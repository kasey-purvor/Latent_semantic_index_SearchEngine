[DOI: 10.1063\/1.1828241]\nI. INTRODUCTION\nPulsed laser ablation (PLA), as a film deposition tech-\nnique and as a chemical analysis tool, has greatly matured\nover the last decade. However, a detailed understanding of\nthe ablation process has proved elusive due to the plethora of\nmechanisms for the removal of target material, the complex\nnature of the initial laser-target interaction, and the dynamic\nnature of the interaction between the plume and the laser\npulse.1\u20133 This complexity is further increased when consid-\nering the ablation of materials that are nominally transparent\nto the laser photons.\nTraditionally PLA has been performed using lasers giv-\ning nanosecond duration pulses. However, the advent of sub-\npicosecond pulsed lasers opened the possibility of decou-\npling the initial photoexcitation of the target material from\nthe subsequent dynamics of the removed atomic, ionic, and\nmolecular plume components. This decoupling removes a\nlayer of complexity from the ablation process, thereby facili-\ntating the investigation and understanding of PLA mecha-\nnisms. Ultrashort pulsed lasers offer dramatically higher\npeak powers than nanosecond lasers. Multiphoton pathways\nfor ablation become more significant at higher incident in-\ntensities. This is of particular importance when considering\nthe ablation of substances with band gaps larger than the\nenergy of the laser photons employed\u2014as, for example, will\ngenerally be the case with the alkali halides.\nProduction of thin coatings of alkali halides, particularly\nLiF, is of significant interest for a variety of reasons. Thin\nLiF coatings have been demonstrated to reduce the work\nfunction of metal electrodes,4 permitting more efficient elec-\ntron injection and field emission. Alkali halide coatings can\nact as effective dipole layers, inducing a negative electron\naffinity in diamond surfaces by lowering the surface work\nfunction.5 KCl and KI coatings have recently been shown to\nincrease the photoluminescence of ZnO crystals by up to 300\ntimes.6 The enhanced electron injection at LiF coated cath-\nodes has also been used to improve the performance of or-\nganic electroluminescence devices.7,8\nPLA is recognized as a versatile and useful technique for\nthe deposition of very thin coatings, but suffers due to the\nproduction of unwanted asperities such as droplets and\nmacroparticles\u2014particularly when applied to the ablation of\nultrawide band gap materials, such as LiF.9,10 For example, a\nKrF excimer laser photon has an energy of 5 eV, while the\nband gap of LiF is in the range 13.6\u201314.5 eV.11,12 Electronic\nsputtering processes would be expected to be the dominant\nmaterial ejection mechanism in such a regime, since band-\nto-band excitation would require a MP absorption process.13\nThere have been relatively few PLA studies of alkali\nhalides,9,10,14\u201316 particularly involving ultrashort pulse\nablation.17\u201319 Several studies of laser interaction with these\nmaterials have concentrated on the subablation threshold\nphotodesorption of ionic species from single crystal\nsurfaces,17,18,20,21 and have typically employed mass spec-\ntroscopy to analyze components in the plume of ejected gas\nphase material. In this article we compare the 248 nm PLA\nof LiF using nanosecond and subpicosecond pulses.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe ablation apparatus consisted of a stainless steel\nvacuum chamber which was evacuated using a turbo-\nmolecular pump, backed by a rotary pump to a base pressure\nof 1310\u22126 Torr. The chamber was equipped with several\nsidearms, each of which was sealed with a quartz window,\npermitting wide spectral-range optical observation of the\nplume produced during ablation. The incident laser beam\npropagated through one of the sidearms, in the xy plane at\n45\u00b0 to the target surface normal\u2014here defined as the x axis.\nThe viewing port lay in the xy plane also and allowed optical\nemission accompanying the ablation plume to be monitored\nby viewing along the y axis (i.e., parallel to the target sur-\nface). The target, a 2-in.-diam sintered disk of 99.9% pure\nLiF (Testbourne, UK), was rotated during the experiments in\norder to avoid repeated ablation of the same spot on the\ntarget. Subpicosecond 248 nm laser pulses were generated\nusing a XeCl excimer pumped dye laser system producing\n450 fs pulses from a distributed feedback dye laser at\n496 nm which, after frequency doubling, were amplified in\nthe KrF excimer laser cavity.22,23 The KrF cavity (Lambda-\nPhysik EMG150MSC), operating unseeded, provided pulses\nof 15 ns full width at half maximum at 248 nm. The outputs\nof the nanosecond excimer laser and the frequency doubled\ndye laser had markedly different spatial profiles, beam diver-\ngences, and peak powers, which meant that these two\nsources produced very different spot sizes when focused at\nthe target. Typical laser pulse energies (and fluences) em-\nployed in the experiments described here were\n,47 mJ\/pulse s12.5 J \/cm2d in the case of nanosecond (ns)\nablation and ,8 mJ\/pulse s12.3 J \/cm2d for the femtosecond\n(fs) studies. Although the fluences used were similar, the\npower density was nearly five orders of magnitude lower for\nthe ns, as compared with the fs, pulses.\nThe optical emission accompanying the ablation plume\nwas collected in two different ways. To record spatially re-\nsolved optical emission spectra (OES) the emission was fo-\ncused (in a 1:1 magnification configuration) onto a quartz\nfiber directed so as to view a column along the y axis. The\nexit of the fiber bundle abutted the entrance slit (width set at\n30 mm) of a 0.32 m spectrograph (TRIAX-320, Jobin Yvon\/\nSpex) equipped with three, user selectable, holographic grat-\nings, with 600, 1800, and 2400 lines\/mm, providing spectral\nresolutions of 0.4, 0.15, and 0.1 nm, respectively. The result-\ning dispersed emission could be recorded over a wavelength\nrange 360\u2013900 nm, using an intensified charge coupled de-\nvice (i-CCD DH520-18F, Andor Technology.) By translating\nthe position of the entrance of the fiber, the variation of the\nOES along the x axis of the plume could be measured. The\nfiber had a diameter of 0.6 mm, which defined the spatial\nresolution. The second method of recording the plume emis-\nsion involved imaging the evolving spatial distributions of\nselected emitting species by using the i-CCD camera in time-\ngated detection mode, decoupling it from the spectrometer,\nand focusing the optical emission (either total emission, or\njust the fraction transmitted through a suitably chosen nar-\nrow bandpass interference filter) onto the 10243256 diode\narray. The spatial calibration of the i-CCD image was\nachieved by taking an image of a rule illuminated by a white\nlight source. The minimum delay, after which an i-CCD im-\nage of the plume could be taken, was limited to 120 ns by\nthe response time of the electronics used.\nDroplet production during the ns and fs ablation of LiF\nwas investigated by placing a number of silicon substrates at\ndifferent angles to the target normal, but at the same radial\ndistance s6 cmd from the ablation spot on the target. A simi-\nlar off-axis ablation geometry was used elsewhere in studies\nof the ns PLA of LiF at 193 nm.10 The droplet density was\nascertained from scanning electron microscope (SEM) im-\nages obtained in a Philips S4000 field emission SEM oper-\nating at 20 kV.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Effect of pulse duration on film deposition\nThe ns ablation of LiF at 193 nm has been shown to\nproduce large numbers of molten droplets by hydrodynamic\nsputtering.9,10 This is thought to be a consequence of the\nlarge penetration depth of such laser photons into LiF,\ncoupled with the relatively low melting point of the material\ns848 \u00b0Cd24 and its high coefficient of thermal expansion\ns373106 K\u22121d.24 During the ns pulse, a sizable depth of ma-\nterial (estimated as ,1 mm for 193 nm ablation10) expands\nrapidly as it is heated and liquefies. When the deeper regions\nof the molten irradiated area solidify and contract, liquid\ndroplets of the surface can be ejected.13\nThe initial temperature rise within the irradiated region\ncan be expected to be much more rapid in the case of fs\nablation, since the energy is delivered over a time scale that\nis short compared to the rate of phonon-phonon coupling. In\nthis regime, material will be vaporized more quickly, reduc-\ning the extent of hydrodynamic sputtering. In order to com-\npare the production of droplets from ns and fs ablation, films\nwere deposited on substrates mounted at a range of different\nangles to the x axis. Figure 1 shows SEM images of the films\nproduced by LiF ablation using 500 ns laser pulses [left-hand\nside, images (a)\u2013(d)] and one thousand fs pulses [right-hand\nside, images (e)\u2013(h)]. The substrates were placed at angles to\nthe target normal of (a) and (e) 0\u00b0, (b) and (f) 15\u00b0, (c) and (g)\n45\u00b0 and (d) and (h) 60\u00b0. A high density of asperities, charac-\nterized as splashed droplets, are observed in the films grown\nusing both ns and fs laser pulses, but the droplet density is\nseen to decrease as the deposition angle was increased. Com-\nparing films deposited with ns and fs pulses we see that, at\nall angles u, the size and density of droplets is much reduced\nin the case of fs PLA, especially when it is recalled that\ntwice as many pulses were used in the production of these\nfilms.\nFigure 2 shows a plot of the droplet density per ns (up-\nper curve) and fs (lower curve) laser shot obtained from\nanalysis of a range of images similar to those shown in Fig.\n1. Image processing was carried out using commercial image\n023304-2 Henley, Fuge, and Ashfold J. Appl. Phys. 97, 023304 (2005)\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The error\nbars represent the standard error on the mean droplet density\ntaken from three images from different areas on the same\nsample. The line fitted to the fs data gives an angular depen-\ndence of the droplet density of approximately cos2.6sud. No\nsensible fitting of the nanosecond droplet density was pos-\nsible as the larger drops, at the higher densities, masked the\nunderlying distribution of smaller droplets. This can be seen\nmost dramatically in Fig. 1(a), where the largest droplets\n(which appear to have struck the substrate while still molten,\nand have very low aspect ratios) take up a considerable frac-\ntion of the surface area. Clearly, for both ns and fs ablation,\nthe droplet density is much reduced by growing in an off-\naxis geometry. However, these images give little information\nabout the relative film thickness as a function of pulse dura-\ntion and the angle at which the substrate is mounted. If the\ndroplet density is less at higher angles, but the film thickness\nis reduced by a greater factor, the volume fraction of particu-\nlates will actually be increased. Even if this was the case,\nhowever, the droplet size is much reduced by depositing at\nhigher angles, so the film quality is likely to be improved.\nWe note that the contrast in the SEM images shown in Figs.\n1(a)\u20131(c) appears different from the other images, including\nthose of all films deposited with fs pulses. The background in\nimages (a)\u2013(c) shows up brighter than the droplets, whereas\nthis contrast is reversed for the other films. Such an observa-\ntion is characteristic of surface charging, and implies that the\n(insulating LiF) film thickness is significantly larger in the\ncase of films deposited with ns pulses.\nB. Spatially resolved optical emission spectroscopy\nExcited species in the plume were investigated by moni-\ntoring OES spectra at different positions along the x axis.\nFigure 3 shows OES spectra covering the wavelength range\n570\u2013700 nm taken at different distances from the laser-\ntarget interaction region using (a) ns and (b) fs pulses. Signal\nwas collected in a 1 ms gate on the spectrometer, which\nopens at t=120 ns after the laser pulse is incident on the\ntarget. This spectral region is dominated by the two main Li\nI spectral lines. The relevant portion of the Grotrain diagram\nof neutral Li is shown above (a). Other Li I emissions were\nobserved in other spectral regions of the spectrum, most no-\ntably the 3s\u21922p transition at 812.6 nm (also shown in the\ninset), but all were much weaker than the 610.4 and\n670.8 nm emissions (henceforth termed the Li a and Li b\nemissions, respectively). As Fig. 3 shows, the relative inten-\nFIG. 1.

The former were obtained using 500 laser shots,\nwhile the latter were the result of 1000 fs laser pulses. The substrates were\nplaced at angles to the target normal of (a) and (e) 0\u00b0, (b) and (f) 15\u00b0, (c) and\n(g) 45\u00b0 and (d) and (h) 60\u00b0.\nFIG. 2.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nsities of these two peaks are sensitively dependent on the\nlaser pulse duration used. Li a emission dominates the OES\nspectrum accompanying ns PLA, and the ratio of the Li a to\nLi b emission intensities is greater for ns PLA than for fs\nPLA at all x. This is at first sight surprising, given that the\nemitting s3dd states responsible for Li a emission lie higher\nin energy. The explanation for these differences lies in the\nfact that the Li b emission terminates at the ground s2sd state,\nand so can be reabsorbed if there is a significant population\nof ground state neutral Li atoms. As the asymptotic fate of all\ngas phase Li atoms is the ground electronic state, a signifi-\ncant population of Lis2sd atoms is to be expected. Inspection\nof the (Li a):(Li b) intensity ratio in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) leads\nto the conclusion that self-absorption of the Li b emission is\nmuch more important in the case of ns ablation than in fs\nablation plume\u2014which appears optically thin in comparison.\nSuch accords with the conclusions drawn from analysis of\nthe deposited films, which indicate a much greater material\nremoval per pulse in the case of ns PLA. This aspect is\ninvestigated further below, using plume imaging techniques,\nand will be discussed later.\nOES spectra recorded following fs ablation [Fig. 3(b)]\nshow additional weak lines between the Li a and Li b tran-\nsitions. Figure 4 shows a magnified section of OES spectra\ntaken 7 mm from the laser interaction volume for both ns\n(lower trace) and fs (upper spectrum) PLA. Three additional\nlines are clearly evident, at 624.0, 634.9, and 641.4 nm, in\nthe case of fs laser excitation only. All three are attributable\nto 3p\u21923s transitions in atomic fluorine, and originate from\nan excited state that lies 14.68 eV above the ground state.26\nC. Time resolved imaging of specific plume\nemissions\nBefore discussing the temporal evolution of the optical\nemission from the plume, it is important to reflect on the\ntime scales involved. The radiative lifetimes (i.e., the times\nduring which an initial excited state population will decay by\na factor of e\u22121 under collision-free conditions) of excited\nstates responsible for the stronger Li I emissions are shown\nin Table I. However, in the following results, it will be shown\nthat Li I emissions are still readily detectable after .10 life-\ntimes, by which time the spontaneous emission intensities\nshould have dropped by a factor of 104.\nA mechanism for populating the observed emitting lev-\nels after the ablation event is required in order to explain the\nduration of the observed emissions. Recombination of Li+\nions and electrons, stabilized by a third body, (or Li+ neutral-\nization by electron transfer from F\u2212 ions) constitutes one\nobvious source of excited neutral Li atoms. As suggested\npreviously,27 such electron ion recombination (EIR) is likely\nto proceed via highly excited Rydberg states, and subsequent\nradiative (and\/or collisional) cascade via the monitored tran-\nsitions and, ultimately, to the ground electronic state, as\nshown in Eq. (1)\nLi+ + e \u2192 Li * * shigh n,,,md\n\u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Li * * s3d or 3sd\n\u2192 Li * s2pd \u2192 Lis2sd . s1d\nIn this scenario, the observed distribution of emitting\nneutrals will reflect the degree to which the overall Li+ and e\n(or F\u2212) distributions overlap in space and time. Here we use\ntime-gated i-CCD imaging, in conjunction with narrow\nbandpass interference filters that enable selection of specific\ntransitions (and thus emitting species), to gain some insight\ninto the production and evolution of selected excited species\nin the ablation plumes formed in both fs and ns PLA. As\ncommented previously, Li b emission can be reabsorbed by\nground state Li atoms (exciting them back to the 2p state),\nwhereas the Li a emission connects two excited states, nei-\nther of which are expected to have large steady state popu-\nlations. Comparing time-gated images of the Li a and Li b\nemissions thus allows estimation of the extent of radiation\ntrapping and thus some insight into the evolving distribution\nof ground state Li atoms in the plume.\nFigure 5 shows a series of wavelength filtered CCD im-\nages (viewed along y) of the plume accompanying ns PLA of\nLiF. The images were all collected using a 20 ns time gate\nbut at different delays: t=120 ns for images (a)\u2013(d), t\n=520 ns for (e)\u2013(h), and t=800 ns for (i)\u2013(l). Images (a), (e),\nand (i) (the top row) are unfiltered images, whereas (b), (f),\nand (j) (second row) are taken through a 610 nm narrow pass\nfilter that transmits just the Li a emission, (c), (g), and (k)\n(third row) with a 670 nm narrow pass filter so as to select\nthe Li b emission, and (d), (h), and (l) (bottom row) using a\nlong pass filter that only transmits wavelengths .780 nm,\nthereby sampling predominantly the 812.4 nm Li I emission.\nThe white arrow in (a) indicates the axis of laser irradiation,\nwith the beam incident at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the surface\nnormal. The images were averaged over multiple laser shots.\nThe intensity measured at each pixel of the CCD is stored to\nallow later profiling of the intensity distribution, but the dis-\nFIG. 4.

Comparing Figs. 5(i), 5(j), and 5(l), it is\nclear that the distribution and evolution of the total OES\nsignal mirrors that of the selected images of Li a and the\n.780 nm (mainly 812.6 nm Li I) emissions. Such a finding\nis consistent with the spatially resolved wavelength dispersed\nOES spectra shown in Fig. 3, which are dominated by the Li\na peak. The Li b emission shows a strikingly different time\nevolution, however, which can be described by studying a\nseries of images recorded at progressively longer times. At\nearly time, the Li b emission appears to peak at an x value\nbehind the maximum of the Li a image. At t,520 ns, the\ndistribution shows a double maximum along the x axis [see\nFig. 5(g)]. The first is closer to the laser-target interaction\nregion than the peak of the Li a emission, the second more\ndistant. The relative intensities of the leading (i.e., further\nfrom the ablation spot) and trailing maxima evolve with in-\ncreasing t, so that by t,800 ns the Li b emission profile\nagain shows a single maximum that is significantly further\nforward than the peak in the Li a emission profile recorded at\nthe same t. The observed time dependence of the Li b emis-\nsion profile provides further illustration of the dramatic ef-\nfects of self-absorption. As we show later, comparisons of\nthe corresponding Li a and Li b images allow estimation of\nthe time and spatial distribution of the ground state Li atoms.\nA similar set of images was obtained following fs PLA\nof LiF. A selection of these are shown in Fig. 6. Three images\nare shown in each horizontal row of this figure. Each was\nrecorded using a 20 ns collection gate which was delayed by,\nrespectively, t=120, 280, and 460 ns. Images displayed in\nthe top row are of the total emission, while those in the\nsecond and third rows were observed through, respectively,\n610 and 670 nm narrow bandpass filters. Consistent with\nFig. 3(b), the time-gated image of the total OES signal is\nfound to be approximated well by a weighted sum of the Li\na and Li b distributions, with the latter making the greater\ncontribution. Such an observation contrasts with that found\nin the case of ns PLA. The time evolution of the Li b emis-\nsion profile appears less complicated in the case of fs PLA;\nat all t, the observed Li b emission profile peaks in front of\nthat of the Li a profile. Comparing images displayed in the\nfirst columns of Figs. 5 and 6 (both of which sets were taken\nat t=120 ns), we see that the emitting region of the plume\nappears larger in the case of fs PLA, implying a greater\nexpansion velocity for material ejected when ablating with\nthe shorter pulse duration.\nAs previously,27 estimates of the mean velocities kvl of\nthe emitting components in the plume could be derived as\nfollows. The emission intensity profiles along the x axis of\neach of the captured time-gated CCD images were first ana-\nlyzed, and the peak (or peaks) found by fitting with suitable\nmathematical functions, the exact nature of which was pro-\nfile dependent and were merely used to obtain empirical fits.\nFigure 7 shows illustrative cuts from images of the filtered Li\nb emission recorded at t=200 and 600 ns for the case of (a)\nfs and (b) ns PLA of LiF.

After fitting all of the profiles,\nthe derived peak positions xpeak were plotted as a function of\ntime delay t for both the Li a and Li b emissions, from both\nns and fs PLA. Results for the Li a emission arising in the ns\nPLA, shown in Fig. 8(a), fit to a reasonable straight line, the\ngradient of which implies a value of kvl=10.9\u00b10.4 km\/s for\nthe emitting species. Figure 8(b) shows the corresponding\nplot for the Li b s670 nmd emission arising in the ns PLA of\nLiF. The Li b intensity profiles generally show two maxima,\nthe relative intensities of which are seen to swap over at t\n,600 ns. Only the xpeak value of the predominant peak is\nplotted in the xpeak versus t plot displayed in Fig. 8(b)\u2014\nhence the discontinuity around t,600 ns. The gradient of\nthe early time part of this plot gives kvl=7.1\u00b10.1 km\/s,\nwhile the later part gives a much faster value kvl\n=24.1\u00b10.5 km\/s. The corresponding xpeak vs t plots for the\nLi a and Li b emissions accompanying fs PLA of LiF are\nshown in Figs. 8(c) and 8(d). The former gives kvl\n=13\u00b10.5 km\/s, while the latter plot shows some similarity\nwith the later part of the equivalent ns ablation plot [Fig.\n8(b)]. We note that the distance axis intercept of a line drawn\nthrough this data will miss the origin by a significant amount\nindicating that, as with the equivalent ns data, the effect of\nself-absorption on the emission profile cannot be ignored.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nThe optical emissions accompanying 248 nm PLA of\nLiF, and the conclusions that might be drawn there from, are\nseen to be sensitively dependent both on the laser pulse du-\nration and the particular transition chosen for monitoring. In\naddition, we find that the choice of pulse duration also leads\nto dramatic differences in the number and size of droplets\nproduced by hydrodynamic sputtering. We now consider\nwhat insights these observations provide regarding the pre-\nvailing ablation mechanisms, and their dependence on the\npulse duration.\nThe observed optical emission from both ns and fs PLA\nis dominated by transitions associated with neutral Li. We\npostulate that these emissions arise mainly as a result of neu-\ntralization of Li+ ions, by EIR, possibly supplemented by\ncharge transfer from F\u2212 ions. Thus we must consider sources\nof Li+ ions, for both ns and fs pulses, and the availability of\nelectrons to take part in the EIR process. Likely sources of\nLi+ ions in the PLA of LiF include direct ejection of ions by\nphoton stimulated desorption (PSD) and the absorption of\nlaser radiation [e.g., via inverse brehmsstrahlung excitation\n(IBE)] within the ablation plume, leading to heating, excita-\ntion, and ionization of the plume constituents.\nThe PSD of Li+ ions from LiF single crystals has been\ninvestigated previously, using both ns20,21 and fs21 laser\npulses. Li+ photodesorbed from LiF surfaces was observed in\nboth cases, even at subablation threshold fluences. Joly,\nBeck, and Hess21 determined average kinetic energies (KEs)\nof ,5 eV and ,10 eV for Li+ ions desorbed following\n266 nm excitation of LiF using, respectively, ns and fs laser\npulses. These authors also determined that the energy thresh-\nolds and power dependences for Li+ ion formation were\nsimilar in the two cases, notwithstanding the expectation that\ndifferent excitation mechanisms would likely dominate when\nusing such different laser pulses durations. Bandis, Langford,\nand Dickinson20 reported a similar KE s6.7 eVd for Li+ ions\ndesorbed in the ns pulsed laser excitation of LiF at 248 nm,\nand noted that this KE value (and those of the cations from\nother alkali and alkaline earth halide crystals) matched well\nwith the predictions of a model which assumed that the elec-\ntrostatic energy of the ion prior to expulsion is converted into\nKE, with little partitioned into inelastic processes such as\nlattice distortions or phonon emission. PSD can also be ex-\npected to produce a significant amount of neutral material\nalong with the ionic component\u2014to which, of course, the ion\ntime-of-flight (TOF) experiments are insensitive. If there is a\nthermal component to this PSD derived source of neutral\nmaterial it will surely be more important in the case of ns\nPLA since, under fs excitation, irradiation will have finished\nbefore phonon-phonon coupling has the chance to cause\nmuch increase in the temperature of the lattice.\nThe relative importance of laser-plume interactions is\nalso heavily dependent upon the laser pulse duration, becom-\ning increasingly significant as the laser pulse duration in-\ncreases. The ionization potential of Li s5.4 eVd is much\nFIG. 8.

The gradients of the best-fit lines\nin (a) and (c) give respective mean velocities of 10.9\u00b10.4 km\/s and\n13\u00b10.5 km\/s.\n023304-6 Henley, Fuge, and Ashfold J. Appl. Phys. 97, 023304 (2005)\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nlower than that of F s17.4 eVd. The KrF photon energy is\n5.0 eV. Such photons thus provide enough energy to ionize\nall excited states of the Li atom. In addition, we note that the\n6p\u21902s absorptions of Li fall within the KrF laser band-\nwidth, thus offering a facile route to resonance enhanced two\nphoton ionization of ground state Li atoms. In contrast, a\nground state F atom would have to absorb at least 4 KrF\nphotons to be ionized. Li atoms are thus by far the most\nreadily ionizable species within the plume.\nGiven these background considerations, we propose that\nlaser-plume interactions will be rather minor in the case of fs\nPLA and that much of the Li+ ion yield is produced by direct\nlaser-target interactions, such as PSD. The plasma-annealing\nmodel28 has been applied to explain the highly ionized nature\nof materials irradiated with ultrashort laser pulses. In this\nmodel, the high levels of excitation produced by the laser\npromote a significant proportion of the electrons into excited\nstates, rendering the lattice unbound and transforming mate-\nrial in the laser interaction volume into a high-density\nplasma. Note that if purely fast thermal evaporation were\noccurring during fs irradiation, little or no ionic material\nwould be expected, as the ejection temperatures (typically\n,1 eV) are significantly lower than the relevant ionization\npotentials. The model prediction that the ratio of the ion to\nneutral desorption yields will be much higher in the case of\nfs PLA is born out experimentally, in as much that F* emis-\nsion (which we attribute to F++e\u2192F*) was only observed in\nthe fs PLA of LiF (see Fig. 4). The xpeak vs t plot of the Li a\nemission accompanying fs PLA of LiF [Figure 8(c)] has a\ngradient kvl=13\u00b10.5 km\/s, equivalent to a KE of ,6.1 eV.\nEmission at this wavelength will be much less sensitive to\nthe effects of any radiation trapping than the Li b emission.\nSuch plots should thus provide a reasonable measure of the\nvelocity of the emitting Li* atoms in the plume. The simi-\nlarity between this KE value and that obtained by Joly, Beck,\nand Hess21 from TOF mass spectroscopy lends further sup-\nport to the proposal that emitting Li* atoms can be a useful\nsurrogate for their precursor Li+ ions. We recognize that the\nfluences used in the present work are significantly higher\nthan those employed by Joly and co-workers, but also note\nthat these authors reported a small shift to earlier arrival time\n(i.e., higher KE) as the fluence was reduced. Such an in-\ncrease in KE with reduced fluence is of course the opposite\nto that which might be expected if either surface or space\ncharge effects were controlling the velocity distribution. As\ndiscussed previously,27 there are also a number of reasons\nwhy analyses of the OES of excited neutrals of the kind\nreported here are likely to underestimate the true kvl of na-\nscent ions (even in the limit that EIR is entirely responsible\nfor the emitting species). One obvious limitation is that the\nmeasured images are squashed two-dimensional projections\nof a three-dimensional cloud of emitting particles. We ana-\nlyze a slice along x, but not all emitting particles fly along\nthe surface normal; the velocity of any emitting particles\nwith some component along y will be underestimated. Fur-\nther, true proportionality between Li+ and Li* would require\nan EIR efficiency that is independent of x. In practice, such\ncollision-induced processes are likely to be less efficient in\nless dense (i.e., peripheral) regions of the plume.\nDuring a ns pulse the temperature of the irradiated re-\ngion of the target will increase rapidly until it boils. The\nlarger size and much higher density of \u201csplashed\u201d droplets\nobserved in the films deposited by ns PLA suggests that the\ntarget surface may have spent some significant time in a\nmolten state prior to material boiloff. If Li atoms were to\nboiloff the target surface at the boiling point sTboild of LiF\ns,1676 \u00b0Cd, the resulting Li atoms (of mass m) would have\na mean speed s8kTboil \/pmd\n1\n2 =2.44 km\/s. Some fraction of\nthese Li atoms will be ionized by laser-plume interactions.\nThus the distribution of Li+ ions resulting from ns PLA of\nLiF is likely to be a fusion of two components both of which\nrequire the presence of the laser radiation: one generated\ndirectly by PSD, the second from laser-plume interactions,\nwhich are then mediated by Coulombic interactions between\nthe electrons and ions. Contributions from PSD will likely\nmaximize early in the laser pulse. Laser-plume interactions\nwill increase as the plume density increases and, in extreme\ncases, may attenuate the laser intensity reaching the target\nsubstantially. The mean velocity for Li+ ions we deduce from\nanalysis of the Li a OES is kvl=10.9\u00b10.4 km\/s [see Fig.\n8(a)] equivalent to a KE of ,4.3 eV. Similar analysis of the\nns plume images obtained using the .780 nm filter gives\nkvl=11.5\u00b10.4 km\/s\u2014consistent with the view that the Li I\nemission at 812.6 nm is the dominant contributor to this long\nwavelength emission. Both estimates of the Li+ ion velocity\nare comparable to, but somewhat lower than, the value de-\nduced above for the case of fs PLA of LiF. By way of com-\nparison, Bandis20 deduced a mean KE ,6 eV (and a full\nwidth half maximum ,3 eV) for the photodesorbed Li+ ions\nproduced in the subthreshold ns irradiation of LiF, while\nJoly21 obtained a mean KE value of 5 eV\u2014albeit at incident\nfluences significantly lower than those used in the current\nwork.\nWe now consider the distributions of ground state mate-\nrial in the plume. The plume images filtered so as to select\nthe Li a s3d\u21922pd and Li b s2p\u21922sd emissions are dramati-\ncally different, particularly in the case of ns PLA. Given the\nshort radiative lifetimes of the 3d and 2p levels (relative to\nthe observation times), we can envisage no reason why the\ntrue distribution of Li* s3dd or Li* s3sd atoms should differ\nsignificantly from that for Li* s2pd. Hence the conclusion\nthat the differences between the respective emission distribu-\ntions must be a consequence of reabsorption of photons pro-\nduced by Li b decay by a high density of ground state Li\natoms. The Li a transition, in contrast, terminates on an ex-\ncited state s2pd, the steady state number density of which\nwill be much lower than that of the ground state. Its intensity\nprofile should thus be much less affected by radiation trap-\nping. Differences between the Li a and Li b images recorded\nat any given t might thus provide some insight into the dis-\ntribution of ground state Li atoms at that time. This was\nachieved by rescaling the intensity sId vs x distribution de-\nrived from each Li b image so that it matched the large x part\nof the corresponding Li a distribution, on the basis that this is\na region where the density of ground state Li atoms will be\nlowest, and the effect of self-absorption of the Li b emission\nleast important. A first estimate of the attenuation profile was\n023304-7 Henley, Fuge, and Ashfold J. Appl. Phys. 97, 023304 (2005)\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nthen obtained by dividing the I vs x distribution of the Li a\nemission by that of the Li b emission. This process was\nrepeated for the range of CCD images taken at different x\nfollowing ns PLA of LiF. Figure 9 shows three attenuation\nprofiles so derived. The t=280 ns profile [Fig. 9(a)] is quite\nsharp, and peaks ahead of xpeak for the corresponding Li a\nemission. By t=600 ns [Fig. 9(b)] the attenuation profile is\nmuch broader and shows a hint of bimodality, and by t\n=800 ns the profile is broader still, and appears to peak at\nsmaller x than the xpeak value observed at 600 ns.\nAs commented previously, we can envisage two limiting\nmechanisms that may contribute to the distribution of ejected\nmaterial\u2014one, PSD, essentially electronic in origin, the\nother thermal. We anticipate that the \u201czero-order\u201d kinetic en-\nergy distributions of the ablated Li (and F) atoms and ions\narising via the two mechanisms will be different, but that the\ntwo distributions will fuse with increasing t. Given the evi-\ndence of molten particulates in the deposited films, we can\nalso anticipate a major thermal contribution to the ablation\nplume. It is hard to reconcile such a picture with the appar-\nently narrow, \u201cfast\u201d distribution of ground state Li atoms\nimplied by the t=280 ns attenuation profile. The long time\nst=800 nsd attenuation profile is much closer to the shifted\nMaxwellian velocity distribution that is characteristic of\nmost ablation plumes.3\nFigure 10 shows a plot of the centers of gravity skxld of\nthe deduced attenuation profiles as a function of t. Such a\nplot of propagation distance versus time should pass through\nthe origin; the long time measurements thus correspond to a\nmean propagation velocity kvl,8.5 km\/s but, clearly, the\ndeduced kxl values at early t appear to be too large. This\napparent deviation from the (expected) constant expansion\nvelocity, and the seemingly unphysical nature of the ground\nstate velocity distribution implied by the attenuation profiles\nderived at short t, both highlight a shortcoming of the pre-\nceding analysis\u2014namely the assumption that the Li a emis-\nsion is immune to the effects of self-absorption. Radiation\ntrapping will be most important in the densest regions of the\nplume, i.e., at early t, before the ablated material has ex-\npanded into an ever increasing volume. The self-absorption\nconsidered thus far is of Li b emission, but the net effect of\nthe emission-reabsorption cycle is to maintain an excessive\n(relative to local thermal equilibrium) population in the 2p\nstate which will serve to attenuate the 3d\u21922p and 3s\u21922p\nemissions in the densest regions of the plume. The effect of\nsuch reabsorption is imperceptible in the t=800 ns profile\n[Fig. 9(c)]\u2014where the plume density is lowest, but is re-\nsponsible for the central dip in the t=600 ns profile [Fig.\n9(b)] and the apparent dramatic loss of \u201cattenuation\u201d (and\nthus the implied absence of ground state Li atoms) at small x\nin the t=280 ns profile [Fig. 9(a)]. Thus, the sharp peak in\nthe deduced attenuation profile is a consequence of the\nmethod used to estimate the attenuation. At small t, both the\nLi a and Li b signals are affected by reabsorption, so their\nratio no longer represents simply the attenuation by ground\nstate Li atoms. It should be noted that the collected OES\nintensity at a point on the CCD is a summation of all the\nemission produced along a line perpendicular to the x axis.\nFor this reason it would be difficult to obtain an numerical\nestimate of the density of absorbing material, without previ-\nously knowing what the intensity would be without the effect\nof attenuation, and how the plume density varies along the\nline of sight.\nThe observed attenuation is significantly less in the fs\nablation experiments, indicating that the density of ground\nstate Li atoms was lower in the case of fs PLA. This must be\nprimarily due to the general reduction in the amount of ab-\nlated material (as the total energy delivered is less for the fs\npulses), supplemented by a reduction in the relative yield of\nground state neutrals. The reduction in the number of drop-\nlets, along with the more intense F emission detected in the\nplume, is evidence for characterizing the fs ablation as ex-\nplosive boiling rather than thermal sputtering. The low melt-\ning point and high thermal expansion coefficient of LiF\nwould mean that significant hydrodynamic sputtering would\nFIG. 9.

For ns ablation at 193 nm,\nmelting of the target surface was clearly observed.10 The\nOES images following fs ablation at 248 nm, filtered to show\nthe Li b emission, show evidence for some radiation trap-\nping. Comparing Figs. 6(b) and 6(c) or Figs. 6(e) and 6(f), it\nis observed that the region of most obvious attenuation of the\nLi b emission always occurs at the same position as the peak\nin the Li a images. The evolution of this attenuation profile\n(not shown here) is much simpler for the fs images, with no\nevidence for any reabsorption of the Li a peak at small t.\nThis serves to reinforce the view that the density of ground\nstate material in the plume is significantly lower in the case\nof fs PLA, and that re-population of Lis2pd as a result of\nradiation trapping is much less important in this case. Since\nIBE within the plume will be relatively much less important\nin the case of fs PLA, the Li+ ions invoked to account for the\nobserved optical transitions must be formed during the initial\nlaser-target interaction. Thus we should anticipate a much\nreduced contribution from any slower, thermally evolved\ncomponent, and a relatively higher kvl for the Li+ ions in the\nplume (and thus for the imaged Li* atoms) than in the case\nof ns PLA. Such expectations accord with experimental ob-\nservation.\nV. CONCLUSION\nPLA of LiF using fs pulses at 248 nm was found to\nproduce a plume with a higher proportion of energetic\/\nelectrically excited components, including excited F atoms\nand ions, than that from ns PLA of the same material at the\nsame wavelength. However, the amount of target material\nremoved per shot was significantly less. Ns ablation pro-\nduces a plume with a much higher density of ground state Li\natoms, as revealed by the evident reabsorption of Lis2p\n\u21922sd optical emission. Films grown by fs PLA, especially\nthose deposited on substrates mounted in an off-axis geom-\netry, are contaminated with fewer (and smaller) droplets.\nSuch observations imply that fs PLA of LiF exhibits charac-\nteristics of explosive boiling, whereas ns ablation is domi-\nnated by thermal evaporation of the transiently heated target\nsurface.\nOptical emission measurements are often used to pro-\nvide an estimate of the expansion velocity of material in\nablation plumes. The present work highlights some of the\npotential pitfalls associated with such measurements, most\nobviously when the monitored emission involves transition\nto a state [here the ground s2sd state] that is present in high\nnumber density. Radiation trapping in such cases can result\nin very misleading spatial and temporal emission profiles.\nComparisons of time-gated spatially resolved images of the\nLis3d\u21922pd and Lis2p\u21922sd emissions arising in the ns PLA\nof LiF enabled estimation of the distribution of ground state\nLi atoms in the plume. Indeed, more thorough analysis of\nthese images revealed that the density of Lis2pd atoms in the\nearly stages of the plume expansion was sufficiently high (as\na result of Lis2p\u21902sd reabsorption) that even the Lis3d\n\u21922pd emission profiles accompanying ns PLA of LiF show\nevidence of radiation trapping. These observations serve to\nreinforce the view that the plume arising in the ns PLA of\nLiF contains a much higher density of ground state material\nthan that formed using fs pulses.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Demetrios Anglos and Costas Fotakis\nfor their assistance with this project and S.J.H. and G.M.F.\nwould like to thank A.
