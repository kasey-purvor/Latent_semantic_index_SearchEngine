Background\nThe low-cost, sensitive detection of methane gas has wide use amongst the gas utility\ncompanies for both routine pipeline inspection and leak-report response applications [1].\nThe conventional approach to leak detection is based upon flame ionisation detectors\n[2] (FID) but such technology measures concentration at only a single point. Using a\npoint sensor is problematic in that the leak may be overlooked, the user may have to\nenter potentially explosive situations and that above-ground pipe-work could be diffi-\ncult to access. This paper details the design and operational performance of an optical\ninstrument capable of measuring methane at a range of several metres with a sensitivity\nclose to that required for detecting the atmospheric background of 1.6ppm.\nA variety of instruments based on optical absorption of light can be configured to\ndetect gas over the line of sight of a light beam. Sophisticated LIDAR instruments [3]\nhave been reported using pulsed-lasers, tuned to the resonant frequency of the target gas,\nwhere backscattered light from the gas in the atmosphere gives both gas concentration\n(from the size of the signal) and range (from the delay time). Such instruments are\nusually vehicle or aircraft based, are rarely eye-safe and have a cost\/complexity that\nlimits their wide-spread use. Our approach has been to dispense with the need for range\ninformation and rely on the deliberate backscattered signal obtained from the ground or\nbuilding over a range of only several metres, thereby giving a larger continuous signal,\ndetectable with a lower cost\/complexity instrument.\n2. Operating principles of the optical gas detector\nMethane gas has its strongest absorption in the 3 micron spectral region, but corre-\nsponding laser sources, including cryogenically cooled laser diodes and optical para-\nmetric oscillators, exceed the cost budget for a hand-held system. Methane has an\nadditional absorption \u03bd3 band at 1.6 microns which, although over one order of magni-\ntude weaker, does coincide with the single-mode, single-frequency emission wavelength\nof InGaAs distributed feedback laser diodes [4]. Furthermore, diode lasers are readily\ntemperature-tuned to match the absorption wavelength, and subsequent control of their\ndrive current gives fine scale tuning and the option of wavelength modulation. InGaAs\ndiode lasers can be readily tuned over a few percent of their operating wavelength by\nchanging their temperature and over several GHz by changing the drive current. How-\never, day-to-day variation in their tuning parameters means that absolute wavelength\nstability is problematic - and a wide wavelength scan of a gas filled reference cell is\nrequired. Remote hand-held gas detection instruments have been reported previously\n[5], but our incorporation of a dedicated laser module with internal reference cells means\nthat we are assured that the laser is operating at the correct wavelength and that the\nintegrity of the zero gas signal is assured - a key requirement in all safety critical envi-\nronments.\nAn open-path, hand-held laser system... 3\nGiven a tuneable laser source, a number of spectroscopic techniques can be applied\nto the detection of gas, including, photo-acoustics [6], cavity ring-down [7], amplitude,\nwavelength or frequency modulation [8]. Although highly sensitive to small absorp-\ntions, photo-acoustic and cavity ring-down techniques require dedicated sample cells\nand are therefore not suited to open-path applications. Using a laser tuned exactly\nto the absorption wavelength of the gas could be used to monitor the absorption and\nhence gas concentration but in our configuration a change in detected power could also\narise from a change in range or backscattering surface, rather than gas concentration.\nIt is common practice in such situations to rely on a rapid modulation of the laser fre-\nquency\/wavelength in the neighbourhood of the gas absorption giving a corresponding\nmodulation in the detected power, the magnitude of which is related to the gas concen-\ntration. When the modulation frequency is comparable to the modulation depth and\nlarge compared to the width of the gas absorption, the technique is called frequency\nmodulation spectroscopy. When the modulation frequency is small compared to the\nmodulation depth and width of gas absorption, the technique is called wavelength mod-\nulation spectroscopy [9]. Both techniques have been widely implemented [10] and are\ncapable of measuring small absorptions with a sensitivity approaching that limited by\nthe shot noise fluctuations in the power of the laser itself. For the spectroscopy of gases at\natmospheric pressure, the absorption width typically approaches 1GHz, meaning that\nthe modulation and demodulation required for frequency modulation spectroscopy is\ntechnologically challenging. Consequently, wavelength modulation is the natural choice\nas a spectroscopic technique for detection of gases at atmospheric pressure.\nCurrent modulation of the laser wavelength over the absorption line of the gas\nresults in a modulation of the detected laser power, the phase and amplitude of which\nis readily measured using a lock-in-amplifier. The amplitude of the nth harmonic of the\nmodulated power is proportional to the nth derivative of the detected power. Within our\ninstrument we use first, second and third harmonic demodulation to give respectively,\nthe first, second and third derivatives of the absorption as a function of wavelength.\nNote that, of these harmonics it is the second derivative that has a maximum value at\nthe wavelength corresponding to the centre of the absorption feature.\n3. Our instrument design\nOur instrument is configured as an optical head containing laser diode module, temper-\nature control electronics, collection lens and photodiode. This is coupled to a separate\ncontrol box containing the microprocessor control, analogue to digital interface, laser\ndiode driver and multiple lock-in-amplifiers\/phase shifters. A photo of the complete\ninstrument is shown in figure 1.\nThe laser diode module is mounted in a standard 14 pin butterfly package incorpo-\nAn open-path, hand-held laser system... 4\nFigure 1. Left: Complete instrument package, Right: Field testing of prototype\ninstrument\nFigure 2. Completed laser diode module package\nrating the 1651nm laser diode mounted on a thermoelectric cooler, a 4.5mm focal length\naspheric lens to collimate the emission from the front facet, and a separate photodiode\nmonitoring the rear facet emission. The commercially available monitor photodiode\npackage (TO) is filled with methane gas, forming a reference cell from which the oper-\nating wavelength of the laser can be controlled. The 1mm thickness of gas between the\ndiode and package window gives an absorption of approximately 4% at 1651nm. The\noptical layout and photo of complete laser module is shown in figure 2.\nThe near-collimated laser beam emerges from the optical head and is backscattered\nfrom any object in the beam. The backscattered light is collected using a 150mm diam-\neter, 80mm focal length, plastic Fresnel lens that focuses the light onto a 1mm diameter\nInGaAs signal photodiode with integral preamplifier. This detector is shielded from\nexcess sunlight, which would otherwise saturate the amplifiers, by a 100nm bandwidth\nfilter centred at 1680nm. Typically when pointed at a wall or ground at a distance of\n3-5metres the backscattered signal is of the order of 10-100 nW compared to the noise\nAn open-path, hand-held laser system... 5\nTemperature \nController\nDiode\nController\nPeltier at \nfixed temp\nLaser Diode\nDetector\nFresnel\nLens\nCollimating\nLens\nPhase Sensitive \nDetection\nRef cell\nReference\nDetector\nFigure 3. Schematic diagram showing signal path through the system\nequivalent power of the detector of 2.9pW\/\n\u221a\nHz (1.5x106V\/A gain, 3Hz bandwidth).\nThe laser diode driver (Wavelength Electronics) is housed within the shoulder-\nstrapped control box and the laser current drive is fed to the optical head via a shielded\nmulti-core cable, which also feeds the amplified signals from both monitor and signal\nphotodiode back to the control box. The laser diode driver supplies a DC current of\napproximately 70mA giving a laser output power of around 8mW. Superimposed upon\nthis DC level is a 6kHz modulation with an amplitude of 6mA, sufficient to modulate\nthe laser wavelength over the width of the methane absorption. Within the control box,\nAn open-path, hand-held laser system... 6\nthe DC voltage from the monitor photodiode is read directly by the microprocessor to\nconfirm laser operation.\nThe photodiode signals are demodulated at various harmonic frequencies using\nAnalogue Devices AD630 integrated circuits. The monitor photodiode signal is de-\nmodulated at both 12 and 18kHz. The 12kHz demodulated signal corresponds to the\nsecond-derivative of the absorption, a signal which is a maximum and symmetric about\nthe centre of the absorption feature, and is used to confirm the operating wavelength of\nthe laser. The 18kHz demodulated signal corresponds to the third derivative, a signal\nwhich is zero and anti symmetric about the centre of the absorption feature, providing\nan error voltage enabling the software to make fine adjustments to the laser wavelength,\nmaintaining it exactly at the absorption feature.\nThe signal photodiode is demodulated at 6 and 12kHz. The 6kHz demodulated\nsignal is dominated by the offset corresponding to the linear dependence of laser power\non drive current and acts as an accurate measure of the received laser power indepen-\ndent of any residual sensitivity to sunlight or other thermal sources. A lower limit is set\nupon this detected laser power such that below a certain threshold the software gives\na \u201clow-light\u201d warning. The 12kHz demodulated signal gives a measure of the methane\ngas within the line of sight of the instrument. The normalised gas concentration reading\nis obtained from the ratio of the 12kHz to the 6kHz signal.\nThe whole instrument is under micro-processor control in the form of a board level\npersonal computer (NS Geode 300MHz), operating under Windows XP Professional\nand running control software written within the LabVIEW programming environment.\nUpon power-up, the computer auto boots and launches the control software. The con-\ntrol software maintains all aspects of instrument operation, including start-up sequence,\nlocking the laser wavelength to the absorption feature, and calculating a gas concentra-\ntion signal which is displayed on a digital readout on the back surface of the optical head.\nThe output stage associated with all these demodulation circuits is set to a time con-\nstant of 10msec, although additional filtering with the control software typical increases\nthis to 300msec - an ideal response time for user interaction. During operation, various\nsignal levels are monitored with respect to confirming laser operation, wavelength lock\nand that there is sufficient backscattered light to make an accurate reading. Failure in\nany of these aspects results in a specific error-code on the gas reading display. Figure 4\nshows a flow diagram of the software control program.\n4.

Figure 5 shows typical traces obtained for the\ndemodulated signals on the reference channel. Figure 6 shows typical traces from the\ndemodulated waveforms from the signal photodiode.\nThose signals obtained from the reference photodiode are independent of gas in\nthe atmosphere and show clearly the characteristic second and third derivative spectra.\nThe signals from the signal photodiode correspond to a received power of 30nW and a\ngas concentration of 1%, confined to a 100mm length of the beam, i.e. 1000ppm.metre.\nThe key parameter in determining the smallest amount of gas that can be measured is\nthe amount of backscattered light reaching the detector. Figure 7 shows a graph of the\nminimum detectable gas concentration (S:N 1:1) as a function of received power. The\ndetection limit scales inversely with the returned light power, indicating that the system\nhas a constant noise floor. This is approximately 2-3 times greater than that predicted\nby the NEP of the detector.\nAn open-path, hand-held laser system... 9\nFigure 7. Minimum detectable gas concentration for a given light level\n5. Field-testing and evaluation of the instrument\nFor outdoor use, the control software is configured to maintain the laser wavelength at\nexactly the absorption feature. The time constant of the demodulation is set to 300ms,\nupdating the gas concentration output about three times per second. A low (< 10nW )\nreceived light level triggers a negative concentration display of -9000 ppm.metre and\na sunlight saturation of the detector as a negative display of -8000 ppm.metre. Most\nof the instrument characterisation was carried out at an open air test site licensed to\nundertake such work.\nThe key comparison is to demonstrate that the optical instrument can give similar\nreading to a FID instrument whilst given the additional advantage of remote sensing.\nUsing a manufactured leak buried at a realistic depth of 80cm beneath the ground we\ninvited a FID user to \u201cpatrol\u201d a defined area, looking for signs of a gas signal. At all\ntimes, standing at a distance of 4 metres, we directed the beam of the laser light from\nthe optical gas detector at the FID inlet. Figure 8 shows the readings from the two types\nof instrument plotted as a function of time. Although not meaningful to compare the\npoint concentration measured by the FID with the integrated over path concentration\nmeasured by the optical instrument directly, we see that the general form of the two\nsignal is extremely similar. A series of field testing by end users have reported similar\nAn open-path, hand-held laser system... 10\nFigure 8. Comparison between a FID and the remote gas detection system\ncomparisons.\nAn open-path, hand-held laser system... 11\n6. Discussion\nThe close equivalence of the reading from the FID and optical instrument suggest that\nthe optical instrument could be used in the field as a direct replacement of the FID\napproach. Furthermore the remote sensing capability of the optical instrument opens\nnew modes of use such that the operator can inspect a location that is difficult to access,\nwhether on grounds of geometry or safety.\nReferences\n[1] HSE Books, A Guide To Gas Safety (Management) Regulations, 1996\n[2] Simpson, 1981, Direct quantitative-analysis using flame ionization detection - the construction and\nperformance of the fidoh detector, J.
