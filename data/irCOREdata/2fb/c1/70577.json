She is a professor of English at\nHunter College of the City University of New York, where in 1987 she became the\nfirst woman to be a Thomas Hunter Professor. So important is she to the\nstudents at Hunter that when they established a women\u2019s poetry centre there,\nthe students named it after Lorde. She has published thirteen volumes of\nwork and in 1974 her book of poetry, From A Land Where Other People\nLive (Lorde, 1973), was nominated for the National Book Award. She is\nalso a lesbian, feminist and activist poet, who dedicates her work to an\nacceptance, understanding and use of difference in the struggle to change\nthe world. Seemingly simple, this work is practically, intellectually and\nemotionally enormous because it involves the creation of new ways of seeing\nand being from within the interstices, the very fabric, of our current\nsocial realities. She is a poet and as such there is both an aural and visual\nquality to all her works including her essays and biomythography, Zami: A New\nSpelling of My Name (Lorde, 1982a). The texture of her writing, the rhythms\nand tones of her voice and the economy, precision, yet multiplicity of meaning\nof her words, are those of the poet. To fully comprehend her, to feel the impact\nof her work, one needs to hear her, if not in the person then to be able to\nconjure up her voice. To hear how she delivers the words that we can see on the\nwritten page.\nHow then is it possible to write in connection with Lorde in the absence of the\nvoice and when, for much of the time, I find her poems beyond the bounds of\nmy comprehension? Surely it is both audacious and partial, and can only lead\nto a one-sided and superficial engagement with her work. Well that might be\nthe case if this were an exercise in literary criticism, but it is not. Rather it is\npart of a longer piece which attempts to critically engage with a small part of\nLorde\u2019s work. Edward Said defines criticism as the task occupying itself \u2018with\nthe intrinsic conditions on which knowledge is made possible\u2019 (Said, 1983:\n182). Clearly this essay is not concerned with this. Rather the impetus comes\nfeminist review 80 2005\n(130\u2013145) \u0001c 2005 Feminist Review. 0141-7789\/05 $30 www.feminist-review.com\n130\nfrom a desire to consider some of the ways in which I, a black lesbian, living in\nLondon, converse with and attempt to use Lorde\u2019s work when I am trying to come\nto grips with things that befuddle or concern me. By engaging with Lorde\u2019s work in\nan effort to develop a greater understanding of the requirements of change, my\narticle is a personal tribute to the importance of the work of this woman. Nothing\nmore or less than this.\nmothering\nIt\u2019s the winter of 1983, seven months after our mother\u2019s death, and my sister, my\ngrandmother and I are in New Jersey to visit my mother\u2019s sister. It\u2019s good to be in\nthe States; even better to be able to talk with my aunt about my mother\u2019s illness\nand death; and great to see my friend from New York. Somehow being in the\ncountry my mother loved so much aids the slow and painful process of waking up to\nboth the reality of her absence and that of her continued and loving presence. My\nintellect does nothing to help me through, my sensibilities do everything, later I\u2019ll\nbe able to make better sense of the Swirl of confused emotions, even the despair.\nFor the moment the need of and comfort from ritual is sharp: a candle in St\nPatrick\u2019s cathedral (much to the incomprehension of my sister and grandmother)\nand a quiet dinner in an Indian restaurant in Brooklyn with my sister, my friend and\nsome of the other women from Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press. Audre Lorde is\none of the women. We say hello and proceed to order; we talk about publishing; the\nstate of racism in the USA and Britain; compare Brooklyn to Brixton; the West\nIndian bakery round the corner to that uptown in Harlem, and proceed to eat.\nAudre plays mother and we all settle, in varying degrees of comfort and ease, under\nher wing.\nThis was the setting in which I first met Audre Lorde, \u2018founding mother of\nBlack feminism\u2019, as a recent radio profile called her (Lorde, 1988), and it is this\nwhich structures my memory of the emotions running through that evening.\nCertainly, memory tells me, there was that curious mix of contradictory feelings\noften directed towards our mothers \u2013 respect, grudging indulgence and\ndeference, irritation and a kind of reticence, as though we were not, for the\ntime being, quite grown up anymore. There is a kind of ambivalence through\nwhich, prism-like, our love is projected and refracted. Perhaps this is in part the\nresult of the scrutiny with which our mothers see us and love us. Because the\nscrutiny of Audre\u2019s perception is a necessary and guiding force for her, she engages\nwith us in the same way as this, carefully watching the speakers as she listens,\nabsorbing and considering the things they are saying, watching their movements as\nif she were \u2018listening\u2019 not just with her ears but with her eyes as well. She once\nremarked that, as a child, her poor vision resulted in light breaking down into its\ncomponent parts, giving her an entry into the colour within light (Lorde, 1988).\nPerhaps it is this which enables her to see the connexions that can lie behind\nGail Lewis feminist review 80 2005 131\ndifference. Certainly it was this poor vision, this physical condition, which led to\nher intense scrutiny of things and people. Her perception is both powerful and a\nlittle frightening.\nHow then should I write of the relevance of Lorde\u2019s work? It feels alien to\nwrite of this. I cannot own it, this concept of being a writer, however momen-\ntarily. The piece makes demands of me. I must work to produce it (my\nmother always knew I was lazy but not a coward), and Lorde would expect \u2013 no,\ndemand \u2013 nothing less than work, than the best of oneself. Like a mother, one\nmight say that she has adopted the concern that we \u2018make the best of ourselves\u2019.\nOnly for her it is a kind of political motto stemming from the belief that it is\nthrough the pursuit of the best of and in oneself that the seeds of change may\nspring.\nFor Audre Lorde is a mother. Not only of that multi-faceted complex of black\nfeminisms (we cannot speak of it in the singular), but also in the sense that she\nhas as her concern the construction of futures. One of the identities she owns and\nuses in the struggle to change the order of things is that of \u2018mother\u2019, and she does\nso in a double sense. One as a \u2018real\u2019 mother of woman and man children. The other\nin a metaphorical sense, as a \u2018mother\u2019 of black lesbians, and feminists, and black\npeople and others of us struggling to own the present. Her aim is that our\nindividual and collective futures may be different and not mere repetitions of the\ncurrent choicelessness. Gods of our own selves is what she would have us be. Ain\u2019t\nthat something.\nBut she does not stop there. In her work she gives us some insight into her view of\nwhat the responsibilities accompanying motherhood are and reminds us that what\nconstitutes motherhood is contested territory, a contest in which the combatants\nare not confined to mothers and children. Rather \u2018motherhood\u2019 is a terrain in which\nthe defining content itself is battled over among mothers themselves:\nI can see your daughter walking down streets of love\nin revelation;\nbut raising her up to be a correct little sister\nis doing your mama\u2019s job all over again,\nAnd who did you make on the edge of Harlem\u2019s winter\nhard and black\nWhile the inside was undetermined\nswirls of color and need\nshifting, remembering\nwere you making another self to rediscover\nin a new house and a new name\nin a new place next to a river of blood\nor were you putting the past together\npooling everything learned\nfeminist review 80 2005 Audre Lorde132\ninto a new and continuous woman\ndivorced\nfrom the old shit we share\nand shared and sharing need not share again?\n(Lorde, 1982b: 56)\nMothers then bear the awesome responsibility of gathering the past into a\npedagogical package, not as a means of controlling but rather as a gift from which\ntheir children may fashion their own visions, their own selves.\nSince then\nI can only distinguish\none thread within running hours\nyou, flowing through selves\ntoward you\n(Lorde, 1982b: 13).\nWhat more beautiful gift for the child, what greater source of joy for the mother?\nListen (as Dylan Thomas says) to the challenge in that. The challenge to those of\nus who are actually mothers; the challenge to the heterosexist order of things\nwhich opposes the categories \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018lesbian\u2019. The challenge to those of us\nwhose political and life experience is older, and maybe wider, to both recognize our\nresponsibility to analyse and pass on the lessons of that experience, and yet to\nwork with and learn from those who follow us. For it is only by doing so that\ntogether we deliver the possibility of self-determined futures. Since we bequeath\nwhat we do today we owe it to ourselves and our inheritors that we leave the best\nthat we can.\nIt has rained for five days\nrunning\nthe world is\na round puddle\nof sunless water\nwhere small islands are only beginning\nto cope\na young boy\nin my garden\nis bailing out water\nfrom his flower patch\nwhen I ask him why\nhe tells me\nyoung seeds that have not seen sun\nforget\nand drown easily\n(Lorde, 1978: 45).\nGail Lewis feminist review 80 2005 133\nWhilst Lorde uses her position as a mother as a metaphor for the responsibilities\nwe have to our collective daughters, nieces, etc., she is also concerned that our\nsons and nephews are not denied their birthrights and have the possibility of self-\ndefinition. In this aspect of her work she challenges black men to take care of\nbusiness and accept their responsibilities towards the younger generations. She\nwrites:\nI wish to raise a Black man who will not be destroyed by, nor settle for, those corruptions\ncalled power by the white fathers who mean his destruction as surely as they mean mine.\nI wish to raise a Black man who will recognise that the legitimate objects of his hostility are\nnot women, but the particulars of a structure that programs him to fear and despise women\nas well as his own Black self.\n(Lorde, 1984: 74)\nAs the mother of her son Lorde tells us that her starting point for achieving\nthis aim is to teach her son to acknowledge, take responsibility for, and\nrespect his own feelings. For when, as an adult, the distance between them\nas man and woman is fully and sharply defined, this lesson will be all he has\nleft of her. It will provide the tools from which he can make his self-\ndefinition without premising that on the subordination and oppression of\nothers. What Lorde is concerned with here is the fact that the difference\nbetween them as woman and man is a socially constructed one. As such it\nrequires conscious action on the part of those who occupy the spaces \u2018mother\u2019\nand \u2018son\u2019 to break down the barriers which, at present, preclude empathetic\nand respectful communication between them. At present a mother\u2019s ability\nto equip her son with an alternative or subversive discourse within which his\nviews of and relations with women are framed is limited. Other black men,\nhowever, can provide a more continuous and sympathetic support system, and it is\nthis work that Lorde challenges them to do. In conversation with James Baldwin,\nLorde asked him how he was meeting his responsibility of speaking to the sons of\nblack America. In response Baldwin did not have much to say, despite his\ntremendous importance as a purveyor of much-needed representations of African\u2013\nAmerican life in the northern states, which spoke to many of us children of the\ndiaspora.\nIn asking this question, Lorde generalized the demand many black feminists have\nbeen making of those men who say they are concerned with turning the world\naround, that they take care of intergenerational business. I am not sure if\nBaldwin\u2019s Evidence of Things Not Seen (Baldwin, 1985) was written before or after\nthat question to him; either way, perhaps this book was in part one indirect way in\nwhich he sought to meet that responsibility. But others have taken up the call. Joe\nBeam, our respected and thanked brother who died in December 1988, consciously\nfeminist review 80 2005 Audre Lorde134\nresponded to her challenge, saying:\nBlack men aren\u2019t any less sexist than other meny and as I look at my writing that\u2019s one of\nmy charges, which she (Lorde) has given me. To speak to other black men as best as I can\nto begin creating a dialogue.\n(Lorde, 1988).\nOf course Joe Beam was an out and progressive gay man and he knew not only that\nhe owed much to black lesbian and heterosexual feminists for being able to be out,\nbut also that he was never going to be liberated while black women, all women,\nwere abused and battered and oppressed within the hierarchy of relations called\nthe status quo.\nLike many of us, Beam was a child of one generation responding to and hoping to\nextend the work begun by earlier ones, so that the next might follow with ever-\nbroadening visions. But the relationship between generations, actual or\nmetaphorical, is contradictory. Certainly relations between parents and children,\nif that is the analogy and identity we are adopting, are unequal, and as a result we\ndo often feel ambivalent towards our parents even when we acknowledge and\nrespect what they have given us. So maybe the use of the identity of \u2018mother\u2019 is\nnot unproblematic, even when it is used in the pursuit of transforming social\nrelations.\nThere are two levels of unease that I have which are at least in part the\nresult of the fact that I am childless and of the age where we resist\npassing over from being \u2018young\u2019, and anyway have no appropriate rite of\npassage to entice us. Such is the time and place. My points follow from each\nother but are not of the same import. The first concerns the extent to\nwhich the adoption of the categories \u2018mother\u2019\/\u2018child\u2019, older\/younger generation,\nare at once exclusive and reified. Let me expand. Despite the tensions,\nambivalences and contradictions within the parent\/child relation there is a\nsuggestion of belongingness, of an \u2018us\u2019 and a \u2018them\u2019, and by extension of\nan \u2018other\u2019 into which \u2018outsiders\u2019, in this case \u2018nonmothers\/nonchildren\u2019,\nfall. Perhaps the use of familial terminology and metaphor has felt\ncomfortable to black people of the diaspora because of our condition in \u2018the\nwest\u2019. Certainly use of such imagery has served as both a sign of community and a\nmobilizer to action: think of the action of black women as \u2018mothers\u2019 in defence of\nthe young of our communities in, for example, antipolicing or education\ncampaigns.\nBut what of those amongst us for whom the label or identity of \u2018mother\u2019,\nactual or symbolic, not only does not fit but excludes from the orbit of political\ndialogue? After all, isn\u2019t it this dialogue that we hope to achieve? The problem\nlies in charting a course between stultifying and oppressive assumptions\nor homogeneity and the equally debilitating and oppressive ascriptions of\n\u2018otherness\u2019. What concerns me is the extent to which it is possible to chart\nGail Lewis feminist review 80 2005 135\nthis course towards dialogue if one acts according to an identity as \u2018mother\u2019, given\nthat within the relation one is assuming, one is adopting the position of the\npowerful? I mean, hell, there comes a time when \u2018children\u2019 resent being directed by\ntheir \u2018mothers\u2019 and so cannot hear them, no matter what the content of the\nconversation.\nThe second point has to do with the strategic implications which derive\nfrom the first. If we are adopting familial categories which are contradictory\nand unequal, how will we achieve the harmonization of community and class that\nwe need to achieve our aims of freedom? How will we even be able to hear and\nrespect the differences in our visions of freedom and the futures we want if we\nadopt categories as though they themselves were unproblematic? If we want to\ninfluence not only people\u2019s capacity for fulfilment, but also the way that they think\nand act (isn\u2019t that at least a part of what Lorde challenged Baldwin to do?), then\ndon\u2019t we have to subvert and redefine the very identities, which also propel us to\naction, in order that we may constantly move toward ever-broadening visions of\nfreedom?\nA practical example. In Britain over the last fifteen years or so black women have\nbeen organizing as women and feminists to change not just the state of race and\nclass relations, but also the state of gender relations within our various\ncommunities. More and more women have become involved in that process, coming\nfrom various backgrounds and offering a variety of methods and analyses for\naction. Sometimes it has been exciting, at others depressing, but always\nchallenging. Those of us \u2018older\u2019 women \u2013 in the \u2018mother\u2019s\u2019 role \u2013 often refer to a\nwhole other group of women, as diverse as we are, as \u2018younger women coming up\u2019.\nAn ambivalent phrase, with at least a hint of condescension. But what I find the\nmost disturbing in this is that we \u2018older\u2019 women sometimes talk and act as though\nwe expect these \u2018younger\u2019 women to follow exactly in our footsteps, adopting the\nsame concerns and tactics, and if they don\u2019t then we often tend to dismiss their\nconcerns and contributions to black women\u2019s struggle and development in this\ncountry.\nCertainly, after a black women\u2019s forum, organized by Sheba Feminist Publishers\nas part of the 1989 Feminist Book Fortnight, many of the women present,\nwho had been involved in establishing the Organization of Women of African and\nAsian Descent (OWAAD) in the late 1970s, felt an enormous amount of\ndespondency because so much of the discussion was taken up with what they\nconsidered basics, things assumed to have been settled once and for all. Obviously\none does not want to continually go over old ground, but two things seem\nto me to arise from this. One is that it is wrong to see the asking of the same\nquestions as repeat performance, because 1989 is not 1979 and the answers we\ncome up with, collectively, will not be the same. Nor indeed will the process by\nwhich we do so necessarily be the same. The other is that if we do regard\nthe asking of old questions in this way, surely we absolve ourselves of\nfeminist review 80 2005 Audre Lorde136\nany responsibility of examining our past contributions, including the many\nmistakes we made. I believe breaking down the barrier between those of the\nOWAAD generation and women who came after us to be one of the most urgent\npolitical tasks facing black women concerned with questions of gender and\nsexuality. I think using Lorde\u2019s work can help us move in the right direction, but if\nnot examined closely can also help to lock us in an impasse that we seem to have\ncreated.\ndifference and contradiction\nLondon, October 1987 \u2013 The Shaw Theatre is full of black women who have\ncome to hear Audre Lorde. The atmosphere is pregnant with expectancy.\nMany women contribute to the event which has been organized to celebrate\nLorde in aid of Azania. It is a tribute to the work that Lorde and others\nin SISA, Sisterhood in Support of Sisters in South Africa, have been doing in\nsolidarity with sisters in South Africa (Azania). Though focusing on Audre we\ncelebrate the urge to freedom of the people of South Africa, we celebrate ourselves.\nSome of us think of other parts of the globe also \u2013 Sri Lanka, Lebanon and\nPalestine, Guatemala \u2013 but these are not mentioned. Finally Lorde comes on to\nread. She includes her poem \u2018For the Record\u2019 (Lorde, 1986: 63\u201364). It jars. I wonder\nif others feel as I do: that the only equivalence between Eleanor Bumpers and\nIndira Gandhi is the manner of the death, nothing else. But who will question her\nauthority?\nApril 1989, 95 die at Hilisborough. They had wanted to watch football.\nIt was a Saturday \u2013 free time, their time. The media, orchestrated by the\npolice attempt to debase them and their deaths: hooligans, drunk, animals,\nLiverpudlians \u2013 the messages are a scourge on our eyes, our compassion. Later\nthe tables will turn, we will know a little more of the truth, and the\nresurrected humanity of the dead and bereaved will rise to haunt its would-be\nassassins. The portrayal of people as animals to be coralled and penned, of people\nto be despised, invokes images of slavery. So does its refusal. We black people\nknow this. We lesbians and gays know this. That day football died. Liverpool died.\nWe died.\nSubverting and redefining the politics of \u2018difference\u2019 is Lorde\u2019s work. To destroy the\nmission whereby the many are reduced to the one is the thread which binds her\npolitics, aesthetics, love. The recognition of difference is both a means to begin to\nundermine the system that exploits and oppresses, and a mechanism through\nwhich we might come to know and construct our visions. But more than this, for\nLorde a redefined politics of difference is also a strategy for harmonizing, without\nthreat or subordination, the diverse impulses to freedom felt by the oppressed and\nGail Lewis feminist review 80 2005 137\nexploited. In one of the few essays where exploitation in the Marxist sense is\nalluded to she writes:\nInstitutionalised rejection of difference is an absolute necessity in a profit economy which\nneeds outsiders as surplus people. As members of such an economy, we have all been\nprogrammed to respond to the human differences between us with fear and loathing and to\nhandle that difference in one of three ways: ignore it, and if that is not possible, copy it if\nwe think it is dominant, or destroy it if we think it is subordinate. But we have no patterns\nfor relating across our human differences as equals. As a result, those differences have\nbeen misnamed and misused in the service of separation and confusion.\n(Lorde, 1984: 115)\nOne is reminded here of the opposition between capital\u2019s desire for a pool of easily\nsubstitutable and homogeneous labour power and its need to maintain divisions\nbetween the suppliers of that labour power, workers. We are reminded of how,\noutside the \u2018factory\u2019, oppression turns around the loci of dehumanized inferiors,\nconstructed as a hierarchy of oppositions: white\/black, male\/female, hetero-\nsexual\/lesbian\/gay, old\/young, able\/disabled. So, in Lorde\u2019s analysis, just\nas the recognition and acceptance of difference outside the \u2018factory\u2019 becomes\na way of turning that system of \u2018seeing\u2019 around and replacing it with a\nsystem where \u2018human\u2019 difference is joyously embraced, so too inside the \u2018factory\u2019.\nSuch an approach to the use of difference as a means to unity is particularly\npertinent to black people in Britain at the moment. And this not only because, as\nthe identities of \u2018English\u2019 and \u2018British\u2019 crumble, the question of whether we can be\nboth black and \u2018British\u2019 refocuses with particular sharpness. As we carve out black\nBritish identities and forms of expression, we have to deconstruct the old and\nestablished axioms of our various communities about what it means to be\nblack (a struggle not new to the many black lesbians and gays who have been\ntold that it is not possible to be both) just as much as we have to fight over\nthe terrains of the forms and uses of \u2018ethnicity\u2019 and our rights to civil society and\nthe state. To put it in another way, we are putting ourselves both in (i.e.,\n\u2018Britishness\u2019) and out (i.e., \u2018Blackness\u2019) of the picture as it has been traditionally\ndrawn. We are subverting accepted notions of both what it means to be British and\nblack and redefining the agenda and terrain of black struggle. To paraphrase\nLorde, who argues the sentiment in terms of restricting notions of sisterhood, we\nare moving beyond the pretence of a homogeneity of experience, a notion of\nblackness that does not exist, whilst simultaneously subverting and refusing the\nlabel of \u2018other\u2019.\nFor black women in Britain, and especially for black lesbians, this task is both\nenormous and vital if we are to be able to construct our lives without fear. It is not\neasy and often it is lonely, for we have to place ourselves within the\norbit of concentric circles, unsure which way the forces will pull, and it is tiring.\nMore than this we have to try to do it without giving any ammunition to the power\nfeminist review 80 2005 Audre Lorde138\nstructure which would have us fight with our own, that would tell us that\nHillsborough is not to do with us, and immigration and racism not to do with\nHillsborough.\nIn this Lorde is a source of direction and a source of strength. Moreover she has\nwarned of the costs of silence. She also knows that the task is not simple\nbecause the ideological and material hierarchy of dominant\/subordinate\nhas eaten its way into the fabric of consciousness held and manifested by the\nexploited and oppressed. She has described the consequences of our acceptance of\nthe vision of the world given by the powers that be. She has warned us that\nacceptance of this vision results in us extinguishing the urge to freedom under the\ndelusion of our security in the power system. The essay and speeches in Sister\nOutsider (1984) are all about this, so are many of her poems. Here is one\nillustration:\nDown Wall Street\nthe students marched for peace\nAbove, construction workers looking on remembered\nhow it was for them in the old days\nbefore their closed shop white security\nand daddy pays the bills\nso they climbed down the girders\nand taught their sons a lesson\ncalled Marx as a victim of the generation gap\ncalled I grew up the hard way so will you\ncalled\nthe limits of sentimental vision.\nWhen the passion play was over\nand the dust had cleared on Wall Street\n500 Union workers together with police\nhad mopped up Foley Square\nwith 2000 of their striking sons who broke and ran\nbefore their fathers chains.\nLook here Karl Marx\nthe apocalyptic vision of amerika!\nWorkers rise and win\nand have not lost their chains\nbut swing them\nside by side with the billyciubs in blue\nsecuring Wall Street\nagainst the striking students.\n(Lorde, 1982b: 85\u201386)\nGail Lewis feminist review 80 2005 139\nSo in equipping ourselves to transcend the history and experience of division, a\npolitics of difference is an essential tool. But sometimes the pain has\ndulled our sense of self so much that it makes it impossible to respond to the\nsuffering and brutality experienced by others. Why didn\u2019t we black people,\nlesbians, gays, women, rise up as of one voice and condemn the attempt\nby the police and others to rewrite and justify the tactics used at Hillsborough\nwhen it led to so many deaths? Why didn\u2019t football fans rise up and condemn\nthe attacks made during the European cup last year in Germany on black, Arab\nand Turkish people by some of the English who said they were fans? How\ndo we forgive those whom we hold responsible for the pain and turmoil that\nbloodies our collective histories, so that we can move across the divides and grieve\nat another\u2019s pain and loss, in order that we can act in future to prevent repeat\nperformances?\nThis vexed and tortuous question is one that Lorde addresses in what is\nperhaps one of her most profound and beautifully constructed pieces of work \u2013 the\npoem \u2018Afterimages\u2019. The poem is centred around two events which take place\nin Jackson, Mississippi, \u2013 the lynching of Emmett Till and, twenty-four years\nlater, the despair of a white woman at the destruction of her home by the flooding\nof a river. In this poem Lorde forcefully reminds us that past atrocities imposed\non one people by another lead to enduring destruction. She recreates the\natmosphere of terror produced by the media images of Till\u2019s murder, veiled\nwarnings to black people that any one of us is a potential lynching victim\nif we dare to \u2018step out of line\u2019. But more than this \u2013 and this is where the power of\nthe poem lies \u2013 she describes the difficulty she has in transcending the memory of\npain in order to be able to meet another woman in her time of loss and\ndestruction. Like most of her poems it is not easy to grasp at first, but as one\ngains entry into it, its force and the horrors of its implications hit you fully. It is a\nlong poem and needs to be read in its entirety, but the first verse conveys much of\nits overall sentiment.\nHowever the image enters\nits force remains within\nmy eyes\nrockstrewn caves where dragonfish evolve\nwild for life, relentless and acquisitive\nlearning to survive\nwhere there is no food\nmy eyes are always hungry\nand remembering\nhowever the image enters\nits force remains.\nA white woman stands bereft and empty\na black boy hacked into murderous lesson\nfeminist review 80 2005 Audre Lorde140\nrecalled in me forever\nlike a lurch of earth on the edge of sleep\netched into my visions\nfood for dragonfish that learn\nto live upon whatever they must eat\nfused images beneath my pain.\n(Lorde, 1982b: 102\u2013105)\nClearly then, Lorde\u2019s work, the questions she asks, are useful resources in our\nstruggle to rise to the task of creating our humanity and to find unity in\ndifference. This struggle is as much about a refutation of essentialism as it is\nagainst enforced homogeneity. In this respect I find difficulties in her work. In part\nthis springs from her notion of \u2018human\u2019 difference. Because just as our differences\n(whether used against us or by us, on their terms or ours) are socially constructed,\nso I believe is our \u2018humanity\u2019. Perhaps the only \u2018essential\u2019 element which we all\nshare is that we do indeed construct our humanity, which is why it is diverse and,\nthank God(!), subject to alteration. Our selves are constructed out of our quest for\nhumanity.\nIn contrast to this way of looking at things, Lorde talks of \u2018the human differences\nbetween us\u2019, \u2018our human differences as equals\u2019, or the \u2018effects upon human\nbehaviour and expectation\u2019, as though what constitutes \u2018human\u2019 is a given, is\nunproblematic. But just as some of us believe (following Foucault) that there is no\nprior existence of sexuality outside the social matrix within which we practice our\nsexual relationships, the same may be true of our humanness. That is, that one of\nthe forms in which we enact or construct our humanity is through the production\nand reproduction of differences. To say this is to suggest that we come to terms\nwith and use differences amongst us not to reveal human essences once the layers\nof oppression have been lifted, but in order to construct visions of what our\nhumanities might become. If, as a collectivity, black people in Britain respond to\nthe slander of the Hillsborough people with a ringing condemnation of the\nslanderers, in spite of the racism of some of the terraces, in spite of the terror\nthat some of those who went to Germany last year imposed on black people, are we\nnot constructing our humanity rather than expressing it? When any group takes up\nthe fight of those deemed to be \u2018not us\u2019, do they not do the same? It may be that\nsuch responses are mobilized by a recognition of the connections which arise from\nthe fact that many of us are different from \u2018the mythical norm\u2019 (Lorde, 1984: 116),\nbut that mobilization is not an indication of an essential humanity. In the end love\nand security are just as constructed as hate and fear. People then, in all the\ndiverse forms of humanity, have to be historicized, socialized and politicized, and\nthis is a process not an essence.\nLorde is at times aware of this, as her frequent criticism of white feminists who\nbelieve that their experience and analysis is the one which is constitutive of\nGail Lewis feminist review 80 2005 141\n\u2018womanhood\u2019 shows. But in her critique she stops just short of challenging the\ncategory \u2018woman\u2019, and suggests that all that is needed is for \u2018woman\u2019 to be\nracialized (or for that matter \u2018black\u2019 to be gendered) and sexualized along a\ncontinuum of sexual orientations. Of course this limitation is, I think, something\nthat many of us black feminists, on both sides of the Atlantic, have shared. The\ntime has come for us to try and move beyond it. In Lorde\u2019s schema the category\n\u2018woman\u2019 will simply be given greater depth and breadth \u2013 but it will not be\ndeconstructed and redefined. The agenda will not be radically reconstituted. This\nquote from \u2018 \u2018\u2018Age, Race, Class, and Sex.\u2019\u2019 Women Redefining Difference\u2019, shows\nwhat I am talking about:\nAs white women ignore their built-in privilege of whiteness and define woman in terms of\ntheir own experience alone, then women of color become \u2018other\u2019, the outsider whose\nexperience and tradition is too \u2018alien\u2019 to comprehend. An example of this is the signal\nabsence of the experience of women of color as a resource for women\u2019s studies courses.y.\nThis is a very complex question, but I believe one of the reasons white women have such\ndifficulty reading Black women\u2019s work is because of their reluctance to see Black women as\nwomen and different from themselves. To examine Black women\u2019s literature effectively\nrequires that we be seen as whole people in our actual complexities \u2013 as individuals, as\nwomen, as human \u2013 rather than as one of those problematic but familiar stereotypes\nprovided in this society in place of genuine images of Black women.\n(Lorde, 1984: 117\u2013118)\nPerhaps my point becomes a little clearer if we concentrate on her reference to\n\u2018genuine images of Black women\u2019. For surely the question is begged as to what such\nimages would be. Images of black women cleaners, nurses or conductresses?\nMilitant black women confronting fascists and racists? Black lesbians sporting\nsome of the more problematic SM regalia such as slave\/mistress? Battered black\nwomen? Black mother, girls, academics? Exactly what is a \u2018genuine image\u2019 and,\nbeyond anatomical constants, how do these relate to the construction of\ndiverse and self-defined womanhoods? It is these questions which are raised\nmore than addressed in much of Lorde\u2019s work and it is these questions\nwhich I feel are as central to our struggle for self-defined humanity as is the\nstruggle against racism, exploitation, women\u2019s oppression, homophobia and\nheterosexism.\nQuestions such as these not only help to move us away from essentialism, but also\nforce us to stop seeing all women as somehow equivalent in their position in the\nworld, They urge us to consider how we decide and measure the relationships\nbetween women whilst simultaneously refusing to use methods commensurate with\nthe existing power structure. Yet Lorde, despite her exploration of the tenacity of\ndivision in \u2018AfterImages\u2019, often fails to distinguish between women who occupy very\ndifferent and opposing positions within the power structure. This is why the poem\n\u2018For the Record\u2019 jarred so when I heard Audre read it that October afternoon in\nLondon.\nfeminist review 80 2005 Audre Lorde142\nCall out the colored girls\nand the ones who call themselves Black\nand the ones who hate the word nigger\nand the ones who are very pale\nWho will count the big fleshy women\nthe grandmother weighing 22 stone\nwith the rusty braids\nand a gap-toothed scowl\nwho wasn\u2019t afraid of Armageddon\nthe first shotgun blast tore her right arm off\nthe one with the butcher knife\nthe second blew out her heart\nthrough the back of her chest\nand I am going to keep writing it down\nhow they carried her body out of the house\ndress torn up around her waist\nuncovered\npast tenants and the neighborhood children\na mountain of Black Woman\nand l am going to keep telling this\nif it kills me\nand it might in ways l am\nlearning\nThe next day Indira Gandhi\nwas shot down in her garden\nand I wonder what these two 67-year-old\ncolored girls\nare saying to each other now\nplanning their return\nand they weren\u2019t even\nsisters.\n(Lorde, 1986: 63\u201364)\nI do not believe we are in the business of making equivalences between people\nbecause they share the same sex, are both \u2018colored\u2019, and the manner of their\ndeath is similar. Rather we need to be looking for a common interest in\nundermining systems of oppression and exploitation. Yet Lorde, in refusing to allow\nthe memory of Eleanor Bumpers to be lost, seems to be saying that the murder, sex\nand colour of these two women mean they should occupy a similar place in a\npopular, self-defined and progressive women\u2019s history. But surely the only thing\nwhich these women did have in common was a shared biology and death. Nothing\nGail Lewis feminist review 80 2005 143\nelse. One was a poor and dispossessed black woman, subjected to institutionalized\nhumiliation and marginalization. The other, in stark contrast, was the head of the\nworld\u2019s tenth industrial power and was responsible for the dispossession,\nhumiliation and marginalization of millions of Indian Eleanor Bumpers.\nGandhi\u2019s introduction of a state of emergency led to conditions similar to those\ncurrently prevailing under the South African state of emergency. The rights of\nworkers and peasants to organize were suspended, fundamentalist movements\nwere encouraged at the expense of democratic movements, and the Indian\neconomy was further opened up to US investment and control. In addition to this\nwe should never forget that Indira Gandhi was in power when the programme of\nenforced sterilization was introduced in the 1970s in which ten million women and\nmen were sterilized. Gandhi may have been martyred by her death but this does not\nnegate the fact she was an enemy of the Eleanor Bumpers of this world. That both\nwere murdered does not make them socially equivalent. Those of us who wish to\nurge the move towards freedom along, to make the conditions for self-definition\nand control possible, cannot be in the business of applauding, however subtly or\nindirectly, women who because of their own place in the power structure, stand\nagainst us in this.\nDespite tendencies to essentialism, Audre Lorde offers much to progressive\nfeminism, to the struggle for black liberation, and to the general struggle to create\na world where difference does not mean subordination, and where the need to eat\ndoes not mean exploitation. She offers us her vision of a new world and of at least\nsome of the elements that need to be considered to achieve it. She also challenges\nus to use her work to push forward in our visions of what we want to be. She\nchallenges us to act, which will include arguing the point, standing up to be\ncounted. But perhaps more important than any of this, she offers us her work as an\nout and proud black lesbian so that in those moments when we think we are alone,\nwe can know that there is at least one other. Another who dared, and who survived,\nand who created.\nauthor biography\nGail Lewis is thirty-eight, lives in London and has been involved in black and\nfeminist politics for many years.\nreferences\nBaldwin, J.
