The first is the seemingly conflicting imperatives of \ndeveloping a high growth, globally competitive economy with fuller employment,  which is \nsometimes and arguably wrongly juxtaposed with the socio- political imperative of redressing \npast structural inequalities in access to skilled, professional and managerial positions as well as \nownership. The first development is the related influence of globalisation and multinational \ncorporations (MNCs), information technology and increased competition which have become \nvery prominent in post-apartheid SA.  South Africa has a dual labour market with a well \ndeveloped formal sector employing some 8.5 million workers in standard or typical work and a \ngrowing informal labour market.  In the case of the formal, knowledge economy, the World \nWide Web and increasing communications that the web has made possible, has influenced \nchanges at organisational level. These and changing patterns of employment are having \ndramatic impact on HR policies within organisations. In a knowledge economy organisation \nrely on knowledge that is embedded deeply in the individual and collective sub-conscious. It is \nthe property of an individual and cannot be taken away from them (Harrison & Kessels, 2004). \nThey would agree to put it in service of the collective whole known as organisational \ncitizenship behaviours (OCBs). In technology driven advanced firms in SA, there are several \nthemes among the various models of citizenship behaviour: helping behaviour, sportsmanship, \norganizational loyalty, organizational compliance, initiative, civic virtue, and self development \n(Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Paine & Bachrach, 2000).  Many of these themes overlap with the \ncommon competencies demanded by advanced MNC firms.  Thus OCBs rest upon a \nrecognition of mutuality of interest and of responsibility between the organisation and the \nindividuals. Increasing globalization and world-wide competition, and knowledge economy \nhas its greatest impact on business strategies, process and practice involving, among others, \nmanagement of human resources. In this paper we examine factors influencing the \nmanagement of human resources in SA and their impact on human resource practices in \norganisations.  \n \nWe begin with the contextual factors in the first part, including description and analysis of the \nGDP, ethnically diverse population, employment\/unemployment followed by major \nstockholders (employers, unions and government) in new (since 1994) SA. In the second part,  \nwe outline and discuss the theoretical perspectives regarding human resource management  and \nmultinational companies in SA. This is followed, in the third part, on emerging trends in the \nlabour market and the discriminatory legacy of apartheid, HIV\/AIDS etc. This includes  \nemployment relations and legislative developments, (especially post-apartheid) such as the \nLabour Relations Act, the Skills Development & the Employment Equity Act as well as the \n 2 \nBroad-Based Black Economic Empowerment and their impact on human resource policies,  \nmanaging diversity and changing managerial styles. The final section contains our conclusions \nand implications. \n \nContextual background \n \nSouth Africa attracts over 60% of foreign direct investment to the African continent.  It has a \npopulation of almost 47 million (SA Statistics, 2005) and in 2003 a gross domestic product \n(GDP) of 160.1 (US $ billion, South Africa, 2004).  GDP growth for the for 2003 was 1.9 \npercent and past three years has been around 3%, slightly above the global average (South \nAfrica, 2004). This year\u201fs (2005) GDP is expected to rise from 4.5 to 5 percent and for the next \nthree years to 6 percent (Joffe, August. 23, 2005; Shezi, August. 23, 2005). As a matter of fact, \naccording to the Reserve Bank, GDP reached 5% in the second quarter of 2005 and the \neconomy is on course to achieve 6% economic growth by 2010 (Mde and Ensor, Business Day, \nOctober. 13, 2005).  Inflation has been below 10% for the past 6 years. In 2003, average \nconsumer price inflation, was 7.9 percent (South Africa, 2004) and for July 2005, it was 3.4% \n(SA Statistics). The South African Reserve Bank (June 2005) suggests that the inflation rate \n(CPIX) will amount to an annualized rate of 4% in the first quarter of 2005:P19). Mboweni, \nGovernor of the Reserve Bank in South Africa, forecasts that inflation will peak at 5.25 % early \nnext year.   The Sunday Times, (Twine, 2005) carried a banner headline \u201cSA\u201fs wealth \nexplosion-number of dollar millionaires skyrockets to 37 000 from 25 000 in 2002. Twine \n(2005) suggests that rise in the value of Rand since 2002 had largely created the \u201eexplosion\u201f. \nVirtually every week the papers also carry reports of mouth-watering empowerment deals. \nSimilarly, the Financial Mail (2005) indicated that African share of high income exceeding R \n30 000 per month had risen from 25 percent in 2001 to 31 percent in 2004, with a growth rate of \nnearly 13 percent per annum. Similarly, the African share of middle incomes between R 10 000 \nand R 30 000 per month was presented at 42 per cent, compared with 44 percent for whites. The \nsource of the information, according to this article, was the Labour Force Survey and an Old \nMutual Insurance team analysis. At the same time, the media also carried stories of abject \npoverty and deprivation deepening, largely as a consequence of unemployment and HIV\/AIDS \nand also due to globalization resulting in retrenchments in industries such as clothing and \ntextiles. However, Schlemmer (2005) suggests that \u201cclass breakdowns and associated trends \nare far more complex than the media hype allows for. Africans are making progress but it is \nslower than most people think...The good news is that deep poverty is not increasing as many \npeople fear. ..The extension of social grants has indeed stopped the socio-economic rot at the \nlower levels of livelihood.\u201d        \n \nFormally employed people in 2003 were 8,373, 761 in the labour force (in the formal sector); \nMNCs employ between 10-15 %. The labour force in the formal sector consisted of almost \n60% Africans, 15% Coloured, 5% Indian and 22% White. (SA Statistics and 2003 annual \nEmployment Equity (EE) report).  There has been an increase in the nature and characteristics \nof the informal economy in developing countries. This has been driven by increase in size, in \nabsolute terms, of the informal economy, and by the increasingly important role that informal \nactivity can play in the generation of income-earning opportunities in developing countries. In \nSA, the participants in the informal economy has increased from 1.9 million in 1992 to 3.5 \nmillion in 2002, an increase of roughly 84 percent.  The increase in informal activity should be \nseen against the background of declining labour force absorption rate of the formal \neconomy-from 82.1 percent in 1981 to 38.2 percent in 2002 and the exceptionally high level of \nunemployment. According to the labour force survey (SA Statistics 2004). it is estimated that \nunemployment ranges between the strict definition estimate of 27.8 percent and an expanded \n 3 \ndefinition estimate of 41.2 percent. From 1994 to 2002, the size of the informal economy \nranged between 7.2 and 8.4 percent.  A unidirectional causality ran from informal economy \nGDP1 to GDP, implying that causality ran one way from GDP1 to GDP and not the other way. \nThis could indicate that an increase in the size of the informal economy contributed to the \nincrease in GDP in SA from 1994-2002 (Saunders & Loots, 2005).  \n \nThere is a rapidly growing informal and casual worker sector, this especially following \nlarge-scale retrenchments in industries such as mining, clothing and textiles. Cheap Chinese \nimports in the latter sector\u201fs have lead to a serious economic crisis with more than 70 000 jobs \nlost in the past three years..  Historically, the economy was dependent on the mining industry, \nincluding gold, coal and other minerals. Over the past decade the GDP contribution of these \nsectors declined to under 35% as industrial and export strategies in the auto assembly, \nmanufacturing and agriculture sectors were aggressively pursued. Although SA has made a \nrelatively successful transition from a resource based economy to a manufacturing and export \noriented model, it has not created significant formal employment (Fraser 2002), although the \npost-apartheid open economy saw significant growth in the tourism and hospitality industries. \nWhilst the economic fundamentals of macro-economic policy appear sound, high \nunemployment persists.  Unemployment ranges between the strict definition estimate of 27.8 \npercent and an expanded definition estimate of 41.2 percent (SA Statistics .2005).  \n \nAs noted earlier, SA remains a highly unequal society, with nearly two-thirds of its labour force \nearning less than US$ 250 per month, due to the country\u201fs legacy of discriminatory access to \neducation, the skilled jobs in the labour market and the ownership of stock and assets. \nAccording to the UN Development programme\u201fs Human Development Report, two-thirds of \ntotal income is concentrated in the hands of the richest 20% of the population, leaving the poor \nwith a mere 2% (South Africa, 2004, page 23). Crime and an HIV\/AIDS epidemic are pressing \nsocial problems for organizational and HRM policy choices. Estimated shrinkage from year \n2002 to 2015 of real GDP owing to AIDS, ranges from 2.8 to 9.6 percent (ABSA Bank and \nING Barings 2002).   \n  \nSouth Africa is an ethnically diverse society. English, Xhosa, Zulu, Sotho and Afrikaans are \nthe most widely spoken languages. Black people (Africans, Coloured people and Indians) \ncomprise over 75% of the population. Since its establishment as a trading post by the Dutch \nEast India Company in 1652, SA had colonial governments from Britain and the Dutch \n(Afrikaaner) settlers. Racial discrimination and wars for control over territories and land were a \nfeature of SA\u201fs history for over two centuries.  Apartheid was formally instituted as a political \nsystem by the Nationalist party in 1948, and abandoned in 1994 with the country\u201fs first \ndemocratic election, after decades of a continuing political struggle by the African majority \nand its representative parties such as the African National Congress. The latter and other \nopposition groups had been banned from the 1960\u201fs until the release from prison of Nelson \nMandela and other political prisoners in 1990.      \n \nThe industrialisation of SA began with the discovery of gold and diamonds at the end of the \n19\nth\n century. Preference for skilled and managerial work was given to white workers, who were \ngiven trade union and collective bargaining rights by the Industrial Conciliation Act (1924). \nAfrican workers were excluded from these rights until 1980. Access to training and skilled \nwork was denied to Africans. The legacy of institutionalised workplace discrimination has \nmeant that organisations in the \u201enew South Africa\u201f now have to develop a skilled and \nproductive work force which was under utilized, poorly trained and alienated from \n 4 \nperformance improvement and competitiveness goals. This is a vital challenge for human \nresource management today.    \n \nMajor stakeholders in HRM and labour relations are represented in the tripartite National \nEconomic   Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). Employers may belong to employer \norganisations represented nationally by bodies such as the SA Chamber of Business. Trade \nunions belong to union federations such as the Congress of South African Trade Unions \n(COSATU) with some 3 million members in its affiliates. Nedlac is an important statutory \nbody aiming to foster a social partnership amongst organised business, labour and the State \nthrough joint consensus seeking on national labour market policy issues and proposed labour \nlegislation such as skills development, employment equity and labour relations laws. Nedlac \nalso has a chamber where small business can be represented as an interest group. Many human \nresource practitioners are members of a professional association, the Institute for People \nManagement (IPM), which together with the SA Board for Personnel Practice (SABPP), seeks \nto enhance the professional standing of the HR profession by providing professional \naccreditation and standards of ethical and professional conduct. The IPM provides an \neducational function running seminars, diploma and advanced programmes and disseminating \nrelevant information through newsletters to members. The SABPP is accredited with the \nnational skills and qualification authority and has played a key role in the formation of this \nbody. The IPM has its own HR magazine, People Dynamics aimed at practitioners. It hosts a \nlarge annual conference with local and international experts as speakers. Many industrial \nrelations specialists belong to the Industrial Relations Association of SA (IRASA), an affiliate \nof the International Industrial Relations Association (IIRA) based at the ILO in Geneva. \n \nTheoretical perspectives: human resources and multinational companies in South Africa \n \nThe global-local debate concerns how MNCs can or should balance the pressures to develop \nglobally standardized policies with the pressures to be responsive to the peculiarities of the \nlocal context (Edwards and Kuruvilla 2005). These authors identify three conceptual \nweaknesses restricting research in this field: (1) inadequate conceptualization of the national \neffects, which results in culture being used as an unsatisfactory \u201ecatch-all\u201f for national \ndifferences, (2) lack of attention to the influence of internal organizational politics, and (3) the \ninternal division of labor within MNCs lacks focus. The global-local policy question arises first \nfrom pressure from uniform or standardized practices globally arises from a legacy of the \nMNCs embeddedness in the original national base; thus the influence of the home national base \nof the firm, particularly the cultural influence, creates a \u201ecountry of origin\u201f; second, and \nconversely MNCs also face pressures that lead them to decentralized decision-making on \nHRM issues to managers in their national context, allowing the firm to respond to national \npeculiarities - the \u201elocal\u201f pressures. This latter pressure towards decentralizing decision- \nmaking on HR issues arises from the need to abide by national-level regulations and \ninstitutions in the labor market (Boxall, 2003). This additionally concerns the link between \nproduction strategies and industrial relations institutions for example where there is \nconsiderable internal diversity within many national economies, particularly marked in large \ncountries. For instance in the USA, a key source of variation is the existence of some \u201cright to \nwork\u201d states in the South, where it may be more difficult for unions to organize; similarly \nwages and working conditions vary considerably between Chinese Provinces and in India.  \nVarious institutional differences in the business environment between northern and southern \nItaly, for example, are well known. Nevertheless, despite some variations by region, the \nnational level is useful as a conceptual tool; national governments play a lead role in \n 5 \ndeveloping the framework of legal regulation of collective bargaining, employment policy and \ntraining provisions with common regulatory requirements across an economy.  \n \nThe continuing relevance of three factors: institutional, industry sector and cultural context \nshows the limitations of the convergence \/divergence debate. This underlines the importance of \nstudying internal firm level work process dynamics and the notion of cross-vergence in the \ndevelopment and implementation of hybrid practices  (Horwitz, Kamoche, and Chew 2002). \nThe notion of convergence is therefore tempered by opposite theoretical constructs of \ndivergence\/particularism relating to country and local context, including cultural variables, \nregulatory environment, labor market attributes, skills supply and level, and industry structure. \nGlobalization creates compelling pressures for homogenization of MNC policy and work \npractices. This process is arguably mitigated by contextual factors with a concomitant need to \nfocus on contingency approaches and mediating variables affecting firm level execution. \nImportance of stakeholder interests such as trade unions, power dynamics within and between \norganizations and the organizational reality of other competing groups need to taken into \naccount. This is particularly important in South Africa. Noting the complexity of research on \ncomparative and international HRM, Budhwar and Sparrow (2002) found both common and \ncountry- specific attributes of HRM.  In South Africa, the nature of domestic labor market is \nimportant , including the degree of voluntarism or regulation of employment practices such as \nfair\/unfair labor practices, recruitment and selection, pay determination, union influence, \nhuman resource development policy and dismissal law. This reinforces an understanding of the \ncomplexity of environmental context. \n \nSouth Africa has experienced a dramatic transformation in the post-aparthied era. Socio-legal \nand political context is particularly important in labor relations, given different regulatory \nsystems, collective bargaining institutions, collective bargaining institutions, relative power of \nstakeholder interests. While these factors are not static or immutable in time, they may impede \nor enable change in a particular cultural and industry context. Trade unions in South Africa \nretain a relatively important influence over the choice and implementation process of HRM \npractices. Labor legislation in South Africa is protective of worker interests in respect of \norganizational rights, collective bargaining and the principle of unfair labor practices such as \narbitrary dismissal and unfair employment discrimination. Statutory institutions, such as \nbargaining councils, the labor court, and the Commission for Conciliation, Meditation and \nArbitration (CCMA), play a prominent role in the conduct of industrial relations. The \nregulatory context is an important mediating variable and co-contributing factor in limiting the \narbitrary introduction of HRM practices by MNCs and enabling hybrid outcomes. Some of the \nSouth African MNCs have introduced productivity measure successfully learnt in the African \ncontext, most of which are adapted from lean manufacturing, TQM and other Japanese \npractices, thus supporting the cross-vergence construct. Thus, while convergence\/divergent \nanalytical framework is important, it can be built on by adding the construct of cross-vergence. \nThis appears to be a more robust way of analyzing the actual nature of the change process in \ncross-cultural adoption of HPWPs, particularly in the type and degree of hybridization which \nappears to occur in the Southern African context and clearly has far- reaching implications for \nthe broader African context. \n \nSome propositions may be helpful in summarizing the above discussion: \n \n1. Firms in a host country with a strong regulatory and institutional framework are \nmore likely to adopt hybrid than other forms of HRM practices \n \n 6 \n2. The greater the internal cultural diversity of the host country, the more likely \nthat hybrid rather than other forms of HRM  will be adopted. \n \nConsiderable research has occurred on the issue of cultural factors in the diffusion of HRM \npractices in MNCs (Debrah and Smith 1999, Jackson 2000, and Kamoche, 1997 & 2000) and \nHorwitz and Smith (1998) have done such work in SA. A facet of this research is a focus on \nintegration\/divergence of work values cross-culturally. The question of cultural influence on \nwork values and HRM practices is important in assessing the extent and type of hybridization, \nwhich occurs in adopting human resource practices, developed elsewhere, and how culture and \nlabour market institutions influence such adoption. Cross-cultural variation in the labour \nmarket and skills supply for addressing market needs, is an important consideration by MNCs \nin the decision regarding foreign direct investment (FDI). South Africa and its regional \neconomy have an oversupply of manual, relatively unskilled workers, and as in many emergent \neconomies, a shortage of technology, financial and managerial skills. The Skills Development \nand Employment Equity Acts have sought to put policy emphasis on human resource \ndevelopment, with levy and grant incentives. \n \nA theme in the literature on MNCs in developing countries is the appropriateness of Western \nmanagement principles and practices. Many authors have challenged the tendency by MNCs as \nwell as local managers to adopt practices with little consideration of the suitability and \nrelevance of such practices. Some have identified the limitations of concepts formulated in the \nWest (Kamoche, 1993, 1997a; Nzelibe, 1986), while others have offered empirical evidence on \nthe nature of extant practices, pointing to their appropriateness or lack thereof (Kamoche, \n2000). The importance of family and community are seen in the network of interrelationships, \nextended family and mutual obligations. This results in a sense of communalism (Nzelibe, \n1986). Some advocate African \u201eubuntu\u201f as a basis for fostering an Afrocentric managerial \nculture with regiocentic HRM practices (Mbigi 2000). The notion of \u201eubuntu\u201f literally \ntranslated, means \u201eI am who I am through others\u201f; this in contrast to the Western tenet of \n\u201ecogito ergo sum\u201f \u2013 \u201eI think therefore I am\u201f. It is this contrasting of a form of communal \nhumanism with individualism and instrumentalism, which has a normative appeal for \nadvocates of an African economic and cultural renaissance, and is posited as having the \npotential to build competitive advantage (Jackson 2000, Mangaliso 2001). But a desired future \nvision may be confused with current empirical reality. The socio-economic context of \nmanagement in SA reflects high unemployment, poverty and illiteracy. At the same time there \nis a high need to develop people and provide a globally competitive economy (Kamoche \n1997b).  \n \nMacro-cultural comparative analyses (Hofstede 1991, Trompenaars 1993) may have adequate \nface validity, but often neglect deeper consideration of diversity within certain contexts and the \npower of organizational culture in MNCs. The latter may act as rival causal factors in the \npropensity to successfully adopt HR practices cross-culturally. This is particularly relevant in \nSA, with its diverse cultural and ethnic fabric, and where research on cross-cultural diversity in \norganizational contexts is embryonic. Hofstede\u201fs original study in 1980 included SA. With its \nsample of only one firm viz. IBM in SA, which was at the time predominantly white in its \nstaffing composition, the study failed to discern the multidimensional nature of even his own \nmodel. Additionally, the longitudinal changes in the employment and staffing structure of SA \norganisations have become more diverse and multicultural at all levels especially since 1994. It \nis likely therefore that constructs such as individualism\/collectivism, risk taking and \navoidance, may show quite varied patterns today.  \n \n 7 \nBooysen (2001) investigated perceptions of national culture among retail banking managers \nfrom three of the largest banks in South Africa.  She found significant differences between \nAfrican and white racial groups on seven of the eight dimensions of national culture examined.  \nThe cultural constellation of the white management group reflected a Eurocentric or Western \norientation that emphasises individual self-sufficiency, competition and work orientation, and \nstructure and planning.  In contrast, the cultural constellation of African managers reflects high \nlevels of collective solidarity, group significance, valuing harmonious interpersonal and group \nrelations, consensual decision making, building trust and reciprocity, nurturing and coaching \n(Mangaliso 2001) and below average levels of assertiveness (Booysen 2001). These latter \nattributes reflect cultural values congruent with Afrocentric management systems. As the \nprofile of executives changes, this will impact too on the evolution of MNC organisational \ncultures in their local (SA) operations.  In contrast, Thomas and Bendixen (2000) found little \nsignificant difference among the 586 managers they sampled using Hofstede's dimensions of \nnational culture model.  Their sample included twenty different race\/ethnic and group groups \nrepresenting the dominant categories of the SA population (e.g. White Afrikaans speaking \nmales and females, Zulu speaking males and females, and Asian males and females).  The \ngroups were similar on power distance, individualism, and long term orientation.  Thomas and \nBendixen (2000) concluded that at the managerial level, there appears to be a common national \nculture among South Africans.  The results of their study indicate a cultural gap between \nmanagement and lower level employees.  Neither study specifically addressed the impact of \nnational culture on human resource management practices.  Nor have there been studies within \nMNC and SA organisations to examine whether or not a strong organisational culture can \nmitigate the effects of national culture. Combined this limited research suggests that a \ncontinuing challenge for the development of high performance human resource management \npractices in SA is how to embrace the reality of the duality of both Western MNC and African \ncultural identities among the workforce.  One sobering conclusion is that there may not be \nuniversally applicable HRM practices for all employee groups.   \n \nHuman resource practices in a country are not only products of national culture and \nenvironment, but organizational culture, diffusion strategy of MNC and local firms and \norganisation structure which in turn influence design, content and implementation of \nperformance oriented HRM practices such as staffing, compensation, HR planning and \ntraining\/development. The debate regarding convergence\/divergence perspectives in the \ncross-cultural diffusion of HRM practices is a somewhat simplistic one. Convergent similarity \nof HRM practices exists largely at the nominal level. Hence, the need to explain  hybrid HRM \npractices, for which the notion of hybridisation or \u201ecrossvergence\u201f seems apt especially in a \nculturally diverse society, such as SA. Contextual factors including national and corporate \nculture, may have a determining effect on design and implementation of  HR practices (Jackson \n2000, and Mbigi 2000). In SA, the nature of the domestic labour market is important, including \nthe degree of voluntarism or regulation of employment practices such as fair\/unfair labour \npractices, recruitment and selection, pay determination, union influence, human resource \ndevelopment policy and dismissal law.  \n \nA key strategic imperative is formulating HR strategies at both national and organisational \nlevels to enhance competitiveness and performance improvement. South Africa\u201fs re-entry into \ncompetitive global markets in the 1990\u201fs created new managerial challenges. One of these \nchallenges is management of human resources in an MNC subsidiary in SA. SA is highly \ndependent on foreign direct investment. It is estimated that there are 1,600 foreign companies \nin SA (Business Monitor International 2003). An MBA thesis the Graduate School of Business, \nUniversity of Cape Town investigated HRM practices in multinational companies in South \n 8 \nAfrica. This research surveyed HR practices in 29 MNCs from Europe, the UK, USA and \nJapan and South Africa. Of the 9 US MNCs, two were joint ventures, three were acquired and \nthe rest were started by the parent company. Four of the companies did both sales\/service and \nmanufacturing, while another two were purely sales \/service and two were manufacturing.  \nFive of all companies were doing business mainly on the local market, while three both locally \nand internationally. Only one stated doing business mainly on the international market. The \ncompanies have been doing business in SA for a period of 8-80 years (average 35 years). \nCompany size ranged from 35 to 1600 employees. Two of the companies had approximately \n8% expatriates amongst the employees, in both cases either the HR director or an HR manager \nwas an expatriate as well. All companies that were involved in manufacturing had labour \nunions. The average unionization of the workforce in the US companies was around 3.59 \npercent.  US and European companies both spend about 50 hours of training on 47% and 41% \nrespectively on their management staff. Worker compensation systems seem to have \nsimilarities in US and Europe. Managers in US, European and SA companies agree on \nperformance related salary. As well, in the US\/UK\/Japanese companies, an employee\u201fs \nseniority is an important factor in determining pay for most jobs. US, European and SA \ncompanies share their financial and\/or performance data with its employees. The authors note, \nwith caution, that the results are based on small sample size, but could also indicate that \nincreasing globalization has resulted in converging HR practices across countries (Grzeschke \nand Moehring,  2004).   \n \nIn both MNCs and local firms human resource practitioners in SA see the most important \nworkplace challenges as performance improvement, employment equity, training and \ndevelopment and managing trade union expectations (Templer & Hofmeyr, 1997).  It is \nestimated that SA organisations spend between 0.5 to 1.5 percent of the payroll on training \ncompared to 5 percent of European, 5,5% of American and 8 percent in Japanese MNCs. The \napartheid legacy in SA created a racial segmentation of the labour market in respect of access \nto higher level technological skills (Barker, 1999), Isaacs (1997) and Standing, Sender & \nWeeks (1996). Training and development are seen by both managers and frontline employees \nin the services industry in SA as vital in addressing the skills gap and developing the capacity \nto meet competitive demands (Browning, 2000). As noted earlier, a feature of macro-economic \npolicy is to attract foreign direct investment and multinational firms, often in joint ventures \nwith local empowerment companies. An important question arises whether the \ninfluence\/power of MNCs is so extensive and penetrative as to override local implementation \nfactors such as the regulatory environment, including legislated employment standards and \ncollective bargaining, and cultural factors. Effective diffusion and integration of HR practices \nwill therefore depend on the relative importance of these factors. The stakeholder perspective \nis relatively well accepted in South Africa\u201fs new democracy. The historical exclusion of key \nstakeholders under apartheid has been replaced by a new emphasis on consultation and \ninvolvement of key groups and individuals, for example in NEDLAC. It includes organised \nbusiness, labour and government departments in formulating industry, and labour market \npolicies. Arguably, the stronger the stakeholder and pluralist perspectives are institutionalised \nin a society, the more likely that \u201ecrossvergent\u201f or hybrid models of MNC and local HRM \npractices will develop. \n \nEmergent trends in the labour market  \n \nAn HRM imperative is to address the discriminatory legacy of apartheid in removing unfair \ndiscrimination in the workplace and enhancing organisational representation of Africans, \nColoured people, Indians and women. Apartheid education and skills legislation created a \n 9 \nrelatively unique basis for skills and earnings inequalities. African access to trades and skilled \nwork was legislatively prohibited by job reservation in favour of white employees in the then \nIndustrial Conciliation Act (1956) and the Mines and Works Act.  These were repealed in 1980 \n\u2013 some twenty years ago, yet African progress into skilled and managerial work has been slow.  \nA new culture of learning and integration rather than reliance only on \u201eaccess and legitimacy \nand discrimination and fairness\u201f perspectives has become necessary to ensure cohesive and \nproductive work group relations in diverse settings (Ely and Thomas 2001). \n \nA structural inequality in the skill profile exists: a shortage of occupationally and managerially \nskilled employees is contrasted with an oversupply of unskilled labour, ill equipped for a \nmodernising economy with increasing knowledge and service sector priorities. South Africa \nhas a rapidly growing and large youth population, which is predominantly African, poor and \nlacking in education and skills (Horwitz, Nkomo, & Rajah, 2004).  This presents a huge \nchallenge to the state, public institutions and private sector. The labour market absorption rate \nfor young entrants, given modest economic growth of 2 to 3.5 percent over the past six years, \nhas been low. Given the lack of relevant skills in market demand fields, coupled with shrinking \nformal core employment, youth unemployment is high. Socio-economic and labour market \nissues remain pressing managerial and business challenges in the post apartheid transitional \neconomy. The government has relaxed legislative provisions on basic conditions of \nemployment to allow greater flexibility for small firms and is encouraging better education and \noccupationally relevant skills through the Skills Development Act (1998). It aims at \nencouraging the provision of opportunities for new labour market entrants to develop skills and \ngain experience for better employment prospects.  \n \nHuman resource development priorities and policy challenges in achieving organisational \nchange and capacity building in the labour market are critical to enhancing SA\u201fs international \ncompetitiveness. In SA, a developing economy, skilled jobs are growing and unskilled jobs are \ndeclining.) Job losses have occurred due to import liberalisation arising from rationalization of \nproduction and downsizing of employment often reflecting inefficiencies and comparatively \nlow productivity and high costs in relation to low wage economies like China (Hayter, 1999 \nand Godfrey, Clarke, Theron and Greenburg (2005). In 1996, South Africa lowered tariffs on \nimported goods significantly and rapidly. As a result after years of protection, the local \nclothing industry is increasingly competing directly with those of other countries. These are \ncountries with much lower labour costs producing clothing intended for lower end of the \nmarket. Products from these countries have also been entering SA illegally through its porous \nborders. Over time, the quantity of clothing beginning at the lower end has spread to the middle \nand upper market segments. Whilst overall employment in the clothing industry may not have \ndeclines as significantly as media reports suggest, closer  investigation shows that formal \nemployment has shrunk considerably and informal employment has increased. Employment \nhas shifted from firms registered with bargaining councils (that is, formal employment) to \nunregistered firms or firms located outside the bargaining council areas resulting in \ndeterioration in employment conditions, social protection and pay. \n \nData on the number of clothing manufacturers in operation, data indicates that the industry is \nlarger than its formal component. Restructuring has also involved a decrease in the average size \nof clothing firms (measured in terms of numbers employed). The data on the number of firms \nand employees makes it clear that a process of informalisation has accompanied downsizing \nand retrenchment in the formal clothing industry. Production has been fragmented and \nrelocated away from established manufacturers to smaller operations, some of which are \nregistered cut, make and trim (CMTs) but many of which are unregistered firms or \n 10 \nhomeworking operations.  China now has an 86% market share of clothing imports into SA \n(Paton and Bisseker (2005). There is a heated national debate regarding the question of \nenhancing labour market flexibility, help for small business and lowering the regulatory cost of \ndoing business.  The labour absorption capacity of the market for youth employment is limited, \nresulting in high youth unemployment or employment in non-standard precarious work. These \ntrends pose serious challenged with regard to compliance with bargaining council agreements \nand other labour standards. Enforcement of these regulations has become much harder. For, \nexample, there has been an increase in the number of non-complaint clothing manufacturers \nand CMTs. This is sometimes referred to as the \u201edomestic sweatshop phenomenon\u201f. Also, in \nareas that were outside of bargaining council agreements, foreign-owned export-oriented firms \nhave proliferated. These firms have not only prevented SACTWU from organizing workers in \nsome factories, but also illegally refused access to Department of Labour (DOL) and \nbargaining council inspectors.    \n \nThe Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) has identified what it refers to as high, \nintermediate and low-skills bands in the SA labour market, with the intermediate skills \neducation and training band having the most severe skills shortage, with  an oversupply of \nunskilled workers especially in informal and casual employment. Intermediate skills band \nshortages include for example artisans, technicians manufacturing operatives (Kraak 2004). \nSupply side provision by educational and training institutions in these skill categories shows a \nworrying decline. Kraak (op cit: 65) argues that a skills crisis in the high level skill-band may \nbe exaggerated and misplaced; this given for example, high unemployment (approximately 1 \nmillion) of young graduates attempting to find their first job. Arguably though, some higher \nlevel qualifications may see an oversupply at the entry level, for example human resource \npractitioners, though others such as actuaries may still be in demand. There is a partial decline \nin the demand for engineers which is mirrored in the decline in the training of engineers on the \nsupply side with a decline in university output of engineers since the mid-1990\u201fs. Positively \nhowever, 45 per cent of new learnerships registered by the Department of Labour are in the \nintermediate band (Kraak op. cit: 79). Steadily rising economic growth predicted to rise to \n5.8-6 percent from 2006 may accelerate the present muted demand. The HSRC argues that SA \nneeds an economic growth trajectory that includes a significant low-skill, labour intensive \nemployment strategy (Kraak op cit: 84 and Ashton (2004). This would not preclude the \nidentification of high performance niche industries requiring high-level skills formation. \nHence multi-faceted policy solutions are needed. Such policy priorities would need to address \nthe declining output of key \u201ehard\u201f technical areas such as engineers and technical operatives.    \n \nAllied to the issues of skills supply and demand, HIV\/AIDS has a disproportionately negative \nimpact on the economically active population, on Africans and women. The impact is projected \nto occur unevenly across companies and sectors, and all skill levels will be negatively affected. \nCapital substitution, poaching and the importation of foreign skilled labour may occur. \nHIV\/AIDS will adversely affect quantity and quality of education; the achievement of equity \ntargets in skills development, education and training may be at risk (Human Resources \nDevelopment Review 2003). Crime and an HIV\/AIDS epidemic are pressing social problems \nfor policy choices. Estimated shrinkage from year 2002 to 2015 of real GDP owing to AIDS, \nranges from 2.8-9.6% (ABSA Bank and ING Barings 2002).  Although not yet viewed by a \nmajority of South African firms as a strategic issue, the rate of HIV\/AIDS in the labour force is \nviewed by some as having the potential to erode productivity gains made through skill \ndevelopment efforts.  According to the Medical Research Council of South Africa about 12-15 \npercent of the population is HIV infected. AIDS has become the single biggest cause of death \n(Dorrington, Bourne, Bradshaw, Laubscher & Timaeus, 2001). Firms in the mining industry \n 11 \nare expected to be hit particularly hard because of the legacy of migrant labour.  Some large \nfirms like Anglo Gold have responded by offering employees access to HIV drugs.   As the \nimpact of the disease becomes more evident, firms may have no choice but to address it has a \nstrategic human resource management challenge. \n \nTempler, Hofmeyr and Rall (1997:551-558) found a preference for developing an African \nmodel of management, with less reliance on American and Japanese MNC approaches. A \ncomparative study found agreement between human resource practitioners in Canada, South \nAfrica and Zimbabwe on the need for flexible work practices and cost effectiveness, but \nsignificant differences in priorities South African practices under apartheid focused on \npersonnel administration and industrial relations. This has shifted to emphasising employment \nequity, performance management and organisational restructuring often resulting in \ndownsizing and retrenchments. The twin challenges of redressing labour market inequalities \ncreated by apartheid and simultaneously and rapidly creating competitive capabilities are \ndaunting, often competing, but unavoidable HRM challenges. The magnitude of these \nchallenges are best understood within their historical and stakeholder context. African \neconomic empowerment has become a priority for the new government as a strategy to break \nthrough the social closure created by past discriminatory policies. Professional, managerial and \ntransport occupations account for an increase of around 2 million jobs since 1970.  More \nskilled employees have been absorbed into service industries, due to a structural shift from the \nprimary sector to growth in services, accompanied by rising capital to labour ratios.  Greatest \ndemand is expected for skills in I.T and finance (Bhorat, 1999). The labour absorption capacity \ninto higher skill and managerial jobs is being nudged by supply-side measures such as \nemployment equity legislation.   \n \nMNC and local firm dimensions of human resource management  \n \nWe have earlier evaluated trends dealing with human resource development, skills training, \nemployment equity and employment relations. Recruitment and selection have become \nimportant focal points for both seeking to attract talent and address equity imperatives. \nMethods for recruitment and selection have come under scrutiny in respect of fair and \nnon-discriminatory practices. Chapter 2 of the Employment Equity Act (1998) makes \nimportant provisions regarding the use of psychometric and HIV testing, which are free of any \ncultural or ethnic bias. Whilst it is good professional practice anyway, this Act requires an \nemployer to conduct a review of recruitment and selection practices and promotion policies to \nensure they do not unfairly discriminate. This has resulted in a more professional approach to \nrecruitment and selection. Recruitment agencies are also required to ensure compliance with \nthe non-discriminatory provisions of legislation. An applicant for a job is included in the \ndefinition of \u201eemployee\u201f in employment equity and other labour laws. This means that a job \ncandidate cannot be discriminated against unfairly on grounds of factors such as race or gender.  \n \nRemuneration policy and practice have become an important function for an employer to \nleverage performance improvement (Horwitz (2000). Especially at executive level, SA firms \nare increasingly applying and adapting best pay practices largely from the US MNCs. There is \na trend towards performance-based pay, with an increased variable component of pay. Basic \npay for executives is declining as a proportion of total package with more use of share options, \nprofit sharing, variable and flexible pay measures. At operational levels and often in \nnegotiation with trade unions, skill-based pay has been introduced. Examples include auto \nassembly, clothing and textiles and various engineering and manufacturing firms.  But in \nsectors such as building and construction, increased labour sub-contracting has resulted in a \n 12 \ndeterioration of conditions of employment for increasing numbers of workers.  Rising earnings \ndifferentials owe in part to these factors and the legacy of an \u201eapartheid pay gap\u201f. It has been \ndifficult to prove that pay differences are exclusively due to racial discrimination, and not other \nfactors such as performance, length of service, and relevant experience, even though there is a \nreverse onus of proof (the employer has to provide a legally valid explanation) in claims of \nunfair discrimination. Human resource departments are concerned with both pay \nadministration and measures to improve performance management through pay incentives. \nIncreasingly the former is being outsourced and\/or replaced with technology as IT and new \nsoftware packages are designed to do pay administration. For more progressive organisations, \nthis will allow HR functions to concentrate on aligning HR policy and measures with \norganisational strategy to optimise performance. \n \nThe use of job evaluation by HR departments in medium and large organisations is common \npractice for establishing the relative worth of jobs and ranking jobs as a basis for designing a \ngrading structure.  Job evaluation systems were introduced in the mining and beer brewing \nindustries in the early 1970\u201fs. Job evaluation systems such as Hay, Peromnes (a widely used \nlocally developed system), Paterson and others are variously used in agri-business, \nengineering, government, insurance and financial services, manufacturing, mining and tertiary \neducational institutions such as universities. As organisations restructure and delayer \nhierarchies, job evaluation systems have to adapt to deal with processes such as broad banding \nand multi-skilling. Job analysis and work process redesign are increasingly important facets of \nHR work in SA. Research shows that although Western MNC HRM practices have prevailed \nfor decades in African countries there is an increase in SA firms adopting Japanese and east \nAsian practices (Horwitz, Kamoche and Chew  2002, and Faull 2000). This is particularly \nevident in the use of Japanese MNC (such as Toyota and Nissan which have assembly plants in \nSA) lean manufacturing, just-in-time methods and other operations management measures to \nreduce product defects, stock holdings, inventory and waste. These measures have also \nincreased in the manufacturing sector where firms have introduced kaizen, kanban methods, \nNissan type green areas, Toyota Total Quality Management (TQM) and production systems \nand quality improvement teams. However, the adoption of east Asian work practices is seen by \nmany as unworkable. Many firms believe that Japanese MNC work philosophies are rooted in a \ndifferent cultural context and cannot therefore be copied in African countries (Keenan \n2000:26). There is case study evidence of forms of functional flexibility in firms such as Pick n \nPay Retailers, SA Nylon Spinners and Sun International Hotels. (Horwitz and Townshend \n1993). However, these practices are less common (under 10 percent) in relation to use of \nnumerical flexibility such as downsizing and outsourcing, and temporal flexibility types such \nas part-time, temporary and casual, short term work (Allen et al 2001). Use of flexible work \npractices, including functional forms of flexibility such as multi-skilling and performance \nbased pay, is more common in MNCs than in local SA firms (Horwitz and Smith, 1998: \n590-606). SA organisations tend to emphasise collective and procedural relations, whereas \nMNC firms in SA have more distinctive often diffused HRM practices based on individual \nrelations.  \n \nEmpirical work in SA on the concept of \u201ceffectiveness\u201d in HRM and industrial relations \npractices has attempted to determine the relationship between these factors and performance \nmeasures such as service (Browning, 1998, Horwitz & Neville, 1996, Templer and Cattaneo, \n1991, and Owens & van der Merwe, 1993). Mediating contextual factors in adoption of HRM \nhave been found in other African countries (Kamoche, 1992). Kamoche (1993) offers a \nprovisional model of HRM in Africa. Considering the notion of \u201ceffectiveness\u201d in HRM and \nindustrial relations, a critical challenge is that of moving from discriminatory practices, \n 13 \nadversarial industrial relations and an under-skilled workforce, towards a fair HRM regime \nwith high performance practices.  Consequently, managing diversity, job design, training and \ndevelopment, and performance management seem to be dominant HRM functional areas \ndriving the agendas of both SA and MNC firms in SA. \n \nEmployment relations and legislative developments  \n \nEmployment relations in SA have undergone major changes over the past two decades (Rajah, \n2000). An adversarial race-based dualistic system evolved following labour legislation in 1924 \nwhich led to trade unions rights which excluded Africans. Only in 1980 were unions \nrepresenting African workers legitimised. Inclusive bargaining councils were fostered through \nthe Labour Relations Act in 1995. African unions grew to over 3 million members in 2001 \nfrom less 10 per cent of the formal sector work force in the late 1970s. The largest unions are \naffiliated to union federations such as the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) \nand the National Council of Unions (NACTU).   \n \nThe Labour Relations Act (1995) also established labour and labour appeal courts, and the \nCommission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). The CCMA handles both \nprocedural and distributive or substantive justice in considering the fairness of a matter such as \ndismissal. The new Act sought to bring employment law in line with the constitution and \nratified Conventions of the International Labour Organisation. It aims to give effect to \nconstitutional rights permitting employees to form unions, to strike for collective bargaining \npurposes, and the right to fair labour practices.  Employers have the right to form and join \nemployers' organisations and the recourse to the lockout for the purpose of collective \nbargaining. Strike action is protected only if a specified dispute procedure is followed. Whist \ncentralised industry level and decentralised enterprise or plant bargaining may occur, increased \ndevolution and fragmentation of bargaining has occurred in the past nine years. The number of \nbargaining councils has declined to less than 80 as employers withdraw from them, favouring \nplant or enterprise bargaining and increased employment flexibility. This has occurred for \nexample in the building and construction industries, as new forms of employment emphasising \nflexibility  using independent sub-contractors, outsourcing, part-time and temporary work and \nincreased casualisation and informalisation of work. These practices are associated with a \nrecent decline in private sector union density and some evidence of deterioration in \nemployment standards in certain sectors. The Basic Conditions of Employment Act (1998) \nhowever, provides for establishing minimum standards of employment. These conditions cover \nareas from the designation of working hours to termination regulations and have been extended \nto farm and domestic workers.  Work days lost through strike action have also declined since \n1994. Whilst under apartheid African unions fought for fair labour practices, worker rights and \nbetter pay and conditions of employment, they also were at the forefront of the struggle for \npolitical rights. Once political and labour rights complemented each other in the first \ndemocratic elections in 1994, this labour paradox was resolved. This resulted in an intense \npolicy debate within the union movement as to its repositioning in the new SA. The work place \nas an arena for political struggle has largely been replaced with an emphasis on measures to try \nand preserve employment and HR issues such as training and development and employment \nequity (Horwitz et al 2004). The Labour Relations Act seeks to promote employee \nparticipation in decision making through workplace forums and employee consultation and \njoint decision making on certain issues.  It provides for simple procedures for the resolution of \nlabour disputes through statutory conciliation and arbitration, and through independent \nalternative dispute resolution services. Amendments to Act came into effect on 1 August 2002.  \nNew forms of dispute resolution were developed to include pre-dismissal arbitration and one \n 14 \nstop dispute resolution known as CON-ARB.  Both unions and management have the power to \nrequest the CCMA to facilitate retrenchment negotiations to achieve constructive outcomes.  \n \nA key challenge in employment relations is the need to shift from a legacy of adversarial \nrelationships to work place co-operation to successfully compete in the market place. There is \nevidence in some sectors such as auto assembly that this is understood by both parties. There is \nincreasingly a blurring of the distinction between employment relations and HRM. The new \nagenda focuses beyond the traditional collective bargaining items and adversarial dismissal \ndisputes, to organisational transformation, performance improvement, human resource \ndevelopment and employee benefits. Trade unions have become more willing to engage \nemployers around these issues. Finding a productive balance between equity and work place \njustice imperatives on the one hand, and HR and employment relations strategies enhancing \ncompetitiveness on the other, is a vital challenge for mangers and unions.  \n \nEmployment equity legislation and human resource practices \n \nLegislative prohibitions against unfair discrimination are intrinsic to SA\u201fs Constitution (1996).  \nChapter 2 (the Bill of Rights) contains an equality clause, which specifies a number of grounds \nwhich constitute unfair discrimination. Additionally, Schedule 7 of the Labour Relations Act \n(1995) considers unfair discrimination either directly or indirectly as a residual unfair labour \npractice.  Grounds include race, gender, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, religion, disability, \nconscience, belief, language and culture. The Employment Equity Act (1998) focuses on unfair \ndiscrimination in employment and HR practices. Employers are required to take steps to end \nunfair discrimination in employment policies and practices. It prohibits the unfair \ndiscrimination against employees including job seekers on any arbitrary grounds including \nrace, gender, pregnancy, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, language and religion. \n \nThe Constitution and prohibitions contained in the Employment Equity Act and other labour \nlegislation, distinguishes permissible discrimination from impermissible discrimination. All \ndesignated employers (these who employ 50 or more people) have to prepare and submit to the \nDepartment of Labour, an employment equity plan setting out goals, targets, timetables and \nmeasures to be taken to remove discriminatory employment practices and achieve greater \nworkforce representation, especially at managerial and skilled category levels.  The \nEmployment Equity Act does not set quotas, but rather enables individual employers to \ndevelop their own HR and equity plans. Criteria regarding enhanced representation include \nnational and regional demographic information and special skills supply\/availability. The \nEmployment Equity Act includes provisions against unfair discrimination in selection and \nrecruitment, aptitude testing, HIV\/AIDS testing, promotions, and access to training and \ndevelopment opportunities. It is generally accepted that an \u201capartheid wage gap\u201d saw pay \ndiscrimination evolve over some four decades or more.  More recent equalisation of \nopportunities has not always led to pay parity for work of equal value.  Section 27 of The \nEmployment Equity Act somewhat controversially requires designated employers, as part of a \nrequired employment equity plan, to submit to the Department of Labour a statement on the \nremuneration and benefits received in each occupational category and level of the employer\u201fs \nworkforce.  Where disproportionate income differentials are reflected in the statement, an \nemployer is required to take measures to progressively reduce such differentials.  Measures \ninclude collective bargaining, skills formation, compliance with other wage regulating \ninstruments and benchmarks set by the Employment Conditions Commission.  \n \n 15 \nAs part of a required employment equity plan, designated employers have to review \nemployment and human resources practices to remove provisions or practices which may have \nan unfair discriminatory effect.  This includes recruitment and selection and remuneration. An \napplicant for a job is included in the definition of \u201eemployee\u201f, making illegal, unfair \ndiscrimination in pre-employment recruitment and selection practices, such as psychometric \nassessment, interviews and application form questions which do not pertain directly to the \nability of the person to do the job. South African labour law allows discrimination on the basis \nof inherent job requirements.  But the object of an employer\u201fs conduct must be fair, and the \nmeans rational. It is in these areas, as well as in the provision of substantive benefits and \nconditions of employment, where unfair discrimination is most likely.  The notions of \ndisproportionate effect and adverse impact are considered in this regard. Once an employee \nclaims discrimination, the evidentiary burden shifts to the employer to show that the \ndiscrimination is not unfair. It is nonetheless very difficult for an employee to prove pay \ndiscrimination conclusively.  In particular, whilst discrimination may occur, an employer may \ncogently submit that pay and skill differences were not the result of unfair discrimination, but \ndue to factors such as differences in performance, experience, competencies and service. \nRecent court cases show that even in an environment where affirmative action to overcome \npast discrimination is accepted as an appropriate method to achieve equity, there are continuing \ndiffering interpretations about its aims and effects on HR practice. Decisions based on race or \ngender, unless they related to a genuine skills or occupational requirement, could be found to \nbe arbitrary and unfair labour practices (Van Vuuren 1998 and Liberty Life 1996 cases).  \nAffirmative action, though, is not regarded as unfair discrimination in SA labour law.  Both the \npolicy and organizational context in which the dispute arises is pertinent This tends to reflect \nthe limitations of the \u201ediscrimination and fairness\u201f as well as \u201eaccess and equal opportunity\u201f \nperspectives as legalistic and procedural remedies to race and ethnic relations problems in the \nwork place. Change management and \u201esoft\u201f HR strategies focussing on relationship building \nand cultural transformation to integrate diversity as a value in itself for effective work group \nrelations, have been found to be more effective than reliance on procedural justice approaches \nalone (Horwitz et al, 2004). \n \nEven when employers explicitly espouse these policies, the consequences of years of \nsystematic discrimination continue to skew both internal and external labour markets. \nManagers\u201f failure to adequately address both skills and pay practices in the service industry in \nSA has a direct adverse impact on service behaviour of frontline employees (Browning, 2000).  \nHuman resource policies and remuneration practices do not occur in a \u201cneutral\u201d or unbiased \ncontext. The institutional environment remains a powerful influence on HRM in SA, mitigated \nto an extent by the competitive forces of global competition.

Semi- and unskilled employees account for 60% of the \nworkforce. White employees are more likely to be part of top management than members of \nother groups, and both Indian and white employees are more likely to be employed at the top to \nmiddle management level. The majority (68%) of African employees are employed at the \nsemi-skilled or unskilled level, and African employees are more likely than other population \ngroups to be employed at the unskilled level (Annual Employment Equity (EE) Report, 2003). \n \nBroad-based Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and Human Resource Management \n \nOne of the strategies used by the SA government to encourage black equity in the economy is \ncalled the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment. It was introduced in the Broad-Based \nBEE Act of 2003. It means the economic empowerment of Blacks including Black women, \npersons with disabilities, and others through diverse but integrated socio-economic strategies \nincluding increasing the number of Blacks who manage, own and control enterprises and \nproductive assets, human resource skills and development, equitable representation in all \noccupational categories and levels in the workforce, preferential procurement and investment \nin enterprises that are owned or managed by Black people. \n \nBroad-based BEE has three components: direct empowerment, human resource development \nand indirect empowerment. The human resource development component\u201fs beneficiaries are \nemployees and workers through employment equity and skills development. Skills \ndevelopment indicates development of core competencies of black people to facilitate their \ninteraction in the mainstream of the economy.  The BBBEE concept has caught on quite \nsignificantly.  Many industrial sectors have set targets through negotiated charters for BEE and \nothers are implementing EE and skills development to an increasing extent. It is almost daily \nnews, (see for instance, Mathews & Cohen, September.30, 2005:1; Rose, September 30, 2005:  \nand Cokayne, \u201cMotor industry BEE task team stalls as it awaits revised scorecard\u201f\u201f September \n30, 2005:1).  According to Navin and Neil (2005) \u201c\u2026the government\u201fs black economic \nempowerment  (BEE) program is beginning to pick up pace and fundamental shift in the \neconomic balance of power could be on its way\u201d. The government and industrial leaders from \nseveral sectors have drawn up industry charters. These charters lay down a series of targets for \nthe proportion of each sector to be controlled by companies mainly owned by black South \nAfricans. For instance, Navin and Neil (2005) indicate that charters have already been \ncompleted for the financial, tourisms; and mining sectors, among others. Standard Bank, \ncountry largest bank, indicated that it would sell a 10% stake to black empowerment interests; \nit already has two prominent blacks on its board of directors. The key targets for the banking \nindustry are to boost the number of black SA board members to 33% by 2008, up from 25% at \npresent; to increase the number of black SA executives from 10% in 2003 to 25% by 2008; and \nto increase procurement from BEE companies from 13% at the end of 2003 to 25% by 2008. \nThe banking and finance sector have also promised to boost black employment at all levels \nfrom 13% at the end of 2003 to 50% by 2008. Additional targets for empowerment are that by \n2008 11% of all board members should be black women and at least 80% of the population \nmust have access to a bank within 20 kilometres of either their home or work place by 2008. A \nstudy commissioned in 2004 by the Businesswomen\u201fs Association (BWA) and Nedbank found \nthat 14.7 percent of executive managers and 7.1 percent of all directors in SA are women;  \nseven or 1.9 percent of CEO\u201fs are women and not a single female chairperson of listed IT \ncompanies in SA (The Top Women, 2005\/6, page 10). Some of the biggest stumbling blocks in \nwomen\u201fs progress as directors and chief executives are a lack of serious mentorship, lack of \n 20 \nopportunity and poor self-esteem (The top Women, 2005\/6, page 46). However, most women \nare employed in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) than in the private sector. In SOEs women \nmake up 34.9 percent as directors and 31.3 percent in executive management positions (The \nTop Women, 2005\/6: 73).   \n \nThe empowerment issue is important for both local and MNC firms. It is a sensitive issue for \nthe latter, who sometimes question the efficacy of what is perceived as \u201egiving away\u201f an \nownership share especially if the MNC is privately owned, or where this is not the practice in \ntheir other international operations. This said, joint ventures in countries like China are \ncommon place, or in other African countries where the State may be a beneficiary. The \nrequirement that BEE should include MNCs is sometimes cited as a barrier to foreign direct \ninvestment in the country. It would appear that government is willing to listen to these \npositions as its policy evolves. MNCs are mostly willing to address the other facets of BEE \ncharters and in some areas such as training and development, are performing better than many \nlocal firms.     \n \nManaging diversity and changing managerial styles \n \nWhile many organisations around the world have implemented managing diversity initiatives \nin response to the growing heterogeneity of the workforce (Nkomo & Cox, 1996), SA \norganisations generally lag in the adoption of such practices.  In a study of the diversity \nmanagement in a sample of SA and MNC firms, Strydom & Erwee (1998) found at the time \nthat the majority were best classified as monolithic companies wherein blacks were expected to \nadopt the culture of the white dominant group.  Hence, most SA organisations and MNCs in the \ncountry are still using what Ely and Thomas (2001) describe as the discrimination and fairness \nparadigm in managing diversity.  Organisations that look at diversity through this lens focus on \nrecruitment and selection of African, Coloured people and Indians and women employees and \ncompliance with provisions of the Employment Equity Act. Such an approach may be \njustifiable given the mandate of employment equity legislation, union demands and the \nhistorical exclusion of Africans and women from certain occupations.  The fairly slow progress \nin achieving employment equity is due to management's emphasis on numerical goals and not \nenough attention to creating organisational cultures and workplaces that value diversity as key \nto competitive advantage. The Report on Employment Equity Registry issued by the \nDepartment of Labour in 2000 cited corporate culture as one of the major barriers to \nemployment equity (Department of Labour, 2000).  Nevertheless, the specific strategies \nadopted by firms to value and manage diversity will have to take into consideration the \nspecificity of the local and historical context.  An example of such an approach is the one taken \nby First National Bank.  Their unique approach was designed to address the dual challenges of \nlow employee morale due to perceptions of racism among black employees and feelings of \nreverse discrimination among white employees and a business need to increase checking \naccount revenues from the growing black urban population.  In addition to cultural diversity \nawareness training, the programme required all managers to spend two days in an African \ntownship to better understand customer needs.  Additionally, the bank institutionalised \nongoing staff gatherings and the use of collective decision making in branches (Sunday Times, \n2002).        \n \nManagerial styles reflect organizational and national cultural patterns. In SA, whilst \nachievement is valued, group and organization conformity is also important. Whilst there is a \npaucity of empirical research on managerial culture in SA firms a masculine dominance is \nevident across ethnic groups (Horwitz 2002:215-217), underlined by individualist values and a \n 21 \nrelatively large power distance between groups based on historical racial and ethnic disparities. \nHowever, an emergent African middle class has begun to occupy decision-making roles. Class \nmobility is likely to have an impact on managerial culture and inform strategic choices about \nappropriate organizational culture, business and HRM practices in SA. Organization and \nnational culture reflect considerable diversity and pluralism. Managerial styles in SA reflect \nboth Anglo-Saxon, Western values based on individualism, meritocracy and an authoritarian \nlegacy of apartheid. These are often rooted in high masculinity cultures (Hofstede 1991). \nHowever, indigenous models struggle to assert themselves in the face of a converging global \nbusiness orthodoxy (Mbigi 2000).  \n \nConclusions and implications \n \nAlthough incremental progress has been made to enhance racial and gender diversity, this  has \nto be supported by coherent human resource development priorities and changes in \norganisational culture. This is vital at both public policy and organisational levels. Rising \nincome inequalities are beginning to cut across racial and ethnic lines. This could create a new \nfault line of inequality. An increased earnings gap has an adverse impact on mainly African \npeople. This, in spite of increasing diversity and the multi-racial character of a growing middle \nclass. The biggest priority must be human resource development and education in skills and \ncompetencies needed in a transitional society. Several sectors need both high and low level \nskills. The former are in the information economy and high value adding occupations, while \nthe latter are in services sectors such as hospitality.   Hybrid forms of HR based on MNC and \nlocal form practices may occur in nomenclature, design, content and implementation \nprocesses. There is some evidence of reverse diffusion. SAB Miller\u201fs (South African \nBreweries owns the US beer company Miller) jointly owned breweries in Poland have \nsuccessfully implemented best operating practices and management know-how on systems, \nprocess and technology based on Japanese practices and its experience in emergent economies.  \nA balance will need to be struck between indigenous responses to past discrimination and the \nclear need for high performance practices.  \n \nThis conclusion is consistent with Aguilera and Dencker (2004) and Child (2002) who note \ndiffering levels of integration across countries, ranging from no integration, to partial \nintegration, to full integration. For example, firms in the US and the UK integrate their \nsubsidiaries to a greater extent than do firms in Japan, Germany and France. Aguilera and \nDencker (2004) in positing a strategic fit framework argue that although at a broad level \npractices such as pay-for-performance systems are common across market economy types, at a \nrefined level there are non-trivial differences that HR has to manage for example a  \ncompensation system in the BP Amoco merger had to be redesigned because they differed \nsignificantly and a new job structure framework were established. Thus, even firms in \ncountries within the same market economic type will experience some degree of localization in \nHRM practices and policies and therefore need to adjust the role of HRM accordingly. \n \nGiven the diverse ethnic demography of SA society, most of the underclass is African.  \nOrganisations including MNCs will need to shift from compliance to a commitment model that \nhas an organisational culture reflecting the notion of ubuntu and capacity building as vital for \nboth competitiveness and equity in the work place. South Africa faces a double transitional \nchallenge \u2013 to redress the historical inequalities by building a democracy based on human \nrights and tolerance, and to simultaneously and speedily develop its human capital capacity to \ncompete in a harsh global economy.  Arguably this is a bigger policy and practical challenge \nthan managerial and executive employment equity, where the focus seems to lie. Skills \n 22 \nformation and entrepreneurial development are vital, especially in a country with huge \ntransitional challenges (Horwitz et al. 2004).  These can be summed up in one word \u2013 \n\u201cdevelopment\u201d. National skills policies have introduced mechanisms such as a 1% of payroll \nlevy to finance human resource development in order to meet national, sector and \norganisational development objectives. Particular sector skills formation through Sector \nTraining Authorities (SETAS) and a national qualifications framework (NQF) (Sparreboom \n2004: 130-131) are encouraged by law. Economic empowerment and employment equity are \nnot possible without human resource development and education as a fundamental national \npriority. Large-scale labour absorption into a shrinking formal labour market is unlikely, given \nthe shift of employment to service and informal, non-core work mainly outside the ambit of \nemployment equity legislation. The priority of practical policy initiatives by government, \nprivate sector firms, labour market institutions such as sector training authorities and \nbargaining councils, must be large scale initiatives to train and retrain for enhancing \nemployability in the changing labour market.   \n \nThis is supported by Gomez and Sanchez (2005) who conclude that human resources can play \na strategic role in building social capital in the process of balancing local and global forces. \nThey argue that HR can be critical in helping MNCs deal with local differences while also \nhelping the company implement practices that are critical for its global strategy and local \ndevelopment needs. Globalization and localization call for different levels of MNC control and \ncoordination of its subsidiaries. One such mechanism used by MNCs concerned with \ncoordination\/integration is the creation of social capital \u2013 the intangible resources embedded in \nthe network of existing company relationships that assist in the accomplishment of necessary \ntasks; it allows MNCs to help bridge the gap between globalization and localization of strategic \npractices. These authors submit that HR practices can create social capital in locally adaptive \nways. Even though practices are bound to differ among countries, strategically speaking, \ncompanies will want to some practice commonalities across their subsidiaries, and more \nspecifically, those practices that are strategically aligned with the organization\u201fs mission. \nCompanies specifically transfer organizational practices that reflect their core competencies \nand espoused corporate values. HR practices are associated with social capital. Practices such \nas human resource development, fair labor practices and standards, equal opportunity and \nemployee empowerment and equitable wage structures and incentive schemes, \ncross-functional team development, performance management systems incentives and other \npractices differentiate firms with high levels of social capital from those with low levels. \nAccording to Gomez and Sanchez (2005) certain of these practices may be more appropriate \nfor certain cultural contexts than for others and in building social capital, MNCs must take into \naccount the cultural and institutional context in which they operate. The same HR practices that \nbuild trust in one country context may fail to do so in another - each HR practice that an MNC \nconsiders implementing should be filtered through a \u201clocalization mesh\u201d that identifies clashes \nwith local values. This analysis, according to the above authors, should allow for modifications \nthat will render the practice culturally fit.  \n                   \nIn South Africa this means that local and MNC firms will need to shift from compliance to a \ncommitment model that has an organisational culture reflecting the notion of ubuntu, social \ncapital and capacity building as vital for both competitiveness and equity in the work place. \nSouth Africa faces a double transitional challenge \u2013 to redress the historical inequalities by \nbuilding a democracy based on human rights and tolerance, and to simultaneously and speedily \ndevelop its human capital capacity to compete in a harsh global economy. \n     \n \n 23 \nReferences \n \nABSA Bank and ING Barings (2002) Special Reports on HIV\/AIDS in Southern Africa, 1-12. \n \nAfrica Monitor (2005) \u201eForecast holds steady\u201f.
