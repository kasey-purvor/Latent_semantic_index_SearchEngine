In 1998 the Government announced a ten-\nyear strategy to tackle drugs misuse in Britain. This strategy, outlined in the paper \u2018Tackling\ndrugs to build a better Britain\u2019 (HM Government, 1998) pledged to double the availability of\ndrug treatment services by 2008. The implementation of this substantial increase in service\nprovision led to a heightened demand for staff in this field. At the same time as announcing\nthis expansion in service provision, the UK government set about developing a series of\nquality standards for drug treatment service providers, the Quality in Alcohol and Drugs\nServices (QuADS; Drugscope, 1999). The 1996 Task Force to Review Standards for Drug\nMisusers highlighted the variable quality of drug treatment services, especially in the areas of\nmanagement systems, monitoring systems and forward planning. QuADS were developed as\na reaction to this review as a set of quality standards against which drug treatment provider\norganisations were expected to audit their organisational practice and determine areas where\nchange was required. Setting standards and specifying good practice was presented as a\nmeans of ensuring that the increased funding was spent effectively. The standards covered\nboth aspects of service provision and the management of service provider organisations,\nincluding the management of their human resources. Organisations bidding to provide\npublicly funded drug treatment services were required to demonstrate that they could meet\nthese standards.\nIn essence, the two developments above are not in conflict. However, for voluntary\norganisations operating in this sector, the particular context in which they found themselves\nmeant that these combined developments raised some major challenges. Recruiting large\nnumbers of additional staff was likely to be challenging for this sector, since it already\nexperienced difficulties attracting and retaining adequate numbers of appropriately qualified\nstaff (Parry, Kelliher, Mills & Tyson, 2005, Wilding, Collis, Lacey & McCullough, 2003).\nVoluntary sector organisations have traditionally not been known for their sophisticated\n4approaches to human resource management (Cunningham, 2001; Zacharias, 2003) and\ntherefore being able to demonstrate that they met the required quality standards was likely to\ninvolve significant adjustment for many of them. Additionally, the so called \u2018contract\nculture\u2019 (Leat, 1993), brought about by the purchaser-provider split in the 1980s, whereby\nvoluntary sector organisations could complete for the provision of publicly funded services,\nmeant that many voluntary sector organisations had been under pressure to reduce labour\ncosts in order to be competitive. In practice, this meant containing wage levels and in many\ncases only offering short-term employment contracts.\nVoluntary sector organisations found themselves in a position where first, in order to gain a\nshare of the expanding provision of publicly funded drug treatment services, they had to\nprofessionalise their approach to management, including human resource management,\nsecond, to respond to increased service provision they had to recruit more staff into a sector\nwhich already experienced recruitment difficulties; and third, achieve all this in an\nenvironment where competition had exerted downward pressure on labour costs. This paper\nexamines how voluntary sector organisations responded to these combined pressures.\nBACKGROUND\nRecent estimates suggest that in the UK about 688,000 people are in paid employment in the\nnot-for-profit sector (NCVO, 2008), representing 2.2% of the UK workforce. The number of\nemployees in the voluntary sector increased by 26% in the ten years from 1996 (NCVO,\n2007). In 2005\/6 the sector had an income in the region of \u00a331 billion and assets worth \u00a386\nbillion. (NCVO, 2008). However, in spite of its growing significance in the economy, it is an\narea which has not been subject to much empirical investigation in the UK (Alatrista &\nArrowsmith, 2004) and although estimates suggest that labour costs represent a significant\nproportion of total costs (Passey et al., 2000; Zacharias, 2003), relatively little is known about\nthe way in which human resources are managed (Akingbola, 2006; Cooke, 2004; Rodwell &\nTeo, 2004; Rondeau & Wagner, 2001).\n5Employment in the third sector in the UK is typically characterised by a number of features\n(Almond & Kendall, 2000). These include the small size of workplaces, a high concentration\nof part-time and temporary staff (temporary employment is twice as prevalent as in the\nprivate sector); a high proportion of women employees; the tendency for staff to have high\nlevel educational qualifications, and a greater proportion of staff of who work unpaid\novertime, than in the economy as a whole (Kendall & Knapp, 1995; Mirvis, 1992).\nFurthermore, pay levels, in comparison with other sectors, have traditionally been low\n(Broad, 2002; McMullen & Schellenberg, 2003).\nThere are a number of specific characteristics that influence the human resource management\nprocess in the not-for-profit sector associated with both the nature of the organisations and\nwith the orientations of the people who work for them (Armstrong, 1992). Given their\ncharitable nature, organisations in this sector are likely to have strong values and these values\nmay influence the way in which people are managed. Such organisations are likely to attract\npeople who at least at some level support the cause of the organisation. Light (2002) presents\nsurvey evidence of a high level of commitment to their organisation\u2019s cause amongst\nemployees of non-profit organisations. Sixty percent indicated that they joined their\norganisations \u2018for the chance to make a difference rather than for salary and benefits\u2019,\nsubstantially higher than comparative figures for the public and private sector workers. This\ncommitment however, may raise challenges for managing employees in this sector\n(Akingbola, 2006; Mann, 2006). It may mean that employees are less concerned with\nextrinsic rewards, because of the existence of intrinsic ones (Zimmeck, 1998). Lloyd (1993)\nuses the term \u2018ethos discount\u2019 to represent the sacrifice that workers in this sector are\nprepared to make for partaking in the charitable ethos. However, it may also mean that\nemployees are more concerned with how the organisation operates, may expect to be involved\nin decision making (Cunningham, 2001; Mann, 2006) and may be resistant to change (Tassie\n6et al., 1996; Billis, 1993). Although in practice the people who work for them may be their\nmost important assets, (Akingbola, 2006), the available evidence on human resource\nmanagement in this sector suggests that it has traditionally lacked a sophisticated approach\n(Lloyd, 1993; Butler & Wilson, 1990). For example, employment tribunal cases have been\nfound to be almost double those in the public and private sectors (Cunningham, 2000). The\nlink between organisational strategy and HRM has also been found to be weak (Akingbola,\n2006). Although, there is evidence to show that the management of human resources has been\nan area of significant change in recent years (Palmer, 2003; Kellock et al, 2001), it would\nseem that people management has traditionally taken a back seat in comparison to the\nmanagement of activities such as fundraising and service delivery (Zacharias, 2003).\nThe changing nature of social policy in the UK during 1980s and 1990s has affected the\noverall way in which the not-for-profit sector is managed (Harris, 2001). The move to a so-\ncalled \u2018mixed economy of care\u2019 offered voluntary sector organisations the opportunity to\nparticipate in the provision of publicly funded services. Greater involvement in the provision\nof public sector services (recent evidence shows that typically 38% of income comes from the\npublic sector in the form of government grants, or contracts (NCVO, 2006)) has required\nincreased transparency and for cost efficiency to be demonstrated. This, it has been argued,\nhas led to greater professionalisation of management in the not-for-profit sector (Batsleer,\n1995). There is evidence to show that the management of human resources has also been an\narea of significant change in recent years (Palmer, 2003, Palmer & Ross, 2004), with the\nestablishment of policies, more formalised training, use of more calculative reward policy\n(e.g. performance related pay) and employee consultation (Kellock Hay et al, 2001).\nHowever, the so called \u2018contract climate\u2019 means that providers are often not able to offer long\nterm, secure employment and may have difficulty passing on costs such as training to the\nservice funder. Therefore, the jobs on offer, in addition to being relatively poorly paid, are\noften not secure and career development opportunities are limited (Passey et al., 2000). These\nresource constraints and uncertainty can produce tensions in the employment relationship,\n7such that intrinsic job satisfaction and commitment to the cause are not translated into\norganisational commitment (Leason, 2002).\nCooke (2004) argues that in essence the contract culture has created a paradox. On the one\nhand there is a need for \u2018hard HRM\u2019 (characterised by low employment security, low level of\nreward, work intensification, lack of training and career development opportunities). On the\nother there is a need to sustain a high level of commitment, skills and professionalism to\nenable tangible results and value for money to be demonstrated in order to gain future\nfunding. Similarly, Alatrista and Arrowsmith (2004) argue that because of the constraints on\npay, there is a need for human resource management practices that emphasise non-financial\nmeans of eliciting employee motivation and commitment, but that faced with resource\nconstraints it may be difficult to achieve this. Whilst staff may be prepared to settle for lower\nwages, motivation is unlikely to be sustained in the longer term without job security, career\ndevelopment opportunities and improved pay and conditions (Cooke, 2004).\nFaced with labour shortages, traditionally it may be expected that organisations will compete\nwith each other for workers by improving the pay and benefits that they offer. Labour market\ntheory suggests that individuals choose jobs that offer them maximum benefits and move\nfrom one organisation to another if improved benefits are available (Price, 2004).\nAccordingly, pay and conditions will therefore be determined by the relative scarcity of\nparticular skills in the labour market (Price, 2004; Claydon, 2001). Economic theory supports\nthe idea that organisations raise salary levels when the labour market is tight and pay levels\nhave been shown to increase at a faster rate when unemployment is low (Blanchflower &\nOswald, 1994). There is also some evidence that reward systems within organisations have\ntangible influences on individuals in terms of organisational commitment, and therefore in\nturn on retention (Von Glinow, 1985). Claydon (2001) however, suggests that this idea of\nworkers moving freely between jobs in search of higher wages is too simple, as organisations\ndo not generally cut pay when unemployment is high. Similarly Pissarides (1985) asserts that\n8firms do not necessarily adjust wages upwards to overcome difficulties, firstly, because the\nwages offered depend not only on the productivity of the potential applicant, but also on the\nproductivity of other workers who are yet to be recruited. In addition, cost pressures and\ninternal relativities may prevent a company from increasing wages to overcome recruitment\nor retention difficulties. If this is the case then an organisation will have to try and identify\nalternative ways of attracting and retaining staff.\nFurthermore, research has suggested that an attractive salary and benefits package is not\nsufficient to attract and retain workers (Langan, 2000). Job seekers may not be aware of the\n\u2018going\u2019 wage rate or may find it difficult to compare pay and benefits across jobs, so\nconcentrate on the nature of the work, gross salary and opportunities for promotion (Carrell,\nElbert, & Hatfield, 1995). This would suggest that workers are not solely attracted to or\nencouraged to remain within an organisation by extrinsic rewards, such as pay and benefits,\nbut also by intrinsic rewards such as work content, or factors such as the opportunities for\ndevelopment or achieving a greater work-life balance. In those organisations which cannot\nrely on competitive pay rates, this would suggest that there may be a need to focus on non-\nfinancial benefits in order to attract and retain staff.\nMETHOD\nThe research on which this paper is based was part of a wider project designed to examine the\nresponses of organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors. The results reported\nhere will be drawn solely from the responses from voluntary sector organisations. In order to\ngain an insight into how organisations in the drug treatment sector responded to these\ncombined pressures, a two-part research design was adopted. This involved a postal survey\nof provider organisations asking about their human resource management policies and\npractices and a series of semi-structured interviews with human resource managers in a\nsample of provider organisations.\n9A postal questionnaire was distributed to 601 providers of drug services in England. London\nwas excluded from this study as it had already been examined in a previous study (Parry,\nKelliher, Mills and Tyson, 2005). This was because the Greater London Alcohol and Drug\nAlliance (GLADA) that is responsible for drug treatment within London wanted it to be\ntreated as a unique labour market, and therefore examined alone. As these two studies were\ncommissioned separately by GLADA and the National Treatment Agency (NTA), they\ndiffered slightly in purpose and format and have therefore been treated separately. The\norganisations were identified from lists of substance misuse service providers provided by\nlocal Drug Action Team (DAT) co-ordinators. The questionnaire was designed to gain data\non workforce demographics; recruitment and training policies; workforce planning strategies\nand recruitment and retention deficits.\nForty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with human resource managers and\nmanagers of voluntary provider organisations. This sample was stratified to ensure that it\ncontained representatives from all eight regions, rural and metropolitan areas and a range of\nsizes of organisations. Twenty-three interviews were also carried out with members of the\nDrug Action Teams who work with both not-for-profit and public sector organisations. These\ninterviews included discussion of a number of themes, namely the nature and source of\nrecruitment and retention difficulties and their responses to them. The content of these\ninterviews was analysed using the computer package NUD:ST in order to identify themes\nwithin the data.\nRESULTS\nIn total 181 voluntary sector organisations completed the survey, representing a 33% response\nrate. Below we present findings from the survey and the interviews. We present data first, on\nthe HRM policies in place, second, on the nature of recruitment difficulties experienced and\nthird, on the responses of the organisations to the challenge they faced.\n10\nHRM Policy\nIn order to build up a picture on the practise of HRM in these organisations, the questionnaire\nasked a number of questions about whether formal policies and procedures were in place.\nThe degree of policy in place serves, at least in part, as an indicator of how well prepared they\nwere to meet the human resource management aspects of QuADs.\n(Table 1)\nThe majority of organisations reported having a series of policies covering the main HRM\nactivities. Almost all organisations had an equal opportunities policy (99%) and formal\ngrievance procedures (99%) in place. Eighty six percent of organisations reported that they\nhad a written recruitment and selection policy and 96% reported having an equal\nopportunities in recruitment and selection policy. Most organisations (96%) also maintained\nup to date job descriptions and candidate specifications (96%) for all jobs. The vast majority\nreported having some form of formal training policy (91%) and in over half of cases (60%) it\nwas a written policy. Sixty one per cent of not-for-profit organisations had an annual training\nplan. Almost three-quarters (74%) of the organisations surveyed had an allocated training and\ndevelopment budget. On average this budget was in the region of 5% of the annual payroll\nbill. These findings would suggest that a reasonable degree of progress had been made\ntowards satisfying the human resource management aspects of QuADs.\nThe survey also asked more generally about compliance with the QuADs standards. The vast\nmajority of organisations indicated that they were aware of QuADS (95%) and had received a\nQuADS manual (89%). Approximately two thirds of organisations reported that they had\naudited their organisation against QuADs (66%), but at the time of data collection, less than a\nfifth reported that they were fully compliant with the standards (19%). The interviewees were\ndivided with regard to the ease of complying with the QuADS standards. One manager said\nthat: \u201cWe have no problems with it. It is easy as we are flexible in the voluntary sector.\u201d\nHowever, other managers felt that the process of complying with QuADS placed strain on\n11\ntheir resources and that they were finding it difficult to do the necessary work. A number of\norganisations had employed external consultants to help them become fully compliant with\nQuADS, in spite of the cost.\nResourcing\nIn the face of service expansion, it is perhaps not surprising that 75% of responding voluntary\nsector organisations indicated that they experienced recruitment difficulties.\n(Table 2)\nAn examination of those jobs where recruitment difficulties were greatest showed that this\nwas most common for management roles (29%) and project workers (29%).\n(Table 3)\nTurning to look at the reasons reported for the recruitment difficulties, it can be seen that the\nmost common causes were a lack of experience in applicants (84%); a lack of applicants per\nse (79%) and the inability of the voluntary sector organisations to match salary expectations\n(53%). Approximately half of the organisations surveyed also reported difficulties due to\ncandidates lacking the necessary technical skills (49%) or qualifications (50%). The\nprevalence of recruitment difficulties is also reflected in the amount of time that it took\norganisations to fill a post. On average it took 69 days to fill a management post, 57 days to\nfill a practitioner post and 46 days to fill an administration post.\nThe majority of managers interviewed also described some difficulties in recruitment.\nManagers indicated that ideally they would like to recruit staff with existing professional\nqualifications and some substance misuse experience and some reported that they had\ndeveloped competency frameworks that detailed the specific knowledge, skills and attributes\nthat they require. However, in practice it was reported that organisations commonly received\nfew applicants and often had to re-advertise before they were able to find a suitable candidate.\n12\nParticular difficulties were experienced with nurses, counsellors, doctors, and young person\u2019s\nworkers.\nThese recruitment difficulties were attributed to a number of reasons. By far the most\nprevalent explanation was an overall shortage of experienced and qualified drug treatment\nworkers. One manager remarked that \u201cThere just aren\u2019t a huge number of experienced drugs\nworkers around\u201d. Managers spoke of the difficulties finding suitable staff, especially when\nspecialist skills were required. In general it was felt that the pool of workers from which\norganisations were recruiting was too small to meet the expanding needs of the sector.\nRecruitment difficulties were also attributed to the nature of funding cycles within the sector.\nSince contract funding tends to be short-term, many reported that they were only able to offer\nstaff fixed-term contracts. This caused two problems. First, in general, potential applicants\nwere less interested in fixed-term posts and so this tended to reduce the overall number of\napplications. Second, given that funding is not always renewed, organisations are forced to\nshed staff at the end of a contract and recruit again when funding becomes available. In\naddition, the contracting environment meant that managers were under pressure to contain\ncosts and therefore felt unable to offer competitive salary and benefits packages. There was a\ngeneral consensus that salaries for substance misuse workers were lower than those for\nsimilarly qualified workers in other sectors.\nThere was also a perception that the substance misuse sector is not seen as attractive to\nworkers. A number of managers described the sector as having a stigma attached to it,\ntherefore making it difficult to encourage workers into the field. Thus the combination of low\nsalaries, negative impression of the field, the constraints imposed by the nature of funding,\ntogether with the general lack of appropriately skilled workers meant that voluntary sector\norganisations faced considerable difficulties recruiting staff.\n13\nIn terms of staff retention, on average these organisations reported an annual turnover of 24 %\n(compared with an average of 12 % in the public sector organisations). However, at least in\ncomparison to recruitment, most providers did not see employee retention as a major problem.\n(Table 4)\nThe most common reasons reported for employees leaving an organisation were to improve\ntheir career prospects (39%). Personal reasons or retirement was also relatively common\n(17%) as was improving salary levels (14%).\nMany respondents indicated that organisations do not tend to lose their staff once they have\nbeen recruited. It was suggested that many workers joined the substance misuse sector\nbecause they had a \u2018calling\u2019 to do so and therefore were less likely to leave. One manager\nexplained that \u201cThe turnover is low due to the ethos of the service. Workers have a strong\nshared understanding of the service and are involved in service development.\u201d However, one\nmanager commented that the sector relied too much on the commitment levels of their staff.\nThere was some concern expressed over an apparent trend of employees moving from the\nnot-for-profit into the statutory sector. Respondents explained this in terms of the higher\nsalaries and superior benefits available in the statutory sector. The nature of the funding cycle\nin the voluntary sector also causes some retention problems, in that workers tend to look for\nnew positions towards the end of their contracts and so sometimes were not retained, even if\nrenewed funding for their posts subsequently becomes available.\nResponding to the resourcing challenge\nIn spite of the difficulties recruiting and retaining appropriate staff, these organisations had\ndeveloped a number of approaches to help alleviate these problems. The interviewees\ndescribed a variety of strategies that they used in order to overcome recruitment difficulties.\nThese included recruiting staff from abroad (although this was reported to be very time\nconsuming, due to the legal issues involved), offering student placements, \u2018growing their\n14\nown\u2019 by means of training and career programmes and offering attractive conditions of\nemployment.\nOrganisations had become proactive with regard to keeping their employees. Where possible\nthey had increased salaries and improved the benefits offered to staff. Many voluntary sector\nproviders reported that staff tended to move to the statutory sector in order to further their\ncareers and so responded by taking steps to provide career opportunities within their own\norganisations, by, for example, creating specialist and senior posts. Smaller organisations,\nwith tighter resource constraints, reported that they concentrated on developing an open\norganisational culture, involving staff in decisions and promoting the ethos of the organisation\nto optimise the commitment of staff.\n(Table 5)\nSeveral respondents described using flexible working as a way of attracting and retaining\nstaff. It was believed that strategies such as these led to greater employee satisfaction and\nthereby encouraged workers to remain within the organisation. However, in practice, our\nfindings show what was available was relatively limited. The majority of organisations\noffered part-time working (85%) and flexitime (59%), but only a minority offered other forms\nof flexible working.\n(Table 6)\nTraining assumes great importance where there are shortages of qualified and experienced\nworkers within a sector. Interviewees reported that for many organisations they felt that the\nonly way to expand their workforce was to employ unqualified workers and provide them\nwith training. One manager described how they \u2018Look for personal skills, enthusiasm,\nconfidence, rather than qualifications and then put people into training. Drugs experience is a\nbonus.\u2019 In effect organisations had responded to the staff shortages by lowering the level of\n15\nskills and experience that they required in job applicants, in order to attract people into the\norganisation. They then addressed the employees\u2019 training needs once they were in the\norganisation. A number also reported that they had established trainee posts specifically for\nthis purpose. Some commented however that the employment of trainees could lead to\nadditional problems in the form of a young workforce that is not \u2018job ready\u2019.\nThe results of the survey show that practitioners received on average just over 9 days training\nper year, managers on average just over 8 days per year, while administration and manual\nstaff received on average 4 and 5 days per year, respectively. The greatest difficulty with\nregard to staff development appeared to be finding the necessary resources to provide the\nappropriate training. Most respondents indicated that they found it difficult to fund training.\nWhilst providers are able to include training costs when tendering for a contract, respondents\nreported that this was often challenged by commissioning managers and that when trying to\nreduce costs, training is often the first part of a bid to be cut. Training also created resourcing\nproblems, since employees need to be covered on the job while they are undertaking training.\nSeveral managers reflected that it would be useful to have a relief system of staff, similar to\nthe use of bank nurses in the NHS, in order to overcome this problem. A number of managers\nalso expressed concern regarding the quality of the training courses that were available. It was\nfelt that there was little consistency between those courses that were provided across the\ncountry. Others indicated that many of the specialised courses and conferences tend to be\nheld in the South East of England, making it harder for those elsewhere in the country,\nespecially in the North, to access appropriate training.\nBoth the survey and interviews found that provider organisations find it hard to recruit\nexperienced managers in particular, and as a result it was common practice for managers to\nhave been promoted from a practitioner role. This makes the need for management training\neven more important. One manager explained that: \u201cI was given the job without any\nqualifications or training. It was a very steep learning curve.\u201d Some providers, especially\n16\nsmaller organisations commented that it was especially difficult to find suitable training\ncourses for managers. At least one of the larger providers has addressed this by employing an\nexternal consultant to develop a structured competency framework for managers and to\ndesign training based upon these competencies. One manager described how most general\nmanagement training is aimed at managers in retail or such like and is not appropriate for\nmanagers within the substance misuse sector. There was a general feeling that management\ntraining was expensive as well as difficult to find funding for.\nA number of interviewees reported that an increasingly common way of recruiting workers\ninto the sector is via a formal volunteer training scheme. People are recruited to the\norganisation as a volunteer, based on personal attributes and transferable skills. They are then\nput through some form of structured training program with a view to eventually being\nemployed as a paid worker once they are trained. This strategy appears to have been\nrelatively successful, especially where workers obtain an accredited qualification at the end of\nthe training. It would appear that the organisations that experience fewer problems with\nrecruitment are the ones that have been proactive in this way. Volunteer schemes however it\nwas noted do have drawbacks, in that they can be expensive and cannot guarantee the\nretention of the worker after the programme. One manager described how \u201cMy organisation\ndoesn\u2019t have a volunteer scheme because this is resource intensive and we have insufficient\nmanagement capacity to set up such a scheme\u201d\nMany managers reported actively developing career development opportunities in their\norganisations as a means of retaining staff. Just over a third of respondents (37%) reported\nthat there was a clear career path within their organisations. Just over half (57%) of the\norganisations surveyed indicated that they trained their workers for promotion rather than just\ntheir current role. A number of organisations have employed consultants to examine their\nmanagement structure and the competencies underpinning this. Many managers spoke of\nadding team leader posts and trainee posts in order to create a career structure. However,\n17\ndespite these initiatives, the general feeling is that \u201cThe career structure within the sector is\nrelatively flat and that there are few opportunities for staff to progress within most\norganisations.\u201d\nOne manager spoke of \u2018dead man\u2019s shoes\u2019 in that employees have to wait for a manager to\nleave before they can progress. Another described the career structure within the sector as\n\u2018underdeveloped\u2019. This supports the results of the HR survey in that only a minority of\nrespondents felt that there was a clearly defined career path within their organisation. It was\nalso suggested though that the career structure within organisations would improve as the\nsector expands.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has gone beyond existing work which examines the increased involvement of the\nvoluntary sector in the provision of publicly funded services, because in addition the\nprovision of drug treatment services, as a result of government policy, has been a rapidly\nexpanding area of activity. Thus, in this study we have examined not only the effect of the\ncontracting environment, but also the effect of a significant expansion in service provision.\nOverall then, how had these voluntary sector providers responded to the challenges posed by\nthe UK Government\u2019s expansion programme for the provision of drug treatment services,\ncombined with the need to professionalise their people management, in a contract climate\nwhere cost reduction was dominant?\nIn terms of professionalising the management of human resources, the evidence suggests that,\nat least at the level of policy, these organisations had moved beyond the typical voluntary\nsector approach (Zacharias, 2003) and made some progress in developing a more\nsophisticated approach. The vast majority reported having a framework of policies in place\ncovering areas such as recruitment, training, equal opportunities and grievances. There was\n18\nalso evidence that these policies were translated into action, for example in the form of\nallocated budgets for training and the existence of a training planning process. Whilst a\nnumber of organisations expressed concern about their ability to fully meet the demands of\nthe QuADs, in terms of human resource management, the majority of organisations surveyed\ndid have the formal policies required in place. It would seem that the experience of the\nchanged policy context and the \u2018mixed economy of care\u2019, whereby voluntary sector\norganisations were able to become involved in the provision of publicly funded services had,\nin this sector, already led to a greater professionalisation of management (Batsleer, 1995), at\nleast in relation to human resources (Hay et al, 2001). These findings, broadly similar to an\nearlier study which focused solely on London (Parry, et al, 2005), would suggest that\ngovernment policy has had a significant effect on HRM in the sector.\nAs a result of the move to a \u2018mixed economy\u2019 of care, voluntary sector organisations have\nbecome more involved in the mainstream provision of public sector services, but have in turn\nbeen subject to the influence of those bodies they rely upon for future funding. In line with\ninstitutional theory, it could be argued that the activities and direction of voluntary\norganisations in this sector are increasingly being determined by the power of government\norganisations (Osborne, 1998). By requiring organisations bidding for the provision of\nservices to demonstrate their ability to comply to specified quality standards, they have not\nonly had an influence on the way in which human resources are managed, but have also\nattempted to create greater similarity across the sector.\nHowever, our findings represent a snapshot in time and stem from managerial respondents\nonly; as such we are not able to fully assess how these policies were implemented in practice.\nAs Paton and Foot (2000) observe, organisations may relate to award or audit systems in a\nvariety of ways and these may not necessarily result in significant change to practice. In this\ncontext the question also arises over whether such developments would have taken place\nirrespective of the imposition of QuADs. In line with the findings of other studies, managers\nmay have used the introduction of the standards as a lever to introduce changes to policy and\npractice, even where not strictly speaking required to attain the award (Paton and Foot, 2000)\n19\nThese findings show that voluntary sector organisations concerned with the supply of drug\ntreatment services have found the challenges placed on them by the expansion in service\nprovision difficult to manage. In particular they have struggled to recruit suitably qualified\nand experienced workers, with three-quarters of respondents indicating difficulties. These\nfindings paint a similar picture to studies conducted in other parts of the voluntary sector\nwhere there has been an increased involvement in the provision of publicly funded services\n(Nickson, Warhurst, Dutton & Hurrell, 2008), but suggest a more pervasive problem than in\nthe sector more generally (Wilding et al, 2003). It is perhaps not surprisingly that the\nsignificant expansion of drug treatment services had had the effect of exacerbating existing\nrecruitment problems, caused by the apparent stigma attached to the work and the lack of\npermanent employment as a result of contract funding. A surplus of suitably qualified and\nexperienced staff simply did not exist and given the time lag associated with gaining such\nqualifications and experience, a strategy of major expansion in the provision of drug\ntreatment services had, almost inevitably, created a significant labour shortage.\nConsequently provider organisations had to compete with one another for the available\nlabour. However, this situation of scarcity of skills had not, in line with conventional wisdom\n(Price, 2004, Claydon, 2001), had a major impact on the pay and conditions offered to\nworkers. Whilst some voluntary organisations reported that they had attempted to increase\nthe pay they offered, they had been unable to do this at a level that would alter the dynamics\nof this labour market and enable them to compete with public or private sector providers.\nThis can at least in part be explained by the contract environment in which these organisations\noperated, whereby the need to control costs, including labour costs was dominant.\nIf an organisation is unable to respond to a labour shortage by raising pay levels to a level\nwhere they can attract labour, they need to look to other non-financial means of addressing\nthe problem (Alastrista & Arrowsmith, 2004). The findings show that these organisations\n20\nresponded by offering flexible working arrangements, training, and development and career\nopportunities. \u2018Growing their own\u2019 by recruiting and training unqualified staff was seen as a\nway of not only offering an attractive employment proposition, but also as being proactive in\nexpanding the workforce and a number of providers had gone down this route, in spite of\nresource constraints in funding training. Creating trainee posts and developing volunteer\ntraining schemes, with a view to employment on completion were also among the approaches\nused. Although retention was generally seen as less of a problem than recruitment, a number\nof organisations had developed internal career structures in order to try and develop and retain\nstaff. However, it was acknowledged that the opportunities to do this were limited and in line\nwith the findings of Cunningham and James (2007), there was evidence that some of these\nstaff were lost to the public sector where more secure employment opportunities were offered.\nWhilst training and development were seen as means of tackling the root cause of the\nproblem, they experienced significant resource constraints both in terms of finding funding\nfor training (including the cost covering staff on off the job training), but also in terms of the\navailability of appropriate courses.\nThese voluntary sector organisations found themselves having to juggle conflicting pressures.\nIn addition to the need to contain labour costs, discussed above, the process of contracting and\nre-contracting had placed significant limitations upon these organisations\u2019 ability to attract\nand retain staff, because of the short-term nature of employment (Akingbola, 2004). The\norganisations had responded creatively to this demanding situation and they had employed a\nnumber of \u2018soft HRM\u2019 approaches designed to foster employee commitment and motivation\nby non-financial means (Alatrista & Arrowsmith, 2004), with some degree of success. At one\nlevel, this in turn had contributed to developing a more sophisticated approach to HRM.\nThis study has a number of limitations. Firstly, due to the way in which this and another\nstudy were commissioned, we have not included London in this study. An examination of the\ndifficulties experienced by drug treatment providers in London and their responses to these,\n21\nas permitted by our first study (Parry et al, 2005), suggests that the experience of\norganisations in London is similar to that discussed in this paper. Secondly, due to the focus\nof this research, the content of our interviews did not cover particular areas, which may be of\ninterest to future researchers in this area. For example, we have not included an analysis of\nthe role of the HR function or the HR manager within the provider organization, of the impact\nof legislation or the exact nature of reward and compensation. Future research should\nexamine these areas. Despite these limitations however, we have provided a contribution to an\nunder researched field through the examination of the challenges facing voluntary sector drug\ntreatment providers in recent years.\n22\nREFERENCES\nAkingbola, K (2006) \u2018Strategy and HRM in Nonprofit Organisations: evidence from Canada\u2019,\nInternational Journal of Human Resource Management, 17: 10, 1707-1725.\nAkingbola, K.
