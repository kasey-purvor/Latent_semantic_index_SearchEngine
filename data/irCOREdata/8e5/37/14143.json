However, despite its growing popularity, there are concerns\nthat the model is becoming a dominant discourse, being adapted as a template for the design of all\nonline teaching and learning, to the exclusion of other ideas. It is suggested that the five-stage model\nmay not be the panacea it appears and alternative models of e-learning cannot be ignored. This\npaper reviews the five-stage model and contrasts it with a new conceptual model, \u2018the e-learning\nladder\u2019, conceived as part of research with healthcare students in the higher education setting.\nIntroduction\nThe integration of e-learning into higher education pedagogy has occurred against a\nbackdrop that includes the development of a unified e-learning strategy (Department\nfor Education and Skills, 2005) and an increased focus on setting priorities for e-\nlearning research. Currently, the UK Joint Information Systems Committee is fund-\ning an e-Learning Programme.1 This includes an e-learning and pedagogy strand\nwith a focus on both designing for and understanding learning, including consider-\nation of learner participation in, and experience of, e-learning (Beetham, 2005).\nOne of the most popular process-based online teaching and learning models is that\nconceived by Salmon (2000, 2003). It is designed to demonstrate learner participa-\ntion in online learning and the role of the e-moderator or online facilitator. This five-\nstage approach \u2018Model of Teaching and Learning Online\u2019 provides a model that is easily\nunderstood and employed by a number of e-moderators within higher education,\nalthough it may not be the panacea it appears.\nThis paper reviews Salmon\u2019s five-stage model and contrasts it with a more embrac-\ning conceptual model of e-learning, \u2018the e-learning ladder\u2019, developed as part of\ndoctoral research completed within a higher education setting (Moule, 2005, 2006a).\n*University of the West of England, Faculty of Health and Social Care, Glenside Campus, Black-\nberry Hill, Stapleton, Bristol BS16 1DD, UK. Email: pam.moule@uwe.ac.uk\n38 P. Moule\nThe ladder design was based on the interpretations of research that asked whether\nstudents of the healthcare professions could develop the essential components of a\nCommunity of Practice (Wenger, 1998), while engaged in online learning. As such it\nrepresents the learner\u2019s experiences of e-pedagogy. It reflects an interpretation of e-\nlearning that encompasses instructivist, where the learner takes a more passive role\nlearning from provided knowledge, through to constructivist learning approaches,\nseen as learner focused, and endorses the building of learning on previous experience\nand learning (Peters, 2000).\ne-Moderating: the five-stage model\nDeveloped following research into online education and training with the Open\nUniversity, Salmon\u2019s (2003) model features five stages (see Table 1) presented as a\nflight of steps. Each stage identifies technical and e-moderating skills required, with\nan interactivity bar running along the steps that indicates varying amounts of interac-\ntion expected between the participants at each stage. This is seen as greatest towards\nthe end of stage three (information exchange), throughout stage four (knowledge\nconstruction) and into stage five (development). Participants are expected to progress\nthrough each of the five stages as part of online networking and group working. The\nstructure is designed to support a constructivist approach to learning.\nThis constructivist model of e-moderating provides a framework with clear\nprogressive stages that can support the design and facilitation of online courses. It\nreceived a number of uncritical citations in the United Kingdom when initially\npublished (Good, 2001; Barker, 2002, Bennett & Marsh, 2002; Thorpe, 2002). Its\nclarity has generated wide appeal, and consequently the model has been applied in\nstructuring online programmes (Lisewski & Joyce, 2003; Hughes et al., 2004). It\nshould be recognised, however, that the e-moderating model was developed from\nexperiences of facilitating online networking and group working. Its principle purpose\nis to provide a model for e-moderators to support student engagement and learning\nonline, employing constructivist pedagogic theory (Salmon, 2003). Consequently, it\nis limited because the variety of e-learning approaches available for use within\nTable 1.

While constructivist online learning communities\nare often adopted in higher education (Wong et al., 2003), the five-stage model has\nnot reflected the potential available to use e-learning as part of an integrated approach\nthat includes face-to-face delivery. Indeed, Chowcat (2005) found the model ineffec-\ntive when used to train those mentoring head teachers in the United Kingdom.\nChowcat suggested the model assumes an exclusive online environment will be used\nto support a course run to a specific timeframe of one week for each stage. The course\nstructure proved difficult to sustain in the school year, with Chowcat concluding that\nthe model may not readily transfer to different learning situations.\nThere are further concerns that the model is dominating discourse in learning tech-\nnologies, being seen as a template for the design of all online teaching and learning\nenvironments regardless of the context. There is a broad concern that the reification\nof models of learning and teaching, while meeting organisation needs for transferable,\nmulti-use products, will dominate and stifle professional practice development. For\nexample, Lisewski and Joyce (2003) presented difficulties seen when using the five-\nstage model as a template for an e-moderating training course. The course failed to\ntake account of individual learning styles and the rigid application of its design was\ndifficult to challenge. This led them to highlight the dangers of reification. Objectify-\ning the model transforms it to a product that is seen as a \u2018one size fits all\u2019, for use\nacross any number of teaching and learning contexts. Paradoxically, reification of the\nmodel undermines its ethos, which seeks to support reflective practice. Through\nslavishly applying the model as a rigid course, any opportunities to develop flexibility\nand reflexivity are lost.\nFurther research by Jones and Peachey (2005) presents a critical review of the five-\nstage model. Their main criticisms are levelled at the stages of socialisation. Jones and\nPeachey included face-to-face contact as part of the initial stage. They were unable to\ndetermine whether an \u2018appropriate\u2019 level of socialisation was achieved here, as little\nguidance is offered that allows such measurement. Furthermore, activities in Stage\ntwo were subdued, with a reduced number of postings seen. This led Jones and\nPeachey (2005) to suggest that stage two may be omitted if initial socialisation in\nstage one has been effective. The findings also suggest those employing the model\nmight need further guidance to enable judgements about the readiness of participants\nto progress through the stages of the model.\ne-Learning ladder: theoretical development\nThe e-learning ladder was conceived as part of research exploring whether the essen-\ntial characteristics of Communities of Practice (Wenger, 1998) develop in higher\n40 P. Moule\neducation online learning environments (see Moule, 2005, 2006a, b). Conducted in\na university using a case-study approach (Yin, 1994), data were collected from\nhealthcare students taking part in a six-week online module. From the sample of 15,\nfive students completed online diaries, three students were interviewed and a group\nof seven students were involved in an online discussion board.\nAn increasing number of studies are applying Wenger\u2019s (1998) theory to online\nlearning contexts as interest in constructivist approaches to e-learning develop.\nConducted in America, Rogers (2000) sampled 26 teachers and administrators\nparticipating in a three-week workshop, \u2018Teachers of English as a Second or Other\nLanguage\u2019. Online dialogue was analysed, suggesting the presence of Wenger\u2019s\n(1998) elements of mutual engagement, joint enterprise and shared repertoire. A\nfurther study of three software engineering students in the United Kingdom is\npresented by Chalk (2001). Based on limited analysis of team documentation and\nresponses to a \u2018hidden\u2019 examination question, Chalk (2001) implied students\u2019 online\nexperiences constituted a Community of Practice. Both case studies have a number\nof weaknesses and the results should be interpreted with caution. In particular, the\nsmall sample sizes and limited periods of engagement weaken the conclusions.\nIndeed, Hildreth (2004) presents a further case study of an online Community of\nPractice, highlighting some of the problems and issues involved in trying to build\nrelationships across dispersed boundaries.\nWenger\u2019s (1998) theory has also been employed in the evaluation of a virtual learn-\ning environment, built to support an undergraduate medical course (Ellaway et al.,\n2004), identifying aspects of the learning environment that could be improved.\nEarlier research used the theory to review online working, with Somekh and Pearson\n(2000) analysing electronic interactions among researchers during a European\nproject that considered children\u2019s representation of information and communication\ntechnology (ICT). Dispersed working seemed to confound the negotiation of joint\nenterprise, with deadlines often being missed. Different shared repertoires and\nhistories of research methods affected mutual engagement, as participants were\nunable to develop shared understanding of the action research approach used. More\nrecently, Seale (2004) applied the theory to the interpretation of a literature review\nthat explored the enterprise of accessibility practices in e-learning. The findings high-\nlighted the need for learning technologists to share accessibility practices and focus\non the process of accessibility, rather than the product.\nFinding similar results to Rogers (2000) and Chalk (2001), elements of mutual\nengagement, joint enterprise and shared repertoire emerged from the analysis of the\ntextual data collected in this study. The results suggested healthcare students were\nable to develop a Community of Practice, although this was not uniformly seen\n(Moule, 2005, 2006a). It was apparent that operating within a Community of Prac-\ntice online held complications arising from the e-based context of learning (Moule,\n2006a). The emerging issues were related to access, trust development, the need for\ntechnical skills and support, facilitation issues, group working and the effects of\nlongevity of participation. These issues were extracted to develop the \u2018supports\u2019 for\nthe \u2018rungs\u2019 of a conceptual model for e-learning\u2014the e-learning ladder.\nChallenging the five-stage model for e-learning 41\nThe e-learning ladder\u2014a conceptual model\nIn contrast to the five-stage model, the e-learning ladder (Moule, 2005) acknowl-\nedges a range of learning approaches, starting at the bottom \u2018rung\u2019 with an isolated\napproach to learning that might be termed as instructivist and moving through the\n\u2018rungs\u2019 ending with constructivist, or interactive learning approaches (see Figure 1).\nThrough the inclusion of different learning approaches from isolated through to inter-\nactive learning, it acknowledges that not all e-learning is constructivist or course\nbased and reflects the range of e-based learning materials available. Although not\nexplicitly expressed, there is an expectation that the e-resources introduced might be\nused as part of a blended learning approach or incorporated within classroom deliv-\neries. For example, learners using CD-ROMs or web-based materials to gain essential\nknowledge to support skill development are likely to attend a face-to-face skills prac-\ntice session to develop the practical skills to compliment theoretical learning.\nFigure 1. A conceptual model of online learning: the e-learning ladderThe structure of a ladder is not meant to imply that students must move up through\neach \u2018rung\u2019 to reach the top; rather, it is a presentation of a conceptual ladder of learn-\ning. It shows how learning might be positioned at instructivist to constructivist levels.\nAlthough presented hierarchically in a ladder structure, it is intended that the \u2018rungs\u2019\nshould be viewed as presenting flexible pedagogies, which inter-link. It is additionally\nsuggested that the \u2018rungs\u2019 might be developed over time to allow the incorporation of\nFigure 1. A conceptual model of online learning: the e-learning ladder\n42 P. Moule\nnew methods of e-delivery, such as the expanding use of mobile technologies, to\nsupport learning in higher education.\nThe ladder \u2018rungs\u2019\nThe initial \u2018rung\u2019 includes information gathering that might encompass using\nbibliographic databases to search for material and accessing course notes. Rusby\u2019s\n(1979) classification of software would see this level as emancipatory, where the\ncomputer acts as an aid to learning but is not central to the learning process. It\nenables the student to access material that might support their learning.\nThe second \u2018rung\u2019 incorporates the use of interactive media for learning, such as\nCD-ROMs. The level of interaction is limited to the learner working with the\neducational media. This would be seen as the instructional paradigm (Rusby,\n1979), where information is presented, broken into steps to aid learning. This\nreflects a behavourist approach to learning pioneered by Skinner, where specific\nsteps in the process must be learned and followed (Nye, 1996). One example is a\nbasic life-support CD-ROM developed to support competency development. It\nincludes the steps in the skill, and tests assess the learner\u2019s knowledge of the topic\n(Moule & Gilchrist, 2001). Materials at this level might also include those with\nsimulations and animations to explore the real world, viewed as the revelatory para-\ndigm (Rusby, 1979). A statistical program allowing learners to change the values of\nvariables (Adams, 2004) provides one example. These packages engage learners in\nexploratory learning and \u2018mental model building\u2019, a constructivist technique that\nalso features in the higher \u2018rungs\u2019 and as such is an example of the inter-linking of\npedagogies between the \u2018rungs\u2019. Materials can be further developed to meet Rusby\u2019s\n(1979) definition of the conjectural paradigm. These materials provide greater scope\nfor learners to set their own learning parameters; for example, through conducting\nvirtual experiments (Bell, 1999).\nThe higher \u2018rungs\u2019 encompass learning approaches that would be seen as\nconstructivist. They encourage the learner to think creatively and problem-solve,\nupdate knowledge and skills, and develop analysis, critical thinking and evaluation\n(Adams, 2004). The final three \u2018rungs\u2019 of the ladder include aspects of interaction\nand engagement, although they suggest an incremental development of this, with the\ngreatest scope for learning through interaction and discussion being placed within\nthe higher rungs. These \u2018rungs\u2019 support a social constructivist approach to learning\nbased on the theories of Vygotsky (1978), where learning is constructed through\nsocial interaction.\nVideo conferencing on the third \u2018rung\u2019 allows synchronous transmission of learning\nmaterials. The learner will engage by listening to delivery and may interact through\nquestioning and verbal discussion. This may support debate, argument and reflection\nin knowledge creation, also seen as present within the next \u2018rung\u2019. The fourth \u2018rung\u2019\npresents discussion boards and email. These allow students to interact online through\nasynchronous communication as the fifth \u2018rung\u2019. This approach gives scope for\nstudent-led debate and interaction that contributes to knowledge creation. The\nChallenging the five-stage model for e-learning 43\nvirtual classroom enhances communication opportunities, providing a vehicle for\nsynchronous communication, used by the students for decision-making. This is\nviewed as enhancing opportunities for effective online communication, essential to\nknowledge development. At the top of the ladder is Communities of Practice\n(Wenger, 1998), where interaction among learners is vital to the development of\nmutual engagement, joint enterprise and shared repertoire. The development of iden-\ntity is dependent on engagement in the community, with knowledge and learning\nbeing constructed through understanding gained within the community. Engagement\nin a community might require the student to employ all of the learning approaches\nidentified in the lower \u2018rungs\u2019. This can include drawing on databases to access infor-\nmation to support the community endeavour and engaging in the use of discussion\nboards, email and virtual classroom to communicate, problem-solve and support\ndecision-making with community members.\nThe ladder \u2018sides\u2019\nThe \u2018sides\u2019 of the ladder demonstrate the support needed for learners to access the\n\u2018rungs\u2019. These results are drawn from the study data (Moule, 2005) and are presented\nhere as verbatim quotes labelled DB1\u2013DB7 (discussion board members), D1\u2013D5\n(online diaries) and as attributed to interviewees I1\u2013I3. There is the potential for\nsupport to increase as the student climbs the ladder, depicted by the arrows at the\n\u2018sides\u2019. Learners may require greater support in some areas as the technological\ncomplexity of the online environment increases, although this need not be uniform.\nFor example, as part of the research study not all the learners experienced difficulties\nin the use of virtual classrooms and discussion boards, requiring the development of\nICT skills. This said, often those with some computer familiarity are required to\ndevelop ICT skills in certain contexts. Andrusyszyn et al. (1999), in evaluating\ncomputer conferencing, found that despite nurses having access to home computers,\nthe Internet and using email, they needed technical guidance in the use of computer\nconferencing technology.\nAccess.   Access coupled with motivation forms the first stage of Salmon\u2019s (2003)\nmodel. At this stage Salmon refers to the need for e-moderators and participants to\ngain access to the online system. It is suggested that participants may need some tech-\nnical support at this point to facilitate access. The e-learning ladder also includes\naccess as a potential issue, but relates it to all e-based learning, suggesting that access\nissues might increase for some users as the technological complexity of the online\nenvironments intensify. Access is therefore not viewed merely as initial but as ongoing\nissue, as one student without computer access at home highlights. \nI think I lost nearly two stone walking into Uni, that\u2019s the biggest advantage of online\nlearning. (DB1)\nAccess to appropriate ICT hardware, software and network connections is required\nto support e-learning, and is often problematic to learners. \n44 P. Moule\nJust to let you know that this weekend the Uni computer system is shutting down\u2014so I\nhave the weekend off. (DB3)\nRadiographers have been unable to access BB [Blackboard] for a number of days. (D3)\nAn earlier study highlights access difficulties seen for higher education students,\nsupporting these findings. McMahon et al. (1999), sampling 835 first-year students\nin Belfast, found students experienced access difficulties that proved to be a barrier\nto computer use.\nA further concern is access for those with disabilities. Difficulties can exist for the\nvisually impaired, colour blind, deaf and those unable to operate a mouse. Such\ndisabilities can affect individual ability to engage with the computer and access visual\nimagery such as graphics and colour and audio presentation.2 All educational\ninstitutions need to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Her\nMajesties Stationery Office, 1995) and Special Educational Needs and Disability Act\n(Her Majesties Stationery Office, 2001).\nTechnical skills.   The need for increased technological skill development among e-\nlearners was identified by Andrusyszyn et al. (1999) in an evaluation of computer\nconferencing that confirmed the need for technological guidance in the use of tech-\nnology. Boyle and Wambach (2001), Curtis et al. (2002) and Hong et al. (2003)\ncomment on a lack of confidence and fear as barriers to using technology for online\nlearning, following research with postgraduate students studying in higher education.\nIndeed, students in this study noted, \nI\u2019m \u2026 an adult nurse who is very scared about IP3 [online module]. (DB7)\nFor me personally, getting to grips with the IT side of it. My confidence was one or two\n\u2026\u2019 (I1)\nSalmon (2003) reflects on the possible need to support participants with technical\nskills at different stages of the model, although referring to these as technical support.\nThe ladder demonstrates that the technical skills of learners will need consideration\nacross a range of e-learning materials and deliveries, with the possibility of the need\nfor such skills to increase as the engagement in e-learning becomes more complex.\nThis was seen in the research results as students familiar with computer use at the\nlower \u2018rungs\u2019 found use of components of the virtual learning environment difficult. \nThere were no problems with going online, although it took me ten minutes to work out\nhow to use the virtual classroom. (D1)\nThe ladder separates technical skills from technical support, however, highlighting\nthe need for ongoing support for computer-based learning, whether it employs\ninstructivist or constructivist learning approaches.\nTechnical support.   Not only do learners potentially need support with initial access to\nhardware, learning resources and networks, but also issues can arise with ongoing\nChallenging the five-stage model for e-learning 45\ntechnological delivery. Cooper and McConnell (2000) identified that technical issues\nwere one of the least favourite aspects of a web-based tool supporting physiotherapy\nstudent learning in Scotland. A number of students involved in this research\nexperienced problems with password access to the virtual learning environment\n(Moule, 2005) and further examples of the need for ongoing technical support were\nhighlighted. \nSometime during the day it was difficult to get into the Blackboard. A message kept saying\nthat the request to get into the Blackboard was timed out. (D1)\nAfter entering the v-classroom about twenty mins into the conversation I was thrown out\nof the classroom \u2026 This also happened to other members. (D2)\nIt is suggested that the need for technological support may increase with the\ncomplexity of the learning environment being used, although some may have greater\nICT skills than others, eliminating the need for technical support. This does not\ndetract from the need for educational providers to ensure technical support is\navailable and accessible. Atack (2003) provides an example of users failing to ask for\ntechnical help when needed, which stemmed from their lack of ICT knowledge.\nFacilitation.   Bender (2003) suggests that the role of the facilitator is important in\nsupporting initial socialisation and ongoing maintenance of online groups. Salmon\u2019s\n(2003) model focuses on the role of the e-moderator, identifying the different e-\nmoderating skills required in each of the five stages. This component of the model\nseeks to enable e-moderators, offering practical guidance to those facilitating student\nengagement in online learning. The e-moderator role is further supported through a\nsecond publication (Salmon, 2002) that concentrates on e-activities.\nA number of international studies conducted in higher education settings identify\nstudent dissatisfaction with online tutor support (Hara & Kling, 2000; Monteith &\nSmith, 2001; Hong et al., 2003). This discord seems to reflect the frustration felt by\nstudents, who identify a lack of online interaction with their facilitators. Monteith and\nSmith (2001) suggest this may be related to difficulties experienced by moderators of\nconstructivist approaches to learning who are unsure when they should interject.\nFacilitation is highlighted as a necessary support for all e-learners throughout the\nladder, including those engaged in constructivist learning approaches. A number of\nstudents looked to the facilitator to address specific questions such as one enquiring\nabout the style of presentation needed for the assessment. \nI was wondering about the use of the first person \u2026 (DB2)\nIt is felt that online facilitation will be increased when employing these learning\napproaches, but that there may still be a need for facilitation for those using interac-\ntive learning media or gathering web-based information. The facilitation need not\nalways be conducted in the online context, but may relate to the preparation of\nparticipants for learning and any subsequent activities or learning that relate to the\nuse of materials or development of skills that might occur in a face-to-face setting. In\n46 P. Moule\nother words, the facilitation may occur as part of a blended approach to learning,\nwhere the application of e-based learning or information is facilitated.\nGroup working.   The e-learning ladder includes group working and composition as\none of the \u2018sides\u2019. Group composition was seen as important to the functioning of the\nCommunities of Practice as it was felt to impact on group working. The discussion\ngroup members had pre-established friends in the group. This group worked effec-\ntively, developing shared repertoire and forming relationships during the module. \nI agree that we should follow the learning outcomes, then maybe adapt some of them to\nour group\u2019s needs. (DB4)\nOther students also felt they had developed relationships within their groups, with\none stating: \nTwo days before submission people were putting up supportive messages. (I2)\nPrevious knowledge of group members has been found to aid group functioning.\nAs part of Australian research with 114 business students, Andrews and Schwarz\n(2002) found learning behaviours were linked to team performance, with those teams\nwhere members already knew each other performing more highly.\nThe initial phase of the research also saw time spent on social learning as individ-\nuals tried to socialise into the group, although for some online socialisation was\nproblematic. For example, one student felt that relationship-building for her was best\nachieved in a face-to-face environment: \nFor group working for me, I would like to know the people I am working with. (I3)\nEffective learning online requires the support of underpinning social processes, as\nteam relationships have an impact on performance. Joiner (2004) also asserts that the\nassumed advantages of constructivist online learning are being challenged, with\nrecent research showing there is no evidence of equal participation. Indeed one\nstudent commented on such issues. \nThere only seem to be myself and two others who are pulling our weight! (D5)\nThere is a need to create effective social collaboration and networking between\nmembers as computer-mediated learning will not automatically lead to effective\ncollaboration. The five-stage model (Salmon, 2003) includes the interactivity bar,\nwhich assumes interaction between the e-moderator and group members. This is also\nimplied through the engagement expected throughout the stages, including online\nsocialisation and information exchange. Salmon (2003) also discusses the use of\nstructured exercises and assessment that encourage student participation and group\nfunctioning. Group working is obviously a fundamental requirement for constructiv-\nist approaches to learning, and consideration of initial group composition or sociali-\nsation processes will aid its development. The ladder includes group composition and\nworking as a facet for consideration across different learning approaches that might\nbe employed. Although the need for effective group functioning is seen as increasing\nas more constructivist approaches are used, there is recognition that students may be\nChallenging the five-stage model for e-learning 47\nusing interactive learning materials or gathering information as part of a group, or\nindeed use these approaches to inform a Community of Practice.\nLongevity of engagement.   Longevity of engagement is a feature affecting the online\nlearning environment, particularly if a constructivist learning approach is used.\nIndeed, those employing the five-stage model have commented on the difficulties of\nuse in the short time-frame proposed (Lisewski & Joyce, 2003; Chowcat, 2005). The\nperiod of engagement is of particular concern where there are expectations that a\nCommunity of Practice will emerge (Moule, 2005, 2006a). The role of shared histo-\nries in the development of a Community of Practice, it is suggested, will render unfea-\nsible their development in short term courses (Fowler & Mayes, 1999). A shortened\nperiod of engagement can affect the commitment of the participants, as seen in this\nresearch where one student preferred to maintain contact with existing peers rather\nthan invest in a short lived community. \nThe majority of the information I am getting is obtained from fellow students not in my\n[online] group. (D5)\nIt will also adversely affect the development of shared repertoire, which will emerge\nover a long period of engagement. Given these concerns, longevity of engagement is\na component of the ladder, seen as increasing in emphasis at the top of the ladder,\nwhen participants are engaging in more constructivist learning approaches. The \u2018side\u2019\nrepresenting engagement extends the full length of the ladder, acknowledging the\nneed for participant engagement at every level of learning.\nConclusions\nThis paper has offered a critical review of the five-stage model, comparing it with the\ne-learning ladder and highlighting the different interpretations of e-learning\npresented in each. Discussions have also identified areas of similarity seen, where\nboth the five-stage model and the e-learning ladder include the factors necessary to\nenable engagement in e-learning environments such as access and technical support.\nIn presenting such dialogue the paper makes a contribution to the current agendas\nthat seek to understand learner participation in, and experiences of, e-learning.\nThe discussion challenges the view that e-learning in higher education must reflect\na constructivist approach to learning, reinforcing the opportunities for e-learning to\nsupport instructivist approaches, blended learning and classroom supported delivery.\nThe e-learning ladder is offered as a conceptual model that provides one interpreta-\ntion of e-learning, which in the future might be expanded to incorporate the potential\nof mobile technology deliveries within higher education.\nNotes\n1.
