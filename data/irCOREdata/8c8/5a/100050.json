In order to illustrate these issues three case studies are\npresented of detectors operating in different statistical regimes which require\nnovel approaches to data analysis.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nStudies of stellar and galactic dynamics on progressively larger scales indicate the presence of large\nquantities of invisible or \u2018dark\u2019 matter which neither absorbs nor emits electromagnetic radiation [1].\nThis dark matter is invisible to conventional astronomy and yet makes up at least 90% of the mass\ndensity of the universe. It is now believed that the total mass density is \u0002 30% of the critical density\n[2] but the measured primordial abundances of the light elements are only found to be consistent with\nthe predictions of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) for a baryonic contribution to this density \u0003 5%.\nThis indicates that the majority of the dark matter is non-baryonic in form. Stable particle candidates\nfor this non-baryonic dark matter are provided by many theories extending the Standard Model, however\nthe leading contender is generally the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) from R-Parity conserving\nSUSY theories [1]. The LSP (typically the lightest neutralino) is just one of a broad class of candidates\ncollectively referred to as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Any positive evidence for\nthe existence of WIMP dark matter would have profound implications for both cosmology and particle\nphysics.\n2 DIRECT DETECTION EXPERIMENTS\nModels which predict the existence of WIMP dark matter such as supersymmetry typically also predict\nthat WIMPs couple weakly to baryonic matter such as atomic nuclei [3]. Studies of the dynamics of\nstars within spiral galaxies such as our own also indicate that a relatively large amount of the dark matter\nis trapped within the potential wells of these galaxies [1]. It may therefore be possible to detect WIMP\ndark matter by searching for the elastic scattering of nuclei contained in earth-borne detectors. The\nobserved energy spectrum \u0004\u0006\u0005\b\u0007\t\u0004\u000b\n\r\f of such nuclear recoils depends upon a number of factors related to\nthe kinematics of the scattering process and the phase- space distribution of WIMPs trapped in the galaxy\n( \u000e\u0010\u000f\u0012\u0011\u0014\u0013\u0015\n\u0017\u0016\u0019\u0018 where \u0011 is the target atomic mass and \n\u0017\u0016 is the nuclear recoil energy), the nuclear physics of\nthe mass and spin distributions of the nuclei (form-factors \u001a\ufb01\ufb00\ufb02\u000f\u0012\u0011\b\u0013\u0015\n\ufb03\u0016\u0019\u0018 and coupling enhancements \u001f \u000f\u0012\u0011!\u0018 )\nand the particle physics of the WIMPs themselves (mass and WIMP-nucleon interaction cross-section\n\"\u0006# ). Other detector dependent factors include the mass fraction of element \u0011 in the target ( $\u0019\u000f\u0012\u0011%\u0018 ), the\nnuclear recoil quenching factor ( &'\u000f\u0012\u0011!\u0018 - defined below) and the detector energy response matrix ( ()\u000f\u0012\n \f \u0018 ).\nThe resulting energy spectrum formula is:\n\u0004\u0006\u0005\n\u0004\u000b\n\r\f+*\n\"\n#\ufb02,.-\n$\u0019\u000f\u0012\u0011!\u00180\/1\u000e\u0010\u000f\u0012\u0011\u0014\u0013\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\u00180\/2\u001f \u000f\u0012\u0011!\u00180\/2\u001a\n\ufb00\n\u000f\u0012\u0011\b\u0013\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\u00180\/ &'\u000f\u0012\u0011!\u00180\/3(4\u000f\u0012\n\n\f\n\u0018 (1)\nOf the terms appearing in the above formula the kinematic factor and nuclear form-factors lead\nto an overall recoil spectrum which falls rapidly with increasing energy (Fig. 1) thus making the use of\ndetectors with low recoil energy thresholds ( \u0003 10 keV) especially important. The coupling enhancements\n81\nlead to increased scattering cross-sections for heavy nuclei (scalar interactions) and those with large\nspin (axial-vector interactions) through nuclear coherence effects. This further constrains the choice of\ndetector materials. The final consideration is that the expected WIMP interaction rate is extremely small\n( \u0003 1 \/kg\/day) and in particular it is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of the main source of\nbackground events, namely electron recoils caused by beta decay and Compton scattering of naturally\noccurring background radiation. This background event rate must therefore be reduced, initially by\nshielding detectors with high purity, high-Z materials and by purifying detector components to remove\nradioactive contaminants such as isotopes from the U and Th decay chains. Operation of experiments\ndeep underground is important for removing background nuclear recoils caused by elastic scattering of\nhigh energy neutrons from cosmic ray spallation but also reduces the ambient level of photon radiation.\nSpin Independent5\n106 206 306 406\nEv (keV)\n0.001\n0.010\n0.100\n1.000\n10.000\ndR\n\/d\nE \n(\/k\neV\n\/kg\n\/da\ny)\n7\nm8 w=\nv9 0 =\nv9 esc =\n          20 GeV\/c2\n        270 km\/s\n        600 km\/s\nSpin Dependent5\n106 206 306 406\nEv (keV)\n0.001\n0.010\n0.100\n1.000\n10.000\ndR\n\/d\nE \n(\/k\neV\n\/kg\n\/da\ny)\n7\nm8 w=\nv9 0 =\nv9 esc =\n          20 GeV\/c2\n        270 km\/s\n        600 km\/s\nSpin Independent5\n106 206 306 406\nEv (keV)\n0.001\n0.010\n0.100\n1.000\n10.000\ndR\n\/d\nE \n(\/k\neV\n\/kg\n\/da\ny)\n7\nm8 w=\nv9 0 =\nv9 esc =\n       10000 GeV\/c2\n        270 km\/s\n        600 km\/s\nSpin Dependent5\n106 206 306 406\nEv (keV)\n0.001\n0.010\n0.100\n1.000\n10.000\ndR\n\/d\nE \n(\/k\neV\n\/kg\n\/da\ny)\n7\nm8 w=\nv9 0 =\nv9 esc =\n       10000 GeV\/c2\n        270 km\/s\n        600 km\/s\nFig. 1: Simulated WIMP induced nuclear recoil spectra in a NaI(Tl) scintillator detector. The plots correspond to spectra\nexpected for 20 GeV\/c : (top) and 10 TeV\/c : (bottom) WIMPs, for spin independent (left) and spin dependent (right) WIMP-\nnucleon interactions. The full histograms are raw spectra obtained from Eqn. (1) without taking into account detector response\nwhile the dashed lines show the same spectra following convolution with the detector response matrix [4].\nA further measure which can be taken to reduce the rate of background events is to use a detec-\ntor material possessing electron recoil discrimination properties. Such properties generally derive from\nthe differing \u0004\u0006\n;\u0007\t\u0004\u0006< (energy loss) of nuclei and electrons of similar recoil energies, which can lead to\nincreased \u2018quenching\u2019 of charge produced in solid and liquid targets. Examples include scintillation\n82\npulse-shape differences in materials such as NaI(Tl) [5] and liquid xenon [6], reduced electron to photon\nratios in double-phase xenon detectors [7], reduced photon to phonon ratios in cryogenic scintillation\ndetectors [8] and reduced charge to phonon ratios in cryogenic ionisation detectors [9]. It is important to\nnote however that in addition to reducing the rate of background events the use of such techniques permits\ndetectors to actively discover a WIMP dark matter signal rather than just set limits on its interaction rate\nor cross-section. The reason for this is that direct detection experiments, unlike collider experiments,\noperate in a regime where the absolute rate and energy spectrum of background events is only poorly\nknown. This means that it is difficult to identify a signal purely as an excess of events above expected\nbackground, as is the case with a counting experiment. Through the use of a discriminating variable\nmeasuring one of the discriminating properties listed above however, the background rate in the signal\nregion can be determined through a combination of signal and background calibration and measurement\nof the event rate in the background dominated region. Detector sensitivity can be improved significantly\nin this way and the use of detector materials possessing intrinsic background discrimination properties is\nnow the main factor influencing the design of direct detection experiments.\n3 ANALYSING DATA\nThe need to make optimum use of all information provided by a detector drives the choice of statistical\ndata analysis techniques. In smaller detectors ( \u0003 50 kg) this information is generally confined to a mea-\nsurement of event energy and one discriminating parameter. At present the analysis typically proceeds\nin two steps:\n1. Analyse the distribution of the discriminating parameter using a Gaussian fit or cut-based Poisson\nanalysis to determine the number of nuclear recoil signal events contained within the data. No\nassumption is made about the origin of any nuclear recoils at this stage.\n2. Interpret the measured number of nuclear recoil events in terms of a WIMP signal by fitting\nto the observed energy spectrum in order to define a confidence or exclusion region in WIMP\nmass\/interaction cross-section parameter space.\nThis process has the advantage that the initial stage of the analysis is completely independent of the\nWIMP mass or WIMP-nucleon interaction cross-section and hence can be performed once for a given\ndata set. All dependence on the WIMP parameters is \u2018factorised\u2019 out into the second stage, which in\ngeneral is quicker to perform. An open question remains as to whether improved sensitivity can be\nobtained by combining these two steps into a single two-dimensional fit or event selection. If the WIMP\nmodel-independence of the discriminating parameter is total then there will presumably be little or no\nimprovement however this has still to be confirmed.\nIn larger detectors ( = 50 kg) additional information regarding the WIMP nature of a nuclear recoil\nsignal can be provided by examining the time spectrum of candidate events. At different times of the year\ndetectors move with different velocities relative to the \u2018halo\u2019 of dark matter particles trapped in our galaxy\ndue to the earth\u2019s motion around the sun. This causes the average flux and hence nuclear recoil event\nrate to modulate by \u0002 3% over the course of the year. Searches for such an annual modulation signature\nare potentially fraught with systematic problems due to seasonal fluctuation of the background event\nrate, however the technique becomes competitive when using large detectors and several experiments\nhave chosen to take this approach. The DAMA collaboration [10] in particular have claimed positive\nevidence for a signal using this technique (Fig. 2) and this is currently providing a focus for many of\nthe experimental efforts around the world. An open question is whether annual modulation, background\ndiscrimination and energy information can be combined in a more efficient manner to improve detector\nsensitivity.\nTo illustrate the above considerations a number of case studies will now be considered.\n83\nDAMA\/\nNaI-1\nDAMA\/\nNaI-2\nDAMA\/>\nNaI-3?\nDAMA\/\nNaI-4\nFig. 2: Residual event rate following subtraction of the mean from the total event rate observed in the DAMA-NaI detector\narray as a function of time over the course of 57986 kg.days of running [11].\n4 CASE STUDY 1: NAIAD\nThe UK Dark Matter Collaboration [12] operates a 60 kg array of NaI(Tl) scintillator detectors (\u2018NaIAD\u2019)\nat the Boulby Mine in North Yorkshire. Iodine is a heavy nucleus (A=127) with a large spin-independent\ncoupling enhancement while both sodium and iodine possess significant spin-dependent coupling en-\nhancements. NaI(Tl) is relatively radio-pure and offers a low recoil energy threshold due to its high\nlight-output and favourable nuclear recoil quenching factors (the ratio of the numbers of photons emitted\nin nuclear and electron recoil events of the same recoil energy). A major additional advantage is that\nthe time spectrum of emitted scintillation photons (the scintillation pulse-shape) depends sensitively on\nthe type of recoil, permitting the use of Pulse-Shape Discrimination techniques (PSD). Simple PSD in-\nvolves approximating the observed time spectrum with an exponential function and using the decay time\nconstant of that function, determined using a @A\ufb00 fit or maximum likelihood estimator, as the required\ndiscriminating parameter. The background rejection efficiency provided by this technique for high signal\nefficiency is not sufficient to permit the use of a cut-based Poisson analysis (as in a counting experiment)\nand so instead a @B\ufb00 fit to the data with the sum of a calibrated (with a gamma source) electron recoil\nbackground distribution and an assumed nuclear recoil signal distribution is performed. In the absence\nof a significant population of signal events the fitted normalisation of the nuclear recoil distribution is\nfound to be zero within errors. The magnitude of and error on this normalisation can then be interpreted\nin terms of a 90% CL upper limit on the nuclear recoil signal rate using (in this case) a Bayesian pre-\nscription. The ensemble of these limits (as a function of energy) can then be used in Step 2 (above) to\nset limits on WIMP mass and interaction cross-section (Fig. 3).\n84\n10\n-7\n10\n-6\n10\n-5\n10\n-4\n10\n-3\n10\n-2\n10 10 2 10 3\nC\n10 4\nWIMP mass, GeVD\nW\nIM\nP-\nnu\ncl\neo\nn \ncr\nos\ns-\nse\nct\nio\nn,\n p\nb\nFig. 3: 90% CL upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon interaction cross-section for spin-independent interactions (full line) ob-\ntained from analysis of NaIAD data using techniques described in the text [13]. The dotted curve corresponds to earlier NaI(Tl)\nlimits. The closed curve signifies the region favoured by the DAMA annual modulation analysis.\nOne open question relating directly to NaI(Tl) data arises from the fact that detailed analysis indi-\ncates that a gamma distribution rather than an exponential distribution provides the best approximation to\nthe scintillation pulse-shape. Preliminary work suggests that the additional degrees of freedom allowed\nby this function do not provide any improvement in electron recoil discrimination efficiency, with, in\nparticular, the finite rise-time of the pulse appearing to be independent of the type of recoil. Further\nstudy of this question is required however. Additional questions include whether it is possible to find an\nimproved technique for estimating the decay time constant E of the pulse in the presence of an unknown\nrate of noise photons, and whether the form of the distribution of decay time constants, which appears to\nbe better approximated by a log-normal (Fig. 4) or inverse gamma distribution rather than the expected\ngamma distribution in E , can be explained theoretically.\n85\n10\n-1\n1\n10\n10 2\nF\n100 200G 300H 400I 500J\nTime constant, ns\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf e\nve\nnt\ns\naK\n10\n-1\n1\n10\n10 2\nF\n10 3\nL\n100 200G 300H 400I 500J\nTime constant, ns\nN\num\nbe\nr o\nf e\nve\nnt\ns\nbM\nFig. 4: Distribution of scintillation decay time constants estimated from NaIAD electron recoil calibration (a) and data run\n(b) data using techniques described in the text [13]. In Figure (a) the data are well fitted by a single log-normal distribution\n(solid curve), providing motivation for log-normal fit to the run data shown in Figure (b). These data are well fitted by a sum of\ntwo log-normal distributions (of variable width) corresponding to signal and background populations (solid curve). The fitted\nnormalisation of the signal distribution is zero within errors indicating no evidence for signal events.\n5 CASE-STUDY 2: ZEPLIN 1\nThe ZEPLIN I detector [14] is a single phase liquid xenon scintillation detector of 3kg fiducial volume,\nviewed by three 3\u201d quartz photomultipliers through silica windows and optically isolated, self shielding,\nliquid xenon turrets. The target is enclosed by a multi-purpose, 1 tonne, PXE-based liquid scintillator\nshield and an outer passive lead shield. The liquid scintillator shield acts as a veto for PMT events\nand also provides a Compton electron recoil calibration contemporaneous with the data collected, an\nactive shield for external gammas, a high purity inner shield and, through the use of an optional internal\ngadolinium coated surface, a neutron monitor.\nAs in NaIAD, discrimination between nuclear recoil and electron recoil events is provided by the\ntime constant of the scintillation light from the target [15]. For nuclear recoils initiated by neutrons or\nWIMPs the scintillation has a characteristic decay time approximately 55% that of electron recoils above\n10 keV electron equivalent energy. The optimisation of the extraction of the nuclear recoil limit in Step 1\n(above) using this information remains the key statistical question within the ZEPLIN I analysis. Several\ndifferent estimation techniques have been applied to the scintillation pulses, including fitting routines\n86\nbased on single exponential fits, mean and median times. Although the time structure is well defined\nfor large events, the events of interest are measured in tens of photo-electrons for which the model\nindependent fits to the pulses provide similar results. The characteristic distribution of the scintillation\ntime constant estimators is a gamma distribution in N4\u0007\tE . As for NaIAD, the underlying process for the\ngeneration of this distribution in the photomultiplier signals is not well understood and needs further\nstudy.\nFollowing time constant estimation, Step 1 of the analysis proceeds by comparison of the estimator\ndistributions for the run data and electron recoil calibration data generated by gamma sources or known\ngamma backgrounds [16]. The latter is generated in ZEPLIN I through the use of the Compton veto signal\nwhere coincidental events in the chamber and veto are generated by high energy Compton scattered\ngammas from the photomultipliers. Should these estimator distributions have a relative shift in mean\nvalue, due either to the operating conditions of the target during calibrations or some spatial effect, then\nan appropriate normalisation must be applied to the calibration distributions. A @ \ufb00 analysis can then be\nused to compare the sum of electron and nuclear recoil calibration data with the run data to extract the\n90% CL upper limit on signal events. An alternative to the comparison with electron recoil calibration\ndata is to assume that the estimator distributions of the scintillation data are in fact well represented by\ntrue gamma distributions or, less stringently, smooth monotonically rising curves. An analysis can then\nbe performed by comparing the expected distribution for the sum of signal and background with the\nassumed functional form of the calibration data, or by searching for a gradient break in the monotonic\ndistribution. The validity of this comparison with the assumed functional form of the calibration data\nis in question when the underlying process for the generation of such a distribution is unknown. The\nrigour of the statistical tests utilised to extract the 90% CL upper limit on the nuclear recoil rate is of\nkey importance in present dark matter experiments due to the need to assess (in)compatability of cross-\nsection limits (Fig. 5) with the DAMA signal region (above).\nFig. 5: The preliminary WIMP-nucleon interaction cross-section - WIMP mass limit set by ZEPLIN I from 25 days live-time\ncompared to other direct dark matter detection experiments [17]. The full thick curve corresponds to the current ZEPLIN 1\n90% CL limit, while the dotted curve corresponds to the predicted sensitivity for eight months of data. The the three other\ncurves (from the bottom on the right hand side) are equivalent 90% CL upper limits set by the EDELWEISS, CDMS and IGEX\nexperiments respectively. The closed curve is the 4 O allowed region claimed by the DAMA collaboration using the predicted\nannual modulation signature.\n87\n6 CASE-STUDY 3: DRIFT\nThe UK Dark Matter Collaboration, together with LA Occidental and Temple Universities, is also de-\nveloping another class of detector (DRIFT) in which target density has been reduced to enable unprece-\ndented electron recoil discrimination efficiency to be obtained. A prototype detector (DRIFT-1) is cur-\nrently operating at Boulby Mine and consists of a TPC containing \u0002 200 g of low pressure (40 Torr)\nCS\n\ufb00\ngas read-out with two high granularity MWPCs [18]. Charge generated by recoil events attaches to\nthe electronegative CS\n\ufb00\ngas molecules forming CS P\n\ufb00\nions. The high mass of these ions limits transverse\ndiffusion to\n\u0003\n1 mm over drift distances in excess of 1 m and this, together with the excellent position\nresolution of the read-out plane, permits efficient discrimination between nuclear and electron recoils on\nthe basis of measured track length. In addition to this benefit however, the technique allows the direction\nof candidate nuclear recoils to be determined. This is important because the rotation of the earth upon\nits axis causes the mean velocity relative to the detector of incident WIMPs, and hence WIMP-induced\nnuclear recoils, to modulate diurnally through \u0002 90 Q . Directional information can therefore be used to\npositively identify a potential nuclear recoil signal as being due to WIMP- scattering.\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n|cos (gamma)|\nCo\nun\nts\nFig. 6: Angular distribution of simulated nuclear recoil signal events in the DRIFT detector. RTSVU\u0015WYX\u0006Z = 1 corresponds to recoils\npointing in the same direction as the mean expected WIMP flux vector. An anisotropy is evident at 90 % CL (KS test statistic)\nfor 30 signal events. Figure taken from [19].\n88\nAt present it is intended that directional information will only be used once a signal has been\nseen, with, for instance, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic being used to test whether the distribution\nin a suitable angular variable of events passing track length cuts is consistent with a uniform parent\ndistribution characteristic of background (Fig. 6). An open question remains however regarding whether\nthe information contained in this directional variable, together with track length and energy information\ncan be used in a multi-variate analysis to significantly improve detector sensitivity. Such an analysis\nwould undoubtedly be complicated by dependency of the directional discriminating parameters on the\nWIMP model, thereby preventing factorisation of the problem into two steps as discussed above. It is\nhoped however that demonstrable improvements may nevertheless be obtainable with the application of\na suitable multi-variate technique.\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nDirect detection dark matter experiments offer unique challenges to experimentalists seeking to use ad-\nvanced statistical techniques to advance our fundamental understanding of the universe. Beyond the\nusual issues relating to limit setting and the definition of rigorous confidence regions (which are com-\nmon to many experiments) these experiments require novel approaches to parameter estimation from\nnoisy data, multi-variate analyses in the presence of imperfectly known background distributions and\nmany other techniques. It is hoped that a better understanding of at least some of these issues will lead\nto considerable improvements in detector sensitivity in the near future.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to acknowledge PPARC for providing financial support.\nReferences\n[1] G.
