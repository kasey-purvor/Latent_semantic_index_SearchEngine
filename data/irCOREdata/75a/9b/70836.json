(2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 2 \nAnalogical reasoning entails the use of \u2018source\u2019 information from a previous problem-\nsolving episode as a means to facilitate attempts at solving a current, \u2018target\u2019 problem. \nTheorists have traditionally viewed analogical reasoning as a core element of \nintelligent thought\n1,2\n, and recent evidence suggests that analogising may play a \nparticularly central role in creative problem solving\n3\n and domain-based skill \nacquisition\n4,5\n. In spite of the vital function that is claimed for analogical reasoning in \ninnovative thinking and the development of expertise, little existing research appears \nto have given serious attention to the nature, quantity and function of analogising in \ndesign contexts. This is, perhaps, more than a little surprising, as design tasks are not \nonly ubiquitous in many professional work endeavours\n6\n but they are also commonly \nviewed as prototypical cases of complex and ill-defined problems of the kind whose \nsolution should benefit from the application of prior domain-specific knowledge\n8,9\n. \n \nGiven the limited amount of existing work on analogical processes in design, the \npresent research aimed to tackle head-on some of the key issues relating to designers\u2019 \nuse of prior knowledge, and the links between analogising and expertise. Our main \nfocus was to address three pivotal and interrelated questions: (1) What evidence is \nthere that designers are able spontaneously to invoke and apply prior analogues when \ntackling their current design problems or sub-problems?; (2) What comparisons can \nbe drawn between the kinds of analogising evidenced by expert design practitioners \nand the kinds of analogising arising in the problem-solving efforts of novice designers \nwho possess only a few years of practical design experience?; and (3) What types of \navailable cues drive a designer\u2019s search for, and application of, analogous source \nproblems and solutions? \n \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 3 \nIn order to address these issues in the present paper we initially undertake a review of \nthe psychological literature on analogical problem solving with a view to identifying \nkey observations concerning the use of analogical reasoning as a fundamental \nproblem-solving procedure in domain experts and novices. A critical aspect of this \nreview is to assess how distinct forms of analogical reasoning may differentially \ndominate expert and novice performance in domain-based problem-solving tasks, \nincluding design tasks. In relation to experts, for example, we develop the proposal \nthat performance will be characterised by more schema-driven analogising (applied to \nhighly familiar domain problems) and less case-driven analogising (applied to less \nfamiliar domain problems). As far as novices are concerned, however, we predict the \nreverse pattern of observations, as novices simply will not possess much in the way of \nschematised domain knowledge derived from extensive prior experience. \n \nWe discuss the notions of schema-driven and case-driven analogising in more detail \nbelow. Suffice it to say for now that we use the term \u2018schema\u2019 in its conventional \nsense (as espoused, for example, by Chi, Feltovich and Glaser\n9\n) to denote an abstract \nknowledge structure, developed through extensive domain-based experience, that can \nfunction automatically to recognise a class of problems and to afford an appropriate \nsolution procedure. As such, what we describe as \u2018schema-driven analogising\u2019 entails \nthe rapid, automatic, and implicit identification and application of abstract \nexperiential knowledge that is relevant to the task at hand. In contrast, what we term \n\u2018case-driven analogising\u2019 aims to capture the idea that analogising may sometimes \ninvolve the strategic identification of a concrete prior problem whose solution can be \nmapped systematically onto the current problem. Our concept of case-driven \nanalogising has direct counterparts in the literature on so-called \u2018case-based \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 4 \nreasoning\u2019\n10\n and is clearly oppositional to schema-driven analogising in that it entails \nrelatively slow, effortful and explicit analogical-reasoning processes involving \ncontentful rather abstracted knowledge. \n \nOur literature review focuses primarily on laboratory-based experiments of analogical \nproblem solving, as these have been the mainstay of existing research in this area. \nSome recent real-world studies of analogical reasoning have, however, been \nconducted, and typically generalise laboratory-derived findings to professional \nproblem-solving contexts\n11-13\n. In addition, it should be noted that most of the research \nthat we discuss is, of necessity, non-design focused, although where we are aware of \npertinent design-oriented analyses of analogical reasoning we introduce this material \ninto the review. Subsequent to our examination of the literature we report on a small-\nscale study that we have recently conducted that was directed at eliciting a \ncomparative understanding of expert versus novice analogising in industrial design. \nOur experts were company-based engineers with extensive commercial design \nexperience. Our novices were masters-level students who had been involved in design \nand development projects as part of their undergraduate and graduate work, including \nperiods of company-based placement. \n \n1 Empirical studies of analogical reasoning in problem solving \n1.1 The spontaneous use of analogies  \nIn spite of the postulated importance of analogical reasoning for intelligent human \nbehaviour, studies conducted over the past twenty years or so have suggested that the \nspontaneous consideration of analogies in problem solving may be rather limited in its \noccurrence. For example, pioneering experiments by Gick and Holyoak\n14,15\n \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 5 \ndemonstrated that providing participants with a source analogue prior to them tackling \na superficially different but conceptually similar target problem gave little or no gain \nover baseline solution rates where no analogue had previously been presented. It was \nonly in those conditions where explicit hints were provided about the relevance of the \nsource information to the target problem that good levels of facilitated target \nperformance arose (see also Anoli et al.\n16\n). Casakin and Goldschmidt\n17\n have similarly \ndemonstrated how, in the design domain, both novices and experts can make effective \nuse of visual analogies for current design work when explicitly directed to do so, but \nare more limited in their spontaneous use of such visual analogies. Other studies have \nclarified that the transfer of an analogous solution in the absence of directive hints is \nalso not improved by factors such as: (1) giving participants a static diagrammatic \nrepresentation of the underlying solution-structure associated with the base \nproblem\n15,18\n; (2) providing problem solvers with an abstract verbal statement \nsummarising the underlying conceptual nature of the base problem and solution\n15\n; or \n(3) re-presenting the source information to the participant whilst they are actually \nprocessing the target\n14,16\n. Taken together, this evidence has been viewed by some \ntheorists as support for the contention that whilst people are very good at utilising \nprior problem and solution information when they are directed to do so, they may be \nrather poor at detecting such analogous information under unprompted conditions.  \n \nSome studies, however, have produced more positive evidence for the spontaneous \nuse of analogies by problem solvers. For example, Holyoak and Koh\n19\n and Keane\n20\n \nhave demonstrated that people are readily able to notice and make use of prior \nanalogues when there are high levels of surface similarity in the information content \nof the source and target problems. This latter situation arguably maps more closely on \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 6 \nto much real-world problem solving, where \u2018within-domain\u2019 analogies involving close \nvariants of a target problem are likely to be available. For example, if an industrial \ndesigner is tackling an information-display problem, say a design for a gas-meter \nread-out, then they may well bring to mind previous design experience relating to \nother displays that they have worked on in the past\u2014perhaps relating to an electricity \nmeter, a fuel gauge or a seismic indicator. Indeed, Visser\n21\n presents compelling \nevidence for the spontaneous application of within-domain analogies by an individual \nexpert designer tackling an unfamiliar design problem (see Cross, Christiaans and \nDorst\n22\n for a full report of this designer\u2019s activity, which was analysed as part of the \nDelft Protocols Workshop on design). At a theoretical level, Sweller\n23\n has argued that \nmuch of the time there is a strong correlation between the surface features of \nproblems and their underlying, abstract solution structures. Therefore, relying on \nsurface features to access what might be a relevant source problem may often be a \nvaluable heuristic\n24\n, and one that the human cognitive system may well have evolved \nto operate. As a heuristic, however, it is likely to be far from foolproof, and may, on \noccasions, lead to attempts to map between source and target problems that, whilst \nappearing to be superficially similar at a surface level, in fact have no underlying \nconceptual association in terms of their solution structures (e.g., see Novick\n25\n for \nrelevant evidence). \n   \n1.2  Analogical reasoning and expertise \nApart from the role of surface similarity in driving spontaneous analogical reasoning, \nother research has provided evidence for unprompted analogising when multiple \nanalogous sources are presented prior to the target problem, even when these sources \nshare no surface similarities to the target\n15,26\n. This line of research is particularly \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 7 \ninteresting as it suggests that the primary mechanism underpinning the development \nof domain-based expertise may well be analogical reasoning. The essential claim of \ntheorists taking this position\n4,15,24\n is that repeated exposure to within-domain problems \n(or what Dunbar and Blanchette\n27\n refer to as \u2018local\u2019 analogies) serves to promote the \ninduction of generalised knowledge schemas. As we noted previously, such schemas \nembody an abstract conceptual understanding of the underlying nature of problems, \nand serve to enable the recognition of problem \u2018types\u2019; they also embody a procedural \nunderstanding of how best to solve problems of that particular type.  \n \nAttempts at explaining fully the processes of schema acquisition and schema \napplication have fuelled much of the psychological literature on expert-novice \ndifferences over the past few decades. Central within this literature has been the view \nthat the correct perception of a problem by an expert will automatically cue access to \nan appropriate schema and the immediate invocation of a straightforward\u2014even \nstereotypical\u2014solution method\n9\n (see also Klein\u2019s\n28\n view of expertise as involving \n\u2018recognition-primed\u2019 decision making). In contrast to experts, novices will have had \nlimited opportunities to induce problem-solving schemas in a particular domain, such \nthat they will frequently be unable to identify an appropriate schema for a given task. \nFaced with no available schema-based solution knowledge, novices will often have to \nrely on the heuristic of attempting to find a source analogue that shares surface \nsimilarities to the task at hand and that may have solution properties that can map \nsuccessfully to the target. This is the process that we referred to above as case-driven \nanalogising. It comes as little surprise, then, that novice problem solvers who have to \ndefault to this kind of strategy are typically seen to have difficulty in correctly \ncategorising domain-based problems and deriving appropriate solutions for them\n9\n. \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 8 \n \nSchema-based views of expertise have also been applied to the design domain, and \nhave received some support as a way of characterising expert-novice differences in \nthe areas of software design\n29\n, architecture\n30\n, and engineering design\n31\n. More recently, \nBall et al.\n32\n have gone as far as to argue that a fair proportion of expert designers\u2019 \nproblem solving knowledge may be viewed as fairly \u2018routine\u2019 in nature, in that \nfamiliar kinds of problem will often have readily retrievable solutions or well-\nestablished \u2018precedents\u2019\n33\n that are known to be effective. Still, a non-trivial proportion \nof design work, even for experts, is likely to involve tackling fairly non-routine \nproblems, where highly schematised knowledge that has been induced from prior \nexperience is simply not available. With such non-routine problems, the explicit \nsearch for some form of source analogue may (as in the novice case) prove to be the \nbest strategy to use to facilitate a degree of progress in effecting a design solution. \nThus, with non-routine aspects of design problems, both experts and novices should \nbe seen to attempt case-driven analogising that will primarily be cued by surface-level \nassociations between the target and available source cases. These theoretical \nspeculations, however, require empirical assessment, and a major aspect of the study \nreported below was to evaluate such ideas experimentally. Before we progress to a \ndescription of our study we first reiterate, for the sake of clarity, the detailed \npredictions that underpinned our research.     \n \n2 Experimental predictions \nOur examination of the literature on analogical reasoning and domain-based expertise \nenabled the derivation of two key predictions concerning expert-novice differences in \nthe nature of analogising in design. \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 9 \n \nPrediction 1 was that experts would show more evidence of analogical reasoning than \nnovices when measures of analogising were collapsed over the schema-driven and \ncase-driven categories. This increase in expert analogising over novice levels was \nexpected because experienced designers should possess vastly more knowledge of \nprior design problems and solutions that would have some bearing on the current \nproblem-solving effort. Support for this prediction would arise as a main effect of \nlevel of expertise (i.e., expert vs. novice) in relation to observed levels of analogising \noccurring during design activity. \n \nPrediction 2 was that expert design behaviour would be characterised by the presence \nof more schema-driven analogising than case-driven analogising, since, for experts, \nmore domain-based problems should fall toward the familiar end of the familiar-\nunfamiliar continuum, and less toward the unfamiliar end. In the case of novices, \nhowever, the opposite pattern of schema-driven and case-driven analogising was \nexpected to prevail, that is, less schema-driven analogising and more case driven \nanalogising. This is because most problems would have limited familiarity to novices \nand would need to be approached using explicit, case-based reasoning. This prediction \nwould show up in measures of analogising as an interaction between level of \nexpertise (expert vs. novice) and form of analogising (schema-driven vs. case-driven). \n \nIt should be noted that for the purposes of the present paper we did not pursue any \nanalyses of the \u2018quality\u2019 of analogising. Although it may be possible to derive relevant \n(and, no doubt, theoretically interesting) predictions about such qualitative aspects of \nanalogical reasoning in expert and novice design, such issues are some way off our \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 10 \npresent focus on the differential forms and extent of analogising arising at distinct \nlevels of design expertise.  \n \n3 Method \n3.1 Participants \nEight expert designers and eight novice designers were recruited to participate in our \nstudy. The experts were all company-based engineers with a minimum of seven years \nof academic and commercial design experience (mean experience = 15.1 years). The \nnovices were masters-level engineering students who had been involved in a limited \nnumber of design and development projects as part of their undergraduate and \ngraduate work, including periods of company-based placement, occasionally up to a \nfull year in duration. The mean amount of design experience of these student \ndesigners was 3.5 years. Although, in line with standard terminology, we use the term \n\u2018novice\u2019 to refer to our masters-level participants, it is important to acknowledge that \nthese designers were some way along the continuum of design training, being more \nadvanced than typical undergraduate designers but clearly more limited in their range \nof prior experience when compared to our company-based expert group. All \nparticipants were paid \u00a315 for their involvement in the experiment. \n \n3.2 Task \nAll participants received an identical brief that related to the design of an automated \ncar-rental facility. This brief was designed to be complex, multifaceted and ill-defined \nin the traditional sense of a prototypical design problem (cf. Goel and Pirolli\n6\n), but \ntractable enough to be tackled to a satisfactory level by designers with only a few \nyears of design experience. The brief requested a focus on product conceptualisation \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 11 \nrather than detailed design, and necessitated that consideration be given to system \ninputs and outputs as well as constraints relating to usability, security, efficiency and \nthe like. The car-rental problem read as follows: \n \nWe would like you to come up with a product design concept for an \nAutomated Rent-a-Car facility. The basic idea is that a national car \nrental agency has decided to improve the accessibility of their \nfacilities to enable 24 hour availability for reservation of cars, and \ncollection and return of keys. The vision is for a stand-alone, outdoor \nsystem that fulfils the following criteria: (1) Enables reservation \nfacilities by means of a keyboard interface; (2) Allows payment by \ncredit card for deposit and final settlement; (3) Provides receipt of \npayment; (4) Checks driving licence details based on a new DVLA \nsmart-card; (5) Arranges insurance cover; (6) Enables driver feedback \non the external state of car prior to completion of the transaction; and \n(7) Dispenses keys and accepts return of keys. Your design work \nshould be primarily focussed on the product concept and related issues \n(such as the external structure and appearance of the facility). Once \nthe concept has been finalised the actual mechanics of the system \n(including software and hardware aspects) will become the concern of \nanother design group that you would have input to. \n \n3.3 Experimental  design \nThe experiment involved a 2x2 mixed between-within participants design. The \nbetween-participants factor was Level of Expertise, with two levels (expert vs. \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 12 \nnovice), and the within-participants factor was Form of Analogising, with two levels \n(schema-driven vs. case-driven). The dependent measure in this study was the rate of \ndifferent types of analogising observed during a participant\u2019s design work. \n \n3.4 Procedure \nEach participant was tested individually in a quiet setting. During their design session, \nthe participant was asked to take one hour to complete a conceptual design solution \nthat would meet the given brief as well as possible. Participants were free to make \nnotes and to draw sketches as part of their design activity. Each participant was also \nasked to produce a concurrent think-aloud verbalisation during their design work, and \nwas told that the experimenter was interested in capturing the initial phase of their \ntypical design activity. If participants fell silent for more than five seconds they were \nprompted to try to keep thinking aloud. Verbalisations were recorded using a tape \nmachine and all pen-and-paper work was recoded by means of a tripod-mounted \nvideo-camera. \n \n3.5 Protocol coding \nAll participants produced highly articulate think-aloud protocols. Transcripts of these \nprotocols were coded by the first author for all instances of schema-driven or case-\ndriven analogising. Any repetitions or elaborations of the application of schema-based \nor case-based analogies were also coded as long as they were temporally separated \nfrom the original analogising episode with at least one different instance of \nanalogising intervening between the original episode and the repetition or elaboration \nof the original analogy. All transcripts were coded blind as to the designer\u2019s level of \nexpertise. Reliability checks on the protocol coding were not pursued, and it is, \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 13 \ntherefore, important to treat the present research findings with a concomitant degree \nof caution. It is noteworthy, however, that an application of a similar coding scheme \nby the authors to capture aspects of analogising in business-management protocols \nproduced very high levels of inter-coder reliability (see Bearman et al.\n11\n). \n \n3.5.1 Coding of schema-driven analogising \nIn terms of the criteria underpinning the application of codes to protocol segments, it \nshould be noted that we formally defined schema-driven analogising as arising when a \ndesign problem was recognised as being of a particular kind that could be solved with \na known type of solution approach. For example, one of our experts stated early on in \nhis design work that \u201cI\u2019ve designed outdoor terminals before, so, straight away, I\u2019m \nthinking about how this relates to my knowledge of what I\u2019ve done before\u2026\u201d. This \ndesigner then progressed toward the conceptualisation of the overall task in terms of \nfamiliar \u2018principles\u2019 associated with the design of outdoor terminals, including generic \nfactors that cut across the details of specific exemplars of such terminals such as \nweather-proofing, security, and the provision of cabling.  \n \nAnother example of schema-driven analogising arose when one of our participants \nwas working on the problem of how to position the screen-based interface within the \nrent-a-car facility. He immediately stated that \u201cI know from experience that having a \nlow, angled interface is the easiest thing to achieve, as tall people can look down, and \nshorter people don\u2019t have to try to access something that\u2019s too high for them. So we\u2019re \nlooking for something with an angled display face\u201d. In this example, the designer was \nrapidly seen to conceptualise the positioning of the screen in terms of familiar \nprinciples associated with the design of accessible interfaces for outdoor terminals. \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 14 \n \nAn important aspect of schema-driven analogising that was apparent in our data (and \nwhich can be seen to some extent in the example above) is that such analogising \ntended to entail a seamless process involving the mapping of the abstract, schema-\nbased solution onto the concrete details of the current problem. So for example, whilst \nthe previous schema incorporates the abstract notion of some kind of \u2018interface\u2019, in \nthe actual design of the rent-a-car facility this generic concept of an interface may be \ninstantiated as a specific kind of screen display (e.g., a touch-screen).  \n \n3.5.2 Coding of case-driven analogising \nIn contrast to schema-driven analogising, we formally coded protocol segments as \ninstances of case-driven analogising when a design problem was recognised as being \nsimilar to one or more specific \u2018instances\u2019 of a problem or situation that had been \nencountered on a prior occasion, and was solved with reference to such similarities. \nFor example, one of our participants stated that \u201cI\u2019m thinking immediately back here \nto a ticket machine that we worked on, where an external consultant came up with the \nidea of a rotary wheel for scrolling through the screen options\u201d. Here the designer was \ndrawing an explicit link between the current design task (i.e., to decide on a device for \nscrolling through and selecting a screen item) and an analogous problem and its \nsolution. \n \nA central aspect of case-driven analogising that was evident in our design protocols \nwas that it invariably involved a systematic process of mapping from elements of the \nsource problem and solution in order to effect a solution to the target problem. So for \nexample, one designer drew an association between the way credit-card bookings can \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 15 \ntake place for cinema tickets and a potential solution for the problem of making an \nadvanced car reservation. Using this source analogy the designer explicitly mapped \nthe idea of telephoning the cinema with card details and then using an automated \nticket machine on arrival at the cinema onto the concept of making a car-reservation \nvia the telephone and then using a credit card to obtain the car-keys on arrival at the \nrent-a-car facility. Another example of case-driven analogising that illustrates this \nmapping process arose when one of our experts speculated on a possible design for a \nmechatronic system to handle car keys within the rent-a-car facility. He described the \npossibility of using a piece of robotics  \u201c\u2026like one of those laundry automation set-\nups where you go to collect your suit from the cleaners and there\u2019s a robot \u2013 you just \nfeed in a card and it runs along and picks up your piece of cleaning\u2026\u201d. He mapped \nthis source solution to the key-handling problem by stating that \u201c\u2026you might imagine \nthat the keys hang on a series of little pegs by this, inside some, some cupboard, and \ninside it\u2019s got some tiny robot that goes dodododododo and picks this key off and then \nbrings it back and then drops it down a chute\u2026\u201d.  \n \n4 Results and discussion \nCoded protocols were processed further in order to extract frequency counts for each \nindividual designer of the occurrence of discrete instances of schema-driven \nanalogising and case-driven analogising. Individual scores on each of these measures \nwere then adjusted to take account of the exact amount of time that the designer had \ntaken over their design session (i.e., although designers were requested to complete \ntheir design work within an hour, some took marginally shorter or longer amounts of \ntime than this, with the range of total design time being from 40 minutes at a \nminimum to 75 minutes at a maximum). Adjusting frequency counts of schema-\nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 16 \ndriven and case-driven analogising to take account of such individual differences in \ntime-on-task simply entailed computing, for each designer, an estimate of the rate of \neach type of analogising per hour of design time. Mean data resulting from these \nadjustments are presented in Table 1. \n \nFrom Table 1 it can be seen that the mean rate of analogising was greater for experts \nthan for novices (32.2 vs. 22.9 analogies per hour). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) \nrevealed that this expert-novice difference in analogising was statistically reliable, \nF(1, 14) = 5.04, p = .041. This finding supports Prediction 1, that is, that experts \nshould show greater evidence of analogical reasoning than novices, irrespective of \nwhether such analogising is schema-driven or case-driven in form. This prediction \nderived from our assumption that experts possess vastly more knowledge than novices \nof prior design problems and solutions that should have some use for the current \nproblem-solving effort. \n \n***Table 1 about here*** \n \nTable 1 also indicates that schema-driven analogising was more prevalent in the \npresent designers\u2019 work than was case driven analogising (34.8 schema-driven \nanalogies per hour vs. 20.3 case-driven analogies per hour). This main effect of Form \nof Analogising was highly reliable, F(1, 14) = 31.24, p < .001. Although we did not \nspecify any a priori prediction concerning the overall rates of schema-driven versus \ncase-driven analogising, it is clear from Table 1 that this effect results from the \ndominant role that schema-driven analogising plays in expert design practice in the \npresent design context. Indeed, any detailed theoretical assessment of our findings \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 17 \nneeds to take account of the fact that our data analysis revealed a highly significant \ncross-over interaction between Level of Expertise and Form of Analogising, F(1, 14) \n= 111.33, p < .001. This interaction was as expected under Prediction 2, that is, that \nexpert design behaviour would be characterised by the presence of more schema-\ndriven analogising than case-driven analogising, since, for experts, more domain-\nbased problems should be familiar and have known types or categories of solution \npossibilities that have been abstracted from extensive domain-based experience. For \nnovices, however, the opposite pattern of schema-driven and case-driven analogising \nwas expected to arise, that is, less schema-driven analogising and more case-driven \nanalogising. This is because most problems would have only limited familiarity to \nnovices and would, therefore, need to be attempted using explicit and concrete forms \nof case-based reasoning. The data depicted in Table 1 are very much in line with these \nassumptions about expert-novice differences in design-based analogising. \n \nA final aspect of our data that is also worth mentioning is that a majority of the case-\ndriven analogising that we identified in both the expert and the novice protocols \nappeared to be dominated by the use of surface-level cues available in the target \nproblem, as opposed to more abstract cues associated with the underlying structure of \nthe target. This informal observation lends some support to the theoretical ideas that \nwe outlined in our introductory review of the analogising literature which suggest that \nsurface similarity between target and source problems is particularly crucial in \npromoting spontaneous analogical reasoning\n23,24\n.  \n \n \n \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 18 \n5 Conclusions \nIn this paper we set out to investigate the extent and nature of spontaneous analogical \nreasoning associated with novice and expert design activity. In terms of theories of \ndesign problem-solving and expert cognition, we believe that our results are important \nin three main respects. \n \nFirst, they demonstrate the prevalence of spontaneous analogising in both expert and \nnovice design practice. This finding corroborates the widely-held assumption that \nanalogising plays a fundamental role in creative, real-world problem solving\n3\n. It \nwould appear that analogising is part of the natural behavioural repertoire of industrial \ndesigners, and is a form of reasoning that can flourish without directive hints from the \nexperimenter that explicitly request the reuse of prior knowledge and experience.  \n \nSecond, our findings clarify that expert designers exhibit more schema-driven \nanalogising than case-driven analogising, whilst novices show the reverse pattern of \nanalogy use. This supports existing theories of domain-based expertise\n4,9\n which \nsuggest that a critical aspect of skill acquisition is a move from initial reliance on \nspecific, concrete episodes of prior domain experience toward the application of \nhighly schematised knowledge structures based on the automatic recognition of \nfamiliar types or categories of problems and solutions. Of course, the novice-level \napplication of specific cases to current design tasks is a vital and necessary aspect of \nthe whole process of knowledge schematisation that eventually leads to expert-levels \nof skilled design work. Our data also indicate, however, that the use of case-driven \ndesign is still an important aspect of expert behaviour. This reveals that even experts \ndesigners with many years of professional domain-based experience will find \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J. (2004). Spontaneous analogising in engineering design: A \ncomparative analysis of experts and novices. Design Studies, 25, 495-508. \nPage 19 \nnumerous aspects of design problems unfamiliar and resistant to schema-based \nprocessing. Indeed design problems are notorious for possessing nuances and \ncomplexities that can, on occasions, render the use of routine solutions ineffective. \nWhen schematised knowledge cannot be applied then experts seem to be readily \ncapable of defaulting to the use of case-based experience in order to progress their \nproblem-solving activity. \n \nThird, our data suggest that the numerous instances of case-driven analogising that are \nevidenced by expert and novice designers are dominated by the use of surface-level \ncues available in the target problem, as opposed to more abstract cues associated with \nthe target\u2019s underlying problem structure. This latter, anecdotal observation \nsubstantiates theoretical ideas that we outlined in our introductory review of the \nanalogising literature, which suggest that surface similarity between target and source \nproblems is particularly crucial in promoting spontaneous analogical reasoning\n23,24\n. \nFurther research on case-based analogising in design would benefit from a formal \napproach to examining the relative role of surface-level details and deep-level \nabstractions in promoting the search for source analogues and the mapping between \nsuch source information and target problems. As Visser\n21\n notes, however, defining \nprecisely what constitute surface-level and abstract similarities between design \nproblems is likely to be a non-trivial matter. \nBall, L.J., Ormerod, T.C., & Morley, N.J.
