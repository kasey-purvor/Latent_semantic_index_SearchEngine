INTRODUCTION\nRARE-EARTH-DOPED fiber lasers demonstrate an excel-lent combination of high efficiency and high spatial beam\nquality, which makes them attractive compared to conven-\ntional solid-state lasers. For high-power fiber laser applications\n(e.g., printing, free-space communication), Ytterbium-doping\nresults in a very efficient lasing transition with broad emission\nand absorption bands, allowing various pumping schemes and\na wide tuning range of the laser wavelength. Furthermore, the\nsimple two-level energy manifold structure of the Yb3+ ion\nmakes it relatively free of concentration quenching, allowing\nshorter fiber lasers with reduced nonlinearities. These excellent\nfeatures have led to the realization of high-power cladding-\npumped Yb3+-doped fiber lasers (YDFL) [1]\u2013[3].\nIt is possible to increase further the output power, and extend\nthe pumping schemes of YDFLs by using several wavelength\nmultiplexed diode lasers as the pump source. To this end,\nNd3+-Yb3+ glass is doped with both the Nd3+ and Yb3+\nions, which allows pumping the Yb3+ ions indirectly through\na nonradiative energy transfer from the Nd3+ ions [4], [5].\nFurthermore, both Nd3+ and Yb3+ emit in the wavelength\nrange of \u223c 1 \u00b5m, and thus the output power from cladding-\npumped Nd3+-Yb3+ codoped fiber lasers (NYDFL) can be\nManuscript received April 27, 2005; revised October 18, 2005.

In order to achieve such\nhigh output powers without reaching the threshold of nonlinear\neffects, the dimensions of the fiber core must be increased and\nthe fiber becomes intrinsically multimode [8]. Bending losses\ncan be applied to discriminate the fundamental LP01 mode from\nhigher order modes so that the laser output becomes practically\nsingle mode [9].\nPrevious works that model high-power rare-earth-doped fiber\nlasers have been limited to single-ion systems, such as Nd3+ or\nYb3+ [10] or other codoped systems, e.g., Er3+-Yb3+ [11]. Our\ngoal here is to extend these works and to demonstrate models of\nNYDFLs based on numerical calculations of detailed coupled\nrate-propagation equations. Our model takes into account the\nenergy transfer between Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions, cross relaxation\namong Nd3+ ions, Nd3+ clustering effects, spectrally resolved\namplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions,\nand scattering losses. Our model also accounts approximately\nfor contribution of high-order modes to the ASE. We also\npresent a quasi-analytical model to approximate the exact equa-\ntions. Nonlinear effects (e.g., stimulated Brillouin scattering,\nself-phase modulation), however, are disregarded in the present\ncalculations.\nThe structure of this contribution is the following. In\nSection II, we describe the set of coupled rate-propagation\nequations for the Nd3+-Yb3+ system. The approximate quasi-\nanalytical solutions are described in Section III. In Section IV,\nwe consider some numerical examples for cladding-pumped\nhigh-power NYDFLs. In particular, we discuss the effects of\nseveral key design parameters (e.g., the pump power, fiber\nlength, pump configuration, pump wavelengths, output mir-\nror reflectivity, laser wavelength, and the Nd3+ and Yb3+\nconcentrations) on the laser output power and efficiency. We\nalso demonstrate the effect of Nd3+ clustering on the laser\nperformance, and compare the approximate solutions of the\nquasi-analytical model to the exact numerical solutions. Finally,\nconclusions are given in Section V. The main derivation steps\nof the approximate solution are described in the Appendix.\nII. THEORETICAL MODEL\nWe assume a double-clad fiber laser of length L with dis-\ntributed Bragg reflector (DBR) mirrors at either side. The\nwavelength-dependent power reflectivities of the DBR mirrors\nare R1(\u03bb) and R2(\u03bb) at z = 0 and z = L, respectively. The\npump power P\u00b1p (z, t) at the wavelength \u03bbp is injected into the\nfirst cladding either at z = 0 or at z = L, where the positive\nor negative superscripts denote propagation in the forward or\nbackward z-direction, respectively.

The value of \u0393p can be higher than the ratio of the\ncore area (Acore) to the combined area of the core and the first\ncladding (Aclad), due to the increased pump absorption in a\nbent fiber [12], [13]. The spectral power density of the light\nthat propagates in the laser cavity is denoted P\u00b1(z, t, \u03bb), with\na wavelength-dependent power filling factor \u0393(\u03bb). We assume\nthat \u0393(\u03bb) is given by the ratio of the multimode power that is\nguided and amplified in the core to the total power propagating\nin the fiber. We also assume that unguided radiation modes can\nbe neglected, and that the contribution to the amplified power\nin the core from interference of guided modes is insignificantly\nsmall for practical values of the fiber V-number [14]. Under\nthese assumptions, an approximate expression for the power\nfilling factor \u0393(\u03bb) can be derived based on [15], namely\n\u0393(\u03bb) \u0003\n\u2211\n\u03b7 |u\u03b7(\u03bb)|2 \u0393\u03b7(\u03bb)I\u03b7g\u03b7\u2211\n\u03b7 |u\u03b7(\u03bb)|2 I\u03b7g\u03b7\n. (1)\nHere, \u0393\u03b7(\u03bb) is the modal power filling factor, u\u03b7(\u03bb) is the\nmodal coefficient in the expansion of the total field in terms\nof the guided transverse modes, and \u03b7 is the modal index\n(i.e., \u03b7 = 1 corresponds to the fundamental LP01 mode). Thus,\n|u\u03b7(\u03bb)|2 is proportional to the power carried by the mode \u03b7,\nand can in principle also depend on the spatial coordinate z\n(due to, e.g., mode coupling). Other parameters in (1) are the\nmodal degeneracy value g\u03b7 [16] and the modal normalization\nI\u03b7 that is proportional to an integral of the modal envelope over\nan infinite cross section [15]. An approximate expression for\n\u0393\u03b7(\u03bb) of the fundamental and higher order LP modes is given\nin [15]. In what follows, we assume that due to specialized\nfiber coiling techniques most of the higher order modes are\npractically suppressed [7]. It is therefore sufficient to include\nonly the first two guided modes in (1), i.e., the LP01 and\nLP11 modes.\nWe assume that the Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions are uniformly\ndoped over the core cross section with concentrations NNd and\nNYb, respectively. Our model includes forward and backward\nenergy transfer between Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions, cross relax-\nation of Nd3+ ions, and Nd3+ and Yb3+ single-ion transitions\n(cf. Fig. 1). We note that unlike the Er3+-Yb3+ codoped sys-\ntem, where the main energy-transfer channel is from the Yb3+\nions to the Er3+ acceptors [17], here, the Yb3+ ions are the\nenergy acceptors from the Nd3+ donors. It is assumed that the\nYb3+ ions are coupled with Nd3+ ions through a dipole\u2013dipole\ntype interaction process [4]. However, some of the Nd3+ ions\ncan form clusters, in particular in high Nd3+ concentration\nfibers [18], [19], and these clustered Nd3+ are not coupled to\nthe Yb3+ ions. In a Nd3+ cluster, the cross-relaxation interac-\ntion of the Nd3+ ions is accelerated since the average distance\nbetween Nd3+ ions is relatively short [19]. We also assume that\nthe populations of the manifolds 4I15\/2, 4I13\/2, and 4I11\/2 are\nvirtually empty, due to the fast nonradiative transition times\nof these levels. Therefore, we impose N3 = N2 = N1 \u0003 0\n(and equivalently N\u00af3 = N\u00af2 = N\u00af1 \u0003 0 for the clustered popula-\ntions; cf. Fig. 1). The pump photons are absorbed by the Nd3+\nFig. 1.

Pump photons are also absorbed by the Yb3+ ions in the\nground manifold 2F7\/2, exciting them to the manifold 2F5\/2.\nLosses to the 4F3\/2 state by excited state absorption (ESA) of\npump photons or by upconversion to higher level manifolds are\nneglected due to the small population of this manifold.

Note that the conservation rela-\ntions (1\u2212 k)NNd = N0(z, t) +N4(z, t), kNNd = N\u00af0(z, t) +\nN\u00af4(z, t), and NYb = N5(z, t) +N6(z, t) were used to elim-\ninate N0(z, t), N\u00af0(z, t), and N5(z, t) from (2)\u2013(4). The for-\nward and backward cross-relaxation coefficients are given by\nR45 and R60, respectively. We employ the Forster\u2013Dexter\nmodel [20] for dipole\u2013dipole interactions in order to estimate\nthe value of these coefficients in Nd3+-Yb3+ codoped glass\n(see, e.g., [5]). Assuming nearest neighbor interactions, R45 is\nestimated from [21]\nR45 \u0003\n(\n4\u03c0\n3\n)2 1\n\u03c4Nd\n(NNd +NYb)r60 (5)\nwhere r0 is a critical interaction distance for Nd3+-Yb3+\nenergy transfer. This parameter is calculated from the spectral\noverlap of the Nd3+ emission and Yb3+ absorption cross\nsections [20]. In a similar manner, an expression for R60 can be\nderived. Other cross-relaxation coefficients in (2)\u2013(4) include\nthe homogeneous and intra-cluster rates R40 and R\u00af40, respec-\ntively. These rates cannot be derived from the Forster\u2013Dexter\nmodel, due to the poor information on the 4I9\/2-4I15\/2\nabsorption cross section. We thus assume that the critical in-\nteraction distance r0 for cross relaxation among homogeneous\nNd3+ ions is of the same order of magnitude as the correspond-\ning parameter for the Nd3+-Yb3+ cross relaxation.\nThe terms W04 and W40 stand for the Nd3+ pump absorption\nand stimulated emission rates, respectively, while the terms\nW56 and W65 are the Yb3+ absorption and stimulated emission\nrates, respectively. These terms depend on the pump power\nP\u00b1p (z, t), and on the ASE power densities P\u00b1(z, t, \u03bb), and are\ngiven by\nWij(z, t)\n=\n\u0393p\nhcAcore\n\u2211\n\u03c3ij(\u03bbp)\n[\nP+p (z, t) + P\n\u2212\np (z, t)\n]\n\u03bbp\n+\n1\nhcAcore\n\u222b\n\u0393(\u03bb)\u03c3ij(\u03bb)\n[\nP+(z, t, \u03bb) + P\u2212(z, t, \u03bb)\n]\n\u03bbd\u03bb.\n(6)\nIn (6), \u03c3ij is the wavelength-dependent cross section for radia-\ntive transition between levels i and j, h is the Planck constant,\nand c is the speed of light in a vacuum. The summation in\n(6) is over the multiplexed pump powers, while the limits of\nthe integral are defined by the cross section of the 4F3\/2-4I9\/2\ntransitions of Nd3+ ions, and the cross section of the 2F5\/2-\n2F7\/2 transitions of Yb3+ ions. The stimulated transition rate\nW41 accounts for the ASE power emitted by the Nd3+ ions and\nis given by\nW41(z, t)\n=\n1\nhcAcore\n\u222b\n\u0393(\u03bb)\u03c341(\u03bb)\n[\nP+(z, t, \u03bb) + P\u2212(z, t, \u03bb)\n]\n\u03bb d\u03bb\n(7)\nwhere the limits of the integral in (7) are determined by the\ncross section of the 4F3\/2-4I11\/2 transitions of the Nd3+ ions.\nIn these calculations, we assume that the ASE bandwidth is in\nthe wavelength range from 840 to 1160 nm. We note that the\nNd3+ transitions 4F3\/2-4I13\/2 at\u223c 1300 nm can also contribute\nto the ASE power, but we found that this contribution is small\nfor the range of parameters assumed in this work, and therefore,\nit was neglected. The rate of change of the ASE spectral power\ndensities and the pump power along the fiber length are given\nbelow by (8) and (9).

The\nterm P0(\u03bb) in (8) denotes the contribution of the sponta-\nneous emission to the power density of a single mode, and is\ngiven by P0(\u03bb) = hc2\/\u03bb3 [22]. Here, we assume that spon-\ntaneous emission events are equally likely for all propagating\nmodes [23]. Thus, the fraction of spontaneous emission power\nthat is coupled into all guiding modes is given by \u0393se(\u03bb) \u2261\u2211\n\u03b7 g\u03b7\u0393\u03b7(\u03bb)I\u03b7 [15], [23]. The scattering loss \u03b1(\u03bb) at wave-\nlength \u03bb also includes losses that are due to fiber coiling [24].\nFor simplicity, we assume that the scattering losses are constant.\nNonlinear effects are not included in (8) and (9), shown at the\nbottom of the page, as recent experiments have shown that they\nare relatively weak for the range of pumping powers and fiber\ngeometries that are assumed in this work [7].

The integration\nof the rate-propagation equations is carried iteratively along\nthe forward and backward propagation direction, until all\nthe ASE power densities converge to a steady-state value\n[10]. On each integration step, the populations of homoge-\nneous and clustered ions are found analytically by reduc-\ning (2) and (3) to a cubic equation and by reducing (4) to\na quadratic equation for the unknowns N4(z) and N\u00af4(z),\nrespectively.\nIII. APPROXIMATE SOLUTION\nWe extend the approximate quasi-analytical solutions for\nsingle-doped Nd3+- or Yb3+-doped fiber lasers [10] to the\nNd3+-Yb3+ codoped system. We assume that Nd3+ ion\u2013ion\ninteractions can be neglected, so that all the Nd3+ ions are cou-\npled to Yb3+ ions (k \u0003 0), and the cross-relaxation rates satisfy\nR40 = R\u00af40 \u0003 0. Because of the smaller overlap of the Yb3+\nemission band with the Nd3+ absorption band, the calculated\nbackward energy transfer from Yb3+ to Nd3+ is considerably\nweaker than the forward energy transfer, and can safely be\nneglected. Therefore, we assume R60 \u0003 0. Furthermore, we\nassume strong pumping conditions, such that the oscillating\nlaser power P\u00b1s (z) is strong enough to allow neglecting the\neffect of the ASE on the gain. In this case, the gain of Nd3+ and\nYb3+ ions is strongly saturated, and we have N4(z)\u0007 NNd\nand N6(z)\u0007 NYb. Under these assumptions, the integration\nof (2), (3), (8), and (9) is considerably simplified, as described\nin the Appendix. In particular, we obtain a closed-form solution\nfor the laser power, namely\nP\u00b1s (z) =\n1\n2\n[\u221a\n\u03a8(z)2 +B2 \u00b1\u03a8(z)\n]\n(10)\nwhere \u03a8(z) and the parameter B are defined in (A9) and\n(A10) in the Appendix, respectively. The function \u03a8(z) is\nderived from the numerical integration of (A12) (e.g., using the\nRunge\u2013Kutta method) and is found by subsequently iterating\nthe boundary condition (A13) (e.g., using bisection method),\nuntil convergence is achieved. This procedure is significantly\nfaster and simpler to employ than the numerical solution of the\nexact (2), (3), (8), and (9).\nIV. EXAMPLES\nIn what follows, we present a set of examples of high-\npower NYDFLs, where we demonstrate the laser design opti-\nmization. The laser parameters that we consider are the pump\npower, pump configuration, fiber length, scattering loss, pump\nwavelengths, output mirror reflectivity, laser wavelength, and\nthe Nd3+ and Yb3+ concentrations. We also compare the\naccuracy of the quasi-analytical solutions of the model to the\nexact numerical solution of the rate-propagation equations. It is\nassumed that the pump power is wavelength multiplexed, e.g.,\nat \u03bbp = 808 nm, \u03bbp = 940 nm, and \u03bbp = 976 nm, so it pumps\nTABLE I\nPARAMETERS USED IN THE NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS\nboth the Nd3+ and the Yb3+ ions. Furthermore, we assume that\nthe Bragg reflectors are centered at 1100 nm where both Nd3+\nand Yb3+ ions have efficient optical transitions, and therefore\nthe laser oscillates at this wavelength. The out-coupling mirror\nwith the lower reflectivity is at z = L. Unless otherwise stated,\nthe parameters used for the numerical calculations correspond\nclosely to these of the experimental NYDFL described in [7],\nand are summarized in Table I.\nIn Fig. 2, we show the laser output power P+out = P+s (L)[1\u2212\nR2(\u03bbs)], emitted from the output mirror at z = L, as a function\nof the total injected pump power Pp(0). The lasing threshold is\nnear Pp = 890 mW (see inset), and we note the linear increase\nof the output power without any sign of output power saturation\nat high pump power. This behavior is in contrast to other\ncodoped laser systems, e.g., Er3+-Yb3+ fibers [11], where the\nso-called energy-transfer \u201cbottleneck\u201d limits the efficiency of\nthe system. The slope efficiency (\u03b7D \u2261 \u2206P+out\/\u2206Pp) of the\nlaser is about 0.71, which is in good agreement with the 0.72\nefficiency reported in recent experiments [7]. Similar results are\nobtained with respect to the absorbed pump power, which indi-\ncate a very efficient pump-power absorption in the fiber. The\ncalculated threshold of the quasi-analytical solution is about\n920 mW, which is in good agreement with the exact numerical\nvalue. We note that the approximate quasi-analytical solution\nbecomes less accurate as the pump power is increased, and\nthat the slope obtained from the approximate solution is lower\nthan that of the exact solution. This deviation is a result of the\ncontribution of the \u03bbp = 976 nm wavelength to P+p (z), which\nis not exactly exponential, as predicted by (A11).

The pump\npower is divided among three different pump wavelengths at \u03bbp = 976 nm,\n\u03bbp = 940 nm, and \u03bbp = 808 nm, with power of Pp(0)\/2, Pp(0)\/4, and\nPp(0)\/4, respectively. The solid lines represent the exact solution of (2), (3),\n(8), and (9), whereas the circles represent the approximate quasi-analytical\nsolution obtained from (10) and (A12). The rectangulars represent experimental\nresults obtained from [7]. The inset shows the output power near the lasing\nthreshold.\nunder strong pumping conditions, the population N6(z) builds\nup significantly near the injected pump end at z = 0, and the\ncondition N6(z)\u0007 NYb leading to the approximate (A11) is\nnot satisfied.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the laser slope efficiency (\u03b7D) and the\nlaser threshold power as a function of the laser length (L). We\nnote that there is a good agreement between the quasi-analytical\nsolution and the exact solution over the entire range of fiber\nlengths and scattering loss (\u03b1). The dependence of the slope\nefficiency on the fiber length is in qualitative agreement with\nresults obtained for the conversion efficiency (\u03b7c \u2261 P+out\/Pp)\nof typical strongly pumped fiber lasers [10]. That is, the slope\nefficiency increases with the fiber length until it saturates.\nThis increase strongly depends on the scattering loss, and is\nachieved in shorter fiber lengths for higher scattering loss, but\nwith lower efficiency. The slope efficiency also depends on\nthe pumping configuration and higher slope efficiencies can be\nobtained by pumping at z = L. For example, for scattering loss\n\u03b1s = 5\u00d7 10\u22123 m\u22121 the fiber lengths where the slope efficiency\nis maximized are approximately 24 m for pumping at z = 0\nand 33 m for pumping at z = L. If the scattering loss is larger,\ni.e., \u03b1s = 5\u00d7 10\u22122 m\u22121, the corresponding figures are 9 m for\npumping at z = 0 and 13 m for pumping at z = L. On the\nother hand, the laser threshold shows only weak dependence on\nthe pumping configuration, as expected, and it is more strongly\naffected by the scattering losses.\nNext, we consider a few examples of a laser design opti-\nmization, in which we select the optimal laser length for max-\nimizing the laser output power and hence the laser conversion\nefficiency. Fig. 4 shows the effect of multiplexing two pump\nsources with different wavelengths on the laser efficiency. The\nfigure depicts contour lines of (a) the optimal laser length\nand (b) the corresponding output power, as a function of a\npump wavelength in the Nd3+ absorption band (in the range\n700\u2013850 nm) and a pump wavelength in the Yb3+ absorption\nband (in the range 850\u20131050 nm). We note the existence of\nFig. 3.

The solid and dashed lines represent the exact solution\nof (2), (3), (8), and (9), for pumping at z = 0 or at z = L, respectively.

The\nhighest efficiency is achieved at pump wavelengths where both\nthe Nd3+ and Yb3+ pump absorptions are maximized, e.g., on\npumping the Yb3+ at \u03bbp = 976 nm and Nd3+ at \u03bbp = 808 nm.\nWe note that the efficiency decreases on changing the Yb3+\npump wavelength from \u03bbp = 976 nm to \u03bbp = 940 nm by less\nthan 10%. Thus, the Yb3+ pump wavelength selection is more\nlimited by the optimal laser length, which should be kept short\nenough to reduce the effect of fiber nonlinearities.\nIn Fig. 5, we show a contour plot of (a) the optimal laser\nlength and (b) the corresponding output power, as a function\nof the laser wavelength and the output mirror reflectivity at\nz = L. It is found that for sufficiently high output mirror\nreflectivities (R2 > 5\u00d7 10\u22123), the optimal laser length is not\nsensitive to the choice of the laser wavelength \u03bbs, as long as\n\u03bbs \u0001 1045 nm.

This spectral\nwidth of constant optimal length becomes broader as the output\nmirror reflectivity becomes higher. We conclude that an opti-\nmum use of the same laser cavity can be realized for a range\nof laser wavelengths, which can be important for tunable laser\napplications. There exists an optimum laser wavelength for\nobtaining the highest efficiency, i.e., \u03bbs \u0003 1050 nm; however,\nit is at an extremely small optimum output mirror reflectivity\n(R2 \u0003 10\u22125). For shorter wavelengths (\u03bbs < 1050 nm), the\noutput power is limited by a strongly competing ASE due to\nthe transitions at \u03bb \u0003 1060 nm, and the output mirror reflec-\ntivity should be increased in order to suppress this ASE and\nreach threshold. For longer wavelengths (\u03bbs > 1050 nm), the\ndecrease in the laser output power is due to the smaller Nd3+\nand Yb3+ emission cross sections, and the long wavelength\nlimit of the laser tuning is eventually fixed by the laser cutoff\nconditions. In relation to these results, we note that the laser\noutput power can be tuned across a somewhat larger spectral\nbandwidth compared with pure Nd3+- or Yb3+-doped fiber\nlasers [13]. Furthermore, some control over the gain spectrum\ncan be achieved via selection of the relative dopant concentra-\ntions, which might offer more tuning flexibility compared with\nFig. 5.

It is also worth to mention that the laser output\npower tuning depends on the choice of the glass host, which\nmodifies the cross sections of both Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions.\nOther important design parameters that we consider are the\nNd3+ and Yb3+ concentrations. In Fig. 6, we plot the contour\nlines of the optimal laser length and the corresponding output\npower versus the Yb3+ concentration and the Nd3+-Yb3+\nratio. The optimal laser length is found to be strongly depen-\ndent on the Yb3+ concentration and much less on the Nd3+\nconcentration, in particular in the limit of high Nd3+-Yb3+\nratios. We note that the optimal length generally decreases\nwith increasing Yb3+ concentration. The highest efficiency\nthat can be obtained from the laser on variation of the Yb3+\nand Nd3+ concentrations is approximately 0.77. Further in-\ncrease is ultimately limited by concentration quenching effects,\ne.g., the formation of Yb3+ ion clusters that inhibit the Nd3+-\nYb3+ energy transfer and can self-absorb the emitted light. On\nincreasing the Nd3+-Yb3+ ratio, the efficiency first increases\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on December 16, 2009 at 06:16 from IEEE Xplore.

This saturation effect is a consequence\nof the cross-relaxation losses of Nd3+ ions, which are more\nsignificant in higher Nd3+ concentrations where the average\ndistance between two Nd3+ ions is smaller.\nThe importance of Nd3+ ion\u2013ion interactions for the laser\nefficiency is further illustrated in Fig. 7. Here, we present the\noutput power of an optimal length NYDFL versus the Nd3+\nconcentration, with the fraction of clustered Nd3+ ions (k) as a\nparameter. The corresponding dependence of the optimal laser\nlength is similar to that of Fig. 6, i.e., it decreases with the\nNd3+ concentration, more strongly in the limit of small Nd3+\nconcentrations. The highest efficiency that can be obtained by\nthe variation of the Nd3+ concentration depends on the amount\nof Nd3+ clusters in the system. In particular, as the fraction\nof Nd3+ ions in the clusters is increased, the efficiency of\nthe NYDFL decreases, and the optimal Nd3+ concentration\nbecomes smaller. We note the difference between the effect of\nNd3+ clusters in this system, to the effect of Er3+ clusters in\nEr3+-doped systems. While in the four-level system of Nd3+,\nthe clusters lower the population density of the 4F3\/2 manifold\ndue to an increase in the cross-relaxation rate, as well as reduce\nthe number of Nd3+ ions that interact with Yb3+, the three-\nFig. 7.

Therefore, the decrease of the\nNYDFL efficiency due to an increase in the number of clustered\nions is less significant than in three-level systems (e.g., see\n[17]). For example, the maximum efficiency of a system with\nfull clustering (k = 1) is 0.56, for a Nd3+ concentration of\nNNd \u0003 1\u00d7 1025 m\u22123, whereas the corresponding figures for\na system with no clustering (k = 0) are 0.73 and NNd \u0003 8.5\u00d7\n1026 m\u22123, respectively.\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe presented a theoretical analysis of high-power NYDFLs,\nbased on a detailed rate-propagation equation model that takes\ninto account the energy transfer between Nd3+ and Yb3+,\ncross relaxation in the Nd3+ ion system, and the propagation\nof higher order modes. We considered examples of cladding-\npumped NYDFLs operating at spectral bandwidth in the vicin-\nity of 1100 nm, where both the Nd3+ and Yb3+ have efficient\noptical transitions. Our results demonstrate the high slope effi-\nciency of NYDFLs, about 0.71, in agreement with recent exper-\nimental results [7]. It has been shown, that pumping at z = L\nleads to higher slope efficiencies, particularly in the limit of\nlonger fibers. On the other hand, the pumping configuration has\nbeen shown to have only a small effect on the laser threshold.\nThe optimal fiber length for achieving the maximum output\npower can be found by tuning the Nd3+ and Yb3+ pump\nwavelengths and is not sensitive to the pump wavelength se-\nlection within a large bandwidth of the Yb3+ absorption band.\nPumping at z = 0 with pump wavelengths of \u03bbp = 940 nm and\n\u03bbp = 808 nm, the optimal fiber length is \u223c 24 m, the slope\nefficiency is \u223c 0.66, and the laser threshold is \u223c 0.91 W. In\npractice, however, the choice of the fiber length and hence the\nachievable output power are limited due to fiber nonlinearities.\nOn increasing the Yb3+ concentration, the laser becomes more\nefficient, whereas the optimal Nd3+ concentration is limited\nby concentration quenching. In particular, Nd3+ clustering\neffects can reduce the maximum output power of the NYDFL.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

We have shown that the laser wavelength can be\ntuned in wide range, e.g., from about 1050 to 1120 nm (and\nbeyond), with only small variation in the optimal laser length,\nprovided the mirror reflectivity is high enough.\nAn approximate quasi-analytical solution to the model equa-\ntions was derived and compared with the exact numerical\ncalculations. It was shown that the approximate solutions are\nin good agreement with the exact solutions for a range of\nfiber lengths and pumping configurations. The approximate\nsolutions become less accurate when pumping at \u03bbp = 976 nm,\nparticularly in the limit of high pump power.\nAPPENDIX\nQUASI-ANALYTICAL SOLUTION OF\n(2), (3), (8), AND (9)\nThe mathematical description of the optical power spectrum\npropagating in the laser cavity can be significantly simplified\nby assuming that the oscillating laser power is strong enough to\nneglect the influence of the ASE on the population inversion\nof Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions. That is, we assume P\u00b1(z, \u03bb) =\nP\u00b1s (z)\u03b4(\u03bb\u2212 \u03bbs). We also ignore the effect of cross relaxation\namong Nd3+ ions, i.e., we assume k \u0003 0 and R40 = R\u00af40 \u0003 0.\nIn this case, (8) reduces to\n\u00b1 1\nP\u00b1s (z)\ndP\u00b1s (z)\ndz\n= gs(z)\u2212 \u03b1(\u03bbs) (A1)\nwhere gs(z) is the differential signal gain per unit length\nat \u03bb = \u03bbs. We consider only lasing transitions in the Nd3+\nions around the 1060-nm emission band. Therefore, gs(z) \u2261\n\u0393s(\u03c341(\u03bbs)N4(z)+[\u03c365(\u03bbs)+\u03c356(\u03bbs)]N6(z)\u2212\u03c356(\u03bbs)NYb),\nwhere \u0393s \u2261 \u0393(\u03bbs). We further limit ourselves to high laser\npower circulating the cavity, such that the constituent ion gain\nis saturated, i.e., we assume N4(z)\u0007 NNd and N6(z)\u0007 NYb.\nEmploying these assumptions to (2) and (3), one obtains for\nthe differential signal gain\ngs(z) \u0003 g\nNd\n0 (z)\nfNd(z) +\nP+s (z)+P\n\u2212\ns (z)\nPNdsat\n+\ngYb0 (z)\nfYb(z) +\nP+s (z)+P\n\u2212\ns (z)\nPYbsat (A2)\nwhere fNd(z), gNd0 (z), and PNdsat are parameters related to the\ngain due to the Nd3+ ions and are defined by\nfNd(z) \u2261 1 + \u03c4NdR45 [NYb \u2212N6(z)]\n+\n\u0393p\u03c4Nd\nhcAcore\n\u2211\n\u03c340(\u03bbp)\u03bbp\n[\nP+p (z) + P\n\u2212\np (z)\n] (A3)\ngNd0 (z) \u2261\nNNd\u0393p\n\u03bbsPNdsat\n\u2211\n\u03c304(\u03bbp)\u03bbp\n[\nP+p (z) + P\n\u2212\np (z)\n] (A4)\nPNdsat \u2261\nhcAcore\n\u0393s\u03c341(\u03bbs)\u03bbs\u03c4Nd\n(A5)\nwhere the summation is over the multiplexed pump powers.
