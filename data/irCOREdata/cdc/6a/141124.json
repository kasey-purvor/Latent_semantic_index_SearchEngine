To speed their journey, they\nhave aligned sustainability with core strategy. Top leadership is driving the\nstrategy which is overseen by the board. M&S have made a very public\ncommitment: Plan A with measurable targets, timescales and\naccountabilities. The strategy is being integrated into very business function\nand strategic business unit; and involves suppliers, employees and\nincreasingly customers. To enable implementation, the company is\ndeveloping its knowledge-management and training; engaging with wider\nstakeholders including investors; building partnerships and collaborations;\nand has evolved its specialist sustainability team into an internal change-\nmanagement consultancy and coach\/ catalyst for continuous improvement.\nKEY WORDS: Marks & Spencer; Plan A; corporate sustainability; embedding\nsustainability; engaging stakeholders; sustainability through value-chain;\nshared value.\nBritish retailing is amongst the most competitive of business sectors anywhere in the\nworld. It is all the more instructive that a number of the leading British retailers are\ncompeting fiercely on responsibility and sustainability. Amongst these, the iconic\nMarks and Spencer (founded in 1884), has set itself the ambitious goal to become\nthe world\u2019s most sustainable major retailer by 2015. This represents a significant\nelaboration and extension of its \u201cPlan A\u201d commitment to sustainability (\u201cPlan A\nbecause there is no Plan B for the one planet we\u2019ve got!\u201d) first launched in Jan 2007.\n(ILLUSTRATION) It is the latest stage in a continuing journey to embed corporate\nresponsibility and sustainability \u2013 see illustration. Krishnan Hundal \u2013 head of general\nmerchandising sourcing and technology, and one of the key M&S executive directors\nin implementing Plan A \u2013 describes the company\u2019s evolution from yesterday\u2019s\ncorporate social responsibility to today\u2019s \u201cHow we do business\u201d (HWDB) to\ntomorrow\u2019s \u201cthe business we do.\u201di\nBACKGROUND\nThe company was founded with strong values of fair trading: treating staff well,\nbuilding long-term shared destiny relationships with suppliers, and offering good\nquality and a liberal approach to customers wishing to return \/ exchange goods\npurchased. This paternalistic approach included generous contributions to charities\n2and community causes, developed further around the company\u2019s centenary. It\nsurvived until the 1990s when globalisation and increased competition led to the\nabandonment of many traditional suppliers and loss of market shareii. The company\nreached its nadir with a hostile take-over bid led by the billionaire retailer Sir Philip\nGreen in 2004. M&S changed its leadership, fought off the hostile bid (thanks in part\nto the residual loyalty of an army of small-scale, private investors, customers and\ncommentators), and as part of its recovery plan, overhauled the long-standing\ncommitment to corporate philanthropy and community involvement, in favour of\nembedding higher standards of environmental and social performance across the\nbusiness.\nLEADERSHIP: TONE FROM TOP\nThe original Plan A - launched publicly in Jan 2007 \u2013 contained 100 specific targets to\nbe met by 2012 to help embed responsibility and sustainability through the business.\nIt was built around five \u201cpillars\u201d - climate, waste, sustainable materials, fair\npartnership & health. Plan A was the brainchild of Sir Stuart Roseiii \u2013 the former\nM&S manager brought back by the board to be CEO in early summer 2004, to fight\noff the hostile bid from Philip Green. In his six and a half years + as CEO, then\nexecutive chairman and most recently as non-executive chairman, Rose has led from\nthe front on Plan A and sustainability.iv Rose was careful to hand the Plan A baton\nover to his successor as CEO: Marc Bolland at one of the regular Plan A stakeholder\nconsultations, held in June 2010. In turn, Bolland from the outset stressed his\npersonal commitment to continuing with Plan A. In his first day as CEO, he spoke to a\nmass meeting of head office staff in the company\u2019s Paddington Basin corporate HQ\nto explain his leadership strategy; and then took unscripted questions. To most\nquestions he promised to look and learn and to answer in six months \u2013 but to\nquestions about Plan A, he replied without hesitation that there would be no let-up\nin implementation. Indeed, Bolland is now pushing for greater consumer-focus for\nPlan A and looking to concentrate on those individual targets proving harder to\nachieve.\nWhilst Rose was very strongly associated with Plan A, the M&S commitment very\nvisibly and concretely had the commitment of top leadership. In addition to the\nappointment of a senior executive: Richard Gilles as Plan A director (previously in\ncharge of new store development), a team of top executives had direct\nresponsibilities for the implementation of the Plan A targets in their areas of the\nbusiness. Thus the head of food technology, Paul Willgoss, handled innovations eg in\nfood packaging and product formulations; whilst Krishan Hundal led on piloting of\ngreen factories with clothes suppliers and living wage pilot initiatives in Bangladesh\nwith other suppliers. A percentage of senior executives\u2019 bonuses related to delivery\nof their Plan A-related Key Performance Indicators.\nGOVERNANCE AND OVERSIGHT\nGovernance and oversight of Plan A is led by \u201cThe how we do business committee\u201d\noriginally chaired by Rose and now by Bolland and involving senior executives from\nacross the company responsible for implementing Plan A. This group meets monthly\nand has now met on more than 50 occasions. Bolland has now added a 2-monthly\n3meeting, with the M&S executive board to ensure Plan A is aligned with Group\nstrategy and investment decisions. Regular reports are provided to the main M&S\nplc board, which includes the non-Executive Directors. It is an indication of the\nsuccess and profile of Plan A that the main board reviews Plan A every six months as\npart of the Risk committee and review of the Risk Register \u2013 threats to Plan A are\nseen as threats to corporate reputation and commercial success.\nPUBLIC COMMITMENT\nPlan A with its very measurable and specific targets became a very public and high\nprofile BHAG \u2013 Big hairy audacious goalv - launched in Jan 2007 \u2013 initially to staff and\ninstitutional investors, and then to customers and Civil Society stakeholders. Two\nand a half years in to the original five year Plan A programme, Rose and his senior\ncolleagues concluded that they needed to ramp up the commitment. They reasoned\nthat there was mounting global evidence of environmental and social harm (what\nthe Chief Scientific Adviser to the British Government Prof Sir John Beddington has\ncalled a \u201cPerfect Storm\u201d); M&S had learnt that it could make a positive difference to\nthese issues; M&S had found positive commercial results from their commitment\nwith significant savings; consumers were increasingly concerned about sustainability\nand looking for leadership by the brands they trusted; and competitors were\nimproving their own performancevi. For all these reasons, M&S in early 2010\nannounced an extension of Plan A with additional targets and the overall objective of\nbecoming the world\u2019s most sustainable major retailer by 2015. Work is due to start\nin March 2011 to develop more detailed criteria for the most sustainable retailer\ngoal. It is envisaged this will be tested with stakeholders from autumn 2011\nonwards.\nINTEGRATING INTO OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNITS\nWhereas before Plan A, the M&S environmental and social commitments tended to\nbe bolt-ons to business operations \u2013 run by a specialist CSR function \u2013 the Plan A\ncommitments are built in to business purpose and strategy, and require each part of\nthe business to change the ways they do business. Marks & Spencer are clear that\nPlan A is a change management brand. In human resources, for example, there is\nadditional work around health and well-being for employees with a well-being\nwebsite and healthy eating workshops. Those responsible for new store\ndevelopment have targets around creating more ecological stores. The company has\na central innovation fund to facilitate Plan A implementation. There are currently\nmore than forty projects being funded, e.g. for new logistics, refrigeration and\npackaging. The great majority of these projects have been proposed by business\nunits responding to Plan A targets. A few have been suggested by the corporate\ncentre to tackle log-jams in Plan A implementation. Increasingly, M&S marketing is\nemphasising its sustainability credentials (on pack, in-store, and in print and TV\nadvertising). By 2020, the goal is that every single product sold by M&S will have a\nPlan A story \u2013 and preferably two or three stories. Purchasing staff have had a\nparticularly heavy work-load as more than half the original 100 Plan A targets\ninvolved changes in suppliers\u2019 practices.\nENGAGING THE VALUE-CHAIN\n4Indeed, engaging the value-chain has been a key feature of Plan A. Before publicly\nlaunching Plan A, Rose met privately with the CEOs of M&S\u2019s largest suppliers \u2013\ntypically billion pound+ businesses in their own right. Rose took his key suppliers\nthrough Plan A and the rationale for it \u2013 and was pleasantly surprised to find a\nreceptive audience. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t you requiring this, some of our other big business\ncustomers would be \u2013 and we would prefer to learn how to do this with you,\u201d was a\ntypical response. M&S set up an on-line Knowledge Exchange for its 2,500 suppliers\nto learn from each other, as well as with M&S, in implementing higher sustainability\nstandards. In the first summer, that the exchange ran, 1500 suppliers participated.\nThe Knowledge Exchange continues particularly through working groups on\nparticular issues such as refrigeration. In February 2011, 1000 suppliers attended a\none day conference in London which the company believes to be one of the biggest\nsustainability conferences to be held in the UK in 2011. The conference had, more\nthan 25 practical \u2018how to\u2019 break-out sessions, and keynote speeches from Marc\nBolland, new M&S Chairman Robert Swanell, John Brook, Chairman and CEO of\nCoca-Cola Enterprises and leading environmental campaigners such as Jonathon\nPorritt. M&S has continued to help finance and run pilots with key suppliers so that\nall can learn about how to innovate for Plan A in the most cost-effective ways \u2013 and\nthe company has also provided information about possible sources of capital finance\nfor suppliers eg from the World Bank \/ IFC \u2013 especially those in developing\neconomies \u2013 when capital investment is required to meet the higher environmental\nand social standards. Other suppliers are now being taken to learn from these\nmodel factories.\nMore recently, M&S have sought to more actively engage customers as well. One of\ntwo additional \u201cpillars\u201d to Plan A (building on the original five) announced as part of\nthe Plan A extension in 2010, is to engage consumers. The company did considerable\nmarket research to understand consumer views on sustainability. They segmented\ncustomers into those disinterested; those who might take episodic action; \u201clight\ngreens\u201d who would act if companies like M&S made it easy for them to do so; and\n\u201cdeep greens\u201d \u2013 committed to changing their behaviour and supporting efforts to\nhelp them to do so. SEE ILLUSTRATION.\nM&S has been an early practitioner of what WWF has described as the process of (1)\ninnovation; (2) choice-influencing; and (3) choice editing. M&S moved early to\nchoice-edit by selling only free-range eggs and using only free-range eggs in their\nprepared food; and by selling only fair-trade tea and coffee. Their decision to charge\n5p for plastic disposable carrier bags (with all profits from the sales going to support\nthe work of the environmental charity Groundwork in creating 100 \u2018greenspaces\u2019 in\ncommunities across sthe UK) was a high-profile (and some thought initially, high-risk)\nchoice-influencing \u2013 which has led to a substantial 80% reduction in plastic bags used\nin its food halls \u2013 and raised much needed funds for Groundwork.\nEVERYBODY\u2019S BUSINESS\nThe other additional \u201cpillar\u201d to Plan A (building on the original five) announced as\npart of the Plan A extension in 2010, is to engage employees. Long before Plan A,\nM&S had been a pioneer in employee volunteering into the community (linking this,\n5particularly for young and junior managers, to personal and professional\ndevelopment eg through 100 hour Development Assignments). M&S had also\nseconded managers to government and Civil Society organisations as part of\ncorporate citizenship and management development. With the launch of Plan A,\nhowever, there was a concerted drive to engage all 75,000 employees in improving\nthe firm\u2019s environmental and social performance. Each of the 650 M&S store has a\nvolunteer \u201cPlan A champion\u201d who takes on responsibility for involving co-workers in\nin-store implementation of Plan A, on top of their day jobs. SEE BOX AND\nILLUSTRATION. Most stores now also have volunteer Green Teams. There is also\nnow a regional network of Plan A champions who meet once a quarter to swap\nexperiences and share good practice. Plan A champions don\u2019t have the\naccountability for delivering Plan A in their stores \u2013 that remains with individual\nstore managers \u2013 but to enthuse their co-workers to be proactive on Plan A\nimplementation and spot opportunities to change established practice. Four years\ninto Plan A, M&S have found that the champions need to be self-confident, good\ncommunicators and good motivators; and that the corporate centre can give\npractical support by keeping them informed on how their store is doing on Plan A\nand by providing regular \u201ctalking points\u201d to use with co-workers. Staff were given\nopportunities to test out some of the Plan A innovations before these were launched\nto the public. Thus, for example, M&S\u2019s new loft insulation service was first offered\nto employees \u2013 with 10,000 taking up the offer of free installation before it was\navailable to the public. Indeed M&S Energy Saving Service which now has nearly\n500,000 accounts came about as a result of a business opportunity spotted by a line\nmanager in the homeware division.\nBOX: Championing Plan A\n21 year-old Rachel Barton is one of the volunteer, in-store champions for Plan A \u2013 in\nthe Eastbourne store where she works, on the English south coast.\nRachel joined M&S part-time whilst still at school, working Saturdays and continued\nto work for the company whilst she took a geography degree at Southampton\nUniversity. Whilst at university, her interest in sustainability was stimulated, so when\nshe returned to the Eastbourne store full-time after graduating, she took little\npersuading when colleagues encouraged her to apply to be a Plan A champion. This\ninvolves reporting to co-workers on progress both in the Eastbourne store and\ngenerally, and enthusing and coaxing colleagues to get more involved in different\naspects of Plan A implementation.\nSince August 2010, Marks and Spencer has been measuring each month the\nperformance of all their stores against seven Plan A metrics seen as the most\nrelevant for stores, such as electricity consumption, waste recovery and paper usage.\nStores get their ranking on each of these seven metrics as well as a total Plan A\nranking. The monthly rankings data is proving a useful tool for the in-store Plan A\nchampions like Rachel, to generate interest and harness competitive instincts.\nEastbourne, for example, ranked 180th overall last August but now has climbed to\n19th place. Challenged on why the store has a relatively low ranking on electricity,\nRachel doesn\u2019t miss a heartbeat, before explaining that the store is being refurbished\nso the electricity is running through the night whilst the workmen refit when the\n6store is closed. Rachel uses existing store staff communications like Eastbourne\u2019s\n\u201chave I got news for you\u201d flyers to spread Plan A ideas and results which she gets\nherself from the company intranet and her regional Plan A champion.\nMore than four years into Plan A, the network of in-store champions is also proving\nan early additional outlet for younger employees to demonstrate what they can\nachieve. A significant number of the champions are now moving into the Marks &\nSpencer management development programme, because the key attributes of Plan\nA champions are proving to be good people skills, a capacity to engage and enthuse,\nto inspire and lead change (M&S are clear that Plan A is a long-term change-\nmanagement programme) and obviously a keen interest in embedding sustainability.\nENABLING PLAN A\nIn driving Plan A, M&S has worked with a wide range of existing and new partners\n(some commercial, some academic, some public sector and some not-for-profits) to\ninnovate and build up its knowledge-base of how to embed sustainability. Plan A has\naccelerated the move towards new and innovative partnerships such as the Better\nCotton Initiative; and often now involves collaborations with otherwise fierce retail\ncompetitors. Detailed annual Plan A progress reports, identifying targets achieved,\nwell under way or still to tackled have described both successes \u2013 and areas of\ndifficulty. Initially, six-monthly meetings led by Rose and his top team reported back\nto key external sustainability stakeholders \u2013ranging from Greenpeace and WWF to\nPETA and Compassion in World Farming. At these 2 hour events, stakeholders are\nfree to ask any questions they wish about Plan A performance \u2013 and this frequently\nleads to further consultations. These events are now annual but have been extended\nalso to key suppliers and most recently to institutional investors as well.\nM&S has managed to develop some of its traditional company-charity relationships\ninto mutually beneficial partnerships. Its seventeen year relationship with the\ndevelopment charity Oxfam, for example, has been transformed with Oxfam charity\nshops handing out \u00a35-off vouchers redeemable in M&S stores when members of the\npublic donate their old M&S clothing to the Oxfam shops. Besides increasing\nbusiness for Oxfam charity shops and generating new revenues for M&S as vouchers\nare redeemed the programme emphasises the resilience of M&S clothing and\nenhances relationships with M&S customers. The Oxfam-distributed vouchers have a\nmuch higher redemption rate than other M&S vouchers and has proved very\nsuccessful for M&S. Significantly, the idea for the money-off vouchers with Oxfam\ncame from an M&S employee rather than the Plan A team.. Plan A is now integrated\nwithin the company\u2019s main leadership Development course. Participants are given\npersonal projects to complete which are real and current Plan A \u201cproblems\u201d which\nneed fresh thinking to solve.\nAs a founding member company of the UK\u2019s premier business-led CR coalition:\nBusiness in the Community and twice the BITC \u201cBusiness of the Year\u201d (first \u2013\ncontroversially \u2013 in 2004 at the height of the hostile take-over bid; and then again in\n2006), M&S has used networks like BITC (where Rose was chairman from 2007-2010)\nboth to learn and to share its learning with other businesses.\n7There is an annual Plan A progress report with external assurance provided by Ernst\n& Young. This provides data on each Plan A target, whether it has been achieved\nand if not, what still needs to be done. Having external auditors crawl over the Plan\nA report with the same seriousness they devote to the company\u2019s annual report is\nseen as a valuable, additional discipline to keep moving forwards. Aditionally, key\nstaff receive a 2- A3 page \u201ctraffic lights\u201d status report on Plan A every month.\nM&S retains a specialist sustainability function \u2013 but unlike in those companies\nwhere sustainability remains a \u201cbolt-on,\u201d the M&S specialist team are not expected\nto implement Plan A themselves. Instead, they serve as an internal change-\nmanagement consultancy, a repository of how-to knowledge and relationship\nmanagers, with the crucial tasks of collating the measurement and reporting of Plan\nA performance, facilitating continuous improvement and mentoring line\nmanagement. An internal Plan A innovation fund is open to all employees and\nadministered by the sustainability department led by Mike Barry.\nCONCLUSION\nMarks and Spencer\u2019s continuing journey to embed corporate responsibility and\nsustainability remains a work-in-progress. They have demonstrated however, a\nbusiness case for \u201cthe way we do business\u201d based on trust-based relationships with\nemployees, building an inclusive culture, stimulating innovation, and creating long-\nterm shared destiny relationships with suppliers and customers. In 2007, M&S\ncommitted \u00a3200m over the five years of Plan A to aid implementation. After 2.5\nyears, M&S were able to report that rather than costing money, the innovation and\nnew ways of doing things stimulated by Plan A was leading to savings of \u00a350m p.a. \u2013\nwhich is being recycled into further implementation of Plan A.\nThe 2010 Accenture \/ UNGC survey of CEOs identifies six key attributes for\nembedding corporate responsibility and sustainability. These are:\nThese issues should be fully embedded into the strategy and operations of a\ncompany\nBoards should discuss and act on these issues\nThese issues should be fully embedded into the strategy and operations of\nsubsidiaries\nCompanies should embed these issues through their global supply chain\nCompanies should engage in industry collaborations and multi-stakeholder\npartnerships to address development goals\nCompanies should incorporate these issues into discussions with financial\nanalysts.vii\nThe M&S case demonstrates all six of these core behaviours in practice. Marks and\nSpencer also well illustrates the wider practices of companies embedding CR and\nsustainability as identified in this book.\nDavid Grayson\n8March 2011\nProposed photo illustrations\n\uf0b7 Marks and Spencer customer segmentation\n\uf0b7 Eastbourne store Plan A champion Rachel Barton\nDavid Grayson is director of the Doughty Centre for Corporate Responsibility at\nCranfield School of Management.
