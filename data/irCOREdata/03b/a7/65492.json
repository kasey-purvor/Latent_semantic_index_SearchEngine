Public health outcomes \n3. Partnership working \n4. Health policy \n \n3 \n \nBACKGROUND \nResearch about the importance of partnership working in health and the processes this involves is \nprominent in the public health management literature.\n1,2\n However, it is not clear to what extent (if at \nall) partnership working contributes to achieving better population health outcomes.\n2\n In order to \nestablish the extent of the evidence-base that does explore this issue, and to highlight gaps within it, a \nsystematic review was conducted.   \n \nPublic Health Partnerships \nIn recent years, there has been an implicit assumption amongst English policymakers that \npartnerships are a priori \u201ea good thing\u201f which will aid attempts by various local organisations to \nimprove public health.\n3,4\n  From Labour\u201fs first (post-1997) White Paper on public health\n5\n  through to the \nmost recent Status Report on tackling health inequalities,\n6\n the notion that partnership working is \nessential to achieving desirable public health outcomes in the UK is never contested.  This is evident \nin the plethora of public health partnerships established during the last decade, including Health \nAction Zones (HAZs); Healthy Living Centres (HLCs); Neighbourhood Renewal Partnerships; Health \nImprovement Programmes (HImPs); and Local Strategic Partnerships (LSPs).  \n \nYet, partnerships incur significant costs\n7\n and their contribution to improving health outcomes is far \nfrom clear.\n2,8\n In part, this is because the prominent research literature on partnerships often focuses \non process-related issues, rather than outcomes.\n2\n  Additionally, whilst a great deal has been written \nabout partnerships between health and social care organisations,\n9,10,11,12\n far less is known about \npartnerships for public health.  This seems surprising, given that public health problems often involve \nprecisely the kind of complex interplay of factors that single organisations may find difficult to tackle in \nisolation. The Foresight report on the complex policy challenges posed by obesity is a good example \nof the rationale underpinning the presumed need to work in partnership to tackle public health \nconcerns.\n13 \n \nAlthough it is recognised that definitions of successful partnership working are multiple and varied, it \nwas not the aim of the study presented here to explore these differences, nor was it part of our \nobjectives to measure the extent to which partnerships had (or had not been) successfully forged.  \n4 \n \nIssues around the conceptualisation of partnership working in public health are taken up in a related \npaper. (see Perkins et al, under review) \n \nEvidence Synthesis \nSystematic review methodology enables researchers to establish the full extent and quality of \nresearch evidence on a given question, to highlight gaps in the evidence-base and thus inform the \ndirection of future research. Indeed, in pointing to the need for better evidence on the effects of public \nhealth interventions, the second Wanless Report emphasised the importance of systematic reviews.\n14\n  \nGiven the status of partnership working, our systematic review of the health impacts of public health \npartnerships (funded by the NIHR NHS Service and Delivery Organisation Programme) should be \nbeneficial and timely to policymakers and researchers.   \n   \nMETHODS \nThe review set out to identify both quantitative (longitudinal before and after designs) and qualitative \nempirical studies (including \u201eviews\u201f studies\n15\n) that examined the impact of organisational partnerships \non public health outcomes (health improvement and\/or a reduction in health inequalities) in England. \nThe review focuses solely on England for two reasons.  First, it is part of a larger study of partnerships \ninvolving Local Area Agreements, which do not exist elsewhere in the UK.  Second, and more \nimportantly, the significant variations in the organisation and structure of the public sector in the four \nconstituent UK countries suggest the experiences of partnership working are unlikely to be \ncomparable. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in Box 1. Eighteen electronic \ndatabases were searched from January 1997 to June 2008.  These covered academic research, local \nand central government studies and grey literature. Full details of the electronic databases and \nwebsites, and the keywords, and terms used to drive searches are available in Web Appendix 1. In \naddition, the bibliographies of all included studies were hand searched and information on \nunpublished or in-progress research was requested via author contact. \n \nIn total 1058 abstracts\/titles were located, of which 895 were excluded at the titles and abstract stage. \n163 papers were retrieved for full paper analysis with full data extraction conducted on 31 studies.  \nData were extracted and studies were critically appraised (KS\/NP) and independently checked \n5 \n \n(KJ\/CB). Any disagreements were resolved by joint re-examination.  Critical appraisal criteria for \nqualitative papers were adapted from Rees et al.\n16\n and Public Health Resource Unit\n17\n, whilst \nquantitative studies were appraised using criteria applied in previous systematic reviews of complex \npublic health interventions and existing guidance for the evaluation of non-randomised studies (Box \n2).\n18,19,20,21 \n The critical appraisal criteria were applied with respect to the general design of studies, \nonce it had been decided to include them (as opposed to being applied to the ability of studies to \naddress the systematic review question), and the results were used for descriptive purposes only, to \nhighlight variations in the quality of studies. No quality score was calculated. \n \nOf the 31 papers where data were extracted, 16 were excluded for one or both of the following \nreasons: (i) the study did not fulfil any quality appraisal criteria (n=5); or (ii) the study did not examine \noutcomes relating to health or health inequalities (n=10).  In relation to the quantitative evidence base, \nstudies which were not \u201ebefore and after\u201f designs were also excluded (n=1).  \n \nSynthesis \nNarrative synthesis was performed to combine the qualitative and quantitative evidence. Results are \ntabulated (Tables 1-3) as well as summarised in the following text.  \n \nRESULTS \nOnly 15 studies met the review criteria and specifically assessing the impact of partnership working on \npublic health outcomes was not the main focus of most of these (see \u201eLimitations of this Study\u201f).  This \nsupports previous claims that there is a dearth of research adequately exploring the impacts of \npartnership working and that persistent policy support for the concept is largely faith-based.\n2,27\n The \nstudies covered the following six interventions (described in Box 3): Health Action Zones (HAZs) \n(eight studies), Health Improvement Programmes (HImPs) (two studies), New Deal for Communities \n(two studies), Health Education Authority Integrated Purchasing Programme (HIPP) (one study), \nHealthy Living Centres (HLCs) (one study), and National Healthy School Standard (NHSS) (one \nstudy).  Seven studies reported on direct health outcomes, whilst the others related to indirect \noutcomes (such as the profile of health inequalities, or the commissioning of new health improvement \ninterventions).  Two studies were largely quantitative, two used mixed methods, and the remainder \n6 \n \nwere largely qualitative (documentary analysis, semi-structured interviews and focus groups).  \nSummary details of the reviewed studies are available in Tables 1-3. \n \nHealth Action Zones (HAZs) \nOne quantitative and seven qualitative studies examined the impact of Health Action Zones (HAZs) on \noutcomes relating to public health and health inequalities. Five of these studies formed part of the \ncomplex, multi-faceted official national evaluation of HAZs, whilst the other three examined local HAZs \nor specific HAZ facilitated interventions (Table 1).  \n \nThe results which emerged from the national evaluation were somewhat inconclusive with regards to \nthe efficacy of partnership working (a finding which should be viewed in the context of the fact that \npartnership working was not the main focus of most of these studies and, in many cases, was \nreported as a successful outcome in and of itself).\n7,23,24-26,28-32\n  The quantitative study (a retrospective \nlongitudinal study of HAZ and non-HAZ areas matched by deprivation level)\n33\n compared local \nauthority level health data for one year prior to the HAZs (1997\/98) with data for two years post \n(2001\/02). This analysis produced some evidence to suggest that HAZs outperformed similarly \ndeprived non-HAZ areas in relation to all cause mortality and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality. \nFor example, for the 15-64 age group, CHD mortality decreased by 22% compared to 18.3% in \ncomparison areas. However, the findings were not consistent across all health indicators as mortality \nfrom accidental falls, for example, increased in by 31.34% in first wave HAZs even though some of \nthese areas had prioritised accident prevention programmes. Overall, the authors of the study \nconclude that the data \u201cdo not support the view that HAZs made greater improvements to population \nhealth than non-HAZ areas between 1997 and 2001\u201d.\n33\n Given the number of factors involved in HAZs \nin addition to partnership working (not least access to extra resources), the variation between HAZs \n(in terms of their chosen public health foci, their approach to partnership working and the contexts \nwithin which they were implemented), their short-term nature and the ever-shifting political context, it \nwould not be reasonable to conclude that HAZs provide a clear example of the failure of partnership \nworking to contribute to improved public health outcomes.  Furthermore, the accompanying qualitative \nstudy (interviews with HAZ managers and policy document analysis) reported that HAZs\u201f activities had \nat least made health inequalities more visible on local agendas.\n34\n   \n7 \n \n \nThree other qualitative studies (comprising interviews with HAZ managers and stakeholders, in \ncoordination with policy document analysis) of the national evaluation were included in this \nreview.\n28,29,32 \n They were limited in the extent to which they were able to discuss the success (or \notherwise) of HAZs as they all focused on the perceptions of individuals involved in implementing HAZ \nprogrammes, rather than the local populations whose health HAZs were intended to improve.  In two \nof these studies\n28,32\n respondents expressed the view that the impact of HAZs on health inequalities at \nthe time the data were gathered had been minimal or unclear, although both also claimed participants \nbelieved HAZs had helped \u201emainstream\u201f health inequalities (i.e. bring it to the attention of a range of \nindividuals and organisations)\n32\n or move it up the local policy agenda.\n28\n  All three of these studies \nwere deemed of a low methodological quality (see section (a) in Table 1), largely because not enough \ninformation was provided to assess fully the quality (i.e. to answer all of the questions in Box 1) but \nalso because the aims were either too vague or were not sufficiently addressed by the methodological \napproach (this was particularly the case for aims\/questions relating to the effect of the HAZs on health \ninequalities or other health outcomes). \n \nThe three studies included in the review which focused specifically on an individual case study HAZ,\n31\n \nor a specific type of project that had been facilitated by a HAZ\n35,36\n, made much greater claims to a \npublic health intervention effects (see section (b) in Table 1).  However, the critical appraisal process \nsuggested that the methodological quality of these studies was also generally low.   \n \nHealth Improvement Programmes (HImPs) \nTwo qualitative studies considered the impact of Health Improvement Programme (HImP) \npartnerships (Table 2).  The study by Powell et al.\n37\n reported that there was a lack of clarity amongst \nkey stakeholders in three case study HImPs about what partnership working could contribute to public \nhealth outcomes.  Similarly, in Benzeval and Meth\u201fs study,\n38\n managers reported they felt that, whilst \nHImP had moved health inequalities onto the agenda, there remained a need for a coherent strategic \nframework addressing inequalities to be built into local policy. The critical appraisal process suggested \nthat these studies were of a good quality, but they did not offer much information on health outcomes.  \n \n8 \n \nNew Deal for Communities (NDC) \nTwo high quality prospective studies evaluated New Deal for Communities (NDC) partnerships (Table \n2).\n39,40\n  Neither study found an intervention effect. The large-scale, mixed methods study (comprising \na large n longitudinal study of NDC areas and equivalently deprived non-NDC comparison areas, \nsecondary data analysis, documentary analysis, and 78 focus groups with participants)\n39\n reported \nsmall improvements in lifestyle indicators (e.g. smoking fell by 2% to 38%) and morbidity rates (1.93 to \n1.77, no p value) after three years. However, non-NDC areas experienced similar decreases.  The \nfocus group data suggested that residents believed that services had improved in the NDC areas.  \nSimilarly, the quantitative study (a longitudinal survey comparing NDC residents and non-NDC \nresidents in comparator areas matched for deprivation)\n40\n found that, although there were small \nimprovements in NDC areas (e.g. in relation to employment or smoking prevalence), these were \nmirrored in the comparison areas and so no consistent differences between intervention and \ncomparison areas for any health related outcomes were identified.  Residents with the lowest \neducational attainment and poorest health at baseline experienced the smallest improvements in \noutcomes. Again, these trends were also apparent in non-NDC areas, although the relationship \nbetween level of education and take-up of education\/training opportunities was less pronounced in \nNDC areas, suggesting that inequalities were \u201cgrowing less fast\u201d in areas covered by this intervention \ntype.\n40\n  However, as with HAZs, the complexity of NDC interventions and the number of other factors \ninvolved (such as the extra resources made available to these areas) make it impossible to conclude \nto what extent partnership working contributed (or not) to the differences in health outcomes observed \nin these studies. \n \nOther interventions  \nThree studies evaluated the following other types of partnership interventions:   The Health Education \nAuthority\u201fs Integrated Purchasing Programme (HIPP)\n41\n; Healthy Living Centres (HLCs)\n42\n; and the \nNational Healthy School Standard (NHSS)\n43\n (Table 3). \n \nHealth Education Authority\u2019s Integrated Purchasing Programme (HIPP) \nEvans and Killoran conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders involved in \nHIPP.\n41\n  There was little discussion of direct public health outcomes but, in terms of indirect outcomes, \n9 \n \nrespondents reported that health inequalities moved up local policy agendas. Little information was \ngiven about the methodological approach. \n \nHealthy Living Centres (HLCs) \nIn a large (n=1400) prospective, mixed methods study of HLCs, Hills et al. combined longitudinal \nsurvey data of users (comparing regular and non-regular HLC users) with focus groups of employees \nand managers.\n42\n The quantitative and qualitative data both suggested that regular attendance at \nHLCs was felt to help individuals adopt a healthier lifestyle and to sustain these healthy lifestyle \nchanges thereafter. For example, the survey of users found that regular users of HLCs did not \nexperience the marked decline in self-reported physical and mental health after follow-up that non-\nregular users experienced (physical health OR 1.24, [95% CI 0.27-2.22] p<0.05; mental health OR \n2.12, 95% CI [0.941-3.30] p<0.001) and that regular HLC attendance was associated with beneficial \noutcomes relating to smoking (OR 0.47 95% CI [0.28-0.78] p<0.01), physical activity (OR 1.34 [95% \nCI 1.03-1.74] p<0.05) and fruit\/vegetable consumption (5 daily portions, OR 1.58 [95% CI 1.20-2.08] \np<0.001). Non-significant differences in alcohol consumption were also reported. This was a fairly \ngood quality study, but the low follow-up response rate (31%) should be noted.  In the qualitative \ncomponent, respondents viewed HLCs as successful in engaging some of the most deprived sections \nof their local community, and felt that HLCs had an important protective health effect.  However, it was \nunclear precisely which aspects of HLCs contributed most to these positive assessments and, once \nagain, it is therefore difficult to conclude much about the role that partnership working played. \n \nNational Healthy School Standard (NHSS) \nAn evaluation of the National Healthy School Standard, a partnership involving the Department of \nHealth, the Department for Education and Skills and the Health Development Agency, employed \nmixed methods to assess the extent to which the NHSS was reducing health inequalities\n43\n.  However, \nonly the qualitative component met the systematic review inclusion criteria (the quantitative element \nwas cross-sectional, not longitudinal).  Interview data suggested that, in terms of indirect outcomes, \nthe NHSS partnership led to the introduction of specific health-related initiatives (such as drinking \nwater, addressing mental health and emotional well-being issues and healthy eating); raised \nawareness among local professionals of links between health and educational attainment; led to the \n10 \n \ndevelopment of named \u201ehealth governors\u201f in schools; and helped develop and implement a validation \nand accreditation process for healthy schools.  \n \n \nDISCUSSION \nMain findings of this study \nOverall our review has found that there is little evidence of the direct health effects of public health \npartnerships.  Where successes relating to public health outcomes were observed, it was extremely \ndifficult to assess the extent to which these were directly attributable to partnership working for the \nfollowing reasons.  First, \u201epartnership working\u201f was rarely adequately defined and many of the studies \nassumed that evidence of supportive attitudes to working in partnership were themselves a positive \noutcome and a proxy for success.  Second, the studies largely involved multifaceted interventions \nwhich did not rely solely upon partnership working and which often overlapped with other, similar \ninterventions, making it difficult to attribute outcomes directly to partnership working.  Third, many of \nthe studies reported that the public health aims of the interventions shifted during the lifetime of the \nintervention, with the consequence that initial methodological approaches were overtaken within the \nstudy period (a common problem with evaluating health policy\n44\n).  This was exacerbated by the short \ntime-spans and relatively small-scale of most of the interventions. \n \nIn addition, our study has found that the quality of the majority of studies was limited (see Box 4). Most \nwere relatively small-scale, qualitative evaluations, which focused on capturing the perceptions of \nmanagers and other actors involved in implementing the partnership-based interventions. To be able \nto determine whether or not an intervention is having an effect on the health of the target population, \neither a (large n, controlled) quantitative study design is required or a more sophisticated approach \nneeds to be taken to the qualitative evaluation, with more attention given to gathering data from the \nindividuals whose health the intervention is intended to improve.   Only four studies included a \nlongitudinal quantitative element (all with comparison areas\/groups) and they produced a mixed \npicture in terms of the impacts of partnership working: the retrospective HAZ evaluation was \ninconclusive with both positive and negative effects\n33\n, the two prospective NDC studies found no \ndifferences between intervention and comparison groups\n39,40\n; whilst the prospective evaluation of \n11 \n \nHLCs showed some positive effects on lifestyle factors\n42\n.  Although some of the qualitative studies \nsuggested that health inequalities moved up local policy agendas, they could not attribute causality, \nparticularly as the health inequalities were simultaneously being given more prominence in national \npolicy discourse. Further, there was very little evidence as to whether the health improvement \ninterventions initiated by partnerships would have been implemented regardless of the partnerships or \nwhether the interventions were able to continue after the partnerships ended.  \n \n \n \nWhat is already known on this topic \nThe majority of existing research on health partnerships focuses on health and social care, rather than \npublic health.\n2,45-51\n  In 2004, Dowling et al.\n2\n drew on this body of research in an attempt to \nconceptualise \u201esuccessful\u201f partnership working.  Although this article was not based on a systematic \nreview and did not focus on public health partnerships, it similarly concluded that very little was known \nabout the outcomes of partnerships.  This is despite the fact that a number of publications have \nattempted to draw out the key ingredients of \u201esuccessful\u201f partnership working.\n52-54\n This is because \nthese publications are all more concerned with the processes and ingredients conducive to the \nsuccess of partnership working (such as, for example, the need for high levels of trust between \npartners and clear, shared goals) than they are with exploring what their impact might be. It is possible \nthat some of these lessons are relevant to public health partnerships, and that partnerships which \nadhere to these recommendations may be in a better position to contribute to public health outcomes \nthan those which do not.  However, given the complex interdependencies involved in many public \nhealth issues\n55\n, this should not be assumed (assessing whether this is the case is the subject of \nanother paper\n56\n).  Specifically in relation to public health partnerships, Peckham\n57\n has reviewed \ndifferent types of partnerships but, whilst he concludes that \u201epartnership is a fundamental concept \nwhich underpins public health policy and action\u201f, he is unable to offer evidence as to their impact on \nhealth outcomes. \n \n \n \n12 \n \nWhat this study adds \nThis paper presents the results from the first systematic review of the evidence relating to the health \nimpacts of public health partnerships.  It demonstrates that, to date, very little is known about the \nhealth impacts of public health partnerships as they have not yet been rigorously evaluated.  Amongst \nthe studies that at least touch on this issue, there is an obvious lack of high quality qualitative \nresearch, particularly in terms of studies which engage with the views of those whose health the \ninterventions are intended to improve (Box 4).  Equally, there is a paucity of quantitative studies which \nassess the effects, and cost effectiveness, of partnership interventions. The few quantitative studies \nlocated were of variable methodological quality (Box 4).  This is perhaps not surprising given the \ncomplex nature of the interventions under review,\n58-60\n and the constantly changing organisational and \npolicy contexts,\n34,60,61\n as well as the pressure to produce rapid evidence of the efficacy of \ninterventions.\n23\n  Indeed, the difficulties in applying well designed, experimental methodological \napproaches to complex, area-based policy interventions have been widely discussed.\n44,59,62\n   \n \nNevertheless, if the health effects of partnerships are to be properly understood, more innovative \nmethodological approaches to studying their impact on health outcomes are required, preferably \ncombining quantitative (prospective, controlled) assessments of health outcomes with qualitative \nanalyses of target populations.  As discussed elsewhere,\n34,60\n studies of complex, area-based \ninterventions frequently report having been constrained by short-term policy time frames and \nconstantly changing demands from central government.  Hence, if an adequate evidence-base to \nbetter judge the impact of partnership working on public health is desired, those involved in funding \nand implementing partnership-based projects need to work with researchers to facilitate better quality \nand longer-term evaluations.   \n \nLimitations of this study \nSearching for studies on public health interventions is difficult and time-consuming and the search \nstrategies can often suffer from a lack of specificity. This was particularly problematic in this review \ndue to the popularity of the term partnership,\n27\n a lack of clarity about what is meant by this term, and \nthe diverse nature of public health.  This meant that it was not possible to employ broad search terms \nbecause the number of references returned became unmanageable. Hence, although we employed a \n13 \n \nbroad definition of public health partnerships in our inclusion criteria (Box 1), our search strategy (Web \nAppendix 1) may have missed relevant studies which looked at partnerships relating to public health \nissues but which did not specifically refer to public health, wellbeing, health improvement or health \ninequality.  However, to ensure that the searches were as extensive as possible, our strategies were \npiloted and revised and were conducted by an experienced librarian (EB). In addition, the \nbibliographies of all included studies were hand-searched and information on unpublished or in-\nprogress research was requested via author contact. Despite this, as for any review of complex and \ndifficult-to-define interventions, it is not possible to be sure that all relevant reviews have been \nlocated.\n63\n Further, our review focused exclusively on partnerships in England from 1997-2008. \nGeneralisation of the results to partnerships operating elsewhere should therefore only be undertaken \nwith caution.  \n \n \nCONCLUSION  \nThe current evidence-base on the effects of public health partnerships on health outcomes is partial \nand methodologically limited. The fact that evidence on the effectiveness of partnerships is lacking \ndoes not necessarily mean that they are ineffective but, without such evidence, it ought to be \nacknowledged that the benefits attributed to this way of working are largely presumed.  Given the far \nfrom insignificant costs associated with partnerships (both in terms of financial resources and staff \ntime) and their profusion in recent years, a comparative analysis of interventions and strategies with \nsimilar public health aims that have adopted partnership working as their modus operandi and\/or \nvivendi is urgently required.  A larger study, of which the systematic review reported here forms a key \ncomponent, seeks to address this issue through an exploration of a sample of LSPs that have \nproduced local area agreements (LAAs).  The LSPs and LAAs will be studied from the perspectives of \nboth those engaged in the partnerships and those who might be expected to benefit from their efforts.     \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to acknowledge Trevor Hopkins, Linda Marks and Tim Blackman who provided \ncomments on the search strategy.

To be included studies had to: \n Explicitly describe the public health partnership under evaluation or assess one of the key \nknown public health partnerships (such as LSPs, HAZs, Neighbourhood Renewal \nPartnerships, or HImPs); \n Involve partnerships based in England that were active between 1997 and 2008 (those \npartnerships which were terminated by (or during) 1997 were excluded); \n Contain data on the impact of organisational partnerships on public health outcomes (health \nimprovement and\/or a reduction in health inequalities) either directly (for example effects of \npartnerships, or partnership implemented interventions, on self-reported health) or indirectly \n(by, for example, raising the policy profile of health inequalities). \nPartnerships designed to improve clinical health outcomes, the control of infectious diseases or \noutcomes relating to the treatment of illnesses were not included.  Opinion or theoretical based \npapers that did not draw on empirical data were excluded, as were studies that only examined \nprocesses of working in partnership (as opposed to public health outcomes) and non-English \nlanguage papers.  \n \n16 \n \n \n \nBox 2: Critical appraisal criteria \n \nThese criteria were used to appraise all of the included studies with respect to their general design. \nThe results of this process are presented under the critical appraisal section of the results tables 1-3, \nwith the numbers 1-10 representing satisfactory fulfilment of the corresponding criterion. \n \nQualitative studies\n16,17\n  \n1) Is there a clear statement of the research question and aims? \n2) Was the methodology appropriate for addressing the stated aims of the study? \n3) Was the recruitment strategy appropriate and was an adequate sample obtained to support the \nclaims being made? \n4) Were the data collected in a way that addressed the research issue? \n5) Are the methods of data analysis appropriate to the subject matter? \n6) Is the description of the findings provided in enough detail and depth to allow interpretation of the \nmeanings and context of what is being studied? [Are data presented to support interpretations, etc?] \n7) Are the conclusions \/ theoretical developments justified by the results? \n8) Have the limitations of the study and their impact on the findings been considered? \n9) Is the study reflexive? [Do authors consider the relationship between research and participants \nadequately and are ethical issues considered?] \n10) Do researchers discuss whether or how the findings can be transferred to other contexts or \nconsider other ways in which the research may be used? \n \nQuantitative studies\n18-21\n  \n1) Is the study prospective? \n2) Is there a representative sample? \n3) Is there an appropriate control group? \n4) Is the baseline response greater than 60%? \n5) Is the follow-up greater than 80% in a cohort study or greater than 60% in a cross-sectional study? \n6) Have the authors adjusted for non-response and dropout? \n7) Are the authors\u201f conclusions substantiated by the data presented? \n8) Is there adjustment for confounders? \n9) Were the entire intervention group exposed to the intervention? Was there any contamination \nbetween the intervention and control groups? \n10) Were appropriate statistical tests used? \n \n \n17 \n \n \nBox 3: Descriptions of the main public health partnership interventions covered by the review \n \nAlthough the public health partnerships are described separately below, it should be noted that many overlapped \nwith one another both geographically and in terms of implementation timescales.\n64\n \n \nHealth Action Zones (HAZs)\n30-32\n \nHAZs were area based initiatives designed to tackle social exclusion and inequalities.  Acknowledging the wider \ndeterminants of health, HAZs were intended to develop partnership working between the NHS, local government \nand other sectors with the aim of tackling ill health and persistent inequalities in the most disadvantaged \ncommunities across the UK.  Initially 11 Health Action Zones were launched in the first wave in April 1998, \nfollowed by a further 15 HAZs in April 1999.  Collectively HAZs were awarded \u00a3320 million over a three-year \nperiod. Originally, it was intended that the lifespan of HAZs would last between five and seven years, with \nsuccessful services being mainstreamed thereafter.  However, HAZs were effectively wound down by 2003. The \nprojects facilitated by HAZs varied extensively but included initiatives which aimed to: address social and \neconomic determinants (e.g. services providing advice on benefit support\n35\n); promote healthy lifestyles (e.g. \nbreakfast clubs\n24\n); empower individuals and communities (e.g. Gypsy and Traveller Project Advisory Group\n25\n); \nand improve health and social care services (e.g. Integrated Substance Misuse Service\n31\n). \n \nHealth Improvement Programmes (HImPs)\n64\n \nHImPs are action plans developed by NHS and local government bodies working together.  They were \nintroduced in 1999 and, despite being re-named Health Improvement and Modernisation Plans in 2001, they \ncontinue to form a key approach to public health in England. The plans set out how these organisations (with, \nwhere deemed appropriate, voluntary and private sector input) intend to improve the health of local populations \nand reduce health inequalities.  The programmes offer a three year plan for identifying local health needs and \ndeveloping relevant strategies to improve health and health care services at a local level.  HImPs were founded \non the basis of multi-agency partnership working between local government and Strategic Health Authorities \n \nNew Deal for Communities (NDC)\n39,40\n \nAs part of the Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy, NDC was developed to tackle health and social inequalities \nexperienced by the 39 most deprived communities in the UK.  In partnership with local communities, NDC seeks \nto address embedded issues of deprivation and long term poverty by improving outcomes in terms of housing, \neducation, employment and health.  Interventions have mainly focussed on: promoting healthy lifestyles; \nenhancing service provision; developing the health workforce; and working with young people. \n \nHealth Education Authority\u2019s Integrated Purchasing Programme (HIPP)\n41\n \nThe Integrated Purchasing Programme was developed by the Health Education Authority and ran between 1996 \nand 1999.  The overall aim of the programme was to provide support for partnerships between local authorities, \nprimary care groups and health authorities in improving health.  Five demonstration projects were launched, \neach involving a local partnership to tackle health inequalities.  Other elements of the programme included a \nnational Practice Exchange Network, a learning and dissemination programme and a knowledge resource base. \n \nHealthy Living Centres (HLCs)\n42\n \nHLCs were introduced in 1998 to tackle the broader determinants of health inequalities and to improve health \nand wellbeing at a local level.  Funding was awarded for 352 community projects which varied in terms of focus, \nranging from service-related issues to activities addressing unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.  \nPartnership working was presented as an underpinning concept of HLCs.  Example interventions included health \nfocused projects such as a physical activity outreach programme in rural localities, support programmes such as \na Community Health Information Project which trained members of the local community to act as ambassadors \nfor HLCs, and services such as \u201eBumps to babies\u201f which provided midwifery and health visiting services for \nyoung families. Although some HLCs still exist, a lack of clarity with regards to funding means the future of many \nHLCs is unclear. \n \nNational Healthy School Standard (NHSS)\n43\n \nThe National Healthy School Standard is led by a partnership between the Department of Health, the \nDepartment for Education and Skills and the Health Development Agency. It has three key objectives: to raise \npupil achievement; to promote social inclusion; and to contribute to reducing health inequalities.   \n \n18 \n \nBox 4: Quality of the evidence \nMany of the qualitative studies lacked clear and well focused objectives and the methodologies were often \npoorly reported, with sparse data on numbers of participants, a non-comprehensive sampling strategy and a \nlack of information on the process of gathering and analysing data.  In addition, few original data were \nincluded to support the authors\u201f interpretations.  Consequently, in a number of instances it was difficult to \nassess whether the conclusions were fully justified.  Perhaps most significantly though, the vast majority of the \nstudies examined the views of those involved in partnership working (e.g. public health managers or \ncommissioners, who may have had an interest in providing a positive assessment of the intervention), rather \nthan those potentially affected by them (i.e. the local population). \n \nSimilarly, the quantitative studies reviewed were subject to a number of limitations relating to methodological \napproach.  Given the type of interventions under review and the intended effects on public health outcomes, \nthe follow-up period was relatively short (<2 years in all cases).  In one instance the findings were \ncompromised by the use of an inappropriate control as well as a low follow-up rate.\n42\n  Possible contamination \nbetween intervention and control groups was a cause for concern in two other studies.\n39,40\n  Finally, there were \nno studies of the cost-effectiveness of partnerships, which is a notable lacuna given the high costs of \npartnership working (e.g. HAZs cost \u00a3320 million\n30\n).  \n \n19 \n \nTable 1: Summary of studies of HAZ interventions \nStudy Methods Critical \nAppraisal* \nKey findings \n \n(a) National HAZ interventions \nBauld et al., \n2005 \n33\n \nQuantitative: Secondary analysis \nof routinely collected data from \nthe Compendium of Clinical and \nHealth Indicators (comparing \nintervention and comparison \nareas longitudinally). \n2,3,10 Improvement in all cause mortality \nand CHD mortality in HAZ areas \n(e.g. in 15-64 age group CHD \nmortality decreased by 22% in \nsecond wave HAZs compared with \n18.3% in deprived non-HAZ LAs). \nFindings not consistent, however, as \nmortality from accidental falls \nincreased by 31.3% in first wave \nHAZs compared with 17.1% in \ncomparator areas, despite a focus \non accident prevention in some of \nthese areas.
