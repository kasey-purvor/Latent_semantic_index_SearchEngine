Reflections\non the interface between social\nscience, epidemiology and public\nhealth\nClare Bambra\nExciting intellectual discoveries often hap-\npen on the boundaries between academic\ndisciplines. Historically, the interface\nbetween epidemiology and social science\nhas clearly been one of the most fruitful as\nit has enabled the \u2018\u2018fusion of data with\nideas\u2019\u2019:1 epidemiology has developed and\nrefined sophisticated methods of data\ncollection, while the diverse and fluid\nsocial sciences have offered multiple the-\nories through which such data can be\ninterpreted and applied. Combining epi-\ndemiological methods with social science\ntheories has thus unleashed the potential\nto both describe and explain the nature of\npopulation health. The subdiscipline of\nsocial epidemiology (the study of the\nsocial distribution and social determinants\nof health) is probably the most prominent\noutcome of the interface. The combina-\ntion of social science theories and epide-\nmiological methods has resulted in a\nstrong and widely accepted view that\nthe most important determinants of\ninequalities in health are social, economic\nand political,2\u20134 and that the solutions to\nhealth inequality also lie in the social,\npolitical and economic fields. This has\ninevitably resulted in the promotion of\nupstream policy interventions as the best\nway of improving population health and\nreducing health inequalities.5 The interac-\ntion with social science has thereby\nenabled epidemiology to move beyond\nthe proximate and embrace the study of\nthe more macro determinants of health\nand disease.6\nOn the social science side, the increased\ninteraction with epidemiology has largely\nresulted in a quantitative turn, perhaps\nepitomised by the emergence of the\nevidence-based policy movement, in\nwhich the \u2018\u2018robust\u2019\u2019 medical model of\nevidence was integrated into social science\nenquiry.7 However, although there have\nbeen clear positive outcomes of this\nprocess in terms of how social scientists\nexamine the social world and underpin\n(and test) their theories, it has not been\nwithout cost. Along with the methodolo-\ngical tools has come the engrained caution\nand purism of epidemiology. This has\naltered how social scientists promote their\nideas, as any statement on how to tackle\nhealth inequalities or improve public\nhealth must now be underpinned by\nevidence or it is considered merely worth-\nless rhetoric.\nOn the surface, the importance of using\nresearch evidence to underpin policy is\ndifficult to argue with. However, the\nproblem is that the conceptualisation of\nevidence is very restrictive and refers\nalmost exclusively to experimental evi-\ndence. This self-imposed focus on the\nexperimental and the \u2018\u2018ideal type\u2019\u2019 of\nevidence has placed huge, and damaging,\nlimitations on what it is possible to say\nabout \u2018\u2018what works\u2019\u2019 in terms of reducing\nhealth inequalities or improving popula-\ntion health. Experimental evaluations of\ninterventions have tended to examine the\neffectiveness of downstream, largely phar-\nmaceutical, medical or other individual-\nlevel interventions.8 It is therefore possible\nto make evidence-based statements about,\nfor example, the effects of smoking\ncessation services or beta-blockers on\nhealth inequalities, as there is (experi-\nmental) evidence available. In contrast, as\nthere is a dearth of experimental evidence\nrelating to the social determinants of\nhealth, it follows that there is very little\nthat can be said about how more\nupstream interventions affect health or\ninequalities in health.9 This so-called\n\u2018\u2018evidence gap\u2019\u2019, and the inevitable wait\nfor experimental studies to fill it, has\nenabled and legitimised an excessive\namount of sitting on the fence by both\nepidemiologists and social scientists with\nregard to what can be done\u2014now\u2014in\nterms of reducing health inequalities by\naddressing their social determinants.\nThis is despite the fact that there is a\nwealth of non-experimental evidence on\nthe effects of interventions, as well as\nobservational studies that, by highlighting\nassociations, say, between social inequal-\nity and excess morbidity and mortality,\nimplicitly suggest possible interventions,\nmost notably income redistribution.10 We\nare therefore in danger of throwing out\nthe baby with the bathwater, as making\nrecommendations for policy based on\nnon-experimental study designs (never\nmind the qualitative research favoured\nby many social scientists) is beyond the\npale for the majority of epidemiologists\nand, unfortunately, this now also seems\nto be the case for those social scientists\nwho examine health. The \u2018\u2018public intel-\nlectual\u2019\u2019 has been replaced by a new breed\nof evidence-ologists who fetishise data\nand are unprepared to talk beyond them.11\nWe should use our academic freedom to\nagitate more clearly and less self-con-\nsciously for action on the wider determi-\nnants of health: the purpose of research is\nnot just to describe the world but to\nchange it. The radical public health\nreformers of the past (who campaigned\nfor sanitation, free healthcare and the\nwelfare state) did not wait for experimen-\ntal evidence, they acted\u2014on the basis that\nsuch macro-level universal interventions\nimproved overall health, while being of\nmost benefit to the poorest in society.\nThe next stage in the interface between\nsocial science and epidemiology (or in the\nstruggle between ideas and data) is there-\nfore to be less cautious and self-censoring,\nmore open to the methods and\napproaches of the social sciences, more\nresponsive to the urgency of the issues\nand, ultimately, to reaffirm the radical\nrole of public health. Those working\nacross both disciplines (myself included)\nneed to be more pragmatic and more\nprepared to extrapolate findings and take\nintuitive leaps in terms of advancing\naction on health inequalities: in short,\nwe must be prepared to stick our necks\nout and make clear statements about\npositive findings.12 There is also a need\nto be less politically na\u0131\u00a8ve when it comes\nto the policy process: it is not a simple\ncase of evidence in and then policy out.13\nThere is therefore a need to engage with\n(and, where necessary, challenge) the\nideas and discourses at play in politics,\npolicy and the public health community,\nand to link up with campaign groups in\ncivil society.\nAn ideological vacuum is emerging in\nthe wake of the current crisis of capital-\nism, and so it may well be an appropriate\nCorrespondence to: Dr C Bambra, Department of\nGeography, Wolfson Research Institute, Queen\u2019s\nCampus, Durham University, Stockton on Tees TS17\n6BH, UK; clare.bambra@durham.ac.uk\nEditorial\nJ Epidemiol Community Health November 2009 Vol 63 No 11 867\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nmoment to reassert the upstream\nsocial determinants agenda.
