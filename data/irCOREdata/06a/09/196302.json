The objective of this study was to develop systems to allow \nbronchodilators nebulised by a breath enhanced jet nebuliser and a vibrating mesh nebuliser \nto be delivered to patients in Heliox.  This was achieved by attaching a reservoir to the \nnebulisers to ensure inhaled Heliox was not diluted by entrained air.  For the vibrating mesh \nnebuliser, the total output was significantly higher after 5min nebulisation when Heliox rather \nthan air was used as the delivery gas (p<0.001).  The proportion of drug in particles <5\u00b5m \nwas 58.1% for Heliox and 50.1% when air was entrained.  When the breath enhanced \nnebuliser was used a much higher driving flow of Heliox, compared to air, was required to \ndeliver a similar dose of drug (p<0.05).  The total amount of drug likely to be inhaled was \nsignificantly higher when the vibrating mesh nebuliser (Aerogen) was used compared to the \nbreath enhanced jet nebuliser (Pari LC plus) (p<0.001).  The amount of drug likely to be \ninhaled was also significantly greater for the adult as opposed to paediatric breathing pattern \nfor all nebulisers and flows tested with the exception of the Aeroneb and Heliox entrainment. \nIn this case, total amounts were similar for both patterns but for the paediatric pattern, the \ntime taken to reach this output was longer.  Such information is required to allow appropriate \ninterpretation of clinical trials of drug delivery using Heliox. \n 3 \nINTRODUCTION \n \nHeliox is a mixture of helium and oxygen and is less dense than air. It has the advantage, due \nto its low density, of reducing resistance in airways with turbulent flow (1).  Benefits when \nHeliox is inhaled include improved ventilation and enhanced removal of CO2 (2; 3).   The \nproperties of Heliox also make it an attractive carrier gas for drug aerosols in patients with \nairways obstruction to improve lung deposition (4).  However, clinical trials where Heliox has \nbeen used in an attempt to improve aerosol drug delivery have produced variable results (5).  \nSome of this variability may be explained by dilution of Heliox with air when patients \n inhale (6).   \n \nJet nebulisers are driven by a pressurised gas.  When a patient inhales, they will inhale drug \naerosol carried in the gas used to drive the nebuliser.  The patient\u2019s inhalational flow, \nhowever, is likely to be considerably higher than the flow of gas directly from the nebuliser.  \nThey will, therefore, entrain surrounding room air diluting the pressurised gas (7).  If Heliox \nwas used as the pressurised gas, the dilution from entrained room air will increase the density \nof the gas inhaled thereby reducing its potential benefit.  To maintain the concentration of \nHeliox inhaled, both the gas used to run the nebuliser and the gas entrained should be Heliox.  \nIn general, studies in which a reservoir system containing Heliox was added to the nebuliser \nsystem to ensure all of the entrained air was also Heliox have shown clinical benefits such as \nimprovements in spirometry, together with lower rates of hospital admission (8-10).  Studies \nwhere the investigators did not describe the use of a reservoir system for Heliox have \ngenerally shown no benefit (11-13).  Interpretation of clinical trials using Heliox for nebulised \ndrug delivery is also hindered by the lack of data on the effect of the gas on the particle size \nof the drug aerosol.  To allow informed interpretation of drug delivery studies, detailed \n 4 \ninformation on the delivery system including the use of reservoir systems (6), particle size \nanalysis of the drug aerosol (14)and the effect of breathing pattern on drug likely to be \n inhaled (15) are essential. \n \nThe aim of this study was to design and evaluate in a laboratory environment systems that \nallowed delivery of aerosolised drug  in Heliox 21 (79% Helium and 21% Oxygen) generated \nby a vibrating mesh nebuliser and a conventional breath-enhanced jet nebuliser driven by \nHeliox.  We also determined the effect of paediatric and adult breathing patterns on the \namount of drug likely to be inhaled and the particle size of the aerosols produced.  As the \ndensity of Heliox is significantly less than air, the impactor used was recalibrated to ensure \nappropriate measurements were obtained. \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nNebulisers \n \nNebulisers used in this study were the Pari LC Plus (Pari GmbH, Starnberg, Germany, Part \nNo 022G8003) and the Aeroneb Professional Nebuliser System (Aeroneb Pro) from Aerogen \n(Ireland) Limited. \n \nGases \n \nGases used in this study were Heliox 21 (HX cylinder with integral valve), a mixture of 21% \noxygen and 79% helium, from BOC.  It was used with an external Heliox flow meter (Amvex \n 5 \nCorporation Heliox 21% oxygen, FMA 0331; calibrated from 1 \u2013 16L\/min flow) attached to \nthe Heliox BS 6582 Schraeder outlet.    \n \nThe other gas used was medical air, also from BOC.  An air flowmeter (OHMEDA Serial No \nAKG U03143), calibrated for flows 1-15L\/min, was attached to the cylinder. \n \nA Furness Micromanometer (a sensitive pressure measuring device) and pneumotach \ncalibrated with a 0-20L\/min Rotameter (Fisher Controls Ltd, Croydon) were used for the \nmeasurement of flows.  \n \nDrug used \n \nSalbutamol for nebulisation was Salamol (5mg\/2.5ml) Steri-Neb nebuliser solution \n(Salbutamol sulphate nebules, Baker-Norton).  Salbutamol reference standard material was \nSalbutamol base from GlaxoSmithKline (Product No AH3365) with a purity of 99.1% w\/w \n(HPLC).  Salbutamol was recovered from the filters and NGI stages using 75% methanol and \nquantified using a previously validated internal standard HPLC assay (16).   \n \nMatching Heliox to the patient\u2019s inhalational flow  \n \nOne of the principle aims of the study was to ensure that patients would inhale Heliox that \nwas not diluted by surrounding air. \n \nPari LC Plus: On inhalation from the Pari LC plus, a one-way valve opens at the top of the \nnebuliser allowing extra air to be entrained through the device.  On exhalation, positive \npressure within the nebuliser causes this valve to close.  This results in additional air passing \n 6 \nthrough the nebuliser on inspiration enhancing drug delivery to the patient (17).  To ensure the \npatient inhaled only Heliox 21, the top of the nebuliser was attached to a 100 litre non-\ndiffusing gas collection bag (Hans Rudolf Inc, Canada City, Missouri, USA) filled with \nHeliox.  This was used in conjunction with a one-way respiratory valve (patented Spiral-type \ndiaphragm, Hans Rudolf Inc) fitted into the 35 mm bore of the bag\u2019s primary adaptor (Figure \n1).   The nebuliser was run using Heliox 21.  For experiments where Heliox was not used, the \nbag was filled with air and medical air (from a cylinder) used to run the nebuliser.   \n \nAerogen: The Aerogen produces aerosol by vibration of a mesh that is in contact with the \ndrug solution and therefore no driving gas is required.  To ensure the entire drug aerosol \nproduced was carried in Heliox, one end of the nebuliser \u2018T\u2019 piece was connected to the gas \nreservoir bag filled with Heliox (Figure 2).  When comparisons were made to delivery using \nair, the bag was filled with a similar amount of air. \n \nEffect of breathing pattern on drug delivery: \n \nThe total amount of drug available for inhalation was measured using a computer controlled \nPari Sinus Breathing Simulator (Pari GmbH, Starnberg, Germany).  This allows simulated \ntidal volume, respiratory rate and respiratory time to be independently adjusted.  Two \ndifferent breathing patterns were used - the paediatric pattern (tidal volume of 150mL, 20 \nbreaths per min and an inspiratory fraction of 40%) and the adult pattern (tidal volume of \n600mL, 12 breaths per min and an inspiratory fraction of 40%).  A Pari electrostatic filter \n(inspiratory) was placed in a holder via a Y-connector between the simulator and the \nnebuliser to capture the drug likely to be inhaled.  A second filter (expiratory) was also \nattached to this Y-piece to allow capture of the expelled dose. \n 7 \n \nThe gas reservoir bag (filled with either air or Heliox 21) was attached via the one-way valve \nto the top of the Pari LC Plus nebuliser and secured with nescofilm.  In the case of the \nAeroneb Pro nebuliser, the bag and valve were attached, via a suitable connector, to the end \nof the Aeroneb\u2019s T-piece.  \n \nNebulisers were filled with the contents of a nebule (Salamol, 5mg\/2.5mL).  Nebulisation \ntook place for 5min at the appropriate breathing pattern.   \n \nStudies were performed using the following combinations for both the paediatric and adult \nbreathing patterns:   \n\u2022 Pari LC Plus driven by 4 and 6 L\/min air, (measured by calibrated flow meter attached to \nthe air cylinder), entraining air from reservoir bag.  A flow of 6L\/min was the maximum \nrecommended for this nebuliser; higher flows result in a build-up of back pressure \ncausing disconnection of the gas supply tubing. \n\u2022 Pari LC Plus driven by 6, 12 and 15 L\/min Heliox (measured by calibrated flow meter \nattached to Heliox cylinder), entraining Heliox from the reservoir bag.  The lower density \nof Heliox relative to air means that higher flows of Heliox are required to produce an \naerosol of similar size to that produced by the same flow of air (6). \n\u2022 Aeroneb entraining air from the reservoir bag. \n\u2022 Aeroneb entraining Heliox from the reservoir bag. \nPilot data for the Pari suggested that a Heliox flow of 12L\/min gave a similar amount of drug \nin particles <5\u03bcm as seen for the same nebuliser when driven by air at 6L\/min.  A flow of \n6L\/min Heliox was chosen as a similar flow to 6L\/min air for direct comparison.  While \n 8 \n15L\/min was chosen to represent a higher flow that 12L\/min and an upper limit of flow, in \npractical terms.  \nEach experiment was repeated on at least four occasions.  Drug deposited on the 5min \ninspiratory filters was recovered by dissolution into an appropriate solution and quantified by \nHPLC.  The method of drug recovery from the filters was validated and found to be >97%.  \nMass balance determinations were carried out for all runs.  A nebulisation time of 5min was \nchosen as determined from previous studies most of the drug has been nebulised within 5min \nand this is an acceptable time for patients to inhale from a nebuliser (18). \nHowever, single experiments were also performed to determine the end of nebulisation time.  \nThis is considered to be the end of effective nebulisation.   The cessation of nebulisation was \ntaken as 1min after the beginning of sputtering (19).  For all experiments, the amounts of drug \ncaptured on the inspiratory filters at the end of nebulisation were determined. \nParticle sizing experiments: \n \nParticle size was measured using the Next Generation Impactor (NGI, 7 stage with micro \norifice collector: Model 170, MSP Corporation, Shore View, MN, USA).  An external Pari \nelectrostatic filter was present at the outlet of the impactor, as the final stage of the NGI, to \ncollect ultra-fine particles and to protect the pump.  The NGI was pre-cooled prior to each \nexperiment to minimise evaporated losses as previously described by Berg and Asking (20).  \nFor experiments with air, the flow through the NGI was set at 15 L\/min (21).   \n \nEffective cut-off diameters (ECD) for the impactor stages have already been determined for \nair at 15 L\/min (Marple et al, 2004) to allow use of this impactor with nebuliser systems.   \nThe impactor was recalibrated for the use of Heliox using the equation from Newton (22).  \nCut-offs were calculated for each stage of the NGI for Heliox at a flow of 15 L\/min through \n 9 \nthe impactor, ie: ECD (\u00b5m) = 1.233 x 104 (N\u03b7W3\/Q) \u00bd where ECD is the effective cut-off \ndiameter, N is the number of jet stages, \u03b7 is the gas viscosity, W is the diameter of the stage \njets and Q is the gas flow.   \nTable 1 summarises the calculations of the ECDs for Heliox.  For comparison, the ECDs for \nair are also included. \nThese cut-offs for Heliox were 18.79, 9.17, 5.50, 3.32, 2.03, 1.27 and 0.82\u00b5m for stages 1-7, \nrespectively.  \n \nTo set the flow of Heliox at 15L\/min through the impactor the following method was \nemployed.  Output from the calibrated flow meter attached to the Heliox 21 cylinder was \ndirectly connected to the Furness Micromanometer via a pneumotach.  A flow of 15L\/min \nproduced a specific reading on the Micromanometer that was recorded.  Experiments were \nset-up with the pneumotach in place and with a reservoir bag (full of Heliox) attached.  The \nvacuum pump attached to the end of the NGI was switched on and adjusted until the reading \non the Micromanometer was equivalent to a Heliox flow of 15L\/min. \n \nThe top of the Pari nebuliser was again attached to the reservoir bag filled with either air or \nHeliox to ensure no dilution with surrounding room air.  In all cases, the driving gas matched \nthe gas in the reservoir bag.  For the Aerogen, the reservoir was connected to the T- piece. \n \nFor particle sizing experiments nebulisation time was 3 minutes in all cases and quadruplicate \nmeasurements were made.  Salbutamol was recovered from all stages of the NGI and external \nfilter using methanol as a solvent and quantified by HPLC.  The amount of drug contained in \nparticles <3\u00b5m and <5 \u00b5m was calculated.  The mass median aerodynamic diameter \n(MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) were also determined. \n 10 \n \nIn our experiments, the mass of drug collecting in the throat and depositing on the first stage \nof the NGI were not included in the determination of aerosol properties, such as, MMAD and \nGSD.  However, the drug collecting in these components was considered for the purpose of \ncharacterising the total cloud from the nebuliser, i.e.: when calculating the amount and \npercentage of drug in particles <6\u00b5m, <5\u00b5m and <3\u00b5m. \n \nCombining the total output of drug at 5min from the breathing simulation analyses with the \nparticle-sizing data (% particles <5\u00b5m and <3\u00b5m) allowed the estimation of the amount of \ndrug likely to be inhaled that is contained within various particle size fractions. \n \nStatistical Analysis: \n \nA series of two-way ANOVAs with Bonferroni post-tests were performed on the breathing \nsimulation data and on the results for the amount of drug (\u00b5g) in particles <5\u00b5m.  A series of \none-way ANOVAs were performed on the percentage of drug in particles <5\u00b5m.   \n \nRESULTS:  \n \nFigures 3 and 4 show the total outputs to the breathing simulator filter after 5min nebulisation \nfor the adult and paediatric breathing patterns, respectively, and the amounts of salbutamol \ncalculated from our results to be in particles <5\u00b5m and <3\u00b5m. \nResults for the amounts of drug captured on the inspiratory filters (representing the total \namount of drug available for inhalation) after 5min and at the end of nebulisation, together \nwith the times to dryness, are shown in Table 2 for both breathing patterns. \n 11 \n \nIn all experiments, output with the adult breathing pattern was significantly higher \n(p<0.0001) than with the paediatric pattern, with the exception of the Aeroneb and Heliox \nentrainment.  In this case, total amounts were similar for both patterns but for the paediatric \npattern, the time taken to reach this output was longer. \n \nUsing the Pari with air at 4 and 6L\/min, the total outputs and amounts of drug in particles \n<5\u00b5m were similar (p>0.05).  \n \nUsing the Pari with Heliox at 12 or 15L\/min gave a higher total output with the adult \nbreathing pattern (p<0.05) compared to 6L\/min.  The proportion of drug in particles <5\u00b5m \nincreased with higher flows for both breathing patterns (p<0.001).  \n \n \nUsing the Aeroneb with entrained Heliox resulted in higher total drug output after 5min \nnebulisation compared to when air was entrained (p<0.001).  For the Aeroneb with entrained \nair, 50.1% of the aerosol cloud contained drug in particles <5\u03bcm.  When Heliox was the \nentrainment gas, this proportion increased to 58.1%.  \n \nTotal drug outputs for the Aeroneb for both breathing patterns were significantly higher as \ncompared to the Pari after 5min nebulisation (p<0.001).  These differences were maintained \nuntil the end of effective nebulisation. \n \n 12 \nThe amounts of drug calculated to be in particles <5\u00b5m were significantly higher for the \nAeroneb with Heliox entrainment, for both breathing patterns, as compared to all other \ncombinations (p<0.001). \n \n \n \nMMADs for the Pari at flows of 4 and 6 L\/min of air were 3.8 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b5m (Mean \u00b1 S.D.) and \n2.9 \u00b1 0.18 \u00b5m respectively.  For the Aeroneb with air entrainment the MMAD was 4.5 \u00b1 0.13 \n\u00b5m.  MMADs for the Pari at flows of 6, 12 and 15 L\/min with Heliox as driving gas were \n3.62 \u00b1 0.08\u00b5m, 1.7 \u00b1 0.18\u00b5m and 1.47 \u00b1 0.3\u00b5m respectively.  For the Aeroneb with Heliox \nentrainment, the MMAD was 3.99 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b5m. \n \nDISCUSSION \nIn this study, we designed and evaluated laboratory based systems that allowed delivery of a \nnebulised  bronchodilator in Heliox, undiluted by the surrounding air. . \nWe studied two different types of nebuliser.  The Pari LC Plus is a breath-enhanced nebuliser \nthat is commonly used in a home and hospital setting for the delivery of aerosolised \nmedications to patients.  By attaching a reservoir of Heliox to the top of the nebuliser, \nentrained gas and thus all gas likely to be inhaled was Heliox.  The vibrating mesh nebuliser \nwas chosen due to the lack of need for a driving gas.  The reservoir containing Heliox was \nattached to the T-piece of the device ensuring all gas likely to be inhaled was Heliox.  Using \nthese systems with a breathing simulator, replicating an adult and paediatric breathing \npattern, we were able to determine the amount of drug likely to be inhaled with these \nbreathing patterns.  The drug likely to be inhaled was determined by assaying filters placed \nbetween the nebuliser and the breathing replicator.  It must be remembered that this is a \n 13 \nlaboratory estimate of the total dose inhaled and does not necessarily represent the dose \nreaching the lower respiratory tract.  We found Heliox significantly affected the amount of \ndrug likely to be inhaled, compared to air, from both devices.  For the Aeroneb vibrating \nmesh nebuliser the total output was significantly higher when Heliox rather than air was used \nas the delivery gas.  We speculate that Heliox causes less internal losses within the drug \ndelivery devices.  When the breath-enhanced nebuliser was used, a much higher driving flow \nof Heliox, compared to air, was required to deliver a similar dose of drug.   \nOur results concentrate on the output of drug in the first 5min of nebulisation.  From previous \nwork, the majority of nebulisation takes place in 5min and this is also considered an \nacceptable time for the patient to breathe from a nebuliser (18).  We also report on the amount \nof drug released at the end of effective nebulisation.  The proportions of drug released at the \nend of effective nebulisation did not differ significantly from those at 5min.  The main \nexception was the Aeroneb with Heliox entrainment for the adult breathing pattern.  In this \ncase, the majority of drug was delivered within 5min.  When the Aeroneb and air entrainment \nwere used with the same breathing pattern, drug continued to be released for a further 2min. \nAs expected, the amount of drug inhaled for the adult breathing pattern was significantly \ngreater than when the paediatric pattern was used.  The only exception was the Aeroneb when \nused with entrained Heliox.  In this case, the total amount delivered for a paediatric breath \npattern was similar for an adult breath simulation, although the time taken to reach this output \nwas longer.  These results confirm the importance of breathing pattern to determine drug \ndelivery from nebulisers (23) . \n \n  \n \n 14 \nThe use of a reservoir system, ensuring Heliox inhaled by a patient is not diluted by entrained \nair, appears crucial to its effectiveness as a carrier gas for bronchodilator aerosols (6). It has \nbeen hypothesised that the lower density of Heliox would result in less turbulent flow and, \nthus, improve drug delivery to the lungs in patients with airways obstruction.  Dilution of the \nHeliox by air would increase the density of the gas inhaled and, if dilution was significant, \nnegate the potentially beneficial effects of Heliox.  Studies in adults with stable asthma (9) and \nduring exacerbations (8), where a reservoir of Heliox was used, ensuring no dilution of the \ngas, showed improvements in lung function compared to air.  Use of a reservoir system for \nHeliox also showed benefits in a paediatric emergency room study in terms of early discharge \nand patient symptom scores (10).  Studies where patients entrained surrounding room air that \ndiluted the Heliox used to drive the nebuliser, have generally failed to show benefit (11-13).   \n  \nFor effective therapy, it is also crucial that the aerosolised drug be contained in particles that \nare likely to reach the lower respiratory tract (15).  We were surprised, therefore, that the \nmajority of clinical studies evaluating nebulisation with Heliox failed to study its effect on \naerosol particle size.  To evaluate particle size we used the Next Generation Impactor.  This \nimpactor has been calibrated at flows of both 15 and 30 litres\/minute (21), the former chosen \nas the optimal flow for assessment of the particle size distribution from nebulisers.  As flow \nthrough an impactor depends on the density of the gas, recalibration is required if a different \ngas is used.  In this study we used an impactor flow of 15L\/minute and calculated the cut-off \ndiameters for the individual stages of the impactor using the equation derived by Newton and \ncolleagues (22).  In the one clinical study where particle size was measured, there is no \nmention of calibration of the impactor used to cater for the lower density of Heliox. \n \n 15 \nWhen jet nebulisers are used the lower density of Heliox relative to air means that higher \nflows of Heliox are required to produce an aerosol of similar size to that produced by the \nsame flow of air (24; 25).  Our results support these findings with significantly less salbutamol \navailable for inhalation in small particles (<5\u00b5m) when the Pari jet nebuliser was run by \nHeliox at 6L\/min compared to air at the same flow.  Increasing the flow to 12L\/min Heliox \nincreased output of drug in small particles towards that of the Pari jet nebuliser run using air \nat 6L\/min.  There was no advantage of using a higher flow of Heliox of 15L\/min.  Total \noutput of drug was also significantly less at the lowest flow of Heliox (6L\/min) compared to a \nsimilar flow of air.  \nAs expected, an increase in Heliox flow with the Pari resulted in a decrease in the MMAD of \nthe aerosol, from 3.6\u00b5m at 6L\/min to 1.7\u00b5m at 15L\/min.   From our results, a flow of 6L\/min \nof Heliox for the Pari is clearly not optimal in terms of total drug output and particle-size \ndistribution.  As expected, the MMAD when Heliox was used to drive the Pari was greater \nthan when air was used at the same flow.  This is consistent with the results of Corcoran and \nco-workers (24).  They used a Hudson Micromist nebuliser run with air at 8L\/min and \nHeliox(70\/30) at 8L\/min using saline sprays and found a higher MMAD (4.3\u00b5m) for Heliox \ncompared to 3.8\u00b5m for air.  Testing the Pari at high flows of air equivalent to those of Heliox \nwas not possible due to practical limitations.       \nOur results differ from a study by Hess and colleagues (1) who found increasing the flow of \nHeliox use to drive the nebuliser resulted in an increase in the particle size (MMAD) of the \ndrug aerosol.  The reasons for this are not clear as, in general, increasing the driving flow \nthrough a nebuliser usually results in a smaller particle-size.  If the flow is too high, spitting \nof large particles may occur which could affect the particle-size distribution analysis.  \nAnother factor was the lack of a reservoir of Heliox in their study.  They determined aerosol \n 16 \nparticle-size using an 11- stage cascade impactor at a flow of 2 litres\/minute that was \nrecalibrated for Heliox.   \n \n \nOur results give an estimate of the effect of Heliox on the likely dose of drug inhaled and the \namount contained in particles likely to reach the lung.  Such information is crucial to plan \nclinical studies and to allow appropriate interpretation of clinical studies.  The effect of \nnebuliser choice in this study resulted in approximately twice the dose of drug inhaled using \nthe vibrating mesh nebuliser despite a similar nominal dose being \u2018prescribed\u2019.  Other studies \nhave shown that depending on the nebuliser chosen the amount of drug delivered to a patient \nmay vary five fold (15).   \n \nThe use of Heliox at the same inhalational flow as air would be predicted to result in less \nturbulent flow in the upper airways and if the drug aerosol in each carrier gas was the same, \ngreater lung deposition.  However, the inhalation of Heliox by patients will result in an \nincreased inhalational flow and tidal volume (2; 3) due to the lower density of the gas.  These \nstudies (2; 3), however, relate to exercise physiology and their applicability to aerosol drug \ndelivery is speculative.   This makes predictions of deposition in the upper airway more \ndifficult.  As argued by Corcoran and Gamard, the increased respiratory rate associated with \ninhalation with Heliox may reduce the settling time for these particles.  However, the larger \ntidal volumes breathed when Heliox is inhaled combined with less momentum loss in the \nupper airway is likely to deliver drug aerosols deeper into the lung (6).  In our study, we found \na significantly greater dose of drug was available for inhalation when the vibrating mesh \nnebuliser was used with Heliox compared to air.  Thus if clinical benefit was found when \nHeliox was used, this could be simply due to a greater amount of drug being inhaled.  Any \n 17 \nadditional effect due to the properties of Heliox carrying the drug into the lung would be \ndifficult to determine.  The methodology we have developed will help us to design a study to \ndetermine the effect of Heliox as a carrier gas once the drug aerosol has been inhaled.  For \nexample, using the vibrating mesh nebuliser we can alter the dose of drug so that the same \namount of drug is inhaled when either Heliox or air is used.  This will allow us to tease out \nwhether Heliox as a carrier gas improves lung deposition of drug in patients with airways \nobstruction and if this is associated with clinical benefit.   \n \nIn summary, we have developed and evaluated systems in the laboratory to allow the delivery \nof nebulised bronchodilators in undiluted Heliox.  These systems could be adapted for use \nwith patients, to allow the concentration of Heliox inhaled to be constant and not diluted by \nsurrounding room air.   Maintaining the concentration of Heliox is an essential component to \nimproving enhanced delivery of drug to the lung.  We have shown that the use of Heliox has \na significant effect on the total amount of bronchodilator likely to be inhaled and also the \namount of the drug contained in particles that are likely to reach the lower respiratory tract.  \nSuch information is required to help interpret clinical trials of drug delivery using Heliox. \n \n 18 \nREFERENCES  \n \n1.
