HOBSON and R. PETER HOBSON\nUniversity College London\nAbstract\nIn this paper we outline our hypothesis that human intersubjective engagement entails identifying with other people.\nWe tested a prediction derived from this hypothesis that concerned the relation between a component of joint\nattention and a specific form of imitation. The empirical investigation involved \u201cblind\u201d ratings of videotapes\nfrom a recent study in which we tested matched children with and without autism for their propensity to imitate the\nself-0other-orientated aspects of another person\u2019s actions. The results were in keeping with three a priori predictions,\nas follows: ~a! children with autism contrasted with control participants in spending more time looking at the\nobjects acted upon and less time looking at the tester; ~b! participants with autism showed fewer \u201csharing\u201d looks\ntoward the tester, and although they also showed fewer \u201cchecking\u201d and \u201corientating\u201d looks, they were specifically\nless likely to show any sharing looks; and, critically, ~c! within each group, individual differences in sharing looks\n~only! were associated with imitation of self\u2013other orientation. We suggest that the propensity to adopt the bodily\nanchored psychological stance of another person is essential to certain forms of joint attention and imitation, and\nthat a weak tendency to identify with others is pivotal for the developmental psychopathology of autism.\nThe discipline of developmental psychopathol-\nogy represents a uniquely powerful investiga-\ntive approach for identifying the mechanisms\nas well as the course of human psychological\ndevelopment ~Cicchetti, 1993; Sroufe & Rut-\nter, 1984!. One reason for this is that, through\nthe study of typical vis-\u00e0-vis atypical\ndevelopmental pathways, it is possible to dis-\ncern associations and dissociations among as-\npects of social and cognitive functioning that\nare otherwise difficult to disengage from one\nanother. The present paper presents an empir-\nical study of two seemingly distinct social\u2013\ncognitive propensities among children with and\nwithout autism\u2014 engaging in \u201csharing\u201d forms\nof joint attention, and imitating self-0other-\norientated aspects of other people\u2019s actions\u2014\nthat, according to our hypothesis, are under-\npinned by a common, intersubjective process.\nThis is the process of identifying with some-\none else. In identification, an observer regis-\nters and assimilates another person\u2019s bodily\nanchored psychological stance ~whether in feel-\ning or action or some other way of relating to\nthe world!, in such a way that the stance be-\ncomes a potential way of the observer relating\nto the world from his or her own position. We\nbelieve that this propensity determines uniquely\nhuman forms of sharing and intersubjective\ncommunication and role taking ~Hobson,\n200202004!.\nThis research was supported by the Economic and Social\nResearch Council ~award reference R000239355!, the\nBaily Thomas Charitable Foundation, and the Tavistock\nClinic, London ~with NHS R&D funding!.

In social inter-\nchanges grouped under the heading of \u201cjoint\nattention\u201d ~Seibert, Hogan, & Mundy, 1982!,\nthey monitor and follow the gaze of another\nperson ~responding to joint attention @RJA# !\nand point to, show, and0or alternate eye con-\ntact with reference to object and events ~ini-\ntiating joint attention @IJA# ! to direct a person\u2019s\nattention, share experiences, request things,\nor inform. Among typically developing in-\nfants, positive affect is associated more with\nsharing experiences in joint attention than with\ninstrumental gaze following or requesting\n~Kasari, Sigman, Mundy, & Yirmiya, 1990;\nMundy, Kasari, & Sigman, 1992; also Adam-\nson & Bakeman, 1985; Bruner, 1981; Rhein-\ngold, Hay, & West, 1976!. Thus, sometimes\nbut not always, joint attention serves as both\nthe means to and expression of sharing ex-\nperiences of the world with others, where\nsharing entails intersubjective contact and emo-\ntional connectedness between people ~Hob-\nson, 1989, 1993!.\nFrom very early in life, infants also show\nthe ability to imitate, for example, translating\nwhat they see in other people\u2019s faces to their\nown facial expressions ~Field, Woodson,\nGreenberg, & Cohen, 1982; Kugiamutsakis,\n1998; Meltzoff & Moore, 1997!. Beginning\naround 9 months of age, they copy simple\nnovel actions involving objects ~Meltzoff,\n1988; Meltzoff & Moore, 1998b! and may be\nobserved to reenact something of the style as\nwell as content of adult activities and copy\nself-0other-orientated actions. In waving good-\nbye, for example, or in feeding an adult with a\nspoon ~Br\u00e5ten, 1998!, the child shows role\nreversal and responds in kind to the actions\nshown toward the self by someone else ~also\nHobson, 1993; Tomasello, 1999!. One way of\ndescribing such events is to say that the child\nidentifies with the person who waves or feeds,\nso that waving goodbye to the other, or feed-\ning the other, is not only perceived but also\nassimilated into the child\u2019s own repertoire of\nactions.\nThere is only a modest research literature\non the relation between joint attention and\nimitation in early typical development, and\nresults thus far are not entirely consistent. Car-\npenter, Nagell, and Tomasello ~1998! studied\n24 infants between 9 and 15 months of age,\nand reported correlations among the ages of\nemergence of several social\u2013cognitive abili-\nties, including aspects of joint attention and\nimitation of instrumental and arbitrary goal-\ndirected actions. In contrast, in a cross-sectional\nstudy of 60 infants between 8 and 14 months,\nSlaughter and McConnell ~2003! found no re-\nlation between performance in imitating ac-\ntions on objects and gaze following or social\nreferencing. Charman et al. ~2000! reported\nthat among typically developing 20-month-\nold infants, the tendency to alternate gaze be-\ntween activated mechanical toys and an adult\nwas related to imitation of actions upon ob-\njects, once variance associated with IQ had\nbeen taken into account. A further study of a\ndifferent kind was one prompt for us to con-\nduct the present investigation. Carpenter,\nTomasello, and Savage-Rumbaugh ~1995! re-\nported a positive relation between joint atten-\ntion skills and imitative learning in young\ntypically developing children and nonhuman\nprimates. Compared with chimpanzees, chil-\ndren spent about twice as much time looking\nat the tester\u2019s face, and in each group, joint\nattention in the form of coordinated looks be-\ntween the object and partner was associated\nwith the propensity to imitate actions. In their\ndiscussion, Carpenter et al. ~1995! speculated\nthat differentiating between looks to the tester\nfor purposes of sharing experiences, as op-\nposed to looks for checking out the situation\nor orientating to her sounds or actions, may\nhave been especially important, but these forms\nof looking were not measured as the investi-\ngators opted for what they considered to be a\nmore objective behavioral coding approach.\n412 J. A. Hobson and R. P. Hobson\nThe Case of Autism\nKanner ~1943! described children with autism\nas having a basic impairment in the ability to\nengage in \u201caffective contact\u201d with others. In\nthe late 1980s, more elaborated theoretical ac-\ncounts of the development of cognitive as well\nas social features of autism emerged with a\nfocus on deficits in affective coordination and\nnonverbal communication with others as cen-\ntral to the disorder ~Hobson, 1989, 1993;\nMundy & Sigman, 1989!. Over the past two\ndecades, systematic investigations have re-\nvealed how the children show disturbances in\ntheir ability to direct expressions of affect to\nanother person, use facial expressions commu-\nnicatively, and resonate to the emotions and\nbodily expressions of others ~Bacon, Fein,\nMorris, Waterhouse, & Allen, 1998; Charman\net al., 1997; Dawson, Hill, Spencer, Galpert,\n& Watson, 1990; Hobson & Lee, 1998; Lan-\ndry & Loveland, 1988; Reddy, Williams, &\nVaughan, 2002; Sigman, Kasari, Kwon, &\nYirmiya, 1992; Wetherby & Prutting, 1984!.\nThe children\u2019s lesser tendency to look toward\nothers, not only in frequency but also in inten-\nsity of eye contact, is characteristic, and prob-\nably an early marker of the syndrome ~e.g.,\nDawson, Osterling, Meltzoff, & Kuhl, 2000;\nDiLavore, Lord, & Rutter, 1995; Volkmar &\nMayes, 1990; Wimpory, Hobson, Williams, &\nNash, 2000!. In the domain of joint attention,\nchildren with autism show a reduced tendency\nto use eye contact and deictic gestures ~e.g.,\npointing or showing! to coordinate attention\nand share experiences with social partners vis-\n\u00e0-vis objects or events in the world ~McArthur\n& Adamson, 1996; Mundy, Sigman, Ungerer,\n& Sherman, 1986!, even though they are able\nto disengage and shift attention ~Leekam,\nL\u00f3pez, & Moore, 2000!, follow a head turn\n~Leekam, Hunnisett, & Moore, 1998!, and de-\ntect what is at the focus of someone\u2019s gaze\n~Leekam, Baron-Cohen, Perrett, Milders, &\nBrown, 1997!. There is evidence that they are\nless likely to share affect in episodes of joint\nattention ~Kasari et al., 1990!, they are more\ndistinctive in their failure to point to and show\nrather than request things ~Landry & Love-\nland, 1988; Mundy et al., 1986!, and they are\nlimited in their responsiveness to others in\nsettings that would typically elicit social ref-\nerencing ~Charman et al., 1997; Sigman et al.,\n1992!. These areas of impairment appear to\ninvolve not merely lack of attentiveness or\neven affective responsiveness to other people\n~Sigman & Capps, 1997!, but also a lack of\nsharing of the kind that entails a partial move-\nment into or assimilation of the stance, the\nattitude, or the communicative intention of the\nother ~Hobson, 1993, 200202004!.\nWe stress two points that arise out of this\nbody of research. First, from a developmental\nperspective, young children with autism have\nbeen observed and0or reported to show re-\nduced one-to-one intersubjective engagement\nand responsiveness from early in life, as well\nas impairments in joint attention and other\nforms of \u201csecondary intersubjectivity\u201d ~Char-\nman et al., 1997; Wimpory et al., 2000!. In-\ndeed, such impairments in person-to-person\nengagement are also evident in adolescents\nwith autism ~Hobson & Lee, 1998!. There-\nfore, it is highly plausible, if yet to be estab-\nlished, that aspects of joint attention presuppose\nqualities of interpersonal engagement, both\nacross development and in moment-to-moment\nsocial exchanges. Second, the evidence sug-\ngests that within the domain of joint attention,\nthere is a dissociation not only between initiat-\ning and RJA, but also between forms of joint\nattention that involve sharing experiences and\nfeelings ~relatively absent in many children\nwith autism!, and those that reflect more in-\nstrumental forms of social transaction ~Kasari\net al., 1990; Mundy, 1995!. Therefore, there\nare grounds for exploring whether there is a\ncommon social\u2013developmental process impli-\ncated both in establishing emotionally config-\nured one-to-one intersubjective engagement,\nand in \u201csharing\u201d forms of joint attention, and\nperhaps also implicated in other forms of so-\ncial coordination such as imitation.\nIn this latter respect, there is substantial\nevidence that children with autism have char-\nacteristic limitations in imitating other peo-\nple, for example, when copying meaningless,\nnon-goal-directed actions and facial expres-\nsions ~DeMyer et al., 1972; Rogers, Hepburn,\nStackhouse, & Wehner, 2003!. Yet, they are\nable to copy others\u2019 goal-directed actions on\nobjects and gestures when they are motivated\nIdentification: The missing link? 413\nor encouraged to do so ~e.g., Beadle-Brown &\nWhiten, 2004; Charman & Baron-Cohen, 1994;\nHobson & Lee, 1999; Morgan, Cutrer, Coplin,\n& Rodrigue, 1989; Stone, Ousley, & Little-\nford, 1997!, even though they may have a\nreduced tendency to imitate even simple object-\nrelated actions ~Charman et al., 1997; Rogers\net al., 2003!. They also have difficulties in\npantomiming actions in the absence of an ob-\nject, or in using an object for novel purposes\n~Bartak, Rutter, & Cox, 1975; Curcio & Piser-\nchia, 1978; Hammes & Langdell, 1981; He-\nimann, Ullstadius, Dahlgren, & Gillberg, 1992;\nRogers, Bennetto, McEvoy, & Pennington,\n1996!. Moreover, just as these children\u2019s de-\nlayed echolalia and personal pronoun rever-\nsals are unusual for their anchorage of the\ncommunicative act in an original situation as\nexperienced by the child, but not shared with\n~or experienced through! other people ~e.g.,\nCharney, 1981; Hobson, 1990; Kanner, 1943!,\nseveral studies have reported an incidental ob-\nservation that children show imitative \u201crever-\nsal errors,\u201d for example, when they copy a\nmodel who displays her hands facing out-\nward, by facing their own hands inward\n~Ohta, 1987; Smith & Bryson, 1998; Whiten\n& Brown, 1998!.\nSuch failures in imitating self-0other ori-\nentation in actions have been the focus of\nthree published studies. In the first of these\n~Hobson & Lee, 1999!, individuals with au-\ntism were unusual not only in failing to copy\nthe self-0other orientation of actions, for ex-\nample, omitting to place an object against their\nshoulder when the demonstrator had placed it\nagainst his, but also in adopting the harsh or\ngentle style with which actions had been dem-\nonstrated. The authors speculated that whereas\nthe children without autism identified with\nand copied the person of the demonstrator,\nthose with autism copied the demonstrator\u2019s\ngoal-directed actions. The second study\n~Meyer & Hobson, 2004! created the basis\nfor the present investigation. We tested\nmatched children with and without autism for\ntheir propensity to imitate self\u2013other orienta-\ntion in four different actions on objects. Al-\nthough all of the children copied the actions,\nthose with autism were significantly less likely\nto imitate the self-0other orientation of the\nactions. Although half of the children in the\ncomparison group copied the self-0other ori-\nentation of the actions on at least half of the\neight trials, for example, only 3 out of the 16\nchildren with autism did so; and from a com-\nplementary perspective, 6 of the participants\nwith autism imitated self\u2013other orientation on\nfewer than two occasions, whereas only 1 par-\nticipant in the comparison group did so as\ninfrequently as this. Five of the children with\nautism, but none in the comparison group,\nshowed a predominant pattern of replicating\nthe actions as seen from their own perspec-\ntive, akin to the \u201creversal errors\u201d described\nabove. The third study ~Hobson & Meyer,\n2005! demonstrated that children with autism\nwere less likely to show or imitate self-\nreferential behavior when communicating to\nsomeone else where on her body to place a\nsticker-badge.\nFinally, what of the evidence for a positive\nrelation between joint attention and imitation\namong individuals with autism? Again the ev-\nidence is relatively sparse. In a study of 24\nchildren with autism of mean age 34 months,\nRogers et al. ~2003! reported that affected\nchildren\u2019s performance on tests of imitation\n~three manual acts, three actions on objects,\nand three oral\u2013facial movements! were cor-\nrelated with the frequency of IJA for the\npurpose of commenting, even when taking\ndevelopmental level into account, and also cor-\nrelated with social responsivity but not after\nvariance associated with developmental level\nwas considered. Carpenter, Pennington, and\nRogers ~2002! also reported a positive rela-\ntion between the presence of \u201cjoint engage-\nment\u201d ~referential looking, i.e., looking from\nan object to the adult\u2019s face and back to the\nsame object! and imitative learning of goal-\ndirected instrumental or arbitrary actions\namong children with autism, although they\nalso noted that their measure of joint engage-\nment ~i.e., requiring only one triadic look dur-\ning a session of 45 min! was not a sensitive\none ~see also Ingersoll, Schreibman, & Tran,\n2003; Roeyers, Van Oost, & Bothuyne, 1998!.\nSuch evidence is highly suggestive, but lack-\ning in specificity concerning the links be-\ntween different aspects of joint attention and\nimitation.\n414 J. A. Hobson and R. P. Hobson\nHypothesis and Predictions\nThe hypothesis that underpins the present study\nis that from early in life, there is a common\nfactor implicated in the human abilities ~a! to\nestablish emotionally configured one-to-one\nintersubjective engagement, ~b! to engage in\n\u201csharing\u201d forms of joint attention, and ~c! to\nachieve forms of imitation in which personal\nstances or roles are reversed. This common\nfactor is a biologically grounded process, that\nof identifying with someone else. A second\nhypothesis is that children with autism have\nless of a propensity and0or ability to identify\nwith another person, and that this is a source\nof abnormality in interpersonal relatedness,\njoint attention, and imitation.\nOur hypothesis pivots on the notion of\n\u201cidentifying with\u201d someone else. One helpful\ndefinition of identification is that provided\nby Laplanche and Pontalis ~1973!: \u201cPsycho-\nlogical process whereby the subject assimi-\nlates an aspect, property, or attribute of the\nother and is transformed, wholly or partially,\nafter the model the other provides.\u201d For the\npresent purposes, it is appropriate to narrow\nthe definition as it applies to the setting of\nan experimental task: to identify with some-\none else is to relate to the actions and atti-\ntudes of someone else from the other\u2019s\nperspective or stance, in such a way that a\nperson assimilates the other\u2019s orientation to-\nward the world, including toward the self, so\nthat this orientation becomes a feature of the\nperson\u2019s own psychological repertoire ~Hob-\nson, 1993, 200202004; Hobson & Lee, 1999;\nHobson & Meyer, 2005!. When, through iden-\ntification, an individual shares experiences of\nthe world with someone else in joint atten-\ntion, he or she both resonates to the attitudes\nof the other from the others\u2019 bodily anchored\nstance and maintains enough of his or her\nown starting state to make the sharing \u201cshar-\ning\u201d ~and not mere adjustment!. Moreover,\nwhen the propensity to identify with some-\none else motivates imitation, typically this\nprompts the individual to adopt the other\nperson\u2019s stance in behaving and relating to\nthe world, rather than copying the person\u2019s\nactions per se. For this reason the individual\ntends to copy the style and self-0other orien-\ntation of the other\u2019s actions, a process that\npromotes role reversals in action and attitude.\nAlthough we made three predictions, the\nfirst two of these might have been anticipated\non the basis of previous research and0or alter-\nnative theoretical perspectives ~e.g., Swetten-\nham et al., 1998; Mundy & Neal, 2001!, and it\nwas the third that was more specifically de-\nrived from our hypothesis. The first predic-\ntion concerned the motivation and propensity\nto engage with other people: we predicted that\nrelative to matched children without autism,\nchildren with autism would be rated as spend-\ning more time looking at the objects, and less\ntime looking at the tester, in the course of a\ntest of imitation. In the second, we predicted\nthat children with autism would be less likely\nto engage in \u201csharing\u201d looks, and this would\nbe a specific deficit in relation to relatively\nspared \u201cchecking\u201d or \u201corientating\u201d looks. This\nprediction, although in keeping with previous\nfindings, entailed a novel focus upon that qual-\nity of looks that human judges can recognize\nas reflecting intersubjective personal0affective\ncontact. Our third and critical prediction con-\ncerned individual differences within as well\nas across groups, namely that participants who\nshowed sharing looks would be those who\nimitated self-0other orientation. This predic-\ntion derived from our hypothesis that sharing\nlooks ~but not checking or orientating looks!\nentail the same quality of interpersonal engage-\nment, namely, engagement that involves iden-\ntification, that structures and motivates self-0\nother-orientated imitation.\nHere we emphasize that the present study\ncannot yield decisive evidence that our own\nhypothesis is either more or less valid than\nseveral other theoretical approaches in the lit-\nerature. Yet having said this, the prediction\nabout the relation between sharing looks and\nself-0other-orientated aspects of imitation was\nderived directly from the identification hypoth-\nesis, and it is not obvious that it would have\nbeen generated or indeed espoused by those\nof any other theoretical persuasion. In addi-\ntion, because the hypothesis concerned the re-\nlation between sharing experiences ~Hobson,\n1989! and imitation of self-0other orientation,\nit was appropriate to seek for measures to\nassess behavioral expressions of sharing, and\nIdentification: The missing link? 415\nbecause sharing per se is something that can\nonly be judged by a person, we sought to es-\ntablish whether different kinds of look de-\nscribed in the literature as joint attention,\nalternating, or referential looks could be rated\nreliably according to this further criterion. We\ndo not presuppose that such ratings are or are\nnot reducible to some combination of behav-\nioral ratings. If such ratings were to be inter-\npreted as indices of \u201csharing,\u201d still there would\nneed to be evidence that they corresponded\nwith judgments of sharing per se ~otherwise,\nthere would be no justification for supposing\nthe measures were of sharing!. Although our\napproach seemed most appropriate for testing\nour predictions, we also conduct a prelimi-\nnary exploration of this issue.\nMethod\nParticipants\nWe tested two groups of children ~n\u0001 16 per\ngroup!, one with and one without autism but\nwith learning disabilities, mild to moderate\nmental retardation, and0or developmental de-\nlays, who were between the ages of 6 and 14\nyears. Children were tested in their schools,\nand selected on the basis of parental consent\nto participate. All participants with autism dis-\nplayed the patterns of impairment in social\ninteraction and communication, coupled with\nrepetitive or stereotyped interests and activi-\nties, characteristic of the disorder. We con-\nfirmed the clinical diagnosis by completing a\nDSM-IV criteria checklist ~American Psychi-\natric Association, 1994! on the basis of sys-\ntematic interviews with teachers, and by having\na psychologist with over 10 years\u2019 experience\nof using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale\n~CARS; Schopler, Reichler, & Renner, 1988!\nrate classroom observations of the children\naccording to this measure. The CARS covers\nsuch domains as social relatedness, verbal and\nnonverbal communication, repetitive behav-\niour, sensory abnormalities, emotion regula-\ntion, and cognitive abilities. On the CARS,\nwhere a score of 30 or above is taken to indi-\ncate autism, the ratings of the children with\nautism were M\u0001 38.2, SD\u0001 6.4, range\u0001 31.5\nto 54.5.\nThe children with and without autism were\ngroup-matched for chronological age and\nlanguage performance on the British Picture\nVocabulary Scales ~BPVS; Dunn, Dunn, &\nWhetton, 1982!, the British version of the Pea-\nbody Picture Vocabulary Scale. The BPVS is\na standardized, widely used measure of recep-\ntive vocabulary, assessing a cognitive ability\nthat is relatively more impaired in persons\nwith autism ~Jarrold, Boucher, & Russell, 1977;\nLockyer & Rutter, 1970!. Participant charac-\nteristics appear in Table 1.\nVerbal intelligence ~from the BPVS! was\nvery similar in the two groups: for children\nwith autism, M \u0001 54.2, SD \u0001 21.2, range \u0001\n28\u2013107; and for the learning-disabled ~LD!\ncomparison group, M \u0001 53.5, SD \u0001 23.0,\nrange\u0001 23\u2013100. To assess participants\u2019 fine-\nmotor abilities and visual\u2013motor integration\nskill, children were tested with the Beery De-\nvelopmental Test of Visual\u2013Motor Integration\n~VMI; Beery, 1997!. The VMI presents a se-\nquence of geometric forms that the child is\nasked to copy with paper and a pencil.

There were four\nactions, each of which involved a different set\nof materials. Each of the four actions was pre-\nsented in two different ways. For example, the\nexperimenter picked up a small wheel with a\nmetal handle ~a castor from furniture! that had\nbeen placed in the middle of the testing mat,\nand proceeded to roll it from one side of the\nmat to the other, either across the mat directly\nin front of herself, as illustrated in Figure 1\n~i.e., from left to right, neither away from nor\ntoward herself ! or, leaning forward, across\nthe mat immediately in front of the partici-\npant. The remaining three conditions involved\nstrumming a wooden stick along the serrated\nback of a wooden frog, stacking boxes, and\ntapping beanbags ~in each case, either toward\nor away from the tester!. For each of the four\nconditions, children saw the investigator pro-\nduce the action in one of two possible orien-\ntations ~close to or toward herself, or close to\nor toward the child! on the first testing ses-\nsion, and saw the alternative orientation for\neach condition in a second session on another\nday. After demonstrating each action, the tester\nreturned the object~s! to their original posi-\ntions and instructed the child: \u201cNow you.\u201d\nThere was no explicit instruction to copy what\nshe had done. Details of our scoring proce-\ndure are provided in the original publication\n~Meyer & Hobson, 2004!. In brief, imitation\nof self-0other orientation was defined as the\nchild adopting the examiner\u2019s demonstrated\nself-0other-anchored orientation, and there-\nfore reversing the positioning of the object\nand directedness of the action. The children\u2019s\nscores ~on which there was a significant group\ndifference! are incorporated in the present\nstudy. Geometric repetition, a subclassifica-\ntion of nonself-0other-orientated imitative re-\nsponses, was scored when the child\u2019s imitative\nresponse involved a reenactment of the dem-\nFigure 1.

There were only five children in\nthe study, each of whom had autism, who used\nthis as a primary response strategy, and these\nindividuals are also reconsidered in relation to\nthe present findings.\nCurrent study: Joint attention and imitation\nCoding and reliability. Figure 1 portrays the\ncamera view and testing arrangements from\nour self-0other orientation study. The tester\nand child were seated directly across from one\nother on a testing mat. The camera angle al-\nways captured the child\u2019s entire face, the ob-\nject, and the back of the tester\u2019s head and face\nso that the child\u2019s actions, gaze patterns, and\nfacial expressions in relation to the tester could\nbe coded. In Figure 1, for example, the tester\nis demonstrating rolling a wheel in relation to\nself, and the child is looking at the object. At\nthe time of the original study, the tester was\nunaware that the videotapes would be coded\nfor joint attention.\nVideotapes were rated in a standardized\nfashion. To structure the rating episodes, these\ncomprised both the model period, which com-\nmenced when the tester stated \u201cwatch this\u201d\nand proceeded to demonstrate the action, and\nthe response period, defined as commencing\nwhen the tester stated \u201cnow you\u201d as she handed\nthe materials to the child. The rating episode\nended when the tester provided feedback ~e.g.,\n\u201cwell done\u201d! to the child regarding his or her\nperformance and proceeded to remove the toy\nto begin the next task. This structure was im-\nposed to ensure that only discrete, standard\nintervals of triadic engagement around each\nparticular toy were rated. As a preliminary\nstep, we determined that self-0other orienta-\ntion ~either toward or away from the self, or\nwithout orientation! could be rated reliably by\nindependent judges, in that there was agree-\nment on 23 out of 24 actions ~and in the re-\nmaining case a child had rolled the wheel\ndirectly along the line that served to distin-\nguish two of the categories!.\nAs a first step, an independent naive judge\ncoded the children\u2019s direction of gaze on a\nsecond by second basis using these rating epi-\nsodes. Gaze was rated as being directed either\ntoward the tester\u2019s eyes0face, toward the ob-\nject, or away. On the basis of eight partici-\npants ~n \u0001 4 per group!, the primary naive\njudge and a second independent rater demon-\nstrated excellent interrater reliability in record-\ning the numbers of seconds spent directing\ngaze to the tester ~intraclass correlation @ICC#\u0001\n.75!, to the object ~ICC\u0001 .94!, or away ~ICC\u0001\n.95!.\nThe next stage involved the same primary\nnaive judge revisiting each look to the tester,\nand providing a second rating with respect to\nthe quality and0or function of the look accord-\ning to the following mutually exclusive and\nexhaustive scheme. \u201cOrientating looks\u201d were\nthose that appeared to occur in direct response\nto an action, sound, or movement on the part\nof the tester. \u201cSharing looks\u201d were defined as\nthose looks directed to the tester that could be\nseen to express a participant sharing experi-\nence through interpersonal contact with the\ntester. They involved a deep gaze that con-\nveyed personal involvement ~what Kanner,\n1943, probably meant by the phrase \u201caffective\ncontact\u201d!, in contrast to checking looks that\ninvolved glances \u201cat\u201d the tester. \u201cChecking\nlooks\u201d were defined as those looks toward the\ntester that were used to assess or check out\neither the situation or the tester\u2019s response.\nMore detailed distinguishing characteristics be-\ntween sharing and checking looks are pre-\nsented in Table 2. We had established through\npilot testing that although this approach to\nrating was subjective, in most instances the\nratings of intersubjective qualities of engage-\nment could be accomplished with confidence.\nThe second judge also revisited each of the\njoint attention looks ~n\u0001 27! for six randomly\nselected participants ~n \u0001 3 per group! and\n~blind to the first judge\u2019s ratings and all other\naspects of the study! rated each as being either\nsharing, checking, or orientating in quality.\nThe two independent judges agreed on 24\n~89%! of the 27 looks ~k \u0001 .83, excellent\nagreement according to Landis & Koch, 1977!.\nThere were 6 looks that both judges agreed\nwere \u201corientating,\u201d 8 looks that both agreed\nwere \u201cchecking,\u201d and 10 looks which both\nagreed were \u201csharing.\u201d The three remaining\nlooks were all judged to be \u201csharing\u201d looks by\n418 J. A. Hobson and R. P. Hobson\none rater and \u201cchecking\u201d looks by the other.\nAn alternative approach is to consider esti-\nmates of reliability of sharing versus all other\nkinds of look ~k\u0001 .78!, checking versus other\nkinds of look ~k\u0001 .76!, and orientating versus\nother kinds of look ~k\u0001 1.0!. These levels of\nagreement may appear unusually high, but\nmostly it was straightforward to \u201cfeel\u201d ~and\njudge! whether the looks seen on videotape\nwere sharing, expressive of interpersonal en-\ngagement; checking, indicative of glancing up\nto check the tester\u2019s face for a reaction or\ninstruction; or orientating where the tester made\na clear movement or sound that attracted the\nchild\u2019s attention.\nWe explored a further approach to rating\nthe looks. In our view, the definitions we were\nusing were specific and appropriate to what\nwe were studying and also effective ~opera-\ntionally! insofar as they yielded satisfactory\ninterrater reliabilities in the judgments of qual-\nities of looking. However, we felt it would\naugment the study if we provided further de-\nscription of complementary behavioral indi-\nces corresponding to the different categories\nof alternating looks. Therefore, we returned to\nour original ratings, and determined the dura-\ntion of every look, where, perhaps, sharing\nlooks might be expected to be longer than\nother kinds of look. It turned out that for both\ngroups of participants, over 90% of each kind\nof look lasted for 1 s or less, and those looks\nthat lasted between 2 and 3 s were distributed\nacross the categories of look. The one look\nlasting 4 s was a sharing look by a child with\nautism. Second, we asked a new rater who\nwas unaware of the nature of the study and the\nclasses of look, to watch each look and record\nwhether it was accompanied by a smile, where\nagain, it might have been supposed that smil-\ning would characterize sharing looks. Among\nchildren with autism, 8 ~67%! of the 12 shar-\ning looks were accompanied by smiles, as were\n10 ~29%! of the 35 checking looks and 3 ~21%!\nof the 14 orientating looks. Among children in\nthe comparison group, 18 ~51%! of the 35\nsharing looks were accompanied by smiles, as\nwere 32 ~42%! of the 77 checking looks and\n15 ~31%! out of the 49 orientating looks. These\nresults indicate that many sharing looks were\nneither long nor accompanied by smiles and\nthat frequently smiles accompanied other kinds\nof look.\nSummary scores. The total testing ~and there-\nfore rating! time was about 1.5 min in length,\nbut there were minor differences in total dura-\ntion between the groups ~for the children with\nautism: M\u0001 80 s, SD\u0001 6 s, range\u0001 71\u201394 s;\nand for the children in the comparison group:\nM \u0001 95 s, SD \u0001 19 s, range \u0001 52\u2013124 s!. In\naddition, although the entire duration of the\nrating episodes ~100%! were easily coded for\nmost of the children ~11 of the 16 children in\nthe comparison group and 14 of the 16 chil-\ndren with autism!, for the remaining 7 chil-\ndren, there were brief moments when the\nchild\u2019s face was out of view of the camera or\nthe tester\u2019s head blocked view of the child\u2019s\ngaze. For these reasons, results were consid-\nered on the basis of percentage of total rate-\nable time ~for directedness, a durational code!\nand rate of looks per rateable minute ~for shar-\ning, checking, and orientating looks, a fre-\nTable 2.

The six variables of interest\nwere thus percentage of time spent looking at\nthe tester, the object, or away and the rate of\nlooks per minute to the tester that were \u201cshar-\ning,\u201d \u201cchecking,\u201d or \u201corientating\u201d in quality.\nResults\nFor our principal a priori predictions, the data\nare analyzed using one-tailed tests.\nDirectedness of gaze\nThe descriptive data for directedness of gaze\nappear in Table 3. The first point to note is\nhow closely similar the groups were in how\nrarely they looked away from the tester and\nmaterials, on average about 1% of the time.\nNext, it may be observed that although both\ngroups of children spent most of their time\nlooking at the objects, the children with au-\ntism did so for a higher percentage ~over 90%!\nof the period, t ~30! \u0001 2.49, p , .05, two\ntailed, with a medium effect size ~d \u0001 .7;\nCohen, 1992!. Finally, there is a striking group\ndifference in the deployment of gaze toward\nthe tester: The children with autism looked at\nthe tester for less than half as much time as\nchildren in the comparison group ~Ms\u0001 5 and\n12%, respectively!, t ~30! \u0001 \u00022.92, p , .01,\none tailed, again with a large effect size ~d\u0001\n.82!.\nQuality of joint attention looks\nNext we consider the number of each kind of\njoint attention look ~sharing, checking, and\norientating! to the tester. Table 4 conveys how,\nas a group, children with autism showed fewer\nof each kind of look. As we predicted, there\nwas a group difference for sharing looks\nt ~30! \u0001 \u00021.78, p , .05, one tailed, d \u0001 .43.\nWhen we consider checking looks, t ~30! \u0001\n\u00022.19, p , .05, two tailed, d \u0001 .57, and ori-\nentating looks, t ~30! \u0001 \u00023.37, p , .05, two\ntailed, d \u0001 .88, a similar pattern is evident.\nIndeed, at this level of analysis, the largest\neffect size ~and difference between the groups!\nappears to be with respect to orientating looks,\nfollowed by checking looks, and then sharing\nlooks.\nHowever, when we consider quality of joint\nattention by individual participants, a differ-\nent pattern emerges. As can be seen in Fig-\nure 2, 11 of the 16 children with autism\ncompared with only 5 of the comparison chil-\ndren failed to engage in a single sharing look\n~Fisher exact p \u0001 .038, one tailed!. This was\nnot the case for other kinds of look. All but\nfour of the children with autism ~and one of\nthe comparison children! showed at least one\nchecking look and all but 5 of the children\nwith autism and 2 of the comparison children\nshowed at least one orientating look. Nonpara-\nmetric repeated-measures comparisons con-\nfirmed that among participants with autism,\nthe numbers of children engaging in at least\none sharing, checking, and orientating look\nwere not the same ~Cochran Q \u0001 7.82, p \u0001\n.02!. Follow-up Wilcoxon Sign Tests revealed\nthat, within the group of children with autism,\nfewer participants engaged in sharing than\nchecking looks ~z \u0001 \u00022.65, p , .01! and in\nsharing than orientating looks ~z \u0001 \u00022.12,\np, .05! whereas checking looks and orientat-\ning looks occurred for similar numbers of chil-\ndren ~z\u0001\u0002.38, p\u0001 .71!.

Hobson\nbutions were not significantly different for\nnumbers of children showing each kind of look\nat least once ~Cochran Q\u0001 4.33, p\u0001 .12, ns!.\nTherefore, although we had not made a spe-\ncific prediction about whether a limited ten-\ndency to engage in sharing looks would be\nbecause of group differences in frequency of\nlooks or number of individual children who\nfailed to show any such looks, the two mea-\nsures yield complementary indices of the\nchildren\u2019s propensity for intersubjective en-\ngagement. Whereas children with autism en-\ngaged in less joint attention overall, relative to\nchildren in the comparison group, there were\nalso a high number of children with autism\nwho failed to engage in sharing looks at all, a\nfinding specific both to type of look and to\ndiagnostic group.\nSharing looks and imitation\nof self-0other orientation\nOur third prediction concerned the relation-\nship between a specific quality of joint atten-\ntion, involving sharing looks, and a specific\naspect of imitation, the propensity to imitate\nthe self-0other-orientated aspects of the tester\u2019s\nactions. The children\u2019s performance on self-0\nother orientation was evaluated in our previ-\nous investigation ~Meyer & Hobson, 2004!\nand we present histograms of those results\nand map on data from the present study in\nFigures 3 and 4. As we had predicted, children\nwho had a propensity to engage in sharing\nlooks were more likely to imitate self-0other\norientation across the entire sample, Spear-\nman r ~32! \u0001 .54, p , .001, one tailed. As\nillustrated in Figures 3 and 4, this was the case\nseparately for the children with autism, Spear-\nman r ~16!\u0001 .49, p , .05, one tailed, and for\nthose in the comparison group, Spearman r\n~16! \u0001 .47, p , .05, one tailed. By contrast,\nthe rate per minute of other kinds of looking\nwas not related to the children\u2019s scores on\nimitation of self\u2013other orientation: for check-\ning looks, Spearman r ~32! \u0001 .28, and for\norientating looks, Spearman r ~32! \u0001 .01.\nTherefore, the positive result was specific to\nthose looks which involved sharing.\nAcross the entire sample, there was a sig-\nnificant correlation between rates of checking\nand rates of sharing looks, Spearman r ~32!\u0001\n.62.

In contrast, there were five children in\nthis group who showed some adjustment to\nself\u2013other orientation without sharing looks,\nwhich raises the question of whether there\nmight be other routes to this form of response\n~e.g., understanding the action as toward\nor away from an agent\u2019s body, or identifying\nwith someone without this being reflected in\nlooking!.\nBoth self\u2013other imitation and sharing looks\nwere more frequent in the comparison chil-\ndren, yet Figure 4 illustrates how a similar\npattern of the relation between self\u2013other im-\nitation and sharing looks is present. Of the\nseven comparison children who imitated self\u2013\nother orientation on four or more occasions,\nsix of these engaged in sharing looks, and four\nof these children did so at a rate of over two\nper minute. The one child in the comparison\ngroup who imitated self-0other orientation on\nfewer than two occasions failed to engage in\nany sharing looks.\nDevelopmental considerations\nChronological age and profiles of looking.\nAcross the sample of children, as well as within\neach group, those who were younger tended\nto look toward the tester more. Overall, there\nwas an inverse relationship between chrono-\nlogical age and joint attention for sharing looks,\nSpearman r ~32! \u0001 \u0002.51, p , .01, checking\nlooks, Spearman r ~32!\u0001\u0002.36, p , .05, and\norientating looks, Spearman r ~32! \u0001 \u0002.46,\np , .01. In this regard, the tester had noted\nhow some of the older children and adoles-\ncents tended to show more ~perhaps norma-\ntive! social inhibition, and look to her less\nduring interactions.\nHowever, the pattern appeared to be differ-\nent in each group. For children with autism,\nonly sharing looks decreased significantly with\nage, Spearman r ~16!\u0001\u0002.61, p, .05 ~check-\ning r \u0001 \u0002.25, orientating r \u0001 \u0002.08!. The\ninverse correlation between chronological age\nand sharing looks was significantly stronger\nthan that between chronological age and check-\ning looks or orienting looks ~t \u0001 1.77 and\n1.80, p , .05, one tailed, respectively!. By\nway of illustration, four out of the five chil-\ndren with autism who ever showed a sharing\nlook were under 10 years, and only one of the\n10 children over this age ever showed such a\nlook.\nThe picture was different for the children\nwithout autism. Within this group, only check-\ning and orientating looks decreased signifi-\ncantly with age, Spearman r ~16! \u0001 \u0002.50,\np, .05, and r ~16!\u0001\u0002.78, p, .001, respec-\ntively ~sharing r \u0001 \u0002.38!. Here, the inverse\ncorrelation between chronological age and\nsharing looks was significantly weaker than\nthat for orientating looks ~t\u0001 1.96, p , .05!,\nbut not for checking looks. Despite this, the\ninverse correlation between chronological age\nand sharing looks was not significantly differ-\nent between the groups ~z\u0001\u0002.78, ns!.\nOverall, therefore, there was suggestive ev-\nidence that the inverse relation between age\nand sharing looks vis-\u00e0-vis other kinds of look\nwas specific to the participants with autism.\nChronological age and self-0other-orientated\nimitation. Across the sample, chronological\nage was not correlated with self-0other-\norientated imitation, r ~32!\u0001 .02. Once again,\nhowever, the associations between chronolog-\nical age and self-0other-orientated imitation\nwere different within the participants of each\ngroup. In the case of children without autism,\nit appeared that the older children were non-\nsignificantly more likely to adopt self-0other-\norientated imitation ~r \u0001 .45!, whereas the\nnonsignificant association was in the opposite\ndirection for participants with autism ~r \u0001\n\u0002.25!, and the difference between these cor-\nrelations was significant ~z \u0001 1.89, p , .05!.\nThese results present something of a para-\ndox. Why should children with autism not be\nshowing the expected age-related improve-\nments on the imitation task? Perhaps sharing\nlooks hold the key.\nChronological age and sharing looks revisited.\nWhen we considered the variance associated\nwith chronological age, the relation between\nsharing looks and imitation of self-0other ori-\nentation remained both across the groups, and\nfor the children with autism: partial r ~32! \u0001\n.64, partial r ~16! \u0001 .44 ~Cohen & Cohen,\n1983!. It is more striking that, when the vari-\nance associated with sharing looks was con-\nIdentification: The missing link? 423\nsidered for the children with autism, the relation\nbetween chronological age and imitation of\nself-0other orientation changed from r\u0001\u0002.25\nto partial r\u0001 .07. This result provides supple-\nmentary evidence that the association be-\ntween sharing looks and self-0other-orientated\nimitation is critical for children with autism.\nDevelopmental abilities. Only one out of six\ncorrelations between each kind of look and\nverbal MA and verbal IQ was significant when\nconsidered in isolation ~and therefore this was\nof uncertain status!: verbal MA was nega-\ntively correlated with orientating looks at a\nlevel of \u0002.43. In addition, VMI ability was\nnot significantly associated with sharing looks,\neither within or across the groups.\nFurther observations\nThe group of 5 ~out of the 16! children with\nautism who engaged in sharing looks spent a\nrelatively high proportion of time looking at\nthe tester ~M \u0001 11%, SD \u0001 4.99!, although\nthere were individual differences in this re-\ngard ~range \u0001 3.4\u201315.4%!. They showed a\nbroad range of cognitive ability ~IQ range \u0001\n43\u2013107! and chronological age ~range \u0001 5\nyears, 11 months to 12 years, 11 months!.\nFrom a complementary perspective, the five\nchildren in the comparison group who did not\nengage in any sharing looks were all far be-\nlow their group mean in the percent of time\nthey spent looking at the tester ~range\u0001 1.2\u2013\n9.2%!, and were also in the lower range of\ncognitive ability ~IQ range\u0001 30\u201371!.\nIn our original study, there were five chil-\ndren with autism who were unusual in that\nthey used \u201cgeometric repetition\u201d as their pri-\nmary response mode of imitating. For the ma-\njority of their imitative responses, these\nchildren copied the orientation of the object as\nthey had observed it relative to themselves,\nexactly as had happened in the demonstration.\nThis group of children were relatively low in\nthe time they spent looking at the tester ~be-\ntween 2 and 7% of the time! vis-\u00e0-vis the\nobject ~range \u0001 92\u201398%!. Only one of the\nfive children ever engaged in a sharing look,\nalthough all five showed checking looks and\nthree showed orientating looks. Of the three\nchildren with autism who imitated self-0other\norientation as a principal response mode, two\nwere unusual in looking at the tester 13 and\n14% of the time, which was above the mean\nof the children in the comparison group. The\nthird child was also unusual in that he never\nlooked in the tester\u2019s eyes during the imitation\ntasks, and during classroom interactions, ap-\npeared to avoid eye contact as if he might find\nit overwhelming.\nDiscussion\nIn the introduction to this paper, we drew at-\ntention to evidence that renders it plausible\nthat the process of identification is operative\nin certain forms of interpersonal engagement,\njoint attention, and imitation that characterize\ntypically developing infants, and that this pro-\ncess is specifically impaired in children with\nautism. Our reasoning was that if, as had al-\nready been demonstrated, individuals with au-\ntism were less prone to copy the self-0other\norientation of someone else\u2019s actions, then this\nprobably reflected failures in identification that\nwould also be manifest in other indices of\ninterpersonal engagement.\nOur first prediction was inspired by the\nwork of Carpenter et al. ~1995!, who demon-\nstrated a relation between joint attention and\nimitation in typically developing children and\nchimpanzees. Like these authors, we consid-\nered that an individual who copies a person\u2019s\nway of behaving is more likely to have en-\ngaged with that person in joint attention,\nwhereas one who does not might be preoccu-\npied with the object acted upon. Therefore,\nwe predicted that when compared with con-\ntrol participants on our imitation task, those\nwith autism would spend relatively more time\nfocused upon the object than the demonstra-\ntor. As in the Carpenter et al. ~1995! study,\nand in keeping with other evidence in the lit-\nerature ~Kasari et al., 1990!, participants in\nboth groups spent the majority of time look-\ning at the objects. However, these results also\nprovided further evidence consistent with other\nliterature ~Swettenham et al., 1998! that chil-\ndren with autism spend relatively less time\nlooking at people.\n424 J. A. Hobson and R. P. Hobson\nOur second prediction was more specific.\nHere we were concerned to evaluate the qual-\nity of the joint attention shown by partici-\npants. Bearing much in common with the work\nof Adamson and Bakeman ~1985!, Bruner\n~1981!, Hornick and Gunnar ~1988!, Kasari\net al. ~1990!, and Mundy et al. ~1992!, we also\nconsidered that much of joint attention may\nexpress sharing of affective experience. We\nwanted to explore whether one can make mean-\ningful distinctions among different forms of\njoint attention, which may involve varying de-\ngrees of sharing of experience and ~according\nto our hypothesis! identification with another\nperson. There was high reliability in the rat-\nings of sharing looks, and these looks proved\nto be less prevalent among participants with\nautism, but this was also the case for checking\nand orienting looks. Therefore, all forms of\njoint attention were less frequently observed\namong participants with autism. In contrast,\ntwo-thirds of participants with autism never\nshowed a \u201csharing\u201d look, whereas this was the\ncase for one-third of the comparison group.\nIndividual profiles of looking revealed how\nonly among participants with autism were there\nsignificantly fewer individuals who showed\nany sharing look, than who showed any check-\ning and0or orienting look. Of interest, all but\none of the five children with autism who\nshowed a sharing look were under 10 years\nold, suggesting that interpersonal engagement\nmay have a complex developmental course.\nHowever, because sharing looks tended to be\nless frequent than other kinds of look for both\ngroups of participants, and the children with\nautism tended to show fewer looks of all kinds,\none should not overestimate the specificity of\nthe dearth of sharing looks.\nOur third and critical prediction was that\nsharing looks, and only sharing looks, would\nrelate to imitation of self-0other orientation.\nThe results indicated that, indeed, participants\nin each group who showed sharing looks tended\nto be those who imitated the demonstrator\u2019s\nself-0other orientation, whereas all those with\nthe lowest scores of self-0other orientation also\nshowed a complete absence of sharing looks.\nHere it should be recalled that our previous\nstudy had shown how as a group, children\nwith autism were limited in their propensity to\ntranspose a demonstrator\u2019s actions in relation\nto herself into actions in relation to them-\nselves. Despite these differences in overall lev-\nels of performance, there remained sufficient\nwithin-group variance to establish that within\neach group, individual differences in sharing\nlooks corresponded with individual differ-\nences in imitating self-0other orientation in\nactions. More detailed analyses of individual\nresponse patterns elaborated this picture, for\ninstance in revealing that only one of the five\nchildren with autism who showed a predomi-\nnance of geometric ~i.e., exact! repetition in\nthe imitation task ever engaged in a sharing\nlook, and all tended to be object-focused in\nlooking.\nSeveral aspects of the results deserve spe-\ncial consideration. First, they were derived\nfrom groups of relatively modest size, and\nreplication is needed. Sample sizes this small\ndo not allow for a reliable estimate of the true\nlevel of association among variables because\nthe confidence limits around correlations, and\ndifferences between correlations, are large.\nSecond, all the children were \u201con task\u201d nearly\nall the time, in that looks away from the object\nacted upon and0or the person of the demon-\nstrator were few in number and brief in dura-\ntion. Therefore, the group difference in overall\nlooks to the tester was not simply the result of\nglobal inattentiveness among participants with\nautism; rather, it represented a different de-\nployment of attention ~perhaps more accu-\nrately, a different pattern of psychological\nengagement with person and object! by par-\nticipants in the two groups. It is important to\nnote that not only looks to share, but also\nlooks to check and looks to orientate in rela-\ntion to the demonstrator, were less frequent\namong participants with autism. Whatever mo-\ntivates a participant to look to someone else in\na testing situation such as this, therefore, and\nwhatever the draw to giving some form of\nattention to the other person, something that\nextends beyond a wish to share experiences,\nthis distinguishes individuals with and with-\nout autism. Perhaps it would be more accurate\nto state that the groups differed in the relative\n\u201cpull\u201d toward objects and people, in that it is\npossible that participants with autism became\n~relatively, albeit not markedly! fixed in look-\nIdentification: The missing link? 425\ning at the objects. Therefore, at this level of\ndescription, one might consider the group dif-\nference to reflect a distinction in terms of so-\ncial orientation ~Dawson, Meltzoff, Osterling,\nRinaldi, & Brown, 1998; Mundy & Neal,\n2001!.\nThird, it is not clear whether the results\nreflect something enduring about individual\ndifferences among participants, something\nabout the connection between their pattern of\nengagement in this particular setting and their\nimitative performance, or some mixture of the\ntwo. For instance, one can imagine that on a\ngiven day an individual of either group might\nfeel less than usually inclined to become in-\nvolved with the tester, and for this reason de-\nploy his or her attention to the objects of the\ntask and as a result fail to imitate self-0other\norientation. Such a person might behave dif-\nferently on another occasion, even though the\nrelation between sharing looks and imitation\nmight still hold. Although such a possibility\ndoes not undermine the observed group differ-\nences, it does serve to highlight how the ex-\nperimental procedure provides a very brief\nsnapshot of a particular set of goings on.\nFourth and finally, it is important to note\nthat although the results indicated that specif-\nically sharing looks ~and not other kinds of\nlook! were related to imitating self-0other ori-\nentation, we did not examine whether sharing\nlooks were related to other aspects of imita-\ntion. Earlier we cited evidence that among\nchildren with autism, joint attention may be\nrelated to the children\u2019s ability to imitate other\nkinds of action. Therefore, it remains to estab-\nlish how far the present results reflect a \u201cspe-\ncial case\u201d of the relation between a specific\nform of joint attention and a specific form of\nimitation, or how far this relation might apply\nmore broadly. Indeed, it is possible ~and we\nbelieve, likely! that the processes that nor-\nmally promote sharing forms of joint attention\nand role-sensitive adjustments in imitative be-\nhavior also operate to motivate attentiveness\nto and imitation of other people in more gen-\neral respects.\nThese considerations bear upon the choice\nof which among several approaches might be\nmost appropriate in interpreting the results.\nFor example, one might focus on domain-\ngeneral abilities such as participants\u2019 atten-\ntion regulation skills ~e.g., Hughes & Russell,\n1993; Landry & Bryson, 2004!, and consider\nhow those individuals who fail to sustain or\ndistribute their attention in a typical way might\nshow few sharing looks and at the same time,\nfail to notice or copy all aspects of demon-\nstrated actions. From the perspective of social\u2013\ncognitive mental representation ~e.g., Frith,\nMorton, & Leslie, 1991!, in contrast, one might\nconsider that individuals who fail to \u201cdecou-\nple\u201d their own and others\u2019 representations of\nthe world would not only show limited joint\nattention vis-\u00e0-vis the world, but also a lack of\nsensitivity to ~and imitation of ! the kinds of\nperson-anchored stance tested here. Even if\none adopts a theoretical framework concerned\nwith the structure of self\u2013other relations, it\nmight be possible to explain the present find-\nings in terms of disturbances in the self-0other\nmonitoring of actions ~e.g., Russell & Jarrold,\n1999! rather than deficits in interpersonal en-\ngagement. Finally, given that participants\u2019 rates\nof smiling during the sharing looks in our study\nwere similar to rates previously reported for\nrates of positive affect in joint attention ~Kasari\net al., 1990; Mundy et al., 1992!, one might\nfocus on the children\u2019s difficulties in express-\ning and sharing affect during joint attention.\nWe do not know whether advocates for each\nof these positions would have predicted our\nfindings, and so we acknowledge that the study\ncannot rule out explanations that either con-\nflict with our own, or offer a complementary\naccount on a different level of explanation.\nConsider what is perhaps the most plausi-\nble alternative explanation for the present find-\nings: the social-orienting model of autism\nproposed by Mundy and Neal ~2001!. These\nauthors suggest that \u201can early cardinal deficit\nin social-orienting and joint attention contrib-\nutes to a severe impoverishment of social in-\nformation processing input during infancy and\npreschool development in children with au-\ntism\u201d ~pp. 139\u2013140!. This disturbance \u201cmay\nreflect an early onset error in sensitivity to the\nreward value of social interaction . . . @but# the\nmechanism of attenuation in social reward sen-\nsitivity is poorly understood at this time\u201d\n~pp. 151\u2013152!. Importantly, and like our own\nhypothesis, this account stresses the motiva-\n426 J. A. Hobson and R. P. Hobson\ntional ~and potentially, affective! as well as\ncognitively structuring aspects of propensities\nto engage with other persons. Whether or not\nidentification is as foundational as we believe,\nand whether a limited propensity to identify\nwith others explains the \u201cattenuation in social\nreward sensitivity\u201d among persons with au-\ntism, it remains important for alternative theo-\nries such as the social-orienting account to\nexplain role-reversing aspects of communica-\ntion and imitation and the interpersonally\ngrounded movements in stance manifest among\ntypically developing infants of around 1 year\nold, and relatively limited among those with\nautism. Arguably, the notion of identification\nis also apt for explaining why, if one applies\nappropriate measures to assess qualities of in-\nterpersonal relatedness, then one finds evi-\ndence of marked impairment in autism ~e.g.,\nGarc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, Lee, & Hobson, in press; Hob-\nson & Lee, 1999!.\nFinally, there are philosophical and logical\nreasons why one might invoke a process like\nidentification to explain how sharing of ex-\nperiences ~Hobson, 1989!, or adjustment of\nperspective through responsiveness to the at-\ntitudes of others, or the emergence of reflec-\ntive self-awareness ~Cooley, 1902; Hobson,\n1990; Mead, 1934!, or even the acquisition of\ncontext-sensitive language and creative sym-\nbolic thinking ~Adamson, 1995; Hobson, 2000;\nWerner & Kaplan, 1963!, emerge in the course\nof early development. Sharing experiences en-\ntails that to some degree, one participates in\nanother person\u2019s psychological stance vis-\u00e0-\nvis objects or events, so that one achieves a\nnow expanded subjective state. As the philos-\nopher Campbell ~2002! describes, in sharing\nit is constitutive of your experience that the\nother is, with you, attending to something ~and\nfor related perspectives see Br\u00e5ten, 1998; De-\ncety & Sommerville, 2003; Hobson, 1993,\n200202004; Gallese & Goldman, 1998; Melt-\nzoff & Brooks, 2001; Mundy, 2003; Toma-\nsello, 1995!.\nThere remains much to discover about the\nbases for, and development of, the process or\nprocesses of identification. The most in-depth\ntreatment of identification has been within\npsychoanalytic writings, and it is clear that\nalthough Freud ~195501921! considered iden-\ntification to be a basic feature of mental life\nthat underlies empathy, he also wrote of more\ncomplex forms such as identification with one\u2019s\nfather. It is not surprising that the notion of\nidentification has links with other current ac-\ncount of self\u2013other connectedness such as those\ninspired by neurofunctional evidence for mir-\nror neurones ~e.g., Decety & Sommerville,\n2003; Gallese, 2001! and theoretical treat-\nments of early imitation, especially by Melt-\nzoff ~e.g., Meltzoff & Moore, 1998a!. There is\nalso evidence from functional magnetic reso-\nnance imaging findings ~Dapretto et al., 2006!\nand EEG patterns of mu frequency suppres-\nsion ~Oberman et al., 2005! that such function-\ning may be atypical among children with\nautism ~Williams, Whiten, Suddendorf, & Per-\nrett, 2001!. The points we stress are, first, that\nwe are dealing with the propensity to be moved\ninto the psychological stance of another per-\nson, even as one relates to that someone else\nfrom one\u2019s own position and, second, that this\ninvolves being moved in attitude and affective\norientation, not merely copying actions. Inso-\nfar as this structure of self\u2013other engagement\n~being drawn into and encompassing the ori-\nentation of the other so that this yields sharing\nof subjective mental states and at the same\ntime a new potential orientation for oneself !\nis critical in shaping one\u2019s experience of so-\ncial relations, identification provides the basis\nfor a developmental series of increasingly elab-\norated representations of self\u2013other relatedness.\nSuch an account has important implica-\ntions for understanding typical development,\nas well as for characterizing the developmen-\ntal psychopathology of autism. For example,\ndifferences in children\u2019s ability to incorporate\nthe attitudes of others through identification\nmay have significant implications for their\nachieving new perspectives or \u201ctakes\u201d in rela-\ntion to the world ~through imitation, social\nreferencing, joint attention, and so on!, a new\nreflective stance in relation to themselves and\ntheir own mental contents ~as in metarepresen-\ntation!, and the development of social emo-\ntions such as guilt and concern ~Hobson,\nChidambi, Lee, & Meyer, 2006!. Corre-\nspondingly, if it is the case that children with\nautism are limited in the propensity to identify\nwith others, then this may contribute to their\nIdentification: The missing link? 427\nrelative lack of initiative in creating or respond-\ning to new conceptual perspectives, as well as\nto their restricted and abnormal linguistic and\nsocial\u2013communicative repertoires and limita-\ntions in executive functioning ~e.g., Dawson\net al., 2002; Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al., in press; Grif-\nfith, Pennington, Wehner, & Rogers, 1999;\nMinshew, Meyer, & Goldstein, 2002!.\nIt remains to consider how one might con-\nduct further tests of the hypothesis that chil-\ndren with autism have a limited propensity to\nidentify with other people. There is a diffi-\nculty here: there may be sustained joint atten-\ntion or alternating looks between the world\nand someone else that reflect only minimal or\nmoderate amounts of sharing of experience,\nor instances when the copying of actions may\nnot be the outcome of engagement with the\nperson who acts ~as discussed in Hobson &\nLee, 1999!. From a complementary perspec-\ntive, the pull to identify with someone else\nmay account for a part of the propensity to\nimitate at all, even when the copying is of\ngoal-directed actions ~where identification need\nnot structure the form of the imitation!. There-\nfore, one challenge for future studies is to find\nnew ways to examine whether there are in-\ndeed aspects of psychological functioning that\nare potentially dissociable according to whether\nor not they entail identification, and whether\nthese bear meaningful relations to one an-\nother. For example, we have adopted this\nperspective in designing studies involving par-\nticipants with autism on nonverbal communi-\ncation ~and specifically the coordination of\nhead shaking and nodding between conversa-\ntional partners: Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al., in press!,\nimitation ~and specifically the imitation of\n\u201cstyle\u201d: Hobson & Lee, 1999; Hobson &\nMeyer, 2007!; and the use of personal pro-\nnouns ~e.g., Lee, Hobson, & Chiat, 1994!. Each\nof these approaches affords the opportunity to\nevaluate the degree to which individuals ei-\nther relate to \u201csurface\u201d features of behavior or\ncommunication, or perceive, adapt to, and\nadopt the person-anchored stance that such\nbehavior or communication expresses. There\nis scope to extend such studies to changes in\nan individual\u2019s repertoire over time, for in-\nstance in relation to self-regulation or the abil-\nity to apply concepts flexibly.\nWe conclude by returning from the big pic-\nture to more local outcomes of this study. The\npresent results represent new and challenging\nfindings about the nature of joint attention\ndeficits in individuals with autism. Not only\nare such individuals less likely to look to an-\nother person when copying that person\u2019s ac-\ntions on objects, but they are also less prone to\nengage in sharing looks, and when this is the\ncase, they are also less likely to imitate the\nself-0other-orientated aspects of the actions\ndemonstrated. To explain this pattern of re-\nsults, it may be necessary to take account of a\nbroad set of social\u2013relational phenomena char-\nacteristic of typical and atypical development,\nand to rethink what an individual brings to\nand takes from experiences of interpersonal\nengagement. Future research promises to re-\nveal how far aspects of self\u2013other relatedness\nthat entail sharing and role flexibility are de-\nvelopmentally significant for the emergence\nand operation of higher cognitive functioning\nas well as for shaping social relations.\nReferences\nAdamson, L., & Bakeman, R. ~1985!.
