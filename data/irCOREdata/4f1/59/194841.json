In the\nfollowing years the basic concept was modi\fed, simulated\nand designed in detail by Stru\u00a8der et al. (1987). N-channel\nJFET electronics was integrated in 1992 (Pinotti et al.\n1993) and the \frst reasonably working devices were pro-\nduced in 1993.\nThe flight type large area detectors were fabricated\nin 1997 in the MPI semiconductor laboratory, with a\nsu\u000eciently high yield to equip XMM and ABRIXAS,\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.aanda.org or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20000066\nL.

Since then, the o\u000ecial observing\nprogramme is under way. This contribution summarizes\nthe basic instrument features as previously planned and\nimplemented in orbit to date, as well as their scienti\fcally\nrelevant measured performance in space. We have included\norbit data up to September 2000.\n2. The concept of fully depleted pn-CCDs\nThe principle of sideward depletion in high resistivity sili-\ncon is the basis of a large variety of novel silicon detectors,\nsuch as silicon drift detectors, controlled drift detectors,\nactive pixel sensors | and pn-CCDs.\n2.1. The camera concept\nThe angular resolution of the XMM X-ray telescope in\nfront of the pn-CCD camera (mirror flight model 2, FM2)\nis 15 arcsec half energy width (HEW) at 1.5 keV and\n8 keV. This translates to 540 \u0016m position resolution re-\nquired in the focal plane. For a given telescope perfor-\nmance the concept of sideward depletion allows for an\noptimum adaption of the pixel size to the X-ray optics,\nvarying from 30 \u0016m up to 300 \u0016m. The FWHM of the\npoint spread function (PSF) is 6.6 arcsec. A pixel size of\n150 \u0016m\u0002 150 \u0016m (4.1 arcsec) was chosen, with a position\nresolution of 120 \u0016m, resulting in an equivalent angular\nresolving capability of 3.3 arcsec. The energy response is\nhigher than 90% at 10 keV because of the sensitive thick-\nness of 300 \u0016m. The low-energy response is given by the\nvery shallow implant of the p+ back contact; the e\u000bective\n\\dead\" layer is of the order of 300 \u0017A (Hartmann et al.\n1997). High time resolution is a consequence of the parallel\nreadout of 64 channels per subunit; in total 768 channels\nfor the entire camera. High radiation hardness is built in\nby avoiding active MOS structures and by the fast trans-\nfer of the charge in a depth of more than 10 \u0016m below the\nsurface. For low energy protons, imaged through the X-ray\noptics (Aschenbach 2001) the pn-CCD is \\self shielding\",\nbecause the ionizing radiation has to propagate through\n290 \u0016m of silicon before damaging the transfer channel\nand decreasing charge transfer e\u000eciency (CTE). As there\nis only a negligible transmission of protons through the\nX-ray optics above 500 keV, there is no problem for the\npn-CCD with low energy protons at all. Measurements in\na proton accelerator by Meidinger et al. (2000) with up to\n2 109 10 MeV protons per cm2, equivalent to 4 times the\nexpected 10 year XMM irradiation in space, only showed\na degradation of about 30 eV in the FWHM of the MnK\u000b\nline. Kendziorra et al. (2000) tested the pn-CCDs with low\nenergy proton up to 1.4 109 protons per cm2. No change of\nthe detector\u2019s properties was seen.

After integration, they are transferred to the on-\nchip ampli\fer. Each CCD column is terminated by an on-chip\nJFET ampli\fer\npeaks at 70 keV and 170 keV, was a factor of 1000 above\nthe expected low energy proton flux in orbit. Up to now,\nno measurable degradation due to radiation damage was\nfound in orbit.\n2.2. The basic principles of pn-CCDs\nThe schematic view into the pn-CCD in Fig. 1 already in-\ntroduces intuitively the advantages of the concept: X-rays\nhit the detector from the rear side. In case of an X-ray\ninteraction with the silicon atoms, electrons and holes\nare generated. The average energy required to form an\nelectron-hole pair is 3.7 eV at \u221290 \u000eC. The strong elec-\ntric \felds in the pn-CCD detector separate the electrons\nand holes before they recombine. Signal charges (in our\ncase electrons), are drifted to the potential minimum and\nstored under the transfer registers. The positively charged\nholes move to the negatively biased back side, where they\nare \\absorbed\". The electrons, captured in the potential\nwells 10 \u0016m below the surface can be tansferred towards\nthe readout nodes upon command, conserving the local\ncharge distribution patterns from the ionization process.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 1, each CCD line is terminated by\na readout ampli\fer. The focal plane layout is depicted in\nFig. 2. Four individual quadrants each having 3 pn-CCD\nsubunits with a format of 200 \u0002 64 pixel are operated in\nparallel.\nThe spatially uniform detector quality over the entire\n\feld of view is realized by the monolithic fabrication of\n12 individually operated 3\u0002 1 cm2 pn-CCDs on a single\nwafer (see Fig. 2). No inhomogenities were observed in the\ntested energy range from 700 eV up to 8 keV, the measured\nflatness of the homogeneity measurements was always lim-\nited by Poisson statistics. Figure 2 shows the insensitive\nor partially sensitive gaps in between the di\u000berent CCDs\nand quadrants. As all CCDs are monolithically integrated\nL20 L.

Taking into ac-\ncount the residual partial pressure inside the camera of less\nthan 10\u22125 mbar, formation of monolayers of e.g. ice on the\nradiation entrance window should not occur.\n2.3. Operating modes\nCCDs have originally been designed for photon inten-\nsity imaging, not single photon counting in a spectro-\nscopic mode. To make CCDs useful for X-ray imaging and\nspectroscopic applications simultaneously, they must be\noperated such that only one X-ray photon hits the\nL. Stru\u00a8der et al.: The European Photon Imaging Camera on XMM-Newton: The pn-CCD camera L21\ndetector without an overlap in time and position of an-\nother photon. The design of the readout modes was driven\nby the assumption that the local photon flux should be\nbelow 140 events per pixel and integration time. To adapt\nthe X-ray camera readout mode to the point source bright-\nness, the integration time of the CCD camera can be short-\nened { by reducing the area to be read out. Under the\ncost of sensitive area the photon flux can be increased.\nFigure 3 shows which part of the CCD array is read out\nin the di\u000berent modes. Table 1 contains the most impor-\ntant parameters of the pn-CCD readout modes. A detailed\nsummary was given by Kuster et al. (1999).\n2.3.1. The full frame and the extended full frame mode\nIn the pn-CCD\u2019s full frame mode, a complete readout cycle\ntakes 73.3 ms for one individual CCD subunit. Within that\ntime, 4.6 ms (200\u000223 \u0016s) are needed for the readout itself,\nand 68.7 ms are used for the integration of the image.\nThis timing schedule leads to 6.2% \\out-of-time events\",\ni.e. events which hit the detector during the readout. In\nthe extended full frame mode the X-ray integration time\nis 199.2 ms with again 4.6 ms readout, leading to 2.3%\nof out-of-time events only. The extended full frame mode\nis suggested for the observation of extended objects. The\ntime resolution in both cases is the total cycle time, i.e.\nphoton integration time plus readout time.\n2.3.2. The large and small window mode\nBoth window modes are operated similar to a conventional\nframe store mode, where in our case the storage area is not\ncovered by an X-ray blocking shielding. No bright source\nshould be focussed on the storage area, because it could\ncontaminate the information integrated in the image area.\nThe window modes as shown in Fig. 3 reduce the \feld\nof view to reduce the number of out-of-time events and to\nimprove the time resolution and \fnally increase the pile-\nup limit for bright sources. In the large window mode the\ninner half of the CCD is used for imaging, then rapidly\ntransferred towards the readout node (720 ns per CCD\nline) and eventually read out, similar to the full frame\nmode. During the fast transfer the image outside the de-\n\fned FoV is automatically cleared. The time resolution is\nlowered to 47.7 ms and the amount of out-of-time events\ndrop below 0.2% in the large window mode. The small\nwindow mode operates comparably. The di\u000berence is that\nthe \feld of view is further reduced to 63 \u0002 64 pixels and\nonly one quadrant is operated instead of four. The time\nresolution drops to 5.7 ms and out-of-time event contri-\nbution is 1.1%. The small window mode only uses CCD0\nof quadrant 1, i.e. the focal CCD.\n2.3.3. The timing and burst mode\nOnly the CCD0 from quadrant 1 is operated in the\nfast modes. The timing mode forms macro-pixels of\nFig. 4. Mechanical structure of the pn-CCD camera system.\nX-rays imaged through the telescope enter the detector from\nthe bottom\n10\u00021 pixels. In one dimension (64) the position resolution\nis maintained while the other 10 pixels are read out only\nafter 9 fast transfers without electronic processing. That\nmeans, that 10 pixels along a column are integrated on\nthe readout node. The position information within those\n10 pixels is lost, it is conserved in the perpendicular di-\nrection. The time resolution is then 30 \u0016s.\nThe burst mode rapidly transfers 179 pixels and then\nreads the content of CCD0 in the conventional way. This\nallows for a 7 \u0016s time resolution and up to 60 000 counts\nper second in the PSF. After each read out, the entire\nCCD is cleared from signals. The duty cycle (life time)\nin this mode is only 3%. The strongest sources can be\nobserved in that mode.\n2.4. The mechanical and thermal concept of the\npn-CCD camera system\nThe camera housing is mainly made out of aluminum, the\naverage integrated equivalent aluminum thickness, shield-\ning the CCD from cosmic ionizing radiation is roughly\n3 cm. The aluminum (AlZnMgCu1,5) contains Si, Fe,\nCu, Mn, Mg, Cr, Zn and Ti. In total, these \\trace\" el-\nements represent about 10% of the total mass. Figure 4\nshows a cross section through the pn-CCD camera sys-\ntem. The main components are the radiator, cold \fnger,\nproton shield and the printed circuit board with the inte-\ngrated preampli\fers (CMX and TMX) and the pn-CCD,\nmounted in an invar ring. The interconnections between\nthe CCD and the surrounding electronics on the PC board\nare wedge-bonded. About 900 bonds were required, all\nindividually coated, to improve their mechanical stability.\nThe invar consists mainly of Ni, Mn, Si, C and Fe.\nThe PC board contains beside its Mo core Cu lines as\nmetallization layer1. A spider type support structure,\n1 As you will see later, most of the K\u000b and K\f lines of the\nmentioned atoms appear as fluorescence lines in the calibration\nspectra in Fig. 6.\nL22 L.

Four positions are equipped\nwith thick, medium and two thin \flters as speci\fed in\nTable 2. A calibration fluorescent source (AlK\u000b and MnK\u000b\nand MnK\f, 1.487 keV and 5.894 keV and 6.489 keV resp.)\ncan illuminate the CCD through the \flter wheel upon\ncommand. The total count rate of the calibration source\non the detector is of the order of 100 counts per second,\nthe half-life of 55Fe is 2.7 years. The spatial distribution of\nthe X-rays from the calibration source is inhomogeneous\nover the \feld of view.\nThe actual planning foresees an operating temperature\nof the pn-CCD of \u221290 \u000eC during the whole mission. An\nactive temperature control stabilizes the chip temperature\nto better than 0.1 K. The temperature is measured on the\nCCD directly and on the invar ring. The thermal design\nwas made to achieve CCD temperatures as low as \u2212140 \u000eC\nwhile dissipating 0.9 W of power in the focal plane.\nThe electronic concept was designed with a high degree\nof redundancy. The four quadrants of the CCD wafer are\noperated and controlled seperately. In addition the three\nCCDs of one quadrant can be electrically adjusted almost\nindependently. The relevant supply voltages and currents\nof each CCD are programmable from ground. This enables\nthe instrument team to modify operating conditions in\ncase of performance degradation, if needed.\n3. Instrument performance\nThe pn-CCD camera system was submitted to an inten-\nsive ground calibration programme. A detector response\nmatrix was \flled with measured data and modelled in-\nterpolations, where no data were available. Within the\nmeasurement accuracy the in-flight performance does not\nFig. 5. Quantum e\u000eciency (QE) of the pn-CCD with a fully\ndepleted thickness of 300 \u0016m\ndeviate from on-ground calibrations under the same\noperating conditions (Briel et al. 2000).\n3.1. Quantum e\u000eciency\nThe fully depleted 300 \u0016m of silicon determines the detec-\ntion e\u000eciency on the high energy end, while the qual-\nity of the radiation entrance window is responsible for\nthe low energy response. Figure 5 shows the result of the\nabsolute quantum e\u000eciency calibration at PTB (BESSY\nsynchrotron in Berlin) and LURE (synchrotron in Orsay,\nParis). All measurements were made under conditions\ncomparable to space operation. The drop of quantum e\u000e-\nciency (QE) at the lowest energies is caused by the proper-\nties of the silicon L-edge. The absorption length of X-rays\nin silicon at e.g. 150 eV is only 30 nm. A thin oxide layer\nof the order of 20 nm already absorbs about one half of the\nincident photons. The drop of about 5% of QE at 528 eV is\ndue to the additional absorption in the SiO2 passivation on\nthe detector surface. The other prominent feature in Fig. 5\nis the typical X-ray absorbtion \fne structure (XAFS) be-\nhaviour around the silicon K edge at 1.838 keV, enlarged\nin the inset of Fig. 5. At higher energies the solid line nicely\n\fts the photon absorption data for 300 \u0016m of silicon. The\nsolid line is a \ft to the measured data with a depletion\nthickness of 298 \u0016m. The QE is not supposed to change\nduring the XMM lifetime under nominal conditions.\n3.2. Energy resolution\nThe energy resolution is mainly determined by the statisti-\ncal fluctuations of the ionization process (Fano noise), the\ncharge transfer properties of the CCD and the electronic\nnoise of the readout node. Figure 6 shows about 31 hours\nof in-orbit data with the internal calibration source in the\n\\closed-cal\" position from june 2000. The signals selected\nare only those which hit the CCD in the last 20 lines\nof the 12 CCDs, the area, which also contains the focal\npoint. X-ray events from this region have undergone the\nL.

Calibration spectrum with the internal radioactive\nsource including the background with the \flter wheel in closed\nposition. The continuous background below the Mn lines arises\nmainly from photoelectrons stimulated from the 55Fe source in\nthe Al target. The iron K\u000b line between MnK\u000b and MnK\f is\nnot resolved\nmaximum number of charge transfers and therefore the\nhighest charge losses. The AlK\u000b, the MnK\u000b and MnK\f\nand the MnK\u000b escape peak are clearly visible. The CuK\u000b\nand CuK\f peaks are fluorescence lines from the printed\ncircuit board, generated by ionizing particles traversing\nthe whole pn-CCD camera. The other fluorescence lines\n(e.g. KK\u000b, TiK\u000b, VK\u000b, CrK\u000b, FeK\u000b, NiK\u000b, ZnK\u000b) and\nothers are trace elements in the aluminum structure of the\ncamera and the invar ring holding the pn-CCD wafer. The\nenergy resolution in the full frame mode is extracted from\nthe internal calibration source including all kind of X-ray\nbackground. Over the \frst 9 months the peak position\nand the FWHM are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. At MnK\u000b the\nFWHM is 161 eV in the focal point, it is 152 eV averaged\nover the whole CCD and is 140 eV close to the readout\nnodes. The energy resolution improves in the extended full\nframe mode to 148 eV (FWHM) averaged over the entire\nchip. The AlK\u000b resolution is 111 eV (FWHM) for the full\nframe and 105 eV in the extended full frame mode. Due\nto the heavy overlap of many lines and because of the un-\nderlying continuous background the energy resolution is\nslightly better for monochromatic radiation.\n3.3. Instrument stability\nThe long term instrument stability is checked routinely in\nterms of housekeeping data from all relevant camera pa-\nrameters and by analysing the spectroscopic performance\nof the on-board calibration source. Figure 7 shows the vari-\nation of the MnK\u000b peak position as a function of time after\nlaunch. Within less than 1 ADU count (5 eV) all measur-\nment points are compatible with the pre-launch data.\nThe strong solar flare on July-14 did not leave any\nmeasurable damage in the pn-CCD camera.\nThe variation of the peak position (see Fig. 7), e.g.\nat the day 200 and 220 in the year 2000, was due to a\nstrong temperature drop (approximately 10 K) of elec-\ntronic boxes outside of the camera housing, causing gain\nchanges and shifts in the analog-to-digital conversion. The\npeak shift is correlated with satellite commands influenc-\ning the thermal budget. On ground, the change of the\npeak position is corrected. As can be seen in Fig. 8 the\npeak shift had no e\u000bect on the energy resolution. The error\nbars in Fig. 8 comprise only the statistical errors, system-\natics are not included. The larger error bars in CCD 10,\n11 and 12 reflect the fact, that this area of the focal plane\nwas only poorly illuminated by the calibration source. The\nvariance of the FWHM at the MnK line including 36 ex-\ntended calibration measurements over the last 9 months\nis only 1.8 eV. A peak shift due to CTE changes because\nof possible radiation damage is less than 5 eV.\n3.4. Instrument background\nAs can be seen in Fig. 6 two other features of the spec-\ntrum need some explanation. (a) The continuous back-\nground from the lowest energies up to the MnK lines.\nThis background is due to photo electrons from the Al\nfluorescence target, excited from the MnK X-rays from\nthe calibration source. Because of the very thin radia-\ntion entrance window of the pn-CCD the low energy elec-\ntrons can be clearly detected with high QE. This property\nis equally responsible for the high QE response for soft\nX-rays. (b) The flat background distribution for the high-\nest energies arises from Compton electrons, generated by\nX- and gamma rays.\nAnother source of instrument background is caused by\nhighly ionizing particles, being imaged by means of graz-\ning incidence reflection through the X-ray telescope. They\ncan be light and heavy ions as well as highly ionizing low\nenergy protons (Aschenbach 2001). The duration of the\nflares can be of the order of minutes up to hours, their oc-\ncurence is unpredictable (see e.g. Briel 2000). In case the\ndetectors register a signi\fcant increase of counts, the \flter\nwheel is put in closed position, but the EPIC instruments\nremain operational2.\nThe pn-CCD camera has the option to lower the gain\nof the signal processing electronics by a factor of 20\nto increase the dynamic range in the so-called low-gain\nmode above 300 keV. This mode is very useful to study\nbackground phenomena. Figure 9 shows an example of\nsuch a measurement. During an observation in low-gain\na sudden increase in count rate by a factor of 2.5 occurred\nin the CCD cameras without getting notice from the\n2 Observation is of course not possible, instrument data are\nnot processed, but the detectors are still running. Extended\ninstrument recovery times are avoided.\nL24 L.

In contrast to minimum ion-\nizing particles, the protons mainly produce single pixel\nevents;\n3. The protons lose typically 50 keV of energy in the thick\n\flters and about 20 keV in the thin \flters;\n3 The low energy proton flare was still ongoing after the drop\nin count rate after 2.7 104 s, but the camera was automatically\nswitched o\u000b and the \flter wheel closed because of the high\nnumber of counts.\n140\n160\n180 CCD  1\n140\n160\n180 CCD  2\n140\n160\n180 CCD  3\n140\n160\n180 CCD  4\n140\n160\n180 CCD  5\n140\n160\n180 CCD  6\n140\n160\n180 CCD  7\n140\n160\n180 CCD  8\n140\n160\n180 CCD  9\n140\n160\n180 CCD 10\n140\n160\n180 CCD 11\n140\n160\n180\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260\nCCD 12\nM\nn-\nK_\nal\nph\na:\n  F\nW\nHM\n  [e\nV]\nd.o.y. 2000\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140\nXMM rev. #\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n2000year\nmonth\nFig. 8.

The most probable track length in one single pixel\nis 150 \u0016m. The onboard processor is able to remove almost\n100% of the mips. The processing power onboard is not\nsu\u000ecient to remove them all. Post-processing on ground\nthen rejects 100% of the mips.\nL.

A circle with a radius of 7 arcsec characterizes\nthe half energy width of the telescope and therefore gives\na background estimate for a point source.\nThe analysis of the radiation background of all kinds\nwill be an ongoing activity because of the lack of pre-\ncise predictability, time transients and missing knowledge\nabout the composition, energy pro\fle, spatial distribution\nin the XMM orbit.\n4. Conclusions\nThe EPIC pn-CCD camera on XMM-Newton from the\nMax-Planck-Institut fu\u00a8r extraterrestrische Physik oper-\nates in orbit as calibrated on ground: The operating modes\nhave been tested and quali\fed in-orbit and o\u000ber adequate\nreadout schemes for all astronomical observations. The\nenergy resolution is the same as in the ground calibra-\ntions and the instrument performance is stable with time,\nshowing no radiation damage within the \frst nine months\nin orbit. The instrument background is in the process\nof being understood. Low energy protons can limit the\nsensitivity of observations, but do not damage the focal\nplane detector.\nAcknowledgements.
