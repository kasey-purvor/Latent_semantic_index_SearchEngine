Implementation is taken to include such factors\nas intervention setting, resources, planning, collabora-\ntions, delivery and macro-level socioeconomic contexts.\nUnderstanding how implementation affects intervention\noutcomes may help prevent erroneous conclusions and\nmisleading assumptions about generalisability, but\nimplementation must be adequately reported if it is to be\ntaken into account.\nMethods: Data on implementation were obtained from\nfour systematic reviews of complex interventions in\nworkplace settings. Implementation was appraised using\na specially developed checklist and by means of an\nunstructured reading of the text.\nResults: 103 studies were identified and appraised,\nevaluating four types of organisational-level workplace\nintervention (employee participation, changing job tasks,\nshift changes and compressed working weeks). Many\nstudies referred to implementation, but reporting was\ngenerally poor and anecdotal in form. This poor quality of\nreporting did not vary greatly by type or date of\npublication. A minority of studies described how\nimplementation may have influenced outcomes. These\ndescriptions were more usefully explored through an\nunstructured reading of the text, rather than by means of\nthe checklist.\nConclusions: Evaluations of complex interventions\nshould include more detailed reporting of implementation\nand consider how to measure quality of implementation.\nThe checklist helped us explore the poor reporting of\nimplementation in a more systematic fashion. In terms of\ninterpreting study findings and their transferability,\nhowever, the more qualitative appraisals appeared to\noffer greater potential for exploring how implementation\nmay influence the findings of specific evaluations.\nImplementation appraisal techniques for systematic\nreviews of complex interventions require further devel-\nopment and testing.\nThe case has been made for providing policy-\nmakers with synthesised, detailed and robust\naccounts of the implementation of effective inter-\nventions in order to make better progress in\ntackling population morbidities and inequalities.1\nAdvocates of a staged approach to the development\nand evaluation of complex interventions have\nalso stressed the importance of accurately\ndefining interventions and promoting effective\nimplementation.2 Implementation refers to the\ndesign and delivery of interventions.3\u20136 The way\nan intervention is implemented may influence its\noutcomes, and evaluations that do not take this\ninto account risk (for example) misinterpreting\nnegative outcomes that result from poor imple-\nmentation as evidence that interventions are\ninherently ineffective.7 8 We developed a tool to\nappraise the quality of reporting of implementa-\ntion and applied this tool to four systematic\nreviews of complex intervention evaluations affect-\ning the workplace.\nImplementation and complex interventions\nResearchers and policy-makers have called for\nevidence from systematic reviews of social inter-\nventions affecting so-called \u2018\u2018upstream\u2019\u2019 health\ndeterminants such as employment, housing, trans-\nport, etc.9 10 Such interventions are often complex\nand difficult to evaluate.11 12 They may involve\nmultiple, context-specific interventions and an\nunstandardised approach to implementation.13\nIn our experience of conducting systematic\nreviews of \u2018\u2018upstream\u2019\u2019 interventions, it is often\ndifficult from the reporting of a complex interven-\ntion evaluation to determine: (1) what exactly the\nintervention entailed; (2) whether the intervention\nwas implemented fully or adhered to good practice\nguidelines; and (3) whether there were confound-\ning factors in the wider social context that would\naffect the outcome of the intervention.14\u201321 This\ncontrasts with reports of less complex interven-\ntions in which (1) the intervention is clear (eg a\nspecific drug); (2) intervention delivery was pre-\nscribed through a detailed protocol; and (3) at least\nsome attempt was made from the planning stage\nonwards to identify and reduce bias associated\nwith key confounders.\nImplementation appraisal\nImplementation appraisal is not a new concern.22\u201329\nSome systematic reviews have considered whether\ninterventions were delivered as prescribed by the\nstudy protocol (\u2018\u2018treatment integrity\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018pro-\ngramme adherence\u2019\u2019).30 However, appraisal tools\nused by systematic reviewers usually focus on the\nmethodological characteristics of primary studies\nrather than implementation issues.30 31 Such tools\noften take the form of checklists, although the\npractice of using checklist scores to appraise studies\nis problematic, leading some to advocate alterna-\ntive approaches.31 32\nResearch report\n4 J Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:4\u201311. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.071233\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nSystematic reviews that attempt to rigorously appraise the\nimplementation of complex interventions are the exception\nrather than the rule. A recent review of community-based injury\nprevention initiatives, which included appraisals of evidence on\nimplementation, found that reporting of implementation was\npoor.33\nWe developed and incorporated an appraisal checklist into\nfour systematic reviews of organisational-level workplace\ninterventions, along with a less structured exploration of textual\naccounts of implementation in the included studies.17\u201320 The\nchecklist covered reporting of intervention design (including\nwhether or not interventions were specifically designed to affect\nemployee health), target population, delivery, psychosocial factors\nand the characteristics of population subgroups differentially\naffected by the interventions. Our primary aim was to appraise\nthe reporting of implementation in primary studies; our study\nalso considered whether or not there was evidence to suggest that\nhigher standards of reporting were an indication of greater\nmethodological rigour.34\nMETHODS\nThe four reviews that incorporated our appraisal tool synthe-\nsised evidence on the health effects of (1) workplace interven-\ntions to increase employee control and participation in decision-\nmaking;17 (2) changes to team structures and work allocation\naffecting employees\u2019 day-to-day tasks;18 (3) the health effects of\ninstigating compressed working weeks;19 and (4) shift work\ninterventions.20 Table 1 summarises the intervention types in\nthese reviews. Their methods and outcomes have been described\nelsewhere.17\u201320\nOur original checklist contained 28 criteria. These criteria\nwere adapted from a number of sources, particularly Rychetnik\net al, whose work had prompted our initial interest in\nimplementation.3 4 27 35\u201338 Two reviewers (ME and CB) piloted\nthis checklist independently using 12 studies (taken from the\nparticipation and task restructuring reviews). On comparing\ntheir pilot appraisals, the reviewers agreed that the checklist had\nbeen difficult to interpret and apply consistently, and they\ncriticised both its content and its face validity. The reviewers\nascribed these problems to the checklist being unclear (often\nbecause criteria had been adapted from other contexts). The\npilot checklist also coped poorly with ambiguities in reports of\nimplementation (often, the answers to specific checklist criteria\nwere implied rather than explicitly stated in the brief reports of\nimplementation we identified\u2014and it was often difficult to\nagree on the point at which reviewers could distinguish mere\nimplication from reported fact). We decided that it would be\npreferable to work with a smaller number of broader criteria,\nand hence we shortened the checklist.\nThe final checklist included 10 criteria (response: yes\/no).\nStudies were categorised by an implementation appraisal score\n(out of 10\u2014one point for the presence of each criterion),\ndistinguishing the \u2018\u2018lowest\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018intermediate\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018higher\u2019\u2019\nscoring studies. The checklist is presented in table 2.\nTwo reviewers (ME and CB, or CB and MP) independently\napplied the checklist to all the studies included in the four\nsystematic reviews. Differences were resolved through consulta-\ntion. We then used cross-tabulations to explore relationships\nbetween quality appraisal scores from our checklist and data on\nevaluation study designs, and with psychosocial and health\noutcomes (previous studies have suggested that more rigorous\nevaluations may be less likely to report positive outcomes).34 We\nalso explored whether reporting of implementation differed by\ndate of publication (ie whether or not reporting has improved in\nrecent years) and type of publication (ie whether reporting is\nbetter or worse in peer-reviewed journals compared with other\nforms of publication).\nReported text that described implementation processes were\nalso extracted from each study by one reviewer and checked by\nanother to aid a less structured analysis of reporting of\nimplementation for each review. We considered relevant data\nfirst on a case-by-case basis and explored the interactions\nbetween reported planning and implementation characteristics,\ncontexts and outcomes. We discussed patterns and idiosyncra-\nsies across different studies and synthesised key findings using a\nnarrative approach. From this less structured process, we gained\nsome insights into how a minority of authors explained\noutcomes in terms of implementation characteristics.\nRESULTS\nImplementation appraisals were conducted on a total of 103\nstudies (references can be obtained from the original reviews).17\u201320\nTwenty-one studies were identified in the task restructuring\nreview, 18 studies in the employee participation review, 40 studies\nin the compressed working week review and 26 studies in the shift\nwork review.17\u201320 Two studies appeared in two reviews. In table 3,\nthe numerical implementation scores are summarised for all\nstudies and, in table 4, examples of summaries of implementation\nappraisals are presented for the higher scoring studies from each of\nthe four reviews.\nSummary of implementation appraisals\nMost studies achieved low scores (see table 3). The median score\nwas 3 out of 10 (range = 0 to 7; lower and upper quartiles = 1\nand 4). This varied slightly between reviews (from 2 to 4). The\nmedian score was 3 for studies published between 1996 and\n2000 and 2 for studies published between 2001 and 2006, and\nbetween 1991 and 1995 and before 1991.\nAs few studies achieved a high implementation score, we have\ncategorised the studies as follows: 14 \u2018\u2018higher\u2019\u2019 scoring studies\n(scoring >5 in our implementation appraisal), 38 \u2018\u2018intermedi-\nate\u2019\u2019 scoring studies (scoring 3 or 4 in our appraisal) and 51\n\u2018\u2018lowest\u2019\u2019 scoring studies (scoring ,3).\nThe most commonly reported implementation themes were\n\u2018\u2018motivation for intervention\u2019\u2019 (table 2, criteria 1\u2014appearing in\n76% of included studies) and employee support of the\nintervention (criteria 8\u2014appearing in 54% of the studies). All\nthe other themes were reported in less than a third of the total\nstudies. Criteria 10 (differential effects\/population characteris-\ntics) was only reported in 8% of the studies, while no study\ndescribed resourcing, costs or cost\u2013benefits of interventions\n(criteria 9).\nType of publication\nForty-nine included studies were published in peer review\nhealth journals, 41 in other peer review journals (mainly social\nscience, occupational and managerial studies journals) and 13 in\nedited books or theses. Twelve per cent of articles from health\njournals received higher implementation scores compared with\n15% of studies from both other journals and books or theses.\nForty-seven per cent of articles from health journals received\nlower implementation scores compared with 51% of studies\nfrom other journals and 54% from books or theses.\nImplementation and study design\nImplementation appraisal scores were not useful predictors of\nrobust study designs. We identified 32 prospective cohort\nResearch report\nJ Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:4\u201311. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.071233 5\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nTable 1 Details of the interventions included in the four systematic reviews\nInterventions Descriptions\nEmployee participation review15\nEmployee participation committees Employee representative committees (described variously, eg action teams, problem solving committees, etc). These often focus on\nidentifying and suggesting ways of overcoming workplace stressors. Some committees are led by external facilitators and\/or have\nmanagerial representation.\nFlexible working hours Employees are given more control over choosing their working hours.\nParticipation and individual-level\ninterventions\nEmployee committees combined with individual-level health promotion, education and behaviour programmes: such as anti-smoking or\nphysical activity interventions and training in relaxation techniques, stress reduction and communication skills.\nParticipation and ergonomic\ninterventions\nParticipatory committees combined with ergonomic interventions, ie attempts to reduce physical discomfort and workplace injuries by\nmodifying physical environments (including technological improvements) and advising on posture and lifting.\nTask restructuring review16\nProduction line Production line interventions that increase the variety of tasks performed by a worker, increase the skills utilised and place more\nresponsibility on individual workers.\nPrimary nursing Increasing the skills utilised by workers by increasing the variety of work tasks. Primary nursing and personal caregiving are patient-\norientated care systems in which each patient is assigned to an individual nurse\/carer; the nurse\/carer takes 24-hour responsibility for the\ncare of that patient including the planning and quality of the care provided.\nTeam working Workers are given more collective responsibility and decision-making power within the team, but responsibility is not shared and\nsupervisory structures remain in place.\nLean production Employee workloads are maximised, wasted time is reduced, tasks are distributed within the team, and work standards are determined by\nthe employees themselves rather than solely by management.\n\u2018\u2018Just in time\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Just in time\u2019\u2019 requires that products are made \u2018\u2018just in time\u2019\u2019 to be sold\u2014no stockpiling of products. Work groups, not individuals, are given\nautonomy and responsibility for specific tasks in order to achieve the required production flow.\nAutonomous work groups Autonomous work groups are characterised by employee self-determination and involvement in the management of day-to-day work\n(including control over pace, task distribution and training and recruitment).\nCompressed working week review17\nCompressed working week (CWW) Hours worked per day are increased while the days worked are decreased in order to work the standard number of weekly hours in less\nthan 5 days, eg the 12-hour CWW involves four 12-hour shifts (day, night) over 4 days with 3 or 4 days off. Under a 10-hour CWW, four 10-\nhour shifts are worked followed by 3 days off. The Ottawa system consists of three or four 10-hour morning or afternoon shifts for 4 days\nand 2 days off followed by a block of seven 8-hour nights and 6 days off.\nShift work review18\nChanges affecting shift rotation eg 1. Changing from slow to fast rotation: a change from six or seven consecutive shifts of the same type to a maximum of three or four.\neg 2. Changing from backward (night, afternoon, morning) to forward (morning, afternoon, night) rotation or vice versa.\neg 3. Changing from a rotating shift system to a permanent shift system.\nChanges affecting night work eg 1. Removal of night shifts.\neg 2. Increasing the rest period before the rotation onto night shift.\neg 3. Reduction in the number of consecutive night shifts.\nLater start and finish times Starting and finishing shifts 1 hour (in the studies we identified) later.\nWeekend shift changes Continuous (weekends on) to discontinuous shift system (weekends off) or vice versa.\nDecreased hours Decrease in shift length (eg from 8 hours to 6 hours).\nSelf-scheduling Self-scheduling enables individual shift workers to have some control over which shifts they work, their start times or when their rest days\noccur.\nCombined shift interventions Combinations of the above, most usually shift rotation combinations, eg change to fast and forward rotation.\nTable 2 Thematic checklist for the appraisal of the reporting, planning and implementation of workplace interventions\nTheme Checklist question for workplace reviews\n1. Motivation Does the study describe why the management decided to subject the employee population to the organisational change?\n2. Theory of change Was the intervention design influenced by a theory of change describing the proposed pathway from implementation to health\noutcome?\n3. Implementation context Does the study provide any useful contextual information relevant to the implementation of the intervention (eg political, economic or\nmanagerial factors)?\n4. Experience Does the study establish whether those implementing the intervention had appropriate experience (eg had the implementers conducted\nsimilar interventions before; or, if managers\/employees were involved, were they appropriately trained for the new roles)?\n5. Planning consultations Is there a report of consultation\/collaboration processes between managers, employees and any other relevant parties during the\nplanning stage?\n6. Delivery collaborations Is there a report of consultation\/collaboration processes between managers, employees and any other relevant parties during the\ndelivery stage?\n7. Manager support Were on-site managers\/supervisors supportive of the intervention (eg do the authors comment on managers\u2019 views of intervention)?\n8. Employee support Were employees supportive of the intervention (eg do the authors comment on employees\u2019 views of intervention)?\n9. Resources Does the study give information about the resources required in implementing the intervention (eg time, money, people, equipment)?\n10. Differential effects and population\ncharacteristics*\nDoes the study provide information on the characteristics of the people for whom the intervention was beneficial, and the\ncharacteristics of those for whom it was harmful or ineffective?\n*Note that, while consideration of differential effects involves analysis of outcomes, it also provides contextual information on the characteristics of population subgroups. This is of\ninterest when exploring the transferability of research findings and the mechanisms by which some interventions affect different types of people in different ways. Hence, we regard\nthis issue as relevant to explorations of implementation and context (as well as to outcome analysis).\nResearch report\n6 J Epidemiol Community Health 2009;63:4\u201311. doi:10.1136\/jech.2007.071233\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nstudies with appropriate controls and have classed these as the\nmost robust study designs: 36% of the studies with \u2018\u2018higher\u2019\u2019\nimplementation scores were \u2018\u2018most robust\u2019\u2019 compared with 45%\nof studies with intermediate scores and 20% of studies with low\nscores.\nImplementation and health effects\nAll 103 studies included in the reviews evaluated at least one\nhealth outcome.17\u201320 We have categorised the studies as follows:\n(1) those that reported at least one positive health outcome and\nno negative outcomes (n = 47); (2) those that reported at least\none negative health outcome and no positive outcomes (n = 14);\nand (3) those that report conflicting health outcomes (positive\nand negative) or reported little\/no change in all the health\noutcomes measured (n = 42).\nWe found no conclusive evidence that better reporting of\nimplementation might be associated with positive health\noutcomes. There was a similar range of implementation scores\nfor both the 47 studies with positive outcomes (47% scored ,3,\n40% scored 3 or 4, and 13% scored >5) and the 42 studies with\nconflicting\/little change in outcomes (45% scored ,3, 40%\nscored 3 or 4, and 14% scored >5). Fourteen studies reported\nnegative outcomes, of which 84% scored ,3, 15% scored 3 or 4,\nand none scored >5 on the implementation checklists.\nUnstructured appraisals of implementation\nWe extracted textual data on implementation from all the\nincluded studies for less structured, more qualitative appraisals.\nHowever, we focus on the 14 studies with negative health\noutcomes.\nImplementation reporting tended to be brief and anecdotal. It\nwas often unclear how authors had obtained their information\nabout implementation and whether they had taken steps to\navoid bias or error. These (important) objections aside, our more\nqualitative approach to implementation appraisal did appear to\nuncover potential explanations for how the implementation\ncharacteristics of some studies may have contributed to\nnegative outcomes.\nIn the participation review, we found that the only two\nstudies with negative health outcomes evaluated participatory\ninterventions that had been implemented in workplaces under-\ngoing organisational downsizing.17 We found that in the \u2018\u2018task\nvariety\u2019\u2019 review, negative health outcomes were more likely to\nresult from interventions that were motivated for business\nreasons (managerial efficiency, productivity, cost, etc) rather\nthan by employee health concerns.18 However, the studies\nidentified for the compressed working week and the shift work\nreviews provide evidence of positive, negative or \u2018\u2018little change\u2019\u2019\noutcomes resulting from interventions regardless of whether\nthey were motivated by business concerns, health concerns or\npressure from employees.19 20\nDISCUSSION\nPromoting effective implementation is regarded as a key stage in\nthe design and evaluation of complex interventions, and\nsyntheses of evidence from such evaluations should incorporate\ndata on implementation.1 2 We incorporated implementation\ndata into four systematic reviews of workplace interventions,\nusing both a specially developed checklist for measuring\nreporting of intervention design and implementation and a\nmore qualitative approach to assessing such reports. We found\nthat reporting of implementation was generally poor. Our\nexperience led us to reflect upon whether a checklist is the best\ntool for appraising implementation, particularly as our qualita-\ntive approach was easier to conduct and, we conclude, more\nuseful than the checklist-based approach.\nQuality of reporting\nIn most cases, authors of included studies presented brief and\nanecdotal reports of implementation. We identified few\ndescriptions of how authors obtained information about\nimplementation, whether any prior code of good practice\nexisted against which the quality of implementation could be\nmeasured, and whether any attempts were made to prevent\nbiased reporting of implementation. Roen and colleagues\nrecently published details of their attempts to appraise the\nimplementation of injury prevention interventions, which\nidentified similarly poor standards of reporting.33 However,\nthey found that studies with methodologically stronger designs\ntended to provide poorer descriptions of implementation. We\nfound no clear evidence of this relationship in our reviews.\nOur checklist-based appraisals did find that most included\nstudies provided some information about what motivated the\nimplementers to deliver the intervention, and whether employ-\nees supported them. However, data on cost-effectiveness and\ndifferential effects on population subgroups were rarely\nreported, despite the widely stated view that research to inform\npublic health policy and practice should provide evidence on\nthese issues.11 12 We also found that reporting of implementa-\ntion varied little by year or type of publication.\nWe also took a less structured (and less score-focused)\napproach to identifying reported data on implementation\nappraisal. This did identify some potential explanations for\nhow implementation may have affected psychosocial and health\noutcomes, eg organisational downsizing, lack of management\nsupport and the aim of increasing individual productivity\nwithout regard to employee well-being were all offered as\nexplanations for negative results. These issues were usually\ndescribed anecdotally within the studies, yet they often\nprovided the most plausible explanations for negative outcomes\navailable to reviewers.\nWe note that other systematic reviewers have employed more\nqualitative approaches to implementation appraisal.29 Our own\nexperience now leads us to advocate variations on this\nTable 3 Numerical summary of the results

alternative approaches)33 to implementation appraisal: in\nparticular to test inter-rater reliability and validity (the lack of\nsuch tests is a limitation to this study). We would focus our\nefforts on developing and testing qualitative implementation\nappraisal methods as we believe these may potentially provide\ngreater insights than a checklist-based approach.\nWe do not rule out the possibility that a systematic review\nchecklist could be developed to assist with implementation\nappraisals but, in our experience, this approach was proble-\nmatic. The checklist we developed assessed reporting of\nimplementation\u2014this is not the same as appraising the quality\nof implementation, but good reporting is one prerequisite for\nsuch an appraisal.1 Our checklist therefore helped to demon-\nstrate the urgent need for improved reporting, but did not help\nus to understand how implementation affected outcomes.\nIt should also be remembered that this paper only examines\nreviews of employment interventions. The generalisability of\nthese findings depends on the degree to which employment\nresearchers tend to report implementation differently from or\nsimilarly to researchers working in other fields.\nWe also note that our implementation checklist analysis\nexplored psychosocial and health outcomes. While it is\nlegitimate for public health researchers to be particularly\ninterested in outcomes relevant to their field, we recognise\nthat complex interventions such as those included in our\nreviews often have other outcomes (eg financial, managerial) of\nequal or greater importance to the implementers than health\noutcomes.\nQuality of implementation\nAs stated above, our checklist was not designed to appraise\nquality of implementation. Even if we could have directly\nappraised the quality of implementation, the checklist scores\nwould still have been problematic. Summary appraisal scores\nreveal the number and variety, but not the importance, of\nreported implementation characteristics. It may only take one\nflaw in the implementation to cause an intervention to fail, so a\nhigh intervention score is no guarantee of effectiveness.32\nFurthermore, the development of a detailed checklist for\nmeasuring quality of implementation requires an a priori\nknowledge of the criteria that will distinguish well-implemen-\nted interventions from poorly implemented interventions.1 This\nmay be feasible in some areas of research, when there is a strong\nconsensus regarding standards of best practice, but that\nconsensus does not always exist for every type of intervention.\nWe attempted to develop such a list but quickly realised that\nthe included interventions were too varied and there was\noften no clear way of prescribing in detail what constituted\ngood or bad practice. We suspect that this uncertainty over best\npractice may increase with the complexity of an intervention,\nparticularly if the intervention is flexible in design and context\nspecific.\nFor example, what resources are sufficient to adequately\nresource an intervention? Is collaboration with employees\nalways desirable, or can interventions achieve similar or better\nresults if they are imposed by managers taking a \u2018\u2018strong leader\u2019\u2019\napproach? It may be desirable for people managing implemen-\ntation processes to have appropriate experience, but \u2018\u2018appro-\npriate\u2019\u2019 needs to be defined: must managers have prior\nexperience of delivering specific interventions, or is their general\nrole in management to be regarded as appropriate enough?\nThe answers to all these questions seem to us to depend on\nthe intervention and specific circumstances.\nTable 4 Continued\nCitation Intervention, study design and population details Implementation details* Score\n(6) Committee set up between the union and managers to monitor\nsafety in the new system\n(7) Supported by supervisors.

However, we would advise\ncaution against assuming that appraising the implementation of\ncomplex interventions is a simple matter. The appraisal tool we\ndeveloped\u2014like other appraisal tools\u2014could only assess how\nwell the implementation process was reported, rather than the\nquality of the process itself and, in most cases, reporting was\npoor. We also lacked detailed criteria on what constitute well-\nimplemented workplace interventions that could safeguard or\nimprove employee health.\nNonetheless, information on implementation and context is\ncrucial for a nuanced assessment of the impact of complex\ninterventions. Improvements in the reporting and appraisal of\nsuch information are overdue.\nAcknowledgements: This work was partly funded by ESRC grant no.
