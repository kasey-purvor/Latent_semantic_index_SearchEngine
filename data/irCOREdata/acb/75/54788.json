Recent work\nhas shown that the Si isotope (denoted by d29Si or d30Si) composition of deep sea sponges reflects the\navailability of dissolved Si during growth, and is a potential proxy for past deep and intermediate water\nsilicic acid concentrations. As with any geochemical tool, it is essential to ensure analytical precision and\naccuracy, and consistency between methodologies and laboratories. Analytical bias may exist between\nlaboratories, and sponge material may have matrix effects leading to offsets between samples and\nstandards. Here, we report an interlaboratory evaluation of Si isotopes in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic\nsponges. We review independent methods for measuring Si isotopes in sponge spicules. Our results show\nthat separate subsamples of non-homogenized sponges measured by three methods yield isotopic values\nwithin analytical error for over 80% of specimens. The relationship between d29Si and d30Si in sponges is\nconsistent with kinetic fractionation during biomineralization.

The fractionation factor during\na reaction from A to B, a, is defined by Eq. (1):\nxa \u00bc\nxSi\n28Si\n\u0002 \u0003\nA\nxSi\n28Si\n\u0002 \u0003\nB\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere x is either of the two minor isotopes, 29Si or\n30Si. The per mil (%) Si isotopic composition is expressed\nrelative to the NIST standard, NBS 28, according to\nEq.

(3):\n29a \u00bc 30 az; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere z,0.52 and depends on the ratio of the isotope masses\nand on whether the fractionation reaction is kinetic or in\nequilibrium (reviewed by Reynolds et al. 2007).\nA previous interlaboratory comparison has been published\nusing three isotopic standards: a rock standard IRMM-018,\na \u2018\u2018Diatomite\u2019\u2019 standard, and a highly fractionated SiO2\nmaterial, \u2018\u2018Big Batch\u2019\u2019, originally prepared at the University of\nCalifornia, Santa Barbara (UCSB) by Mark Brzezinksi and\nChristina de la Rocha (Reynolds et al. 2007). However,\nIRMM-018 is no longer produced commercially and did not\nshow a good level of reproducibility between research groups,\n34\nFig. 1. Scanning electron micrographs of sponge spicules: a.

Ocean circulation and\nbiogeographical variations in algal populations results in\nenriched Si(OH)4 in Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW)\ncompared to North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) (Garcia\net al. 2006). This difference allows dissolved Si to be used\nas a tracer of southern component water masses in the Atlantic\nover 103\u2013104 year timescales. Thirdly, whole ocean changes in\nSi cycling over long timescales (.104\u2013105 years) will be\nreflected in deep water Si(OH)4 concentrations to a greater\nextent than surface values, which are probably influenced by\nlocal processes such as productivity (de la Rocha & Bickle\n2005). The Southern Ocean has been the major sink of opal for\nthe past 2\u20133 million years, and is a key source area for such\npalaeoceanographic records (Cortese et al. 2004).\nThe Si isotopic composition of sponges has been recognized\nas a potential archive of deepwater Si chemistry (de la Rocha\n2003, Hendry et al. 2010, Wille et al. 2010). Siliceous\nsponges (Phylum Porifera, Classes Demospongea and\nHexactinella) produce needle-like skeletal elements,\ncalled spicules, from hydrated amorphous silica. Spicules\ncan be further subdivided into larger megascleres and\nsmaller microscleres (Fig. 1a & b). Uptake of ambient\nSi(OH)4 occurs via a sodium transporter, which resembles\nactive transporters isolated from other metazoans. The\nsilica deposition occurs about a central organic filament in\nthe axial canal of the filament. Biosilicification is carried\nout by sclerocyte cells both intra- and extra-cellularly and\nis controlled by the enzymes silicatein, which promotes\ncondensation reactions, and silicase, which dissolves silica\n(Uriz et al. 2000, 2003, Foo et al. 2004, Mu\u00a8ller et al. 2007).\nSilicatein is the predominant component of the axial filament\nand is found on the surface of spicules and in the extra-\ncellular space, resulting in lamellar growth (Mu\u00a8ller et al.\n2007). During these reactions, sponges fractionate Si isotopes\nwith respect to the ambient Si(OH)4, such that spicules have\nsome of the lightest Si isotopic signatures known in natural\nsystems (de la Rocha 2003).\nWith the development of Si isotopes in sponges as a\ngeochemical proxy, it is essential to determine analytical\nprecision and accuracy, and ensure there are no systematic\ndifferences between methodologies. Here, we present an\ninterlaboratory comparison of the Si isotopic composition\nof sponges from the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic\nPeninsula. We review two independent methods for sample\npreparation, using three different instruments for Si isotope\nanalysis. We show that sponge Si isotope ratios are\nhomogeneous and influenced strongly by environmental\nparameters. Further work on the sponge Si isotope uptake\nand systematics would benefit greatly from a suitable\ninterlaboratory reference standard. Although \u2018\u2018Diatomite\u2019\u2019,\nwhich contains non-opal impurities, and \u2018\u2018Big Batch\u2019\u2019\nreproduced well (d30Si,11.27 and -10.48% respectively),\nneither standard has an isotope composition or microstructure\nsimilar to sponges (Schroeder et al. 2008).\nMethods\nSample collection and initial preparation\nWe collected and analysed modern specimens of sponges\nfrom a north\u2013south transect across the Southern Ocean,\nencompassing a range of Si(OH)4 concentrations (12\u2013120mM)\nand depths (300\u20132500m). Sponges were collected aboard the\nRV Nathaniel B. Palmer from sites in the Drake Passage and\nScotia Sea (April\u2013May 2008; Fig. 1c). Additional samples\nwere collected from Anvers and Adelaide islands off the West\nAntarctic Peninsula. Spicules were isolated from organic\nmatter by heating three times in concentrated HNO3 and H2O2\n(reagent grade), rinsing each time with 18 MV Milli-Q water.\nDetrital lithogenic grains were then physically removed until\nvisual inspection showed the sample to comprise pure\nsponge spicules. The spicules were then further chemically\ncleaned by heating in 50% HNO3 and 10% HCl (in house\nTeflon distilled) for two hours, followed by five Milli-Q\nrinses. Subsamples were analysed by three different\nlaboratories using different methods: stepwise fluorination\nfollowed by gas-sourced Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry\n(IRMS) at the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory (NIGL;\nLeng & Sloane 2008), wet alkaline extraction followed by\nanalysis by NuPlasma Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled\nPlasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS) at Oxford\nUniversity (Georg et al. 2006, Hendry et al. 2010) and wet\nalkaline extraction followed by analysis by Neptune MC-ICP-\nMS (Van den Boorn et al. 2006, Wille et al. 2010, this study)\nat Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).\nStepwise fluorination\/IRMS (NIGL)\nThe subsamples were processed using stepwise fluorination,\ndesigned for both d30Si\/d29Si and d18O analysis of silica, to\nconvert the Si (and O) to a gaseous phase (Leng & Sloane\n2008). First, the samples were dehydrated at 2508C to remove\nsurface and loosely bound water. Secondly, the samples went\nthrough a pre-fluorination reaction with a stoichiometric\ndeficient quantity of bromine pentafluoride at low temperature\nto remove hydroxyl groups and any remaining loosely bound\nwater. Thirdly, the samples were fully fluorinated at 4508C for\n36 KATHARINE R. HENDRY et al.\n12 hours, during which the Si is converted to silicon\ntetrafluoride (SiF4), which is then measured off-line for\n28Si,\n29Si and 30Si simultaneously using a Finnegan MAT253 IRMS.\nRepeat measurements of standards indicate a reproducibility\nof,0.24% (2 SD) for d29Si and d30Si.\nWet alkaline extraction\/NuPlasma MC-ICP-MS (Oxford)\nThe subsamples were dissolved by wet alkaline extraction\n(Cardinal et al. 2007). Briefly, the spicules were dissolved\nin 4ml 0.2M NaOH per mg silica, left at 1008C for three\ndays, and sonicated on a daily basis to aid dissolution. The\nsolutions were acidified with 0.2M HCl (in house Teflon\ndistilled) to a pH. 2.\nThe Si concentrations of the dissolved samples and standards\nwere determined using a heteropoly blue photospectrometric\nmethod (Ultra Low Range solutions, Hach). Quantitative\nseparation of Si from major ions was achieved using a cation\nexchange resin (BioRad AG50W-X12; Georg et al. 2006). The\nstandard and samples (,0.4ml) were introduced to the\ncolumn, which contained a volume of wet resin at neutral pH\nsuitable for the amount of Na added (0.8 to 1.8ml). Si(OH)4 is\nin equilibrium with the anionic silicate species H3SiO4\n- for the\npH range 2\u20138 (Georg et al. 2006), and can simply be eluted\nwith Milli-Q water. Recent studies have shown pH does not\naffect Si yield or fractionation on the column (Savage et al.\n2010). Our previous tests have shown this method results in\n100% yields for both commercially available Si solutions and\ndissolved biogenic opal samples (Hendry et al. 2010, Hendry\nunpublished data). There are traces of organic matter bound\nwithin biogenic opal, including sponge spicules, which may\nform small silico-organic complexes that cannot be removed\nfrom the Si and may cause instabilities with plasma source\nmass spectrometry. However, our measurements of the organic\ncontent of sponge spicules show the organic content is,0.1%\nor lower, and any problems arising from this material\nwill be minimal.\nThe Si isotope measurements of the Si isotopes (28Si,\n29Si and 30Si) use the NuPlasma MC-ICP-MS (University\nof Oxford), again allowing simultaneous measurement of\nthe different isotopes. The mass spectrometer was operated\nin medium resolution mode to resolve interferences on\nmasses 28 (e.g. 14N14N1, 12C16O1), 29 (14N15N1, 13C16O1,\n12C17O1) and 30 (15N15N1, 13C17O1, 12C18O1). Samples\nwere introduced via a self-aspirating PFA micro concentric\nnebuliser (ESI) plugged into a Cetac ARIDUS-2 desolvator\nunit, supplied only with Ar and not N2. Uptake rates varied\nslightly, but were typically around 100mlmin-1 (Table I). The\nsamples were bracketed with a concentration-matched NBS28\nstandard (,600ppb Si) to correct for mass bias and drift\n(Georg et al. 2006, Reynolds et al. 2007), and isotope ratios\ncalculated according to Eq.

The instrument was operated in a\ndry plasma mode, with the sample introduced via a self-\naspirating PFA micro concentric nebuliser, plugged into\nan ARIDUS-1 (not connected to N2) with an uptake rate\nof 50mlmin-1, in high-resolution mode to resolve potential\ninterferences as outlined above. The instrument was left to\nstabilize after plasma ignition for approximately an hour\nbefore tuning on a daily basis, during which gas flow and ion\noptics are optimized for maximum sensitivity and peak shape\non 28Si (Fig. 2). Peak centring was carried out on 28Si prior to\nmeasurement. Operating conditions are outlined in Table I.\nMass bias and drift were accounted for by standard-\nsample bracketing matching samples and bracketing\nstandards. Our initial tests showed intensity matching of\nbracketing standards and samples of within 20% resulted in\nacceptable levels of reproducibility for the known reference\nstandards ( \u00b1 0.15% for d30Si).

Big Batch showed greater\nvariability (Table II), appearing to be more sensitive to drift\ndue to larger fractionation, perhaps as a result of matrix\neffects from its high molybdenum content (Reynolds et al.\n2007). Repeat measurements of sample aliquots, within and\nbetween runs, show typical variability, 0.1% for d29Si\nand d30Si. However, the sample size of measurements for\neach aliquot is small (n, 3), such that calculating standard\ndeviations is not valid, and so the long-term reproducibility\nfor diatomite is used as a more conservative estimate of\ntotal error (Table II).\nAll three methods show a very similar long-term\nreproducibility (2 SD, 0.2% for d30Si), in agreement\nwith the finding of the previous interlaboratory calibration\nof standards that differences between reported results\nshould be limited to 0.2% for d30Si (Reynolds et al. 2007).\nResults\nThe d30Si values of sixteen modern sponges measured at\nNIGL varied from approximately -0.5 to -4% (Table III), all\nFig. 4.

Subsamples from\nthese specimens had been previously analysed at Oxford\n(previously reported in Hendry et al. 2010). Note that\nalthough the spicules were not homogenized prior to\nanalysis, subsample measurements of any particular\nspecimen are in good agreement (Fig. 3; regressing\nOxford data on NIGL data yields r5 0.97, slope51.09,\nintercept50.06%). Over 80% of the specimens yielded d30Si\nvalues that agreed within \u00b1 0.2%, (i.e. agreement within\nanalytical error), and all agreed within \u00b1 0.3% (including\nOT3-111 and DR-111, two specimens of the same species of\ndemosponge). Repeat subsamples analysed at NIGL agreed\nwithin \u00b1 0.1% for d30Si (Table III).\nSubsamples from a sponge collected near the Antarctic\nPeninsula, LMG08, were measured by Oxford (Hendry\net al. 2010), NIGL and WHOI (both this study), and also\nshowed a high level of reproducibility (Fig. 4; Oxford\nd30Si5 -3.36 \u00b1 0.16% (one aliquot with repeat measurements;\nn5 8), NIGL (one aliquot) d30Si5 -3.3%, WHOI (all\nmeasurements, n5 16)5 -3.41 \u00b1 0.18%; WHOI (mean\nvalues for independent aliquots, n54) d30Si5 -3.40 \u00b1 0.10%,\nfor 2 SD).\nAll three laboratories show mass dependent measurements\nfor sponge samples, with the slope of the three isotope plot\nof d29Si vs d30Si, 0.51 (Fig. 5, Table IV, see discussion\nbelow).\nDiscussion\nIsotopic homogeneity in sponges\nThe agreement between the different laboratories, utilizing\ndifferent preparation and measurement techniques, indicates\nthat d30Si measurements obtained for Southern Ocean sponges\nare robust and there is no method dependent fractionation of\nSi isotopes. Furthermore, given that the subsamples were not\ntaken from a homogenized mass of spicules, our data also\nindicate there is a high level of homogeneity within Southern\nOcean sponges. There are other lines of evidence for isotopic\nhomogeneity within specimens of Southern Ocean sponge:\na) Spicules taken from external layers (dermal) and\ninternal layers (perenchymal) from a sponge collected\nin the Drake Passage have, within error, the same\nisotopic composition (dermal d30Si5 -2.87% and\nperenchymal d30Si5 -2.96%; Hendry et al. 2010).\nb) Core top measurements of megaspciules picked from\nScotia Sea sediments (d30Si, -3.9%) are within error\nof modern sponges living near to the core site\n(d30Si, -4.1%; Hendry et al. 2010), comprising\nboth mega and microspicules (Fig. 1a).\nKinetic uptake of Si by sponges\nThe relationship between ambient Si(OH)4 and isotopic\ncomposition of sponges suggests a growth rate effect (Hendry\net al. 2010). Kinetic uptake of Si has been observed during\nsponge growth (Fr\u00f8hlich & Barthel 1997) and supported by\nthe highly fractionated nature of sponge Si isotopes, and\nTable IV.

HENDRY et al.\nby theoretical isotopic fractionation models (Wille et al.\n2010). The relationship between d29Si and d30Si can be used\nto determine whether kinetic or equilibrium fractionation has\noccurred: equilibrium fractionation yields a slope on a three-\nisotope plot (Fig. 5) of 0.518 whereas kinetic fractionation\nresults in slopes of either 0.509 or 0.505 for Si atoms and\nSiO2 respectively (Reynolds et al. 2007). Data from all three\nlaboratories are consistent with kinetic fractionation (either\nSi or SiO2, Reynolds et al. 2007) within 95% confidence\nintervals calculated by model II linear regressions (Table IV),\nwhereas only data from one laboratory is within range of\nequilibrium fractionation. This supports the notion of kinetic\nuptake of Si by deep sea sponges in the Southern Ocean.\nUse of sponge spicules as geochemical archives\nUnderstanding the impact of surface biological production\non carbon export in the past relies on the reconstruction\nof the nutrient supply from upwelling deep waters, both\nwithin the Southern Ocean and further afield. Sponges\nare an ideal marine geochemical archive of deepwater\nnutrients, given their ubiquitous distribution on the oceans.\nWe confirm that Antarctic sponge Si isotopic composition\nshow a robust relationship with ambient Si(OH)4, are\ninternally homogeneous, and measurements are reproducible\nirrespective of preparation and analytical method. Two\nindependent calibrations, produced by different laboratories,\nshow ambient Si(OH)4 is the dominant control over both the Si\nisotopic composition of, and fractionation by, sponges collected\nin different sectors of the Southern Ocean (Hendry et al.\n2010, Wille et al. 2010; Figs 1c & 6). There is no consistent\nspecies specific offset in isotopic composition or\nfractionation: different species from the same site show\nsimilar isotopic composition and two specimens of the\nsame species from different Si(OH)4 environments show\ndifferent isotopic compositions (Hendry et al. 2010). There\nis no evidence for a significant influence of temperature,\npH, or salinity on isotopic fractionation (Hendry et al.\n2010, Wille et al. 2010). The scatter in the Si(OH)4\u2013d\n30Si\ncalibration, which may reflect secondary vital effects,\nresults in an uncertainty of any reconstructing Si(OH)4\nconcentration of approximately \u00b1 20mM (Hendry et al. 2010).\nThe relationship between Si(OH)4 and d\n30Si from the two\ncalibrations agree well between Si(OH)4 concentrations of\n,5 and 80mM. However, at concentrations,2mM, only\nsampled by one calibration, sponge d30Si become isotopically\nheavier than expected, suggesting either an exponential\nrelationship with Si(OH)4 concentration (Wille et al. 2010) or\na non-linearity arising from physiological stress under low Si.\nGiven the scatter in the calibration, a simple linear fit between\nd30Si and Si(OH)4 is likely adequate for most applications;\nfor shallow water environments experiencing low Si(OH)4,\nan exponential fit may be appropriate. Further work is required\nto validate this calibration in other ocean basins, experiencing\ndifferent nutrient regimes and physical environmental\nparameters. Culturing studies growing sponges under extreme\nconcentrations of Si(OH)4 (less than 5mM and greater than\n120mM) may also elucidate the linear vs exponential nature of\nthe relationship between Si(OH)4 and d\n30Si, and resolve the\ncause of scatter in the calibrations.\nSponge d29Si and d30Si standard\nThe isotopic homogeneity in sponges makes them an ideal\ntarget for a reference standard, which would be particularly\nvaluable should sponge spicules become a more commonly\nused geochemical archive. The sponge LMG08 has now\nbeen analysed by three laboratories, using two different\npreparation methods and three different instruments, and\nyielded (within error) the same value (mean d29Si value from\nthe three laboratories5 -1.72 \u00b1 0.01%, mean d29Si value of\nall measurements5 -1.72%, 2 SD50.08%; mean d30Si value\nfrom the three independent laboratories5 -3.35 \u00b1 0.06%,\nmean d30Si value of all measurements5 -3.37%,\n2 SD5 0.17%; Fig. 4). Additional subsamples are\navailable from the authors for future interlaboratory tests.\nConclusion\nThe Southern Ocean is an important location for studying\ndeepwater Si cycling because of the regional importance of\nglobal biological productivity and its sensitivity to well\ndocumented proximal climatic changes. Sponge spicule d29Si\nand d30Si are promising new proxies for past deepwater silicic\nacid concentrations, and Southern Ocean downcore records of\nspicules could be applied to a wide range of climatic and\npalaeoceanographic questions. We show here that Si isotopic\nmeasurements of Antarctic sponge spicules are robust and\nreproducible, confirming that the overriding control over\nsilicon isotopes is the ambient Si(OH)4 concentrations in\nwhich the sponges grow. The relationship between d29Si and\nd30Si is consistent with kinetic fractionation during sponge\ngrowth. Lastly, we suggest Southern Ocean sponges would act\nas an ideal new standard for future spicule analyses.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the captain and crew of\nthe RV Nathaniel B.
