INTRODUCTION \nIt is well known that chaotic behaviors may occur if second-order digital \nfilters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic are operating in the marginally stable region \nor in the unstable region [1,4,6-10,12,13]. Further results have been reported for \nmarginally stable third-order digital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic [3,13], \nas well as for marginally stable second-order digital filters with either a saturation-\ntype nonlinearity [2] or with a quantization-type nonlinearity [5,11]. \nHowever, we seldom design a \u2018digital filter\u2019 operating in the marginally stable \nregion or in the unstable region. Practically, we usually design digital filters operating \nin the stable region. In this paper, chaotic and related behaviors of stable second-order \ndigital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic are investigated. \n 2\nIf overflow does not occur, the trajectory of stable second-order digital filters \nwith two\u2019s complement arithmetic will converge to the origin on the phase plane. If \noverflow occurs, will the trajectory converge? If so, what are the fixed points and the \nset of initial conditions such that the trajectories will converge to those fixed points? \nBesides, some researchers have reported that limit cycles may occur [14-19]. What is \nthe relationship between the occurrence of limiting cycles and the behaviors of \nsymbolic sequences? Moreover, are there any fractal patterns exhibited on the phase \nplane? If so, what is the difference between the shapes of fractal patterns for the stable \nand the marginally stable second-order digital filters? \nIn section 2, we will outline the notations which are essentially those used in \nthe existing literatures [1-13]. In section 3, the behaviors of stable second-order \ndigital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic are presented. Comparisons between \nthe behaviors of stable and marginally stable second-order digital filters with two\u2019s \ncomplement arithmetic are discussed in section 4. Finally, concluding remarks are \npresented in section 5. \n \n2.

CONCLUDING REMARKS \nIn this paper, we have studied the behaviors of stable second-order digital \nfilters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic. It is found that the state vector of stable \nsecond-order digital filters with two\u2019s complement arithmetic may not converge to \nzero. The sets of initial conditions that the trajectories converge to those fixed points \nare polygons inside the unit square. Also, it is found that the occurrence of limit \ncycles and chaotic fractal patterns on the phase plane can be characterized by the \nperiodic and aperiodic behaviors of the symbolic sequences, respectively. The fractal \npattern is polygonal, whereas it is elliptical for the marginally stable case. \n \n 11\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n The work described in this paper was substantially supported by The Hong \nKong Polytechnic University. \n \nREFERENCES \n1.
