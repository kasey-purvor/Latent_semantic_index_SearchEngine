Introduction\n[2] Since Dungey [1954] proposed for the first time that\nthe long-period geomagnetic pulsations observed on the\nground might be the result of standing Alfve\u00b4n waves being\nexcited on geomagnetic field lines, a wealth of ground-\nbased and satellite observations have established the impor-\ntance of field line oscillations, and it has become recognized\nthat such waves transfer both energy and momentum\nthrough the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere system.\nThese processes are most significant in the high-latitude\nionosphere, where the magnetosphere-ionosphere interac-\ntion is strongest. The waves also act as an important\ndiagnostic of magnetospheric morphology and dynamics.\n[3] In general, ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves have an\nenergy source external to the Earth, such as an impulse in\nthe solar wind, solar wind buffeting, or the Kelvin-Helm-\nholtz instability on the magnetopause. However, the se-\nquence of events which connect such broadband boundary\noscillations to the resonant driving of an individual field line\nat its natural eigenfrequency is not straightforward. Initially,\na direct coupling between the wave source on the boundary\nand a local field line was proposed, which successfully\nexplained many observed features of field line resonances\n[e.g., Southwood, 1974]. The observed discrete frequency\nspectrum remained a puzzle, however, and subsequently\nglobal compressional oscillations of the magnetosphere,\nsetting the cavity formed by magnetospheric boundaries\ninto oscillation, were suggested as a cause of a local field\nline resonating at its characteristic frequency by Kivelson et\nal. [1984]. In this scenario the field line driven to resonance\nwas one whose eigenfrequency matched a natural frequency\nof the magnetospheric cavity. More recently, it has become\naccepted that the magnetospheric cavity oscillation is better\ndescribed as a magnetospheric waveguide, with the charac-\nteristic frequencies of the waveguide coupling to field line\noscillations [e.g., Harrold and Samson, 1992; Samson et al.,\n1992; Rickard and Wright, 1994]. Such a waveguide mode\nmay be excited directly by buffeting of the magnetosphere\nor through a broadband wave source on the magnetopause\n[e.g., Mann et al., 1999]. However, experimental evidence\nfor plasmatrough cavity\/waveguide modes remains sparse\n[e.g., Waters et al., 2002].\n[4] In understanding observations of field line oscilla-\ntions, a knowledge of the expected eigenperiods of the field\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, A11206, doi:10.1029\/2004JA010964, 2005\n1Now at Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, UK.\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2004JA010964$09.00\nA11206 1 of 10\nlines as a function of magnetic latitude, local time, and\nseason is clearly of vital importance.

[1969] and Sinha and\nRajaram [1997], for both the toroidal and polodial modes\nof oscillation. In such calculations a hydrogen plasma is\nassumed. At low and equatorial latitudes, where heavier\nspecies such as oxygen and helium take over, similar\ncalculations have been presented by Poulter et al. [1988].\nAt high latitudes, deviations from a dipolar field become\nsignificant. Such complexities in the field geometry prevent\nan analytical treatment of the eigenperiods, and this problem\nwas addressed via a simple time-of-flight approach by\nWarner and Orr [1979]. Warner and Orr [1979] used the\nMead and Fairfield [1975] model of the terrestrial magnetic\nfield, which allowed calculations of field line eigenperiods\nup to latitudes of \u000175\u0001 (\u000168\u0001) in the noon (midnight) sector\nand also allowed the effects of magnetic activity and dipole\ntilt to be investigated. The Warner and Orr [1979] time-of-\nflight approach to eigenmode calculations at high latitude\nhas been used extensively in the interpretation of ULF wave\nobservations. Their results were invoked in the interpreta-\ntion of early results from auroral zone and subauroral VHF\ncoherent radar measurements of ULF waves [e.g., Villain,\n1982; Yeoman and Lester, 1990]. The results have also\nprovided a baseline for the explanation of the local time\nvariations of magnetic field oscillations at Pc5 frequencies\nobserved in ground-based data [Yumoto and Saito, 1983;\nGlassmeier and Stellmacher, 2000]. The technique has been\nequally important in the interpretation of the observed\nperiods in ground-based data at very high magnetic latitudes\nnear the cusp region [Ables et al., 1988; Waters et al., 1995;\nClauer et al., 1997] and similarly in high-latitude spacecraft\nobservations out to L shells up to L = 9 [e.g., Anderson et\nal., 1989, 1990]. In addition to these experimental studies,\nthe modeling of Warner and Orr [1979] has also been used\nto provide baseline eigenfrequencies for ULF wave model-\ning efforts in realistic geometries [e.g., Allan et al., 1986;\nLee and Lysak, 1990; Wright, 1992].\n[5] The eigenfrequencies of ULF waves provide an\nimportant diagnostic of the plasma loading along the field\nline, both within the plasmasphere and the plasmatrough\n[e.g., Poulter et al., 1984; Waters et al., 1996; Loto\u2019aniu et\nal., 1999; Dent et al., 2003]. At higher latitudes the\ninterpretation of such data in terms of plasma loading\nclearly requires a realistic model of the magnetic field\ngeometry as a prerequisite for any accurate inference of\nthe plasma density.\n[6] Since the original calculations of Warner and Orr\n[1979], great advances have been made in magnetic field\nmodeling, and the limitations of the Mead and Fairfield\n[1975] model have become clear. The location of the open\/\nclosed field line boundary and magnetic field stretching in\nthe midnight sector are two particularly clear instances\nwhere the Mead and Fairfield [1975] model requires\nupdating. Recently, Rankin et al. [2000] solved the funda-\nmental eigenmode equations under the magnetic field ge-\nometry of the Tsyganenko [1996] magnetic field model\n[Tsyganenko, 1995, 1996] in the midnight sector, demon-\nstrating that frequencies could result which were an order of\nmagnitude lower than those expected for a dipole field.\nHere we present a refinement of the simpler time-of-flight\napproximation of Warner and Orr [1979], based upon the\nTsyganenko [1996] magnetic field model in order to explore\nsuch effects under a wide variety of latitude, local time,\ndipole tilt, and magnetic activity conditions.\n2. Models\n[7] Approximating the oscillations on terrestrial field\nlines as Alfve\u00b4n waves standing on individual field lines,\nthe period of oscillation, t, can be approximated by the\ntime-of-flight approximation\nt \u00bc 2\nZ\nds\nVA\n; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere VA is the Alfve\u00b4n velocity, and the integration is carried\nout over the entire length of the field line. TheAlfve\u00b4n speed at\nsome position on the field lines is described by\nV 2A \u00bc\nB2\nm0r\n; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere B and r denote the local magnetic field strength and\nplasma density, respectively. Therefore in order to calculate\nthe period of an Alfve\u00b4nic oscillation on a terrestrial field line,\nit is necessary to employ realistic descriptions of the\nmagnetospheric magnetic field and plasma environment.\n2.1. Magnetic Field Model\n[8] For the purposes of this investigation, we have\nimplemented the Tsyganenko [1996] magnetic field model\n[Tsyganenko, 1995, 1996], hereafter referred to as the\n\u2018\u2018T96\u2019\u2019 model. This model has several significant advan-\ntages over the magnetospheric field model of Mead and\nFairfield [1975] employed by Warner and Orr [1979]. Most\nimportantly for the current study, the T96 model describes\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetotail much more realistically than that of\nMead and Fairfield [1975] which extended to only 17 RE\ndownstream of the planet. Furthermore, the magnetic field\ndescribed by the T96 model is derived from several modular\nelements representing magnetic field sources within the\nmagnetopause current system, the ring current, the cross-\ntail current sheet, and Region 1 and 2 Birkeland current\nsystems, in addition to the Earth\u2019s internal field. As such the\nT96 model contains none of the built-in dawn-dusk and\nnorth-south symmetries found within the earlier model and\nallows for a more realistic description of local time effects.\nAn additional key difference between the field models of\nTsyganenko [1995, 1996] and Mead and Fairfield [1975] is\nthat the former is parameterized by the Dst index, the solar\nwind dynamic pressure, and the BY and BZ components of\nthe IMF incident upon the magnetopause, whereas the latter\nrelies only upon a crude parameterization by the KP index.\n2.2. Plasma Model\n[9] In order to investigate the implementation of a more\nrealistic magnetospheric magnetic field model upon the\nresults of Warner and Orr [1979], we have retained the\nplasma density model utilized in that study. This model,\nbased upon data reviewed by Chappell [1972], is summa-\nrized in Table 1. The in situ magnetospheric plasma densi-\nA11206 WILD ET AL.: HIGH-LATITUDE GEOMAGNETIC PULSATIONS\n2 of 10\nA11206\nties are drawn from OGO 5 mass spectrometer measure-\nments during 1968\u20131969. The distribution of magneto-\nspheric plasma along individual field lines at distances\ngreater than 2 RE can then be represented as proportional\nto r\u0005n, with the exact value of n depending upon the chosen\nregion of the magnetosphere We have departed from this is\nin only two regards. First, the description of the plasma\ndensity within the plasmatrough given by Warner and Orr\n[1979], which is local time dependant due to filling from the\nionosphere during the day, is insufficiently detailed to allow\nfull implementation in this model. We have therefore\nreverted to the plasmatrough plasma density distribution\npredicted by Chappell et al. [1971] assuming a constant\nupward flux of 3 \u0006 108 ions cm\u00052 s\u00051 with a collisionless\ndistribution of ionization along the field line. Second, due to\nthe extended tail of the T96 model, compared to that of\nMead and Fairfield [1975], it has been necessary to\nintroduce a minimum magnetospheric plasma density in\norder to avoid excessively large Alfve\u00b4n speeds in the distant\ntail. For this study, we have therefore set the minimum\nplasma number density to be 0.01 ions cm\u00053.\n3. Results\n[10] Figure 1 presents an overview of the estimated\nvariation in Alfve\u00b4n pulsation period as a function of\ngeomagnetic latitude under a variety of conditions. In order\nto gauge the accuracy of the time-of-flight method\nemployed in this study, we compare the results with those\nfrom a numerical solution to the wave equations approach\nunder identical geomagnetic conditions.

[1981] to the T96 model (dashed\nline). The wave equation described by Singer et al. [1981]\nwas numerically solved using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta\nalgorithm as described by Waters et al. [1995]. In order to\nnumerically solve the Singer equation, it is necessary to\ncompute the geometry of adjacent field lines to obtain the\nha parameter. At high latitudes, the field tracing for one\nfield line may track to the opposite hemisphere, while the\nother tracks an open field line. Furthermore, the separation\nbetween adjacent field lines can become large along some\nsections with questionable results from the numerical inte-\ngration. Any results that exhibited field tracing difficulties\nwere rejected.\n[11] In each panel of Figure 1, the plasma model\nemployed is identical in order to emphasize the variations\ndue to differing magnetic field configurations. More specif-\nically, we have defined the plasma density at L = 4 to be\n100 ions cm\u00053, decreasing with radial distance in the\nequatorial plane with a r\u00054 dependence. In all panels, three\nof the four T96 input parameters remain constant (Dst =\n0 nT, IMF BY = IMF BZ = 0 nT).\n[12] Figure 1a corresponds to the pulsation period in the\n0200 MLT magnetic meridian under spring equinox con-\nditions (equivalent to 0\u0001 dipole tilt) with the solar wind\ndynamic pressure (PSW) set at 2 nPa. In this configuration,\nthe time-of-flight (solid line) and Singer et al. [1981]\n(dashed line) estimates of field line eigenfrequency are in\nalmost exact agreement in the region where both are\ncalculated. Furthermore, both approaches based upon the\nT96 model estimate the eigenperiod to be significantly (in\nexcess of 300%) larger than the time-of-flight estimate for a\ndipolar field geometry (dotted line). This is as expected\ngiven that the dipolar magnetic field is a wholly unrealistic\ndescription of the midlatitude\/high-latitude magnetic field\ngeometry in the magnetotail.\n[13] Figure 1b corresponds to the 1200 MLT (noon)\nmeridian at northern hemisphere summer solstice (equiva-\nlent to \u000134\u0001 dipole tilt) with PSW = 6 nPa, while Figure 1c\ncorresponds to the 0800 MLT magnetic meridian under\nwinter solstice conditions (equivalent to \u0001\u000534\u0001 dipole tilt)\nwith PSW = 1 nPa. In both cases, the agreement between the\ntwo approaches is generally excellent at magnetic latitudes\nequatorward of \u000170\u0001 Mlat (the numerically calculated\nfigure being \u000175% of the time-of-flight equivalent). At\nlatitudes poleward of this, the difference between the values\nincreases (the equivalent comparison being \u000165% in\nFigure 1b at 75\u0001 \u0001 Mlat). However, we note that in the\ncase of Figure 1b, the estimates then converge at \u000178\u0001.\nTherefore the time-of-flight approach (when applied to the\nT96 model field) yields estimates that are broadly in\nagreement with the Singer et al. [1981] numerical tech-\nnique. While at very high latitudes (poleward of \u000175\u0001 Mlat)\nthe difference between the two estimates may be significant\n(\u0001several tens of percent), it is difficult to determine which\ntechnique is the most accurate. Given that the time-of-flight\napproach allows the rapid investigation of Alfve\u00b4n pulsations\nover a larger range of latitudes than the Singer et al. [1981]\ntechnique (subject of course to the accuracy of the magnetic\nfield model employed), we shall use it to investigate the\nlatitudinal, diiurnal, seasonal variations in the frequency\/\nperiod of Alfve\u00b4nic pulsations on geomagnetic field lines. In\nthe final section our estimates will be compared to field line\noscillations presented in investigations by other authors.\n3.1. Variation of Period With Latitude\n[14] Figures 2a, 2b, and 2c present the latitudinal varia-\ntions in Alfve\u00b4n pulsation period under equinox conditions\nbetween 57\u0001\u201380\u0001 magnetic latitude along the 0800 MLT,\n1600 MLT, and 0000 MLT magnetic meridians, respectively.\nIn all cases the T96 input parameters were set to PSW =\n2 nPa, Dst = 0 nT, IMF BY and IMF BZ = 0 nT such that the\nconfiguration of the magnetospheric field remained con-\nstant. In each panel the results of time-of-flight analysis for\nthe plasma regions listed in Table 1 are presented.\n[15] As expected, the characteristic period of Alfve\u00b4nic\nmicropulsations generally increases with magnetic latitude\nin all local time sectors, irrespective of the plasma distri-\nbution selected. Figure 2a is broadly consistent with previ-\nous results under similar geomagnetic conditions. However,\nour calculations improve upon those of Warner and Orr\n[1979] in several regards. Most significantly, the more\nrealistic magnetic field model employed allows us to extend\nour time-of-flight calculations to magnetic field lines that\noriginate at higher latitudes. For example, we note that in\nthis local time sector, the calculations of Warner and Orr\n[1979] were limited to magnetic latitudes <73\u0001. Comparison\nof Figures 2a and 2b reveals slight differences between the\npostdawn and predusk sectors (in addition to the extra dusk\nplasmasphere trace), the consequence of local time asym-\nmetries contained within the T96 magnetic field model but\nomitted from the Mead and Fairfield [1975] model\nemployed by Warner and Orr [1979]. Furthermore, merid-\nional latitude-period profiles originating from the southern\nhemisphere (not shown) indicate small north-south asym-\nmetries, also not included in the Mead and Fairfield [1975]\nmodel.\n[16] The final latitude-period profile presented here cor-\nresponds to the midnight meridian (Figure 2c). These\nprofiles represents a significant departure from the estimated\npulsation period-latitude relationships proposed by Warner\nand Orr [1979] due to the extended nature of the magneto-\ntail described by the T96 model. While the Mead and\nFairfield [1975] model was valid only within 17 RE of the\nEarth, the equatorial crossing points of field lines in the\nmidnight sector are predicted to be located much further\ndown tail at latitudes poleward of \u000168\u0001 Mlat. For the\npurposes of this investigation, we have designated any\nmagnetic field lines that extend further than 300 RE from\nthe Earth as \u2018\u2018open.\u2019\u2019 The local maximum in each latitude-\nperiod profile (located at \u000168\u0001 Mlat) is the result of the\nrapidly increasing field line length at increasingly northward\npositions on the midnight meridian. This effect, a conse-\nquence of T96 model configuration, is indicated in\nFigure 2c: the variation of field line length in the midnight\nsector, plotted as a function of magnetic latitude, is indicated\nby the dashed line, according to the scale on the right-hand\naxis. This effect is limited in azimuth to approximately\n\u00b12 hours MLT either side of midnight.\n3.2. Variation of Period With MLT\n[17] Figure 3 indicates the variations in micropuslation\nperiod for the different plasma regions at equinox as a\nfunction of MLT at 68\u0001 (Figure 3a), 72\u0001 (Figure 3b), and 76\u0001\nA11206 WILD ET AL.: HIGH-LATITUDE GEOMAGNETIC PULSATIONS\n4 of 10\nA11206\n(Figure 3c) Mlat. As in previous cases, the T96 input\nparameters were set to PSW = 2 nPa, Dst = 0 nT, IMF BY =\nIMF BZ = 0 nT. The results shown in Figure 3a are\nconsistent with those presented by Warner and Orr\n[1979]. In the extended plasmasphere, dusk plasmasphere,\nFigure 3.

The radial\ndisplacement of the equatorial crossing point of magnetic\nfield lines are indicated in each case. In Figure 2c the\nvariation of magnetic field line length in the midnight sector\ndescribed by the T96 model is also plotted as a function of\nmagnetic latitude under equinox conditions (dashed line).\nA11206 WILD ET AL.: HIGH-LATITUDE GEOMAGNETIC PULSATIONS\n5 of 10\nA11206\nand detached plasma regions, no local time dependencies\nare included in the model plasma distributions. As such, the\nprofiles are influenced mainly by the changing shape of the\nfield lines at this latitude. Each therefore exhibits a charac-\nteristic u-shaped profile, with the minimum period being\nlocated at noon, where the field lines are shortest and\nthe field strength strongest. For clarity, the profiles\ncorresponding to the dusk plasmasphere, detached plasma,\nand plasmatrough models are only plotted over a physically\nreasonable range of local times. We note that between noon\nand midnight local times, the equatorial crossing point of\nthe 68\u0001 Mlat field line varies by \u00016 RE. This contrasts with\nthe \u00012 RE variation predicted by the Mead and Fairfield\n[1975] magnetic field model. Therefore the correspondence\nbetween these results and those of Warner and Orr [1979],\nalthough excellent at all local times, is closest in the noon\nsector, where the magnetic field models used in each case\nare most alike.\n[18] Unlike the other plasma regions, the density distri-\nbution model employed for the plasmatrough is inherently\ndependent upon local time. The estimated period-MLT\nprofile for this region is therefore markedly different. In\nthis case the plasma density variations at different local\ntimes are more significant than the change in the length\nand shape of the 68\u0001 Mlat field line. The pulsation period\nis lowest in the predawn sector (when the plasma in\nthe trough is relatively rarefied) and highest in the\npostdusk sector (when the plasma density within the\ntrough has been enhanced due to filling from the dayside\nionosphere).\n[19] Figures 3b and 3c present corresponding period-\nMLT profiles at 72\u0001 and 76\u0001 Mlat, respectively. In each\ncase the period-MLT curves have been systematically\nshifted upward due to the increasing lengths of field lines\nat higher latitudes. As indicated by the equatorial crossing\npoints of field lines at these higher latitudes, Alfve\u00b4nic\nmicropulsations travel significantly greater radial distances\nfrom the Earth than considered by Warner and Orr [1979].\nNote also the slight local maximum in pulsation period in\nthe postnoon sector (\u00011400 MLT) at the highest latitude\n(Figure 3c).\n3.3. Variation of Period With Season\/Dipole Tilt\n[20] Figure 4 presents identical period-MLT profiles as\nthose shown in Figure 3, except the calculations have\nbeen made under northern hemisphere summer solstice\nconditions rather than an equinox configuration (i.e.,\n\u000134\u0001 dipole tilt angle rather than 0\u0001). The T96 model\nsolar wind and IMF parameterization remains unchanged.\nIt is immediately apparent that the overall trends are\ngenerally unaffected by this change, although detailed\nexamination reveals some small differences. Essentially,\nat solstice the pulsation period is reduced slightly in the\ndaytime and increased during the nighttime. This is a\nconsequence of the slight compression of the dayside\nmagnetosphere as the pole tilts toward the Sun. The\nreduced field line length and enhanced field strength\ncombined to increase the propagation speed of Alfve\u00b4n\npulsation, thus reducing the pulsation period. In the tail\nthe opposite effect occurs the field lines being drawn\nfurther out downstream in the T96 model. The increase in\ntail field line length and reduction of the tail field\nstrength (which reduces the Alfve\u00b4n speed) results in\nincreased pulsation periods. As was the case at equinox\n(Figure 3c), we note that at the highest latitude presented\n(76\u0001 Mlat), there is local maximum in the predicted\noscillation period, although at solstice it is much more\npronounced and centered at noon.\n3.4. Variation of Period With Solar Wind and\nIMF Conditions\n[21] Finally, we present the impact of different solar wind\nand IMF parameterization of the T96 model on Alfve\u00b4n\npulsation time of flight estimates. Figure 5 presents\nFigure 4. The variation of pulsation period as a function\nof magnetic local time under northern hemisphere summer\nsolstice conditions for terrestrial field lines at (a) 68\u0001,\n(b) 72\u0001, and (c) 76\u0001 Mlat.\nA11206 WILD ET AL.: HIGH-LATITUDE GEOMAGNETIC PULSATIONS\n6 of 10\nA11206\nfrequency-MLT profiles for pulsations on the 72\u0001 Mlat field\nline under equinox conditions. In this figure a magneto-\nspheric plasma density of 1 ion cm\u00053 at 4 RE has been\nassumed. This enables the pulsation frequency to be scaled\nfor any plasma number density by the relation f = f0(n)\n\u00051\n2,\nwhere f0 is the frequency read from the figure and n the\ndesired number density at 4 RE in units of cm\n\u00053. The panels\ndemonstrate the effects of adjusting the input parameters to\nthe T96 model, namely PSW (Figure 5a), Dst (Figure 5b),\nand the IMF clock angle, defined as arctan(BY\/BZ)\n(Figure 5c).\n[22] The effects of an increase in the solar wind dynamic\npressure (Figure 5a) are broadly as expected. As PSW is\nincreased from 2 to 10 nPa, the overall compression of the\nmagnetosphere increases the pulsation frequency (reduces\nthe pulsation period) at all local times and for all plasma\ndensity distributions. This effect is most significant between\n0400 and 2000 MLT and is a consequence of (1) the\ngenerally reduced length of magnetospheric field lines and\n(2) the increased magnetic field strength in the compressed\nmagnetospheric cavity resulting in faster pulsation propa-\ngation. We also note that in the midnight sector, field lines\nmapping to 72\u0001 Mlat are \u2018\u2018open\u2019\u2019 and therefore incapable of\nsupporting standing waves.\n[23] At most magnetic local times (0300\u20132100 MLT), the\npulsation frequency tends to decrease as a function of\n(negatively) increasing Dst index (Figure 5b). This is as\nexpected since the increasing magnitude of this input\nparameter is effectively increasing the strength of the ring\ncurrent, resulting in a depressed geomagnetic field. The\nAlfve\u00b4n speed in the inner magnetosphere is therefore also\ndecreased, increasing the pulsation period and decreasing\nthe frequency. In the night time sector, especially around\nmidnight, the traced field lines extend far in the tail and are\ntherefore less sensitive to changes in the Dst parameter.\n[24] The rotation of the a fixed magnitude IMF (jBj =\n8 nT) about the Sun-Earth line, resulting in IMF clock\nangles between 0\u0001 and 180\u0001, dramatically alters the period-\nMLT profiles (Figure 5c). The approximate symmetry about\nthe noon evident in previous figures was a consequence of\nthe roughly symmetrical magnetic field configuration of the\nT96 magnetospheric field model with null IMF input\nparameterization (note that this is in contrast to the dawn-\ndusk symmetry built-in to the magnetic field model ofMead\nand Fairfield [1975] employed by Warner and Orr [1979]).\nHowever, as the IMF clock angle is rotated from northward\npointing to southward, significant asymmetries are intro-\nduced into the magnetospheric configuration. The newly\nintroduced asymmetry is characterized by a local minimum\nin the oscillation period that migrates from the morning to\nthe afternoon sector as the IMF evolves from a northward to\na southward orientation (via duskward). This is most likely\nan effect of the reconfiguration of the dayside magneto-\nsphere due to the IMF-controlled interconnection of geo-\nmagnetic and solar wind magnetic fields across the\nmagnetopause boundary (a feature of the T96 model not\nfound in other data-based representations).\n[25] Figure 6 presents the variations in pulsation fre-\nquency as a function of magnetic latitude along two\nmagnetic local time meridians (0600 MLT: Figures 6a\u20136c\nand 1200 MLT: Figures 6d\u20136f). At each MLT, the three\npanels indicate the effect of varying the T96 input param-\neters exactly as in Figure 5. The same plasma density of\n1 ion cm\u00053 at 4 RE has also been retained. As such Figure 6\npresents the latitudinal profile equivalent of the MLT\nprofiles presented in Figure 5.\n[26] As expected, we note that the variations in PSW\nresult in moderate (\u000120%) frequency variations across\nthe range of latitudes presented. The same is true for\nvariations in the IMF clock angle, although in this case,\nthe frequency variations are clearly more significant\nFigure 5. The results of varying the T96 input parameters\nwhen calculating the frequency of Alfve\u00b4n pulsations\nstanding on the 72\u0001 Mlat magnetic field line under equinox\nconditions.\nA11206 WILD ET AL.: HIGH-LATITUDE GEOMAGNETIC PULSATIONS\n7 of 10\nA11206\nin the noon sector (Figure 6f) than in the dawn sector\n(Figure 6c) especially at \u000170\u0001\u201375\u0001 Mlat. Some of the\nmost significant effects on pulsation frequency are due to\nchanges in the Dst parameter (Figures 6b and 6e). At\nmidlatitudes (57\u0001\u201365\u0001), adjustments to the Dst input\nparameter result in large variations in the estimated\npulsation frequency (approaching a factor of 2 in some\ncases). Once again we note that this is a result of the\nincreased magnetic field strength within the inner portion\nof the T96 magnetosphere due to the enhanced ring\ncurrent.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\n[27] The results presented above lead us to several clear\nconclusions. First, they validate the earlier results of Warner\nand Orr [1979]. We have, by utilizing an alternative\nmagnetospheric magnetic field model, been able to broadly\nFigure 6.

Each panel indicates the effect of various input parameters upon the\ncalculated pulsation frequency, as described in the text.\nA11206 WILD ET AL.: HIGH-LATITUDE GEOMAGNETIC PULSATIONS\n8 of 10\nA11206\nreproduce the latitude-period and period-MLT profiles pre-\nsented in that study. Second, while our finding are consis-\ntent with those of Warner and Orr [1979], we have\nextended our results to higher magnetic latitudes. Third,\nwe have confirmed that upstream interplanetary conditions\nexert a powerful influence upon the period of Alfve\u00b4nic\npulsations in the magnetosphere.\n[28] The first two conclusion are a consequence of the\nmore realistic description of the magnetospheric magnetic\nfield provided by the T96 model. The accurate representa-\ntion of the extended magnetotail has enabled us to perform\ntime-of-flight calculations at high latitudes, even in the\nmidnight sector, with relative confidence.\n[29] Perhaps more important though are the effects of the\nIMF orientation upon pulsation period in the dayside\nmagnetosphere. For example, note the changes to morn-\ning\/afternoon sector pulsation frequencies indicated in\nFigure 5c. This is in stark contrast to the period-MLT\nvariations with null IMF parameterization (e.g., Figure 3b).\n[30] Of course, the true test of this analysis technique is\nthe comparison with observed ULF field-line oscillations.\nFigure 7 presents such a comparison. Figure 7a shows quiet-\ntime magnetic field line resonance frequencies as a function\nof L value for the interval 0700\u20130800 UT on 1 January\n1998, as presented by Menk et al. [2004]. These frequencies\nwere determined via the twin-station cross-phase analysis\n(filled circles) and single-station power ratio analysis (un-\nfilled circles) of data from the SAMNET and IMAGE\nground-magnetometer networks located in the Scandinavian\nsector. Overlaid on these data are frequency-L shell profiles\ndetermined from the time-of-flight technique using T96\n(dashed line) and dipolar (solid line) magnetic field geom-\netries. In this case a plasma number density of 300 ions cm\u00053\nand a r\u00054 density variation was assumed. We note an\nencouraging systematic agreement between the observed\nfrequencies and those estimated via the time-of-flight anal-\nysis. At the highest L values (latitudes), we note that the\ncalculation underestimates the observed pulsation frequency\nby 25%. Given an identical plasma distribution, the T96\ntime-of-flight estimate is clearly superior the dipole field\nequivalent in the region poleward of L = 6.\n[31] Figure 7b presents the diurnal variation of the Alfve\u00b4n\npulsation continuum (solid lines) derived via cross-phase\nanalysis for three station pairs of the IMAGE ground\nmagnetometer array, as presented by Mathie et al. [1999].\nThe symbols indicate the station pair used according to the\nkey. Eigenfrequencies derived via the T96 time-of-flight\ntechnique are overlaid at the appropriate latitude (dotted\nlines). Once again, we note a generally good agreement\nbetween the estimated and observed frequencies. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, the agreement between the two improves at\nincreasing latitudes (where one might expect to be less\nconfident in the modeled magnetic field geometry). This\nsuggests that the discrepancy between predicted and ob-\nserved pulsation frequency at the OUJ\u2013PEL pair between\n0600 and 1200 MLT is due to the inadequacy of the selected\nplasma model at midlatitudes in this MLT sector. It is\ndifficult to account for the large changes in the observed\nfrequency purely in terms of the variability of the magnetic\nfield. It therefore seems likely that in this MLT\/Mlat region,\nthe magnetospheric plasma density has been significantly\noverestimated.\n[32] This paper has demonstrated that the time-of-flight\ntechnique, combined with the T96 magnetic field model\nprovides a useful method by which the eigenfrequency of\ngeomagnetic field lines may be estimated. Although sim-\nplistic, this approach allows the investigation of highly\nstretched, asymmetric magnetospheric field lines for which\nno general analytical eigenmode calculations are available.\nThe highly configurable nature of the technique described\nabove, especially in terms of the dependency on universal\ntime and upstream interplanetary conditions, permit the\ncreation of bespoke time-dependent ULF pulsation period\nestimates for any chosen spacecraft or ground station,\nparameterized by realistic upstream interplanetary condi-\nFigure 7.

Comparison such as these will form the basis of future\nstudies. In addition, a significant evolution of the analysis\npresented will arise from the implementation of a more\nrealistic plasma density model, most likely derived from a\nrecent magnetospheric satellite mission (such as Cluster or\nDouble Star). We anticipate this to be a direction of future\ninvestigation also.\n[33] Acknowledgments.
