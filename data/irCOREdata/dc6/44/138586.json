Introduction  \n \nToday the manufacturing world is facing major pressures due to the globalisation of \nmarkets. Internal and external organisational pressures have led to increased \ncompetition, market complexity, and new customer demands. It has been noted how \norganisations adopt lean or agile manufacturing strategies to overcome this problem [1]. \nThese strategies have different approaches and elements to address in the design of the \nmanufacturing system, but they all depend on two common things: acquiring \ntechnology and the effective operation of this technology by humans.  \n \nDevelopments in computer-integrated manufacturing systems and the methods by which \nthey are designed have induced firms to shift their emphasis towards human factors, \nparticularly man-machine interaction, and to consider people as assets instead of costs. \n In the manufacturing systems design literature, emphasis is directed towards producing \na coherent interaction between technology, organisation, and people to overcome new \ncompetitive challenges. Various authors have pointed out the importance of addressing \nhuman factors generally in the evaluation and design of manufacturing systems, calling \nspecifically for the adoption of a balanced method based on technology, organisation, \nand people [2,3,4].  \n \nFurthermore, the literature on investment evaluation is continuously being updated to \naccommodate the new market demands and manufacturing technology [5]. The changes \nin the market environment and justification of new manufacturing technologies have \ncaused management to shift away from relying on traditional economic justification to \nthe incorporation of intangible benefits and organisational strategy [6]. However, there \ncontinue to be reports of investment failures and difficulties in computer-integrated \nmanufacturing systems implementation, due to the lack of addressing man-machine \ninteraction appropriately [2,7].  \n \nMoreover, an investigation into human factors and manufacturing automation clearly \nillustrated that despite managers\u2019 interest in having a balanced consideration of both \ntechnology and humans in the planning and designing of their manufacturing system, \nand their efforts in placing more emphasis on the importance of human elements in the \nmanufacturing environment; in practice they were still not appropriately considering \nman-machine interaction in their manufacturing automation decision-making [8].  In \naddition, it was noticed that management needed to be supported in improving man-\nmachine interaction at the earliest stage of their manufacturing automation decision-\nmaking process, in order for them to avoid the pitfalls of over-automation which can \nlead to the failure of computer-integrated manufacturing systems to deliver cost \neffective and flexible operations.  \n \nIn an attempt to respond to this, a decision tool for the integration of technology, \norganisation and people during the automation decision-making process has been \ndeveloped. The decision tool uses the QFD technique to link management\u2019s automation \ninvestment objectives with technology, organisation, and people evaluation to determine \n the best alternative. Thereafter, the FMEA technique is deployed to draw attention to \nany problems that might be associated with that option in terms of design and \nimplementation.  \nThis paper describes the approach and the results of an evaluation in industry. It is \norganised into five sections. Section 2 contains a general view of the developed method \nwhile Section 3 describes the technique in detail; the methodology is applied in a real \ncase in Section 4 followed by a discussion in Section 5 and conclusions in Section 6. \n \n2. The Approach \n \nThe consideration of technology, organisation, and people issues in manufacturing \nautomation investment is an activity that requires the evaluation of both tangible and \nintangible elements. The QFD method not only allows the consideration of both \ntangible and intangible elements, but also the identification of the importance of each of \nthese elements in the decision. However, there are situations when taking a decision \ncould result in accepting some trade-offs, and it becomes an obstacle for managers to \nrevisit and plan for them in the implementation stage. Therefore, an extra technique \n(FMEA) was appended to highlight any related trade-offs or areas of concern for \nimplementation review. \n \nRather than the traditional investment justification process, the proposed methodology \nuses the QFD technique as the prime method to link the automation investment \nobjectives with technology, organisation and people evaluation for the selection of the \nbest alternative. Subsequently, the decision is fed into the FMEA technique to highlight \nthe related potential problems associated with it. The combination of the QFD and \nFMEA techniques shown in Figure 1 represents an outline of the developed \nmethodology concept. \n \n2.1. Quality Function Deployment Review \n \nThe Quality Function Deployment (QFD) technique is a systematic procedure for \ndefining customer needs and interpreting them in terms of product features and process \n characteristics. The systematic analysis helps developers avoid rushed decisions that fail \nto take the entire product and all the customer needs into account [9]. It is a process that \ninvolves constructing one or a set of interlinked matrices, known as \u2018quality tables\u2019. The \nfirst of these matrices is called the \u201cHouse of Quality\u201d (HOQ). The house of quality \nmatrix has two principal parts; the horizontal part, which contains information relevant \nto the customer, and the vertical part, which contains corresponding technical \ntranslation of their needs [10]. The basic process underlying QFD resides in the centre \nof the matrix where the customer and technical parts intersect, providing an opportunity \nto examine each customer\u2019s voice versus each technical requirement, for a detailed \ndescription of QFD formation process [9].  \n \nThe proposed methodology uses this concept to capture the automation investment \nobjectives and link them with technology, organisation, and people evaluation criteria \nfor the selection of the best alternative. Therefore, in this methodology rather than \nlisting the design requirements along the top portion of the HOQ matrix the automation \ninvestment evaluation criteria are listed. The relationship examination allows \nmanagement to examine each automation investment objective against the evaluation \ncriteria, as well as identifying the importance of each evaluation criterion. Thereafter, a \nsecond house is used to identify the most appropriate automation alternative. Therefore, \nrather than listing the part\/subsystem requirements along the top portion of the second \nmatrix the automation alternatives are listed.  The relationship examination allows \nmanagement to examine each automation alternative against the evaluation criteria \n(input from HOQ) to identify the most appropriate option.    \n \nHowever, as in any evaluation process, there are situations in which making a decision \ninvolves trade-offs to reach a satisfactory outcome, and it becomes necessary for \nmanagers to revisit these trade-off decisions in the implementation stage. Therefore, \ninterlinking the QFD with the FMEA technique was felt to be necessary to highlight any \nrelated trade-offs or areas of concern which might require a review of the design and \nimplementation. \n \n \n  \n2.2. Failure Mode Effects Analysis Review \n \nFailure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a disciplined approach used to identify \npotential failures of a product or service and then determine the frequency and impact of \nthe failure. It is an approach that is often referred to as a \u201cbottom up\u201d approach, as it \nfunctions by means of the identification of a particular cause or failure mode within a \nsystem in a fashion that traces forward the logical sequence of this condition through \nthe system to the final effects [11]. The main idea is to generate a risk priority number \n(RPN) for each failure mode. The higher the risk number, the more serious the failure \ncould be, and the more important it is that this failure mode be addressed. For a detailed \ndescription of the FMEA creation process, see [11]. \n \nThe proposed methodology uses this approach to identify the risks associated with the \nbest alternative selected to avoid unforeseen problems following the installation and \noperation stages. Therefore, rather than the standard application for identifying potential \nproduct failures and preventing them, it is applied to support management in identifying \npotential problems with the selected alternative and preventing them. In addition, \nestablishing the risk priority numbers allows management to determine the importance \nof addressing potentially troublesome areas for recommendations and future review. \n \n2.3. Development of the Decision Tool \n \nIn order to deploy the QFD and FMEA techniques in the proposed structure, certain \nmodifications were necessary. The techniques are deployed in a non-product \napplication, specifically, in automated manufacturing systems selection and risk \nassessment processes. Therefore, certain parts from the basic structure had to be either \nrenamed or omitted.  \nThe House of Quality correlations matrix, the planning matrix and the technical & target \nanalysis parts were not deployed in this methodology; as such investigations were not \nconsidered relevant for this decision-making process. In addition, two major steps were \nremoved from the basic FMEA application to enable this technique to be applied in a \n non-product context. These steps were \u2018assigning detection ratings\u2019 and \u2018calculation of \nnew risk priority numbers\u2019, both of which were felt to be much less relevant outside the \nproduct design context [13].  \nThe modifications were conducted after a literature review of both QFD and FMEA \nnon-product applications demonstrated feasibility of carrying out these alterations \n[5,12,13]. \n \nMoreover, what is essential besides the mechanism process was to determine the \nevaluation criteria and sub-evaluation criteria against which the manufacturing \nautomation options will be evaluated. The process of identifying the evaluation criteria \nand sub-evaluation criteria involved compiling a list of the elements that could be \nrelated to technology, organisation, and people in manufacturing systems selection and \ndesign literature. In addition, both the evaluation criteria and sub-evaluation criteria \nwere assessed against predetermined criteria to enable a robust selection process. The \nselection process was carried out through a screening process using the following three \ncriteria:  \n \n1 General relevance: evidence that both the evaluation criteria and sub-evaluation \ncriteria are related to manufacturing systems selection or design process.  \n2 Specific relevance: evidence that both the evaluation criteria and sub-evaluation \ncriteria specifically relates to either the evaluation or the implementation \nprocess. \n3 Credibility: a minimum of three sources must agree that each criterion is an \nessential factor to consider in manufacturing systems evaluation or successful \nimplementation process. However, for the sub-evaluation criteria a minimum of \nthree sources must indicate that it is an essential factor in addressing each \ncriterion.   \n \n3. The Decision-Making Framework \n \nThe proposed concept involves constructing a joint QFD and FMEA model. Both \ntechniques are used to support the manufacturing automation decision-making process. \n Consequently, they need to be incorporated into a framework and a layout which is \ndeveloped specifically for this purpose. In this framework the QFD process involves \ncreating two interlinked matrices. The first matrix starts with the management and their \nneeds and relates their needs to system evaluation criteria. The second matrix follows \nthrough the evaluation criteria (inputs) and magnifies them into sub-evaluation criteria \nfor selection of the best alternative (outputs). The selected alternative evaluation data is \nthen fed into the FMEA to conduct a risk assessment, as shown in Figure 2. \n \nStage 1: Linking Automation Investment Objectives with Evaluation Criteria \nThe purpose of the first stage is to determine the importance of the evaluation criteria in \nrelation to management\u2019s needs. The user gathers and prioritises the automation \ninvestment objectives from the stakeholders involved in the investment. The user then \nenters the data into the QFD matrix to establish relationships between the needs and the \nevaluation criteria. The matrix computation will enable the user to realise how much \ninfluence each evaluation criterion will have on the decision-making process, as shown \nin Figure 3. \n \nStage 2: Automation Alternative Selection \nThe purpose of the second stage is to identify the best alternative. In this stage the \nresults are transformed from the first QFD matrix to the second matrix to drive the sub-\nevaluation criteria importance ranking. The second matrix computation will enable the \nuser to evaluate the alternative options against the sub-evaluation criteria, in order to \nidentify the most suitable option, as shown in Figure 4.  \n \nStage 3: Decision Assessment \nThe purpose of the third stage is to identify the risks associated with the best alternative. \nIn this stage the best alternative evaluation data from the second QFD matrix is \ntransferred to the FMEA worksheet to indicate any potential problems. Any negative \nscores within the data are used to highlight the potentially troublesome areas for special \nattention, as shown in Table 1. The outcome from this final stage is represented by a set \nof normalised risk priority numbers (RPN) for each element calculated from the \naverages of the RPNs for each associated sub-element. These, in turn, have been \n calculated for each sub-element by multiplying the severity of each potential problem \nby its likelihood of occurrence.  \n \n4. Assessment of the Decision Tool in Industry \n \nThe proposed decision-making tool was produced as an Excel spreadsheet supported by \na paper workbook. The industrial assessment process was split into two stages; \nindustrial trial evaluation and practical application. The intention of the industrial trial \nevaluation was to seek expert opinions and to identify any problems and difficulties \nwith the developed decision tool prior to direct application in the case study. The \npractical application, on the other hand, was conducted to observe the application of the \nmethodology in practice in order to evaluate whether it is workable, gives a useful \noutput, and practical. \n \n4.1. Trial Evaluation \n \nThe industrial trial evaluation was conducted in four organisations, two from the \naerospace industry, one from the automotive industry and an automotive component \nmanufacturer. The participants were asked to have a trial interaction with the decision \ntool, to explore the stages and steps of the decision and assessment process. Thereafter, \na demonstration run was performed followed by a questionnaire. The outcome of this \nexamination was very valuable as it ensured face validity and led to constructive \nalterations. \n \n4.2. Practical Application \n \nThe case study adopted for the practical application was based on the latest equipment \nselection and acquisition process performed at the seals division at Rolls-Royce \ncompression systems plant in Inchinnan; the selection and acquisition of eight chip \nforming machines. The application was structured as follows: one day to conduct the \nfirst and second stage of the decision process (linking automation investment drives \n with evaluation criteria and automation alternative selection), and on the second day to \nconduct the third stage (decision risk assessment).  \nMoreover, an evaluation questionnaire was used to guide the assessment process during \nand after the practical application, and a diary was used to capture any comments and \nnote observations. The questionnaire was categorised into four sections to reflect the \nassessment methodology. The first three sections were designed to assess the feasibility \nand usability at the end of each stage in the decision tool, and the final section was \ndesigned to assess the feasibility, usability and usefulness of the overall process and \napproach [14, 15]. Sample questions used were \u201cOverall, did you find the methodology \neasy to follow? If not, could you state why not?\u201d and \u201cDid you find the tool to be user-\nfriendly and clear? If not, could you state why not?\u201d The full questionnaire can be found \nin [16]. \n \n4.3. Results  \n \nThe feedback gathered from assessing linking automation investment drivers with \nevaluation elements stage demonstrated the feasibility and usability of the first part of \nthe methodology. Overall, the user was able to follow the instructions and determine the \nweighting of the evaluation elements with contentment. The user\u2019s comment was \u201cI am \nquite happy with what I have seen and done.\u201d In addition, the user realised the \nimportance of utilising the investment drivers to determine the weighting of the \nevaluation elements. In the Rolls-Royce decision-making process the technical and \ncommercial evaluation attributes are considered as equal, which is questionable. \n \nMoreover, the feedback gathered from assessing automation alternative selection stage \ndemonstrated the feasibility and usability of the second part of the methodology. \nOverall, the user was able to follow the instructions and score the automation \nalternatives against the sub-evaluation elements without any difficulties. This stage of \nthe process is similar to the Rolls-Royce decision-making process, which involves \ntechnical and commercial evaluation attributes that are rated according to a scale. In \naddition, the best automation option identified from the automation alternative selection \n stage was the same as the historical outcome of the Rolls-Royce decision-making \nprocess.  \n \nThe feedback gathered from the decision risk assessment stage demonstrated the \nfeasibility and usability of the final part of the methodology. Overall, the user was able \nto follow the instructions and determine the associated risk with the selected automation \nalternative with simplicity. The user analysed the risk associated with the issues that \nwere negatively rated during the evaluation. In addition, the user carefully examined the \nissues that did not receive the highest rate of acceptance, and report the risk that could \nbe associated. However, the user pointed out that there should be a pop-up message \nasking to confirm data deletion when the reset option is selected, in order to avoid \naccidental data loss. \n \nFinally, the usefulness of the solution was understood by the user who pointed out that \nthe decision tool enabled users to consider and address people issues appropriately. In \naddition, the user did not think using the tool would make a better decision, \ncommenting \u201cOverall I think we have got the same result.\u201d However, the user noted that \nthe preparation and implementation would have been enhanced. The user\u2019s comment \nwas \u201cUltimately it lays out the risk areas and therefore starts making your project plan. \nIt makes you think how to mitigate the risk associated.\u201d In addition, the user stated the \nfollowing with regards to the evaluation criteria \u201cin the categorisation it gives a good \nguide to look at other areas you might not necessarily consider.\u201d   \nFurthermore, the weakness reported in comparison to the Rolls-Royce decision-making \nprocess was that it is more time consuming.  \n \n5. Discussion  \n \nThis research is based on academic literature and industrial survey [8]. The aim was to \ndevelop a tool that would incorporate human factors in the evaluation of different \nautomation alternatives at the manufacturing systems design stage. The potential benefit \nof the tool is an improved balance between the relative importance of technology, \norganisation and people at the earliest stages of manufacturing automation decision-\n making. This will improve the design and implementation processes for manufacturing \nsystems.  \n \nAccordingly, what has been described earlier is a framework that was devised to \nachieve this task. This decision-making framework was based on the deployment both \nthe quality function deployment (QFD) technique and the failure mode and effects \nanalysis (FMEA) technique. The decision-making and assessment criteria incorporated \nwere designed to ensure that the right proportions of technical, organisational, and \npeople issues are reviewed in the process. They specifically address strategic, financial, \norganisational, technical, integration, safety, and human factors. \n \nIn addition, the developed decision tool was evaluated in industry, through evaluation \nby demonstration and practical application. The evaluation by demonstration outcome \nresulted in positive feedback and constructive comments. Furthermore, the developed \ndecision tool was tested using real data and gave valid output. The best alternative \nsuggested for the case study was the same as the Rolls-Royce decision-making \noutcome. With the benefit of 6 months\u2019 hindsight the participant was able to claim that \nthe Rolls-Royce decision making process had led to the best outcome. The tool \ndescribed in this paper would also have suggested this outcome. This result support the \nview that the new developed decision tool is at least as valuable as Rolls-Royce\u2019s \nexisting process. Moreover, the participant indicated extra benefits of the new tool. \n \nThe decision tool highlighted various people issues that were not considered in Rolls-\nRoyce decision-making process and further analysed them in the risk assessment stage. \nThe participant comment regarding this issue \u201cin the categorisation it gives a good \nguide to look at other areas you might not necessarily consider.\u201d  In addition, it not only \nassisted in human factors incorporation alongside technical and organisational factors at \nthe initial stages of technology selection, but as well set out the risk areas and supported \nmitigating them.  \nFurthermore, the weakness indicated in Section 4.3 might not be considered as a \ndrawback. Even though the user stated that the tool consumes more time than the \n existing Rolls-Royce decision making process, it was added that this is not really a \nweakness as such decisions would require such assessment. \n \nOverall, the authors find the industrial evaluation feedback to be positively encouraging. \nHowever, as in any research, the more cases are used for the testing of the developed \nsolution, the more precise the conclusion will be. The authors are conscious that the \npractical application was performed in a single case study, and there is a need to \nperform more industrial applications to permit greater understanding of the decision \ntool\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in terms of execution and performance. \n \n6. Conclusion \n \nThe objectives of this paper were to highlight the importance of having a balanced \nconsideration of technology, organisation, and people issues in manufacturing \nautomation investment, and to present a decision methodology that addressed this issue. \nThis paper has described the development of a manufacturing automation decision \nsupport tool that is intended to support management not only in improving their \ndecision by addressing the right proportions of technical, organisational, and people \nissues, but also to be prepared for implementation and operation unforeseen problems.  \nFurthermore, the results from a practical application in industry were presented. Overall, \nthe results demonstrated the feasibility, usability, and usefulness of the proposed \nmethodology. \n \nFuture work needs to be done to further assess the benefits and weakness of the method \nproposed. Another interesting extension for this research would be the application of \nthis methodology in other areas of the manufacturing decision-making process, such as \nmanufacturing process selection.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Acknowledgements \n \n The authors wish to acknowledge the support of Rolls-Royce UK, particularly \nthe senior manufacturing engineers at the Inchinnan plant for their help in this research.  \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Womack J, Jones D.
