INTRODUCTION \nSome time ago Pendry et al1,2 studied the problem of low frequency plasmons in thin wire structures and proposed a \nsimple analytic theory to explain the principal feature characterizing their low frequency response to incident \nelectromagnetic radiation in the case of a periodic 2-D arrangement of such wires: the existence of an effective plasma \nfrequency below that of the bulk metallic value. In their thin wire model, which is notable for the fact that the result \ndepends only on geometrical factors and not the bulk plasma frequency, the effective plasma frequency is given by: \n                                                                               ( )\n2\n2\n, 2\n2\nln \/p eff\nc\na a r\n\u03c0\u03c9 =                                                        (1) \nwhere a is the lattice constant, r is the radius of the rods and c the free-space velocity of light. In practice, no propagation \ncan occur in the infinite structure below the effective plasma frequency, in analogy with the related effect in bulk \nmaterial. Since the work of Pendry et al a number of alternative simple analytic expressions for the effective plasma \nfrequency have been proposed 3,4,5 . There have also been various other theoretical studies of both the photonic \nbandstructure for infinite systems6,7 and transmission calculations in the case of finite structures8,9 . Experimental results \nhave been reported both in the original work of Pendry et al2 and also, more recently, by Pimenov and Loidl10 who \ninvestigated arrays of copper and steel wires using broadband terahertz spectroscopy.  \nIt should be noted that the effective plasma frequency model only applies in the situation where the electric field is \npolarized parallel to the direction of the axis of the rods (we shall refer to this as TM polarization). For the alternative TE \npolarization, in which the magnetic field is parallel to the rods, the effective plasma frequency model does not apply and \nthe results are rather similar to those expected for a standard dielectric photonic bandgap structure, apart from the \nexistence of additional, effectively dispersionless, localized plasmon states essentially confined to the surface of \nindividual rods6,11. \nIn the present work, in Section 2, we present brief details concerning a general 2-D plane-wave complex photonic \nbandstructure method. The method is then applied to a particular structure consisting of circular metallic rods in a square \nlattice, with results presented in Section 3.1. Section 3.2 describes a more general set of numerical results and compares \nthem to the predictions of various analytic theories for the effective plasma frequency that have been reported in the \nliterature, and compares these to our results. Our conclusions are presented in Section 4. \nInvited Paper\nNanomodeling II, edited by Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Sergey A.

THEORY OUTLINE \nIn a standard 2-D plane-wave photonic bandstructure formulation as described by for example Plihal and Maradudin12  \nthe wavevector k is fixed and it is then possible to calculate the frequency as a function of k throughout the Brillouin \nzone. This approach, however, only works provided that the structure has no components with a frequency-dependent \npermittivity, and is therefore not really applicable to metallic structures. An extension to the method allowing a \nfrequency-dependent permittivity to be used, was later described by Kuzmiak et al6 but nevertheless this only applies to a \npermittivity of the specific form ( ) 2 21 \/p\u03b5 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9= \u2212 . In practice, we would prefer to be able to deal with any general \nfrequency-dependent form for the permittivity, of any component in the structure, possibly including absorption, and this \ncan be achieved by employing a complex bandstructure formalism. Full details of our approach for both TM and TE \npolarizations are given elsewhere13 so in what follows we shall confine ourselves to giving only an outline of the method \nfor the case of TM polarization, the polarization of interest for the present work. \n  \nWe begin by assuming a 2-D periodic structure of the form shown in Fig. 1, although any more general cross-section is \npossible. \n \n \n \n \n \nFig.1 An array of circular rods having a frequency-dependent relative permittivity ( )\u03b5 \u03c9 embedded in a background \nmaterial for which the relative permittivity has a constant value b\u03b5 . \nThe permittivity is represented in the form \n \n                                                       ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ), b bx y S\u03b5 \u03b5 \u03c1 \u03b5 \u03b5 \u03c9 \u03b5 \u03c1= = + \u2212\u23a1 \u23a4\u23a3 \u23a6  \nwhere ( ) 1S \u03c1 =  within the rods and ( ) 0S \u03c1 = elsewhere.

As (2) involves a 2n x 2n general complex matrix with general complex \neigenvalues this process is somewhat more time-consuming than standard plane-wave bandstructure calculations. \n3. RESULTS \nWe now consider a series of 200 \u00b5m lattice constant arrays containing gold rods with a range of diameters from 10\u2192  \n120 \u00b5m, with specific detailed results for a 50 \u00b5m diameter rod structure presented in Section 3.1 and more general \nresults for the effective plasma frequency as a function of rod diameter presented in Section 3.2. Experimental colleagues \nare currently fabricating finite layer versions of such structures and detailed results for the transmission properties will be \navailable in due course. For our calculations we take the background permittivity to be that for air, 1b\u03b5 = , and to \nrepresent the permittivity of the gold rods we employ the Drude expression \n( ) ( )\n2\n1 p\nci\n\u03c9\u03b5 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9= \u2212 +  \nwhere values 152 2.175 10p\u03c9 \u03c0= \u00d7 \u00d7 s-1, for the bulk plasma frequency for gold, 122 6.5 10c\u03c9 \u03c0= \u00d7 \u00d7 s-1, the absorption \nterm, are taken from Ordal et al14. \n \n3.1 Square lattice with 200 \u00b5m lattice constant and 50 \u00b5m diameter gold rods \nAs an example of the form of the resultant bandstructure we show representative results for an array of 50 \u00b5m diameter \nrods in Fig. 2. The calculations were for wavevectors in a [100] direction and employed 805 plane waves for the E - field \nexpansion and in this case the absorption term has been omitted. The figure shows the existence of two purely imaginary \nk, evanescent, solutions over the range of frequencies displayed. Also shown is an initially evanescent solution with \nIm(k) \u2248 0.5 x (2\u03c0\/a) at low frequencies which evolves into a purely real solution, indicating the value of the effective \nplasma frequency, close to 0.67 THz, and giving rise to a pass band up to about 0.84 THz. A second pass band is present \nfrom about 1.16 \u2192 1.53 THz and a band gap region, corresponding to general complex wavevector, with Re(k) = 0.5 x \n(2\u03c0\/a)  is to be seen in the region between the two pass bands. At the centre of this band gap region, at \u2248 1 THz, we have \nthat Im(k) \u2248 0.15 x (2\u03c0\/a) corresponding to an E - field decay length of about one lattice constant. This indicates that for \nany finite structure consisting of more than a few layers there will be negligible transmission at frequencies \ncorresponding to the centre of the band gap region. At higher frequencies not shown in the figure the bandstructure \nbecomes more complicated with additional pass and stop bands. \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 6328  63280L-3\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 25 Jan 2011 to 129.234.252.67.

However, in the regions of the two pass bands, \nIm(k) is relatively small and consistent with electromagnetic wave decay in passing through the structure in the direction \ngiven by the sign of the group velocity in the respective band. The value of Im(k) is such that the E - field decay length is \nabout 15 periods at the centre of the first \u201cpass band\u201d and about 25 periods for the second band. The decay length at \nfrequencies corresponding to the central region between these two bands is little affected by the inclusion of the \nabsorption term. We note that the results are not particularly sensitive to the value of c\u03c9 ,and similar decay lengths \nwithin the bands are obtained even with significantly larger values of c\u03c9 .  \n \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n-1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5\nIm(k)         Units of 2\u03c0\/a         Re (k)\nFr\neq\nue\nnc\ny \n(T\nH\nz)\n \nFig. 2 Complex bandstructure of an array of 50 \u00b5m gold rods in a 200 \u00b5m period square lattice. The dashed and dotted lines \ncorrespond to purely imaginary wavevector solutions. The solid line indicates evanescent, purely imaginary, solutions \nin the region up to the effective plasma frequency at about 0.67 THz. Pass bands, corresponding to purely real k are \npresent in the ranges from about 0.67\u21920.84 THz and 1.16\u21921.53 THz with general complex solutions indicating a \nband gap region in between. There is no special significance to the sign of Im(k) and Re(k) in this plot, which is chosen \npurely for plotting convenience.    \nIn order to consider the transmission properties further we have also performed FDTD studies of the 50 \u00b5m diameter rod \n- 200  \u00b5m lattice constant structure. In particular, we have calculated the transmission for a 6-layer structure and the \nresults of these calculations are shown in Fig. 3. The calculations were performed by directing a short pulse of EM \nradiation at the structure and comparing the Fourier transforms of the incident and transmitted signals. There are inherent \nnumerical errors in this process as can be seen by the peak value of the transmission, which exceeds unity. We note that \nsimilar deconvolution errors are also to be expected in any experimental analysis as actual THz pulses tend to have a \nfairly complicated profile.  \nThe most notable feature in the calculated transmission spectrum is the large, broad peak centred at about 1.34 THz. The \nposition of this peak corresponds almost exactly with the centre of the second pass band found in the bandstructure \ncalculations. The smaller lower frequency peak, at about 0.83 THz, is slightly above the centre of the first band seen in \nthe bandstructure calculations but both calculations are in agreement with regard to the existence of a lower frequency, \nnarrower width band at these lower frequencies. In practice, due to the finite size of the structure employed for the \ntransmission calculations, we would expect to encounter some differences. Although not fully shown in Fig. 2 we note \nthat the bandstructure calculations also reveal other pass bands at about 1.64\u21921.72 THz and 1.9\u21922.2 THz and in the \nregion above 2.35 THz. We would not expect the first of these bands to be particularly distinguishable in transmission \nbecause, as can be seen in Fig. 2, the value of Im(k) is quite small in the region between bands 2 and 3 \u2013 in effect this \nband appears to turn up as a shoulder to the main peak.

We also note that \nthe minima in the transmission results at both \u2248 1.75 THz and just under 1 THz correspond almost exactly with peak \nvalues of Im(k) in the bandstructure calculations. Overall, we believe that that our results demonstrate good agreement \nbetween the bandstructure and FDTD transmission results. \n \n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\nFrequency, THz\nTr\nan\nsm\nis\nsi\non\n1.98 THz\n1.34 THz\n0.83 THz\n \nFig. 3 Plot showing the transmission for a finite structure consisting of 6 layers of  50 \u00b5m diameter gold rods in a 200 \u00b5m \nlattice constant array.

The centre of the first band shifts from about 0.6 THz to just \nover 1 THz, and the centre of the second band shifts from about 1.2 THz to 1.7 THz, following an increase in rod \ndiameter from 10 \u00b5m to 100 \u00b5m. In practice, if the absorption term in the Drude expression is included, there is little \noverall difference in the bandstructure but it becomes somewhat problematic to define precisely the positions of the band \nedges and hence the effective plasma frequency because all solutions are generally complex. However, the basic form of \nthe results is very similar so we define the effective plasma frequency as that at which we first observe the appearance of \npurely real k solutions, at the lower edge of the first pass band, without the absorption term.  \nIn Fig. 5 we show a plot of the effective plasma frequency as obtained by the above procedure from our plane-wave \ncalculations compared with the curves obtained from the analytic expressions given by Pendry et al1,2, eqn.

Overall, the best agreement is provided by the expression of Maslovski et al, although that of \nSarychev and Shalaev also works well. The Tretyakov expression gives results in good agreement with our results at \nlower frequencies but is much worse as the rod diameter is increased. We note that our calculations cannot be considered \nto be reliable for rod diameters much below 10 \u00b5m due to the number of plane waves employed. Nevertheless, in \nperforming calculations for very small diameter systems we note that the results obtained are in agreement with the \nexpression 2 2,p eff pf\u03c9 \u03c9= . In this regime our calculations perform in effect as if we have a uniform system characterised \nby the average electron concentration, and all structural detail is lost. \nWith regard to our plane-wave calculations, it should be pointed out that the convergence is such that the results are \nlikely to have an error of a few percent, with the actual effective plasma frequency probably being slightly lower than \nindicated in Figs. 4 and 5. This convergence problem is inherent to plane-wave calculations and does not have any \nsignificance with regard to our basic conclusions, nor is it likely to have any implications when using our method to \ncompare with experimental results. We have also carried out conventional ( )k\u03c9 plane-wave calculations employing a \nlarge and constant negative value for the permittivity of the gold rods and although these do reveal the existence of pass \nbands in somewhat similar positions, the convergence is significantly worse than in the current complex bandstructure \ncalculations. In practice, calculations have also been carried out for structures with the parameters given by Pimenov and \nLoidl10 and our results for the positions of the first pass band appears to be in good agreement with their reported \nexperimental results, confirming that convergence is adequate. This experimental work used somewhat larger period \nstructures with lattice constants of  0.45 to 0.9 mm but rather similar fill factors. \n4. CONCLUSIONS \nWe have presented results obtained from calculations of the complex photonic bandstructure of a set of metallic rod \nstructures. Specific comparison of the bandstructure results and those of FDTD calculations appear to demonstrate good \nagreement for a particular example of one of the systems. In considering a series of structures with differing rod \ndiameters we find good overall agreement with the simple analytic theory of Maslovski et al4 for the effective plasma \nfrequency. The THz range pass bands displayed in our results may be of practical use for THz filter applications. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nMAK acknowledges the financial assistance of EPSRC (UK), grant no.
