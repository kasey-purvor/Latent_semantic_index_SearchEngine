It\nconcentrates on his attempt to demolish the social\nmodel of disability, as well as his sketch of an\n\u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 approach to understanding \u2018\u2018disabil-\nity\u2019\u2019. Shakespeare\u2019s critique, it is argued, does\nBritish disability studies a \u2018\u2018wrong\u2019\u2019 by presenting\nit as a meagre discipline that has not been able to\nengage with disability and impairment effects in an\nanalytically sophisticated fashion. What was\nrequired was a measured presentation and evalua-\ntion of the rich mix of theoretical and empirically\nbased ideas to be found in the discipline, as the\ngroundwork for forward thinking located within a\nsocial oppression paradigm. Shakespeare\u2019s under-\nmining of the discipline\u2019s credibility in the eyes of\noutsiders and newcomers represents a diversionary\nmissed opportunity by an influential writer and\nactivist.\nShakespeare\u2019s book1 has certainly stirred up\ndebate, and invited a flurry of angry reviews, in\ndisability studies (DS) in the UK\u2014the social\nscience discipline that has been developing radical\nideas about disability and disablism since the\n1980s. Peopled by both disabled academics and\nlike-minded non-disabled researchers and writers,\nthe DS community recognises that Shakespeare\u2019s\nbook seeks to deliver a fatal wound to what he sees\nas its sacred cow: the British social model of\ndisability.\nShakespeare explains that what he calls the\n\u2018\u2018strong\u2019\u2019 version of the social model of disability\nwas formulated by Michael Oliver, a leading DS\nwriter and disability activist, on the basis of the\nsocial and political ideas advanced in the 1970s by a\ngroup of disabled individuals fighting to free\nthemselves from what they experienced as an\noppressive care system that relegated and segre-\ngated people with serious impairments to residen-\ntial institutions and to the category of the\nunemployable.2 3 In short, the social model asserts\nthat \u2018\u2018disability\u2019\u2019 is not caused by impairment but\nby the social barriers (structural and attitudinal)\nthat people with impairments (physical, intellec-\ntual and sensory) come up against in every arena.\nThe social model views disabled people as socially\noppressed, and it follows that improvements in\ntheir lives necessitates the sweeping away of\ndisablist social barriers and the development of\nsocial policies and practices that facilitate full social\ninclusion and citizenship. This \u2018\u2018problem and\nsolution\u2019\u2019 perspective has fuelled the British dis-\nabled people\u2019s movement\u2019s political programme\nand informed the research agenda in DS for the past\nthree decades. Many would agree that the results\nhave been very impressive, albeit partial and incom-\nplete\u2014for example, anti-discrimination legislation in\nthe form of the Disability Discrimination Act (1995,\n2005), \u2018\u2018direct payments\u2019\u2019 arrangements and wide-\nspread attitudinal change in favour of inclusion.\nAN ATTACK ON PARTISANSHIP\nShakespeare\u2019s rejection of the social model of\ndisability generates impassioned controversy\nbecause his stance represents a political, and indeed\nfundamentally ethical, intervention that, at least\npotentially, strikes at the heart of something more\nimportant and valuable than any \u2018\u2018this or that\u2019\u2019\nsocial scientific definitional formulation of disabil-\nity. His rejection can be read as an attack on an\navowedly \u2018\u2018standpoint\u2019\u2019 perspective, one that\neschews neutrality, though not objectivity, in\ntheory, research and policy. The social model is\npartisan; it is \u2018\u2018on the side\u2019\u2019 of disabled people and\nseeks to further their common sectional and\nindividual interests, their social and political\nequality and their full civil rights. Whatever the\nlimitations and lacunae of the social model may be,\nit is its partisanship that is really at issue in the\ncontroversy surrounding Shakespeare\u2019s book. As\nwe shall see below, his \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019 idea is that\n\u2018\u2018disability\u2019\u2019 occurs when there is an interaction of\n\u2018\u2018individual\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018social\u2019\u2019 factors. Although it may\nnot be Shakespeare\u2019s intention, this shifts disability\nto purportedly neutral epistemological territory. By\ndislodging \u2018\u2018disability\u2019\u2019 from its moorings in a social\noppression paradigm, the book causes deep disquiet\namong disability activists and DS scholars, because\nit opens the door to, and begins to hint at, an as yet\nill-defined rapprochement with \u2018\u2018medical model\u2019\u2019\nand \u2018\u2018individual model\u2019\u2019 thinking. The latter rest\nupon, or favour, biological reductionist explana-\ntions of disability, explanations that view disability\nas caused entirely, or principally, by bodily impair-\nment. Such explanations are accompanied by an\nemphasis on \u2018\u2018care\u2019\u2019 services and rehabilitation.\nThis \u2018\u2018full circle\u2019\u2019 overture leaves a very bad taste in\nthe mouths of many in DS and the disabled\npeople\u2019s movement.\nWHAT ARE THE SOCIAL MODEL\u2019S FAILINGS?\nShakespeare devotes part 1 of his book, the core\nsection that I choose to focus on here, to an\ninventory of the social model\u2019s failings. These boil\ndown to the accusations that the social model\nc was the product of Marxist thinking\u2014a now\nsupposedly outmoded theoretical and ideologi-\ncal system (pp10\u201314);\nc made a distinction between \u2018\u2018impairment\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018disability\u2019\u2019 that soon became \u2018\u2018ossified and\nexaggerated into a set of crude dichotomies\nwhich were ultimately misleading\u2019\u2019 (p13) (for\nexample, only social barriers \u2018\u2018disable\u2019\u2019; impair-\nment effects are irrelevant);\nc set up a lasting \u2018\u2018mythical dichotomy between\n\u2018\u2018medical\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018social model\u2019\u2019 thinking\u2019\u2019 (p26)\nEthics\nJ Med Ethics 2008;34:15\u201317. doi:10.1136\/jme.2006.019943 15\n group.bmj.com on May 5, 2010 - Published by jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \n(ie, the medical model views disability as caused entirely by\nimpairment, whereas the social model sees it as caused\nentirely by oppressive social barriers);\nc fails to recognise (1) that impairment plays a very significant\nrole in most disabled people\u2019s lives (pp38\u201348), and (2) that\n\u2018\u2018disability\u2019\u2019 would remain if all social barriers were\nremoved\u2014because impairment effects would continue to\nrestrict some people\u2019s activity (pp41\u201348);\nc has generated arrogance and stopped British activists and\nwriters recognising, let alone adopting, alternative progres-\nsive ways of conceptualising disability that are readily to be\nfound in other disciplines, such as medical sociology, and in\nother countries, such as the Nordic countries and North\nAmerica (p10);\nc rejects single-impairment organisations and campaigns that\nare desired by many disabled people and their families in\nfavour of cross-impairment political activism with only\nminority appeal (p32);\nc has \u2018\u2018largely failed to produce good empirical research\u2019\u2019 (p9)\nor defensible theory (pp52\u20133);\nc has \u2018\u2018become fatally undermined by its own contradictions\nand inadequacies\u2019\u2019 (p28).\nWhat is the provenance of these weighty objections? Readers\nof Shakespeare\u2019s book who are new to debates in DS can quickly\nform the mistaken impression that \u2018\u2018failings\u2019\u2019 and points of\ncontestation such as these have just come to light. In fact, the\nsocial model has been subject to critical scrutiny and debate\nwithin disability politics and DS for many years. The\nconceptual separation of impairment from disability (the\nimpairment\/disability dichotomy), for example, has been\nheavily lambasted from feminist and poststructualist theoretical\nquarters.4 Indeed, the weaknesses that arise from its being a\nsimple model of disability for political campaigning purposes,\nrather than a social theory for understanding the social\nconstruction and reproduction of disablism, have been exhaus-\ntively rehearsed.4 5\nEspecially from the early 1990s, many writers moved on from\nworking with a simplistic model in search of sophisticated\ntheoretical perspectives to use in conceptualising both \u2018\u2018dis-\nability\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018impairment\u2019\u2019,6 7 and empirical researchers got on\nwith examining the important issues thrown up by the initial\n\u2018\u2018social barriers\u2019\u2019 idea: that is, how to understand the disablist\nsocial relationships and forces (individual and collective) that\nwork both to directly socially exclude and to undermine the\npsychoemotional well-being of adults and children with\nimpairments\u2014for example, in the education system, in employ-\nment, in family and personal life, in housing, in healthcare, in\nthe leisure arena and so forth. One only needs to turn the pages\nof any issue of the international journal Disability & Society,\nbased in the UK and founded on the social model perspective, to\nget a flavour of the rich mix of sophisticated research- and\ntheory-based academic papers inspired by the social model and\nits sister perspectives across the world. (See, for example, the\nrecent special issue on Lessons from History: Disability & Society\n2006;21:383\u2013565.) It is quite astonishing that Shakespeare\nmakes no mention of this tremendously successful peer-\nreviewed journal. Many journal papers and other publications\nare devoted to the experiences and social needs of particular\ngroups among disabled people, notably children and adults with\nlearning difficulty. Shakespeare\u2019s accusations that the social\nmodel of disability did not kick-start high-quality empirical\nresearch and theoretical debate and has not encouraged\ninternational dialogue and exchange are simply not true.\nBritish DS is not the narrow and meagre discipline outlined in\nDisability rights and wrongs; rather, it is a vibrant and rapidly\nexpanding multi-disciplinary one in the social and human\nsciences in the UK\u2019s universities. Shakespeare\u2019s book uncon-\nscionably glosses over the very real theoretical, as well as\npractical, achievements made under the broad umbrella of the\nsocial model. The model\u2019s perspective opened up a novel\ntheoretical and research space on the social creation and\nconstruction of disability\u2014a space that advocates of the\n\u2018\u2018medical model\u2019\u2019 and of the \u2018\u2018individual model\u2019\u2019, including most\nmedical sociologists and psychologists, systematically over-\nlooked, ignored, marginalised or distorted.\nWAYS AHEAD: ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES\nI was writing my book Sociologies of disability and illness4 at the\nsame time as Tom Shakespeare was penning Disability rights and\nwrongs. Our approaches to the public presentation of DS and its\nkey ideas could not be more contrasting, and I cannot help but\nsee Shakespeare\u2019s book\u2014at least part 1\u2014as a diversionary\nmissed opportunity. I, by contrast, was at pains to showcase the\nrichness of the scholarship to be found in the discipline, and to\ndistinguish this corpus from other disciplinary approaches by\npositioning it within what I chose to call the social oppression\nparadigm. I wanted to inform readers by setting the diverse\ntheoretical perspectives and research traditions in British DS\u2014\nmaterialist, feminist, postructuralist, phenomenological\u2014along-\nside each other, and to compare these with theories and\ntraditions regarding chronic illness and disability to be found in\nmedical sociology. This could establish the weight and quality\nof the growing body of knowledge in DS. Put another way, I\nmade a conscious decision to describe the origins and features of\nthe social model of disability and to acknowledge its enormous\npolitical significance but thereafter to leave it aside, because it is\nnot a theory of disability in its own right. I favoured the notion that\nit is the social oppression or social exclusion perspective that\nmakes ideas in DS distinct and cutting edge, and I did not wish\nto lose this when thinking about ways ahead for the discipline.\nOn the other hand, I recognised the fundamental importance of\ntheorising and empirically researching impairment and its\neffects. The argument that is developed through the chapters\nof my book, and that retains the partisanship of the 1970s social\nmodellist pioneers, is that DS requires the further development\nof a sociology of disablism and impairment effects. Situated within\nthe social oppression paradigm, this would\n\u2026 make use of theories that engage both with social\nstructure (order) and social agency (action), and should\ntherefore accommodate analyses of social relations and social\nforces that construct, produce, institutionalise, enact and\nperform disability and disablism. The lived experience of\nboth disablism and impairment should have its place, as\nshould theorisations of impairment per se\u2014with chronic\nillnesses duly represented among categories of impairment\n(pp181\u20132).4\nIn his book, Shakespeare opted to rake over the coals of the\nsocial model of disability and to set out his epistemologically\nneutral and thus potentially multi-disciplinary \u2018\u2018alternative\u2019\u2019\nconceptualisation of disability\u2014one that, in his words, \u2018\u2018neither\nreduces disability to an individual medical problem, nor neglects\nthe predicament of bodily limitation and difference\u2019\u2019 (p2).\nShakespeare\u2019s key \u2018\u2018holistic\u2019\u2019 idea, not itself new, is as follows:\nThe experience of a disabled person results from the\nrelationship between factors intrinsic to the individual, and\nEthics\n16 J Med Ethics 2008;34:15\u201317. doi:10.1136\/jme.2006.019943\n group.bmj.com on May 5, 2010 - Published by jme.bmj.comDownloaded from \nextrinsic factors arising from the wider context in which she\nfinds herself. Among the intrinsic factors are issues such as:\nthe nature and severity of her impairment, her own attitudes\nto it, her personal qualities and abilities, and her personality.\nAmong the contextual factors are: the attitudes and reactions\nof others, the extent to which the environment is enabling or\ndisabling, and wider cultural, social and economic issues\nrelevant to disability in that society\u2019\u2019 (pp55\u20136).1\nIn Shakespeare\u2019s view, the adoption of this perspective would\nenable researchers and writers on DS to leave aside essentialist\nsocial oppression ideas and line up alongside those in the other\nsocial sciences and medical disciplines who are happy to make use,\nfor example, of the World Health Organization\u2019s relatively new\nICF (International classification of functioning, disability and health).8\nIn the many hours spent hunched over my computer writing\nSociologies, I considered, but rejected, approaches like\nShakespeare\u2019s to reformulating the concept \u2018\u2018disability\u2019\u2019 and\ntook a different path. Nevertheless, the astute among you may\nhave noticed that Shakespeare\u2019s and my own recommendations\nfor the way ahead are not, on the surface of things, a million\nmiles apart: that disabled individuals live lives shaped both by\nimpairment effects and by the effects of disablist social factors.\nAnd it is not accidental that I find myself agreeing with many of\nthe points and arguments that Shakespeare makes on sub-\nstantive topics in the very interesting later chapters: on\nbioethics, care, charity, personal relationships and the role of\nnon-disabled people. But, in the final analysis, our books are on\ndifferent sides of epistemological, political and moral divides,\nand that will be the cause of many (friendly) inter-personal\ndebates in the years ahead.\nCompeting interests: None declared\nREFERENCES\n1.
