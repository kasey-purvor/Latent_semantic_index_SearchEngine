In terms of the former it is the Lanthanum \nsilicate and germanate  materials, La9.33+z(Si\/GeO4)6O2+3z\/2 which have attracted \nconsiderable attention due to their high oxide ion conductivities at elevated \ntemperatures [1-17]. In contrast to the traditional fluorite and perovskite-type oxide ion \nconductors, where conductivity is mediated by oxide ion vacancies, the weight of \nexperimental and theoretical evidence for the apatite systems indicates that they conduct \nvia an interstitial mechanism. Consequently high conductivity is favoured by the \npresence of oxygen interstitials, which can be either present as oxygen \nhyperstoichiometry (z>0) or Frenkel defects [4,9,10,12,13].  \nSo far, the majority of the work on these apatite systems have focused on the silicate \nsystems, which can be partly related to the additional complexities shown by the apatite \ngermanates. In particular, the germanates are complicated by the change in the crystal \nsymmetry from hexagonal to triclinic as the La content\/oxygen content increases. In \nthis respect Leon-Reina et al. have reported the preparation of single phase samples of \nLa9.33+z(GeO4)6O2+3z\/2  for 0.19\u2264z\u22640.42, with samples in the range 0.19\u2264z\u22640.27 \npossessing hexagonal symmetry, while samples with higher La content, 0.33\u2264z\u22640.42, \nexhibit a triclinic cell [6]. In terms of potential applications the triclinic cell is not ideal, \nas it results in lower oxide ion conductivities at low temperatures, most likely due to \nenhanced defect trapping in the lower symmetry cell.  \nThe origin of the triclinic distortion in apatite materials has been discussed in detail by \nBaikie et al., where the authors have described the structure of apatite-type materials \n 4 \n(A10(MO4)6X2; A=alkaline earth, rare earth, Pb; M=Si, Ge, P, V; X=O, OH, Halides) in \nterms of a \u201cmicroporous\u201d framework (A(1)4(MO4)6) composed of face sharing A(1)O6 \ntrigonal meta-prismatic columns, that are corner connected to the MO4 tetrahedra \n(figure 1) [17]. This framework allows some flexibility to accommodate the remaining \nA(2)6X2 units. A triclinic apatite cell is obtained in systems such as the lanthanum \ngermanates due to the large size of the A(1)4(MO4)6 framework. This places extension \nstress at the A cation site in the A(2)6X2 unit, and compression stress at the M site, \nwhich are relieved by the MO4 tetrahedra tilting in the triclinic cell. The presence of \ninterstitial oxygen atoms also enhances triclinic distortion, most probably by \ncontributing to a further expansion of the A(1)4(MO4)6 framework, hence accounting \nfor the fact that samples with low oxygen excess (z\u22640.27) are hexagonal, whereas \nhigher oxygen content samples are triclinic [6] \nThe ideal way to overcome this structural stress would be to increase the size of the \nA(2) cations. Thus Ca10V6O24F2 is triclinic, while isovalent doping with the larger Pb \ncation results in hexagonal symmetry [17]. However, such an isovalent doping strategy \nis not possible for La9.33+z(GeO4)6O2+3z\/2, as La is the largest lanthanide. Therefore, we \nhave investigated an alternative approach, namely the doping of a smaller rare earth, Y, \ninto La9.33+z(GeO4)6O2+3z\/2, with the aim of selectively substituting for the La site  in the \nA(1)4(MO4)6 framework in order to relieve strain by reducing the size of this \nframework. Atomistic modelling studies of the related apatite lanthanum silicates have \npredicted a preference for Y substitution in the A(1)4(MO4)6 framework [18].  In this \npaper we confirm that such site selective doping is successful, and does indeed lead to \nthe formation of hexagonal apatites even for high oxygen contents.  \n \nExperimental  \n 5 \n \nSamples, La9.33+z-xYx(GeO4)6O2+3z\/2 (0\u2264z\u22640.67; x=1, 2, 3), were prepared from high \npurity La2O3, Y2O3 and GeO2. The dried powders were intimately mixed in the correct \nratios and heated to 1100\u00b0C for 24 hours with an intermediate regrind. Phase purity was \nestablished through X-ray powder diffraction (Panalytical X\u2019Pert Pro diffractometer, Cu \nK\u03b11 radiation). For preliminary structural studies to determine the location of the Y \ndopant, data were collected over 12 hours in the range 10-120\u00b0 (2\u03b8). Rietveld analysis \nwas then performed using the GSAS suite of programs, with the fits compared for Y on \neach of the La sites [19].  \nPellets (1.6 cm diameter) for conductivity measurements were prepared as follows: the \npowders were ball milled (350 rpm, Fritsch Pulverisette 7 Planetary Mill) for 1 hour \nbefore pressing at 8000 kg cm-2. The pressed pellets were then heated at 1300\u00b0C for 2 \nhours, leading to densities > 85% theoretical. Both sides of the pellet were coated with \nAu paste and then heated to 700\u00b0C for 1 hour to ensure bonding to the pellet. \nConductivity measurements were made in air using AC impedance spectroscopy \n(Hewlett Packard 4182A impedance analyser).  \n \nResults and discussion \n \nX-ray diffraction indicated that single phase samples of  La9.33+z-xYx(GeO4)6O2+3z\/2 were \nformed for 0.22\u2264z\u22640.67 (y=1, 2, 3), representing a larger solid solution range compared \nto that reported by Leon-Reina et al. for the undoped system (0.19\u2264z\u22640.42) [6]. \nContrary to samples without Y doping, where a hexagonal lattice is obtained for \n0.19\u2264z\u22640.27, with triclinic samples observed for higher values of z, all Y doped \ncompositions (0.22\u2264z\u22640.67) were shown to be hexagonal (figure 2).  \n 6 \nIn order to determine the location of the Y dopant, preliminary refinement of X-ray \ndiffraction data was performed for a range of samples. In all cases the R factors were \nlowest for Y located in the A cation site within the A(1)4(MO4)6 framework (e.g. \nLa8Y2(GeO4)6O3; Chi2 = 2.83 (Y on A(1) site), 4.67 (Y on A(2) site). Thus in \nagreement with the predicted strategy, selective doping of Y in the A(1)4(MO4)6 \nframework stabilises the hexagonal lattice. Due to the general insensitivity of X-rays to \nlight atoms, such as oxygen, and the considerable structural distortion around the \ninterstitial site, further more detailed neutron diffraction studies are planned to \nstructurally characterise these systems fully, particularly to elucidate the oxygen \ninterstitial sites. \nRefinement of the cell parameters shows that the Y doping leads to an overall reduction \nin unit cell size as expected due to the smaller size of Y3+ compared to La3+, with the \ncell parameters obeying Vegard\u2019s law, consistent with Y substitution on the same site \nacross the series. However, this contraction is not uniform in all directions, with the \nmain contraction along the c axis. This can be most clearly visualised by plotting the % \nchange along each of the unit cell axes with increasing Y content (figure 3). Further \nincreases in Y content are also possible, i.e. x>3, however peak broadening indicative \nof a return to the triclinic cell is observed for these higher Y dopant levels.  \nHigh oxide ion conductivities were observed for all samples (0.025-0.040 Scm-1 at \n800\u00b0C). Compared to triclinic La9.33+z(GeO4)6O2+3z\/2 samples without Y doping, the \nconductivities were enhanced at lower temperatures, while at higher temperatures they \nare comparable (figure 4). The convergence of the data at higher temperatures (>700\u00b0C) \ncan be related to the fact that in this temperature range, even the undoped  \nLa9.33+z(GeO4)6O2+3z\/2 samples are hexagonal; prior reports showing that there is a \nchange from a triclinic to a hexagonal cell at high temperatures [7,16]. Thus the \n 7 \nenhanced lower temperature conductivity can be correlated with the more facile oxide \nion conduction within the higher symmetry hexagonal lattice.  \n \nConclusions \n \nIn summary, we have shown that site selective doping of La9.33+z(GeO4)6O2+3z\/2 with a \nsmaller rare earth, Y, leads to a stabilisation of the hexagonal lattice, even for high \noxygen contents. Furthermore this has the effect of enhancing the low temperature \nconductivities.   \n \nReferences \n1. S. Nakayama, H. Aono, Y. Sadaoka, Chem. Lett. (1995) 431. \n2. S. Nakayama, M. Sakamoto, M.
