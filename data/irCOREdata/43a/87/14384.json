The questions posed will inform the research as it devel-\nops further. However, in the interests of debate we would like to give our initial replies.\nWe agree in general with Andy Heath\u2019s assessment of the limitations of the\napproach we are adopting. We recognise that this approach uses a very limited\nresponse to AccessForAll principles: our Transformation Augmentation and Substi-\ntution Service (TASS) is localised, not global, and relies on a limited set of learning\npatterns matched against a small subset of the potentially infinite set of learner\nprofiles. Our intention is certainly not to reproduce the considerable efforts of the\nIMS AccessForAll or Dublin Core Adaptability working groups, but to interpret their\npotential impact on the thinking of courseware designers, tutors and students.\nOur ultimate aim is to broaden the service, but we need to begin with a limited set,\nworking on known profiles, so that the more general requirements can be determined.\nAlso we are proposing a system that will enable the tutor to select a template or create\ntheir own when there is no suitable one in the library. We accept that our library of\ntemplates and exemplar profiles will be restricted, but we do not feel this is an argu-\nment for not having templates. Tutors need access to a simple system that encapsu-\nlates best practice.\nIn our model we accept the fact that learners will have their personal profiles and\nthat: \n\u2026 resources are matched at delivery time with functional requirements of learners or users\nthat are relevant to that immediate context.\n*Corresponding author.

Green et al.\nHowever, the point about profiles being anonymous is more than the fact that they\nare geared to a learner and context, in that there is no need for an individual to iden-\ntify his or her disabilities or dysfunctions. From this we might propose that needs,\npreferences and contexts can be anticipated in the abstract or general sense. There is\nno suggestion, however, that this is anything other than a pragmatic position. Clearly\nany number of contexts, needs or preferences might be encountered that were not\nactually anticipated. However, as with allowing personalised web interfaces based on\nstyle-sheets, it is usually best if a user starts by modifying an existing style-sheet rather\nthan specifying all elements from scratch.\nThe second point about the IMS AccessForAll approach is \u2018that the components\nthat comprise a delivered resource can be assembled from distributed sources\u2019.\nUltimately we would agree that our TASS would use a global federated search to\nassemble its components, and as such would be an instance of an AccessForAll\nservice. However, the initial idea is to trial the service using only localised searches.\n(As it happens, Teesside subscribes to the LRC3 catalogue from University of NSW,\nSydney Australia, which is federated with MERLOT and other international cata-\nlogue services, giving direct access to a very large number of learning objects.) Our\nview is that even a simple, localised service would need more intelligence than we can\ninitially anticipate. For example, a tutor determines that they wish to employ a learn-\ning pattern based on an initial description of a concept, an animated simulation and\na multiple choice test. It is not obvious from this description, without knowing more\ndetails of the subject matter and context of the learning activity, whether an audible\nexplanation of the simulation would make any sense to a person who had expressed\na need for a non-visual presentation. The probability in this instance would be that\nan alternative learning pattern (rather than a substitution for the simulation compo-\nnent) would be needed.\nHere it might be appropriate to take some of Andy Heath\u2019s comments in more\ndetail: \nThe existence of a generic anonymous set of preferences is not the same as the preferences\nof an individual learner. It is like a \u2018type\u2019 statement for a variable as can occur in a\ncomputer program. It is not an example value.\nWe suggest that TASS would respond directly to \u2018channels\u2019 rather than full profiles. A\nnumber of channels could form a profile and that might be regarded as a \u2018type\u2019 but we\nare providing instantiations (real values) for these types, from which a user can select.\nThe implication that potential users will have little or no input is not the case. Whether\nthe user would have enough input is open to debate. In our experience, users can be\ngiven too much choice as well as too little, especially if that choice is not fully informed. \nIt is not distinct from the notion of a Universally Accessible Resource, which the paper\nrightly points out is a flawed notion because it is not achievable \u2026 Design patterns and\nguidelines are useful but more work is needed to explore how they may be used in practice\nwithout being misused.\nLearning patterns allow us to separate the various parts of a learning object based on\na functional hierarchy ranging from the pedagogical design approach to media\nLearning patterns and learner profiles in learning object design 205\ncomponent. We can then perform standard transformations, augmentations and\nsubstitutions that will have a good chance of working. This is not aiming at a universal\nresource at all, but rather utilising a set of known patterns that are useful in a partic-\nular context. \nIn an AccessForAll world, where components of a learning object can be assembled at or\nclose to run time \u2026 the person that authored the adaptation may not be the person that\nhad the design template in mind. It seems that the notion of design templates may require\nthat all authors become Accessibility-Aware. This is not likely to happen.\nOn the contrary, we take the view that all staff should be accessibility-aware. It is a\nlegal requirement, after all, that resources should be accessible. That is not to say that\nall staff need the skills to produce accessible material; our approach provides a mech-\nanism for producing materials that are adaptable (although not universally accessible)\nwithout the need for specialist skills. However, there will always be specific needs that\nare not catered for by patterns and templates, and these must be addressed by skilled\nauthors. We do not deny this. As we say in the paper, the production of truly acces-\nsible learning objects is liable to be a collaborative activity.\nWe agree with the argument that classroom teachers do use \u2018design templates\u2019\nbecause they know what patterns will and will not work, but that sometimes \u2018we need\nto just break all the rules and do something different because it works\u2019. No set of\nlearning patterns, however exhaustive, will cater for every eventuality, but the fact\nthat design templates are not always useful is not an argument for not using them at\nall. However, we accept the caution here and echo the words of the IMS AccessForAll\nworking group that we do not expect to get it right first time (or even second, third or\nfourth time). We expect to learn from our experiences and refine our model. \nIn this analysis it seems to me that design templates in this context represent a half-way\nhouse between the world where we say to learners \u2018here is what I think you need to access\nthis stuff\u2019 and a world where learners say \u2018here is what I need to access this stuff\u2019.\nWe agree whole-heartedly with this analysis. However our approach is not particu-\nlarly novel: it is normal that authors produce content in the form that they think will\nbe useful. It is then refined through feedback from its users. We also expect to evalu-\nate our TASS as well as the IMS AccessForAll and Dublin Core \u2018Adaptability\u2019 stan-\ndards as part of the process.\nFinally, the questions posed: \n1. What is the value of talking about groups of learners?\nWe wish to find commonality in needs and preferences where possible. The abil-\nity to deal with groups allows us to work at a higher level of abstraction and\nshould make anticipation of individual needs more effective. Learner profiling\nwith people with disabilities in FE has proven to be an effective approach in the\npast. However, we also accept that ultimately any service has to be responsive to\nindividual needs and preferences.\n2. How can we ensure Design Templates are not misused?\n206 S. Green et al.\nWe can never prevent misuse. However, with proven guidelines, staff develop-\nment, specialist support and increased awareness we would expect tutors to\nbecome more familiar with the potential of such templates, and therefore better\nable to employ them.\n3. How can Design Templates cater for repressed demand \u2014where a user may only\nselect from what is available and not know to say \u2018I want this\u2019?\nA Design Template can only cater for the type of demand that the tutor has\ndirectly anticipated. That may or may not be matched by an appropriate trans-\nformation, augmentation or substitution. If this is not catered for directly because\nthe alternative component cannot be provided, then our service (the TASS)\nwould defer to a wider global service (IMS AccessForAll) if and when that service\nbecame available. Additionally, the mismatch would provide information that\nwould allow interested parties to provide the alternate component at a later date.\nSENDA requires an Institution to be \u2018anticipatory\u2019 in meeting the needs of\ndisabled students. Needs are often met as a result of identified barriers, resulting\nin \u2018just in time\u2019 developments. Even where a less than ideal compromise has to\nbe made, the need can now be \u2018anticipated\u2019 for future learning experiences.\n4. How can Design Templates be used across systems and organisations in ways\nthat remain responsive to real individual requirements?\nPatterns and templates are derived from successful use of similar resources. Thus\nthey meet a known requirement. Adaptation to individual needs and preferences\nwill require more work (as suggested earlier) but we need to start somewhere.\nAdaptations will be refined through evaluation and feedback, with the new\nknowledge gained being fed back into the TASS design. Designers of systems\nneed to be closer to the human experience than is often the case: in a sense we\nare suggesting adopting a \u2018human systems\u2019 rather than a \u2018computer science\u2019 or\n\u2018programming\u2019 approach to designing our TASS and adaptable learning objects.\nHowever, we should also remember that adaptability is not the whole require-\nment; a learning object needs to meet the learning outcomes and maintain its\npedagogical integrity. The Learning Technology Research Institute\u2019s work, on\nwhich we are building, was based on the development of learning objects that are\npedagogically sound and have been thoroughly evaluated to prove their value to\nlearners. That is part of the reason for adopting the patterns on which they are\nbased. We are trying to enrich the resources by making them both pedagogically\nsound and adaptable.\nTo conclude, the debate is not over. We need a better understanding of the use of\nlearning patterns and learner profiles over a much wider range of contexts than we\nhave so far been able to explore. Currently we are working on the design of the\nproposed tutor tools and TASS service as well as planning for the collection of a set\nof exemplar profiles of needs and preferences. This research represents a synergy of\nLearning patterns and learner profiles in learning object design 207\nthe work on learning patterns and generative learning objects at the Learning\nTechnology Research Institute, London Metropolitan University and on accessible\nweb services and learner profiles at the Accessibility Research Centre, University of\nTeesside. However, this collaboration, although productive, is still in its infancy.\n"}
