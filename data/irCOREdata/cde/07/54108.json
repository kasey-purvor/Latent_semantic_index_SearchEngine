INTRODUCTION  \nMobile user equipments (UEs) are becoming increasingly \nindispensable in our daily lives, but almost all current cellular \nnetworks are facing problems of imperfect coverage, especially \nindoors. One cost-effective solution for mobile operators to \nimprove coverage is the emerging femtocell network, where \nfemtocell access points (FAPs) [1] are overlaid on macrocells. \nEach FAP provides high-data-rate connections to UEs within a \nshort range using the same radio-access technology as the \nmacrocell underlay. Indoor femtocells can solve the problem of \nweak macrocell signals inside buildings and offload a large \namount of traffic from outdoor macrocells. On the other hand, \northogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) has \nbeen considered in the downlink for next generation wireless \nnetworks [2-3]. OFDMA-based femtocell is widely expected to \ndeliver massive improvements in coverage and capacity [1]. \nInter-cell interference management is among the most urgent \nchallenges that operators must face before femtocells can be \ncommercially deployed, given that most femtocells will be \ndeployed within coverage of macrocells. As plug-and-play \ndevices, most FAPs will be deployed by end users. The number \nand locations of active FAPs are thus by no means known to \noperators. Therefore, interference caused by femtocells cannot \nbe managed using conventional network planning methods. \nInterference avoidance strategies [4], wherein femtocells avoid \nrather than suppress inter-cell interference, would be more \nlikely to work. Furthermore, inter-cell interference in a hybrid \nmacro\/femto network depends largely on the femtocell access \npolicy used, which defines how a femtocell allows or restricts \nits usage to users or UEs [4]. In this paper, we will focus on the \nclosed-access femtocell, which serves a group of authorized \nUEs only, because closed access would be preferred by home \nsubscribers of the femtocell [5].  \nTo mitigate inter-cell interference, frequency reuse [6-8] and \ninter-cell coordination [9-10] schemes have been studied in \nOFDMA macro networks. A centralized downlink frequency \nplanning across femto and macro cells was proposed in [11], \nbut the very large number of femtocells may significantly \ncomplicate the centralized optimization process. The spectrum \nallocation policy in [12] avoids cross-tier interference by \nassigning orthogonal spectrum resources to the macro tier and \nthe femto tier, and mitigates femto-to-femto interference by \nallowing each femtocell to access only a random subset of the \nspectrum resources that are assigned to the femto tier. \nHowever, many operators do not have enough spectra to assign \na dedicated spectrum for femtocell deployments. Femtocells \nmay have to operate in the same spectrum as macrocells due to \nspectrum availability and infrastructure considerations [11].  \nIn this paper, we propose a decentralized resource allocation \nscheme for the OFDMA downlink of a shared-spectrum hybrid \nmacro\/femto network, in the effort to achieve decentralized \ninter-cell interference avoidance. OFDMA radio resources are \npartitioned in the time and frequency domains into resource \nblocks (RBs) [13]. In this resource allocation scheme, for each \ntransmission time interval, a macrocell can use all the available \nRBs, while each femtocell can only randomly select a subset of \nthe available RBs for transmission. As a result, the average \nnumber of interfering femtocells in each RB is reduced. How \nthe size of the RB-subset should be decided with respect to the \ntotal number of available RBs per transmission time interval is \nstudied based on per-cell or network-wide performance \nmetrics, which are outage probability, spatial throughput [14], \nthroughput per cell, and areal spectral efficiency [12]. The \nperformance of the decentralized resource allocation scheme is \nevaluated through simulations. \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The system \nmodel is described in Section II. The decentralized resource \nallocation scheme and performance metrics are presented in \nSection III. Simulation results and their interpretation are \nprovided in Section IV. Conclusions are drawn in Section V. \n \n1 This work was supported in part by EPSRC CASE\/CNA\/07\/106. \n2 Corresponding author: Xiaoli Chu (xiaoli.chu@kcl.ac.uk) \n 2\nII. SYSTEM MODEL \nWe consider the OFDMA downlink of a shared-spectrum \nhybrid macro\/femto network. The central hexagonal macrocell \nhas a radius of rM. The macro base station (BS) B0 is located in \nthe middle of the macrocell. There are UM outdoor macro UEs \nrandomly distributed over the macrocell coverage area. For \nsimplicity, co-channel interference from neighboring macrocell \ntransmissions is ignored [15]. Closed-access femtocells are \nrandomly overlaid on the macrocell. The locations of FAPs at a \npoint in time form a stationary Poisson point process (SPPP) on \nR2 [14], with a spatial intensity of \uf06cF, which gives the average \nnumber of femtocells per unit area. Each femtocell has a radius \nof rF and serves UF indoor UEs. If the mean number of \nfemtocells per macrocell is given by NF, then the total number \nof UEs served by the hybrid macro\/femto network is given by \nU = UM + NFUF.  \nThe basic resource unit that is addressable for OFDMA \ntransmissions is an RB, which is a two-dimensional concept \ndefined in the time-frequency space. In the 3GPP Release 8 \n[13], an RB has the time-duration of 1 ms and spans either 12 \nsubcarriers with a subcarrier bandwidth of 15 kHz or 24 \nsubcarriers with a subcarrier bandwidth of 7.5 kHz. Intra-cell \ninterference is avoided by maintaining orthogonality between \nco-cell UEs in OFDMA networks [12], [16], i.e., one scheduled \nUE per RB in each cell. Without loss of generality, we assume \nthat a macro BS or an FAP assigns equal transmission power to \nall RBs for a given transmission time interval [12]. Since \ncellular networks are mostly interference limited, thermal noise \nat the receiver is neglected in this paper.  \nThe downlink channel from a BS\/FAP to a UE is composed \nof a possible deterministic wall-penetration loss component, a \ndeterministic distance-dependent path-loss component (with a \nfixed path-loss exponent), and a random distance-independent \ncomponent, which includes both slowly-varying lognormal \nshadowing and Rayleigh fast fading [14]. Independent and \nidentically-distributed shadowing and fading statistics are \nassumed across all RBs for a given transmission time interval. \nThe shadowing and fading coefficients are assumed to remain \nconstant within each RB but may vary from one RB to another. \nAccordingly, for a given RB, the received signal-to-\ninterference ratio (SIR) at a macro UE is given by  \n\uf0e5\n\uf046\uf0ce\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\ni\niii XBP\nADP\nMF\nM\nM\nMM\nMSIR \uf061\n\uf061\n\uf066                         (1)  \nwhere DM is the distance from the macro BS B0 to the macro \nUE, |XMi| is the distance from FAP i to the macro UE, \uf061M is the \npath loss exponent on the link from the macro BS to the macro \nUE, \uf061MF is the path loss exponent on the link from an FAP to \nthe macro UE, PM is the transmission power of the macro BS, \nPi is the transmission power of FAP i, \uf066 represents wall-\npenetration loss, A is the random channel gain from the macro \nBS to the macro UE, Bi is the random channel gain from FAP i \nto the macro UE, and \uf046 denotes the set of interfering FAPs. \nFor a given RB, the received SIR of a femto UE is given by \n\uf0e5\n\uf046\uf0ce\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf03d\ni\niii XHPQDP\nGrP\nFFFM\nF\nF\n2\nFM\nFF\nFSIR \uf061\uf061\n\uf061\n\uf066\uf066             (2)  \nwhere DF is the distance from the macro BS to the femto UE, \n|XFi| is the distance from an interfering FAP i to the femto UE, \uf061F is the path loss exponent on the link from the home FAP to \nthe femto UE, \uf061FM is the path loss exponent on the link from \nthe macro BS to the femto UE, \uf061FF is the path loss exponent on \nthe link from an interfering FAP to the femto UE, PF is the \ntransmission power of the home FAP, G is the channel gain \nfrom the home FAP to the femto UE, Q is the channel gain \nfrom the macro BS to the femto UE, and Hi is the channel gain \nfrom an interfering FAP i to the femto UE. We consider the \nworst case that all femto UEs are located on the edge of their \nhome femtocell. Double wall-penetration losses are assumed \nfor all links from interfering FAPs to the femto UE of interest.  \nIn (1) and (2), by defining different path-loss exponents (i.e., \n\uf061M, \uf061MF, \uf061F, \uf061FM and \uf061FF), different random channel gains (i.e., \nA, Bi, G, Q and Hi) and the wall-penetration loss factor (i.e., \uf066), \ndifferent radio propagation characteristics of outdoor and \nindoor channels are taken into account. \n \nIII. RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN MACRO\/FEMTO NETWORKS \nA. Decentralized Resource Allocation \nIn OFDMA networks, inter-cell interference can be avoided \nfrom a perspective of temporal and spectral reuse of radio \nresources in different cells. For a shared-spectrum hybrid \nmacro\/femto network that employs OFDMA in the downlink, \nwe propose a decentralized resource allocation scheme that can \nprovide randomized interference avoidance. Given that there \nare F distinct RBs in total for each transmission time interval, \nwe allow a macro BS to use all the F RBs for its downlink \ntransmissions, but an FAP to use only K (\uf0a3 F) RBs, where both \nF and K are positive integers. For ease of implementation, the \nvalue of K is kept the same for all femtocells. Accordingly, the \nfraction of radio resources per transmission interval accessible \nby each femtocell is given by  \n\uf072F = F\nK\n                                         (3) \nwhere 0 < \uf072F \uf0a3 1 by definition. In the special case of \uf072F = 1, \neach femtocell has access to all the available RBs. \nIf each femtocell chooses the K distinct RBs independently \nand with equal probability, the probability of a femtocell \nselecting a given RB for transmission is given by  \nPr = \uf072F                                          (4) \nwhich shows that the average number of interfering femtocells \nin each RB is effectively reduced, mitigating both femto-to-\nmacro and femto-to-femto interference.  \nTherefore, the set \uf046 in (1) and (2) is actually the set of FAPs \nthat have access to the given RB. At a point in time, the set \uf046 \nforms a marked SPPP and has a spatial intensity of \uf06cF\uf072F (\uf0a3 \uf06cF).  \n \nB. Performance Metrics \nPerformance of the decentralized resource allocation scheme \nis evaluated based on four different per-cell or network-wide \nperformance metrics, which are able to effectively show how \nthe probability of each femtocell transmitting in a given RB, \n 3\ni.e., \uf072F, affects the performance per cell or the performance of \nthe whole hybrid macro\/femto network. \nUnder the assumptions made in Section II and Section III-A, \nthe outage probability of a macro UE and of a femto UE is \ngiven respectively by \nqM(\uf072F) = Pr(SIRM < \uf067M)                             (5) \nqF(\uf072F) = Pr(SIRF < \uf067F)                              (6) \nwhere \uf067M and \uf067F are the SIR requirements of a macro UE and a \nfemto UE, respectively. \nBased on the definition of outage probability, spatial \nthroughput is defined as the expected spatial density of \nsuccessful transmissions [14]. The spatial throughput of the \nhybrid macro\/femto network, subject to SIR requirements of \uf067M \nand \uf067F, is given by \n\uf074(\uf072F) = \uf06dM[1 \u2013 qM(\uf072F)] + \uf06cF\uf072F[1 \u2013 qF(\uf072F)]                (7) \nwhere \uf06dM is the spatial density of macro UEs that have access \nto a given RB. \nIf adaptive modulation with L (> 0) discrete rates is adopted, \nthen when the received SIR lies in [\uf047l, \uf047l+1), for l \uf0ce {1, \u2026, L}, \nthe BS or FAP decides the transmission rate according to \n (b\/s\/Hz) ,1log2 \uf0f7\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\uf0e7\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf059\n\uf047\uf02b\uf03d llb                       (8) \nwhere \uf059 is the Shannon gap for QAM modulations [12].  \nIf each UE feedbacks the instantaneous SIR in a given RB to \nits home BS or FAP, i.e., impact of imperfect feedback and\/or \nchannel estimation is not considered, then the expected \nthroughput per cell (in b\/s\/Hz) [12] is given by \n \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029LLL\nl\nlll bbT \uf047\uf0b3\uf02b\uf047\uf03c\uf0a3\uf047\uf03d\uf0e5\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02b M\n1\n1\n1MM SIRPrSIRPr     (9) \n \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9 \uf047\uf0b3\uf02b\uf047\uf03c\uf0a3\uf047\uf03d \uf0e5\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02b LL\nL\nl\nlll bbT F\n1\n1\n1FFF SIRPrSIRPr\uf072 (10) \nThe areal spectral efficiency (ASE) (in b\/s\/Hz\/m2) of the \nhybrid macro\/femto network is then given by  \nASE = \uf06dMTM + \uf06cFTF                              (11) \n \nIV. SIMULATION RESULTS \nWe perform simulations based on the performance metrics \ndefined in Section III-B, in order to study how the fraction of \nradio resources accessible by each femtocell per transmission \ntime interval should be determined in the decentralized \nresource allocation scheme.  \nIn the simulations, the spatial distributions of outdoor macro \nUEs and indoor femto UEs on the R2 plane are obtained by \nindependently generating each DM or DF following a uniform \ndistribution in the range of [1, rM], where we assume that all \nUEs and FAPs are at least 1 meter away from the central \nmacro BS; and the angular direction of each UE or FAP with \nrespect to the central macro BS is independently generated \nfollowing a uniform distribution in (0, 2\u03c0]. Without loss of \ngenerality, we assume all FAPs have the same transmission \npower PF, and the Rayleigh fast fading has a unit average \npower. In the calculations for (9) to (11), we set bl = l and \uf047l = \n\uf059(2l \u2013 1), for l = 1, \u2026, L. The values of major system \nparameters used in the simulations are given in Table I.  \nFig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the outage probability versus \uf072F, for \nNF = 50, 100, and 200. In Fig. 1, \uf066 = 5 dB, \uf061MF = \uf061FF = 4, \nrepresenting a relatively high-attenuation channel, and rM = \n1000 m. In Fig. 2, \uf066 = 2 dB, \uf061MF = \uf061FF = 3.5, representing a \nlow-attenuation channel, and rM = 300 m. In both figures, we \ncan observe that the outage probabilities of macro UEs and \nfemto UEs increase with the increase of \uf072F and NF. This is \nbecause the interference caused by femtocells becomes severer \nwhen each femtocell accesses a larger fraction of the available \nRBs and with a higher spatial intensity of femtocells. In order \nto maintain a specific outage probability for a macro UE or a \nfemto UE, a reduced \uf072F has to be used for a larger NF. \nTABLE I.

This is due to \nthe double wall-penetration losses with \uf066 = 5 dB between \nneighboring femtocells. In Fig. 2, with a much shorter radius \nof the macrocell, for the same values of NF as in Fig. 1, the \nspatial intensities of femtocells become much higher. The high \nfemtocell density combined with the low-attenuation channel \ncontributes to a significant increase of interference from \nfemtocells, leading to unacceptably high outage probabilities \nof both macro and femto UEs. \nFig. 3 and Fig. 4 plot the spatial throughput versus \uf072F, under \nthe same conditions as in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. Fig. 3 \nshows that the spatial density of successful transmissions in the \n 4\nhybrid macro\/femto network increases with the increase of \uf072F \nand NF, under a high-attenuation channel and with relatively \nlow spatial densities of femtocells. In Fig. 4, when the channel \nis low-attenuation and the spatial densities of femtocells are \nhigh, we observe that for any given value of \uf072F, the spatial \nthroughput decreases with the increase of NF. For larger values \nof NF, the spatial throughput decreases with \uf072F when \uf072F goes \nbeyond a certain value. \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nFemtocell transmit probability per RB (\u03c1F)\nO\nut\nag\ne \npr\nob\nab\nilit\ny\n \n \nMacro (NF=50)\nFemto (NF=50)\nMacro (NF=100)\nFemto (NF=100)\nMacro (NF=200)\nFemto (NF=200)\n \nFig. 1  Outage probability vs. \uf072F, for \uf066 = 5 dB, \uf061FF = 4, and rM = 1000 m. \n \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nFemtocell transmit probability per RB (\u03c1F)\nO\nut\nag\ne \npr\nob\nab\nilit\ny\n \n \nMacro (NF=50)\nFemto (NF=50)\nMacro (NF=100)\nFemto (NF=100)\nMacro (NF=200)\nFemto (NF=200)\n \nFig. 2  Outage probability vs. \uf072F, for \uf066 = 2 dB, \uf061FF = 3.5, and rM = 300 m. \n \nFig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the throughput per cell versus \uf072F, \nunder the same conditions of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. \nBoth figures show that the throughput per macrocell decreases \nas \uf072F increases, while the throughput per femtocell increases \nwith the increase of \uf072F. This confirms that as each femtocell is \nallowed to access only a reduced fraction of available RBs, the \nfemto-to-macro interference is reduced and the throughput per \nmacrocell increases. However, if the number of accessible RBs \nper transmission interval is made too small for each femtocell, \nthe throughput per femtocell becomes unsatisfactory. For both \nmacrocell and femtocells, the throughput per cell decreases \nwith the increase of NF. In order to maintain a specific \nthroughput per macrocell, a reduced \uf072F has to be used for a \nlarger NF. By comparing Fig. 6 with Fig. 5, we can see that the \nthroughput per cell is significantly reduced under a lower-\nattenuation channel and higher spatial densities of femtocells, \nindicating its sensitivity to the radio propagation channel and \nthe density of femtocells. \nFig. 7 and Fig. 8 plot the ASE versus \uf072F, under the same \nconditions as in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. Fig. 7 shows \nthat the ASE of the hybrid macro\/femto network increases with \nthe increase of \uf072F and NF, under a high-attenuation channel and \nwith low spatial densities of femtocells. In Fig. 8, when the \nchannel is low-attenuation and the femtocell densities are high, \nwe can see that for large values of \uf072F, the ASE decreases with \nthe increase of NF, indicating that employing more femtocells \ndoes not improve spatial reuse. For NF \uf0b3 200, the ASE stops \nincreasing with \uf072F when \uf072F goes beyond a certain value. \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n4.5\n5\nx 10\u22125\nFemtocell transmit probability per RB (\u03c1F)\nSp\nat\nia\nl t\nhr\nou\ngh\npu\nt\n \n \nNF=50\nNF=100\nNF=200\n \nFig. 3  Spatial throughput vs. \uf072F, for \uf066 = 5 dB, \uf061FF = 4, and rM = 1000 m. \n \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nx 10\u22125\nFemtocell transmit probability per RB (\u03c1F)\nSp\nat\nia\nl t\nhr\nou\ngh\npu\nt\n \n \nNF = 50\nNF = 100\nNF = 200\n \nFig. 4  Spatial Throughput vs. \uf072F, for \uf066 = 2 dB, \uf061FF = 3.5, and rM = 300 m. \n \nV. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper, we have proposed a decentralized resource \nallocation scheme for the OFDMA downlink of a shared-\nspectrum hybrid macro\/femto network. Simulation results have \nshown that by restricting each femtocell to access only a \nrandomly selected subset of the available RBs per transmission \ntime interval, decentralized inter-cell interference avoidance \ncan be achieved. In order to maintain a spcific performance per \ncell or network-wide, each femtocell may have to access a \ndecreasing fraction of the available RBs with an increasing \n 5\nfemtocell density. Furthermore, the appropriate design of the \ndecentralized resource allocation scheme for a macro\/femto \nnetwork needs to account the spatial intensity of femtocells and \nindoor\/outdoor radio propagation characteristics. \n \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nFemtocell transmit probability per RB (\u03c1F)\nTh\nro\nug\nhp\nut\n p\ner\n c\nel\nl (b\n\/s\/\nHz\n)\n \n \nMacro (NF=50)\nFemto (NF=50)\nMacro (NF=100)\nFemto (NF=100)\nMacro (NF=200)\nFemto (NF=200)\n \nFig. 5  Throughput per cell vs. \uf072F, for \uf066 = 5 dB, \uf061FF = 4, and rM = 1000 m. \n \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n2\nFemtocell transmit probability per RB (\u03c1F)\nTh\nro\nug\nhp\nut\n p\ner\n c\nel\nl (b\n\/s\/\nHz\n)\n \n \nMacro (NF=50)\nFemto (NF=50)\nMacro (NF=100)\nFemto (NF=100)\nMacro (NF=200)\nFemto (NF=200)\n \nFig. 6  Throughput per cell vs. \uf072F, for \uf066 = 2 dB, \uf061FF = 3.5, and rM = 300 m. \n \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nx 10\u22124\nFemtocell transmit probability per RB (\u03c1F)\nAr\nea\nl s\npe\nct\nra\nl e\nffi\ncie\nnc\ny \n(b\/\ns\/H\nz\/m\n2 )\n \n \nNF=50\nNF=100\nNF=200\n \nFig. 7  ASE vs. \uf072F, for \uf066 = 5 dB, \uf061FF = 4, and rM = 1000 m. \n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\nx 10\u22124\nFemtocell transmit probability per RB (\u03c1F)\nAr\nea\nl s\npe\nct\nra\nl e\nffi\ncie\nnc\ny \n(b\/\ns\/H\nz\/m\n2 )\n \n \nNF = 50\nNF = 100\nNF = 200\n \nFig. 8  ASE vs. \uf072F, for \uf066 = 2 dB, \uf061FF = 3.5, and rM = 300 m. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] S.
