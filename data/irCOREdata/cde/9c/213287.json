When opposition to his\ndictatorship was gathering internally and externally, the success of that propaganda\nexercise contributed significantly to a consolidation of his domestic support. Most\nimportantly, it provided a flimsy justification for the Western Powers, anxious to\nincorporate Franco into the anti-Communist front of the Cold War, to forget about\nhis innumerable hostile acts of word and deed in the course of the Second World\nWar. Those acts \u2014 the devotion of the Spanish press to the Axis cause, the refuelling\nand supplying of U-boats, the provision of radar, air reconnaissance and espionage\nfacilities within Spain, the export of valuable raw materials to the Third Reich -\nalthough diminished by the spring of 1944, were never entirely halted until the end\nof the war.\nIn the final days of the Second World War, Franco was still nurturing secret\nhopes of Hitler's wonder weapons turning the tide in favour of the Third Reich,\nbelieving that Nazi scientists had harnessed the power of cosmic rays.2 Indeed, as\nAllied forces stumbled across the horrendous sights of the extermination camps, the\nBritish at Belsen, the Americans at Buchenwald and the Russians at Auschwitz, the\nFrancoist press played down the horrors of the Holocaust as the entirely unavoid-\nable and comprehensible consequence of wartime disorganisation.3 When Berlin\nfell, the press printed tributes to the inspirational presence of Hitler in the city's\n1\n See, inter alia, Jose Maria Sanchez Silva and Jose Luis Saenz de Heredia, Franco . . . ese hombre\n(Madrid: Difusion Librera, 1975), 139.

Informaciones\ndeclared that Hitler had preferred to sacrifice himself for Europe rather than unleash\nhis secret weapons. Allied victory was seen as the triumph of materialism over\nheroism.4 Franco did not break off diplomatic relations with the Third Reich until\n8 May, VE Day. Only at that time were the swastikas removed from the embassy\nbuilding which was duly sealed.5\nWith agile footwork, Franco's controlled press quickly sidestepped any sadness at\nthe passing of Hitler and greeted the end of the war in Europe with the most\nextreme eulogies to the Caudillo for the wisdom and firmness which had enabled\nhim to bestow the gift of peace upon Spain. According to Arriba, the end of the war\nwas 'Franco's Victory'. ABC carried a front-page picture of the Caudillo with the\nstatement: 'he appears to have been chosen by the benevolence of God. When\neverything was obscure, he saw clearly . . . and sustained and defended Spain's\nneutrality.'6 Franco was now able to devote his entire effort to regularising his\nposition with the victorious Allies. In the context of the Cold War, that process was\nto be much easier than even Franco, the eternal optimist, had anticipated. In fact,\nwith barely disguised self-interest, politicians and publicists had been contributing\nto the myth of Franco the man of peace for the previous twelve months.\nIn a speech in the House of Commons on 24 May 1944, Winston Churchill had\nshocked many in both Britain and America with a lavish declaration of his gratitude\nto the Spanish government for keeping out of the war in 1940. He was even more\nfulsome in his praise for the fact that Spain had refrained from interference during\nthe preparations for Operation Torch. The key to his intentions was in his comment\nthat 'Internal political problems in Spain are a matter for the Spaniards themselves'.7\nIt is very likely that Churchill's words were based on motives other than distinter-\nested admiration for Franco. On the one hand, he was trying, in the short term, to\nneutralise Spain during the forthcoming Normandy landings. On the other, there\nwas the longer term purpose of sanitising Franco in order to be able to use him as a\nfuture bulwark of Western Mediterranean policy. At the time, however, there was\nconsiderable furore in English and American political circles and dismay within the\nanti-Franco opposition as an immediate consequence of the speech, not least because\nof the reaction of the Spanish press. Churchill's words were presented by the\nMadrid propaganda machine as a full-scale endorsement both of Franco's foreign\npolicy and of his regime.8 Churchill's speech did Franco and his regime enormous\ngood domestically and internationally. Churchill felt obliged to write, in justi-\nfication, to Roosevelt, 'I do not care about Franco but I do not wish to have the\nIberian Peninsula hostile to the British after the war . . . I do not know whether there\n4\n Arriba, 3, 5, 10 May 1945; ABC, 3, 11 May 1945; Informaciones, 3, 7 May 1945.\n5\n The Times, 11 May 1945.\n6\n Arriba, 8 May 1945; ABC, 8 May 1945.\n7\n Winston S.

I have no intention to seek\na quarrel with either.'9\nSecond only to Churchill's contribution to Franco's efforts to rewrite history was\nthat made by the United Press in the winter of 1944. Massive world-wide publicity\nwas given in November 1944 to the Caudillo's claim to have been the Allies' secret\nfriend throughout the war. Franco was permitted to make a virtuoso display of the\nmost hard-faced cynicism in an interview with the Director of the United Press\nForeign Service, A. L. Bradford. The sympathy with which Franco's declarations\nwere treated was not unconnected with the fact that, at the same time, the official\nSpanish news agency EFE negotiated a contract with the United Press for its services\nin Spain.10 The interview was published on 7 November 1944 and widely repro-\nduced. His declarations were a disingenuous, not to say entirely mendacious,\naccount of his policy during the previous five years. Forgetting his seizure of\nTangier and his appeals to Hitler for the dismemberment of French Morocco at the\ntime of the defeat of France in 1940, he described his attitude to France as one of\nfriendship and hidalguia (nobility). His most outlandish statement was that the\nsending of the Spanish Division Azul to fight in Russia 'implied no idea of conquest\nor passion against any country'. A delirious Spanish press responded with reports\nof the 'universal expectation' and awed admiration with which the world had\nperceived the 'transcendental importance' of Franco's remarks. According to Ya.\nthese 'important declarations have been universally considered as one of the most\nimportant events of recent times'.11\nThereafter, Franco's services to Spain and the Allies as the man who held back the\nNazi hordes became a constant refrain of his propaganda. The central plank in the\nconstruction of that image was his one direct confrontation with the Fiihrer, at\nHendaye on the Spanish\u2014French border, on 23 October 1940. At that meeting, he\nwas alleged brilliantly to have kept a threatening Hitler at arm's length. In fact, an\nexamination of the encounter does nothing to suggest inordinate pressure for\nSpanish belligerence on the part of Hitler. Nor does it diminish the conclusion that\nFranco remained as anxious in the autumn of 1940 as he had been in the early\nsummer, to be part of a future Axis world order. Hitler went to the south of France\nin order to weigh up the respective costs of securing the collaboration in his\nEuropean block of Vichy France and of Franco's Spain. He saw Laval at Montoire-\nsur-Loire, a remote village railway station near Tours, on Tuesday 22 October,\nFranco on the Wednesday at Hendaye and Petain on the Thursday again at\nMontoire. Franco went to Hendaye in order to derive profit from what he saw as\nthe demise of the Anglo-French hegemony which had kept Spain in a subordinate\nposition for over two centuries. The Hendaye meeting failed because Hitler believed\nthat Vichy offered the better deal.\n9\n Churchill to Roosevelt, 4 June 1944, Churchill and Roosevelt: The Complete Correspondence, ed.\nWarren F.

Franco aspired to take\npart in the war but, aware of Spain's economic weakness, only after the worst of the\nfighting was over, albeit before the division of the spoils. In the consequent\nhesitations, there was therefore both prudence and caution. What cannot be\ndiscerned is the perspicacity on the part of the Caudillo to act as the 'secret ally' of\nthe democracies.12 That is not to say that he was not starting to hedge his bets in\nOctober 1940. Nevertheless, until near the end of the war, Franco hardly ever\nwavered in his conviction that the ultimate victor would be the Third Reich. Prior\nto Churchill's speech of May 1944, the Caudillo believed that the future survival of\nhis regime would be seriously endangered by an Allied victory. Rather than any\ndivinely inspired foresight, two other factors imposed inaction on Franco. On the\none hand, the economic and military weakness of Spain, and the power of the Allies\nto control her food and fuel supplies, prevented anything but a war effort lasting a\nfew days. On the other, the Hendaye\u2014Montoire window-shopping expedition\nwould convince Hitler that he could not pay Franco's price.\nWhen the defeat of France was imminent, Franco had made his most blatant\neffort to gain access to what he imagined would be the peace conference to divide up\nthe French empire. This took the form of a letter to Hitler written in early June and\ngiven to Hitler by General Juan Vigon on 16 June.13 That was brushed aside\nungraciously by the Germans. By September 1940, Franco's position had changed\nlittle. Confident of an early German victory over Britain, he had sent his brother-\nin-law and Minister of the Interior, Ramon Serrano Suiter, to Berlin to clinch the\nconditions for Spain to be represented at the final conference table. As the winter\nwore on, the situation was to change slowly as a consequence of three factors. In the\nfirst place, Franco would be taken aback by the fact that, far from placing a high\nvalue on Spanish participation, the Germans were off-hand and dismissive of his\nterritorial aspirations, made demands on Spain for military bases, and continually\nfailed to meet any of his requests for supplies. More importantly, the Caudillo's\nslowly dawning cognizance of the strength of British resistance would gradually\nreactivate his deep-seated fears of a retaliatory strike against Spain or her overseas\nterritories. Resentment of the Germans and fear of the British would take their toll\nof the Caudillo's warlike fervour. Finally, the decisive obstacle to precipitate warlike\naction was the rapid deterioration of Spain's economic position, which would bring\n12\n See Willard L. Beaulac, Franco: Silent Ally in World War II (Carbondale: Southern Illinois\nUniversity Press, 1986), passim. Beaulac was a senior US embassy official in Madrid during the war.

D. Vol. ix (London: Her\nMajesty's Stationery Office, 1956), 509-10. Thereafter DGFP.\nFranco and Hitler 5\nwith it an ever greater vulnerability to Anglo\u2014American pressures and bland-\nishments.\nNevertheless, had Hitler been sufficiently determined to secure Spanish bel-\nligerence, he might well have pulled Franco into the war on his side. It would have\nrequired massive deliveries of food and military equipment and extravagant\npromises of imperial spoils at the expense of France. As things were to turn out, the\nFiihrer would be inhibited from making the necessary promises to Franco for fear of\nthe French finding out. Overwhelming evidence that Spain would be an economic\nand military liability convinced Hitler that it was simply not worth the risk of\nalienating Vichy to gain Spanish belligerence. Accordingly, Serrano Suner's mission\nin September 1940 was not a success. Presenting the list of items which Spain\nrequired, he informed Ribbentrop of her determination to acquire all of French\nMorocco which 'belonged to Spain's Lebensraum' and the area around Oran\ninhabited by Spaniards. Perhaps in an attempt to establish Spain's credentials as a\nruthless member of the Axis club, he also blatantly stated Spain's ambitions with\nregard to Portugal. 'Geographically speaking', he said, 'Portugal really had no right\nto exist.'14 Ribbentrop not only did not agree but astonished Serrano Sufier with his\nown set of counter demands.\nSerrano Sufier and Ribbentrop quickly developed an intense mutual dislike, and\nthis was to have great significance in terms of Spain's ultimate neutrality. The\nrelentless harshness and affectation of the German minister helped to curtail the\nSpaniard's natural impetuosity and fervour for the Axis cause. In his meeting with\nSerrano Suner on 16 September, Ribbentrop quibbled over the amounts of material\nrequested by Spain but finally agreed that she would receive what was absolutely\nnecessary to her. What Germany wanted in return was stated quite brutally.\nRibbentrop's revelation of the abyss which separated Franco and Hitler in their\nvaluation of Spanish belligerence was startling for Serrano Suner. What he learned\non his trip, when it sank in, was significantly to alter his attitude to the Third Reich\nand the whole question of Spain entering the war. Aware that the British would\nrespond to the seizure of Gibraltar by taking the Canary Islands, the Azores or the\nCape Verde Islands, the Fiihrer wanted one of the Canary Islands for a German base,\nand further bases at Agadir and Mogador with 'appropriate hinterland'. He also\ndemanded substantial economic concessions in terms of Civil War debt repayment\nand participation in mining interests in Morocco. Serrano Suner had come\nexpecting to be treated as a valued ally and instead he was being treated as the\nrepresentative of a satellite state.15\nThe idea that it was Serrano Sufier who was the pro-Axis warmonger and Franco\nthe careful pacifist is demolished by the letters which the Caudillo sent to his\nbrother-in-law during his stay in Berlin. There could be no doubt that, at the time,\n14\n Record of conversation between Ribbentrop and Serrano Sufier, Entre Hendaya y Gibraltar\n(Madrid: Ediciones y Publicaciones Espanolas, 1947), 165-71. Thereafter Serrano Suner, Entre Hendaya\ny Gibraltar.\n15\n Record of conversation between Ribbentrop and Serrano Suner, 16 Sept. 1940, DGFP, Ser. D.\nxi, 87-91.\n6 Contemporary European History\nFranco not only believed blindly in the victory of the Axis but he was fully decided\nto join in the war at its side. Any doubts concerned only the material conditions for\nSpanish preparation and future prizes. In the letter sent on 21 September, for\ninstance, the Caudillo oozes confidence that Hitler would see Spain's point of view.\nFranco was clearly delighted with Serrano Suner's meetings so far, 'in every respect,\na beneficial contact'. The Caudillo's tone was of wide-eyed adulation of Hitler.\n'One appreciates as always the lofty vision and the good sense of the Fiihrer'. The\ndisagreeable demands made on Serrano were put down to 'the selfishness and\ninflated self-regard of the Fiihrer's underlings' and to the fact that Ribbentrop and\nHitler's economic advisers failed to see how the Spanish Civil War had facilitated\nGermany's victory over France.16\nWhile Serrano Sufier was still in Germany, Franco's enthusiasm dimmed some-\nwhat. It is not entirely clear if this was as consequence of the full scale of Germany's\neconomic demands which had been carried to him by Colonel Tomas Garcia\nFigueras, or if he had finally heard about the German decision to postpone the attack\non England. He certainly seems to have had evidence that it was now going to be a\nlong war.17 The result of his thoughts was a further letter to Serrano Suner whose\ntone, while in no way suggesting a change in the underlying commitment to the\nAxis, was altogether less sanguine than Franco had been in the immediately\npreceding days. 'There is no doubt about the alliance. It is fully expressed in my\nanswer to the Fiihrer and in the whole direction of our policy since our Civil War'\n(underlined by Franco in the original). However, Franco now showed real concern\nabout the prospect of a protracted war. Moreover, he was adamant in a way he had\nnot been before about the need for adequate economic and military preparation.\nThe scale of assistance required by Spain meant that 'it is necessary to enshrine the\nfuture in a protocol and, although there are no doubts about our decision, we must\nthink about the specific details of the agreement and the obligations to be under-\ntaken by both parties'. The Pact with the Axis should remain secret until Madrid felt\nit was ready for war.18\nFranco's policy had always been based on a determination to enter the war as near\nas possible to the end. However, British resistance was making that moment even\nmore difficult to predict. In addition to evidence about German doubts, opposition\nwas building up within the higher reaches of the Spanish army to entry into the\nwar. The General Staff reported that the navy had no fuel, that there was no air\nforce worthy of the name and no effective mechanised units, and that after the Civil\nWar, the population would not tolerate more sacrifices. With tensions brewing\nbetween monarchists and Falangists, as a compromise solution, Franco latched onto\nthe idea of the secret protocol with the Axis, which he hoped would guarantee his\nterritorial ambitions yet still leave the precise date of Spanish entry to him.\n16\n Franco to Serrano Suner, 21 Sept. 1940, Serrano Suner, Memorias, 331-40; Serrano Suner Entre\nHendaya y Gibraltar, 183.\n17\n Ramon Serrano Suner, De anteayer y de hoy (Barcelona: Plaza y Janes, 1981), 214. Thereafter\nSerrano Sufier, De anteayer.\n18\n Franco to Serrano Suner, 24 Sept. 1940, Serrano Suner, Memorias, 342-8.\nFranco and Hitler 7\nHowever, the question of the date was never resolved because Hitler was neither\nable nor inclined to pay the Caudillo's double price of the prior German financing\nof Spanish military and economic preparation and the transfer to Spain of French\nNorth Africa. The harsh demands made by Hitler and Ribbentrop in their meetings\nwith Serrano Suner in Berlin on 16, 17, 24 and 25 September triggered Franco's\ninclination to enter the war only if he was paid in advance. It was, nevertheless, not\nuntil the postponment of Operation Sealion that the Caudillo realised that the war\nwas going to be a long one.\nAfter reading a letter from Franco dated 22 September, Hitler and Serrano Suner\nagreed that the various outstanding points of the negotiations should now be left\nuntil the Fiihrer's forthcoming meeting with the Caudillo. Before that happened,\nthe Fiihrer saw Mussolini at the Brenner on 4 October. Hitler made clear his fears\nthat, if the French discovered that he was talking to Franco about handing their\nAfrican territories to Spain, then they would simply abandon defence of their pos-\nsessions or else French local forces in Africa would break away from Vichy. In the\nwake of their successful defence of Dakar, he was determined to do nothing to\npersuade the Vichy French to abandon the defence of their empire against the British.\nHe was inclining to resolve the contradictions between Spanish ambitions and French\nsensibilities by offering the French British territory in Nigeria in return for their\ngranting part of Morocco to Spain. If that were not possible, Hitler believed that an\nattack on Gibraltar was feasible without Spanish agreement. In any case, the seizure\nof Gibraltar was considered by the Germans to be secondary to the capture of Suez.\nIf it took place before Suez was safely in Axis hands, it would merely provoke an\nEnglish assault on the Canary Islands.19\nWhen Franco realised that Ribbentrop's views merely aped those of Hitler, he\nwas taken aback by what he saw as the Fiihrer's rapaciousness, albeit not quite so\nmuch as his brother-in-law who deeply resented the attitude and ill manners of\nRibbentrop. In fact, the Caudillo remained excited about the prospect of securing\nFrench Morocco for Spain. The hopes nurtured by the Caudillo explain why it was\nthat he was so slow to draw the logical conclusion that he should be extremely\ncareful with Hitler. He preferred to cling to the consoling idea that the Fiihrer's\nvision, understanding and generosity were being undermined by the meanness of\nhis subordinates. What is most striking about his views on the war and his attitude\nto Hitler in the autumn and winter of 1940 is their remarkable combination of\nprovincial mediocrity and a complacency bordering on megalomania.\nFranco's continued fervour for the Third Reich was revealed dramatically in the\nremoval of the two most pro-Allied ministers in his cabinet re-organisation of 16\nOctober 1940. Luis Alarcon de la Lastra was replaced as Minister of Industry and\nCommerce by the wily and unscrupulous Falangist businessman Demetrio Carceller\nSegura. Colonel Juan Beigbeder was replaced as Minister of Foreign Affairs by\nSerrano Suner.

On the other hand I do not feel that the internal economic situation has\nimproved. Again I express my conviction that Spanish non-belligerence is more advan-\ntageous to us than her intervention. We ought to keep intervention as a reserve: it is a card\nthat we ought to play at the most opportune moment according to the given circumstances,\nsuch as prolongation of the war through 1941 or an overt intervention by the United States.\nMeanwhile, Spain will have the necessary time to prepare herself.20\nAs it turned out, earlier Spanish promises to join the Axis were reiterated but not\nconverted into tightly binding contractual commitments at the historic meeting\nbetween Hitler and Franco at Hendaye on Wednesday 23 October 1940. That is not\nentirely surprising. Despite the creation of the myth of Franco gallantly holding out\nagainst the threats of the Fiihrer, Hitler had not in fact come to demand of Franco\nthat Spain go to war immediately. Indeed, there was more of an exploratory\nelement to his journey. He was engaged in his 'grandiose fraud', seeing Laval on 22\nOctober at Montoire-sur-Loire, a remote village railway station near Tours, en\nroute to his meeting with Franco and then Petain on 24 October again at Montoire\non his way back. The Fiihrer was preoccupied with the anxiety that Mussolini was\nabout to get involved in a protracted and inconvenient Balkan war by attacking\nGreece. He was also coming round to the view that to hand French Morocco over\nto the Spaniards was to make them vulnerable to British attack. He inclined to the\nconclusion, which he was to confide to Mussolini in Florence on 28 October, that\nthe best solution was for the French to be left to defend French Morocco. The\nHendaye and Montoire trip was a reconnaissance to see if there was a way to make\nthe aspirations of Franco and Petain compatible and to help him decide his future\nstrategy in south-western Europe.21 The memory of the Vichy success against the\nDakar expedition could be perceived in Hitler's remark to Franco at Hendaye that\nSpanish desires and French hopes were the obstacles to his aspiration of a great\nanti-British front consisting of Germany, Italy, Spain and Vichy France. At the\nsame time, the Fiihrer was no doubt aware of the views of his Commander-in-Chief\nBrauchitsch and his Chief of Staff Haider, that 'Spain's domestic situation is so\nrotten as to make her useless as a political partner. We shall have to achieve the\nobjectives essential to us (Gibraltar) without her active participation.'22\nFranco, who had to travel only a few kilometers, arrived shortly after 3.00 pm,\neight minutes late and to the contempt of the assembled Germans, his train\nshuddered into the station. According to the German Foreign Ministry official Dr\nPaul Schmidt, the train was one hour late, although there is nothing to substantiate\nthat assertion in reports at the time nor in the several accounts of Serrano Suner.

In fact, Franco was infuriated by the small delay that\nhis train suffered. Feeling that he was being diminished in the eyes of Hitler, he\nthreatened to sack the lieutenant-colonel responsible for organising his travel\narrangements.24 Marshal Keitel noticed that the rifles of the Spanish guard of\nhonour were so rusty as to be totally unusuable. After the meeting, when Franco's\ntrain finally drew off, it jolted so violently that only the intervention of General\nMoscardo prevented Franco tumbling head-first onto the platform. It rained on the\nway back to San Sebastian, and in the aged train once used by Alfonso XIII, known\nas the 'break de Obras Publicas', water leaked onto Franco and Serrano Sufier.25\nSubstantial photographic evidence suggests that Franco was thrilled to be\nmeeting the Fiihrer and to be able to thank him in person for German aid given\nduring the Civil War. It was surely understandable that Franco's eyes should glisten\nwith emotion since the meeting constituted an intensely historic moment. It does,\nhowever, belie the view that Franco was skilfully deceiving Hitler. In the words of\nhis hagiographers, 'the skill of one man held back what all the armies of Europe,\nincluding the French, had been unable to do'.26 The dewy-eyed look reflected in the\nphotographs is not one which is easily simulated, particularly for as cold a fish as\nFranco. The meeting between Franco and Serrano Sufier, together with the Foreign\nMinistry interpreter the Baron de las Torres, and Hitler, Ribbentrop and the\nGerman interpreter Gross, took place in the parlour coach of the Fiihrer's special\ntrain Erika from 3.30 pm to 6.05 pm. Between 6.30 and 7.00, Serrano Sufier and\nRibbentrop met again separately. Around 8.00, the party had dinner in Hitler's\ncoach.\nAn entirely accurate, minutely detailed, reconstruction of the Hendaye meeting\nis impossible despite the existence of several ostensibly eye-witness accounts. Six\npeople were present; Hitler, Franco, Ribbentrop, Serrano Sufier and the two\ninterpreters. A seventh, Paul Schmidt of Ribbentrop's staff, was hovering in the\nbackground. Four of the seven, Serrano Sufier, the Baron de las Torres, Luis\nAlvarez de Estrada y Luque (the Spanish interpreter), Ribbentrop and Schmidt,\nhave left accounts of varying degrees of detail.27 The fullest version is contained in\nthe German Foreign Office record, which is inexplicably incomplete (just as other\n23\n Paul Schmidt , Hitler's Interpreter: The Secret History of German Diplomacy 1935-1945 (London:\nHeinemann, 1951), 193.

(Puebla, Mexico: Editorial Cajica, 1970), 209-17.\nio Contemporary European History\ndocuments concerning the relations between Hitler and Franco are inexplicably\nmissing). The account is plausibly attributed in the German documents to Paul\nSchmidt, who was certainly among the German party at Hendaye. According to\nboth Serrano Sufier and the Spanish interpreter, the Baron de las Torres, Schmidt\nwas not present in the railway carriage for the meeting, although he entered at the\nend. Schmidt's own tantalisingly brief account is compatible with the surviving\nfragment of the official German record, and it tallies closely with the slight\nreferences in Ribbentrop's memoirs. Even if he was not present, it may safely be\nassumed either that he was listening just outside or that he was briefed immediately\nafterwards by the German Foreign Minister.28 Serrano Sufier asserted to the author\nthat Schmidt distorted his account in favour of Franco in order to improve his own\nchances of survival after 1945 by ensuring asylum for himself in Spain.\nSerrano Sufier gives an immensely revealing, albeit not entirely disinterested,\naccount in his memoirs.29 The Baron de las Torres wrote notes, which are dated 26\nOctober 1940 and were printed in full in the Spanish press in 1989.30 These and\nother notes by de las Torres were used by Serrano Sufier in his memoirs.31\nHowever, neither the tone nor the detailed content of de las Torres' account is\nconvincing. References to the virility, patriotism and realism with which Franco\nresisted Hitler's pressure are more redolent of the post-1945 propaganda exercise in\nre-writing the Caudillo's role in the war. The document makes a number of\ncontradictory claims. The Fiihrer is alleged, in the course of surveying the military\nsituation in Europe, to have made the following threat: 'I am the master of Europe,\nand, as I have 200 divisions at my orders, there is no alternative but to obey.' In the\nsurviving section of the German record, Hitler's survey of the European situation is\nindeed printed, complete with a discussion of his available divisions, but there is\nnothing resembling the threat alleged in this account. According to de las Torres,\nHitler left the meeting muttering either 'with these fellows [or this fellow], there is\nnothing to be done' ('mit diesem Kerl [or 'diesen Kerlen'] ist nichts zu machen').32\nClearly, had Hitler seriously been threatening to use 200 divisions against Spain, he\nwould hardly have made a remark so redolent of impotence. If the threat was never\nissued, then the annoyance becomes altogether comprehensible.

This is totally\nuntenable given what is known about Spanish ambitions in the area and Franco's\npressure on Vichy in precisely that direction during the preceding months.33 The\nproduction of this document, when taken together with the mysterious dis-\nappearance of other relevant documents from the Auswartiges Amt, makes most\nsense in the context of a propaganda exercise.34\nTo Franco's gushing greeting 'I am happy to see you, Fiihrer', Hitler replied\ncoolly, 'Finally, an old wish of mine is fulfilled, Caudillo.' However, rather than the\nconversation which Hitler might have expected to dominate, there were obliquely\nopposing monologues. Curiously, in the light of the unprepossessing image pre-\nsented by Franco, Hitler seems to have been on the defensive, rambling around the\npoint and indulging in a frantic justification of Germany's present difficulties in the\nwar, with particular emphasis on the role of the weather in the Battle of Britain. He\nalso explained laboriously and rather obscurely why the fulfilment of Spain's\nMoroccan ambitions was problematic given the need for the co-operation of the\nVichy French. In this regard, he referred to his conversation on the day before with\nLaval and his forthcoming encounter with Petain, in which his theme was that, if\nFrance came in with Germany, then her territorial losses could be compensated with\nBritish colonies. The bitter pill for Franco was Hitler's statement that, 'If co-\noperation with France proved possible, then the territorial results of the war might\nperhaps not be so great. Yet the risk was smaller and success more readily\nobtainable. In his personal view it was better in so severe a struggle to aim at a quick\nsuccess in a short time, even if the gain would be smaller than to wage long\ndrawn-out wars. If with France's aid Germany could win faster, she was ready to\ngive France easier peace terms in return.'\nFranco can hardly have failed to notice that his hopes of massive territorial gain at\nvirtually no cost were being slashed before his eyes. He had gone into the meeting\nnaively convinced that Hitler, his friend, would be generous. Accordingly, he tried\nto overwhelm him, in a monotonous sing-song voice, with a recital of the history of\nSpanish claims in Morocco, the current appalling conditions in Spain, a list of\nsupplies required to facilitate her military preparations and a pompous assertion that\nSpain could take Gibraltar alone. Hitler was driven to distraction by Franco's\ninsistent, droning voice and his relentless imperturbability. He was especially\ninfuriated when Franco repeated an opinion which he acquired from his naval\nattache in Rome, Captain Alvaro Espinosa de los Monteros, to the effect that, even\nif England were conquered, the British government and fleet would continue to\nfight the war from Canada with American support. The Fiihrer jumped nervously\nto his feet, barking that there was no point in further discussion.

The two foreign\nministers were then left to draw up a protocol.36 It was significant that, in the\nconversation between Serrano Suner and Ribbentrop which followed, the Cunadi-\nsimo 'noted at the outset that the Caudillo had not exactly understood the concrete\nquestions dealt with in the conversations with the Fiihrer'. In particular, he could\nnot bring himself to accept that Hitler wished to collaborate with Petain whom the\nCaudillo saw as finished.37 He was not entirely bewildered, however. When Hitler\npushed for the early publication of the Tripartite Pact, Franco had countered that to\ndo so would be to provoke an English landing in Portugal. Serrano Suner expressed\nto Ribbentrop his surprise at Hitler's new line with regard to French Africa and his\nregret that 'this would render void Spain's maximum demands'. None the less,\nconsistent with the earlier proposals of Franco himself, he agreed to a secret\nprotocol. Another Spanish aspiration which was not to be satisfied in the written\nagreement was a claim for a rectification of the Pyrenean frontier to give French\nCatalonia to Spain.38 The document had not been completed when the talks broke\nup. Franco's parting words to the Fiihrer revealed his emotional commitment to the\nAxis: 'Despite what I've said, if the day ever arrived when Germany really needed\nme, she would have me unconditionally at her side without any demands on my\npart.' To the relief of Serrano Suner, the German interpreter did not translate what\nhe took to be merely a formal courtesy.39\nWith an astonishing mixture of naivety and greed, Franco said to Serrano Sufier\nafter the interview, 'These people are intolerable. They want us to come into the\nwar in exchange for nothing. We cannot trust them if they do not undertake, in\nwhatever we sign, a binding, formal contract to grant to us now those territories\nwhich I have explained to them are ours by right. Otherwise, we will not enter the\nwar now. This new sacrifice of ours would only be justified if they reciprocated\nwith what would become the basis of our empire. After the victory, despite what\nthey say, if they do not make a formal commitment now, they will give us\nnothing.'40 What is perhaps most noteworthy about Franco's remarks was their\nimplicit belief that 'a formal commitment' from Hitler would have been worth\nanything. This statement, and indeed the entire tenor of the meeting, make a\nnonsense of the later claim by both Franco and Serrano Sufier that they were\nskilfully holding off Hitler. Their determination was not to hold on to neutrality\nbut to get the basis of a colonial empire. It was their good fortune that Hitler had\nother commitments. Accordingly, neutrality became a kind of consolation prize.\nAfter Franco's accident as the train pulled off, the Spanish party returned to San\n35\n S c h m i d t , Hitler's Interpreter, 196; The Ribbentrop Memoirs ( L o n d o n : Weidenfe ld & Nico l son ,\n' 9 5 4 ) . 3 \u00b0 ; Sana, Franquismo, 190 -3 . ,\n36\n Arriba, 24 O c t . 1940; La Vanguardia Espanola, 24 O c t . 1940. 37 Sana , Franquismo, 191 .\n38\n Ciano's Diplomatic Papers, edi ted b y M a l c o l m M u g g e r i d g e ( L o n d o n : O d h a m s , 1948), 4 0 1 - 2 .\nThereaf te r C i a n o , Papers.\n39\n Se r rano Suner , Memorias, 298. 40 Se r rano Suner , Memorias, 299.\nFranco and Hitler 13\nSebastian. Serrano Suiier and Franco returned to the Palacio de Ayete and worked\non a text of the protocol between 2.00 and 3.00 am. The text prepared in advance by\nthe Germans called upon Spain to join the war when the Reich considered it\nnecessary. They sought in their text to find a less rigid formula which would still\ngive them bargaining room. Before dawn, General Eugenio Espinosa de los\nMonteros, the Spanish Ambassador to Germany, appeared. In view of his account\nof German impatience, the text was sent back to Hendaye in his hands. Ribbentrop\nrefused to accept small amendments to the protocol, although Serrano Sufier kept\nthe news from Franco.41 For all its vagueness, the protocol constituted a formal\nundertaking by Spain to join the war on the Axis side.42\nGoebbels noted in his diary of the Hendaye talks: 'The Fiihrer has now had his\nprojected meeting with Franco. I am informed by telephone that everything went\nsmoothly. According to the information, Spain is firmly ours. Churchill is in for a\nbad time.'43 Goebbels was not alone in receiving such a call. Ribbentrop also\ntelephoned Ciano and expressed satisfaction with the meeting.44 Both of these\ncomments are entirely consistent with the fact that Hitler had been on something of\na reconnaissance trip to compare the stances of Franco and Petain. It was only later\nthat he would come to regard the meeting as an outright failure. However, that is\nnot to say that he had enjoyed the encounter. After spending nine hours intermit-\ntently in Franco's company, Hitler told Mussolini later that 'Rather than go\nthrough that again, I would prefer to have three or four teeth taken out'.45 Clearly\nboth Hitler and Ribbentrop were irritated that Franco and Serrano Suiier seemed\nincapable of appreciating that German interests required that Spanish demands be\nrestrained. According to Field-Marshal Keitel, who spoke briefly to Hitler during\nthe dinner break, 'he was very dissatisfied with the Spaniards' attitude and was all\nfor breaking off the talks there and then. He was very irritated with Franco, and\nparticularly annoyed about the role played by Sufier, his Foreign Secretary; Sufier,\nclaimed Hitler, had Franco in his pocket. In any event, the final result was very\npoor.'46 Similarly, on the drive away from Hendaye, Ribbentrop allegedly cursed\nSerrano Sufier as a 'Jesuit' and Franco as an 'ungrateful coward'.47 Ribbentrop also\nwrote with some exasperation on 25 October to the German Ambassador in Rome,\nMackensen, about the difficulties encountered at Hendaye. He summed them up\nsuccinctly when he said, 'The Spanish Foreign Minister nevertheless frequently\nrevealed a lack of sufficient understanding for the fact that the realization of the\nSpanish aspirations depends exclusively on the military successes of the Axis Powers\nand that therefore these aspirations must be subordinated to the Axis policy of\nattaining final victory'. He complained of the Spaniards' failure to see that they\n41\n Serrano Sufier, Memorias, 300-1; Saiia, Franquismo, 195-8; Espadas, Franquismo, pp. 117-18.

He\nwas, of course, confident of being able to dispose of the French colonial empire as he\nwished but had no intention of giving it to Franco. That was his 'grandiose fraud'.\nSerrano Suner suggested years later that Hitler had not told a sufficiently big lie.\nAccording to the cunadisimo, Franco's Africanista obsession with Morocco was such\nthat, if Hitler had offered it, he would have entered the war.51 Franco himself has\nbeen quoted as telling the Civil Governor of Leon, Antonio Martinez Cattaneo, that\n'it was Hitler who did not accept my conditions'.52 Hitler himself revealed the\nreasons why, for once, he was incapable of dabbling in full-scale untruth while await-\ning the arrival of Franco's train. Chatting with Ribbentrop on the platform at\nHendaye, he remarked that no firm promises of French territory could be given\nbecause, 'with these chattering Latins, the French are sure to hear something about it\nsooner or later. I want to try, in talking to Petain, to induce the French to start active\nhostilities against England, so I cannot now suggest to them such cessions of territory.\nQuite apart from that if such an agreement with the Spaniards became known, the\nFrench colonial empire would probably go over bodily to de Gaulle'.53\nIt was fortunate for Franco that Hitler remained unwilling and indeed unable to\npay his price. After all, one of the Fiihrer's reasons for wanting Spain's participation\nwas to be able to control North Africa and so preclude a build-up of French resistance\nthere. Yet Franco's price of French colonies would almost certainly precipitate an\nanti-German movement under de Gaulle that would pave the way to Allied landings.\nThe Hendaye meeting came to a stalemate precisely on this problem. The protocol\nwas signed, committing Spain to join the Axis cause at a date to be decided by\n'common agreement of the three Powers' but after military preparations were\ncomplete. This effectively left the decision with Franco. Nevertheless, the Fiihrer\ncould have pushed him by beginning deliveries of food and military supplies. Hitler\nmade firm promises concerning only Gibraltar and was imprecise about future\nSpanish control of French colonies in Africa. Curiously, Hitler, who thought of\nhimself as perpetrating a great fraud by not telling Franco that he had no intention\nof giving him the French Empire, failed precisely because his lie was not big enough.\nThe vague promises which were made were not enough for the Caudillo.

The Caudillo's remarks to\nSerrano Sufier reflected his outrage that the Germans were not offering a colonial\nempire in return for Spanish belligerence. Ironcially, that constituted the mirror\nimage of the German view that Franco's indignation over their demand for a\nCanary Island base proved that 'the Spaniards are out only to gain their own ends\nwithout making any sacrifices'.54 As fortunate for Franco as Hitler's insensitive\ndemands was the fact that Ribbentrop's overbearing manner had rubbed up the\nhighly touchy Serrano Sufier the wrong way.\nThere was an element of truth, as well as duplicity, when Serrano Sufier\ninformed the American Ambassador on 31 October 1940, and repeated it three\ntimes, that 'there had been no pressure, not even an insinuation on the part of either\nHitler or Mussolini that Spain should enter the war'.55 Hitler met the Duce in\nFlorence on 28 October, both to recount his conversations with Laval, Franco and\nPetain and to hear the full extent of Mussolini's adventure in Greece. The Fiihrer\nexpressed his fear that if French Morocco broke from Vichy and there was an\nEnglish landing, the Spaniards might not be able to hold on to their existing North\nAfrican possessions. In such a case, the drain on Axis forces would be intolerable and\nit was therefore more sensible to leave the Vichy French to defend Morocco. As he\nbecame more involved in the problem of trying to tempt Laval and Petain into\nsome kind of subordinate alliance with the Axis, Hitler became more critical of\nFranco. With regard to Spanish demands, the Fiihrer told Mussolini that Spain\n'could not get any more than a substantial enlargement of Spanish Morocco' and\nthat the timing of Spanish entry into the war depended on the completion of her\nmilitary preparations. Getting Spain into the war, despite the fantasies of Francoist\npropagandists, was still not an urgent priority for the Fiihrer. In any case, before\nlong the Fiihrer's mind would be turning to Russia.56\nWhat was to change his attitude to Spain was the difficulties that he faced on the\nBalkans as a result of Mussolini's precipitate attack on Greece on 28 October. Hitler\nwas shaken by the British naval victory over the Italians at Taranto and by the turn\nof events in Greece which opened the way to a British offensive in the Balkans.\nOnly after that, and to diminish the risk to Germany's Romanian oil supplies, did\nHitler now decide that he must close the Mediterranean.57 For the first time, he was\nsufficiently keen on Spanish belligerence to force the pace and to put pressure on\nFranco. On 11 November, Ribbentrop invited Serrano Sufier to a meeting with\nhimself and Ciano at the Berghof on 18 November.

The Spanish economic situation was worsening by the day, and he\ntoo had noted the signs of a resurgence of the British position. With Hitler showing\nlittle sign of coming up with the specific undertakings of imperial profits that\nFranco sought, the Caudillo was about to retreat into a more realistic line than\nhitherto, that of postponing Spanish belligerence until British defeat was unmistak-\nably imminent. It is only therefore from mid-November 1940 that it is at all\npossible to speak accurately of Franco 'holding off Hitler's demands. Even then, his\nbelief in, and commitment to, Axis victory were to remain unshaken for another\nthree years.\nRibbentrop to Stohrer, 11 Nov. 1940, DCFP, Ser. D, xi, 513-14; Sana, Franquismo, 203.\n"}
