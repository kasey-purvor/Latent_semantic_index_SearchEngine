Modelling the cardiovascular system (CVS) presents a challenging and important prob-\nlem. The CVS is a complex dynamical system that is vital to the function of the human organism,\nand it reflects numerous different states of health and disease. Its complexity lies in a combination\nof oscillatory modes spanning a wide frequency scale that can synchronize for short episodes of\ntime, coupled with a strong stochastic contribution. Motivated by these properties, we discuss the\nproblem of characterising dynamics when there is a combination of oscillatory components in the\npresence of strong noise and, in particular, where the characteristic frequencies and corresponding\namplitudes vary in time. We show that, where there are several noisy oscillatory modes, the slower\nmodes are difficult to characterise because the length of the recorded time series is inevitably limited\nin real measurements. We argue that, in the case of strong noise combined with a limited observation\ntime, such oscillatory dynamics with several modes may appear to manifest as a 1\n\u0002 f -like behaviour.\nWe also show that methods of time-frequency analysis can provide a basis for characterising noisy\noscillations, but that a straightforward characterisation of multi-scale oscillatory dynamics in the\npresence of strong noise still remains an unsolved problem.\nINTRODUCTION\nNature abounds with rhythms of diverse origin. The day and the night rhythmically ex-\nchange, influencing the rhythmicity of light- and temperature-dependent physiological\nprocesses. But natural clocks seem to be adaptive. As the length and intensity of the day-\nlight change within a year, the basic frequencies of many natural rhythms are modulated\nand thus vary in time.\nOne of the most vital rhythmical functions for humans, and for higher animals gener-\nally, is the beating of the heart. The heart is a part of the cardiovascular system (CVS)\nwhich serves to keep the blood in continuous motion. The CVS rhythmically distributes\nnutrients and oxygen to every cell and takes away the products of their metabolism. It\nconsists of the heart, lung, and a network of contractile vessels that are actively involved\nin the regulation of blood pressure and blood flow. The flow of blood is regulated with\nrespect to the needs of each cell of the body, as well as to the spontaneous fluctuations\narising from naturally occurring perturbations to the CVS. Thus the heart frequency is\nnot constant, but varies within certain limits, adapting to the current state and needs of\nthe organism.\nThe CVS is an extremely complex system, and it reflects the different states of health\nor disease. How best to parameterize CVS dynamics using appropriate cardiovascular\nsignals, measured noninvasively, has been a continuing challenge over the last twenty\nyears. In spite of intensive research, an optimal characterization able unambiguously to\ndescribe the dynamics of the CVS, and reliably to distinguish between its states, has yet\nto be found. In particular, we would like to establish a way of detecting changes due to\ndiseases in their early stages, before symptoms become obvious. The characterization\ninvolves two major questions \u2013\n1. How to define the appropriate level of complexity at which the system can best be\ncharacterized and modelled?\n2. What is the underlying dynamics that best characterize its properties?\nThe first problem involves understanding the structure and function of the CVS, i.e.\nthe underlying physiological background. The second problem is usually approached\nthrough the analysis of cardiovascular time series. The recent development of noninva-\nsive sensors based on electrical, optical, and auditory detection of cardiovascular func-\ntions, of powerful computers, and of methods of nonlinear and stochastic time series\nanalysis, has motivated huge interest in understanding the dynamics of the cardiovascu-\nlar system. However, the complex fluctuations which we can observe and measure in the\nblood flow, blood pressure and heart rate, are yet to be understood.\nIt has been established that signals, derived from the human CVS contain several os-\ncillatory components [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], independent of the measurement site and function.\nOn a time scale of around one minute, the dynamics of the blood distribution system can\nbe characterized by five oscillatory components with slowly varying frequencies and\namplitudes [7, 8, 9, 10]. The frequency and amplitude variations are reminiscent of phe-\nnomena observed in coupled oscillators. Moreover, another phenomenon characteristic\nof coupled oscillators was observed \u2013 the synchronization of two of the rhythms: the\ncardiac and respiratory [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. One possibility, therefore, is to charac-\nterize cardiovascular signals in terms of a model consisting of five coupled autonomous\nnoisy oscillators [17, 18].\nThe other approach comes from analyses of the statistical properties of heart rate\nvariability (HRV) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23], and considers the chaotic behaviour [24, 25],\nscaling properties [26, 27, 28] and multifractal characteristics [23] detected in the HRV\nsignal. HRV was considered to result from 1 \u0000 f dynamics and it was suggested that the\nstate of the system defines the scaling properties of the power spectrum of the HRV and\nthat the state can be classified in terms of the slope in the log-log representation of its\npower spectrum.\nWhere, then, is the origin of the difference in these two approaches to CVS dynam-\nics? Is the dynamics primarily oscillatory \u2013 spanning multiple time scales, or is it mainly\nstochastic, or is it a combination? Studies concerned with the stochastic nature of the\nsystem are mainly based on analyses of the HRV signal. Those concerned with its os-\ncillatory nature are based on analyses of blood flow and blood pressure, as well as of\nthe HRV signal. They are motivated by the physiological importance of the local regu-\nlatory mechanisms for blood flow and blood pressure, which manifest as low frequency\noscillations (<0.05 Hz) apparently reflecting the vascular and endothelial immune and\ncytotoxic reactions.\nIn this paper we illustrate problems that arise in the analysis of noisy time-varying os-\ncillations from a finite data set, and we show that they may lead to differences in interpre-\ntation. We first analyze two cardiovascular signals, HRV and blood flow, and then apply\nexactly the same analysis to a model signal whose dynamics is completely known. For il-\nlustration several methods of time series analysis are applied: discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT), time averaged DFT, wavelet transform using the Morlet wavelet, time averaged\nwavelet transform, and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).\nTIME SERIES AND THEIR CHARACTERIZATION\nCardiovascular signals\nIn this section we present analyses of cardiovascular time series. A set of cardiovas-\ncular signals, i.e. the electrical activity of the heart (ECG), respiratory movements of\nthe lung, blood pressure, and peripheral blood flow, was simultaneously recorded from\na healthy, relaxed subject for 30 minutes using the procedure described in [9]. In our\ndiscussion we will consider, first, the HRV \u201csignal\u201d derived from the ECG as an esti-\nmate of the instantaneous cardiac frequency defined between two successive R-peaks\nand, secondly, the skin blood flow signal. The signals were sampled at 400 Hz for pre-\ncise detection of R-peaks. After generation of the HRV, they were resampled to 10 Hz\nfor analysis. The resultant signals are presented in figures 1(a) and 2(a) respectively.\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800\n\u22120.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\ntime, s\n(a)\n0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 1\n0\n0.005\n0.01 (b)\n0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 1\n0\n0.005\n0.01 (c)\n0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 1\n0\n1\n2\n(d)\nfrequency, Hz\n0.010.03 0.1 0.3 1 400\n800\n12000\n5\ntime, s\nfrequency, Hz\n102 103 104\n10\u22121\n100\nL (or time*10, s)\nF D\n(L)\n(e)\n(f)\nFIGURE 1.

However, markedly different interpretations of the very low frequency components\nare possible. One may think of oscillatory components which undergo strong complex\nmodulation by noise and from the rest of the system, or one can study the scaling proper-\nties of the power spectra which can be classified by the \u03b1 coefficient given by detrended\nfluctuation analysis (DFA) [21, 22]. As demonstrated in figures 1(e) and 2(e) both car-\ndiovascular signals manifest 1 \u0000 f -like behavior.\nModel time series\nLet us now consider a Van-der-Pol oscillator using the same methods of analysis.\nFigure 3(a) presents a time series obtained from one oscillator of the system\nx\u00a8i\n\u0001\n\u03b5i\n\u0002\n1 \u0003 x2i \u0004 x\u02d9i\n\u0001\nw2i xi \u0005 Di\u03be \u0002 t \u0004 \u0007 (1)\nwhere xi is the coordinate of the i-th oscillator and \u03be \u0002 t\n\u0004\nis white Gaussian noise of in-\ntensity Di.

L in (g) is the window length.\n(1) possesses a stable periodic orbit (limit cycle) and produces an almost harmonic sig-\nnal for small \u03b5i \u0000 Strong noise applied to the oscillator results in significant variations of\nits instantaneous amplitude and frequency, strikingly similar to the behaviour already\nobserved in cardiovascular signals. In the absence of noise the problem of characterising\nthe dynamics of a single oscillator from time series is of course trivial. Each of the exist-\ning methods, either in phase space, or in the time, frequency, or time-frequency domains,\nreconstructs its properties unambiguously. The addition of strong noise, however, trans-\nforms this trivial problem into one that remains unsolved. Note that the phase portrait\nof the single noisy oscillator can no longer be characterised by a circle and no obvious\norigin can be determined. The DFA then results in a curve that may be interpreted as\n1\/ f -like, although the scaling interval(s) cannot easily be defined. A more precise char-\nacterisation may be attempted by spectral methods, and by time-frequency analysis in\nparticular. Here, however, we face difficulties in frequency determination. The higher\nthe frequency is, the better we are able to define it, as there will be a larger number of\ncycles within the observation period. For the slower oscillations, however, with fewer\ncomplete cycles, the effect of noise is inevitably more pronounced. Note that the choice\nof the window length represents a compromise between time and frequency localisation.\nThe actual window for the wavelet transform in our case was chosen to include 5 periods\nof the corresponding frequency being estimated.\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800\n20\n0\n20\ntime, s\n(a)\n0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 1\n0\n0.5\n1 (b)\n0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 1\n0\n1\n(c)\n0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 1\n0\n100\n200\n(d)\nfrequency, Hz\n0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 1 400\n800\n12000\n500\ntime, s\nfrequency, Hz\n102 103 104\n101\n102\nL (or time*10, s)\nF D\n(L) (e)\n(f)\nFIGURE 4.

The choices of the number of\noscillators, and their frequencies, were motivated by the idea that CVS can be modelled\nas a system of five coupled oscillators, each corresponding to a different CVS activity\n(cardio, respiratory, neurogenic, myogenic and metabolic) [9]. We scale the parameters\nwi, \u03b5i and Di in order to get exactly the same oscillators but acting on different time\nscales. So if k is a scaling factor so that wi \u0000 kw1, then \u03b5i \u0000 k\u03b51 Di \u0000 k2D1 \u0000 The time\nseries in figure 4(a) are obtained as x\n\u0000\n\u2211i xi for parameters \u03b51 \u0000 0 \u0000 4 and D1 \u0000 1000 \u0000\nNote that all five oscillators (1) are identical, so that they produce identical time series\nin a statistical sense, but scaled in time and in frequency. Note also that in reality the\ncardiovascular oscillators are coupled. In our model we use noise to introduce the effect\nof couplings. In this way, although the model is complex, e.g. consists of five modes, we\nare still able to treat it both analytically and numerically.\nSpectral analyses using frequency and time-frequency methods are presented in fig-\nures 4(b)\u20134(e). Note that the wavelet transform has better statistical averaging (averag-\ning in time and frequency domain). However, as already noted, optimal resolution in\ntime and in frequency cannot be obtained simultaneously. The Morlet wavelet allows a\ncompromise with good frequency resolution in the low frequency (LF) domain and a\ngood time resolution in the high frequency (HF) domain. It allows the best estimation\nof the lowest frequency peaks compared to the results obtained by DFT and time aver-\naged DFT. Yet, as can be seen from figure 4, the two spectral peaks lowest in frequency\nare not well resolved in the spectra. That means that the available time of observation,\nwhich is chosen to include about 30 realizations of the slowest oscillation, is insufficient\nfor appropriate estimation of the LF oscillatory components due to poor statistical aver-\naging. Figure 4(e) gives the DFA function of the model signal in 4(a). Again it shows\n1 \u0000 f -like behavior with two different scaling regions. We note that DFA cannot provide\ninformation about the underlying oscillatory dynamics.\nCONCLUSION\nWe have discussed the problem of characterising oscillatory dynamics from time series\nin the presence of strong noise, introduced in such a way as to produce time-variability\nof the characteristic frequencies as observed for the cardiovascular oscillations. Using\nmodel time series that mimic the main properties of the cardiovascular signals we show\nthat, when the noise is strong and the frequency variability is large, the underlying\ndynamics cannot be determined unambiguously. Nonetheless, time-frequency methods\nhave the potential advantage over DFA and phase-space techniques that they can in\nprinciple separate the different oscillatory components, and can thus provide information\nspecific to particular physiological processes.\nThe time-variable characteristic oscillations can be taken as indicating of a non-\nautonomous system. A time-frequency, or time-phase representation is therefore needed\nfor characterisation of the corresponding dynamics. The wavelet transform, as a time-\nfrequency method, enables the instantaneous frequencies to be traced as they evolve\nin time. Where several oscillatory components are present, however, and because the\ntime of observation in reality is inevitably finite, we face difficulties in estimation of\nthe lower oscillation frequencies. The longer their period in comparison to the total\nobservation time, the more obtrusive the noise becomes. The lower frequencies may\nthus be misestimated as the result of poor statistical averaging. We note that the problem\nof identifying characteristic frequencies in the presence of noise is widespread, because\nbiological systems are characterised by inherently noisy oscillatory dynamics.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been supported by the Slovenian Ministry of Education, Science and\nSport, Joy Welch Trust (UK), the EPSRC (UK) and INTAS.\nREFERENCES\n1.
