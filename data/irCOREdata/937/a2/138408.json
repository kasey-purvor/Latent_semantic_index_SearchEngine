Instead,\nthe requirement is for the creation of an agile organisation embedded within\nan agile supply chain\nINTRODUCTION\nFashion markets have long attracted the interest of researchers. More often\nthe focus of their work was the psychology and sociology of fashion and with\nthe process by which fashions were adopted across populations (see for\nexample Wills and Midgley, 1973). In parallel with this, a body of work has\ndeveloped seeking to identify cycles in fashions (e.g. Carman, 1966). Much\nof this earlier work was intended to create insights and even tools to help\nimprove the demand forecasting of fashion products. However, the reality\nthat is now gradually being accepted both by those who work in the industry\nand those who study it, is that the demand for fashion products cannot be\nforecast. Instead, we need to recognise that fashion markets are complex\nopen systems that frequently demonstrate high levels of \u2018chaos\u2019. In such\nconditions managerial effort may be better expended on devising strategies\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n2\nand structures that enable products to be created, manufactured and\ndelivered on the basis of \u2018real-time\u2019 demand. This is the context that has\nspawned the emerging domain of the agile supply chain (See for example,\nHarrison, Christopher & van Hoek, 1999, Christopher & Towill, 2001) and the\nphilosophy of Quick Response (Lowson, King & Hunter 1999).\n1. THE NATURE OF FASHION MARKETS\nFashion is a broad term which typically encompasses any product or market\nwhere there is an element of style which is likely to be short-lived. We have\ndefined fashion markets as typically exhibiting the following characteristics:\n1. Short life-cycles \u2013 the product is often ephemeral, designed to capture the\nmood of the moment: consequently, the period in which it will be saleable\nis likely to be very short and seasonal, measured in months or even\nweeks.\n2. High volatility \u2013 demand for these products is rarely stable or linear. It\nmay be influenced by the vagaries of weather, films, or even by pop stars\nand footballers.\n3. Low predictability \u2013 because of the volatility of demand it is extremely\ndifficult to forecast with any accuracy even total demand within a period,\nlet alone week-by-week or item-by-item demand.\n4. High impulse purchasing \u2013 many buying decisions by consumers for these\nproducts are made at the point of purchase. In other words, the shopper\nwhen confronted with the product is stimulated to buy it, hence the\ncritical need for \u2018availability\u2019.\nToday\u2019s fashion market place is highly competitive and the constant need to\n\u2018refresh\u2019 product ranges means that there is an inevitable move by many\nretailers to extend the number of \u2018seasons\u2019 i.e. the frequency with which the\nentire merchandise within a store is changed. In extreme cases, typified by\nthe successful fashion retailer Zara, there might be twenty seasons in a year.\nThe implications of this trend for supply chain management are clearly\nprofound.\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n3\nThe combined effect of these pressures clearly provides a challenge to\nlogistics management. Traditional ways of responding to customer demand\nhave been forecast-based, with the resultant risk of over-stocked or under-\nstocked situations.\nMore recently there has emerged another trend that has added further\ncomplexity and difficulty to the management of fashion logistics. The\ngrowing tendency to source product and materials off-shore has led in many\ncases to significantly longer lead-times. While there is usually a substantial\ncost advantage to be gained, particularly in manufacturing, through sourcing\nin low labour cost areas, the effect on lead-times can be severe. It is not\nonly distance that causes replenishment lead-times to lengthen in global\nsourcing. It is the delays and variability caused by internal processes at both\nends of the chain as well as the import\/export procedures in between. The\nend result is longer \u2018pipelines\u2019 with more inventory in them with the\nconsequent risks of obsolescence that arise.\nMuch of the pressure for seeking low cost manufacturing solutions has come\nfrom retailers. At the same time there have been moves by many retailers in\nthe apparel business to reduce significantly the number of suppliers with\nwhom they do business. This supply-base rationalisation has been driven by\na number of considerations, but in particular by the need to develop more\nresponsive replenishment systems - something that is not possible when\nsourcing is spread over hundreds, if not thousands, of suppliers.\n2. MANAGING THE FASHION LOGISTICS PIPELINE\nConventional wisdom holds that the way to cope with uncertainty is to\nimprove the quality of the forecast. Yet, by definition, the volatility of\ndemand and the short life-cycles found in many fashion markets make it\nhighly unlikely that forecasting methods will ever be developed that can\nconsistently and accurately predict sales at the item level. Instead ways\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n4\nmust be found of reducing the reliance that organisations place upon the\nforecast and instead to focus on lead-time reduction. Shorter lead-times\nmean, by definition that the forecasting horizon is shorter - hence the risk of\nerror is lower. In the same way that the Captain of a super-tanker has a\nplanning horizon that is determined by the vessel\u2019s stopping distance (many\nmiles) so too in business the forecast period is determined by the time it\ntakes to design, make and ship the product - lead-times in other words.\nThere are three critical lead-times that must be managed by organisations\nthat seek to compete successfully in fashion markets:\nTime-to-Market - how long does it take the business to recognise a market\nopportunity and to translate this into a product or service and to bring it to\nthe market?\nTime-to-Serve - how long does it take to capture a customer\u2019s order and to\ndeliver the product to the retail customer\u2019s satisfaction?\nTime-to-React - how long does it take to adjust the output of the business\nin response to volatile demand? Can the \u2018tap\u2019 be turned on or off quickly?\n2.1 Time-to- Market\nIn these short life-cycle markets, being able to spot trends quickly and to\ntranslate them into products in the shop in the shortest possible time has\nbecome a pre-requisite for success. Companies that are slow to market can\nsuffer in two ways. Firstly they miss a significant sales opportunity that\nprobably will not be repeated. Secondly the supplier is likely to find that\nwhen the product finally arrives in the market place, demand is starting to\nfall away leading to the likelihood of markdowns. Figure 1 illustrates the\ndouble jeopardy confronting those organisations that are slow to market.\nNew thinking in manufacturing strategy which has focused on flexibility and\nbatch size reduction has clearly helped organisations reduce time-to-market.\nThe use of highly automated processes such as computer aided design (CAD)\nand computer aided manufacturing (CAM) have revolutionised the ability to\nmake product changes as the season or the life cycle progresses.\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n5\nFigure 1 : Shorter Life-cycles making timing crucial\n2.2 Time-to-Serve\nTraditionally in fashion industries orders from retailers have had to be placed\non suppliers many months ahead of the season. Nine months was not\nunusual as a typical lead-time. Clearly, in such an environment the risk of\nboth obsolescence and stock-outs is high as well as the significant inventory\ncarrying cost that inevitably is incurred somewhere in the supply chain as a\nresult of the lengthy pipeline.\nWhy should the order to delivery cycle be so long? It is not the time it takes\nto make or ship the product. More often the problem lies in the multiple\nsteps that occur from the point at which a decision is taken to place an order,\nthrough the generation of the accompanying documentation (particularly in\noverseas transactions involving quota approvals, letters of credit and so\nforth), even before the order enters into the suppliers\u2019 processes - which\nthemselves are likely to be equally lengthy. Often the total time in\nmanufacture is considerable because of the traditional, batch-based\nproduction methods. In other words each step in the total manufacturing\ncycle is managed separately from each other and the quantities processed at\nSales\nTime\n\u2022 Less time to make profit\n\u2022 Higher risk of obsolescence\nMarket\nLate Entrant\nObsolescent\nStock\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n6\neach step are determined by so-called economic batch quantities.\nFurthermore, when manufacture takes place off-shore, considerable time is\nconsumed in preparing documentation, in consolidating full container loads\nand in-bound customs clearance after lengthy, surface transportation.\nThe underpinning philosophy that has led to this way of doing things is cost-\nminimisation. Primarily the costs that are minimised are the costs of\nmanufacture and secondly the costs of shipping. In fact, this view of cost is\ntoo narrow and ultimately self-defeating. The real issue is the total supply\nchain cost, the costs of obsolescence, forced markdowns and inventory\ncarrying costs.\n2.3 Time-to-React\nIdeally, in any market, an organisation would want to be able to meet any\ncustomer requirement for the products on offer at the time and place the\ncustomer needs them.\nClearly, some of the major barriers to this are those highlighted in the\nprevious paragraphs, i.e. time-to-market and time-to-serve. However, a\nfurther problem that organisations face as they seek to become more\nresponsive to demand is that they are typically slow to recognise changes in\nreal demand in the final market place. The challenge to any business in a\nfashion market is to be able to see \u2018real\u2019 demand. Real demand is what\nconsumers are buying or requesting hour-by-hour, day-by-day. Because\nmost supply chains are driven by orders (i.e. batched demand) which\nthemselves are driven by forecasts and inventory replenishment, individual\nparties in the chain will have no real visibility of the final market place. As\nFigure 2 suggests, inventory hides demand. In other words the fact that\nthere will usually be multiple, independent decisions on re-ordering policies\nand inventory levels from the retail shelf back through wholesalers, to\nsuppliers means that up-stream parties in the chain are unable to anticipate\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n7\nthe changing needs of the customers other than through a forecast based as\nmuch upon judgment and guess-work as it is upon actual consumer demand.\nFigure 2 : Inventory hides demand\nThe fundamental problem that faces many companies - not just those in\nfashion industries - is that the time it takes to source materials, convert\nthem into products and move them into the market place is invariably longer\nthan the time the customer is prepared to wait. This difference between\nwhat might be called the \u2018logistics pipeline\u2019 and the customers\u2019 order cycle\ntime is termed the \u2018lead-time gap\u2019. Conventionally, this gap was filled with a\nforecast-based inventory - there was no other way of attempting to ensure\nthat there would be product available as and when customers demanded it.\nThese lengthy supply pipelines often result in revenue losses in the final\nmarket. Table 1 provides an indication of the size of these losses and of note\nis the cost of carrying inventory. The biggest item is forced markdowns -\nmainly at retail - with the total losses amounting to over 14% of retail sales.\nA distinction is made between promotional markdowns, e.g., special sales,\nand the marking-down that occurs out of necessity when a season ends and\nunwanted goods must be moved to make way for new merchandise - forced\nmarkdowns.\nTable 1 \u2013Revenue losses in the apparel pipeline (% retail sales)\nRe-order\nPoint\nRe-order\nPoint\nRe-order\nPoint\nInventory\nLevel\nManufacturer Wholesaler Retailer\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n8\nIt is against this background that the Quick Response (QR) movement\noriginated in 1984 from a textile industry research programme in the US.\nStudies at the time revealed a clothing industry pipeline in which inventories\nand work-in-progress had reached alarming levels and it is a situation that\ncan still be seen in many industries. The nature of Quick Response will be\nexplored later. More information concerning its history can be found in\nHunter, (1990) and Gunston and Harding, (1986).\n3. THE AGILE SUPPLY CHAIN\nIn recent years there has been a growing interest in the design and\nimplementation of agile supply chain strategies (Christopher, 2000).\nThe idea of agility in the context of supply chain management focuses around\n\u2018responsiveness\u2019. Conventional supply chains have been lengthy with long\nlead-times and hence, of necessity, have been forecast-driven. By contrast,\nagile supply chains are shorter and seek to be demand-driven. A further\ndistinction is that because conventional supply chains are forecast-driven\nthat implies that they are inventory-based. Agile supply chains are more\nlikely to be information-based.\nBy their very nature, fashion markets are volatile and difficult to predict.\nHence the need for agility.\nIt has been suggested (Harrison, Christopher & van Hoek, 1999) that an\nagile supply chain has a number of characteristics. Specifically the agile\nsupply chain is:\n\uf0b7 market sensitive \u2013 it is closely connected to end-user trends\n\uf0b7 virtual \u2013 it relies on shared information across all supply chain partners\n\uf0b7 network-based \u2013 it gains flexibility by using the strengths of specialist\nplayers\n\uf0b7 process aligned \u2013 it has a high degree of process interconnectivity\nbetween the network members\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n9\nFigure 3 suggests that there are a number of practical ways in which these\nfour key dimensions can be brought into play to create an agile supply chain\nfor organisations competing in fashion industries.\nFigure 3 : The foundations for agility in a fashion business\nConsidering each of these four dimensions in turn, a number of observations\ncan be made.\n3.1 Market sensitivity\nBeing close to the customer has always been a goal of any market-oriented\nbusiness, but in fashion retailing it is vital. Successful fashion retailers\ncapture trends as they emerge using a variety of means. Point-of-sale data\nis analysed daily and is used to determine replenishment requirements where\nthe intention is to continue to make the product available. Often though the\nAgile\nsupply\nchain\nNetwork\nbased\nVirtual\nMarket\nsensitive\nProcess\nintegration\n\u2022Daily P.O.S. feedback\n\u2022Capture emerging trends\n\u2022Listen to consumers\n\u2022Leverage partners\u2019 capabilities\n\u2022Focus on core competencies\n\u2022Act as network orchestrator\n\u2022Co-managed inventory\n\u2022Collaborative product design\n\u2022Synchronous supply\n\u2022Shared information on real demand\n\u2022Collaborative planning\n\u2022End-to-end visibility\nBased on the model originally developed by Harrison, Christopher & van Hoek (1999)\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n10\nselling season is only intended to be short and product will not be\nreplenished, in such situations the data is used to analyse trends.\nBeyond point-of-sale data are real consumers and identifying their\npreferences and changing requirements should be a continuing priority.\nZara, the Spanish-based fashion retailer, has teams of fashion \u2018scouts\u2019 who\nseek out new ideas and trends across the markets in which they compete.\nThey also use their own salespeople to identify customers\u2019 likes and dislikes\nand to feed this information back to the design team. Using computer aided\ndesign and computer aided manufacturing (CAD\/CAM), these ideas can\nquickly be converted into tangible products and be in the marketplace in a\nmatter of weeks.\n3.2 Virtual integration\nThe agile supply chain is virtual in the sense that it is connected and\nintegrated through shared information on real demand so that all the players\nin the chain, from the fabric manufacturers to the garment makers to the\nretailer, are all working to the same set of numbers.\nRetailers and their suppliers need to be more closely connected through\nshared information than was the case in the past. Until very recently, few\nretailers in any sector would share point-of-sale data with their suppliers.\nNow, however, there is a growing realisation that shared information can\nenable higher levels of on-the-shelf availability to be achieved with less\ninventory. Simultaneously, transaction costs can be reduced particularly if\nthe co-operating parties are prepared to move to co-managed inventory\n(CMI).\nCMI is a process through which the supplier collaborates with the retailer to\nmanage the flow of product into the customer\u2019s distribution system. The\nsupplier and the customer jointly agree the desired stock levels that need to\nbe maintained in the retailer\u2019s operation. The customer feedback sales data\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n11\nis sent on a regular basis to the supplier who then uses that information to\nplan replenishments. Typically such arrangements work best where the\ndemand for the product is relatively stable and replenishments within the\nseason are possible.\n3. 3 Network based\nA distinguishing feature of agile companies is their use of flexible\narrangements with a wide supply base. Zara and Benetton are two fashion\ncompanies that have achieved high levels of customer responsiveness by\nworking closely with specialist, often small, manufacturers. The strategy at\nZara is that only those operations which enhance cost efficiency through\neconomies of scale are conducted in-house (such as dyeing, cutting, labelling\nand packaging). All other manufacturing activities, including the labour-\nintensive finishing stages, are completed by networks of more than 300 small\nsubcontractors, each specialising in one particular part of the production\nprocess or garment type. These subcontractors work exclusively for Zara\u2019s\nparent, Inditex S.A. In return, they receive the necessary technological,\nfinancial and logistical support required to achieve stringent time and quality\ntargets. The system is flexible enough to cope with sudden changes in\ndemand.\nBenetton, likewise, have long used a myriad of small manufacturers to give\nthem additional capacity in activities such as knitting and final assembly.\nThe principle behind an agile network in some ways runs counter to the\nprevailing idea that organisations should work with a smaller number of\nsuppliers, but on a longer term basis. Instead in an agile network there is a\ntendency for the focal firm to act as the \u2018orchestrator\u2019 of the network, the\nmembership of which will change according to requirements. There is a good\nanalogy with the director of a theatre play. For the specific season during\nwhich the play is being performed, the director will work very closely with a\nrelatively small group of actors and actresses. Probably he or she has\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n12\nchosen this team from a much bigger pool of players who he or she has also\nworked with in the past. However, for the next play or season, that team will\nbe disbanded and a new one assembled from the pool. Even though these\nrelationships are not permanent, they are close.\n3.4 Process alignment\nResponsive supply chains require a high level of process alignment both\nwithin the company and externally with upstream and downstream partners.\nBy process alignment is meant the ability to create \u2018seamless\u2019 or\n\u2018boundaryless\u2019 connections, in other words there are no delays caused by\nhand-offs or buffers between the different stages in the chain and\ntransactions are likely to be paperless. The underpinning processes will also\nprobably be managed by \u2018horizontal\u2019 and cross-functional teams.\nIn an agile network, process alignment is critical and is enabled by the new\ngeneration of web-based software that enables different entities to be\nconnected even though their internal systems may be quite different. Now it\nis possible for organisations that are geographically dispersed and\nindependent of each other in terms of ownership to act as if they were one\nbusiness.\nIn the fashion business there can often be many different entities involved in\nthe process that begins with product design and ends with the physical\nmovement of the product onto the retailer\u2019s shelf. Co-ordinating and\nintegrating the flow of information and material is critical if quick response to\nchanging fashion is to be achieved.\nIn conventional fashion supply chains, it can take twelve months from\nproduct design to the final sale. By contrast by creating \u2018virtual teams\u2019\nacross the network where information is shared in real-time, a much higher\ndegree of synchronisation can be achieved (see for example Johnson, 2002).\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n13\nWe now turn to a particular approach that has gained much popularity in\nfashion industries as a method by which to seek agility and speed of\nresponse. It is also a strategy that has begun to challenge the accepted\nwisdom of sourcing goods and other inputs from less well-developed\neconomies.\n4. The Road to Quick Response (QR) in Fashion Industries\nToday, QR is recognised as an operations strategy (Lowson, 2002) and as\nsuch, it attracts considerable interest for two additional, yet closely related\nreasons. First, the ability of this strategy to cope with the complexity of\nfashion logistics; and, second, as a method to combat the relentless shift\ntoward offshore sourcing from low wage economies.\nIn all fast moving industries, demand is now more fragmented and the\nconsumer more discerning about quality and choice. There is also an\nincreasing fashion influence; no single style or fashion has dominated for any\nlength of time. For many consumer sectors, demand is approaching the\nchaotic in its insatiable appetite for diverse services and goods. \u2018Mass-\ncustomisation\u2019 and individualised products with shorter season lengths; micro\nmerchandising and markets segmented at the individual level; large numbers\nof products chasing a diminishing market share; are all evidence of the\ninexorable movement toward a \u2018sea change\u2019 and mark the folly of firms\nexpecting to operate as they have in the past. One of the most fundamental\nQuick Response philosophies is the ability to compress time in the supply\nsystem. If the pipeline is condensed to about one third of its traditional\nlength, not only does the design of goods better reflect more accurate\nconsumer information, it is possible for the retailer to re-assess the demand\nfor products while the season is under way and receive small, frequent\nreorders from the supplier, provided reorder lead times are short enough, (of\nthe order of 2 - 4 weeks), Harding, (1985).\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n14\nQuick Response (QR) can be defined as:\nA state of responsiveness and flexibility in which an organisation seeks to\nprovide a highly diverse range of products and services to a\ncustomer\/consumer in the exact quantity, variety and quality, and at the\nright time, place and price as dictated by real-time customer\/consumer\ndemand. QR provides the ability to make demand-information driven\ndecisions at the last possible moment in time ensuring that diversity of\noffering is maximised and lead-times, expenditure, cost and inventory\nminimised. QR places an emphasis upon flexibility and product velocity in\norder to meet the changing requirements of a highly competitive, volatile and\ndynamic marketplace. QR encompasses an operations strategy, structure,\nculture and set of operational procedures aimed at integrating enterprises in\na mutual network through rapid information transfer and profitable exchange\nof activity, (Lowson, King and Hunter, 1999).\nQR has a number of strategic implications for the organisation. Research has\nshown that mere implementation of technology or particular procedures\nwithout the strategic underpinning leads to sub-optimal performance,\n(Lowson 2002).\n\uf0b7 The alignment of organisational activity to demand. This is a\nfundamental principle of QR. All activities within an enterprise should\nbe paced to demand and customer behaviour. Products and services\nare produced and delivered in the variety and volume that match\ndemand. The activity within a company moves to the beat of this\ndrum.\n\uf0b7 Linkages between demand and supply. Given the importance of the\nalignment activity above, a strategic understanding of the drivers of\ndemand and its synchronised connection with supply is imperative for\nQR.\n\uf0b7 Demand Relationships. QR recognises that both customers\/consumers\nand products are dynamic and place unique demands on the\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n15\norganisation. Identical products will have unique product flows\ndepending upon customer\/consumer buying behaviour and QR needs\nSimilarly, product attributes will vary by product type.\n\uf0b7 Resource Configuration. In the QR world, this strategic architecture is\ninter-organisational. Strategy and strategic thinking are at a network\nlevel, encompassing many external interconnections. In addition,\nwithin this configuration must fit the mapping of customer\/consumer\nvalues and perceived benefits onto operations, in order to underpin the\nlink between demand and activity (as above).\n\uf0b7 Time. Time as a strategic weapon is vital to QR operation, but like any\nweapon its effectiveness depends upon the circumstances of its use.\nAs with demand, time-based competition requires careful assessment\nas to where best it can serve customers\/consumers. Fast and\naccurate adaptation to market change is perhaps the most important\nelement of the QR strategy.\n\uf0b7 Primacy of information. Data and information are the foundation of QR\n\u2013 every business is an information business. Timely and accurate\nflows will enable fast and accurate responses without waste and\nunnecessary cost.\n\uf0b7 Partnerships and Alliances. Perhaps one of the most significant\ndevelopments in recent management and business thinking has been\nexternalisation; the recognition that performance relies increasingly\nupon a series of alliances and relationships with other enterprises in\nthe environment as the most effective way to deal with constantly\nchanging market conditions.\nApart from the strategic implications, Quick Response also requires a number\nof operational building blocks that have to be integrated and aligned for\nefficient and effective reaction to \u2018real\u2019-time demand (see Lowson, King and\nHunter, 1999). Mere possession, however, of the various technologies,\nprocesses and activities will be insufficient for an agile response; close\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n16\nlinkages are required across the whole supply system in order to provide a\nQR capability.\n4.1 Quick Response and Offshore Sourcing\nAs highlighted earlier, consumer demand is becoming more volatile. QR is\ndesigned for such an environment. The fashion industry is, perhaps, one of\nthe most demanding challenges for logistics management with hundreds of\ncolours, thousands of styles and millions of SKU\u2019s on the retail shelves at any\none time. Further, the average shelf lives of these merchandise items\nshortens with each passing year.\nA key factor in the value of QR is its ability to deal with uncertainty or\nvariance. There are numerous sources of uncertainty in a fashion supply\npipeline starting with demand through to the reliability on the part of\nsuppliers and shippers, etc, and Quick Response offers the ability to counter\nthe negative impacts of uncertainty. Speed and flexibility are the key, but it\nis important to realise that the level of uncertainty associated with the\nproduct dictates the optimal level of speed and flexibility required. The type\nof supply chain needs to fit the characteristics of the product as well as the\nuncertainty associated with it.\nMany fashion goods sell in distinct seasons and are on the shelf for just one\nseason and almost totally replaced in the following year. Figure 4 represents\nsales of a typical product subject to pronounced seasonal fluctuation.\nFigure 4 - Seasonality Profile\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n17\nThe normal practice is to manufacture as much as possible of the finished\ngoods inventory required before the season starts and then deliver half to\ntwo-thirds of the necessary products before the beginning of the season\n(point A) and ship the balance of the inventory at pre-agreed times (e.g.,\npoint B), or await re-orders (points B to C). QR takes a different route.\nAlthough it may pose manufacturing capacity problems, as little as possible is\nmade or shipped before the season. From day one, Point-of-Sale (PoS) data\nare gathered, analysed, and then used to understand demand preferences.\nManufacturing is then guided by the continuing (daily or weekly) PoS data.\nRe-order and re-estimation and replenishment approaches are then used for\nfrequent re-orders (points A to B). This QR approach can be better\nappreciated when applied to a particular demand situation such as global or\noffshore sourcing.\n4.1 Quick Response and the Costs of Offshore Sourcing\nQuick Response operations strategy offers a high degree of speed, flexibility\nand responsiveness in supply pipelines. This has substantial implications for\nsourcing decisions; particularly offshore sourcing. Empirical research has\nestablished that sourcing offshore to secure lower cost inputs (typically from\nlow wage, underdeveloped regions) can have negative consequences; once\nthe hidden and inflexibility costs are quantified, Lowson (2001).\nA\nC\nB\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n18\nHidden costs are those that are not typically anticipated by the buying\norganisation, but almost always occur. Some examples include: the various\ninitial investments to establish the new source of supply, control of quality\nand delivery variables; high initial training costs, coupled with a high staff\nturnover affecting both throughput and quality; significantly lower operator\nefficiency offshore; irrevocable letters of credit charges; delays at the port of\nentry, last minute use of air freight and other logistics costs; expensive\nadministrative travel to correct problems; process inefficiencies and quality\nproblems; long lead times and the need for large buffer inventories; and\nfinally, the not insubstantial human cost involved in the conditions endured in\nmany foreign factory environments often employing child labour and over-\nusing natural resources.\nInflexibility costs are the costs of using suppliers that are inflexible and\nunresponsive to changes in demand (before, during and after a product\nselling season), leading to disproportionate levels of demand amplification\nacross a longer supply network and a number of considerable cost\nimplications.\nIt is only when these two cost categories can be properly quantified that the\nadvantages and disadvantages of low wage, foreign purchasing can be fully\nunderstood and a method for their true representation becomes apparent.\nOnce the hidden costs are categorised, sourcing on the basis of low cost\nalone becomes far less attractive. Further, when the costs of inflexibility are\nadded, it becomes clear that using a domestic Quick Response supplier may\nbe a far better option due to the added velocity and flexibility that is\nprovided.\nCollapsing the product pipeline can reduce time and provide a more efficient\nresponse to rapidly changing consumer demand. In this way, a QR\noperations strategy will encourage the cross-enterprise re-engineering of\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n19\nbusiness processes, from product development to replenishment, with\nresulting improved stocking points, lower inventory, lower cost and increased\nsales. The value chain is reconfigured to reflect speed of response, flexibility\nand differentiation. Table 2 compares two different sourcing alternatives: the\nQuick Response domestic supplier and the offshore counterpart.\nTable 2 - QR and Faster Turnover\nIn this initial scenario two possible buying decisions are reviewed using QR\nand then offshore sources of supply. First, end-consumer purchases,\nwhether bought from a retailer or manufacturer, are assumed to be one-\nhundred thousand pounds. It is then assumed that the customer (a\nmanufacturer or retailer) has bought the goods for the same price (\u00a360k).\nAn averaged gross margin is also assumed of 40% on these sales. The only\ndifference between the two sourcing alternatives is the flexibility and speed\nof response. The ability of the QR supplier to rapidly replenish the stock of\nthe customer (manufacturer or retailer) to real-time consumer demand\nallows the customer to turn inventory of the product 6 as opposed to 2.5\ntimes a year. This faster turnover rapidly increases the customer\u2019s gross\nmargin return1 on each pound invested in inventory from \u00a31.67 to \u00a34.00,\nmore than twice that of the offshore competition. Because of this inventory\nturnover advantage the manufacturer or retailer could afford to pay a\npremium for the product and still get a better return (Table 3).\nTable 3 - QR and a Higher Cost of Goods\nIn the table the price paid for goods by the customer has increased by\nalmost one-third, but because of the flexibility and responsiveness of the\nsupplier, the return on inventory has increased by 1.2 percent or from 167%\nto 169%.\n1 GMROI is calculated as gross margin\/average inventory\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n20\nTable 4 views the sourcing decision from another perspective. The decision\nto move sourcing offshore to a competitor with lower unit cost but a slower\nresponse.\nTable 4 - A Move to Offshore Supply\nIn this situation the foreign supplier would need to reduce the purchase price\nby nearly 35% to retain a comparative GMROI to that of the QR supplier.\nThe more flexible and higher velocity supplier proves more competitive than\nthe lower-cost; even without taking into account the other hidden and\ninflexibility costs.\nProduct velocity also produces other benefits. Replenishing stock in response\nto real-time demand ensures that the right goods are available reflecting\nwhat is being demanded. Revenue will rise as products in demand are sold\nat the expected price rather than marked down as unwanted. Table 5 shows\nthe shows the combined effect of velocity, faster inventory turns and reduced\nmarkdowns.\nTable 5 - The Effect of QR Velocity\nAs product velocity increases so too will revenue as there is less need to sell\ngoods below optimum price points. The customer\u2019s (manufacturer or\nretailer) return on investment grows to over 3-times that of a competitor.\nFinally, Quick Response also has an impact upon strategic pricing decisions.\nVelocity and flexibility in the supply system will allow an original equipment\nmanufacturer (OEM) or retailer to reduce the price of the finished good below\nthat of the competition and capture greater market share (Table 6).\nTable 6 - QR and Strategic Pricing\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n21\nBecause of QR flexibility and responsiveness, the retailer or manufacturer\ncan reduce the purchase price to the consumer by 32% and still earn a\nslightly better return in terms of GMROI than competitors.\n5. CONCLUSION\nThis paper has provided a conceptual focus upon the main logistical issues\ninvolved in fashion retailing. The peculiar nature of the industry was\ndiscussed in terms of its volatility, complexity and dynamism. It is with\nthese factors in mind, that the need for agility and responsiveness in the\nlogistics pipeline has been identified.\nFashion supply systems are characterised by three critical lead-times: time-\nto-market, time-to-serve and time-to-react. All three of these factors stress\nthe importance of agility in fashion supply networks. Agility does, however,\nnecessitate radical changes in organisational structures and strategies and a\nmove away from forecast-driven supply. Market sensitivity, virtual\nintegration, networked logistical systems and process alignment all become\nfundamental prerequisites to achieving the ultimate agility, a Quick Response\ncapability.\nQuick Response (QR) offers a new dimension in fashion retailing. For both\nretailers and manufacturing suppliers it provides a new operational approach,\none that is alien to many firms still operating with structures designed for a\nmass production era. The paper provided a review of QR, the agility it\nprovides, its strategic implications and the building blocks necessary for its\nimplementation. The final section of this work demonstrated how a Quick\nResponse operations strategy provides a more viable and attractive sourcing\noption compared to the use of low cost inputs from under-developed\neconomies. Once the various costs (hidden and inflexibility) are properly\nunderstood and computed, the impact of agility, flexibility and\nresponsiveness in fashion supply systems becomes paramount.\nInternational Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, Vol. 32, 2004\n22\nReferences\nCarman, J., (1966), \u201cThe Fate of Fashion Cycles in our Modern Society\u201d,\nScience, Technology and Society, American Marketing Association, Chicago,\nUSA.\nChristopher, M., (2000), \u201cThe Agile Supply Chain : Competing in Volatile\nMarkets\u201d, Industrial Marketing Management, Vol 29, pp 37-44.\nChristopher, M. and Towill, D., (2001), \u201cAn Integrated Model for the Design\nof Agile Supply Chains\u201d, International Journal of Physical Distribution &\nLogistics Management, Vol. 13, No. 4, pp 235-246\nGunston R and Harding P (1986), \u201cQuick Response: US and UK Experiences\u201d,\nTextile Outlook International, 10, pp 43-51.\nHunter NA (1990), Quick Response for Apparel Manufacturing, Textile\nInstitute, UK.\nHarrison, A., Christopher, M. and van Hoek, R.
