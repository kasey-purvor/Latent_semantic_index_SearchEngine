ISBN: 1-85377-256-9.\nSoftback, 242 pages, \u00a315.00.\nThis book is written from the viewpoint that\nlearning technology, although perceived of\nimmense value, is not being exploited to its full\npotential, nor are its effects on student learning\nfully understood. Obtaining as accurate a\npicture as possible in order to correctly to\ninfluence policy and practice is an activity that is\nrightly receiving increased attention. No one\ncould expect a 'how to do it' book for this\nsubject area.as outcomes (be they of learning,\ncost-effectiveness or of more abstract influence)\nare dictated by a wide range of factors. Martin\nOliver (from the LaTTD group at the University\nof North London) has gathered a wide range of\ninteresting papers (derived from the Evaluation\nof Learning Technologies conference, 1998) to\ndemonstrate the diversity of approaches in this\nfield. The book comprises some 242 pages that\nare arranged into 14 chapters, written by those\ninvolved in related projects.\nThe opening chapter provides an excellent\noverview of the subject, highlighting the\ndifference between the intentions of educators\nand real-world usage. Various methods of\nevaluating educational effectiveness are briefly\ndescribed and comparisons of their applicability\nare made. The descriptions of the methods are\nbrief but the highlight here is on their purpose. It\nis made quite clear that the methods described\nwill not provide the answers simply by their\napplication. Several projects of note are\ndescribed in more detail with an emphasis on\ntheir comparative merits, which I found to be the\ngreatest feature of the book. The section\ndescribing the evaluation of economic effective-\nness addresses this particularly awkward aspect\nby listing the various incentives behind the\nendeavour and the success of measures to date.\nThere are of course, more questions than\nanswers, but some guidelines for refining\nprocedures are offered.\nThe majority of the contributions describe the\nevaluation of Web-based resources and the\nauthors are refreshingly frank in the admission\nthat 'no single approach exists that suits all\nneeds and avoids any difficulties' and that\n'educational value is difficult to specify let alone\ncreate a metric for'. Many of the projects\ndescribed consider the common problems of\nusing quantitative and qualitative methods, for\nexample, the ethical and logistical considerations\nof qualitative methods, the usefulness and time-\nconsuming nature of quantitative methods.\nChapter 2 is a review of the CIAO! framework\ndeveloped by the Computer and Learning\nresearch group at the Open University. It centres\non three aspects of educational impact: context\n(the aims as described in policy documents by\nthe CAL designers), interactions (records of\nactivity through online logs, diaries, observation\nand computer recording) and attitudes (affective\noutcomes through interviews and measures of\nlearning). It is argued that attitudinal data may\n101\nReviews\nnot reflect the educational benefit and this may\nbe related to expectations. However, tracking\noutcomes is limiting because 'it only tells you\nwhat has happened, not how and why'. The\nchapter includes a particularly useful section on\nthe possible disadvantages of the framework.\nChapters 3 to 5 discuss the tracking of\ninteractivity, the evaluation of collaborative\ntutorial teaching and evaluation using ethno-\ngraphy. The common problems of using quanti-\ntative and qualitative methods are touched upon\nin the majority of chapters, i.e. the ethical and\nlogistical considerations of qualitative methods,\nand the usefulness and time-consuming nature\nof quantitative methods. Chapter 6 describes the\nuse of Time-Lapse Rep Grids, a method that can\nbe used for the charting of personal change after\nexperiencing educational technology. The\nRepertory grid technique enables the mapping of\nan individual's internal views and theories and\ncan be used to monitor changes in perceptions:\n\"The validity of the instrument is checked by\nexamining the meanings with the participants.'\nThe grids can be used to generate both\nquantitative and qualitative data, as graphing\nthe data is possible.\nOther approaches described in the book include:\n'Insights through Triangulation' (which helped\nto assess the direction that the contributor's\nUniversity should take in the future);\n'Evaluation of confidence assessment' (there was\nsome self-assessment in that process, and\nrefinement of knowledge structures); and a\n'Toolkit for Tracking Interactivity and\nLearning'. This evaluation of the user's\ninteractivity with a CD-ROM-based tutorial\ncalled 'Galapagos' adopted a novel approach for\nmonitoring students' behaviour while at a\ncomputer. The observations were made by\nrecording the output from the computer screen\nto video and simultaneously recording the\nstudent's activity around the computer,\nwhereupon the two sources were mixed together\nonto one tape.\nThe three chapters reviewing the evaluation of\neconomic effectiveness varied considerably in the\ndepth of their respective approaches. Together,\nthey serve to highlight what we might consider\nto be realistic achievements in our own studies. I\nfound that some of the chapters were lacking a\nreflection of the value of their findings whereas\nothers critiqued their work and made\nrecommendations for future practice. On the\nwhole, the breadth of purpose and variety of\n102\napproaches described in this book make valuable\nreading. The inclusion of further examples to\nillustrate the paper-based tools described would\nhave been a valuable addition to a highly\nrelevant collection of papers.\nRamsey Baker, University of Bradford\nC. Steed, Web-Based Training, London: Gower,\n1999. ISBN: 0-566-08103-2. Hardback, xv265\npages, \u00a345.00.\nIncreasingly, the Internet and other related\ntechnologies such as intranets and extranets are\nbeing used as support aids to facilitate the\ndelivery of teaching and learning materials. This\nbook describes the principles and techniques\nthat are involved and also explains why Web-\nbased training (WBT) and Internet-based\ntraining (IBT) have become so important in both\nacademic and non-academic organizations. The\nmaterial contained in the book is organized into\neight basic chapters. Each one of these covers a\nmajor theme area such as providing background\nmaterial, theoretical issues, examples of current\npractice, evaluation and future directions of\ndevelopment.\nIn his opening chapter (entitled \"Why Web-\nBased Training?') the author describes the\nnature of the Internet and why he thinks it\nshould be used for the delivery of instructional\nresources. Various examples of successful Web-\nbased training are presented. The chapter\nconcludes with a discussion of the benefits and\ndrawbacks of this approach as seen by users,\nmanagers and providers. In his second chapter\nthe author explores the learning issues and\nimplications of WBT. Following a discussion of\nits benefits and value, the chapter moves on to\nreview some of the important instructional\nprinciples that should be used when dealing with\nadult learners. It then proceeds to a section that\nanalyses and describes the instructional design\nmethodologies employed by two commercial\nWBT course providers - CBT Systems\n(http:\/\/www.cbtsys.com) and NETg\n(http:\/\/www.netg.co.uk). Within this section a\nnumber of well-known instructional theories\nand methodologies are touched upon - for\nexample, Bloom's taxonomy, Mager's\ninstructional objectives and Keller's ARCS\nmodel.\nHaving established a basis and rationale for\nWeb-based training, the author now uses\nChapters 3 to 6 in order to provide numerous\nexamples of sites and organizations that are\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 3\ninvolved in using this training technique.\nChapter 3, for example looks at 'WBT in\nPractice'. Essentially, this chapter describes the\nbasic elements of typical WBT programmes and\nthen gives various illustrations of some of the\nonline courses that are currently available. These\nfall into three basic categories: those that employ\nbasic text and graphics; interactive courses; and\nexamples of interactive multimedia. The URLs\nfor the systems described in this, and\nsubsequent, chapters are provided so that\nreaders can explore each of the systems for\nthemselves. Another important aspect of WBT\nand IBT is the availability of integrated\ncurriculum management systems. Examples of\nthese are described in Chapter 4. Some of the\nsystems discussed in this chapter include:\nLearningSpace (based on Lotus Notes),\nTopClass, CBTCampus, LOIS and Librarian.\nNearly all of the systems that are described\noriginate from the USA - where WBT and IBT\nare probably more well-established and their use\nis more widespread than it is in other countries.\nWithin Chapter 5, which is by far the largest, the\nauthor describes the basic character and\nfacilities available from over twenty 'online\ncurriculum delivery sites'. Amongst those\nincluded are MOLI (Microsoft Online Learning\nInstitute), BT Campus World and various\n'online university' systems, such as IMG\nUniversity Online, CyberState University,\nZDNet University and Street Technologies'\nLearning University. Most of the sites that are\ndescribed deal with IT-related skills and many of\nthe courses are designed to facilitate Microsoft\nor Novell certification. However, some other\ntypes of course are also available - for example,\nlanguage learning and business skills (such as\nBusiness Writing, Human Resource Manage-\nment and Hotel and Food Services Manage-\nment). The cost per course varies considerably -\nfrom free up to 3,500 US dollars or more. Some\nof the courses cater for as many as 40,000 online\nstudents per year. In contrast to the previous\nthree chapters, which concentrate primarily on\norganizations that are based in the USA,\nChapter 6 ('WBT in Use') looks at some\nexamples of the ways in which UK organizations\n(in both the private and public sectors) are using\nWBT. Containing just five brief case studies, this\nis one of the shortest chapters in the book - and\nmaybe reflects the relative level of interest in\nWBT in the UK?\nLike the first two chapters in the book, the last\ntwo deal with principles and concepts rather\nthan WBT sites. Chapter 7 ('Evaluating and\nJustifying WBT for Your Organisation') is a\nuseful one in that it outlines the steps involved in\nrunning projects to assess the need for and\nfeasibility of introducing Web-based training\nwithin an organization. Interestingly, this\nchapter starts off with a discussion of why\npeople like classroom-based training and\ninstructor-led courses. Indeed, despite the\ngrowing popularity of WBT, the author suggests\nthat classroom tuition is likely to grow in\nimportance 'by changing and adapting to the\nnew needs of learners'. In the final chapter\n(entitled 'Training and Learning: The Way\nAhead') the author outlines some of the future\npossibilities for WBT. Following a discussion of\nits growth potential, the chapter next discusses\nsome of the current barriers to creating\nwidespread online learning (such as standards,\nmetaphors and pricing models) and how these\nare likely to be overcome by future developments\nin technology and new business strategies. It\nthen discusses some of the important WBT\nissues that need to be faced in deploying\ndistributed learning solutions over the Internet.\nThe final part of the chapter describes the 'top\nten' trends in training within the USA (these\ninclude the use of performance support and the\ndevelopment of learning organizations). The\nbook ends on a very ambitious note: \"The\nopportunity is for corporate, government and\neducational organizations to provide quality\ninteractive learning to anyone, anywhere and at\nany time, which results in a better educated and\nmore productive organisation and society.'\nIn conclusion, I think this book is well worth 'a\nread'. It brings together a useful collection of\nfacts, figures, techniques, anecdotes and Web\naddresses that reflect current practice and\nongoing activity in this area. In keeping with its\n'Web-minded philosophy', there are only one or\ntwo references to conventional paper-based\nsources - all the other citations are to material\nthat is available through the Internet.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nBonnie A. Nardi and Vicki O'Day, Information\nTechnologies: Using Technology with Heart,\nCambridge, MA: MIT Press, Cambridge, MA,\n1999. ISBN: 0-262-14066-7. Hardback, xiv232\npages, \u00a319.50.\nI enjoyed reading this book which is a\ncomplement to the authors in itself. It is written\nso that it will appeal to a variety of audiences\n103\nReviews\nand has a message that is of direct relevance to\nall those using learning technology. If there was\na particular audience most likely to benefit from\nreading this book it would be managers. The\nauthors might consider that judgement unfair as\na central thesis of the book is that all\nparticipants in an 'information ecology' should\nbe actively engaged in the choices that can shape\nthe local environment. Their aim is to engender a\npublic conversation that leads to an active and\ncritical stance towards technology rather than an\nattitude of either uncritical acceptance or\nblanket condemnation. It is in this sense a very\nAmerican call for an active citizenry, for local\ncollective self-help in the tradition of barn\nraising. It is a political text informed by a set of\nself-imposed constraints on the range of an\nindividual's potential impact. National politics\nand even local politics are not the aim of the\nauthors, rather they are interested in the politics\nof local decisions made in 'your children's\nclassrooms, at your workplace, in your doctors'\noffice, or at your public library' (p. 55).\nThe book uses the authors' considerable\nexperience in Silicon Valley, researching for\nApple, Hewlett-Packard and Xerox, to develop a\ncritical evaluation of new technologies. Using\nethnographic studies, which include studies in\nschools, libraries, offices and a hospital, the\nbook draws on insights derived from empirical\nwork to discuss some broad theoretical issues.\nChapter 3 deals with metaphors that are\npervasive in educational circles, the ideas of the\ncomputer as a tool, as a text and as a system.\nThis concern with metaphors is directly related\nto their concern with action: 'Metaphors matter\nbecause they suggest particular avenues for\naction and intervention' (p. 43).\nAs resources for action, metaphors have a\ncentral place in the book and I found the\ndiscussion useful if a little underdeveloped. For\nexample, this book may surprise those of us who\nhave associated Bonnie Nardi with her advocacy\nof Activity Theory which makes considerable\nuse of the idea of technology as a tool. There\nwas no discussion of this usage and the authors\nconclude that the tool metaphor, though useful\nin a narrow way, distracts from the central\nquestion of the context of use.\nThe metaphor the authors advocate is that of an\n'information ecology' (Chapter 4). Just as they\nidentified the previously discussed metaphors\nwith their weaknesses as resources for action so\nthey promote the ecology metaphor as fostering\n104\nconversations for action. In particular they claim\nthe metaphor emphasizes system, diversity, co-\nevolution, keystone species and a sense of\nlocality. Each term is explained in tum but the\none that struck me as the most original and\nproductive was that of a keystone species. The\nidea of the keystone species is used to spotlight\npeople whose presence is essential to support the\neffective use of a technology. The idea of a\nkeystone species helps to identify the often\nunseen work of people without whom technical\nsystems do not work. In Chapter 7 an extended\nexample is given of the role of the librarian as a\nkeystone species. This chapter alone would\nwarrant reading the book, as it stands as a\nwarning against those who see the Web as a vast\ninformation resource into which we can simply\nplug learners. The remainder of the first part of\nthe book deals briefly with the application of\nhuman values to shaping information ecologies\nand providing practical guidance on how to\n'evolve' an information ecology; The practical\nguidance in Chapter 6 is quite limited, focusing\non human non-technical factors such as core\nvalues, 'paying attention' and asking strategic\nquestions.\nThe second part of the book provides brief and\ninformative vignettes. Each chapter provides a\nshort review of detailed empirical work, each\none based on an ethnography in a different\nsetting. Some of the studies are directly relevant\nto educational technologists; all contain ideas\nand information that will be of value. The study\nof librarian's work in Chapter 7 emphasizes the\nsituational accomplishment of understanding a\nclient's information needs. The authors' cast\nsome much needed light on the skilful\nprocedures that can be so easily glossed over as\nan information search. Their conclusion that the\n'presence of human guides and experts in the\nlibrary is crucial' (p. 104) is a valuable lesson for\nall those interested in using the Web as an\neducational resource.\nChapter 8 reports directly on an educational\napplication of technology with sixth-grade\nstudents. The focus on sustainability and\neducational quality make this chapter useful\nbeyond the particular focus of the research.\nChapter 9 focuses on the largely invisible work of\n'gardeners'. These are people often informally\nrecognized rather than holding a formal position\nin the organization: 'They are the people who\nlike to tinker with computers. They learn the\nsoftware a little better than everyone else around\nthe office, they're often good at configuring\nALT-J Volume 7 Number 3\nhardware, and they troubleshoot and solve\nproblems when others are stumped' (p. 140).\nThere was instant recognition in this snapshot of\na variety of individuals I have known, not\ntechnical experts but often the translators who\ncan bridge an often uncomfortable gap between\ntechnical expertise and practical use.\nIn Chapter 10 a digital photography class is\nreported which builds upon the gardener insight\nwithin an educational setting. The authors\nconclude this chapter with a valuable insight, that\nin an educational environment it is the teachers\nwho are the natural bridge between students and\nthe technology. In this sense educators need to be\ngardeners, a slightly different image from the\ncommon metaphors of moderator or facilitator.\nThe final study in Chapter 11 is one of a failure, a\n'dysfunctional' ecology in a teaching hospital. By\nhighlighting the need to understand how\ntechnical change can disrupt unseen but\nimportant working practices this chapter should\nserve as a timely warning. The questions of\nprivacy and surveillance identified in the chapter\nare issues that are relevant to how students and\ntutors work within an educational environment.\nThis book is a valuable addition to the public\nconversation within the field of learning\ntechnology. It has a broad sweep and a light\ntouch. Without skilful authors it could have\nprovided a candy-floss gloss on difficult issues.\nInstead the use of well-chosen examples and the\nfocus on ubiquitous metaphors provides\nsufficient bite to make the read well worth while.\nChris R. Jones, Lancaster University\nLorraine Marshall and Frances Rowland, A Guide\nto Learning Independently, Melbourne: Addison-\nWesley\/Longman, Third Edition, 1998, ISBN:\n0-582-81170-8. Softback, vii293 pages, $19.95\nAustralian dollars.\nAs its title states, this book is very much a guide\nfor enabling individuals to develop their own\nstrategies for learning and study. Like previous\neditions, this one stems from the basic premise\nthat learning is an individual responsibility, and\nthat given help, ideas and resources, students can\ntake charge of their own learning. However, this\nnew edition has been updated to account for\ncertain developments in higher education which\nwill continue to affect learners: technology,\nresearch into student learning, reflection and\ncritical thinking, diversity and mobility of\nstudent populations.\nStudents should find plenty of information,\nsuggestions and techniques for improving their\nrepertoire of learning skills presented in a style\nthat is interesting, pragmatic and accessible. The\nfriendly style is achieved primarily by addressing\nthe reader as 'you', a technique that allows the\nauthors to establish a dialogue with the\nindividual. This focus on 'you' is further\nreinforced throughout by interspersing the text\nwith frequent prompts to encourage questioning\nand reflective thinking about 'your' own purpose\nfor learning and how 'you' learn best.\nThe book is divided into three sections. Chapters\n1-5 provide the grounding for independent\nlearning by guiding students to understand\nthemselves better through questioning their\nindividual lifestyle, values, ambitions and\nlearning approaches. The next five chapters build\non this approach to self-knowledge while\npresenting ideas for finding, absorbing and\nevaluating information. The remaining six\nchapters deal with the communication, use,\ncritique and presentation of what has been\nlearned.\nChapters 1 and 2 establish the principle of\nreflective enquiry by asking for a self-\nexamination of personal traits, cultural and\nsocial background, surroundings and study\nhabits to help students understand how best to\ncontrol and plan their own study. This is\nfollowed in Chapter 3 by an introduction into\nthe culture of tertiary education, covering topics\nwe often forget to tell new students: what\nuniversities and colleges do, how they are\norganized and how they are changing, how\nlearning relates to the discipline, what is critical\nthinking, what choices students have and how\nthey can make informed decisions, what\ndifficulties they are likely to confront and how\ncan they best deal with them. This is a very good\ndiscussion, dealing with such topical issues as\ncombining study with work and dealing with\nloneliness as a distance learner. The next chapter\nthen encourages students to ask their own\nquestions in the context of their learning -\nguided by the fundamental When? Where? How?\nWho? Why? and What? Chapter 5 closes this\nsection by exploring the relationship between\nlearning and remembering.\n'Choosing and analysing a topic' is a chapter (6)\nthat tackles topics that students often\nmisunderstand: the purposes and expectations of\nassignments, meanings of directive words such\nas criticize or evaluate, and developing and\n\u2014\nReviews\nanalysing a set question. The authors suggest a\nprocedure which should help students to\nunderstand and answer set assignments,\nformatted as a series of self-questions (e.g.\n'What is the question about? What do I already\nknow about the question?'), each of which is\nfollowed by key tasks.\nChapter 7 is a straightforward introduction to\nresearching a topic, but I particularly liked the\nemphasis on selecting and evaluating reference\nmaterial, again reinforcing the message that\nstudents need to develop skills of critical enquiry.\nA practical summary of information sources is\npresented next, including electronic access to\nlibraries, the Internet and mass media, but there is\na cautionary word about the appropriate use of\nsources. The next chapter (on reading) contains\nsuggestions likely to appear in other books of this\nnature. However, there are three gems which\nappear as tables and which I think would be\nincredibly useful to students: the anatomy of a\nbook CTable 9.1), asking questions as you read\n(Table 9.2) and writing a review (Table 9.4).\nChapters 10 and 11 are fairly standard treatments\nof listening in lectures and participating in\ndiscussion groups, although there is new emphasis\non interchanges between different worldviews.\nThe next four chapters deal with writing,\nbeginning with suggestions for writing as a\nregular, often reflective activity. The authors'\nadvice to developing writing skills uses elements\nof both the 'process' and the 'genre' approaches\nto writing. Students are also encouraged to share\ntheir writing with peers, a rare occurrence in my\nexperience. The next two chapters offer\nstructured approaches to writing essays and\nscientific reports, with particular emphasis on\nthe use of questions as a guide for writing. I\nespecially liked the detailed advice on creating\nlogical, accurate and unambiguous scientific\nprose without stifling it with unnecessary passive\nconstructions. Like the rest of the book the\nquotations that punctuated these chapters are\nentertaining and relevant, such as this one on\npreparation and planning from Abraham\nLincoln, 'If I had eight hours to chop down a\ntree, I'd spend six sharpening the axe'. Chapter\n15 completes this section on writing by\nexplaining the use of conventions, a practical\nguide to using quotations and referencing, with\nnumerous different examples, including a note\nabout those used in the book itself.\nThe last chapter discusses learning from\nevaluation, assessment and feedback, drawing\n106\nstudents' attention to the importance of\nunderstanding criteria and standards. This\nchapter closes the loop begun in the first\nchapters by asking students to question what\nthey have learned, and what, how and why they\nwant to learn in the future. The book ends with a\nshort appendix entitled 'Discrimination - Sexist\nLanguage and Attitudes', a curious way of\ncovering this information and which comes\nacross almost as an apology or an afterthought.\nThere are number of 'study skills' books on the\nmarket, and this one certainly sits alongside the\nbest of them. Unlike some others, it does not\ncontain many integrated interactive activities but\nrather provides numerous examples of\napproaches to processes and questions to ask\nyourself as guides to thinking. It gives guides to\nimprove learning processes but relies on the\nreader to apply them. The layout is clean and\nuncluttered. Readers are engaged, not only by\nthe use of the familiar pronoun and extensive\nuse of questions, but also by inclusion of\nsummary boxes, end-of-chapter suggestions for\nusing information, insertion of many relevant\nquotations from a wide range of historical and\ncontemporary sources, and a diverse collection\nof further readings. I would highly recommend it\nto students and teachers.\nKate Morss, Queen Margaret University College,\nEdinburgh\nOtto Peters, Learning and Teaching in Distance\nEducation: Analyses and Perspectives from an\nInternational Perspective, London: Kogan Page,\n1998, ISBN: 0-7494-2855-4.

However,\nhe goes beyond mere description through\ndiscussion of the sociological, cultural,\npsychological and pedagogical conditions in\nwhich distance learning takes place. Peters\nexplores the models adopted by a number of\ninternational institutions, examining current\npractice and the way it can influence future\ndevelopments in distance learning. He goes on to\nconsider the possible impact of digital\ntechnology on practice and theory.\nThe book is divided into eight chapters, each\nwith a useful overview and conclusion. It\nincludes an interesting appendix that charts, by\nreference to four examples, the way distance\nlearning has made use of different technologies\nas they developed from hand-written teaching\nletters to communication via the Internet. There\nis also an extensive list of references and the\nindex is usefully divided into two sections that\nare organized by subject and by name,\nrespectively.\nThe first chapter identifies five factors that\ndifferentiate distance learning from other forms\nof university teaching. Peters takes the view that\nit is a mistake to take as the starting point the\nspatial separation between teacher and student,\nrather that there are fundamental teaching\nproblems inherent to distance education through\na number of special factors. These factors\ninclude the use of .conventional forms of\nlearning and teaching, the use of technical\nmedia, the particular type of student engaged in\ndistance learning and operating modes within\nuniversities.\nChapters 2 and 3 identify and examine the\nteaching and learning models used in distance\neducation. The correspondence model is\ndescribed as an attempt to reduce the distance\nbetween teacher and student by means of\nwritten communication. In the conversation\nmodel the concept is one of a simulated dialogue\nbetween teacher and student. The teacher model\nwas developed to compensate for the physical\nabsence of the teacher by transferring the\n'teacher's voice' to the teaching text, and the\ntutor model, where the text simulates a tutorial.\nFinally, Peters describes the 'technological\nextension' model whereby students attend\nuniversity-based classes with the help of\ntechnical and communication media. He then\ngoes on to introduce the concept of Transac-\ntional Distance, credited to Michael Moore of\nPenn State University, which is then developed\nin the following chapter. The third chapter\ndiscusses the concepts of dialogue, structure and\nautonomy characteristic of Transactional\nDistance in relation to the pedagogic, philos-\nophical and sociological aspects of distance\neducation.\nChapter 4 moves from theory to practice by\nexamining how dialogues, structure and\nautonomy are applied through a number of\ninternational examples. Peters concludes that\nmore opportunities for well-developed student-\ncentred distance education programmes are\nlikely to arise from achieving a balance between\nstructure and dialogue, thereby creating\nopportunities for autonomous learning.\nIn Chapter 5 Peters examines the concepts of\nopen, lifelong, post-industrial and post-modern\nlearning. He argues that, although these\nconcepts stem from different theoretical and\npractical fields, they could complement and sup-\nport each other, permeate one another and have\nan influential effect on the development of\ndistance education.\nChapter 6 is, for me, the most informative and\ninteresting of the book. Here the theory and\npractice come together in the most coherent\nmanner. It begins with a description of the\ndifferent forms that digital learning currently\ntakes - from hypertext to programmed learning\nto video conferencing. Peters then goes on to\nexamine the ways in which current and emerging\ntechnologies can provide new opportunities for\nteaching and learning and how it is changing the\npedagogical concept of distance education. He\ndemonstrates the opportunities that digital\ntechnology offers to change the nature of the\nlearning environment so that students are no\nlonger absorbing, processing and reproducing\ninformation offered to them. Instead they\nbecome researchers and designers, searching for\nknowledge, evaluating and constructing it -\nautonomous or self-directed learners. Peters\nanalyses the way in which digital technology can\nbe utilized to provide a learning environment\nthat is student-centred, provides opportunities\nfor self-directed and collaborative learning and\nincludes appropriate support and scaffolding.\nThe final two chapters examine the teaching and\nlearning models of specific institutions and the\ncharacteristics of each. The institutions covered\ninclude: the University of South Africa; the\n107\nReviews\nOpen University in the UK; the Fern Universitat\nin Germany; the Central Radio and Television\nUniversity in China; the University of the Air in\nJapan; the Empire State College in the USA; the\nAmerican Universities Teleconference Network;\nand finally, an example of institutional\ncollaboration in the Canadian project 'Contact\nNorth'.\nPeters concludes that distance education has the\npotential to meet the changing demands of\nstudents and institutions to extend and diversify\nthe student body and to change the traditional\nviews of teaching and learning. The book\nprovides a thorough analysis and examination of\nthe theoretical and practical aspects of distance\neducation. I feel that the chapter on\ndevelopments in digital technology and its\npotential for distance learning could have been\nexplored further and the inclusion of some\nexamples of good practice would have been\nuseful.\nOverall, I think this book would be a useful\naddition to the library of any academic with an\ninterest in teaching and learning issues in\ngeneral, and in particular to those who are\ninvolved in the development of distance learning\ncourses.\nElaine Pearson, University of Teesside\n108\n"}
