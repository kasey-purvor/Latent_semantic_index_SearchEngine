This paper focuses in particular on what role financial journalists play in the system \nof corporate governance, the ways in which law and regulation recognize that role, and the \nextent to which this role is accepted and understood by financial journalists themselves. The first \npart of the essay reviews recent debate on financial journalism and investigates the role of \nfinancial journalism from a systemic perspective: looking at its role in corporate governance, \nand its impact on market behaviour. I develop the notion that financial and business journalists \noperate within a framework of rights and duties which institutionalize a particular ethical \napproach to their role. The second half of the article, which draws more extensively on \ninterviews conducted with journalists and editors, asks how journalists themselves understand \nand describe their role and what they see as the key challenges they face as they attempt to \nperform it. It emerges that there is no consensus among financial and business journalists \n1about their \u2018watchdog\u2019 role in relation to markets and corporate behaviour, and whilst the \nfinancial journalists interviewed tended to agree on the key challenges they face, they are \nuncertain how to respond to them.  \n \n \n \nKEYWORDS   business; conflict of interest; ethics; financial; journalism; \nregulation. \n \n 2 \nFinancial Journalism: the debate \n \nCriticism of financial and business journalists is not new. They have faced their share of public \ncriticism both before and since the 2007 credit crisis. The charge sheet is a long one: financial \njournalists are criticised for superficiality and for a failure to conduct investigations (Davis 2005, \nWilby 2007, Doyle 2006), for inappropriate news values Doyle 2006). They are criticised for \nbeing insufficiently sceptical (Doyle 2006), and captured (Starkman 2009). The following \npassage, from Columbia Journalism Review (Brady 2003), focuses on the role of CNBC during \nthe first dotcom boom and bust in the US: \n\u2018Critics claim that CNBC\u2019s on-screen personalities led the charge into the speculative \nstocks of the 1990s, stocks that eventually imploded. There are professional questions, as \nwell, about the network\u2019s cheerleading coverage of Wall Streeters who were extolling \nstocks that those same analysts were privately calling \u201ccrap.\u201d The Merrill Lynch analyst \nHenry Blodget, for one example, had been a frequent guest on CNBC. His Internet stocks \nall came crashing down, and eventually it was learned that he\u2019d been recommending \nstocks on-air that he privately called \u201cjunk.\u201d \u2026 Alan Abelson, the respected financial \ncolumnist of Barron\u2019s, comes down hard on the channel. \u201cCNBC,\u201d he says bluntly, \u201cwas \na product of the stockmarket mania. They contributed to it, and they ate off it.\u201d.\u2019 (Brady \n2003). \nWhilst questions should be asked about the complex ethical conflicts and more subtle conflicts of \ninterest behind this \u2018bubble\u2019 journalism, most see financial journalism\u2019s weakness as cock up \nrather than conspiracy. Gillian Doyle (2006: 433) questions the level of training and skill among \nbusiness journalists. Many of the financial journalists she interviewed said that as financial \nproducts become more complex it is difficult to find journalists with the expertise to adequately \nunderstand the material they are reporting on. Aeron Davis\u2019 research, based on interviews with \nfund managers, brokers, and other interested parties in 2002-2004 similarly reports perception of \na lack of expertise and of critical reflection by journalists. (Davis 2007: 163-164).  \n \n 3 \nGillian Doyle argues that a lack of skills among journalists as markets become more complex \nundermine journalists\u2019 ability to hold companies to account. (Doyle 2006: 442). According to a \nnews editor interviewed by Doyle: \u2018financial journalists are generally good at analysing \ncompanies and interpreting and maintaining companies at arms length. Where they are less good, \nhowever, is in pro-actively investigating stories \u2013 in stepping back to see the wider picture and \nspotting things that deserve a closer look. This is because they don\u2019t have the time and the \nopportunity and perhaps the education and training needed to be more pro-active.\u2019 (Doyle 2006: \n442). Similarly, several financial journalists and editors I interviewed for this article raised the \nissue of the lack of specialist training for financial analysis. \u2018The people that are really skilled go \nand make loads of money working in the financial sector. Not writing about it\u2019 one respondent \nsaid.  \n \nThe challenges faced by financial journalists were well illustrated during 2007-9 when only a \nvery few individuals, notably Gillian Tett of the Financial Times, spotted the crisis coming. \nFinancial journalism is accused of giving a partial view of the business world. But is it a \ndistorted one? Do the financial media, as Peter Wilby (2007) asserts, \u2018present the world through \na middle aged, middle-class prism\u2019? Wilby\u2019s charge is that in reporting financial issues, for \nexample house prices, there is a tendency to frame issues as though what was \u2018good news\u2019 was \nuncontroversial. As those who wish to buy, but not sell houses know very well, price hikes are \nnot good news for everyone. For those journalists that aspire to \u2018public interest\u2019 coverage, just \nwhat interest should they serve is a very complex issue: should they serve investors? Or the \n\u2018rationality\u2019 of the market? Only exceptional individuals will actively want to be the one that \nburst the bubble. \n \nCritics of the current state of UK financial and business journalism thus tend to focus on the \nproblem of a skills and resources gap. And whilst the shifting relationship of power between \npolitical journalists and politicians is much discussed, (See John Lloyd (2004) and Nick Jones \n(1999) the similar standoff that occurs between financial journalists and their sources has been \nsubject to less discussion. One very real problem is that interested parties - including corporate \nexecutives and analysts - sometimes constitute the only repositories of relevant data and employ \n 4 \nthe main experts. With the help of proactive PR, information can be controlled despite the fact \nthat \u2013 as we have found \u2013 ultimately the financial system is a public matter that effects us all. \nDyck and Zingales describe the relationship between financial journalists and their sources in \nterms of a quid pro quo situation: access to information is granted; but only on condition that \nstories are presented in the required manner. (Dyck and Zingales 2003: 1-6). Sources exert their \ncontrol through granting\/denying of access, the potential for treating, threat of lawsuits. \n\u2018\u2026Corporations vie with each other for the attention of a target audience mostly composed of \ninvestors. In so doing, they dominate or \u2018capture\u2019 business and financial news agendas to the \nexclusion of all other interests.\u2019 (Doyle 2006: 435; see also Davis 2005).  \n \nThe charges levelled against current financial journalism: of capture and of superficiality, and of \nlack of skills, are of course based the assumption that financial journalists should play an \nindependent, \u2018watchdog\u2019 role. Since this is not a consensus view, even among journalists, it is \nworth making this explicit. Might the problem not be that markets are increasingly complex, or \nthat journalists are insufficiently funded? Perhaps business and financial journalists themselves \ndon\u2019t see themselves as engaged in \u2018public interest\u2019 reporting in the same way that political \njournalists do.  \n \nThe interviews conducted for this project, perhaps surprisingly, showed a large degree of \ndissensus on whether, and to what extent, business and financial journalists should seek to serve \na wider public interest. One way of examining this question theoretically is to ask what it is that \nour corporate governance structure asks of financial journalism. Obviously there are no formal, \nlegal responsibilities placed on journalists; but after high profile failures such as Enron and \nNorthern Rock, we might ask how financial journalism fits in to a general framework of checks \nand balances on business.  \n \n \n \n \n 5 \nFinancial journalism and corporate governance \n \nJoe, Louis and Robinson report a 2002 survey finding that US board members \u2018rank negative \npress as the greatest threat to corporate reputation, ahead of corporate unethical behaviour and \nlitigation\u2019. (Joe et al 2007: 4). Journalists thus have a potentially powerful position if they choose \nto hold companies to account. But whilst political journalists have a strong professional \ncommitment to exposing wrongdoing and corruption, our interviewees reported that the notion of \na watchdog role is less pronounced among business journalists, particularly where journalists see \ntheir main role as supplying investors with market relevant information.  \n \nUnderstanding the role of financial journalism in a broader system of corporate governance \nmeans understanding how financial journalism is involved in holding corporations to account, \nand informing the public about the risks of the financial system. Regulators of course hold \nbusinesses \u2013 including banks \u2013 to account, but they are the first to admit that they cannot regulate \nevery aspect of corporate behaviour. They rely also on the public and the media working to \nexpose wrongdoing and expose matters of public interest.  \n \nMichael Borden (2007) has analysed the role of financial journalists from the perspective of the \noverall system of corporate governance. His research focuses on the US but there seems to be no \nreason to expect the UK to differ. From this perspective, is has been argued (Klausner 2005, cit. \nBorden) that corporate law has inherent limitations and that in order to understand failures of \nregulatory systems, attention must turn to extralegal enforcement mechanisms. Borden\u2019s \napproach is to identify what he describes as \u2018gaps\u2019 in corporate law, arguing that the key issues \nof disclosure and investigation rely on the media. He sees the role of the media as: \u201cUncovering \nand deterring fraud, and acting as an informational intermediary that catalyzes and informs legal \naction by Congress, the SEC, the courts, shareholders, or private litigants\u201d. (Borden 2007: 315). \nAs Borden points out, journalists encounter conflicts of interest and challenges in relation to each \nof these roles.  I return to this issue below. \n \n 6 \nThis functional, systemic view of the role of financial journalists may well be rejected by \njournalists who invoke a narrow or market-based notion of their responsibilities. Several of the \njournalists interviewed for this research simply rejected the notion that they had such \u2018ethical\u2019 or \n\u2018social\u2019 responsibilities. These ethical minimalists saw their ultimate responsibility as being to \nrespect the law and serve the shareholders of their companies, not to plug gaps in the system of \ncorporate oversight.     \n          \nI will return to this disconnect between a systemic view of business journalism, and the reality of \nprofessional practice below. In the following section I shift perspective, looking at the direct and \npowerful impacts that financial news can have on market behaviour and the implications of this \nfor the regulation, role and responsibilities of financial journalists. \n \nThe effects of financial coverage: reflexivity and market impact \n\u201cKeynes compared financial markets to a beauty contest where the contestants\u2019 behaviour \nis based not only on their own beliefs but also on their expectations of the other \ncontestants beliefs\u2026 accordingly\u2026 the media is likely to play a disproportionate role in \nasset pricing\u201d. (Joe et al 2007: 2).  \nOne reason that a peculiar ethics and regulatory framework applies to financial journalism is that \nbusiness news can have a very direct and powerful impact on market behaviour \u2013 with the \u2018city \nslickers\u2019 case the most pungent recent reminder. On one hand, the fact that journalists may be in \na position to abuse their influence has led to detailed regulation, some of which will be examined \nin detail in the next section. On the other hand there is a more diffuse and less researched notion \nthat journalists should avoid \u2018panicking\u2019 markets, or contributing to irrational behaviour, a notion \nmuch debated after the Northern Rock debacle.  \nMeasurement of the impact of news on stock prices is a well established field of research which \ninvolves a number of distinct approaches. The research originates mainly in discussions about \nwhat makes markets move - rather than discussions about what impact changing media \ntechnologies might have. And there are specific literatures on policy issues such as central bank \ntransparency (Connolly and Kohler 2004; Reeves and Sawicki 2007). Some researchers treat \n 7 \nevents (announcements for example, release of information) as \u2018news\u2019, whilst others attempt to \nseparate out the fact of coverage in news media as the key variable, asking whether the fact of \ncoverage has an independent and measurable effect. (Connolly and Kohler 2004; Dyck and \nZingales 2003: 2).  \n \nThere is however a danger of media centrism: of prioritising the impact of media coverage \nbeyond the range of other factors on market outcomes. (See Dyck and Zingales 2003). Barber \nand Odean (2006) find that individual investors tend to be net buyers of shares on \u2018high attention \ndays\u2019. The important finding in this US-based research is that the tendency on such days is for \ninstitutional investors to be net sellers of those stocks whereas individual investors buy. The \nauthors hypothesise that this is due to the limited information available to investors and \u2018bounded \nrationality\u2019. Other research into the relationship between reporting and market behaviour \nexamined the market impact of a survey of the \u2018Worst Boards\u2019 published in Business Week in \nthe US. Interestingly the results showed positive short term share price gains even among \ncompanies identified as the worst boards. The short term gains did subsequently reverse however \n(Joe et al 2006: 19). Other authors concern themselves with the problem of what influences \ninvestment decisions and the extent to which news reporting might be a factor.  \n \nIt is useful to keep in mind these two systemic views of the role of financial journalists: first in \nterms of their role in corporate governance and secondly in terms of their role in relation to \nmarkets and particularly capital markets when considering the responsibilities of financial \njournalists. On one hand they indicate a wider watchdog role for journalists in the system of \ncorporate governance; and on the other they show that the reflexive nature of the relationship \nwith markets requires a particular ethical approach.  \n \nIn the following sections I describe financial journalism as a combination of various hard won \nrights and privileges that are granted in recognition of the social role that financial and business \njournalists are seen to play. This approach draws on Osiel\u2019s (1986) study of the \n 8 \nprofessionalisation of journalism in its understanding of the relationship between law, self \nregulation and professional practices. (See also Hallin and Mancini 2004)  Whilst journalists \nthemselves, particularly in the UK often reject the notion that they have institutionalized \nprofessional responsibilities, I argue that such a position is untenable as it is possible to \ndemonstrate that the legal and self-regulatory framework within which journalists work sets out \nand reinforces such responsibilities. In order to understand current challenges in the profession, it \nis useful to consider the longer term context: business and financial journalism has evolved a \nclear set of professional rights and responsibilities which reflect (i) the macro role of financial \njournalism in the broader system of corporate governance; (ii) the reflexive relationship between \nnews and markets and (iii) the codification of the resulting set of roles and responsibilities in law \nand self-regulatory codes.  \n \n \n \nFinancial Journalism, Regulation and the Law. Formal Duties of Journalists \n \nIn this section I will look at duties that are much clearer and less disputed than the broader \n\u2018ethical\u2019 responsibilities discussed above. My concern is with the legal obligations of business \nand financial journalists. In the following section I outline the legal privileges that apply to \nfinancial journalists. Here is an incomplete list of the main duties of financial journalists relating \nto market abuse:  \n \n \n \n 9 \n1. Insider Trading \nTrading on the basis of information that is not in the public domain. Notoriously hard to define, \nthis impacts journalists when they may be party to private information prior to publication, and \nmay at that point take part in trades that would be illegal. Under the Financial Services and \nMarkets Act: Market Abuse can involve \u2018behaviour (that) is based on information which is not \ngenerally available to those using the market but which, if available to a regular user of the \nmarket, would or would be likely to be regarded by him as relevant when deciding the terms on \nwhich transactions in investments of the kind in question should be effected\u2019 (s118.2.a). \n \n2. Market Manipulation \nOne variant of this, known as \u2018share ramping\u2019 was at the heart of the Daily Mirror\/ City Slickers \ncase. Because of the strong influence that certain media can have on prices, it is possible for \ncertain players to impact prices through recommendation and thereby profit by selling shares on \nin the short term. Readers who invest do so in inappropriately inflated stock and are likely to lose \nmoney when prices correct. \n \n3. Conflicts of Interest \nAll journalism has to face issues of conflict of interest, but such issues are particularly \npronounced in relation to financial journalism. The interest of the reader, investor or market may \nbe in conflict with the private interest of the journalist if for example the journalist or an \nassociate has a shareholding or some other stake in a company they are reporting on. The \ntemptation may be to withhold information that could hurt the company in question or publish \ninformation that favours it, or engage in profit-driven market manipulation.   \n \n4. Non disclosure \nWhere journalists do have an interest, they are obliged under relevant codes (such as the Market \nAbuse Directive) to disclose the identity of the producers of the recommendation, and any \ninterests that the producer might have in the recommended investment. Most established \n 10 \nfinancial news providers operate in addition a policy of internal disclosure whereby any stocks \nheld are disclosed to a key manager or editor who can monitor whether the journalist is as a \nresult placed in conflict of interest as regards stories that are covered by that journalist. \n \nFor each of these there are layers of overlapping regulation and self-regulation including: \n-the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 \n-Industry codes such as the PCC Code and Guidance on Financial Journalism \n-The Investment Recommendation (Media) Regulations 2005. (Statutory Instrument 2005 No \n382). \n \nThere are of course many other ethical issues. Some of these (such as accuracy, honesty) are \ncovered by general journalism ethics codes, and some are contained within specialist codes such \nas the Press Complaints Commissions\u2019 (PCC) 2005 Best Practice Note on Financial Journalism. \nIn addition, most established leaders in financial news have their own guidance and codes of \nconduct. These do cover issues relating to conflicts of interest, and independence of journalists, \nbut also deal with other issues such as whether stock tipping is encouraged and working for other \norganisations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 11 \nPrivileges of Financial Journalists \nThe law applied to journalists is in many respects the same as that applied to anyone else. But in \nsome respects the regime for journalists is different. On one hand, the courts rely on the self \nregulatory bodies such as the PCC to implement the rules, and this raises questions about the \nlevel of oversight and enforcement, particularly in the light of the extremely low level of PCC \nactivity in this area, and the fact that it is almost always complaints-driven.2 n the light of the \nexemptions for journalists by the Market Abuse Directive and the lack of PCC activity in this \narea, ethical responsibilities lie with journalists and their employers. Journalists were placed \noutside of the scope of some key aspects of the EC Market Abuse Directive- in recognition of the \nrole they play in corporate governance - and the fact that they operate their own codes of \nconduct. And on the other hand journalists do have some informal immunities (for example in \nterms of their ability to protect their sources) in the light of the role they play in corporate \ngovernance.  \nJournalists are therefore treated as a special case, and in the UK they enjoy a system of formal \nand informal regulatory and legal privileges. On one hand, because of the particular role that \nnews reporting plays, journalism is recognised in European Convention on Human Rights \njurisprudence as worthy of special protection. (Castendyck et al, 2008, p46). Whether the fact \nthat courts tend to afford a lower level of protection to commercial speech than political speech \nmay be relevant to the framework for financial journalism: it may be that journalists who are \nobviously fulfilling a public interest role are more protected by free speech rights. Where issues \nof free speech are likely to arise, in the UK as in the U.S, is in relation to source protection. \n(Osiel 1986). UK financial regulators have developed informal and formal procedures that go \nbeyond the protection afforded buy the European Court in terms for example of the protection of \nsources. This means that whilst non-journalists (and we might include bloggers in this category \u2013 \nthough this is less clear) could be obliged to reveal sources to a regulator, professional journalists \nunder the PCC or Ofcom regimes are much less likely to be. Research on the historical \nemergence of these privileges and duties is the subject of another paper, but it is useful to note \ntwo cases which illustrate the slow formalization of journalistic privilege in respect of one \njournalistic privilege: the right to protect sources.   \n \n 12 \nFollowing a 2006 dispute with the Wall St Journal over a case relating to Overstock.com, the \nU.S. regulator formalized its approach to working with journalists. Policy Document SEC 34-\n53638 sets out a set of rules and procedures that the SEC should follow before they subpoena a \njournalist to force her to reveal her sources. SEC officials should: try to obtain information first \nfrom alternative sources, determine if the information really is essential to the case, and should \ncontact the journalist\u2019s legal counsel in the first instance rather than the journalist directly, in \norder to ascertain how important the information is, and the extent to which other sources have \nbeen exhausted. In announcing this new doctrine the SEC director was quick to point out that the \nSEC strongly supported freedom of the press. Cox argued that his agency \u201crelies on aggressive \ninvestigative journalism to uncover wrongdoing in companies. Therefore, the SEC should do \nnothing to chill that work.\u201d Cox said \u201cFinancial journalists need to understand that the SEC \nconsiders them vital partners in our mission.\u201d (Orange County Register March 6 2006). \n \nIn the UK, the equivalent moment in which a line in the regulatory sand was drawn was in \nrelation to the Interbrew case, in which The Guardian found itself in contempt of court after \nrefusing to hand over documents relating to a leaked story about a merger involving a large \ndrinks company. In this case too, the regulator (UK regulator the FSA) established a doctrine \nrelating to protection of sources, but, in the case of the UK, this remains informal and unwritten.  \n \nBoth regulators, in establishing these doctrines, recognised the public interest functions that \njournalists can play, such as holding companies to account and investigating illegal behaviour. \nInsofar as they do provide these benefits they should be helped by regulators rather than \nhindered, for example, by scaring off potential sources; hence journalists are granted privileges \nof source protection.3  \n \nProtection of sources is only one aspect of the privileges that are extended to financial journalists \nin recognition \u2013 and this is the crucial point \u2013 of their role in corporate governance and the wider \npublic interest. The majority of privileges that financial journalists enjoy are in fact those \n 13 \nenjoyed by all journalists, and include the notion of qualified privilege as reflected in the \n\u2018Reynolds defence\u2019 in defamation cases. In a defamation case brought by the Prime Minister of \nIreland against the Sunday Times, it was established that journalists should be permitted protection of \nspeech if they worked ethically: if journalists work without malice, on a matter of public interest and were \nnot reckless. Lord Nicholls set out a ten point test of privilege, adding that: \u201cThe press discharges vital \nfunctions as a bloodhound a well as a watchdog. The court should be slow to conclude that a publication \nwas not in the public interest and, therefore, the public had no right to know especially when the \ninformation is in the field of political discussion. Any lingering doubts should be resolved in favour of \npublication.\u201d  Whilst judges do tend to err on the side of free speech, the key implication here is whether \nfinancial journalists that reject both bloodhound and watchdog roles should enjoy privilege, and whether \nbloggers and others might also benefit. \n \nSo whilst interviews for this project uncovered a somewhat patchy notion among journalists of \nany social or ethical responsibility to act in a watchdog role, it is in recognition of this role that \njournalistic privileges have been granted. What is implied in this: whether rights and duties \nmight be conditional on one another for example is a question that is too broad to be addressed in \nthis short article. The interviews conducted for the project took sought to elucidate exactly how \njournalists viewed their role, and the challenges they faced in the attempt to fulfil it. It is to this \nmaterial that we now turn.  \n \n \n \n \n 14 \nKey challenges for financial Journalism  \nBetween September 2007 and July 2008 researchers conducted more than 30 in-depth interviews \nwith leading business and financial journalists, their editors and their lawyers4. The research \nfocused primarily on the UK, with some US material included for comparison. The aim was to \ninvestigate the ethical and professional concerns of financial and business journalists, and the \nviews of professionals on the key challenges facing the profession. The following sections of this \npaper report on the journalists\u2019 views of these key challenges. \nSome of the challenges facing financial journalism are not new. The need for enhanced training \nand skills for financial journalists, and the unremitting daily struggle to treat stories with \nappropriate scepticism are the enduring themes of the trade, dating back to the emergence of \nfinancial journalism in the mid 20th century. But according to those interviewed for this report, \nnew communications technology adds to these pressures and poses new challenges. \n \nSpeed \nPressure for increased productivity has led to journalists writing more stories in less time than \nbefore. Some things have got easier, such as the availability of data online and accessibility of \nsources, but, on the other hand, the expectation is that material will be published as soon as \npossible, regardless of print deadlines or broadcast bulletins. Most journalists agree that this \nleads to intense professional pressures: both in terms of the degree of senior editorial oversight \nbefore publication and in terms of the extent to which additional sources can be accessed and \nverification standards maintained. Many respondents claimed that journalists were forced as a \nresult to rely on a narrower range of established news sources such as PR companies. \n 15 \nAccording to the editor of a web-based business news service: \u201cour readers want information at \n6.00, 7.00 or 8.00 in the morning. \u2026 On the newspaper the moment when a piece of news has \nbeen delivered to, say, the news editor, it\u2019ll go through the whole process of \u2026 news editing, sub \nediting, copy proof, whatever, go through that process and sending to the print site, put it on the \npage. That\u2019ll take 2, 3 hours, OK (on our site), because we\u2019re a very small team using quick, \nlight, web-based technology, the production process takes about 2 or 3 minutes. So, it\u2019s fast, \nultra-fast. That again changes the way you write.\u201d \n \nThe processes through which facts are verified, judgements of news value reached, and reports \nare selected for publication are likely to have significant consequences for individual companies, \ninvestors, employees and potentially for the broader economy. There is a trade-off between \nspeed and attention to ethics and it is one where financial journalism has yet to find a new \nequilibrium of accepted practices. Getting the balance wrong could lead to Financial Journalism \nas a profession becoming irrelevant. According to a leading Fund Manager: \u201cThere is this \u2026 \nvicious downward circle: you have fewer journalists paid less with less time and they don\u2019t have \nthe luxury of spending the time you need to come up with information that is required. So it \nbecomes less useful to people like me. We ignore it increasingly and it becomes sort of \nmarginalised.\u201d These pressures of time are not peculiar to business journalists, but are of course \nwidely noted tendencies of contemporary journalism. Coupled with some of the other trends \nreported by interviewees however the increased pressures on journalists\u2019 time may be \nundermining the ability of business and financial journalists to fulfil an effective public interest \nfunction. \n 16 \n \nComplexity \nFinancial stories are more complex and specialist than ever before. In the hand wringing \nfollowing the collapse of Enron, some journalists admitted that the degree of complexity in the \nstructure of Enron\u2019s business baffled them. Those covering the Credit Crunch and the Northern \nRock stories also required specialist knowledge if they were to form an independent view. The \nlack of skills of this type among journalists adds to the reliance on intermediaries and news \nprofessionals to \u2018interpret\u2019 and explain stories for journalists.   \n \nAccording to BBC Business Editor Robert Peston, the financial media could have done more to \nforesee some of the problems resulting from the credit crunch and complexity is part of the \nproblem: \u201cThe financial press has typically focused too much on equity markets and not enough \non debt markets... For many months, I was very concerned about the explosive growth of CDOs \n(Collateralized Debt Obligations) and I tried to explain them through my reporting. Doing so was \na challenge, when even bankers creating the CDOs were unable to describe them in terms that \nmake sense to non-specialists.\u201d5 \nWhilst non-journalist stakeholders agreed that complexity was a problem, there was some dissent \nfrom this view in the interviews conducted with journalists. Perhaps because of professional \npride, they tended to point to some of the strengths and successes of the profession. Others were \nmore ready to argue that the complexity of business and financial markets is putting a strain on \nreporting. \n 17 \n \nStrategy \nIncreasing pressures of speed, complexity and productivity add to the constant challenge for \njournalists: namely to ensure that they are not used in the service of someone else\u2019s interests, but \nreport in the public interest or at least the interests of their readers. Business and financial PR has \nbecome much more important in the field in recent years.  \n \nProfessional strategy advice, in the form of financial PR has become a high margin, rapid growth \nindustry in recent decades. In 1986, British companies spent \u00a337m on financial PR.  A decade \nlater the annual figure had risen to \u00a3250m. (Michie, 1998: 26). The evidence is that the past \ndecade has seen similar or perhaps larger rates of growth. Industry sources estimate that financial \nPR consultancies can command fees up to 1 percent of the bid values in M+A deals (Miller et al. \n2000).  \nThe current credit crisis is considered to be the greatest challenge of the industry and the \nprofessionals predict that the merger business will pick up only at the end of the decade. Even so, \nthe financial PR industry as a whole managed a revenue increase in 2007. On PR Week\u2019s top 150 \nUK PR consultancies league, listed companies\u2019 fee income saw an average 22 percent increase \n(PR Week, 2008).  The industry is dominated by a few agencies. Brunswick tops the league in \nMergermarket\u2019s 2006 table of pan-European PR advisers after advising on 146 deals worth \n\u00a3177.8bn. Brunswick, the largest financial PR company in the UK had almost a third of FTSE \n 18 \n100 Companies on its books. Finsbury, Financial Dynamics, Citigate and Maitland hold the spots \nfrom the second to the fifth, all advising on deals worth over \u00a3100bn. \nOne Editor with a long experience in the UK saw the rise of financial PR as the single most \nimportant change to have taken place in recent years:  \n\u201cIn the last ten, twenty years I suppose the biggest change has been the rise of the financial \nintermediary, financial public relations services.  They are putting up barriers to information. I \nthink they were always around but they\u2019ve developed and become much more sophisticated. \nWhen I first came across them they were really kind of press cutting services. But now they are \nreally strategy advisors. And there are some company directors that do not talk or answer phone \ncalls without consulting them. And they have enormous power. In many ways, they set the \nagenda. They are the access point. They are making these people available for interviews or they \ndon\u2019t make them available for interviews. They release information in a, what\u2019s the word, in a \nway which is carefully orchestrated to happen. [\u2026] Things are very controlled in a way \ncompared with the way it used to be....  the free flow of information has been interrupted and the \nkind of information we get can be very sanitized. It\u2019s very hard getting to the bottom of a story.\u201d \n \nOne former Financial PR professional claimed that there was increasing co-dependency between \nPR and journalists, as journalists are under time pressure to get stories, and PR now controls \naccess to the larger companies that control most of the larger stories: \u201cthe papers couldn\u2019t exist \nwithout financial PRs pushing stories to them everyday because they just don\u2019t have many \nstories.\u201d  \n 19 \n \nJournalists are of course aware of such strategies. The business editor of a national newspaper \nadmitted: \u201cI love the leaks. Some of the leaks are obviously done to protect insider shares or to \nmanipulate the share price. There is no question in my mind about that. But it is much more \ndifficult to do today than ten years ago\u201d. There is a clash here between different aspects of \nprofessional and ethical responsibility on the part of the journalist. The journalist must get the \nstory, and the leak is great news from that point of view. Presumably, if the story is big enough, \nwho cares that the journalist is being put to instrumental use. In that context, the journalist may \nreason, perhaps the fewer questions asked about why the leak has been made, the better. \n \nThe more seasoned journalists reveal a distaste for dealing with PR when pressed on the matter. \n\u201cBecause if PR give it to you it means they want something. I don\u2019t particularly like it. If people \ngive me stories I will be happy but I will stand them up. I try not to be used or manipulated. I \ndon\u2019t want to be used. A lot of PR companies try to trade with journalists so it is always very \nsubtle. They say \u2018we will give you this now\u2019 then they might want something nice written about \ntheir clients. It does happen. But I don\u2019t like it.\u201d  \n \nAccording to one former editor of a national newspaper: \u201csome financial PRs simply tell \nwhoppers. \u2026 Friendship is a potential corruptor so PR must be kept at arms\u2019 length.\u201d London \nfinancial news is particularly susceptible to capture by PR according to one financial journalist \nwho had worked in several countries \u201cpeople are spoon-fed here in London. The financial PR \n 20 \nindustry is very developed. In Hong Kong journalists have direct access to people operating in \nthe market\u201d \u2026 \u201cPR can be a big problem for journalists. They [PR] selectively release \ninformation and then can block any further access. They can deny access to company briefings, \nAGMs and profit warning briefings\u201d  \n \nThis would seem to support Gillian Doyle\u2019s description of business news production: \n\u2018\u2026corporations vie with each other for the attention of a target audience mostly composed of \ninvestors. In so doing, they dominate or \u2018capture\u2019 business and financial news agendas to the \nexclusion of all other interests\u2019 (Doyle 2006: 435; see also Davis 2005).   \n \nWhilst problems of spin and bias do create challenges for journalists; one very real problem is \nthat interested parties - including corporate executives and analysts -  do sometimes constitute \nthe main repositories of data and the main experts. Dyck and Zingales describe the relationship \nbetween financial journalists and their sources in terms of a quid pro quo situation, and one \nanalogous to recent critical views of political journalism: Access to information is granted; but \nonly on condition that stories are presented in the required manner. (Dyck and Zingales 2003: 1-\n6).  \n \n 21 \nThe combination of increasing complexity and increasing impact of communications \nprofessionals is a powerful double whammy for financial journalists. According to a leading \nbusiness editor:  \n \n\u201c Well, I think, you know, there is a risk that any journalist can swallow lines from the \n[\u2026]public relations people and so on but you need to be sceptical. But you know it\u2019s about \npicking all the information hopefully from the source, and not to take it all so seriously \n \nInterviewer: With all the complexity you talked about, has it become more difficult to do that? \nEditor: It is more difficult. Yeah. But, you know, there is a lot of going on which you don\u2019t \nunderstand and which we can\u2019t get at because of that complexity. That does make it a bit harder. \nBut you know, what we are reporting on most of the time is takeovers, and companies\u2019 results, \nregular trading statements, and so on. We are all writing about the same statement. You need to \nask all the right questions. [\u2026]\u201d \nSustainability: Business Models for Financial and Business News \nMany interviewees harked back to a golden age of financial journalism in which a few players \n(the Financial Times in London; the Wall St Journal in New York) enjoyed a privileged \nmonopoly provision as specialist business news providers. Supported by \u2018tombstone\u2019 \nannouncement advertising by large corporate clients and steady sales, with little serious \ncompetition, times were easy. In the protected environment the professional ethics and \n 22 \nresponsibility of the profession were fostered and there was the financial stability to fund more \ninvestigations and longer term risks. \n \nThe contemporary scene is quite different according to those interviewed. Competition from new \nentrants, some driven by new technology, and specialist subscription news and information \nterminals such as those provided by Bloomberg and Reuters have long ago upset the comfortable \nmonopoly of the business press. Increasingly, previously bundled services providing data, \ninformation, news, analysis and comment are unbundled. Much of the value derived in financial \nand business news, particularly in the press, is now in analysis and comment rather than data, \ninformation and news, as updates are provided around the clock and, increasingly, as a free \nservice online. Many of the journalists interviewed stressed that there is still considerable doubt \nabout the sustainability of new business models for financial journalism in the new competitive \nenvironment. Intensified competition leads to questions about what in fact the market will \nprovide. Whilst demand for quality business news remains high and business news readers\u2019 \ndemographics are valuable to advertisers, some aspects of business journalism may suffer. In \nparticular, expensive and risky ventures such as investigations are seen as increasingly difficult \nto fund: \n\u2018The huge investment of energy and uncertain outcome associated with investigative reporting \nmeans that, for most financial media in the UK at least, this is supported only on an occasional \nbasis rather than as a routine activity. So long as this remains the case, the opportunities for \nmedia to play a role in uncovering frauds such as Enron will be limited.\u2019 (Doyle 2005: 443). \n 23 \nA senior editor of a national UK Financial news outlet agreed that: \n\u201cPutting two or three people onto a project for a month where at the end of it you might get \nnothing in terms of material is something that we would think very hard about doing, because it \nis expensive. (\u2026) We used to have a small investigative unit, we don\u2019t really anymore.\u201d \n \nA lack of resources would seem likely to impact quality and, in particular, accuracy. Standards of \nverification and sourcing vary outlet by outlet. Very few outlets will commit to the industry gold \nstandard of two named sources for each story \u2013 for the simple reasons that sometimes one person \nin the right position is enough to verify a story, particularly if it involves that person - and time is \nscarce. It appeared that journalists are aware of the market impact of their reporting \u2013 both its \nimpact on individual companies and on market sentiment more broadly. When journalists were \nquestioned about whether this would effect their verification of a story there was a mixed \nresponse. Some indicated that they might be less inclined to publish a story at all until they were \nvery sure of its veracity if they thought it may have an immediate impact on job losses for \ninstance. Others admitted that they might be inclined to adopt higher verification standards if the \nstory was likely to have an immediate market impact.  \n \nRegulation and Information \nDefamation law was singled out as a key problem by several of those interviewed, as was the \nproblem of the lack of publicly available information. Reform of the UK\u2019s plaintiff-friendly \n 24 \ndefamation law is a demand made by all journalists, not just business journalists. But many argue \nthat business journalism faces particular challenges, in part, because of the imbalance of \nresources between struggling media companies and large companies with larger budgets for legal \nfees. \n \nThe law impacts not only in relation to structuring the profile of liability risk for publishers. It \nalso structures the access to the basic materials that journalists transform into news. According to \none interviewee, \u201cone of the key challenges for financial journalists is access to information\u201d. In \nthe view of these journalists \u201cwhat is publicly available information in the UK that journalists \ncan get hold of does not compare well to the US or any other country. That surely has a role to \nplay in relation to financial journalism.\u201d Whilst freedom of information law has had an impact on \naccess to data held by public authorities, journalists need better access also to that held by private \nbodies. \n \nProfessional Closure: Who is the Financial Journalist? \nTo claim that the status of the business journalist comes with rights and responsibilities begs the \nquestion \u201cwho is a financial journalist\u201d? Whilst in the past it was relatively clear who was a \nfinancial\/business journalist since they worked for the established news media, the rise of \nbloggers, social media, new kinds of newsletters and other news services, undermines the \ninformal professional definitions. There has always been pseudo journalism in the form of tip \nsheets, rumour reports, and newsletters, and many bloggers do aspire to being financial \n 25 \njournalists, describing themselves as such, but existing outside the ethical and professional \u2013 and \nto an extent, legal - constraints of the profession. The results of the interviews suggest that \nfinancial and business journalism is more than a job, or an activity.  Like other specialist beats it \nis a set of rules of thumb, formal rules and an ethical attitude, albeit one that varies in some \nrespects between outlets and a great deal between countries. \n \nOnline financial news should be separated between online versions and initiatives of old media \u2013 \nwhich tend to observe the same codes and standards; and pure play online financial news and \ninformation. This latter group appears to exist outside the existing framework. \n \nWhere broadcasting and newspapers once were the crucial media in terms of their market \nimpact, new media now play a significant part. One editor recounts the case of a report on a \nrumour on his purely online news messaging service:  \n \n\u201cThere are rumours of private equity interest in a company called X. Now if it was true that the \nprivate equity group was going to buy X it would be on the front page of the newspaper because \nit would be confirmed, checked news. It would be a big story. But at the moment it is just among \nthe market chatter. So, traditionally, this sort of information would be within the market reports. \n\u2026 Because we are working online in this IM format, we print the same material but it HAS \ninstant effects. Normally, the story which comes to the newspaper is printed in the middle of the \n 26 \nnight, turned over by the news wires. By the morning, people can take a view, a quite leisurely \nview on whether it\u2019s true or not true. Or the story might have moved on in some way. When you \nprint it live in IM conversation, nobody has anytime to check. And so the story can have a sort of \nexaggerated effect in terms of moving the prices. That brings with it huge responsibilities. \nBecause if the story is wrong you can be moving prices falsely. If you say something is true \nwhich is not true. (\u2026) And it means you have to be 100 percent squeaky clean. Because people \nautomatically believe you can be guilty of manipulating the stock market. So you have to be \ncompletely open. You have to write your doubts of the story. (\u2026)  You have to be make it very \nclear to the reader what sorts of information you are talking about, how firm the information is \nand literally you have to tell the reader everything you know. If there\u2019s any sense you\u2019re holding \nback the information you immediately look like you are manipulating the market in some way. \nYou might be actually doing anything bad but the perception would still be there. That means we \ncould never be seen to have any investment of our own.  \nInterviewer: So you have to be very clean. \nEditor: One hundred percent, squeaky clean. \nInterviewer: That means you don\u2019t own any stocks. \nEditor: No. I only have debts.\u201d \n \nThe site being discussed is in fact subject to the PCC code as these kinds of sites are operated by \na national newspaper. Others are not, and as the interviewee acknowledges, this could lead to \n 27 \npushing the regulatory and ethical boundaries. \u201cWe abide by all the values which go with this \nnewspaper\u2026. Yet at some point, somebody\u2026 if (the site) sat under someone else\u2019s umbrella, we \ncould be abused because the technology allows you to speak to a lot of people.\u201d The implicit \nassumption here is that the (self) regulatory framework that professional print and broadcast \njournalists are subject to is an effective foil against abuse of journalistic power, for example \nthrough market abuse. There is a need for more clarity about who is operating within the \nprofessional and ethical framework of financial journalism, particularly with regard to internet \ncontent. \n \n \nConclusions \nFinancial and business journalists, like other journalists, sometimes deny that they are part of an \norganised \u2018profession\u2019. But this paper has sought to show that whilst financial journalists are \nreluctant to accept it, they do have a clear institutional role in the broader financial system. A \nsimple way to understand this role is to see it as a framework of rights and duties that have been \ndeveloped in the context of legal and regulatory disputes and which form the institutional \nframework which governs and shapes professional practice. In return for the social function they \nperform, financial journalists are granted professional privileges. \nInterviews conducted for this research support the view that many financial and business \njournalists lack awareness about the professional and institutional framework they operate \nwithin. They hold a range of opinions about their ethical responsibilities and broader governance \n 28 \nrole. Interviewees\u2019 responses also show that financial journalism is under intense pressure \nbecause of the challenges of increased complexity of financial and business news, together with \nindustry changes that put pressure on the funding of investigations and the time available to \nprofessionals in fulfilling their duties. The powerful role that strategic PR has come to play in the \nfinancial and business journalism sector constitutes another key challenge. And in addition the \nprofession faces two key strategic questions. One is how to respond to the question of \nprofessional closure as bloggers and other new media services compete with established financial \nnews sources. Another is the question of what role financial news journalism seeks in the broader \nsettlement for corporate governance. As the regulatory response to the financial crisis of 2007-9 \nis designed, debate on the appropriate balance between legal and extralegal enforcement will \nentail a debate about the role of public \u2013 and therefore journalistic - oversight. The privileges \nextended to financial journalists \u2013 and the duties that are expected in return \u2013should be part of \nthat debate. \n \nThis could be an opportunity to revisit a broader debate about what role journalists should play in \nthe overall framework of corporate governance: not only unearthing cases of fraud, but providing \nthe balanced and sceptical news and comment that deflates bubbles and helps avoid market \nirrationality. In the current environment, pressures of time and resources are in danger of \nundermining business journalism in general, and the ability of financial journalists to find a way \nthrough the current impasse. The long-standing pressures on business journalism, such as \nsustainability, source dependency and pressure from PR, are exacerbated by the economic \npressures that undermine risk taking, together with the increased complexity of financial markets \n 29 \nand the pressure for rapid publication. The response to this impasse was beyond the scope of the \ninterviews conducted for this phase of the research, but we might speculate about possible ways \nforward. Journalists could respond by seeking regulatory support to enable them to fulfil their \nrole \u2013 for example by reducing defamation risk. Radical solutions are being discussed about new \nways of funding journalism, and these will inevitably entail judgements about what constitutes \ngood journalism, and whether business journalism qualifies. Given the range of the challenges \nthey face, journalists will need to work together and pool resources if they are to strike a new \ncompact about their rights and duties in the new environment, and to whom these rights and \nduties should be extended. \n 30 \n \nBibliography \nBarber, Brad M. and Odean, Terrance (2006). \u201cAll that Glitters: The Effect of Attention and \nNews on the Buying Behavior of Individual and Institutional Investors\u201d.

I am grateful to \nCharlie Beckett, director of Polis and the participants in two workshops organized by Polis for comments. I am also \ngrateful for Isabelle Cao Lijun, Terence Kiff, Eva Knoll, Judy Lin and Gladys Tang for research assistance. \n2 Interviews were carried out with the PCC director and data on official complaints reveals a lack of complaints \nagainst this article of the code. In the first 10 Months of 2007, there were two complaints: one did not breach the \nCode and the other was dropped by the complainant. In 2006 there were 3, of which 2 did not breach the Code and 1 \nwas dropped.  In 2005 there were 4, two of which were not pursued by the complainant while 2 accepted some offer \nof action by the editor. (Information supplied by the PCC). \n3 I am grateful for information provided by former Wall St Journal general counsel Stuart Karle and Howard Davies, \nDirector LSE and former Director, Financial Services Authority. \n4 Methodological note: Semi- structured interviews were conducted mainly by the author, and some were conducted \nby researchers working with him according to a semi structured interview guide focusing on the role of the business \njournalist and challenges faced in performing that role. They lasted between 30 and 65 minutes and were recorded \nand transcribed. Transcripts were analysed for the main themes they focused on, and the key challenges identified \nform the structure of the following report. Interviewees consisted of the most senior financial and business \njournalists in the UK, some of whom requested anonymity which has been granted to all interviewees for \nconsistency. The list of interviewees is available from the author. (Additional comparative material has been \nprovided as background from interviews conducted with financial journalists in New York and Hong Kong which \nwill be published separately).  \n5 Robert Peston quotes are from an interview conducted by Terence Kiff for an MSc dissertation, Department of \nMedia and Communications, London School of Economics.
