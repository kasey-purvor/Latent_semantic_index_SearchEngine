It concentrates on the family papers \nof William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, their daughter Mary Wollstonecraft \nShelley, and her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley. As Stephen Hebron, the curator, \nexplains in his accompanying volume, the exhibition is not \u201ca biography of these \ngreat literary figures, nor a critical appraisal of their work.\u201d Instead, it displays \n\u201cthe manuscripts on which so many biographies and critical appreciations have \nbeen based, and explores how these manuscripts were either published or with-\nheld by their owners in an attempt to shape the family\u2019s reputation\u201d (13). The \nexhibition begins with papers relating to Wollstonecraft\u2019s marriage and death, \nespecially Godwin\u2019s notoriously candid Memoir of her life and work. The outrage \nthat greeted this memoir leads the viewer to another publishing scandal thirteen \nyears later, Percy Shelley\u2019s expulsion from Oxford for writing The Necessity of \nAtheism. The exhibition\u2019s focus then turns to the complex and enthralling personal \nlives of the Godwin-Shelley circle: interwoven and sensational tales of elopements, \nsuicides, illegitimate children, fatal accidents, financial hardship, and\u2014lest we \nforget\u2014exceptional literary productivity. Alongside letters and relics documenting \nthese events are manuscripts and notebooks containing drafts, sketches, and col-\nEighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 45, No. 1178\nlaborations by the Shelleys and their associates. The rest of the exhibition details \nsubsequent attempts to honor and control the Shelleys\u2019 posthumous images, first \nby Mary herself following her husband\u2019s death, and later by her daughter-in-law \nLady Jane Shelley, who worked tirelessly to craft a family history and image fit for \nthe Victorians and later posterity. \nShelley\u2019s Ghost therefore engages with the central practices of exhibiting: \nhow the politics of choosing, displaying, preserving, and even destroying texts and \nother materials can service particular interpretations of people and their histories. \nEvidently, there are important questions here for historical, literary, and biographi-\ncal studies, specifically how the deployment and presentation of certain kinds of \nevidence can affect not simply the assessment of literary import or the construction \nof an individual life story but also the comprehension of \u201cthe past\u201d in broader \nterms. When gazing at relics from Lady Shelley\u2019s \u201cShelley Sanctum\u201d\u2014locks of \nhair, jewelry, cutlery\u2014one wonders what exactly is being memorialized by these \nobjects? The lives of famous literary figures, elevated to pseudo-sainthood by the \nvery preservation of their inconsequential trinkets? The sensibilities of Lady Shelley \nherself, determined to celebrate, crystallize, and disseminate her personal rever-\nence and familial pride? Or do the objects reveal wider late-nineteenth-century \npresumptions about the proper interpretation of the past and its actors: attention \nto personal material possessions, legitimate genealogy and aristocratic descent, \nand sanctioned histories authorized and framed by the guardians of the necessary \nevidence? Shelley\u2019s Ghost invites us to contemplate the overlapping complexities \nof these issues, not least because it requires a certain self-consciousness about \nthe nature of exhibition-going. It encourages us to see the objects viewed and the \npractices of viewing them as dually implicated in interpretative processes. When \nwe see the Sanctum relics, we are looking at a Victorian individual\u2019s understand-\ning of a more distant past, but we do so through the additional filter of our own \ntwenty-first-century predilections and perspectives, especially the trappings of \na modern celebrity culture that values biographical exposure (34). Throughout \nShelley\u2019s Ghost, understanding lives and letters is never a straightforward matter. \nOne of the exhibition\u2019s key themes is that members of the Godwin-Shelley \ncircle consciously conducted and constructed their lives through both writing itself \nand the collection and presentation of documents. This point is first evident in God-\nwin\u2019s relationship with Wollstonecraft. The couple \u201cpreferred to live independently \nand communicated, to an unusual extent, by correspondence,\u201d sending each other \nletters on a daily basis and sometimes delivering them personally (29). Their rela-\ntionship was a textual one, and the exhibition and book contain many examples, \nfrom long letters of intimacy, sympathy, and disagreement, to dashed-off notes on \nthe writer\u2019s health and frame of mind. After Wollstonecraft\u2019s death, Godwin both \npreserved and managed her legacy by editing her texts, as well as through his re-\nmarkably revealing Memoir of her earlier life and loves. The fact that this volume \nattracted such heavy criticism and disgust\u2014Robert Southey accused Godwin of \n\u201cstripping his dead wife naked\u201d (34)\u2014highlights contemporary controversy, not \njust about Wollstonecraft herself but also about the correct way to memorialize \nthe dead, understand the past, and deploy textual evidence. Godwin believed that \nwritten texts are the foundations of one\u2019s reputation and self-presentation: he \nscrupulously preserved his own papers, and in one autobiographical fragment\u2014\npresumably intended for posterity\u2014he asked to be judged \u201cby his writing, not his \nlife\u201d (126). For the same reason, he was unafraid to winnow the archival records: he \ndestroyed, for example, an unpublished comic play by Wollstonecraft, considering \nit \u201cmost respectful to her memory to commit it to the flames\u201d (35). \nExhibition Review 179\nAn adjacent display reveals Percy Shelley\u2019s comparable propensity for defin-\ning one\u2019s self (or selves) through the written word. The documents of his early career \nalternate between insistent self-mythologization and a retreat from straightforward \nbiographical emphasis through anonymous and pseudonymous publication. These \nvariant attitudes to authorship are often concurrent, which suggests some degree \nof experimentation in self-presentation across different genres and contexts. Like \nhis early gothic novels and political pamphlets, The Necessity of Atheism was \npublished anonymously, though in a post-expulsion letter to his father Shelley \nadopts what would become a familiar mode, casting himself as the protagonist \nin a heroic drama, beset by \u201ctyrannical violent proceedings.\u201d Later documents in \nthe exhibition reveal the pressures and tribulations of living a life through letters. \nMary Shelley\u2019s preface to Frankenstein exposes her and her husband\u2019s anxiety \nthat \u201cI should prove myself worthy of my parentage and enrol myself on the page \nof fame\u201d (89). And the Shelleys also suffered from rumor-mongering and public \nattacks, in both the press and private correspondence: witness the reviewers who \ndismissed Percy\u2019s work on the grounds of his \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cunmanly\u201d private \nlife (44). In the light of this reception, Lady Shelley\u2019s stringent attempts to sculpt a \nmore positive image for the family, most obviously her determination to exonerate \nPercy\u2019s abandonment of his first wife Harriet, need not be understood simply as a \ncampaign to distill the Shelleys\u2019 radicalism and unconventionality into acceptable \nVictorian wholesomeness. Instead it can be seen partly as a continuation of earlier \ninterests in how the presentation and reception of texts can shape public image and \nself-understanding. Lady Shelley\u2019s close guardianship of the family papers might \nseem excessively cautious and controlling: her privately printed Shelley and Mary \n(1882) was subject to a forty-year embargo at the Bodleian notwithstanding its \nheavily bowdlerized contents. But this has important\u2014if less insistent\u2014precedents, \nnot only in Godwin\u2019s conduct but also in the way Mary Shelley elided Percy\u2019s politics \nin her own editions of his work, a measure adopted to placate her conservatively \nminded father-in-law.\nAs all this implies, a closely related theme of Shelley\u2019s Ghost is compe-\ntition over legacy and memory. The exhibition explores several key instances, \nfrom Mary Shelley\u2019s role as executor for her husband\u2019s and father\u2019s papers in the \nface of private hostility, to Lady Shelley\u2019s travails in finding a family biographer \nwilling to publish in harmony with her views. Indeed, many of Percy and Mary\u2019s \nassociates\u2014Thomas Hogg, Thomas Peacock, and Edward Trelawny\u2014fell from \nfavor precisely because they declined to conform with those requirements and \ninsisted upon publishing rival accounts. These disputes led Lady Shelley into some \ncurious arguments, such as her counterintuitive belief that only family members \ncould fully and impartially assess the extant evidence. There was even recourse \nto spiritualism: the exhibition contains samples of Lady Shelley\u2019s automatic writ-\ning, in which Mary\u2019s spirit allegedly vindicates her daughter-in-law\u2019s methods and \nconclusions. It would be easy to dismiss this as desperately self-serving, but there \nare nonetheless important questions about how one\u2019s perspective can affect the \ncomprehension\u2014and even the definition\u2014of evidence in different periods and \ncontexts. The exhibition also reminds us that literary and biographical legacies \ncan be weapons in wider ideological disputes. From Godwin and Wollstonecraft \nonwards, the Shelley family members were enveloped in debates about morality \nand social convention, becoming protagonists and proxies in the tense politics of \npost-French Revolutionary Britain. Later, in the 1890s, the Shelley Memorial at \nUniversity College Oxford was designed as a tableau of redemption; by recasting \nPercy as an angelic victim, it tried to embody changing moral and literary ideas \nand reject the value judgments of the past.\nEighteenth-Century Studies Vol. 45, No. 1180\nThe above remarks might imply that Shelley\u2019s Ghost focuses predominantly \non familial affairs. To some extent this is indeed the case, though the effect may \nbe explained and amplified by our own attitudes to fame and celebrity, which \ntend to focus disproportionately on the intrigues of personal affairs, and which \nperhaps originated in the early-nineteenth-century cults of Lord Byron and Napo-\nleon Bonaparte. Nonetheless, there are two potential problems here: first, that the \nliterary and intellectual achievements of the circle are obscured behind accounts \nof family sensation and tragedy; and second, that our contemporary perspectives \nmight blur with those of the Shelleys and their memorialists. The exhibition records \nvarious reshapings of the Shelley image, but to what extent does it reshape and \nreorientate in its own right? Are we looking through a mirror to our own celebrity \nculture as much as connecting with the aesthetic and biographical concerns of the \npast? These are not easy questions to answer because they require us to step outside \nthe perceptions that frame our own ways of seeing. At times the exhibition and \nthe book place almost too great an emphasis on biography by seeing the work as \nan index to the life. Percy\u2019s poem Epipsychidion, for example, is interpreted as \nan autobiographical allegory, and lines from Frankenstein are used to illuminate \nMary Shelley\u2019s own mental state (73\u201374, 111). There is a double interpretative trap \nhere: too much biographical context and one simply sees literature as an authorial \ndiary; too little and one risks ignoring the circle\u2019s own preoccupation with self-\npresentation and legacies. But the exhibition\u2019s overall purpose hints at a solution: \nto reinvigorate self-reflexive understanding of biography without succumbing to \nthe personality-cult clich\u00e9s of the Romantic hero.  \nOne of Shelley\u2019s Ghost\u2019s great triumphs is its presentation of the manu-\nscripts, especially Percy Shelley\u2019s complex and at times near-illegible notebooks. \nSensitively lit and with adjacent transcriptions, it allows the viewer to appreciate \nthe texture of the documents, as well as the stages and procedures of their com-\nposition. These advantages are reproduced as far as possible in the book, which \ncontains a great many color photographs, and on the extensive interactive Web \nsite. In the Web site\u2019s introductory video, Hebron talks about Percy Shelley as a \n\u201ccraftsman,\u201d and the manuscripts certainly foreground the physical and mental \nefforts of writing, complete with revisions, sketches, and side-notes far removed \nfrom the deceptive purity of a printed page in a modern edition. The exhibition is \nthus immensely valuable for foregrounding the material culture of literary texts, \nin both their production and their collection and (non-)dissemination. Moreover, \nit leaves one with renewed admiration for the textual scholars who transcribed \nthe Shelleys\u2019 awesomely complex notebooks (see, for instance, The Bodleian Shel-\nley Manuscripts, 23 volumes, 1986\u20132001). Readers and viewers with a very deep \nknowledge of the Godwin-Shelley circle will gain from either the book or the ex-\nhibition little information that is not available elsewhere. But those interested in \nhow biographical and literary reputations are developed, fought over, and sustained \nwill find Shelley\u2019s Ghost extremely rich grounds for reflection.  \n"}
