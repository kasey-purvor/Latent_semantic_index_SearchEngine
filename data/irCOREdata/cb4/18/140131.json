In this situation managers can no longer rely on the channel resources that they have \nassembled to provide their extant competitive position.  Instead they must be able to combine \nresources in new ways, gain additional resources and dispose of superfluous resources, and to do \nthis repeatedly and rapidly if they are to compete successfully.  The term \u2018dynamic capabilities\u2019 has \nemerged in the strategic management literature for these activities. Using four case studies and the \nanalytic induction approach to data analysis, we identify seven dynamic capabilities for channel \ntransformation.  \n \nKeywords \nMarketing channels; business-to-business; dynamic capabilities; resource based view; case studies; \nanalytic induction  \n \nIntroduction \nPeter Drucker famously observed fifty years ago (Drucker 1954) that \u201cBecause it is its purpose to \ncreate a customer, any business enterprise has two, and only these two, basic functions: marketing \nand innovation.\u201d If he was right, our topic is an important one, as it concerns both marketing and \ninnovation. But while the product innovation that Drucker was referring to continues apace, today\u2019s \ncompetitive strategy is equally based on innovation in the route to market (Rayport 2005). The use \nof e-marketplaces (Dai and Kaufmann, 2002) and the evolution of the remote model to encompass \nproduct delivery and service as well as sales in sectors such as IT (Hoffman and Novak, 2000) are \njust two examples of innovative channel strategies as a key component of the value proposition. \nBut we have not seen the wholesale switch to remote channels which many predicted just a few \nyears ago. Instead, we find ourselves in a multi-channel world. The business-to-business sales force \nis still struggling to work out its relationship with the call centre and the Internet channel. And \nalthough the pure-play model flourishes for some product-market segments, many others like Dell \nhave found that a remote model of mail order, the telephone and the Internet still has to be \nsupplemented by a sales force to build relationships with major accounts.  \nThe route to market has therefore become a key competitive battleground in many industries, \nwith different players trying out different channels or channel combinations in an attempt to reduce \n 2\ncosts, improve customer satisfaction or both. A number of researchers have suggested that in such \ndynamic environments competitive advantage is transient, rather than sustainable (D\u2019Aveni 1994).  \nManagers must therefore concentrate on renewing rather than protecting their sources of \ncompetitive advantage (Rindova and Kotha 2001).  No longer can they rely on their extant channel \nresources \u2013 a distribution network, an excellent sales force - that they have assembled to provide \ntheir present competitive position.  The dynamic nature of channel competition requires them to be \nable to combine these resources in new ways and to gain additional resources, and to do this \nrepeatedly, if they are to compete successfully.  Strategic management scholars have come to refer \nto the processes by which firms reconfigure their resources in order to gain competitive advantage \nas dynamic capabilities (Treece et al 1997).   \nIn this paper we seek to help managers undertaking channel transformation by exploring the role \nof dynamic capabilities in this domain.  In particular this study, which is preliminary in nature, \nseeks to identify generic dynamic capabilities that might be considered as best practice in channel \ntransformation initiatives in B2B markets.  We also consider the lessons that the dynamic capability \nparadigm can provide to managers undertaking this important activity, and to academics engaged in \nstudying this domain. \nThe concept of dynamic capabilities has proved useful within some other marketing areas.  \nPrevious studies have considered their use in international expansion (Luo 2000; Griffith and \nHarvey 2001; Grant 1996) and new product development (Deeds et al 2000; King and Tucci 2002; \nSpanos and Prastacos 2004; Marsh and Stock, 2003).  Whilst other studies (Rindova and Kotha \n2001; Daniel and Wilson 2003; Hackbarth and Kettinger 2004; Wheeler 2002) have considered \nInternet channels specifically, we are unaware of the application of the concepts of dynamic \ncapabilities to the issues of how channels fit together and how channel strategy overall is to be \ndeveloped.  This study therefore represents an extension of this increasingly widely accepted area of \nstrategic thinking to this important topic. \nWe use the term channel transformation to describe an organisation\u2019s deployment of marketing \nand sales channels to significantly modify its strategy. In accordance with our focus on the \nresource-based view, we define strategy in turn as \u2018a sustained pattern of resource allocation\u2019 \n(Mintberg 1978). Following more recent practice (Payne and Frow 2004), we include within the \nterm \u2018channels\u2019 both indirect channels such as agents and distributors, and direct channels such as \nthe Internet, call centre and field sales force.  \nThe paper commences with a summary of the concept  of dynamic capabilities.  The objectives \nand method adopted for the study are then described and the findings of the study are then presented \n 3\nand discussed.  We conclude with a more general discussion of our findings including suggestions \nfor further research.  We do not here present a full review of the growing, though mainly \nprescriptive, literature addressing channel strategy in today\u2019s multi-channel environment. Instead \nthe reader is referred to papers by Payne and Frow (2004), Nunes and Cespedes (2003), Myers et al \n(2004) and Stone et al (2002), and to the other papers within this special section of Industrial \nMarketing Management. \n \nDynamic Capabilities \nThe resource based view (RBV) (Wernerfelt 1984) considers organisations as collections of specific \nphysical, human and organisational assets or resources.  If these assets are valuable, rare, inimitable \nand non-substitutable - the so-called VRIN attributes - they can be used to implement value-creating \nstrategies that will provide sustainable competitive advantage (Barney 1991).  Some scholars have \nquestioned whether RBV adequately explains why certain firms have competitive advantage in \nsituations of rapid and unpredictable market change, termed high-velocity or dynamic markets \n(Zollo and Winter 1999; Rindova and Kotha 2001).  In such markets, they argue, the mere existence \nof appropriate bundles of specific resources is not sufficient to sustain competitive advantage.  \nInstead a firm must constantly reconfigure, gain and dispose of resources to meet the demands of a \nshifting market.  This has led to the concept of dynamic capabilities, which are characterised as an \norganisation\u2019s processes that \u2018integrate, reconfigure, gain and release resources to match and even \ncreate market change\u2019 (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000: p.1107).  \nConsiderable interest has been shown in this concept, with studies focussing for example on their \nrole in organisational learning (Tsoukas and Mylonopoulos 2003); new firm formation (Newbert, \n2005); knowledge management (Sher and Lee, 2004; Macpherson et al 2004); corporate strategy \n(Bowman and Ambrosini 2003) and mergers and acquisitions (Roy and Roy, 2004). \nLawson and Samson (2001) apply a dynamic capabilities approach to the investigation of \ninnovation.  Whilst many authors highlight the differences between an organisation\u2019s well-\nestablished or \u2018mainstream\u2019 activities and their innovative or \u2018newstream\u2019 activities (Kanter 1989), \nLawson and Samson (p.382) stress that \u2018managing the different needs of the mainstream and \nnewstream independently is unlikely to be successful in a dynamic and turbulent operating \nenvironment\u2019.  They suggest that in such markets organisations must develop an innovation \ncapability that allows these two streams to be closely coupled.  They propose a model that \noperationalises this capability as seven elements: vision and strategy; harnessing the competence \nbase; organisational intelligence; creativity and idea management; organisational structure and \nsystems; culture and climate; and the management of technology. \n 4\nTeece et al (1997) suggest that dynamic capabilities are unique to individual firms, reflecting \ntheir individual idiosyncrasies and their specific path-dependencies.  Whilst acknowledging that the \ndetails of dynamic capabilities are idiosyncratic, Eisenhardt and Martin (2000) consider that \nspecific dynamic capabilities show considerable similarities across firms.   \nAlthough required in all markets, dynamic capabilities change in nature in high-velocity markets \nfrom their embodiment in more stable markets (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000).  In stable markets \nthey are detailed, analytic and stable processes and resemble the traditional conception of routines.  \nIn contrast, in high velocity markets dynamic capabilities become simple, experiential and fragile \nprocesses with unpredictable outcomes.  The simplicity of these capabilities means that there is \nlittle structure or routine for managers to rely on.  Prigogine and Stengers (1984) describe such \nprocesses as dissipative, in that they require constant energy to stay on track, and they are \nconstantly in the unstable state of slipping into either too much or too little structure.  As the rate of \nchange in the market increases, these processes become particularly difficult to sustain, leading to \nthe warning that in high-velocity markets, \u2018the threat to competitive advantage comes not only from \noutside the firm, but insidiously from inside the firm though the collapse of dynamic capabilities\u2019 \n(Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000 p.1113). \n \nMethod \nAn objective of this study is to identify generic or best practice dynamic capabilities which are \nnecessary for multi-channel transformation.  The resource based view (RBV) is usually linked to a \ncase study approach due to its ability to incorporate a rich picture of the firms studied, including \ntheir unique context and idiosyncrasies (Hoskisson 1999).  Since we are looking to identify \ncapabilities which are common across various B2B sectors, a multiple firm, cross-industry case \nstudy approach was adopted. \nThe analytic induction approach to data collection and analysis was used.  Originally proposed \nby Znaniecki (1934), analytic induction has refined into perhaps the best-developed logic for theory \ndevelopment and testing across multiple case studies (Gill and Johnson 1991). Recent applications \nin the marketing domain include Daniel et al (2003) and Wilson et al (2002).  In brief, the method \ninvolves generating hypotheses or propositions (here, our identification of dynamic capabilities \nrelevant to multi-channel transformation) from the first case study; using the hypotheses generated \nto inform the collection of data in the second case; comparing the hypothesis against the data \ncollected in the second case; if necessary reformulating or supplementing the hypotheses so as to \ntake account of the data from this case; and so on through the other cases.  \n 5\nTranslated into the context of this study, the method can be summarised as follows: \n1. Four cases were selected (listed in Table 1), to provide a spread across a range of B2B sectors \nincluding product and service firms, and across size of firm, private versus public sector and \nacross a range of different channel transformation initiatives.  Three of the cases were \ninternational organisations, one based in the US and two in the UK. The fourth company serves \npurely a UK market: we have renamed this company as Hospitality Services for reasons of \nconfidentiality. \nInsert Table 1 about here \n \n2. Semi-structured interviews were held with staff involved in channel strategy.  Nineteen \nmanagers from the four organisations were interviewed, of whom seven were at director level.  \nInterviews lasted between one and two hours and were tape-recorded and transcribed. \n3. Managers were asked to describe their organisation\u2019s current channel strategy, how it had \nevolved, and what the organisation had learned about what capabilities were necessary to \ntransform channel strategy.  \n4. Having completed the first case study, the transcripts were analysed and data supporting \nparticular examples of dynamic capabilities and of effective practice were identified.   \n5. A second case study was undertaken and the transcripts were analysed.  Data supporting the \ndynamic capabilities identified in the first case were noted.  Where necessary these capabilities \nwere amended to take account of the data from the second case, or additional capabilities were \nadded.   \n6. Step 5 was repeated for each subsequent case.  If a change was made to the capabilities \nidentified, or a new capability was added, it was ensured that the change was consistent with all \nprevious data, as well as the case under consideration. \nBoth the underlying markets in which the four organisations operate and the channel competition \nwhich they exhibit display different degrees of dynamism as shown in Table 1.  The increase in \nchannel competition had tended to contribute to the increased the level of dynamism or velocity in \nthree of the markets studied, providing the catalyst for significant industry change which had not yet \nstabilised. \n \nFindings and discussion \nTable 2 shows the seven specific dynamic capabilities that were identified in the case studies and \nhow frequently these were observed across the cases.  Four of these, which are listed first in Table \n2, appear to be associated with innovation and are consistent with the model of innovation \ncapability proposed by Lawson and Samson (2001).  A further three relate to integration between \n 6\nchannels (Payne and Frow 2004), though again they relate to elements of Lawson and Samson\u2019s \n(2001) model, as illustrated in the last column of Table 2.  Each capability will be discussed in turn. \nInsert Table 2 about here \n \nActive review of the route to market in an iterative strategy\/implementation cycle.  \nExploiting the competitive possibilities of channel strategy requires firstly that the organisation \nmust have some mechanism for reviewing and reforming the traditional route to market, rather than \njust taking it for granted. Many marketing planning methods, for example, start with a map of the \nindustry structure and a positioning of the organisation within that structure, and focus purely on \nrefining the product\/service offering  (McDonald 1999). Potential transformations to the industry \nstructure such as disintermediation or reintermediation, if considered at all, are regarded as \u2018out-of-\nthe-box thinking\u2019 that is high risk and essentially an intuitive bet. By contrast, in three of the cases, \nthese transformations were evaluated as a systematised part of the planning process. \nHospitality Services, for example, had traditionally sold almost exclusively via a 40-strong field \nsales force, with a mixture of field sales and internal call centre approaches for contract renewals. \nIts growth had slowed to single digits over the past two years, despite plenty of market potential, \nand the sales and marketing director believed that the problem was that the sales force simply \ncouldn\u2019t cover the whole territory. Neither could he increase its size due to pressure on annual \nprofitability. The idea of transforming the route to market came from two sources. Firstly, he had \nbeen exposed via a business school to ideas and case studies on multi-channel marketing, and he \nbegun to conceive of alternative channel models from observation of successes in other sectors. \nAdditionally, a colleague responsible for debt collection had experimented successfully with an \noutsourced call centre for smaller accounts, which introduced the idea of using the call centre in the \nsales context. \nThe sales and marketing director therefore instituted a planning process to review the route to \nmarket. This conceived a new model using a call centre for lower-value accounts, desk-based \naccount managers for medium-value accounts and field sales staff with desk-based support for key \naccounts. A series of pilots was undertaken to test and refine the model. The first covered a single \ngeographical area, chosen to be broadly typical of the organisation\u2019s market. This found that the \ncost of sale was significantly lower using the call centre approach for most customers, but the \npicture was uneven.  \n 7\nFor customer groups where the new approach was manifestly working, he rolled out the new \nmodel across the UK. For others, further experiments occurred in a second geographical pilot to \nfine-tune the model. \nBy the time of the interviews, the sales and marketing director had concluded that there would \nnever be a \u2018final\u2019 version of the route-to-market model: \n\u201cI thought that after three months of piloting we would nail down the new approach and that would be that. I\u2019m \nbeginning to live with uncertainty now. As long as we can produce some reasonable estimates for the year for \nthe budget, it\u2019s OK that we just keep on refining. Though the broad template we defined in our original planning \nsessions is holding firm.\u201d \nThe partial exception to this pattern of iterative strategy and implementation was UK Trade And \nInvestment, where the review of route to market, while planned and systematic, was a one-off \nactivity (which we will describe later): it remains to be seen whether this company will institute \nregular further reviews. It is notable that this company faces the lowest environmental turbulence of \nthe four cases, as we saw in Table 1.  \n \nThe alignment of route to market with different segment\/product characteristics. \nTypically, market segmentation impacts on marketing communications and perhaps the product and \npricing, but often it has no impact on the route to market. In each of the cases, though, different \ncustomer groups were served through different channel combinations, defined to take into account \nboth the relative value of different segments and their different needs.  \nIBM, BT and Hospitality Services all represented this variation through a \u2018coverage map\u2019 \n(Friedman and Furey 1999), which lists customer groups along the vertical axis of a chart, with \nhighest value customers at the top, and product groups along the horizontal axis in increasing order \nof product sales complexity.  Figure 1 shows a coverage map for IBM.   This map was a key tool in \nrationalising their routes to market.  Seven main routes worldwide, each of which was represented \nby a different colour on the chart, were identified.  These include the IBM Global Services channel \nfor major outsourcing projects (route 1 on the chart), the direct sales force for large system \nimplementations (route 5), and a range of distributor types (2, 3, 4 and 6), as well as a direct \ntelephone\/web operation (route 7). This \u201cRoute-to-market Simplification Strategy\u201d project, as it was \ntermed, made modest changes to the \u2018closing channel\u2019 where sales are closed, with face-to-face \nsales slightly reduced, but quite substantial changes on lead generation, where 22% fewer leads \nwere generated from field sales over a one-year period as other channels took up the slack. This \nallowed greater time investment by account managers to the crucial areas of post-sales delivery and \nsupport. \n 8\nInsert Figure 1 about here \nA further benefit of this standardised focus on seven routes to market for the entire global \norganisation was that the cost of managing channels was reduced, as staff internally and externally \nhad a clearer idea of their role. A country marketing director estimated that his channel management \ncosts had reduced by 50%. \n \nThe creation of innovative channel combinations. \nThe experience of the four cases we studied suggested that emphasis has moved away from \u2018pure-\nplay\u2019 new channels to innovative channel combinations. In none were new channels straightforward \nsubstitutes for existing ones: rather, the transformed strategy involved innovative combinations of \nchannels targeted at particular customer groups. At the very least, the possibility of combining \nchannels within the same customer relationship, as opposed to simply having a range of channels \nfor different customers, provides another strategic option which needs to be considered.  \nUK Trade And Investment is a case in point. The purpose of this public sector organisation is to \nimprove the export performance of UK small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It had traditionally \nfulfilled this mission through a network of 200 consultants, situated in offices country-wide, who \nwould advise clients face to face. This, then, represented a one-size-fits-all channel strategy. The \norganisation launched a project to segment its customer base and define propositions appropriate to \neach segment. This would include a review of its channel strategy as well as other elements of the \nmix. \nThe review began with a market research exercise, which simplifying somewhat, resulted in \nthree major segments. \u2018Aspirants\u2019 export little or not at all as yet, but aspire to doing so in the \nfuture. \u2018Reluctants\u2019 are also inexperienced exporters, but by contrast are fearful of the complexities \nand risks they associate with exporting, creating deep-seated barriers to progressing beyond the \nfulfilment of the few leads which happen to \u2018walk in the door\u2019. \u2018Confidents\u2019 export as a matter of \ncourse, and are only likely to turn to UK Trade And Investment for help on specifics such as \nidentifying a distributor in a new country. \nAs part of the subsequent proposition development, channel combinations were developed for \neach of these broad segments by a team of managers. These can be represented using what we term \na channel chain diagram, as shown in Figure 2. In this diagram, the stages of the sales and\/or \nservice process are listed down the left, starting at the top of the figure. The channels used to \nperform each stage are listed in boxes against each stage. If there is then a handover to a different \n 9\nchannel for the next stage of the customer relationship, this is shown with a line between the two \nboxes. \nInsert Figure 2 about here \n \nThe \u2018aspirants\u2019, for example, were reasonably well served by the organisation\u2019s traditional \nchannel strategy of face-to-face consultations with advisers who guide the entrepreneur through an \nexport planning process, so this segment\u2019s overall proposition which the team termed \u201cPassport to \nexport\u201d involved only minor modifications to channel strategy. The last thing the \u2018confidents\u2019 \nwanted, though, was to phone a local office and have an appointment made two weeks\u2019 hence when \na consultant happened to be free. Instead, a \u2018buffet\u2019 approach was designed for them, dominated by \nthe remote channels of a call centre with expert ringback plus the Internet, which would provide \nquick access to the answers they needed to their specific queries. \nThe pure face-to-face model was equally inappropriate for the \u2018reluctants\u2019, who tended to only \napproach UK Trade And Investment for help with fulfilling a specific order that happened to come \ntheir way, such as \u201chow to get money out of Saudi Arabia\u201d or \u201cthe customs paperwork for China\u201d. \nThe management team concluded that the same remote \u2018buffet\u2019 designed for the experienced \nexporters met this specific need, but needed to be supplemented by a cost-effective communications \ncampaign to address the segment\u2019s attitudinal barriers, using such techniques as seminars and white \npapers. The aim here was to convert some members of this segment to become \u2018aspirants\u2019. \nHospitality Services, IBM and BT had also sought to design combinations of channels. IBM paid \nparticular attention to how the handover was made between channels at different points in the \nrelationship with the customer. The colours on their coverage map represented the \u2018leading\u2019 or \n\u2018closing\u2019 channel, therefore, and not the exclusive channel for that customer\/product cell.   IBM \nbelieved that effective design of channel combinations should provide a natural journey for the \ncustomer, and also benefits to the organisation: \n \u201cI don\u2019t think we can force customers to stay within a particular channel combination we have designed for \nthem. But having gone through this thought process, the idea is that customers will gently steer themselves  \nthrough a channel combination which suits them. And it suits us as it makes appropriate use of low-cost \nchannels, where the customer doesn\u2019t need high bandwidth.\u201d Lead partner, IBM \nIterative development of the value proposition melding planning and experience.  \nAny new service will require a redefinition of the customer value proposition. However, the \nmanagers interviewed described the highly challenging nature of this in the multi-channel world.  In \nsome markets use of online channels is still the exception rather than the rule, for example, and \n 10\ncustomer experience is not yet sufficient for them to be able to articulate what value offering would \nbe optimal, although when they find a service disappointing they will abandon it very quickly \n(Reichheld and Schefter 2000; Agrawal et al 2001).  Companies must therefore develop the \ncapability of creating new services that customers will value without the market research that they \nmight traditionally rely on.  How can they do this without resorting to guesswork? A key seems to \nbe a more experiential approach (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi 1995) which involves hypothesising a \nvalue proposition and then trialing it in the marketplace and using feedback from customer \ninteractions to validate and tune the proposition.   \nBT used an experimental design incorporating control cells in order to learn from its early \nexperimentation in its route to market within its major business division, which served the top one \nthousand accounts. Until 2001, the division sold almost exclusively through two thousand field \nsales representatives. A channel strategy exercise proposed a new model: a combination of field \nsales staff for more complex sales to high-value customers, the web for simple transactions to low-\nvalue customers, and a new desk-based account manager (DBAM) channel \u2013professional account \nmanagers, but working exclusively from the office - in the middle. Its new coverage map was thus \nvery similar to that of Hospitality Services, and is illustrated in Figure 3. \nBT decided that the first step to test the efficacy of this new model was to conduct a pilot: \n\u201cGiven the nature of the change, the risks of it going wrong and the impact upon our reputation with BT\u2019s \nlargest clients, we needed to progress carefully, piloting every step, learning, rolling out, and enhancing every \npart of the effort\u201d Channel director, BT \nThe pilot involved allocating 12 DBAMs to a pilot set of accounts, who had their field sales \nrepresentation reduced accordingly. Importantly, they were working in an integrated team with field \nsales staff, because as the coverage map makes clear, a single customer may deal with two or three \ndifferent channels depending on the sales complexity of the product. The team could communicate \nwith each other about customer interactions via a simple shared prototype IT system, in order to \ndeliver an integrated customer experience: the subsequent full rollout used the Siebel CRM system \nfor this purpose, but the technology was kept simple and flexible for the pilot.  \nSome business rules were drafted for the pilot that allocated sales leads to channels based on the \ncoverage map. Significantly, though, the staff in each channel were authorised to overrule this \nautomated allocation of leads if they felt that individual circumstances required a different \napproach. In the pilot, around 60% of the automated channel recommendations were accepted: in \nthe subsequent rollout, this figure has increased to 80% as the business rules have been refined. \n 11\nAfter a trial period, the pilot was evaluated on three criteria: cost of marketing and sales as a \nproportion of revenue, or \u2018expense to revenue ratio\u2019; customer satisfaction; and employee \nsatisfaction. The pilot found the cost of sale had decreased from 25% of revenue to 17% due \nprimarily to the lower cost of employing desk-based account managers. Customer satisfaction \nactually went up: the project manager\u2019s interpretation of this was that customers were able to access \nDBAMs more quickly than field sales staff and therefore were able to deal with simple matters \nmore effectively. Employee satisfaction remained constant \u2013 itself regarded as an achievement in a \nsituation which was inclined to be threatening to the field sales staff. \nThe pilot was regarded as a success, and a rollout of the new channel model followed over the \nfollowing three years, to a point where a fifth of the field sales force had been replaced by desk-\nbased account managers. As well as decreasing the cost of sale, the interviewees claimed that over \n\u00a3100m of additional annual revenue had been gained by 2004 due to the channel transformation, as \nthe field sales force was freed up from simple tasks and able to focus on significant opportunities. \nSimilarly, Hospitality Services intended to use random experimental and control group allocation \nto confirm the findings from their geographically-based pilots: \n\u201cWe\u2019ll divide the next thousand sales leads in the [x] sector into two groups. The first lead to the sales force, the \nsecond to the call centre the third to the sales force and so on. We won\u2019t tell either party of course. Now that will \nbe interesting!\u201d Interviewee, Hospitality Services \n \nIntegration of processes and IT to support multi-channel customer relationships.  \nBy contrast, the last three capabilities listed in Table 2 are associated with integrating channels \ntogether. Perhaps counter-intuitively, systems integration does not seem in tension with the need for \nswift innovation: rather, it provides a platform on which the company can experiment with different \nchannel combinations performing different roles in the customer relationship, and communicating \nwith each other via the shared IT systems. \nBT, as we have mentioned, implemented a CRM system as a crucial underpinning of its \ntransformation from field sales force to multi-channel marketer. Once its Siebel system had been \nrolled out to all sales and service staff, the channel director soon extended the rollout to the indirect \nchannel partners so they could draw on the same unified data on leads and existing customers. This \nenabled BT to analyse and improve the effectiveness of the distributor channel under the same \nmetrics as the internal channels. \nHospitality Services similarly soon concluded that its call centre partner needed access to its core \ncustomer management system. Initially, the call centre used its own system, and transferred a batch \n 12\nof data to Hospitality Services periodically through a campaign, but once the economics of the early \nwork had been proved, it was soon felt necessary to give call centre staff direct access to the \ncustomer management system so they could deliver an integrated customer experience and come \nacross as fully informed on the customer\u2019s previous interactions with the company. \n \nAn organisational structure which balances the need for innovation and integration  \nAnother dimension of integration concerns organisational structure. The advantages of a separate \nunit for new channels in freeing up the embedded cultural artefacts which provide a brake on \ninnovation have been much discussed in the e-commerce context (Chaffey 2002). But BT amongst \nothers reported that this can lead to \u2018channel silos\u2019 in which staff act in the best interests of their \nchannel rather than the overall customer relationship: \n\u201cHow would we get field-based sales to embrace a second, lower cost, channel to market? How could we \nchange embedded habits and routines? If we freed up senior sales peoples\u2019 time for strategic work \u2013 would they \nrise to the challenge? Would we end up with a series of mini BT businesses or could we really integrate all the \nchannels into a single, managed customer experience?\u201d \nBT\u2019s answer, as shown in Figure 4, was a matrix structure, in which staff in the new direct channels \n\u2013 desk-based account managers and BT.com \u2013 report \u2018sideways\u2019 to the channel director but also \n\u2018vertically\u2019 to the account team for whom they are working. The sideways reporting appears to help  \nto consolidate learning in best practice within each channel, while the vertical reporting keeps the \naccount director responsible for all the channel resources deployed on the account. \nInsert Figure 4 about here \n \nMetrics and rewards which reflect multi-channel customer behaviour.  \nSimilar cross-channel thinking seems necessary in the definition of metrics and rewards. For \nexample, a corollary of IBM\u2019s coverage map, which dictates that the customer may use different \nchannels for different products, is that it does not make sense to remunerate field sales for every \nproduct sale. Simpler products were therefore taken out of their renumeration package as a key \ndriver of changed behaviour. In other cases, the complementary roles of different channels at \ndifferent points of the customer relationship were reflected in the recognition of the value of leads \nwhich are passed for fulfilment to a different channel. \nBT had a slightly different approach. In recognition of the need for simpler products to have a \nlow cost of sale, its CRM system automatically routes these leads to a lower cost channel such as a \ndesk-based account manager, as we have already mentioned. The alignment with rewards comes, \nthough, with the account manager\u2019s targets, which include a stretching target for expense-to-\n 13\nrevenue ratio, which can only be met by diverting at least some business to lower-cost channels. \nThe same effect, then, is achieved as with IBM, but by a subtly different method. \nHospitality Services resolved the issue by a yet simpler approach. To encourage cross-channel \ncooperation, the organisation switched from bonuses based on individual or group performance to a \nsingle bonus system for the organisation based on the whole organisation\u2019s cash flow for the year. It \nis difficult to isolate the impact of this initiative from the other simultaneous management changes, \nbut the company\u2019s perception that this resulted in no loss of motivation or staff retention while \nremoving some dysfunctional channel silo behaviour seems plausible and consistent with the \ncompany\u2019s employee satisfaction survey data. \n \n \nConclusions \nDue to the paucity of previous studies in this domain, our study adopted an inductive approach, \nidentifying seven dynamic capabilities for channel transformation.  Of these, we categorised four as \ninnovation-related, but importantly we also found that three integrative capabilities are critical to \nroute-to-market transformation, relating to IT, organisational structure and metrics\/rewards. \nOrganisations must not only be able to find how to make use of new channels, but also bring those \nchannels into their standard way of operating, if the organisation is going to deliver an integrated \ncustomer experience and make the most of synergies between channels.  In this respect, our study \nsupports the argument made by Lawson and Samson (2001) for managing the \u2018mainstream\u2019 and the \n\u2018newstream\u2019 in a closely coupled way, while adding detail as to how this can be achieved in the \ncase of marketing channels.   \nAn important finding of the study therefore is that channel strategy presents organisations with a \ntension between two distinct groups of dynamic capabilities that must be balanced.  On the one \nhand, managers need to develop innovative channels that change the way the company operates and \nhow it interacts with its customers, while on the other, they need to keep the organisation operating \nas a single, coherent entity so as to create innovative channel combinations and deliver consistent \nservice.   \nDynamic capability theory provides at least a hint of how this tension might be managed.  In \nhigh-velocity markets, Eisenhardt and Martin (2000) assert, dynamic capabilities become simple, \nexperiential and iterative. This was found to be the case in three of the companies studied here, \nwhere channel strategy was evolved by setting an overall, clear and simple vision for the intended \ntransformation.  This was then broken down into a series of smaller projects, to which the \ncompanies applied a \u2018learning by doing\u2019 (Pisano 1994) approach, and not just a \u2018learning before \n 14\ndoing\u2019 one.  Subsequent stages of development, rather than follow a pre-determined linear \nsequence, would iteratively depend upon the outcomes and learning produced from earlier projects. \nIt is consistent with Eisenhardt and Martin\u2019s assertion that the exception, UK Trade And \nInvestment, which developed and executed its channel strategy in a more planned manner, operates \nin a market with comparatively low turbulence. \nImplications for Managers \nThe implications for managers can be summarised under the headings of the seven dynamic \ncapabilities of table 2. \n1. Companies can gain from actively and regularly reviewing the route to market, rather than \ntaking it for granted as \u2018the way things are done in our industry\u2019. Innovation in the channel \nmix can be a source of competitive advantage as valuable as innovation in the \nproduct\/service offer. The frequency with which review this is necessary depends on how \nturbulent the market is. \n2. This review needs to bear in mind that the optimum route to market will generally vary \nboth by segment and by product. The coverage map (Friedman and Furey 1999) is a tool \nwhich managers can consider to help with this task. \n3. Combining multiple channels within the same relationship provides further innovation \npossibilities. During the dot-com boom we saw many new pure-play entrants into B2B \nmarkets, amongst them such now-defunct e-marketplaces as Covisint and Chemdex as well \nas a smaller number of successes. Perhaps many of the \u2018quick wins\u2019 from pure-play \nInternet sales, or indeed from single-channel telephone operations, have already been \ngained, however, as channel innovation shifts away from new channels to new channel \ncombinations. We have described a simple tool we term channel chain diagrams, which \nspell out how channels combine in the customer relationship. However it is drawn, though, \nit appears that channel chain analysis can act as a shared representation within a \nmanagement team while it discusses the optimum channel proposition relative firstly to \ncustomers\u2019 differing needs at different points in the relationship, and secondly to the use of \nexpensive physical and human assets in a more targeted manner. \n4. A planned approach to multi-channel strategy may need to be combined with \nexperimentation and piloting to refine the plan. An experimental design using control \ngroups is worth considering when a radical shift in channel policy is being contemplated. \n 15\n5. Customer relationships sustained across multiple channels will generally need to be \nunderpinned by a CRM system. This may need to be made available to indirect channel \npartners as well as direct channel staff. \n6. An organisational structure that is strongly built around channel silos may have weaknesses \nif the customer relationship is sustained across multiple channels. A matrix structure or a \nstructure around customer groups may be worth considering. \n7. Similarly, metrics and rewards can be in tension with a multi-channel strategy if they \nencourage staff or channel partners to keep the customer within a single channel.  \nLimitations and Further Research \nThere are always limits to the generalizability of case study research, as it is difficult to rule out \nthe possibility that the sample organisations are in some way unusual, particularly with a relatively \nsmall number of cases. We would therefore welcome further studies to confirm and extend our \nfindings.  Further studies could check for any additional dynamic capabilities important in channel \ntransformation as well as checking and refining those we have identified.  In particular, our \ninductive study identified five of the seven innovation elements cited by Lawson and Samson \n(2001).  Further studies, particularly of players in other markets, may identify capabilities related to \nthe other elements that they propose.  \nThe differences we have discussed in how companies plan their route to market according to \nmarket turbulence would also benefit from further research. It would therefore be helpful if future \ncase study research were to include a spread of organisations with different levels of market \nturbulence in its sample frame.  \nA survey approach to this topic will become increasingly feasible as case study work continues \nand the relevant constructs are identified, and could provide a more complete descriptive picture of \ncurrent practice. Testing of hypotheses based on our proposed dynamic capabilities would, \nhowever, face the not inconsiderable challenge of constructing a dependent variable for the success \nof a multi-channel strategy. We suspect that case study research is likely to be more illuminating in \nthe short term. \nAs underlying markets become increasingly dynamic, an improved understanding of the role of \ndynamic capabilities will become imperative, both for academics who wish to provide \nunderstanding and guidance to practitioners, and for managers who must operate in a continually \nshifting world.  We hope this study adds a small step along the path to this improved understanding. \n 16\nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank Cranfield\u2019s Dr Stan Maklan for his work on the BT case study, Dr Brian \nSmith and Lindsay Bruce for their work with UK Trade And Investment, and Alex Garrett for his \nassistance with the IBM case study.
