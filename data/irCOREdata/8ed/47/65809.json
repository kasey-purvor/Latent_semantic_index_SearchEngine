This is a generic feature of the ISS models of metastable\nsupersymmetry breaking due to the fact that SUSY preserving vacua contain fewer light degrees of\nfreedom than the metastable ground state at the origin. These models of metastable SUSY breaking\nare thus placed on an equal footing with the more usual dynamical SUSY breaking scenarios.\n1. Introduction\nIt has recently been noted that dynamical supersymmetry breaking in a long-lived metastable vacuum\nis an interesting alternative to the usual dynamical supersymmetry breaking scenario [1]1. It was shown\nthat a microscopic asymptotically free theory can, for certain choices of parameters, be described by\na Seiberg dual theory in the infra-red which has a metastable minimum at the origin. Moreover, the\nglobal supersymmetric minima are also located where the macroscopic theory is well under control,\nand it could be shown that the tunnelling rate to the true global minima could be made parametrically\nsmall. This class of theories has recently attracted a lot of interest [3\u201314]. It opens up new avenues\nfor SUSY phenomenology, but one open question is that of naturalness; can one explain the fact that\nthe Universe today resides in a metastable minimum? Are these models more, or less, natural than\nthe usual scenario of dynamical supersymmetry breaking?\nIn this paper we point out that ending up in such a metastable minimum is in fact very natural and\neven generic in the context of a thermal Universe. The theory at the metastable minimum has (quite\ngenerally) more massless and nearly massless degrees of freedom than at the supersymmetric minimum,\nan unusual consequence of the fact that the SUSY preserving vacua appear non-perturbatively2 in the\nIntriligator-Seiberg-Shih (ISS) model. We will show that due to these relatively light states, at high\ntemperatures (greater than the supersymmetry breaking scale), the metastable minimum at the origin\nbecomes the global minimum. Moreover, we will see that even if the fields begin in the supersymmetric\nminimum, high enough temperatures will thermally drive them to the SUSY breaking minimum where\nthey remain trapped as the Universe cools. More precisely, we consider a scenario where, at the end\nof inflation, the Universe is very cold and we may assume that it is in the energetically preferred\nsupersymmetric vacuum. Then the Universe reheats. If the temperature is high enough it will then\nautomatically evolve towards the SUSY breaking state as we will show in the following. Thus these\nmodels offer an alternative and appealing explanation for why supersymmetry is broken: the early\nUniverse was driven to a supersymmetry breaking, metastable minimum by thermal effects.3\nIn general we think of the settings where the ISS model forms a sector of the full theory which\nincludes a supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Supersymmetry of the full theory is broken if\nthe ISS sector ends up in the metastable non-supersymmetric vacuum. For the full theory to be driven\nto this SUSY breaking vacuum by thermal effects we, of course, have to assume that the relevant fields\nof the supersymmetry breaking sector (ISS), of the MSSM sector, and of the messenger sector were at\nsome time in thermal equilibrium. This is the case if the SUSY breaking scenario is gauge mediation,\ndirect mediation, or even a visible sector breaking. (On the other hand, a SUSY breaking sector which\ncouples to the MSSM only gravitationally would remain out of thermal equilibrium.)\n1In a simple modified O\u2019Raifeartaigh model the possibility of SUSY breaking in a metastable vacuum has been\nconsidered already a while ago in [2]. It is interesting to note that one of the motivations for this work was that the\nUniverse may get stuck in such a metastable state.\n2In other words, supersymmetry is restored dynamically.\n3If the initial conditions are such that the Universe starts in the supersymmetry breaking state (the case considered\nin Refs. [15,16] subsequent to this paper), it will stay there (cf. also [1,17]).\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nThe fact that the Universe can be driven to a metastable minimum by thermal effects is well\nknown in the context of charge and colour breaking minima in the MSSM [18, 19]. However these\nmodels differ from our case in two respects. First, it is in the global minimum away from the origin\nthat a symmetry, namely supersymmetry, is being restored in our scenario. In addition the effective\npotential is extremely flat because the SUSY preserving true vacua are generated dynamically. It is\ntherefore automatically very sensitive to finite temperature effects, whilst having a metastable vacuum\nthat is extremely long lived.\nIn this paper it will be sufficient to consider the ISS metastable SUSY breaking sector on its own.\nThe thermal transition to the non-supersymmetric vacuum will be driven by the above mismatch\nbetween the numbers of light degrees of freedom in the two vacua of the ISS model.\n2. The ISS model at zero temperature\n2.1 Set-up of the model\nThe Intriligator-Seiberg-Shih model [1] is described by a supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory coupled\ntoNf flavours of chiral superfields \u03d5\nc\ni and \u03d5\u02dc\ni\nc transforming in the fundamental and the anti-fundamental\nrepresentations of the gauge group; c = 1, . . . , N and i = 1, . . . , Nf . There is also an Nf \u00d7Nf chiral\nsuperfield \u03a6ij which is a gauge singlet. The number of flavours is taken to be large, Nf > 3N, such\nthat the \u03b2-function for the gauge coupling is positive,\nb0 = 3N \u2212Nf < 0 (2.1)\nthe theory is free in the IR and strongly coupled in the UV where it develops a Landau pole at the\nenergy-scale \u039bL. The Wilsonian gauge coupling is\ne\u22128pi\n2\/g2(E) =\n(\nE\n\u039bL\n)Nf\u22123N\n(2.2)\nThe condition (2.1) ensures that the theory is weakly coupled at scales E \u226a \u039bL, thus its low-energy\ndynamics as well as the vacuum structure is under control. In particular, this guarantees a robust\nunderstanding of the theory in the metastable SUSY breaking vacuum found in [1]. This is one of the\nkey features of the ISS model(s).\nOne notes that this formulation of the theory can only provide a low-energy effective field theory\ndescription due to the lack of the asymptotic freedom in (2.1),(2.2). At energy scales of order \u039bL\nand above, this effective description breaks down and one should use instead a different (microscopic)\ndescription of the theory, assuming it exists. Fortunately \u2013 and this is the second key feature of the\nISS construction [1] \u2013 the ultraviolet completion of this effective theory is known and is provided by\nits Seiberg dual formulation [20\u201322]. The microscopic description of the ISS model is N = 1 super-\nsymmetric QCD with the gauge group SU(Nc) and Nf flavours of fundamental and anti-fundamental\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nquarks Qi and Q\u02dc\ni. The number of colours in the microscopic theory is Nc = Nf\u2212N and the number of\nflavours Nf is the same in both descriptions. It is required to be in the range Nc+1 \u2264 Nf < 32Nc. The\nlower limit on Nf ensures that Eq. (2.1) holds, while the b\nmicro\n0 coefficient of the microscopic theory is\npositive (the \u03b2-function is negative and the microscopic theory is asymptotically free)\nbmicro0 = 3Nc \u2212Nf ,\n3\n2\nNc < b\nmicro\n0 \u2264 2Nc \u2212 1 (2.3)\nThis microscopic formulation of the ISS model will be referred to as the SU(Nc), Nf microscopic\nSeiberg dual. It is weakly coupled in the UV and strongly coupled in the IR. However, we already\nmentioned that the vacuum structure of the theory and the supersymmetry breaking by a metastable\nvacuum should be considered in the low-energy effective description of the theory, which is IR free.\nThis description of the ISS model is known as the SU(N), Nf macroscopic Seiberg dual formulation.\nFrom now on we will always assume this macroscopic dual description of the ISS model. For the\npurposes of this paper, the microscopic dual description is only necessary to guarantee the existence\nof the theory above the Landau pole \u039bL.\nThe tree-level superpotential of the ISS model is given by\nWcl = hTrNf\u03d5\u03a6\u03d5\u02dc \u2212 h\u00b52 TrNf\u03a6 (2.4)\nwhere h and \u00b5 are constants. The usual holomorphicity arguments imply that the superpotential (2.4)\nreceives no corrections in perturbation theory. However, there is a non-perturbative contribution to\nthe full superpotential of the theory, W = Wcl +Wdyn, which is generated dynamically. Wdyn was\ndetermined in [1] and is given by\nWdyn = N\n(\nhNf\ndetNf\u03a6\n\u039b\nNf\u22123N\nL\n) 1\nN\n(2.5)\nThis dynamical superpotential is exact, its form is uniquely determined by the symmetries of the\ntheory and it is generated by instanton-like configurations.\nThe authors of [1] have studied the vacuum structure of the theory and established the existence\nof the metastable vacuum |vac\u3009+ characterised by\n\u3008\u03d5\u3009 = \u3008\u03d5\u02dcT \u3009 = \u00b5\n(\n1lN\n0Nf\u2212N\n)\n, \u3008\u03a6\u3009 = 0 , V+ = (Nf \u2212N)|h2\u00b54| (2.6)\nwhere V+ is the classical energy density in this vacuum. Supersymmetry is broken since V+ > 0. In\nthis vacuum the SU(N) gauge group is Higgsed by the vevs of \u03d5 and \u03d5\u02dc and the gauge degrees of\nfreedom are massive with mgauge = g\u00b5.\nThis supersymmetry breaking vacuum |vac\u3009+ originates from the so-called rank condition, which\nimplies that there are no solutions to the F-flatness equation F\n\u03a6ji\n= 0 for the classical superpotential\nWcl in (2.4),\nF\n\u03a6ji\n= h(\u03d5\u02dcjc\u03d5\nc\ni \u2212 \u00b52\u03b4Ji ) 6= 0 (2.7)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nThe non-perturbative superpotential of (2.5) gives negligible contributions to the effective potential\naround this vacuum and can be ignored there. It was further argued in [1] that the vacuum (2.6) has\nno tachyonic directions, is classically stable, and quantum-mechanically is long-lived.\nIn addition to the metastable SUSY breaking vacuum |vac\u3009+, the authors of [1] have also identified\nthe SUSY preserving stable vacuum4 |vac\u30090,\n\u3008\u03d5\u3009 = \u3008\u03d5\u02dcT \u3009 = 0 , \u3008\u03a6\u3009 = \u03a60 = \u00b5\u03b30 1lNf , V0 = 0 (2.8)\nwhere V0 is the energy density in this vacuum and\n\u03b30 =\n(\nh\u01eb\nNf\u22123N\nNf\u2212N\n)\u22121\n, and \u01eb :=\n\u00b5\n\u039bL\n\u226a 1 (2.9)\nThis vacuum was determined in [1] by solving the F-flatness conditions for the complete superpotential\nW = Wcl +Wdyn of the theory. In the vicinity of |vac\u30090 the non-perturbative superpotential of (2.5)\nis essential as it alleviates the rank condition (2.7) and allows to solve F\n\u03a6ji\n= 0 equations. Thus,\nthe appearance of the SUSY preserving vacuum (2.8) can be interpreted in our macroscopic dual\ndescription as a non-perturbative or dynamical restoration of supersymmetry [1].\nWhen in the next Section we put the ISS theory at high temperature it will be important to know\nthe number of light and heavy degrees of freedom of the theory as we interpolate between |vac\u3009+ and\n|vac\u30090. The macroscopic description of the ISS model is meaningful as long as we work at energy\nscales much smaller than the cut-off scale \u039bL. The requirement that \u01eb = \u00b5\/\u039bL \u226a 1 is a condition\nthat the gauge theory is weakly coupled at the scale \u00b5 which is the natural scale of the macroscopic\ntheory. Equation (2.9) implies that \u03b30 \u226b 1 or in other words that there is a natural separation of\nscales \u00b5\u226a \u03a60 = \u00b5\u03b30 \u226a \u039bL dictated by \u01eb\u226a 1. The masses of order h\u03a60 will be treated as heavy and\nall other masses suppressed with respect to h\u03a60 by a positive power of \u01eb we will refer to as light. In\nthe SUSY preserving vacuum |vac\u30090 the heavy degrees of freedom are the Nf flavours of \u03d5 and \u03d5\u02dc, they\nget the tree-level masses m\u03d5 = h\u03a60 via (2.4). All other degrees of freedom in |vac\u30090 are light.5\nIn the vacuum |vac\u3009+ all of the original degrees of freedom of the ISS theory are light. Hence we\nnote for future reference that the SUSY preserving vacuum |vac\u30090 has fewer light degrees of freedom\nthan the SUSY breaking vacuum |vac\u3009+. The mismatch is given by the Nf flavours of \u03d5 and \u03d5\u02dc. The\nfact that the metastable SUSY breaking vacuum has fewer degrees of freedom than the supersymmetric\nvacuum is an important feature of the ISS model. As we will explain below, this property will give us\na necessary condition for the thermal Universe to end up in the metastable vacuum in the first place.\n4In fact there are precisely Nf \u2212N = Nc of such vacua differing by the phase e\n2pii\/(Nf\u2212N) as required by the Witten\nindex of the microscopic Seiberg dual formulation.\n5Gauge degrees of freedom in |vac\u30090 are confined, but the appropriate mass gap, given by the gaugino condensate,\nis parametrically (in \u01eb) smaller than m\u03d5 = h\u03a60. Thus the gauge degrees of freedom can still be counted as light for\nsufficiently high temperatures.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\n2.2 Effective potential\nHaving presented the general set-up, let us now turn to the effective potential between the two vacua\n|vac\u3009+ and |vac\u30090 of the ISS model. This can be determined in its entirety as follows. We parameterise\nthe path interpolating between the two vacua (2.6) and (2.8) in field space via\n\u03d5(\u03c3) = \u03d5\u02dcT (\u03c3) = \u03c3\u00b5\n(\n1lN\n0Nf\u2212N\n)\n, \u03a6(\u03b3) = \u03b3\u00b51lNf , 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b30 , 1 \u2265 \u03c3 \u2265 0 (2.10)\nSince the Ka\u00a8hler potential in the free magnetic phase in the IR is that of the classical theory, the\neffective potential V can be determined from knowing the superpotential of the theory (2.4), (2.5).\nFirst we will calculate the classical potential Vcl along path (2.10) and ignoring the non-perturbative\ncontribution Wdyn. Using (2.4) we find,\n1\n|h|2Vcl(\u03b3, \u03c3) = TrNf |\u03a6\u03d5|\n2 +TrNf |\u03d5\u02dc\u03a6|2+TrNf |\u03d5\u02dci\u03d5j \u2212 \u00b52\u03b4ij |2 = |\u00b5|4(2N\u03b32\u03c32 +N(\u03c32 \u2212 1)2 +Nf \u2212N)\n(2.11)\nThis expression for Vcl(\u03b3, \u03c3) is extremized for \u03c3 =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 or \u03c3 = 0. We substitute the first solution\nfor \u03c3 into Vcl for the range of 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 1, and the second solution, \u03c3 = 0 for 1 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b30. We thus\nobtain\n1\n|h2\u00b54| Vcl(\u03b3) =\n{\nNf \u2212N + 2N\u03b32(1\u2212 12\u03b32) 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 1\nNf 1 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b30\n(2.12)\nThis potential is accurate for \u03b3 \u2264 1, where the potential is rising. In order to address the flat regime\n1 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b30 we need to include the contribution of the non-perturbative Wdyn.

The SUSY breaking metastable minimum |vac\u3009+ is always at\n\u03b3 = 0, and the top of the barrier is always at \u03b3 = 1. We have taken the minimal allowed values for N and Nf ,\nN = 2, Nf = 7.\ncan be easily corrected in the derivation of V by using the full superpotential in both regimes, rather\nthan neglecting Wdyn at \u03b3 \u2264 1. However, it will not change anything in our considerations. Other\ncorrections which we have dropped from the final expression include perturbative corrections to the\nKahler potential. These effects are also expected to be small at scales much below the cut-off \u039bL.\nThe authors of [1] have already estimated the tunnelling rate from the metastable |vac\u3009+ to the\nsupersymmetric vacuum |vac\u30090 by approximating the potential in Figure 1 in terms of a triangle. The\naction of the bounce solution in the triangular potential is of the form,\nS4Dbounce =\n2\u03c02\n3h2\nN3\nNf\n2\n(\n\u03a60\n\u00b5\n)4\n\u223c h\n\u22126\n\u01eb4(Nf\u22123N)\/(Nf\u2212N)\n\u226b 1 for \u01eb\u226a 1 (2.15)\nThus as argued in [1] it is always possible, by choosing sufficiently small \u01eb, to ensure that the decay\ntime of the metastable vacuum to the SUSY ground state is much longer than the age of the Universe.\nOn closer inspection the constraints imposed by this condition are in any case very weak. In order\nto estimate the required value of \u01eb, note that the Euclidean action S4Dbounce gives the false vacuum decay\nrate per unit volume as\n\u03934\/V = D4e\n\u2212S4Dbounce . (2.16)\nD4 is the determinant coefficient and is irrelevant to the discussion. To determine whether the Universe\ncould have decayed (at least once) in its lifetime, we multiply the above by the space-time volume of the\npast light-cone of the observable Universe. This results in a bound to have no decay of roughly [19,23]\nS4Dbounce\n>\u223c 400.

Dynamical evolution at finite temperature\n3.1 The shape of the effective potential at finite temperature\nThe effective potential at finite temperature along the \u03a6 direction is governed by the following well-\nknown expression [24]:\nVT (\u03a6) = VT=0(\u03a6) +\nT 4\n2\u03c02\n\u2211\ni\n\u00b1ni\n\u222b\n\u221e\n0\ndq q2 ln\n(\n1\u2213 exp(\u2212\n\u221a\nq2 +m2i (\u03a6)\/T\n2)\n)\n(3.1)\nThe first term on the right hand side is the zero temperature value of the effective potential; for the\nISS model we have determined it in Eq. (2.14) and in Figure 1. The second term is the purely thermal\ncorrection (which vanishes at T = 0) and it is determined at one-loop in perturbation theory. The\nni denote the numbers of degrees of freedom present in the theory\n6 and the summation is over all of\nthese degrees of freedom. The upper sign is for bosons and the lower one for fermions. Finally, mi(\u03a6)\ndenote the masses of these degrees of freedom induced by the vevs of the field \u03a6.\nWe have noted in the previous Section that as we interpolate from the metastable vacuum to the\nsupersymmetric one, the Nf flavours of \u03d5 and \u03d5\u02dc acquire masses m\u03d5 = h\u03a6 = h\u00b5\u03b3 and become heavy at\nlarge values of \u03a6. To a good approximation all other degrees of freedom can be counted as essentially\nmassless.7 As we are not interested in the overall additive (T dependent, but field independent)\nconstant in the thermal potential, we need to include in (3.1) only those variables whose masses vary\n6Weyl fermions and complex scalars each count as n = 2.\n7In the companion paper [17] we will refine this analysis by including contributions of gauge degrees of freedom to\n(3.1). This will lead to an even lower bound for the reheat temperature, TR, necessary for the Universe to end up in the\nnon-supersymmetric |vac\u3009+.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\n0 2 4 6 8\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\nFigure 2: Thermal effective potential (3.2) for different values of the temperature. Going from bottom to top,\nthe red line corresponds to the temperature \u0398 & \u0398crit where we have only one vacuum at \u03b3 = 0. The orange\nline corresponds to \u0398 \u2248 \u0398crit where the second vacuum appears and the classical rolling stops. The green line\nis in the interval \u0398degen < \u0398 < \u0398crit where one could hope to tunnel under the barrier. The blue line is at\n\u0398 \u223c \u0398degen where the two vacua become degenerate. Finally, the black line gives the zero temperature potential\nwhere the non-supersymmetric vacuum at the origin becomes metastable.\nfrom being light in one vacuum to being heavy in the other. These are precisely the \u03d5\u2019s and \u03d5\u02dc\u2019s.

(3.2)\nThe above expression is written in terms of a dimensionless variable \u03b3 = \u03a6\/\u00b5 and we have also defined\na rescaled temperature\n\u0398 = T\/|h\u00b5| (3.3)\nIn Figure 2 we plot the thermal potential (3.2) for a few characteristic values of temperature.\nIn general one can consider a very wide range of temperatures 0 \u2264 T \u226a \u039bL corresponding to\n0 \u2264 \u0398 \u226a 1\/(h\u01eb). From Fig. 2 where we have plotted the effective potential at various temperatures\nwe immediately make out several interesting temperatures. At high enough temperature there is only\none minimum at the origin and one would expect to be able to roll down classically to the non-\nsupersymmetric minimum |vac\u3009+, as will be discussed in Section 3.2.3. Below \u0398 = \u0398crit a second\nminimum forms. It will turn out, that for our ISS potential this critical temperature will actually be\nless than \u03b30. In the following analysis, we will consider the range of temperatures h\u00b5 < T \u2264 h\u03a60\ncorresponding to 1 < \u0398 \u2264 \u03b30.\nAt temperatures below \u0398crit the SUSY breaking minimum at the origin still has lower free energy\nthen |vac\u30090. We will calculate the bubble nucleation rate to the true vacuum |vac\u3009+ in Section 3.2.2.\nAnother distinguished temperature \u0398degen is when the SUSY preserving vacuum |vac\u30090 becomes de-\ngenerate with the non-supersymmetric vacuum |vac\u3009+. For a generic potential one would expect that\n8There are only two terms in the sum in (3.2): one for bosons (+), and one for fermions (-). The prefactor 4NNf\ncounts the total number of bosonic degrees of freedom in \u03d5ai and \u03d5\u02dc\ni\na.\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nsomewhere between these two scales there is a temperature \u0398\u2217 (\u0398degen < \u0398\u2217 \u2264 \u0398crit) where the rate\nof bubble nucleation turns from large to small. Our main goal is to determine the temperature where\nthe transitions (classical or tunnelling ones) from |vac\u30090 to |vac\u3009+ stop.\n3.2 Transition to a SUSY breaking vacuum and the lower bound on TR\nIn this subsection we discuss the two possibilities for the field to evolve to the SUSY breaking vacuum\n|vac\u3009+, classical evolution and bubble nucleation.\n3.2.1 Classical evolution to the SUSY breaking vacuum: Estimate of Tcrit\nIt is clear from our expression for the thermal potential that at sufficiently high temperatures there\nis only one minimum, namely |vac\u3009+, and the SUSY preserving minimum disappears. This is caused\nby Nf flavours of \u03d5 and \u03d5\u02dc becoming heavy away from the origin. The disappearance of |vac\u30090 is most\neasily seen analytically in the limit of very high temperatures \u03b3 \u226a \u0398 where the thermal potential\ngrows as \u03982\u03b32 in the \u03b3 i.e. \u03a6 direction,\nV\u02c6\u0398 \u2212 V\u02c6\u0398=0(\u03b3) \u223c NNf \u03982\u03b32 \u2212 const\u03984 , \u0398\u226b \u03b3 = \u03a6\/\u00b5 (3.4)\nThus there is a critical temperature \u0398crit such that at \u0398 > \u0398crit there is only one minimum, and at\n\u0398 < \u0398crit the supersymmetry preserving second minimum starts to materialise.\nA better estimate can be obtained by using the approximation,\n\u00b1\n\u222b\n\u221e\n0\ndq q2 ln\n(\n1\u2213 exp(\u2212\n\u221a\nq2 + \u03b32\/\u03982)\n)\n\u223c \u03984\n( \u03b3\n2\u03c0\u0398\n) 3\n2\nexp\n(\n\u2212 \u03b3\n\u0398\n)\n, for \u03b3 \u226b \u0398 (3.5)\nfor the integral in the \u0398 dependent part of Eq. (3.2). Comparing the derivatives (first and second) of\nthe \u0398-dependent part and the \u0398-independent part of the effective potential V\u02c6\u0398 in the vicinity of \u03b30\nwe get an estimate,\n\u0398crit \u2248 \u03b30\nlog\n(\n\u03b340\/C\n) , C =\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\n3\n2\nNh2\n(\n1\u2212 Nf\nN\n)2\n(3.6)\nwhich we have also confirmed numerically.\nAlthough the height of the barrier in the zero temperature potential is only of the order of \u00b5\nwhere \u00b5 \u226a \u03b30\u00b5 = h\u03a60 the temperature necessary to erode the second minimum is only slightly\n(logarithmically) smaller than h\u03a60 due to the exponential suppression \u223c exp(\u2212\u03b3\/\u0398) apparent in Eqs.\n(3.2) and (3.5).\nIn the early Universe the situation is not static and the temperature decreases due to the expansion\nof the Universe. So one should check that even in the absence of a second minimum the field has time\nenough to evolve to |vac\u3009+ before the temperature drops below \u0398crit. We will comment on this issue\nmore in the next subsection. Here, we just point out that the temperature drops on a time scale\nMP l\/T\n2 \u226b 1\/T .\n\u2013 9 \u2013\n3.2.2 Bubble Nucleation: Estimate of T\u2217\nLet us now turn to the possibility of bubble nucleation, with an estimate of the temperature T\u2217 where\nthe transitions from |vac\u30090 to |vac\u3009+ change from fast to slow. Bubble nucleation is of course only\npossible above the temperature where the two minima become degenerate, so let us first estimate this.\nWe compare the effective potential (3.2) at the origin\nV\u02c6\u0398(\u03b3 = 0) = (N \u2212Nf )\u2212 \u03c0\n2h2\u03984\n90\n(\nnB +\n7\n8\nnF\n)\n(3.7)\nto the value of the effective potential at the second vacuum. The latter remains approximately zero\nsince the temperature Tdegen is much below \u03a60. In (3.7) nB(nF ) counts the number of bosonic(fermionic)\ndegrees of freedom (4NNF in both cases). We thus find\n\u0398degen =\n(\n12(Nf \u2212N)\nh2\u03c02NNf\n) 1\n4\n, for \u03b30 \u226b 1. (3.8)\nNow we would like to know when bubble nucleation is fast enough to lead to a phase transition. Thus\nwe consider temperatures in the range \u0398degen < \u0398 < \u0398crit such that the second vacuum |vac\u30090 is\nalready formed but still higher than |vac\u3009+. In the following we want to estimate \u0398\u2217 where tunnelling\nbecomes too slow.\nFor this purpose we will now derive a simple estimate on the action of the tunnelling trajectory\nin the thermal effective potential of the our model where the temperature is in the range \u0398degen <\n\u0398 \u2264 \u0398crit. The potential we want to model is depicted in Figure 2, its characteristic features are\nthat the \u2018false\u2019 vacuum |vac\u30090 is far away in the field space from |vac\u3009+ and that the potential climbs\nvery slowly from |vac\u30090 to a shallow barrier and then descends steeply to the \u2018true\u2019 vacuum |vac\u3009+.\nThese features are a reflection of the fact that at zero temperature the vacuum |vac\u30090 was generated\nnon-perturbatively (as reviewed in the previous Section). We will model this class of potentials with\na simple linear no-barrier potential9,\nV\u02c6lin(\u03b3) = \u03b8(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b3)NfK (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b7) (3.9)\nwhere K and \u03b7 are constants, Nf is put for convenience, and \u03b8 is the step-function. We plot this\npotential in Figure 2 for a convenient choice of constants along with the exact thermal potential. It\nis clear from this figure that the tunnelling rate for our model potential will always be a little higher\nthan in the real case.\nThe potential (3.9) admits a simple analytic solution for the bounce configuration. The tunnelling\nin this potential was discussed in detail in Ref. [26] in the T = 0 case. We have performed a similar\ncalculation in the 3-dimensional settings relevant to the thermal case. The tunnelling configuration is\nthe bounce solution \u03b3bounce(x) which extremizes the 3-dimensional action\n1\nT\nS3D =\n1\nT\n4\u03c0\n\u222b\ndr r2\n(\n1\n2TrNf (\u03a6\n\u2032)2 + VT (\u03a6)\n)\n= Nf\n4\u03c0\n\u0398h2\n\u222b\ndxx2\n(\n1\n2(\u03b3\n\u2032)2 +\n1\nNf\nV\u02c6lin(\u03b3)\n)\n(3.10)\n9We have checked the dependence on the characteristic scales of the potential using other simple approximations, for\nexample two matched quadratics and a triangular potential.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n-10\n-7.5\n-5\n-2.5\n0\n2.5\n5\nFigure 3: A simple no-barrier model for the thermal effective potential.

The right hand side of (3.10) is written in terms of our usual\ndimensionless variables \u03b3, \u0398 and the rescaled radial distance x = h\u00b5r.

The field configuration (3.12) describes a bubble of size xm with \u03b3 = 3\u03b7 on the outside at\nlarge x\u226b xm, and \u03b3 = 0 on the inside at x = 0. The asymptotic value of \u03b3bounce is the \u2018false\u2019 vacuum\n|vac\u30090, thus we should identify 3\u03b7 with \u03b30.\nThe action (3.10) on the bounce trajectory is\n1\nT\nS3Dbounce =\n4\u03c0\n\u0398h2\nNf\n8\n\u221a\n6\n5\n\u03b72+\n1\n2\nK\n1\n2\n(3.13)\nNow using the identification 3\u03b7 = \u03b30 and NfK\u03b7 \u221d \u2206V\u02c6 , where \u2206V\u02c6 is the drop in the potential which\nshould be taken to be \u2206V\u02c6 \u221d \u03984 we get\n1\nT\nS3Dbounce \u2248 const\n(\n\u03a60\nT\n)3\n(3.14)\nusing the original dimensional variables \u03a60 and T .

Assuming\nthat the Universe evolves in the standard FRW manner, we should check that the phase transition has\ntime to complete, and that the falling temperature does not \u201covertake\u201d the field.

One can argue that, in general, some kind of non-adiabatic treatment is required.\nNevertheless, we expect that our conclusions from this simple estimate remain qualitatively correct.\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nwhere on the right hand side t0 defines the time at which the temperature is T0, and we have considered\na radiation dominated Universe with scale factor a(t) \u223c (t\/t0)\n1\n2 .

This\nmeans that the field is able to roll essentially instantaneously to the origin where it undergoes coherent\noscillation.\nHaving concluded that the fields roll down to |vac\u3009+ sufficiently fast, we still need to check that\nthe oscillations of the fields around |vac\u3009+ would not bring us back to |vac\u30090 as the Universe cools. It\nis easy to see that if there was only the Hubble damping the \u03a6 field would oscillate out of the origin\nas the Universe cools. Indeed, the \u03a6 oscillations essentially preserve energy in a comoving volume;\nm2\u03a6\u03a6\n2\nmaxR\n3 = const , (3.24)\nwhere R \u223c t 12 is the scale factor in a radiation dominated Universe, and m\u03a6 = hT2 is the temperature\ninduced mass of \u03a6 at the origin. In an adiabatic regime RT = const so we find\n\u03a6max(T )\n\u03a60\n=\n\u221a\nT\nT0\n. (3.25)\nThe field would then escape from the origin because when T \u223c \u00b5, (assuming T0 \u223c \u03a60) the size of the\noscillations would be\n\u03a6max \u223c\n\u221a\n\u03a60\u00b5\u226b \u00b5. (3.26)\nFortunately, any open decay channel of \u03a6 will typically provide a damping rate \u0393\u03a6 \u223c T , capturing\nthe field in |vac\u3009+. An example are couplings to the messenger sector fields, f , of the form h\u2032f\u02dc\u03a6f.\nSince we assume thermal equilibrium, such a coupling must exist and cannot be arbitrarily weak. The\ndecaying oscillation amplitudes are of order\n\u03a6max(T )\n\u03a60\n=\n\u221a\nT\nT0\ne\u2212\n1\n2\n\u0393\u03a6(t\u2212t0). (3.27)\nSufficient damping always occurs; imposing \u03a6max < \u00b5 requires only that\nMPl\n\u03a60\n>\u223c log(\u03a60\/\u00b5) which is\nalways satisfied and the Universe ends up in the SUSY breaking state |vac\u3009+. Note, however, that the\nnumber of oscillations before damping is proportional to log(\u03a60\/\u00b5) and may be large.\n3.2.4 Lower bound on reheating temperature TR\nNow, let us summarize our analysis and explain under which conditions it is natural for the early\nUniverse to settle down at the metastable SUSY breaking vacuum. At the end of inflation the Universe\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nis in a state of very low temperature and one may assume that it is in the energetically preferred\nsupersymmetric state11 |vac\u30090. After inflation the Universe reheats to a temperature TR. Already at\nrelatively low temperatures \u223c Tdegen \u223c \u00b5 the supersymmetry breaking vacuum will have lower free\nenergy than the supersymmetric vacuum. However, if TR falls in the range Tdegen < TR . T\u2217 \u223c Tcrit,\nthe Universe will remain in the state |vac\u30090 although |vac\u3009+ is energetically preferred. It is stuck there\nbecause the barrier makes classical evolution impossible and bubble nucleation is too slow. Above\nT\u2217 the bubble nucleation rate will be high and above Tcrit the classical evolution becomes possible.\nHence, the Universe will evolve to the preferred supersymmetry breaking state |vac\u3009+. We conclude\nthat if the reheating temperature TR fulfills\nTcrit \u223c \u00b5\n\u01eb1\u22122N\/(Nf\u2212N)\n. TR .\n\u00b5\n\u01eb\n(3.28)\nit is ensured that the Universe always ends up in the supersymmetry breaking ground state12 |vac\u3009+.\nIn principle one should also consider the possibility of a transition back towards the SUSY vacuum\nfor T < Tdegen. It is known that this does not happen at zero temperature [1] . We have made a simple\nestimate of this effect at T > 0 and concluded that the Universe remains trapped. More recently, this\nhas been discussed in depth in [15\u201317].\nThe condition (2.18) or (2.19) that the metastable vacuum |vac\u3009+ is long-lived at zero temper-\nature does not necessarily require \u03a60 to be very large or \u01eb\n1\u22122N\/(Nf\u2212N) to be very small. For a low\nsupersymmetry breaking scale \u00b5 of order of a few TeV the lower bound on the reheating temperature\nin (3.28) can be easily satisfied for reheating temperatures as low as around 10 or 100 TeV. On the\nother hand, for models with a significantly higher SUSY breaking scale, this bound becomes more\nconstraining.\n4. Conclusions and discussion\nWe have examined the consequences of meta-stable SUSY breaking vacua in a cosmological setting.\nAs noted in [1], the ISS theory naturally admits a finite number of isolated supersymmetric vacua\n(as determined by the Witten index) along with a larger moduli space of metastable SUSY breaking\nvacua. Since the latter is a much bigger configuration space, ISS suggested that it is more favorable\nfor the Universe to be populated in the metastable SUSY breaking vacua. In this paper, we have\nconsidered thermal effects in the ISS model and have shown that the early Universe is always driven to\nmetastability: as long as the SUSY breaking sector is in thermal equilibrium this provides a generic,\ndynamical explanation why supersymmetry became broken. This phenomenon is a consequence of\ntwo distinguishing properties of the ISS theory which are not necessarily shared by other models\nwith metastable SUSY breaking vacua, namely, that the metastable minima have more light degrees\nof freedom than the SUSY preserving vacua, and that the metastable vacua are separated from the\n11If it is already in the supersymmetry breaking vacuum, |vac\u3009+, it will stay there.\n12In this estimate we ignore weak logarithmic corrections in \u01eb.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nSUSY preserving vacuum by a very shallow dynamically induced potential. Both play significant roles\nin our argument and our various estimates.\nGiven the current interest in \u201dlandscapes\u201d of one variety or another, it is difficult to resist specu-\nlating on their implications for the ISS models, given the conclusions of our study. One longstanding\nproblem that can be addressed in this context is that of the hierarchy between the Planck and su-\npersymmetry breaking scales. Consider the possibility that the SUSY breaking sector has in fact a\nlarge number of product groups, with a landscape of metastable ISS minima into which the Universe\ncould be thermally driven, with a range of values of SUSY breaking. The very existence of the lower\nbound on TR implies that there is a maximal value of a SUSY breaking scale \u00b5 which characterizes\nmetastable vacua we can reach as the Universe cools down. Using our estimate for TR, Eq. (3.28) we\nfind\n\u00b5 \u223c \u039bL\n(\nTR\n\u039bL\n)Nf\u2212N\n2N\n, (4.1)\nwhere \u039bL is the Landau pole of the theory. Thus not only is the SUSY breaking determined to lie\nbelow \u039bL, it is also parametrically suppressed by powers of TR\/\u039bL.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Sakis Dedes, Stefan Forste and George Georgiou for discussions and valuable comments.\nCSC is supported by an EPSRC Advanced Fellowship and VVK by a PPARC Senior Fellowship.\nReferences\n[1] K.
