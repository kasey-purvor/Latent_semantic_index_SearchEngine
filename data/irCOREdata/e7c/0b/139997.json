Quantum size effects in semiconductors \n \nWhen solids are reduced in size to the nanometric scale, the Coulomb interaction felt by the electrons is notably \naffected. As a consequence, the energy bands rearrange into new configurations, leading to new material properties. \nThese are known as quantum size effects (QSE)  [1]. \n \nThe most relevant QSE on nanoscaled semiconductors for light emission applications is a size-dependant band-gap \nwidening. The enlargement of the prohibited band shifts the associated emission wavelength towards more energetic \nparts of the electromagnetic spectrum. As a result, semiconductors whose bulk emission wavelength was in the infrared \nare open to visible radiation when in the nanoscale. A well documented example is CdTe, whose bulk band-gap is \n1.56eV and emits in the infrared; for nanometric size particles, emissions in the whole visible spectrum have been \nreported  [2-6]. \n \nAnother important QSE is the splitting of the lower exciton state for electrons and holes into different levels of different \nspin configuration with an energy difference in the order of a few meV [2,7]. Thermal activation at room temperature is \nthen enough to fill these states with carriers. As a consequence, the radiative recombination is no longer restricted by the \nspin statistics that set a theoretical limit of 25% efficiency. Therefore the radiative efficiency in such devices can be \nmuch higher than 25% with reports of 80% common place in the literature. \n \n2. Nanostructured semiconductor light emitting devices (NSLED) \n \nNSLEDs have been thoroughly investigated in the last decade. High PL efficiency have been reported for nanocrystals \nof several types of semiconductors  [4,8]. This high PL efficiency encouraged researchers to try to electrically stimulate \nlight emission with a high EL yield. A large range of semiconductors have been employed in NSLEDs: CdTe, CdSe, \nCdS, ZnS are amoung the most common although others have been used.  Different nanocrystals deposition techniques \nhave been employed (spin-coating, layer-by-layer, dip-coating\u2026) along with different suspension solvents to generate \nthe active layer. The active layer has to be homogeneous and free from defects if the device is to have a good overall \nefficiency. \n \nA typical device structure is a sandwich of a single or multilayer of nanocrystals between the chosen electrodes. ITO has \nbeen traditionally used as transparent anode, due to its high work function that improves hole injection. Low work \nfunction metals like Al, Ca and Mg have been used as the cathode. These increase the electron injection into the active \nlayer.  [9] However, so far low EL efficiencies have been obtained  [5,10], another problem is that the device lifetime \nremains an issue [2,11,12]. The presence of pinholes is also a common problem in the manufacturing of these structures, \nleading to abnormally high current density levels that destroy the device or reduce their lifetime even further [13]. \n \nThe use of an organic hole transport layer has been an extended practice for many groups. The role of this layer is to \nimprove hole injection into the nanocrystals. Conducting polymers like PAni, PPV, PEDOT:PSS and others present a \nhighest occupied molecular level (HOMO) that is energetically below the conduction level of ITO, providing a better \nmatching with the semiconductor valence band [4,5,10,11]. However, a second but no less important role is the \nprevention of pinholes. Conductive polymers are normally deposited through spin-coating from organic solvent \nsolutions, yielding well homogeneous layers with a thickness as high as 200-300nm. As a payback, the limitations of \norganic compounds are eventually added to the structure. Combinations of semiconductor nanoparticles and \nelectroluminescent polymers have also been extensively studied as a way to stimulate either polymer or nanoparticle \nemission [6,12,14]. Although improved PL and\/or EL have been found in some cases, new problems emerged \nassociated to the interaction between both species. Additionally, electroluminescent polymers have frequently a high \noxidation susceptibility, adding difficulty to the manufacture process and the operation of the devices. Finally, the \nintroduction of organic materials within the structure posses some risks concerning thermal stability for the final device. \n \nIn this article, the results of the investigation of NSLEDs based on red CdTe nanocrystals is presented. No organic \nmaterials have been employed with an active part in light emission. The different problems presented so far by these \ndevices have been directly addressed. \n \n \nEXPERIMENTAL \n \nSamples consisted in a stacked structure in which the active layer was sandwiched between the electrodes. The \nsubstrates were bits of 26mm x 18mm cut from an ITO-coated glass sheet as supplied from Merk. The ITO on these cut \npieces were covered with a steel mask and a cellulose laquer (from RS) was sprayed on the top. After the removal of the \nmask, laquer strips of either 2mm or 4mm width protected the underlying ITO. The substrates were then etched using \nhydrochloric acid 60% Vol. in water at 50\u00baC for 5 minutes to remove the unprotected ITO, leaving only the ITO strips \non the substrates. A thorough ultrasonic cleaning with isopropanol and acetone, and a final baking at 140\u00baC for 12 hours \ncompleted the substrate preparation. High PL efficiency thiol-capped CdTe nanocrystals were deposited onto the \nsubstrates from a colloidal water solution. The size of the nanocrystals was around 3nm. For this step a modified a \nlayer-by-layer (LbL)  [15,16] technique was used. The samples were submerged in a commercial water solution of 20% \npoly-(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDDA) diluted to 0.5%. Then, the samples were rinsed for 5 min in distilled water \nand immersed in the CdTe solution for 10min. This was followed by another 5min rinsing [17]. The process was \nrepeated until the required number of layers was deposited. This procedure was done either by hand or using a robotized \narm. For the robotized procedure, a slow withdrawing of the samples from the solutions was programmed for an \nefficient solvent removal. Aluminium electrodes were deposited through a steel shadow mask using a thermal \nevaporator from Edwards. The electrodes were 4mm width, forming active areas of either 8mm2 or 16mm2 where they \ncrossed with the underlying ITO strips. \n \nA Digital instruments DI3000 AFM system operating in tapping mode was used for surface characterization. Ultra high \nprecision SEM micrographs of device cross sections were taken using a field emission gun (SFEG) XL30 Philips SEM. \nThickness and roughness measurements were assisted by a Veeco Dektak profilometer. .Absorbance measurements \nwere carried out with a Lambda 7 UV-Vis spectrometer from Perkin-Elmer. PL spectra were obtained with a Fluorolog \n3 spectrofluorimeter with a 450W xenon lamp, with 2nm slits for excitation and detection, and an excitation light of \n450nm. EL spectra were taken with the same equipment, blocking the light source and using a 10nm detector slit. PL \ninspection was carried out under a 356nm UV light.  \n \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nAbsorbance measurements were carried out on CdTe colloidal solutions diluted in water, as a preliminary stage. The \nresulting data is presented in figure 1. Taking into account that CdTe is a direct band-gap semiconductor, the energy \nband-gap can be calculated through the proportionality  [18]: \n( ) ( )2 GA E E E\u22c5 \u221d \u2212     (1) \n \nwhere A is the measured absorption, E is the excitation energy and EG is the bang-gap value. The calculated value for \nthis last parameter was EG=2.0eV. According to refs.  \n[19,20], it would correspond to a particle size around 2.5-\n3.5nm, matching the data from the nanocrystals \nmanufacturing. \n \nIn the first stage of research, devices of 1 to 10 layers were \nprepared using a manual LbL procedure following ref.  [2]. \nThe use of organic poly-electrolytes does not pose a threat \non the device performance, because these polymers are \nused as a gluing passive element, taking no part in light \nemission. \nCross sections and surface analyses were carried out on \nthese samples using SFEG and AFM microscopes. The \nsurface images revealed a very porous structure (fig.2), \nwith the nanoparticles arranged in clusters of 15-20nm. \nWith a nanoparticle size in solution in the range of 2nm to \n5nm, it was concluded that the nanoparticles were \nagglomerating during the deposition stage.

Absorption spectrum of CdTe nanocrystals in \nwater solution. \n   \nFig.2. SFEG and AFM images of the multilayer surface. The high porosity of the multilayer favours the \ndevelopment of pinholes. \nimages showed a very rough surface (fig.3), presumably due to the porosity of the CdTe multilayers. The thicknesses of \na monolayers were around 30nm. Profilometer scans supported those data, summarized in table 1. \nTable 1. LbL methods comparison \nMethod Roughness Thickness Thickness (per monolayer) \nManual (10 layers) 100 nm 300nm 30nm \nAutomated (50 layers) Below resolution 150nm 3nm \n \nI-V measurements revealed currents densities of the order of 100mA\/cm2 in most of the samples even at low voltages \n(1.0-2.0V), until electric failure which was signalled by current spikes and the device sparking. Prompt PL loss was \nrevealed under UV light, due to the developing of heat within the structure. Little success was attained in EL, where \nemission faded out rapidly (5 minutes maximum) without allowing for EL spectrometry. The light, though faint, was \nvisible for the naked eye and clearly red. These results indicated that the development of pinholes during the top \nelectrode deposition induced high short-circuiting currents that eventually destroyed the samples and prevented light \nemission. The abundance of pinholes was related to the structural porosity observed under the microscopes. The fast lost \nof EL was related to the introduction of oxygen within the structure. The LbL takes place in air, due to the high stability \nof the nanoparticles. Ulterior long vacuum exposure helps to remove the air and moisture that could remain in the \nsample. But porosity makes this process more difficult and, as a result, the lifetime of the device is considerably \nshortened. To overcome the pinholes issue without using \nadditional components in the device, the LbL stage \ndemanded a significant improvement. \n \nPoly-ethylenimine (PEI) was used in the LbL process as \nthe first polyelectrolyte, favouring the adhesion to the \nsubstrate surface, while PDDA is used for subsequent \nlayers. It has been reported [17] that PEI molecular chains \nare keen to form filaments that hang out off the surface; \nthese filaments can surround a number of particles forming \na protruding agglomerate that favours further growth. On \nthe other hand, PDDA tends to form more homogeneous \nlayers and no filament formation have been reported. Thus, \nPEI was excluded from subsequent the LbL process. \nSamples were prepared with equal numbers of layers, with \nand without PEI as a first polyelectrolyte, to test the \nadhesion of CdTe by absorbance measurements. The \nresults of comparative absorbance indicated that the \nsuppression of PEI did not affect the amount of CdTe \nattached to the substrates. Additionally, a manual LbL \n \nFig.3. Cross section of an active area. The top layer is \naluminium, followed by a thick area, the CdTe \nmultilayers. The ITO is distinguishable as a thin layer \nright over the glass. \n \nFig.4.

An 8mm2 emitting area. \nprocess leads to very inhomogeneous deposition, with an added risk of scratching of the samples. Moreover, the process \nis long and time consuming. A robotic arm was programmed to carry out the LbL process. Figure 4 shows a cross \nsection of a 50 x CdTe multilayer produced by the robot, with an overall thickness of 150nm. The 150nm thick ITO \nlayer, observable below the CdTe, gives an idea of the thickness of the active layers, that results in a value around 3nm \nper layer.  This number matched the previous data about the size of the nanoparticles. Also, it indicated that the different \nCdTe layers were actually monolayers of nanoparticles, rather than a porous stack of nanoparticles aggregates. A \ndramatic improvement in roughness at long scales can be also appreciated. Data is summarized in table 1, comparing \nmanual and automatic depositions. \nSamples with 10 layers of CdTe produced through the automated method were covered with aluminium electrodes. An \nAl minimum thickness of 100nm was always employed to prevent oxidation. The samples showed resistivities over \n1K\u2126 in every area, constituting a first confirmation of the efficient removal of pinholes. It was possible to obtain EL \nvisible to the eye from several areas (see fig.5), with a turn on voltage around 3V and current densities between 375-\n700mA\/cm2. However, the EL was always lost after 5-10 minutes of operation. \n \nAdditionally, a significant loss of PL was detected after Al deposition on many areas under UV-lamp inspection. This \nPL loss was later followed by a total absence of EL. A problem due to thermal effects during Al deposition was judged \nto be a possible reason for the loss of PL. The heat radiated by the filaments during the evaporation could be heating the \nsamples to the point of chemical degradation of the CdTe nanoparticles. In consequence, the distance between the \nsamples to be coated and the filaments within the chamber was doubled to around 30cm. Newly produced samples \nshowed an improved PL under UV-light, supporting the hypothesis of PL loss by heating. Typical normalized EL and \nPL spectra are showed in figure 6. As can be seen, there was a steady growth of EL intensity with voltage, until a \nmaximum was achieved (6V in figure 6), marking an optimal voltage. If the voltage was increased further, little or none \nhigher EL intensity was obtained (7V in figure. 6). This fact is clearly shown in figure 7, where the relative EL quantum \nefficiency has been estimated dividing the integrated EL intensity by the corresponding current density  [6,21]. If this \noverloading voltage, higher than the optimal value, was kept a few tens of seconds, the samples rapidly lost their EL \nwhile a sudden increase of several orders in current could be detected. \n \nThe reason for this behaviour still needs further investigation. However, the hypothesis of electronic avalanche seems \nplausible. Due to the thinness of the active layers, the electric fields into these samples can reach values of around \n106V\/cm. At these high fields the electrons could have enough energy to free additional electrons by collision \n(scattering). The new freed electrons can free additional electrons in an avalanche effect. EL was recoverable if the \noverload time lasted only a few seconds, supporting the avalanche hypothesis. Longer periods under current overload \nirreversibly destroyed the emitting areas, probably by local heating. The avalanche hypothesis for EL loss at voltages \nhigher than the optimal point can be investigated by varying the number of layers within the structure.

Current density (J) and relative EL quantum \nefficiency vs. voltage. EL efficiency loss is observable \nafter 6V,the optimal point for this sample. \navalanche is normally triggered when the electric field reaches a critical value, characteristic of each semiconductor \n(e.g. Si with 2\u00d7105V\/cm). If the rupture point were detected at the same field for different sample thicknesses, it would \nbe a definitive support for this hypothesis.  \n \nAnother finding was a dramatically extended lifetime in air for these new samples. An optimal value of voltage was \napplied to an active area and kept constant for an hour, while taking EL spectra every 5 minutes. These analyses were \ncarried out on several areas of different samples, under typical laboratory temperatures and atmosphere, with results \nsimilar to the one shown in fig 8. An initial fluctuation of the EL intensity was observable during the first 10-15 \nminutes, after which the EL relatively stabilized (fig 9). The reasons for the extended lifetime are thought to be entirely \nrelated with the modified processing of the samples. As has been discussed previously, the lower porosity of  the \nnanocrystals layers reduced the density of pinholes. This reduction could push local fields below the avalanche level. \nAnother factor seemed to be related with the new conditions for the Al deposition. The reduced thermal damage over \nthe nanocrystals could have helped to preserve their organic coating, extending their lifetime. Additionally, the \nthickness of the Al electrodes, over 150nm, is probably preventing any oxidation of the nanoparticles during operation \nin air. \n \nAlthough standard irradiance measurements have not yet been performed, it was clear by eye inspection that the \nbrightness of these samples was still low in comparison with other light emission mechanisms. Despite very high EL \nquantum efficiencies are theoretically possible with these devices, low brightness remains a problem for reasons still \nunknown. Other kind of analyses are open for research now that the operational lifetime in air has been successfully \nextended. \n \n \nCONCLUSSIONS \n \nNSLEDs production processes have been optimized in different ways for improved manufacturing and electrical \nperformances. High homogeneity and low roughness have been achieved with automated and controlled deposition of \nsemiconductor nanoparticle layers, leading to improved electrical characteristics. All the deposition process is carried \nout in normal laboratory conditions, eliminating complicated and expensive controlled environment requirements. \nAdditionally, the production yield (the proportion of valid samples within a batch) has grown over the 90%. Continuous \nstable operation in air have been demonstrated through the constancy of electrical and luminescence variables. As a \nresult of the in-air extended lifetime operation, further analysis are now possible to address remaining issues that before \nwere impossible to be carried out because of the fast degradation of the samples. The brightness of the samples, as an \nexample, needs to be improved further for commercial applications. \n \n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.1\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\nTime (min)\nEL\nm\nax\n (a\n.u\n.)\n \nFig.9 EL peak-intensity evolution in time. \n50\n0\n52\n2\n54\n4\n56\n6\n58\n8\n61\n0\n63\n2\n65\n4\n67\n6\n69\n8\n72\n0\n74\n2\n0min\n15min\n30min\n45min\n60min\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nEL\n (a\n.u\n.)\n\u03bb (nm)\n \nFig.8 EL spectra for times between 0min and 60min. \nThe low dispersion of data highlights the stability of EL \nin time. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nWe would like to thank Dr N.P.
