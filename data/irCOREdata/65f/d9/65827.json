INTRODUCTION\nThere is considerable interest in the properties of new\nmesomorphic materials, which are composed of molecules\nwith novel architectures. These include rod-coil molecules,1\npolyphilic molecules,2 ternary block-copolymers,3 and den-\ndritic molecules.4 In each of these systems it is possible to\ncombine molecular segments containing mesogenic moieties\nwith separate segments which contain flexible entities. It is\nalso possible to combine molecular segments with radically\ndifferent types of molecular interactions ~for example, ali-\nphatic, aromatic, fluoro, and siloxane-based segments! to in-\nduce microphase separation. The combination of rigidity\/\nflexibility and microphase separation opens up a wide-\nvariety of possibilities for new self-assembled structures and\nhas led to a series of novel mesophase morphologies.5\nIn the case of liquid crystalline dendrimers ~LCDr!, there\nis the possibility of incorporating mesogenic groups into the\nbody of the dendrimer, which can lead to the formation of\ncalamitic nematic and smectic thermotropic phases.6 Or al-\nternatively, mesogenic groups can be bonded to the \u2018\u2018sur-\nface\u2019\u2019 of a dendrimer.7 The latter raises an interesting possi-\nbility. Conformational changes in the structure of the\ndendrimer could allow it to rearrange the distribution of ter-\nminal mesogenic groups. This provides a mechanism for for-\nmation of different types of mesophase. For example, with\ncarbosilane LCDrs it has been suggested that the dendrimer\ncan form rods leading to smectic-A phase formation; or form\ndiscs which can pack to form columns, leading in turn to the\nformation of columnar mesophases.8\nThere have been a number of previous studies of simple\nbead models for nonliquid crystalline dendrimers.9\u201311 In this\npaper we carry out the first simulation of a liquid crystalline\ndendrimer in solution. A detailed model for a third genera-\ntion carbosilane dendrimer is studied in the presence of a\nmesogenic solvent. We employ a hybrid model in which all\nheavy atoms in the nonmesogenic parts of the dendrimer are\nrepresented by Lennard-Jones sites, and both the mesogenic\ngroups and the solvent are represented by anisotropic ~Gay\u2013\nBerne! sites. There is great interest in the structure of such\ndendrimers in solution, not least because they provide an\ninsight into how the terminal mesogenic groups are able to\norder by rearrangement of the dendrimer structure. More-\nover, LCDrs can be used in nematic liquid crystal phases\n~dendrimer filled nematics! to produce polarizer free liquid\ncrystal displays,12,13 which work by controlling light scatter-\ning. In this case, application of an electric field causes re-\nalignment of nematic domains within the structure, providing\nswitching from a scattering to a transparent mode. Finally,\nsolution studies of a LCDrs provide a first stage towards the\nsimulation of bulk mesophases, and a more detailed under-\nstanding of the structures dendritic molecules adopt in the\nbulk.\nThe layout of this paper is as follows: The simulation\nmodel is described in Sec. II, results for the structure of the\nmodel dendrimer in isotropic, nematic, and smectic solvents\nare presented in Sec. III, finally we draw some conclusions in\nSec. IV.\nII. SIMULATION MODEL\nA. Liquid crystalline dendrimer\nThe simulation model used is based on a simplified\nstructure for a third generation carbosilane dendrimer. The\nchemical structure of the real dendrimer is shown in Fig.\n1~a!, and a schematic two-dimensional diagram is shown in\nFig. 1~b! highlighting the silicon atom branching points, the\nconnecting chains and the terminal mesogenic groups.

In the rest of the dendrimer each\nheavy atom ~silicon, carbon, and oxygen! is replaced by a\nsingle united atom Lennard-Jones site, which incorporates\nany hydrogens attached to these atoms. This gives a total of\nNLJ\n(1)5781 LJ sites and NGB\n(1)532 GB sites in the model.\nBuilding an initial stable nonoverlapping configuration\nfor a complicated dendrimer is nontrivial. In this work, the\nbackbone of the dendrimer was generated as a branched net-\nwork using a simple geometric algorithm, to which hydro-\ngens were added to complete the valency of each heavy\natom. At the initial stage the mesogenic units were repre-\nsented by a rigid rod of Lennard-Jones atoms. Monte Carlo\nsimulations of this \u2018\u2018all-atom\u2019\u2019 model were carried to elimi-\nnate close contacts and overlaps. We used the internal coor-\ndinate Monte Carlo program developed by one of the\nauthors,15 which proved particularly effective for this type of\nproblem. When a relaxed conformation was reached the hy-\ndrogen atoms were stripped off, and each heavy atom was\nreplaced by a single LJ site, and the rigid rods were replaced\nby GB sites.\nThree types of nonbonded interactions are required: LJ\u2013\nLJ, GB\u2013GB, and LJ\u2013GB. For the LJ sites, values of sLJ\n53.93 \u00c5 and eLJ \/kB547 K ~taken from Ref. 16! were used,\nwhich are appropriate for a united atom hydrocarbon model,\nand the cutoff distance for the potential was set to rc ,1\n59.8 \u00c5 ([2.5sLJ). For the GB sites we use the cut and\nshifted form of the potential studied by Brown and\nco-workers,17 employing a length\/breadth ratio k53.5 and a\nside-to-side\/end-to-end well depth ratio of k855. To scale to\nreal units, values of sGB53.829 \u00c5 ~estimated from the di-\nmensions of the mesogenic unit! and eGB \/kB5406.15 K\n~from Ref. 18! were employed and the cutoff distance was\nset at rc ,2522 \u00c5 ([5.75sGB). The extended GB potential19\nwas employed to describe the LJ\u2013GB interactions. Here\nwe used sLJ\/GB5(sGB2 1sLJ2 )1\/2\/&\u20193.88 \u00c5 and eLJ\/GB\/kB\n5(eGBeLJ)1\/2\/kB\u2019138.16 K, with a cutoff distance of rc ,3\n516.5 \u00c5. All nonbonded potentials were shifted at the speci-\nfied cutoff distances. The three cutoff distances were chosen\nto give approximately the same maximum numerical error\nfor the potential at the cutoff ~the maximum error corre-\nsponds to an end-to-end separation in the GB potential and at\na point along the GB-axis vector in the LJ\u2013GB interaction!.\nThe intermolecular interactions are described by a\nsimple harmonic force field of the form\nE intra5 (\nbonds\nkbond\n2 ~ l2leq!\n21 (\nangles\nkangle\n2 ~u2ueq!\n2\n1 (\ndihedrals\n~a0,dih1a1,dih cos f1a2,dih cos\n2 f\n1a3,dih cos\n3 f!, ~1!\nwhere the parameters take their usual meaning. In this work,\nwe make use of the branched-alkane force field of Vlugt\net al.16 The force field is extended to the case of anisotropic\nsites, by adding an additional harmonic \u2018\u2018GB-angle\u2019\u2019 interac-\ntion to keep the terminal GB sites parallel to the bonds join-\ning them to the alkyl chain.18 The full set of parameters used\nis summarized in Table I. Further details of this hybrid\nLJ\/GB model can be found in our earlier work on liquid\ncrystal dimers.18\nB. Dendrimer in an LC solvent\nThe solvent systems were modeled by GB sites with the\nsame parametrization as those of the LCDr end groups. Sol-\nvent simulations were started from a lattice containing 4732\nsolvent sites and equilibrated for 1 ns of time employing a\ntimestep Dt53 fs at fixed temperature T5400 K and differ-\nent pressures. From this set of simulations we picked up\nFIG. 1. ~a!

In\nour parametrization, the temperature of T5400 K corre-\nsponds to the reduced temperature T*5kBT\/e0\nGB50.984,\nand we found that the state points appear to be in very good\nagreement with the results of Ref. 17 where the phase dia-\ngrams for GB potentials with adjacent values of k53.4 and\nk53.6 have been studied.\nThe LCDr ~as prepared in Sec. II A!, was equilibrated\ninitially in the gas phase using constant temperature molecu-\nlar dynamics ~MD! at 400 K ~1 fs timestep!, which yielded\nan isotropic arrangement of mesogenic groups. The isotropic\nLCDr was then placed in the three different solvents.\nSolvent\/dendrimer overlaps were eliminated by removing\nany solvent molecules that directly overlapped with part of\nthe dendrimer. As a result, the number of GB sites in the\nsolvent dropped down to values of NGB\n(2)54442 ~isotropic\nphase!, NGB\n(2)54441 ~nematic phase! and NGB\n(2)54426\n~smectic-A phase!. Finally, long ~1 fs timestep! MD runs\nwere performed for each mixture ~1.0 ns isotropic phase\n\u20134.5 ns smectic-A phase!, using the same constant tem-\nperature (T5400 K) and pressure (p50.018, 0.021,\n0.023 kg s22 \u00c521) used in the original solvent equilibration.\nIn all simulations, the equations of motion were solved\nusing a variant of the leap frog algorithm, which is suitable\nfor both anisotropic and isotropic particles. The simulations\nemployed the GBMOLDD program, which is a domain de-\ncomposition parallel molecular dynamics program developed\nby the authors. The basic program and algorithm used is\ndescribed in Ref. 20 and the extension to the NpT ensemble\nis described in Ref. 21.\nTo monitor the orientational order in the mixture four\nuniaxial order parameters were introduced. The general\nformula\nS5^P2~cos u i!& ~2!\napplies to each, where u i is the angle between the long axis\nof the GB particle, ei , and the director. The latter is defined\ndifferently for each order parameter. For the total order pa-\nrameter, Smix , the average in Eq. ~2! is performed over all\nNGB\n(1)1NGB\n(2) sites with the director defined globally. Sden is\nmeasured for dendrimer GB sites only, using their own local\ndirector. Ssolv is defined in the same way but by averaging\nover solvent GBs. Finally, Sd\/s is defined by averaging over\nall dendrimer GB sites, but measuring u i with respect to the\ndirector of the solvent.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 2 shows a sequence of three configurations taken\nfrom the equilibration run of the dendrimer in an isotropic\nsolvent. As expected, the dendrimer adopts a spherical shape,\nwith the alkyl chains wrapping around the core and the ter-\nminal mesogenic units arranged randomly near the surface of\nthe dendrimer. Under good solvent conditions, we would ex-\npect the alkyl chains to be well-solvated by the Gay\u2013Berne\nsolvent molecules and the solvent to penetrate into some of\nthe central regions of the dendrimer. However, the snapshots\nindicate that this is not the case. In Fig. 3 we compare the\nradius of gyration, Rg , of LJ sites for simulations in the gas\nphase and in the isotropic solvent. In the isotropic phase,\nafter an initial equilibration period, the radius of gyration\nTABLE I.

The strength of GB\u2013GB interactions means that\nthe GB potential effectively acts as a poor solvent for the LJ\nparts of the LCDr. The terminal GB sites are therefore ex-\ncluded from the globular center of the dendrimer but remain\nin intimate contact with the surrounding solvent. In the nem-\natic and smectic phases the dendrimer contracts slightly, with\nthe radius of gyration falling to 14.15 \u00c5 in the nematic and\n13.95 \u00c5 in the smectic phase, suggesting that the alkyl\nchains are wrapped more tightly around the core in these\nsolvents. The relatively rapid fluctuations in Rg about the\nmean value are caused by conformational changes in the\nalkyl chains surrounding the core. It is these conformational\nchanges that lead to changes in dendrimer structure in differ-\nent solvents ~see below!.\nIt is interesting to compare Fig. 2 with similar snapshots\ntaken from the simulation in the nematic solvent ~Fig. 4!. In\nthe nematic phase a structural change occurs in the LCDr\nover the course of 4 ns, the dendrimer core adapts a similar\nstructure to the isotropic phase but the terminal mesogenic\nunits align to lie close to the solvent director. This occurs\nthrough a rearrangement of alkyl chain conformations ~see\ndiscussion below! resulting in the dendrimer forming a rod\nshape. The process of alignment is shown through the series\nof order parameters plotted in Fig. 5. Initially, a small drop in\nthe order of solvent, Ssolv , is seen immediately after the den-\ndrimer is immersed. After this, Ssolv , recovers to its original\nvalue, and Sden and Sd\/s grow until both reach approximately\nthe same value as Ssolv , Smix . The core of the dendrimer acts\nas a defect in the nematic but has only a minor ~local! effect\non the order of the solvent as a whole. It is interesting to note\nthat the rod-shaped structures seen in the third snapshot of\nFig. 4 have been postulated to be responsible for smectic-A\nphase formation in generation three carbosilane dendrimers\nwith cyanobiphenyl terminal groups.8 In that study x-ray\nmeasurements from bulk dendrimer mesophases show mea-\nsured spacings consistent with layers of mesogenic groups\nsandwiched between a soft dendritic matrix. While no direct\nquantitative comparison is possible for the system studied\nhere, the simulations lend weight to the LCDr packing mod-\nels suggested elsewhere,8,22 indicating that whole-scale rear-\nrangement of the LCDr structure can be driven by changes in\nthe ordering of mesogenic units. ~In bulk phases, there is also\nan additional packing consideration, as discussed in the mo-\nlecular theory of Vanakaras and Photinos.23 In some den-\ndrimer systems we might expect strong thermodynamic se-\nlection of conformations according to their packing\nefficiency, this could have the effect of enhancing shape tran-\nsitions from sphere to rod in the bulk dendrimer.!\nFigure 6 shows the change in orientational order as the\ndendrimer is immersed in the smectic-A phase.

Thereafter the dendrimer order parameter fluctu-\nates between values of Sden\u2019Sd\/s\u20190.65\u2013 0.75, which is\nslightly lower than the solvent order parameter Ssolv . The\nsnapshots in Fig. 7 show that major disruption is caused to\nthe smectic layering close to the surface of the dendrimer,\nbut within a distance of two\/three molecular lengths from the\ndendrimer, the layers have recovered their undistorted form.\nIt is interesting to note that the rod-shaped structure, seen in\nthe nematic solvent, is not as pronounced in the smectic-A.\nThis is because the mesogenic groups of the dendrimer are\ndistributed over five separate smectic layers.\nThe radial distribution functions, r(r) ~averaged over all\nspatial directions! have been built for generation 2, genera-\ntion 3, and the solvent; using the center of the dendrimer as\nthe reference point for the plots. For the solvent we replaced\neach GB site by three adjacent spherical sites along the long\naxis of the former ~this enhances the number density of the\nsolvent allowing it to be displayed on the same scale at the\nLJ sites!. For easy comparison the results for different sol-\nvents are presented in three separate plots in Fig. 8. Out to\nthe branching point of generation 3, the dendrimer is rela-\ntively rigid so we get relatively narrow peaks corresponding\nto the united atoms in each generation. In contrast, the alkyl\nchains on the periphery of the dendrimer exhibit quite a\nbroad distribution function. This arises because the chains\nare able to penetrate into the inner core of the dendrimer.\nThis is consistent both with earlier simulations of simpler\ndendrimer systems, and experimental work. Karatasos et al.9\nhave carried out simulations of a bead\u2013spring model den-\ndrimer for generations 3\u20136. For beads in the outer shell of\nthe G6 dendrimer, they notice considerable backfolding re-\nsulting with some beads appearing close to the core. Solid\nstate rotational-echo double-resonance ~REDOR! nuclear\nmagnetic resonance ~NMR! measurements for a flexible den-\ndrimer provide similar evidence for backfolding.24\nAs noted in the snapshots, there is little penetration of\nFIG. 6.

However,\nit is evident that Gay\u2013Berne particles are able to penetrate\nsome of the region occupied by the alkyl chains. This is\nprobably due to instantaneous cavities that appear as a result\nof conformational changes in the alkyl chains as they wrap\naround the dendrimer core. Within statistical noise the differ-\nences between the radially averaged distributions for the\nthree solvents are minimal.\nThe other question we would like to address concerns\nthe isotropy of the dendrimer core in the cases of the nematic\nand smectic solvents. Particularly, we are interested whether\nor not the core is elongated in a direction collinear with the\nnematic director ~which seems to be evident from the snap-\nshots in Figs. 4 and 7!. To answer this we calculated the\npartial radial distribution functions, r i(r) within the conelike\nsectors limited by the angle u5p\/6 around the head and tail\ndirections of the nematic director, and r\u2019(r), within the sec-\ntor with the values for uP@p\/3,2p\/3# rad @u corresponds to\nthe polar angle in the spherical coordinates where the z axis\n(u50) coincides with the nematic director#. The results are\nshown in Fig. 9 for different solvent phases. From these plots\nit is evident that there is significant anisotropy in the distri-\nbution of flexible alkyl chains in both nematic and smectic-A\nphases. In the nematic and smectic-A phases the chains tend\nto gather on the top and the bottom of the dendrimer core in\na direction collinear with the nematic director. There is also a\npeak that develops at 9 \u00c5 in the r i(r) plot for the third\ngeneration core within the nematic phase, which indicates\nsome distortion of the outer part of the core along the nem-\natic director. However, within statistical errors, the anisot-\nropy in generation 2 is small. As expected, in both the nem-\natic and smectic phases the solvent is able to penetrate\nfurther into the dendrimer in a direction perpendicular to the\ndirector. From these plots it seems likely that the chains ful-\nfill the major role in allowing the LCDr to adapt its structure\nto best suit its environment. It seems highly plausible that a\nsimilar role is played in the bulk.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have carried out simulation studies of the structure of\na model third generation liquid crystalline dendrimer in iso-\ntropic, nematic, and smectic-A solvents. We find the den-\ndrimer core largely remains spherical in all three solvents,\nbut that significant changes in shape occur for the rest of the\nmolecule. These changes are facilitated by conformational\nfluctuations in the alkyl chains, which link the mesogenic\ngroups to the core of the LCDr. They allow the dendrimer as\na whole to become elongated along the nematic director and\nthe terminal mesogenic groups to align with an order param-\neter approaching that of the solvent. The elongation of the\nLCDr to form rod-shaped structures is consistent with sug-\ngestions for how third generation carbosilane dendrimers\npack within a bulk smectic phase. However, this can only be\nconfirmed by a simulation of the bulk smectic phase itself,\nwhich at the current time remains computationally expensive\nfor a model of the type studied here.\nWe find some penetration of the liquid crystal solvent\ninto the region occupied by the alkyl chains but negligible\npenetration into the region occupied by the dendrimer core.\nHowever, the alkyl chains themselves are able to backfold\nand occupy some spaces within the core. This opens up pos-\nsibilities for a simplified ~coarse-grained! dendrimer model\nwhere the core is represented by a single ~soft! spherical\npotential. The bulk phases of one such model are under in-\nvestigation currently within our laboratory.\nAn interesting future extension to this work, could in-\nvolve the addition of several more dendrimer molecules to\nthe nematic solution to produce a dendrimer-filled nematic\n~DFN!, which is believed to contain multiple poorly corre-\nlated liquid crystalline domains. The mesogenic solvent can\nthen be coupled to an external field to directly simulate a\nDFN electro-optical switch. For some real DFN systems, the\nswitching behavior can be quite complex with different\nswitching regimes possible depending on the applied volt-\nage; which suggests rearrangement in the dendrimer struc-\nture as seen in the current study.\nFIG. 9.
