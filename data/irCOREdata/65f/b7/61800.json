The potential of entomopathogens as \nbiological control agents of pest insects is widely recognized but \ninformation on the role of pathogens in insect population regulation, \nmore generally, is limited.  For example, the role of pathogens as \nnatural enemies of non-pest insects, including those of conservation \nvalue, is seldom considered beyond their context as \u2018non-targets\u2019 of \nmicrobial control agents.  Entomopathogens are prevalent in natural \nsystems and should receive greater attention in life history studies.  \nThere is no doubt that viruses, bacteria and fungi are major \nmortality agents of insects but their significance tends to be \novershadowed by the attention given to predators and parasitoids.  \nWe highlight the critical function that entomopathogens could have \nin insect population dynamics with particular reference fragmented \nhabitats as illustrated by the theoretical literature.  However, we \nemphasize that there are few empirical studies to test theoretical \npredictions.  Furthermore, we suggest that since an increase in the \nincidence of disease is predicted in most environmental change \nscenarios, it is more important than ever to turn our attention to \ninsect pathology when we consider insect population dynamics.   \n \nThe fields of insect pathology and insect conservation have made \nconsiderable advances over the last few decades, but the two disciplines \nrarely meet.  The role of pathogens as natural enemies of insects \n(entomopathogens), including those of conservation value, is seldom \nconsidered (Roy and Cottrell, 2008).  Naturally occurring entomopathogens \nare diverse and widespread (Lacey et al., 2001);  50 % of living organisms \nare microbial (Watson et al., 1995) and insect pathogens are ubiquitous in \nboth above and below-ground ecosystems (Hajek, 2004).  However, most \nstudies on insect life history refer only to predators and parasitoids when \nconsidering natural enemy guilds.  It is possible that pathogens have been \n 2\nneglected in life history studies because of the technical difficulties involved in \nassessing host-pathogen relationships within a natural community context.  \nThe covert nature of some pathogen infections (Burden et al., 2003; Cooper \net al., 2003) has certainly contributed to an underestimate of their importance \n(Bonsall et al., 2005; Boots et al., 2003).  However, modern molecular \ntechniques are now available to enable the balance to be addressed. \n \nPathogen lifecycles \nAlthough entomopathogens are taxonomically diverse it is possible to make \nsome generalizations about their life cycles and these are important when \nconsidering their importance in host population dynamics (Roy et al., 2006).  \nViruses, bacteria and protists usually enter the host via oral routes whereas \nfungi invade through the cuticle (Steinhaus, 1964).  Once inside the living \nhost they proliferate and often then kill the insect when resources are \ndepleted, although some pathogens may persist as covert infections inside \nthe host.  The final stage of pathogen lifecycles results in the release of \ninfectious propagules for subsequent transmission.  \n \nPathogens and hosts are engaged in a coevolutionary arms race, adapting to \nmaximize their own reproductive output and ultimate fitness.  Pathogen \nfitness is defined as the basic reproductive rate (R0) \u2013 the number of new \ninfections generated by one original infection when invading a clean, \nsusceptible population.  Both transmission efficiency and survival within and \noutside the host are components of R0.  The host will be avoiding or resisting \nthe pathogen or optimizing survival after infection.  The strategies adopted to \nachieve this are almost as diverse as the organisms themselves and are \nmodulated by the biotic and abiotic environment in which these organisms \ncoexist and\/ or compete for resources (Roy et al., 2006).  Some pathogens \nhave wide host ranges with the potential to exploit many different hosts \nothers alternate between biotrophy and saprotrophy and some are host \nspecialists.  Entomophthoralean fungi are often extremely host specific, \ninfecting insects within a family, while hypocrealean fungi are more generalist \n 3\nin their host range, infecting taxonomically distinct orders of insects and \nfunctioning as facultative saprotrophs (Hajek et al., 2008). Baculoviruses are \na group of DNA viruses that occur widely, but not exclusively, in Lepidoptera, \nand have been developed as biopesticides in some instances (Szewczyk et al., \n2006). A few baculovirus species appear to be very host specific (e.g. Barber \net al 1993) but some such as Mamestra brassicae nucleopolyhedrovirus \n(MbNPV) and the closely related Panolis flammea nucleopolyhedrovirus \n(PaflNPV) have a relatively wide host range (Doyle et al 1990).  Indeed, it is \nthought that infection of different insect species plays an important role in the \nmaintenance of genetic diversity within virus populations (Hitchman et al., \n2007).  The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis as a species has a wide host \nrange but the diversity of crystal proteins (cry toxins) expressed by the \nbacterium ensures each strain, which carries a different cry toxin, is specific \noften to an insect order (De Maagd et al., 2001).  Pathogen host specificity is \na contentious issue and while the taxonomic status of many pathogens \nremains unresolved (Hibbert et al., 2007) it is difficult to interpret the \navailable literature.    \n \nMuch of the evidence for host range is laboratory based and such studies do \nnot consider the complexities of a heterogeneous environment (Samways, \n2005; Solter, 2006).  Potential hosts may be physiologically susceptible under \nlaboratory conditions but this may not translate to ecological susceptibility in \nthe field for a number of reasons (Roy and Pell, 2000; Solter, 2006). For \nexample, under field conditions, hosts may rarely become exposed to \nconcentrations of the pathogen sufficient to cause infection, or there may be \na lack of spatial or temporal synchrony between host and pathogen \npopulations.  Recent studies have contributed to our understanding of the \nintricate and often complex nature of insect-pathogen interactions but still \nmuch of the emphasis in this research area focuses on entomopathogens as \nbiological control agents.  There is a need for fundamental research to further \nour understanding of the evolution of life history strategies and the ecology of \ninsect-pathogen interactions in the natural environment.   \n 4\n Economic uses of insect pathogens  \nThe significance of insect pathogens in regulating economically important \ninsect populations has been recognized and exploited for centuries \n(Steinhaus, 1956).  The successful development of the bacterium B. \nthuringiensis as a control agent of insects marked the advent of modern \nmicrobial control (Lacey et al., 2001; Lord, 2005) and the discipline of insect \npathology.  The link between insect pathology and pest control has continued \nand a wealth of literature exists on entomopathogens as natural pest-insect \npopulation regulators that can be manipulated for enhanced impact in \nmicrobial control strategies (Evans, 1986; Lacey et al., 2001; Hajek et al., \n2007).  Landmark studies that exemplify this include those on gypsy moths, \nLymantria dispar, and the fungus Entomophaga maimaga (Reardon and \nHajek, 1993); pine beauty moth, Panolis flammea, and nucleopolyhedrosis \nviruses (Entwistle and Evans, 1987); cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii, and the \nfungus Neozygites fresenii (Steinkraus et al., 1995); palm rhinoceros beetle, \nOryctes rhinoceros, and a non-occluded virus (Bedford, 1980); the bacterium \nB. thuringiensis and European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Beegle and \nYamamoto, 1992), L. dispar (Burges and Daoust, 1986), vector blackflies and \nmosquitoes (Lacey and Undeen, 1986) and stored-product pest, Plodia \ninterpunctella (McGaughey, 1986) and the development of genetically \nmodified baculovriuses (Cory 2000, Hails 2001, Hails et al. 2002).  These \nstudies on pest insects highlight the potential of entomopathogens to regulate \npopulations, but pathogens are rarely included as natural enemies in studies \non non-pest insect species.  By definition non-pest insects are often at lower \ndensities than insects designated pest status and this could impede horizontal \ntransmission making highly visible virulent epizootics a rare event.   \n \nEffects of pathogens on non-target organisms \nHistorically insect pathogens have been noted as potentially important in the \nregulation of non-pest insects (Perrin, 1976; Dwyer, 1991; Myers, 2000; \nLacey et al., 2001) but even the first experimental studies in 1835 focused \n 5\nexclusively on economically important insects namely honey bees, silk moths \nand pest insects (Steinhaus, 1975; Howarth, 2001).  This legacy has \ncontinued and prevalence of pathogens in non-pest insects is generally \nconsidered only when the insects are designated \u2018non-target\u2019 hosts of a \ngeneralist entomopathogen that is under development as a microbial control \nagent.  These non-target insects are restricted to particular taxonomic groups \nsuch as honey bees, predators, parasitoids or insects closely related to the \ntarget pest insect often within ecosystems already perturbed through \nagriculture or forestry (Hajek et al., 2007; Thomas and Blanford, 2003).   \n \nImportance of pathogens in natural systems \nOur understanding of host-pathogen interactions from a pest management \nperspective, although often limited by scale, does have great relevance when \nwe consider the potential importance of pathogens in populations of non-pest \ninsects of conservation importance in natural and semi-natural ecosystems;  \nfor which there is currently very little information. Bierne (1955) \ncomprehensively reviewed the causes of natural fluctuations in abundance of \nBritish Lepidoptera and recognized the importance of fungal diseases \nparticularly in wet summers.  There are further examples of insect \npopulations cycling from low to high density where pathogens are implicated \nin declines from high density.  For example, epizootics of the fungal pathogen \nPandora neoaphidis in nettle aphids, Microlophium carnosum (Perrin, 1976); \ntransmission dynamics of the nucleopolyhedrosis virus of douglas-fir tussock \nmoth, Orgyia pseudotsugata (Dwyer, 1991); population fluctuations of \nwestern tent caterpillars, Malacosoma californicum pluviale, attributed to \nnucleopolyhedrosis virus (Myers, 2000).  In a more recent study Graham et \nal. (2004) assessed the prevalence of a nucleopolyhedrovirus in spatially \nseparated populations of the winter moth Operophtera brumata in Orkney.  \nVirus was found in 11 of the 13 winter moth populations sampled.  In two of \nthese winter moth populations more than 50 percent mortality was attributed \nto viral infection.  Furthermore, three previously undescribed reoviruses were \nfound, with prevalence ranging from 0-50% and presence correlating with \n 6\nreduced host fecundity (Graham et al 2006). The authors concluded that the \nhigh prevalence of disease, and particularly covert disease, in these natural \nlepidopteran host populations should encourage further studies into the role \nof pathogens in the regulation of host insect populations. We agree with this \nview but further suggest careful consideration should be given to rare species \nand common species that, with environmental change (such as habitat \nfragmentation and climate change), are suffering continuing population \ndeclines.   \n \nEffects of pathogens on rare species \nMost organisms are host to specialist and generalist microbial natural enemies \nbut it is important to ascertain whether these diseases are of conservation \nconcern for our rare species (Lafferty and Gerber, 2002). The transmission of \nan infectious disease agent through any population will increase with the \ndensity of susceptible and infectious hosts (Anderson and May, 1986).  \nHowever, some species are nationally scarce but locally abundant and \ntransmission between hosts could be facilitated by local aggregations.  Simple \nepidemiological models indicate that there will be densities at which a host \npopulation is too low for invasion by a pathogen which relies solely on \nhorizontal transmission, signifying that rare or significantly depleted \npopulations should be at minimal risk from their microbial natural enemies.  \nHorizontal transmission is usually strongly density-dependent and so \npathogens are unlikely to result in host extinction, particularly if hosts are \nrare.  Indeed highly pathogenic organisms that rapidly kill their hosts will tend \nto extinction themselves (burn out) if transmission to new hosts at low \ndensities is insufficient to maintain Ro above 1 (Anderson, 1979).  \nEpidemiological theory would therefore suggest that infectious diseases which \nrely wholly on horizontal transmission are irrelevant to conservation biology \nwhen species are rare and subsequently at low population densities for much \nof the time.  This conclusion relies on a number of assumptions which may be \ncontravened. Three examples are given below. \n \n 7\nUntil recently it was assumed that the transmission of baculoviruses between \nhosts was primarily horizontal, resulting in overt and lethal infection. \nHowever, there are now several studies which have revealed a degree of \nvertical transmission of these viruses, with either imperceptible or sublethal \neffects on host fitness (Hughes et al 1993, 1997, Burden et al 2002, 2003, \nGraham et al 2004). Furthermore, the evidence suggests that these persistent \ninfections do retain the ability to revert to the overt lethal state (Cooper et al \n2003, Burden et al 2006). Theoretical models illustrate that for a wide range \nof conditions, covert infections may become endemic in the host population, \nto the exclusion of clean, uninfected hosts (Bonsall et al 2005). Vertical \ntransmission does not rely on host densities being above a critical threshold \nand therefore persistent, covert infections represent a mechanism by which \npotentially lethal disease may persist in a declining population. Vertical \ntransmission is also widely reported for bacteria and microsporidia and is \npotentially an important mechanism for persistence within the life cycle of \nthese groups (Solter, 2006).  However, the emphasis for experimental work \nhas been from the perspective of biological control or medical importance and \nthis has limited the range of host orders and pathogens evaluated.  This \nmode of transmission is almost certainly important for far more pathogen \nspecies than is currently known.   \n \nOur second example challenges our knowledge of the host range of many \npathogens. We suggest that many pathogens are thought to be host specific \nbecause they have not been looked for beyond the host from which they were \noriginally isolated. In particular, covert infections in \u2018unexpected\u2019 hosts are \nlikely to go undetected. In O. brumata populations in which three novel \nreoviruses were detected, it was subsequently discovered that two other \nmembers of the heather feeding community, the Grey Mountain Carpet, \nEntephria caesiata, and the July highflyer, Hydriomena furcata, were also \ncarriers (Graham 2005, Graham et al 2006). Pathogens with a wider host \nrange can exploit alternative (reservoir) hosts, and once again this decouples \nthe reliance of the pathogen on the density of any one particular host species.  \n 8\n Thirdly, persistent infective stages may allow pathogens to ride out periods of \nlow host density, theoretically even to the point of causing host extinction. \nThe soil represents a very stable environment which allows some pathogens \nto persist in an infectious state for many years.  Organisms that spend \nperiods of their life-cycle in those environments can be at risk even when they \nare at low population densities.  For example, baculoviruses and fungi (both \nhypocrealean and entomophthoralean) can persist in the soil where they may \ninfect late stage larvae or pupae of Lepidoptera which descend to the soil to \npupate (Roy et al., 2006; Raymond et al., 2005; Meyling and Pell, 2006;).   \n \nWe conclude, for all the reasons discussed above, that the impact of \npathogens, even those thought to be primarily horizontally transmitted, may \nbe greater than has been formally recognized to date. \n \nEffects of environmental change on epidemiology \nHaving considered the potential role of pathogens in the natural regulation or \neven extinction of rare species we now consider how this may be affected \ndirectly and indirectly by anthropogenically-induced global environmental \nchange, including climate change and habitat fragmentation, which is \nbecoming increasingly implicated in the decline of populations (Balmford et al, \n2005).  It is anticipated that infectious diseases in general will increase in \nprevalence in temperate zones where the climate is predicted to become \nwarmer and wetter (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 1996; \nMillenium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005).  Infectious diseases and pathogens \nthat have previously had negligible impact on insect populations could have \ndramatic consequences in the future because of climate change and also \nhabitat destruction.   \n \nEffects of climate change \nEven modest changes to the climate are expected to have a rapid impact on \nthe distribution and abundance of pest insects and their associated pathogens \n 9\nbecause they are physiologically sensitive to temperature and have short life \ncycles, high mobility and high reproductive potential (Ayres and Lombardero, \n2000).  Many non-pest insects are already responding rapidly to climate \nchange (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003) and expanding northwards (Asher et al., \n2001; Hickling et al. 2006).  There is currently no information on comparable \nbroad-scale changes in the dynamics of pathogen populations.   \n \nIt has been recognized for many years that temperature affects biochemical, \nphysiological and behavioural processes in insects and pathogens (Thomas \nand Blanford, 2003).  There are many studies demonstrating temperature \noptima of insects and pathogens (Carruthers et al., 1992; Kobayashi et al., \n1981; Watson et al., 1993).  Recent research has shown that temperature can \nalso have a crucial role in mediating the outcome of host-pathogen \ninteractions (Thomas and Blanford, 2003).  For example, thermal effects have \nbeen demonstrated for insect pathogenic fungi (Caruthers et al., 1992; \nWatson et al., 1993), viruses (Kobayashi et al., 1981) and microsporidia \n(Campbell et al., 2007).  Temperature can affect host-pathogen dynamics in a \nvariety of ways such as: alterations to the latent period of infection (Blanford \nand Thomas, 1999), host recovery and pathogen mortality (Roy et al., 2006), \npathogen and host replication (Kobayashi et al., 1981), pathogen virulence \nand host resistance (Blanford and Thomas, 1999; Arthurs and Thomas, 2000; \nStacey et al., 2003).  Insects (and their pathogens) are likely to track ambient \ntemperature (thermoconforming) and are likely to be more vulnerable to \nchanges in temperature for example as a consequence of global warming.  \nHowever, effects of environmental temperature change on host-pathogen \ninteractions will be varied because pathogen and host traits will have different \nthermal optima (Thomas and Blanford, 2003).   \n \nIt is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of host-pathogen interactions in \nresponse to climate change because of the complexity of the interactions and \nlack of available data.  It is common for the performance of insect pathogens \nused as biological control agents in the field to be highly erratic (Blanford and \n 10\nThomas, 1999; Thomas and Blandford, 2003).  This variability is also evident \nin natural systems whereby in some years a pathogen can reach epizootic \nproportions and in other years hosts remain uninfected.  Temperature can \naffect both host susceptibility and (or) pathogen virulence (where virulence is \ndefined as the net effect of the host-pathogen interaction on host fitness) and \nconsequently influence disease dynamics, however, responses can vary from \npositive or negative linear responses to more complex relationships (Blanford \nand Thomas, 1999; Blanford and Thomas, 2000;Thomas and Blanford, 2003).  \nFor example, the entomophthoralean fungus Entomophaga grylli can be a \nmajor mortality factor of the variegated grasshopper Zonocerus variegatus \n(Chapman and Page, 1979).  However, an increase in environmental \ntemperature of 2 \u00b0C enables infected individuals to recover from the pathogen \nby raising body temperature through behaviour such as basking (Blanford et \nal., 2000).  In contrast, insect viruses generally exhibit low virulence at cool \ntemperatures and increase in virulence with increasing in temperature \neventually reaching an asymptote as temperature rises further (Johnson et \nal., 1982).  Not all insects are behavioural thermoregulators but it should not \nbe assumed that thermoconforming insects lack thermal sensitivity; \nenvironmentally driven variation in host body temperature will also influence \nhost defence mechanisms such as the innate immune system, host density \nand melanin production (Thomas and Blanford, 2003; Stacey et al., 2003).   \n \nSeveral Entomophthoralean fungi exhibit an adaptive diurnal pattern of host \ndeath (Neilson and Hajek, 2006; Roy et al., 2006); host death occurs in the \nlate afternoon or early evening and the fungus releases infective conidia \nduring the night when relative humidity is high.  This diurnal pattern benefits \ntransmission of the fungus between hosts.  The precision of synchrony, of \nhost death with environmental conditions favouring fungal transmission, is \nassociated with the climatic region in which the pathogen evolved (Milner et \nal., 1984).  So fungal species with a precise timing of death and a short \nsporulation time appear to be adapted to continental weather conditions with \ncycles of dry and moist conditions during the day and night (Milner et al., \n 11\n1984).  In contrast, fungal species displaying weak diurnal rhythm in mortality \nwith prolonged periods of sporulation seem adapted to cool, moist climates \nwith less diurnal fluctuation in temperature and humidity (Milner et al., 1984).  \nThe Entomophthoralean fungus Entomophaga maimaiga infects Lymantria \ndispar (gypsy moth) larvae and sporulation is synchronised with a diurnal \nrhythm (Neilson and Hajek, 2006).  An empirical study on this host-pathogen \nsystem demonstrated that by raising the temperature from 15 to 20 \u00b0C the \npeak death time narrowed and sporulation was initiated earlier at night.  \nFurthermore, alterations to abiotic conditions will differentially influence \npathogen (and host) species of different genotypes.  For example, Bidochka \net al. (2002) demonstrated that the habitat from which the isolate was \nderived drives the population structure of the fungus B. bassiana.  Isolates \n(genotypes) of the fungal species B. bassiana from artic and forested habitats \ngrew at lower temperatures than those isolates from agricultural habitats \nwhich grew at temperatures in excess of 37 \u00b0C (Bidochka et al., 2002).      \n   \n \nIn summary, the life history traits of insect hosts and their pathogens are \nstrongly influenced by temperature (and other abiotic conditions) and the \nprecise outcome of an interaction will depend on the relevant environmental \nrange of the genotypes of host and pathogen and the prevailing conditions.  \nSpatial and temporal variation in host-pathogen dynamics is commonly \nobserved and a minimal change in temperature could alter the outcome of the \ninteraction dramatically.  There is considerable need for more studies \nexamining insect host-pathogen systems under a range of constant and \nfluctuating temperatures.   \n \n Effects of habitat destruction \nTheories on the dynamics of pathogens in fragmented habitats have been \nbased on the metapopulation paradigm whereby, as patches become smaller \nand more separated, rates of extinction increase and rates of recolonisation \ndecrease (Hanski, 1997).  It is also assumed that the remaining habitat is \n 12\nlikely to be degraded as a consequence of high demand on the reduced \nresources and, therefore, individuals residing in these habitats could be \nabnormally stressed resulting in increased susceptibility to disease (Lafferty \nand Gerber, 2002).  Reduced population size would increase the incidence of \ninbreeding which could promote a long-term loss in genetic diversity and \nhence reduced potential to adapt to infectious diseases (Lyles and Dobson, \n1993).  The risk of microbial control agents spreading from the site of \napplication into environmentally sensitive areas will be increased in \nfragmented habitats because of greater edge effects (Lafferty and Gerber, \n2002).  It appears that environmental change has the potential to affect \nepidemiology but these predictions need to be tested experimentally, on \ninsect-pathogen systems, to gain an accurate measure of the overall impact.  \nCurrently such studies are lacking.   \n \nThe spatial dynamics of pathogens have been extensively studied (Ostfeld et \nal., 2005) but not at the landscape level.  Mechanisms of pathogen dispersal \nfrom an infected to an uninfected host are extremely varied ranging from \ndirect contact (sexual diseases) and near-direct contact (pathogens released \nand then inhaled or ingested) to indirect contact via a vector (Ostfeld et al., \n2005).  In all cases the probability of pathogen transmission decreases with \nincreasing distance between susceptible hosts (except in the case of vertical \ntransmission, when hosts may carry the seeds of their own destruction).  So \nfactors influencing the spatial distribution of pathogens, host and vectors are \nfundamental to disease dynamics.  Work on viruses has highlighted the \nimportance of spatial structure on pathogen survival and transmission.  \nHabitat can influence the persistence of pathogens in the field; baculovirus in \nforested (sitka spruce and oak) areas retained infectivity longer than in an \nunshaded (heather) habitat (Raymond et al., 2005).  The spatial scale of most \nhost-pathogen studies is often at the field level or less.  Few empirical studies \nincorporate a landscape approach (Barta and Cagan, 2003).  Consideration of \nthe heterogeneous nature of the environment, embracing the challenges of \n 13\nthe landscape scale, in which pathogens and hosts coexist will be important in \nunderstanding how these systems will respond as the environment changes.   \n \nCorridors connecting remnant habitat patches are regarded as a conservation \nstrategy (McCallum and Dobson, 2002).  However, Hess (1996) developed a \nmodel, based on the classical Levins (1969) metapopulation structure, for \npathogens in fragmented habitats which led to the conclusion that movement \nof individuals among populations is risky.  However, McCallum and Dobson \n(2002) challenged this conclusion, recognizing that not all pathogens are host \nspecific and that a second host species may act as a pathogen reservoir.  \nThey extended the simplified model by Hess (1996) to examine cases where \nthe pathogen infects both a rare host and a common reservoir species \n(McCallum and Dobson, 2002).  From this revised model it was concluded that \nhabitat loss will cause extinction of the pathogen before loss of the host and, \nfurthermore, while the pathogen may spread through corridors between \nhabitat patches, the benefit of permitting recolonisation of vacant patches by \nthe host counterbalances the cost of disease spread (McCallum and Dobson, \n2002).  In both the Hess and the McCallum and Dobson models, the \npathogens were directly transmitted between hosts. Many entomopathogens \nare indirectly transmitted, but do form persistent reservoirs external to the \nhost as well as in alternative host species. Consequently the latter model is \nthe most applicable, and increasing connectance between habitat fragments \nis likely to be beneficial for rare species.  \n \nThe spatial complexity of population structure is an inherent component of \nsource-sink metapopulation and metacommunity models (Hanski and Gilpin, \n1991; Hanski and Simberloff, 1997; Namba et al., 1999; Rodriguez and \nTorres-Sorando, 2001).  These models have demonstrated that habitat \npartitioning can promote coexistence of prey by relaxing apparent competition \nmediated by a shared predator (Holt, 1984) but could also result in extinction \nof the predator species (if prey productivity in a source population is \ninsufficient to \u201crescue\u201d a deficient sink population) or the prey species (if the \n 14\nsource is too rich giving rise to shared predation) (Namba et al., 1999).  The \nnumber of sinks and spatial arrangement and connectivity between patches \ndifferentially influence persistence of populations in different trophic levels \n(Namba et al., 1999).  The probability of establishment of a pathogen within a \nhost patch is predicted to decrease with increasing spatial partitioning \n(fragmentation) and with decreasing host movement between patches \n(Rodriguez and Torres-Sorando, 2001).  These models examine the role of \ntrophic and spatial complexity on population persistence but there is little \nempirical evidence to support the model predictions.  We believe that \npathogens and their hosts could be exemplary systems for empirically testing \ntheoretical models based on metacommunity structure.       \n \nIn a recent empirical study Tscharntke et al. (2002) examined the interactions \nbetween insects (grassland butterflies, legume and rape feeding herbivores \nand their parasitoids) in a fragmented landscape.  Habitat fragmentation \ndifferentially affected the interactions between species with varying \ncommunity structure.  Habitat fragmentation was more detrimental to \nspecialised butterflies than less specialized oligophagous and polyphagous \nherbivores (Tscharntke et al., 2002).  Species richness and abundance of \npolyphagous butterfly species was higher in small rather than large calcareous \nfragments and illustrates the importance of the landscape matrix within which \nthe patches are embedded for less specialized species.  Therefore, Tscharntke \net al. (2002) conclude that an intermediate fragmentation conservation \nstrategy (combining the advantages of both several small and single large \nfragment structures) could be beneficial in a human-dominated landscape.  \nFurther empirical studies are urgently needed to underpin the theoretical \ndevelopments in this area.  Briggs et al. (1995) stated that the extent to \nwhich pathogen dynamics will drive, rather than be driven by, the dynamics \nof their host is an important and open question in many natural systems.  \nThis is still a fundamental question today and understanding the role of \npathogens in regulating host populations in fragmented habitats appears \nparticularly challenging.    \n 15\n Future perspectives  \nConservation biology and the development of practical approaches to the \nprevention of species declines and extinctions are dependent on the \nintegration of theories and disciplines.  There is no doubt that in most studies \non insect conservation the roles of insect pathogens largely go unnoticed.  \nPathogens may not drive a host to extinction but they may result in \npopulation depletion to such a low density that other factors become \nimportant such as Alee effects or random stochastic events (Lafferty and \nGerber, 2002).  As discussed some species are nationally scarce but locally \nabundant and transmission between hosts could be facilitated by local \naggregations. Further research on spatial epidemiology of insect pathogens is \nrequired if we are to make realistic predictions of the impact of environmental \nchange on host-pathogen dynamics.   \n \nThere is currently much debate regarding the influence that a single mortality \nagent such as a pathogen can have on host regulation (Graham et al., 2004).  \nHost-pathogen relationships are complex and can be extremely subtle often \nvarying both spatially and temporally; pathogen density within a host \npopulation is often underestimated because the pathogen remains undetected \nin symptomless individuals (Graham et al., 2004) or studies are not of \nsufficient spatial or temporal scale to capture the role of pathogens on life \nhistory traits. \n \nWe urgently need to apply, more widely, the wealth of molecular techniques \navailable to document the diversity and prevalence of pathogens, in all their \nguises, within non-pest insect populations.  Only then can we confidently \ncomment on the current role of insect pathogens in population regulation and \non the impact of future environmental regimes on host-pathogen interactions.  \nInsect pathology has never been more relevant than in the current period of \nrapid environmental change.  \n \n 16\nAcknowledgements: \nHER, HH, RSH were funded by the Environmental Change Integrating Fund \nthrough the NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
