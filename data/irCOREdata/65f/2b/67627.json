Hackett \nSouthwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas \nAbstract. Variability in the high latitude electric field has \nbeen identified as a major contributor to global Joule heat- \ning. Electric field patterns from the Assimilative Mapping of \nIonospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure are used to \ncharacterize the E-field temporal variability over the course \nof 18 hours. The standard deviation of the E-field magnitude \non May 4, 1998 often exceeds the average value of the E-field \nmagnitude. A significant fraction of this variability arises \nfrom oscillations with period less than one hour. This con- \nfirms that Joule heating calculations based on time-averaged \nE-fields may significantly under-predict the heating. \nIntroduction \nThe electric field is one of the most important electro- \ndynamic quantities that determine the coupled behavior \nof the high latitude ionosphere and thermosphere (I-T). \nKnowledge of the electric field is required to specify iono- \nspheric transport, the ion-drag force on the neutral gas, and \nfrictional heating of the ion and neutral gases. The ion drag \nforce leads to the momentum forcing of the neutral gas and \nthe setting up of global wind patterns. The frictional heat- \ning (Joule heating) drives horizontal and vertical winds, and \nleads to changes in the global temperature and composi- \ntional structure of the thermosphere, with resulting changes \nin ionospheric electron density [Crowley, 1991; Irareel et al., \n2000]. \nHistorically, the effect of the magnetosphere on the I- \nT system, and of the I-T system on the magnetosphere has \nbeen taken into account by the use of electric field climatolo- \ngies constructed from an ensemble of many days of obser- \nvations [e.g. Foster et al., 1986; Weimer, 1996]. However, \nthese simple boundary conditions are now restricting our \nunderstanding, and we need to better understand the ITM \ncoupling. One of the critical factors involved in understand- \ning the coupling is to determine the temporal and spatial \nscales over which the ionospheric electric field varies. \nAt the largest spatial scale sizes (200 - 2000 km), the \nionospheric convection pattern is controlled mainly by the \nIMF. The existence of 2, 3 and 4-cell patterns under vari- \nous IMF conditions is well established [Crowley et al., 1992; \nGreenwald et al., 1995]. However, the IMF is extremely vari- \nable, and the corresponding temporal and spatial changes of \nthe large-scale patterns are not well characterized. Tempo- \nral variability could be responsible for a large fraction of the \nJoule heating experienced by the atmosphere [Codrescu et \nal., (1995)], and this heating is not captured by GCMs when \nCopyright 2001 by the American Geophysical Union. \nPaper number 2000GL012624. \n0094-8276\/01\/2000GL012624505.00 \ndriven by climatological E-field models. [Codrescu et al., \n[1997] demonstrated the effect by arbitrarily adding vari- \nability to the E-field specification in their global model. \nFoster et al., [1986] constructed a climatological E-field \nmodel using Millstone Hill radar data. Recently, Codrescu et \nal., [2000] re-analyzed the Millstone Hill data obtained from \n1979-1986 between 48 \u00f8 and 78 \u00f8 North magnetic latitude to \nobtain an estimate of the corresponding standard deviations. \nThe line-of- sight measurements were binned as a function \nof magnetic local time (1-hr), magnetic latitude (2\u00f8), auro- \nral activity (Hp Index) and season. The standard deviation \ngenerally increased from lower to higher latitudes, reaching \na maximum near the sunward-to-antisunward flow reversal, \nbefore decreasing into the polar cap. For quiet conditions, \nstandard deviations exceeded 400 m\/s in a 10 \u00f8 latitude band \nin the midnight sector, reducing to a 5 \u00f8 band on the dayside. \nFor active conditions, the convection pattern expanded, and \na significant fraction of the high latitude region experienced \nmore than 200 m\/s standard deviations. Assuming a Gaus- \nsian distribution of variability around the mean E-field, they \nshowed that the mean E-field and standard deviation have \nequal weights in Joule heating generation. Thus, they as- \nsert the mean square E-field magnitude is roughly double \nthe square of the mean E-field magnitude. This argument \nprovides a justification of the ad-hoc doubling or tripling of \nJoule heating applied in many GCM's. \nThe Codrescu et al., [2000] study represents a major step \nforward in quantifying the variability of the electric field. \nHowever, the uniqueness of the variability obtained from \nthat work, and the manner in which it should be applied \nare unclear. For example, the Codrescu et al., [2000] study \nwas limited to line of sight drift measurements from one \nlocation gathered over a period of many years. The ensem- \nble standard deviation they compute is thus not necessarily \nrepresentative of the standard deviation that would be ob- \nserved over a period of one day or one hour. The present \npaper introduces a new technique for obtaining statistical \ninformation on the electric field. It explores whether the \nensemble standard deviation is an appropriate number, and \nwhat the standard deviation over an interval of about 1- \nday would be if one could continuously measure the E-field \nat each location. It also examines what percentage of the \nvariation comes from high and low frequencies. \nMethod \nOur lack of knowledge about the temporal and spatial \nvariability of the electric field and conductance is partly due \nto the difficulty of measuring these parameters everywhere \nsimultaneously. Ideally, all of the electrodynamic parame- \nters would be routinely measured at high resolution through- \nout the high latitude region. In reality, what is available is a \n2783 \n2784 CROWLEY & HACKERT: QUANTIFICATION OF HIGH LATITUDE ELECTRIC FIELD VARIABILITY \nMLT: 12. MLAT: 76.

Time history and power spectrum of AMIE electric \nfield magnitude at two grid locations for May 4, 1998. \nsparse collection of single-point measurements irregularly lo- \ncated in time and space. The Assimilative Mapping of Iono- \nspheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure is an inversion \ntechnique that can ingest data from a wide range of sources \nto produce a realistic representation of the high latitude elec- \ntrodynamic state for a given time [Richmond, 1992]. The \ndata inputs typically include electric fields derived from ion \nvelocities measured by radars, satellites, and digital ionoson- \ndes, together with magnetic perturbations from ground and \nspace based instruments. Particle precipitation data from \nsatellites and auroral images have also been used to provide \nionospheric onductance inputs for AMIE [e.g. Crowley et \nal., 2001]. Using these data, the distribution of various elec- \ntrodynamic parameters, including the electric field, can be \nderived through the electrodynamic equations. \nThis paper demonstrates how the AMIE output fields \nprovide a basis for quantifying the temporal and spatial vari- \nability in the E-field for all MLT and magnetic latitude bins \nsimultaneously and continuously. The present study was \nundertaken to evaluate the temporal variability of the elec- \ntric field and conductance in the AMIE fields for a single \nday. The spatial variability will be the subject of a later pa- \nper. The AMIE electric fields used for this study were taken \nfrom work by Crowley et al., [2001], which discusses the sen- \nsitivity of the AMIE procedure to various input data sets. \nThe investigation was based on the 4th May (Day 124) 1998 \nstorm. The present paper is restricted to the 0600-2400 UT \nperiod after the main phase of the storm because POLAR \nUVI conductance data are only available from 0830- 1830 \nUT. The AMIE run also continuously ingested other data, \nincluding magnetic field data from 80 magnetometers, and \nE-fields and conductances derived from 3 D MSP satellites. \nThe SuperDARN radar E-field data from this period were \nvery sparse, and were not included in the run. \nResults \nAMIE provided electric field values at 10-minute time in- \ntervals, with a spatial resolution of 2 \u00f8 magnetic latitude and \n1-hr MLT. The temporal variability of the electric field was \ncharacterized by computing the mean values and variances \nfrom the mean at every grid point. This temporal variability \nwas further characterized by taking the Fourier transform in \ntime of the electric field magnitude at each spatial location. \nOn this particular day, the electric field was most active on \nthe day side, and Figure la shows the time history of the E- \nfield magnitude for 12 MLT and 76 \u00f8 MLAT, along with the \ncorresponding power spectrum in Figure lb. The nightside \nvalues and variability were relatively small, as characterized \nby Figures lc and ld for 00 MLT and 76 \u00f8 MLAT. Figure \n2 shows a sample of the large dayside highlatitude E-fields, \nand demonstrates the good agreement between the absolute \nvalue of AMIE generated E-fields and the corresponding val- \nues measured along the DMSP satellite orbit. \nThrough processing of the power spectrum, the total vari- \nance was divided into a high frequency part (periods less \nthan one hour), and a low frequency part (periods more than \none hour). Figure 3a depicts the average E-field magnitude \nas a function of MLT and magnetic latitude. (The outer \nlatitude circle is at 50 \u00f8 ). Figure 3b shows the RMS E-field \ndistribution, and figure 3c illustrates the standard devia- \ntion. These quantities are related by < E 2 >=< E >2 +or 2, \nand Codrescu et al., [1995] argue that < E 2 > is the proper \nterm to use in Joule heating calculations. Here, brackets \n<> denote average over time. \nFigure 3 confirms that ERMS is often significantly larger \nthan the mean E-field, and that the use of the mean E-field \nin global models will lead to an underestimate of thermo- \nspheric Joule heating. However, unlike the Codrescu et al., \n[2000] study, which found them to be of equal importance, \nwe find that the standard deviation can also be smaller than \nthe mean field. Figure 3d depicts the standard deviation as \na percentage of the mean E-field, and the standard deviation \npoleward of 70\u00f8N is generally less than 80% (and frequently \nonly 30%) of the mean E-field. On the dayside, equator- \nward of 70 \u00f8 , where the mean E-fields are smaller, the per- \ncentage increase contributed by variability ranges from 80% \nto 140%. Figures 3e and 3f are derived from the Fourier \ntransform in time of the E-field, and show the standard de- \nviation contributed by periods greater than 1-hour and less \nthan 1-hour, respectively. The contribution from the longer \nperiod variations (le) is about half that from the shorter \nperiod (lf) variations for this day. \n, , , \nFL\u2022. \n05\/04\/1998, IEI, AMIE rs.

The lack of data in \ncertain sectors for ingestion into AMIE presents a perennial \nproblem for obtaining realistic high latitude fields, and in \nthose sectors AMIE is generally forced to rely on statistical \nmodels. For the present case, the problem is mitigated by \nthe inclusion of conductances and E-fields from the three \nDMSP satellites, and conductances derived from the PO- \nLAR\/UVI instrument. Ideally, more data would be avail- \nable, including E-field measurements from the SuperDARN \nand Sondrestrom radars, but the present data set illustrates \nthe technique. \nIt is also important to note that the background patterns \nwere not static, but were themselves driven by external data. \nIn this study, the background patterns were Weimer [1996] \npatterns driven by ACE measurements of the IMF with a \n10-minute cadence. To ensure that the analysis presented \nin Figure 3 is not simply providing an estimate of the vari- \nability in the Weimer model, we applied the same Fourier \nanalysis to the Weimer background patterns driven only by \nthe IMF (i.e. no magnetometer, or other data ingested by \nAMIE). The results are shown in Figure 4, and reveal that \nthe mean E-field distribution (Fig 4a) is somewhat different \nfrom that shown in Figure 3a. Similarly, the variability as re- \nvealed by the distribution of the standard deviation (Fig 4c) \nis also different from that obtained using the AMIE patterns \nin Figure 3c. Comparison of Figures 4e and 4f indicates that \nFigure 3. Statistical analysis of fields driven by all available \ndata for May 4, 1998.

Figure 3e \nindicates the variability that would be added if the electric \nfield were changed with a cadence of about an hour. Figure \n3f indicates the additional variability from changing the E- \nfield with a 10- minute cadence. On this particular day the \nhigh frequency (< 1 hour) part of the variance contributes \nup to 80% of the overall variability of the E-field in the \npolar cap. The gentle slope of the spectrum in Figure lb \nindicates that there may also be significant variations at \nhigher frequencies that are not captured by the 10-minute \ncadence. \nThe quality of the AMIE patterns depends on the amount \nand quality of the data used to feed the assimilation. If the \nAMIE input data covered the entire high latitude region, \nthen the fitted coefficients and corresponding mapped func- \ntions such as the electric potential would be constrained in \nall locations. On the other hand, if there are no data in large \nregions of the high latitude ionosphere, the fitted coefficients \nare not constrained (in those regions), and the mapped func- \ntion may contain large uncertainties. In the data inversion, \na model is generally used to provide background information \nat particular locations. The background models are statisti- \ncal in nature and help to specify the inversion in regions of \nthe ionosphere where there is little or no input data. For ex- \n(o) evg.

Same as Figure 3, but for background model driven \nonly by IMF data. \nCROWLEY & HACKERT: QUANTIFICATION OF HIGH LATITUDE ELECTRIC FIELD VARIABILITY \nthe variability in the background patterns is similar on time \nscales of greater than 1-hour and less than 1-hour. The vari- \nability in the short period component increases when data \nare ingested into AMIE. This control study using only the \nWeimer patterns suggests the variability found in Figure 3 \nis probably a real geophysical effect, although the variability \nmight be underestimated. \nConclusions \nWe have demonstrated the potential for using the time- \nresolved electric fields from AMIE to characterize the high- \nlatitude E-field temporal variability. For a particular 18- \nhour interval, the standard deviation was comparable with \nthe mean value of the high latitude E-field. Therefore, Joule \nheating calculations based on time-averaged E-fields will sig- \nnificantly under-predict the heating. There are significant \ndifferences between these AMIE results and the ensemble \nstandard deviation of the Codrescu et al. [2000] results. \nCodrescu et al. were unable to examine the polar cap in \ndetail, but suggested that the greatest variability occurs in \nan annulus corresponding to the auroral oval. In contrast, \nthe AMIE results (Figure 3c) show peak variability in the \ncusp and polar cap, with standard deviations reaching 20 \nmV\/m (equivalent to 400 m\/s ion velocity) which are com- \nparable with the auroral standard deviations obtained by \nCodrescu et al. [2000]. The data set used by Codrescu et al. \n[2000] did not permit an examination of temporal variabil- \nity in different frequency ranges. Most of the variability in \nour data-driven AMIE patterns arose from variations with \nperiods of less than one hour. In spite of gaps in the spa- \ntial coverage of the AMIE input data-sets, we showed in a \ncontrol-experiment that the observed E-field variability is a \nfunction of actual measurements and not simply the back- \nground Weimer [1996] pattern driven by the IMF. \nThis work has demonstrated the principle of using AMIE \nto study temporal E-field variability, but it generates more \nquestions than it answers. Since this data is from a period \nfollowing the main phase of a storm, the results may not \nbe typical, and in future a much larger statistical study in- \nvolving other intervals will be performed. The present study \ncontained a relatively small amount of E-field data, and it \nwill be particularly interesting to investigate intervals for \nwhich there are large quantities of radar E-field measure- \nments. Because of the AMIE data-fitting procedure, the \nAMIE results will always be less variable than the data, and \nwill lead to an underestimate of the temporal and spatial \nvariability of the E-field. This smoothing effect is visible \nin Figure 2. In a future investigation, the variability spec- \ntrum for a faster cadence, such as every 1-minute, will be \nexamined. Since the AMIE technique also produces global \nconductance patterns, this technique will be extended to an- \nalyze the conductance and Joule heating variability directly. \nThe AMIE fields will also permit investigation of the spatial \nvariability. \nIn principle, studies of this kind provide a factor with \nwhich to correct the average E-field models and Joule heat- \ning when they are used in global I-T models. However, the \nvariability is not uniformly distributed around the high lat- \nitude regions, and therefore uniformly applying a correction \nfactor is inappropriate. For most applications, including \nspace weather, the variability of the electric field and its ef- \nfect on Joule heating in the numerical I-T models would be \nbetter specified by using realistic convection patterns (such \nas those from AMIE) instead of fixed average convection \nmodels. \nAcknowledgments.
