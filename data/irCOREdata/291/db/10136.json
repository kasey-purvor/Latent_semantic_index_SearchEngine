Infant Mental Health Journal, 16: 271\u201391. Commentary by Monica Lanyado, child and adolescent psychotherapist and training supervisor at the British Association of Psychotherapists The issues that Jackie and her therapist are working with in this session will be familiar to all therapists working with children who are \u2018in transition\u2019. Jackie is an 8-year-old child who has a \u2018short-term\u2019 foster carer that she has been with for 2 years and regular supervised contact with members of her birth family. She needs a permanent home that the professionals responsible for her care are trying to \ufb01nd, without much success. We gather that there is a lot of anxiety in the network about this. The therapist seems to feel that he or she can do little to ensure that the move to a more permanent placement happens in a measured way. There is an anxiety that the move will be precipitate and create further traumatic loss in Jackie\u2019s life. There is also a fear that there will not be enough time to work through a wise \u2018ending\u2019 period with the foster carers, or indeed the therapist. Nor is there likely to be enough time to introduce the new family\/carers in a thoughtful way. This is the external life situation of the child who comes into the waiting room, the child whom we hope we can help in some way through psychotherapy. No wonder many therapists feel great despair about patients such as these \u2013 partly from what is projected into them by the child (and at times other professionals in the network), partly from their own personal response to the enormity of the therapeutic task. In this commentary, I have decided to focus on three intertwined themes: Jackie\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to \ufb01nd a way in which the various parts of her self and her life might be able to coexist; the need for the therapist to work as creatively as possible with the transition itself, which is also about a form of co-existence \u2013 of the loss of one foster home whilst trying to be as positive as possible about the possibilities of a new foster home; and the dif\ufb01culties of the counter-transference experience, which the therapist needs to process in order to hold the whole endeavour on the path of therapeutic change. I have chosen these themes out of many possible themes because, from the therapist\u2019s notes, they are the most \u2018alive\u2019 to me, and also because I have found from my own and from supervisees\u2019 experience, that within these very distressing transitional experiences in life, there is also a rich potential for internal change which can be therapeutically harnessed. With this in mind, my attention was drawn to the way in which Jackie seemed to be rather preoccupied with her sense of \u2018self\u2019, who she truly \u2018is\u2019, almost despite feeling \ufb02ooded and overwhelmed by all that is happening to her. Jackie\u2019s sense of being made up of many disconnected and irreconcilable parts is very much in keeping with the 104 CLINICAL COMMENTARY D o w n l o a d e d B y : [ T a v i s t o c k & P o r t m a n C e n t r e ] A t : : J u n e 0whole issue of what it feels like to be \u2018in transition\u2019 How on earth can such utterly different life experiences be held within her? How can she be both the girl who grew up in the deprived housing estate and the girl now living with her \u2018posh\u2019 foster mother, having therapy with a \u2018posh\u2019 therapist? Similarly, how can she be both the girl trying to cope with the prospect of separating from the foster mother\/family that she has lived with for a quarter of her life and the girl facing the hopeful but also frightening prospect of going to live with, and trying to come to trust and love, a foster carer or foster family, who (unless the family member is able to look after her), are completely unknown to her. Transitions are about both-ness, not either-or-ness. Staying with this paradox and holding all these apparently mutually exclusive feelings and experiences within the mind and heart, is what the therapist has to try to do in the \ufb01rst instance through the work in the counter-transference. If the therapist becomes able to bear this, then the child has not only the experience of having these intense and paradoxical transitional anxieties contained, but also has the possibility of internalising this kind of containment. Jackie expresses her concerns about who she is in what at \ufb01rst appears to be a rather super\ufb01cial way \u2013 through her delight in the new trainers and clothes that her foster mother bought her for her birthday. She is clearly really pleased with them and feels good inside them. Later in the session she makes the point that the top, trainers and jacket are all of the \u2018same make\u2019 This immediately had me thinking about the fact that Jackie\u2019s internal world is not at all \u2018of the same make\u2019. She is made up of very disparate internalised parental \ufb01gures \u2013 a sort of hotch-potch of birth parents, possibly past foster carers, present foster carers, and indeed fantasised future long-term foster-carers. Just prior to this, Jackie possibly had thoughts about her next home and carers whilst she was building the badger\u2019s den. I had a sense that this was not necessarily a safe place that could meet her needs \u2013 and indeed the therapist could not \ufb01t into it, and Jackie did not seem to want to try to \ufb01t into. It had more of a feel of a \u2018lair\u2019, which could become dangerous, a seductively warm-looking place which could turn out to be a trap. But these are my associations \u2013 the therapist clearly had a different feel about it. It is after this bit of play around the badger\u2019s den that Jackie talks about the clothes being of the same make and then tells the therapist about the inappropriately sexualised clothing that her birth family gave to her \u2013 which she also likes. I think her problem here is that of how does she put all of this together into being one person, one self, one body, rather than many. How does she hold such different aspects of herself in her head without \u2018cracks appearing in the ceiling\u2019 (of her head) \u2013 which \u2018the teacher at school (apparently) found so frightening that she fainted\u2019? I might have been tempted to say something about this to her. At this point, possibly it does all feel too much, and Jackie needs to leave the room on the pretext of going to the toilet. When she returns to the room, Jackie produces the powerful image of a lemon and talks about its sourness, which she associates with her birth parents. It may be that Jackie is aware here of the sourness of her relationship with her birth parents, an attachment which feels sour \u2013 but an attachment which may nevertheless feel better than nothing. The therapist\u2019s mind is meanwhile painfully full of her awareness of all the external uncertainties in Jackie\u2019s life and she is very much in touch with the CLINICAL COMMENTARY 105 D o w n l o a d e d B y : [ T a v i s t o c k & P o r t m a n C e n t r e ] A t : : J u n e 0poignancy of Jackie\u2019s situation of not knowing where she belongs and to whom she belongs. For me, this associates to the \u2018drawing\u2019 feeling of sourness in the mouth. The therapist, having felt lost for words over Jackie\u2019s predicament, simply talks to her in a soothing tone of voice \u2013 possibly the tone of voice being more important than the words themselves. I think this really helped Jackie to return to her thoughts about being made up of such different parts that do not \u2018go\u2019 together, unlike the clothes that are of the \u2018same make\u2019 She tries again to think about how she can be both the girl from the deprived estate and the girl with a posh foster-mum. Her initial attempt to see something like a \u2018both-ness\u2019 in this \u2013 expressed by the phrase \u2018you don\u2019t have to be posh to be privileged\u2019 \u2013 seems to be quickly abandoned and she gives up again. It is all too much and she suddenly wants to end the session. The therapist holds \ufb01rm and indicates that she is trying to contain and think about what feels so awful, and brie\ufb02y Jackie responds by coming back into the room and trying again to communicate some of the rawness of what she is feeling. She sings a song about someone whose mind has been blown and then tries to leave again \u2013 but actually hovers outside the therapy room door \u2013 a safe enough distance, still engaged with the therapist whom she seems to \ufb01nd it hard to leave despite her expressed wish to do so. She seems to want the therapist to accompany her through the corridors in which people might get lost, back to her foster mother. I am picking out this thread from many other threads in the session, because it has a more healthy developmental \ufb02avour about it and when thinking about the kind of salvage operation that therapy with children at this stage of life can often feel to be, I think that it is vital to spot these signs of potential growth. This thread gives a little bit of a \u2018direction to go in\u2019 \u2013 which connects to the question Jackie seemed to be asking her therapist earlier in the session on the way back from the toilet, about the signs indicating different room numbers in the clinic. Does the therapist know which direction to go in? All too often we can feel as lost as our patients. We can gain some bearings by spotting these kinds of green shoots. I now want to connect this material about sense of self, and identity, to the process of being \u2018in transition\u2019. Thinking practically, I think it is vital that therapists are as active as necessary in the professional network around these children in thinking about what is needed for this particular child, and the carers involved, to have both the opportunity to work through some of the feelings of loss that must be faced, and the feelings of expectation, fear and hope that surround the new placement. As decent a \u2018goodbye\u2019 as possible, to the carers, their family, friends and the school, can make a great difference to how much the child is able to be open to the possibility of forming a new attachment in the new placement. If the child is overwhelmed with feelings of loss that have not been thought about, at least a bit, this task is made even more dif\ufb01cult for the child. In my experience, these con\ufb02icting tasks of needing to mourn and attach simultaneously, have to be repeatedly spelt out to the professional network, as they are so hard to think about. Without this thinking in the network, there is likely to be a profound discontinuity in the child\u2019s external life experience, rather than a sense of a dif\ufb01cult but ultimately bearable transition. 106 CLINICAL COMMENTARY D o w n l o a d e d B y : [ T a v i s t o c k & P o r t m a n C e n t r e ] A t : : J u n e 0The therapist\u2019s work with his or her counter-transference experience is the process that can potentially hold all of this together. The therapist indicates several times how inadequate he or she feels with this patient, and also how anxious. This is a patient who sometimes won\u2019t stay in the room, who sometimes won\u2019t leave the waiting room, who can be violent and angry \u2013 the kind of patient that many of us come to dread seeing, as no doubt they dread seeing us. The therapist also feels in some ways de-skilled. This patient doesn\u2019t seem able to use interpretation at this stage of the therapy and constantly seems to challenge the conventional therapeutic boundaries. Containment and attunement are more helpful and we see a good example of this when the therapist is lost for words \u2013 but not for attunement \u2013 when the extent of Jackie\u2019s alone-ness feels so apparent. These painful times in therapy, when the patient seems to have really managed to get something across to the therapist, are tremendously important in the therapeutic process. They are usually wordless communications, in both directions. The therapist indicates her thinking that lead to this powerful communication \u2013 thoughts about Jackie\u2019s feeling lost in transition, and feeling unclaimed when her younger sister had been claimed and adopted. These are the therapist\u2019s musings about the awfulness of Jackie\u2019s life situation. This gives us a picture of some of the actual contents of the therapist\u2019s mind prior to the gentle soothing words that were so helpful. They are genuine, authentic and undefended against the pain that is being projected by the child. We see the therapist using her Self in an open way that gives the patient a direct experience that even these awful feelings can be willingly held, however dif\ufb01cult this may prove to be, by another human being who is trying to help her. In terms of Jackie\u2019s expectations that she will be rejected, this is a rather extraordinary experience and it is this that has Jackie lingering outside the therapy room door despite her anxiety, at the end of the session. There is, of course, so much more to be said about this session, but space does not permit. This open and honest account of the kind of session we all struggle with on so many levels has provided a valuable opportunity to share thinking about the dif\ufb01culties of working with children who are \u2018in transition\u2019.

She was referred to the local\nCAMHS team by her social worker with the request that she receive therapeutic support\nto help her manage the transitions with which she was faced. At this point and\nsubsequently, Jackie had frequent angry and violent outbursts that sometimes involved\nher being restrained. She had been excluded several times for attacking and swearing at\nschool staff. These outbursts dated back to when she was taken into the care of the local\nauthority.\nJackie was placed in a short-term foster placement two years ago and she has been\nable to stay with the same carer throughout this time. She has a much younger sister\nwho was placed in care shortly after her birth and she has now been adopted. Social\nServices were involved in Jackie\u2019s life from a relatively early age; she has experienced a\ngreat deal of chaos and neglect as well as witnessing episodes of domestic violence and\ninappropriate sexual behaviour. Jackie has regular supervised contact with members of\nher family.\nFollowing assessment, once-weekly psychotherapy was recommended and the session\nrecounted took place a year into treatment. Network meetings are organised on a half-\ntermly basis and this session took place a couple of days after the network met. The\nsubject of the meeting was raised during the previous session but Jackie was reluctant to\nthink about it with me. When Jackie started to attend sessions the plan was for her to be\nadopted, however, this changed to long-term foster care as no suitable adopters could be\nfound within the period stipulated. At the time of the session, a long-term placement\nwas still being sought whilst a family member had also decided to make yet another bid\nfor Jackie to be returned to her care. A move away from her carer, her school, her city\nand her therapy, was likely to take place with little notice.\nUnderstandably, the first year of Jackie\u2019s therapy has been characterised by con-\ntrolling behaviour that heightens when there has been a change in the external setting or\nfollowing contact visits. As can often be the case in transitional work, the balance of\nfocus on the internal or external world, as well as the positive or negative transference,\nhas been a continual struggle. In the transference, I am usually experienced as the\ninadequate, fragile parent who always gets things wrong but has to be protected, whilst\nat other times I am the denigrated child that is despised and not wanted. More formal\ninterpretations are usually dismissed and have precipitated her leaving the room; a\nJOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOTHERAPY\nVOL. 33 NO. 1 2007 94 \u2013 107\nJournal of Child Psychotherapy\nISSN 0075-417X print\/ISSN 1469-9370 online \u0002 2007 Association of Child Psychotherapists\nhttp:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals DOI: 10.1080\/00754170701195769\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:4\n5 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nsimple approach of attuning to states of mind and acknowledging thoughts and feelings\nseems to have facilitated development.\nSession\nAs I walked into the waiting room, Jackie was just sitting down at a children\u2019s desk with\npencil and paper in hand. Following last week\u2019s difficult journey along the corridors to\nthe therapy room, I felt relieved when Jackie looked up and smiled at me. The preceding\nweek she had refused to come to the therapy room without her carer; she spent the\nsession \u2018sorting out\u2019 her box so that she was ready to leave.\nJackie made no attempt to move until her carer (Mary) said that I was waiting and\nsuggested that she could take the piece of paper home with her and finish her drawing\nlater. She got up and gave her carer a hug and a kiss before coming with me.\nI noticed that Jackie was wearing a new outfit rather than her school uniform. As we\nwalked up the corridor she made a point of looking down at her pristine white trainers, I\nlooked at them too and said that she had some lovely new trainers on; Jackie gave a\nbeaming smile and nodded, she went on to tell me that she received her new clothes as a\nbirthday present from Mary. Jackie then started to tell me that her school was closed\nbecause there had been a flood the previous day.\nAs we walked into the room, Jackie adopted the usual routine of putting the light on\nbut as the room was bright and filled with sunshine, she hesitated and decided to leave\nthe light off. Continuing with the same subject, I said that she seemed happy about not\nhaving to go to school, she nodded and smiled whilst telling me that after the session,\nshe was going to pick up Georgina (Mary\u2019s granddaughter) and that she was coming to\nstay with them for the day. I asked what that was going to feel like for her, Jackie\nshrugged and I said that I remembered how sometimes it feels that Georgina has all the\nthings that she would really like; Jackie shrugged again and said that it felt okay today\nbecause she hasn\u2019t seen her for a long time. I felt concerned with how Jackie was going\nto manage the visit and was thinking about how to explore this further with her when\nshe returned to the subject of the flood at school. With excitement, Jackie talked about\nhow all of the water went rushing into all of the classrooms. I said that it sounded quite\nfrightening; Jackie shrugged and said that she wasn\u2019t frightened, but one of the teachers\ndid faint when cracks started to come through the ceiling in the computer room. Jackie\nadded, in a matter-of-fact tone, that the teachers told the children to be calm but they\nweren\u2019t themselves, they were all stressed. I said that it can be very hard for the children\nwhen the adults are worried. Silently, I thought about the high level of anxiety present\nin the adults during the last network meeting when we discussed Jackie\u2019s future and I\nalso thought about Jackie\u2019s struggle to not be \u2018flooded\u2019 by the surges of emotional\ndistress that she tries so hard to stem.\nJackie wanted my help to rearrange the sofa cushions so that she could make a badger\u2019s\nden. When she\u2019d finished constructing the small enclosure she asked me to get in, I\nreplied saying that it was too small for me to fit in but I could see that she\u2019d created a safe,\ncosy home and maybe she\u2019d like to try it out. Jackie refrained from climbing in but\ninstead she looked down to admire her new shoes again.

She went on to tell me that her top, trainers and jacket were the\nsame make, I agreed and said that she seemed very pleased with her new outfit. Jackie sat\ndown in the chair opposite me and in quite a factual, grown-up manner, told me that she\nhas high-heeled shoes and mini-skirts that come right up to here, indicating her upper\nthigh with the side of her hand. Silently, I remembered Mary telling me at the last review\nthat Jackie had recently had contact with a close family member who had dressed her up\nin clothes and make-up that were more in keeping with adult dress. Jackie had said to her\nrelative that she didn\u2019t think Mary would like what she was wearing. I asked Jackie if she\nliked high-heels and mini-skirts, she nodded and smiled, and then she asked me if I did. I\nreplied to Jackie saying that I thought she was asking me if it was okay for people to be\ndifferent and to like different things. Jackie asked me what the time was and when I said\nthat we had 25 minutes left, she said that she needed to go to the loo. Whilst waiting for\nJackie to return from the loo, I thought about her sensitivity to my responses and how\nreadily she experiences my words as rejecting.\nAs we walked back to the therapy room, Jackie asked me about the signs indicating the\nvarious room numbers, I said that she\u2019d noticed the signs today and they help people to\nknow which direction to go in. Jackie nodded, seeming to be satisfied by my answer. The\nthought of Jackie feeling lost and not knowing where she will live, came into my mind.\nBack inside the room, she collected two pieces of paper and gave one to me; she led by\ncutting out an oval shape that was then coloured in yellow to make a lemon. Jackie\nexplained that she liked sour tastes, I wondered about this and asked if she knew anyone\nelse that did too, she told me that her mummy and daddy did. I said that she\u2019d been\nthinking about mummy and daddy; Jackie nodded but didn\u2019t say anymore. After a\ncouple of minutes passed (now she was drawing another fruit, which I couldn\u2019t identify) I\nsaid that we\u2019d had a meeting here last week to think about her and what it was like to have\nto keep waiting and still not knowing what was happening and who she was going to be\nliving with. In a slightly omniscient way, Jackie said that she did know what was\nhappening, at first she was going to be adopted but now she is going into long-term foster\ncare. I replied that maybe she had been wondering about why the plan had changed (the\nthought of her younger, adopted sister came into my mind), Jackie shrugged and I felt\nlost for something to say that would soothe the terrible reality of little interest being\nshown in her advert. In a quiet and soft tone, I said that it was so hard and so unfair.\nJackie finished her drawing and I was instructed to copy it. As I was drawing the lemon\nshe pointed out that I had made a few mistakes, she corrected me and then offered to do\nit for me. I was aware of feeling inadequate and noted how familiar this role had become.\nJackie got up to play with the ball; we had a few turns of our commonly played game\nof counting how many throws we can make without dropping it. I started to say\nsomething about how difficult it can feel to get things wrong and to make mistakes\nwhen Jackie looked at me and smiled, she said \u2018You don\u2019t have to be posh to be\nprivileged\u2019. I wondered where that had come from and Jackie said it was from the advert\nwith the posh woman who drives a car. She put on a \u2018posh\u2019 voice and repeated the\nphrase. I asked her if she thought I was posh, she nodded and smiled, I couldn\u2019t help\nsmiling too and I asked if she thought Mary was as well. Jackie nodded and said that\nMary says \u2018isn\u2019t it\u2019 and her mummy, daddy and herself say \u2018innit\u2019. I said that she was\nthinking again about people being different.

I am struck by\nthe gritty determination of this 8-year-old girl. She is in a situation that is so hurtful that\nthe therapist has to work hard in order to bear witnessing it. Excluded from her birth\nhome, she is meant to be waiting for a permanent placement. We can see that she is doing\nno such thing. She is holding tight to the home and carer that has been hers for a quarter\nof her life, her home from 6 years of age. It will be important for the adults managing her\nlife to acknowledge how strong is her current attachment and her ability to have held on\nto it. This is her achievement, not to be overlooked. Jackie has managed to stay in her\nfoster home, to like what her foster mother gives her and whatever Jackie has done over\nthe past 2 years, to not push foster mum beyond her capacity to bear her. If I notice this,\nit is because it is not uncommon for an angry rejected child to work assiduously to slough\noff her own hopelessness and rage onto the foster carer as the placement breaks down. So\nJackie is not doing that badly with the situation she has been dropped in.\nThe therapist is right; Jackie sees that the adults are struggling with the flood that\nbecomes a metaphor for her impending move. She denies her own fear but describes the\nteacher as fainting. It is an interesting word to use because it depicts the teacher as losing\nconsciousness of her situation when in extreme danger. So we hear Jackie\u2019s slight scorn\nfor adults who cannot bear catastrophe and her accusation to grown-ups who are felt\nto accuse and criticise the children for what they do themselves \u2018to be calm but they\nweren\u2019t themselves, they were all stressed\u2019. This is probably a key constellation of\nfeelings for Jackie. She feels persecuted by the adults\u2019 demand to bear her situation. No\nwonder she leaves the room or changes the subject when she hears these requests.\nWhat is needed perhaps in this flood and what is lacking, is the idea that the adults\nand children are in it together and must do their best to help each other. This may\nappeal more to this fearless little girl who is trying to make her own home in the session.\nCLINICAL COMMENTARY 97\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:4\n5 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nI have been thinking a lot about attachment styles recently as the vogue for these\nconcepts shows that they may be easier to grasp than \u2018object relations\u2019. What is at the\nheart of attachment is trust and dependency \u2013 can the adult be trusted to help the child?\nIt is a common solution if the child cannot trust and yet must depend, to try to control\nthe adult. Cichetti and Toth (1995), in their work concerning the consequences of\ninfant maltreatment, cite research evidence to show that by four years the poorly treated,\ninsecurely attached child is controlling to their carer, by six they have generalised this\nstyle to have mainly controlling relationships.\nChildren in foster care may be well adapted to survive the poor care-giving styles of\ntheir parents and, more sadly, they may need these controlling ways to give them some\nsense of mastery in a care system that will take two or three years to find them a\npermanent home. It is difficult to argue that the child should trust us when we cannot\ntrust ourselves to get them to a place of security.\nJackie knows where her best bet is though. She was not pretending that she did not\ncare about her foster-mum. She was clinging to her, causing trouble on \u2018the difficult\njourney along the corridors to the therapy room\u2019. The analogy is persuasive; she refused\nto come without her carer. She was saying she does not want to leave this carer. In this\nsession too, Jackie demonstrates her feeling of protest at having to leave her foster-mum\nbehind. The hug and the kiss are to show the therapist where Jackie\u2019s loyalties lie and\nhave the added meaning of making the therapist occupy the role of an unwanted person.\nSimilarly, Jackie loves the trainers that were a gift from the carer and their presence acts\nalmost as a transitional object to encourage her to separate. She smiles and includes the\ntherapist at this point. This is a child who can take in good things.\nThen we have the passage about the flood with which her therapist is in tune.\nWhen Jackie makes a badger\u2019s den I wonder is she attempting to show the therapist\nwhat a survivor she is and the request for the therapist to climb in may have the\nmeaning \u2013 you go first, you see what it is like, I want to stay with someone who gives me\nnew shoes that complement what I already have. But the association of her clothes\nmatching leads her to a different match \u2013 that of herself with her birth relatives. Jackie\nshows herself to be acutely aware of the difference and disagreement between her foster\ncarer and her birth relatives. We come in this way to what I see as the other great theme of\nthis session: Who is Jackie and where does she belong? This is an issue that affects every\nchild brought up outside their family of origin. It is often approached via the trappings of\nclass or culture or family styles. I think Jackie is acutely aware of differences in manner\nand belief between her foster home and birth home. Usually foster carers are middle-class\nliberals. Usually children in care come from families who are poorer, working class, more\nauthoritarian in their beliefs. No one likes to admit this but the birth family will often cite\nit as a convenient reason for why their children are taken away.\nIt is possible that since I do not know the details in this case, the generalisation may\nbe an inaccurate caricature. My experiences with children in care has sensitised me to\nthese unmentionable aspects, which I then see children struggle with alone. The other\ncommon theme is how the foster-carers\u2019 children are more loved than the fostered\nchildren. How can we pretend this is not so? These hard facts are an important part of\nwhat the child has to bear and they will be endlessly addressed during their turbulent\nadolescence.\n98 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:4\n5 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nIn Jackie\u2019s session she is raising the idea that being Mary\u2019s girl is different from being\nmum or aunty\u2019s girl and if she moves to another home she will have to adapt again to\nanother posh family. We therapists are posh so we do not get this, Jackie thinks. But\naccording to the material, Jackie is not thinking of her next posh home. She is thinking\nthat she must revert to being mummy and daddy\u2019s girl who says \u2018innit\u2019 and who likes\nsour lemons. Jackie\u2019s song-and-dance routine links, I imagine, to this identification. It is\nabout boyfriends and a hint of drug culture \u2013 not that I believe Jackie will know this \u2013\nbut it may be the kind of thing her relatives feel is cute and she is showing her\ntherapist \u2013 \u2018this is who I am now\u2019. This supposition is reinforced by Jackie wanting to\nleave at this point. Now she is anxious to get back to her foster-carer and re-establish a\nsafer place to belong. The attachment strength of the girl of a poor care-giving mother\nand father only comes into its own as it is slowly revealed to the child that everyone else\ncan give notice to quit; that these excellent carers are temporary. What her birth family\nmay lack in security in the short term will be gradually reassessed in its longevity.\nJackie hides her disloyalty to her carer by substituting her wish to abandon the\ntherapist. She gains some pleasure by controlling the end of the session and making the\ntherapist bear the feelings of being left whilst she can harbour the illusion that she has a\nlittle control of when and where she will be moved. It is of course problematic that\nshe buoys herself up with the illusion that she is fearless whilst the adults close their\neyes to disaster. It is hard to learn academically with a belief that adults are foolish. With\nthis belief, it will be unlikely that Jackie will allow herself to be vulnerable to a new carer.\nThe best that can be done is for the network around her to honour the strength of her\nattachments and build in links, contact, visits back to Mary, when the time arrives to\nleave.\nChild and Family Clinic\nSt Peter\u2019s House\n2 Bricket Rd\nSt Albans AL1 3JW\nUK\ne-mail: Margaret.Smallbone@hpt.nhs.uk\nReference\nCICHETTI, D. and TOTH, S.L.

Was she, rather, spectator to domestic\nviolence and inappropriate sexual behaviour? I wonder if she is one of those children\nwho may, because of the good intentions of the Children Act 1989 and because of the\ndifficulties for social workers of meeting thresholds for action on behalf of a child, have\nyo-yoed in and out of care before finally being removed from home. The disturbances\nand deprivation of that home life can become \u2018normal\u2019 for the child. But the deprivation\ncan have a long-term impact on the child\u2019s physical, neurological (Perry et al., 1995) and\nemotional development. The cumulative impact of true deficit, of not being held in\nmind in their own right or helped to make sense of the experience, can lead to a massive\nlack of trust in any adults, particularly those who claim any parental or carer functions\n(Kenrick, 2000; Khan, 1986).\nThere is an issue in Jackie\u2019s life, as described, around contact with members of her\nbirth family. We do not know with whom she has contact, only that after contact she\ncan become very unsettled. Before children are permanently placed, and if, as for Jackie,\nthis process can take some years, the \u2018pull\u2019 of the family of origin can become\nparticularly strong. Often when these children leave care they may gravitate back to the\nbirth family \u2013 the \u2018normal\u2019 from which they were removed, and then moved through the\ndifferent cultures of each family in which they were placed.\nIn the description given of Jackie\u2019s early life we are left to wonder about these and\nmany other issues, and this may be a most useful state of mind to adopt. Cleverly, I\nthink this therapist shows us how well she is able to wonder about many levels of\nJackie\u2019s experience in the session she presents, by giving us less rather than more\ninformation ensures that we remain in the wondering-about state of mind. Her\ncomments on how she is experienced in the transference \u2013 as the \u2018inadequate fragile\nparent who always gets things wrong\u2019 or as \u2018the denigrated child that is despised and\nnot wanted\u2019 \u2013 may give us as much clue as we will ever have about Jackie\u2019s early\nexperience.\nWith work with children in transitional placements, for whom so much is unknown\nand is always uncertain, the countertransference is the all-important tool for the\ntherapist. Jackie\u2019s therapist informs us by describing hers and how with great sensitivity\nshe uses it in what she so carefully says to Jackie. She has learnt through her year\u2019s work\nwith Jackie that Jackie can make much greater use in the session of her therapist\u2019s\ncapacity to be attuned to her states of mind and to describe feelings rather than to give a\nmore conventional interpretation. The issue in this work is one of providing the\ncontainment (Bion, 1959) of which these children may have had so little. The dilemma\ncan be that providing such containment can in itself reinforce the child\u2019s feelings of\ndeprivation. Bion describes how \u2018the patient feels he is being allowed an opportunity of\nwhich he has hitherto been cheated; the poignancy of his deprivation is thereby\nrendered more acute and so are feelings of resentment at the deprivation\u2019 (Bion, 1959).\nHence the therapist routinely is faced with the technical dilemma of what to say, how to\nsay it, and when (Kenrick, 2005). We are privileged that Jackie\u2019s therapist shares her\ndilemmas with us.\n100 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:4\n5 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nThe session\nJackie\u2019s smile in the waiting room is a relief to her therapist. With volatile children who\ncan often flee pain and thinking with behaviours that can be hard to manage, the\ntherapist\u2019s initial view of the child can be as quick as that of the child, whose very\nsurvival amidst domestic turbulence may have depended on taking in an emotional\nclimate with the swiftest of glances. The therapist\u2019s glance may also give her some idea of\nwhether the child may be in a predominantly persecutory state of anxiety \u2013 more\nworried about the more vengeful or malevolent states within the therapist, here the\nanxiety of what has remained projected from the previous session \u2013 or a more depressive\nconcern for her object \u2013 has she survived the previous onslaughts? Probably states of\nmind in the child will oscillate between predominately persecutory or depressive\nanxieties. In the waiting room, the carer rather beautifully helps Jackie to separate.\nPerhaps over time she has come to value what the therapy is achieving with Jackie.\nAs Jackie and the therapist walk down the corridor, their conversation there helps to\ncarry Jackie through yet another transitional experience, from carer to therapist. We are\nshown a combination of the therapist noticing and wondering about what is different\ntoday \u2013 which turns out to be a key to her own thinking in the session \u2013 and the way in\nwhich Jackie draws attention to it. Although accepted wisdom about practice suggests\nthat as therapists we delay communication with our patients until the \u2018work\u2019 begins in\nthe therapy room, what would it have meant to Jackie if her therapist had not\ncommented on the shoes? After all, she knows about Jackie\u2019s birthday. A birthday is so\ncomplex a time for children who are not living in their birth families: it brings thoughts\nof the birth mother in particular, of the kind of intercourse the child may have come\nfrom, or of rejection or abandonment. Here it is interesting that Jackie draws attention\nto the clothes given her by Mary, the foster carer. One wonders what is in her mind.\nWhat then does the flood at school mean to her at a deeper level? Are the two linked,\nsuggesting a flood of feelings about her birthday? This possible link does not emerge\ndirectly in the session.\nIn the therapy room, Jackie starts with her usual routine with the lights. This\nunderlines children\u2019s needs for sameness, for routines when their lives can at times seem\nso uncertain, so not the same. Established by her routine, Jackie can now notice that\nthere is sunshine in the room, a more positive moment, as all does not necessarily\nbecome flooded. I felt it was helpful that at this point the therapist makes an ordinary\ncomment about Jackie\u2019s observed happy state of mind. Now Jackie can develop her own\nthoughts. Today she does not want to think about her therapist\u2019s thought about what\nfeelings Mary\u2019s granddaughter can stir up in her. To touch too quickly on her feelings of\ndeprivation might have sent her in flight from the room, cf. Bion above, flooded too\nquickly.\nAs Jackie returns to the actual flood at school her therapist\u2019s more general comments\nabout what adults\u2019 responses and preoccupations with their own feelings can mean to\nchildren places the thinking in a safe, more Winnicottian transitional area, not too close.\nBut Jackie becomes more excited. I wonder how much she may use manic defences\nagainst anxieties. All of this is going through the therapist\u2019s mind; also she is thinking\nabout her own concern about what happens in the adult network when Jackie\u2019s future is\nCLINICAL COMMENTARY 101\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:4\n5 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\ndiscussed. This puts me in mind of Emanuel\u2019s Triple Deprivation (Emanuel, 2006).\nEmanuel describes how when the projections and projective identifications seem to take\noff in the professional network it can be hard for the adults to focus on the emotional\nneeds of the child. Thereby an additional level of deprivation is added.\nI felt the therapist was wise to resist going into the \u2018badger\u2019s den\u2019. I wondered if she\nhad learnt from previous experience, or whether there was a countertransference\nresponse, which she did not note in her text. Was there something not quite right about\nthe internal space Jackie had created? There may have been an issue around rejection as\nvoiced by the therapist. I noticed more that Jackie herself did not go into the den. Quite\noften deprived or abused children present us with invitations to enter cosy dens. They\nrarely are cosy. More often they seem to carry a feeling of hot, sometimes sexual, inside\nplaces, more like a deeply ambiguous claustrum (Meltzer, 1992).\nThere is talk now about the different clothes. The therapist gives us information that\nshe had about conflicts between the birth family and foster carer about their different\nviews of Jackie and what is appropriate for her in the way of clothes. Am I alone, or just\nin identification perhaps with Jackie, in hoping that she could stay long-term with Mary\nwho seems to understand her so well? I felt that the therapist\u2019s comments to Jackie\nabout differences between people evoked feelings in her less of rejection than of the\nconflicts between the different family cultures that she is experiencing so often. She\nmust wonder too what is her therapist\u2019s view of her. These feelings are too powerful for\nher at this moment and she flees to the loo \u2013 possibly as much to create a gap between\nherself and the thinking therapist, as to deposit the flood of feelings in concrete form in\nthe loo. Whichever predominates, the therapist is protected from Jackie\u2019s feelings\nflooding out in the room possibly in a violent way. Again Jackie needs support as she\nreturns to the room. Again the therapist thinks about Jackie\u2019s wider predicament as she\ngives a factual response to Jackie\u2019s question. We see once more the therapist working at\nan interface between Jackie\u2019s internal and external worlds. A technical question is\nhighlighted at this moment: is Jackie a child who needs more \u2018ordinary\u2019 information or\nresponses at times in order to help her to stay oriented? This can be difficult to judge for\na therapist working with children for whom it can seem that the external is insufficiently\nheld by the network or explained to the children.\nThe material about the lemon and sour tastes is vivid. Jackie is able to explore more\ndirectly thoughts about her parents while she quietly cuts out and colours. I think\nthat her parents may be in her mind because of her birthday, as I have already\nsuggested. She may also have had family contact recently because of the birthday.\nJackie has to shrug off with omniscience the therapist\u2019s direct references to the\nmeeting of professionals and plans for her future. She is perhaps a bit too pulled into\nthe external agenda briefly: but soon returns to the internal as she ponders within\nherself on the unbearable pain of the rejection and lack of interest in Jackie. She\ncontains this beautifully and puts into words the unfairness and how hard it is. This I\nthink Jackie can hear, and she needs to know that her situation really is hard and\nunfair. Both she and the therapist are impotent to change this. How well the therapist\nputs her countertransference into words.\nFollowing the to and fro of the ballgame \u2013 a return to something familiar after she\nwas touched by pain, even though it was quickly denied and projected into the\n102 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:4\n5 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\ntherapist \u2013 Jackie brings in the new thought. She must have been pleased that she could\nmake her therapist smile rather than be put out by being described as \u2018posh\u2019. Here is an\nindication of how Jackie must be struggling with making sense of the different cultures\nwith which she is involved. This time as the therapist respects Jackie\u2019s need for defences,\nshe is able to prevent Jackie from ending the session immediately. She says that Jackie\ndid not have to go on thinking about what was too much. She offers her own thinking\nmind as a container for the unbearable. Jackie stays. She does have to control the actual\nending, and is a bit triumphant when she returns to the foster carer. By now she must\nknow her therapist will survive and that the therapy may be one of the few areas in her\nlife over which she has a little bit of control. Alvarez (1992) speaks usefully about the\nneed to differentiate between omnipotence and potency. The therapist will be able to\nhelp Jackie make this differentiation over time.\nThis session is a beautiful example of great sensitivity by the therapist in working with\nthe pain and uncertainties of a child in transition. In this session at least, she is able to\nhold the flooding of feelings, which could lead to acting out of the kind that is so hard\nfor therapists to manage. After a year\u2019s work together, the therapist knows about the\nfluctuations in Jackie\u2019s states of mind. She takes care not to oppress or to risk\npersecuting Jackie with thoughts that Jackie may only be able to reach very slowly. That\nis to say, she respects the defences that Jackie may need in order to survive the\nuncertainties of her life\u2019s experiences. The therapist is the one making the active links in\nher mind between what Jackie brings to the session and the sour realities of life in the\nexternal world.

Jackie is an 8-year-old\nchild who has a \u2018short-term\u2019 foster carer that she has been with for 2 years and regular\nsupervised contact with members of her birth family. She needs a permanent home that\nthe professionals responsible for her care are trying to find, without much success. We\ngather that there is a lot of anxiety in the network about this.\nThe therapist seems to feel that he or she can do little to ensure that the move to a\nmore permanent placement happens in a measured way. There is an anxiety that the\nmove will be precipitate and create further traumatic loss in Jackie\u2019s life. There is also a\nfear that there will not be enough time to work through a wise \u2018ending\u2019 period with the\nfoster carers, or indeed the therapist. Nor is there likely to be enough time to introduce\nthe new family\/carers in a thoughtful way. This is the external life situation of the child\nwho comes into the waiting room, the child whom we hope we can help in some way\nthrough psychotherapy. No wonder many therapists feel great despair about patients\nsuch as these \u2013 partly from what is projected into them by the child (and at times other\nprofessionals in the network), partly from their own personal response to the enormity\nof the therapeutic task.\nIn this commentary, I have decided to focus on three intertwined themes: Jackie\u2019s\nunsuccessful efforts to find a way in which the various parts of her self and her life might\nbe able to coexist; the need for the therapist to work as creatively as possible with the\ntransition itself, which is also about a form of co-existence \u2013 of the loss of one foster\nhome whilst trying to be as positive as possible about the possibilities of a new foster\nhome; and the difficulties of the counter-transference experience, which the therapist\nneeds to process in order to hold the whole endeavour on the path of therapeutic\nchange.\nI have chosen these themes out of many possible themes because, from the therapist\u2019s\nnotes, they are the most \u2018alive\u2019 to me, and also because I have found from my own and\nfrom supervisees\u2019 experience, that within these very distressing transitional experiences\nin life, there is also a rich potential for internal change which can be therapeutically\nharnessed.\nWith this in mind, my attention was drawn to the way in which Jackie seemed to be\nrather preoccupied with her sense of \u2018self\u2019, who she truly \u2018is\u2019, almost despite feeling\nflooded and overwhelmed by all that is happening to her. Jackie\u2019s sense of being made\nup of many disconnected and irreconcilable parts is very much in keeping with the\n104 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:4\n5 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nwhole issue of what it feels like to be \u2018in transition\u2019 How on earth can such utterly\ndifferent life experiences be held within her? How can she be both the girl who grew up\nin the deprived housing estate and the girl now living with her \u2018posh\u2019 foster mother,\nhaving therapy with a \u2018posh\u2019 therapist? Similarly, how can she be both the girl trying to\ncope with the prospect of separating from the foster mother\/family that she has lived\nwith for a quarter of her life and the girl facing the hopeful but also frightening prospect\nof going to live with, and trying to come to trust and love, a foster carer or foster family,\nwho (unless the family member is able to look after her), are completely unknown\nto her.\nTransitions are about both-ness, not either-or-ness. Staying with this paradox and\nholding all these apparently mutually exclusive feelings and experiences within the\nmind and heart, is what the therapist has to try to do in the first instance through\nthe work in the counter-transference. If the therapist becomes able to bear this, then\nthe child has not only the experience of having these intense and paradoxical\ntransitional anxieties contained, but also has the possibility of internalising this kind of\ncontainment.\nJackie expresses her concerns about who she is in what at first appears to be a rather\nsuperficial way \u2013 through her delight in the new trainers and clothes that her foster\nmother bought her for her birthday. She is clearly really pleased with them and feels\ngood inside them. Later in the session she makes the point that the top, trainers and\njacket are all of the \u2018same make\u2019 This immediately had me thinking about the fact that\nJackie\u2019s internal world is not at all \u2018of the same make\u2019. She is made up of very disparate\ninternalised parental figures \u2013 a sort of hotch-potch of birth parents, possibly past foster\ncarers, present foster carers, and indeed fantasised future long-term foster-carers.\nJust prior to this, Jackie possibly had thoughts about her next home and carers whilst\nshe was building the badger\u2019s den. I had a sense that this was not necessarily a safe place\nthat could meet her needs \u2013 and indeed the therapist could not fit into it, and Jackie did\nnot seem to want to try to fit into. It had more of a feel of a \u2018lair\u2019, which could become\ndangerous, a seductively warm-looking place which could turn out to be a trap. But\nthese are my associations \u2013 the therapist clearly had a different feel about it. It is after\nthis bit of play around the badger\u2019s den that Jackie talks about the clothes being of the\nsame make and then tells the therapist about the inappropriately sexualised clothing that\nher birth family gave to her \u2013 which she also likes. I think her problem here is that of\nhow does she put all of this together into being one person, one self, one body, rather\nthan many. How does she hold such different aspects of herself in her head without\n\u2018cracks appearing in the ceiling\u2019 (of her head) \u2013 which \u2018the teacher at school (apparently)\nfound so frightening that she fainted\u2019? I might have been tempted to say something\nabout this to her. At this point, possibly it does all feel too much, and Jackie needs to\nleave the room on the pretext of going to the toilet.\nWhen she returns to the room, Jackie produces the powerful image of a lemon and\ntalks about its sourness, which she associates with her birth parents. It may be that\nJackie is aware here of the sourness of her relationship with her birth parents, an\nattachment which feels sour \u2013 but an attachment which may nevertheless feel better\nthan nothing. The therapist\u2019s mind is meanwhile painfully full of her awareness of all\nthe external uncertainties in Jackie\u2019s life and she is very much in touch with the\nCLINICAL COMMENTARY 105\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:4\n5 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\npoignancy of Jackie\u2019s situation of not knowing where she belongs and to whom she\nbelongs. For me, this associates to the \u2018drawing\u2019 feeling of sourness in the mouth. The\ntherapist, having felt lost for words over Jackie\u2019s predicament, simply talks to her in a\nsoothing tone of voice \u2013 possibly the tone of voice being more important than the words\nthemselves.\nI think this really helped Jackie to return to her thoughts about being made up of\nsuch different parts that do not \u2018go\u2019 together, unlike the clothes that are of the \u2018same\nmake\u2019 She tries again to think about how she can be both the girl from the deprived\nestate and the girl with a posh foster-mum. Her initial attempt to see something like\na \u2018both-ness\u2019 in this \u2013 expressed by the phrase \u2018you don\u2019t have to be posh to be\nprivileged\u2019 \u2013 seems to be quickly abandoned and she gives up again. It is all too much\nand she suddenly wants to end the session.\nThe therapist holds firm and indicates that she is trying to contain and think about\nwhat feels so awful, and briefly Jackie responds by coming back into the room and\ntrying again to communicate some of the rawness of what she is feeling. She sings a song\nabout someone whose mind has been blown and then tries to leave again \u2013 but actually\nhovers outside the therapy room door \u2013 a safe enough distance, still engaged with the\ntherapist whom she seems to find it hard to leave despite her expressed wish to do so.\nShe seems to want the therapist to accompany her through the corridors in which\npeople might get lost, back to her foster mother.\nI am picking out this thread from many other threads in the session, because it has a\nmore healthy developmental flavour about it and when thinking about the kind of\nsalvage operation that therapy with children at this stage of life can often feel to be, I\nthink that it is vital to spot these signs of potential growth. This thread gives a little bit\nof a \u2018direction to go in\u2019 \u2013 which connects to the question Jackie seemed to be asking her\ntherapist earlier in the session on the way back from the toilet, about the signs indicating\ndifferent room numbers in the clinic. Does the therapist know which direction to go in?\nAll too often we can feel as lost as our patients. We can gain some bearings by spotting\nthese kinds of green shoots.\nI now want to connect this material about sense of self, and identity, to the process of\nbeing \u2018in transition\u2019. Thinking practically, I think it is vital that therapists are as active as\nnecessary in the professional network around these children in thinking about what\nis needed for this particular child, and the carers involved, to have both the opportunity\nto work through some of the feelings of loss that must be faced, and the feelings of\nexpectation, fear and hope that surround the new placement. As decent a \u2018goodbye\u2019\nas possible, to the carers, their family, friends and the school, can make a great difference\nto how much the child is able to be open to the possibility of forming a new attachment\nin the new placement.\nIf the child is overwhelmed with feelings of loss that have not been thought about, at\nleast a bit, this task is made even more difficult for the child. In my experience, these\nconflicting tasks of needing to mourn and attach simultaneously, have to be repeatedly\nspelt out to the professional network, as they are so hard to think about. Without\nthis thinking in the network, there is likely to be a profound discontinuity in the child\u2019s\nexternal life experience, rather than a sense of a difficult but ultimately bearable\ntransition.\n106 CLINICAL COMMENTARY\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:4\n5 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\nThe therapist\u2019s work with his or her counter-transference experience is the process\nthat can potentially hold all of this together. The therapist indicates several times how\ninadequate he or she feels with this patient, and also how anxious. This is a patient who\nsometimes won\u2019t stay in the room, who sometimes won\u2019t leave the waiting room, who\ncan be violent and angry \u2013 the kind of patient that many of us come to dread seeing, as\nno doubt they dread seeing us. The therapist also feels in some ways de-skilled. This\npatient doesn\u2019t seem able to use interpretation at this stage of the therapy and constantly\nseems to challenge the conventional therapeutic boundaries. Containment and\nattunement are more helpful and we see a good example of this when the therapist is\nlost for words \u2013 but not for attunement \u2013 when the extent of Jackie\u2019s alone-ness feels so\napparent.\nThese painful times in therapy, when the patient seems to have really managed to get\nsomething across to the therapist, are tremendously important in the therapeutic\nprocess. They are usually wordless communications, in both directions. The therapist\nindicates her thinking that lead to this powerful communication \u2013 thoughts about\nJackie\u2019s feeling lost in transition, and feeling unclaimed when her younger sister had\nbeen claimed and adopted. These are the therapist\u2019s musings about the awfulness of\nJackie\u2019s life situation. This gives us a picture of some of the actual contents of the\ntherapist\u2019s mind prior to the gentle soothing words that were so helpful. They are\ngenuine, authentic and undefended against the pain that is being projected by the child.\nWe see the therapist using her Self in an open way that gives the patient a direct\nexperience that even these awful feelings can be willingly held, however difficult this\nmay prove to be, by another human being who is trying to help her. In terms of Jackie\u2019s\nexpectations that she will be rejected, this is a rather extraordinary experience and it is\nthis that has Jackie lingering outside the therapy room door despite her anxiety, at the\nend of the session.\nThere is, of course, so much more to be said about this session, but space does not\npermit. This open and honest account of the kind of session we all struggle with on so\nmany levels has provided a valuable opportunity to share thinking about the difficulties\nof working with children who are \u2018in transition\u2019.\nBritish Association of Psychotherapists\n37 Mapesbury Road\nLondon NW2 4 HJ\nUK\nCLINICAL COMMENTARY 107\nD\no\nw\nn\nlo\nad\ned\n B\ny:\n [\nTa\nvi\nst\noc\nk \n& \nPo\nrt\nma\nn \nCe\nnt\nre\n] \nAt\n: \n11\n:4\n5 \n8 \nJu\nne\n 2\n01\n0\n"}
