The processing is performed in \nthree stages. Initially a dry fibrous reinforcement (pre-form) is placed in a rigid mould cavity. \nThen, forced impregnation by a liquid resin occurs (filling stage). Finally the mould is heated up, \ncross-linking of the thermosetting matrix material takes place and the composite cures. Although \nmany problems of the conventional laying-up\/autoclaving process connected to prepreg \npreparation and green composite handling are eliminated, other important matters arise in the \nRTM process. The impregnation stage becomes and  the necessity to decouple the infiltration \nfrom the curing stage leads to the need for specialized resins and adapted thermal cycles.  \nMeasurement  Science and Technology 11 (2000) 25-31  \nIn recent years the filling stage of RTM has been studied extensively.  Flow models based on \nDarcy\u2019s law have been developed [1-3] and the mechanisms of resin impregnation have been \nanalyzed [4,5] in order to predict filling behaviour. These analyses have provided an ability to \nestimate filling time, evaluate the risk of dry spot formation and examine the effects of various \nprocess parameters on them. Additionally, resin cure kinetics [6] and heat transfer phenomena \n[7,8] have been investigated and modelled, aiming to predict the component behaviour during the \ncure. Modelling has been utilized combined either with inversion techniques as a design \noptimization tool [9] or with measurements as a process control tool [10].  \nThe difficulty in predefining some of the material properties involved in the process does not \nallow the implementation of a complete simulation as production practice at present. Thus, the \nneed to use direct monitoring has arisen. Cure monitoring techniques based on dielectrics and \ninfrared spectroscopy developed in previous composites manufacturing studies have been \nadapted for monitoring the resin cure in RTM processing [11,12]. The monitoring of the filling \nstage has so far focused on visual measurement of the flow front position used in permeability \nestimations [13-15]. Experimental configurations used in these studies involve partially \ntransparent tooling. Therefore they cannot be extended to production or pilot scale moulding. \nSome studies have been carried out on the implementation of automatic non-visual flow \nmonitoring. Dielectric or electric multiple sensing, typically comprising a grid of sensors, has \nbeen used to identify the time of wetting at a specific location [16-18]. Mathur et al [19] have \ninvestigated the application of a flow sensor based on evanescent wave fluorescence, capable of \nlocating the flow front.  \nThe present paper describes the development and application of a novel dielectric sensor with a \ndual monitoring role. During the filling it follows continuously the flow front position and during \nthe cure it monitors globally the progress of the reaction. \n \n2.Sensor Setup \n \n2.1 Description and principle of operation \nThe geometry of the sensor is given in Figure 1. It comprises two parallel flat copper electrodes \nembedded between two layers of a polymeric film.  A very thin layer of adhesive exists between \nthe electrodes and the polymeric film and between the two layers of the polymeric film. Some air \nMeasurement  Science and Technology 11 (2000) 25-31  \nis trapped in the area between the two electrodes. One side of the sensor is covered by metal foil. \nConsequently, when voltage is applied between the two electrodes, electric field is formed only \non one side of the sensor. The semicylindrical field penetrates a portion of the space where the \nfilling of the fabric by liquid resin takes place. \nPolymer\nFilm\nAir\nAdhesive\nElectrode\nMeasurement Space\nwithin the pre-form\n1.5mm\n3.5mm\nMetal Foil\n \nFigure 1. Geometry of the sensor setup, showing the sensor and its placement with respect to the \npre-form. \n \nDuring operation the sensor is aligned parallel to the expected direction of the resin flow front as \nillustrated in Figure 2. The sensing area is divided into two parts, the impregnated by resin \n\u2018wetted\u2019 area and the \u2018dry\u2019 part. As the impregnation progresses the \u2018wetted\u2019 area percentage \nincreases and the \u2018dry\u2019 area percentage decreases. The process is illustrated by the photographs \nshown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3a the sensor, placed on the bottom of the mould, is completely hidden \nby the dry glass fabric. As resin impregnation progresses (Fig. 3b) it becomes possible to see the \nsensor through the wetted part of the fabric. Fig. 3c shows a completely impregnated pre-form, \nwith the sensor visible across the entire length of the mould. Since the electrical properties of the \nliquid resin differ significantly from those of the air, monitoring the evolution of the sensor \ndielectric response can provide quantitative information about the mould filling process. \nMeasurement  Science and Technology 11 (2000) 25-31  \nFurthermore when the filling is completed the sensor can perform macroscopic dielectric cure \nmonitoring. \nDry FabricImpregnated\nArea\nResin Inlet Resin Outlet\n \nFigure 2.

Filling of the RTM mould containing dry glass fabric with RTM6 resin (a) dry glass \nfabric (b) partially wetted (c) fully wetted. The photographs are taken from the top, through the \ntoughened glass top of the mould. \n \n2.3 Analysis of the sensor response \nAnalysis of the electric response can be performed using an electric circuit equivalent to the \nsensor. Each of the previously described components of the sensor contributes an impedance \nelement to the equivalent circuit. In order to establish the component connections, the respective \npotential and current conditions that are imposed on them are considered. Thus, components \nunder the same potential are considered as connected in parallel and components carrying the \nsame current are considered as connected in series.  \nMeasurement  Science and Technology 11 (2000) 25-31  \nThe substrate of the sensor has three components: the polymeric film, the adhesive and the \nentrapped air. The film is connected in series to the adhesive and the resulting element is \nconnected in parallel to the air entrapped between the electrodes, as shown in Figure 4(a). \nConsequently, the total impedance of the substrate per unit length is given by the relation: \n z\nz z z\ns\nf g a\n=\n+ +\n1\n1 1  (1) \nwhere z f , zg  and za represent the impedance per unit length of the film, the adhesive and the \nentrapped air respectively. \nDry\nWetted\nSubstrateFilm\nAir\nAdhesive\nSubstrate\n(a) (b)  \nFigure 4. Circuits representing the electrical response of the sensor (a) substrate circuit (b) \ngeneral circuit. \n \nThe sensor can be considered as a parallel circuit of the wetted and the dry regions. Each of these \ntwo regions can be analysed further into a serial circuit of the substrate and the corresponding \nmeasurement area. According to these the circuit representing the electrical behaviour is the one \nshown in Figure 4(b).  \nIn order to express the total impedance explicitly, it is required to find an expression of the dry \nand the wetted areas impedances as functions of the impedance per unit length and of the length \nof each of them. For this reason we consider a uniform part of the sensor with impedance per unit \nlength z  and length l . If the sensor is conceptually divided into l  parts each of them will be \nconnected in parallel to the rest. Therefore the total impedance will be: \n Z z\nl\n=  (2) \nApplication of that expression to the circuit of Figure 4(b) results in the relation: \nMeasurement  Science and Technology 11 (2000) 25-31  \n Z l\nz z\nl l\nz z\nsensor\nw\ns w\nw\ns d\n=\n+ +\n\u2212\n+\n1  (3) \nwhere l  denotes the total length of the sensor, lw   the length of the covered by resin (i.e. wetted) \npart, zw the impedance per unit length of the wetted part and zd the impedance per unit length of \nthe dry part. \nAlgebraic manipulation of equation (3) leads to the expression: \n Z z z z z z z z\nlz l z lz l zsensor\ns s w s d d w\ns w d w w w\n= + + ++ + \u2212\n2\n (4) \nConsequently the admittance of the sensor is: \n Y l z z\nz z z z z z z\nlz lz\nz z z z z z zsensor w\nd w\ns s d s w w d\ns w\ns s d s w w d\n= \u2212+ + +\n\u239b\n\u239d\u239c\n\u239e\n\u23a0\u239f +\n+\n+ + +\n\u239b\n\u239d\u239c\n\u239e\n\u23a0\u239f2 2  (5) \nIt can be observed that according to equation (5), the admittance is a linear function of the wetted \nsensor length. \nThe two terms in brackets of the linear equation (5) are constant, if the impedances of the \nmaterials involved do not change during the filling. The intercept corresponds to the admittance \nof the dry sensor Ydry . In order to calculate the slope, a measurement of the admittance at some \npoint is required. Moreover, it is observed that the slope is not dependent on the total length of \nthe sensor, so its value is constant for sensors of different lengths in the same molding. Thus \nequation (5) becomes:  \n l\nY Y\nY Y\nlw\nsensor dry\ndry\nt=\n\u2212\n\u2212cov\n (6) \nwhere Ycov  is the measured admittance when length lt  of the sensor is covered by the resin at \ntime t  of the filling stage.  \n \n3.Experimental details \n \nIndividual sensors were fabricated by embedding two flat copper wires between two layers of a \npolymeric film. A single electrode width was 1.5 mm and the interelectrode distance was 0.5 \nmm. The sensor performance was validated during the filling of a glass cavity with silicone oil \nMeasurement  Science and Technology 11 (2000) 25-31  \n(Dow Corning 2000) and during the filling and curing of an RTM6\/glass (non crimped fabric) \nreinforced composite in a partially transparent RTM tool.  \nIn the first case the total sensor length was 27.8 cm and the cavity thickness was 8 mm. The \nfilling was performed at ambient temperature. In the second case the sensor length was 73 cm and \nthe mould thickness 3.3 mm. The filling temperature was 100 oC. Admittance data were gathered \nover a range of frequencies using a Solartron 1260 impedance analyser. Visual determination of \nthe flow front position was recorded against time in both cases. After completion of the filling \nstep the mould temperature was increased to 160 oC to cure the resin.  \nIn order to validate the cure monitoring performance of the sensor, the curing of unreinforced \nRTM6 resin, subjected to an equivalent thermal programme, was monitored using commercial \nGIA microelectrodes [20]. \n  \n4. Results and discussion \n \n4.1. Flow monitoring \nEquation (6) has been used to calculate the flow front position from the admittance data. The \nadmittance measured when the sensor is fully covered by resin has been used as covY . That \nmeans that knowledge of the final measurement was necessary in order to perform the covered \nlength calculation. In a real application where on-line estimation of the flow front position is \nrequired another characteristic length should be used. One possibility is a measurement from an \nadditional short length sensor, which would be fully covered by resin before the wetting of the \nactual sensor commences. Alternatively measurement from the actual sensor can be used, with \nthe field interrupted by electrode screening over a short length at a specific point.    \nIt can be observed from equation (6) that the calculated length is a ratio of two complex numbers. \nIn the ideal case the nominator and denominator of the ratio would be in phase and consequently, \nthe resulting length would be a real number. However, measurement inaccuracies and occurrence \nof phenomena which alter the impedance of the materials involved (e.g. local temperature \nvariations), can cause some phase difference resulting in the existence of an imaginary \ncomponent of the calculated length. \nThe real and the imaginary parts of the wetted length, combined with the visual flow front \nposition measurements, for the filling of the cavity with silicone oil and the filling of the RTM \nMeasurement  Science and Technology 11 (2000) 25-31  \nmold with epoxy resin are illustrated in Figures 5 and 6 respectively. The corresponding \nmeasurement statistics are given in Figures 7 and 8. It can be observed that in both cases the \ncalculated flow front location closely follows the visual observation. The statistical analysis \nshows that there is a correlation between the measured imaginary length and the error in the flow \nfront location. Thus, high values of the imaginary length imply a significant error in the flow \nfront location. In all measurements the imaginary part never exceeded 0.6 cm which is low in \ncomparison with the sensor length; therefore the final accuracy can be considered to be \nsatisfactory.  \n0\n10\n20\n30\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000\nTime (sec)\nR\nea\nl l\nen\ngt\nh \n(c\nm\n)\n-3\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\nIm\nag\nin\nar\ny \nle\nng\nth\n (c\nm\n) Visual\n1 MHz Re\n10 kHz Re\n100 Hz Re\n1 MHz Im\n10 kHz Im\n100 Hz Im\n \nFigure 5.

Logarithm of imaginary \nimpedance is normalized against its minimum and maximum during the cure. \nThe information derived from the two different experiments is similar. During the cure of such a \nsystem the imaginary impedance signal presents a two step pattern. The first step corresponds to \nthe progressing reaction but it is frequency dependent and consequently cannot be identified as a \ncharacteristic point of the cure. The second slight step or \u2018knee\u2019 corresponds to the vitrification of \nthe resin [21]. The time ranges where the first step appears at different frequencies are within 300 \nMeasurement  Science and Technology 11 (2000) 25-31  \nseconds of each other. The vitrification is indicated in both cases approximately 4000 seconds \nafter the beginning of the thermal program. In the microdielectrometry experiment the \nvitrification occurs slightly earlier, therefore the knee  is obscured by the reaction step at low \nfrequencies. During the cure of the component, significant temperature gradients can be expected \nto exist within the sensing region of the global sensor. The microdielectrometry experiment was \nperformed at the temperature representing the bottom layer of the curing component, which is \nhigher than the average temperature in the RTM mould. Therefore vitrification in the \nmicrodielectrometry experiment occurs earlier than in the RTM experiment. \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nA dielectric sensor for measuring resin flow in resin transfer moulding has been developed and \ntested. Equivalent circuit analysis demonstrated the ability for the filling stage of the RTM \nprocess to be monitored through the existence of a linear dependence of the admittance signal, \nmeasured by the presented sensor setup, upon the flow front position. Experiments confirmed \nthat the flow front position can be located continuously with a satisfactory accuracy. In addition, \nthe existence of an imaginary component of the flow front position can be utilized as self-\nassessment tool of the measurement performance. The sensor setup also presented the ability to \nmonitor the cure of the resin after the end of the filling stage. Results from this macro-dielectric \ncure monitoring performed by the sensor were in fair agreement with results from conventional \nmicrodielectrometry experiments.  \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors wish to acknowledge financial support by the EU (Grant No:ERBFMBICT982896) \n(AAS) and The Leverhulme Trust (Grant Ref: F\/509\/G).
