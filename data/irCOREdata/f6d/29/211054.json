After 2000, all teachers were subject to annual goal setting performance \nreviews. Experienced teachers were offered an extended pay scale based on performance \ninstead of seniority, and to gain access to the new upper pay scale, teachers had to go through \na \u2018threshold assessment\u2019 based on their professional skills and performance. This paper \nreports the results of a panel survey of classroom and head teachers which started in 2000 just \nbefore implementation of the new system, and then after one and after four years of operation. \nWe find that both classroom and head teacher views have changed considerably over time, \nfrom initial general skepticism and opposition towards a more positive view, especially \namong head teachers by 2004. We argue that the adoption of an integrative bargaining \napproach to performance reviews explains why a growing minority of schools have achieved \nimproved goal setting, and improved pupil attainments as they have implemented \nperformance management. Pay for performance has been one of the measures of \norganizational support that head teachers could bring to induce changes in teachers\u2019 \nclassroom priorities. We argue that the teachers\u2019 case shows that a wider range of \nperformance incentives than previously thought can be offered to employees in such \noccupations, provided that goal setting and performance measurement are approached as a \nform of negotiation instead of top-down. \n \n \n \n1. Introduction \nIn theory, school teachers should be among the least suitable groups for linking pay to \nperformance. Nevertheless, despite strong initial opposition among teachers and their unions, \nand equally strong scepticism from academic economists (eg. Richardson 1999, Dolton et al. \n2003), the pay for performance system for school teachers in England and Wales, introduced \nin 2000, appears to be gaining acceptance among teachers. In schools where it is practiced \nsystematically, there is evidence that it is leading to improved goal setting, and to faster \nimprovements in pupil performance than in other schools. This article seeks to explain how \nthis came about. In doing so, it argues that we need to broaden current theories linking pay to \nperformance, and consider the way performance is defined, through goal-setting and the \npotential element of individual negotiation in this process. \n 2 \n \nOne of the key limitations of existing theory is that it has focused on a narrow range of types \nof output-based pay, such as for semi-skilled workers, sales staff and senior managers, where \nperformance is more easily measured. In his Journal of Economic Literature review of current \nresearch on the subject, Prendergast (1999) urged us to look beyond such groups for a wider \nunderstanding of pay and incentives for other kinds of employees. In contrast to the former \noccupations, and like many other public service workers, school teachers, of whom there are \nnearly half a million in the UK, have proved a challenge for motivation by conventional forms \nof pay for performance. The nature of their work is \u2018imprecise\u2019. It does not comprise a set of \nwell-defined techniques that have to be consistently applied, and there is, at best, a loose \nrelationship between particular actions and their students\u2019 learning (Murnane and Cohen, \n1986). In this respect, their work could be said to differ fundamentally from that which has \nprovided the strongest demonstrations of how output-based pay can boost performance, such \nas Lazear\u2019s windshield replacers at Safelite (Lazear 1996). Not only is their work \u2018imprecise\u2019, \nbut frequently it involves a range of different kinds of activities, some of which are more \namenable to measurement than others, for example, students\u2019 national test results versus \neducating future citizens. Their work often involves a great degree of interdependency. Even \nif one can isolate an individual teacher\u2019s classroom contribution, which many teachers believe \nimprobable, there remain important areas of team-work within schools (Dolton et al 2003). \nMoreover, the presence of a \u2018collegiate ethos\u2019 (Adnett, 2003) diminishes the likelihood that \nteachers will \u2018shirk\u2019 because their effort is hard to measure, and so reduces the relevance of \none common argument for tying pay to performance. \n \nThus if we were to stick with the conventional forms of output based pay, which as \nPrendergast notes, have been analysed extensively within Personnel Economics, we should \nexpect to find few successful examples of pay for performance in schools. This was indeed \nthe case until fairly recently. Despite a proliferation of schemes in the US in the early \ntwentieth century (Murnane and Cohen,1986), and a long-running scheme in England in the \nlatter part of the nineteenth century (Dolton et al., 2003), pay for performance virtually \ndisappeared from school teaching in both countries for most of the twentieth century. \nTeaching in schools was barren ground for any kind of payment by results, even in private \nschools (Murnane and Cohen 1986). Theory and practice seemed to agree, and the affair was \nclosed. \n \nNevertheless, some characteristics of teachers\u2019 work have meant that the issue never quite \ndisappeared, and in recent years, it has undergone a revival in the US in a number of school \ndistricts with performance pay schemes, in Israel (Lavy, 1999) and in Japan\n2\n. It has done so \nmost dramatically in Britain, where a national scheme, \u2018Performance Management\u2019, was \nintroduced in 2000 in state primary and secondary schools in England and Wales, the subject \nof this paper. \n \nThe reasons for the sustained interest are easy to understand. It is widely accepted that there \nare considerable variations in teacher effectiveness, a point touched on in the British \ngovernment\u2019s recent teacher recruitment campaign \u2018everyone remembers a good teacher\u20193, \nand widely acknowledged by both classroom and head teachers in the first wave of the survey \non which this article is based (Marsden, 2000). Governments have also retained an interest for \nbudgetary reasons. Faced with a need to raise educational standards, and tight restrictions on \npublic spending increases, several national governments have sought to use pay systems more \nactively as an instrument to achieve these ends. Notwithstanding the academic arguments \nagainst performance pay, many educational practitioners have observed the extent to which \n 3 \nexisting pay rules were manipulated in order to recruit and retain, and the perverse effects of \npaying teachers for management activities in order to enhance their pay. It was widely felt too \nthat the then existing salary system was failing to motivate teachers because so many (about \n60%) were stuck on the top pay grade, and was encouraging them to take on additional non-\nteaching duties for more pay which diverted them from the classroom, and so made raising \nstandards even harder to achieve. There was also a feeling in British government circles that \neven though teachers work very long hours during term time, and experience a strong \nprofessional ethos, there were few financial inducements to encourage them to accept the \nchanges in work priorities sought by the government. \n2. The teachers\u2019 performance pay and performance management system \nThe performance management system for state school teachers, introduced by the government \nin 2000, sought to address the need to reward teachers better for excellence in the classroom. \nPerformance management (PM) sought to combine goal-setting and appraisal with \nperformance pay, thus extending the growing practice of other parts of the British public \nservices. It made annual salary progression dependent on performance. The new pay scale \ncomprised two parts. For the lower part, which was, roughly speaking, the old main pay scale, \nthe annual seniority increments were retained, covering roughly the first few years of a \nteacher\u2019s career. Progression to the new \u2018upper pay scale\u2019 required passing the \u2018threshold \nassessment\u2019, based partly on teachers\u2019 professional development, and partly on the progress of \ntheir pupils. Progression along the upper scale was based entirely on performance. There was \nalso provision for accelerated increments for high performers along the lower part of the \nscale. The associated financial rewards could be considerable, potentially taking teachers to \nearnings to 25% above the top of the lower scale, where about 60% of teachers had been \nclustered in 2000. Unlike some private sector bonus systems, the teachers\u2019 performance-\nrelated increments are permanent and count for their pensions. In exchange for the new \nstructure of rewards, all teachers were required to have an annual performance review to set \ngoals and appraise performance, including those on the lower part of the new pay scale. \n \nThe most controversial element of the new performance system has been the concept that \nperformance should include an element of pupil progress. On the whole, teachers, and their \nunions, have been receptive to rewards for improved inputs, such as for improved skills. \nHowever, pupil progress relates to their outputs, and this caused widespread opposition, with \nthe largest of the teachers\u2019 unions opposing it on the grounds that it amounted to payment-by-\nresults. The other unions, which were more supportive of performance review, were also \nstrongly opposed to any form of payment-by-results, and were deeply suspicious that in some \nschools, head teachers would implement this part of the new scheme in a mechanistic fashion. \nAlthough the Education Department provided many \u2018good practice\u2019 illustrations of how pupil \nprogress could applied in a constructive fashion, there was widespread suspicion among \nteachers at the outset that the scheme was really about using performance pay in order to save \nmoney and restrict pay increases to those who toed the line. As will be seen, our study shows \nthat this perception declined over time, but has nevertheless remained a significant under-\ncurrent among teachers. \n \nTo assist implementation, on its website, the Education Department provided schools with \nnumerous examples of good practice concerning how pupil progress could be integrated into \nperformance reviews. Many of these illustrate a problem-solving approach to goal-setting and \nappraisal. One example, which is discussed later in this article, shows the objective setting \npart of the review involved a joint analysis of strategies to tackle a student learning problem, \nhow to improve attainments of boys in a particular subject, and agreement to implement them \n 4 \nduring the year. The next review in the cycle would then assess how successful \nimplementation had been, and the contribution of these strategies to the school\u2019s own goals.  \n \nDespite such positive examples, many teachers, and their unions, feared that practice in \nschools would be rather different. It was feared that pressures on head teachers to raise their \nschool\u2019s academic performance would lead to payment-by-exam-results. One such pressure, \nwhich we explored was that of educational \u2018league tables\u2019. As a result of changes in funding \narrangements and the devolution of greater management autonomy, schools now have to \ncompete to attract pupils who bring funding. Schools which fail to do so, will experience \nfalling numbers and income, and may eventually be closed. A crucial signal to parents in this \nquasi market is provided by comparative tables, league tables, displaying each school\u2019s \nnational exam results. These are publicly available on the Education Department\u2019s website, \nand are frequently published in local newspapers so that parents know which schools are \ngetting more pupils through their exams, and can benchmark them against local and national \nstandards. \n \nA second aspect of diversity among schools in the implementation of performance \nmanagement was suggested to us in an interview with the former head of Cambridge \nEducational Associates,\n4\n the organisation responsible for monitoring implementation of the \nthreshold. From early on, it seemed that some schools had approached performance \nmanagement as a means of improving how schools are run, to achieve better coordination \nbetween teachers\u2019 activity in the classroom and the school\u2019s wider objectives. In contrast, \ninitially at least, the majority of schools were using the new scheme as a means of getting \nwhat was felt to be a long overdue pay increase for teachers, and which should ease staff \nretention problems, especially in high living cost areas such as London. Later on, we \ncharacterise these two strategies as \u2018reformer\u2019 and \u2018firefighter\u2019. This diversity of strategies \nwill make it possible later on to test the effects of the scheme on pupil performance outcomes. \n \n3. The analytical approach: performance management as \u2018integrative\u2019 negotiation \nThe examples of good practice performance reviews provided by the Education Department \ninclude a special feature that is under-developed in the discussions of agency, expectancy, and \ngoal-setting theory: namely a view of goal setting as a problem-solving process. That problem \nis how to align individual employees\u2019 work goals with the changing goals of their \norganisation. In professional work, management is dependent on the knowledge and expertise \nof their staff in order to define appropriate performance goals, and especially, to identify the \nsteps necessary for their achievement. There needs therefore to be an exchange of information \nboth about objectives, to ensure these are realistic, and about the means to reach them. The \nnature of this asymmetry is illustrated from a study by the government\u2019s school inspectorate, \nwhich quoted one teacher from a school with a good appraisal system which included an \nelement of classroom observation: \n \n\u2018My classroom observation (by the head) was useless. For one thing he only came \nonce, and there was no proper feedback. The head was completely out of touch with \nrecent developments in modern language teaching, and so unable to engage in the type \nof debate I hoped for\u2019 (Ofsted, 1996 \u00a715). \n \nThe appraiser in this case lacked knowledge of both the subject and its teaching methods, and \nwould be hard put to \u2018cascade\u2019 objectives top down, and hope that they would be successfully \nimplemented. There may also be disagreements about the goals that constitute performance. \n 5 \nTo what extent should the teacher prioritise exam passes versus developing an understanding \nof, and an affection for, the language being taught, and there might need to be compromise \nfrom both sides in order to sustain commitment to agreed goals. \n \nOne framework for thinking about such processes is provided by what Walton and McKersie \n(1965) describe as \u2018integrative\u2019 bargaining, or negotiation. However, in this case, it would \ntake place at an individual rather than a collective level, between individual teachers and their \nline managers. According to these authors, we should distinguish \u2018integrative\u2019 from \n\u2018distributive\u2019 bargaining, the latter being about shares of the pie, and the former about \nproblem-solving in order to achieve a larger pie. They present four stages or components of \nintegrative bargaining: identifying the problem; searching for alternative solutions; selecting \nthe best alternative; and commitment to implementation. Whereas the first two may seem \nrelatively technical, the third, selection, involves also reference to the preferences of the two \nparties, or as the two authors stress, to their utility functions. The final component brings us \nback to issues of re-contracting and commitment to deliver by both parties. Thus, if \nperformance management is to be seen as involving a significant element of integrative \nbargaining, then one would expect it to show evidence of these components, which will be \nexplored in the empirical part of the paper. However, before that, it is helpful to compare the \nintegrative bargaining approach with other theoretical approaches to the analysis of incentives \nand performance appraisal. \n \nSeveral elements of the process of integrative bargaining are recognised individually by the \nother main theories in the area, but they are not treated together. In discussing the optimal \ndesign of incentives, agency theory deals extensively with issues of monitoring performance, \nand gaining agreement to a mutually satisfactory design of incentives, otherwise the job offer \nwill be rejected. Mostly, the emphasis has been on new hires rather than on negotiation with \nincumbent employees (Prendergast 1999, Tzioumis 2005). Agency theory has also looked at \nissues of renegotiation, particularly in relation to pay when firms are faced with changes in \nmarket conditions, and it has dealt with the problems of \u2018hold-ups\u2019 in such relationships, \nwhereby one party threatens to end the relationship in order to force the other to make large \nconcessions (Gibbons 1998, Malcomson, 1997, Teulings and Hartog, 1998). However, their \nemphasis has been very much upon distributive rather than integrative bargaining, on \nchanging rewards rather than adapting elements of performance. \n \nThe psychological theory of goal setting, as recently reviewed by Locke and Latham (2002), \nhas recognised that participative goal-setting, with an input from employees, often leads to \nbetter results, although the emphasis, as Locke and Latham (2002) observe, has been \nprimarily on information exchange, and to a lesser extent on goal commitment. Expectancy \ntheory emphasises the social exchange between managers and staff, and the need for \nperceived good faith from management in the operation of performance evaluations on which \nperformance pay depends, but on the whole, management are left to determine the nature of \nthe nature of performance and its link with rewards (Furnham, 1997). A third strand of \npsychological theories does consider problems of contracting and breach of perceived \nagreement, namely, \u2018psychological contract\u2019 theory (Rousseau, 1995). For sound \nmethodological reasons, Rousseau rejects the idea that organisations can be party to \npsychological contracts: organisations are not psychological entities. \n \nAn integrative negotiation approach draws on elements of these theories by offering a \nstronger focus on adapting the content and priorities of work performance to changing needs \n 6 \nof the principal, in the light of the expertise and the preferences of the agent, and on the need \nto advance by mutual consent on the basis of give and take by both sides. \n \nThe next section of the paper presents the empirical results. The panel results document the \nchange from initial hostility to performance management among classroom teachers, and also \nmany head teachers, towards declining scepticism about its value among teachers and an \nincreasing belief in its usefulness among school heads. It then looks at performance \nmanagement and head teacher views on its contribution towards improved school \nmanagement, and argues, on the basis of survey replies, that it functions in many schools as \nform of integrative negotiation between school management and classroom teachers. The \narticle then seeks to provide rough estimates of the proportion of schools in the sample which \ncould be said to practice integrative negotiation systematically in performance management, \nand to show that in these schools, pupil attainments in national tests have increased more than \nin other schools. \n \n4. Results \n4.1 The nature of the survey \nThe primary data source for this study is a panel questionnaire survey of classroom and head \nteachers in the same schools conducted at intervals between 2000 and 2004 by the Centre for \nEconomic Performance, and based on a random sample of state schools in England and \nWales\n5\n. It has been carried out in close consultation with the teachers\u2019 unions and \nprofessional organisations and the Education Department. Nevertheless, it is an independent \nstudy. The panel has now completed three waves: the first in February-March 2000, before \nthe new scheme was implemented (see Marsden, 2000); the second in May-June 2001, after \nthe first round of \u2018threshold\u2019 results were known; and the third in May-June 2004, after the \nresults of the fourth round of the system, including potential progression to point 3 on the new \nupper pay scale. For classroom teachers, the questionnaire probes their attitudes and \nexperiences in relation to performance management, and seeks to measure aspects of their \nwork patterns and priorities alongside other variables such as their degree of organisational \ncommitment and their assessment of the working atmosphere in their schools. A copy of the \nquestionnaire used in the first wave can be found in Marsden (2000). For head teachers, it \nasks also about the operation of performance management in their schools, and whether they \nbelieve it has assisted them in their management duties. In addition to the \u2018before and after\u2019 \nelement of the panel, it is possible to link replies from classroom teachers with those of their \nhead teachers, and with other information on their schools concerning the impact of \nperformance management on work patterns, and some educational outcomes based on \nEducation Department\u2019s school performance data. Initially, the panel included replies from \nabout 4,000 teachers and about 1,000 heads. Accounting for sample attrition, it is possible to \nlink replies from about 1,000 teachers and about 300 heads over time through the panel. We \nconducted a number of checks to see whether the panel results reported here differ statistically \nsignificantly from the simple cross-section results for each wave, and found that on the whole \nthey do not. In combining all these different types of information, this study goes much \nfurther than previous UK public service studies, such as those reviewed in the government\u2019s \nMakinson Report (2000), by tracking the same individuals over time, and by combining \nmultiple points of observation and types of data. These studies, which led Makinson to \nconclude that the schemes practised in the British public services were not working, gave no \nindication as to how employee attitudes changed over time, and lacked independent data on \nperformance outcomes, weaknesses the present study has been designed to overcome. \n 7 \n4.2 From initial hostility to increasing acceptance of performance management: 2000-\n2004. \nAs one would expect from the earlier discussion, at the start, teachers were more sceptical of \nthe principle of linking pay to performance and its feasibility in their area of work than other \npublic service employees (see Marsden and French 1998). This is reflected in the first wave \nresponses of both classroom and head teachers in 2000 (see Table 1 below). Initially only a \nfifth of classroom teachers and a third of heads agreed with the principle of linking teachers\u2019 \npay to performance, with comparably low percentages of both groups thinking it could lead to \na fairer allocation of pay, or that it was fair to link pay to pupil progress. Yet, over time, there \nhave been significant increases in support for these views, roughly doubling over the duration \nof the panel. It should be emphasised that these are balanced panel results, tracking \nindividuals who replied to all three waves, and so represent changes of opinion by individual \nteachers. By 2004, between half and two-thirds of heads, and between one and two fifths of \nclassroom teachers had come to accept these principles. \n \nThere have also been equally significant changes in teachers\u2019 beliefs about the \nappropriateness of performance management to teachers\u2019 work. Initially, 90% of classroom \nand 80% of head teachers considered that PM was inappropriate because one could not relate \nthe work done in schools to the performance of individual teachers, a point echoed by the \neconomist critics of the scheme (eg Richardson, 1999, Dolton et al 2003). By 2004, this had \ndropped to 75% among classroom teachers, and to only 44% among school heads. Likewise, \nat the outset over a third of heads thought teachers had too little autonomy in their jobs to be \nable to vary their performance, but this had fallen to under 10% by 2004. Among classroom \nteachers, fears that managers would use PM to reward their favourites, a deep rooted problem \nin other British public sector performance pay schemes, had fallen away from over half in \n2000 to less than a fifth by 2004. Thus, even though many teachers maintained their \nopposition to PM, substantial numbers had changed their assessment of it by 2004. \n \nClosely related to these changes in teachers\u2019 attitudes appears to be the growing perception \nthat goal setting has been working better than initially expected, as 60% of classroom teachers \nand 80% of heads report that management now sets targets more clearly, and among \nsecondary schools in particular, 40% of classroom teachers and 70% of heads say that PM is \nnow used as a means to make staff better informed about objectives within the school. By \n2004, nearly 40% of teachers reported that PM had made them personally more aware of their \nschool\u2019s objectives, the increase being particularly strong in secondary schools. Another \nsignificant change has been the increased perception that PM provides organisational support \nto teachers, helping to identify their professional needs, up from 25% to over 40% between \n2001 and 2004 among class teachers, and up to over 60% among head teachers by 2004. \nAmong head teachers, there has also been modest growth to 45% in 2004 of those who \nbelieve that PM has encouraged teachers to focus on pupil attainments. \n \nNevertheless, the salience of pay has remained strong, and it lends some support to the \nposition of the largest teachers\u2019 union, the National Union of Teachers, that PM is primarily \nabout paying teachers for results, especially in the sense that it represents what its members \nbelieve to be the underlying reality of the scheme. In the first wave, two thirds of classroom \nteachers thought the scheme was \u2018simply a device to avoid giving a pay rise to all teachers\u2019, \nand even after four years of operation, about half of them still believed the scheme was \nbasically about getting more work done. Despite the subsequent evidence of high pass rates, a \nvery high percentage of teachers, and a substantial number of heads, doubt the government\u2019s \ncommitment to continued funding of performance increases, and fear that they will become \n 8 \nvery selective if constrained by school budgets. Initially, and again in 2004, around 80% of \nclassroom teachers believed school budgets would impose a quota on performance pay \nincreases, and even after four years of operation, just under half of all head teachers believed \nthe same. Thus although the unions have pressed hard to ensure that an absolute standard of \nperformance is applied, most teachers believe that budgetary considerations force PM to focus \non relative performance, and restrict rewards to the best performers. \n \nApart from who gets incentive pay, there is also the question of how far teachers value the \nsize of rewards offered. Although there seems to be a stable group of about one third who \nbelieve the new salary levels are too small to make them want to work harder, there has been \na growing minority who disagree, and find the rewards attractive: up from 15% in 2000 to \nnearly 30% in 2004. Thus although other surveys have shown that teachers are not strongly \nmotivated by financial incentives, pay being more a source of discontent than of positive \nmotivation (Vaarlem at al 1992), there is clearly a group of teachers within the sample who \nhave found the new pay scales attractive. An important category among these appears to be \nnew entrant teachers who value the long term prospect of earnings on the extended pay scale \n(Marsden 2000). Finally, a key question for the interpretation of PM in schools is how far \nteachers believe it is operated primarily as a means to ensure teachers get their pay increase. \nThis perception was much stronger among classroom than among head teachers, with around \nfour fifths of classroom teachers holding this view in 2004, but only half of head teachers \ndoing so. This suggests that classroom teachers are keenly aware of the link between \nincreased pay and their performance reviews. Although success rates at both the Threshold \nassessment and upper pay scale progression were extremely high between 2000 and 2004, at \nover 90%, these were known ex post. Ex ante, the results show both a strong consciousness \nthat pay increases require success in the review process, and continuing uncertainty as to \nwhether pass rates will, in practice, be determined by absolute criteria, comparable to a \n\u2018driving test\u2019 as one teachers\u2019 union official described it, or whether they will be constrained \nby a quota or budgetary restrictions. A good measure of the uncertainty in teachers\u2019 minds \nabout the selective nature of the progression linked to performance is shown by their \nresponses between waves to the question about whether performance awards are subject to a \nquota. The second wave took place in spring 2001, just after teachers had been informed of \nthe results of the first round of Threshold assessments. There was a sharp fall, from over 80% \nto less than 30%, in the percentage thinking restrictions would be applied to the number of \nsuccessful applications. However, that percentage bounced back to 80% in the third wave. \nThe reason for this, suggested to us when presenting preliminary results to the teachers\u2019 \nunions, was that the Education Department had floated proposals shortly before the third \nwave that the money available would be capped so that future increases would be constrained \nby school budgets. On that occasion the proposals were withdrawn, but the continued \nuncertainty has meant that teachers believe the scheme has real teeth. Indeed, there was a \nlong-running tension between the government, whose policy is that the scheme should be \nselective, and the unions, which have sought to minimise selectivity.\n6\n \n \nThe head teacher judgements are noteworthy for the decline in numbers who think of PM \nprimarily as a means to get pay increases for their teachers. This was especially true in \nsecondary schools which have more developed management systems than primary schools. \nThis would be consistent with an increased emphasis on using PM as a means of improving \ngoal setting within schools noted earlier on, and is consistent with the point to be developed \nlater on, that the number of schools using PM to reform school management has been \ngrowing. \n \n 9 \nThus, the first impression from these results is that the predicted failure of performance \nreviews and performance pay in schools has not occurred, and that by 2004, there was every \nsign that it was taking root in schools, providing more motivating rewards for a significant \nnumber of teachers. Most important, the procedures for defining the kinds of performance that \nmanagement wanted to achieve were proving moderately effective: goal setting was believed \nto have improved, teachers felt management was providing some support to them as a result \nof PM, and there was an increased awareness of the priority to be given to pupil attainments. \n \n 10 \nTable 1.

The results of the \nbalanced panel mostly differ only slightly from those of the three cross-sections. Scores in the table are weighted \nby sample fractions (smplwt).  \n \n4.3 Performance review in schools as \u2018integrative negotiation\u2019 \nClues as to the reasons for the moderate success of PM by 2004 can be found by looking more \nclosely at the process of performance review that lies at the heart of PM. This section explores \nevidence that, in the best cases, performance reviews have functioned as a form of integrative \nnegotiation of teachers\u2019 work objectives, and notably in the \u2018reformer\u2019 schools. It does so by \nconsidering in turn each of the four stages of integrative bargaining identified by Walton and \nMcKersie. \na) Identifying the problem \nIn the first stage of integrative negotiation, the two parties have to identify the problem which \nbrings together the priorities of the organisation and the capacities and orientations of its \nmembers. In the case of performance review, this means relating the contribution of \nindividual teachers to the wider objectives of the school and their adaptation to new \ncircumstances. \n \nFrom the management side, in recent years, schools have come under a large number of \nexternal pressures which have made their comparative performance with other schools a key \nconcern. This information is easily available to parents of potential pupils, and with the \nfunding changes that attach school funding to pupils, schools compete in a \u2018quasi market\u2019 \n(Glennerster, 2002). The Education Department also benchmarks school performance, and \nthere is also richer and more qualitative information available to all online from government \ninspectors (Ofsted). Within schools, this pressure has become symbolised by the educational \nleague tables of local schools based on comparative academic performance at national tests. \nTo capture this element of pressure on head teachers, we enquired about the influence of \nleague tables on their schools in the third wave. In that, 60% of heads reported increased \nparental pressure as a result of educational league tables. We also enquired about the methods \nused to produce better academic performance in their schools, and notably, whether schools \nsought to learn about educational practices used at comparable schools scoring strongly in \nschool league tables. Fifty percent of teachers, and sixty percent of heads, replied that their \nschools did so. Heads were also asked whether they had shifted resources in response to \nleague table performance issues: 60% reported greater academic content in courses covered \nby tests; 41% that significant resources were devoted to teaching test skills; and 30% reported \nmore resources being provided to test subjects, such as maths, at the expense of other \nsubjects. Thus the mixture of benchmarking and quasi market had generated pressure on \nheads to change priorities and shift resources in their schools. Most schools use a range of \ndecision-making methods to address such issues, but the performance review has a special \nplace because it provides an opportunity for individual-level discussions about individual \nwork objectives and how to relate them to school objectives. \n \nThe results of our survey indicate that classroom teachers enter this process with different \npriorities, which have also been taken up by their unions. For example, when questioned \n 12 \nabout the reasons for the way they allocated their discretionary working time between \ndifferent activities, many teachers emphasised their desire to give a \u2018high quality of \neducation\u2019 as the most important reason, particularly for such activities as lesson preparation \nand feedback. It can also be found in some of the written-in comments. As one classroom \nteacher put it: the new system is based on a \u2018narrow perception of education as measured by \nattainment, whereas schools are also about learning to be members of a community\u20197. Indeed, \nsome heads expressed similar views in their own written-in comments, but it was their job to \nmake the new system work. Thus performance management can be seen as involving a \nprocess of problem identification from two sides, which are not necessarily in opposition to \none another, but they do have distinct points of view which will need to be reconciled. \n \nThe effectiveness of this process is revealed by the growth in the share of both head teachers \nand team leaders\n8\n who believed that PM had made teachers more aware of school objectives, \nboth around 60% by wave 3, and had make teachers think more systematically about their \nwork priorities, both around 50% by wave 3 (Table 2). Many also thought that it had \nincreased the importance of good middle-management in their schools. Given the difficulty \nfor head teachers to be acquainted with the detail of their colleagues\u2019 work except in small \nschools, and their inevitable reliance on this intermediate management level, this suggests that \nin many cases PM has raised awareness of the need to strengthen the linkage between \ndifferent levels of management within schools. \n \n \nTable 2.

Results weighted by sample fractions. \n \nb) Searching for alternative solutions \nThe second stage of integrative negotiation involves identifying strategies for solution, and \nhow to implement them, including support given to teachers by their schools. The survey did \nnot probe directly the search for alternative solutions, but when considered with other sources, \nthere is indirect evidence that this occurs in the best cases. A first source is the good practice \ncase study material provided by the Education Department at the outset, which drew on \n 13 \nexisting practice in some schools, and sought to show others how PM could be used (see Box \n1 below). The spirit of these is to suggest open enquiry in the search for solutions rather than \na strict top-down approach. The Education Department\u2019s guidance stated:  \n \n\u2018Objectives would typically emerge from a discussion between team leaders and \nindividual teachers about the priorities for the coming year and the particular ways in \nwhich the teacher can help the pupils he or she teaches. This might involve targeting \nthe progress of a group of pupils which is not meeting expectations or a small number \nof named pupils. Or it might be a priority to implement new policies or develop \napproaches or techniques which will help pupils to progress e.g. better classroom \nmanagement skills.\u2019 DfEE (1999, p.10) \n \nThus, having identified a problem, the two parties work together to devise a strategy to tackle \nit. The same spirit was illustrated in a number of case studies included in the same document, \nand which fleshed out these general principles. \n \nBox 1: Objective Relating to Pupil Performance: Class Teacher (Year 5) \n \nBackground: Evaluation of optional Year 4 test data and the Year 4 teacher\u2019s own \nassessments shows a clear gender gap in attainment in English and a weakness across the \nclass in writing. In the judgement of the Year 4 teacher, by the end of the year about 60% of \nchildren in the class were not able to do all that the Literacy Framework expects. In his view \nabout 70% of boys fell into this category as opposed to 50% of girls. \nThe objective: by the end of Year 5, to increase substantially the percentage of the class as a \nwhole that will be able to do almost all of what the Literacy Framework states that they \nshould be taught over the year, in writing as well as reading, and to reduce the gender gap \nfrom the present 20%. \nIn discussion: the teacher and team leader might discuss the importance of remedying \nidentified weaknesses in children\u2019s knowledge of spelling conventions, sentence construction \nand punctuation, and teaching strategies known to be helpful for boys such as clear short term \ntargets or use of non-fiction writing exercises. The review meeting would discuss the \noutcomes achieved by the children and review comparative achievement by boys and girls. \n \nSource: DfEE (1999). \n \nOther examples provided by the Education Department include the provision of support to \nteachers to enable the objectives to be achieved, most notably, further professional \ndevelopment to provide additional skills where needed, but they also included other types of \nsupport, as identified in the objective setting process. \n \nAn important part of the search for alternative solutions involves consideration of the means \nrequired for their implementation. Management controls many of these resources, so it is to \nthe head teachers\u2019 replies that one has to turn for evidence of this (Table 3). The questions \nthat comprise the table reflect the factors identified by heads in the first wave as potential \ncauses of variations in the effectiveness of experienced teachers in their schools, and therefore \nwhich are likely to be addressed in the development of new strategies for the school. Thus, we \nasked heads whether PM had enabled them to address some of these problem factors. By \nwave 3, benefits were identified in a substantial minority of cases, between 20 and 35%, the \nmost important being assistance in identifying teachers\u2019 professional development needs, and \nworkload problems. There was a notable increase between the second and third waves for \n 14 \nsome issues. By 2004, 35% of heads in the balanced panel reported that PM had helped them \nidentify and assist teachers whose workload problems might inhibit their performance. \n \nTable 3.

Number of observations: balanced panel 103, and in the cross section, wave 2 c. \n415, and wave 3, c. 290. \nc) Selecting the best alternative:  \nAn important part of integrative negotiation lies in involvement of both parties in selecting the \nbest alternative: otherwise it is hardly a negotiation. Teachers were asked about the conduct of \ntheir own performance reviews. A first test is whether teachers themselves thought the agreed \npriorities reflected the wider objectives of their schools, as in certain key management \ndocuments, such as the School Development Plan (SDP) (Table 4). They might for example \nhave disagreed with the question because they thought the head had imposed some personal \nobjectives unrelated to those of the school, or because the teachers were ignorant of the \nschool\u2019s objectives. In either case, one would conclude that that the resulting solution was not \nseen by both parties as the \u2018best alternative\u2019. Although some of the written-in comments by \nteachers mentioned objectives being imposed on them in their performance reviews, the \nanswers to other questions in Table 4 also confirm that around 90% of teachers felt fully \ninvolved in the process: they had the opportunity to discuss objectives, to influence those \nchosen, and account was taken of their professional needs. Confirming the \u2018golden thread\u2019 \nthat the government established in the scheme, in the great majority of cases, the performance \nreviews included indicators of pupil progress. On this evidence at least, it would seem that \nteachers were involved in the selection of the best alternative strategies to achieve their \nobjectives, and thus participated in the third stage of integrative negotiation.  \n \n 15 \nTable 4.

Not every question was asked in both \nwaves to minimise the demands placed on respondents. \n \nd) Commitment to implementation: \nThe final stage of any integrative negotiation concerns commitment to implementation. A \nnecessary part of this is that objectives should be clear and measurable, that there should be \nverifiable criteria of fulfilment, and an understanding of the monitoring procedures. Without \nthese, the process could easily become an empty exercise. The overwhelming majority of \nteachers (c. 90%) reported that they had clear and measurable objectives, and a slightly \nsmaller percentage said that they understood how progress would be monitored and reviewed, \nand that they were in a position to achieve their objectives (Table 4). They also considered \ntheir objectives were realistic, and nearly all said they had agreed them. As with choosing \nobjectives, so with monitoring, the Education Department gave considerable guidance as to \nhow statistical and other evidence could be used to help define and monitor achievement of \nobjectives. \n \nConsidering these replies at face value, there is a strong case for concluding that integrative \nnegotiation is an important component of performance management as it is practiced in many \nschools. Inspection of the written-in comments underlines this, but it also raises some \nquestions about the significance of the very high level of positive reports. On the positive \nside, one head teacher wrote: \u2018It has helped in the move towards being a self evaluating \nschool and to establish the need for more challenging objectives for staff. The previous \nsystem was \u201ccosy\u201d\u2019, (#30033). In similar vein, another head said: \u2018[PM] has made them more \naware of the need for objective evidence to prove pupil progress\u2019 (#30113). On the negative \nside, some classroom teachers expressed adverse comments, of which one wrote: \u2018PM has \nresulted in teachers doing more admin, tasks analysis, statistical work and less time given to \ncreating interesting vibrant lessons\u2019, (#20888). \n \nOne explanation of such divergent written-in views, apart from their relatively small number \ncompared with the main replies, is that head teachers had a somewhat different perception of \nperformance management than their classroom teachers. For the former, PM involved use of \n 16 \ndata and other materials to diagnose problems faced by their schools. For the latter, in schools \nwhere the message had not been well communicated, statistical data were irrelevant to the \ntask of \u2018creating interesting vibrant lessons\u2019. One measure of whether PM was mere form-\nfilling and agreeing a paper exercise lies in the extent to which both head and classroom \nteachers share the view that PM has led to improved goal setting in their schools. Where \nclassroom teachers experience PM as a lot of meaningless statistics they are unlikely to have \nbeen involved in the problem-solving dimension of goal-setting. To this we now turn. \n \n5. Instrumentality of PM in linking classroom teacher and school-wide objectives  \nIntegrative negotiation requires two parties, and so it is important to demonstrate that the \nschools in which this was best developed were also those in which teachers had greater \nawareness of school objectives. This requires a linking of replies from classroom and head \nteacher. Ideally, we should compute average scores for teacher awareness of objectives in a \nparticular school, and then compare these with the judgements of the head teacher on the \nquality of the different stages of integrative negotiation within the performance review \nprocess. Unfortunately, the response rate across schools was too variable, and so we tackle the \nquestion the other way round: whether the teachers who said PM had made them personally \nmore aware of their school\u2019s objectives were working in schools in which the heads reported \nthat PM was effective? Although there appears to have been a considerable improvement in \nthe operation of PM between waves 2 and 3, we limit this analysis to wave 2 because it \ncontained a wider range of descriptive questions to head teachers about the conduct of \nperformance reviews. \n \nTo gauge the quality of performance reviews as judged by the head teachers, we conducted a \nfactor analysis which boiled eighteen questions down to three dimensions: whether PM had \nled to clearer goals being set; whether objectives were agreed to by teachers in their schools; \nand whether the school provided support, such as for professional development. These three \nindexes were then included in an ordered probit regression on classroom teacher replies as to \nwhether their performance review had raised their awareness of school objectives. The latter \nvariable included a five point scale from disagree strongly to agree strongly. We also included \nsome descriptive questions from the teacher questionnaire relating to aspects of their \nperformance reviews, plus a set of control variables. The results are shown in Table 5. \nAlthough the pseudo r-squared is low, it is statistically significant at the 0.1% level. The \nimportant conclusion from the table is that when head teachers judge performance \nmanagement to provide clearer goals and, that those goals are agreed, classroom teachers are \nmore likely to report that it has increased their awareness of their school\u2019s objectives. \nLikewise, classroom teachers are more likely to find PM increases their goal awareness when \nthe performance review is carried out systematically, when there are specific and clear goals, \ntheir own needs are taken into consideration, and when they see their school using PM to \ninform and to support its teachers. \n \n 17 \nTable 5.

Robust standard errors used. \nControl variables on teacher and school characteristics included dummies if female, aged over 30, part-time, had \na degee, union member, secondary school, and number of school pupils. Of these, only \u2018secondary school\u2019 was \nsignificant, at 0.1%, with a coefficient of -0.3. \nPseudo R2=0.045, prob = 0.000 Wald chi2=158.7, n=1699. Data analysed using STATA 9. Factor analysis of \nhead teacher views was based on an analysis of 18 variables on different aspects of PM in their schools. These \nscores have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of unity. The variables were adjusted by setting missing \nvalues to neutral values to ensure the regression was based on full coverage of the response for wave 2. Total \nteacher response in wave 2: 1792, used replies in regression: 1699. \n \n \nA slightly different angle on the same question is provided by examining the degree to which \nhead teachers, the school leadership group and classroom teachers all share the view that PM \nhas caused goal setting to become clearer and more effective in their schools. Again the \nmotivation for this analysis is that a consistent set of views is much more likely if goal setting \nis being run systematically in a school, and in a spirit of integrative negotiation. If the spirit is \nall \u2018take\u2019, or that goals are imposed on teachers, or just that heads have unrealistic views \nabout how the process is running in practice in their schools, then one would expect no \nrelationship between head, leadership group and classroom teacher views. In the absence of a \ncoordinated approach, individual teachers may have good or bad experiences with their \nindividual department heads, but these would not be consistent within the same school. On the \nother hand, if there is coordination, one would expect the views of these three groups to \nconverge. \n \nWe approach this issue by combining a number of questions to head teachers on the \ncontribution of PM in their schools to more effective goal setting, and computing an index \nbased on a factor analysis, and then tabulating these against classroom teacher judgements \nabout goal setting. This provides an indication of the degree to which the two sets of \njudgements coincide (Table 6, Panel A). Being a factor score, the mean is zero and the \nstandard deviation is unity, so that roughly two thirds of cases should lie in the range between \nplus and minus one. Thus, a positive score for school \u2018x\u2019 indicates that the strength of the \nhead\u2019s assessment of goal setting is above the average for schools in the sample. Thus in \nPanel A, we observe that in schools where classroom teachers agree strongly that PM has \n 18 \nimproved goal setting, the heads\u2019 scores are also above average and in the positive direction \n(at 0.439), indicating a convergence of their views. Conversely, in the schools where the \nteachers judge PM has not improved their awareness of school goals, we observe lower scores \nfor the head teacher assessments. Thus, as with the ordered probit analysis, we find evidence \nthat, where heads report PM as working effectively, so too do classroom teachers. \n \n \nTable 6.

Cells show factor scores for head teacher replies \nin these schools, waves 2 and 3 combined. Mean zero, standard deviation of unity. \n \nWe are able to take this a step further by examining how far both head teachers and the \nleadership group (departmental heads and team leaders) coincide in their assessments of the \neffect of PM on goal setting for classroom teachers (Table 6 Panel B). This is more a measure \nof consistency of view within the managerial hierarchy in schools. One would expect to find \nsuch consistency in schools in which integrative negotiation is a part of PM, which is shown \nby the rising value of the head teachers\u2019 index as we move towards schools where the \nleadership group has a positive assessment of PM. \n \nFinally, we turn to the relationship between heads\u2019 judgements of the effectiveness of goal \nsetting and class teachers\u2019 reports concerning the content and conduct of PM in the same \nschools. As already mentioned, pupil progress has been the litmus test for the government as \n 19 \nto whether or not \u2018performance\u2019 is real. As can be seen in Table 7, in schools where head \nteachers judge PM to be effective, classroom teachers are more likely to report a continued \nemphasis on pupil progress within PM. Secondly, echoing the element of organisational \nsupport to teachers where PM has been well-implemented, teachers are more likely to be \nconfident that merit will be rewarded \u2013 \u2018all good teachers\u2019 can expect to progress on the upper \npay scale. Finally, reflecting the external pressures on school management, it is notable that \nwhere head teachers report effective goal setting, class teachers report that their school \nactively benchmarks its educational practices on other good-performing schools. \n \nTable 7.

All class teachers combined. \n \n6. How many schools have adopted the \u2018reformer\u2019 strategy? \nBy now it is clear that behind the general picture of growing acceptance and increasing \npositive assessment of PM shown in Table 1, there is considerable diversity in the way in \nwhich the national scheme has been implemented in individual schools. Thus there would \nseem to be schools where it is quite reasonable to accept the PM has functioned like a process \nof integrative individual-level negotiation, whereas in others, this seems to be far from the \ncase. This diversity was reflected in some of the written-in comments. One teacher wrote: \n\u2018Teachers feel obliged and pressurised into making unrealistic targets at the beginning of the \nyear which they then cannot fulfil during the year\u2019 (\u2018#833 T-W2). On the other hand, one \nhead wrote in: \u2018PM has improved the positive attitude to professional development and self-\nimprovement within the overall picture of school improvement\u2019 (#60162 H-W2). \n \nThere will clearly be a large grey area of PM practice in between the cases of imposed goals \nand those where there is a real spirit of negotiation. Therefore, a precise allocation of schools \ninto one or other category is impossible and any measure has to be taken with a grain of salt. \nAs schools change over time, so the manner in which they apply PM may also evolve. \nTherefore it is better to talk of strategies adopted by schools, and which may change, rather \nthan to seek to characterise individual schools. Thus, a first strategy, hinted at earlier on is the \n\u2018reformer\u2019 strategy, where the school seeks to use PM as an opportunity to improve \nmanagement and to use goal setting to improve coordination within the school. On the other \nhand, the \u2018fire-fighter\u2019 strategy groups two broad approaches: to use PM to get teachers their \npay rise, and so reduce staff recruitment and retention problems; and to use PM to impose \ntargets on teachers in an attempt to raise performance. Both of these are likely to be driven by \ncrises. A school may well switch strategies, from being a \u2018fire-fighter\u2019 to being a reformer, for \nexample, once retention problems have been resolved, and there is time to move on to other \nissues. \n \n \n 20 \nTable 8.

The leadership group values relate to those who agreed that PM had improved \ngoal setting in their schools, as did the class teacher question. Members of the leadership group were \nidentified from the biographical data obtained in the first wave. The number of observations in the \npanel was reduced by the need to have responses from both heads and the relevant group of classroom \nteachers for each school.\n9\n  \n \n \nOne way to identify the \u2018reformer\u2019 strategy might be to enquire whether goal setting is \nintegrated within a school, and in the spirit of the previous discussion, to explore whether \nboth classroom and head teachers\u2019 agree PM has improved goal setting in their schools. We \ncharacterise schools with the \u2018reformer\u2019 strategy as those in which head teachers give above \naverage scores using the index of goal setting quality in Tables 5 and 6, and where the \nclassroom teachers agree it has improved goal setting. On these rough and ready estimates, we \nmay characterise between 15% and 25% of schools in the sample as pursuing the \u2018reformer\u2019 \nstrategy (Table 8). This can be seen in the top row, which uses the largest number of \nobservations available by pooling responses for 2001 and 2004. A similar analysis was carried \nout for the other indicator used in the earlier tables, namely, whether PM had increased one\u2019s \npersonal awareness of school targets. The effects were somewhat smaller, but so too was the \nnumber of positive replies to that question. These estimates are consistent with those of early \ncase studies by Wragg et al (2001), and by Mahoney et al. (2003), who found modest effects \nof the new system in changing how teachers perform. However, what these early studies \ncould not capture is the growth in the number of schools adopting the \u2018reformer\u2019 strategy. \nEven though the small numbers of effective observations beckons caution, whichever measure \nis used, there has been an increase of about ten percentage points in such schools: from 10-\n 21 \n20% in 2001 to 20-30% in 2004. The growth in the numbers of \u2018reformer\u2019 schools was \nconfirmed by computing a transition matrix between such schools in 2001 and 2004, which \nshowed strong movement from \u2018fire-fighter\u2019 schools in 2001 into the \u2018reformer\u2019 category in \n2004, with only small number of moves in the opposite direction. Thus, one can say that the \nnumber of schools adopting the \u2018reformer\u2019 strategy has increased quite strongly since the \ninception of the new system. \n \n7. School performance \nFinally, we turn to effects of PM on school performance as reflected in the government\u2019s \nleague table performance indicators. It is impossible to test whether the new system has led to \nimproved pupil results for the whole country because there are too many other factors at \nwork. However, it is possible to examine whether the schools which implemented \nperformance management most thoroughly achieved greater improvements in their results \nthan those which did not. Comparing improvements in goal setting with improvements in \nacademic performance over time across schools enables us to factor out many of the possible \ncompeting variables. It should be added that national tests are externally assessed so that \nalthough there has been debate about grade inflation across the system as a whole, the scope \nfor any individual schools to inflate their grades is small. It is quite likely that using a relative \nmeasure understates the possible full effect of PM on school performance, but we have no \nsimple way of adjusting for the unknown amount of general grade inflation. \n \nTo gauge these we take changes in the academic results of schools at Key Stage 2 (age 10) for \nprimary schools, and for GCSE\n10\n (age 15) for secondary schools (Table 8). We identify those \nschools which improved their relative academic performance as reflected in the results for \nschool years ending 1999-2000 and 2002-2003, and compare this group with those reporting \nan improvement in goal setting between waves 2 and 3. The sample numbers of those \nchanging between waves 2 and 3 are quite small, so the results can be only tentative, but we \nfound a positive and statistically significant relationship: schools whose heads report \nimprovements in goal setting were more likely also to have improved their academic results. \n \nTable 8. Goal setting and school performance \n \n(Column %) Improved relative academic performance at school \nImproved use of goal setting in school No Yes \nNo 53 40 \nYes 47 60 \n   \n Chi^2 3.1 \n P 0.079 \nNote:  table shows changes between waves 2 & 3. \nNote:  goal-setting factor score as in Tables 5 and 6. Based on the 169 observations for schools that could be \nmatched. \n \nConfidence in these results is boosted by similar findings by researchers at the CMPO, Bristol \nUniversity, using a completely different methodology, which show a positive effect of \nthreshold assessment on the academic performance of pupils in classes taught by eligible \nteachers (Atkinson et al. 2004). The CMPO study examines the change in academic \nachievements of pupils in classes taught by teachers who were, or were not, eligible to pass \nthe Threshold. They found that pupils with teachers eligible to pass the Threshold were more \nlikely to improve their performance. Although the CMPO study emphasises the financial \n 22 \nincentive of passing the threshold, their evidence is consistent with this paper. Their statistical \nresults could equally well derive from improved goal-setting as opposed to simple financial \nincentive. Although the findings of our own study suggest that most teachers are not strongly \nmotivated by the extra financial rewards offered, it is clear that going through the threshold \napplication procedures would make them more amenable to focusing on the goals agreed with \ntheir head teachers. \n \n8. Conclusions  \nThis paper has shown that despite initial academic scepticism and the hostility of many \nteachers and their unions, performance management had, by 2004, taken root in many state \nschools in England, and was contributing to improved goal setting. Although such schools \nwere still in the minority by 2004, in those where PM had become well established, it had also \ncontributed to improved pupil performance. The reason the initial academic scepticism was \nmisplaced was that insufficient account was taken of how the problems of performance \ndefinition and monitoring could be resolved by appropriate goal-setting measures. This \nsuggests that if we are take up Prendergast\u2019s challenge to look at performance incentives \nacross a wider range of occupations, we need to give more consideration to mechanisms for \ndefining and agreeing performance goals. \n \nAlthough some of the leading exponents of goal setting theory have systematically \ndownplayed the importance of financial incentives (e.g. Locke and Latham, 1990), they have \nassumed a key supporting role in the teachers\u2019 case. For teachers, the link with pay has been \nof central importance. At one level, it was the \u2018bribe\u2019 to gain acceptance for the new system: \nno performance management, no large pay increase. But there is also a sense in which it has \nfunctioned as performance related pay, and so contributed to the negotiation between school \nmanagement and classroom teachers. Heads can decide who to put forward for the Threshold \nassessment, and they can choose when to propose their colleagues for movement along the \nupper pay scale. The evidence from a teacher\u2019s performance review is one of the key items in \nthe submissions for pay progression. Up until the time of the latest wave, in practice, and ex \npost, success rates at the Threshold and for upper pay scale progression have been very high, \nand some have argued it is virtually automatic. However, this is to miss the power heads have \nto advance or postpone proposals for upper pay scale advancement, and the impact of the \nlong-running uncertainty over central government funding for performance increases. Ex post \nthe pass rates may be high, but ex ante, in the eyes of most teachers and their heads, according \nto the evidence of the CEP surveys, the outcome is uncertain. It is surely the ex ante prospect \nthat drives behaviour rather than the ex post knowledge. \n \nThe link with pay introduces another element, namely that of negotiation. It has been argued \nin this paper that an appropriate framework for considering the effective cases of goal setting \nwithin PM is that of integrative negotiation. The rates of pay are fixed by national pay scales, \nand schools are constrained by Education Department rules as to how they allocate their \nbudgets. Nevertheless, putting a teacher forward for the Threshold or for upper pay scale \nprogression earlier rather than later is one of the measures of organisational support available \nto head teachers when trying to work out solutions to the kind of problems that are the focus \nof PM: alignment of individual and collective goals, and renegotiating work priorities. Walton \nand McKersie were careful to retain a reference to the parties\u2019 utility functions within their \nanalysis of integrative bargaining. Problem-solving has perhaps always a technical \ncomponent, but the chosen solution nearly always also affects the welfare of both parties. \nPutting a teacher forward for progression is one of the elements of support alongside \n 23 \nprofessional development, and adjustment of inappropriate workloads that can be used to help \npersuade individual teachers to adjust their work priorities to those needed by their schools. \n \nCould this be achieved without the link with pay? A previous Conservative government \nintroduced a national teacher appraisal scheme in 1991, yet it was not widely implemented in \npractice (Ofsted, 1996), and what was left of it was replaced in 2000. In contrast, PM has \nbeen almost universally implemented, and as shown in the CEP surveys, its design in most \nschools, as concerns written objectives and so on, follows the key Education Department\u2019s \nguidelines. Although it is difficult to probe in this survey, there are signs of important \ndifferences between the \u2018fire-fighter\u2019 schools which have just used PM as a form-filling \nexercise to get teachers their pay increase, and the \u2018reformer\u2019 schools. The former dissociated \nthe two processes, and have paid the price as PM appears to have been less effective than in \nthe \u2018reformer\u2019 schools, and arguably less beneficial in terms of pupil attainments. \n \nOne piece of evidence that would have helped to clinch the argument about changing \npriorities and practices by classroom teachers as a result of PM was lost in the course of the \nsurvey. It had been hoped to track how teachers allocated their discretionary time, this being \nconsidered a better measure than questions about changes of priorities and practices. \nUnfortunately for the study, measurement of this variable was disturbed by conflicts over \nteachers\u2019 working hours, and government action to \u2018remodel\u2019 teachers\u2019 working time. It also \nproved impossible to capture teachers\u2019 working time use at the same point in the school year \nwhile at the same time surveying attitudes at the same point in the performance management \ncycle. As a result, there proved to be too much \u2018noise\u2019 in this key variable. Nevertheless, we \nknow from the replies of head teachers that many of them have shifted resources and teaching \npriorities towards more academic and test subjects in response to league table pressures, and \nthese are more likely to include \u2018reformer\u2019 schools. With this, the good practice examples of \nperformance reviews, and the evidence of improved pupil attainments in \u2018reformer\u2019 schools, \nwe can infer that many teachers have adjusted their work priorities as a result of performance \nmanagement where it has been well run. \n \nBy the time of the last wave in 2004, it was clear that effective performance management was \nspreading as a result of more schools adopting a systematic approach rather than diffusing \nevenly by the same amount across all schools. Hence the interest in identifying those with the \n\u2018fire-fighter\u2019 and \u2018reformer\u2019 strategies, and tracking those that switch. Adopting the \u2018reformer\u2019 \nstrategy opens up not just a one-off change in performance for the school, but rather provides \nit with the means of addressing continuously changing priorities. Professional groups may \nbring a high degree of motivation by virtue of their professional ethos, but that can also prove \nconservative in the face of such changes. The cases of systematic performance management \nsuggest that by approaching goal setting as a form of integrative negotiation, a way is opened \nto addressing changing school priorities on a long-term basis. Recognising this is important, \nbecause professional groups, such as teachers, bring expert knowledge to their work that is \nnot always accessible to management. Even when the manager is another teacher, there may \nbe differences in subject knowledge and teaching methods, so that it is hard to identify and \nimpose top down new objectives and the strategies to achieve them. Approaching the process \nas one of integrative negotiation enables both parties to engage in a dialogue on their \nrespective objectives, the means to achieve them, and the measures of organisational support \nneeded. In such cases, agreement to goals is arguably the more appropriate means of gaining \ncommitment to fulfil them. \n \n \n 24 \n9. References \n \nAdnett, N.

In small \nschools with under 35 teachers, every teacher was sent a questionnaire, and in larger ones, heads \nwere asked to select every nth teacher off the school\u2019s staff list depending on the size of the school. \nHeads were asked to complete a special questionnaire. Being a panel study, the initial respondents \nto wave one were approached again for waves two and three. \n \nThe overall response rate to the first wave was about 20%, which comprises a double response: \nwhether the head teacher agreed to distribute the questionnaires in the first place, and then whether \nthe teachers themselves chose to reply. In many schools, head teachers have a policy of not \ndistributing questionnaires in their schools in order not to add to the workload on their teachers. \n \nInitially, the panel included replies from about 4,000 teachers and about 1,000 heads. Accounting \nfor sample attrition, it is possible to link replies from about 1,000 teachers and about 300 heads over \ntime through the panel. We conducted a number of checks to see whether the panel results reported \nhere differ statistically significantly from the simple cross-section results for each wave, and found \nthat on the whole they do not. \n \nThe questionnaire used for classroom teachers and for head teachers in Wave 3 can be found in \nMarsden and Belfield (2005b). That for wave 1 can be found in Marsden (2000).  \n \n"}
