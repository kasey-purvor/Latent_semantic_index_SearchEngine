INTRODUCTION\nW ITH FURTHER advances of organic light-emitting-diode (OLED) display technologies toward even higher\nimage quality, higher efficiency, lower power consumption,\nand larger size, the active-matrix architecture, which integrates\nOLEDs with thin-film-transistor (TFT) circuits in each display\npixel, has become the technology of choice [1]. Compared with\nthe voltage-mode driving methodology, the current-mode one\nhas advantages such as improved display spatial uniformity,\ngood environmental immunity, excellent linearity, and proven\nlong-term stability [2], and thus, it is preferred for high-\nperformance active-matrix OLEDs (AMOLEDs). To realize\ncurrent-mode AM driving, the switched-current (S-I)-type\npixel circuits were developed to control and drive the OLED\nelements [3], [4]. The long-time and signal-dependent settling\nproblems in the S-I pixel circuits can be solved to meet the\nvideo bandwidth requirements by using current-scaling [5], [6],\ncurrent-feedback [7], or hybrid driving approaches [2]. How-\never, the S-I pixel circuits are based on the sampling and hold\n(S\/H) operations and, thus, suffer the S\/H nonidealities, which\ndepend on the circuit\u2019s parameters and the input signal level [8].\nThe resultant signal-dependent S\/H errors can deteriorate the\ncurrent-reproducing accuracy and the output linearity of the\ncircuits. In this letter, a simple and effective capacitive com-\npensation method is proposed and analyzed to suppress the S\/H\nnonidealities.\nManuscript received May 31, 2007.

OLED model current\u2013voltage characteristics obtained via a macro-\nmodeling approach [11] being fitted to the experimentally measured results of\nan inverted top-emitting OLED structure [10] used in this letter.\nII. SIMULATION SETUP\nTo analyze and verify the proposed design, Simulation\nProgram with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) circuit sim-\nulations with the commercial circuit simulator HSPICE vended\nby Synopsys are performed [9]. The electrical characteristics\nof an efficient inverted top-emitting OLED structure [10] are\nintegrated into the SPICE simulations by using a macromod-\neling approach [11], which models the current\u2013voltage char-\nacteristics by directly specifying the experimentally measured\ndata points with the 1-D piecewise linear function in SPICE [9],\nas shown in Fig. 1. Because the experimental data are directly\ninput into the model, the model can reproduce the real electrical\ncharacteristics of the device with no deviations.\nThe basic configuration of an n-type TFT S-I pixel circuit\nis shown in Fig. 2(a), which is designed for the inverted\ntop-emitting OLED structures. Adopting top-emitting OLED\nstructures removes limitations in the optical transparency of\nbackplanes and the filling factor of traditional bottom-emitting\nOLED pixels. The inverted OLED structure technology is\nalso somewhat preferred because for amorphous-silicon (a-Si)\nTFTs, which are often used in large-scale AMOLEDs where\nonly n-type transistors are available, lower power can be\nachieved, while for polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) TFTs,\nn-type TFTs usually have higher carrier mobility and, thus,\nlower operation voltage [12]. In the following, this n-type\npoly-Si TFT pixel circuit for the inverted OLED structure,\nas shown in Fig. 2(a), will be taken as an example for the\nanalysis. Furthermore, due to similar operation mechanisms,\nthe analysis procedure is also applicable for the a-Si TFT pixel\n0741-3106\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The\npoly-Si TFT simulation model parameters are extracted based\non the widely accepted Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute poly-\nSi TFT model [9] from the measurements. Values of the two\nmain parameters\u2014threshold voltage (Vth) and effective carrier\nmobility (\u00b5e\ufb00)\u2014are the following: Vth = 1.25 V and \u00b5e\ufb00 =\n128 cm2\/V \u00b7 s. The storage-capacitor value (CS) is 0.2 pF.\nThe channel width and length of the TFTs are the following:\n(W\/L)MS = 10 \u00b5m\/15 \u00b5m, (W\/L)M1,M2 = 20 \u00b5m\/5 \u00b5m,\nand (W\/L)M3 = 20 \u00b5m\/10 \u00b5m. The whole pixel area is 100\u00d7\n300 \u00b5m.\nIII. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONS\nThe operation of the SI pixel circuits can be divided into\ntwo phases: sampling and hold. For the circuit, as shown\nin Fig. 2(a), during the sampling phase, the video signal is\nconverted to a current signal Idata, then it is sampled into the\ncurrent-sink transistor (MS) during row selection; during the\nhold phase, MS reproduces and holds the current signal to\ndrive the lighting element. Theoretically, the modulated OLED\ncurrent IOLED is equal to the input data current. However, in a\nrealistic case, the finally modulated emission current IOLED is\ngiven by [8]\nIOLED =\n(\u221a\nIdata \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03b2MS \u00b7\u2206VMSgs\n)2\n+ \u03bb \u00b7\u2206VMSD (1)\nwhere \u03b2MS is the transconductance factor of MS ; \u2206VMSgs and\n\u2206VMSD are, respectively,MS\u2019s gate stored voltage and the drain\nvoltage shift that occurs when the pixel operation changes from\nthe sampling phase to the hold phase; and \u03bb is a constant\nassociated with the channel-length modulation and the kink\neffects of the poly-Si TFTs.\nEquation (1) shows that the presence of \u2206VMSgs and \u2206VMSD\nmay cause deviation of IOLED from Idata. By using a long-\nchannel TFT, \u03bb can be minimized, and thus, the effects from\n\u2206VMSD may be suppressed. Moreover, the main problem for\nthe pixel circuit that causes the deviation of IOLED from Idata\nis\u2206VMSgs due to charge injection and clock feed-through effects\nof M1. In normal S\/H circuit design, such switch effects are\npossible to be partially cancelled by using large storage capac-\nitance (CS), by adding a dummy transistor [14], or by using\na CMOS transmission gate instead of the n-type TFT switch\nFig. 3. (a) Variations of theMS \u2019s gate-source voltage VMSgs and drain-source\nvoltage VMSD when the pixel circuit in Fig. 2(a) shifts from sampling phase to\nhold phase (Idata = 2.5 \u00b5A):\u2206VMSgs,M1 is the falling part due to the charge in-jection and clock feed-through effects onM1, \u2206VMSgs,cp is the rising part due to\nMS \u2019s drain-to-gate coupling, and \u2206VMSD is MS \u2019s drain-source voltage varia-\ntion. (b) Similar variation trends of \u2206VMSgs,M1 and \u2206V\nMS\nD with an increase of\nIdata for the pixel circuit.\n[15]. However, in the pixel circuit design, the dimension of CS\nis limited by the pixel layout area, and large CS may also slow\nthe sampling operation. In addition, both the latter two methods\nincrease the pixel complexity with the addition of a TFT and\nwith the additional input pulse signals.\nIn this letter, a simple approach by adding a small compensa-\ntion capacitance CF between MS\u2019s gate and drain is introduced\nto solve this problem, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The operation of\nthis method is explained as follows.\nAs shown in Fig. 3(a), \u2206VMSgs is composed of two parts:\nthe falling part \u2206VMSgs,M1 due to the charge injection and clock\nfeed-through effects on M1 and the rising part \u2206VMSgs,cp due to\nMS\u2019s drain-to-gate capacitive coupling. When the pixel circuit\noperation changes from the sampling phase to the hold phase,\nthe increase of VMSD will be coupled to the gate with the\nparasitic drain\u2013gate capacitance Cgd and, thus, will cause an\nincrease of VMSgs with a certain amount of \u2206VMSgs,cp, which can\nbe expressed as\n\u2206VMSgs,cp =\n\u2206VMSD \u00b7 Cgd\nCS + Cgd\n(2)\nwhere Cgd is the total capacitance between MS\u2019s gate\nand drain.\nFig. 3(b) shows the signal dependence of both \u2206VMSD and\n\u2206VMSgs,M1 and also their similar change trends with the increase\nof input data current. Since \u2206VMSgs,cp is proportional to \u2206V\nMS\nD ,\nif choosing a suitable Cgd with a given CS , \u2206VMSgs,cp can\neffectively counteract \u2206VMSgs,M1 over the whole range of Idata.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Plots showing the greatly improved current-reproducing accuracy and\noutput linearity of the S-I pixel circuit with the addition of a CF of 0.01 pF\nbetween MS \u2019s gate and drain. The obtained IOLED standard-deviation error\nvalues of the pixel circuit with and without the addition of a CF show the\npresence of CF that does not cause much degradation of IOLED\u2019s uniformity.\nFor the self-aligned TFT technology used in this letter, the gate-\nto-drain overlap capacitance is nearly zero. If we add a larger\ncompensation capacitanceCF between the gate and the drain of\nMS , then there will be Cgd \u2248 CF . Therefore, it is possible to\ncontrol the value of \u2206VMSgs,cp through modulating CF , so that\n\u2206VMSgs,M1 might be effectively reduced over the whole range\nof Idata.\nThe value of CF is determined based on (2) and the ratio be-\ntween the \u2206VMSD and the \u2206V\nMS\ngs,M1\n, as shown in Fig. 3(b). With\nCS = 0.2 pF, a CF of 0.01 pF is chosen to make Cgd\/(CS +\nCgd) \u2248 1\/20; thus, \u2206VMSgs,cp can roughly counteract \u2206VMSgs,M1\nover the whole range of Idata. Fig. 4 shows the simulated\nOLED current IOLED as a function of the input data current\nIdata without CF and with a CF of 0.01 pF, respectively.\nDue to the signal-dependent S\/H nonidealilities, the actual\nIOLED versus Idata characteristics of the conventional S-I pixel\ncircuit without adding a CF present a significant linearity error\ncompared to the ideal case.\nBy adding a CF of 0.01 pF between MS\u2019s gate and drain,\nthe S\/H nonidealilities are effectively suppressed, thus greatly\nimproving the current-reproducing accuracy and the output\nlinearity of the pixel circuit. CF can be easily fabricated by\nusing the gate and the drain of MS as the two electrodes, and its\nvalue is much smaller than that of theCS , which is 0.2 pF in this\nletter. Furthermore, this method does not need to use a large CS\nto reduce the \u2206VMSgs , and the final overall area for capacitors\ncan be smaller than that in conventional design. Therefore, the\npixel aperture ratio and resolution will not be affected with\nthe addition of a CF . The ratio of CF to CS provides another\nadjustable parameter for optimizing the pixel circuit with given\ndesign specifications.\nThe effects of adding a CF on the modulated OLED current\n(IOLED) uniformity of the S-I pixel circuit are also examined.\nTo predict the IOLED\u2019s uniformity influenced by the device\nprocess, Monte Carlo statistical circuit analysis was performed.\nIn the analysis, Gaussian statistical distribution functions are\nadopted for modeling fluctuations of all related process and\ndevice parameters in the circuit [12]. Twenty percent of relative\nvariations is assumed for the device physical model parameters\nincluding threshold voltage (Vth) and effective carrier mobility\n(\u00b5e\ufb00). Ten percent of relative variations is assumed for the\nprocess-induced fluctuations including device length and width\n(W,L), gate oxide thickness (tox), and capacitor values (CS\nand CF ). Fig. 4 shows the standard deviation error of IOLED\nobtained from the Monte Carlo analysis results. It can be\nseen that, although the presence of CF contributes one more\nparameter influenced by the process variations, it does not cause\nmuch degradation of IOLED\u2019s uniformity.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nA simple and effective method is introduced to suppress\nthe S\/H nonidealities in S-I pixel circuits by adding a small\ncompensation capacitance for designing high-performance\nAMOLEDs. With this method, the pixel circuits do not need\nto use large-size storage capacitor and complicated circuit\nconfigurations. The simulation results show the current-copying\naccuracy, and the output linearity is greatly improved with little\ndegradation of current uniformity via using such a method.\nThe method is applicable for both n-TFT and p-TFT S-I pixel\ncircuits for the inverted and normal top-emission OLED struc-\ntures. Some other configurations of S-I AMOLED pixel circuits\nwith S\/H operations may also benefit from this method.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J. N.
