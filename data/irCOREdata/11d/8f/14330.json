Relevant research\nliterature refers to the term constructionism (Papert, 1993) and exploratory learning\n(diSessa et al, 1995). Constructionism and exploratory learning are a synthesis of the\nconstructivist theory of Piaget and the opportunities offered by technology to education\non thinking concretely, on learning while constructing intelligible entities, and on\ninteracting with multimedia objects, rather than the direct acquisition of knowledge and\nfacts. These views are based on the approach that learners can take substantial control of\ntheir own learning in an appropriately designed physical and cultural environment (Harel,\n1991). In parallel, most of the studies of the Vygotskian framework focus on the role of\nlanguage in the learning procedure, considering conceptual thought to be impossible\noutside an articulated verbal thinking. Moreover, the specific use of words is considered\nto be the most relevant cause for childhood and adolescent differentiation (Vygotsky,\n1962).\nThese approaches offer important pedagogical ideas for the creation of powerful\ncomputational principles, such us procedures and interactive objects (Pea, 1992). They\n29\nV. Kotsanis et a\\ Learning morphological phenomena of modem Greek an exploratory approach\ncan be used in a flexible, reusable and modular way, and are usually referred to as the\nLISP-derived Logo-like environments (Hoyles et al, 1992; Georgiadis et al, 1993; diSessa\net al, 1995). Moreover, they concretize the argument about how different languages\n(spoken and programming) can influence cultures that grow up around them (Papert,\n1980).\nIndependent from educational technology, in the area of language technology natural-\nlanguage processing systems have attempted to encode linguistic information and to\nendow computers with human language capability. A unification-based grammar\nformalism has been widely used in a variety of these systems as a pattern-matching\ntechnique for different purposes. Definite-clause grammars from the logic programming\nfield, generalized phrase-structure grammars and typed-feature structures from the\ncomputational linguistics field are examples of formalisms based on unification (Shieber,\n1986; Carpenter, 1992). Specific morphological processing systems are used in a fairly\nbroad range of technological applications such as word processing, speech and language\napplications, and machine translation. These systems usually include a morphological\nprocessor that uses one or both of the following operations:\n\u2022 an analyser, to recognize the combination of morphemes that form a word and\/or the\nmorphosyntactic features associated to the word;\n\u2022 a synthesizer, to generate a well-formed word from its morphemes and\/or the\nmorphosyntactic features.\nMany systems and applications which take this direction have been presented (Sproat,\n1992), and specifically for the Greek language (Ralli, 1987; Kotsanis 1991; Markopoulos,\n1994). The 'two-level morphology' theory, with its KIMMO implementation, has been by\nfar the most successful and best-known general model of computational morphology\n(Koskenniemi, 1983; Antworth 1990). However, few references exist in the development\nof learning tools for modelling educational linguistic processes in an exploratory way\n(Sharpies, 1986; Ohmaye 1992).\nThe objective of our approach is to provide learners with a powerful and natural learning\nenvironment to study morphology and words more generally. Learners are provided with\ntools to develop educational environments for language. This approach presents a\ncomputational model for the description of concatenative morphological phenomena of\nmodern Greek (such as inflection, derivation, compounding - it can be extended to other\nlanguages as well) by allowing learners, trainers and developers to explore linguistic\nprocesses through their own constructions in an open-ended interactive multimedia\nenvironment. The proposed model introduces a new language metaphor, the 'puzzle\nmetaphor' (similar to the existing 'turtle-metaphor' for concepts from mathematics and\nphysics), based on a visualized unification-like mechanism for pattern matching. The\ncomputational implementation of the model can be used for creating environments for\nlearning through design and learning by teaching, based on the experience that learners\nprefer to choose the role of the developer rather than the role of the user.\nThe puzzle metaphor\nMetaphors are potentially important components of educational learning environments,\n30\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 3\nfor providing dynamic models of systems that learners can explore and study. The turtle-\nmetaphor, one of the most well-known, which uses the kinematic image of a curve as a\nmoving point, is based on deeply rooted intuitions concerning body motion. It can be\nused to generate rich mathematical and science environments, offering a visually\nattractive and comprehensible introduction to programming (Papert, 1980; Hoyles et al,\n1992). This mathematical-oriented metaphor is widely and internationally used for a\nbroad range of ages and activities (Kynigos, 1992; Georgiadis et al, 1993; Blaho et al,\n1994; diSessa et al, 1995). However, there are almost no references for a similar language\nmetaphor (Tinsley et al, 1995; Vosniadou et a\/, 1995), with the exception of the phrase-\nbooks and boxes, a general oriented language microworld for linguistic explorations\n(Sharpies, 1986).\nBy focusing our interest on morphological phenomena, the most adapted interpretation is\nbased on the approach that words are built up from smaller meaningful units, namely\nmorphemes. Morphological analysis (recognition) is concerned with retrieving the\nstructure of morphemes that form a word. Morphological generation is concerned with\nproducing an appropriate word-form from some set of morphosyntactic and semantic\nfeatures (Sproat, 1992). Important for performing these tasks is that inflected, derived or\ncompound words are built up via the successive application of word-formation rules,\nwhich are similar to syntactic rules for sentence formation. For example, we can define\nthe following simplified rule for the combination of an infinitive verb with the\nnominalizing er morpheme (Bear, 1986) such as read- reader.\nnoun \u2014\u00bb verb nominal\n<noun number> = singular\n<verb form> = infinitive\n<nominal string> = 'er'\nGeneral word-formation rules can be expressed as a context-free grammar of the form:\nword -\u00bb stem inflectional_ending\nstem -\u00bb stem derivational_suffix\nOur linear puzzle-metaphor concept introduces a slightly modified view of a word-\nformation mechanism. The puzzle metaphor, underlying the context-free grammar, does\nnot express the relation between the category of each morpheme (e.g. stem, ending) but\nthe position (from now on called puzzle-type) that a morpheme has inside the word (W):\nR: complete morphemes that do not concatenate,\nS: beginning morphemes that are concatenated only from the right,\nD: intermediate morphemes that are concatenated from both right and left,\nI: ending morphemes that are concatenated only from the left.\nThus our context-free phrase structure of the word-grammar model (for word W\nrecognition and generation) consists of the following three (and only these three) word-\nformation rules:\n31\nV. Kotsanis et al Learning morphological phenomena of modem Greek an exploratory approach\nW - > S I\nS ->SD\nThe above production rules generate only the following listed sequence of morphemes:\nR, S I, S D I, S D D I, S D D D I , . . .\n(further down),For example, the Greek words Karw (under, down),\n(graphic) and \u2022nepiypa^ncq (descriptive) are analysed as:\nS I: [napa]s\nSDE:\nS D D E :\nAny morpheme can belong to more than one puzzle-type.

To determine the appropriate order of morphemes within words, we have to\ndefine for each morpheme a set of attribute-value pairs (which are user-defined and\nconstitute a feature structure) containing several morphosyntactic pieces of information,\nfor example word category (part of speech), gender and voice. These pieces of\ninformation can also have semantic characteristics, for example 'consists *of. The\ndetermination of the attribute-value pairs does not restrict the underlying morpheme but\n32\nAa-j Volume 4 Number 3\nrather extends it to concatenate with the 'valid' next and\/or previous morphemes\n(Pentheroudakis et al, 1993). This means that each of the three puzzle-types (S, D, or I)\ncan be used as a previous or next puzzle-type (sketched with dotted-lines in the figures\nthat follow).\nIn Figure 1 two morphemes have been determined. The first morpheme, the stem \/3aa (of\nthe word fSdo-T) - basis) is of puzzle-type S and has an associated feature structure.

This unification mechanism is\nbased on the notion of combining the information from two feature structures to get a\nfeature structure with all of the information of both (Shieber, 1986).\nTable 3 contains examples of how the unification mechanism actually works (note that a\nvalue of an attribute-value pair, which consists of a feature structure, can also be a feature\nstructure).\nFeature structure a\ncat: noun\ncat: noun\ngender: fem\ncat: noun\ncat: noun\ncat:NP\nagreement: [num: sing]\nFeature structure b\ngender: fem\ncat: noun\ncat: adj\ncat: {noun, adj}\nagreement: (pers: 3rd]\nagreement: [pers: 3rd]\nTable 3: Unification examples (curly braces {} denote disjunction^\nUnification a U b\ncat: noun\ngender: fem\ncat: noun\ngender: fem\n-\ncat: noun\ncat:NP\nagreement: [pers: 3rd]\nagreement: [num: sing\npers: 3rd]\n\u2022\n34\nMl-) Volume 4 Number 3\nThe unification mechanism is performed only while parsing similar morpheme categories.\nFor example, in a puzzle-type X=S or D or I, unification will be applied only between the\ntwo morphemes where the first belongs to puzzle-type X and the previous or next of the\nsecond belongs also to puzzle-type X.\nThe morpheme of Figure 3, fiaa, can be concatenated with the inflectional ending 17 if the\nlatter is an 'inflectional ending' (value of the 'type' attribute) and has an attribute\n'inflectional category' with the value 'ij_ei?'. The derived inherits the values: noun,\nfeminine, singular, nominative, and is stressed at the penult (value 2 of the attribute\n'accent'). The morpheme j3a<r cannot be concatenated with a morpheme which has\ndifferent values for the attributes 'type' and 'inflectional category'.\nfigure 3: The unification process of two building blocks\nAttribute-value pairs, depending on their function, can be classified in two groups with\nthe following characteristics:\nInheritance or concatenation of values. As soon as the unification mechanism is started, the\nresulting allowed morpheme pairs contain a set of attribute-value pairs. In the word-\nformation process, the features of the word are inherited from the head of a\nmorphological constituent. If, for example, the unification mechanism generates:\nthe word will inherit the attribute 'cat' (part of speech) with value 'adjective', since the\nright-hand head rule dominates and is frequently cited in morphology (Selkirk, 1982;\nSproat 1992). Moreover, there are a number of cases which appear to have left-headed\nmorphological constructions which have to be defined to the inheritance process (for\nexample, the non-inflected prefix, ava, when attached to the word fido-q for the formation\nof the word avd^aat) - ascension, shifts the accent from the second to the third syllable\nfrom the ending of the word).\nIf the unification generates (in the above example):\nlPaaLtemMderivationaL^ix\u2122inflectional ending\n35\nV. Kotsanis et al Learning morphological phenomena of modem Greek: an exploratory approach\nthen the attribute 'type' of the word (with the values 'stem', 'derivational_suffix' and\n'inflectional_ending' for the three morphemes respectively) is derived by concatenating\nthe values; in this case the value would be 'stem & derivational_suffix &\ninflectional_ending'.\nValues: Every value of an attribute-value pair can be either a string (text), a sound, a\nbitmap (picture), an animation, a video or a user-defined procedure which will start a\ncomputation or will return a value.\nThe handling of multimedia objects and user-defined procedures as values in a feature\nstructure constitutes a powerful environment which covers a broad range of requirements\n(for example, handling of unusual morphological phenomena or audio-visual word-\nformation from audio-visual morphemes).\nImplementation\nThe suggested model has been implemented using the following environments:\nI. Prototyping using Prolog\nTo test the expressive power of the proposed formalism and to determine if the models\ngenerate all possible words of the given grammar (completeness), and if the words are\n'valid' in the underlying vocabulary (soundness) (Gazdar 1989), a pilot system has been\ndeveloped using Prolog which represents morphemes as follows:\ns t r ( MorphemeName, ListOfLettersInMorpheme ) .\nmorf( MorphemeName, TypesOfMorpheme, AttributesOfMorpheme ) .\nnext ( MorphemeName, TypesOfNextMorpheme, AttributesOfNextMorpheme ) .\nprev( MorphemeName, TyPesOfPreviousMorpheme, AttributesOfPreviousMorpheme) .\nThe TypesOf. . . fields are lists consisting of symbols from [R, S, D, I], while\nAt t r ibu te sOf . . . fields are lists of the form [[attr-l,[value-l-l,valuel-2, . . .]],\n[attr-2,[value-2-l,value2-2,...]],...]. Multiple next () and p rev () facts are allowed for\none morpheme. The distinction between the name of the morpheme and the actual list of\nletters that constitute it allows us to encode morphemes with similar behaviour under a\nsingle name. An example database would be:\nstr( bas, [%j3','a'# 'a'] .).\nmorf( bas, [s,d], [ [type,[stem]], [cat,[noun]], [gen,[fem]], [accent,[2]] ] ).\nnext( bas, [d], [ [type,[der_suffix]] ] ).\nnext( bas, [i], [ [type,[infl_end]], [inflcat,[c_ae6]] ] ).\nstr( ik, [%I','K'] ).\nmorf( ik, [d], [ [type,[der_suffix]], [cat,[adj]], [accent,[1]] ] ).\nprev( ik, [s,d], [ [type,[stem]], [cat,[noun,adj]] ] ).\nnext( ik, [d], [ [type,[der_suffix]], [cat,[noun]] ] ).\nnext( ik, [i], [ [type, [inf l_end] ], [ inf lcat, [OS_T\/_C] ] ] ).\nstx( i, pi?'] ).\nmorf ( i , [ i ] , [ [type, [infl_end] ] , [ inf l c a t , [oy_i?_oij_\u00a3is] ] , [numb, [sg] ] , [case,\n[nom,ace,voc]]]).\n36\nALT-) Volume 4 Number 3\nprev(i,[s,d],[[type,[stem,der_suffix]],[cat,[noun,adj]],[gen,[fern]],\n[accent,[1,2,3]]].\nThe above database and its associated grammar accept (generate) the following two, and\nonly two, valid Greek words:\n(80017 [bas,i]\n[bas,ik,i]\nThe current version of the prototype contains a lexicon of 200 different morphemes which\ngenerate about 5,000 valid words (nouns and verbs). At this point we should mention that\nright recursion of the grammar terminates normally, without the need to define a value\nfor the maximum allowed depth which is directly proportional to the maximum number\nof concatenated morphemes.\n2. Educational Logo-like multimedia environment\nAfter receiving the outcome of the previous mentioned prototype in Prolog, we started\nimplementing the proposed model by developing a microworld using a Logo-like\ninterpreter (based on Comenius Logo: Blaho et al, 1994). This interpreter is equipped\nwith new powerful primitive procedures and data types. Moreover, it works under the\nfamiliar Windows environment and takes full advantage of today's multimedia\ncapabilities.\nR Sb\nI D\n\"\u2022-, cat: {noun, adj}\nt\n\/ type: stem\nIK\ncat: adj\naccent: 1\ninflcat: oq_n_o\nsuffix\ni.

Further, the microworld allows or helps the user to group\nhis or her data. The implemented microworld introduces the following six new primitives:\n37\nY. Kotsanis et a\\ Learning morphological phenomena of modem Greek: an exploratory approach\nmakemorph: create basic or extended morphemes\ngetmorph: search for and modify an existing morpheme\ngetword: recognize and generate a valid concatenation of morphemes and build\nup a valid word\nsetpair: define and\/or modify attribute-value pairs and their characteristics\nloadbase: use an existing or user-defined knowledge base\nsavebase: save a knowledge base\nAll primitives have two modes of operation: graphical and command-line. The graphical\nmode of operation is intended for the visual interaction with the various morpheme\nobjects. The command-line mode is intended to provide users with primitives to\nimplement their own or extend existing lexical application. The system also contains\nspecial-purpose attribute-value pairs for executing video, sound, image, music, and user-\ndefined procedures.\nIn its present form, the system is being tested by a small group of educators and students.\nIt will be enhanced with the data of an educational multimedia dictionary developed at\nDoukas School in Athens (Kotsanis et al, 1996) and will be tested in classroom activities\nof the same school.\nConclusions\nThe suggested model and its educational value constitute a learning-by-doing\nenvironment which simplifies functions and lexical representations without neglecting the\nexpressive power of linguistic processes. Furthermore, it can introduce the idea of\ngrammars and parsing to secondary-level students. The open-ended design of the\nenvironment gives the opportunity easily to develop audio-visual lexical applications for\nstudents by using different teaching architectures (Schank, 1994) and enhancing the\nkernels of authoring environments. In this unified environment (for use and\ndevelopment), learners, trainers and developers have access to and can reuse the same\nresources and data. For example, students will be able to design a spelling checker or\nexpress orthographic rules on their own.\nThis environment can be enhanced in many ways. First, it can be modified to allow more\nthan one next or previous puzzle-type (S, D, or I) while defining morphemes. This results\nin the ability to describe long-distance dependencies where the existence of one morpheme\nis allowed by another morpheme which is not adjacent to it (for example, joy, *joy-able,\nen-joy-able: Sproat, 1992). It can also be extended to allow the description of\nphonological phenomena (Antworth, 1990). Further, all lexical components of the model\ncan be changed to graphical objects or even objects in space, so that it can be used by\nchildren at the primary educational level. Finally, in order to enhance the existing\ngraphical representation of the puzzle-types beyond their two-dimensional movement,\nthey can be moved and rotated in three-dimensions and their shapes changes (user-\ndefined or selected from the existing library).\n38\nALT-) Volume 4 Number 3\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank S.
