Introduction\nThe scientific community is becoming increasingly aware that the great revolution\nof this century is going to be the mathematical formalisation of phenomena in the\nLife Sciences, much as the revolution of the past two centuries was the development\nof the above approach in the Physical Sciences.\nTo quote J. E. Cohen:\n\u2014 Mathematics is Biology\u2019s next microscope, only better; Biology is Mathematics\u2019\nnext Physics, only better.\n593\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n594 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nThis endeavour is an enormous challenge that will require the intellectual energy\nof scientists working in the field of mathematics and physics collaborating closely\nwith biologists and clinicians. This essentially means that the heuristic experimen-\ntal approach, which is the traditional investigative method in the Biological Sci-\nences, should be complemented by the mathematical modelling approach. The latter\ncan be used as a hypothesis-testing and indeed, hypothesis-generating, tool which\ncan help to direct experimental research, while the results of experiments help to\nrefine the modelling. The goal of this research is that, by iterating back and forth\nbetween experiment and theory, eventually a deeper conceptual understanding is\nreached of how the highly nonlinear processes in biology interact. The ultimate\ngoal in the clinical setting is to use mathematical models to help design therapeutic\nstrategies.\nThe analysis of complex biological systems by a mathematical approach is moti-\nvated by top level biologists and is documented in several recent papers appear-\ning in journals dedicated to the life sciences. Among others, Antia, Ganusov, and\nAhmed17 analyse the role of mathematical models in biology, while May137 analyses\nrelatively more general aspects of the use of mathematics in the biological sciences.\nThis interesting paper looks for an equilibrium between a naive enthusiastic atti-\ntude and unreasonable scepticism. The beginning of the above cited paper captures\nthe main conceptual ideas:\n\u2014 In the physical sciences, mathematical theory and experimental investigation have\nalways marched together. Mathematics has been less intrusive in the life sciences,\npossibly because they have been until recently descriptive, lacking the invariance\nprinciples and fundamental natural constants of physics.\nMoreover, the same author also reports the sentiments of the great Charles\nDarwin:\nI have deeply regretted that I did not proceed far enough at least to understand\nsomething of the great leading principles of mathematics; for men thus endowed\nseem to have an extra sense.\nKey comments on interdisciplinary approaches can be found in various papers\nauthored by scientists operating in the field of molecular and cellular biology. The\npaper by Hartwell et al.,103 for example, deeply analyses the conceptual differences\nbetween the difficulties in dealing with inert and living matter. Living systems are\ncharacterised by specific features absent in classical mechanics: such as, for example,\nreproduction, competition, cell cycle, and the ability to communicate with other\nentities.\nAlso in this case, it is pertinent to quote from the above article:\nBiological systems are very different from the physical or chemical systems analysed\nby statistical mechanics or hydrodynamics. Statistical mechanics typically deals with\nsystems containing many copies of a few interacting components, whereas cells con-\ntain from millions to a few copies of each of thousands of different components,\neach with very specific interactions.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 595\nAlthough living systems obey the laws of physics and chemistry, the notion of\nfunction or purpose differentiates biology from other natural sciences.\nMoreover:\nMore important, what really distinguishes biology from physics are survival and\nreproduction, and the concomitant notion of function.\nIt is worth stressing that essentially analogous concepts are proposed in the\npaper by Reed168 according to the viewpoint of applied mathematicians. Once\nmore, the author comments on the crucial difference between dealing with living\nmatter and inert matter: essentially the lack of background models to support the\nderivation of mathematical equations.\nFurthermore, along with environmental factors, survival or reproduction in liv-\ning matter is determined by gene expression and resulting phenotypic character-\nistics. Genetic instability causing random gene mutations can alter phenotypic\nexpression, which may increase viability or proliferation in certain environmen-\ntal circumstances, thus causing the expansion of the mutation in the population.\nThe expansion of a particular phenotype may alter the environment, which in turn\naffects evolutionary selection, and so on. Therefore, a particular challenge to math-\nematical modellers is to properly include this dynamic genetic and evolutionary\ncomponent in any theoretical framework.\nCancer modelling has, over the years, grown immensely as one of the challenging\ntopics involving applied mathematicians working with researchers active in the\nbiological sciences. The motivation is not only scientific as in the industrial nations\ncancer has now moved from seventh to second place in the league table of fatal\ndiseases, being surpassed only by cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, the World Health\nOrganisation estimates that at present, cancer kills approximately six million people\nannually. Furthermore, as the population in western countries ages, for instance in\nthe near future there will be more people in Europe over 60 than under 20, age-\nrelated illnesses, such as cancer, will become even more of a problem. For these\nreasons the fight against cancer is of major importance for public health (and also\neconomic resources) throughout the world. Technical data and websites are reported\nin Sec. 1 of the paper by Roose, Chapman and Maini.170\nThe importance of examining the genetic mutations in cancer development\nis emphasised in Hanahan and Weinberg\u2019s landmark paper,102 The Hallmarks of\nCancer. In this paper, they identify six critical changes in cell physiology that char-\nacterise malignant cancer growth. These six changes \u2014 self-sufficiency in growth\nsignals, insensitivity to anti-growth signals, evading apoptosis, limitless replicative\npotential, sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion and metastasis, all incorporate\nsome aspect of genetic mutation and evolutionary selection leading to malignant\nprogression. Although preliminary work on cancer modelling has included one or\nmore of these hallmarks, few theoretical papers have addressed the mutations and\nselection which lead to the outward expression of these characteristics. Indeed, it\nis well accepted that the onset of cancer occurs through a sequence of genetic\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n596 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nmutations and evolutionary selection leading to malignancy, a concept not yet well\naddressed through mathematical modelling.\nThusfar, mathematical models have mainly concentrated on only two of Hana-\nhan and Weinberg\u2019s hallmarks: angiogenesis and invasion. Some models have incor-\nporated other hallmarks (such as limitless replicative potential), without actually\nexamining the mutations or environments leading to such phenotypes. As such,\nalthough the current models provide a solid foundation for the study of these cel-\nlular processes, given that these processes interact, the next step is to develop an\nintegrated model which can then be used to investigate fully the effects of manip-\nulating various components. Although a greater understanding of the biological\npathways that lead to these physiological changes will help to create more realis-\ntic models, there are still many general questions that can be examined through\nmodelling. Integrated, multiscale models that address each of the hallmarks of can-\ncer, and provide mechanistic explanations for observed behaviour, could potentially\nprovide breakthroughs in understanding cancer and improving treatment.\nModelling and simulation of tumour growth is certainly one of the challeng-\ning frontiers of applied mathematics which could have a great impact both on the\nquality of life and the development of the mathematical sciences. It is true that\nmathematics alone cannot solve the problem of cancer. However, applied math-\nematics may be able to provide a framework in which experimental results can\nbe interpreted, and a quantitative analysis of external actions to control neoplas-\ntic growth can be developed. Specifically, models and simulations can reduce the\namount of experimentation necessary for drug and therapy development. Moreover,\nthe mathematical theory developed might not only provide a detailed description\nof the spatiotemporal evolution of the system, but may also help us understand and\nmanipulate aspects of the process that are difficult to access experimentally.\nResearch perspectives in this specific field are analysed by Gatenby and Maini,93\nwho suggest the development of a research line which may be called mathematical\noncology. Indeed, applied mathematicians are becoming more and more involved in\nthe above challenging research field. This activity is documented in a large number\nof mathematical research and review papers and in the collection of surveys in\nbooks1,167,25 or special issues of journals.30\u201332\nIt is interesting to observe that the aforementioned cited paper93 suggests the\ndevelopment of a new game theory as a fundamental paradigm to deal with the\nabove topic. Several scientists propose this type of reasoning on the modelling of\nevolutionary games, as documented in the papers by Nowak and Sigmund149 and\nGatenby et al.96 This topic will be more fully analysed in Sec. 5 as it may act as\na fundamental paradigm towards the development of a bio-mathematical theory\nof cancer, that is the very final aim of the interaction between the biological and\nmathematical sciences in the research field under consideration.\nThis paper presents a review and critical analysis of some selected issues related\nto the mathematical approach to the modelling of phenomena in cancer, to offer to\napplied mathematicians suitable research perspectives with particular focus on the\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 597\nfollowing key issues:\n\u2022 Multiscale aspects of the biological phenomena and of the related mathematical\napproaches.\n\u2022 Strategies to select the correct mathematical framework to deal with modelling\nat each scale, being aware that the existing mathematical approaches have not\nyet reached the identification of a uniquely defined approach.\n\u2022 Development of methods to link models at the scale selected with those at the\ncorresponding lower and higher scales. In the case of this paper, models at the\ncellular scale are supplemented by models at the molecular (genetic) scale and\ngenerate models at the higher, tissue level, scale.\n\u2022 Looking for paradigms for the development of a mathematical biological the-\nory related to the complex system we are dealing with. In other words, it is\nworth understanding how far scientists are from the development of a mathe-\nmatical theory analogous to physical mathematical theories developed in the past\ncentury.\nIt is worth stressing that we do not aim to cover the whole variety of issues\nand the vast literature in the field, but simply to capture, out of the essential\nbibliography on the above selected topics, the main issues related to the modelling\nof cancerous phenomena with special focus on multiscale aspects. Therefore, while\nwe do not claim to carry out a complete review, we hope to cover sufficient material\nto motivate more applied mathematicians to develop a research activity in the field\nwhich, as we will point out, also includes highly challenging analytic problems.\nWe have attempted to describe problems (rather than write equations) to iden-\ntify the mathematical structure of the various classes of models. The reader inter-\nested in details is guided to the specific literature by citations attempting to cover\nthe various issues dealt with in the paper. Moreover, we do not claim completeness\nof bibliographical citations which have been limited to 200 titles. It is a selection\nout of a large and rapidly growing bibliography in the field.\nAfter the above preliminaries, the contents of this paper, which is organised into\nsix sections, are as follows:\n\u2014 Section 2 deals with a phenomenological description of the aspects of the biol-\nogy which are the subject of the various mathematical modelling approaches\nreviewed in the sections which follow. The contents focus on two main issues:\nthe observation and representation scales and the implications for the mathe-\nmatical approaches due to the fact that we are dealing with a living system. As\nwe shall see, both aspects play a crucial role in the selection of the mathematical\nstructures to be used for modelling.\n\u2014 Section 3 deals with modelling at the microscopic scale, describing the evolution\nof cells organised into several cell populations each characterised by different\nbiological functions and activities. Specifically, the analysis refers to two classes\nof models: models where all cells are equivalent, with internal structure which\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n598 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nmay evolve in time; and models in which characteristics of the cells are allowed\nto vary from cell to cell and are modified by cellular interactions and signalling.\n\u2014 Section 4 deals with modelling at the macroscopic scale when tumour cells are\norganised into solid tissues with growing and invasive competence. The appropri-\nate modelling approach, using continuum or individual based models, depends\non the system of interest. Continuum models use systems of partial differential\nequations corresponding to different cell populations or chemical substances.\nDifferent approaches, which are generated by different modes of closing conser-\nvation equations by phenomenological models describing the material behaviour\nof the system, are detailed. A fundamental problem of continuum modelling is\nthat it tracks the average behaviour of cells, while the driving macroscopic or\nmalignant behaviour may originate away from the average behaviour. In this\ncase, the utilisation of discrete, cell-based models can be more appropriate.\nThis section also reports on the link between the microscopic and macroscopic\nscales, through the derivation of macroscopic equations from the underlying\nmicroscopic description developed at the cellular scale.\n\u2014 Section 5 reports the existing literature on the passage from the molecular to\nthe cellular scale, i.e. from genotypic to phenotypic distributions. Then, starting\nfrom this overview, some perspective ideas are proposed in view of the last part\nof the paper to develop a mathematical theory for multicellular systems which\ninclude genetic mutations, onset of neoplastic cells, and growth, if not suppressed\nby the immune system or specific therapeutical actions.\n\u2014 Section 6 presents an overview of complexity analysis related to modelling the\noverall system and provides a review of some recent approaches to multiscale\nmodelling. This is a challenging and still open mathematical problem.\n\u2014 Section 7 proposes a critical analysis on the background, however difficult, objec-\ntive of developing a proper mathematical theory of biological systems: not simply\nmodels, but a self-consistent mathematical description, where the parameters\nof the models are derived from appropriate experimental data.\nThis paper aims to provide not only a review of the existing literature, but also\na critical analysis addressed to indicate, and hopefully to provide direction on, new\ntheoretical research perspectives. We are convinced that the complexity of the sys-\ntem we are dealing with requires the invention of new mathematical methods, or at\nleast new ideas, to place into a mathematical context the above-mentioned complex-\nity. Indeed, the above topics generate interesting and very challenging mathemat-\nical problems. Although their analysis may not, in some cases, have an immediate\nimpact on biology, mathematicians are however attracted by them.\nThis is an additional aspect of the interplay between mathematics and biology:\nin this case biologists may be disappointed by the attraction of mathematicians\ntowards challenging mathematical problems, even when the relevance to applica-\ntions is not evident. On the other hand, mathematicians should not be blamed: at\nleast in some cases, this analysis leads to results which are useful for various different\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 599\nfields of the applied sciences and hopefully also to the progress of the mathematical\nsciences. In this respect, mathematicians are no different from the biologists who\nbecome engrossed in technical experimental detail and lose sight of the overall goal.\nIndeed, one may argue that it is essential for researchers in each discipline to do\nexactly that, while it is the responsibility (and the art) of interdisciplinary research\nto see how different techniques from different disciplines may be used to answer the\noverarching scientific questions.\n2. Multiscale Aspects of Cancer Modelling\nThe complex biological system dealt with in this paper needs, as already mentioned,\na multiscale mathematical approach. However, scaling190 is not the only problem\nas modelling also needs a deep understanding of the different functions expressed at\nthe different scales: from genes to biological tissues. This section is devoted to a brief\npreliminary analysis of some biological phenomena related to the aforementioned\nscales.\nWhile the description we provide may not be satisfactory from the viewpoint\nof biology, it attempts to extract some interpretations of reality to set the essential\nbackground for the mathematical approach reviewed in what follows. The reader,\ninterested in a deeper understanding of the biology of cancer, will find the book by\nWeinberg197 a highly valuable reference.\nThe first event to be considered is the generation of a neoplastic cell through\nphenotypic alterations resulting from genetic mutations occurring through genetic\ninstability and environmental interactions. After the onset of neoplasia, various\ncomplex phenomena occur which are related to different scales. The characterisa-\ntion of the system suggests the identification of three natural scales which are also\nconnected to different stages of the disease: processes on the cellular scale are trig-\ngered by signals stemming from the sub-cellular level and have an impact on the\nmacroscopic scale, i.e. on the organism, when tumours grow and spread. In detail:\nThe sub-cellular scale: The evolution of a cell is regulated by the genes contained in\nits nucleus. Receptors on the cell surface can receive signals which are then trans-\nmitted to the cell nucleus, where the aforementioned genes can be activated or\nsuppressed. In extreme situations, particular signals can induce uncontrolled cell\nproliferation, or cell death- so-called apoptosis or programmed cell death. Unreg-\nulated proliferation may activate interactions between tumour cells and host cells,\nwhich occur at the cellular level but are mediated by subcellular processes, such\nas through signal cascades and receptor expression. These interactions can result\nin temporary, or even permanent, alterations in gene expression, which in turn can\naffect a cell\u2019s state, such as activation or inactivation of immune cells.\nThe cellular scale: On the microscopic level, models are proposed to simulate the\neffects of cell\u2013cell interactions. These interactions are key elements at all stages of\ntumour formation, whether they are among tumour cells and host cells, or among\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n600 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\ntumour cells themselves. For example, early in tumour development, if the immune\nsystem is active and able to recognise tumour cells, it may be able to develop a\ndestruction mechanism and induce cancer cell death; otherwise, the tumour may\nevade apoptosis or co-opt the host cells, allowing progressive growth. During inva-\nsion and metastasis, alterations in cell\u2013cell adhesion between individual tumour cells\nare key to driving the process. These and other cellular interactions are regulated\nby signals emitted and received by cells through complex transduction processes.\nTherefore, the connection to the aforementioned sub-cellular scale is evident. On\nthe other hand, the growth of tumour cells, if not cleared by the immune system,\nwill form a mass so that macroscopic features become important. However, even\nafter the formation of a tumour structure, interactions between individual cells\n(signalling, migration or proliferation) are crucial to driving macroscopic processes\n(such as blood vessel formation or invasion), underscoring the need to link these\nmultiple scales.\nThe macroscopic scale: The initial developing tumour can be characterised by three\nzones: an external proliferating layer, an intermediate layer in which there are clus-\nters of quiescent tumour cells, and an inner zone with necrotic cells. Prior to vascular-\nisation, these avascular tumours reach an equilibrium size of about 2mm in diameter,\nwhere their growth is limited by diffusion of nutrients until the onset of angiogenesis\n(the process of formation of new blood vessels, induced by factors secreted by the\ntumour, and vital for continued tumour growth). Although the angiogenic process\nis often described macroscopically, it occurs through processes at the cellular scale,\nsuch as migration, proliferation, and cell\u2013cell signalling. These events are generated\nat the gene level. The above description of tumour evolution can also occur with\ndifferent geometrical characteristics, for instance around cords or surfaces bounding\nnutrient sources. In these cases, the proliferative zone will be (internal) next to the\nnutrient supply and the necrotic zone will be the outermost layer.\nAfter the initiation of the \u201cangiogenic switch\u201d, the tumour expands and becomes\na heterogenous tissue, where some of the previously mentioned \u201clayers\u201d may actu-\nally occur as \u201cislands\u201d, leading to a tumour comprised of multiple regions of necro-\nsis, engulfed by tumour cells in a quiescent or proliferative state. Furthermore, these\nzones vary through the course of tumour development, as nutrient delivery alters\nvia blood vessel collapse or formation, changing proliferating zones to necrotic and\nvice versa. In each of these layers, interactions between tumour and normal cells\n(such as immune cells and blood vessels) are crucial in determining growth and\nmalignant progression. Here, one has the overlap of phenomena at the cellular level\nwith typical macroscopic behaviour such as diffusion or, more generally, phenomena\nthat can be related to the mass balance or evolution of macroscopic variables such\nas tumour size. Moreover, most transitions from one cellular state to another are\ninduced at the genetic level.\nDifferent mathematical methods and structures correspond to the different\nscales described above. For instance, models at the cellular scale are gener-\nally developed in terms of ordinary differential equations or Boolean networks,\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 601\nwhile multicellular systems are modelled by nonlinear integro-differential equations\nsimilar to those of nonlinear kinetic theory (the Boltzmann equation), by individual-\nbased models which give rise to a large set of discrete equations, or by partial dif-\nferential equations for systems with internal structures. Macroscopic models lead to\nsystems of nonlinear partial differential equations or discrete modelling approaches.\nNonlinearity is an intrinsic feature of all models. However, the above introduction to\nmathematical structures needs to be put into a detailed mathematical framework,\nand this is the main focus of the sections which follow.\n3. Modelling at the Cellular Scale\nSection 2 illustrates that different scales are needed to represent crucial phenomena\noccurring during tumour growth. Moreover, it may be that all scales are needed\nto understand various biological phenomena. Hence, multiscale methods should be\ndeveloped and the following strategy is one possibility: identify the mathematical\nstructures needed to describe biological phenomena at each scale, then connect the\nvarious structures to model the overall system, viewing it as a network of several\ninterconnected subsystems or modules with feed-back down and feed-forward up\nscales.\nThis section is devoted to modelling at the cellular scale as the intermediate\nbetween the molecular and the macroscopic scales. The passage from the lower to\nthe higher scale will be treated in Secs. 4 and 5.\nMulticellular systems have been modelled by different approaches correspond-\ning to different levels of approximation of biological reality. Each approach needs\ndifferent mathematical structures as documented in the three subsections which fol-\nlow corresponding, respectively, to population dynamics, populations of cells with\ninternal structure, and kinetic theory for active particles. Then, in Sec. 4, a short\ndiscussion and critique is given.\nConcerning the aforementioned different modelling approaches, it is important\nto comment on their ability to model heterogeneous phenomena, i.e. the non-\nuniform distribution of the microscopic states (biological functions) of cells. A\nschematic of heterogeneity is given in Fig. 1, representing different stages and distri-\nbutions of mutated cells which have lost their differentiation state and are progress-\ning towards metastatic competence. In this case the biological function expressed\nby cells is called progression.100,150\nThe following review is limited to the indication of mathematical structures\nwhich may act as general paradigms for the derivation of specific models to be cast\ninto these frameworks. Details on specific models can be obtained by reference to\nthe bibliography.\n3.1. Population dynamics\nCoupled ordinary differential equations can be used to model large systems of cell\npopulations, where each variable corresponds to a well-defined biological property\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n602 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nFig. 1. Heterogeneity and progression of tumour cells: Time evolution of the probability distri-\nbution (f) over the variable (u) expressing the differentiation state of cells.\ncharacteristic of all cells of the same population. These models are formulated by\naveraging over the space variable and over the biological function expressed by each\npopulation so that the state of the system is simply described by the number density\nof cells within each population, while their structure is a technical development of\nLokta\u2013Volterra type equations:\ndni\ndt\n= \u03d5i(t,n), (3.1)\nwhere n denotes the set {n1, . . . , nn} of the numeric densities of cells, for i =\n1, . . . , n, for a system of n interacting populations.\nThe structure of the terms \u03d5i depends on the modelling approach related to\nthe specific system under consideration. The presence of time in the argument may\nappear if the system is open to external time-dependent actions, e.g. chemotherapy.\nThe literature in the field is vast, developed from pioneering papers modelling\nthe onset of cancer and the temporal evolution of cell density supported by the\npresence of nutrients, but limited by competition with the immune system. The\npaper by Gyllenberg and Webb,101 to our knowledge, initiated a systematic devel-\nopment of population dynamics models focused on cancer. This approach has been\ndeveloped by various authors as documented in the collection of surveys by Adam\nand Bellomo1 and in the bibliography of the various papers published in special\nissues of journals.109,117 The book by Perthame158 provides, in Chap. 1, a survey\nof population models in biology, related to a vast bibliography documented in sev-\neral books, e.g. Edelstein-Keshet77 and Thieme.185 The review is completed by an\nintroduction to classical mathematical problems: stability analysis, bifurcation and\nasymptotic behaviour.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 603\nVarious authors have used the above approach to model open systems sub-\nject to different therapies, e.g. Kirschner and Panetta,115 Nani and Freedman,148\nd\u2019Onofrio,71 De Pillis et al.,65,66,68 Arciero et al.,18 Moore and Li,147 Byrne et al.47\nTomlinson and Bodmer,187 d\u2019Onofrio and Tomlinson,72 Johnston et al.112,113\ndeal with a deeper additional insight into cell dynamics modelling failure of pro-\ngrammed cell death and differentiation as causes of tumour growth. Smieja and\nSwierniak179 develop models of chemotherapy based on gene amplification analysis.\nA detailed report on the application of population dynamics models in immunol-\nogy is given in the review paper by Perelson and Weisbuch157 related to biological\ntheory in the field.39,75,87,156\nTime delay is introduced by various authors, e.g. Foris and Bodmer,82,83 to\nmodel how the delayed response of the immune system in identifying the presence\nof tumour cells acts as a bifurcation parameter to separate two different outputs of\ncompetition: blow-up of tumour cell density or its suppression due to the action of\nthe immune system.\nThe advantage of the above approach is that models are easily tractable, allow-\ning a relatively rapid identification of the parameters characterising the model\nby suitable comparisons with experimental data. On the other hand, these sim-\nplifications omit potentially important phenomena, such as spatial aspects, and\nheterogeneity100 among cells of the same population. As we shall see, the latter\nplays a potentially important role in the evolution of the system and the vari-\nous interactions and competitions between cells of different populations. Moreover,\nthe identification of parameters is definitely useful for application, but it is at the\nmacroscopic scale so that it cannot be easily related to specific biological functions\ngenerally developed at the molecular and cellular scale.\nFinally, it is worth discussing the concept of populations with reference to the\nidea of functional modules proposed by Hartwell et al.103 After having observed\nthat biological systems may be characterised by an enormous number of copies,\nwhile only a few copies generally characterise living systems, it is proposed103 to\nreduce complexity by grouping different entities through looking at their collective\nexpression of biological functions related to the specific biological events under\nobservation. This suggestion is developed29 in a way that each population can be\nregarded as a module.\n3.2. Population dynamics with internal structure\nSystems of partial differential equations can be used to model large systems of inter-\nacting cells whose microscopic state includes internal variables related to biological\nfunctions. This internal structure, generally a scalar variable, characterises specific\nfunctions of the cell and can greatly influence the biological events under consider-\nation. For instance, the internal variable can be the age of the cell as determined\nby the cell cycle, which has crucial influence on various biological phenomena such\nas apoptosis, cell division, mutation, etc.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n604 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nA systematic introduction to cell population dynamics with internal structure\nhas been given by Webb,196 followed by several interesting books, e.g. Iannelli,110\nCushing,60 Dieckmann and Heesterbeck,69 Thieme,185 Perthame,158\u2013160 Perthame\nand Zubelli,162 Dyson et al.76 The bibliographies cited in these monographs cover\nthe existing literature in the field.\nAge-structured models describe the evolution of cellular systems for times of\nthe same order of the cell cycle. Their structure is as follows:\n\u2202tNi(t, a) + \u2202aNi(t, a) = Qi(N)(t, a), (3.2)\nwhere N denotes the set {N1, . . . , Nn} of the cell densities for i = 1, . . . , n, of a\nsystem of n interacting populations of cells. The densities Ni depend on time and\non the age a. The terms Qi refer to interactions between populations. Note that\na further complication in these models is that if, for example, a is \u201cage\u201d taken as\nprogression through the cell cycle, then we also need to know how this evolves in\ntime, as this will alter the form of the above equation.\n3.3. On the kinetic theory for active particles\nBiological function is statistically distributed across cells. This biological phe-\nnomenon generates the so-called heterogeneity related to progression and to immune\nactivation as documented, for example, in the papers by Greller, Tobin and Poste100\nand Nowell.150 Models should have the ability to describe progression of cancer cells\nand their competition with immune cells which express their antagonistic ability,\nunless inhibited, to limit cancer cell density growth.\nParticular pathologies may be thought of as an emergent property of the output\nof various genetic mutations which generate new cells with increasing degree of\nmalignancy. After various genetic mutations, cells may acquire the ability to succeed\nin escaping from the immune system despite the sentinel guards which, should,\nin principle, limit cell growth. (See, for example, Lollini, Motta, Pappalardo and\nCastiglione,130,124 Vogelstein and Kinzler,192 Blankenstein39).\nApplication of mathematical kinetic theory to model immune competition with\nspecific focus on cancer was initiated by Bellomo and Forni27 and subsequently\ndeveloped by various authors. Recent contributions are due to, among others,\nDerbel,64 De Angelis and Jabin,61 Kolev,118 Kolev, Kozlowska and Lachowicz,119\nBellouquid and Delitala,33,34 Brazzoli and Chauviere.43 Several interesting results\nare reported in the already cited book by Bellouquid and Delitala35 which, in par-\nticular, address a number of aspects of the above-mentioned competition.\nTypes of biological function differ from population to population, while the\noverall representation of the multicellular (multi-population) system is statistically\ndescribed by the distribution functions:\nfi = fi(t, u) : [0, T ]\u00d7Du \u2192 R+, i = 1, . . . , n, (3.3)\nover the microscopic state u \u2208 Du of cells of each population labelled by the sub-\nscript i.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 605\nBy definition, dni = fi(t, u) du denotes the number density of cells, regarded as\nactive particles, which, at time t, are in the element [u, u+ du] of the space of the\nmicroscopic state. Mathematical models should then describe the evolution in time\nof the distribution functions fi. When these functions are obtained by solution of\nthe resultant equations gross averaged quantities can be computed. For instance, the\nlocal number density of cells is calculated, under suitable integrability assumptions\non fi, as follows:\nni(t) =\n\u222b\nDu\nfi(t, u) du, (3.4)\nwhile the following quantities:\nai = a[fi](t) =\n\u222b\nDu\nufi(t, u) du (3.5)\nand\nAi = A[fi](t) =\na[fi](t)\nni(t)\n(3.6)\nhave been called,29 respectively, activation and the activation density. These quanti-\nties represent, respectively, the overall activity of the cells per unit volume and their\nmean activity. Analogous calculations can be developed for higher order moments.\nThe formal structure, which describes the evolution of fi, is obtained by the\nbalance of particles in the elementary volume of the microscopic state. Only the case\nof spatial homogeneity is reported in what follows. Indications will then be given\nas to how to deal with models with spatial structure. The following interactions are\nconsidered:\n\u2022 External actions, either therapeutical actions or other external agents, which\nmodify the distribution function;\n\u2022 Stochastic modification of the microscopic state of cells due to binary interactions\nwith other cells of the same or of different populations. These interactions are\ncalled conservative as they do not modify the number density of the various\npopulations;\n\u2022 Genetic alteration of cells which may either increase the progression of tumour\ncells or even generate, by clonal selection, new cells in a new population of cancer\ncells with higher level of malignancy;\n\u2022 Proliferation or destruction of cells due to binary interactions with other cells of\nthe same or of different populations.\nConsequently one has:\n\u2202tfi(t, u) + Fi(t) \u2202ufi(t, u) = Ji[f ](t, u) = Ci[f ](t, u) + Pi[f ](t, u) +Di[f ](t, u),\n(3.7)\nwhere the right-hand side models the flow, at time t, into the elementary volume\n[u, u+du] of the state space of the ith population due to transport and interactions.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n606 N.

(3.11)\nThe above structure acts as a framework for the derivation of specific models,\nobtained by a detailed consideration of microscopic interactions. The modelling\nneeds to be completed to generate well-defined expressions for the terms \u03b7, B and\n\u00b5. However, following the principle that we must try, where possible, to reduce com-\nplexity, each population is identified only by its ability to perform one biological\nfunction (activity).\nModels of spatial dynamics can be developed by different approaches. For\ninstance Bellouquid and Delitala35 model cell\u2013cell interactions by assuming they\ndepend on the distance between and microscopic states of the interacting pairs. A\nrelatively simpler approach has been proposed by Othmer and Hillen152 to derive\nequations at tissue level from the underlying microscopic description. Models with\nspatial structure are obtained by a random walk perturbation of spatially homoge-\nneous models.\n3.4. Summary\nVarious mathematical approaches to modelling multicellular systems at different\nrepresentation scales have been reviewed in this section. The advantages of each\napproach with respect to the others have already been discussed. However, if we\nwish to model at a certain scale, a priori, we have no indication of which other\nscales we must take into account. In most cases, one probably has to consider many\nscales. In reality, the choice will be determined by the question we are trying to\nanswer and the availability of data and biological insight.\nMoreover, the above review does not cover the whole variety of methods. Among\nothers, one may consider individual-based models (Othmer, Dumbar and Alt,151\nStevens181) which deal with the dynamics of individual cells (see also Drasdo\net al.73 and Drasdo and Home74). Hybrid models can be developed by using cellular\nautomata or agent-based approaches,67 where the macroscopic flow is linked to the\nmicroscopic biological state of cells. This type of framework appears more natural\nfor the inclusion of individual cell properties and therefore is conceptually more\nstraightforward. However, as the number of cells increases to biologically realistic\nlevels, it can become computationally intractable.\nHybrid approaches have been proposed53 based on population dynamics models\nwith stochastic coefficients arising from modelling kinetic type interactions at the\nmolecular level. These approaches, which are still in the early stages of investigation,\nhave the potential to reduce significantly the complexity of models of the kinetic\ntheory for active particles.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n608 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nThe above reasoning shows that when a high level of accuracy of description is\nreached, not only is computational complexity involved, but there is also the implicit\ndifficulty of determining the parameters of the model. Therefore, the problem of\nselecting the most appropriate modelling approach is still open.\n4. From Cellular to Macroscopic Tissue Models\nA large body of literature has been devoted to models which link the cellular scale to\nthe macroscopic tissue scale. In this way, models can address how changes in cell\u2013cell\ninteractions affect the macroscopic properties of the tumour. Once cells have formed\na tumour mass, features on the macroscopic level of the tumour environment must\nbe considered. For example, the availability of nutrients and transport of cytokine\nsignals has a profound impact on tumour progression. Conversely, the tumour cells\nthemselves can create areas of acidosis which in turn affect the properties of the\ncellular and acellular components of the surrounding environment.\nModels which address how cellular changes affect macroscopic distributions are\nespecially important when examining Hanahan and Weinberg\u2019s last two hallmarks\nof cancer: sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion and metastasis.102 Also, it is\nimportant to note that although these macroscopic properties can be sufficiently\nmodelled at a single scale, they occur through genetic mutations and evolution-\nary selection. This link has not yet been fully modelled, and will be discussed\nin Sec. 5.\nNevertheless, there has been much success in using macroscopic models to exam-\nine tumour malignancy. The two main types of models used are continuum, which\nexamine average behaviour of the densities of populations or components, and dis-\ncrete, which can track the behaviour of individual cells. These types of models\nemploy a wide variety of mathematical methods, as they can describe phenomeno-\nlogical interactions between cells or mechanical interactions based on measuring\nstresses and strains of the system. All of these methods make some a priori assump-\ntions about cell behaviour: for example, they either assume a cell moves through a\nprocess like diffusion, or the cellular components act like an elastic fluid. There have\nbeen some attempts at validating these assumptions mathematically, by building\ncellular models and extrapolating movement behaviour at the macroscopic scale,\nwhich we will also discuss in Sec. 4.3.\nFigures 2 and 3 illustrate schematically some important points that must be\nincorporated in a continuum description. Figure 2 illustrates tumour-generated\nsubstances (angiogenic factors) which attract endothelial cells towards the tumour.\nThese cells form blood vessels so at the macroscopic level one sees capillary sprouts\nmoving towards the tumour to provide nutrient and allow further growth.\nFigure 3 shows in more detail the structure of a tumour representing the inner\nzone (dark) of necrotic cells, the intermediate one (light) of quiescent cells, and\nthe proliferative outer zone (grey). Chemoattractants are generated by the hypoxic\nzone near the necrotic zone.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 609\nFig. 2.

Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\n4.1. Mathematical framework for continuum models\nContinuum models at the macroscopic scale are generally stated in terms of par-\ntial differential equations which describe the evolution in time and space of locally\naveraged quantities related to the behaviour of cell populations. A large variety of\ncontinuum models are derived using mass balance equations for the cellular com-\nponents and reaction\u2013diffusion equations for the chemicals or nutrients. However,\ndifferent choices of the mathematical form of the cellular movement lead to very\ndifferent models, which we will explore presently.\nThe initial system is composed of mass balance equations for the cellular com-\nponents, extracellular matrix (ECM), and the extracellular fluid (ECF), Eq. (4.1)1,\ncoupled to a system of reaction-diffusion equations for the concentration of extra-\ncellular chemicals, Eq. (4.1)2.\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n\u03c1j\n[\n\u2202\u03c6j\n\u2202t\n+\u2207x \u00b7 (\u03c6jvj)\n]\n= \u0393j(\u03c1, \u03c6, c), j = 1, . . . , L,\n\u2202ci\n\u2202t\n+\u2207x \u00b7 (ci v`) = \u2207x \u00b7 (Qi(\u03c1, \u03c6, c)\u2207ci) + \u039bi(\u03c1, \u03c6, c), i = 1, . . . ,M,\n(4.1)\nwhere \u03c6j = \u03c6j(t,x) denotes the concentration of each component, e.g. cells, matrix,\nor fluid, and ci = ci(t,x) denotes the concentrations of the chemicals and nutri-\nents. In Eq. (4.1)1, \u03c1j are the mass densities of cellular components and vj is the\nmass velocity of the jth population while v` is the velocity of the liquid. Moreover,\n\u0393j(\u03c1, \u03c6, c) is a source term for the particular component which might include, for\nexample, production and death terms. In Eq. (4.1)2, Qi(\u03c1, \u03c6, c) is the diffusion coef-\nficient of the ith chemical factor, and vi is the velocity of the chemical component.\n\u039bi(\u03c1, \u03c6, c) is the source term for the particular nutrient or chemical, which might\nsimilarly include, for example, production and uptake by the cells. Therefore, the\ncomponent equations are coupled to the chemical equations via the source terms,\n\u039bi(\u03c1, \u03c6, c) and \u0393j(\u03c1, \u03c6, c). For example, blood vessels might be the source of oxygen,\nwhich is consumed by the tumour cells and in turn alters the proliferation or death\nrate of the tumour cells.\nIn some cases, the theory of mixtures is used to describe the tumour\ntissue.13,50,48 The concept behind mixture theory is that at every point there is a\nfraction of each constituent type, unlike a system where at each spatial point there\ncan only be one type of constituent at a time. The model then treats the tumour\nas a multiphase material of cells, ECM and ECF. Hence, the components are rep-\nresented as volume ratios, where \u03c6j represents the volume fraction of a particular\ncomponent. Sometimes the system is assumed to obey the no-voids condition, i.e.\nthe sum of the constituents equals 1.\nIt is crucial to note that the system (4.1) is not a closed or self-consistent sys-\ntem, and therefore by itself it is not a sufficient model. Importantly, one needs\nto determine an equation for the velocity vj in order to close the system. This\nleads to two main classes of macroscopic models, each defined by the choice of\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 611\nmovement term. These classes can be broadly defined as phenomenological mod-\nels or mechanical models. Phenomenological models make an assumption about\nmovement ignoring mechanical effects, such that cells (or matrix components) do\nnot move, or that they move through any combination of diffusion, chemotaxis,\nhaptotaxis, etc. In contrast, mechanical models use force-balance or momentum-\nbalance interactions to determine how the cell, matrix and fluid components move\nin response to the physical forces involved. These mechanistic models take into\naccount stresses and strains to track cellular and tissue deformation. However, these\nmodels also make assumptions about cell movement through the choice of how to\nmodel the tumour tissue, matrix and interstitial fluid (for example, treating the\ntumour as an elastic fluid or porous medium). In reality, it is likely that a com-\nbination of these models of motion is required, as the tumour cells probably use\nactive motility, such as chemotaxis,199 while at the same time responding to physical\nforces.\n4.1.1. Closure by phenomenological models\nIn general, most of the tumour growth models are closed by phenomenological\nassumptions, and an explicit equation for the cellular velocity is written. These\nmodels explicitly specify the nature of the cellular movement, either unbiased or\nbiased. Mathematical models using unbiased models often assume that cells move in\nresponse to population density. For example, early work by Ward and King,194,195\nand Bertuzzi et al.37 assumed cell populations moved as a result of a single convec-\ntive velocity field created through cell proliferation and death driving local volume\nchanges.\nOne common example of a phenomenological closure is to assume cells move\ndown a gradient in cell density, which leads to some type of diffusion equation for\ncell movement. Hence, vj = \u2212Dj\u2207x\u03c6j where in most casesDj is a positive constant,\nhence the movement is simply linear diffusion. This type of approach has proven\nuseful in modelling the spatial spread of many types of populations. However, its\napplicability for interacting constituents is not as clear. Therefore, recent work has\ninvestigated the more general case of Dj = Dj(\u03c6, c) leading to a nonlinear diffusion\nterm.176,186 In a paper by Sherratt,176 a nonlinear diffusion model is used for the\ninteractions between tumour cells and ECM. The model was able to suggest a\nmechanism by which some types of tumours become \u201cencapsulated\u201d by a highly\ndense ECM.\nAn interesting extension of this framework is used in Sherratt and Chaplain173\nwhere they model movement by contact inhibition in avascular tumour growth.\nImportantly, this model also exhibited the traditional avascular tumour structure\nof a proliferating rim, quiescent band, and necrotic core in terms of continuous\ncell densities instead of discrete bands of cell types. Previous models by Ward and\nKing,195 and Greenspan99 have imposed these layers a priori as bands of cell types\nseparated by moving boundaries.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n612 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nAlternatively, phenomenological models can specify biased movement such as\nchemotaxis54 or haptotaxis.15,14 Future models will have the challenge of rigorously\nproving whether, and in which situations, tumour cells move in a haptotactic or\nalternate manner.\nUsing the above framework, numerous papers have been written to study the\ncellular processes driving the macroscopic properties of angiogenesis and invasion.\nFor invasion models, travelling wave analysis is used to examine how the tumour\ninvades the surrounding normal tissue or ECM. Gatenby and Gawlinsky90 utilised\na spatially one-dimensional continuum reaction-diffusion population competition\nmodel based on the observation that nearly all invasive tumours exhibit upregu-\nlated glycolysis (a type of anaerobic respiration which produces lactic acid) even\nin the presence of oxygen. They suggested that the tumour cells create an acidic\nenvironment toxic to normal tissue, and that when the normal tissue dies from the\nhigh acidity, it provides space for the tumour to proliferate and invade into the\nsurrounding tissue. Using a set of reaction\u2013diffusion models, Gatenby and Gawlin-\nsky were able to predict the presence of an acellular gap in certain circumstances,\nwhich was later found experimentally.90,92\nIn contrast to the acid-invasion model, Perumpanani et al.164 suggested a combi-\nnation of ECM degradation by proteases and tumour cell haptotaxis as a mechanism\nfor invasion. They performed a travelling wave analysis on a continuum 1-D ODE\nmodel of invasive cells, ECM and protease. Perumpanani and Byrne163 extended\nthe model to use a combination of diffusion and haptotactic movement, and found\nthat ECM heterogeneity affects invasion.\nAlthough these phenomenological models do an excellent job of approximating\ncellular motion, they fail to take into account mechanical causes of cell movement.\nAs tumour cells proliferate, they push into the surrounding tissue, causing pressure\nto build. This pressure, along with other mechanical interactions, can have a very\nimportant effect on tumour growth and progression.\n4.1.2. Closure in mechanical models\nIn contrast to the above modelling approaches, mechanical models close the sys-\ntem by specifying cell movement based on physical forces. These models aim to\ndescribe how the mechanical properties of the tumour and surrounding tissue influ-\nence tumour growth. In this framework, one would use the same mass-balance equa-\ntions as in Eq. (4.1)1, and continue by writing the momentum balance equations\n\u03c1\u03c6j\n(\n\u2202vj\n\u2202t\n+ vj \u00b7 \u2207xvj\n)\n= Fj [\u03c6,v], j = 1, . . . , L, (4.2)\nfor the constituents, where Fj [\u03c6,v] is a term describing the forces on the constituent\nj. For example, one might express Fj = \u2207x \u00b7Tj+\u03c6jfj+mj , where mj is the inter-\naction force with the other constituents, Tj is the stress\u2013tensor, and fj is the body\nforce acting on the jth constituent. As before, these equations are coupled to the\nnutrients and chemicals in Eq. (4.1)2.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 613\nThe model above requires the specification of the constitutive equations relat-\ning the forces determining cell motion to the level of stress and compression. For\nexample, as a cell undergoes mitosis and divides into two cells, the daughter cells\ngenerate a \u201cpressure\u201d which displaces the neighbouring cells, thus leading to an\nincrease in tumour size. Although it is possible, as a first approximation, to describe\nthe influence of stress on growth through continuum equations, it is clear that it is\npreferential to use a multiscale approach because the perception of stress exerted\nby a single cell and the initiation of mitosis or apoptosis occurs at a subcellular\nscale.\nIn any case, when using a mechanical continuum description, there are several\ndifferent classes of mechanical models depending on whether the cells are assumed\nto behave like a type of fluid or solid medium. If one assumes the cells behave as\na fluid, the simplest constitutive equation for the stress comes from assuming the\ncells act like elastic liquids\nTj = \u2212\u03a3jI, (4.3)\nwhere \u03a3j is the response of the cells to compression, driving them towards regions\nof lower stresses. In practice, \u03a3j may depend on \u03c6j .\nIn some special cases, the assumption of the cells moving as an elastic fluid\nwithin a rigid ECM can lead to closure by Darcy\u2019s law, where if, for example,\nfj = 0,\nvj = \u2212K\u2207x\u03a3j , (4.4)\nwhere K is the permeability property of the matrix. This constitutive equation\nhas two interpretations: the first is that the system acts as an over-damped force\nbalance, the second is that the fluid-like cells flow through the rigid ECM akin to\nporous media flow. See Refs. 63 and 55 with reference to the closure (4.4).\nAlternatively, the cell-matrix milieu can be hypothesised to be like a viscous\nfluid, where the stress depends on the viscosity, as in Breward, Byrne and Lewis,44\nByrne and Preziosi,50 and Byrne et al.,48 or can be modelled as a viscoelastic\nfluid. Holmes and Sleeman108 developed a mechano-chemical model of angiogenesis,\nmodelling the ECM as a linear viscoelastic material, including chemotaxis and\nhaptotaxis of endothelial cells. Their model was able to examine the mechanical\neffects of the ECM on endothelial cell migration, as well as the effects of cellular\ntraction on the ECM deformation and resulting patterns.\nAnother class of models views the tumour tissue as a mixture of cells living in\na porous medium made of ECM and filled with extracellular liquid, see Graziano\nand Preziosi.98 Therefore, Darcy\u2019s law can be used to model both fluid flow and\ncell motion, considering the latter as a granular material flowing in the porous\nECM scaffold. For example, one can write mass and momentum balance for the\ntumour cells (j = T ) and ECF with chemicals and nutrients within it (j = `).\nIf, for example, the mixture has no voids, so that \u03c6T + \u03c6` = 1, then by looking\nat mass and momentum balances for the whole mixture, the following conditions\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n614 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nmust hold:\n\u0393T + \u0393` = 0, (4.5)\nm\u03c3T + \u0393TvT +m\n\u03c3\n` + \u0393`v` = 0, (4.6)\nwhere m\u03c3T and m\n\u03c3\n` are the forces on the tumour and on the extracellular liquid,\nrespectively, due to their interaction with other constituents.\nThe equation for composite velocity, \u03be, is then\n\u2207x \u00b7 \u03be = \u2207x \u00b7 (\u03c6TvT + \u03c6`v`) = 0. (4.7)\nIf the densities of the constituents are equal, then the composite velocity is\nequal to the mass average velocity and the momentum equation for the mixture\nsimplifies to\n\u03c1\n(\n\u2202\u03be\n\u2202t\n+ \u03be \u00b7 \u2207x\u03be\n)\n= \u2207x \u00b7Tm + \u03c6T fT + \u03c6`f`, (4.8)\nwhere Tm is the stress\u2013tensor of the mixture.\nIn this example, as the tissue is treated as a porous medium filled with extra-\ncellular liquid, one can assume Darcy\u2019s law for the fluid flow through the tumour\n\u03c6`(v` \u2212 vT ) = \u2212K(\u2207xP \u2212 f`), (4.9)\nwhere K is the permeability, divided by the viscosity of the fluid, of the tissue\ninterstitial space and P is the local interstitial fluid pressure. Neglecting inertial\nterms and assuming the constitutive equation\nTm = \u2212[P +\u03a3T ]I, (4.10)\nwith \u03a3T positive in compression, the momentum equation for the mixture implies\n\u2207xP = \u2212\u03a3\u2032T\u2207x\u03c6T + \u03c6T fT + \u03c6`f`, (4.11)\nwhere \u03a3\u2032T = d\u03a3T \/d\u03c6T .\nOn the other hand,\nv` = vT \u2212 K(1\u2212 \u03c6T ) (\u2207xP \u2212 f`) = vT +\nK\n(1\u2212 \u03c6T ) [\u03a3\n\u2032\nT\u2207x\u03c6T +\u03c6T (f`\u2212 fT )], (4.12)\nwhich can be substituted back into the composite velocity equation to yield\n\u2207x \u00b7 {vT +K[\u03a3\u2032T\u2207x\u03c6T + \u03c6T (f` \u2212 fT )]} = 0. (4.13)\nFor example, the case of a multicell spheroid as a growing poro-elastic medium\ncan thus be written using the mass balance equation Eq. (4.1)1, the momen-\ntum equation (4.11), the composite velocity equation (4.13), along with suitable\nreaction\u2013diffusion nutrient equations from Eq. (4.1)2.\nThis framework has been used by Ambrosi and Mollica,12 Roose et al.169\ntogether with experimental data to show how tumour cell size is reduced by solid\nstress inside tumour spheroids. Ambrosi and Preziosi,13 followed by Byrne and\nPreziosi,50 modelled avascular tumour as a deformable porous medium in which\nthe solid skeleton was assumed to be comprised of deformable cells bathed in\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 615\nextracellular liquid containing nutrients, and included in the mass exchange between\nthe solid and liquid constituents. It also included the viscous effects of cellular\nmotion. This model was able to determine the stress distribution within the tumour,\nand how the stresses affected proliferation rates and tumour size.\nIn general, continuous models are able to exhibit the general behaviour\nof tumour growth, angiogenesis and invasion. However, all of these continuum\napproaches model average behaviour at a population level, and fail to examine\nphenomena that occur at the single cell level. This makes detailed modelling of\nprocesses such as angiogenesis difficult, as simply calculating average cell density\nfails to include the specific spatial structure of the vascular network. Furthermore, it\nis unclear if processes such as invasion and metastasis are driven by \u201caverage\u201d pop-\nulation behaviour, or instead by cells which deviate from the mean. It is certainly\npossible that individual \u201crogue\u201d cells drive the macroscopic processes of invasion\nor metastasis, and their behaviour would not be captured in a continuum model.\nIn these cases, a discrete modelling approach must be taken in order to keep track\nof each individual cell.\n4.2. Discrete models\nUnlike continuum models, discrete models have the ability to track the behaviour\nof single cells. Due to biotechnological advances, there is an increasing amount of\ndata available on phenomena at a single cell level which merit inclusion in mathe-\nmatical models. These discrete approaches model single-cell scale phenomena and\nuse upscaling techniques to examine the effect on macroscopic properties of the\ntumour.\nMost discrete models utilise a combination of discrete cell-based models (such as\ncellular automata,177,178,7,67 extended Potts,189 random walk,15,14 among others) to\nrepresent the behaviour of single cells, and continuous equations to model chemical\ngradients. Individual cells are then tracked on a lattice, where the cells of the lattice\ncorrespond to biological cells (as in cellular automata and random walk models) or\neach cell is made up of several lattice points (as in Potts models). The particular\nchoice of lattice can be extremely important, and care must be taken to ensure that\nmacroscopic properties are not driven by the specific structure of the lattice affecting\ncell movement. Also, the \u201cneighbourhood\u201d used to determine cell proliferation and\nmovement (such as at which adjacent spaces a daughter cell can be placed) can affect\nthe model behaviour. For example, on a 2-D rectangular lattice, a von Neumann\nneighbourhood includes the four spaces located north, south, east, and west of\na given cell, while the Moore neighbourhood uses eight adjacent cells. Usually,\na discrete model is comprised of a regular rectangular lattice for computational\nsimplicity, however alternative geometries can be chosen. Furthermore, the lattice\nis usually fixed through time, but a free lattice can be constructed to move as a\nresult of cell proliferation.\nAll of the main discrete models consider the state of each cell or populations of\ncells to be characterised by the vector variable w = {x,v,u}, where x is position,\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n616 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nv is velocity, and u is a vector detailing the cell\u2019s internal state, which might\ninclude information such as age, point in cell cycle, phenotypic characteristics, etc.\nThis information would in turn affect the probability of a cell moving, proliferating,\nor changing state. In some cases, continuous models for cell density are discretised,\nusually using finite difference methods, providing transition rates for cells moving to\nan adjacent site. This can allow for the inclusion of stochastic effects. As in contin-\nuum models, assumptions regarding cell movement can be implemented, either by\nusing phenomenological models such as diffusion or haptotaxis, or mechanical mod-\nels. Any mechanical interactions would depend on the cell\u2019s position and velocity.\nOne advantage of this discrete method is the ease of embedding subcellular\nprocesses within each biological cell (which usually corresponds to an automaton\ncell). For example, the model can track each individual cell, and within each cell\nthe simulation can run continuous mathematical models of metabolism or cell cycle.\nThis potential for use as a multi-scale framework will be discussed in detail in Sec. 6.\nIn particular, a discrete approach is useful when modelling angiogenesis, as it\nallows modelling at the individual cell and vessel level. In this way, mathemati-\ncal models can examine how endothelial cells link together and form functional\nblood vessels, and the precise structure of the vascular network. Anderson and\nChaplain15 began by simply examining endothelial sprout tips and the initiation of\nbranching. Levine et al.128,126 used reinforced random walks to examine angiogenic\nsignalling, ECM degradation and subsequent migration of endothelial cells towards\nthe tumour. Extensions of these models will be discussed further in Sec. 6.\nDiscrete models have also addressed the importance of visco-elastic effects and\ncell adhesion, with a focus on tumour invasion. Although the basics of tumour\ngrowth and movement into the surrounding tissue can be examined through contin-\nuum models (and in particular travelling wave solutions176,133), advances in imaging\nnow allow us to visualise migration of individual cells and it has been suggested\nthat perhaps single cell behaviour, in contrast to mean cell behaviour, might be\ndriving invasion. Therefore, discrete modelling techniques are better suited to rep-\nresent these aspects of tumour growth. In order to address these issues, Turner and\nSherratt189 used a discrete extended Potts model to investigate adhesion, prote-\nolysis and haptotaxis using a thermodynamic approach of energy minimisation in\na model of tumour invasion. This model was able to examine the relative impor-\ntance of cell\u2013cell adhesion and cell\u2013matrix adhesion. Furthermore, recent work by\nAnderson et al.16 utilises a hybrid discrete model incorporating cell-adhesion, cell-\nmigration and phenotypic mutations, and suggests invasive \u201cfingering\u201d is driven by\nenvironmental heterogeneity. This model is described in detail in Sec. 6.\n4.3. From cellular to macroscopic models\nThe various models reviewed in the preceding sections have been derived accord-\ning to the classical approach of continuum mechanics, namely by using mass and\nmomentum conservation equations properly closed by phenomenological models\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 617\ncorresponding to the material behaviour of the system. This approach is docu-\nmented in the various chapters of the book,146 containing lectures on the derivation\nof several models of biological tissues. Different models are obtained according to\nthe different ways chosen to close the conservation and equilibrium equations.\nOn the other hand, the macroscopic behaviour should be properly related to the\ndynamics at the cellular level. In other words, macroscopic models should be derived\nfrom the underlying cellular models by suitable asymptotic methods developed by\nletting intercellular distances tend to those of the tissue level.\nThe above approach is widely studied in the case of classical particles by asymp-\ntotic methods developed in mathematical kinetic theory. In recent years, the anal-\nysis of the applicability of asymptotic methods has reached an important devel-\nopment in the so-called parabolic and hyperbolic limits or equivalently low and\nhigh field limits. The parabolic (low field) limit of kinetic equations leads to a\ndrift\u2013diffusion type system (or reaction\u2013diffusion system) in which the diffusion\nprocesses dominate the behaviour of the solutions.\nThe specialised literature offers a number of recent contributions concerning\nvarious limits for parabolic diffusive models and the hyperbolic (high field) limit\nwhere the influence of the diffusion terms is of lower (or equal) order of magni-\ntude in comparison with other convective or interaction terms. Therefore, different\nmacroscopic models are obtained corresponding to different scaling assumptions.\nThe literature in the field of asymptotic methods for classical particles is docu-\nmented in the review papers by Villani,191 Perthame,161 Lachowicz124 and Bonilla\nand Soler.42\nThe same methodological approach can be developed starting from multicellular\nmodels obtained by methods of generalised kinetic theory. Although the literature\non this topic is not as vast as that for classical particles, a number of interesting\nresults are available. On the other hand, several technical difficulties arise from\nthe fact that particles are elements of inert matter, while cells are active particles\nbelonging to living matter. In particular:\n(i) The microscopic state of an active particle is characterised not only by position\nand velocity, but also by an additional microscopic state (we may call it activity)\nwhich represents biological function at a cellular level.\n(ii) Microscopic interactions not only modify the microscopic state, but may also\ngenerate proliferative and\/or destructive phenomena.\nTechnically, asymptotic methods amount to expanding the distribution function\nin terms of a small dimensionless parameter related to the intermolecular distances\n(the space-scale dimensionless parameter) that is equivalent to the connections\nbetween the biological constants. The limit that we obtain is singular and the con-\nvergence properties can be proved under suitable technical assumptions. In these\npapers biological systems are considered for which interactions do not follow classi-\ncal mechanical rules, and biological activity may play a relevant role in determining\nthe dynamics.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n618 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nThe paper by Othmer, Dunbar and Alt151 is arguably the first one where\nthis topic was addressed. Subsequent contributions in this area are due to vari-\nous authors.20\u201324,56,57,70,78,79,125,152,153 The above-cited papers deal with a variety\nof models of the kinetic theory of cellular systems corresponding to the modelling of\ncell interactions that are relevant in the biological system under consideration. The\nstructure of the equations for tissue behaviour depends again on the predominance\nof one of the three aspects of the biological dynamics, i.e. encounter rate between\ncells, mutations, and proliferative\/destructive events, with respect to the other two.\nMoreover, the structure of the mathematical equations modelling tissues may evolve\nin time due to the aforementioned dynamics. So far, the formal approach provides\na range of structurally different macroscopic equations whose specific form depends\non which of the above aspects of biological dynamics is assumed predominant.\nAsymptotic methods have been applied to the following class of equations that\nmodel the evolution of the distribution function defined in Sec. 3.3. Specifically,\nmathematical results have been derived for models where the space dynamics is\nobtained by adding to the spatially homogeneous model a stochastic perturbation\nfor the velocity.152 Referring to the class of equations reviewed in Sec. 3.3, the\nmodel in absence of external action, can be written as follows:\n\u2202tf(t,x,v, u) + v \u00b7 \u2207xfi(t,x,v, u)\n= L[f ](t,x,v, u) + C[f ](t,x,v, u) +D[f ](t,x,v, u), (4.14)\nwhere C[f ] and D[f ] correspond, respectively, to conservative and proliferative\/\ndestructive interactions (in the absence of proliferation, due to genetic mutations,\ninto a population different from that of the interacting cells). Moreover,\nL[f ] =\n\u222b\nDv\n[\nT (v,v\u2217)f(t,x,v\u2217, u)\u2212 T (v\u2217,v)f(t,x,v, u)\n]\ndv\u2217 (4.15)\nmodels a linear velocity-jump process, where \u03bd is the turning rate or turning fre-\nquency (hence \u03c4 = 1\u03bd is the mean run time) and T (v,v\u2217) is the probability kernel\nfor the new velocity v \u2208 Dv assuming that the previous velocity was v\u2217. This cor-\nresponds to the assumption that cells choose any direction with bounded velocity.\nSpecifically, the set of possible velocities is denoted by Dv, where Dv \u2282 R3, and it is\nassumed that Dv is bounded and spherically symmetric (i.e. v \u2208 Dv \u21d2 \u2212v \u2208 Dv).\nFurther, notation dv stands for integration over three-dimensional velocity space.\nLet us first consider the hyperbolic scaling corresponding to:\nt\u2192 \u03b5 t, x\u2192 \u03b5x \u21d2 t \u03bd = 1\n\u03b5\n, (4.16)\nand introduce the parameters\n\u03bd =\n1\n\u03b5\n, \u03b7 = \u03b5q\u22121, \u00b5 = \u03b5\u03b4, q \u2265 1, \u03b4 \u2265 0. (4.17)\nTherefore, the scaled non-dimensional model takes the form:\n(\u2202t + v \u00b7 \u2207x)f\u03b5 = 1\n\u03b5\n(L(f\u03b5) + \u03b5qC(f\u03b5, f\u03b5) + \u03b5q+\u03b4D(f\u03b5, f\u03b5)). (4.18)\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 619\nThe approaches in the literature are limited to the above class of models, while\nthe case of proliferation related to genetic mutations has not yet been addressed.\nThe derivation needs the following assumptions:\nAssumption 4.1. (Solvability conditions) The turning operator L satisfies, in the\nwhole physical space, the following solvability conditions:\u222b\nDv\nL(f)(v) dv = 0,\n\u222b\nDv\nvL(f)(v) dv = 0, (4.19)\nwhere L(f) is the linear operator, corresponding to (4.15), acting on f (the argu-\nments t and x have been dropped to simplify notation), and integration is over the\nwhole velocity space.\nAssumption 4.2.

(4.25)\nThe following assumption is needed:\nAssumption 4.3.

Additional examples and\nvarious applications are reported in Refs. 20, 21 and 23.\n4.4. Moving boundary models\nIn the above, we have shown how the macroscopic description of biological tis-\nsues can be obtained either by the classical approach of continuum mechanics or,\nmaybe more appropriately, by suitable hydrodynamic limits applied to the under-\nlying microscopic description at the cellular level. Moreover, it has been shown that\ndifferent mathematical models, namely parabolic, hyperbolic, or simply evolution\nequations, can be obtained corresponding either to different closures of the con-\nservation equations in the continuum mechanical approach, or to different ratios\nbetween the mechanical and biological timescales.\nOne of the most relevant applications of continuum models is the study of\nmoving boundary problems wherein it is assumed that growth of solid tumours\noccurs in an environment where nutrients nurture their development in the face of\nchemical factors that inhibit growth, while other agents, for example, the immune\nsystem and macrophages, are also involved in growth arrest.\nThe above approach is documented in several papers.36,37,59,63,86,85,58,131,129\nThe essential concepts were first reported in the pioneering papers by Greenspan99\nand Adam.2,54,4 Further references will be given in Sec. 7 in connection with the\nreview of some challenging mathematical problems generated by the study of mov-\ning boundary problems.\nThis subsection presents various aspects of the methodological approach. We\nrefer the reader to the paper by De Angelis and Preziosi63 for full technical details.\nIn particular, we focus on some critical conceptual difficulties that arise. Some of\nthese have already been addressed, as will be described in Sec. 6.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n622 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nThe biological system is represented in Figures 2 and 3 schematically:\nT is the inner zone of the solid tumour;\nD is the domain of the outer environment;\n\u2202T is the boundary separating T from D.\nTo make the model tractable, the geometry is simplified. For example, in the\nsimplest cases T is assumed to be spherical, cylindrical or even one-dimensional.\nThe second step consists of identifying the macroscopic variables that can pos-\nsibly describe the state of the overall system viewed as a continuum and then\ndeveloping a strategy to reduce the complexity related to the large number of com-\nponents to a limited number of variables. For instance, still referring to the above\ncited paper,63 the following variables are selected:\n\u2014 the density u1 of living tumour cells;\n\u2014 the density u2 of necrotic tumour cells;\n\u2014 the concentration u3 of the factor that inhibits tumour growth;\n\u2014 the concentration u4 of the factor that activates angiogenesis;\n\u2014 the density u5 of endothelial cells;\n\u2014 the concentration u6 of nutrient.\nThe above variables represent an overall system which is much more complex\nwith a greater number of components. Reduction is achieved by grouping in each\nvariable the collective behaviour of several cooperative actions. Specifically, the\nvariables u1 and u2 are defined in T , while u3, u4, u5 and u6 are defined in the\nwhole domain T \u222aD.\nThe mathematical models in the domains T and D consist of systems of PDEs\nderived according to the modelling of the following, briefly described, biological\nphenomena:\nMitosis occurs only if tumour cells receive a sufficient quantity of nutrient, greater\nthan that needed for survival. On the other hand, division can be inhibited by\nmitotic inhibitors. When the nutrient levels are too low, cells undergo necrosis.\nMovement of cells occurs towards zones of lower cell density, while necrotic tumour\ncells do not move and naturally disintegrate.\nEndothelial cells proliferate with a rate dependent on the chemical factors emitted\nby tumour cells to activate angiogenesis. Capillary sprouts further facilitate the\ndiffusion of nutrients.\nProteins, named angiostatins, have the ability to reduce the proliferation of\nendothelial cells and hence reduce angiogenesis.\nThe aforementioned system of PDEs is coupled on the free boundary \u2202\u2126 by suit-\nable compatibility conditions generally described by ordinary differential equations.\nThe paper63 describes in detail how the above biological considerations are\nconverted into a specific mathematical model. Several papers, such as those cited\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 623\nin this subsection, report technical variations corresponding to different biological\nsituations, while mathematical problems generated by the applications of models\nto the analysis of tumour progression are reviewed in Sec. 7 below.\n5. From Genetic Mutations to Onset of Cancer Phenotype\nAs we have mentioned, to implement modelling at the cellular scale, we require\ninformation on cell function that arises from the dynamics at the intracellular\n(molecular) level. This information is also necessary for models at the macroscopic\nscale because the whole system is driven, to some extent, by genetic mutations. (Of\ncourse, this is a simplified view as it ignores feed-back down the spatial scales.) This\nsection deals with modelling approaches at the microscopic (genetic) scale focused\nto extract, from the lower scale, the above-mentioned inputs to the higher scales.\nThe paper by Vogelstein and Kinzler192 is an essential reference to understand\nhow the over-expression and under-expression of certain genes can generate the\nanomalous behaviour of cells leading to the onset of neoplasia followed by clonal\nexpansion. Quoting the above-cited paper\nAlterations in three types of genes are responsible for tumourigenesis: oncogenes,\ntumour-suppressor genes, and stability genes.\nOncogenes are mutated in ways that render the gene constitutively active or\nactive under conditions in which the wild-type gene is not. Oncogene activations\ncan result from chromosomal translocations, from gene amplifications or from subtle\nintragenic mutations affecting crucial residues that regulate the activity of the gene\nproduct.\nTumour-suppressor genes are targeted in the opposite way by genetic alterations:\nmutations reduce the activity of the gene product. Such inactivations arise from\nmissense mutations at residues that are essential for its activity, from mutations\nthat result in a truncated protein, from deletions or insertions of various sizes, or\nfrom epigenetic silencing.\nA third class of cancer genes, called stability genes or caretakers, promotes\ntumorigenesis in a completely different way when mutated. This class includes mis-\nmatch repair, nucleotide-excision repair and base-excision repair genes responsible\nfor repairing subtle mistakes made during normal DNA replication or induced by\nexposure to mutagens.\nAccording to the above literature, it is well established that the onset of cancer\nis caused by under- or over-expression of those genes which are responsible for\ntumourigenesis. This can occur during DNA replication, when a cell does not have\nsufficient ability to repair DNA corruption. It can also be caused by interaction\nwith other genes, or with the external environment. Stochastic events are typical\nin the phenomena under consideration.97\nThe molecular biology literature on the above topic is vast. The interested reader\nis referred to the review paper by Vogelstein and Kinzler,192 or to the book by\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n624 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nWeinberg.197 The review by Baylin and Ohm19 reports on the role of gene activa-\ntion and silencing in carcinogenesis, while the role of genetic therapies is reported\nin the paper by Mezhir et al.142 (see also the review by Futreal et al.89). While\nlarge strides have been made biologically, the mathematical approaches are still at\na preliminary stage.\nEssentially, the mathematical literature has been devoted to modelling gene\ninteractions and their evolution. Although a systematic approach is not yet avail-\nable, some interesting results have already appeared. Two mathematical approaches\nare examined below: the first one is due to Komarova,120\u2013122 while the second one\nis by Gatenby et al.,95,96 both dealing with different aspects of the problem (see\nalso Tiuryn, Wo\u00b4jtowicz and Rudnicki188 and Michor, Iwasa and Nowak145). An\nimportant reference is the recently published book by Frank.84\nKomarova\u2019s approach is focused on the stochastic dynamics of gene interac-\ntion in cancer initiation and progression related to mutations which generate loss\nand gain of function. She shows how cumulative mutations can lead to tumour\nprogression.\nAn interesting aspect of this approach is the development of some preliminary\nideas to relate some of the relevant functions of cells to the dynamics of genes. The\nnext step is to develop Komarova\u2019s ideas to look for the link between the molecular\nand cellular scales. The basic idea consists of developing a stochastic game theory93\nas the essential tool to model the output of gene interaction. Technical developments\nbased on a deeper insight into stochastic dynamics of gene interactions are presented\nin the paper by Tiuryn, Wo\u00b4jtowicz and Rudnicki.188\nRelatively simpler models assume that cancer mutations can be described by a\ndeterministic description using ordinary differential equations.180 A deeper insight\ninto the dynamics at the molecular level is necessary to capture the essence of the\ncomplexity of the system viewed as an evolutionary and ecological process.140\nIn general, the derivation of a model suitable for describing the time evolution\nof gene activation and silencing, due to gene interaction and action from the micro-\nenvironment, remains a challenging and fascinating open problem. A successful\napproach should also lead to incorporating the subsequent influence on biological\nfunctions expressed by cells as the natural input to models developed at the cellular\nscale.\nThe mathematical approach proposed by Gatenby94\u201396,174,175 is essentially\nbased on the idea that the onset of tumourigenesis is an evolutionary process where\ncells follow a Darwinian interaction of altered cellular genotypes with changing\nmicro-environment.16 Gatenby, Vincent and Gilies96 propose a population compe-\ntition model where the \u201cwinners\u201d are determined by their phenotypic fitness rela-\ntive to other populations in the environment. Winners proliferate at the expense of\nlosers, while phenotypic properties are retained or lost depending on their contri-\nbution to individual fitness. The model consists of a system of ordinary differential\nequations where gain and loss terms are phenomenologically modelled according to\nthe above interaction dynamics.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 625\nVarious authors have proposed that evolutionary processes play a crucial role\nin biological modifications at the cellular scale with a timescale much shorter than\nthe one needed for mutations at the species level. Nowak and Sigmund149 state:\nevolutionary game theory is an essential component of a mathematical and compu-\ntational approach to biology.\nThe above phenomenological description and theoretical approaches motivate\nphysicists to look at the use of generalisations of the classical methods of statistical\nand quantum mechanics. The conjecture proposed in paper29 suggests developing\nat the molecular scale some ideas already exploited at the cellular scale. In other\nwords, the conjecture is to use structures (3.7)\u2013(3.11) to describe the dynamics\nat the molecular scale and derive, out of this dynamics, the above main cellular\ninteraction terms.\nIn this case, the internal microscopic variable is gene expression, the overall\nstate of the system is described by the distribution function over this state, while\nthe gain and loss terms should refer both to interactions between genes and with\nthe external environment. Onset of instability, referred to as oncogenesis, then leads\nto carcinogenesis.\n6. Complexity Analysis and Multiscale Modelling\nAs already mentioned several times, tumourigenesis is a multiscale phenomenon.\nFigure 4 is an attempt to capture, in a schematic representation, the essence of the\nmultiscale nature of the system under consideration, illustrating that cellular and\nmolecular events continue to play a crucial role in the temporal evolution of the\ntumour throughout its development.\nFig. 4. Schematic multiscale representation of tumour growth: gene interactions (stochastic\ngames), cells (kinetic theory), tissues (continuum mechanics), mixed (hybrid models).\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n626 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nMultiscale analysis involves various aspects of the modelling approach. In par-\nticular, mathematical models at a certain scale need to be consistent with the lower\nand higher scales. In other words, models at the tissue level (macroscopic) have to\nbe obtained by suitable asymptotic methods from the underlying cellular (micro-\nscopic) scale, while parameters of models at the cellular scale should be identified\nfrom the lower molecular scale. Moreover, the overall system can be regarded as a\nnetwork of several interacting subsystems, each developed at a specific scale, while\ninteractions between contiguous systems need to deal with compatibility conditions\n(in some cases boundary conditions) at each specific scale. The above issues will be\nanalysed later after an overview on the existing literature.\nAlthough a systematic development of multiscale approaches is very recent,\nsome papers already anticipate the need for dealing with a modelling approach\nsuitable to account for different scales. For instance, the role of cellular dynamics\non the rough surface of solid tumours is studied in Refs. 45 and 46. Experimental\nevidence shows that the dynamics at the cellular scale can play a relevant role on\nthe evolution of solid tumours (continuum mechanics). The paper by Levine, Slee-\nman and Nilsen-Hamilton127 includes within a macroscopic approach a network of\nseveral phenomena at the cellular level such as cellular penetration and formation of\ncapillary sprouts. Random walk methods141 are introduced to deal with two scales\nof diffusion. The role of cell adhesion (cellular scale) on angiogenesis analysed at\nthe macroscopic scale is dealt with in Refs. 15 and 139. The coupling of models\nat the cellular scale to identify the tissue properties of models at the macroscopic\nscale is studied by Marchiniak-Cozchra and Kimmel134,136,139 in an analysis of the\nearly stages of tumour growth.\nOne of the first papers to introduce a systematic approach to a multiscale mod-\nelling of the overall system viewed as a system of systems is arguably due to Alarcon,\nByrne and Maini7 for vascular tumours. This initial model has been extended con-\nsiderably in a subsequent series of papers.9,49,10 The focus of these papers is on\nmodelling vascular tumour growth, incorporating subcellular cell cycle processes,\ncellular interactions, macroscopic properties of the vascular network and invasive\npatterning.\nIn their earlier paper,7 Alarcon, Byrne and Maini used a cellular automaton to\nmodel the effect of vascular dynamics on competition between normal and tumour\ncells. They formulated a model of vascular adaptation based on hydrodynamic prin-\nciples and known features of vascular adaptation, such as change in vessel radius.\nThe model also included elements of blood rheology and haematocrit and incorpo-\nrated the dependence of blood viscosity on haematocrit and vessel radius. At each\ntime step of the cellular automaton, the oxygen distribution and vascular network\nproperties were calculated, and then the states of the normal and tumour cells (such\nas quiescent, proliferative, etc.) were determined based on local oxygen levels.\nIn subsequent papers, subcellular cell-cycle models were included, such that\ninside each cell was a set of ODEs representing the progression through cell-\ncycle phases due to nutrient availability and kinease activity.8 In this way, they\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 627\nformulated a multiscale model integrating the vascular, cellular and intracellular\nlevels: the vascular network responds to chemical stimuli produced at the cellu-\nlar level and the nutrient distribution provided by the vasculature affects cellular\n(apoptosis, quiescence, etc) and subcellular (production of VEGF, expression of\np53) processes. With each subsequent paper, they have been able to incorporate an\nincreasingly complex level of interaction and feedback between the various scales.\nFigure 5, from the paper by Betteridge et al.,38 details one example of this type of\ninteracting network between the various spatial scales.\nVery few multiscale models have attempted to include genetic mutations. Small-\nbone et al.175 examined the development of ductal carcinoma in situ, and how\nthe micro-environment could effect the somatic evolution of cancer cells towards\nglycolytic and acid-resistant phenotypes. Their model allowed reversible herita-\nble mutations which affect survival and proliferation (such as the ability to grow\naway from the basement membrane, the ability to upregulate glycolysis in hypoxic\nenvironments, and the ability to survive acidic regions). This model has made\nexperimentally verifiable predictions of nodular growth of constitutively upregu-\nlated glycolytic populations.94\nAnother notable multiscale model using phenotypic mutations is due to Ander-\nson et al.16 They also use a hybrid model, examining the interaction between cellular\nand micro-environmental factors. Their model links the environment and nutrient\navailability to phenotypic mutations which alter a single cell\u2019s phenotypic traits\nrelated to proliferation, cell\u2013cell adhesion, oxygen consumption, movement, etc.\nPDEs are used to represent the oxygen, matrix degradative enzymes and ECM.\nWithin this model, cells are allowed to evolve and change their phenotype through\nFig. 5. Multiscale interactions of vascular tumour growth (from Betteridge et al.39). See text\n(and the original paper) for fuller details.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n628 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nheritable mutations gained or lost during proliferation. Two different mutation\nschemes were used in the simulations, a linear scheme where the cells could mutate\nto more and more aggressive phenotypes, and another random scheme where they\ncould \u201cjump\u201d randomly between 100 pre-selected phenotypes, ignoring the parent\nphenotype. Interestingly, both mutation schemes yielded similar results, one where\nthe tumour evolves towards an increasingly aggressive phenotype, with higher pro-\nliferation, lower cell\u2013cell adhesion and higher matrix degradation.\nThe main focus of the Anderson et al. paper,16 however, was the importance\nof the environment in tumour progression. By varying the environmental condi-\ntions (such as manipulating oxygen concentration throughout the simulation or\nchanging the underlying matrix) the model predicted that a harsh tumour environ-\nment exerts a selective force which results in an invasive, fingering tumour which\nis dominated by a few clones of the most aggressive phenotype. However, homo-\ngeneous, well-oxygenated environments produce more rounded tumours with less\nfingering infiltration and selection of less aggressive phenotypes. The implications\nfor tumour treatment are clear: treatments which provide a hostile environment in\norder to kill the tumour may, in fact, be creating a strong selection pressure towards\nmore aggressive, more invasive tumours.\nAn alternate multiscale modelling framework has been developed by Kim, Sto-\nlarska and Othmer116 in a recently published paper on in vitro tumour spheroid\ngrowth. The previous approaches discussed16,7\u20139 have both used lattice-based dis-\ncrete models for the cells in the simulation. However, this quickly presents a serious\ncomputational problem, as even a tumour spheroid with a diameter of 2mm con-\ntains approximately 2\u00d7106 cells. Multiscale models wherein each of these cells also\ncontains a system of ODEs modelling the cell cycle, and each of the cells mechan-\nically interacts with each other, very quickly become computationally intractable.\nTo address this computational problem, Kim et al.116 formulated a model which\nonly treats the rapidly proliferating rim region as discrete, while using a continuum\nmodel to describe the remaining quiescent and necrotic regions, as well as the sur-\nrounding gel or matrix. Their reasoning is that only the mechanical properties of the\nquiescent, necrotic and gel regions are important to spheroid growth, hence these\nregions can simply be described by continuum equations. Therefore, there are four\nregions in the model: the necrotic core, the quiescent zone, the proliferating rim and\nthe surrounding gel or matrix. The continuum gel, quiescent, and necrotic regions\nare assumed to be homogeneous materials, but with different mechanical proper-\nties. In the proliferating zone, variations in cell-cycle time, cell-size, metabolic state,\nmobility, etc. are all crucial to tumour formation and therefore are described by a\ndiscrete (individual-based) model. This novel hybrid model can still address single\ncell\u2013cell adhesion and invasive patterning in the proliferative zone, while simplify-\ning computationally the overall system, as the proliferating zone is only comprised\nof a few hundred cells.\nThe forces on each particular cell in their model consist of the active force\nexerted on neighbouring cells or substrate, the reactive force due to forces exerted\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 629\nfrom other cells on it, the static frictional force due to cell\u2013cell or cell\u2013matrix\nadhesion, and the dynamic drag forces arising from breaking adhesive bonds with\nneighbouring cells during movement. Individual proliferating cells are treated as\noriented ellipses which can grow and deform due to external forces. The cytoplasm\nis modelled as an incompressible viscoelastic solid and the continuum regions are\ntreated as linear viscoelastic materials with different material properties.\nThe model is able to exhibit some experimentally observed behaviours, such\nas the existence of a constant thickness proliferating rim (of about 100 microns),\nindependent of the stiffness of the gel. Furthermore, it accurately predicts that gel\nstiffness affects tumour growth rate. Although in a preliminary stage, this approach\nprovides an excellent framework for a computationally tractable model of tumour\ngrowth which includes mechanical forces and intracellular dynamics. The computa-\ntional grid in the case of avascular tumour is represented in Fig. 6, from the paper\nby Kim, Stolarska and Othmer.116\nOther authors have followed a multiscale approach to model the overall system\nas a network of several interacting subsystems corresponding to different biological\nsituations, e.g. avascular tumours.111,116 It is well known that applied mathemati-\ncians are strongly attracted by the above approach, so that it is expected that\nmany variations on this theme will soon appear. A critique on the selection of\nmathematical models to be used at each scale can be found in the survey paper.26\nThe above-cited papers9,49,10 have the merit of having defined the method-\nological aspects of multiscale modelling, where the overall system can be viewed\nas a system of interacting subsystems, each of which is localised in a well-defined\nFig. 6.

Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\ndomain. In some cases, two (or more) different systems occupy the same domain.\nAs can be seen, the above approach divides the modelling into four sub-processes:\n6.1 The decomposition of the whole system into subsystems should be related to\nthe theory of modules,103 so that each subsystem is related to a well-defined main\nbiological function.\n6.2 Each subsystem (module) has to be localised in a well-defined domain Di, in\ncontact with other domains within the overall domain D, where D = \u222ami=1Di. The\nnumber of subsystems may be greater than the number of domains m as more than\none subsystem can be localised in the same domain.\n6.3 A model of each subsystem can be derived at one of the three scales described in\nSec. 2. The space variable can, for some specific models, be characterised by discrete\ndirections as visualised on the right-hand side of Fig. 4. Models of each subsystem\nmay be developed, as documented in Ref. 7, by using a hybrid approach.67\n6.4 The overall implementation of the model needs to be completed by modelling\ninteractions of subsystems within the same domain and by compatibility conditions,\nin some cases to be regarded as boundary conditions, between models located in\ntwo contiguous domains.\nSome speculations are developed in what follows for each of the above issues.\nThe discussion is motivated both by the existing literature in the field and by the\nvarious examples reported in the preceding sections.\n6.1. Decomposition into subsystems as modules\nThe complexity of the system is such that all the components cannot be included\nif we wish to develop practical models. One possible approach to deal with this\n\u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d is the theory of modules proposed by Hartwell et al.,103\nwherein each subsystem is regarded as a module, according to the specific biological\nfunctions expressed by the cooperative action of various entities.\nIt is interesting to observe that the identification of the aforementioned functions\nmay depend, at least in some cases, on the particular phenomena that are under\nstudy. Consequently, the decomposition of the system into modules is not unique,\nbut depends on the biological phenomena that are being analysed. The modular\napproach is motivated in the brief note by Herrero,104 while it is related to Hartwell\net al.\u2019s theory in various papers dealing with models at the cellular level.28,29\n6.2. Localisation of modules\nLocalisation of modules is a necessary step for the statement of mathematical prob-\nlems. Two specific cases generally appear:\n(i) Each module Mi occupies a well defined domain Di, so that the number m of\nmodules is equal to the number of domains corresponding to the decomposition\nof the whole domain;\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 631\n(ii) More than one module, say Mhi and M\nk\ni , is localised in the domain Di. There-\nfore, the number of modules is greater than the number of domains.\nThe mathematical models corresponding to each domain-module are generally\nderived at a specific scale in each domain.\n6.3. Scaling and hybrid systems\nAs already mentioned, models at different scales correspond to different modules.\nFor instance, the assembly of the entire model (in some cases, a network) can\nbe constituted by models at the molecular scale, interacting with models at the\ncellular or macroscopic scale. Similarly, models at the cellular scale may interact\nwith models at the macroscopic scale.\nWhile a systematic approach to scaling does not yet exist in the literature,\nthere are some particular applications that provide a useful background for its\ndevelopment. Some specific examples are briefly described below and are critically\nanalysed in view of the statement of key mathematical problems.\n6.4. Compatibility and boundary conditions\nThe well-posedness of mathematical problems for a system constituted by several\ninteracting modules requires the necessary initial and boundary conditions for each\nmodel related to each module. This aspect has been dealt with in the various\napplications reviewed above. The analysis of the difficulty of the problem and some\nsuggestions are now proposed in a general context.\n6.4.1. Compatibility conditions on boundaries\nThe statement of boundary conditions on the surface of separation between two con-\ntiguous domains needs to be related to the compatibility conditions that describe\nthe state in each domain. In some cases the relation may be nonlinear. One approach\nto this problem has been addressed by Kim, Stolarska and Othmer et al.,116 who\nconsider compatibility conditions between the continuum tissue, discrete prolifer-\nating region, continuum quiescent and necrotic regions as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe variables describing the states of the systems may refer to different scales,\nfor instance macroscopic and cellular. Therefore, compatibility conditions between\nboundaries may need to transfer the variable from one scale to the other. Specif-\nically, macroscopic information from the cellular scale is simply obtained by\nmoments, so that compatibility conditions refer to functions of moments. This\napproach is sufficient going from the cellular to the macroscopic scales, while it\nis not so for the reverse direction.\n6.4.2. Compatibility conditions inside a module\nAlternatively, variables describing different scales may exist within the same mod-\nule. These variables may need compatibility conditions which are different from\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n632 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nthose needed on the boundaries of the model, or between modules as described\nabove. Instead, compatibility conditions between scales within a single module may\ninvolve taking asymptotic limits and finding matching conditions. For example, a\nmodel of angiogenesis might have different equations describing the vascular net-\nwork at each scale (such as at the capillary, grid and tissue levels). Therefore, the\nequations which describe single capillaries would need to have matching conditions\nat the asymptotic limit to the equations describing those of the capillary network.\nAgain, in this case this approach is sufficient when moving \u201cup\u201d scale levels, such\nthat the asymptotic limit of the smaller scale matches the equation at the higher\nscale.\n6.5. Critical analysis\nTo develop a workable multiscale modelling framework, a number of challenges must\nbe overcome. These include:\n\u2022 Analysing large interacting systems. One consequence of incorporating numerous\nsignalling pathways or interacting cytokines is a significant increase in system size\nand complexity. Mathematicians need to develop ways of analysing large interacting\nsystems without sacrificing the amount of information that can be gained. How\nmuch can one actually conclude from a huge system of equations with numerous\nvariables and parameters? What are the best ways to analyse these systems, and\nis the added complexity actually helping us learn anything? What methods are\nused to judge how good these models are at representing the system? Importantly,\nnone of the models previously mentioned truly model subcellular pathways from\ngenetic alterations to phenotypic changes. Although much of this is not yet known\nbiologically, techniques for accurately modelling these large interacting systems with\ncomputationally tractable models need to be developed.\n\u2022 Justification of coupling\/decoupling. It is still unclear when it is appropriate to\ndecouple systems which are intrinsically coupled. For example, the traditional form\nof Fickian diffusion decouples the chemistry from the mechanics of the system.\nFuture mathematicians need to develop methods to examine under what conditions\nit is suitable to decouple an otherwise coupled system.\n\u2022Mechanistic models. Current research has failed to provide truly mechanistic mod-\nels of angiogenesis and metastasis. In the case of angiogenesis, there is a lack of bio-\nlogically detailed modelling of branching, anastomosis, vascular normalisation and\nthe \u201cbrush border effect\u201d. Recent work by McDougall, Anderson and Chaplain138\nhas attempted to address this problem by making branching at capillary tips depen-\ndent on wall shear stress as well as chemical gradients. Also, theoreticians have com-\npletely ignored the processes of active cell migration to blood vessels, intravasation,\nextravasation, and distant site colonisation in metastatic spread.\n\u2022 Cell geometry. Few models account for changes in cell shape and deformation,\nwhich is known to affect cell-cyle regulation, growth, proliferation and movement.\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 633\n\u2022 Modelling transport properly. Future modellers will have to consider the appropri-\nate way to model diffusion in these systems (if, indeed, diffusion is the correct way to\nmodel transport). For example, what is the appropriate way to model complex non-\nlinear diffusion? Mathematicians dealing with porous media have utilised anomalous\n(or fractional) diffusion to describe diffusion through heterogeneous media (Met-\nzler and Klafter141). Future modellers should examine the various possible forms\nfor diffusion terms. How does diffusion depend on mechanics? How do stresses and\nstrains affect the diffusive process?\nModelling chemotaxis and haptotaxis properly. As with diffusion, alternate forms of\nchemotaxis and haptotaxis should be studied. For example, how can biphasic hap-\ntotaxis be properly modelled? Othmer and Stevens153 investigated various mathe-\nmatical forms for the chemotaxis term at the macroscopic (tissue) level, based on\nbehaviour at the individual cell level. They examined the relative importance of\nshort versus long range signalling, and if the manner of detection and transduction\nof the chemotactic signal affected cell movement. Further work such as this will\nhelp clarify our understanding of what types of mathematical terms should be used\nin different biological situations.\n\u2022 Modelling invasion as an active, coordinated process. Future models will need to\naddress the growing body of literature indicating that invasion is an active process\ninvolving various forms of cell motility and that metastasis to distant sites involves\ncoordination and signalling between different cell types (Friedl and Wolf,88 Kaplan\net al.123).\n\u2022 Calculation of error. Although there are well established techniques for deter-\nmining errors incurred in making simplifications at a single scale, there are few\ntechniques for integrated models which span several scales with complicated sig-\nnalling. It is still unclear in such complex systems how errors and noise grow and\nare propagated, an important future issue.\n7. Speculations Towards a Mathematical Theory\nWe have focused on modelling aspects at the various scales that characterise the\nsystem: molecular, cellular and tissue, as well as on the links between models at a\nspecific scale with those at the lower and higher scales.\nModelling at each scale is an essential passage to multiscale approaches. The\noverall system is viewed as a network of several interacting subsystems each\ndescribed by different models at different scales. Indeed, it is well understood that\na multiscale description is essential to capture the complexity of biological systems\nin general.\nThis final section is devoted to the ambitious aim of outlining the conceptual\npaths towards the development of a mathematical theory related to the complex\nsystem under consideration. The various concepts proposed in what follows are\nessentially based on two key papers taken from the biological sciences which aim\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n634 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nnot only to model very specific aspects, but also to put complex biological systems\ninto a general mathematical framework.\nThe relevant objective of the mathematical research is analogous to that of\nthe past two centuries when mathematics produced the formalisation of several\nphenomena in the science of physics. In other words, we aim to contribute to a\npreliminary reasoning on the genesis of a biological mathematical theory using\npaths followed, in the past, in the genesis of physical mathematical theories.\nIn detail we refer to the already cited papers by Hartwell et al.103 and Hana-\nhan and Weinberg.102 The first paper103 proposes the idea of a modular approach,\nwhere the whole system is decomposed into subsystems (modules), such that the\nidentification of each module is related to the expression of specific biological func-\ntions. The modular approach has been developed in various papers28,29,104; our\npaper aims to indicate how the approach can be developed at a practical level.\nThe second paper102 is focused on the analysis of the effect of genetic evolution-\nary mutations on the onset and progressive development of cancer towards stages\nwith increasing malignancy.\nThe following subsections are devoted to identifying how the above two papers\ncan contribute to the development of a mathematical biological theory and, in\naddition, how the analysis of mathematical problems, related to the application of\nmodels to the study of real biological phenomena, can take them into account.\n7.1. Perspective ideas for a mathematical biological theory\nHartwell\u2019s theory indicates that we first need to identify the relevant biological\nfunctions that are expressed during the evolution of the system. Consequently,\nmathematical methods can provide the decomposition of the overall system into\nmodules corresponding to the above functions.\nAccording to the analysis of the preceding sections, it is understood that:\n(i) The notion of function or purpose differentiates living systems in biology from\nthose of inert matter. Biological functions have the ability to modify the con-\nservation laws of classical mechanics and, in addition, can generate destructive\nand\/or proliferating events;\n(ii) The modular approach is applied to decompose complex biological systems into\nseveral modules that may, at least in some cases, be constituted by several ele-\nments which cooperatively express the above-mentioned biological functions;\n(iii) Each module is related to a well-defined scale, namely to models that are\ncharacterised by a different mathematical structure;\n(iv) Systems in biology cannot be simply observed and interpreted at a macroscopic\nlevel. A system constituted by millions of cells shows at the macroscopic level\nonly the output of cooperative and organised behaviours which may not, or\nare not, singularly observed.\nThe paper by Hanahan and Weinberg,102 in the context of item (i), reports how\nthe relevant biological functions are related to genetic mutations, where undesired\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 635\ncorruptions are often transferred into the expression of function. Section 4 critically\nanalysed various mathematical approaches to model the dynamics at the molecular\nscale with the attempt to understand how it affects dynamics and evolution at the\nhigher scales.\nAs we have seen, biological events at the higher scale of cells and tissues depend\non the dynamics at the molecular scale. Transferring the information from genes\nto cells is key to the derivation of a mathematical biological theory. This reasoning\ncan be made precise by referring to the cellular scale.\nThe mathematical structure reported in Sec. 3 can generate specific models if\nthe following parameters that, in general, depend on the microscopic states, are\nproperly identified:\nthe encounter rate \u03b7hk;\nthe transition probability density Bhk;\nthe population transition terms \u00b5ihk;\nthe proliferating\/destructive terms \u00b5hk.\nThe physics of classical particles, whose dynamics is ruled by particle inter-\naction models described by attractive\u2013repulsive potentials, gives a useful analogy.\nNewtonian mechanics provides the necessary mathematical background to describe\nparticle interactions by attraction\u2013repulsion potentials of the interacting particles,\nor by mechanical collisions which preserve mass, momentum and energy. A theoret-\nical description of the interaction potentials which govern pair interactions between\nparticles completes the theory. In the case of the system under consideration, biol-\nogy should contribute, by experiments and theoretical interpretations, to determine\nthe form the outcome of cellular interactions as described by the above-mentioned\ninteraction terms.\nThe mathematical models known in the literature have been obtained by assess-\ning the above-mentioned terms by a simple phenomenological interpretation of\nphysical reality and, in particular, of cellular interactions. A variety of models to\ndescribe immune competition with cancer cells has been reported in the book.35\nThese models have shown the ability to describe several interesting phenomena\nall related to the parameters of the model. These parameters have a well-defined\nbiological meaning.\nAs shown in Sec. 4, the structure of the equations used to describe tissue depends\non the predominance of one of the three aspects of the biological dynamics, i.e.\nencounter rate between cells, mutations and proliferating\/destructive events, with\nrespect to the other two. Moreover, the structure of the mathematical equations\nmodelling tissues may evolve in time due to the dynamics of genetic mutations.\nMoreover, more than one scale is necessary to represent the system. A typical\nexample is the modelling of angiogenesis.80,81,132 Various modelling approaches can\nbe found in the literature (see for example Refs. 174, 165, 166, 200 and 155).\nThese papers offer interesting descriptions of particular biological phenomena and\nindicate that rarely is one scale only sufficient to model even particular components\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\n636 N. Bellomo, N. K. Li & P. K. Maini\nof the system under consideration. A mathematical theory should identify for each\nsubsystem, regarded as a module, the correct mathematical structure suitable to\ngenerate models. Such a structure may evolve in time, which is one of the main\ndifficulties inherent in generating a mathematical biological theory.\n7.2. Mathematical problems\nThe application of models to the analysis of real biological phenomena generates\nnovel and challenging mathematical problems related to various issues, such as\nqualitative and computational analysis of the solutions, development of asymptotic\nmethods to reach the higher scales from the lower ones, and so on.\nThe variety of mathematical problems is broad and covers several issues related\nto qualitative and computational analysis of the solutions to problems. Let us con-\nsider, to avoid over-generalisation, papers limited to the following classification:\n(i) Free and moving boundary problems (that may also be related to thera-\npeutical applications). See, for example, Cui and Friedman,59 Friedman and\nLolas,85 Friedman,86 Bertuzzi, Fasano and Gandolfi,36,37 Tan and Guo,182 Tao\net al.183,184 A general formulation of the problem can be found in the paper by\nDe Angelis and Preziosi.63\n(ii) Qualitative analysis of initial value problems related to models at the cellular\nscale. See, for example, De Angelis and Jabin,61,62 Derbel,64 Bellouquid and\nDelitala,33,35 Micheler, Perthame and Ryzhik,144 and Michel.143\nThe above research fields do not cover the whole variety of mathematical prob-\nlems that have engaged applied mathematicians in this area. Indeed, a comprehen-\nsive review of all the problems in this area is beyond the scope of this paper. We\nhave chosen to focus on a few key topics in the hope that they are sufficient to\narouse the reader\u2019s interest. To summarise briefly:\n\u2014 The biological system under consideration modifies its structure in time due\nto genetic mutations. Therefore, the mathematical structure of the model may\nchange and should, at least in principle, be coupled with an evolution equation\nfor genetic mutations.\n\u2014 The system is made up of several interacting modules. Each module needs to be\nfully understood and suitably reduced before being integrated into the whole. A\nkey problem here is to understand how noise and error propagate through the\nintegrated whole.\nWhile we have stressed the need for inter-disciplinary collaboration, we should\nnot lose sight of the need for intra-disciplinary collaboration. For example, at a very\nabstract level, what we are really trying to do is to understand the spatio-temporal\npopulation dynamics of individuals with dynamically evolving internal states. This\nis very similar to the problems addressed by mathematical epidemiologists. An\nMarch 29, 2008 9:6 WSPC\/103-M3AS 00279\nSelected Topics on Cancer Modelling 637\nintriguing future direction may be to use insights from that area to inform modelling\napproaches in mathematical oncology.\nFuture research will definitely refine and improve the existing models, while the\nanalysis of the inherent mathematical problems will hopefully lead to new mathe-\nmatics, allowing us to tackle problems presently beyond our technical abilities.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partially supported by Marie Curie Network MRTN-CT-2004-\n503661 \u2014Modelling, Mathematical Methods and Computer Simulations of Tumour\nGrowth and Therapy.
