Uganda is invoked as a metaphor for a host of arguments and\ninsights about HIV\/AIDS. However, much of what has been asserted about\nthe country is not based on the available evidence. This paper reviews\nfindings by epidemiologists and anthropologists, and draws on the author\u2019s\nexperiences of researching in the country since the early 1980s. It comments\non various myths about HIV\/AIDS in Uganda, including myths about the\norigin and dissemination of the disease, about the links between HIV\/AIDS\nand war, and about declining rates of infection. It shows that much less is\nknown about Uganda than is commonly supposed, and it offers some\nalternative hypotheses for interpreting HIV prevalence and incidence data. In\nparticular it draws attention to the importance of mechanisms for social\ncompliance. It concludes by raising concerns about the current enthusiasm\nfor provision of anti-retroviral drugs.\nIntroduction\nWhen it comes to HIV\/AIDS, Uganda has mythical status. Its name appears in\nalmost every review of the pandemic in Africa, invoked as a kind of metaphor to\nsupport a wide range of contrasting arguments. The reasons for all the interest are\ntwo-fold. First, some of the very first cases of HIV\/AIDS were diagnosed in the\nsouth-west of the country in 1982\/3 and, since the latter part of that decade, assistance\nfrom international agencies has been actively encouraged by the government. There\nwas no denying of the links between HIV and AIDS (in fact some of the early work\nestablishing the link was carried out in Uganda), and the seriousness of the situation\nwas quickly recognized. For these reasons Uganda has been the site of a considerable\namount of externally funded research, one aspect of which has been to try to\nunderstand what might happen to the pandemic elsewhere. Second, from the\nmid-1990s it became apparent that in some Ugandan populations, rates of infection\nwere stable or declining. Subsequently, declines have been observed in overall trends\nand by the turn of the century, Uganda had become established as the one place in\nAfrica where high and rising HIV prevalence had been contained. From having a\nreputation as the worst affected place in the world, it has become a model for \u2018best\ncase\u2019 scenarios.\n7\nPartly because of this dramatic transformation in Uganda\u2019s status, remarkable\nassertions have been made about the efficacy of various public health strategies,\nprocedures of governance and mass behavioural change, as well as about the nature\nof the trends in infection themselves. Uganda, it seems, is like a cloud in which\ncommentators see whatever shapes they fancy. Journalists, politicians and aid agency\nstaff have become prone to exaggerate and dramatize, and this has clearly affected\nsome of the more academic analysis too. Working in the country as a social\nanthropologist for prolonged periods during the past twenty-five years, it has been\nhard not to be bemused by some well-established interpretations, and persistently\nsurprised by the ways in which evidence is ignored, set aside or under-emphasized.\nThis paper draws upon ethnographic knowledge acquired during this time (Allen,\n1988, 1989, 1991a, 1991b, 1992, 1994a, 1994b, 1994c, 1996, 1997, 2005; BBC\/Open\nUniversity, 1996, 2002), and reflects on some of the most commonly articulated\nperceptions of the Ugandan epidemic. It argues that many conventional perceptions\nare incorrect or partial, and that in certain instances there are alternative hypotheses\nthat might be fruitfully interrogated.\nThe evidence\nEvidence, of course, is a loaded concept. Attending a recent international conference\nin The Hague on what is known about the global HIV\/AIDS pandemic with respect\nto governance and security issues, it was striking how the experts and policy-makers\ncontrasted two kinds of information \u2013 \u2018data\u2019 and \u2018anecdote\u2019. The former essentially\nreferred to quantified information, including rates of HIV incidence and prevalence,\nnumbers of people raped or numbers of condoms distributed. The latter term was\nused for qualitative information about a particular place, such as researchers\u2019\naccounts of the kinds of things rape victims say in South Africa or what happens to\nmen who have sex with men in Thailand. A problem at this meeting, and also more\nwidely, is that \u2018data\u2019 are given much greater emphasis, and \u2018anecdotes\u2019 tend to be set\naside as perhaps interesting, but largely irrelevant when it comes to policy. A fetish\nfor numbers is not unusual, but seems to be extreme with respect to HIV\/AIDS. It\nis surely counter-productive. If declining HIV incidence is linked to behavioural\nchanges in the most intimate aspects of social relations, then changes are required in\nunderstandings and expectations of accountability and duty \u2013 in other words, in what\nit means to act in a moral way. This is something that cannot be readily numerated,\nand even if trends in a population become apparent over time, detailed localized\ninformation is the most likely way to find out why they have occurred. The\njuxtaposition of \u2018data\u2019 and \u2018anecdote\u2019 also masks a great deal. \u2018Data\u2019 may be based\non careful, longitudinal epidemiological population studies, or they may be no more\nthan a guess, elaborated from the most flimsy information. Meanwhile, so-called\n\u2018anecdotes\u2019 may be the product of in-depth ethnographic field research, or may be no\nmore than something said by an aid worker in a bar to a journalist. Usually it is not\ndifficult to look more carefully at where evidence comes from, but perhaps it is naive\nto propose that this would be a good idea \u2013 too often the purpose of presenting both\n\u2018data\u2019 and \u2018anecdotes\u2019 about AIDS is merely to illustrate entrenched assumptions. In\nUganda the problem is acute.\n8 T. Allen\nLike other African countries, the national prevalence rates for Uganda are mainly\nderived from antenatal surveillance. Anonymous testing is carried out at selected\nclinics on blood drawn from first-time visits during a given pregnancy of women\nattending antenatal clinic. There are several well known problems with this method.\nThese include the following: first, HIV-positive women are less likely to become\npregnant than women who are HIV-negative; second, in African countries surveillance\nsites tend to be based in urban and peri-urban locations where rates are usually higher\nthan in rural areas; third, data are not usually available with which to adjust\nantenatal surveillance for AIDS-related mortality; fourth, the method may lead to an\nover-representation of younger mothers and may not accurately reflect the prevalence\nrate in the \u2018sexually active population\u2019, and fifth, antenatal prevalence data may not\nbe closely linked with rates of incidence (i.e. rates of new infection). It might be added\nthat if anti-retroviral treatment becomes effective at reducing mortality, a rise in HIV\nprevalence should be assessed as a positive outcome.\nAnother problem that is commonly overlooked is that patterns of antenatal\nsurveillance coverage vary hugely from country to country and region to region. In\nBotswana, for example, rural areas are relatively well resourced with clinics.\nAccording to the Botswana Family Health Survey of 1988, over 90% of women\nconsulted a trained health worker during the course of pregnancy, and almost 80%\ndelivered under the supervision of a doctor or bio-medically trained midwife\n(Government of Botswana, 1989). In Uganda, formal health facilities in many places\nare minimal. Over 80% of the population live in rural areas, 63% more than 5 km\nfrom a public or NGO clinic. Just 25% of deliveries actually take place in a health\nfacility, and 60% of clinics have less than the assessed minimum staffing levels\n(Ministry of Health, 2005a; see Appendix note at end). In addition, fifteen of the 21\nsentinel sites are in the south of the country. The six northern sites only began\noperating in 1993 and are clustered in the north-west. Only one site, at Matany in\nMoroto District, covers the entire north-east.\nA bias towards southern Uganda is also a limitation with the most robust data\navailable on the country. Longitudinal, epidemiological, population surveys are the\nonly reliable method of measuring the level of HIV infection within age cohorts and\namong men and women, making it possible to assess changes in rates of incidence.\nHowever, they require political stability and governmental support, and are expensive\nand time consuming. Very few studies of this kind have proved possible in Africa,\neven in high-prevalence countries such as Botswana. Of the three most important, two\nhave taken place in the neighbouring districts of Masaka and Rakai in south-west\nUganda (Rakai District is located just to the south of Masaka). Both these studies\nhave tracked populations from the end of the 1980s in the part of Uganda in which\nHIV\/AIDS has probably been endemic for the longest. The first diagnosed Ugandan\nAIDS cases were from Kasensero in Rakai, and for some time an unspecified local\ndisease known as \u2018slim\u2019 had been linked to excess mortality. The two studies are run\nindependently, and began to publish findings in 1995. The Masaka study monitored\n10,000 people living in a cluster of fifteen villages. Results from the first five-year\nfollow-up showed little change in overall seroprevalence (from 8\u00b72% in 1990 to 7\u00b76%\nin 1994). However, there was a highly significant drop noted among males aged\n13\u201324 years (from 3\u00b74% to 1\u00b70%), and a less dramatic drop among females of the same\nAIDS and evidence: some Ugandan myths 9\nage cohort (from 9\u00b79% to 7\u00b73%). This was the first report of a decline in HIV-1\nprevalence among young adults in a general population in sub-Saharan Africa with\nhigh overall HIV-1 prevalence (Mulder et al., 1995). Soon afterwards, similar declines\nwere also noted from the more heavily infected population tracked in Rakai, and\nsubsequent results indicated that downward trends at both sites were being sustained\n(e.g. Mbulaiteye et al., 2002).\nAlthough there had been some indications that HIV prevalence rates might be\ndeclining in certain parts of Uganda from 1993, it was the findings from the\nsouth-west in 1995 that transformed the country, almost overnight, from an\nHIV\/AIDS disaster into an apparent success story. Sceptics might have pointed out\nthat generalizing from the observed declines in the mainly rural south-west might not\nbe appropriate. But such voices were largely ignored, and the trends in antenatal\nsurveillance prevalence data from almost all sentinel surveillance sites during the\nremainder of the 1990s reinforced and sustained optimistic interpretations. The rates\nof declining prevalence at sentinel sites have varied substantially, with the steepest\ndecline being recorded at some urban sites (Ministry of Health, 2003). At Mbarara,\nreported prevalence peaked at 30\u00b72% in 1992 (the highest rate recorded anywhere in\nUganda), declining to 10% in 2000 and then rising slightly to 10\u00b78% in 2002. Median\nantenatal surveillance data from all sites in 1993 gave a national rate of just under\n12%. This had declined to around 5% in 2000, and has subsequently risen to about\n6%.\nA further source of data relating to national rates of infection has also become\navailable at the time of writing. In 2004\/5 a \u2018sero-behavioural survey\u2019 was carried out\nunder the auspices of the Ugandan Ministry of Health. A total of 18,000 women and\nmen aged 15\u201359 were tested for HIV and interviewed about their knowledge, attitudes\nand practices. Only preliminary results have so far been made public (Ministry of\nHealth, 2005b). According to this survey 7\u00b79% of adult women are HIV-positive and\n6% of men. People living in urban areas had an infection rate of 10\u00b77% compared\nwith 6\u00b74% in rural areas. This is not the first seroprevalence study based on testing\na random sample of the population. A survey in 1992 found a rate of 18%. However,\nthe earlier surveys are not directly comparable, because coverage of areas outside of\nthe south was very limited. An advantage of the new study is that it has attempted\nto sample populations from the whole country. The highest rates have been found in\nKampala (9\u00b72%), followed by what is termed the \u2018central region\u2019 \u2013 including Masaka\nand Rakai (9\u00b71%), and the \u2018central north\u2019 (9\u00b71%) \u2013 including Gulu municipality, from\nwhere the \u2018regional\u2019 population sample appears to have been taken (according to a\npersonal communication with a locally based WHO staff member).\nIn addition to the population studies, the antenatal sentinel surveillance, and the\nrecent national survey, there is a great deal of other information on HIV\/AIDS in\nUganda based upon studies of particular groups. It is of very variable quality. Much\nof it is based on so-called \u2018anecdotal\u2019 or \u2018qualitative\u2019 evidence, including anthropo-\nlogical fieldwork (for useful reviews of this literature, see Bond & Vincent, 1997;\nLyons, 2004). Anthropological research in Uganda has mostly been linked either to\nclinical and epidemiological programmes or to projects supporting community\nresilience and participatory development. It has been particularly useful in highlight-\ning the lived experience of the disease, and in investigation of changes in social\n10 T. Allen\nrelations. One study from the end of the 1980s, for example, noted that at Kitovu\nhospital in Masaka, two adults were required to look after each patient with AIDS,\nwith probably a third delivering food (Bond & Vincent, 1997, p. 91). However, a\nproblem with the applied anthropological studies of Uganda is that they have tended\nto be constrained by the need for quick results, have been unable to study sexual\npractices in sufficient detail (partly because it is not something that lends itself to\nparticipant observation methodology), and have also been limited to those places in\nthe south of the country of primary concern to donors and biomedical investigators.\nThere have also been several broader anthropological studies that have located the\nepidemic within the context of discussion and analysis of the livelihoods and social\nrelations of particular groups (e.g. Wallman, 1996; Whyte, 1997), or have offered a\ncritical commentary on established ways of thinking (e.g. Susser et al., 1997; Whyte\net al., 2002; Allen & Heald, 2004). These have been less geographically restricted, but\nfew in number, partly reflecting a general withdrawal of the discipline from engaging\ndirectly with HIV\/AIDS in response to demands for targeted investigation with\npreordained conclusions (Heald, 2003).\nSo, from the various sources of information available, what can be claimed with\nconfidence about the epidemic in Uganda? Qualitative evidence has described how\nAIDS-related morbidity and mortality have affected people, especially in the south\nand south-west. There has been relatively little of the kind of denial observed in\nsouthern Africa \u2013 although stigma remains an issue. For almost two decades there has\nbeen widespread awareness that HIV\/AIDS is a serious problem. Ethnographic and\nother accounts continue to highlight the appalling consequences of the disease and\nsuggest that its full impact has not yet been experienced, because of its unique\nepidemic curves (Barnett & Whiteside, 2002). Evidence that things are improving in\nterms of declining HIV incidence and prevalence is based on results from the\npopulation studies in Masaka and Rakai, and the data from mainly urban and\nperi-urban antenatal clinics, mostly located in the south. The extent to which these\ndata reflect overall national rates of infection is open to question. Very little is known\nabout HIV\/AIDS rates in the north of the country. Nevertheless, it is clear that\nprevalence rates have not exploded since the early 1990s in the way that they have in\nsouthern Africa.\nAlthough it remains disappointingly partial, evidence about the Ugandan epidemic\nhas accumulated over time. However, this has not had such a direct bearing on\nanalysis and policy as might be supposed. Anthropologists have often felt that their\ninsights are ignored. But the findings of epidemiological studies too are taken out of\ncontext, set aside, or used selectively to support preconceived notions. Interpretations\nof HIV\/AIDS in Uganda have taken on lives of their own, in which evidence of all\nkinds plays a secondary role.\nMyths of origin and dissemination\nUntil the mid-1990s, Uganda was widely thought to have the highest HIV\/AIDS rates\nin the world. There were no comparative data with which to support this view, but\nstories about a disease locally called \u2018slim\u2019 having killed people for a long time, the\nAIDS and evidence: some Ugandan myths 11\nearly diagnosis of AIDS cases, and the willingness of President Museveni\u2019s govern-\nment to allow investigation and public discussion about the disease, all contributed to\nthe idea that things must be much worse here than elsewhere. It also led to\nassumptions that HIV\/AIDS had originated in south-west Uganda, or somewhere\nnearby, and played a part in fostering assertions about a \u2018black plague\u2019 with distinctly\nracist connotations (Chirimuuta & Chirimuuta, 1989). A host of speculative theories\nabout how the disease emerged dominated the early debates, and have remained\ncontroversial (a good review can be found at http:\/\/www.avert.org\/origins.htm). It is\nnow generally accepted that HIV-1, the form of HIV found in Uganda, originated\nfrom a strain of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) that has been observed in\ncertain chimpanzees from west-central Africa. Exactly how the virus mutated and\njumped species is unknown, and probably always will be, although hypotheses are still\nbeing presented with apparent confidence. The most widely publicized explanation has\nlinked the origins of the HIV-1 epidemic with the testing of an oral polio vaccine\ngiven to about a million people in the Belgian Congo, Rwanda and Burundi in the\nlate 1950s (Hooper, 1999). There has been a great deal of argument about whether\nor not this could have been possible, and some analysts, including Hooper himself,\nremain unconvinced by the various rebuttals (see, for example, Hooper\u2019s own website\nat http:\/\/www.aidsorigins.com). Even if he is correct, it can only be a partial\nexplanation, as it relates to only one HIV sub-type (group M), but his work has fed\nconspiracy theories about unscrupulous governments and medics.\nLeaving aside myths of origin, what about myths of dissemination? In the 1980s\nmost knowledge about the spread of HIV\/AIDS was associated with \u2018core\u2019 and \u2018risk\u2019\ngroups in rich countries. In Uganda the focus was truck drivers and sex workers\n(coyly referred to as \u2018barmaids\u2019). Early seroprevalence surveys in Rakai District found\na sample of lorry drivers to be 33% positive and \u2018barmaids\u2019 to be 67% positive\n(Carswell et al., 1989). These results were then assumed to be widely representative.\nFor example, an Economist Intelligence Unit Country Report of 1990 quoted these\nfigures as if they were rates for these high-risk groups for Uganda as a whole (Bond\n& Vincent, 1997, p. 90). In fact, data on rates among drivers and sex workers in other\nparts of the country have remained sparse. It is also far from clear that rates among\nhigh-risk groups are a bridge of infection to the population as a whole, because they\nmay be socially contained or ostracized. Other studies have pointed to \u2018high-risk\nbehaviours\u2019 or \u2018high-risk populations\u2019 in some border areas associated with intense\ntrading activities and in urban centres (Lyons, 2004). Antenatal prevalence data\nindicate that this broader approach to risk is probably more insightful.\nAnother limitation with the risk group literature on Uganda is that, unlike\ncomparable work on richer countries, non-sexual transmission of HIV\/AIDS is\nunder-emphasized or largely discounted. This relates to the most prevalent assertion\nof all about HIV\/AIDS in Uganda \u2013 that infection is a consequence of heterosexual\nsexual intercourse. No sensible person denies that sexual intercourse is a major cause\nof infection. But what is the evidence that it has been as important as is generally\nassumed? In recent years, mother-to-child transmission has been given greater\nprominence, at least in part because there appear to be relatively cheap ways of\nlimiting it. Nevertheless, transmission of HIV in Uganda and Africa as a whole is\nwidely believed to be due overwhelmingly to unsafe, \u2018conventional\u2019 sexual contact. Is\n12 T. Allen\nthis a myth? Perhaps not, but it is certainly an idea that has accrued mythical\nelements.\nThe point has been put forcefully by a series of articles that appeared in the\nInternational Journal of STD and AIDS in 2003. In one of these papers, Gisselquist\net al. (2003) examined data from studies of risk factors of HIV in Africa and\nproposed that the proportion from sexual transmission could be estimated. It is\nconcluded that although data are frustratingly limited, they indicate that sexual\ntransmission explains about 30% of HIV incidence. Among the epidemiological\nevidence that they investigated was the population study in Rakai, south-west\nUganda. Here they noted that there was information about transmission between\nserodiscordant partners, and that it was less than a third of what would be necessary\nto sustain the epidemic. In a companion paper, bold statements were made about\n\u2018mounting anomalies\u2019 in the epidemiology of HIV, which might be explained with\nreference to other modes of transmission, notably poor medical hygiene such as the\nuse of contaminated needles (Brewer et al., 2003).\nNot surprisingly, the response from international health agencies and many senior\nepidemiologists has been critical. A meeting was held at the WHO in Geneva to\ndiscuss the findings, focusing in particular on the argument about unsafe injections.\nReportedly, the prevailing view amongst experts at the meeting was that the re-use of\nneedles or syringes in the absence of sterilization is not sufficiently common to play\na dominant role in HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, and that sexual\ntransmission was responsible for the majority of cases (WHO, 2003; Schmid et al.,\n2004). However, the arguments of Gisselquist and his colleagues have not been\nrebutted in detail, and many of the issues they raised are surely worthy of further\ninvestigation. Anthropologists working in Uganda, for example, have repeatedly\ndrawn attention to local healing and ritual practices involving cutting and incisions,\nas well as the very widespread re-use of needles and syringes (Allen, 1991b, 1992;\nWhyte, 1997). Systematic studies on needles and syringes were carried out in two\nareas of Uganda in 1992\/93. At the research site in the east it was found that 63%\nof households possessed needles and syringes and that 21% had vials of injectable\nmedicine at hand. In 25% of households at least one person had received an injection\nin the past two weeks, and 17% of injections were administered at home. The figures\nfrom the site in the west were even higher: 83% had equipment and 34% had vials of\ninjectable medicine at home (reported in Whyte et al., 2002, p. 108). The majority of\nhome-administered injections in Uganda are intramuscular (chloroquine and penicil-\nlin), so the chance of HIV infection is low in any particular instance, but the scale\nof needle re-use must represent an accumulated risk. Moreover, I have found that\nmore than one family member is sometimes injected with the same needle consecu-\ntively. At the very least it is reasonable to conclude that this problem is under-\nreported and under-emphasized. Similar points might be made about blood\ntransfusions. These are now supposed to be screened, but from personal observations\nwere manifestly unsafe during the 1980s.\nWhatever the merits of the argument about transmission of HIV by unsafe\nmedical practices, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the almost exclusive emphasis\non sexual transmission has been more than simply a response to the available\nevidence. It is also odd, given the emphasis, how little information about sexual\nAIDS and evidence: some Ugandan myths 13\npractices has actually been collected. In Uganda virtually nothing is known about\nanal sex or homosexual sex. Both are basically taboo subjects in the country itself,\nand it is almost as if international researchers have not wanted to ask \u2018indecent\u2019\nquestions. Information about heterosexual vaginal intercourse too seems to be mainly\nbased on assumptions. There have been reports about dry sex and violent sex, but no\ncareful analysis of how and why sexual practices change, and how and why they differ\nbetween partners and from area to area. Significantly, orgasm is a word that does not\nappear in the academic literature on Uganda \u2013 in marked contrast with Red Pepper\nand other Kampala-based newspapers, in which just about all aspects of the sex act\nare something of an obsession.\nOn the one hand, it seems that academic research on the sex act in Uganda, as\nin Africa more widely, is constrained by a perceived need to be both sensitive and\ncircumspect. On the other hand much of what has been claimed is based on little\nmore than speculation, and is sometimes affected by very misleading assumptions\nabout a homogeneous African sexuality. One particularly influential model has been\nthe work of the demographer J. Caldwell and his associates. Ethnographic accounts\nfrom all over Africa, including Uganda, are mined for anecdotes about local customs\nof marriage, kinship and fertility to show that the core of African society is its\nemphasis on ancestry and descent (Caldwell et al., 1989; Caldwell & Caldwell, 1990).\nThis, it is argued, means that reproduction for the lineage will normally be privileged\nover safe sex. Some aspects of Caldwell\u2019s work are thought provoking, but the fall-out\nhas been that the very thing that gives good ethnographic research its power, namely\nits engagement with the complexities of the local, are subsumed into generalizations.\nAs Suzette Heald has observed, this has had pernicious consequences. It involves\ndisregard for the particularity of moral norms and encourages a new pathologizing of\nAfrica (Heald, 2003, p. 217). Amongst other things, it has deflected attention away\nfrom the dismal failures of public health programmes towards lazy and misinformed\nideas about \u2018traditional culture\u2019 acting as a barrier to behavioural change.\nMyths about war and HIV\/AIDS\nAnother hypothesis put forward in the early years of the epidemic was that\nHIV\/AIDS spread in Uganda as a result of war. It is an idea that has taken on a new\nsignificance since the turn of the century, and requires close scrutiny here.\nFollowing the Tanzanian invasion of 1979 there were civil wars in various parts\nof Uganda, with fighting initially concentrated in the south-west and in the Luwero\nregion immediately to the north of Kampala. Rape by soldiers and forced population\ndisplacements were common. Following the capture of power by Museveni\u2019s National\nResistance Army, the areas of fighting shifted to Gulu and Kitgum in the north,\nwhere it is still occurring. In the late 1980s there was a perception in southern Uganda\nthat AIDS was partly a legacy of the upheavals inflicted upon the people by\nnortherners and Tanzanians. A paper published in 1991 by Smallman-Raynor and\nCliff looked at the available evidence for this thesis and compared it with two other\nestablished hypotheses: that AIDS had been spread by truck drivers passing through\ntowns or by labour migrants. At the time there were no longitudinal HIV prevalence\nrates. The authors used Ugandan Ministry of Health data up to the end of 1989 on\n14 T. Allen\nthe 12,444 diagnosed AIDS cases, and related these to reported places of residence.\nFrom this an \u2018incidence rate\u2019 was calculated by using the 1980 census. This rate was\nthen analysed with reference to recruitment rates into the Uganda National\nLiberation Army (UNLA), based on reported \u2018tribal\u2019 composition of the army in\nNovember 1979. Smallman-Raynor and Cliff took pains to emphasize that the\nevidence from which they were working was at best sketchy, but tentatively concluded\nthat military-associated factors were more significant than the other explanations\n(Smallman-Raynor & Cliff, 1991).\nThere are obvious problems with the case presented. All the data sets used were\nhighly problematic (for example the mechanisms for diagnosing AIDS patients varied\nwidely across the country). It is also debatable that the numerical proxies used were\nadequate. Even if it is accepted that ethnic patterns of recruitment in the UNLA\ncould be a proxy for the effects of military activity, as the authors themselves note,\nthe ethnic composition of the UNLA altered radically in the course of the early 1980s.\nMoreover, the rates of infection in the general population of Rakai must have been\nhigh well before the Tanzanian invasion passed through the area in order to explain\nthe excess mortality associated with \u2018slim\u2019 in the early 1980s. The argument in the\npaper that civil war spread the disease from the south-west to the rest of the country\nis driven by the rates of reported AIDS cases in Kampala and Gulu. But these rates\nmight be explained by non-military movements of populations both before and after\nthe Tanzanian invasion. The high Gulu rate might have been due to non-military\nmovements of people under Obote and Okello, and by the movement of non-\ncombatants following the fall of the Okello government. It might additionally reflect\nthe fact that there had been many Acholi soldiers in the UNLA, and they might have\nplayed a significant role in spreading the disease in their home district. But whether\nthey actually did so is unknown. There is some evidence that they were ostracized\n(Allen, 1991a). Also, if war was the main cause of the disease spreading, it seems\nstrange that the reported rates in Luwero and West Nile (Arua and Moyo Districts)\nwere relatively low. This is where fighting was most intense during the early to\nmid-1980s. In sum, there are no data in the paper to indicate that the collective\nactions of soldiers themselves drove the epidemic, which is not to say it was not\nimportant, just that there was no evidence to draw upon. The data used to assess the\nalternative explanatory models were similarly flawed, so not much weight can be given\nto the conclusions. Essentially the paper was a pioneering piece, which aimed at\nopening up the HIV\/AIDS risks from war for further investigation. However, much\nmore than this has been read into it.\nIn recent years there has been growing international concern and interest in the\nconnections between AIDS, security and armed conflict. This has been largely a\nresponse to perceived threats in rich countries and to the revelations about HIV rates\namong UN peace-keeping forces, but there has also been an acceptance that in some\nparts of the world, notably in Africa, war may be driving the pandemic (see, for\nexample, UNICEF, 1996). One indication of this was UN Security Council\nResolution 1308 of July 2000 which officially recognizes \u2018that the HIV\/AIDS\npandemic is . . . exacerbated by conditions of violence and instability\u2019. Unfortunately,\ngood evidence remains sparse. In this context, the paper by Smallman-Raynor and\nCliff has taken on a significance that the authors could not have anticipated. A\nAIDS and evidence: some Ugandan myths 15\nstriking example can be found in the widely cited flagship World Bank report called\nBreaking the Conflict Trap. Citing the article by Smallman-Raynor and Cliff, the\nauthors suggest that a far reaching claim might be made: \u2018the origin of the global\npandemic is a consequence of a particular civil war\u2019.\nThe hypothesis, for which credible evidence exists, but which is far from proven, is that the\nconditions of war enabled what would otherwise have been a routine, localized outbreak to spiral\nout of control. Even if we attach only a small likelihood to this explanation being correct \u2013 say\n10% \u2013 then one-tenth of the global cost of the AIDS pandemic should be added to the estimated\nglobal cost of civil war . . . Epidemiological research on the spread of HIV\/AIDS points out that\nthe initial spread of HIV is closely associated with the war in Uganda in 1979 ... The spread of\nAIDS from the south to the north of Uganda exhibited the same route as the one Idi Amin\u2019s\nsoldiers followed. . . .\u2019 (Collier et al., 2003, pp. 41, 47)\nLeaving aside the confusion between Amin\u2019s soldiers and the soldiers of the\ninvading UNLA \u2013 to which Smallman-Raynor & Cliff\u2019s data refer \u2013 this is a quite\nastonishing interpretation of their paper, a kind of updating of the origins myths\ndiscussed above. But the World Bank report is not the only recent publication to\nstress the significance of war for HIV\/AIDS and to highlight the significance of the\nTanzanian invasion of Uganda. The influential anthropologist and human rights\nactivist Alex de Waal refers to the invasion in a piece graphically entitled \u2018Fucking\nSoldiers\u2019. He argues that: \u2018The risk-embracing nature of military life makes a mockery\nof safe sex messages . . .\u2019, and that \u2018A big part of the blame for Africa\u2019s AIDS\nepidemic must fall on wars, soldiers and cultures of militarisation\u2019 (de Waal, 2002).\nDe Waal recognizes that the evidence base is weak \u2013 no more than a \u2018compilation of\nanecdotes and snatches of data\u2019. Nevertheless, the arguments he presents carry weight,\nnot least because they appear to be \u2018common sense\u2019. They are echoed in many aid\nagency and media accounts, and have now become so common in reports on\nHIV\/AIDS in Ugandan war zones that observers and activists have accepted the links\nbetween militarization and high infection rates as an established fact. Thus, the\ncurrent HIV\/AIDS situation in the north is contrasted with the apparent achievement\nin containing the epidemic in the south.\nIn 2004, for example, World Vision, an agency that has been working in the war\nzone for many years, claimed that Uganda\u2019s\n. . . protracted civil war threatens to unravel the country\u2019s dramatic improvements as AIDS rates\nskyrocket in the country\u2019s northern region . . . [T]he 18-year war between the Ugandan\ngovernment and the rebel Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA) . . . has increased the HIV rates in parts\nof the north to 11\u00b79% \u2013 nearly double the rest of the country . . . Many women, especially those\nin the displacement camps, find that they can only get food, soap or money in exchange for sex.\nGirls who are abducted by the LRA are often given to commanders as \u2018wives\u2019 and sex slaves.\nThose who \u2018night commute\u2019 and sleep in the cities to avoid abduction are often raped there.\n(World Vision, 2004a, b)\nWorld Vision\u2019s analysis was immediately seized upon by the main international\nmedia organizations, and repeated as an objective assessment of the situation, based\non in-depth local level knowledge. For example, the BBC reported that \u2018doctors say\u2019\nthat, \u2018About half the girls who escape from the rebels are found to be HIV positive,\u2019\n(BBC, 2004; see also Reuters, 2004a, b; IRIN-UNOCHA, 2004). Somewhat similar\npoints have also appeared in many other reports and articles (e.g. Dolan & Bagenda,\n16 T. Allen\n2004) and, during fieldwork in 2005, I found that assumptions about HIV\/AIDS\nescalating out of control were being taken for granted among most aid workers and\ngovernment officials working in the war-affected region.\nThere is no doubt that the situation in northern Uganda is appalling, and has been\nfor a long time. There have been dreadful abuses and disease-related mortality has\nbeen reported to be very high (MSF, 2004; Allen, 2005; WHO, 2005). However, is\nthere really evidence that the war is pushing up HIV incidence rates? The\nstraightforward answer is that no incidence rates have been recorded in northern\nUganda, but antenatal prevalence rates suggest that incidence might be going down,\nnot up. World Vision makes the point that the war has increased the HIV rates in\nparts of the north to 11\u00b79%, which is nearly double that in the rest of the country.\nIt is a point that local informants reiterate and has appeared in numerous newspaper\narticles. It is presumably based on the antenatal sentinel surveillance at Lacor hospital\nnear Gulu, which recorded a rate of 11\u00b79% in 2002. This was indeed the highest rate\nat any surveillance site in the country for that year. The rate was more than double\nthe national average, but it is misleading to interpret this as being double the rate in\nthe rest of the country. Several other sites also had high rates. At Mbarara in the\nsouth-west it was 10\u00b78%. Also the rates at Lacor have not been on an upward\ntrajectory. Since it became an official surveillance site in 1992, rates have declined\nfrom 27\u00b71% (Accorsi et al., 2001, 2005; Fabiani et al., 2003). Indeed, the decline in\nantenatal prevalence recorded at Lacor is one of the steepest recorded anywhere in the\ncountry (Ministry of Health, 2003, p. 10).\nAs has been noted above, there are problems with reading too much into antenatal\ndata. They are not a good indicator of overall adult prevalence. Nevertheless, the\ntrend at Lacor is dramatic. There are, moreover, other data available at Lacor that\nare equally positive. The hospital has run tests on a sample of all in-patients referred\nto the hospital. Most of these people are already very seriously ill. The rate of those\nwith HIV has declined from 74\u00b72% in 1994 to 44% in 2002. In addition, in some years\nall TB and cancer cases have been tested. Among cancer cases, HIV rates declined\nfrom 21\u00b72% in 1997 to 13\u00b72% in 1999. Among TB cases, HIV rates fell from 57\u00b77%\nin 1994 to 44\u00b76% in 1999. They have risen steeply to 69% in 2002, but this is explained\nby the fact that the hospital changed its admission procedures to only accept terminal\ncases as in-patients.\nFrom the Lacor data it seems likely that incidence rates were higher in the past\nthan they have become since the mid-1990s, indicating that the upheavals of the\n1980s, including the migrations from the south of Uganda following the overthrow of\nOkello in 1986, may indeed have been a factor. The war in the area from 1986 up\nuntil the early 1990s may also have contributed, although it is unclear how much. The\ndeclines in reported prevalence at Lacor since the mid-1990s may be partly explained\nby high AIDS-related mortality, but the evidence of that is unclear. Malaria and\ninfectious diseases of childhood are reported to be the primary disease burden by staff\nat Lacor hospital (Accorsi et al., 2005). In the general population, AIDS-related\nmortality is likely to be high among adults, but there seems to be no evidence that\nit is higher than in other parts of the country.\nLacor hospital, it should be mentioned, is located near the largest urban centre in\nnorthern Uganda. If patterns observed in antenatal rates in other parts of Uganda are\nAIDS and evidence: some Ugandan myths 17\nanything to go by, it might be anticipated that antenatal rates would be much higher\nthan in more rural locations. There is some evidence for this from antenatal\nsurveillance that has been carried out by an Italian NGO between 2002 and 2004 at\nthe two main hospitals in Kitgum town, a much smaller place than Gulu, and at\nKalongo in Pader District, which services largely rural areas. Prevalence rates vary\nfrom 4\u00b76% to 9\u00b79%, with the lower rates being recorded at Kalongo. These rates are\nbased on surveillance of 14,570 women who chose to participate in a \u2018prevention of\nmother to child transmission\u2019 programme. So it is likely that these rates too are\nsignificantly higher then the rate in the adult population as a whole. Interestingly,\nthey suggest a similar pattern to that recorded by a comparable programme in\npeaceful locations in central Uganda \u2013 at Hoima town a rate of 8\u00b71% was recorded\nwhile in rural Kigorobya the rate was found to be 4\u00b73% (Ciantia, 2004).\nDrawing on fieldwork in 2004\/5, an alternative hypothesis seems appropriate\nabout the war in northern Uganda. From the mid-1990s most people living in the war\nzone have been compelled to reside in IDP camps. These camps are controlled by the\nUgandan army and administered through a system of camp commanders and the\ndirectly elected local councils. Movement in and out of the camps is restricted, and\nthere are curfews from soon after dusk. It is hard to move far from the camps during\nthe day, even for purposes of cultivation, because there is a threat of attack from the\nLRA or the local soldiers may suspect collaboration. Sanitation and housing is very\npoor, with thousands of people being confined in small areas. There is very little\nprivacy, and social interaction is quite tightly regulated, making sexual activities\nalmost impossible to hide. There is also a considerable amount of AIDS awareness.\nSoldiers interviewed are amongst the few people who openly use condoms. Women\nwho spend time at the barracks are well known and are generally considered to be\nthe soldiers\u2019 wives. Around 80% of the population are now living in these camps, and\nin Gulu, Kitgum and Pader Districts people have been living in them for the best part\nof a decade. There are also striking differences between Gulu town today and the\nsituation in the late 1980s. In the late 80s, for example, it was common for bars and\nlodges to be frequented by sex workers. This is no longer allowed to occur. While not\ndisputing that there are cases of rape and transactional sex, there does not seem to\nbe evidence that it is as systematic or as widespread as some accounts have indicated.\nRather, social control mechanisms have been imposed, partly for security or military\nreasons, and partly also because of HIV\/AIDS awareness. This has made the spread\nof the virus by such behaviours less likely.\nIt should also be mentioned that both the UPDF (the Ugandan army) and the\nLRA have rules about their own sexual activities. The UPDF have been encouraged\nto use condoms and rape is, in theory, a punishable offence. It does happen, but many\nof the soldiers working in the war zone are locally recruited and they are stationed\nat the same locations for several months. They become integrated into local networks\nof accountability. Also, contrary to some reports, the LRA has not raped indiscrimi-\nnately. Abducted girls are given to combatants and senior commanders as a reward.\nThe girls become these men\u2019s \u2018wives\u2019 and are expected to produce children. Other men\nare not supposed to touch them. A few women reported that they had not been raped\nor \u2018married\u2019 during their period of abduction, but had been used as servants because\nthey were suspected of having AIDS. Given the statements made by World Vision\n18 T. Allen\nand reported by the BBC, staff at the agency\u2019s reception centre in Gulu town were\ninterviewed about HIV and AIDS cases. The clinic at the centre had no means of\ntesting for HIV, and had no data on those returning from abduction being\nHIV-positive. However, some of the other reception centres have arranged HIV tests\nat one or other of the hospitals. The results are kept confidential, and have not\nusually been collated to give a rate of infection for this specific group. An exception\nis the Rachele centre in Lira town, where almost everyone who might have been\nexposed to infection is counselled and tested. The rate of those found to be\nHIV-positive is less than 1%.\nThere is no doubt that atrocious sexual abuses have occurred, but there does not\nseem to be evidence that military activities and rape are driving the HIV\/AIDS\nepidemic. On the contrary, at least in recent years, militarization and the imposition\nof social controls may have been a factor in rates declining. War might be a reason\nfor rising rates, but it is just as likely to be a reason for rates falling. As several\nauthors have recently pointed out from evidence elsewhere in Africa, it depends on\nlocal circumstances (e.g. Speigel, 2004). Finally, evidence from northern Uganda\nindicates that the highest HIV rates are at urban centres. This suggests that when the\nmass of the population is finally released from the IDP camps they may become\nvulnerable to HIV infection if they head for the towns in search of work.\nMyths about declining rates\nSince the mid-1990s myths about the origin and spread of HIV\/AIDS in Uganda have\nbeen joined by myths about their decline. One of the most common is that HIV\/AIDS\nrates in the country have fallen from 30% to less than 6% in a decade. It is a claim\nthat continues to be made \u2013 the US global AIDS co-ordinator repeated it again\nduring a visit to State House in Uganda in May 2005 (New Vision, 2005). For reasons\nalready discussed, it has to be set aside as nonsense. Nevertheless, it is clear that\nUgandan rates have not risen in the way they have in southern Africa. The usual\nexplanations for this relate to policy interventions, and Uganda has become a\nbenchmark for what governments, international agencies and activists should try to\ndo elsewhere. But what is the evidence that it is policy interventions that have made\nthe difference? It turns out that there is surprisingly little.\nAlthough it is often ignored, a crucial point in assessing HIV\/AIDS policy in\nUganda is that the epidemic in significantly older than in southern Africa. This is\nimportant for two reasons. First, it is reasonable to expect that HIV\/AIDS, like any\nother epidemic, will run a natural course. Its virulence within a particular population\nwill decline over time. How long this will take with HIV\/AIDS is unknown, but it is\npossible that the declines in infection rates noted in parts of Uganda may reflect such\na trend. It needs to be borne in mind that most of the Ugandan population reside in\nrelatively stable rural locations, and this may have contributed to less genetic\nproliferation of the virus (there appears to be little of the virulent HIV-1 Clade C).\nSecond, a disease locally referred to as \u2018slim\u2019 had already been causing deaths for\nsome time in south-west Uganda before those infected were diagnosed as having\nHIV\/AIDS in 1982\/3. Experience of AIDS-like symptoms and excessively high\nmortality was already quite widespread in some places. This alone may be a reason\nAIDS and evidence: some Ugandan myths 19\nfor some of the declines in recorded prevalence. It is also quite possible that\nbehaviour had already begun to change in the south-west of the country as soon as\nthe link with AIDS was made, and before the national HIV\/AIDS programme was\nset up in 1987\/88. This seems to be an implication of the Rakai and Masaka\npopulation studies, which indicate that incidence must have been stabilizing for\ncertain age cohorts for some time (Parkhurst, 2002).\nSo it could be that policy measures had relatively little to do with the apparent\nUgandan success. There is, however, evidence that some of the campaigns have been\nvery effective in changing attitudes and perceptions. Although it is hard to show that\nthey directly changed behaviour, they did quickly increase awareness of the disease in\nKampala and southern parts of the country. As in Botswana, which introduced\nprogrammes at about the same time, the symptoms of AIDS were often incorporated\ninto local bio-moral interpretations of affliction. But, unlike Botswana, the diversity\nof Ugandan society mitigated against a cohesive alternative explanation of the disease.\nVarious, relatively small-scale cults of affliction emerged, but there was less resistance\nto the formal public health care messages. Indeed, one of the most remarkable aspects\nof the HIV\/AIDS campaigns in Uganda is the way they have involved everyone\nincluding international agencies, NGOs, government ministers and journalists, to pop\nstars, Catholic priests, local councils and soldiers. There has indeed been a\nconsiderable degree of mass mobilization. Not surprisingly, the combination of\napparently declining HIV rates has been associated with this level of activism, and\nvarious myths have sprung up about how it has been possible. Perhaps the most\nimportant have been those associated with \u2018ABC\u2019 and those about leadership.\nThe debate about ABC in Uganda is in itself something of a myth. It has been\nclaimed that the Ugandan model of HIV\/AIDS control is due to an integrated\nstrategy based on \u2018A for abstinence (or delayed sexual initiation among youth), B for\nbeing faithful (or reduction in number of sexual partners), and C for correct and\nconsistent condom use, especially for casual sexual activity and other high-risk\nsituations\u2019 (USAID, 2004). Actually, use of the ABC acronym seems to have\noriginated in Botswana, where it failed dismally (Heald, 2002). Certainly I saw no sign\nof it in Uganda between the 1980s up to the mid-1990s, and veteran AIDS\ncampaigners in Uganda have been reported as stating that they had never heard\nabout it until 2001 (Human Right Watch, 2005, p. 5). Claims about its relevance in\nUganda seem to originate from USAID. But even if the term was not actually used\nin awareness campaigns, it does capture two of the main approaches to encouraging\nbehavioural change in Uganda \u2013 on the one side promotion of abstinence and\nfaithfulness, and on the other the promotion of condoms.\nIn recent years this combination of potentially complementary strategies has\nopened up into a fierce, polarized conflict. It has been prompted by both large\namounts of money being made available by the US Government for HIV\/AIDS\ncontrol programmes, and a simultaneous shift away from support for condom\npromotion (one member of staff at Mulago hospital in Kampala observed to me that\nABC now means \u2018Anything But Condoms\u2019!). Some of those appalled by the new\napproach have castigated anyone who questions the significance of condoms in\nreducing rates of infection as right-wing Republican stooges. In response, there have\nbeen assertions about the Ugandan HIV prevention strategies being undermined by\n20 T. Allen\n\u2018infuriated UN condom-pushers\u2019 (AIDS and Anthropology Bulletin, 2003; Green\n2003, 2004; Life Site, 2005). On both sides of the divide there has been a fair amount\nof myth-making. The adopting of positions for ideological, financial and political\npurposes has once again had a tangential connection with what has happened on the\nground in Uganda itself. Human Rights Watch, for example, in a generally excellent\ndiscussion and analysis of HIV\/AIDS in Uganda, has felt the need to criticize the\ncurrent emphasis on abstinence by some powerful groups as a \u2018life-threatening\u2019 shift,\norchestrated and funded by the US (BBC, 2005; Human Rights Watch, 2005).\nA problem is that, whatever one thinks about the usefulness of condoms, they\nwere largely absent from the Ugandan scene until the mid-1990s except in some urban\nlocations. In the late 1980s President Museveni had been involved in an informal\nalliance with the traditionally Catholic Democratic Party. Partly for this reason, but\nalso partly because of his own beliefs and attitudes, condoms were not vigorously\npromoted. Indeed, Museveni and other ministers made speeches denouncing condoms\nas un-African and raising doubts about their efficacy as a form of protection. Over\nthe years this line has been moderated, but Museveni has continued to down-play the\nimportance of the barrier method (e.g. New Vision, 2004). He has argued that the\nUgandan \u2018success\u2019 has been to do with the promotion of \u2018family values\u2019, and the First\nLady has explicitly associated HIV\/AIDS declines in Uganda with abstinence and the\nChristian faith (e.g. Museveni, 2003). It is a position that makes them rather popular\nwith certain Republican politicians in the US, but it is not simply a sudden change\nof policy in response to demands from US aid donors. The slogans used in the early\nawareness campaigns included \u2018love carefully\u2019, \u2018love faithfully\u2019 and \u2018zero grazing\u2019. As\nlate as 1991, donated condoms were being kept in stores in Entebbe because of\ngovernment resistance to their distribution. This subsequently changed, and by\nmid-decade there were rural condom distribution points in certain places, but there is\nlittle evidence that they were having a significant effect.\nIn 1996, I investigated condom use in and around Kasensero (the village in Rakai\nDistrict where the first Ugandan cases of AIDS had been diagnosed). I found that\nmost informants had no knowledge of how to use them correctly, and that only\nfishermen were asking for them regularly (BBC\/Open University, 1996; Allen &\nHeald, 2004). At the same time, results from the two population studies in the\nsouth-west of the country confirmed that condom use was not an important factor in\nthe noted declines in incidence. They both indicated that a much more likely cause\nwas later age of sexual debut in girls (Mulder, 1996a, b).\nRecently a group of US-based scholars have taken issue with such an interpret-\nation, or rather have suggested that the situation may have changed since the\nmid-1990s (Wawer et al., 2005). Using results from the population study in Rakai\nthey find that high AIDS-related mortality accounts for most of the recorded declines\nin prevalence between 1994\/5 and 2002\/3. They also find that during this period\nincidence did not decline overall. Nor did it do so in young adults or in adolescents.\nReported age of sexual debut declined in both sexes, and the proportions of young\nadults reporting sexual activity, non-marital relationships and multiple partners\nincreased. However, reported condom use increased (e.g. from 19% to 38% in males\naged 15\u201316). They concluded that there had been no increase in abstinence or\nfaithfulness, and that the stable incidence rates were associated with increased use of\nAIDS and evidence: some Ugandan myths 21\ncondoms. Although at the time of writing only an abstract of this study has been\nmade available, the fact that it was presented by an eminent group of epidemiologists\nat an important international conference has meant that it has been reported widely\nand taken seriously. It has been interpreted as showing that abstinence programmes\nare failing and that condom use should be encouraged (e.g. Reuters, 2005).\nHowever, it could be that a rise in age of sexual debut and a decrease in casual\nsexual activity had occurred before 1994 in Rakai, as monitoring up to that point\nsuggested, and that sexual activity amongst some groups changed as condoms become\nmore readily available. This would not be surprising. Studies from elsewhere in Africa\nsuggest that increased availability of condoms coincides with such behaviour (Allen\n& Heald, 2004). Also, reports by anthropologists and others working in the area have\ncontinued to suggest that condom use remains inconsistent and too low to be a\nsignificant factor in keeping incidence rates down (Green, 2005; Mosley, 2005). So\nanother interpretation of the latest results from Rakai could be that the increased\nstress on condoms from the mid-1990s has had the effect of undermining earlier\nmessages about abstinence and faithfulness. In other words, it has been counter-\nproductive. Elsewhere in the country, for example in the north, condom availability\nhas remained very low. Yet antenatal prevalence rates have continued to decline.\nCaution may be required in interpreting these data, but they too suggest that\nhighlighting the value of condoms in response to pressure from certain Christian and\nright-wing interests may lead to unhelpful exaggerations.\nLastly, some points need to be made about leadership and mass mobilization in\nUganda. President Museveni himself has been closely associated with promulgating\nthe idea that he and his government have achieved great things in the campaign\nagainst HIV\/AIDS. It is a claim that is generally accepted; even by those who disagree\nabout particular strategies, or who take into account other reasons that might help\nexplain the declines in reported infection rates. There has clearly been a considerable\namount of myth-making here. It actually took a while for Museveni\u2019s government to\naccept the seriousness of the situation. In April 1987, J. Carswell, one of the team of\ndoctors that had been involved in diagnosing AIDS in Rakai in 1982\/3, was expelled\nfrom the country for talking too openly to journalists (Putzel, 2003). Nevertheless, it\nis certainly true that by the late 1980s the President was fully engaged in AIDS\nawareness promotion and that, in contrast with Botswana, his government, together\nwith relevant agencies, succeeded in communicating about HIV\/AIDS to the\npopulation at large in ways that were not resisted (Allen & Heald, 2004). In August\n1991, a survey of around 1400 informants was carried out in the relatively cut-off\nMoyo District, located in the north-west of the country, where I had been living since\n1987. It found that more than 90% of respondents had heard of AIDS, about 30%\nknew of someone with AIDS and over 60% believed that \u2018sex with many people\u2019 was\na cause of transmission (Schopper, 1991). At least in part, this remarkable acceptance\nof the health messages was because condoms were not a primary focus of the\ncampaigns, and alliances had been formed with religious leaders, traditional authori-\nties, elders and the newly introduced and directly elected local councils. As elsewhere\nin Uganda, the AIDS campaigns played a part in processes of supporting authority\nsystems, reinforcing ideas about moral probity and institutionalizing patrilineal\nhierarchies.\n22 T. Allen\nIn this respect, President Musevini\u2019s own claim that the Ugandan \u2018success\u2019 was\nbased on traditional family values is much more than just rhetoric. Rather it seems\nto have been a deliberate strategy, with ramifications that have barely been perceived\nby most analysts. In Moyo District, councils tried to control activities of young\npeople at dances, monitor the movement of certain women (and occasionally certain\nmen), and mediate in various kinds of disputes. These disputes often related to\npayments of bride-wealth, or to the sexual activities of women for whom no\nbride-wealth had been paid. In some instances the councils were prepared to act\nviolently, for example by forcing certain individuals to leave a neighbourhood. They\nalso became involved in hearing cases where someone, usually a woman, was accused\nof inyinya (witchcaft\/poisoning). On a number of occasions they executed or tortured\na person found guilty, sometimes with the active support of soldiers stationed in the\nvicinity. Once HIV\/AIDS messages started to spread, with the Catholic Church in the\ndistrict playing a leading role and echoing the President\u2019s call for sexual restraint,\nlocal council activities appeared to have governmental and church support, and to be\nin the interests of public health. Indeed, the term inyinya started to be used for people\nwho might be infected (Allen, 1989, 1991b, 1992, 1994b, 1997). The HIV\/AIDS\ncampaigns were thus integrated into and helped invigorate local institutions, not\nnecessarily in ways that many analysts would expect.\nUncomfortable conclusions\nInterrogating evidence and myths about HIV\/AIDS in Uganda leads us to uncom-\nfortable conclusions. Much less is known about the epidemic than is asserted. Even\nbasic questions about what exactly has affected incidence and prevalence rates remain\nunanswered. Many theories, such as those about risk groups, sexuality and military\nactivity, can be shown to be largely speculative. It is also possible that policy\nmeasures have had a relatively marginal effect. To the extent that they have, condom\nuse does not seem to have been particularly important, although this may have been\nchanging in some places, notably in the more urbanized parts of the south.\nLimitations on sexual contact might be more significant in affecting overall trends,\nalthough this too probably varies in different parts of the county.\nWhere changes in patterns of sexual contact have occurred, they may have been\nlinked with social control procedures. In the IDP camps in the war zone of the north\nconstraints on daily life are extreme, and they seem to be linked to declining rates.\nElsewhere in the country, the regulation of social activities by local councils,\npatrilineal hierarchies, religious leaders and other groups may have sometimes played\na similar role. It underlines an important point that is curiously absent in most of the\nAIDS literature on Uganda. Behavioural change rarely happens because of infor-\nmation alone. It occurs when information is combined with effective mechanisms of\nsocial control, sometimes including enforced compliance. In Africa, most people\ncannot simply choose a different way of life. They live in circumstances in which\nindividual agency and opportunity is very limited. For women, constraints on their\nactions can be extreme. When it comes to sex, they are rarely in a position to freely\nopt for \u2018abstinence\u2019 or \u2018condoms\u2019. Rather they live their lives according to locally\naccepted social and moral norms. Ignoring this fact is to indulge in wishful thinking,\nAIDS and evidence: some Ugandan myths 23\nand it is something that may prove alarmingly counterproductive if it is extended to\ntreatment with ARVs (anti-retrovirals). This unfortunately seems to be the case.\nA new myth has emerged in Uganda that anti-retrovirals can provide adequate\ntreatment for AIDS. President Museveni has been making speeches calling on people\nto come for testing now that treatment is available, and a host of aid agencies have\njumped on the anti-retroviral bandwagon. But this treatment remains very limited,\nand there are massive problems with unequal access and with monitoring. Although\nsome programmes run from clinics have established methods for ensuring that\npatients adhere to treatment indefinitely, many drugs are obtained privately with little\nor no medical advice. Anti-retrovirals have become available at private pharmacies,\nand even reputable hospitals, such as that at Lacor near Gulu, have what is termed\na \u2018cash and carry\u2019 window. Staff at Mulago, the main government hospital in\nKampala, complained to me in mid-2005 that both generic drugs and brand drugs are\nflooding into the country from a wide range of formal and informal sources. A\nconsequence is resistance and genetic mutation of the virus. Already many patients\nare arriving at Mulago with forms of HIV that do not respond to first-line treatment\nprocedures. It is possible that one reason HIV rates have not exploded in Uganda in\nthe way that they have in southern Africa is because genetic mutation has been more\nlimited. The current unregulated enthusiasm for ARV treatment should therefore be\na cause of concern, not complacency. The Uganda \u2018success story\u2019 is not written in\nstone. It is a mistake to assume it will last forever.\nAcknowledgment\nResearch and writing of this paper was supported by a grant from the UK\u2019s\nDepartment of International Development to the Crisis States Research Centre of the\nLondon School of Economics.\nReferences\nAccorsi, S., Fabiani, M., Lukwiya, M., Ravera, M., Costanzi, A., Ojom, L. et al.

Districts in the\ncentral north of the country were not covered in the survey. However, even allowing\nfor a southern and urban bias, there seems to have been a problem with the way it\nwas organized. The categories of \u2018midwife\u2019 and \u2018nurse\u2019 were not treated separately in\nthe questionnaires. The survey claims that just 1% of Uganda women receive\nantenatal care from \u2018traditional birth attendants\u2019. If this is really so, I must have\ninadvertently interviewed almost all of them!
