EVANS, H. GRASSLER & J. POUWELS (Eds) 1997 \nFreiburg im Breisgau, Fillibach Verlag \n232 pp., paperback, ISBN 3 931240 03 7 \n \nThis volume, published in Germany with the support of the European Commission, \nis the product of a collaboration (Socrates and later Erasmus funded) which brings together \nnine contributors from seven countries. The project was eventually called \"Building \nBridges\" and the book begins with a commentary on a Rembrandt painting of a \nbridge, which forms the book cover. The theme is broad\u2014human rights and values \neducation as these relate to the school curriculum and textbooks. Each writer \ninterprets this differently, some not achieving a balanced focus. Overall, the contributions \nconsist of a collection of progress reports: many had not completed everything \nthey set out to do. The English style throughout is patchy but acceptable: for \nexample the series' strap-line is \"to think Europe through values looking at Human \nRights\". \nThe underlying philosophy is that issues of human values, rights and responsibilities \nshould be at the centre of education, resulting in a Europe unified through \na shared understanding of human rights and values. The book is not, however, this \ncoherent. Each chapter is drawn from a national contribution to the project. Some \nfocus on human rights, some on values and some on the European dimension. The \nresult is poorly focused, confused still further by an undefended identification of the \nmain themes with \"citizenship education\". Nevertheless, these project reports do \nprovide a contribution to European debate. \nIn an opening discussion of values education, Pouwels focuses on identity in a \ncontext of \"post-modern\" instability of ideology and the disorientation stemming \nfrom the weakening of frames of reference such as provided by religion, politics and \npersonal idealism. The drive for personal autonomy means that people are making \ntheir own choices and need guidance. Autonomy without boundaries produces \n\"monsters of children\". In a collective identity crisis, enhanced personal autonomy \ncan mean a loss of identity and roots. This implies that values education has to \naddress issues of nationality, freedom, democracy, human rights and identity within \na European and international perspective. \nThis raises interesting issues. Personal autonomy without any respect for other \npeople, of course, produces self-centredness. That may be sharpened by competitive \nclimates which values high achievement (and conversely criticises low achievement, \ndisadvantaging some in the school community); but education takes place within \ncommunity\u2014the school, the family, the locality, the nation. Socialisation in these \ncommunities gives boundaries, as pupils relate to each other and learn what is and \nwhat is not acceptable. Nationhood raises interesting questions: it confers a sense of \nidentity with rituals, badges\/flags and allegiances, and a national \"story\" (history) \nabout how the nation has fared in the past. This package has implicit values. \nHowever, the sense of nationhood might define who is to be respected or accepted, \nand who is not. That is, nationhood implies insularity and narrow-mindedness. \nMany times in history it has also stimulated intolerance, prejudice and aggression to \nthose outside (and also outsiders within the nation). This has been seen at its most \nextreme and grotesque in \"ethnic cleansing\", but exists everywhere as racism or \nnational prejudice. \n 1\nThe task therefore is to define identity in terms which assist European and \nglobal integration. Identity is itself complex and is not static. It may involve religious \nallegiance (Christian, Muslim, Hindu) but not define the nature of that allegiance \n(fundamentalist, liberal, etc.). Secularism produces people who are Christian, Jewish, \nMuslim by culture but secular in outlook and ideology. A locality may become \nculturally mixed: the result might be harmonious or acrimonious. Education is \ninvolved with the process of people building relationships and, through an appreciation \nof other people's needs and aspirations, understand where the boundaries to \ntheir behaviour lie. At a national level, these interlocking cultures all have a place. \nA British citizen may be black or white, of Asian, European or African ancestry, \nworshipping in any religion; and this affects what we mean by the word \"British\". \nEach will have a different view of their identity which will combine their backgrounds \nwith their current position. For a black British Muslim, all three words are \nimportant. \nEvans (section 3.2) addresses implications of citizenship for the curriculum, or \n\"how we educate our young people for their roles as citizens\" (p. 37). This is viewed \nin terms of rights and duties, of values and relationships. Evans sets the problematic \nterms such as justice and democracy against the insistence of English National \nCurriculum documentation about what values should be inculcated. He stresses that \nour task is \"critical scrutiny\" of what values imply for the present and future world. \nJan Pouwels, commenting on the Netherlands, notes that there is little encouragement \nin law, attainment targets or text books for values education and sets this \nin a historico-political setting of freedom of education which prevents government \ninterference (but what is a \"strongly pillarised society\", p. 157?). He argued from \ntolerance: the Netherlands are internationally known for \"great tolerance\" and for \nbeing egalitarian. There has \"never\" been severe political oppression or individual \nexploitation in the Netherlands; therefore education in human values and rights are \ndeemed unnecessary. Pouwels clearly discounts the Nazi years, which might have \ncreated a backlash in Dutch law. \"Tolerance\" is a slippery word stressing who or \nwhat is tolerated rather than what values are respected. Too much legal tolerance \ncan be viewed as licence. Does tolerance to peoples mean tolerance of their values \nor does every incomer have to become Dutch? Tolerance as a legal device is not the \ncounter to oppression. To be tolerated in a country where your identity, beliefs and \naspirations are not recognised or respected and not represented in law, society or \neducation can feel like oppression. Pouwels argues for values-orientated education \n(but see 'valuable education, p. 158) to develop identity and autonomy. To these \nshould be added respect, relationships, social responsibility and so on, the outward-looking \nvalues as well as the inward. \nThis book needed more careful editing both in terms of language and in terms \nof overall coherence. Interesting issues are raised about values and human rights \neducation, much superficially descriptive. It cries out for a thorough-going debate of \nthese important issues and principles, which it reveals as having been neglected by \nthe contributing countries of the European Union. \n \nDr Stephen Bigger, formerly Westminster College, Oxford OX2 9AT, UK. \nNow: University of Worcester, UK.
