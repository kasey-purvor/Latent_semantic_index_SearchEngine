INTRODUCTION\nTextures are classical solutions which are characterized by\na nonzero homotopy group pd(T), d being the number of\nspace dimensions. The relevant systems typically involve a\nscalar field F taking values in the target space T. With a\nLagrangian such as u]mFu2, and for d>2, configurations are\nprone to implode ~by the usual Derrick scaling argument!. In\nan expanding universe, textures might be stabilized by the\ncosmological expansion; but we are interested here in cases\nwhere gravitational effects are negligible, and we take space-\ntime to be flat. In flat space, the best-known way of stabiliz-\ning textures is to add a Skyrme term involving higher powers\nof ]mF .\nBy contrast, vortices or monopoles correspond to a non-\ntrivial pd21(T), and ~in their \u2018\u2018local\u2019\u2019 versions! are stabilized\nby gauge fields. Many similarities between textures and vor-\ntices or monopoles have been noted. For example, multi-\nSkyrmions and Bogomol\u2019nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield ~BPS!\nmultimonopoles ~located at a single point in space! each\nhave a polyhedral structure corresponding to an appropriate\nsubgroup of O(d), and this has been partly understood in\nterms of rational maps from the Riemann sphere to itself @1#.\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the stabilization of\ntextures by gauge fields, and so in particular it explores a\ndifferent sort of relation between the two classes of topologi-\ncal solitons, generalizing the example provided by the\nsemilocal vortex @2,3#.\nThe idea of stabilizing textures with gauge fields has been\ninvestigated before. One motivation has been the fact that\nSkyrme terms are non-renormalizable, whereas gauge theo-\nries may have better quantum behavior; but in this paper the\nconsiderations are entirely classical. For the extended\nAbelian-Higgs model ~with the Higgs field being a complex\ndoublet!, it was pointed out in @4# that an expansion in field\ngradients produced a Skyrme-like term, which suggested sta-\nbility; at the time, this was not investigated in detail. More\nrecent numerical simulations @5# seemed to show that stabil-\nity was indeed present ~although, as reported below, we have\nnot been able to confirm this result!. In a different Abelian\nsystem ~involving a triplet of real scalar fields and a massive\nAbelian gauge field! no stable textures could be found @6#.\nFor the non-Abelian case, scaling arguments again suggest\nstability ~cf. @7#!; but detailed investigation such as @8# have\nproduced negative results. The conclusion seems to be that\nthe scalar field and the gauge field have to be linked to each\nother sufficiently strongly in order to prevent each from col-\nlapsing independently; and in \u2018\u2018standard\u2019\u2019 systems, this link\nis not strong enough.\nThe general framework is as follows. Suppose we have a\nsystem involving a gauge field ~with gauge group G), and a\nmultiplet F of scalar fields coupled to it. The \u2018\u2018basic\u2019\u2019 La-\ngrangian of the system has the form\nL5 12 uDmFu22 14 ~Fmn!22V~F!. ~1!\nFor space dimension d52, the system defined by Eq. ~1!\nmay admit stable static solutions ~for example, semilocal\nvortices!; but for d53 it seems not to\u2014some modification is\nneeded. The idea pursued here is that the term uDmFu2 in the\nLagrangian involves a choice of metric on the space T in\nwhich F takes its values, and we can change this metric. For\nexample, if F is a complex vector, then the standard Euclid-\nean metric is uDFu25(DF\u2020)(DF), where DF\u2020 denotes the\ncomplex-conjugate transpose of DF . A natural modification\nof this ~see the following section! is to add a term\nk2uF\u2020DmFu2, where k is a constant. So we now have a\nfamily of systems, parametrized by k . Taking the limit k\u2192\u2018\nenforces the constraint\nF\u2020DmF50, ~2!\nwhich ~under favorable circumstances! determines the gauge\npotential in terms of F . So we have a family of systems\nwhere, in an appropriate limit, the gauge degrees of freedom\ndisappear, and the Maxwell or Yang-Mills term (Fmn)2 be-\ncomes a Skyrme term. This enables us to track a soliton\nsolution as it changes from a gauge-stabilized texture into a\nSkyrme-stabilized texture. In an appropriate limit of param-*Email address: richard.ward@durham.ac.uk\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 66, 041701~R! ~2002!\n0556-2821\/2002\/66~4!\/041701~5!\/$20.00 \u00a92002 The American Physical Society66 041701-1\neters k , . . . \u2192\u2018 , one gets a Skyrme system which certainly\nadmits stable solitons; one question is for which finite values\nof these parameters there are stable solitons.\nNon-trivial examples of this idea have only been found in\nthe Abelian case G5U(1), and these are described in Secs.\nII and III ~for d52 and d53, respectively!. A discussion of\nthe non-Abelian case @G5SU(2) in d53# is given in the\nSec. IV. The conclusion, therefore, is that textures can be\nstabilized by ~Abelian! magnetic fields, but no non-Abelian\nversion of this appears to be known.\nIt might be noted that the idea of adding a term\nk2uF\u2020DmFu2, and investigating how solitons depend on the\nparameter k , has been investigated before; the simplest ex-\nample ~in a somewhat different context! is that of the CP1\nmodel with no gauge field @9#.\nII. SEMILOCAL VORTICES AND PLANAR SKYRMIONS\nIn this section we take d52 ~so space is the plane R2),\nand gauge group U~1!. Let the Higgs field F be a complex\ndoublet F5@F1 F2# t. The resulting extended Abelian-\nHiggs system admits semilocal vortex solutions @2,3#; and in\nthe limit k\u2192\u2018 it becomes, as we shall see, a Skyrme version\nof the CP1 model. The generalization with F being an\nM-tuplet, leading in the limit to a Skyrme version of the\nCPM21 model, is straightforward; but for simplicity we shall\nrestrict ourselves here to the CP1 case.\nThe standard Lagrangian is\nL5 12 ~DmF!\u2020~DmF!2 14 ~Fmn!22 18 l~12F\u2020F!2, ~3!\nwhere DmF5]mF2iAmF . For the semilocal vortex solu-\ntion, the gauge field provides a \u2018\u2018hard core\u2019\u2019 which prevents\nthe soliton from shrinking. If 0,l,1, the single soliton is\nstable; but for l.1 it is unstable ~it expands without limit!\n@10,11#. For l51 there is a one-parameter family of static\nsolutions saturating a Bogomolny bound, but these solitons\nare marginally unstable @12#. One member of this family is\n~an embedding of! the standard Nielsen-Olesen vortex.\nVarious relations between this system and the CP1 model\nhave been noted before ~cf. @4,13#!. For example, imposing\nthe constraint F\u2020F51 ~this corresponds to letting the pa-\nrameter l tend to infinity!, and scaling away the (Fmn)2 term\nleaves the CP1 model @13#. But in order to have stable\nsemilocal vortices which become Skyrmions as a limiting\ncase, one needs to make some modifications.\nRecall, first, the symmetry of this system @3#. The un-\ngauged system has an SO~4! global symmetry. On gauging a\nU~1! subgroup, this SO~4! is reduced to the product of the\nlocal U~1! and a global SU~2!; the field F belongs to the\nfundamental representation of this SU~2!. The most general\nSU~2!-invariant metric on T5C2 is hPQDFPDF\u00af Q, where\nhPQ~F ,F\u00af !5g~j!dPQ1g\u02dc ~j!F\u00af PFQ ~4!\nand j5F\u00af PFP5F\u2020F . The two functions g and g\u02dc are arbi-\ntrary. But in the limit l\u2192\u2018 , which is of particular interest\nhere, we have j[1; so let us take g and g\u02dc to be constants,\nscaling g to unity and writing g\u02dc5k2. Using this modified\nmetric instead of the standard Euclidean one amounts to re-\nplacing Eq. ~3! by\nL5 12 ~DmF!\u2020~DmF!1 12 k2uF\u2020DmFu22 14 ~Fmn!2\n2 18 l~12F\u2020F!2. ~5!\nThe second modification is as follows. In order to have\nstability for l.1, we need an extra potential term, which\nnecessarily breaks the SU~2! global symmetry ~see for ex-\nample @14,15#!. We shall add to Eq. ~5! the term auF2u2,\nwhere a is a positive constant. In the Bogomolny case (k\n50 and l51), there is now a unique minimium: it has\nF250, and is the Nielsen-Olesen vortex with energy E\n5p .\nWith these two modifications, the static energy density E\nof the system is given by\n2E5~D jF!\u2020~D jF!1k2uF\u2020D jFu21~B j!21V~F!, ~6!\nwhere V(F)5 14 l(12F\u2020F)212auF2u2, and where B j\n5e jkl]kAl is the magnetic field strength.\nThe boundary conditions are chosen to ensure finite en-\nergy. At spatial infinity, one must have ~a! A j5 f 21] j f ,\nwhere u f u51; ~b! D jF50)F5 f 21K , where K is a con-\nstant 2-vector; and ~c! V(F)50)K5@k 0# t with uku51.\nBecause of ~b! and ~c!, F cannot be zero at spatial infinity;\nand in order for F to be single valued, f has to be single\nvalued. Hence f is a map from the circle at spatial infinity to\nthe gauge group U~1!, and the degree of f is the soliton\nnumber N. The total magnetic flux is proportional to N, in the\nusual way. The fact that there is nontrivial topology does not\nnecessarily mean that there are stable solitons; but the nu-\nmerical work described below indicates that there are, at\nleast for certain ranges of the parameters a , l and k .\nTaking the limit l\u2192\u2018 enforces the constraint F\u2020F51\n~so F takes values in S3). If in addition k\u2192\u2018 , then the\nminimum-energy configuration approaches one for which\nF\u2020D jF50, and hence\nA j52iF\u2020] jF . ~7!\nWith A j given in terms of F by this expression,\n(D jF)\u2020(D jF) becomes the standard CP1 energy, and (B j)2\nbecomes a Skyrme term. We can reexpress this as an O~3!\nsigma model in the usual way: define a unit 3-vector field fW\nby fW 5F\u2020sW F , where sa are the Pauli matrices. This corre-\nsponds to the standard Hopf map from S3 ~the space F\u2020F\n51) to S2. Strictly speaking, the F field is a vortex ~wind-\ning at spatial infinity!; but the fW field, obtained from it by\nprojection, is a texture ~constant at spatial infinity!.

The result is summarized in Fig. 1, which shows\nthe energy E as a function of k>0. It was obtained by as-\nsuming the standard form for O~2!-symmetric fields, namely\nF15 f (r)exp(iNu), F25g(r), Ar50 and Au5a(r), where\nf, g, and a are real valued. The discrete version of the energy\nfunctional E@ f ,g ,a# was then minimized numerically, using\na conjugate-gradient method. For each value of k , a stable\nsolution was found. Note that, as expected, E goes from E\n5p ~the Nielsen-Olesen vortex! at k50 and l51, to E\n53.1557p ~the planar Skyrmion! as k\u2192\u2018 and l\u2192\u2018 .\nIII. VORTEX RINGS AND HOPF TEXTURES\nIn this section we investigate the same system ~5! as be-\nfore, but in spatial dimension d53. The extra potential term\nis omitted ~in other words, a50), so the global SU~2! sym-\nmetry is unbroken. One may form a texture configuration by\ntaking a finite length of semilocal vortex with its ends joined\ntogether to form a loop in 3-space, and it has previously been\nspeculated that such a texture might be stable @4,5#.\nThe energy density is given by Eq. ~6!, with a50; so the\nsystem depends on the two parameters l and k . In the limit\nl ,k\u2192\u2018 , we again get an S3-valued scalar field F , with the\ngauge potential being given by Eq. ~7!; it has previously\nbeen pointed out ~cf. @18,19#! that this limit is equivalent to\nthe Faddeev-Hopf system @20\u201326#. So there are stable ring\nlike solitons in the limit; the question here is whether they\nare stable for finite values of k and l .\nThe boundary conditions imply, as before, that F\n5@F1 F2# t5 f 21K at r5\u2018 , where K is a constant 2-vector;\nso W5F1\/F2 is constant at spatial infinity. Thinking of W\nas a stereographic coordinate for CP1 therefore shows that\nF ~provided it is nowhere zero! defines a map from R3 to S2\nwhich is constant at infinity, and hence is classified topologi-\ncally by the Hopf number NPp3(S2). For N51, the field\nresembles a single vortex ring. The stability of such N51\nconfigurations has been investigated numerically, again by\nminimization of the energy functional. The solitons cannot\nbe spherically symmetric, but one expects that for small\nvalues of N they will be axially symmetric @21,22#. So\none can reduce the problem to a two-dimensional one\nwhich is not too difficult computationally. More precisely,\none can use cylindrical coordinates, and impose an SO(2)\n3SO(2)-invariant ansatz, as for example in @5#.\nMinima were sought for the one-parameter family of sys-\ntems obtained by setting l5k211, and stable solitons were\nfound for k>7.1. Their energy is plotted in Fig. 2. For k\n<7, however, the radius of the vortex ring shrinks to zero,\nand the field unwinds: there is no stable minimum. When\nk ~and therefore l) tend to infinity, the normalized energy\nE85E\/4p approaches the value E\u20188 51.73 ~obtained by ex-\ntrapolation of the data in Fig. 2!. This is exactly the energy of\nthe single Hopf soliton: from @26#, and allowing for different\ncoupling constants, we get the value E851.22A251.73.\nThe analogous computation previously reported in @5# for\nthe k50 case suggested that one might have stability for\nfairly small values of l ~of order unity!. The results de-\nscribed above do not confirm this, and in fact no stable so-\nlution could be found for k50, even with l quite large. But\n~as emphasized in @5#!, there might be local minima in the\nconfiguration space which are difficult to detect, and which\nrequire an initial condition which is very close to the actual\nsolution. So it remains an open question as to whether stable\nvortex rings exist for small values of k and l . It is, however,\nthe case that the configuration which is stable for k57.1,\nl551.4 collapses if k and l are reduced to k57, l550.\nIV.

Let us look at the\nthree-dimensional case (d53), with gauge group SO~3!.\nThe field F belongs to some representation G of SO~3!; so\nwe have to choose G , as well as an appropriate potential\nfunction V(F). For example, for the \u2019t Hooft\u2013Polyakov\nmonopole one uses the fundamental representation G53.\nThe simplest extension of this is the four-dimensional repre-\nsentation G51% 3. The corresponding system admits\nmonopole-like soliton solutions which have been referred to\nas semilocal monopoles @3#. ~Another simple extension is G\n53% 3, the corresponding solitons being referred to as col-\nored monopoles @11#.!\nLet us look at the 1% 3 case: so F5(f0 ,fW ) is a four-\nvector. Take the potential function to be l(12uFu2)2; so for\nlarge l , we get the constraint uFu2\u20191. One may then im-\npose texture boundary conditions ~rather than monopole\nboundary conditions!: namely, F tends to a constant as\nr\u2192\u2018 in R3. So F is effectively a map from S3 to S3, and it\nhas a winding number N. The stability of spherically sym-\nmetric N51 configurations has been studied numerically\u2014\nthe details are as follows.\nFor simplicity, we shall take the l\u2192\u2018 limit, so uFu2\n[1; and the metric on F space to be flat ~no extra term\nanalogous to k2uF\u2020D jFu2).

In other words, a and b are the\n\u2018\u2018radii\u2019\u2019 of the scalar field and the gauge field, respectively.\nMore explicitly, take f and g to have the form\nf ~r !55\nr2\n4b2\nfor 0<r<b\n1\n2 2\nb\n4r\nfor r>b 6 ,\ncos g~r !55 211\nr2\na2\nfor 0<r<a\n12\na2\nr2\nfor r>a 6 .\nOne can compute the energy E(a ,b) of this configura-\ntion exactly: it is a rational function of a and b . In partic-\nular, for b51\/a the energy has the form E(a ,1\/a)\n5a3~polynomial in a!. The salient point about this form is\nthat its minimum occurs when a50; this corresponds to the\nscalar field shrinking to zero width, while the gauge field\nspreads out. As one sees from the usual Derrick scaling ar-\ngument used in @7#, the contribution to the energy from the\nuD jFu2 term can be reduced by scaling one way, while the\ncontribution from (F jk)2 can be reduced by scaling the other\nway. But the system as a whole can never reach a balance:\nthe gauge field and the scalar field are just not sufficiently\nstrongly coupled to each other to prevent each one from col-\nlapsing separately. As was remarked before, these results do\nnot actually prove the absence of a stable solution: there\nmight still be a local minimum somewhere in the configura-\ntion space. But it seems rather unlikely that this system does\nadmit a stable texture.\nAs in the preceding sections, one can modify the metric\non F space, and this may improve the stability properties.\nThat possibility has not yet been fully investigated; but cer-\ntainly there is no gauge-invariant extra term, the vanishing of\nwhich determines the gauge potential as in the Abelian case\n~7!. So the idea of obtaining the usual Skyrme model as a\nlimit does not quite work in this non-Abelian case. Using\nother representations G , and for that matter other gauge\ngroups, opens up many more possibilities, which are still to\nbe explored. But for the time being, it remains the case that\nthere are no known examples of three-dimensional systems\nin which a texture is stabilized by a non-Abelian gauge field.\n@1# C.J. Houghton, N.S.
