Broadband, high-speed telecommunications now make it possible to\naccess, transmit and receive sound, still images, video and other data. This application is\nnormally referred to as videoconferencing (Woodruff and Mosby, 1996). It provides the\ncapability to connect two or more parties separated by distance by means of audio, video\nand data and allows opportunities for real-time interaction. It is often used by groups of\npeople who gather in a specific setting to communicate with other groups of people who\nare unable physically to be there. However, the term videoconferencing can be applied to a\nwide range of situations, such as individual-to-individual discussion and video-lecturing.\nLopez and Woodruff (1996) identify four videoconferencing formats: the interview, the\nvirtual meeting, the virtual field trip and the lecture. They state that the least productive of\nthese is normally the lecture which, they suggest, does not promote dialogue or interaction:\na lecture is as a one-way process where intellectual resources are transmitted, and as a\nlearning environment does not usually provide opportunities for students to interact with\n32\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\ntutors or between themselves. They are unlikely to establish any form of dialogue or to use\ntheir own thought processes (King and Honeybone, 1997). Whilst cost-effective in\ntraditional terms, the lecture forum can be a shallow and relatively ineffective learning\nexperience.\nThis paper describes, examines and evaluates the outcomes associated with the use of\nvideoconferencing to large audiences. This is referred to as mass conferencing. The\naudience consists of receptors (students), facilitators (tutors) and technicians at one end of\nthe conference link, and a small number of individuals, normally deliverers (lecturers) and\ntechnical support, at the other. It then illustrates that action research has been used to\ndevelop a template or framework for the efficient delivery of such activities.\nThe role of the mass conference\nLiverpool Hope University College is an ecumenical, Church foundation, higher-education\nestablishment with approximately 4,500 students, where a number of experiments using\nISDN communications technology have been carried out since early 1995. At first, simple,\none-to-one and one-to-few conferences were used to demonstrate the technology. Then a\nwide variety of different videoconferencing options were tried. These included conferences\nbetween individuals, small audience conferences (Donert, 1997), and larger group con-\nferences with up to 25 people involved, in some cases with applications being shared\n(Thornton, 1997a; Thornton 1997b).\nIt was decided that the mass conference should be developed as part of an existing teaching\nscheme. The implementation of any videoconference requires considerable organization\nand planning (Dimple, 1995). A mass-conferencing event, however, poses a range of\nadditional issues which include how to make it effective, pedagogically sound, and entirely\nrelevant to the course in question. A number of important aims were set as part of the\nmass conference: firstly, to enable a face-to-face component, with an expert in the field of\nteacher education; secondly, to try to maximize the degree of interactivity between all\nthose involved, and specifically to enable interaction between receptor (the students) and\ndeliverer (the lecturer). The final aim was to explain the delivery mechanism to the\nstudents, and to involve them in the process in order to maximize the student experience. It\nwas hoped therefore to ensure that the mass conference would generate active participation\nand limit any perceived impact the technology might have.\nThe pedagogical challenge\nThere is a considerable wealth of research literature about learning and teaching with\nvideoconferencing. Many researchers, for example Galbreath (1995) and Reed and\nWoodruff (1995), have looked specifically at the impacts of videoconferencing technology.\nThrelkeld and Brzoska (1994) and Rettinger (1996) explored the learning environments\nwhich they have created using videoconferencing technology. There have been several\nattempts (Bray et al, 1995; Richards, 1996; Gilcher, 1997; Kronlund, 1997) to classify the\npedagogical approaches used with videoconferencing. As a result, considerable guidance\n(Burge and Roberts, 1993; Schnurr and Smith, 1995) and advice (Coventry, 1996) have\nbeen made available for those who want to use it effectively. However, Gale (1992) and\nMcPhee (1997) comment that there have been relatively few evaluations of the effectiveness\n33\nKari Donert et al The design, implementation and evaluation of mass conferencing\nCourse development\nPreparatory phase\nActivity phase\nCentral component\nthe mass conference\nEvaluative phase\nFollow-up phase\nTutor\nactivities\nIdentify aims,\nplan course,\norganize mass conference,\nproduce materials.\nSurvey preparation,\ndeliver seminar;\norganization of mass\nconference.\nDeliver conference,\nintroduction (the technology\nthe pedagogy, the theme of\nthe conference), evaluate mass\nconference.\nDeliver evaluative seminar,\nfull review of course.\nAnalysis of evaluation,\nmark coursework,\nprovide feedback\nredesign course.\nStudent\nactivities\nRead literature,\nconsider ideas,\ninitial discussion.\nLiterature search,\ndiscussion,\ncontinued reading.\nParticipation,\ncritical thought,\nreflection.\nReflection,\nconsider assignment,\ngroup discussion,\nfurther reading,\ncomplete assignment\nReceive feedback,\nreflect on\nperformance.\nFigure I: Course development phases in mass conferencing\nof the technology as a teaching and learning tool. Abbot et al (1993) describe student\nvideoconferencing experiences. Their students felt that videoconferencing lent itself best to\nlectures and least to free-flowing discussions. The difficulty of generating two-way inter-\naction was seen to be caused by the technology. As for outcomes, Meisalo (1996) has\nshown that there was no significant difference in student academic performance when\nusing videoconferencing: the students involved in videoconferencing performed as well as\nthose who attended normal lectures. The students commented, however, that they disliked\nvideo lectures because it was very difficult to achieve class interaction.\nThus the challenge was to demonstrate that mass conferencing could incorporate the\nbenefits of face-to-face interaction. We also wanted to identify whether the use of the\ntechnology would have a real impact on the learning effectiveness and the attitudes of the\nstudents concerned.\n34\nALT-J Volume 6 Number I\nAt an early stage it was recognized that the learning environment created during the course\nwould be central to the level of student involvement in the mass conference. As a result,\nplanning of the whole course was co-ordinated around the mass conference. Specifically,\nthere were five course-development phases: a preparatory phase, an activity phase, the\nmass conference event, an evaluative phase and a follow-up phase (see Figure 1).\nThe pedagogical framework employed\nThree pedagogical strategies, or modes of interaction, were incorporated in the mass\nconference: collaboration mode, lecture mode and dialogue mode (see Figure 2). Lecture\nmode is a 'one-to-many' interaction, where there are distinct and unequal roles played by\nthose delivering and those participating. There is typically one lecturer, who is active in\nhis\/her approach, and many students, who are normally relatively passive. Collaboration\nmode is a 'many-to-many' interaction. Each participant is fully, though not equally,\ninvolved. There is commonly a facilitator who enables and leads the interaction. This mode\nwas used during the mass conference to create a dialogue between the audience and the\nspeaker. It was achieved by using a 'question-time' format, where students had previously\ndiscussed the literature in seminars and produced a question for the expert, which was then\nallowed to develop into a further interactive question after the response. Enquiry mode\ninvolves students in deeper thought processes, developing a critical awareness of the issues\nwhich were discussed. If the learner questions knowledge, there needs to be social\ninteraction or dialogue which is reciprocal in nature. The successful use of learning\ntechnology should provide such a dialogue (Good, 1995). It was therefore important to\ninvolve the students in the process, rather than allowing them to be simply passive\nreceptors of knowledge and ideas. This was attempted by varying the delivery mechanisms\nemployed and explaining the technology and the procedures involved.\n|mgn yldcoconftrcnce presentation!\n|lnlflal tyalnatton|\n\/ Z\ntemlntr ascntdonl |nmherrt\u00bbd1iig|\nfigure 2: Mass\nconferencing pedagogical\nstrategies\nIt has been argued (Edigo 1988, O'Malley et al 1994) that two-way videoconferencing\ncannot serve as a direct replacement for face-to-face contacts. However public figures are\nnot normally available because of limitations of time, cost and distance.\n35\nKarl Donert et al The design, implementation and evaluation of mass conferencing\nVideoconferencing can make them accessible. Other research (Schiller and Mitchell, 1992;\nBruce, 1994) indicates that videoconferencing filters and distorts many of the (often\nunconscious) signals used in face-to-face situations. These signals include lip reading, body\nmovement, gaze and eye contact. Such signals are used to regulate, maintain and progress\nverbal interactions. The mass conference sought to maximize the effectiveness of the\navailable technology in order to minimize its impacts on the delivery.\nVarying delivery styles\nThe mass conference allowed those involved in the course to provide a study unit which\ninvolved many different activities. These included background reading of recently\npublished works of the 'distant' lecturer, a seminar discussion which led to the generation,\nby each seminar group, of questions for the lecturer, a review of recent literature, the mass\nconference involving 'lecture-style' delivery then 'question-time'. The unit was concluded\nwith another seminar discussion, reflection and evaluation. Thus the mass conference was\nfully integrated into the course. The whole event was spiced up with a 'celebrity' attraction,\nProfessor Ted Wragg of Exeter University. This resulted in a very large audience with\nalmost all the students attending on the day.\nResearch method\nEvaluative surveys of the activity phase and the mass conference itself were carried out.\nThese included a quantitative survey of all participants immediately following the mass\nconference (sample size: 174). This was followed by a number of in-depth qualitative\ninterviews during the reflective phase (sample size: 6) three weeks after the mass\nconference. At the completion of the course, an analysis of the outcomes, including the\nassignments submitted by the students, standard course evaluations were undertaken, and\ninformal feedback from tutors sought.\nResearch findings\nThe quantitative survey investigated four main areas: the perceived impact of the\ntechnology, the effectiveness of 'lecture-mode', the impact of 'question time' (collaborative\nmode), and the whole experience including the discussion and literature (enquiry mode)\n(see Figure 3).\nOnly 2 per cent of the audience (four students) had ever experienced videoconferencing in\nany form. Therefore, unlocking the mystique of the technology just before the conference,\nin lay terms, is likely to have helped the audience understand some of the potential\ntechnical issues such as sound feedback and picture frame delays and so too have\nminimized the impact of technology on the audience. Taylor (1991) has suggested that\nvisual quality is important, especially for eye contact, and a sense of social presence. Sound\nquality might have posed problems, for example feedback and low volume levels were\ndifficulties identified during the trial link, so a telephone was used rather than a\nmicrophone. The results showed that the technology did not appear to have an impact on\nthe effectiveness of the mass conference.

Mean attention spans are likely to be as low as\n20 minutes (Hartley, 1997). However, the lecture part of the mass conference was very well\nreviewed. Most of the audience (87 per cent) felt that they had maintained their level of\nconcentration throughout, and that they had taken an active approach to this part of the\nmass conference (71 per cent). It was clear, however, that those who had experienced\ntechnical problems did not have a positive experience. This was to be expected, but it is\nworth noting that 56 per cent of the students felt relatively low levels of involvement in the\nlecture. This may have been a function of their location in the audience, but could also have\nbeen associated with the length of the formal presentation, which lasted about 35 minutes.\nQuestion time allowed a member of each seminar group to ask an expert a question on the\nlecture topic. Seminar groups had discussed and prepared their question in advance, and\nhad selected someone to ask it. It was hoped that this would provide the students with a\n37\nKarl Donert et al The design, implementation and evaluation of mass conferencing\nfeeling of 'ownership' of the question and thus greater involvement in this part of the mass\nconference. It was thus surprising that most of the students (61 per cent) did not feel\npersonally involved in question time, despite the fact that 93 per cent of them found the\nquestions thought-provoking.\nEvaluating the whole experience provided an opportunity to look at the effectiveness of the\nmass conference in respect of the whole course. Most of the students (70 per cent) planned\nto follow up the mass conference with reading; 86 per cent felt that the course helped\nclarify the issues; and 35 per cent planned to follow it with an assignment. A small pro-\nportion (13 per cent) were, however, sceptical of the value of the experience; almost all of\nthese students had experienced some technical difficulties.\nThe other surveys backed up the quantitative findings. Students mentioned that there were\ntechnical problems in the lecture theatre. As part of their normal course evaluation, the\ncourse was well reviewed by most students as being relevant and generating considerable\nthought. The assignment connected to the mass conference was\" selected only by a small\nproportion of the students (17 per cent), but the student outcomes were relatively high\ncompared with the other options chosen.\nConclusion\nThe technology allows the constraints of time, cost and distance to be reduced in bringing\nthe expert face to face with individual students and a large audience. Mass conferencing\ncan be an effective delivery mechanism, provided that technical issues can be resolved. The\ntransition from video-lecturing to mass conferencing also requires an effective pedagogical\napproach. Effective mass conferencing is therefore a function of the partnership between\nthose involved and the pedagogical strategies which are adopted to maintain the\nengagement of the audience. The face on the screen can more than equate with the local\nlecturer, especially when that person is a well-known expert. Perhaps this implies the\ndevelopment of the Virtual Campus, with courses that incorporate real-time input from\ninternational experts?\nIt has been possible to devise a template for successful mass conferencing which involves\nthree key areas, organization, technology and pedagogy. But it is not possible to generalize\nthe planning of mass conferencing without due consideration of the context in which it is\nto be carried out; the educational scenario, the group size, the role of the tutors and the\nlecturer, the number of sites involved, and the motivation of the participants. Considering\nthat pedagogical research has lagged far behind technological advances, it might be argued\nthat videoconferencing is still best suited to relatively low-interaction lecturing to large\ngroups. This is certainly the case if the relative costs of establishing the link are considered\nand compared with the great benefits which can result, even if using technology such as\nthis is a risky business.\nReferences\nAbbot, L., Dallat, I , Livingston, R. and Robinson, A.
