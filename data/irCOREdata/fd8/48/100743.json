INTRODUCTION\nDuring the last decade the application of projectile frag-\nmentation reactions at intermediate and relativistic energies\nto studies of nuclei far from stability has made significant\nprogress. One of the advantageous features of fragmentation\nreactions is the relatively high probability for populating\nhigh-spin isomeric states [1\u20134]. The combination of sensitiv-\nity and universality offered by projectile fragment separators,\ntogether with efficient, delayed g-ray spectroscopy of the\nselected and identified ions in metastable states, gives good\npossibilities for obtaining nuclear structure information on\nvery exotic nuclei far from stability [2,3,5\u20139].\nThe basic properties of fragmentation reactions, such as\nthe production cross sections and momentum distributions of\nthe reaction products, knowledge of which are crucial for the\ndesign and optimal operation of a fragment separator, are\nrather well known [10\u201312]. By contrast, experimental infor-\nmation on the population of states as a function of angular\nmomentum in fragmentation reactions is much more scarce,\nparticularly for projectile energies above 100A MeV. Ac-\ncording to our knowledge, the first information regarding the\npopulation of isomeric states after projectile fragmentation at\nrelativistic energies was presented by Schmidt-Ott et al. for\n43Sc populated in the fragmentation of a 500A MeV 46Ti\nbeam [1]. Recently, Pf\u00fctzner et al. published isomeric ratios\npredominantly for heavy nuclei close to the stability line,\npopulated in the fragmentation of 238U [3] and 208Pb [4]. In\nRef. [4] <20 isomeric states were identified, mainly in near\nstable rare-earth and transitional nuclei with A,180, and the\ncorresponding isomeric ratios deduced.\nHere we present the first systematic study on the angular\nmomentum population in relativistic projectile fragmentation\nfor neutron-deficient nuclei. Fifteen previously reported iso-\nmers have been identified in this work; their isomeric ratios\nwere deduced and compared with theoretical calculations.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nNeutron-deficient nuclei in the A,190 region were popu-\nlated following the projectile fragmentation of a 750A MeV\n238U primary beam impinging on a 1.6 g\/cm2 natural beryl-\nlium target. The primary beam with an intensity of 43107 in\na 10 s spill was provided by the GSI heavy-ion synchrotron\n(SIS). The fragment separator (FRS) [13], which is a mag-\nnetic zero-degree spectrometer with two dipole stages, was\nused to separate the nuclei of interest. The FRS was operated\nin the standard achromatic mode with an aluminum degrader\nat the intermediate focal plane. Niobium foils of thicknesses\n221 mg\/cm2 and 108 mg\/cm2 were placed after both the\ntarget and degrader positions, respectively, in order to maxi-\nmize the electron stripping.\nA schematic view of the experimental setup is shown in*Corresponding author.

The time of flight through the second stage of the FRS\nwas measured using scintillator detectors SC1 and SC2. The\nscintillator detector in the intermediate focal plane (SC1)\nwas also used for position measurement. At the final focal\nplane the ions were tracked using two multiwire detectors\nMW1 and MW2. The time-of-flight and flightpath informa-\ntion were used to determine the mass-to-charge ratio of the\nions [4]. The energy loss, providing Z information, was de-\ntermined by a fourfold ionization chamber (MUSIC). An alu-\nminum degrader of variable thickness was used to slow\ndown the fragments of interest and ensure their implantation\ninto a catcher. In contrast to our previous experiments with\nan aluminum catcher [14,15], a plastic catcher was used as it\nproduces less prompt radiation during the slowing down pro-\ncess of the ions. Scintillator detectors placed both before\n(SC3) and after (SC4) the catcher were used to control the\nimplantation of the ions.\nThe catcher was viewed by two segmented germanium\nClover (VEGA) [16] detectors, in order to record the g rays\nemitted from isomeric decays in the implanted ions. One of\nthe crystals had rather poor energy resolution, so only seven\ncrystals were used in the off-line analysis. The efficiency of\nthe array was 5% at a g-ray energy of 500 keV, as measured\nwith a 152Eu point source placed in the middle of the catcher.\nThe delay of g rays with respect to the implantation time of\na corresponding heavy ion was measured in two time ranges,\n0\u20138 ms and 0\u201380 ms.\nThe method is sensitive to isomers with half-lives in the\nrange from about 100 ns up to several milliseconds. The\nlower limit is determined by the time of flight through the\nFRS s,300 nsd. However, as reported previously, if the elec-\ntron conversion branch is blocked, as it is for highly stripped\nions, the effective ionic lifetime in flight is increased, allow-\ning shorter neutral atom decay half-lives to be measured\n[17,18]. The upper limit is determined by the need to corre-\nlate the individual ions to the delayed g rays.\nIII. DATA ANALYSIS\nA. Ion identification\nThe ion identification procedure applied consists of three\nsteps. The first step comes from the mass-to-charge ratio A \/q\nversus position in the intermediate focal plane matrix, as\nshown in Fig. 2(a). The two structures correspond to nuclei\nwhich do not change charge state in the degrader and those\nwhich pick up one electron, respectively. The charge state\ndistribution was calculated with the code GLOBAL [19]. It\nwas estimated that the probability of an ion being fully\nstripped is 85% in the first stage of the FRS. In the second\nstage, after the degrader, the probabilities of an ion being\nfully stripped and H-like are 57% and 36%, respectively.\nTherefore, the majority of the nuclei which do not change\nFIG. 2. Example of the ion identification procedure. A sample of\nthe full statistics is shown. (a) Position of the ions in the middle of\nthe FRS vs A \/q. The parallelograms show the selection of events\nwhich do not change charge state in the middle of FRS and those\nwhich pick up one electron, respectively. (b) Spectrum of Z as mea-\nsured by the ionization chamber. (c) Position in the middle of FRS\nvs A \/q for Pb ions selected in (a) and (b). While there is a good\nseparation between different isotopes, each ion with mass A and\natomic number Z is contaminated by nuclear species with A+2 and\nZ+1.\nFIG. 1. Schematic view of the experimental setup. For details see the text.\nK. A. GLADNISHKI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024617 (2004)\n024617-2\ntheir charge state are fully stripped in both stages of the FRS.\nSimilarly, the predominant part of those nuclei which pick up\none electron is fully stripped in the first stage and H-like in\nthe second stage of the separator.\nThe FRS was nominally set to the central transmission of\n186Pb, therefore the ions labeled with q1=q2 in Fig. 2(a) are\nnuclei in the region of 186Pb. The nuclei transmitted as H-like\nions in the second stage of the FRS are nuclei around 194Pb.\nAlthough the majority of a given species are transmitted as\nfully stripped, as predicted by the GLOBAL calculations, Fig.\n2(a) shows that a larger number of ions are actually H-like.\nThis is due to the much larger production cross section of\nnuclei around 194Pb compared with those around 186Pb.\nCross section measurements of the fragmentation of 1A GeV\n238U beam on a deuterium target indicate a ratio of\nss194Pbd \/ss186Pbd@100 [20]. All the isomers observed in\nthe current work are in nuclei transmitted as fully stripped in\nthe first stage and H-like in the second stage of FRS, in a\nsingle setting. No isomeric states were identified in nuclei\naround the fully stripped 186Pb in the current work, presum-\nably because of low statistics and\/or isomeric lifetimes for\nwhich the technique is not sensitive.\nIn the second step of the identification procedure a gate\nwas applied on the Z spectrum obtained from the energy loss\nin the ionization chamber MUSIC. As can be seen in Fig.\n2(b), the Z resolution is not good enough to separate neigh-\nboring elements cleanly.\nAfter the charge state and Z selection a new matrix of A \/q\nversus position in the intermediate focal plane was created\nfor each element, as shown in Fig. 2(c). In this way a good\nseparation could be obtained between the different isotopes\nof a given element. However, each mass A of an element\nwith atomic number Z, Z\nAX, was contaminated with Z+1\nA+2Y nu-\nclei. The level of contamination is relevant for the determi-\nnation of the isomeric ratio, and therefore is discussed later\nin Sec. III C.\nNote that the identification procedure described above is\nslightly different from the standard one (see, e.g., Ref. [4]).\nThe standard identification procedure could not be used due\nto the poor position resolution obtained for the incoming ions\nat the final focal plane.\nB. Delayed g spectra\ng-ray energy versus delay time matrices were created for\neach species. The matrices were projected on the two axes to\nachieve quantitative energy and time information. Examples\nof delayed g-ray spectra corresponding to different nuclei are\nshown in Fig. 3.\nC. Experimental isomeric ratio\nThe isomeric ratio R is defined as the probability that in\nthe reaction a nucleus is produced in an isomeric state. It was\ndetermined as outlined below [4]. The observed decay yield\nY is calculated using the following expression:\nY =\nNgs1 + atotd\neef fbg\n, s1d\nwhere Ng is the number of counts in the g-ray line depopu-\nlating the isomer of interest, atot is the total conversion co-\nefficient for this transition, bg is the absolute g-ray branching\nratio, and eef f is the g-ray detection efficiency. Among these\nquantities, the determination of the efficiency is not straight-\nforward. Since different nuclei were implanted at different\nlocations in the <20 cm long catcher, the dependence of\nFIG. 3. Delayed g-ray spectra associated with 194Pb, 195Bi, 196Pb, 197Bi, 198Po, and 200Po. The time spectra with fitted mean lifetimes are\ngiven in the insets. The g rays labeled with an asterisk in 195Bi are transitions observed for the first time in the present experiment.\nANGULAR MOMENTUM POPULATION IN THE\u0085 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024617 (2004)\n024617-3\ng-ray detection efficiency on the horizontal position must\nbe deduced. Therefore the efficiency was measured by\nplacing a calibration source at three different positions,\nand the efficiencies used for different species were inter-\npolated from these. The slowing down and stopping of\nheavy ions in the catcher were accompanied by a prompt\nburst of radiation, mainly due to bremsstrahlung f15,21g.\nSince the gate for g-ray detection allowed the recording of\nprompt radiation and only the first g ray in every channel\nwas recorded in an event, the effective efficiency for de-\nlayed radiation was reduced. In this way the efficiency\nwas reduced by about 30% swhich corresponds to approxi-\nmately two crystals out of seven being hit by the prompt\nradiationd. The number of crystals detecting prompt radia-\ntion, and therefore the corresponding efficiency lost, was\ndetermined for each nuclear species separately.\nThe isomeric ratio is given by\nR =\nY\nNimpFG\n, s2d\nwhere Nimp is the number of implanted heavy ions. F and G\nare correction factors for the in-flight isomer decay losses\nand the finite detection time of the g radiation, respectively.\nThese two quantities are calculated as\nF = expF\u2212 Slq1 TOF1\ng1\n+ lq2\nTOF2\ng2\nDG , s3d\nG = exps\u2212 ltid \u2212 exps\u2212 ltfd , s4d\nwhere TOF1 sTOF2d is the time of flight through the first\nssecondd stage of FRS, g1 sg2d is the corresponding Lor-\nentz factor, and lq1 slq2d is the decay constant for the ion\nin the charge state q1 sq2d. TOF1 and g1 were calculated\nusing the code MOCADI [22]. TOF2 was measured in the\nexperiment and was approximately 160 ns. ti and tf are the g\ndelay-time limits set in the off-line analysis to produce the\ndelayed g spectrum. For fully stripped ions, the decay con-\nstant l0 can be calculated with the following equation:\nl0 = lo\ni\nbgi\n1 + atot\ni , s5d\nwhere the summation is over all the decay branches depopu-\nlating the isomer.\nWhen more than one isomer in the same nucleus is popu-\nlated in the reaction a lower-lying isomer may be partly fed\nby the delayed decay of a higher-lying metastable state. We\nuse the definition of isomeric ratio as the probability that a\nstate is populated promptly after production of the nucleus in\nthe reaction (as in Ref. [4]). If the upper metastable state\ndecays with the probability (branching) bUL to the lower one,\nthe isomeric ratio for the lower isomer can be calculated by\nRL =\nYL\nNimpFLGL\n\u2212 bUL\nRU\nFLGL\nFlUsGU \u2212 GLd\nlL \u2212 lU\nFU\n+\nlU\n0\nlL\n0\n\u2212 lU\n0 GLsFU \u2212 FLdG , s6d\nwhere the indices \u201cL\u201d and \u201cU\u201d correspond to the lower- and\nthe upper-lying isomeric states, respectively, and the second\nterm on the right side represents the correction due to feed-\ning from the upper state. We note that the above formula\ndiffers slightly from that given in our previous work f4g and\ncorrects a minor error.\nThe majority of the quantities needed to determine the\nisomeric ratio arise from the knowledge of the level scheme\n(literature) and simple experimental considerations. How-\never, the extraction of the number of implanted ions is more\ncomplex due to the contamination. As mentioned before, the\nZ\nAX ions are contaminated with Z+1\nA+2Y nuclei. In order to deter-\nmine the level of contamination, the position at the final\nfocal plane spectrum is examined. These spectra are obtained\nafter gating on the individual isotopes of Fig. 2(c). Samples\nare shown in Fig. 4. Figure 4(a) presents the position spec-\ntrum corresponding to 86\n202Rn. This nucleus is not contami-\nnated, since no Z=87 nuclei were transmitted through the\nFRS. The bigger peak corresponds to the H-like ions and is\nFIG. 4. Samples of position spectra at the final focal plane of the\nseparator. They illustrate the applied procedure to separate the\nnucleus of interest from the contamination, as described in the text.\nK. A. GLADNISHKI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024617 (2004)\n024617-4\nfitted with a Gaussian. In the next step the position spectrum\nof 58\n200At is analyzed [Fig. 4(b)]. The peak is fitted with two\nGaussians, one for 202Rn (with fixed position and width\ntaken from the previous 202Rn spectrum) and the other for\n200At. In the subsequent steps the 198Po, 196Bi, 194Pb, and\n192Tl position spectra are examined in a similar way, consid-\nering contamination from Z+1\nA+2X nuclei. In this way the actual\nnumber of implanted ions, Nimp, is obtained, with relative\nuncertainties increasing as Z decreases. The position of the\ndifferent species obtained with the above method agrees well\nwith the MOCADI calculations.\nD. Theoretical isomeric ratio\nThe projectile fragmentation process can be described\nwith the so-called abrasion-ablation model. In the initial\nabrasion phase, a hot prefragment is created by removing a\nnumber of nucleons from the projectile. In the subsequent\nablation phase, the highly excited prefragment evaporates\nnucleons until the final fragment is formed with an excitation\nenergy below the particle emission threshold. A statistical\ng-ray cascade then proceeds down to the yrast line and along\nthis line to the ground state. If a long-lived state lies on this\ndecay path, part of the cascade may be hindered or stopped\ndepending on the lifetime of the isomer. The isomeric ratio is\nequal to the probability that the g decay from the initial\nexcited fragments proceeds via this isomeric state.\nThe Monte Carlo code ABRABLA [23] can be applied to\ndescribe the angular momentum distribution of the fragment.\nFurthermore, it has been shown that for a large mass differ-\nence between the projectile and the fragment this distribution\ncan be approximated by a simple analytical formula [24]:\nPI =\n2I + 1\n2s f\n2 expF\u2212 IsI + 1d2s f2 G , s7d\nwhere s f, the so-called spin-cutoff parameter of the final\nfragments, is given by\ns f\n2\n= kjz2l\nsAp \u2212 AfdsnAp + Afd\nsn + 1d2sAp \u2212 1d\n. s8d\nHere Ap and Af are the projectile and fragment mass num-\nbers, respectively, n is the mean number of evaporated nucle-\nons per abraded mass unit, and kjz2l is the mean square an-\ngular momentum projection of a nucleon in the nucleus. It is\ngenerally assumed that the abrasion of a nucleon induces an\nexcitation energy of about 27 MeV f25g, whereas the\nevaporation of a nucleon decreases the energy by about\n13 MeV, hence the parameter n=2 is taken. The value of\nkjz2l is estimated on the basis of a semiclassical consider-\nation of the angular momentum distribution in the Woods-\nSaxon potential f24,26g, and can be written as\nkjz2l = 0.16Ap2\/3s1 \u2212 23bd , s9d\nwhere b is the quadrupole deformation parameter of the frag-\nment. As all nuclei in the present study are situated in the\nvicinity of the Z=82 spherical shell closure, we use b=0\nfor all cases.

RESULTS\nIsomeric decays associated with 188Hg, 192Tl,\n192,193,194,195,196Pb, 195,196Bi, and 198,200,202Po nuclei were ob-\nserved. Preliminary results were reported in Refs. [31,32].\nDelayed g-ray energy spectra, as well as time spectra, are\npresented in Fig. 3. All the isomers observed in the present\nmeasurement were already reported from experiments using\nfusion-evaporation reactions. Therefore their properties\n(spin-parity, lifetimes, g-ray energies, and multipolarities)\nare reasonably well known; this is important for the isomeric\nratio determination.\nThe experimentally determined and theoretical isomeric\nratios are summarized in Table I. In addition, the lifetimes\nfrom the literature are compared with those determined from\nthe present experiment. Our lifetimes are in agreement with\nthose from the literature, but have larger uncertainties, and\ntherefore the previously published lifetimes were used for\nthe isomeric ratio determination. There are six isomeric\nstates with spin parity Ip=12+ observed in the present work,\nand their isomeric ratios as a function of mass are plotted in\nFig. 5(a).\nThe isomeric ratios given in Table I were determined by\nusing all possible g-ray transitions with energies higher than\n200 keV. Generally, transitions below 200 keV were not\nused because of the large uncertainties in the g-ray detection\nefficiency due to the wide variation in depth of implantation\ninside the catcher. The errors on the isomeric ratios are in the\nrange of 10\u201330 %. They are dominated by uncertainties in\nthe number of implanted ions (10\u201315 % uncertainty), the\ng-ray detection efficiency s<10%d, and the statistical uncer-\ntainties in the number of counts in the g-ray lines s<10%d.\nIn some cases, specifically 192Tl, 195,197Bi, 198Po, and\n200Po, the energy of the transition directly depopulating the\nisomer is unknown. However, they are known to be low\nenergy transitions below 50 keV [34,37,39\u201341,43,44]. (Note\nthat the energy of the isomeric state in 193Pb is not known\nsince the energy of the low-lying 13\/2+ state, on which the\nhigh-spin structure is built, is unknown compared to the\nground state [35].) In 202Po the energy of the transition de-\npopulating the s8+d isomer is tentatively known to be of\n22 keV [42]. The number of decays during the flight time\nthrough the FRS depends on the energies of the depopulating\ntransitions through the internal conversion coefficients.\nTherefore the value of the extracted isomeric ratio also de-\npends on the energy of the depopulating transition. For all\nthe above listed isomers the isomeric ratios were determined\nfor the two extreme assumptions, considering 0 keV (no de-\ncay in flight through the FRS) and 50 keV depopulating g\nrays. As one can see from the values given in Table II, the\nisomeric ratios are generally insensitive to the energies of the\ndepopulating transitions. Exceptions are 195,197Bi, where the\ndepopulating transition of the Ip= s29\/2\u2212d isomers has an E1\ncharacter, resulting in a large difference between\nas50 keVd=0.6 and as0 keVd=\u2018.\nAs mentioned previously, in the identification plot the Z\nAX\nnuclei were contaminated with Z+1\nA+2Y ions. In the cases of\nsome well populated isomers, the isomeric ratio could be\ndetermined even when the ions were transmitted as contami-\nnants. The obtained values from both the Z and Z\u22121 gated\nidentifications are given in Table III. Generally there is a\ngood agreement between the two values, with the exception\nof the 192Tl and 194Pb isomers. The discrepancies for these\ntwo nuclei are probably related to their trajectories, which\nare very close to the edge of the spectrometer [see Figs.\n4(e)\u20134(g)], meaning that their spatial distributions do not\nhave a Gaussian shape. The adopted isomeric ratios given in\nTable I are the averaged values.\nV. DISCUSSION\nIsomeric ratios were calculated using both the ABRABLA\ncode and the simple analytical formula.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024617 (2004)\n024617-6\nshown that for near stable nuclei the approximate formula\nreproduces the angular momentum distribution predicted by\nthe ABRABLA code rather well if the mass difference between\nprojectile and fragment is greater than 10 mass units [4].\nHowever, in the current-neutron deficient case, the situation\nis somewhat different, with the analytical formula predicting\nmuch higher angular momenta than the ABRABLA code [see\nTable I and Fig. 5(b)]. (We note that for neutron-rich nuclei\nthe analytical formula systematically underestimates the iso-\nmeric ratios [45].)\nThe predictions of the analytical formula are based on the\nnumber of nucleons removed from the projectile in the abra-\nsion step of the reaction. Since only the entire mass loss of\nthe projectile is directly observed, the number of abraded\nnucleons can be estimated after assuming that the abrasion of\none nucleon is followed by the evaporation of another two.\nAs mentioned previously, this relation is applied by choosing\nn=2, but since n represents a mean number, case-dependent\ndeviations from that rule can be expected. The production of\nneutron-deficient nuclei some way from the stability line re-\nquires larger numbers of nucleons lost from the projectile,\nwhich is achievable in long evaporation cascades. An in-\ncreased mass loss during evaporation requires higher excita-\ntion energies of the nucleus, which remains after abrasion.\nThis condition can be fulfilled if more strongly bound nucle-\nons occupying low-lying single-particle states are removed.\nHowever, according to the predictions of the shell model,\nlow-lying single-particle states possess lower angular mo-\nmenta, compared to the angular momenta of all occupied\nsingle-particle states of the projectile nucleus. Consequently\nthe required abrasion of low-lying nucleons for the produc-\ntion of exotic nuclei will imply the creation of hole states of\nlow angular momenta and the resulting spin of the prefrag-\nment will be also decreased. The interplay between the exci-\ntation energy and the spin of the prefragment is treated in the\nABRABLA code, but it is not explicitly incorporated into the\nanalytical formula. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the differences\nappear to increase for more \u201cexotic\u201d nuclei. Since the ABRA-\nBLA code should give more reliable results than the analyti-\ncal approximation, we compare the experimental values with\nits predictions.\nThe experimental isomeric ratios are generally smaller\nthan the calculated values, as shown in Table I and Fig. 6(a).\nTo understand this discrepancy we have taken a closer look\nat the assumption used in the calculations, namely, that all\nthe states with spin I. Im decay into the isomeric state (sharp\ncutoff approximation). It should also be pointed out that in\ncases where more than one isomer were observed in a given\nnucleus, the isomeric ratios obtained experimentally for the\nlower-lying states cannot be compared directly with the\nmodel because its assumption that all states with the higher\nspin decay promptly to the isomer of interest is explicitly\nviolated. In these cases the rthL\u2212bULrthU quantity should be\ncompared with the experimental value. Nevertheless, in the\nfollowing we do not discuss the population of the lower-\nlying isomeric states, since they are a less sensitive probe of\nthe theory than the higher-spin isomers.\nOne might expect that the sharp cutoff approximation\nwould be justified only for isomers lying close to the yrast\nline and the isomeric ratio should decrease with increasing\nexcitation energy of an isomer above the yrast line. Such a\ntendency was indeed observed, as described in Ref. [4]. In\nour case all the isomers correspond to yrast states, with only\none exception: the 21\/2\u2212 isomer in 195Pb lies 5 keV higher\nthan a 21\/2+ state. However, even in the case of yrast iso-\nmers, there might be transitions from higher-lying states by-\npassing the isomer and therefore reducing the isomeric ratio.\nThe effect of these bypassing transitions can be taken into\naccount as follows. The near yrast structures of several nu-\nclei studied in the present work are well known from studies\nusing fusion-evaporation reactions with heavy-ion beams.\nThese reactions are somewhat similar to projectile fragmen-\ntation with a large mass difference between fragment and\nprojectile, in the sense that they both populate states close to\nthe yrast line. Therefore the fraction w of intensity passing\nthrough the isomer as compared to the total intensity at that\nexcitation energy determined from fusion-evaporation reac-\ntions can be used to correct the isomeric ratio: rexp=Rexp \/w.\nThe quantity rexp gives the probability of populating states\nwith higher angular momentum than the isomer and can be\ndirectly compared with the theory.

The\nfactors w and rexp are given in Table IV. The accuracy of w\ndepends on the sensitivity of a given experiment, more sen-\nsitive experiments tending to lead to lower w values. The\nuncertainties on w indicated in Table IV have been increased\nrelative to the statistical value to take account of uncertain-\nties in the level scheme.\nThere are not sufficient experimental data on the level\nschemes of 192Tl, 195Bi, 202Po around the isomers, so the\nangular-momentum population in these ions cannot be com-\npared directly with the theory. We note that in 202Po there is\na higher-lying 11\u2212 isomeric state with a lifetime\nT1\/2.200 ns [42], which may be responsible for the lower\nthan predicted isomeric ratio of the 8+ state in this nucleus.\nThe situation might be similar in 195Bi in which three new\ntransitions were observed (see Fig. 3). These g rays might be\nrelated to a higher-lying isomeric state of which decay into\nthe s29\/2\u2212d isomer could explain the very low isomeric ratio.\nAlthough the level scheme of 192Pb is well known, the inten-\nsity relation between the transitions feeding the isomer and\nbypassing the isomer is not known [46], so the factor w could\nnot be determined.\nThe theoretical angular momentum population can be\ncompared with the experimental values in 188Hg,\n193,194,196Pb, 197Bi, and 198,200Po (see Table IV). The agree-\nment between theory and experiment is very good for\n193,194,196Pb, 197Bi, and 198Po. Within the error limit there is\nalso agreement for 188Hg. However, the population of the 12+\nisomeric state in 200Po is only half of the calculated value.\nInsufficient knowledge of its level scheme might be the rea-\nson for this discrepancy. Indeed, the data imply the existence\nof another isomer.\nOne can note the large number of 12+ isomers observed in\nthe present experiment, namely, in 188Hg, 192,194,196Pb, and\n198,200Po nuclei. All these states are spherical with ni13\/2\n\u22122 con-\nfiguration, except in 188Hg where the 12+ isomer was alter-\nnatively interpreted as member of an oblate band [47]. The\nrelated structures of these isomeric states are reflected in\ntheir similar w value, as determined for 194,196Pb and\n194,200Po. As we mentioned earlier, w could not be deter-\nmined for 192Pb, but assuming a similar value as for the other\nheavier lead isotopes sw=0.6d, a good agreement with the\ntheory is obtained, namely, rexp \/rth=0.83.\nIt can be inferred that there is good agreement between\nthe calculated and experimental angular momentum popula-\ntions. The experimental value was determined from the iso-\nmeric ratio by taking into account the decay properties of the\nhigher-lying states. Although, an assumption on the angular\nmomentum population was already used when estimating\nthis correction factor, the overall agreement can be consid-\nered as an indication that this presupposition was appropri-\nate. We note that in previous studies no such correction was\napplied [3,4]. Nevertheless in the case of yrast isomers a\nreasonable agreement with the theory was found. However,\nthe absence of suitable data from which to obtain the corre-\nsponding correction factors makes it difficult to explore this\nsurprising feature.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nApproximately 15 previously known isomeric states in\nthe neutron-deficient A<190 region were identified follow-\ning the projectile fragmentation of a 750A MeV 238U beam.\nThe deduced isomeric ratios are smaller than those calculated\nwith the ABRABLA code based on the abrasion-ablation\nmodel of fragmentation including the sharp cutoff approxi-\nmation. Reasonable agreement can be obtained between the\nexperimental and calculated angular-momentum populations\nby correcting the isomeric ratios with a factor which reflects\nthe decay pattern of the states above the isomer. This im-\nproved understanding of the angular-momentum distribu-\ntions in exotic nuclei formed via the projectile fragmentation\ntechnique may be important for future studies with radioac-\ntive beams.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe excellent work of the FRS technical staff and the\naccelerator group at GSI is acknowledged.
