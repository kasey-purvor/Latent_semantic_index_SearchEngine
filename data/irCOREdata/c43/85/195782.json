During the By-negative interval the bursts were di-\nrected westwards in the Northern Hemisphere and eastwards\nin the Southern Hemisphere; during the By-positive interval\ntheir directions were reversed. These two asymmetries be-\ntween the different orientations of IMF By and between the\ntwo hemispheres are key to our understanding of the magne-\ntospheric phenomenon responsible for generating the bursts.\nThey provide further evidence in support of the idea that the\nbursts are a result of reconnection in an asymmetric tail un-\nder the prolonged influence of IMF By .

Ionosphere (Plasma convection; Ionosphere-\nmagnetosphere interactions) \u2013 Magnetospheric Physics\n(Magnetotail)\n1 Introduction\nIt has long been supposed that the major episodes of recon-\nnection and open flux destruction in the tail take place during\nmagnetospheric substorms (Hones, 1979; Baker et al., 1996).\nGeotail observations, for example, have shown that recon-\nCorrespondence to: A. Grocott\n(ag27@ion.le.ac.uk)\nnection typically begins in the dusk sector plasma sheet at\ndown-tail distances of \u223c20\u201330RE a few minutes before the\nonset of expansion phase signatures on the ground, and ex-\npands to encompass a significant fraction of the dusk and\nmidnight sector tail (Nagai et al., 1998; Nagai and Machida,\n1998; Petrukovich et al., 1998; Machida et al., 1999). In the\nionosphere this is manifest as large-scale twin-vortex flows\nwhich are excited in the nightside hemisphere (Cowley and\nLockwood, 1992, and references therein) as newly closed\nflux exits the polar cap and is accelerated back towards the\ndayside. A typical substorm will involve a total flux clo-\nsure of \u223c0.25 GWb, representing approximately 50% of the\namount of open flux present before onset (Milan et al., sub-\nmitted, 20051).\nWhen the interplanetary field points north, it is well es-\ntablished that Dungey-cycle flow and substorm activity are\nreduced (e.g. Fairfield and Cahill, 1966; Reiff et al., 1981).\nAt the same time, high-latitude reconnection between lobe\nfield lines and the IMF begins, exciting additional flow cells,\nparticularly on the dayside (e.g. Dungey, 1963; Russell,\n1972; Reiff and Burch, 1985; Bristow et al., 1998). How-\never, observations in the dayside ionosphere suggest that\nopen flux tube production does not switch off entirely un-\ntil the clock angle falls below \u223c30\u25e6\u201340\u25e6 (e.g. Sandholt et\nal., 1998a, b) such that during intervals of northward, but\nBy-dominated IMF, both open field line (lobe) and closed\nfield line reconnection may be taking place (Nishida et al.,\n1998). On the nightside, the response to a modest but steady\ndayside driving under these conditions is readily observable.\nTaguchi (1992), for example, reported Magsat observations\nof IMF By-controlled field-aligned currents near the mid-\nnight auroral oval. Taguchi et al. (1994) and Taguchi and\nHoffman (1996) went on to associate these currents with\nDE-2 observations of azimuthal plasma convection, which\n1Milan, S. E., Wild, J.

(1998) proposed a unified model of magnetotail convec-\ntion based on Geotail data which elaborates on the model\nproposed by Taguchi et al. (1994) and Taguchi and Hoffman\n(1996) and relates the nightside flows to the concurrent day-\nside reconnection which drives them. Other, more complex\nmodels have also been proposed (e.g. Tanaka, 1999; Watan-\nabe et al., 2004) which consider alternative configurations for\nthe dayside reconnection, and subsequent magnetotail recon-\nnection, that may occur during a wide variety of northward\nIMF clock angles.\nRecently, Senior et al. (2002) and Grocott et al. (2003,\n2004) have reported SuperDARN observations of large-scale\nbursty flows in the nightside ionosphere during extended in-\ntervals of 90\u25e6>IMF clock angle >45\u25e6. These flows have a\nrecurrence time of\u223c1 h, with substructure on tens of minutes\ntime scales. They take the form of surges of azimuthal \u201cre-\nturn\u201d flow in the dawn and dusk convection cells, several de-\ngrees wide in latitude, consistent with the flows observed by\nTaguchi et al. (1994) and Taguchi and Hoffman (1996). No\nevidence of substorm signatures in the tail magnetic field or\nparticle fluxes at geosynchronous distances seem to accom-\npany these bursts, yet evidence in the ionosphere for flux clo-\nsure is apparent at rates of \u223c30\u201350 kV (Grocott et al., 2003;\nMilan et al., 2005; Milan et al., submitted, 20051). Over\nseveral hours these bursts of \u201ctail reconnection during IMF-\nnorthward non-substorm intervals\u201d, or TRINNIs, are there-\nfore clearly capable of closing a significant fraction of a GWb\nof flux. Whilst evidently not as intense as substorms (auroral\nbrightnesses \u223c100 times weaker than in substorm expansion\nphases have been reported by, e.g. Milan et al., submitted,\n20051) TRINNIs are, nevertheless, an extremely important\nphenomenon for flux transport in the tail. However, owing\nto a dearth of observations to date, very little is understood\nabout them and their driving mechanisms.\nOne significant hole in our understanding comes from\na lack of direct interhemispheric observations. Grocott et\nal. (2004), following the work of Nishida et al. (1998) dis-\ncussed above, suggested that the ionospheric signature of a\nTRINNI was caused by the reconfiguration of an asymmet-\nric tail resulting from prolonged dayside reconnection be-\ntween terrestrial field lines and a By-dominated IMF. By the\ntime tail field lines reconnected some distance downtail they\nwould have ionospheric footprints which were significantly\ndisplaced in azimuth in opposite hemispheres. The untwist-\ning of the tail field after reconnection could explain the fast\nazimuthal flows in the ionosphere, only if oppositely directed\nflows were driven in opposite hemispheres. This paper shows\nthat the nature of the bursts in the Southern Hemisphere is\nindeed opposite to that of those in the north, corroborating\nprevious observations as well as the theory mentioned above\n(which is discussed in more detail in Sect. 4). Two intervals\nare presented here, one during which IMF By was negative\n(21\/22 February 2000, hereafter referred to as Interval \u2013) and\none where IMF By was positive (26\/27 April 2000, Inter-\nval +).\n2 Instrumentation\nThe main instrumentation employed in this study is that\nof the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)\n(Greenwald et al., 1995). Data from the twelve HF radars\nwhich comprised the Northern and Southern Hemisphere\ncomponents of the network at the time of the intervals dis-\ncussed in this study have been used to derive large scale\nmaps of the high-latitude convection using the \u201cMap Po-\ntential\u201d model (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998). The line-\nof-sight velocities are mapped onto a polar grid, and used\nto determine a solution for the electrostatic potential which\nis expressed in spherical harmonics up to sixth order. The\nequipotentials of the solution represent the plasma stream-\nlines of the modelled convection pattern. Information from\nA. Grocott et al.: Interhemispheric observations of TRINNIs 1765\nthe statistical model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (1996),\nparameterised by concurrent IMF conditions, is used to sta-\nbilise the solution where no data are available. A Heppner-\nMaynard boundary, determined from the line-of-sight veloc-\nity data, is also used to constrain the convection pattern at\nlower latitudes (Heppner and Maynard, 1987; Shepherd and\nRuohoniemi, 2000). The flow vectors which will be shown\nsuperposed on the electric equipotentials are derived using\nthe SuperDARN line-of-sight velocity measurements with\nthe transverse velocity component provided by the spherical\nharmonic fits.\nIMF conditions for each study interval were measured\nby the MAG instrument (Smith et al., 1999) onboard\nthe ACE spacecraft (Stone et al., 1998). During In-\nterval \u2013 ACE was located upstream at GSM coordinates\n(X,Y,Z)=(239,\u201330,10)RE and during Interval + it was lo-\ncated at (X,Y,Z)=(223,2,\u201321)RE (with negligible move-\nment over each interval). Solar wind data obtained by the\nSWEPAM instrument (McComas et al., 1998) were also used\nto estimate the propagation delay of field changes from ACE\nto the dayside ionosphere using the algorithm of Khan and\nCowley (1999). This was found to be 71\u00b17 min for Inter-\nval \u2013 and 67\u00b15 min for Interval + and has been used to lag\nthe appropriate ACE IMF data displayed here.\n3 Observations\n3.1 Upstream interplanetary conditions\nFigure 1 shows the lagged ACE interplanetary magnetic field\ndata in GSM coordinates from 18:00\u201304:00 UT from both\nInterval \u2013 (dotted lines) and Interval + (solid lines). The scale\nof each panel is the same for both intervals with the range\nfor IMF By doubled to account for the opposite senses. The\nvertical lines indicate the times of SuperDARN flow maps\n(discussed below), again, dotted for Interval \u2013 and solid for\nInterval +. When considering the time axis in this figure it is\nimportant to remember that the data have only been lagged\nto the dayside ionosphere, whereas the flow features we are\ninterested in occur on the nightside (and are understood to be\na result of reconnection in the tail). Since the tail neutral line\nmay be many 100RE downstream (Richardson et al., 1989;\nWatanabe et al., 1998) it will be the IMF conditions from\nsome hours earlier which determined the nature of the tail\ndynamics and data are therefore shown from 4 h prior to the\nintervals of interest.\nDuring both intervals IMF Bx was predominantly nega-\ntive, strongly so (\u223c\u201310 nT) for the first part of Interval \u2013 and\nweakly so (>\u20135 nT) at most other times. IMF By was, by\ndefinition, positive for the most part during Interval + and\nnegative during Interval \u2013. It is worth noting that the mag-\nnitude of IMF By was greater for Interval \u2013 than Interval +\n(as was the magnitude of IMF Bz and the total field). It is\nalso apparent that IMF By dropped to near zero towards the\nend of Interval +, although for reasons discussed above this is\nlikely to have occurred too late on in the interval to be of any\nconsequence. Whilst predominantly positive, IMFBz made a\nbrief negative excursion towards the end of the same interval\n(coincident with a pressure pulse seen in the SWEPAM data\nof \u223c1.3\u20135.4 nPa, not shown) and in this case the change co-\nincided with an enhancement in the nightside flow (see next\nsection). In general, the field remained steadier during Inter-\nval \u2013, with a total field strength of \u223c15 nT and clock angle\nof \u223c\u201345\u25e6. Interval + had a field which, whilst weaker, had a\nsimilar clock angle magnitude to Interval \u2013 for the most part,\nwith some pressure pulse-related variability towards the end.\n3.2 SuperDARN observations of the nightside ionospheric\nflow\nFigure 2 shows four pairs of maps of the nightside high-\nlatitude ionospheric flow observed by the SuperDARN\nradars, with midnight at the bottom and dusk to the left.\nThe numbers on the contours indicate the ionospheric elec-\ntric potentials in kV (discussed in Sect. 2) which are neg-\native at dusk (clockwise flow) and positive at dawn (anti-\nclockwise flow). The total transpolar voltage is also shown\nin the bottom right corner of each panel. The flow vectors\nare colour coded according to the velocity colour bar shown\non the right, with the vector length scale also being indicated\nin the bottom left of each panel. Panels (a\u2013d) are from In-\nterval \u2013 and panels (e\u2013h) are from Interval +. Each pair of\npanels shows the Northern and Southern Hemisphere flows\nfor the times indicated by the vertical lines on Fig. 1. These\ntimes are also displayed at the top of each flow map-pair.\nPanels (a) and (c) then show the Northern Hemisphere\nflows during theBy-negative interval. In each case, the domi-\nnant flow feature is a strong (of order\u223c1000 ms\u22121)westward\nburst in the midnight sector which resembles those bursts dis-\ncussed by Grocott et al. (2003). The burst in panel (a) appears\nto be slightly further round towards dusk, forming part of a\nmore \u201cusual\u201d flow cell. The burst in panel (c), which oc-\ncurred \u223c3 h later forms part of a more distorted dusk flow\ncell which covers much of the polar cap. In both cases, the\nflows out of the polar cap into the nightside auroral zone are\nshifted towards dawn. Panels (e) and (g) show the North-\nern Hemisphere flows during the By-positive interval. In this\ncase, the flows out of the polar cap are shifted towards dusk,\nwith bursts of return flow which have the opposite direction\nto those for By-negative (as found by Grocott et al., 2004),\nand a slightly reduced flow magnitude (\u223c600\u2013800 ms\u22121).\nIt can be seen by examining panels (b), (d), (f) and (h) that\nthe coincident Southern Hemisphere flows similarly take the\nform of high speed bursts. It is also clear that these Southern\nHemisphere counterparts have the opposite east-west flow\nasymmetry, both in the location of the flows out of the polar\ncap, and in the direction of the return flows. In other words,\nnorthern By-positive bursts resemble southern By-negative\nbusts, and vice versa. Again, the bursts during Interval \u2013\n(panels (b) and (d)) are faster than those from Interval + (pan-\nels (f) and (h)). These observations will be discussed further\nin the next section.\n1766 A.

The transpolar voltage is indicated in the bottom right-hand\ncorner of each map and the colour bars indicate the magnitude of the flow vectors.\n4 Discussion\nThe observations presented above are consistent with those\nreported by Grocott et al. (2003, 2004) in showing the\nionospheric signatures of TRINNIs. It is worth noting that\nground magnetometer data and LANL geosynchronous par-\nticle data (not shown) are also consistent, showing no evi-\ndence of substorm activity during the intervals. The present\nobservations are unique, however, in that they also show that\nthese signatures, which have previously been observed in\nthe Northern Hemisphere alone, are also evident in South-\nern Hemisphere data concurrently. They also show that the\nSouthern Hemisphere bursts have the opposite direction to\nthose in the north, corroborating the theory on their origin\nwhich is revisited below.\n4.1 Magnetospheric morphology\nIt now seems clear that these night side IMF By flow phe-\nnomena are related to similar phenomena that occur on the\ndayside in the region of the cusp. There you also see\nBy-dependent east-west flows downstream of the reconnec-\ntion site which are opposite in opposite hemispheres. These\nare associated with newly-opened flux tubes, poleward of the\nopen-closed field line boundary, that are being pulled side-\nways by the field tension force (the Svalgaard-Mansurov ef-\nfect) (Svalgard, 1973). This tension force causes the field\nlines to enter the lobes at the magnetopause on opposite sides\nof the tail in the two hemispheres putting an asymmetry (or\ntwist) into the tail lobes. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, which\nshows a schematic representation of one possible explanation\nA. Grocott et al.: Interhemispheric observations of TRINNIs 1767\nfor \u201cTRINNI\u201d field line topology responsible for producing\nthe flow bursts (based on Nishida et al., 1998). Panel (a)\nshows a view looking down on the Earth\u2019s poles from the\nnorth with noon to the top and dusk to the left. The south-\nern pole is thus viewed as if looking through the Earth. The\nopen-closed field line boundary is shown as a dashed line and\nthe reconnection line is dot-dashed. For positive IMF By ,\nthe black solid arrowed curves show the convection stream-\nlines for the Northern Hemisphere and the grey ones for\nthe Southern Hemisphere (the opposite is true for negative\nIMF By). Tail field lines are represented by the straight\nlines which connect the two hemispheres via the reconnec-\ntion line. When these field lines reconnect they therefore pro-\nduce twisted closed flux tubes like those shown in panel (b).\nThis shows the corresponding view towards the Earth from\nthe tail for the 2 orientations of IMF By . The twisted neutral\nsheet is indicated by the dashed line and the newly recon-\nnected field lines (B) are indicated. The effect we see in the\nionosphere is the untwisting of these closed flux tubes in the\nreturn sunward flow. This is indicated in panels (a) and (b)\nby the thick arrowed curves.\nIt is important to appreciate that the bursts in each hemi-\nsphere are not geomagnetically conjugate. Consider a field\nline, immediately after being closed, with its footprints at\npoints \u201cx\u201d just equatorward of the open-closed field line\nboundary. Its return path to the dayside can be one of two\nways, i.e. via dusk or dawn. If it goes via dusk then (for,\ne.g. the IMF By-positive case) it will form part of a South-\nern Hemisphere flow burst, whereas if it goes via dawn then\nit forms part of a Northern Hemisphere flow burst. Which\nis the case is likely to depend on where the field lines cross\nthe equatorial plane. Roughly, if this is pre- (post-) midnight,\nthe field line will map to the burst in the southern (northern)\nhemisphere, as the field lines contract towards the Earth and\nare diverted via dusk (dawn) around it.\n4.2 Flow burst magnitude\nThe relationship between nightside dynamics and the his-\ntory of prior dayside activity is further illustrated by consid-\nering the magnitude of the flow bursts. Referring back to\nFig. 2, it was noted above that the magnitude of the flow ve-\nlocities during Interval + are of lower magnitude than those\nfor Interval \u2013. It does not appear to be a common feature\nof Bypositive flow bursts to be of lower velocity (Grocott\net al. (2004) reported bursts in excess of 1000 ms\u22121 during\nBy-positive intervals) but may, therefore, be related to dif-\nferences in the IMF driving conditions of the previous few\nhours. Indeed, it was also noted above that the magnitudes\nof IMF By , Bz, and the total field were larger during Inter-\nval \u2013. A higher rate of dayside reconnection which would be\nexpected to occur in the presence of a stronger IMF (Free-\nman et al., 1993) might reasonably be expected to lead to\nmore intense tail driven convection.\n12\n00\n18 06\nIMF BZ > 0, BY > 0\nBB\nZ\nY\nZ\nY\nIMF BZ > 0, BY < 0\na\nb\nFigure 3\nx x\nFig. 3.

Convection return\nflows are shown by arrows (after Nishida et al., 1998; Grocott et al.,\n2004; Milan et al., 2005).\n4.3 Time evolution of the flow bursts\nAn additional point of interest concerns the time evolution of\nthe flows in each hemisphere. This is not at all obvious from\nthe discussion of individual flow maps and so a time series\nof the flows is presented in Fig. 4. The solid curves show the\n1768 A.

The vertical dotted lines are as in\nFig. 1. It is immediately evident that the flows are quite vari-\nable during each interval, with enhancements over the back-\nground level of many 100s ms\u22121. It also appears that not all\npeaks in the flow are actually coincident in both hemispheres.\nIn some cases, e.g. at \u223c23:00 UT in Interval +, an enhance-\nment in the Northern Hemisphere flows seems to proceed one\nin the Southern Hemisphere by \u223c20 min. This seems to be\nsupporting the idea discussed in Sect. 4.1 concerning the lack\nof geomagnetic conjugacy between the northern and south-\nern bursts. Since different field lines are mapping to bursts\nin each hemisphere there is no constraint on the bursts being\nsimultaneous.\nWhilst it is clear that IMF By controls the asymmetry\nin the direction of the northern and southern bursts, it is\nnot so obvious what controls the asymmetry in the tim-\ning. It is interesting to note the large negative IMF Bx\npresent, in particular in Interval +, which could play a role\nhere. Interhemispheric asymmetries in lobe reconnection,\nfor example, are believed to be due, in part, to IMF Bx(e.g.\nLockwood and Moen, 1999) since reconnection in one lobe\ncan occur between the IMF and pre-existing open flux. Mod-\nerate IMF Bx effects have also been observed in relation to,\nfor example, the location of the polar cap and cusp (Cow-\nley et al., 1991). Although the reconnection of closed flux\nwith the IMF (as is believed to be occurring here) obviously\nproduces the same amount of open flux in both hemispheres\nirrespective of the location on the magnetopause at which it\nis occurring, the consequent field line geometry imparted on\nthe two tail lobes may well be different. Any north-south\nasymmetry in the prior dayside reconnection could therefore\nbe responsible for the asymmetry in subsequent tail recon-\nnection. A study of the interhemispheric statistics of these\nflow bursts and their associated IMF conditions (currently in\nprogress) will hopefully reveal more about their generation\nmechanism.\n4.4 Radar data coverage\nThe issue of radar data coverage is perhaps worth comment-\ning on in more detail, specifically regarding its limited na-\nture and time-variability. Although coverage is limited, for\nthe most part it is relatively consistent. Whilst we might not,\ntherefore, want to rely too heavily on the global convection\npattern implied by the Map Potential model, we can be confi-\ndent that the localised flow signatures indicated by the radar\ndata are real for two reasons. Firstly the statistical model\nof Ruohoniemi and Greenwald (1996), used in the Map Po-\ntential fitting process, contains no information regarding the\nTRINNI related flow bursts. Any evidence of them must,\ntherefore, be coming from the radar data itself. Secondly,\nthere is rarely any correlation between variations in the flow\nspeed and the number of radar data points. This suggests that\nthe variations are real and not just a result of fluctuating data\ncoverage. There is one exception to this, which can be seen at\nthe time of the second vertical line in Fig. 4, Interval +. Here\nwe see an enhancement to the flows in both hemispheres co-\nincident with an enhancement in the amount of radar data.\nThis enhancement also coincided with a brief negative ex-\ncursion in IMF Bz (as mentioned above) and the start of\na substorm growth phase (evinced in ground magnetometer\nand LANL geosynchronous spacecraft data, not shown). It is\npossible, therefore, that these changes in geophysical activ-\nity may have had some bearing on the nature of the nightside\nflows, although it is unlikely that they would have signifi-\ncantly altered the magnetotail dynamics over such a short\ntimescale. The sudden change in interplanetary conditions\nmay, however, have provided a trigger for this enhancement,\nas suggested above. In any case, these concerns should be\nthe subject of future work, and do not affect the overall con-\nclusions of the present study.\nFinally, the possibility does exist that the location of the\ndata coverage could change, such that flows appear to come\nand go even though the overall amount of data remained con-\nstant. The likelihood of this is small, however, for a number\nA. Grocott et al.: Interhemispheric observations of TRINNIs 1769\nof reasons. Firstly, the occurrence of radar scatter is not ran-\ndom, but is naturally related to the ionospheric conditions\nat the time. Where data does disappear, it may be the case\nthat this is a result of a physical change with respect to the\nmechanism which is driving the flows. In effect, therefore,\nan absence of scatter could simply be indicative of an ab-\nsence of activity. This is not strictly true, of course, since\npropagation effects could also cause the scatter to disappear,\nalthough this itself can be ruled out if scatter at further ranges\nis still present. Nevertheless, the time-series curve plotted in\nFig. 4 is only drawn where there are at least two data points\npresent. A complete disappearance of data coverage will not,\ntherefore, be interpreted as a real variation in the flow. Lastly,\nand perhaps most basically, an inspection of the flow maps\nfor the whole of each interval studied suggests that there is\nindeed relatively good consistency in the location of the data\nthroughout.\n5 Summary\nThis paper has shown the first interhemispheric radar obser-\nvations interpreted as the ionospheric response to tail recon-\nnection during IMF-northward non-substorm intervals. It is\nfound that the bursts of flow which have been previously ob-\nserved in the Northern Hemisphere are also apparent in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. The simultaneous flows have the op-\nposite east-west direction in each hemisphere, supporting the\ntheory discussed above on the bursts\u2019 origin. A more de-\ntailed look at the nature of the flows suggests that whilst the\nlonger-timescale effects of the TRINNIs are apparent in both\nhemispheres, there is some variability in the flow which is\nnot simultaneous. A statistical study currently in progress\nshould elucidate this matter further, as well as providing the\nmeans to categorise the TRINNI phenomenon in terms of the\ngoverning IMF conditions and the amount of flux closure in-\nvolved.\nAcknowledgements.
