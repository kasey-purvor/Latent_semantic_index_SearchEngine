Introduction \nOver the past two decades, the concept of partition of unity (PU) approximations has \nbeen established and developed into different types of PU-based methods for solid \nmechanics including the Partition of Unity method [1-2], hp clouds [3], the generalized \nfinite element method [4], the octree partition of unity method (OctPUM) [5] and others \n[6-9]. PUFEMs have attracted much interest from researchers in computational solid \nmechanics as they offer several advantages over the conventional finite element method \n(FEM), such as a free choice of local approximation functions, which allows flexibility \nfor modelling complicated problems, and the construction of high order approximations \nwithout the addition of extra nodes. This feature is particularly advantageous for \nmodelling problems with moving boundaries (crack propagation for example) since the \nmesh does not have to be changed as the material interface is moving, unlike in the \nFEM where the mesh has to be updated to conform to the evolving geometry at each \ntime step.  \nA partition of unity is a set of functions ( ){ }iN x  that, for every point in the \ndomain under consideration, sum to 1, i.e.  ( ) 1i\ni\nN x \u2261\u0001 . For a field variable, the PU-\nbased approximation is constructed as  \n( )( ) ( )h li i\ni\nu x N x u x=\u0001  \nwhere ( )liu x  is the local approximation defined on the \u201ccover\u201d of node i where the \ncover is a small region defined around i. In the standard PUFEM, the FE shape \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n3 \nfunctions are used as the PU functions and the local approximation is constructed by \npolynomials. \nStandard PUFEMs face some problems that hinder their use for practical application \nin solid mechanics problems such as the linear dependence (LD) problem [10], which \narises in the formulation of the global stiffness matrix, and the difficulties in imposing \nessential boundary conditions directly. Efforts have been made to address these \nproblems by various means in the past. In order to deal with essential boundary \nconditions, several methods such as the Lagrange multiplier method, the penalty \nmethod, Nitsche\u2019s method, blending of meshfree methods with finite elements, and the \n\u201calmost everywhere PU\u201d method have been suggested in [11-13]. In [14, 15], PU \nfunctions with flat-tops were adopted to avoid the linear dependence problems.  In [16], \nthe LD problem is investigated and numerical tests described to compare the severity of \nthe LD problem in various PUFEMs. Though some measures are suggested to alleviate \nthe problem, such as suppressing the higher-order degrees of freedom (DOF) and \nadjustment of the element geometry, they cannot ensure the removal of the LD problem \nand are also difficult to implement robustly in practice. For example, changing the \ngeometry for a quadrilateral element means an iterative checking, modifying and re-\nchecking process for all existing elements. This sequential and interdependent process is \nnot always time-bounded. A novel mixed-cell-complex partition of unity method \n(MCCPUM) is proposed to eliminate the LD problem in [17] which is based on \noverlapping polyhedral covers generated from Voronoi cells. However, the algorithms \nneeded to generate the mixed-cell-complex are rather complicated and computationally \nexpensive, and the imposition of the essential boundary conditions cannot be done \ndirectly. A PU-based hybrid FE-meshfree four-noded quadrilateral element is proposed \nin [18] which successfully eliminates the LD problem and the interpolation possesses \nthe desirable delta property. The same local approximation scheme is used later to \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n4 \ndevelop a 3D eight-noded element in [19]. For both these elements, however, the \ncomputational cost of forming the shape functions is significantly increased compared \nwith a standard PUFEM because a least squares (LS) process is required over the covers \nof all nodes. The LS process, which involves matrix inversion, is computationally \nexpensive and also requires a transitional region between nodes employing different \nbasis functions. Therefore, an important advantage of the PUFEMs, the free choice of \nbasis function from node to node, is lost. \nBased on the above investigations, a new PU finite element (a three-noded triangle) \nis here developed which overcomes the drawbacks cited above satisfactorily. In this \nnew element, the simplest conventional FE shape functions are used as the PU function. \nThe essential idea of the method is to construct the local approximation by dealing with \nnodes on the essential boundaries and all the other nodes separately. The local \napproximation at a boundary node is constructed by a modified LS approach and that at \nan inner node using a polynomial basis. These dually constructed local approximations \nare then incorporated into the PU function to obtain the shape functions over each \nelement. This PU-based element is free from the LD problem as will be demonstrated \nlater using eigenvalue analysis. As with one of the previous elements a LS process is \nneeded but only for nodes at which essential boundary conditions are to be applied, \nwhich for most problems is a small proportion of the total nodes, thus the computational \ncost of shape function is significantly reduced compared with the quadrilateral element \ndescribed in [18].  \n2. Formulation of a new PU-based, three-noded triangular finite element \nIn this section, the interpolation schemes used in the new element are described in \ndetail.  We start the description of the formulation using a 2D problem domain of \narbitrary shape as shown in Figure 1. The formulation is described for an element in \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n5 \nelastostatics, with the fundamental field variable being displacement. For an arbitrary \nnode i, its displacement vector in 2D is ( )0 0,i iu v , where  0iu  and  0iv  are the \ndisplacements in the x and y directions respectively. (The following formulation is \nderived only for 0iu in the x direction but an identical process can be used for 0iv  in the \ny direction). A triangular mesh is used to discretise the domain. Within each element, \ndenoted as e, the displacement in the x direction is expressed as  \n( ) ( ) e\ni\nl\niiuNu Nuxx ==\u0001\n=\n3\n1\n,         (1) \nwhere [ ]321 NNN=N  is a matrix of shape functions as for a conventional three-\nnoded (i = 1 ... 3) triangular finite element. The vector eu  is not a nodal displacement \nvector as in the FEM but a vector of nodal displacement functions defined on the cover \nof each node, i.e.  ( ) ( ) ( ){ }T321 xxxu llle uuu=  where the superscript l indicates the local \nnature of the functions.  \nFigure 1 \nThe cover of a node is the area where a node exerts influence on the field variable \nand is defined as the region around a node consisting of all the elements that share that \nnode. In Figure 1, for example, the cover of node i is Ci, the union of the six triangles \nconnected to node i. For a node lying on the boundary, node j in Figure 1 for example, \nthe cover is Cj, which is slightly different from Ci. The nodes connected to node j are \nfound as cover nodes shown as the double circle nodes in Figure 1 and Cj. is the union of \nall the elements connected to these cover nodes\n.\n Assume that the displacement over the \ncover Ci is given by \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\u0001\n=\n==\nm\nk\nkik\nl\ni apu\n1\nT xxaxpx        (2) \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n6 \nwhere ( ) [ ]\u0001,,,,1T xyyx=xp is a polynomial basis, m  is the number of monomials in \nthe basis, and ka  are the corresponding coefficients to each monomial in the basis.  \nIn the development of the element that follows we use a bilinear basis throughout \n( ) [ ]T 1, , ,x y xy=p x . We do this to show that the basis chosen does not have to be the \nsame as the PU basis. \n2.1 Local approximation at an interior node \nIf a node is not lying on the boundary, the local function over cover Ci takes the \nfollowing form \n( ) xyayaxaau iiiilni 4321 +++=x .       (3) \nHere i is the node index, a1i to a4i are the corresponding coefficients to be determined \nand the superscript n indicates an interior node. Enforcing ( )xlniu  to be equal to the \nnodal value at node i gives  \n( ) 04321, iiiiiiiiiiilni uyxayaxaayxu =+++=       (4) \nand therefore \niiiiiiiii yxayaxaua 43201 \u2212\u2212\u2212= .       (5) \nSubstituting Eqn 5 into Eqn 3 gives \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ixiiiiiiiiilni yxxyayyaxxauu T\u0001x =\u2212+\u2212+\u2212+= 4320    (6) \nwhere  \n[ ] [ ]iiiiiiiii yxxyyyxx \u2212\u2212\u2212== 14321 \u03c8\u03c8\u03c8\u03c8\u0001 ,    (7a) \n[ ]T4320 iiiiix aaau=T .        (7b) \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n7 \nIn the above 0iu  is the displacement of node i in the x direction and ( )iii aaa 432 ,,  are the \nextra unknowns to be determined over the nodal cover iC . It can be seen from Eqn 6 \nthat  \n( ) ., 0iiilni uyxu =          (8) \nThus the local function ( )xlniu  is interpolatory.  \n2.2 Local approximation at a node on an essential boundary \nNow we consider node j in Figure 1, for example, which is on the essential boundary. \nThe local function over Cj is also approximated by the same polynomial basis as above. \nSupposing there are M nodes in Cj, the cover of the node j, we can then define a residual \nJ as \n( )\n2\n1 1\n0\u0001 \u0001\n= =\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u0007\n\u2212=\nM\nj\nm\nk\nkkj apuJ x         (9) \nwhich collects the error between the local approximation at the nodes in the cover and  \nthe nodal parameters as unknowns. Minimizing J with a standard least squares process \ngives \nj\n0\n1BUAa \u2212= ,          (10) \nwhere  \n1 2T\n1 2\n1 1 2 2\n1 1 1\nM\nM\nM M\nx x x\ny y y\nx y x y x y\n\u0007 \u0004\n\u0005 \u0002\n\u0005 \u0002\n= =\n\u0005 \u0002\n\u0005 \u0002\n\u0006 \u0003\nB P\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n ,      (11a) \nPPA T= ,          (11b) \nand \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n8 \n[ ]0 10 20 0 Tj Mu u u=U \u0001         (12) \nis a vector of nodal displacements for nodes in Cj. Substituting Eqn 10 into Eqn 2 gives \n( ) ( ) jjlbju 0Ux\u0002x = ,         (13) \nwhere the superscript b indicates a node on the essential boundary and  \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]xxxBAxpx\u0002 jMjjj \u03d5\u03d5\u03d5 ,,, 211T \u0001== \u2212 .     (14) \nNow we modify Eqn 13 into the following form  \n( ) ( ) jjlbju 0Ux\u0002x = ,         (15) \nwhere \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]xxxx\u0002 jMjjj \u03d5\u03d5\u03d5 ,,, 21 \u0001=        (16) \nin which  \n( ) ( ) ( )\n( ) ( ) ( ) .1 ji\nji\nj\nj\ni\nj\ni\nj\ni\nj\nj\ni\nj\ni\nj\ni\n=+\u2212=\n\u2260\u2212=\nxxx\nxxx\n\u03d5\u03d5\u03d5\n\u03d5\u03d5\u03d5\n       (17) \n( )x\u0002 j  can be seen as being a matrix of modified shape function values. By inspection, \nthese shape functions possess the delta property, i.e. ( ) 1=jjj x\u03d5 , ( ) ( )ijjji \u2260= 0x\u03d5 , and  \nsatisfy the partition of unity requirement that ( ) 1\n1\n=\u0001\n=\nM\nk\nj\nk x\u03d5 .  Therefore, ( )xlbju  is \ninterpolatory and boundary conditions can be applied as in the conventional FEM. It \nshould be pointed out that the formulation derived here for is concerned with the \nprescribed value in a certain degree of freedom, which can be either in u or v or both for \na node on essential boundary. However, for generality in programming, we can apply \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n9 \nEqn (13) to all degrees of freedom of a node and this will not entail much extra \ncomputational cost. \n3 Properties \nThe displacement of any point x  within an element is computed by substituting Eqns 6 \nand 15 into Eqn 1 to obtain \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\u0001\u0001\u0001\n===\n+==\n21\n11\n3\n1\nn\nj\nlb\njj\nn\ni\nln\nii\ni\nl\nii uNuNuNu xxxx      (18) \nwhere n1 is the number of the nodes in the element not on an  essential boundary while \n2n  is the remaining number of nodes (which will be on an essential boundary). It should \nbe noted that the unknowns at nodes on essential boundaries are the components of the \nvector ( )00 , jj vu , while for the rest of the nodes the unknowns are the components of the \nvector { }Tiiiiiiii bababavu 44332200 ,,,,,,,  where ( )iiiiii bababa 443322 ,,,,,  are extra \nunknowns which appear in the PU functions. From Eqn 18 it can be seen that the \npresent interpolation keeps the number of unknowns the same as the displacement \ndegrees of freedom on the essential boundaries. This feature enables the imposition of \nessential boundary conditions as straightforwardly as in the FEM. The present \ninterpolation also preserves the order of completeness up to the order of basis function \nas will be proved below. Whilst a least squares procedure is needed, which is \ncomputationally expensive, it is required only over the cover of nodes which are located \non the essential boundaries, which in most situations will be a small subset of the total \nnumber of nodes, thus limiting the extra computational time. Though a triangular FE \nmesh is used in the present formulations, the essential idea of dually constructed local \napproximations shown by Eqn 18 may be employed in other types of mesh and even \nmeshless interpolations as in [20-21]. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n10 \nTo make the implementation clearer, we rewrite Eqn 18 into the standard FEM form. \nIf R is the total number of nodes in the nodal cover, which is the union of the nodes in \nEqns 6 and 15, then Eqn 18 becomes \n( ) \u0001\n=\n=\nR\nk\nkk\nh\nu\n1\nUNx          (19) \nwhere kN  is the vector of shape functions for the new PU-based element, and kU  is the \nvector of nodal cover freedoms of corresponding nodes. It is clear that \n( ) 0iilni uu =x , ( ) 0iilbi uu =x , and ( ) ikikN \u03b4=x , thus the interpolation has the delta property \nfor all three nodes of the triangular element, i.e. \n( ) ( )3,2,1,0 == iuu iix .         (20) \nA question now is whether this new type of element is complete or not. In the \nfollowing, we show the present interpolation preserves the completeness of the field up \nto the order of the basis. \nProposition: If the displacement of the nodes belonging to the cover of a boundary node \ni is governed by an arbitrary function f(x), then f(x) can be exactly reproduced by Eqn \n15, that ui(x) = uh(x).  \nProof.  Suppose that the field over the cover of a node conforms to a given function, \ntake the bilinear polynomial as an example \n( ) 1 2 3 4,u x y b b x b y b xy= + + +\u0002 .

(22) \nIt is proved in [22] that any functions appearing in the basis function can be exactly \nreproduced so that the first term on the r.h.s. of Eqn 22 becomes \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n11 \n( ) ( ) ( )\n1\nM\nj\ni i\ni\nu u\u03c6\n=\n\u2261\u0001 x x x\u0002 \u0002         (23) \nand the second term becomes \n( ) ( ) ( )\n1\nM\nj\ni j i j\ni\nu u\u03c6\n=\n\u2261\u0001 x x x\u0002 \u0002 .        (24) \nSubstituting Eqns 23 and 24 into Eqn 22 gives \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )xxxxx uuuuu jjlbj ~~ ~~ =+\u2212=        (25) \nIn [2], it is shown that the consistency order of the global discretisation based on a PU \nconcept is the same as the consistency order of the local approximations. Hence the \npresent interpolation in Eqn 22 is capable of exactly reproducing any function contained \nin the basis of ( )xp  in Eqn 2.  \nWith the interpolation defined, then the problem domain can be discretised using a \nweak form, e.g. a Galerkin procedure, and the rest of the implementation is almost \nidentical to the conventional FEM.  \nIt should be noted that when implementing the present method, the size of the matrix \nlinking displacements to strains (the B matrix) can vary between elements. For example, \nthe element e1 in Figure 1 has two nodes on essential boundary and one interior node, \nand therefore has total degrees of freedom, 2+2+6 = 10 and its B matrix is 2\u00d710; \nelement e2 has only one node on essential boundary, so its B matrix is 2\u00d714; none of the \nthree nodes of element e3 are on essential boundaries, thus the size of its B matrix is \n2\u00d718. The changing size of strain matrix results in a variable size of element stiffness \nmatrix indicating some extra care is necessary in global assembly.  \n4. Testing \nThe element formulation presented above has been coded into an existing FE program \nwritten in C++. In this section, we first verify that the formulation does not suffer from \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n12 \nthe LD problem. Secondly we show the performance of the element on a range of test \nproblems.  \n4.1 Checking the linear dependence problem \nAs highlighted above, a major drawback in some previous PUFEM formulations is the \nLD problem. To check if the LD problem affects the formulation described here we \nadopt the testing procedure given in [16] which is briefly described here. Firstly, an \neigenvalue analysis is carried out for the global stiffness matrix of the complete domain \nwithout imposition of essential boundary conditions in order to record the number of \nzero eigenvalues. Secondly, the minimum essential boundary conditions to prevent rigid \nbody movement are applied. The eigenvalue analysis is repeated to check zero \neigenvalues again. If there are no zero eigenvalues, then the method is free of the LD \nproblem.   \nFigure 2 \nTable 1 \nThe meshes and minimum essential boundary conditions used to check the LD problem \nare shown in Figure 2, which contain a variety of element shapes and layouts and a \nlinear basis is used for all meshes. The elastic material parameters used are 0.1=E  \nand 250.=\u03bd  and plane strain conditions are assumed. The results using these \nparameters are listed in Table 1 and clearly show that there is no zero eigenvalue for all \nthe meshes used thus indicating the LD problem is not present with this formulation. \nThe reasons why the present formulation removes the LD problem in the PUFEM is \nprobably because it improves the way the essential boundary conditions are applied. \nThe physical implications behind a singular global stiffness matrix is insufficient \nconstraint applied to prevent rigid body movement. In a standard PUFEM extra nodal \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n13 \nunknowns appear at the essential boundaries which do not correspond to the real \ndisplacements of those nodes, and their presence leads to zero eigenvalues. The present \nformulation exactly applies the essential boundary conditions and hence also the \nnecessary constraints.  \n4.2 Testing problems \nHere we compare the new element formulation with the standard FEM and with the \nElement Free Galerkin Method (EFGM) using, for the latter, the same type of weight \nfunctions and parameters as in [23]. To study the convergence behaviour we define the \nfollowing error norms in displacement and energy respectively \n( )1T 2\n \u0001\n \u0001 ,    d= \u22c5\bu u u         (26) \nwhere u is a vector collecting nodal displacement results { }1 1 2 2 = , , , , Tn nu v u v u vu \u0001 and \n( )1T 2\n \u0001\n \u0001d= \u22c5\b\u0003 \u0003 \u0004           (27) \nwhere \u0003 is the infinitesimal strain tensor and\u0004  is the Cauchy stress tensor. The relative \ndisplacement error and energy error are given by \nnum exact\nexactu\nr\n\u2212\n=\nu u\nu\n                                   (28) \nand \nnum exact\nexacte\nr\n\u2212\n=\n\u0003 \u0003\n\u0003\n          (29) \nwhere the superscripts num and exact refer to numerical solutions and exact (or \nreference) solutions respectively. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n14 \nA cantilever beam \nA cantilever beam problem with dimensions of l = 8 m and d = 1m, as shown in Figure \n3 is tested first. The beam is subjected to a unit concentrated load p at the right-hand \nend and is constrained at the left-hand end as shown in the Figure 3. The elastic material \nproperties used are PaE 5101\u00d7=  and 25.0=\u03bd   and the problem is solved under a plane \nstrain assumption. We refer to the analytical solution of the problem given in [23] (Note \nthat this problem is not the same as the Timoshenko\u2019s cantilever beam problem, often \nemployed for a similar purpose [27]). Four meshes are used where the numbers of nodes \nare 50, 138, 486 and 965. The basis function is varied between linear and quadratic. \nFigures 4 and 5 show the reduction in both error norms as the mesh for this problem is \nrefined. Figures 6 and 7 show the vertical displacement v and \u0001xx for each mesh \nindicating accuracy of results using the proposed formulation. \n \nFigure 3 \nFigure 4 \nFigure 5 \nFigure 6 \nFigure 7 \n \nCook\u2019s skew beam \nThe second example is Cook\u2019s skew beam [24]. The dimensions and boundary \nconditions used are shown in Figure 8. The beam is subjected to distributed shear force \n16\/1F =  at the right end. The problem is solved under plane stress conditions and \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n15 \nelastic material properties are 0.1=E and 3\/1=\u03bd . Two meshes of different refinements \nare used as shown in Figure 9.  The vertical displacement at point C (vc), the minimum \nprincipal stress at point B ( Bmin\u03c3 ) and the maximum principal stress at point A ( Amax\u03c3 ) \nare compared in Table 2, between the results using the present method and the reference \nresults in [25]. The results show that the proposed method again performs highly \nsatisfactorily for this problem using a linear or a quadratic basis. The errors reduce with \na higher order basis function or greater refinement, as with the conventional FEM.  \nFigure 8 \nFigure 9 \nTable 2 \nAn infinite plate with a circular hole \nThe third example is an infinite plate with a circular hole of radius a = 1 m. The plate is \nsubjected to a far field traction Pa1=\u03c3  in the x direction.  A finite portion of the plate \nis considered for analysis and, due to the symmetry of the problem, only a quarter of the \nportion requires modelling, as shown in Figure 10.  The elastic material properties used \nare PaE 71003 \u00d7= .  and 3.0=\u03bd  and plane stress conditions are assumed.

Boundary conditions specified in [26] are applied on the \nright and upper edges as shown in Figure 10.  The performance of the proposed element \nformulation is studied using meshes with 53, 188, 564 and 1012 nodes as shown in \nFigure 11 and a linear basis is used for all meshes. Figures 12 and 13 show the \nconvergence of the discretised problem towards the analytical solution using the error \nnorms stated above. The proposed method once again shows good convergence \ncharacteristics in this problem involving stress concentration.  Figure 14 shows \u0001xx \npredicted along the left edge x = 0 showing comparable accuracy and smoothness as the \nEFGM, and close agreement with the analytical solution. \nFigure 10 \nFigure 11 \nFigure 12 \nFigure 13 \nFigure 14 \n \n5. Conclusions \nIn this paper we propose a new partition of unity based, three-noded triangular finite \nelement which successfully eliminates the linear dependence problem and removes the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n17 \ncomplexity in application of essential boundary conditions, both met in previous \nPUFEM formulations. By utilizing the inherent flexibility to construct local \napproximations, we have proposed a dual local approximation scheme by treating nodes \non essential boundaries separately to nodes elsewhere which delivers both the delta \nproperty of conventional FEs and which also avoids the linear dependence problem (as \ndemonstrated through eigenvalue analysis). While a least-squares procedure is required \nthis is limited to a few nodes in a typical domain so should not be a major \ncomputational cost of this method. A major advantage of PUFEMs is maintained here, \nthat the local approximation can be varied across a domain. The proposed method is \nonly discussed here for linear elastostatic problems. However, the potential of the \nPUFEM elements such as these will only be fully realised when applied to problems of \nchanging geometry, such as those including finite deformation, elastoplasticity and \nthree-dimensional cracking problem. These are areas in which we are continuing to \ndevelop this class of PU based elements. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of National Natural Science of China, \nNSFC (10972161).
