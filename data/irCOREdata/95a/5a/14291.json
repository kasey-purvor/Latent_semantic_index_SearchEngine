This paper\nsummarizes some studies that cast light on how representations of practice may be\ncaptured for use in an AMC environment.\nIntroduction\nThis paper arises from a programme of research and postgraduate teaching which, over the\nlast ten years, has sought to explore ways of providing better support for the continuing\nprofessional development of geographically dispersed communities of skilled workers\nthrough the use of computer-mediated communications (Goodyear, 1995). One issue is the\nproblem of creating sustained on-line interactions that draw on both practitioner\nexperience and research-based knowledge. Part of our explanation for the difficulties in\nstimulating a sustained and inclusive discussion, which bridges between academia and\npractice, lies in the affordances of text-based communication. Aspects of practice, we\nsuggest, are difficult to render through written language. It can also be very hard to\narticulate practical knowledge that is held and used in tacit form. The situation is\nexacerbated by some of the expectations which participants bring to the electronic\ndiscussion. For example, one can begin to create a comprehensible description of a current\n16\nALT-J ... Volume 6 Number 3\nwork issue through writing an extended account of the .necessary organizational\nbackground - tasks, personnel, 'house-style', etc. - but such extended contributions are\nneither expected nor welcome in most on-line communications'environments. In the rest of\nthis paper, we look at some of the ways in which multimedia communications (using video,,\nvoice, etc.) may be able to help with this block.\nTechnology for professional development within a distributed\ncommunity of practice -\u2022'\nTable 1 is an attempt to summarize some of the strengths and weaknesses of synchronous,\nasynchronous, text-based and multimedia communications. The table brings home the\npoint that there is a very uneven understanding of the four areas. Much more is known\nabout synchronous text-based communication (e.g. McConnell, 1994) than about syn-\nchronous multimedia communication, and very little indeed is known about either\nasynchronous text-based or asynchronous multimedia communication (though see\nMurphy and Collins, 1997; Collis'and Smith, 1997). It is important to recognize that the\n'strengths and weaknesses' in the table have to be interpreted as things which can be\nclaimed 'in principle'. They will not always prove to be characteristics of these types of\ncommunication, since other factors intervene between media type and outcome.\nBearing in mind such caveats, our focus on asynchronous multimedia communication\nbrings the following potential strengths and weaknesses into the foreground. AMC could\nbe said to combine richness of communication and the possibility of quickly creating vivid\naccounts and demonstrations of practice with flexibility in the use of time (participants do\nnot have to be available at the same instant; there is opportunity for reflection on what is\nseen and heard). But AMC is also likely to create materials that are relatively hard to index\nand search, and are relatively demanding in terms of computer memory,: bandwidth and\nstorage space, relative that is to text-based materials. Finally, the price of temporal\nflexibility is that asynchronous communication cannot benefit from the rapid turn-taking\nand negotiation which is characteristic of, and highly valued in, synchronous communica-\ntion (Boden and Molotch, 1994).\nMethodology: researching the requirements for learning\ntechnologies\nWe have adopted a research framework that is becoming known as 'the ergonomics of\nlearning environments' (see e.g. Goodyear, 1997; in press). The essence of the approach is\nthat we:\n\u2022 Distinguish between learning tasks and.learning activities, (tasks are what teachers set;\nactivities are what learners actually do).\n\u2022 Use the best pedagogical resources at our. disposal to design good tasks.\n\u2022 But design technology around a thoroughUnderstanding of activity.\nWhat we are doing is no more than applying lessons learned from mainstream ergonomics,\nHCIand software engineering to the world of educational technology. That is, one should\nbuild technology around real user needs rather than around an idealized 'manager's', view\nof what is needed. The approach is appropriate wherever one cannot assume that learners\nPeter Goodyear and Christine Steeples Creating shareable representations of practice\nText-based\nMulti-media\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\nSynchronous\ne.g. IRC\n(Internet\nRelay Chat)\ne.g. live\nvideo-\nconference\nsupports\ninteractive\ncommunic-\nation; timely;\nsense of event\n& audience\ninflexible use\nof time; may\nnot scale up\nto large\nnumbers\nAsynchronous\ne.g. email, CMC\ne.g. video-on-\ndemand; video-\nmail\ntime to reflect;\nflexible use of\ntime\ncan be slow or\ncumbersome\nStrengths\nencourages\nclarity of\nexpression,\nformalization\nof knowledge\netc.; indexable,\nsearchable;\nsmall data files\nMMil.mh,\nallowt\nt i l l W Hip'il<>\nwell at\ntellinj:1. can b\u00bf\n<MS\\ and quick.\nto piodui_e and\n'read'\nWeaknesses\ntime-consuming\nto produce; hard\nto capture\n'practices'; hard\nto eradicate or\ncontrol\nambiguity?\nhaul to index &\ntench, large\ndala liles\nTable k'ln principle'strengths and weaknesses of synchronous and asynchronous multimedia and\ntext-based communications.\nare highly compliant (i.e. it should suit most areas of Higher Education better than it suits\nmilitary training, for example).\nThe focus, with this approach, shifts to illuminating what learners actually do, once they\nhave entered into a programme of learning activity of some kind. In our case, the\nprogramme of activity is one of continuing professional development in which the 'high\nlevel pedagogy' prioritizes the sharing of vocational experience, the collective analysis,\ndiscussion, critique and improvement of situated working practices, the articulation and\nexamination of tacit knowledge, etc. We need to understand how the members of a\ndistributed community of practice engage in such activity, and how their existing\n18\nALT-] Volume 6 Number 3\ntechnology shapes and limits what they do, so that we can understand how to improve the\ntechnology at their disposal. This has much in common with user-centred, participative or\nethnographic approaches to software\/information systems engineering (see e.g. Norman\nand Draper, 1986; Sch\u00fcler and Namioka, 1993; Shapiro, 1994).\nIn this paper, we report on one small but important area of interaction between technology\nand learner activity. We concentrate on some of the activities associated with creating a\nmultimedia representation of practice, using two approaches, which we have dubbed 'fly on\nthe wall' and 'action with commentary'. We use some example multimedia objects as our\ndata (cf. Boden, 1994, 216ff; Simco and Warin, 1997) and build a conceptual model of those\nobjects as a way of simplifying and ordering the space of possibilities within which AMC-\nbased continuing professional development might occur. It is important to emphasize that\nthis conceptual model is grounded in the data and in our experience of interrogating that\ndata. It is not an a-priori model of the kind that arises from so-called rational analysis.\nThe making of shareable representations of practice as 'raw'\nvideoclips and videoclips of action with commentary\nOur method of working has been adopted as a way of understanding some of the\nrequirements for a properly functioning AMC environment which is to be used in a CPD\nsetting of the kind we characterized earlier. Understanding requirements for a future\ntechnology involves creating a map of likely uses and analysing these uses in some detail.\nMapping the space of likely uses can be helped by observing and reflecting on the\norigination of videoclips of different kinds, trying to identify the attributes which make\none 'kind' of clip different (in important ways) from another, and trying to relate kinds of\nclip to processes of origination.\nWe concentrate here on two kinds of clip. But we also locate these within a broader\ntaxonomy of clips. The kinds of clip with which we are concerned here are:\n\u2022 clips which are, in some sense, 'raw' representations of practice: clips generated by\ntechniques which TV documentary makers call 'fly on the wall', because the camera -\nand the fact that a representation is being created - are meant to have no significant\ndisruptive effect on the practice;\n\u2022 clips which we call 'action with commentary': clips in which the practitioner adds a\nvoice track to a video representation of an unfolding practice, as a way of making that\npractice more comprehensible to others.\nThe data\nThe clips we have been using can be viewed at our project website (the URL is given at the\nend of the paper). Each of the clips can be considered as data from the research. The\nreader may find it useful to look at the clips while reading this article. Additional data\ncome from our observations of the clips being made and from statements by those making\nthe clips (before and after the event). With each clip, members of the research team\ndiscussed a number of aspects of the origination of the clip, tried to define some of its key\nattributes and tried to use this discussion in an iterative construction of a 'space' of kinds\nof clips. The process is not unlike the construction of analytic categories through\n19\nPeter Goodyear and Christine Steeples Creating shareable representations of practice\nsuccessive passes through a data set: building theoretical constructs that are grounded in\nqualitative data (cf. Glaser and Strauss, 1967).\nAnalysis I :Types of video representations of practice\nIn the first part of the analysis, we offer a sketch of six emergent 'kinds' of video\nrepresentation of practice. These can be arranged along a continuum of increasing\nabstraction from actuality. In the following descriptions we use the term 'subject' to denote\npractitioner.\n1. Fly on the wall\nIn this type of representation, a camera is set up to capture practice in situ. The practice\nunfolds with as little attention to the video capture as possible. Depending upon the nature\nof the practice, the representation captured may or may not include speech from the\nsubject(s) and also may or may not include visible physical activity. The practice may be\nprimarily cognitive (i.e. going on inside the subject's head) and therefore may involve little\nvisible action.\n2. Think aloud\nThis is also described as 'talking while doing' or concurrent verbalization. Here the\nsubjects are filmed as they engage in the practice to be represented. The subjects will have\nbeen prompted to think aloud as they work. The practice depicted in this type of clip is\nmost likely to be one that is normally performed alone or at least to be one that does not\nnormally involve speech (otherwise there is scope for interference and confusion between\nspeech-in-the-task and speech-about-the-task).\nThe difference between this type of representation and the following type (action with\ncommentary) depends on a claim about the validity of using concurrent verbalization to\ngain access to the subject's cognitive processes. Drawing on the views of Ericsson and\nSimon (1993) on this matter, we call a clip 'think aloud' if there are reasonable grounds to\nbelieve that what we are getting in the audio track is a reasonable reflection of the subject's\ntask-related cognitive processes, and is not significantly biased by the subject's desire to\nprovide a tidied-up account of what they are doing.\n3. Action with commentary\nIn this type of representation, the subjects are encouraged to explain what they are doing\nas they work. This is different from thinking aloud because it requires the subject to create\na commentary. They are creating their representation with an audience in mind, rather\nthan being restricted to a concurrent verbalization on the task itself. The commentary may\nbe a continuous explanation as the practice unfolds, or it may be that the subjects begin,\nend or interrupt the action with a commentary.\n4. Talking head\nThis kind of representation moves further away again from the 'purity' of practice. Here\nthe subjects speak to camera about a practice in which they engage and explain aspects of\nit. It is therefore likely to be a more discursive and reflective account than the accounts in\nthe earlier examples. It may be done 'on the fly' rather than rehearsed or it may be prepared\nin advance, though not scripted (see below).\n20\nALT-J Volume 6 Number 3\nThe subject will also be conscious of audience and will be explaining a practice rather than\nparticipating in it. The clip may offer a mixture of description and reflective comment. Of\ncourse as the subjects talk about the practice they might wish to use artefacts to help\nclarify what they are saying. Such use of artefacts (etc.) from the work environment may be\na useful source of 'grounding' in talking head clips: making it harder for the subject to\ndepart (intentionally or unintentionally) from the actuality of their practices.\n5. Prepared script\nIn this type of representation, the subject prepares a written description (and possibly\ncommentary) of a practice in advance of performance. This script may be used as a\nprompt, or followed closely for verbatim reporting. This is most likely to be a single subject\nactivity.\n6. Professionally acted\nIn this final type, a professional actor who adopts the role of the actual practitioner plays\nthe subject engaged in a practice. This type of representation might involve scripting by the\nactual subject or could be prepared by a professional writer or production team in\nconsultation with the practitioner. An example would be a training video produced\ncommercially and used to illustrate how a skill or task should be undertaken. However, we\nthink this latter type of representation is less relevant to our goals since our purpose is to\nhelp practitioners, for themselves, tease out tacit knowledge embedded within their own\nworking practices.\nAnalysis 2:'Fly on the wall' and 'action with commentary'\nWe now offer a few notes about what are emerging as two potentially significant kinds of\nrepresentations of practice. As we shall see, one appears to have more potential than the\nother.\nFly on the wall\nFly-on-the-wall representations are intuitively appealing because, in principle, they are most\ntrue to practice. To the extent that the presence of a camera (or cameras) is ignored, they\noffer an unbiased picture of how work is actually done. It is therefore unfortunate that fly on\nthe wall proves to have a number of major limitations. (These limitations are rendered less\nvisible in fly-on-the-wall programmes for TV. In this currently popular genre, many hours of\nvideotape are skilfully edited down to provide a representation judged to be readily com-\nprehensible by the viewer.) As a method of cost-effectively representing practice for use in\nAMC, fly on the wall proves to be a non-starter. There are some exceptions:\n\u2022 for creating a representation of a temporally and spatially delimited 'event', such as a\nmeeting (many working practices ramble through time and space and are interleaved\nwith other working practices);\n\u2022 for other kinds of activity involving either audible discussion or visible activity, where\nthere is sufficient 'bounding' of the activity for its shape to be apprehended and\nsufficient contextual information for its content to be understood;\n\u2022 where the person creating the representation can be expected to edit the video to\nproduce something understandable.\n21\nPeter Goodyear and Christine Steeples Creating shareable representations of practice\nExcept in these kinds of circumstances, fly on the wall does not appear to be an efficient\nway of creating shareable representations.\nAction with commentary\nOne use for fly on the wall is as base material on which a commentary may be overlaid.\nThat is, a subject may create a representation of their practice - or that of others - by (a)\nselecting some appropriate clips of fly-on-the-wall video and (b) explaining what is going\non through an audio track. Such a version of action with commentary has the virtue of\nbeing solidly rooted in real world practice, though the task of selection and editing may be\nboth time-consuming and a source of bias.\nIn general, action with commentary appears to have a useful balance of strengths over\nweaknesses. It has a firmer grounding in real world activity than is the case with 'talking\nhead', for example. It can be created without excessive demands on the subject's time. In\nour trial sessions, good action with commentary clips was often made with no more than a\nminute or two's preparation. While the making of this kind of representation may not suit\neveryone, it seems to us to be sufficiently credible to warrant the investment of time by the\nproject team in developing some further models of how it may be done and to refine our\nideas about the requisite skills and technology.\nFurther work\nThe next main studies to be undertaken are intended to help vt\u00f3th our understanding of the\nuse of audio commentary on a video representation (as in action with commentary). In\nparticular, we want to get closer to answers on the following matters:\n\u2022 What processes are at work when a practitioner constructs an audio account to\naccompany a video representation of an aspect of their working practice?\n\u2022 How do other practitioners interrogate the multimedia, resources thereby created (and\nwhat do they 'take' from them)?\n\u2022 What kinds of capture technology (camera set-ups, editing tools, etc.) are best suited to\naction with commentary approaches?\n\u2022 What kinds of interface (to an AMC database) are best suited to the needs of those\ncreating and browsing such representations?\nAcknowledgements\nThis work has been carried out within the SHARP project, which is partially supported by\nthe EC SOCRATES programme's Open and Distance Learning action line.
