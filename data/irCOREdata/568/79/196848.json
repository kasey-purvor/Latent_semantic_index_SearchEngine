Modulation of p53 is a mechanism thought \nto contribute to their activity. Many flavonols are mutagenic. The hypothesis \nwas tested that a synthetic flavonol, 3\u2019,4\u2019,5\u2019-trimethoxyflavonol (TMFol), can \ninterfere with tumor development and p53 expression in two models of \ncolorectal carcinogenesis, ApcMin mice and human-derived HCT116 \nadenocarcinoma-bearing nude mice. Mice received TMFol admixed in with \ntheir diet (0.2%) from weaning to week 16 in the case of ApcMin, or from either \nday 7 prior to (\u201cTMFol early\u201d) or day 7 after (\u201cTMFol late\u201d) tumor inoculation in \nHCT116 mice. The ability of TMFol to affect tumor proliferation or apoptosis, as \nreflected by staining for Ki-67 or cleaved caspase 3, respectively, was studied \nin HCT116 tumors. TMFol tumor levels were measured by HPLC. Consumption \nof TMFol reduced small intestinal adenoma burden in ApcMin mice by 47%, \ncompared to control mice (P<0.002). The TMFol early regimen approximately \nhalved HCT116 tumor size (P<0.05), decreased tumor proliferation and \nincreased apoptosis, whilst the TMFol late regimen had no significant effect, \nwhen compared to controls. In tumor tissues from mice, in which TMFol \nreduced tumor development, p53 expression was increased, 3-fold in ApcMin \nand 1.5-fold in HCT116 tumor-bearing mice (P=0.02). TMFol increased p53 also \nin vitro in cells derived from these tumors. The level of TMFol in HCT116 \ntumors was 0.15nmol\/g. TMFol was not mutagenic in the Ames test. The \nresults suggest that chemical modification of the flavonol structure may \ngenerate safe and efficacious cancer chemopreventive agents. \n3 \n \n___________________________________________________________________ \nIntroduction \nResults of clinical trials of certain drugs, such as aspirin (1) and tamoxifen (2), \nprovide proof of principle that cancer chemoprevention is a viable option to reduce \ncancer incidence. Nevertheless, the requirement of long-term intervention in cancer \nchemoprevention and concerns about the safety on long-term use of such drugs in \nrelatively healthy humans (3,4) render the search for safe and efficacious agents \nhighly propitious. Edible plants constitute an attractive source of novel potential \ncancer chemopreventive agents, as the safety record of dietary constituents tends to \nbe good. Flavonoids, exemplified by the flavonols quercetin in onions and apples \nand epigallocatechin-3 gallate in tea and the isoflavone genistein in soya, are \nexamples of phytochemicals with suspected cancer chemopreventive properties (5-\n7). Very little information exists as to molecular features which confer \npharmacological activity on to the flavonoid scaffold. Such knowledge is required to \nhelp the rational discovery, or chemical design, of flavonoids with optimal cancer \nchemopreventive efficacy. Recent evidence suggests that the presence of methoxy \nmoieties instead of, or in addition to, hydroxy in certain flavonoids augments cancer \nchemopreventive activity (8,9). Prominent among the many mechanisms via which \nflavonoids are thought to exert their chemopreventive activity is activation of wild-\ntype p53 (10) and\/or down-regulation of its mutant counterpart (11). The tumor \nsuppressor protein p53 is involved in DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest and \napoptosis through transcriptional regulation of genes implicated in these pathways \nand by direct interaction with other proteins (12,13). P53-inactivating mutations are \npresent in more than 50% of all cancers, including colon cancer, leading to \n4 \n \naggressive, treatment-resistant malignancies (14,15). Small molecules, such as CP-\n31398, a styrylquinazoline from Pfizer, have been designed to target p53 and to \nrestore its growth suppressor function. CP-31398 reduced the growth of human \ncolon tumor xenografts in nude mice (16) and potently compromised adenoma \ndevelopment in the ApcMin mouse, accompanied by a marked increase in \nadenomatous p53 levels (17). The ApcMin mouse is a model of colorectal \ncarcinogenesis associated with an Apc mutation (18), and this model is frequently \nused in the preclinical identification of candidate colorectal cancer chemopreventive \nagents for clinical development.  \n Flavonols, exemplified by quercetin (3\u2019,4\u2019,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavonol), have been \narguably the focus of more pharmacological investigations than most other \nflavonoids. Quercetin has shown cancer chemopreventive properties in rodent \nmodels of carcinogenesis of the colon, mouth, cervix and lung (5, 19-21), and it has \nbeen subjected to a phase 1 clinical trial in cancer patients (22). Its des-hydroxy \ncogener fisetin (3\u2019,4\u2019,7-trihydroxyflavonol, for structures see fig. 1) has recently been \nfound to possess preclinical prostate cancer chemopreventive activity (23). However, \na serious toxicological impediment of many flavonols, which militates against their \ndevelopment as cancer chemopreventive agents, is their mutagenicity. Quercetin \n(24-26) and, to a lesser extent, fisetin (27), were shown to be mutagenic in the Ames \ntest. There is also limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of quercetin in animals \n(28,29). These toxicological properties of quercetin militate against its further clinical \ndevelopment. Toxicophoric structural features considered responsible for the \nmutagenic potential of flavonols include phenolic hydroxy moieties in both the A and \nB rings of the molecular scaffold (24,26,27).  \n5 \n \n Taking all these findings into consideration, we hypothesized that it might be \npossible to synthesize a flavonol with optimized pharmacological and toxicological \nproperties. We surmised that a flavonol molecule devoid of hydroxy moieties in the A \nring and bearing methoxy rather than hydroxy functionalities in the B ring may be \nnon-mutagenic and possess cancer chemopreventive efficacy. In order to test this \nhypothesis we synthesized 3\u2019,4\u2019,5\u2019-trimethoxyflavonol (TMFol) and explored its \npreclinical cancer chemopreventive properties. Initially we compared its ability to \ncompromise the growth of APC10.1 cells with that of its two naturally occurring \nflavonol cogeners quercetin and fisetin. APC10.1 cells have been derived from \nadenomas of ApcMin mice (30). Potent inhibition of the growth of APC10.1 cells in \nvitro has recently been suggested to predict the ability of a compound to interfere \nwith adenoma development in the ApcMin mouse in vivo (31). As TMFol exerted \nstrong APC10.1 cell growth\u2013inhibitory activity, we investigated its effect on adenoma \ndevelopment in ApcMin mice in vivo. Efficacy of TMFol in vivo was corroborated in a \nsecond colorectal carcinogenesis model, nude mice bearing the human colon \nadenocarcinoma-derived HCT116 xenograft. As TMFol compromised tumor \ndevelopment in vivo, we explored whether its efficacy is accompanied by alteration \nof tumor p53 expression. We also measured TMFol levels in murine target tissues, to \nrelate activity to presence of pharmacologically active agent. The potential \nmutagenicity of TMFol was investigated in the Ames reverse mutation assay using a \npanel of Salmonella Typhimurium strains, in which quercetin has shown mutagenic \nactivity (24-27). Overall the work was designed to discover safe and efficacious \ncancer chemopreventive agents structurally based on pharmacologically interesting \nplant constituents. \n6 \n \nMaterials and Methods \nChemicals and reagents \n TMFol, synthesized as described previously (32), was >99% pure as \ndetermined by HPLC analysis. 2',5',5,6,7,8-Hexamethoxyflavone used as an internal \nstandard in the HPLC analysis was supplied by the NCI Developmental Therapeutic \nProgramme Open Compound Repository (NCI, Bethesda, USA). HPLC fluorescence \ngrade methanol was purchased from Fisher Chemicals (Loughborough, UK), and \nwater for analysis was generated in a Nano-Pure water purification system \n(Barnstead, UK). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Corp. \n(Poole, UK). P53 antibodies were purchased from Dako (clone DO-7) (Ely, UK) and \nfrom Cell Signaling Technology (clone 1C12) (Hitchin, UK). Mouse and rabbit \nsecondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. \nCell growth experiments \n APC10.1 cells, kindly provided by Dr C De Giovanni (Cancer Research \nSection, University of Bologna, Italy), were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle \nmedium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Paisley, UK). HCT116 \nhuman colon adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Cell \nCollection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in McCoy\u2019s 5A (Gibco) medium \nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. \n APC10.1 or HCT116 cells from subculture 2-20 were seeded at a density of \n2x103 onto 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. TMFol, quercetin or \nfisetin dissolved in DMSO were added to cellular suspensions to yield final \nconcentrations of 0.1-5,1-40 or 0.2-8\u00b5M, respectively. Cells were incubated for up to \n7 \n \n6 days; control cells were incubated with vehicle only. The amount of DMSO added \n(0.1% final concentration) on its own did not interfere with cell growth. Cells were \nwashed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), harvested by trypsinization and \nresuspended in cell culture medium (1 ml), which was diluted 10-fold with Isoton II \nbuffer (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK). Cells in an aliquot (0.5ml) of the \nsuspension were counted using a Z2 Coulter Particle Counter with Size Analyser \n(Beckman Coulter). Growth curve experiments were conducted in triplicate, and IC50 \nvalues were calculated from a plot of cell number at day 6 (percentage of vehicle \ncontrol) versus agent concentration, using the linear phase of the curve.  \nAnimals and TMFol dose \n Breeding colonies were established using C57BL\/6J Min\/+ (ApcMin) mice \noriginally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Ear tissue from \nnewborn mice was genotyped for the presence of the mutation, using PCR as \ndescribed previously (33). Female MF-1 outbred nude mice (30\u201340g) were obtained \nfrom Harlan UK (Bicester, Oxon, UK) and ear-punched for identification. Mice were \nkept in the Leicester University Biomedical Services facility at 20\u201323\u00baC under \nconditions of 40\u201360% relative humidity and a 12h light\/dark cycle. Experiments were \ncarried out under animal project license PPL 80\/2167, granted to Leicester University \nby the UK Home Office. The experimental design was vetted by the Leicester \nUniversity Local Ethical Committee for Animal Experimentation and met the \nstandards required by the UKCCCR guidelines (34). Mice received standard AIN93G \ndiet (controls) or AIN93G diet supplemented with TMFol at 0.2%. This dietary dose \nequates to approximately 240mg\/kg per day. When extrapolated from mice to \nhumans on the basis of body surface area comparison (35), this dose is 720mg\/m2, \n8 \n \nthus 1.4g per 80kg human per day. Similar dietary doses have been commonly used \nin preclinical chemoprevention studies of other polyphenols including curcumin, \nresveratrol and anthocyanins. \nIntervention in ApcMin mice \n ApcMin mice (n=19-21 per group) received diet or diet supplemented with \nTMFol from week 4 to the end of their life (week 16). Animals were killed in week 16 \nby cardiac exsanguination under halothane anesthesia. The intestinal tract was \nremoved and flushed with PBS. Intestinal tissue was cut open longitudinally, and \nmultiplicity, location and size of adenomas in the small and large intestine were \nrecorded using a magnifying glass (x5). Polyp volume was derived from polyp \ndiameter assuming a hemispherical shape for small bowel polyps and a spherical \nshape for colon polyps, consistent with their histological appearances. Tumor burden \nwas calculated as the sum of polyp volume per animal.  \nIntervention in HCT-116 tumor-bearing nude mice \n HCT116 cells (106) suspended in matrigel:serum free medium (1:1; 100\u00b5L; \nBecton Dickinson, Worthing, UK) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of \nnude mice under light halothane anesthesia. Mice (n=14-15 per group) received \nTMFol commencing either seven days prior to, or seven days post, cell inoculation. \nMice were weighed weekly, and tumor size was measured three times per week \nusing callipers. Tumor volume was calculated by the formula: length x width2\/2, \nwhere length is the larger and width the smaller diameter of the tumor (in mm). \nAnimals were culled three weeks after tumor cell inoculation, when control tumors \nreached maximal size (17mm in length) permissible under animal welfare \n9 \n \nstipulations. Tumor tissue samples were snap-frozen (liquid nitrogen) and stored at -\n80\u00baC until analysis by Western blotting or HPLC, or fixed in 10% formalin and \nhistologically processed until analysis by immunohistochemistry. \nImmunohistochemistry \n Formalin-fixed HCT116 tumor tissue was stained for Ki-67 using a rabbit \npolyclonal Ki-67p antibody from Novocastra (Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd, \nNewcastle UK) or for cleaved caspase-3 using cleaved caspase-3 Asp 175 \npolyclonal antibody from Cell Signaling Technology (Hitchin, UK). Briefly, paraffin-\nembedded sections (4\u03bcm) mounted on polysine-coated slides were dewaxed (65\u00b0C, \n20min) and hydrated through a graded series of alcohol rinses. The antigen was \nunmasked by microwaving sections (20min) in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9). Endogenous \nperoxidase activity was inactivated by incubation of slides with hydrogen peroxide \n(3%, 10min); nonspecific binding was blocked with protein block solution \n(Novocastra). Sections were incubated with primary antibody (dilution 1:2000 for \nKi67, 1:200 for caspase 3) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing (PBS) sections, the \ntissue-antibody reaction was visualized using a commercial kit (NovoLink, \nNovocastra). All slides were scored by two independent observers blinded to the \ntreatment group. Proliferative and apoptotic indices were quantitated as the \npercentage of epithelial cells from 10 random fields of view per section which stained \npositive for Ki-67 or cleaved caspase 3, respectively. Representative fields were \nselected and the total number of epithelial cells and the number of positively staining \nepithelial cells were counted (magnification x 40; Leitz Orthoplan microscope, Leica \nDC 300 camera) for each sample. Differences in counts between the observers were \nless than 10%, and both noted the same differences between cohorts. Acquisition \n10 \n \nsoftware was Adobe Photoshop version 7. Total numbers of epithelial cells counted \non each slide were 2312\u00b1307 and 2340\u00b1154 (mean\u00b1SD, n=15) for Ki-67 and \ncleaved caspase 3 staining, respectively. \nWestern blot analysis \n Tumor tissue from control mice or mice which received TMFol was \nhomogenized with lysis buffer (1:4, w:v. PBS, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium \ndeoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, with protease inhibitors PMSF 1mM, aprotinin 2\u00b5g\/ml, \nleupeptin 5\u00b5g\/ml and phosphatase inhibitors sodium vanadate 1mM and sodium \nfluoride 1mM). The homogenate was placed on ice (15min) and then centrifuged \n(20min, 10,000xg, 4\u00baC). Cells were grown to 60\u201380% confluency, followed by \nexposure for 72h to TMFol. Cells were centrifuged (5min, 10,000xg, 4\u00baC), and the \ncell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer. Protein concentration in tissue or cell lysate \nwas determined using the Biorad protein assay (Biorad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) with \nbovine serum albumin as standard. An aliquot of protein lysate (50\u00b5g) was separated \nby SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred for 1h onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & \nSchuell, NH, USA). Blots were blocked for 2h with 5% skimmed milk in PBS\/Tween \n0.05% (PBS-T), and probed with a specific primary antiserum in PBS containing \n0.05% PBS-T and 5% non-fat dry milk (4\u00baC, overnight). After washing (PBS-T), blots \nwere treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1h and \nwashed (5X for 5min) in PBS-T. Proteins were detected by the enhanced \nchemiluminescence system (Geneflow, Staffordshire, UK). \n \n \n11 \n \nHPLC analysis \n Tissue sample preparation and HPLC analysis using fluorescence detection \nwere as described before (32) using a Varian Prostar HPLC system (Varian, UK) \nconsisting of a Varian ProStar 230 solvent delivery system, a Pro-Star 363 \nfluorescence detector, and a 410 Varian autosampler.  Separation was achieved on \na Gemini C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 3 \u00b5m, Phenomenex, UK) at a flow rate of \n0.75 mL\/min, using an isocratic mobile phase of 69% methanol in 0.1 M ammonium \nacetate buffer (pH 5.1). TMFol in tumor tissue from MF1 nude mice was quantified \nusing 2',5',5,6,7,8-hexamethoxyflavone as  an internal standard. \nReverse mutation assay \n The Ames test was conducted at a facility operating to GLP conditions by \nSafepharm Laboratories (Shardlow, Derbyshire, UK). Samonella strains TA100, 102 \nand 98, obtained from the University of California at Berkeley, were exposed to \nTMFol dissolved in DMSO using the Ames plate incorporation method at 5 dose \nlevels, both with and without a rat liver homogenate metabolism system (10% liver \nS9 with standard co-factors). The dose range for the experiment (50-5000\u00b5g\/plate) \nwas determined in a preliminary toxicity assay. Aliquots (0.1ml) of bacterial culture \nwere dispensed into test tubes followed by molten trace histidine-supplemented top \nagar (2ml), solutions (0.1ml) of TMFol, vehicle only or positive control mutagen and \neither S9 mix or phosphate buffer (0.5ml). The tube content was mixed and \ndistributed onto the surface of agar plates. The assay was conducted in triplicate for \neach strain and each concentration of TMFol or control mutagen.  \n \n12 \n \nStatistical analyses \n Values shown in the results are the mean\u00b1SD. Statistical significance was \nevaluated using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16 \nprogramme (Windows XP). Effects of TMFol on adenoma number and burden were \ncompared by Students t-test. Effects of TMFol on cell growth in vitro and xenograft \ntumor volume in vivo were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with \npost-hoc Bonferroni correction. P values <0.05 were considered significant. \n \nResults \nEffect of flavonols on tumor cell growth in vitro \n APC10.1 cells were exposed to quercetin, fisetin or TMFol, and IC50 values \nwere computed from the growth curves (Fig. 1). Of the three flavonols, TMFol was \nthe most potent cell growth inhibitor, with an IC50 of about a tenth of that for quercetin \nand a fourth of that for fisetin. In an orientation experiment TMFol also inhibited the \ngrowth of human-derived HCT116 adenocarcinoma cells, characterized by an IC50 of \n3.3\u00b5M, compared to IC50 values of >10\u00b5M for both quercetin and fisetin (mean of \nn=2, data not shown). In the light of the growth-inhibitory potency of TMFol in \nintestinal cells in vitro, its ability to compromise tumor development in the ApcMin or \nHCT116 xenograft mouse models in vivo was considered worthy of investigation.  \n \n \n \n13 \n \nEffect of TMFol on adenoma development in ApcMin mice \n ApcMin mice received TMFol at 0.2 % with their diet. Tumor development was \nreflected by burden and number of adenomas observed in the mice at the end of the \nexperiment in week 16. Consumption of TMFol almost halved adenoma burden in \nthe small intestine, albeit failing to affect adenoma burden in the colon (Fig. 2A). \nTotal adenoma number was not significantly reduced by TMFol, however when the \nproximal subsection of the small intestine was considered separately, TMFol \ndecreased both adenoma number and burden (Fig. 2B). In contrast, there was no \nsignificant effect on the middle or distal small intestine. The body weight of the ApcMin \nmice which received TMFol for their lifetime was indistinguishable from that of mice \non the control diet (result not shown). Inspection of lung, liver and kidney tissues \nfailed to reveal significant pathological abnormalities. Both observations are \nconsistent with lack of toxicity of TMFol. \nEffect of TMFol on HCT116 tumor growth in MF1 mice \n Nude MF1 mice bearing HCT116 adenocarcinoma cells received TMFol at 0.2 \n% with their diet. Tumor size was measured by calliper at 2-3 day intervals. \nConsumption of TMFol from a week prior to tumor inoculation (\u201cTMFol early\u201d) halved \ntumor size beyond day 16 post-inoculation (Fig. 3A). Dietary intervention with TMFol \ncommencing a week post tumor inoculation (\u201cTMFol late\u201d) had only a small, but not \nsignificant, tumor growth-inhibitory effect. Tumor tissue was investigated \nimmunohistochemically for the proportion of proliferating or apoptotic cells, reflected \nby staining for Ki-67 or cleaved caspase 3, respectively. Ki-67 is a granular \ncomponent of the nucleolus expressed exclusively in proliferating cells and used as \na prognostic marker in human neoplasias.  Consistent with in vivo tumor growth-\n14 \n \ninhibitory efficacy, TMFol significantly reduced cell proliferation in HCT116 tumors \nfrom mice on the TMFol early regimen, with a proliferation index of 72%, when \ncompared to tumors in control mice, with a proliferation index of 86% (Fig. 3B). \nProliferation was not reduced in tumors from mice on the TMFol late regimen. Tumor \nlevels of apoptotic cells were elevated by 55% compared to control animals in \ntumors from mice on the TMFol early regimen, whilst there was no increase in \napoptosis in tumors from mice on the TMFol late regimen (Fig. 3C).  \nEffect of TMFol on p53 expression in tumors \n In adenomas from ApcMin mice, which had consumed TMFol, tissue \nexpression of p53 was about three times the level observed in control mice (Fig. 4A). \nSimilarly, p53 expression in tumor tissue from HCT116 tumor-bearing mice on the \nTMFol early regimen was increased by 50% over expression in controls (Fig. 4B). In \ncontrast, p53 expression was not significantly increased over controls in tumors from \nmice on the TMFol late regimen. Expression of p53 was also up-regulated in \nAPC10.1 and HCT116 tumor cells in vitro, when exposed for 72h to TMFol at 5 or \n10\u00b5M, respectively, compared to cells in control incubations (Fig. 4C,D). In \npreliminary experiments, HCT116 cells exposed to TMFol showed biochemical \nchanges fully consistent with p53 upregulation: TMFol at 10\u00b5M significantly \nincreased expression of p53, p21 and Bax genes in HCT116 cells, as measured by \nRTPCR analysis, and it increased the expression of the p53 target proteins p21 and \nBax 4- and 2-fold, respectively, in HCT116 cells transfected with suitable luciferase \nconstructs (results not shown). \n \n15 \n \nAnalysis of TMFol levels in tumor tissue  \n We wished to relate the observed efficacy of TMFol to retard tumor \ndevelopment in the mouse models with agent levels achieved in the target tissues. \nHCT116 tumour tissue was obtained from nude mice at the end of the efficacy \nexperiment described in Fig. 3 and subjected to HPLC analysis (Fig. 5). Tumor levels \nof TMFol were 146\u00b180pmoles\/g tissue (mean\u00b1SD, n=6 mice), 146nM in molar \nconcentration terms. We have reported previously that the concentration of TMFol in \nthe gastrointestinal mucosa of C57BL6\/J mice, the ApcMin background strain, which \nreceived TMFol for a week at the same dietary dose as that used in the ApcMin mice \ndescribed here, was 220\u00b168nmoles\/g tissue, 220\u00b5M in concentration terms (32). \nTMFol levels in the ApcMin mice in the present study were probably of a similar order \nof magnitude. The large difference in TMFol levels between xenograft tumor and \nmurine gut reflects agent available in tissue via the circulation in the former and \nmainly unabsorbed TMFol in the latter tissue. \nLack of mutagenicity of TMFol in the Ames test \n TMFol was subjected to the Ames reverse mutation assay in order to \nestablish its mutagenic potential in vitro. Salmonella strains TA100, 102 and 98 were \ntested, the two former indicating base-pair substitution mutations and the latter \nframeshift mutations. TMFol at concentrations of up to 5mg\/plate failed to cause any \nvisible increase in the frequency of revertant colonies either in the presence or \nabsence of rat hepatic metabolic activating enzymes in any of the bacterial \nincubations (Table 1). In contrast, suitable model mutagens, both direct acting \ngenotoxicants and chemicals requiring metabolic activation, caused expected \n16 \n \nrevertant colony increases. These results demonstrate that TMFol at the \nconcentrations employed is not mutagenic in this system. \n \nDiscussion  \n The results described above provide proof of principle that judicious structural \nmodification of the quercetin molecular scaffold can generate compounds which lack \nmutagenic activity in vitro and interfere with colorectal carcinogenesis in mice in vivo. \nWhilst quercetin has shown chemopreventive properties in some preclinical models \nof oral, cervical, lung and colon carcinogenesis (5, 19-21), it was devoid of the ability \nto prevent adenoma development in the ApcMin mouse (36). Quercetin at dietary \nconcentrations of 0.3-3% has even been demonstrated to augment, rather than \ncounteract, azoxymethane-induced formation of colonic aberrant crypts and \nadenocarcinomas in rodents (37,38). Furthermore, the mutagenicity of quercetin (24-\n27) and limited evidence for its carcinogenicity (28,29) render its further development \nas a cancer chemopreventive agent unlikely. Fisetin, which is less mutagenic than \nquercetin in the Ames test (27), has not yet been investigated for adenoma \ndevelopment-retarding ability in the ApcMin mouse, even though it has shown \npromise as a putative prostate cancer chemopreventive agent (23). The synthesis of \nTMFol, the flavonol described here, was guided by a two-fold rationale: to design \nmutagenicity out of the flavonol scaffold and to impart colorectal cancer \nchemopreventive properties onto the molecule. The latter expectation was based on \nthe observation that in flavones, which are structurally closely related to flavonols, \ninclusion of methoxy moieties in the molecule led to the acquisition of superior \ncancer chemopreventive properties, when compared to the hydroxy-containing \n17 \n \ncounterpart molecules. The benefit for cancer chemopreventive activity of presence \nof methoxy functionalities is illustrated by, for example, 5,7-dimethoxyflavone and \n5,7,4\u2019-trimethoxyflavone, which were  superior to their hydroxy congeners in terms of \nnot only systemic availability in rats but also ability to inhibit oral cancer cell \nproliferation in vitro (8). Moreover, 3\u2019,4\u2019,5\u2019,5,7-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF) and tricin \n(4\u2019,5,7-trihydroxy- 3\u2019,5\u2019-dimethoxyflavone) reduced adenoma development in ApcMin \nmouse in vivo, whilst apigenin (4\u2019,5,7-trihydroxyflavone) did not (9). PMF and tricin \nalso inhibited adenoma cell growth in vitro much more potently than apigenin (9). \nThese findings imply an intrinsic advantage of methoxylated flavones over \nhydroxylated ones in terms of growth-inhibitory properties. Consistent with a \nchemoprevention-enhancing role of methoxy moieties in flavonoids, TMFol was \nshown here to interfere with tumorigenesis in two mouse models and to engage anti-\nproliferative and pro-apoptotic mechanisms in vivo. Intriguingly, in the ApcMin model \nthe adenoma development-reducing effect of TMFol was confined to the proximal \nintestine. This tissue specificity could arguably be the consequence of differences in \nlevels of TMFol between intestinal sections, with TMFol concentrations inadequate \nfor activity in the intestine beyond the proximal section. Intestinal mucosa levels of \nTMFol in C57BL\/6J mice, the ApcMin background strain, which received TMFol at \n0.2% in their diet (32), were 169-fold the IC50 for growth inhibition by TMFol in \nAPC10.1 cells. Although TMFol concentrations were not measured in specific \nintestinal subsections, the high concentration observed in the whole intestine renders \ndifferences in TMFol levels between intestinal sections unlikely as explanation for its \nselective activity in the proximal intestine. TMFol levels in the HCT116 xenograft \ntumor were only a fifteenth of the IC50 for TMFol-mediated growth inhibition in \nHCT116 cells in vitro, suggesting that HCT116 tumor cells in the intact animal \n18 \n \nenvironment in vivo are considerably more sensitive to the antiproliferative action of \nTMFol than HCT116 cells under cell culture conditions. \n The results presented above demonstrate that TMFol consumption \nupregulated wild-type p53 expression in tumor target tissues in both murine models, \na mechanism which may well contribute to the observed chemopreventive efficacy of \nTMFol. Accompanying preliminary results in HCT116 cells in vitro intimate that p53 \nupregulation by TMFol has functional consequences as adjudged by induction of \ndownstream promotors. The study of CP-31398 (17) referred to in the introduction \nprovides convincing support for the notion that increasing expression and activation \nof wild-type p53 reduces intestinal adenoma development in the ApcMin mouse, \nprobably via suppression of adenoma cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. \nThe p53-modulating ability of flavonoids in cells in vitro has been described before \n(10,11,39-42), although flavonoid-mediated upregulation of p53 in intact animals has \nto our knowledge been shown previously only for the flavone apigenin (4\u2019,5,7-\ntrihydroxyflavone) in mice bearing the 22Rv1 prostate tumor xenograft (41). TMFol at \n10\u00b5M doubled p53 protein expression in HCT116 cells in vitro, and fisetin has been \nreported to have a similar effect (40). In contrast, quercetin at up to 40\u00b5M failed to \naffect p53 expression in this cell type (42), although it increased p53 phosphorylation \nstatus. In the light of the order of growth-inhibitory potency of the three flavonols in \nvitro shown here (TMFol>fisetin>quercetin), and the fact that quercetin was devoid of \nactivity in the ApcMin mouse, these differences in p53 modulatory potency tentatively \nhint at a mechanistic link between upregulation of p53 and cancer chemopreventive \nactivity in mice. The mechanisms by which TMFol increased p53 expression in the \nApcMin and HCT116 xenograft models as described here, remain to be elucidated. \n19 \n \nOn the basis of the literature pertaining to the p53-modulating effects of CP-31398 \n(cited in 17), these mechanisms are likely to be complex and model-dependent. It is \nworth emphasising that TMFol is likely to engage anti-carcinogenic mechanisms \nother than p53 modulation, and these mechanisms need to be identified in future \nstudies.  \n The mutagenic activity of flavonols has been associated with hydroxy moieties \nin rings A and B of the molecular scaffold (24,25), and their methylation decreased \nmutagenic activity (24,27). Consistent with these toxicophoric structural features, \nTMFol, which bears no hydroxy moieties in ring A and three methoxys in ring B, was \nshown here to be devoid of mutagenic properties in the Ames test. Furthermore, the \nobserved absence of detrimental effects of TMFol on murine body weight or organ \npathology augurs well for its safety profile. Nevertheless, the putative safety of \nTMFol needs to be elucidated carefully in further preclinical experiments. \n In summary, the properties of TMFol described here support the notion that \nchemical modification of the flavonol structure based on existing, albeit scarce, \ninformation on the relationship between flavonoid structure and chemopreventive \nactivity or toxicity may generate useful cancer chemopreventive agents. It is \nconceivable that, with further acquisition of knowledge of the important molecular \ntargets of flavonoids and their structure-activity relationships, the flavonol structure \ncan be optimized even more, beyond TMFol. Nevertheless, in the light of its \nfavorable pharmacological profile described here, TMFol deserves additional \npreclinical investigation to help adjudge whether it is worthy of advancement to the \nstage of clinical development. TMFol should be studied for chemopreventive efficacy \nin other rodent carcinogenesis models. It might also be propitious to investigate \n20 \n \ncombinations of TMFol together with agents, such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors, \nwhich engage complimentary chemoprevention mechanisms. \n \nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest \nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.  \nAcknowlegements  \n Grant support: The study was funded by programme grant C325\/A6691 from \nCancer Research UK and a Welcome Vacation Studentship. \n We thank Drs C De Giovanni (Dept Experimental Pathol, University of \nBologna) and L Landuzzi (Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institutes, Bologna, Italy) for provision \nof APC10.1 cells, and Abigail Choong for help with experiments. \n \n \n \nReferences \n1.

Effect of quercetin (A), fisetin (B) or TMFol (C) on the growth of APC10.1 \ncells. Cells were counted after exposure to flavonols for 6 days. Values are the \nmean\u00b1SD of three independent experiments, each conducted in triplicate. Chemical \nstructures and IC50 values for growth inhibition are inserted. IC50 values are \nsignificantly different from each other (P<0.001 by ANOVA). \nFig. 2. Effect of consumption of TMFol on burden (top) and number (bottom) of \nadenomas in the total small intestine or colon (A) and in small intestinal subsections \n(B) of ApcMin mice. Mice received AIN93 diet (control) or AIN93 diet fortified with \nTMFol (0.2 %) from weaning (week 4) until week 16, when they were killed, and \nadenoma number and burden were measured. Values are the mean\u00b1SD of n=19 \n(control) or 21 mice (TMFol). Statistical comparison was by Students t-test; P values \nabove bars indicate significant differences between mice on TMFol and controls.  \nFig. 3. Effect of consumption of TMFol (0.2% in the diet) on growth of the HCT116 \nadenocarcinoma xenograft in nude MF1 mice (A), and on proliferation and apoptosis \nin HCT116 tumor tissue as reflected by staining for Ki-67 (B) and cleaved caspase 3 \n(C). Mice received TMFol from either a week prior to (squares in A, \u201cTMFol early\u201d in \nB, C), or a week post tumor inoculation (triangles in A, \u201cTMFol late\u201d in B,C). Tumor \nvolume in A was measured by calliper (see Materials and Methods). B and C show \nphotomicrographs of tumor tissue stained for KI-67 (B) or cleaved caspase 3 (C), \n27 \n \nbars reflect densitometry readings. Note that in B ordinate commences at 60%. Bars \nin the photomicrographs (B,C) are 50\u00b5m. Values are the mean\u00b1SD of n=14 (TMFol \nlate) or 15 mice (control and TMFol early) in A and of 8-10 per group in B and C. \nAsterisks in A indicate that tumor volume in the TMFol early group (squares) was \nsignificantly smaller than that in control mice (P values: 0.036, 0.049 and 0.007 for \ndays 16, 19 and 21, respectively), P values above bars denote statistical difference \nin B and C. Statistical analysis was by one-way ANOVA with posthoc Bonferoni \ncorrection.   \nFig. 4. p53 Protein expression in adenomas of ApcMin mice (A) or in HCT116 tumor \nxenografts from nude MF1 mice (B) which received TMFol (0.2%) with their diet, and \nin APC10.1 (C) or HCT116 cells (D) which were exposed to TMFol at the indicated \nconcentrations for 72h before harvest. Tumour tissue was obtained from the ApcMin \n(A) or HCT116 xenograft mice (B) described in Figs 2 and 3. Analysis was by \nWestern blotting. Bars reflect densitometric evaluation of bands, and values are the \nmean\u00b1SD of 6 (control) and 12 (TMFol) (A) or 14-15 mice (B), and of 3 (C) or 4 (D) \nindependent cell exposure experiments, each conducted in triplicate. Asterisk with \nappropriate P values indicate that the difference between intervention and control \nwas significant, analyses were by Students t-test (A) or by one-way ANOVA with \nposthoc Bonferoni correction (B,C,D).  \nFig. 5.
