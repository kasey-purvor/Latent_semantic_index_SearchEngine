INTRODUCTION\nA longstanding goal in the theory of liquids has been that\nof predicting the molecular dynamics and transport proper-\nties for a given intermolecular potential, based solely on first\nprinciple statistical mechanical arguments. The first step in\nthis direction was made by Enskog, who developed a kinetic\ntheory of the transport coefficients of hard sphere fluids\nbased on the Boltzmann equation \u0001see, e.g., Ref. \u00031\u0004 for a\ngood account\u0002. The assumptions in his theory are that each\ncollision is instantaneous \u0001i.e., a delta function in time\u0002 and\nindependent of other previous collisions \u0001i.e., it ignores cor-\nrelated collision sequences\u0002, and the collision rate is propor-\ntional to the local density around a given particle \u0001measured\nthrough the contact value of the radial distribution function\u0002.\nActually the formulas he derived for the transport coeffi-\ncients are surprisingly accurate up to quite high \u0001liquidlike\u0002\ndensities, especially for the thermal conductivity \u00032\u0004. Empiri-\ncal correction formulas to the basic Enskog expressions\nbased on Molecular Dynamics computer simulation data\nhave been derived for the four transport coefficients \u0001see for\nexample, Ref. \u00032\u0004\u0002. The hard-sphere fluid is, however, some-\nwhat pathological as far as the particle dynamics is con-\ncerned \u00033\u0004 and of course such a potential does not exist in\nnature.\nThere has been some success in extending Enskog\u2019s origi-\nnal treatment to arbitrary continuous potentials \u0001see Refs.\n\u00031,4\u0004, Secs. 2.7\u20132.9, for discussion of this\u0002, but an alternative\napproach based on the work of Green \u00035\u0004 and Kubo \u00036\u0004 has\nattracted more attention in recent years. This \u201cGreen\u2013Kubo\u201d\ntreatment expresses a transport coefficient as \u0001apart from a\nsystem constant\u0002 the integral of a time autocorrelation func-\ntion, \u0005\u0001t\u0002= \u0005A\u00010\u0002A\u0001t\u0002\u0006, where t is time and \u0005\u00af\u0006 denotes an\naverage over time origins. The quantity A is a flux which can\nbe defined at the molecular level in terms of various quanti-\nties including the intermolecular potential. Therefore knowl-\nedge of the time correlation function leads automatically to\nthe transport coefficient. Although the interaction potential\nand the relevant time correlation are implicitly linked, to date\nclosed analytic form solutions for arbitrary realistic poten-\ntials valid at all times, have eluded us. Nevertheless, the\nformally exact nature of the time correlation function ap-\nproach does provide a sound basis for developing approxi-\nmate solutions \u0005\u0001t\u0002 and, hence, the transport coefficient. For\nexample, using projection operators for relevant and weakly\ncoupled degrees of freedom, it can be shown that the time\ncorrelation function can be expressed in terms of a more\nfundamental time dependent \u0001\u201cmemory\u201d\u0002 function, \u0006\u0001t\u0002, in\nthe form of an integrodifferential equation called the gener-\nalized Langevin equation \u0001GLE\u0002 \u0001see e.g., Chap. 9 in Ref. \u00037\u0004\nand Sec. 2.6 in Ref. \u00034\u0004\u0002. Indeed the memory function can\nitself be expressed as a GLE, and so on as a hierarchy. A\nclosed expression for \u0005 requires the inclusion of a specific\nfunctional form for the memory function at some termination\nstage. Normally the Laplace transform \u0001LT\u0002 of these equa-\ntions is considered, which forms a continued fraction expan-\nsion to be closed at nth order by the LT of such a terminating\nfunction. Alternatively the series can be continued indefi-\nnitely by assuming a relationship between the memory func-\ntions at arbitrary levels n and n+1 \u0001see for example Refs.\n\u00038,9\u0004\u0002. An alternative approach is to attempt to derive an\nexpression for the memory function of a particular fluid from\nfirst principles \u000310\u0004, and this is the approach taken in this\nwork.\nThe particular fluid we study is one consisting of \u201cmol-\necules\u201d interacting through a steeply repulsive central poten-\ntial. In previous publications \u000311\u0004, we have studied several\nthermodynamic properties of such fluids which approach\nthose of the hard sphere fluid as the steepness rises. We find\nsmall quantitative corrections to the hard sphere results.

We find an ap-\nproximate analytic solution for short times for steeply repul-\nsive potentials, in which there is a clear separation of time\nscales between the binary collision itself and subsequent col-\nlisions. By solving the equations of relative motion of a pair\nof particles for any initial condition, we have obtained an\nexplicit expression for the integrand of that expression, and\nhence, the memory function. As we ignore multiparticle scat-\ntering, mode coupling, and hydrodynamic effects, we expect\nthat our results will be accurate only for short times.\nIn a recent paper Dufty and Ernst \u00033\u0004 have reported a\ncalculation of the velocity and force autocorrelation func-\ntions for a steeply repulsive potential. They also include only\nthe effect of binary collisions and express their results for\nshort times in terms of a scaling function. As their physical\nassumptions are the same as ours, there should be a relation-\nship between their results for the correlation functions and\nour results for the memory function. As they have not yet\npublished the full details of their calculation we have not yet\nbeen able to establish this relationship although both produce\nnumerical results which agree with computer simulation. We\ndiscuss this further in our concluding section.\nII. THE MEMORY FUNCTION FOR STEEPLY REPULSIVE\nPOTENTIALS\nWhen two hard spheres collide each moves freely until\nthe moment of collision at which time the separation of their\ncenters is the molecular diameter, \u0003. After the collision the\nspheres again move freely but with a momentum altered by\nthe collision. The collision takes place instantaneously and at\nthe separation, \u0003. As was pointed out in Sec. I, one conse-\nquence of this is that at short times the memory function for\na hard sphere fluid is abnormal. In fact it contains a delta\nfunction in t whereas the expansion is normally analytic in t\n\u0001see Ref. \u000312\u0004\u0002.\nSimilarly when two molecules moving with thermal\nspeeds interact through a steeply repulsive potential, they\nwill influence each other only within a short distance of an\nappropriate hard sphere separation, \u0003. The collision will take\nplace only over a short time and only when the separation is\nclose to \u0003. They will start to influence each other signifi-\ncantly only when their separation is slightly greater than \u0003\nand they will penetrate each other slightly, i.e., their mini-\nmum separation will be slightly less than \u0003. The collision,\ntherefore, takes place over a short but finite time and within\na short part of their separation close to \u0003. These facts enable\nus to solve the equations of motion with a consistent ap-\nproximation. Since the collision takes a finite, even if short,\ntime the expansion of the autocorrelation functions is now\nnormal and quadratic in t.\nAs stated in the introduction our approach to this problem\nis through the memory function, \u0006\u0001t\u0002, for a fluid. Implicitly\nthe memory function is related to the velocity autocorrelation\nfunction, \u0005\u0001t\u0002. In terms of their respective Laplace trans-\nforms, \u0006\u02dc\u0001z\u0002 and \u0005\u02dc \u0001z\u0002, the relationship is\n\u0003mz + \u0006\u02dc\u0001z\u0002\u0004\u0005\u02dc \u0001z\u0002 = \u0005\u00010\u0002 , \u00012.1\u0002\nwhere m is the mass of a fluid molecule. This is simply a\ngeneralization of the Langevin equation. A formal definition\nof the memory function has been given by Zwanzig \u000313\u0004 and\nby Mori \u000314\u0004 but we do not need to use it here. Instead we\nuse a result for the memory function derived by Miyazaki,\nSrivivas, and Bagchi \u000310\u0004. Starting from the formal definition\nof the memory function and using results due to Mazenko\nand Yip \u000315\u0004 they derive, for a one-component fluid of mol-\necules interacting through two-body interactions only and\nwith the assumption that the transport properties are domi-\nnated by binary collisions, a closed expression for the\nmemory function. For molecules interacting through a cen-\ntral intermolecular potential, \u0001\u0001r\u0002, their result can be ex-\npressed in terms of the pair distribution function of the fluid,\ng\u0001r\u0002, and of the Boltzmann distribution function for a particle\nof mass m \/2; their formula for the memory function in this\ncase is\n\u0006\u0001t\u0002 = \u2212\n\b\n3 \b\t=1. . .3 \u0007 d3p\u0007 d3rf\u0001p\u0002\u0001g\u0001r\u0002\u0001r\t \u0001\u0001\u201er\u0001t\u0002\u2026\u0001r\t\u0001t\u0002 ,\n\u00012.2\u0002\nwhere\nf\u0001p\u0002 = \u0001\nmkBT\u0002\u22123\/2 exp\u0001\u2212 p2\/mkBT\u0002 . \u00012.3\u0002\nThe vector r\u0001t\u0002 is the radius vector between the centers of a\npair of molecules at a time t when their separation and rela-\ntive momentum at the initial time were r and p; it describes\ntheir relative motion in their center-of-mass frame.\nIn this section we evaluate the memory function, as far as\nis possible analytically, for the case of a fluid of molecules\ninteracting through the steeply repulsive model central po-\ntential\n\u0001\u0001r\u0002 = \u0002\t\u0003\nr\n\nn, \u00012.4\u0002\nin the limit that n becomes very large. When n\u2192\u0007 the po-\ntential becomes the hard sphere one. In the hard-sphere limit\nthe collision is instantaneous and the memory function is\nlocal and as already pointed out becomes a delta function\n\u000316\u0004. But when n is finite the collision does take time, even if\nG. RICKAYZEN AND D. M.

Although we use the specific\npotential as given by Eq. \u00012.4\u0002 in this section, it is shown in\nSec. IV that the theory applies mutatis mutandis to other\nsteeply repulsive potentials \u0001SRPs\u0002.\nFrom thermodynamics \u000317\u0004 and from irreversible pro-\ncesses \u000318\u0004 it has been shown that for SRPs the optimal\nchoice for the diameter of the hard sphere reference fluid is\nthat given by the Barker\u2013Henderson equation \u000317\u0004. For the\nparticular potential defined by Eq. \u00012.4\u0002, to leading order in\n1\/n, this diameter is the \u0003 in the definition of the potential.\nIn order to evaluate the memory function from Eq. \u00012.2\u0002\nwe need to find \u0001(r\u0001t\u0002) by solving the equation of motion in\nthe center-of-mass frame of the two molecules.

Hence, \u0006\u0001t\u0002 is propor-\ntional to the single function K\u0001x\u0002. Earlier in this section we\ninterpreted \u000b\u22121 as the duration of an individual collision.\nLikewise, we interpret \u000bA\n\u22121 as the average duration of a col-\nlision. Hence, the variable x is the time measured in units of\nthe average duration of a collision.\nIn the leading approximation in n used in this paper, \u0006\u0001t\u0002\ndoes not depend upon kBT \/\u0002. Because \u0010\u0003R\u0004 is the value of\nthe repulsive potential at the time t, it is positive. Hence, in\nthis approximation the memory function is positive at all\ntimes. Furthermore, as is required for a continuous potential\nit is analytic at short times.\nIII. HARD SPHERES IN THE LIMIT n\\\u0001\nMiyazaki et al. \u000310\u0004 have already shown that \u0006\u02dc\u00010\u0002 and,\nhence, the diffusion constant agree with Enskog\u2019s result \u000312\u0004\nin the hard sphere limit of n\u2192\u0007. We wish to show that this\nis true for all values of t despite the further approximations\nwe have made.\nTo demonstrate this we need to make the dependence on n\nexplicit. Inspection of Eqs. \u00012.17\u0002\u2013\u00012.20\u0002 reveals that \u0006\u0001t\u0002\ndepends on n through factors of n in the overall constant c\nand in x but note that xm\u000e\u000btm is defined by Eq. \u00012.13\u0002 and is\nMEMORY FUNCTION FOR A FLUID OF MOLECULES\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 061204 \u00012005\u0002\n061204-3\nindependent of n. To show the dependence on n explicitly we\nwrite\nx = ntR; \t = exp\u0001\u2212 \u000btm\u0002 = exp\u0001\u2212 xm\u0002 , \u00013.1\u0002\nand consider the limit\nlim\nn\u2192\u0007\n\u0001n\u0010\u000b\u0003R\u0004\f\u0002 . \u00013.2\u0002\nWhen tR\u00020 this is\nlim\nn\u2192\u0007\n\u00134nw exp\u0003\u2212 ntR + sgn\u0001\u000f\u0002\u0004\u000b1 + exp\u0003\u2212 ntR + sgn\u0001\u000f\u0002\u0004\f2\u0014 = 0. \u00013.3\u0002\nHowever, when tR=0 the limit is infinite.

OTHER STEEPLY REPULSIVE POTENTIALS\nOther steeply repulsive potentials can be treated in a simi-\nlar way. The hard-sphere radius is defined as before by the\nBarker\u2013Henderson formula. The specific potential enters the\ncalculation at the derivation of the relationship between R\u02d9\nand \u0001\u02d9 . In general\n\u0001\u02d9 \u0001R\u0002 = \u0001\u0001\u0001R\u0002R\u02d9 = k\u0001R\u0002\u0001\u0001R\u0002R\u02d9 , \u00014.1\u0002\nwhere\nk\u0001R\u0002 =\n\u0001\u0001\u0001R\u0002\n\u0001\u0001R\u0002\n=\nd ln\u0003\u0001\u0001R\u0002\u0004\ndr\n. \u00014.2\u0002\nThe advantage of introducing the function k\u0001R\u0002 is that, in the\nregion where the potential is a rapidly varying function of\nposition, this function is slowly varying. Our result is limited\nto steeply repulsive potentials for which the function k\u0001R\u0002 is\nslowly varying. In this general case the equation for the con-\nservation of energy, Eq. \u0001A4\u0002, becomes\n\u0001\u02d9 2\nk2\u0001R\u0002\u00012\u0001R\u0002\n=\n4E\nm\n\u2212\n4l2\nm2R2\n\u2212\n4\u0001\nm\n. \u00014.3\u0002\nNow, since one is particularly concerned to solve this equa-\ntion in the neighborhood of R=\u0003 where only the potential is\nvarying rapidly, one can, to leading order, replace R and k\u0001R\u0002\nby \u0003 and k\u0001\u0003\u0002 respectively, except within the potential and\nits derivatives, Eq. \u00014.3\u0002 then becomes\n\u0001\u02d9 2\nk2\u0001\u0003\u0002\u00012\u0001R\u0002\n=\n4E\nm\n\u2212\n4l2\nm2\u00032\n\u2212\n4\u0001\nm\n. \u00014.4\u0002\nA comparison of this equation with Eq. \u0001A4\u0002 shows that the\neffect of using different SRPs is to replace the steepness\nparameter n by the steepness parameter \u0003k\u0001\u0003\u0002. The final re-\nsult for the memory function is therefore unchanged except\nthat the appropriate steepness parameter replaces n. As an\nexample consider the repulsive exponential potential\n\u0001\u0001r\u0002 = exp\u0003\u0015\u0001\u0003 \u2212 r\u0002\u0004 . \u00014.5\u0002\nfor \u0015\u0003 very large. In this case\nk\u0001R\u0002 = \u0015 ,\nand is actually constant. The steepness parameter is then \u0015\u0003\nand this replaces n in the formulas given in Eqs.\n\u00012.17\u0002\u2013\u00012.20\u0002 for the memory function.\nV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIn order to test the approximations made in the previous\nsections we have compared results for the memory function\ncomputed from Eq. \u00012.17\u0002 to Eq. \u00012.20\u0002 with results from\nMolecular Dynamics simulation of the same fluid at the same\nstate point. The memory function was computed by numeri-\ncal integration of the integrodifferential Eq. \u00013.2.7\u0002 given on\npage 109 in Ref. \u00034\u0004.\n\u0006\u0001t\u0002 = CF\u0001t\u0002 \u2212 \u0007\n0\nt\ndt\u0001\u0006\u0001t \u2212 t\u0001\u0002\u0005\u02d9 \u0001t\u0001\u0002 , \u00015.1\u0002\nwhere CF\u0001t\u0002 is the force autocorrelation function \u0001FACF\u0002 and\n\u0006\u00010\u0002=CF\u00010\u0002. Both CF\u0001t\u0002 and the velocity autocorrelation\nfunction, \u0005\u0001t\u0002 are computed directly in the Molecular Dy-\nnamics simulation. These results are likely to be more reli-\nable at short times rather than long ones.\nWe used units in which m=\u0003=1 and selected states for\nwhich kBT=1. The effect of this is that \u0006\u0001t\u0002 is measured in\nunits of kBT \/\u00032 and time is measured in units of\n\u000f\u0001m\u00032 \/kBT\u0002. We report the results for five different samples\nlabeled A\u2013E and with values of the parameters n and the\npacking fraction, \u0016 as given in Table I. For further details of\nthe Molecular Dynamics simulations see for example Ref.\n\u000311\u0004. In Figs. 1\u20133 we compare the results of the theory with\nthose calculated from simulation. In all the figures the sub-\nscripts A\u2013E refer to the different simulations while the sub-\nG. RICKAYZEN AND D. M. HEYES PHYSICAL REVIEW E 71, 061204 \u00012005\u0002\n061204-4\nscript T refers to the theory. The theory depends upon the\ncavity function and for that we use the Carnahan\u2013Starling\nformula \u000320\u0004.\nIn Fig. 1 we compare the raw memory function as derived\nfrom simulation A plotted as a function of the time with the\nresults of the present theory. In Figs. 2 and 3 we compare the\n\u201cnormalized\u201d dimensionless function K\u0001x\u0002 as a function of\nthe dimensionless variable x. Figure 2 is for the cases with\nn=72 while Fig. 3 is for n=144. According to the theory all\nthe curves in Fig. 2 and 3 should overlap. In fact they agree\nvery well for small times until x\r4 during which period the\nmemory function falls by a factor of about 100. According to\nour interpretation this is the time of about four times the\nduration of the binary collision and probably beyond the ra-\ndius of convergence of a Taylor expansion, so that micro-\nscopically it is reasonably long. In Fig. 2 the curves from the\ntheory and from the simulation B overlap and one cannot\ndiscriminate between them. After the \u201ctime\u201d x\u00154 the curves\ndrift apart; the memory function derived from simulation\neventually becomes negative, whereas, as pointed out in Sec.\nII the theoretical result remains positive for all times. At\npresent we do not know whether this difference is due to\nshortcomings of the theory or limitations of the derivation\nfrom simulation or perhaps both.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nAs we pointed out in the Introduction, Dufty and Ernst\n\u00033\u0004, apparently starting from the same physical assumptions,\nhave derived scaling formulas for the VACF and FACF at\nshort times in the hard sphere limit. There should be a rela-\ntionship between their scaling functions and our scaling\nfunction, K\u0001x\u0002, but we have not yet established this. They\nclaim that their results are asymptotically exact in the hard\nsphere limit of infinite n, and they certainly agree very well\nwith data for Molecular Dynamics \u0001MD\u0002 simulations using\nn=1152 \u0001see Ref. \u00033\u0004\u0002. Our comparison with simulation sug-\ngests that for the memory function the validity extends down\nto at least n\u001572. Further work clearly needs to be carried\nout to establish the domain of applicability of these various\napproaches.\nIn summary, on the assumption that binary collisions are\nthe dominant scattering process, we have derived a closed\nexplicit and tractable formula for the velocity autocorrelation\nfunction memory function for a fluid of molecules interact-\ning through a steeply repulsive potential. This result reduces\nto that of Enskog in the limit of hard spheres and is a gen-\neralization of his result. It has been shown that the final\nexpression agrees with that derived from Molecular Dynam-\nics simulation of steeply repulsive particles for short times.\nSystems with interaction potentials of the kind studied here\nare more relevant to colloidal systems. Although such poten-\ntials are not realistic for simple molecular liquids, there is a\ndearth of potential forms for which accurate results can be\nderived. In the absence of more realistic systems Enskog\u2019s\ntheory has proved to be a useful guide in the past. Because of\nthe more realistic systems studied in this paper there is some\nexpectation that the new results presented here are simple\nenough to prove helpful in future studies.\nTABLE I.

We require only\nthe conservation equations for the angular momentum and\nthe energy.

In that case accord-\ning to our previous work \u000311\u0004 the gradient of the pair distri-\nbution function which appears in the integrand of Eq. \u00012.2\u0002\nhas a narrow peak when r ,R\r\u0003, the width of the peak being\nproportional to \u0003 \/n. Furthermore nearly all the scattering\ntakes place within a region where R\r\u0003, indeed R\u2212\u0003\n\r\u0003 \/n. However, although R varies little in the integrand the\npotential can and does vary between 0 and \u0007. We exploit\nthese features of the problem to solve Eq. \u0001A1\u0002 analytically.\nWe begin by changing the dependent variable to \u0001 and\nuse the fact that\n\u0001\u02d9 = \u2212 n\u0002\nR\u02d9\nR\t\u0003R\n\nn\n= \u2212\nn\nR\n\u0001R\u02d9 \u0001A3\u0002\nto substitute for R\u02d9 in Eq. \u0001A1\u0002.

Note that\nwhen the sign is negative, \u0001\u0001R\u0002 decreases to zero with time\nand the molecules are separating. Similarly when the sign is\npositive \u0001\u0001R\u0002 increases with time and the molecules are ap-\nproaching. Initially the relative radial momentum of the mol-\necules is\np . r\/r = p cos \f\u000e p\u000f ,\nand if this is positive the molecules are separating initially\nand they continue to separate thereafter.
