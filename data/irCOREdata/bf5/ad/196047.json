Risk factors associated with increased mortality in\npatients with CHF include, hypotension, anaemia,\nincreased BNP levels, activation of the renin-angiotensin\nsystem, and decreased renal function [2, 7, 9, 10, 13, 18,\n22, 27]. The precise nature of renal dysfunction in CHF\npatients remains to be elucidated. It has been suggested that\nthe decreased cardiac output, increased inflammation and\noxidative stress may challenge the function and integrity of\nthe kidney in patients with CHF [4, 17]. At some point, a\nglomerulus may be irreversibly damaged, leading to\n\u2018\u2018nephron dropout\u2019\u2019 and accumulating into a progressive\ndecline of renal function. Recently, we provided pre-\nliminary data suggesting a possible association between\nshorter telomere length and reduced renal function in a\nretrospective study [23]. We hypothesized that a more\nadvanced intrinsic biological age, reflected by telomere\nlength, increases the susceptibility of the kidney to lose\nfunction in the challenged physiological environment\nevoked by CHF.\nTelomeres are considered indicators of biological age\nand are heritable structures located at the extreme ends of\nchromosomes. Telomeres consist of specific nucleotide\nL. S. M. Wong \u0001 P. van der Harst (&) \u0001 R. A. de Boer \u0001\nJ. Huzen \u0001 H. L. Hillege \u0001 A. A. Voors \u0001\nW. H. van Gilst \u0001 T.

In conjunction\nwith several telomere-binding proteins, telomeres protect\nchromosomes from recognition and degradation by DNA\ndamage signalling pathways [6]. When telomeres become\ncritically short, they lose their protective function and cells\nbecome genetically instable, causing senescence or apop-\ntosis [3]. Telomeres are incompletely replicated by DNA\npolymerase, causing cumulative attrition of length after\neach cell division and marking replicative history [16].\nAdditional telomere attrition can be caused by damaging\nexternal factors (e.g., oxidative stress, activation of the\nrenin-angiotensin system) [25, 26]. The aim of our study is\nto explore whether systemic leukocyte telomere length is\nassociated with renal function in patients with CHF.\nMethods\nThis study was a sub-study of the Coordinating Study\nEvaluating Outcomes of Advising and Counseling in Heart\nFailure (COACH) of which the main findings have been\npublished [11, 12]. The COACH-study assessed the value\nof additional support by a specialized heart failure nurse in\nthe treatment of CHF. Eligible patients were aged 18 years\nor older, had typical signs and symptoms, and evidence for\nstructural heart disease confirmed by cardiovascular\nimaging. Patients did not necessarily have to have impaired\nleft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). At hospital dis-\ncharge, patients were stable and on oral heart failure\nmedication. In total, 157 (15%) of the 1,023 patients who\nparticipated in the COACH were not included in this sub-\nstudy, mainly because of no available DNA (n = 133) or\nmissing serum creatinine values (n = 18). This study has\nbeen approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee. All\npatients gave written informed consent.\nRenal function and telomere length\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated at\nenrollment with the simplified Modification of Diet in\nRenal Diseases equation [186.3 9 (serum creatinine\/\n88.4)-1.154 9 age-0.203, in women multiplied by 0.742],\nwhich is one of the most precise and accurate formulas for\ncalculating GFR [19]. A venous blood sample was taken\nfrom the patients during the first outpatient visit and DNA\nisolated from it according to standard protocols (Qiagen,\nsubsidiary Benelux B.V. Venlo, The Netherlands; QIAmp\n96 DNA Blood kit, catalog no. 51162). Mean leukocyte\ntelomere length was measured by quantitative polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) in leukocytes, as previously described\nin detail [21]. Telomere length is expressed as T\/S ratio,\nwhich is the relative ratio of telomere repeat copy number\n\u2018\u2018T\u2019\u2019 to a single-gene copy number \u2018\u2018S\u2019\u2019 (36B4). All\nsamples were assayed in triplicates on separate PCR plates,\nbut in same well positions. The mean \u00b1 SD coefficient of\nvariation was 7 \u00b1 5% for the T-assay, and 6 \u00b1 4% for S\nassay.\nStatistical analysis\nTelomere length ratio was natural log transformed to obtain\na normal distribution. Baseline characteristics were com-\npared among quartiles of estimated glomerular filtration\nrate (eGFR) by one-way analysis of variance, Kruskal\u2013\nWallis test, or Chi-square when appropriate. Pearson cor-\nrelation coefficient was used to assess the association\nbetween leukocyte telomere length and renal function.\nStandard linear regression techniques were used to adjust\nfor age and gender in a second model and additionally for\nage of CHF onset in a third model. This third basic model\nwas used to subsequently adjust for baseline differences.\nBecause renal function cannot be assumed to be linearly\nrelated to leukocyte telomere length, it was also modeled as\na fractional polynomial function. A two-sided P value of\n\\0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nAll statistical analyses were performed with use of STATA\nversion 10.0 for Windows software (StataCorp LP, College\nStation, TX, USA).\nResults\nBaseline characteristics according to quartiles of eGFR are\npresented in Table 1. The study population consisted of\n61% men, median age was 74 years, median LVEF was\n30%, with most patients in NYHA class II and III (together\n97%). Patients with decreased renal function were less\nlikely to be men, and more likely to be older of age, to have\nhigher NYHA class, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrilla-\ntion or flutter, lower hemoglobin levels, and a previous\nadmission for CHF (Table 1).\nEstimated GFR decreased with age at a yearly rate of\n0.70 \u00b1 0.058 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 (P \\ 0.001). Telomere\nlength ratio decreased steadily at a mean rate of\n0.0035 \u00b1 0.00064 per year of increase of age (P \\ 0.001).\nTelomere length was 0.719 (interquartile range 0.609\u2013\n0.881) in the quartile with the highest eGFR, 0.710 (0.604\u2013\n0.855) in quartile 2, 0.673 (0.582\u20130.834) in quartile 3, and\n0.667 (0.571\u20130.825) in the quartile with the lowest eGFR\n(P = 0.031). When leukocyte telomere length was mod-\neled as a continuous predictor, renal function decreased\ngradually with shorter telomere length. Pearson correlation\ncoefficient for the association between telomere length and\neGFR was 0.123 (P \\ 0.001). The relationship between\nrenal function and telomere length remained significant\nafter adjustment for gender and age (standardized-beta\n630 Clin Res Cardiol (2009) 98:629\u2013634\n123\n0.090; Table 2).

This observation remained significant\nafter adjustment for several confounders, including age,\nage of CHF onset, and severity of CHF.\nTelomere length is associated with CHF. We recently\ndemonstrated telomere length to be shorter in 620 patients\nwith CHF compared to healthy controls [21]. This was also\nobserved by others [15]. In addition, levels of TRF2\u2014one\nof the telomere-stabilizing proteins\u2014in the myocardium of\nheart failure patients was found to be down-regulated by\napproximately 50% compared to healthy controls [15].\nInterestingly, Werner et al. found that physical exercise in\nmice up-regulated TRF2, and protected the myocardium\nfrom doxorubicin-induced apoptosis [28]. Thus, telomere\nbiology is not only associated with CHF, but seems to be a\nmodifiable factor in heart failure. Possibly, telomeres are a\nnew therapeutic target in heart failure.\nA retrospective analysis of the cohort of 620 CHF\npatients suggested a potential association between telo-\nmere length and renal function [23]. Obviously, retro-\nspective analysis is susceptible to type-1 errors. The\ncurrent prospective study, however, provides important\nindependent confirmation of these preliminary findings.\nReduced renal function might be associated with shorter\ntelomere length in patients with CHF for several reasons.\nFirst, the processes biological aging and renal senescence\nassociated with renal function decline includes a\ndecreased ability of aged nephrons to cope with diseased\nstates. CHF elicits systemic changes, including decreased\ncardiac output, inflammation, oxidative stress, and acti-\nvation of the renin-angiotensin system [4, 22]. Nephrons\nwith shorter telomeres might be less resistant to these\nchallenges and more likely to enter a senescence state,\nbecome dysfunctional or even apoptotic. The phenotype\nof human renal senescence has indeed been described\nTable 2 Univariate and\nadjusted standardized beta for\nassociation between renal\nfunction and telomere length\nModel 1: univariate; Model 2:\nadjusted for age and gender;\nModel 3; adjusted for age, age\nof heart failure onset, and\ngender\nNYHA New York Heart\nAssociation functional class,\nNT-pro-BNP N-terminal pro-B-\ntype natriuretic peptide, RAS-\ninhibitors renin-angiotensin-\nsystem inhibitors (angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme and\/or\nangiotensin-receptor blocker)\nStandardized-beta 95%CI P value\nModel 1 0.123 0.057\u20130.189 \\0.001\nModel 2 0.090 0.023\u20130.157 0.008\nModel 3 0.091 0.024\u20130.158 0.007\nModel 3\n?

Second, leukocytes telomeres mark\nreplicative history and therefore might mark the cumula-\ntive inflammatory burden a patient has been exposed to\n[1]. Inflammation is a major causal factor of vasculo- and\nglomerulopathy and consequently might cause a decrease\nin renal function. Finally, other factors associated with\nbiological aging (e.g., accumulation of advanced glyca-\ntion endproducts) might cause renal dysfunction and\ncoincide with shorter telomere length [20].\nThe cross-sectional nature of our study does not allow\ndrawing definite conclusions concerning the nature of the\nobserved association. Although we used multiple statistical\nadjustments, we cannot exclude possible confounding\nfactors that may have obscured the observed relationship.\nIn conclusion, decreased renal function was associated\nwith reduced leukocyte telomere length in patients with\nCHF. This observation support the hypothesis that\nincreased intrinsic biological age affects the kidney in its\nability to cope with the systemic changes evoked by CHF\nand might explain, at least in part, why renal function is\nclosely related to mortality in patients with CHF.\nAcknowledgments We like to thank all the patients, investigators,\nheart failure nurses, and the committees of the COACH-study (for\nnames see Ref.
