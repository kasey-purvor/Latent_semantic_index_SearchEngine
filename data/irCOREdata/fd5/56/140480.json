INTRODUCTION \n \nA fibre Bragg grating (FBG) consists of a periodic perturbation of the refractive index of the core of \nan optical fibre. FBGs are formed by exposure of pristine glass fibres to an interference pattern \nformed between intersecting UV laser beams. To achieve a high Bragg reflectivity, the \nphotosensitivity of the pristine fibre is enhanced either by doping the core with elements such as \nGe, or Sn [1], or by hydrogen-loading the optical fibre via immersion in high pressure hydrogen [2]. \nThe high pressure hydrogen-loading technique has been shown to achieve ultrahigh photosensitivity \nin GeO2-doped fibres [3]. Hydrogen loading is commonly used to allow FBG fabrication in \nstandard telecommunication optical fibres. \nFBGs are required to have a specific degree of mechanical robustness according to their \napplication. For instance, as sensors, the strain to failure should be higher than that of the measured \nobject to ensure that no sensor failure occurs before the failure of the object. Previous work [4] has \nshown that continuous-wave (CW) UV exposure can produce high-mechanical-resistance FBGs \nwith mean strength and m-values close to those of pristine optical fibres. However, a range of \npulsed lasers are also used in the fabrication of FBGs. Gratings can be written quickly and have \nbeen fabricated from a single laser pulse during the fibre draw process [5]. It has been reported that \n 3\nthe use of pulsed UV-irradiation to form FBGs degrades the mechanical strength [6, 7]. Varelas et \nal [7] reported that the median strength of UV irradiated fibres was around 50% of that of non-\nirradiated fibres. The total irradiation dose was found to have a limited influence on the mechanical \nstrength, which varied from 2.5 to 2.7 GPa when the total dose increased from 1.0 kJ\/cm2 to 3.0 \nkJ\/cm2. An investigation by Feced [8] revealed that the UV wavelength had an influence on the \nmechanical strength. In [8], the strengths of FBGs written using UV irradiation at 193 and 248 nm, \nat an average pulse intensity of 1.0 J\/cm2, were 0.84 and 0.69 GPa, respectively. Following on from \nthe work reported in [6], using laser wavelengths of 246 and 266nm, this paper examines the \ninfluence of key process parameters on the mechanical strength of irradiated fibres. These \nparameters include the pulse power, total dose and wavelengths of 246, 255 and 266nm.  \nFabrication of FBGs while the fibre is being drawn has demonstrated that high strength FBGs can \nbe produced [9]. No reduction in strength was observed when FBGs were written using a KrF \nexcimer pulsed laser of 248 nm at a pulse average intensity of 1.0J\/cm2 immediately after silica \nfibres were drawn and before the protective coating was applied to the fibres. The irradiated fibres \nshowed a median strength of 5.8 GPa. However, on-line FBG fabrication provides low reflectivity \nFBGs (less than 10%) [9]. The structural change of the irradiated fibres with low reflectivity may \nnot reach a threshold at which mechanical damage is caused. FBGs fabricated in hydrogen-loaded \nfibres have a higher reflectivity than those fabricated in non-hydorgen-loaded fibres under the same \nirradiation conditions [3]. It is not clear whether there is a relationship between the reflectivity and \nthe mechanical strength of FBGs. Previous research has shown no change in mechanical strength of \noptical fibres following hydrogen-loading [11]. However, no further work has been reported on the \nstrength of the hydrogen-loaded fibres that are subjected subsequently to the UV-writing process. \nThis paper determines the mechanical strength of FBGs using Ge-B codoped fibres with and \nwithout hydrogen-loading. Observation of the fracture surface, combined with the observation of \n 4\nthe surface morphology using an atomic force microscopy (AFM), enables possible mechanisms for \nthe reduction of the mechanical strength of optical fibre with different photosensitivities to be \nproposed.  \n \n2. FBG FABRICATION PROCESS \n2.1  Optical fibres and pre-processing preparation \nThe investigation was carried out using Ge-B-F doped photo-sensitive fibres (Fibercore PS1250). \nThe fibres are composed of a silica cladding and a core of 5% wt germania with boron phosphorus \ndoped-silica. They are single-mode fibres with a polyacrylate coating. The fibre has a cladding \ndiameter of 125 \u03bcm and a cut-off wavelength of 1250 nm. The polyacrylate coating is highly \nabsorbing in the ultra violet (UV) region of the spectrum, requiring removal of the coating prior to \nfabrication of the FBG. A 20 mm long section of the polyacrylate buffer coating was removed from \nthe fibre surface before the inscription of FBGs. The process of removing the coating reduces the \nstrength of the optical fibres to some extent, depending on the stripping method employed. In a \nprevious investigation [6], a chemical-solvent stripping method was determined to have the least \ndamaging effect, maintaining 80% of the strength of the pristine optical fibre. Therefore, this \nmethod was employed in this investigation. The fibres were soaked in the chemical solvent, and a \nlint-free tissue soaked with acetone was used to remove any coating residue.  \n \nSeven sets of fibres, each set comprising 15 fibre samples of a length of 300mm, were prepared \nunder the same conditions in order to determine the Weibull distribution of the fibre strength. The \ndetails of the sets of fibres and the processing parameters are listed in Table 1.  \n \n 5\nAmong all the sets, only set D was subjected to hydrogen loading prior to the coating removal and \nUV-irradiation. The fibres were placed in a steel chamber filled with hydrogen at a pressure of 120 \nbar. The hydrogenation took place for one week at room temperature.  \n \n2.2 UV-irradiation process \nThe fabrication of FBGs was accomplished by exposing the stripped section of the fibre to UV-\nbeams in the phase mask configuration [12]. The exposure parameters (the wavelength of light, \npulse energy and total exposure dose) listed in Table 1 were different for each set of fibres,. Three \nlasers were used with wavelengths of 246 nm, 255 nm and 266 nm. The specifications of the lasers \nare detailed in Table 2. Samples of the fibre that were not hydrogen-loaded were irradiated at the \nthree laser wavelengths, while the 255 nm irradiation was carried out on both the hydrogen and \nnon-hydrogen loaded fibres to compare the difference of the FBG mechanical strength. The FBGs \nfabricated using the 245 nm laser had the Bragg wavelength of 1300 nm determined by the period \nof the phase mask used, and the Bragg wavelength was 1320 nm for the FBGs inscribed using the \n255 and 266 nm lasers. The exposure time for each fibre was approximately 60s. \nThe reflectivity of the FBGs formed in the Ge-B-F doped fibre without H2-loading was in the range \n23-30%, while the FBGs formed in the hydrogenated fibres had a reflectivity of approximately \n60%.  \nAfter being processed, the fibres were kept in a desiccator (23\u00b0C, 26.5% RH) to protect the fibres \nfrom the effects of humidity, which has been shown previously to degrade the mechanical strength \nof optical fibres [13]. The time interval between the FBG fabrication and the mechanical testing \nwas 7 days.  \n \n 6\n2.3  Tensile tests and microscopic observations \nTensile tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical strength of the fibre sets listed in Table 1. \nIn the tensile test, the fibres were end-tabbed using cardboard tabs attached with a fast curing \nadhesive, to protect samples from failure within the grips of the tensile testing machine. The gauge \nlength of the samples was 160 mm while the total length of the fibre was 260 mm. The tensile tests \nwere performed on an Instron Model 6025 tensile testing machine with a load cell of 100 N \ncapacity. The tensile failure load was measured under a strain rate of 0.035\/min. \nIn each set of fibres, 15 specimen were tested. Tests were considered valid when fibres fractured \nwithin the gauge length. In practice it was observed that all of the fibres that had had their coating \nremoved fractured within the stripped section and that those which had also been UV irradiated \nfailed within the UV-exposed region. The tensile strength was then determined by dividing the \nfailure load by the area of fibre glass (assuming a constant diameter of 125 \u03bcm). The test \nenvironment was maintained at 23\u00b0C, and 55% RH. A two-parameter Weibull model was employed \nto analyse the strength distribution of each set of data. The Weibull modulus, m, is defined by: \nln( ln( ( ))) ln ln\u2212 \u2212 = \u22121 F m m\u03c3 \u03c3 \u03c3         (1) \nWhere F(\u03c3) is the cumulative failure probability at each stress level, \u03c3. The parameter, m, defines \nthe distribution scale of each set of measured data. \u23af\u03c3 is the strength at which 63.3% of samples fail \nwithin a set of fibres.  \nWhen a fibre broke into two pieces during the tensile measurement, the two fracture surfaces were \ncollected for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation. The fracture morphology was used \nfor analysing fracture mechanisms. Optical fibres that failed at high stresses were observed to \nshatter into small pieces so that fracture surfaces suitable for examination were not obtained.  \n 7\n \n3. RESULTS \nThe tensile test results which were analysed using the two-parameter Weibull model are \nsummarised in Table 3, showing the mean strength and the Weibull modulus. The mean strength of \nthe as-received fibres, with coating intact, was as high as 4.95 GPa. Following removal of the \npolyacrylate coating, the mean strength was reduced to 3.38 GPa. The mechanical strength was \nsignificantly reduced by the process of removing the coating. The width of the strength distribution \nincreased, with a corresponding decrease of the m-value from 66 to 3.1 as seen in Fig. 1 and Table \n3. Two previous investigations [4, 14] revealed no strength degradation when hot sulphuric acid \nwas used to strip the coating. However, the mechanical measurements were conducted immediately \nafter the stripping process. It has been found that the time lapse between the acid-stripping process \nand strength measurement has a major impact on the strength of stripped fibres [6]. However the \nfibres stripped chemically by the method used in this investigation showed little sensitivity to the \ntime lapse under a similar storage condition following 7 day storage in a desiccator. The \nchemically-stripped fibres retained 68% of their original strength, compared with a 50% strength \nloss by using the acid-stripping method. In contrast, measurements on Corning SMF 28 fibres \nfollowing chemical-stripping process showed a significant degradation with a mean strength of 0.92 \nGPa [8]. Hence, a large variation in the strength of stripped fibres may exist depending on what \nstripping method is used and how carefully the fibres are handled. \nStripped fibres that were subsequently UV-irradiated show a further reduction in the mean strength \nand a slight decrease in m-values. However the extent of UV degradation depends on the \nwavelength of the UV irradiation, and whether or not the fibre had been hydrogen-loaded, as seen \nin Table 3.  \n3.1  Influence of UV-parameters on the FBG mechanical strength  \n 8\nFigure 1 shows the failure stress of irradiated PS1250 fibres plotted against the cumulative failure \nprobability, comparing the strength of FBGs without hydrogen loading formed under irradiation at \nthe different wavelengths. The data points show scatter and are non-linear on the Weibull plot for \nthe UV-exposed fibres. If only one mechanism is responsible for the fracture of a material, the \nWeibull plot is expected to show a linear dependence of the failure stress on cumulative failure \nprobability, as is seen in the as-received optical fibres (Set A) in Fig. 1. In the as-received fibres, a \npolymer coating is applied just after the fibres are drawn, which ensures that no mechanical defects \nare introduced. In the process of FBG fabrication, defects of various sizes could be induced during \nthe coating removal and UV-irradiation, producing the wide distribution of the strength and non-\nlinear performance. \na) Wavelength vs. mechanical strength \nWhen plotting the mean tensile strength against the wavelength of the lasers which were used to \nfabricate the FBGs, an almost linear relationship is obtained as shown in Fig. 2. Exposure at shorter \nUV wavelengths appears to produce FBGs with greater mechanical strength (Set E) when compared \nto that obtained using the longer UV wavelengths (Set F). FBG fabrication at 246 nm (Set E) gives \nthe FBGs a higher mean strength than those exposed at 255 (Set C) and 266nm (Set F). The total \nenergy dose of the 255nm exposure (Set C) is more than 39 times that of 266 nm exposure (Set F), \nbut the strength of Set C fibres is 1.8 times higher than that of Set F fibres. It appears that the total \nexposure energy dose has little influence on the mechanical resistance while the laser wavelength \nproduces a significant effect. When Set F is compared to Set G, both of which were irradiated by \nthe 266 nm laser, Set F shows only 10% higher strength than Set G, even though the total exposure \ndose for the former set is 28% of the latter. Feced et al [8] reported a similar result where a higher \nstrength was achieved using the laser operating at 193 nm than that obtained using UV irradiation at \n248 nm for a pulse fluence of 1 J\/cm2. The FBGs had strengths of 0.84 GPa and 0.69 GPa, \n 9\nrespectively. The FBGs fabricated using the three wavelength lasers in this investigation show \nhigher strength than those reported in [8]. This could be because that the stripped fibres exhibited a \nstrength of 0.92 GPa prior to irradiation, significantly lower than that of the stripped fibres in the \npresent investigation (3.38 GPa).  \nb) UV pulse peak intensity vs. mechanical strength \nThe influence of peak pulse intensity on the mechanical strength is shown in Figure 3. Although the \nfibre sets were fabricated using different laser wavelengths, the general trend shows that an increase \nof pulse peak intensity reduces the mechanical strength. The exception is Set E which shows a \nhigher strength than that of Set C though Set E was fabricated using a higher peak pulse energy. \nThe poor mechanical resistance of FBGs fabricated at 266nm could be caused by both the longer \nlaser wavelength and the high pulse energy which is 3.5 times that of the 246 nm lasers and over 80 \ntimes that of the copper vapour system (255 nm). Hence it is difficult to distinguish between these \ntwo variables on the basis of the present results. However, the peak energy of a single pulse seems \nless influential than the laser wavelength in reducing the strength. Set E, fabricated using a 246 nm \nlaser, has a greater strength than Set C, fabricated using 255 nm in spite of the pulse peak intensity \nof the former laser being 20 times higher than that of the latter. This suggests that laser wavelength \nhas a more profound influence on mechanical strength than does the pulse peak intensity.  \n \n3.2  Influence of hydrogen loading on the FBG mechanical strength  \nAs shown in Table 3, UV-irradiation under similar conditions induced a strength degradation of \n36% for fibre Set C and 70% reduction for fibre Set D, which contained the same type of fibres but \nSet D had been hydrogen-loaded. To show the influence of hydrogen loading, the failure stress of \nthe irradiated fibres with and without hydrogen loading is plotted against cumulative failure \n 10\nprobability in Fig. 4. It is clear that hydrogen loading had a significant impact on mechanical \nstrength, the mean strength being less than 50% of that of the fibres that had not been hydrogen \nloaded. The power density and total energy dose used during the exposure of Set D, the hydrogen-\nloaded fibres, were lower than those applied to the Set C (not hydrogen-loaded), as seen in Table 3. \nLimberger et al [11] investigated the mechanical strength of Ge-doped photosensitive fibres both \nwith and without hydrogen-loading prior to UV-irradiation. Their results revealed a small \ndegradation of the mechanical strength, from 4.74 GPa to 4.62 GPa, along with a decrease in the m-\nvalue from 165 to 69, for fibres that were processed in H2 at 120 Bar for 16 months. However, no \ndegradation was observed when the fibre was loaded in H2 for two weeks. The short-term H2-\nloading process causes no reduction in the mechanical resistance of the fibre. However, this \ninvestigation shows that the mechanical strength of H2-loaded fibres is significantly reduced \nfollowing UV-irradiation.  \n \n4 Mechanical strength analysis from fracture surface observed by SEM  \n \nThe fibre fracture surfaces were observed under the SEM. If the optical fibres broke at a low stress \n(<1500 MPa), the fracture surfaces commonly showed a region of hackles radiating from a \nsemicircular region as seen in Fig. 5. This semicircular region consists of a mist zone and a mirror \nzone where a flat surface is seen. The radius of the mirror zone varied with the measured failure \nstress. High strength fibres showed a small mirror zone. When the failure stress is between 1500 to \n3000 MPa, the fracture morphology changed to a relatively flat surface without clear signs of a \nsingle crack initiation point, as shown in Fig. 6. No mirror zone is observed in the fracture surface \nin this case. The fracture surface shows a typical feature of a brittle material. When the failure stress \nwas above 3000 MPa, the fibres were shattered into small pieces and could not be examined. The \n 11\nfeatures of fracture morphology are related to the level of failure stress only, regardless of the \ntreatment conditions of optical fibres.  \n \nAn empirical relationship has been proposed by some investigators [15, 16] to correlate the mirror \nzone radius to the strength of glass fibres as: \n \n\u03c3f r1\/2 = C     (2) \n \nwhere: \u03c3f is the fracture stress of the fibre, r is the radial depth of the mirror zone, and C is a \nconstant \n \nA linear fit is expected when plotting \u03c3f against (r1\/2)-1.  Levengood\u2019s work [16] reported a linear \nrelationship between the depth of the mirror zone and the actual depth of the surface defect. The \nterm (r1\/2)-1, derived from the depth of mirror zone measured in H2-loaded fibres, is plotted against \nstrength in Fig. 7. The data points are located around a line. The linear regression fit to this line is \nobtained with a correlation coefficient of 0.85. \n \nSEM observations showed that 13 of the 14 failed specimens of the irradiated hydrogenated fibres \n(Set D) had a surface defect initiated fracture morphology. As seen in Fig. 4, apart from one fibre, \nall the failure stresses of hydrogenated fibres are below 1400 MPa. The exception exhibited a high \nfailure strength of 1540 MPa, showing no sign of surface defect initiated failure. From this, it is \nevident that surface defects are a dominant factor controlling fracture in UV irradiated \nhydrogenated fibres.  \n \n 12\nIn contrast, in the set of UV irradiated non-hydrogenated fibres (set C), only three out of 14 samples \nshowed signs that failure was initiated from the surface. These three fibres also had a failure \nstrength of less than 1400 MPa. The fracture surface shown in Figure 6 exhibits the features that are \nseen in most of the fractured non-hydrogen loaded fibres with a failure stress above 1400 MPa. \n \n5  Examination of UV-induced strength degradation using fracture mechanics \n \nThe SEM investigation revealed that the majority of the hydrogen-loaded fibres and some of the \nnon-hydrogen-loaded fibres inscribed with FBGs had fractures originating at the surface from a \ndefect of a size that is too small to be resolved in the SEM. AFM observations, reported in [17], \nhave shown that the writing of FBGs is accompanied by creation of surface corrugations on the \nfibre, oriented perpendicular to the axis of the fibre and with a period equal to 455 nm for the FBGs \nwritten using a phase mask with a period of 900 nm. Figure 8 shows a typical AFM image of the \nirradiated surface of a fibre inscribed with FBGs. The location of the surface troughs corresponds to \nthe location of the peak of the intensity of the interference fringes. It was found that the depth of the \ncorrugation increased with UV intensity and was significantly increased by hydrogen loading the \nfibres prior to FBG writing. It is conceivable that the corrugation depth may be related to size of \ndefects promoting failure in the fibre tensile tests.  \n \nThe relationship between fracture stress and defect size is governed by fracture mechanics. The \nfracture behaviour of glass fibres was originally investigated by Griffith [18], and his conclusions \non the role of defect and fracture energies have been subsumed into modern fracture mechanics. \nAssuming that the surface defects may be considered to be cracks, the relationship between fracture \nstress and defect size is given by  \n 13\na\nKIC\nf \u03c0\u03b2\u03c3 =   (3) \nwhere:  \n\u03c3f is fracture stress of the fibre \nKIC is a material constant, known as the fracture toughness of the material \na is the defect depth \nand \u03b2 is a geometrical constant \n \nThe surface troughs induced by UV-exposure may approximate to surface cracks. Thus the defect \ndepth in Eqn 3 is taken from the measured surface trough depth based on AFM observation. \nEquation 3 suggests that plotting fracture stress against inverse square root of defect depth should \nyield a straight line. Fig 9 shows a plot of mean failure stress against the defect depth of fibres from \nsets B, F and G. The 0.7 nm defect depth for Set B that was not UV-irradiated was the amplitude \nvalue of the AFM measured surface roughness. The corrugation depth for Set F was 1.7 nm \nmeasured from the AFM observation in the centre of irradiated region where the UV intensity is \nknown to be the highest. The depth for Set G was 6.1 nm, calculated from the relationship of the \ncorrugation amplitude and UV pulse intensity derived from the measured data in [17]. A linear line \nis obtained, suggesting that the changes in corrugation introduced by UV irradiation cause the \nreduction of fracture stress.  \n \nMore quantitative assessment can be made by assuming that the value of \u03b2 is 1.0, representing a \nsemi-elliptical crack configuration [19] and that the fracture toughness of glass fibres is 0.8 \nMPa.m1\/2 [20]. In Eqn 3, these values are then used to calculate the fracture stresses \u03c3f, with the \nmeasured corrugation depth as the defect depth. The result, also plotted in Fig. 9, shows that the \ncalculated fracture stresses are considerably overestimated by a factor of between 5 and 9. There is \n 14\nhigh confidence in the values of fracture toughness used and the value of the constant \u03b2 for this \ngeometry configuration. Hence it is likely that the errors lies in an under estimation of the defect \nsizes.  \n \nValues of defect depths necessary to produce the measured fracture stresses can be calculated using \nthe same expression (Eqn 3) by putting the measured fracture stresses into the equation lie between \n18 and 170 nm, which is approximately 25-80 times greater than the measured corrugation depth. \nThe discrepancy could arise from the fact that only a small area (10\u00d710 \u03bcm2) in UV irradiated area \nwas observed using AFM. More severe defects present in the rest of the irradiated area will not be \ndetected. The value of the corrugation depth used in the calculations and in Figure 9 is a mean value \nacross a 10 \u03bcm width, which is unlikely to represent the deepest defect that will initiate the failure. \nThe UV beam profile is not completely uniform resulting in local \u201chot spots\u201d which may introduce \nmore severe local damage. These local damage sites will become the defect initiating brittle failure. \n \nSecondly it is possible that the defect opening is so fine that the AFM cannot measure the true \ndepth, only the surface relief. In the FBG fabrication process, the high intensity UV interference \npattern creates the surface corrugation consisting of a series of compacted troughs. The process may \nalso produce cracks or defects which extend from the points of greatest corrugation depth into the \nfibre. The driving force for the cracks could be local thermal stresses, generated by the alternating \nbands of high and low temperature which the interference pattern will produce within the fibre. It \nmay also be due to the existence of stress concentration between the irradiated and non-irradiated \nbands.  \n \n 15\nDespite the discrepancy in the measured corrugation depth and the calculated defect sizes necessary \nto produce the observed failure stresses, changes in corrugation depth appear to represent the \nchanges in real defect size in their effect on fracture stress. Increased pulse power intensity and \nhydrogen loading of the fibres are observed to cause increased corrugation depth [17] and thus \ndecreased mean fracture stress.  \n \nIt seems likely that at the high intensity regions of the interference pattern, a process of photo \nablation could take place, locally removing the surface material along the interference fringe. Thus \nthe observed effect of increased laser intensity may be explained, which will increase corrugation \ndepth and decrease fracture stress. There may exist thermal stresses generated across the fringes \nwhich could aid a crack nucleation process. However, whether the effect of different laser \nwavelengths on the change of fracture stresses is linked to the change of corrugation depth is \nunclear, because the corrugation depth was investigated using the 266 nm laser only . \n \n \n4. CONCLUSIONS \n \n(1) Measurements of the tensile strength of batches of optical fibres containing FBGs produced \nusing laser wavelengths of 246, 255 and 266 nm and different peak intensities have \ndemonstrated that: \n(a) Mean fibre tensile strength is reduced from 3.38 GPa in the un-irradiated condition to a \nmaximum of 2.52 GPa after gratings are written. \n(b) Further decreases in mean strength to as low as 1.0 GPa are produced by increases in laser \npeak intensity, and increases in wavelength from 246 to 266 nm. \n 16\n(c) Hydrogen loading the fibres prior to grating inscription, causes reduction in peak tensile \nstrength from 2.16 GPa to 1.01 GPa for the same fabrication condition using the 255 nm \nlaser \n(2) Fracture surface observation using the SEM have revealed that fibres failing at stresses less than \n1500 MPa showed fractures indicating a single defect origin from the surface. \n(3) Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) of fibre surfaces after irradiation showed the presence of \nsurface corrugations with a period identical to that of the interference pattern used to form the \nFBG.  \n(4) A relation between inverse square root of corrugation depth and mean fracture stress has been \nfound, suggesting a fracture mechanics basis for the influence of the surface corrugation on \nmean tensile strength \n(5) Defect depths to produce observed strength are calculated to be between 25-80 times greater \nthan the observed corrugation depths. It is concluded that the mean corrugation depths represent \na population of defects whose extremes are the defects which cause failure.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe authors would like to acknowledge AEA Technology Plc and the Civil Aviation Authority, UK \nfor funding this project.
