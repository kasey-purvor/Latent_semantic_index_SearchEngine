It is \nparticularly valuable in addressing controversial questions such as the nature of early \nfarming communities in western Europe, in the period between the adoption of domestic \nplants and animals and the establishment, centuries or millennia later, of permanent \nvillages and regular field systems. In this article the demography of prehistoric Brittany \nis considered in the light of evidence presented by monumental tombs and stone settings, \nartefact distributions, palaeoenvironmental determinations and domestic remains. \nWhereas the megalithic monuments of Brittany are well known and have been the focus of \nsystematic research since the mid-19th century, relatively little attempt has been made to \nsituate them in their demographic context. The results of this study reveal that while \nBrittany is, like every region, unique in terms of climate, soils and social traditions, it \nshares several significant features of demographic patterning  \u2013  notably its cyclical \ncharacter  \u2013  with other regions of Neolithic Europe. This study also demonstrates how \nincomplete data sources can be used in combination to provide new interpretations of \nprehistoric demographic patterning and to frame new research questions. \n \n************************* \n \nThe adoption of farming and the demographic, economic and ideological changes that \naccompanied it remains one of the major research themes within the later prehistory of \nwestern Europe. While there is general agreement that the introduction of domestic plants \n 2 \nand animals altered forever the lifestyles of prehistoric communities, there is considerable \ncontroversy about the nature and rapidity of those changes. For some recent authors, the \ntransition from hunting and gathering to harvesting and herding was both relatively rapid \nand relatively complete (Schulting 2000; Richards & Hedges 1999). For others, the \nintroduction of the new domesticates was very gradual, and the impact of the Neolithic \nwas at first more at the level of material culture and ideology than at that of economy and \ndiet (Thomas 1991). \n \nThe gradualist view gains support from the relatively late dating in Britain of developed \nagricultural systems which include field complexes and permanent villages. The presence \nof early Neolithic field systems in western Ireland (Caulfield et al. 1998; Cooney 2000) \ndoes not alter the fact that for southern Britain, a period of some two and a half millennia \nelapsed between the first introduction of domesticates and the beginnings of what may \naccurately be described as settled agriculture. The vision of a mobile Neolithic can be \nextended to other parts of the Atlantic fa\u00e7ade. For most of Atlantic Europe extensive \nevidence for permanent settlements begins only in the Later Bronze Age (Bradley 1997, \n30). \n \nIf settled agriculture is a late development, there is a need to define more closely the \nnature of West European societies in the period from the introduction of domesticates to \nthe point at which fixed farming became widespread. We may perhaps expect these \nsocieties to conform neither to the classic village-farming model nor to a model of \nmodified hunting and gathering in which a handful of domesticates have been adopted. \nThe character of a mobile Neolithic is likely to be something familiar in certain respects  \n\u2013  and these may find analogues in the ethnographic literature   \u2013  but unfamiliar in its \noverall configuration. It must in addition be recognised that the diverse geography of \nwestern Europe will have elicited varied responses region by region in terms of mobility, \nscale and social organisation. Hence we must look not for one single pattern, applicable \nacross the whole of western Europe, but for a diversity of social and cultural expressions, \n 3 \nand diverse economic and settlement formulations. In short, we might expect to encounter \nin western Europe not one uniform Neolithic but many variant Neolithics.  \n \nWestern Europe ends in a series of promontories which project into the Atlantic Ocean. \nThe name \u201eland\u201fs end\u201f applied to three of these (Cape Finisterre in Galicia, the Finist\u00e8re \nd\u00e9partement of Brittany and Land\u201fs End in Cornwall) highlights their geographical \nposition. Characterised by rocky outcrops, thin and acidic soils and high rainfall, these \npeninsulas are very different from such classic settings for early European agriculture as \nthe loess lands of central Europe. Thus the populations inhabiting the western peninsulas \nof Europe will have adopted different social and demographic patterns in accepting the \nnew domesticates. One such response may have been the construction of monumental \ntombs and megalithic stone settings. Some have attributed the origin of these monumental \nconstructions to the pressure placed on indigenous coastal communities by the expansion \nof farming groups from the east (Renfrew 1976). Such models, however, assume \nrelatively high densities of population for whom competition for resources was a key \nissue. This assumption demands fuller investigation in the light of available evidence.  \n \nThe aim of the present article is to consider the Neolithic demography of just one of these \nwestern peninsulas: Brittany, at the north-western corner of France. Famous for its \nmegalithic monuments, including passage graves, stone rows and megalithic art, Brittany \nhas been a focus of archaeological research since the middle of the 19th century. Its \nprehistoric settlement record, however, is poorly understood. The paucity of house plans \nthat can be dated to the Neolithic period highlights the questions of population density \nand settlement mobility that have been outlined above. A recent analysis of published \nevidence for Neolithic settlements in Brittany found only 35 confirmed Neolithic \nexamples, and most of those were assigned to the Late Neolithic (H\u00e9naff 1999). An \nexception is the trapezoidal house plan at Le Haut M\u00e9e, dated to c.4700 BC (Cassen et al. \n1998). This represents the extension of the Early Neolithic long house tradition from \ncentral Europe to the eastern border of Brittany, but has as yet no other Breton parallels. \nOn the other hand the group of massive long houses at Pl\u00e9ch\u00e2tel, south of Rennes, with \n 4 \nradiocarbon dates in the range 2870-2460 BC (Tinevez 1995; Giot et al., 1998, 386-88), \nfalls firmly within the Late Neolithic. Other Neolithic settlement evidence consists only \nof surface scatters, or material (with occasional post-holes) sealed beneath excavated \nburial mounds (L\u201fHelgouach 1976; Cassen & L\u201fHelgouach 1992). None of these give \nindications of substantial buildings. To complete the picture, we may add the scanty \nevidence of settlement within enclosures, again mainly Late Neolithic in date (Scarre \n2001a).  \n \nAt first sight, the inadequacy of the settlement record makes Brittany a curious candidate \nfor a study of Neolithic demographic patterning. On the other hand, Brittany is far from \nalone in the scarcity of substantial settlement evidence and the difficulties which that \nscarcity presents. Furthermore, if the settlement patterns of the Neolithic period were \nindeed mobile and insubstantial, the surviving evidence will be likewise insubstantial. \nAbsence of house plans may be precisely what should be expected. It is necessary \ntherefore to assess whether the nature of the evidence is indeed testimony to the character \nof the occupation and not, as is sometimes assumed, a product of destruction or \ninadequate research. Finally, the prominence of monuments in Neolithic Brittany  \u2013  their \nnumber, their clustering and distribution, and their overall scale  \u2013  can only properly be \nunderstood in the context of demography and social organisation.  \n \nThe study presented here is thus both an essay in understanding the prehistoric \ndemography of a specific region of western Europe, and a methodological exercise, \nexploring how far it is possible to reconstruct demographic patterns and sequences from \nthe typically incomplete evidence available to archaeology. For Brittany, the key \ncategories of evidence are the distribution and chronology of the major monuments, the \ncontribution of surface collections and field surveys, the distribution of stray finds \n(notably polished stone axes), and the information of a rather different kind provided by \npalynology. Here the vegetational sequences recovered from inland and coastal peats \nmake a significant contribution to the overall picture of human impact. Each of these \nsources of information comes with its own particular limitations. In combination, \n 5 \nhowever, they present a largely coherent picture of regional Neolithic demography. This \nnot only provides an essential foundation for understanding the Neolithic of Brittany but \nhas implications for the character of Neolithic settlement and society in western Europe \nas a whole. \n \nThe archaeological background \n \nWith an indented coast and a geological structure dominated by schists and granites, \nBrittany is similar in character and geology to Galicia or the south-western peninsulas of \nBritain. Though cereal agriculture was present in Brittany by the 5th millennium BC, the \nsoils and climate are not especially conducive to cultivation. The long coastline, which \nhas always lent itself to marine exploitation and maritime coastal movement, may all the \nmore readily conjure the image of mobile Neolithic fishermen moving from bay to bay in \na systematic and structured exploitation of marine resources. The contrast between the \nabundance of monuments and the scarcity of settlements, however, makes such images \ndifficult to ground in the archaeological record. Is the apparent scarcity of settlements \nsimply a factor of lack of research? Or is the Breton Neolithic really a story of many \nmonuments but rather few people? \n \nPrevious accounts have tended to envisage relatively substantial populations. Giot, for \nexample, has estimated that the Mesolithic population of Brittany may have been \nnumbered in thousands, rising to 25,000-50,000 in the Middle Neolithic (5th-4th \nmillennium BC), and 50,000-100,000  \u2013  or even 200,000-300,000  \u2013  by the end of the \nNeolithic (3rd millennium BC) (Note 1). In terms of distribution across the landscape, \nGiot writes of \u201cembryons diffus de zones quasi-urbaines\u201d in areas of dense activity such \nas the southern Morbihan, and elsewhere of \u201cpetites communaut\u00e9s de quelques dizaines \nd\u201fhabitants\u201d (Giot in Giot et al. 1998, 451-2). Such estimates inevitably pose the question \nof evidence and its destruction. Taking Giot\u201fs middle figure of 50,000 inhabitants, for \nexample, and averaging it over the chronological span of the Neolithic in Brittany (some \n2000 years), gives us a total number (assuming an average lifetime of 30 years) of well in \n 6 \nexcess of 3 million people. The difficulty is to assess whether the pattern of evidence \nwhich survives is really testimony to such a large population, or whether, as will be \nargued below, we should think in terms of much smaller numbers. \n \nGiot also discusses the distribution of monuments in relation to population, and the \nevidence of settlement scatters. Here he takes a more cautious line, pointing to the scale \nof destruction and the relative unsuitability of local material inland for the construction of \nmegalithic tombs. He concludes \u201cLorsque l\u201fon peut tenter d\u201fy appliquer des tests \nstatistiques, il semble qu\u201fil soit exceptionnel de pouvoir obtenir des valeurs significatives \nmontrant qu\u201fune distribution spatiale n\u201fest pas au hasard.\u201d Yet he feels sufficiently \nconfident to conclude in the next paragraph that during the first half of the Neolithic, \n\u201ctoutes les activit\u00e9s se sont certainement maintenues de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 du littoral, \net dans des zones de petites plaines et plateaux c\u00f4tiers\u201d; whereas in the Late Neolithic \u201cil \ny a effectivement une occupation plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du pays avec beaucoup plus de petites \ncommunaut\u00e9s dispers\u00e9es dans l\u201fint\u00e9rieur\u201d (Giot in Giot et al. 1998, 453-4). \n \nThis is the classic interpretation of Neolithic settlement history in Brittany. It directly \nparallels the distribution of chambered tombs, where Middle Neolithic passage graves are \nlargely confined to a zone within 30 kms of the coast; whereas Late Neolithic all\u00e9es \ncouvertes, though still heavily coastal in distribution, also indicate an expansion of \npopulation inland (Fig. 2). The point has been made and reinforced by a series of authors \n(Daniel 1960; Giot 1960, 1981; Le Roux 1984a). \n \nOne may question, however, whether the chambered tombs  \u2013  monumental funerary \nmonuments  \u2013  can so readily be assumed to provide a reliable indicator of population \ndistribution. They relate to particular social and ritual practices which need not have been \nshared equally by all communities. Furthermore, the patterns of monuments plotted on \ndistribution maps must be recognised as a palimpsest of successive construction, use, \nabandonment and re-use. The distributions are the product of cumulative individual \nevents whose historical reality is entirely masked by the division of the period into large \n 7 \nundifferentiated blocks such as \u201eMiddle Neolithic\u201f or \u201eLate Neolithic\u201f, each of them \nlasting around a millennium. Such considerations are all the more significant if we seek \nto understand the dynamics of the population. In that context, what might at first sight \nappear as a crude two-phase sequence (an initial coastal emphasis followed by expansion \ninland) could indeed conceal a historical sequence of multiple  expansions and \ncontractions of population from one or more \u201eheartlands\u201f or reservoirs occupied on a \nmore permanent basis. \n \nTo summarise, the issues behind this demographic enquiry may be broken down as \nfollows:  \n \u2022 in the first place, the scale of the population, not in absolute numbers, but in \nterms of an order of magnitude \n \u2022 secondly, whether the distribution of that population is well represented by the \ndistribution of material evidence (in terms of sites, finds and monuments) \n \u2022 and thirdly, the dynamics of that population, during a Neolithic which extends \nfrom the mid 5th millennium BC to the mid 3rd millennium BC, a period of 2000 years \nor some eighty generations. \n \nThe Finist\u00e8re pattern \n \nTraditional models of the Neolithic assumed that full-scale agriculture was quickly \nestablished and that population levels rose rapidly and significantly. The alternative \nmodel of a relatively mobile Neolithic suggests lower population levels, and opens the \npossibility of greater continuity with the preceding Mesolithic. On the other hand, the \nconstruction of substantial Neolithic monuments indicates if not a change in community \nscale then at least a change in social and ritual practice. \n \nFor many years, the study of the Breton Mesolithic was dominated by major coastal sites \nsuch as T\u00e9viec and Ho\u00ebdic, or the more recently excavated Beg an Dorchenn and Beg er \nVil (Kayser 1992). Since 1989, however, a programme of systematic field-walking of \n 8 \ninland areas has revolutionised knowledge of Mesolithic settlement distribution, and has \ndemonstrated that coastal sites form only one element of the pattern. In Finist\u00e8re, the \nmost important Mesolithic sites lie in a band some 20 kms from the present coast, and \nthere are further significant sites some 40-50 kms from the present coast (Fig. 3) \n(Gouletquer et al. 1996). Thus the Finist\u00e8re pattern  \u2013  with the major Mesolithic sites \ninland  \u2013  contrasts with the dominant position occupied by coastal sites in the Mesolithic \nsettlement of regions such as Denmark. Particularly revealing has been the study of \nMesolithic sites in the area south of Morlaix. While it is impossible to demonstrate which \nof these sites are strictly contemporary, movement of raw materials between them \nsuggests Mesolithic territories occupying blocks of land between parallel river courses \n(Fig. 3).  \n \nThe hierarchy of Mesolithic sites is consonant with a pattern of structured seasonal \nresidential mobility (cf. Binford 1980; Kelly 1992). Each block of land, its edges defined \nby parallel river valleys and its northern limit by the coast, may have been occupied by \nsmall family-sized groups who came together for certain periods of the year at larger sites \nsuch as Le Clos or Mika\u00ebl (Fig. 3). The main axis of movement in these narrow elongated \nblocks of territory would have been north-south, between coast and uplands, and beyond \nthe uplands down into the valley of the River Aulne to the south. Smaller sites such as \nGlahar\u00e9, Plourin-Bourg or Goabizien probably represent the remains of short-term \nencampments for individual family groups, as do sites on the coast. The latter was \nparticularly important as the only source of flint, in the form of beach pebbles \n(Gouletquer et al. 1996). What binds these locations together into a single system is the \nevidence for the movement of lithic raw materials: notably ultramylonite from Mika\u00ebl and \nchalcedinous microquartzites from Le Clos, carried perhaps in the course of seasonal \ncycles to smaller settlements lying to north and south.  \n \nThus Mesolithic groups moved regularly in mobile patterns of resource exploitation \nbetween coast and uplands. In this respect, the succeeding Neolithic period marks a \nsignificant break. Surface sites can reliably be assigned to period (Late Mesolithic, Final \n 9 \nMesolithic, Neolithic) on the basis of the lithic types (notably the arrowheads) which they \ncontain (Gouletquer et al. 1996, 12; see also Marchand 1999). Analysis of these \nassemblages reveals that there are no Final Mesolithic sites on the north coast of \nFinist\u00e8re, and no Neolithic sites in the interior. The most prominent Neolithic presence is \nthe chambered tomb of Barnenez constructed on a coastal promontory, and dated to the \n5th millennium BC (Giot 1987). There are also Neolithic lithic scatters on this coast. It is \nindeed possible that the inland sites assigned to the Final Mesolithic were contemporary \nwith the earliest Neolithic on the coast. If so, any such overlap must have been of \nrelatively short duration. The Mesolithic communities would have found their territories \ntruncated by the arrival of Neolithic colonists; ultimately, they may have been absorbed \nby Neolithic groups. There is nothing to support the model of an ongoing \ncomplementarity of land-use and lifestyle (as demonstrated for example by the Batak of \nthe Philippines: Eder 1984) beyond, at most, the very earliest Neolithic. Inland, the \nsettlement record appears to stop with the Final Mesolithic, to be resumed only with the \ngeneral settlement of inland Brittany in the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age. \n \nBarnenez to Brasparts \n \nThe Neolithic occupation of northern Brittany was not only largely coastal in character \nbut also locally discontinuous. Pollen from the palaeosol beneath the Barnenez cairn \nindicated land clearance at or before the time when the multiple passage grave was built. \nThere is evidence for cultivation: Marguerie notes the presence in the Barnenez samples \nof \u201ctaxons typiques de milieu anthropis\u00e9\u201d and, in one case, cereal-type pollen (Marguerie \n1992, 119). Analysis of pollen from palaeosols beneath other early north-coast passage \ngraves at Ile Carn and Ile Guennoc indicated that these monuments, too, had been built in \nalready cleared landscapes, with some cereal pollen present in both cases. On the other \nhand, a short core from the coastal marsh at Le Guerzit just to the south of Barnenez went \nback to early 5th millennium BC (Gif-7614: 5950\u00b1110 bp = 5190-4540 BC) and was \ndominated by bracken spores (Marguerie 1992, 123) (Note 2). We should also note the \nthree phases of clearance before 5000 BP (but no cereal pollen) established by Morzadec-\n 10 \nKerfourn\u201fs analysis of coastal peat at Chardons Bleus (on the north coast of Finist\u00e8re \nsome 50 kms west of Barnenez) (Marguerie 1992; Morzadec-Kerfourn 1974). Thus along \nthe north coast of Brittany, while evidence from palaeosols shows that monuments such \nas Barnenez and Guennoc were constructed in cleared landscapes with some local cereal \ncultivation, the nearby pollen cores indicate that uncleared landscape was still dominant, \nwithout any indication of widespread cultivation. Only in the 2nd millennium BC does \nthe pollen record indicate extensive clearance of vegetation in northern Finist\u00e8re, with the \nfirst evidence of cereal pollen in pollen cores (Marguerie 1992, 236). \n \nThus pollen evidence does not suggest that the clearance and cultivation episode \nrepresented by the Barnenez palaeosol was either very extensive or very long-lived. \nWhether this duration should be envisaged in terms of decades or centuries is open to \nquestion. The chronology within the Barnenez monument itself can be broken down into \nat least three stages: the first of them represented by the decorated menhir which was \nincorporated into the passage of passage grave J (L\u201fHelgouach 1997); the second and \nthird by the two principal phases of construction identified by Giot\u201fs excavation (Giot \n1987). The whole sequence may indeed be considerably more complex than this, but it is \npossible that we are dealing with a period of at most a few centuries, somewhere in the \n5th millennium BC. Activities at Barnenez may hence have lasted only a few generations, \nand been followed by a long period when this locality was effectively abandoned. \n \nTo the west of Barnenez, the settlement of Curnic may illustrate the nature of Neolithic \noccupation on this coast. Here eroding out of the beach a number of stone-built hearths \nwere excavated, the associated material spanning a lengthy period (both Middle and Late \nNeolithic vessel forms and lithics) (Giot et al. 1965), with radiocarbon dates from the \nearly 5th millennium BC to the later 4th millennium (Note 3). Rather than a continuously \noccupied settlement, however, the Curnic site is best interpreted as the product of a small \nnumber of successive short-lived occupations, in a location which at the time must have \nstood a little way back from the sea-edge.  \n \n 11 \nSome 25 kms inland from Barnenez, the Montagnes d\u201fArr\u00e9e form a natural barrier \nseparating the coastal zone from the interior. In this inland region there is gap in \narchaeological evidence between the Final Mesolithic (sites including Presqu\u201file and \nKerbizien: Gouletquer et al. 1996), and the Late Neolithic (V-shaped passage grave of \nTy-ar-Boudiged; lateral entry grave of Creac\u201fh Niver; all\u00e9e couverte of Mougau-Bihan: \nL\u201fHelgouach 1965). These Late Neolithic funerary monuments conform to the \u201elate \nsettlement\u201f model for the Breton interior. Yet it is hard to believe that the region was \nentirely unoccupied for a period of 1000 years from the end of the Mesolithic to the \nbeginning of the Late Neolithic. A pollen core from the peat bog of Yeun Ellez, at the \nfoot of Mont-Saint-Michel de Brasparts, did indeed yield a single cereal pollen grain \n(Triticum) from section 18 of the core, dated 5400\u00b160 bp (GrN-198: 4360-4040 BC) \n(Van Zeist 1964). This may suggest limited, occasional cultivation as early as the 5th \nmillennium BC, but there is no further cereal pollen in the Saint-Michel-de-Brasparts \ncore until the 3rd millennium BC, and even then (only two grains of Triticum pollen) it \ndoes not mark the beginning of a continuous cultivation record.  \n \nIn the absence of other evidence the single pollen grain cannot represent an agricultural \nrevolution (cf. Monk 1993, 40). On the other hand, a pattern of occasional, short-term \nforays by small groups growing the occasional cereal crop, unaccompanied by widespread \nor lasting impact on the vegetation cover, is perfectly possible. It would confirm the \nmarginal or ephemeral nature of this earlier Neolithic activity, and  suggest that although \npeople continued to pass through the area, their primary activities were centred \nelsewhere: perhaps on the north coast, though we have seen that there, also, the record of \nNeolithic occupation is discontinuous. It may be, therefore, that these patterns of \nexploitation can be understood only at a broader geographical scale, within the context of \ndemographic fluctuation and movement across Neolithic Brittany as a whole. \n \nThe Plussulien axe quarry \n \n 12 \nAgainst this background the apparently prolonged and intensive activity at the axe quarry \nat Plussulien demands to be reassessed. This quarry is located in the south-western corner \nof the C\u00f4tes-d\u201fArmor d\u00e9partement deep within the interior of Brittany. Investigations \nfrom 1969 to 1976, coupled with radiocarbon dating, distinguished four phases of \nexploitation (Le Roux in Giot et al. 1998, 482-89; Le Roux 1984a; 1999a). The first of \nthese was dated to the late 5th millennium, and hence belongs to an early phase of the \nNeolithic. During this preliminary exploitation, the groups who visited Plussulien \nexploited blocks of dolerite which had already split away from the parent material, and \nthey dug pits into the clay matrix to extract fragments of dolerite. The technology, \ninterestingly enough, was not dissimilar to that used in the shafts of the flint mines of \nnorthern France and the Low Countries. In the second phase at Plussulien, beginning \naround the third quarter of the 4th millennium BC, activity intensified with the use of \nmauls, picks and wedges to exploit the parent rock directly, breaking off blocks weighing \nup to a tonne. The third phase, in the Late Neolithic, saw the introduction of fire-setting \nagainst the outcrops to facilitate the fracturing of the rock. Finally, the axe quarry went \ninto decline, and appears to have fallen out of use around 2000 BC (Le Roux 1984a; \n1999a). \n \nThe evidence from Plussulien poses a number of questions about the settlement of central \nBrittany. From the amount of flaking debris which survived, Le Roux estimated that 6 \nmillion axes had been produced at the site. Le Roux argued that the production of axes \nled to the establishment of a permanent specialist community at Plussulien from an early \ndate, turning out between 300 and 3000 axes per year over a 2000-year period. This level \nof productivity would in his view have required a permanent community of 30 specialist \nworkers, which corresponds to a community size of 2000-3000 (Le Roux 1999a). (Note \n4) \n \nThis scenario is difficult to reconcile with the known incidence of Neolithic sites and \nmonuments in the Plussulien area (Fig. 4). The quarry site is located in a basin around the \nheadwaters of the Rivers Blavet and Oust. The higher ground around the edge of this \n 13 \nbasin is marked by a series of menhirs and chambered tombs. To the north, near Saint-\nNicolas-du-P\u00e9lem, there are surface scatters of Neolithic material thought to represent the \nremains of settlement sites, notably on the Coll\u00e9dic plateau, but the majority of the \nmaterial is Late Neolithic, and only in one case (at Kergoubleau) were possible Middle \nNeolithic sherds recovered. The promontory settlement of Toul-Goulic at Tremargat, to \nthe west of Saint-Nicolas-du-P\u00e9lem, also has only Late Neolithic occupation (Le Roux \n1984a; 1999a; Le Provost et al. 1972; Le Carduner et al. 1992; Briard et al. 1997). \n \nThis pattern of Late Neolithic activity is supported by the chambered tombs of the \nPlussulien area. These fall within Late Neolithic categories (notably all\u00e9es couvertes and \nlateral entry graves), and are dated to the 3rd or early 2nd millennium by radiocarbon \ndates from Liscuis II and III and Kerivoelen (Le Roux 1984a; 1999a). Indeed, apart from \nthe Plussulien quarry itself and the Middle Neolithic sherds from Kergoubleau, the only \nevidence of earlier Neolithic presence in the area is a charcoal concentration in front of \nLiscuis I which gave a late 5th\/early 4th millennium radiocarbon date (Le Roux 1984a) \n(Note 5). \n \nIn sum, what we appear to have at Plussulien is an axe quarry extensively worked since \nthe 5th millennium BC, with virutally no evidence of contemporary burial monuments or \nsettlements for at least another thousand years. The absence of settlement evidence (Le \nRoux 1999a, 206: see Note 6) strongly suggests that the quarry was worked not by a \npermanent specialist community, but by groups travelling from more permanently settled \nregions. In terms of access, it should be noted that the two principal rivers of the \nPlussulien basin  \u2013  the Blavet and the Oust  \u2013  flow southwards towards the Morbihan \ncoast. The Blavet, indeed, leaves the basin through a steep-sided gorge, and it is on either \nside of this that the late Neolithic communities built the Liscuis and Kerivoelen \nchambered tombs. The cluster of tombs may indicate that this gorge had particular \nsignificance to the Neolithic communities, and we may speculate that this significance \nderived in part from its character as the beginning of the route leading to the settled areas \nof the south coast. \n 14 \n \nA parallel may be drawn with the early phase of exploitation at the Neolithic axe quarries \nof Plancher-les-Mines in the Vosges, where occasional expeditions by groups from \nvillages some 30-40 kms away are envisaged (P\u00e9trequin & Jeunesse 1995). This may be \ncompared with the distance of 30 kms from Plussulien to the south coast of the Morbihan. \nOnly in the Late Neolithic period do settlements appear close to the Plussulien quarries, \nperhaps associated with the fire-setting operations of phase 3 (Le Roux 1999a). Here \nagain there is a parallel with Plancher-les-Mines, where around the turn of the 5th\/4th \nmillennium BC new villages were established much closer to the quarries, at a distance of \n18-20 kms. For the greater part of its active use, however, Plussulien is most likely to \nhave been exploited by special task groups periodically making the two- or three-day \njourney from their settlements to restock their supplies of axe material. \n \nDistributional evidence \n \nThe evidence from north Finist\u00e8re and from the Plussulien area provides a provisional \nbasis for modelling the character and distibution of Neolithic settlement in Brittany. To \nascertain whether this model may be applied across the whole of the peninsula, however, \nit is necessary to consider other categories of evidence. These fall under three heads: \nartefacts (notably polished stone axes), palynology, and monuments. Systematic field \nsurveys of surface materials would provide a fourth strand, but have yet to be undertaken \nin many areas of Brittany. Those surveys which have been published focus exclusively on \nthe coastal zone (Le Page 1993) or are concerned primarily with material of other periods \nand make only passing reference to prehistoric evidence (e.g. Tanguy 1988; Davies & \nAstill 1994).  \n \n1. Polished stone axes \nPolished stone axes are the most numerous category of Neolithic artefact in Brittany and \ncome from both chance finds and excavations. Plussulien dolerite provides the majority \nof the material but a number of other sources are represented. The distribution of axe \n 15 \nfinds is sufficiently widespread to be of considerable significance in defining the pattern \nand nature of Neolithic activity. Le Roux has studied the sourcing and distribution of \n3257 non-flint polished stone axes (Le Roux 1999a). The average density of distribution \nis 0.11 axe per km\n2\n but a high proportion of the finds come from coastal districts, with \nmany areas of the interior virtually devoid of axes. A study of the distribution maps for \neach of the Breton d\u00e9partements illustrates the coastal emphasis of the distribution, an \nemphasis which continues east and south into Loire-Atlantique and Vend\u00e9e (Le Roux \n1996, figs. 162-167; here combined in Fig. 5). This recent work reaffirms and \ncomplements earlier observations that the highest frequency of polished axe finds was in \nthe southern coastal districts, most notably the southern Morbihan and the south-western \npeninsula of Cornouaille. So striking was the distribution that in some coastal districts, \nalmost every field has yielded polished stone axes (Cogn\u00e9 & Giot 1952). \n \nTwo exceptions to the predominately coastal emphasis of axe distribution should be \nnoted. The first is in southern C\u00f4tes-d\u201fArmor, at and around the quarry site of Plussulien. \nSince over half of the Breton polished stone axes are of type A dolerite from Plussulien, \nsuch a concentration is not surprising and relates to exploitation of the quarry rather than \nto permanent Neolithic settlement of this region.  \n \nThe second inland concentration lies to the west of Rennes, and here a different \nexplanation must be sought. It is indeed likely that the Rennes area was a significant \ninland population centre during at least the later stages of the Neolithic. To the polished \naxe distribution may be added the enclosure sites in the valleys to the east of Rennes such \nas La Trappe at Boistrudan and La Charronni\u00e8re at Saint-Aubin-des-Landes (Leroux \n1992). The evidence suggests, however, that these enclosures are of Late Neolithic date, \nand some of the axe material may also be Late Neolithic (the exploitation of the \nPlussulien quarries, for example, continuing as we have noted down to c.2000 BC: Le \nRoux 1999a). The poor chronological resolution of the polished axe distributions is one \nof their principle limitations; while each findspot represents either chance loss (Giot in \nGiot et al. 1998, 452) or intentional deposition (cf. Bradley 2000,120), and hence a single \n 16 \nshort-term event, the overall distribution is by nature a palimpsest in which chronological \nprocesses are largely indistinguishable. \n \n2. Pollen and vegetation \nPollen evidence provides further information on the character of Neolithic occupation and \nhuman activity across Brittany. Dominique Marguerie has combined new analyses with \nolder studies to provide an overview of the impact of human communities on the Breton \nvegetation from the Neolithic to the historical period. The information comes from two \nprincipal sources: first, pollen cores from peat bogs, both around the coast and in the \ninterior;  and second, pollen from the palaeosol preserved beneath Neolithic and later \nmonuments (Marguerie 1992). \n \nThis evidence shows that large-scale forest clearance in most areas of Brittany was \nrelatively late in date, falling within the late 2nd or 1st millennium BC (Late Bronze \nAge\/Iron Age). The patterning, however, is especially revealing for the nature and spread \nof Neolithic occupation. The one exception to late clearance is the area of the southern \nMorbihan, where both pollen cores and palaeosols indicate intentional burning and partial \ndeforestation as early as the Middle Neolithic. There is also frequent pollen evidence for \ncereal cultivation. At coastal sites such as Petit-Mont at Arzon, beside the entrance to the \nGolfe du Morbihan, pollen and soil micromorphology both imply clearance and probably \ncultivation for a substantial period before the construction of the Middle Neolithic \npassage graves (Marguerie 1987; 1989; 1992; Gebhardt 1993; for Petit-Mont see also \nScarre 2000). \n \nOn the north coast, by contrast, while palaeosols show that monuments such as Barnenez \nand Ile Guennoc were constructed in cleared landscapes with some cereal evidence, \npollen cores from adjacent peat bogs indicate that uncleared landscape was still dominant, \nwith no trace of cultivation. The conclusion must be that the north coast clearances were \nlimited in scale, and perhaps temporary. Only in the southern Morbihan was forest cover \n 17 \ncleared on a significant scale. Finally, evidence from the Breton interior shows that dense \nforest cover prevailed (Fig. 6). \n \nBy the 3rd millennium BC, settlement of the interior is reflected in both monuments and \nvegetation. Good evidence comes from palaeosols beneath a series of Late Neolithic and \nEarly Bronze Age burial mounds in the For\u00eat de Broc\u00e9liande (Marguerie 1989). Here the \npollen evidence suggests that the Neolithic monuments were established within a semi-\ncleared forest landscape, with little evidence of intense human activity. By the Bronze \nAge, the forest cover had been further cut back, but more significant is the evidence for \nlarger areas of grassland and weeds of cultivation. Indeed, in inland Brittany, a true \nagrarian landscape does not develop until the Late Bronze Age or later (Marguerie 1992). \n \nThus the pollen evidence suggests that earlier Neolithic population was concentrated in \nthe  southern Morbihan. We can perhaps be even more precise, and confine this to \nCarnac, Locmariaquer and the Golfe du Morbihan; certainly pollen evidence from the \nVilaine estuary suggests that significant clearance did not begin there until the Middle \nBronze Age (Marguerie 1992). Earlier Neolithic settlement of the interior appears to have \nbeen at best only slight in scale, whereas along the north coast it was confined to pockets \naround a few major monuments. The Late Neolithic expansion into the interior does not \nappear to have been heavily dependent on crop cultivation but did involve some clearance \nof vegetation. It may represent mobile, forest-farming communities exploiting extensive \nterritories focused on the all\u00e9es couvertes. Evidence from the Paris basin and north-\neastern France also suggests a spread of settlement at this period associated with mobility \nand dispersal, the tombs forming a fixed point in the landscape and incorporating human \nremains of a series of distinct kin groups (Scarre 1983, 1984; Masset 1997; Masset & \nValentin 1999). \n \n3. Monuments \nThe final category of evidence is that of the Neolithic monuments, including both \nchambered tombs and standing stones. The former have already been discussed, the \n 18 \npredominantly coastal distribution of the Middle Neolithic passage graves (5th\/4th \nmillennium BC) succeeded by the more general distribution of the all\u00e9es couvertes and \nother Late Neolithic (4th\/3rd millennium) tomb-types (Fig. 2). The standing stones take \nthe form of arcs and a alignments (notably the famous alignments of Carnac in southern \nMorbihan), and of single stones known as \u201emenhirs\u201f. \n \nThe widespread distribution of menhirs contrasts with that of earlier Neolithic passage \ngraves, menhirs being present in almost every region of Brittany, coastal or inland, often \nof substantial size or in some abundance. Giot (in Giot et al. 1998, 531-2) estimates the \nsurviving number of menhirs at between 1100 and 1200, with the greatest frequency in \nthe three western d\u00e9partements of Morbihan, Finist\u00e8re and C\u00f4tes-d\u201fArmor. \n \nIt was long believed that many of the Breton menhirs should be dated to the Late \nNeolithic or the Bronze Age (3rd\/2nd millennium BC). In recent years, however, the \nevidence for incorporation of decorated menhirs in passage graves has indicated an earlier \norigin for some at least of these standing stones (Le Roux 1984b; L\u201fHelgouach 1983; \n1997). At Locmariaquer, five radiocarbon dates for the occupation horizon associated \nwith the Grand Menhir Bris\u00e9 and with a dismantled alignment of menhirs fall within the \nrange 4350-3390 BC (L\u201fHelgouach 1997). We may conclude that these decorated \nmenhirs belong to the period before 3500 BC, when many of them were systematically \nuprooted and incorporated in passage graves. \n \nThere is evidence that undecorated menhirs were also being erected as early as the fifth \nmillennium BC. This is suggested by radiocarbon dates from Saint-Just ( Briard et al. \n1995, 54-56; Le Roux et al. 1989), and by the relation of certain coastal menhirs to lower \nsea-levels (Giot 1990). Equally, it is clear that undecorated menhirs continued to be \nerected during the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, and probably later (e.g. radiocarbon date \nfrom Monteneuf: Lecerf 1999; menhirs associated with tin sources: Le Roux 1999b).  \n \n 19 \nThus the decorated menhirs appear to share the coastal emphasis of the passage graves. \nThe undecorated menhirs, by contrast, are also found in inland Brittany and appear to \ncontradict the archaeological and palynological evidence indicating low levels of human \nactivity inland during this period. The inland menhirs may however represent the \nsacralisation of an uncleared landscape, beyond the limits of cultivation or of regular, \nsustained frequentation. At Saint-Just, the stone settings on and around the Gr\u00e9e de \nCojoux are associated with a series of surface scatters marking Neolithic occupation sites. \nThese occupations were probably transitory in nature and could be the product of \npilgrimage-type events; material found at Saint-Just indicates strong and repeated links \nwith the south coast of the Morbihan (Scarre 2001b). The menhirs may hence be \nillustration of another aspect of Neolithic population mobility, serving as the focus of \noccasional ritual attention by communities coming together from adjacent areas, \nincluding the coast; they do not necessarily betoken dense, permanent settlement of these \ninland locales. \n \nEstimating populations from monument size \n \nFrom the evidence presented above it could be argued that the Neolithic population of \nBrittany was smaller than has hitherto been supposed, and may largely have been \nclustered around the coast. Estimates of population size, however, must also take account \nof the labour demands posed by major structures such as the Carnac stone rows or the \nGrand Menhir Bris\u00e9. Here we need at once to distinguish between the cumulative product \nof a monument constructed of relatively small elements  \u2013  such as a stone cairn, however \nlarge  \u2013  and the erection of massive stones which might individually weigh several tens \nor even hundreds of tonnes. A large mound such as the Tumulus de Saint-Michel at \nCarnac, measuring some 120m by 60m at the base, and still standing 10m high, represents \nan enormous undertaking by any reckoning. In theory, however, it could have been \nconstructed by a small group of people working over many years. It is clear, indeed, that \nmonuments of this kind attained their final shape only as the result of multiple phases of \nbuilding and remodelling. There is nothing to demonstrate unequivocally that the size of \n 20 \nthe workforce need at any point have been greater than the number needed to move and \nerect the largest slab. \n \nThe manipulation of massive individual stones, by contrast, does impose a minimum size \nof workforce. Modern estimates are however subject to considerable uncertainty. A 32-\ntonne replica capstone that required a team of some 200 local people (170 pulling, and 30 \nmore operating levers) to move in a 1979 experiment (Mohen 1989, 176ff) has recently \nbeen moved by a mere 10 people using socketed levers (Poissonnier 1998). We cannot \ndetermine that socketed levers were ever actually employed by Neolithic communities, \nbut the contrast in size of workforce indicates that the communities responsible for these \nmegalithic monuments may have been very much smaller than has often been supposed. \n \nWe are still left with the problem of truly enormous Breton monoliths such as the 280-\ntonne Grand Menhir Bris\u00e9 (Fig. 7). This may have been quarried at an exposure of \northogneiss at Treulen, some 10-12 kms north of Locmariaquer, and probably travelled \nmost of the distance by water, strapped within a massive timber raft (Le Roux 1997). \nLarge forces would still have been needed to pull the menhir from quarry to water\u201fs edge \nand again from water\u201fs edge to erection site; one estimate suggests a minimum of 500 \npeople pulling on ropes. Raising it into a vertical position would have been exceedingly \ndifficult and may have required still greater resources of human muscle-power. \nFurthermore, while the Grand Menhir Bris\u00e9 is the largest of the south Morbihan menhirs, \nthere are nine more that weigh between an estimated 30 and 100 tonnes (Le Roux 1997). \n \nThe moving of massive monoliths such as these would require the gathering together of \nlarge numbers of people. The southern Morbihan, however, is the one area of Brittany \nwhere there is evidence of a relatively substantial and continuous Neolithic population. \nThe 500 people needed to drag the Grand Menhir Bris\u00e9 to and from the water\u201fs edge may \nnot all, of course, have lived in the Golfe du Morbihan area on a year-round basis. This \nmassive feat of prehistoric engineering may represent the result of several seasonal \ngatherings, drawing people to this important ritual centre from across southern Brittany. \n 21 \nA radical view might even suggest that these 500 people  \u2013  multiplied perhaps by two, \nthree or four to include children, the infirm and others who did not participate in the work  \n\u2013  may have represented the greater part of the regional population during the Neolithic \nperiod. The analogy of the Nuer prophet\u201fs mound, described by Evans-Pritchard, may be \nappropriate here; built by a vast gathering of people over a period of three years, it \nbecame a cult centre attracting people from a distance of over 300 kms (Whittle 1997a, \n149). \n \nThe special importance of the southern Morbihan is demonstrated by both the number of \nmonuments and their size, including the massive Carnac mounds, the long rows of \nstanding stones (the Carnac alignments), and the heaviest and tallest of all Breton \nstanding stones: the Grand Menhir Bris\u00e9. This importance may have been based on the \nregion\u201fs sanctity and ritual associations. The trade of salt from the shallow and shelving \nedge of the Golfe du Morbihan could have been an alternative or additional source of \nlocal power (Cassen & P\u00e9trequin 1999). Numerous as they are, the monuments of the \nregion represent discrete and discontinuous constructional events; there is no reason to \nbelieve that every generation engaged in major projects. Yet at the same time it is hard to \nbelieve that the occupation of this region was discontinuous. Even if salt and sacrality \nhave been over-emphasised, the proximity of the sea, the evidence for early cereal \nagriculture (from the 5th millennium BC; the 7th millennium dates quoted by Visset et al. \n1996 must be regarded with caution), the long-horned cattle engraved on the Gavrinis \ncapstone (Le Roux 1984b) and the cattle buried beneath the Er-Grah long mound (Le \nRoux 1998) suggest a diverse range of local resources, sufficient for a significant \npermanent population. The evidence from the southern Morbihan stands apart from that \nfor the remainder of Brittany in its continuity. \n \nEthnographic parallels \n \nThe evidence assembled here allows us to propose a new understanding of the nature and \nhistory of prehistoric occupation in Brittany during the Neolithic period. The new picture \n 22 \nresults not so much from new information as from the insights provided by considering \nthe various categories of information together. The essential basis is the attempt to \nquantify, to achieve an understanding of scale. This is difficult enough, given the nature \nof the evidence available. Labour estimates may suggest the minimum number of people \nrequired to construct a substantial stone monument, but that does not indicate the actual \nnumber of individuals who were involved in the work, nor the size or composition of the \nsocial group responsible for the undertaking. Yet the impression provided by such a \nbottom-up approach, focusing on individual sites and monuments, begins to gain \ncredibility when combined with a top-down approach which reviews the broad-scale \nevidence for human occupation, in terms of palynology and axe, tomb and menhir \ndistributions across the peninsula as a whole. \n \nThe twin keys to understanding the demography of Neolithic Brittany are mobility and \nfluctuation. Mobility must be invoked to explain the pattern of non-intensive activity \nacross much of the peninsula during these millennia; fluctuation explains the breaks in \noccupation of many areas. \n \nSettlement mobility has long been recognised as a feature of hunter-gatherer societies, \nespecially those where foraging rather than collecting was the basis of subsistence \n(Binford 1980; Kelly 1992). Intensification through competition for resources has been \nargued to explain the shift to sedentism in some societies (Rafferty 1985). In the case of \nBrittany, however, continuity from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic is problematic; \narguments for such continuity in the artefact record have found little support in recent \nstudies (Marchand 1999). This applies even to the Gulf of Morbihan, where shell \nmiddens with formal burial structures have been cited as possible prototypes for the \nmonumental megalithic tombs of the following Neolithic (Case 1976; Scarre 1992). The \nlithics, on the other hand, indicate a clear break between Mesolithic and Neolithic, and \nthe survey evidence shows abandonment of the Mesolithic settlement pattern in western \nBrittany and its replacement by a new, coastally-focused Neolithic pattern (Marchand \n1999; Gouletquer et al. 1996). It is tempting to argue that the change in settlement pattern \n 23 \nis directly connected with new subsistence practices introduced at the beginning of the \nNeolithic period, associated with cultivation and animal husbandry. Cattle early take on a \nsymbolic importance in the Breton Neolithic, as demonstrated by the cattle burials at Er \nGrah in Brittany and the carvings at Gavrinis and Locmariaquer referred to above.  \n \nTo place this in anthropological context, we may perhaps consider the kinds of mobility \nsuggested by the archaeological evidence. Kelly (1992) and Whittle (1997b) have both \nemphasised that neither sedentism nor mobility is a simple concept; each covers a range \nof behaviours. Whittle distinguishes six variants along a spectrum from residential or \ncirculating mobility characterised by short-stay camps, through logistical or radiating \nmobility (with seasonal movement and base camps) and various kinds of short-term \nsedentism, finally to \u201eembedded sedentism\u201f with generation-on-generation residential \ncontinuity (Whittle 1997b, 21). Kelly evokes a mosaic-type pattern of varying degrees of \nmobility among groups or individuals within a society, coupled with change over time: \n\u201cAs some people reduce their residential mobility, others may continue to be residentially \nmobile, perhaps developing a mutualistic relationship with sedentary villages\u201d (Kelly \n1992, 50). Kelly further points out that sedentism is not always an irreversible threshold, \nbut that societies may fluctuate between more and less sedentary behaviours (Kelly 1992, \n49-50). \n \nBoth Whittle\u201fs and Kelly\u201fs perspectives suggest appropriate ways of modelling the \nBreton settlement evidence. As we have seen, pollen evidence demonstrates that even in \nthe \u201emarginal\u201f areas such as the north Finist\u00e8re coast and the inland basin of Saint-\nMichel-de-Brasparts, cereal cultivation was practised during the earlier Neolithic. The \ndifficulty of assessing such evidence for early cultivation (Monk 1993) should not lead to \ndismissal of the likelihood that Neolithic communities throughout Brittany were \nconversant with agricultural practices. That agriculture in itself does not imply sedentism \nis amply illustrated by the ethnographic examples of the Rar\u00e1muri of Mexico, many of \nwhom move seasonally to farm scattered fields some distance from their primary \nresidence (Hard & Merrill 1992); or the Batak of the Phillipines who combine agriculture \n 24 \nwith the collection of wild resources and with trade (Eder 1984). Agriculture and mobility \nare hence not mutually exclusive, and some degree of mobility may explain the scarcity \nof house plans or evidence of widespread forest clearance in Brittany during the earlier \nNeolithic.  \n \nAt the same time, the degree of mobility involved may be questioned. Timescales for the \nBreton Neolithic are generally approximate in character and what appears as a short-term \nevent  \u2013  cereal pollen in a lake core, or the construction of a monument  \u2013  may have \nextended over several generations. Major multi-phase monuments such as the Barnenez \ncairn most likely span several generations, and may have stood at the centre of a \nsettlement pattern of frequent residential relocations   \u2013  seasonal movement \nencompassing both agricultural activity and some exploitation of marine resources. \nAlongside these short-term cycles should be placed the evidence for longer-term cycles, \nincluding the apparent cessation of agricultural activity in many of these areas after a \nperiod of years or decades. That must imply the contraction of settlement in certain \nperiods to more restricted areas of permanent settlement, notably on the southern edge of \nthe peninsula. \n \nThus the seasonal movement or short-term sedentism characterising most of Brittany in \nthe earlier Neolithic must be inscribed within a longer-term cycle of population dispersal \nand aggregation. It is clear from North American examples such as the burial mound \n(dated to c.7500 bp) at L\u201fAnse Amour on the Strait of Belle Isle in southern Labrador that \nmonument-building is not the exclusive preserve of agricultural communities (McGhee & \nTuck 1975, 85-94; Tuck 1976, 36-44). The number and size of Breton Neolithic \nmonuments should not therefore lead to assumptions of settled and populous \ncommunities save where other evidence is available to support such a contention. Such a \ncondition may hold for the southern Morbihan. The Rar\u00e1muri case is interesting in this \nregard in that some families  \u2013  those with sufficient farmland close at hand  \u2013  avoid the \nneed for seasonal movement and are also able to draw on a larger labour pool (Hard & \nMerrill 1992). This confirms the view that more sedentary populations will have greater \n 25 \nability to engage in large communal endeavours. In the Brittany context, the implication \nwould be that sedentary populations along the south coast were most capable of building \nlarge monuments, a point consistent with the exceptional work-effort needed to raise the \nlargest Breton monoliths such as the Grand Menhir Bris\u00e9.  \n \nWe may thus reconstruct the picture as follows. During the course of the 5th millennium \nBC (if not during the preceding millennium), new technologies of food production (both \ncultivation and animal husbandry) made their appearance in Brittany. Their adoption \nbrings disruption to pre-existing Late Mesolithic settlement patterns in at least some \nareas, with a new concentration of activity around the coast. The southern Morbihan \nbecomes a primary demographic and ritual focus, and resident populations undertake \nmajor projects such as the raising of huge monoliths (some bearing images of the \nsymbolically-important domestic cattle) and (perhaps a little later) the construction of \nenormous Carnac mounds. The size of these mounds and the richness of their contents (in \nterms of axes and beads) has led to the proposal of \u201esouth coast chiefdoms\u201f in this context \n(Bender 1985). Axes and beads of Alpine jadeite and Pyrenean variscite testify to the \nlong-distance connections of these high-status communities (Cassen & P\u00e9trequin 1999; \nVillalba et al. 1986), though in the absence of preserved skeletal remains the number and \nstatus of individuals buried within these tombs is open to more than one interpretation. \n \nAlongside the import of exotic materials went the exploitation of indigenous Breton \nresources, notably the dolerite of Plussulien. The Plussulien area is devoid of settlement \nor burial evidence from the earlier Neolithic, but the quarry itself was exploited from as \nearly as the last quarter of the 5th millennium BC. Theories of a specialist axe-producing \ncommunity manufacturing and exporting dolerite axes at Plussulien are not borne out by \nthe evidence which instead suggests that this was a focus of visits by task groups from \nother areas. Here again mobility is underlined. The quantity of dolerite axes in the \nsouthern coastal zone suggests that small groups from that zone may regularly have made \nthe journey north, entering the Plussulien area via the dramatic Daoulas gorge before \nmaking their way across to the quarry site. The long-established quarry site would have \n 26 \nbeen immediately and abundantly evident from the massive quantities of quarrying debris \nlittering the slopes around the dolerite outcrop (Le Roux 1999a). \n \nFor the remainder of Brittany, comprising the greater part of the peninsula, the evidence \nis concordant with a pattern of nested cycles of mobility at different temporal scales. The \npermanent nature of the major monuments does not imply large populations or \ncontinuous exploitation over hundreds or thousands of years. Nor does evidence of \nagriculture (itself only scattered) indicate invariant sedentism. Ethnography and \narchaeology combine to support a model of settlement that incorporated a significant \nmeasure of mobility. On the coast, intermittent settlement of particular locales was \nassociated with cereal cultivation and tomb construction. Inland, axe finds and menhirs \ntestify to occasional visits or journeys. In sum, limited mobility associated with greater \nsedentism along the south coast compares with short-term settlement events in other \nfavoured (mainly coastal) zones, and contrasts with much greater mobility  \u2013  and a more \nfleeting cultural signature  \u2013 in the interior. Alternating episodes of occupation and semi-\nabandonment complete the picture. \n \nA final element in this pattern is suggested by the scale and number of the monuments in \ncertain areas, above all the kilometre-long multiple stone rows and Carnac mounds of the \nsouthern Morbihan. Such monuments may have been intended to serve more than simply \nlocal concerns, and it is possible that they served as aggregation centres for populations \ndispersed through large areas of the Brittany peninsula. Aggregations of this kind  \u2013  \nperhaps seasonal, or once every several years  \u2013  fit readily with the pattern of high \nmobility outlined above. Indeed, if we regard southern Brittany as a reservoir for \nNeolithic populations, then many of the groups inhabiting other parts of the peninsula \nmay have traced their origins back to the southern coastlands.  \n \nComparative perspectives \n \n 27 \nFor comparison with the Breton evidence we may consider two regions of western \nEurope for which detailed evidence of Neolithic settlement is available. Though much \nsmaller in scale than the Brittany peninsula, they do provide snapshots of Neolithic \nsettlement in contrasting environmental and cultural settings. \n \nThe first of these is the Combe d\u201fAin in the Jura d\u00e9partement of eastern France. This \nenclosed alluvial valley in the Alpine foothills is occupied by two lakes (Chalain and \nClairvaux) around whose shores a series of Neolithic and Bronze Age villages were \nestablished. Waterlogged preservation of buried timbers and systematic excavation over \nthree decades have provided an unparalleled view of the development of these small \nvillage settlements. Particularly well-studied is the period 3200-2900 BC, which has been \ndivided on dendrochronological evidence into a sequence of 20-year phases. Clusters of \nvillages were built during this period at west end of Lake Chalain and the north end of \nLake Clairvaux, rising from a single village on each lakeshore in 3180 BC to a maximum \nof nine in 2980 BC. \u201cDuring this time span, the size of the small villages was nearly \nconstant . . . with, on average, a dozen rectangular houses, of 8 to 10 metres long and 4 \nmetres wide and as many little cereal granaries.\u201d (P\u00e9trequin et al. 1998, 184). From 2980 \nBC the development went into reverse, and the number of villages declined once again, \nuntil the area was largely abandoned once again by around 2900 BC. Short-term climatic \nchanges appear to be a major driving force in this sequence (Arbogast et al. 1996). \n \nWithin this short cycle of colonisation and abandonment, study of cereal pollen and of the \ntimber used for house construction has allowed a reconstruction of the human impact on \nthe environment. P\u00e9trequin and his colleagues divide the sequence into two parts: before \n3000 BC, when slash-and-burn agriculture in a forest environment was practised; and \nafter 3000 BC, when denser settlement led to increased pressure and clearance of the \nforest, and permanent fields and grazing areas were established in an open environment \n(P\u00e9trequin et al. 1998). This change is accompanied by faunal evidence indicating a sharp \ndrop in hunting c.2980 BC, as population pressure intensified (P\u00e9trequin et al. 1998, \n189). In the next cycle of settlement, between 2800 and 2600 BC, human impact on the \n 28 \nforest cover stabilised, and the length of occupation of the villages increased. This leads \nto the conclusion that the agro-pastoral system had become much more stable, with much \nlarger cleared areas (P\u00e9trequin 1996, 15). \n \nA striking feature of the evidence is the pulse-like nature of Neolithic occupation around \nthe Lakes Chalain and Clairvaux, as P\u00e9trequin and colleagues (P\u00e9trequin 1996; Arbogast \net al. 1996; P\u00e9trequin et al. 1998) have emphasised: \n \n\u201cTwenty years of multidisciplinary research . . .  have shown that the flattest shores of \nLakes Chalain and Clairvaux were occupied , though not with real permanence, by small \ncommunities of farmers and stockherders during the 5th-3rd millennia BC . . The Combe \nd\u201fAin experienced periods of direct colonization, coming alternately from western \nSwitzerland and the Rh\u00f4ne Corridor, and periods of partial or complete abandonment. . . . \n[T]his region of low mountains . . . probably served as a zone of welcome for \ncommunities coming from rich agricultural zones, who were trying to regulate \nmomentary problems of overpopulation by reproducing the same social organization and \ntechnology, as long as new lands were still available.\u201d (P\u00e9trequin 1996) \n \nThe Combe-d\u201fAin, in the Alpine foothills, is in many ways a marginal area in the \nestablishment of cereal farming communities in western Europe, as demonstrated by the \nlate arrival of farming settlement in the valley. By contrast, the middle\/lower Rhine, and \nmore specifically the Bandkeramik occupation of the Merzbach Valley on the \nAldenhovener Plateau, is a key region for understanding the development of early \nfarming societies in western Europe. Systematic excavations have revealed evidence of \n160 house plans from eight distinct settlement sites, plus three enclosures and a cemetery, \nbelonging to the period 5300-4900 BC. Each settlement comprises one or more \nlonghouses, these being massive timber structures upto 70m in length. Successive \nlonghouses were built to replace each other in the same location, each such sequence \nforming a settlement module termed a Wohnplatz or Hofplatz. Langweiler 8, the longest-\nlived of these settlements, spanned 14 successive house generations, representing an \n 29 \nuninterrupted occupation of some 400 years (L\u00fcning 1998). Langweiler 8 is also the \nlargest of the Merzbach settlements, with 11 contemporary longhouses at its greatest \nextent. The Bandkeramik settlement of the Merzbach Valley as a whole grows from three \nhouses in the first phase to a total of sixteen or seventeen houses in phases VII and XII, \nthen falls away rapidly to only three houses in phase XIV and none in phase XV (Stehli \n1989).  \n \nThe agricultural basis for these Bandkeramik settlements is reconstructed as small-scale \ncereal cultivation in fixed plots close to the settlements (Stehli 1989; L\u00fcning & Kalis \n1993). This follows on from work by Modderman (1971), Kruk (1980) and Rowley-\nConwy (1981) which demonstrated the weaknesses of the earlier model of Bandkeramik \nshifting slash-and-burn agriculture (e.g. Clark 1952, 96-97; Soudsky & Pavlu 1972). Land \nmay have been cleared for agriculture by burning off the vegetation, but the abundance of \nweed seeds suggests that fields were in use for sufficiently long periods that persistent \nweed communities could become established (Bogucki & Grygiel 1993, 312). \nBandkeramik faunal assemblages are dominated by domestic cattle (Bogucki & Grygiel \n1993, 409). For the Merzbach valley, Stehli paints a picture of limited cultivation around \nthe settlements, with relatively little clearance of the forested hinterland (Stehli 1989). \nThe substantial nature of the houses, the evidence for long-term continuity and \nreplacement of houses in the same locations, the arguments for fixed-plot farming and the \nlow incidence of hunted animals together imply both low residential and low logistical \nmobility. The importance of cattle in the faunal record, however, has been used to argue \nalternative models of greater mobility, on the grounds that viable herds would require \nmore extensive pastures and therefore demand higher levels of movement. This may \nindeed have been the case in certain regions, as for example the Polish lowlands (Bogucki \n1987), where Bandkeramik residential mobility may have been the norm. Arguments that \nsuch residential mobility would have characterised Bandkeramik settlement in other areas \n(Whittle 1996, 160ff; Thomas 1996a, 100ff) demand serious consideration, but have yet \nto win general acceptance. We may for the present characterise the pattern as one of low \n 30 \nresidential mobility and low logistical mobility, with cultivation of cereals in small plots \nadjacent to the long house clusters (Fig. 8). \n \nConclusion \n \nThis analysis indicates that the pattern of Neolithic settlement proposed above for \nBrittany is paralleled in certain respects, and to different degrees, in other areas of \nwestern Europe. Perhaps most striking is the discontinuous nature of occupation, \nconsonant with the hypothesis of low population levels, subject to cyclical fluctuations on \na scale of two to four centuries. Cycles of colonisation and abandonment might have been \nexpected in agriculturally marginal zones such as the French lakes, and perhaps even \nBrittany with its relatively poor soils, but it is more surprising to find them a feature even \nof \u201ecore\u201f areas of early Neolithic settlement such as the Aldenhovener Plateau. Such \ncycles may have been relatively common throughout prehistoric western Europe, and will \nundoubtedly have had major impact on patterns of cultural transmission (Shennan 2000). \n \nAn emphasis on residential stability is suggested by the visibility and durability of the \nsettlements discovered in the Combe d\u201fAin and on the Aldenhovener Plateau, though the \nAldenhovener evidence may be interpreted in other ways. What is very clear is that the \nsettlement evidence from Brittany is much weaker, with only a single substantial house \nplan (from Le Haut M\u00e9e: Cassen et al. 1998) currently attested for the earlier Neolithic \nperiod. The Brittany evidence bears closer comparison with that from southern Britain, \nwhere there are few well-documented earlier Neolithic house plans, and those structures \nthat have been found may be interpreted in other than purely domestic terms (Darvill \n1996; Thomas 1996b; Whittle 1997b; but see also Cooney 1997).  \n \nThe model proposed for Brittany hence differs more in degree than in kind from that for \nother areas of western Europe during the earlier Neolithic. The distribution of passage \ngraves and other prominent Neolithic monuments does not indicate a pattern of settlement \nwhich remained fixed and stable over hundreds of years. Instead they should be \n 31 \nrecognised as representing a palimpsest of individual historical events, and any attempt to \n\u201eaverage\u201f these patterns will inevitably obscure the short-term fluctuations in both scale \nand distribution of population which must lie behind them. \n \nThe model of Neolithic demography developed in this study is necessarily an \nextrapolation  from evidence both partial and incomplete. It has been necessary to \ngeneralise from specific examples and contexts to construct an interpretation  relevant at \nthe level of the region as a whole. In this way the information available from surface \nsurveys  \u2013  around the Plussulien axe factory, for example, or the Rade de Morlaix and its \nhinterland  \u2013  has been applied in the guise of a general model. It is important to recognise \nthe limitations and potential inaccuracies of this approach.  \n \nIn the first place, it is always possible that future fieldwork will bring new information to \nmodify or negate the interpretation presented here. This we might label the research state \nerror. Second, it is already clear that within this region of Brittany, individual areas depart \nsignificantly from the general configuration proposed. Some of these variations, such as \nthe density of sites in the southern Morbihan, may indeed be considered parts of the \nmodel itself; others, such as the number of inland sites in the Rennes basin, fit less easily. \nThis may be termed the geographical variability error: the tendency for general models \nderived from incomplete evidence to ignore or under-emphasise the significance of \nlocalised patterns that fall below a certain spatial scale.  \n \nA third type of error is intrinsic to the use of information combined from different \nsources: evidential incompatibility. In the case outlined above the most notable \nincompatibility lies between the palynological evidence for widespread and long-lived \nforest cover, and the distribution inland of certain categories of material culture, such as \nundecorated menhirs or polished stone axes. If the menhirs indicate the sacralisation of \nmarginal landscapes, the polished stone axes could represent intentional votive deposits \nin forested areas, but it could also be argued that the palynological evidence has been \nover-emphasised at their expense. A final source of error is presented by what we may \n 32 \ncall the palimpsest effect, that we are looking at distributions which are cumulative in \ncharacter and for which in general we have poor chronological control. The patterns \navailable for analysis are the product of many small-scale events and human actions  \u2013  \nwhether it be the group-based construction of a megalithic tomb, or the more episodic \nloss or deposition of a polished stone axe in wooded terrain.   \n \nFinally we must return to consider what light this study throws on the nature of Neolithic \ncommunities in western Europe. It was observed earlier that these communities were at \nleast partially dependent on domesticated plants and animals, but had not yet (save in \ncertain limited areas) developed fixed field systems or permanent settlements. The \nevidence presented above suggests that cyclicity was a crucial element of the pattern. We \nmay envisage small-scale communities comprised of perhaps a single household or a \ngroup of households settling in one location for a generation or more. There they \ncultivated cereals and raised domestic livestock in what remained, throughout the \nNeolithic period, a largely forested environment. \n \nWe may conclude that the landscapes of Neolithic western Europe were not densely \npopulated. Concentrations of population may well have been present in certain areas, \nthough it is difficult from the available evidence to determine whether these were stable \nfeatures of the demographic pattern or whether they too fluctuated in density according to \na cyclical pattern. One possibility is a succession of episodes of contraction and \nexpansion: periods when population was dispersed throughout the region alternating with \nperiods when settlement was concentrated within \u201ecore\u201f zones (cf. Shennan 2000). Such a \npattern would open new perspectives on the significance of durable cultural markers such \nas monuments. Such monuments might in this context have served as permanent \nreminders of areas once settled but now abandoned. The particular nature of the \ndemographic pattern may thus be at the basis of the west European monumental tradition. \n \nThis is an unashamedly minimalist interpretation of the evidence. Large and impressive \nmonuments do not automatically equate with substantial and prolific  populations. The \n 33 \nlocalised evidence for Neolithic cultivation should not lead to assumptions of dramatic \ngrowth in population levels during the early Neolithic. The impressive Neolithic \nmonuments may be misleading, in their size, as pointers to the nature of the societies that \nbuilt them, which were perhaps dispersed, small-scale and impermanent. The monuments \nbelong not to a landscape of fixed farming communities but to an earlier phase of \ntransitory, mobile cultivation. Here Neolithic Brittany may be an example of the general \ncharacter of early farming societies in western Europe as a whole. \n \n \nNotes \n \n(1) The Neolithic of Brittany is conventionally divided into three stages  \u2013 Early, \n Middle and Late  \u2013  of which the Early Neolithic is represented by very few sites \n or finds and is generally absent over the greater part of the peninsula (the site of \n Le Haut M\u00e9e in the north-east being a notable exception). The Middle Neolithic \n may be dated to the period 4500-3500 BC, and the Late Neolithic to 3500-2500 \n BC. \n \n(2)  All radiocarbon dates are calibrated to the 2 sigma range; calibration figures \n taken where possible from the BANADORA database (Base Nationale des \n Donn\u00e9es Radiocarbone) established by the Centre de Datation RadioCarbone, \n Universit\u00e9 de Lyon. \n \n(3) Stone-built hearth 5980\u00b1145 bp (Gsy-47B: 5250-4505 BC); charcoal from \n upper layers of the buried soil produced dates as late as 4600\u00b1200 bp (Gsy-\n 47A: 3780-2710 BC). \n \n(4)  Le Roux (1999a) estimates that the Plussulien quarries must have produced \n between 1 million and 2 million usable rough-outs during 2000 years of use, at \n a rate varying perhaps between 300 and 3000 axes per year. Assuming that each \n 34 \n axe took between 1 and 3 days to complete, Le Roux calculates that the \n exploiting population must have been of the order of 2000 to 3000 (30 people \n involved in producing axes full-time; food surplus limited to maximum of 5%, \n indicating a total adult population of 500; converts to 2000-3000 if one includes \n infants and children). \n \n(5)  Liscuis II:  Gif-3585: 4170\u00b1110 bp =  3020-2460 BC \n Liscuis III: Gif-4076: 4200\u00b1110 bp =  3040-2470 BC \n   Gif-4075: 3680\u00b1110 bp =  2450-1745 BC \n Kerivoelen:  Gif-3586: 3680\u00b1110 bp =  2450-1750 BC \n   Gif-3587: 3640\u00b1110 bp =  2320-1690 BC \n Liscuis I:  Gif-3099: 5140\u00b1100 bp = 4220-3705 BC \n \n(6) Le Roux argues the opposite, that there must have been such a settlement and \n that the absence of surviving traces much be explained by erosion and the  effects \nof cultivation. \u201cA la diff\u00e9rence de carri\u00e8res situ\u00e9es en zone montagneuse  . . . il \u00e9tait \npossible de travailler en permanence \u00e0 Plussulien tout en r\u00e9sidant au  voisinage \nimm\u00e9diat.
