On the other hand, there are also concerns \nthat social networking increases the likelihood of new risks to the self, these centring \non loss of privacy, bullying, harmful contacts and more. This article reviews recent \nfindings regarding children and teenagers\u2019 social networking practices in order to \nidentify implications for future research and public policy. These focus on the \ninterdependencies between opportunities and risks, the need for digital or media \nliteracy education, the importance of building safety considerations into the design \nand management of social networking sites, the imperative for greater attention to \u2018at \nrisk\u2019 children in particular, and the importance of a children\u2019s rights framework in \ndeveloping evidence-based policy in this area. \n \n \n \nCHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 24, 75\u201383 (2010) \nRapid Rise of Social Networking Sites 2 \nSocial networking among UK children and teenagers \n \nEvery few years, governments, the public and even technology providers are taken \naback by the unexpected take up among young people of yet another innovation - \nemail, chatrooms, texting, instant messaging, blogging and, recently, social \nnetworking sites. Public policy aspirations quickly capitalise on these youthful \nenthusiasms, seeking to revitalise agendas of informal education, health and lifestyle \nadvice, and civic participation. Simultaneously, technological innovations afford the \ncommercial world new possibilities for targeted and embedded marketing, while \npublic policy is also required to address new online risks to children\u2019s wellbeing. This \narticle reviews recent findings regarding children and teenagers\u2019 social networking \npractices in order to identify key recommendations for the future research and public \npolicy. \n \nMost social networking sites are intended for teenagers and adults, though some have \nno lower age limit and some target younger children. In 2007, 42% of UK 8-17 year \nolds had a social network profile, including 27% of 8-12 year olds and 55% of 13-17 \nyear olds.1 Similar figures hold in other countries, and use continues to grow \nworldwide, though it may have peaked in the USA and UK among young people \n(comScore, 2008). Ofcom\u2019s survey (2008) found that most users visit social \nnetworking sites daily or every other day, with parental restrictions on use reported by \n62% of middle class users (74% of under 13\u2019s), but fewer than half of working class \nusers of any age; further, middle class and younger children are also more likely to \nhave set their profile to \u2018private\u2019 (i.e. accessible only to friends or family) - 61% of \nsocial network users overall have restricted access to their profile in the UK and \nsimilar figures apply in the US.2\n \nSocial networking sites, like much else on the internet, represent a moving target for \nresearchers and policy-makers. Having recently reached the mass market, they \ncontinue to evolve as domestic broadband access increases and digital technologies of \nall kinds, including GPS location tracking on mobile platforms, become more \navailable. Several previously \u2018closed\u2019 social networking sites now allow their users to \nincorporate features created by third parties and let users log into third party sites \nCHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 24, 75\u201383 (2010) \nRapid Rise of Social Networking Sites 3 \nusing their profile information, potentially undermining corporate responsibility for \nusers\u2019 privacy protection.  \n \nNew opportunities for self-expression, learning, communication and \nnetworking? \n \nBecause identities are constructed within, not outside, discourse, we need to \nunderstand them as produced in specific historical and institutional sites within \nspecific discursive formations and practices, by specific enunciative strategies \n[and] within the play of specific modalities of power (Hall, 1996: 4). \n \nIdentities are constituted through interaction with others. Increasingly, the sites in \nwhich young people perform and experiment with identify include the online domain. \nAs both technology and its uses evolve, this reconfigures the possibilities for social \nidentity construction in ways that are not yet fully understood. But what remains \nconstant, driving online and mobile communication, is young people\u2019s strong desire \nto connect with peers anywhere, anytime - to stay in touch, express themselves and \nshare experiences. Contrary to popular anxieties about isolated loners who stay at \nhome and chat to strangers online, as distinct from the sociable kids with healthy face-\nto-face social lives, empirical research undermines any sharp line between online and \noffline, or virtual and face-to-face. Rather, youthful practices are best characterised by \nthe flexible intermixing of multiple forms of communication, with online \ncommunication primarily used to sustain local friendships already established offline, \nrather than to make new contacts with distant strangers (Boneva, Quinn, Kraut, \nKiesler, & Shklovski, 2006; Gross, 2004; Mesch & Talmud, 2007), and this applies \nequally to social networking (Ellison, Steinfield, & Lampe, 2007; Valkenburg & \nPeter, 2007a, b). \n \nAt the heart of the explosion in online communication is the desire to construct a \nvalued representation of oneself which affirms and is affirmed by one\u2019s peers. \nObservation of teenagers\u2019 social networking practices reveals the pleasure they find \ncreating an online \u2018project of the self\u2019 (Giddens, 1991). A typical teenager\u2019s MySpace \nprofile had a big welcome in sparkly pink, with music, photos, a love tester, \nCHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 24, 75\u201383 (2010) \nRapid Rise of Social Networking Sites 4 \nguestbook and dedication pages, all customised down to the scroll bars and cursor \nwith pink candy stripes, glitter, angels, flowers, butterflies, hearts and more. As she \nsaid, \u2018you can just change it all the time [and so] you can show different sides of \nyourself\u2019 (Danielle, 13, quoted in Livingstone, 2008a). Friends\u2019 responses are often \nstrongly affirming, offering mutual recognition in the peer network (Valkenburg, \nPeter, & Schouten, 2006). \n \nTeenagers have long decorated their bedroom walls with images expressive of their \nidentity, also keeping a diary or photo album, sending notes and chatting to friends. \nSo does online social networking make a difference? Few claim that social \nnetworking to have dramatically transformed children and young people\u2019s lives, but \nits specific affordances do appear to facilitate changes in the quantity and, arguably, \nthe quality of communication: these include the ease, speed and convenience of \nwidespread access and distribution of content, connectivity throughout a near-global \nnetwork, the persistence and searchability of content over time, the facility to \nreplicate, remix and manipulate content, and settings for managing conditions of \nprivacy, anonymity and exchange (boyd & Ellison, 2007; Ito et al., 2008). \n \nOne consequence is the wide circles of friends (or \u2018friends of friends\u2019) sustained by \nsocial networking teenagers: a survey of US 13-18 year olds found the average \nnumber of social networking contacts is 75 (Harris Interactive, 2006). Self-report \nmethods may distort the picture \u2013 an analysis of contacts on a random selection of \npublic MySpace profiles for users aged 16+ found the median number to be only 27 \n(Thelwall, 2008), though contacts numbering in the hundreds are commonplace \n(Salaway, Caruso, Nelson, & Ellison 2008), this enabling bridging social capital \u2013 the \ncreation and maintenance of extensive social networks of weak ties (Ellison et al., \n2007). A second consequence important to by teenagers is that social networking \nenables them to overcome the embarrassments of face-to-face communication, \nbecause they afford asynchronous, noncommittal, playful interaction in which the \nmanagement of \u2018face\u2019 and negotiation of flirting, misinterpretation and innuendo is \nmore controllable (Livingstone, 2008a). Third, social networking disembeds \ncommunication from its traditional anchoring in the face-to-face situation of physical \nco-location where conventions of trust, authenticity and reciprocity are well \nCHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 24, 75\u201383 (2010) \nRapid Rise of Social Networking Sites 5 \nunderstood, re-embedding it in more flexible, complex and ambiguous networks in \nwhich, it seems, children share advice and support with peers (Heverly, 2008). \n \nPossibly, those who do not engage in social networking miss out on more than just \ncommunication. The think tank, Demos, challenges the public sector to keep up with \nand enable \u2018the current generation of young people [who] will reinvent the workplace \nand society\u2019 (Green & Hannon, 2007: 62). Educators and advocates of new digital \nliteracies are confident that social networking encourages the development of \ntransferable technical and social skills of value in formal and informal learning \n(Crook & Harrison, 2008; Ito et al, 2008). Many public sector and non-governmental \norganisations, from educators to child welfare workers to activist movements hope \nthat through social networking services they can address young people on their own \nterms, putting the potential of viral marketing to positive use.3 However, whether \nthese wider benefits exist is yet to be established by empirical research. \n \nNew risks of privacy invasion, bullying and dangerous contacts? \n \nNew opportunities tend to be associated with new risks (Livingstone and Helsper, in \npress). The UK\u2019s Home Office (2008) identifies a series of risks to children\u2019s safety \nassociated with social networking - bullying, harassment, exposure to harmful \ncontent, theft of personal information, sexual grooming, violent behaviour, \nencouragement to self-harm and racist attacks. Anxious headlines \u2013 \u2018Knife a Pal on \nFacebook\u2019 (Clench, 2008), \u2018Facebook spells end of lasting friendships, says expert\u2019 \n(Smith, 2008), \u2018MySpace Invaders: Evil Lurks on Teen Sites\u2019 (Webster & Edwards, \n2007) - certainly overstate the problem, but there are grounds for genuine concern. \nSuch research findings as exist link social networking with a range of content, contact \nand conduct risks to children and young people, including some perpetrated by \nchildren themselves. \n \nThe UK Children Go Online survey of 9-19 year olds found that, among those who \nused the internet at least weekly, 57% had seen online pornography, 31% had seen \nviolent and 11% had seen racist content. Further, 31% had received sexual comments \nonline and 28% had been sent unsolicited sexual material. A third had received \nCHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 24, 75\u201383 (2010) \nRapid Rise of Social Networking Sites 6 \nbullying comments online and 8% had gone to a meeting with someone first met \nonline (Livingstone & Bober, 2005). Two adolescent practices are likely to exacerbate \nonline risk \u2013 the disclosure of personal information and the experimental nature of \npeer communication. Yet it seems teenagers are fairly though not entirely careful \nwhen communicating online. A content analysis of a random sample of 2423 public \nMySpace profiles produced by under 18s found that many provided personal photos \n(57%), but only a few discussed alcohol consumption (18%), showed images of \nfriends in swimsuit\/underwear (16%), provided real names (9%), discussed smoking \n(8%), showed themselves in swimsuit\/underwear (5%) or discussed marijuana use \n(2%) (Hinduja & Patchin, 2008). A USA survey found that while boys and younger \nteens are more likely to post false information, older teenagers (especially girls) are \nmore likely to reveal detailed personal information: overall, 49% included their school \nand 29% their email address (Lenhart & Madden, 2007). An Irish survey of 10-20 \nyear olds found that while 49% gave out their date of birth, only 12% gave their \nmobile phone number and 8% their home address (Anchor, 2007). Since social \nnetworking sites are designed for teenagers to provide at least their name, birth date \nand photograph, such personal disclosures are unsurprising. \n \nThere is growing evidence that personal disclosure facilitates communication risks. \nWhile mild peer-to-peer problems may include teenagers teasing each other by \nposting \u2018embarrassing\u2019 pictures, concerns are growing about \u2018cyberbullying\u2019 (Patchin \n& Hinduja, 2006): a 2006 survey found that, although 69% pupils were bullied in past \nyear, only 7% said they had received unpleasant or bullying emails\/IM\/text messages \n(Bullying UK, 2006), although another survey found 20% had been cyberbullied \n(NCH\/Tesco, 2006). Higher levels of cyberbullying are reported in the USA: 72% of \n12-17 year olds, an online survey found, had been bullied online in the previous year, \nand 85% had also been bullied in school. Although from a self-selected sample, these \nfigures show how online and offline bullying are linked (Juvonen & Gross, 2008): \nHinduja and Patchin (2009) found that 82% of those bullied online knew their \nperpetrator and 42% who reported being cyberbullied were also bullied at school. \n \nMuch research tends not to distinguish modes of communication - email, text, \nchatroom, instant messaging or social networking. While 33% of 10-15 year olds \ncontacted in the USA reported being harassed online in 2007, they were more likely \nCHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 24, 75\u201383 (2010) \nRapid Rise of Social Networking Sites 7 \nto be harassed through instant messaging or chatrooms than via social networking \nsites (Ybarra & Mitchell, 2008). Ybarra et al (2007) argue that teenagers who \ncommunicate in multiple ways online are most at risk of online victimization, as are \nthose who seek out opportunities to talk about sex with unknown people and who \nhave unknown people in their buddy lists (see also Internet Safety Technical Task \nForce, 2009). Having found that lower self-esteem and well-being is more common \namong teenagers who particularly seek opportunities to talk to strangers online, \nValkenburg and Peter (2007a) argue that chatrooms favour such interaction with \nstrangers more than instant messaging. For social networking, a key factor might be \nwhether a teenager\u2019s profile is set to public or private and whether he or she is careful \nor casual in accepting unknown contacts as friends. However, research has yet \ncarefully to disentangle the workings of these different factors \u2013 forms of online \ncommunication, conditions of use, characteristics of the young users, and possible \nadverse consequences. \n \nPolicy implications: balancing opportunities and risks in social \nnetworking \n \nChildren and youth worldwide have adopted social networking sites enthusiastically, \npartly because of the erosion of children\u2019s freedoms in the physical world (Gill, \n2008). But children\u2019s agency should not be overstated, for their practices are \nconstrained by their degree of digital literacy (which is not as high as popularly \nassumed; Livingstone, 2008b), and by the technical designs of social networking sites \n(which impede easy management of settings and transparency regarding the \ncommercial use of personal information). In this section, we identify pressing five \nissues for researchers and policy makers. \n \nFirst, opportunities and risks are linked. Teenagers\u2019 experience of a range of \nopportunities is positively correlated with their experiences of online risk, so that the \nmore opportunities they take up, the more risks they encounter, and the more policy \nattempts to limit risks the more it may also limit opportunities (Livingstone & \nHelsper, in press). Further, the more skilled teenagers are in their use of the internet, \nthe more they experience both opportunities and risks (and not, as often supposed, the \nCHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 24, 75\u201383 (2010) \nRapid Rise of Social Networking Sites 8 \nmore able they are to avoid risks). The interdependencies between risks and \nopportunities are partly due to youthful exploration and risk-taking practices \u2013 it being \npart of adolescence to push boundaries and seek out new, even transgressive \nopportunities (Hope, 2007). It is also a matter of interface design \u2013 for example, \npornography and sexual advice results from the same online search while filters may \nblock both; similarly, poorly designed privacy controls can be misunderstood by users \nseeking to share intimate information with friends. \n \nSecond, as communicative environments develop, so do the media or digital literacy \ndemands on their users. As long as definitions of media literacy remain contested and \nschools remain reluctant to incorporate media education into teacher training and \nclassroom curricula, children\u2019s knowledge will lag behind the industry\u2019s fast-\nchanging practices of embedded marketing, use of personal data, user tracking and so \nforth, most of which is opaque to young people as they navigate the options before \nthem. Further, limitations on and inequalities in digital literacies mean  not all young \npeople benefit from the new opportunities on offer; indeed, providing online resources \nmay exacerbate rather than overcome inequality as opportunities are \ndisproportionately taken up by the already-privileged (Hargittai, 2007).  \n \nThird, addressing risk cannot be left solely to parents and children, as neither fully \nunderstands how to manage this online nor has sufficient resources to do so. Noting \nconfusion among parents, children and those working in child protection regarding the \nrisks social networking poses to children, the UK\u2019s Child Exploitation and Online \nProtection Centre (2006) calls for \u2018safety by design\u2019 so as to build safety protection \ninto the interface rather than relying on the safety awareness and digital literacy skills \nof children and parents. In the UK, the Byron Review (2008) led to a new UK Council \nfor Child Internet Safety, established to provide independent and accountable \noversight of commercial self-regulatory practices. At a European level, the EC Safer \nInternet plus programme has supported guidance for pan-European self-regulation of \nsocial networking services (EC Social Networking Task Force, 2009). One key issue \nis ensuring appropriate privacy protection for children,4 leading the European \nNetwork and Information Agency to consider a range of means to address privacy-\nrelated threats, identity issues and social risks, from awareness raising to improving \ntransparency of data handling practices, and from authentication and consent \nCHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 24, 75\u201383 (2010) \nRapid Rise of Social Networking Sites 9 \nprocesses to default software setting and automated filters; Hogben, 2007; see also \nKesan & Shah, 2006). \n \nFourth, specific attention is required for \u2018at risk\u2019 children, given growing indications \nthat those low in self-esteem or lacking satisfying friendships or relations with parents \nare also those at risk through online social networking communication (Livingstone & \nHelsper, 2007; Valkenburg & Peter, 2007a; Ybarra & Mitchell, 2004) and, further, \nthat those at risk may also be those who then perpetrate harm towards others. A \nbalanced risk assessment should also note that, though dangerous, risks to children \nfrom adult sexual predators on social networking sites are very rare (Internet Safety \nTechnical Task Force, 2009), and more common is the misuse of personal information \nby spammers and fraudsters (Jagatic, Johnson, Jakobsson, & Menczer, 2007) and the \ninadvertent release of personal information harmful to young people's reputations and \nemployment prospects (YouGov, 2007). \n \nLastly, in framing policies to reduce risk, children\u2019s rights must not be forgotten. The \nUN Convention on the Rights of the Child includes the right to freedom of assembly \nand expression as well as freedom from harm and privacy from the state, commerce \nand individuals. Since children are concerned to maintain privacy from their parents, \nthis challenges simplistic advice that parents should \u2018check up\u2019 on their children\u2019s \nsocial networking activities, with or without their permission. The balance between \nopportunities and risks should, arguably, be struck differently for \u2018at risk\u2019 children, \nwhere greater monitoring or restrictions may be legitimate - moreover, for these \nchildren especially, relying on parents to undertake this role may be inappropriate. \n \nIn all, the evidence to date suggests that, for most children, social networking affords \nconsiderable benefits in terms of communication and relationships, less proven \nbenefits as yet regarding learning and participation, and some transfer of bullying and \nother social risks from offline to online domains. While there is, therefore, much left \nto do for policy makers if children are, overall, to gain substantial benefit from social \nnetworking, there is also much left for researchers to do. In writing this article, we \nhave struggled to find sufficient empirical research on which to ground our claims. \nResearch must keep up to date with children and young people\u2019s social practices \nCHILDREN & SOCIETY Vol. 24, 75\u201383 (2010) \nRapid Rise of Social Networking Sites 10 \nonline, as their enthusiasm for social networking is undeniable and their future uses of \nthis technology may, as so often before, still surprise us. \n \nReferences \n \nAcquisti, A., & Gross, E.
