It would be difficult to argue with the\neditors\u2019 conclusion that \u2018 it is not only possible to achieve security in a democratic\nsociety but that security, the rule of law, and democracy are actually complementary\nand self-reinforcing objectives \u2019 (pp. 321\u20132). Rather less self-evident is their faith in\ncitizen participation as a solution to problems of abusive policing and as a means to\nenhance security. As Fuentes\u2019 analysis of the struggle for police accountability in\nArgentina and Chile shows, civil society includes well-organised pressure groups that\nlobby for more, not less police repression; the thoughtful analyses by Smulovitz and\nFo\u00a8hrig et al. also point to questionable aspects of citizen involvement. Their case\nstudies serve as a useful reminder that the concept of community policing in its\nvarious guises has been subjected to a barrage of criticism because of its potentially\nnon-benign impact on policing within the rule of law. In societies characterised by\nextreme inequality, the effects of unequal citizen involvement may actually exacer-\nbate the inequitable provision of public security. One would have wished the editors\nto address this point in their concluding remarks. Nevertheless, Toward a Society under\nLaw remains an impressive collection of essays. As one of the contributors (Ward)\npoints out, the growing body of police research and evaluation in Latin America is\nstill small (p. 173) ; the volume under review represents an important addition to this\nresearch and will be an indispensable tool for scholars and practitioners.\nR U T H S T A N L E YFree University of Berlin, Institute of Political Science\nJ.

Pereira, Political (In)Justice : Authoritarianism and the Rule of Law in\nBrazil, Chile and Argentina (Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press,\n2005), pp. xvi+262, $27.95, pb.\nIntuitively, most of us would say that legality and dictatorship do not sit well\ntogether. Yet, Anthony Pereira successfully juxtaposes these two concepts by\nexamining military regimes\u2019 use of political trials in Brazil (1964\u201385), Chile (1973\u201390)\nand Argentina (1976\u201383). Why explore the use of law by authoritarian regimes?\nPereira notes that most authoritarian regimes avoid attempts at ruling by force\nalone ; instead, they strive to attain or maintain legitimacy by making some pretence\nof legality \u2013 that is, by \u2018 judicializing \u2019 their repression. Some regimes, of course,\nprove more successful at this task than others through constitutional and legislative\ntinkering, judicial manipulation, and tolerating legislative bodies and trials. Those\nregimes that do find appropriate institutional channels for dealing with their op-\nposition are likely to enjoy greater longevity and cohesion.\nPereira selects Brazil, Chile and Argentina as his three cases because their three\nmilitary regimes were founded on similar concerns about left-wing populist move-\nments and faced common external constraints and influences. He specifically\nexamines political trials, as such trials are an important means by which many\nauthoritarian regimes try to legitimate their rule. These trials highlight the salient\npolitical discourse of the day and the extent to which lawyers enjoy the freedom to\nmount a defence using legal guarantees. Examination of this legal space (or lack\nthereof), Pereira argues, offers important insights into a regime\u2019s style of governance,\nform and intensity of repression, legitimacy, and even processes of post-transition\nlegal reform. Political trials and legal manipulations can diffuse popular opposition\nmovements, generating legitimacy and approval for the regime and providing an\nReviews 883\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 27 Apr 2009 IP address: 158.143.197.55\nillusion of fair play at the same time as they creating negative images of the op-\nposition. Not least, they hold out the potential of stabilising repression by generating\nreasonably predictable rules on which opponents and governing officials can centre\ntheir expectations.\nPereira\u2019s main finding is a stark contrast in the extent to which Brazil and\nArgentina relied upon political trials to deal with the opposition. At one end of the\nspectrum is Argentina, with almost complete disregard for legal conventions : the\nProceso regime opted for heavy reliance on extrajudicial execution of suspected\nsubversives and engaged in a \u2018 total and merciless war on the alleged agents of\nsubversion \u2019 (p. 52). Political trials were rarely conducted ; large numbers of judges\nand lawyers were tortured in Argentina, and random acts of brutality were com-\nmonplace. Indeed, Pereira concludes that the military regime \u2018 largely dispensed with\nany kind of legal strategy \u2019 (p. 52).\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum is Brazil, which tried to maintain the ap-\npearance of legality through gradualism and continuity. The traditional mechanisms,\nincluding the functioning of a controlled Congress throughout most of the twenty-\none-year dictatorship and the maintenance of controlled two-party elections, have\nfeatured prominently in academic scholarship. What Pereira brings into the mix is\nconsideration of the important, yet understudied, role of political trials. Indeed,\nBrazil made routine use of military courts to prosecute dissenters and opponents.\nThese trials were not all for show, as one might expect to find under an authoritarian\nregime. Rather, Pereira argues that there were comparatively high acquittal rates,\nlight sentences, space for lawyers to secure guarantees for political prisoners and\nreduction of sentences on appeal, and a greater reliance in practice on existing\ncriminal law than on new national security legislation (p. 89). Overall, Brazil\u2019s pol-\nitical trials \u2018preserved more elements of traditional legal procedures and doctrines \u2019\nthan those in Argentina and Chile and gave defence lawyers maneuvering room to\npush for greater liberalisation of the regime (p. 140).\nChile\u2019s approach fell in between those of Argentina and Brazil. Instead of cir-\ncumventing the legal process, the regime permitted many trials. Yet here individuals\nwere sentenced to longer penalties (20 per cent of Chilean defendants in Pereira\u2019s\nsample received sentences of ten years or more, in contrast to 12.4 per cent in Brazil)\nand to harsher sentences of life imprisonment and death \u2013 sentences that were not\napplied in Brazil.\nThe ratio of those prosecuted in courts to those killed by the state offers a telling\nreflection of the legal strategy of the three regimes. In Brazil this ratio was twenty-\nthree to one. In Chile for every 1.5 persons put on trial, one was killed, whereas in\nArgentina, seventy-one people were killed extrajudicially for every one individual put\non trial (p. 23). To explain this variation among the three cases, Pereira rejects\ncultural explanations and those perspectives that emphasise the strength of the\nopposition to military rule. To understand the differing organisational adaptations\nto dealing with the opposition, he proposes a historically grounded institutionalist\nexplanation. The key variable, he argues, is the \u2018degree of military and judicial con-\nsensus, integration, and cooperation\u2019 (p. 191). In order to gauge consensus and\nintegration between the military and judiciary, he examines the organisation of the\nmilitary justice system, the formal structure of courts, and the degree of harmony\nbetween military and civilian views expressed in the press, legal decisions, specialised\njournals and memoirs dealing with national security, political trials, and treatment of\nregime opponents.\n884 Reviews\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 27 Apr 2009 IP address: 158.143.197.55\nThose familiar with the Southern Cone dictatorships will not be surprised by\nPereira\u2019s classification of Brazil as most liberal in its use of law, with Argentina on\nthe other extreme and Chile in the middle, given that the military regimes of these\nthree countries have generally been ranked in this way along a scale of repression\nin the academic literature. There are also numerous parallels with the political space\nafforded to Catholic Church opposition to military rule in the three countries, a\ncomparison not drawn in the book.\nOverall, Pereira\u2019s book offers a new and insightful lens through which to explore\nregime consolidation through the judiciary, going beyond the traditional focus\non societal threat, military cohesion or economic stewardship. Political (In)Justice will\nbe a welcome and informative resource for students and scholars of dictatorship and\ndemocratisation in Latin America and beyond. Pereira\u2019s focus on enclaves of legality\nwithin authoritarian regimes provokes thought regarding the insidious effects of\nthe reverse situation : the corrosive potential of authoritarian practices within\ndemocratic regimes, particularly the new \u2018special \u2019 legal regimes and clandestine\npractices designed by the United States to deal with citizen and foreign terrorist\nsuspects. The South American military regimes\u2019 attempts to justify their actions in\nthe name of national security cloaked in the trappings of legality, he argues, should\nserve as a \u2018sobering warning to citizens of democracy that their rights too, may be\ndismantled one law, one executive order, one administrative procedure at time \u2019\n(p. 200). Pereira\u2019s volume provides a timely warning, reminding scholars and\nstudents of the many lessons to be learned from comparative historical research.\nM E R C E D E S S.

The first is why is there so much violence\nin Brazil\u2019s \u2018marvellous city \u2019, Rio de Janeiro? Second, what can be done to curb this\nviolence? Arias offers answers through ethnographic studies of three of Rio\u2019s slums\n(favelas) : Tubara\u02dco, Viga\u00b4rio Geral and Santa Ana, proposing what he calls a network\nperspective on the problem. Arias suggests that the common perception, that the\nabsence of the state in favelas allows for violence, is misleading. It is not the absence\nof the state that leads to violence, he contends, but rather the construction of a\nparticular kind of state order in these localities. Furthermore, portraying favelas as\npart of stable, traditional patron-client relationships is also largely incorrect. Instead,\nloose, shifting networks link drug traffickers, the police, politicians, and the leaders\nof community associations (associac\u00b8o\u02dces dos moradores, or AMs) and NGOs. Upsurges\nand declines in violence are due at least in part to transformations in these networks.\nFurthermore, the location of favelas has a major influence on the character of their\nnetworks. Arias thus accounts for variation and change in patterns of violence in a\npersuasive manner.\nThe main actors involved in favela violence are drug traffickers, who need the\ncooperation of other favela residents and protection from the police and politicians ;\nAM leaders, who seek external resources and some kind of modus vivendi with traf-\nfickers ; politicians, who want to enter favelas to garner votes ; and NGO leaders who\nwant to promote successful programmes and move on to better positions within the\nReviews 885\n"}
