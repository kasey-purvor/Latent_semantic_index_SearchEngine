INTRODUCTION \n \nUnderstanding the dynamic response of polymer materials is becoming \nincreasingly important due to their use in explosive compositions, warhead design and \ncomposite material construction.  For the latter example, glass fibre reinforced composite \nlaminates have been used for many years in armour systems that are inherently subjected \nto shock [1]. The shock response of carbon fibre \/ epoxy composites is also of interest \ndue to these materials becoming more commonly used in military and civilian aircraft.  \nConsequently the response of these materials due to high velocity impact of small \nprojectiles has been studied. [2-5] \nAn important constituent part to a carbon fibre reinforced plastic is the polymeric \nmatrix. Carter and Marsh [6] conducted an extensive study on the shock response of \npolymer materials, and showed that a significant number of polymers, and indeed an \nepoxy resin, undergo a change in slope in the shock velocity \u2013 particle velocity curve at \nhigh stresses (~20-30GPa). The authors thought that this was probably best explained in \nterms of pressure-induced cross-linking of the long polymer chains.  In particular, for the \npolymers that contained aromatic rings in their monomer structure and that showed the \nlargest volume change at transformation, it was proposed that tetragonal bonds form \nbetween the chains in a manner analogous to the graphite \/ diamond transformation. \nOther researchers have shown that for polymers that contain a phenyl ring, such as \npolystyrene, this behaviour can be explained in terms of the ring\u2019s collapse at the \nelevated pressures [7]. Other researchers have shown that certain polymers have a \npositive dependence on shear strength with increasing shock stress.  This behaviour has \nPolymer Composites Vol. 29 (10) pp. 1106-1110 \n 4\nbeen seen in polycarbonate [8], PMMA [9], and PTFE [10] with embedded lateral \ngauges.  This behaviour has also been observed in the elastomer Estane\u2122 [10].  \nUnlike metals, thermoplastic polymers and ceramics, there is a paucity of data \ndealing with the shock response of thermoset epoxy resins.  This is perhaps surprising as \nthese resins are integral to the construction of considerable civilian and military hardware \nthat is subjected to shock.  Munson and May [11] investigated three different epoxy resin \nsystems that used different hardening agents. They found that, within experimental error, \nthe measured Hugoniot of the material was the same for each resin.  Barnes et al [12] \nhave measured the Hugoniot of an epoxy resin, and found that it was very similar to that \nof Munson and May.  Both sets of researchers assumed a linear shock velocity particle \nvelocity relationship.  Barnes et al suggested that, similar to the polymers mentioned \nabove, their resin demonstrated a positive dependence of shear strength with shock stress. \nThis positive dependence has been investigated by Bourne et al [13] and in \naccompanying work by Millett et al [14] who used the embedded lateral gauge technique \nto directly measure the variation of lateral stress. They observed that with increasing \nshock stress, the lateral stresses decreased resulting in an increase in strength behind the \nshock. \n \nIn this study, we have investigated the shock behaviour of a commercially important \naromatic amine epoxy resin. This resin is a key constituent of carbon epoxy composite \nmaterials that are used by the aerospace industry. This work is part of a larger programme \nof work examining the impact and shock behaviour of carbon-fibre \/ epoxy composite \nmaterials. \nPolymer Composites Vol. 29 (10) pp. 1106-1110 \n 5\nII. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE \n \nA common way for measuring the shock Hugoniot of materials is by conducting plate-\nimpact experiments. A typical experimental set-up is shown below in Figure 1(a). Here, a \nflyer-plate is accelerated towards the target and arrives so that all points on the \nprojectile\u2019s surface make contact with the target simultaneously. The impact generates a \nplanar shock wave in the target.  In this situation, all strain is accommodated along the \nimpact axis while the orthogonal components of strain are zero due to inertial \nconfinement.  \n \nFigure 1: (a) the Flyer plate technique, (b) schematic target assembly \n \nThe shock response of the resin target was measured using two Vishay Micro-\nmeasurements Manganin Pressure gauges LM-SS-125CH-048, encapsulated between two \nlayers of 25\u03bcm Mylar.  Calibration of the gauges was to Rosenberg et al [15].  Dural (Al \n6082-T6) and copper flyers were accelerated to velocities of between 176 m\/s and 992 \nm\/s using a \u220550-mm single-stage gas gun.  A typical target set-up is given schematically \nin Figure 1(b).  One gauge (the \u2018front-surface gauge\u2019) is fixed at the interface between the \ncover plate and the test specimen, and the other (the \u2018back surface gauge\u2019) is fixed \nbetween the test specimen and the backing material.  The shock Hugoniot was measured \nusing the standard impedance matching technique [16]. Before firing, the thickness of \neach test specimen was carefully measured, so that the distance between the gauges was \naccurately known.  By measuring the time of arrival of the shock at each gauge, the \n(assumed constant) shock velocity (Us) could be calculated from the transit time (\u0394t) of \nPolymer Composites Vol. 29 (10) pp. 1106-1110 \n 6\nthe shock across the specimen.  By knowing the Hugoniot of the flyer plate material and \nthe impact velocity we established a value for the particle velocity (up) behind the shock.  \nHugoniot data for our flyer-plate materials were taken from Marsh [17] and the velocities \nof the projectile were measured by using a sequential pin shorting system to an accuracy \nof 0.5%. Fast digital storage oscilloscopes (2 GS\/s) were used to capture the arrival and \nshape of the shock; subsequent data reduction and analysis was done on a PC.  \n \nIII MATERIALS USED \n \nThe resin studied was a commercially available epoxy\/amine resin system supplied by \nHexcel Composites (Duxford UK) with the trade name RTM6.  This resin was specially \ndeveloped to fulfil the requirements of the aerospace composites industry in advanced \nresin transfer moulding (RTM) processes. It consists of a multifunctional epoxy resin \ncured with a mixture of aromatic amines. \n \nThe resin was fully cured at 180\u00b0C for two hours at atmospheric pressure. The resulting \nblocks of resin measuring 70 mm \u00d7 70 mm square and 10 mm thick were machined to 6 \nmm thickness and lapped to a flatness of \u00b15\u03bcm.  The longitudinal and shear velocities \nwere measured using 5MHz quartz transducers with a Panametrics 5077PR pulser-\nreceiver in the pulse-echo configuration.  Density was measured using a Micrometrics \nAccuPyc 1330 gas pycnometer. The elastic properties of the cured resin are provided in \nTable I. \n \nPolymer Composites Vol. 29 (10) pp. 1106-1110 \n 7\nTable I:  Elastic properties of the cured RTM6 resin. \n \nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nA typical gauge trace for the RTM6 resin is seen below in Figure 2.  In this example, a 5-\nmm thick copper flyer was accelerated to 566 m\/s prior to impact with the resin target.  \n \nFigure 2: Typical gauge trace showing the formation of the shock and release. \n \nIn each stress history, the stress rises rapidly to its maximum value in 40-50 ns.  This is \ndue to the close match between the shock impedance of the epoxy sample, the gauge \nbacking substrate and the epoxy adhesive used to construct the gauge package.  It can be \nseen on the front-surface gauge trace that just before the arrival of the shock there is an \napparent drop in measured stress.  This feature is not present on the back-surface gauge.  \nWe believe that this is due to the motion of the conducting cover plate towards the gauge, \nwhich increases the capacitance between the gauge and the cover plate.  It can also be \nseen that the there is an overshoot recorded by the front-surface gauge as the measured \nstress reaches its maximum value. This is due to the fast rising nature of the shock \ncausing ringing [18].  The Hugoniot stress is measured, in this example, over the period \nfrom 0.8 to 2.2\u03bcs.  The stress level in the back-surface gauge over the period from 2.6 to \n3.6\u03bcs is similar to the Hugoniot stress measured by the front-surface gauge.  This \nindicates that both the resin and the PMMA have very similar shock impedance levels.   \n \nPolymer Composites Vol. 29 (10) pp. 1106-1110 \n 8\nThe Hugoniot of many polymers, metals and ceramics can be fitted assuming a linear \nshock velocity \u2013 particle velocity relationship given by the following equation: \n \nUs = c0 + S.uP        (1) \n \nwhere S  is the slope and c0 is the intercept of the shock velocity axis. This has previously \nbeen observed in other polymers such as PMMA [9], polycarbonate [8], polyether ether \nKetone [19] and an epoxy resin [14]. For metals, c0 has been correlated with the bulk \nsound speed of the material whereas S has been theoretically shown to relate to the first \nderivative of bulk modulus with pressure [20]. Our measured Hugoniot in shock velocity \n\u2013 particle velocity space is shown below in Figure 3: \n \nFigure 3: The measured Hugoniot of the resin in shock velocity particle velocity space. \n \nThere are two points to note here. Firstly, a linear line of regression has been fitted \nthrough all ten data points resulting in c0 and S values of 2.65 mm\/\u03bcs and 1.55 \nrespectively.  However we note that other researchers [7,21] have shown from theoretical \nconsiderations that the Hugoniot for many polymers over a much larger particle velocity \nrange is parabolic instead of linear. Secondly, the fitted line provides a bulk sound speed \nof 2.65 mm\/\u03bcs which is higher than the ultrasonically measured value of 2.26 mm\/\u03bcs at \nthe frequency of the transducer (5MHz). This is consistent with epoxy behaviour, and \nindeed most polymer behaviour as surveyed by Carter and Marsh and points to a rapidly \nvarying rate of change in compressibility in the low particle velocity region [6]. \nPolymer Composites Vol. 29 (10) pp. 1106-1110 \n 9\n \nIn Table II below we have summarised the shock parameters for epoxy resins from a \nnumber of sources.  References 6, 11 and 22 used a commercially available general \npurpose epoxy resin Epon 828.  This resin is a typical epoxy, being a condensation \nproduct of epichlorohydrin and Bisphenol-A.  Millett et al [14] used a blend of epoxy \nprepolymers based on modified and unmodified Bisphenol-A, with the addition of a \ndiglycidyl ether polypropylene glycol plasticizer.  Several amine hardeners were used.  \nMunson and May used three different hardening systems:  metaphenylenediamine \n(MPDA); an aromatic eutectic mixture of methylenedianiline, MPDA and phenylglycidyl \nether; and the organic salt of tridimethyl aminomethyl phenol.  Boettger [22] used a \nrelatively high percentage weight (30%) commercially available hardener \u2013 Jeffamine\u00ae \nT-403, a poyether triamine. Millet et al used a cycloaliphatic polyamine. \n \nIt can be seen that, despite the data being acquired by a variety of researchers over \nseveral decades for ostensibly different epoxy resin systems, the Hugoniots in shock \nvelocity \u2013 particle velocity space are quite similar.  Our data are in good agreement with \nthose of the other researchers.  This work supports the view of Munson and May, that the \nshock response of cured epoxy resins does not depend strongly on the degree of \ncrosslinking, nor on the structural properties of the crosslinking chains. \n \nTable II: Shock parameters for epoxy resin systems; the ultrasonic measurement of cB is also added. \n \nWe have also measured the release time for each of our experiments.  This was done in a \nsystematic way by numerically differentiating the stress history, and selecting the time at \nPolymer Composites Vol. 29 (10) pp. 1106-1110 \n 10\nwhich the differential became negative.  For certain experiments, there is a degree of \noscillation near to the release portion of each differentiated stress history, and it is \ntherefore difficult to obtain the precise timing of the onset of release.  This uncertainty is \nreflected in the choice of error bars on subsequent analyses. \n \nThe distance between the two stress gauges is compressed by the passage of the shock \nwave according to \n \nx = x0 1\u2212 upc0 + Sup\n\u239b \n\u239d \u239c \n\u239e \n\u23a0 \u239f ,       (2) \n \nwhere x0 and x are the thicknesses of material before the arrival of the shock front and \nbehind it respectively. From the compressed distance between gauges, we established the \nrelease velocity by measuring the time between releases from the shock traces. \nConsequently the release wave velocity (UR) can be calculated (UR = x\/\u0394tR). This data is \nplotted in Figure 4. \n \nFigure 4: A plot of the calculated release wave velocities. One data point is omitted due to premature \nfailure of one of the gauges in that experiment. \n \nIt is interesting to note that the measured intercept (2.68 mm\/\u00b5s) is very similar to the \nintercept calculated from the resin\u2019s Hugoniot (2.65 mm\/\u00b5s). This behaviour has also \nbeen seen by Millett et al in polycarbonate and implies that the material returns to its \nambient condition without factors such as phase transformations occurring [8]. Isbell [23] \nPolymer Composites Vol. 29 (10) pp. 1106-1110 \n 11\nestimates the head of the release wave to travel in metals at a velocity of 1.2Us + up and \nfor the RTM6 resin, this equates to a release velocity given by UR = 3.18 + 2.87up. Given \nthat Isbell\u2019s data are for a range of metals of varying c0 values, including Dural, OFHC \ncopper, Iron and Titanium it is perhaps surprising that the relationships are similar in \ngradient at least. \n \nFinally, in Figure 5 below we plot the Hugoniot in longitudinal stress \u2013 particle velocity \nspace.  The gauges used in this study, and their mounting within the target, measure the \nlongitudinal stress (\u03c3x) that consists of a hydrostatic component and a deviatoric \ncomponent of stress in accordance with \n \n\u03c3x = P + 43\u03c4 ,        (3) \nwhere P is the hydrodynamic pressure and \u03c4  is the shear stress. \n \nAlso fitted to the data is a calculation of the hydrodynamic pressure calculated by \n \npsuUP 0\u03c1=          (4) \n \nwhere Us is calculated from Equation 1 using our experimentally determined shock \nparameters. Note that there is a good fit for the data at the lower particle velocities \nindicating that the material is behaving hydrodynamically.  However beyond a shock \nstress of c. 4 GPa the measured stress is greater than the value predicted by the \nhydrodynamic curve.  Similar behaviour has been observed in a range of materials from \nPolymer Composites Vol. 29 (10) pp. 1106-1110 \n 12\npolymers, [8,9] epoxy resins [14] and ceramics [24], and is evidence that this particular \nresin possesses an ability to strengthen with increasing shock stress. A possible \nhypothesis to explain this is that steric resistance to compression increases, as initially \nseparate polymer chains are brought closer together and begin to interact. Other work on \na range of polymers [25] has shown that the stress level at which departure from the \nhydrodynamic curve occurs can be modified by the choice of the side group attached to \nthe main polymer chain. This work concluded that increasing the size of the side groups \nincreased the resistance to compression, with polystyrene (having a phenyl side group) \nshowing a departure from the hydrodynamic curve of c.1 GPa at 0.9 mm\/\u00b5s. We believe \nthat our results are consistent with this view. For the RTM6 resin, this occurs at c. 0.85 \nmm\/\u00b5s. \n \nThe shock parameters from our experiments are shown in Table III.  \n \nFigure 5: Stress \u2013 particle velocity Hugoniot plots for the resin. \n \nTable III: Experimental data. \n \nV. CONCLUSIONS \n \nWe have measured the shock and release behaviour of a commercially important epoxy \nresin that is used in the manufacture of a carbon epoxy composites. The Hugoniot in \nshock velocity \u2013 particle velocity space is given by Us = 2.65 + 1.55 up (\u03c10 = 1.141 g\/cc); \nthe measured release wave velocity is given by UR = 2.68 +3.05 up.  The Hugoniot is \nPolymer Composites Vol. 29 (10) pp. 1106-1110 \n 13\nsimilar in shock velocity-particle velocity space to published data for numerous resins of \ndiffering composition that has been collated over several decades. At higher shock \nstresses, the behaviour of the resin exhibits an increase in shear stress behind the shock \nwave in common with many other polymers. The specific reason for this is unclear but \nfor other polymers this behaviour has been suggested as being due to side groups \nrestricting compression between chains.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \n The authors would like to thank Mr Steven Mortimer of Hexcel, Duxford, UK for \nsupplying the cured resin samples.
