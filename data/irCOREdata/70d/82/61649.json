The Biozone 2141A is characterized by common taeniate and non-taeniate bisaccate pollen and Cycadopites cymbatus, particularly toward the top.

This seven-fold subdivision is a significant improvement on previous palynozonations of the Al Khlata Formation, which only allowed three- or four-fold subdivisions. However, there still remain considerable uncertainties in dating the lowermost biozones, 2159A and 2159B. Improvements in the dating of the Al Khlata Formation are most likely to come from palynological correlations with radiometrically- or faunally-dated successions in South America, eastern Australia, and southern Africa. \\u","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/61649.pdf","fullTextIdentifier":"http:\/\/nora.nerc.ac.uk\/6039\/1\/penney_et_al.pdf","pdfHashValue":"9c2d82d9ec8166770c98067545fbc90c63033b2c","publisher":"American Association of Stratigraphic Palynologists","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n    \n    \n      oai:nora.nerc.ac.uk:6039<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2012-11-22T11:56:41Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n      7374617475733D707562<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      7375626A656374733D533130<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      74797065733D61727469636C65<\/setSpec><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:relation>\n    \n      \n        http:\/\/nora.nerc.ac.uk\/id\/eprint\/6039\/<\/dc:relation><dc:title>\n        A high resolution palynozonation for the Al Khlata Formation (Pennsylvanian to Lower Permian), South Oman<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        Penney, Randall A.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Al Barram, Issam<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\n        Stephenson, Michael<\/dc:creator><dc:subject>\n        Earth Sciences<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\n        Palynology is the main method of correlating the subsurface glaciogenic Al Khlata Formation (Pennsylvanian to Lower Permian) of Oman due to the extreme lateral variability of facies and poor seismic resolution.
