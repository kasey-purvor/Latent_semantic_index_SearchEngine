Consider-\nation is given to this assertion by drawing upon the experiences of staff and evidence from students\nat the University of Southampton in the use of a video, Back Care for Health Professionals, before and\nafter it was streamed. The resulting case study highlights various issues and concerns, both logistical\nand pedagogic. These include ease of access, the form and frequency of guidance with respect to\ntechnical matters, the use of multiple channels of communication to convey key messages about the\navailability and value of the video, and the provision of demonstrations or \u2018tasters\u2019. In other words,\nwhat some might regard as the \u2018softer\u2019 aspects of technological developments should receive at least\nas much attention as the \u2018harder\u2019.\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, one of the most significant advances in the provision of moving\nimages as an educational resource has been the advent of video streaming. The Joint\nInformation Systems Committee (JISC) has defined video streaming as: \nTransmission of moving images over the internet in compressed form as a continuous\nstream. A recipient equipped with suitable \u2018player\u2019 software can decompress and view the\nimages in real time\u2014as distinct from the alternative of waiting while a video file is down-\nloaded and viewing subsequently. (JISC, 2004)\nRecognition of the potential of streaming in educational settings led to JISC funding\ntwo major projects in this field: Click and Go Video (2002) and LIFESIGN (2002).\n*Corresponding author. Centre for Learning and Teaching, University of Southampton, Highfield,\nSouthampton SO17 1BJ, UK. Email: rmo2@soton.ac.uk\n140 M. Bracher et al.\nBoth projects reached similar conclusions regarding the benefits of streaming. The\nClick and Go project team expressed them in the following terms: \nThe advantage of streaming is that it can enable easier and more responsive on-demand\naccess to multimedia resources. Perhaps even more exciting is the possibility of integrating\nvideo and audio with other web-based resources, for example communication and quiz\ntools. (Thornhill et al., 2002, p. 5)\nLikewise, members of the LIFESIGN project team argued that one of the reasons for\ninvesting time and money in streaming existing educational videos is to enhance their\nflexibility and value as a learning resource. They also claimed that streamed video can\nbe accessed more readily and be more effectively \u2018embedded \u2026 in the student learn-\ning environment\u2019 (Shephard et al., 2003, p. 16) than conventional video. Another\nmore recent development in this field is the Digital Video Applications research\nproject, which is based in the Open University Library. One of its aims is to explore\nthe use of video streams in the context of resource-based learning and their pedagog-\nical impact (Digital Video Applications, 2004). Meanwhile, Shephard (2003) has\nestablished a case for more formal evaluation and communication of educational\nprocesses involving streaming, and identified elements of a research agenda that\ncould further develop the application of streaming technology in education.\nIn this paper, the authors report on their experiences of using an educational video,\nBack Care for Health Professionals, before and after it was streamed, with particular\nattention being paid to the latter. Back Care for Health Professionals was produced by\nthe University of Southampton, in conjunction with the National Back Pain Associ-\nation, in 1998 and comprises two videos. The first highlights the need to give contin-\nuous attention to back care (i.e. on a 24-hour basis) and the second demonstrates safe\nmoving and handling practices in a hospital environment. Each video is divided into\na number of parts. To supplement the conventional video, a written guide explains\nits purpose, suggests a possible format for running a course with the material and\ncontains text suitable for photocopying onto overhead transparencies. The guide was\nadapted by the University of Southampton from one published jointly by the National\nBack Pain Association and Royal College of Nursing in 1998. The video was used in\nthe conventional format until the summer of 2002.\nThe re-purposing of the video for streaming purposes was carried out under the\nauspices of the LIFESIGN project during the late spring of 2002, with the video\nstream being available from the end of June 2002 (Shephard et al., 2003). The stream\nis incorporated into a Web-based learning resource, which provides supporting text\nlinked to each section of the video. The purpose of the text is to assist learners in\nengaging with the content of the video stream. Since becoming available there have\nbeen a number of opportunities for investigating different aspects of its use. The case\nstudy presented in this paper serves as a contribution to the ongoing debate concern-\ning access to and engagement with video streams, particularly in the context of\nblended learning. The paper is divided into four parts. The first discusses the experi-\nence of using the back care video as a learning resource prior to its streaming. In\nthe second part, an assessment is made of two attempts to facilitate engagement with\nVideo streams for educational purposes 141\nthe streamed video by participants on a moving and handling post-registration\nfoundation course in 2002. The third part focuses on usage of the video stream by\nfirst-year allied health profession undergraduates in 2002\/03 and 2003\/04. In the\nfinal part, issues and concerns are highlighted. Ethical approval for collecting student\nevaluation data regarding the video streaming was secured from the internal ethics\ncommittee of the relevant school of the university. Approval, however, did not extend\nto collecting student evaluations of the conventional use of the video, and conse-\nquently in this part of the paper reliance is placed primarily on the impressions of the\ntutors concerned. Although this has resulted in a narrowing of the empirical base, it\ndoes highlight the need to work within, and to respect, the ethical conventions of\ndifferent disciplines, in this case those relating to health care, when undertaking\neducational research.\nThroughout the paper, the authors combine critical reflection (Clarke & Croft,\n1998) on, and informed judgement of, the efficacy of video streaming in general, and\nBack Care for Health Professionals in particular, with evidence from various sources,\nincluding students. The overall conclusion is that if the potential of video streaming\nas a learning resource is to be maximised, then attention has to be given to issues of:\n(i) access, and (ii) accessing and engagement (Shephard et al., 2003; Fill & Ottewill,\n2005).\nEvaluation of conventional use of the video\nFrom the point of view of tutors, prior to its streaming Back Care for Health Profes-\nsionals was seen as making an important contribution to the learning of both\nundergraduates and postgraduates. This was because back care and moving and\nhandling skills have long been key components of the first-year curriculum for\nallied health professions and for specialist post-registration courses. Thus, tutors\nconsidered the video to be an essential learning resource rather than an optional\nextra. The importance of the video was stressed to students, by showing them part\nof the video in class and encouraging them to borrow a copy from a member of\nstaff, which they could then view in their own time. Judging by the number of\nrequests for the video, many did so either on their own or in small groups. By this\nmeans, they were able to reinforce their learning and prepare for a practical exami-\nnation, in which they were required to demonstrate two handling manoeuvres,\npaying particular attention to client safety and also to posture and personal well-\nbeing. Since they had no advance warning of which manoeuvres they had to\ndemonstrate, they needed to be competent in them all and the video served to\nremind them of what was involved.\nOn the whole, tutors felt that the arrangements for providing students with access\nto the video worked reasonably well. Indeed, students appeared to gain enjoyment\nand satisfaction from using it as a means of preparing for their examination. Tutors,\nhowever, were by no means complacent. From student surveys (the detailed results\nof which have to remain confidential for ethical reasons) and personal observation\nthey were aware that some students did not follow their advice and made no use of\n142 M. Bracher et al.\nthe video, while a number of those who wanted to view it found it difficult to get hold\nof a copy. They also recognised that a conventional video was in some respects a rela-\ntively blunt and inflexible learning resource, and one that did not necessarily encour-\nage engagement. Indeed, Laurillard (2002) describes video as, primarily, a narrative\nmedium that does not, easily and on its own, support active learning unless delivered\nthrough a computer. \u2018In this mode it inherits expectations of interactivity\u2019 (Lauril-\nlard, 2002, p. 105). By taking advantage of streaming technology tutors hoped to\nreduce these negative attributes. More positively, they hoped to improve access and\nfacilitate \u2018richer and deeper learning\u2019 and greater student-centredness (Thornhill et\nal., 2002, p. 7).\nEvaluation of postgraduate use of streamed video: 2002\nThe first group of students to whom it was hoped to make the video stream available\nwere those enrolled on a post-registration foundation moving and handling course,\nwhich started in July 2002. The basic format of this short course is a one-week\nintensive study and practical programme, for health care professionals, held in\nSouthampton. Following this there is a period for reflecting on what has been learnt,\nundertaking assessment tasks, revising for a practical examination and producing a\nwritten assignment. The latter is undertaken in the students\u2019 own practices and\/or\nlocal higher education\/further education (HE\/FE) institutions. Since students attend\nthe course from all over the country it was hoped that they would be able to access\nthe video in their home area, having been given a taster of the video during their time\nat Southampton.\nIt was not possible, however, for students to access the streams in their own homes,\neven if they had broadband. This was because, in taking account of copyright restric-\ntions, access to LIFESIGN project streams was limited to the internet protocol (IP)\naddresses of computers in HE\/FE institutions. Thus, the best alternative was to\nsecure access for them at a local HE\/FE institution. Of the 24 students on the course,\nabout 10 expressed interest in accessing the video by this means.\nIn the event, this proved to be impossible to arrange for most students. A major\nhurdle was that there was not, at the time, a computing and information technology\nequivalent of the UK Libraries Plus Scheme. This meant that there were no \u2018recipro-\ncal arrangements\u2019 whereby students could use facilities in their home locality by virtue\nof being registered with an HE\/FE institution elsewhere. Consequently, access had to\nbe requested on a \u2018case by case\u2019 basis. Although most requests secured a positive\nresponse, this was clearly a time-consuming process. Moreover, the numbers\ninvolved were very small and the case for access could be justified in terms of assisting\nthe LIFESIGN project. Requests for larger numbers of students that could not be\nlinked to a project of this kind might well have been rejected. Since then, following a\npilot project that ran from 2002 to 2003, a UK Computing Plus Scheme has been\nintroduced. At the time of writing, however, the number of libraries participating in\nthe scheme is very small by comparison with those in the UK Libraries Plus Scheme\n(UK Libraries Plus, 2005).\nVideo streams for educational purposes 143\nDifficulties over access also arose when it was discovered that some HE\/FE insti-\ntutions were not included in LIFESIGN\u2019s IP address inventory. At the same time,\nwhere it was possible to overcome the previous two difficulties, it was sometimes\nfound that the IT equipment did not have sound cards and\/or Windows Media\nPlayer. As a result, the video stream could not be accessed.\nWhile it can be argued that at least some of these difficulties could have been antic-\nipated, it is often the case that, without the benefit of hindsight, certain assumptions\nwill be made that ultimately prove to be incorrect. As a result of the unanticipated\nhurdles, none of the students on this course were able to make use of the video\nstreams, although in some cases the conventional video was available as an alterna-\ntive. In the circumstances, another attempt at evaluating the video stream was clearly\nessential.\nIn view of the problems encountered with the July cohort, for the next post-\nregistration course held in October 2002 it was decided to encourage students to\naccess the video stream while they were in Southampton, using computers in the host\nschool for this purpose. Out of 24 students, 13 completed an evaluation questionnaire\nwhen they returned for their practical examination. In securing ethical clearance for\nthis research one of the conditions was that students were under no obligation to\nprovide evaluative data. Hence the response was lower than might otherwise have\nbeen the case. Of those who did complete the questionnaire, seven had made further\nuse of the video following an introductory session. Data from these students are\nsummarised in Table 1.\nThese data together with comments from students who had and had not used the\nvideo, in response to an open-ended invitation in the questionnaire, present a mixed\npicture. Some comments were very positive: \nGood video, and for initial revising. I would recommend this video to start students\nrevision off.\nOthers were more critical: \nThe video needs more updating.\nTable 1. Responses from students who had made use of the video in 2002\nStatement\nStrongly agree\/\nagree Neutral\nStrongly disagree\/\ndisagree\nI found it difficult to access the video stream 2 3 2\nThe supporting text helped me to get more \nfrom viewing the stream\n2 3 2\nI enjoyed using the video stream 2 4 1\nI do not think the video enhanced my learning \nabout back care\n2 2 3\nThe video played a significant part in my \nrevision for the practical examination\n1 2 2\nNote: Because of the small numbers involved percentages have not been calculated.\n144 M. Bracher et al.\nThe video was only focused towards a hospital environment therefore came across [as]\nvery unrealistic.\nSome felt that access was the most significant issue, and a number wanted this via the\nInternet. Clearly, if students are to be encouraged to use video streams from \u2018remote\nlocations\u2019, then the development of more flexible approaches to access are critical.\nThis, of course, often has to be balanced against the need to restrict access to bona\nfide users.\nGiven the very small numbers involved and the fact that this is a case study, it is\nclearly important not to claim too much for these findings. That said, the findings do\npoint to the need for further exploration of issues of access and of student attitudes\ntowards moving images as a means of facilitating their learning and the extent to\nwhich the claims of those promoting video streaming are justified.\nEvaluation of undergraduate use of streamed video: 2002\/03 and 2003\/04 \ncohorts\nTwo cohorts of allied health profession undergraduates served as the research\nsubjects for the findings reported in this part of the paper. They were made aware of\nthe video stream in a number of ways. First, it was brought to their attention during\nthe initial lecture of the relevant module. Second, they were reminded during practi-\ncal sessions throughout the module. Finally, they were given instructions regarding\naccess to the video stream in their handbook. It was felt that this would be sufficient\nto maximise student use of the video now that it had been streamed.\nFor the 2002\/03 cohort, evaluation of the video stream formed part of the general\ncourse evaluation. Questions relating to the back care video stream were attached to\nthe end of the course evaluation questionnaire. This was distributed to students in\nMarch 2003, a couple of months before their examination.\nConducting the evaluation in this way had certain advantages in that it avoided\nover-surveying the students and was a more cost-effective option than carrying out a\nseparate survey. However, it did mean that the effective collection of data was depen-\ndent on factors that were not directly connected with the back care video. Moreover,\nethical considerations meant that there was no obligation on students to complete\nthat part of the questionnaire, which covered the video stream. In the event, the\nresults were very disappointing with data being obtained from only 25 students out of\na total of 147 (a response rate of 17%). Because the amount of data collected was\nlimited in scope, it was decided to repeat the exercise with the 2003\/04 cohort. This\ntime the back care video stream was evaluated separately from the course as a whole.\nIn addition, the questionnaire was distributed, completed and collected during a\ntimetabled class in March 2004. It was also kept as short as possible and no attempt\nwas made to gather demographic data from the respondents in order to ensure as\nmuch anonymity as possible, something to which the school\u2019s ethics committee\nattached considerable importance.\nThe changes made for the 2003\/04 cohort resulted in a far higher response rate\nof 79%, with 119 students out of 150 providing data. However, in each case the\nVideo streams for educational purposes 145\npercentage of respondents who had actually accessed the video steam at the time the\nsurvey was conducted was very similar, 24% in 2003 (i.e. five respondents) and 26%\nin 2004 (i.e. 31 respondents). It is very likely that a much larger percentage actually\nviewed the video stream prior to their practical examination. Indeed, as illustrated\nlater, one or two of the students indicated in their responses to the open-ended\nrequest for comments that the questionnaire itself increased the likelihood that they\nwould access the stream. In the circumstances it would have been useful to gather\nfollow-up data once the examinations were over, but this was extremely difficult to\norganise since students immediately departed for their placements. At the same time,\nethical considerations precluded the possibility of seeking to establish whether the\nperformance in the practical examination of those students who had accessed the\nstream was better than those who had not.\nNotwithstanding the shortcomings of the data collection methods employed and\nthe ethical constraints, the findings do offer some interesting insights into student\nattitudes towards, and engagement with, a learning resource of this kind and offer\nsome pointers as to what needs to be done to raise the profile of the back care video\nstream. Of those respondents from the 2002\/03 cohort who had viewed the stream,\nthe amount of time devoted to this activity varied from as little as 30\u201345 minutes to\nas much as three hours. It is not without significance, perhaps, that the student who\nspent the most time viewing the video also had the most favourable views as to its\nvalue. In the case of the 2003\/04 cohort, of those reporting that they had accessed the\nstream, the amount of time spent viewing it varied from 5 to 60 minutes (three\nrespondents did not indicate the time spent viewing the video). The median viewing\ntime was approximately 30 minutes.\nThe responses to a series of evaluative statements of those who had already\nviewed the stream are presented in Table 2. While it is important not to read too\nmuch into the comparisons, given the very small number of respondents in 2003,\nthe patterns that emerge are relatively similar and reasonably encouraging.\nOf those who responded, the majority enjoyed using the video stream and thought\nthat it had enhanced their learning about back care. Against this, however, must be\nset the fact that, although the percentage declined between 2002\/03 and 2003\/04, a\nminority still found it difficult to access the stream. Moreover, many respondents\nwere somewhat equivocal about the supporting text, which suggests that some atten-\ntion should be given to this aspect. Since the text was produced by tutors, perhaps\nusing a student focus group to obtain some insights into what is felt to be most\nappropriate and beneficial from a user perspective would help to realise one of the\nclaimed benefits of streaming, namely the blending of streams with other media\n(Thornhill et al., 2002).\nThose who had not yet accessed the video were asked to indicate, by means of an\nopen-ended question, the reason(s) why they had not done so. Not surprisingly, there\nwere a variety of responses to this question, with some respondents providing multi-\nple reasons. On the basis of these, students can be arranged along a continuum from\nthose who claimed they did not know about the video stream to those who did and\nwere about to use it. Thus, there were those who: \n146 M. Bracher et al.\n\u25cf did not remember being told about the video stream;\n\u25cf had forgotten about the stream;\n\u25cf were not aware of its relevance;\n\u25cf were unsure how to access the stream;\n\u25cf had sought unsuccessfully to access the stream;\n\u25cf had not had the time (the most \u2018popular\u2019 reason);\n\u25cf had other priorities;\n\u25cf did not consider the need to do so was sufficiently pressing; and\n\u25cf were planning to view the stream in the near future.\nA selection of the fuller responses, which are indicative of the variety of reasons for\nfailure to access the stream by the time the survey was conducted, are presented in\nTable 3.\nOf the quotations in Table 3, a clue as to why some students were not aware of the\nvideo comes from one of the 2002\/03 cohort who states (honestly and disarmingly!)\nthat he\/she \u2018probably wasn\u2019t listening at the start of the module\u2019. This suggests that\nwhere resources are deemed to be of particular importance for students, more novel\nand varied ways of bringing them to their attention are required.\nOne particular message that seems to come through is that there was some\nmisunderstanding and confusion over where the video could be accessed. From a\nnumber of comments it would seem that students were under the impression that it\nwas a conventional video and that a video cassette recorder was required. In addi-\ntion, quite a number referred to the difficulty\/impossibility of accessing it from\nhome, since their computers did not have the necessary software or Internet\nconnections. They did not seem to realise that the video stream was a resource that\ncould only used at the university. This suggests that students require further and\nTable 2.

Apart from \u2018more time\u2019, to which a majority referred, and having computers with\nInternet connections, there were broadly three suggestions.\nThe first suggestion can be succinctly expressed as \u2018reminders\u2019. It would seem that\nfor many students simply having information about a learning resource in one or two\nforms is not sufficient. If something is particularly important for their learning then,\nas already indicated, messages need to be constantly reinforced since they are in\ncompetition with many other claims on student attention spans. Associated with this\nis the need for instructions regarding access to be kept constantly in the foreground.\nSecond, a number of respondents suggested that if the video was that important it\nshould be shown, in full or in part, in class time. In the words of two students: \nI will definitely make use of it, but need \u2018encouragement\u2019 to watch it in my own time. I will\nbe more than happy to watch it in lecture times, if it is that important that we watch it.\nTable 3. Selection of reasons why video stream not accessed\nCohort Reason\n2002\/03 I don\u2019t actually remember being told about the video stream and there weren\u2019t any \nreminders. Also I don\u2019t actually have the facilities to watch a video\nNeed to get home\u2014childcare when not necessary to be at uni. Have video at home \n+ notes. May still look at video stream\u2014need to investigate\nWasn\u2019t aware of it until last week (probably wasn\u2019t listening at start of module)\n2003\/04 Haven\u2019t found time yet\u2014everytime I\u2019ve seen the link I\u2019ve been busy doing \nsomething else\nHonestly I completely forgot about the back care video, and actually can\u2019t \nremember being told about it. Also don\u2019t actually know how to use the video \nstream, can\u2019t remember being told how to use it\nIt has not been a priority to look at it yet. I was aware, but was leaving it until other \nwork\/assessments were completed. I formed the opinion that it is something we \ncould look at if we were interested (i.e. not a key part of our learning)\nI think I\u2019ve seen the link for it on the website, but I wasn\u2019t aware that it was relevant \nto us; I didn\u2019t know that it was so closely linked to moving and handling in the first \nyear. I thought it was especially for third years, or something like that anyway\nI have seen a similar video before on this subject, prior to coming to university, as \nwell as completing a research project on the subject. I have been busy preparing for \nexaminations + assignments\nI don\u2019t think I am organised enough to have used this system this early enough \nbefore the examination\nI have had so much work to do and therefore had very little time to make use of the \nvideo. Also, with the revision I am concentrating on at the moment it hasn\u2019t been \nrelevant\n148 M. Bracher et al.\nI do intend to watch it but if it was either shown in lectures or made compulsory then it\nwould be made use of.\nThis, of course, conflicts with the notion of self-managed and\/or independent learn-\ning, but it seems to be a particular issue for some students. That said, quite a number\nrecognised the video\u2019s value for revision purposes and, as previously mentioned,\nindicated that they would definitely be accessing it in the near future.\nA third suggestion, which was not always articulated as clearly as others, but none-\ntheless should not be disregarded, concerns the video\u2019s usefulness. A few respondents\nimplied that if they were going to devote some of their study time to viewing the\nstream, they needed to be assured that it would be time well spent.\nTo end on a positive note, as one respondent commented: \nI\u2019m afraid I wasn\u2019t aware of the video stream, however this questionnaire has drawn it to\nmy attention, and I shall make sure I make use of this information.\nThus, at the very least, the evaluative research provided useful \u2018publicity\u2019 for the back\ncare video stream. Whether or not it actually increased the number of students view-\ning the video, however, is not known.\nIssues and concerns\nWhat these findings illustrate, above all else, is that streaming must not be seen as an\nend in itself. If it is to be used effectively to enhance student learning, careful consid-\neration has to be given to both logistical and pedagogic issues. Moreover, it is desirable\nto keep the situation under constant review and to recognise that as much, if not more,\ncan be learnt from what might be considered failures as successes.\nAccess\nFrom a logistical point of view the key concern is ease of access. Unless students can\naccess video streams more easily than conventional videos, their potential as a learn-\ning resource is unlikely to be realised. Ideally this means access at home, but until\nbroadband is the norm access via a public workstation or alternatively providing\nstudents with the video streams and supporting material on CD-roms are the most\nfeasible options. To facilitate the former, but still restrict access to bona fide users, a\nmore flexible mechanism than the IP address system, such as an Athens password, is\nrequired. In addition, there is a pressing need for more libraries to join the UK\nComputing Plus Scheme. Even for campus-based students, building time into their\nwork schedules for accessing videos has to be encouraged and the message reinforced\nat regular intervals.\nEngagement\nHowever, overcoming problems of access to video streams, for which tutors and\neducational institutions must accept primary responsibility, is only a necessary, not a\nVideo streams for educational purposes 149\nsufficient, condition for effective learning from such streams. In other words, simply\nensuring that students can view the video does not guarantee that they will do so,\naccess is not the same as accessing, or if they do access it that their learning will be\nenhanced. Equal attention needs to be given to motivational and pedagogic issues.\nSeveral published case studies emphasise the fact that the impact of video streams as\nlearning resources can be limited by students\u2019 enthusiasm to use them. Limited\nstudent motivation to use online resources was highlighted by Zenios (2002) as a key\nfactor, and Green et al. (2003) found that streamed video resources did not appeal to,\nor were not adequately accessible by, a significant proportion of student nurses. In\nthe case of the back care video, the most important of the motivational issues relate\nto the: \n\u25cf accuracy and contemporaneity of the content;\n\u25cf availability of electronic guides\/tutors by the side;\n\u25cf provision of formative feedback; and\n\u25cf means of confirming and celebrating learning.\nAs further experience is gained in the use of the back care video stream to support\nlearning, particularly with large numbers of undergraduates for whom access is less\nof an issue, it is intended to fine tune the contributions it makes to learning. From\nthe evidence gathered so far, it is likely that various versions of the supporting text\nwill emerge each targeted at a particular group of learners (e.g. undergraduate\/post-\nregistration, nurses\/occupational therapists\/physiotherapists) and addressing their\nspecific needs. The flexibility offered by video steaming makes this a feasible pros-\npect. Another facility that will be of considerable benefit for tutors, as it becomes\navailable, is the ability to \u2018cut and paste\u2019 from videos and to construct their own\n\u2018play-lists\u2019. This will enable them to tailor images to the particular needs of their\nstudents as they have traditionally been able to do with written material.\nConclusion\nWith the increasing availability of streamed videos as learning resources, it is incum-\nbent upon educationalists to ensure that they give due attention to not only the intrin-\nsic quality of their content, but also what is required to maximise their contribution\nto learning. What the research reported in this paper has shown is that if the effort\nexpended in producing the resource is to pay dividends, then issues of access and\nengagement must not be ignored. They will not take care of themselves. Indeed, using\nstreaming media successfully will also require both lecturers and students to change\ntheir traditional roles and expectations. As suggested elsewhere (Shephard, 2003), in\nsome respects students will need to become more \u2018independent\u2019, but teaching staff\nwill need to work less independently as they embrace the practicalities of teamwork.\nDelivery of resources as demanding as streaming video requires a significant number\nof professionals to work together, as a team.\nHere, the importance of having a proactive, collaborative strategy cannot be over-\nstated. Many elements of such a strategy are evident in both the current practice and\n150 M. Bracher et al.\nresearch findings reported in this paper. The provision of clear guidance with respect\nto technical matters, the use of multiple channels of communication to convey key\nmessages about the availability and value of the resource and demonstrations or\n\u2018tasters\u2019 are all of significance in this respect. In other words, what some would regard\nas the \u2018softer\u2019 aspects of technological developments should not go by default.\nReferences\nClarke, R. & Croft, P.
