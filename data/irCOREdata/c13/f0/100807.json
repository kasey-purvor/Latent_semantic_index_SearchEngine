INTRODUCTION\nCarbon nanotubes \u0001CNTs\u0002 consisting of sp2-hybridized\ncarbon atoms are cylindrical structures with a diameter rang-\ning from 1 nm to several tens of nanometers and length\nscales from tens to hundreds of micrometers. High electronic\nconductivity and chemical stability, together with good me-\nchanical strength, are some of the excellent features of\nCNTs. Because of these unique properties, there is a belief\nthat the field emission display \u0001FED\u0002 technology making use\nof CNTs as electron emitter could be a threat to the domi-\nnance of liquid crystal displays in the flat-panel display\narena, provided suitable cathode materials can be produced.1\nThe FED is the technology of choice for ultrahigh definition,\nwide-screen displays and televisions.2\u20135 However, the effec-\ntive use of CNTs is yet to be established and is currently a\nsignificant challenge. FED manufacturing requires CNT to\nbe grown in precise positions to predetermined sizes and\ndensities; height, diameter, and tip sharpness affect emission\nvoltage, while density affects current.6 One drawback is the\ndegradation during emission associated with the electronic\nresistance at the interface between the carbon tubes and the\nsubstrate, which restricts their use in commercial emission\ndevices.7,8 The presence of heating at the film\/substrate in-\nterface generates different mechanical stresses on the film,\nwhich leads to an increase in the resistance and\/or the volt-\nage barrier damage during the electron emission process over\nextended periods.\nRecently, an electrode structure composed of composites\nof CNTs based on carbon substrates with a three-dimensional\n\u00013D\u0002 structure9\u201311 has been proposed as a route to avoiding\nthe above-mentioned drawbacks. In this paper we present yet\nanother 3D textured cathode combining CNTs and vitreous\ncarbon \u0001VCarbon\u0002 having microcavities to obtain a reproduc-\nible electron emission current at low fields. The carbon-\nbased composites were developed by growing the CNTs onto\nVCarbon substrates having microcavities.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\nIn this work the CNTs were mounted on the surface of\nmonolithic VCarbon via the decomposition of methanol on\nmetallic particles of cobalt and manganese. The anchoring of\nthe catalysts on the VCarbon was carried out by dipping the\nfelt into an equimolar Co\/Mn acetate solution, followed by\ndrying at 80 \u00b0C under ambient conditions. Reduction in the\nacetate salts to the corresponding metals occurred during the\nheating of the felt under N2 atmosphere, which was the gas\nused to transport the methanol vapor at 50 \u00b0C to the oven at\na flow rate of 0.2 ml min\u22121. The CNT growth temperature\nand time were 650 \u00b0C and 20 min, respectively. To remove\nthe catalysts from the tips of the tubes or the catalysts that\nwere not active for methanol decomposition, the electrodes\nwere submitted to concentrated HCl treatment under reflux\nand magnetic stirring for 6 h and then dried under vacuum at\n100 \u00b0C. The mass of CNTs in the composite was 45.8 mg.\nThe emission characterization was carried out using a FE\nscanning electron microscope \u0001FE-SEM\u0002 having a setup for\nelectrical characterization, that is, a stainless steel sphere an-\node \u00010.5 cm diameter\u0002 with vacuum chamber of about 2\n\u000210\u22126 Torr. The distance between the semisphere anode\nand the CNT\/VCarbon cathode was controlled by a stepper\nmotor with a minimum step of 2.5 \u0001m. The emission of the\nelectrode was also studied using a phosphor electrode under\nsimilar vacuum, and two Teflon foils \u0001500 \u0001m thick\u0002 were\nused as separators between CNT\/VCarbon and the phosphor\nelectrode.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 1 shows microimages for the VCarbon and a typi-\ncal CNT\/VCarbon electrode acquired using the FE-SEM mi-\ncroscope. The SEM pictures show that there are large\namounts of CNTs with a cotton-like appearance mainly on\nthe outer surface of the VCarbon substrates \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004. It is\npossible to see that the CNTs abundantly cover the walls of\nthe majority of the cavities \u0003Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0004. In some CNTs it is\npossible to see a dense agglomeration of tubes, with large\ndeposits of cotton-like CNTs \u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004. The SEM pictures\nsuggest that catalyst dispersion used for CNT growth was\nable to concentrate a large number of catalytic particles on\nthe outer surface of VCarbon, thus providing many sites for\nCNT growth. The cotton-like appearance of these deposits\nalso indicates the presence of a large quantity of amorphous\ncarbon. In fact, it is well known that amorphous carbon in\nCNT samples are often found as a binder connecting the\nCNTs, as can be observed in a work devoted to the study of\nCNT purification.12 Another aspect that should be mentioned\nregards the CNT types that are expected for this sample. For\nthe CNT growth conditions applied in the preparation of the\ncomposite studied in this work, the presence of cup-stacked\nnanostructures has been observed systematically.11 A system-\natic study shows the influence of catalyst dimension as well\nas reasons as to why the methanol is able to yield this type of\nnanostructure.\nFigure 2 shows the behavior of the FE current for typical\ncotton-like CNT deposits found in Fig. 1, probed by a tung-\nsten tip assembled inside of the chamber of SEM. In this\nsetup, the composite was grounded using a silver epoxy.\nThe emission curves of cotton-like CNTs shown in Figs.\n3\u0001a\u0002 and 3\u0001c\u0002 are similar even when the deposit undergoes a\nsmall rotation and the gaps are different \u0001Fig. 2\u0002. When only\nthe gap distance is increased \u0003Figs. 3\u0001b\u0002 and 3\u0001c\u0002\u0004, changes in\nthe threshold field Eth \u0001emission current of 1 nA\u0002 are ob-\nserved, whose values are found at about 25\u201335 V \u0001m\u22121\n\u0001Fig. 2\u0002. In addition, hysteresis on the I-V curves \u0001Fig. 2\u0002,\nassigning the difference in the applied fields between the\nupward and downward voltage cycles, disappears when the\ngap decreases from 8.2 to 6.7 \u0001m.\nFigure 2 shows that in the cotton-like deposits, the emis-\nsion occurs at very high Eth because of the screening effect\nfrom the denser CNTs. Another interesting aspect is that for\nthe gaps 5.4 and 8.2 \u0001m \u0003Figs. 3\u0001b\u0002 and 3\u0001c\u0002, respectively\u0004,\nthe emission current versus the applied voltage is similar,\nsuggesting that the enhancement factor in the cotton-like de-\nposit is not constant since at x=8.2 and 5.4 \u0001m the Eth are\nidentical.\nFIG. 1.

FE current vs voltage curves of typical cotton-like CNT deposits\nfound on the cavities of the CNT\/VCarbon composite collected with W tip\ninside the SEM at gaps of 5.4 \u0001\u0001\u0002, 6.7 \u0001 \u0002, and 8.2 \u0001m \u0001\u0002\u0002.\n054303-2 Matsubara, Rosolen, and Silva J.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nTypical FE current curves of the CNT\/VCarbon compos-\nite and VCarbon alone probed by using a semisphere are\nshown in Figs. 4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001b\u0002, respectively. The CNT\/\nVCarbon composite is able to provide a current of 1 nA at a\nthreshold field from 2.4 to 2.1 V \u0001m\u22121 within a gap range\nfrom 200 to 400 \u0001m. The CNT\/VCarbon curves also present\na very low hysteresis effect. On the other hand, VCarbon\npresents an Eth at about 1 V \u0001m\u22121, which changes slightly\nfrom 352.5 to 552.5 \u0001m, but has a large hysteresis mainly\nwhen the gap distance reaches 652.5 \u0001m. Therefore, the\nVCarbon substrate appears to give unstable emission prob-\nably due to its geometry, which has many edges and corners\nthat should have a very high enhancement factor. In fact, for\nsmaller gaps than those shown in Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002, it was impossible\nto measure the emission because the samples generated\nmany electrical sparks, clearly showing very high current\ndensities being the sources from the cathodes.\nThese results show that the I-V curve of CNT\/VCarbon\nis due to the contribution from two emitters: the VCarbon\nsubstrate and the CNTs on the surface and cavities of the\nmonolithic VCarbon. However, in the CNT\/VCarbon com-\nposite the CNT seems to play a significant role since its\npresence completely changed the emission behavior of the\nVCarbon substrate. This suggests that the CNTs are probably\nfunctioning as emission channels for electrons extracted\nfrom the VCarbon.\nThe stability of the CNT\/VCarbon composite studied in\nFig. 4 was also probed as a function of time. Figure 5 shows\nthe behavior of the emission current of CNT\/VCarbon versus\ntime at 800 V for a gap distance of 200 \u0001m using the\nsphere-to-plane geometry. During a period of 24 h, it was\npossible to see that the CNT\/VCarbon electrode underwent\ncurrent variations. When the experiment was interrupted, the\ncurrent was about 28% lower than in the first point \u0001Fig. 5\u0002.\nWe believe that this variation is mainly associated with the\nelimination of impurities in the sample \u0001e.g., amorphous car-\nbon, functional groups\u0002. The electrical contact between the\nCNT and the surface of the carbon substrate should have a\nsmall electrical resistance since both materials are carbon-\nbased.\nFinally, Fig. 6 shows the image of the electron FE of a\nCNT\/VCarbon disk probed by the phosphor counter-\nelectrode at increasing applied voltage \u0001gap of 1 mm\u0002 after\nthe stability test was carried out \u0001Fig. 5\u0002. The phosphor CNT\/\nVCarbon display has a geometric area of about 0.7 cm2,\nassembled with a gap of 1 mm. At 800 V only a small bright\npoint on the phosphor screen can be seen. With increasing\nfield, other points are observed and the previous ones have\nan increased brightness. It is worth noting that the sites have\na similar shape, resembling the cavities of VCarbon depicted\nin Fig. 1. This means that the emission in the CNT\/VCarbon\nFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\ncomposite is determined by several emission sites whose\nproperties depend probably on the amount of CNTs on each\ncavity. In Fig. 2 it can be seen that the electron emission in\nthe cotton-like CNTs \u0001high concentration of nanotubes\u0002 oc-\ncurs at much higher Eth compared with well-dispersed CNTs\nor less concentrated nanotubes. The cavities that contain a\nsmaller concentration of CNTs on their surfaces should emit\nan effective field lower than that of the sites rich in high\ndensity, cotton-like CNTs. Thus, we believe that the cavities\nof CNT\/VCarbon are the main emission sites in the sample\nbecause of the differences between the Eth values of the\ncotton-like and composite samples \u0001Figs. 2 and 5\u0002. In the\ncotton-like deposits with high concentration of CNTs and\namorphous carbon, the screening effect is expected to be\nlarger than in the cavity sites.\nThe mechanism of electron emission in the CNT\/\nVCarbon electrode is very interesting because both carbon of\ncomposite are electron emitter. The VCarbon on its own is a\nvery good emitter as seen in the data. However, the data also\nshow the emission is not steady and has fluctuations. Now, in\nthe case of the CNT grown on VCarbon, a larger beta factor\ndue to the CNT growth on VCarbon in places should be\nexpected, and some of the sharper tips of the VCarbon will\nhave also vaporized. So, though a higher effective beta, the\nvery high betas associated with the substrate would be re-\nmoved. Now, if this is the case as suggested, the gap\ndistance-angular coefficient ratio would expect steadier and\nmore stable current, and maybe some sacrifice to the current\ndensity due to the increased steady state emitting surfaces,\neach screening the other, and therefore also a decrease in the\nthreshold field. This decrease in the threshold field for higher\ncurrent emitting surfaces was observed.13 This could explain\nthe increase in the threshold field and almost steady current\ndensity. The higher beta factors for CNT on CNT were de-\nscribed. Secondary nanotube growth on aligned carbon\nnanofiber arrays for superior FE.14 This kind of mechanism\nseems to be supported by the behavior of slope of ln\u0001I \/V2\u0002\nversus 1 \/V in Fig. 4, where I is emission current and V is the\napplied voltage \u0001Fowler and Nordheim model\u0002. The enhance-\nment factor is proportional to the gap distance-angular coef-\nficient ratio. For CNT\/VCarbon this ratio changes a little\nwith an increase in the anode-cathode distance, while for\nVCarbon the ratio, whose emission current is unstable, it\npresents a maximum at 452.5 \u0001m. This ratio is about 0.023,\n0.020, and 0.021 \u0001m at 200, 300, and 400 \u0001m to CNT\/\nVCarbon and 0.029, 0.082, 0.057, and 0.069 \u0001m V at 352.5,\n452.5, 552.5, and 652 mm to VCarbon.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work CNT\/VCarbon composites were prepared\nand shown to have good cold FE electrode properties. It is\nnot an easy task to determine the emission area for the CNT\/\nVCarbon composite due to its complex structure. Although\nthere are no conditions to provide an accurate value of the\ncurrent density of the CNT\/VCarbon electrodes, we have\nused the equation proposed in Refs. 12 and 15, which gave\nus an effective emission area of about 11\u000210\u22124 cm2 at\n200 \u0001m. By using this area value, the CNT\/VCarbon\nsamples provided an emission of about 4 mA cm\u22122 \u0001Fig. 5\u0002.\nHowever, we believe that the real emission area of our elec-\ntrode is smaller than that determined using the equation A\n=2\u0004Rd\u000121\/n\u22121\u0002, where A is the emission area, n\u000518, R is\nthe radius of the anode 2.5 mm, and d is the anode-cathode\nseparation. The conversion of the sphere area into a planar\nsurface is a good approximation for flat electrodes based on\nthin films. The electrode studied here presents several cavi-\nties filled partially by CNTs, which is, therefore, a very dif-\nferent situation that is found in large area planar measure-\nment configurations, where often it is used as higher\nthreshold fields for probing FE measurements. In fact, when\nflat electrodes are probed in the same setup, which was used\nto study the CNT\/VCarbon, higher emission current density\ncan be obtained without burning of the phosphor electrode or\noverloading of current detection, as what occurred in the case\nof the composite. Thus, the composite prepared in this work\ncould open unconventional routes for the development of\nelectron FE devices. The fact that the composite cavities act\npredominantly as emitter sites is an interesting result since it\ncould to be used to mount nanotubes with the aim of decreas-\ning the screening effect. In this sense, the CNT loading is a\nkey factor to improving the composite performance for elec-\ntron FE devices. A better dispersion of CNTs in the cavities\nshould reduce the Eth of the composite, as observed for the\nCNT\/felt samples already cited in the literature.9\u201311 Several\nchemical methods might be used to disperse catalysts used in\nthe CNT growth on VCarbon substrates. The composite can\nbe submitted to chemical treatments for purification or, yet,\nincorporation of chemical species able to reduce the work\nfunctions of CNTs.\nFIG. 6. \u0001Color online\u0002 Electron FE pictures of a CNT\/VCarbon disk probed\nby the phosphor counter-electrode at increasing applied voltage \u0001gap of\n1mm\u0002.
