In doing so, the article indicates ways in which the process of self-production \nin contemporary consumer societies may be less reflexive, and more socially \nconservative, than some accounts of individualization would suggest.  \n \nKeywords \nappearance; class; consumption; consumer culture; identity; individualization; gender; \nself-production; young adults \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nIn contemporary consumer societies, images of ideal bodies form the backdrop of \neveryday life, work is often a matter of making good impressions, and the market \noverflows with tools for reshaping appearances. In short: \u2018looking good\u2019 matters. \nAttention to appearances is inseparable from the broader emphasis on identity \nproduction in the contemporary period, variously described as late, high, post or \nsecond modernity. Accounts of individualization draw attention to the ways in which \nidentity has shifted over the course of modernity from a fixed set of characteristics \ndetermined by birth and ascription, to a reflexive, ongoing project shaped by \nappearance and performance (Bauman, 2000; Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002; \nGiddens, 1991). Individuals, free to choose their paths towards self-realization, are \nthen faced with a loss of security; without fixed rules, individuals are constantly at \nrisk of getting it wrong, and anxiety attends each choice. The increasing attention to \nthe problem of identity has been attended by the ascendancy of a consuming way of \nlife. In the form of countless products, therapeutic experts and self-help media, \nconsumer culture offers both the problems and the solutions to self-production (e.g. \nEwen, 1999; McGee, 2005).  \nIdentity formation is a lifelong process (Cherrier and Murray, 2007), and the work \nof self-production is common (although not uniform) across social groups in \ncontemporary consumer societies. Nevertheless, young people\u2019s perceived affinity \nfor, and strategic targeting by the industries of consumption (Holt and Griffin, 2003; \nKjeldgaard, 2003; McRobbie, 1994; Miles, 2000) make them a particularly fruitful \n 2 \n \nlens through which to examine the nexus of consumption, identity and \nindividualization. In working on their appearances, young adults negotiate the \ncompeting demands of forging an identity in a consumer society\u2014to fit in and be \naccepted, but at the same time stand out as an individual. It is this dynamic that drives \nself-innovation and self-production, as much as it drives the logic of fashion in \nconsumer culture (Gronow, 1997).  \nIn addition, work on the self and identity may be emphasized at particular life \nstages and precipitated by specific life events, such as new parenthood, redundancy, \nor sudden illness. Again, young adults constitute a significant group through which to \nexamine the dynamics of self-production (O\u2019Connor, 2006)\u2014their liminal position \nbetween adolescence and full adulthood, and new experiences and contacts upon \nleaving the family for higher education or employment open up possibilities for a \nrenegotiation of self-identity (Karp et al., 1998). That freedom, however, is charged \nwith risk, anxiety and opportunities for failure.  \nThis article draws from a small sample of semi-structured interviews with British \nyoung adults that explored the problem of \u2018looking good\u2019 and focused on uses of, and \nattitudes toward a range of practices, such as clothing styles, grooming and styling \nhabits, and exercise and diet regimes. The specific focus, here, is on how such \nmaterial practices are intertwined with a range of problems that are emblematic of \nboth reflexive identity projects and the consumer context within which they take \nplace. We consider how respondents\u2019 discursive strategies for discussing such \npractices resonate with theoretical accounts of individualization and identity. The \narticle proceeds with an overview of the problem of self-production and its link to \nconsumer culture, before turning to a discussion of the interviews. \n \nThe Problem of Self-Production \n \nWriting at the start of the twentieth century, Simmel declared the \u2018struggle \nbetween individuality and generality\u2019 to be the sine qua non of human existence \n(1991: 63). This tension between a quest for distinction and a quest for belonging has \nbeen explored by a number of contemporary authors concerned with the nature of \nidentity and individuality, often connected with the process of modernization. \nModernity\u2019s legacy is to pose to each of us the need to \u2018become what one is\u2019 \n(Bauman, 2000: 32): \nTo put it in a nutshell, \u2018individualization\u2019 consists of transforming human \n\u2018identity\u2019 from a \u2018given\u2019 into a \u2018task\u2019 and charging the actors with the \nresponsibility for performing that task and for the consequences (also the \nside-effects) of their performance. (Bauman, 2000: 31-2) \nSelf-production is thus rendered as a problem in a double-sense\u2014it is a technical \nproblem, and it is problematic. \nFirst, identity is a technical problem, with which particular tools, solutions, \nexperts, and rules are associated. This is an acknowledgement of the historical \nspecificity of the individual: it is only when identity becomes an open question that \nmust be addressed, rather than a closed category that is assumed and ascribed, that we \ncan speak of an individual in the modern sense (Bauman, 1996; Beck and Beck-\nGernsheim, 2002; Foucault, 1986; Giddens, 1991). The development of \u2018the \nindividual\u2019 is therefore inseparable from the development of the ways in which an \nindividual takes up and works on the self as a project. Foucault defines these as \n\u2018technologies of the self,\u2019 the means: \n 3 \n \nwhich permit individuals to effect by their own means or with the help of \nothers a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, \nthoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to transform themselves in \norder to attain a certain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or \nimmortality. (Foucault 1988: 18) \nThe problem of self-production involves the individual recognizing and \nacknowledging the body and self as flawed, inadequate or at least incomplete, and \nidentifying areas for transformation and the appropriate tools, practices and experts to \nperform that work. The self, in other words, becomes a do-it-yourself project (Hitzler \n1988 in Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002: 3). \nOur respondents made reference to various means by which they judged or \nmeasured themselves, suggesting the ways in which individuals take up themselves as \nDIY projects. For example: \nI\u2019m pretty happy with [my body] most of the time, but it doesn\u2019t help that I \nlive with seven boys. When we go out, I know that girls always look at \nthem not me, and I think its \u2018cause I\u2019m short. \u2026My mates are more good \nlooking, like girls always come up to them, so I feel a bit short and \nunattractive next to them. \u2026So when it comes to girls, I definitely think \nI\u2019m disadvantaged because I\u2019m short and a bit big. (Nick, 22)1 \n \nWhen I look in the mirror, I find myself looking at my reflection quite a \nlot, even though I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a vain person. And when I get up in the  \nmorning and get out of bed, especially because I\u2019ve got a big mirror right \nthere, I do find myself looking in the mirror at my stomach and looking at \nhow flabby it is. But I do compare myself to other people. I don\u2019t do it \nvery often but I guess subconsciously we do it all the time. (Katy, 20) \nAs Balsamo (1996) suggests with regard to cosmetic surgery, the problematization of \nthe body typically involves modes of surveillance, confession, and inscription. The \ntwo examples, above, suggest the interplay between images, ideals and modes of \nvisibility in the process of self-surveillance; while Nick examines himself compared \nto his housemates, through the eyes of prospective mates, Katy measures herself \nthrough the filter of gender norms (including the normative suspicion of females as \nvain or self-obsessed). For both, this surveillance gives rise to a confession or \nacknowledgement that the body does not measure up, and an inscription on the body \nof the dominant cultural ideology regarding gender and appearance, through a variety \nof appearance and body work practices such as working out, styling one\u2019s hair and \napplying makeup.  \nAs much as DIY identities are couched in highly individualistic terms\u2014in \nadvertising rhetoric as well as some theoretical accounts\u2014they remain historically-\nspecific, deeply social identities (Alcoff, 2003; Hall, 1994). The norms against which \nthe self is assessed, and the means by which the gap between self and norm is \naddressed, precede and exist independently of any given individual (which is not to \nimply that such norms and tools are static and unchanging). Consumption, as a \nprimary (but never the sole) context of self-production, makes available certain \ncategories and technologies of the self that enable the construction and expression of \nidentity while also circumscribing an individual\u2019s flexibility, reflexivity and \ncreativity. \nSecond, the problem of self-production is problematic. The quests for distinction \nand belonging are shaped by assurances, opportunities and rewards, as well as risks, \nchallenges and penalties. Self-production is fraught with anxiety\u2014and it is this issue \n 4 \n \non which the article focuses. Such anxiety stems from the historical weakening of \ntraditional sources of authority and identity ascription (e.g. family, class, religion, \nwork), leaving the individual faced with an expanding array of choices. Yet, every \nchoice is a choice that may go wrong; individuals are responsible not only for \nchoosing, but also for the consequences of their choices.  \nIn a reflexive modernity (Giddens, 1991) in which identity and self-production are \nindividual tasks and responsibilities, it is little wonder that consumption has acquired \nsuch prominence in daily life (and academic research). Multiple historical factors and \ncontingencies underlie the perceived shift from a culture of production to one of \nconsumption, including the mobilization (through advertising, marketing, and so \nforth) of mass consumption as a response to advances made in mass production; the \nflourishing of a particular subjectivity that prized novelty, sensations, and fantasy; and \nthe growth of a middle class and its need for tools to define and defend their new class \nposition (Bourdieu, 1984; Campbell, 1987; Ewen, 1976; Martin, 1999). Among such \nfactors is the resonance between the particular qualities of consumption and the \nperceived antinomy, between distinction and belonging, characteristic of modern \nindividuality: \nModern man acquires the right and freedom to be alone, but the existential \ncondition of separateness is simultaneously a lack, activating the \nindividualized utopias of perfection. And the remarkable thing is that both \nmoments of modern self-building are supplied by the supplement-\ngenerator of modern consumption. (Falk, 1994: 145) \nConsumption provides the tools and opportunities to negotiate Simmel\u2019s tension \nbetween individuality and generality: goods can be used as \u2018both fences and bridges\u2019 \n(Douglas and Isherwood, 1996: xv) to display distinction and membership.  \nEarly cultural studies research was, in many ways, a response to the Frankfurt \nSchool\u2019s pessimistic analysis of consumption and mass culture (e.g. Adorno and \nHorkheimer, 1976; Marcuse, 1964). With attention given to a range of activities and \npositionalities, from spectacular subcultures to the mundane practices of everyday \nlife, cultural studies scholars have explored the intersections of consumption and \nidentity, providing accounts of how individuals make use of the commodities \navailable to them, actively negotiating, reformulating and rejecting prescribed \nmeanings and uses through, for example, tactics, bricolage and symbolic creativity (de \nCerteau, 1984; Fiske, 1989; Hebdige, 1979; Willis, 1990). This conceptualization of \nconsumption as a creative, productive process has become an important point of \nconsensus in socio-cultural studies of consumption, tempered both by warnings \nagainst an overly-romantic, or dangerously conservative notion of the creative, \nsovereign agent (e.g. Clarke, 1991; McGuigan, 1998), and by acknowledgements of \nglobal\/local differences (e.g. Howes, 1996; Pilkington and Johnson, 2003; Sandikci \nand G\u00fcliz, 2002).  \nConsumption both enables and constrains the construction of identities, and the \nnexus of consumption, identity and individualization is not unproblematic. Three \nproblems are of particular salience to our discussion of the interview transcripts. First, \nthere is a tension between the singular and the mass. Commodities set up the seeming \nparadox of locating uniqueness in and through objects that are available on a largely \nindiscriminate basis, enabling processes of emulation and belonging while also \nrestraining self-expression with the threat of conformity. Second, consumption elides \nand reproduces class. Despite the advertising rhetoric of equality and free choice \n(fuelled by consumer credit), and the heralding of the end of class as an explanatory \nsocial variable in some accounts of individualization (e.g. Beck, 1986), the objects, \n 5 \n \nspaces and times of consumption are more and less available to different groups, \nenabling processes of distinction while also restraining who is able to participate, and \nhow, thereby reproducing class positions (Bourdieu, 1984). Third, like class, gender \nmediates the ways in which consumption is accessed and practiced (Scanlon, 2000). \nThe consuming vision of identity production is one in which attention to and \ninvestment in bodily appearances is paramount (Baudrillard, 1998; Ewen, 1999), \nenabling identity work (as the body, unlike the psyche, is an accessible site of work) \nwhile also restraining participants through gendered norms regarding the \nappropriateness and exchange value of self-attention and self-presentation.  \n \nLooking Good: Thematic Analysis of the Interviews \n \nThe article draws from interviews with a small sample of British young adults: 3 \nmale, 5 female; aged 19-24 (average age 22); white and middle class. All of the \nrespondents were undergraduate students or recent graduates of a university in the \nMidlands. Recruitment and interviewing were carried out by the second author, using \npersonal contacts and snowball sampling in order to establish an immediate level of \ntrust between interviewer and respondent (Atkinson and Flint, 2001); this was felt to \nbe beneficial given the personal nature of the questions, which included respondents\u2019 \nassessments of and anxieties about their appearance. We take the interviews to be \nboth a reflection on self-production, and an active moment in the narrativizing of the \nself (Giddens, 1991). \nThe discussion of the themes below is concerned primarily with issues of class \nand gender; this should not be taken as an indication that ethnicity does not mediate \nthe link between consumption and identity (e.g. Chin, 2001; Lamont and Molnar, \n2001; Zukin, 2004). However, unlike in some working class white subcultures, in \nwhich ethnicity is explicitly deployed in order to signal difference from other \nsubcultures (Nayak, 2003), ethnicity was unremarkable for our respondents. That is, \nrespondents were not self-conscious about ethnicity and did not reflect upon it \nbecause of their ethnic membership (Bottero, 2004; Dyer, 1996; cf. Holt and Griffin, \n2003). If whiteness was largely invisible to our respondents, it suggests that \nindividuals may be less reflexive about\u2014and more conservative of\u2014some of the very \ncategories (such as ethnicity) that individualization is assumed to undermine and self-\nproduction is assumed to actively negotiate\u2014a point to which we will return. \nUnlike much cultural studies research that focuses upon \u2018peripheral\u2019 youth, our \nsample\u2014white, middle class, university-educated\u2014is taken from a \u2018core\u2019 or \ndominant group (Pilkington and Johnson, 2003). Membership in a dominant social \ngroup (in this case, by virtue of class and ethnicity) does not preclude feelings of \ndiscomfort, unease, exclusion (Bottero, 2004; cf. Aries and Seider, 2005). While \n(economic) access to consumption is less of an issue than for peripheral youth \n(Kjeldgaard, 2003), human relations are hierarchical, and white, middle class youth \nhave neither standardized nor uncomplicated experiences negotiating the intersection \nof consumption and identity. Our concern is with exploring the links between the \ndiscursive strategies respondents used when talking about identity, style and \nappearance, and theoretical accounts of the consumption, identity and \nindividualization nexus.  \nInterview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic text analysis method (King, \n2004; Titscher et al., 2000), combining the use of deductive coding (based on generic \ntopics covered in the interviews, and our interest in material practices) and inductive \ncoding following a Grounded Theory approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). Several \n 6 \n \ninterrelated themes emerged from this analysis, of which four are addressed here. The \nfirst centres around the question of style, highlighting the dynamic tension between \nstanding out and fitting in and setting the stage for the remaining themes: the problem \nof conforming; the desire for confidence; and the negotiation of gender. Pseudonyms \nare used to refer to the individual participants.  \n \nThe question of style \nEach interview began with the question: \u2018How would you describe your personal \nstyle?\u2019 Two patterns in the responses were of particular interest. The first concerned \nthe use of style as a touchstone through which respondents assessed their progress. \nReference was commonly made to the changes in personal style between high school \nand university (particularly with the end of school uniforms creating new \npossibilities\u2014and responsibilities\u2014to assemble outfits), and over the course of the \nuniversity experience (particularly regarding the influence of peers, who were \ncredited with introducing respondents\u2014female and male\u2014to new styles and modes of \nappearance work). Such remarks are suggestive of the respondents\u2019 liminal life stage \nand the ongoing process of identity formation, for which style may serve as a daily \npractice and reflexive mode of assessment. \nThe second pattern in the responses affirmed the complexity of the concept of \nstyle. On the one hand, style or stylization is a creative process by which goods are \nassembled, appropriated and given new meanings, potentially as an act of overt \nresistance (Hebdige, 1979). On the other hand, style is a rational means of coping \nwith the proliferation of material culture (Simmel, 1991); style enables individuals to \nopt into broad taste categories rather than having to make endless taste choices\u2014a \nview echoed in the promotion of branded goods as a means to reduce risk and \nstreamline choice. For respondents, the meaning of style often shifted over the course \nof the interview, at times connoting individuality, while at other times blurring with \ntrendiness and fashionableness, and connotations of a mass mentality. \nStyle can thus act as a crucible for the individual\u2019s active negotiation of the \ntension between the quests for individuality and belonging. For example, Katy insists \nthat she does not keep up with the latest fashions, but instead looks at her friends and \nthe general trends: \nI hate to be a sheep, but you do see people wear something that a year ago, \nyou\u2019d go, \u2018Oh my god, that\u2019s horrible,\u2019 then a year later I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, \nget me a pair.\u2019 (Katy, 20) \nRyan, meanwhile, describes his style as \u2018cool, bit odd, but still cool\u2019: \nMy style\u2019s based on independence. \u2026At the moment, it\u2019s very difficult not \nto be influenced by society and community, and if you\u2019re not, then you\u2019re \ngoing to be excluded from it, which I don\u2019t want to be. I want to be \ninvolved. At the same time, I don\u2019t want to follow. But it\u2019s pretty hard not \nto, so I try and come up with my own sort of stuff, so you kind of balance \nit by being included but being someone who people say, \u2018Yeah, he\u2019s \ndifferent, he\u2019s cool, he\u2019s not your average Joe Bloggs walking down the \nstreet.\u2019 (Ryan, 22) \nKaty and Ryan highlight the risks of creating and expressing an identity. The question \nof style raises two of the central struggles in self-production\u2014to fit in without being \noverly-conformist (\u2018a sheep\u2019; someone who follows) and thus rendering yourself \ninvisible (\u2018your average Joe Bloggs\u2019); and, at the same time, to stand out without \nbeing excluded as marginal or deviant.  \n 7 \n \nStyle is a combinatorial process involving choosing, assembling, and using, which \nprovides opportunities to carve an \u2018individual\u2019 style out of \u2018mass\u2019 objects. Style \nrequires assessments of taste, which are then attributed to objects and, in turn, their \npossessors (Bourdieu, 1984). Such judgements are not fixed, but shift with the winds \nof fashion and social consensus so that styles always run the risk of being out-of-style \n(or, for those who engage in style as \u2018refusal\u2019 (Hebdige, 1979: 3), the risk of being in \nfashion). As Simmel suggests, style allows the individual to create a distance but, at \nthe same time, when it is dictated from the outside (through fashion), style \nsimultaneously \u2018shows where the limits of the originality of the individual lie\u2019 (1991: \n65). Hence, the question of style poses the problem of conforming. \n \nThe problem of conforming \nYoung adults (and consumers more broadly) must reconcile the inherent \ncontradiction in expressing individuality through mass-produced products, negotiating \nthe risk of conformity while seeking the security of a socially-approved style. Often \nthis results in incongruities within respondents\u2019 accounts, between insistences that \ntheir style is independent of the influences of media, peers or celebrities, and worries \nabout looking good enough to fit in and succeed in social life. Rachel, for example, \ndemonstrates her independence through her consumer choices: \nObviously, I want to belong to a group, but I don\u2019t mind being a bit \ndifferent from people. I think as I\u2019m getting more confident and \nindependent, I\u2019m liking being a bit more different from others. Like, I \nrecently bought my winter coat, and I bought a bright orange one \u2018cause I \ndon\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s got a bright orange coat. \u2026I\u2019m not really up-to-\ndate with the latest colours and styles in fashion. I just tend to stick to my \nstyle and go out and find it, which is pretty easy because casual jeans and \ntops and trainers are always around in Top Shop and H&M and places. \n(Rachel, 19) \nThe choice of an orange coat may signal to Rachel her individuality, but it is still a \nprescribed choice\u2014the shop offered a limited number of options for the coat, all of \nwhich were considered by the retailer to be the \u2018latest colours\u2019 for the season. \nRachel\u2019s narrative of self-production glosses over the suspicious convenience of \ndiscovering one\u2019s sovereign taste represented in the high street shops. Criticisms of \nthe pseudo-individuality of commodities and the illusion of choice (Adorno and \nHorkheimer, 1976) are dealt with through a discursive strategy of individual \nexceptionalism: Rachel\u2019s insistence on what she is not (not up-to-date) allows her to \nexperience buying the coat as an expression of individual preference, rather than the \noutcome of conforming to social forces. \nA related discursive move occurs in Nick\u2019s account of his style, which closely \nlinks clothing choices to music preferences (cf. Willis, 1990). He says he wears \nclothes \u2018that make me feel good, not what other people like,\u2019 describing his style as \n\u2018casual and individual\u2019: \nMost of my clothes are like the kind of clothes that indie bands wear, so \nthe style is fashionable and casual but not too trendy and fashionable. \n\u2026I\u2019ve been into music since I was well young, probably about 10, so I\u2019ve \ngrown up with this style. I\u2019m not one of these that has jumped into the \nindie scene now it\u2019s become trendy and cool. (Nick, 22) \nBoth respondents position fashion in relation to conformism, and distance themselves \nfrom it, preferring to underline their individualistic notion of style. The long-standing \ncommitment to a music scene is mobilized as an inoculation against conformity; Nick \n 8 \n \nframes himself as an exception, much like Rachel. In addition, Nick employs an \nexculpatory strategy, shifting the responsibility and blame for the overlap between his \npersonal style and popular fashion onto more recent (conformist) converts, who have \n\u2018jumped\u2019 onto the popular bandwagon of the indie music scene. This is suggestive of \nthe taste dynamic outlined by Bourdieu (1984), in which the working class prefer the \nfamiliar and popular, while the middle classes prefer the more esoteric or unusual\u2014\nall the better to demonstrate their superior reserves of cultural (if not economic) \ncapital. Bourdieu\u2019s findings point to how choices are made, not what is chosen. Nick \nand other indie fans may choose the same style of clothes, but Nick\u2019s sense of \nauthenticity and individualism stem from his mode of choice, which relies on personal \nknowledge of, and long-standing investment in, the cultural field.  \nAs in Kjeldgaard\u2019s (2003) research on \u2018core\u2019 youth in Denmark, our respondents \nconstruct personal narratives of authenticity that revolve around the reflexive choice \nand assemblage of commodities. Consumer goods such as clothes require an active \nnegotiation of the symbolic (if not material) uses of the item, offering the subjective \nexperience (if not objective reality) of sovereignty (Willis, 1990). This is not to \nsuggest that exceptionalist and exculpatory discursive strategies are simply illusory \nmatters. On the contrary, authenticity is a negotiated, not primitive concept (Cohen, \n1988); the active, reflexive expression of style is essential to the construction of \nclaims to authenticity and individuality, however riddled with inconsistencies those \nclaims may appear from the outside. The process of self-production requires a \nreconciliation at the level of narrative\u2014not material reality\u2014of the contradictions \nbetween the individual and the social: we \u2018seek biographical solutions to systemic \ncontradictions\u2019 (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002: xxii).  \nThis suggests that self-production is inherently a conservative social process, \nreproducing the status quo because it preserves the (illusory) ideal of a coherent, \nsovereign self (cf. McGuigan, 1998). Moreover, the reflexivity regarding fashion that \ngives rise to feelings of authenticity does not extend to reflexivity about the class-\nbased nature of stylistic preferences, reproducing middle class tastes as the taken-for-\ngranted norm\u2014an issue that also arises with regard to the desire for confidence. \n \nThe desire for confidence \nThe third theme arising from the interviews underlines the problematic nature of \nself-production; as a process framed by risk and anxiety, one of the key desired \noutcomes is confidence. In discussing the problem of looking good, respondents \npredominantly focused on their body work practices and anxieties\u2014what they liked \nand disliked about their appearance, their choices in clothes and hairstyles, their daily \ngrooming practices versus preparing for a \u2018night out,\u2019 and their habits and worries \nregarding exercise and diet. However, when asked, \u2018What does looking good mean to \nyou?,\u2019 answers invariably departed from the focus on appearance and instead focused \non attitude:  \nI think things have a lot to do with how people carry themselves and act in \npublic.  \u2026I think it\u2019s important to walk tall and confidently, \u2018cause it says \na lot about a person. People have said I seem a bit intimidating before, and \nI can understand it \u2018cause I am confident with myself\u2026and I let people \nknow it through how I act and behave. \u2026Attractiveness comes down to \npersonal style a lot. Any girl can be pretty if she has style. (Jess, 24) \nHere, style is invoked not as an attribute of particular objects but rather a mode of \nself-presentation. When asked to define what it means to \u2018look good,\u2019 the majority of \nrespondents referred to notions of \u2018being natural\u2019, \u2018just being yourself,\u2019 or \u2018being \n 9 \n \ncomfortable.\u2019 Such comments signal aspirations to a more self-assured, socially-\ncompetent, adult mode of embodiment. It is also, significantly, a middle class mode \nof embodiment (Bourdieu, 1984). The respondents\u2019 discussions of confidence and \nattitude, however, were class-neutral, suggesting that middle class dominance\u2014at \nleast in this respect\u2014is so normalized as to be invisible (Skeggs, 1997). \nFeelings of confidence can override the materiality of the object to produce its \nsymbolic meaning and social cachet. For example: \nI think you just have to be genuinely confident to look good. It doesn\u2019t \nmatter what you wear. \u2026Like this \u2018apple jacket\u2019 I have. \u2026It wasn\u2019t a cool \njacket, but when I wore it out, a lot of people said I pulled it off and it was \ncool. And the thing is, that there are nights when I go out and I\u2019m in a \ngood mood and I\u2019ve had a good day, and things are going right, and you\u2019ll \njust walk into a room and not be worried about what people are thinking \nabout what you\u2019re wearing, \u2018cause you\u2019re just confident and that feeds into \nthem and so therefore what you\u2019re wearing is cool. (Ryan, 22) \nHere, the performative nature of style is underlined. Arnould and Price (2000) outline \ntwo modes of self-making in the context of the consumption. The first concerns \n\u2018authenticating acts,\u2019 instances of symbolic creativity and appropriation that produce \nfeelings of authenticity and individuation. Commodities are tools in self-\nauthentification; this is particularly salient for Ryan, given the jacket\u2019s uniqueness. \nThe jacket provides a conduit for a heightened experience of confidence, as the \nreaction to the jacket then reinforces the sense of confidence that has animated the \nobject in the first place, suggesting a \u2018flow\u2019 experience (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) in \nwhich pleasure is derived from a loss of self-consciousness.  \nThe second mode of self-making is the authoritative performance (Arnould and \nPrice, 2000), in which feelings of community, acceptance and belonging arise from \nshared participation or shared rituals. Particularly revealing are moments when \nauthoritative performances fail; participation turns to empty role playing, and \nconfidence eludes the individual. Katy, for example, highlights a moment in which \nfeelings of confidence and connectedness were lacking, irrespective of the socially-\nesteemed object\u2014a beautiful dress\u2014mediating the social interaction: \nI have real up days, attractive days. Like last night at the ball, I knew I had \na beautiful dress on, but I didn\u2019t feel that attractive. \u2026Some days I go out \nand I walk past men and I go, \u2018Yeah, I look good\u2019 and I know they\u2019re \nlooking at me, and it\u2019s a really bigheaded thing to say. But last night \npeople kept coming up to me and saying I looked lovely, but I didn\u2019t feel it \nat all. Not once. \u2026It just seemed like words, like a role-play thing. (Katy, \n20) \nLike the danger of slipping from belonging to conformity, the quest for authenticity \nmay slide towards artificiality. While Arnould and Price regard authenticating acts \nand authoritative performances as necessarily separate moments (2000: 159), Katy\u2019s \naccount highlights the possibility (albeit through failure) of the convergence of such \nmodes of self-making, particularly in the context of shared consumption rituals such \nas university balls. The dresses and suits\u2014carefully chosen to reflect an ideal self that \nis more attractive, confident, and mature\u2014mediate both a sense of individuality, and \nan experience of community.  \nThe interviews raised the complicated relationship between consumption and self-\nproduction. The consumer market is the wellspring of resources for constructing \nappearances and expressing identities. At the same time, the consumer market also \nposes obstacles and constraints; authenticity is always a fleeting, tactical victory (de \n 10 \n \nCerteau, 1984), as marketing and fashion co-opt the unusual and sell it as ready-to-\nwear \u2018cool\u2019 (Frank, 1997; Miles, 2000). Consumption also has its limits, especially as \none of the desired outcomes of self-work is defined, at least by our respondents, as \nresiding outside the realm of commodities: a sense of confidence and ease with \noneself. Moreover, this desired middle class habitus suggests the resilience of class in \nan age of individualization, even if (and more properly, because) it is invisible. \n\u2018People do not have to explicitly recognize class issues, or identify with discrete class \ngroupings, for class processes to operate\u2019 (Bottero, 2004: 989). As with ethnicity, if \nmembership in the dominant group disguises class and shields it from reflexive \nnegotiation, then the process of individualization may actually help to perpetuate \ntraditional categories, while individualizing them. Individuals, charged with the \nresponsibility of self-production, are expected to achieve the hallmarks of the \ndominant group; failure to do so is taken as evidence not of systemic inequality but \ninsufficient or inappropriate work on the self. \n \nThe negotiation of gender \nThe final theme emerging from the interviews concerns gender norms. Unlike \nethnicity and class, gender was a conspicuous element in respondents\u2019 discussions of \nappearances. Unsurprisingly, female respondents\u2019 comments indicate the conservative \nnature of the consumer body discourse:  \nI used to be really unhappy with my breasts, \u2018cause they\u2019re titchy tiny.  \nGirls are supposed to have big boobs! So it used to be that every time I \nwent to the beach and stuff I\u2019d be embarrassed. (Claire, 24) \n \nI think I\u2019d just like a flatter stomach \u2018cause that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always been \ntold and shown to be beautiful. Women are just expected to be slim and \ntoned. (Lisa, 21) \n \nI\u2019ve been told I\u2019ve got quite big boobs for my body size, so I\u2019m proud of \nthat! And that\u2019s what men always judge, isn\u2019t it?! (Rachel, 19) \nHowever, such remarks also bear evidence of reflexivity: an awareness that feelings \ntowards the body\u2014the parts to value, or feel ashamed of\u2014are shaped by socially \nconstructed gender norms. If the respondents\u2019 material practices are relatively \nhegemonic, at least their discursive strategies hold the potential for a negotiated, if not \noppositional, position (Hall, 1980). \nAll of the respondents commented on how attention to grooming and appearance \nwas increasingly commonplace\u2014indeed, socially expected\u2014for men in their \ngeneration. Hair styling, in particular, was noted by all in accounts of daily grooming \nroutines, with males participating as much or more than their female counterparts in \nstyling, buying styling products, and using the services of hair stylists. Similarly, the \nquestion of defining personal style drew mentions of clothing and fashion from both \nmale and female respondents, confirming O\u2019Connor\u2019s (2006) finding that Irish youth \nmade reference to clothes in their self-narratives, irrespective of gender. \nIf both young men and women are self-conscious about appearance management, \nhowever, it does not follow that appearance management is gender neutral. \nTraditional gender norms have associated attention to appearances and consumption \nwith femininity. Despite recent work that demonstrates increased emphasis on \nappearances and consumption in contemporary practices of masculinity (e.g. Edwards \n1997; Luciano 2001; Nixon 1996), men continue to occupy a peripheral position \n(relative to their female counterparts) in the field of consumer identity work. This is \n 11 \n \nreflected in both the male and female respondents\u2019 accounts of young men\u2019s \nappearance work, in which such practices are described as expected but also \nproblematic, requiring qualification and rationalization. For example, Matt describes a \nfriend as a \u2018big woman\u2019 because of his attention to appearances: \nI\u2019ve got a mate from footie [football]\u2026and we all take the piss \u2018cause he \nbleaches his hair and gets it cut all the time. And, he\u2019s a big woman in the \nfact that he never goes out unless he looks good, and he wears really \ntrendy clothes and always smells good and stuff. And although we all take \nthe piss, he\u2019s a really good looking guy and he gets more attention than we \nall do, and he always ends up with the fit girls, so it just shows that it does \nwork. So, although I\u2019d never admit it to him, I think I\u2019d like to spend more \ntime on looking after myself and looking good. (Matt, 22) \nSimilarly, Jess describes her group of male friends as all liking to look good and \ngroom themselves: \u2018They\u2019re like a bunch of women!\u2019 Too much attention to hair, \nclothes and so forth, and young men are accused (by male and female peers) of \n\u2018behaving like girls.\u2019   \nHowever, opting out of the grooming regime is not an option. Young men are \nexpected to look good; failure to do so translates into failure to compete well in the \nsocial and\u2014especially in a service economy\u2014occupational market. But they are also \nexpected to be \u2018men.\u2019 Comments from two of the female respondents highlight this \nconundrum:  \nI think it\u2019s good when boys spend a lot of time on their hair, that\u2019s good. I \nthink it\u2019d be weird to have a boyfriend who cleansed and moisturised, but \nthen I\u2019ve given my boyfriend moisturiser when his skin\u2019s not very good. \n(Lisa, 21) \n \nI wouldn\u2019t want to go out with a boy who was as concerned about himself \nas me, or spent longer in the bathroom than I did. I think being masculine \nmeans you\u2019re not supposed to be as concerned about grooming, but if \nyou\u2019re really hairy and like don\u2019t like it then fair enough, but I think its \nmore attractive when boys mainly stay the way they are. \u2026And I\u2019m very \nconcerned about hair! \u2026They need to have good hair. My favourite is a bit \nscruffy and rock boyish. (Claire, 24) \nLisa and Claire both express concerns about the limits of acceptable male behaviour, \nhighlighting the challenges posed to the category of femininity when a perceived \nmonopoly on appearance management is eroded. Lisa\u2019s comment brings to light the \nexceptionalism of identity narratives\u2014while she may have doubts about males, in \ngeneral, worrying about cleansing and moisturizing, she wants her boyfriend to do so. \nClaire\u2019s comment, meanwhile, brings to light the contradictions of gender norms\u2014\nwhile she is suspicious of males who are as concerned with appearances as females \n(and, again, this says much about the interdependence of gender norms), she wants to \ndate boys with appropriately styled hair: a classic gender double bind! \nSelf-production is mediated by gender norms. In the case of young men, balancing \ndistinction and belonging in the construction of appearance requires attention to the \nline between acceptable and unacceptable gender behaviour. As such, young men \nmust find ways of negotiating traditional expectations while taking up new consuming \nhabits. Two discursive strategies are suggested in the interviews. The first is an \ninsistence on the instrumentality of attention to appearance. That is, working on one\u2019s \nappearance is not about narcissism or pleasure, but about improving one\u2019s odds of \nsuccess in the social market. As Baudrillard (1998: 132) suggests, \u2018beauty is such an \n 12 \n \nabsolute imperative only because it is a form of capital.\u2019 The second is a flexible \ndefinition of limits that reinscribes the traditional view of gender as a mutually \nexclusive dichotomy. That is, young men\u2019s appearance management routines are \nacceptable insofar as they do not include certain unacceptable female practices. For \nexample, Ryan draws the line at plucking his eyebrows or getting a fake tan. \nSimilarly, Matt admits to moisturising and trimming his nails, but says, \u2018Girls are still \ndefinitely worse. Like I say, I don\u2019t know any bloke that fake tans or anything.\u2019 \nGender remains a collectively-defined category, even if it is treated increasingly as a \nvector for individual negotiation, performance and difference.   \n \nConclusion \n \nSelf-production is the mundane work of everyday life\u2014not the rarefied stuff of \ncontemplative self-reflection so much as the ordinary work of trying to look good, fit \nin, stand out. It is its very mundaneness that gives self-production its taken-for-\ngranted quality, and helps to reconcile the internal contradictions of the dynamic of \nidentity at the level of everyday practices and narratives. In their descriptions of their \nclothing choices and grooming habits, respondents spoke to the ongoing negotiation \nof the tension between individuality and belonging, and the difficulty of pursuing the \ngoals of authenticity and acceptance while contending with the risks of conformity \nand exclusion. At the same time, the ordinariness of self-production obscures some \nelements of identity\u2014such as ethnicity and class\u2014that might, in other contexts, be \nvisible and explicit; this lack of reflexive awareness potentially reproduces some of \nthe very norms and categories that are assumed to be weakened and negotiable in an \nage of individualization. \nConsumer culture makes available a range of techniques of self-production, but \nalso poses obstacles and challenges to narratives of authenticity and individuality. \nDealing with such risks involves the use of particular discursive strategies\u2014tools for \naccomplishing the technical problem of self-production while addressing its \nproblematic features. Several examples came to light in the course of the interviews, \nfrom means of reducing risk (by striving to meet social ideals) to means of \ntransferring risk onto others. Exculpatory discursive strategies shift the responsibility \n(and blame) for the risks of self-production onto others\u2014an understandable coping \nstrategy in an era of individualization in which people may increasingly bear the \nburden of responsibility for their choices, but have diminishing control over the \nmaterial factors shaping their chances of success (Bauman, 2000).   \nExculpatory narratives often overlap\u2014particularly around the issue of \nconsumption\u2014with narratives of individual exceptionalism, which acknowledge the \npower of fashion while claiming personal taste as an expression of sovereign \npreference. The \u2018proof\u2019 that one is an exception to crowd rule often lies in the \ncombinatorial logic of style\u2014even if all of the constitutive elements are mass \nproduced, one regards the overall outcome as an individual accomplishment, thereby \nsidestepping the deeply social nature of taste and style (Bourdieu, 1984). Furthermore, \nproof of individual exceptionalism resides in one\u2019s attitude, because confidence is \nseen to trump consumer goods in displaying identity (so much so that a confident \nattitude can overwrite the social consensus on whether an item is \u2018cool\u2019 or not). Here, \nwe see a naturalization of the desirability of the body habitus of the dominant class \n(Bourdieu, 1984)\u2014manifesting as confidence, ease with one\u2019s self, and less anxiety \nabout one\u2019s body-for-others. Contrary to the dominant advertising rhetoric of freedom \n 13 \n \nof choice, this suggests that class norms remain a powerful force constraining the \nrange of available, acceptable choices.   \nNarrative coping strategies rely heavily on\u2014and reproduce\u2014normative social \nvalues, including traditional gender norms (despite the seemingly new male \ninvestment in appearance). At the centre of such narratives is the normative myth of \nthe authentic, sovereign individual. A commitment to such an ideal\u2014one who is \nuncorrupted by social pressures and thus free to be who one really is\u2014provides a \nflexible defence mechanism against charges of conformity and artificiality. While \nsocial scientists may debunk such an ideal as illusory, it remains a deeply-entrenched \naspect of people\u2019s self-conception. Furthermore, the ideal of sovereignty is \nperpetuated by the social system more broadly, as it undergirds the neo-liberal \nreliance on individual choice and responsibility; rather than taking the system to task, \nindividuals are encouraged to locate success and blame within themselves.  \nIn our modern era of individualization, there is no more central problem than that \nof self-production. Style, a process of negotiating double binds, paradoxes, and \ntensions, is a constituent practice of self-production. If we take consumption as the \nstylistic field par excellence, then we see that consumption and self-production share \nthe same internal logic: to negotiate, if not reconcile, the \u2018struggle between \nindividuality and generality\u2019 (Simmel 1991: 63).  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the anonymous reviewers and editors for their \nconstructive comments on an earlier draft of the article.
