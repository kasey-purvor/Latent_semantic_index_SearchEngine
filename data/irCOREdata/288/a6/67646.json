Emery\nHigh Altitude Observatory, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado, USA\nReceived 31 July 2001; revised 17 December 2001; accepted 19 December 2001; published 20 July 2002.\n[1] Previous work by Chun et al. [1999] has shown that the polar cap (PC) index can be\nused as a proxy indicator of the integrated Joule heating rate in the Northern Hemisphere.\nHowever, knowledge of the spatial distribution of Joule heating is also important. The PC\nindex is a single magnetometer station-derived index which measures the level of\ngeomagnetic activity in the polar cap. A negative PC index corresponds to a condition\nrelated to lobe-merging convection conditions in the polar cap, near-zero PC indicates a\nquiet polar cap, and a positive PC indicates geomagnetically active periods. In this study\nwe developed average patterns of Joule heating as a function of PC using 56 days\n(\u000112,800 individual patterns) of Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics\ndata from various case studies. With PC ranging from \u00023 to 8, we divide the Joule heating\npatterns into PC bins of 1.0, finding that there is a clear spatial evolution of Joule heating\nfrom negative PC to positive PC. When PC is negative, Joule heating on average is\nconstrained to the high-latitude dayside. As PC goes to zero, Joule heating disappears.\nWhen PC increases in the positive direction, Joule heating intensifies throughout the\nauroral oval, with primary heating occurring along the dawn\/dusk flanks. Further analysis\nreveals that it is primarily changes in the electric potential and not the Pedersen\nconductance that accounts for Joule heating shifting from the auroral zone to the high-\nlatitude dayside when PC goes negative. We also find that the cross polar cap potential is\nlinearly proportional to the PC index, consistent with previous studies. Finally, we\ncompare the hemispheric energy budget between Joule heating and electron particle\nenergy. We find that globally, Joule heating is roughly 4 times that of particle energy\nduring geomagnetically active times (positive PC). During quiet times (zero PC), Joule\nheating and particle energy are equal contributors. When lobe-merging conditions occur\n(negative PC), Joule heating again dominates over particle energy except during the winter\nseason, when polar cap conductivity is driven more by particle precipitation.

Introduction\n[2] Joule heating is resistive heating due to current flow\nalong an electric field. The classic example of Joule heating\nis the heat one feels from an incandescent light bulb. Joule\nheating of Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere causes expansion of the\natmosphere and leads to a variety of dynamic and chemical\nchanges in the atmosphere and increased drag on low Earth-\norbiting satellites. Previous studies have focused on devel-\noping simple relationships between the total heating in the\nNorthern Hemisphere to various ionosphere properties or\ngeomagnetic indices [e.g., Chun et al., 1999; Ahn et al.,\n1983; Baumjohann and Kamide, 1984]. Although important\nto know the total Joule heating in the upper atmosphere, it is\ncritical to know where the heating is occurring. Joule\nheating patterns provide such insight.\n[3] Creating hemisphere Joule heating patterns can prove\nto be a daunting task because the patterns require detailed\nspatial knowledge of heating parameters. Only Foster et al.\n[1983] have published averaged Joule heating patterns as a\nfunction of geomagnetic activity. These patterns were based\non simultaneous observations of the electric field and\nPedersen conductivity calculated from individual measure-\nments of the ion drift velocity and particle precipitation\nobserved over the lifetime of the Atmospheric Explorer\n(AE-C) satellite from 1974 to 1978. The patterns were of a\nspatial resolution of 5\u0001 latitude by 2-hour local time and\nwere categorized by season (spring, summer, autumn, and\nwinter) and the Kp index (Kp = 0\u20133 and 3\u20136).\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 107, NO. A7, 10.1029\/2001JA000246, 2002\nCopyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/02\/2001JA000246$09.00\nSIA 9  - 1\n[4] We now have a unique opportunity to develop higher\nspatial and geomagnetic activity resolution patterns of Joule\nheating and associated ionosphere properties using data\nfrom the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrody-\nnamics (AMIE) technique. The AMIE technique is a\nweighted least-squares fit of ionospheric electrodynamic\nparameters to a variety of ground- and space-based data\nand statistical models [Richmond and Kamide, 1988]. The\nprocedure is typically run at a 5\u201310 min cadence, thus\nproducing time-varying maps of high-latitude features. The\na priori information contained in the statistical models is\nused to constrain the electrodynamic parameters over\nregions where data are absent or sparse.\n[5] The procedure first modifies statistical models of\nionospheric height-integrated conductance and auroral pre-\ncipitation with all available observations related to these\nparameters. The newly derived conductance distribution is\napplied to the inversion of ground magnetic perturbations to\nhelp produce the electric potential or convection distribution.\nWhen available, more direct information about the electric\nfield, such as ion drift observations from polar orbiting\nsatellites and radars, are assimilated with magnetic perturba-\ntions to create a global view of the high-latitude electro-\ndynamics. The weighting factors for the observations are\ngiven by the inverse covariance matrix of the errors, includ-\ning observational errors, errors associated with AMIE\u2019s\ninherent spatial smoothing, and errors associated with inac-\ncuracies in the simplifying assumptions that are used within\nthe procedure. The errors are presumed to be uncorrelated.\n[6] In the past, AMIE has been used extensively for\ngeomagnetic storm case studies, some which have focused\non electric field and conductance distributions. These stud-\nies have provided a wealth of data that can be used to\nproduce patterns of many ionosphere properties. For this\nstudy we extract two additional AMIE output fields that are\ndirectly relevant to estimating the energy dissipation in the\nionosphere, precipitating electron energy flux and Joule\nheating. AMIE calculates Joule heating as \u0001pE\n2, where\n\u0001p is the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity in the\nionosphere and E is the electric field.\n[7] In this paper we present results of our study, which\nnot only shows expected hemisphere patterns during most\ngeomagnetic conditions but also averaged heating patterns\nduring periods of lobe merging. We use the polar cap (PC)\nindex as a measure of geomagnetic activity as opposed to\nmore established indices such as AE. Vennerstr\u00f8m et al.\n[1991] discussed reasons why one would sometimes want to\nuse PC over AE. In this study we use PC because this work\nis an extension of our previous work and because PC is\navailable in near real time. Thus we extend our previous\nstudy [Chun et al., 1999], which showed that the polar cap\nindex can be used as a proxy measurement of the hemi-\nspheric, integrated Joule heating rate into the domain of\nspatial variations. We first discuss our data and then present\nlocal time and latitude maps of Joule heating as a function\nof the polar cap index. Finally, we compare our results to\nprevious studies and discuss our limitations.\n2. Data\n[8] The polar cap index is derived from a single magneto-\nmeter located in the polar cap region [Troshichev et al.,\n1988] and is a measure of geomagnetic activity level in\nthe polar cap. The north PC index is derived from a\nmagnetometer station at Thule, while the south PC index\nis derived from the Vostok station. PC is well correlated\nto Joule heating [Chun et al., 1999] and to the AE index\n[Vennerstr\u00f8m et al., 1991] and is reported at a 15-min\ntime resolution. In our study we use the PC index\nvalues calculated from the Qaanaq (Thule) ground mag-\nnetometer operated by the Danish Meteorological Insti-\ntute (DMI). DMI processes the PC index using 12\n(months) by 24 (hours) coefficients and a winter-time\nquiet level curve removal method. Some evidence exists\nthat a 5-min coefficient set and a different quiet level\ncurve removal would produce larger PC values (O.\nTroshichev, personal communication, 2001). We believe\nthat our binning of PC is minimally affected by the\nchoice of PC processing methods. Figure 1 shows the\ncumulative sum distribution of PC in our database. Most\nof the time the PC index indicates low to moderate\nactivity (PC = 0\u20135) and only rarely (<10% of patterns)\nrecords extreme storm (>5) or lobe-merging convection\n(<0) activity.\n[9] Table 1 summarizes the AMIE case studies that we\nhave used in this study. These studies include magnetometer\ndata from at least 60 stations worldwide with between 3 and\n5 stations in the polar cap. Many of these studies also use\ndata from various satellites such as TIROS, DMSP, Ake-\nbono (EXOS D), and UARS. Typical satellite data included\nin AMIE studies are electron precipitation data and ion drift\nmeasurements. Finally, most of these studies use data from\ncoherent and incoherent radar (e.g., ion drift velocities), and\na few used data from polar cap digisondes. Details of the\ncase studies and their data input are given by the associated\nreferences.\n[10] The campaigns tended to focus on geomagnetically\nactive periods. Can they be considered representative of the\nbroader realm of solar-terrestrial interactions? In Table 1 we\nhave used data from a solar flow characterization study\n[Richardson et al., 2000; I. Richardson, personal commu-\nnication, 2001] to show the number of hours in each\ncampaign interval associated with three solar flow types:\nFigure 1. Cumulative distribution of the polar cap (PC)\nindex in our database.\nSIA 9  - 2 CHUN ET AL.: JOULE HEATING PATTERNS\nejecta, high-speed stream, and slow flow. In our database,\n35.3% of the campaign hours were dominated by ejecta,\n38.4% by high-speed flow, and 26.3% by slow flow. Solar\ncycle averages for these flow types are 30% ejecta, 45%\nhigh-speed flow, and 25% slow flow. While the AMIE\nintervals proportionately represent slow flow, ejecta are\nslightly over-represented, and high-speed streams are some-\nwhat underrepresented. Despite this the distribution of PC\nindex associated with our database is very similar to the\noverall PC distribution for 1975\u20131997 (see discussion\nbelow). We believe that this arises because many of our\nejecta events are magnetic clouds with significant intervals\nof a northward interplanetary magnetic field that produces\ngeomagnetic quiet conditions even though Earth is immersed\nin ejecta flow. Although the case studies were usually solar\nand geomagnetic events, we feel that they provide a good\nrepresentative sampling of ionospheric conditions.\n[11] Chun et al. [1999, Figure 1] showed the cumulative\ndistribution of the PC index for three situations: an active year\n(1982) based on the sunspot number, a quiet year (1997), and\nthe average of all the PC data available at the time (1975\u2013\n1997). What that figure showed was that, on average, PC > 5\noccurred \u00012\u20133% of the time, and PC < 0 occurred \u00017\u20138%\nof the time. It also showed a median (0.5 or 50%) PC value of\njust under 1. The distribution of the PC index in our database\nis very similar as seen in Figure 1 and in Table 2. Table 2 is a\nbreakout of the percentage of AMIE patterns in our database\nper PC bin. It is clear from Table 2 that most of the AMIE\npatterns correspond to low to moderate PC values (0 \u0003 PC <\n5). Looking at the \u2018\u2018percent of total\u2019\u2019 numbers for the negative\nand large positive PC (PC < 0 and PC > 5, respectively)\nacross all three seasons, one sees that 9.4% of the patterns fall\ninto those extreme PC ranges. Finally, the median PC value in\nour database is also just under 1.\n[12] Since the case studies were at various time and spatial\nresolutions, we merged the data for our study into 2\u0001\nmagnetic colatitude by 1-hour magnetic local time (MLT)\nbins. We did, however, maintain the time resolution of the\nAMIE data and interpolated the Northern Hemisphere PC\ndata from Thule from 15 min to the appropriate AMIE time\nresolution (either 5 or 10 min). Our database consists of 56\ndays and\u000112,800 individual patterns. Using bin sizes of 1 in\nPC (from \u00023 to 8), we took the average of the individual\npatterns for each bin. We also divided our patterns into a\nsummer, winter, and equinox season defined by a window of\n\u000190 days centered on the appropriate solstice and equinox.\n3. Joule Heating Patterns\n[13] Figures 2, 3, and 4 are the Joule heating patterns for\nsummer, equinox, and winter, respectively. These patterns\nrepresent the average of all patterns which fall into each PC\nbin. The patterns are arranged from the most negative PC\nbin for the season (top left) to the most positive PC bin\n(bottom right) in a left-to-right fashion. Magnetic noon local\ntime is at the top, and midnight local time is at the bottom\nfor each individual pattern. The latitude scale is from 40\u0001 to\n90\u0001. The number of individual AMIE patterns included in\nthe averaged pattern is indicated by the number in paren-\ntheses, and the total integrated hemisphere Joule heating is\ncalculated and presented with each average pattern (for\nexample, for the pattern corresponding to PC index between\n0 and 1 in the summer, there are 1716 individual patterns\nthat went into the averaged pattern, and its integrated Joule\nheating rate is 24 GW). The colorscale of the Joule heating\ncontours range from 0.001 to 0.08 W\/m2 with a contour\ninterval of 0.002 W\/m2.\n[14] Figure 2 shows a progression of average Joule heat-\ning patterns (read left to right, top to bottom) in the Northern\nHemisphere during the summer season for negative PC\n(lobe-merging convection conditions), zero to low positive\nPC (quiet geomagnetic conditions), and large positive PC\n(active geomagnetic conditions). PC ranges from \u00023 to 6.\nThere is a clear evolution of the Joule heating spatial\ndistribution from the high-latitude dayside (dayside defined\nas sunward of the dawn-dusk meridian) to an auroral oval\nshape as the polar cap activity changes from a lobe-merging\nTable 2.

In\naddition, the total integrated Joule heating rate also increases\nin both directions away from the quiet condition (PC = 0).\nDuring negative PC periods the total integrated heating rate\nincreases from \u000117 to 38 GW and is constrained to a very\nlocalized region in the high-latitude dayside. As PC\nincreases, the total heating rate increases to \u0001450 GW and\nbecomes more intense along the dawn and dusk flanks, with\nthe predominate heating occuring on the dawn side.\n[15] Figure 3 shows the average Joule heating patterns for\nequinox (which includes both spring and autumn). For the\nequinox patterns, PC ranges from \u00022 to 8 (again, read from\nleft to right, top to bottom). A comparison with Figure 2\nshows no substantial difference between summer and equinox\npatterns. As with the summer patterns, the equinox Joule\nheating patterns exhibit localized heating in the high-latitude\ndayside during negative PC intervals, minimal Joule heating\nfor near-zero PC conditions, and increased intensity and\nspatial extent along the auroral oval for larger positive PC\nvalues. The total integrated heating varies from16 to 317GW.\n[16] Figure 4 is the average Joule heating patterns for\nwinter with PC ranging from \u00022 to 8. Compared with\nsummer and equinox, there are fewer cases when PC is\nstrongly negative, but even during slightly negative PC\nvalues (\u00021 \u0003 PC < 0), Joule heating, on average, occurs\nat high latitudes on the dayside. However, for the most\nnegative PC bin (\u00022 \u0003 PC < \u00021), there is, on average, no\nstrong region of heating except for a narrow latitudinal\nregion along the dusk meridian. As PC increases, however,\nJoule heating is again constrained to the auroral oval with\nintense heating occuring more along the dawn flank than the\ndusk flank. The total integrated Joule heating ranges from 4\nto over 450 GW.\n[17] In the presentation of these average patterns a ques-\ntion arises as to whether the average results are statistically\nsignificant. Another question is whether the PC index orders\nthe Joule heating data well. We attempt to assess the\nstatistical significance of the Joule heating data by analyzing\nhow the average Joule heating rate (mW\/m2) varies as a\nfunction of PC for four different latitude local time sectors.\nThe four sectors were located at midnight (78\u0001\u201384\u0001magnetic\nlatitude (MLAT), 22\u201302 MLT), noon (78\u0001\u201384\u0001 MLAT, 10\u2013\n14 MLT), dawn (60\u0001\u201366\u0001 MLAT, 04\u201308 MLT), and dusk\n(60\u0001\u201366\u0001 MLAT, 16\u201320 MLT). These four latitude local\ntime sectors were chosen to represent the high-latitude polar\nregions along the noon-midnight meridian and the auroral\nregion along the flanks of the ionosphere, respectively.\n[18] Figure 5 shows the average Joule heating rate as a\nfunction of PC for these four sectors. The midnight sector is\nthe top panel, noon is the second panel, dawn is the third\npanel, and dusk is the bottom panel. The data are further\nseparated into summer (left column; Figure 5a), equinox\n(middle column; Figure 5b), and winter (right column;\nFigure 5c) seasons. Note the different y axis scales for the\nmidnight and noon plots (\u00025 to 20 mW\/m2) compared to\nthe dawn and dusk plots (\u000210 to 40 mW\/m2). All of the\nplots have the same x axis scale (\u00023 \u0003 PC < 9). All four\nlatitude local time sectors in each season show that the\nFigure 3. Average Joule heating patterns as a function of\nPC index (equinox). See color version of this figure at back\nof this issue.\nFigure 2. Average Joule heating patterns as a function of\npolar cap index (summer). See color version of this figure at\nback of this issue.\nSIA 9  - 4 CHUN ET AL.: JOULE HEATING PATTERNS\naverage Joule heating is minimal around a PC of zero since\nthe activity is low. However, as activity increases in the\npositive PC direction, the average Joule heating also\nincreases in all four latitude local time sectors and in all\nseasons. As one would expect, the dawn and dusk flanks\nexhibit the highest heating compared to the high-latitude\nmidnight and noon sectors. However, the noon plots show\nthat significant heating can occur at higher latitudes as PC\nbecomes negative (indicative of northward IMF conditions).\nAlso of note is the asymmetry in the dawn and dusk heating\nrates. The average dawn heating rate can at times be about\ntwice that of the dusk heating rate. Thus Figure 5 suggests\nthat our results are statistically significant in that each sector\nresponds differently with PC, each latitude local time\nsector\u2019s relationship with PC varies across seasons, and that\nPC orders the Joule heating data well.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Heating Associated With Lobe-Merging\nConvection\n[19] Analysis of the averaged Joule heating patterns\nduring lobe-merging convection periods (negative PC)\nshows that much of the heating is constrained to very high\nlatitudes and to the dayside, as opposed to occurring along\nthe auroral oval and flanks. This result indicates that the\nclassic two-cell convection pattern evolves into a smaller\nspatial region with no discernable auroral oval as the\nconditions in the polar cap evolve into a lobe-merging\nconvection situation.\n[20] To investigate this further, we present representative\naveraged patterns of the electric potential and Pedersen\nconductance for three PC bins. Figure 6 shows a series of\naveraged Pedersen conductance (top row) and electric\npotential (middle row) patterns associated with the Joule\nheating patterns for the summer season and the three\nnegative PC bins from \u00023 to 0 (i.e., the top row of Joule\nheating patterns from Figure 2). Note that the bottom row of\nFigure 6 also shows corresponding average patterns of\nelectron particle fluxes, which will be discussed in section\n4.2. The format of the plots are similar to the Joule heating\npattern plots, except that for the electric potential plots the\ncross polar cap potential is reported. The three patterns in\nthe \u00023 \u0003 PC < \u00022 plot are from the 26\u201329 May 1996\nevent; the 28 patterns in the \u00022 \u0003 PC < \u00021 plot are from\nthe 2\u20133 August 1991 (5 patterns), 26\u201329 May 1996 (21\npatterns), and 27 May 1993 (2 patterns) events; and the 434\nFigure 5. Average Joule heating rate (mW\/m2) for mid-\nnight, noon, dawn, and dusk segments as a function of PC.\n(a) Summer data is shown in the left column, (b) equinox is\nshown in the middle column, and (c) winter is shown in the\nright column. The standard deviation of the average are also\nplotted as the error bars, but the reader is cautioned that\nnegative Joule heating is unphysical.\nFigure 4. Average Joule heating patterns as a function of\nPC index (winter). See color version of this figure at back of\nthis issue.\nCHUN ET AL.: JOULE HEATING PATTERNS SIA 9  - 5\npatterns in the \u00021 \u0003 PC < 0 plot are from the 2\u20133 August\n1991 (10 patterns), 20\u201321 July 1992 (62 patterns), 27 May\n1993 (50 patterns), 26\u201329 May 1996 (176 patterns), and\n14\u201318 May 1997 (136 patterns) events.\n[21] The averaged Pedersen conductance patterns (Figure\n6, top row) do not show any dramatic evolution from a PC\nof \u00023 to a PC of 0 (especially in the high-latitude dayside).\nIn addition, although there is significant distortion of the\nsolar-induced conductivity, there is no noticeable enhance-\nment of conductivity at high latitudes on the dayside. The\nprimary factor constraining Joule heating to the high-lat-\nitude dayside appears to be the electric fields, as seen in the\nelectric potential patterns. Granted, the averaged electric\npotential, and thus Joule heating patterns, for the first two\nPC bins are dominated by the 26\u201329 May 1996 event. Thus\none would expect very little change in the average patterns.\nHowever, the third plot (\u00021 \u0003 PC < 0) is not as heavily\ndominated by the 26\u201329 May 1996 event, and we can\nobserve that although the averaged electric potential pattern\nis different from the previous PC bins, the result is the same:\nThe average Joule heating is still confined to the high-\nlatitude region.\n[22] Previous work by Foster et al. [1983] showed high-\nlatitude dayside heating (note that their data were limited to\nlatitudes <80\u0001) usually comparable to or greater than that\nalong the auroral oval. Their averaged patterns exhibited\nglobal heating occuring throughout all seasons and geo-\nmagnetic activity (Kp = 0\u20133 and 3\u20136), whereas our patterns\nshow a clear evolution with the PC index from polar cap or\nhigh-latitude dayside heating to intense heating in the dusk\/\ndawn flanks of the oval. This difference in our patterns is\nprobably due to differences in our geomagnetic binning\nscheme and parameter since the Kp index is not as well\nsuited as the PC index in distinguishing lobe-merging\nconvection conditions. Foster et al. [1983] also showed\nheating rates between 0 and 8 mW\/m2 with total integrated\nheating rates upward to 160 GW, lower than our estimates\nby up to a factor of 4. We find that our integrated hemi-\nspheric Joule heating rate is more comparable to those\nfound by Ahn et al. [1983] and Baumjohann and Kamide\n[1984].\n4.2. Comparison Studies\n[23] We make a simple comparison of integrated Joule\nheating rates for each season and averaged pattern to the\nquadratic fits from our earlier study [Chun et al., 1999] in\nFigure 7. The average integrated heating rate and standard\ndeviation (indicated by the error bars) of each PC bin are\nplotted as the data points, and a quadratic fit is plotted as the\nsolid line. Since the fit relationships intercept the majority\nof the error bars, one could make the argument that the\nquadratic fits appear to adequately represent this study\u2019s\nresults. This is expected though since the fits were based on\na subset of the database used in this study. This study\nincludes data from two severe storm events (Kp > 8) that\nwere excluded from our earlier study due to less than ideal\nsatellite data coverage.\n[24] Using data from the low-energy charged particle\ndetector and the electric field detector on the EXOS D\n(Akebono) satellite, Troshichev et al. [1996] correlated the\ncross polar cap potential to the PC index. Using 80 EXOS D\ncrossings of the polar cap in March\u2013April 1990, they found\na correlation of 0.797 between the two parameters with a\nrelationship of \u0002(kV) = 19.35 PC + 8.78. We have average\nelectric potential patterns (e.g., middle row of Figure 6) for\neach Joule heating pattern as a function of PC, so we can\nalso correlate the average cross polar cap potential from the\nAMIE database to the PC index. Figure 8 shows our results\nfor each season, summer (top panel), equinox (middle\npanel), and winter (bottom panel). We show two correla-\ntions, one for positive PC and one for negative PC. In\naddition, we show the Troshichev et al. [1996] correlation as\na dashed line.\nFigure 7. Comparison of integrated Joule heating from\naverage patterns with quadratic fits (proxy Joule heating)\n[from Chun et al., 1999].\nFigure 6. Average Pedersen conductance and electric\npotential patterns associated with the averaged Joule heating\nsummer patterns (top row of plots in Figure 2) for negative\nPC (\u00022.5 \u0003 PC < \u00020.5). The average electron particle flux\npatterns corresponding to the same PC bins are plotted in\nthe bottom row. See color version of this figure at back of\nthis issue.\nSIA 9  - 6 CHUN ET AL.: JOULE HEATING PATTERNS\n[25] Average polar cap potential is positively correlated\nwhen the PC index is positive with correlation coefficients\nof 0.99 for all three seasons. During summer, when the PC\nindex is negative, the polar cap potential is negatively\ncorrelated with a correlation coefficient of \u00020.879. The\nslope of the weighted linear fits for all three seasons (17.1,\n12.3, and 12.9 for summer, equinox, and winter, respec-\ntively) is smaller than that reported by Troshichev et al.\n[1996]. This discrepancy can be accounted for if, for\nnegative PC indices, we convert the polar cap potential into\na negative value and include all data into one linear fit\n(similar to Troshichev et al. [1996]). When we do this, we\nget slopes of 21, 19.1, and 17 for summer, equinox, and\nwinter, respectively, consistent with Troshichev et al.\n[1996]. The fit coefficients for Figure 8 and their corre-\nsponding uncertainties are summarized in Table 3.\n[26] Finally, we make a comparison of the average Joule\nheating with the average energy from electron particle flux.\nWe have created average patterns of electron particle flux\ncorresponding to each PC bin in Figures 2, 3, and 4. Three\nexamples of these patterns can be seen in the bottom row of\nFigure 6, which corresponds to the negative PC bins in\nsummer (top row of Figure 2). Figure 9 is a plot of hemi-\nspheric integrated electron particle flux versus PC for\nsummer (top panel), equinox (middle panel), and winter\n(bottom panel). Corresponding integrated Joule heating rates\nare plotted in Figure 7 for a comparison. To first order, one\ncan see that Joule heating rates are typically greater than\nparticle flux energy. Electron particle fluxes are linearly\ncorrelated with PC with correlation coefficients of 0.94\n(summer), 0.92 (equinox), and 0.98 (winter). The weighted\nlinear fit equations are shown in each plot panel and\nsummarized in Table 4. It appears that during quiet periods,\nwith PC close to zero, Joule heating and particle energy are\ncomparable in magnitude. In summer and equinox, as the PC\nindex decreases below zero, Joule heating increases, whereas\nparticle energy appears relatively constant. In winter, how-\never, Joule heating and particle energy appear to match one\nanother, which is perhaps a result that during the winter\nseason, polar cap conductivity, and thus Joule heating, is\nmore dependent on electron particle precipitation during\ntimes of negative PC conditions.\n[27] Figure 10 is a plot of the ratio of Joule heating to\nelectron particle energy for the three seasons. Summer is\nindicated by a square, equinox is a triangle, and winter is a\ncircle. From this plot we see that although the spatial\ndistributions of Joule heating and particle energy are very\ndifferent; they provide, on average, equal contributions to\nthe global energy budget during geomagnetically quiet\ntimes (near zero PC). As PC increases in both directions\nfrom zero, Joule heating becomes a larger contributor with\nratios approaching 4 to 5, consistent with previous studies\n[Ahn et al., 1983; Lu et al., 1995]. The exception again is\nnegative PCs during winter, where the ratio of Joule heating\nto particle energy remains close to 1 and is sometimes <1.\nThe heating ratios also exhibit seasonal variations, with the\nlargest ratio occurring in the summer followed by equinox\nand then winter. In addition, although Ahn et al. [1983] and\nVickrey et al. [1982] showed that the Joule heating to\nparticle energy ratio was independent of the AL and Kp\nindices, respectively, it is clear from our data that the ratios\nare dependent on the PC index.\nTable 3.

Limitations\n[28] We must note some limitations in our data and\nanalysis, in that it is difficult to quantify the effects of\nneutral winds, electric field variability, and induced currents\nin the AMIE procedure. Neutral wind effects are known to\nsometimes enhance the local Joule heating rate upward from\n200\u2013400% associated with significant changes in the elec-\ntric field direction, as well as sometimes reducing the local\nheating rate by 40% during periods when the electric field is\nenhanced but in a steady direction [Thayer, 1998]. In one\nstudy of a Geospace Environment Modeling campaign\nperiod, 28\u201329 March 1992, Lu et al. [1995] showed that\nneutral winds had a 28% reduction on Joule heating.\nAccurately accounting for neutral winds in our AMIE\ndatabase would be difficult to accomplish without incorpo-\nrating AMIE results into a thermosphere-ionosphere general\ncirculation model, similar to the approach taken by Lu et al.\n[1995]. Since AMIE relies heavily on magnetometer data,\nthe AMIE procedure does capture some neutral wind\neffects since the magnetometers measure magnetic fields\nfrom all sources. Separating out the neutral wind effect\nfrom other magnetic field sources, however, would be a\nmajor undertaking and would be beyond the scope of this\npaper.\n[29] Not accounting for the variability in the electric field\ncan also lead to underestimating Joule heating. Using\ntheoretical arguments, Codrescu et al. [1995] showed that\nby including electric field variability, Joule heating esti-\nmates could increase by 33\u2013234% depending on whether\nthe variability was of magnetospheric origin or due to local\nconductivity changes. Further, Codrescu et al. [2000]\nshowed that inclusion of electric field variance (as a\nGaussian about a zero mean) into the Millstone Hill electric\nfield model yielded integrated hemispheric Joule heating\nrates about twice what one would get by just using the\naverage electric field in the Joule heating calculations.\nRecently, using European Incoherent Scatter radar data,\nRodger et al. [2001] compared 6-min electric field data to\nhourly averaged electric field data, and found that the\nmedian underestimation of Joule heating by using hourly\naveraged electric field data was \u000120% with an upper\nextreme of 40%. They also determined that this under-\nestimation was independent of geomagnetic conditions,\nsolar flux, and magnetic local time. Finally, Crowley and\nHackert [2001] have reported results of temporal variations\nin AMIE\u2019s electric field for a single day. They found that the\nstandard deviation of their patterns was comparable with the\nmean value of the high-latitude electric field. We have\ndetermined (not shown) that the standard deviations in our\nJoule heating patterns are, at times, on the same order of\nmagnitude as the average Joule heating. However, they are\nusually lower. Future work will investigate the spatial\nvariability of the electric field in our database.\n[30] Another possible limitation of this study could be\ndue to inaccurately accounting for magnetic field contribu-\ntions from internal sources like induced currents in Earth. A\nrecent study by Tanskanen et al. [2001] showed that\nmagnetic contributions from induced currents in Earth can\naccount for up to 40% of the measured magnetic field at a\ngiven station during substorm onset. Additionally, during\nsubstorm recovery, stations near oceans can receive between\n25 and 30% contribution from these internal currents, while\ninland stations receive between 15 and 20%. Thus AMIE\ncould be overestimating Joule heating.\n[31] In summary, we have noted that various uncertainties\ncould perhaps lead to underestimations of AMIE-derived\nJoule heating (neutral winds and electric field variability) or\noverestimations (induced currents). Comparisons between\nAMIE results and runs of the Thermosphere-Ionosphere\nElectrodynamics General Circulation Model, however, sug-\ngest that AMIE generally underestimates upper atmospheric\nheating by a factor of 2 [Emery et al., 1999].\n[32] The AMIE procedure does attempt to account for\nuncertainty (and possible associated variability) in the data.\nThe procedure accounts for some electric field variability\nsince AMIE uses an inverse covariance matrix of the\n\u2018\u2018errors\u2019\u2019 to develop weighting factors of its observational\ndata. For instance, AMIE uncertainty in the electric fields\nranges from 5 to 25 mV\/m that correspond to uncertainties\nin the Joule heating estimates on the order of a few mW\/m2\n[Richmond and Kamide, 1988].\n[33] In terms of accounting for internal current sources,\nthe AMIE procedure provides a rough estimate of the\nmagnetic field due to induced underground current sources\nby assuming a perfectly conducting layer at a depth of 250\nkm below Earth\u2019s surface overlain by a perfect insulator.\nThis leads to uncertainties in the magnetic field on the order\nof 10% [Richmond and Kamide, 1988].\n[34] Although it would be ideal to account for all of the\nerrors and uncertainties in these 15 AMIE case studies, the\ndata sets and current implementation of the algorithm do not\nlend themselves to a straightforward means of doing so.\nEfforts are underway, however, to improve future AMIE\nanalysis by improving and expanding the covariance matrix\nused in the procedure [Matsuo et al., 2002]. Despite the\nlimitations discussed here we believe the AMIE results, in\ngeneral, and our results, specifically, are consistent with\nprevious studies that determined average global character-\nistics of the ionosphere. Further, we anticipate this study\nFigure 10. Ratio of Joule heating to electron particle\nheating as a function of PC. Summer is indicated by a\nsquare, equinox by a triangle, and winter by a circle.\nSIA 9  - 8 CHUN ET AL.: JOULE HEATING PATTERNS\nwill provide a framework for future comparison of Joule\nheating derived from more direct measurements obtained\nfrom satellites and radars.\n5. Conclusions\n[35] In this study we have shown averaged estimated\npatterns of Joule heating from AMIE as a function of the\npolar cap (PC) index and season. We find that during times\nof negative PC, reminiscent of a reverse convection sit-\nuation in the polar cap, Joule heating is confined to a limited\nregion in the dayside high latitude. As geomagnetic activity\nincreases with increasing PC, heating intensifies and\nexpands along the auroral oval with the greatest heating\noccurring along the dawn and dusk flanks. Moderate to high\nvalues of PC are associated with hemispherically integrated\nJoule heating rates in excess of 450 GW. Joule heating is\ntypically \u00014\u20135 times greater than electron particle heating\nduring geomagnetically active times, but during quiet times\nthe heat inputs are comparable. Seasonal variations are also\nevident in the ratio of the two heat inputs.\n[36] Acknowledgments. The PC index was provided by the Danish\nMeteorological Institute. We thank A. Richmond, O.
