This work presents a cost-effective technology for the formation of nanostructured\nsemiconductor materials for tunable light emitting devices. CdS and ZnS semiconducting colloid\nnanoparticles coated with organic shell, containing either SO3- or NH3+ groups, were deposited as thin films\nusing the technique of electrostatic self-assembly.

INTRODUCTION\nIn the past decade, II-VI semiconductor nanoparticles have attracted much attention because of their size-dependent\n(and thus tunable) photo- and electro- luminescence properties and promising applications in optoelectronics.\nDifferent chemical (or wet) techniques for the preparation and deposition of II-VI semiconductor nanoparticles,\nsuch as LB film method [1,2], Electrochemical Deposition [3,4] and Electrostatic Self-assembly of colloid\nnanoparticles [5-10], have been exploited. The latter method is of particular interest, because it allows the\ndeposition of pre-synthesized colloid nanoparticles of different II-VI semiconducting materials. The main\nabsorption and luminescent bands of such materials can be easily controlled by their composition and particle size\nto enable the fabrication of LEDs of required colours [10] or white light LEDs covering the whole visible spectral\nrange [7].\nThe main purpose of this research is to provide convenient, economic, and environmental friendly alternatives to\nsome of the expensive physical methods of nano-structures formation. In this work, we use an aqueous-phase\nsynthesis of colloid nanoparticles', similar to the route described in [11]. A small modification of the synthesis\nallowed us to produce CdS and ZnS colloid nanoparticles coated with organic shell containing either SO3- or NH3+\ngroups and thus suitable for electrostatic self-assembly (ESA). This gives more possible deposition procedures by\nalternating the layers of cationic and anionic nanoparticles with the polycations and polyanions, respectively, as\nwell as a route to deposit nanoparticles even without intermediate binding polyelectrolyte layers. This approach\ncould be useful in the future for the formation of semiconductor superlattices.\nThis work focused on the optimization of the film deposition procedure and studying optical properties of thin films\ncontaining II-VI nanoparticles using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The\nmorphology of the obtained films was assessed using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM).\n2. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n1 Materials and Engineering Research Institute, Sheffield Hallam University, City Campus, Pond Street, Sheffield, S1\n1WB, UK\n2 Cranfield Health, Cranfield University, Silsoe, Bedfordshire, MK45 4DT, UK.\n2.1. Preparation of colloid nanoparticles\nCdS-SO3\uf02d and ZnS-SO3\uf02d colloid nanoparticles were prepared by mixing aqueous solutions of 0.04 M sodium 2-\nmercapto-ethane-sulfonate with 0.04 M solution of either CdCl2 or ZnCl2. A 0.04 M solution of sodium sulfide was\nthen added dropwise to the solution while it is stirred. Colloid nanoparticles of CdS-NH2+ and ZnS-NH2+ were made\nthe same way but using 0.04 M cysteamine hydrochloride as a capping agent.\nAll chemicals used were of high purity purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Solutions were prepared using Millipore\nwater having resistance of no less than 18 M\uf057.\n2.2. Electrostatic self-assembly\nThe films of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles coated with either negatively (SO3\uf02d) or positively (NH2+) charged shells\nwere deposited layer-by-layer onto electrically charged solid substrates using intermediate layers of either\npolyanions, such as poly-allylamine hydrochloride (PAH), or polycations, such as poly-styrene-sulfonate sodium\nsalt (PSS) [5,6]. The substrates (glass and quartz slides, and silicon wafers) were treated in 1% KOH solution in\n60% ethanol, to make them negatively charged [12].\nMultilayers of CdS-SO3\uf02d and ZnS-SO3\uf02d nanoparticles, were deposited by dipping the substrate consecutively into\n1M PAH solution and then into respective colloid solution for 10 minutes in each, as shown in Figure1(a).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1. Deposition of colloid nanoparticles CdS-SO3\uf02d (a) and CdS-NH2+ (b).\nMultilayers of CdS-NH2+ and ZnS-NH2+ nanoparticles, were prepared by dipping the substrate firstly into 1M\nsolution of PAA for 20 min followed by consecutive dipping in 1M PSS solution and in respective colloid solution\nfor 10 min in each, as shown in Figure 1(b). All samples were thoroughly rinsed in Millipore water after each\ndeposition step.\n2.3. Experimental methods\nUV-visible absorption spectra of the films deposited onto glass and quartz substrates were recorded using Varian\nCARY 50 spectrophotometer. In the case of ZnS particles which, have a main absorption band at a much shorter\nwavelength range, quartz substrates were used.\nOptical parameters of the films obtained were studied with spectroscopic ellipsometry. The measurements were\ncarried out on the films deposited on pieces of silicon wafers using the J.A. Woollam M2000V rotating analyser\nspectroscopic instrument, which operates in the spectral range of 370-1000 nm. The angle of incidence of 70O was\nused. The optical parameters, i.e. thickness (d) and complex refractive index ( jknN \uf02d\uf03d ), where n is the index of\nrefraction and k is the extinction coefficient were evaluated from the experimental spectra of two ellipsometric\nparameters \uf059 and \uf044 representing, respectively, the amplitude ratio and phase shift between p- and s- components of\npolarised light:\n\uf028 \uf029 SPSP AAarctn \uf06a\uf06a \uf02d\uf03d\uf044\uf03d\uf059 , (1)\nThe procedure of fitting of the experimental \uf059(\uf06c) and \uf044(\uf06c) spectra consist of solving the main ellipsometric\nequation\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\nS\nP\nR\nR\ni \uf03d\uf044\uf059 exptan , (2)\nin which Fresnel reflection coefficients, Rp and Rs for p- and s- components of polarized light, respectively, are\nrelated to the parameters of the reflecting system (d, n, and k ) through Fresnel equations [13]. Commercial\nVWASE32\uf0d2 software provided by J.A. Woollam Co [14] was used for data fitting.\nThe morphology of the films deposited on silicon substrates was studied with AFM using the Digital Instruments\nNanoscope IIIa equipment. Typical parameters for tapping mode measurements were: cantilever oscillation\nfrequency of 300-500 kHz, VEECO tapping mode cantilevers with the tip radius less than 10 nm, the scan rate of 1\nHz. Particle size analysis of the obtained images was performed using the Digital Instruments integrated\nimage processing software.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nTypical absorption spectra of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles embedded in organic films of PAH and PSS are shown in\nFigures 2 (a) and (b). The absorption intensity increases monotonically with the increase in the number of layers,\nwhich reflects the consistency of electrostatic deposition. It has to be noted that the role of polyelectrolyte layers is\ncrucial for successful deposition. The attempts of alternative deposition of layers of anion and cation modified\nnanoparticles without intermediate polyelectrolyte layers failed because the first layer peeled off during the\nattempted deposition of the second layer. This was most likely because of a poor adhesion of the first layer of\nnanoparticles to the substrate. In the spectra presented in Fig. 2 and 3 the main absorption bands were found at 405\nnm for CdS, and 290 nm for ZnS. Both of them are blue shifted from the respective absorption bands of 512 nm and\n335 nm for bulk CdS and ZnS materials. This is believed to be due to the effect of quantum confinement. The size\nof nanoparticles can be evaluated from the values of blue shift of the absorption bands [1, 15]. Similar spectra were\nobserved for CdS and ZnS nanoparticles capped with NH2+ groups.\nIn order to obtain the exact positions of absorption maxima, Gaussian fitting of absorption spectra re-plotted in\nenergy coordinates was performed similar to [16] and shown in Figures 3 (a) and (b). The observed energy\ndispersion may reflect the combination of the size distribution of nanoparticles and the presence of higher index\nenergy levels of size quantization. Only the first maximum (in each spectrum) corresponding to the ground state\nlevel was chosen for further analysis.\n300 400 500 600\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18\n0.20\n0.22\n0.24\n0.26\nA\nb\nso\nrb\nan\nce\nWavelength (nm)\n405 nm\n1\n4\n3\n2\n(a)\n200 300 400 500\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nA\nb\nso\nrb\nan\nce\nWavelength (nm)\n290 nm\n4\n3\n2\n1\n(b)\nFigure 2.

Woollam software allowed the \nextraction of optical parameters, such as the thickness (d) refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) of all\nconsecutively deposited layers. A multilayer model used for ellipsometry fitting, shown in Tables 2 and 3, consists\nof Si substrate, SiO2 layer representing a very thin (2-3 nm) film of native oxide, polyelectrolyte films of either\nPAH or PSS represented by Cauchy model, and the layers of either CdS or ZnS nanoparticles. The file names of\nmodels chosen from the VWASE32\uf0d2 library are shown near respective layers in Tables 2 and 3. The default\nmedium (air) was used everywhere. The parameters of all layers were obtained by fitting the spectra for\nconsecutively deposited layers and fixing the previously obtained parameters for the layers below. For the\ntransparent dielectric layers of polyelectrolyte (PAH or PSS) the value of k = 0 was fixed and the variables were the\nthickness (d) and the parameter A in the Cauchy dispersion model [14]:\n42 \uf06c\uf06c CBAn \uf02b\uf02b\uf03d (4)\nFor the layers of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles the model files of respective bulk materials were used, and all three\nparameters d, n, and k were varied during fitting.\nThe results of fitting are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. Although the whole spectra of n and k were obtained, only\nthe values at 633 nm are shown. The obtained thicknesses of nanoparticle layers of around 5 nm for both CdS and\nZnS correspond well to size of particles evaluated from UV-vis spectral data taking into account an additional\nthickness of the organic shell. The obtained larger thickness of the 2nd layer of CdS nanoparticles (in Table 2) is\nmost likely due to the aggregation of nanoparticles. The obtained values of n and, particularly, k deviate from the\nrespective values of bulk materials (n = 2.475, k = 0.0186 for CdS and n = 2.364, k = 0.0077 for ZnS). This may be\nattributed to the substantial increase in the oscillator strength due to the effect of quantum confinement [15]. The\nobtained values of refractive index for polyelectrolyte layers of 1.49 - 1.54 are quite typical for PAH and PSS films,\nwhile the thickness of around 2 nm is slightly larger than reported previously [12], which may be caused by\ninhomogeneous coating.\nTable 2.

The first PAH layer in Fig. 5 shows non-complete surface coverage. The next layer of\nPSS gives much more homogeneous coating. The first layer of CdS-SO3\u2013 reveal aggregates of nanoparticles of up to\n50 nm in size.

The formation of aggregates of electrically charged nanoparticles\nby intercalation with polyelectrolytes (f).\nA similar situation is observed for PAH\/ZnS-NH3+ films (see Fig. 6). The roughness of layers and aggregation of\nZnS-SO3\u2013 increases with the number of layers deposited. The size of ZnS-SO3\u2013 aggregates is about 40-50 nm.\nThe aggregation of either positively or negatively charged semiconductor nanoparticles can only happen by\nintercalation with the layers of polyanions (PSS) or polycations (PAH), respectively, as illustrated schematically by\nFigure 6(f). This also leads to the increase in the effective thickness of nanoparticle layers often observed for the\n2nd and following layers deposited.\nThe aggregation of nanoparticles can be reduced by using diluted colloid solutions. AFM images in Figure 7 show\nmuch smaller size of CdS clusters, when the layers were deposited from their diluted colloid solutions. In the case\nof 500 times dilution, small aggregates of 12-20 nm containing just a few CdS nanoparticles are clearly visible.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 7. Tapping mode AFM images (1\uf06dm in size) of CdS-NH2+ layers deposited from colloid solutions diluted in\n100 times (a) and 500 times (b).\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nMultilayers of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles films were successfully deposited onto quartz (glass) and silicon\nsubstrates using electrostatic self-assembly via PAH and PSS binding layers. The particle core radius in the range of\n1.8 - 1.9 nm for both CdS and ZnS nanoparticles was obtained from UV-vis absorption spectra. Ellipsometry gives\nslightly larger particle sizes of about 5 nm due to the contribution of the organic shell. AFM shows large (40-50 nm)\naggregates of electrically charged nano-particles, which are formed during their adsorption assisted by the\nintercalation with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes. The size of aggregates can be decreased down to 15-20 nm\nby diluting colloid solutions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Nabok A V, Richardson T, Davis F and Stirling C J M 1997 Langmuir 13 3198.\n[2] Erokhin V, Facci P, Gobbi L and Dante S 1998 Thin Solid Film 327-329 503\n[3] Schwarzacher W, Attenborough K, Michel A, Nabiyouni G and Meier J P 1997 Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic\nMaterials 165 23\n[4] Wade T L, Vaidyanathan R, Happek U and Stickney J L 2001 Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry 500 322-332\n[5] Lvov Y and Decher G 1994 Crystallography Reports vol. 39 p.628-649.\n[6] Fendler J H 1996 Chem.
