If the\notors turn counter-clockwise (CCW), the flagella come together\no form a spinning bundle and the cell swims forward (a run) for\n1.0 s. If one ormore of themotors turn clockwise (CW), the bundle\necomes unstable and the cell turns in place at random (a tum-\nle) for \u223c0.1 s, with no net displacement (Berg and Brown, 1972).\nhe purpose of a tumble is to reorient the cell to a new (random)\nirection. In the absence of an attractant gradient, this results in a\n\u2217 Corresponding author at: Centre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Insti-\nute, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3LB, United Kingdom.

Conversely, when con-\nditions deteriorate, the cell increases its chances of moving in a\nfavourable new direction by tumbling. This combination of run-\nand-tumble swimming and bias control leads to a drift velocity (in\nsteep gradient of attractant) of around \u223c7\u0002m\/s (Berg and Turner,\n1990). The response to attractant gradients is consistent with the\nWeber\u2013Fechner lawandgives a constant bias change in exponential\ngradients (Dahlquist, 2002).\nA detail often omitted frommost mathematical models of E. coli\nchemotaxis (e.g. see the reviewby Tindall et al., 2008) is that during\na tumble, reorientation is not perfect or complete, i.e. thenewdirec-\ntion is not chosen completely at random; instead, the bacterium is\n2 Biolog\nm\na\nt\n(\nb\ns\nb\ny\nf\no\na\np\na\nc\ne\ns\nt\np\nt\nt\no\nc\ns\n2\n(\ne\nt\ne\nc\ns\nn\nd\nv\na\n(\nb\np\n(\ne\np\n(\nr\nt\na\nl\na\nl\nr\ns\nt\ne\no\nt\ni\nt\nc\nc\nW\nt\no\na\nm70 D.V.

This was computed by tracking swimming\nacteria, recording the directional bearing during each individual\ntraight swim (run) and computing the absolute mean difference\netween successive run directions. Recently, Locsei (2007) anal-\nsed a model of run-and-tumble with directional persistence and\nound that, in theweak chemotaxis limit, this so-called \u2018persistence\nf direction\u2019 can increase the drift velocity of a bacterium up an\nttractant gradient by up to 38% relative to the memoryless case.\nHowever, it was also found in this analysis that the \u2018persistence\narameter\u2019 \u02db thatmaximises the drift velocity (\u02db=0.78) is larger by\nfactor of more than 2 compared with the value observed in live E.\noli (\u02db=0.33). This is intriguing, since in the absence of other influ-\nnces, one might expect evolution to have optimised the search\ntrategy so that the persistence observed in E. coli is close to the\nheoretically determined value that maximises the drift velocity (if\nersistence confers some selective advantage). A possible explana-\nion for the discrepancy may be that increasing drift velocity is not\nhe only determinant of optimal foraging. The in vivo persistence\nf direction may reflect a compromise between two (potentially\nompeting) aims, (1) to move quickly towards nutrients and (2) to\npend most of the time in regions of high nutrient density (Locsei,\n007), once these are located. While drift velocity is important for\n1), it says nothing at all about (2). A more balancedmeasure of the\nfficiency of the chemotactic strategy is the overall (ormean) quan-\nity of nutrient located over time. In this paper we investigate the\nffect of directional memory on the optimality of run-and-tumble\nhemotaxis by using this measure.\nA further piece of evidence in favour of directional persistence\nerving some function is that, in E. coli, the rate of signal termi-\nation and adaptation is larger than would be expected through\nephosphorylation alone. The chemotactic pathway directly inter-\nenes, via the protein CheZ, to terminate the signal \u2018early\u2019 (Bren et\nl., 1996). Since longer tumble times lead to more randomization\nless persistence), terminating the chemotactic signal early may\ne a way to enforce a shorter tumble time, thus implementing a\narticular value of directional persistence.\nThinking of evolution as a process of stochastic optimisation\nthat is, optimisation that incorporates probabilistic elements,\nither in theproblemdata or in the algorithm itself through random\narameter values or random choices) over the fitness landscape\nEdwards, 1987) leads to the natural question of when this \u2018algo-\nithm\u2019 is able to find the optimal solution to such an optimisation\nask. In general, due to the constraints on evolution, it is not guar-\nnteed that evolutionwould in fact visit the global optimum of this\nandscape (or remain there if this occurred). This would depend on\nnumber of factors such as the ruggedness and structure of the\nandscape, mutation-selection balance, themutation or replication\nate, the distribution of mutational jump distances on the land-\ncape, competition with other species and stochasticity (drift). We\nherefore suggested recently (Nicolau et al., in preparation) that an\nvolutionary strategy might be called evolutionarily optimal if it is\nptimal up to the limitations imposed by evolution as an optimisa-\nion strategy. Our investigation of the role of directional persistence\ns also motivated by this concept of the evolutionary (as opposed\no global) optimality of a biological strategy.\nTo gain insight into the evolution of directional persistence in E.\noli chemotaxis, and to understand its relationship to the optimal\nhemotactic strategy,weherepursue twocomplementaryanalyses.\nefirstly usedirectMonteCarlo simulations of amodel of run-and-\numble chemotaxis to determine the effect of directional memory\nn the efficiency of run-and-tumble in environmentswith different\nttractant gradients. We then simulate the evolution of directional\nemory (in isolation from other chemotactic mechanisms) in they and Chemistry 33 (2009) 269\u2013274\nsame environments and compare the results with those from the\ndirect simulation.\n2. Methods\nOur simulations in this paper are based on the model of bacte-\nrial chemotaxis proposed by Segall and Block (1986) and Schnitzer\n(1993). n bacteria are initially placed (and oriented) at random in\nthe 2D simulation space. An attractant is also placed in this space,\nwith a linear gradient so that the attractant concentration at the\npoint (x, y) is given by\nC(x, y) = max{cmax \u2212 k\n\u221a\n(x \u2212 x0)2 + (y \u2212 y0)2,0} (1)\nwhere k is the gradient, (x0, y0) is the origin and cmax is the con-\ncentration of attractant at the peak of the gradient. We assumed a\nlinear gradient because the slope k is a constant, allowing different\nsteepnesses of gradient to be directly compared. Simulations run\nwith a Gaussian attractant confirm that this does not change the\nfindings reported here.\nAt each pass of the algorithm, each bacterium is visited in\nturn, similarly to the algorithm described for molecular motion\nin Nicolau et al. (2007). In modelling chemotaxis, we follow the\napproach of Clark and Grant (2005). The cells compare their aver-\nage receptor occupancy, approximatedby the values ofC, between4\nand 1 s in the past, \u3008c\u30091\u20134, to the average receptor occupancy during\nthe past 1 s, \u3008c\u30090\u20131, to produce the biaser b= \u3008c\u30090\u20131 \u2212\u3008c\u30091\u20134. If b>0,\nthe cell reduces the tumbling rate \u0002 tumble from the ambient value\n\u0002 0 by an amount dependent on b: \u0002 tumble =\u0002 0 \u2212\u0003f(b), where f(b)\nis a monotonically increasing function of b and \u0003 is a sensitivity\ncoefficient that is positive for positive chemotaxis and negative for\nnegative chemotaxis. Following Clark and Grant (2005), we assume\nhere a linear relation, i.e. f(b)=b. We show in recent work (Nicolau\net al., in preparation) that simulations of the evolution for a digital\ngenotype coding for chemotactic swimming strategy indicate that\nthe characteristic time period of integration (the recent and distant\nwindows) is optimised by evolution to compensate for environ-\nmental noise. Here we assume the scale of temporal comparisons\nexperimentally determined for E. coli (1 and 3 s, for the recent and\ndistant windows respectively, see Nicolau et al., in preparation).\nWithout loss of generality, we set \u0003 , the sensitivity of the response\nof the bacterium to changes in attractant concentration, to 1. If b<0,\n\u0002 tumble is retained at the ambient value \u0002 0.\nIf a bacterium, i, is in a \u201crun\u201d, its orientation \u0004i and position pi\nare updated according to the system of equations:\n\u0004i(t + 1) = \u0004i(t) + \u0005Drot\npi(t + 1) = pi(t) + v\n(\ncos \u0004i\nsin \u0004i\n)\n(2)\nwhere Drot is the rotational diffusion coefficient (set to 0.15 rad2\/s,\nthe value in a mammalian gut, see Strong et al., 1998), \u0005=N(0, 1)\nand v is the mean velocity of the bacterium (25\u0002m\/s, Darnton et\nal., 2007).\nAfter each computation of the new position and orientation,\nthe simulation time t is incremented by an increment \u0131t (0.1 s in\nthis paper). A random number between 0 and 1, r, is compared to\n1\/\u0002 tumble. If r<1\/\u0002 tumble then the cell tumbles and chooses a new\ndirection:\n\u0004i(t + 1) = \u0004i(t) + \u03d1tumbleDrot (3)\nwhere \u03d1tumble is the persistence of direction parameter. Note that\nthe difference between (3) and the reorientation in Eq. (2) is in the\nmagnitude of \u03d1tumble. Persistence is defined differently here than\nin Locsei (2007) because of the different modelling approaches in\nthe two studies. If \u03d1tumble = 0 then the new direction is identical to\nBiology and Chemistry 33 (2009) 269\u2013274 271\nt\nr\n(\ns\nc\n3\n3\nt\ns\ns\nm\nr\nt\nfi\ne\na\n\u223c\nt\nt\ni\nb\nm\n1\nb\nc\no\nb\nn\na\n(\ne\nl\nF\na\nd\nt\nt\nn\ntD.V.

In E. coli, the mean angle between succes-\nive run directions has been found to be \u03d5 \u224863\u25e6 (Locsei, 2007),\norresponding to a directional persistence of \u22481.1 rad in ourmodel.\n. Results\n.1. Direct Simulation\nWe first investigated the effect of \u03d1tumble on the mean quan-\nity of attractant located by a population of n bacteria (Fig. 1). All\nimulation results presented here are obtained with n=200. The\nimulations were run for 1000 s of real time (based on the swim-\ning speed and body size of WT E. coli). Both of these values\neflect a compromise between numerical accuracy and computa-\nional resources. Unless otherwise stated, all data points in the\ngures are averages taken over the bacterial population.\nThe results show a transition between two regimes. If the gradi-\nnt is shallow (so that attractant is relatively evenly spread), above\ncharacteristic threshold value of \u03d1tumble (greater than 1.0 rad or\n55\u25e6), all strategies are approximately equal. Above this value, the\notal attractant acquired plateaus at a level dependent mainly on\nhe gradient. This threshold value varies very weakly with increas-\nng gradient. Variations in efficiency at high \u03d1tumble are dominated\ny simulation stochasticity. At high gradients, however, a maxi-\num efficiency is reached for values of \u03d1tumble between 0.9 and\n.1 rad.Values larger than this result in reducedefficiency. Theeffect\necomes increasingly important as gradients become steeper. The\nrossover between the two regimes takes place at gradient values\nf around 1.5 units of concentration per bacterial body diameter.\nThese data (Fig. 1) indicate that in environments characterised\ny shallow gradients, a preference for the forward hemisphere is\neither beneficial nor harmful as long as the reorientation during\ntumble ensures a minimum average reorientation, \u03d1tumble > 1.0\nor \u223c55\u25e6 between runs). Looking at the effect from the opposite\nnd, perfect reorientation is neither necessary nor harmful at shal-\now gradients. On the other hand, in steep-gradient environments,\nig. 1. Attractant acquired by a population (as a proportion of themaximum attain-\nble) versus the persistence parameter used by individuals in that population in\nifferent gradient environments (denoted \u201cgrad\u201d). A minimum degree of reorien-\nation (with a persistence parameter greater than a threshold of \u223c1.0) is necessary\no maximise efficiency; after this point, increasing the degree of reorientation does\not improve efficiency and in steeper gradient environments, it reduces it relative\no the optimal value. All values are means over the population.Fig. 2. Efficiency of chemotactic swimming predicted forWT E. coli, i.e. with amean\nof around 63\u25e6 between successive runs, relative to the complete reorientation case,\nas a function of varying directional persistence parameter \u03d1tumble. All values are\nmeans across the population.\ncomplete reorientation reduces the amount of attractant located.\nSimilarly to the low-gradient case, a minimum amount of reori-\nentation must be ensured but in contrast, if the gradient is large,\ntumbles causing extreme reorientation are harmful.\nTo further gain insight into this behaviour, we compared the\nrelative performance of the optimal directional persistence strat-\negy (\u03d1tumble = 1.1, or \u223c60\u25e6 between runs), denoted Effpersistence with\nthe perfect reorientation strategy (\u03d1tumble large, corresponding to\na mean of 90\u25e6 between runs), denoted Eff. The results are shown\nin Fig. 2 and confirm that in shallow gradients, directional memory\nhas no impact on the efficiency of chemotaxis while in high gradi-\nents, it outperforms perfect reorientation by around 40\u201350%. The\ntransition between these two regimes occurs in a small gradient\ninterval between 1.75 and 2 concentration units per bacterial body\nlength.\n3.2. Evolutionary Model\nWe now describe a variation of the model that was used to\nsimulate the evolution of directional persistence. Instead of fixing\nthe persistence parameter \u03d1tumble in each simulation experiment,\neach bacterium i is initially assigned an individual value of \u03d1tumble\n(denoted \u03d1tumble,i) of 0, corresponding to a complete inability to\ntumble. We then allow the values of the persistence parameter to\nevolve by natural selection over 100 generations. In the first gen-\neration, the simulation is run in the same way as described above\n(tmax =1000 s of real time based on the swimming speed of WT E.\ncoli, n=200). At the end of the generation, the bacteria that have\nacquired more attractant than the mean taken over the population\nare allowed to survive anddivide once. The other 50% of the popula-\ntion is removed from the simulation. Thismethod ensures constant\npopulation size, for simplicity.\nEach daughter cell is identical to the parent except that, to sim-\nulatemutation, its persistence is incremented by a random amount\n\u03d1tumble,child = \u03d1tumble,parent + \u0005m (4)\nwhere as above,\u0005=N(0, 1) andm is a positive parameter controlling\nthe rate of mutation. We chose m=0.4, a value that keeps simula-\ntion times manageable but the mean mutation in the persistence\nparameter to less than 0.25 per generation. Varying this value in\nthe range 0.1\u20130.6 does not change the outcome of the evolution but\naffects the speedof theprocess (thenumberof generations required\n2 Biology and Chemistry 33 (2009) 269\u2013274\nf\nv\np\nt\nc\ng\no\nt\n3\nF\nt\no\nb\n\u03d1\na\nn\nc\ni\nF\nt\na\na72 D.V.

This cycle is then repeated over 100\nenerations, keeping track in each generation of the mean amount\nf attractant acquired and the mean value of the persistence over\nhe population.\n.3. Results of In Silico Evolution\nEvolutionary sequences were run for different gradient values.\nig. 3 (top) shows the evolution of the mean population direc-\nional persistence. The results are broadly consistent with those\nf the direct simulations. In shallow gradients, because long tum-\nles are not harmful but short tumbles below the threshold of\n\u25e6\ntumble > 1.0 (corresponding to amean angle between runs of \u223c55 )\nre detrimental, individuals with large reorientation strategies are\not disfavouredwhile thosewith tumbles below this threshold are,\norrespondingly, less able to locate attractant. Selection thus results\nn an upwards drift of the mean persistence value, which diverges.\nig. 3. Evolution of populations placed in different attractant gradients.

There, the tug-of-war between these\ntwo effects, namely (1) the need for a minimum randomisation of\ndirection during a tumble and (2) the benefits obtained from lim-\niting the length of tumbles, results in a self-limiting evolutionary\ntrajectory and the mean population persistence plateaus at a value\nof around \u03d1tumble = 1.1 (corresponding to a mean angle between\nruns of around \u223c60\u25e6) after many generations. Fig. 3 (bottom)\nshows the mean amount of attractant found in each generation.\nAt shallower gradients, where variations in persistence are not cru-\ncial, a plateau is reached very quickly, while in steeper gradients,\nthe emergence of the optimum strategy requires more genera-\ntions.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Qualitative Features of the Evolutionary Runs\nA different way to visualise the evolution data is to plot persis-\ntence on one axis and the efficiency (attractant found) on the other,\nas in Fig. 4. These series (whichwe call \u201cevolution characteristics\u201d in\nwhat follows) contain three importantpiecesof information. Firstly,\nthe total length of each characteristic in the horizontal direction\nshows the digital \u201cgenotype space\u201d explored by the population.\nThus a horizontally short characteristic indicates a self-limiting\nevolutionary process with a (finite) optimal genotype, as is the case\nin the large-gradient case here (bottom characteristic). A long char-\nacteristic indicates no equilibrium (corresponding to a global or\nlocal optimum) was found in the evolutionary run (but that does\nnot mean that one does not exist).\nSecondly, the vertical size of each characteristic is an indication\nof the sensitivity of the fitness (attractant found, in this case) to the\ngenotype (persistence, in this case) over the generations. Consis-\ntently with the discussion above, the sensitivity of the efficiency on\nthe reorientation strategy is highest in steep gradient environments\n(bottom characteristic, shown with vertical braces) and lowest in\nshallow gradient environments (top curve).\nThirdly, each characteristic shows two regimes along the hor-\nizontal axis, (a) an initial rapid increase in the population mean\nBiolog\np\nc\ns\ni\nt\nc\ni\nt\nn\nd\n4\np\ns\nn\ns\nr\nt\ni\nv\nr\np\na\n\u03d1\ni\nc\nc\nl\na\na\nb\nm\n\u03d1\nt\nv\n2\nw\nd\np\nt\nw\nm\ns\na\nb\nb\n0\nt\nw\nC\ni\nh\ni\nm\ns\nl\nm\na\nn\nl\nm\ntD.V.

The elongation of this cluster\ns an indication of the sensitivity of selection associated with digi-\nal genotype changes near the equilibrium. Thus, the equilibrium\nluster for the high-gradient case is the most compact, because\nndividuals with \u03d1tumble > 1.25 or \u03d1tumble < 0.9 are very unlikely\no reproduce (x-direction) and because small changes in \u03d1tumble\near the equilibrium \u03d1tumble result in large changes in fitness (y-\nirection).\n.2. The Role of Persistence and Exploration versus Exploitation\nWe report that in a model of run-and-tumble chemotaxis in the\nresence of a linear attractant profile, a moderate directional per-\nistence is beneficial (in sharp gradient environments) or at least\neutral (in shallow gradient environments) as long as the randomi-\nation during a tumble is above a threshold value of \u223c55\u25e6. These\nesults are consistentwith the conclusions of Locsei (2007), namely\nhat directional persistence is beneficial, presumably by increas-\nng drift velocity. We find that, in the former regime, the optimal\nalue of \u03d1tumble = 1.1\u00b10.15, corresponding to \u03d5 =63\u25e6 \u00b19\u25e6 between\nuns, while in E. coli, \u03d5 \u224863\u25e6 between runs. This finding is sup-\norted independently both by the in silico evolution data and by\ndirect brute force search through the range of possible values of\ntumble. These results suggest that persistence of direction not only\nncreases chemotactic drift in isolation from any other aims of the\nhemotactic strategy (such as remaining in a region of high nutrient\noncentration, once having drifted there), but is in fact both evo-\nutionarily and globally optimal in the context of run-and-tumble\nnd specifically at a parameter set very near to that found in vivo\nnd identified by simulations of the model. Its effect is substantial\nut moderate: even in the steep-gradient regime (k=2\u20132.5), 45%\nore attractant is located with a \u03d1tumble = 1.1 strategy than with a\ntumble = 5 (complete reorientation) strategy. This is consistentwith\nhe analysis of Locsei, who found a difference of 38% in mean drift\nelocity up a gradient between the two equivalent cases (Locsei,\n007). In the shallow-gradient regime,we report that, in the frame-\nork of ourmodel, persistence of direction is neither beneficial nor\netrimental, so long as a minimum amount of reorientation takes\nlace during a tumble.\nThese results are not counter-intuitive. If persistence of direc-\nion is a means of increasing chemotactic drift velocity, then one\nould expect its impact to be greatest in steep-gradient environ-\nents, in which this function is more important. More generally, in\nhallow-gradient environments, the specific chemotactic strategy\nnd chemotactic ability in a broad sense, would not be expected to\ne as important as in steep-gradient environments. This point can\ne illustrated by noting that in the limit as the gradient tends to\n, an organism with no chemotactic ability (e.g. an immotile bac-\neriumdiffusing at random)would locate asmuch attractant as one\nith a highly efficient and sophisticated chemotaxis mechanism.\nonversely, in the limit as the gradient becomes large, differences\nn attractant concentration become large over small distances and\nence the ability to move to favourable regions quickly becomes\nncreasingly important.\nWhy might evolution select for directional memory, i.e. why\night directional memory increase chemotactic efficiency? A\ntraightforward answer is that since tumbles that reorient to a\nevel just above the minimum threshold (Fig. 3) result in maxi-\numefficiency, there is no selective advantage fromspending large\nmounts of time in unnecessarily long reorienting tumbleswithout\net displacement in a favourable direction. Therefore minimally\nong tumbles may simply be a way to partition swimming time\nore efficiently (since tumbles result in little net displacement and\nherefore no favourable drift).y and Chemistry 33 (2009) 269\u2013274 273\nIt has also recently been shown using a continuous mathe-\nmatical model of E. coli chemotaxis that persistence of direction\nincreases drift velocity up a gradient (Locsei, 2007). However, we\nspeculate that this is not the only direct (as opposed to indirectly\nincreasing efficiency by reducing tumbling time) reason. Firstly, our\nsimulation times are so large (1000 s) compared with the average\ndrift time (tens of seconds for the gradients used here) that the\nvast majority of the simulation time is spent near the maximum,\ndrifting up and down a narrow portion of the gradient, where this\neffect would be small. Secondly, increasing drift velocity would be\nexpected to have a larger effect when the typical gradient distance\nis large (shallow gradients) and a smaller one when the width is\nsmaller (sharp gradients). In contrast, our results indicate that the\ndirectional persistence function is only useful in sharp-gradient\nenvironments, where again this effect would be less important.\nWepropose that anothereffect is atplay inaddition (not inoppo-\nsition) to increased drift velocity. This is based on the observation\nthat a very large value of persistence (reorientation) is associated\nwith a significant probability of choosing a new direction that is\nclose to the old direction due to the periodicity of direction; that\nis, reorienting for a long time is more likely to result in a new\ndirection close to thepreviousdirection, than reorienting for amod-\nerate time. Thus, a slight preference for the forward hemisphere\ndecreases the chance of choosing such a direction and paradoxi-\ncally may be better at producing reorientation steps that result in a\nnew direction that is on average perpendicular to the old direction\n(i.e. complete orthogonal reorientation). This may lead to a more\nefficient algorithm for partitioning the search space (Hanson et al.,\n2006).\nIt is intriguing that the optimal value of \u03d1tumble varies very\nweakly with attractant gradient. In the shallow gradient regime,\nthe \u03d1tumble threshold above which tumbles are sufficiently dis-\norientating is also a weak function of the gradient. Over all the\ncases considered here, we find (both through in silico evolution and\ndirect Monte Carlo simulation) that 0.95<\u03d1tumble < 1.25 is always\noptimal. This is a rather narrow window, corresponding to only a\n\u223c15\u25e6 difference in forward hemisphere preference. One possibility\nis that the optimal range would be different for different attrac-\ntant profiles. However, in our simulations, using different gradient\nforms (e.g. Gaussian, quadratic, etc.) does not considerably affect\nthe results. Using randomly placed multiple, additive, sources of\nattractant with these forms also does not alter our findings (data\nnot shown).\nWespeculate that the slimness of this optimal range results from\na compromise between two different aims of spatially \u201cblind\u201d for-\naging strategies (without the ability to compute gradients locally,\nrelying instead on temporal comparisons) and that it is a univer-\nsal property of such algorithms in two dimensions. The first of\nthese two aims is to explore as much of the available space as\npossible in the shortest time possible. This is maximised by trav-\neling in a straight line with no reorientations, \u03d1tumble = 0 (ballistic\nmotion). The second aim is to explore (or occupy) space locally once\na favourable region has been found. This is achieved with frequent\nreorientations and large values of \u03d1tumble and in the limit as this\nparameter tends to infinity, leads to pure diffusion or sub-diffusion.\nThese two aims are competing. The region between the two\nlimits corresponds to superdiffusion, a diffusion-like process char-\nacterised by the mean squared distance of a particle (organism)\nfrom its starting site varying with a fixed power of time called the\nanomalous exponent (usually denoted \u02db), with 1<\u02db<2 (Nicolau et\nal., 2007). If small changes in the exploration strategy (captured by\nthe anomalous exponent) lead to large changes in the respective\nbenefits obtained independently from these two functions (explo-\nration and exploitation), then the region of compromise would be\nexpected to be narrow. This in turn would translate, in the case\nof superdiffusion by directional memory (as opposed to e.g. Levy\n2 Biolog\nfl\no\nfi\nr\nl\nw\ns\n(\na\ng\no\nr\nt\nr\no\nr\nn\ns\nc\ns\nt\ni\nc\ni\nm\ni\nS\nt\ne\nr\nt\ne\no\nh\np\nt\ns\nt\n5\nt\nb\ne\np\na\nt\np\nc\na\nt\np74 D.V. Nicolau Jr. et al. \/ Computational\nights), into a narrow region for \u03d1tumble. Measurements of \u03d1tumble\nr comparable parameters for other foraging systems would con-\nrm (or deny) this supposition. For example, Hanson et al. (2006)\neport that filamentous fungi exploring microconfined geometries\naunchdaughter hypha at\u223c70\u25e6 to theparent hypha\u2013not 90\u25e6, which\nould maximise the efficiency of spatial partitioning.\nDeviations from diffusive search behaviour to subdiffusion or\nuperdiffusion appear to be ubiquitous at all biological scales\nViswanathan et al., 1999) including cell membranes (Nicolau et\nl., 2007) and human travel (Brockmann et al., 2006). These strate-\nies have presumably evolved in order to maximise the efficiency\nf searching in different kinds of environments. Understanding the\nelationship between the distribution of a resource of interest in\nhe environment and the evolved search strategy (and its super-,\nespectively, sub-diffusivity) is an important challenge in the study\nf foraging behaviour and its evolution.\nIn recent work (Nicolau et al., in preparation) we show how a\nun-and-tumble-like chemotactic swimming strategy can emerge\naturally from simulations of an evolutionary process and how in\nilico evolution can reproduce the observed properties of E. coli\nhemotaxis and related bacteria down to fine quantitative details\nuch as the scale of temporal comparisons, running and tumbling\nimes and the persistence-of-direction property. Given these find-\nngs and the very high efficiencypredictedhere for run-and-tumble\nhemotaxis, we might expect that all bacteria employ this forag-\nng strategy. There are myriad factors not considered in this crude\nodel, including energy consumption, bacterial size, turbulence\nn the environment and number of attractant or repellent sources.\neveral different chemotaxis strategies for bacteria have been iden-\nified to date, including run-and-stop and run-and-reverse (Porter\nt al., 2008). Presumably these have arisen because different envi-\nonments place different pressures on foraging micro-organisms.\nA challenge for the future is to shed light on the factors that con-\nribute to the efficiency of a foraging strategy in a particular type of\nnvironment. For example, are strategies that use directionalmem-\nry or superdiffusion efficient in a patchy food environment? If so,\now does the optimal anomalous exponent or directional memory\narameter vary with the patch density and size distribution? Are\nhe efficiencies of run-and-tumble, run-and-reverse and run-and-\ntop different relative to the characteristic environments in which\nhe respective bacteria live?\n. Conclusions\nWe considered the variation in chemotactic efficiency as a func-\nion of the persistence of direction (and its evolution) for model\nacteria resemblingE. coli.Weusedasimplifiedversionof adetailed\narlier model to investigate this in depth by directly representing\nersistence of direction as a parameter in the model rather than\ns an effect due to time spent tumbling. A brute force search of\nhe persistence parameter space shows that a minimum value of\n\u25e6ersistence of direction of \u223c60\u201365 is required to achieve optimal\nhemotaxis in shallow gradients but that in steep gradients there is\nsmall penalty associated with overly reorienting tumbles. Evolu-\nionary simulations confirm these findings and show that a digital\nopulation evolves a persistence corresponding to that measuredy and Chemistry 33 (2009) 269\u2013274\nin E. coli only in steep gradients but that in shallow gradients large\nreorientations are favoured. We speculate on the reasons why a\npreference for the forward hemisphere might arise from an evolu-\ntionary process, concluding that three factors may be at play, with\nthe effects of these being roughly additive: (a) minimising the time\nspent tumbling (which is not being used to explore new areas), (b)\nincreasing drift speed up a gradient and (c) optimally partition-\ning the search space to find a compromise between exploration\nand exploitation.We present a newmethod of graphically visualis-\ning the evolution of a biological trait or function, which we call an\nevolutionary characteristic.\nAcknowledgements\nDVN was supported by a Clarendon Scholarship from Oxford\nUniversity, a Devorguilla Scholarship from Balliol College and the\nMiller Fellowship from the Miller Institute for Basic Research in\nScience, University of California at Berkeley.
