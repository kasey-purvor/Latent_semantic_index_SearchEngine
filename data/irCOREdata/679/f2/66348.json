We are, by our nature, explanatory animals. Reasons give us\na handle on the world, they put events in order and make them understandable\nand, sometimes, predictable. A need for reasons can be motivating and, when\nfound, surprisingly satisfying. Knowledge stitched together with reasons can\nalso be very durable (Newton, 2000). There was a time in schools, more than a\ncentury ago, when naming bays and capes was sufficient for a geography lesson\n(Graves, 2001). This is not so now. Geography does not simply describe the world\nbut aims to explain it (Becher, 1994). This does not mean that facts are unimpor-\ntant: without them there would be nothing to explain. The explaining, however,\ncalls for reasons and \u2018higher order thinking\u2019 to knit the facts into more or less\ncoherent understandings (van der Schee et al., 2003; Vankan, 2003). This is\nreflected in requirements for school geography. For example, the National\nCurriculum for Geography for England (DfEE\/QCA, 1999: 110\u201313) requires that\nchildren between the ages of 5 and 11 years develop \u2018knowledge and under-\nstanding of places, patterns and processes, and environmental change and\nIRGEE 185\n1038-2046\/06\/01 0029-12 $20.00\/0 \u00a9 2006 L.D.

In connection with places, for instance, children must\nlearn \u2018why places change\u2019 and \u2018why places are similar to and different from other\nplaces in the world\u2019. Relating to patterns and processes, they must \u2018explain\npatterns made by individual physical and human features in the environment\u2019.\nTo do with environmental change and development, they must know \u2018why\npeople may seek to manage environments sustainably\u2019. Each of these calls for a\ngrasp of causal and purposive reasons embedded in explanations that, together,\nconstitute understandings (Newton, 2000). In addition, in the UK, the National\nCurriculum for geography requires that children should practise \u2018geographical\nenquiry and skills\u2019 (DfEE\/QCA, 1999). To the extent that the children should\nknow the reasons underpinning their actions, this also calls for causal and\npurposive understandings, otherwise these actions would be only rule-driven\nprocedures (QCA, 1998a).\nTeaching for causal understanding\nEnglish primary school teachers (teaching children of 5 to 11 years) generally\nhave to teach most subjects of the National Curriculum, whatever their own\neducational background. Many of them will have only an elementary education\nin geography. Such teachers are known to avoid reasons and emphasise the\nacquisition of facts. Catling (1999a: 284) has pointed to, for example, the way\nprimary school teachers \u2018have a limited appreciation of the key ideas in geog-\nraphy and find it difficult to engage children in seeking explanations and in\nmaking generalisations\u2019. As Hattie (2004) has described, subject content knowl-\nedge is an important aspect of classroom success of a teacher. Without it,\nconfidence in teaching can be low and avoidance of causal explanation high\n(Carlsen, 1991). To add to the problem in the UK, teacher training courses for the\nprimary school do not have to have a strand dealing with geography and \u2018taster\u2019\ncourses can be short and superficial (TTA, 2003). But even teachers with a strong\nbackground in a subject may not be able to transform it into a form they can teach\n(Geddis, 1993; Holt-Reynolds, 1999; Lee, 2003; Martin, 2000) or may avoid\nreasons in the belief that knowing why is beyond young children (e.g. Newton &\nNewton, 2000). As Martin (2000: 242) succinctly puts it, \u2018Expertise in a subject\ndoes not mean expertise as a teacher of the subject\u2019.\nAs far as the children are concerned, there is ample evidence that they can\ngrasp causal reasoning. The basics of causal reasoning are well established by\nfour years of age. While the ability to notice relationships, ascribe them accu-\nrately and manipulate them has limits, the potential to understand cause and\npurpose is present from an early age (Goswami, 1998; Halford, 1993; Kuhn et al.,\n1995). Meltzoff (1995) concluded that even 18-month infants have some grasp of\nphysical causality (that explains the behaviour of things) and psychological\ncausality (that explains the behaviour of people through their goals and\npurposeful acts). On this basis, teachers might reasonably be expected to foster\nthe development of simple causal explanations in geography lessons. Those who\nlack a grasp of geography, however, could have a problem with this. Similarly,\nthose unable to transform their knowledge could find it difficult. There is also a\nstrong tendency for the novice (newly qualified teacher) and non-specialist\nteacher (without a strong background in geography) to teach in the way they\nwere taught when children themselves (Moallem, 1998). Models from the past\n30 International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education\nIRGEE 185\nC:\\edrive\\Irgee-old\\15-1-old\\irgee15-1.vp\nThursday, August 24, 2006 10:00:57\nColor profile: Disabled\nComposite  Default screen\nmay not be relevant to current approaches and expectations. Even teachers who\nknow something of the subject may avoid causal explanation (Martin, 2000).\nTaken together, this suggests that an avoidance of causal explanations, reasons\nand \u2018higher order\u2019 thinking could be a significant problem in the primary class-\nroom. Is there some ready and convenient source of support?\nThe textbook as a guide to teaching\nRymarz and Engebretson (2005) addressed the same problem in teaching reli-\ngious education in the secondary school in Australia, where it is may be taught\nby non-specialists. They found that a textbook was welcomed by most teachers\nand particularly by those who were not specialists in religious education (for the\nsame in other contexts, see Grossman et al., 1989; Issitt, 2004; Newton et al., 2002).\nThey concluded that the textbook helped by enabling and enhancing the\nteaching, letting teachers see what to teach and what mattered most, helping\nthem teach it in more depth, and by guiding their assessment of learning. The\neffect on the students was significant. They had better attitudes to religious\neducation and the quality of learning was better. This textbook was one that had\nbeen prepared for the task, a process that can be expensive in terms of time and\nmoney. The question is, could existing books be used in this way in geography? If\nso, it could be an easy solution to the problem with the advantage that teachers\ncould choose the books they are comfortable with. Before exploring this further,\nhowever, there can be some prejudice against book use that has to be considered.\nIssitt (2004) has pointed out that, although textbooks are universally used, they\nare often derided in the UK. To confess to relying on a book is tantamount to\nbroadcasting your ignorance, laziness or both. It is assumed that the children\nlearn, if at all, by the passive acquisition of information from the page. But the\nbook is only an object; it is a tool to teach with and how it is used depends on the\nteacher. Teachers with knowledge of a subject often use a book flexibly and selec-\ntively while those low in experience, subject knowledge and confidence often\nrely on a book to tell them what is appropriate and to support their classroom\ndiscourse (see e.g. Grossman et al., 1989; Newton et al., 2002). As Rymarz and\nEngebretson (2005) found out, a non-specialist with a book is often better than\none without. This depends, however, on there being books that address the\nproblem. Here, this means providing for causal understanding. Could primary\nschool geography textbooks help teachers \u2018emphasize understanding, reasoning\nand connections amongst ideas\u2019 (Borko & Putnam, 1996: 686). In particular, do\nthey provide reasons? As Lipman (1991) has succinctly put it, to foster reasoning,\nwe need books that embody and model it. Catling (1999b), however, has pointed\nto a lack of research in this area. This study seeks to answer the question and then\nconsiders some implications.\nThe Study\nClauses of cause and purpose\nHere, operationally, causal understanding is taken to mean being able to\nprovide reasons for events and situations, that is, knowing why. Statements of\ncause and purpose are intended to help a reader know why. The former provide\nthe reasons as a causal relationship and the latter provide them as a purpose,\nCause and Purpose in Children\u2019s Geography Books 31\nIRGEE 185\nC:\\edrive\\Irgee-old\\15-1-old\\irgee15-1.vp\nThursday, August 24, 2006 10:00:58\nColor profile: Disabled\nComposite  Default screen\nintention or function. For instance, \u2018Grass stops the dunes moving because it\ntraps the sand amongst its stems and roots\u2019, states a fact and explains it with a\ncause. Similarly, \u2018The workforce went on strike in order to obtain better condi-\ntions\u2019, explains the strike by its purpose. Assuming that writers do not\ndeliberately avoid such statements, we would expect to find them in their expla-\nnations. Working with expository text, Graesser and Hemphill (1991: 206) show\nthat teleological explanations (that is, explanation by purpose, intent or function)\nare more likely in biological and technological text than in text about physics. To\nillustrate, for text in \u2018The Last Word\u2019 answers to readers\u2019 questions (a regular\ncolumn in New Scientist), a random sample of 45 answers to physical science\nquestions, revealed 4.4% of physical causes and no clauses of purpose. In a\nsimilar sample of 42 responses to technological questions, 16.7% of the clauses\nprovided purposes and none provided physical causes. This shows that the inci-\ndence of clauses of cause and purpose can point to the explanatory flavour of\ntext. It is not to say that writers use only these explanatory devices but that their\nincidence indicates a concern for certain kinds of causal relationship.\nMaterials\nA textbook was taken to be \u2018a focused educational programme in text allied to a\nscheme of work\u2019 and for use by learners (Issitt, 2004: 65). Teacher training educa-\ntion libraries and resource centres were the source of an opportune sample of\nsuch books. Twenty-nine textbooks for teaching National Curriculum geog-\nraphy in Key Stage 2 (for children aged 7 to 11 years in the primary school) were\nanalysed.\nProcedure\nThe analysis had two stages. In the first stage, the text was divided into clauses\n(a combination of words in which something is said about something else using a\nfinite verb). Clauses are commonly used as units of textual analysis (Weber, 1990)\nand these formed the data pool. The pool included questions directed at the\nreader where the answer would be a cause or purpose. Clauses of cause (typi-\ncally signalled by words like as, because, since) and purpose (typically signalled\nby in order to, to, so that) were noted. When these signals are not used, supplying\nthem can test the function of the clause (Greenbaum, 1996). The proportions of\ncause and purposes clauses were recorded for each book. The cause and purpose\nclauses were also classified according to the causal agent. The agent may be\nanimate (human or other) or inanimate (physical). For instance, a purpose clause\nwith human agency is involved in: \u2018He took medicine in order to get well\u2019. A\npurpose clause with animate, non-human agency is involved in: \u2018The flower has\na scent to attract insects\u2019. A cause clause with an inanimate agent is involved in:\n\u2018This happens because water presses equally in all directions\u2019. This stage stems\nfrom an approach developed for analysing discourse in the classroom and in text\n(Newton & Newton, 2000; Newton et al., 2002).\nDescriptive and inferential statistics help make some generalisations apparent.\nNevertheless, an understanding of the data must draw on a direct examination of\nclauses and books. In the second stage, the data pool of clauses was subjected to a\nphenomenographic analysis to identify how these clauses were used. This\ninvolved an iterative sort of the clauses into groups or categories on the basis of\n32 International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education\nIRGEE 185\nC:\\edrive\\Irgee-old\\15-1-old\\irgee15-1.vp\nThursday, August 24, 2006 10:00:58\nColor profile: Disabled\nComposite  Default screen\ntheir similarities. Categories were re-sorted, if necessary, as successive clauses\nwere considered. At the end of the process, the attributes of each category were\nmade explicit and illustrated by representative examples. In this instance, the\naim of the sort was to identify different ways in which the clauses were used so\nthe categories reflected that. (For a full account of the general procedure, see\nMarton, 1981.)\nThe textual analysis was done by a primary teacher trained for the purpose by\nthe authors and experienced in teaching with and using books of this kind with\n7\u201311 year olds. Such text usually has a simple structure to increase the likelihood\nthat children will grasp its meaning. This tends to make most of the analysis\nunproblematic. The few instances of uncertainty were discussed and a consensus\nregarding the classification obtained.\nSampling\nIgnoring title and index pages, each book was divided into quarters. The\nbeginnings and ends of the topics under discussion at these quarter points were\nlocated and the text between was parsed into clauses. On average, this amounted\nto about 300 clauses per book. (For a 32 page book, for example, these would typi-\ncally be drawn from some eight pages.) This process allows for the possibility\nthat the expositional style may vary throughout a book. All the books included\nillustrations. Text in illustrations that occurred in the samples was analysed\nsimilarly.\nResults\nThe incidence of clauses of cause and purpose\nClauses of cause ranged from nil to 5.30% of text with a mean of 1.65% (s.d.\n1.32). Ten books had less than 1% of such clauses. Clauses of purpose ranged\nfrom nil to 11.00% of text with a mean of 4.29% (s.d. 2.67). One book had less than\n1% of such clauses. On average, there were more than twice as many clauses of\npurpose as clauses of cause. (This difference was statistically significant: t-test, p\n< 0.0000.)\nFigure 1 shows the clause proportions in each book. The samples from Books 1\nand 2, for example, contained relatively high percentages of purpose clauses. The\nsamples from many books (those to the right of the graph) contained relatively\nfew and one (Book 29) had none. While on average, clauses of cause were not\nespecially common, the percentage of cause clauses exceeded that of purpose\nclauses in three books (23, 28, 29). Clauses of cause, however, were absent in the\nsamples from Books 2, 3, 17, 27.\nHow the clauses were used\nThe interpretation of such figures rests on the phenomenographic analysis\nwhich helped to identify several uses of the cause and purpose clauses. It is\nimportant to add that this kind of analysis identifies categories in a given data\npool (consisting of 245 clauses here). This does not mean that there will be no\nother categories in the population at large. While the size of each category has\nbeen indicated, the figures should be taken as indicative only. Additional books\ncould alter the proportions.

For example:\n\u2018Although many scientists use the amount of rainfall to classify an area as a\ndesert . . . \u2019\nThere were similarly several uses of clauses of cause.\nCategory 4: Explaining physical effects in specific environments\nThese clauses of cause, accounting for some 21% of the data pool, were associ-\nated with explaining aspects of physical science.

Because of this, few other plants grow beneath\nthe trees\u2019.\n\u2018In hilly areas, there are few railways, because trains cannot go up steep\nslopes\u2019.\n\u2018Oak is a late arrival because it does not grow as quickly as other species\u2019.\n\u2018This is because winters are sunny\u2019.\n\u2018Few plants or animals can live in the desert because there is not enough water\nfor them\u2019.\n\u2018The Gobi Desert has hardly any water because it is in the middle of the huge\nAsian continent\u2019.\nCategory 5: Explaining human action in specific environments\nThese clauses (4% of the data pool) were associated with explaining people\u2019s\nactions by transferring the cause to an inanimate body. For those with insuffi-\ncient prior knowledge, the explanations beg the question. For example:\n\u2018Because of the needs of modern forestry, conifers have now replaced large\nareas of natural deciduous woodland\u2019.\n\u2018Tourists come to this large village because it has the longest place name in the\nBritish Isles\u2019.\nCategory 6: Explaining the meaning of terms\nThis small category (about 1% of the data pool) comprised clauses of cause\nassociated with explaining words and expressions and names of places. For\nexample:\n\u2018There is also a lot of rain all the year round. Because of this, these forests are\noften called tropical rainforests\u2019.\n\u2018The Gobi is called a continental desert because it\u2019s in the middle of a\ncontinent\u2019.\nDiscussion\nWe do not claim that explanation depends entirely on clauses of cause or\npurpose. However, we do claim that counts of these clauses can be general\nCause and Purpose in Children\u2019s Geography Books 35\nIRGEE 185\nC:\\edrive\\Irgee-old\\15-1-old\\irgee15-1.vp\nThursday, August 24, 2006 10:00:59\nColor profile: Disabled\nComposite  Default screen\nindicators of a concern for causal understanding. Nevertheless, an examination\nof the text itself is essential to identify the kinds of understanding that the book\nmight support. To that end, distinctive uses of explanation in the books were\nidentified. Knowledgeable and skilled teachers may be able to use any book to\nsupport causal understanding. These are not the teachers likely to need help.\nAttention here is more on the novice, those who cannot translate their knowledge\ninto teaching discourse and those who lack relevant knowledge. To what extent\ncould these books help such teachers engage effectively with causal under-\nstanding in geography?\nThe first point is that there was a wide variation in the books\u2019 provision of\ncausal explanations: many books provided relatively few or none at all. We\nfound no evidence that these used other pedagogical devices to support causal\nunderstanding. In effect, they are latter-day cape and bay books but now their\nfacts are about, for instance, human influences on the environment. These books\nwould probably be unable to redirect a teacher\u2019s attention to causal under-\nstanding. On the other hand, some of the other books did provide a significant\namount of causal explanation. But the mere presence of causal explanation does\nnot, in itself, indicate that these books would be useful. Their utility depends on\nthe kind of explanation they support (and, of course, how they are used by the\nteacher).\nRecall that the National Curriculum requires attention to places (e.g. \u2018why\nplaces change\u2019, \u2018why places are similar to and different from other places in the\nworld\u2019), patterns and processes (e.g. \u2018understanding patterns made by indi-\nvidual physical and human features in the environment\u2019), and environmental\nchange and sustainable development (e.g. why people may seek to manage envi-\nronments sustainably) (DfEE\/QCA, 1999: 110\u201313). Categories 1 and 2 (Explaining\nthe behaviour and adaptation of plants and non-human animals in specific environments\nand Explaining physical effects in specific environments) accounted for the over-\nwhelming majority of causal explanations in the data pool. These tended to\nexplain why places, particularly their living parts, are as we see them. Science,\nespecially natural science, was the causal component in the explanations. Cate-\ngories 2 and 5 (both Explaining human action in specific environments) accounted for\nmuch of the remaining use of causal explanation. The categories tended to relate\nto people in their environment and how their behaviour was tuned to exploit it.\nIn short, some books could have the kind of content that would point a teacher in\nthe right direction for these aspects of the National Curriculum. On the other\nhand, there was little evidence of content that might foster the understanding of,\nfor instance, procedures that the children might use in their geographical\nenquiry, as required by the National Curriculum for Geography (DfEE\/QCA,\n1999).\nFrom this we conclude that there were books that could lead a teacher to\naddress reasons relating to places, patterns and processes, environmental\nchange and sustainable development, although to different degrees. A teacher\nwould probably need to draw on more than one book for a comprehensive exem-\nplification. This is not to say that these books will help a teacher. The analysis says\nnothing about the quality of the explanations or the quality of the writing and\nsupport for the exposition. None of the books analysed would be of much use in\ndirecting a teacher to address reasons in geographical enquiry. Such books may\n36 International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education\nIRGEE 185\nC:\\edrive\\Irgee-old\\15-1-old\\irgee15-1.vp\nThursday, August 24, 2006 10:00:59\nColor profile: Disabled\nComposite  Default screen\nexist but the danger is that, if teachers did not happen upon one, they may\naddress geographical enquiry without a concern for the reasons that underpin\nwhat the children do.\nThe uneven concern for causal understanding in the books adds a problem.\nTeachers who are unclear about the kinds of understanding that should be\nsupported may be unable to choose a book that points them in the right direction.\nThey may, in practice, choose one that reinforces their existing teaching. Which\nbrings us back to the beginning and to training. The training cannot simply be a\ncry for more subject content knowledge. As Martin (2000) has explained, simply\nraising subject knowledge is not enough. First, those on initial teacher training\ncourses need to have a clear picture of what counts as learning in primary school\ngeography. Further, they need to know that this includes various kinds of under-\nstanding and they must be clear what these are. Given this, they need to be\ntrained to evaluate textbooks and choose those that satisfy the requirements,\nparticularly in those areas where they, themselves, are weak. Next, they need to\nlearn how to use these books imaginatively with children, avoiding lessons\nbecoming nothing more than the passive acquisition of information. Writers\ntoday often go to great lengths to engage the reader\u2019s thinking with the subject.\nWhere they do not, there are many strategies the teacher can use to make good\nthe deficiency (Newton, 1990).\nCourses for practising teachers are often short. On such courses, there is\nalways a tension between satisfying the teacher\u2019s desire for teaching tips and\ndeveloping understanding for the long term. The above procedure seems to offer\nsome potential for helping them improve their geography teaching while feeling\nthat they are engaged in something directly relevant to the classroom. There is,\nhowever, another source of help. If the subject coordinator (the teacher respon-\nsible for leading geography in the school) is also aware of the potential of some\nbooks to support some aspects of teaching and learning, he or she may choose the\nschool\u2019s books in conjunction with the teachers. It may mean that a single book\nseries may not be the outcome of such a choice. The loss of this uniformity may be\noffset by teachers who are more comfortable with what they teach. It does,\nhowever, mean that the coordinator will have to ensure that there is progression\nand that requirements are met.\nFor those who cannot or do not attend courses, the textbook could be a source\nof some self-improvement. Some time ago, the Qualifications and Curriculum\nAuthority (QCA, 1998b) produced schemes of work for geography which\ndescribe what might be taught. Many have found this of some use. Nevertheless,\nit leaves a gap between plans and practice. A textbook could be a means of\ncrossing that gap. It takes subject content knowledge to the children with\nlanguage, analogies and examples that are meaningful to them \u2013 if, of course, you\nhave the \u2018right\u2019 one. Some of those examined here could serve as a bridge \u2013 up to a\npoint.\nUsing books in this way may risk them becoming straitjackets that eventually\nlimit or contains a teacher\u2019s development. Hopkin (2001: 63) has described how\nbooks can \u2018mediate the reality of the world and reproduce particular geographies\nfor pupils (and for teachers)\u2019. Once written, these particular geographies can be\nlong-lived, but books do change with time and respond to new expectations\nCause and Purpose in Children\u2019s Geography Books 37\nIRGEE 185\nC:\\edrive\\Irgee-old\\15-1-old\\irgee15-1.vp\nThursday, August 24, 2006 10:00:59\nColor profile: Disabled\nComposite  Default screen\n(Zhang & Foskett, 2003) and, if teachers respond by updating their models, they\nare likely to benefit from an increased repertoire of pedagogical knowledge.\nFinally, we can add a few words about the books from the point of view of the\nchildren. The books analysed were on the lists of the major educational\npublishers and represent a significant part of their output in primary school\ngeography. Many had been reprinted more than once, indicating that they were\nnot languishing in warehouses: this suggests that these books were available to\nchildren. There is evidence that the strength and number of clauses of cause and\npurpose determine the probability of comprehension and the recall of informa-\ntion read (Britton & Graesser, 1996). There were few such clauses in some of the\nbooks. Given that knowing why can also be satisfying and motivating, the diet\nthese books offered was a spartan one if they were used without supplement.\nEven some that provided reasons confined their attention mainly to explaining\nthe meaning of words. Some books, however, did seek to engage thought, asked\nfor and provided reasons to justify assertions, and offered learning activities.\nConclusion\nThere are primary school textbooks that could point a teacher towards\naddressing reasons and causal understandings in some aspects of geography.\nThese could help a teacher make good an inability to transform subject content\nknowledge into classroom discourse or make up for weaknesses in that knowl-\nedge. Care is needed, however, as textbooks are neither comprehensive nor\nuniform in their concern for reasoned understanding. Teachers need to be able to\ndistinguish between books that have this concern and those that do not and\nrecognise significant omissions. Given that many of these teachers will lack\nsubject knowledge or appropriate conceptions of geography, they may not be\nable to do this well without guidance or training. Textbook writers and\npublishers need to be aware that geography, even elementary geography, is not\nsimply descriptive. Further, they should be aware that reasons in some aspects of\ngeography, such as enquiry, seem to receive little attention.\nCorrespondence\nAny correspondence should be directed to Prof Lynn D.
