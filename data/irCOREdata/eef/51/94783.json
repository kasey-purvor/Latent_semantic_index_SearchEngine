This article \ninquires into these rhetorically grand claims, first noting the parallels with other processes of \nmediation (e.g. language, money, myths), second raising questions of value since, unlike for \nother forms of mediation, the media\u2019s role is typically construed as negative than positive and, \nthird observing that the difficulties of translating \u2018mediation\u2019 into a range of languages reveals \nsome conceptual confusions. As a step towards clarification, I contrast the terms \u2018mediation\u2019 \nand \u2018mediatization\u2019, these roughly, mapping onto situational and historical influences, \nconceived primarily at micro and macro levels of analysis respectively. I then argue for a \nbroad conception of mediation that encompasses those processes variously referred to as \nmediatization, mediazation or medialization. The analysis is illustrated by unpacking the \nclaim that \u2018childhood is mediated\u2019, before concluding that distinct aspects of the concept of \nmediation invite communication scholars to attend to the specific empirical, historical and \npolitical implications of the claim that \u2018everything is mediated\u2019. \n 1\nIntroduction \n\u201cNo part of the world, no human activity, is untouched by the new media. Societies \nworldwide are being reshaped, for better or for worse, by changes in the global media \nand information environment. So too are the everyday lives of their citizens. National \nand subnational forms of social, political and economic inclusion and exclusion are \nreconfigured by the increasing reliance on information and communication \ntechnologies in mediating almost every dimension of social life.\u201d \nThis is how Leah Lievrouw and I (2009) open our recent volume, Major Works in \nNew Media. Many in the field of media and communication have written such paragraphs. In \nthis article, I wish to halt the confident flow and ask, what do we mean by claiming that \ninformation and communication technologies now mediate every dimension of society? Is this \nparagraph merely introductory verbiage? Is it primarily rhetorical, designed to persuade the \ndoubters? Or does the focus on mediation mark a new theoretical direction? \nSuch a paragraph is grander, I suggest, than the kind of paragraph we used to write \nperhaps 20 or 30 years ago. So what\u2019s changed \u2013 both in the world, and in our conception of it? \nShould the title of this article have a question mark at the end? In unpacking claims about the \nsupposed mediation of everything, I have an additional purpose \u2013 to note how our field is \nchanging, adapting to encompass international and multilingual dialogue, an expanding array \nof media forms and institutions, and a repositioning of the scope for critique. \n \nA changing field \nConsider the changes in book titles. Several decades ago, typical book titles included \nMass Communication and Society, Mass Communication and Public Health, Television and \nthe Child, Television and the Public Sphere, Television and the Public, and so forth.1 The \nform was that of \u2018Mass Communication and\u2026\u2019 or \u2018Television and\u2026\u2019. Now we examine \n\u2018Mediated \u2026.\u2019, with the focus on the verb \u2013 as in Mediated Politics, The Mediation of Power, \nMediating the Nation, Mediating the Family, Mediating Culture, Mediated Sex.2 It seems that \nwe have moved from a social analysis in which the mass media comprise one among many \ninfluential but independent institutions whose relations with the media can be usefully \nanalyzed, to a social analysis in which everything is mediated, the consequence being that all \ninfluential institutions in society have themselves been transformed, reconstituted, by \ncontemporary processes of mediation. Castells (2000: 24) puts the case forcefully when he \nargues that, in the network society, \u2018political institutions are not the site of power any longer. \nThe real power is the power of instrumental flows, and cultural codes, embedded in \nnetworks.\u2019 \nAccording to the earlier model, media and communication studies would analyze the \nrelation between media and politics, say, while in other disciplines they analyze the relation \nbetween politics and the environment, or society and the family. But in a heavily mediated \nworld, one cannot analyze the relation between politics and the environment, or society and \nthe family without also recognizing the importance of the media \u2013 all these spheres and their \nintersections have become mediated. Thus, it has become commonplace to inquire, with \nThompson, into \u201cthe nature of self, experience and everyday life in a mediated world\u201d (1995: \n207).3 Or, noting what he called the \u201cmedia\u2019s intrusive ubiquity\u201d, Silverstone claimed that \n\u201cpolitics, like experience, can no longer even be thought outside a media frame\u201d (2005: 190-\n1). Or again, as Scannell (1988: 28) said grandly of national broadcasting systems, \u201ctheir \nprimary task is the mediation of modernity\u201d. \nThese are indeed grand claims we are making. And we make them in the face of some \napathy or even contradiction by others: society at large and university administrations in \nparticular do not always consider our field to be of such importance, and colleagues in \ndepartments of politics, sociology, psychology and economics seem to conduct their business \nwithout knocking on our doors too often or referring to our field. Hence the rhetorical intent \nof my opening paragraph, for we appear to have ambitions in media and communication not \n 2\nonly to defend our terrain but also to expand it into those traditionally held by other \ndisciplines. \n \nLost in translation \nBook titles are not enough to establish that our field is changing. Consider, further, a \ngrowing confusion over familiar terms along with a tendency to invent new ones \u2013 surely \nindications that ideas are changing. Some years ago, our associations, journals and \ndepartments renamed themselves \u2013 taking out \u2018mass communication\u2019 and rebranding \nthemselves \u2018media and communication\u2019, or similar. Moreover, new concepts are emerging: \n\u2018mediation\u2019, \u2018mediatization\u2019, \u2018medialisation\u2019, \u2018mediazation\u2019, \u2018remediation\u2019, the \u2018mediatic turn\u2019, \nand so forth. \nThese terminological issues have several sources. For some, they reflect an attempt to \nrethink questions of media power in terms of richly contextualized processes that reject \nnarrowly linear assumptions about media effects or impacts (for a critique of the 'transmission \nmodel' of communication, see Carey, 1989). For others, what\u2019s changing is not so much \ntheory as technology - the advent of new media and the remediation of old media and, indeed, \nof face-to-face communication. Thus in their classic article on \u2018mediated interpersonal \ncommunication\u2019, Cathcart and Gumpert (1983: 271) use \u2018mediation\u2019 to refer to the \nincreasingly pervasive technological intermediaries that have \u2018been interposed to transcend \nthe limitations of time and space\u2019. Not only does \u2018mediation\u2019 allow us to avoid tying down the \nfocus to specific media (radio, press, television, etc), useful in convergence culture (Jenkins, \n2006), but more fundamentally it recognizes that social and technological changes are \ntransforming the dual centerpiece of the communication field \u2013 mass communication and \ninterpersonal (or face-to-face) communication \u2013 resulting in diversifying and hybridizing \nprocesses of mediated communication (see Anderson & Meyer, 1988, for an influential early \nstatement, and Cardoso, 2008, for a contemporary analysis). \nBut new terms are also emerging because communication studies are increasingly \nengaged in a global \u2013 and therefore multilingual \u2013 dialogue.4 In English, \u2018mediation\u2019 has been \n\u2018repurposed\u2019, away from the old meaning of conciliation towards an emphasis on the media, \nas enabled by the fortunate coincidence in the terms for linking disparate elements and for the \nmedia of communication. Though this is not a coincidence, of course, it is nonetheless a \ncoincidence that does not occur in all languages. For example, my Slovenian colleague \nreports that it is difficult to translate the concept of mediation: it translates literally as the verb, \nposredovanje, posredovati (to mediate, to intervene) but this bears no relation to media and \ncommunication. My Polish colleague agrees \u2013 it\u2019s a judicial term, no more, no less. Or, as a \nTibetan student pointed out in my lecture recently, the mediator is the matchmaker in his \nvillage. Meanwhile, to my Icelandic colleague, mediation translates as midlun, meaning to \nconvey or share information with others, but as he reminded me, it is related to midill \n(medium), used both for mass media and for a person who can communicate with the dead. \nIn Portugese, media\u00e7\u00e3o is used as an academic term for the negotiation of media \nmeanings between producers and consumers; although this is not an everyday usage, nor is \nour use of the term in English. Further, while my Bulgarian colleague regards mediation as a \nlegal term for dispute resolution, she also recognises the term for mediatization as publicizing \nor representing an issue in the media. Yet my Estonian colleague noted with some asperity, \nthat for a non-English speaker, mediation or mediatization makes little difference. My French \ncolleague had the least to say on the subject \u2013 in French, mediation is m\u00e9diation. But my \nGerman colleagues had much to say on the subject, and their debates are influencing those in \nScandinavian countries also. Indeed, in the Germanic languages, while mediation \n(Vermittlung) ordinarily references the legal\/regulatory term for seeking discursive solutions \nto disputes, Mediatisierung (mediatization) and Medialisierung (medialisation) refer to the \nmeta process by which everyday practices and social relations are increasingly shaped by \nmediating technologies and media organizations. \n 3\nBeyond semantic confusion \nI am no linguist, but I discern three patterns here. First, in some languages, conceptual \nterms used in English are puzzling or incomprehensible. To be sure, the concepts have their \nequivalents, but we must take care when promoting international dialogue to attend to matters \nof translation in both directions, or else we shall become \u2018lost in translation\u2019. Working with \ncolleagues internationally has taught me that subtle attempts to prescribe exactly what \nconcepts should mean is a doomed effort, as ordinary language meanings will reassert \nthemselves and confusion will result. Perhaps this is what led McQuail (2006: 115) to title his \nrecent review article, \u2018On the mediatization of war\u2019. In this, he uses the term as a catch all for \nthe multiple ways in which practices of media and war are becoming interlinked, noting what \nhe sees as a failure to establish clearly theorized and empirically supported \u201cchains of \nreasoning\u201d regarding the influence of media on war and\/or vice versa. His frustration hints at \na common response to these terms, often shared by my students, namely that they obfuscate \nwhat, surely, should be clear arguments about relations of power. \nSecond, my brief linguistic review suggests that ordinary language prioritizes the \nnotion of mediation as getting in between, negotiating or resolving disputes. Often this is \nmeant positively \u2013 mediation means generating mutual understanding and agreement where \nbefore there was conflict. Whether the mediator creates marriages or alleviates the pain of \ndivorce, society generally values this role. But, in our academic use in English language \nmedia and communication research, we generally reverse this valuation. Undoubtedly, there \nare times when we celebrate the ways in which individuals use media creatively, contra the \nexpectations of major providers, and when we welcome the ways in which media connect \nindividuals across the globe, transcending the parochial constraints of face-to-face \ncommunication; on such occasions, we see the media\u2019s role in mediating as change for the \nbetter. But more often, we ask who controls these media institutions, whether global \ncorporation or the state, and we critically observe how mediated communication is \nsubordinated to, shaped by, the inexorable logic of global capitalism - commodification, \nstandardization, privatization, co-option, surveillance, and the rest; on these occasions, we see \nthe media\u2019s role as instituting change for the worse. For example, Thompson (1995: 213) \nobserves four negative consequences for the self of what he terms \u2018mediazation\u2019: \n\u2018(1) the mediated intrusion of ideological messages; (2) the double-bind of mediated \ndependency; (3) the disorienting effect of symbolic overload; and (4) the absorption \nof the self in mediated quasi-interaction\u2019. \nAt the heart of this claim about \u2018getting in between\u2019 is the Hegelian argument that \nthere is no pure experience prior to mediation (for a contemporary statement, see Waite, 2003). \nHence, yes, everything is mediated; my title needs no question mark. Gergen notes the long \ntradition of argument that \u2018Language comes into being \u2013 into meaning \u2013 through coordinated \nrelationships among persons. It is through language that persons acquire their ways of \nunderstanding the world and themselves\u2019 (2002: 228). So, when Silverstone (2005: 188) \nobserved that language is the paradigm case of mediation, as a precursor to making a case for \nhow the media mediate, he deliberately drew a strong analogy. Paraphrasing Gergen, then, we \ncan claim that, as for language, today\u2019s media become meaningful because of coordinated \nhuman activity and, at the same time, people understand the world and their position in it \nthrough the media. Mediation works both ways. \nOn this view, we need media and communication research to understand how the \nmedia mediate, for the same reason that we need linguistics to understand how language \nmediates, economics to understand how money mediates, literature to understand how \nnarratives and myths mediate, and consumption studies to understand material goods mediate. \nLike those disciplines too perhaps, we are interested in the processes of mediation primarily \nbecause they reveal the changing relations among social structures and agents rather than \nbecause they tell us about \u2018the media\u2019 per se. Indeed, contrary to the periodic \nmisunderstandings of our colleagues in the \u2018-Ology\u2019 Faculty, who suppose us only interested \nin the ad hoc and transient collection of technologies that mediate these fundamental themes \n 4\n(television, mobile, internet, games, networks, etc), in the rather broad Faculty of \u2018Mediation\u2019 \nthat I have sketched here, the purpose of the Media and Communication Department is to \nunderstand the specific relation of modern media to questions of faculty-wide concern \nregarding democracy, culture, society, communication, identity, inequality and power. \n \nMediation and mediatization \nThe third conclusion I draw from the linguistic muddle noted earlier is signaled by the \nfact that media and communication departments are, generally, the newest entrant in this \nfaculty. The Germanic tradition favors \u2018mediatization\u2019 as a historical argument distinguishable \nfrom that which links media and mediation in everyday communicative situations (see \nLundby, 2008). Krotz (2008) identifies mediatization as one of the four fundamental meta-\nprocesses that have shaped, and continue to shape, modernity - along with globalization, \nindividualization and, especially, commercialization (for an overview of debates surrounding \nthese meta-processes, see Beck, Giddens, & Lash, 1995). Krotz explains: \n\u2018By mediatization we mean the historical developments that took and take place as a \nresult of change in (communication) media and the consequences of those changes.\u2019 \n(2008: 23) \nHe adds carefully, so as not to imply a technological determinism (Mackenzie & Wajcman, \n1999), that although mediatization changes human communication by offering new \npossibilities of communication to individuals, economies, societies, and cultures, this process \n\u2018is a man-made one\u2019 (p. 23). \nI was somewhat puzzled by the term \u2018mediatization\u2019 \u2013 a clumsy neologism in \nEnglish \u2013 until I learned of the German Laws of Mediatization in the early nineteenth century, \nwhen the states of the Holy Roman Empire were \u2018mediatized\u2019 by Napoleon.5 In brief, \nNapoleon interposed between the miscellany of independent cities, the princes and the \narchbishops who previously answered only to the Emperor an intermediate level of territorial \nauthorities. As Wikipedia explains: \n\u2018Mediatization, defined broadly, is the subsumation of one monarchy into another \nmonarchy in such a way that the ruler of the annexed state keeps his or her sovereign \ntitle and, sometimes, a measure of local power.\u20196\nOne may think this has nothing to do with the media, only with the notion of \nmediation as getting in between distinct and possibly conflictual participants. But today, the \nmedia not only get between any and all participants in society but also, crucially, annex a \nsizeable part of their power by mediatizing \u2013 subordinating - the previously-powerful \nauthorities of government, education, the church, the family, etc. History, including the \nhistory of media, assumes a development from non-mediated to mediated. Consider \nHjarvard\u2019s (2008: 13) definition of mediatization:  \n\u2018In earlier societies, social institutions like family, school and church were the most \nimportant providers of information, tradition and moral orientation for the individual \nmember of society. Today, these institutions have lost some of their former authority, \nand the media have to some extent taken over their role as providers of information \nand moral orientation, at the same time as the media have become society\u2019s most \nimportant storyteller about society itself.\u2019 \nThe parallels between the two notions of mediatization are convincing - it seems we \nare telling a two hundred year history here, from Napoleon to Rupert Murdoch. However, \nnotwithstanding the power of Murdoch and his fellow media moguls, it is the case that for \nmediatization theorists, the question mark should go back onto my title. The question of how \nfar the power of traditional authorities has in fact been annexed by the media is an empirical \none as yet unresolved. Writing on politics, Mazzoleni & Schulz (1999: 247) suggest that this \nis only partial, arguing that, \u2018the best description of the current situation is \u201cmediatization\u201d, \nwhere political institutions increasingly are dependent on and shaped by mass media but \n 5\nnevertheless remain in control of political processes and functions\u2019 (see also Kepplinger, \n2002). In short, establishing the degree, nature and consequences of the mediatization of \nanything or everything - politics, education, family, religion, self - is a task still largely ahead \nof us.7\nWhile our understanding of mediatization is an incomplete and still unfolding \nhistorical project, mediation \u2013 as defined by Hjarvard, Krotz et al \u2013 is construed as of doubtful \nsignificance. In stressing that \u2018mediatization is not to be mistaken for the common \nphenomenon of mediation\u2019, Hjarvard (2008: 14) cautions that \u2018mediation in itself may not \nhave any profound impact on social institutions\u2019. Similarly, while Krotz (2008: 17) agrees \nwith mediation theorists that \u2018humans are beings who exist in and depend on interaction, \ncommunication, and social relations\u2019, he evinces little conviction that the reverse occurs, \nnamely that human actions transform communication, especially insofar as this may have \nconsequences beyond the lifeworld. It seems, therefore, that mediatization theorists do not \nexpect to have to look to daily processes of mediation to explain constraints on or unexpected \nfindings regarding the process of mediatization. \nHowever, rather than polarizing these or related terms (Couldry, 2008), I suggest that \nin this semantic seeking after new formulations, scholars are selecting different starting points \nto reach the assertion of not one but two grand claims are being made: first, the media mediate, \nentering into and shaping the mundane but ubiquitous relations among individuals and \nbetween individuals and society; and second, as a result, the media mediate, for better or for \nworse, more than ever before. Writing in English, I prefer to conceive both these claims as \ncentral to the theory of mediation8 for this permits us not only to examine the empirical \nsupport for each claims but, more especially, to recognize their mutual relations and \ninterdependencies. \n \nAn illustration \u2013 the case of \u2018mediated childhood\u2019 \nLet me illustrate these arguments and interconnections with some empirical research. \nOnce, writing on the notion of \u2018mediated childhoods\u2019 (Livingstone, 1998b: 436), I began with \nan empirical observation as follows: \n\u2018Two eight year old boys play their favourite multimedia adventure game on the \nfamily PC. When they discover an Internet site where the same game could be played \ninteractively with unknown others, this occasions great excitement in the household. \nThe boys choose their fantasy personae, and try diverse strategies to play the game, \nboth cooperative and competitive, simultaneously 'talking' on-line (i.e. writing) to the \nother participants. But when restricted in their access to the Internet, for reasons of \ncost, the game spins off into 'real life'. Now the boys, together with their younger \nsisters, choose a character, don their battle dress and play 'the game' all over the house, \ngoing downstairs to Hell, The Volcanoes and The Labyrinth, and upstairs to The Town, \n\u2018improving\u2019 the game in the process. This new game is called, confusingly for adult \nobservers, \u201cplaying the Internet\u201d.\u2019 \nWhat did I mean by mediation, in this context? First and most obviously, that the \nmedia have entered into the close relationship between children and their play. Contrary to the \nmany sociologists and psychologists of childhood who leave media, television, internet etc. \nout of their book contents, even out of the index, childhood is mediated. Second, the parties to \nthis interaction cannot be understood independently. Rather, there is a mutual re-negotiation \nof meaning \u2013 nonlinear, unpredictable - that alters the children, their play and the cultural \nmeaning of the game itself. The media do not simply add a new element to the story, they \ntransform it. Third, this process is both subtle and easily taken-for granted \u2013 the involvement \nof the media could easily be overlooked by a casual observer. The analysis of mediation, \ntherefore, invites what Radway called a \u2018radical contextualism\u2019 to encompass \u2018the \nkaleidoscope of daily life\u2019 (1988: 366) and so recognize the horizontal and historical \nconnections within and across the expanding array of mass and new media in people\u2019s \n 6\ncommunication environments. \nFocusing on mediatization as \u2018the growing media presence in identity constructions\u2019, \nsince \u2018culture is more and more dependent on communication media\u2019, Fornas (1995: 210) \nsimilarly links the emerging digital hermeutics of new media users with earlier analyses of \nmass media audiences by claiming that \u2018our communication society is based on mediations \nbetween texts and people, in that people pass and meet each other through texts, just as texts \npass and encounter each other through people\u2019 (p. 104). Fornas is here, I think, influenced by \nthe German reception theorist, Iser (1980: 106), who said, in a statement that influenced a \ngeneration of audience theorists, \n\u2018The work itself cannot be identical with the text or with its actualization but must be \nsituated somewhere between the two. It must inevitably be virtual in character, as it \ncannot be reduced to the reality of the text or to the subjectivity of the reader, and it is \nfrom this virtuality that it derives its dynamism. As the reader passes through the \nvarious perspectives offered by the text, and relates the different views and patterns to \none another, he sets the work in motion, and so sets himself in motion too.\u2019 \nWe must be quick-footed to grasp these processes, especially since, as Ang notes, \nradical contextualism points to \u2018the impossibility of determining any social or textual meaning \noutside of the complex situation in which it is produced\u2019, this making it \u2018difficult to imagine \nwhere to begin and where to end the analysis\u2019 (1996: 253). \nFourth, in pointing to the mediation of childhood I also meant to claim that, through \nsuch slight but ubiquitous moments of mediation, a historical shift in childhood is effected \u2013 \ntowards individualization, commercialization, globalization and, if you will, mediatization \n(Krotz, 2008).9 To sustain this last, perhaps more tenuous claim, other kinds of evidence \u2013 \nespecially the political economy of the game\u2019s production, and the longer history of children\u2019s \nplay, must be considered. To illustrate this, consider the following. \nHeller (2008) writes about how children\u2019s board game Monopoly was popular in pre-\nCommunist Hungary (called Capitaly) but then rejected for purveying capitalist propaganda \nand reinvented in a socialist form in the 1960s (as Gazdalkodj okosan! \u2013 Economize wisely!). \nPlayers visited good socialist institutions, free because of their pedagogic value (the national \ngallery, zoo, sports) or pay a lot for the places with negative morals (pub, tobacconist, \nnightclub) \u2013 the aim was to acquire a block flat with basic equipment while saving in the state \nbank. But mediation, as ever, worked both ways. The socialist version achieved some \npopularity, but Capitaly survived and was secretly circulated among friends and, in addition, \nhandmade versions of Monopoly were created as samizdat toys. Meanwhile, in the West, \ncritics of capitalism were promoting the opposite values (e.g. the French game, Anti-\nMonopoly). Clearly, values are mediated through all media, including children\u2019s toys, and we \nneed to pay attention to the often unstated processes by which struggles over power occur in \neveryday life. \nA contemporary version of these struggles emerged also from my recent work on \nteenagers\u2019 use of social networking sites. In this, I show both the creative ways in which \nteenagers express their developing identities, strongly shaped by social determinations (the \npeer group, life style expectations, gender norms, privacy from parents, etc) and how these \ndovetail with, are constrained by or even rendered problematic by the affordances of the sites \nthemselves (Hutchby, 2001). In the case of social networking sites, these affordances \n(arguably framed by specific media logics) insist on highly standardized formats for identity \nexpression, and their design features \u2013 for example, regarding privacy \u2013 appear somewhat \n\u2018illegible\u2019 to teenagers (Livingstone, 2008b). In short, the intersection of youthful literacies \nand technological affordances is resulting in the mediation of identity and social relationships. \nThis is also a story of historical change \u2013 of the increasing mediation (i.e. the mediatization) \nof identity-related experiences once conducted, for free, in the bedroom or on the street corner. \nThe commodification of routine daily interactions has been recently brought into sharp relief \nby the guerrilla action on the part of Facebook users to protect their privacy and data, along \n 7\nwith struggles over children\u2019s privacy between parent groups and sites such as MySpace. \nThe field of children, youth and media is just one case among many in which \nidentifying the historical, value-laden shifts is becoming a crucial focus for scholars hitherto \nprimarily attentive to the micro (perhaps overly universalized) processes of the here and now. \nSome ambitious projects are underway. For example, Buckingham, Scanlon & Sefton-Green \n(2001) links their analysis of how children learn in expected and unexpected ways using \nedutainment games to the marketing strategies of the games business in \u2018selling edutainment\u2019 \nto parents and teachers. Reid-Walsh (2008) explores how the commercial intent behind the \nproduction of The Sims translates into design features that are then reshaped by the playful \npractices of the children gleefully find new ways to murder their Sims. Jenkins (2003) seeks \nto disentangle where the power lies in the ongoing dynamic of co-option and evasion between \nLucas Entertainment Ltd. and the writers of Star Wars fanzines. \nEach of these and related projects can be framed as examining the mutual shaping of \nmicro and macro processes so as to elaborate a dynamic, nonlinear circuit of meaning (Hall, \n1999) - an approach to mediation being developed in relation to civic communication \n(Dahlgren, 2003), new media uses (e.g. du Gay, Hall, Janes & Mackay, 1997) and other \ndomains of research. Thus Thompson (1995: 46) calls for an analysis of \u2018the overall \ncumulative impact on social life of the existence of media institutions and their involvement \nin the circulation of symbols\u2019, an analysis which Davis (2007) calls an \u2018inverted political \neconomy\u2019. The elements of the circuit may be more or less elaborated but, in a complex \nmedia and information environment, they require at the least a reformulation of the traditional \nmass communication model of producer\/ text\/ audience to include three elements of new \nmedia infrastructure: \n\u2018The artefacts or devices used to communicate or convey information; the activities \nand practices in which people engage to communicate or share information; and the \nsocial arrangements or organizational forms that develop around those devices and \npractices.\u2019 (Lievrouw & Livingstone, 2006: 2).10\n \nMacro and micro \nIn part, the above debates can be understood heuristically in terms of the relation \nbetween macro and micro levels of analysis, a perennial theme in the field of communication \nas in the social sciences generally. At stake, it seems, is less whether or not everything is \nmediated (for this is an interesting but relatively uncontested empirical question) but rather, \nwhether this matters \u2013 in other words, whether the mediation of micro processes of social \ninteraction influences macro-historical shifts in institutional relations of power. Alexander & \nGiesen (1987: 14) outline five approaches to the macro-micro link: \n\u2018(1) rational, purposeful individuals create society through contingent acts of freedom; \n(2) interpretive individuals create society through contingent acts of freedom; (3) \nsocialized individuals re-create society as a collective force through contingent acts of \nfreedom; (4) socialized individuals reproduce society by translating existing social \nenvironment into the microrealm; and (5) rational, purposeful individuals acquiesce \nto society because they are forced to by external, social control.\u2019 \nAlthough it may initially seem that mediation concerns the micro and mediatization the macro, \nmost communication scholars eschew the extremes of the first and last approaches, centering \ndebate instead on the differences among the middle three - roughly, social constructionism, \nstructuration and socialization - approaches (Livingstone, 1998a). While mediation theorists \ncan at times seem solely focused on what Tomlinson (1991: 61) terms \u2018a subtle interplay of \nmediations \u2026 the constant mediation of one aspect of cultural experience by another\u2019 in their \nexploration of the texture of everyday life (a focus of little appeal to mediatization theorists \nconcerned instead with the increasing power of media institutions11), mediation theorists are \nultimately also concerned with historical shifts in power.12 This is most evident in the \ncommon but important claim that, through a mutual dialectic between the actions of the major \n 8\npower players and the numerous tactical acts of interpretation and\/or resistance among the \nwider public (Giddens, 1984), key cultural distinctions are becoming blurred or reconfigured \nprecisely because they are increasingly mediated: these include \u2018public\u2019\/ \u2018private\u2019 (Meyrowitz, \n1985), \u2018self\u2019\/ \u2018other\u2019 (Chouliaraki, 2008), \u2018nature\u2019\/ \u2018society\u2019 (Haraway, 1991), \u2018masculine\u2019\/ \n\u2018feminine\u2019 (Wajcman, 2004), \u2018local\u2019\/ \u2018global\u2019 (Tomlinson, 1991). \n These are very abstract claims, however, partly because the macro level of the \nanalysis is often left undeveloped. Here the mediatization theorists are stronger. Schulz (2004) \nechoes Innis (1951) in arguing that developments in technology permit the media to bridge \ntime-space distances in particular ways, that semiotic potentialities encode the world in \nparticular ways, and that the economic underpinning of media systems then ensures the \nstandardization (or commodification) of these bridging and encoding activities. He argues that \nfour kinds of social\/historical transformation follow, resulting in \u2018problematic dependencies, \nconstraints and exaggerations\u2019 (p. 87): \n\u2018First, the media extend the natural limits of human communication capacities; \nsecond, the media substitute social activities and social institutions; third, media \namalgamate with various non-media activities in social life; and fourth, the actors and \norganizations of all sectors of society accommodate to the media logic.\u2019 (p. 98) \nThis reference to the notion of media logic takes us back to Altheide & Snow\u2019s (1979: \n16) examination of \u2018entertainment, news, politics, religion, and sports as institutions in \nAmerican society that have adopted a media logic and specific media formats as their own \ninstitutional strategies and thus have become part of the total media culture.\u2019 Where Altheide \n& Snow thought of media logic in terms of the standardization of media grammars and \ncontent formats (in turn shaped by institutional, economic and regulatory factors), other logics \nhave also been identified (e.g. tracing the media's influence in reshaping politics, geography \nand religion: Corner & Pels, 2003; Gunkel & Gunkel, 1997; Hjarvard, 2008). As noted at the \noutset, rarely if ever are such logics, however plural and changing, regarded positively. In this, \nmany scholars follow Habermas (1981\/7), whose social theory holds that, as the system world \nand lifeworld become uncoupled over modernity, processes of mediation are no longer \nanchored in the lifeworld but are, rather, increasingly colonized by the system world.13 Thus, \n\u2018the colonization of the lifeworld represents domination and control by instrumental rather \nthan communicative rationality\u2019 (Joseph, 2003: 159). Habermas explains, using the Germanic \n(i.e. Napoleonic rather than media studies) notion of mediatization, that: \n\u2018[A] progressively rationalized lifeworld is both uncoupled from and made dependent \nupon increasingly complex, formally organized domains of action, like the economy \nand the state administration. This dependency [results] from the mediatization of the \nlifeworld by system imperatives.\u2019 (1981\/7: 305) \nWhile even Habermas is not always so pessimistic (see Habermas, 1996), it is undoubtedly \nthe case that mediation theorists more closely involved with the micro level of analysis evince \nmore excitement and optimism regarding the growing importance of processes of mediation, \nas with the example of children\u2019s mediated play, than a critical\/macro approach implies. In \nthis regard, different readers will prefer different standpoints.14\n \nConclusion - clarity through keywords \nIn conclusion, let me return to the critical ambitions of our work. Williams (1983: 204-7) \ntraces \u2018mediation\u2019 back to the 14th century shift from pre-modern to modern society, noting \nthree central meanings: \n\u2018(i) acting as an intermediary (e.g. the political act of reconciling adversaries); \n\u2018(ii) intermediate (indirect) agency between otherwise separated parties to a relationship; and \n\u2018(iii) a formal way of directly expressing otherwise unexpressed relations.\u2019 \nIn short - reconciling two opponents, bridging over distance, stating the unstated. All \n 9\nverbs, processes. Each meaning is already captured, it might be said, in the notion of \n\u2018communication\u2019 (Hjarvard, 2008; Silverstone, 2005) but \u2018mediation\u2019, as an alternative, \nusefully highlights the artefacts and practices used to communicate, it more readily invites \nanalysis of the social and organizational arrangements through which mediation is instituted \n(i.e. the micro and macro conditions in which otherwise separated parties become interrelated \nin Williams\u2019 quote), and it urges a critical focus on the expression of what is unexpressed or \nsuppressed in those interrelations. \nSome in the field of media and communication give mediation a strong theoretical \nframe, following the first sense and stressing the process of negotiation, especially among \ncritical theorists who analyze how media enter the power struggles between dominant and \nsubaltern groups in society. Martin-Barbero (2003) argues that scholars should attend to \nmediations (plural) as the cultural processes by which power is negotiated between dominant \ninstitutions and popular or resistant movements. \nOthers use mediation less strongly, in Williams\u2019 second sense, to point to how the \nmedia overcome (or transform) distance, both physical and symbolic, time and space, and so \nconnect otherwise separated parties \u2013 e.g. peoples separated by continents, politicians \nseparated from their publics \u2013 an enterprise that has ethical as well as political significance \n(Chouliaraki, 2008). Relatedly, the term serves to bridge formerly distinct spheres of inquiry \ninto mass and interpersonal communication so as to recognize emerging and hybrid forms of \nmediated communication. \nFollowing the tradition of critical theory, Williams also argued that mediation works \nto disguise or deflect from social conflict, while making the work of mediation unnoticed, \nnaturalized. Methodologically, this brings into play his third meaning of mediation, it being \nthe critic\u2019s task to reject the \u2018persuasive physical metaphor\u2019 that art (or media) simply reflects \nreality, and instead to reveal \u2018the social and material character of artistic activity\u2019 (Williams, \n1977: 97), thus clarifying otherwise unexpressed relations of power.15 Whatever our politics \nregarding these relations of power and whether or not we seek to contest them, the enterprise \nof revealing the ways in which their operation is mediated indeed seems an appropriate \nambition for those who believe media and communications to be ever more crucial in today\u2019s \nworld \u2013 in short, for those who seek to explore the possible and actual mediation of \neverything. \n \nAcknowledgements \nAn earlier version of this article was presented as the Presidential Address to the Annual \nConference of the International Communication Association in Montreal, May 2008.

See Livingstone (2005) for a parallel debate over the translation of \u2018audience\u2019 \nand \u2018public\u2019 and Livingstone (2008a) for difficulties in translating \u2018literacy\u2019 and \u2018media literacy\u2019. \n5 Thanks to Rodney Livingstone for drawing this to my attention. \n6 See http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mediatization. Last accessed on 25 August 2008.  \n7 Note that this leaves open for future research the question of whether, for example, the spheres of \npolitics, health, sociality or family are all being mediatized to a greater or lesser extent, and in similar \nor different ways. \n8 Does it matter if we label the latter process, 'mediatization' or instead, simply, examine 'the growing \npower of the media' or the historical 'transformation' of the role of the media in mediating social \nprocesses or institutions of one kind or another? \n9 Generally, it is my intention to position \u2018mediation\u2019 as the broader term, encompassing in ordinary \nlanguage the historical\/macro processes specifically intended by advocates of the term \u2018mediatization\u2019 \nbut, in such a list of abstract processes (or -izations), \u2018mediatization\u2019 is useful. \n10 In this formulation, we draw on Star & Bowker\u2019s (2002) concept of infrastructure. Note that such an \ninterweaving of the cultural and the economic, the tactics of the everyday and the grand sweep of \nhistory, demands that we become collectively, if not individually, highly skilled in multiple approaches \nand methods (Meyrowitz, 2008). \n11 Which is not to say that mediatization theorists are wholly unconcerned with questions of experience \nand semiosis in the lifeworld (e.g. Krotz, 2008). \n12 It is true that, for example in Silverstone\u2019s (2005) otherwise convincing appeal to join the cultural, \nprocessual turn, he says little about institutions or matters of political economy, instead focusing on \ntactical acts of resistance, oppositional interpretations and unintended consequences. But it could \nhardly be claimed that mediation theorists are unconcerned with the power inequalities that \ndifferentially constrain or enable people\u2019s actions, including in relation to the media (e.g. Couldry, \n2000). \n13 Outhwaite (1996: 369) defines Habermas\u2019 notion of \u2018lifeworld\u2019 as encompassing \u2018relatively informal \nways of life, contrasted with market and administrative systems.\u2019 \n14 There are echoes, here, of the long-standing debate between political economy and cultural studies \nperspectives, among other defining dichotomies of our field. \n15 Yet Williams (1977: 100) remained dissatisfied with the notion of mediation, noting that mediation, \nlike reflection, still assumes a fundamental and problematic distinction between (rather than mutually \nconstitutive relation between) the representation and that which is represented. \n \n 14\n"}
