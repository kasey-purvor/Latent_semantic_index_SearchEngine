INTRODUCTION\nTo understand fully the scattering of composite nuclei,\nconsisting of A nucleons, from a structureless target such as a\nsingle proton, one ideally needs to solve the A + 1 scattering\nproblem. Fortunately, for many nuclei, and halo nuclei in\nparticular, this may not be necessary because such systems\ncan be very well-described within a few-body picture of n\nconstituents (where n < A). The strongly correlated n bodies\ncan be individual nucleons or clusters of nucleons where each\ncluster is itself treated as a structureless, though not necessarily\ninert, body. Thus the scattering problem to be solved is a\nmore manageable but nevertheless challenging (n + 1)-body\none.\nThe ground-state wave function for the bound n-body\nsystem (where here n is typically 2, for the deuteron or 11Be, or\n3 for the Borromean nuclei 6He and 11Li) can be described via\napproximate solutions to the time-independent Schro\u00a8dinger\nequation. This is then used as one of the ingredients, along with\nthe optical potentials between each of the n constituents and\nthe target, entering the fully (n + 1)-body scattering problem.\nIt is the aim of microscopic scattering theory to construct the\ntotal scattering amplitude in terms of well-defined dynamical\nand structural quantities. The many-body scattering frame-\nwork is, however, a nontrivial one to deal with. Therefore,\napproximation schemes have been developed such as the\ncontinuum discretized coupled-channels (CDCC) method [1].\nIn this approach the (N + 1)-body Schro\u00a8dinger equation is\napproximated as a set of effective two-body coupled-channel\nequations, which take into account bound as well as continuum\nstates (something found to be of great importance when dealing\nwith the scattering of weakly bound systems). However, this\nmethod is nontrivial to implement numerically and for the\nhigh scattering energies available at today\u2019s fragmentation\n*Electronic address: j.al-khalili@surrey.ac.uk\n\u2020Electronic address: raquel.crespo@tagus.ist.utl.pt\n\u2021Electronic address: moro@us.es\nfacilities it becomes more practical to use a multiple-scattering\nexpansion of the total transition amplitude (MST) [2\u20138].\nIn the MST approach the projectile-target transition ampli-\ntude is expanded in terms of off-shell transition amplitudes\nfor projectile constituent-target subsystem scattering. Due to\nthe complexity of the many-body operator suitable approxima-\ntions need to be made to express in a convenient way the overall\nscattering amplitude in terms of these subsystem amplitudes.\nThe MST approach therefore provides a clear and transparent\ninterpretation of the composite system in terms of the free\nscattering of its constituents and is numerically advantageous.\nAt the high energies and weak binding of the projectiles of\ninterest here the expansion is expected to converge rapidly.\nIn this article, we use this framework to calculate the elastic\nscattering of the halo nucleus 6He from a proton target at\n717 MeV\/nucleon where new experimental data are now\navailable. However, the momentum transfers covered by the\ndata still essentially probe only the part of the few-body\ndynamics of the halo system that is constrained by the rms\nmatter radius. Thus a treatment of 6He as a three-body\nsystem of \u03b1-particle core plus two valence neutrons is quite\nappropriate. We outline and compare three quite different ap-\nproaches to evaluating the MST multiple-scattering expansion\nto show the validity of the different models and the importance\nof higher-order terms in the MST series. Specifically, we\nexamine (i) the factorized impulse approximation (FIA);\n(ii) the fixed scatterer, or adiabatic, approximation (FSA);\nand (iii) the Glauber approximation [9,10]. The first two\nmethods (described in detail in Ref. [8]), although making\nfewer simplifying assumptions than the Glauber model, are\nused here only to calculate the single-scattering terms of\nthe full amplitude, whereas the Glauber approach includes\nhigher-order terms. However, higher-order terms have been\nused elsewhere [5]. We first compare all three approaches at\nthe single-scattering level and then include the higher order\nterms within the Glauber framework and compare with the\nexperimental data. In all cases we use the same three-body\n6He ground-state wave function and similar amplitudes for the\n\u03b1 \u2212 p and n \u2212 p subsystem scattering.\n0556-2813\/2007\/75(2)\/024608(6) 024608-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nAL-KHALILI, CRESPO, JOHNSON, MORO, AND THOMPSON PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 024608 (2007)\nII. THE MULTIPLE-SCATTERING EXPANSION OF THE\nTOTAL TRANSITION AMPLITUDE\nWe consider the scattering of a projectile (labeled p) from\na few-body target consisting of n subsystems weakly bound\nto each other (an n + 1 scattering problem). We refer to the\ncomposite system as the target although in practice many such\nscattering problems are carried out in inverse kinematics due\nto the short lifetime of the n-cluster system, requiring it in\npractice to be used as the projectile (such as the case of 6He + p\nscattering investigated in Sec. VI). The n constituents of the\ntarget can themselves be either individual nucleons or clusters\nof nucleons. The total transition operator for the scattering is\nT = V + VG0T =\nn\u2211\ni=1\nvi +\nn\u2211\ni=1\nviG0T , (1)\nwhere vi is the interaction between the projectile and the ith\nconstituent of the target and G0 is the free Green\u2019s operator\n(propagator) in the sense that it does not contain the projectile-\ntarget interactions\nG0 = (E + i\u0002 \u2212 Kp \u2212 H0)\u22121, (2)\nwhere E is the total energy in the center-of-mass (c.m.)\nframe, Kp is the operator for the total kinetic energy of\nthe projectile and target in the overall c.m. system, and H0\nthe internal Hamiltonian of the n-body target. Within the\nmultiple-scattering expansion of the total transition operator,\none defines a projectile-ith constituent transition operator\n\u03c4i as\n\u03c4i = vi + viG0\u03c4i, (3)\nwhere it is noted here that \u03c4i is not a two-body operator as it\ndepends on the propagator G0, which is a many-body operator.\nEquation (1) can then be written\nT =\nn\u2211\ni=1\nTi, (4)\nwhere Ti satisfies\nTi = \u03c4i + \u03c4iG0\n\u2211\nj \u0001=i\nTj = \u03c4i + \u03c4iG0\n\u2211\nj \u0001=i\n\u03c4j + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (5)\nand thus\nT =\n\u2211\ni\n\u03c4i +\n\u2211\ni\n\u03c4iG0\n\u2211\nj \u0001=i\n\u03c4j + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (6)\nIn the limit when the target nucleus subsystems are weakly\nbound to each other, the multiple-scattering expansion to the\nP-T transition amplitude is expected to converge rapidly [3,4]\nand the multiple-scattering expansion Eq. (6) is useful. Often,\nthe series in Eq. (6) is truncated and only the first term is\nretained, amounting to what is known as the single-scattering\napproximation, in which the projectile can scatter from each\ntarget constituent separately (to all orders in their interaction)\nbut does not then proceed to scatter from any of the other\nconstituents. Here, we retain higher-order terms in Eq. (6)\nbut, instead, make a less drastic simplifying assumption:\nwe retain only forward-scattering (FS) terms in the series.\nThat is, once the projectile has scattered from constituent\ni and moves on to constituent j it does not then return to\nconstituent i because this would involve backscattering. With\nthis assumption therefore\u2014assumed valid at higher scattering\nenergies\u2014we see that Eq. (6) truncates naturally at the nth\norder. Thus for a two-body target (n = 2), for instance, we\nwould have\nT(n=2) = \u03c41 + \u03c42 + \u03c41G0\u03c42 + \u03c42G0\u03c41, (7)\nand for a three-body target (n = 3) we would have\nT(n=3) =\n3\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c4i +\n3\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c4iG0\n3\u2211\nj \u0001=i\n\u03c4j\n+\n3\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c4iG0\n3\u2211\nj \u0001=i\n\u03c4jG0\n3\u2211\nk \u0001=i \u0001=j\n\u03c4k. (8)\nWe define \u0002k, (\u0002k\u2032) as the initial (final) momentum of the\nprojectile in the projectile-target c.m. system and \u0002q = \u0002k\u2032 \u2212 \u0002k\nas the projectile momentum transfer. Note that we denote wave\nvectors with lowercase \u0002k, whereas capital K denotes kinetic\nenergy operators. The elastic scattering amplitude is written\nF(n)(q) = \u2212\u00b52\u03c0h\u00af2 \u3008\n\u0002k\u2032\u0005(n)|T(n)|\u0002k\u0005(n)\u3009, (9)\nwhere \u0005(n) is the n-body intrinsic wave function of the target\nand \u00b5 is the projectile-target reduced mass. Note that at\nthis stage we use the nonrelativistic expression in the above\nequation. The appropriate relativistic kinematics factor can be\nintroduced following Refs. [2,7,8]. Substituting for T(n=2) from\nEq. (7) we have a sum of four scattering amplitudes, the two\nsingle-scattering ones and the two double scattering ones,\nF(n=2)(q) = F1(q) + F2(q) + F12(q) + F21(q). (10)\nSimilarly, for the case of a three-body target\nF(n=3)(q) =\n3\u2211\ni=1\nFi(q) +\n3\u2211\ni=1\n3\u2211\nj \u0001=i\nFij (q)\n+\n3\u2211\ni=1\n3\u2211\nj \u0001=i\n3\u2211\nk \u0001=i \u0001=j\nFijk(q). (11)\nIII. GLAUBER MULTIPLE SCATTERING\nAccording to Glauber\u2019s multiple-scattering theory the elas-\ntic amplitude for the scattering of a proton from a composite\nnucleus of mass A can be written as an integral over the proton\nimpact parameter plane as [9,10]\nFGL(n) (q) =\nik\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\nd2 \u0002b ei \u0002q\u00b7\u0002b [1 \u2212 S(b)]. (12)\nThe elastic S matrix, as a function of the proton-target c.m.\nimpact parameter b, is\nS(b) = \u3008\u0005(n)|\nn\u220f\nj=1\nSpj (bj )|\u0005(n)\u3009, (13)\nwhere the label j runs over each cluster in the composite\ntarget, with ground-state wave function \u0005(n). In the original\n024608-2\nFEW-BODY MULTIPLE SCATTERING CALCULATIONS . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 024608 (2007)\nformulation by Glauber [11], this summation will of course\nrun over all A nucleons in the target. The S matrices, Spj (bj ),\ndescribe the free scattering of the proton from each target\nconstituent.\nThe Glauber model contains essentially two different\napproximations. As a first step, the adiabatic (or sudden)\napproximation is made [12] in which the internal degrees of\nfreedom of the target (or projectile in the case of inverse kine-\nmatics) nucleus are frozen for the duration of the interaction\ntime. The second approximation is the eikonal, or straight-line,\nassumption.\nIt must be stressed that the composite nucleus S matrix,\nS(b) in Eq. (13), is a many-body matrix element of the target\nground-state n-body density |\u0005(n)|2 and, without considerable\nadditional approximation,S(b) has no simple relationship with\nthe composite nucleus one-body density \u03c1A(r).\nTo make a connection with multiple-scattering terms of\nthe last section and to test the importance of terms in\nEq. (6) beyond single scattering we consider the case of proton\nscattering from an n = 3 cluster target nucleus composed of a\ncore and two valence nucleons as, for example, 6He. (Note that\nthe choice of the proton or the 6He as the projectile does not\nalter the formulation of the scattering amplitude because we\nare working in the c.m. frame.) Thus the three-body S matrix\nof Eq. (13) becomes\nS(b) = \u3008\u0005(n)|Sc(bc)S1(b1)S2(b2)|\u0005(n)\u3009, (14)\nwhere the constituent impact parameters, bc, b1 and b2, are\nshown in Fig. 1 and depend on the c.m. impact parameter b and\nthe projections of the target internal coordinates on the impact\nparameter plane weighted by the masses of the constituents\nrelative to the whole projectile. We can write\n1 \u2212 S(b) = \u3008\u0005(n)|1 \u2212 Sc(bc)S1(b1)S2(b2)|\u0005(n)\u3009\n= \u3008\u0005(n)|[(1 \u2212 Sc) + (1 \u2212 S1) + (1 \u2212 S2)\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 Sc)(1 \u2212 S1) \u2212 (1 \u2212 Sc)(1 \u2212 S2)\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 S1)(1 \u2212 S2) + (1 \u2212 Sc)(1 \u2212 S1)\n\u00d7 (1 \u2212 S2)]|\u0005(n)\u3009. (15)\nSubstituting the above expansion into the expression for the\nGlauber scattering amplitude of Eq. (12) we see that the terms\ncorrespond to just those retained in the forward-scattering\n2b\n1\nbc\nc \u03c1\nr\np\n2 b\nFIG. 1. Schematic representation of the collision of a proton on\na three-cluster nucleus showing the various impact parameters.\napproximation defined in Eq. (11). This is a natural conse-\nquence of the Glauber approximation involving the additivity\nof eikonal phases arising from its own forward-scattering\nassumption. Thus, the Glauber model provides us with a\nlogical justification for our forward-scattering assumption of\nthe previous section, provided of course that the scattering\nenergy is high enough for those assumptions required the\nGlauber model to hold. The first three terms in the above\nexpansion correspond to the single-scattering terms in Eq. (11).\nThe above expansion also gives us a convenient way of testing\nthe relative importance of single scattering and higher-order\nscattering terms when comparing with more precise multiple-\nscattering formulations in the next section. Note that in the\nmultiple-scattering terms the few-body dynamics are properly\ntaken into account because the S matrices are functions of\nboth the c.m. impact parameter and the projections of the\ninternal coordinates of the composite nucleus onto the impact\nparameter plane.\nNote that even the single-scattering terms include effects\nof breakup of the composite nucleus. To reproduce the\nobservables calculated in the single-scattering approximation\nwithin a coupled-channel framework one needs to include\nbreakup channels.\nIV. THE MST FACTORIZED IMPULSE APPROXIMATION\nWithin the impulse approximation (IA), the interaction\nbetween the clusters Vij is assumed to have a negligible\ndynamical effect on the scattering of the projectile from the\nindividual target subsystems and therefore can be neglected.\nThe operator projectile-i target subsystem transition amplitude\n\u03c4i is then replaced by\nt\u02c6i = vi + vi \u02c6G0 t\u02c6i , (16)\nwhere \u02c6G0 contains only the total kinetic energy operator K\n\u02c6G0 = (E+ \u2212 K)\u22121. (17)\nThe transition amplitude t\u02c6i is still a many-body operator,\nbecause the kinetic energy operator K has contributions from\nthe projectile and all n target subsystems. In the approach\nfollowed by Crespo and Johnson [5] the initial relative\nmomenta between the clusters are neglected in the transition\nmatrix elements. One then obtains an FIA expression of a\nproduct of a transition operator and a target form factor\nT FIA(n=3) = \u3008 \u0002Q \u20321|t\u02c61(\u03c91)| \u0002Q1\u3009\u03c112,3\n(\nm2\nM12\n\u0002q, m3\nM123\n\u0002q\n)\n+\u3008 \u0002Q \u20322|t\u02c62(\u03c92)| \u0002Q2\u3009\u03c112,3\n(\nm1\nM12\n\u0002q, m3\nM123\n\u0002q\n)\n+\u3008 \u0002Q \u20323\u03d53|t\u02c63(\u03c93)|\u03d53 \u0002Q3\u3009\u03c112,3\n(\n0,\nM12\nM123\n\u0002q\n)\n+ (\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7),\n(18)\nwhere, within the single-scattering approximation, only the\nfirst three terms are taken into account.

(26)\nWithin the FSA framework the total transition amplitude takes\nthe form [8]\nT FSA(n=3) = \u3008\u0002k \u2032|t\u02dc1(E)|\u0002k\u3009\u03c112,3\n(\nm2\nM12\n\u0002q, m3\nM123\n\u0002q\n)\n+\u3008\u0002k \u2032|t\u02dc2(E)|\u0002k\u3009\u03c112,3\n(\nm1\nM12\n\u0002q, m3\nM123\n\u0002q\n)\n+\u3008\u0002k \u2032\u03d53|t\u02dc3(E)|\u03d53\u0002k\u3009\u03c112,3\n(\n0,\nM12\nM123\n\u0002q\n)\n. (27)\nWe note that in the FSA approach, the energy parameter is E =\nh\u00afk2\/2\u00b5 and, thus, a distinctive feature of the FSA is that the\ntwo-body amplitudes are calculated with the projectile-target\nreduced-mass \u00b5 instead of the projectile-fragment reduced-\nmass \u00b5i . The scattering amplitudes are related to the transition\namplitude\n| \u02dcfi(E)|2 = \u2212 \u00b52\u03c0h\u00af2 |t\u02dci(E)|\n2, (28)\nand at high energies one has\n\u02dcfi(E) \u223c k\nki\n\u02c6fi(\u03c9i), (29)\nan exact relation if the eikonal approximation is used.\nNotice that the Glauber multiple-scattering approach also\nmakes use of the adiabatic approximation [10], and in this\nsense, it is closely related to the FSA rather than the FIA\napproximation.\nVI. CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS\nTo calculate the elastic scattering cross sections for protons\non weakly bound nuclei such as the Borromean halo 6He within\nour models, we require as input the ground-state (three-body)\nwave function of relative motion. We therefore use a realistic\n(Faddeev) three-body wave function that gives the correct two-\nneutron separation energy and root-mean-square (rms) matter\nradii for 6He. The wave function, when used within a few-\nbody Glauber calculation, leads to total reaction cross sections\nthat agree with experiment. The other inputs to our models\nare the on-shell matrix elements of the free elastic scattering\namplitudes for the constituents from the proton target (n + p\nand \u03b1 + p) evaluated at the appropriate energy and momentum\ntransfer. Note also that all cross sections presented here were\ncalculated using relativistic kinematics.\nFor the 6He ground state, we use the FC model wave\nfunction that corresponds to a radius of 2.5 fm and that is\ndescribed in Ref. [13]. We use the same two-body scattering\namplitude for the \u03b1 + p subsystem in the following way. We\nfirst compute the elastic \u03b1 + p \u201cGlauber\u201d S matrix according\nto the prescription of Ref. [10], which is then used in\nEq. (12) to obtain the Glauber scattering amplitude. For the\nFIA and FSA calculations, and to retain the same inputs, we\ntake the \u03b1 + p Glauber S matrix and associate this continuous\nfunction of impact parameter with partial-wave S matrix\nelements at particular \n values using the semiclassical relation\nbk = \n + 1\/2 [9,14]. The transition amplitude is then built\nfrom the sum of partial wave amplitudes.\n024608-4\nFEW-BODY MULTIPLE SCATTERING CALCULATIONS . . .

The data\nare from Refs. [16] (solid points) and [17] (open points).\nFigure 2 shows the calculated elastic differential cross\nsection at 699 MeV as a function of the square of the\nfour-momentum transfer (q2 = \u2212t). It was found that very\nsimilar cross sections were obtained whether we used the\nGlauber S matrix directly in Eq. (12) or carried out a\npartial-wave sum of discrete partial S-matrix elements, S\n.\nTherefore only one theoretical cross section is shown. Because\nthe free NN -scattering parameters are taken from Ref. [15],\nwithout adjustment, and a simple microscopic \u03b1-particle wave\nfunction has been used, the only free parameter available was\nthe assumed rms size of the \u03b1 particle, through r0. The level\nof agreement with the data for the physical rms matter radius\nof 1.49 fm is therefore very encouraging. No attempt was\nmade to fine-tune the NN interaction parameters. In any case\nthe experimental data also have a stated overall normalization\nuncertainty of order \u00b12% [16,17].\nIn the FIA and FSA calculations, the pn on-shell scat-\ntering amplitudes were obtained from a realistic NN Paris\ninteraction, as in Ref. [5]. In the Glauber calculations, each\npairwise NN -scattering operator (S matrix), such as the pnS\nmatrices in Eq. (14), denoted by S1 and S2, is denoted by\nSpj (bj ) = 1 \u2212 \u000bpj (bj ), where bj is the impact parameter of\nthe incident proton relative to target nucleon j . The j label on\n\u000bpj also identifies the use of the pn or pp profile function,\nthe two-dimensional transform of the free NN -scattering\namplitudes\n\u000bpj (bj ) = 12\u03c0ik\n\u222b\nd2 \u0002qe\u2212i \u0002q\u00b7\u0002bj fpj (q).

Experimental and calculated p+6He elastic scattering\nat 717 MeV using the FIA (dashed), the FSA (adiabatic) approxi-\nmation (dotted), and Glauber (solid line). The data are taken from\nRefs. [19\u201321].\nforward-scattering NN amplitudes and the \u03b2pj are the range\nparameters. All parameters are deduced, e.g., Refs. [10,15,18],\nfrom fits to free pp- and pn-scattering data. In Fig. 3 we\ncompare the calculated p+6He cross section using the FIA\n(dashed), the FSA (adiabatic) approximation (dotted), and\nGlauber (solid line) as a function of the squared momentum\ntransfer. In all the three cases, only the single-scattering\ncontribution has been taken into account. The calculated\ndifferential cross sections using FIA and FSA are very similar,\nwhich might indicate that the same physics is retained in\nboth the factorization and the adiabatic approximations. The\ncalculated cross section using Glauber single scattering, which\nalso makes use of the adiabatic assumption, is in very close\nagreement with the other two curves, underlining that the\nsemiclassical approximation used by the Glauber scattering\nframework is valid at this energy.\nIn Fig. 4 the dashed line represents the calculated differen-\ntial elastic cross section for p+6He using the single-scattering\ncontribution to the Glauber amplitude and is obtained from\nthe first three terms in Eq. (15). The effect of including the\nhigher-order scattering terms within the Glauber scattering\nframework defined in Eq. (15) is shown by the solid line.\nBoth calculations reproduce very well the data up to\n0.05(GeV\/c)2. However, at higher-momentum transfers the\nsingle-scattering cross section significantly overestimates the\ndata, whereas the cross section including all higher-order\ncontributions approaches the data. One then concludes that\ndynamical higher-order contributions are very significant at\nthis high-momentum transfer and need to be included. This is\nparticularly true when extracting rms radii from the elastic-\nscattering data. The full Glauber model cross section still\nslightly overestimates the data, however. We note that our few-\nbody Glauber calculation has been compared [10] with one\nmaking making an optical limit (OL) Glauber approximation,\nwhich neglects few-body scattering effects.

And because the free scattering of the \u03b1\ncore reproduces \u03b1 + p scattering very well, although the full\ncross sections have little sensitivity to the exact form of the\npnS matrices at the larger-momentum transfers [8], we can\nconclude that the remaining differences between theory and\nexperiment are likely to be due to the inadequacy of the 6He\nwave function. Nevertheless, the breakdown of the forward\napproximation used by the Glauber scattering framework\ncannot be ruled out and should be investigated due to the\nimplications on the accurate extraction of the rms radii from\nthe elastic-scattering data.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have studied p\u22126He elastic scattering at 717 MeV\nusing the multiple-scattering expansion of the total tran-\nsition amplitude by treating 6He as a three-body system,\nhence having to solve a four-body scattering problem. We\nhave discussed three different approaches. In the Glauber\nmultiple-scattering model we make use of both the adiabatic\nand forward-scattering approximations. Although both these\nassumptions are expected to work well at such scattering\nenergies, it is important, when comparing with experimental\ndata, to delineate the different types of missing physics: those\nnot treated in the scattering process or reaction mechanism\nand those coming from the nuclear structure (in this case of\nthe 6He).\nWe have, therefore, shown comparisons, at the level of\nthe elastic differential cross section, between the Glauber\napproach and two other multiple-scattering methods: the\nfactorized impulse approximation and the fixed scatterer\napproximation. We take only the single-scattering terms in\nthis comparison and show that the Glauber model works\nremarkably well.\nWe have also shown that higher-order dynamical contribu-\ntions are important in describing the data at high-momentum\ntransfers (q2\u30090.05[GeV\/c)2]. Moreover, the calculated cross\nsection using Glauber to all orders still slightly overestimate\nthe data and may indicate inadequacy of the structure model\nused to describe 6He or the breakdown of the Glauber\nscattering framework.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe financial support of Fundac\u00b8a\u02dco para a Cie\u02c6ncia e a\nTecnologia from grant POCTI\/FNU\/43421\/2001 and Acc\u00b8a\u02dco\nIntegrada Luso-Espanhola E-75\/04 is also gratefully acknowl-\nedged.
