It relies on the finite oscillator Lie group, and\nappears applicable to twisted noncommutative QFT and CFT.\n1 Introduction\nConsider the familiar forced oscillator\nH = \u03b1\u2020 \u03b1 + \u03bb(t)\u03b1\u2020 + \u03bb\u2217(t)\u03b1 , (1)\ndriven by an external time-dependent source.\nSince H = exp(\u2212\u03bb(t)\u03b1\u2020 + \u03bb\u2217(t)\u03b1)\n(\n\u03b1\u2020\u03b1 \u2212 |\u03bb(t)|2\n)\nexp(\u03bb(t)\u03b1\u2020 \u2212 \u03bb\u2217(t)\u03b1), the integration of the\nmodel relies on the coherent states [1] underlain by the noncompact oscillator group G (or H4)\n[2]. This is the solvable, rank 2, dimension 4, Lie group generated by the oscillator creation and\nannihilation operators, their Heisenberg commutator (which is central), and the occupation number\noperator. It turns out that this group, G, as well as related Vertex algebras [3], control the structure\nof an infinite dimensional Lie Algebra brought into play in this letter. This algebra, remarkably,\ncontains as subalgebras or limits of it, most of the Lie algebras routinely encountered in physics.\nThe infinite dimensional Lie algebra we introduce in this letter and explore below is\n[Jam1,m2 , J\nb\nn1,n2] = e\nis(m1e\u2212an2\u2212m2ean1)Ja+bm1+ean1, m2+e\u2212an2 \u2212 e\nis(n1e\u2212bm2\u2212n2ebm1)Ja+b\nn1+ebm1, n2+e\u2212bm2\n, (2)\nwhere the upper indices, a, b, the lower ones, m1, m2, .. and the parameter s are arbitrary, unless\nrestricted by some further expediency.\nIt satisfies the Jacobi identity, which is evident from its merely amounting to the antisymmetriza-\ntion of the associative group product,\nJam1,m2J\nb\nn1,n2 = e\nis(m1e\u2212an2\u2212m2ean1)Ja+bm1+ean1, m2+e\u2212an2. (3)\nD Fairlie & C Zachos DCPT-06\/05 ANL-HEP-PR-06-35 Atavistic Lie Algebra hep-th\/0503017 2\n(Associativity amounts to (Jam1,m2J\nb\nn1,n2)J\nc\nk1,k2\n= Jam1,m2(J\nb\nn1,n2J\nc\nk1,k2\n).) Naturally, the symmetrization\nof this product into an anticommutator further yields a consistent graded extension of the Lie algebra.\nThe algebra (2) contains, as a subalgebra specified by vanishing second subscripts,\nm2 = n2 = ... = 0, the Vertex (coherent-state) Algebra [4],\n[Jam, J\nb\nn] = J\na+b\nm+ean \u2212 J\na+b\nn+ebm\n. (4)\nAnother, more familiar and general, subalgebra is the infinite Lie algebra specified by vanishing\nof all superscripts a = b = ... = 0, and by integer subscripts: it is the Sine Algebra [5],\n[Mm1,m2 ,Mn1,n2] = 2i sin (s(m1n2 \u2212m2n1)) Mm1+n1,m2+n2 . (5)\nThis one, in turn, for s = \u2212~\/2, is recognized as the Moyal Bracket algebra on the basis of the\nFourier modes exp(im1x+ im2p) of a toroidal phase space with unit radii [5]. Up to a normalization,\nthe Moyal Brackets represent the antisymmetrization of Groenewold\u2019s celebrated star product [6],\n\u22c6 \u2261 e\ni~\n2\n(\n\u2190\n\u2202 x\n\u2192\n\u2202 p\u2212\n\u2190\n\u2202 p\n\u2192\n\u2202 x) . (6)\nAlternatively, for s = 2\u03c0\/N , and integer N , the sine algebra is seen to represent GL(N), and to\nthus include all classical Lie algebras, (AN , BN , CN , DN) [7]. Furthermore [5], for s\u2192 0 (or N \u2192\u221e),\nthis algebra goes to the algebra of Poisson Brackets, also realized on a toroidal phase space, SDiff(T 2),\ncf [8]; and this one contains the Virasoro algebra as a subalgebra, through judicious summation over\nthe first subscripts m1, n1, ..., [8].\nThis, then, is the basis of our remark that the Lie Algebra introduced encompasses and frames\nquite a range of the Lie algebras normally utilized in physics.\nIn this letter, we explore basic features of this Lie algebra, eqn (2), its applicability, and gener-\nalization. We provide a few explicit useful realizations and representations of restrictions thereof,\nwhich illuminate its structure.\nThroughout, we stress the somewhat untypical correspondence mentioned, which applies both to\nthe algebra (2) itself, as well as the subalgebras we sketched: namely, a finite-dimensional Lie group\nproduct, which yields the infinite Lie algebras when antisymmetrized\u2014and graded (anticommutator)\nextensions, when symmetrized.\n2 The Atavistic Algebra, realizations, and representations\nThe Atavistic Algebra (2) product (3) might be rewritten more symmetrically, through the redefini-\ntion\nV am1,m2 \u2261 J\n2a\neam1, e\u2212am2\n, (7)\nso that the product (3) amounts to\nV am1,m2 V\nb\nn1,n2\n= eis(m1n2e\n\u2212a\u2212b\u2212m2n1ea+b) V a+b\ne\u2212bm1+ean1, ebm2+e\u2212an2\n. (8)\nD Fairlie & C Zachos DCPT-06\/05 ANL-HEP-PR-06-35 Atavistic Lie Algebra hep-th\/0503017 3\nNevertheless, we stick to the original form, to minimize superfluous indices.\nThe semidirect product nature of eqn (3) and thus of the Atavistic Algebra (2) is readily recog-\nnizable by recalling the \u22c6-product underlying the sine algebra (5). We first revert to the version of\nthe star product (6) parameterized for our purpose,\n\u22c6 \u2261 e\u2212is(\n\u2190\n\u2202 x\n\u2192\n\u2202 p\u2212\n\u2190\n\u2202 p\n\u2192\n\u2202 x) , (9)\nwhere x, p range from 0 to 1. The most widely used property of this product is its associativity.\nThus, strings of operators of the form f(x, p)\u22c6, for any functions f(x, p) on the unit T 2, may be\nequivalently evaluated indifferently to the grouping of multiplication chosen. Consequently, choosing\na Fourier mode basis for integers m1, m2, and defining\nMm1,m2 \u2261 exp(i(m1x+m2p)) \u22c6 , (10)\nthe standard product law follows [5],\nMm1,m2Mn1,n2 = exp (is(m1n2 \u2212m2n1)) Mm1+n1,m2+n2 , (11)\nunderlying eqn (5) when antisymmetrized. The finite Lie group corresponding to this product is\nwell-known to be the (dimension 3) Heisenberg group [9].\nNow consider a phase-space-area-preserving dilation operator D(a), which braids associatively as\nD(a) f(x, p) = f(eax, e\u2212ap) D(a). (12)\nA standard realization of this operator is\nD(a) = exp\n(\na(x\n\u2192\n\u2202 x \u2212p\n\u2192\n\u2202 p)\n)\n. (13)\nMoreover, this operator formally commutes with the above star product,\nD(a) \u22c6 = \u22c6 D(a), (14)\nas is plain in integral kernel representations of the star product [6]. More directly, this also follows\nfrom braiding D(a) past the mode\n(\nei(m1x+m2p) \u22c6 ei(m1x+m2p)\n)\n= eis(m1n2\u2212m2n1) ei((m1+n1)x+(m2+n2)p), (15)\nas above, eqn (11). Braiding past the simple right-hand side must equal stepwise braiding past each\nof the factors on the \u22c6-product on the left, so it is manifest that the \u22c6-product remains invariant. Of\ncourse, the reason for the invariance is the area-preservation feature of the dilation operator chosen,\nsince the phase proportioned by s is a two-dimensional cross product, amounting to a phase-space-\narea element.\nFurthermore, evidently,\nD(a)D(b) = D(a+ b), D(0) = 1 . (16)\nD Fairlie & C Zachos DCPT-06\/05 ANL-HEP-PR-06-35 Atavistic Lie Algebra hep-th\/0503017 4\nConsequently, it follows directly that the Atavistic Algebra elements Jam1,m2 may be constructed\nout of Mm1,m2D(a) = J\n0\nm1,m2\nD(a), i.e.,\nJam1,m2 = exp(i(m1x+m2p)) \u22c6 D(a). (17)\nWriting this out explicitly,\nJam1,m2 = e\ni(m1x+m2p) es(m1\u2202p\u2212m2\u2202x) ea(x\u2202x\u2212p\u2202p), (18)\nthe reader may recognize that the product (3) and thus the Atavistic Algebra (2) are, indeed, satisfied.\nThus, operation by the Jam1,m2 on a function f(x, p) on this phase space consists of sequential\nrescalings and shifts of its variables and multiplication by a phase,\nJam1,m2f(x, p) = e\ni(m1x+m2p) f\n(\nea(x\u2212 sm2), e\n\u2212a(p+ sm1)\n)\n. (19)\nThe form (7) corresponds to V am1,m2 = D(a)J\na\nm1,m2 .\n3 Reduction of variables\nNow note that the torus variables x, p commute with each other, so that, effectively, the above\nrealization is a direct product of the same type of operator\nJam1,m2 \u2261 e\nism1m2\/2 eim1x esm2\u2202x eax\u2202x , (20)\nacting on variables x, and, disjointly, acting on variables p, which is to say\nJam1,m2 = J\na\nm1,\u2212m2\n\u2297 J\u2212am2,m1. (21)\nIn turn, the product of these operators is\nJam1,m2J\nb\nn1,n2 = e\n\u2212is(m1e\u2212an2\u2212m2ean1)\/2 Ja+bm1+ean1, m2+e\u2212an2 , (22)\ni.e., the same as eqn (3), for minus half the value of the parameter s. It is plain that, in general\n(irrespective of realization),\nJam1,m2(s) = J\na\nm1,\u2212m2\n(s\/2)\u2297 J\u2212am2,m1(s\/2) . (23)\nThis halving of representations and phases is already apparent in the first of refs [5]: a realization\nintroduced by Hoppe there effectively represents the star product on half the variables of phase space.\nPlainly, this recursive phase-addition phenomenon extends to arbitrarily long direct product strings\nof Js, as a reflection of the simple coproduct structure of their logarithms1.\n1The mathematically inclined reader may recognize the connection of this relation to the Drinfeld twist of quantum\ndeformation coproducts, as implemented by Reshetikhin [10], and exemplified, e.g., by ref [11], eqn (2.13), or ref [12],\neqn (2.5), etc. These outrange the scope of the present discussion.\nD Fairlie & C Zachos DCPT-06\/05 ANL-HEP-PR-06-35 Atavistic Lie Algebra hep-th\/0503017 5\nEquivalently, since oscillator operators, [\u03b1, \u03b1\u2020] = 1, formally parallel the commutation relations\nof [\u2202x, x] = 1, the above realization may also be displayed in a \u201ccoherent state\u201d form,\nJam1,m2 = e\nim1\u03b1\u2020+sm2\u03b1 ea \u03b1\n\u2020\u03b1. (24)\nIn this form, the general Lie subalgebras specified by all m2 \u2192 0, yielding (5); and a \u2192 0, yielding\n(4), are manifest.\nOne would not expect finite dimensional representations for the generic Atavistic Algebra. If\nthe expression eqn (24) looks familiar, it is because it is. It is, in fact, the parameterization of the\noscillator Lie group G investigated by Miller [2]. He provides, in gratifying detail, the representations\nof this Lie group on finite vector spaces (by matrices), unfaithfully; and, faithfully, on infinite-\ndimensional Bargmann space, by differential operators, eqn (19)\u2014for instance, since Jam1,m2f(x) =\neim1(x\u2212sm2\/2) f(ea(x+sm2)), representations on associated Laguerre polynomials are specified by this\nsimple action on the generating functions of these polynomials. Representations on Hermite Hilbert\nspace then follow [2].\nThe four generators of the oscillator group G are abstractions of the operators \u03b1, \u03b1\u2020, 1 , augmented\nby the occupation number operator, normally \u03b1\u2020\u03b1. These are now abstracted to\n[A,A\u2020] = E , [N ,A] = \u2212A, [N ,A\u2020] = A\u2020, [E ,N ] = [E ,A] = [E ,A\u2020] = 0. (25)\nFaithful representations of this need be infinite dimensional; but unfaithful ones could be finite\ndimensional, as long as the central generator E is not the identity. This can be arranged by nilpotent\nmatrices.\nFor example [2], one might consider 3\u00d73 nonhermitean matrices,\nA =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 0 0 00 0 1\n0 0 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , A\u2020 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 0 1 00 0 0\n0 0 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , N =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 1 0 00 0 0\n0 0 1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , E =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed 0 0 \u221210 0 0\n0 0 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 . (26)\nThese represent eqn (25), although note that A\u2020A = \u2212E 6= N , N 2 = N , and (A\u2020)2 = A2 = E2 = 0.\nIn this representation, the proper abstracted analog of (24) reads\nJ am1,m2 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed e\na im1 \u2212ism1m2e\na\/2\n0 1 sm2e\na\n0 0 ea\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (27)\nand satisfies, instead,\nJ am1,m2J\nb\nn1,n2\n= exp\n(\n\u2212is\n2\n(m1e\n\u2212an2 \u2212m2e\nan1)E\n)\nJ a+bm1+ean1, m2+e\u2212an2 . (28)\nHowever,\nexp\n(\n\u2212\nis\n2\n(m1e\n\u2212an2 \u2212m2e\nan1)E\n)\n= 1 \u2212\nis\n2\n(m1e\n\u2212an2 \u2212m2e\nan1)E (29)\nis not a pure phase, as the (traceless) center E is not the identity matrix.\nThe inadequacy of this construction in representing the pure phase appears generic to all finite\ndimensional representations sought. Nevertheless, we illustrate explicitly in the next section that\nfinite dimensional matrix representations can be available for suitable restrictions of the Atavistic\nAlgebra.\nD Fairlie & C Zachos DCPT-06\/05 ANL-HEP-PR-06-35 Atavistic Lie Algebra hep-th\/0503017 6\n4 Finite matrix representations for restricted cases\nSuppose, instead, that we restrict the parameters and indices of the product (3) to s = \u2212\u03c0\/p for an\nodd prime integer p, so that exp(\u22122is) \u2261 \u03c9 = e2\u03c0i\/p, with \u03c9p = 1; and take integer subscripts mod p,\nmj = 0, 1, 2, ..., p\u22121; and rescaled superscripts to be integer mod p\u22121, a\u02dc \u2261 a\/ ln 2 = 0, 1, 2, ..., p\u22122,\nrecalling cyclicity: 2p\u22121 = 1 mod p, for any odd prime integer p.\nThe product now reads\nJ a\u02dcm1,m2J\nb\u02dc\nn1,n2\n= \u03c9(2\na\u02dcm2n1\u22122p\u22121\u2212a\u02dcm1n2)\/2 J a\u02dc+b\u02dc\nm1+2a\u02dcn1, m2+2p\u22121\u2212a\u02dcn2\n. (30)\nThis product (and the corresponding antisymmetrization Lie Algebra) can be represented by\nSylvester\u2019s celebrated p\u00d7 p matrix basis for GL(p) groups [13]. His standard clock and shift unitary\nunimodular matrices, are\nQrt = \u03c9\nr\u03b4r,t , Prt = \u03b4r+1,t , (31)\nfor indices r, t defined mod p, r = 0, 1, 2, ..., p\u2212 1.\nConsequently,\nQp = P p = 1 , PQ = \u03c9 QP, (32)\nthe characteristic braiding identity [9, 5, 7].\nThe complete set of p2 unitary unimodular p\u00d7 p matrices\nM(m1,m2) \u2261 \u03c9\nm1m2\/2 Qm1Pm2 , =\u21d2 (M(m1,m2))rt = \u03c9\nm1(r+m2\/2)\u03b4r+m2,t , (33)\nwhere\nM \u2020(m1,m2) =M(\u2212m1,\u2212m2), (34)\nand TrM(m1,m2) = p\u03b4m1,0\u03b4m2,0, suffice to span the group algebra of GL(p). Since\nM(m1,m2)M(n1,n2) = \u03c9\n(m2n1\u2212m1n2)\/2 M(m1+n1,m2+n2) , (35)\nthey further satisfy the Lie algebra of SU(p), [5], a restriction of the Sine Algebra displayed in the\nIntroduction,\n[M(m1,m2),M(n1,n2)] = 2i sin\n(\n\u03c0\np\n(m2n1 \u2212m1n2)\n)\nM(m1+n1,m2+n2) . (36)\nNow, in addition, consider the discrete scaling (doubling) matrix [14],\nRrt \u2261 \u03b42r,t , R\np\u22121 = 1 , R\u2020 = RT = Rp\u22122, (37)\nagain for indices r, t defined mod p, r = 0, 1, 2, ..., p\u2212 1. The cyclic structure holds by virtue of the\nidentity 2p\u22121 = 1 mod p. (Note that a smaller power of 2 may return to 1 before the power p \u2212 1,\ne.g. 23 = 1 mod 7, but this does not compromise the present construction.)\nD Fairlie & C Zachos DCPT-06\/05 ANL-HEP-PR-06-35 Atavistic Lie Algebra hep-th\/0503017 7\nThe action of the doubling matrix is\nRQRp\u22122 = Q2, Rp\u22122PR = P 2. (38)\nConsequently,\nRa\u02dcQm1Pm2Rp\u22121\u2212a\u02dc = Q2\na\u02dcm1P 2\np\u22121\u2212a\u02dcm2 , (39)\nand hence the unitary matrices\nJ a\u02dcm1,m2 \u2261 M(m1,m2)R\na\u02dc (40)\nsatisfy eqn (30). Thus, these J s provide a p-dimensional representation, and hence a representation of\nthe restricted Atavistic Lie Algebra. Through the direct product recursive procedure of the preceding\nsection, they can be augmented to selected higher dimensional ones.\nHowever, since Sylvester\u2019s basis is complete, R is representable in terms of the above p2 Ms\u2014in\nfact, it is the phased sum of all p\u00d7 p matrices M , normalized by p, since, \u2200m1, m2,\nTr M(m1,m2)R = \u03c9\n\u22123m1m2\/2 . (41)\nThus, since, e.g.,\npJ 10,0 \u2212\n\u2211\nm1,m2\n\u03c9\u22123m1m2\/2 J 0m1,m2 = 0 , (42)\nis represented trivially, the representations displayed are not faithful.\nIt is not hard to generalize to scaling (squeezing) matrices [14] with analogous effects. For instance,\n\u201cFermat\u2019s Little Theorem\u201d [15] dictates np\u22121 = 1 mod p, for any odd prime p and, e.g., 0 < n < p.\nThus, instead of R, a matrix T scaling by n,\nTrt \u2261 \u03b4nr,t , T\np\u22121 = 1 , T \u2020 = T T = T p\u22122, (43)\nacts through log base n, i.e. a = a\u02dc lnn,\nT a\u02dcQm1Pm2T p\u22121\u2212a\u02dc = Qn\na\u02dcm1P n\np\u22121\u2212a\u02dcm2 , (44)\nyielding analogous representations for the restricted Atavistic Lie Algebra. The question as to\nwhether suitable tensor products of such spaces could yield faithful representations, instead, remains\nopen.\n5 Generalizations to linear canonical transforms\nand discussion\nIt turns out that D(a) in Section 2 need not be so restricted, if an associative product of the above\ntype is sought. Indeed, any Sp(2) linear symplectic transformation will do, when it comes to leaving\nD Fairlie & C Zachos DCPT-06\/05 ANL-HEP-PR-06-35 Atavistic Lie Algebra hep-th\/0503017 8\nthe star product invariant [16] (over and above preserving areas and Poisson Brackets\u2014but nonlinear\nSDiff(T 2) does not, in general). Thus, D(a) may be generalized to a matrix S with detS = 1, in\n(\nx\np\n)\n7\u2192 S\n(\nx\np\n)\n. (45)\nThe above D(a) corresponds to the special case S =diag(ea, e\u2212a). The transformation matrix needs\ntransposition, ST , to act on the Fourier mode coefficients\u2019 doublets (m1, m2). The Atavistic Algebra\nthen further extends to the associative products of operators\nJSm1,m2 = exp(i(m1x+m2p)) \u22c6 S, (46)\nwhere, naturally, the matrix superscripts multiply, and the cross product in the phase is between\nthe untransformed and suitably transformed subscript doublet. This formal structure parallels sym-\nplectic squeezing of light [1, 16, 14], where the Sp(2) linear symplectic transformation amounts to a\nBogoliubov transformation.\nWe expect that this product structure, whose antisymmetrization yields the corresponding gen-\neralized Atavistic Lie Algebra, is sufficiently general to find applications in a broad variety of physics\ncontexts. That is, the associative product f(x, p)\u22c6g(S(x, p)) is a tractable generalization of the stan-\ndard \u22c6-product, and should be relevant to squeezed state, or lattice\/brane deconstruction contexts, in\nwhich f(x, p) is defined at one end of a link (brane) and g(x, p) on the other, the symplectic transfor-\nmation S providing the link transition function. Moreover, the Drinfeld twist coproduct exemplified\nin Section 3 bears compelling intuitive connections to applications of this twist in noncommutative\nQFT [12] and deformation-generalized CFT [17], currently under investigation.\nThis work was supported by the US Department of Energy, Division of High Energy Physics, Contract\nW-31-109-ENG-38; and the Collaborative Project GEP1-3327-TB-03 of the US Civilian Research\nand Development Foundation.
