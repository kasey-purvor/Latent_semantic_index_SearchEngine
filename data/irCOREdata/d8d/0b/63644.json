INTRODUCTION\nClimate processes are a major determinant of the structure\nand function of ecological systems (McGowan et al. 1998;\nStenseth et al. 2002). A wide range of studies have shown\nlinks between fluctuations in climate and ecological\nprocesses in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems\n(McGowan et al. 1998; Attrill & Power 2002; Stenseth\net al. 2002; Quetin & Ross 2003). In marine ecosystems,\nthe impact of climate-related physical fluctuations can\nbe both direct: through local atmospheric effects, and\nindirect: through remote changes in oceanic or sea ice\nprocesses that show marked coherent spatial and temporal\nvariability (Stenseth et al. 2003; Pershing et al. 2004). As a\nresult, interannual and sub-decadal fluctuations in large-\nscale climate processes, such as the El Nin\u02dco Southern\nOscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation\n(NAO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, can have a\nstrong influence on local ecological processes in oceanic\necosystems (Stenseth et al. 2002, 2003). Understanding\nhow ecosystems respond to such climate-driven oceanicic supplementary material is available at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.\nb.2007.1180 or via http:\/\/www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk.\nr for correspondence (e.murphy@bas.ac.uk).\n19 July 2007\n30 August 2007\n3057variation is required for predicting long-term responses to\nchange and management of fisheries (Attrill & Power\n2002; Ottersen et al. 2004a,b).\nThe impacts of climate-related fluctuations are difficult\nto distinguish owing to the complexity of marine\necosystems (Stenseth et al. 2002, 2003). The multiple\nscales of interaction between physical and biological\nprocesses, and within biological systems, generate complex\ninteraction and feedback effects (Stenseth et al. 2002).\nBiologically, individuals and populations can be affected\ndirectly through physiology or indirectly via the food web\nthrough prey, predator and competitive interactions.\nThese processes can generate a range of impacts on\npopulations and communities, including variable effects on\nmales or females or on different stages of life cycles, delays\nthrough variation in cohort success or feedbacks in food\nwebs, density-dependent population effects and changes in\nthe frequency of population fluctuation or species\ninteraction (Royama 1992; Ottersen & Stenseth 2001;\nStenseth et al. 2002, 2003; Ottersen et al. 2004a,b).\nOne region in which the effect of climate fluctuations\non ocean ecosystems has been extensively studied is the\nNorth Atlantic. Recent reviews have considered the\ncomplex indirect, direct and interactive effects of climate\non this system (Ottersen et al. 2001, 2004b). The copepodThis journal is q 2007 The Royal Society\n3058 E. J. Murphy et al. Climate impacts on ocean ecosystemsCalanus finmarchicus is a key species in the North Atlantic\necosystem, and an important factor determining its\nabundance in the shelf areas of the eastern North Atlantic\n(North Sea) is the extent of advection of this species\ninto the region via the inflow of cooler waters (Pershing\net al. 2004). This inflow is influenced by the state of the\nNAO, with cooler waters being dominant when the NAO\nindex is negative. The authors call variations in the inflow\nof C. finmarchicus a direct translation effect that is due\nto climate-related shifts in advection. Such improved\ninsight into the mechanisms that generate fluctuations in\nnatural systems is key to predicting future change (Stenseth\net al. 2002).\nIn the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean,\ncorrelations have been noted between fluctuations in the\nproduction and survival of penguins, seals and other\npredators and physical variations (atmospheric and\noceanic) in the equatorial Pacific (Croxall et al. 1988;\nForcada et al. 2005). However, although the dynamics of\nthe predator populations have been modelled to take\naccount of the remote fluctuations, so far it has only been\npossible to speculate on the mechanisms involved in\ngenerating these correlations. The upper trophic-level\npredators that occur in such vast numbers in the Southern\nOcean give a view of the overall health of this unique\necosystem. One of the key features of this system is the\nimportance of one particular species, Antarctic krill\n(Euphausia superba Dana; Croxall et al. 1988). Antarctic\nkrill (termed krill) have a circumpolar distribution but are\nmost abundant in the Scotia Sea and Antarctic Peninsula\nregions where they are a key species in the food web and a\ntarget of a commercial fishery (Atkinson et al. 2004). Here\nwe elucidate some of the mechanisms linking climate\nvariations in the equatorial Pacific and this remote\ndynamic ecosystem some 10 000 km away. We find that\nfluctuations in the physical characteristics of the Atlantic\nsector of the Southern Ocean are associated with Southern\nHemisphere-scale oceanic and climatic variation. We also\nfind that the signal is mediated through krill via physical-\nbiological interactions affecting their population dynamics\nand large-scale distribution which in turn impacts the\nbreeding success of krill-dependent penguins and seals.\nThese results provide a preliminary basis for predictions of\nthe response of these ecosystems to fishing and natural and\nhuman-induced climate change.2. METHODS AND DATA\n(a) Sea surface temperature and sea ice data\nTo examine physical variability, we used one-degree res-\nolution monthly National Oceanographic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) optimum interpolation (OI) sea\nsurface temperature (SST) V2 and sea ice data (Reynolds\net al. 2002) from the IRL\/LDEO Climate Data Library. To\nconsider the large-scale links between the ENSO and the\nSouthern Ocean, we used two NCEP SST-derived ENSO\nindices. Nino-4 gives an index of SST variation in the western\nequatorial Pacific and is the SST anomaly averaged over 5oS\nto 58N and 1608E to 1508W. Nino-3 gives an index of SST\nvariation in the eastern equatorial Pacific and is the SST\nanomaly averaged over 58S to 58N and 1508W to 908W. The\nannual and monthly Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index\ndata (Marshall 2003) were obtained from http:\/\/www.nerc-\nbas.ac.uk\/icd\/gjma\/sam.html.Proc. R. Soc. B (2007)(b) Krill populations and climate fluctuations\nTo examine whether fluctuations in the krill population were\nrelated to oceanic variations, we used annual acoustically\nderived estimates of biomass from South Georgia (see\nMurphy et al. 2007 for references), historically derived\nestimates of abundance (numerical density) from net\nsampling across the South Atlantic (Atkinson et al. 2004)\nand estimates of the mean length of krill consumed by\nAntarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella, termed fur seals) at\nSouth Georgia during March (Reid et al. 1999). We used\nlinear multiple regression models (Coulson et al. 2000; Aanes\net al. 2002) to examine the factors influencing krill population\ngrowth rates (abundance and biomass) and changes in length.\nMaximum-likelihood methods were used for model fitting.\nThis approach examines the relative influence on the\ndynamics of autoregressive (here we used a single 1-year\nautoregressive term, based on the natural log of either\npopulation density or biomass) and lagged environmental\nvariable effects (we included up to 2-year lags of SST, sea ice\nconcentration and sea ice extent). We used only environ-\nmental variables (SST and sea ice) from the South Atlantic\nsector in the analyses of krill dynamics (see electronic\nsupplementary material for details of timing of variables\nused). Significant autoregressive terms are sometimes\nconsidered to indicate density-dependent effects of changes\nin mortality or growth in relation to population size.\nHowever, these can arise through a range of interaction\neffects or census issues and may not be the result of\npopulation density dependence (Royama 1992; Freckleton\net al. 2006).\nThe krill abundance (numerical density) across the region\nshows a significant negative trend over the last 30 years\n(Atkinson et al. 2004). We therefore removed the exponential\ndecline (ln Nt Z153.22K0.0756 t, R\n2Z35%, p!0.005)\nfrom the abundance series to generate a stationary series\n(Xt), which was then used to derive the per capita growth rates\n(Rt), where:\nRt ZXtC1KXt :\nAkaike Information Criterion (AICc) was applied to\nconsider model fit and identify the simplest most appropriate\nmodel in each case (Coulson et al. 2000; Aanes et al. 2002).\nLinear models of the form used here can be useful for\nexamining the combined effects of population and climate\nprocesses and can give a reasonable representation of\nnonlinear effects in some populations. However, we also\nneed to understand the mechanisms involved in generating\ndensity-dependent and density-independent effects (Coulson\net al. 2000; Ottersen & Stenseth 2001; Stenseth et al. 2002).\nHere we combine the multiple regression approach with a\ndemographic model analysis to examine some of the\nmechanisms involved.\nFurther details of methods used are given in the electronic\nsupplementary material.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n(a) Pacific and South Atlantic variations in SST\nSignals of ENSO variability in the tropical Pacific are\nknown to propagate to high latitudes through atmospheric\nteleconnection and oceanic processes (Kwok & Comiso\n2002; Liu et al. 2002, 2004; White et al. 2002; Meredith\net al. 2004, 2005, in press; Turner 2004).

Note also the significant correlations with SST in the equatorial Pacific, indicative of the direct connection with the\nENSO region. The Pacific\u2013South American teleconnection pattern (alternating positive and negative anomalies extending to\nhigh latitudes in the Pacific) is clearly visible. (b\u2013d ) are with progressive yearly lags, and essentially track the anomalies back\nthrough time from the region around South Georgia \u2018upstream\u2019 into the Pacific. Twelve months before anomalies reach South\nGeorgia, they occupy the southeast Pacific west of Drake Passage, the central South Pacific 24 months earlier and the area in the\nwestern South Pacific 36 months earlier.\nClimate impacts on ocean ecosystems E. J. Murphy et al. 3059decades, ENSO-related variation throughout the South\nPacific and Atlantic regions has been quasi-cyclic, with the\nperiodicity varying approximately between 4 and 6 years,\nbut with marked variation in anomaly intensity and\nduration on decadal and longer time scales (White &\nPeterson 1996; Trathan & Murphy 2002; Carleton 2003;\nTurner 2004). Southern Ocean atmosphere, ocean and\nsea ice systems are strongly coupled showing marked\nvariation on time scales ranging from years to decades and\nbetween regions (Carleton 2003; Turner 2004). Spatial\ncorrelation analysis of the global SST anomaly field with\nvariations at South Georgia in the South Atlantic reveals a\nwave-like progression (figure 1). As the anomalies\npropagate across the South Pacific and into the South\nAtlantic sectors, they are correlated with the changingProc. R. Soc. B (2007)phases of ENSO in the equatorial region of the Pacific.\nChanges in atmospheric circulation patterns across the\nsouthwest Pacific associated with ENSO variation provide\na mechanism for the generation of SST anomalies in the\nPacific sector of the Southern Ocean (Li 2000; White et al.\n2002; Turner 2004). The propagating signal shows\nconsistent correlations (rO0.5: 95% significance level for\nr is between approximately 0.25 and 0.33) meridionally\nacross the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and\nover more than 3000 km east\u2013west (figure 1).\nCross-correlation analyses of SST data from locations\nalong 608S show that positive anomalies in the ENSO\nregion variation occur approximately 2\u20133 years prior to\npositive anomalies close to South Georgia (Trathan &\nMurphy 2002; Meredith et al. in press; figure 1 in the\n1985 1990 1995 2000\nyear\n\u20130.6\n\u20130.4\n\u20130.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n\u20131.5\n\u20131.0\n\u20130.5\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n(a)\n(b)\nSS\nT \nan\nom\nal\ny \n(\u00b0C\n)\nFigure 2.

A four-\nmonth moving average was applied to the predicted series to\nremove high-frequency monthly variability for plotting. (See\nelectronic supplementary material for further details.)\n3060 E. J. Murphy et al. Climate impacts on ocean ecosystemselectronic supplementary material). The observation of\nslow propagating anomalies across the South Pacific sector\ninto the Atlantic is consistent with the concept of a\npropagating anomaly wave (White & Peterson 1996)\nmoving in association with the ACC (Murphy et al. 1995;\nWhite et al. 2002; Venegas 2003). Alternatively, these\nvariations may be the result of spatial differences in the\ngeographical relationships of SST variation across the\nsouthern Pacific fluctuating in phase with ENSO (Park\net al. 2004) or some combination of these processes. The\nobserved pattern of positive anomalies in the southeast\nPacific coinciding with negative anomalies in the south-\nwest Atlantic (and vice versa) is also consistent with the\noperation of the Antarctic Dipole (Yuan & Martinson\n2000; Carleton 2003); it may also depend in part on the\nunusual footprint in the southeast Pacific of the SAM\n(Meredith et al. in press; see Thompson & Solomon 2002\nfor a discussion of SAM).\nThe anomalies and their propagation are not simply\natmospheric effects impacting locally on the ocean surface.\nRegional studies show that changes in SST around South\nGeorgia also show variability due to sub-surface changes\nin temperature and salinity that originate remotely (and\nover a broad area) several months previously (Meredith\net al. 2005). Such oceanic advection of temperature\nanomalies is also evidenced by expendable bathythermo-\ngraph measurements at Drake Passage (see www.hrx.ucsd.\nedu). These anomalies propagate across the region into\nthe Atlantic sector generating warm and cold periods\ngenerally lasting 2\u20133 years in particular regions (electronic\nsupplementary material, figures 1 and 2).\nDuring the intense El Nin\u02dco period of 1997\u20131998,\natmospheric changes in the ENSO region appeared to\nhave a strong, direct, short-term (less than six months)\neffect on the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean\n(electronic supplementary material, figures 1 and 2;\nTurner 2004; Meredith et al. 2005). This was confirmed\nthrough multiple regression analyses, which showed that aProc. R. Soc. B (2007)model including both a propagating oceanic signal in the\nSouth Pacific sector (10 months prior) and equatorial\nregion variation (four months prior) explained more of the\nSouth Atlantic sector variation (R2Z30%; figure 2) than a\nmodel just based on the propagating signal of the South\nPacific sector (R2Z21%; see also electronic supple-\nmentary material). Meredith et al. (2004) showed that\ndirect atmospheric forcing associated with the 1997\u20131998\nEl Nin\u02dco dominated the upper ocean stratification at the\nwestern Antarctic Peninsula during this period. Multiple\nregression analyses including the SAM index indicate that\nthe majority of the variations (28% out of 30%) in the\nScotia SSTs are explained by a model including both\nsoutheast Pacific sector and ENSO region SST variations.\nInclusion of the SAM index (Meredith et al. in press), or a\nsecondary ENSO index, explains the remaining 2% of the\nvariability (see electronic supplementary material,\ntable 2).\nChanges in regional SST are coupled to variations in\nseasonal sea ice thermodynamics (White & Peterson\n1996; Hall & Visbeck 2002; Liu et al. 2004; Trathan\net al. 2006). Within the South Atlantic sector, cold periods\naround South Georgia (north of the seasonally covered sea\nice zone) tend to occur when sea ice is further north in the\nScotia Sea during the previous winter and vice versa, such\nthat changes in sea ice distribution lead SST fluctuations\nby less than six months (electronic supplementary\nmaterial, figure 3).\n(b) Population dynamics of krill in the Scotia Sea\nHaving established that interannual variation in Scotia Sea\nSSTand sea ice extent depends significantly upon external\nforcing, we next examined the impact of these fluctuations\non the krill population. We compared krill abundance\nacross the South Atlantic with krill biomass estimates from\nlocal surveys at South Georgia (figure 3a). Although these\ndata series are short, the pattern of fluctuations shows a\ndelay between a change in numbers and biomass which is\nconsistent with current views of krill population dynamics\n(Murphy et al. 1998; Murphy & Reid 2001). Krill\nabundance across the South Atlantic sector was lowest\nwhen biomass was also low at South Georgia (figure 3c).\nThese low biomass periods were also observed when krill\nlength was most variable (figure 3d ). Animals were more\nconsistent in size (approx. 46\u201349 mm) during periods of\nhigher biomass.\nWe examined the influence of physical fluctuations in\nthe South Atlantic on krill population dynamics. We found\na strong positive relationship between the population\ngrowth rates derived from the biomass series (ln[BtC1\/Bt],\nwhere Bt is the krill biomass in year t) and SST 2 years\nearlier (i.e. 12\u201324 months after a warm spring, there is an\nincrease in biomass) (table 1, M1). The model identified\nby AICc (M2) included only SST variables for the zero-lag\nspring (negative) and the summer 2 years earlier (positive;\nM2). There is also a significant secondary influence of\npopulation size (B0), indicating that population effects\nmay also be important (M3 and M4; electronic supple-\nmentary material, table 3). However, the magnitude of the\nregression coefficient for B0 varied between 0.60 and 1.18,\nwhich indicates a highly damped population response to\nvariability and hence very weak direct density dependence.\nMore complex models indicate combined effects of SST\nand sea ice conditions 2 years earlier but do not include\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n8\n10\n12\n14\nw\nea\nn\nin\ng \nm\nas\ns (\nkg\n)\n40 42 44 46 48 50 52\n300\n350\n400\n450\n500\n550\n600\n650\n\u20131.0 \u20130.5 0 0.5 1.0\n38\n40\n42\n44\n46\n48\n50\n52\n54\nle\nng\nth\n (m\nm)\nle\nng\nth\n (m\nm)\nle\nng\nth\n (m\nm)\n\u20131.0 \u20130.5 0\nSST anomaly (\u00b0C, lag 13 months) SST anomaly (\u00b0C, lag 23 months)\n0.5 1.0\n38\n40\n42\n44\n46\n48\n50\n52\n54\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n38\n40\n42\n44\n46\n48\n50\n52\n54\n1990 1995 2000 2005\nyear year\n1\n10\n100\nkr\nill\n d\nen\nsit\ny \n(gm\n\u2013\n2 :\n N\nm\n\u2013\n2 )\nbi\nom\nas\ns (\ng m\n\u2013\n2 )\nabundance (Nm\u20132)\nbiomass (gm\u20132)\nbiomass (gm\u20132)\nle\nng\nth\n (m\nm)\nn\nu\nm\nbe\nr o\nf f\nur\n se\nal\n p\nup\ns\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n1990 1995 2000 2005\n38\n40\n42\n44\n46\n48\n50\n52\n54\nlength (mm)\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d )\n(e) ( f )\n(g) (h)\nFigure 3.

J. Murphy et al. Climate impacts on ocean ecosystemspopulation effects (table 1, M5; electronic supplementary\nmaterial). There was no indication of a significant delayed\ndensity-dependent effect. The dominance of climate-\nrelated variations (M1\u2013M5) indicates that the biomass\nfluctuations are driven mainly by the delayed effects of\nSST variation 2 years earlier, with an additional influence\nof physical conditions (SST) in the summer of recruitment\n(M2). Krill around South Georgia are at least 2 years old,\nalthough they are usually considered to be 3 years old\nwhen they become the dominant biomass class. This\nsuggests that environmental conditions affecting the\nproduction, survival and dispersal of the 0 or 1 age classes\nhave a significant delayed influence on the biomass of krill\naround South Georgia 2 years later.\nExamining the krill population growth rates based on\nthe residual fluctuations in abundance (XtC1KXt), there\nare significant population (direct density dependence) and\nenvironmental effects (SST and sea ice variation; table 1,\nM6\u2013M10; electronic supplementary material). However,\nthere are also indications that delayed density-dependent\neffects are a significant influence (M7\u2013M10). This\nsuggests that intrinsic density-dependent population\nprocesses are more important in generating fluctuations\nin abundance than in biomass. The parameter values in\nthe models including both Nt (abundance at time t) and\nNtK1 terms suggest oscillatory dynamics in a declining\nseries. The coefficients for the lag population effects are\nbetween K0.5 and K1.0 and the direct effects are\napproximately K0.75, which correspond to oscillations\nwith a period of approximately 5 years. The application of\nAICc identified model M9, which includes terms Nt, NtK1\nand shows a positive relationship with ice extent 2 years\nearlier. The coefficients in models M7 and M9 suggest\ndamped population-driven oscillations and indicate that\ndensity-dependent effects dominate (R2Z61%), while the\nice conditions 2 years earlier explain a further 26% of the\nvariation about the trend. More complex three-variable\nmodels also indicate that sea ice and SSTover the previous\n2 years influence population growth rate (table 1;\nelectronic supplementary material, table 3). The influence\nof SST is sensitive to the inclusion of other modelProc. R. Soc. B (2007)variables, but there are consistent indications that\nextensive winter sea ice has a positive impact on\npopulation abundance 2 years later. This indicates that\nfor the abundance series, the winter conditions during the\nperiod of egg production and larval development are\ncrucial. It should be noted that the one- and two-variable\nmodels explain a relatively low percentage of the variation\nin the observed series, the number of observations is small\nand some model coefficients have low levels of statistical\nsignificance. Detrending time series can also generate\nchanges in the frequency of fluctuations and may have\nintroduced some of the autoregressive variation in such\nshort series.\nThe analyses highlight the differences between the\nbiomass and abundance series, which refer to different\ngeographical regions and year classes. The abundance\ndata refer to the whole Atlantic sector, including the main\nrecruitment regions of the southern Scotia Sea and around\nthe Scotia Arc. Density-dependent effects in the abun-\ndance series may indicate that food availability or survival\nis affected by population size in the central recruitment\nregions of the southern Scotia Sea. The biomass series\nrelate to a very local region on the northern edge of the\ndistribution where the population is dependent on the\ninflux of older age groups and density-independent factors\nhave a stronger influence. The differences between the\nabundance and biomass series and analyses are further\nhighlighted by the results that show that summer\ntemperatures have a zero-lag positive influence on\nabundance but a negative impact on biomass. The\nnegative influence of local temperatures on biomass is\nconsistent with previous views that periods of low biomass\noccur when conditions are warm around South Georgia,\nwhich may reflect a reduced influence of cooler polar\nwaters. The positive influence on abundance may reflect\nhigh abundance of young (0- or 1-year-old) age groups in\nthe southern regions of the Scotia Sea when winter sea ice\nis less extensive across the region. The 2-year lag effects\nalso show some differences in the analyses of biomass and\nabundance, which again are likely to reflect the different\nscales of the processes involved. The effects of sea ice\nClimate impacts on ocean ecosystems E. J. Murphy et al. 3063fluctuations are positive and the same for biomass and\nabundance, in that more extensive sea ice leads to an\nincrease in abundance and biomass 2 years later. This\nindicates an increase in abundance across the Scotia Sea\nand increased recruitment influx into the South Georgia\nregion of animals that are 1 or 2 years old. However,\nwarmer summer temperatures precede an increase in\nbiomass 2 years later, whereas there is little evidence of an\nimpact on abundance. The effect on biomass of a one-\ndegree change in SSTK2 is approximately five times as\nlarge as that for SST0, and in the opposite direction,\nindicating that local conditions 2 years earlier are crucial.\nThis may in part reflect a rapid transition from warm to\ncold conditions in a cyclical system, which may lead to\ncounter-intuitive relationships. However, the biomass data\nare local to South Georgia, where there are indications\nthat warm periods are associated with reduced krill\nbiomass and low recruitment (Murphy & Reid 2001).\nExamining the factors influencing the rate of change in\nkrill length between years gives similar results to those for\nbiomass, indicating that physically driven fluctuations\ndominate the dynamics (see the electronic supplementary\nmaterial). However, mean length shows consistent\nchanges between years and is a significant predictive\nvariable for change in length. Exploring length relation-\nships in more detail, cross-correlation analyses of length\nagainst SST over the previous 36 months highlighted a\nstrong negative relationship with SST 12\u201316 months\nearlier (figure 3e), and a strong positive relationship 23\u201328\nmonths earlier, such that small krill dominated 2 years\nafter very cold conditions (figure 3 f ). The smallest\nanimals (mean length!43 mm) occurred in the diet of\nfur seals when SST in the previous summer was high,\nwhile the largest animals (mean lengthO48 mm) occurred\nwhen SST in the previous summer was coldest. As noted\nabove, extreme lengths reflect periods of low biomass\n(figure 3d ), and the influx of small animals (30\u201340 mm)\ninto the population is also associated with interannual\nchanges in biomass (figure 3a,b). We consider that this\nreflects a recruitment event following one or more years of\nlittle or no recruitment during a warm phase. Thus, good\nrecruitment at South Georgia is easiest to detect at the\nbeginning of the cold phase due to the absence of older age\nclasses. Recruitment and a subsequent increase in biomass\nare therefore associated with cold periods (Trathan et al.\n2003). These analyses are consistent with a view of a\nmulti-age-class population with irregular fluctuations in\nrecruitment (Murphy et al. 1998; Murphy & Reid 2001;\nReid et al. 2002), which are linked with regional changes in\noceanic conditions. The direct density-dependent effects\nreflect changes in age-class size resulting from fluctuations\nin recruitment, growth and mortality. Direct and indirect\ndensity-dependent effects of increased recruitment at low\ndensities and reduced recruitment at high densities may\nalso be occurring at a larger scale (Royama 1992).\nTemperature can be important in determining krill\ndevelopment and growth rate both directly (through\nimpact on physiological processes) and indirectly (through\nthe availability of food; Atkinson et al. 2006). However,\nhere we considered animals that ranged approximately\nfrom 30 to more than 55 mm and were between 1\u20132 and\nabove 4 years old (Murphy & Reid 2001; Reid et al. 2002).\nGrowth rate variation could be a contributory factor, butProc. R. Soc. B (2007)a consistent change in population size structure over a\nnumber of years indicates cohort effects.\nTo develop a more mechanistic understanding, and test\nthis view of a multi-age-class population with recruitment\nlinked to environmental changes, we used an age-\nstructured model of the regional krill population to\nsimulate the population changes. Based on the analyses\nof krill length in relation to SST (figure 3e, f ), the model\nassumes the strength of a small subadult krill age class\n(30\u201340 mm, taken to be 2 years old in the simulation) to\nbe a density-independent, nonlinear function of SST 1 or\n2 years earlier. The model reproduces the major\nfluctuations in krill length observed in the diet of fur\nseals at South Georgia (figure 3b), but the outcomes are\nsensitive to the parametrization of the function relating\nrecruitment to changes in the temperature of the previous\nseason. The derived parametrizations tend to emphasize\nthe nonlinear nature of the response to temperature,\nhighlighting irregular recruitment events over a restricted\nrange of SST. This analysis is consistent with the main\nconclusions of the regression analyses and supports the\nview that environment-driven recruitment fluctuation has\ndominated the population dynamics around South\nGeorgia in recent years. The nonlinearity may in part be\nthe result of density-dependent effects, but these are not\nincluded in the demographic model.\nThe analyses suggest a two-stage environmental impact\non the dynamics of South Atlantic krill populations. First,\na delayed effect of sea ice conditions 2 years earlier on\nabundance, which relates to the production, survival and\ndevelopment of the larval and juvenile krill (production\nrecruitment). Second, there is a same year effect of spring\nand summer temperatures, which probably reflects a\ndistribution and dispersal effect across the Scotia Sea and\nthe degree of influence of cooler polar waters in northern\nregions around South Georgia (dispersal recruitment).\nThe length of krill in the diet of fur seals at South Georgia\nis measured during March and can identify a dispersal\nrecruitment event the season before the biomass changes\n(Reid et al. 1999; Murphy & Reid 2001). This is the\nprobable explanation for why 1-year lag physical effects\n(SST fluctuations) are evident in the analyses of length\nand 2-year lag effects on changes in local biomass. Very\nwarm periods of lowest recruitment tend, therefore, to\nprecede the seasons of lowest biomass by 1 year and the\nnext cold period and the associated recruitment and\nbiomass increase by 2 years. The view that large-scale\nphysical fluctuations affect recruitment across the Scotia\nSea is also consistent with previous analyses, which\nindicate that changes in population structure and\nabundance occur in the same year across the Scotia Sea\nand Antarctic Peninsula regions (Murphy et al. 1998;\nMurphy & Reid 2001; Fach et al. 2002, 2006; Reid et al.\n2002; Quetin & Ross 2003; Atkinson et al. 2004; Siegel\n2005). The interpretation that fluctuations in krill\nrecruitment around South Georgia are strongly physically\ndriven may be particularly appropriate in this system for a\nnumber of reasons: (i) at present, krill abundance across\nthe region is thought to be low compared with two to three\ndecades ago (Atkinson et al. 2004), (ii) krill abundance\nacross the northern Scotia Sea is thought to depend on\ndispersal which in turn is linked to the physical conditions,\nand (iii) the quasi-cyclic nature of the environmental\nvariation is likely to result in marked interannual\n3064 E. J. Murphy et al. Climate impacts on ocean ecosystemsfluctuations in conditions for production and dispersal.\nThe evidence that krill recruitment is also strongly linked\nto SSTand sea ice conditions further strengthens the view\nthat climate-related variation is an important control on\nkrill abundance in the Scotia Sea region. However, this\ninterpretation must be treated with some caution as the\ndata series are short, the environmental data are cyclical\nand there are indications from the analyses of the large-\nscale abundance data that density-dependent processes\nmay also be important. Such density-dependent popu-\nlation effects, including variation in mortality rate with\npopulation density, along with food web effects (such as\ncompetition of krill with salps or copepods) may\ncontribute to the observed interannual fluctuations but\nare difficult to distinguish in such a short series (Royama\n1992; Murphy et al. 2007). More complex models will be\nuseful in exploring the detail of the mechanisms involved\n(Constable et al. 2003).(c) Krill and predator fluctuations\nWe also examined whether the changes in krill abundance\nand biomass affect the land-based predators. We found\nthat fur seal pup production (pups surviving at the end of\nthe breeding season; Forcada et al. 2005) is strongly\nassociated with changes in krill size in the diet of lactating\nseals (figure 3g). Hence, the smallest krill occur in the diet\nat about the time of the lowest krill biomass, when pup\nproduction and survival are lowest. Weaning mass may be\na better index of such short-term effects and analyses\nindicate that it is highly variable when krill biomass is low,\nbut also show that the lowest weaning masses were\nrecorded in years of extremely low krill biomass\n(figure 3h). This variation associated with low biomass\nestimates is not surprising given the known limitations of\nshort-term (weeks) biomass surveys, which cannot\ncapture the seasonal variability in krill biomass, but are\nconsidered to be useful in identifying years of very low\nbiomass. Low pup production occurs at times when other\nkrill-dependent predators (such as macaroni and gentoo\npenguins and black-browed albatross) also show low\nbreeding performance (Croxall et al. 1988; Murphy et al.\n1998). These analyses support the view that periods of\nreduced predator breeding performance are the result of\nlow prey availability rather than direct local weather or\noceanic effects (Croxall et al. 1988; Trathan et al. 2006).\nWe conclude therefore that the observed correlation\nbetween breeding performance of a suite of krill predators\nand local SST (e.g. Trathan et al. 2006) is mediated by\ntheir prey. Krill recruitment failure takes a year to affect\nlocal krill biomass and availability to predators. This\ngenerates the observed 1 year delay between local SST\nvariation and changes in predator breeding performance.\nYears of small krill size reflect a transition of low\nrecruitment and declining krill biomass during warm\nyears to a cold phase of good recruitment and a\nsubsequent increase in krill biomass. We stress that\nowing to the nature of the functional response (e.g. pup\nproduction or weaning mass in relation to krill size or\nbiomass: figure 3g,h) monitoring predator performance is\nmuch better suited to detecting years of low krill biomass,\nduring the transition phases, than the subsequent periods\nof high biomass.Proc. R. Soc. B (2007)(d) Climate interactions in ocean ecosystems\nTogether, the analyses of physical and biological data\nprovide insight into some of the mechanisms involved in\ngenerating correlations between ENSO-related fluctu-\nations in oceanic conditions across the equatorial Pacific\nand changes in higher predator biology in the Scotia Sea.\nThe strong connections between sea ice and ENSO\nvariability across the whole area result in correlations\nbetween ENSO variation and krill recruitment and also\npredator population dynamics (Murphy et al. 1998;\nFraser & Hofmann 2003; Quetin & Ross 2003; see the\nelectronic supplementary material for further discussion).\nAs the sea ice variation is quasi-cyclic, we see related cycles\nin krill populations. Such quasi-cyclic environmental\nvariation is a persistent feature in the Southern Ocean.\nExtended lifespans are an important strategy for organ-\nisms in such a variable environment where successful\nrecruitment is intermittent (Murphy et al. 1998; Fraser &\nHofmann 2003; Quetin & Ross 2003). It is therefore not\nsurprising that krill are long lived (above 5 years). Such\nlongevity allows the population to be maintained by 1 or\n2 years of successful recruitment in each 4- or 5-year cycle\n(Murphy et al. 1998; Fraser & Hofmann 2003; Quetin &\nRoss 2003). These cycles in prey availability then generate\nperiodic changes in predator breeding success, which\ngenerate long-term fluctuations in the predator population\ndynamics. The view of an influx of krill into the northern\nScotia Sea ecosystem associated with current systems\n(Priddle et al. 1988; Murphy et al. 1998), and affected\nby climate-driven fluctuations in the ocean, is similar\nto the concept of a translation effect developed for\nC. finmarchicus in the North Atlantic (Pershing et al.\n2004). Such large-scale ecosystem anomaly waves propa-\ngating physically in the oceans and biologically through\nfood webs are likely to be a major component of ecosystem\nvariation throughout the oceans.\nDuring recent decades, there have been more El Nin\u02dco\nthan La Nin\u02dca events, leading to a generally lower than\naverage Southern Oscillation Index. This has prompted an\nactive debate as to whether this change is climate driven\nand how it relates to other modes of climate variation such\nas the SAM that has also shown long-term change (Turner\n2004). Since we have shown that variation across the\nsouthern Pacific affects Atlantic sector ecosystems,\nchanges in the variation in the Pacific and across the\nSouthern Ocean connected with climate change will be\nimportant in determining the long-term ecosystem\ndynamics (Stenseth et al. 2002; Quetin & Ross 2003;\nAinley et al. 2005; Smetacek & Nicol 2005). However,\ndirect effects of climate change in the Scotia Sea may also\nbe important. The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most\nrapidly warming regions on the planet and an area that is\ncrucial in determining the dynamics of Scotia Sea krill\npopulations (Murphy et al. 1998; Fach et al. 2002;\nVaughan et al. 2003; Meredith & King 2005). Warming\naround the Antarctic Peninsula is associated with a\nreduced frequency of cold years of more extensive sea\nice across the Scotia Sea (Murphy et al. 1995; Loeb et al.\n1997; Fraser & Hofmann 2003). Meredith & King (2005)\nalso showed that significant ocean surface warming (over\n18C) has occurred in regions to the west of the Antarctic\nPeninsula over the last 50 years. The significant decline in\nkrill numbers recorded across the Scotia Sea over the last\n30 years (Atkinson et al. 2004) is therefore likely to be the\nClimate impacts on ocean ecosystems E. J. Murphy et al. 3065result of a reduced frequency of successful recruitment\nevents associated with more frequent warm periods.\nHowever, long-term ecological effects resulting from\nharvesting of seals, whales and fishes over more than two\ncenturies will also be occurring (Murphy 1995).\nReliable predictions of future change in complex\necological systems are difficult to make (Sutherland\n2006). However, on the basis of the relationships revealed\nin this study, we would expect that, as a result of regional\nwarming, conditions for dispersing krill across the Scotia\nSea towards South Georgia will occur less frequently in\nthe future. Predictions for the Scotia Sea region are\nnot specifically available, but an increase of approximately\n1\u201328C in SST over the next century is possible and is a\nreasonable basis for prediction. Monte Carlo simulations\nof future change scenarios based on regression models that\nrelate the rate of population growth with biomass or\ndensity in the previous 1 or 2 years and include a single\nenvironmental variable give similar results (table 1, M3\nand M9; see electronic supplementary material for\ndetails). A rate of increase of 18C over the next 100\nyears would result in more than 95% reduction in\nbiomass in approximately 50\u201360 years (probability of\nlocal extinction peZ1.0). For abundance, the density-\ndependent effects are important and indicate that a more\nthan 95% reduction in density could occur in less than\n50 years ( pew0.85). We also ran the models based on\nthe CIs for the parameter values for increase rates of up\nto 28C over the next 200 years. The outcomes indicate a\nhigh level of uncertainty and suggest that local extinction\nmay occur any time throughout next 2 centuries, but\nthe population could be maintained through density-\ndependent effects. The models do not include the direct\neffects of temperature on individual growth rates, analyses\nof which indicate that an increase in SSTof 18C across the\nnorthern Scotia Sea would significantly reduce growth\nrates (Atkinson et al. 2006), potentially further reducing\npopulation viability.\nThe simulations highlight the uncertainty in such\npredictions and indicate a high degree of sensitivity of\nthe system to local warming, with potential catastrophic\neffects on krill and their dependent predators across the\nregion. It should be noted that SST increases of this order\ndo not require large extrapolation of mean values beyond\nthe range of temperatures currently observed (at 34.58W,\n54.58S, the mean SST (September to March)Z1.608C,\nmax.Z3.65, min.ZK0.48, s.d.Z1.24). In reality, the\nresponses of krill populations and their predators to\noceanic temperature change are likely to be highly\nnonlinear. Indeed, the analyses show that potential\ndensity-dependent effects cannot be ignored. For such\noceanic climate-driven local extinction not to occur\nrequires nonlinearities in krill dynamics at low densities,\nsuch that low levels of recruitment do not continue during\nextended periods of high temperature. One possibility is\nthat density-dependent population effects further south,\nin the main region of krill production, may become more\nimportant at low densities of krill. However, on the basis of\nour current understanding of the dynamics of krill\npopulations and model simulations, we suggest that\nfurther regional warming could produce a more than\n95% decline in krill biomass and abundance across the\nScotia Sea during the next 100 years (cf. Atkinson et al.\n2004). Reducing the uncertainty associated with theseProc. R. Soc. B (2007)predictions by developing better mechanistic models of\nkrill life cycles coupled with physical circulation models is\nan urgent requirement.\nWe thank all our colleagues in the British Antarctic Survey\n(BAS) Discovery 2010 Programme for their valuable\ndiscussions.
