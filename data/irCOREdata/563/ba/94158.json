[Taipei: Shiying chubanshe\n(Taiwan Elite), 2001.]\nAs take up of the Internet in China rises toward the 50 million mark,\nspeculation concerning the social and political impact of this new tech-\nnology on the authoritarian state has grown accordingly. While much of\nthe earliest writing on the phenomenon tended to be of a journalistic bent,\ntwo recent reports from US-based think-tanks, RAND and the Carnegie\nEndowment for International Peace, attempt to take the field to a new\nlevel of sophistication. At the same time, the appearance of Chinese\nwriting about the Internet from a variety of perspectives might provide\nmaterial for broadening out the research agenda into new areas of\nsociological inquiry, and beyond the narrow question of whether the\nspread of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) leads to\nliberal political change.\nConsidering how so much of the belief in the potential of the Internet\nto transform authoritarian states has been encouraged by policy-makers\nrather than academics, the strength of both the RAND and Carnegie\nreports lies in the way that they avoid the temptation to exaggerate the\nsignificance of dissident activity in cyberspace. Instead, they pay close\nattention to how the state deters and monitors the Internet through a\ncombination of low-tech and hi-tech methods. In this respect, You\u2019ve Got\nDissent is somewhat the stronger of the two reports because it has enough\nspace to go into detail, while Open Networks only dedicates one chapter\nto China.1 You\u2019ve Got Dissent provides reasonably detailed accounts of\nhow dissidents have been hauled before the authorities and accused of\nvarious activities; lists of the main regulatory principles that have been\nestablished to demarcate what is deemed to be acceptable activity; and an\n1. The other case studies are Cuba, Singapore, Vietnam and Burma, the United Arab\nEmirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\n\uf6d9 The China Quarterly, 2003\n819Review Essay: China and the Internet\noverview of the physical shutdowns of network resources that have\noccurred. Social scientists lacking in technological training should also be\ngrateful for explanations of how methods of control actually work, such\nas the proxy server system and the blocking of email from dissident\nwebsites outside China. With regard to hacking, the reader is even told\nhow to trace culprits back to the Ministry of Public Security in Beijing\n(pp. 74\u201376)! A list of addresses of dissident websites is contained in the\nappendix for those who wish to do some browsing for themselves.\nGiven Chase and Mulvenon\u2019s detailed description of the main practices\nof control and surveillance deployed by the state, however, it is rather\nmystifying why the report should finish on the optimistic note that \u201cthe\nscale of China\u2019s information-technology modernization would suggest\nthat time is eventually on the side of the regime\u2019s opponents\u201d (p. 89).\nAlthough the first half of the book deals with dissident activity in\ncyberspace, it provides no real evidence to suggest that this has been\nsuccessful for political mobilization inside China. Most of the case\nstudies are actually related to overseas groups, and the authors elsewhere\ndescribe how the state is able to block these from penetrating inside\nChina proper. Sometimes links between domestic and overseas activities\nare merely implied. The demonstration organized by the falun gong in\nApril 1999, for example, is juxtaposed with detailed descriptions of the\nmovement\u2019s activities in cyberspace outside China\u2019s firewalls. But no real\nlinkage between these two phenomena is established, other than a foot-\nnote citing a report in the Christian Science Monitor. It could be added\nthat the possibility that the Internet played an important role in the 1999\ndemonstration does not seem to sit well with the report\u2019s own observa-\ntions that most of the participants were elderly females, while 80 per cent\nof Internet users in China are under 35 years of age and 60 per cent are\nmale. The frequent notes of optimism over the liberating potential of the\nInternet that pepper this text do not, therefore, really square with the\nevidence that is presented.\nPerhaps, then, it is a good corrective to read You\u2019ve Got Dissent in\ntandem with Open Networks, because Kalathil and Boas actually set out\nto question the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d that the Internet is a force for\nliberal political change in authoritarian states, by developing \u201ca frame-\nwork that allows for methodological thinking about limited evidence\u201d\n(p. 3). The result is a much broader analysis, ordered under the categories\nof civil society, politics and the state, the economy and the international\nsphere. It is also a more sociological work in the way it locates the\nappropriation of the Internet both in the comparative context of other\nauthoritarian states, and the specific cultural context of the nation-build-\ning project in China. The difference between the conclusions in this work\nand those reached in You\u2019ve Got Dissent is indicated by the title of the\nfinal chapter, Beyond Blind Optimism.\nThe authors of Open Networks thus develop an argument that is both\ncomparatively nuanced and cautious, effectively broadening the debate\nbeyond issues of dissidents-versus-the-state and toward more complex\nissues concerning the relationship between technological and social\n820 The China Quarterly\nchange by highlighting a number of important issues. How, for example,\ncan bureaucratic organizations be developed to build and police the\nInternet, while competition is introduced into the IT sector to make it\ninternationally competitive at the same time? How can the state maintain\ncontrol while informatization be used to boost economic development,\nimprove administrative efficiency, address the digital divide between the\neastern and western provinces? And how can national security be main-\ntained while foreign technology and know-how are adopted on a large\nscale? Within these dynamics, important signs of change can be seen,\nsuch as the erosion of the State Administration of Radio, Film and\nTelevision\u2019s (SARFT) monopoly on news information caused by the turf\nwar between the MII and SARFT due to broadband convergence. Simi-\nlarly, the authors acknowledge the existence of government officials who\nsee informatization as \u201cchanging the very scope and structure of govern-\nment processes\u201d (p. 24). Yet they are also careful to emphasize that\nchange does not necessarily mean democratization, as indicated by the\nhigh salience of nationalistic activity in Chinese cyberspace.\nIf Open Networks is effective in questioning the conventional wisdom,\nthough, the fact that its coverage of China is confined to one chapter\nmakes it rather limited for country specialists and for those interested in\nthe sociology of technology. It is also somewhat puzzling that the authors\nshould feel the need to state that \u201clittle attention has been paid to the issue\nin academia\u201d (p. 3) when their work does in fact owe much to the\nsizeable body of academic literature that has already appeared on the\nsubject of the Internet in China and the sociology of ICTs in general. In\nfact, the movement away from technological determinism took place\nseveral years ago in Internet studies, as the panoply of methods available\nfor the state to stage its counter-revolution began to emerge. Given the\nlarge number of international agreements on data sharing and electronic\nsurveillance to which most states in the world have signed up since 11\nSeptember 2001, or the uncertain fate of the CIA sponsored Triangle Boy\nproject (which was supposed to provide Internet users in authoritarian\nstates with online anonymity), the issue of regulating cyberspace is\ncertainly more pressing than that of using it to bring about regime-change\n\u2013 especially for policy-makers. Give or take a few terrorists, child\npornographers or money launderers, does anybody still believe that a\ncompletely unregulated Internet is a desirable thing?\nDespite such developments, however, seminal works such as Boyle\u2019s\napplication of the Foucauldian Panopticon concept to explain the culture\nof self-surveillance in cyberspace,2 or Lessig\u2019s arguments concerning\nwhether it is possible to regulate cyberspace,3 are either not mentioned or\njust touched on in passing. Considering that Kalathil and Boas wish to\ncritique the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d that the Internet undermines authori-\n2.

Lawrence Lessig, Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace (New York: Basic Books, 1999).\n821Review Essay: China and the Internet\ntarian regimes, they could also have been more critical of the motives of\nthe policy-makers from whom such a view has originated by drawing on\nthe work of writers like Ethan Kapstein.4 However, although Kalathil and\nBoas do not really come to grips with such issues, they do touch on a\nnumber of important areas of research that have been developed in\nInternet studies and pose enough questions to indicate a rich agenda for\nfuture research.\nA good example of one such issue is the relationship between the state,\nChinese commercial Internet firms and foreign firms under WTO rules.\nThis is raised when Kalathil and Boas mention the partnership that has\nbeen established between AOL-Time Warner and Legend, China\u2019s top\nPC manufacturer. To gain further insight into such issues, it might be\nuseful to begin to draw on some of the Chinese literature concerning the\nInternet that is now appearing in abundance. A good example is Lian-\nxiang jituan chuanji 18 nian, the popular biography of Liu Chuanzhi,\nformer president and managing director of Legend Computers, by Song\nHuaijiang, a doctoral graduate of Beijing University. Here the links\nbetween private enterprise and the state are laid out fairly clearly. The\nfirm was established in 1984 with funding from CAS, and quickly\nachieved a domestic monopoly on the technology for inputting and\ndisplaying Chinese characters. With the CAS name behind it, Legend was\nable to raise funds in Hong Kong to enter the international OEM market\nin 1988. In 1994, CAS came to the rescue again by providing a new\ninjection of cash to allow Legend to keep up with the IT boom. The firm\nplays a faithful role in return, having taken a lead in building the\ninfrastructure that makes possible the state\u2019s plans for e-government and\ne-commerce. When the firm launched its global Internet strategy in 1999,\nit chose the ancient capital city of Xi\u2019an for the opening ceremony,\nindicating its commitment to the project of linking the whole of China to\nthe globalization process (p. 228).\nThe most interesting aspect of biographical literature, though, is what\nit tells the reader about the character or the main subject. It is not hard\nto see why Liu should have been considered to be the right person to play\nthe leading role in Legend. Born in 1944, he received his original training\nat the Military Telecommunications Academy in 1961\u201367, then spent a\nyear carrying out defence-orientated research in Chengdu. He moved on\nto CAS in 1970, after his Cultural Revolution spell of agricultural labour\nat Zhuhai, Guangdong (p. 278). When Liu was selected to establish and\nlead the new firm, he was stationed in the cadre section of CAS. By\nMarch 1998 he had been appointed to the National People\u2019s Congress. In\nshort, Liu and his enterprise have been cultivated by the state so that\nLegend can become a member of China\u2019s National Team of very large\nenterprises fit for competition in the global market.\nIt is not surprising then that Liu\u2019s management jargon is fully in tune\nwith the state\u2019s nation-building project. He sums up a vision of his firm\u2019s\n4. Ethan B.

Similarly,\nhis \u201cThree Factors of Management,\u201d namely \u201corganize the troops, fix the\nstrategy, lead the team\u201d (zuzhi tuandui, ding zhanlue, dai duiwu), is\nreminiscent of the slogans imposed on his generation by decades of\npolitical indoctrination. Lenin himself would not have blushed at the idea\nof building a core of leaders who share common ideals, unite to co-oper-\nate and possess the strength to engage in \u201cstruggle.\u201d Mao might well have\nrecognized the call to \u201cfix the strategy\u201d by calling on cadres at all levels\nto be aware of the general situation, consider the long-term, then break\ndown the main objectives into particular tactics while always being able\nto adapt. Deng Xiaoping would have approved of \u201cleading the team\u201d by\ncreating a special culture for the enterprise, consolidating the strength of\nits personnel, creating an atmosphere of professionalism, cultivating\nleaders and establishing a firm base for the future. He would also have\napproved of Liu\u2019s belief that his thinking is distinct from foreign manage-\nment theory due to its emphasis on collective leadership, consensus\nbuilding and the need to enter into a kind of contract with the firm to\nprevent the extremes that might arise from either individual leadership or\nfactionalism (pp. 68\u201370).\nIf Liu Chuanzhi\u2019s story provides interesting insights into the politiciza-\ntion of management theory in the Chinese commercial ICT sector, Ehua\nbudui: weilai guofang wuli, a report on military training by two Tai-\nwanese experts on military affairs, Li Anfu and Song Binggang, illus-\ntrates what happens when informatization leads managerialism to impact\non military doctrine. While much of this work is an exhaustive technical\naccount of the impact of ICTs on military doctrine that is framed mainly\nin the standard literature on the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA),\nthe fifth chapter is most interesting from a sociological point of view\nbecause it deals with the problem of adapting military education and\ntraining during an era of very rapid technological transition. In doing so,\nthe authors divide their subject into sections that deal with the need to\nmake changes to ideas, modes of operation, system building, and cultural\nand psychological factors.\nWhen read alongside Song Huaijiang\u2019s book, however, a striking irony\nemerges as it becomes apparent that military thinkers in Taiwan propose\nthat they can meet the demands of the information revolution by using\nmanagement theory, while a Chinese entrepreneur like Liu Chuanzhi\nbelieves that he can manage his business according to pithy slogans\nreminiscent of CCP propaganda. While Liu envisions his flotilla sailing\nout into the world, Li and Song see the armed forces structuring them-\nselves like commercial enterprises that constantly renew themselves in\norder to survive in the global marketplace. Whereas Liu sees his troops\nadvancing under a collective leadership with himself at the core, Li and\nSong look to Organizational Behaviour theory5 to strike the optimal\n5. They cite Stephen P. Robbins, Organizational Behaviour, p. 228 ff.\n823Review Essay: China and the Internet\nbalance between hierarchy and levelling out, face the conflicts imposed\nwhen the art of strategy clashes with the nature of technology, to establish\na workable relationship between collectivist ideals and individualism, and\nto maintain the continuity of organizations as they go through different\nstages of restructuring.\nPerhaps what is seen in these two books, then, is some kind of erosion\nof the barriers between militaristic and commercial thinking as different\nsocial sectors turn to managerial thinking as they try to address the\ngrowing dependence of organizations on knowledge as a resource and a\ncommodity. The predicaments faced in both sectors are indeed pressing.\nLi and Song illustrate this by citing the examples of Middle Eastern\narmies that have acquired high technology weaponry only to discover that\nthey do not have competent personnel to operate it (p. 271). They find the\nanswer in the establishment of a US-style School of Information Warfare\nand Strategy, and having training systems focusing on long, medium and\nshort-range scenarios, co-ordinated like the hands of a wristwatch\n(p. 277). Liu Chuanzhi, meanwhile, wonders how to foster and retain\ncreative personnel in a mobile labour market with increasing foreign\ncompetition for talent. His answer is to combine recognition and reward\nof individual talent with collective leadership and an appeal to patriotic\nand selfless values.\nThe common problem that unites military and business managers most\nof all is the way in which their growing dependence on technological\nexpertise gives an unprecedented degree of power and status to young\nprofessionals in both the military and civilian sectors. Liu Chuanzhi\nlaments the loss of the ideals of honesty, seeking glory, hard work, thrift\nand patriotism, that were characteristic of the firm\u2019s founding generation.\nAlthough the Spartan spirit is still supposed to be at the core of Legend\u2019s\nvalue system, Liu cannot help but complain about the decline of collec-\ntivist values that began to take place when Legend started to recruit\npersonnel from sources other than CAS back in 1988. Members of this\nnew generation, mainly in their thirties, were more interested in seeking\ntheir own personal glory, were already accustomed to good working\nconditions and were fully aware that they could take up other job\nopportunities if they were not satisfied with the treatment they received\nat Legend. He reminds the new generation of employees that the greater\npart of what they produce should go back to their country, because\nwithout the CAS name behind it, his firm would never have even broken\ninto the OEM market let alone grown to its present size.\nLi and Song, on the other hand, grapple with the problem of how to\nrestructure a hierarchical system in which the senior ranks are technolog-\nically illiterate in comparison with their subordinates. They find the\nanswer in the idea of \u201cpopularized defence\u201d (\u201cguofang shiwu quanmin-\nhua\u201d), which means integrating the civilian and defence industries in\nways that both maximize the cross-fertilization of technologies and allow\nindividuals to develop talents that can develop their own professional\ncareers in the civilian sector while meeting the requirements of the\nmilitary when they are called on. Again, the organizational answer is to\n824 The China Quarterly\nbe found in management theory, which addresses the need for enterprises\nto constantly remake themselves to survive, although Li and Song accept\nthat this kind of constant remaking of the rules will be harder to adjust\nto for Asian societies with collectivist cultures derived from their agricul-\ntural mode of life (pp. 299\u2013300).\nOf course, viewing such issues through the eyes of management theory\nis one way to try to depoliticize what are ultimately highly sensitive\npolitical issues generated by the impact of ICTs. While most of these are\nclosely related to the fate of the authoritarian state that is discussed in\nworks like You\u2019ve Got Dissent and Open Networks, they also cause much\nwider waves, which have to be incorporated into the social science\nresearch agenda. While Open Networks makes a good attempt to develop\nsuch a new agenda, ultimately it is still somewhat limited by the\nself-imposed task of its authors to question the conventional wisdom.\nPerhaps both academics and policy-makers have already moved on to\nmore complex issues, and asking whether the Internet is a force for\nliberalization is now no more appropriate as a question to guide research\nthan is asking whether the printing press is a force for liberalization. The\nanswer for both is yes and no, depending on how the technology is\nappropriated by any particular society. As some of the new Chinese\nliterature indicates, there are also many other phenomena generated by\nthe impact of ICTs in China that are worth studying.\n"}
