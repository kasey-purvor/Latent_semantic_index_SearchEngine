When the Earth\u2019s ionosphere is irradiated by\na radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic wave of sufficiently\nhigh power density and tuned to match a natural E- or\nF-region plasma frequency, ionospheric magnetoionic wave\nmodes may be excited and may generate RF electromag-\nnetic sideband waves via nonlinear interactions. These sec-\nondary emissions, which may then escape from the iono-\nsphere, have been termed stimulated electromagnetic emis-\nsion or SEE. The frequency spectra of this radiation has been\nstudied extensively, and a number of characteristic spectral\nfeatures have been identified and in some cases related to\nparticular plasma processes. The separation in frequency\nbetween the RF pump and the harmonics of the local elec-\ntron gyrofrequency is critical in determining the amount of\nanomalous absorption suffered by the pump wave and the\nspectral properties of the stimulated sidebands. The pump\ncan excite electrostatic waves which do not propagate away\nbut can in some cases be observed via radio-wave scatter-\ning from the electron density fluctuations associated with\nthem. These enhanced density fluctuations are created by\nprocesses commonly referred to as upper-hybrid and Lang-\nmuir turbulence. Langmuir turbulence has been the sub-\nject of 930-MHz scattering observations with antenna scan-\nning through several pre-selected angles between the geo-\ngraphic and geomagnetic zenith directions, and a preference\nfor pointing angles between the Spitze angle and geomag-\nnetic field-aligned was identified. Other phenomena, such as\nthe generation of enhanced electron temperatures and artifi-\ncial aurora, have more recently been shown to have special\nbehavior at similar angles, near but apparently not quite at\nfield-aligned. In view of this evidence for angular structure\nCorrespondence to: B. Isham\n(bisham@bc.inter.edu)\nin several pump-induced effects, in light of the rich variety\nof SEE phenomena strongly dependent on the geomagnetic\nfield via the frequency interval between the pump and the\ngyrofrequency harmonics, and in view of the not yet under-\nstood but complex relationship between electrostatic fluctu-\nations and SEE, it is of interest to investigate experimentally\nwhether a similar angular structure is present in the various\nspectral features of the SEE signals and to compare the re-\nsults with radar and other observations of RF-pump-induced\neffects. To this end we describe a simple two-element ra-\ndio interferometer designed to search for aspect angle depen-\ndence of SEE features. We present an example of the initial\ndata produced by this system, and draw preliminary conclu-\nsions based on the example data.\nKey words.

Coher-\nent radar aspect angle variation and scintillation of satel-\nlite and radio source signals have been used in the past to\nstudy artificially-created field-aligned irregularities at a num-\nber of locations around the world (Frolov, 2003), but work on\nthe aspect angle variation of electron temperature enhance-\nments, Langmuir turbulence, RF-induced optical emissions,\nand stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE) has only\nrelatively recently begun (Isham et al., 1999a, c; Kosch et al.,\n56 B. Isham et al.: Aspect angle dependence of stimulated electromagnetic emission\n2000; Mishin et al., 2001; Pedersen et al., 2003; Rietveld et\nal., 2003; Frolov and Nedzvedski, 2004; Kosch et al., 2004;\nFrolov et al., submitted, 20041). The electron temperature\nand Langmuir turbulence studies have used the European In-\ncoherent Scatter (EISCAT) Scientific Association high fre-\nquency (HF) transmitter and 930-MHz ultra high frequency\n(UHF) and 224-MHz very high frequency (VHF) incoherent\nscatter radars (ISRs) located at Ramfjordmoen near Troms\u00f8,\nNorway; the optical emission measurements have used both\nthe EISCAT Troms\u00f8 facilities and the High-frequency Auro-\nral Active Research Program (HAARP) HF transmitter and\nobservatory near Gakona, Alaska, USA, and the SEE results\ncome from the Sura HF facility near Vasil\u2019sursk, Russia. The\nEISCAT HF facility (69.59 N latitude, 19.23 E longitude)\nhas two low-gain antenna arrays, each capable of transmit-\nting frequency-dependent effective radiated powers (ERPs)\nof about 150 to 330 MW into the ionosphere at frequen-\ncies from 3.8 to 5.7 MHz and from 5.3 to 8.0 MHz, respec-\ntively, and a high-gain array which can transmit about 600 to\n1260 MW ERP between 5.3 and 8.0 MHz, respectively. The\nHAARP facility (62.39 N latitude, 145.15 W longitude) is\ncurrently capable of transmissions between 2.8 and 8.0 MHz\nwith an ERP ranging from about 11 to 170 MW, respectively\n(K. Groves, private communication, 2003). The Sura facil-\nity (56.13 N latitude, 46.10 E longitude) transmits between\n4.3 and 9.5 MHz with a maximum frequency-dependent ERP\nof between 80 and 280 MW, respectively (V. Frolov and\nE. Sergeev, private communications, 2003). The coordinates\nlisted for the various facilities are geographic, and the ERP\nvalues apply to both peak and average power levels. A brief\nsummary of the specifications of several past and present HF\nfacilities is given in chapter four of Belikovich et al. (2002);\nsome of the numbers above have been slightly updated from\nthe values given there.\nIn the aspect angle experiments discussed here it is the\nvariation in look angle from the observer to the region of\nthe ionosphere illuminated by the RF pump beam which is\nimportant. This variation may be achieved by changing the\nangle of observation and, if necessary, in order to illumi-\nnate the region being observed, the angle of the pump beam.\nTypical pump beamwidths are on the order of ten degrees,\nso that adjusting the pump beam angle is not always neces-\nsary. Narrow-beam instruments, such as incoherent scatter\nradars, which typically have beams on the order of one de-\ngree wide, may be scanned within the region illuminated by\nthe pump. Wider-beam instruments, such as imaging cam-\neras, often cover all angles illuminated by the pump without\nany adjustments in pointing.\nBy varying the look angle we are exploring the ef-\nfect of the magnetic field geometry on the physics of the\npump-plasma interaction region. Geometrical parameters\nimportant in ionospheric turbulence experiments include\n1Frolov, V. L., Nedzvetski, D. I., and Komrakov, G. P.: Peculiar-\nities of SEE excitation using an oblique propagating HF powerful\nwave for ionosphere pumping, Izv. VUZov Radiofizika (in Rus-\nsian), (Radiophys. Quant. Elec.), submitted, 2004.\nlook angle, relative altitude within the pump-plasma in-\nteraction region, pump wavelength, and pump polarization\n(Fig. 1). For incoherent scatter observations the radar k vec-\ntor is also important. In backscatter geometry, for example,\nthe radar observes Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves having\nk vector magnitudes equal to twice that of the probing radar.\nThe Langmuir k vector in turn determines an important ref-\nerence height known as the radar matching height, defined as\nthe altitude where twice the k vector of the radar equals the\nk vector of Langmuir waves which follow the Langmuir dis-\npersion relation in the undisturbed background ionosphere\nand have a frequency equal to that of the RF pump. The\nmatching height is thus the location where pump-enhanced\nLangmuir waves following the unperturbed dispersion rela-\ntion may be observed by an incoherent scatter radar. Other\nimportant heights include the critical height, defined as the\naltitude where the frequency of the pump equals the local\ncold plasma frequency, and the upper-hybrid height, where\nthe pump frequency equals the upper-hybrid frequency. The\nradar matching height lies below the critical height and will\nnormally lie above the upper-hybrid height, but, depending\non the radar k vector and the electron temperature, it may also\nfall at or below the upper-hybrid level. The critical height\nis the maximum reflection height for O-mode waves; by this\ndefinition the maximum reflection heights for X- and Z-mode\nwaves may be called the X- and Z-mode critical heights.\nImportant reference angles include geographic zenith (ver-\ntical), geomagnetic zenith (field-aligned), and the Spitze an-\ngle, which lies in between. The Spitze angle marks the end of\nthe Spitze region, defined as the region in which an O-mode\npump wave will reach the critical height before reflecting\ndownward. Outside the Spitze region the pump wave re-\nfracts earthward before reaching the critical height. O-mode\npump polarization is used in the majority of RF interaction\nexperiments, as X mode reflects before reaching either the\nupper-hybrid or critical levels. An important property of the\nO mode is the possibility for it to couple into the Z, or up-\nper branch X, mode, and to thereby propagate through the\nO-mode critical height. This can occur at angles close to the\nSpitze angle (Ellis, 1953, 1956). The pump wavelength de-\ntermines the spacing between the high-power regions in the\ninterference pattern formed below the critical height between\nthe upward propagating pump wave and its reflection, known\nas the Airy pattern (Lundborg and Thide\u00b4, 1985, 1986). Fi-\nnally, recent results suggest that under at least some circum-\nstances the details of the pump beam pattern may be impor-\ntant. For example, Kosch et al. (2002b) report an observation\nin which a patch of stimulated optical emissions followed the\nmotion of the pump beam rather than maintaining its position\nwith respect to the geomagnetic field angle, as had been the\ncase for previous results (Kosch et al., 2000). A unique fea-\nture of the more recent experiment was the use of the EIS-\nCAT high-gain, narrow-beam HF antenna, and this might,\nfor example, indicate that the larger power density gradient\nat the edges of the beam has a role to play in the explanation\nof this result.\nB.

Even\nso, observations of the variation in temperature with aspect\nangle to the geomagnetic field have only recently been made.\nRietveld et al.

The EISCAT HF transmitter was operated in O mode at\n4.544 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of about\n200 MW, with a 15-degree 3-dB full beamwidth and with the\nbeam pointed at 0, 6, and 12-degree zenith angles for a com-\nplete radar angle scan, with a repeating cycle of 8-min on\nand 4-min off.

The behavior of\nthe electron temperature for angles south of field-aligned has\nnot been studied.\n1.2 Langmuir turbulence\nRF-pump-induced Langmuir turbulence occurs in the iono-\nsphere when the electric field of the pump wave drives elec-\ntrons to oscillate nonlinearly along the direction of the geo-\nmagnetic field. This turbulence may be seen by an incoherent\nscatter radar as enhanced scatter from ion-acoustic and Lang-\nmuir modes.\nFigure 2 shows examples of topside ion line enhance-\nments observed on 26 November 1997 with the EISCAT\nUHF and VHF radars (Isham et al., 1999c). In this case\nthe pump frequency was 4.544 MHz, the transmitted power\nwas 160 MW ERP pointed at 6-degree zenith angle (near\nthe Spitze angle) with 15-degree pump beamwidth, and the\ntransmitter cycle was 0.2-s on and 9.8-s off. This observation\nwas motivated by an experiment in August 1986 in which\ntopside enhanced ion lines were observed with the EISCAT\nUHF radar (Isham et al., 1990). In that experiment the pump\nwas operated mostly at 4.04 MHz, 250 MW ERP, normally\npointed at 13-degree zenith angle (near geomagnetic field-\naligned) with 15-degree 3-dB full beamwidth, and was on for\n20, 30, or 40 s every minute. The angle-sensitive Z mode was\nsuggested as a means of propagation to the topside (Seliga,\n1985; Mj\u00f8lhus, 1990), and it was subsequently proposed\n58 B.

Repro-\nduced from Mishin et al. (2001), Fig. 2.\nto study the angle dependence of the topside enhancement,\nand thus of the coupling from the bottomside, using antenna\nscanning. Somewhat surprisingly, as can be seen in Fig. 3,\nit was found that the maximum topside backscattered power\noccurs neither at the Spitze angle nor at field-aligned, but\nsomewhere in between (Mishin et al., 2001). In these mea-\nsurements the antenna did not scan north of the vertical or\nsouth of the geomagnetic field-aligned positions.\nFigure 4 shows plasma line spectra measured on 1 Decem-\nber 1997 at 225 km range in the bottomside ionosphere dur-\ning antenna scanning. The pump operation parameters were\nthe same as on 26 November 1997. The intensities are great-\nest near the field-aligned position of the antenna and nearly\nvanish at vertical. There are two panels in the figure, chirped\nand unchirped. In the unchirped case an unmodulated 128-\u00b5s\npulse was used, while in the chirped case an identical pulse\nwas transmitted, except that the transmission frequency was\nvaried at a temporal rate of \u22124.5 kHz\/\u00b5s, which translates\n12:54\n13:06\n12:57\n13:00\n13:03\n13:09\n13:12\n13:15\n13:18\n\u20134.640 MHz\u20134.490 MHz\nFREQUENCY (bandwidth 1 MHz)\nTI\nM\nE \n(U\nT)\nCHIRPED\n(chirprate \u201330 kHz\/km) UNCHIRPED\n2.28\n1.00\nSIG\nNAL-TO\n-NO\nISE\nHFOL\nHFPL\nHFOL\nHFPL\nIsham et al.

The spectra are most intense\nin the vicinity of the field-aligned position of the antenna, which in\nthis example occurred at 13:00 to 13:01 and 13:12 to 13:13 UT. In\nboth panels the right-hand line is the normal HF-enhanced plasma\nline, while the left-hand line is the free mode or outshifted line,\nshifted away from the radar transmission frequency, towards more\nnegative frequencies for these downshifted waves. This effect was\nmeasured at HF pump frequencies of 4.9128 MHz, 4.544 MHz (the\ndata shown here), and 4.040 MHz. Reproduced from Isham et\nal. (1999c), Fig. 3.\nin the ionosphere to a geometrical rate of \u221230 kHz\/km. The\nfrequency scale of the chirped channel is thus linked to range.\nDuring scanning, features at a fixed altitude will vary in range\nand therefore also in frequency in the chirped spectrum. This\nvariation of frequency with scan angle is apparent in the fig-\nure. Reversing this logic, we find that the larger frequency\nseparation between the outshifted and normal RF-enhanced\nlines in the chirped vs. unchirped channels indicates that the\nvolume of origin of the outshifted line lies slightly below\nthat of the normal RF-enhanced line. The range resolution,\n333 m in this case, is determined by the frequency resolution\n(10 kHz) divided by the chirp rate (30 kHz\/km) (Isham et al.,\n1999b).\nBased on Fig. 4 it is possible to say that the bottomside\nplasma line enhancement is strongest near field-aligned, but\nit is not possible to say whether this maximum occurs exactly\nat field-aligned or perhaps some degrees offset from it, as is\ntrue for the topside ion line enhancements. Also, as the scan\nB. Isham et al.: Aspect angle dependence of stimulated electromagnetic emission 59\nHF pump beam\nSpitze angle\nfield-\naligned\nIsham et al. Figure 5\nFig. 5. Airglow at 630.0 nm between the Spitze and geomagnetic field-aligned positions. These positions are indicated for 230-km altitude\nby the black squares; the circle indicates the half-power contour of the pump beam, which was centered on the zenith. Adapted from Kosch\net al. (2000), Fig. 2.\nwas performed only to the field-aligned position, it is un-\nknown whether the true maximum, or perhaps even a second\nmaximum, might occur south of field-aligned. In September\n2002 EISCAT UHF ion line observations were made at an-\ngles of about 6 and 12\u25e6 north and south of field-aligned and\nat field-aligned during 2-min on, 2-min off, O-mode pump-\ning at 7.1 MHz (between the fifth and sixth gyroharmonics).\nThe results show strong enhanced returns at 6\u25e6 south of field-\naligned (Dhillon and Robinson, 2005). This is consistent\nwith EISCAT UHF ion line data from November 2001, in\nwhich the antenna was scanned to 15\u25e6 south (about 2\u25e6 past\nfield-aligned) during O-mode pumping at 5.423 MHz (near\nthe fourth gyroharmonic). The data indicate that there is a\nsecond ion line enhancement maximum on the bottomside\nsouth of field-aligned. Simultaneous optical observations\nsuggest that these maxima may be two points on a ring of\nenhancements circling the field line (Kosch et al., 2004). Op-\ntical measurements are discussed in more detail below.\n1.3 Optical emissions\nThe peculiar role played by the field-aligned direction is also\napparent in observations made on 21 February 1999 of O(1D)\n630.0-nm and on 3 February 2002 of O(1D) 630.0-nm and\nO(1S) 557.7-nm RF-induced optical emissions, at EISCAT\nand HAARP, respectively (Kosch et al., 2000; Pedersen et al.,\n2003). This type of pump-induced emission is also known as\nartificial airglow or artificial aurora. Figure 5 shows such\nobservations, together with the half-power contour of the\npump beam (assuming no refraction) and the intersections\nof the field-aligned and Spitze directions starting from, and\nat an altitude of 230 km above, the EISCAT HF transmit-\nter. The HF transmitter was operated in O-mode at 4.04 MHz\nwith an effective radiated power (ERP) of about 70 MW, ver-\ntical pointing with 15-degree 3-dB full beamwidth, and with\na repeating cycle of 4-min on and 4-min off. The Spitze an-\ngle was computed using the 4.04-MHz pump frequency. The\ndata show that the region of artificial emissions is shifted\naway from the beam center and toward the field-aligned di-\nrection in a fashion similar to the shift of the pump-induced\nLangmuir waves observed by the EISCAT UHF radar, as pre-\nviously described. The HAARP experiment, which produced\nsimilar results, used O mode at transmission frequencies of\n4.8 and 5.8 MHz with continuous full power (about 60 and\n90 MW ERP, respectively), with a 20-point pump beam az-\nimuth scan at 15-degree zenith angle, and with a dwell time\nof 30 s at each point in the scan.\nSubsequent observations at EISCAT on 12 November\n2001 at 5.423 MHz, near the fourth gyroharmonic, revealed\na ring structure in pump-enhanced emissions at 630.0 nm,\n557.7 nm, and in white light, which after about two minutes\ncollapsed into the filled circle typical of all previous obser-\nvations (Jussila, 2002; Kosch et al., 2002b, 2004). Enhanced\nemission from N+2 at 427.8 nm was also detected, although\n60 B. Isham et al.: Aspect angle dependence of stimulated electromagnetic emission\nnot imaged (Holma et al., submitted, 20042). The ERP was\n550 MW with a 7.5-degree 3-dB full beamwidth, pump beam\nscanning between zenith angles of 3\u25e6 north to 15\u25e6 south, and\na repeating transmission cycle of 2-min on, 2-min off. The\nring structure points to a geometrical effect, but equally sig-\nnificant is the fact that the structure was not fixed at a par-\nticular angle but remained centered in the pump beam for all\nof the imaged wavelengths while the beam was scanned. A\nmajor difference between the November 2001 observations\nand other high-latitude observations is that the pump ERP is\nroughly five times greater, and this may allow the geometri-\ncal properties of the pump beam, in particular the magnitude\nand gradient of the pump electric field, to dominant over the\ngeometry of the magnetized ionospheric plasma.\nThe excitation of 630.0-nm emissions requires a source\nof energetic electrons having energies above 1.96 eV. Af-\nter accounting for electron energy loss processes, the effec-\ntive O(1D) excitation energy in the F region becomes ap-\nproximately 3 eV; for 557.7-nm O(1S) emissions the corre-\nsponding values are 4.17 eV and approximately 6 eV (Bern-\nhardt et al., 1989). Excitation of N+2 first negative 427.8-nm\nemissions requires electron energies of 19.8 eV, assuming no\nlosses (Stolarski et al., 1967). RF pump-enhanced optical\nemissions from neutral N2, in the N2 first positive band at\n660 nm and requiring electron energies of 7.3 eV, assuming\nno losses (Stolarski et al., 1967), have been reported in the E\nregion above Arecibo, Puerto Rico, using a pump frequency\nof 3.175 MHz (Djuth et al., 1999). At Arecibo the geomag-\nnetic field has a zenith angle of about 45\u25e6, a significantly dif-\nferent geometry than in the higher-latitude locations where\nthe scanning observations discussed here have been carried\nout (Isham et al., 2000). Evidence for the existence of en-\nergetic electrons accelerated during RF pumping is also pro-\nvided by Arecibo incoherent scatter radar (ISR) observations\nof RF-enhanced natural plasma lines (Carlson et al., 1982;\nGurevich et al., 2000).\nPump-induced plasma turbulence holds promise as a\nsource of energetic electrons. Such turbulence can consist\nof either Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves (Langmuir turbu-\nlence) or upper and lower hybrid waves (upper-hybrid turbu-\nlence). Previous studies, based on SEE, anomalous absorp-\ntion, and electron temperature measurements, indicate that\nthere is a minimum in the level of upper-hybrid excitation at\nthe gyroharmonic frequencies (Stubbe et al., 1994; Robinson\net al., 1996; Frolov et al., 1998, 2001; Mj\u00f8lhus, 1998). More\nrecently, both airglow and coherent backscatter radar signals\nhave been shown to vanish when the pump frequency is tuned\nto the third gyroharmonic (Kosch et al., 2002a), supporting\nthe role of upper-hybrid turbulence as the source of the en-\nergetic electrons. However, measurements near the fourth\ngyroharmonic show strong pump-induced airglow, suggest-\ning, in the absence of upper-hybrid turbulence, that Lang-\nmuir turbulence must have been the mechanism responsible\n2Holma, H., Kaila, K. U., Kosch, M. J., and Rietveld, M. T.:\nRecognizing the blue emission in artificial aurora, Adv. Space Res.,\nsubmitted, 2004.\nfor accelerating the electrons (Kosch et al., 2004). Whether\nboth of these conclusions are valid, or if they apply under\ndifferent conditions, has not yet been determined.\n1.4 Stimulated electromagnetic emission\nStimulated radiofrequency electromagnetic emission, or\nSEE, is a rich and complex phenomenon with intimate con-\nnections to striations and turbulent processes (Leyser, 2001).\nThe geomagnetic field plays a dominant role in SEE, and\nthe morphology of the SEE spectrum depends dramatically\non the proximity of the pump frequency to a harmonic of\nthe local electron gyrofrequency (Frolov et al., 2001). These\nproperties of SEE strongly suggest that features in the SEE\nspectrum must in all probability also depend on geomagnetic\naspect angle.\nThe importance of the gyroharmonic frequencies was em-\nphasized by Stubbe et al. (1994), who divided SEE features\ninto two general classifications: gyrofeatures, which appear\nonly when the pump is in the vicinity of an electron gyrohar-\nmonic frequency, and universal features, which may appear\nat most or all ionospheric pump frequencies. In general, the\ndetailed morphology of any given SEE feature will change\nas the pump frequency is varied (Frolov et al., 2001). Dis-\ntinctions may also be made between steady-state and tran-\nsient features, and between features seen under unprecon-\nditioned as opposed to preconditioned pumping conditions.\nMost reported results are for the steady state, which results\nfrom pumping at a high enough average pump power to cre-\nate and sustain small-scale artificial field-aligned irregulari-\nties. In particular, small-scale irregularities, which form near\nthe upper-hybrid level, are known to be intimately associated\nwith SEE, and, under these circumstances, upper-hybrid tur-\nbulence is thought to be important in the SEE generation pro-\ncess. When irregularities remain from a previous pump-on\nperiod and are present at the start of a new pump turn-on, the\nsituation is known as preconditioned. For unpreconditioned\nobservations, before artificial irregularities have developed,\nand also near the gyroharmonics, where upper-hybrid turbu-\nlence and artificial irregularities are known to be suppressed,\nLangmuir turbulence is suspected to be dominant. This is\nthought to be the case for the fast narrow continuum (FNC)\n(Leyser, 2001) and the first component of the broad upshifted\nmaximum (BUM1) (Frolov et al., 1998), respectively.\nA schematic overview of the behavior of many of the ma-\njor steady-state features in the SEE spectrum as a function\nof pump frequency relative to the fourth and higher gyrohar-\nmonic frequencies is shown in Fig. 6. Steady-state features\nwhich may be seen primarily or only at the third gyrohar-\nmonic include the downshifted peak (DP) and the broad sym-\nmetrical structure (BSS), respectively (Stubbe and Kopka,\n1990), whose spectral variations in the vicinity of the third\nharmonic are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The variation of the\ndownshifted maximum (DM), the upshifted maximum (UM),\nand the broad upshifted maxima 1 and 2 (BUM1 and BUM2)\nnear the fourth gyroharmonic, are shown in Fig. 9. Note the\nwide variation in frequency offsets of the various spectral\nB. Isham et al.: Aspect angle dependence of stimulated electromagnetic emission 61\nfeatures, and that the emissions may be downshifted, up-\nshifted, or both simultaneously, relative to the RF pump fre-\nquency.\nAlthough many theoretical explanations have been ad-\nvanced, the generation of SEE is still not well-understood.\nIt is likely that the various spectral features have different\norigins, and that these differences have an influence on the\ndirection of arrival of the associated waves.\nTo date, most SEE measurements have been carried out\nat locations nearly directly under the RF interaction region,\nand no thorough studies of SEE versus angle of arrival have\nbeen reported (Leyser, 2001). Carozzi et al. (2001) measured\nthe polarization state of SEE and concluded that some spec-\ntral components have oblique incidence, suggesting the pos-\nsibility of separate source regions for different components.\nGurevich et al. (2002), quoting V. Frolov (private commu-\nnication), report that a significant intensification of the SEE\ndownshifted maximum was observed at a pump frequency\nof 5.6 MHz when the pump beam was turned from vertical\nto magnetic field-aligned. Frolov et al. (submitted, 20041)\ndiscuss measurements of the SEE broad upshifted maximum\nmade while the direction of the RF pump beam was scanned\nin the geomagnetic field plane between +16 and \u221216\u25e6 from\nvertical.\n2 Technique\nSEE was discovered and has most often been measured us-\ning a spectrum analyzer connected to an HF receiving an-\ntenna (Thide\u00b4 et al., 1982; Stubbe et al., 1984). Although\nspectrum analyzers provide only moderate (several-second)\ntime resolution, they have the large, 120-dB or greater dy-\nnamic range sometimes required to detect the weak SEE\nsignals lying near the ionospherically-reflected (and possi-\nbly ground-path-propagated) pump wave, which may have\n100-dB-greater power than the SEE sidebands.\nOn the other hand, modern digital data-taking systems pro-\nvide the best possible time resolution. In addition, these sys-\ntems can be designed to record raw voltage samples, a feature\nwhich allows for the possibility of multi-channel interferom-\netry. However, the dynamic range of digital systems is lim-\nited by the number of bits available in their analog-to-digital\nconverters (ADCs). Current digital systems typically use 14-\nbit ADCs, which provide 78 dB of dynamic range; additional\ndynamic range may be obtained through the use of a filter to\nnotch out the pump frequency. Alternatively, more bits may\nbe sampled. At least one 23-bit system is in use for SEE ob-\nservations, providing 132 dB of dynamic range (Carozzi et\nal., 2002). Such systems are ideal, but expensive.\nA coherent four-channel 14-bit digital receiver has been\nconstructed by the Polar Geophysical Institute in Murmansk,\nRussia. The receiver frequency is tunable between 1.5 and\n32 MHz, with a 1.875-MHz complex sampling frequency\nand a 350-kHz hardware-limited data bandwidth. Uninte-\ngrated SEE spectra with 915.5-Hz frequency resolution and\n1.082-ms time resolution, for example, may be achieved\nPu\nm\np \nFr\neq\nue\nnc\ny \n( f\npu\nm\np)\nFrequency\nn fc\n~0\n.2\n f c\n~0\n.1\n f c\nfpump\n~(n + 0.2) fc\n~(n + 0.1) fc\nFig. 6.

The pump frequency\nis different in each panel, as indicated on the vertical axis; how-\never, the horizontal frequency scales of the individual panels have\nbeen shifted so that the different pump frequencies are aligned,\nas indicated on the bottom horizontal axis. In this way the dif-\nferences in the nature of the SEE spectra as a function of offset\nfrom the pump can be illustrated as a function of changing pump\nfrequency relative to the fourth and higher gyroharmonic frequen-\ncies. The features shown on this diagram are the broad contin-\nuum (BC), downshifted maximum (DM), broad upshifted structure\n(BUS), downshifted maximum first cascade (2DM), slow narrow\ncontinuum (SNC), upshifted maximum (UM), and broad upshifted\nmaximum (BUM); note that the BUM marked in this figure is the\nBUM2 (Frolov et al., 1998). Adapted from Leyser (2001), Fig. 32.\nby processing 2048-point complex voltage data vectors.\nThe system is designed to be expanded from four to eight\nchannels.\n62 B. Isham et al.: Aspect angle dependence of stimulated electromagnetic emission\nIsham et al. Figure 7\nFig. 7. The behavior of the downshifted peak (DP) near the third gyroharmonic. Note that the frequency scale is just a few kHz wide. These\ndata were taken using the Troms\u00f8 HF facility in November 1989. Reproduced from Stubbe and Hagfors (1997), Fig. 15.\nFor the simplest interferometric observations of coherence\nand cross phase, two channels may be connected to two sim-\nple spaced HF electric dipole antennas. If four dipoles are\navailable, a measure of the polarization dependence of the\nresults may be included by arranging antennas in pairs of or-\nthogonal polarizations at the two locations and connecting\nthem to four receiver channels. Alternatively, three antennas\ncould be used to measure angular variation on two baselines,\nfor example, north-south and east-west, thus determining a\nunique point of origin of the signal in the sky.\nThe above procedures all use the phase of the cross spec-\ntrum between antenna pairs to find the signal-weighted av-\nerage position of the SEE source region in the plane of the\nantenna baseline. Since the interferometer pair will be look-\ning at signals originating in the region of the ionosphere illu-\nminated by the pump beam, the angle between interferomet-\nric fringes, that is, the angle between position angles with\npath length differences of exactly one wavelength, must be\ngreater than the full beamwidth of the HF pump antenna.\nFor example, the EISCAT low-gain HF antenna arrays have\na full beamwidth of 15\u25e6 at the 3-dB points, so that a two-\nelement SEE antenna spacing which results in interference\nfringes greater than 15\u25e6 apart is required for the proposed\nmeasurements. However, since RF-induced phenomena may\noccur at pump power levels far below \u22123 dB relative to the\nmaximum effective radiated power density of the pump an-\ntenna pattern, the distance between fringes should in practice\nbe several times greater than indicated by the 3-dB points of\nthe pump beam pattern alone.\nA useful guide to a practical maximum in the fringe spac-\ning is the width of the beam pattern of the individual ele-\nments in an interferometer pair. For example, for a cen-\nter frequency of 5.468 MHz and free-space wavelength of\n54.86 m, commercially-available 27.43-m-long folded full-\nwave dipoles might be used. Assuming such a dipole is\nmounted horizontally approximately 4.5 m above the ground,\nthe dipole pattern will have \u22123-dB points at zenith angles of\nabout \u00b130\u25e6 along the dipole axis and \u00b145\u25e6 perpendicular to\nit. Within the band of commonly available RF pump frequen-\ncies (roughly 3 to 10 MHz) the dipole pattern changes very\nlittle; in addition, these figures depend very little on the exact\nmounting height above the ground.\nBased on the above example, we might desire 100\u25e6 be-\ntween fringes, a little more than half the sky. To achieve\nthis, the spacing of the antenna pairs should be on the or-\nder of one pump wavelength. For example, 50-m antenna\nspacing would provide a geometrical fringe spacing of about\n100\u25e6 at 4 MHz and about 50\u25e6 at 8 MHz. As discussed in the\nIntroduction, variations in RF-induced phenomena have pre-\nviously been measured with angular resolutions of about 3\u25e6,\nB. Isham et al.: Aspect angle dependence of stimulated electromagnetic emission 63\nIsham et al. Figure 8\nFig. 8. The behavior of the broad symmetrical structure (BSS) near\nthe third gyroharmonic. These data were taken using the Troms\u00f8\nHF facility on 9 November 1989, 15:02 to 15:58 UT. Reproduced\nfrom Stubbe and Hagfors (1997), Fig. 16.\nand for improved measurements we might desire 1-degree\nresolution. At 100\u25e6 fringe spacing, this would then corre-\nspond to 100 points across the sky, or, since there are 360\u25e6 of\ncross phase between fringes, for 1-degree spatial resolution\nwe should have a phase resolution of one point per 3.6\u25e6 of\ninterferometric cross phase. For the steady-state SEE obser-\nvations discussed here a time resolution of ten seconds would\nbe acceptable, which, for the example above with 1.082-ms\ntime resolution, would allow nearly ten thousand integrations\nper phase measurement. Given the typically good signal-\nto-noise characteristics of SEE spectra, it is expected that\n100 points across the phase spectrum may easily be resolved.\nIn the past, interferometry between antenna pairs has been\ncarried out by looking for variations in the strengths of the\nsums and differences of the signals from two antennas while\nscanning an interference null across the region of interest. In\nour case scanning of the interference pattern might be done\nby adjusting the phase angle between the two sample streams\nDM\nBUM1\nBUM2\n2BUM2\nDM\nBUM1 BUM2\nIsham et al.

This tech-\nnique depends sensitively on having identical gains in the\ntwo channels, which can also be adjusted by applying cal-\nibration adjustments to the sample streams. However, with\nincreases in available computing power, the cross-correlation\ntechnique, which has the advantage of having an algorithm\nwhich can process all the available data in one operation, has\nbecome more practical.\nAs discussed above, for the simplest interferometric ob-\nservations, the required spacing of the antenna pairs will be\non the order of one pump wavelength. More complicated an-\ntenna geometries designed for radio imaging could make use\nof many dipoles arranged on multiple-wavelength baselines\nand sampled on individual raw data channels. This arrange-\nment, given a suitable distribution of baselines, would re-\nmove the signal-weighted average-position limitation of the\ncross-phase technique.\n64 B.

Figure 10Fig. 10. SEE data during aspect angle scanning of the RF pump\nbeam along the magnetic meridian. Time is in UT (local time mi-\nnus one hour). The pump frequency is 5.473 MHz, near the fourth\ngyroharmonic. The SEE spectra have been integrated for 1 min 45 s\nduring the 2-min pump-on period.\n3 Observations\nAn early indication of the possible dependence of SEE on\naspect angle can be seen in low time resolution SEE data\ntaken at EISCAT on 12 November 2001, using a single dipole\nantenna connected to a spectrum analyzer system during a\nperiod in which the beam of the EISCAT HF facility was\nscanned in 3-degree steps between 15\u25e6 south and 3\u25e6 north\n(see Fig. 10). The pump was operated at 5.423 MHz at about\n550 MW ERP with 7.5-degree 3-dB full beamwidth, with a\ntransmitter cycle of 2-min on, 1-min off. The data show the\nBUM2 to be especially peaked between 3 and 9\u25e6 south, with\nthe closest approach of the BUM2 to the pump frequency oc-\ncurring at about 9\u25e6 south. As previously noted, ISR and op-\ntical data measured near Troms\u00f8 show special behavior near\n9\u25e6 south, also not directly along the geomagnetic field.\nHowever, this result is inconclusive as there is only one\nexample, and as changes in the ionosphere might produce\nthe same effect. For example, the pump frequency was near\nthe fourth gyroharmonic, and if the ionosphere were to drift\nnear or through the local gyroharmonic frequency at just the\ntime when the pump beam was moving from 9 to 6 to 3\u25e6\nsouth, then a similar result might be seen (see Figs. 9 and 6).\nIncoherent scatter and ionosonde data show that the critical\nheight corresponding to 5.423 MHz was changing near the\ntime when this SEE data was taken, but they do not have ade-\nquate resolution to determine how the relation to the gyrohar-\nmonic might have changed during the period of the antenna\nscan. On the other hand, the downshifted and upshifted max-\nima (DM and UM) also appear in the spectra, for all point-\ning angles. Although the DM appears weak in some of the\nplots, the UM is still present, and in past observations the\nDM has never failed to be present when the UM is present\n(Leyser, 2001). This indicates that the gyroharmonic was\nnot reached during the period shown in Fig. 10. Furthermore,\nthe BUM2 feature appears about 50 kHz from the pump fre-\nquency, distinguishing it from the BUM1 and indicating that\nthe pump frequency lies approximately 50 kHz above the gy-\nroharmonic (Leyser et al., 1989; Stubbe and Kopka, 1990;\nFrolov et al., 1998) (see Fig. 9).\nThe SEE interferometer system described here was first\noperated at the Sura HF facility during March 2004. Un-\nfortunately, SEE signals were relatively weak and the re-\nsults to date are inconclusive. A second campaign was car-\nried out during late September and early October 2004, us-\ning the EISCAT HF facility at Ramfjordmoen near Troms\u00f8,\nNorway, and strong SEE signals were seen. During that\ncampaign the SEE system was located at Ramfjordmoen\n15 km away from the HF pump transmitter, and voltages\nwere normally recorded from three antennas. The antennas\nwere three 27.43-m-long folded full-wave dipoles mounted\nas discussed in the example in the previous section, that\nis, horizontally approximately 4.5 m above the ground with\nthe antenna axes aligned in the east-west direction, with\nbaselines of 50.2 m east-west and 55.6 m north-south. An\nidentical fourth antenna provided an alternative north-south\nbaseline of 106.2 m, and this was sometimes used. As\nB.

For these measurements a white noise source was divided into the three receiver channels and\ndata was recorded simultaneously in all three. Because of this, the fluctuations in the different channels are nearly identical, and the blue\ntrace (channel 1) is, for example, nearly perfectly hidden behind the green trace (channel 2) in the lower left panel. The red trace (channel 3)\nis about 3.5 dB below the other two due to differences in the signal paths. The filters have 3-dB points at about \u00b11 kHz from the center\nfrequency.

The BUM1 can be clearly seen, but the DM, which is\npresent, is obscured by the interfering signal. Panels three and four show the coherence and cross phase along the north-south path, and the\nbottom two panels show the elevation and azimuth angles computed from the cross phase of the north-south and east-west antenna pairs.\nAzimuth is measured from geographic north and ranges from 90 (due east) through 180 (geographic south) to 270 (due west), while elevation\nranges from 0 (on the southern horizon) through 90 (vertical) to 180 (on the northern horizon), although only elevations from 50 to 110 are\nplotted. These scales were chosen in order to show any signals from north of vertical on a continuous scale with signals from the south. The\ndata were recorded in 4-s-long files, with a 2- to 4-s data gap between files. The time and frequency resolutions in this figure are 1 s and\n1 kHz, respectively.\nB. Isham et al.: Aspect angle dependence of stimulated electromagnetic emission 67\nData from the recent EISCAT campaign are still in the\nearly stages of processing, but an example which illustrates\nthe technique is presented in Fig. 12. At the time this data\nwas recorded, the RF pump was operating in O mode at\n5.423 MHz in a repeating cycle of 2-min on, 2-min off. The\npump beam width was approximately 7.5\u25e6 and the effective\nradiated power (ERP) was about 700 MW. During the first\npump-on, at 10:56 UT, the HF beam was pointed at 14.0\u25e6\nsouth of geographic zenith; during the following two, begin-\nning at 11:00 UT and 11:04 UT, the pump was oriented 17.5\u25e6\nsouth. These positions corresponded to elevation angles of\n76 and 72.5\u25e6. The SEE receiving site was located approxi-\nmately 15 km north of the EISCAT HF transmitter. No notch\nfilters were used during the period shown in this example.\nThe top two panels of Fig. 12 show the SEE power spec-\ntrum vs. time, as recorded by the central antenna. The first\npanel shows the pump and a strong interfering signal; in the\nsecond panel the first component of the broad upshifted max-\nimum (BUM1) is clearly seen between about 15 and 60 kHz\nabove the pump frequency. The strong interfering signal\nobscures the downshifted maximum (DM), which is also\npresent during this time period. This combination of features\nindicates that the pump frequency is about 5 kHz above the\nlocal gyroharmonic (see Fig. 9). The third panel of Fig. 12\nshows the coherence between the north and south antennas.\nThere are many regions of high coherence, including regions\nof cosmic noise and of man-made interference, as well as\nthe regions where the BUM1 feature is located. The fourth\npanel shows the cross phase, and clearly indicates regions of\nconstant phase corresponding to the BUM1. The bottom two\npanels show the elevation and azimuth as computed from the\ncross phases of the north-south and east-west antenna pairs.\nFurther details of the BUM1 are shown in Fig. 13, which\nhas a more selective frequency scale. The elevation angle\ncorresponding to the BUM1 is about 74\u25e6 during the pumping\ncycle at 10:56 UT and about 70\u25e6 during the cycles at 11:00\nand 11:04 UT. It is particularly interesting that the variation\nin the angle of the SEE source region as seen by the inter-\nferometer reflects the variation in the direction of the pump\nbeam, 76 and 72.5\u25e6, respectively, as described in the preced-\ning paragraph. The azimuth angle is in the vicinity of 200\u25e6,\nnot exactly north-south; variation in azimuth angle is also on\nthe order of the change in pump beam direction, but does not\nappear to correlate with the pump-beam-swinging pattern.\nIt is interesting to compare the BUM1 in Fig. 13 with\nDM data, shown in Fig. 14. When coherence is high, the\nelevation angle for the DM appears to be about 77\u25e6 during\nthe pumping cycle at 10:56 UT and about 73\u25e6 during the\ncycles at 11:00 and 11:04 UT, suggesting that the source\nregion of the DM, too, is responding to the motion of the\npump beam. However, the value of the elevation angle\nappears to be sensitive in some way to the magnitude of the\ncoherence, and this remains to be investigated in detail. The\nazimuth angle of the DM, about 205\u25e6, is similar and arguably\nequal to that of the BUM1 within the apparent range of\nfluctuations in the measured values. As with the BUM1, the\nazimuth is not aligned north-south and varies within a range\nof several degrees but in no obviously discernable pattern.\nThe coherences of both the BUM1 and DM appear to de-\ncrease, by 10 or 20 or greater percentages, during the course\nof the 2-min pump-on periods. This decrease in coherence\nis mainly gradual and apparently repeatable. The coherence\nof the DM is much more variable than that of the BUM1,\nand appears to have a dependence on the orientation of the\nantenna baseline.\nThe data used to produce these results were calibrated, us-\ning data such as that shown in Fig. 11, to correct for distor-\ntions in the amplitude and phase of the measurement system.\nHowever, these are preliminary data, and all possible factors\nwhich might affect the computed angles may not yet have\nbeen taken into consideration. Furthermore, the data exam-\nined so far are a small sample. These results should therefore\nnot be taken as final, but as preliminary calculations which\nmay need revising as more data is processed.\n4 Discussion\nAs described above, RF-pump-enhanced incoherent scatter\nion and plasma lines have been observed in the topside iono-\nsphere above Troms\u00f8 (Isham et al., 1990, 1999a, c). The\nmechanism by which this occurred was ascribed by the ob-\nservers to the conversion of the originally transmitted O-\nmode pump wave into the Z mode, which may subsequently\npenetrate the ionosphere to either the Z-mode critical height\nor to the topside O-mode critical height (Ellis, 1953, 1956;\nMj\u00f8lhus and Fla\u02da, 1984; Seliga, 1985; Mj\u00f8lhus, 1990). Dur-\ning this observation the F-region peak frequency (foF2) was\nless than the Z-mode critical frequency, so that Z-mode\nwaves were able to reach the topside and might have ex-\ncited instabilities at or near the topside critical level (where\nthe RF pump frequency equals the topside local cold plasma\nfrequency) and thereby created the observed enhanced ion-\nacoustic and Langmuir waves. At least one other topside\nexcitation mechanism has been suggested, namely the trans-\nmission of power through the F region via pump-modulated\nkinetic tunneling of electrons (Eliasson, 2001; Revenchuk et\nal., 2001).\nIn the Z-mode scenario, for a horizontally stratified\nmedium one would expect the pump wave to penetrate the\ncritical height at the Spitze angle and to be limited to a nar-\nrow angular window, making it likely that the topside plasma\nturbulence feature be of a limited lateral extent along the\nmagnetic meridian plane. This was one of the original mo-\ntivations for the ISR antenna scanning experiment. Figure 1\ngives a sketch of the various possible propagation paths for\nthe situation where the electron density is high enough for\nthe Z mode to be reflected. The topside echo would then be\nabsent, if the Z-mode explanation of the topside echoes is\nthe correct one. An observation under these conditions could\nbe used as a test for distinguishing between the Z mode and\nkinetic tunneling mechanisms.\n68 B.

This is the same time period as in Fig. 12 but with an\nexpanded view of the frequency scale encompassing the BUM1, and showing the coherences for all three antenna baselines plus elevation\nand azimuth angles computed for the BUM1 source region. The elevation angle of the BUM1 is about 74\u25e6 during the pump cycle beginning\nat 10:56 UT and about 70\u25e6 during the follow two cycles. Time and frequency resolutions are 1 s and 1 kHz.\nLangmuir turbulence may be subdivided into cascading\nand cavitating regimes (sometimes loosely referred to, re-\nspectively, as weak and strong turbulence). Both of these\nmay be observed using incoherent scatter radars, cascad-\ning turbulence at the radar matching height and cavitating\nturbulence near the critical height (Robinson, 1997). For\nLangmuir turbulence to be excited in a magnetized plasma,\nthe pump must drive electrons along or closely aligned to\nthe direction of the ambient magnetic field. At the critical\nlevel the pump electric field is parallel to the geomagnetic\nfield and should therefore excite cavitating turbulence, which\nshould be observable by both the EISCAT 224-MHz (VHF)\nB.

Computed ray paths and electric field polarizations of an RF pump wave in a smooth ionosphere at the EISCAT VHF radar matching\nheight (hvhf), the upper-hybrid resonance height (huh), and the EISCAT UHF radar matching height (huhf). The ray paths are shown for\nangles between \u221215 and +15\u25e6 from vertical (\u03b8v = 0\u25e6) in the magnetic meridian plane at the EISCAT site near Troms\u00f8, Norway. The\nplasma density profile is given in units of X = (fpe\/fhf)2, where fpe is the cold plasma frequency and fhf is the HF, or RF, pump frequency.\nThe plasma frequency gradient equals 30 kHz\/km at the critical height (hpe), here chosen to be 225 km for an O-mode pump frequency\nof 4.544 MHz. These parameters match those of the data shown in Figs. 2 and 4. A parabolic density profile was assumed, producing an\nfoF2 of 4.9 MHz at 250 km altitude. The electron gyroharmonic frequency is 1.33 MHz and the geomagnetic field angle (\u03b8B ) is 12.9\u25e6 from\nvertical. The Spitze angle (\u03b8S) is then 6.1\u25e6. The matching heights were computed assuming an electron temperature of 2000 K. As the\nelectron temperature decreases the matching heights rise; at an electron temperature of 1050 K the VHF matching height would lie about\n30% closer to the critical level and the UHF matching height would coincide with the upper-hybrid resonance height.\nand 930-MHz (UHF) incoherent scatter radars. As shown in\nFig. 15, in the case of the VHF radar, the pump electric field\nhas a large component in the geomagnetic field direction at\nboth the matching and critical heights. The excitation of both\ncascading and cavitating Langmuir turbulence should there-\nfore be relatively easily achieved. In the case of the UHF\nradar, the matching height lies several km below the criti-\ncal height at a point where the pump electric field is largely\nhorizontally polarized, and the excitation of cascading tur-\nbulence should be more difficult. These calculations suggest\nthat the maximum turbulence seen by the UHF radar ought\nto lie at the critical height between the Spitze angle and the\nvertical, yet the maximum occurs outside the Spitze, at an\nangle where the pump wave does not reach critical, and, per-\nhaps even more puzzling, at an altitude several km below the\nmaximum height reached by the pump. Mj\u00f8lhus et al. (2003)\nconsider this problem and are unable to suggest an explana-\ntion. At positions beyond the Spitze to the south, conditions\nfor strong polarization of the pump electric field along the\ngeomagnetic field are present when the pump wave is propa-\ngating downward after reflection. Whether this is important\nor not is an open question. Beyond the Spitze to the north\n(Mj\u00f8lhus, 1990), field-aligned polarization occurs while the\nray is still propagating upwards.\nBased on these considerations there appears to be no con-\nvincing reason why the geomagnetic field-aligned direction\nshould play such a prominent role, as is implied in the\nISR observations of electron temperature and of enhanced\nion and plasma lines, as shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4, and\nin airglow observations, such as those shown in Fig. 5.\nGurevich et al. (2002) have proposed an explanation for\nenhanced airglow at field-aligned based on HF self-focusing\non pump-induced plasma density striations, but they do not\ndiscuss possible mechanisms for the temperature and turbu-\nlence maxima observed between the Spitze and field-aligned\nangles.\nThe above considerations focus mainly on Langmuir tur-\nbulence. However, it is well known that upper-hybrid turbu-\nlence, occurring at the upper-hybrid level several km below\nthe critical height, is important for the production of plasma\ndensity striations and SEE. The SEE features, such as the\ndownshifted maximum and broad continuum, may be sig-\nnatures of cascading and cavitating upper-hybrid turbulence\nin the same way that the cascade and broad ISR spectra are\nthe signatures of cascading and cavitating Langmuir turbu-\nlence (Mj\u00f8lhus, 1998). Upper-hybrid turbulence is almost\ncertainly, perhaps in conjunction with Langmuir turbulence,\ninvolved in the production of the energetic electrons which\nproduce RF-induced airglow (Gustavsson et al., 2002; Kosch\net al., 2002a, 2004; Istomin and Leyser, 2003).\nPast angle-scanning observations have concentrated on the\nmagnetic meridian, mainly between vertical and magnetic\nfield-aligned. Very few observations have explored beyond\nfield-aligned to the south, even fewer have explored north\nof vertical. Optical imaging observations may cover a large\nfield-of-view in two dimensions, and observations of an\nairglow ring extending both along and across the meridian\nsuggest that not only elevation scans but also azimuth\nB. Isham et al.: Aspect angle dependence of stimulated electromagnetic emission 71\nscans might be of interest for ISR and other narrow-beam\nmeasurements.\nEven wide-angle observations must consider scanning, by\nthe pump beam, in order to illuminate regions of interest\nwithin the field-of-view. These include the interferometric\nSEE measurements discussed here along with wide-angle op-\ntical measurements. Circular scanning of the pump beam\nperformed at HAARP by Pedersen et al. (2003) show opti-\ncal emission enhancements only in the vicinity of the field-\naligned position. However, these observations were at rela-\ntively low ERP, similar to that used by Kosch et al. (2000).\nAt roughly five times greater ERP, Kosch et al. (2002b, 2004)\nfound not only that the airglow region formed a ring but that\nit followed the pump beam. The higher ERP is due mainly to\nthe use of the EISCAT high-gain HF antenna, which has a rel-\natively narrow 7.5-degree 3-dB full beamwidth. The higher\npower density and narrower beam imply higher RF electric\nfield and power gradients within the beam, another factor\nwhich could be important in the formation and movement\nof the airglow ring. The frequency was also very close to the\nfourth gyroharmonic, which could be important as this was\nalso different than past observations. Due to limitations in the\ntransmitter hardware, cross-meridian pump scanning cannot\nbe performed at EISCAT. However, when construction of the\nfinal HAARP array is complete, these experiments will be\nable to be repeated with scanning both along and across the\nmeridian at ERPs of over 1 GW. Another location of interest\nfor future observations is on Svalbard, where the SPEAR HF\nfacility, located next to the EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR),\nwas installed in 2003 and has been undergoing testing along\nwith preliminary experimentation since April 2004 (Wright\net al., 2000).\nDiffering conclusions have been reached regarding the\nrole of upper-hybrid vs. Langmuir turbulence in artificial\nairglow production under conditions of significantly differ-\nent ERP: upper-hybrid turbulence appeared to dominate with\nan ERP of about 110 MW (Kosch et al., 2002a), and Lang-\nmuir turbulence appeared to be important when using an\nERP of 550 MW (Kosch et al., 2004). However, these ob-\nservations were at the third and at or near the fourth gy-\nroharmonic, and used low and high gain antennas, produc-\ning lesser and greater RF field and power gradients, respec-\ntively, differences which again could be important. Although\nthermal electrons may play a role in producing RF-pump-\nenhanced airglow, non-thermal electrons, and therefore most\nlikely some form of turbulence, are still required to explain\nthe observations, even during experiments at relatively low\nERP (Gustavsson et al., 2002).\nEven if Langmuir turbulence turns out to be the correct ex-\nplanation for the airglow observations near the fourth gyro-\nharmonic at high ERP, a mystery remains at low ERP. At the\ngyroharmonics many pump-induced effects, including elec-\ntron temperature enhancements, anomalous absorption, arti-\nficial ionospheric irregularities, and upper-hybrid turbulence,\nare known to be minimized (Stubbe et al., 1994; Robin-\nson et al., 1996; Honary et al., 1999; Ponomarenko et al.,\n1999). Thus, the pump power which otherwise would be\nused to produce these effects should be available to produce\nLangmuir turbulence, and if Langmuir turbulence is a source\nof accelerated electrons, then airglow should be observed.\nHowever, artificial airglow is another effect that is known to\nbe minimized at the gyroharmonics during low ERP experi-\nments (Kosch et al., 2002a). This apparent paradox might be\nexplained if for some reason Langmuir turbulence turns out\nto have a relatively high threshold for electron acceleration.\nThe preliminary data presented in Figs. 12, 13, and 14\nhold great promise due in part to the nearness of the pump\nfrequency to the fourth gyroharmonic, which allows a com-\nparison between the BUM1 and DM features of the SEE\nspectrum. The BUM1 has been linked to Langmuir turbu-\nlence (Frolov and Nedzvedski, 2004; Frolov et al., 20041),\nand the pump-beam-following motion is consistent with\nthe high-pump-power fourth-gyroharmonic (approximately\n5.423 MHz) optical observations, also linked to Langmuir\nturbulence. By contrast the DM is linked to upper hybrid\nturbulence (Mj\u00f8lhus, 1998; Leyser, 2001). The angles cal-\nculated from the present data show that both the BUM1 and\nthe DM may be equally affected by the HF beam direction\nchange, although the DM appears to reside at higher ele-\nvation angle than the BUM1. These results are tentative.\nHowever, a difference in the aspect angle behavior of these\nfeatures could have important implications for the underly-\ning physics of the turbulence and for the explanation of past\nobservations. The possible angle dependence of the BUM2,\nas suggested by the 12 November 2001 beam swinging data\nshown in Fig. 10, is also of interest in this regard and can be\nfurther investigated using the new data set. Final conclusions\nmust await additional and complete processing and interpre-\ntation of the SEE and other available data.\nThe apparently repeatable, gradual decrease in the coher-\nence of both the BUM1 and DM features could be due to an\nincrease in the size of the source region during the pump-on\nperiod. This might be understood, for example, if the initial\nsize were of the order of one or several Fresnel zones at the\npump wavelength, increasing thereafter to encompass addi-\ntional Fresnel zones, thus increasing destructive interference\nbetween neighboring locations within the source region and\nreducing the coherence. At 5.423 MHz, a Fresnel zone is of\nthe order of (\u03bbhfrsee)1\/2=[(55.32 m)(180 km)]1\/2=3.2 km,\nwhere \u03bbhf is the free-space wavelength and rsee is the range\nto the SEE source region as determined from EISCAT 224-\nMHz radar measurements. An interesting and unexplained\nobservation is the apparent dependence of the DM coherence\non the orientation of the antenna baseline. The significance\nof this, and of the structure observed in the DM coherence\nplots, is currently unknown.\nStubbe and Hagfors (1997) comment: \u201cOne of the short-\ncomings in the theoretical work appears to be an inappropri-\nate treatment of the low frequency turbulence which depends\nvery sensitively on the direction with respect to the magnetic\nfield, implying that the full angular spectrum rather than a\nprescribed fixed angular component should be considered.\u201d\nAlthough Mj\u00f8lhus et al. (2003) have recently addressed this\n72 B. Isham et al.: Aspect angle dependence of stimulated electromagnetic emission\ncriticism for the theoretical interpretation of incoherent scat-\nter observations of Langmuir turbulence, much remains to\nbe done. Furthermore, this comment applies equally well to\nexperimental results. Pump-enhanced electron temperature,\nirregularities, airglow, and upper-hybrid and Langmuir turbu-\nlence are now experimentally known to be aspect-angle de-\npendent. This further supports the contention that SEE must\nalso be, and provides additional impetus for performing the\nangle-resolved SEE measurements discussed here.\n5 Conclusions\nThe intensification of HF-enhanced Langmuir waves and\nairglow near the geomagnetic field-aligned direction sug-\ngest that stimulated electromagnetic emission might exhibit\na similar angular dependence, possibly different for the dif-\nferent spectral features. In order to see if this suspicion holds\ntrue, a pilot experiment has been completed and data analysis\nis underway.\nBy combining two antenna pairs as interferometers with\napproximately north-south and east-west baselines, with an-\ntenna spacing on the order of a wavelength in the frequency\nband of interest, the cross-phase from each pair is being used\nto calculate the direction of the signal-weighted average of\nthe SEE source region within the HF pump beam pattern.\nThese results are valid in regions of high cross-spectral co-\nherence. Preliminary calculations already suggest intrigu-\ning connections with past angle scanning results using other\ntechniques.\nIn future observations, the use of two orthogonally-\npolarized antennas along each baseline would allow the study\nof possible polarization dependence of the results. Multiple\nantennas at multi-wavelength spacings might at some time\nbe used to produce images of the SEE source region, thereby\nremoving the signal-weighted limitation of the current tech-\nnique.\nIt is our hope that, in this way, a wealth of new informa-\ntion will be obtained on the wave interaction and turbulent\nprocesses occurring in the pump-plasma interaction region.\nSuch results promise to be a new and important resource in\nhelping to identify SEE excitation mechanisms and their re-\nlation to the observational and theoretical properties of Lang-\nmuir and upper-hybrid turbulence.\nAcknowledgements.
