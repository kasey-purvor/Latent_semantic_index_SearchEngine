INTRODUCTION \nSince transition bandwidths of the filters in two-channel filter banks are usually larger than those in \nmulti-channel filter banks, lengths of the filters in two-channel filter banks are usually shorter than those in \nmulti-channel filter banks. Moreover, as only a single prototype filter is required for the design of a QMF \nbank and all other filters are derived from the prototype filter, the total number of filter coefficients required \nfor the design of a QMF bank is usually smaller than those in general filter banks. Furthermore, as the linear \nphase property of the filters guarantees no phase distortion of the filter bank and the FIR property of the \nfilters guarantees the bounded input bounded output stability of the filter bank, two-channel linear phase FIR \nQMF banks find many applications in image and video signal processing [1]. \nUnlike a multi-channel QMF bank [2], [3], a two-channel QMF bank could not achieve the exact \nperfect reconstruction with the prototype filter having very good frequency selectivity [4]. Hence, it is useful \nto design a two-channel QMF bank so that a weighted sum of the maximum amplitude distortion of the filter \nbank, the maximum passband ripple magnitude and the maximum stopband ripple magnitude of the  \n \nCopyright (c) 2010 IEEE.

Nevertheless, this QMF bank \nminimax design problem is a nonconvex optimization problem. As nonconvex optimization problems usually \nconsist of many local minima [14], it is usually stuck at these local minima and very difficult to find the \nglobal minimum if conventional gradient based approaches are employed for finding the global minimum. \nWhen nonconvex optimization problems consist of finite numbers of local minima, it is possible to \nfind the global minimum of these nonconvex optimization problems. There are mainly two different \napproaches for finding the global minimum of these nonconvex optimization problems. The first type of the \napproaches is nongradient based approaches, such as evolutionary algorithm based approaches [5], [6]. These \napproaches keep generating evaluation points randomly. Those evaluation points with better performances \nare kept, while those evaluation points with poor performances are ignored. However, computational \ncomplexities of these nongradient based approaches are very high because most of the evaluation points are \nignored. The second type of the approaches is filled function approaches [7]-[12]. The definition of filled \nfunctions and the working principle of filled function methods are discussed in Section II. Nevertheless, it is \nvery challenging to find a filled function that satisfies the required properties. To tackle this difficulty, filled \nfunctions with several parameters are defined [7]-[12]. However, there is no general rule for the selection of \nthese parameters. In this correspondence, extra constraints are imposed on the optimization problems so that \nthe required properties of the filled function are guaranteed to be satisfied. \nIn this correspondence, a modified filled function method is proposed for finding the global minimum \nof a two-channel linear phase FIR QMF bank minimax design problem. The outline of this correspondence is \nas follows. In Section II, the definition of filled functions and the working principle of filled function \nmethods are reviewed. In Section III, a two-channel linear phase FIR QMF bank minimax design problem is \nformulated as a nonconvex optimization problem and a modified filled function method is proposed for \nfinding the global minimum of the nonconvex optimization problem. In Section IV, computer numerical \nsimulations are illustrated. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V. \n \nII. REVIEW ON DEFINITION OF FILLED FUNCTIONS AND WORKING PRINCIPLE OF \nFILLED FUNCTION METHODS \nA filled function [7]-[12] is a function satisfying the following properties: (a) the current local \nminimum of the original cost function is the current local maximum of the filled function; (b) the whole \ncurrent basin of the original cost function is a part of the current hill of the filled function; (c) the filled \nfunction has no stationary point in any higher basins of the original cost function; and (d) there exists a local \nminimum of the filled function which is in a lower basin of the original cost function. \nSome terminologies related to filled functions have been used above. Notably, a basin of a function is \ndefined as the subset of the domain of the optimization variables such that any points in this subset will give \nthe same local minimum of the function via conventional gradient based optimization methods. A hill of a \nfunction is defined as the subset of the domain of the optimization variables such that any points in this \nsubset will give the same local maximum of the function via conventional gradient based optimization \nmethods. A higher basin of a function is a basin of the function with the cost value of the local minimum of \nthe basin being higher than that of the current basin of the function. A lower basin of a function is a basin of \nthe function with the cost value of the local minimum of the basin being lower than that of the current basin \nof the function. \nDue to property (a), by evaluating the filled function at a point slightly deviated from the current local \nminimum of the original cost function, a lower filled function value can be obtained. Hence, the filled \nfunction could kick away from the current local minimum of the original cost function. Due to properties \n(b)-(d), the current local minimum of the filled function is neither in the current basin nor any higher basins \nof the original cost function. Hence, the current local minimum of the filled function is in a lower basin of \nthe original cost function. As a result, by finding the next local minimum of the original cost function, i.e., \nsearching the neighborhood around the current local minimum of the filled function, a better local minimum \nof the original cost function can be obtained. Following these procedures, if the original cost function \ncontains a finite number of local minima [14], then the global minimum of the original cost function will be \neventually reached. \n \nIII. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND MODIFIED FILLED FUNCTION METHOD \nA. Problem formulation \nDenote the transpose operator, the conjugate operator and the conjugate transpose operator as the \nsuperscripts T , \u2217  and + , respectively, and the modulus operator as \u22c5 .

In general, it is difficult to find the global \nminimum of a nonconvex optimization problem. \nB. Modified filled function method \nTo find the global minimum of a nonconvex optimization problem, the following algorithm is \nproposed. \nAlgorithm \nStep 1: Initialize a minimum improvement factor \u03b5 , an accepted error \u03b5\u2032 , an initial search point 1~x , a \npositive definite matrix R  and an iteration index 1=k . \nStep 2: Find a local minimum of the following optimization Problem ( fP ) using our previous proposed \nintegration approach with the initial search point kx~  [13]. \nProblem ( fP ) \nx\nmin  (28a), \nsubject to (28b)-(28f), \n ( ) ( )( ) 0~16 \u2264\u2212\u2212\u2261 kTag xx\u03b9x \u03b5 , (29a) \n ( ) ( )( ) 0~17 \u2264\u2212\u2212\u2261 kTpg xx\u03b9x \u03b5  (29b) \nand ( ) ( )( ) 0~18 \u2264\u2212\u2212\u2261 kTsg xx\u03b9x \u03b5 , (29c) \nwhere ( )x6g , ( )x7g  and ( )x8g  are the constraint functions we imposed. Denote the obtained local \nminimum as \u2217kx . \nStep 3: Find a local minimum of the following optimization Problem ( HP ) using our previous proposed \nintegration approach with the initial search point \u2217kx  [13]. \nProblem ( HP ) \nx\nmin  ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\u2217\u2217 \u2212\u2212+++\u2261 kTk\nT\nspaH\nxxRxx\nx\u03b9\u03b9\u03b9x 1\u03b3\u03b2\u03b1 , (30a) \nsubject to (28b)-(28f), \n ( ) ( )( ) 016 \u2264\u2212\u2212\u2261\u2032 \u2217kTag xx\u03b9x \u03b5 , (30b) \n ( ) ( )( ) 017 \u2264\u2212\u2212\u2261\u2032 \u2217kTpg xx\u03b9x \u03b5  (30c) \nand ( ) ( )( ) 018 \u2264\u2212\u2212\u2261\u2032 \u2217kTsg xx\u03b9x \u03b5 , (30d) \nwhere ( )xH  is the filled function we defined, and ( )x6g \u2032 , ( )x7g \u2032  and ( )x8g \u2032  are the constraint functions we \nimposed. Denote the obtained local minimum as 1~ +kx . Increment the value of k . \nStep 4: Iterate Step 2 and Step 3 until ( ) ( ) \u03b5\u03b3\u03b2\u03b1 \u2032\u2264\u2212++ \u2217\u2212\u2217 1kkTspa xx\u03b9\u03b9\u03b9 . (31) \nTake the final vector of \u2217kx  as the global minimum of the original optimization problem. \nStep 1 is an initialization of the proposed algorithm. In order not to terminate the algorithm when the \nconvergence of the algorithm is slow and to have a high accuracy of the solution, both \u03b5  and \u03b5\u2032  should be \nchosen as small values. Also, as 1~x  is an initial search point of the optimization algorithm, this initial search \npoint should be in the feasible set. However, in general it is difficult to guarantee that 1~x  is in the feasible \nset, it should be chosen in such a way that most of the constraints are satisfied. Moreover, as R  is a positive \ndefinite matrix, it controls the spread of the hill of ( )xH  at \u2217kx . If R  is a diagonal matrix with all diagonal \nelements being the same and positive, then large values of these diagonal elements will result to a wide \nspread of the hill of ( )xH  at \u2217kx  and vice versa. Since the local minima of nonconvex optimization \nproblems could be located very close together [14], the spread of the hill of ( )xH  at \u2217kx  should be small \nIEEE Transactions on Signal Processing \n 6\nand the diagonal elements of R  should be chosen as small positive numbers. Step 2 is to find a local \nminimum of ( )xf . As the constraints (29a)-(29c) are imposed on the Problem ( fP ), the maximum amplitude \ndistortion of the filter bank, the maximum ripple magnitude and the maximum stopband ripple magnitude of \nthe prototype filter corresponding to the new obtained local minimum are guaranteed to be lower than that \ncorresponding to kx~ . Similarly, Step 3 is to find a local minimum of ( )xH . As the constraints (30b)-(30d) \nare imposed on the Problem ( HP ), the maximum amplitude distortion of the filter bank, the maximum ripple \nmagnitude and the maximum stopband ripple magnitude of the prototype filter are guaranteed to be lower \nthan that corresponding to \u2217kx . Step 4 is a termination test procedure. If the difference of the weighted \nperformance between two consecutive iterations is smaller than a certain bound \u03b5\u2032 , then the algorithm is \nterminated. \nIt has been discussed in Section I that conventional filled function methods require that (a) the current \nlocal minimum of the original cost function is the current local maximum of the filled function; (b) the whole \ncurrent basin of the original cost function is a part of the current hill of the filled function; (c) the filled \nfunction has no stationary point in any higher basins of the original cost function; and (d) there exists a local \nminimum of the filled function which is in a lower basin of the original cost function. As R  is a positive \ndefinite matrix and \u2217kx  is in the denominator of ( )xH , ( ) +\u221e\u2192xH  as \u2217\u2192 kxx . Hence, \u2217kx  is the global \nmaximum of ( )xH  and property (a) is guaranteed to be satisfied. As the constraints (30b)-(30d) are imposed \non the Problem ( HP ), when a new local minimum of ( )xH  is found, this new local minimum of ( )xH  will \nnot be located at \u2217kx  and the original cost value evaluated at 1~ +kx  will guarantee to be lower than that at \u2217kx . \nHence, properties (b)-(d) are guaranteed to be satisfied. As a result, the proposed algorithm guarantees to \nreach the global minimum of the nonconvex optimization problem. \nAs the efficiency of general nonconvex optimization algorithms would depend on the initial search \npoints, the total number of local minima of the optimization problems and the stopping criteria of the \noptimization algorithms, there is always a tradeoff between the accuracy of the obtained solutions and the \nefficiency of the optimization algorithms. For nongradient based approaches, as most of the evaluation points \nare ignored, the effectiveness of these algorithms is low. On the other hand, our proposed method guarantees \nto obtain the local minimum in each iteration, the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is high. Hence, for \nthe same period of time, our proposed method would obtain a better solution than that of nongradient based \napproaches. \n \nIV. NUMERICAL COMPUTER SIMULATIONS \nIn order to have a fair comparison, the performance of the QMF banks designed via our proposed \nmethod is compared to that designed via the minimax approach discussed in [4]. We choose the same \npassband, stopband, filter length, maximum passband ripple magnitude, maximum stopband ripple \nmagnitude and desirable magnitude response of the prototype filter as that in [4], that is [ ]\u03c0\u03c0 4.0,4.0\u2212=pB , (32) \n[ ] [ ]\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 6.0,,6.0 \u2212\u2212= UsB , (33) \n36=N , (34) \n50\u2212=p\u03b5 dB, (35) \n50\u2212=s\u03b5 dB (36) \nand \n( )\n\u23a9\u23a8\n\u23a7\n\u2208\n\u2208=\ns\np\nB\nB\nD \u03c9\n\u03c9\u03c9\n0\n1 . (37) \nIn order to guarantee that the performance of the QMF bank designed via our proposed method is better than \nthat in [4], the specification on the maximum amplitude distortion of the filter bank is chosen as 58\u2212=a\u03b5 dB, \nwhich is better than that in [4] ( 4576.50003.0 \u2212==a\u03b5 dB). In order not to have any bias among the maximum \namplitude distortion of the filter bank, the maximum passband ripple magnitude and the maximum stopband \nripple magnitude of the prototype filter, all the weights in the cost function are chosen to be the same, that is \n1=== \u03b3\u03b2\u03b1 . In this correspondence, 610\u2212=\u2032= \u03b5\u03b5  are chosen which is small enough for most applications. \n1\n~x  is chosen as the filter coefficients obtained via the Remez exchange algorithm, which guarantee to satisfy \nthe specifications on the maximum passband ripple magnitude and the maximum stopband ripple magnitude \nof the prototype filter. R  is chosen as the diagonal matrix with all diagonal elements equal to 310\u2212 , which is \nIEEE Transactions on Signal Processing \n 7\nsmall enough for most applications. \nTo compare the efficiency of the designed method, our proposed method only takes three iterations to \nconverge and the total time required for the computer numerical simulations is 1.6 seconds. On the other \nhand, the method discussed in [4] takes 68 iterations to converge and the total time required for the computer \nnumerical simulations is 80 seconds. Hence, it can be concluded that the method discussed in [4] requires \nmore computational efforts than our proposed method and our proposed method is more efficient than that \ndiscussed in [4]. The magnitude responses of the filter banks as well as the magnitude responses of the \nprototype filters in both the passband and the stopband designed via our proposed method are shown in \nFigure 1. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the prototype filter designed by our proposed method could \nachieve 2416.64\u2212=p\u03b4 dB and 3625.50\u2212=s\u03b4 dB, and the QMF bank could achieve 1557.58\u2212=a\u03b4 dB. It can be \nchecked easily that the QMF bank designed via our proposed method achieves better performances on the \nmaximum amplitude distortion of the filter bank, the maximum passband ripple magnitude and the maximum \nstopband ripple magnitude ripple of the prototype filter than that designed by the method discussed in [4]. \nThis is because the QMF bank designed by the method discussed in [4] is not the global minimum, while that \ndesigned by our proposed method is the global minimum. \n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n-100\n-90\n-80\n-70\n-60\n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\nFrequency \u03c9\nM\nag\nni\ntu\nde\n re\nsp\non\nse\n o\nf o\nur\n d\nes\nig\nne\nd \nfil\nte\nr b\nan\nk \n(d\nB)\n \nIEEE Transactions on Signal Processing \n 8\n0 0.5 1 1.5\n-100\n-95\n-90\n-85\n-80\n-75\n-70\n-65\n-60\n-55\n-50\n-45\nFrequency \u03c9\nM\nag\nni\ntu\nde\n re\nsp\non\nse\n o\nf o\nur\n d\nes\nig\nne\nd \npr\not\not\nyp\ne \nfil\nte\nr i\nn \nth\ne \npa\nss\nba\nnd\n (d\nB)\n \n1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3\n-100\n-95\n-90\n-85\n-80\n-75\n-70\n-65\n-60\n-55\n-50\n-45\nFrequency \u03c9\nM\nag\nni\ntu\nde\n re\nsp\non\nse\n o\nf o\nur\n d\nes\nig\nne\nd \npr\not\not\nyp\ne \nfil\nte\nr i\nn \nth\ne \nst\nop\nba\nnd\n (d\nB)\n \nFigure 1.
