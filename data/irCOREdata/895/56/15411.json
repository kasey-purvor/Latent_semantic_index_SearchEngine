Let G = (VG; EG) be an\narbitrary triangle-free graph with minimum degree at least two and \u00be4(G) \u00b8\njVGj+2. We \u00afrst show that either for any path P in G there exists a cycle C\nsuch that jVP n VC j \u00b7 1, or G is isomorphic to exactly one exception. Using\nthis result, we show that for any set S of at most \u00b1 vertices in G there exists\na cycle C such that S \u00b5 VC .\n1 Introduction\nLet G = (VG; EG) be a graph, where VG is a \u00afnite set of order jVGj = n and EG is a\nset of unordered pairs of two di\u00aeerent vertices, called edges. For graph terminology\nnot de\u00afned below we refer to [10]. For simplicity, we sometimes denote jVGj by jGj\nand \\u 2 VG\" by \\u 2 G\". For a vertex u 2 G we denote its neighborhood, i.e., the\nset of adjacent vertices, by NG(u) = fv juv 2 EGg. The degree dG(u) of a vertex u\nis the number of edges incident with it, or equivalently the size of its neighborhood.\nThe minimum degree of G is denoted by \u00b1G. If no confusion is possible we will omit\nthe subscript G in the later notations.\n1This work was done when the author was visiting Nihon University, supported by KAKENHI\n(13304005)\n2Supported by KAKENHI (14740087)\n1\nA graph H is a subgraph of a graph G, denoted by H \u00b5 G, if VH \u00b5 VG and\nEH \u00b5 EG. For a subset U \u00b5 VG we denote by G[U ] the induced subgraph of G over\nU ; hence G[U ] = (U;EG \\ (U \u00a3U)). For simplicity, we denote G[VGnVH ] by G\u00a1H.\nWe denote the complement of a graph G = (V;E) by G = (V; (V \u00a3 V )nE). For\ntwo graphs G1 = (V1; E1) and G2 = (V2; E2), we denote their union by G1 [ G2 =\n(V1[V2; E1[E2) and their join by G1\u00a4G2 = (V1[V2; E1[E2[(V1\u00a3V2)). A complete\ngraph is a graph with an edge between every pair of vertices. The complete graph\non n vertices is denoted by Kn. The complete bipartite graph Kk \u00a4K` is denoted by\nKk;`.\nA graph G is called connected if for every pair of distinct vertices u and v, there\nexists a path P connecting u and v, i.e., a sequence P = v1v2 : : : vp of distinct vertices\nstarting by u = v1 and ending by v = vp, where each pair of consecutive vertices\nforms an edge of G. The vertices v1 and vp are called the ends of P . The order of a\nlongest path in G is denoted by pG. A vertex u is called a cut vertex of a connected\ngraph G if G[V nfug] is disconnected. A graph G = (V;E) is called k-connected if\nG[V nU ] is connected for any set U \u00b5 V of at most k \u00a1 1 vertices. A cycle C is\na sequence v1v2 : : : vpv1 of distinct vertices, where each pair of consecutive vertices\nforms an edge. The order of a longest cycle in a graph G is called the circumference\ncG. A cycle C is called dominating if G\u00a1 C is edgeless.\nLet G = (V;E) be a graph. A set U \u00b5 V is called independent if G does\nnot contain edges with both ends in U . The number of vertices in a maximum\nindependent set is called the independence number of G. We denote\n\u00bek(G) = minf\nkX\ni=1\ndG(xi) j x1; x2; : : : ; xk are distinct and independentg:\nIf the independence number of G is less than k, then we de\u00afne \u00bek(G) =1.\nPrevious research\nA graph G is called hamiltonian if G contains a cycle C with VC = VG. The\nproblem of \u00afnding whether a given graph G is hamiltonian is one of the oldest\nproblems in the history of graph theory and has direct applications to, for example,\nthe travelling salesman problem. See Gould [14] for a survey. For a graph G that\nis not hamiltonian, a natural question is to ask how close it is to hamiltonicity. To\n2\nmeasure this, we can take the di\u00aeerence pG\u00a1 cG, called the relative length, between\nthe order of a longest path and the circumference of G. We observe that pG\u00a1cG = 0\nif and only if G is hamiltonian. Furthermore, pG \u00a1 cG \u00b7 1 implies that all longest\ncycles are dominating. In order to see this, suppose C is a non-dominating longest\ncycle of a graph G. So jCj = cG. Since C is non-dominating, G \u00a1 C contains an\nedge. We take a shortest path connecting this edge to C and extend it with cG \u00a1 1\nedges of C, say P . We then \u00afnd that pG \u00a1 cG \u00b8 jP j \u00a1 jCj \u00b8 2, a contradiction. In\nthe literature many results on dominating cycles and the relative length pG\u00a1 cG can\nbe found (see, e.g., [17, 18, 22, 23]).\nOre [19] showed that a graph G with \u00be2 \u00b8 n is hamiltonian. Bondy [5] studied\n\u00be3 and proved the following result.\nTheorem 1 ([5]). If G is a 2-connected graph with \u00be3 \u00b8 n + 2, then all longest\ncycles are dominating.\nThe lower bound on \u00be3 in Theorem 1 is tight. One can see this as follows.\nConsider the graph Gk = (Kk [Kk [Kk) \u00a4K2 of order n = 3k + 2 for k \u00b8 2. It is\neasy to check that Gk is 2-connected and has \u00be3(Gk) = 3k + 3 = n + 1. However,\nsince each cycle in Gk can pass through K2 at most twice, any longest cycle does\nnot contain vertices of one Kk, and consequently is not dominating.\nEnomoto et al. [12] proved the following.\nTheorem 2 ([12]). If G is a 2-connected graph with \u00be3 \u00b8 n+ 2, then pG \u00a1 cG \u00b7 1.\nWe already noted that pG\u00a1cG \u00b7 1 implies that all longest cycles are dominating.\nHence, Theorem 2 generalizes Theorem 1. Clearly, the opposite is not true. For\nexample, consider the graph obtained from a cycle u1u2 : : : upu1 by adding two new\nvertices v and w and two edges vu1 and wu2.\nOur results\nIn this paper we are interested in proving a similar result for triangle-free graphs\n(graphs that do not contain K3) corresponding to Theorem 2 of Enomoto et al. Is it\npossible to make a jump from \u00be3 to \u00be4 when we restrict ourselves to this graph class?\nTriangle-free graphs are the natural generalization of bipartite graphs and therefore\nhave been widely studied in the literature, also in the context of hamiltonian research\n3\n(cf. [2, 3, 7, 13, 16]). Broersma, Yoshimoto and Zhang [9] showed that a 2-connected\ntriangle-free graph with \u00be3 \u00b8 (n+ 5)=2 contains a longest cycle that is dominating.\nThe lower bound on \u00be3 is tight, even for the existence of dominating cycles. Note\nthat graphs satisfying the conditions of this theorem might contain longest cycles\nthat are not dominating. However, if \u00be2 \u00b8 (n + 1)=2, then all longest cycles are\ndominating [24]. This lower bound is almost best possible by examples due to Ash\nand Jackson [1].\nThe main result of this paper is as follows. Its proof is given in Section 2.\nTheorem 3. Let G be a triangle-free graph with \u00b1 \u00b8 2 not isomorphic to the graph\nin Figure 1(i). If \u00be4 \u00b8 n + 2 then for any path P there exists a cycle C such that\njP \u00a1 Cj \u00b7 1.\n* * * *\n(i) (ii)\nFigure 1: (i) exception for Theorem 3, (ii) the graph H5.\nWe note that Theorem 3 immediately implies that pG\u00a1cG \u00b7 1. Hence, this result\nfor triangle-free graphs is \\similar\" to Theorem 2 of Enomoto et al. for 2-connected\ngraphs.\nThe lower bound on \u00be4 in Theorem 3 is tight. In order to see this, consider the\ngraph Hk = Kk\u00a11 \u00a4 Kk \u00a4 K1 \u00a4 Kk \u00a4 Kk\u00a11 of order n = 4k \u00a1 1 for k \u00b8 2. For an\nillustration of the case k = 5, see Figure 1(ii). Obviously, Hk is triangle-free. It is\neasy to check that Hk has minimum degree 2 \u00b7 \u00b1Hk = k = n+14 . Since Hk contains\nat least four vertices of minimum degree, we \u00afnd that \u00be4(Hk) = n+1. Furthermore,\nHk contains a path P of order jP j = n. However, any cycle can pass through K1\nat most once. So a longest cycle C contains all vertices of exactly one Kk\u00a11, one\nadjacent Kk and the vertex of the K1. Hence, for all k \u00b8 2, the circumference of Hk\nis cHk = 2k =\nn+1\n2\n\u00b7 n\u00a12. So, for P there does not exist a cycle C with jP\u00a1Cj \u00b7 1.\nThis means that the bound on \u00be4 is tight indeed.\n4\nIn Theorem 3 no condition is imposed on the connectivity of a graph. A natural\nquestion (cf. Theorem 2) is to ask whether adding such a condition would be helpful\nfor decreasing the lower bound on \u00be4. However, this is not the case: we can add\nall possible edges between the left Kk\u00a11 and the right Kk\u00a11 in Hk. This way we\nobtain a new graph H 0k that is still triangle-free, has minimum degree\nn+1\n4\n\u00b8 2\nand \u00be4(H\n0\nk) = n + 1, and furthermore contains a path of length n. However, a\nlongest cycle C will pass through all vertices except one vertex of each Kk\u00a11, so\njCj = cH0k = n\u00a1 2. We reach the same conclusion as before.\nIn the literature the following related problem has been studied for general graphs\nand graph classes (see, e.g., [4, 6, 8, 11, 15, 20, 21]): for a given graph G, does any\nsubset S of vertices of restricted size have some cycle passing through it? As an\napplication of Theorem 3, we obtain the following result for triangle-free graphs. Its\nfull proof is given in Section 3.\nTheorem 4. Let G be a triangle-free graph with \u00b1 \u00b8 2. If \u00be4 \u00b8 n+ 2, then for any\nset S of at most \u00b1 vertices, there exists a cycle C such that S \u00b5 VC.\nThis result implies that a triangle-free graph with \u00b1 \u00b8 2 and \u00be4 \u00b8 n + 2 is\n2-connected. On the other hand, the previously de\u00afned graph Hk contains a cut\nvertex, namely the vertex of the K1. Hence, the lower bound on \u00be4 in Theorem 4 is\ntight. In Section 3 we show that a triangle-free graph with \u00b1 \u00b8 2 and \u00be4 \u00b8 n+ 1 is\nconnected. The lower bound on \u00be4 is tight due to the graph Kk;k [Kk;k for k \u00b8 2.\nAdditional notations\nLet G = (V;E) be a graph. For a subset U \u00b5 V and vertex u 2 V we sometimes\nwrite \\Unu\" instead of \\Unfug\".\nLet H be a subgraph of G. We denote NG(x)\\ VH by NH(x) and its cardinality\njNH(x)j by dH(x). The set of neighbours\nS\nv2H NG(v) n VH is denoted by NG(H)\nor N(H). For an edge e = uv in G, we write N(e) = N(fu; vg). For a subgraph\nF \u00b5 G, we write NG(H) \\ VF as NF (H).\nLet C = v1v2 : : : vpv1 be a cycle with a \u00afxed orientation. The successor vi+1 of\nvi is denoted by v\n+\ni and its predecessor vi\u00a11 by v\n\u00a1\ni . For a vertex subset A in C, we\ndenote fv+i j vi 2 Ag and fv\u00a1i j vi 2 Ag by A+ and A\u00a1, respectively. The segment\nvivi+1 : : : vj is written as vi\n\u00a1!\nC vj, where the subscripts are to be taken modulo jCj.\n5\nThe converse segment vjvj\u00a11 : : : vi is written as vj\n\u00c3\u00a1\nC vi. Similarly, for a path P =\nu1u2 : : : up, we use the notations ui\n\u00a1!\nP uj = uiui+1 : : : uj and uj\n\u00c3\u00a1\nP ui = ujuj\u00a11 : : : ui.\n2 The Proof of Theorem 3\nLet S be a vertex subset of G. If a path P is a longest path over all paths containing\nS, then we call P amaximal path for S. The set of all maximal paths for S is denoted\nby P(S). Before proving Theorem 3 we \u00afrst show the following lemma.\nLemma 5. Let G be a triangle-free graph with \u00b1G \u00b8 2 not isomorphic to the graph\nin Figure 1i. Then for any path R, there either exists a path in P(VR) such that the\ndegree sum of the ends is at least \u00be4(G)=2, or else a cycle C such that jR\u00a1Cj \u00b7 1.\nProof. Let G be a triangle-free graph with \u00b1G \u00b8 2. Assume that G is not isomorphic\nto the graph in Figure 1i. Let R be any path in G and P = u1u2 : : : up 2 P(VR) such\nthat the degree sum of the ends is maximal in P(VR). Notice that N(u1) = NP (u1)\nand N(up) = NP (up). So all neighbors of u1 and up in G belong to P .\nSuppose there are vertices ui 2 N(u1)nu2 and uj 2 N(up)nup\u00a11 such that i \u00b7 j.\nThen fu1; ui\u00a11; uj+1; upg is independent; otherwise there is a triangle (forbidden) or\na cycle containing VR (we are done). Because d(u1)+d(ui\u00a11)+d(uj+1)+d(up) \u00b8 \u00be4,\none of the degree sums d(u1) + d(up) and d(ui\u00a11) + d(uj+1) is at least \u00be4=2. Hence,\nat least one of the paths P or ui\u00a11\n\u00c3\u00a1\nP u1ui\n\u00a1!\nP ujup\n\u00c3\u00a1\nP uj+1 is a desired path.\nIn the remaining case we have\ni > j for any two vertices ui 2 N(u1) n u2 and uj 2 N(up) n up\u00a11. (1)\nSuppose there is a vertex us 2 NP (u1) n fu2; up\u00a12g. Since \u00b1G \u00b8 2 and N(up) =\nNP (up), vertex up has a neighbor ut 6= up\u00a11 on P . Then we \u00afnd that the path\nP 0 = ut+1\n\u00a1!\nP usu1\n\u00a1!\nP utup\n\u00c3\u00a1\nP us+1 is a path in P(VR). The vertex u1 is not adjacent\nto ut+1 nor us+1; otherwise there is a triangle or a cycle containing VR. Also, the\nvertex up is not adjacent to ut+1 nor to us+1 by statement (1) and us 6= up\u00a12. Thus\nfu1; ut+1; us+1; upg is an independent set. Hence, at least one of the paths P and\nP 0 is a desired path as in the previous case. Therefore N(u1) = fu2; up\u00a12g and, by\nsymmetry, N(up) = fu3; up\u00a11g. Furthermore, by the maximality of the degree sum\nof the ends of P we deduce that\nthe degree of an end of any path in P(VR) is two:\n6\nBecause the path u1u2u3up\n\u00c3\u00a1\nP u4 is in P(VR), the vertex u1 has to be adjacent to\nu++4 = u6; otherwise, as in the above case, we can obtain a desired cycle or path.\nTherefore u6 = up\u00a12, i.e., p = 8, and so any vertex in fu1; u2; u4; u5; u7; u8g is the\nend of some path in P(VR), and consequently has degree two. As G is triangle-free,\nthe vertices u1; u5 and u7 are mutually disjoint. If G\u00a1P is not empty, then for any\nx 2 G\u00a1 P , the set fx; u1; u5; u7g is independent. Hence we \u00afnd that\nd(x) \u00b8 \u00be4 \u00a1 (d(u1) + d(u5) + d(u7)) \u00b8 n+ 2\u00a1 6 = n\u00a1 4:\nHowever, x is adjacent to none of the vertices in fu1; u2; u4; u5; u7; u8g because their\ndegrees are all equal to two. Thus d(x) \u00b7 n\u00a17, a contradiction. Therefore G\u00a1P = ;\nand n = 8. As u3 is adjacent to none of the vertices u1; u5; u7, vertex u3 has to be\nadjacent to u6; otherwise d(u1) + d(u3) + d(u5) + d(u7) = 9 < n + 2. Hence G is\nisomorphic to the graph in Figure 1i, a contradiction.\nWe are ready to prove Theorem 3. Let G be a triangle-free graph with \u00b1 \u00b8 2 and\n\u00be4 \u00b8 n + 2 that is not isomorphic to the graph in Figure 1i. Let R be any path in\nG. We prove that G contains a desired cycle, i.e., a cycle C such that jR\u00a1 Cj \u00b7 1.\nSuppose the independence number of G is at most three. Then \u00be4(G) =1. By\nLemma 5, there exists a cycle C such that jR\u00a1 Cj \u00b7 1.\nFrom now on we assume that the independence number of G is at least four. Let\nP = u1u2 : : : up 2 P(VR) such that\nthe degree sum of the ends is maximal in P(VR). (2)\nThen from Lemma 5, d(u1)+d(up) \u00b8 \u00be4=2. Notice that we may assume that there is\nno path in P(VR) whose ends are adjacent; otherwise obviously there exists a cycle\ncontaining VR.\nIf there is ul 2 NP (u1) \\ NP (up)+, then the cycle u1\u00a1!P u\u00a1l up\n\u00c3\u00a1\nP ulu1 is a desired\ncycle. Thus we can suppose NP (u1) \\ NP (up)+ = ;. Similarly, we get NP (u1) \\\nNP (up)\n++ = ; and NP (u1)\u00a1 \\NP (up)+ = ;. If NP (u1)\u00a1 \\NP (up)++ is also empty,\nthen NP (u1); NP (u1)\n\u00a1; NP (up)+ and (NP (up) n up)++ are mutually disjoint. Hence\nwe \u00afnd that\nn \u00b8 jP j \u00b8 jNP (u1)j+ jNP (u1)\u00a1j+ jNP (up)+j+ j(NP (up) n up)++j\n\u00b8 2d(u1) + 2d(up)\u00a1 1 \u00b8 \u00be4 \u00a1 1 > n:\n7\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore NP (u1)\n\u00a1 \\NP (up)++ 6= ;.\nLet ui 2 NP (u1)\u00a1 \\NP (up)++.\nClaim 1. If d(ui) + d(ui\u00a11) > n=2, then there is a desired cycle.\nProof. Let e0 = x1x2 = ui\u00a11ui and\nC = u1\n\u00a1!\nP ui\u00a12up\n\u00c3\u00a1\nP ui+1u1 = v1v2 : : : vp\u00a12v1\nwhich occur on C in the order of their indices. Notice that N(e0) = N(x1)[N(x2)n\nfx1; x2g \u00bd VC because P is a maximal path for VR.\nIf N(e0) and N(e0)\n+ are not disjoint, then there exists a triangle or a desired\ncycle. Hence N(e0) \\N(e0)+ = ;. In the set of segments C \u00a1N(e0), there are two\nsegments v+s\n\u00a1!\nC v\u00a1s0 and v\n+\nt\n\u00a1!\nC v\u00a1t0 such that fvs; vt0g \u00bd N(x1) and fvs0 ; vtg \u00bd N(x2).\nThen vs+2; vt+2 =2 NC(e0) [ NC(e0)+; otherwise there is a desired cycle. Therefore,\nwe \u00afnd\nn\u00a1 2 \u00b8 jCj \u00b8 jN(e0)j+ jN(e0)+j+ jfvs+2; vt+2gj\n= jNC(x1)j+ jNC(x1)+j+ jNC(x2)j+ jNC(x2)+j+ jfvs+2; vt+2gj\n= 2(d(x1)\u00a1 1) + 2(d(x2)\u00a1 1) + 2 = 2(d(x1) + d(x2))\u00a1 2 > n\u00a1 2:\nThis is a contradiction.\nIf \u00b1 \u00b8 (n + 2)=4, then our proof is completed now by this claim. We divide our\nargument into two cases.\nCase 1. jNP (u1)\u00a1 \\NP (up)++j = 1\nLet fuig = NP (u1)\u00a1 \\NP (up)++. We show that d(ui) + d(ui\u00a11) > n=2. Because\nn \u00b8 jP j \u00b8 jNP (u1)j+ jNP (u1)\u00a1j+ jNP (up)+j+ j(NP (up) n up\u00a11)++j\n\u00a1jNP (u1)\u00a1 \\NP (up)++j\n= 2d(u1) + 2d(up)\u00a1 1\u00a1 1 \u00b8 \u00be4 \u00a1 2 \u00b8 n;\nit holds that\nVG = VP = NP (u1) [NP (u1)\u00a1 [NP (up)+ [ (NP (up) n up\u00a11)++ (3)\n8\nand that\nd(u1) + d(up) =\nn\n2\n+ 1: (4)\nHence the order n is even.\nBecause\nui\u00a13\n\u00c3\u00a1\nP u1ui+1uiui\u00a11ui\u00a12up\n\u00c3\u00a1\nP ui+2 2 P(VR);\nwe have ui\u00a13ui+2 =2 EG. If ui\u00a13u1 2 EG then\nui\u00a12 =2 NP (u1) [NP (u1)\u00a1 [NP (up)+ [ (NP (up) n up\u00a11)++:\nSee Figure 2i. This contradicts (3). Thus ui\u00a13u1 =2 EG. Especially, ui\u00a13 is not u2.\nui ui+2u1\n(ii)\nuiui-3u1 up\n(i)\nui-2 up\nFigure 2:\nSimilarly, if ui+2up 2 EG, then\nui+2 =2 NP (u1) [NP (u1)\u00a1 [NP (up)+ [ (NP (up) n up\u00a11)++:\nSee Figure 2ii. This also contradicts (3). Hence, ui+2up =2 EG and especially ui+2 6=\nup\u00a11. As u1up =2 EG, fu1; ui\u00a13; ui+2; upg is an independent set.\nLet x1x2 = ui\u00a11ui and w1 = ui\u00a13 and w2 = ui+2. Because d(u1)+d(up)+d(w1)+\nd(w2) \u00b8 \u00be4 \u00b8 n+ 2, we have\nd(w1) + d(w2) =\nn\n2\n+ 1\nby (2) and (4). Notice that none of u1; up; w1; w2 are adjacent to x1 nor x2; otherwise\neasily we can \u00afnd a triangle or a desired cycle. Hence for each i; j,\nd(u1) + d(up) + d(xi) + d(wj) \u00b8 n+ 2:\nAssume that n=2 is even, say 2l. Then d(u1) + d(up) = d(w1) + d(w2) = 2l + 1. By\nsymmetry, we can suppose that d(w1) \u00b7 l. Because\nd(u1) + d(up) + d(xi) + d(w1) \u00b8 4l + 2;\n9\nwe have d(xi) \u00b8 l + 1 for i = 1; 2. Hence d(x1) + d(x2) \u00b8 2l + 2 > n=2.\nSuppose n=2 is odd, say 2l + 1. Then d(u1) + d(up) = d(w1) + d(w2) = 2l + 2.\nBy symmetry, we may assume that d(w1) \u00b7 l + 1. Because\nd(u1) + d(u2) + d(w1) + d(xi) \u00b8 4l + 4;\nwe have d(xi) \u00b8 l + 1 for i = 1; 2. Thus d(x1) + d(x2) \u00b8 2l + 2 > n=2.\nTherefore, in either cases, d(ui) + d(ui\u00a11) > n=2, and hence we are done by\nClaim 1.\nCase 2. jNP (u1)\u00a1 \\NP (up)++j \u00b8 2.\nLet ui; uj 2 NP (u1)\u00a1 \\ NP (up)++ (i > j).

This completes the proof of Theorem 3.\n3 The Proof of Theorem 4\nLet G = (V;E) be a triangle-free graph with \u00b1 \u00b8 2 and \u00be4 \u00b8 n+2. If G is isomorphic\nto the exception of Theorem 3, then obviously for any two vertices, there is a cycle\ncontaining the speci\u00afed vertices. By Theorem 3 and the following lemma, it is\nenough to show that G is connected. A cycle C is called a swaying cycle of a subset\nS \u00b5 V if jC \\ Sj is maximum over all cycles of G.\nLemma 6. Let G be a connected graph such that for any path P , there exists a cycle\nC such that jP \u00a1Cj \u00b7 1. Then for any set S with at most \u00b1 vertices, there exists a\ncycle C such that S \u00bd VC.\nProof. Let S \u00b5 VG and let C be a longest swaying cycle of S. Suppose S \u00a1 C 6= ;.\nFor any vertex x 2 S \u00a1 C, there is a path Q joining x and C. Let P be a longest\npath containing VC[Q. Then there exists a cycle D such that jP \u00a1 Dj \u00b7 1. If\nx has neighbours in G \u00a1 C, then jP j \u00b8 jCj + 2 and so jDj \u00b8 jCj + 1. Because\njD\\Sj \u00b8 jC \\Sj, this contradicts the assumption that C is a longest swaying cycle.\nHence NG\u00a1C(x) = ;.\nBecause jC \\Sj < \u00b1 and dC(x) = d(x) \u00b8 \u00b1, there exist two vertices vi; vj 2 N(x)\nsuch that vi+1 = vj or v\n+\ni\n\u00a1!\nC v\u00a1j \u00bd C \u00a1 S. Hence the cycle vixvj\n\u00a1!\nC vi contains at\nleast jC \\ Sj+1 vertices of S. This contradicts the assumption that C is a swaying\ncycle.\nBefore we can prove that G is connected we \u00afrst need to show the following\nlemma.\nLemma 7. Let H be a connected component of a triangle-free graph G. If jHj \u00b8 3,\nthen H contains non-adjacent vertices x and y such that jHj \u00b8 maxf2d(x); 2d(y)g.\nProof. Let P = u1u2 : : : up be a longest path of H. If u1up =2 EG, then jP j \u00b8\njN(u1)j + jN(u1)\u00a1j + jfupgj = 2d(u1) + 1. Hence by symmetry, we have jHj \u00b8\nmaxf2d(u1) + 1; 2d(up) + 1g, and so fu1; upg is a desired pair. If u1up 2 EG, then\nu1up\u00a11 =2 EG, and VH = VP as P is a longest path. Then, we have\njP \u00a1 upj \u00b8 jN(up\u00a11) n upj+ j(N(up\u00a11) n up)+j+ ju1j = 2d(up\u00a11)\u00a1 1:\n12\nTherefore jHj \u00b8 2d(up\u00a11). As in the above case, we can have jHj \u00b8 2d(u1), and so\nfu1; up\u00a11g is a desired pair.\nBy using Lemma 7 we can show that G is indeed connected. This \u00afnishes the\nproof of Theorem 4.\nLemma 8. Let G be a triangle-free graph with \u00b1 \u00b8 2. If \u00be4 \u00b8 n + 1, then G is\nconnected.\nProof. Suppose G contains two connected components H1 and H2. Then the as-\nsumption that G is triangle-free and \u00b1 \u00b8 2 implies Hi \u00b8 3 for i = 1; 2. Therefore\nthere are non-adjacent vertices xi; yi in Hi such that jHij \u00b8 maxf2d(xi); 2d(yi)g\nfor i = 1; 2 by Lemma 7. Hence d(x1) + d(y1) + d(x2) + d(y2) \u00b8 \u00be4 \u00b8 n + 1. By\nsymmetry, we may assume d(x1) + d(x2) \u00b8 (n + 1)=2. Thus n \u00b8 jH1j + jH2j \u00b8\n2(d(x1) + d(x2)) \u00b8 n+ 1, a contradiction.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors wish to thank Professor Akira Saito for his comment.\nReferences\n[1] P. Ash and B.
