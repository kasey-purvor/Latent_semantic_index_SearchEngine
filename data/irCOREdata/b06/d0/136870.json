Peak vasodilatation is reached at 24 h (1) and\nneutrophil infiltration at 24\u201348 h (2\u20134), while dermal\ninfiltration by T lymphocytes may exhibit a later time\ncourse (5). Whereas prostaglandin (PG) E2 and nitric\noxide have roles in the vasodilatation (1, 6, 7), and\ncytokines, including interleukin-8, contribute to the\nleukocyte infiltration (3), the mediation of induction\nand resolution of the sunburn response is incompletely\nunderstood and is anticipated to involve a wider range\nof eicosanoids.\nSkin displays highly active metabolism of polyunsat-\nurated fatty acids (PUFAs), resulting in the production\nof eicosanoids that modulate physiological processes at\nlow concentrations and elicit inflammatory reactions at\nhigher levels (8). Activation of membrane phospho-\nlipase A2 by UVB effects release of fatty acids, notably\nthe \u0001 (n)-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n-6), and\npotentially the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA;\n20:5n-3), which has also been detected in human skin\n(9) (Scheme 1). Subsequently, these PUFAs may be\nmetabolized by cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxyge-\nnases (LOXs) to a wide range of eicosanoids and other\nlipid mediators. High COX-2, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX\nactivity is reported in epidermal cells, and infiltrating\nneutrophils may possess 5-LOX activity (8, 10).

Recently, UVB was\nreported to modulate 12-LOX and 15-LOX expression\nin a keratinocyte cell line, with reciprocal regulation of\nthese LOXs, suppressing 12-LOX, while up-regulating\n15-LOX (14). However, there is scant information\nconcerning the effects of UVB on LOX expression in\nhuman skin. Furthermore, through technical limita-\ntions, only a restricted range of UV-induced skin eico-\nsanoids have been examined to date; consequently,\ndetailed characterization of eicosanoids possessing\nproperties that potentially mediate the course of hu-\nman sunburn is lacking. Recently developed lipidomic\nassays based on electrospray ionization-liquid chroma-\ntography-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS-MS)\nnow permit assessment of a wide range of metabolites\n(15, 16).\nWe examined the expression and temporal relation-\nship of candidate eicosanoids that may mediate both\nthe early and later phases of vasodilatation and leuko-\ncyte infiltration, and potentially also the resolution\nphase, of the sunburn response, in 32 healthy humans.\nThe clinical (skin erythema) and histological (leuko-\ncyte infiltration) response was followed for 72 h, with\ndetailed characterization of cutaneous eicosanoid ex-\npression, and direct assessment of UVB regulation of\nCOX-2, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX expression over this\nperiod. We specifically examined for vasodilatory pro-\nstanoids derived through COX metabolism of both \u0001-6\nand \u0001-3 PUFAs (i.e., AA and EPA), and for a range of\nhydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) expressing che-\nmoattractant properties for neutrophils and lympho-\ncytes (17, 18) or anti-inflammatory properties (11).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSubjects\nThe study group comprised 32 healthy white Caucasian\nsubjects of mean age 40 yr (range 19 to 58 yr; 20 female) and\nsun-reactive skin types I-IV. Exclusions from the study were\nsunbathing or sunbed use in the prior 3 mo, photosensitizing\nor anti-inflammatory medication, and history of skin cancer\nor photosensitivity disorders. The study conformed to the\nDeclaration of Helsinki 2000, North Manchester Research\nEthics Committee approval was obtained, and all volunteers\ngave written informed consent.\nUV irradiation\nThe UV radiation (UVR) source used was a fluorescent UVB\nlamp, (Waldmann UV6; emission 290\u2013400 nm, peak 313 nm;\nHerbert Waldmann GmbH, Villingen-Schwenningen, Ger-\nmany). Minimal erythema dose (MED) testing was performed\nby applying a geometric series of UV doses ranging from 13 to\n128 mJ\/cm2 of erythemally weighted UVR in a horizontal row\nto the upper buttock skin. The MED was assessed at 24 h, and\ndefined as the lowest dose of UVB that resulted in detectable\nerythema. Volunteers were given MED-related doses in order\nto standardize the UVB challenge according to individual\nerythemal sensitivity. Three sites on the buttock skin were\nirradiated with 4 times the individual\u2019s MED of UVB, a dose\nsufficient to produce a well-defined clinical and histological\ninflammatory response. These sites were utilized for erythema\ntime course determination and suction blister fluid sampling\n(n\u000222 subjects) or skin-punch biopsy sampling for immuno-\nhistochemical investigations (n\u000210 subjects).\nAssessment of erythemal responses\nErythemal responses were quantified using a reflectance\ninstrument (Diastron, Andover, UK), which gives an ery-\nthema index related to the blood content of the superficial\ndermis. Triplicate measurements were taken from the test\nsites and adjacent unirradiated skin, and the means were\ncalculated.\nSuction blister sampling\nSuction blister fluid was sampled from unirradiated skin and\nfrom skin at 4, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h following a dose of UVB\n(4\u0003MED). Each volunteer provided a sample from an unir-\nradiated site on one buttock, and samples from 3 irradiated\nsites on the contralateral buttock, each site being sampled on\none occasion. Half of the volunteers were sampled at base-\nline, 4, 18, and 24 h, and the others at baseline, 24, 48, and\n72 h, with erythema readings taken at the same time points.\nSuction blister cups with 1-cm central aperture were applied\nwith a vacuum pressure of 250 mm Hg, as described previ-\nously (19). When blisters had formed (after \u000490 min), the\nfluid was aspirated with a 23-gauge needle, snap-frozen, and\nstored at \u000580\u00b0C until analysis.\nLipidomic analysis\nLipidomic analyses were performed as described by Masoodi\net al. (15, 16). Briefly, blister fluid samples (typical volumes\n50\u2013200 \u0006l) were diluted with methanol-water (15% wt\/wt) to\na final volume of 3 ml. Internal standards (40 ng PGB2-d4 and\n80 ng 12-HETE-d8; Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA)\nwere added to each sample. The resultant solutions were\nacidified to pH 3 and immediately applied to preconditioned\nsolid-phase extraction cartridges (C18-E; Phenomenex,\nMacclesfield, UK) to extract the lipid mediators. Chromato-\ngraphic analysis was performed on a C18 column (Luna 5\n\u0006m; Phenomenex) using a Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC pump\ncoupled to an ESI triple-quadrupole Quattro Ultima mass\nspectrometer (Waters, Elstree, UK). Instrument control and\ndata acquisition were performed using MassLynx 4.0 software\n(Waters). The following multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)\ntransitions were used for the assay of prostanoids and hydroxy\nfatty acids: PGE2, m\/z 351 \u0007 271; 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE2,\nm\/z 351\u0007 333, 349\u0007 113; PGF2\b, m\/z 353\u0007 193; 13,14-dihydro-\n15-keto PGF2\b, m\/z 353 \u0007 113; PGE1, m\/z 353 \u0007 317; 13,14-\ndihydro-15-keto-PGE1, m\/z 353 \u0007 335; PGE3, m\/z 349 \u0007 269;\nLTB4, m\/z 335\u0007 195; 11-HETE, m\/z 319 \u0007 167; 12-HETE, m\/z\n319 \u0007 179; 8-HETE, m\/z 319 \u0007 155; and 15-HETE, m\/z 319 \u0007\n175. Results are expressed as picograms of metabolite per\nmilligram of protein, based on calibration lines constructed\nwith commercially available eicosanoid standards (Cayman\nChemicals). Protein content was estimated using the Bio-Rad\nprotein assay kit with BSA as standard (Bio-Rad, Hemel\nHempstead, UK).\nImmunohistochemical assessment\nSkin-punch biopsies (5-mm diameter) were sampled from\nunirradiated skin and from skin at 4, 24, and 72 h following\n3948 Vol. 23 November 2009 RHODES ET AL.The FASEB Journal \u0001 www.fasebj.org\nexposure to 4 \u0003 MED of UVB (see above). Biopsies were\nsnap-frozen and stored at \u000580\u00b0C prior to immunohistochem-\nical analysis. Frozen sections (6 \u0006m) were air-dried before\nfixation in ice-cold acetone (Fisher Scientific UK, Loughbor-\nough, UK) for 10 min. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched\nin hydrated tissue sections with 0.5% H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich\nCo., Gillingham, UK) before blocking with 10% goat serum\n(Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. Primary antibody was added to the\nsections at the required dilution and incubated overnight at\n4\u00b0C. The primary antibodies used in this study were as follows.\nNeutrophil elastase: MAB 1056, dilution 1:70 (Chemicon\nEurope, Chandlers Ford, UK); CD3\t: NCL-CD3, dilution 1:40\n(NovoCastra Reagents, Leica Biosystems, Newcastle on Tyne,\nUK); 12-LOX: ab23678, dilution 1:200 (Abcam plc, Cam-\nbridge, UK); 15-LOX: 10004454, dilution 1:100 (Cayman\nChemical, Boldon, UK); COX-2: ALX-210-712-1, dilution\n1:100 (Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland). After wash-\ning in PBS, skin sections were incubated with biotinylated\nanti-mouse secondary antibody (DakoCytomation, Ely, UK)\nfor 30 min, washed in PBS, and incubated with streptavidin\nperoxidase (DakoCytomation) for 30 min. Sections were\ndeveloped using aminoethylcarbazole chromogen (Vector\nLaboratories, Peterborough, UK) for 5\u201310 min, washed in\ndistilled water, lightly counterstained in Meyers hematox-\nylin (Sigma-Aldrich), and mounted in glycergel mounting\nmedium (DakoCytomation). The sections were assessed\nusing a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope at \u0003200 view and a\nNikon Digital Sight DS-U1 camera (Nikon UK, Kingston on\nThames, UK).\nQuantification of immunohistochemical staining\nSlides were masked prior to assessment. Neutrophils and\nCD3\t cells were counted in 3 randomly selected epidermal\nand dermal high-power fields (hpf) at \u0003400. This technique\nwas employed for each individual at each of 4 time points.\nCOX and LOX staining was quantified in terms of relative\nstaining intensity, according to the following scoring system:\n0 \u0002 no staining, 1 \u0002 weak staining, 2 \u0002 moderate staining,\n3 \u0002 intense staining. 12-LOX, 15-LOX, and COX-2 were\ngraded in epidermal and dermal hpf at\u0003200. Assessment was\nmade for each individual at each of the 4 time points.\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed with StatsDirect (Stats Direct, Altrincham,\nUK). Nonparametric data were analyzed using the Kruskal-\nWallis test with adjustment for multiple comparisons, and\nparametric data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA with\nBonferroni correction. All results are compared with levels in\nnon-UV-exposed tissue unless otherwise stated. Statistical\nsignificance was accepted at the P \n 0.05 level.\nRESULTS\nUVB-erythema time course\nErythema was clinically visible at 4 h following UVB\nexposure, with a significant elevation of the erythema\nindex at this time point, rising from a mean \u000b se\nbaseline value of 39.9 \u000b 3.6 to 97.2 \u000b 13.4 at 4 h\n(P\n0.001). The erythema index peaked at 18\u201324 h\nafter UVB exposure (160.8\u000b6.3 and 171.1\u000b3.6, respec-\ntively) and remained elevated at 72 h (156.6\u000b6.4,\nP\n0.001) (Fig. 1).\nEffect of UVB on COX-mediated eicosanoid\nproduction\nPGE2 and metabolite\nAnalysis of suction blister fluid from unexposed skin\nrevealed baseline levels of PGE2 and its inactive metab-\nolite 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE2 of 26.83 \u000b 3.1 and\n31.7 \u000b 2.63 pg\/mg protein, respectively. Following\nUVB, PGE2 levels were above the baseline level at all\ntime points 4\u201372 h, with statistically significant eleva-\ntion at 18 and 24 h (32.81\u000b5.13 and 38.05\u000b3.95\npg\/mg protein, respectively; P\u00020.02) (Fig. 2A), while\n13,14-dihydro-5-keto PGE2 was significantly elevated at\n72 h (50.45\u000b6.86 pg\/mg protein; P\u00020.02) (Fig. 2B).\nPGF2\b and metabolite\nBaseline levels of PGF2\b and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto\nPGF2\b were 30.47 \u000b 3.53 and 0.81 \u000b 0.81 pg\/mg\nprotein, respectively. Prostaglandin F2\b also showed a\nsignificant rise at 18 h (44.84\u000b6.66 pg\/mg protein;\nP\u00020.03), but in contrast to PGE2, it returned to\nbaseline levels by 24 h (30.1\u000b2.57 pg\/mg protein)\n(Fig. 2C). However, the inactive PGF2\b metabolite\n13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGF2, was significantly ele-\nvated at 48 and 72 h (17.62\u000b4.39 pg\/mg protein,\nP\u00020.003 and 13.65\u000b5.02 pg\/mg protein, P\u00020.049,\nrespectively) (Fig. 2D).\nPGE1 and metabolite\nBaseline levels of PGE1 and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGE1\nwere 17.14 \u000b 3.58 and 7.60 \u000b 2.18 pg\/mg protein,\nrespectively.

Our data sup-\nport that a range of prostanoids, including n-3 PUFA-\nderived PGE3, in addition to n-6 PUFA-derived PGE2,\nare produced during the sunburn reaction. They fur-\nther suggest that the potent chemoattractants 8-HETE,\n11-HETE, and 12-HETE may contribute to the leuko-\ncyte influx, while the anti-inflammatory metabolite\n15-HETE may serve to limit or aid resolution of the\ninflammation. Eicosanoid-producing enzymes 12-LOX\nand 15-LOX are both up-regulated, in contrast to\nrecent findings in a keratinocyte cell line (14). Expres-\nsion of COX and LOX does not necessarily reflect\nenzyme activity. However, we observe that while COX-2\nshows significantly increased expression only at 24 h,\n12- and 15-LOX show sustained increase in expression\nat 72 h, consistent with the earlier and later peaks of\ntheir respective prostanoid and HETE metabolites dur-\ning the sunburn response (Scheme 2).\nOur results indicate that after an early increase in n-6\nPUFA-derived prostaglandins PGE2, PGF2\b, and PGE1\nfollowing UVB exposure, these potent mediators are\nenzymatically inactivated (Fig. 2), as reflected by in-\ncreases in their respective 13,14-dihydro-15-keto deriv-\natives.

Intradermal injection of PGF2\b, as\nwith PGE1 and PGE2, can produce skin erythema (21,\n22), but the relevance of these findings is unclear in\nview of the higher than physiological doses used; more-\nover, PGF2\b is described as a vasoconstrictor in some\nsystems (23). Whereas we did not directly detect a\nsignificant increase in the COX-metabolized vasodila-\ntor PGE1, derived from dihommogammalinolenic acid,\nits inactive metabolite was significantly elevated at\n48\u201372 h after UVB exposure, indicating the earlier\nelevation of the mediator.

Thus, sunburn is a self-resolving\nmodel of injury exhibiting preparation for its resolu-\ntion through the quick deactivation of proinflamma-\ntory signals and activation of repair mechanisms.\nInterestingly, we found significant elevation of the\nn-3 PUFA-derived PGE3, from 18 to 48 h following UV.\nThis mediator has not previously been reported in\nhuman skin, although its discovery is consistent with\ndetection of the precursor n-3 PUFAs EPA and docosa-\nhexaenoic acid (DHA) in human epidermal phospho-\nFigure 7.

In many respects, PGE3 is believed to\npossess similar functions to PGE2, but with reduced\npotency (31), and thus PGE3 may contribute to the\nerythema following UVB, although it may also reduce\nthe efficacy of PGE2 through acting as its partial ago-\nnist. Although neither PGE2 nor PGE3 was significantly\nelevated at 72 h, they appear not to have returned to\nbaseline level at this time point, and the combined\neffects of the vasodilatory prostaglandins, together with\nnitric oxide (1, 7), could continue to influence sun-\nburn erythema at the later time point. Cyclooxygenase\nand nitric oxide synthase inhibitors each reduce the\nerythemal component of the sunburn response at least\nto 48 h after UVB exposure (1).\nDuring sunburn, neutrophils accumulate in the der-\nmis (2, 3) where they exert proinflammatory activities,\nincluding further release of mediators with chemoat-\ntractant properties. The infiltration occurs from 4 h\nafter UVB onward and is consistent with our observa-\ntions of the increase in a range of chemoattractant\nHETE. Neither 11-HETE nor 8-HETE has to our knowl-\nedge previously been reported in human skin, while\n8-HETE has been detected in mouse skin (32). Their\nderivation is uncertain but potentially results from a\ncombination of LOX, CYP450, and nonenzymatic oxi-\ndation pathways (11). Because both are potent neutro-\nphil chemoattractants in in vitro and experimental\nmodels in other systems (18), they are anticipated to\nmake a substantial contribution to the leukocyte che-\nmoattraction in sunburn, particularly as there is signif-\nicant elevation of 11-HETE as early as 4 h. The potent\nkeratinocyte-derived chemoattractant 12-HETE pro-\nduces a mixed neutrophilic and mononuclear infiltrate\nfollowing intradermal injection (33) and has been\nshown in vitro to be a chemoattractant for lymphocytes\nin addition to neutrophils (17). While 12-HETE has\nFigure 8. Expression of 15-LOX in the epidermis and dermis\nfollowing UVB irradiation.

(35) found 12-HETE elevated at 24 but\nnot 72 h after UV exposure in a study of skin blister\nfluid in 6 subjects, and Grundmann et al. (36) detected\n12-HETE at 3 but not 24 h in dermal microdialysate in\n3 subjects. Our findings, in a larger subject group, of\nhigher and more sustained 12-HETE up-regulation,\ncontrast with these reports and support a significant\nrole for this 12-LOX-derived metabolite in the sunburn\nresponse, potentially including the prolonged (to 72 h)\nCD3\t cell infiltration.\nThe neutrophil chemoattractants LTB4, believed to\nplay a role in a range of skin inflammatory conditions\n(37), and 5-HETE were undetectable. It is conceivable\nthat these mediators were present in a cellular compart-\nment inaccessible for sampling via the suction blister\nmethod, since a slight although nonstatistically signifi-\ncant UV-associated rise in 5-HETE was detected in\ndermal microdialysate (36). However, LTB4 has been\ndetected in suction blister fluid in a range of other\nskin inflammatory states (38, 39), and our data\ncorrespond with earlier reports of lack of up-regula-\ntion of LTB4 and 5-HETE following UVB exposure of\nmouse skin (40, 41). UVB-up-regulated PGE2 may\ninhibit 5-LOX and thereby production of the LT4\nseries (26), while 15-HETE may also inhibit LTB4\nsynthesis (42). Thus, a specific proinflammatory pro-\nfile of LOX metabolite expression is apparent in\nsunburn, distinct from that observed in other skin\ninflammatory states, providing evidence against the\nsupposition that \u201cLTB4 may be a prerequisite for\nemigration of leukocyte into dermis\u201d (43).\nA further novel, and intriguing, finding was the\nsignificant UVB up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory\neicosanoid 15-HETE, exhibiting a later response with\nmean levels observed to double between 48 and 72 h\nand potentially rising beyond 72 h. This 15-LOX me-\ntabolite has been shown to inhibit the synthesis of\nproinflammatory eicosanoids PGE2 and 12-HETE in\nin vitro models (14, 44) and to inhibit the activity of\n12-LOX in epidermis (45) and 5-LOX in neutrophils\n(44). Hence, the later elevation of this mediator could\nreflect a role in the resolution of sunburn, including\nlimitation of the neutrophil influx. Other eicosanoids\ncould potentially also possess restorative roles at later\ntime points, including, paradoxically, 12-HETE, which\nis still rising at 72 h, and is described to induce\nfibroblast chemotaxis (46).\nIn summary, we have observed overlapping phases in\nlipid mediator profile during the sunburn response,\nfrom mainly COX-derived proinflammatory products\nin the early stages, to predominantly LOX products\nduring the leukocyte infiltration phases and resolution\nphase, in association with UVB up-regulation of COX-2\nand 12- and 15-LOX expression (Scheme 2). This study\nsupports involvement of a specific pattern of eicosanoid\nproducts in this self-limiting inflammatory reaction.\nWhile both n-3 and n-6 PUFA-derived prostanoids are\nelevated and may contribute to the vasodilatation re-\nsponse, 8-HETE, 11-HETE, and 12-HETE are candidate\nmediators of UVB-induced leukocyte chemoattraction.\nOur findings of an elevation of the anti-inflammatory\nmetabolite 15-HETE in the later stages of this response\nwarrants further examination of its potential role in\nresolving the inflammation. A robust resolution re-\nsponse may be important in protection against patho-\nlogical states linked with sunburn, namely skin cancer\nand types of photosensitivity.\nThe authors acknowledge The Wellcome Trust, project\nWT077714, for funding this research.
