However, until a short\ntime ago, there had been clear evidence only for the forma-\ntion of copper and silver nitrides.5\u201311 Although attempts to\nform gold nitrides have been recorded for the past 20 years,\nthis compound has been observed only recently by \u0160iller et\nal.12 In that work, irradiation of a gold surface with low-\nenergy s500 eVd nitrogen ions was used to produce a surface\nnitride layer which was then investigated with high-\nresolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Two N1s core\nlines were observed after irradiation. Using angle-resolved\nmeasurements these two lines were interpreted in terms of\nnitrogen chemically bound to gold and molecular nitrogen\ntrapped beneath the gold surface in bubbles. It has been\nsuggested12 that the main reasons why previous research had\nnot been able to produce\/detect gold nitrides are that the\nincident ion energies employed were too high and\/or that the\nsensitivity of the analytical techniques used in those studies\nwas not sufficient.\nIn the work reported here we employ synchrotron radia-\ntion excited photoemission spectroscopy (PES) to study the\ncore lines of both Au and N after ion irradiation and to ex-\namine changes in valence-band spectra induced by nitride\nformation. The high signal and resolution which are offered\nby synchrotron based PES measurements enable us to iden-\ntify changes in the Au4d line associated with irradiation and\nto resolve two components associated with chemically bound\nnitrogen, which have not been previously detected. Ab initio\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to de-\ntermine the structure, stability, and electronic properties of\ngold nitride structures of the most likely stoichiometry,\nAu3N. We find that the most stable structure is a novel tri-\nclinic crystal structure of a significantly lower energy than\nthe anti-ReO3 expected from a simple consideration of the\nperiodic table. This structure is determined to be metallic, of\nimportance to possible applications.\nEXPERIMENTAL\nExperiments were performed using the vacuum ultraviolet\nbeamline at the ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility in\nTrieste, Italy. The end station consists of a two chamber ul-\ntrahigh vacuum system with a base pressure better than 5\n310\u221210 mbar. The preparation chamber contains an anneal-\ning stage, mass spectrometer, low-energy electron-diffraction\n(LEED) optics, and a differentially pumped ion gun. An\nOmicron EA125 hemispherical electron energy analyzer\nmounted in the analysis chamber was used to record the pho-\ntoemission spectra. Nitride films were formed on the (110)\nsurface of a gold single crystal which was cleaned in situ by\nsputtering with Ar ions of kinetic energy 500 eV for 35 min.\nThe sample was then annealed at 500\u00b0C for 30 min to re-\nstore surface crystallinity. The cleanliness and crystallinity of\nthe sample were then examined with PES and LEED, respec-\ntively.\nIn order to form a surface nitride layer the Aus110d sur-\nface was exposed to nitrogen ion irradiation using an ion\nkinetic energy of 500 eV. The ion gun was fed with 99.999%\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 70, 045414 (2004)\n0163-1829\/2004\/70(4)\/045414(5)\/$22.50 \u00a92004 The American Physical Society70 045414-1\npure N2 gas and adjusted to ensure that the entire surface of\nAu crystal was evenly irradiated. During the implantation the\nchamber pressure rose to 1310\u22125 mbar. A quadrupole mass\nspectrometer was used to monitor the composition of the\nchamber gas during implantation\u2014no significant rise of the\nsignals due to water or carbon monoxide were observed.\nMass spectroscopy indicated that the dominant ion species\nwas N+, however, there was no control or selection of the ion\nspecies impinging upon the gold surface during irradiation,\nand in consequence N2\n+ ions may also be present.\nIrradiation was performed at normal incidence with mea-\nsured ion currents of 3.5\u20134 mA, and the sample was held at\nroom temperature. Core-level photoemission studies were\nperformed using a photon energy of 500 eV, while valence-\nband measurements employed a photon energy of 40 eV.\nThe total resolution for core level is 0.15 eV and for valence\nband is 50 meV. Binding energies in core-level spectra were\ncalibrated by taking the binding energy of the main Au4d5\/2\nline as 334.8 eV (Ref. 13) while binding energies valence-\nband spectra were referred to the Fermi level of the sample.\nCore-level spectra were obtained at grazing emission (75\u00b0\noff normal) unless otherwise stated, while valence-band\nspectra were acquired in normal-emission geometry.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIn Fig. 1(a) a N1s core-level photoemission spectrum ob-\ntained from an Aus110d surface irradiated with 500 eV nitro-\ngen ions to a dose of 4990 mC is presented. Two peaks, at\nbinding energies 396.7\u00b10.2 eV and 397.7\u00b10.2 eV can be\nobserved, with the binding energy values obtained by fitting\nthe peaks with Gaussian-Lorentzian line shapes and a Shirley\nbackground. The peak at 396.7\u00b10.2 eV has a binding energy\nvery close to that observed for chemisorbed nitrogen on\nCus110d, which lies in the range 396.5\u2013396.8 eV, depending\nupon coverage14 and has been previously assigned to the\npresence of nitrogen chemically bound to Au.12 The second\ncomponent was not previously resolved due to the lower\nresolution and signal-to-noise ratio available in the original\nmeasurements.12 Both peaks have approximately the same\narea, but their different widths are reflected in differing peak\nheights. Spectra from the same surface obtained in normal-\nemission geometry show the same peak position and line\nshape, but a larger overall intensity. However, due to the\nroughness inherent in the irradiated surface it is not possible\nto reach a conclusion regarding the uniformity of the near-\nsurface region of the sample. Based upon the broadening of\nthe Au4d5\/2 line, discussed below, we estimate that the upper\nlimit for Au in the form of AuNx within the probe depth of\nour experiment is ,18% (given surface roughness, we ex-\npect the probe depth to be between ,1 nm at grazing emis-\nsion and ,3 nm at normal emission for a smooth surface).\nCalculations using SRIM-2000 (Ref. 15) indicate that N ions\nwith 500 eV kinetic energy penetrate to an average depth of\n,2 nm suggesting that nitride formation in the near-surface\nregion is incomplete in the irradiation dose range studied and\nthat the surface region most likely consists of both unreacted\ngold and gold nitride (for complete nitride formation we\nwould expect, from the differing depths associated with ion\npenetration and electron inelastic mean free path, that\n,60\u2013100% of the gold detected in core-level spectra should\nbe in the form of a nitride).\nA N1s core-level spectrum obtained from an Aus110d sur-\nface exposed to a nitrogen ion dose of 900 mC at 2 keV and\n300 K is shown in Fig. 1(b). The N1s line assigned to gold\nnitride is absent. A weak feature, labeled A, is observed at a\nbinding energy of 402.2\u00b10.1 eV. This peak has also been\ndetected in previous experiments,12 and was assigned to the\npresence of molecular nitrogen trapped beneath the surface\nof the gold, in the form of bubbles. The absence of the core\nline associated with the formation of gold nitride in this\nspectrum can be attributed to the higher incident energy em-\nployed during irradiation of this sample. Upon irradiation,\nnitride formation and implantation compete with sputtering\nof surface material, and at sufficiently high incident ion en-\nergy the latter process can dominate. The absence of any core\nlines associated with chemisorbed nitrogen species at higher\nincident ion energies indicates that these species are unlikely\nto arise from contamination during the irradiation process.\nChanges in the Au4d5\/2 line shape were also observed\nafter nitrogen ion irradiation, and Fig. 2 shows the results of\nirradiation to an ion dose of 4990 mC at 500 eV. A clear\nbroadening of the Au4d5\/2 peak towards higher binding en-\nergies with nitrogen ion bombardment is seen. Examination\nof Au4d5\/2 spectra obtained from clean samples irradiated\nFIG. 1.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 70, 045414 (2004)\n045414-2\nwith Ar ions show a similar broadening prior to annealing.\nAlthough the high binding energy broadening of the Au4d5\/2\nline after nitrogen ion irradiation appears larger than that for\nAr irradiation, it is impossible to accurately disentangle the\neffects of surface roughness from those which may be asso-\nciated with a new component arising from reaction with ni-\ntrogen. Since a substantial proportion of the Au4d signal\narises from gold which is not bound to nitrogen we cannot, at\npresent, experimentally determine the stoichiometry of the\ngold nitride phase(s). However, as mentioned above, the\nbroadening of the Au4d5\/2 line does enable us to place an\nupper limit of ,18% on the fraction of gold chemically\nbound to nitrogen over the probe depth of the photoemission\nexperiment. In Fig. 3, N1s spectra for nitrogen ion doses of\n4990 mC and 500 mC at 500 eV (triangles and circles, re-\nspectively) are presented. As expected a rise in both compo-\nnents as a function of increasing ion dose is observed. From\nthe data it appears that both components grow equally rap-\nidly as a function of ion dose, although further measurements\nare required at low doses to verify that the ratio of the N1s\npeaks remains constant over the nitride formation process.\nIn Fig. 4 valence-band spectra before (solid line) and after\n(dotted line) a nitrogen ion dose of 4990 mC at 500 eV are\npresented. A tail in the valence-band intensity close to the\nFermi level is observed in the energy range 0.1\u20131.8 eV in\naddition to a new peak at 3.1 eV (denoted by an arrow). It is\nknown that a surface state of d-type character is located near\nthe G point along G-X16,17 on Aus110d surfaces. Upon sput-\ntering and ion implantation into the gold crystal, the surface\nbecomes rough and these surface states will be strongly\nmodified, which may explain the appearance of this broad\n\u201ctail\u201d in the spectra. The new state at 3.1 eV might be due to\nnitrogen-gold bonding (see discussion of theoretical data be-\nlow).\nAnnealing experiments were undertaken on a sample irra-\ndiated with an ion dose of 770 mC to explore the stability of\nthe surface gold nitride, as shown in Fig. 5 (obtained in\nnormal-emission geometry). Before considering the effects\nFIG. 2. Au4d core-level spectra before (solid line) and after\n(dotted line) a nitrogen ion dose of 4990 mC at 500 eV taken at\ngrazing emission.\nFIG. 3.

Both spectra were obtained\nin normal-emission geometry.\nNITROGEN ION IRRADIATION OF Aus110d:\u0085 PHYSICAL REVIEW B 70, 045414 (2004)\n045414-3\nof annealing itself, it is worth noting that the lower ion dose\nproduces N1s lines with a similar ratio, line shape, and area\nto that observed for the 4990 mC ion dose. This suggests that\nthe surface nitride is formed in an equilibrium in which a\nsteady rate of formation is balanced by erosion of the surface\nthrough ion sputtering. The observation that higher irradia-\ntion energies do not lead to nitride formation, as discussed\nabove, reinforces the assertion that higher rates of sputtering\nat increased ion energies prevent the formation of observable\nquantities of gold nitride. Upon annealing to ,200\u00b0C the\nlower binding energy N1s component is strongly reduced in\nintensity, indicating that the nitrogen species associated with\nthe two N1s lines have significantly different stability. Since\nwe took the spectra shown in Fig. 5 in normal-emission ge-\nometry which is bulk sensitive (electron escape depth\n,3 nm), we suggest that most probably the species associ-\nated with the lower binding energy N1s component desorbs\nrather than diffuses into the bulk of the sample. We can,\ntherefore, draw the conclusion that the N1s lines are most\nprobably associated with nitrogen atoms in different bonding\nconfigurations (and possibly phases) within the surface layer\nand that the nitride phase associated with lower binding en-\nergy has a limited thermal stability.\nTo further investigate the nature of the nitride phase(s)\nformed during ion implantation we have undertaken ab initio\nstudies. The stability of Cu3N (Ref. 18) and Ag3N (Ref. 19)\nsuggests that a Au3N stoichiometry is a good starting point\nfor further investigation. Using DFT with first-principles\npseudopotentials it is possible to directly compare the total\nenergy for different Au3N crystal structures, including com-\nplex crystal structures with bases consisting of many Au3N\nunits, and to identify the optimum lattice parameters for\nthese structures. In this paper we present results for a wide\nrange of possible Au3N structures obtained using the AIMPRO\ncode,20 in which a Gaussian orbital basis set is used with the\nseparable dual-space pseudopotentials of Hutter et al.21 Al-\nthough we are able to compare a large number of different\nstructures, and to identify those with lowest energy, it is of\ncourse not possible to be sure that the global minimum has\nbeen located (we can sample only a finite subset of the infi-\nnite parameter space available). What we can do, however, is\nexamine a wide range of structures which might be expected\nto be of low energy (for example, those which other A3B\ncompounds assume), to identify which of those are the most\nlikely candidates for the true crystal structure, and to elimi-\nnate those structures which are not energetically favorable.\nThe starting point for our study of possible Au3N struc-\ntures is the so-called anti-ReO3 structure as established for\nCu3N.18,22,23 From their positions in the periodic table one\nmight expect gold nitride to be similar to copper nitride, and\nto take on this crystal structure. In addition, a wide range of\nstructures corresponding to other known inorganic crystals\nwere studied,24 including the cubic structures of Fe3Al,\nGeV3, and skutterudite (with a Au24N8 basis), and the hex-\nagonal close packed structure of RhF3. For each structure the\ntotal energy was minimized with respect to lattice parameters\nand atom positions within the unit cell. The stability of struc-\ntures was also tested by perturbing the atom positions and\nseeing whether the structure would recover. The volume of\nthe parameter space sampled was further increased by per-\nforming total-energy minimization in which the lattice vec-\ntors were allowed to change freely, optimizing lattice sym-\nmetry and dimensions simultaneously.\nThe anti-ReO3 structure, a simple cubic structure with the\nlattice parameter 8.010 a.u., was indeed found to be a stable\nform for Au3N. However, this was not found to be the\nlowest-energy structure for Au3N in the parameter space\nsampled. A crystal structure was obtained following the re-\nlaxation of the atomic positions within a perturbed hexagonal\nclose-packed unit cell. A further energy reduction was ob-\ntained upon combined optimization of the lattice vectors and\natomic positions, in which the remaining hexagonal lattice\nsymmetry was broken. The final lowest-energy structure, a\ntriclinic lattice with a two unit basis, is shown in Fig. 6 and\nits primitive unit cell basis vectors are listed in Table I. This\nstructure has a total energy of 1.0 eV per Au3N unit below\nthat of the anti-ReO3 structure.\nAlthough the triclinic and anti-ReO3 structures of Au3N\nare found to be stable with respect to perturbation of the\ngeometric position of the atoms within the respective unit\ncells, it is found that both structures are about 3.25 eV higher\nin energy than metallic gold and molecular nitrogen per\nAu3N unit cell. The instability of the gold nitride structures\nwith respect to gold metal and N2 indicates why a stimulated\nreaction is necessary to form the (metastable) phase(s) ob-\nserved in the photoemission experiments. The observation, in\nexperiment, of two distinct N1s lines associated with nitro-\ngen species with differing thermal stabilities makes it tempt-\ning to assign them to different structural phases of AuNx,\ngiven the stability of both the triclinic and anti-ReO3 phases\nof Au3N. However, there is also the possibility that the less\nFIG. 6. The triclinic structure for Au3N, which we find at the\nlowest energy of those considered.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 70, 045414 (2004)\n045414-4\nstable N atoms are chemisorbed species located at the gold\nsurface, while the more strongly bound species correspond to\nsubsurface bulklike gold nitride.\nOne of the key physical properties with regard to the pos-\nsible applications of gold nitride is its conductivity. The elec-\ntronic band structure for the optimum structure is shown in\nFig. 7 together with the associated density of states. Our\nmodel therefore predicts that the Au3N crystal structure ob-\ntained will be metallic, in contrast to the anti-ReO3 form of\nAu3N which we predict to be an indirect band-gap semicon-\nductor. It is of note that an increased density of states due to\ngold nitride formation with respect to pristine gold is pre-\ndicted in the 3\u20134 eV energy region (see Fig. 7) which might\ncorrespond to the new state at observed ,3.1 eV in valence-\nband photoemission (Fig. 4).\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, photoemission investigations of Aus110d\nsurfaces irradiated with nitrogen ions show that at suffi-\nciently low s500 eVd incident ion energy two chemically\nbound nitrogen species with N1s lines at 396.7\u00b10.2 eV and\n397.7\u00b10.2 eV binding energy can be observed. Experiments\nundertaken at incident ion energies of 2 keV show no chemi-\ncally bound nitrogen species indicating that an increased rate\nof surface sputtering prevents the formation of a detectable\nquantity of nitride. Theoretical investigations show that for\nthe composition of Au3N the most energetically favorable\nstructure is not the anti-ReO3 structure of Cu3N, as might be\nexpected from a simple consideration of the periodic table,\nbut a triclinic crystal structure of significantly lower energy.\nHowever, both structures are stable with respect to perturba-\ntion. The (meta) stability of more than one crystal structure\nfor the Au3N composition suggests that the different thermal\nstability of the two nitrogen species observed in photoemis-\nsion spectra may arise from the formation of more than one\ngold nitride phase.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nL.\u0160., M.G.W., M.J.S., and P.R.B. are grateful to EPSRC\nfor financial support.\n*Corresponding author: Electronic address: Lidija.Siller@ncl.ac.uk\n1 Y.
