Chen,1 Michael Schulz,2 Gang Lu,3 and Larry R. Lyons4\nReceived 15 July 2002; revised 3 February 2003; accepted 20 February 2003; published 13 May 2003.\n[1] Recent measurements show that magnetospheric convection electric fields during the\nmain phases of magnetic storms are much more complicated in spatial structure than the\nelectric fields that have generally been used to model formation of the stormtime ring\ncurrent. To investigate the transport effects of such more realistic stormtime electric fields\non magnetospheric charged particles, we map the Assimilative Model of Ionospheric\nElectrodynamics (AMIE) electric potential functions analytically with a simple magnetic\nfield model at selected times of interest during several magnetic storms from 1997\u20131998\nand during the extremely large storm of July 2000. We calculated corresponding contours\nof constant Hamiltonian (kinetic plus potential energy) for first invariant values that\nrange from 0 to 30 MeV\/G (representative of equatorially mirroring cold plasma, ring\ncurrent, and radiation-belt ions and electrons). These equatorial contours would constitute\ndrift paths if the electric field were truly constant in time. We thus calculated how far along\nsuch quasi-drift paths the corresponding particles would have drifted after specific\namounts of time, and we compare these quasi-drift characteristics with those obtained\nfrom a simple semiempirical model of the convection electric field. We find considerable\nvariability among stormtime equatorial quasi-drift paths, reflecting the known variability\nof AMIE equipotentials. Patterns of equatorial quasi-drift in the simplified electric field\nmodel are (by construction) symmetric about the dawn-dusk meridian. During the main\nphases of storms, the equatorial electric field derived from AMIE tends to be strongest\nin an MLT sector several hours wide on the night side. This concentration of AMIE\nequipotentials provides a channel for rapid transport (requiring \u000120\u201330 min) for ions with\nfirst invariant values representative of the ring current population from the nightside\nneutral line to low L values (\u00013\u20134) near dusk, where the partial ring current forms.\nDuring the extremely large \u2018\u2018Bastille Day\u2019\u2019 storm of 15 July 2000 (minimum Dst =\n\u0002300 nT) the drift patterns derived from AMIE show penetration of ions to as low as\nL \u0001 2. This deep penetration of ring current ions could help to account for the very strong\nring current that was observed during this storm. The quasi-steady state drift properties\nhelp us anticipate the implications of a more realistic electric field model for the\nparticle drifts that lead to the formation of the stormtime ring current.

Introduction\n[2] The magnetospheric electric field plays a critically\nimportant role in the transport of particles within the inner\nmagnetosphere. Electric fields affect particle drift trajectories\nand drift rates. They thereby determine many important\nplasma signatures of the inner magnetosphere (e.g., the\nlocation of the plasmapause, the circulation of cold plasma\nwithin the plasmasphere, and the penetration of the plasma\nsheet into the inner magnetosphere to form the ring current).\nMany investigators have used heuristic electric field models\nderived from an electrostatic potential \u0001 \/ Lgsin f, where f\nis themagnetic local time and g is an adjustable index, to trace\nparticle drifts in the inner magnetosphere. The case g = 1\n[Nishida, 1966; Brice, 1967] corresponds to an equatorially\nuniform electric field in the inner magnetosphere and has\nbeen used [e.g., Kavanagh et al., 1968; Chen, 1970] to\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO. A5, 1180, doi:10.1029\/2002JA009584, 2003\n1Space Sciences Applications Laboratory, The Aerospace Corporation,\nEl Segundo, California, USA.\n2Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center, Palo Alto, California,\nUSA.\n3High Altitude Observatory, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n4Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of California, Los\nAngeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.\nCopyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/03\/2002JA009584$09.00\nSMP 5 - 1\nmodel the penetration of low-energy particles. The case g = 2\n[Volland, 1973, 1975; Stern, 1974, 1975] corresponds to a\nshielded electric field and has been used in several ring\ncurrent modeling studies [e.g., Ejiri, 1978, Smith et al.,\n1979; Fok et al., 1995; Jordanova et al., 1994; Ebihara\nand Ejiri, 2000]. Chen et al. [1993, 1994, 2000] have used a\nsuperposition of quiescent shielded (Volland-Stern) and\nimpulsive unshielded (Brice-Nishida) electric fields to trace\ndrift paths of ions that form the stormtime ring current.\n[3] Recent CRRES and DMSP satellite measurements\n[Wygant et al., 1998; Rowland and Wygant, 1998; Anderson\net al., 2001], along with Millstone Hill radar measurements\n[Yeh et al., 1991], show that stormtime magnetospheric\nelectric fields are significantly more complicated in spatial\nstructure than the above-mentioned models. We would\nexpect this greater complexity of the stormtime magneto-\nspheric electric field to have significant effects on the\ninward transport of plasmasheet particles to form the\nstormtime ring current. However, the cited measurements\nhave been too limited in spatial coverage to provide an\nimproved global magnetospheric electric field model for\ntracing stormtime particle drifts. Time-averaged semiempir-\nical models [e.g., Maynard et al., 1983; Weimer, 1995]\ndependent on Kp are instructive for orientation but are of\nlimited use for modeling particle drifts during individual\nmagnetic storms. Kistler and Larson [2000] and Jordanova\net al. [2001] have found the IMF-dependent parameterized\nelectric field model of Weimer [1996] in a dipole magnetic\nfield to produce ion fluxes in the ring current region that\nagree better with observations than those produced in the\nVolland-Stern model for a few storm events. However, the\nWeimer [1996] model has limited statistics for stormtime\nconditions. We have decided instead to use AMIE, the\nAssimilative Model of Ionospheric Electrodynamics [Rich-\nmond and Kamide, 1988], for modeling particle drifts in the\npresent study and for simulating the stormtime ring current\nin the near future.\n[4] AMIE fits ionospheric potentials to electric field data\nprovided by ground-based magnetometers, radars, and sat-\nellites. Ground-based magnetometer chains provide fairly\ngood spatial coverage, especially at latitudes above 50\u0002. In\nsitu electric field data may provide better latitudinal cover-\nage but are typically sparse in local-time coverage. None-\ntheless, for a given event we expect this assimilative model\nto provide a more realistic representation of stormtime\nelectric fields than simplified heuristic [Volland, 1973,\n1975; Stern, 1974, 1975; Maynard and Chen, 1975] or\ntime-averaged semiempirical models [Maynard et al., 1983;\nWeimer, 1995, 1996] can provide.\n[5] In our present study we map AMIE potentials\nthroughout the simple magnetospheric field model [Dungey,\n1963] obtained by adding a uniform southward field to the\nEarth\u2019s dipole field. Use of this simple magnetic field model\nallows us to map electric potentials analytically, in contrast\n(for example) to Boonsiriseth et al. [2001], who needed to\nmap potentials numerically because they used the more\ncomplicated magnetic field model of Tsyganenko [1996].\nHere we calculate ion and electron drift trajectories and the\nelapsed times required to execute them in several \u2018\u2018frozen-\nin-time\u2019\u2019 realizations of AMIE electric fields obtained dur-\ning several magnetic storms, including three large storms\nselected for detailed study by the NSF Geospace Environ-\nment Modeling (GEM) Inner Magnetosphere Storms Cam-\npaign and the extremely large \u2018\u2018Bastille Day\u2019\u2019 storm of 15\nJuly 2000.\n[6] In other words we allow our representative particles to\nfollow paths of constant kinetic plus potential energy (i.e.,\ncontours of constant Hamiltonian) without allowing the\nelectric field to evolve realistically in time through the\ncourse of the simulation. This study is therefore only a\nprelude to the simulation of actual particle drift paths\nthrough the time-varying AMIE electric field for a real\nstorm. Our purpose here is to learn about the properties of\nsuch contours in order to help us later interpret results of\ntruly time-dependent bounce-averaged guiding-center drift\nsimulations.\n[7] Accordingly, we compare the drift characteristics\n(spatial patterns and times required for their execution)\nobtained from \u2018\u2018frozen-in-time\u2019\u2019 realizations of AMIE elec-\ntric fields with those obtained from corresponding \u2018\u2018frozen-\nin-time\u2019\u2019 realizations of our simple model electric fields\nderived from superimpositions of shielded (Volland-Stern,\ng = 2) and unshielded (Brice-Nishida, g = 1) potential\nfunctions. These comparisons help us anticipate the impli-\ncations of a more realistic electric-field model for the\nparticle drifts that lead to formation of the stormtime ring\ncurrent.\n2. Mapping AMIE Potentials in Analytical\nMagnetic Field Models\n[8] Although commonly displayed as plots, AMIE poten-\ntials are in fact based on an analytical expansion in terms of\ncolatitude and magnetic local time f in the ionosphere, so\nthat\n\u0001AMIE q;f; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nX\ni\nai t\u00f0 \u00de\u0001i q;f\u00f0 \u00de \u00f01\u00de\nwhere the ai are AMIE expansion coefficients and t denotes\ntime. The basis functions \u0001i are constructed from associated\nLegendre functions with nonintegral index n at high\nlatitudes and a linear combination of trignometric functions\nat low latitudes [Richmond and Kamide, 1988]:\n\u0001i q;f\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc K1i Pjmjn cos q\u00f0 \u00de fm f\u00f0 \u00de q < q0; q > p\u0002 q0\n\u00bc K2i cotm q=2\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe tanm q=2\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \n fm f\u00f0 \u00de q0 < q < p\u0002 q0\n\u00f02\u00de\nfm f\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nffiffiffi\n2\np\ncosmf m < 0\n\u00bc 1 m \u00bc 0\n\u00bc ffiffiffi2p sinmf m < 0:\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhere q0 is the colatitude that is (typically chosen to be\n40\u0002) at which the expansions in equation (2) are forced to\nmatch smoothly, m is the azimuthal wave number, and K1i\nand K2i are normalizing constants that cause the gradients\nof the basis functions to be orthonormal over the\nionosphere and continuous at q = q0. The eigenvalues n\nare determined by matching logarithmic derivatives of the\nhigh- and low-latitude basis functions at q = q0. AMIE\nSMP 5 - 2 CHEN ET AL.: QUASI-STEADY DRIFT PATHS WITH AMIE\npotentials are not usually calculated equatorward of q = q0\nin practice. The AMIE coefficients ai are determined via\nleast-squares fit of the analytical expansion (1) to magnet-\nometer data and to any available satellite and radar data.\n[9] AMIE potentials can be mapped analytically to any-\nwhere in a magnetic field model in which the field-line label\nL can be expressed explicitly in terms of the colatitude q.\nFor this study we use such a magnetic field model, namely\nthat which results from superposition of a dipolar magnetic\nfield and a uniform southward\u0002B parallel to the dipole axis\n[Dungey, 1963]. The resulting field is specified by\nB r; q\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc mEr 1=r2\n\u0003 \u0004\ncos q\u0002 r=b3\u0003 \u0004 cos q\u0005 \u0006 \u00f04\u00de\nwhere r is the geocentric distance and b is the radius of the\nequatorial neutral line. The strength of\u0002B is chosen here so\nthat the circular boundary between closed and open field\nlines intersects the Earth at colatitude q* = 20\u0002. In this case\nthe uniform southward \u0002B has an intensity of 14.7 nT and\nleads to b = 12.82 RE. The equation of a field line in this\nmodel is\nr \u00bc La 1 \u00fe 1=2\u00f0 \u00de r=b\u00f0 \u00de3\nh i\nsin2 q; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere a is the Earth\u2019s radius and L is the dimensionless\nmagnetic-shell label inversely proportional to the amount of\nmagnetic flux enclosed. The label of the last closed field\nline is thus L* = 2b\/3a, so that L* = 8.5466 for q* = 20\u0002.\nAccording to equation (5), the relationship between L and q\nat altitude r \u0002 a = 110 km is thus\nL \u00bc 1:017= sin2 q; \u00f06\u00de\nand this relationship allows AMIE potentials to be\nexpressed as \u0001AMIE(L, f, t), a function of L, f, and t.\n[10] This simple magnetic field model preserves essential\nfeatures of the relevant physical processes, while still letting\nus simplify the derivation of the particle kinematics in the\nmodel. For this study we have kept \u0002B and thus the radius\nof the neutral line constant during the storm. In future\nstudies we plan to change \u0002B with time so that the size\nof our model magnetosphere varies more realistically. A\ntime-varying magnetic field would lead to induced electric\nfields that we do not explicitly consider in the present study.\nIn the future we also plan to include day-night asymmetry in\nthe magnetic field model.\n3. Hamiltonian Function\n[11] In the present study we consider only equatorially\nmirroring particles that conserve their first two invariants M\nand J (=0) as they drift within the model magnetosphere.\nAdiabatic drift paths are thus contours of constant M for the\nHamiltonian function\nH L;f; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 2MB0m0c2 \u00fe m20c4\n\u0003 \u00041=2\u0002 m0c2 \u00fe q \u0002V\u0003=L\u00bd\n\u00fe\u0001E L;f; t\u00f0 \u00de\n; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere B0 is the equatorial magnetic field value (a function\nof L), q is the particle charge, V\u0003 ( = 90 kV) is the corotation\npotential at L = 1, and \u0001E is the electrostatic convection\npotential function. In the past we have considered a simple\nconvection potential function\n\u0001simple \u00bc \u0002V\u0003\nL\n\u00fe V0\n2\nL\nL*\n\t \n2\nsinf\u00fe\u0002V t\u00f0 \u00de\n2\nL\nL*\n\t \n\nsinf \u00f08\u00de\nincluding a time-independent shielded (g = 2) term with\nV0 = 25 kV and an unshielded (g = 1) time-dependent term\nfrom which the storm-associated electric field enhance-\nment was derived. Hereafter in this paper we will refer to\nthis as the \u2018\u2018simplified\u2019\u2019 electric field model, for compar-\nison with results obtained by using the AMIE potential\n\u0001AMIE given by equation (1) in the Hamiltonian function\nspecified by equation (7).\n[12] In the present study we use the AMIE coefficients\nobtained for selected times during several magnetic storms\nas if these coefficients were time-independent, and so we\ncalculate particle drift paths from the Hamiltonian specified\nby (7) as if the AMIE electric field were time-independent.\nMoreover, we compare these quasi-steady AMIE drift paths\nwith drift paths obtained from corresponding time-inde-\npendent realizations of the simplified convection electric\npotential given by equation (8).\n4. Equipotentials\n[13] As we have mentioned, AMIE convection electric\nfields are usually illustrated by plotting their equipotential\ncontours on a spherical surface at altitude 110 km in the\nionosphere. Since we are interested here in magnetospheric\neffects of AMIE electric fields, we illustrate their spatial\ncharacteristics by mapping ionospheric AMIE potentials to\nthe equatorial plane. We do this at various representative\ntimes during the four magnetic storms of interest: those of\n19 October 1998 (minimum Dst = \u0002112 nT), 25 Septem-\nber 1998 (minimum Dst = \u0002207 nT), 15 May 1997\n(minimum Dst = \u0002115 nT), and 15 July 2000 (minimum\nDst = \u0002300 nT). The first three of these storms were those\nselected for detailed analysis by the NSF GEM Inner\nMagnetosphere Storms Campaign. The fourth is the\nfamous \u2018\u2018Bastille Day\u2019\u2019 storm, so named for the date of\nthe corresponding coronal mass ejection. AMIE potentials\nwere obtained for these storms by using DMSP drift meter\nand magnetometer data. The transitional colatitude q0 was\ntaken to be at 40\u0002 in the AMIE runs for these storms.\nHowever, DMSP drift meter data for the 19 October 1998\nstorm indicate significant penetration of the stormtime\nelectric field to roughly 50\u0002 latitude [Anderson et al.,\n2001].\n[14] Equipotential surfaces of the combined (convection\nplus corotation) potential function correspond to drift shells\nof particles with zero kinetic energy. We therefore include\nthe corotation potential in computing all the equipotential\npatterns plotted in this paper. Figure 1 shows equipotential\ncontours of the combined potential function (corotation plus\nAMIE convection) in the equatorial plane of our model\nmagnetic field at selected times (prestorm, main phase, and\nrecovery phase) associated with the 19 October 1998 storm.\nThe dotted circle at b = 12.82 RE corresponds to the neutral\nline and thus to the boundary of our model. The dashed\ncircle at 2.47 RE maps to 50\u0002 latitude at altitude 110 km in\nCHEN ET AL.: QUASI-STEADY DRIFT PATHS WITH AMIE SMP 5 - 3\nour magnetic field model. The equipotentials are smooth\nacross the transitional latitude 90\u0002\u0002 q0. However, one needs\nto be cautious about interpreting AMIE potentials below the\ntransitional latitude, since data coverage is typically sparse\nthere. The equipotential contours (black curves) in Figure 1\ncan be regarded as contours of constant Hamiltonian (or\ntotal energy, kinetic plus potential) per unit charge (in units\nof keV) for particles with first adiabatic invariant M = 0.\nThe plus signs on these contours mark drift-time intervals\nof equal length as cold plasma would drift from the neutral\nline along the direction of flow shown by the arrows if the\ncorresponding electric field were frozen in time. We mark\n60-minute intervals for the prestorm and recovery phase\nexamples (Figures 1a and 1d) but 10-min intervals for the\nmain phase examples (Figures 1b and 1c), in which the\nconvection electric field is much stronger. Figure 1 shows\nthat the AMIE equipotentials are not symmetric between\nday and night. In fact there is no identifiable line of\nsymmetry in Figure 1. The lowest L value on the last open\nequipotential tends to be reached in the evening quadrant.\nMoreover, open equipotentials connecting the night side to\nthe morning side in Figure 1 are skewed in a manner similar\nto what McIlwain [1974] found when he constructed a\nmagnetospheric electric field model based on geosynchro-\nnous particle injection boundaries observed by the ATS-5\nsatellite during substorms. Finally, the locations of x-type\nFigure 1. Patterns of equatorial AMIE plus cororation equipotentials are shown for representative times\nduring (a) prestorm (0100 UT), (b) early main phase (0800 UT), (c) recovery phase (1500 UT), and (d)\nrecovery phase (2300 UT) of the 19 October 1998 storm. The black curves are contours of constant\nHamiltonian in units of keV per charge. The plus signs mark drift time intervals. The dashed curve at\n2.54 RE maps to the AMIE transitional latitude of 50\u0002 in our magnetic field model.\nSMP 5 - 4 CHEN ET AL.: QUASI-STEADY DRIFT PATHS WITH AMIE\nstagnation points (i.e., their values of L and MLT) in the\nquasi-static cold plasma flow patterns illustrated in Figure 1\nvary with time.\n[15] For comparison with the AMIE-based equipotential\npatterns shown in Figure 1, each panel in Figure 2 shows\nequatorial equipotential contours of the combined potential\nfunction (corotation plus convection) based on the \u2018\u2018sim-\nplified\u2019\u2019 convection electric field model defined by equation\n(8). For fairness we require the simplified model to impose\nthe same total potential drop across the polar cap as the\nAMIE potential function provides at the corresponding time\nfor each panel in Figure 1. For example, since AMIE\nimposed a total cross polar cap potential drop of 29.2 kV\nat 0100 UT on 19 October 1998 (Figure 1a), we assigned\n25 kV to the Volland-Stern (g = 2) term and 4.2 kV to the\nBrice-Nishida (g = 1) term in equation (8) so as to generate\nthe equipotential contours plotted in Figure 2a. Unlike\nAMIE-based patterns, equipotential patterns derived from\nthe simplified model are symmetric about the dawn-dusk\nmeridian. The lowest L value on the last open equipotential\ncontour occurs at dawn in each panel of Figure 2, and the\nx-type stagnation point for cold plasma flow in the sim-\nplified model always occurs at dusk.\n[16] The Stern-Volland (g = 2) term in equation (8)\ngenerates an equatorial electric field of strength jr\u0001simplej\n= 0 at r = 0, of strength jr\u0001simplej = (V0\/2b)jcos fj \r\n0.153jcos fj mV\/m at the neutral line (r = b), and of\nmaximum strength jr\u0001simplej \r 0.88(V0\/b) \r 0.27 mV\/m\nat r \r 0.54b \r 6.93 RE, f = \u00b1p\/2 (i.e., on the dawn-dusk\nmeridian). The Brice-Nishida (g = 1) term in equation (8)\ngenerates an equatorial electric field of strength jr\u0001simplej =\n(1\/2b)jcos fj\u0002V(t) at the neutral line (r = b) and of\nFigure 2.

These\nlast two expressions amount to 0.612jcos fj mV\/m and\n0.918 mV\/m, respectively, if (for example) \u0002V(t) = 100 kV.\n(The equatorial electric field for g = 1 is not strictly uniform\nin Dungey\u2019s model magnetosphere, but the maximum in\njr\u0001simplej at r = 0 broadly spans the quasi-dipolar region.)\nAlthough r\u0001simple remains algebraically simple even if\nboth terms (g = 2 and g = 1) are included together in\nequation (8), it is more cumbersome to locate maxima in\njr\u0001simplej in this case. However, it stands to reason that\nmaxima in jr\u0001simplej with both terms present would exceed\n(and be located somewhere between) maxima in jr\u0001simplej\nwith either term neglected.

There is day-night symmetry in |E|\nFigure 3.

The green dashed curve at 2.54 RE maps to the AMIE transitional latitude of\n50\u0002 in our magnetic field model.\nFigure 4. Patterns of equatorial AMIE plus cororation equipotentials are shown for (a) 1100 UT of the\n15 May 1997 storm and (b) 0530 UT of the 25 September 1998 storm. These two times correspond to the\nstorm main phases.\nSMP 5 - 6 CHEN ET AL.: QUASI-STEADY DRIFT PATHS WITH AMIE\nin the simplified model. For this particular example, the\nmaximum jEj (=1.5 mV\/m) is attained at 3.5 RE at dusk and\nat dawn.\n[17] During storm main phases, the equatorially mapped\nAMIE convection electric field tends to have a much\nstronger (and more narrowly confined) interior maximum\nin jr\u0001Ej than the simplified model has. This feature is\nconsistent with radar [Yeh et al., 1991] and satellite [Row-\nland and Wygant, 1998; Anderson et al., 2001] observa-\ntions. Indeed, the region of strongest AMIE electric field is\noften concentrated in a particular sector of MLT. During the\nearly main phase (0800 UT) of the 19 October 1998 storm\n(see Figure 1b and Figure 3b) the electric field was strongest\nin the evening sector. Figure 3b shows the equatorial AMIE\nelectric field intensity jEj in the Earth\u2019s corotating frame for\n0800 UT on 19 October 1998. The AMIE electric field is\nquite strong on the dusk side at L \u0001 3\u20137, as well as in the\nevening sector at L ^ 4. The maximum jE| ( = 6.1 mV\/m) is\nattained on the duskside at L = 5.3. Wygant et al. [1998]\nshowed from CRRES observations that the electric field can\nreach values of 6 mV\/m between L = 2 and L = 5 on the\ndusk side during the main phase of very intense storms.\nThus the AMIE electric field intensity during the main\nphase of the 19 October 1998 storm is consistent with the\nfindings of Wygant et al. [1998]. Figures 4a and 4b show\nexamples of AMIE equipotentials in the equatorial plane\nduring the main phases of the 15 May 1997 and 25\nSeptember 1998 storms, respectively. The AMIE electric\nfield was stronger in the morning quadrant than elsewhere at\n1100 UT during the main phase of the 15 May 1997 storm\n(see Figure 5a). The AMIE electric field was strong at low L\nvalues (L < 4) from premidnight to postdawn at 0530 UT\nduring the main phase of the 25 September 1998 storm (see\nFigure 5b). For all three storms the equipotentials were\nskewed so that particles transported closest to Earth would\nhave come primarily from the duskside of the plasma sheet.\nA concentration of electrostatic field on the nightside is\nconsistent with what is found in self-consistent calculations\nof electrostatic and induced electric fields in the Rice\nConvection Model (RCM). Fok et al. [2001] reported that\nthe electric field was strongest in the evening quadrant at\nlow L values during an RCM simulation of the 2 May 1986\nstorm event. We note though that the AMIE electric field is\npurely electrostatic and the RCM electric field includes an\ninduced electric field.\n[18] To illustrate further the variability of equatorial\nAMIE equipotential patterns, we locate the x-type stagna-\ntion point associated with the separatrix between open and\nclosed equipotentials at 5-min intervals during the 3 GEM\nstorms. Stagnation points for general M are identified by\nfinding where the gradient of the Hamiltonian H given by\nequation (7) is zero: @H\/@r = (1\/r)(@H\/@f) = 0. This part of\nthe procedure is easily automated. Here we treat the case\nM = 0. However, as there may be several stagnation points\neven for M = 0, we distinguish between x-type and o-type\nstagnation points by examining the equipotential contour\nthrough each stagnation point. When there is more than one\nx-type stagnation point, we choose the one with the lowest\nL value on a drift separatrix that resembles an open-closed\nequipotential boundary.\n[19] The top two panels of Figure 6 show the equatorial\nradial distance R0 (in units of Earth radii) to, and the MLTof,\neach thus chosen x-type stagnation point during the 18\u201321\nOctober 1998 storm. The cross symbols correspond to AMIE\nx-type stagnation points, while the filled circles correspond\nto the x-type stagnation points in the simplified electric field\nmodel with the same (as AMIE) total cross polar cap\npotential drop (shown in the third panel of Figure 6). The\nequatorial radial distance to the x-type stagnation point in the\nsimplified model tends to track that found in the AMIE\nFigure 5.

This is not surprising, since the same total cross\npolar cap potential drop deduced from AMIE was also used\nin the simplified model. MLT values of AMIE stagnation\npoints are quite variable, however, whereas MLT values of\nstagnation points in the simplified model are fixed at 1800\n(dusk).\n[20] To relate the locations of x-type stagnation points to\nphases of the storm, we show the Dst trace in the fourth\nFigure 7.

During the storm main\nphase, when the z-component of the interplanetary magnetic\nfield was negative and relatively steady, the x-type stagna-\ntion point was located mainly in the afternoon quadrant (see\nFigure 6, second panel). The longitude of the x-type stag-\nnation point during the main phases of the 15 May 1997\nstorm (see Figure 7) and of the 25 September 1998 storm\n(see Figure 8) also occurred predominantly in the afternoon\nquadrant. This seems to be a typical feature of AMIE\nequipotentials.\n5. Ion and Electron Quasi-Drift Paths\n[21] When mapped to the equatorial plane, the stormtime\nAMIE convection electric field tends to be concentrated\n(especially during main phase) in a rather narrow sector\n(\u000160\u0002 wide) of nightside MLT and tends to reach a\npronounced maximum at L \u0001 2\u00025 within that sector.\n(The MLT location on which the favored sector is centered\ncan be quite variable.) These tendencies remain noticeable\nin Figures 3a and 5. In this section we compare the effects\nof AMIE and simplified electric field models on the drift\nmotions of particles with M = 0, 3, 10, and 30 MeV\/G,\nwhich correspond to ion kinetic energies E = 0, 33, 110, and\n330 keV at r0 = 3 RE. Our results are shown below in figure\npanels labeled (a)\u0002(d), respectively. Values of M = 3 and\n10 MeV\/G largely span the range of representative ring-\ncurrent energies, whereas M = 30 MeV\/G seems more\nrepresentative of an ionic radiation belt. Here the drift paths\nare calculated under both the time-independent AMIE\nFigure 9.

As we have said, the\npurpose of the present study is to set the stage for realistic\nsimulations with time-dependent electric fields by gaining\nan appreciation for the characteristics of quasi-steady state\ndrift paths for M \u000e 0, calculated as if the electric fields were\nfrozen in time.\n5.1. Quasi-Drifts During Large Storm of\n19 October 1998\n[22] We calculate the quasi-steady state drift paths of\nequatorially mirroring (i.e., with second invariant J = 0)\nsingly charged ions with constant first invariant M, using\nthe Hamiltonian given by equation (7). Figure 9 shows\nrepresentative results obtained by using the AMIE electric\nfield model for 0800 UT (early main phase) during the 19\nOctober 1998 storm. For ions with M = 3, 10, and 30\nMeV\/G (Figures 7b, 7c, and 7d) the x-type stagnation\npoint in the drift at 0800 UT (early main phase) on 19\nOctober 1998 occurs within a few hours of midnight. Ions\nwith lower M values can penetrate deeper into the mag-\nnetosphere on the dusk side than ions with higher M\nvalues, for which azimuthal B \u000f rB drifts compete more\neffectively with radial and azimuthal E \u000f B drifts in\ndetermining the trajectories. Because of the strong electric\nfield in the evening sector at this time, there was rapid\ntransport (requiring only \u000120\u000230 min) of ions with M\nvalues representative of the ring current from the neutral\nFigure 10. Equatorial quasi-drift paths of singly charged ions withM = (a) 0, (b) 3MeV\/G, (c) 10MeV\/G,\nand (d) 30 MeV\/G in our simplified electric field model for a cross polar cap potential drop of 175.5 kV,\nsame total AMIE cross polar cap potential drop at 0800 UT on 19 October 1998.\nSMP 5 - 12 CHEN ET AL.: QUASI-STEADY DRIFT PATHS WITH AMIE\nline to L \u0001 2\u20135 near dusk, where the partial ring current\ntypically resides. Mid-latitude magnetometer data [Clauer\net al., 2003] confirm that such an asymmetric ring current\nformed about 20 min after a strongly southward Bz\noccurred on 19 October 1998. Thus, an AMIE-based\nelectric field model can account for the observed rapid\ndevelopment of an asymmetric ring current during the 19\nOctober 1998 storm.\n[23] For comparison with the AMIE ion drift paths shown\nin Figure 9, drift paths of ions with M = 0, 3, 10, and\n30 MeV\/G in the simplified electric field model (with the\nsame total potential drop of 175.5 kV across the polar cap)\nare shown in Figure 10. The x-type stagnation points in the\ndrift of ions withM = 3, 10, and 30 MeV\/G occur at dawn in\nthe simplified model. The drift time of 3 MeV\/G ions from\nthe neutral line to L \u0001 4 at dusk (where the partial ring\ncurrent forms) in the simplified model requires about\n1.5 hours, which is significantly longer than in the AMIE\nelectric field model (\u000120 min.), as well as significantly\nlonger than the formation time of the partial ring current as\nobserved by Clauer et al. [2003]. The drift times can be\ninferred from Figures 9 and 10 by counting the plus signs\nthat mark 10-min intervals.\n[24] Kistler and Larson [2000] calculated quasi-steady\ndrift paths of ions using the IMF-dependent Weimer [1996]\nelectric field. They considered Bz = \u000210 nT, a solar wind\nspeed of 445 km\/s and no dipole tilt as parameters for the\nWeimer [1996] model. These conditions are different than\nthose of the 19 October 1998 storm (see IMF data in\nFigure 6) in which Bz \u0001 \u000220 nT during the storm main\nphase. One of their examples of drift trajectories for\n3 MeV\/G ions (10 keV at 4.5 RE for 08:00 MLT; see left\npanel of second row of Figure 5a of Kistler and Larson\n[2000]) shows a stagnation point in the ion drift at \u00014 RE\nFigure 11. Equatorial quasi-drift paths of electrons with M = (a) 0, (b) 3 MeV\/G, (c) 10 MeV\/G, and (d)\n30 MeV\/G in snapshot of AMIE electric field model for 0800 UT on 19 October 1998.\nCHEN ET AL.: QUASI-STEADY DRIFT PATHS WITH AMIE SMP 5 - 13\naround 2000 MLT. This is near the AMIE stagnation point\nof ions (\r4 RE at 2245 MLT) for 0800 UT on 19 October\n1998. Thus the ion stagnation points in the Weimer [1996]\nand AMIE models are not too far apart even for somewhat\ndifferent IMF conditions.\n[25] We have also calculated quasi-drift trajectories of\nequatorially mirroring (J = 0) electrons from the Hamiltonian\nfunction specified by equation (7). Figure 11 shows quasi-\ndrift paths of electrons with M = 0, 3, 10, and 30 MeV\/G in\nthe quasi-steady AMIE electric field model for 0800 UT\n(early main phase) during the 19 October 1998 storm. The x-\ntype stagnation points in the drift of electrons withM = 3, 10,\nand 30 MeV\/G are located within 3 hours MLT of dusk. As\nwe found for ions with M values corresponding to ring\ncurrent energies, electrons withM = 3 and 10 MeV\/G would\nhave had rapid access (requiring only \u000120 min) from the\nneutral line toward L values where the partial ring current\nformed near dusk. However, unlike ions of similar M, a\nsignificant fraction of electrons are diverted toward morning\nin this field model.\n[26] For comparison with the AMIE-based electron tra-\njectories in Figure 11, quasi-drift paths of electrons with\nM = 0, 3, 10, and 30 MeV\/G in the simplified electric field\nmodel are shown in Figure 12. The x-type stagnation points\nin these electron drift patterns occur at dusk. Moreover,\nelectrons with M = 3, 10, and 30 MeV\/G tend to not\npenetrate as deeply in L on the evening side in the quasi-\nsteady simplified model as they do in the quasi-steady\nAMIE electric field model for this time during the storm.\n[27] Thus far we have shown some examples of particle\nquasi-drift trajectories to illustrate important differences\nbetween drift characteristics in the AMIE and simplified\nFigure 12. Equatorial quasi-drift paths of electrons withM = (a) 0, (b) 3 MeV\/G, (c) 10 MeV\/G, and (d)\n30 MeV\/G for a cross polar cap potential drop of 175.5 kV, same as total AMIE cross polar cap potential\ndrop at 0800 UT on 19 October 1998.\nSMP 5 - 14 CHEN ET AL.: QUASI-STEADY DRIFT PATHS WITH AMIE\nelectric field models during the early main phase of a large\nstorm. Particle quasi-drift patterns in fact vary (along with\nthe AMIE model field) throughout a storm. To illustrate this\nvariability we show in Figure 13 the locations of x-type\nstagnation points in the drift of equatorially mirroring ions\nand electrons with representative values of M during the\nprestorm, main, and recovery phases of the 19 October\n1998 storm. Red, green, and blue cross symbols corre-\nspond to the AMIE stagnation points for ions with M\nvalues of 0, 5, and 10 MeV\/G, respectively. Figure 13a\nshows the MLT of the x-type stagnation points of singly-\ncharged ions during 18\u201321 October 1998. The locations\nof stagnation points for zero-energy (M = 0) ions or\nelectrons were already presented in Figure 6 and discussed\nin the section on equipotentials; the results are shown\nagain here for comparison with M = 5 and 10 MeV\/G.\nThe AMIE x-type stagnation points of ions with 5 and\n10 MeV\/G occurred mostly between evening and dawn\n(\u00012100 to 0600 MLT) during the entire time period shown.\nDuring the main phase of the storm (0400 UT-1700 UT) on\n19 October 1998, they occurred mostly within 3 hours of\nmidnight. In contrast the x-type stagnation points of ions\nwith M = 5 and 10 MeV\/G in the simplified electric field\nmodel always occur at dawn. Figure 13b shows the equa-\ntorial radial distance R0 to the x-type stagnation points for\nions in the AMIE field model. At any given time, the\ndistance to the x-type stagnation point tends to be larger\nfor ions with a larger first invariant.\n[28] Figure 13c shows the MLTs of x-type stagnation\npoints for electrons with the same three M values during\n18\u201321 October 1998. The x-type stagnation points of\nelectrons with M = 5 and 10 MeV\/G occur mainly between\ndawn and evening (0600 to 2100 MLT) during the entire\ntime period. During the main phase of the storm, the x-type\nstagnation points of electrons with M = 5 and 10 MeV\/G\noccur predominantly in the afternoon quadrant. The electron\nx-type stagnation point in the simplified model always\noccurs at dusk (dashed black line).\n[29] The most rapid transport of particles occurs where\nthe electric field is strongest. Although we do not show\nexamples of ion drift paths for the two other GEM storms,\nwe find rapid transport of ions with 3 MeV\/G from the\nnightside neutral line to L \u0001 5 to the morning (\u000140 min. to\nL \u0001 5 at 0300 MLT) during the main phase (1100 UT) of\nthe 15 May 1997 storm. The most negative Dst of that\nstorm is attained near 1100 UT. At that time the AMIE\nelectric field is strongest in the morning sector at L \u0001 4\u20136\nas can be seen in either Figure 4a or Figure 5a. It requires\nabout 1 hour for ions with 3 MeV\/G to be transported to\nL \u0001 4 at \u00012100 MLT from the nightside neutral line during\nthe main phase (0530 UT) of the 25 September 1998 storm.\nThe 0530 UT time is near the most negative Dst of that\nstorm. The corresponding AMIE electric field is strongest at\nL \u0001 3\u20134 from the evening to beyond dawn (see Figures 4b\nand 5b). We find that the AMIE electric field tends to be\nstrongest in some sector on the nightside. This concen-\nFigure 13.

Quasi-Drifts During the Extremely Large\n\u2018\u2018Bastille Day\u2019\u2019 Storm of 15\u201316 July 2000\n[31] Ions with M values representative of the ring current\npopulation had rapid access from the plasma sheet to the\ndusk side at L \u0001 3\u20134 in the AMIE electric field model\nduring early main phase of the large 19 October 1998 storm.\n[32] Next we investigate the particle drifts in the AMIE\nelectric field model during the extremely large 15\u000216 July\n2000 \u2018\u2018Bastille Day\u2019\u2019 storm, in which a minimum Dst of\n\u0002300 nT was attained. For the main phase of the Bastille\nDay storm we have needed to extend the AMIE model to\nlower latitudes than usual so as to account for the detection\nof large electric fields even at L = 1.5 through DMSP\nsatellite measurements of very large westward ion drifts as\nlow as 35\u0002 latitude in the ionosphere at about the time when\nDst reached its most negative value (P. C. Anderson, private\ncommunication, 2001). In order to accommodate these low-\nlatitude DMSP measurements (along with the usual mag-\nnetometer data) in our special AMIE run for the Bastille\nDay storm, we changed the AMIE transitional colatitude q0\nin equation (2) from the usual 40\u0002 to 50\u0002.\n[33] Figure 5c shows the equatorial AMIE electric field\nintensity in the Earth\u2019s corotating frame for 2100 UT for the\n15 July 2000 storm. The time of 2100 UT was during the\nFigure 14.

The\ndashed curve at 1.74 RE maps to the AMIE transitional latitude 40\u0002 in our magnetic field model.\nSMP 5 - 16 CHEN ET AL.: QUASI-STEADY DRIFT PATHS WITH AMIE\nmain phase of that storm. Very large electric field intensities\n(\u00015 mV\/m) occur as low as L \u0001 2 near pre-midnight. The\nAMIE electric field intensity is as large as \u000111 mV\/m at\nL \u0001 4 at predusk.\n[34] Figure 14 shows equatorial quasi-drift paths for ions\nwith M = 0, 3, 10, and 30 MeV\/G at 2100 UT on 15 July\n2000. The dashed circle at 1.74 RE maps to 40\u0002 ionospheric\nlatitude (q0 = 50\u0002) in our magnetic field model. Values of\nM \u0001 1\u201315 MeV\/G are representative of ring current ions.\nIons with M = 3 MeV\/G have access to as low as L \u0001 2 on\nthe dusk side (see Figure 14b) after about 1.5 hour drift time\nfrom the nightside neutral line. Ions with somewhat higher\nM value (10 MeV\/G) have access to as low as L \u0001 3 in the\nevening quadrant (see Figure 14c) after drift times \u00011 hour.\nThis very deep penetration of ring current ions is consistent\nwith the very strong ring current that was observed during\nthis storm. The total AMIE cross polar cap potential was\n166 kV at 2100 UT on 15 July 2000. In the simplified\nelectric field model with the same 166-kV potential drop\nacross the polar cap, ions with M = 3 MeV\/G have access to\nas low as L \u0001 2\u20132.25 near dusk. However, the correspond-\ning drift times (\u00012\u20133 hours) to such low L values are\nsignificantly longer than in the AMIE electric field model.\nIons with M = 10 MeV\/G do not reach L \u0001 3 in the\nsimplified electric field model, and they require drift times\n\u00011.5 hours even to reach L \u0001 3.5.\n[35] Equatorial quasi-drift paths for electrons with M = 0,\n3, 10, and 30 MeV\/G at 2100 UT on 15 July 2000 are\nshown in Figure 15. Like the ions with M values repre-\nsentative of the ring current, electrons with M = 3 and\n10 MeV\/G have access to low L values at this time. For a\ngiven M value, however, electrons do not have access to as\nlow an L value as ions. Electrons with M = 3 MeV\/G reach\nonly L \u0001 3 (see Figure 15b), whereas ions with M = 3\nFigure 15. Equatorial quasi-drift paths of electrons withM = (a) 0, (b) 3 MeV\/G, (c) 10 MeV\/G, and (d)\n30 MeV\/G in snapshot of AMIE electric field model for 2100 UT on 15 July 2000.\nCHEN ET AL.: QUASI-STEADY DRIFT PATHS WITH AMIE SMP 5 - 17\nMeV\/G have access to L \u0001 2 (see Figure 14b). Electrons\nwith M = 10 MeV\/G reach only L \u0001 3.5 (see Figure 15c),\nwhereas ions with M = 10 MeV\/G have access to L \u0001 2.5\n(see Figure 14c). The drift patterns in Figure 15 also shows\nthat electrons from the evening quadrant of the neutral line\ntend to be diverted past midnight toward the morning\nquadrant, whereas corresponding ions in Figure 14 tend\nto drift past dusk toward the afternoon quadrant.\n6. Summary and Conclusions\n[36] In this study we have examined inner magneto-\nspheric particle drift characteristics as inferred from quasi-\nsteady realizations of the AMIE electric field in a simple\nmagnetospheric model during four storms. We have chosen\nto use the AMIE electric field because it includes some\nimportant stormtime convection features that have recently\nbeen recognized but which have not been included in our\nprevious stormtime simulations. Here we have compared\nAMIE quasi-drift characteristics with those obtained from\nthe simple semi-empirical model of convection that we have\nused in previous stormtime simulations. Since stormtime\nAMIE equipotential patterns are highly variable in time and\ncomplicated in spatial structure, the corresponding quasi-\ndrift trajectories are similarly complicated. In contrast, the\npatterns of equatorial drift trajectories in the simplified\nmodel are (by construction) symmetric about the dawn-dusk\nmeridian and mutually similar in shape. AMIE equipotential\npatterns do, however, show recurrent features that consis-\ntently modify particle drift trajectories relative to the sim-\nplified model, and these features are important for\nunderstanding formation of the stormtime ring current. In\nparticular, during storm main phase the AMIE electric\nequipotentials tend to be concentrated in a limited MLT\nsector on the nightside. This concentration leads to rapid\ninward transport of ions with first invariant values repre-\nsentative of the ring current population from the nightside\nneutral line to low L values (\u00013\u20134) near dusk where the\npartial ring current forms. For example, the transport time\nfrom r0 = 12.8 RE to r0 = 3 RE for ions with first invariant\nM = 3 (corresponding to kinetic energy E = 33 keVat r0 = 3\nRE) or 10 MeV\/G (110 keV at r0 = 3 RE) is on the order of\n20 min. Such an access time is consistent with observations\n[e.g., Clauer et al., 2003] of rapid formation of an asym-\nmetric ring current within half an hour after storm onset.\nLosses due to charge exchange should be negligible on this\ntime scale. Indeed, Liemohn et al. [2001] have found that\nion outflow of ions along open drift paths to the dayside\nmagnetopause is the main loss mechanism for the ring\ncurrent\u2019s contribution to Dst during the early recovery\nphase. The same loss process should have been present\nalso during the main phase, when it would have been\nbalanced by access of new ions from the nightside neutral\nline.\n[37] We have investigated particle drifts in the AMIE\nelectric field during the extremely large \u2018\u2018Bastille Day\u2019\u2019\nstorm of 15 July 2000, when large stormtime penetration\nelectric fields were observed by DSMP satellites (P. C.\nAnderson, private communication, 2001) to reach to as low\nas 35\u0002 near the time of minimum Dst (= \u0002300 nT). Large\nelectric fields at low latitudes of low L values would have\nlead to a deep penetration of ions with first invariant values\nrepresentative of the ring current population during this\nstorm\u2019s main phase. Ions with first invariant M = 3 MeV\/G\nwould have reached L \u0001 2 about an hour before the first\nminimum in Dst (= nT) was attained at 2130 UT. This deep\npenetration of ring current ions could account for the very\nstrong ring current that was observed during the \u2018\u2018Bastille\nDay\u2019\u2019 storm.\n[38] In this study we have calculated quasi-steady drift\npaths in selected \u2018\u2018snapshots\u2019\u2019 of the AMIE electric field.\nHowever, time-dependent particle drift equations can be\nderived easily from the Hamiltonian function specified by\nequation (7) as a function of M, L, and j [e.g., Schulz and\nChen, 1995]. We are currently incorporating the AMIE\nelectric field into truly time-dependent simulations of ring\ncurrent formation and decay. It will be interesting to see\nhow the more rapid access of ions to the ring current region\nin consequence of the strength of AMIE electric fields in the\nevening quadrant of the inner magnetosphere affect the\ndevelopment of the asymmetric and symmetric components\nof the ring current and the overall ring current energy\ncontent.\n[39] Acknowledgments.
