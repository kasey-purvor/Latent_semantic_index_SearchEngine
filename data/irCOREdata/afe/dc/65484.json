It is argued that this kind of approach offers \na rather artificial, abstract and narrow conception of ethics. Consideration is \nthen given to what might be the implications for learning and teaching of \nshifting emphasis towards a more embedded conception of ethics in \nprofessional life, with a focus on the commitment and character of \nprofessional practitioners and the specificities of the contexts in which they \nwork. \n \nKey words: professional ethics; social professions; conduct; character \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nLiterature in the field of professional ethics is rapidly growing. This is \nparticularly noticeable in relation to the social professions (social work, social \ncare, social pedagogy, youth and community work) as books and articles in \nthis field been relatively sparse until recently (Banks, 2008). With a growing \nnumber of specialist textbooks and the introduction of two journals (the online \nJournal of Social Work Values and Ethics in 2005 and Ethics and Social \nWelfare in 2007), the first decade of the twenty-first century is heralding some \nnew developments in the field of ethics for the social professions.  \n \nProfessional ethics \n \n\u201eProfessional ethics\u201f as a discipline (an area of study) and as a practice (what \nprofessional practitioners say and do) is constructed through the academic \nand professional literature and the practices of organisations and workers. \nLearning and teaching in the field of professional ethics is heavily influenced \nby textbooks in the specialised subject areas (social work, nursing, medicine, \nfor example) and documents published by professional bodies, particularly \ncodes of ethics or conduct.  In this literature, \u201eprofessional ethics\u201f is often \nequated with codes, rule-following, analysis of difficult cases and the \ndevelopment and use of ethical decision-making models. I will briefly \n 2 \nsummarise what I characterise as the traditional approach to professional \nethics, outlining what I see as three main features.  \n \n1) Codes of ethics \u2013 There is a tendency to associate both the study and \npractice of \u201eprofessional ethics\u201f with ethical codes. Codes of ethics are \nwritten or implicit sets of norms that usually identify the core purpose of the \nprofession and outline ethical principles and rules or standards of \nprofessional practice. They are generally written and controlled by \nprofessional or regulatory bodies and play a role in demarcating the \nprofession, promoting professional identity, guiding and regulating \npractitioners and protecting service users (Banks, 2003). These norms can \nbe characterised as \u201eexternally generated\u201f in that they originate from \noutside the individual professional practitioner. They comprise general \nprinciples and rules that apply impartially to anyone in the profession in \nquestion (see, for example, British Association of Social Workers, 2002; \nNational Association of Social Workers, 1999; National Youth Agency, \n2001). In Britain, and perhaps other countries too, the proliferation of \ncodes of ethics, conduct or practice, particularly exemplified by increasing \nconcern with ethics in public life and ethics in the practice of research (the \nlatter being monitored and enforced by research ethics \ncommittees\/institutional review boards), has contributed to an image of \n\u201eethics\u201f as being about conformity to rules and standards.  \n \n2) Conduct \u2013 Professional ethics tends to focus on the conduct, that is, \nactions, of anyone in the role of professional practitioner.  There is a \nconcern with deciding what ought to be done and judging whether the \nactions taken were right or wrong with reference to impartial general \nethical principles. Codes of ethics tend to encourage us to think in this kind \nof way, as do many of the textbooks, which often make substantial use of \naction-focused cases for illustration or discussion (for example, Banks, \n2006; Beckett & Maynard, 2005; Congress, 1999; Reamer, 1990). \n \n3) Cases - The cases that feature in professional ethics textbooks often take \na particular form. They are abstracted from time and place and give little \nindication of the character, emotions, or specific circumstances of the \nactors involved (Chambers, 1997). This is particularly true of the typical \nshort case used in teaching, where minimal contextual details are given of \na situation or event and students are asked to discuss and decide what the \nprotagonists in the situation should do, or what they, the students, would \ndo in such a case (Banks & Williams, 1999). Often these cases may be \nframed and referred to as \u201edilemmas\u201f (choices between two equally \nunwelcome alternatives) and sometimes students are encouraged to use a \ndecision-making model.  \n \nIn this short article I will simply make come comments about \u201eprofessional \nethics cases\u201f and the decision-making models that are often recommended to \nassist students and practitioners in thinking through difficult cases.   \n \n 3 \nProfessional ethics cases: decision-making \n \nI will take a case that was constructed by a colleague (Imam, 1999) and has \nbeen used in the European Social Ethics Project (with which I am involved) in \nresearch and teaching about ethics with students (Banks & N\u00f8hr, 2003). The \ncase, based on real experiences, was given the title of \u201ecultural conflict\u201f when \nused in teaching with students. \n  \nThe worker in an Asian women's project was approached by a member \nwhose daughter, Asha, attended the young women's group. The \nmother was concerned about her daughter's behaviour as she had \nbeen seen in the community with her white boyfriend. This had \nprovoked great censure within the community as she was seen to be \ntoo 'westernised and moving out of her culture'. As a widowed single \nparent the mother was quite distressed about her daughter's behaviour \nand the implications this would have for her own honour and respect, \nas well as that of her other daughters, within the community. She \nasked the worker to use her influence to dissuade the young woman \nfrom seeing her white boyfriend. Asha had also discussed the issue \nwith the worker and clearly stated that she felt she should have the \nright to make her own decision about her future partner and did not \nreally care what her community thought of her. What should the worker \ndo? \n \nThe case is framed as a choice for the worker \u2013 whether to support the \nmother or daughter. It does not include much detail about any of the \ncharacters involved. The worker may be an Asian woman, but we are not \nsure. We do not know in what country the action takes place, what is meant \nby \u201eAsian\u201f, how well the worker knows the family, how old Asha is or what her \nboyfriend is like, apart from being \u201ewhite\u201f. All these questions are usually \nraised by students in discussion and a common way forward is often identified \nas involving the worker taking a mediating role between the mother and \ndaughter. Cases like this are very useful in teaching.  \n \nHowever, the focus in professional ethics textbooks on difficult cases makes it \nseem as if \u201eethical\u201f issues only arise when a problematic case or difficult \ndilemma is experienced. This is a point make by Rossiter et al (2000) based \non their research with Canadian social workers. They reported that \npractitioners regarded the more contextual and policy related issues in their \nwork (which were not framed as \u201ecases\u201f) as to do with \u201epolitics\u201f and therefore \nnot part of their area of decision-making influence. This focus on cases also \nleads to ignoring ethical dimensions of other aspects of practice, which are \nnot about action and decision-making \u2013 for example, motives, qualities of \ncharacter, or moral perception as a precursor to invoking principles or making \ndecisions. Since typical textbook ethics cases are often rather de-\ncontextualised (no time, place, country) accounts of actions, leading to a need \nto make a decision, inevitably analysis is drawn towards consideration of \nethical decision-making using principle-based approaches to ethics.    \n \n 4 \nTo help students to analyse cases like this, textbooks often offer ethical \ndecision-making models. Loewenberg and Dolgoff (1996), for example, offer a \nhierarchy of ethical principles to aid decision-making in social work. When \nthere is a conflict of principles, then priority is given to the principle that is \nhighest in the list as follows: \n \n1) Protection of life. \n2) Equality and inequality. \n3) Autonomy and freedom. \n4) Least harm. \n5) Quality of life. \n6) Privacy and confidentiality. \n7) Truthfulness and full disclosure. \n \nIn the case of Asha and her mother, we might conclude, on the basis of this \nhierarchy, that respecting Asha\u201fs autonomy should come before \nconsiderations about her mother\u201fs reputational harm or quality of life. \nInterestingly, in reviewing the hierarchy of principles, Harrington and Dolgoff \n(2008) report they have found that social workers vary in how they rank the \nprinciples, suggesting that the idea of a fixed hierarchy does not operate in \npractice. Other approaches to ethical decision-making include linear stepwise \nmodels that serve to guide the student or practitioner in systematically \nanalysing and assessing the issues involved in a case and the possibilities for \naction. For example, Goovaerts (2003) offers a seven-stage plan as follows: \n \n1) What are the facts? \n2) Whose interests are at stake? \n3) What is the dilemma about? \n4) What are the alternatives? \n5) What is the conclusion? \n6) How to carry out the decision? \n7) Evaluation and reflection.  \n \nThere are numerous other models, including Gallagher\u201fs ETHICS framework \noutlined in this journal: Enquire about facts, Think through options, Hear \nviews, Identify principles, Clarify meaning, Select action (Gallagher & Sykes, \n2008).  \n \nRossiter et al (2000) reported that they did not find social workers using \nethical decision-making models in their practice. I think most of us would be \nvery surprised if they had. This is not just because in many cases there is no \ntime for the professional to consult a step-by-step model, but because \n(despite the rhetoric) these models are not designed to be used on a daily \nbasis. They are mainly a way of encouraging students (often in a classroom or \nsupervision setting) to reason and reflect systematically on ethical issues in \npractice, some aspects of which may then become intuitive or \u201esecond nature\u201f \nas they practise social work. Nevertheless, while useful in this sense, these \ndecision-making models are somewhat problematic in that they can imply that \n\u201eethical\u201f issues can be separated out from other aspects of practice (technical, \npolitical, legal and so on), and some of the models suggest the use of a rather \n 5 \nsimplistic rational-deductive model of reasoning involving applying general \nethical principles (perhaps from a code of ethics) to an ethical dilemma or \nproblem, in order to resolve it.    \n \nAll of these criticisms can be countered, and indeed have been. Professional \nethics textbooks are becoming more sophisticated and complex as the years \ngo by, with second, third and fourth editions adding in greater coverage of \nvirtue ethics, the ethics of care, postmodern and discourse approaches. \nSimilarly, new and improved ethical decision-making models are being \ndeveloped. For example, in an article for Ethics and Social Welfare, McAuliffe \nand Chenoweth (2007) outline their \u201eInclusive Model of Ethical Decision-\nMaking\u201f, which is circular in form and takes into account many of the criticisms \nof the existing simplistic, sequential models. Their model rests on four key \nplatforms (accountability, consultation, cultural sensitivity and critical \nreflection), which are constructed from \u201eimportant foundational values and \nprinciples\u201f, and \u201eunderlie the dynamic five-step process that uses a reflective \nyet pragmatic approach to identify and analyse all relevant aspects of an \nethical dilemma\u201f. This model adopts a more sophisticated and flexible \napproach to ethical decision-making and encompasses aspects of sensitivity \nand critical reflection within it. In this sense it acknowledges the embedded \nand contextualised nature of practice. However, it is still located within the \ntraditional model of professional ethics as concerned with resolving ethical \ndifficulties logically and rationally through analysing all aspects of a situation \nin a relatively impartial fashion.  \n \nEthics in professional life \n \nIn order to free ourselves of some of these associations, it might be helpful to \nmake a conscious effort to shift from the concept of \u201eprofessional ethics\u201f as an \narea of study to thinking instead about \u201eethics in professional life\u201f. The use of \nthe phrase \u201ein professional life\u201f draws attention to the idea of \u201eprofessional life\u201f \nas a whole: it is lived by people; it has a past and a future; it may have a \ntexture and a particular context. The suggestion is that \u201eethics\u201f as an area of \nstudy can be found embedded in the life, and ethics as values and norms are \nlived in and through the life. This does not mean abandoning professional \nethics, but it means broadening the scope of focus from codes, conduct and \ncases to include commitment, character and context. It means including more \nrelevant approaches from moral philosophy that stress the situated nature of \nethics, such as virtue ethics, care ethics and moral phenomenology (including \nmoral perception, imagination, empathy). Such approaches are beginning to \nbe advocated for in the literature on ethics in social work, but often at a \nphilosophical and theoretical level, rather than in terms of how this might \ninfluence teaching and learning.  We can also draw on empirical studies by \nsocial work academics and practitioners, which offer accounts from \npractitioners and service users about what they say, think, feel and do in \npractice. These empirical studies are often not linked to the literature on \nprofessional ethics, but can be very useful in offering narrative accounts and \nanalyses of moral discourse and practice. Three elements of ethics in \nprofessional life are identified below.  \n \n 6 \n1) Commitment \u2013This involves paying attention to the internally generated \nvalue commitments of those who take on the roles of professional \npractitioners, that is, seeing them as having commitments to a range of \nvalues, including personal and political, as well as professional and \nsocietal. It entails taking account of people\u201fs motivations for doing the \nwork, including the role of passion and \u201evocation\u201f in people\u201fs professional \nlives.  \n2) Character \u2013 Considering the importance of character or people\u201fs moral \nqualities leads to a focus on the person rather than on their actions or \nconduct. Important questions for consideration include: \u201eHow should I live?\u201f \n\u201eWhat kind of person should I be?\u201f \u201eHow can I be caring, courageous or \njust as a professional practitioner?\u201f   \n3) Context \u2013 This involves acknowledging that practitioners work in particular \ncontexts where politics, policy, the profession and employing agency \ndefine what is relevant. It entails an holistic approach, situating the \npractitioner in webs of relationships and responsibilities, taking into \naccount the importance of moral orientation, perception, imagination and \nemotion work. \n \nEthics in Context: Narratives of Professional Life \n \nAs a contrast to the constructed ethics case, I will now offer an extract from an \ninterview conducted with a female British social worker based in a hospice. \nShe was talking to the interviewer about the importance of appreciating \nservice users\u201f points of view.1  \n \nAs I said to the Macmillan nurse [specialist nurse for cancer care based \nat the hospice] one day as she and I were walking up a man\u201fs path, I \nsaid: \u201eThat man\u201fs looking through his window and he must think: \u201cMy \nlife has come to this, here I am and there\u201fs a social worker and a nurse \ncoming up my path\u201d\u201f. You can\u201ft get much worse than that in life really \nbecause what it says, it says something about that man\u201fs life. It says \non every level he\u201fs having to resort to this support and it\u201fs a long way \nfrom a man who once thought he was independent, a person who was \nin control of his own life. One of them says: \u201eYou\u201fre dying\u201f and the other \none says: \u201eYou\u201fre not coping socially\u201f. And you know, if you look at it in \nterms of how he felt about that, that must have been such a deeply \ndepressing thing for him to see coming up his path, this bevy of people \nwho were saying: \u201eYou need lots of help here on every level\u201f; and for \nsomebody who\u201fs not used to that, extraordinarily undermining. And I \nhave to know that my presence is not always welcomed.  I may think \nthat I\u201fm supporting people but what they see when a social worker \nturns up is something quite different [they think]: \u201eI\u201fve failed\u201f.  \n \nThis is a different kind of story from the cultural conflict case discussed earlier. \nIt is a reflective account given in the words of the social worker. It does not \ninvolve a decision or even an actual difficulty. It is simply a story of how she \n                                                 \n1\n I am grateful to Cynthia Bisman for allowing me to use this interview transcript. More \ndetailed discussion of this extract occurs in Banks and Gallagher (2008). \n 7 \ngoes about her everyday work, in which ethical dimensions are embedded. \nThis social worker seems to be giving the interviewer an account of herself as \na good social worker. She describes herself imagining what the man she is \ngoing to visit might be thinking, and even speaks in his voice. She gives a \nstory about herself as a person who is doing a lot of psychological work, \npreparing herself for her meeting with the man.  She is morally orienting \nherself towards the encounter she will shortly have, drawing on her moral \nimagination, perception and sensitivity. This story would be equally as good \nas the cultural conflict case in providing opportunities for students to talk and \nthink about ethics. Similar accounts given by students themselves of ordinary \naspects of their working lives could also be used in learning and teaching.   \n \nImplications for learning, teaching and study   \n \nQuite a lot has been written at a theoretical or speculative level about the \npotential of situated approaches to ethics (ethics of care, virtue ethics, \nexistential and relational ethics) to contribute to understanding ethics in the \ncontext of the work of social professionals (Clifford, 2002; Gray & Lovat, 2007; \nHugman, 2005; Orme, 2002; Thompson, 2008). Less has been developed, \nhowever, to show how this would work in practice and how such approaches \ncan be incorporated into teaching and learning about ethics.  Some points are \nnoted below and further elaboration from a virtue ethics point of view can be \nfound in Banks and Gallagher (2008). \n \n1) Seeing ethics everywhere \u2013 Rather than separating ethics as a discrete \narea of study and abstracting ethical issues from practice learning, we can \nsee ethics as embedded in practice learning and across the curriculum. \n2) Working with contextualised living stories\/accounts \u2013 In addition to \nworking with short cases framed as dilemmas or involving difficult \ndecisions, students and practitioners can be encouraged to give longer, \nmore personal narrative accounts of their everyday professional lives, \nincluding their feelings, imaginings, hopes and fears.  \n3) Balancing logic (analysis) with passion (feelings, emotions, \nimagination) \u2013 Whilst recognising the importance in professional work of \nbeing able to justify decisions, reason logically and argue coherently, it is \nequally important to develop the capacities of students and practitioners to \nbe morally perceptive, sensitive and compassionate. \n4) Use of role plays, simulation, literature, poetry, drama \u2013 In education \nand training for the social professions the use of role play and other \ncreative methods is well-established, especially in teaching communication \nskills. These approaches are equally valuable in learning and teaching \nabout ethics.  \n5) Focusing on developing the capacities of practitioners to do \u2018ethics \nwork\u2019 \u2013 The idea of \u201eethics work\u201f is a development of Hochschild\u201fs (1983) \nconcept of \u201eemotion work\u201f, which she introduced in relation to her study of \nflight attendants to encapsulate the work that goes into being caring, \nattentive and compassionate in situations where this would not be our \nnatural response. We could characterize as \u201eethics work\u201f the hospice \nsocial worker\u201fs use of her imagination and moral sensitivity. Ethics work \ninvolves emotion work, but has added dimensions of: \n 8 \n \n moral perception or attentiveness to the salient moral features of \nsituations;  \n recognition of the political context of practice and the practitioner\u201fs \nown professional power (reflexivity);  \n the moral struggle to be a good practitioner\u2013 maintaining personal \nand professional integrity while carrying out the requirements of the \nagency role. This would include handling the moral distress that \ncomes from seeing what ought to be done but not being able to do \nit. It involves developing the moral qualities of courage and \nprofessional wisdom. \n \nThese preliminary reflections on the concept of \u201eethics in professional life\u201f are \npart of a developing trend in philosophy to broaden the study of ethics from \nrational, principle-based action to include virtues, relationships and emotions.  \nIt is particularly important to develop such approaches to ethics for the social \nprofessions, as rational, managerialist trends push in the opposite direction. \n \nReferences \n \nBanks, S.
