Firstly, the histories of India and\nPakistan after 1947 have come to be conceived separately, with many\nscholars assuming that the two states developed along divergent paths\nafter independence. Thus, the dominant historical paradigm has been\nto examine either India or Pakistan in relative isolation from one\nanother. While a handful of very recent books on the partition of\nthe subcontinent have begun to study the two states simultaneously,1\nvery few of these new histories reach beyond the immediate concerns\nof partition.2 Of course, both countries developed out of much the\nsame set of historical experiences. Viewing the two states in the same\nframe not only allows the contributors to this issue to explore common\nthemes, it also facilitates an exploration of the powerful continuities\nbetween the pre- and post-independence periods.\nSecondly, the papers that follow pose new questions about the nature\nof the state in early postcolonial South Asia. A small number of recent\nhistorical works concerning India and Pakistan in the immediate\naftermath of independence have begun to bridge the gap between the\nstudy of \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 politics in South Asia by examining low-level\nstate programmes such as refugee rehabilitation and the recovery of\nabducted women.3 However, there has been very little historical work\non the development of popular, public cultures surrounding the state\nin South Asia at this time. This special issue seeks to fill this gap\nby drawing on recent anthropological work on the \u2018everyday state\u2019.4\nThus, whilst remaining sensitive to the ambiguity and complexity\nof the boundaries between state and society, many of its papers\nfocus on the functioning of the state in everyday life where it was\nactually experienced by ordinary people, with contributors exploring\nthe interplay between the rhetorical, ideological platforms set out in\nNew Delhi and Karachi and the interpretations of these agendas in\n1 Tan Tai Yong and Gyanesh Kudaisya, The Aftermath of Partition in South Asia\n(London: Routledge, 2000); Vazira Fazila-Yacoobali Zamindar, The Long Partition and\nthe Making of Modern South Asia: Refugees, Boundaries, Histories (New York: Columbia\nUniversity Press, 2007).\n2 Dipesh Chakrabarty, Rochona Majumdar, and Andrew Sartori, (eds), From the\nColonial to the Postcolonial: India and Pakistan in Transition (New Delhi: Oxford University\nPress, 2007).\n3 For example, Zamindar,The Long Partition, Ritu Menon and Kamla Bhasin,Borders\nand Boundaries: Women in India\u2019s Partition (Delhi: Kali for Women, 1998).\n4 C.

Fuller, and Veronique Benei, (eds), The Everyday State and Society in Modern\nIndia (New Delhi: Social Science Press, 2000); Thomas Blom Hansen, and Finn\nStepputat, (eds), States of Imagination: Ethnographic Explorations of the Postcolonial State\n(Durham: Duke University Press, 2001).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nF R O M S U B J E C T S T O C I T I Z E N S 3\ndifferent localities. This framework significantly augments current\nunderstanding of postcolonial South Asia, without replicating the\nlongstanding divide between histories of \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 politics in\nSouth Asia.\nThis volume diverges from the existing historiographical discussions\nabout the nature of the transition from the colonial to the postcolonial.\nOver the past decade, scholarship on the subject has become ensnared\nin a debate about whether or not 1947 marked a distinct break in the\nhistory of the subcontinent. The process of transition, however, was far\ntoo complex to be encapsulated in the dichotomy change\/no change.\nAs the papers here demonstrate, partition and the integration of the\nprincely states often had a profound effect on the everyday lives of\nmany of the new citizens of India and Pakistan. Moreover these events\nnot only altered the geographical extent of the states of South Asia, but\nalso expanded the states\u2019 responsibilities and opened up opportunities\nfor governments to pursue policies distinct from those of their colonial\npredecessors. At the same time, however, the papers indicate that,\nwhilst the state in South Asia was subject to considerable adjustment\nin the transition to independence, the rhetorical underpinnings of\nthe postcolonial states were often not so novel and, in many cases,\nthe state\u2019s modus operandi did not change during this period. Thus,\ndiscourses originating in development regimes, or the nationalist\nmovements of the first half of the twentieth century, shaped not only\nthe policies of independent governments, but also the demands that\npostcolonial citizens made of them. In addition, the rationing, requis-\nition and recruitment policies introduced during the Second World\nWar stretched state bureaucracies to their widest extent to date, and,\nsimultaneously, revealed new weaknesses and opened up new oppor-\ntunities for corruption that stretched into the postcolonial period.\nUntil very recently it was also common to view the decades between\n1947 and the present (2010) as a single period in the history of South\nAsia. Whilst lines of periodization are always perilous to draw, today\u2019s\nmost cutting-edge scholarship suggests that it does make some sense\nto regard the interval between the 1930s and the 1960s as a distinct\nstage in South Asian history. By the third decade after independence,\nthe major tensions extant in the nation-building projects of both\nIndia and Pakistan could no longer be contained. As these tensions\nerupted, they began to disrupt the ordinary functioning of politics and\nto tear apart existing social bonds. This is not to suggest, however,\nthat the time before 1970 was a golden age: quite the contrary.\nThe propensity to study the first two decades of postcolonial rule\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n4 T A Y L O R C . S H E R M A N , W I L L I A M G O U L D A N D S A R A H A N S A R I\nalongside more recent decades has tended to overstate the coherence\nand stability of the former, especially with respect to India. India\u2019s\nmuch-discussed \u2018crisis of secularism\u20195 in the 1990s elicited many\nrose-tinted evaluations of the Nehruvian state\u2019s secular credentials,\nbut the contributions below by Gould, Newbigin, and Sherman\nhighlight the extent to which this nostalgic view misjudges the early\nyears of independence in India. Indeed, looking at this earlier era\nfrom a historical perspective, it becomes clear that the nature of the\nstate and the content of citizenship were keenly contested at this\ntime. It is in these contests, therefore, that one finds a distinct set of\nissues and themes that characterize this period.\nAmongst these issues, the significance of the performative aspect of\nstate power on the subcontinent is stressed in many of the papers in\nthis volume. Recently researchers have come to highlight the ways in\nwhich both colonial and early postcolonial rule were characterized\nby infrequent but spectacular displays of state power. From the\nuse of exemplary force to maintain \u2018law and order\u2019 in the districts,\nto the drafting of grand schemes designed to awe or inspire the\npopulation, certain projects or actions of the state were imbued\nwith extraordinary meaning and designed to send a message to\nthe population at large. Both postcolonial India and Pakistan used\nceremony to underscore the legitimacy of the state and to chart a\nvision of the nation after independence. Khan shows that Gandhi\u2019s\ndeath rituals, including the distribution of his ashes to disparate\nlocations in India, provided a medium through which the Congress\nparty could try to unite a nation that had been deeply fractured by\nthe experience of partition. In postcolonial Pakistan, as Haines and\nDaechsel demonstrate, large-scale development projects were often\nused to assert (frequently with an eye to impressing international\naudiences) the capacity of the state to shape not only the land and the\nbuilt environment, but to discipline the people inhabiting these spaces.\nThat these projects were essentially spectacular in nature was evident\nin governments\u2019 frequent disregard for the practical consequences\nof such schemes for the population, and the subsequent failure of\nsome of the most prominent of them. Coombs\u2019 work also emphasizes\nthe performative aspect of power as she traces the ways in which\nthe disproportionate influence which British ICS officers often had\nover events in their districts dissipated when it became clear that the\n5 See Anuradha Dingwaney Needham and Rajeshwary Sundar Rajan (eds), The\nCrisis of Secularism in India (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 2007).\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\nF R O M S U B J E C T S T O C I T I Z E N S 5\nBritish were leaving the subcontinent. Without the assurance that\nsuch displays of limited but spectacular power would be backed by the\nkind of favours that only the state could provide, the acts of British\nofficers were unable to stem the violence of partition. This contributed\nto the popular sense that the state \u2018disintegrated\u2019 during partition.\nIndeed, the state has often been \u2018written out\u2019 of personal narratives of\npartition, whether from ICS men or from Punjabi refugees, as shown\nby both Coombs and Talbot.\nPartition\u2019s effect on the state and the extraordinary pressures that\nthe violent displacement of people put upon state resources is the\nsecond prominent theme in this period. The state had an ambiguous\nplace in the years straddling partition: on the one hand, the struggles\nof partition coupled with the promises made by nationalist leaders\nraised expectations to unprecedented heights. Vulnerable refugees\nwere often extremely reliant upon the state, and rehabilitation plans\noften brought populations that had had no previous contact with the\nstate into its orbit. On the other hand, as Ansari\u2019s work reveals,\nthe early postcolonial period was no golden age for many citizens:\ntheir keen expectations that everyday life would improve dramatically\nafter independence often met with bitter disappointment. Members\nof the population frequently voiced their resentment at the failures\nof their new government servants to live up to the expectation\nthat citizens be given fair access to goods and services. Indeed, as\nGould makes clear, access to services was often secured through\nkinship networks rather than through the functioning of impartial\nbureaucratic procedures. And the inadequacies of the state from\npoor planning to deficient implementation opened up opportunities\nfor corruption to flourish. Indeed, as Ansari, Talbot and Gould\nnote, citizens\u2019 often lofty expectations were regularly coupled with\na remarkable willingness on the part of individuals to use their own\nguile to manipulate those services which the state did provide to secure\npersonal advantage. Indeed, the weakness of the postcolonial state in\nboth India and Pakistan emerges as a surprising, but recurrent theme\nin this period. Of course, it is common to lament the ineptitude of\nthe early Pakistani state, especially in comparison with that of India.\nBut these papers reveal that the Indian state, whilst undoubtedly\nendowed with more resources than Pakistan, was often internally\nincoherent and its officers seem to have been perpetually subject to\nundue influence. Furthermore, as Gould and Sherman underline, it\nwas often individual state actors who did most to circumvent state\nstructures for their own ends. This fact, which helps explain the gulf\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 04 May 2012 IP address: 158.143.197.75\n6 T A Y L O R C . S H E R M A N , W I L L I A M G O U L D A N D S A R A H A N S A R I\nbetween official rhetoric and the everyday experience of the state,\nsuggests that historians ought to do more to problematize the very\nnature of the state during this period.\nFinally, these papers demonstrate that conceptions of citizenship\nwere far from settled in this period, even in India where the\nconstitution was drafted and enacted relatively quickly. Although\ncitizenship was defined using the language of abstract rights, the\nsituation was invariably far more complex than this. As they emerged\nout of partition, the religious identities of individuals assumed\nextraordinary importance in the new states of South Asia, not least\nfor the displaced, whose access to privileges often was tied to the way\nin which the state identified them. Whilst partition was important,\nthe ways in which ideas of citizenship were inscribed with religious\nand gender norms often had their origins in the colonial period. The\nfundamental rights written into the Indian constitution, according\nto Newbigin, were demarcated within colonial legal structures which\nensured that these legal conceptions of citizenship were mediated by\nreligious and gender norms. As a result, the rights contained in the\nIndian constitution were often most compatible with the interests of\nHindu men. Citizenship was not only shaped at the constitutional level,\nquotidian conceptions of belonging were equally important. Local level\nunderstandings of who was worthy of citizenship were often coloured\nby the intense social polarisation which accompanied the partition of\nthe subcontinent. In partition\u2019s long wake, the loyalty of Muslims in\nIndia remained suspect long after the violence had subsided. According\nto Gould\u2019s research, an individual\u2019s Muslim identity could add force\nto allegations of corruption. Likewise, Sherman reveals the ways in\nwhich Muslims of non-Indian origin residing in Hyderabad (Deccan)\nwere rendered suspect in the aftermath of the invasion of Hyderabad\nin 1948: many were deported or encouraged to leave not because their\nlegal rights had changed, but because informal notions of belonging\nwould have them excluded from India after 1947.\nClearly, the first two decades following independence witnessed an\nintense contest over the meaning and responsibilities of citizenship,\nand over the purpose and scope of the postcolonial state. By viewing\nIndia and Pakistan in the same frame, and examining the state in\nits interactions with the population at the everyday level, this special\nissue offers a fresh look at the field of early postcolonial history.\n"}
