Introduction and Tectonic Setting\n[2] This paper summarizes active slip rates, total strain\nand the timing of collision-related deformation from west-\nern Turkey to eastern Iran, based on GPS data, seismicity,\nand geologic data for total fault displacements and the\ntiming of the onset of deformation. It shows that if present\nday slip rates are extrapolated for 3\u20137 million years they\naccount for the total shortening or strike-slip offset on many\nactive fault systems of the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone.\nWe examine the implications of this result, given that initial\ncollision took place as long ago as the early Miocene (\u000116\u2013\n23 Ma) [Robertson, 2000], in particular how plate conver-\ngence might have occurred in different regions over this\ntime. This is relevant to the long-term evolution of conti-\nnental collisions in general. It is also relevant to the idea that\nthe Arabia-Eurasia collision underwent a reorganization at\nabout 5 Ma, previously suggested for this time because of\nthe initiation or acceleration of strain in fold and fault\nsystems, rapid exhumation of mountain belts and rapid\nsubsidence in adjacent basins [Wells, 1969; Westaway,\n1994; Axen et al., 2001]. We examine possible explanations\nfor this reorganization, which include: opening of the Red\nSea; buoyant Arabian plate lithosphere \u2018\u2018choking\u2019\u2019 the\nsubduction zone; buoyancy forces arising from thickened\ncrust making it easier to shorten adjacent areas or transport\ncrust laterally out of the collision zone.\n[3] In the rest of the paper each part of the Arabia-Eurasia\ncollision is described separately, moving roughly northward\nfrom the Arabian side of the collision into Eurasia. For each\narea we summarize the active slip rates, finite deformation\nand timing of initial deformation (Table 1). In the rest of this\nsection we summarize current knowledge about these\nparameters for the collision zone as a whole.\n[4] The present margins of the collision zone are well\ndefined, picked out by cutoffs in topography and seismicity\n[Jackson and McKenzie, 1988] (Figures 1 and 2). Abrupt\ntopographic fronts at the Persian Gulf and along the\nnorthern side of the Greater Caucasus and the Kopet Dagh\ndefine the southern and northern margins of major active\ndeformation. The eastern boundary is formed by a series of\nnorth-south right-lateral faults in eastern Iran, which allow\ncentral Iran to move northward with respect to Afghanistan\nTECTONICS, VOL. 23, TC2008, doi:10.1029\/2003TC001530, 2004\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0278-7407\/04\/2003TC001530$12.00\nTC2008 1 of 16\nT\na\nb\nle\n1\n.\nD\nef\no\nrm\nat\nio\nn\nR\nat\nes\nW\nit\nh\nin\nth\ne\nA\nra\nb\nia\n-E\nu\nra\nsi\na\nC\no\nll\nis\nio\nn\nZ\no\nn\nea\nD\nea\nd\nS\nea\nF\nau\nlt\nS\ny\nst\nem\nN\no\nrt\nh\nA\nn\nat\no\nli\nan\nF\nau\nlt\nE\nas\nt\nA\nn\nat\no\nli\nan\nF\nau\nlt\nT\nu\nrk\nis\nh\n-\nIr\nan\nia\nn\nP\nla\nte\nau\nG\nre\nat\ner\nC\nau\nca\nsu\ns\nL\nes\nse\nr\nC\nau\nca\nsu\ns\nA\nlb\no\nrz\nA\nlb\no\nrz\n:\nM\no\nsh\na\nF\nau\nlt\nT\nal\nes\nh\nK\no\np\net\nD\nag\nh\nS\no\nu\nth\nC\nas\np\nia\nn\nZ\nag\nro\ns\nS\nim\np\nle\nF\no\nld\ned\nZ\no\nn\ne\nE\nas\nte\nrn\nIr\nan\nA\nct\niv\ne\nd\nef\no\nrm\nat\nio\nn\nra\nte\n,\nm\nm\ny\nr\u0002\n1\n2\n\u2013\n8\nl-\nl\nsl\nip\n2\n4\n\u00b1\n1\nr-\nl\nsl\nip\n9\n\u00b1\n1\nl-\nl\nsl\nip\n<\n2\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n6\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n4\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n-\nat\nn\no\nrt\nh\ner\nn\nsi\nd\ne?\n9\n?\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n?\nl-\nl\nsl\nip\n?s\nh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n\u00031\n6\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n5\n?\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n1\n0\n(N\nN\nE\n-S\nS\nW\n)\nco\nn\nv\ner\ng\nen\nce\n\u00031\n6\nr-\nl\nsl\nip\nC\nu\nm\nu\nla\nti\nv\ne\nd\nef\no\nrm\nat\nio\nn\n,\nk\nm\n1\n0\n5\nl-\nl\nsl\nip\n8\n0\n\u2013\n8\n5\nr-\nl\nsl\nip\n2\n7\n\u2013\n3\n3\nl-\nl\nsl\nip\n\u00032\n0\n0\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n\u00041\n3\n0\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n?\n3\n0\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n3\n0\n\u2013\n3\n5\nl-\nl\nsl\nip\n3\n0\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n7\n5\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n1\n5\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n5\n0\n(N\nE\n-S\nW\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n)\n8\n0\nr-\nl\nsl\nip\nP\nli\no\nce\nn\ne-\nQ\nu\nat\ner\nn\nar\ny\nd\nef\no\nrm\nat\nio\nn\n,\nk\nm\n\u00034\n0\n8\n0\n\u2013\n8\n5\n2\n7\n\u2013\n3\n3\nli\ntt\nle\nth\nic\nk\nen\nin\ng\n?\n?\n\u00033\n0\n\u00033\n0\n\u2013\n3\n5\n\u00033\n0\n7\n5\n1\n5\n5\n0\n?\n(N\nE\n-S\nW\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n)\n?\nS\nta\nrt\no\nf\nd\nef\no\nrm\nat\nio\nn\n,\nM\na\n\u00032\n0\n5\n3\n\u00041\n2\n>\n2\n5\n>\n7\n\u00012\n5\n?\n\u00045\n\u00011\n0\n\u00045\n3\n\u2013\n5\n\u00015\n?\nE\nv\nid\nen\nce\nfo\nr\nre\no\nrg\nan\niz\nat\nio\nn\nsi\nn\nce\nla\nte\nM\nio\nce\nn\ne\nn\no\nt\ncl\nea\nr\nfo\ncu\nse\nd\nd\nef\no\nrm\nat\nio\nn\nst\nar\nt\no\nf\nfa\nu\nlt\nin\ng\nn\no\nt\ncl\nea\nr\nin\ncr\nea\nse\nin\ner\no\nsi\no\nn\nan\nd\nex\nh\nu\nm\nat\nio\nn\nra\nte\ns;\nm\nag\nm\nat\nis\nm\np\nen\nep\nla\nn\nat\nio\nn\n;\nm\nag\nm\nat\nis\nm\ng\nra\nn\nit\no\nid\nex\nh\nu\nm\nat\nio\nn\n;\nre\nv\ner\nsa\nl\no\nf\nst\nri\nk\ne-\nsl\nip\n;\nm\nag\nm\nat\nis\nm\nn\no\nn\ne\nn\no\nt\ncl\nea\nr\no\nn\nse\nt\no\nf\nsh\no\nrt\nen\nin\ng\n?\no\nn\nse\nt\no\nf\nse\nd\nim\nen\nt\nfo\nld\nin\ng\n;\nra\np\nid\nsu\nb\nsi\nd\nen\nce\nsy\nn\n-f\no\nld\nse\nd\nim\nen\nta\nti\no\nn\nn\no\nn\ne\nE\nx\ntr\nap\no\nla\nti\no\nn\no\nf\nac\nti\nv\ne\nd\nef\no\nrm\nat\nio\nn\no\nv\ner\n5\nm\nil\nli\no\nn\ny\nea\nrs\n,\nk\nm\n1\n0\n\u2013\n4\n0\n1\n2\n0\n4\n5\n<\n1\n0\n3\n0\n2\n0\n4\n5\n?\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u00038\n0\n2\n5\n5\n0\n\u00038\n0\na\nD\ner\niv\ned\nfr\no\nm\nso\nu\nrc\nes\nd\nes\ncr\nib\ned\nin\nth\ne\nte\nx\nt.\nH\ner\ne\nl-\nl\nis\nle\nft\n-l\nat\ner\nal\n;\nr-\nl,\nri\ng\nh\nt-\nla\nte\nra\nl.\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n2 of 16\nTC2008\n(Figure 2). In the west, rapid extension in the Aegean occurs\nabove the Hellenic subduction zone. Shortening and crustal\nthickening within the collision zone has produced mountain\nbelts, principally the Greater Caucasus, Zagros, Alborz,\nKopet Dagh and the Turkish-Iranian plateau (Figures 1\nand 2). Strike-slip faulting is also prominent. The portion\nof Turkey between the North and East Anatolian faults is\ntransported westward as these bounding faults slip with\nright- and left-lateral motion respectively [McKenzie, 1972].\n[5] Active deformation rates in the Arabia-Eurasia colli-\nsion zone are becoming better constrained through a com-\nbination of plate circuit and GPS studies [DeMets et al.,\n1990, 1994; Reilinger et al., 1997; McClusky et al., 2000;\nSella et al., 2002; Tatar et al., 2002]. A recent GPS-based\nglobal plate motion model [Sella et al., 2002] gives lower\nestimates of the Arabia-Eurasia convergence rate than\nearlier, non-GPS models [DeMets et al., 1990, 1994],\ntypically by \u000112 mm yr\u00021. The GPS-derived velocity for\nthe northern margin of the Arabian plate is 18 \u00b1 2 mm yr\u00021\nrelative to Eurasia at longitude 48\u0001E [McClusky et al.,\n2000]. The convergence rate increases eastward because\nthe Arabia-Eurasia Euler pole lies in the Mediterranean\nregion, and is roughly 10 mm yr\u00021 higher in eastern Iran\nthan in the west (Figure 1).\n[6] Estimates for the age of the initial collision between\nArabia and Eurasia vary markedly, from \u000165 Ma\n[Berberian and King, 1981], using the end of ophiolite\nobduction, to \u00015 Ma [Philip et al., 1989], taking the onset\nof coarse clastic sedimentation around parts of the Greater\nCaucasus. Neither of these approaches provides a date for\nthe first time continental crust came into contact from the\nconverging plates. Deformation and syn-tectonic sedimen-\ntation took place on the northern side of the Arabian plate in\nthe early Miocene (\u000116\u201323 Ma) [Robertson, 2000], related\nto the overthrusting of allochthonous nappes originating on\nthe Eurasian side of Neo-Tethys. Other studies in the same\nregion put the initial collision-related deformation as Oli-\ngocene [Y\u0001lmaz, 1993], or middle Eocene (\u000140 Ma)\n[Hempton, 1987]. Therefore 16\u201323 Ma is likely to be the\nminimum age range for initial plate collision. Suturing may\nhave been diachronous from the Arabian promontory in the\nnorth, southeast along the Zagros [Stoneley, 1981]. Since\ninitial collision along the Bitlis-Zagros suture, the Arabian\nplate has moved \u0001300\u2013500 km northward with respect to\nFigure 1.

The Zagros mark the present southern\nside to the broad collision zone, and the region\u2019s seismicity\nshows that it absorbs an important part of the overall\nconvergence. The High Zagros lies between the original\nsuture and the High Zagros Fault. This region is the most\nexhumed part of the Zagros, and in the northwest contains\nhighly imbricated Arabian margin strata. Folds become\nmore open to the southeast, indicating that the structure\n(and finite shortening?) of the High Zagros is not the same\nalong strike [National Iranian Oil Company, 1975, 1977a].\nSouthwest of the High Zagros Fault, the Arabian margin\nstrata are less imbricated at exposed levels, less exhumed,\nand form the classic whaleback anticlines of the Simple\nFolded Zone [Falcon, 1974].\n[8] North-south convergence across the northwest Zagros\nis achieved through a combination of northeast-southwest\nshortening and right-lateral strike-slip faulting on the Main\nRecent Fault [Talebian and Jackson, 2002], which lies\napproximately along the suture trace (Figures 1 and 4).\nThere are no other major, northwest-southeast, seismically\nactive strike-slip faults within this part of the Simple Fold\nZone that could help partition the overall convergence in\nthis way. Further southeast, there is a zone of north-south\ntrending right-lateral faults within the central Zagros. In the\neastern part of the range the trend of folds and faults is\ncloser to east-west. These roughly east-west structures\naccommodate the overall convergence without requiring a\ncontinuation of the Main Recent Fault, which dies out at\n\u000151\u0001E.\n[9] A GPS survey in the central Zagros indicates an\nactive convergence rate in a NNE-SSW direction of\n10 mm yr\u00021 across the central part of the Simple Folded\nZone at longitude 52\u0001E [Tatar et al., 2002]. A similar\namount of convergence (\u000110 mm yr\u00021) must be taken up\nelsewhere in Iran, as the overall Arabia-Eurasia conver-\ngence at this longitude is \u000120 mm yr\u00021 [Sella et al., 2002].\nTatar et al. [2002] found little evidence for active shorten-\ning within the High Zagros in this study, although their\nstudy had only three GPS stations in this region. This\nfinding is consistent with the scarcity of seismic thrust\nevents in the High Zagros [Talebian and Jackson, 2004].\n[10] Falcon [1974] estimated the total shortening in the\nSimple Folded Zone as \u000130 km, but this is based on the\nassumption that Phanerozoic strata are concentrically folded\nabove mobile salt, without significant shortening by thrust\nfaulting. More recent work highlights the presence of\nseismically active basement thrusts [e.g., Maggi et al.,\n2000] and recognizes thin-skinned thrusts within the de-\nformed sediments [Colman-Sadd, 1978]. Right-lateral offset\nalong the Zagros Main Recent Fault is about 50 km, based\nFigure 2.

Focal mechanisms in gray in the Caspian Sea are for\nearthquakes deeper than 30 km and are taken from Jackson et al. [2002]. Epicenters are from the\ncatalogue of Engdahl et al. [1998]. Earthquakes deeper than 30 km associated with the subduction zones\nin the Makran and Hellenic Trench have been omitted.\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n4 of 16\nTC2008\non a restoration of offset drainage and geological markers\nalong the fault from roughly 36\u0001N 46\u0001E to 32\u0001N 51\u0001E\n[Talebian and Jackson, 2002]. This implies \u000150 km north-\neast-southwest shortening across the Zagros mountains to\nthe southwest of the Main Recent Fault, and a total north-\nsouth convergence of \u000170 km. A balanced and restored\ncross-section through the northwest Simple Folded Zone,\nbetween \u000132\u0001N 48.5\u0001E and \u000133\u0001N 50\u0001E suggests total\nnortheast-southwest shortening is roughly 50 km [Blanc et\nal., 2003], consistent with the estimate derived from the\noffset of the Main Recent Fault. McQuarrie [2004] pro-\nduced balanced and restored cross-sections that include both\nthe Simple Folded Zone and the High Zagros, and estimated\n70 \u00b1 20 km northeast-southwest shortening.\n[11] Fold growth in the Simple Folded Zone of the\nZagros was synchronous with deposition of Bakhtyari\nFormation conglomerates. These rocks are not well-dated,\nand were described as intra Pliocene by James and Wynd\n[1965] on the basis that there were no diagnostic fossils\nwithin the unit, but Pliocene fauna in the underlying Agha\nJari Formation. These authors also stressed that the unit was\nlikely to be diachronous. Initial fold development in many\nFigure 3. Plate reconstructions for the convergence of Africa-Arabia and Eurasia.

[1989] by extending the continental\nmargin to include Arabia, and allowing for \u0001100 km relative motion between Arabia and Africa post\n20 Ma. There has been roughly 300\u2013500 km of Arabia-Eurasia convergence since initial collision at 20\u2013\n30 Ma. This is comparable with the convergence recognized within the collision zone.\nFigure 4. Cross section through the collision zone. Location shown on Figure 1. Geology derived from\nNational Iranian Oil Company [1978]; Alavi [1994]; Allen et al. [2003a]; Blanc et al. [2003].\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n5 of 16\nTC2008\nareas appears to pre-date the Bakhtyari Formation, given the\nangular unconformity between the Bakhtyari Formation and\nunderlying strata [e.g., O\u2019B Perry and Setudehnia, 1966].\nDeformation in the High Zagros may also have begun\nbefore the Pliocene, because upper Miocene \u2013 lower\nPliocene terrestrial clastics within the Simple Folded Zone\nthicken toward to the northeast and were derived from the\nsame direction [Elmore and Farrand, 1981]. Little is known\nabout the finite shortening or age of deformation within the\nHigh Zagros.\n[12] The 10 mm yr\u00021 rate of active NNE-SSW conver-\ngence in the central Zagros Simple Folded Zone [Tatar et\nal., 2002] would take \u00017 million years to achieve the\n\u000170 km of finite north-south convergence in the northwest\nZagros Simple Folded Zone [Talebian and Jackson, 2002;\nBlanc et al., 2003], although we note that this comparison is\nbetween different slightly azimuths. There is an assumption\nin this extrapolation that it is valid to use GPS-derived slip\nrates in comparison with long-term deformation patterns.\nThere is no a priori evidence for this, but it is a useful\nstarting point for such a large region, and similar compar-\nisons are made at the end of following sections for other\nareas of the collision.\n3. Dead Sea Fault System\n[13] The Dead Sea Fault System (Figure 1) is important\nbecause it is the Arabia-Africa plate boundary and so\nrecords the motion between these plates. It consists of\nleft-lateral fault segments that connect the active oceanic\nspreading centers in the Red Sea to the compressional\ndeformation zones in southeast Anatolia and the Zagros\n[Garfunkel, 1981]. It has a total length of \u00011000 km, and\nincludes several pull-apart basins and push-up zones,\nformed in regions of overlap between left-stepping and\nright-stepping fault segments respectively. The most well\nknown of the pull-aparts is the Dead Sea Basin [Manspeizer,\n1985].\n[14] GPSdata [McClusky et al., 2003] indicate\u00016mmyr\u00021\nof relative Arabia\/Africa motion in the northern Arabian\nplatform. The local GPS survey of Pe\u2019eri et al. [2002] gives\na lower value for Dead Sea Fault slip: 2.6 \u00b1 1.1 mm yr\u00021.\nThere is also a range in the estimates for Pliocene-Quaternary\nrates based on the offset of dated features. Offset late\nPleistocene fans give a slip rate 4 \u00b1 2 mm yr\u00021 for the sector\nbetween the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba [Klinger et al.,\n2000]. Ginat et al. [1998] estimated 3\u20137.5 mm yr\u00021 from\ndisplaced Pliocene-Quaternary alluvial terraces in Wadi\nAqaba, at the northern end of the Gulf of Aqaba. Niemi\net al. [2001] estimated 4.7 \u00b1 1.3 mm yr\u00021 since 15 Ka,\nfrom offset stream channels and fan surfaces south of the\nDead Sea.\n[15] The total offset of the Dead Sea Fault System, south\nof the Dead Sea, is \u0001105 km [Quennell, 1958]. A dolerite\ndyke swarm dated at 22\u201318 Ma shows the full 105 km\noffset, and so constrains the maximum age of initial faulting\n[Eyal et al., 1981]. Quennell [1958] and Manspeizer [1985]\nsuggested two phase movement, with \u000140 km of offset in\nthe Pliocene-Quaternary, or entirely in the Quaternary,\nbased on the Pliocene-Quaternary age of sediments in the\nDead Sea, but this is equivocal [e.g., Sneh, 1996].\n[16] Summarizing these results, there is a wide range of\nestimates for the present left-lateral slip rate on the Dead\nSea Fault System: \u00012\u20138 mm yr\u00021. There is too much\nspread in the data to compare short-term and long-term slip\nrates in detail. It would take \u000113 million years to achieve\nthe full 105 km offset if long-term motion took place at the\ntop end of the range of active slip rates.\n4. Turkish-Iranian Plateau\n[17] The Turkish-Iranian plateau is one of the two main\nplateaux in the Alpine-Himalayan collision system, the other\nbeing Tibet [S\u00b8engo\u00a8r and Kidd, 1979; Dewey et al., 1986]. It\nextends from eastern Anatolia to eastern Iran, and typically\nhas elevations of \u00011.5\u20132 km, decreasing to about 500 m in\neastern Iran. Roughly half of the present collision zone lies\nwithin the plateau, much of which is internally drained.\n[18] The basement of the plateau consists of microconti-\nnents accreted to each other and Eurasia by the Late\nCretaceous or early Tertiary [S\u00b8engo\u00a8r, 1990], interspersed\nwith zones of ophiolites and me\u00b4langes. The microcontinents\ninclude the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone, parallel to and northeast\nof the later Zagros suture, and the Lut block in eastern Iran\n(Figure 1). The Mesozoic and Tertiary sedimentary cover of\nthe Lut block is less deformed than surrounding areas.\nVolcanics of late Cretaceous \u2013 early Miocene age in the\nSanandaj-Sirjan zone and central Iran represent Andean-\ntype magmatism in southern Eurasia during Neo-Tethyan\nsubduction [Berberian et al., 1982]. Volcanic and turbidite\nsuccessions up to 5 km thick represent Eocene back-arc\nextension across central Iran, the Alborz, the Lesser Cau-\ncasus and eastern Black Sea regions, north of the Neo-\nTethyan subduction zone, and prior to Arabia-Eurasia\ncollision [Brunet et al., 2003]. This succession is commonly\noverlain in central Iran by terrestrial clastics, evaporites and\nvolcanics of the Lower Red Formation, of Oligocene age\n[Sto\u00a8cklin, 1971]. Marine deposition resumed across much of\ncentral Iran with the carbonates of the largely lower Mio-\ncene Qom Formation; similar lower Miocene marine strata\nwere deposited across much of Anatolia and the Lesser\nCaucasus [S\u00b8engo\u00a8r et al., 1985; Toloczyki et al., 1994]. The\nQom Formation pinched out in the north against the\nsouthern side of the Alborz and in the south along a line\nparallel to and \u0001100 km northeast of the Zagros suture\n[Sto\u00a8cklin, 1971] \u2013 indicating sub-aerial relief both north and\nsouth of the marine basin. The end of marine sedimentation\nmay have been diachronous: the Qom Formation is overlain\nby middle Miocene terrestrial clastics of the Upper Red\nFormation, but the youngest marine strata in eastern Ana-\ntolia are late middle Miocene, \u000112 Ma [Dewey et al., 1986].\n[19] Seismicity [Jackson et al., 1995]; (Figure 2) and\nGPS [McClusky et al., 2000] data show that there is little\nactive crustal shortening over most of the plateau (Figures 1\nand 2), although \u00014 mm yr\u00021 of shortening may take place\nacross the Lesser Caucasus, at the northern side [Reilinger\net al., 1997; McClusky et al., 2000]. There are prominent\nstrike-slip faults, especially in eastern Anatolia and north-\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n6 of 16\nTC2008\nwest Iran (Figure 2) [Talebian and Jackson, 2002], but when\nthese structures are considered in the overall velocity field\nthey do not indicate eastward transport of the plateau out of\nthe collision zone [Jackson et al., 1995], in contrast to the\nwell-documented westward transport between the North and\nEast Anatolian faults. The Turkish-Iranian plateau is there-\nfore important for understanding how strain has been ac-\ncommodated over the long-term, but takes up little of the\npresent Arabia-Eurasia convergence by shortening or lateral\ntransport of crust eastward out of the convergent zone.\n[20] There are few estimates for the total late Cenozoic\nshortening across the plateau. Pearce et al. [1990] sug-\ngested it could be as much as 200 km, based on estimates\nthat the crust was \u000130 km thick before shortening and\n\u000150 km thick at present. Miocene strata are commonly\nfolded and thrusted [e.g., National Iranian Oil Company,\n1977b]. In many places these folded strata lie below\nundeformed volcanics mapped as upper Miocene to Qua-\nternary in age, such as the extreme northwestern tip of Iran\nat 39.25\u0001N 44.75\u0001E, around Maku [Geological Survey of\nIran, 1975], and southeast of the city of Tabriz at 37.25\u0001N\n47\u0001E [Geological Survey of Iran, 1978]. An intra-Pliocene\nregional unconformity within the Lesser Caucasus separates\nyounger, flat-lying strata and alkali volcanics from folded\nmiddle and upper Miocene calc-alkali volcanics and asso-\nciated sediments; strike-slip faults cut dykes, thrusts and\nfolds as young as 7 Ma [Koc\u00b8yigit et al., 2001]. There are\nalso cases where post middle Miocene volcanics are\nrecorded as folded or faulted (such as at \u000137.4\u0001N 47.3\u0001E\n[National Iranian Oil Company, 1977b]), but there are\nfewer examples of this pattern.\n[21] There are few well-constrained estimates of present\ncrustal thickness, based on receiver function analysis. A\nstudy of the Lesser Caucasus in Armenia indicates the crust\nin that area is 64 \u00b1 4.8 km thick [Sandvol et al., 1998].\nThicknesses are lower to the southwest, in eastern Anatolia,\nat 40\u201350 km [Zor et al., 2003], but still greater than normal\nfor continental crust. There are also studies that estimate\ncrustal thickness through other means, such as seismic\nrefraction surveys and gravity modelling. Snyder and\nBarazangi [1986] found that the crust thickens from\n\u000140 km at the Persian Gulf to \u000165 km at the Zagros\nsuture, while a recent review of the Middle East found that\nmost of the Turkish-Iranian plateau is underlain by crust\n45\u201350 km thick [Seber et al., 2001]. Therefore the Turkish-\nIranian plateau has thicker than average continental crust,\nconsistent with the evidence for post late middle Miocene\ncrustal shortening, but the exact amount of shortening and\noverall crustal thickness are not well-constrained.\n[22] Surface uplift of the plateau has been suggested to be\na regional event [S\u00b8engo\u00a8r and Kidd, 1979], rather than a\nprogressive process associated with a migrating deformation\nfront. This is based on the apparent uniformity of timing and\nelevations attained by an erosion surface, proposed as late\nMiocene \u2013 early Pliocene in age [S\u00b8engo\u00a8r and Kidd, 1979],\nbut not well-dated.\n[23] In summary, the Turkish-Iranian plateau was short-\nened, thickened and elevated since \u000112 Ma at the latest,\nduring or prior to regional magmatism. This has produced\ncrust locally up to \u000164 km thick [Sandvol et al., 1998], in a\nregion where there are Miocene marine strata [Toloczyki et\nal., 1994]. There is little evidence for active regional\nshortening and crustal thickening in the seismicity or GPS\ndata. It is not known precisely when crustal thickening\nended, and whether there was a gradual or sudden switch to\nshortening in the active fold and thrust belts north and south\nof the plateau.\n5. Eastern Iran\n[24] The eastern limit of Arabia-Eurasia deformation\noccurs at roughly longitude 61\u0001E, close to the political\nborder between Iran and Afghanistan. Further east there is a\nsharp cut-off in seismicity, mountainous topography and\nactive fault activity (Figures 1 and 2).\n[25] The 10 mm yr\u00021 convergence in the central Zagros\n[Tatar et al., 2002] is likely to be a minimum value for the\neastern Zagros, given that the width of the range and the total\nArabia-Eurasia convergence rate increase eastward. There-\nfore, using anArabia-Eurasia convergence rate of 26mmyr\u00021\nat longitude \u000160\u0001E [Sella et al., 2002], a maximum of\n\u000116 mm yr\u00021 remains to be accommodated between central\nIran and stable Eurasia. This must result in a comparable\namount of right-lateral shear on north-south strike-slip faults\nalong the eastern margin of Iran (Figure 5). North of latitude\n34\u0001N, this right-lateral shear is accommodated by east-west\nleft-lateral faults that rotate clockwise about vertical axes\n(Figure 5a) [e.g., Jackson and McKenzie, 1984].\n[26] The maximum of 16 mm yr\u00021 of right-lateral shear is\ndivided between the Gowk-Nayband and Sistan Suture\nZone fault systems that occur along the western and eastern\nmargins of the Dasht-e-Lut respectively (Figure 5a). These\nsystems each contain several parallel fault strands. However,\nlittle is known of the slip-rates across these faults, and hence\nthe present-day distribution of strain.\n[27] Walker and Jackson [2002] used drainage systems\nand structural features displaced by the Gowk fault to\nestimate a total cumulative offset of \u000112 km. The Gowk\nfault is the only active strike-slip fault west of the Dasht-e-\nLut at that latitude (Figure 5a), and so the majority of right-\nlateral shear west of the Dasht-e-Lut is expected to be\nlocalized across it. Displacement of distinctive bed-rock\nlithologies by active faults in the Sistan Suture Zone indicate\na minimum of\u000170 km of cumulative right-lateral slip east of\nthe Dasht-e-Lut, based in part on initial observations by\nFreund [1970], and Tirrul et al. [1983] (Figure 5b).\n[28] A minimum of \u000180 km of right-lateral shear be-\ntween central Iran and Afghanistan is required by summing\nthese estimates of cumulative fault slip. This would take\n\u00015 million years to achieve at the likely 16 mm yr\u00021\nmaximum rate of active right-lateral shear. More work is\nneeded to constrain directly both the active slip rates and\ntime of initial deformation.\n6. East and North Anatolian Faults\n[29] Westward transport of the Anatolian (Turkish) plate\noccurs by slip on the East and North Anatolian faults\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n7 of 16\nTC2008\n[McKenzie, 1972]. The quality of the data on the history and\npresent slip rates of these faults provides important con-\nstraints on both the short-term and long-term deformation\npatterns in this part of the collision.\n[30] The left-lateral East Anatolian Fault accommodates\nmotion between the Arabian and Anatolian plates (Figure 1).\nIt trends for \u0001400 km southwest of its intersection with the\nNorth Anatolian Fault at Karliova, at approximately 39.5\u0001N\n41\u0001E. There are several strands to the fault zone, with\nlocalized pull-apart basins and push-up zones [Lyberis et\nal., 1992; Westaway, 1994].\n[31] Historical slip rates based on seismic moments of\nearthquakes along the East Anatolian Fault are 6\u2013\n10 mm yr\u00021 [Taymaz et al., 1991]. The GPS-derived slip\nrate is 9 \u00b1 1 mm yr\u00021 [McClusky et al., 2000]. There is\nconsiderable variation in published estimates of the overall\noffset. The higher end of the range is 27\u201333 km [Westaway\nand Arger, 1996], constrained by offset geological markers,\nand by the length of the Golbasi strike-slip basin (\u000133 km).\nOther values in the order of 15\u201322 km [Hempton, 1985;\nDewey et al., 1986] may underestimate the total because\nthey are based on offset drainage or geological features on\nindividual fault segments [Westaway and Arger, 1996].\n[32] Initial movement on the East Anatolian Fault is late\nPliocene (\u00013 Ma) or younger [S\u00b8aroglu et al., 1992;\nWestaway and Arger, 2001], based on the offset of volcanics\nFigure 5. (a) Detailed fault map of eastern Iran. Active right-lateral strike-slip faults accommodate\nshear between central Iran and Afghanistan. The box shows the location of Figure 5b. (b) Landsat TM\nimage of part of the Sistan Suture Zone. Three right-lateral strike-slip faults, with a combined bed-rock\ndisplacement of \u000170 km are seen at latitude 30.7\u0001N.\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n8 of 16\nTC2008\nof this age. This refines earlier estimates that the fault began\nat \u00015 Ma, based on the estimated Pliocene age of sediments\nin related basins [S\u00b8engo\u00a8r et al., 1985] and the assumption\nthat the East and North Anatolian Faults began their motion\nat the same time [Dewey et al., 1986]. Several other, perhaps\ninactive, left-lateral faults have been identified in eastern\nTurkey, with slip on the order of tens of kilometers. These\ninclude the Malatya-Ovacik Fault [Westaway and Arger,\n2001], with \u000129 km offset between 5 and 3 Ma, and the\nEcemis\u00b8 Fault [Jaffey and Robertson, 2001], with \u000160 km\noffset since the late Eocene, but mainly pre-Pliocene.\n[33] The estimates for the slip rate, finite offset and\ntiming of the East Anatolian Fault are in good agreement:\n9 \u00b1 1 mm yr\u00021 for 3 million years suggests 24\u201330 km of\nfinite offset, compared with the 27\u201333 km of offset esti-\nmated from the geology.\n[34] The right-lateral North Anatolian Fault accommo-\ndates slip between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates over a\nlength of >1200 km (Figures 1 and 2). Its eastern limit lies\nat the Karliova triple junction. The fault splits into several\nstrands where it enters the north Aegean. The GPS-derived\nslip rate for the North Anatolian Fault is 24 \u00b1 1 mm yr\u00021\n[McClusky et al., 2000].\n[35] Displacement in the western part of the North\nAnatolian Fault (Saros Gulf) has been constrained by offset\nfolds as \u000185 km since \u00015 Ma [Armijo et al., 1999]\n(however, see Yalt\u0001rak et al. [2000]). This is similar to the\ndrainage offsets restored by 80\u2013100 km between 30\u0001 and\n38\u0001E by Westaway [1994] and the 85 \u00b1 5 km offset of a\nTethyan suture reported at 38\u0001E by Seymen [1975]. Other,\nshorter offsets are summarized by Barka [1992], and longer\nestimates by Bozkurt [2001], but \u000180\u201385 km is emerging\nas a consensus figure for most of the length of the fault zone\n[Barka et al., 2000; Bozkurt, 2001].\n[36] There is evidence for distributed strike-slip and\/or\nextension within regions now cut through by the North\nAnatolian Fault [e.g., Tu\u00a8ysu\u00a8z et al., 1998; Coskun, 2000].\nBarka and Hancock [1984] suggested that a broad right-\nlateral shear zone operated toward the end of the Tortonian\n(\u00017 Ma), replaced by activity along the present main strand\nof the North Anatolian Fault in the early Pliocene. Bozkurt\n[2001] also concluded that faulting began at \u00015 Ma, based\non a review of studies of individual sections of the fault\nzone. One place where there is a precise age for the onset of\ndeformation is the Adapazar\u0001 pull-apart basin, along the\nwest of the fault zone at \u000140.7\u0001N 30.5\u0001E: rodent fossils\ndate the onset of sedimentation in this fault-related basin as\nlatest Pliocene [U\u00a8nay et al., 2001].\n[37] In summary, a long-term extrapolation of the GPS-\nderived slip rate along the North Anatolian Fault (24 \u00b1\n1 mm yr\u00021) would achieve the finite offset of 80\u201385 km in\n\u00013.5 million years [McClusky et al., 2000], less than the\n\u00015 million years estimated for activity along the modern\nfault trace.\n7. Alborz\n[38] The Alborz range in northern Iran is roughly 600 km\nlong and 100 km across, running along the southern side of\nthe Caspian Sea (Figure 1). Active, range-parallel, left-\nlateral strike-slip faults trend ENE in the east of the Alborz,\nWNW in the west, as far west as 49\u0001E [Berberian, 1997;\nJackson et al., 2002; Allen et al., 2003a]. Roughly north-\nsouth shortening takes place via thrusts which dip inward\nfrom both sides of the range (Figure 4). Sedimentary and\nvolcanic rocks of ages from late Precambrian to Quaternary\nare involved in the deformation. Igneous intrusions are rare,\nbut there both early and late Tertiary granitoids [Axen et al.,\n2001]. Unequivocal Precambrian basement is not exposed.\nThe active thrusting contrasts with the relative lack of\nactivity in central Iran to the south, and shows that Ara-\nbia-Eurasia convergence takes place north as well as south\nof the Turkish-Iranian plateau. The range has summits over\n4000 m, but crustal thicknesses are reportedly surprisingly\nlow for such mountainous terrain, at \u000135 km [Tatar, 2001].\n[39] At present there are no published GPS-based esti-\nmates for the shortening rate or strike-slip rate within the\nAlborz. If the overall Arabia-Eurasia convergence at the\nlongitude of the Alborz is \u000120 mm yr\u00021 [Sella et al., 2002]\nand \u000110 mm yr\u00021 of this is accommodated in the Zagros\n[Tatar et al., 2002], the convergence across the combined\nAlborz and South Caspian Basin should be roughly\n\u000110 mm yr\u00021 \u2013 discounting any small component from\ncentral Iran. This is substantially less than the 15\u2013\n20 mm yr\u00021 assumed by Jackson et al. [2002] based on\nearlier NUVEL 1A plate circuit values [DeMets et al., 1990,\n1994], which are now known to be too high [Sella et al.,\n2002]. Jackson et al. [2002] described how the motion\nbetween the South Caspian and Iran and between the South\nCaspian and Eurasia takes place along azimuths of roughly\n210\u0001 and somewhat north of 300\u0001, respectively. Using these\nazimuths, but a value for the overall Iran-Eurasia conver-\ngence of \u000110 mm yr\u00021, the resultant velocity triangle shows\nroughly 9 mm yr\u00021 convergence across the Alborz and\n5 mm yr\u00021 between the Caspian and Eurasia.\n[40] Total north-south shortening across the Alborz is\n\u000130 km (25\u201330%) at the longitude of Tehran, roughly\n51.5\u0001E, based on a structural cross-section [Allen et al.,\n2003a]. This is a minimum estimate. Restoration of a\ntruncated anticline shows that the eastern Mosha Fault has\na left-lateral offset of \u000130\u201335 km at 35.75\u0001N 52\u0001E\n[Geological Survey of Iran, 1987; Allen et al., 2003a].\n[41] Axen et al. [2001] documented \u00015\u20137 km of exhu-\nmation in the north central Alborz since \u00017 Ma, presumably\ncaused by the onset or acceleration of compressional defor-\nmation in the range. The range-parallel left-lateral strike-slip\nfaulting may have begun at this time. There are no indica-\ntions of active range-parallel right-lateral faulting, but this\noccurred before 7 Ma. Pliocene-Quaternary strata on either\nside of the Alborz and within intermontane basins are non-\nmarine clastics, and the successions generally coarsen\nup-section [Sto\u00a8cklin, 1971]. However, coarse continental\nclastics of presumed Oligo-Miocene age (\u000125 Ma) were\ndeposited in intermontane basins in the western Alborz\n[Annells et al., 1975], indicating at least some mid Tertiary\nsub-aerial relief.\n[42] If the present likely Alborz shortening rate of\n\u00019 mm yr\u00021 was maintained it would account for all of\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n9 of 16\nTC2008\nthe estimated finite shortening within 3\u20134 million years.\nThis is a shorter time than since the late Miocene (7 Ma) age\nfor the onset of rapid exhumation [Axen et al., 2001] and\nmuch less than the Oligo-Miocene age of initial Cenozoic\nsub-aerial relief in the range.\n8. Talesh\n[43] The Talesh (Talysh) is an arcuate fold and thrust belt\nin northwest Iran and Azerbaijan (Figure 6), which deforms\nPaleogene volcanics and deep marine clastics and a Neo-\ngene succession that broadly shallows upward [Allen et al.,\n2003b]. Summits reach \u00012000 m at the Iran-Azerbaijan\nborder, but the foreland of the range is below sea level at the\nmargin of the Caspian Sea. Seismogenic thrusts at the\neastern side of the range trend north-south, dip very gently\nwest, and have hypocenters in the depth range of 15\u201327 km\n[Jackson et al., 2002], showing that the basement to the\nTalesh presently overthrusts the South Caspian Basin to the\neast (Figures 2 and 6).\n[44] There are no published geodetic results for the active\nconvergence rate across the Talesh. Total shortening across\nthe northeast of the Talesh is estimated at \u000130 km, based on\na restoration of folds and thrusts [Jackson et al., 2002]. This\nis a similar value to the estimate for the Alborz to the\nsoutheast. There is no conclusive evidence for the time of\ninitial compressional deformation, but strata from around\nthe middle-late Miocene boundary (\u000110 Ma) display evi-\ndence for gravity flow processes [Vincent et al., 2002],\nwhich indicates significant relief at this time. Pliocene-\nQuaternary strata are folded at the northern margin of the\nrange, indicating young deformation [Geological Survey of\nIran, 1994].\n[45] Unfortunately, there are not enough data for the\nTalesh to compare short and long term deformation rates.\nIts structure shows that there is active shortening north of\nthe Turkish-Iranian plateau, and that deformation in this part\nof the collision zone is very three-dimensional.\n9. Kopet Dagh\n[46] The Kopet Dagh trends at 120\u0001\u2013300\u0001 for 700 km\nthrough northeast Iran and Turkmenistan between the Cas-\npian Sea and the Afghanistan border (Figure 1). It separates\nthe Turan region from central Iran, and so shows how plate\nconvergence happens at the northern side of the collision\nzone. The range is up to 3000 m in altitude, some 2000 m\nhigher than the Turkmen foreland to the north. Jurassic-\nFigure 6. Structure of the Greater Caucasus, Talesh, western South Caspian Basin and the northeast\nside of the Lesser Caucasus. Compiled from several sources, principally Nalivkin [1983] and Yakubov\nand Alizade [1971].\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n10 of 16\nTC2008\nMiocene marine carbonates and clastics were deposited\nacross a region now deformed into a series of folds and\nthrusts. The range is much broader in the west than the east,\nwhich may mean it rotates clockwise about its eastern limit.\nThe right-lateral Ashgabat Fault lies at the northern margin\nof the range [Trifonov, 1978]. This fault also has a compo-\nnent of thrust motion to the north [Priestley et al., 1994].\n[47] There are no published GPS results for the Kopet\nDagh. If the north-south convergence rate in the eastern\nZagros is at least the same as the central part (\u000110 mm yr\u00021),\nas argued above, it implies that the Kopet Dagh conver-\ngence may be \u000116 mm yr\u00021 at maximum, if the Sella et al.\n[2002] estimate of the overall Arabia-Eurasia convergence\nat this latitude is correct.\n[48] North-south shortening across the west of the range\nmay be \u000175 km, based on a line balanced section by\nLyberis and Manby [1999]. This represents \u000130% shorten-\ning of the 250 km wide western Kopet Dagh region. Further\neast, this is resolved into compression orthogonal to the\nAshgabat Fault and right-lateral slip along it. Lyberis and\nManby [1999] suggested that this shortening is principally\nPliocene-Quaternary in age, based on the deposition of\n4.5 km of Pliocene-Quaternary terrestrial clastics over an\nOligocene-late Miocene marine succession. Uplift was\napparently diachronous from east to west, based on Pliocene\nstrata being marine in the west but non-marine in the east\n[Lyberis and Manby, 1999]. However, Sto\u00a8cklin [1971] noted\nNeogene red bed clastics in the Iranian Kopet Dagh, which\nmay imply that deformation, sub-aerial relief and terrestrial\nsedimentation all began before the Pliocene.\n[49] If the likely maximum convergence rate of\n\u000116 mm yr\u00021 is representative of long-term deformation\nrates, it would take \u00015 million years to achieve the \u000175 km\nof total crustal shortening estimated for the range.\n10. South Caspian Basin\n[50] The basement to the South Caspian Basin has the\ngeophysical properties of unusually thick oceanic crust or\nthinned, high-velocity continental crust [Neprochnov, 1968;\nMangino and Priestley, 1998]. This basement is not ex-\nposed, being covered by a \u000120 km thickness of sedimentary\nrocks (Figure 4), about half of which is of Pliocene-\nQuaternary age [Ali-Zade et al., 1985]. Little is known of\nthe pre-Oligocene stratigraphy, but the Oligocene-lower\nPliocene succession shallows upward, culminating in the\nthick (up to 6 km) Productive Series, which was deposited\nin fluvial, lacustrine and deltaic settings [Devlin et al.,\n1999]. The age and original tectonic setting of the basement\nare not certain [Brunet et al., 2003], but it is likely that the\nSouth Caspian originated as a back-arc basin at some time\nin the Jurassic-Paleogene interval.\n[51] The interior of the South Caspian Basin is relatively\naseismic, compared with the mountain ranges around it\n[Priestley et al., 1994; Jackson et al., 2002]. Earthquakes\nat depths of \u000180 km along its northern side (Figure 2)\nsuggest northward underthrusting\/subduction beneath the\nmiddle Caspian region. This cannot have been happening\nfor a geologically long time, as the northern margins of the\nGreater Caucasus and Kopet Dagh are approximately co-\nlinear with the Apsheron Sill. This is a kinematically\nunstable configuration, given the opposite polarity of de-\nformation within the onshore and offshore regions, and\ncannot persist for long [Jackson et al., 2002]. Backstripping\nthe stratigraphy of the northwest of the basin indicates\n\u00012.4 km of tectonic subsidence in the Pliocene and Qua-\nternary [Allen et al., 2002], interpreted as the result of this\nyoung subduction.\n[52] Anticlines in the South Caspian Basin have a variety\nof orientations (Figure 6). A linear zone of folds at the north\nside of the basin form the Apsheron Sill, and presumably\nrelate to deeper underthrusting of South Caspian basement\nbeneath the middle Caspian. North-south folds at the\nwestern side of the basin relate to basement underthrusting\nto the west, beneath the Talesh. There may not be direct\nfault links between basement and cover. The anticlines are\nbuckle structures, which are detached from the basement\nalong mud-prone horizons within the thick sedimentary\nbasin fill [Devlin et al., 1999]. The overall strain is unlikely\nto be high, given the lack of evidence for major imbrication\nor crustal thickening. Line-balancing across each fold shows\nonly a few percent shortening [Devlin et al., 1999], and we\nextrapolate this across the basin to give a very approximate\nestimate of \u00015% visible north-south shortening in the\nsupra-detachment cover, equivalent to \u000115 km shortening\noverall.\n[53] Stratal pinchouts onto offshore folds are visible in\nlate Pliocene and younger strata, indicating that folding\nbegan at \u00013.4 Ma [Devlin et al., 1999]. Deformation in\nadjacent onshore folds may have begun \u00012 million years\nearlier [Aliev, 1960], given pinchouts onto folds in latest\nMiocene-early Pliocene strata.\n[54] In summary, synchronous deposition and deforma-\ntion of the South Caspian sedimentary cover of the South\nCaspian Basin in the last 3\u20135 million years is consistent\nwith incipient subduction of its rigid basement northward\nunder the middle Caspian region. The South Caspian region\nis unlikely to accommodate a major part of the Arabia-\nEurasia convergence. If the South Caspian-Eurasia motion\nis \u00015 mm yr\u00021, as described above in the section on the\nAlborz, it could achieve the 15 km of shortening estimated\nin the basin fill in 3 million years.\n11. Greater Caucasus\n[55] The Greater Caucasus range lies northeast of the\nBlack Sea and northwest of the South Caspian Basin\n(Figure 6). It lies along trend from the Kopet Dagh, and\nalso represents the zone of active deformation at the\nnorthern side of the Arabia-Eurasia collision.\n[56] The present structure of the Greater Caucasus indi-\ncates major late Cenozoic shortening and inversion of a\nMesozoic - lower Tertiary basin. The Moho under the range\nis at depths of up to 60 km [Ruppel and McNutt, 1990].\nPalaeozoic basement is exposed in dominantly southward-\ndirected thrust slices west of \u000144\u0001E. Mesozoic strata are\npresent in tight or isoclinal folds across the range all around\nthe exposed Palaeozoic core [Rogozhin and Sholpo, 1988;\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n11 of 16\nTC2008\nAllen et al., 2003b]. These folds are commonly associated\nwith thrusts. The vergence of these structures is predomi-\nnantly toward the south. However, there are north-directed\nstructures on the northern margin, especially in the northeast\n(Dagestan). Pliocene-Quaternary strata are folded into elon-\ngate, linear, south-vergent anticlines on the southern side of\nthe range, between the extant Kura and Rioni basins. Fault\nplane solutions show a predominance of thrusts that dip\ntoward the range interior [Philip et al., 1989; Triep et al.,\n1995; Jackson et al., 2002]. Late Cenozoic magmatism in\nthe range is Pliocene and Quaternary in age [Gazis et al.,\n1995].\n[57] GPS studies across both the Greater and Lesser\nCaucasus provide a minimum north-south shortening rate\nof 10 \u00b1 2 mm yr\u00021 [Reilinger et al., 1997], of which \u000160%\nis estimated to occur across the Greater Caucasus\n[McClusky et al., 2000]. These studies estimate overall\nshortening rates, but not where it occurs within the range.\nLarger magnitude earthquakes are concentrated at the mar-\ngins of the range, with epicenters predominantly in regions\nat altitudes of 1000 m or less (Figures 2 and 6 [Jackson,\n1992]). There is less seismicity in the west of the range,\nwhere the crystalline basement is exposed.\n[58] Estimates of overall shortening across the Greater\nCaucasus vary greatly, and we are not aware of published\nbalanced and restored cross-sections. Dotduyev [1986] sug-\ngested \u0001200 km across a 100 km long traverse through the\ncentral Caucasus, which represents \u000166% shortening. This\nseems high, given the preservation of unmetamorphosed\nMesozoic-Cenozoic strata across much of the range, but is\nconsistent with the range of 200\u2013300 km deduced by\nErshov et al. [2003] on the basis of simple area balancing\nrestoration of the whole crust in a transect at \u000144\u0001E.\nSobornov [1994] calculated 30\u201350 km (\u000125\u201340%) short-\nening across the Dagestan thrust belt in the northeastern\nGreater Caucasus, based on restoration of thrust sheets in\nthe Mesozoic-Cenozoic strata. If these Dagestan values are\nrepresentative for the entire range, they imply roughly\n130 km of shortening where the range is presently 200 km\nacross.\n[59] Stratigraphic evidence (e.g., olistostrome deposits) is\ninterpreted to mean compressional deformation within the\nGreater Caucasus during the late Eocene [Banks et al.,\n1997], and so may pre-date the initial continental collision.\nOligo-Miocene strata on the central northern side of the\nrange thicken southward, unlike underlying units [Ershov et\nal., 2003]: this may represent initial foreland basin devel-\nopment, and hence thrusting within the range. In the\nnortheastern Greater Caucasus (Dagestan), there was a\nswitch in paleocurrent direction from southwest- to north-\neast-directed in the late middle Miocene [Sobornov, 1994].\nUpper Miocene shallow marine strata in the eastern Greater\nCaucasus (Azerbaijan) are folded and exposed [Azizbekov,\n1972]. Provenance data for the uppermost Miocene-Plio-\ncene succession in the northwest of the South Caspian Basin\nshow an increase in the proportion of sand derived from the\nGreater Caucasus within this interval [Morton et al., 2003].\nSummarizing these data, there is evidence for mid-Tertiary\nuplift, foreland basin development and presumably defor-\nmation of the Greater Caucasus; the area involved has\napparently increased over time.\n[60] The Greater Caucasus is an area of the collision\nwhere the present shortening rate cannot account for all the\nobserved strain in a few million years: the present shorten-\ning rate (\u00016 mm yr\u00021) needs to be extrapolated for\n\u000122 million years to account for the lower estimate for\nthe finite shortening (\u0001130 km). Thirty to 50 million years\nwould be needed to account for the shortening estimates of\n200\u2013300 km at this rate.\n12. Discussion\n[61] Extrapolating present-day deformation rates for 3\u2013\n7 million years produces displacements that equal or exceed\nthe total deformation on many of fault systems currently\nactive in the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone, including the\nZagros Simple Folded Zone, the North and East Anatolian\nfaults, the South Caspian Basin and the Alborz and Kopet\nDagh ranges (Table 1). This age range is much shorter than\nthe overall age of the collision, which began in the early\nMiocene (16\u201323 Ma) or earlier [Hempton, 1987; Y\u0001lmaz,\n1993; Robertson, 2000]. It seems that the collision zone has\nnot absorbed the overall plate convergence in the same way\nthroughout its history, unless for some unknown reason slip\nrates on the active fault systems are consistently higher than\nlong-term averages.\n[62] There may have been a regional reorganization of the\ncollision at \u00015 \u00b1 2 Ma, as suggested by several authors\n[e.g., Wells, 1969; Quennell, 1984; Westaway, 1994; Axen et\nal., 2001]. This is the time when deformation started or\nintensified in many of the currently active regions, such as\nthe East and North Anatolian faults, the South Caspian\nBasin and possibly the Kopet Dagh [Barka et al., 2000;\nWestaway and Arger, 2001; Devlin et al., 1999; Lyberis and\nManby, 1999]. This is also the timeframe of rapid exhuma-\ntion in the Alborz [Axen et al., 2001], and initial deposition\nof the Bakhtyari Formation within the deforming Zagros\nSimple Folded Zone [James and Wynd, 1965]. Suggestions\nfor the cause of this reorganization include the opening of\nthe Red Sea [Wells, 1969], the arrival of buoyant Arabian\nlithosphere \u2018\u2018choking\u2019\u2019 the Neo-Tethyan subduction zone\n[Axen et al., 2001], the final closure of oceanic basins\nwithin Iran [Jackson et al., 2002] and the elevation of the\nTurkish-Iranian plateau [Allen et al., 2002].\n[63] Oceanic spreading in the Red Sea would only cause\nreorganization of the Arabia-Eurasia collision if conver-\ngence rates increased, but there is no strong evidence for\nthis in the history of the Dead Sea Fault System or the Red\nSea [Sneh, 1996; McQuarrie et al., 2003]. Nor is it obvious\nwhy an increase in convergence should require a reorgani-\nzation of deformation within the collision zone, rather than\nan increase in strain rates on existing fault systems. It is not\nproven that there was a change in the nature of the Arabian\nlithosphere entering the collision zone at the end of the\nMiocene; more work is needed on the High Zagros to\nexamine this idea. In any case, late Miocene terrestrial\nclastics within the Simple Folded Zone were derived from\nthe northeast [Elmore and Farrand, 1981], suggesting that\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n12 of 16\nTC2008\nthe Arabian plate was solidly docked to Eurasia before the\nPliocene. If there were oceanic basins within Iran as\nrecently as the middle-late Miocene, they have yet to be\nidentified.\n[64] Seismogenic thrusts (Figure 2) and GPS data show\nthat active shortening is concentrated both north and south\nof the Turkish-Iranian plateau. The Turkish-Iranian plateau\nhas little evidence for internal shortening at present, but\nmust have undergone shortening, thickening and surface\nuplift since 12 Ma, which is the age of the youngest\nrecorded marine sediments within it [Dewey et al., 1986].\nParts of the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone and the Alborz were sub-\naerially exposed before 12 Ma, given the pinch out of the\nlower Miocene Qom Formation against the margins of these\nregions [Sto\u00a8cklin, 1971]. The Greater Caucasus, which was\nuplifted and presumably deforming in the mid-Tertiary or\nearlier [Mikhailov et al., 1999], is presently shortening at\n\u00016 mm yr\u00021 [McClusky et al., 2000]. The range has poorly-\nconstrained finite shortening (but \u0001130 km is the lower\nrange of estimates), and thick crust (up to \u000160 km [Ruppel\nand McNutt, 1990]). Earthquakes are concentrated at lower\nelevations, below 1000 m, and away from the crystalline\nbasement. This suggests that shortening is focused at the\nrange margins, and not higher, more exhumed, regions, and\nmay mean that shortening in the Greater Caucasus migrates\ninto its forelands once thick crust has been achieved. It is\nnot clear whether this change has occurred gradually since\nthe mid-Tertiary, or by abrupt reorganization(s). The Plio-\ncene is a candidate time for a reorganization, given the onset\nof magmatism within the range [Gazis et al., 1995] and the\nincreased contribution of sand from the Greater Caucasus\ndeposited in the adjacent South Caspian Basin [Morton et\nal., 2003]. Therefore the Greater Caucasus is similar to the\nTurkish-Iranian plateau in several ways: seismicity, and\npresumably shortening, is focused on lower altitude areas\nat its margins, present convergence rates across the range\nFigure 7. Pattern of deformation across the Arabia-Eurasia collision, highlighting areas where crustal\nthickening occurred since 12 Ma but not significantly at present (Turkish-Iranian plateau and interior of\nthe Greater Caucasus), and mainly since \u00017 Ma (Zagros Simple Folded Zone, Alborz, South Caspian\nBasin, Kopet Dagh, and Greater Caucasus foothills).\nTC2008 ALLEN ET AL.: ARABIA-EURASIA COLLISION\n13 of 16\nTC2008\nare inadequate to account for total shortening and crustal\nthickening since the late Miocene, structural and strati-\ngraphic evidence point to pre-late Miocene shortening and\nsurface uplift.\n[65] We suggest that once thick crust built up in the\nTurkish-Iranian plateau and the interior of the Greater\nCaucasus, convergence took place more easily by crustal\nshortening in less elevated regions with initially thinner\ncrust, such as the Zagros Simple Folded Zone, South\nCaspian region, Kopet Dagh and the foothills of the Greater\nCaucasus (Figure 7). There are similarities with the late\nCenozoic behavior of the Tibetan plateau [England and\nHouseman, 1988; Molnar et al., 1993]; it is easier to absorb\ncontinental shortening in regions of thin crust and low\nelevations, than areas that have undergone shortening and\nsurface uplift and consequently have increased buoyancy\nforces that resist further shortening. Like the Puna-Altiplano\nplateau of the Andes [Sobel et al., 2003], internal drainage\nand ponding of sediment within the basins of the Turkish-\nIranian plateau act to increase the gravitational potential\nenergy of the region [Willett and Beaumont, 1994]. West-\nward transport of Turkey between the North and East\nAnatolian faults has also accommodated part of the plate\nconvergence since \u00013\u20135 Ma. Inactive strike-slip faults in\nAnatolia may have performed this role before activity began\non the present structures [Westaway and Arger, 2001].\n[66] Delamination of part of the mantle lithosphere has\nbeen suggested as the cause of the magmatism and a\ncontributor to the Turkish-Iranian plateau\u2019s present eleva-\ntion [Pearce et al., 1990]. In support of this idea, the plateau\nhas a seismic shear wave low velocity zone and a long\nwavelength gravity high (50 mgals at a wavelength of\n\u0001800 km) [Hearn and Ni, 1994; Maggi et al., 2002], both\nof which indicate an increase in mantle temperature beneath\nat least part of the plateau. However, magmatism dates back\nto at least 11 Ma [Keskin et al., 1998], and pre-dates at least\nsome shortening [National Iranian Oil Company, 1977b],\nmaking it unlikely that there was a sudden and regional\ndelamination event.\n[67] In some of the actively deforming areas there is a\ngood match between the finite deformation, and the value\nreached by extrapolating the active slip rate by the time over\nwhich deformation is known to have occurred. Specific\nexamples are the East Anatolian Fault, the Kopet Dagh and\nthe South Caspian Basin (Table 1). Other areas are incon-\nclusive, because either the timing of deformation or the total\nslip is not known in enough detail. The Alborz, Zagros and\neastern Iran are in this category.\n[68] The short- and long-term slip rates on the North\nAnatolian Fault have previously been suggested to match\n[McClusky et al., 2000; Bozkurt, 2001], although the GPS-\nderived rate for active slip (24 \u00b1 1 mm yr\u00021) extrapolates to\n120 \u00b1 5 km over 5 million years, which is greater than the\nconsensus value for the finite slip of 80\u201385 km [Barka et\nal., 2000]. More work is needed to see if this mismatch is\nbecause the active slip rate is indeed faster than the long-\nterm average value, or because there are errors in the\nestimates for the finite slip, timing of fault initiation, or\nboth. It is notable that a late Pliocene age for fault initiation\n[U\u00a8nay et al., 2001] would produce a closer match between\nshort-term and average long-term behavior (24 mm yr\u00021\nover \u00013 million years equals \u000172 km).\n[69] In summary, available data suggest that the present\ndeformation rates on major active fault systems would\naccount for the finite strain in these areas in \u00013\u20137 million\nyears, i.e., no further back than the late Miocene. Either the\nmodern slip rates are significantly faster than the long-term\naverage rates \u2013 for which there is no evidence, or pre-late\nMiocene strain in the collision took place in other areas or in\nother ways. The most likely areas are the Turkish-Iranian\nplateau and, possibly, the interior of the Greater Caucasus,\nwhere there is little sign of active shortening in regions of\nelevated and thickened crust, but evidence for shortening\nand uplift before the late Miocene. The timing, style and\nduration of the changeover to the actively shortening areas\nneed further study.\n[70] Acknowledgments.
