It occurs \nat other central volcanoes (e.g. Katla, H\u00f6fsj\u00f6kull) and in isolated volcanoes (e.g. \nH\u00e1g\u00f6ngur). The only published account of facies and emplacement mechanisms of \nsubglacial rhyolite (Furnes et al., 1980) included generalised descriptions of lava \nlobe-hyaloclastite formations at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur and elsewhere. Two discrete types of \nhyaloclastite were identified, one dominated by pumice clasts (type 1) and a mixed \nobsidian-microcrystalline rhyolite lava hyaloclastite (type 2). Type 1 was envisaged to \nhave formed during explosive magma degassing from lobes of rhyolite lava, and type \n2 from brittle spalling of lobe fragments.  \n Various authors have conducted detailed lithofacies analysis of subaqueously \nemplaced rhyolite (Yamagishi & Dimroth 1985, Cas et al. 1990, Hanson 1991, Scutter \net al. 1998, Hunns & McPhie, 1999) and subglacial basalt (Smellie et al. 1993, \nSkilling 1994, Smellie & Skilling 1994, Smellie & Hole 1997, Werner et al. 1996, \nWerner & Schmincke 1999). These studies have shed light on mechanisms of rhyolite \nlava-water interaction (e.g. Yamagishi & Dimroth 1985, Hunns & McPhie 1999) and \non the interplay between eruptive mechanisms and glacier response (e.g. Smellie & \nSkilling 1994). Eruptions of rhyolite and basalt magmas under ice are likely to differ \nfrom eruptions under water because of significant differences in the physical \nenvironment (Table 1a). Different magma types are also likely to produce different \nsubglacial eruption styles (Table 1b). Silicic tephra layers in Greenland ice cores are \nthought to originate from subglacial rhyolite eruptions in Iceland (Zielinski et al., \n1997). A similar origin has been attributed to tephra layers in Icelandic glaciers \n(Larsen et al., 1998), on the Atlantic sea floor (Lacasse et al., 1995) and in Scottish \npeat (Dugmore et al., 1995). Ice-covered rhyolite volcanoes thus appear capable of \nmajor explosive eruptions, emphasizing the need for further study. \n \n \nGeological setting \nThe Torfaj\u00f6kull volcanic complex, Iceland's largest rhyolite centre, is located where \nthe southerly propagating Eastern Rift Zone meets the South Eastern Zone, an older \ncrustal segment (Fig. 1). Activity began in mid Quaternary time (S\u00e6mundsson 1972), \nforming a now highly dissected rhyolite plateau measuring 18 km by 12 km. The total \nvolume of this plateau, 250 km3, is dominated by rhyolite erupted in subglacial and \nsubaerial environments, with minor basaltic hyaloclastites and fluvioglacial \nsediments. The youngest subglacial rhyolite volcano at Torfaj\u00f6kull appears to be \nBl\u00e1hn\u00fakur. This is an isolated, small volume edifice in the northern part of the \ncomplex (Fig. 2).  \n  \n \nOverall structure of Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur \n \nBl\u00e1hn\u00fakur rises 350 m above a dissected plain of altered Quaternary rhyolite.  \nRoughly pyramidal in form, it has a core of older rhyolite draped by a veneer of \nyoung subglacial rhyolite, henceforth called Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur rhyolite (Figure 3). The drape \n 3 \nadds approximately 50 m to its height (Fig. 3). Massive orange-brown diamicton \nunderlies the subglacial sequence on the south flanks of Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur. This diamicton, \nwhich locally exceeds 20 m in thickness, contains cobbles of altered basalt and \nrhyolite lava set in a muddy matrix. The Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur rhyolite appears to have been \nemplaced along four distinct fissures, trending from WSW-ENE to NW-SE (Fig. 4). \nThese fissures do not follow the regional tectonic fabric (NE-SW). Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur \nrhyolite, which differs from the subglacial rhyolite of neighbouring volcanoes in both \nits freshness and chemistry (S\u00e6mundsson 1972, Ivarsson 1992), appears to be the \nproduct of an isolated, small-volume effusive eruption during the last glacial period \n(i.e. 115-11 ka ago). Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur rhyolite contains a minor proportion of basaltic \ninclusions, a feature also typical of postglacial rhyolite lava flows at Torfaj\u00f6kull \n(McGarvie, 1984). \n \nEvidence for a subglacial environment \n \nAlthough there is no single feature that provides unambiguous evidence for a \nsubglacial eruptive setting, the following features suggest that Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur rhyolite was \nerupted under ice: \n1. Much of the sequence consists of breccias, which show evidence for magma-water \ninteraction (perlitised obsidian, blocky ash shards, fines-rich veins, matrix vesicles). \nThere is no evidence for the existence of a palaeotopography which could have \nconfined a non-glacial lake (c.f. Jones 1969, Smellie & Skilling 1994, Smellie & Hole \n1997). The lack of fossils, as well as the current elevation of 600-945 m in the \nabsence of any tectonic structures consistent with uplift, precludes a submarine \nsetting. Glacier melting is thus the most likely source of water. \n2. Columnar jointing patterns suggest that many lava bodies in the sequence chilled \nagainst steeply inclined, sub-planar surfaces. Such jointing patterns, which have not \nbeen found in subaqueous or subaerial rhyolite lavas (e.g. Scutter et al. 1998, Fink \n1983) are best explained by the chilling of lavas against ice walls (Lescinsky & \nSisson, 1998). \n3. One lithology within the Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur complex contains rounded, facetted clasts and a \nmud matrix consistent with a subglacial derivation (i.e. till). \n \n \nLithofacies descriptions and interpretations \n \nVolcaniclastic lithofacies were distinguished in the field using bedding characteristics, \nplus the type, size and morphology of clasts (McPhie et al., 1993). The crystallinity, \nmorphology, vesicularity and jointing patterns of coherent volcanic lithofacies are \nalso described. 'Juvenile' is used to refer to products of the subglacial Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur \nrhyolite eruption, whereas 'lithic' refers to clasts derived from the underlying \nbasement. \n \nMixed juvenile-lithic lithofacies \n \nGravelly sandstone & conglomerate \n \nDescription \n 4 \nThe gravelly sandstone & conglomerate lithofacies occurs as a 5-14 m thick sequence \non the southern bank of Gr\u00e6nagil 1 km upstream of the bridge (Fig. 5). At the base, a \n0.5-5 m thick unit of orange-brown massive to planar bedded matrix-supported lithic \nconglomerate lies in an inclined erosive channel cut into basaltic pillow breccia. \nUpper and lower surfaces are sharp, the channel pinching out laterally over ~ 100 m. \nThe conglomerate contains sub-rounded to rounded, facetted cobbles of altered \naphyric rhyolitic and basaltic lava up to 30 cm in diameter in a mud-grade orange-\nbrown matrix. It is devoid of juvenile material.  \nA 1-6 m thick gravelly sandstone unit overlying the conglomerate (Fig. 5) is \nmoderately well sorted and laterally continuous over at least 100 m. In general, the \ngravelly sandstone comprises sub-planar beds 10-30 cm thick. However dune-like \ncross-stratification is also developed, with a wavelength of ~ 3 m. Over 95 % of clasts \nconsist of juvenile phenocryst-rich black obsidian and grey perlitised vesicular \nobsidian. Clasts are angular to sub-angular and 0.5-2 cm across. Sub-rounded 0.5-1 \ncm lithic clasts of altered aphyric rhyolite and basalt lava make up the remainder of \nthe deposit. The matrix consists of sand-grade angular clasts of juvenile obsidian. \nA 3 m-thick brown breccia-conglomerate unit is locally present at the top of \nthe sequence, comprising 10-20 cm thick matrix-supported lithic-rich breccia horizons \nintercalated with 3-10 cm thick beds of conglomerate. This unit is overlain by 1 m of \ncemented brown conglomerate. At the northern limit of this exposure, lithics in the \ngravelly sandstone disappear 3 m above the erosive base (Fig. 5). It is overlain by \npoorly sorted juvenile breccias (breccia C). \n \nInterpretation \nThe channelised, poorly sorted conglomerate is similar to units on Mt Pinafore, \nAlexander Island, Antarctica (Smellie et al., 1993; Smellie & Skilling, 1994), which \nwere interpreted as meltout tills formed by the redeposition of till by meltwater within \na subglacial cavity. A similar interpretation is made here. The sorting, horizontal and \ncross stratification and sharp boundaries of the gravelly sandstone units suggest \ndeposition from a traction current (Smellie et al., 1993). The presence of interbedded \nlithic- and juvenile-dominated units suggests that pulses of juvenile material entered \nthe subglacial cavity, probably washed from the vent area by a stream of volcanically-\ngenerated meltwater. This syn-eruptive lithofacies occurs 350 m vertically below the \nhighest subglacial rhyolite deposits. Hence we infer that meltwater drainage occurred \nduring the eruption beneath a glacier at least 350 m thick.  \n \nJuvenile lithofacies \n \nLava lobe-breccia A \n \nDescription \nThis lithofacies dominates the western flank of Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur (Fig. 4, Fig. 6a). It is best \nexposed about 250 m northwest of the summit and on the south bank of Gr\u00e6nagil \nbetween 100 and 150 m upstream of the bridge. It consists of 5-20 m dark, irregularly \nto cylindrically shaped obsidian and microcrystalline rhyolite lobes set in pale grey \nbreccia. Lobes can be subdivided into flow lobes and feeder lobes. Flow lobes have \ncurvicolumnar jointed obsidian upper surfaces, whereas their bases are gradational \nwith the surrounding breccia (Fig. 6b). Flow banding is roughly parallel to the \npresent-day slope. Vesicularity increases from <5% within the microcrystalline \nrhyolite core to ~10% in the 5-50 cm thick upper obsidian selvage. At the base of \n 5 \nflow lobes, the obsidian becomes paler and increasingly perlitised. The proportion of \nelongate vesicles increases to 20-30% at the base, giving the obsidian a pumiceous \nappearance. The perlitised material becomes increasingly fractured at the outer \nmargin, and grades outwards into massive, poorly sorted breccia, containing angular \nclasts of pale grey perlitised obsidian in an ash matrix (Fig. 6b). This matrix contains \nspherical vesicles generally 1-3 mm, but up to 20 mm long. Perlitised obsidian clasts \nare 0.5-30 cm across and contain 15-40% elongate vesicles. Ash particles are glassy \nwith blocky morphologies and typically 10-100 \u00b5m across. The breccia is cut by \nanastamosing irregular veins 5-30 mm wide, filled with vesiculated ash. These \nterminate at the obsidian lobe margin (Fig. 6b). \nFeeder lobes are irregular to sheet-like in morphology and typically 5-20 m \nacross. They are distinguished from flow lobes by the orientation of their flow \nbanding, which dips into the edifice, mostly at 30 to 60\u00b0. An obsidian margin 10-50 \ncm wide envelops a hackly jointed microcrystalline interior, which is often orange \ncoloured due to alteration. Locally, flow banding in feeder lobes is seen to continue \ninto a flow lobe (Fig. 6b). \n \nInterpretation \nThe gradational contact between the base of flow lobes and breccia suggests in situ \nfragmentation of the lobes. Pumiceous, perlitised clasts and ash were created at lobe \nbases, which were in contact with earlier-formed breccia. A similar suite of textures \noccurs in rhyolitic pumiceous peperite emplaced in a submarine setting at Mt. \nChalmers Queensland, Australia (Hunns & McPhie, 1999). The increase in \nvesicularity from the core to rim of lobes (Furnes et al., 1980) suggests that magmatic \nvolatiles diffused outward from the lobe interior. Moderate vesicularity results from \nemplacement at a relatively low confining pressure (likely glaciostatic pressure ~ 4 \nMPa) and the formation of a glassy rind, which favoured volatile retention (Hunns & \nMcPhie, 1999). The presence of microcrystalline lava lobe cores indicates that the \ncooling time of individual lobes was sufficiently long for crystallisation. However, \ncooling timescales can only be estimated (e.g. Hoskuldsson & Sparks, 1997), since \nthe rate of microlite growth in rhyolitic magma is poorly constrained (e.g. Higgins, \n1996). Furnes et al. (1980) labelled this lithofacies type 1 hyaloclastite, and suggested \nthat fragmentation was driven by magma vesiculation. We question this interpretation, \nsince the blocky morphology of ash shards suggests that fragmentation was \ndominantly phreatomagmatic and driven by quenching, rapid glass contraction and \nsteam explosivity (Heiken & Wohletz, 1985). We suggest that the lava lobes represent \nthe subglacial equivalent of an effusive rhyolite eruption, in which fragmentation due \nto volatile exsolution was minimal. Furthermore, perlitic alteration is an indication \nthat water interacted with lobe margins, and vesiculated ash may indicate that a \nvapour phase was present (Lorenz, 1974, Hunns & McPhie 1999). By contrast, the top \nand sides of lobes are glassy and intact, with columnar joints normal to steeply \ninclined, subplanar surfaces (Fig. 6b). Similar columnar joint patterns in lavas on Mt \nRainier, Washington, are thought to be an ice-contact feature, formed as lava chilled \nagainst steeply inclined ice walls (Lescinsky & Sisson 1998). We adopt a similar \ninterpretation here, and infer that lobe sides chilled against ice with explosive magma-\nmeltwater interaction. \nThe orientation of lobes is bimodal, with feeder lobes dipping into the modern \nslope and flow lobes dipping at an angle parallel to the modern slope. A similar \nbimodal pattern was seen in subaqueous rhyolite hyaloclastite in Japan (Yamagishi & \nDimroth, 1985). The interpretation at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur is that magma rose in sheets or \n 6 \nfingers to the base of the glacier, where it flowed a limited distance down-slope over \nwater-saturated breccias, before freezing against a constraining ice wall (Furnes et al., \n1980). Rising magma locally ponded within the breccia, forming irregular intrusions.  \n \nBreccia B \n \nDescription \nThis lithofacies is best seen on the south bank of Gr\u00e6nagil, in cliffs 10-30 m high \ndirectly upstream of the bridge (Fig. 4). Much larger but less well-exposed outcrops \nare found on the north flank of the central ridge, the west flank of the west ridge and \ndirectly east of the summit. In Gr\u00e6nagil, massive to crudely-bedded matrix- and clast- \nsupported green breccias host elongate to lenticular ribbons and blobs of obsidian \n(Fig. 7a). Ribbons are typically 0.5-5 m long and 5-50 cm wide. The breccias consist \nof pumiceous, perlitised obsidian clasts, typically 0.5-5 cm across, set in an ash matrix \nof angular glass shards. The ash contains spherical to irregular voids 1-3 mm in \ndiameter. Irregular, anastamosing pale green ash-filled veins 0.5-3 cm wide cut the \noutcrop. Obsidian ribbons are displaced up to 15 cm where they are cut by these \nveins. Vesicles in the ribbons are locally sheared parallel to veins (Fig. 7b), indicating \nductile deformation. The abundance of vesicles is fairly uniform within the ribbons, \nand does not increase close to the sharp contact with the surrounding breccia. A \ncentimetre-wide zone of brown, indurated ash occurs at the margin of some ribbons. \nMany ribbons are aligned along a plane that dips at about 10\u00b0 into the modern-day \nslope (Fig. 7a). The deposit is cut by a number of low-angle near-planar faults, on \nwhich the sense of displacement is unclear. \n \nInterpretation \nDeformed vesicles adjacent to veins cutting some obsidian ribbons (Fig. 7b) indicate \nthat the ribbons were deformed whilst still hot (White & Busby-Spera 1987, Hunns & \nMcPhie 1999). However, the sharp contact between the ribbons and surrounding \nbreccia indicates that the lobes did not generate the surrounding breccia. Rather, hot \nribbons and blobs and the enclosing breccia appear to have been deposited together in \na hot debris avalanche. This is likely to have been due to the syn-emplacement \ngravitational collapse of lava lobe-breccia A. Collapse events may have been \ntriggered as the supporting ice melted back. Fines in the breccia may have been \nremobilised by steam fluxing shortly after emplacement. Instability at this stage could \nhave created numerous semi-brittle fault planes, into which ash was transported, \ngenerating ash-filled veins. Vesiculated ash may be further evidence for an active \nvapour phase (Lorenz 1974, Hunns & McPhie 1999). It is notable that the glass of the \nobsidian ribbons is microlite-poor, in contrast with the microlite-rich cores of lava \nlobes. This is consistent with the model that lava lobes fell apart whilst still above the \nglass transition temperature, leading to relatively rapid cooling. This lithofacies is \ninterpreted as a hot avalanche deposit and illustrates the instability of the subglacial \nrhyolite edifice during its growth.  \n \nBreccia C  \n \nDescription \nThis lithofacies crops out in Gr\u00e6nagil (500-1000 m upstream of the bridge) and on the \nnorth flank, 50 m north of the summit (Figure 4). In Gr\u00e6nagil it forms a chaotic \nsequence 10-20 m thick, comprising fragments of rhyolite lava lobes 1-20 m long in \n 7 \ncontact with lenses of breccia and cut by abundant small faults (Fig. 8). Lenses of \nmassive, moderately well-sorted pumiceous and dense obsidian breccia (0.2-1 m \nacross) are faulted against lobe portions, which consist of hackly to columnar jointed \nflow banded microcrystalline rhyolite and obsidian. Pods of rubbly breccia locally cut \nthe microcrystalline rhyolite, discordant to flow banding. There is a 5 cm-thick zone \nof clast-supported breccia at the faulted contact between obsidian and microcrystalline \nlobe portions. The breccia consists of obsidian clasts adjacent to the intact obsidian \ndomains of lava lobes and microcrystalline rhyolite clasts adjacent to the \nmicrocrystalline rhyolite domains, with a zone of clast mingling ~1 cm wide on the \nfault plane (Fig. 8). A major set of sub-parallel faults dips into the slope at 60\u00b0 to 70\u00b0. \nThese cut a second set of randomly orientated, smaller faults. Clasts in the \nmicrocrystalline rhyolite and obsidian breccias are vesicle-poor (<1% irregular \nvesicles <4 mm long) and blocky in shape, typically 5-20 cm across. By contrast, 0.5-\n5 cm angular clasts in the pumiceous breccia contain 20% elongate vesicles. On the \nnorth flank, this lithofacies forms a downslope-dipping veneer <5 m thick, overlying \nlava lobe-breccia A. Veins of fine-grained ash in lava lobe-breccia A lithofacies \nabruptly terminate at the base of breccia C. \n \nInterpretation \nBreccia C consists largely of fragments of lava lobes with lesser amounts of \npumiceous breccia. The faulted juxtaposition of several diverse lithologies, with \nbrecciation and clast mingling at faulted contacts indicates lateral movement, possibly \nduring sliding of lava lobe-breccia A down the flanks of the accumulating pile. Our \ninterpretation is that accompanying fragmentation has been slight, resulting in the \nstacking of numerous near-intact lobe fragments against each other. There is no \nevidence for high temperatures or the presence of water during emplacement. This \nlithofacies is thus thought to record en masse slumping events, in which quenched \nlobes and breccia slid down slope.  \n \n \nBreccia D \n \nDescription \nThis lithofacies crops out on the south bank of Gr\u00e6nagil about 150 m upstream of the \nbridge and on the eastern flank, where it forms a prominent outcrop ~20 m high \nFigure 4). It is a poorly-sorted matrix-supported polymict breccia, containing 1-30 cm \nangular clasts of microcrystalline rhyolite, dense black obsidian and grey-white \npumiceous, perlitised obsidian set in an ash matrix. Faint bedding, which is picked out \nby trails of large clasts, dips at about 10\u00b0 into the local slope. Angular clasts of \nmicrocrystalline rhyolite are bounded by joint planes, which truncate flow banding. \nPumiceous clasts contain ~30% vesicles by volume, and ash particles resemble those \nfound in breccia A. Irregular bodies of perlitised obsidian intrude the deposit on the \neast flank. These display tiny (1-2 cm wide) columns close to the contact with the \nbreccia.  \n \nInterpretation \nThis facies corresponds to the type 2 hyaloclastite of Furnes et al. (1980), who \nsuggested that it was formed by explosive fracture of the chilled carapace of lava \nlobes. Whereas such a mechanism may have generated obsidian and rhyolite clasts, \nwe suspect that breccia D represents remobilized lava lobe-breccia A. Poor sorting is \n 8 \nconsistent with emplacement in a cohesive mass flow (Smellie & Skilling 1994). \nClasts are entirely juvenile and exactly match the range of textures observed in lava \nlobe-breccia A. Joint-bounded microcrystalline rhyolite clasts indicate that the core of \nlobes had substantially cooled prior to fragmentation. From our observations of \nbreccia B we know that lava lobe-breccia A was unstable during emplacement. Our \npreferred model for the emplacement of breccia D involves the gravitational collapse \nof quenched lava lobes and breccia, caused by the withdrawal of supporting ice walls. \nAccompanying fragmentation appears to have been more extensive than in breccia C, \nsince no lobe portions have survived intact. This may indicate a greater transport \ndistance or a more energetic debris flow than that which generated breccia C.  \n \nColumnar-jointed lava \n \nDescription \nLarge columnar-jointed lava flows occur on the eastern and southern flanks of \nBl\u00e1hn\u00fakur. A lava flow 200 m long and 20 m thick drapes the steep southern flank \ndirectly south of the summit (Fig. 4). It has a triangular cross section and is bounded \nby three sub-planar columnar jointed surfaces: two steeply-inclined walls (~60-70\u00b0 \ndip) and a base parallel to the modern day slope (~30\u00b0 dip). Columnar joints are 10-30 \ncm apart and normal to flow margins. They penetrate to the centre of the flow. An \nobsidian selvage up to 5 m thick envelops a microcrystalline rhyolite interior, which \ncontains <1% irregular vesicles. At the southern tip of the lava, the base grades into \nhydrothermally altered, perlitised obsidian breccia.  \nThe largest lava flow observed is on the east flank (Fig. 4). It is sheet-like in \nmorphology, ~20 m thick and 400 m wide. The main lava body appears to feed a \nnumber of tube-like apophyses, such as the 20 m-thick lava pictured in Fig. 9a. The \ntube-like lava is triangular in cross section, with a set of columnar joints normal to \nboth the steeply inclined sides and  the gently inclined base. Flow banding is parallel \nto the lava margins. There is a sharp contact between the microcrystalline flow \ninterior and 4 m-thick intact obsidian selvages (Fig. 9a). Perlite and breccia are absent \nfrom the lava base, and there is a locally peperitic contact with the underlying poorly-\nconsolidated till. At the southwestern limit of the sheet-like lava, columnar joints \ndescribe a spectacular box-like form (Fig. 9b). Columnar joints in the glassy lava top, \nsides and base are spaced 10-15 cm apart and are normal to flow margins. \n \n \nInterpretation \nAndesite lava flows on Mt Rainier, Washington, have similar attributes: steeply \ninclined flow sides with subhorizontal columns and thick glassy margins (Lescinsky \n& Sisson, 1998). Columnar joints develop normal to cooling surfaces (Degraff et al. \n1989), so the orientation of columns can be used to reconstruct three-dimensional \ncooling patterns. Hence the columnar-jointed sides of the Mt Rainier lavas were \ninterpreted as ice-contact features, formed as the lava flowed and chilled against ice \nwalls. Unlike those on Mt Rainier, the lavas of Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur also have columnar-jointed \nflow tops, which suggest cooling either by meltwater running over the lava \n(S\u00e6mundsson 1970) or by direct contact with a subhorizontal ice roof. We thus infer a \nsubglacial setting for the columnar jointed lavas, which may have flowed and chilled \nwithin tunnel-like cavities melted into the basal ice. There is limited evidence for \nmagma-water interaction, with perlitisation and peperite restricted to lava bases, \n 9 \nsuggesting that there was little meltwater present within the cavities during \nemplacement of the lavas. \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nRelative rates of ice melting and lava flow \n  \nWe compare ice melting rates to the advance rate of a rhyolite lava body, to determine \nwhether rhyolite lava melts its way through the ice, or flows within pre-existing \ncavities. Hoskuldsson & Sparks (1997) estimated that ice would be melted at a rate of \n10-6 m s-1 during the emplacement of rhyolite lava lobes in a water-filled subglacial \ncavity. This slow melting rate is based on the rate of heat transfer during conductive \ncooling of the magma and the formation of a chilled rind (Allen 1980). Although \nmuch higher melting rates of 10-3 m s-1 were observed during the Gj\u00e1lp subglacial \nbasalt eruption, this is thought to indicate more rapid heat exchange caused by \nexplosive magma-water interaction (Gu\u00f0mundsson et al., 1997).  \n The effective viscosity of a 100 m-thick rhyolite lava flow with a chilled \ncarapace is likely to exceed the magma viscosity by 1.8-3.6 orders of magnitude \n(Manley 1992). Assuming that a similar rule applies to 5-20 m thick rhyolite bodies, \nand taking a magma viscosity of 106 Pa s, we calculate an effective lava flow \nviscosity of 108-109 Pa s. Using Jeffrey\u2019s equation for the flow of a viscous body on \nan inclined plane, \n \nwith magma density \u03c1 = 2.5 Mg m-3, acceleration due to gravity g = 9.8 m s-2, \nthickness of viscous body h  = 20 m, slope angle \u03b1 = 30\u00b0 and viscosity \u00b5 = 108 - 109 \nPa s, this gives a potential lava flow velocity of 10-3-10-2 m s-1. Therefore, for the \nBl\u00e1hn\u00fakur lava lobes, the potential lava flow velocity could have exceeded the ice \nmelting rate by 3 or 4 orders of magnitude, so the ice would have constrained the lava. \n Two independent observations from active volcanoes support this hypothesis. \nVinogradov & Murav\u2019ev (1988) observed that supraglacial meltwater runoff incised \nchannels in the glacier downslope of the vent during an eruption in Kamchatka, which \nformed a mould for an ensuing lava flow. Basaltic lava from Okmok volcano, Alaska \nwas diverted when it flowed against a glacier (Byers et al. 1947). Slower-flowing \nrhyolite lavas are likely to be similarly diverted by ice walls. The implication is that \nthe shape of lava bodies on Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur may record the shape of cavities present at the \nglacier base during the eruption.  \n \n \nEvidence for the morphology of subglacial cavities \n \n(a) from lava lobes \nThe joint patterns, morphologies and distribution of rhyolite lava lobes suggest that \nconical ice cavities were melted into the base of the glacier during this phase of the \n\u00b5\n\u03b1\u03c1\n3\n=\nsin2gh\nv\n 10 \neruption. From the sizes of the lava lobes, we infer that these cavities had roofs \nbetween 2 and 5 m high and were randomly distributed. There are three lines of \nevidence for magma-water interaction at lobe bases: perlitic alteration of obsidian, a \ngradational contact with breccia that contains blocky ash shards, and the presence of \nmatrix vesicles in the breccia. From this it is inferred that the cavities contained at \nleast some meltwater, although it is impossible to tell whether they were completely \nfilled. Such a subglacial cavity system has not been described in the glaciological \nliterature (e.g. Fountain & Walder 1998), and may reflect localised melting of the \nglacier base by convecting steam, possibly linked to lava lobe advance.  \n \n(b) from columnar jointed lavas \nLater in the eruption, it appears that much larger cavities had developed in the glacier \nbase: over 20 m high and 20 m wide. These had steeply inclined ice walls and may \nhave contained little meltwater ('open' conditions, Hooke 1984), as the lack of \nevidence for magma-water interaction suggests. Subglacial cavities of a similar size \nare thought to have carried meltwater away from the site of the 1996 Gj\u00e1lp eruption \n(Gu\u00f0mundsson et al., 1997).  \n \n \nPosition of the ice roof and eruptive mechanisms \n  \nInitially, the rate of outward growth of the edifice may have approximately matched \nthe rate of melting of the surrounding ice, thus maintaining the ice roof close to the \nvolcano. At this stage, lava lobes were emplaced in isolated ice cavities formed by \nlocalised melting of the glacier base (Fig. 10). Meanwhile, juvenile material was \nwashed down the volcano flanks and redeposited by meltwater in subglacial channels \n(Fig. 10). We speculate that a hiatus in the eruption then followed, during which the \nice roof receded significantly from the edifice (Fig. 11). Continued heat loss from \nnewly erupted material via steam transport of heat to the ice roof would have allowed \nthe subglacial cavities to enlarge without continuing to be filled with debris. As the \nice retreated, portions of lava lobe-breccia A were locally destabilised and cascaded \ndown the flanks, generating debris flow deposits (Fig. 10). After continued melting, a \nsubsequent pulse of magma would have encountered larger cavities, the ice roof now \nup to 20 m above the edifice. Lavas then flowed down the slope within these cavities \n(Fig. 10). \nObservations from a recent subglacial basalt eruption in Iceland support this \nmodel. Melting continued above the site of the 1998 Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn subglacial eruption \nfor weeks after the eruption had stopped, as the hyaloclastite pile slowly cooled (M. \nT. Gu\u00f0mundsson, pers. comm. 1999).  \n \nMeltwater drainage and hazard implications \n \nThe presence of (a) juvenile-rich subglacial meltwater stream deposits and (b) 'dry' \nsubglacial lava flows within the subglacial rhyolite sequence at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur suggests \nthat meltwater was able to drain away during the eruption. This is consistent with the \nmodel of Hoskuldsson & Sparks (1997), which predicted that positive volume \nchanges accompanying subglacial rhyolite eruptions would expel meltwater from the \nvent area. A basaltic eruption underneath thin ice (<150 m) may also be well drained \n(Smellie & Skilling, 1994). However, Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur was probably emplaced beneath a \nglacier >400 m thick, since the lithofacies suggest an entirely subglacial setting and \n 11 \nthe edifice is 350 m high. Thus we have strong evidence for basal leakage of \nmeltwater under a thick glacier (Smellie 1999).  \nThe lack of development of a subglacial lake at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur served to decrease the \nvolcanic hazards in two ways: (1) by limiting the volume of standing water available \nfor explosive magma-water interaction and (2) by restricting the intensity of any \nresultant j\u00f6kulhlaup.  \n \n \nConclusions \n \nField observations of the effusive subglacial rhyolite succession at Bl\u00e1hn\u00fakur have \nrevealed complex patterns of volcano-ice interaction. The ice roof was close to the \ngrowing edifice during the early stages of eruption, and lava lobes entered conical \ncavities melted in the glacier base. Only a minor volume of phreatomagmatic tephra \nwas generated, largely at lobe bases. As the ice roof melted back, lava lobes and \ntephra were destabilised and cascaded down the volcano flanks. A variety of deposits \nindicates that avalanching occurred both during and after emplacement of the lava \nlobes. During the eruption, heat from the subglacial deposits enlarged existing \nsubglacial cavities, forming moulds for subsequent lava flows that advanced and \nchilled against the ice walls. The presence or absence of water in the subglacial \ncavities appears to have controlled the eruption mechanisms. A complex feedback \nbetween the eruption rate, the ice melting rate and the eruption mechanisms resulted \nin the varied lithofacies architecture observed. Meltwater was able to drain away from \nthe vent area during the eruption, reducing the volcanic hazards.  \n \nAcknowledgements We thank G. Finnsdott\u00edr, B. Sigmarsdott\u00edr, F.
