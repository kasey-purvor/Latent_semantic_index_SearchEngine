Introduction \nThe by-product of uranium enrichment, where the fissile isotope 235U is artificially concentrated \nfor use as nuclear fuel or weapons, is depleted uranium (DU). In contrast to natural uranium, DU \ntypically comprises (2 \u2013 3) x10-3 235U\/238U, is also depleted in 234U, and is contaminated by \nanthropogenic 236U from reprocessed uranium (Bleise et al. 2003). Worldwide nuclear programmes \nhave amassed c. 1.2 million tonnes of DU, most of which is stored as UF6 (NEA & IAEA 2001). \nApplications for depleted uranium metal include ballast, munitions and radiation shielding. The use of \narmour piercing DU munitions (kinetic energy penetrators) in the Gulf and Balkans conflicts, and \nrecently the Iraq invasion has been highly controversial, because they disperse a radioactive and toxic \nmaterial into the environment. However, DU exposure is unlikely to present a significant health risk \n(e.g. Priest 2001). \nThe Royal Society (2001; 2002) reports focus on the health risks from inhalation of DU \nparticulates. The reports recommended that the environmental behaviour of alloys and particles of DU, \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 2 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N. S., Chenery, S. R. N. & Parrish, R. R. 2009. The distribution of depleted uranium \ncontamination in Colonie, NY, USA. Science of the Total Environment, 408 (2), 397-407. \nshould be compared to natural uranium minerals, and information should be obtained on their \nbioavailability. \nSeveral recent studies have investigated the environmental behaviour of DU metals, which \ncorrode in oxidising environments to form soluble uranyl species (e.g. Buck et al. 2004; Schimmack et \nal. 2005; Fomina et al. 2008; Handley-Sidhu et al. 2009). The DU particulates released from \nmunitions impacting armour are characterised in Krupka et al. (2009) and other papers in Health \nPhysics 96 (3) resulting from the Capstone Aerosols study (Parkhurst et al. 2004). These and the \nparticulates from the combustion of DU metals are introduced to the environment in a range of \noxidation states: UO2 \u2013 UO2+x \u2013 U3O8 \u2013 UO3. UO3 and uranyl species are thermodynamically \nfavoured, but bulk oxidation to these more soluble oxides is limited by slow kinetics and surface \npassivation (McEachern & Taylor 1998). This appears to be the case for the persistence of low \nsolubility UO2+x (hyperstoichiometric UO2) and U3O8 particles in soils (Chapter 3 \/ Lloyd et al. \n2009b). Radiogenic lead reduces the mobility of uranium from natural uraninite (e.g. Finch & Ewing \n1992), which otherwise is a logical analogue. Studies by Oliver et al. (e.g. 2008) have recently made \nenvironmental observations on the distribution of contamination from DU munitions test firing. A \nnumber of other studies have characterised individual particles from environmental samples \ncontaminated by the combustion of uranium metals and DU munitions (e.g. T\u00f6r\u00f6k et al. 2004; Salbu et \nal. 2005; Lind et al. 2009). \nThis aim of this environmental case-study is to identify the processes that affect the distribution \nand bioavailability of uranium from DU particulate contamination. The field site offers an accessible \nand large contamination footprint, with the absence of confounding contamination from DU metal \nfragments, and more than 25 years of environmental processing. It is therefore an attractive analogue \nfor battlefield contamination, and potentially for epidemiological studies related to DU particulate \ninhalation exposure. \nNatural uranium comprises three isotopes: 238U, 235U and 234U, all of which are unstable with \nlong half-lives. The \u2018convention\u2019 value for 235U\/238U (atom ratio, n235U\/n238U) is 7.253 x10-3 (Steiger & \nJa\u0308ger 1977), recently recommended as 7.257 x10-3 (De Laeter et al. 2003), with slight (\u2030) natural \nfractionation about this value (Weyer et al. 2008). Except for the Oklo natural reactors (Neuilly et al. \n1972) deviation of 235U\/238U implies anthropogenic contamination. Uranium in secular equilibrium has \na 234U\/238U ratio of 5.5 x10-5 (Richter et al. 1999), but there are significant natural deviations from this \nratio (e.g. Fleischer 2008). The abundance of 236U in natural uranium is negligible (e.g. Berkovits et al. \n2000). \nThe distribution of uranium within the Earth is discussed in Plant and Saunders (1996), the \ncontinental crust comprises an average 2.7 \u00b5g g-1 (Taylor 1964), hosted in resistate igneous accessory \nminerals including thorite, monzanite and zircon, and occasionally concentrated in ore minerals \nincluding uraninite and pitchblende (impure uranium oxides), and coffinite (a hydrated uranium \nsilicate). The natural background concentration is variable in environmental samples, typically low \u00b5g \ng-1 and ng g-1 levels. \nAs discussed previously, natural environmental samples comprise variable trace quantities of \nuranium, but anthropogenic contamination can be determined from 235U\/238U. Analytical methods for \ndetermining uranium in environmental samples were reviewed in Wolf (1999), the precision of \nradiometric techniques is often limited by the low activities of the uranium isotopes. Mass \nspectrometry techniques can achieve good precision, especially for isotope ratios. Isotope dilution \nthermal ionisation mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) offers the best precision, but is costly and requires \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 3 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N. S., Chenery, S. R. N. & Parrish, R. R. 2009. The distribution of depleted uranium \ncontamination in Colonie, NY, USA. Science of the Total Environment, 408 (2), 397-407. \nlaborious sample preparation. Taylor et al. (1998) obtained relative uncertainties of 0.2 % (k = 2) for \n235U\/238U from soil samples using single-spike ID-TIMS.  \nThe performance of four inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (ICP-MS, multi and \nsingle collector sector field, and quadrupole) in combinations with several nebulisers (ultrasonic and \ndesolvating), measuring 236U\/238U, are compared in Boulyga et al. (2002). The multicollector ICP-MS \n(MC-ICP-MS) achieved excellent precision; and the desolvating nebuliser reduced hydride \ninterference by up to two orders of magnitude. Quadrupole ICP-MS (ICP-QMS) instruments offer \nlower costs with generally good precision. As for most ICP techniques, sample dissolution is required. \nAnalyte separation chemistry is often preferred (e.g. Zheng & Yamada 2006), but it is desirable to \navoid this costly step. Other than hydride, there appears to be little potential for polyatomic \ninterferences on the uranium isotopes (Lariviere et al. 2006). Ehrlich et al. (2004) found analyte \nseparation to be unnecessary for 234U\/238U measurements from manganese nodules, although \ndeposition of dissolved solids on the sampler and skimmer cones could be an issue. However, \nGwiazda et al.  (2004) and Shen et al. (2002) experienced background interferences on m\/z 235 when \nworking at very low uranium concentrations; the latter study attributed this to organic rich samples \nand the interference was removed by separation chemistry. \nA significant objective of this case-study is to define the present distribution of DU \ncontamination. ICP-QMS was used for the determination of uranium isotope ratios from trace \nconcentrations in contaminated soil samples. Adequate precision was realised using a desolvating \nnebuliser, and without the need for analyte separation chemistry. There is heterogeneity in the isotopic \ncomposition of DU contaminant (Chapter 5 \/ Lloyd et al. 2009c) and the effect of this variability on \nthe isotopic compositions of bulk environmental samples is explored in this paper. The dataset \ndemonstrates the clarity for resolving DU contamination that precise 235U\/238U ratios coupled with \nhigh productivity offer. \n2. The Colonie case-study \n2.1. Site history \nNational Lead Industries (NLI) operated a factory in Colonie (NY, USA), from 1958 \u2013 1984. \nThe factory reduced UF4 to metal, and machined depleted uranium articles including kinetic energy \npenetrators, counterweights and radiation shielding (ATSDR 2004). The storage of scrap uranium \nmetal is hazardous, because this material is pyrophoric when it is finely divided. Therefore, this waste \nwas converted to uranium oxides in a furnace, which resulted in emissions of uranium oxide aerosols \nto the atmosphere. This was not contemporary best practice (Wilkinson 1962). National Lead were \nalso responsible for uranium contamination surrounding the Fernald site in Ohio (Buck et al. 1996). \nThe history of permits for the NLI site is documented in a draft report by the New York State \nDepartment of Health (1979). In 1968, it was noted that the converter stack operated without filtration, \nand immediately south of the site 238U soil concentrations of 163 \u00b5g g-1 were reported; Department of \nLabour permitted nearly 600 \u00b5g g-1 on site at that time. In 1973 NLI were permitted to discharge a \ntotal of 3.9 kg of uranium from 23 stacks. In 1975 the site was limited to handling natural and depleted \nuranium, but prior to this licences were also held for enriched uranium and thorium. In 1977, when \nproduction increased, an electrostatic precipitator was added to the conversion furnace (chip-burner), \nalthough this was reportedly bypassed (NYSDOH 1979; Romano 1982). \nIn May 1979 routine analysis of air filters, sampled at locations 40.8 and 15.7 km NNW of the \nNLI site, revealed contamination by micrometer diameter DU particles (Dietz 1980). A survey \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 4 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N. S., Chenery, S. R. N. & Parrish, R. R. 2009. The distribution of depleted uranium \ncontamination in Colonie, NY, USA. Science of the Total Environment, 408 (2), 397-407. \nconducted later that year revealed extensive depleted uranium contamination of soils surrounding the \nsite (Jeter & Eagleson 1980). The legal proceedings that led to the closure of NLI for excessive \nemissions of uranium to the environment are detailed in Romano (1982). \nIn 1984, US Department of Energy took over responsibility for the site, and since 1997 the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers has been responsible for the environmental remediation of the site under the \nFormerly Utilized Site Remedial Action Program (USACE 2009). The remediation threshold used for \nsoils is 35 pCi g-1 from 238U (USACE 2002), equivalent to 104 \u00b5g g-1, highly conservative when \ncompared to 190 pCi g-1 derived by Dunning (1996).  Remediation of the site and limited remediation \nof surrounding properties, involving removal and disposal of contaminated soils, is reported to have \ncost US$ 190 million (Dlouhy 2009). \nContamination is evident in reservoir sediments at a site downstream of NLI (Arnason & \nFletcher 2003; Lo et al. 2006; Arnason et al. 2008). Depleted uranium has been detected in the urine \nof former employees (with enriched uranium from one individual) and from some residents (Parrish et \nal. 2008). \nExamination of contaminated soils and dusts reveals primary uranium oxide particles in the size \nrange 0.5 \u2013 150 \u00b5m, including mixed UO2+x and U3O8 spheres with diameters 20 \u2013 64 \u00b5m, and rarely \nsecondary uranium precipitates (Chapter 3 \/ Lloyd et al. 2009b). These spheres and other specific \nparticle morphologies are directly comparable to those from munitions. Laser ablation (LA-) MC-ICP-\nMS reveals a spread of depleted uranium isotope ratios from individual particles, attributed to \nvariations in the NLI feedstocks (Chapter 5 \/ Lloyd et al. 2009c). \n2.2. Environmental setting \nThe NLI site is located between Colonie and Albany, NY, USA (Figure 1). The NLI site \nneighbours other industrial sites, and is close to two busy roads and a railway, the surrounding area \n(within 3 km) is mainly suburban with gentle topography. Construction of highway I90, State \nUniversity of New York (SUNY) Albany campus, and the Harriman Campus during the 1960s \nrelandscaped much of the area within a 2 km quadrant SW of NLI. \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 5 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N. S., Chenery, S. R. N. & Parrish, R. R. 2009. The distribution of depleted uranium \ncontamination in Colonie, NY, USA. Science of the Total Environment, 408 (2), 397-407. \n \nFigure 1. Location map for the NLI site, which is located between Colonie \nand Albany, NY, USA. Base map with permission (US Department of Commerce \n2001). \nThe soils within 3 km of NLI are dominated by generally well-drained loamy fine sands; with \nlittle pedogenic horizon development, less than 14 wt. % clay, acid pH and negligible carbonate \ncontent (USDA 2006). The soil samples collected for this study had a pH range of 3.2 \u2013 7.6, median \n5.3 (n = 208). There is typically a thin, < 1 cm, leaf litter layer covering a 15 \u2013 25 cm thick organic-\nrich mineral-sand horizon (A). These soils are derived from aeolian dune deposits (well sorted silica \nrich fine-sands), kame deposits, lacustrine sands and some clays, which overlie the Normanskill Shale \nof the Middle Ordovician (NYS Geological Survey 1999). The Colonie soils contain small quantities \nof detrital zircons, which host natural uranium. \nThe mean uranium concentration of 19 sediment samples from within 12 km of NLI, analysed \nby X-ray fluorescence for the NURE programme (USGS 2004), was 0.6 \u00b5g g-1. Uranium air \nconcentrations for air samples collected in Albany in 1969 were c. 0.5 ng m-3, or 5 \u00b5g g-1 of total \nsuspended particulate (concentrated relative to sediments), within the range of those reported from \nelsewhere in New York State (McEachern et al. 1971). \nVegetation in the area includes deciduous and coniferous woodlands, and the native Albany \nPine Bush ecosystem including pitch pine (Albany Pine Bush Preserve Commission 2005). The \nK\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate zone is Dfa, \u201ccold, without dry season, hot summer\u201d (Peel et al. 2007). \nIn addition to depleted uranium, the NLI site has also handled other hazardous materials \nincluding enriched uranium, thorium, heavy metals (including Pb, Ni, Sb and Cd) and polychlorinated \nbiphenyl (PCB) oils. Some of these materials were dumped into a lake that adjoined the NLI site \n(ATSDR 2004). A \u2018US Superfund\u2019 site, remediated for mercury and PCB oil contamination is located \napproximately 900 m WNW of NLI (EPA 1983). The Patroon creek, which runs parallel to highway \nI90 and into which NLI discharged waste water via a culvert, was previously classified as one of the \nten most severely polluted streams in New York State (refs. in Arnason & Fletcher 2003). \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 6 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N. S., Chenery, S. R. N. & Parrish, R. R. 2009. The distribution of depleted uranium \ncontamination in Colonie, NY, USA. Science of the Total Environment, 408 (2), 397-407. \n2.3. Background data \nIn 1979 NLI were required to commission a survey of soils surrounding the Colonie site. \nSurface soil samples (0 - 1.3 and 1.3 - 5.1 cm) from within 600 m of NLI were analysed by gamma-\nray spectrometry and reported in Jeter and Eagleson (1980). The gamma-ray spectrometry data have \npoor precisions, typically \u00b1 32 % for 235U\/234Th \u2248 235U\/238U. The 234Th activity data (\u00b1 14 %) have \nbeen converted to uranium concentrations, which have been interpolated by ordinary kriging using \nESRI Geostatistical Analyst (Johnston et al. 2001), and are presented in Figure 2. \n \nFigure 2. Ordinary kriging of 1979 soil survey data (log-transform, quadratic \ntrend removal, exponential semivariogram model; cross validation statistics: \nmean standardised error 0.004; RM2 standardised error 0.98). The distribution of \nuranium was clearly controlled by the prevailing winds. From this interpolated \ndataset, it is estimated that c. 3.2 tonnes of uranium contaminated the surface \n5.1 cm of soils within 600 m of NLI. Wind rose from Albany County Airport data, \n1961 - 1979 (WebMet.com 2002; Lakes 2005). \nThe areal distribution of uranium surrounding NLI was clearly controlled by the prevailing \nwinds; and can be attributed to aerial deposition of uranium particulate emissions. The total mass of \ncontaminant uranium in the surface soils, to a depth of 5.1 cm and a distance of 600 m from NLI, is \nestimated in the order of 3.2 tonnes 1 (from the integration of the interpolated dataset, with an \nestimated 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 g cm-3 dry unconsolidated soil density, and a mean natural background of 1 \u00b5g g-1 \nuranium). The natural background is determined in Section 5.2, and the mass beneath 5.1 cm is \nestimated in Section 5.3. \nTo place this in context, the natural uranium in this volume of soil is approximately 54 kg. The \nColonie contamination is significant compared to 321 tonnes DU deployed during the Gulf War \n(Bleise et al. 2003) of which a small fraction was aerosolised and spread over numerous locations. \n                                                   \n1\n It is difficult to calculate the uncertainty involved in this figure; it was estimated to be in the \norder of \u00b1 0.5 tonnes. \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 7 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N. S., Chenery, S. R. N. & Parrish, R. R. 2009. The distribution of depleted uranium \ncontamination in Colonie, NY, USA. Science of the Total Environment, 408 (2), 397-407. \nThese quantities are small compared to the emissions of heavy metals from large smelters, e.g. \nRawlins et al. (2006) estimated that 2500 tonnes of lead particulates contaminated Humberside (UK). \nThe NLI contamination footprint equates to an average 2 g m-2 deposition over the 1979 survey \narea, but is substantially concentrated towards the site. Approximately 49 % was deposited within 200 \nm of NLI, and 80 % within 400 m. Our previous estimate of 5 tonnes incorrectly assumed a higher soil \ndensity (Parrish et al. 2008). It is apparent that annual discharges of 3.9 kg permitted in 1973 were not \ntypical of the plant\u2019s history, averaging 139 kg per annum from 1958 \u2013 1981. \n3. Methodology \n3.1. Sampling \nSoil sampling was conducted during 2006 and 2007. Due to the limited number of easily \naccessible and apparently undisturbed sampling locations, it was not possible to follow a designed \nsampling strategy for this study, i.e. sampling had to be more ad hoc. Most of the sampling locations \nin this suburban environment were in wooded areas, scrubland and on public land. A number of areas \nare either less accessible, or they have been substantially re-landscaped during the 1960s, e.g. Albany \nInternational Airport, the Harriman Campus, University at Albany (SUNY), I90, and the more densely \npopulated neighbourhood south of I90 (see Figure 1). \nSoil samples were collected using a cleaned hand-auger, after removal of vegetation and leaf \nlitter from the soil surface. The top 5 cm was bagged separately to the remaining 5 \u2013 15 cm sample. \nThus, the samples are mainly organic rich loamy fine sands (A horizon). For each location, a sample \nwas collected from five points over a ten-metre square, totalling approximately 0.5 kg soil. Sampling \nduplicates were taken from approximately one in ten locations, from an offset square. Soil profiles \nwere sampled by digging a pit and collecting from a cleaned surface. \n3.2. Sample preparation and dissolution \nSoils samples were dried at 40 \u2013 60 \u00b0C for 24 - 72 hours, sieved to less than 2 mm, and split into \ntwo subsamples. A 60 g aliquot from each sample was ground to a fine powder in an agate ball mill \n(aiming for < 63 \u00b5m grain size). \nThe aim of the sample digestion methodology (after Green 2007) is for total dissolution. For \neach digestion, one gram of the powdered soil was weighed into an acid-leached PFA vessel \n(Savillex), 20 ml of concentrated HNO3 was added, the vessel sealed and refluxed at 120 \u00b0C for 8 \nhours, then opened and evaporated. 8 ml of HNO3, 4 ml HClO4 and 10 ml HF were added to each \nvessel, which was heated to 80 \u00b0C for 8 hours, before being evaporated to near-dryness at 160 \u00b0C. The \ncontents were dissolved in 10 ml 50 % HNO3 and 10 ml H2O2, and then diluted to 100 ml (i.e. 1 % soil \nin a 5 % HNO3 matrix). Prior to analysis, the solutions were diluted to 0.1 % or less in 1 % HNO3. \nTypical digestion blank levels are c. 4 ng uranium (using BDH Aristar analytical grade reagents and \nMilliQ 18 M \u2126 deionised water). \nPrior to MC-ICP-MS analysis, uranium was separated from a sub-set of the soil solutions. The \nsolutions were adjusted to 4M HNO3 (double quartz distilled), and then pipetted onto pre-leached \ndipentyl pentylphosphonate (Eichrom Industries UTEVA`, described Horwitz et al. 1992). The \nuranium was then eluted using 0.6 M HCl, this solution was evaporated to dryness, H2O2 was added \nand then evaporated, and finally dissolved in 1 ml 2% HNO3. Typical laboratory blanks for the \nseparation chemistry in the class 100 clean room are < 100 fg uranium. \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 8 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N. S., Chenery, S. R. N. & Parrish, R. R. 2009. The distribution of depleted uranium \ncontamination in Colonie, NY, USA. Science of the Total Environment, 408 (2), 397-407. \n3.3. Analytical \nThe diluted sample digests were analysed at the British Geological Survey (Keyworth, UK) \nusing ICP-QMS (VG Elemental Excell). Concentrations were determined in a separate run to the \nisotope ratios, using external multi-element standards (2, 5, 10 ng ml-1 concentration) and an internal \nRe monitor solution added by T-piece prior to nebulisation (concentric flow, 1 ml min-1). \nFor isotope ratio analysis, the sample digests were diluted to achieve 0.6 - 1 million counts per \nsecond from 238U on the ion counter (typically from 1 \u2013 4 ng ml-1 at 0.1 ml min-1). A desolvating \nnebuliser (Cetac Technologies Aridus II) was used for isotope ratio runs, to minimise hydride \ninterference and maximise sensitivity. Analytical runs were limited to about 60 sample solutions due \nto fouling of the Ni sampler and skimmer cones, which significantly reduced sensitivity. However, \nthese can be cleaned for less cost than analyte separation chemistry. \nNatural uranium solutions were used as external standards (US Geological Survey SDO-1 or \nInstitute for Reference Materials and Measurements REIMEP 18-A). The instrument was operated in \npeak jumping mode, acquiring 15 measures integrated from 920 sweeps across m\/z 233, 234, 235, 236 \n& 238, with dwell times of 5 milliseconds. Blank, hydride and mass-bias corrections were applied to \nthe data. In actuality the hydride correction from m\/z 236 \/ m\/z 235, typically c. 10-5, is convolved with \nabundance sensitivity from 238U peak tails (not measured), but is not significant to the reported data. \nThe mass bias, typically c. 0.3 % for 235U\/238U and assumed linear with mass, is the significant \ncorrection. Uncertainty (k = 2) was propagated from the instrumental standard error of the mean (n = \n15) and the relative standard deviations of the corrected QC solutions. \nA subset of the soil samples were analysed at the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory \n(Keyworth, UK) using MC-ICP-MS (VG Elemental Axiom) with a desolvating nebuliser (Cetac \nTechnologies Aridus), after separation of the analyte uranium from its matrix. Abundance sensitivity, \nhydride, and mass-bias were corrected for using an external standard (U950A, natural uranium \nsolution, assuming the convention value 235U\/238U 7.253 x10-3). \nTotal carbon was measured in triplicate from infrared absorption by combustion gases (LECO \nCS230, Stockport, UK). Soil pH was measured from unmilled soils using a calibrated Pt electrode in a \n1 g : 2.5 ml 0.01 M CaCl2 (aq) slurry. \nOrdinary kriging was used to interpolate the sample data using ESRI Geostatistical Analyst \n(Johnston et al. 2001). A log transform was used for heavily skewed datasets, and a quadratic function \nfor trend removal. The cross-validation error statistics were optimised by changing the semivariogram \nmodel, lag size, and \u2018neighbours included\u2019 parameters. Exponential semivariogram models and 8 \nsector \u2018neighbourhood searches\u2019 were appropriate because it was apparent from the data that \ncontamination falls off exponentially and is directional (see Section 5.5). Reasonable cross-validation \nerror statistics were achieved, and these are summarized with the methodology in the figure captions. \n4. Quality Control \n4.1. Uranium concentrations \nThe ICP-QMS concentration data for three quality control (QC) solutions are presented in Table \n1. Reference materials SDO-1 (U.S. Geological Survey, shale powder, c. 9.7 % organic carbon) and \nJR-2 (Geological Survey of Japan, rhyolite powder) were included in each digestion batch to monitor \ndissolution and analyte recovery. There is a slight, but minimal, positive bias for the independent \nmulti-element standard. SDO-1 was underestimated by c. 4 %; JR-2 was within the expected range. \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 9 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N. S., Chenery, S. R.

Uranium isotope ratios \nThe MSWD (Wendt & Carl 1991) of the 236U\/238U data from REIMEP 18-C suggested that the \npropagated uncertainties were underestimated, so these were expanded by 5 %. The lower limit of \ndetection (LLD) for 236U\/238U by ICP-QMS was estimated as 2 x10-6. \nThompson-Howarth duplicate quality control charts, suggested that 235U\/238U uncertainty was \nunderestimated using instrumental standard error; standard deviation appears more appropriate. This is \npossibly because for 236U and 234U, precision is limited by counting statistics, but plasma noise may be \nsignificant for 235U. \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 10 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N.

For 235U\/238U, all of the ICP-\nQMS ratios were well within uncertainty of the MC-ICP-MS. MC-ICP-MS achieving c. 2.5 times \nhigher measurement precision cf. ICP-QMS. For 234U\/238U, one in twenty was outside of uncertainty \n(appropriate for 95 % confidence interval), also without systematic bias. Of the seven 236U\/238U ratios \nquantified by ICP-QMS, there was a slight positive bias relative to the MC-ICP-MS data, but all were \nreported within uncertainty. \nSlightly higher 235U\/238U precision (1 %) was reported by Zheng and Yamada (2006) after \nanalyte separation chemistry. 232Th1H2 interference on 234U\/238U is highly unlikely to be an issue as \n235U1H was minimised by the desolvating nebuliser.

At least some of the scatter \ncan be accounted for by the heterogeneity of the particulate (data plotted from \nChapter 5 \/ Lloyd et al. 2009c). The \u2018average end-member\u2019 DU composition is \nestimated (2.05 \u00b1 0.06) x10-3 235U\/238U, (3.2 \u00b1 0.1) x10-5 236U\/238U (n = 405). The \nICP-QMS data are in agreement with the MC-ICP-MS. Two samples are \nhighlighted as examples of scatter from the mixing line, which are discussed \nfurther in the text. \nFigure 5 Inset. Plot of 234U\/238U against 235U\/238U; there is less scatter on \nthis mixing line (weighted, adj. R2 0.99). DU end-member estimated as (7.1 \u00b1 0.3) \nx10-6 234U\/238U; NU (5.60 \u00b1 0.06) x10-5. Lines mark secular equilibrium, the typical \nrange of natural fractionation in soils, 0.7 \u2013 1.2 (Szabo & Rosholt 1982), and 0.5 \nrecorded for a natural geological sample (Fleischer 2008). \nFigure 5 shows mixing lines between an average DU composition and natural uranium, there is \nno evidence for mixing with enriched uranium (which was also handled by NLI). The isotopic \ncompositions of the particulate contamination are heterogeneous, which is reflected in the scatter of \nthe bulk sample data from the mixing line (supported by MC-ICP-MS analyses). \nThe upper highlighted (duplicate) sample data deviate significantly from the line, requiring a \nhigh degree of \u2018selectivity\u2019 from the high 236U particle population. It is unlikely that this is from \nnugget effect. The location is on a small terrace of the stream that flows from the NLI site, and \nadjacent to an old rubbish tip on land cleared during the 1960\u2019s. It is possible that related ground \ndisturbance have masked earlier contamination, or that NLI liquid discharges were isotopically \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 13 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N.

The lower 236U data highlighted is also from disturbed ground, a filled depression that may \nhave received NLI wastes. \nThe lowest measured 235U\/238U ratio from a bulk sample was (2.06 \u00b1 0.02) x10-3, with a uranium \nconcentration of 220 \u00b1 19 \u00b5g g-1. From this concentration, the sample probably comprises greater than \n99 % DU of total uranium. The DU \u2018end-member\u2019 cannot be known precisely, and the particle data \nfrom Lloyd et al. (Chapter 5 \/ 2009c) show there were a variety of DU isotopic compositions used at \nNLI. The mean isotopic compositions of the particle data are (2.04 \u00b1 0.02) x10-3 for 235U\/238U, and (2.9 \n\u00b1 0.2) x10-5 for 236U\/238U, but these data may not be fully representative. For a 235U\/238U ratio of c. \n(2.05 \u00b1 0.06) x10-3, from a linear functional relationship of maximum likelihood (amc 2002a), the \n236U\/238U ratio is (3.2 \u00b1 0.1) x10-5. The \u2018average end-member\u2019 is similar to the mean of the particle \ndata. \nThe inset graph of 234U\/238U against 235U\/238U shows a well-defined mixing line between natural \nuranium and a depleted uranium end-member. There is less deviation from this mixing line, compared \nto 236U\/238U against 235U\/238U. 234U\/238U depletion is approximately equal to 235U\/238U depletion in an \nenrichment cascade, whereas 236U is from the introduction of variable quantities of reprocessed reactor \ntails to the cascade (Smith 1984). The estimated end-members comprise (5.60 \u00b1 0.05) x10-5 234U\/238U \nfor natural uranium and (7.1 \u00b1 0.3) x10-6 for depleted uranium. Eighteen uranium oxide particles from \nColonie have been individually analysed by MC-ICP-MS, with a mean 234U\/238U ratio of (7.3 \u00b1 0.1) \nx10-6, which is in close agreement with the present estimate (Chapter 6 \/ Lloyd et al. unpublished). \nThere is some evidence of increased scatter with respect to 234U\/238U at the natural uranium end, \nc. \u00b1 0.3 x10-5. The secular equilibrium of 234U\/238U is (5.50 \u00b1 0.02) x10-5 (Richter et al. 1999), but \nnatural isotopic fractionation can vary this value by at least 0.5 \u2013 14 times, therefore 234U is not a \nreliable indicator of anthropogenic contamination (Fleischer 2008). A \u2018typical\u2019 range for natural soils \nis given in (Szabo and Rosholt (1982), of 0.7 \u2013 1.2. Therefore, isolated 234U\/238U measurements of \nenvironmental samples with less than 58 % DU contamination of total U cannot be resolved from \nnatural. \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 14 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N.

Labels state distance and bearing of sampling location from NLI. \nProfiles in A \u2013 C are from woodland locations, with loamy fine sands similar \nto those previously described. The profile in D appears have been disturbed \n(proximal to I90); there is an apparent accumulation of DU contamination above a \nsilty layer at 41 cm depth, beneath this fluvial sediments. E & F are from made-\nground (sampled by hand auger, cross-contamination may account for the bump \nin F): the surface 90 cm comprises coke, sand and clay, beneath this are sands \u00b1 \nclay; contamination persists to depths greater than 1.1 m. \nIntegration of the fitted exponential curve can be used to estimate the total deposition at this \nlocation, approximately 0.9 \u00b1 0.2 g m-2. It is estimated that presently c. 45 % of the contamination is \nwithin the surface 5.1 cm (1979 survey interval), 82 % within the surface 15 cm (this study), and 99 % \nwithin 40 cm. It is therefore probable that the total mass of depleted uranium contamination was \nunderestimated. However, the vertical distribution of contamination has probably changed since 1979. \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 17 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N. S., Chenery, S. R. N. & Parrish, R. R. 2009. The distribution of depleted uranium \ncontamination in Colonie, NY, USA. Science of the Total Environment, 408 (2), 397-407. \nShort-term soil mixing is discussed in Kaste et al. (2007), and dispersion of contaminants can be \nmodelled by combinations of advection and diffusion and\/or decomposition of the organic horizon. \nThe advection term is from the downward flux of water through the soil surface, entraining dissolved, \ncomplexed and colloidal bound contaminant. An advection model would feature a pulse that had \nmigrated downward from surface. Diffusion transport appears to control the observed uranium \nconcentration depth profiles. \nBioturbation by deep burrowing (anecic) earthworms can be a significant mechanism for \nvertical transport of low-solubility and strongly sorbing contamination (M\u00fcller-Lemans & Van Dorp \n1996), vertical burrows were observed in some of these soil profiles (Figure 4, Appendix 3). \nEarthworms are also known to be tolerant of heavy metal contamination (e.g. Sizmur & Hodson \n2009), with a predicted no-effect concentration of at least 100 \u00b5g g-1 for uranium (Sheppard et al. \n2005). \nTotal carbon also decreases exponentially from surface, note the slight bump for pit 2 at 20 \u2013 25 \ncm where organic rich patches were observed (heterogeneity); there is also a bump in the uranium \ncurve. Oliver et al. (2008) observed similar trends for uranium and loss on ignition from firing range \nsoils, but concluded that there was no significance for a direct relationship from their data. Differences \nin these exponential rates could be accounted for by the decomposition of organic material. It is \npossible that particulate is being physically mixed with organic carbon, or that dissolved uranium \nspecies are binding with the organic carbon. \nWithin the pH range of Colonie soils, in oxidising near-surface waters, either solid schoepite \n(hydrated uranyl oxy-hydroxide) or dissolved uranyl (UO22+(aq)) are likely to be thermodynamically \nstable (Langmuir 1997). However, the Colonie soils are generally well-drained, and at least for \noxidation in air, kinetics and surface passivation may limit bulk oxidation beyond UO2+x (s) \n(McEachern & Taylor 1998), as appears to be the case for a few primary particles recovered from \nColonie soils (Chapter 3 \/ Lloyd et al. 2009b). Schoepite has a solubility three orders of magnitude \ngreater than UO2+x (Ragnarsdottir & Charlet 2000), therefore speciation is significant for contaminant \ntransport and bioaccessibility. \nThe majority of uranyl ions from the oxidative dissolution of UO2 will strongly adsorb to ferric \noxyhydroxides and organic matter in soils (Langmuir 1997); uranyl ions are rapidly removed from \nsolution by association with organic matter (Dong et al. 2006). Sequential extraction of firing range \nsoils shows an association of DU with the oxidisable \u2018organic\u2019 fraction (Oliver et al. 2008). However, \nit is not clear from the literature which extraction step would leach uranium oxide particulates or other \nuranium species. For both primary particulate (observed) and adsorbed uranyl species (expected), the \ncontamination is likely to be dispersed by physical mixing. \nThe source term for the Colonie contamination is emissions of uranium oxide particulate into \nthe atmosphere, settling by wet and dry deposition onto the soil surface from 1958 - 1984: a broad \npulse input of slightly shorter duration than has occurred since emissions ceased (emissions records \nare not available). Most of the NLI feedstock appears to have been sourced from Paducah gaseous \ndiffusion plant tails from 1967 \u2013 1969 (Chapter 6 \/ Lloyd et al. unpublished), and most of the \ncontamination from NLI appears to be from prior to 1979. Therefore, the period of significant input \ncan be narrowed to 1967 \u2013 1979. \nA crude approximation of the source term is an instantaneous plane of DU on the soil surface 35 \nyears before sampling. Contaminant concentration can then be modelled as a function of depth and \ntime using the following diffusion equation from Crank (1975). \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 18 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N. S., Chenery, S. R. N. & Parrish, R. R. 2009. The distribution of depleted uranium \ncontamination in Colonie, NY, USA. Science of the Total Environment, 408 (2), 397-407. \n \n4Dt\n2z\n -\ne\nDt\nM\n  C\npi\n=\n \nWhere C is the concentration of contaminant as a function of z, soil depth (cm), and t, time \n(years, a), M is the total mass of contaminant (\u00b5g) estimated by integrating the present concentration \nprofile. The coefficient of diffusion, D (cm2 a-1) can be estimated by least squares fitting to the sample \ndata. \nFor pit 1, a diffusion coefficient (D) of c. 1.4 cm2 a-1 is estimated, and if maintained, the surface \nsoil concentration will halve in approximately 125 years time (pedological half-life). The estimate for \nthe adjacent pit, pit 2, is 2.1 cm2 a-1, giving a sense of the uncertainty involved. For a distant pit, pit 7, \nwith approximately 0.07 \u00b1 0.05 g m-2 total contamination (M), 1.4 cm2 a-1 was estimated. From these \nmodels, the proportion of contamination beneath 5.1 cm in 1979 was approximately one third (27 \u2013 38 \n%), so it is likely that total contamination was c. 50 % greater than previously estimated, i.e. c. 4.8 \ntonnes 2. This simplified model does not reflect deposition of contamination on these soils over a \nperiod. \nThe diffusion coefficients are of a similar magnitude to that measured using 210Pb for a \nbioturbated temperate mineral soil by Kaste et al. (2007). A similar approach could help refine the \nmodel of the Colonie contamination. They are also within the range reported by Bunzl (2002) and \nSchuller et al. (1997). The mixing time derived for the A horizon of pit 1 is approximately 222 years, \nequating to a mass turnover of c. 0.6 kg m2 a-1, compatible with earthworm bioturbation rates from \ntemperate grasslands (summarised data in Bunnenberg & Taeschner 2000). Physical mixing by \nearthworms (bioturbation) can account for the redistribution of contamination and organic carbon \nwithin the A horizon, and the contaminant appears to have very limited mobility. It is likely that \nbioturbation by earthworms is dispersing contaminant from the soil surface, in the form of primary \nuranium oxide particulates and uranyl species that are adsorbed to organic matter. \nProfiles E & F (Figure 9) are from made-ground situated between NLI and the railway. In 2006, \nthese coarse, friable, coke-rich \u2018soils\u2019 (c. 25 - 50 wt. % loss on ignition) comprised uranium up to 500 \n\u00b1 40 \u00b5g g-1 (for Pb 1180 \u00b1 142, Cu 1386 \u00b1 166, Sn 279 \u00b1 34, Sb 27 \u00b1 3 \u00b5g g-1). Subsequently this area \nwas remediated by replacing some of the surface material with clean fill. These profiles were sampled \nby hand auger in 2007 (pit sampling was not possible). The top of profile E reflects replacement of the \nsurface with cleaner material. Profiles E & F show an exponential increase in 235U\/238U, but they do \nnot reach natural composition within the surface 1.1 m. \n5.4. Uranium contamination map (concentration) \nThe concentration data from shallow soils are plotted and interpolated in Figure 10. Uranium \nconcentrations greater than 12 \u00b5g g-1 were excluded from the interpolation, because these heavily skew \nthe dataset. The excluded data were mostly within 200 m of NLI and access to undisturbed sites within \nthe north of this area was difficult. This dataset does not significantly increase the estimate of total \nuranium emissions, which are concentrated within the area of the 1979 survey. Significantly elevated \nconcentrations (3.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5g g-1) are measured up to 1.9 km NNW of NLI, likely to comprise 31 \u2013 81 \n% contamination of total uranium. \nThe concentration of 238U (converted from activity) for surface soils on the railroad south of \nNLI in 1968 were reported as 163 \u00b5g g-1 (NYSDOH 1979), in 1979 up to 3080 \u00b1 65 (Jeter & Eagleson \n                                                   \n2\n The uncertainty on this figure was estimated to be in the order of \u00b1 1 tonne. \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 19 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N.

The representativity and comparability of the earlier measurement is not clear, but it suggests \nthat the majority of the contaminant uranium probably occurred during 1968-1979. Proximal locations, \nwithin 30 m of each other, comprised 458 \u00b1 16 \u00b5g g-1 in 1979, 500 \u00b1 40 \u00b5g g-1 in 2006, and then after \nenvironmental remediation in 2007, 7.9 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5g g-1. \n \nFigure 10.

The southern extent \nis poorly constrained, due to difficulty accessing undisturbed sites in this more \ndensely populated neighbourhood; Figure 2 (1979 survey extent circled) \nsuggests that the southward distribution is much less extensive than shown here. \nA sediment core from the labelled reservoir was previously analysed by Arnason \nand Fletcher (2003). \nA sediment core from the Patroon reservoir (labelled) was sampled and analysed by Arnason \nand Fletcher (2003), with mean and maximum uranium concentrations of 13 and 320 \u00b5g g-1. In \ncontrast, the surface soil concentration interpolated for this location is 3.6 \u00b1 2.9 \u00b5g g-1. This clearly \nshows that uranium accumulated in the reservoir sediment, either from runoff from the Patroon creek \nwatershed, or from direct discharges from the NLI site into the Patroon Creek (approximately 1.6 km \nupstream). Some of the reservoir sediment contaminant appears to be from U(VI) species (Arnason et \nal. 2008), implying at least some dissolution and reprecipitation. \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 20 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N.

The \nsouthern extent is poorly constrained, due to difficulty accessing undisturbed \nsites in this densely populated neighbourhood; Figure 2 suggests that the \nsouthward distribution is much less extensive than shown here. DU has been \ndetected in soils at least 5.1 km NNW of NLI (DU detection limit c. 7.06 x10-3 \n235U\/238U). Wind rose from Figure 2, approximate weather station location. \nTransect lines marked A and B are referred to in Figure 12. \nA map of 235U\/238U is presented in Figure 11, which reveals the extent of DU contamination. \nThe previously discussed surface sample, 1.9 km NNW of NLI comprises (3.34 \u00b1 0.06) x10-3 \n235U\/238U, 73 \u2013 76 % DU of total U (see Figure 6 inset). More than one third of the total uranium in a \nsurface soil sample from 5.1 km NNW of NLI is depleted uranium contamination. These maps \ndemonstrate the sensitivity and potential precision of 235U\/238U for defining the contamination \nfootprint. This approach could be used to assess the historic exposure potential of residents, a \nprerequisite for a proposed health study in the Colonie area.

Differences in the exponential rates \ncan be attributed to wind speed frequency distributions for each direction (see \nFigure 11 for wind rose). \nFigure 12 plots sample data from two transects crossing NLI (as marked on Figure 11). Transect \nB roughly follows the primary axis of deposition, transect A is at a divergent angle to this. The isotope \nratios increase towards natural with distance from NLI, following exponential trends. This is typical of \npoint-source atmospheric pollutant dispersal (e.g. De Caritat et al. 1997). The differences in \nexponential rate can be attributed to differences in wind speed frequency distributions for each \ndirection; winds blowing towards 350 \u00b1 5 \u00ba occurred 6.4 % of the time, towards 120 \u00b1 5 \u00ba for 4.5 % of \nthe time, 300 \u00b1 5 \u00ba for 5.1 % but at lower speeds. \nThe typical detection limit for DU of 7.06 x10-3 235U\/238U is equivalent to 4 % DU of total U, \n0.05 \u00b5g g-1 DU with 1 \u00b5g g-1 NU, or one 84 \u00b5m diameter DU dioxide particle in a 60 g aliquot of \ntypical Colonie soil. Therefore, there could be potential for nugget effect during sub-sampling prior to \nmilling. However, the aerodynamic diameter of such a particle is large, and dry deposition is likely \nwithin 100 m of NLI (if initially convected to 20 m above surface and transported by a high wind at 11 \nm s-1) where surface soil DU concentrations are much higher. \nDU contamination has been detected to at least 5.6 km WNW of NLI (against prevailing wind), \n(7.03 \u00b1 0.04) x10-3 235U\/238U (n = 4). Approximately 42 ng of DU contaminates each gram of soil, \nequivalent to approximately 45 DU dioxide particles of 6 \u00b5m diameter (plausible for air transport at a \nmore usual 3 m s-1) are required to \u2018contaminate\u2019 each gram of sample. Winds favourable for transport \nto that location were rare, occurring only 0.5 % of the time. This area of the Pine Bush Preserve had \nrecently been affected by a fire, and it is possible that this concentrated contamination from the \ncombusted vegetation onto the soil surface. \n6. Conclusions \nThe Colonie case-study has been suggested as a reasonable analogue for battlefield \ncontamination by depleted uranium.  In this paper, uranium isotope ratios measured by ICP-QMS have \nrevealed the extent and spatial distribution of DU contamination surrounding the former NLI site. The \nmass of DU contamination surrounding NLI, within the surface 5.1 cm soils in 1979 was \nLloyd et al. 2009 The distribution of DU contamination in Colonie Page 22 of 26 \n \nLloyd, N.

This is significant within the \ncontext of emissions from battlefield deployment of DU munitions. \nThe quality control data show that accurate isotope ratios can be reliably measured by ICP-\nQMS without the need for costly separation chemistry. Multi-isotope ratio plots resolve heterogeneity \nof the DU compositions previously observed from individual particle analyses. There is no evidence of \nenriched uranium in the bulk soil samples. \nDU contamination can be detected in surface soils to at least 5.6 km from the NLI site using \n235U\/238U. With further sampling and analyses, the northward contamination plume could be mapped \nin detail using this method. This would be useful for constraining the historic exposure potential of \nresidents for proposed health studies in the Colonie area. \nIsotope ratio and concentration data allow the natural background range of uranium \nconcentration in Colonie soils to be estimated, 0.7 \u2013 2.1 \u00b5g g-1 with a weighted geometric mean of 1.05 \n\u00b1 0.06 \u00b5g g-1. The areal distribution of contamination was clearly controlled by prevailing winds.   \nThe vertical distribution of DU contamination is closely related to the carbon content in the \nsurface soil horizon, and can be explained by diffusion-like physical mixing. It is likely that \nbioturbation by earthworms is dispersing this low mobility contaminant from the soil surface, in the \nform of primary uranium oxide particulates and uranyl species that are adsorbed to organic matter. \nAcknowledgments \nThis study was sponsored by the British Geological Survey and the NERC Isotope Geosciences \nLaboratory (NIGL).
