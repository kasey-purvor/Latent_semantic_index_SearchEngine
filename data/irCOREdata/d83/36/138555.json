In terms of cost, they\nrepresent approximately 20% of total logistics costs (ELA\/AT Kearney, 2004 and\nEstablish\/Davis, 2005), whilst in terms of service they are critical to the achievement\nof customer service levels (Frazelle, 2001), particularly as distribution centres are\noften the final point in the supply chain for order assembly, value added services and\ndespatch to the customer. Automation is reasonably commonplace in large\nwarehouses, particularly with regard to conveyor \/ sortation, and automated storage\nand retrieval systems, with each of these types of equipment being present in more\nthan a third of large warehouses (Baker, 2004a). However, in spite of this\nsignificance in supply chains, warehouse automation has received relatively little\nresearch attention and this paper sets out to review the literature in this area and to\nexplore the reasons for automation, how companies undertake automation projects,\nand the factors that may be relevant in their successful implementation.\nWarehouse automation has been defined as \u201cThe direct control of handling\nequipment producing movement and storage of loads without the need for operators\nor drivers\u201d (Rowley, 2000, p. 38) and this is the definition used in this paper. The\nterm warehouse automation therefore includes equipment such as automated storage\nand retrieval systems (AS\/RS), automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and conveyorised\n2sortation systems, but excludes technology where warehouse operators are still\nnecessary (such as warehouse management systems per se and radio data terminals).\nWarehouse automation\nWarehouses perform a number of different roles in supply chains as identified by\nHigginson and Bookbinder (2005), namely as:\n\uf0b7 Make-bulk \/ break-bulk consolidation centres\n\uf0b7 Cross-docks\n\uf0b7 Transshipment facilities\n\uf0b7 Assembly facilities\n\uf0b7 Product-fulfilment centres\n\uf0b7 Returned good depots\n\uf0b7 Centres for miscellaneous activities, such as repairs and factory-outlet\nA report by Maltz and DeHoratius (2004) indicates that the trend is towards more\nadded value services and cross-docking activities. Whilst this trend may be\ndiscernible generally, survey results in the UK suggest that value added services,\nwhilst widespread, are fairly minor in nature and that cross-docking only applies to a\nminority of the throughput of large distribution centres (Baker, 2004b).\nSome insight into these trends can be discerned from the sales of automated\nmaterials handling equipment, which have been growing steadily in recent years. The\nreasons for this general sales growth include potential improvements in productivity,\norder accuracy, reduced space requirements, increased volume capacity, control of\n3inventory and increased customer service (Adams et al, 1996). In 2000, European\nsales amounted to approximately US$2 billion and are expected to grow at a rate of\n3.2% per annum (Frost & Sullivan, 2001). Within this overall sales increase, it is\ninteresting to note that storage equipment such as automated storage and retrieval\nsystems (AS\/RS) are expected to continue to experience the most rapid growth.\nCarousels and robotic devices are also expected to grow at above average rates, with\nconveyor systems maintaining their share of the market. Overhead conveyor systems\nand automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are expected to lose market share, with\ngrowth expected at or just above the general level of inflation. This overall growth\ntrend is supported by global figures that have been published showing that the average\nsales increase for the top 20 materials handling system suppliers increased by 4% in\n2003 and by 15% in 2004 (Modern Materials Handling, 2004 & 2005).\nWhilst this growth in automation is occurring, there is also a need for supply\nchains to become more agile so as to serve rapidly changing markets. Many market\nplaces are now highly volatile and demand is difficult to predict (Christopher &\nTowill, 2002). Under these conditions, the focus of supply chain management is\nshifting towards service, and in particular responsiveness, as the market winner\n(Mason-Jones et al, 2000). In terms of warehouse design, this may mean that such\n\u201clean\u201d principles as maximising space and equipment utilisation may be less\nimportant than providing high service levels to the customer. The latter aim may well\ninvolve pieces of equipment normally working at much lower levels than their\ncapacity throughput limit so that they can cope immediately with demand peaks.\n4There is potential scope for automation in various aspects of warehouses serving\nvolatile markets. For example, A-frame dispensers, pick-to-light systems, conveyors\nand sortation systems are all listed as examples of appropriate equipment for e-\nfulfilment centres (Tarn et al, 2003). Whilst these may be suitable in certain\ncircumstances, there have been concerns expressed in the trade literature as to\nwhether automation can be sufficiently flexible to meet changing market requirements\n(for example, Mathews, 2001 and Allen, 2003). These concerns have centred on\npossible changes in throughputs and product profiles during the life of the equipment.\nThe inability to respond to demand variations has been supported by Kamarainen &\nPunakivi (2002), who highlighted the inflexible capacity issues associated with such\nsystems in the e-grocery market. In that study, over-investment in picking automation\nwas identified as a main weakness of the business models employed. On the other\nhand, research by Fernie et al (2000) has indicated that automated sortation systems\nare being developed by retailers to accommodate the picking of case quantities. This\nuse of automation appears to be more viable for established retailers where demand\ncan be predicted with more confidence. This is supported by Rushton et al (2000)\nwho state that \u201chigh-tech\u201d installations should be based on some assurance of long-\nterm demand for the products handled. The provision of overcapacity to handle peak\ndemands thus needs to be part of a costed marketing and supply chain plan.\nWithin the concept of agility, automation is viewed as having an important role in\na number of activities. For example automated sortation equipment may offer the\npossibility of stockless distribution centres operated on a true cross-docking principle\n(Harrison & van Hoek, 2002). This concept can be extended to incorporate\nproduction postponement and value-added services, whereby conveyor and sortation\n5equipment may be used in a cross-docking facility to direct goods to warehouse areas\nwhere such activities as labelling, kitting and hanging may take place, without the\ngoods ever being placed into storage (Marvick & White, 1998). Automation may also\nbe viewed as offering the flexibility to handle peak throughputs at short notice,\nparticularly in areas where staff availability is a problem or in operations where the\nuse of additional staffing may result in congestion and productivity issues (Naish &\nBaker, 2004).\nWhilst responsiveness may be viewed as the market winner in unpredictable\nmarkets, cost is still important as a market qualifier (Christopher & Towill, 2000). In\nmore stable markets, cost may in fact be the market winner (Mason-Jones et al, 2000).\nWith regards to cost, warehouse automation is often viewed as being cost effective in\nlarge volume situations (Rowley, 2000). However, this has been questioned by some\nresearch (Hackman et al, 2001), which found that warehouses using higher levels of\nautomation tend to be less efficient. This association was partially mitigated by size\nin that this relationship was not so pronounced in large warehouses. Possible reasons\ngiven were inappropriate selection of system types, lack of adequate system\nmaintenance and the difficulty of reconfiguring to changing business requirements.\nThe first two reasons are associated with implementation procedures and ongoing\nmanagement, whilst the last reason is associated with agility. Research into picking\nautomation reached similar conclusions finding that the productivity gained by\nmechanisation is sufficient only to offset the higher operating costs that result from\nthe increased complexity of larger warehouses (Pfohl et al, 1992). The main benefit\nof automation may thus be achieved in the wider supply chain (e.g. by the\n6centralisation of inventory), with automation playing a key role in facilitating this by\ncontaining costs in the resultant large distribution centres.\nPrevious research into the reasons for automation has indicated that service and\ncost benefits are both sought by end users (Dadzie & Johnston, 1991). The major\nmotivations identified were to reduce material handling in the warehouse, increase\naccuracy levels, improve service consistency and increase speed of service, whilst the\nmain decision criteria were found to be reduction in labour cost, increase in output\nrate and improvement in service availability.\nHowever, it appears that warehouse automation projects may adversely affect\nservice levels in the short term, with \u201cburn-in\u201d difficulties being experienced\n(Hackman et al, 2001) leading to a \u201cservice level dip\u201d (Naish & Baker, 2004). This is\noften due to the need for substantial testing, commissioning and \u201csnagging\u201d (i.e. the\nrectification of faults) of automated equipment. Responsiveness can be severely\naffected during this early period. There have been a number of high profile instances\nof difficulties with the implementation of automated warehouse projects and some of\nthese have led to profit warnings in blue-chip companies (Emmett, 2005).\nThe reasons for the difficulties encountered in some warehouse automation\nprojects are not clear. Drury & Falconer (2003) highlight that such projects are\nnormally very complex, involving a number of different systems that need to be\ndesigned and developed in parallel, including the equipment itself, the software and\nthe building in which it will be housed. Naish & Baker (2004) also stress the\n7importance of these interfaces, whilst emphasizing the need for realistic timescales for\nthe overall project.\nThe decision to automate is viewed as an early decision within the warehouse\ndesign process by Rouwenhorst et al (2000) i.e. being a \u201cstrategic\u201d decision that will\nhave a long-term impact on the facility. Step-by-step warehouse design processes,\nbased on business requirements and data analysis leading to the decision as to whether\nto automate, are described in Rushton et al (2000) and Rowley (2000). Interestingly,\nonly the latter includes a specific step on examining flexibility issues (i.e. \u201csimulation\nof the proposed warehouse with different volumes\u201d, p.4) and this is the final step in\nthe process.\nOverall, there are some conflicting findings on the effectiveness of warehouse\nautomation in terms of both responsiveness and cost. In order to understand how\nwarehouse automation may, or may not, aid the provision of agility in a cost effective\nmanner, there is a need for further research in this area. The purpose of this paper is\nto explore the reasons for, and nature of, warehouse automation implementations in\norder to assist this understanding. In particular, the research described below sets out\nto explore:\n- why companies automate and the concerns that they may have in doing so: to\ncompare with the reasons given in the literature (e.g. Adams et al, 1996) and\nto update the research undertaken 15 years ago in the USA by Dadzie &\nJohnston (1991);\n8- how companies automate and how long such implementation projects take: to\nexplore this area, for example in relation to the normal steps described for\nwarehouse design (as per Rouwenhurst et al, 2000, Rowley, 2000, and\nRushton et al, 2000);\n- why certain projects were successful, and others not, in terms of successfully\nmaintaining the ongoing operations and keeping to time and cost budgets: to\ndevelop understanding in this area.\nBy exploring these questions, it is intended to provide a better understanding of\nthe role of warehouse automation within supply chains, particularly in the light of\nconcerns expressed about the potential impact on customer service levels and longer\nterm flexibility.\nResearch Method\nThe research was undertaken in two parts. The first part comprised semi-structured\ninterviews with eight companies in order to understand the main steps and issues\ninvolved in warehouse automation projects. These companies were selected to\nprovide the viewpoints of a number of stakeholders in such projects, namely four\nconsultancy firms, two materials handling systems suppliers, and two end user\ncompanies.\nThese interviews, together with the relevant literature, were then used to compile a\nsurvey questionnaire. This questionnaire was sent out to members of the Warehouse\n9and Materials Handling Forum of The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport\n(UK), who facilitated this survey. The members were selected on the basis of those\nwho had previously indicated that they would support a study of this nature. A total\nof 32 questionnaires were sent out by post and 19 useable responses were received.\nThis represented a response rate of about 60%. The survey questionnaires were\nfollowed up by telephone where information was missing or where any clarification\nwas needed of the responses. A number of the responses covered more than one\nproject and, in total, information was obtained on 27 warehouse automation projects.\nAlthough this is a small sample in terms of the quantitative analysis that can be\nundertaken, it is not an insignificant number in terms of warehouse automation\nprojects. Precise information in this regard is difficult to assess, but, as an indication,\nthe UK warehouse automation market has been estimated to be worth approximately\n\u00a3254 million in 2000 (Frost & Sullivan, 2001). On contacting one automation\ncompany, an average value per project was given as \u00a33.9 million. This would mean\nthat the sample represents approximately 5 months of the UK spend on warehouse\nautomation. Viewed another way, as most of the projects were completed within\nabout 4 to 5 years of the survey, the sample would therefore be in the region of 10%.\nThis is a very approximate estimate but provides an indication of the relevance of the\nsample. Owing to the relatively small absolute numbers in the sample, descriptions\nand comments were also requested from the respondents to provide a qualitative\ninsight into their decisions and views.\nThe respondents were from a range of sectors and held various positions, as set\nout in Table I. All of the respondents were involved in different projects.\n10\n[Take in Table I]\nSome of the consultancy firms supplied more than one questionnaire response,\ngiving the total of 27 separate warehouse automation projects for which information\nwas obtained. These projects covered a range of industries as set out in Table II.\n[Take in Table II]\nMany of the projects were in new buildings (13 projects), some were new\nautomation projects within existing buildings or extensions (12 projects), and the\nremainder were modification projects to existing automated equipment (2 projects).\nThe types of automation comprised storage (included in 17 projects), material\nmovement (11), sortation (10), order picking (9) and unloading \/ loading systems (5).\nMany projects included a number of these different aspects.\nThe initial interviews with consultants, materials handling suppliers and end users\nprovided the generic steps of warehouse automation projects. These steps may be\ngrouped into pre-project, implementation and post-project phases, as set out in Figure\n1.\n[Take in Figure 1]\n11\nThe pre-project phase includes the design steps up to the point of obtaining Board\napproval for the capital sums involved and formal agreement to proceed with the\nproject. The steps undertaken by the interviewees were broadly in line with the\ndesign methods described by Rouwenhurst et al (2000), Rowley (2000), and Rushton\net al (2000).\nThe implementation phase then starts with forming the project team and setting in\nplace all of the budgetary and control procedures. This phase includes the purchasing\nand manufacturing of the equipment, any building works, software development and\nfull installation, testing and commissioning, up to the point of \u201cgoing live\u201d (i.e. when\nthe equipment is first used operationally). Normally, the supplier was selected by\ntender during this phase, although sometimes the supplier (or systems integrator) was\nselected at the pre-project stage and the whole project developed with them.\nThe post-project phase includes the build-up of throughput to full capacity and the\nelimination of all faults, leading to final acceptance by the client (often payment is\nstaged, so that this final acceptance would trigger the final payment for the\nequipment). Subsequently, a follow-up evaluation may be conducted to ensure that\nthe equipment is still working to specification and to identify any modifications that\nmay be required as a result of changes to such factors as throughputs, product sizes\nand order characteristics.\nThe three phases formed the basis of the questionnaire structure, with the research\nquestions being drawn from key issues highlighted during these steps. The\nquestionnaire was ten pages long, and was set out as follows:\n12\n\uf0a7 General information about the company and project (6 questions);\n\uf0a7 Decision factors (6 questions);\n\uf0a7 Pre-project stage (5 questions);\n\uf0a7 Implementation stage (18 questions);\n\uf0a7 Post project stage (12 questions).\nMost of the questions were set out in tick box format, but, where appropriate,\nspaces were left for respondents to write their answers (for example, their views on\nthe main lessons learned from the project).\nResults\nReasons for automation\nIn the pre-project phase, the questionnaire explored why companies automate and\nwhat concerns they may have with automation.\nThe prime factor that brought about the need for automation was the requirement\nto accommodate growth, as shown in Table III. There was thus a business need in\nterms of capacity and it was decided by the respondents that automation was the best\nway to meet this need. For example, one respondent stated that the reason for\nautomation was \u201cto prolong the operational life of a distribution centre, thereby\ndelaying the need to close\u201d. The next two factors, those of cost and service, indicate\nthat companies believe that automation can, in the correct circumstances, meet both of\nthese potential \u201cmarket winning\u201d criteria. The fourth factor, that of reducing staffing\n13\nlevels, may be driven by a number of factors, such as productivity, head-count,\nindustrial relations or staff availability. The latter was mentioned during a number of\nthe initial interviews as an issue at key distribution centre sites in the UK.\n[Take in Table III]\nThese results shed new light on the findings of the Dadzie and Johnston (1991)\nsurvey, in which the accommodation of growth did not feature as a motivation for\nautomation. Reduction in materials handling, increased accuracy, improved speed,\nand improved consistency of service were the four motivations given in that survey.\nHowever, the statement \u201cAbility to increase output rate\u201d was agreed, or strongly\nagreed, with by 95.2% of the respondents in that study as one of the \u201ccriteria used in\nthe decision to automate\u201d, and therefore the motivation may have been relevant at that\ntime, even though the survey questions did not bring it out as a key factor. Both\nstudies do appear to support both cost and service reasons for automation.\nConcerns\nStaffing issues were considered to be very important as regards the change in culture\nthat may be associated with automation (see Table IV). For example, one company\nrecognised that there was a need to \u201cfully involve the whole workforce in testing and\npreparing procedures\u201d so that there would be \u201cownership\u201d of the automation project.\nInterestingly, a further concern was the fear of the technology not working, in spite of\nthe maturity of most automated systems. On the cost side, there was a concern about\nthe high capital investment involved, whilst on the service side there was some\n14\nanxiety about the lack of flexibility. The fear of a service level dip was recorded for\njust three projects, and this aspect is examined further later in this paper.\n[Take in Table IV]\nHow companies automate\nProjects normally have a Project Manager (who is responsible for the operation of the\nproject on a day-to-day basis) and a Project Sponsor (who is responsible to the\ncompany\u2019s senior executives for the successful outcome of the project). Most of the\nwarehouse automation projects in the survey were sponsored at Director level,\nindicating that they were regarded as major projects by the companies. This is in line\nwith the success criteria identified for other major supply chain projects, such as\nmajor information technology implementations (Favilla & Fearne, 2005). Most of the\nprojects were sponsored by the Logistics or Distribution Director, whilst four were\nsponsored by the Managing Director, as shown in Table V. This level of sponsorship\nmatches the investment and service level importance, as well as the cross-functional\nnature of the projects, mentioned in the literature.\n[Take in Table V]\nThe high-level design of the project is set out in the operational specification.\nThis document normally includes outlines of the automated equipment, buildings,\nlayout, software requirements, operational processes, manual interfaces, maintenance\nregimes and capital \/ operating costs. The operational specification of the projects\n15\nsurveyed was normally completed by a combination of in-house staff together with an\nequipment supplier, consultancy firm and\/or a systems integrator (i.e. a company that\ntakes prime responsibility on the contract for providing a working system that may\ninvolve a number of different equipment suppliers). Sometimes, all of these types of\ncompany were included in the team. The in-house staff were normally drawn from a\nrange of functions, including logistics planning, operations and information\ntechnology (IT) departments. Occasionally, a third party logistics provider (3PL) was\nalso part of the team, as set out in Figure 2.\n[Take in Figure 2]\nA formal tender procedure was used in 22 out of the 25 projects (for which\nanswers were received for this question), with the tender being sent out to an average\nof 3 to 4 suppliers (2 suppliers being the minimum number recorded and 8 suppliers\nthe maximum). These respondents were asked to list their key selection criteria (see\nTable VI). A wide range of criteria was used, with cost and experience being the two\nmost common.\n[Take in Table VI]\nParticularly for complex projects, the equipment suppliers and systems integrators\nwho were interviewed expressed the view that they could bring much more added\nvalue to the project by working with clients from the outset in developing a solution\nwith them, but this approach only seemed to be used in two of the projects. They also\nmentioned their preferred approach of responding to performance requirements, rather\n16\nthan to tenders that specified particular equipment in detail, as this reduced their scope\nfor innovation. This was not explored within this survey, but could be part of a\nfurther exploration of what constitutes a successful project.\nWarehouse automation projects tend to be complex by nature and, therefore,\nappropriate for computer simulation. Such simulation can be used to test the\noperation and identify potential bottlenecks (Vega, 2004), as well as simulating how\nthe operation would continue to operate in the case of breakdowns (e.g. to assess the\nimpact of one stacker crane failing in an AS\/RS installation). In the projects\nsurveyed, computer simulation was used in 7 of the projects at the pre-project stage\nand 11 during the implementation phase. In total, simulation was used in 13 of the 23\nprojects for which answers were received. The simulation tended to be used to\nexamine particular aspects of the operation. For example, one respondent stated that\nsimulation was used \u201cas part of the debugging exercise after implementation\u201d.\nTo summarise the way that companies automate, they are typically sponsored at\ndirector level, involve multi-disciplinary and multi-company teams, utilise formal\ntender procedures, select suppliers based on a range of selection criteria, and often\nsupport the design with the use of computer simulation tools. Warehouse automation\nprojects are thus generally set up and run as major projects within the companies.\nProject timescales\nThe project length was defined in the survey as from the start of planning for the\nproject to the project going live. This averaged 20 months, with a range from 5\n17\nmonths for the shortest to 39 months for the longest project. The overall profile is\nshown in Figure 3. These timescales were generally within the anticipated lengths of\nthe projects, with 22 of the projects being reported as on time, and 2 being late. The\nprojects were thus generally well planned and controlled, and this appears to be\nsupported by the corresponding cost responses, with 21 of projects being reported as\nwithin budget, and 2 as over budget.\n[Take in Figure 3]\nAfter the \u201cgo live\u201d date, there is normally a build-up period to the full operation of\nthe warehouse. For example, different product groups or geographical areas may be\nallocated to the warehouse gradually so as to minimise any disruption to service. The\naverage build-up periods of the respondents was 3 months, with the range being from\nan immediate \u201cbig bang\u201d approach to a build-up of over one year. The approach\ntaken was normally a balance between realising the benefits quickly (for example, by\nimproving pay-back periods by releasing other assets quickly) and mitigating the\npossible risks involved with becoming fully operational too quickly.\nThese figures give an average overall time-span from inception of the project to\nfull operation of nearly two years. This is a fairly lengthy time period for many\ncompanies to plan ahead, particularly when the pay-back after this may be in the order\nof 3 to 10 years (Emmett, 2005).\nThe impact of the projects on the ongoing operations\n18\nThere is some concern in the literature concerning the impact of automation projects\non the ongoing operation and, in fact, only 5 out of 24 projects involved no disruption\nto operations (NB this question was not relevant for projects relating to new\noperations). Whilst 11 of the implementations involved \u201cminimal\u201d disruption, 8\nsuffered from \u201cmoderate or extensive\u201d disruption (as shown in Figure 4). These\nfindings appear to justify the concern about the technology not working, at least in the\nshort-term. Whilst most automated equipment types have been in existence for many\nyears now and are therefore fairly mature, the complexity of the projects normally\ninvolves numerous testing and commissioning problems. Although these are\nnormally resolved, there can be a period when service levels suffer before the\ndesigned benefits are achieved.\n[Take in Figure 4]\nThe way in which the disruption is manifested can be wide ranging. For example,\none respondent described the situation as follows: \u201ca failure to process orders,\nexcessive labour hours, and first time order fill reduced to unacceptable levels\u201d.\nThe main reasons for disruption are shown in Table VII, with the IT system being\nthe most common reason cited, followed by installation of the automated equipment.\nBuilding construction, people factors and the difficulties associated with consolidating\na number of sites are amongst the other reasons quoted. These reasons demonstrate\nthe different facets of automation projects and, hence, the complexity of the projects.\nThe successful outcome of the projects may be affected by delays or problems in any\none of these areas, as well as in the interface areas between them. For example, the\n19\ninstallation of sprinkler pipes requires co-ordination between the building and storage\nequipment aspects, whilst the reading of bar codes needs co-ordination between\nsortation equipment and the control software. One respondent commented that \u201cco-\nordinating the different streams can be difficult and result in phasing issues\u201d.\n[Take in Table VII]\nOne reason for the IT system being such a critical part of the project is the extent\nof the IT changes that are normally involved with warehouse automation projects, as\nshown in Figure 5. In addition to most projects involving new equipment control\nsystems, almost half the projects involved new warehouse management systems\n(WMS) and most involved at least modifications to the company\u2019s transaction\nsystems (e.g. Enterprise Resource Planning or legacy systems). Interfacing across\nthese various systems can be a major issue in terms of complexity, time and cost\n(Higginson & Bookbinder, 2005). The software development time was often cited in\nthe interviews as the critical path in automation projects.\n[Take in Figure 5]\nThe extent of the effort that may be required in the information technology area is\ndemonstrated by one response that related to an implementation that suffered only\nminimal disruption to the ongoing operation. This respondent stated that there was\n\u201cnon-stop testing over 7 months, undertaken by a dedicated IT test and\nimplementation team, with first phase testing done alongside programmers\u201d.\n20\nLooking further ahead, many of the perceived challenges to be faced in the future\nrelated to flexibility. Six respondents cited flexibility directly, nine noted increasing\nSKU ranges, and six noted the likely challenge of further reducing lead-times within\ntheir automated environments. Another important challenge was the likely\nrequirement to reduce operating costs still further, cited by seven respondents.\nReasons for project difficulties\nInterestingly, the two projects that were associated with extensive disruption to the\nongoing operations were the same two projects that overran budgeted costs. One of\nthese projects also overran on time. The only other project that overran in terms of\ntime suffered from moderate disruption to the ongoing operations. There thus appears\nto be an association between these implementation \u201csuccess\u201d factors (e.g. time\noverruns causing disruption, or badly managed projects resulting in poor performance\nin each of these areas).\nAn inspection of the results does not show any apparent relationship of these\n\u201csuccess\u201d factors to many of the project attributes mentioned, such as the respondent\ncategory (e.g. consultant), nature of the project (e.g. greenfield site), equipment type\n(e.g. sortation), sponsor, operational specification team, or the use of simulation.\nHowever, there are two attributes that may be related. Firstly, the reasons for\nautomation were given as \u201cto reduce operating cost\u201d and \u201cto reduce staffing levels\u201d\nfor both of the sites that had major disruption. Cost reduction was also associated\nwith 4 sites that experienced \u201cmoderate\u201d disruption, but only two sites that had\n21\n\u201cminimal\u201d disruption, and zero sites that had \u201cno\u201d disruption. The sample size does\nnot allow a statistical correlation to be established, but this may warrant further\nresearch. Inspection of the responses from the two problem sites appears to indicate\nother aspects associated with a concentration on cost reduction, such as one using \u201cthe\nacceptance of penalty clauses\u201d as a criterion for supplier selection. Statements from\nrespondents at the two sites also referred to \u201ccompletely unrealistic expectations, with\nno validation\u201d and \u201cexpectations were too high\u201d. Unrealistic cost benefit analyses\nthus also appear to have been associated with these two sites.\nThe second attribute that may be related to disruption is that of the project and\nimplementation timescales. The two sites that suffered extensive disruption had an\naverage project time-span of 7 months and \u201cramp up\u201d of less than a month, compared\nto the overall averages of 20 months and 3 months respectively. This contrasts to the\nsites that had no disruption, which had an average project time-span of 20 months and\na \u201cramp up\u201d of 1 month (i.e. much closer to the overall averages). Owing to the wide\nrange of project types (and hence complexity), it is difficult to provide firm\nconclusions from this sample size, but this appears to support the importance of\nsetting realistic timescales mentioned in the literature (Naish & Baker, 2004).\nInterestingly, the two companies that listed implementation capability as a key\nselection criterion suffered only minor or no disruption.\nThe survey also asked about lessons learned from the projects. The pitfalls to\navoid that were mentioned for the two projects that appeared to have gone wrong\nwere around the need for good initial planning. The advice included:\n22\n\uf0a7 \u201cPlan, plan some more\u201d.\n\uf0a7 \u201cPlan it, scrutinise it, criticise it, refine it \u2013 on paper before you put it\nin. One month additional planning will save six months post-\nimplementation headaches. Difficult to debug system that has been\nbadly engineered\u201d.\nThe benefits of longer timescales than planned were also mentioned by four other\nrespondents, and thus these qualitative comments appear to reinforce the importance\nof setting out realistic timescales for warehouse automation projects.\nOther lessons learned that were mentioned more than once were:\n\uf0a7 Equipment commissioning: the importance of test scripts, leverage on\nsupplier, phased approach (5 projects)\n\uf0a7 Involvement and training of operational staff (5 projects)\n\uf0a7 Attention to system interfaces and testing (3 projects)\n\uf0a7 Clear responsibilities (3 projects)\n\uf0a7 Key performance indicator monitoring (3 projects)\nMany of these lessons stemmed from the desire to minimise any \u201cservice level dip\u201d\nthat may occur in any such future projects.\nOne respondent, who suffered no disruption to the ongoing operation, stated that\nthis was achieved by developing a \u201cvery detailed plan of how the operation would\ncontinue as each new piece of equipment was installed, and each old part dismantled\u201d.\nConclusion\n23\nWhilst both improved service and lower costs are significant reasons for companies to\nimplement warehouse automation, it is the imperative of the need to accommodate\ngrowth that is found to be the main reason. There are various factors that may lead to\nan increased scale of operation, such as business acquisitions, inventory\nconsolidation, product range proliferation and the increased safety stock associated\nwith lengthy global supply chains. In such circumstances, the literature indicates that\nautomation is a means of achieving the necessary throughput at high levels of speed\nand accuracy, whilst maintaining costs at an acceptable level. The accommodation of\ngrowth as an additional major reason for automation extends the understanding of this\narea from that set out by Dadzie & Johnston (1991).\nThe large number of steps involved in automation projects reflects the inherent\ncomplexity of such projects, but the process that has evolved appears to be fairly\nsuccessful in keeping projects on time and within budget. There is however a real risk\nof a \u201cservice level dip\u201d and this needs to be addressed in the planning process.\nAlthough there are formal planning processes in place for most automation projects,\nthese appear to be focussed chiefly on the installation of the new equipment rather\nthan on the management of the ongoing operation. In fact, only one survey response\nmentioned a detailed plan for the ongoing operations (and that project was one that\nhad no \u201cservice level dip\u201d). This may be an area that needs to be addressed by\npractitioners.\nThe implementation of warehouse automation frequently involves fairly lengthy\nprojects (averaging 20 months) and often requires substantial build-up periods\n24\n(averaging 3 months). Automation therefore needs to form part of a long-term plan,\nrather than be part of a short-term response to the market. This implies that\ncompanies need to know with some certainty their overall volumes for the facility, as\nwell as the likely product and order profiles. Flexibility then needs to be built into the\ndesign so that the automated equipment can respond positively to changes that may\noccur to these market requirements. This implies the need to incorporate scenario\nplanning in the design process (as described by Sodhi, 2003), rather than basing the\nproject on \u201cthe business plan\u201d. Although it is common to undertake some sensitivity\nanalyses at the operational specification stage, the use of scenario planning was not\nexplicit in the steps mentioned. Scenario planning may thus represent a valuable\naddition to the formal design process that is used and that is described in the literature\n(e.g. Rouwenhorst et al, 2000, Rowley, 2000, and Rushton et al, 2000).\nThe results of this study indicate that there is a need to understand the strategic\nrole of warehouse automation:\n- Automation is often motivated by the need to achieve business growth and,\nfrom the literature, this appears to be, in particular, to gain the supply chain\nbenefits of inventory centralisation whilst maintaining costs in the resultant\nlarge distribution centres at acceptable levels.\n- Automation may involve flexibility risks and thus scenario planning needs to\nbe undertaken at the business requirements stage, involving such principles as\ndemand chain management (i.e. integrated decisions taking into account\nmarketing and supply chain factors concurrently).\n25\n- Automation may also involve service levels risks and these need to be fully\naddressed in the planning for the management of the ongoing operation, as\nwell as in the time allowed for \u201csnagging\u201d the automated equipment. Realistic\ntimescales appear to be an important pre-condition to avoiding any \u201cservice\nlevel dip\u201d.\nIn summary, it appears from industry figures that the adoption of warehouse\nautomation is continuing to grow and, from this research, the main reasons are\nassociated with growth, cost and service. There are however real concerns about\ndisruption to the ongoing operation in the short term and the degree of future\nflexibility in the longer term. Further research is required in these areas to explore\nthe key characteristics of successful implementations and to understand how (and to\nwhat extent) warehouse automation can be designed to provide responsiveness to\nrapidly changing market conditions.\n26\nReferences\nAdams, N.D., Brown, T.W., Firth, R.V.D. and Misenheimer, L.P.
