It provides information about the response of selected\noutput variables to variations in input parameters driving the model. In physically based models such as\nEUROSEM (Morgan et al., 1998a), single values are used to represent soil, vegetation and topography\nparameters over an entire grid cell, assuming that these areas are homogeneous. The single output values\nobtained from using these models consequently do not reflect the variability within each of the grid cells\n(Quinton, 1997).\nCopyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The basic theory of Monte Carlo simulation is described in detail in Veihe and Quinton (2000).\nWhen parameterizing input parameters describing the surface and catchment characteristics in\nEUROSEM, two conditions are particularly important. One is the description of concentrated flow paths\nincluding rills, tractor wheelings and plough furrows (referred to as rills in this paper), and the other is the\ncover of rock fragments. Studies of rill and interrill erosion by Govers and Poesen (1988) and Vandaele and\nPoesen (1995) have shown that provided both rill and interrill erosion takes place, soil loss within a\ncatchment mainly stems from rills, the development of which depends on the slope steepness, the activation\nof sidewall processes and gullying in the channel network. It also has been shown that soil loss associated\nwith rills varies with time and is highly dependent on the rainfall pattern (Fullen and Reed, 1987; Hasholt\nand Hansen, 1995; Vandaele and Poesen, 1995).\nOver the last decade, the e\u0080ect of rock fragment cover on soil erosion has attracted considerable attention\nand the need for incorporating this parameter in physically based soil erosion models has been widely\naccepted (Casenave and Valentin, 1989; Poesen et al., 1994). It is particularly important to include the e\u0080ect\nof rock fragments if models are to be used in, for instance, the Mediterranean and in many parts of Africa,\nwhere rock fragments often occupy more than 60% of the land (Casenave and Valentin, 1989; Poesen and\nLavee, 1994; Folly, 1997).\nIn this study, rock fragments are defined as mineral particles 2 mm or larger in diameter, including all sizes\nthat have horizontal dimensions less than the size of a pedon (Poesen and Lavee, 1994). The observed e\u0080ect\nof rock fragments on soil loss in previous studies has varied from acting as a mulch to reduce soil erosion\n(Wishmeier and Smith, 1978; Collinet and Valentin, 1984; Casenave and Valentin, 1989) to increase runo\u0080\nand thereby soil erosion (Poesen and Ingelmo-Sanchez, 1992; Moustakas et al., 1995). The e\u0080ect is clearly\nambivalent and depends upon the spatial scale, porosity of the soil, the embedding and the size of the rock\nfragments as well as the steepness of the slope (Poesen et al., 1990; Roy and Jarrett, 1991; Poesen, 1992;\nBunte and Poesen, 1993; Bunte and Poesen, 1994; Poesen et al., 1994). An important aspect of rock fragment\ncover is also its water conserving ability (Danalatos et al., 1995; van Wesemael et al., 1995) which should be\ntaken into consideration when modelling.\nParameterizing models with respect to rock fragment cover can, however, be rather di\u0081cult because cover\ncharacteristics in terms of percentage of rock fragments, rock fragment size and the embedding of these can\nvary considerably within short distances (Folly, 1997). This variation is in some cases related to catenas, as\nshown by Simanton et al. (1994) and Poesen et al. (1998). For elements that are smaller than 1 m2 or larger\nthan 100 m2, the e\u0080ect of rock fragments is to reduce erosion, whereas for elements between 1 m2 and 100 m2\nin size, rock fragments may act to either decrease or increase erosion, depending on their position on the\nsurface and the porosity of the soil, as illustrated in Figure 1 (Poesen and Ingelmo-Sanchez, 1992; Poesen\net al., 1994).\nToebat et al. (1994) carried out a simple sensitivity analysis of an earlier version of EUROSEM with\nspecial emphasis on rock fragment cover and it is one of the few studies that have been carried out on this\nissue so far. By using a single data set, the e\u0080ect of each of the input parameters expressing rock fragment\ncover on runo\u0080 and erosion was determined for a range of input values and compared with experimental\nfindings.\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the sensitivity of EUROSEM (version 3.6, July 1998) to changes in\nsurface and catchment characteristics, with particular emphasis on the e\u0080ect of rills and rock fragment cover.\nThe sensitivity analysis will be carried out primarily using Monte Carlo simulation but will be supplemented\nby a simple sensitivity analysis, where input parameters are increased and decreased by 10% and the e\u0080ect on\nthe output parameters studied.\nCopyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

POESEN\nTHE EUROSEM MODEL\nThe European soil erosion model (EUROSEM) is a single event process-based model for predicting soil\nerosion by water from fields and small catchments. The model is based on a physical description of the\nerosion processes and operates for short time steps, in the region of one minute (Morgan et al., 1998a). A\nmore detailed description of the model structure is described in Veihe and Quinton (2000).\nIn the EUROSEMmodel all types of concentrated flow paths are treated as rills and are described in terms\nof their width, depth and side slope as well as their number per element width. It is also possible to specify\nwhether the rills are of uniform depth over the whole length of the plane or whether the depth increases\ndownslope. In the last mentioned case, the rill geometry is specified at the bottom of the element and scaled\nautomatically within the model (Morgan et al., 1998b).\nThe e\u0080ects of rock fragment cover are simulated using the three parameters of ROC, PAVE and ISTONE\n(Morgan et al., 1998a). The ROC parameter is used to reduce the overall storage of water in the soil using the\nequation:\nBROC \u0088 B\u00851 \u00ff ROC\u0086 \u00851\u0086\nwhere BROC is the parameter Bmodified for rock fragments (mm min\n\u00ff1), B is an integral capillary and water\ndeficit parameter of the soil (mm min\u00ff1) and ROC is the fraction of the topsoil composed of rock fragments,\nexpressed as a volume.\nFigure 1. E\u0080ect of fine earth structure and position of rock fragments in the soil top layer on the relationship between rock fragment\ncover and relative interrill sediment yield. A positive relationship is observed for rock fragments partly incorporated into a surface seal\nwhich developed on a top layer with essentially textural pore spaces (1) or on a top layer with structural pore spaces (2); a negative\nrelationship is observed for rock fragments embedded in a top layer with structural porosity (3) or for rock fragments resting on the\nsurface of a soil top layer characterized by either essentially textural pore spaces (4) or by structural pore spaces (5) (Poesen et al., 1994)\nCopyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Hydrol. Process. 14, 927\u2013939 (2000)\nSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF EUROSEM, PART II 929\nThe PAVE parameter reduces the area of fine earth exposed to raindrop impact using the equation:\nDETpav \u0088 DET\u00851 \u00ff PAVE\u0086 \u00852\u0086\nwhere DETpav is the detachment rate allowing for the non-erodible surface (m\n3 s\u00ff1 m\u00ff1) and PAVE is the\nproportion (between 0 and 1) of the soil surface covered by non-erodible surface.\nFinally, the e\u0080ective saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil is a\u0080ected using the equation:\nKsroc \u0088 Ks\u00851 \u00ff PAVE\u0086 \u00853\u0086\nor\nKsroc \u0088 Ks\u00851 \u0087 PAVE\u0086 \u00854\u0086\nwhere Ksroc is a modified value of saturated hydraulic conductivity (mm min\n\u00ff1) and PAVE is the rock\nfragment cover, expressed as a fraction.\nIt is the sign of ISTONE that determines whether the e\u0080ect of PAVE is to increase or decrease the\nsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil (Equations 3 and 4). Rocks that are embedded in a surface seal\nwill reduce infiltration (Equation 3), whereas rocks that rest on the surface or are surrounded by macropores\nwill be modelled as protecting the soil structure and promote infiltration (Equation 4) (Poesen and Ingelmo-\nSanchez, 1992; Morgan et al., 1998a). It is the user who predetermines how the rock fragment e\u0080ect works\ndepending on personal judgment.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe methodology used for the sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation is outlined in detail in\nVeihe and Quinton (2000). The sample statistics for the theoretical slope plane showing the expected\nparameter variability of the input parameters describing the surface and catchment characteristics are shown\nin Table I. Random variates of these input parameters were generated based on the sample statistics and their\nassociated probability distributions. All input distributions were assumed to be normally distributed except\nfor values of Manning\u2019s n, which is assumed to exhibit a log-normal distribution. Four thousand simulations\nwere made using a 50 mm storm event with a delayed pattern, as described in Veihe and Quinton (2000).\nTable I.

POESEN\nThree sets of Monte Carlo simulations were carried out using EUROSEMmodified for sensitivity analysis\npurposes, i.e. the introduction of a routine that allows the model to run a specified number of times using an\ninput parameter file with randomly selected sets of input parameter values. This enabled a simulation of a\nsituation without any rock fragments and two with rock fragments either embedded in the soil surface or\nresting on the surface. The static model predictors that were examined with respect to their sensitivity\nconsisted of total runo\u0080, total soil loss, peak flow rate and peak sediment discharge, and time to runo\u0080, time\nto peak flow rate, time to peak sediment discharge and duration of runo\u0080 were assessed based on their\nrelative frequency distributions only. Sensitivity was assessed using beta (b), which is the normalized slope\nfor the independent variables derived through stepwise multiple linear regression, as described in Veihe and\nQuinton (2000). Finally, an average hydrograph and an average sedigraph were produced, with a graph\nshowing the coe\u0081cient of variation through the rainfall event.\nThe sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was supplemented by a simple sensitivity analysis\ncovering both embedded rock fragments and rock fragments lying on the soil surface. The input parameters\nlisted in Table I were increased and decreased by 10% and the changes in the output parameters observed.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nRelative frequency distributions of static output parameters\nFor the static output parameters of time to peak flow rate, time to peak sediment discharge, time to runo\u0080\nand duration of runo\u0080, little variation was observed in output values, whereas the relative frequency\ndistributions for the remaining static output parameters (Figures 2 and 3) was high. The ability of the model\nto predict time to peak flow rate and time to peak sediment discharge accurately corresponded with the\nobservations for the hydrological, soil and vegetation parameters (Veihe and Quinton, 2000). On the other\nhand, parameters describing surface and catchment characteristics influence time to runo\u0080 and duration of\nruno\u0080 a lot less as compared with the hydrological, soil and vegetation parameters, which are influenced by\nchanges in the hydrological parameters. Figure 2 shows that both runo\u0080 and peak flow rate are well defined\nwhen no rock fragments are present, whereas the presence of rock fragments introduces a high variability for\nthe frequency distributions owing to the rock fragment\u2019s e\u0080ect on the hydrology. For the soil loss variable\n(Figure 3) the situation with embedded rock fragments shows a high variability, whereas the variability is\nmuch less when rock fragments rest on the surface or no rock fragments are present, although the latter on\naverage is giving higher soil loss values. A high variability is observed for peak sediment discharge (Figure 3)\nregardless of the conditions, with the variability slightly higher when rock fragments are present as compared\nwith no rock fragments. This indicates that peak sediment discharge is very sensitive to changes in input\nparameter values describing surface and catchment characteristics.\nFigure 2.

Process. 14, 927\u2013939 (2000)\nSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF EUROSEM, PART II 931\nThe variability of the static output parameters is further illustrated in Table II, except for time to runo\u0080\nand peak flow rate, which hardly varied. For the parameters total runo\u0080, peak flow rate, total soil loss and\npeak sediment discharge, embedded rock fragments reduce total runo\u0080 and peak flow rate as compared with\nno rock fragments, whereas the opposite was the case when rock fragments were resting on the surface. Rock\nfragments embedded in the soil reduce the duration of runo\u0080, whereas the opposite is the case when rock\nfragments are resting on the surface. The presence of rock fragments generally reduces time to peak sediment\ndischarge regardless of their position. It is noticeable that whereas total runo\u0080 is in the same range (Table II)\nas observed for theMonte Carlo simulation with the hydrological, soil and vegetation parameters (Veihe and\nQuinton, 2000), soil loss figures are much higher for the surface and catchment parameters, especially when\nrock fragments are embedded. In field conditions this happens too, but only temporarily because the\nincreased erosion rate will expose more rock fragments and these in turn will reduce soil loss when rock\nfragment cover is high.\nFigure 3.

Hydrol. Process. 14, 927\u2013939 (2000)\n932 A. VEIHE, J. QUINTON AND J. POESEN\nThe coe\u0081cient of variation is high, ranging from 0.34 to 1.92 for all static output parameters, except for\ntime to peak sediment discharge and peak flow rate when rock fragments are present, which are somewhat\nlower. The high variability of output parameter values is further supported when looking at the kurtosis\nvalues and shows a much higher variability as compared with the e\u0080ect from the hydrological, soil and\nvegetation parameters (Veihe and Quinton, 2000). All frequency distributions are leptokurtic, which means\nthat the tails of the distributions are fatter than those of a corresponding normal distribution and the\nskewness is generally positive for the parameters runo\u0080, peak flow rate, soil loss and peak sediment dis-\ncharge, indicating a log-normal distribution, which is supported when looking at the frequency distributions\nin Figures 2 and 3.\nThe changes in average runo\u0080 and soil loss figures (Table II) when introducing rock fragments correspond\nwith experimental findings by Poesen et al. (1990 and 1994) for mesoscale plots (see also Figure 1). For\nembedded rock fragments, the increased runo\u0080 results from the reduced infiltration rate and is linked with an\nincreased soil detachment by interrill flow and transport capacity though raindrop detachment is reduced.\nRock fragments resting on the surface protect the soil surface against physical degradation and favour high\ninfiltration rates, leading to a reduction in both runo\u0080 and soil loss. The trends in the degree of variability\nassociated with a particular rock fragment cover illustrated by the envelope curves in Figure 1 were to some\nextent reflected in the Monte Carlo simulations. For simulations with embedded rock fragments, an increase\nin cover from 15 to 65% increased the coe\u0081cient of variation associated with soil loss from 0.44 to 0.64,\nwhereas the increase was from 0.38 to 0.78 for rock fragments resting on the surface. The model response\ntherefore is likely to be better for embedded rock fragments than for rock fragments resting on the surface.\nAlthough the model generated runo\u0080 after 0.5 min, the time at which the hydrograph started to rise varied\naccording to findings by Poesen et al. (1990), with embedded rock fragments providing a quicker response\ntime as compared with situations with rock fragments resting on the surface or no rock fragments.\nSensitivity of static output parameters\nTables III to VI show the sensitivity of the static output parameters with and without rock fragments\n(embedded). For rock fragments resting on the soil surface (not shown), only total soil loss appeared to be\nsensitive to changes \u2014 mainly in rill slope, number of rills, length of plane and depth of rills. The model is\ngenerally sensitive to changes in input parameter values when rock fragments are embedded in the topsoil,\nparticularly when it comes to peak flow rate, whereas little e\u0080ect is observed in the situation without rock\nfragments (see Tables III to VI). The increased sensitivity of the model when rock fragments are embedded is\nattributed to rock fragment\u2019s e\u0080ect on the saturated hydraulic conductivity, which is relatively more\npronounced for embedded rock fragments as compared with rock fragments resting on the surface. The\nincreased sensitivity of the model with embedded rock fragments also a\u0080ects the sensitivity of the model to\nother input parameters. The importance of choosing the right parameter values to describe surface and\ncatchment characteristics is therefore increased when rock fragments are embedded.\nTable III.

None of the simulations including rock\nfragments, however, indicate any sensitivity of the static output parameters to changes in the fraction of rock\nfragments. This can be explained by the fact that the fraction of rock fragments a\u0080ect the overall storage of\nwater in the soil, whereas the fraction of non-erodible material changes the saturated hydraulic conductivity\nof the soil shown to a\u0080ect output variables considerably (Veihe and Quinton, 2000). Generally speaking, the\nstatic output parameters are a lot less sensitive to changes in parameters describing surface and catchment\ncharacteristics as compared with the hydrological, soil and vegetation parameters.\nThe great sensitivity of the model to changes in parameters describing rills calls for careful parameteriza-\ntion of these parameters. Whereas the characteristics of a single rill can be estimated quite easily, it is much\nmore di\u0081cult to parameterize elements containing both wheel tracks and rills with di\u0080erent characteristics in\nterms of width, depth, slope, etc. The parameterization of rill characteristics is further made di\u0081cult because\nof rill dynamics, with their location and dimensions changing temporally. This study shows the importance\nof developing models that can predict the location of rills and their development through time.\nDynamic output parameters\nThe average hydrographs and sedigraphs with and without rock fragments and their associated coe\u0081cient\nof variation are illustrated in Figure 4. The di\u0080erences in time to peak flow rate are negligible as noticed for\nthe static output parameters. When rock fragments are embedded, the hydrograph starts to rise after about\n26 min, whereas the equivalent time is 40 min when no rock fragments are present and 42 min when rock\nfragments are resting on the surface. If the time to runo\u0080 is ignored, the time at which the hydrographs start\nrising corresponds with experimental findings by Poesen et al. (1990) and shows that on average the model is\nable to reflect the e\u0080ect of rock fragment cover quite well.\nThe coe\u0081cient of variation for the hydrographs (Figure 4) varies depending on the presence of rock\nfragments, but is generally low, whereas the hydrographs are at their peak and with the highest coe\u0081cient of\nvariation at the tail of the hydrographs. For the sedigraphs (Figure 4), the coe\u0081cient of variation is low at the\npeak of the hydrographs and increases towards the tail, whereas the highest coe\u0081cient of variation is\nobserved during the first 30 min of the rainstorm. This reflects the fact that runo\u0080 alternately picks up and\ndeposits sediment at this stage, although the amount transported is small. The coe\u0081cient of variation is\ngenerally much higher (up to three times higher) as compared with the coe\u0081cient of variation found for the\nhydrological, soil and vegetation parameters (Veihe and Quinton, 2000). This shows that the dynamic output\nparameters overall are more sensitive to changes in the surface characteristics immediately when runo\u0080 and\nsoil loss starts and at the tail of the hydrographs and sedigraphs. However, overall the hydrographs and\nsedigraphs are predicted quite accurately by the model.\nSimple sensitivity analysis\nThe simple sensitivity analysis showed that the model is not sensitive to changes in rill slope, side slope of\nthe rills and the downslope roughness. The sensitivity of the model to the remaining surface and catchment\nparameters is shown in Figure 5 where the e\u0080ect of rock fragments\u2019 position on soil loss has been examined.\nChanges in runo\u0080 values were almost not noticeable . The model is most sensitive to changes in interrill slope\nand length of slope followed by the fraction covered by non-erodible material under conditions where the\nelement size is smaller than 1 m2 or larger than 100 m2 or where stones are resting on the surface (see\nFigure 1). Apart from the rill width and the fraction of rock fragments resting on the surface, the model is\nfairly sensitive to changes in the remaining parameters.\nWhereas a decrease in PAVE by 10% increases soil loss by as much as 8.8% when rock fragments are\nresting on the surface, a decrease of 3.6% is observed when stones are embedded. The response of the model\nto changes in PAVE correspond with findings from experiments carried out by Poesen et al. (1994) (see\nFigure 1) with an increase in total soil loss for increasing rock fragment cover when rock fragments are\nembedded and vice versa. For the fraction of rock fragments (ROC) the situation is di\u0080erent, with an\nincrease in soil loss of 2.8% when ROC is increased and a 3.6% decrease when ROC is decreased, and with a\nCopyright # 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This reflects a similar trend as observed for PAVE, with the model being relatively more sensitive\nwhen rock fragments are resting on the surface provided PAVE is kept constant. The higher response to\nchanges in rock-related parameters when the rock fragments are resting on the surface should be seen in light\nof the generally much lower average soil loss of 0.3 tons as opposed to about 1.4 tons when rock fragments\nare embedded, and reflects the non-linear relationship between saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil loss.\nA series of simulations were carried out for a range of rock fragment cover percentages to investigate the\nextent to which the model describes the relationship shown in Figure 1. When rock fragments are resting on\nthe surface, an exponentially decreasing function was found (y \u0088 1.0736e\u00ff0.0122x), which indicates that\nthe model response to changes in the percentage of embedded rock fragments is less than what has been\nobserved in the laboratory, where b is larger than 0.02 (see Figure 1). A linear relationship was found\n(y \u0088 0\u0001017x \u0087 1\u000106) when simulating the e\u0080ect of embedded rock fragment percentages up to a cover of\n60%, after which sediment yield decreased drastically as rock fragment cover was increased. The e\u0080ect of the\npercentage of embedded rock fragments on interrill yields corresponded very well with observations made by\nPoesen et al. (1994) (see also Figure 1).\nAs expected, the simple sensitivity analysis gives a di\u0080erent picture of which parameters the model is most\nsensitive to as compared with the sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. This reflects the fact that\nthe Monte Carlo simulation takes into account the real variation in parameter values, the uncertainty\nassociated with parameterizing the individual parameters and the interaction between these, whereas the\nsimple sensitivity analysis considers uniform percentage wise changes in parameter values. Although the\nmodel is most sensitive to changes in slope length and slope, these parameters are easy to assess as opposed\nto, for instance, rock fragment cover and their embedding.\nIn the field rock fragments are often both embedded and resting on the surface (Folly, 1997; Mati,\npersonal communication). This situation is expected to decrease runo\u0080 and thereby soil erosion, although a\nlot less as compared with when rock fragments are resting on the surface (Poesen and Lavee, 1997). This\nsituation currently cannot be modelled explicitly by EUROSEM but may be approximated by simulating a\nsituation with a reduced number of rock fragments resting on the surface. Another aspect that the model\ndoes not take into account is the size of the rock fragments, which influences overland flow hydraulics (Bunte\nFigure 5.

Hydrol. Process. 14, 927\u2013939 (2000)\nSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF EUROSEM, PART II 937\nand Poesen, 1994). It also must be emphasized that when parameterizing the model, the user should take into\naccount the size of the plot, which determines the e\u0080ect of rock fragments (Poesen et al., 1994). More\nresearch is required for the above-mentioned conditions to be incorporated in EUROSEM.\nFinally, the number and dimension of rills and wheel tracks, if both of them are present within the same\nelement, have to be parameterized carefully and the e\u0080ect of these parameters can be assessed running a\nrange of simulations for di\u0080erent rill conditions.\nCONCLUSION\nThis study showed that rock fragment cover has a significant e\u0080ect upon the frequency distributions of the\nstatic output parameters of total soil loss, peak sediment discharge and in particular runo\u0080 and peak flow\nrate. The coe\u0081cient of variation for the static output parameters was high, but on average the runo\u0080 and soil\nloss calculations from the simulations with and without rock fragments corresponded with experimental\nstudies.\nThe average hydrographs and sedigraphs were associated with a high coe\u0081cient of variation, except for\nthe peak of the graphs, which was simulated accurately. When comparing the time at which the hydrograph\nstarts to rise with experimental studies, it appeared that EUROSEM was able to model the e\u0080ect of rock\nfragment cover well.\nBased on the Monte Carlo simulation, the model proved most sensitive to changes in parameters\ndescribing rills and the length of the plane when no rock fragments were present, and the fraction covered by\nnon-erodible material was important when rock fragments were embedded, as well as interrill slope. For\nsimulations where rock fragments rest on the surface, changes in parameter values did not significantly a\u0080ect\nmodel output. Overall, the results from the Monte Carlo simulation were supported by the results from the\nsimple sensitivity analysis and show that the model is not very sensitive to changes in the volume fraction of\nrock fragments (ROC) in the top layer, but very sensitive to changes in the soil surface fraction occupied by\nnon-erodible material (PAVE) because of the e\u0080ect of PAVE on saturated hydraulic conductivity. It was also\nshown that EUROSEM simulated interrill sediment yield associated with the percentage of rock fragment\ncover well, particularly when rock fragments are embedded. This study shows the importance of choosing\nthe right parameter values for both rills and rock fragment cover if a successful model simulation with\nEUROSEM should be achieved and that more studies are required in the future to improve the modelling of\nthese conditions.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research work was carried out as part of the SPIES project (Soil Productivity Indices and their Erosion\nSensitivity), project no.
