All adopted partnership as their official policy position on \nworkplace relations (though recently there have been signs of its star starting to wane among the \nso-called \u201eawkward squad\u201f of new trade union leaders: see Morgan, 2004; Woodley, 2004). \nMore qualified support even came from employers\u201f bodies such as the CBI (see Taylor, 1997), \nand the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD, 1998: 8).  \n \nThat each can have found something in the idea to embrace is an indication of partnership\u201fs \nconsiderable rhetorical appeal, with its \u201cconnotations of co-operation for mutual gain\u201d (Tailby & \nWinchester, 2000: 374), but it also points to its \u201cinherent ambiguity\u201d (Bacon & Storey, 2000: \n409).  \n \nOne such ambiguity concerns the identity of the \u201epartners\u201f in this relationship. In particular, who \nor what might constitute the \u201epartner\u201f body for an organisation\u201fs employees? The assumption in \nthe academic literature on partnership, dominated as it is by research and commentary \nconducted within an industrial relations framework, has been that any partnership arrangement \nworthy of the name must involve an independent representative body acting on the workforce\u201fs \nbehalf (i.e. a trade union). Thus, the \u201epartnership\u201f relationship is considered to be between the \norganisation\u201fs management team and the recognised trade union(s). Indeed, partnership has been \nexamined almost exclusively according to its impact on trade unions (Claydon, 1998; Gall, \n2001; Geary & Roche, 2003; Haynes & Allen, 2001; Heaton et al., 2002; Heery, 2002; Kelly, \n1996; Martinez-Lucio & Stuart, 2002; Oxenbridge & Brown, 2002; Terry, 2003; Wills, 2004). \nHowever, the main advocates of partnership in the 1990s, the Involvement and Participation \nAssociation, not to mention the New Labour government, the CBI and CIPD, prefer to conceive \nof partnership as collaborative, mutually beneficial relations between an employer\u201fs \nmanagement team and its workforce primarily, with the latter represented by a trade union if \npresent. Reconfigured in this manner, \u201epartnership\u201f is a state of workplace affairs that is \nattainable \u2013 in theory, at least \u2013 in all settings, unionised and non-unionised alike, and hence has \na potentially far broader appeal as a model of employment relations. Discussion of the latter \nphenomenon, however, is almost non-existent (see IPA, 1997: 17; IRS, 2000: 35-41; Terry, \n2001). This paper sets out to address this gap.  \n \nWe examine three questions in this paper. Firstly, what is workplace partnership? Secondly, can \na non-unionised organisation design and conduct its people management processes in a \nrecognisably \u201epartnership\u201f manner? Thirdly, if it can, what would it be like to work in such a \nplace? We explore these issues through a content-analysis of the most commonly used \ndefinitions of partnership to see whether compliance is conceivable in a non-unionised setting, \nand then through an in-depth case study of the practical implementation of a \u201epartnership\u201f inside \na non-unionised firm.  \n  \nA definition of partnership. \nAlthough no widely-held standard definition exists for workplace partnership, most \ncommentators understand it to mean a programme for managing workplace employment \nrelations based on joint problem solving among the various \u201epartners\u201f which delivers mutually \nbeneficial outcomes for all (for detailed reviews see Ackers & Payne, 1998; Kelly, 2004; \nSparrow and Marchington, 1998; Tailby & Winchester, 2000; Terry, 2003). Dietz (2004: 7), \nfollowing Guest and Peccei (2001: 208), argues that a genuine \u201epartnership\u201f organisation should \nbe able to point to the established and observable presence of a \u201ebundle\u201f of specific principles \n 4 \nand practices for managing its employment relations in such a manner. He argues that the two \nmost commonly cited and most influential definitions - from the Involvement and Participation \nAssociation (IPA, 1992; 1997) and the TUC (TUC, 1999) - offer a model for this, based on six \nkey elements:\n1\n \n1. A joint commitment to the success of the enterprise \n2. Mutual recognition of the legitimate interests of each constituency: management, \nemployees and trade unions (where present) \n3. A mutual commitment and effort to develop and sustain good working relationships, \ncharacterised by high levels of trust. \n4. Structures and practices that allow for information sharing and joint problem solving \nbetween the workforce and management at all levels of the organisation \n5. Policies and practices to address the balance needed between flexible work practices and \nemployment security \n6. Policies and practices to share the success of the organisation. \n \nTo take each in turn, elements 1-3 are considered to be organisational values (Marchington, \n1998), or \u201ecommitments\u201f (IPA, 1992; 1997), endorsed by all parties which serve as enduring \nguiding principles for the management of employment relations within the organisation. \nHowever, the distinguishing characteristic of a genuine and, indeed, sustainable and viable \npartnership is how these three commitments, and for non-union forms the second in particular, \nare translated into the mediation and satisfaction of different constituencies\u201f interests at work.  \n \nThe central process through which partnership is established and conducted, and its outcomes \nsecured, is continuous joint problem solving, alongside open and timely exchange of honest and \naccurate information, on a broad range of significant decisions affecting employees\u201f working \nlives (element \u201e4\u201f above). The process has as its primary objective the delivery of mutually \nacceptable gains for all parties, realised in a process that is considered qualitatively superior to \nadversarialist forms of engagement. The structure and content of these arrangements is expected \nto involve permanent \u201eemployee voice mechanisms\u201f at the local and strategic levels (IPA, 1997; \nIRS, 2000: 7), through which employees\u201f views are sought, and if necessary acted upon, before \nthe decision is taken. Importantly, these arrangements can take direct consultative and\/or \nindirect representational forms. (The TUC model, understandably, views direct forms only as an \nagenda-setting prelude to formal union-employer discussions.) Its vital quality is that \nemployees\u201f input into organisational decision-making must be freely facilitated, informed, \nproactive and influential on the final outcome, in a manner befitting the description \u201ejoint \nproblem solving\u201f.  \n \nTwo main policy outcomes are produced. The first is a \u201cbalance between employment security \nand flexibility\u201d (element 5 above). What constitutes flexibility will vary from organisation to \norganisation, while \u201eemployment security\u201f is described as \u201ca stable employment framework\u201d \n                                                 \n1\n Other conceptualisations and operationalisations contain more or less these same key elements. For example, \nGuest and Peccei (2001) operationalise 15 separate principles on the broad theme of mutuality (tellingly omitting \n\u201eautonomous worker representation\u201f as a pre-requisite), plus a comprehensive range of possible management \npractices, bundled into 8 factors centring on worker participation, two-way communication, job flexibility, \nperformance management, financial participation schemes, harmonisation and employment security. Haynes and \nAllen (2001: 167) depict partnership as involving mutual legitimation of partners\u201f different interests, a commitment \nto co-operative processes, joint decision-making\/ consultation, a focus on organisational success and employment \nsecurity. Marchington (1998) presents partnership on three levels: values (including the legitimacy of employee \nvoice; a mutual agenda on competitive performance and flexibility, and a commitment to trust and openness); \noperational policies (direct communication; upward problem solving; financial involvement schemes, and \nrepresentative participation), and complementary HRM practices (single-status and harmonisation; employment \nsecurity, and training and learning). In other words, the spirit and content of most conceptualisations are similar; \nonly how it is sub-divided into categories differs. \n 5 \n(IPA, 1997: 2) provided through, for example, a multi-year pay deal and\/or a no-compulsory \nredundancy guarantee, complemented with careful joint management of unavoidable job losses, \nincluding policies for redeployment, retraining and job search support. The second policy \noutcome is \u201esharing organisational success\u201f (element 6 above). For the IPA, this incorporates not \njust good basic pay and participation in results-based reward schemes such as employee share \nownership, profit-sharing or gain-sharing bonuses, but also organisation-wide celebrations of \nimproved performance, staff \u201eperks\u201f, and harmonised terms and conditions. (The TUC\u201fs model \nconfines the explicit benefits to employees somewhat narrowly to a \u201cfocus on the quality of \nworking life\u201d and \u201cpersonal development\u201d; financial reward is not addressed.)  \n \nA genuine partnership organisation can therefore be operationalised according to the extent to \nwhich its approach to people management contain principles, policies and practices that address \neach of these elements (see Dietz, 2004; Guest and Peccei, 2001). Moreover, to be considered a \npartnership organisation, these policies and practices should be accorded some degree of \nembedded permanence.  \n \nGiven these exacting standards - particularly regarding staff consultation - trade unions, and \ntheir supporters, argue that only unions can provide the independence, strength and wealth of \nexperience that permits effective joint problem solving (USDAW, 1998: 3). Unrepresented \nworkers, they argue, lack the safeguards provided by trained professional representatives, and \nthe strength derived from collective action. However, while we would readily agree with Guest \nand Peccei (2001) that partnership is far more likely to be observed in unionised representative \nforms, the six criteria for a legitimate partnership above do not rule out non-unionised forms. \nTwo seem to us to be most critical: firstly, that the employee voice is adequately and freely \nfacilitated at all levels such that employees enjoy significant influence over organisational \ndecision-making and, secondly, that these joint problem-solving processes deliver regular, \nsubstantial benefits to both the management team and the workforce (Coupar, 1999). We draw \non an in-depth case study inside one such non-unionised company to explore these issues.  \n \nMethodology and limitations. \nThe case study firm, Sportasia, featured in an article in People Management (Trapp, 2000) from \nwhich it appeared that its people management practices might conform to the operationalisation \nfor a genuine partnership detailed above. An exploratory interview with the Managing Director \nconfirmed this impression.  \n \nThe fieldwork from which this case study has been developed was undertaken by two separate \nteams of researchers on five separate visits to the company in 2000 and 2001.\n2\n A total of 38 \nsemi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 different interviewees (see Appendix), \nincluding all senior managers, several line managers and a sample of 20 \u201enon-key players\u201f from \nthe production and administrative functions selected at random from a list of staff. Interviews \nwere conducted on a one-to-one basis, using open-ended questions to discuss the company and \nits history, and the respondent\u201fs experience and assessment of its system of governance and \npeople management practices, focussing particularly on commentary on the six partnership \nelements above. Interviews lasted between 35 minutes to 2 hours, depending on how much the \nperson had to say. A hand-written record was made of interviewees\u201f comments, and several \ninterviews were also tape-recorded. Respondents\u201f accounts of each element of partnership were \nthen pooled, collated, analysed and cross-referenced to produce the case study that follows. \nAdditional material was sourced from informal meetings, observing company workshops, \ndocuments, conference presentations, and media reports.  \n                                                 \n2\n Note that the case study covers developments in the firm up to this point. The company has since adapted many of \nits policies, and research is currently ongoing into these new developments. \n 6 \n \nEfforts to triangulate the data and to corroborate testimonies have reduced the impact of the \nmethodological limitations inherent in the use of semi-structured interviews (notably problems \nsurrounding subjective opinion passing as \u201efact\u201f). One preventative measure undertaken was to \nask the key contact (the Managing Director) to approve for accuracy the narrative section \npresented here. He requested no amendments. However, as with any case study, the content is \nultimately our interpretation of the interviews \u201eas a piece\u201f. \n \nSportasia \u2013 background. \nSportasia is a privately-owned enterprise encompassing three businesses: \u201cpersonalised school \nwear\u201d such as sweatshirts, T-shirts, knitwear, skirts, dresses and sports kit sold under its brand \nname, \u201eSchool Trends\u201f; similar clothing products for the health and leisure industries, and a \nseparate management consultancy arm established to \u201cpromote Sportasia\u201fs philosophies and \nvalues\u201d as well as generate additional revenue. The entire operation is based on a single site in \nSheffield. In 2001 it employed 90 employees (June 2004 figure: 125). It was, and remains, the \nmarket leader for primary schools, supplying nearly 25% of the schools in the UK. The firm \nenjoys 90% year on year repeat business. In 2002 it posted \u00a31m profits on a turnover of \u00a37.7m. \n \nIts business process is as follows: telemarketers, trained in-house, arrange appointments with \ncustomers for the firm\u201fs team of 21 regional sales representatives. They secure contracts, and \nthese are processed back at headquarters. Designers create computer programs of the customer\u201fs \nlogos and emblems, the program is then loaded onto disk and run on machines that either \nembroider or screen-print the designs onto the products. (These are sourced from three main \nsuppliers with factories in the UK, Turkey and Portugal, each of which is audited annually for \ncompliance with strict standards on production and working conditions.) The finished product is \npacked and despatched from the warehouse to the customer. As the majority of customers are \nschools, the work is highly seasonal. To cope with the increased workload during the summer \nmonths the firm uses a small pool of \u201ecasual\u201f staff.  \n \nPartnership at Sportasia \u2013 the development.  \nA feature of Sportasia\u201fs progress toward partnership is that it did not emerge in response to a \ncrisis, or from a restructuring, or from a generalised need to improve workplace relations, as is \ntypically the case for unionised examples (Kelly, 2004: 270). Instead, the Managing Director\u201fs \npeople management philosophy when he formed the company in 1988 was to create an \nenjoyable work environment for himself personally, centring on two key values: a strong sense \nof the workplace as a \u201ecommunity\u201f of shared interests, and the pursuit of individual employee\u201fs \n\u201eself-actualisation\u201f (cf. Maslow, 1943) within the community.  \n \nIn 1994 the MD\u201fs mentor and co-owner of Sportasia died suddenly. When his widow elected to \nsell all but 5% of her 40% stake in the company, this presented the MD with an opportunity to \nenact his emerging philosophy. He offered the shares to the firm\u201fs staff. Later that year, a \nweekend workshop for all staff examined the organisational model that had been incrementally \nestablished. This produced the text of the company\u201fs first mission statement. The firm continued \nto reflect annually upon its culture, but business growth postponed a fuller appraisal until a \nseries of day-long staff workshops in 1998. In small cross-functional teams, facilitated by \ntrained supervisors, the workforce sought to encapsulate the company\u201fs beliefs and values into a \nmore expansive mission statement. It is noteworthy that the \u201eWe believe\u2026\u201f statement is wholly \nemployee-centric:  \n\u201cIt is the mission of Sportasia to offer people with shared goals and values, the \nopportunity for continued personal and professional development, by cultivating a caring \nand rewarding environment where people feel inspired, respected and appreciated.\u201d  \n \n 7 \nAnother \u201eDevelopment Day\u201f event in 1999, again involving the entire workforce, set out to \ncodify and institutionalise these cultural norms into a set of policies and practices for people \nmanagement. Following substantial workforce input into the first, and subsequent, drafts the \n\u201eCommunity Company model\u201f became the company\u201fs official philosophy in March 2000.  \n \nIn 2000 the company launched a mail order venture, selling its products direct to parents. This \nbrought the company into direct competition with huge suppliers of generic school wear such as \nthe major supermarket chains. After two years of losses, and pressure brought to bear on the \nDirectors by the workforce, who were losing large portions of their bonuses, the venture was \nregretfully abandoned. The failure proved a very stressful time, even a stern test for the firm\u201fs \nway of conducting itself. A handful of disaffected employees left, but those who stayed felt that \nthey had been kept informed openly and honestly about the venture, and in interview appeared \ndetermined that Sportasia would continue under a new strategy.  \n \nPartnership at Sportasia \u2013 policies and practices.  \nSportasia\u201fs model comprises six \u201epillars\u201f (Figure 1) embodying the principles enshrined in the \n\u201eWe believe\u2026\u201f mission statement. To each pillar is assigned a communitarian-style exchange of \n\u201erights\u201f with corresponding \u201eresponsibilities\u201f intended to provide mutually acceptable \n\u201cobligations\u201d between the company and the individual employee. These are enacted by the \ncompany\u201fs people management policies and practices. \n \nTAKE IN FIGURE 1 HERE \n \nThe firm\u201fs information-sharing covers \u201canything significant relating to the trading performance \nand financial prosperity of the company, together with any other items of general interest that \nmay impact positively on people\u201fs feelings of ownership and attachment to their company\u201d \n(Sportasia, 2000: 14-15), while consultation is defined as \u201cthe engagement of people in the \ndiscussions that take place about issues affecting the direction of their roles and the organisation \nas a whole\u201d (ibid). In practice, four consultative meetings take place every month sequentially. \nThe first, at the team level in different departments, are known as Action Groups. These mainly \ncover the team\u201fs operational issues, but also any company-wide matters requiring staff input. \nAccording to a Warehouse employee, \u201ceverything has to stop for these meetings, even at busy \ntimes\u201d.  The team leaders tend to facilitate these meetings, but the whole team is involved in the \ndiscussions. \u201eDepartmental\u201f meetings are scheduled a week later, and can last for half a day. \nThese discuss department-wide concerns, including any arising from the Action Groups. The \n\u201eManagers-Directors\u201f meeting follows the \u201eDepartmentals\u201f later in the month. Company-wide \nstrategic decisions tend to be formulated here first, although Action Groups and Departmentals \ncan put forward suggestions. Any significant proposals for improving performance or changes to \nemployment conditions are taken to the Action Groups for staff input prior to the final decision. \nThe \u201eManagers-Directors\u201f meeting also considers personnel issues from each department. \nFinally there is the \u201eFigures\u201f meeting, where the entire workforce (except the sales \nrepresentatives) hears about the firm\u201fs overall performance, projections, and strategic issues. As \nsuch, the management accounts are not shrouded in mystery and everybody has the opportunity \nto raise questions about them, or any other matters. In practice, shopfloor input here is limited, \nperhaps because the forum is so large, but also because the company clearly prefers the Action \nGroups as the most appropriate forum for staff input. To supplement communication the \ncompany produces a weekly A4 newsletter. There is also provision for ad hoc meetings, \nespecially for critical incidents.  \n \nThe firm\u201fs reward policy is set within the constraints of its twin core values. Thus, Sportasia \npays its staff a salary (rather than a weekly wage, or seasonal payments, as is common in the \nindustry). Individuals\u201f salary increases are set annually in the \u201eManagers-Directors\u201f meeting \n 8 \naccording to individualised performance appraisals, determined initially by the employee\u201fs line \nmanager and following an informal 360-degree review of the employee by her\/his work team. \nThe appraisal measures the employee\u201fs abilities and effort, but also their \u201cattitudes\u201d as derived \nfrom perceived compliance with the rights and responsibilities of the six \u201epillars\u201f. When asked \nto comment upon what might seem the paradox of a \u201ecommunity\u201f culture based on \u201ccollective \neffort\u201d that rewards people individually, the MD argued that the policy is \u201ca philosophical \nquestion of justice\u201d about how people should be rewarded: \u201cAcross-the-board increases are \ncompletely unfair and de-motivating, because it doesn\u201ft reward individuals\u201f own effort, and \ngoing the \u201eextra mile\u201f\u201d. He denied there was an inconsistency \u201cas long as it is kept within the \nrealms of decency\u201d. Large discrepancies in salary levels within a job group are held in check by \nsalary bands, and the highest salary earned cannot exceed 10 times that of the lowest paid \n(Sportasia, 2000: 51), while the senior managers\u201f collective judgement is felt to provide checks \nand balances against victimisation or favouritism.  \n \nBasic pay can be bolstered by an annual profit-sharing bonus in which each member below \nDirector level receives an even share of the allocated \u201epot\u201f regardless of status.3 Employees with \nmore than two years\u201f service are further entitled to buy shares in the company. The rationale for \nthis is \u201cabout offering people the opportunity to acquire a stake in their own future. Providing \npeople with a real opportunity to significantly impact their long-term financial security and well-\nbeing, directly, through their own efforts, both motivates and inspires\u201d (Sportasia, 2000: 35). \nMore than a third (37.8%) of the workforce owned Sportasia shares in July 2001, including \nalmost 29% of non-managerial employees.\n4\n When asked whether the firm had seen employee-\nowners seeking to exercise their ownership rights over company decision-making the MD \nreported none: \u201cBut the opportunity for that input is already there\u201d. The Personnel Director cited \nan emergency meeting of the firm\u201fs shareholders for which nobody turned up, several \nemployees telling him that they trusted the senior management to act in their best interests. A \nsickness absence bonus rewards 100% attendance with \u00a3100, and each day taken off removes \n\u00a320 from this total. With managers\u201f tacit approval employees use the firm\u201fs \u201etime banking\u201f \nsystem to protect this bonus.  \n \nThe most contentious \u201eflexibility\u201f obligation comes in the summer when extra weekend working \n(two Saturdays in June, July and August) is required of everyone, including the Managing \nDirector. The popular time banking system has helped smooth the process. In return, all those \nwith two continuous years\u201f service have a formal guarantee that they will not be subject to \ncompulsory redundancy. The rationale, within the \u201erights and responsibilities\u201f ethos, is that \n\u201cIf [employee X] has given their commitment, loyalty and dedication \u2013 and \u201etime served\u201f \nis a simplistic measure, but it\u201fs the best we can come up with - surely there is a right to \nsome security and peace of mind in return\u2026 After two years [here] you\u201fve earned that \nsecurity of mind\u201d (MD, interview).  \n \nProvisions for major programmes of redundancy are not set down in a written policy, as yet. But \nthe MD explained that the firm would \u201ctake every step before cutting the staff overhead cost\u201d, \nseeking volunteers first, then employees who had been with the firm less than two years (and \nhence are not covered by the guarantee), and finally across-the-board pay and benefits cuts.  \n \n                                                 \n3\n Based on turnover of \u00a35m a 10% bonus would mean a \u201epot\u201f to share of \u00a339,356; 5% would mean sharing \n\u00a314,363. 2001 saw around \u00a360,000 profits to share equally among the workforce.  \n \n4\n Appendices set out formal commitments on the percentage of shares to be offered to the workforce as the \ncompany\u201fs history lengthens: 5% by the firm\u201fs fifth birthday, 15% between 11-15 years of existence, to the eventual \ngoal of 20% after 16 years. \n 9 \nSportasia\u201fs managers lay great store by staff development. Each employee is entitled to two \nappraisal interviews per year, which focus on developmental needs and opportunities within the \nemployee\u201fs own role, their department or through internal transfers. The company promises \n\u201cappropriate support and training\u201d, subject to budgetary consequences and the requirements of \nthe community. For example, some embroiderers travelled to Germany for direct instruction on \nthe maintenance of the machines, thereby improving their skills and saving the company money \nat the same time. A warehouse employee, who had started work as a \u201ecasual\u201f, said: \u201csince I have \nbeen here [less than 12 months], I\u201fve had more training and development than I\u201fd had in twelve \nyears previously\u201d. In-house training courses cover a wide range of operational and behavioural \nareas, including \u201eConflict Management\u201f, \u201eDecision-Making\u201f, \u201eManaging Meetings\u201f, \u201eCoaching \nSkills\u201f, Kolb\u201fs \u201elearning cycle\u201f and \u201eOperational and Strategic Planning\u201f.  \n \nThere is also what might be termed a programme of \u201ecultural education\u201f. This includes the bi-\nannual company-wide \u201eDevelopment Days\u201f, company trips and social events and a programme \nof seven voluntary \u201ecommunity classes\u201f in which employees can learn more about the \nphilosophy behind the firm\u201fs practices. The classes would seem to be popular and worthwhile if \nmeasured by employee participation rates, which have risen year on year.  \n \nImportantly, these arrangements are not a \u201cfragile, \u201epure\u201f co-operation or consultation process, \nultimately at managerial discretion\u201d (Terry, 1999: 28). The structures and policies are \ninstitutionalised in the firm\u201fs constitution, which commits the company to operate according to \nthese principles (76% of the shareholders are needed to amend the constitution), and a legally-\nbinding agreement to abide by the model\u201fs strictures is written into the terms of the employment \ncontract. (These have never been tested in an employment tribunal, but the firm\u201fs lawyers are \nconfident that they are legally enforceable.) As such Sportasia\u201fs arrangements fulfil Hammer\u201fs \ncall for \u201cthe public availability of as much detailed information about the mutual rights and \nobligations in an employment relationship as the employer is capable of committing to writing\u201d \n(2000: 191).  \n \nSportasia - why no trade union? \nThe MD explained his attitude toward trade unions thus:  \n\u201cA trade union as a body representative of a large section of the workforce is entirely \ninconsistent with the community model\u2026 Something has gone wrong if in the structures \nthere is a polarisation of needs to the degree that external intervention is required. If the \npower to effect change in a meaningful manner is already invested in individuals, and the \norganisation\u201fs structures and constitutions are set up to reflect this, then I struggle to see \na meaningful role for a trade union\u201d.  \n \nA Personnel officer argued that trade union intervention would be \n\u201ca sign of failure\u2026 Confrontation and third parties are unnecessary. Conflicts can be \nresolved without them. If the culture is right for open and honest dialogue there is no \nneed for third party representation\u2026 and you are very likely to be listened to here [over, \nfor example, pay issues]\u201d.  \n \nFor the Personnel Director collective bargaining was an \u201canathema\u201d because he felt it almost \nnever accommodates individualised performance-related pay.  \n \nNo non-managerial employee interviewed expressed any desire for a union presence; when \nasked, none could see a role for a trade union. One shopfloor employee felt that a union \n\u201cwouldn\u201ft work here. There are all sorts of safeguards in place. We are free to discuss things \nwith our line manager. A trade union might jump in\u2026\u201d Another attributed the lack of a divide \n 10 \nalong them-and-us lines to the extent of employee involvement. However, the MD insisted that \nhe would be happy to accept a trade union presence if the \u201ecommunity\u201f felt that one was needed.5 \n  \nIs Sportasia an example of partnership? \nReturning to the six essential components of a partnership organisation outlined above, the firm \nis transparently run on the basis of securing collectively-determined success, and for building a \npositive, trust-based working environment (elements 1 and 3). The Sportasia model has rather \nless to say, however, on the principle that the legitimate and separate roles and interests of the \nparties be mutually recognised and accepted. Indeed, the firm\u201fs management use strongly \nunitarist language to describe Sportasia. In interview, the MD acknowledged the probability that \nsuch potential conflict exists in \u201cmost organisations to different degrees\u201d, but he insisted that \nSportasia\u201fs community vision and \u201epillars\u201f have been designed, in part, to align and then \nmanage both sets of interests for mutual benefit: accept and enact the required behaviours, and \nthe conflict can be (as good as) eliminated, he argued. The Personnel Director elaborated, \ndrawing on his admiration for William Glasser\u201fs work on psychological needs (Glasser, 1998): \n\u201c\u2026 If [the needs to belong, for fun, for excellence for freedom, for responsibility, and \nfor power, cf. Glasser] do underpin what people want from life, our raison d\u201f\u00eatre [as a \nfirm] is helping our staff meet those needs... If you do that, you can\u201ft help but succeed, \nbecause people want to come to work and be part of the community, although it\u201fs fair to \nsay there are some needs profiles we meet more effectively than others\u201d. \n \nIf anything, the firm\u201fs extensive focus on satisfying employees\u201f interests point to a \n\u201esophisticated paternalism\u201f (cf. Purcell, 1987), one in which the interests of the employer (i.e. \nefficiencies, productivity improvements, profitability) are notably downplayed. \n \nOn the crucial element of joint problem-solving to meditate between these potentially divergent \ninterests, the general impression gathered from our interviews is that, while senior management \ntake or endorse Sportasia\u201fs strategic decisions, mechanisms do exist both formally and \ninformally for all employees to influence significantly the process and final outcome, and they \nare arrangements with which the vast majority of Sportasia\u201fs employees are satisfied. Most non-\nmanagerial staff interviewed felt that they had \u201ca lot\u201d of opportunities for input, and this was \n\u201cvery good\u201d; it made one \u201cfeel valued\u201d. Describing the consultative process in the Action \nGroups, a Warehouse supervisor felt the meetings enable \u201cpeople to look at various options\u2026 \n[Management] don\u201ft just dismiss ideas saying, \u201eyou\u201fll do it my way\u201f, we talk to each other and \nwork things out\u201d. However, a few questioned whether the senior management team always \nresponded adequately to suggestions from staff. One thought it \u201can ideal\u201d not always fully \nrealised. (For examples, see the footnote at the end of this paragraph.)\n \nThe Personnel Director \nnoted that non-managerial employee input tends to be keenest within the Action Groups and the \nDepartmentals: \u201cEmployees are reasonably interested, but it\u201fs the local issues that get the most \nresponse\u201d. This echoes Wall and Lischeron\u201fs point (1977, cited in Blyton and Turnbull, 1994: \n213) that issues directly affecting people\u201fs working experience tend to most exercise the minds \nof non-managerial employees.\n6\n  \n                                                 \n5\n A trade union official has visited the site once when an employee asked to be accompanied at a disciplinary \nhearing. From the MD\u201fs account of the incident, it seems that the official could find little fault with the firm\u201fs \nprocesses, and \u201csaid, \u201egosh, what a nice company\u201f.\u201d \n6\n Perhaps the two most compelling examples of staff influence on strategic decision-making are the constitution \nitself, and the pressure brought to bear on the ill-fated School Trends Plus venture. Other examples cited by staff of \ntheir influence over company-level policy included amendments to both the profit-sharing bonus scheme and the \ntime banking system after Action Groups \u201cfound holes\u201d in the Directors\u201f original ideas. Given a set of options for \ncompany policy on retirement age, consultation with the Action Groups revealed a preference for 65 over 60; this \nwas adopted shortly afterwards. A sales administrator looked back over her two years with the firm, and could not \nthink of a decision she thought had been unfair, or that she hadn\u201ft agreed with. At the more local level the \nwarehouse Action Group adapted its invoicing processes to save \u00a38,000 in postage, and also came up with their \n 11 \n \nCategorising the extent of employee involvement in decision-making within Sportasia is \nsomewhat problematic. Using Dundon and colleagues\u201f terminology on employee voice \nprovisions (Dundon et al., 2004), Sportasia\u201fs arrangements appear to the respondents, and to us, \nto embody both a \u201econtribution to decision-making\u201f and a \u201edemonstration of mutuality and co-\noperative relations\u201f, while they best match the \u201eproblem solving over shared objectives\u201f \ncategory in Terry\u201fs two-fold typology of non-union forms of collective employee representation \n(1999: 17), in which employees enjoy \u201eco-operation rights\u201f \u201cto information, to protest, to \nsuggest and be consulted\u201d rather more than Terry\u201fs alternative system, \u201ebargaining over \ndivergent objectives\u201f. But on some issues the employees do appear to have enjoyed the latter\u201fs \nrights \u201cto veto, co-decision and decision\u201d (Terry, ibid), notably over the constitution itself. \nFinally, in relation to Marchington and Wilkinson\u201fs \u201eescalator\u201f of employee involvement \n(2000), the structures are clearly \u201econsultative\u201f, and there is some evidence of occasional \u201eco-\ndetermination\u201f, but a few non-managerial employees\u201f assessments did suggest the reality could \nat times be management-dominated. Overall, however, there is a strong feeling of genuine \nshared decision-making. \n \nSportasia has policies that satisfy the trade-off of employment security in exchange for flexible \nworking practices, as it has for sharing success. However, in basic pay terms the Personnel team \nconcedes that Sportasia \u201cunderpays\u201d some staff, if benchmarked against comparable local firms. \n(Interestingly, this is especially the case for its managers, who earn considerably less than they \nmight do elsewhere.) In 2001 all non-managerial employees were paid above the minimum \nwage, and the company was confident that it pays above the market median within the (low-\npaying) clothing and textiles industries. None were earning less than \u00a310,000p.a. For this case \nstudy no employee complained about his\/ her basic salary package.  \n \nWith these policies and practices verifiably in place, there seems little scope to refute \nSportasia\u201fs claim \u2013 were they keen to make it themselves \u2013 to being a genuine \u201epartnership\u201f \norganisation. In common with other non-union examples, they do not use the term themselves \n(see IRS, 2000; Knell, 1999). Moreover, Sportasia would also appear to meet Haynes and \nAllen\u201fs (2001: 181) three requirements for an enduring partnership (in their study, between \nunions and management), namely mutual legitimation of sometimes differing interests, trust-\ninspired clarification of partners\u201f different roles and behaviour, and the delivery of tangible, \nmutually beneficial outcomes arising from the co-operative arrangements. Finally, according to \nKelly\u201fs two categorisations of [unionised] partnership arrangements (2004: 271), Sportasia does \nnot appear to fit the description of an \u201eemployer-dominant\u201f model (in which employees comply \nwith the employer\u201fs agenda, rather than co-operate actively) - although we can imagine that \nKelly might classify all non-unionised firms under this category - but nor is it an example of \n\u201elabour parity\u201f (a more or less even balance of power).  \n \nThe firm\u201fs arrangements do seem then to provide the basis for a mutually beneficial \nemployment relationship, and one which, to a significant extent, has been, and is, shaped by \nmanagers and the workforce in a joint process. However, it is not the case that all conflict has \nbeen eradicated. Drawing on our interviews with our shopfloor respondents we discuss this \nbelow. \n \nWorking in a non-union partnership: the employees\u201f experience.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                            \nown system for locating boxes for despatch among the several thousand stored. A new recruit to the Embroidery \ndepartment explained how she had suggested changes to shift patterns in her Action Group, and that this would be \nput to senior management. \n 12 \nAll interviewees acknowledged that the company does operate in the way described in the \ncommunity company model. All described a positive, friendly, respectful and largely egalitarian \nwork environment. Most tended to identify with the firm\u201fs espoused \u201ecommunity\u201f values and, \nwhen asked why the company is successful, most pointed to those same institutionalised \nprocesses and cultural norms. When asked to explain the model (i.e. the six \u201epillars\u201f), most \ninterviewees were able to provide a sketch, if not quite a word-perfect recitation. \nUnsurprisingly, after the two main authors (the MD and Personnel Director), other managers \nand the Personnel support team proved most effusive. The pillars \u201cunderpin the whole model\u201d \n(Finance Director); they are \u201cthe glue that holds us all together\u2026 a sort of moral code\u201d \n(Personnel officer); \u201cit lives on an everyday basis\u201d (Production Director).  \n \nSuch enthusiasm among managers is to be expected. Managers are typically more inclined to \nengage with matters of culture and organisational design, and at Sportasia they have been \nrecruited, in part, for their interest and enthusiasm for such matters. What of non-managerial \nstaff? Every shopfloor\/ administrative employee interviewed agreed that the \u201epillars\u201f are \nreasonable and make sense to them. They are, for one sales employee, \u201cprobably totally\u201d \nresponsible for the culture engendered, one she described as a \u201ccaring, rewarding, and inspiring \nenvironment\u201d. An embroiderer did not regard the pillars as \u201cjust a piece of writing. The \nphilosophy is for a nice working environment, and putting it into practice\u201d. A warehouse worker \ncalled it \u201ca very positive way of running a business\u201d. A production supervisor enthused, \u201cit\u201fs \nfantastic\u2026 When I read it and went to [the training and classes] it really made sense to me\u2026 \nYou can\u201ft go wrong with it\u201d. Another production worker described it as \u201ccommon sense, and in \npractice it\u201fs brilliant. 98% of the time it works\u201d - the other 2% he attributed to individual \nreactions to frustrations. Nobody objected to the model, although one admin officer felt that, \ndespite the ambitions toward workplace democracy, much of the real power still resides firmly \nwith the managers.  \n \nSportasia\u201fs stringent set of values requires significant staff \u201ebuy-in\u201f. This begins with the \nrecruitment process which, in effect, controls access to community membership through a \nbattery of tests for \u201ecultural fit\u201f. The rationale is that if new members join who are inappropriate, \nor who may prove disruptive or cynical, this could damage the coherence of the community and \nundermine the strength of its behavioural norms; it is easier to train and retrain people to do \nparticular jobs than it is to change their values and beliefs. Hence, a demanding two-stage \nselection interview has the candidate discuss her\/his motivations at work and in life, and overall \ncompatibility with the firm\u201fs \u201ecommunity\u201f ethos and its implied attitudes and behaviours \n(including what a member of Personnel called her\/his \u201cemotional resilience\u201d). The incompatible \ntend to \u201cde-select themselves\u201d, in the company\u201fs phrase, either during the interview or the six-\nmonth probationary period. One could argue that this process serves to secure a non-radicalised \nworkforce, since it would be expected to screen out personalities inclined toward \u201ethem-and-us\u201f \nperspectives on the employment relationship.  \n \nThe induction involves time spent in every functional department, together with participation in \nthe \u201ecultural education\u201f schemes. These schemes are designed \u201cto protect, evolve and develop \nthe culture\u2026 The more [educational, social and cultural] work is done the healthier the company \nbecomes\u201d (MD: interview). In this respect, Sportasia uses completion of the classes as a pre-\nrequisite for promotion to management positions. Intensive personal contact between managers\/ \nsupervisors and their team members also sustains (and in part, monitors) adherence to the \ncompany\u201fs values. \n \nAn interesting finding, then, is that depth of conviction and \u201ebuy-in\u201f to the community values \nvaries within the workforce. The Personnel Director estimated that \u201c80%-plus share the \ncompany\u201fs values\u201d, and those for whom the values have been internalised \u201ccan see why when \n 13 \nthey\u201fre challenged on contrary attitudes and behaviours\u201d. However, \u201conly one or two visibly \nstruggle [with the culture], because [the values] have not been internalised\u2026 They know what is \nexpected, but they don\u201ft believe it, and so you can see them constantly trying to display the \nappropriate behaviours\u201d.  \n \nHow does the company deal with inevitable outbreaks of dissent, or conflict of interest? The \ncommunity model places clear bounds around what is acceptable behaviour at work; the \u201erights \nand responsibilities\u201f model is the company\u201fs ethics of conduct. From the management\u201fs point of \nview, it has been designed as a written psychological contract with each member that is \nunderstood by all and applied equally to all. Moreover, given that each member has subscribed \nto its terms, and that it was designed jointly by the workforce and management, it should (in \ntheory, at least) be supported by all. When individuals\u201f so-called \u201cdamaging behaviours\u201d \ndiverge from the model, managers and supervisors, and even shopfloor employees, find the \nmodel\u201fs values a useful restraining tool: a \u201cnormative control mechanism\u201d, in Kunda\u201fs (1992) \nterm. A Personnel officer described how: \u201cYou can take people back to the pillars and say \n\u201eyou\u201fre not doing that\u201f [pointing to one of the pillars] or \u201eWhat is the consequence to the \ncommunity of your behaviour?\u201f\u201d  \n \nYet paradoxically, the firm\u201fs campaign to instil in its workforce commitment to cultural \nstrictures is a rare source of conflict between the managers and a number of those on the \n\u201eshopfloor\u201f. Some expressed reservations about the strict adherence required: \u201cThe \u201eculture and \ncommunity\u201f bit is a bit brainwashy\u2026 they feel we should all be the same, but we have different \npersonalities and different reactions\u201d. Another felt, \u201cin some ways we are acting a part, I mean, \nwe have a \u201escript\u201f\u2026\u201d Another admitted that there are several \u201cMr and Mrs Sportasia\u201fs. Some \nput on a face in front of certain people\u201d. Others felt free to ignore much of the cultural \nrequirements of the job. One otherwise enthusiastic production employee admitted that they \nwere \u201ca load of nonsense\u2026 I take it as it comes, and don\u201ft bother about it\u201d. A colleague\u201fs \nattitude was similar: \u201cI don\u201ft think about [the culture], I just come and get on with it. But you \ndon\u201ft have to throw yourself into it. You can be an interested onlooker\u201d. This does lend \ncredence to the MD\u201fs claim that while compliance is demanded, full immersion is voluntary.  \n \nWhen conflicts do occur they appear to centre on disputed interpretations about whether the \nincident constitutes a violation of the community\u201fs code of conduct. The company\u201fs default \nresponse is to view conflict as \u201chuman error\u201d and therefore a training issue rather than a \ndisciplinary matter. However, some managers wondered aloud whether the firm is too tolerant at \ntimes, too keen to pursue joint problem solving, to \u201ccoach people through it\u201d (Production \nDirector: interview). By contrast, one or two non-managerial employees recounted minor \nincidents when managers\u201f reaction to \u201enon-compliance\u201f seemed harsh. The MD views the firm\u201fs \nreluctance to resort to its formal disciplinary procedures as a sign of the community\u201fs strength.  \n \nThe paradox is that the firm may be expending unnecessary energies on its cultural education \nprogrammes, when what its workforce values above all is the management team\u201fs consistency \nof attitudes, behaviours and treatment, thoughtfulness, support and benevolence. (One \ninterviewee saw with the failure of the mail order venture another potential weakness with the \n\u201ecultural fit\u201f fixation: that it may detract Sportasia from hiring and developing appropriate \nspecialist expertise and skills for future requirements.) \n \nEmployee turnover, running at around 10-15% overall, breaks down interestingly according to \ntime served. It is \u201cquite high\u201d during the first six months as some new recruits struggle to adapt, \nbut thereafter, and especially after two years\u201f service \u2013 when among other things the \nemployment security guarantee comes into effect \u2013 employee turnover is \u201cvery low\u201d. Few of the \nlong-serving employees interviewed contemplate ever leaving. As one Director noted, \u201cthe \n 14 \ncloser you are to owning the values, the less [the requirement to comply] restricts your \nbehaviours\u201d. \n \nConclusion. \nThis paper has explored issues surrounding non-unionised forms of partnership. We have argued \nthat if one considers the partnership relationship to be primarily between the organisation\u201fs \nmanagement team and the workforce, and if one allows for flexibility of interpretation on means \nfor employees\u201f input into decision-making to accommodate forms other than the indirect \nchannel provided by trade unions (i.e. works councils and staff forums, etc - as is, of course, the \ncase in much of continental Europe), then non-union forms can exist.  \n \nBased on our in-depth study we would argue that Sportasia is a genuine example \u2013 relatively \nminor caveats about the occasionally overbearing cultural indoctrination, seasonal variations in \nworkload and a few examples of \u201eunder-paying\u201f notwithstanding. Moreover, it has proven its \nadaptability and sustainability over 16 years. The case is interesting as a successful example of \npartnership working effectively and popularly, if not always perfectly, without the presence of a \ntrade union. In other studies, Knell (1999) found negligible differences between his non-\nunionised and unionised cases for the DTI, while IRS researchers have even suggested that non-\nunion forms are often \u201cmore developed and deeper-rooted\u201d (IRS, 2000: 39). One hope is that \nwider awareness of non-union examples might extend the \u201epartnership\u201f agenda beyond the \nconfines of its current \u201eunion-only ghetto\u201f. A challenge for trade unions facing people \nmanagement strategies such as Sportasia\u201fs is to demonstrate their so-called \u201evalue-addedness\u201f \n(on this see Terry, 1999: 28). One consolation is that such firms are extremely rare.  \n \nFinally, we would argue that the litmus-test for all partnerships - unionised or not - is the quality \nof the joint problem solving processes in the terms we suggested earlier: of giving significant \ninfluence to employees over organizational decision-making early in the process (Haynes & \nAllen, 2001: 181), and in delivering regular, acceptable mutual gains for all parties. Research \ninto non-union forms of consultation tends to portray such forums as toothless (Blyton & \nTurnbull, 1994; Gollan, 2001; Hammer, 2000; Terry, 1999). However, employees\u201f responses to \nthe WERS98 survey (Millward et al., 2000: 129, cited in Gollan, 2001) suggested that non-\nunion consultation was generally considered effective in keeping employees up-to-date with \nproposed changes and in enhancing managerial responsiveness to specific employee concerns, \nbut less effective than unionised arrangements in promoting fair treatment for employees in \ngeneral. That said, Freeman and Medoff (1984) have argued that the efficacy of employee voice \ndepends ultimately on the way in which employees and managers interact: the process and \nconduct of the joint problem-solving. McLoughlin and Gourlay\u201fs studies (1992, 1994) into 115 \n\u201ehigh-tech\u201f firms in the South East (80% of which were non-unionised) found that the absence \nof a trade union channel could be largely off-set by the adoption of alternative \u201ccollective voice \nmechanisms\u201d for representation of employees\u201f interests (such as works councils), and by \n\u201cinformal, non-institutional individual voice mechanisms\u201d (1992: 673). The firms in their \nsample that married a high strategic integration of HRM practices with a strong emphasis on \n\u201cindividualist\u201d means of governing the employment relationship tended to report having single-\nstatus terms and conditions, profit-sharing and\/or employee share ownership, pay linked to \nappraisal and \u201crelatively sophisticated\u201d means for individual employees to provide input into \norganisational decision-making (1992: 679). Such a firm \u2013 with employment security provisions \ntoo - would fall under the definition of \u201epartnership\u201f outlined above. Moreover, these \narrangements resemble closely those within Sportasia. Future research might build on Kelly\u201fs \n(2004) research into partnership and non-partnership firms, comparing paired unionised and \nnon-unionised partnership organizations across a range of organizational and employee \noutcomes.  \n \n 15 \nWith trade union density in the private sector at just 11% (Taylor, 2001: 13), and the imminent \nimpact of the EC\u201fs Information and Consultation Directive (which will eventually require \nundertakings employing more than 50 persons to inform and consult their staff across a broad \nrange of work-related issues), more research is clearly needed into people management in non-\nunion settings. This paper is part of an ongoing longitudinal study of one particularly curious \nand, we believe, admirable firm. \n \nAcknowledgements. \nThe authors wish to thank the Managing Director, Peter Beeby, and everyone at Sportasia for \ntheir co-operation in this research, as well as Anne Keegan and Elaine Farndale for helpful \nfeedback on earlier drafts. \n 16 \nFIGURES. \n \n \nFigure 1:  Sportasia \u201epillars\u201f, rights and responsibilities.  \n \nPILLAR RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES \nInformation and \ninvolvement \nAccess to information and \ninvolvement in decision-making \nOpen and honest participation \nFair reward Fair reward, avoiding indecent \nsalary differentials \nHonest endeavour and commitment \nShared prosperity Shared prosperity through profit-\nsharing and share ownership \nFull contribution to the community \neffort \nEmployment \nprotection \nEmployment protection Flexibility and adaptability \nApplication of \norganisational \nvalues \nTo be treated with fairness, \nconsistency, respect and support \nProtection and enhancement of the \ncommunity by showing fairness, \nconsistency, respect and support \nDevelopment \nopportunities \nTraining and opportunities for \ndevelopment \nCommitment to meeting training \nobjectives and to developing in \nharmony with the needs of the \ncommunity \n \n \n \n \nAPPENDIX: List of interviewees by job grade (number of separate interviews in \nbrackets). \n \nSENIOR MANAGEMENT \nNumber of interviewees: 6  \nNumber of interviews: 13. \n\u2018SHOP FLOOR\u2019 \nEMPLOYEES  \nNumber of interviewees: 14  \nNumber of interviews: 14. \nOTHERS \nNumber of interviewees: 9  \nNumber of interviews: 11. \nManaging Director (4x) \nHR\/ Operations Director (3x) \nProduction Director (3x) \nFinance Director (1x) \nSales & Marketing Director \n(1x) \nPurchasing Director (1x) \n8 production employees \n6 administrative employees \nPersonnel Manager (2x) \nPersonnel Officer (1x) \nSales Manager (1x) \nSales Representative (1x) \nWarehouse Manager (2x) \nSenior Operations Officer (1x) \n3 Team Leaders (2 production, 1 \ntelemarketing)  \n \n \n 17 \nREFERENCES. \n \nACAS.
