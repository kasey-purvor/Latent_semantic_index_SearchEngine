Introduction \n \nA single approach with high sensitivity and specificity that can effectively and non-\ndestructively screen volumes for illicit materials is yet to be adopted by the security \nindustry.  Materials that need to be identified include concealed explosives and controlled \nsubstances. Explosives are considered by many authors to be the most severe threat to \nairport security [1], and their perceived presence has placed an unprecedented moral and \neconomic burden on the aviation industry.  In the long term the illegal trafficking of \ncontrolled substances through the postal system (both domestically and internationally) \ncan be considered equally as detrimental to society.  \n \nX-ray diffraction has been shown to be an effective probe for detecting both concealed \nexplosives [2,3,4,5]  and controlled substances [6,7,8,9]. These materials are generally of \na crystalline nature and therefore produce characteristic diffraction maxima likened to \n\u201cfingerprints\u201d by some authors [6]. The majority of these proposed screening systems use \n*Revised Manuscript\nPage 2 of 17\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nan energy dispersive method whereby characteristic X-ray spectra are obtained from \nindividual locations within the inspection volume that is illuminated with a broad-band of \nradiation. Generally a sophisticated set of collimators which restrict the direction of the \nincident and diffracted rays is required to ensure that the origin of the scattered radiation \n(sample position) is well defined. This collimation impinges on the system sensitivity and \ncan result in as much as a 99% loss of the scattered beam flux [4]. \n \nWe have been investigating a new approach which uses an angular dispersive method \n[10] due to its superior resolution [7]. The majority of angular dispersive systems also \nrely on a known sample position to correctly interpret the diffraction pattern. We have \nbeen investigating a new technique which determines the sample location without the use \nof collimation. This has the capacity to speed up screening times as a whole depth \ndimension can be evaluated simultaneously. Efforts have also been made to consider the \nimpact of sample thickness, which is known to be problematic in transmission mode \n[8,10]. This preliminary study demonstrates a small scale system that utilises \nmolybdenum radiation. The penetrating ability of this radiation is at the lower limit for \nletter or parcel screening and certainly too low to penetrate a full suitcase. Typically for \nhigher penetration imaging, airports may employ a tungsten target with a characteristic \nline at approximately 59 keV. This radiation comes with a penalty of increased \nBremsstrahlung.  However the use of appropriate K edge filtration would mitigate against \nthis effect and so theoretically the techniques presented here could be used with tungsten \nradiation in a scaled up version. K edge filtration would also come with the additional \nbenefit that it will improve the image quality of transmission based imaging systems..  \n \n1.1 Principles of X-ray diffraction \n \nThe majority of illicit materials such as explosives and drugs are polycrystalline and so a \npowder diffraction model has been adopted. Diffraction maxima occur when a mono-\nenergetic X-ray beam strikes a crystalline material (or any material exhibiting long range \norder) at a specific angle of incidence. Constructive and destructive interference effects \nresult in radiation being scattered at characteristic angles [11]. These are directly related \nto the differing interplanar spacings within the material. This relationship is governed by \nBraggs law,  \n \n\u03bb = 2dsin\u03b8     (1) \n \nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the radiation used, d is the interplanar spacing within the \nmaterial and 2\u03b8 is the angle through which the radiation is scattered relative to the \nincident beam direction. Thus if monochromatic radiation is used and the angle of scatter \nfor any Bragg peak measured, then the interplanar spacings (characteristic of material) \ncan be determined.  Clearly the sample position relative to the detector is a critical factor \nfor calculating the angle of scatter in most experimental systems. We have been \ndeveloping a new approach which does not require a prior knowledge of sample position. \n \n \n \nPage 3 of 17\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n1.2  Rationale \n \nConsider a diffraction pattern consisting of multiple diffraction maxima collected on a \nplanar detector arranged normal to the incident beam (see figure 1). Translating the \ndetector along the primary beam, will result in the Bragg maxima striking the detector at \ndifferent locations i.e. the radius of the Debye cones` projection onto the detector (H) will \nchange.  The angle of scatter for each Bragg peak can thus be calculated from,   \n \ndH\/dP = tan 2\u03b8    (2) \n \nwhere P is the sample to detector distance.  Therefore, by measuring the rate at which the \nradius changes as the sample to detector distance is changed, it is possible to determine \nboth the scatter angle and the sample position (relative to the detector) simultaneously. \nIn principle then a minimum of two diffraction patterns need be measured in order to \ndetermine both 2\u03b8 and the sample position. However in practice this is not possible, \nparticularly in the case of measured diffraction patterns consisting of multiple Bragg \npeaks as there is no reliable coincidence information that can be used to identify the \ncommon maxima between each pattern. We have developed a method for correctly \nidentifying such corresponding Bragg peaks (\"peak tracking\") and this is discussed \nbelow. It should be noted that peak amplitude is an unreliable characteristic to exploit in \nthis context due to multiple factors affecting peak heights (e.g. overlapping maxima). \n \n1.3 Peak Tracking \n \nWith no coincidence information, and assuming that all diffraction maxima (n)  measured \nat one detector position are also observed at a second position, the number of possible \nBragg peaks that could have created peaks in the observed detector positions ranges from \n(n (n + 1)\/2) to n\n2 \n. Only a proportion of these Bragg peak possibilities will be correct. It \nis evident that for scenarios where n is large the proportion of correct Bragg peak \npossibilities to false will diminish. Our approach to identify corresponding diffraction \nmaxima uses equation (2) applied to diffraction data collected from multiple (>2) detector \npositions.  The positions of any maxima are linearly related through the detector \npositions.  Thus determining those peak positions which possess a fixed gradient when \nplotted against detector position enables coincidence grouping of the peaks. A correct d-\nspacing and source position may then be determined. \n \nFor non-ideal conditions (e.g. where diffraction peaks have a finite width and thus peak \noverlapping is more frequent), a greater number of detector positions may be required. \nThe inclusion of additional detector positions will increase the specificity of the system, \nhowever it will also warrant either a higher associated system cost (for the additional \ndetectors) or an extra time constraint (where the detector is moved to different positions). \nWe have found that four detector positions will eliminate enough false Bragg peaks to \ndifferentiate simple volumes containing few materials. For complex volumes that contain \n>5 materials with low symmetry the technique may require more than four detector \npositions to achieve high levels of sensitivity (true positive rate) and 1-specificity (false \npositive rate).  \nPage 4 of 17\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n2. Method \n \n2.1 Simulation \n \nA simulation was created in Matlab\u00ae to demonstrate the premise of the peak tracking \nmethod and to aid in selecting possible configurations prior to experimental tests. A \nnumber of materials of a chosen thickness (elongation) were randomly assigned a \nposition along the X-ray beam path within a boundary representing an imaginary \ninspection volume. The diffraction patterns for each material were then projected onto \ndetectors at specified distances and linearly summed. It should be noted that the projected \npattern from each material contributed equally to the resulting patterns at each detector \nposition and no allowances for the scattering cross sections of the materials, re-absorption \neffects or preferred orientation were made. However, these factors only affect peak \namplitude not position. Each of the 1D patterns were smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay \nfilter, normalised and then a modified first differential was applied to provide a robust \npeak finder in the presence of noise. Finally, each pattern was evaluated to find potential \ncorrect 2\u03b8 solutions and their associated position on the primary X-ray beam path, the \nresult of which is reported in section 3.1.1. \n \nTo test the robustness of the system a mixture of illicit material diffractograms (e.g. TNT, \nPETN) were evaluated in the presence of those from benign materials (e.g. talcum \npowder, sucrose). The diffraction patterns produced by the peak tracking method were \nchecked by a simple algorithm that searched a limited threat database of diffraction \npatterns to determine if an illicit material was present. Receiver operator characteristic \n(ROC) curves were created to compare the true positive (sensitivity) and false positive (1 \n\u2013 specificity) rates. This demonstrates how often threats were correctly identified and \nhow often benign materials are identified as a threat (false alarm) respectively. The \nnumber of Bragg peaks matching those of a threat material was used as the discriminating \nthreshold to produce the ROC. A summary of these results can be found in sections 3.1.2 \nand 3.1.3. The reader may be interested in the false negative rate (e.g. how often the \nsystem fails to identify a threat). This is 1 \u2013 true positive rate.  \n \n2.2 Experimental parameters \n \nWe have undertaken a systematic series of experiments incorporating samples placed at \ndifferent distances from a detector and resultant diffraction patterns collected at \nincreasing sample to detector distances. The X-rays were produced by a Philips PW1830 \nX-ray generator incorporating a sealed, long fine focus X-ray tube with a molybdenum \ntarget. The accelerating voltage and current were 40kV and 30mA respectively. A PIXIS \n1024x1024 16bit CCD camera with a phosphor screen was used in a raster scan mode to \ncollect the scattered photons. A 4mm thick brass plate with 0.66mm diameter aperture \nwas used to collimate the primary X-ray beam into a pencil beam. Finally, a set of \nThorlab stages were used to translate the detector along the primary beam path. \n \n \n \nPage 5 of 17\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n2.3 Materials \n \nIn the example shown in section 3.2, sheet aluminium (approximately 0.2mm thick) and \naluminium oxide (approximately 0.1mm thick) were used as they present characteristic \ndiffraction maxima over a typical angular range. Relatively thin samples were chosen due \nto the low energy X-rays employed as well as its subsequent affect on Bragg maxima \nwidth (presented in section 3.1.2 and discussed in section 4). In addition, these two \nmaterials are chosen as it would be difficult to differentiate between them by applying \nelemental techniques, which helps to demonstrate the specificity achievable with a scatter \nbased system.  \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1 Simulations \n \n3.1.1 The premise \n \nFigure 2 illustrates the simulated patterns created from a spatially separated mixture of \ntrinitrotoluene (TNT) and talcum powder (each at 0.1 mm elongation) when viewed at \ndiffering detector positions. The change in peak position (\u0394H) is a function of 2\u03b8 and the \nmaterials\u2019 position along the primary X-ray beam path. Applying the peak tracking \nmethod described in section 1.3 results in many possible calculated 2\u03b8 values and \npositions. Two of these groups of Bragg peaks are demonstrated in figures 3 and 4. The \npeak positions were a good match to those of standard TNT and talcum powder proving \nto be the most likely candidate as determined by a conventional diffraction matching \nalgorithm (Crystallographica Search-Match\u00ae) that searched approximately 200,000 \ndiffraction patterns. Thus, from a mixture of diffraction patterns arising from differing \nsample positions, the algorithm was capable of discriminating between materials and \nlocating their relative positions with respect to the detector. \n \n3.1.2 Effect of elongated samples \n \nThe peak tracking method is dependent upon the algorithm\u2019s ability to correctly identify \npeak positions at the detector. When samples are elongated along the primary beam axis \nthe diffraction patterns, when collected in transmission mode, are known to be \nproblematic. This is because broadening in the diffraction maxima caused by scattering \nfrom the front surface right through to the back surface of the sample is observed [10]. \nThis reduces the precision in peak location and increases the overlapping likelihood. \nFigure 5A illustrates the change in shape of an ROC curve as the samples under \ninspection are elongated. Each individual simulation contained two materials (chosen at \nrandom from a small reference library of benign and illicit materials) at a specified \nelongation assigned to a random location within the inspection volume. Theoretical \ndetectors were placed at 210, 220, 230 and 240 mm from the source. The ROC curve \ndemonstrates the systems ability to reliably identify a threat material. The number of \npeaks required to identify the threat was used as the discriminating threshold. The \nPage 6 of 17\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\nsimulation was repeated approximately one thousand times. The results of this simulation \nare discussed in section 4.0.  \n \n3.1.3 Effect of detector distance  \n \nIncreasing the sample to detector distance could mitigate against the reduced resolution \noffered by elongated samples. This is because the concomitant increase in relative \ndiffraction peak width would be less than that of the corresponding positional change. \nSimilarly to figure 5A (described in section 3.1.2), figure 5B illustrates an ROC surface \nwith the same simulation settings except the detector distances were increased from 210, \n220, 230 and 240 mm to 220, 240, 260 and 280 mm. The change in volume bounded by \nthe surface is discussed in section 4.0. \n \n3.2 Experimental proof of principle \n \nTo evaluate the methods empirically sheets of aluminium and aluminium oxide were \nplaced at different locations along the primary beam path to simulate objects at differing \nlocations in a volume. The diffraction patterns were then measured at four different \ndetector positions relative to the inspection volume. The intensities within each pattern \nwere radially integrated to produce the 1D scattering patterns illustrated in figure 6. It \nshould be noted that evaluating thin samples with large crystallites can result in \nincomplete debye rings. Radially integrating the pattern from a 2D detector mitigates \nagainst this effect.   \n \nSimilarly to that demonstrated in section 3.1.1 the Bragg maxima recorded at each \ndetector position were evaluated to identify those with behaviour consistent with equation \n2. The results are illustrated in figures 7 and 8. These patterns correspond well to those \nproduced by aluminium and aluminium oxide. Some of the standard peaks from \naluminium and aluminium oxide are missing in the tracked patterns; this effect is caused \nby the peak overlapping phenomenon mentioned previously. An additional compounding \nconsideration is that any preferred orientation affects may cause peak amplitudes to \ndiminish below the noise level of the detector. \n \n4. Discussion and Conclusion \n \nA novel and versatile rationale capable of identifying the angles of scattered radiation \n(2\u03b8) as well as the positions of diffracting materials (sample position) has been proposed \nand validated in the laboratory. The technique would lend itself well to the \ncharacterisation of materials within a volume such as those required in an airport \nscreening environment because a prior knowledge of the sample position is not required. \nMultiple unknown materials that are spatially separated along the primary X-ray beam \npath can also be resolved simultaneously. Therefore, it could be used to increase the \nefficiency of mail screening systems as multiple letters (located at differing depth planes) \ncould be evaluated at once. Perhaps one of the more interesting aspects of this technique \nis that the spatial differentiation is achieved without the use of post-sample collimation. \nSuch collimation can result in a loss of as much as 99% of the scattered beam flux \nPage 7 of 17\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n(Malden and Speller, 2000) and such systems are thus inherently inefficient. Another \nrelated consideration is the approach in deriving the sample position. For systems that use \npost-sample collimation, the sample position is at the point of intersection defined by the \nprimary and diffracted beam collimators. As such the precision to which the sample \nposition can be identified is constrained by the engineering and mechanical tolerances of \nthe collimators. Our approach has no such limitation. \n \nOne of the main confounding factors of this technique is that of samples elongated along \nthe primary beam. If the sample(s) are elongated along the primary beam axis then in \ntransmission diffraction maxima broadening is observed. This impedes the performance \nof the peak tracking method. The extent to which the performance is affected is \nillustrated by the ROC surface figure 5A. As the samples are elongated the ROC flattens \nnearing the no-discrimination line. To combat the loss in resolution introduced by \nelongated samples section 3.1.3 evaluates the idea of increasing the sample to detector \ndistances. The rate at which the Debye cone propagates with respect to P is greater than \nthe diffraction maxima broadening introduced by the diverging pencil beam. For this \nreason increasing the sample to detector distances acts as a positive optical lever. The \nresult of increasing the sample to detector distance is seen best in figure 5B. ROC curves \nare compared typically using their respective areas. As we are evaluating a third variable \n(elongation) it is appropriate to compare the respective volumes bounded by the ROC \nsurfaces, where a volume of 100% would provide perfect discrimination and 50% would \nprovide no discrimination. Figure 5A has a volume of 84% whereas figure 5B has a \nvolume of 89%. We therefore infer that increasing the sample to detector distances \nshould help alleviate some of the issues encountered by elongated samples. Further, such \nincreases in physical dimensions may well be a natural requirement for some applications \nof our technique. This preliminary work is part of an ongoing programme to incorporate \nX-ray diffraction based materials discrimination into an imaging technique. As a next \nstep we intend to combine this approach with the novel tomographic approach afforded \nby kinetic depth effect X-ray imaging [12].  \n \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis ongoing programme of work is funded by EPSRC and is in collaboration with the \nUK Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB) and the US Department of \nHomeland Security (DHS). \n \nReferences \n \n[1] J.
