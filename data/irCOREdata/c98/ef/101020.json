INTRODUCTION\nThe available methods for modeling transitional to axially\nsymmetric deformed nuclei have undergone a renaissance in\nrecent years. Traditionally, these nuclei have been described\nby models incorporating multiparameter Hamiltonians, such as\nthe interacting boson approximation (IBA) [1] or the geometric\ncollective model (GCM) [2\u20134]. Now, new models based on\na geometrical perspective are emerging that provide single-\nparameter predictions for structure spanning transitional to\naxially symmetric deformed. The underlying idea behind each\nof these models is to make use of a simple potential in the Bohr\nHamiltonian, yielding analytic solutions for both energies and\nelectromagnetic transition strengths.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, analytic solutions to the\nBohr Hamiltonian are interesting in themselves. Still, it can\nalso be explored to what extent these simple potentials provide\nrealistic descriptions of actual nuclei. In the present work, an\nexperimental study of 168Hf is presented to test the predictions\nof some of these new geometrical models. Most models more\nor less converge to similar values (as they approach the\nrigid-rotor limit) in their predictions for very well deformed\nnuclei. However, predictions for several properties of the\nexcited K = 0+ excitations are dramatically different for\nless deformed structures. Since 168Hf, with a ground state\nR4\/2 \u2261 E(4+1 )\/E(2+1 ) of 3.11, is situated in a region outside of\nwell-deformed structures, it should provide a good test case for\ndetermining the applicability of different geometrical models.\nThe models appropriate for describing 168Hf include the\nconfined beta soft (CBS) model [5], the Davidson potential [6,\n7], and the exactly separable version of the Davidson potential\n[8]. The starting point for all of these models is the original\nBohr Hamiltonian [9]\nH = \u2212 h\u00af\n2\n2B\n[\n1\n\u03b24\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u03b24\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b2\n+ 1\n\u03b22 sin 3\u03b3\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b3\nsin 3\u03b3\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b3\n\u2212 1\n4\u03b22\n\u2211\nk=1,2,3\nQ2k\nsin2\n(\n\u03b3 \u2212 23\u03c0k\n)\n]\n+ V (\u03b2, \u03b3 ), (1)\nwhere \u03b2 and \u03b3 are the usual collective coordinates, Qk\n(k = 1, 2, 3) are the components of angular momentum in\nthe intrinsic frame, and B is the mass parameter. Each of\nthese models incorporates a harmonic oscillator potential in\nthe \u03b3 degree of freedom (with a minimum at \u03b3 = 0\u25e6) and\nis characterized by a specific potential in the \u03b2 degree of\nfreedom. The CBS model [5] incorporates an infinite square\nwell potential in the \u03b2 deformation, where the position of\nthe inner wall can be varied. The localization of the potential\nis given by a single parameter, r\u03b2 = \u03b2m\/\u03b2M , where \u03b2m(\u03b2M )\ngives the position of the inner (outer) wall of the infinite well.\nA schematic potential for the CBS model is illustrated in\nFig. 1(a). The parameter r\u03b2 can be varied between 0 and 1,\nwhich describes structure between the limits of X(5) [10]\nand the rigid rotor, respectively. Thus, the CBS model can\nbe applied to describe nuclei with R4\/2 values ranging from\n2.90(r\u03b2 = 0) through 3.33 (r\u03b2 = 1).\nThe Davidson potential [6] is of the form\nV (\u03b2) = \u03b22 + \u03b2\n4\no\n\u03b22\n, (2)\nwhere the single free parameter (aside from scale) is \u03b2o, which\ngives the position of the minimum of the potential in \u03b2.\nExamples of the Davidson potential for a few values of the\nparameter \u03b2o are given in Fig. 1(b). The parameter \u03b2o can,\nin theory, range from 0 to infinity. For \u03b2o = 0, the Davidson\npotential predicts R4\/2 = 2.65. Significantly large values of\n\u03b2o are not required to reach the rigid-rotor limit: For example,\nwith \u03b2o = 4.0, the Davidson potential predicts R4\/2 = 3.32.\nIn the original formulation of the CBS model and the\nDavidson potential, the separation of the \u03b2 and \u03b3 variables is\napproximate. An exact separation of variables can be achieved\nby considering related potentials of the form\nu(\u03b2, \u03b3 ) = u(\u03b2) + u(\u03b3 )\n\u03b22\n. (3)\nTaking the potential in the \u03b3 degree of freedom to be of\nharmonic oscillator form, u(\u03b3 ) = (3c2)\u03b3 2\/2, and u(\u03b2) as\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(6)\/064307(12) 064307-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nE.

Potentials in the \u03b2 degree of freedom used in (a) the CBS\nmodel and (b) the Davidson potential. In both cases, the potential is\ngiven in arbitrary units. The r\u03b2 values given in the plot for the CBS\nmodel are specific values for which the CBS predictions are discussed\nin the text.\nthe Davidson potential gives the so-called exactly separable\nDavidson (ES-D) model [7]. This model incorporates two free\nparameters, \u03b2o and c, where c is a measure of the stiffness of\nthe potential in the \u03b3 degree of freedom.\nThe predictions of the CBS model and the Davidson\npotential include the ground-state band and excited K = 0+\nexcitations. The exactly separable version of the Davidson\npotential also includes predictions for K = 2+ excitations.\nAlthough such states are rather well studied in well-deformed\nnuclei (R4\/2 > 3.2), less information is known in the more\ntransitional region, R4\/2 = 2.9\u20133.2.\nTo appropriately test the validity of these models, additional\ndata are required on transitional nuclei. The present work\nmakes use of high-statistics, \u03b3 -ray coincidence data, leading\nto a substantial revision of the previous 168Hf level scheme and\nimproved measurements of intensities of low-lying transitions.\nIn addition, the present work includes measurements of \u03b3 -\u03b3\nangular correlations to obtain E2\/M1 mixing ratios for\ntransitions between low-lying states and to make definite spin\nassignments.\nII. \u03b2-DECAY SPECTROSCOPY EXPERIMENT\nLow-spin states in 168Hf were populated in the \u03b2+\/\u0002 decay\nof 168Ta and studied through off-beam \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy.\nThe parent 168Ta nuclei were produced through the 159Tb(16O,\n7n) reaction by bombarding a \u223c4.4-mg\/cm2 target with a\n\u223c2-pnA, 130-MeV 16O beam provided by the Yale ESTU\nFIG. 2.

[14] used the\n133Cs(40Ar, 5n) reaction and a combination of He-jet and tape\ncollector setups to study the decay of 168Ta. The evaluated\n168Ta \u03b2-decay data of Ref. [12] is based primarily on the latter\nstudy [14]. The experimental results for levels of interest in\nthe structural interpretation of 168Hf are summarized in the\nfollowing. Cases where the present measurement was able to\nresolve discrepancies between the results of the previous two\n\u03b2-decay studies are also described in detail.\nThe level at 876 keV was previously reported [12] to\ndecay to the 2+1 level and 0\n+\n1 level through transitions of\n752 and 876 keV, respectively, and tentatively assigned a J\u03c0\nof 2+. These two branches were observed and confirmed to\nhave intensities consistent with those given in the literature.\nThe angular correlation analysis of the 752-keV transition\nconfirms the previous spin assignment of 2+, as shown\nin Fig. 5. From the measured mixing ratio, the 752-keV,\n2+2 \u2192 2+1 transition was found to be predominantly E2 in\ncharacter.\nThe level at 942 keV was previously reported [12] to decay\nto only the 2+1 level by a transition of 818 keV and tentatively\nassigned a J\u03c0 of 0+. Analysis of the angular correlation data\nfor the 818-keV transition confirms the 0+ spin assignment, as\nshown in Fig. 4.\nThe level at 1031 keV was previously reported [12] to\ndecay only to the 2+1 level by a transition of 907 keV and\ntentatively assigned a J\u03c0 of 3+. A transition of 645 keV to\nthe 4+1 state was reported by Ref. [13] with intensity 8.5(14).\nHowever, a 645-keV transition was not observed in a later\nstudy (Ref. [14]), where only an upper limit on the intensity\nof <3.0 is reported. In the present work, a 645.05(10)-keV\ntransition with intensity 2.6(3) is observed to depopulate the\nlevel at 1031 keV. Evidence for the placement of this transition\nis given in Fig. 7. The 645-keV line is strongly coincident\nwith the 262-keV, 4+1 \u2192 2+1 transition, as shown in Fig. 7(a).\nIn addition, a gate on the 521-keV transition populating the\nlevel at 1031 keV, as given in Fig. 7(b), clearly shows both\nthe 907- and 645-keV depopulating transitions. The measured\nintensity of the 645-keV transition is consistent with the limit\nreported in Ref. [14], but it does not account for the large\nintensity reported in Ref. [13]. A significant amount of the\nsingles intensity measured in the present work at this energy\ncomes from a 645.24(3)-keV contaminant transition in 160Dy\n[17] identified by its coincidences with the 86-, 197-, and\n064307-6\n\u03b2 DECAY STUDY OF 168Hf AND A TEST OF . . .

[13] with\na 527.4(1)-keV line with intensity 0.88(11) populating the\n6+1 state. The measured intensities of the 527- and 899-keV\ntransitions are consistent with the upper limits of Ref. [14],\nbut they do not account for the large intensities reported in\nRef. [13]. For the 527-keV transition, a significant amount of\nthe singles intensity measured in the present work at this energy\ncomes from a 526.01(10)-keV contaminant transition in 166Yb\n[18]. For the 899-keV transition, no contaminant transition\nwas observed at exactly this energy; however, a 896.12(5)-keV\ntransition in 168Yb was observed as a very strong line in the\nsingles spectrum, which could have contributed to the strength\nobserved in Ref. [13]. The observed depopulating transitions\nsupport the 4+ assignment for this level.\nIn the present work, fifteen new levels are identified above\n1300 keV (Table II). As an example of the level of support\nsurrounding these new levels, the evidence for a selected new\nlevel is described in detail. The level at 1411.78(8) keV is\nidentified on the basis of newly observed transitions of 381,\n536, and 1288 keV to the 3+1 , 2\n+\n2 , and 2\n+\n1 levels, respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 10(a), a 1288-keV transition is observed in\ncoincidence with the 124 keV, 2+1 \u2192 0+1 transition.

Select angular correlations in 166Yb and 168Yb\nWe also performed \u03b3 -\u03b3 angular correlation measurements\non strong, contaminant-free transitions in 166Yb and 168Yb.\nThese results are included in Table III and Figs. 5 and 6. In\neach of these nuclei, the measured \u03b4 values are consistent with\nprevious measurements of multipolarities from \u03b1K values, but\nthey now allow for a better determination of the extent of\nE2\/M1 mixing.\nIn 166Yb, the \u03b4 value measured in the present work of\n0.6 \u00b1 0.2 for the 832-keV, 4+2 \u2192 4+1 transition is consistent\nwith the reported M1 character from the measured \u03b1K value\n[19]. Two possible values of \u03b4 were found for the 997-keV,\n5+1 \u2192 4+1 transition. Combining this information with the \u03b1K\nmeasurement [19], which favors an E2 transition, suggests\nthat the appropriate \u03b4 value is \u221210\u221213+3 .\nIn 168Yb, limits on the multipole mixing were previously\ndetermined [20,21] from measured \u03b1K values. The present\nmeasured \u03b4 values are consistent with the previous limits. The\n780-, 885-, and 896-keV transitions were determined to be\npredominantly E2 in character, consistent with the M1 limits\ngiven in Ref. [21] of <44%, 39%, and <39%, respectively.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nThe newly developed solutions for the geometric models,\nCBS and Davidson potential, provide simple, single-parameter\ndescriptions of transitional to deformed nuclei. 168Hf, with a\nground-stateR4\/2 of 3.11, lies in a transitional region outside of\na well-deformed structure and therefore should provide a good\ntesting ground for these models. In addition, the predictions of\nthe two parameter models, the exactly separable Davidson and\nthe interacting boson approximation model, are also compared\nto the data for 168Hf.\nBecause these models give predictions for the excited K =\n0+, 2+ sequences, it is first necessary to make assignments of\nthe observed states to these sequences. The first excited 2+\nstate at 876 keV is assigned as the bandhead of the K = 2+\nexcitation. This leaves the 2+ state at 1059 keV as the most\nlikely candidate for the 2+ member of the 0+2 -band sequence.\nThe mostly likely candidate for the 4+ member of the\n\u03b3 band is the level at 1161 keV, leaving the 4+ level at\n1285 keV as possibly the 4+ member of the 0+2 -band sequence.\nThere are several supporting arguments for these assignments.\nFrom an energy standpoint, this assignment results in band\nstructures appropriate for K = 0+ and 2+ excitations. The\nresulting R4\/2 ratio in the excited K = 0+ band is 2.94.\nThe energy staggering in the \u03b3 band is also sensitive to\nthe nuclear shape [22]. A common measure of this is the\nquantity S(4) \u2261 [E(4+\u03b3 ) \u2212 2E(3+\u03b3 ) + E(2+\u03b3 )]\/E(2+1 ). For an\naxial rotor, S(4) = +0.33. For a \u03b3 -soft deformed structure\nFIG. 10.

B(E2) values are normalized to\nthe strongest branch with the strength indicated by the widths of the transition arrows.\nS(4) < 0 whereas for a rigid triaxial rotor, S(4) > 0.33. This\nassignment leads to S(4) = \u22120.20. If the assignment of the 4+\nstates is reversed, this results in an R4\/2 ratio in the excited\nK = 0+ band of 1.9 and a staggering in the quasi-\u03b3 band of\nS(4) = +0.80. The first of these is well outside what would be\nexpected for a well-deformed band structure and the second\nwould be highly anomalous since the rare-earth region is well\nknown to exhibit axially symmetric structures. The assignment\nof 4+ states is also suggested by the E2 branching ratios. In the\nAlaga limit, the 4+ of the K = 0+ sequence is expected to have\na strong transition to the 6+ of the ground-state band. Indeed,\nthe strongest B(E2) from the level at 1284 keV populates the\n6+1 level, whereas this transition is not observed from the level\nat 1161 keV.\nHaving assigned the K = 0+, 2+ excited sequences up\nthrough J\u03c0 = 4+, we can now compare the level scheme of\n168Hf to the different model predictions. To fix the parameters\nof the CBS and the Davidson potential models, the single\nfree parameter in each was varied to reproduce the R4\/2\nratio in 168Hf. The corresponding parameters are r\u03b2 = 0.20\nand \u03b2o = 1.84 for the CBS and Davidson potential models,\nrespectively. The resulting level schemes are compared with\nthe data in Fig. 11. Even though the parameters were fixed\nbased on the R4\/2 ratio alone, the agreement is excellent for the\nlocation of the first excited 0+ state. The CBS and Davidson\npotential models predict R0\/2 = E(0+2 )\/E(2+1 ) ratios of 8.0\nand 7.7, respectively, compared with the experimental value\nin 168Hf of 7.6.\nThe B(E2) transition strengths for the CBS and Davidson\npotential models are calculated by using the transition oper-\nators given in Refs. [5] and [7], respectively. The predicted\nbranching ratios from the excited 0+ sequence are almost\nidentical for both models. The branching ratios from members\nof the 0+2 sequence are also summarized in Fig. 12. Both\nmodels provide a reasonable description for the decay of the 2+\nand 4+ member of the 0+2 sequence. The only large discrepancy\nis in the 4+3 \u2192 4+1 transition in which both models overpredict\nthe data by almost an order of magnitude. Included in\nFig. 12 are the Alaga ratios for axially symmetric well-\ndeformed nuclei. The Alaga ratios differ noticeably from\nboth the data and the predictions of the CBS model and\nDavidson potential model, significantly overpredicting the\ndata. A summary of all theoretical B(E2) transition strengths\npredicted by the CBS and the Davidson potential models\nbetween the low-lying states shown in Fig. 11 is given in\nTable IV. Again, the predicted transition strengths are very\nsimilar for both models.\nThe most obvious difference between the CBS and\nDavidson potential model predictions is in the spacings of the\nexcited 0+2 sequence. The Davidson potential gives the very\nsimple prediction that the inertial properties of the ground\nand 0+2 bands are identical; that is, the R4\/2 ratios are equal,\nregardless of the parameter \u03b2o. This agrees well with the data\non 168Hf, where the R4\/2 ratios in the ground and 0+2 bands are\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100  \n168\nHf\n CBS\n Davidson\n IBA\n Alaga\n4\n+\n3\n  2\n+\n1\n4\n+\n3\n \u2192 6\n+\n1 4\n+\n3\n \u2192 \u2192 4\n+\n12\n+\n3\n \u2192 0\n+\n12\n+\n3\n \u2192 2\n+\n1\n2\n+\n3\n \u2192 4\n+\n1\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \nB\n(E\n2)\n S\ntr\nen\ngt\nh\nFIG. 12.

The CBS model, however, predicts\nthat the 0+2 band is more deformed than the ground-state band.\nFor the r\u03b2 value used in the present fit, the CBS model gives an\nR4\/2 ratio in the 0+2 band of 3.25. In addition to this discrepancy,\nthe overall spacing in the 0+2 sequence given by the CBS\nmodel is much more expanded than what is observed in 168Hf.\nThis points to an interesting feature of the CBS model. The\npredicted R4\/2 in the 0+2 sequence suggests a more deformed\nstructure for this band compared with the ground-state band.\nHowever, the 2+\u20130+ spacing predicted by the CBS model\nsuggests a less deformed structure. In the case of the fit to\n168Hf, the CBS model gives the 2+\u20130+ spacing in the excited\n0+ band as 170 keV, compared with the ground-state 2+\u20130+\nspacing of 124 keV.\nThe flexibility in describing 168Hf can be increased by\nconsidering potentials with additional free parameters. For\nthis purpose, the level scheme of 168Hf is also compared to\nthe predictions of the ES-D model and the IBA. Both of these\nmodels also include predictions for the \u03b3 band. The two free\nparameters for each of these models were chosen with an equal\nemphasis on reproducing the R4\/2 ratio, as well as the energies\nof the 0+2 and 2+\u03b3 levels.\nFor the IBA description, calculations were performed using\nthe Hamiltonian [23]\nH (\u03b6, \u03c7 ) = a\n[\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6 )n\u02c6d \u2212 \u03b64NB\n\u02c6Q\u03c7 \u00b7 \u02c6Q\u03c7\n]\n, (4)\nwhere n\u02c6d = d\u2020 \u00b7 \u02dcd and \u02c6Q\u03c7 = (s\u2020 \u02dcd + d\u2020s) + \u03c7 (d\u2020 \u02dcd)(2). Elec-\ntromagnetic transitions are calculated using the E2 operator,\nT (E2) = eBQ. The two free parameters are \u03b6 and \u03c7 , and\nNB = 12 is the number of valence bosons. A reasonable\ndescription of 168Hf was obtained with the parameters \u03b6 =\n0.70 and \u03c7 = \u22120.60. The scaling factor a used in the present\nfit was 1.13. Calculations were performed by diagonalizing the\nHamiltonian numerically using the computer code PHINT [24].\nThe parameters for the ES-D potential that best reproduce\nthe structure of 168Hf are \u03b2o = 0 and c = 2.4. At first,\nthese might seem contradictory to the parameters chosen for\nthe Davidson potential, where a value of \u03b2o = 1.84 was used.\nThe potential for the exactly separable case can be written as\nV (\u03b2, \u03b3 ) = \u03b22 + \u03b2\n4\no\n\u03b22\n+ (3c)\n2\u03b3 2\n\u03b22\n= \u03b22 + \u03b2\n4\no + (3c)2\u03b3 2\n\u03b22\n(5)\nand thus the predictions for the ES-D model depend on the\nparameter combination of \u03b2o and c. The energy of the \u03b3 band\nis most sensitive to the parameter c, as might be expected\nsince c is a measure of the stiffness of the potential in \u03b3 .\nIncorporating a finite value of c to reproduce the energy of\nthe \u03b3 bandhead then requires a smaller value of \u03b2o since the\npotential is already driven to increased stiffness by a nonzero\nc term.\nThe resulting predictions for both the ES-D model and\nthe IBA along with the level scheme of 168Hf are given in\nFig. 13. The energies of the 0+2 and 2+\u03b3 levels are reasonably\nwell reproduced by both the ES-D model and the IBA, with the\nIBA giving a slightly better fit to the 0+2 energy. The predictions\nfor relative B(E2) strengths are almost identical for the ES-D\nmodel compared with the Davidson potential described earlier.\nOverall, the IBA gives a very good description of the B(E2)\nstrengths from both the K = 0+ and 2+ excited bands. As\nseen in Fig. 13, with the exception of the 2+3 \u2192 2+1 transition,\nthe IBA calculations reproduce almost exactly the transition\nstrengths observed in 168Hf. Table IV includes a more complete\nsummary of theoretical B(E2) transition strengths predicted\nby the IBA and ES-D model.\nThe spacing in the 0+2 sequence is again reproduced more\nclosely by the Davidson potential. The IBA predicts a much\nless deformed structure for the 0+2 band, with R4\/2 = 2.33.\nUnlike the CBS model, the predictions for the structure of the\n0+2 sequence are consistent, with both the R4\/2 value and the\n2+\u20130+ spacing in the excited band suggesting structure that is\nless deformed than the ground-state band. This is supported\nalso by the quadrupole moments given in the IBA calculation,\nwith the 2+ state of the 0+2 sequence predicted to have a\nquadrupole moment \u223c70% that of the ground state 2+.\nAlthough each of these models would seem to have\nsimilar character (e.g., soft potentials in \u03b2 for transitional\nnuclei and axially symmetric shapes) the differences for some\nobservables are striking. It is an interesting challenge to\ntry to understand these differences and their origin. For the\nobservables discussed here, the Davidson potential provides\nthe best description of the low-lying K = 0+, 2+ excitations\nin 168Hf. The disagreements with the structure of the excited\nK = 0+ sequence given by the CBS model can be attributed to\nthe infinite rigidity of the outer wall used in the potential. Thus,\n064307-11\nE.

(Color online) Experimental level scheme and relative B(E2) strengths for 168Hf (left) compared with the predictions for the ES-D\nmodel (middle) and IBA calculations (right). Energies are normalized to the experimental E(2+1 ) value. B(E2) values are normalized to the\nstrongest branch with the strength indicated by the widths of the transition arrows.\nthe softer outer wall of the potential given by the Davidson\npotential seems more realistic for describing transitional nu-\nclei. The reason behind the discrepancy in the IBA predictions\nfor the structure of the excited K = 0+ sequence remains an\nopen question. For E2 transitions, the nature of the transition\noperator itself may play an important role.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nOff-beam, \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy was performed on 168Hf\npopulated in \u03b2+\/\u03b5 decay. New coincidence data provided a\nsignificantly revised level scheme, and \u03b3 -\u03b3 angular correlation\nmeasurements yielded spin and multipolarity information on\nimportant states and transitions. The resulting level scheme\nwas compared with the predictions of new geometrical models\nas well as with predictions of the IBA. Overall, the best\ndescription of both level energies and E2 transition strengths is\nobtained with a Davidson potential in the \u03b2 degree of freedom.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nValuable discussions with D.
