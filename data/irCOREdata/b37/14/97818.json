Lett., 36, L20704, doi:10.1029\/2009GL040104.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced considerable\nwarming in the last 50 years [Vaughan et al., 2003; Turner et\nal., 2005], resulting in widespread retreat of marine glacier\nfronts [Cook et al., 2005] and disintegration of floating ice\nshelves on the east coast [Scambos et al., 2000, 2004].\nChanges in atmospheric circulation [van den Broeke and\nvan Lipzig, 2004], most notably the Southern hemisphere\nAnnular Mode (SAM) [Marshall et al., 2006] and regional\nchanges in sea surface temperatures and sea ice extent\n[Meredith and King, 2005] appear to drive interannual\ntemperature fluctuations at the coastal stations in the Ant-\narctic Peninsula. However, temperature trends on the Ant-\narctic continent are less well defined. Kwok and Comiso\n[2002] report a statistically insignificant cooling trend over\ncontinental Antarctica from 1982 to 1998, inferred from\nAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)\ninstruments, while Schneider et al. [2006], in a synthesis\nusing 200 year ice core records from the continent revealed a\nslight warming of about 0.2 \u0002C per century since \u00021880. A\nnew reconstruction approach by Steig et al. [2009] suggests\nthat the warming trend observed in the Antarctic Peninsula\nsince 1957 extends south to the Antarctic continent and into\nWest Antarctica, where temperatures are reported to be\nincreasing by 0.17\u0002C per decade. Ice core reconstructions\nfrom this region reveal a warming trend of 1.0 \u0002C per century\nduring the period 1900\u20131999, based on a stack of several\nWest Antarctic ice cores [Schneider and Steig, 2008].\nUnderstanding the extent to which the extreme warming at\nstations in the north of the Antarctic Peninsula is a localized\nphenomena or if this is representative of regional changes,\nespecially in its southward extent toward the sensitive west\nAntarctic region, is of vital significance in model validation\nand ultimately prediction of future climate change.\n[3] Instrumental records from this remote region are\nshort, rarely exceeding 50 years in length and generally\nconfined to coastal sites. Ice cores, however, provide a\nwealth of climate information that extends beyond the\ninstrumental period making them a valuable tool for inter-\npreting climate trends, such as those observed in the\nAntarctic Peninsula, on a longer temporal framework. In\nthis paper we present a 150-year high resolution stable\nisotope record, a proxy for past temperatures, from the data\nsparse region of the south-western Antarctic Peninsula. We\nuse the data to investigate the regional extent of the reported\nwarming and its statistical significance.\n[4] The isotopic composition, expressed as d18O, is the\nrelative difference in the ratio of the heavy to light isotopes\nof oxygen, 18O\/16O, between a sample and the standard\nVienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW). The linear\nrelationship between local temperature and stable isotopes\nin precipitation at mid- and high-latitudes [Dansgaard,\n1964] has been used to reconstruct past temperature from\nAntarctic ice cores over decades, centuries and millennia\n[EPICA Community Members, 2004; Jouzel et al., 2007].\n2. Data and Methods\n[5] The new ice core, known as Gomez, was drilled in\n2007 to a depth of 136 metres in a high accumulation site on\nthe south-western Antarctic Peninsula (73.59\u0002S, 70.36\u0002W,\n1400 masl) [Thomas et al., 2008]. Samples of 7 cm length\nwere cut for isotope analysis, equal to approximately 12\nsamples per year at the base of the core, with higher\ntemporal resolution in more recent years. Samples of the\nmelted ice (1.6 mL) were used for the stable isotope analysis\nusing an automated CO2-H2O oxygen isotope equilibration\nsystem and subsequent CO2 d\n18O analysis by dual-inlet\nisotope ratio mass spectrometry on a modified VG SIRA\nseries II analyser. All results are reported with respect to\nVSMOW-SLAP. Analytical precision of \u00b10.07% (2s) is\nestimated using data from 480 replicate analyses of the\ninternal laboratory standard (NTW) that were run at random\namongst batches of the Gomez ice samples.\n[6] The annual average d18O was calculated using the\nseasonal cycle in d18O and verified using the winter minima\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 36, L20704, doi:10.1029\/2009GL040104, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n2School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia,\nNorwich, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/09\/2009GL040104$05.00\nL20704 1 of 5\nin hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a photochemical species with\na minima that corresponds to the winter solstice, and the\nsummer maxima in non sea salt sulphate (SO4\n2\u0003) [Thomas\net al., 2008]. Ice core and meteorological years all run\nJuly\u2013June. The estimated error in determining the annual\naverages is \u00b11 month (2005\u20131885) and \u00b12\u20133 months\n(1884\u20131856) due to lower temporal resolution. The esti-\nmated error in the annual average d18O is \u00b11.6%, based on\ncomparison with previous ice cores from Palmer Land\n[Peel et al., 1988] during the period of overlap (1915\u2013\n1992, r = 0.88, p < 0.01).\n[7] We are using a temporal gradient of 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 % per\n\u0002C to convert d18O to temperature, based on the calibration\nbetween the d18O with site temperatures from the European\nCentre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)\n(1980\u20132005). Similar values are achieved when using\ninstrumental records over the same time period from the\ntwo closest stations, Rothera (0.53 % per \u0002C) and Faraday\n(0.55% per \u0002C) and is in agreement with temporal gradients\nfrom an isotopically enabled general circulation model\n(GCM), using 100-year CO2 forced trends [Sime et al.,\n2008]. The authors note that the temporal gradient may\nchange through time and that a change in seasonality may\nalter the reported trends.\n[8] The statistical significance of trends in the d18O\nrecord are tested using the empirical mode decomposition\n(EMD) approach [Huang et al., 1998; Huang and Wu,\n2008; Franzke, 2009] to decompose the time series into a\nfinite number of components, the intrinsic mode functions\n(IMF\u2019s), and a residual which we interpret as a trend. The\nEMD approach is used to extract physically meaningful\nmodes and nonlinear trends from nonlinear and non-\nstationary time series that cannot be captured by a linear\nleast-square fit. The IMFs and the trends are tested against\nthree different null models to test the statistical signifi-\ncance; 1) white noise, where we assume that all measure-\nments are uncorrelated; 2) a First-Order Autoregressive\nProcess (AR(1)) [Franzke, 2009] which allows for short-\nrange correlation of the data and 3) a fractionally\ndifferenced process [Percival et al., 2001] which is a\nlong-range correlated process and exhibits trend-like be-\nhaviour over finite periods. For the white noise null model\nwe only estimate the variance of Gomez time series, for\nthe AR (1) we estimate the lag-1 auto-correlation value\nand variance, and for the fractional differenced model we\nestimate the long-range dependency parameter d by the\nDetrended Fluctuation Analysis [Koscielny-Bunde et al.,\n1998].\n3. Results and Discussion\n[9] The annual average d18O, together with a running\ndecadal mean, is plotted in Figure 1. There is a shift to less\nnegative d18O values since the 1850s from a decadal\naverage value of \u000323.5 % during 1857\u20131866 to \u000322.0\n% in the most recent decade. Over the whole period this\ntrend represents a warming of \u00020.14 \u00b1 0.06 \u0002C decade\u00031.\nEMD analysis reveals that most of the variance (\u000275%) is\nat the intra-decadal time scale but there is significant\nvariance at inter-decadal time scales.\n[10] The d18O exhibits a nonlinear trend (Figure 1),\ncooling slightly in the period 1857 through 1900, followed\nby a pronounced warming after 1900, that is statistically\nsignificant at the 2.5% level against all three null models.\nThis is in agreement with trends observed in borehole\ntemperature profiles from the Antarctic Peninsula [Nicholls\nand Paren, 1993] and the Rutford ice stream, west Antarc-\ntica [Barrett et al., 2009]. Similar behaviour has been found\nin EMD analysis of the SAM [Franzke, 2009], the principal\nmode of variability in the southern hemisphere, suggesting\nthat the SAM has a strong influence on the Gomez temper-\nature record. Precipitation (and hence d18O contained there-\nin) at the Gomez site is dominated by synoptic-scale storm\nactivity from the Bellingshausen Sea [Turner et al., 1997;\nThomas and Bracegirdle, 2009] and thus the intensified\nwesterly winds associated with the positive phase of the\nSAM in recent decades, will enhance transport of warm\nmaritime air to the site due to the blocking effect of the\nmountainous Antarctic Peninsula. This mechanism was\ndemonstrated in the Gomez accumulation record as a\ndramatic increase in snowfall since the 1960s that is\nstrongly correlated to the SAM [Thomas et al., 2008].\nIndeed, comparison of d18O with the SAM index [Marshall,\n2003] reveals that approximately a third of the variability in\nannual mean surface temperatures at the site (1957\u20132005)\nmay be attributed to changes in the SAM.\n[11] The largest warming has occurred since the 1950s,\ncoincident with the start of the instrumental records. During\nthis period the annual average surface temperature at the\nGomez site, estimated using the isotope composition, has\nincreased at a rate of 0.055 \u00b1 0.02 \u0002C year\u00031, with four of\nthe warmest years in the 150-year record occurring in the\nlast decade.\n[12] A study using satellite-derived temperatures to in-\nvestigate interannual variations hypothesized that the\nGomez region, with its relatively low elevation and location\nwest of the topographic divide, would be influenced by the\nsame air masses that govern climate over the west coast of\nthe Peninsula [King and Comiso, 2003]. This coherent\nregion of high interannual temperature variability extends\nsouth into southern Palmer Land (south of the Gomez site)\nand north through the South Shetland Islands. The regional\nlink was demonstrated in previous ice cores studies from the\nPalmer Land plateau [Peel et al., 1988] and for this site\nusing trajectory paths from ECMWF reanalysis data (1980\u2013\n2001) [Thomas and Bracegirdle, 2009].\nFigure 1. Gomez annual average d18O (blue), running\ndecadal mean (red) and nonlinear trend (black). The running\ndecadal mean is derived using an 11-point Gaussian\nwindow filter.\nL20704 THOMAS ET AL.: SIGNIFICANT ANTARCTIC PENINSULA WARMING L20704\n2 of 5\n[13] Despite the complex relationship between local\norography and synoptic scale activity and in contrast to\nprevious ice core records from the north and east Antarctic\nPeninsula [Peel et al., 1988; Thompson et al., 1994;\nVaughan et al., 2003], the Gomez d18O record appears to\ncapture both local and regional temperature variability. The\nannual average isotopic composition is not only strongly\ncorrelated with satellite-derived annual mean site temper-\natures [King and Comiso, 2003] (r = 0.77, p < 0.01\n(1989\u20131999)), confirming d18O is representative of local\ntemperature, but also the annual average temperatures at\nFaraday\/Vernadsky station (Figure 2) almost 600 km north\nof the ice core site. Regardless of the precipitation bias in\nthe ice core such that the annual isotope record is a\ncomposite of only days when there was precipitation at\nGomez, the d18O record captures annual (r = 0.44, p <\n0.01) and decadal (r = 0.70, n = 5) variability at the north\nwest coast station and exhibits comparable warming\ntrends; 0.055 \u00b1 0.02 \u0002C yr\u0003 and 0.054\u0002C yr\u00031 respectively\n(1955\u20132005).\n[14] The relatively short time period available from the\nGomez ice core means that statistical approaches cannot\nunequivocally show if the warming is due to intrinsic\nclimate variability or external forcing by anthropogenic\n(e.g., greenhouse gas emissions) and\/or other factors. A\nprevious ice core from the Dyer Plateau, \u0002300 km north\neast of the Gomez site, concluded that the most recent two\ndecades of the record (1968\u20131988) were the warmest of the\nlast five centuries [Thompson et al., 1994], suggesting that\nthe observed warming at Gomez is outside of the range of\nnatural variability. However, the Dyer Plateau record is\npoorly correlated with the instrumental records and does\nnot capture the magnitude of the warming observed during\nthe same period at Faraday\/Vernadsky [Thompson et al.,\n1994; Vaughan et al., 2003]. Therefore, in the absence of\nadditional longer records, we complement our comparison\nwith simple stochastic models by comparing the trend\nobserved in the Gomez ice core with data from phase three\nof the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3),\navailable as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange (IPCC) Assessment Report Four (AR4). Unforced\npre-industrial control data for 20 different coupled climate\nmodels (summarised in Table 1) were downloaded, com-\nprising an all-model total of 8338 years.\n[15] Both the 50 and the 100 years trends observed in the\nGomez ice core are larger than the 99th percentile of the\nfrequency distribution of respective trends simulated in\nindividual runs of the CMIP3 pre-industrial control runs.\nFigure 3 shows the frequency distribution of 50-year trends\nof surface temperature at Gomez, interpolated to the Gomez\nlocation from the gridded climate model data. The 95th\npercentile of the distribution is 0.022 \u0002C yr\u00031, which is below\nthe 1955\u20132005 trend of 0.055 \u00b1 0.02 \u0002C yr\u00031 derived from\nthe Gomez ice core. A similar analysis of 100 year trends (not\nshown) also shows the 95th percentile of trends derived from\nthe CMIP3 pre-industrial control runs (0.009 \u0002C yr\u00031) to be\nless than observed (0.024 \u00b1 0.01 \u0002C yr\u00031 between 1905 and\n2005). Assuming that the models accurately capture the full\nrange of natural variability, which is difficult to verify in\nAntarctica, then this suggests that the observed warming is\nvery unlikely to have occurred in the absence of external\nnatural and\/or anthropogenic climate forcing. An important\ncaveat is that the CMIP3 climate models may under-estimate\nthe range of unforced variability, which would reduce the\nFigure 2. Comparing Gomez d18O and Faraday temperatures.

Therefore more research is\nrequired to reach a firm conclusion.\n4. Conclusions\n[16] The Gomez d18O record reveals that the rate of\nsurface temperature increase in the south western Antarctic\nPeninsula is similar to that observed at Faraday\/Vernadsky\nstation on the north west coast, warming by as much as\n\u00022.7\u0002C since the 1950s. The strong correlation between\nFaraday surface temperatures and Gomez d18O (1947\u2013\n2006) confirm that the Gomez record may be considered\na proxy for local and regional temperatures on the western\nAntarctic Peninsula. Therefore the statistically significant\n100-year warming trend observed at Gomez, starting around\n1900, and the exceptional warming since the 1950s (both of\nwhich are outside of the expected range of natural variabil-\nity estimated from CMIP3 climate models), represent re-\ngional changes that extend at least as far south as the Gomez\nsite (74\u0002S).\n[17] Acknowledgments.
