Within the supply chain the need \nfor much closer, long-term relationships is increasing due to supplier rationalisation and \nglobalisation (Spekman et al, 1998) and more information about these interactions is \nrequired.    The research specifically tested the well-accepted Williamson\u2019s (1975) Economic \nOrganisations Failure Framework as a theoretical model through which long term \ncollaborative relationships can be viewed. \n \nMethodology\/Approach \nAn exploratory research project was designed and carried out on a self-selected census of 54 \nmonopolistic relationships representing \u00a3575.8m annual spend on equipment and associated \nservices within the UK Defence Procurement organisation (a 10% sample).  Its aims were to \nunderstand the relationship dynamics within long-term, sustained monopolies and to \ndetermine if generic success factors could be found to assist managers to break out of the \nessentially negative situation.  A triangulated data capture approach was employed using both \nquantitative and qualitative methods from both the Industry and MoD sides of each \nrelationship and the research instruments concentrated on the 5 dimensions of the theoretical \nmodel with questions grounded in the literature. \n  \nFindings \nThe study demonstrated that the theoretical model could provide powerful insights into the \nresearch subject and especially revealed the important part played by co-operation, co-\nordination and collaboration (C3 Behaviour) in reducing the inherently negative effects of \nclose proximity and limited choice relationships. \n \nLimitations \nIt is acknowledged that a somewhat unusual approach to examining collaborative, long-term \nsupply chain relationships and have integrated the variables in Williamson\u2019s (1975) \nOrganisations Failure Framework in an innovative way.  Using a combination of quantitative \nand qualitative data is inevitably a compromise between the extremes of imposing rationality \non the data collection and interpretation and, allowing the data to emerge and speak for itself.  \nThe research has used a narrow view through a specific theoretical model lens to achieve a \nbroad understanding of business relationships within a single, albeit large, organisation. \n \nTheoretical Implications \nDespite the adverse small numbers\/restricted market influences encountered, strong \ncounterbalancing, positive business drivers were likely to produce examples of relationship-\nbuilding, specific investments, co-operative behaviour, open communications and a desire to \nreduce the burden of governance through more equitable, long-term arrangements. \n \nPractical Implications \nManagers can reduce sources of frustration that generate negative behaviours by taking joint \nactions.   Central to achieving this is C3 Behaviour where setting synchronised objectives, \npursuing joint approaches to service and product delivery, lowering costs and risks and \n   4\npromoting measures to support the growth of trust appear to be the best ways of halting \nnegative behaviour spirals. \n \nOriginality\/Value of the paper \nThe prime contribution of this exploratory research is the exposure of relationship dynamics \nwithin a large sample of long-term, collaborative supply chain business dyads using an \nintegrated application of Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure Framework.   We \nconclude that the methodology provides a powerful tool to allow objective data to be \ncollected and rich perspectives to be taken from its exploration.  \n \nKeywords:  Supply Chain Management, Integration, Collaboration, C3 Behaviour, \nWilliamson\u2019s Organisations Failure Framework, UK Defence Procurement \n \nPaper type: Research View Point.\n   5\nUnderstanding collaborative supply chain relationships through the \napplication of the Williamson Organisational Failure Framework. \n \n \nAbstract \n \nMany researchers have studied supply chain relationships however, the preponderance of \nopen markets situations and \u2018industry-style\u2019 surveys have reduced the empirical focus on the \ndynamics of long-term, collaborative, interdependent, dyadic relationships.  Within the \nsupply chain the need for much closer, long-term relationships is increasing due to supplier \nrationalisation and globalisation (Spekman et al, 1998) and more information about these \ninteractions is required.  This paper describes the results from a substantial, exploratory \nresearch project undertaken within the UK Defence sector.  This sector was chosen in order \nto reduce the distraction caused by competitive influences on the relationships in view.  The \nresearch specifically tested the well-accepted Williamson\u2019s (1975) Economic Organisations \nFailure Framework as a theoretical model through which long term collaborative \nrelationships can be viewed.    The study demonstrated that the theoretical model could \nprovide powerful insights into the research subject and especially revealed the important part \nplayed by co-operation, co-ordination and collaboration (C3 Behaviour) in reducing the \ninherently negative effects of close proximity and limited choice relationships.  The \nimplications for theory and practise are discussed.    \n  \nKeywords:  Supply Chain Management, Collaboration, C3 Behaviour, Williamson\u2019s \nOrganisations Failure Framework, UK Defence Procurement \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe Supply Chain literature, which includes supply chain management (SCM), logistics, \ntransportation, strategic alliances, industrial marketing, purchasing, economics and \norganisational behaviour (Kern & Willcocks, 2002, Zheng et al, 2000), describes a wide \nvariety of transactional to relational business relationships both in the public and private \nsectors.  However, although suppliers have recognised the need for increased integration with \ntheir customers, the field contains limited empirical research on modelling and studying both \nend-to-end supply chain relationships and long-term dyadic interactions between major \npartners (Christopher, 2005, Cooper et al, 1997, Bectel & Jayaram, 1997).  Moreover, \nalthough it is acknowledged that there are advantages in reducing the number of suppliers \nwithin highly collaborative situations and, the literature describes a wealth of operational and \nbehavioural success factors, the disadvantages of reduced flexibility and competition options \n(Fawcett & Magnan, 2002), are only covered in restricted depth.  Lastly, it is widely accepted \nthat co-operative supply chain relationships achieve benefits for the participants (Christopher, \n2005, Stevens, 1989) however, it is also apparent that full SCM implementation is not being \nachieved (Kemppainen & Vepsalainen, 2003).  This is because partners are still taking a \nshort-term view, often in the face of increasing market-place complexity and uncertainty and \nare limiting the extent to which they extend their collaborative focus (Fawcett & Magnan, \n2002).  This can often generate adversarial practices such as power abuse, lack of \ntransparency, poor communications and reluctance to adopt attitudinal change (Anscombe & \nKearney, 1994, Hines & Jones, 1996).  Research into these failure situations is comparatively \nrare.  We conclude that the concepts of SCM appear to be well known by academia and \nbusiness but research is limited in the key area of long-term collaboration where close \nproximity of the partners may generate both positive and negative behaviours.  The object of \n   6\nour research project is to use Oliver Williamson\u2019s (1975) Economic Organisations Failure \nFramework, which describes market relationship breakdown dynamics, as a theoretical model \nto see if it is able to provide us with insights into intense supply chain relationships between \ncollaborating partners. \n \nThis paper first outlines the development of relational approaches within supply chain \nmanagement thinking and practice.  It starts broadly but focuses on tightly coupled \nrelationships, exploring briefly the boundaries of restrictive\/monopolistic practices.  We \nbriefly describe our search for an appropriate theoretical framework and the rationale for \nselecting a Transaction Cost Economics approach.  We then describe our case study within \nUK Defence supply chains which was chosen because its small numbers\/limited market \nsituation minimises competitive relationship pressures.  Finally, we discuss the implications \nfor theory and practise.  \n \nSupply Chain Management Relationships \n \nSCM can be seen as an integrative, proactive approach (Matthyssens & Van den Bulte, 1994) \nto manage the total flow of a distribution channel to the ultimate customer \u2013 like \u2018a well-\nbalanced and well-practiced relay team\u2019 (Cooper & Ellram, 1993).  Another definition that \nhighlights its \u2018board level\u2019 importance is the strategic management of the network of \norganisations that are involved in the up-stream production and down-stream distribution \nprocesses and activities associated with the satisfaction of customers and maximisation of \nboth current and long term profitability is (Christopher, 1992, 2005, Cox & Lamming, 1997, \nHarland, 1996a, Kemppainen & Vepsalainen, 2003).  It is located between vertically \nintegrated systems and those where the channel members operate completely independently \nand it aims to reduce inventory, to increase customer service reliability and build a \ncompetitive advantage for the channel (Boddy et al, 2000, Cavinato, 1992, Fawcett & \nMagnan, 2002, Hines & Jones, 1996).  \n \nA key feature of SCM is an early decision to reduce the number of suppliers in the chain (the \nelimination of multiple sourcing) (Ellram, 1991) because maintaining close, intense \nrelationships can be very expensive in management effort (Cavinato, 1992, Langley & \nHolcomb, 1992).  The intention is to have no more \u2018partners\u2019 than necessary and to work \nmore closely, effectively, and over the longer term, (Peck et al, 2000, Scott & Westbrook, \n1991) with those who have the most critical impact on the overall operation (Cooper et al, \n1997).  Japanese lean automotive producers have typically 300 suppliers compared to 1000-\n2500 in the west and operate a determined policy of supplier base reduction \u2013 moving from \naway from multi-sourced, adversarial trading - towards closer relationships with fewer, key \npartners (Harland, 1996a, Hines & Jones 1996).  It is hoped that deeper, inter organisational \nalliances\/partnerships can evolve and focus on the whole Supply Chain rather than diluting \neach company\u2019s efforts through conflicting goals (Anscombe & Kearney, 1994). In fact \nBechtel & Jayaram (1997) and Perks & Easton (2000) extend this concept further to suggest \nthat SCM provides a business  environment in which firms closely co-operate rather than \ncompete to achieve mutual goals and are incentivised to join in collaborative innovation \n(Harland, 1996a).  With fewer, strategic partners it is possible to share confidential demand \ninformation and to reduce uncertainty and therefore safety stocks, which lower costs and \norder cycle time (Cooper & Ellram, 1993, Lamming, 1993, Bechtel & Jayaranth, 1997).  To \nthis end the use of e-commerce is a prime example of what Tompkins (2000) calls quality \ncommunications.    \n \n   7\nThe integrated Supply Chain view uses a number of terms that indicate the need for closer \nrelationships, including trust, commitment, co-operation, co-ordination and collaboration \nbetween Supply Chain members to ensure the success of these arrangements (Christopher, \n2005, Hines & Jones, 1996, 1999, Spekman et al, 1998).  Both Stevens (1989) and Hulme \n(1997) point out that integration of this nature is more than a change of scope; it is more \nsignificantly a change in attitude away from the adversarial attitude of conflict to one of \nmutual support and co-operation.    Ellram (1991) proposes that SCM avoids some of the \nmain drawbacks of vertical integration including limiting competition, increasing risk and \ndiseconomies of scale.  Empirical evidence suggests that close long-term relationships \nbetween customers and suppliers have a beneficial impact on performance (Giannakis & \nCroom, 2004). Customer and supplier commit to continuous improvement and shared \nbenefits by exchanging information openly and resolve problems by working together (Sako \net al, 1994). Lamming et al. (2001) propose that, by harnessing the unique capabilities of \npartnership, it is possible to create a shield from system-level forces. Partnership is a complex \nconcept whose success depends upon duration to build trust (Sako et al., 1994).  When \nmistrust is entrenched, a shift from adversarial to co-operative relationship styles is extremely \ndifficult.  Moreover, Macbeth & Fergusson (1994) and Kern & Willcocks (2002) propose \nthat despite the availability of modern information systems, the practice of managing Supply \nChain players is wasteful of resources and drags performance backwards rather than \npromoting continuous improvement.  Furthermore, Cooper et al (1997) believe that achieving \ntrue Supply Chain integration is \u2018a lofty and difficult goal\u2019 and research indicates that \ncompanies continue to struggle to operationalise SCM principles such that they support \ndynamically changing business influences (Braithwaite, 1998,).  We conclude that since SCM \nappears to implicitly require a move towards a limitation of the number of market players \ninvolved \u2013 small numbers, effective supply chain relationship management presents a more \ncomplex set of challenges to achieve success.  \n \n \nThe Challenge of Collaboration \n \nAcademics have used a number of approaches within SCM research to capture perspectives \ncontaining the key facets of inter-organisational, operational and inter-personal dynamics.  \nGiannakis & Croom, (2004) propose an SCM paradigm conceptual framework, the \u20183S \nModel\u2019 containing the synthesis of business resources and networks, the synergy between \nnetwork actors and, the synchronization of operational decisions.  The International \nMarketing and Purchasing Group\u2019s dyadic interaction approach summarised by Kern & \nWillcocks (2002), supply chain integration reviewed by  Fawcett & Magnan (2002)  and, \nnetworks of relationships described by Harland et al (2001) and  Kemppainen & Vepsalainen \n(2003) all suggest that exposing the relationship management aspects of supply chain \nrelationships and their impact on performance(Giannakis & Croom, 2004) is highly \nproblematical.  The literature also contains examples of research describing relationship \nbehaviours between one\/many buyers, one\/many sellers and dominant market \u2018players\u2019 in \nboth public and private sector situations.  Within the Marketing literature Michael Porter\u2019s \n(1980) five forces model of competitive advantage considers short-term, arms-length \ncompetition and the exercise of market power by limiting competition through the creation of \nbarriers to entry (Rugman & D\u2019Cruz, 2000).  Andrew Cox et al (2000) alternatively see the \ncombination of resource utility and scarcity creating a power regime in which the involved \nparties will employ adversarial\/non-adversarial and arms-length\/collaborative arrangements \ndepending on their relative power positions.  In the 1990s UK motor industry supply chains, \nemploying economic power was a driving objective to achieve the \u2018vantage point\u2019 (Lamming, \n   8\n1993).  Examples of small numbers or monopoly (Fishwick, 1993),  and strong market power \nrelationships between dominant firms are also found within the retail sector where major \nsupermarkets such as Walmart with their own brands, fought \u2018price wars\u2019 with global \ncompanies such as Coca Cola and Pepsi.  Eventually the balance of power was restored to \nprevented intense, adversarial influences from destroying long term relationships \n(Christopher, 2005).  In the public sector Harland et al, (2000) revealed that UK Health \nAuthority procurement relationships contained distinctive features such as dedicated \nsuppliers with reduced availability of alternatives and, where the government made the rules \nand could sanction anti-competitiveness. Parker and Hartley\u2019s (1997) recommended that the \nUK Ministry of Defence (MoD) should accept that its major procurements operated under \nmonopoly or near-monopoly conditions rather than attempting to maintain a competitive \nsemblance.  They concluded that adversarial competition should be abandoned and \ncollaboration based on long-term, trusting relationships should be established.   \n \nThese examples suggest, regardless of power or sector consideration, collaboration is \npreferable to adversarial competition however, managing close proximity relationships seems \nto require new understanding of the dynamics involved (Brooks & Pawar, 2000, Cooper et al, \n1997, Giannakis & Croom, 2004, Harland, 1996b).  For instance, collaborative relationships \nare likely to be far more prone to positive feedback than an arms-length relationship.  In these \ncircumstances minor problems can, if not recognised and managed, become personalised and \nemotional which increases the likelihood that new substantive conflicts will emerge and \naccelerate (Hanbrick, et al, 2001).  Conversely, it is also possible for collaborative enterprise \nto bring operational advantages in the longer term as the partners become more effective as \nthey develop through prior experience and active management of the learning process.  Co-\noperation induces further co-operation over time and the emergence of trust and loyalty \ngenerates increasing benefits (Lambert et al, 1996, Luo & Park, 2004). \n \nIn summary, supply chain research has concentrated mainly on competitive market operations \nand although there are some useful insights from the power confrontations between major \nindustry players in small numbers situations, the research sheds only limited empirical light \nhas been shed on prolonged, small numbers, supply chain relationships and their dynamics.  \nWe thus set out to discover if it was possible to find an appropriate model with which to \nexplore the tightly coupled supply chain relationship dynamics found within a large group of \nUK MoD\/industry dyads. \n \nTesting the Williamson Framework \n \nA lack of research on small numbers business relationships hampered the search for an \nappropriate model through which to view those found in long term collaborative \nrelationships.  Both Porter\u2019s (1980) Five Forces and Cox et al\u2019s (2000) Relation Power \nAnalysis considered competition-limiting strategies but did not address the detailed internal \nmanagement implications.  In a review of the contracting and transaction cost economics \nliteratures, we noted a concentration on the need to economise on the cost of transactions \nincluding negotiating and enforcing contracts and internal control and management overheads \n(Faulkner & De Rond, 2000, Palmer, 2001).  Individuals were viewed as \u2018economic actors\u2019 \nand theories focused on adopting appropriate forms of governance to minimise the risks \nassociated with opportunistic behaviour (Hill, 1980 2000, Macneil, 1980, Madhok, 2000, \nNooteboom, 1999).  Supply chain integration arrangements were acknowledged within \n\u2018hybrids\u2019 or partnerships (Williamson, 1996) and relationship-building included investments \nin specific assets (un-recoverables such as time and resources) which generated mutual \n   9\ndependence and served as hostages against opportunism.  Williamson (1996) believed that a \nfarsighted, \u2018calculative\u2019 approach to commercial contracting was required that relied on cost-\neffective contractual safeguards rather than trust.  TCE is not a dynamic theory (Besanko et \nal, 2000) and it ignores the relational aspects of co-operation such as trust which evolve over \ntime and change the nature of the transactions themselves (Faulkner & De Rond, 2000, \nNooteboom, 1999).  Accordingly, academics have moved away in the last 10 years as part of \na general trend away from transactional business dealings, TCE continues to provide valid \ntheories on why firms make or buy (Pessali & Fernandez, 1999).    Nevertheless, in Oliver \nWilliamson\u2019s (1975) Economic Organisation Failures Framework he described a situation \nwhere the cost of managing the risk associated with human factors such as opportunism, \ninformation impactedness, uncertainty\/complexity and bounded rationality became too high \nand forced the market could break down and a firm to internalise the business, in effect \ncreating an internal monopoly (Faulkner & de Rond, 2000).  From casual observation of UK \nDefence Supply Chain relationships where, despite the need to rely on maintaining close \nrelationships over the supply of highly specialised goods, both sides are open to opportunistic \nbehaviour and trust is minimised, it seems that the Organisations Failure Framework has face \nvalidity as an appropriate model.  On these grounds if we were to use Williamson\u2019s \nframework as the theoretical model for our research project and to devise appropriate \nmeasures, we needed to examine the dimensions in more detail in order to determine the \npositive end of the spectrum of SCM relational dynamics that might fall under each.    \n \n\u2022 Bounded Rationality can be reversed by enabling mutual creativity through \napproaches such as open contracts (Cooper & Ellram, 1993), joint innovation, \napplying stretch targets, ensuring disputes are resolved quickly and fairly and finally \nby taking a long-term view of the relationship (Ganesan, 1994). \n \n\u2022 Uncertainty\/Complexity may be overcome by building relationship stability and \ncreating a framework for successful business (Peck et al, 2000, Zheng et al, 2000).  \nWorking more closely with fewer partners (Ellram, 1991, Lewin & Johnston, 1997, \nBoddy et al, 2000), pursuing mutual objectives through value creation (Lamming et \nal, 2001), joint investment and harmonised processes (Cooper et al, 1997, Harland, \n1996a, Madhok, 2000), actively managing the relationship interface through key \naccount management and innovative procurement processes (Cox & Lamming, 1997) \nand, through C3 Behaviour, building interdependence (Moss Kanter, 1994, Spekman \net al, 1998). \n \n\u2022 Information Impactedness can be defeated by creating a communication environment \noptimised for success (Sheth & Sharma, 1997).  This involves implementing multiple \ncommunication links at all level between firms (Mohr & Spekman, 1994, Morgan & \nHunt, 1994) including KAM, IS (Harrison, 1990), sharing business and design data, \nobjective performance measurement (Matthyssens, 1994), transparency in jointly \nmanaging risk (Cox & Lamming, 1997) and, responding quickly to the needs of your \npartner (McDonald et al, 1997). \n \n\u2022 Opportunism is a dangerous effect that is quite difficult to reverse and requires \nmeasures to strengthen the relationship by creating a reliable business infrastructure.  \nA focus on the quality of the relationship outputs (Christopher, 2005, Harrison, 1990) \nincluding operational efficiency (Harland, 1996a, Lamming, 1993), is key as is clarity \nover the boundaries of the relationship (Noordewier et al, 1990).  A creative approach \nto conflict and problem solving (Hulme, 1997) helps to sustain impetus and finally the \n   10\nbuilding of goodwill, trust and commitment (Faulkner & De Rond, 2000) by \nincrementally building on achievements through credible commitments creates a \nvirtuous circle (Goleman, 1998, Doz & Oguz, 2000). \n \n\u2022 Small Numbers constraints can be overturned by incentivising a quality relationship \nwhere the gains are both shared and highly rewarding (Watson, 1999).  Both sides feel \nempowered to strive dynamically for the mutual good (Cooper & Gardner, 1993) and \nabove all true equity in the relationship overcomes any power imbalance (Lamming et \nal, 2001). \n \n \nUtilising the concept of a self-reinforcing, positive feedback effect within collaborative \nrelationships (Hanbrick, et al, 2001, Lambert et al, 1996, Luo & Park, 2004), we adapted \nWilliamson\u2019s (1975) framework by placing his dimensions into the success and failure cycles \nshown in Figures 1 and 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

Supply Chain Relationship Failure Cycle. \n \nThese cycles represent the opposite ends of the spectrum of relationship dynamics that we \nmight reasonably expect to encounter (Wilding & Humphries, 2002). \n \nIn the next section we describe a case study which tested the theoretical framework on a large \nsample of UK Defence supply chain relationships.  This sector was selected because it \noffered an opportunity to carry out research within long-term, small numbers \n(monopoly\/restricted market) businesses without the distraction of normal competitive \ninfluences. \n \nThe UK Defence Environment and the Williamson framework. \n \nThe procurement of high technology equipment, spare parts and repair services is a \nstrategically important element of UK Government spending worth over \u00a310 billion per year \nand as with other public sector areas, has been subject to a relentless drive to achieve greater \nvalue for money.  An important element of this strategy has been to establish long-term \nsupply chain partnerships with industrial suppliers as a means of overcoming traditional \nadversarial attitudes which have resulted in a succession of high-profile cost, time and project \nperformance overruns.  However, in the face of global spending cutbacks the continued \nconcentration of the Defence Equipment Suppliers has resulted in an increasingly \nmonopolistic situation where very large relationship-specific investments are made and each \nside wields considerable power but, lack of trust and the option to leave the relationship are \nreduced.  This results in lowered efficiency, increase costs and offer little incentive to co-\noperate (Humphries & Wilding, 2001, Palmer, 2001, Parker & Hartley 1997).   \n \nIn the previous section we asserted that Williamson's (1975) Economic Organisation Failures \nFramework demonstrated face validity as a means of representing highly collaborative \nInformation \nImpactedness \nMonopoly \nEnvironment \nBounded \nRationality \ndo the minimum you \ncan get away with \ntake a short term \nview and avoid risk\nBusiness \nMyopia \ndeliberately \nconfuse to gain \nadvantage \nOpportunism \nonly focus on \nyour own \nobjectives \npartners are trapped \nby limited choices \n   12\nrelationship dynamics.  The following paragraph indicates that this can be extended in a \nstylised way to the UK Defence sector. \n \n The lack of stability in the Defence market due to the variability of Government spending \nplans ensures inherent market uncertainty and complexity (Hartley, 1998).  Moreover, \neconomic pressures have forced the UK MoD to reduce costs by attempting to drive down \nindustry\u2019s profit to a \u2018reasonable\u2019 level.  This encourages secretive behaviour from \ncontractors including selective and distorted information disclosures, especially over costs - \ninformation impactedness, which undermines the durability of contract arrangements (Liston-\nHeyes, 1995).  As a result industry loses its incentive to perform better and, the UK MoD \nreduces the resources available to industry that might have been used to fund important \nResearch and Development.  This is bounded rationality where short term policies limit \nperformance to the adequate rather than the optimum (Simon, 1957).  The sum effect is an \nadversarial relationship without the freedom to look to the market for alternatives (Parker & \nHartley, 1997) and the formation of small numbers\/monopoly situation.   \n \nOliver Williamson did not intend his framework to be a causal model; rather it portrayed an \n\u2018atmosphere\u2019 containing human and environmental factors.  Although the authors can find no \nempirical research using Williamson's framework in similar circumstances, it appears to \ndescribe a small numbers \u2018atmosphere\u2019 that is appropriate for use in the intended research \nsituation (Humphries & Wilding, 2003).  We therefore decided to use its 5 non-causal \ndimensions as the theoretical model with which to investigate collaborative supply chain \nrelationship dynamics within the UK Defence sector. \n \nUK Defence Survey Approach   \n \nAn exploratory research project was designed and carried out on a self-selected census of 54 \nmonopolistic relationships representing \u00a3575.8m annual spend on equipment and associated \nservices within the UK Defence Procurement organisation (a 10% sample).  Its aims were to \nunderstand the relationship dynamics within long-term, sustained monopolies and to \ndetermine if generic success factors could be found to assist managers to break out of the \nessentially negative situation represented by Figure 1.  A triangulated data capture approach \nwas employed using both quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (semi-structured \ninterview) methods from both the Industry and MoD sides of each relationship and the \nresearch instruments concentrated on the 5 dimensions of the theoretical model in Figure 2  \nwith questions grounded in the literature.  Given that the research area supply chains were \nlikely to manifest a variety of success levels, the opposite of the negative definitions of \nWilliamson\u2019s (1975) framework were used to label the dimensions and, questions with a \npositive orientation (quality, reliability, creativity, stability, communication) as shown in \nFigure 2.  It was considered that this approach would counterbalance the possibility of \nrespondents following the hypothesised negativity predicted by Williamson\u2019s framework.  \nThese were validated by focus groups of practitioners during the research pilot phase and \nboth the dimensions and questions achieved a satisfactory 0.7977 level of Coefficient Alpha \nin the study (Bowman & Ambrosini, 1997).  629 Likert scale questionnaires of organisation-\nselected, knowledgeable staff were completed and the mean scores representing respondents \nperceptions of satisfaction were aggregated to provide per-dimension overall scores. Previous \nSupply Chain relationships research (Doney & Cannon, 1997, Mohr & Spekman, 1994, \nNoordewier et al, 1990, Spekman et al, 1998) has used Likert scales because of their \nappropriateness, their simplicity and business people\u2019s general familiarity with them \n(Schertzer & Kernan, 1985), the method was selected for this project.  The use of scales \n   13\nrequired familiarity with a number of considerations including whether or not the descriptors \n(the words used to describe the question choices) have similar psychological meanings to \npeople and thus can be arranged to form equal-interval response scales (Schertzer & Kernan, \n1985). \n \n 115 team leader, semi-structured, face to face interviews took place following the production \nof a quantitative data report for each dyad.  The team leaders were asked to highlight the \nreasons for the situations revealed by the numerical information under each of the 5 \ndimension.  Over 700 key-point phrases were categorised according to the theoretical model \ndimensions and recorded in a database to facilitate analysis.  The data were also classified by \nemergent relationship variables such as trust, commitment and collaborative behaviour. Thus \nit was possible to determine not only the broad statistical trends but also some of the \nunderlying reasoning.  Special attention was devoted to providing feedback to the research \nparticipants by means of individual relationship reports as well as head office and web-based \nsummaries of the research findings.  An unforeseen consequence was the high value ascribed \nby many of the organisations to the production of independent, frank relationship information \nwhich gave us increased confidence in the validity of the data supplied by the respondents.  \nWe also learned that in many cases relationship maintenance arrangements received a much-\nneeded boost as a result. \n \nGeneral Findings \n \nWe found that our theoretical model proved to be a particularly powerful tool that clearly \nrevealed a pattern of recognisable relationship characteristics within the business \nenvironment studied.  When populated with quantitative and qualitative research data, it was \nclearly noticeable that instead of an intrinsically negative hypothesis, a spectrum of \ndynamics, including many described in the literature from competitive markets, was found.  \nMoreover, it was interesting to note how managers had developed specific measures and \nbehaviours to cope with their reduced options.  The quantitative data findings (aggregated \nmean success scores per dimension) shown in Figure 3 revealed that the essentially negative \nOrganisations Failure Framework was not so in practice with an overall mean success rating \nof 57%. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n1.

Theoretical Model Overall Mean Success Scores by \nDimension  \n   14\n \n \n \nThese results agreed with the 54 individual relationship success statistics where 42 (77.7%) \nscored 50% or better satisfaction ratings.  Also, although MoD teams are less optimistic \n(59%) than Firms (67%), this difference is not statistically significant with a high correlation \nfactor of 0.928.  Our preliminary examination of a sub-set of the data shows that \ncollaborative behaviours (we termed the effect of co-operation, co-ordination and \ncollaboration within this research as C3 Behaviour - see next section \u201cImplications for \nTheory\u201d for further explanation of this effect) appear to have a strong bearing on the levels of \nsuccess in the relationships surveyed ie. 64% compared to the overall research rating of 57% \n(correlation 0.983).  This situation is illustrated in the table at Appendix 1 where the research \ndimension relationship satisfaction ratings by dimension are contrasted with those from the \nC3 data sub-set and illustrated with selected semi-structured interview key-points. \n \nImplications for Theory \n \nContrary to expectations, a diversity of positive, business-driven behaviours was present \nwithin the UK Defence supply chain environment as well as more adverse small \nnumbers\/restricted market dynamics suggested by the theoretical framework.  Difficulties in \nachieving effective Supply Chain Management (Christopher, 2005) implementation could be \ntraced to the normal, commercial difficulties surrounding order book performance, joint \nobjectives and service level systems framework (Boddy et al, 2000, Fawcett & Mangan, \n2002, Humphries & Wilding, 2004b, Lamming, 1993, Tompkins, 2000).  UK Defence \n\u2018Environmental\u2019 problems such as old products, obsolescence, staff and organisational \nupheavals, poor end-customer visibility and lack of investment in modern procedures and \nsystems seemed to accentuate managers\u2019 frustrations due to lack of freedom of action and we \ndeduce, could promote the relationship negativity implied by the theoretical framework. As \npredicted by the model, lack of investment in specific assets such as work force stability and \nproduct\/process development, the use of inadequate performance measures, opportunistically \nproviding poor goods and services and, using proprietary information as a weapon, appeared \nto reduce the chances of achieving positively oriented, interdependence and perceptions of \nequitable outcomes.   \n \nOn the other hand despite the adverse small numbers\/restricted market influences \nencountered, strong counterbalancing, positive business drivers were likely to produce \nexamples of relationship-building, specific investments, co-operative behaviour, open \ncommunications and a desire to reduce the burden of governance through more equitable, \nlong-term arrangements. Humphries & Wilding, (2004a) and Spekman et al (1998) suggest \nthat co-operative, co-ordinating and collaborative behaviours involve working \ntogether\/jointly to bring resources into a required relationship to achieve effective operations \nin harmony with the strategies\/objectives of the parties involved, thus resulting in mutual \nbenefit.  Spekman posed the view, as shown in Figure 4, that a shift in the level of intensity \nbetween partners was necessary. Co-operation, where firms exchanged essential information \nand engaged some suppliers\/customers in longer-term contracts, was the \u2018threshold\u2019 level of \ninteraction. The next was co-ordination where both workflow and information were \nexchanged to make many of the traditional linkages between and among trading parties \nseamless. Collaborative behaviour engaged partners in joint planning and processes beyond \nlevels reached in less intense trading relationships.   \n \n   15\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe felt that these factors came into play in many of the relationships we examined both \nindividually and in combination because the sequence may occur in different aspects in \ndifferent timescales.  Hence we felt that it was justifiable to describe a form of partnership-\nenhancing behaviour (C3) that combined all three. \n \nMcDonald et al (1997) and, Moorman et al (1992) view C3 behaviour as similar or \ncomplementary, co-ordinated actions needed to achieve mutual outcomes with reciprocation \nover time and rather than pure exchange, are used to create real value as an organisational \ncompetence know as \u2018collaborative advantage\u2019.  Morgan & Hunt (1994) and Oliver (1990) \ndescribe the importance of pursuing mutually beneficial interests but additionally emphasise \nthe fundamentally co-operative nature of business life characterised by balance and harmony. \nMoreover this powerful combination of behavioural variables can often lead to the discovery \nof even more successful ways to co-operate and new objects of co-operation (Doz & \nBaburoglu, 2000).  C3 Behaviour is therefore essential to maintaining a successful business \npartnership (Metcalf et al, 1992, Rugman & D\u2019Cruz, 2000), especially when linked with \ncommitment to the achievement of shared, realistic goals (Lewin & Johnston, 1997, Sheth & \nSharma, 1997).  As already mentioned, in the quantitative data analysis C3 Behaviour \nappeared to make a strong contribution to relationship success.  However; effectiveness could \nbe reduced when the sincerity of the other party\u2019s intentions was doubted.  The \noverwhelming majority of respondents placed strong emphasis on personal relationships \n(\u2018hitting it off\u2019) (Gulati, 1995, Kemppainen & Vepsalainen, 2003) and culture-matching \n(\u2018relating to the way the other side do things\u2019) (Moss Kanter, 1994). This counters the \nenlightened, self-interest approach (Faulkner, 2000) and underlines the central importance of \ncommitment and trust to relationship stability and productiveness (Morgan and Hunt, 1994).  \nExcellent, long-term commercial arrangements, frequent, interactive, open communications, \nand constructive conflict that supported repeated cycles of exchange, risk-taking and \nsuccessful fulfilment of expectations were also described as important contributors (Doney & \nCannon, 1997).  These appeared to strengthen the willingness of parties to rely upon each \nother and to develop adaption and interdependence (Eisenhardt et al, 1997, Madhok, 2000). \nHowever, opportunistic behaviour such as adversarial bidding, inflexible and unduly \nbureaucratic commercial practices, unwillingness to share proprietary data and uncaring use \nof power were clearly evident and potentially capable of undermining relationship-building \n(Humphries & Wilding, 2003, Faulkner & de Rond, 2000, Palmer, 2001).  \n \nOpen \nMarket \nNegotiations \n \nCo-operation \n \nCo-ordination \n \nCollaboration \n \n\u2022 Price-based discussions \n\u2022 Adversarial relationships \n \n\u2022 Fewer suppliers \n\u2022 Longer-term contracts \n \n\u2022 Information links \n\u2022 WIP links \n\u2022 EDI exchange \n \n\u2022 Supply chain integration \n\u2022 Joint planning \n\u2022 technology sharing \nFigure 4. Supply Chain Transition from Adversarial to Collaborative \nRelationships (adapted from Spekman et al, 1998) \n   16\nThe literature says comparatively based on empirical research about the relationship \ndynamics within long-term, closely collaborative, dyadic relationships.  We hypothesised that \nthis proximity could generate both positive and negative feedback behaviours.  Our research \ndetected a spectrum of these phenomena and that managers in many cases clearly understood \nthe limitations on their freedom and were employing C3 behaviours to improve the \nperformance of their partnerships.  The literature is generally aware of these dynamics but \nour contribution to theory is a research methodology that allows them to be exposed in an \nintegrated manner and comes close to providing a balance of results using Giannakis & \nCroom\u2019s (2004) \u20183S\u2019 SCM paradigm conceptual framework. \n \nResearch Limitations - Theoretical  \n \nWe acknowledge that we have taken a somewhat unusual approach to examining \ncollaborative, long-term supply chain relationships and have integrated the variables in \nWilliamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure Framework in an innovative way.  We also realise \nthat using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data is inevitably a compromise \nbetween the extremes of imposing rationality on the data collection and interpretation and, \nallowing the data to emerge and speak for itself.  The research has used a narrow view \nthrough a specific theoretical model lens to achieve a broad understanding of business \nrelationships within a single, albeit large, organisation.  However, the theoretical model \nproved to be a powerful research tool that allowed, in a fairly simple and straight-forward \nway, a comprehensive breadth of organisational dynamics to be revealed.   It is thus essential \nto view the value of the research only through this restricted gap and to accept that further \nresearch in other settings and using alternative methods will be needed to triangulate its \nfindings and assess its wider generalisability. \n \nImplications for Practice \nOur research has thus highlighted a number of important lessons for managers operating \nwithin the UK Defence Procurement organisations.  There is a need to accept that the closely \ncollaborative, long-term supply chain relationships inevitably put pressure on relationships \nbecause compromises that reduce freedom of action cannot be avoided.  However, they can \nreduce sources of frustration that generate negative behaviours by taking joint actions to seek \ninnovative ways of dealing with \u2018environmental\u2019 problems such as old products, \nobsolescence, staff and organisational upheavals, poor end-customer visibility and lack of \ninvestment in modern procedures and systems.   Central to achieving this is C3 Behaviour \nwhere setting synchronised objectives, pursuing joint approaches to service and product \ndelivery, lowering costs and risks and promoting measures to support the growth of trust \nappear to be the best ways of halting negative behaviour spirals. \n \nConclusion  \n \nWe set out to explore a little known area of business relationships using simple but powerful \nanalytical methods.  The prime contribution of this exploratory research is the exposure of \nrelationship dynamics within a large sample of long-term, collaborative supply chain business \ndyads using an integrated application of Williamson\u2019s (1975) Organisations Failure \nFramework.   We conclude that the methodology provides a powerful tool to allow objective \ndata to be collected and rich perspectives to be taken from its exploration.  We found that by \nexamining a group of relationships within UK Defence sector we were able to focus on those \naspects that that occurred because of their very close proximity.  These were clearly \nrecognisable from the existing literature but, their combination in the research setting was \n   17\nnew.  We were surprised to find that C3 (co-operative, co-ordinating, collaborative) played an \nimportant part in counteracting the potentially negative behaviour spiral influences within \nlong-term, close collaborations.  The lessons for UK Defence Supply Chain managers suggest \na number of positive measures that can be applied to improve relationship performance in a \nstrategically important public\/private business domain. Exploration of the theoretical \nframework dimensions using other relational variables such as trust, commitment and long-\nterm orientation could cross-tabulate and extend the original findings. The project necessarily \ntook a high-level, snapshot of the phenomena in view.  Longitudinal approaches, action and \nexperimental research methods, use of alternative theoretical fields such as sociology and \norganisational dynamics, especially using international comparisons, could provide extremely \ninteresting and useful, in-depth results.  It would be particularly interesting to see if the \nfindings were applicable to other market sector, long-term collaborative relationships.  It \nshould be emphasised that none of these opportunities for research should be viewed in \nisolation.  Many of them overlap and converge to offer the chance to carry out integrated \nresearch programmes. \n \n. \n \n \n \n   18\n \nAppendix 1 \u2013 C3 Behaviour Research Data \n \nDimension & \nResearch \nScore \nNegative Definition C3 \nScore \n2nd Level Construct Exemplar Semi-Structured \nInterview Key Points \nThe relationship \nencourages the \nachievement of high \nperformance by both \nparties ie. reliable \nequipment, on-time \ndelivery, good \nforecasts.  \n\u2018As a result of working through the \nproblems together, customer \nsatisfaction appears to be \nimproving\u2019 \n \n \n1 \u2013 Bounded \nRationality \n(Relationship \nCreativity) \u2013 \n59% \nPeople have only so \nmuch capacity to \nrationalise what is \ngoing on around \nthem and they \ntherefore naturally \nlimit their \nperformance to the \nadequate rather than \nthe optimum \n(Simon, 1957) \n68% \nWhen an unexpected \nproblem arises, both \nparties would rather \nwork out a solution \nthan hold each other to \nthe original contract \nterms. \n\u2018When we were able to focus \ntogether on an emergency \nprogramme to replace defective, \nsafety-critical items, the Company \ninitially found it hard but after that \nit really worked well\u2019 \n\u2018We work closely and most \nsuccessfully with a small team and \nhave a healthy, open relationship\u2019 \nBoth parties co-\noperate \nwholeheartedly. \n \u2018As the reputation of the team for \nsuccess within the business has \ngrown, this has helped to boost the \nconfidence of the members and \nspurred them on to further \nachievements \n\u2018We offered to remove components \nprior to a return to works \nprogramme which their engineers \napproved and believed would save \nus \u00a32m.
