The debt-resource-hypothesis suggests that high indebtedness leads to\nincreased natural resource exploitation as well as more unsustainable patterns of resource\nuse. Countries with high debt burdens supposedly increase their extraction of fossil fuels\nand mineral resources as well as their production of so-called cash crops in order to\nservice their debt obligations. In spite of its popularity, there have been few attempts to\nsystematically test the hypothesis. Existing analyses refer to deforestation only and come\nto mixed results. This study fills a gap in testing the hypothesis more comprehensively\nfor 23 natural resources and cash crops. It uses first differencing, period-specific time\ndummies, and a lagged dependent variable tomitigate omitted variable bias. No evidence\nis found that would support the debt-resource-hypothesis.\n1. Introduction\nMany environmentalists believe that the high indebtedness of developing\ncountries triggers increased exploitation and more unsustainable use of\ntheir natural resources. Indeed, the validity of what we will refer to as\nthe debt-resource-hypothesis, or the DRH for short, seems to be taken for\ngranted by many as a matter of fact. In this article we will attempt to test\nthe DRH quantitatively and we fail to find evidence in its favour. Whilst\nnot providing a conclusive proof against the DRH, our results shed doubt\non its validity and should warn environmentalists and policy makers alike\nagainst believing too easily that high indebtedness spurs exploitation of\nnatural resources.\nAstonishingly, in spite of its popularity, there have been few attempts to\nsystematically empirically test the DRH. There only seem to exist studies\nexamining the link between debt and deforestation, but none that looks at\nother forms of natural resource exploitation. Indeed, even more generally,\nPearce et al. (1995: 29) contend that \u2018the impact of indebtedness on other\nenvironmental indicators such as pollution, biodiversity or depletion of\nother resources has not been tested\u2019. This article cannot address pollution\nor biodiversity loss, but it attempts to fill the gap in the literature with\nI would like to thank two anonymous referees as well as Steve Gibbons, Marten\nGoos, Alan Manning and Michele Pellizzari for many helpful suggestions.\n128 Eric Neumayer\nrespect to natural resources, namely subsoil fuel and mineral resources as\nwell as export-oriented agricultural crops, so-called cash crops. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first study testing theDRHon a comprehensive\nrange of natural resources. It thus complements the existing studies on the\nlink between indebtedness and deforestation.\nWe start with an illustration of the widespread popularity of the DRH\nand a presentation of the reasons why high indebtedness might increase\nresource exploitation. After a review of the existing empirical literature and\na discussion of our research design we report results that are subjected to a\nrange of sensitivity tests. In the light of the reported results, the concluding\nsection warns against taking the DRH simply for granted, but also cautions\nagainst taking our results as definite proof against the hypothesis.\n2. The potential impact of indebtedness on resource exploitation\nWhilst existing empirical studies seem to have exclusively focused on\ndeforestation, the DRH is certainly not confined to deforestation in the\neyes of its proponents. Calvert and Calvert (1999: 9), for example, suggest\ndebt to be \u2018a driving force leading to overexploitation of soil and subsoil\nresources in the process of seeking tomaximize foreign exchange earnings\u2019.\nSimilarly broadly, George (1989: 156) argues that high debts are repayed \u2018by\ncashing innatural resources\u2019. ThePhilippine\u2019s Freedom fromDebtCoalition\nbelieves that its country\u2019s indebtedness leads to \u2018destroying our forests to\nexport wood, ruining our coral reefs to export fish, and exhausting our soils\nby applying heavy pesticides and chemical fertilizers to facilitate export-\noriented agriculture\u2019 (cited in De la Court, 1992: 92).1 The DRH has even\nbeen adopted by official bodies. It has been taken on board by, for example,\nthe World Commission on Environment and Development (the so-called\nBrundtland Commission). Its famous \u2018Our Common Future\u2019 report states\nthat \u2018debtors are being required to use trade surpluses to service debts,\nand are drawing heavily on non-renewable resources to do so\u2019 (WCED,\n1987: 18). Even more drastically, the Commission maintains that \u2018debts that\nthey cannotpay forceAfricannations relyingon commodity sales to overuse\ntheir fragile soils, thus turning good land to desert\u2019 (ibid.: 6).\nThe DRH has been particularly popular amongst environmentalist\ngroups. The US branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), for\nexample, warns that \u2018demand for foreign exchange to service debts. . .\nhas provided an impetus for developing countries to mine their natural\nresources\u2019 (WWF\u2013US, 2000: 5). Friends of the Earth asked governments\nin the run-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in\nJohannesburg in 2002 \u2018to note that external debt fuels the depletion of\nnatural resources\u2019 (FoE, 2002: 2). The Worldwatch Institute (2001) suggests\nthat \u2018debt pressure has spurred increases in export-oriented mining and\n1 Note that even if the DRH was valid, the environmental implications would\nnot always be clear-cut. For example, the mere swap from crops produced for\ndomestic consumption to cash crops for export purposes need not imply more\nenvironmental degradation, since cash crops such as coffee and cocoa might be\nless environmentally destructive than other non-cash crops such as potatoes or\nmanioc (Gerster, 1992: 233).\nEnvironment and Development Economics 129\nlogging in developing countries\u2019. The Global Legislators Organization for a\nBalanced Environment (GLOBE), an association of members of parliament\nfrom over 100 national parliaments, also maintains that \u2018pressure of debt\nrepayments often causes overexploitation of natural resources\u2019 in their\nresolution to the Johannesburg summit (GLOBE, 2002).\nThe most common explanation of why high indebtedness might trigger\nincreased resource exploitation andmore unsustainable resource use seems\nto be that high indebtedness is seen as forcing countries to earn more and\nspend less in order to finance their debt obligations \u2013 if not a reduction of\ntheir debts, then at least servicing the interest on their debts. As a result,\ndeveloping countries \u2018will give priority to what they can easily produce:\nprimary products that sell at low prices on the world market. They have\nevery incentive to use intensive agriculture to produce cash crops and to\nexhaustmineral resources as quickly as possible\u2019 (Calvert andCalvert, 1999:\n205). Moreover, since many developing countries try to earn higher export\nrevenues via exploiting their natural resources, the proponents of the DRH\nsuggest this is leading to a vicious circle: \u2018With somany jostling for a share of\nlimited world markets, prices plummet, forcing governments to seek ever-\nhigher levels of exports in a desperate attempt to keep their hard currency\nrevenues stable\u2019 (George, 1992: 2).\nThere have also been a few attempts at formally modelling the DRH\n(see, for example, Kahn and McDonald, 1995; Rauscher, 1989, 1990, 1997;\nStrand, 1995, 1997). As the focus of this article is empirical rather than\ntheoretical, we will merely present the main results of these models.\nKahn and McDonald (1995) in their analysis suggest that one needs to\ndemonstratewhyhigh indebtedness should change the rate of deforestation\nif a particular rate was seen as optimal and income maximizing before.\nThey show in a dynamic optimization framework that high indebtedness\nmight drive a wedge between deforestation strategies that are optimal in\nthe short run as opposed to the long run and induce countries to pursue\nmyopic policies resulting in \u2018excessive\u2019 deforestation. The intuition behind\nthis result is that if one assumes that policy makers are constrained in\ntheir inter-temporal trade-off, such that current consumption must not\nfall beyond a certain minimum level, then high levels of indebtedness\ncan induce policy makers to resort to deforestation in order to meet this\nminimum level of consumption. More generally, variables contributing\nto income and therefore to meeting the minimum level of consumption,\nsuch as a high labour force participation rate, decrease deforestation.\nConversely, variables that compete for the use of income (investment,\ngovernment spending, debt service) increase deforestation. Note that their\nmodel has been developed with respect to deforestation, but it is generally\ntransferable to the exploitation of other natural resources. Rauscher\u2019s (1989,\n1990, 1997) dynamic optimization models do not assume a minimum level\nof consumption. Instead he shows how higher indebtedness can lead to\nincreased renewable resource exploitation in the presence of imperfect\ncapital markets. The intuition behind this result is that in imperfect capital\nmarkets the interest rate to be paid on a marginal increase in debt is likely\nto be an increasing function of the existing total debt stock. In other words,\nthe higher the existing debt stock, the higher the marginal cost of being\n130 Eric Neumayer\nindebted. To reduce this cost, natural resource owning countries can resort\nto exploiting their resources more than they would otherwise do in order to\npay back some of the debt. The high initial indebtedness therefore induces\nthe indebted country to deviate from the rate of resource extraction, which\nwould otherwise be socially efficient. In the two-period models of Strand\n(1995, 1997) increased resource exploitation is also shown to be a rational\nresponse of countries with a high level of initial debt in order to reduce new\nborrowing.\n3. Existing empirical evidence\nWhat does the empirical evidence tell us on the DRH? The fervour with\nwhich the DRH is put forward by some of its proponents stands in stark\ncontrast to the lack of systematic empirical evidence in its support. Mostly,\nanecdotal evidence and examples are presented (see, for example, George,\n1989, 1992; Calvert and Calvert, 1999). Susan George believes that with\nrespect to deforestation the figures simply \u2018speak for themselves\u2019 and that\ntherefore no systematic quantitative analysis is needed. George (1992: 9)\nsuggests that:\n\u0001 Third world countries that deforested the most or the fastest in the 1980s\nwere also, on the whole, the largest debtors.\n\u0001 In a number of smaller countries with less significant forest reserves, the\nfastest deforesters were also the most heavily indebted.\n\u0001 Countries with the highest \u2018debt service ratios\u2019 or subject to the highest\nlevels of IMF \u2018conditionality\u2019 also tend to be the largest and fastest\ndeforesters.\nNot all qualitative empirical evidence supports the DRH, however. A\n1992 report commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund (formerly World\nWide Fund for Nature, WWF) consists of three case studies from Co\u02c6te\nd\u2019Ivoire, Mexico, and Thailand (Reed, 1992) and fails to find clear evidence\nin favour of the DRH. For example, with respect to Co\u02c6te d\u2019Ivoire, a country\nwith one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, \u2018the research team\nwas unable to establish any evidence that debt directly aggravated or eased\nenvironmental degradation in general or in the forestry sector in particular\u2019\n(Reed, 1992: 145). Similarly, the Mexican case study failed to provide any\nevidence in favour of the DRH and in the case of Thailand, \u2018although\nrampant deforestation occurred during the mid-1980s, modelling analysis\ndid not suggest that this problem was triggered or accelerated in any direct\nway by national debt obligations\u2019 (Reed, 1992: 146).\nQuantitative econometric analyses exist with respect to deforestation\nonly and they also fail to provide a clear-cut picture.2 Some studies\nprovide evidence in favour of the DRH. For example, Kahn and McDonald\n(1994, 1995) in ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation find a statistically\nsignificant effect of the debt service to export ratio on deforestation\nrates in the period 1981 to 1985. Kant and Redantz (1997: 77) find no\n2 Note that we can only review studies here, which included a variable of in-\ndebtedness. For reviewsof quantitative studies ofdeforestationmoregenerally, see\nAngelsen and Kaimowitz (1999) and Barbier (2001).\nEnvironment and Development Economics 131\nstatistically significant relation between indebtedness and deforestation\nin Latin America in OLS estimation. Only in maximum likelihood (ML)\nestimation, which can be problematic in small samples (Long and Freese,\n2001: 65), do they find that one million US$ of debt typically leads to 8.4\nhectares of annual deforestation inAsia and 27.2 hectares of deforestation in\nLatin America. Capistrano (1994) and Capistrano and Kiker (1995), on the\nother hand, find in OLS estimation that a higher debt service to export ratio\nis associatedwith less rather thanmore forest depletion for the period 1972\u2013\n1975 only and is not statistically significantly related to forest depletion\nduring either 1967\u20131971, 1976\u20131980, or 1981\u20131985. Shafik (1994) also finds\ndebt per capita to be highly insignificant in his OLS estimation analysis\nof the average annual rate of deforestation over the period 1962\u20131986. A\ncouple of other, often unpublished, studies also provide rather ambiguous\nevidence, as summarized in Angelsen and Kaimowitz (1999).\nOverall, therefore, the existing evidence for the DRH is limited and\nrather inconclusive (for a similar conclusion see, for example, Barrow,\n1995: 291 and Pearce et al., 1995). Most importantly, it is confined to\nexamining deforestation. The following sections therefore try to test the\nDRH systematically for a wide range of other natural resources, thus\ncomplementing the existing literature on deforestation.\n4. Research design\nTo estimate the underlying causal mechanisms or driving forces behind\nnatural resource exploitation is a very difficult task because of two\nproblems. First, on a conceptual level, it is not entirely clear which factors\ncan be expected to drive exploitation. Even for deforestation, the topic that\nhas attracted most attention, there is no agreement on which factors should\nbe included. Most would include population growth\/density, macro-\neconomic variables such as income, trade openness, and the real exchange\nrate, as well as variables relating to wood production and agriculture\n(subsidies, productivity, export value). But there is no consensus on which\nvariables need to be included and how they should be defined. If anything,\nmodelling the determinants of exploitation of a wide range of natural\nresources is even more complicated than modelling the determinants\nof deforestation, which might be one of the reasons for the focus\non deforestation in existing studies. Second, on a practical level, many\nof the variables, which theoretical analysis might suggest as important\ndeterminants, are not available at all or only for a few countries and for\nsmall time periods. A country\u2019s extraction of natural resources is likely to be\na function of numerous factors besides a country\u2019s extent of indebtedness.\nSuch factors include the total reserve stock and resource discoveries, the\nquality of the mineral ore, fossil fuel deposit, or the productivity of land,\nthe availability or emergence of substitute resources, capital and labour\ncosts, the state of extraction technology, the size of the domestic market,\nthe costs of transportation to foreign markets, the real effective exchange\nrate, and the existence of producer cartels such as the Organization of\nPetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) or theAssociation of Tin Producing\nCountries. It will also be affected by political interventions such as taxation\nand subsidies, price and exchange rate controls, environmental and trade\n132 Eric Neumayer\nregulations, the type of ownership (government or private, domestic,\nor multinational), political events, and strikes (Siebert, 1985; Rees, 1990;\nDobozi, 1993). State ownership of the resource is an important variable,\nas such ownership makes it easier to channel the profits from resource\nexploitation directly into repaying public debts. Dobozi (1993) provides\nevidence from the copper industry that suggests that governmentsuse state-\nowned copperminingfirms as amacroeconomic tool to copewith balance of\npayments difficulties. However, the share of state ownership is impossible\nto establish for manymarkets. More generally, there can be no pretence that\nthe factors determining resource exploitation could be adequately included\nin empirical estimation. As a consequence of both problems, empirical tests\nof theDRHare likely to suffer from omitted variable bias if the debt variable\nis correlated with one or more omitted variables.\nPanel data estimation techniques are ideally suited for mitigating the\nproblem of omitted variables. With panel data, the technique of first\ndifferencing the data can wipe out any time-invariant country effect, which\neliminates already one important source of potential omitted variable\nbias. Period-specific dummy variables account for temporal changes\nin worldwide demand for natural resources such that the potential\nsimultaneous increase in resource exploitation and indebtedness over time\ndoes not result in spurious regression results. Most importantly, as Nair-\nReichert and Weinhold (2001: 162) note, panel data analysis allows the\ninclusion of a lagged dependent variable, which provides \u2018an excellent\nproxy variable for many omitted variables\u2019 as these variables are likely\nto be strongly correlated with the lagged dependent variable (see also\nFinkel, 1995). In addition, since panel data draw upon both cross-sectional\nand over-time variation in the data, one can capture both an \u2018acute\u2019\nand a \u2018chronic\u2019 potential effect of indebtedness on resource exploitation.3\nThe \u2018acute\u2019 effect would show in the dynamics of resource exploitation\nover time, with an increase in indebtedness triggering increased resource\nexploitation. The \u2018chronic\u2019 effect would show in the cross-sectional\ndimension of the data as highly indebted countries would have higher\nresource exploitation at any moment of time.\nWe therefore estimate the following dynamic model for each resource\nPit = \u03b1 + \u03b3tTt + \u03b4Pi\u22121 + \u03c61Xit + \u03c62Xit\u22121 + \u0005i t , where \u0005i t = ui + vit.\nPit and Pit\u22121 is production (extraction) in country i in period t and\nt\u2212 1, respectively. The Tt capture any period specific effects not included\nin the regressors, for example temporal changes in worldwide demand\nfor the resource. As mentioned above, Pit\u22121 can function as a proxy\nof omitted variables. In addition, it can also account for inter-temporal\npersistence (\u2018sluggishness\u2019) in resource extraction. TheXit and Xit\u22121 include\nour explanatory vairables, namely the extent of indebtedness as our major\nvariable of interest as well as possibly other control variables. Inclusion\nof the two terms together allows for both a current as well as lagged effect\n3 Such a distinction between \u2018acute\u2019 and \u2018chronic\u2019 effect is inspired by epidemiology.\nI am thankful to an anonymous referee for suggesting it.\nEnvironment and Development Economics 133\nof the debt variable on resource production. We use different specificat-\nions of the lag length as well as the type of lag included in sensitivity\nanalysis. The ui are supposed to capture any country specific time-invariant\neffects not included in the explanatory variables.\nEstimating equation (1) with either OLS or a fixed-effects or first-\ndifferenced panel estimator is problematic. This is because of the inclusion\nof the lagged dependent variable as a regressor. Since Pit is a function of ui,\nso is Pit\u22121. The correlation of a regressorwith the error term renders theOLS\nestimator both biased and inconsistent. The same is true for the fixed-effects\nor first-differenced estimator, as first noted by Nickell (1981) and Anderson\nand Hsiao (1981). Whilst in the process of estimation the ui are wiped out,\nbiasedness and inconsistency is a consequence of the correlation between\nPit\u22121 and vit\u22121 (Baltagi, 1995: 126).\nThere are twoways to estimate equation (1)without bias and consistently.\nOne is to follow Anderson and Hsiao (1981) and to use a two-stage least\nsquares (2SLS) first-differenced estimator, that is, a first differenced esti-\nmator with instrumental variables. First differencing wipes out the ui\nand using either Pit\u22122 or \u0006Pit\u22122 (that is, Pit\u22122 \u2212 Pit\u22123) as an instrument\nfor Pit\u22121 solves the problem since neither instrument is correlated with\n\u0006vit. In addition, further lags can be included. Alternatively, one can use\nthe so-called Arellano and Bond (1991) Generalized Method of Moments\nestimator. The basic idea of this estimator is to use all prior dependent\nvariables that are valid instruments, not just Pit\u22122. We will use the Arellano\nand Bond dynamic panel estimator for the main estimations and the 2SLS\nfirst-differenced estimator in sensitivity analysis.When employing the 2SLS\nfirst-differenced estimator we follow Arellano\u2019s (1989) advice and use the\nlevels Pit\u22122 and Pit\u22123 rather than the differences \u0006Pit\u22122 and \u0006Pit\u22123 as\ninstruments. In sensitivity analysis, we further use a fixed-effects estimator,\na random-effects estimator, which draws upon both cross-sectional and\nover-time variation in the data, and a between estimator, which is purely\ncross-sectional.\nNatural resource extraction data in thousand metric tons for bauxite,\ncopper, gold, hardcoal, iron, lead, lignite, natural gas, nickel, oil, phosphate,\nsilver, tin, and zinc are taken from World Bank (2001a). Production data in\nthousand metric tons for the following most important cash crops come\nfrom FAO (2002): bananas, cashew nuts, cocoa beans, coffee, cotton, natural\nrubber, soybeans, sugar cane, tea, and tobacco.4 Whilst the FAO data cover\npractically all countries in the world, some very small countries are missing\nfrom the World Bank data set. Estimations refer to countries with some\npositive amount of extraction of a natural resource or production of a\ncash crop only. It is clear that our dependent variable captures the level\nof resource extraction, but covers unsustainable resource use only to the\n4 We did not use net export data as for some natural resources no such data were\navailable or are less reliable than production data. However, there is a very strong\ncorrelation between production and export of natural resources since the domestic\nmarket can only take up a very limited amount of these products, beyond which\nany production increases need to be exported. It is in the nature of these products\nthat they are mainly produced for export.\n134 Eric Neumayer\nextent that increased extraction goes hand in hand with unsustainable\nresource use. The problem is that there are no international data available,\nindicating the sustainability of resource use.\nOur data cover the period 1979\u20131999, but the first two years are lost in the\nprocess of estimation due to the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable\nand the need for instrumenting it. We use the net present value of the total\ndebt service to exports ratio as our variable of indebtedness in the main\nanalysis and three other variables in sensitivity analysis: first, the total debt\nservice to gross national income ratio; second, the total debt stock to exports\nratio; third, the total debt stock to the gross national income ratio. Apart\nfrom the net present value of total debt service to exports ratio, which is\ncomputed byEasterly (2001), all variables are taken fromWorldBank (2000).\nTo control for the effect of endowments on natural resource extraction and\nproduction, we use estimates of the available reserve stock for the energy\nand mineral resources. Data are taken from a variety of sources, including\nWRI (various years), US Bureau ofMines (various years), British Petroleum\n(various years), and OPEC (various years). Note that no data for silver\nand gold reserves could be established. For cash crops no crop-specific\nendowment data are available. As an admittedly crude proxy, we use the\npercentage of a country\u2019s land area that is considered arable, with data\ntaken from World Bank (2001b). In sensitivity analysis, we replaced this\nvariable with the share of permanent cropland as a percentage of arable\nland, without finding any major change of results.\nAs further control variables, we included the real effective exchange rate\nand the gross domestic product (GDP) in constant US$ prices of 1995 as\na proxy for domestic market size. Following Kahn and McDonald (1994,\n1995), as discussed in the section above, we also included the labour\nforce participation rate, the gross domestic investment rate, and the ratio\nof government spending to GDP, even though we find their theoretical\nargument for the inclusion of these variables not compelling. Apart from\nthe exchange rate data,whichwere taken from IMF (various years), all other\ndata came from World Bank (2001b). As control variables specific for each\nresource, we used very crude estimates of the unit resource rent for fossil\nfuel and mineral resources (World Bank, 2001a) and the unit export value\nfor cash crops (FAO, 2002). Due to gaps in data availability, these further\ncontrol variables are included in sensitivity analysis only in order to keep\nthe sample size for the main estimations as large as possible.\n5. Results\nTable 1 presents the estimates for all energy and mineral resources. Table 2\npresents the results for the cash crops. Estimations are based on the\nArellano\u2013Bond dynamic panel estimator with the indebtedness variable\nentered both contemporaneously as well as in lagged form. As mentioned\nabove, to have the greatest sample possible, indebtedness and endowments\nare the only explanatory variables other than the lagged dependent variable\nin these estimations. In sensitivity analysis, we entered the other control\nvariables as well. For the estimates to be consistent, it is important that\nthere is no second-order autocorrelation.

Even in the cases of bauxite, gas, and zinc, the hypothesis\nfails to become rejected at the more demanding 5 per cent level. Note that\none of the indebtedness variables tests significantly only in two cases out\nof the 23 estimations reported in tables 1 and 2. For both bauxite and\ntobacco, the estimated effect of indebtedness on production is actually\nnegative, which would contradict the DRH. More importantly, there is not\na single case where the indebtedness variable is estimated significantly\nin concordance with the DRH. Even the combined p-value is above the\n10 per cent confidence level in all cases but coffee.\nThe endowment variables are statistically significant with the expected\npositive sign only in few cases. For two minerals the estimated coefficient\nis significant with a negative sign. The most likely reason for this failure to\ntest more in accordance with expectation is that for most mineral resources\nthe reserve stock data are derived from rather crude estimates that change\nlittle over time. They are therefore subject tomeasurement error. In asmuch\nas they change little over time, they are also captured to a great extent by\nthe country-specific fixed effects. It is notable that the reserve stock variable\nis significant with the expected positive sign for the cases of gas, oil, and\nhardcoal, for which reserve stock estimates are generally better available.\nThe percentage of arable land is never statistically significant in the cash\ncrop estimations. This variable hardly changes over time and is therefore\nalready captured by the country-specific effects such that its effect is almost\nwiped out in the process of estimation. This is not problematic in our context\nsince we merely want to control for the effect of endowments, but have no\nfurther interest in their effect on resource extraction.\n6. Sensitivity analysis\nGiven the importance of the DRH and the rather striking results from\ntable 1 and table 2 failing to find any evidence in its favour, the results\nwere subjected to a whole battery of sensitivity analyses.5 For example, the\nresults reported in these tables remain valid if one of the other proxies for\na country\u2019s indebtedness \u2013 the total debt service to gross national income,\ntotal debt stock to exports, total debt stock to gross national income \u2013 is\nused instead. The same is true if the variables are entered in combination\nwith each other. Results remain valid if the variables are entered in logged\nform. Introducing the other control variables does not change results\neither. Results also remain valid if the 2SLS first-differenced estimator\nis used instead of the Arellano\u2013Bond estimator, if no lags are used or\nfurther lags are included, if instead of lagged debt variables, which create\nproblems with multicollinearity, moving averages are used that include the\ncontemporaneous value and two prior years.\nWhilst instrumenting the lagged dependent variable avoids its cor-\nrelation with the error term, the estimation can be very inefficient if the\ninstruments areweak. In otherwords, estimation is inefficient if further lags\nare bad predictors of the lagged dependent variables. Researchers therefore\n5 Detailed results are available from the author upon request.\n138 Eric Neumayer\nsometimes estimate models such as equation (1) with a fixed-effects or first-\ndifferenced estimator without using instruments, trading off biasedness\nagainst inefficiency. If we do so, our results do not change. Sometimes,\nresearchers even hesitate to include a lagged dependent variable as it\nabsorbs much of the variation in the data, leaving little to the other\nindependent variables. However, our results did not change if the lagged\ndependent variable is dropped from the model, which is then estimated\nwith a fixed-effects or first-differenced estimator. The same is true if the\nmodel is estimated with a random-effects or between estimator.\nIn eachof these sensitivity tests, naturally it happens that invery fewcases\nthe proxy variable for indebtedness assumes some marginal significance,\nsometimes with a positive sign, sometimes with a negative sign. However,\nwith hundreds of estimations undertaken this is of course not further\nsurprising given the nature of hypothesis testing with confidence intervals.\nThat these few incidences are likely to be down to chance is supported\nby the fact that indebtedness does not become consistently marginally\nsignificant for any specific resource. The major result is therefore robust:\nthere is no evidence for a statistically significant effect of indebtedness on\nnatural resource exploitation.\n7. Conclusion\nThere is a tendency in the applied econometric literature to report analyses\nonly if they have found statistically significant results with respect to the\nvariables of interest. Sometimes, however, the finding that a particular vari-\nable does not have a statistically significant influence on a dependent\nvariable can be equally important. Arguably, this is the case here.We clearly\nfail to reject the hypothesis of no relationship between indebtedness and the\nextent of resource extraction. Our results reported above therefore fail to\nprovide evidence for the DRH.We did not find evidence that countries with\nhigher debt levels or higher debt service burdens have higher exploitation\nof subsoil fossil fuel and mineral resources or higher production of cash\ncrops than other countries.\nOur findings support the doubt expressed by others \u2013 for example, Reed\n(1992), Barrow (1995), and Pearce et al. (1995) \u2013 with respect to the\nvalidity of the DRH. It should warn us against accepting the DRH too\neasily. The widespread popularity of the hypothesis stands in stark contrast\nto the rather shaky empirical evidence it is built upon. Equally well,\nhowever, one must warn against taking the results as definite proof against\nthe DRH. To start with, due to data constraints, we cannot really assess\nwhether higher indebtedness has prompted countries to resort to more\nunsustainable resource use without an increase in the level of resource\nextraction. It is unlikely that a switch to (more) unsustainable resource\nuse would not be accompanied by higher resource exploitation, but its\npossibility cannot be ruled out either. Further, as mentioned already, testing\nthe determinants of natural resource exploitation is a complicated task,\nrendered difficult by conceptual uncertainty and poor data availability.\nFirst differencing, inclusion of year-specific time dummies and a lagged\ndependent variable can mitigate omitted variable bias, but it cannot fully\navoid it. If indebtedness is correlated with variables that are still omitted,\nEnvironment and Development Economics 139\nthen our results can be biased. Furthermore, our resource endowment data\nare rather crude and often subject to measurement error. Perhaps there are\nlimits to large-scale quantitative testing of such hypotheses. But our results\ndemonstrate that there is no systematic quantitative evidence for the DRH,\nthe validity of which is simply taken as a given by many.\nOne might wonder whether it really matters that there is little evidence\nfor the DRH. Shilling (1992: 28) believes it does, since continued belief\nin the DRH in spite of the absence of empirical evidence in its favour \u2018is\npotentially dangerous, because it confuses the causes and cures, and thus,\nif acted upon, might lead to inequitable solutions, validate inappropriate\nbehaviour, and create moral hazards\u2019. Debt forgiveness, for example, might\nbe desirable for any number of other reasons, but this analysis has shown\nthat there is no reason to expect that it will lead to reduced natural resource\nexploitation.\nReferences\nAnderson, T.W. and C.
