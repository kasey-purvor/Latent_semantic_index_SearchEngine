INTRODUCTION\nIt is increasingly recognized that a large group of phys-\nical systems can be characterized as driven, dissipative,\nout-of-equilibrium and having a conservation law or laws\n(see the comprehensive treatments of [1, 2]). They usu-\nally have many degrees of freedom (d.o.f.), or excited\nmodes, and long range correlations leading to scaling or\nmultiscaling. Two examples are fully developed turbu-\nlence (see e.g. [3, 4]) and Self- Organized Criticality\n(SOC, [5\u20137]).\nThe SOC paradigm has found particular resonance\nwith workers attempting to model, and understand,\n\u2018bursty\u2019, scale free transport and energy release in mag-\nnetized plasmas (for a recent review, see, for example\n[8]). Simplified avalanche models have been proposed,\nand points of contact with the data investigated, in the\nastrophysical context; most notably to describe magne-\ntospheric activity ([9\u201312], see also the review [13] and\nrefs. therein), the dynamics of the solar corona (e.g.\n[14\u201317], see also the review [19]), and accretion disks\n(e.g. [20\u201322]). In the context of magnetically confined\nlaboratory plasmas there have been extensive efforts to\nconstruct avalanche models that make points of contact\nwith the system under study, and to establish signatures\ncharacteristic of SOC dynamics in experiments (e.g. [23\u2013\n37]). There have also been attempts to establish whether\nthe signatures of SOC can emerge from magnetohydro-\ndynamic (MHD) or reduced MHD models, (e.g. in the\nsolar coronal context [38, 39]).\nSince the original suggestion of Bak et al in [40] that\nSOC \u201c... could be considered a toy model of general-\nized turbulence\u201d there has been continuing debate on the\npossible relationship of turbulence to SOC [41\u201345]. Sim-\nilarities in the statistical signatures of turbulence, and\nsystems in SOC, have been noted (see e.g. [46, 47]). In\nparticular, it has recently been argued in the context of\nastrophysical plasmas that SOC and turbulence are as-\npects of a single underlying physical process (see [48, 49]\nand references therein). However, the extent to which\nSOC, as opposed to turbulence, uniquely captures the\nobserved dynamics in magnetically confined laboratory\nplasmas (see [50\u201352]) or is indeed consistent with it (see\n[53, 54]) has been brought into question. Key observ-\nables such as power law distributions of patches are not\nunique to SOC systems (for an example see [55], also the\ncomprehensive discussion in [1]).\nOur focus here is then to establish the macroscopic\nsimilarities and differences between turbulence and SOC\nin the most general sense. A central idea in physics is\nthat complex and otherwise intractable behavior may be\nquantified by a few measurable macroscopic control pa-\nrameters. In fluid turbulence, the Reynolds number RE\nexpresses the ratio of driving to dissipation and param-\neterizes the transition from laminar to turbulent flow.\nControl parameters such as the Reynolds number can\nbe obtained from dimensional analysis (see e.g.[3, 56]),\nwithout reference to the detailed dynamics. From this\nperspective the level of complexity resulting from the de-\ntailed dynamics is simply characterized by the number\nN of excited, coupled d.o.f. (or energy carrying modes)\nin the system. The transition from laminar to turbu-\nlent flow then corresponds to an (explosive) increase in\nN . The nature of this transition, the value of the RE at\nwhich it occurs, and the rate at which N grows with RE\nall depend on specific system phenomenology. Dimen-\nsional arguments, along with the assumptions of steady\nstate and energy conservation, are however, sufficient to\ngive the result that N always grows with RE (as in [57],\nsee also [3].\nWe anticipate that an analogous control parameter for\ncomplexity, RA, will exist for the wider group of systems\ndiscussed above. Interestingly it is now known that such\na control parameter that expresses the ratio of driving\nto dissipation does indeed exist for SOC. In this paper\nwe will give a prescription to obtain RA generally from\ndimensional analysis, that is, without reference to the\nrange of detailed and rich phenomenology that any given\nsystem will also exhibit. The rate at which N varies with\nRA is again dependent on this detailed phenomenology.\nWe will see that similarity arguments, along with the\nassumptions of steady state and energy conservation, are\n2however, sufficient to determine whether or not N grows\nwith RA.\nThe question of control parameters in Self-Organized\nCriticality was initially controversial, as the name leads\none to expect. It was originally argued ([5, 40], see also\n[58]) that avalanching systems self organized to the SOC\nstate without a tuning parameter. Subsequent analysis\nhas established a consensus (see [1, 2, 59\u201361, 63]) that\nsome tuning exists, at least in the sense that SOC is a\nlimiting behavior in the driving rate h and the dissipation\nrate \u00b2, such that h\/\u00b2\u2192 0 with h,\u00b2\u2192 0, (and h \u2264 \u00b2, that\nis, a steady state). This understanding is exemplified in\nJensen\u2019s constructive definition as given in [7] of SOC\nas the behavior of \u201cslowly driven interaction dominated\nthresholded\u201d (SDIDT) systems. Clearly then, h\/\u00b2 plays\nthe role of a control parameter. This SDIDT limit h\/\u03b5\u2192\n0 has been investigated extensively (e.g. [60, 61]), most\nrecently with respect to finite size scaling in the limit of\nincreasingly large system size (e.g. [62, 63]).\nHere we are concerned with the relevance to SOC to\nphysically realizable systems, and in particular natural\nones, where the system size is finite and the driving may\nbe unknown and\/or highly variable. Our focus is on pa-\nrameterizing the level of complexity of the system as we\ntake it away from the SDIDT limit by increasing the\ndriver, in a system of large but fixed size. For avalanche\nmodels exhibiting SOC, we will argue that distinct realiz-\nable avalanche sizes play the role of excited d.o.f. of the\nsystem. The SOC state is then characterized by max-\nimal excited d.o.f., that is, avalanches occurring on all\nlengthscales supported by the system. Far from the SOC\nstate, the system becomes ordered with few excited d.o.f.\nand exhibits laminar flow. The SDIDT limit is reached\nby taking RA to zero and we will show that this indeed\nmaximizes the number of excited d.o.f. N . The SDIDT\nlimit is thus in the opposite sense to fluid turbulence\nwhich maximizes N at RE \u2192\u221e.\nThis suggests a possible means to distinguish obser-\nvationally between turbulence and SOC in observations\nand experiments of driven, magnetically confined plas-\nmas. For example, a power law region in the power spec-\ntral density of some quantity that probes the flow is often\nidentified in both laboratory and astrophysical confined\nmagnetized plasmas (e.g. [27\u201330]) and is discussed in the\ncontext of both SOC and turbulence. This power law re-\ngion will always be of finite spatio- temporal range (an\n\u2019inertial range\u2019 of the cascade). Our results imply that\nthis \u2019inertial range\u2019 will decrease as we increase the drive\nfor SOC, whereas it will increase for turbulence- provid-\ning an experimental or observational test to distinguish\nthese phenomena.\nOur relationship between RA and N implies the pos-\nsibility of large but finite N for small but non- zero RA;\nhence an important corollary is that SOC phenomenology\ncan quite generally persist under conditions of finite drive\nin a sufficiently large bandwidth system. This has been\nseen in specific avalanche models (see [64\u201366]). Here,\nsince our result flows from dimensional analysis, we will\nsee that this is a generic property of avalanching systems.\nII. SIMILARITY ANALYSIS AND CONTROL\nPARAMETER\nWe shall focus on how the well-established techniques-\nsimilarity analysis, as described in [56], and the \u03a0-\ntheorem obtained by Buckingham in [67] nearly a cen-\ntury ago can be used to reveal new information about\navalanche models exhibiting SOC (i.e. [1, 5\u20137, 58, 59]).\nThe systems that we have in mind all have strongly\ncoupled excited d.o.f. that transport some quantity from\nthe driving to the dissipation scale. They have the fol-\nlowing properties:\nI. The many excited d.o.f. of the system are coupled;\nthere is some dynamical quantity that freely flows over\nall the excited d.o.f. of the system. We can characterize\na flux \u03b5l of this quantity associated with processes that\noccur on lengthscale l, that is, \u03b5l is the transfer rate of\nthe dynamical quantity through l to neighboring length-\nscales.\nII. The system is not necessarily in equilibrium but is\nin a steady state on the average.\nIII. The dynamical quantity is conserved so that given\n(II) the injection rate \u03b5inj balances the dissipation rate\n\u03b5diss, that is \u03b5inj \u223c \u03b5l \u223c \u03b5diss in an ensemble averaged\nsense.\nIV. The solution is of a scaling type, that is:\nN \u223c\n(\nL0\n\u03b4l\n)\u03b1\n(1)\nwhere \u03b1 > 0 and L0 and \u03b4l are the largest and small-\nest lengthscales respectively that are supported by the\nsystem.\nV. The number of excited d.o.f. can be parameterized\nby a single macroscopic control parameter.\nWe will identify the control parameter for these sys-\ntems in terms of known macroscopic variables by formal\ndimensional analysis (similarity analysis or Buckingham\n\u03a0 theorem, see e.g. [56, 67]). The essential idea is that\nthe system\u2019s behavior is captured by a general function\nF which only depends on the relevant variables Q1..V\nthat describe the system. Since F is dimensionless it\nmust be a function of the possible dimensionless group-\nings, the \u03a01..M (Q1..V ), which can be formed from the\nQ1..V . The (unknown) function F (\u03a01,\u03a02, ..\u03a0M ) is uni-\nversal, describing all systems that depend on the Q1..V\nthrough the \u03a01..M (Q1..V ) and the relationships between\nthem. If one then has additional information about the\nsystem, such as a conservation property, the \u03a01..M (Q1..V )\ncan be related to each other to make F explicit. Thus\nthis method can lead to information about the solution\nof a class of systems where the governing equations are\nunavailable or intractable, often the case for complex sys-\ntems where there are a large number (N here) of strongly\ncoupled d.o.f.. If the V macroscopic variables are ex-\npressed in W physical dimensions (i.e. mass, length,\n3TABLE I: \u03a0 theorem applied to homogeneous turbulence.\nVariable dimension description\nL0 L driving length scale\n\u03b7 L dissipation length scale\nU LT\u22121 bulk (driving) flow speed\n\u03bd L2T\u22121 viscosity\ntime) then there are M = V \u2212W dimensionless group-\nings.\nThe properties I-V above restrict the choice of relevant\nQ1..V . First, we have only specified there is a transfer\nrate on lengthscale l, \u03b5l (property I) of some dynamical\nquantity, its precise nature is irrelevant. Consequently,\nthe only physical dimensions of the transfer rate \u03b5l rele-\nvant to the problem are length and time, so that W = 2.\nSecond, property (V) is that there is a single control pa-\nrameter, \u03a01 which may be expressed as a function of\nthe number of excited degrees of freedom N . To incor-\nporate the scaling property (IV) we will seek solutions\nsuch that \u03a02 = g(L0\/\u03b4l) = f(N). This means that the\nsystem\u2019s behaviour is captured by some F (\u03a01,\u03a02) = C\nwhich fixes M = 2 (C is a constant). The \u03a01 and \u03a02\nare related to each other via properties II and III (con-\nservation and steady state). We then have that V = 4;\nthere are always four relevant macroscopic variables to\nconsider.\nT see this in action, we begin with a relatively well\nunderstood example, namely Kolmogorov (K41) turbu-\nlence. Our aim here is to straightforwardly illustrate the\nabove approach by obtaining the control parameter, the\nReynolds number RE as a function of N via dimensional\nanalysis; for a detailed discussion of the universal scal-\ning properties of K41 turbulence and their origin in the\nNavier Stokes equations see for example [3]. As above, for\nK41 we have four relevant macroscopic variables (given\nin Table 1) and two dimensionless groups:\n\u03a01 =\nUL0\n\u03bd\n= RE , \u03a02 =\nL0\n\u03b7\n= f(N) (2)\n\u03a01 is just the Reynolds number RE of the flow, and the\nratio of lengthscales \u03a02 is related to the number of d.o.f.\nN that can be excited. We now see how RE is related\nto f(N) by relating \u03a01 to \u03a02. For incompressible fluid\nturbulence, our dynamical quantity \u03b5l is the time rate of\nenergy transfer per unit mass through length scale l. The\nprocedure is then as follows:\n1. conservation and steady state imply (ensemble av-\neraged) that \u03b5inj \u223c \u03b5l \u223c \u03b5diss; that is, the average\nenergy injection rate \u03b5inj balances the average en-\nergy dissipation rate \u03b5diss.\n2. the rate at which energy is transferred to the fluid\nis from dimensional analysis: \u03b5inj \u223c U3\/L0\n3. Dimensional analysis of Navier Stokes gives \u03b5diss \u223c\n\u03bd3\/\u03b74\n4. \u03b5inj \u223c \u03b5diss then relates \u03a01 to \u03a02:\nRE =\nUL0\n\u03bd\n\u223c\n(\nL0\n\u03b7\n)\u03b2\n(3)\nand fixes exponent \u03b2 = 4\/3\n5. the solution is of scaling type, so that:\nN \u223c\n(\nL0\n\u03b7\n)\u03b1\n(4)\nwith \u03b1 > 0 by definition\n6. thus\nRE \u223c\n(\nL0\n\u03b7\n)\u03b2\n\u223c N\u03b2N (5)\nand \u03b2N = \u03b2\u03b1 > 0\nThe value of the exponents \u03b1 and \u03b2 will depend on the de-\ntailed phenomenology of the turbulent flow. An estimate\nbased on K41 for example, with \u03b2 = 4\/3 from the above,\nand \u03b1 = D = 3 where D is Euclidean dimension[3], im-\nplies a high degree of disorganization and will be mod-\nified for example if the turbulence is intermittent. Im-\nportantly, the only property of turbulence with which we\nare concerned here is that both \u03b2 > 0 and \u03b1 > 0 so that\n\u03b2N = \u03b2\/\u03b1 > 0. This identifies the Reynolds number as\nthe control parameter for a process (turbulence) which\nsimply excites more active modes or d.o.f. as we increase\nRE .\nWe now see how above arguments apply to other sys-\ntems as defined above, in particular to avalanche models.\nWithout recourse to details of the system, similarity anal-\nysis will be sufficient to obtain the relationship between\nthe control parameter R and the number of degrees of\nfreedom N of the form:\nR \u223c N\u03b2N (6)\nThe value of the exponent \u03b2N will depend on the details\nof these systems but crucially we will see that the sign of\n\u03b2N is fixed by the similarity analysis. This is sufficient\nto establish whether or not, as in the case of turbulence,\nincreasing R increases the the number of excited d.o.f. in\nthe system.\nIII. CONTROL PARAMETER FOR\nAVALANCHING SYSTEMS\nWe now envisage a generic avalanche model in a sys-\ntem of size L0 where the height of sand is specified on\na grid, with nodes at spacing \u03b4l. Sand is added to in-\ndividual nodes, that is, on length scale \u03b4l at an average\ntime rate \u03b5inj = h per node. There is some process, here\navalanches, which then transports this dynamical quan-\ntity (the sand) though structures on intermediate length\n4TABLE II: \u03a0 theorem applied to an avalanching system. The\nsand carries a property with dimension S.\nVariable dimension description\nL0 L system size\n\u03b4l L grid size\n\u00b2 ST\u22121 system average dissipation\/loss rate\nh ST\u22121 average driving rate per node\nscales \u03b4l < l < L0. Sand is then lost to the system (dis-\nsipated) at a time rate \u00b2 over the system size L0. On\nintermediate length scales \u03b4l < l < L0, sand is conser-\nvatively transported via avalanches (see also [68\u201370]). In\nour discussion here we follow [5] and assume that the\ntransport timescale is fast, so that avalanches occur in-\nstantaneously and do not overlap. There must be some\ndetail of the internal evolution of the pile that maximizes\nthe number of length scales l on which avalanches can oc-\ncur. For avalanche models this is the property that trans-\nport can only occur locally if some local critical gradient\nis exceeded; as a consequence the pile evolves through\nmany metastable states. If these length scales represent\nexcited d.o.f. then the number N of d.o.f. available will\nbe bounded by L0 and \u03b4l so that N \u223c (L0\/\u03b4l)\u03b1, with\nD \u2265 \u03b1 \u2265 0 for D > 1 (\u03b1 may be fractional).\nThe four relevant variables for the avalanching system\nare given in Table 2. The two dimensionless groups are:\n\u03a01 =\nh\n\u00b2\n= RA, \u03a02 =\nL0\n\u03b4l\n= f(N) (7)\nWe will now relate the control parameter \u03a01 = h\/\u00b2\nto the number of excited d.o.f. by following the same\nprocedure as above. \u03b5l now refers to the time rate of\ntransfer of \u2019sand\u2019 through length scale l.\n1. conservation and steady state imply (ensemble av-\neraged) \u03b5inj \u223c \u03b5l \u223c \u03b5diss\n2. In Euclidean dimension D there are (L0\/\u03b4l)D\nnodes; D > 0 by definition. The rate at which\n\u2019sand\u2019 is transferred to the pile is then from dimen-\nsional analysis: \u03b5inj \u223c h(L0\/\u03b4l)D\n3. the system average dissipation rate is defined as\n\u00b2 = \u03b5diss\n4. \u03b5inj \u223c \u03b5diss then gives h(L0\/\u03b4l)D \u223c \u00b2 or:\nRA =\nh\n\u00b2\n\u223c\n(\n\u03b4l\nL0\n)D\n(8)\nthus in the above notation fixes \u03b2 = \u2212D < 0\n5. the number N of d.o.f. available will be bounded\nby L0 and \u03b4l so that:\nN \u223c\n(\nL0\n\u03b4l\n)\u03b1\n(9)\nwith D \u2265 \u03b1 \u2265 0 for D > 1 (the value of \u03b1 depends\non the details and may be fractional).\n6. thus\nRA =\nh\n\u00b2\n\u223c\n(\n\u03b4l\nL0\n)D\n\u223c N\u2212\u03b1D \u223c N\u03b2N (10)\nand \u03b2N = \u03b2\u03b1 = \u2212D\u03b1 < 0\nWe then have that the number of excited d.o.f. decreases\nas we increase the control parameter RA = h\/\u00b2. Thus\nwe recover the SDIDT limit for SOC, namely RA \u2192 0,\nbut now explicitly identify this limit with maximizing\nthe number of excited d.o.f.. Our result from dimen-\nsional analysis is to obtain RA \u223c N\u03b2N and to show quite\ngenerally that for the avalanching system \u03b2N < 0.\nOur dimensional analysis for the avalanche model maps\nonto that for K41 turbulence, so in that sense RA \u2261 RE ,\nthat is, RA is the avalanching system\u2019s \u2019effective Reynolds\nnumber\u2019, which expresses the ratio of driving to dissi-\npation. Both RE and RA increase with driving of the\nsystem, but the system\u2019s response is quite different. In\nthe case of K41 turbulence, the system can excite more\nmodes or degrees of freedom and the flow becomes more\ndisorganized, whereas in the avalanche models, less d.o.f.\nare available so the system is pushed toward order. The\nessential difference between the two systems in this con-\ntext is as follows. As we increase the driving in K41\nturbulence, the smallest lengthscale \u03b7 can decrease (via\nNavier Stokes) to provide the necessary dissipation to\nmaintain a steady state, and since we have assumed scal-\ning the system simply excites more modes or d.o.f.. On\nthe other hand, in the avalanche models both the smallest\nand largest lengthscales are fixed; increasing the driving\nwill ultimately introduce sand at a rate that exceeds the\nrate at which sand can be transported by the smallest\navalanches, as we discuss next.\nIV. SOC- LIKE BEHAVIOUR UNDER\nINTERMEDIATE DRIVE\nFor avalanching to be the dominant mode of trans-\nport of sand, there are conditions on the microscopic de-\ntails of the system; specifically, there must be a separa-\ntion of timescales such that the relaxation time for the\navalanches must be short compared to the time taken\nfor the driving to accumulate sufficient sand locally to\ntrigger an avalanche. Avalanches are triggered when a\ncritical value for the local gradient is exceeded, the criti-\ncal gradient can be a random variable but provided it has\na defined average value g, we have that on average, we\nwould need to add g\u03b4l sand to a single cell of an initially\nflat pile to trigger redistribution of sand. The number of\ntimesteps that this would take to occur would on aver-\nage be (g\u03b4l)\/(h\u03b4t) where again \u03b4l is the cell size and \u03b4t is\nthe timestep. This gives the condition for avalanching to\ndominate transport on all lengthscales in the grid [\u03b4l, L0],\nso that avalanches only occur after many grains of sand\nhave been added to any given cell in the pile and is the\n5strict SDIDT[60, 61] limit:\nh\u03b4t\u00bf g\u03b4l (11)\nWe will now consider an intermediate behaviour (see also\n[64])\ng\u03b4l < h\u03b4t\u00bf g\u03b4l\n(\nL0\n\u03b4l\n)D\n(12)\nwhere the driver is large enough to swamp of order\nh\u03b4t\/(g\u03b4l) cells of the pile at each timestep (each addition\nof sand), but this is still much smaller than the largest\navalanches that the system is able to support since the\nlargest possible avalanche in a system of Euclidean di-\nmension D is (L0\/\u03b4l)\nD cells.\nFor a given physical realization of the sandpile, that\nis, fixed box size L0 and grid size \u03b4l, successively in-\ncreasing h\u03b4t above g\u03b4l then successively increases the\nsmallest avalanche size (to some \u03b4l\u2032 > \u03b4l). Ultimately\nas h and hence RA is increased to the point where\nh\u03b4t \u223c g\u03b4l (L0\/\u03b4l)D there will be a crossover to laminar\nflow, as each addition of sand drives avalanches that are\non the size of the system.\nWe now assume that the avalanching process is self-\nsimilar, so that the system is large enough that the prob-\nability density of avalanche sizes S is P (S) \u223c S\u2212\u03b3 over a\nlarge range of S; that is, finite sized effects do not domi-\nnate. Consequently this intermediate, finite RA behavior\nwill be \u2018SOC like\u2019, with avalanches occurring within the\nrange of lengthscales [\u03b4l\u2032, L0] with power law statistics\nsharing the same exponent \u03b3 as at the SDIDT limit.\nWe will illustrate these remarks with simulations of the\nBak, Tang and Wiesenfeld (BTW) (see [5]) sandpile in\n2D, where the driving occurs randomly in time and is\nspatially restricted to the \u2018top\u2019 of the pile. In all cases\nshown, the critical gradient (threshold for avalanching)\nis g = 4\u03b4l\u22121, and normalized distributions of the number\nof topplings in an avalanche S are shown (we take top-\nplings as a measure of avalanche size following [5]). In\nFigure 1 we plot the results from two simulations in a\nbox of size L0\/\u03b4l = 100, under driving rates h = 4\u03b4t\u22121\nand h\u2032 = 16\u03b4t\u22121. We can see that as we increase the\ndriving rate from h = 4\u03b4t\u22121 to h\u2032 = 16\u03b4t\u22121 , the occur-\nrence probability of the smallest avalanches is reduced,\nand on these normalized histograms, the probability of\nlarger events is increased. These larger events for the run\nwith h\u2032 = 16\u03b4t\u22121, that is, for S \u223c [102 \u2212 103.5], still fol-\nlow the same power law scaling as the h = 4\u03b4t\u22121 run (the\nprecise location on the plot of the crossover in behaviour\nwill depend on details of the dynamics of the pile). This\nis to be anticipated provided that transport on these in-\ntermediate scales is still dominated by avalanching, that\nis, intermediate scale avalanches still have the property\nthat they relax on a timescale that is much faster than\nthat required by the driving to initiate an avalanche. If\nthis is the case, then the phenomenology of these inter-\nmediate scale avalanches is unchanged by the increase in\nthe driving rate and as a consequence, except close to\nthe crossover in statistics, their scaling exponent is, as\nwe see, unchanged. As the system has self similar spatial\nscaling we can also anticipate obtaining the same solu-\ntion for these avalanches subject to a rescaling; S, which\nis a measure of avalanche size, will simply scale with h\u03b4t,\nthe sand which must be redistributed at each timestep\nsince h\u03b4t > g\u03b4l. This is shown in the lower plot of Figure\n1 where we have rescaled the h\u2032 = 16\u03b4t\u22121 intermediate\nrange driving results by S \u2192 S\/16. We can see that\npower law regions of the plots that both correspond to\navalanching now coincide.\nWe can go further and anticipate that two realizations\nof the system, one with h and L0 and the other with h\u2032 =\nAh and L\u20320 = AL0 give the same solution for P (S) under\nrescaling S \u2192 S\u2032\/AD. This is shown in Figure 2 where\nwe compare two runs of the sandpile (i) with h = 4\u03b4t\u22121\nand L0 = 100\u03b4l and (ii) with h\u2032 = 16 and L\u20320 = 400\u03b4l,\nin the same format as Figure 1. We can indeed see a\nclose correspondence of the avalanche statistics in the\npower law region of the plot once we have rescaled the\nh\u2032 = 16\u03b4t\u22121 and L\u20320 = 400\u03b4l run by S \u2192 S\/16 (at the\nlargest S, the histograms do not precisely collapse under\nthis self affine scaling, see [40] for a discussion of the finite\nsize type of scaling properties of the model).\nThis establishes a general property of avalanching sys-\ntems that has been seen in several representative SOC\nmodels, such as in [64\u201366]. Depending on the details,\nspecifically, provided that a separation of timescales for\navalanching can be maintained, some SOC systems will\nshow scaling in systems where the drive is in fact highly\nvariable. One could argue that such robustness against\nfluctuations in the driving is necessary for SOC to pro-\nvide a \u2018working model\u2019 in real physical systems where the\nidealized SDIDT limit may not be realized.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have used similarity and dimensional analysis to\ndiscuss high dimensional, driven, dissipating, out of equi-\nlibrium systems, in particular avalanching systems that\nexhibit bursty transport that can be in an SOC state.\nThese act to transport a dynamical quantity (e.g. for\nthe avalanche models, sand) from the driving to the dis-\nsipation scale, in a manner that is conservative, that is\nsteady state on the average, and that shows scaling. The\ngeneric nature of this method of analysis implies that\nour results are not restricted to sandpile models per se,\nand have wider application to physical systems that show\nbursty transport, and scaling. We have postulated that a\n\u2019class\u2019 of these systems have a single control parameter R\nwhich expresses the ratio of the driving to the dissipation\nand which can be related to the number of excited de-\ngrees of freedom N . Dimensional analysis then leads to a\nrelationship of the form R \u223c N\u03b2N and without reference\nto any detailed phenomenology of the system, determines\nthe sign of \u03b2N .\nWe have focussed on avalanche models that can exhibit\n6100 101 102 103 104\n10\u22128\n10\u22126\n10\u22124\n10\u22122\n100\nS\nP(\nS)\n100 101 102 103 104\n10\u22128\n10\u22126\n10\u22124\n10\u22122\n100\nS\nP(\nS)\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Avalanche size normalized distribu-\ntions for two runs of the 2D BTW[5, 40] sandpile driven at\nthe top corner formed by two adjacent closed boundaries, the\nother boundaries are open.

The limit RA \u2192 0 is just the well known\nSDIDT limit of SOC. Specific avalanching systems will\nhave different values of \u03b2N but will all share the essen-\ntial property that we obtain here, that \u03b2N < 0 so that\nthat N is maximal under the limit of vanishing driv-\ning. Our formalism for SOC has close correspondence\nwith that for Kolmogorov homogeneous isotropic turbu-\nlence. A minimalist interpretation of our results is that\nKolmogorov turbulence maximizes the number of excited\nd.o.f. N under maximal (infinite) driving in contrast to\nSOC. A maximalist interpretation is thatRA is analogous\nto the Reynolds number RE . This establishes an essen-\ntial distinction between turbulence and SOC. Practically\nspeaking, it can for example arise because if we fix the\nouter, driving scale in Kolmogorov turbulence, the dissi-\npation scale can simply adjust as we increase the driving.\nSince the system shows scaling, this acts to increase the\navailable degrees of freedom. Avalanching on the other\nhand, is realized in a finite sized domain (box) and driven\non a fixed, smallest scale, so increasing the driving be-\nyond a certain point simply swamps the smallest spatial\nscales, thus reducing the available degrees of freedom.

This has been seen previously for spe-\ncific realizations of avalanche models [64] but is shown\nhere to be quite generic; and is a necessary property for\nSOC to be a candidate for physical (RA finite) systems.\nAs the driving is increased, the excited number of de-\ngrees of freedom (modes) decreases for SOC and increases\nfor turbulence, so that in principle one could distinguish\nSOC from turbulence observationally by testing how the\nbandwidth (range of spatio- temporal scales) over which\nscaling is observed, varies with the driving rate.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank M.
