Light entering the sphere is\nscattered by the internal walls with very high levels of total diffuse reflectance. For an ideal diffuse\nscatterer or Lambertian surface, the radiance L (in W m-2 sr-1) from a given point is a constant in any\ndirection. For a cavity with spherical geometry, it follows that the irradiance E (in W m-2) received from\nthat point is then constant over the entire sphere[1,2]. Therefore, after only a few passes across the cell to\nremove the local effects of launch geometry, the irradiance is perfectly uniform over the surface. This\nmakes integrating spheres ideal for use in measurement of parameters such as the total emission from light\nsources.\nFor the measurement of absorption, advantages include a tolerance to misalignment and the ability to\nmeasure irregular or turbid samples without the scattered light affecting the measurement. In 1970,\nElterman[2] demonstrated measurements of glass samples at 546nm within a simple 3.2 cm diameter\nintegrating sphere. Fry, Kattawar and Pope[3] have measured visible absorption in aqueous solutions, Fecht\nand Johnson[4] have adapted the principle for use with falling aqueous sample streams, and Hodgkinson et\nal. have adapted a photothermal cell using an integrating cavity[5].\nTo our knowledge, the use of an integrating sphere for gas absorption measurements was first reported in\n1980 by Venkatesh et al.[6] for carbon monoxide monitoring around 5 \u00b5m. In 1988 Abdullin and Lebedev[7]\nused a copper sphere with a CO2 laser to measure ammonia concentrations and in 1996 Tranchart et al.[8]\nused a 10 cm diameter sphere in combination with tunable diode laser spectroscopy at 830nm and 1.2\u03bcm to\ndetect water vapor and butane respectively. These studies confirmed an important advantage of using\nintegrating spheres. Compared with standard multipass optical cells such as those developed by White[9],\n3Herriott et al.[10] or Chernin et al.[11], integrating spheres offer increased path lengths within a relatively\nsmall volume without the need for precise alignment of the laser beam.\nMore recent work at the University of Limerick has resulted in broadband spectroscopic sensors for CO2 (at\n1.57\u03bcm and 2\u03bcm)[12] and NO2 and SO2 (in the UV\/visible)[13]. Finally, a commercial non-dispersive infra-\nred (NDIR) gas sensor designed by City Technology Ltd. takes the form of an integrating cavity, using\ndeliberately roughened, gold coated internal surfaces[14].\nAt low concentrations, the level of light absorption measured in such systems is proportional to the\nconcentration of the analyte. However, many practical systems are required to operate over a large dynamic\nrange that might extend into a region of nonlinearity for absorption measurements. In particular, the lower\nexplosive limit (LEL) for methane is 4.9 vol. %[15], defining a concentration range in % LEL where\n100% LEL corresponds to 4.9 vol. % It can be important for methane detectors in safety critical\napplications to be able to cover the entire range from low ppm levels up to and through the %LEL range,\nwith particular attention paid to measurements at 20 %LEL (approx 1 vol. % methane) [15].\nFor a gas cell with a single path length, the Beer-Lambert Law (see Section 2) governs nonlinearity in the\nmeasured light intensity as a function of analyte concentration. However, for a cell such as an integrating\nsphere where the light makes multiple randomized passes with different path lengths, the nonlinearity is\nexacerbated and dependent on the path-length distribution within the cavity. Previous work in this area has\nso far been concerned with calculating the average path length of photons in the cavity[16,17], or calculating\nthe decay time of a pulse of photons[17] using a Monte Carlo simulation, the latter also providing more\ngeneral information about the distances travelled by photons in the cavity.\nWe have taken this work a stage further by modeling the path-length distribution within an integrating\n4sphere and predicting the resulting system nonlinearity. We have compared this prediction with a simple\nexperimental absorption measurement based on tunable diode laser spectroscopy of a single methane line at\n1651 nm. This provides an experimental test not only for our predicted absorption response, but also for\nprevious work on temporal responses.\n2 Theory\nFigure 1 shows a simplified model of the integrating sphere used in our experiments. For monochromatic\nradiation, the radiant flux (in watts) transmitted through a gas cell, \u03a6, is given by the Beer-Lambert law[18]:\n\uf028 \uf029zexp \uf061\uf02d\uf046\uf03d\uf046 0 (1)\nWhere \u03a60 is the radiant flux transmitted in the absence of light absorption, z is the path length (here in\ncentimeters) and \u03b1 is the absorption coefficient of the sample, equal to the concentration of the analyte\n(here expressed in units of partial pressure, atmospheres, equivalent to volume % readings at atmospheric\npressure), multiplied by the specific absorptivity of the gas \u03b5 (here in units atm-1 cm-1). Methane has a well-\nknown absorption line at a wavelength of 1651 nm. At atmospheric pressure the value of \u03b5 at the line center\nis 0.38 cm-1atm-1, according to information in the HITRAN database[19].\n5Figure 1. Simplified model of an integrating sphere, showing the incident beam making a first pass across\nthe cell to the first strike spot. Two examples are shown of light beams making subsequent random multiple\npasses across the cell.\nAt low values of \u03b1z, Eq. (1) approximates to the following linear relationship.\nz\uf061\uf0bb\n\uf046\n\uf044\uf046\n0\n(2)\nWhere \u0394\u03a6 is the change in transmitted radiant flux, \u03a60-\u03a6. Tranchart et al.[8] have shown that for an\nintegrating sphere of internal radius R and high values of mean surface reflectivity \u03c1, the received signal for\nlow \u03b1z is approximated by;\n\uf028 \uf029\uf072\n\uf061\n\uf02d\n\uf0bb\n\uf046\n\uf044\uf046\n1\n0\n0\nz\n(3)\nwhere the mean path length for a single pass is z0= 3\n4 R. They then derive the effective total path length for\nlow or zero absorbance \u03b1 within the sphere, Zeff;\n\uf028 \uf029\u03c1\nRZ eff\n\uf02d\n\uf0bb\n13\n4 (4)\nIn the next section we derive equations that describe the performance of the sphere over the full range of\ngas concentrations to give a more complete description of sphere performance.\nfirst strike\nspot\nphotodetector\nincident\nbeam\nentrance\naperture\nsidewalls with\naverage\nreflectivity \u03c1\nR\n6A Simple model for path-length distribution\nFor gas cells involving a range of different path lengths, it is necessary to consider the contribution that\neach individual path length makes separately, before integrating over all path lengths. We define the\nprobability density function (PDF) \u03a8(z) of path lengths to give the proportion of path lengths that lie within\nthe interval z to z+dz, in the absence of gas, such that\n\uf028 \uf029\uf0f2\n\uf0a5\n\uf03d\uf059\n0\n1dzz (5)\nNote that for this model, we have normalized \u03a8(z) to the total level of light received at the detector in the\nabsence of gas, rather than the total incident into the sphere. We apply the Beer-Lambert Law (Eq. (1)) to\neach path length in the interval from z to z+dz, such that the radiant flux at the detector at a given\nwavelength is then;\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf0f2\n\uf0a5\n\uf02d\uf059\uf046\uf03d\uf046\n00\ndzzexpz \uf061 (6)\nA simple expression can be derived for integrating spheres with high internal reflectivities, in which the\npath-length distribution for a single pass across the cell is neglected and each pass is considered to have\nlength equal to the mean path length of z0 = 3\n4 R. For such a cell, Fry et al.[17] have derived the temporal\nresponse of the irradiance incident on the walls, E (in W m-2), following an impulse. The irradiance as a\nfunction of time, E(t), is given by;\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf072\n\uf074\n\uf074 ln\nandexp0\nttEtE \uf02d\uf03d\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf03d (7)\nWhere t is the mean transit time for photons across the cavity. We can transform from time to distance as\na variable for the impulse, using z=ct where c is the speed of light in the cavity; we also have tcz \uf03d0 . The\nirradiance resulting from photons with a transit distance z, E(z), is therefore\n7\uf028 \uf029\n\uf072\n\uf064\n\uf064 ln\nandexp 00\nzzEzE\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf03d . (8)\nFor a fixed detector and continuous wave (CW) input, this also, therefore, gives the z dependency for the\nfractional radiant flux; for simplicity we separate out this z dependency as a normalized probability density\nfunction for optical path lengths, such that;\n\uf028 \uf029\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\uf059\uf03d\uf059 \uf072lnexp\n0\n0 z\nzz (9)\nwhere \u03a80 is a normalization constant.

(11)\nFor low \u03b1z0 and high \u03c1, this approximates to Eq. (3) in this paper, taken from Tranchart et al.[8].\nIt was necessary to account for specific launch and de-launch conditions as follows. Our first pass across\nthe sphere took the form of a collimated beam from the entry point to the first strike spot, with a path length\nof 2R. In our experimental integrating sphere, any final pass would involve a detector with a field of view\nrestricted to \u00b130\u00b0. Figure 2 and Table 1 summarize consecutive passes across the cell, indicating how each\npass was modeled. Eq. (10) fails to take account of the first and last pass across the cell; to do so, we\nmultiplied by the transmission expected from the Beer-Lambert law for the additional launch \/ delaunch\npath, z\u2113, estimated in Table 1 to be 2.52 R. We also add an additional offset path length of z0\/2 to account\nfor averaging effects over the first few passes (see later in Figure 9(b) for a graphical explanation). The\noffset ensures that both our analytical and our full numerical models converge to the same mean path length\nafter approximately 3-4 passes across the cell, giving the following combined equation:\n80\n0\n0 ln\nln\n2\nexp\nz\nz\nz\nI\nI\n\uf061\uf072\n\uf072\n\uf061\n\uf02d\uf0f7\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d \uf06c (12)\nFigure 2.

Using Eq. (13), the mean path length for any final pass to\nthe detector evaluates to 1.85 R; an additional 0.52 R.\nB Full model for path-length distribution\nA full model requires calculation of the path-length distribution for a single pass across the cell from a\nLambertian scatterer. The geometry of this pass is illustrated in Figure 3 and has been considered by\nTranchart et al. [8]; for clarity we have continued to use their formalism.\n10\n\uf071\n\uf071\nR\nd\uf071\ndS2\ndS1\nz\nFigure 3.

Because light scattering is\ncompletely randomized, each pass is independent of the next. From one pass to the next, the total irradiance\nis reduced in proportion to \u03c1. Importantly, for a Lambertian scatterer the diffuse reflectivity is not a\nfunction of incident angle, therefore within a sphere all light paths in one pass are equally likely to create\nlight paths of the same distribution in a subsequent pass.\nAfter the first pass, the path-length distribution is equal to \u03c8(z). A proportion of light paths (1-\u03c1) do not\nsurvive to the second pass, whereas a proportion of paths \u03c1 go on to make a second pass. After the second\npass, each surviving path in the interval z+dz is added cumulatively to further path lengths in proportion to\nthe path-length distribution \u03c8(z), to give a distribution \u03a8(z). And so on.\nThis reasoning does not lend itself to an analytical solution, however it has been possible to build a\nnumerical model to give a full path-length distribution (in the absence of gas) for multiple passes. We have\nconsidered the full model alongside the simpler model of Eq. (10), in which the path-length distribution for\na single pass is taken to be equal to a constant value equal to 3\n4 R. Comparing these models therefore allows\n12\nus to evaluate whether the single-pass distribution makes a significant contribution, or whether each pass\nacross the sphere can be adequately modeled using the mean path length of 3\n4 R.\n3 Numerical modeling of path lengths\nOur numerical model is illustrated in Figure 4. We established a discrete series of N path-length intervals\nper sphere radius, with N=100 giving a resolution equal to R\/100. As a total of 500 passes were modeled,\nthe maximum theoretical path length that could be achieved was 1000 R, split into 100\uf0b4500=50,000\ndiscrete intervals. For the first pass, the values of path lengths zj and the corresponding probability density\nfunction (PDF) \u03c8j were given by Eq. (17). Let these be assigned to an overall cumulative distribution of\npath lengths Zi with probabilities given by \u03a8i.\nFor the second pass, each of the Zi paths from the first pass could add to any of the paths zj from the second\npass. The corresponding probability is given by \u03a8i.\u03c8j.\u03c1. This procedure yielded two matrices corresponding\nto all possible summed path lengths and their corresponding probabilities. A re-binning exercise created\nnew cumulative vectors Zi (by sorting and summing the path-length matrix) and \u03a8i (by following the\nmapping for the path lengths Zi and summing probabilities).\n13\nFigure 4. Illustration of numerical modeling procedure for path-length distribution, (a) determining the\nvalues of path lengths in discrete intervals, and (b) determining the corresponding PDF.\nThere was the potential to introduce a rounding error during the re-binning exercise because of the finite\nresolution of the bin size. For each modeled pass a single rounding error for one bin would be equal to half\nthe width of one interval, or R\/N. If randomly distributed, over 500 passes these could combine to a total\nerror for the final cumulative path length Zi in each bin of N\/R500 = 0.2 R.\nNote that so far, this model has accounted only for those photons that survived 500 successive passes across\nthe cell. We accounted for those that were absorbed at the sphere surface as follows. For each iteration of a\npass across the sphere, a proportion \u03c1 of all the light survived to the next pass and a proportion (1-\u03c1) was\nabsorbed. A second cumulative matrix was constructed, corresponding to the photons that did not survive.\nOver the course of 500 iterations, the majority of the modeled light accumulated within this second matrix;\nindeed, has it not done so, it would have been necessary to extend the number of iterations to ensure that\nthe model converged to a solution. Had we not considered the photons that did not survive, the model\nwould have predicted the unphysical case of a vanishingly small amount of light that persisted in a cell with\nnew pathlength Z\u2019i,j = Zi + zj\nzj for a\nsingle\npass\ncumulative Zi for previous passes\nsort and re-bin\nnew cumulative Zi\nnew pdf \u03a8\u2019i,j  =  \u03a8i\u00b7\u03c8j\u00b7\u03c1 \n\u03c8j for a\nsingle\npass\ncumulative \u03a8i for previous passes\nre-bin, following Zi mapping\nnew cumulative \u03a8i\n(a) Modelling procedure for pathlengths (b) Modelling procedure for PDF\n14\na path length approaching infinity.\nWe normalized to the total level of light that reached the detector, rather than the total incident at the sphere\nentry port, therefore requiring that \uf0e5 \uf03d\uf059 1i . Because the role of the detector as an absorber was already\naccounted for in the value of the absorbed fraction of light, (1-\u03c1), we did not specifically account for its\nsize. Finally we accounted for launch \/ delaunch geometry by adding an additional distance of z\u2113 = 2.52 R\nto all the modeled paths, following Figure 4 and Table 1.\nOur results took the form of a vector of discrete path-length intervals Zi, alongside a corresponding vector\ncontaining the fraction of light \u03a8i that was modeled to lie within the interval Zi+\u03b4z. To predict the fraction\nof light that would then be received by a detector in the presence of a gaseous absorber filling the sphere,\nEq. (6) was evaluated using the discrete values of Zi and \u03a8i.\n4 Experimental details\nTo test our models, we chose to use a simple form of direct spectroscopy, in which the emission from a\ntunable diode laser was scanned across a methane line. This had the advantage of simplicity of operation\nand made a direct measurement of the depth of an absorption line whose peak absorption is well-known.\nOur experimental arrangement is shown schematically in Figure 5.\n15\nFigure 5. Experimental configuration used for direct line scanning or wavelength modulation spectroscopy\nof methane absorption in an integrating sphere.\nOur DFB laser package (Semelab Ltd) incorporated a 1651 nm laser diode (NEL NLK1U5C1CA-TS). The\nemitted wavelength was scanned across the gas absorption line center by applying a current ramp through a\ndriver (ILX Lightwave, LDC-3722B), the current varying between a minimum of 30mA and a maximum of\n80mA (corresponding to a frequency range of 33 GHz). Gross wavelength tuning was achieved by\ncontrolling the diode temperature using a Peltier element within the package. The wavelength of the\nemission was checked, relative to the methane absorption line, using a gas reference cell consisting of a Ge\ndetector in a TO can filled with 100% methane (Semelab Ltd) to give a reference path length of\napproximately 5.3mm.\nA detector \/ amplifier (Thorlabs PDA400) was used with a gain of 0dB (15 kV\/A). The output was sampled\nusing a data acquisition card and transferred to a PC for data processing. In the absence of gas, a reference\nmeasurement showed a rising output intensity with current, as expected. In the presence of methane, at the\nabsorption line centre a depression was observed corresponding to the scale of the absorption (Figure 6(a)).\npackaged DFB laser diode\nlaser\ncontroller\nsawtooth\ngenerator\namplifier\ngas inlet\n(outlet at 90\u00b0\nto page)\nfirst strike\nspot\nrecessed\ndetector\nwedged\n& angled\nwindow\n16\nThe peak absorption was measured by subtracting the received signal from the reference and normalizing to\nthe reference intensity (Figure 6(b)).\nAn integrating sphere was chosen with a diameter of 50.8 mm (Thorlabs IS200). Light from the laser diode\nentered the integrating sphere via a 6.35 mm diameter entry port. The detector (12.5 mm diameter port) was\nrecessed to prevent a direct line of sight light from the first strike spot; therefore, no baffle was necessary.\nThe detector\u2019s field of view was restricted to \u00b132\u00b0. Two additional ports (1.5 mm diameter) were modified\nso as to permit entry and exit of test gas concentrations.\nTest gases were fed to the sphere from two certified cylinders (Scott Specialty Gases), one containing\nhydrocarbon (HC) free air and the other containing 2.5 vol.% methane in air. Two calibrated mass flow\ncontrollers (Teledyne Hastings HFC-302, 0-1000 cm3\/min, with THPS-400 controller) were used to control\nflow rates from the two cylinders, with downstream mixing generating a series of mixtures of different\nconcentrations in the range 0-2.5 vol.%, corresponding to an absorption range of \u03b1 = 0-0.01cm-1. The error\nin the applied concentration was dominated by the analytical error in the gas cylinder concentration (\u00b11%\nof the nominal value), except at low flow rates through the mass flow controllers, where an additional error\nof 0.5% of the full scale reading applied in the worst case.\n5 Results\nFigure 6 (a) shows an example of raw data collected directly from the detector, for HC free air and for a\nmid range methane concentration of 5770ppm. Figure 6 (b) shows the results following processing to\nsubtract the zero baseline from the signal and normalize for the total received light. The drop in\ntransmission at the absorption line centre is apparent in the figure, and this was used as our measurement.\nThe experimental error in the transmission for each measurement was estimated to be \u00b10.3%. Using a\n17\nsingle measurement of direct absorption had the disadvantage of a relatively high level of experimental\nnoise at low concentrations; however, this method offered accurate measurement of the transmission,\nwithout systematic errors.\nFigure 6. Examples of detected signals recorded while the laser wavelength was scanned across a single\nmethane line at 1651nm. (a) Raw data from the detector for HC free air and for a methane concentration of\n5770 ppm. (b) Methane transmission normalized by division by the background signal.\nA Calibrating the model\nEq. (4) confirms that the average reflectivity \u03c1 of the inner surface of an integrating sphere has a strong\ninfluence on the mean effective path length. Manufacturer\u2019s data provides an approximate value for \u03c1, but\nmeasurement difficulties prevent a more precise value being known for a given sphere. Furthermore, light\nsinks such as entry ports, ports for gas sampling and the presence of a detector reduce the effective\nreflectivity \u03c1 of the sphere as a whole. It was therefore necessary to calibrate the value of \u03c1 used in our\nmodel with some initial experimental results.\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n70 75 80 85 90\ncurrent \/ mA\nph\not\nod\net\nec\nto\nrs\nig\nna\nl\/\nm\nV\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n70 75 80 85 90\ncurrent \/ mA\nno\nrm\nal\nis\ned\ntra\nns\nm\nis\nsi\non\n\/%\n(a) Raw data (b) Background corrected signal\nbackground in\nHC free air\nmethane\nabsorption\n18\nWe calibrated the sphere at our lowest experimental concentrations of 0 ppm and 2270 ppm, with\ntransmission at the line center of 100% and 96.51\u00b10.14 %, respectively. Eq. (1) was used to fit these results\nto a mean path length of Zeff = 1.22\u00b10.04 m. To account for launch geometry with z\u2113 = 2.52 R, we used the\nvalue of Zeff - z\u2113 = 1.16\u00b10.04 m for calibration. Eq. (4) (which does not provide for these launch conditions)\nwas then used to find the average sphere reflectivity of \u03c1 = 97.11\u00b10.10%.\nB Testing the simple analytical model\nWe tested the model of Eq. (12), which assumes that for each pass across the cell, the path length takes a\nsingle value equal to z0 = 3\n4 R. The model was tested using our calibration value of \u03c1 = 97.11 % and launch\n\/ delaunch path length z\u2113 = 2.52 R. We were also able to fit these parameters to our data to optimise this\nmodel, resulting in optimal values of \u03c1 = 97.13% and launch \/ delaunch path length z\u2113 = 2.85 R. Figure 7\ncompares our experimental data with the modeled results, plus the prediction of the Beer Lambert law for a\nsingle path-length cell. The graph illustrates the scale of the deviation from a simple application of this law,\nand the need for a better model. The results imply that additional care needs to be taken for gas\nmeasurement schemes that use direct absorption scans with a fitted line shape, rather than with simple\nmeasurement of the transmission at the line centre. Such schemes would be vulnerable to apparent changes\nin the line shape caused by transmission nonlinearities.\n19\nFigure 7. Comparison between experimentally determined response and the results of Eq. (12) using\noptimized values of \u03c1 and z\u2113. Also shown for comparison is the response predicted by the Beer Lambert law\nfor a single path-length cell.\nFigure 8 shows the residual errors in the modeled response, compared to our experimental data. Our total\nexperimental error results from the combined effects of a 0.3% error in our transmission reading and the\nerror in the gas concentration. For the purpose of comparison, the latter has been transformed to an\nequivalent transmission error using Eq. (12) and combined with the former to yield a total effective error of\nbetween 0.4% and 0.5% on the transmission data.\nVisual inspection reveals that the agreement between the simplified model and our experimental data is\nwithin our estimated experimental error. The residual errors in Figure 8 show a consistent pattern as a\nfunction of concentration. This may be associated with an underlying error in our experimental data, which\nwould persist in comparisons with different models.

Examples of three probability density functions (PDFs) are plotted in\nFigure 9, showing the distribution of light in different path-length intervals. These PDFs shows the results\nof our full model that takes into account the distribution of path lengths for a single pass across the sphere.\nNote that the x-axis is logarithmic and the PDFs are normalized such that the integrated area under each\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\nInitial calibration:\n\u03c1 = 97.11 %\nz\u2113 = 2.52 R\nOptimised:\n\u03c1 = 97.13 %\nz\u2113 = 2.85 R\nconcentration \/ %vol\ner\nro\nri\nn\n\u0394\nI \n\/ \nI 0\n\/%\nexperimental\nerror\n-1.0\n-0.5\n0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n-1.5\n21\ncurve equals unity. As \u03c1 increases, there is a shift in the path-length distribution toward longer path lengths,\nas expected. At short path lengths, the effect of consecutive passes across the sphere can be distinguished\nas a series of undulations in the PDF, but with increasing passes across the sphere these merge into one\nanother until they can no longer be resolved. The PDF then converges to the exponentially decaying\nfunction predicted by Eq. (9).\nFigure 9. Optical path-length distribution for a 50.8 mm diameter sphere.

The response predicted\nby the Beer-Lambert law for a single path-length cell is also provided as a comparison.\nResidual errors were calculated as before. We found that errors were minimised for a value of \u03c1 of 97.15%,\nwhich is within the estimated error for our calibration value of 97.11%. Errors for three different values of\n\u03c1, including this optimum value, are plotted against concentration in Figure 11. Again, the results show a\nconsistent systematic pattern that implies that errors in our experimental results may be contributing\nsignificantly.

Agreement between each of\nthe two models and our experimental data is generally good. Our calibration values of \u03c1 = 97.11 \u00b1 0.1 %\nand z\u2113 = 2.52 R can be considered a good starting point; the experimental error on \u03c1 was relatively high\nbecause this value was based on a measurement at the lowest test concentration. For each model, optimum\nvalues of \u03c1 were found, with the new values of \u03c1 lying within 1\u03c3 of the calibration value. An optimum z\u2113\nwas also determined for Eq. (12). Both models agreed well with our experimental data, within our\nestimated experimental error, therefore we cannot distinguish between them.\naverage reflectivity \u03c1 \/ %\nm\nea\nn\npa\nth\nle\nng\nth\nZ e\nff\n\/m\naverage reflectivity \u03c1 \/ %\nrm\ns\n r\ne\ns\nid\nu\na\nl \ne\nrr\no\nr \nin\n \u0394\nI\/I\n0\n\/%\n(a) (b)\n96.6 96.8 97.0 97.2 97.4 97.6\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n96.6 96.8 97.0 97.2 97.4 97.6\n25\nTable 2.

The assumption used in this model - that each pass across the cell\nmay be modeled by using the mean path length for a single pass \u2013 appears to be a valid one. We suppose\nthat this applies for cells in which the surface has a sufficiently high reflectivity to enable multiple passes to\noccur, allowing the true path-length distribution to reach its asymptote corresponding to the simplified\nmodel (as shown in Figure 9(b)) with low error.\nAs the results are sensitive to changes in \u03c1, it is perhaps not surprising that, given noise in our data, we\nshould find slightly different optimal values of \u03c1 and z\u2113 for the two models. As can be seen from Figure 9,\nafter the first few passes the PDF of path lengths converges to an exponential function as approximated in\nthe simplified model.\n26\n6 Discussion\nWe can use Eq. (12) to predict the response of the sphere at higher concentrations than were used\nexperimentally. Figure 13 shows the response of the sphere extrapolated to a methane concentration of\n100 vol.%, compared with the equivalent response for a conventional cell whose single path length is equal\nto the value of Zeff (1.252 m) calculated for the optimized model (see Table 2).\nIt can be seen that the response of a single path-length cell quickly becomes saturated as the concentration\nincreases, whereas the integrating sphere\u2019s nonlinearity ensures that this saturation occurs at higher\nconcentrations. Whether or not a gas cell is useable at high concentrations depends on the degree to which\nsmall differences in absorption may be detected as \u0394I\/I0. If we assume, for the sake of argument, that a\nchange of 1 part in 103 may be just distinguished, measurements made using the single path cell are unable\nto distinguish between methane concentrations between 14 vol.% and 100 vol.%. For measurements made\nusing the integrating sphere, the same change in \u0394I\/I0 corresponds to a change in concentration from\n80 vol.% to 100 vol.%. Therefore, the dynamic range of the integrating sphere is improved by virtue of its\nadditional nonlinearity.\n27\nFigure 13. Extrapolated response of integrating sphere to methane concentrations in the range 0.1 to\n100%vol, compared to the response predicted by the Beer-Lambert law for the single path length given in\nTable 2 for the optimised model.\nWe can also use our path-length distribution to shows the decay in intensity as a function of time, by\nscaling from distance z to time in ct, where c is the speed of light in the medium occupying the sphere and t\nis the transit time of a photon. Our results for path-length distributions can therefore be directly related to\nthose of Fry et al.[17] for the temporal decay time of a short pulse in an empty integrating sphere. It is\ngenerally accepted that the temporal response shows an exponential decay of the form I = I0 exp(-t\/\u03c4) [1].\nHowever, experimental tests of this are rare. For an ideal intensity impulse, our mean modeled path length\nshould be equivalent to the exponential decay constant.\nFry et al. assumed in their model that the transit distance for a single pass across the sphere is equal to the\nmean path length; we continued to use this approach in the simplified model considered here. For their case\n(ii), they considered zero time to be at the time of light entry to the cell, with a first pass across the cell of\nExperimental results: absorption\nBeer-Lambert Law, Zeff = 1.252m\nconcentration \/ %vol\n\u0394\nI\/\nI 0\n\/%\nEquation (12), \u03c1 = 97.13%, z\u2113 = 2.85 R\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n0.1 1 10 100\n28\nlength equal to R3\n4 (ie modelling an ideally diverging source).

Because the mean reflectivity was higher than for our\nprevious work, we ran the numerical model for a greater number of iterations (1000) to enable the model to\nconverge (in other words, the modeled path lengths were longer in this case). The results in Table 3 are\nexpressed in the same terms used by Fry et al., the dimensionless quantity c\u03c4\/R (equivalent in our model to\nZeff\/R), and show good agreement between the models. Agreement between our simplified analytical model\nand theirs is guaranteed by Eq. (9), which derives from their work.\nTable 3.

For our\nsimple analytical model, following Eq. (12) and Table 1, we find that the use of our additional offset of z0\/2\nimproves agreement with the numerical models but does not fully account for the difference.\n29\nFry et al. did not provide an experimental test of their model, presumably because of the practical difficulty\nassociated with measuring pulse decay times with sub-nanosecond resolution. Our experimental results\ntherefore provide an indirect though possibly simpler test of both our model and theirs.\nIntegrating spheres of are great utility in measurement applications that require an even and well-\ncharacterized irradiance across the whole internal surface. To use such a sphere as a gas absorption cell, our\nrequirements are less stringent and may be listed as follows:\n(i) For high sensitivity, we require a long path length contained within a practical sampling volume.\n(ii) For tolerance to misalignment during manufacture and \/ or vibration in use, we require the irradiance\nbe even across the surface in a region local to the detector, but not more widely.\n(iii) For ease of calibration by manufacturers it is preferred to have repeatable path lengths, requiring\nboth repeatable surface reflectivities and repeatable cell geometries.\nFor an integrating cavity the ideal solution is a sphere, but this is not an absolute requirement. The fact that\nour model is not very sensitive to the path-length distribution for a single pass indicates that other cavity\ngeometries may give similar results if they maintain the same mean path length. Other geometries might be\neasier to manufacture repeatably and at low cost. This was also considered in the work of Fry et al. [17].\nInstrument users typically prefer outputs that are linear with the target measurand. At high analyte\nconcentrations, absorption measurements based on the use of the Beer-Lambert law will always have to\ncontend with some nonlinearity, which is compounded when path-length distributions are broad. However,\nas long as nonlinearities are predictable, manufacturers are able to linearise the output using algorithms or\nlook-up tables.\n30\n7 Conclusion\nWe have developed a model that describes the variation in transmission with analyte concentration for an\nintegrating sphere used as an absorption cell. This model has been tested by measuring the absorption of\ngaseous methane at 1651nm in the concentration range 0-2.5 vol.% (corresponding to an absorption range\nof 0-0.01cm-1). Within the model, the probability density function (PDF) of optical path lengths within the\nsphere is calculated, and the fractional light transmission determined using the Beer-Lambert Law for light\nwithin each path-length interval in the PDF. The total light transmission shows an additional nonlinearity\nbeyond what would normally be expected from the Beer-Lambert law for a gas cell with a single path\nlength, and this nonlinearity is shown to be in good agreement with our experimental data.\nBecause the full model is computationally intensive, we have also tested a simplified model, whereby each\npass across the integrating sphere is assigned a length equal to the average length pass across the cell ( R3\n4 ).\nThis yields a simple analytical relationship that can be easily fitted to experimental data by varying two\nparameters, the average sphere reflectivity \u03c1 and the launch path length z\u2113, in our case yielding good\nagreement with residual errors within our estimated experimental error. This simpler model is a\ndevelopment of previous work in the field, and our experimental data provides a validation for its use.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work has been supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK\nunder Grant GR\/T04601\/01.
