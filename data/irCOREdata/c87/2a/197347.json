The advance of leaf out to earlier times in the year could be limited or even reversed, 7 \nhowever, as temperate and boreal trees require a certain amount of chilling in winter for rapid leaf 8 \nout in spring. If this chilling requirement is not fulfilled, an increasing amount of warming is 9 \nrequired for leaf out.

The models predict that in northern middle and high latitudes the advance of green-up will be 17 \nlimited to a total of four to five days on average (but up to 15 days regionally) over the time period 18 \n2000-2060 as estimated using two contrasting climate simulations. This results from the 19 \nexponentially increasing warming requirements for leaf out when winter chilling falls below a 20 \nthreshold as shown by a comparison with models that consider only spring warming. The model 21 \nevaluation suggests an element of regional adaptation of the warming required for leaf out in large 22 \nbiomes. 23 \n  24 \n Page 3   \n \n \n \n1. Introduction 1 \nLeaf phenology is linked with the carbon, water and energy exchange between the land surface and 2 \nthe atmosphere on hourly to interannual time scales. One of the most important aspects of leaf 3 \nphenology is leaf emergence as it modifies the atmospheric boundary layer and thus introduces 4 \nfeedbacks with the local and regional climate (Fitzjarrald et al., 2001; Freedman et al., 2001; Taylor 5 \net al., 1997). Incorporation of leaf phenology from remote sensing (RS) data in general circulation 6 \nmodels (GCMs) has lead to an improved representation of carbon fluxes and of latent heat and 7 \nsensible heat fluxes (Lawrence and Slingo, 2004; Randall et al., 1996; Van den Hurk et al., 2003). 8 \nLand-surface parameterizations in GCMs, however, do not entail robust models for the prediction 9 \nof leaf phenology. 10 \n 11 \nThe atmospheric CO2 record (Keeling et al., 1996), observations in phenological gardens (Menzel, 12 \n2000) and NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) Normalized Difference 13 \nVegetation Index (NDVI) show  an earlier start and later end of the growing season in the northern 14 \nhemisphere as well as a larger annual amplitude in the 1990s compared to earlier decades (Myneni 15 \net al., 1997; Shabanov et al., 2002). While the earlier increase of the NDVI could at least partly 16 \nreflect earlier snow melt, the earlier start of the growing season found in ground observations of 17 \nphenology and the changes in the seasonal cycle of the atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]a) 18 \nimply a large scale earlier green up of vegetation (Keeling et al., 1996; Menzel and Fabian, 1999; 19 \nRanderson et al., 1999; Sparks et al., 1997).  20 \nThus the observed NDVI increase in spring can be interpreted as a plant physiological response to 21 \nincreasing temperatures in the northern latitudes in a consistent and compelling way, although some 22 \npart of the NDVI increase is likely caused by earlier snow melt and the resulting feedbacks to 23 \nregional climate (Dye and Tucker, 2003; Shabanov et al., 2002).  24 \n 25 \n Page 4   \n \n \n \nThe relationship between leaf budburst and temperature is, however, more intricate than a direct 1 \nresponse of growth to spring warming. Controlled experiments show that many temperate and 2 \nboreal tree species require a period of cool temperatures (below 10\no\nC) in winter for rapid budburst 3 \nin response to warming in spring (Chuine and Cour, 1999; Murray et al., 1989; Myneni et al., 4 \n1997). If the amount of chilling falls below a certain threshold more warming is required to initiate 5 \nbudburst. In these experiments the amount of chilling is measured in the number of days with an 6 \naverage temperature below some threshold (\u201cNumber of Chill Days\u201d, NCD) counted from a start 7 \ndate. The warm period is measured as a heat sum, typically the number of hours or days with an 8 \naverage temperature above another threshold since another start date and is referred to as \u201cGrowing 9 \nDegree Days\u201d (GDD) or \u201cthermal time\u201d. The experiments show that when for a single a certain 10 \nthreshold NCD, the \u201cchilling requirement\u201d, is exceeded, plants will leaf out with minimal GDD. 11 \nWhen, however, the chilling requirement cannot be fulfilled (e.g. due to warm winters) then the 12 \nGDD requirement for leaf out increases in an exponential fashion with decreasing chilling received 13 \n(Cannell and Smith, 1986; Chuine and Cour, 1999; Murray et al., 1989; Myneni et al., 1997). 14 \nThe observed earlier green-up in the northern hemisphere reflects warmer springs (any given GDD 15 \nis reached earlier) and a still satisfied chilling requirement; or at least the lost NCD are compensated 16 \nfor by a sufficiently large increase in GDD.  17 \nA significant drop in the NCD, however, could lead to delayed budburst due to the exponentially 18 \nincreasing GDD requirements with decreasing NCD (Cannell and Smith, 1986; Murray et al., 19 \n1989), or at least a significant slowing of the advancement of leaf appearance to earlier times. 20 \nThus, paradoxically, there is a distinct possibility that global warming and associated warmer 21 \nsprings, which are predicted to be most pronounced in the high northern latitudes, will lead to a 22 \ndelayed budburst and this could provide a negative feedback to earlier greening of vegetation in 23 \nspring. This effect is at present not incorporated in land-surface models and this leads to 24 \n Page 5   \n \n \n \nuncertainties in projections of climate change, associated greening of land-surface vegetation and 1 \nthe magnitude of the land-surface carbon sink. 2 \n 3 \nTo improve the representation of the timing of green-up in land surface models (coupled to GCMs), 4 \nwe translate the exponential relationships between chilling and heat accumulation established for 5 \nsingle species to relationships for whole biomes. Previous work (Botta et al., 2000; Kaduk and 6 \nHeimann, 1996) suggests that similar relationships hold for both.  7 \nFor some biomes, however, the analysis of RS data indicates that simpler models using only 8 \nchilling or warming give equally good or even better results (Botta et al., 2000; Picard et al., 2005). 9 \nWe show in this paper, that this might be a consequence of a sampling design that is either too 10 \nlimited in space, only fairly small regions are used, or in time, only one year of data is used. In our 11 \ncurrent analysis we exploit the information available in data sets that cover a time span of 12 years 12 \nand cross validate our models on data not used for their calibration. 13 \n 14 \nWe use various methods to determine the time of green-up from the FASIR NDVI data 1984-1995 15 \n(Los et al., 2000), e.g. (Kaduk and Heimann, 1996; Moulin et al., 1997; White et al., 1997) and then 16 \nexplore commonly used phenology model as well as derive new models that predict the time of the 17 \ngreen-up in temperate and boreal biomes from GDD and NCD. Moreover, since it is widely 18 \nassumed that tree phenology adapts to the local climate, i.e. that provenance plays a role in leaf 19 \ndynamics, we explore in particular the question of whether phenology models can be improved by 20 \ntaking local temperature averages into account. We show that it is crucial to use multiple years of 21 \ndata to obtain stable models and reliable estimates for the prediction error. Finally we apply our 22 \nmodels to estimate the sensitivity of green-up to chilling requirement for two projected warming 23 \nscenarios in the middle of the 21st century. 24 \n Page 6   \n \n \n \nOur aims are to: a) estimate the effect of chilling requirements on earlier green up at the biome 1 \nlevel; b) derive climate driven phenology models that determine green-up for northern temperate 2 \nand boreal biomes as these are predicted to be most affected by global warming, which are 3 \nappropriate for landscape scale land surface models, c) evaluate whether there are local adaptations 4 \nof green-up apparent within the biomes and d) explore the possible future change in green-up. 5 \nAs we consider large spatial scales we do not refer to \u201cleaf budburst\u201d, which suggests local scale or 6 \nindividual plants, and instead use the term \u201cgreen-up\u201d by which we mean the time of the beginning 7 \nof landscape scale leaf display. 8 \n2. Data and Methods 9 \n2.1. Input data sets 10 \n2.1.1. Land cover 11 \nWe use the University of Maryland (UMd) 0.5\u00d70.5\no\n global land cover from the International 12 \nSatellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) initiative II (Hall et al., 2005; Hansen et al., 13 \n2000) as vegetation distribution. It distinguishes 14 classes and details the percentage cover of each 14 \nclass for each 0.5\u00d70.5\no\n pixel. We consider the following classes (1) Evergreen Needleleaf Forest 15 \n(ENF), (3) Deciduous Needleleaf Forest (DNF), (4) Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF), (5) Mixed 16 \nForests (MixF), (6) Woodlands (Wdld), and (9) Open Shrublands (OpSh) (Table 1). The UMd land-17 \ncover data set also details the percentage cover of each class for each 0.5\u00d70.5\no\n pixel. The 18 \nclassification does not distinguish between tropical and temperate broadleaf forests; thus DBF 19 \ncomprises temperate deciduous and tropical dry deciduous broadleaf forest. The phenological 20 \nprocesses of temperate (and boreal) and tropical vegetation are, however, determined by different 21 \nclimate variables; we limit ourselves here to the temperate and boreal areas and we identify these 22 \nareas based on latitude (section 2.3). 23 \n Page 7   \n \n \n \n2.1.2. NDVI  1 \nWe use the 10-day, 0.5\u00d70.5\no\n NDVI data from ISLSCP II (FASIR NDVI version 4.131) for the 2 \nyears 1984-1995, that are derived from the Pathfinder AVHRR Land project (PAL) data. PAL data 3 \nare corrected for sensor degradation, atmospheric ozone absorption, Rayleigh scattering and sensor 4 \ndifferences of successive NOAA platforms (James and Kalluri, 1994). The FASIR (Fourier 5 \nadjusted, sensor and solar zenith angle corrected, interpolated and reconstructed) NDVI is 6 \nadditionally corrected for: (1) residual sensor degradation and differences in sensor calibration (Los, 7 \n1998), (2) volcanic aerosol effects resulting from the eruption of El Chichon (1982) and Mt 8 \nPinatubo (1991) (Los et al., 2000), (3) BRDF effects (Los et al., 2005), (4) dense cloud cover over 9 \ntropical forests (Behrenfeld et al., 2001), (5) short-term atmospheric and cloud effects (Los et al., 10 \n2000; Sellers et al., 1996), and (6) missing winter data over the boreal forest (Los et al., 2000; 11 \nSellers et al., 1996). 12 \nUsing 10-day instead of monthly NDVI partially remedies the fact that the NDVI tends to be biased 13 \ntowards later dates in the early growing season due to the maximum value compositing during 14 \nprocessing of the NDVI (Holben, 1986; James and Kalluri, 1994). 15 \nTo evaluate the effect of the interpolation and adjustment of the FASIR data on derived green-up 16 \ndates we also use the data set without the Fourier Adjustment and Interpolation corrections and 17 \nrefer to these data as viASR. 18 \nWe selected the FASIR NDVI data in order to have a long consistent time series of RS data 19 \nconcurrent with a consistent, observation based consistent global temperature data set (the GSWP-2 20 \ndata of Zhao and Dirmeyer (2003) (see 2.1.4). A larger number of years allows for a better 21 \ncalibration and evaluation of the green-up models than would be possible with fewer years. We 22 \nresolve the problem of erroneously identifying snow-melt as green-up by considering snow cover 23 \ndata (Armstrong and Brodzik, 2002).  24 \n2.1.3. Snow cover  25 \n Page 8   \n \n \n \nThe NDVI is sensitive to the presence of snow; snowmelt and green-up have similar radiative 1 \nsignatures in the AVHRR NDVI, as do snowfall and leaf-fall (Shabanov et al., 2002). We therefore 2 \nuse the weekly 25 km snow cover data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) 3 \n(Armstrong and Brodzik, 2002) to determine periods of snow cover for each pixel. We consider a 4 \npixel to be snow covered if the central point is snow covered according to these data in the week 5 \nthat has the largest temporal overlap with the 10-day period of the NDVI data under consideration. 6 \n2.1.4. Temperature 7 \nFor the determination of GDDs and NCDs for the phenology models we use daily averages of the 8 \nglobal 3 hourly, 1\u00d71\u00b0 near surface temperature reanalysis data from the NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2 9 \nwhich were hybridized with the University of East Anglia CRU data set 1983-1996 from the 10 \nGSWP-2 (Zhao and Dirmeyer, 2003). 11 \nTo evaluate the potential future changes in the time of green-up we use climate predictions for 12 \n2051-2060 from the MPI ECHAM5 GCM for the IPCC Forth Assessment Report (FAR) 13 \n(obtainable from PCMDI: http:\/\/www-pcmdi.llnl.gov\/ipcc\/about_ipcc.php). We use two contrasting 14 \nclimate change scenarios, SRES A2 and B1, to span a range of temperature predictions: the A2 15 \nstoryline describes a very heterogeneous world with high  population growth and a significant 16 \nincrease in global temperatures; and the B1 storyline describes a convergent world with low 17 \npopulation growth and a more moderate increase in global temperatures (IPCC, 2000). We use the 18 \ndata for 1981-2000 from the 20\nth\n century climate simulation for comparison and data adjustment as 19 \nfollows: we reduce the biases due to an incorrect mean state of the GCM by calculating daily 20 \nanomalies for all simulations and adding them to the 1983-1995 mean of the GSWP-2 daily means. 21 \nThe anomalies are calculated for each day of the 10 years of the projections 2051-2060 and for 22 \n1986-1995 with respect to the 2046-2065 and the 1981-2000 means respectively. For comparing 23 \nwith the 20\nth\n century climate simulation we add the simulated 1986-1995 daily anomalies to the 24 \n1983-1995 means of the GSWP-2 temperatures. For comparing with climate change projections we 25 \n Page 9   \n \n \n \nadd the difference between the simulated 2046-2065 and the 1981-2000 daily means to the daily 1 \nmeans of the GSWP-2 temperatures, to account for the mean change in climate, and then add the 2 \ndaily 2051-2060 anomalies. 3 \n2.2. Determination of green-up from NDVI 4 \nOur derivation of green-up models (Figure 1) starts with the determination of green-up from NDVI 5 \nseparately for each 0.5\no\n pixel. Several methods to determine a \u201cleaf-out date\u201d from remotely sensed 6 \ndata exist. For example, White et al., (1997) calculate green up from the midpoint between the 7 \nannual minimum and maximum NDVI. Moulin et al., (1997) determine green-up as the largest 8 \nincrease in NDVI above a threshold. Kaduk and Heimann, (1996) use the largest increase in the 9 \nNDVI after the mean monthly temperature reached 5\no\nC as an indication of green-up. More recently, 10 \nKang et al. (2003) explored a threshold approach similar to the one of White et al. (1997) using 11 \nMODIS leaf area index (LAI) data. Zhang et al. (2003) propose the time of the largest curvature of 12 \nexponential functions fitted to the EVI as the time of green-up.  13 \nFor detecting green-up in northern latitudes it is crucial to distinguish between the NDVI increases 14 \nrelated to snow melt and to greening of vegetation. This problem is dealt with in different ways: 15 \nWhite et al., (1997) use a large NDVI threshold, Kaduk and Heimann (1996) use a temperature 16 \nthreshold above which snow occurrence is unlikely, Zhang et al. (2003) use quality assurance (QA) 17 \nflags to select snow free NDVI data. Delbart et al. (2005) used the Normalized Difference Water 18 \nIndex (NDWI), which is sensitive to water on the land surface and therefore potentially allows for 19 \ndetermination of the time period between snow-melt and budburst. However, the NDWI is only 20 \navailable for a limited number of years and does not overlap with the GSWP-II data. Moreover, the 21 \nNDWI can not detect vegetation greenness changes if the soil surface is already very wet (saturated 22 \nor standing water), which is common after snow melt, and there are issues with the calibration that 23 \n Page 10   \n \n \n \nimpact the trend in the data (H\u00fcttich et al., 2006). We therefore prefer to use snow cover data to 1 \nexplicitly indicate the end of snow melt and potential begin of large scale green-up. 2 \n 3 \nWe use the following methods to infer green-up from the NDVI data: 4 \na) the relative threshold based method of White et al. (1997),  5 \nb) a curvature method similar to the approach of Zhang et al. (2003), though, instead of determining 6 \nthe maximum curvature of fitted exponentials, we simply fit cubic splines (natural) to the NDVI 7 \n(using the spline function from (Press et al., 2002)) and record the date of the largest second 8 \nderivative of the spline before the maximal NDVI in a year as the time of green-up, 9 \nc) a method incorporating a climate condition (Kaduk and Heimann, 1996), which we modify by 10 \ntaking the largest increase in NDVI after the 30 day running mean temperature reached 5\no\nC, instead 11 \nof the mean monthly temperature, and  12 \nd) the curvature method of Moulin et al. (1997) for which we exclude \u201cevergreen\u201d and \u201cdesert\u201d 13 \npixels. Note, however, that we are using a different NDVI and vegetation classification than Moulin 14 \net al. (1997). We record the time of the first minimum of the index as defined by Moulin et al. 15 \n(1997) before the maximal NDVI of the year as the time of green-up. 16 \nAll these four methods detect green-up for a pixel based on the information relating to that pixel. 17 \nThey are therefore insensitive to changes of the optical properties of the surface across the fairly 18 \nlarge land cover classes. 19 \nFor all methods we set green-up to occur on day five of the 10 day period for which it is indicated 20 \nby the NDVI data. We record whether the pixel is still snow covered according to the snow cover 21 \ndata and determine the first snow free detection. 22 \n2.3. Definition of biome areas 23 \n Page 11   \n \n \n \nThe UMd land cover classes reflect only plant growth form and do not represent meaningful biomes 1 \nin the sense of an assemblage of climate adapted plant functional types. Our aim here is to define 2 \nlarge scale bioclimatic regions by being as inclusive as possible but still arrive at meaningful 3 \ndelineations of temperate and boreal biomes. We therefore divide the UMd land cover classes 4 \nmainly on the basis of latitude. This implicitly uses climate, since temperature and latitude are 5 \ncorrelated, however, it stills result in more varied biomes. We accept more variation in the 6 \noccurrence of plant functional types in our biomes and thus potentially larger errors in the derived 7 \ngreen-up models to gain wider applicability of the models. To support the selection of the latitudes 8 \ndelineating the biomes we also examined the growing degree days (GDD, Sf(t), for the definitions of 9 \nsymbols see Table 2), and the number of chilling days (NCD, Sc(t)) at green-up. We used the 10 \nfollowing set of rules: 11 \n- For Evergreen Needleleaf Forest  (ENF) pixels located south of 45\no\nN predominantly in the 12 \nsouthern US and southern Japan (Figure 2, Figure 4) show high GDD at green-up. We do not 13 \nconsider these areas to be temperate or boreal coniferous forest and limit our analysis to areas north 14 \nof 45\no\nN. 15 \n- In Deciduous Needleleaf Forest (DNF) six pixels showed high GDD and NCD according to 16 \nmethod c) compared to all other pixels. All of them were located west of 100\no\nE, in the more western 17 \npopulation of deciduous needleleaf forest dominated by Larch (Figure 2). We exclude the eight 18 \npixels of this biome west of 100\no\nE from our analysis. While this might bias our analysis towards the 19 \nmore eastern Larch stands, we believe that potential misclassification (these 8 pixels have just about 20 \n50% cover by class 3) justifies the exclusion. 21 \n- For Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF) the areas south of 30\no\nN which showed rather high GDD 22 \nand low NCD are excluded. These pixels are located on Yukatan and in South-East Asia, which we 23 \ndo not consider temperate deciduous forest. For this biome we limit our analysis therefore to areas 24 \nNorth of 30\no\nN. 25 \n Page 12   \n \n \n \n- In Mixed Forest (MixF) and Woodland (Wdld) we consider here only the areas north of 45\no\nN. The 1 \nNCD and GDD requirements seem to be quite different north and south of 45\no\nN (Figure 3). This 2 \nreasonable as in Mediterranean climate a limited number of cold days can serve as an indicator that 3 \nthe winter is over, whereas in the more temperate and boreal areas a higher chilling requirement is 4 \nappropriate.  5 \n- From Open Shrublands (OpSh), which comprises tundra and deserts in the interior of the 6 \ncontinents south of 45\no\nN, which tend to have rain driven phenology, we want to consider mainly the 7 \ntundra. We limit our analysis therefore to the area north of 50\no\nN (we use 50 instead of 45\no\nN solely 8 \nto exclude the Gobi completely). We also excluded one pixel at 70\no\nN, which had a GDD of more 9 \nthan 1200 in method c). 10 \n 11 \nWe also exclude all pixels that have a GDD larger than 1000 in order to remove the extreme tail of 12 \nthe GDD distribution. This condition resulted in dropping only around 5% and 2% of the data in 13 \nbiomes ENF and DBF respectively, and of less than 1% in the other biomes. 14 \n 15 \nThese restrictions allow us to focus on homogeneous bioclimatic areas, which are ecologically 16 \nmeaningful in contrast to whole land cover classes and we will therefore refer to the areas described 17 \nabove as \u201cbiomes\u201d instead of land cover classes. Also, we retain a suitable number of pixels per 18 \nbiome for the derivation of the phenological models (Table 1, column 6), although there are only 19 \n237 pixels in DNF and about 169 in DBF. There are, however, only 245 and 233 pixels in land 20 \ncover class DNF and DBF respectively in the northern Hemisphere; the reduced number of pixels in 21 \nDBF results from the  exclusion of Yukatan. 22 \n2.4. Phenological models for leaf budburst 23 \n Page 13   \n \n \n \nFour models describing the time of budburst, tbb (see Table 2), of temperate plants in response to  1 \ntemperature have typically been used in the literature: the Spring Warming Model, the Sequential 2 \nModel, the Parallel Model and the Alternating Model (Chuine et al., 1998; Hanninen et al., 1990; 3 \nKramer, 1996; Murray et al., 1989; Sarvas, 1974). In all models budburst occurs when GDD 4 \nexceeds a threshold F\n*\n, i.e. tbb = tF*. These four models reflect different assumptions about the 5 \necophysiology of the budburst process. 6 \n In the Spring Warming Model (SWM) forcing units for budburst, Rf(t), are accumulated from a 7 \nfixed date (e.g. 1 January) and F\n* \nis constant. It therefore assumes that there is no internal state 8 \nof dormancy or rest of the buds, which needs to be broken by chilling; leaf buds react at any 9 \ntime in the same way to increasing temperatures. We compare our more complex models, 10 \nwhich consider a chilling effect, with this model to evaluate the importance of including 11 \nchilling in green-up models.   . 12 \n The Sequential Model postulates that budburst is not possible at all until dormancy has been 13 \nbroken by a certain amount of chilling, the chilling requirement, C\n*\n. 14 \n The Parallel Model weakens the assumptions of the Sequential model; the effectiveness of the 15 \ntemperature forcing is only reduced if the chilling requirement is not fulfilled: chilling, Rc(t), 16 \nand Rf(t) accumulate in parallel, but chilling states below C\n*\n reduce the rate of forcing. 17 \n The Alternating Model (AM) uses a variable F*, to weaken the assumption of the Sequential 18 \nmodel: F\n*\n drops exponentially with increasing chilling state, Sc(t). There is some confusion in 19 \nthe literature as to whether or not there is a fixed chilling requirement in the Alternating Model, 20 \nwhich prevents accumulation of the warming until it is fulfilled. (Chuine et al., 1998) postulate 21 \nsuch a requirement whereas other authors do not include it (Kramer, 1996; Murray et al., 1989). 22 \nWe follow (Murray et al., 1989) and do not include such a fixed chilling requirement in the 23 \nAlternating Model.  24 \n Page 14   \n \n \n \nIn all models the temperature thresholds for the accumulation of chilling or forcing units (Tc , Tf), 1 \nare assumed to be constant and species specific. However, models may reduce the effectiveness of 2 \nchilling or forcing temperatures, i.e. reduce Rc(t) or Rf(t), above or below these thresholds, 3 \nrespectively (Chuine et al., 1998; Kramer, 1996; Murray et al., 1989).  4 \nSince many authors found an exponential relationship between F\n*\n and Sc(t) (Chuine et al., 1998, 5 \n1999; Heide, 1993; Murray et al., 1989; Myking, 1997; Zhang et al., 2004) we focus here on the 6 \nAM, as the other models do not allow for the frequently observed relationship between the amount 7 \nof warming and chilling  required for budburst.  8 \nWe modify the AM, F1, and introduce an explicit dependence on the local mean annual or mean 9 \nwinter temperature (Table 2, functions Fi , i=2,\u2026,5), and explore them together with the SWM (F0) 10 \nand AM (F1) across our biomes for the northern hemisphere. The inclusion of a temperature mean 11 \nallows in particular explicitly capturing changes in phenology within single biomes in the model. 12 \nThe SWM is a special case of all other models if the chilling requirement, or the effect of annual 13 \nmean temperature on the bud burst threshold is set to zero.  14 \nThrough this hierarchy of models we explore whether the inclusion of chilling improves the green-15 \nup prediction using the SWM as a reference model. We evaluate through the modifications (Fi , 16 \ni=2,\u2026,5) of the standard AM, F1, whether the inclusion of provenance, as reflected by local mean 17 \nannual temperatures (previous January to January mean), Ta, or mean winter (November, 18 \nDecember, January) temperature, Tw, improves the models. Note that, according to Taylor\u2019s 19 \nTheorem model 3 (function F3), is the first order approximation of any model that assumes a 20 \n(reasonably) smooth dependence of the coefficients in F1 on T. In other words F3 is the first order 21 \napproximation of any model of the form: )(t)S)(exp()()()( cTcTbTatF  with regular a(T), 22 \nb(T), and c(T). Thus, evaluating model 3 in fact evaluates to first order any model that uses 23 \ntemperature dependent coefficients in F1.  24 \n2.5. Model calibration 25 \n Page 15   \n \n \n \nModels are parameterized by least squares. We first fit all six models F0\u2013F5 (Table 2) to all sets of 1 \ngreen-up dates obtained from the four methods a)-d). GDD and NCD at the time of green-up and Tx 2 \n(x=a,w) for each of the 12 years (1984 \u2013 1995) and each biome. This results in 480 cases per biome. 3 \nTo limit the number of parameters and ensure that (first and second) derivatives of the models exist, 4 \nwe fix the starting dates (tC0, and tF0) for Sc(t) or Sf(t) to the first of November and the first of 5 \nJanuary, respectively (Murray et al., 1989). We also set the threshold temperatures for chilling and 6 \nforcing to zero, Tc = Tf  = 0 (Heide, 1993; Myking, 1997; Zhang et al., 2004). The functions Fi, 7 \ni=0,\u2026,5, then depend only on the parameters aj, bk, and cl, and can be differentiated with respect to 8 \nall their parameters. If we would allow start dates and thresholds to vary as well, then the 9 \ndifferentials are climate dependent and the recalculation of the derivatives requires larger 10 \ncomputational resources. We use a varpro algorithm for nonlinear least squares (netlib.org), with a 11 \ngradient method using derivatives, and for comparison with (Chuine et al., 1998) a simulated 12 \nannealing implementation (Press et al., 2002).  13 \n 14 \nThe models were calibrated on one year of data and on the entire record of 12 years. Calibrating the 15 \nmodels on a single year of data however leads to overfitting, i.e. the models are specific to that one 16 \nyear. Consequently the models cannot portray well a more generalized relationship reflecting the 17 \nconditions in other years and have reduced predictive power (Smith, 1996). The \u201cbest\u201d model 18 \nwould be obtained by using all available data, but this would preclude evaluation of the  model. A 19 \nmethod that avoids overfitting and allows assessment of predictive power of a model is the leave-20 \none-out (LOO) cross-validation (CV) (Allen, 1974) which we use here. We partition the data into 21 \n12 sets of 11 years to calibrate the model and 1 year for validation by leaving out each year once. 22 \nAll four models are calibrated and validated on these 12 sets. The LOO CV method avoids 23 \noverfitting (Ng, 1997),  reduces bias introduced by relying on any one particular division of the data 24 \n(Allen, 1974) and yields uncertainty estimates for the parameters. 25 \n Page 16   \n \n \n \n2.6. Statistical methods 1 \nTo evaluate differences between any two sets of modelled GDD data or green-up dates from NDVI 2 \nor the different functions F0\u2013F5 we use the paired two sample Wilcoxon rank sum test, with the Null 3 \nhypothesis, H0, of equal means, to test whether the modelled means are the same. To determine 4 \nwhether there is a difference in the distribution of the modelled data between any two of the F1\u2013F5 5 \nwe use in addition the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, with H0 of equal distributions. Tests are 6 \nconducted using the implementations in R (R Development Core Team, 2005). 7 \n3. Results 8 \n3.1. Green-up dates from remote sensing 9 \nThe curvature methods b) and d) detect green-up when large fractions of pixels are actually still 10 \nsnow covered (Table 3, Table 4). This leaves too few pixels for deriving green-up models that are 11 \nmeaningful for whole biomes. Detection of green-up during the snow free period can be forced, e.g. 12 \nby excluding snow covered times, or by using NDVI values from snow free times to fill the snow 13 \ncovered period for evergreen biomes. This will lead, however, to other artefacts; any function fitted 14 \nto the NDVI data filled with a recent snow free value will still have its maximal curvature very 15 \nclose to the time of snow melt (Figure 4). We therefore focus our analysis methods a) and c) that are 16 \nless sensitive to snow artefacts. 17 \n 18 \nMethod a) of (White et al., 1997) detects green-up 10-40 days later than the curvature methods 19 \n(Table 5) and significant fractions of pixels are snow free according to the snow cover data (Table 20 \n4). Thus the significant increases in NDVI detected by method a) reflect increases in leaf area 21 \nindex, LAI, rather than changes in snow cover.  22 \n Page 17   \n \n \n \nCompared to method a) method c) indicates 8-10 days later green-up except for DBF where the 1 \nmean green-up times are only a day apart  (Table 4).  2 \n 3 \nTo evaluate the impact of the smoothing by the Fourier adjustment and Interpolation of the FASIR 4 \ncorrections on the inferred time of green-up we determined green-up using the viASR data. Method 5 \na) detects green-up within five days of the FASIR data for DNF, DBF, MixF and Wdld. For ENF 6 \nthe average green-up based on the viASR data is 11 days earlier. This is due to the fact that the for 7 \nENF the October values are used in the FASIR winter data. Thus the minimum (winter) NDVI 8 \nvalue for the FASIR data is larger than for the viSAR data and therefore the half range is reached 9 \nlater in the year. The 11 days earlier green-up implies, however, that more pixels will be affected by 10 \nsnow cover at green-up (compare to the green-up dates from method b). We consider therefore the 11 \ngreen-up derived from the FASIR data to be more realistic for ENF. For OpSh  the viASR data lead 12 \nto 15 days later estimates of green-up for the snow free pixels and 9 days later estimates of green-up 13 \nfor all pixels. This results from the fact that the viASR data comprise many points in the far north 14 \nwhich have only data from the late spring until autumn. These points have either been excluded 15 \nfrom the FASIR data or they have been filled with low values. The latter leads to detection of an 16 \nearlier green-up with method a) on the FASIR data. Again we consider green-up dates obtained 17 \nwith the FASIR data to be more appropriate. 18 \n 19 \nThe mean green-up time of the region 35\no\nN-75\no\nN determined via method a) shows a trend of about  20 \nfour days to earlier times for the 12 years considered here (-0.36 d\/a for 1986-1995), which is well 21 \nin line with in situ observations (Menzel, 2000; Menzel and Fabian, 1999), e.g. 0.3-0.5 days per 22 \nyear in Europe from in situ observations in phenological gardens (Menzel, 2000), and other 23 \nevaluations of remote sensing observations. 24 \n3.2. Calibration of the phenological models  25 \n Page 18   \n \n \n \nFunctions F2, F4 and F5 (see Table 2) turn out to be difficult to calibrate. The varpro algorithm 1 \nvirtually always fails for function F4, for all biomes and all years, mostly due to ill-conditioning. F5 2 \ncan only be fitted in about half of the cases and F2 in half to two thirds. F0 can always be fitted 3 \nwhile the fitting of F1 and F3 fails only in about a sixth of the cases (Table 5).  4 \nThe mean 1984-1995 residuals of the GDD fits are in general largest for F0 and smallest for F5, as 5 \nexpected from the number of parameters. The residuals for F4 are typically the second largest, 6 \nbecause an optimal parameter set could not be found for a large number of cases; so the model is 7 \nnot appropriate for describing the green-up dates despite its complexity. The fits of F2 and F3 have 8 \nvery similar residuals, which are somewhat smaller than the ones of F1 and in general only a little 9 \nlarger than the ones of F5 (Table 5). Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon rank sum tests suggest 10 \nthat except for three cases there is no significant difference (p<0.05) between the residuals of the 11 \nfits of F2 and F3, and for these three cases F3 allows the better fits. Where the tests suggests a 12 \ndifference in the fits between functions F3 and F5, the difference is small and there are only 2-5 13 \nyears for which F3 and F5 could both be fitted making the tests uncertain and potential gains from 14 \nusing F5 small. 15 \n 16 \nUsing simulated annealing to determine the models gives only slightly different results. Again, the 17 \nresiduals for F0 are larger than those from F1, F2, and F3, but residuals for F5 remain large which 18 \nprobably reflects that no unique solution could be found for the large parameter space. Again, F4 19 \neither results in large residuals or the algorithm fails. While with simulated annealing the residuals 20 \nfor F3 are consistently smaller than the ones for F1 and F2, there is most likely again no significant 21 \ndifference between F2, and F3. 22 \n 23 \nTrading simplicity and appropriateness versus accuracy of the models suggests disregarding F2, F4 24 \nand F5 (Table 5). The NCD-GDD relationships were appropriately described with F0, F1 and F3; 25 \n Page 19   \n \n \n \ncontrolled experiments also suggest that a single exponential relationship is appropriate for 1 \nmodelling these relationships (Hunter and Lechowicz, 1992; Kramer, 1994; Murray et al., 1989) 2 \nWe conclude that any dependence on the mean winter or annual temperature can be well described 3 \nby using temperature dependent parameters in F1, which leads to F3, and that additional terms, as in 4 \nF2, F4 and F5, are redundant as they do not lead to improved models.  5 \n 6 \n3.3. Statistical analysis  7 \nCalibrating the models on single years leads to overfitting of the models and to low predictive 8 \npower. For all methods, biomes and models the 12-year mean error of the green-up predictions 9 \nmore than 50% higher than the error for the year on which the model was calibrated. The prediction 10 \nerror increases if the calibration error decreases \u2013 the better the reproduction of the calibration data 11 \nthe worse the generalization to other years. 12 \nThe mean prediction errors from LOO CV varpro calibrations (see 2.5), i.e. the errors on the years 13 \nnot used for calibration, are nearly as small as the mean errors of the models calibrated for one year 14 \non the calibration data (Table 6). In other words the general models obtained from calibration on 11 15 \nyears of data have a mean prediction error approaching the mean error of overfitted models on the 16 \none calibration year. Also, the LOO CV approach results in acceptable models where these models 17 \ncannot be determined from single years of data (see DNF in Table 6). 18 \n 19 \nThe biome mean absolute calibration errors of the GDD at green-up for the 12 years 1984-1995 20 \nfrom LOO CV are significantly larger for F0 than for F1 for all biomes as indicated by a paired 21 \nWilcoxon signed rank test (all p-values < 0.025). This shows that including a chilling requirement 22 \nleads to better model calibration. 23 \n Page 20   \n \n \n \n The calibration errors of the GDD at green-up of F3, using Ta, is significantly smaller than the one 1 \nfor F1 for biomes ENF, DBF, and Wdld (all p-values < 0.05). For OpSh the p value for 3 years is 2 \nlarge leading to a 12 year mean of p=0.11. Using Tw with model F3 is not significantly better than 3 \nusing Ta for biomes DBF, Wdld and OpSh. For biome ENF using Tw leads to smaller calibration 4 \nerrors and for MixF F3 can be fitted, which was not possible with Ta, with smaller errors than for F1. 5 \nDo for the biomes ENF, DBF, MixF, Wdld and OpSh considering temperature dependent 6 \nparameters reduces the calibration error compared to constant parameters, even when a chilling 7 \nrequirement is included. 8 \n 9 \nThe prediction errors for the green-up date show that model F1 gives significant lower errors than 10 \nmodel F0 for ENF, DNF, DBF, MixF with mean p< 0.05, for Wdld with p<0.1, and OpSh with 11 \np<0.17; the mean p for OpSh is dominated by one p value for one year close to 1.  12 \nModel F3 with Ta is significantly better (p<0.05) than F1 for OpSh and Wdld as well as ENF if one 13 \nor two years with p close to one are excluded. For DBF the prediction error from F3 is not 14 \nconsistently smaller than that from F1. For ENF model F3 with Tw is significantly better than F1 15 \n(p<0.05). For MixF for all but 3 years the prediction errors of model F3(Tw) are significantly smaller 16 \nthan the ones of F1. 17 \n 18 \nThe fits from method c) do not allow significantly more accurate predictions than the ones from 19 \nmethod a) except in DNF and OpSh. These are the biomes where the green-up detected by the 20 \nmethods is most different (Table 4). Any higher accuracy of method c), however, might just simply 21 \nresult from the climate condition of the method as any regularity of year to year temperatures will 22 \nincrease its predictive accuracy. We therefore suggest that the method tends to predict when the 23 \nrunning mean temperature reaches 5\no\nC and not so much green-up.   24 \n Page 21   \n \n \n \n3.4. Sensitivity of green-up models to current climate and 21st century 1 \nwarming projections 2 \nMean observed green-up (1986-1995) according to method a) occurred at day 144 compared to a 3 \nprediction of day 145.9  simulated using our best models (Table 8) and the GSWP2 temperatures. 4 \nSimulating green-up with the temperatures from the 20\nth\n century climate model control run leads to 5 \na mean green-up day of 146.6. The simulated green-up times are consistently slightly later (~2 6 \ndays), as indicated by the 10 year means, but interannual variability is very similar between 7 \nobservations and simulations (Figure 6). The latitudinal distribution of observations and simulations 8 \nagrees well, with the exception of the green-up simulated using the climate model temperatures for 9 \nthe region 35\no\nN-42\no\nN where the green-up is estimated quite early (Figure 7). As expected from the 10 \nprevious sections our best models, which all include a chilling requirement, predict an earlier and 11 \ntherefore more appropriate time of green-up for the 20\nth\n century climate simulation than the spring 12 \nwarming models, F0, we also determined (Figure 8). 13 \nThe simulated green-up under the B1 scenario of climate change in 2050-2060 is on average 4-5 14 \ndays earlier than the green-up simulated with the 20\nth\n century control run 1985-1996 (Figure 8). The 15 \nA2 climate leads to 1-2 days earlier green-up than the B1 climate. The spring warming models 16 \nsuggest an even larger advance of green-up of 7-9 days in the 2050s for the A2 scenario. This 17 \nindicates  that chilling requirements are no longer fulfilled in the A2 scenario and the warming 18 \ncannot compensate for the loss of NCD required for green-up.  19 \nRegionally, larger changes in the green-up data (up to nearly two weeks earlier) are predicted in 20 \ncentral Europe, Russia, Northern Siberia and the Rocky mountains (Figure 9). 21 \n4. Discussion 22 \n Page 22   \n \n \n \nOur results indicate that method a) of (White et al., 1997) is preferable over the other methods 1 \nconsidered to obtaine green-up estimates from coarse scale AVHRR \u2013 NDVI data. Functions F1 for 2 \nDNF and DBF, F3(Tw) for ENF and MixF and F3(Ta) for the Wdld, and OpSh provide the best 3 \nmodels for prediction of the time of green-up. F0 does, however, provide a nearly as good a model 4 \nfor DNF as F1.  5 \nZhang et al. (2003) determined a generic relationship between NCD and GDD for northern forests 6 \nusing one year of data with a variation of method b). EVI affected by snow cover, as indicated by 7 \nthe QA flags, are substituted with the most recent snow free value. Our results indicate that the 8 \ngreen-up dates determined by this methods are influenced by the snow melt time (as discussed in 9 \n3.1). Moreover, we expect that their model cannot be transferred to the analysis of other years 10 \nwithout further calibration. Moulin et al. (1997) also found that their curvature based method should 11 \nnot be used when there is a significant amount of snow cover. 12 \nMethod c) is strongly determined directly by climate variations and was less successful in 13 \npredicting variations in vegetation activity. It relies on a constant relationship of climate properties 14 \nand vegetation activity and is likely to break down when this relationship changes, e.g. due to 15 \nclimate change. Moreover, method c) does not lead to significantly more reliable models than 16 \nmethod a) (see 3.3). We therefore will not consider it further. 17 \nOverall we prefer method a). It resulted in small residuals and reproduced the trend to earlier 18 \nobserved green-up over the time period 1984-1995 in line with in situ observations. The method 19 \nprovides reasonable estimates for the time of green-up; the green-up dates determined with this 20 \nmethod are only 10-20 days after snowmelt. This estimate more or less agrees with the time of 21 \nmajor leaf expansion (Marell et al., 2006; Pornon and Lamaze, 2007 ). (White et al., 2009) 22 \ncompared  of 10 methods to detect green-up from RS and also found that our method a) 23 \n(Midpointpixel of (White et al., 2009)) was one of the only two that was well correlated to start of 24 \nspring (SOS) measures and resulted in a low bias. They also find that overall NDVI based SOS 25 \n Page 23   \n \n \n \nestimates best match with observations of \u201cfirst leaf appearance\u201d. (Shutova et al., 2006) shows a 1 \nhigh correlation to in-situ phenology data across Fennoscandia with results from their method to 2 \ndetect the start of the growing season, which is very similar to our method a).  3 \nOur model fitting indicates that a chilling requirement present in the all temperate and boreal 4 \nbiomes we considered   5 \n 6 \nThe fact that the AM (F1) model accurately predicts green up in biomes DNF and DBF suggests that 7 \nthere is no significant adaptation of the phenology of green-up to the local mean temperatures. This  8 \nfinding is supported by studies on European tree species: Kramer\u2019s (1995) study of seven European 9 \ntree species found no significant difference of leaf unfolding times between local and transplanted 10 \nindividuals of the same species from different latitudinal ranges. Chuine et al. (1998) also found 11 \nthat only one out of eight European deciduous broadleaf species showed a limited local adaptation 12 \nof its flowering time. This implies that it is not justified to include local adaptations of phenology 13 \ninto the model for these biomes. 14 \nFor biomes ENF, MixF, Wdld, and OpSh, which cover larger and diverse areas, our model fitting 15 \nfinds significant adaptation of phenology and\/or species to the local climate, as the models improve 16 \nwhen mean annual or winter temperature are included. 17 \n 18 \nThe error spread in green-up date from our models compare well with results of other authors. For 19 \nexample (Picard et al., 2005) find RMSE of 5-8 days for their budburst models for one limited 20 \nregion in  Siberia, which should be compared the RMSE of our model predictions of 3.8-8.4 days 21 \nfor DNF and 8.5-14.3 days for OpSh. (R\u00f6tzer et al., 2004) find MAE of 4.7 and 4.9 days for their 22 \nmodels for the leafing in south-east Germany of Quercus robur and Fagus sylvetica, respectively, 23 \nwhich should be compared to our MAE of about 9.6 days for DBF; and MAE of 4.4 and 5 days for 24 \nthe May shoot of Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris  which should be compared to our MAE of about 25 \n Page 24   \n \n \n \n10 and 8 days for ENF and MixF, respectively. Since our models apply for whole northern 1 \nhemisphere biomes, instead of single species or limited regions, for which much better models 2 \nshould be expected, our results are very acceptable. They also compare favourably with the errors in 3 \na RS based analysis by (Botta et al., 2000) who found  RMSE in the range of 10-20 days, depending 4 \non the biome). 5 \n 6 \nCalibrating models with small data sets , e.g. just one year of data or a small region (e.g. (Chuine 7 \nand Cour, 1999; Kaduk and Heimann, 1996; Picard et al., 2005), leads to overfitted models which 8 \nhave limited predictive power, underestimate the uncertainty for the calibration year, and 9 \noverestimate the prediction error (Smith, 1996). For example, when (Picard et al., 2005) fit their 10 \nmodel separately to four years, the overfitting is evident from the four very different parameter sets 11 \nthey obtain  (e.g. their F\n*\n varies from 23 to 269), which might not even be physiologically 12 \nreasonable. F\n*\n should reflect the warming requirement and one would not expect such a large 13 \nvariation from year to year. If Picard et al. (2005) calibrate their model with all four years they 14 \nobtain ecologically reasonable values of 4.1\no\nC for Tb, and 65 for F\n*\n. Parameter uncertainty and 15 \nprediction error, however, remain unclear. 16 \nContrary to this, with LOO CV we obtain well supported parameter values with an uncertainty 17 \nrange (Table 7). Our parameter estimates are very consistent between calibrations, as each relies on 18 \n11 years, and should therefore reflect mainly the phenological processes and less so any interannual 19 \nvariability. The parameter range from the LOO calibrations provides an estimate of the uncertainty 20 \nin the parameters obtained from the calibration using all 12 years of data. 21 \nMoreover we obtain a robust estimate of the prediction error. Due to the continuity of the error as a 22 \nfunction of the parameters of the models one may assume that the mean prediction error from the 12 23 \nLOO CV runs reflects the prediction error of the models using all 12 years for calibration.  24 \n 25 \n Page 25   \n \n \n \nThe simulated interannual variability of the time of green-up 1986-1995 using the GSWP 2 as well 1 \nas the 20\nth\n century simulated control temperatures as well as latitudinal variability are quite similar 2 \nto the variability of the observations (Figure 6). This gives confidence that the modelled sensitivity 3 \nis realistic and the models can indicate the sensitivity to future climate change. 4 \nThe fact that our best models all include a chilling requirement and that spring-warming only 5 \nmodels indicate a later, less accurate, green-up suggest that green-up is best described by 6 \naccounting for chilling.  7 \n 8 \nThe dependencies of the model parameters on the mean temperatures of a previous period act in a 9 \nway such that relatively responses become similar. For example the GDD threshold for OpSh 10 \ndecreases as the mean annual temperature decreases. This allows similar accumulation of GDD for 11 \nrelatively cold and warm regions within the same biome. This is somewhat analogue to Linsser\u2019s 12 \nhypothesis (Linsser, 1867) that a growth stage would be reached at some constant fraction of the 13 \nannual heat sum. 14 \n 15 \nThe change in green-up timing from the 1990s to the 2050s for the northern biomes is potentially 16 \nonly about five days on average (Figure 8), which is modest compared to the change over the last 2-17 \n3 decades. The spring warming models indicate a much earlier green-up in the future even though 18 \nthey simulated a later green-up for the past decades than the models including a chilling 19 \nrequirement.  20 \nThis shows that the limited advance of green-up in the future is due to the opposing effects of 21 \nclimate warming on warming and chilling with warming increasing GDD experienced by the biota 22 \nbut also reducing the chilling, increasing the GDD required for green-up.   23 \nRegionally, however, still an up to 15 days earlier green-up is predicted (Figure 9). 24 \n5. Conclusions 25 \n Page 26   \n \n \n \nWhite et al. (1997) proposed a method to detect green up from satellite NDVI data of (mostly) snow 1 \nfree conditions. We found that this method leads to better results than several RS green-up detection 2 \nmethods that cannot distinguish between green up and the end of snow melt.  3 \nWe used the satellite based estimates of green up to derive phenological models to predict green up 4 \nfrom climate data for the  northern hemisphere north of  45\no\nN. Phenological models were derived 5 \nfor ENF, DNF, MixF, and Wdld, north of 30\no\nN for DBF and north of  50\no\nN for OpSh, and these 6 \nmodels are suitable for inclusion into climate models 7 \nThe best model estimates for predicting green-up from chilling and growing degree days have 8 \nacceptable prediction errors between 5 and 10 days (Table 8) as estimated from LOO CV which 9 \ncompares very favourably with other studies.  10 \nTo our knowledge this study is the first one using LOO CV for error estimation of large scale 11 \nphenology models; (H\u00e4kkinen, 1999) used it for Betula Pendula only. Moreover, we not only 12 \nestimate the prediction error, but also obtain a range indicating the uncertainty of the model 13 \nparameters from LOOCV. Using multiple years and LOO CV is critical to obtain stable models that 14 \nare not overfitted and generalize well. 15 \nDetermining phenology models requires observations that cover a broad range of climatic 16 \nconditions as otherwise any relationship between warming and chilling requirement might not be 17 \nreflected in the data. For biomes covering large areas models taking into account a local mean 18 \ntemperature allows a slightly, however significantly, smaller prediction error. This suggests that 19 \nphenology comprises an element of adaptation of vegetation to the local climate. 20 \n 21 \nOur experiments with our best models, which all include a chilling requirement, and the spring-22 \nwarming models using temperature predictions climate model simulations show that the inclusion 23 \nof a chilling requirement in phenology models changes projections of green-up by several days. 24 \nSpring warming models without a chilling requirement predict too late green-up for the current 25 \n Page 27   \n \n \n \nclimate and overestimate the advance of green-up times in future climates. To assess the effect of a 1 \nchanging climate on green up, the balance has to be considered between, increasing GDD  resulting 2 \nin earlier green-up, and decreasing chilling, increasing the GDD requirement. 3 \n6.
