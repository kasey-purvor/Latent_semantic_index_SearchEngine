Borosilicate glass was modified with N,N-\ndiethylaminodithiocarbamoylpropyl(trimethoxy)silane, in order to confine the iniferter reactive \ngroups solely at its surface, then placed in solution with monomers and cross-linker. The \npolymerisation was initiated by UV irradiation.

Upon irradiation TED increases the \nconcentration of passive capping radicals and decreases the possibility of recombination of active \nmacro-radicals, thus prolonging their lifetime. In the absence of TED the thickness of produced \ncoatings was below 10 nm. TED added at different concentrations assisted in the formation of \ngrafted layers of 10-130 nm thickness. Iniferter chemistry in the presence of TED can be used for \ngrowing nanometre-scale polymer layers on solid supports.

Introduction\nMastering the architecture and properties of materials at the nanometre scale is a fundamental step \ntowards the development of leading edge tools in nanotechnology, with practical economic \noutcomes.  Polymeric materials, in particular acrylic- and methacrylic acid based materials, have \nlong been proven suitable for a broad range of applications: separation, recognition, sensing \ntechnologies; and are used in biomedical, environmental, security and food-related areas (Yoshida \net al., 2006). \nMethacrylates are reasonably well characterised and easy to manipulate. Such materials are \npolymerised traditionally in solution by means of initiators of radical nature through a chain \nreaction. Polymerisation is distinguished by: (i) free radical polymerisation, when the radical \ninitiator is produced by homolytic cleavage of covalent bonds; (ii) ionic chain polymerisation, \nwhen cationic and anionic initiators are produced by heterolytic cleavage of ion pairs and (iii) \nliving radical polymerisation, when radicals can be initiated or deactivated in a reversible way\n(Jagur-Grodzinski, 2001).\nIonic chain polymerisation is suitable for a restricted group of ionisable monomers. Free radical \npolymerisation is widely exploited for the preparation of commercial plastics, because it is easy to \nperform, leads to high yield of materials in reasonably short times, and therefore has gained a \ncentral role in polymer science. However, free radical polymerisation leads to a heterogeneous \npopulation of macromolecules, typically with a broad distribution of molecular weights and poor \ncontrol over dimensions (Ward and Peppas, 2000). Among the reasons for the formation of \nstructural heterogeneities in the growing networks, the spontaneous tendency of monomers, cross-\nlinkers and solvent to separate during the polymerisation into uniform clusters in different spatial \nregions is a major factor (Kloosterboer, 1998; Anseth et al., 1996). Such segregation is defined as \nspinodal decomposition (Asnaghi et al., 1995), it generates local environments composed of \nmolecules with similar properties (hydrophobicity and density) and ultimately results in different \nPage 4 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\nmicrogelation environments in the same polymerisation reaction and thereby gives rise to \nheterogeneities. On the contrary, homogeneous materials possess very desirable characteristics, \ne.g. optical properties, conductivity, strength and resistance etc, as evidenced by a comparative \nanalysis of physico-chemical and functional properties of materials with dielectric spectroscopy \n(Kannurpatti and Bowman, 1998). The important practical need for controlled deposition of the \nlayers of cross-linked polymers originates from the development of polymer-based sensors, \nespecially optical sensors such as SPR or fluorescent devices. A possible way to introduce order in \nthe polymerisation process and therefore to control it at a molecular level is to use controlled\/living \nradical polymerisation. Living polymerisation is characterised by reversible transformation of \ndormant species into reactive free-radicals that act as chain propagators. In living polymerisation\nthe rate of initiation is significantly greater than the polymerisation rate (Ruckert et al., 2002).\nAmong the various living iniferters (ini-tiator, trans-fer agent, ter-minator), dithiocarbamate esters \nreact by the photochemical cleavage of the C-S bond (Otsu et al., 1982), leading to the formation \nof two radicals with very different properties. One, derived from the alkyl group, is highly reactive. \nIt initiates polymerisation, which propagates by addition of unsaturated monomers. The other is a \nmuch less reactive (dormant), sulphur-centred radical, that does not react with monomers\n(Lambrinos et al., 1990; Kazmaier et al., 1995) and acts uniquely as a recapping moiety for the \nmacro-radical growing chain. Otsu and co-workers confirmed the living nature of photoiniferter \npolymerisations in bulk and in solution and studied the effect of different reaction conditions on \nthe polymerisation rate and the production of ordered polymeric chains (Otsu et al., 1995). \nMinimal broadening of the molecular weight distribution was observed when the chain extension \nprocess was followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), accounting for the formation of \nhomogeneous macromolecules (Turner and Blevins, 1990). The kinetic behaviour of surface-\ninitiated photo-polymerisation is quite different from that carried out in bulk or in solution and \ntypically has a first-order dependence on monomer concentration (de Boer et al., 2000; Santosh et \nal., 2005). Nonlinear growth of the layers with exposure time indicates that irreversible termination \nPage 5 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\nreactions take place in the system, leading to the loss of surface-tethered free radicals. Therefore, \nphotoiniferter-mediated surface-initiated photopolymerisation was classified as \u201cpseudo-living\u201d \n(Santosh et al., 2005; Santosh et al., 2008). An important and diverse range of materials is\nproduced by polymerisations involving a degree of cross-linking. This results in materials with \ngreater toughness and strength which find uses in a wide variety of applications: from dental \nrestorative preparations (Pavlinec and Moszner, 2003) to contact lenses and optical devices\n(Zwiers and Dortrant, 1985), cell filtration and selective membranes (Natori and Kurita, 2007; \nPiletsky et al., 2000). In particular, cross-linking has practical importance in the synthesis of \nrecognition materials based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) (Piletsky et al., 2000). In \nthis context, iniferter chemistry has a distinct advantage, since the mild experimental conditions \nused in initiation by this method will help to preserve the pre-polymerisation complex, essential \nthe for creation of recognition properties in MIPs.\nRecently living iniferter photopolymerisation has been used for the development of imprinted \nmulti-layers with predetermined selectivities (Ruckert et al., 2002; P\u00e9rez-Moral and Mayes, 2007). \nThe present study is intended to further expand the chemistry basis of this work and provide better \ncontrol over the thickness of surface-confined cross-linked layers, setting the ground for the \nestablishment of a general platform for surface modification, which will favour the growth of \nsurface-anchored cross-linked polymers and might benefit the polymerisation of MIPs at surfaces.\nHere, we used a dithiocarbamate ester-based iniferter covalently bound to a support to grow \ncontrolled surface-grafted polymers. The \u2018grafting from\u2019 approach was employed: the support was \nfirst activated in order to attach the iniferter groups solely at its surface and to confine \npolymerisation to the surface. The ability to control the grafted layer was studied under various \nconditions and upon addition of a chain terminator agent, N,N-N\u2019,N\u2019-tetraethyl thiuram disulphide \n(TED), a symmetrical molecule made of two passive, dormant radicals (Otsu, 2000). The addition \nof TED to the monomer mixture is reported to act on the equilibrium between the active macro-\nradicals and passive radicals and increase the length of the surface growing chains. The overall \nPage 6 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\narchitecture strategy is summarised in Scheme 1. We investigated the effect of TED on polymer \ngrowth, in order to control grafting thickness over the range 5-130 nanometres. The aim was to \nfind a recipe for the growth of nano-scale polymer layers of controlled thickness. The ability to \npredictably grow such layers would help in the design of recognition layers compatible with sensor \nsystems. Moreover it would aid in the design of multi\u2013layer architectures, consequently allowing \nthe optimisation of electrical conductivity and improved diffusion of analytes thus enabling the \npreparation of a new generation of highly sensitive polymer-based sensors.\n2. Experimental\n2.1. Materials\nSodium diethyl dithiocarbamate trihydrate, chloropropyl trimethoxysilane, acetone and 9-\nanthracenylmethyl methacrylate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham, UK). All other \nchemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received. Ultrapure water (Millipore) was \nused for analysis. NMR spectra were obtained using a JEOL ECX-400 multinuclear NMR \nspectrometer. NMR solvents were obtained from Goss Scientific (Chelmsford, UK). \n2.2 Synthesis of N,N-diethylaminodithiocarbamoylpropyl(trimethoxy)silane\nThe synthesis of the silane living iniferter, N,N-\ndiethylaminodithiocarbamoylpropyl(trimethoxy)silane was prepared by a modification of the \nprocedure of Kobayashi et al (1992). Diethyl dithiocarbamate trihydrate (3.42 g) was ground to a \nfine powder in a mortar. The powdered salt was transferred to a flask and the water of \ncrystallisation removed by heating in an oil bath (105\u00b0C), while connected to a vacuum pump for \n10 hours. Dehydrated dithiocarbamate salt (2.65 g) was suspended in 40 mL of dry acetone in a \nflask, fitted with a stirrer and condenser, to which was added an amount of chloropropyl \ntrimethoxysilane (2.48 g) to give a 1.2:1 mol:mol ratio of iniferter:silane. The mixture was heated \nat 45-55\u00b0C. Product, in the form of a yellow oil, was formed after 10-15 hours. At the end of the \nPage 7 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nreaction, the insoluble salts were removed by filtration, and the solvent evaporated at 40 \u00b0C under \nvacuum. Product formation and purity were confirmed by TLC and NMR. A quantity of 3.89 g of \nproduct was formed.\n2.3. Activation of borosilicate supports\nSupport surfaces were borosilicate glass slides cut into rectangles of 0.7 x 0.7 cm. Surface \nactivation was achieved by the following steps: 10 min ultrasonication in water, 10 min \nultrasonication in 1 M NaOH, 10 min in water. Then, 10 min ultrasonication in 5 M HCl, 10 min \nultrasonication in water and 10 min ultrasonication in acetone. Finally surfaces were dried for 2 \nhours in an oven at 80\u00b0C.\n2.4. Derivatisation of borosilicate supports with silane living iniferter\nActivated borosilicate supports were functionalised by immersion for different times (from 1 to 12 \nhours) in a 2% v\/v solution of N,N-diethylaminodithiocarbamoylpropyl(trimethoxy)silane in \ntoluene. The supports were then washed in methanol and dried at room temperature. Derivatisation \nwas confirmed by static contact angle measurements.\n2.5. Analysis of silane modification by contact angle\nStatic contact angle (CA) measurements were performed on a Cam 100 optical Angle Meter (KSV \nInstruments Ltd., Finland). Measurements were repeated 4 times and the mean value calculated. \n2.6. Quantitative estimation of the level of silane modification on the supports\nIniferter-modified borosilicate slides and control slides (not derivatised with the iniferter) were \nplaced in a glass Petri dish filled with 20 ml of a 1% fluorescent monomer, 9-anthracenylmethyl \nacrylate in toluene, ultrasonicated for 10 min and purged with argon for 20 min. UV irradiation \n(Philipps UV lamp 9 W\/cm2) was carried out for 20 and 40 min. After the polymerisation, slides \nPage 8 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\nwere washed in methanol and dried. \n2.7. Polymer grafting\nFor the grafting, the iniferter-modified supports were placed in a covered Petri-dish and immersed\nin the polymerisation mixtures: (P3) 0.5g MAA, 4.5g EGDMA, 5g toluene; (P4) 0.46g 2-TFMAA, \n4.29g EGDMA, 5g toluene; (P5) 0.665g EGMP, 4.08g EGDMA, 5g toluene. After removal of \noxygen by purging with argon, the polymerisation was carried out for different times (0, 10, 20, \n40, 60, 80 min) using a Phillips UV lamp (9 W\/cm2), mounted at 8 cm distance from the surface. \nPolymer grafting was also performed with the addition of tetraethylthiuram disulphide (TED) at \nthe concentrations 0, 100 nM, 1 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M and 100 \u00b5M. Experiments were repeated in a modified \natmosphere, inside an Atmosbag continuously purged with nitrogen. The grafted supports were \nwashed with methanol, dried and analysed with contact angle (CA), AFM and FT-IR.\n2.8. Fluorescent analysis of the grafted layer\nThe fluorescent monomer 9-anthracenylmethyl acrylate in the concentrations 0, 0.031, 0.0625, \n0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1% was added to a solution containing 0.1 g MAA, 0.9 g EGDMA, in 1 g \ntoluene, sonicated for 10 min and then purged with argon for 20 min. The slides with the initiator \nattached to the surface were placed in covered Petri-dishes and immersed in the polymerisation \nmixtures. The covalent attachment occurred under UV light during 20 min. The surfaces were then \nwashed with methanol and dried under a stream of nitrogen.\nQuantification of the fluorescence of the surface was performed with a fluorescence analyser \nequipped with GeneSnap and GeneTool softwares (Syngene Europe, Cambridge, UK). Images \nwere captured at fixed readout wavelength (\uf06cexc 320nm, \uf06cem 410nm), 0.200s exposure, 20 RU \nradius. A calibration curve was plotted with the relative fluorescence units (RFU) and the quantity \nof monomer added to the mixtures. The equation for the calibration was linear, y (RFU) = 5.7865 x \n(\u00b5g of fluorescent monomer). The fluorescence readouts were converted into \u00b5g\/ area and into \nPage 9 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\nmol\/ area. \n2.9. FT-IR analysis of the grafting & AFM analysis\nFT-IR spectroscopy was used for the qualitative analysis of the grafted polymers. The equipment \nused was a Bruker IR-Scope-II (Bruker Optics, UK) equipped with attenuated total reflection \n(ATR) objective and controlled by Opus\/IR optic software. FT-IR spectra were collected in \nreflectance mode, in the range between 600 and 4000 cm-1, subtracted for the background. The \ndifferent preparation steps were analysed. AFM images were obtained in contact mode using the \nPicoScan\u2122 instrument (Molecular Imaging Corporation, Tempe, AZ, USA). Surface topography \nwas analysed by scanning regions of 10 x 10 \uf06dm2 and 1 x 1 \uf06dm2.\n2.10. Ellipsometry measurements\nA Beaglehole Instruments phase-modulated Picometer ellipsometer (He\u2212Ne laser, \u03bb = 632.8 nm) \nwas used to measure the thickness of dry layers of the grafted polymers.\nA refractive index of 1.48 was used for polymer layers. The ellipsometric angles \u03a8 and \u0394 were \nmeasured at angles of incidence ranging from 80\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 (measurements were made every 1.00 \ndegree), and fit using a Cauchy model (Igor Pro. software package) to obtain the thickness with an \naccuracy of \u00b1 1 nm. Thickness measurements were taken at five different points on every sample \nmeasured in ambient air.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Derivatisation of the supports with initerfer\nThe silane iniferter N,N-diethylaminodithiocarbamoylpropyl(trimethoxy)silane was synthesised\nwith a modified protocol adapted from Kobayashi et al. (1992) (Supplementary Material 1).\nAdvantages of the modified protocol are the ease of purification and high yield (76%) of product.\nSupport surfaces were modified with the silane-living iniferter after activation. The time course of \nPage 10 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\nthe modification was studied and optimised by static CA measurements. Bare silica has a CA of \n10-12\u00b0 that changed to ca. 80\u00b0 due to the modification. The changes in CA measured were plotted \nas percentage versus time, as reported in Figure 1. Results displayed a saturation course and were \nin line with the literature (Kobayashi et al. 1992). A period of 3 hours was considered satisfactory \nfor the derivatisation process.\nAn estimation of the quantity of iniferter groups placed on the supporting surface was attempted by \nusing fluorescence, in line with other quantitative fluorescence surface studies (Ivanov et al., 1996; \nXing at al., 2007). It was supposed that the activation of the iniferter groups in the presence of \nfluorescent monomers would result in labelling the majority of the iniferters, thus offering the \npossibility to estimate the quantity of active iniferters on the surface. The photo-activation was \nallowed to proceed for different times (20 and 40 min) on supports derivatised with silane iniferter \nand on controls. The results are summarised in Table 1 with batches showing variability in the \nrange 10-15%, possibly due to self aggregation of the fluorescent monomer as a source of error. \nData for 20 or 40 min photo-activation did not vary significantly, probably indicating that the \ngrafting of the layer of monomers onto the surface is a fast process that occurs within the first few \nminutes. Longer irradiation times resulted greater variability in the results, presumably due to other\nphenomena, such as self-polymerisation of the monomers in solution, or loss of iniferter groups at \nthe surface occurring, thus confusing the experimental picture. Upon ultrasonication the quantity \nof active iniferter groups attached to the surface dropped by 50% with respect to non-\nultrasonicated supports, suggesting that loosely attached monomers and iniferter are removed in \nthe process. The quantity of grafted iniferter groups was estimated as 20-30 pmol\/ mm2.\n3.2. Polymer grafting\nA layer of polymer was grown from the surface. The activation of the polymerisation process was \nby UV photodecomposition of the iniferter attached to the support. Ellipsometry measurements \nindicated that 20 min UV irradiation gave rise to ~ 5 nm polymer thickness, 40 min UV gave rise \nPage 11 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\nto ~ 6 nm polymer thickness. Time seemed scarcely relevant for determining the thickness of the \ngrafted layer and no variations were detected between the different monomer compositions tested. \nCA measurements were reported in Figure 2 A, showing an angle of about 68\u00b0 for the grafted \npolymer, which is in accordance with the literature data (Yuan et al., 2007). \nIn order to characterise the grafted layers, FT-IR spectra of the supports after each derivatisation \nstep were collected. Figure 2 B shows the spectra of the iniferter-modified support and of the \ngrafted polymers P3, P4 and P5. Iniferter-modified supports displayed a characteristic peak at 1650 \ncm-1 for the CS group and some peaks in the region around 1200 cm-1, attributed to thiocarbamyl \n(C=S) stretching (Fig. 2 B, a). As expected, the contribution of the dithiocarbamate iniferter, \nincluding the presence of CH3 and CH2 vibration is seen between 1100 and 1550 cm\n-1 (Han and \nWilliams, 1991).\nIn the case of polymers P3, P4 and P5, the wavenumber of the C=O stretching vibrations in the \nregion of 1900\u20131200 cm\u22121 is a function of the copolymer composition (Ruckert et al., 2002). The \nspectra showed the C=O stretching vibration, typical of the ester\/acid carbonyl groups, at \n\uf07e1732\/1710 cm\u22121 (Fig. 2 B, arrows, b). The asymmetric carboxylate stretching band \u03bdas(COO\u2212) is \nobserved near 1560 cm\u22121 (Fig. 2 B, c) (Colthup et al., 1975).\nPolymer P3 contained methacrylic acid with CH3 and CH2 groups giving stretching absorptions at \n2998 and 2954 cm\u22121 respectively. The deformation bands of these groups were observed at 1487 \nand 1452 cm\u22121. The C=O stretching around 1700 cm-1 was also observed. Polymer P4 contained \nthe trifluoromethyl acrylic monomer distinguished by the presence of intense signals at 1250 cm-1\n(Fig. 2 B, d). Polymer P5 contained the phosphate monomer, which gave an intense signal in the \nregion 1250-1350 cm-1 (Fig. 2 B, f). These results prove the different natures of the grafted \npolymers.\n3.3. Growing grafted polymers with controlled thickness\nThe goal of this work was to achieve control over the layer of cross-linked polymer grafted to the \nPage 12 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\nsurface. Producing a grafted polymer of a defined thickness has practical importance, e.g. in \nassuring the formation of an adequate number of binding sites, as in the case of polymer used in \nsensor development.\nThere are different factors responsible for polymer growth and therefore important for controlling \nthe process and extending the grafted layer of significant dimensions: (i) the amount of iniferter on \nthe surface (Lin, 2001), (ii) the reactivity of the monomer and the cross-linker (Ward et al., 2002), \n(iii) the stability of the radicals (Ward et al., 2002), (iv) the decrease of the polymerisation rate at \nthe surface due to diffusional and steric barriers (Blaya et al., 2004), (v) the presence and the \nincorporation of oxygen in the solution during the polymerisation, (vi) the equilibrium between \nactive\/dormant species (Mijangos et al., 2006). \nWe took into consideration the presence of oxygen and the equilibrium between active\/dormant \nradical species. Figure 4 indicated that an oxygen-free environment is essential for the growth of \nthe polymer. The thickness of P3 obtained from solutions simply purged with argon was 6 nm, \nwhile polymerisation in better-controlled atmosphere within an Atmosbag produced a coating of \n20 nm thickness. \nIn the second case, the equilibrium between active\/dormant radicals was shifted by the addition of \na chain terminating agent, tetraethyl thiuram disulphide (TED) (Otsu, 2000). The terminating agent \nTED was added to the monomer mixture at the concentration of 10 \u00b5M and polymerisation was \ncarried out for 80 min. Ellipsometry was used to determine the thickness of the grafted polymer\nlayer. Results shown in Figure 3 A indicated that P3 reached the significant thickness of ca. \n100 nm. It could be hypothesised that 10 \u00b5M of TED in the monomer solution would prevent the \nirreversible recombination of active radicals by providing an excess of dormant radicals, thus \nprolonging the life-time of the surface grafted macroiniferter. \nThe influence of the polymerisation time on polymer thickness was evaluated. Figure 3 B shows \nthat increased irradiation time corresponds with an increased thickness of the grafted polymer \nlayer. It was noted that 40 min polymerisation produced a thickness of about 70 nm, while 80 min \nPage 13 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\nproduced a 100 nm layer. The relationship between irradiation time and thickness of the grafted \nlayer was almost linear (equation: y(nm)=1.3857x(min of polymerisation); R2=0.8952), this \nobservation is in accordance with other surface macromolecular architectures prepared by \nphotochemical initiation (Nakayama and Matsuda, 1996) and accounts for a limited disruption of \nthe surface proximity to the chain elongation process. Further investigations were conducted to \ndetermine whether there was a correlation between the concentration of TED and the thickness of \nthe grafted polymer. Figure 4 shows the dependency of the grafted polymer thickness on the \nconcentration of the chain terminating agent, TED. The irradiation time was fixed at 40 min. A \ndirect correlation between the concentration of TED and thickness of polymer emerged, indicating \nthat manipulation of the quantity of TED in solution is an effective way to obtain grafted layers \nwith thicknesses between 5 and 130 nm. A plateau effect seemed to occur for high concentrations \nof TED. The data were supported by FT-IR and AFM studies.\n4. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the versatility of living initiators to prepare grafted layers was recently \ndemonstrated in the work on functionalised nanoparticles, including molecularly imprinted \npolymers (Ruckert et al., 2002). Subsequently, the possibility to polymerise consecutively different \nlayers, each one incorporating different properties as desired was also demonstrated (P\u00e9rez-Moral \nand Mayes, 2007). Control of polymerisation allows for the design of customised multiple-\nfunctionality layers, one on the top of the other and offers practical solutions for biosensors and \nbiomimetic applications on chips.\nIn order to understand and have control of the growth of cross-linked polymeric surfaces, our \nresearch covered the basic aspects of the production of polymer surfaces using living iniferter \nmediated polymerisation. Monitoring each preparation step and the polymerisation with FT-IR \nallowed a close control of the grafting process as the distinctive vibrational signals for iniferter and \nfor polymeric materials were identified. The grafting was directly dependent on the irradiation \nPage 14 of 25\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n14\ntime and on the concentration of chain terminating agent. The best conditions for grafting so far \nidentified were 40-60 minutes of irradiation and 10 to 100 \u00b5M of TED, which allowed the growth \nof a 100 nm thick polymer layer, while a 100nM TED concentration resulted in the formation of \n10 nm-thick polymer film. The process could in principle be extended to any composition of \npolymer desired, including MIPs. Such an approach would help to design ideal or highly \ncompatible recognition layers to be integrated within sensor systems, optimising electrical \nconductivity and reducing diffusion times for the analytes, thus enabling the preparation of a new \ngeneration of highly sensitive polymer-based sensors. In conclusion we have demonstrated an \nability to enhance control over the thicknesses of polymeric coating made of cross-linked \nmaterials.\nAcknowledgements\nAuthors thank EU-Marie Curie TOK-IAP NanoDAT project and Fondazione Cariverona.\nAppendix A.
