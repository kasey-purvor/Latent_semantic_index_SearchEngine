In other words, the unique identifier would be an intelligent number that would establish a relationship with other numbers, much in the same way that Dewey Decimal numbers provide specific information about the subject matter of published materials.     [Shepard] How much can you change a document before it is a different document?  Why do we never change an automobile\u2019s vehicle identification number?  Why do we talk of each human being as having a single Trustworthy 100-Year Digital Objects:     Preliminary Version Evidence Even after Every Witness is Dead    8 th May 2003 \u00a9  2003, H.M. Gladney identity from before birth until after she has decayed in the grave, even though we would not recognize the 60-year old from her baby picture?  Why do we have proper names for some entities, but not for most entities?  When do we decide that a name is not enough, and that adding an identifier is worthwhile? For business control, production of digital works may need to be traced.  Furthermore, scholars, archivists, and attorneys often want to study multiple editions of a work.  Dante\u2019s Inferno, for instance, has an existence beyond that of any particular edition of the work and transcends the existence of any printed instance held by a library.  The work itself, each edition and translation, and each print instance may merit unique identification. Having digital identifiers implies costs that are usually swept under \u201coverhead\u201d rugs.  The largest hidden costs are those incurred by end users waiting for slow network services or human administration and having to issue multiple queries when early results are unsatisfactory. [#11] An identifier should permit a reader to be confident which concept or resource needs to be known, understood, transmitted, edited, or otherwise manipulated.  Identifiers are references that provide indirection; any other use is intolerable if it interferes with this purpose.  For instance, syntactic rules for conveying classification must be regarded as secondary to whatever makes each identifier a robust reference. 7.1  Conventional and Unconventional Identifier Semantics","cites":null},{"id":9468943,"title":"Trusted Digital Repositories: Attributes and Responsibilities,","authors":[],"date":"2002","doi":null,"raw":"Neil Beagrie, Meg Bellinger, Robin Dale, Marianne Doerr, Margaret Hedstrom, Maggie Jones, Anne Kenney, Catherine Lupovici, Kelly Russell, Colin Webb, and Deborah Woodyard, Trusted Digital Repositories: Attributes and Responsibilities, RLG-OCLC Report, May 2002. http:\/\/www.rlg.org\/longterm\/repositories.pdf","cites":null},{"id":9468963,"title":"Trusted Systems,","authors":[],"date":"1997","doi":"10.1038\/scientificamerican0397-78","raw":"M.
