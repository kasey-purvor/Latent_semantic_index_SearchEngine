Commentators \npoint to long-term reductions in voting rates, declin-\ning levels of trust in politicians, and waning interest \nin civic affairs, and these phenomena are frequently \nseen as evidence of a broader crisis in democracy (e.g., \nPutnam 2000; Scheufele and Nisbet 2002; Gibson, \nNixon and Ward 2003; Galston 2004). These charac-\nteristics are generally seen to be most apparent among \nthe young: it is often asserted that young people are \nincreasingly apathetic and reluctant to exercise their \ncivic responsibilities. In this context, some have \nlooked to new media\u2014and particularly the Internet\u2014\nas a means of reengaging young people and thereby \nof revitalizing civic life. The Internet is seen to have \ngreater appeal and relevance for young people than \ndo \u201colder\u201d forms of civic participation and is seen to \nhave the potential for creating new, networked forms \nof communication and democratic political culture \n(Bennett 2003; Lenhart, Fallows, and Horrigan 2004; \nColeman 2005, 2008; Zukin et al. 2006; Kann  \net al. 2007). In addition to generating considerable \nenthusiasm among policymakers, these possibilities \nhave been addressed by growing numbers of research-\ners in recent years (e.g., Dahlgren 2007; Gerodimos \n2008; Loader 2007; Bachen et al. 2008; Bennett 2008; \nBennett, Wells, and Freelon 2009).\nWe set out to test these arguments with CivicWeb, \na three-year research project funded under the European \nCommission\u2019s Framework 6 program for targeted socio-\neconomic research. With CivicWeb we sought to analyze \nthe potential contribution of the Internet to promoting \ncivic engagement and participation among young  \nkeywords\n16 International Journal of Learning and Media \/ Volume 2 \/ Number 1\npeople (ages 15\u201325). The project took a broad view of \nthe Internet but focused on the range of youth-orient-\ned civic sites now emerging on the World Wide Web. \nThese sites are created by many organizations, interest \ngroups, and individuals, and they range from small-\nscale, local initiatives to national and international \nprojects.\nWe used both quantitative and qualitative meth-\nods and focused on three key dimensions of the new \nonline civic sphere:\n the nature and characteristics of such sites\u2014that is, \ntheir content and formal features (design, mode \nof address, structure) and the extent to which \nthey invite active participation from their users;\n the production of the sites, including the mo-\ntivations, working practices, and economic \nmodels of the producers; and\n the uses and interpretations made of such sites \nby different social groups of young people \nand the relationship between this online ac-\ntivity and their civic participation offline.\nIn framing our research, we adopted a deliberately \nbroad and open conception of \u201ccivic participation.\u201d \nThe kinds of sites and activities we examined include:\n initiatives on the part of government (includ-\ning the European Union) or political parties \n(e.g., via such parties\u2019 youth wings) to secure \ngreater civic participation;\n initiatives based on single-issue campaigns \n(e.g., around globalization, discrimination, \nopposition to hunting, and homelessness);\n more open forums in which young people \nfrom particular social groups (the disabled, \nrefugees, gays and lesbians) come together to \ndefine and debate their own agenda of issues;\n sites promoting social activity or participation \nbased on religious beliefs;\n sites encouraging volunteerism and social \nactivism;\n sites designed for specific ethnic minorities or \ngeographically isolated groups; and\n sites addressing areas that might be seen as \nproblematic, such as political violence or xe-\nnophobic hatred.\nPotentially, these sites and activities constitute a \npowerful form of nonformal learning: they can pro-\nmote the development of social capital and create new \nforms of political, social, and economic participation. \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nYet their effectiveness in doing so is likely to depend \non the offline social and political context in which \nthey are situated. Our research therefore explored the \ndifferent ways in which the civic potential of the In-\nternet varies across the different political cultures of \nseven European member states or applicant nations: \nHungary, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, \nTurkey, and the United Kingdom. The partner coun-\ntries represent different cultural and political histories, \ndifferent political systems, and different relationships \nwith the European Union. Our aim was to identify \nsome of the issues and dilemmas faced by practitioners \nand policymakers in relevant fields and to understand \nsome of the key characteristics of good practice. We \nalso sought to consider how information and com-\nmunication technologies\u2014and these civic sites in \nparticular\u2014might be used in the context of citizenship \neducation, not least in developing more participatory \nand self-actualizing approaches to civic learning.\nIn exploring this emerging phenomenon, several \nempirical questions needed to be addressed. Can the \nInternet in fact deliver on the promise of reengaging \nyoung people in the public sphere and of creating \nnew forms of political and civic culture among young \npeople? How far does participation online result in \ngreater participation offline in the field of civic cul-\nture? Are some kinds of young people (e.g., as defined \nin terms of social class, gender, ethnicity, religion, or \nculture) more likely to respond to such invitations \nthan others? Are some groups more likely to stay \nwithin more traditional forms of civic participation \nor to resist them altogether? What are the obstacles \nto such new media initiatives, and how can we dis-\ntinguish between good and bad practices in this field? \nHow well does the model of \u201cnetworked citizenship\u201d \ncorrespond to the everyday practices and motivations \nof the majority of young people? Do these virtual \nnetworks constitute new forms of civic participation \nin themselves? And how do these developments vary \nacross the different political cultures of European \nmember states? These are among the questions that \nCivicWeb sought to address.\nMethods\nOur approach involved several distinct but overlap-\nping forms of investigation that were described in a \nseries of reports as the research proceeded (see http:\/\/\nwww.civicweb.eu\/). We began by reviewing existing \nresearch and considering the different ways in which \nkeywords\nBanaji and Buckingham \/ young People, the Internet, and Civic Participation 17\nour key questions and concepts had been addressed \nacross the different participating countries. We found \nthat the terminology being used in this debate is not \nconsistent or transparent: words like civic, political, \ncitizenship, democracy, and engagement can mean quite \ndifferent things in different contexts.\nBearing in mind the inherently slippery nature of \nthese terms, we set out to map the range of civic web-\nsites available for young people in the seven countries. \nLike the early reports produced in the United States \nby Kathryn Montgomery and her colleagues (2004), \nour study at this point was largely descriptive, involv-\ning the selection and classification of approximately \n50 civic\/political websites and 30 youth-specific sites \nin each country, for a total of 560 sites. These were \ncategorized in terms of their topic, stated purpose and \naims, use of applications, layout, interactivity, network \nfeatures, and mode of address, as well as their peda-\ngogic and ideological outlook. While the analysis here \nwas primarily qualitative, it did include some quantita-\ntive aspects\u2014for example, in relation to the numbers \nof interactive applications or the proportion of calls for \nonline versus offline participation.\nWe then developed in-depth case studies of a range \nof civic websites (six to eight in each country), looking \nfurther at the interconnections between pedagogy, de-\nsign, mode of address, ideological stance, and the aims \nof the site in the context of specific national historical \nand social circumstances. Case studies from different \ncountries were then compared under the following cat-\negories: party political sites; European-wide youth sites; \nyouth activist sites; general (adult and youth) activist \nsites; sites promoting civic participation more broadly; \nsites promoting volunteering; youth council sites; sites \naddressing specific identities (minority, regional, na-\ntional); and youth counseling sites.\nOverlapping with the survey of websites and \nthe case studies was a series of in-depth interviews \nwith the producers of civic websites in each partner \ncountry (n 5 85). Here, too, we attempted to sample \nproducers from a range of organizations and contexts, \nfrom national and local governmental bodies and \nlarge NGOs through to grass-roots youth activists. \nOur aim was to gain an understanding of how the \nproducers view their sites; why they have a website, \nwhat its purpose is, and how it links to offline activi-\nties; how they came to decisions about their site\u2019s \ndesign; how they perceive their site\u2019s audience and\/or \nparticipants; and how they conceptualize the inter-\nlinked civic and political spheres.\nIn considering the users (or potential users) of \nthese sites, we set out to provide a broad survey \nalongside in-depth qualitative analysis. We conducted \nan online questionnaire with over 3,300 participants \nin the seven participating countries. The survey pro-\nvided basic quantitative data about young people\u2019s \nuses of the Internet and the extent to which they \nwere engaging in civic activities both online and offline. \nThis was followed by a series of in-depth focus group \ninterviews with young people: 10\u201312 such groups \nwere convened in each country, covering a range of \ndemographic groups and involving young people \nwho were civically active and inactive, Internet-savvy \nand Internet-excluded, as well as educationally disad-\nvantaged or socially excluded. These groups enabled \nus to explore the young people\u2019s Internet practices \nwithin different sociocultural contexts, their motiva-\ntions for political and\/or civic engagement and how \nthe Internet helped them to pursue their interests in \nthese areas, their responses to civic content online, \nand the role of civic and\/or political education.\nReports from each of these investigations are \navailable online, and specific case studies or aspects of \nthe research are reported in some of the other articles \nin this issue of IJLM. Our aim in the present article \nis to provide an overview of some of the key themes \nthat have emerged from the project and to raise \nbroader critical questions. In doing so, we seek to \nillustrate some of the relationships and interconnec-\ntions\u2014but also some of the contradictions and fault \nlines\u2014between the different elements of the study \nand the extent to which these reflect broader histori-\ncal and national trends in civic and political partici-\npation among young people.\nToward empowerment?\nIn general, our research supports the view that young \npeople are mostly alienated, or at least disconnected, \nfrom traditional forms of politics and civic participa-\ntion. Most of the focus group respondents across all \nour national samples said they saw politicians as cor-\nrupt, boring, or hard to understand; working only for \ntheir own interests; and far removed from the everyday \nneeds and realities of common citizens. A large propor-\ntion of respondents felt that things needed to change, \nand they spoke, often at length, about such issues as \ninequality; corruption; lack of housing and job op-\nportunities; high prices; religious, ethnic, or regional \ndiscrimination; police harassment of civil protest; and \nkeywords\n18 International Journal of Learning and Media \/ Volume 2 \/ Number 1\ngovernment censorship of the media. Respondents \ngenerally felt that they themselves were unable to \nchange these things. This perceived lack of efficacy was \noften related to their general feelings about the unre-\nsponsiveness, untrustworthiness, and distance of  \npoliticians. However, the feeling also derived from re-\nspondents\u2019 actual experiences of having participated \n(e.g., in school councils, e-petitions, or demonstra-\ntions) and of not having been listened to or not \nmanaging to change anything. In some instances, \ntheir feeling also related to fears about how active \nparticipation or political critique might impact them \nas individuals and make them targets of the state, the \npolice, or aggressive citizens with opposing views.\nFor many of the Web producers we interviewed, \nthis perceived lack of efficacy was the central prob-\nlem. The rhetoric of \u201cyouth empowerment\u201d and \n\u201cyouth voice\u201d was particularly prominent here. These \ndiscourses typically see young people as lacking a \nvoice, or at least the skills to make their voices heard: \nwhen they are given a voice online, the argument \ngoes, they will be empowered to express their own \nconcerns in a safe environment, and this empower-\nment can then be transferred offline to provide them \nwith greater control of their own lives. While some \nproducers saw this as a more-or-less spontaneous \nconsequence of gaining access to technology, many \nworking within activist and\/or charitable organiza-\ntions felt that young people should have more oppor-\ntunities and training to help them develop the skills \nnecessary for making their voices heard in the public \nsphere. Ironically, however, many of these producers \nwere aware that their users tended to be mostly those \nyouth who were already engaged or skilled in civic \nparticipation. The challenge for all concerned was to \nfind ways of reaching \u201chard to reach\u201d and disadvan-\ntaged young people, those most at risk of exclusion \nfrom civil society and politics. The Internet has, thus \nfar, not been found to be a particularly good means of \ndoing this, and traditional offline approaches involv-\ning youth workers and local youth groups are still the \nmain points of contact for economically and socially \ndisadvantaged young people.\nThese perceptions were reinforced by the findings \nof our research with young people. Unsurprisingly, we \nfound that social factors such as class, ethnicity, age, \nand religion significantly affected the ways in which \nyoung people approached and used the Internet. In our \nsurvey, the interest in civic and political websites ap-\npeared to be stronger among older respondents  \n(19- to 25-year-olds rather than 15- to 18-year-olds), those \nnot living with their parents, youth who identified as \nreligious, and girls and young women. This contradicts \nsome commonly held perceptions\u2014for instance, that \ngirls and young women are less motivated to participate \npolitically than are boys and young men. However, \nthe factor showing the clearest patterns in relation to \nInternet use and civic participation across most of the \ncountries was that of socioeconomic class. We found \nevidence of a continuing digital divide along socioeco-\nnomic lines, both in the quality and extent of access to \ntechnology and in the extent of civic engagement.\nThe Internet appeared to be an important tool for \nyoung people who were already engaged in civic or \npolitical activities offline. In focus groups with young \npeople who were active in global or local political, \nreligious, or identity-based groups, the Internet was \nconsistently presented as a major hub for political \nactivities. This appeared to be the case for groups as \ndiverse as political parties\u2019 youth organizations, vari-\nous kinds of established activist networks, and com-\nmunities of civic interest. The Internet was also an \nimportant resource for minorities\u2014political, sexual, \nethnic, regional, or religious\u2014and, in some notable \ninstances, seemed to offer young people from such \ncommunities a space to question and enact identity, \nto question notions of tradition, to discuss the mean-\ning of culture and citizenship, or to debate methods \nof participation and protest (see Szak\u00e1cs and Bogn\u00e1r \n2010 in this issue of IJLM).\nHowever, the content and loci of the discussions \nthat do take place online should not be homogenized. \nThe respondents to our survey were overwhelmingly \ninterested in websites on entertainment and lifestyle \nissues: only a small proportion (around 10 percent) \nreported having visited civic or political sites. This \ndoes not necessarily mean that they have not partici-\npated in civic discussions online, however, because \nevidence suggests that such discussions (between \npeople of all ages) may be found in the forums of \nentertainment and social networking sites of various \nkinds. Furthermore, not all young people who are \ncivically active offline participate in such discussions \nonline, and the ones who do participate online may \ndo so only sporadically.\nUsing the Internet\nThe Internet seems to be regarded by a number of \ncivic and political organizations as an inexpensive \nkeywords\nBanaji and Buckingham \/ young People, the Internet, and Civic Participation 19\nand effective method of disseminating information \nand making contact with young people. However, \nour research suggests that this strategy is by no means \nalways inexpensive or as effective as offline mobiliza-\ntion. Several producers pointed out that for a site to \nbe known, considerable thought must be given to \nmarketing and publicity. Most civic website produc-\ners have neither the time nor the money to publicize \ntheir sites adequately, and hence the core of users \nremains relatively small. Indeed, a majority of the \nwebsites surveyed across the project functioned with \na combination of one or two part-time paid employ-\nees and several volunteer staff. Some sites went for \nmonths without being updated because initial grants \nfunded only the building of the site and not its main-\ntenance, which is crucial to success. We found high \nturnover rates among volunteer staff at the real or \nvirtual offices of many of the civic websites surveyed, \nand turnover sometimes led to the closure of a site. \nThe sites themselves thus have a high attrition rate, \nand the picture for any one site can change rapidly \nfrom one year to the next.\nDespite the availability of more-or-less interac-\ntive applications such as blogs, wikis, message boards, \nforums, video uploading, podcasts, and so on, static \nwebsites composed primarily of written text and a \nfew visual images still appear to be the norm. Of ten \ninteractive applications we chose to look for, most \nyouth civic websites in our larger survey offered only \nan average of 2.5 (and most commonly these included \nphotographic content and embedded YouTube videos). \nThe possibility for young people to post their own \ncontent or to question content on the sites was rare. \nHowever, the issue of interactivity on youth civic sites \nis not straightforward. Some funders appear to think \nthat complex and more expensive sites are always and \nautomatically better than their simpler counterparts. \nHowever, our interviews with producers and with \nyoung people suggest this is by no means always the \ncase. Offering interactive facilities does not automati-\ncally mean that young people will participate. We \nfound several instances of websites that have forums, \nuser content upload facilities, and message boards on \ngeneral themes (relating to European or more global is-\nsues) that were underused or full of spam.\nClaims about the Internet being a completely safe \nand equal space for participation were also challenged \nby a number of responses from both producers and \nusers of civic websites. Several producers were aware \nthat dealing with controversial issues of social justice \ncould provoke strong and negative responses from \nsome members of the public. Some young people \ndescribed being \u201cattacked\u201d online, a phenomenon \nthat was particularly apparent with sites concerned \nwith sexuality and, in the case of Sweden, gender. \nIn the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, young \nfirst- and second-generation immigrants are forming \ncivic organizations online to challenge prejudice both \nwithin and outside their communities. Many of these \nimmigrants are subjected to fierce and sometimes rac-\nist online critique and flaming, often by organized \nright-wing groups. In Hungary, Roma sites attempt to \navoid this situation by having closed membership or \nby censoring posts from racist users (see Szak\u00e1cs and \nBogn\u00e1r 2010).\nForums, user-generated content, and other inter-\nactive applications have to be carefully explained, \nencouraged, motivated, and managed. Young people \nare sometimes as intimidated by what they view as a \n\u201crequirement\u201d to contribute original content as they \nare disappointed by the lack of possibilities for com-\nmenting or interacting online. Specialized jargon has \nto be avoided or explained. The skills for using appli-\ncations such as RSS feeds, videocasts, or podcasts have \nto be taught rather than being taken for granted. This \nrequires planning, time, and money for personnel\u2014\nresources that most of the youth civic organizations \nsurveyed simply do not have. Several of the producers \nwe interviewed felt that a clear, helpful, but static site \nthat allowed youth to email the organization was bet-\nter than offering potentially off-putting or even dam-\naging opportunities for \u201cinteraction.\u201d\nYet paradoxes remain, as Fabbro\u2019s (2010) study in \nthis issue of IJLM suggests. Although most producers \nstill see the importance of promoting their organiza-\ntion or activities through traditional media channels \n(TV, newspapers, radio), a sizable minority of produc-\ners view the Internet as a challenge to the gate-keep-\ning of old media and say their users come to their \nsites for an alternative and more open perspective. \nHowever, this view needs to be balanced against the \nexperiences of a number of young people and find-\nings from our survey of sites, which suggest that a \nlarge number of civic websites for youth still maintain \na strong gate-keeping function, albeit sometimes with \ndifferent agendas (e.g., quality control, safeguarding \nusers) and with a more diverse set of content produc-\ners than mainstream media.\nOur research suggests that producers of political \nand civic websites need to give much more thought to \nkeywords\n20 International Journal of Learning and Media \/ Volume 2 \/ Number 1\nhow they spend their money. Significant amounts of \nfunding are sometimes allocated to website design\u2014 \nand especially to interactive features\u2014without a clear \nconception of their function. While such features \nmight make the organization look good, a large and \ncomplex site is not necessarily better for users. As some \nof the young people in our research suggested, it is \nimportant that sites are \u201cfit to purpose.\u201d This means \nlooking beyond the latest gimmicks and beyond some \npolitically correct sense that an organization lives or \ndies by its website.\nMotivating Civic and Political Participation\nWe found few cases in our interviews of attractive \nwebsite design or the latest interactive features moti-\nvating civic engagement and participation in them-\nselves. This counters a familiar and entrenched view \nthat by amusing and entertaining young people (on \nthe Internet and elsewhere) one can attract their  \nattention and encourage them to become engaged in \ncivic initiatives. The most significant characteristic of \nthe civic and political engagement we found among \nthe focus groups, as discussed by Gerodimos (2008, \n2009) and by Miegel and Olsson (2010) in this issue \nof IJLM, is that it tends to focus predominantly on \nissues of immediate proximity for the participants. \nIndividual and group identities, a sense of discrimina-\ntion, and\/or current life situation are key.\nThus, civic and political interests are related, in a \nnumber of cases, to having a family and\/or close com-\nmunity of relatives or friends interested in the same \nissues and concerns. In a number of cases, local civic \nachievements\u2014such as the experiences of group soli-\ndarity and of being active together and the feeling of \nhaving organized an event or campaign and received \nsome positive feedback from peers or older adults\u2014\nseem to generate a sense of efficacy that encourages \nand motivates further participation (whether online \nor offline). On the other hand, the results of offline \nactive citizenship were frequently called into doubt \nby young people who had experienced governments\u2019 \nfailure to respond\u2014for example, when they had dem-\nonstrated in large numbers against university tuition \nfees and for better housing provision, or against the \nwar in Iraq. Although such seemingly \u201cunsuccessful\u201d \nprotests might sap the motivation to participate, for \nsome the resulting anger led to further participation. \nIn most of our focus groups, when young people \nwere involved in civic activities that were related to \ntheir immediate contexts (both on- and offline), they \nseemed to feel more confident in their capacity to \nbring about change.\nWithout a \u201clive\u201d issue or social and political con-\ntext for young people to engage with, even the best- \ndesigned and best-funded sites are likely to remain  \nunderutilized. However, from young people\u2019s per-\nspectives, civic participation appears to be most \nsuccessful when it is both peer-to-peer and enables \nopportunities for reciprocal engagement with those \nin power (Coleman 2008). Most youth civic organi-\nzations tend to offer one or the other, and when en-\ngagement with politicians is offered it is most often \nnot reciprocal. This can be seen as a disincentive for \nyoung people to engage with formal politics online. \nAs one young woman in our focus groups asked, \n\u201cWhy should we speak if no-one is listening?\u201d\nA majority of civic website producers in our sam-\nple did not see the Internet civic sphere as a replace-\nment for offline civic and political actions but as a \ncomplement to them. For many, engagement still be-\ngins and ends offline. The Internet sustains and con-\ntributes to such engagement. The notion that online \ncivic action and offline civic action reside in separate \nrealms with separate participants was much debated \nbut ultimately was regarded by many as untenable. \nMany of the producers we interviewed were at pains \nto explicitly connect online and offline politics and \ncivic action, suggesting that they were never quite \ncertain about the status of actions that took place \nsolely online.\nNevertheless, signing online petitions or forward-\ning letters to big corporations\u2014termed \u201cone-click \nactivism\u201d by one producer and \u201cfeel-good activism\u201d \nby another\u2014are not necessarily seen to be the be-all \nand end-all of the things that young people are mo-\ntivated to do online. Most civic producers view the \ninformation gathering necessary for making up one\u2019s \nmind about a particular cause or the meeting up, dis-\ncussion, and protest offline as being supported and \nenhanced rather than replaced by the online actions \noffered in polls or forums. This is confirmed by focus \ngroup discussions with young people who connected \ntheir offline and online participation and did not see \nthe Internet as an entirely separate sphere but as feed-\ning into offline organizations in the areas of formal \npolitics, music, environmentalism, or other cam-\npaigning. As this implies, offline civic-based or politi-\ncally sympathetic friendship and comradeship can be \nstrengthened and complemented online.\nkeywords\nBanaji and Buckingham \/ young People, the Internet, and Civic Participation 21\nUnderstanding Context\nInevitably for a cross-national study, we identified \nissues that were particularly acute or took on differ-\nent forms at particular historical moments in differ-\nent countries. For example, the sphere of politics is \ngenerally seen as dirty and corrupt in both Hungary \nand Slovenia, where respondents showed a clear \npredisposition toward detaching civic organizations \nfrom politics. This means that voting is not generally \nencouraged by youth civic sites in these countries and \nthat even party sites attempt to steer clear of connec-\ntions with politics.\nCrucially for those interested in European civic \nidentity (see Tuzzi, Padovani, and Nesti 2007), the no-\ntion of European citizenship and belonging is viewed \nin hugely different ways by young people in, for \ninstance, Turkey, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom, \nwhere civic websites addressing European youth is-\nsues, travel, and integration are found more or less \nappealing. In the United Kingdom, for example, find-\nings from focus groups with young people suggest \nthat European identity is not at all valued or highly \ndeveloped, except among a small minority of politi-\ncally left-wing and antiauthoritarian youth who see \nit as a positive identity that supersedes the national \none, which is seen as retrograde. In Slovenia, on the \ncontrary, our research found some degree of posi-\ntive feeling toward the idea of European citizenship \namong a wider range of youth. Most focus group \nparticipants displayed either a lack of knowledge of \nEuropean politics or a sense of distrust about them. \nMany interviewees also seemed to lose any sense of \nmotivation and affiliation toward politics and the \ncivic sphere (which we could sometimes sense at the \nnational levels and which was even clearer at the \nlocal and regional levels) when discussing Europe.\nMost of the civic or political participation and \nengagement\u2014sustained engagement in particular\u2014\ndescribed and identified across the focus groups \nappeared to begin and end offline in real communi-\nties or communities of interest and identity, even \nif the Internet explicitly provided a space, tool, or \nfocal point for aspects of this engagement. Some \ncivic sites may be set up as a short-term solution to a \nproblem rather than being integrated into other ac-\ntivities\u2014for instance, to prevent the demolition of \na skate park or to inform young people about their \nvoting rights. Such sites are often not heavily used \nover an extended period of time and are thus unlike \nthose sites that have more diffuse motivations, such \nas gathering together a community of young people \nwho are linked by common bonds. Websites formed \nby \u201cspecialist\u201d groups (based on religious, cultural \nor subcultural identity, or locality) for highly spe-\ncific audiences among young people and produced \nby members of that specific group (particularly by \nyoung members of the group) tend to support a \nstronger sense of belonging and community and \nare more likely to be used by members of the target \ngroup.\nNew Politics online?\nAlthough these points might seem to suggest that the \nforms of politics taking place online include nothing \nnew, the evidence shows that, to the contrary, civic \nwebsites for young people are tapping into newer \nforms of civic and political participation. This is most \napparent in the case of so-called ethical consump-\ntion or socially conscious shopping, which plays on \nthe Internet\u2019s qualities as a medium of shopping and \nmarketing par excellence (see Hirzalla and Van Zoonen \n2010 in this issue of IJLM). Questions remain, however, \nabout whether and how such activities are linked to \ntraditional or more activist forms of political participa-\ntion (Banaji and Buckingham 2009). We have found \nfurther interesting exceptions where the Internet \ndoes seem to make a clear difference to individuals or \ngroups of young people in terms of engagement with \nthe wider, interlinked civic and political spheres. For \nexample, in a number of our partner countries the \nInternet was used by groups of young people as an al-\nternative to mainstream media, as a means of accessing \nperspectives and information not found in traditional \npress or broadcasting. How this relates to action is still \nan open question, but the significance of having a freer \nflow of information and a less rigid hierarchy dictating \nwho can express and broadcast political ideas online \nshould not be downplayed. In countries where the au-\nthorities have begun to censor and regulate the online \nsphere\u2014such as Turkey\u2014the loss of this freedom high-\nlights its importance still further.\nWe have also found evidence that the Internet \ncan enable young people to take on and refine their \nrole as monitorial citizens\u2014for instance, by tracking \nelections; keeping abreast of privacy issues; discuss-\ning, photographing, and publicizing police behavior; \ndebating civil liberties; and getting behind the scenes \nin conflict situations. As highlighted by Miegel and  \nkeywords\n22 International Journal of Learning and Media \/ Volume 2 \/ Number 1\nOlsson (2010), in special cases such as file-sharing and \nthe free downloading of music, the Internet itself can \nbe the focus of and reason for civic action. Young  \npeople who take part in such civic actions are not  \nalways from among those already or necessarily active \nin civic or political campaigns offline.\nConclusion: Future Challenges\nCivicWeb was designed in the age of what is now \ncommonly known as Web 1.0\u2014with a general idea \nof the World Wide Web as a matter of individual or \nlinked sites that would be put up largely by organiza-\ntions, often with considerable funding behind them, \nalmost as a kind of advertising for the work they were \ndoing. To a large extent, this can be seen to reflect an \nold \u201cmass media\u201d model. The work of Montgomery \nand her team (2004) describing youth civic organiza-\ntions online in the United States accorded with this \napproach, as did previous work on political young \npeople using civic websites in Sweden (Olsson 2007) \nand the United Kingdom (Gerodimos 2008). In the \ninterim, however, networks that are more interactive \nand \u201csocial\u201d have emerged on the Web. Although we \nought to be skeptical of the overly optimistic view \nof the possibilities of so-called Web 2.0, instant mes-\nsaging and social networking sites like MySpace and \nFacebook, as well as wikis and other kinds of \u201csocial \nsoftware,\u201d do represent a significant shift and offer \ndifferent possibilities for participation in particular.\nEven so, these new developments raise difficult \nmethodological issues for future research. How do we \nbest find instances of civic activity in the breadth and \ndepth of MySpace or Facebook, for example? What \nwould a sample consist of, and how might it be iden-\ntified? CivicWeb addressed some of these issues, but \nonly in the context of material put up by more-or-less \nformal or already-constituted social\/political groups. \nTrying to track civic and political participation in \ndomains like Facebook is increasingly important but \nalso hugely complex.\nThis leads to a second issue that has continued \nto trouble us throughout our project: the meaning of \ncivic and its relation to seemingly cognate terms such \nas political or social. As we found, the word civic does \nnot simply translate across national contexts. Some \nlanguages have no obvious parallel term. Even in the lit-\nerature in English, the criteria for defining what counts \nas \u201ccivic\u201d vary widely. In some cases, the word appears \nto be a synonym (or even a euphemism) for politics. \nIn others, it seems to be something prepolitical, a kind \nof engagement that is about collective rather than in-\ndividual identifications\u2014albeit ones that are not yet \narticulated in political or adversarial terms. In yet other \ncases, civic seems to be much more nebulous or expan-\nsive: volunteering to help the elderly or picking up litter \nin the street becomes civic, and these activities in turn \nconstitute what many people think of as being a \u201cgood \ncitizen.\u201d Is the discursive meaning of civic the same as \ncivil (as in \u201ccivil society\u201d), with which it shares an ety-\nmology, or is civic more affiliated with citizenship (which \nitself has several competing definitions nested in several \ndifferent rhetorical and political traditions)? In seek-\ning to define civic, commentators often seem to make \nrecourse to the notion of \u201ccommon good\u201d\u2014but who \ndefines the common good, and who is excluded when \nwe define civic in this way (Banaji 2008)?\nThese questions have raised some serious meth-\nodological dilemmas\u2014for example, about what to \ninclude or exclude from the samples of websites and \ngroups being researched for CivicWeb. Should we \ninclude Christian or Muslim sites as civic sites? Many \nthings that go on in religious communities and hence \non religious sites might be called \u201ccivic.\u201d What of ex-\ntreme right-wing sites: much of the rhetoric on these \nsites involves claims to be on the side of civic virtue \nand the common good (with the common good being \ndefined in terms of ethnic and national purity). These \nsites also invite participation, and regulation on them \nis often similar to that encountered on more main-\nstream sites. Can such sites be termed \u201ccivic\u201d?\nPushing this question further, we have found it \nnecessary to ask what counts as civic participation. \nMany kinds of social participation exist, and some \nforms of participation that young people engage in are \nnot recognized by adults, while other forms are posi-\ntively denigrated or seen as threatening (Westheimer \nand Kahne 2004). So, do we count, for example, \nso-called ethical consumption as civic participation \n(Scammell 2000; Banaji and Buckingham 2009)? Is \nsigning an online petition or responding to someone \non a message board civic participation? Is smashing \nthe windscreen of an SUV or setting fire to a vivisec-\ntion lab civic participation? To push this argument to \nits limit, can terrorism in the interest of particular po-\nlitical causes constitute a form of civic participation?\nBehind this is the danger that\u2014far from encourag-\ning civic participation\u2014some online activity becomes a \nsubstitute for it. Thus, the argument runs, brief and epi-\nsodic participation via email petitions, Facebook profiles, \nkeywords\nBanaji and Buckingham \/ young People, the Internet, and Civic Participation 23\nor message boards allows us to feel good about having \ndone something, even to feel \u201cempowered,\u201d but does \nsuch \u201cparticipation\u201d make much difference to the world? \nYoung people are repeatedly encouraged to \u201chave their \nsay,\u201d but our project has found little evidence that people \nin positions of power are listening in a systematic and  \nrespectful manner\u2014or, if they are, that they are doing \nanything in response. The superficial appearance of par-\nticipation can easily justify recourse to a kind of cynicism.\nFinally, there is a danger of assuming that partici-\npation is always a good thing in itself\u2014that it is nec-\nessarily better than nonparticipation and that young \npeople are somehow at fault if they choose not to \nparticipate (see Coleman 2005, 2008). If we consider \nsome of the more confrontational and abusive ways \npeople interact online, or some of the forms of offline \nparticipation that such behavior may lead to (such as \nracist violence), can we really be so sure that participa-\ntion is always a good thing (Banaji 2008)? While we \nshould avoid a wholesale relativism, avoiding norma-\ntive assumptions about what responsible young people \nshould be doing seems critically important. In the aca-\ndemic and policy literature in this area\u2014and indeed \non the websites themselves\u2014we find a dominant con-\nception of what young people should be doing that is \nnot so different from the conceptions that dominated \ndebates about offline participation in a pre-Internet \nage. We find implicit rules about good behavior, im-\nplicit constructions of identity, a favoring of certain \nkinds of responsible or \u201cpro-social\u201d orientations\u2014all of \nwhich are embedded in the designs of websites, in how \nyoung people are addressed, in the kinds of (limited) \nparticipation that are invited, and in the way actual \nparticipation on the sites is moderated. Additionally, \nin particular national contexts across our project we \nfound further disavowals\u2014for instance of religion or \npolitics\u2014or specific affiliations that need to be made \nto support particular national civic identities. The \nproblem with this normative view is that certain kinds \nof activity do not get recognized as civic, or as in any \nway valuable; more particularly, certain people\u2019s modes \nof expression\u2014the styles of participation that are pre-\nferred by particular social groups\u2014tend to be ignored \nor marginalized (Gerodimos 2009).\nOur research shows that although the Internet is an \nexcellent tool at the disposal of those already interested \nin politics, it is much less effective in reaching out to \nand engaging those who are not already engaged. This \nis partly because of the nature of the medium and partly \nbecause those who are less likely to be engaged are also \nthose who are less likely to enjoy good access to the  \nmedium\u2014and although that is changing, Internet provi-\nsion is still largely governed by the logic of the market, \nwhich is primarily to target those who are already well \nserved (Warschauer 2003; Fairlie 2006). Likewise, most \ncivic sites are addressed to those who are already engaged, \nas is apparent in their implicit assumptions about what \nprospective visitors know, what they are likely to be inter-\nested in, and what is likely to motivate them. Casual  \nvisitors\u2014and, perhaps, less well-educated, less middle-\nclass visitors\u2014are far less likely to be addressed or drawn \nin. The rhetoric of the websites in question is self-con-\nfirming, a matter of preaching to the converted. Thus, \nthe Internet might actually reinforce particular forms of \nexclusion; it might become a forum where young people \nare invited to participate, but only if they follow rules set \nby those already in power and only if they behave ac-\ncording to certain middle-class norms of responsibility \nand good manners. And this is an invitation that some \nyoung people may well decide to refuse.\nIn light of this, the fundamental question that \ninformed our research\u2014and that has informed the \nwider debate in this area\u2014ought to be rephrased. The \nquestion is not so much \u201cCan the Internet reengage \nyoung people or enable them to participate when \nthey were not participating before?\u201d Rather, the ques-\ntion is \u201cHow might the Internet engage with other \nmovements within society, or how might those other \nmovements use technology, to bring about change?\u201d \nThe question thus becomes not about technology but \nabout social and cultural processes.\nAcknowledgments\nThe research discussed in this article (and in the other \narticles in this issue of IJLM) was made possible by \nfunding from the European Commission under the \nFramework 6 program.
