INTRODUCTION \nRecent findings in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) \nindicate that learners contribute differently to discourse (Caspi, Chajut, \nSaporta, & Beyth-Marom, 2006; De Laat & Lally, 2003; H\u00e4kkinen & J\u00e4rvel\u00e4, \n2006). For example, Caspi, Gosky and Chajut (2003) analysed a total of \n \n* Based upon: \nRienties, B., Tempelaar, D. T., Van den Bossche, P., Gijselaers, W. H., & Segers, M. (2009). The \nrole of academic motivation in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning. Computers in \nHuman Behavior, 25(6), 1195-1206. \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014759 \n7706 messages of 47 courses at various faculties of the Open University in \nIsrael and found that the majority (80%) of students contributed only a small \namount (20%) of messages. But not only differences in the amount of \ncontributions by students have been found. For example, De Laat and Lally \n(2003) showed that students in an online E-learning Master\u2019s programme \nalso differed with respect to the type (cognitive, affective, metacognitive) of \ncontributions. In a Bachelor\u2019s freshman course of educational science, \nSchellens and Valcke (2005) found significant differences with respect to \nboth amount and type (social, cognitive) of discourse.  \nAlthough recent research findings indicate that learners differ with \nrespect to the amount and type of discourse contributed, little is known \nabout what the causes of these differences are. Within the field of \nComputer-Supported Collaborative Learning, researchers try to understand \nwhat the underlying reasons for a lack of contributions to cognitive \ndiscourse are and how to solve them. For example, Lowry and colleagues \n(2006) found that informatics learners who in an experimental design \ncollaborated in class and were complemented with ICT established higher \nlevels of communication quality than learners who collaborated only \nvirtually. Hurme and colleagues (2007) analysed the interaction patterns \namong secondary school children who worked online in pairs on \nmathematical problems. Metacognitive activity varied among participants, \nwhich subsequently influenced the interaction among pairs of learners. \nFurthermore, by using Social Network Analysis some pairs became central \ncontributors to discourse, while others were less active and were positioned \non the outer fringe of the social network (Hurme et al., 2007). \nRecently several researchers have investigated the role of motivation in \nCSCL. For example, by measuring goal-oriented motivation (Pintrich & De \nGroot, 1990), Yang and colleagues (2006) found evidence that motivation is \npositively related with how learners perceive each other\u2019s presence in \nonline courses. J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 and colleagues (2008) found that students who \nwere working together in groups of 3-5 students reported more (favourable) \nlearning goals and fewer performance goals in the face-to-face setting than \nstudents in virtual groups. Besides goal-oriented motivation, several other \nfactors might influence motivation like the degree of self-determination of \nlearners (Ryan & Deci, 2000a, 2000b). For example, in an online setting \nlearners have a large autonomous freedom and can decide their own \nlearning path, which might be beneficial for learners with intrinsic motivation \n(Ryan & Deci, 2000b; Vallerand & Bissonnette, 1992). In addition, the \nlimited role of the teacher in a distance learning constellation (Kirschner, \nStrijbos, Kreijns, & Beers, 2004; Vonderwell, 2003) refrains the teacher to \ninteract in a similar manner as in a face-to-face setting. A teacher can \ndirectly provide instruction, feedback and coaching in a face-to-face setting, \nwhich should help learners who are in need for external regulation (Roth, \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 60 \nAssor, Kanat-Maymon, & Kaplan, 2007). In an online setting, the lack of \nregulation might limit the responses from extrinsically motivated learners.  \nThe research presented here looks into the effects of differences in \nacademic motivation (i.e. intrinsic\/extrinsic\/a-motivation) of learners on their \ncontribution to discourse. Although recently an increasing number of \nresearchers have analysed the role of motivation in CSCL settings in a \nqualitative manner, to our knowledge no quantitative study exists that \nanalyses how differently motivated learners behave in an online learning \nenvironment. Therefore, we will investigate to what extent differences in \nindividual contributions to discourse are explained by differences in \nacademic motivation. As recommended by recent research (De Laat, Lally, \nLipponen, & Simons, 2007; De Wever, Schellens, Valcke, & Van Keer, \n2006), we will use a multi-method approach composed of Content Analysis, \nwhich measures the type of discourse activity, and Social Network Analysis, \nwhich measures the interaction processes among learners. Afterwards, we \nwill integrate the type of contributions to discourse with the position of each \nindividual learner in the social network and finally link this to his\/her type of \nmotivation. In this way, we attempt to assess to what extent differently \nmotivated learners vary in the type of discourse contributed in online \nsettings. \n2. IMPORTANCE OF MOTIVATION FOR LEARNING \nMotivation has an important influence on a learner\u2019s attitude and learning \nbehaviour (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Fairchild, Jeanne Horst, Finney, & Barron, \n2005; Ryan & Deci, 2000a; Vallerand et al., 1992). \u201cMotivation has been a \ncentral and perennial issue in the field of psychology, for it is at the core of \nbiological, cognitive and social regulation\u201d (Ryan & Deci, 2000b, p. 69). As \nmotivation is a multidimensional and multilevel construct (Boekaerts, 1997), \na wide variety of definitions and instruments are discussed and used in \neducational psychology research. We adopt the concept of motivation \ndeveloped by Deci and Ryan (1985), where \u201c[t]o be motivated means to be \nmoved to do something\u201d, as the degree of self-determination of learners \nmight explain why some learners contribute more to discourse in CSCL \nthan others. According to Ryan and Deci (2000a, 2000b), most theories of \nmotivation regard motivation as a unitary phenomenon, implying that a \nlearner has either a lot or little motivation, also referred to as motivation \nversus a-motivation. To be motivated means to be moved to do something, \nwhile a-motivation is a state of lacking any intention to act (Ryan & Deci, \n2000a). However, focusing only on the level of motivation ignores the \nunderlying attitudes and goals the learner has in order to pursue an action \nor goal (Deci & Ryan, 1985). In Self-Determination Theory (SDT), Ryan and \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014761 \nDeci (2000a, 2000b) distinguish between intrinsic motivation, extrinsic \nmotivation and a-motivation. \nIn intrinsically motivated learning, the drive to learn is derived from the \nsatisfaction and pleasure of the activity of learning itself; no external \nrewards come in play. According to Ryan and Deci (2000a, p. 56), intrinsic \nmotivation is \u201c\u2026 a critical element in cognitive, social, and physical \ndevelopment because it is through acting on one\u2019s inherent interests that \none grows in knowledge and skills\u201d. In a subtheory of SDT, Cognitive \nEvaluation Theory (CET), social and environmental factors play an \nimportant role in determining what facilitates and what hinders intrinsic \nmotivation. More specific, in SDT feelings of competence and social \nrelatedness in combination with a sense of autonomy (defined as basic \npsychological needs) are important facilitators for intrinsic motivation to \noccur, to maintain and to enhance.  \n Externally motivated learning refers to learning that is a means to an end, \nand not engaged for its own sake. In contrast to classical theories of \nmotivation that regard extrinsic motivation as a single construct, SDT \nproposes that extrinsic motivation is a construct with different facets that \nvary greatly with the degree to which the learner is autonomous (Deci & \nRyan, 1985; Ryan & Deci, 2000a). That is, besides intrinsic motivation and \na-motivation, SDT distinguishes four different forms of extrinsic motivation \nthat constitute a motivational continuum reflecting an increasing degree of \nself-determined behaviour, namely external regulation, introjection, \nidentification and integration (Ryan & Deci, 2000a).  \nAs most educational learning settings are externally regulated, a crucial \nquestion is how to internalise and to integrate educational activities for \nlearners (Deci & Ryan, 1985). \u201cInternalisation is the process to taking in a \nvalue or regulation, and integration is the process by which individuals more \nfully transform the regulation into their own so that it will emanate from their \nsense of self\u201d (Ryan & Deci, 2000a, p. 60). When learners internalise their \nreasons for showing a given behaviour, learners become more self-\ndetermined (Legault, Green-Demers, & Pelletier, 2006). Three factors in \nSDT enhance the internalisation of regulation, namely relatedness, \nperceived competence and autonomy (Deci & Ryan, 1985). The more a \nlearner perceives a sense of belonging and connectivity to other learners \n(relatedness), the more willing learners are to show the behaviours that are \nexternally regulated (Legault et al., 2006). In addition, a learner can only \nadopt an extrinsic goal when the learner feels he or she is competent to \nachieve this goal. Finally, in order to fully internalise a regulation, a learner \nmust autonomously value its meaning and worth (Ryan & Deci, 2000a). \nIn a long series of over 700 studies in classroom settings, the model of \nDeci and Ryan (1985) has been empirically verified (Ryan & Deci, 2000a, \n2000b). For example, more autonomous extrinsic motivation has been \nfound to lead to greater engagement, less dropping out (Legault et al., \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 62 \n2006), higher quality learning and greater psychological well-being (Ratelle, \nGuay, Vallerand, Larose, & Sen\u00e9cal, 2007; Ryan & Deci, 2000a). Greater \ninternalisation yields more behavioural effectiveness as well as greater \nexperienced well-being (Ryan & Deci, 2000a). \nVallerand and colleagues have added further theoretical concepts to the \nmodel of Deci and Ryan (1985) by acknowledging that the attitudes, values \nand goals that trigger a learner to become intrinsically motivated can differ \nwhen a learner enters into college or university and voluntarily chooses a \nstudy. For example, some students might choose to study economics as \nthey enjoy learning a new science, some might choose economics in order \nto understand the underlying reasons of an economic crisis, while others \nmight choose economics as playing a manager in a virtual game during a \nmanagement course seems exciting. Therefore, Vallerand et al. (1992) \ndistinguish between three intrinsic motivation types: intrinsic motivation to \nknow or learning for the satisfaction and pleasure to understand something \nnew; intrinsic motivation to accomplish or learning for experiencing \nsatisfaction and pleasure to accomplish something; and intrinsic motivation \nto experience stimulation or learning to experience stimulating sensations.  \n2.1 Role of motivation in CSCL \nSeveral researchers have found that learning in CSCL settings is more \ncomplex than in face-to-face settings. For example, Schellens and Valcke \n(2005) found that educational psychologists who worked together online in \ngroups of ten contribute mainly lower level cognitive discourse. J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 et \nal. (2008) found that learners who collaborated online produced less \n(favourable) learning goals and more performance goals than learners who \ncollaborated in a face-to-face setting. Bromme et al. (2005, p. 5) argue that \nmeaning barriers that obstruct the mutual construction of meaning of \ninformation from sender to receiver might hinder effective communication \namong learners in CSCL settings. For example, the intention of one learner \nposting a message in a discussion-board might be interpreted differently by \nanother learner due to a lack of context, body-language or writing-style. \nThis might reduce the connectivity and sense of belonging (relatedness) of \na learner as well as reduce the perceived competences due to the occurring \nmiscommunications, which in turn might reduce social interaction. \nAccording to Williams et al. (2006), working and learning online can be a \nlonely and frustrating experience, in particular when the social interaction is \nlimited.  \nTai (2008) argues that strong motivation is a prerequisite for online \nlearning. Yang et al. (2006) found that the way learners experience and \nperceive social interaction depends on social presence of peers (i.e. ability \nof peers to express themselves socially and emotionally in the group) as \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014763 \nwell as written communication skills. If social interaction is difficult to \nachieve and maintain in online learning settings, this might have a negative \nimpact on the motivation of learners. In an extreme case, a learner might \nbecome amotivated due to the meaning barriers, lack of relatedness and \nlack of perceived competence and will therefore refrain from contributing to \nsocial interaction (Legault et al., 2006; Ratelle et al., 2007). \nRecent research in face-to-face settings by Roth, Assor, Kanat-Maymon \nand Kaplan (2007) and Legault et al. (2006) indicates that the teacher has a \nstrong influence on the type of motivation of students. In online settings, the \nrole of the teacher seems to be more complex (De Laat et al., 2007; \nVonderwell, 2003), whereby providing accurate and timely instruction and \nfeedback is notoriously difficult due to barriers in space and time (Bromme \net al., 2005; De Wever et al., 2006). The limited role of teacher might \nhamper learners who are triggered mainly by external regulation as the \nteacher can only provide immediate instruction and feedback when both \nteacher and student are online simultaneously. At the same time, two \npotentially opposite effects might occur for intrinsically motivated students. \nAs teacher regulation is limited, this may leave more room for self-directed \nlearning, which is assumed by SDT to be beneficial for intrinsic motivation \n(Roth et al., 2007). In contrast, the lack of timely positive feedback might \nhamper intrinsic motivation to be sustained during the entire duration of a \ncourse (Ryan & Deci, 2000b).  \nThree recent studies have analysed the role of motivation in the context \nof CSCL. Yang et al. (2006) conducted a survey among 250 respondents of \neleven online educational psychology courses and found that goal-oriented \nmotivation measured by the Motivated Strategies for Learning \nQuestionnaire (MSLQ) of Pintrich & De Groot (1990) positively influences \nsocial presence among peers, that is the perception that emotions can be \nshared using CSCL. Although the finding that motivation influences \nperceived social presence among peers is important, the lack of \nmeasurement of actual learning processes and learning outcomes and lack \nof control of 51% non-response requires further research. Therefore, \nVeermans and Lallimo (2007) used a cluster analysis on eight scales \n(collaborative learning, interest in learning and technology, controls of \nlearning beliefs and self-efficacy) in an online class of 50 psychology \nstudents and conducted a content analysis of discourse activity of three \nstudents, each from one of the three identified cluster profiles. The student \nwith the combined highest values on the eight scales produced messages \nthat had more variety of categories within each message, which according \nto Veermans and Lallimo (2007) is a necessity for genuine knowledge \nbuilding.  \nTo capture how motivation influences the learning process, J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 et al. \n(2008) have analysed how motivation in collaborative learning settings \nchanged over time (again) using MSLQ (Pintrich & De Groot, 1990). \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 64 \nEducational psychology students in groups of 3-5 worked together on three \ncollaborative learning tasks in either face-to-face or virtual settings. \nStudents in the face-to-face setting reported more (favourable) learning \ngoals and less performance goals relative to students in virtual settings. \nAfterwards, J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 et al. (2008) described the relation with motivation and \nbehaviour for two face-to-face groups. Although the two studies of J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 \net al. (2008) and Veermans and Lallimo (2007) provide important insights in \nhow motivation influences behaviour of learners in CSCL using a qualitative \nperspective, a quantitative analysis to assess the role of motivation on \nbehaviour of learners in CSCL might increase our understanding why some \nlearners contribute more actively to discourse than others. In addition, by \nusing self-determined motivation rather than goal-oriented motivation, a \ndifferent perspective on the role of motivation in CSCL is taken.  \n \nIn this article, we try to unravel the complex dynamics of contributions to \ndiscourse in online settings. As some learners are more active than others \nto contribute to discourse, we need to understand why contributions to \ndiscourse and interaction patterns among learners vary. Furthermore, we \nneed to distinguish contributions made by learners solely in cognitive \ndiscourse communication, as task-related communication has been found \nto be positively related to individual knowledge acquisition (Schellens & \nValcke, 2005; Weinberger & Fischer, 2006). Therefore, recent research (De \nLaat et al., 2007; Hurme et al., 2007) has suggested that using a \ncombination of content analysis (type of discourse) with Social Network \nAnalysis (position of learner relative to others) leads to a clearer \nunderstanding of interaction patterns in CSCL. Social Network Analysis \n(SNA) can be considered as a wide-ranging strategy to explore social \nstructures to uncover the existence of social positions of individuals within \nthe network (Aviv, Erlich, Ravid, & Geva, 2003). In SNA, one can determine \nthe position of a learner within a group relative to other learners. Network \ncentrality, that is the degree to which a learner has a central position in the \nsocial network, and ego-density, that is the number of other learners a \nlearner is connected with also called neighbourhood size, are core-\nconcepts within SNA (Hurme et al., 2007; Wassermann & Faust, 1994). For \nexample, in a group of 21 students in a graduate online course genetics \nregression analysis revealed that network centrality among students who \nworked in collaborative groups was a robust predictor of cognitive learning \noutcomes (Russo & Koesten, 2005). Hurme et al. (2007) found that the \nneighbourhood size was positively related with the number of contributions \nfrom and to others.  \nIn particular when SNA is combined with other instruments, SNA \nprovides an powerful instrument to measure dynamics of learning \nprocesses (De Laat et al., 2007; Martinez, Dimitriadis, Rubia, Gomez, & de \nla Fuente, 2003). For example, Martinez et al. (2003) found that by using \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014765 \nlog data of users and SNA the dominant central role of the teacher in \ndiscussion forums could be identified. De Laat et al. (2007) measured the \ncentrality of learners at three distinct phases using SNA in combination with \nCA, which was afterwards used to as primary input for a critical event recall \nby the teachers. In this way, the teachers were able to link their own \nbehaviour to the dynamics of the learning processes of the group. Although \nDe Laat et al. (2007) and Hurme et al. (2007) used both Content Analysis \n(CA) and SNA, they only qualitatively link the methods together. To our \nknowledge not a single study has (quantitatively) integrated the results of \nCA into SNA. Our integrated approach distinguishes the various interaction \npatterns among learners based upon the type of discourse by combining \nthe type of discourse contributed by a learner (e.g. learner 1 has \ncontributed ten messages, of which six that were task-related and four were \nnon-task related) with his\/her position relative to others in the social \nnetwork (e.g. learner 1 has two connections to learner 2 and 5 who also \ncontributed to task-related discourse and three connections to learner 2, 6 \nand 8 who contributed to non-task related discourse). As a learner can \nbecome a central contributor to discourse because of having actively \nparticipated in non-task related contributions rather than task-related \ndiscourse, distinguishing the type of discourse when using SNA will further \nimprove our understandings of the complex dynamics of discourse within \nCSCL. Furthermore, by distinguishing the type of task-related discourse \ncontributed by a learner (Schellens & Valcke, 2005; Veerman & Veldhuis-\nDiermanse, 2001), our integrated approach allows us to distinguish the \nposition of learners within the social network based upon their contributions \nto cognitive discourse. Schellens and Valcke (2005) argue that learners \nwho contribute mainly to reporting facts or own opinions are primarily \ncontributing to lower cognitive discourse. Learners who mainly contribute to \ntheoretical ideas, elaborate on argumentation of others, or evaluate the \nargumentations put forward by others are contributing to higher cognitive \ndiscourse.   \n2.2 Research questions \nWe expect that learners who are highly intrinsically motivated to learn \ncontribute more actively to (cognitive) discourse than learners who are low \non intrinsic motivation and who may require additional teacher support to \nparticipate at levels comparable to intrinsically motivated learners. As a \nresult, learners high on intrinsic motivation will take a more central position \nrelative to other learners, in particular when looking at the (higher) cognitive \ndiscourse. In contrast, highly extrinsically motivated learners are expected \nto contribute less to (cognitive) discourse and will be positioned on the \nouter fringe of the network. Therefore, we will investigate the following three \nresearch questions: \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 66 \nx To what extent do differently motivated students show different non-\ntask related and task- related discourse activity? \nx To what extent are differently motivated students different in the \ndegree of centrality in the social network? \nx To what extent are differently motivated students different in the \ndegree of centrality in the (higher) cognitive discourse network?  \n3. METHODOLOGY AND RESEARCH DESIGN \n3.1 Setting \nThe present study took place in an online summer course for prospective \nbachelor students of an International Business degree programme in the \nNetherlands. The aim of this course was to bridge the gap in economics \nprior knowledge for students starting a bachelor (Rienties, Tempelaar, \nWaterval, Rehm, & Gijselaers, 2006). The online course was given over a \nperiod of six weeks in which students were assumed to work for 10-15 \nhours per week. The participants never met face-to-face before or during \nthe course and had to learn using the virtual learning environment \u201con-the-\nfly\u201d. The course was based upon principles of Problem-based learning \n(PBL), which is an educational method that fosters socio-constructivist \nlearning. PBL focuses student learning on complex situations and on a \nvariety of realistic information (Dochy, Segers, Van den Bossche, & Gijbels, \n2003; Van den Bossche, Gijselaers, Segers, & Kirschner, 2006). One of the \nkey issues in PBL is that students are actively constructing knowledge \ntogether in collaborative groups (Hmelo-Silver, 2004). Students participated \nin groups within a collaborative learning environment using discussion \nforums and announcement boards. Within six weeks, students had to \ncollaborate together on solving six tasks through a problem-based learning \nmethod. The group, together with the tutor, could decide upon the pace in \nwhich content and context were dealt with. No obligatory meetings were \nscheduled. At the end of each week, the tutor made a suggestion on how to \nproceed with the next task, thereby focusing on process rather than on \ncontent. The results of three interim-tests and a final summative test \ncombined with graded participation in the discussion forums were used to \nmake a pass-fail decision. Students who passed the course received a \ncertificate. Hence, this setting provides a unique opportunity to assess the \nrole of motivation on behaviour of learners in virtual settings as the learners \nnever met each other before and collaborated exclusively in the virtual \nlearning environment.  \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014767 \n3.2 Participants \nIn total 100 participants were randomly assigned in six groups. Data were \nanalysed for those individuals who actually posted at least once a reaction \nin the discussion forum. This resulted in a total of 82 participants that were \nselected for analysis. The six groups had an average of 13.66 members \n(SD= 2.16, range = 11-17) per team. The average age was 19 years and \n45% of the learners were female. \n3.3 Instruments \n3.3.1 Individual contribution to discourse using Content Analysis \nAccording to two reviews of CSCL-literature (De Wever et al., 2006; \nRourke, Anderson, Garrison, & Archer, 2001), most researchers use \nContent Analysis (CA) schemes to analyse discourse in CSCL. The aim of \ncontent analysis techniques is to reveal evidence about learning and \nknowledge construction from online discussions. Content analysis for \nevaluating discourse activities was based on the instrument of Veerman \nand Veldhuis-Diermanse (2001) that has been used and validated by other \nresearchers (e.g. Schellens & Valcke, 2005). When comparing various \ncontent analysis schemes, Schellens and Valcke (2005) conclude that the \nVeerman and Veldhuis-Diermanse (2001) scheme is particularly suited for \nanalysing knowledge construction among novice students. Veerman and \nVeldhuis-Diermanse (2001) make a distinction between non-task related (1 \nplanning; 2 technical; 3 social; 4 non-sense) and task-related discourse \nactivity (5 facts; 6 experience\/opinion; 7 theoretical ideas; 8 explication; 9 \nevaluation). Examples of each of the nine discourse activities are provided \nin Appendix A. Three independent coders (two economists, one educational \npsychologist) were trained to use the CA instrument and independently \ncoded all messages. A random sample of 100 messages was used as a \ntest case but the Cronbach alpha was rather low (0.6). Therefore, an \nadditional meeting with the three coders was established and the diverging \nresults were discussed and consensus on the method was arranged. The \ncoding took 80-100 hours per coder, who received a financial compensation \nin return.  \nAs a unit of analysis, the complete message was chosen, unless the \ncoders considered a message to consist of multiple elements. The \nmessage was split when two or more coders thought that a message \nconsisted of multiple elements (see two examples in Appendix B), which \noccurred for 42 messages. In addition, a message was \u201ccodeable\u201d when \ntwo or more coders used the same category. When a message was \n\u201cuncodeable\u201d, the message was removed from the analysis (see two \nexamples in Appendix C). Students posted 2307 messages of which 2075 \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 68 \nwere considered as codeable (90%). The Cronbach alpha (\u012e) for these \n2075 messages was 0.928. Most studies have set the minimum \u012e at 0.7 \nand recommend setting \u012e > 0.8. The Cohen\u2019s kappa of the coder inter-\nreliability (coders agreeing with each other) between Coder 1 \u2013 2, 2 \u2013 3 and \n1 \u2013 3 was 0.71, 0.71 and 0.68 respectively and Fleiss\u2019 kappa of the three \ncoders is 0.66. De Wever et al. (2006) argue that Cohen\u2019s kappa values \nbetween 0.4 and 0.75 represent fair to good agreement beyond chance, \nwhile the Fleiss\u2019 kappa indicates substantial agreement among the coders \n(Lombard, Snyder-Duch, & Campanella Bracken, 2002). \n3.3.2 Positioning of individuals within social network using Social \nNetwork Analysis  \nWhile Content Analysis methods are frequently used in CSCL, focusing \non content analysis alone, without taking into consideration interaction \nprocesses, restricts our understanding of learning processes in online \nsettings (De Laat et al., 2007; Hurme et al., 2007). While Weinberger & \nFischer (2006) solved (part of) this problem by using four separate CA \nmeasures for participation, epistemic dimension, argument dimension and \nsocial modes of dimension, the \u201capplication of the framework is still a \nchallenge due to the enormous work load of analysing discourse corpora on \nmultiple dimensions\u2026\u201d (Weinberger & Fischer, 2006, p. 90). To avoid this, \nwe integrated the results of the content analysis into our Social Network \nAnalysis (SNA) in order to measure participation, argumentation and social \ninteraction patterns (De Laat et al., 2007; Hurme et al., 2007; Wassermann \n& Faust, 1994).  \nSocial Network Analysis provides us with several tools to analyse \ninteraction patterns among individual learners. Two frequently used \nmeasures were employed in order to determine the position of individuals in \nthe overall, task-related, and higher cognitive social structures, namely \ncentrality and ego network density. First, Freeman\u2019s degree of Centrality \n(Freeman, 2000; Wassermann & Faust, 1994) measures whether learners \nwere central in the social network or not. If a learner contributed actively to \ndiscourse and most other learners responded to the activities of this \nlearner, he\/she became a central learner in the network and therefore had a \nhigh degree of centrality (Reply Degree). Afterwards, all communication \nidentified by CA as facts, experience, theoretical ideas, explication and \nevaluation was integrated in the SNA in order to measure the degree of \ncentrality of only task-related communication (Reply TR Degree). In this \nway, we were able to distinguish contributions made by learners solely in \ntask-related communication, as task-related communication has been found \nto be positively related to individual knowledge acquisition (Schellens & \nValcke, 2005; Weinberger & Fischer, 2006). Finally, the degree of centrality \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014769 \nwith communication restricted to only higher cognitive discourse (Reply HC \nDegree) was measured, which implies communication labelled by CA as \ntheoretical ideas, explication or evaluation. By building upon theoretical \nideas, elaborating on argumentations of others and finally evaluating the \narguments raised, learners construct their own mental model about \ncomplex problems (Alexander, 2006; Schellens & Valcke, 2005; \nWeinberger & Fischer, 2006). Second, the ego network density of each \nindividual within the network (Size) was used, which measures to how \nmany other learners a learner is directly connected. As with the centrality \nmeasures, we also included a separate measure for task-related discourse \n(TR Size) and higher cognitive discourse (HC Size). \n3.3.3 Individual motivation \nIndividual motivation was measured by the Academic Motivation Scale \n(AMS), which was developed by Vallerand et al. (1992) for \ncollege\/university students and measures the contextual motivation for \neducation. The instrument consists of 28 items, to which students respond \nto the question stem \u201cWhy are you going to college?\u201d. There are seven \nsubscales on the AMS, of which three belong to intrinsic motivation scale, \nthree to extrinsic motivation scale and one for a-motivation. Intrinsic \nmotivation subscales are intrinsic motivation to know (IMTK): learning for \nthe satisfaction and pleasure to understand something new; intrinsic \nmotivation to accomplish (IMTA): learning for experiencing satisfaction and \npleasure to accomplish something; and intrinsic motivation to experience \nstimulation (IMES): learning to experience stimulating sensations. The \nthree extrinsic motivation subscales are identified regulation (EMID), \nintrojected regulation (EMIN), and external regulation (EMER). The three \nconstitute a motivational continuum reflecting the degree of self-determined \nbehaviour, ranging from identified regulation as the component most \nadjacent to intrinsic motivation, to externally regulated learning, where \nlearning is steered through external means, such as rewards. The last \nscale, a-motivation (AMOT), constitutes the very extreme of the continuum: \nthe absence of regulation, either externally directed or internally. The \nreliability and validity of the AMS scale has been established in a variety of \nstudies (Cokley, Bernard, Cunningham, & Motoike, 2001; Fairchild et al., \n2005; Vallerand & Bissonnette, 1992; Vallerand & Pelletier, 1993; Vallerand \net al., 1992). The temporal stability of the AMS construct was confirmed by \nVallerand and Bissonnette (1992) and Vallerand and Pelletier (1993) with a \nmean test-retest correlation of .75 and .79 respectively. In addition, the \nstability of the AMS-instrument after one year (mean test-retest correlation) \nwas .68 and .29 after five years (Guay, Mageau, & Vallerand, 2003). In \nother words, the AMS instrument measures a relatively stable construct of \nmotivation towards education amongst college and university students.  \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 70 \nThe AMS questionnaire was distributed one month after the end of the \nsummer course in the regular bachelor programme. The learners were \nasked to fill in the AMS-questionnaire without taking into consideration a \nparticular course. The response-rate on AMS-questionnaire was 93% and \nthe Cronbach alpha for the seven items ranged from .760 to .856, which is \nin line with previous studies (Fairchild et al., 2005; Legault et al., 2006; \nVallerand et al., 1992). \n3.4 Analysis \nWe used a methodology of an integrated multi-method approach to \nidentify the effects of differences in academic motivation on the type of \ndiscourse as well as on the position of the learner in the social network. \nData were gathered on the individual level as well by means of the relative \nposition of each learner within the overall network using UCINET version \n6.158. Afterwards, the results of the content analysis were integrated into \nthe Social Network Analysis, whereby we further distinguished the task-\nrelated discourse network (cat. 5-9) and the higher cognitive discourse \nnetwork (cat. 7-9). The interrelationships between all measures were \nassessed through correlation and MANOVA analyses using SPSS 15.0.1. \n4. RESULTS \n4.1 Individual contributions to discourse \nOn average, the learners contributed 25.64 (SD= 28.07) messages and \nthere are substantial differences amongst individuals with respect to the \namount of discourse as assessed by a Chi-Square test (\u01d22 (df= 81 N=82) \n2258.17, p < .001). In addition, if we distinguish between task- and non-task \nrelated discourse, again significant differences are found (see Table 4.1). If \nwe look beyond mean values and take into account standard deviation, \nSkewness and Kurtosis values, we find strong variation in discourse \nactivities. Standard deviations are in all content analysis categories larger \nthan their mean values. In addition, the Skewness in all content analysis \ncategories are positive and around two or higher, implying a distribution \nwith a right-hand tail. Also the Kurtosis values indicate that observations are \nclustered more and have longer positive tails than the normal distribution, \nwith the exception of the number of ties to others (Size, TR Size, HC Size). \nStandard errors in Skewness (.267) and Kurtosis (.529) are smaller than \ntwo, which implies that normality conditions still satisfy. If we look into the \ndifferent categories that are discerned by Veerman and Veldhuis-\n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014771 \nDiermanse (2001), we find evidence of differences in individual \ncontributions to knowledge construction with the exception of categories 3 \n(social) and 9 (evaluation).  \nThe distribution of the degree of centrality of our social network indicators \nfollows a similar pattern as those of content analysis, although the tail is \nslightly shorter. When discourse becomes more (higher) cognitive, the \nnumber of central contributors decreases. With respect to the number of \nconnections (Size) each individual learner has, the differences amongst \nindividuals are significant except for higher cognitive discourse (HC Size). \nThe number of learners that a learner is connected to decreases as we \nmove to (higher) cognitive discourse. In sum, we find large differences \namong individuals with respect to the amount and type of discourse as well \nas significant differences among individuals with respect to their position in \nthe social network. \n \nTable 4.1 Contributions to discourse and integrated Social Network position \n  M SD Skewness Kurtosis Chi-square \nContent Analysis      \nNon-task related 12.88 15.04 2.77 10.68 1404.63 \nPlanning (Cat. 1) 1.37 2.03 2.09 4.53 75.33 \nTechnical (Cat. 2) 1.11 2.12 2.42 6.27 58.22 \nSocial (Cat. 3) 0.84 1.55 2.51 7.06 38.62 \nNonsense (Cat. 4) 9.53 11.39 3.31 15.58 1065.93 \n      \nTask-related 12.77 14.94 2.50 8.25 1037.74 \nFacts (Cat. 5) 4.63 5.57 2.36 7.96 355.95 \nExperience (Cat. 6) 1.28 2.18 2.52 6.81 88.75 \nTheoretical Ideas (Cat. 7) 2.04 2.74 1.91 4.33 101.90 \nExplication (Cat. 8) 4.58 5.89 2.29 6.40 376.84 \nEvaluation (Cat. 9) 0.22 0.50 2.23 4.33 2.00 \n      \nSocial Network Analysis      \nReply Degree 26.26 24.30 1.35 1.46 1772.73 \nReply TR Degree 13.36 13.49 1.60 2.72 755.52 \nReply HC Degree 6.82 7.53 1.58 2.56 402.60 \nSize 6.44 4.03 0.08 -0.97 159.46 \nTR Size 3.73 3.03 0.63 -0.34 113.11 \nHC Size 2.38 2.34 0.88 0.08 74.77 \nn = 82 \nTR = Task-Related communition (Content Analysis cat.5-9) \nHC = Higher Cognitive communition (Content Analysis cat.7-9) \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 72 \nTo illustrate the power of SNA in understanding the interaction of \ncontributions of individuals, the social network of all discourse activity \n(Figure 4.1) as well as only higher cognitive discourse (Figure 4.2) of the \nvirtual team with the highest average posts per learner (M=40.41, \nSD=35.04) is presentedi. Four aspects can be distinguished from these \nfigures. First of all, the social networks illustrate to whom a learner is \ncommunicating with and what the direction of communication is (Freeman, \n2000). For example, in Figure 4.1, Tutor 4 replied to a comment of Irine, \nwhich is indicated by the direction of the arrow (Wassermann & Faust, \n1994). In addition, John and Catherina have a so-called \u201creciprocal link\u201d \nwhen looking at all discourse activities, as they reacted both to each other\u2019s \ncontribution and the arrow goes in both directions. However, John and \nCatherina do not have any direct link when looking at higher cognitive \ndiscourse in Figure 4.2.  \nSecond, some individuals within the network are more central than others \n(Russo & Koesten, 2005; Wassermann & Faust, 1994). For example, \nAndre, Mark, Rick, Brigit and Judith are central members in the overall \nnetwork, while Rick, Maria and Tiffany are central in the higher cognitive \nnetwork. In other words, not every learner who is central in the overall \nnetwork (e.g. Andre, Judith) is also central in the higher cognitive network. \nOther learners who are not central in the overall network might become \ncentral contributors to higher cognitive discourse (e.g. Maria and Tiffany). \nHence, by integrating CA with SNA, we are able to distinguish dynamic \ninteraction patterns among learners based upon the type of discourse.  \nThird, some learners are on the outer fringe of the network and are not \nwell-connected. For example, Don, Sandra and Irine are connected with \nless than four ties in the overall network, while they are not taking part in \nthe higher cognitive discourse network.  \nFinally, there are some learners who are connected with most learners \nbut who are still on the outer fringe. For example, Joe, John, Jonathan and \nBrenda have more than 15 contributions but are still on the outer fringe of \nthe overall network. This means that despite the fact that their ego-density \n(i.e. number of links to others) is large, they do not occupy a central position \nin the network as the average number of contributions in this team was 40 \ncontributions. In the other five teams similar patterns are found, although \nthe number of messages is lower.  \nIn sum, individuals differ with respect to the number of ties as well as with \nrespect to the position in the network, which has also been found in other \nresearch (De Laat et al., 2007; Russo & Koesten, 2005). An innovative \nfeature is that by combining the results of the Social network analysis and \nthe content analysis, we are able to distinguish dynamic interaction patterns \nat different levels of discourse. \n \n  \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014773 \nFigure 4.1 Social Network of all discourse activity \n \nFigure 4.2 Social Network of higher cognitive discourse \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 74 \n4.2 Relating students\u2019 motivations and contributions \nTable 4.2 contains correlations between our selected learning indicators \nof content analysis with the seven motivations scales from the AMS \ninstrument. Focussing first on correlations between the several content \nanalysis categories scores and the scores for the three types of intrinsic \nmotivation, it is evident that being highly intrinsically motivated positively \ncorrelates with discourse activity in all categories: all correlations are \npositive. However, the strongest contribution of being highly intrinsically \nmotivated is in the categories of task-related discourse: correlations in this \ncategory are generally higher in value than correlations with non-task \nrelated discourse. In order to assess whether the type of motivation has an \ninfluence on non-task related as well as task-related discourse, a MANOVA \nanalysis was used. However, a one-way MANOVA results in an \ninsignificant effect (Lambda (2, 72) = 1.560, p > .10). Although the \ncoefficient of non-task related discourse is positive, it is not significant at \n5% confidence interval. For the aggregate category of all task-related \nactivities, correlations with all three intrinsic motivation scales are moderate \nin size and statistically significant at the 5% confidence level (IMTK r=0.27; \nIMTA r=0.24; IMES r=0.23, with p < .05). In other words, students high on \nintrinsic motivation contribute actively to all types of discourse, but most \nstrongly in task-related discourse. Within the categories of non-task related \ndiscourse, highly intrinsically motivated students have an above-average \ninterest in organisational matters, like planning (IMTA r=0.24; IMES r=0.24, \np < .05) and technical issues (IMES r=0.26, p < .05). \n Within the task-related issues, highly intrinsically motivated learners \nexcel most in contributing own experiences, theoretical ideas and \nexplications. The highest correlations are found for experience (IMTK \nr=0.29; IMTA r=0.28; IMES r=0.28, p < .05). The category \u2018new theoretical \nideas\u2019 is positively related to intrinsic motivation (IMTA r=0.23; IMES r=0.26, \np < .05). Finally, a positive correlation with explication has been found for \ntwo of the three types of intrinsic motivation (IMTK r=0.26; IMTA r=0.25, p < \n.05). A MANOVA, with three sub-groups of students based on median-splits \nof intrinsic and extrinsic motivation scores, rendering high-high, high-low \nand low-high scoring sub-groups, confirms the results and a significant \neffect (Lambda (2, 69) = 2.783, p < .05) was found. Follow-up univariate \nANOVAs indicated that learners high on intrinsic motivation did not \ncontribute more theoretical ideas (F (2, 69) = 3.096, p > .05). However, \nhighly intrinsically motivated learners contributed more Experience (F (2, \n69) = 5.273, p < .05) and Explication (F (2, 69) = 3.859, p < .05). The fact \nthat no relationship has been found with respect to evaluation may be \ncaused by the limited number of messages that have been categorised as \nevaluation.   \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014775 \n \nTable 4.2 Learning indicators and student motivation \n  IMTK IMTA IMES EMID EMIN EMER AMOT \nContent Analysis        \nNon-task related 0.14 0.17 0.18 -0.02 0.03 0.01 0.17 \nPlanning (Cat. 1) 0.21 0.24* 0.24* 0.07 0.07 0.04 0.06 \nTechnical (Cat. 2) 0.22 0.21 0.26* -0.06 0.07 -0.05 0.07 \nSocial (Cat. 3) 0.17 0.10 0.12 -0.28* -0.03 -0.29* -0.13 \nNonsense (Cat. 4) 0.08 0.12 0.12 0.02 0.02 0.06 0.21 \n        \nTask-related 0.27* 0.24* 0.23* 0.03 0.00 -0.05 -0.09 \nFacts (Cat. 5) 0.23* 0.18 0.18 -0.05 -0.10 -0.13 0.00 \nExperience (Cat. 6) 0.29* 0.28* 0.28* 0.10 0.03 -0.02 -0.14 \nTheoretical Ideas \n(Cat. 7) \n0.22 0.23* 0.26* 0.01 0.11 0.03 -0.05 \nExplication (Cat. 8) 0.26* 0.25* 0.20 0.07 0.04 -0.01 -0.14 \nEvaluation (Cat. 9) -0.10 -0.08 -0.20 0.03 0.01 0.09 -0.08 \n*Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed). \n  \nWhile learners high on intrinsic motivation contribute actively and above \naverage to the various types of discourse, highly extrinsically motivated \nlearners contribute on average. Interestingly, there is one exception to this \nfinding: the extrinsically motivated learner who scores high on identified \nregulation (EMID) and external regulation (EMER) adds on average \nsignificantly less contributions labelled as social (category 3) in our online \nsettings (EMID r=-0.28; EMER r=-0.29, p < .05). Learners with high levels \nof a-motivation (AMOT) do not distinguish themselves, except on non-\nsense contributions (AMOT r=0.21, p > .05), be it marginally significant. In \nsum, students who are highly intrinsically motivated contribute more to \ncognitive discourse, in particular experience, theoretical ideas and \nexplication.  \n4.3 Relating students\u2019 motivation to position in social \nnetwork \nWhile the above analysis captures how differences in levels of the \nseveral facets of motivation are related to differences in the intensity to \ncontribute in the different types of discourse, the analysis does not allow us \nto investigate with whom a learner has interaction. By using an integrated \nsocial network analysis, a detailed picture of the role of motivation on \nlearning interaction processes can be established. All three aspects of \nintrinsic motivation are positively correlated with the three centrality \nmeasures from our social network analysis: see Table 4.3. This implies that \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 76 \nhighly intrinsically motivated students distinguish themselves (much \nstronger) from extrinsically and amotivated students also with respect to \ntheir position in the network. Especially students with high levels of intrinsic \nmotivation to know are central contributors to overall discourse (Reply \nDegree) (IMTK r=0.24, p < .05). Those students are also more central in \ntask-related discourse (IMTK r=0.27, p < .05) and in contributions of higher \ncognitive discourse (IMTK r=0.27; IMTA r=0.24, p < .05). \n \nTable 4.3 Centrality, ego-density and academic motivation \n  IMTK IMTA IMES EMID EMIN EMER AMOT \nSocial Network \nAnalysis        \nReply Degree 0.23* 0.21 0.18 0.00 0.00 -0.03 0.05 \nReply TR Degree 0.27* 0.21 0.18 0.01 -0.04 -0.07 -0.12 \nReply HC Degree 0.27* 0.24* 0.20 0.11 0.06 0.05 -0.16 \nSize 0.24* 0.21 0.22 -0.01 0.04 0.05 -0.02 \nTR Size 0.29* 0.26* 0.23* -0.02 0.05 -0.03 -0.08 \nHC Size 0.29* 0.29* 0.24* 0.13 0.05 0.04 -0.12 \n*Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed). \n  \nIf we also take into consideration the number of other learners an \nindividual learner is connected to (Size), again a positive relationship is \nfound for the three types of intrinsic motivation. In addition, when only \ntaking into consideration discourse activity of (higher) cognitive discourse, \nall intrinsic motivation types are significantly correlated (IMTK r=0.29; IMTA \nr=0.29; IMES r=0.24, p < .05). This implies that highly intrinsically motivated \nlearners both show up in the centre of the network but also on the outer \nfringe, but then as learners who have above average connections to other \nlearners. Students who are highly extrinsically motivated do not distinguish \nfrom the average student in our online setting. The number of links of highly \nextrinsically motivated learners is on average. A-motivation demonstrates a \nnegative but non-significant relationship with higher cognitive centrality (r=-\n0.16, n.s.) and higher cognitive size (r=-0.12, n.s.). \n  \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014777 \n5. DISCUSSION \nThe results of the present study indicate that individuals contribute \ndifferently to discourse in online settings, depending on their type of \nmotivation. Significant differences are found amongst individuals with \nrespect to the amount and type of discourse activity. Some learners are \nactive contributors to discourse, while other learners contribute only a \nlimited amount to discourse. Although these results have already been \nfound in other studies (e.g. Caspi et al., 2003; De Laat et al., 2007; J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 \net al., 2008; Schellens & Valcke, 2005; Veermans & Lallimo, 2007), this \nstudy is the first to empirically demonstrate that motivation is one of the \ndeterminants explaining the differences in the amount and quality of \ncontributions to discourse in online settings. We find that highly intrinsically \nmotivated learners contribute more task-related discourse than other types \nof learners. In addition, highly intrinsically motivated learners do not \ncontribute more non-task related messages per se, but differ with respect to \ncontributing to planning and technical issues. We find that highly \nextrinsically motivated students contribute less actively to non-task related \nissues. In particular, they contribute significantly less to discourse labelled \nby Veerman and Veldhuis-Diermanse (2001) as social contributions.  \nThe contribution to cognitive discourse in our setting is positively related \nto students with the level of intrinsic motivation. Learners high on intrinsic \nmotivation contribute more task-related discourse than other types of \nlearners. In particular, highly intrinsically motivated students contribute \nmore own experience, new theoretical ideas and explication. Extrinsically \nmotivated students \u201cunderperform\u201d relative to intrinsically motivated \nstudents on all task-related categories. Learners high on a-motivation do \nnot contribute less to discourse, which is contrary to prior expectations. \nWith respect to our first research question, the results indicate that \ndifferently motivated student do show different non-task related and task-\nrelated discourse activity.  \nWith respect to our second research question, large differences are \nfound amongst learners with respect to their position in the social network, \nwhich is in line with previous findings (De Laat et al., 2007; Hurme et al., \n2007; Russo & Koesten, 2005). A new feature in this article is that we are \nable to link the position of the learner in the social network to the type of \nmotivation. Central learners in the social network appear to be highly \nintrinsically motivated students. In addition, learners who have more \nconnections seem to be highly intrinsically motivated learners. Based upon \nour correlational analysis, learners with high levels of extrinsic motivation \ndo not differ from average learners in their position in the network.  \nIn order to answer our third research question, we have integrated the \nresults of content analysis with social network analysis, which improves our \ninsights of dynamic interaction processes in CSCL. Centrality within the \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 78 \nnetwork decreases as we move to (higher) cognitive discourse. In addition, \nthe number of learners an average learner is connected to (ego-density) \ndecreases when discourse becomes more (higher) cognitive. As is shown \nby the two visualisations of the social networks, distinguishing the type of \ndiscourse leads to additional insights in interactive learning processes. \nLearners who are central in the overall network are not automatically \ncentral in the (higher) cognitive network. When we take only higher \ncognitive discourse activities into consideration, central contributors seem \nto be highly intrinsically motivated learners. Quite interestingly, when \nlooking at (higher) cognitive communication, having more ties to others is \nan important merit for learning. The correlation coefficients of ego-density \nand scores for intrinsic motivation are somewhat larger than those \ncoefficients of centrality and scores for intrinsic motivation, implying that \nhaving more ties might be more important than being in the centre of the \nsocial network. In other words, learners who are in between the centre and \nthe outer fringe of the network might also play an important role in \ncontributions to (higher) cognitive discourse. In sum, learners high on \nintrinsic motivation are more central in social networks of (cognitive) \ndiscourse and have more connections to other learners, while highly \nextrinsically motivated learners and a-motivated learners show no tendency \nto occupy certain positions in the network more often than other positions. \nBy distinguishing the type of motivation, we have shown that having \nstrong motivation is not sufficient for contributing to cognitive discourse, it is \nstrong intrinsic motivation that matters. These findings might have important \nconsequences on how we integrate the various motivational types into our \nlearning environment. Students who are extrinsically motivated like Don, \nSandra and Irine, appear to be poorly connected in the higher cognitive \nnetwork (Figure 4.2). Measures should be taken to let them not be excluded \nfrom participating in higher cognitive discourse in groups, as co-\nconstruction of knowledge has been shown to be a driving factor for \nlearning. On a positive note, most highly extrinsically motivated students \nperform on average despite the lack of external teacher regulation in our \ndistance learning setting. We had expected that strongly externally \nregulated students would find the design of the open collaboration setting \nless suitable for their motivational type. On a negative note, the fact that \nthere are large differences between (higher) cognitive discourse activities \namong intrinsic vs. extrinsic students might imply that highly extrinsically \nmotivated students might be difficult to externally regulate to participate in \nonline settings.  \nSocial Network Analysis (SNA) techniques provide a powerful tool to \nmeasure the dynamic interaction of learning processes within CSCL. By \nmeasuring interactivity of discourse activities at three levels of (cognitive) \ndiscourse, we find that individuals take different positions in social \nnetworks. In particular, integrating the results of the content analysis with \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014779 \nsocial network analysis, we are able to demonstrate that different patterns \nof interactivity exist in different types of discourse. Finally, the correlations \nof the Academic Motivation Scale with the results of the content analysis \nand social network analysis indicate that the degree and type of activity in \nonline learning depends on the type of motivation. \n5.1 Limitations \nThe results of this study are based on a multi-method approach, whereby \nContent Analysis is used to analyse what learners are contributing, Social \nNetwork Analysis is used to determine who is contributing, and finally \nAcademic Motivation Scale for analysing how motivation influences the \nlearner\u2019s behaviour. This can be viewed as a potential limitation to this \nstudy in that the (long-term) consequences on learning outcomes have not \nbeen demonstrated. Russo and Koesten (2005) have found that central \ncontributors to discourse also perform better on learning outcomes. In \naddition, preliminary findings indicate that active summer course \nparticipants outperform others in the first year of the bachelor programme \n(Rienties, Tempelaar, Dijkstra, Rehm, & Gijselaers, 2008). In a range of \nstudies focussing on learning in a face-to-face problem-based learning \nprogrammes in the Netherlands, correlations between these motivational \nscales and indicators describing learning process and learning outcome \naspects typically range between 0.10 and 0.20 (Tempelaar, 2006; \nTempelaar, Gijselaers, Schim van der Loeff, & Nijhuis, 2007). Given that \nthe correlations of motivation on discourse activity and position in the social \nnetwork in our study are larger than in face-to-face settings, we might \nexpect that the type of motivation has an even stronger influence on \nlearning outcomes in online settings. Besides the quantitative measures of \nlearning, implementing qualitative measures of learning like critical event \nrecall (e.g. De Laat et al., 2007; Veermans & Lallimo, 2007) might provide \nfurther evidence of how motivation influences learning in online settings. \nWe encourage researchers to assess the role of motivation on type of \ndiscourse and position in the network in other settings in order to verify our \nfindings.  \nA second limitation of this study is that no measures were taken to \nprevent self-selection in the summer course programme or to introduce a \ncontrol condition. Selecting or rejecting students based on types of \nmotivation rather than prior knowledge leads to ethical issues. Alternatively, \nrearranging learners in other groups based on their type of motivation might \nalso lead to ethical dilemmas. In our setting, which matches the practice \nteachers in online settings are confronted with (i.e. groups with a mix of \nvarious types of motivated students), we did not balance groups based on a \npre-determined mix of motivational types. Furthermore, we did not \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 80 \nintroduce a control condition as our primary research aim was to measure \nin a real-life realistic CSCL environment how learning processes were \ninfluenced by motivation. \nBased on our theoretical conceptions, we expected that the more \nexternally regulated a learner was, the less he\/she would contribute to \ndiscourse given the limited possibilities of teachers to impose external \nregulation in online settings. Furthermore, we expected that learners high \non a-motivation would contribute less to discourse due to their lack of \nmotivation. Although the correlations for extrinsically regulated and a-\nmotivated learners have the expected sign, the coefficients are not \nsignificant. Further research should assess whether specific groups of \nlearners can be identified using cluster analysis or by identifying extreme \ngroups in order to assess why no significant negative relationship was \nfound between contributions to discourse and a-motivation. Additionally, the \nlack of internalisation of the regulation to the self might be explained the \nshort duration of the course. Learners with strong external motivation to \neducation might need more time to internalise the regulation into the self \n(Guay et al., 2003). Another explanation might be that the limited external \nbenefits in our setting (i.e. credits) might lead extrinsically motivated \nstudents to put less effort into the course than others. By increasing the \ncohorts in the future, we expect that the coefficients will become significant \nas the sample size increases.  \nA final limitation was that we did not measure the mutual conception \namong participants. In groups that have more highly intrinsically motivated \nlearners, one might expect that more (higher) cognitive discourse activities \nare present than groups with low intrinsically motivated learners. However, \nas the number of groups (six) was rather small to conduct a group-level \nanalysis and the fact that it is difficult to measure interaction patterns on \ngroup level when CA and SNA-measures are combined, further research \nshould assess whether group-level effects also influence behaviour of \nindividual learners in CSCL settings. \n5.2 Future research and implications for education \nFuture research should investigate the impact of learner profiles on the \nbehaviours of learners in CSCL, for example by distinguishing various types \nof learners using cluster analytic methods (Veermans & Lallimo, 2007). In \naddition, by analysing how learners mutually influence each other in \ncollaborative learning, future research should assess how the type of \nmotivation of one learner influences the behaviour of others in virtual \nteams. Based on our findings, we will redesign the learning environment to \ncapitalise on the merits of social interaction, peer-support and planning of \nlearning processes. By increasing social presence in our virtual learning \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014781 \nenvironment by using Web 2.0 tools like blogs, wiki\u2019s and webconference, \nwe hope to increase the relatedness among learners. These findings are \nrelevant for teachers, managers, admission officers and schedulers as the \nresults imply the type of motivation has a moderately strong influence on \nthe type of discourse and position within the social network. Appropriate \nstrategies to deal with various types of motivation should be designed to \nassist each type of learner. \n6. APPENDIX \n6.1 Appendix A: Content Analysis scheme social and \ncognitive discourse \nVeerman and Veldhuis-Diermanse (2001) distinguish four activities of \nnon-task-related discourse, whereby the examples are taken from the \nonline course economics: \n \n1. Planning: \u201cShall we first complete Task 1, before we go on with the \nnext one?\"\u201d \n2. Technical: \u201cDoes anybody know how to add a graph to my \nthread?\u201d \n3. Social: \u201cI think that a lot of people are very motivated here, which \nis good\u201d  \n4. Nonsense: \u201cHave you all made up your mind to start studying at \nUM in September?\u201d \n \nIn the original coding scheme of Veerman and Veldhuis-Diermanse \n(2001), they consider three basic cognitive processing activities, namely \nnew information (facts, experience, theoretical ideas), explication and \nevaluation. However, Schellens and Valcke (2005) found that the three new \ninformation activities should be distinguished in separate activities. \nFurthermore, Schellens and Valcke (2005, p. 961) argue that the five task-\nrelated discourse activities should be ordered in a hierarchical structure, \nwhereby \u201c[c]onsecutive types of communication represent higher levels of \nknowledge construction\u201d: \n \n5. New fact, that is learners present information that is new in the \ncontext of the discussion: \u201cThe average rate of inflation in the U.S. \nfor 2004 is 2.7 %.\u201d \n6. Own Experience\/opinions: \u201cI think that VAT-taxes should be \nreduced to increase demand\u201d. \n  \n\u0147\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n 4\n \n 82 \n7. Theoretical ideas: \u201cIf we take the Circular Flow Model from the \nbook (Parkin\/Bade) you are right, because it only takes \nhouseholds into account\u201d. \n8. Explication. This is a type of communication that reflects a further \nrefining and\/or elaboration of earlier ideas: \u201cThere are actually \nquite a lot of different, more specific market forms, the ones you \nmentioned are the three big ones (monopoly, oligopoly and perfect \ncompetition), but some rare ones exist as well. For example a \nmonopsony exists\u201d. \n9. Evaluation. This type of written messages corresponds to a critical \ndiscussion of earlier information or ideas. It goes beyond a simple \nconfirmation or negation and reflects argumentations, reasonings, \njustifications. \n6.2 Appendix B: Two examples of messages consisting of \nmultiple elements \nThe following message was posted by Maria, after a discussion along \nseven messages on which market types exist. Tiffany had previously \nexplained that there are three market forms (i.e. monopoly, oligopoly and \nperfect competition). Coders 1-3 coded the first paragraph as an \nelaboration (category 8), while they coded the second paragraph as social \n(category 3). Therefore, the message was split. \n \n\u201cHey Tiffany! \nI would like to add the market of a cartel: a small group of large firms who may \nagree to work together (there are a type of moopoly), trying to keep their prices and \nprofits high. They only compete on a non-price basis\u2026 \nI think that a lot of people are very motivated here, which is good. I am of course \nmotivated too but in a little time conflict, but quite confident that I will manage. I \ndon\u2019t know how far we are meant to, perhaps the tutors can answer these \nquestions, but I think they just want us to write :-)\u201d \n \nAfterwards, Andre responded to the above message of Maria, whereby \ncoders 1-3 code the first paragraph as social (category 3), while they code \nthe second paragraph as an elaboration (category 8). \n \n\u201cHi Maria, \nI think it is good as well that we are all that over motivated, because we will get a lot \nmore information if everyone actively contributes something. I don\u2019t know if there \nare any restrictions about how far we want to go, are there? \n@ Tiffany \nThere are actually quite a lot of different, more specific market forms, the ones you \nmentioned are the three big ones (monopoly, oligopoly and perfect competition), \nbut some rare ones exist as well. For example a monopsony exists, this means \nthere is only one buyer in the market and more than one seller (for example \n The role of academic motivation in CSCL \u014783 \nweapons which are only bought by one certain government but could be produced \nby different companies).\u201d  \n6.3 Appendix C: Two examples of uncodeable messages \nThe message posted by Rick only includes a reference to a discussion \non the difference between nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and real \nGDP. Coder 1 coded this message as uncodeable, coder 2 as a new fact \n(category 5), and coder 3 as a new theoretical idea (category 7).  \n \n\u201cReference: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/aggregate_expenditure\u201d \n \nThe message posted by Maria after a series of messages discussing the \ndifference between nominal GDP and real GDP was coded by coder 1 as \nan elaboration (category 8), as it elaborated previous discussions. Coder 2 \ncoded it as a new fact (category 5), since the GINI coefficient was \nintroduced as new fact without reference to previous ones. Finally, coder 3 \ncoded it as an evaluation (category 9), as the measurement of GDP leads \nto several problems and Maria provided a possible solution by using the \nGINI coefficient. \n \n\u201cI think it is totally true what you said. A big weakness of the GDP is that it does not \nshow the distribution of wealth, but none of you has come up with a solution\u2026 \nI remember from my geography lessons that there is a gini index (also included in \ndata from CIA worldfact book) that shows the distribution of wealth. As ia wasnt \nable so far to get this library thing started, I can only give a link ti wikepedia, but \nperhaps someone else find something... \nAnother thing I remember from school when talking about development and \ninequality is that we had data that showed the share of the GDP for the poorest and \nfro the richest 10% of the population. So if there was a big difference (eg poor 4%, \nrich 40%) one can assume that there s a very unfais distribution of wealth. \n \nAny additional info? \nHas anybody heard of it, too? \nReference: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gini_index\u201d \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their \nexcellent commentary.
