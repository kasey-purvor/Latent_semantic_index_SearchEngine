Introduction \nThe continuing need for oil and gas exploration and production is relentless despite the \navailability of renewable sources of energy.  The production of oil and gas involves well \ncompletion systems which must be designed to minimise corrosion and consequential \n                                                 \n*\n Corresponding Author.

The completion consists of a number of different sized casings inside the \nconductor used for drilling activities.  There is a gradual reduction in the size of the \ncasings with increasing well depth and each casing is cemented at the base to maintain \nborehole stability.  A typical oil and gas well completion configuration is shown in \nFigure 1. Annuli (A, B, C and D) are required at the top of each casing for well \nmanagement. The production casing may extend to a depth of 5 km below the sea bed. \nThe production casing is set in place and usually cemented above the production zone \nto provide a secondary barrier to well fluid in event of production tubing failure or leak \n(see Figure 1). Liners are hung off from the bottom of the production tubing and are \nusually sealed by a liner packer (a form of elastomeric seal) to direct well fluids, i.e. oil \nand gas, through the liner bore into the production tubing.  \n \nThe production annulus  (i.e. annulus A in Figure 1) normally contains clear brines, e.g. \nCaCl2, NaCl, NaCl\/NaBr, CaCl2\/CaBr2 etc., and\/or treated water (deionised, seawater \netc.) to provide hydrostatic head against the ingress of well fluids. The brine or water is \ntreated mainly with oxygen scavenger, usually biocide and corrosion inhibitor [1] to \nreduce corrosion to negligible levels. The term oxygen scavenger is partially misleading \nbecause many of the chemicals used for this purpose in oil and gas wells function \nmainly as passivating corrosion inhibitors in addition to scavenging of oxygen [2].  A \nnumber of chemicals are used as oxygen scavengers, e.g. sodium sulphite (Na2SO3), \nsodium bisulphite (NaHSO3), sodium metabisulphite (Na2S2O5), ammonium sulphite \n((NH4)2SO3.H2O) and ammonium bisulphite (NH4HSO3).   \n \nABS is one of the most commonly used oxygen scavengers in oil and gas wells \ncompletion and production systems.  It has the advantage over sodium bisulphite of \nbeing miscible with water in concentrated solution, i.e. 65% (straw coloured), at \nambient temperatures as low as 5 oC which is typical of the North Sea (United Kingdom \nContinental Shelf) environment. Under similar conditions, sodium bisulphite would \nprecipitate. Therefore this makes ABS the prominent oxygen scavenger used in the \nNorth Sea water systems. \n  \n3 \n \nCorrosion control is challenging without sufficient removal of oxygen and\/or \nprevention of oxygen ingress into well completions. ABS is injected into the wellbore \nproduction annulus to scavenge any dissolved oxygen in the brine or deionised water \n(potable water) used in the well completion process or for annulus management during \nthe operation phase respectively. In this application a successful treatment means \nreducing the oxygen to very low levels. Experience has shown that brine that contains \nless than 10 ppbw of dissolved oxygen is not corrosive to carbon steel casing and \nproduction tubing [2]. However, during oil and gas production, the brine\/ABS solution \nmight come into contact with hydrogen sulphide (H2S) due to acid gas (CO2 and H2S) \ningress  from the reservoir to the annulus, e.g. via a leak path such as at the packer seal \n(Figure 1). ABS has been implicated in downhole failure of production tubing used in a \nnumber of high pressure \u2013 high temperature (HPHT) well completions due to acid gas \ningress to the production annulus [3-5]; the ABS assisted failure was suggested to be \ndue to ABS degradation at high temperature leading to increase in sulphide.  \n \nThe interaction between ABS and H2S yields sulphuric acid (Eqns (1) and (2)): \n   \n4NH4HSO3 + 3H2S  \u2192  4NH4HS + 3H2SO4     (1) \n \n4NH4HSO3 + 4NaCl + H2S  \u2192  4NH4Cl + 3H2SO4 +2Na2S   (2) \n \nStrong acids are aggressive towards steel even in anaerobic conditions. In order to \nunderstand the competing effects of oxygen scavenging and acidification more \nquantitatively and the consequent effect on failure due to corrosion, an investigation of \nsulphide concentration in this solution is required. Material qualification for production \ntubing e.g. super duplex stainless steel is usually based on brine chemistry, acid gas \npartial pressure and designated stress to establish immunity or susceptibility to \nenvironment assisted cracking (EAC) in the environment. The addition of other sulphur \nspecies may lead to susceptibility to EAC in an environment that it would otherwise be \nimmune. \n \n4 \n \nAn assessment of the degradation associated with the corrosion of a material requires a \nknowledge and understanding of the characteristics of the environment. The focus of \nthe current work is not on the corrosion behaviour or mechanisms of oil and gas \ntubulars but on the understanding of the service or operation induced changes in the \nenvironment that aids corrosion. It is generally assumed within the oil and gas industry \nthat the addition of 100 ppmw of ABS is sufficient to completely scavenge dissolved \noxygen in all types of aqueous solutions used in production annulus.  Although this \nassumption may be true for seawater, there is no evidence that this suggested \nminimum level of ABS needed to completely scavenge oxygen is valid for other types of \naqueous solutions used in the production annulus.  The objectives of the current work \nare two-fold: (i) to determine the minimum concentration of ABS required to \ncompletely scavenge oxygen in deionised water, 1 wt% NaCl and 3.5 wt% NaCl \nsolution, and (ii) to assess the effect of H2S gas on various concentrations of ABS in \nthese solutions.  \n \n2. Experimental Procedures \nThere is currently no National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) buffer or \nstandard for determining sulphide levels in acid gas mixtures. Although it is recognised \nthat acid gas mixtures are usually encountered in hydrocarbon reservoirs, ABS\/brine \nsolutions were bubbled with H2S gas only in this study. The solutions considered were: \ndeionised water, 1 wt% NaCl and 3.5 wt% NaCl. The ABS concentrations in each type of \nsolution were 0, 100, 500 and 1000 ppmw.   \n \nReagent grade NaCl (supplied by Fisher Scientific) was used to prepare the 1 wt% NaCl \nand 3.5 wt% NaCl. The ABS (supplied by Baker Petrolite) concentration was varied in \nthe range 0 to 12000 ppmw in each solution and the dissolved oxygen and pH level, at \neach concentration of ABS, were measured using an Orion\u2020 dissolved oxygen probe and \na Russell pH glass bodied electrode (Russell pH, KDCW11) respectively. A magnetic \nstirrer was engaged prior to and during measurement of dissolved oxygen to ensure \n                                                 \n\u2020\n Orion Water Environmental Instruments \n5 \n \nthe dissolved oxygen concentration was representative of the bulk solution.  All flasks, \nglassware, measuring cylinders etc. used for the experiments were carefully cleaned \nwith distilled water and oven dried to prevent cross contamination.  \n \nAll experiments were carried out using the test loop shown in Figure 2 which was \nlocated in a fume cupboard. A combined electrochemical technique and visual \nobservation approach was used in the test program to take measurements and observe \nchemical reactions.  \n \nThe reaction vessel (Figure 2) was almost completely filled with the test solutions then \nclosed to prevent air contamination. The reaction cell consisted of the respective \nsolution and a gas tight rubber stopper with access holes for electrodes, thermometer, \nand gas inlet and outlet tubes. Fitted into the stopper were all the pre-calibrated \nelectrodes for dissolved oxygen, sulphide, EH and pH. The temperature was regulated at \n25 oC with a circulating water bath surrounding the reaction vessel (Figure 2).  The \nmanometer was filled with saturated brine before the test started to ensure positive \npressure (1 atmosphere) was maintained in the test loop. \n \nNitrogen gas (99.999% purity) was bubbled at 200 \u2013 250 ml\/minute through the frit in \nthe reaction vessel to deaerate the solution and vented into the fume cupboard through \nthe vent port in the test loop. After approximately one hour, the dissolved oxygen probe \nwas used to confirm the test solution was oxygen free before H2S gas was then \nintroduced at 100 ml\/minute. Whilst bubbling, the H2S gas was diverted to the \nmanometer. The saturated brine levels in the manometer were maintained to ensure \npressure was maintained at 1 atmosphere in the test cell. Sulphide, EH and pH \nmeasurements were continuously recorded at 15 seconds interval after H2S gas \nbubbling commenced using a computerised data logger.   \n \nThe experiments on the determination of the concentration of ABS required to \ncompletely scavenge oxygen were carried out three times while the experiments to \n6 \n \nassess the effect of H2S gas on various concentrations of ABS were carried out twice on \nnominally identical solutions, to check for repeatability. \n \nThe reliability of the readings depends on accurate calibration of the measuring \nequipment.  All the instruments used in this study were calibrated according to the \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommended guidelines and buffer solutions. In particular, the \nsulphide electrode was calibrated using potassium hydrogen phthalate (0.05 M \nKHC8H4O4) solution in deionised water to obtain a pH 4.01 buffer solution; the sulphide \nconcentration in ppmw was obtained from the measured potential by Nernst \nequation [6]   \n \nE  = E0 + Q log (A)        (3) \n \nwhere E is the measured electrode potential in mV, E0 (= 908.4 mV ) is the reference \npotential, A  is the level of sulphide in solution in mol\/litre (1 mol\/l = 32064 ppmw S2\u00af), \nand Q (= 32 mV\/decade) is the gradient of E versus log (A) curve.   \n \n  \n3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n3.1 Effect of ABS on dissolved oxygen \nThe effect of ABS concentration on the dissolved oxygen (without N2 bubbling) and the \npH of deionised water are shown in Figure 3 for three identically prepared solutions.  \nThe pH of the three nominally identical solutions was identical to within less than 1% \nand the dissolved oxygen was identical to within 3% for the range of ABS concentration \nconsidered.  Similar level of consistency in the measurements was obtained for the \nrepeated tests on the 1 wt% NaCl, 3.5 wt% NaCl and natural seawater.  Consequently, \nfor clarity, only a representative result of each variable for each of the test solutions is \npresented in the rest of the paper.  \n \n7 \n \nThe effect of ABS concentration on the dissolved oxygen and the pH of all the test \nsolutions is shown in Figure 4. Both the dissolved oxygen and pH decrease with \nincreasing ABS concentration in deionised water, 1 wt% NaCl, 3.5 wt% NaCl and \nnatural seawater (North Sea).  \n \nThe pH of the natural seawater was 8 whilst it was slightly less than 7 for deionised \nwater (6.9) and 1 wt% NaCl (6.8) and slightly above 7 for 3.5 wt% NaCl (7.3). A \nsignificant reduction in pH occurred after 100 ppmw ABS was added but little change in \npH at ABS doses greater than 2000 ppmw; the pH range was between 4.8 and 5.2 for all \nsolutions at 2000 ppmw ABS and greater. Note that the pH of undiluted ABS was 4.6. \n \nA significant amount of ABS was required to scavenge the oxygen in deionised water, \n1 wt% NaCl and 3.5 wt% NaCl (see Figure 4a). The average minimum concentration of \nABS required for complete removal of dissolved oxygen in the test solutions is shown in \nFigure 5.  It is generally assumed within the oil and gas industry that the addition of \n100 ppmw of ABS is sufficient to completely scavenge aqueous solutions used in the \nproduction annulus.  The present study shows that this is only the case for natural \nseawater.   It should be noted though that the seawater used in this study did not \ncontain hypochlorite, biocides etc. that can affect the performance of oxygen scavengers \nin water injection systems [1, 7]. The reaction between oxygen and sulphite based \nscavengers involves a chain (propagation process) mechanism [1], which means they \nare very sensitive to temperature and the presence of other dissolved species. \n \nNatural seawater contains a range of constituents not present in deionised water or \nsynthetic NaCl solutions, for example, transition metal ions like cobalt, which can \nimprove the performance of ABS as an oxygen scavenger [2]. This is supported by the \nabove findings which show that considerably greater ABS concentrations are required \nto remove dissolved oxygen in deionised water and synthetic brines. Further, greater \naddition of oxygen scavenger led to a decrease in pH, which reduces the efficiency of \nscavenging as indicated by Snavely [8] for sulphite based scavengers below pH 7.  \n \n8 \n \nAs the ABS concentration increases, the reduction in redox potential (EH) becomes less \nsignificant, as indicated in Figure 6. The highest rate of EH reduction is observed for the \nfirst 100 ppmw ABS (for which there is a similar significant decrease in pH), with a \nmore gradual reduction in EH with further increases in ABS concentration. ABS is a \nreducing agent, typical of many oxygen scavengers [2], the bisulphite ion being oxidised \nto bisulphate: \n \n2HSO3 (aq) + O2 (aq)  2HSO4 (aq).      (4) \n \nIn this reaction, sulphur is oxidised (S(IV)  S(VI) + 2e ) and the oxygen is reduced \n(O2(aq) + 2e   O2 (aq)) in formation of sulphate. The drop in the rate of conversion of \nO2(aq) to O2  at higher ABS concentrations may be attributed to the increasing scarcity of \nO2(aq) in these more heavily dosed ABS systems. It is important to note also that pH has \nan important influence on the electrochemical stability of the various sulphur species, \nwhich has an impact on electrochemical potential. However, the results of the current \nexperiment have shown that pH remains relatively constant at between 4.8 and 5.4 \nabove very low additions (100 ppmw) of ABS.  \n \n3.2 Effect of H2S on sulphide in NaCl\/ABS solution \nA reliable quantitative measurement and qualitative assessment of sulphide requires \nstrictly controlled environmental conditions. Complete oxygen removal and oxygen \ningress was prevented during all the experimental work to prevent formation of other \nsulphur compounds. In addition to electrochemical measurements (dissolved oxygen, \nsulphide, EH and pH) an important aspect of the testing was visual observation of the \nsolutions prior to and during H2S bubbling. The dissolved oxygen probe was used to \nmeasure dissolved oxygen levels in solution during the deaeration phase only, whilst all \nthe other measurements were recorded simultaneously at intervals during the H2S \nbubbling phase. Recall that complete deaeration was achieved by the addition of \nnitrogen gas. \n \n9 \n \nThe pH, sulphide concentration and oxidation reduction potential, EH, for two \nnominally identical solutions of deionised water containing 1000 ppmw ABS are shown \nin Figure 7. Note that H2S bubbling started after about 40 mins from the start of the test; this \ncorresponded to when there was complete deaeration.  The good level of consistency in the \nmeasurements shown in Figure 7 was also obtained for the other solutions considered \nin part of the current study. Hereafter, only representative results of the pH, sulphide \nconcentration and EH for each of the test solutions is presented.  \n \nThe pH from the start of deaeration is shown in Figure 8 for all the solutions. The \narrows in Figure 8 indicate the moment when H2S was introduced, which corresponds \nto the end of deaeration. After deaeration, the pH of ABS-free deionised water, 1 wt% \nNaCl and 3.5 wt% NaCl solutions were 7.4, 7.88 and 7.98 respectively.  The pH of the \nABS-free solutions increased with increasing level of deaeration due to decrease in \nsolution conductivity with deaeration. During H2S gas bubbling, the pH of the ABS-free \ndeionised water decreased until the termination of the test.  As indicated in \nequation (1), this is due to the formation of an acidic solution. \n \nThe initial level of dissolved oxygen in the solutions containing various concentrations \nof ABS (100, 500 and 1000 ppmw) is summarised in Table 1. Some deaeration was still \nnecessary to ensure the solution was oxygen free before H2S was introduced. When H2S \nbubbling commenced (after complete deaeration) there was a decrease in pH in all \nsolutions; the extent of which corresponded with the level of ABS in the solution. \nHowever, the decrease in pH was only temporary (see Figure 8). As indicated in \nequation (2), although the reaction results in an acidic solution the pH stabilises due to \nthe formation of sodium sulphide (Na2S), the alkalinity of which counteracts the effects \nof sulphuric acid. The solution with the highest concentration of ABS experienced the \nlowest pH and the longest extended period before increase in pH was observed. \nConsequently, it is shown that ABS had more effect on the pH of all the solutions than \nH2S.  \n \n10 \n \nABS is routinely used in the oil and gas industry to scavenge dissolved oxygen in brines \nused in well completions.  ABS is a corrosive liquid because of the low pH it generates \nin the formation of reaction products. As metabisulphite is oxidised to metabisulphate in \nthe presence of oxygen, the acidification effects of metabisulphate produces sulphuric acid.  \nIn the current experiment the aqueous medium was deaerated completely. If the \nscavenging reaction does not proceed to completion, sulphite and oxygen can coexist in \ntreated water and brine [2] further exacerbating oxygen corrosion risk in well \ncompletion production casing usually made of carbon steel and stress corrosion \ncracking risk in well completion production tubing which is usually made of duplex \nstainless steels. \n \n3.3  Oxidation reduction potential (EH) \nThe redox potential in all the solutions considered is shown in Figure 9. The sulphide \nand bisulphite in the solutions with ABS form a couple that results in a reducing \nenvironment that continued until test termination. The addition of H2S gas into the \nsolutions with 100 ppmw ABS led to a significant decrease in EH, followed by \nprecipitation of sulphur in the NaCl (1 and 3.5 wt%) solutions and subsequent minimal \nchange in EH. Whereas, in the solutions with 500 and 1000 ppmw ABS there was an \ninitial decrease in EH during precipitation of sulphur (see Figure 8), followed by a \nfurther decrease until termination of the test. Overall the change in EH in the 100 ppmw \nABS\/H2S solutions was not significant after precipitation compared to the 500 and \n1000 ppmw ABS\/H2S solutions where significant change in EH occurred after \nprecipitation. It appeared from visual observation that there was more elemental \nsulphur in the NaCl solutions during precipitation. The precipitation occurred sooner as \nthe ABS concentration in the NaCl solutions increased and for a longer period. The tests \nwere terminated when the change in EH was negligible. The EH continued to decrease \nuntil the termination of the test in the ABS free solution.   \n \n11 \n \n3.4 Sulphide \nSimilar to the pH and EH measurements the sulphide measurements in the solution \nunder consideration followed the same trend (Figure 10).  Note that there was no \nincrease in sulphide in the ABS-free solutions; thus this has been omitted from \nFigure 10. An increase in sulphide was recorded in all solutions with ABS; however the \nincrease in sulphide was measured sooner in all solutions with 100 ppmw ABS \ncompared to those with 500 and 1000 ppmw ABS due to minimal precipitation. Recall \nthat H2S bubbling was carried out at 100 ml\/min for all the solutions considered.  The \nrate of increase of sulphide with continued bubbling of the H2S was found to be \napproximately 10 ppbw\/min, independent of the chloride and ABS concentrations in \nthe solution (see Figure 10). \n \nWhen H2S was bubbled through all the solutions with ABS included, a white turbidity of \nsulphur was seen after a short period.  Depending on equilibrium conditions, sulphur \nmay exist in various oxidation states in aqueous complex species (see Table 2). If \nequilibrium were attained, only H2S, HS\u00af\u00af, S2\u00af\u00af, S, HSO4\u00af\u00af and SO42\u00af\u00af ought to be found in \nsolution according to the Pourbaix diagram for sulphur and water at 25 oC for ideal \nsolutions [9], see Figure 11. In acid solutions, the total sulphide is present mainly in the \nform of H2S but as the pH increases the principle species present is HS\u00af\u00af and only in very \nbasic solution does the total sulphide exist mainly in the form of free sulphide ion (S2\u00af\u00af) .   \n \nHeunisch [10] noted that when the pH dips below about 6, generally after the \nHSO3 \/HS  mole ratio has been exceeded and excess HSO3\u00af\u00af ion is added, a finely \ndivided, white precipitate of elemental sulphur forms and will not redissolve on \nstanding. It has also been reported that elemental sulphur is formed predominantly \nfrom the sulphide-sulphite system in acidic solutions where the sulphide is present in \nexcess [11]. From Figures 8 and 9, the onset of precipitation (i.e. presence of sulphur) \ncoincides with the occurrence of the minimum pH which then increases thereafter and \nstabilises; this is consistent with Heunisch\u2019s results.  \n \n12 \n \nThere will always be the same total amount of sulphur species in each solution but the \namount present as sulphide and sulphur will vary with the pH (Figure 8)[2,12]. There \nwas more sulphide in the deionised water compared to the 1 wt% NaCl and 3.5 wt% \nNaCl solutions (Figure 10). In deionised water the sulphur was mainly in solution as \nbisulphide, see equation (1), whereas in the NaCl solutions it appears that there was \nless sulphide in solution (being less milky by visual observation) and more sulphur \nprecipitated as the concentration of ABS increased from 100 to 1000 ppmw.  Table 3 \nshows the results of the tests in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution with 1000 ppmw ABS and H2S \ngas bubbling after deaeration. Note the initial increase in the absolute sulphide \npotential, then a decrease before a steady increase. This trend was observed in all \nsolutions (deionised water, 1 and 3.5 wt% NaCl) with ABS especially when 500 or \n1000 ppmw was added to the test solution. The pH followed a similar trend (Figure 8) \ni.e. an initial decrease followed by an increase. The initial decrease in sulphide was due \nto the initiation of precipitation (opalescence) and low pH. When the bubbling with H2S \ngas starts, it lowers the pH, which will decrease the sulphide present in the solution as \nmore sulphur, in HS\u00af\u00af and H2S species forms in addition to the precipitate. The initial \ndecrease in pH also coincides with where the solution started to turn milky, i.e. \nprecipitation. The beginning of precipitation was stronger and quicker in line with \nhigher concentration of ABS in all solutions.   The precipitation was observed when the \nmeasured EH and pH values were in the range 300 \u2264 EH \u2264 100 and 4 \u2264 pH \u2264 6 \nrespectively; this is included in the Pourbaix diagram shown in Figure 11.  The \nexperimental results indicate a transition from H2S to S in the solutions; this is \nconsistent with the white turbidity observed in the experiment.  \n \nElemental sulphur is only stable under mildly oxidising to mildly reducing conditions at \na pH below 8. The measured pH (Figure 8) and EH (Figure 9) of the ABS-H2S solutions \n(with 500 and 1000 ppmw ABS) for deionised water, 1 wt% NaCl and 3.5 wt% NaCl \nsolutions in the current study correspond to the area of the Pourbaix diagram which \npredicts stable H2S and sulphur precipitation (Figure 11).  \n \n13 \n \nSince the amount of sulphur present in the sulphide form is very pH dependent, this is \nmost likely the cause of sulphide being measured in the sample containing ABS. The \naddition of H2S to the solutions with ABS only results in momentary change in the pH of \nthe solutions, which allows for sulphide to be present in a condition when it otherwise \nwould not be. Precipitation of sulphur was more obvious in the 1 wt% NaCl and \n3.5 wt% NaCl solutions plus ABS albeit actual measured sulphide was less compared to \nthe deionised water solutions (Figure 12). It appears that sulphur stayed more in \nsolution as sulphide in the deionised water compared to 1 wt% NaCl and 3.5 wt% NaCl \nsolution.  \n \n4.  Implications for corrosion in oil and gas well completion systems \nThe results of this investigation showed the formation of sulphur and sulphide in \nNaCl\/ABS mixed with H2S gas. The amount of sulphur and sulphide is found to be a \nfunction of the pH, which in turn depends on the ABS concentration. This has major \nimplications for the corrosion behaviour of oil and gas completion tubulars where the \ningress of H2S into the production annulus containing brine solution is not uncommon. \n \nThe measurements performed by Brunner et al. [13] showed that sulphur solubility in \nH2S gas decreases with decrease in temperature and pressure. If there was H2S gas \ningress into the annulus (due to packer damage) of a well completion, the gas stream \nwill cool down and the pressure will drop as it rises in the annulus. It is conceivable \ntherefore that sulphur may be deposited on the tubing. Kolts [14] found elemental \nsulphur increased the risk of crevice attack in corrosion resistant alloys including DSS. \nMahmoud [15] and Ueda et al. [16] concluded that pitting and crevice corrosion \noccurred at surface areas of high nickel alloys that had been in direct contact with \nelemental sulphur in the presence of chlorides.  Coyle [17] also found that the presence \nof sulphur increases the susceptibility of high nickel alloys to SCC. \n \nIn HPHT well completions the solubility of H2S and CO2 will be affected by pressure and \ntemperature. The solubility of gases increases with increasing pressure. Henry's law \nstates that under ideal conditions, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly \n14 \n \nproportional to the pressure of that gas above the surface of the solution. Henry\u2019s law is \nlimited to dilute systems at low pressures. Therefore at HPHT conditions the non-\nideality of gases begins to affect solubility [18]. Nelson et al. [19] showed that the \nHenry\u2019s law over predicts the concentration of dissolved H2S in water above 10.3 MPa \n(103 bar) and determined that the ensemble Henry\u2019s law is the most accurate \ndescription of gas-liquid equilibrium at high pressure. Although the tests in the current \nstudy were carried out at 1 atmosphere and 25 oC it is surmised that if the \nconcentration of the H2S at HPHT is reproduced correctly in a laboratory test, the \nreaction products between ABS and H2S should be similar. \n \n5. Conclusions \nThe aqueous reaction of ABS (various concentrations) in deionised water, 1 wt% NaCl \nand 3.5 wt% NaCl and H2S has been investigated. Through the course of the \nexperiments, sulphide was measured in solutions that included ABS. Increase in \nsulphide was not measured in blank solutions in all experiments. Nevertheless, the \nmain conclusions are as follows: \n \n1. Although it is generally assumed within the oil and gas industry that the \naddition of 100 ppmw ABS is sufficient to completely scavenge aqueous \nsolutions used in the production annulus, a concentration of 100 ppmw ABS or \nless does not scavenge the dissolved oxygen to less than 10 ppbw in deionised \nwater, 1 wt% NaCl and 3.5 wt% NaCl solutions.  This new finding would enable a \nmore effective use of ABS as oxygen scavenger to mitigate corrosion in oil and \ngas completion systems.  \n2. There is a relationship between the amounts of sulphide measured and ABS \nconcentration in all H2S solutions at low pH.  The sulphide level increases as the \nABS concentration increases. \n3. In all solutions the level of precipitation of sulphur increased as the ABS \nconcentration increased. \n15 \n \n4. There were more sulphides in deionised water set of solutions with ABS, i.e. 100, \n500 and 1000 ppmw ABS compared to 1 wt% NaCl and 3.5 wt% NaCl solutions \nwith similar concentration of ABS.  \n5. Though less sulphide was measured in the NaCl solutions compared to \ndeionised water solutions, sulphur was more discernable in line with increase in \nABS concentration (100 to 1000 ppmw ABS) in NaCl solutions.  \n6. In ABS\/H2S solutions, the ABS behaved like a pH buffer in solution due to \nrelatively constant pH of the solutions during H2S bubbling until the termination \nof the test.  \n \nABS is routinely used in the oil gas industry to scavenge dissolved oxygen in brines \nused in well completions or deionised water (potable water) used in the production \nannulus for well management in the operation phase. In the presence of H2S, the \nbisulphite is reduced to sulphide and sulphur thus ABS should be included in material \nqualification test programs of production tubing especially where H2S presence is \nidentified. Oxygen scavengers without a sulphite component should be considered for \nuse in well completions production annulus during the operation phase. However, if no \nsuitable alternative exists then ABS concentration should not exceed 100 ppmw in \nsolution (with chloride less than 0.1 wt% NaCl) and all the oxygen scavenged. \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Shell UK, Gary Smith of the \nDepartment of Chemistry, University of Aberdeen for the set-up of the test loop, and to \nNorma Thomson for the supply of the chemicals. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1]  T.G.
