At the time David had\nencouraged us to publish the work in ALT-J. We postponed the publication of this work so\nthat it could appear in this memorial issue.\n41\nMichael Kemp et al From classroom tutor to hypertext adviser: an evaluation\nIntroduction\nIn response to an initiative to improve student attendance and appreciation of pathology\npracticals, case-based teaching was introduced to a first-year undergraduate Pathology\ncourse (McCullagh and Roche, 1992). The practicals were designed as part of a total\nexperience, to build upon material recently presented in lectures, and they typically\nincluded notes on a case study, slides and a microscope. Students were required to answer a\nnumber of questions related to the case study and the practicals were followed by tutorial\ndiscussion groups in which the issues raised could be explored and reflected upon. The\npracticals were self-paced and the students could ask for assistance from demonstrators\nwhenever they wished, although the majority of problems were sorted out by discussion\nbetween students.\nThese labs were informal; there were generally around eighty students present in each lab\nsession, and there was a background noise consistent with many students engaging in\nconversation. Students arranged themselves informally into groups of between two and\neight. These labs were perceived to be popular and effective. The problems were the\ndifficulty in recruiting sufficient trained demonstrators and the potential for some students\nto take back seats. In some cases perhaps only one student would do the microscope work\nin spite of the possibility of using monitors.\nHowever, there was a need to economize and it was decided to conduct a two-part\nexperiment:\n\u2022 to introduce some courseware to replace the practicals;\n\u2022 to investigate the possibility of doing without demonstrators for the courseware\npracticals.\nAt the same time the pathology staff hoped that there might be educational gains from the\nintroduction of courseware, since courseware may be used many times, allowing students\nthe opportunity, after their tutorial discussion groups for example, to revisit the work and\nreconceptualize the material (Mayes, 1993; Mayes, 1995).\nIn this paper we start by briefly describing the research context within which this work was\nconducted. We continue by describing the nature of the courseware that was designed to\nreplace the practicals and by detailing the results of the first evaluation of this courseware,\nwhich demonstrated that student learning did not suffer from the use of the software while\ndemonstrators were still present. Encouraged by this result a second trial was conducted,\nthis time without demonstrators present when the students used the courseware. Again the\nresults were encouraging, but the evaluation demonstrated that students had not always\nsucceeded in getting answers to some of their questions. The final section describes a third\ntrial in which a hypertext software adviser was used to provide students with additional\nhelp. The evaluation of this trial demonstrates that students found the adviser helpful and\nwere more likely to accept the software and to find answers to their questions.\nContext\nMany evaluations of the adoption of courseware have a positive result in that they tend to\ndemonstrate that student learning is either unaffected or improved by the intervention; for\n42\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nexample, see the 'the no significant difference phenomenon' (Russell, 1999; Johnson,\nAragon, Shaik and Palma-Rivas, 2000).\nHowever, there have been some more recent ethnographic studies (such as Hara and Kling,\n1999) pointing out that students are not always pleased with the learning experience, and\nmay be frustrated by the environment and their inability to talk with someone to solve their\nproblems. In the more extreme cases they see such methods as attempts by universities to\nabsolve themselves of their teaching duties (Noble, 1998). As a result recent research has\nexamined ways in which communication with and between students can be maintained\nwithin an online environment (Wegerif, 1998; Arvan, Ory, Bullock, Burnaska and Hanson,\n1998). This work adds further evidence to the debate, and introduces a software adviser\nagent as part of the solution to the problem of maintaining dialogue.\nA particular feature of courseware that this work addresses is that of replacing practical\nlaboratories with virtual practicals. There is a body of work in this area which aims at\nproducing virtual or remote practicals (for example, Colwell and Scanlon, 2001) in order to\nmake the experience available to distance students, to share expensive experiments more\nwidely or to make dangerous experiments safer. The focus of this work was concerned with\nmaking economies in terms of laboratory equipment, laboratory space and demonstrator\ntime.\nThe SCALPEL courseware\nThe general principle in building the SCALPEL (Southampton Computer Assisted\nLearning Pathology Education Laboratory) courseware was to design an environment to\nreplicate the same six case studies previously delivered in the traditional laboratory. The\ndesign constitutes a main window containing these case studies. Hyperlinks were authored\ninto the text to provide access to the same supplementary material previously provided in\nthe lab, that is, pictures, videos and images of microscope work. Additional online\nbackground material could easily be referenced and searched when required. A Multiple\nChoice Question (MCQ) engine was also integrated with the courseware in order to allow\nthe students immediate feedback on whether they were getting the correct answers to the\nquestions in the case study.\nThe courseware was implemented using Microcosm (Hall, Davis and Hutchings, 1996).\nThe rationale for this decision was mainly due to Microcosm's facilities for integrating with\nthird-party applications; in this experiment two-way integration with the MCQ engine\n(provided by the STOMP TLTP project) was an important feature, and in the case where a\nstudent asked for help from background materials the engine had to be able to follow links\nback to content. Integration with the Media Viewer was also important. Two other features\nof Microcosm that were useful were generic links (Fountain, Hall, Heath and Davis, 1990)\nwhich allowed the rapid authoring of links from all occurrences of keywords and phrases\nto appropriate materials, and the computer-link facility which used advanced text search\nfeatures dynamically to locate suitable materials for the user.\nThe initial design of SCALPEL was in 1996; at this stage the Web was still in its infancy\nand browsers had support for little more than rendering of html. The Web was seen as\nencouraging a didactic view of learning, rather than the student-controlled exploratory\nstyle (Crook and Webster, 1997) that was needed for these case studies.\n43\nMichael Kemp et al From classroom tutor to hypertext adviser: an evaluation\n' --\u00abi\n\" ' . - > \u00bb \/ . * \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 <! ? r r ^ a\nfigure \/: 7he SCALPEL interface\nFigure 1 shows a screenshot of the SCALPEL interface. The case study notes are on the\nright. The user has followed a link to see two histology slides, and the MCQ engine is ready\nfor the student's answer to the question in the case study.\nIt would be possible to create a fairly similar learning experience using any of the now\nwidely available virtual learning environments (VLEs), but the choice of environment was\nfortuitous in making the courseware simple to deliver.\nEvaluation methodology\nThe evaluations were undertaken in three consecutive years. In each year there were around\n160 first-year undergraduate medical students. The unchanged selection procedures and\nthe collection of demographic data gave us confidence that from year to year these\nstudents formed a very similar selection of the population, and that it was therefore\npossible to generalize results from year to year. It is probably reasonable further to\ngeneralize the results for the whole body of undergraduate medical students but wider\ngeneralization to the population as a whole should only be done with caution.\nQuantitative data were collected using questionnaires. These questionnaires asked for\nanswers to factual and non-factual attitudinal information. The latter answers were\ncollected on a five-point Likert scale (Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly\ndisagree). The sense of the wording of some indicators was reversed to prevent the results\nbeing affected by, for example, students agreeing with everything. Complex attitudes were\nmeasured using a number of facets of that attitude, and then those facets were averaged.\nQuestionnaires were pre-trialled with colleagues to highlight any problems before they\nwere presented to students. All questionnaires were anonymous.\nIn the first trial the practical sessions were timetabled, and questionnaires were distributed\nat the halfway point and at the end of the final practical, so that return rates were 100 per\ncent (N=157). In the second trial students completed the practicals in their own time, and\nwere requested to return questionnaires when they had finished. This led to a much lower\nresponse rate (N=97\/160). In the final trial, in spite of organizing a sweepstake offering two\n44\nAn-) Volume 10 Number 3\n\u00a350 prizes (students could cut a corner off their questionnaire, write their name on it and\nadd it to the sweepstake, thus maintaining anonymity), the return rate fell even further (N=\n74\/165).\nIn addition to the quantitative data collection, focus groups were held and students were\nobserved using the system. No attempt was made to quantify the data collected, but rather\nthe results were used to add substance to and to help interpret the results gained from\nanalysis of the questionnaires.\nThose who wish to see greater depth of methodology are referred to Michael Kemp's Ph.D.\nthesis (Kemp, 2000) to see the hypotheses tested, the statistical tests applied and the full\nexperimental results.\nOnline labs: the first evaluation\nThe main purpose of the first evaluation was to discover whether there was any measurable\nchange in the effectiveness of learning when lab practicals were replaced with SCALPEL\ncourseware. Clearly an important facet of the introduction of any new teaching method is\nto convince staff that students would not fare worse as the result of the change. As a sub-\nagenda we chose to investigate whether there were any groups of students who fared better\nor worse as the result of the change, where groups were defined by such concepts as\ndemographics, preferred learning style and previous exposure to computers.\nFor this part of the study twenty-three hypotheses were tested: the fundamental three were\nabout pedagogic value.\n1. The educational attainment of pathology on average differs between medical students\nwho work through practicals in the traditional laboratory and those who use\nSCALPEL.\n2. Medical students find SCALPEL an acceptable pedagogic environment.\n3. Medical students' acceptance of SCALPEL influences educational attainment.\nHypotheses 4-9 looked at what aspects of students (demographics, learning styles,\nattitudes, and so on) influenced the pedagogic value of SCALPEL. Hypotheses 10-13\nlooked at what student characteristics affected their need for demonstrators. Hypotheses\n14-18 looked at what characteristics might affect their attitude to computers and\nhypotheses 19-23 looked at how student characteristics affected learning style.\nFor the purpose of this study the students were split into two groups. Group A did the first\nthree practicals using the traditional lab and the next three practicals using SCALPEL,\nwhereas Group B did the first three practicals using SCALPEL and the next three in the\ntraditional lab. Demonstrators were present in the lab and in the computer rooms where\nthe SCALPEL practicals were held in the normal timetabled slots.\nEducational attainment (ability to recall and apply subject domain knowledge) was\nmeasured by examination using MCQ (one mark for right answer, minus one for wrong\nanswer), and short-answer tests. These examinations were taken by all 159 students after\nthe first .three practicals and after all practicals were completed. Questionnaires were\nadministered before the start of the first practical, at the end of their final practical using\nSCALPEL and after all practicals were completed.\n45\nMichael Kemp et at From classroom tutor to hypertext adviser: an evaluation\nThe important outcomes of this evaluation were that there was no relationship between\neducational attainment as measured and the method used for study. Both groups of\nstudents scored similar marks at the crossover and at the end, and the marks at the end\nwere an improvement on the marks at the crossover point. Acceptance of SCALPEL was\ndistributed evenly around 'Neutral' and no significant relationship was found between\neducational attainment and acceptance of SCALPEL.\nOther important results were that the students expressed a strong preference for\nmaintaining the presence of demonstrators in the labs when using SCALPEL, and that\nthere was a weak negative relationship between those that expressed a need for\ndemonstrators and expressed acceptance of SCALPEL (that is, those who did not enjoy\nSCALPEL were more inclined to need demonstrators). These results were further\nemphasized by the focus groups.\nNo significant relationships were discovered between students grouped by demographics,\nlearning styles or previous exposure to computers, and their acceptance of SCALPEL or\ntheir educational attainment.\nObservations indicated that the dynamics of the lab sessions changed with the introduction\nof SCALPEL. The labs were quiet and the students worked mostly alone, although small\nad-hoc groups of two or three students might form to discuss a problem occasionally.\nDemonstrators were observed moving around the lab to deal with individual queries rather\nthan groups, and as a consequence often answered the same question many times. Few\nproblems were observed with the software although in their first session it was noticed that\nsome students took a while to learn the importance of closing a window after finishing\nwith its contents.\nDoing away with demonstrators: the second evaluation\nIn spite of the strength of feeling expressed by the students in the first trial concerning the\nneed for demonstrator assistance, the team were encouraged by the results showing no\nchange in educational attainment, and decided to continue the experiment by using\nSCALPEL without demonstrators.\nFor the second trial, all students were asked to complete the six case studies using\nSCALPEL. The work was self-paced, meaning they could do it when they liked as no\ndemonstrators would be present in the computer rooms anyway, but tutorials would still be\nrun at the set times and would cover the points that were raised from the last practical that\nthey were expected to have completed.\nThe important feature of this evaluation was the attempt to discover the methods that\nstudents used to solve problems they encountered during practicals. They were asked to\nnote the number of times they would have liked to have consulted a demonstrator, why\nthey wanted to consult a demonstrator, and how they eventually answered their question\n(whether they used the text book, lecture notes, resources within SCALPEL, asked a\nstudent, asked a member of staff, asked in tutorial, or whether they never did answer their\nquestion).\nFigure 4 below shows the variation of expressed need for demonstrators during SCALPEL\nsessions, and it is clear that year by year the students showed less need for demonstrators,\n46\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nin spite of the fact, that in Year 2 at least, nothing had been done to compensate for their\nabsence. This effect is discussed more fully below.\nIt was clear that the reasons for wishing to consult a demonstrator were nearly all\nconcerned with the pathology content of the practicals and very rarely to do with\nprocedural issues or operation of the software.\nFigure 2 shows the methods students used to solve their problems. Text books, tutorial\ndialogue and peer dialogue are clearly important. Staff were rarely consulted, and the use\nof the SCALPEL courseware materials is small, indicating that students did not think it\nlikely that answers to their questions would be discovered online.\n60 i\n50 -\n5 40 -\n|\n\"S 30\n20\n10\ni\n\\ \u2022 1\n\/ \\ :\n'\/ V\nPathology\nHistology\nAims and Objectives\nMCQ Engine\nSCALPEL FireBonality\nFigure 2: Methods\nused by students to\nsolve problems in the\nabsence of\ndemonstrators\nStudents were also asked to suggest how SCALPEL might be improved by ranking the\nfollowing and by making further suggestions:\n\u2022 glossary of terms;\n\u2022 online text books;\n\u2022 ability to ask questions online and get answers;\n\u2022 on line Notepad;\n\u2022 more links to background material;\n\u2022 optional extra practicals;\n\u2022 more animations;\n\u2022 sound clips to introduce sections, such as patient histories.\nStudents were clear that their preferred improvements to the SCALPEL courseware would\ninvolve putting text books online, providing rich linking to the new online materials and\nthe ability to ask questions online. These results were confirmed in focus groups; students\n47\nMichael Kemp et al From classroom tutor to hypertext adviser: an evaluation\nshowed little interest in the introduction of multimedia gizmos, in spite of the fact that a\nfew high-quality examples had been created to demonstrate the sort of material that was\nenvisaged.\nIntroducing a hypertext adviser: the third evaluation\nThe importance of dialogue with peers and teachers is well documented (see, for example,\nLaurillard, 2001; Schank and Clearly, 1995; Mayes, 1995). In the earlier versions of\nSCALPEL the only way that the system entered into any dialogue with the student was via\nthe MCQ engine, which asked the student questions and gave them some feedback on their\nanswers. Clearly this is limited by the fact that the subject of the dialogue is decided by the\nsystem and there is no opportunity for the students to ask their own questions. The fact\nthat students were allowed to carry out the SCALPEL practicals at the time of their choice\nruled out the use of synchronous communication methods for online dialogue, as there\nwere unlikely to be any staff or many students online at a convenient moment. On the\nother hand, there has been much work recently on the part that asynchronous\ncommunication can play in providing tutorial support and dialogue (such as Masterton,\n1998; Stratfold, 1998). Many of these approaches are based on work on 'Answer Gardens'\n(Ackerman and Malone, 1990). In this approach students pose questions, and the answers\nto these questions are collected in a kind of extended FAQ, organized by topic so that\nstudents can locate areas of similar questions to their own. As more questions are posed\nand answered, the answer garden grows.\nThe final experiment set out to discover whether the introduction of a richer environment\nsupported by an online 'demonstrator agent' would improve attitudes to SCALPEL. In\nthis experiment all 165 students completed the same six practicals, but an experimental\ngroup of 40 volunteers were given additional access to an enhanced MCQ engine which\nprovided access to the demonstrator agent. Of these, 28 students from the experimental\ngroup and 46 from the control group returned questionnaires.\nFigure 3 shows a typical screen shot of the demonstrator agent in use. The student wishes\nto answer question 2, but has a question. The demonstrator agent is aware of the context\n(the question the student is trying to answer) and is therefore able to list all other questions\nthat have previously been asked in this context (as well as offering the student the\nopportunity to consult other contexts). In the example the student has selected to see the\nanswer to one of these questions. Alternatively the student could have submitted a new\nquery. This would have been answered in due course by a domain expert, and thus added to\nthe list of previously asked questions. In this way the answer garden grows.\nIn the example the student has read the answer, but is perhaps not clear of the exact\nmeaning of one of the terms that is used in the answer, so has pressed the Show Links\nbutton. This has sent a query to Microcosm asking it to show any links it has in its\ndatabase which are anchored on terms which appear in the answer to the question. The\nscreenshot shows Microcosm returning with two links to background materials (in this\ncase a glossary of terms, but it might have been an online text book) that might be useful.\nThe results of the evaluation were encouraging. Figure 4 shows the decreasing need that\nstudents as a whole show for consulting demonstrators. This was directly linked to a year\nby year improvement in the acceptance of SCALPEL.\n48\nALT-J Volume 10 Number 3\nf\/gure 3: Screenshot of\nSCALPEL'S demonstrator\nagent in use\nFigure 4: Students'\nexpressed need for\ndemonstrators\nduring SCALPEL\nsessions\nPathology\nHistology\nAims and Objectives\nMCQ Engine\nnality\nIt is not clear why this year on year improvement occurred. One possible interpretation is\nthat in the late 1990s computers were becoming increasingly widespread (this was\nconfirmed in their responses to questions about previous exposure) and in particular the\nWeb was becoming a standard source of reference. A generation of students brought up\nwith expectations of learning from and referring to online materials is more likely to find\ncourseware acceptable.\n49\nMichael Kemp et at From classroom tutor to hypertext adviser: an evaluation\nThere was little difference between the experimental group and the control group in the\nreasons expressed for wishing to consult a demonstrator. However, the control group\nexpressed an average need of seven demonstrator consults per student compared with an\naverage of five per student for the experiment group.\n\u2022\u2022Pathology\n-Histology\n\u2022Aims and Objectives\n\u2022-MCO Engine\n-SCALPEL Functionality\nFigure 5: How the\ncontrol group solved\nproblems\nPathology\nHistology\nAims and Objectives\nMCQ Engine\nSCALPEL Functionality\nFigure 6: How the group with access to the demonstrator agent solved problems\n50\nALT-} Volume 10 Number 3\nThe pattern for solving problems changed considerably as shown in Figures 5 and 6. In\nparticular we see that the SCALPEL courseware becomes much more used, questions to\nmembers of staff become used a little (by submitting questions via the agent) and the\nnumber of questions never solved is considerably reduced.\nThere was a significant improvement in attitude to the use of SCALPEL recorded by those\nwho had access to the demonstrator agent. This is attributed to a reduction in the average\nnumber of required demonstrator consults relative to the control group, and an increase in\nproblems solved as a consequence of the demonstrator agent facilitating the resolution of\nmisconceptions with the pathology material.\nConclusions\nThis series of evaluation experiments has demonstrated that there was no significant\nchange in student learning as the result of replacing traditional labs with virtual labs, even\nwith the earliest group who were most averse to using courseware.\nAn unexpected result of this work was the fact that, over the three years, the first-year\nstudents were increasingly accepting of the use of courseware and found it less important to\nconsult demonstrators. This was independent of any changes we made in the courseware. It is\npossible that this effect could be in some way linked to the reducing percentage of students\nthat answered the surveys, but is more probably a reflection of the way society is changing.\nOver the period of this study in the late 1990s PCs, and in particular the Web and email,\nbecame standard tools for most educated citizens of. the UK, and as a consequence the\nstudents were more accustomed to reading, learning from and interacting with computers.\nIn spite of the general improvement in acceptance of courseware, there was a general\npreference for access to demonstrators. This is not surprising; models of learning based on\nconstructivist views (Brown, Metz and Campione, 1996) and conversational frameworks\n(Laurillard, 2001) would lead one to expect that removing demonstrator assistance would\nlead to poorer learning, as reported by our students. The encouraging result was that the\nacceptance of the use of courseware was significantly improved by the reintroduction of a\nrelatively simple software agent, which provided limited dialogue via an answer garden and\ndynamic access to suitable in-context links.\nIt is testament to the success of this work that all pathology practicals at the University of\nSouthampton were subsequently delivered to students through the SCALPEL\nenvironment.\nReferences\nAckerman, M.
