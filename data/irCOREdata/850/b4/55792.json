The model indicates a \nsignificant role for climate, but the direction of association is counter to expectation: butterfly \npopulation density is higher on sites with a cooler climate. However, the effect is highly \nheterogeneous, with one in five species displaying a net positive association. We use this \nmodel to project the population-level effects of climate warming for the year 2080, using a \nmedium emissions scenario. The results suggest that most populations and species will decline \nmarkedly, but that the total number of butterflies will increase as communities become \ndominated by a few common species. In particular, Maniola jurtina is predicted to make up \nnearly half of all butterflies on UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) transects by 2080. \nThese results contradict the accepted wisdom that most insect populations will grow as the \nclimate becomes warmer. Indeed, our predictions contrast strongly with those derived from \ninter-annual variation in abundance, emphasizing that we lack a mechanistic understanding \nabout the factors driving butterfly population dynamics over large spatial and temporal scales. \nOur study underscores the difficulty of predicting future population trends and reveals the \nnaivety of simple space-for-time substitutions, which our projections share with species \ndistribution modelling. \nIntroduction \nClimate change is now well-established as a major threat to biodiversity (Thomas et al. \n2004) and species distributions are changing in a manner consistent with climate change \n(Hickling et al. 2006, Hitch and Leberg 2007). The most common way of predicting the effects \nof climate change is using species distribution modelling (also known as climate envelope or \nniche modelling, Guisan and Thuiller 2005, Araujo and Guisan 2006).  \nDistribution modelling works by mapping species patterns of spatial occurrence from a \ngeographic to environmental space (the niche). The correlation between environmental \ngradients (especially temperature) is then used to predict the species distribution under some \nprojected future combination of climate. The core assumption is that similar mechanisms \noperate across space and across time (the space-for-time substitution). Niche (bioclimate) \nmodels are increasingly the primary tool for identifying the risks of climate change and \ninforming future conservation policy for biodiversity (Thomas et al. 2004), and specifically \nbutterflies (Settele et al. 2008), in spite of criticism that they generally ignore population \nbiology or biotic interactions (Araujo and Luoto 2007). \nProjections based on population time series are much less common (Roy et al. 2001), \nreflecting the limited taxonomic coverage of high-quality monitoring data. Time series \nprojections make predictions about changes in population abundance (as opposed to species \ndistributions), and therefore provide a more ecologically meaningful measure of biodiversity \nchange.  However, parameterization of such models is intensive and may be impractical for \nlarge numbers of species. \nIn this paper, we use the spatial pattern of population abundance to make predictions \nabout the population-level effects of climate change. We employ a space-for-time substitution \nto project changes in abundance among nearly 10000 populations from sites in the UK \nButterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). We compare our results with the time-based \npopulation model of Roy et al. (2001). The results allow us to test the robustness of the space-\nfor-time substitution, and provide novel insights into the practice of using niche models to \npredict the effects of climate change. \nMethods \nButterfly data \nWe measured butterfly population abundance as the geometric mean \u2018site index\u2019 for the \nyears 2002-6, excluding sites that were surveyed only once during the 5-year period and also \nsite-species combinations in which butterflies were never observed in more than one week of \nthe year. We divided these abundance indices by the transect length, in order to derive an \nestimate of population density. The resulting dataset contains 9991 populations (site-by-species \ncombinations) representing 46 species and 520 sites. \nModel of butterfly abundance \nIsaac et al. (in prep) infer a role for climate in butterfly abundance using multi-model \ninference (Burnham and Anderson 2002) and linear mixed effects models (Bolker et al. 2009). \nTheir models describe the correlates of butterfly population density for these 9991 populations, \nand include site traits (climate, topography, site management), species traits (measures of life \nhistory and niche breadth) and population traits (position in range) as predictor variables. Isaac \net al. measured climatic conditions on UKBMS sites using two axes from a principal \ncomponents analysis of 10 climate variables. The first principal component, which was not \nimportant in explaining butterfly abundance, was highly correlated with several rainfall \nmeasures. The second principal component of climatic variation was implicated as important in \ndetermining butterfly abundance: this axis was highly correlated with measures of site \ntemperature (mean annual temperature, mean temperature of the coldest month, mean \ntemperature of the warmest month, growing degree days). \nWe first fitted a model containing the five most important predictor variables in the \ncandidate set of models considered by Isaac et al (in prep). In addition to climate, these were \nbutterfly species richness (of the site), larval growth rate and distributional extent (both species \ntraits) and position in range (a population trait). We then refitted this model with site mean \nannual temperature instead of the principal component, which lead to a substantial \nimprovement in model fit (\u2202AIC=9). Mean annual temperature estimates were derived from \ngridded data on long term monthly temperature records (New et al. 1999, Mitchell and Jones \n2005) interpolated to 10km resolution (Oliver et al. 2009). Removing mean annual temperature \nfrom the model lead to a substantially worse fit (\u2202AIC=12.9, 2=14.9, df=1, p=0.0001), thus \nconfirming the correlation between temperature and abundance.  \nWe further adapted this model to test whether the response to temperature is \nheterogeneous among species by fitting a model in which temperature appears in the random \npart of the model (a random slopes model). In this model, the abundance-temperature \nrelationship is different for each species and is assumed to follow a normal distribution: the \nestimated parameters are the mean and variance of this distribution. Standard model \ncomparison was used to test whether the random slopes model is a significant improvement \nover the simple model, in which the temperature response is fixed across all species. Following \nEnders & Tofighi (2007), we used temperature data centred on zero for each species, in order \nto avoid spurious correlations. We extracted the species-specific slopes (i.e. the abundance- \ntemperature relationships) from this model (following Isaac and Carbone 2010) and used them \nfor further analyses. \nWe conducted all analyses using the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2008) in R (R \nDevelopment Core Team 2008). \nFuture climate \nWe used UK Climate Projections (Defra 2010) for mean annual temperature (median \nestimate) for the year 2080 based on a moderate emissions scenario SRES A1 B (IPCC 2007), \nwhich envisions a balance between fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. The A1 storyline \nand scenario family describe a world of rapid economic growth, with a peak in global \npopulation around 2050 and the rapid introduction of efficient new technologies. Major \nunderlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity building and increased cultural \nand social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita \nincome. This scenario predicts that mean annual temperatures in 2080 will be up to 3.6 C \nwarmer than present in southern England, and around 2.8 C warmer in northern England. \nThe data for climate projections is gridded with a resolution of 25km. We matched 477 \nUKBMS sites to the relevant grid cell in the climate projections dataset. We excluded 43 \ncoastal sites that fell outside the grid extent for climate projections, including all five UKBMS \nsites of Thymelicus acteon. Our projected abundance dataset therefore covers 9075 populations \nrepresenting 45 species and 477 sites. \nPredicted abundance under climate change \nWe derived predicted abundance for each of our 9075 populations by using the species-\nspecific temperature response, the site-specific temperature change and the current abundance \n(geometric mean for the years 2002-6). For each species, we summed both current and \npredicted future abundance across all sites; for each site, we summed across species. These \nvalues estimate the total number of butterflies for each species and each site, for both 2002-6 \nand 2080. We then expressed the difference between time periods as a percentage change in \nabundance. \nResults \nThe overall relationship between mean annual temperature and butterfly density is \nweak but generally negative (figure 1). Before accounting for variation among species, the \nparameter estimate is \u20130.178, which means that a rise of 1 C in mean annual temperature is \naccompanied by a drop in abundance of (1-e\n-0.178\n=) 16.3%. \nAfter accounting for variation among species (the random slopes model), the mean \neffect of temperature is estimated to be slightly steeper, at \u20130.213, corresponding to a drop in \nabundance of 19.2% for each degree rise in mean annual temperature. However, standard \ndeviation in species\u2019 temperature responses (0.265) is large compared with the mean, \nindicating that a substantial proportion of species (20%) are more abundant at warmer sites \n(table 1). This random slopes model with species-specific temperature responses represents a \nsubstantial improvement in fit over the simpler model containing a single slope (\u2202AIC=102, \n2\n=106, df=2, p<0.0001), supporting the hypothesis that species respond differently to \ntemperature.  \nNeither the mean temperature response nor the variance among species is substantially \naltered by removing the other non-species traits (richness and position in range) from the \nmodel. We also repeated our model comparison after excluding the five extreme sites with \nmean annual temperature below 8 C and found the results were qualitatively unchanged. \nCombining the species-specific temperature responses with site-specific predictions for \nclimate warming by 2080 yielded projected changes in abundance for 9075 butterfly \npopulations. These ranged from \u201393% to +71%, with a mean of \u201326% and median of \u201336%. \nHowever, the predicted change in total abundance (i.e. weighting each population by present \nabundance) is +21%. In other words, although most populations are predicted to decline, the \ntotal number of butterflies on UKBMS sites in England is predicted to rise. \nProjected change in species abundance under climate change varies from \u201392% \n(Argynnis aglaja) to +68% (Maniola jurtina). However, species are distributed bimodally \nthrough this range (figure 2), with a median projected change of \u201350%. Sites cover a similar \nrange, but a small majority are predicted to gain butterflies (figure 2): the median change is \n+0.5%. There is no obvious pattern to the spatial distribution of predicted change among sites: \nmany sites predicted to suffer heavy losses are in close proximity to others that we predict will \ngain butterflies (figure 3). The variation in space reflects both turnover in community \ncomposition and local variation in the (current) abundance of individual species. The apparent \ncontradiction between site and species projections is explained by the response of just two \nspecies, Gatekeeper Pyronia tithonus and Meadow Brown Maniola jurtina. These are the two \ncommonest species on UKBMS transects in England, and both are projected to increase in \nabundance by over 50% (table 1). Our model suggests that Maniola jurtina, which currently \nmakes up 29% of butterflies on UKBMS sites in England, will make up 48% of the total by \n2080. Comparable figures for Pyronia tithonus are 12% and 15%. The 50% rarest species \ncurrently contribute 1 in 21 observations on the UKBMS: by 2080 this rate is projected to fall \nto 1 in 41 (data from table 1). \nDiscussion \nOur results suggest substantial future declines in the abundance of most UK butterfly \nspecies due to climate change. Our models predict that climate warming will lead to the \nincreased domination of butterfly communities by a few generalist species, providing another \nexample of biotic homogenisation (Keith et al. 2009, Pino et al. 2009, Ekroos et al. 2010). \nTaken at face value, these findings present a worrying picture for butterfly conservation and \nimply that conservation priorities should be reassessed urgently. \nThere are several reasons to suspect the predictions of our models are at best \nincomplete, or at worst misleading. First and foremost, our model describes patterns of \npopulation density in narrow strips on occupied sites, completely ignoring patterns of site \noccupancy and changes therein. Measuring density over larger spatial scales, incorporating \nunoccupied sites, might lead to a different set of conclusions (see Cowley et al. 2001a). \nChanges in occupancy over time are equally important: most UK butterflies are continuing to \ndecline in their distributions (Warren et al. 2001, Fox et al. 2006), and future population \nextinctions would be in addition to the losses predicted here. However, 29% of species are \nincreasing (Fox et al. 2006), and for these species any losses in abundance predicted here might \nbe offset by colonization of previously unoccupied sites. A second important caveat is that our \npredictions are based solely on changes in temperature, ignoring other variables in the model \nthat might conceivably change, notably position in range and species richness. Both of these \ntraits would be affected by changes in species\u2019 distributions and both had much larger effects \non butterfly abundance than did temperature. Moreover, seasonal shifts and changes in site \nmanagement are probably more important than the crude index of mean annual temperature \nused here. We were also unable to model changes in microclimatic availability, which may \nshow quite different patterns to mean annual temperature (Wallisdevries and Van Swaay \n2006). Finally, we must question the correlation from which our predictions were generated. \nThe negative relationship between abundance and temperature is highly counter-intuitive: \nclimate warming is generally assumed to benefit ectotherms such as butterflies (Warren et al. \n2001). UK butterflies are reported to be expanding their range margins northwards in response \nto climate change (Hickling et al. 2006) and most species are more abundant in warmer years \n(Roy et al. 2001). Why then, for most species, are there more butterflies in sites where it\u2019s \ncolder? \nThree broad classes of explanation exist for the generally negative relationship between \nabundance and temperature. One is that basal metabolic rates of ectothermic animals increase \nexponentially with temperature (Gillooly et al. 2001), so that more energy is required for each \nindividual to remain alive. This means that energy supply (i.e. food availability) must rise with \nincreasing temperature in order to sustain the same number of individuals (Brown et al. 2004). \nAll other things being equal, metabolic theory therefore predicts the negative correlation \nbetween population density and temperature that we have observed (Storch 2003). For the \nrange of mean annual temperatures across England, each degree rise in temperature raises \nindividual metabolic rates by 9% (Gillooly et al. 2001), thus accounting for much of the 16-\n19% drop in abundance suggested by our models. However, the rise in temperature (in space or \nin time) is likely accompanied by longer growing seasons and greater primary productivity, \nthus offsetting the increase in individual metabolic requirements. \nA second explanation is that abundance is mediated by natural enemies. It seems likely \nthat most insects experience high rates of parasitism and disease (Roy et al. 2009), although \nfew specific case studies for butterflies have been described (Revels 2006). The abundance and \nspecies richness of natural enemies probably declines with latitude (Rosenzweig 1995), such \nthat butterflies on colder sites in northern England experience much lower exposure to natural \nenemies than those in the south (Menendez et al. 2008, Gaston 2009). If abundance in the \nabsence of natural enemies (i.e. carrying capacity) is independent of temperature then a \nnegative relationship would be observed with mean abundance, on account of including sites \nand years with high mortality. However, this would imply smaller inter-annual fluctuations in \npopulation size at colder sites, which is the opposite to that reported for the majority of species \non the UKBMS (Thomas et al. 1994). However, the role of natural enemies on mean butterfly \npopulation size would be testable with comparative data on parasite load at multiple sites. \nFinally, it is possible that the apparent correlation between abundance and temperature \nis an artefact of changes in occupancy and niche breadth with latitude. Most UK butterflies \napproach their northern range boundaries in the UK, and occupancy (measured as proportion of \ngrid cells) is typically lower near the margins than in the centre of the species range (Gaston \n2003, Fox et al. 2006). We also know that niche breadth in UK butterflies declines towards \nspecies\u2019 range margins (Oliver et al. 2009). These two observations suggest that butterfly \npopulations near range margins are restricted to favoured biotopes: sites that would be suitable \nin warmer climates are unoccupied (see also Cowley et al. 2001b, Paivinen et al. 2005). If \nnotional carrying capacity is biotope-specific but unrelated to climate then the relationship \nbetween mean density and temperature would be triangular, with both high- and low-density \npopulations in the warmer south but only high-density populations in the colder north. Such \nheterogeneity is evident in the residual distribution for four species Aglais urticae, \nCoenonympha pamphilus, Vanessa atalanta and V. cardui, but does not appear to be a general \nphenomenon. Further investigation into the relationship between occupancy, temperature, \nniche breadth and density, at a range of spatial scales, is therefore to be encouraged. \nOur predictions contrast strongly with those of Roy et al. (2001), who found that most \nbutterfly species increased in abundance (measured as the national index) during warm years. \nThese correlations had low power to predict subsequent population trends for most species, but \nfor eight species the correlations were sufficiently strong to permit projections for abundance \ntrends under climate warming up to the year 2080. Six species were predicted to increase, one \ndecrease (Pieris brassicae) and one to remain approximately stable (Lasiommata megera). Of \nthese species, we predict two species to increase (Pieris brassicae and Pyronia tithonus) and \nsix to decline: i.e. seven out of eight predictions are in the opposite direction! The results of \nRoy et al. (2001) are quite intuitive: butterflies are more abundant in warm years because of \nlower winter mortality, rapid development and higher plant biomass. Moreover, Roy & Sparks \n(2000) reported rapid changes in butterfly life cycles in response to recent climate warming \n(e.g. advanced eclosion of adult butterflies, extended flight seasons, increased propensity for \nmultivoltinism), all suggesting generally positive population responses to warming. The time-\nbased population model of Roy et al (2001) was based on fine-scale climatic data (e.g. specific \nmonths related to the butterfly life cycle), that would be difficult to generalise to large numbers \nof species. The approach described here, whilst lacking certain subtleties of butterfly ecology, \nhas the advantage that it could be applied to any situation where there is spatial data on \npopulation density. \nAlthough the explanation for our negative temperature-abundance relationship remains \nelusive, our results demonstrate clearly that different processes operate across space and over \ntime. Put bluntly, we lack a mechanistic understanding about the drivers of butterfly population \ndynamics over large spatial and temporal scales. Without such knowledge, it is speculative to \nextrapolate from current patterns into the future. This message is profoundly important for \ninterpreting the climate projections of niche models (Guisan and Thuiller 2005, Araujo and \nGuisan 2006), which share with our study the simple assumption that patterns in space are \nstatic, and can be used as a substitute for patterns in time. In this case we are fortunate that \ntime-series information is available to verify our projections. Unfortunately, such reality \nchecks are unavailable for the vast majority of modelling exercises. \nNiche (bioclimate) models assume phenotypic plasticity of populations and constant \nresponses across a species\u2019 entire range (Berry et al. 2002).  However, evidence of widespread \nadaptation of butterfly populations to local climates is accumulating (Van Dyck and Wilding \n2009) and gradients in butterfly biology along climatic gradients are well known (Nylin 2009).  \nMany butterflies occurring towards their cooler range limit shift to inhabit warmer, narrower \nniches, whereas with core populations sample the landscape more widely (Thomas 1993, \nThomas et al. 1999, Cowley et al. 2001b, Roy and Thomas 2003, Oliver et al. 2009).  Other \nstudies report gradients in size or melanism in butterflies across latitudes (Dennis and Shreeve \n1989, Nylin and Svard 1991, Ayres and Scriber 1994). A fuller assessment of the extent of \nlocal adaptations within populations is therefore essential for more accurate predictions of the \nimpacts of climate warming on biodiversity and the ecosystem services they support (Visser \n2008), particularly for species with low dispersal ability. \nAcknowledgments \nWe are indebted to the hundreds of volunteers who collect data on the UKBMS.
