INTRODUCTION \nT is well known that the tree structure filter bank shown in \nfigure 1b can be represented via an octave decomposition \nfilter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} shown in figure 1a, \nand perfect reconstruction can be achieved if and only if each \nbranch of the tree structure achieves perfect reconstruction \n[1]-[4]. However, is the converse true? That is, given any \nperfect reconstruction octave decomposition filter bank with set \nof decimators {2,4,4} shown in figure 1a, can it be represented \nvia a tree structure shown in figure 1b? In general, a perfect \nreconstruction non-uniform filter bank cannot be represented \nby a tree structure [11], [12]. This letter works on the problem \nof representing a perfect reconstruction octave decomposition \nfilter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} by a tree structure. \nThere are some advantages of representing an octave \ndecomposition filter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} via a \ntree structure, such as reducing the filter length in the filters \n[5], and improving the computation complexity and \nimplementation speed [5]. In section II, we show how a perfect \nreconstruction octave decomposition filter bank with set of \ndecimators {2,4,4} can be converted to a tree structure filter \nbank. Some illustrative examples are demonstrated in section \nIII. Finally, a conclusion is given in section IV. \n \nManuscript received June 19, 2002; revised September 17, 2002.

Hence, the octave decomposition filter bank with \nset of decimators {2,4,4} shown in figure 1a can be represented \nvia a tree structure shown in figure 1b. \nBecause the input-output behavior of these two \nrepresentations remains unchanged, so if the octave \ndecomposition filter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} \nachieves perfect reconstruction, the tree structure filter bank \ndoes also. Hence, it completes the proof. \uf06e \nFor the design of the synthesis filters in an octave \ndecomposition filter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4}, if that \nfilter bank system achieves perfect reconstruction, it is proved \nin Theorem 1 that it can be represented by a tree-structure filter \nbank and that tree-structure filter bank achieves perfect \nreconstruction. The synthesis filters in a tree-structure filter \nbank for the perfect reconstruction can be designed easily [7], \nand those filters in the tree-structure filter bank can be \ntransformed to the filters in an octave decomposition filter bank \nwith set of decimators {2,4,4}. Hence, the synthesis filters in an \noctave decomposition filter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} \ncan be designed. \n \nIII. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES \nA. Non-tree Structure Filter Bank \nConsider an example of \uf028 \uf029 10 1 \uf02d\uf02b\uf03d zzH , \uf028 \uf029 11 1 \uf02d\uf02d\uf03d zzH , \nand \uf028 \uf029 22 \uf02d\uf03d zzH , respectively. Since \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0291221 1 \uf02d\uf02d\uf0d7\uf03d zzzHzH , there do not exist \uf028 \uf029zF1\uf0a2 , \n\uf028 \uf029zF0 , and \uf028 \uf029zF1  such that \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0292011 zFzFzH \uf0d7\uf0a2\uf03d and \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0292112 zFzFzH \uf0d7\uf0a2\uf03d , respectively. Hence, this octave \ndecomposition filter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} cannot \nbe represented via a tree structure. By Theorem 1, this octave \ndecomposition filter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} does \nnot achieve perfect reconstruction. \nIt is worth to note that by converting the octave \ndecomposition filter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} to a \nuniform filter bank shown in figure 2 [6]-[10], perfect \nreconstruction can be achieved. However, \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029zGzzG 021 \uf0a2\uf0d7\uf0b9\uf0a2 \uf02d\uf02d . This implies that the corresponding \nsynthesis filter \uf028 \uf029zG 0  shown in figure 1a is time varying. \nB. Tree Structure Filter Bank \nConsider another example with \uf028 \uf029 10 1 \uf02d\uf02b\uf03d zzH , \n\uf028 \uf029 3211 1 \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d zzzzH , and \uf028 \uf029 3212 1 \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d \uf02b\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d zzzzH , \nrespectively. Since \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0292221 11 \uf02d\uf02d \uf02d\uf02b\uf03d zzzHzH , there \nexist \uf028 \uf029zF1\uf0a2 , \uf028 \uf029zF0 , and \uf028 \uf029zF1  such that \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0292011 zFzFzH \uf0d7\uf0a2\uf03d and \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0292112 zFzFzH \uf0d7\uf0a2\uf03d , \nrespectively. Hence, this octave decomposition filter bank with \nset of decimators {2,4,4} can be represented via a tree \nstructure. It can be checked easily that each branch in the tree \nstructure can achieve perfect reconstruction. Hence, this octave \ndecomposition filter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} can \nachieve perfect reconstruction. \n \nIV. CONCLUSION \nIn this letter, we show that an octave decomposition filter \nbank with set of decimators {2,4,4} achieves perfect \nreconstruction if and only if it can be represented via a tree \nstructure and each branch of the tree structure achieves perfect \nreconstruction. The advantage of representing an octave \ndecomposition filter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} via a \ntree structure is to reduce the computation complexity and \nprovide a fast implementation for an octave decomposition \nfilter bank with set of decimators {2,4,4} [5]. \nREFERENCES \n[1] P.
