This question is made especially pertinent with the current\nexpansion of information technology into higher and further education. To know the cost-\neffectiveness of these initiatives, it is first necessary to gain some comprehension of the\ncosts involved. This must be done in a way that is comprehensible to everyone in academia.\nA recently completed research study undertaken by the authors addressed these problems.\nThe study, entitled Costs of Networked Learning (http:\/\/www.shu.ac.uk\/virtuaLcampus\/\ncnl\/), was funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee of the UK Funding\nCouncils (JISC). It ran over a six-month period (January to June 1999) based at Sheffield\nHallam University. The main aims of the study were to identify the unrecorded or hidden\ncosts involved in networked learning and to produce a planning document and financial\nschema to aid the development of networked learning activities. A lifecycle model was\n92\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\ndeveloped as a key component of the financial schema, in that it guides the user to\ndocument particular costs at particular stages of development. This paper describes the\ndevelopment of this lifecycle model.\nNetworked learning is taken to be synonymous with 'online learning' and 'technology\nenhanced learning'. Hidden costs are costs which appear somewhere in financial accounts\nbut are either unrecorded by the institution, such as personally incurred costs by staff or\nstudents, or absorbed into larger budgets without being attributed to an individual activity\nor process. Examples of hidden costs include:\n\u2022 increased telephone call bills for students due to Internet use to access lecture notes,\ncourse conferencing and assignments;\n\u2022 expenses incurred by academic staff at conferences which are not reimbursed by the\ninstitution;\n\u2022 use of research funds to bolster teaching resources - or vice versa.\nA wider definition of hidden costs includes such 'costs' as 'opportunity costs' - costs of\nstaff who could be deployed in a way different from their current use (for example,\nacademic staff who could carry out commercial-fee postgraduate teaching rather than\nundergraduate work). Our planning work in the study goes into this area when it considers\nalternative options and risk analysis; it also to an extent looks at non-financial choice\nfactors. However, such topics are not central to this paper.\nThe study is intended to inform the decisions made by institutional policy-makers and\ncourse providers planning networked learning initiatives. The outcomes of the study (the\nlifecycle model, planning document and financial schema) should be relevant to the needs\nof policy makers, managers, course providers and administrators. The model should be\neasily understandable by all these professionals. Hence, the lifecycle framework is strongly\ngrounded on what the people in academia are familiar with.\nThe paper describes the initial five-stage model based on an analysis of a literature review\nconducted during the early stages of the project, the testing and development of this\nmodel, and the evolution of the final model. The application of the model is illustrated in\nthe context of two hypothetical scenarios.\nThe initial model\nThe study team conducted an extensive literature review during the first phase of the\nproject. The aim of the review was twofold. Firstly, the team's understanding of the\n'costing of learning' (including distance learning and networked learning) was updated and\nextended. Secondly, 'cost items' mentioned by other authors were extracted. Over 100 cost\nitems were identified during the project, many of which do not usually exist as university\ncost codes. These can therefore be regarded as hidden costs, which are normally subsumed\ninto other, possibly unrelated, budgets. Examples of these include course-related access to\nthe Internet, creative design of materials, evaluation of bought-in materials, and the rollout\nof specialist software.\nPart of the project brief was to build a framework within which all of these cost items\ncould be documented. Therefore the team analysed currently available models that attempt\n93\nPaul Bacsich and Charlotte Ash Costing the lifecyde of networked learning\nto provide a framework for recording the costs of technology-enhanced learning systems.\nThere were initial concerns about the value of traditional institutional financial\nmanagement accounting procedures for exposing the full range of the hidden costs.\nTraditional methods typically do not provide detailed costs, especially with respect to\ncentral departments. In addition costs are usually expressed in departmental terms, rather\nthan project or activity terms. Despite these reservations, three traditional accounting\ninsights were useful:\n\u2022 Distinct organizations have separate budgets; in particular, university-borne costs are\ndistinct from student-borne costs.\n\u2022 There are fundamental accounting distinctions between people and things - between\nstaff and non-staff - and between capital and recurrent costs.\n\u2022 Organizations employ different kinds of people; specifically, in universities there are\nacademic and non-academic staff.\nIn addition, one modern insight is fundamental:\n\u2022 People do different kinds of tasks and the balance of their tasks changes even within\nthe accounting period - this is the basis of activity-based costing (ABC).\nUsing these four basic insights, the team embarked on an analysis of the educational\ncosting literature, concentrating upon their classification of costs. A summary of this\nreview follows.\nA categorization of costs associated with educational media which mixes activities with\nstandard accounting categories is given by Orivel (1987): administration costs, production\ncosts, diffusion costs and reception centres. Rumble (1989) believes costs can be classified\nas human resource costs; costs of developing, producing and delivering; capital equipment\ncosts; consumables and expenses; and space and accommodation costs. This blurs the\nboundaries between staff and non-staff costs, and between capital and recurrent costs. It\nseems that Rumble is addressing the issue from a university planning perspective rather\nthan taking a university accounting viewpoint. Cukier (1997) follows in similar vein to\nRumble by categorizing the costs of educational technology as human resources, general\nadministration, development; production and delivery, capital equipment and start-up,\nconsumables and expenses and space and accommodation. This appears to mix fixed costs\nwith variable costs, and capital costs with recurring costs.\nCrabb (1990) and Moonen (1997) propose phase-related descriptions of cost categories.\nMoonen (1997) summarizes costs as personnel costs, equipment costs, facilities costs,\nmaterial costs and other costs. These are calculated in a 'costs per activity phase'\nbreakdown of a development phase and a delivery, operation and maintenance phase.\nMoonen has clearly separated costs into terms understandable to finance administrators\nand has also produced a lifecycle model. However, it is clear from a more detailed reading\nthat he is considering the lifecycle of the course, not that of its supporting infrastructure.\nTwo stages of development and delivery are used by Crabb, leading to categories of human\nresources, premises-related costs, equipment, consumables and expenses, central resources,\nand overheads. Although there are still deficiencies in light of the specific areas the study\n94\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nwas addressing (such as evaluation), Crabb presents a coherent accounting framework\nwhich can be developed further.\nThe approaches analysed in the literature review were not strong in their ability to identify\nhidden costs. All suffered from one or more of the following weaknesses:\n\u2022 Students are not considered either in terms of their income or of their expenditure.\n\u2022 Staff are not considered, except as employees of the institution.\n\u2022 Courses grow from nowhere and vanish into oblivion - the models on the whole do not\ntake planning, evaluation and maintenance into account.\n\u2022 There is no obvious connection between a learning module and the environment in\nwhich it is studied.\nIt was concluded that existing models were implausible in terms of documenting hidden\ncosts and\/or unsuited to the UK higher education sector. Therefore, a number of short\nconsultative meetings were held with selected academics at the Sheffield Hallam University\nto discuss the lifecycle of course development and delivery and the issue of hidden costs.\nBased on these discussions, the varying experience of the study team in different areas, and\nthe desire to illustrate the relationship between people and activities and therefore expose\npossible areas of hidden costs, a new 'five-phase, three stakeholder' working model was\ncreated. This is shown in Figure 1.\nFigure \/: Initial five-\nphase model\nDevelop ing\ntie leasing\nexpuioct\/\nMaintaining\nthe leaning\nexperienced\n95\nPaul Baaich and Charlotte Ash Costing the lifecyde of networked learning\nFigure 1 shows the five phases each lifecycle passes through: from initial planning, through\ndeveloping, providing, managing, and maintaining; to further planning and on again\nthrough the cycle (as illustrated by the large arrows). The three groups of stakeholders -\nacademic staff, support staff and students - are influenced by other stakeholders (as shown\nby the small arrows); and different stakeholders are involved at different stages of the\nprocess (as represented by the lines forming a pentagon).\nTesting and development\nThe five-phase model was subjected to a two-stage testing process. In the first stage,\nparticipants at interviews conducted during seven institutional case studies (see later for\nmore details) were questioned about various aspects of the model. In the second stage, a\nsmall workshop was held to instigate discussion between a number of experts in the area\n(both in costing and in online learning), from the educational and the industrial training\nsectors. The purpose of such thorough testing was to assess the viability of the model in a\nsector where it is commonly accepted that staff are antipathetic to imposed methods of\nworking. The model needs to resonate with academic working reality rather than impose\nan impractical strait-jacket.\nTest group one\nOne of the main components of the study was to assess the extent of networked learning in\nUK higher education institutions by examining how these activities were costed, if at all. Seven\ninstitutions were selected (on the basis of their replies to a sector-wide survey) to represent the\nsector, using such criteria as research or teaching bias, geographical split and current status of\nnetworked learning activities. Teams of interviewers visited the institutions over a two-day\nperiod and interviewed academics, administrators and senior management, often receiving an\nadditional tour of the facilities and activities taking place. Over fifty interviewees were shown a\ncopy of the working model and asked to comment on several aspects.\nGenerally, the response to the working model was positive. Staff were pleased to see course\nmaintenance and support staff being properly recognized in an educational setting. The\n'lifecycle' approach to the issue was also commended. One interviewee expressed the view\nthat simple methods have more impact on non-financially aware academics; however,\nanother considered that even in its simplest form, the model would .need serious staff\ntraining and 'hearts and minds buy-in' at a grass-roots level in order to succeed.\nHowever, there were some reservations. Staff in institutions thought that representation\nfrom senior management (deans and above) and evaluation should be included in the\nworking model. Others thought that more general issues, such as flexibility and\nsustainability, should be included. Still others believed that additional stakeholders, such as\nemployers and parents, should be incorporated. Some of the academic staff interviewed\nwere concerned that any framework of this nature may be too rigid, since organizational\nchange is slower than the pace of technology. Others believed that scenarios would be a\ngood way of illustrating its function. Further analysis revealed that most academics were\nnegative about the idea of a framework to document the costs of networked learning, while\nsenior management were in favour of a framework that would help record the costs of any\nlearning system. Much concern was expressed about whether such a model would stifle\ncreativity and innovation, thus hindering the development of networked learning.\n96\nALT-] Volume 8 Number I\nTest group two\nIn addition to the case study interviews, a workshop was held at Sheffield Hallam\nUniversity attended by several prominent educators and financial experts. The aims of the\nworkshop were to facilitate discussion on costing networked learning and to explore ideas\nthat would assist the study team in developing the project outcomes.\nThe experts agreed that the model should be equally appropriate for costing conventional\nteaching systems and for costing networked learning. If the model were not applicable to\nalternative systems, fair comparisons could not be made. This would leave the sector no\ncloser to determining whether, and in what circumstances, networked learning is more cost-\neffective than conventional teaching and learning. Relative costing was agreed to be more\nimportant than the issue of whether networked learning costs less in absolute terms.\nSome omissions in the model were identified. Strategic planning was noted to be missing,\nbut on discussion it was agreed that this should take place outside the existing model.\nQuality assurance and evaluation were also noted to be missing. Given the importance\nplaced on these within the current academic climate, it was decided that these two aspects\nneeded to be included in the model.\nFurther discussion on the model revealed that the industry-based experts were not\ncomfortable with the five-phase working model. They proposed a four-phase model that\n'helically' revolved through the following four phases: develop, market, provide and assure.\nHowever, the education-based experts were confident that universities would not accept the\nterminology and approach of the four-phase model and they also expressed worries that at\nleast one of the categories (assure) was too 'sparse' in its suggested meaning to justify its\nown phase.\nThe final model\nBoth test groups noted that there were a number of omissions from the working model;\nthese included evaluation, quality assurance and strategic planning. Another vital finding\nto arise from this testing process was that simple methods have more resonance with\nacademic staff, especially when they impact on costs, time and workload. The team decided\nto accept the view that the original five-phase model was too complex, but to reject the\nfour-phase business-derived model as unsuitable for documenting the hidden costs of\nnetworked learning within higher education. So, with the aim of combining simplicity with\nsuitably headed categories, a new three-phase model was proposed.\nThe new model includes evaluation and quality assurance but assumes that strategic\nplanning takes place on the periphery. Staff and students have been removed from the\nmodel, since it was decided, after much research and discussion with colleagues, that their\nplace is secure now that the stakeholder analysis approach is becoming more accepted in\neducational circles. It should be noted at this stage that even though the learning\nenvironment is no longer specifically stated, this model also works on this level. The three-\nphase model is shown in Figure 2. The three-phase model follows classic course planning\nframeworks from the distance education sector but also incorporates the increasingly\naccepted need for quality assurance and course maintenance.\n97\nPaul Bacsich and Charlotte Ash Costing the lifecyde of networked learning\nf\nMaintenance\nand\nEvaluation\nPlanning and\nDevelopment\n-\nTilH^Hlirr\"\n)\nProduction\nand :\nDelivery\nFigure 2: Three-phase model\nThe evolution from the five-phase to the three-phase model is shown in Table 1.

Thus, he includes the costs incurred by\nacademic staff and students. Moonen (1997) distinguishes two phases: a development\nphase and a production, delivery, operation and maintenance phase. We split his phase two\ninto two parts, leaving maintenance in the third phase.\nIt became apparent in the later stages of our study project that work on costing in the\ntraining sector was closely related to the ABC systems we were working towards. However,\nalthough workers in this sector were more in touch with both the costs incurred by staff\nand students and the growing opportunity cost of activities, their models proved no more\ncomprehensive than those above. Stahmer (1995) proposes a model of course development\ncomprising three phases: research and planning; development; and delivery. In this\ninstance, we group the first two together in our planning and development phase. Hunt and\nClarke (1997) have a four-phase model: research and development; initial investment;\noperation and support; and disposal and salvage. Again, we group phases one and two\ntogether. Phase four is rather odd, and hard at first sight to equate with ou\/ maintenance\nand evaluation. One could assume that they were thinking of courses delivered primarily\nby CD-ROM.\nIt is noteworthy that evaluation is not generally considered when the costing of a learning\nenvironment is undertaken. The other main issue is one of terminology: there is no\nconsensus across the board about the vocabulary one should use and no consistency in its\nuse. It is hoped that once a suitable model is agreed upon, developments should become\neasier to plan and execute.

Given the fictitious nature of the examples, the model is only used to identify\nactivities that will have hidden costs associated with them. No attempt is made to give\nprecise costs associated with these activities.\n99\nPaul Bacsich and Chortotte Ash Costing the lifecyde of networked learning\nThe first example is a 'conventional course':\nDr Albrecht of the University of Tynebridge was asked to teach a new final year course\non post-deconstructionism this academic year for one semester. It followed the standard\nform in his institution of a one-hour lecture and one-hour discussion group each week.\nHis lecture notes consisted of a topic list and a list of readings. The discussion group was\nmoderated in a lightweight way by him and needed little preparation. He had to mark\ntwo essays per student during the course. The class size was fifteen.\nTable 4 illustrates the application of the model:\nPhase Types of task\nPlanning and development\nProduction and delivery\nMaintenance and evaluation\nRead the latest works on the topic, listen to a new radio series, create lecture\nnotes (in Word), set essay topics.

RAE pressures mean that he would like to get his RA to\nwork as a TA to moderate the discussions. A particularly bright disabled\nstudent has asked to attend next year's course 'online' - what to do?\nTable 4: Application of the three-phase model to a 'conventional'course.\nThe second example is an online course:\nSensing a gap in the market, now that many arts graduates (e.g. at the BBC) have PCs\nand are on the Internet, Dr Carter at the University of Rother Bridge has approval to\nmount a totally online course on post-deconstructionism. This will be part of her new\ndistance learning MA on 'radical philosophies'.\nPhase Types of task\nPlanning and development Read the latest works on the topic, listen to a new radio series, create lecture\nnotes, set essay topics.

She refuses, citing the departmental overhead.)\nMake more material available on Web, such as topical items on philosophy,\nmoderate discussion groups online, receive and mark essays sent in by email.\nSet up'real' office hours for those students who live nearby.\nStudents want some 'synchronous' online events; so must get technician to find\nout about RealAudio and record some lectures for next year Also worried\nabout the new OU global course in this area; how can she differentiate her\ncourse? (What about her students at the BBC?) Can she write something\nabout this in a journal and count it for the next RAE?\nTable 5: Application of the three-phase model to an online course.\nProduction and delivery\nMaintenance and evaluation\n100\nALT-J Volume 8 Number I\nDiscussion\nAll the problems are not solved with the three-phase model. An attempt has been made to\nensure that all aspects of a course depending overtly and substantially on student numbers\nare mapped into the production and delivery phase. This includes assessment. We note the\nargument that assessment is not part of the 'teaching' of a course (and indeed in some work-\nplanning models used in institutions, time for assessment is not explicitly counted). However\nthere is a counter-argument that assessment (or at least formative assessment) is part of the\nteaching (or at least of learning in new paradigms), and that is the view adopted in this paper.\nThe lifecycle model was developed to assist institutions that do not have their own model\nbut would like to use a model within the context of our proposed planning document and\nfinancial schema. In the wider context, the difficulties in developing a 'standard' model\nillustrate the lack of consensus in the sector about the best way to pursue course\ndevelopment. Adequate costing throughout the course lifecycle, and realistic attribution of\noverhead costs, are needed in universities today to inform resource-planning decisions and\naid the effective management of organizational change.\nThe second phase of the Costs of Networked Learning Project will involve developing the\ncurrent framework into a practical handbook featuring real or 'realistic' cost examples. A\nnumber of contentious issues raised by the study but outside the scope of this paper - such\nas the division of academic time and the recording of time - will be further investigated\nthrough workshops and discussions. It is hoped in time to widen the scope of the study\narea within education to include effectiveness, business models and the real cost of\ninformation technology in general (not just for teaching and learning). In this way, it is\nhoped that the cost-effectiveness of both traditional learning paradigms as well as new\nlearning technologies within the educational sector will be better understood. This will\nallow comparisons to be made between old and new approaches towards teaching and\nlearning, and will therefore enable the higher and further educational sectors to make more\ninformed decisions.\nAcknowledgements\nThe views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and the study team, who wish to\nacknowledge the support of the JISC and Sheffield Hallam University.\nReferences\nCrabb, G.
