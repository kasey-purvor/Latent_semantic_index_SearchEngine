Nowadays high angle implants have become more and\nmore important for deep submicron devices.3 Wafers are rou-\ntinely implanted with doses that exceed the equilibrium solid\nsolubility of the implanted atom in silicon. The electrical\nactivation is correlated to the fraction of the dopant that is\nlocated in substitutional sites in the silicon lattice. A tech-\nnique which is capable of quantifying the substitutional frac-\ntion of a dopant in ion implanted silicon is Rutherford back-\nscattering spectroscopy ~RBS! and ion channeling.4\nWe have carried out a detailed study of the effect of the\nangle of incidence on the atomic and electrical profiles of the\nimportant dopants, namely: arsenic, boron, and antimony im-\nplanted into both amorphous and crystalline silicon. While\narsenic and boron ions are the most common n and p type\ndopants, phosphorous and antimony are also used as n-type\ndopants. In particular, antimony may replace arsenic for the\nfabrication of ultrashallow n-type layers for future genera-\ntions of complementary metal oxide semiconductor devices\nref Erik Collarts IIT paper.4~a! In this article the effects of\nchanging the tilt angle on the substitutional fraction and the\nelectrical activation of the dopant antimony will be pre-\nsented.\nEXPERIMENT\nThe first batch of 200 mm Si wafers were implanted with\n70 keV 531014 Sb1 cm22, at RT with tilt angles of 0\u00b0, 15\u00b0,\n30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 60\u00b0 ~all at 0\u00b0 twist!. The second batch was\npreamorphized using 160 keV Ge1 with a dose of\n131015 cm22 prior to the antimony implants which were\nperformed on the SWIFT implanter5~a! manufactured by Ap-\nplied Materials\u00ae. Following implantation the samples were\nthermally annealed at 700 \u00b0C for 30 s in order to activate the\ndopant. The annealing was performed in a Process Product\nCorporation rapid thermal processor system in a nitrogen\nambient. A temperature of 700 \u00b0C was chosen because the\nhighest activation of antimony has been observed in the tem-\nperature range 600\u2013800 \u00b0C ~Ref. 5~b!! with no measurable\ndiffusion, in contrast to the case for arsenic implants which\nneed higher temperatures, normally in excess of 1000 \u00b0C.

The dynamic secondary ion mass spectros-\ncopy ~SIMS! profiles have been carried out by using the\nmagnetic sector CAMECA SC-ultra apparatus. This instru-\nment is equipped with a floating voltage primary column\ncoupled with a secondary extraction system to obtain lower\nimpact energy of primary ion and maintain a good\nsensitivity.6\nThe analyses have been performed by using a cesium\nprimary beam and monitoring the secondary negative ions\n28Si22 and 28Si121Sb2. The impact energy selected for the\nanalyses was 1 keV with an incidence angle of nearly 45\u00b0.\nUnder these conditions the decay length has been measured\nto be 1.8 nm.7 The retained dose and the substitutional frac-\ntion were determined by Rutherford backscattering and ion\nchanneling using a 1.5 MeV 4He1 ion beam with two detec-\ntors at scattering angles of 166\u00b0 and 147\u00b0. The sheet carrier\nconcentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad HL5500 Hall\neffect system using the van der Pauw technique.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nSIMS profiles have been performed to determine the\ndepth distribution and the retained dose in the as-implanted\nand annealed samples. In all figures some points have been\nskipped ~every five points! in order to distinguish the differ-\nent profiles. Figures 1 and 2 show the depth distribution for\nimplants into preamorphized and crystalline silicon with tilt\nangle from 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. Figures 3 and 4 show the depth profiles\nfor the same samples after annealing at 700 \u00b0C for 30 s. The\nSWIFT implanter is capable of implanting the same dose\nregardless of the tilt angle. The wafer can be tilted at arbi-\ntrary angles ~up to 60\u00b0!, but the scan is isocentric, that is, the\nwafer is moved in its plane. Because of this, no cosine terms\nneed to be considered ~as the area exposed remains the same,\nhence, the dose is also the same!. The projected range Rp and\nthe straggle sp are a function of the tilt angle. If the wafer is\ntilted at a large angle to the ion beam the effective ion energy\nnormal to the surface is greatly reduced.8 The dose ~area\nunder the profile! is the same for all the implants; conse-\nquently the peak concentration increases because the straggle\nsp decreases with the cosine of the tilt angle ~see Table I!.\nThe peak concentration of antimony, for all samples, is\nhigher than the solid solubility of antimony in silicon,\n131020 cm23.9 As the tilt angle increases, the peak concen-\ntration increases and therefore the number of antimony at-\noms in excess of the solid solubility in silicon also increases.\nAnalysis of the RBS data was carried out using the\nDatafurnace software.10\nThe crystalline sample is also amorphized, by the anti-\nmony implant, albeit to a shallower depth than the samples\npreamorphized with germanium. During annealing epitaxial\nregrowth occurs and some of the antimony atoms move on to\nsubstitutional sites and become electrically active.\nFIG. 1.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nFor all samples the substitutional fraction as determined\nby RBS is slightly higher than the measured electrical acti-\nvation. However, because the errors associated with each of\nthe two techniques overlap, we conclude that the two mea-\nsurements are in agreement, within the experimental uncer-\ntainty. For the preamorphized samples the substitutional frac-\ntion decreases from 96% to 86% with increasing tilt angle.\nFor the crystalline samples the substitutional fraction in-\ncreases from 84% to 94%, from 0\u00b0 to 15\u00b0, and then decreases\nto 79% with increasing tilt angle ~to 60\u00b0!.\nThis trend is also observed in the electrical characteris-\ntics of these samples. All of the peak atomic concentrations\nrecorded in Table I are above the published equilibrium solid\nsolubility limit. Indeed if the percentage electrical activity is\ntaken into account the peak value still remains above this\nsolubility limit. That is, if the percentage electrical activity\n~Table II! is multiplied by the peak atomic concentration\n~Table I! a value of 1.6\u2013 1.731020 cm23 is obtained, with\nthe exception of the zero tilt implant into crystalline silicon\nwhich produces a value of 1.431020 cm23. This suggests\nthat the solubility of antimony in silicon under the conditions\nused for implantation and annealing ~700 \u00b0C! is\n1.6\u2013 1.731020 atoms cm23. The electrical activity and the\nsubstitutional fraction are lower than expected for the zero\ndegree implant into crystalline silicon ~Fig. 7!. We found a\nsimilar behavior for both arsenic and boron implants and\nbelieve that this phenomenon is associated with channeling\nof the implanted ions, which occurs readily for the zero angle\ntilt implant and produces a long tail to the atomic distribu-\ntion. The damage distribution is also modified and in turn,\ncauses a reduction in both the electrical activity and the sub-\nstitutional fraction. It is postulated that the excess antimony\natoms above our measured solubility are accommodated in\nthe form of clusters or precipitates which are electrically in-\nactive.\nCONCLUSION\nIt has been shown that the substitutional fraction is a\nfunction of the implant tilt angle and can be correlated with\nthe fraction of electrically activated antimony atoms. The\nmaximum activation of antimony ~9%! is observed at 0\u00b0 tilt\nfor implants into amorphous silicon. In crystalline silicon the\nmaximum activation ~90%! is observed at 15\u00b0 tilt. For all tilt\nangles the electrical activation in preamorphized silicon was\ngreater than for the same implant into crystalline silicon. Our\ndata suggest that the solubility limit of antimony in silicon at\n700 \u00b0C is about 1.6\u2013 1.731020 cm23.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the UK Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council ~EPSRC! for part of\nthe funding for this project and for student access to the Ion\nBeam Center at the University of Surrey.
