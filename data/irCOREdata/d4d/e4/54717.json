Introduction\n[2] Geoengineering has been proposed as a means to\nreduce surface greenhouse\u2010induced warming and help avert\ndiscontinuous state transitions in the Earth system (known\nloosely as \u2018tipping points\u2019 [Lenton et al., 2008]) and dan-\ngerous climate change [Hansen et al., 2006]. Solar Radiation\nManagement (SRM) geoengineering, through intervention\nwith various components of the incoming solar radiation\nbudget, restricts the amount of shortwave radiation absorbed\nby the Earth\u2019s surface [Lenton and Vaughan, 2009]. An\nadvantage of SRM is that it could produce a relatively rapid\ncooling compared to traditional mitigation or carbon captur-\ning geoengineering [Lenton and Vaughan, 2009; Robock\net al., 2009]. Hence, while it does not address geochemi-\ncal impacts of elevated atmospheric CO2 such as ocean\nacidification [Matthews et al., 2009; Robock et al., 2009],\nSRM has thus attracted attention particularly in the context\nof an \u2018emergency\u2019 mitigation option.\n[3] General Circulation Model (GCM) studies of large\nscale SRM geoengineering schemes, such as the creation of\na solar \u2018sunshade\u2019 [Angel, 2006] or stratospheric sulphate\naerosol injection [Crutzen, 2006] have revealed that a\nglobally uniform intervention cannot cancel out the pattern\nof warming that elevated CO2 creates [Brovkin et al., 2009;\nGovindasamy et al., 2003; Lunt et al., 2008]. Even for a\nperfect correction for the global mean surface air tempera-\nture, the poles are left relatively warmer and the Equator\ncooler due to differences in the zonal distributions of short\nand long wave radiation budget [Govindasamy et al., 2003;\nLunt et al., 2008]. Adverse impacts of SRM geoengineering\non the hydrological cycle may be more serious, with most\nsimulations indicating a global reduction in precipitation\nwith more acute changes regionally [Bala et al., 2008; Lunt\net al., 2008]. The potential to exacerbate droughts (or\nfloods) beyond the effects of elevated CO2 alone makes the\nconsideration of SRM geoengineering technologies contro-\nversial [Bala et al., 2008; Robock et al., 2009].\n[4] The nature and patterns of the climatic (and ultimately,\nsocio\u2010economic) impact of geoengineering must hence be\nunderstood for adequately informed decision making on\npotential SRM implementation. In this paper we explore\ndifferent ways in which regional disparities in geoengi-\nneering impacts can be assessed in a fully coupled climate\nmodel. However, it must be borne in mind that GCMs,\nwhilst being the best available tools (short of large\u2010scale\nfield trials and partial deployment) to assess the likely im-\npacts of SRM geoengineering, currently do not perform well\non the regional scale and particularly not for precipitation\n[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),\n2007].\n2. Methodology\n[5] We used the fully coupled atmosphere\u2010ocean UK Met\nOffice GCM, HadCM3L [Cox et al., 2000] in a configura-\ntion identical to that described by Lunt et al. [2008]. With\nthis, we carried out twelve 400\u2010year climate model simu-\nlations, all initialized from the end of a (pre\u2010industrial) spin\u2010\nup totaling more than 1000 years, with the final 100 years\nused to calculate the climatological averages. Of these, three\nfollowed Lunt et al. [2008] \u2013 a pre\u2010industrial control (\u2018Pre\u2019),\na simulation with atmospheric CO2 set at 1120 ppmv, i.e.,\n4 times the pre\u2010industrial value (\u20180%Geo\u2019), and a simulation\nwith 1120 ppmv but reduced solar constant (\u2018100%Geo\u2019). In\n100%Geo (full SRM), the reduction in the solar constant is\nchosen such that the global annual mean 2m air temperature\nis as close as possible to that of the Pre simulation and\ndetermined iteratively [Lunt et al., 2008]. For 100%Geo, the\nsolar constant is 57 Wm\u22122 less than that of Pre, a reduction\nof 4.2%. A further nine simulations were carried out; all at\n1120ppmv CO2 but differing in that the solar constant is\nreduced by a fraction of the maximum 100%Geo value from\n10% to 90% in increments of 10%. It should be recognized\nthat these simulations are not intended to represent realistic\nscenarios of future climate or geoengineering mitigation per\nse, but instead are designed to illustrate the effect of degrees\n1Bristol Research Initiative for the Dynamic Global Environment,\nSchool of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.\n2British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094\u20108276\/10\/2010GL044447\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 37, L18702, doi:10.1029\/2010GL044447, 2010\nL18702 1 of 6\nof SRM geoengineering on a high\u2010CO2 world and how the\nspatial patterns of impact might change.\n3. Results\n[6] As previously noted [e.g., Govindasamy et al., 2003;\nBrovkin et al., 2009; Lunt et al., 2008], we find that SRM\ndoes not perfectly cancel the warming due to elevated CO2\nlevels, even when prescribing a reduction in the solar con-\nstant sufficient to return the global average surface tem-\nperature to pre\u2010industrial (Figure 1a). With an increasing\ndegree of SRM geoengineering deployment, surface air\ntemperatures (SAT) decrease, with higher latitudes cooling\nmore than lower latitudes. For full SRM deployment (100%\nGeo), annual SAT at the Equatorial regions becomes cooler\nthan pre\u2010industrial (\u223c \u22120.5\u00b0C) while the poles remain\nwarmer (\u223c +1\u00b0C). This temperature difference between the\nPolar Regions and the Equatorial regions arises due to the\nspatial difference between the radiative forcing effect of the\nreduced insolation and the raised CO2 levels and is ampli-\nfied by the operation of temperature feedbacks involving\nsnow cover and sea\u2010ice extent.\nFigure 1. Zonally averaged anomaly with pre\u2010industrial control. (a) Mean annual surface air temperature (SAT) and\n(b) precipitation. Plots show the sine of latitude (to facilitate comparison on a per\u2010area impacted basis) against the level of\nSRM geoengineering.\nIRVINE ET AL.: REGIONAL DISPARITIES IN GEOENGINEERING L18702L18702\n2 of 6\n[7] The response of the zonal average precipitation\nanomaly as a function of the level of SRM is more complex\n(Figure 1b). In the simulated unmitigated 4 \u00d7 CO2 climate\n(0%Geo), we find substantial changes in hydrology which\nare broadly consistent with other fully coupled climate\nmodels [IPCC, 2007] \u2013 increases in precipitation in the\ntropics and high latitudes and decreases in the sub\u2010tropics.\nFor the three wetter bands (Tropical, extra\u2010tropical, and\nPolar), increasing the level of SRM decreases precipitation,\nand in the 100%Geo experiment, the extra\u2010tropical regions\nend up drier and the tropics wetter than in the pre\u2010industrial.\nIn the southern subtropical zone between 10S and 15S, we\nobserve a maximum in precipitation at \u223c50% deployment\nand reduced precipitation at 0%Geo and 100%Geo.\n[8] However, aggregating geoengineering climatic chan-\nges into zonal and annual averages hides a more complex\nand heterogeneous pattern of geoengineering impacts. To\nvisualize this we have defined a series of averaging regions,\nconsisting of grouped national boundaries (but which are\nfurther subdivided to avoid averaging over disparate climate\nconditions) and based on those from the FUND model\n(Figure 2f). For illustration, here we show the change in\nannual and seasonal (Northern Hemisphere seasons, e.g.\nJune, July and August for summer, etc.) precipitation for\nfive different regions (Figure 2).\n[9] We find that the United States mainland region shows\nthe closest match to global average values in precipitation;\nstarting from a positive anomaly in annual precipitation of\n+7.7% at 0%Geo and decreasing with progressive applica-\ntion of SRM to \u221211.8% at 100%Geo. Annual precipitation\nreaches pre\u2010industrial values between 40% and 50% of full\nSRM deployment (Figure 2a), although the seasonality of\nrainfall has changed with relatively more rainfall in Autumn\nand Winter than Spring and Summer at 40\u201350%. The East\nFigure 2. (a\u2013e) The average daily rainfall in mm per day, both seasonally and annually, as a function of the level of geoen-\ngineering.

The Brazilian and\nAustralian regions (Figures 2c and 2d) display large\nreductions in annual precipitation at 0%Geo which is ame-\nliorated, to a greater or lesser extent, by increasing levels of\nSRM. The Australian region shows a complete recovery\nfrom a 28.0% reduction in annual precipitation at 0%Geo\nand returns to the pre\u2010industrial average at 100%Geo. The\nBrazilian region shows a lesser recovery from \u221234.8% to\n\u22129.5%. In the Western European region (Figure 2e) there is\na shift to a much drier summer and a wetter winter at 0%Geo\nand under increased levels of SRM this shifts and the pre\u2010\nindustrial seasonality is restored however, overall the\nWestern European region shows relatively little response in\nannual average precipitation to SRM deployment. It should\nbe noted that despite using 100 year averages to calculate\nthe climate state there will still be a degree of natural vari-\nability in these results.\n[10] Even at the aggregation level of the regions discussed\nabove, important smaller scale impacts may still be\nFigure 3.

Moreover, geoengineering impacts will differ\nsubstantially in socio\u2010economic terms according to the\nrelationship between climatic change and for example, dis-\ntributions of population and cropland. We have thus\nexplored an alternative means of assessing the regionality\nof the climate response to geoengineering, retaining the\nimpacts calculated at the native resolution of the climate\nmodel (3.75\u00b0 longitude by 2.5\u00b0 latitude [Cox et al., 2000]),\nbut calculating a single index by weighting the impacts\naccording to specific \u2019recipients\u2019. To illustrate, we present\nanalysis weighted on a cropland fractional area and popu-\nlation density (per capita) basis, i.e. the impact on a small,\nhighly cultivated region would be equal to the same impact\non a large expanse of lightly cultivated land if they\ncontained the same total area of crops, whilst two regions\nwith the same intensity of cultivation would be weighted in\ndirect proportion to their area. Figures 3e and 3f show the\nfraction of global crop area and population, at the resolution\nof the GCM model, used to generate this weighting.\n[11] Figure 3a summarizes the changes in global average\ntemperature and precipitation as well as average changes\nover crop area and populated areas. The crop area is cal-\nculated from the distribution of C3 and C4 grasses in\nmanaged regions derived from the Wilson and Henderson\u2010\nSellers vegetation cover dataset [Wilson and Henderson\u2010\nSellers, 1985] and the population distribution is derived\nfrom the LandScan 2007 population dataset [LandScan\u2122,\n2007]. At 0%Geo, compared to pre\u2010industrial, globally\nthere is a 4.87\u00b0C warming and a 5.8% increase in precipi-\ntation whereas at 100%Geo there is a return to the pre\u2010\nindustrial temperature and a 5% reduction in the average\nprecipitation [Lunt et al., 2008]. To return average annual\nprecipitation to the pre\u2010industrial value globally would\nrequire \u223c55% of full geoengineering deployment. However,\nthis figure is \u223c75% for crop regions and \u223c85% for populated\nareas.\n[12] Even weighting by crop area\/population density will\nmask disparities in regional precipitation and hence \u2018winners\u2019\nand \u2018losers\u2019 of SRM geoengineering. We therefore introduce\nthe concept of a \u2018novel\u2019 climate, which we define as the\nexistence of a climatic state, measured by either surface\ntemperature or rainfall (annual or seasonal), that lies outside\nthe continuum of climatic states bounded by the pre\u2010\nindustrial and an unmitigated (\u00d74 CO2) greenhouse. For\nexample, for a full SRM deployment, we would class the\ncooler\u2010than\u2010pre\u2010Industrial tropics [Brovkin et al., 2009;\nGovindasamy et al., 2003] as constituting a \u2018novel\u2019 climate.\nHowever, to give a reasonable margin of error and to\naccount for inter\u2010annual variability we require the mean\ngeoengineered climate state to exceed a threshold, based\non the standard deviation of pre\u2010industrial or unmitigated\n(\u00d74 CO2) climate variability, before it is classed as \u2018novel\u2019.\nFigures 3b, 3c, and 3d show the fraction of the global area\n(Figure 3b), crop area (Figure 3c) and population (Figure 3d)\nwhich are affected by a novel climate at each level of SRM\nfor 3 different thresholds, i.e. a climate state that is beyond\n0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 standard deviations of the upper\/lower\nbound. For global aggregation (Figure 3b), we find, using\nthe lowest threshold (+\/\u22120.25 SD), that for all levels of\ngeoengineering some regions are affected by a novel pre-\ncipitation, with 67% of the world affected at 100%Geo.\nWith a more stringent threshold for a novel precipitation,\nthe fractions affected are much lower, 33% for the mod-\nerate threshold (+\/\u22120.5 SD) 5% for the highest threshold\n(+\/\u22121.0 SD). For crop area aggregation (Figure 3c) there is\nlittle change from the global picture but for population\naggregation (Figure 3d) there is an increase in the affected\nfraction at higher levels of geoengineering for all threshold\nlevels. Novel (cool) temperature conditions occur in the\nglobal analysis at around 70\u201380%Geo with 61% of the\nearth affected at the lowest threshold, dropping somewhat\nto 35% affected at the highest threshold. For both crop area\n(Figure 3c) and population (Figure 3d) aggregation a smaller\nfraction is affected by the cooler temperatures, this is due to\nthe cooling mainly occurring in tropical and ocean areas.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\n[13] GCMs have model\u2010specific biases, particularly with\nrespect to precipitation changes at the regional and seasonal\nscales, and this will be reflected in assessments of geo-\nengineering impacts. Even at the global scale, it is noticeable\nthat models differ in the percentage (or absolute W m\u22122)\nreduction in the solar constant needed to cancel out a given\nelevation of CO2 (e.g., \u00d74). For instance, Govindasamy\net al. [2003] find that to offset the warming of a quadru-\npling of CO2 compared to pre\u2010industrial, a 3.6% reduction in\ninsolation is required, compared to our estimate of 4.2%.\nThis difference likely reflects inter\u2010model differences in\nclimate sensitivity, because many of the same climate feed-\nbacks will operate in response to both changes in incoming\nshortwave radiations and CO2. The warming of 4.02\u00b0C\nreported by Govindasamy et al. [2003] at 4 \u00d7 CO2 compared\nto 4.87\u00b0C in this study is in approximately the same pro-\nportion as the solar constant change, supporting our inter-\npretation. Precipitation patterns are not as well modeled in\nGCMs as temperature patterns and so our results should be\nviewed with this in mind [IPCC, 2007]. The GCM ensemble\nused in the IPCC\u2019s 4th report reproduced the observed zonal\nmean distribution of precipitation well and captured the\nmajor regional precipitation patterns (e.g. maxima over\nrainforests), but there were deficiencies in the ensemble\u2019s\nestimates for tropical precipitation, particularly in the trop-\nical Atlantic and around the Bay of Bengal and the Maritime\ncontinent [IPCC, 2007]. When predicting precipitation\nchanges as a result of global warming by the end of the 21st\ncentury, the magnitude of the change varies between GCMs\nwith agreement on the sign of the change in most regions,\nwith most of the disagreement in the mid\u2010latitudes [IPCC,\n2007].\n[14] Furthermore, although the coupled GCM we used,\nHadCM3L, has been used in studies of future and past cli-\nmates [e.g., Cox et al., 2000; Lunt et al., 2007], it has a\nrelatively low resolution compared to many models used in\nthe 4th Assessment Report [IPCC, 2007]. We have also\nchosen to keep vegetation fixed at pre\u2010industrial values in the\nsimulations in this study, therefore neglecting vegetation\u2010\nclimate feedbacks.\n[15] If SRM geoengineering were to be implemented, it is\napparent that it need not be deployed fully (i.e., to return\nglobal average temperatures to the pre\u2010industrial value) and\nalternative mitigation objectives such as ensuring a neutral\nsurface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet\n[Oppenheimer and Alley, 2005] might be considered. For\ninstance, we have previously found [Irvine et al., 2009] that\nthe level of SRM geoengineering required to prevent any\nIRVINE ET AL.: REGIONAL DISPARITIES IN GEOENGINEERING L18702L18702\n5 of 6\nmelting of the Greenland ice sheet in the Glimmer ice\u2010sheet\nmodel [Rutt et al., 2009] was 60%Geo or above, with a\npartial ice sheet maintained with interventions of 30%Geo to\n50%Geo. Note however that the model used here, does not\naccount for fast\u2010flow ice dynamics [Rutt et al., 2009], which\nplayed a dominant role in the variation in Greenland ice\u2010\nsheet mass balance over the 20th century [Rignot et al.,\n2008]. Restricting to only partial deployment may also\navoid the occurrence of a significant area being affected by\nnovel climates and hence adverse impacts.\n[16] Although the results presented here are illustrative\nrather than predictive per se, and need to be replicated\nwith higher resolution GCMs and ideally in multi\u2010model\nensembles, they indicate that it might be possible to identify\na level of SRM geoengineering sufficient to maintain the\nGreenland ice sheet and cool the climate significantly via\nSRM, but without a large reduction in global precipitation\nand exposing only a small fraction of the Earth to novel\nclimates. Clearly, a comprehensive cost\u2010benefit analysis\ncovering the impacts on agriculture, biodiversity, human\nhealth and other factors would also be required to assess\nadequately any proposed SRM geoengineering intervention.\n[17] Acknowledgments.
