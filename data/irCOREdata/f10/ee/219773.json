The aim of this paper, however, is to analyze Du Pont\u2019s failure in \nperforming the political and economic doctrine he was an active promoter of all along his life: \nphysiocracy. In all of his very diverse activities, be they scientific, political, or \nentrepreneurial, Du Pont indeed deliberately attempted to enact this original liberal doctrine. \nHe tried, along with fellow physiocrats, to introduce freedom of trade and enterprise in Old \nRegime French minds and economic practices. Later, when emigrating to the United States, \nhe devised a plan for a physiocratic colony. But none of these ventures was actually a success \nduring Du Pont\u2019s lifetime: the performation of some of physiocracy\u2019s main propositions only \ncame later, in a diffuse and partial way. We contend that this relative failure of performativity \ncan be explained by Du Pont\u2019s specific type of agency: one relying mainly on political \nengineering, based on personal ties and reputations, as well as on a strict distinction between \nends and means. \n 2 \nAnalyses of the performativity of economics tend to suggest a \u201cconvergence\u201d of economies \ntowards a single model, that of the so-called \u201cmarket economy\u201d, which is said to consist in a \nworld of free bilateral exchanges between interested and calculative agencies (Callon, 2007) \nIn this idea lies the more or less explicit \u201ccritical\u201d dimension of these analyses, which often \nintend to fight, by exhibiting it, the supposedly overwhelming power of \u201cliberal\u201d economic \ntheories and theorists. But this argument is weakened by the heterogeneity that one can \nperceive in the field of contemporary economics, with economists often disagreeing over \nwhat theories should prevail, and various theories emerging, and being performed, that \ncontradict the \u201cstandard\u201d, \u201corthodox\u201d model. Because of the proliferation of economic \nliterature, the notion of what is \u201cliberal\u201d and what is not has become hard to clarify. In order \nto circumvent this difficulty, our suggestion here is to look back at the modern origins of \nliberal economic thought, when liberalism was first explicitly identified. These origins can be \nfound in great part, before Adam Smith, in the physiocratic school of thoughti. The \nphysiocrats were indeed, in eighteenth century France, the first systematic advocates of \n\u201claisser-faire, laisser-passer\u201d, a creed that they derived from what they were also among the \nfirst to call the \u201cnew science\u201d of \u201cpolitical economy\u201d (Steiner, 1998a). \nThe critical perspective thus becomes far more specific. Rather than trying to disentangle \nanalytically a maze of theorists, practitioners and artefacts that would promote and help enact \na more or less clearly defined model of the economy, we face a rather small group of people \nwho willingly initiated the historical efforts in favour of the liberty of activity and trade. And \nthey did so not only as \u201ctheorists\u201d, although the word was starting to emerge in the French \nlanguageii, but also as powerful members of the royal administration, Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, the \nfather of physiocracy, being a close counselor to king Louis XV. Those who where first called \n\u201cthe Economists\u201d were thus in charge of actual policies, and performing their theories was \ntheir intentional goal. Undoubtedly, the most active of them was Pierre Samuel Du Pont de \nNemours (1739-1817). The man was a restless promoter of physiocracy: he was a \nhardworking editor of physiocratic literature, and this is how he came to be the one who \ncoined the word \u201cphysiocracy\u201d; but he was also a restless civil servant, who worked for \nsuccessive Contr\u00f4leurs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux des finances (ministries of finance) during his extremely \nlong life; and he participated in numerous business ventures, both in France and the United \nStates of America, where he first arrived on January 3rd, 1800. This paper proposes to tell the \nstory of Du Pont\u2019s life, with a focus on his continuously repeated attempts to make \nphysiocracy thrive in practice. \nIn doing so, we will try to assess the actual power \u2013 and limits \u2013 of deliberate political action \nwhen it comes to performing theories. With Du Pont, we are not only confronted with an \n\u201ceconomist in the wild\u201d (Callon, 2007), but also with one that explicitly intended to perform \nthe political and economic doctrine he supported, and this \u2013 as we will see \u2013 mainly through \nwhat may be described retrospectively as \u201cpolitical\u201d means. The performative agency thus \ntook a specific shape in the case studied here, where the \u201csovereign subject\u201d of action was \nover-inflated: the pro-physiocratic agency we observe was dominated by a central character \u2013\n or at least a few ones. What were the consequences of this? Rather paradoxically given how \nliberalism later flourished, Du Pont\u2019s activities seem to have led to repeated \u201cperformative \nfailures\u201d (Butler, this issue), at least if \u2013 at first \u2013 we look at them on a limited timescale. In \ntheir lifetime, most of the efforts of the physiocrats to perform their doctrine actually failed, in \nspite of their tenacity and of the crucial support they sometimes got from a subject as \n\u201csovereign\u201d as one can get: the king. Liberalism wasn\u2019t born in one day nor through the \nmeans they expected. The aim of this paper is therefore to account for the rather surprising \ninefficiency of the political engineering used by Du Pont and his fellow physiocrats in their \nperformative attempts. \n 3 \nPROLOGUE \nBiographical works on Du Pont have been plethoric, but most of them went in either one of \ntwo different directions that we intend to combine. Biographies of the \u201chonest man\u201d, of the \n\u201csoldier of liberty\u201d have depicted Du Pont\u2019s vivid personality, sometimes brilliantly, as well \nas his family and statesman\u2019s lives, in a way he had inaugurated himself when writing the \nautobiography of his training years (Du Pont de Nemours, 1906). They have also emphasized \ntended to make him the indirect founder (through is second son Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e) of the gigantic DuPont \nde Nemours & Company chemistry firm, which has been a longstanding symbol of most \nshifts in economic history over the past two centuries, as a managerially and technologically \ninnovative firm (Chandler & Salsbury, 1971; Lamoreaux & Sokoloff, 2002; Yates, 1989), but \nalso as one relating closely with the Federal state, or developing mass markets \n(Ndiaye, 2007). Thorough studies of Du Pont\u2019s economic writings were also conducted, by \nhistorians of economic thought, who were sometimes interested in the man\u2019s relationships \nwith other economic and political theorists (Weulersse, 1910). But, strangely enough, even \nthe \u201ceconomic biography\u201d of Du Pont\u2019s life as a businessman that is presented in the ultimate \nbook on Du Pont\u2019s economic theories hardly connects these two aspects of the character\u2019s \ntrajectory (McLain, 1977). Writings and actions are seldom mixed, and this may explain some \ninterpretation problems, with Du Pont\u2019s various biographies contradicting one another on \ncertain points. \nBut Du Pont, although he had multiple lives, remained all along a particularly coherent \ncharacter. As an intellectual, he was so coherent that he was even criticized as a man of \n\u201csystem\u201d. He also made his acts as adequate as he could to his thoughts, be it as a civil \nservant or as an entrepreneur. \u201cIn short, as Gustave Schelle puts it in the hagiographic tone \nshared by most biographers of the \u2018great man\u2019, all the acts and all the writings of this thinker \nwere inspired by a constant sentiment, which is nowhere expressed more sincerely: the love \nof humanity and justice\u201d (Schelle, 1888:3). If one must depart from the hagiography, it is \nnevertheless difficult not to agree with such an insistence on Du Pont\u2019s integrity. The reading \nof his rich epistolary production reveals how much he made efforts to make his actions fit \nwith his thoughts, and conversely, not only by following whatever vague \u201cconstant \nsentiment\u201d, but also by using in practice the intellectual tools he had conceived as a published \nwriter, or by transforming present events into opportunities for renewed reflection on his \ntheories. Letters, as a communication genre, do favour this kind of fit between thought and \naction, but it needs to be stressed that Du Pont\u2019s published writings themselves also interacted \nclosely with his personal experiences. It was the case, obviously, of his Philosophie de \nl\u2019univers, which was written as a reaction to the Terror and which prescribed rules for \nindividual behaviour that Du Pont then tried to obey (Du Pont de Nemours, 1795). It was also \nthe case of his economic writings, that were always in direct touch with what he did and \nobserved as a man of action. \nThe types of rationality that structure what may be considered as Du Pont\u2019s \u201ctheoretic\u201d \nwritings have been analyzed elsewhere, Philippe Steiner having shown with much clarity how \nDu Pont contributed to the emergence of \u201cformally rational\u201d economic knowledge without \nrenouncing a certain \u201cmaterial rationality\u201d, that of theories designed for action, especially in \nthe political sphere (Steiner, 1998b). But Du Pont\u2019s \u201caction writings\u201d \u2013 the legal texts he \nproduced, as well as his letters, prospectuses, and working documents, especially those in \nwhich he formulated his business projects \u2013 have not been given much attention. These \ndocuments take us one step closer to action, as close as one can be to the relation between \nacting and writingiii. We will analyze these texts in their chronological sequence, in order to \naccount for the successive performative efforts made by Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours \n 4 \nall along his life. From the reign of Louis XV to the Restauration, Du Pont indeed changed \npriorities, starting as a member of the royal administration in the 1760\u2019s, but then sailing \naway from the Directoire to the United States, out of discouragement, in the last months of \n1799, with the project to realise physiocracy through business, rather then policy. Failing to \ndo so, he came back to France and civil service as early as 1802, and then only went back to \nthe US for his very last years, in 1815. \nDU PONT\u2019S SCIENTIFIC PEDAGOGY \nIn the early 1760\u2019s, Du Pont was looking for a position, after having renounced being a \nwatchmaker \u2013 as his father was and wanted him to be \u2013 or a doctor \u2013 a profession he had \ntrained for but never actually practiced. He had read Vauban and just written a treatise on \ntaxes, thanks to which he managed to get introduced to Quesnay, the father of physiocracy, \nand became his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, before being that of Turgot. This was the beginning, for young \nDu Pont, of a long carrier at the service of the royal administration, mainly in the Bureau of \ncommerce as General inspector of commerce and manufactures. But it was especially the time \nof his entry into Quesnay\u2019s \u201cwriting workshop,\u201d (Th\u00e9r\u00e9 & Charles, 2008) which made him \npart of a group that its opponents called the \u201cSect of Economists\u201d because of its intellectual \ncoherence, of its obedience to its master, and of how keen its members were to see their \ndoctrine enacted. \nPhysiocracy indeed proposed an original conception of the social function of science. It \npresented human societies as being naturally ordered, ruled by essential laws that would \nguarantee the happiness of each and everyone. This was made especially clear in Du Pont\u2019s \nsynthetic presentation of the physiocratic doctrine, On the origins and progress of a new \nscience: \u201cThere is a natural Society, that is anterior to any convention between men, based on \ntheir constitution, on their physical needs, on their evidently common interest\u201d (Du Pont \nde Nemours, 1768). According to these anti-hobbesian principles, the absence of happiness in \nsociety was exclusively due to the adoption of bad conventions by men. The complete \nsatisfaction of needs and interests was indeed possible only if these conventions met certain \nconditions. The \u201cstate of nature\u201d that was described by Du Pont and his fellow physiocrats \nindeed differed from the one conceived by Rousseau, whose \u201cnoble savage\u201d was promptly \nsatisfied. Man does aspire to \u201cenjoyment\u201d, i.e. both that of the goods that are necessary to his \nsurvival, and that of his fellowmen\u2019s company, which includes sexual enjoyment, with its \nconsequences in terms of population growthiv. But \u201cthe spontaneous productions of the earth \nand waters are not sufficient to make a numerous population subsist, nor to provide men with \nthe goods they deserve\u201d (Ibid.). Hence the necessity for men to be able to \u201cmultiply \nproductions, culture, in order to improve their condition\u201d (Ibid.). This is where what we \nwould today call the \u201ceconomic\u201d part of Du Pont\u2019s discourse started. He demonstrated that \nthe necessary growth of the \u201cnet product\u201d of agriculture was made possible by nature, but \nrequired that men obey nature\u2019s \u201cessential Laws\u201d, which consisted in the defence of property \nand liberty, thanks to which men were encouraged to undertake any productive activity and \nwere stimulated in doing so by open competition. As we can see, the science of natural order \ndid not prescribe another world \u2013 be it a primitive world, or an under-world \u2013 that men had to \ncreate entirely from scratch, in opposition to the current world. Physiocracy was only meant \nto make visible a back-world that was already here. This was one of the meanings of the \n\u201c\u00e9vidence\u201d that knowledge was meant to have according to Quesnay, followed in this by his \ndisciples, Du Pont being the most fervent of them. \nThis conception had strong consequences on the relations between science and action. \nScientific writing itself became political action. It had to shed light on the practices that had to \n 5 \nbe supported for the natural order of production and commerce to actually come into being. \nAnd it had to do so in a specific way, so that it could be understood by the right audience. \nDu Pont was aware of this very early in his author\u2019s life, as it appears in the foreword of his \nfirst published memoir, On the exportation and importation of grain (1764): \u201cSince truth \nexists by itself, and since it is in nature, to demonstrate doesn\u2019t mean anything else than to \nshow; and the art of judging is nothing else than the talent to open one\u2019s eyes\u201d. Du Pont \nreached this goal in two ways. First, he developed a concise argumentation, made of a \nsuccession of explicitly differentiated and articulated paragraphs that each provided a new \nargument. Second, he supplied figures to support his ideas. This was an essential element of \nthe intellectual style of physiocratic thought, and one of its main innovations, as it has often \nbeen emphasized about Quesnay\u2019s Tableau \u00e9conomique, first published in 1758 \n(Quesnay, 1760). Du Pont took over the same method, and designed his own \u201cTableau\u201d to \naccount for \u201cthe effect of the liberty of international commerce of grains, relative to the \ngrowth of Agriculture and Revenue\u201d over ten years (Cf. Figure 1). Without scrutinizing the \ndetails of the cash flows depicted in this table, one may notice at first glance that Du Pont \nmade a considerable effort to make these cash flows more easily readable than they were in \nQuesnay\u2019s \u201czigzag\u201d. The cash transfers from one year to the other only appeared in a single \nand carefully designed column, that of the \u201cnet product caused by the increase in productive \nadvances, depending on the proportion of agriculture in the given year\u201d. Annual lines were \ntherefore easily distinguished, and the distribution of the net product in between the different \nclasses of economic actors was made clear by the separate columns. The demonstrative power \nof such a presentation was meant to convince its readers, by making their future readable. But \nwho were these readers? \n \n \nImage 1 : \u00ab Tableau \u00bb in Pierre-Samuel Du Pont, De l\u2019exportation et de l\u2019importation des \ngrains, 1764, p. 46. \n 6 \n \nThe \u201cTableau\u201d provides first elements of answer to this question. The data it exposed, like \nthose of Quensay\u2019s \u201czigzag\u201d, were not macro-economic data, but those of an exemplary farm. \nThe physiocrats addressed first and foremost farmers and landowners, the main \nrecommendation being that the latter should reduce their conspicuous consumption and invest \nthe spared cash in their farms, in order to increase the productivity of these, for their own \nbenefit and that of society as a whole. In order to make this point convincingly, the data were \nalso empirically founded. On the one hand, Du Pont and his fellow physiocrats made good \nuse of the figures provided by journals that prescribed methods of \u201cwise m\u00e9nagement\u201d, like \nthe Journal \u0153conomique, which was born in 1751. On the other hand, the physiocrats all \nparticipated in gathering data from actual farms, thanks to a systematic collection of \naccounting information in the French countryside, with the notable help of the \u201cAgricultural \nSocieties\u201d that flourished all over the national territory during the period. It was particularly \nthe case in Soissons, where the Society \u201cgather(ed) agricultural memoirs dealing with the \ncounty, debating of big culture, and publishing by the end of the Old Regime its own \nquestionnaire (for farmers)\u201d (Perrot, 1978:563). It happened to be precisely in Soissons that \nDu Pont made his d\u00e9buts at the service of the royal administration, as an assistant to the local \nIntendant from 1763 to 1765, a period when he came to meet with Turgot \u2013 himself the \nIntendant of Limoges \u2013 and got more familiar than his urban education had enabled him to be \nwith the operations of French farms. This action of physiocrats towards farms was twofold. \nOf course, it aimed at improving the empirical adequacy of their theory. But it also \nparticipated in the circulation of accounting models in the French countryside. Combined with \nDu Pont\u2019s intense editorial activity in journals such as the Journal de l\u2019Agriculture (from \n1765 to 1766) and the \u00c9ph\u00e9m\u00e9rides du citoyen (from 1768 to 1772), this peaceful commerce \nof information was meant to contribute to the hold of physiocratic thought over the \u201csocial \nbase\u201d it intended to build upon. \nThanks to their texts and tables, the physiocrats did succeed in disseminating their ideas in \ncertain categories of society and in becoming thus more than a centralised agency. But the \nactual influence of their well-known doctrine seems to have been quite limited at first. \nFarmers and other entrepreneurs may have been convinced by the doctrine and the accounting \ninstruments that went with it. But the most powerful category, that of landowners, proved to \nbe difficult to convince through scientific pedagogy and administrative activism. The subtlety \nof Du Pont\u2019s arithmetic argumentation, although it was partly compensated by the greater \n\u201csimplicity\u201d of some of his fellow physiocrats, made it difficult for his ideas to reach the \nnobility, that did not manage its estates itself. On top of that, noblemen were not at all \nsupportive of the growing legitimacy given in the nascent bourgeois society to agricultural \nentrepreneurs, whose contribution to big culture versus small culture was widely acclaimed \nby the physiocrats (Franklin, 1978). The hope of Quesnay and his followers to see landowners \nact spontaneously according to their \u201cwell understood interests\u201d therefore got dimmer and \ndimmer during the reign of Louis XV, who died in 1774. The deliberate performation of the \nphysiocratic doctrine through scientific pedagogy was a failure in the short run. \nDU PONT\u2019S ECONOMIC POLICIES \nLuckily enough, or so it seemed, the physiocrats had devised another and possibly more \neffective mode of action, that Quesnay called \u201ceconomic governement\u201d, to perform their \ntheories: the idea was to pass \u201cpositive Laws\u201d by the mere \u201cdeclaration\u201d of the \u201cessential \nLaws of social order\u201d (Du Pont de Nemours, 1768:\u00a78) described in the physiocratic doctrine. \nIf landowners couldn\u2019t be convinced to become reasonable, then it was possible and necessary \n 7 \nto impose some constraints on them so that they be compelled to act more wisely, in their own \ninterest and in that of the kingdom. The dispersed agency of scientific pedagogy could be \nreplaced by a pure exercise of power from the central political authority. The problem, \nhowever, was to enforce these laws and not just declare them: the illocutionary force of the \nsovereign\u2019s speech acts and legal texts was far from being unlimited. \nWhile Quesnay was alive, in 1763 and 1764, the promulgation of the Edict of July 19th, 1764 \nofficially \u201cmade\u201d grain and flour trade entirely free in all the kingdom except for Paris and its \nsurroundings. \u201cThe preambule of the Edict, partly written by Du Pont, who was then working \nwith Turgot, was a real physiocratic profession of faith\u201d (Charbit, 2002:870), the Edict being \ndesigned so as \u201cto animate and extend the culture of land, whose product is the surest source \nof wealth for a State, to maintain abundance thanks to stores and the arrival of foreign grain, \nto stop grain from having a price that would discourage the cultivator, to avoid monopoly \nthrough the final exclusion of all particular permissions, and through the free and complete \ncompetition in commerce; finally maintain in between nations this communication of \nexchanges between unnecessary items and necessities, which complies so well with the order \nestablished by divine providence, and with the views of humanity that must guide sovereigns\u201d \n(Cornette, 1993:131-132). But the hopes of performation of their theory by Du Pont and his \nfellow physiocrats through such means also proved to be deceived. The following year, bad \nharvests and fears related to a possible increase in the price of bread \u2013 which was previously \nsubmitted to a strict regulation \u2013, made the enforcement of the Edict difficult. Local \nparliaments slowed the process down, and the \u201cjudges and police officers (\u2026) issued \nordinances that opposed the laws they were meant to enforce\u201d (Du Pont de Nemours, 1770, \ncited in Charbit, 2002:871). Declarative law wasn\u2019t sufficient for the performation of \nphysiocracy without a disciplined administration that would help make it real throughout the \ncountry through constraint. \nSimilar difficulties occurred from 1774 to 1776, after Louis XVI called Turgot back to office \nand issued the Edict of September 13th, 1774, which declared once again the entire liberty of \ncommerce. The decision indeed caused flour shortages: it \u201ccreated an atmosphere of intense \nspeculation, opened new markets for commerce, disorganized production, and raised fear and \nuncertainty\u201d, leading to what has been called the \u201cflour war\u201d (Kaplan, 1976:488). The \nsituation got even more complicated at this point, because of Turgot\u2019s simultaneous attacks \nagainst the privileges of the nobility, attacks which he considered were made necessary by the \nterrible situation public finances were in. Finally, the Anglo-French commercial treaty of \n1786, for which Du Pont acted both as an \u201ceconomic counsellor\u201d and a public advocate, under \nthe supervision of Contr\u00f4leur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vergennes, met with an unfavourable economic \nconjuncture as well as with the opposition of a nascent group of promoters of industrial \nproduction, led by the Chamber of commerce of Normandy, which was worried that English \ncompetition would compromise the industrial development of France (Murphy, 1966; \nD\u00e9mier, 1995). \nThe performation of the physiocratic doctrine as a general system of free trade meant to foster \nproduction and satisfaction in the French population therefore appears to have been a difficult \ntask, especially when attempted through such authoritative political means. Du Pont, who was \na restless worker, managed to remain a member of the administration until the last years of \nthe Old Regime, working notably with Calonne and Necker during the 1780\u2019s. In the 1790\u2019s, \nhowever, he progressively lost hope in the possible advent of the natural order he had been \ncalling for over the years. His last attempt at performing physiocracy through policy consisted \nin being a candidate for the Constituent Assembly, where he expected to be able to promote \nhis ideas better. Speaking directly to the representatives of the different classes of population, \nhe would have a chance to make them side with him for some important votes: power derived \n 8 \nfrom widespread influence, which had to be gained by speaking in the convincing way to the \nright people. He was indeed elected as a deputy for the bailliage of Nemours in March 1789 \nand became the President of the Assembly in 1790. The following year, he created a printing \nshop, both to make a living and to be able to print the texts he wanted to disseminate, \nincluding first of all physiocratic pamphlets by himself and other authors \u2013 notably Quesnay \nand Turgot, who had respectively died in 1774 and 1781. He even created a journal a few \nyears later (in 1794), called L\u2019Historien, where he could freely express his positions. \nHowever, the Terror, to which he survived only out of luckv, seems to have definitely turned \nhim away from what we would call today his \u201ceconomic\u201d preoccupations and the especially \nthe defence of freedom of trade and the promotion of investment in agriculture. According to \nJames McLain, \u201cfrom this period to the last decade of his life, political thought replaced \neconomic thought as his primary intellectual interest\u201d (McLain, 1977:46). The unstable \nsituation of the French regime would indeed have made the increase of farm production a \nsecondary goal for Du Pont, who mostly focused, from then on, on the promotion of what his \nmaster Quesnay had called \u201clegal despotism\u201d, which was the necessary institutional \nprecondition to the passing of physiocratic laws in favour of trade and agriculture in France. \nBut even that proved difficult in the troubled times the young French Republic was going \nthrough. As a member of the Council of ancients from 1795, Du Pont opposed the Directoire, \nwhich led to his being arrested and imprisoned in 1797 during the Fructidor 18th coup. The \nprinting shop he had created and which was his main source of revenue was ransacked during \nthe events. The situation was so bad that his freedom, wealth and life were threatened. \nUnder these circumstances, Du Pont\u2019s biographic trajectory shifted drastically in 1797: he \ndecided to leave France for the United States of America, with all his family. But the problem \nin France, as a matter of fact, was less for him the menace against his life and properties, than \nthe contradiction between his political ideals and the way things were evolving on the French \nscene. Political action as he conceived of it was no more possible for him, and he therefore \nhad no reason to stay (Thompson, 1969), as he explained it to one of his American \ncorrespondents in a letter from January 20th, 1800: \u201cWhen I took the painful resolution of \nmoving away from my homeland, it was because its Constitution was destroyed, because force \nreigned instead of Laws, because the Republic wasn\u2019t anymore anything more then a word, \nand because only arbitrary power was actually left instead of government. The choice that \nwas left was only between civil war, which is the most horrid of evils, and the cold winter of \nretreat\u201d. Du Pont therefore resolved to being named by the Institut National a \u201ctravelling \nscholar for a stay in the United States of America\u201d, where he was expected to undertake \nbotanic and agronomic studies\u2026 but also planned \u2013 once again \u2013 to make physiocracy \nflourish, although through other means than those he had unsuccessfully used until then. \nDU PONT\u2019S ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURE \n\u201cSince, for this mission, the Republic only (gave him) diploma, and no money, (he set up) the \nmeans of paying for his trip\u201d, by planning to create an agricultural and commercial company \nin the United Statesvi. Du Pont\u2019s entrepreneurial project was thus at first a project by default, \ndictated by financial necessity. But he rapidly added positive motivations to the negative \nones. \nThe perspective of moving to the United States was indeed a source of renewed enthusiasm \nfor him. This appears clearly in the dozens of letters he sent from December 1797 to May \n1798 to his eldest son, Victor, who was then in Charleston as a member of the consular corps. \nDu Pont enthusiasm also in the growing width of his project: the necessary amount of capital \nfor his expected settlement in the US was first evaluated at one hundred thousand francs \n 9 \nbefore rising, only a few months later, to four million. Apprehended through the scope of the \ndescriptions and narrations that had been made by travellers he had met or read, the seemingly \nvirgin American land was deeply attractive to him, allowing him to hope for better days. \nFinally, Du Pont\u2019s admiration for the founding fathers of the United States, as well as for the \nconstitution they had written and about which he had tried to give them his advice \n(Franklin, 1866; Jefferson, Du Pont de Nemours & Chinard, 1931), contributed to his \nenthusiasm. He had been impressed by the ideas and personalities of men such as Franklin \nand Jefferson, whom he had both met during visits they had made to Paris in the previous \ndecades, and he was willing to see them again, as well as the Republic their minds had built. \nThe call of America thus participated in stimulating new hope, for Du Pont as for many others \nbefore and after him. The opportunity to reform his homeland was thus widely compensated \nin his mind by this idea that there was a place on earth where he could undertake radically \ncreative actions, free of constraints. \nThe man, from then on, was bound to design the future through new means. But he didn\u2019t \nrenounce his political and economic ideals. This appears clearly in the project he devised in \nthe last months of 1797, while he was still in France. \u201cWe will do the trade of France, Spain, \nthe West Indies, Mauritius, etc. In the interior, (we will do the trade of) buying and reselling \nland, education, buying and reselling cattle, salted meats, cheese, butter, etc. The best hopes \nof the company will be put in this interior commerce of food, because it does not have to fear \ncorsairs and brings back actual money. (\u2026) It seems that we will locate our trading house in \nAlexandria, our rural house in the counties of Hampshire or (Lardies) in Upper Virginia on \nthe South Branch of the Potowmack\u201dvii. As one can see, Du Pont\u2019s physiocratic doctrine \nguided his business action in its overall structure: wealth was meant to come exclusively from \nthe agricultural production of a \u201crural house\u201d, but it could not be valued without an intense \ncommercial activity, just as Quesnay had stated it when he counted traders in the \u201cfertile \nclass\u201d of population (Steiner, 2000:620). Although he had to act in a new way, Du Pont \ntherefore kept his physiocratic ideals. And he even kept wanting, not only to respect \nphysiocratic principles, but to perform a whole physiocratic economy. Indeed, combining \nboth the businesses he was planning to undertake, Du Pont, who enjoyed turning his name \ninto an adjective, intended to found a real \u201cPontian colony\u201d. \nFrom his correspondence, it is possible to date the Extract of a plan for a rural and \ncommercial operation to be realised in the United States of America \u2013 from which the \nfollowing excerpts are taken \u2013 to as early as November 1797: \u201cOn the outskirts of our lands, \nwe will buy a farm and some cleared up land. This will be the main rural establishment and \nthe head of family operations. We will call land-clearers, and we will make them settle by \npromising land and cattle. (\u2026) We will immediately raise a lot of cattle, because their \neducation requires few hands (\u2026). We will spread amongst neighbours various rural \nindustries, so that they love us, and to multiply butter, cheese, the preparation of salted and \nsmoked meats, that we will sell either for cash or for other goods. We will establish a store in \nthe valley, with all the objects that will be necessary to the everyday life of the land. (\u2026) The \n3rd or 4th year we will place a tavern in its most busy part (\u2026). In five or six years, we will \nestablish a school where Virginians will be much more willing to send their children than in \nEurope (\u2026). On the 7th or 8th year, we will build a perfectly non-flammable house, made of \nstone, bricks and iron, for the conservation of acts of interest to families, and the various title \ndeeds. This depot will bring to the city founded by the company the constituted authorities. \nThus, the main establishment of the company will become the capital city of the county, and \nmaybe one day of the state, the situation of the land, its size, its possible population, and the \nlaws of the country authorizing us to hope so. Then would the prosperity rise to an \nincalculable level\u201dviii. As one can see, the spatial and temporal scope of the enterprise was \n 10 \nthat of a utopia which, over the XVIIIth century, had become a common place literary genre, \nclosely related to the practice of colony planning that was also thriving at the time (Pacquot, \n2007)ix. Du Pont established on paper a whole, small-scale society, listed its components, \narticulated them with one another, and thus conceived a complete and efficient social system, \nthat deserved a prosperous future. Such a representation of the future was a real attractor for \nhim: it was because he succeeded in figuring out his America that the potentialities he saw in \nher became meaningful to his eyes, and could drive his actionsx. \nHow efficient was this document? Its preparation did contribute to making Du Pont \nenthusiastic and active, for sure, but it was also destined to other actors, and especially \nfinanciers and merchants who could provide capital for the project. Presented in a neater and \nmore definite way in an Overview of a commercial establishment to be formed in America by \nthe Dupont de Nemours Fathers and Sons & Company, the plan indeed circulated in 1798 and \n1799 among potential shareholders. This version, slightly different from the previous one, \nnotably specified with much more clarity the financial structure of the establishment: \u201cThe \nsociety will last for 12 years. It will not be allowed to put together more than 400 shares of 10 \nthousand pounds each, to form the capital of 4 Millions. Each year, until the liquidation of the \nsociety, their will be stock dividend, for the interest of capitals, that will add to the generous \nbenefits of the enterprise. This dividend will amount to 4 per Cent for the 4 first years, 6 per \nCent for the 4 following years, and 8 per Cent for the four last. A (unreadable word) of 200 \nacres will be reserved for every shareholder, per share, at the price of primitive acquisition, \nand that every shareholder will use how he pleases\u201dxi. Du Pont thus conceived the financial \naspects of his plan in a purely calculative way, starting from a minimum dividend that \nequalled the maximum level long imposed to interest rates in Old Regime France (4 %) \n(Perrot, 1978). Such a document as this Overview seems at first to be a device proposing \nnothing more than seductive but unfounded promises to those it was destined to, i. e. \nfinanciers and merchants that could have been interested in becoming shareholders of the \ncompany. \nDu Pont did however try to remain relatively prudent, or so it seemed. In his letters to his son \nVictor, he showed a certain anxiety: he was impatient for his answers and advice, that only \nreached him in the spring of 1798. In the meantime, Du Pont told his son that: \u201c(he would) not \nfix (his) ideas on any of the said points, nor decide on (his) plans before having talked with \n(him)\u201d, because he felt he was not able to evaluate precisely from France the opportunities \noffered by the American landxii. As for Jefferson, whose prot\u00e9g\u00e9 he claimed to be, he didn\u2019t \neven dare write to him about his project at firstxiii. To fight his doubts, and with the help of his \nsecond and youngest son Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e, Du Pont gathered empirical information about American \nmarkets, in booksxiv, but also thanks to various stories he had heard through the American he \ncould meet in Paris. These descriptive and quantitative data were for instance the basis of his \ndecision on where to locate his settlement: \u201cthis valley can nourish seven hundred thousand \ninhabitants and it doesn\u2019t count twenty thousand. (\u2026) The still uncultivated earth of this \nvalley is of admirable quality, can cost to the company from only one piaster and a half to \nthree piasters, and be sold for up to eight to ten guineas. (\u2026) The house of commerce destined \nto vivify the rural establishments will be located in Alexandria. There, it will be less costly \nthan in Philadelphia, closer to the rural establishments, and also adequate for commercial \noperations. It will be possible when the time comes, to move it to Washington City where we \nalready envisage a few happy speculations on the location of houses, like those that made \nFranklin wealthy in Philadelphia\u201d. The mix of maps, data and stories that appears in this \nshort extract reveals how much Du Pont tried to present himself as sufficiently knowledgeable \nabout America. \n 11 \nIn spite of these efforts, the main guarantees the physiocrat offered for his promises were \npurely a matter of personal ties and reputations. First of all, trusting the project was trusting \nDu Pont himself, and this was meant to be encouraged by the fact that he and his family \n\u201c(were) known for being protected by Jefferson, vice-president of Congress, and Washington \ntheir common friend\u201d. Trust in the project was also meant to be encouraged by trust in its \nother contributors, whose names were listed as supplementary securities: \u201cMM. Dupont \nFather and Sons, his son-in-law Bureau de Pusy, La Fayette, Biderman, Beaumarchais, \nJohannot, La Tour Maubourg, Adrian Duquesnoy, Rousseau, Bisson Leloup, and Bellefond \nBourcard and Fourtaler & Company\u201d. Although some important members of this list finally \nbacked out (e.g. La Fayette and Rousseau), or died before they actually subscribed (e.g. \nBeaumarchais, however quick an investor he was), the document did enable Du Pont and his \nson Victor (who had just come back from the US) to raise some capital before leaving France: \nthey gathered a total of about one million francs, out of the four they had planned to getxv. It \nmust be underlined, though, that the economy that was thus performed by Du Pont remained \nnot so much one based exclusively on reciprocal economic interests than a truly political \neconomy, based on a hierarchical system of relations and reputations that he thought \nquintessential to the establishment of trust. \nThe outcome of Du Pont\u2019s venture suggests this mode of action didn\u2019t allow for success in \nbusiness. Having landed with his family on the American soil on January 3rd, 1800, Du Pont \nrapidly discovered, partly thanks to Jefferson \u2013 whom he had finally written to \u2013, that the \n\u201cvirgin\u201d lands of Virginia were in fact already subject to an intense speculation, and therefore \nfar too expensive for him to be able to buy any. Furthermore, the law forbade their being \nbought by a foreign citizen. And, finally, Du Pont admitted that the lands he had dreamed of \nbuying and settling on with fellow Frenchmen weren\u2019t really suited for such people: \u201cThe \nFrench don\u2019t like to travel, except in places where they can find good cooks, gay customs and \nloose talk\u201d (cited in Aim\u00e9-Azam, 1934:342). The physiocratic utopia could not be. Du Pont \ntherefore chose to limit his activities to their commercial part, and started writing various \nmemoirs, notably On the commerce of France with the United States and On the \nestablishment of ocean liners for the governmentxvi. His new project indeed consisted, partly, \nin organising secure maritime liaisons between France and the United States, especially for \nthe benefit of the French government, which for instance included providing supplies for the \nFrench Navy in Saint Domingue (Haiti). Du Pont thus went back to his previous speciality, \nworking for governmental actors, and trying to seduce them thanks to a political discourse on \nthe national interest of his project. But the French authorities were not interested the \nproposals, and Du Pont himself started to complain, from the first months of 1801, about how \nuninteresting business matters were to him now that his perspectives were deprived of the \npossibility to create a physiocratic colony. Renouncing progressively his entrepreneurial \nambitions, he went back to France in the spring of 1802. His efforts at performing \nphysiocracy from scratch through business enterprise in the US had also failed. \nEPILOGUE \nAs we have shown, what seems to be a real lack of success in the performation of physiocracy \nmay be widely explained by Du Pont\u2019s specific performative agency. His actions rarely \nenabled him to rally the people and things whose participation in his projects seemed \nnecessary: the landowners were reluctant to distribute revenues as he and his fellow \nphysiocrats prescribed; the Directoire was more in favour of industry than agriculture, which \nimpeded its receptivity to Du Pont\u2019s stance on liberty of activity and trade; financiers were \nreluctant to only trust his name and not know more about the foundations of his American \n 12 \nproject; the American land was hardly adequate to his dreams; etc. In all cases, it seems that \nDu Pont, along sometimes with his fellow physiocrats, failed to appeal to these people\u2019s \ninterests. He always acted, rather, by trying to impose onto others a future he had devised. \nForgetting partly about actual conditions and about the dispositions of the people he \naddressed, he focused instead steadily on his world-to-be. As long as actions were well \nthought of, i. e. defined deliberately in accordance with the so-called \u201cnatural laws\u201d, they \nwere bound, in his eyes, to succeed: one just needed to describe them to gain other people\u2019s \ninterests and the sovereign subject, guided by physiocracy, could therefore not fail. In \nDu Pont\u2019s eyes, as he confidently told his main shareholder in a letter from the United States \nwhere he presented his new projects of maritime commerce, \u201cmens agitat molem\u201d: mind \nmoves the massxvii. Quoting Virgile\u2019s \u00c6neidxviii, he thus admitted his belief in the capacity of \nideas, coming from a unique and divine source, to impose themselves bluntly and simply onto \nthe world. For him, agency was thus, in a way, pre-dispersed into the world: embedded in \ncontexts that only had to be stimulated by a knowledgeable actor to shift the way he wanted. \nThe only problem was that the principles of the \u201cnatural\u201d political economy Quesnay had first \ndescribed proved to be less \u201cnatural\u201d to other people, and even made little sense to many of \nthem. Nature had forgotten to expect Du Pont\u2019s actions, and physiocracy therefore couldn\u2019t \nemerge through mere political engineering. \nThe paradox of Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours\u2019 story is therefore that it has not been \nremembered as one of failure. This is due mainly to his son Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e who, having left France for \nthe United States with his father, devised his own business plan as soon as the fall of 1801: he \nwas willing to establish a \u201cmanufacture of sporting and war gunpowder\u201d, following what he \nhad learned while he was the young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of famous chemist Antoine Laurent \nde Lavoisier\u2019s at the state-owned company of powders, the \u201cR\u00e9gie des Poudres d\u2019Essonnes\u201d, \nten years earlier, from 1787 to 1790 (Bret, 1994; Dujarric de la Rivi\u00e8re, 1954; Tronc, 1994). \nPierre-Samuel did support his son\u2019s project financially but, at the outset, more because of the \nfailure of his own project than out of real enthusiasm. The father was obviously more \naffectionate with his eldest son Victor (whom he considered a \u201cchild of love\u201d) than with \nIr\u00e9n\u00e9e (the \u201cchild of reason\u201d), who was not very much into cultivating high-rank connections \nlike his father and sibling were. On top of that, the idea of his son creating a gunpowder \nmanufactory was not a source of great pleasure for a man who had always been a fervent \npacifist. Hence, when writing to Jefferson on behalf of his son to recommend his gunpowder \nfor the army, Du Pont only dared speak explicitly of \u201csporting gundpowder\u201d and insisted on \nthe fact that Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e had been named by his godfather \u2013 Turgot \u2013 after the greek word for \nPeace. Finally, the manufacture was nor an agricultural nor a commercial venture, and thus \ndidn\u2019t fit very well in the old physiocrat\u2019s principles. Even after his first American project had \nproved unsuccessful, he wrote to friends in France describing Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e\u2019s project as being only \nthe family\u2019s eighth in terms of importance. It\u2019s performative prospects were too meagre. \nYet, apart from a later period in 1810 when Du Pont momentarily turned against his son with \nhis other shareholders because he believed Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e should have paid them dividends, Du Pont \ntook on the gunpowder manufactory, which succeeded in surviving and paid most of the bills \nof the family \u2013 although with difficulty \u2013 from its launch to Pierre-Samuel\u2019s death in 1817. \nDu Pont endorsed and supported the project out of personal interest, but also, paradoxically, \nbecause it may have been the most physiocratic of all the business projects he had ever been \ninvolved in. The project was indeed adequate to much of Quesnay\u2019s doctrine, although it \nwasn\u2019t so because of Du Pont\u2019s influence but much more because of Lavoisier\u2019s. The famous \nchemist, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e\u2019s teacher, was a proclaimed physiocrat, for whom gunpowder manufacture \ncould foster agricultural production \u2013 that of saltpetre, or nitre, the main raw material needed \nfor such a production \u2013 just as the trading of grain did (Bensaude-Vincent, 1993; Dujarric \n 13 \nde la Rivi\u00e8re, 1949; Poirier, 1996). Moreover, Lavoisier was like Quesnay a keen follower of \nCondillac\u2019s sensualism, which prescribed a detailed attention to reality, and its accurate \nmeasurement whenever possible (Dagognet, 1973). When planning the establishment of his \nmanufacture, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e made efforts to anticipate thanks to accounting simulations not only the \namount of capital he needed \u2013 like his father had done for his own project \u2013 but also of the \nrevenues the manufacture could actually yield in the following years. He notably visited other \nAmerican manufactures in order to do so. Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e thus performed physiocracy, while \nconceiving the manufacture, as an entrepreneur intent on measuring reality before making \nprospective calculationsxix. \nThe comparison between the two men is quite telling. Contrary to his father, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e seldom \nreferred to the doctrine of the \u201csect\u201d. A young, post-Revolutionary man, he also had less \nconnections and no reputation. He therefore had to act in a way different to his father\u2019s. \nAspiring only to domestic happiness, rather than envisioning the whole political economy, he \nwas compelled to act economically and planned his manufacture step by step, through the \nclose qualitative and quantitative observation of the contexts he wanted to settle in. He \nengaged into a thorough \u201cenquiry\u201d, in the course of which he progressively constructed his \naction and revised his plans (Dewey, 1938). And he found the tools \u2013 for instance synthetic \nprofit and loss statements \u2013 that enabled him to do so in his teacher Lavoisier\u2019s physiocracy, \nrather than in his father\u2019s. Less of a sovereign subject than Pierre Samuel, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e tried to read \nthe potential agency of things and people, comparing for instance closely the powder \nmanufacturing technologies he observed in America with those he had been taught about in \nFrance, in order to see on which one he had better to rely. Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e thus performed physiocracy, \nbut he did so in a very local, as well as extremely partial way: if he effectively enacted, in his \nconduct and manufacture, some founding physiocratic principles, he for instance had no effect \nwhatsoever on liberty of trade. \nYet, quite unexpectedly, this liberty of trade did become a reality in France a few years later. \nThe Restoration of monarchy that occurred in 1815 was indeed a blessing for the Physiocratic \ntheory and Du Pont, who had mostly turned towards the natural sciences after 1803, as well as \nworked at the Paris Chamber of commerce for a while. The fall of Napoleon was also that of \nthe \u201cneo-mercantilist industrialism\u201d he had promoted, and of the industrialists that supported \nsuch a doctrine. At the same time, one discovered that some of the ideas that the physiocrats \nhad restlessly defended for years had progressively been accepted as possible alternatives to \nNapoleonic policies. Embedded into formulas like \u201claisser-faire, laisser-passer\u201d that could \neasily circulate and be memorised, they had gained ground in some parts of society. Some of \nthe \u201cnatural laws\u201d, separately from one another, finally sounded somewhat \u201cnatural\u201d to more \npeople. Having long opposed the emperor and his approach to the economy, as well as served \nkings Louis XV and Louis XVI, Du Pont was considered a wise old man and was thus named \nin 1814 the Secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du gouvernement provisoire, in charge of the transition \nbetween the two regimes for a couple of weeks. There, without the noble landowners who had \nbeen been partly disempowered by the Revolution, he was able to contribute a little to the \n\u201crevaluation of the land property of notables\u201d, a fringe of population that would soon become \nthe basis of the new monarchy\u2026 and that had been defended from the start by the \nphysiocrats. Laws liberalising business and trade were also issued in the first months after the \nRestoration and, in spite of the strong rise in prices and the riots that came up consequently, \nmaking the setting up of taxes for foreign grain a political necessity, the liberty of commerce \ninside France became a long-lasting fact. \u201cThis political line is typical of the \u2018adaptations\u2019 \nthat the heritage of physiocracy underwent; it had been inherited as a doctrine and seen as a \ndogma of the \u2018sect\u2019, but was accepted pragmatically\u201d (D\u00e9mier, 1995:237). \n 14 \nThe performation of physiocracy by political engineering had failed but, with the Restoration \nand the advent of a \u201cdispersed subject\u201d favourable to segments of the \u201csect\u2019s\u201d doctrine, \nDu Pont participated before his death in the collective, \u201crepeated and errant process\u201d (Butler, \nthis issue) through which elements of the physiocratic doctrine were finally enacted. \nREFERENCES \nAIM\u00c9-AZAM D.

We consulted them in spring 2008 thanks to \nfunding from the French Agence Nationale pour la Recherche program on the \u201cSocio-technical supports of \nentrepreneurship\u201d (dir. Grossetti M. & Zalio .P.-P.). The documents from the Du Pont archives are referred to in \nthis article by the first letter of the collection they come from (L for the Longwood Manuscripts and W for the \nWinterthur Manuscripts), followed by the group number and the individual document number. \niv Du Pont developed this specific aspect of his thought lightheartedly some years later in: Du Pont de Nemours, \n1795. \nv Du Pont\u2019s recent nobility (dating back only to 1783) and his having worked for and defended two successive \nkings made him an obvious target for the Committee of Public Safety. \nvi Letter from Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours to his son Victor of November 29th, 1797 (EMHL, W2-504). \nvii Letter from Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours to his son Victor of December 28th, 1797 (EMHL, W2-514) \u2013 \nthe words that are underlined are underlined by Du Pont himself, who writes them in English and spells them \nthis way. Mauritius (L\u2019Isle de France) is probably known by Du Pont through one of his correspondents\u2019 text \n(Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, 1773). \nviii Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours, Extrait d\u2019un plan d\u2019une op\u00e9ration rurale et commerciale \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter dans \nles Etats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique, not dated (EMHL, L1-469). \nix A famous example of colony planning is the experience of the town of Asilum in Pennsylvania, built jointly in \nthe mid 1780\u2019s by American entrepreneurs and French noblemen fleeing the Republic, an experience Du Pont \nmust have been aware of and may well have used as a reference in his own colonial venture. \nx This is a model of action that Du Pont also carried out in his private life: the perspective of being allowed to \nmarry his first wife-to-be, who was raised in a higher class of society than his, was for instance what led him to \nmake moves towards the court. It is also the model of action we have already met in Du Pont\u2019s political \neconomy, where the natural order intervened as a stimulating outcome for political action. The conditions that \ndictated his conduct were always future conditions, as seen from his days, rather than the conditions he lived and \nhad been educated in. \nxi Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours, Apper\u00e7u sur l\u2019\u00e9tablissement commercial et rural que va former en \nAm\u00e9rique la Maison Dupont de Nemours P\u00e8re et Fils & Compagnie, not dated (EMHL, L1-471). \nxii Letter from Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours to his son Victor of March 17th, 1798 (EMHL, W2-526). \nxiii Letter from Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours to his son Victor of November 30th, 1798 (EMHL, W2-505). \nxiv E. g. in a \u201cTable of values, prices, wages, spendings, etc. attributed in the Northern United States to the \nworks, the products of agriculture or industry, etc. An extract from Larochefoucauld-Liancourt\u2019s travels\u201d \n 17 \n                                                                                                                                                   \n(EMHL, W2-5640).
