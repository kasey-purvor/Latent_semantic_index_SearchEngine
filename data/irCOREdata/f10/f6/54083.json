Sacks (1972) provides a very detailed theoretical case that would support such a contention, in which he argues that life-stages involve a value hierarchy and sets out how to divine whether a category is higher versus lower in such a value hierarchy than another related grouping. Thus, in agreement with Arnett (2004), we provisionally treat the value of attaining adult status as a given for the purposes of the current analysis. 2 The empirical analysis which follows focuses on some of the five conditions more than others. In particular, we leave to future empirical work the exploration of adulthood as a valued achievement (I).","cites":null},{"id":18452449,"title":"4 Source: Office of the Deputy Prime Minister,","authors":[],"date":"2004","doi":"10.1080\/1561426042000215650","raw":"4 Source: Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, 2004.","cites":null},{"id":18452450,"title":"8 Signs of a similar openness are also evident amongst researchers: Dwyer et al.,","authors":[],"date":"2003","doi":null,"raw":"8 Signs of a similar openness are also evident amongst researchers: Dwyer et al., (2003) argue that, as contemporary young people do not meet previous demographic criteria of adulthood,  this should prompt a reconceptualization of adult status, rather than treating them as making \u2018faulty\u2019 transitions. 9  Four additional criteria were distinguished in the data.

Although the current analysis has treated the accomplishment of adult status as a valued achievement, our conclusions do not require that it have a positive valence on all possible occasions. Gallie\u2019s (1964) appraisive condition does not require universal agreement on positive valence (e.g. \u2018democracy\u2019 in the USSR is unlikely to have been valued positively). Indeed, given the cut and thrust of contestation and dispute, we would expect instances where it is rhetorically prudent to reject adult status, even though the category normatively holds a positive value.

The current study challenges this coherence by \nexamining the disparity and variability in young people\u2019s selection of such criteria.  One \nhundred and fifty-six British 16-17 year olds were given four sentence completion cues \ncorresponding to four different contexts in which adult status might be contested.  Their \nqualitative responses were analysed to explore patterns whilst capturing some of its richness \nand diversity.  An astonishing amount of variability emerged, both within and between cued \ncontexts.  The implications of this variability for how the transition to adulthood is experienced \nare explored.  The argument is made that markers of the transition to adulthood are not merely \nreflective of the bio-psycho-social development of young people.  Rather, adulthood here is \nseen as an essentially contested concept, located within the discursive interactional environment \nin which young people participate.  \n \nKeywords: transition, adolescence, emerging adulthood, variability, discourse, rhetoric, \nessentially contested concepts \n \n 3\n\u2018CONTESTABLE ADULTHOOD\u2019: VARIABILITY AND \nDISPARITY IN MARKERS FOR NEGOTIATING THE \nTRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD \nINTRODUCTION  \nFrom a traditional perspective, one of the main goals of successful development \nduring adolescence is to ensure that young people are steered on a path into healthy \nadulthood (see for example, Adams, 2000).  Much focus is placed on the dynamic \nbiological, psychological and social influences which shape this transition.  The \nresearch tends to be on troubled and troubling youth, with a view to helping these \nyoung people resist the pull of behaviors such as drug, cigarette and alcohol use (e.g. \nMadu & Matla, 2003) and sexual activity (e.g. Besharov & Gardiner, 1997), even if \nsome of these are normative in adulthood.   \nIn the United Kingdom, understanding the ways young people make the transition to \nadult life has become a major government-funded research priority.  The Economic \nand Social Research Council (ESRC) recently completed a programme of research on \nyoung people which explored the support and resources they need to become effective \ncitizens, participating fully in society (see Catan, 2004).   \nAnother strand of research has focused on changes in the length and complexity of the \ntransition to adulthood in contemporary life.  For example, Furstenberg (2000) argues \nfor both an earlier entry into and a later exit from the transitional phase.  Meanwhile, \nthere is an increasing consensus within the field that radical social change has \ntransformed the transition to adulthood from a relatively clear-cut, linear pathway to a \ncomplex, fragmented and individualized process dependent on the ability of each \n 4\nyoung person to navigate their way through a set of landmark events (Furlong & \nCartmel, 1997; Dwyer & Wyn, 2001; Dwyer, Smith, Tyler & Wyn, 2003).  This \nobservation has led commentators, such as Galambos & Leadbeater (2000) and Wyn \n(2005), to charge researchers to place participants\u2019 voice at the centre of the research \nprocess in order to properly encapsulate the experience of life during these transitions.  \nContemporary sociological theorising takes our understanding one step further.  \nStrauber & Walther (2002) see the transition as not only prolonged and \ndestandardized but also uncertain and reversible.  This \u2018yo-yo-ization\u2019 of post-\ntraditional life-courses sees young people as having to manage shifts between \ndependency and independence and back to dependency, as a result of switching \ntrajectories, either through personal choice or forced, for example through \nunemployment or relationship breakdown (EGRIS, 2001).  From this perspective, \nchanging states of semi-dependency have replaced the dichotomy of dependency in \nyouth and autonomy in adulthood (Biggart & Walther, 2006), explaining why 18-25 \nyear olds tend to describe themselves as young and adult at the same time (du Bois-\nReymond & Stauber, 2005).   \nIn trying to understand this extended and heterogeneous life transition, the question \n\u201cwhen does adolescence end?\u201d  (Arnett & Taber, 1994) has become a key issue for \nresearch in the new millennium.  Arnett has undertaken a prolific series of studies \naddressing this issue.  His findings point to a consistent pattern, leading him to \nconclude that markers of the transition to adulthood are \u201cintangible, gradual, \npsychological and individualistic\u201d (Arnett, 1997 p. 15).  Arnett (2000) sees the time \nbetween adolescence and adulthood as being separate from either period, labelling \nthis new developmental stage \u2018emerging adulthood\u2019: an empirically distinguishable \n 5\nphase when young people see themselves as being too old to be adolescents but not \nyet fully-fledged adults.  This construct has begun to take hold, inspiring conferences \ntargeting it, survey instruments measuring it (Reifman, Arnett and Colwell, 2004) and \na tendency to use it unquestioningly as a synonym for the 18-25 age group (for \nexample Arnett & Jensen, 2002; Arnett, 2003; Arnett & Tanner, 2005; Lefkowitz, \n2005; Sinclair & Milner, 2005). Criticisms of Arnett\u2019s new stage, where they exist, \nhave tended to be from sociologists who feel that the importance of structural factors \nhave been downplayed (e.g. Bynner, 2005). \nResearch into emerging adulthood has highlighted that young adults reject traditional \nrole transitions in their conceptions of adulthood and instead place importance on \nresponsibility, decision making and autonomy (Arnett, 1997, 1998, 2003; Greene, \nWheatley, & Aldava, 1992).  In Arnett\u2019s (1997) fixed-choice questionnaire the item \n\u201cAccept responsibility for the consequences of your actions\u201d was the most popular of \nhis 40 items as being necessary for adulthood.  Cross-cultural replications of Arnett \n(1997, 2001, 2003) have revealed that this emphasis on responsibility and other \nmarkers of independence is not confined to white Americans (e.g. Mayseless & \nScharf, 2003; Facio & Micocci, 2003). Similar findings have been reported using \nqualitative, open-ended data-collection techniques (e.g. Arnett, 1998; Greene, \nWheatley & Aldava, 1992), leading to a consensus amongst many that the transition \nto adulthood is marked by a coherent set of criteria.  However, it is this picture of \ncoherence that the current paper seeks to challenge.  \nADULTHOOD AS AN \u2018ESSENTIALLY CONTESTED CONCEPT\u2019 \nIn this paper, we draw on the philosophy of Gallie (1962, 1964) to propose that \nadulthood is an \u2018essentially contested concept\u2019.  Gallie (1964 p. 161) lays out five \n 6\nconditions for what he calls essentially contested concepts. (I) the concept concerns a \nvalued achievement - it is \u2018appraisive\u2019; (II) it is comprised of a collection of features \nor elements - it is \u2018internally complex\u2019; (III) it is \u2018variously describable\u2019, in that there \nare many ways the concept can be defined, each giving primacy to different elements; \n(IV) changing circumstances elevate changing definitions of the concept to cultural \nascendancy (in a way that cannot be predicted in advance) - its depiction is \u2018open\u2019; \nand finally, (V) users of the concept show awareness that their formulations must be \ncontested against those of others, who employ a competing set\/ordering of criteria: it \nis \u2018used \u2026 both aggressively and defensively\u2019. \nGallie\u2019s (1964) applies his notion of essential contestability to a series of examples, \nincluding \u2018art\u2019, \u2018religion\u2019 and \u2018democracy\u2019.  However, his interest is predominantly \nphilosophical and historical rather than empirical.  To this end, he adds two additional \n\u201chistorically justifying conditions\u201d to these five \u201cdefining conditions\u201d (p. 177).  Our \nemphasis, however, is on the empirical investigation of young peoples\u2019 lives, \nprompting us to leave aside the two additional conditions and avoid too much \nphilosophical debate.  Before undertaking such an investigation, however, we would \nlike to highlight the contribution that conversation analysis and discursive psychology \ncan make to such an enterprise. \nBaker (1984) points out that during \u2018adolescence\u2019, persons can seriously be described, \nnot only as either \u2018child\u2019 or \u2018adult\u2019, but also as neither child nor adult - as something \n\u2018in between\u2019.  A similar quality of in-between-ness is proposed by Arnett (2000) as \none of the fundamental criteria of his emerging adulthood stage.  However, Baker \n(1984) takes a conversation analytic perspective to ponder the consequences of such \nin-between-ness for the management of \u201cbiographical identity\u201d (Baker, 1984 p. 305) \n 7\n(i.e. where one is in the life-course).  She argues that it is the very fuzziness of this \ncategorical boundary that makes biographical identity particularly in need of \nmanagement and, consequently, a particularly frequent topic of conversation for \npeople at this stage of the life-course.  Thus, the accomplishment of an \u2018adult\u2019 identity \nbecomes a kind of \u201cconversational program for \u2018adolescents\u2019 in our culture\u201d (Baker, \n1984 p. 306), involving the deployment of a range of markers that speakers treat as \nindicative of the biographical identity categories at stake (see Garfinkel, 1967: \u201cthe \ndocumentary method of interpretation\u201d).   \nThis leads us to propose that, not only is the category \u2018adulthood\u2019 an essentially \ncontestable concept, but also, any individual\u2019s membership of the category \u2018adult\u2019 is \nonly contestable during a certain period of the life-course.  Before and after this time, \nit would be ridiculous to claim (before) or deny (after) membership of the category.  \nThus, essential contestability provides our definition for this experientially \ndistinguishable stage of the lifespan.  This stage corresponds very closely to Arnett\u2019s \n(2000) \u2018emerging adulthood\u2019, but this is no accident: the period during which one\u2019s \nadult status can be seriously questioned, is liable to be closely tied to the period at \nwhich the answer to \u201cDo you think that you have reached adulthood?\u201d is more likely \nto be \u201cin some respects yes, in some respects no\u201d than either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d (Arnett, \n1997).  From our perspective though, this stage would be more appropriately named \n\u2018contestable adulthood\u2019: the period between adolescence and incontrovertible \nadulthood, when claims to adult status become matters of contention and dispute.   \nThe contestability of membership to the category \u2018adult\u2019 leads us from conversation \nanalysis to discursive psychology \u2013 the latter approach having made the rhetorical \nnature of discourse one of its distinguishing features.  Widdicombe (1998) maintains \n 8\nthat in everyday interaction, a great deal rides on the ascription and resistance of \ncategorizations, making categories a hotbed of negotiation and debate.  This, then, is \nGallie\u2019s (1964) appraisive element of essentially contested concepts (I).  Meanwhile \nEdwards (1997 p. 193) emphasizes that contrasting \u201cconceptual resources\u201d provide \nexactly the sort of \u201crhetorical affordances\u201d that allow people to manage \u201cthe action-\nperforming, accountability-oriented, rhetorical \u2018witcraft\u2019 of discourse.\u201d (The \u2018witcraft\u2019 \nthat Edwards is referring to here, is a conception by Billig (1996) which involves the \nart of argumentation and spirit of contention.)  This observation, highlights three of \nGallie\u2019s (1964) other conditions: the multiplicity of features comprising a concept \n(II); their status as alternatives for description (III); and their competitive \ndeployability in attacking and defending against contending positions (V).  \nThe above discussion requires that, in order to argue that the category \u2018adult\u2019 is \nessentially contestable at a certain stage of the life-course, the markers of adulthood \nmust be multiple, contradictory and rhetorically deployable1.  However, research \nwithin the Arnett paradigm has presented a very different picture \u2013 of a coherent and \ncohesive pattern of markers.  We have cause to question this representation, and turn \nto Potter & Wetherell\u2019s (1987) discursive critique of social psychology in order to do \nso.  They argue that the pre-coding of quantitative responses into a limited set of \noptions and the post-coding of qualitative responses into mutually exclusive broad \nthemes tends to suppress the variability and disparity of participants\u2019 responses.  We \npropose that the finding of coherence amongst the markers of the transition to \nadulthood might be just such an artefact.  This premise has led us to adopt an \nalternative analytic strategy towards the markers of adult status: designed to reveal \nrather than suppress multiplicity and inconsistency.  Here is where research into the \ntransition to adulthood and Gallie\u2019s philosophy can be mutually enriching.  We offer \n 9\nan empirical, rather than philosophical, investigation of some of Gallie\u2019s conditions2, \npresenting a practical application of essential contestability in one field of enquiry. \nMeanwhile, to a literature on emerging adulthood, which has come to conclusions \nabout the coherence of subjective markers of adult status, we offer an important \nchallenge: one which has extensive implications for understanding young people\u2019s \nlives during this period of the life-course. \n \nMETHOD \nPARTICIPANTS \nThe sample comprised of 158 British young people.  Of these 97 (62%) were aged 16 \nand 59 (38%) were aged 17. There were 84 (54%) females and 72 males (46%).  The \npupils all attended one large, co-educational high school in the North of England, \nconsidered broadly typical of its type.  On average, 50% of pupils at this school gain \n5+ A*-C GCSE grades, compared to the UK average of 55.7%3.   The school is \nsituated in a predominately white lower middle-class neighbourhood.  In the Index of \nMultiple Deprivation 2004, the area was ranked at 5,604 out of 32,482, where 1 was \nmost deprived and 32,482 the least deprived4.  The sample was recruited on a visit to \na local university.  The visit was open to all pupils of that age at the school, with the \naim of raising aspirations and encouraging greater participation in Higher Education \nfrom their region, where uptake is traditionally low.  It is not known how many of the \npupils intended to go on to University.  This sample was selected on the basis that \ntheir age and stage of educational transition would make the issues under \ninvestigation particularly live, relevant and consequential. \n 10\nMATERIALS \nParticipants were presented with six open-response stimuli - four sentence completion \ncues and two open-ended questions - as follows: \nQ1 You know you\u2019re an adult when \u2026  \nQ2 You stop being a child when ... \nQ3 Your parents treat you like an adult when ... \nQ4 Society treats you like an adult when ... \nQ5 What are the good things about growing up? \nQ6 What are the bad things about growing up? \nEach of these six stimuli was followed by half an A4 sheet of blank paper, allowing \nparticipants to write as much as they liked.  A front sheet to the questionnaire \nreassured participants that their responses would be anonymous and confidential, \noffering space, time and freedom from criticism.  It also included the researchers\u2019 \ndetails and contact information, to allow participants access to further information \nabout the study if they should wish it. \nPROCEDURE \nThe group of participants were approached during a lecture, which was part of their \nday\u2019s experience of a university environment.  After introducing themselves and their \ninterest in young people\u2019s ideas, the authors explained the questionnaire to the \nparticipants.  Participants were assured that their teachers would not read their \nresponses and that the study had nothing to do with their visit to the university.  \nParticipants were encouraged to spend as much time on each cue or question as they \nwished and to freely express themselves.  They were discouraged from talking during \ndata collection.  \n 11\nCODING, CATEGORISATION & ANALYTIC GOALS \nFor the purposes of the current analysis, only the responses to the four sentence \ncompletion cues were examined. \nThe aim of the current analysis was to capture some of the richness and diversity in \nthe data, whilst at the same time detecting patterns of variability both within and \nbetween participant responses to the stimuli.  To this effect, a non-exclusive coding \nstrategy was applied to the data, with responses being allocated any and all codes \nappropriate to their content.  This non-exclusive coding strategy contrasts with \nprevious qualitative analysis in the area, in which the entirety of a participant\u2019s \nresponse to an item is coded as a whole into a single discrete category5 (e.g. Tilton-\nWeaver, Vitunski & Galambos, 2001; Galambos, Barker & Tilton-Weaver, 2003).  A \nrandom sample of 5% of the scripts was examined together by two raters in order to \ndevelop an agreement on coding.  On completion of coding an inter-rater reliability \ntest showed an 83% concordance on a random sample of 30% of the scripts.  Two \nscripts were spoiled (1.26%) and subsequently dropped from the analysis, resulting in \na useable sample of 156 participants. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nAnalysis of the four sentence cues revealed 33 distinguishable criteria in the data.  \nBetween them, 1155 instances of such criteria were recorded.  Amongst the 156 \nparticipants in the study, only five individuals completed all four cue sentences using \nthe same criterion6.  The remaining 151 participants mentioned multiple criteria in \n 12\ntheir responses, up to a maximum of 16.  The mean number of criteria included in a \nparticipant\u2019s response to the sentence cues was 6.29 (SD = 2.60). \nThis is clearly a very different image of the transition to adulthood from that proposed \nby Arnett and followers (Arnett & Tanner, 2005).  Rather than focusing on the \nprominence of three similarly themed markers, we would argue that the range of \nmarkers mentioned by participants is one of the most striking features of the data.  \nThis initial observation points to both the internal complexity (II) and the alternative \ndescribability (III) of adulthood as a concept (Gallie, 1964). \nCATEGORIES OF CRITERIA: THEIR NATURE, FREQUENCY AND \nPATTERNING ACROSS CONTEXT  \nThe criteria discerned within the data were further analysed using the following \nprocedure: \n1 The sense of each individual criterion was explored qualitatively and \nillustrative examples were selected in order to build a detailed picture of \nwhat each entailed. \n2 The criteria were grouped with other, related, criteria into a series of seven \ncategories.  \n3 Frequencies of each criterion and category were recorded by cued context \nand in total.  \n4 These frequencies were then used to discern patterns within and between \nthe cued contexts. \n 13\nINDEPENDENCE \nThe most frequent category arising in the data overall was \u201cIndependence\u201d, which \nwas mentioned 339 times across all four cued contexts.  In order of frequency, this \ncategory was made up of responsibility, autonomy and decision making.  \nResponsibility (153 mentions) was the most frequently arising criterion total (across \nthe four contexts).  Most often it was used with reference to \u201cyourself\u201d or \u201cyour \nactions\u201d.  For example, one 16-year-old male felt that childhood ends when \u201cyou take \nresponsibility for yourself\u201d(Q2),  whilst a 17-year-old male held that parents treat you \nas an adult when \u201cyou can show you can act responsibly\u201d(Q3).  Meanwhile, knowing \nyou are an adult occurs for one 16-year-old female when \u201cyou are given the \nresponsibility to do what you want\u201d (Q1). \nThe responsibility theme appeared not only as a singular noun, but also as a plural \nnoun, an adjective and an adverb.  This diversity, along with the phrasing surrounding \nthe term, may be of significance.  There may be quite different implications and \nconsequences, if as in the data above, responsibility is seen as something you \u201care \ngiven\u201d versus something you \u201ctake\u201d or something you \u201cshow\u201d.  Such diversity within \neven a single criterion would, we suggest, merit further analysis beyond the scope of \nthe current article. \nAutonomy (109 mentions) was particularly highlighted with reference to independent \naction and not relying on others.  For example, according to one 16-year-old male, \nyou know you are an adult when \u201cYou can do things on your own and think \nindependently without needing help all the time from others\u201d (Q1), whilst a 16-year-\nold female felt you know when you  \u201cTake control of your life and don\u2019t rely on \nanyone for anything\u201d (Q1). \n 14\nWith decision making (77 mentions), the emphasis fell heavily upon the opportunity \nto make one\u2019s own decisions.  Thus, a 16-year-old male equates adult status with \nwhen \u201c\u2026 you are allowed to say what you do with your life \u2026\u201d (Q1) whilst, for a 17-\nyear-old male, parents\u2019 treatment as an adult occurs when \u201cThey respect your \ndecisions and don\u2019t tell you what to do or try to influence you into doing something \nyou don\u2019t want to\u201d (Q3). \nImplications: Independence \nAmongst these three markers of independence, a clear pattern of response between the \nfour contexts emerged.  Responsibility was in the top five responses for all four cued \ncontexts and thus a very popular theme.  However, it appeared almost three times \nmore often in the Adult context than in the Society context..  Autonomy and decision \nmaking also appeared with great frequency in most contexts.  However, almost no \nmention of either marker was made in the Society context.  \nOn the face of it, such findings concur with much of the previous American and cross-\ncultural literature in the field (e.g. Arnett, 1994, 1998, 2004; Arnett & Galambos, \n2003; Greene & Wheatley, 1992).  However, when a range of contexts is offered to \nparticipants, and open responses are elicited, some of the internal complexity (II) and \nvarying describability (III) of even these major criteria is revealed.  When asked about \nsociety\u2019s acceptance of one\u2019s adult status, as opposed to knowing your status yourself \nor being treated as an adult by one\u2019s parents, the importance of all three criteria of \nindependence diminishes radically (to almost zero7 in the case of two of the three \ncriteria).  \n 15\nQUALITIES \nThe second most prevalent category of response from the four contexts was \n\u201cQualities\u201d (224 mentions).  This was made up of five core qualities cited as denoting \nadult status.  The most frequent was actions (112 mentions), which was the third most \nfrequent criterion total.  Actions included both the ability to \u201cact like\u201d an adult and a \nrange of actions exemplifying the status.  For example, one 16-year-old female \ndescribed that parents treat you like an adults when \u201cYou start acting like one, in their \neyes.  They treat you as an adult when your behaviour coincides with their ideas of \nhow an adult behaves\u201d (Q3), whilst a 17-year-old male felt that you stop being a child \nwhen \u201cYou stop watching children\u2019s television \u2026\u201d (Q2). \nThe next most frequently mentioned quality was competence (64 mentions), in which \na wide variety of abilities was cited as being indicative of adulthood, including \u201cYou \nuse your own initiative\u201d (male, age 16 Q1), \u201c\u2026 are able to distinguish between \nimportant things and trivialities\u201d (female, age 17, Q2),  \u201c\u2026have some self-control\u201d \n(male, age 17, Q4) and  \u201cYou learn to question what society and adulthood are \u2026\u201d \n(male, age 16, Q4). \nThis was followed in frequency by feelings (27 mentions) - either feeling \u201clike an \nadult\u201d or feelings presented as implying adultness.  For example, one 17-year-old \nfemale explained that you know when you\u2019re an adult when \u201cYou feel confident \nenough to face situations and people you would have found difficult before\u201d (Q1), \nwhilst another described how \u201cyou feel good about your life and environment\u201d (Q1). \nThe specific adult quality of respect for others appeared 16 times, both in relation to \nparents \u201cYou show them respect \u2026\u201d (female, age 16, Q3) but also society \u201c\u2026 treat \nsociety with respect\u201d (female, age 17, Q4).  Although not arising very often, the \n 16\ncriterion \u201cYou Prove It\u201d (11 mentions) captured allusions to qualities that could \ndemonstrate adult status, as one 16-year-old explained \u201c\u2026 you sometimes have to \nprove this maturity\u201d (Q3).  Finally, the quality of experience was occasionally cited (5 \nmentions), as this 16-year-old male eloquently states \u201c\u2026 when you can define \ninnocence from experience and consider yourself the latter\u2026\u201d (Q2). \nImplications: Qualities \nIn the two contexts which asked when third parties \u201ctreat you like an adult\u201d, actions \nwere frequently proposed as markers of adult status: actions were the most frequent \ncriterion cited in the Parents context and the third most frequent in the Society \ncontext.  However, in the remaining two contexts, where participants were asked \nabout self-judgements of adult status, very few actions were proposed.  \nCompetence was the fifth most frequent criterion for self-judgements of Adult status \nbut rarely mentioned in the Parents or Society contexts.  Feelings, meanwhile, were \nonly frequently cited in the Adult context. \nWhen qualities are compared between the four contexts it appears that you know you \nare an adult when you possess certain competences or feelings, but you are treated as \nan adult when your actions denote your status.  This again highlights the markers of \nadulthood as \u201crhetorical affordances\u201d (Edwards, 1997) rather than objective \nguideposts.  Qualities such as competences and feelings appear particularly effective \nfor arguing that you \u201cknow you\u2019re an adult\u201d, whilst highlighting the quality of your \nactions seems equally well designed for arguing that others should treat you as one.  \nThis finding is again highly supportive of adult status as an essentially contested \nconcept: with a variety of characterisations (II), any of which can be given \nprominence (III).  These findings also suggest that there may be competitive debate as \n 17\nto their applicability (V), indeed, a few participants even explicitly acknowledged the \ndefensive power of qualities by highlighting the need to \u201cprove\u201d your maturity\/adult \nstatus. \nCHRONOLOGY  \nChronological markers were another frequent category of response to the four \ncontexts (223 mentions).  These were made up of statements of a particular age and \nthe proposal of a range of social and legal age restrictions.  \nOf the 118 specific mentions of age, 18 years was most often proposed (83% of age \nresponses).  However, other ages were also cited.  Of these, only 16 and 21 years \nappeared more than once (7 and 3 times, respectively), whilst 3, 14, 15, 17, 20, 24, 32, \n35, and 83 years were mentioned once each. \nIn some cases (8 mentions), no specific age was stated, instead, age markers were \nsimply highlighted as relevant.  For example, childhood ending when you \u201cPass \nvarious ages\u201d (male, age 16, Q2) or society treating you as an adult when \u201cYou are \nthe right age\u201d ( female, age 16, Q4). \nReference to some sort of age restriction was the fifth most frequent theme in the data \n(105 mentions).  Sometimes a single age restriction was presented but, more usually, a \nseries of them were listed in the same response, quite often with a relevant age for \neach restriction given alongside it.  So, for example, you know you are an adult when \n\u201cyou can drive, vote, pay tax \u2026\u201d (male, age 17, Q1), or society treats you as one \nwhen  \u201cYou turn a certain age at 16 - smoke, have sex ,17 - drive, 18 - vote all of \nwhich slow change you from being a child to becoming an adult\u201d (female, age 16, \nQ4). \n 18\nImplications: Chronology \nAge appears to be an important marker in all four contexts studied, being cited \namongst the top 10 for each and the second most frequent criterion mentioned overall.  \nHowever, it appeared more than three times as often in the Society context as in the \nothers, and was the most cited criterion for Society in the data.  \nAge has not previously been highlighted as an important subjective criterion of \nemerging adulthood.  Most notably, in the Arnett questionnaire paradigm, the \nrelatively low endorsement of the items \u201cReached age 18\u201d and \u201cReached age 21\u201d in \ncomparison to criteria relating to independence, has contributed to the individualistic, \nintangible and psychological conception of the transition (e.g. Arnett, 1998).  \nHowever, perhaps endorsement of an age attained, as in our data, rather than dividing \nresponses according to which age is attained, would provide a clearer picture of the \nimportance of age as a criterion.  No data is available from the Arnett paradigm \narticles indicating how many of a sample endorsed at least one \u201cReached age \u2026\u201d \noption. The current findings suggest that such information may reveal that the \nimportance of age has been underestimated.  \nHowever, an emphasis on the contestability of adulthood suggests that there are other \ndetails of note in these findings.  Firstly, perhaps the overall preponderance of \nchronology is a product of the age of our participants \u2013 83% of those who mentioned \nan age chose 18, and it seems no coincidence that this is an age they are just about to \nattain!  Secondly, we again see a notable difference between the cued contexts, and \nthus both internal complexity (II) and varying describability (III) for the concept of \nadulthood.  Age is clearly seen as a priority for Society\u2019s treatment as an adult, but not \nquite so crucial to the other contexts.  \n 19\nThere was a high endorsement of Age restrictions in two of the four contexts \u2013 \nSociety (second most endorsed) and Adult (third most endorsed) \u2013 but it was \nmentioned ten or less times in the other two contexts (at least a quarter as often).  \nSuch diversity again points to the internal complexity of the concept of adulthood (II), \nand the variable applicability of its measures (III).  This suggests that the criteria \nfound in our data should be seen as resources for arguing people into and out of the \ncategory adult, rather than as simple markers on a journey to maturity. \nCONDUCT OF OTHERS  \nParticipants particularly noted three main ways in which the conduct of others around \nthem constituted markers of adult status: treatment by others, trust and respect from \nothers. \nTreatment by others (47 mentions) was most often cited in the general context of \nbeing (or not being) \u201ctreated like\u201d an adult\/child.  One 16-year-old male declared that \n\u201cYou are old enough to start [to] be treated less like a child and be appreciated more\u201d \n(Q1), whilst a 17-year-old male resolved \u201cI\u2019ll leave home so they can\u2019t treat me like a \nchild\u201d (Q3).  However, some specific examples of treatment indicative of adult or \nchild status also appeared: \u201cYou are not told what to do all the time\u201d (male, age 16, \nQ1); \u201cPeople start giving you freedom\u201d (female, age 16, Q2).  \nTrust (32 mentions) was such a common variety of treatment by others that it merits \nseparate examination.  Two female responses to when parents treat you as an adult, \nwere: \u201cThey can then trust you to take part in activities e.g. weekends away with your \nfriends.\u201d (age 16, Q3) and \u201cYou show you can be trusted by being responsible and \ntrustworthy.  For example, they lend you the car and it comes back in one piece.\u201d (age \n17, Q3). \n 20\nRespect from others (25 mentions) also appeared frequently enough to warrant \nseparate scrutiny.  One 16-year-old female felt that parents treat you like an adult \nwhen \u201cyou gain respect for good decisions you have made\u201d (Q3), whilst a male of the \nsame age highlighted that you stop being a child when people \u201c\u2026 respect your \nopinions\u201d (Q2).  \nImplications: Conduct of Others \nTreatment by others was not frequently mentioned in response to either the Parents or \nthe Society context (6 or less times).  This is unsurprising, given that both sentence \ncues already target others who \u201ctreat you as an adult\u201d.  Nevertheless, it was quite \noften endorsed in the remaining two contexts.  Both respect for others and trust were \ncommon themes in the Parents context, however, they appeared only very \ninfrequently in the other contexts (6 times or less).   \nWhen our participants choose the conduct of others as a criterion marking the \ntransition to adulthood, they are locating the transition in inter-personal space, rather \nthan the inter-psychic space that has been the usual focus of developmental \npsychologists.  Instead of indexing the cognitions\/behavior of those in transition as \nmarkers, they point to the cognitions (such as trust or respect) and behavior \n(specifically treatment) of others with whom they interact.  We suspect that \nreferencing the cognitions and actions of others in this way might prove particularly \neffective for making rhetorical contrasts when juxtaposed with young peoples\u2019 own \ncognitions and actions.  \nHere, for example, is the entirety of one 17-year-old male\u2019s response to the first cue: \nyou know you are an adult when \u201cyou are given a significantly greater amount of \nresponsibility than previously.  The difference in the way people treat you - family \n 21\nand friends or otherwise.  You feel as though you should be treated differently and \ncan justify this.\u201d The first detail to note is the way that responsibility is packaged. \nWhen Arnett (1997, p. 15) considers responsibility and his other two most frequently \nendorsed questionnaire items, he offers the following conclusion: that such markers \nare \u201cprocesses that are largely internal and psychological \u2026 and the ultimate \nattainment of them is \u2026 a judgement that individuals make largely for themselves \nrather than one that is conferred upon them by others.\u201d  In the above response, our \nparticipant contradicts such a conclusion, presenting responsibility precisely as \nsomething that is conferred by others.  Following this, in the second of his two \nsentences we see other people\u2019s conduct juxtaposed with your own feelings about that \nconduct, in a way that displays some contrastive tension between the two.  Finally, to \nlink these two alternative markers together, a third marker is referenced with \u201cyou can \njustify this\u201d.  This is a marker of competence, tellingly, the competence to engage in \ninterpersonal rhetoric: the ability to persuade others that your feelings about inclusion \nare legitimate grounds for their actions to include you.  Gallie\u2019s fifth condition for \nessentially contested concepts (1964 p. 161) involves the requirement \u201cto recognize \nthat one\u2019s own use of it has to be maintained against \u2026 other uses\u201d.  The above \nparticipant\u2019s reference to the ability to \u201cjustify this\u201d provides an excellent empirical \nexample of just such a recognition.  Our findings concerning the conduct of others \nthus provide further support for the contestability of adult status for young people. \nDEVELOPMENT \nThe notable developmental markers cited across the four contexts (91 mentions) were \nall concerned with maturity.  Although a number of citations made no specification as \nto what attributes were mature (14 mentions), most specified either behavioral\/mental \nmaturity (50 mentions) or physical maturity (27 mentions).  \n 22\nBehavioral\/mental maturity was most often expressed with reference to being \n\u201cmentally mature\u201d or tending to \u201cact mature\u201d, although sometimes particular \nacts or cognitions were specified, as this 17-year-old male explained, \u201cYou can \nsee things and discuss them with a more mature attitude\u201d (Q1).  References to \nphysical maturity tended to fall into two types \u2013 firstly pubertal signs, for \nexample \u201cHair in strange places \u2026 body parts become rather large\u201d (male, age \n16, Q1), and secondly looking older in general, for example \u201cWhen you \u2018look\u2019 \nlike a respectable person (outward maturity)\u201d (male, age 17, Q4). \nImplications: Development \nWhen all three types of maturity are taken together, they were most prevalent in the \nChild context, making up the second most common criterion for that context.  When \nthe total appearance of maturity is looked at in the other three contexts, we also see \nquite high frequencies \u2013 from fourth highest in Society to ninth highest in Adult.  This \nresulted in maturity ranking as the sixth most frequently appearing total.  \nHowever, finding that this criterion was generally important to our sample does not \nmean responses were uniform.  For example, it was very rare for physical maturity to \nbe mentioned in the Parents context (2 mentions), whereas behavioral\/mental maturity \nwas, on its own, the sixth highest criterion for that context.  Once again, qualitative \nanalysis which captures the richness and variety of meanings for a criterion leaves one \nwary of making generalisations which obscure the room for contention.  Clearly, \nresearch is warranted which examines how the various characterizations of maturity \nare utilized rhetorically, whether in contrast to other markers (e.g. one\u2019s age versus \none\u2019s maturity), or whether one interpretation of maturity is juxtaposed with another \n(e.g. physical versus behavioral maturity).  \n 23\nDEMOGRAPHY \nFour demographic markers of adulthood arose in the data, although with low \nfrequencies (77 mentions).  These were education & work; leaving home; sexual \nstatus; and marriage.   \nEducation & work taken together made up the most frequently cited of the \ndemographic markers (39 mentions).  For example, this 16-year-old girl stated that for \nher, society treats you like an adult, \u201c\u2026 When you are in work\/respectable job and are \nno longer in education.  As a school student society treats you as a child.\u201d (Q4).   \nLeaving home (16 mentions) was a second demographic marker, for example \u201cWhen \nyou\u2019re not living with your parents (you don\u2019t get treated like a child when this \nhappens)\u201d (female, age 17, Q1)  \nThe way that sexual activity (also appearing 16 times) was referred to in the data \nsuggested that it should be categorized as a demographic marker, as demonstrated \nhere by a 16-year-old female \u201cYou lose your virginity and enter into a sexual \nrelationship.  That is the last tie to break from childhood\u201d (Q2).  This 17-year-old \nmale wrote how society treats you like an adult when \u201cIt recognizes your right to \nconsent to sexual intercourse\u201d (Q4).  Finally, marriage was mentioned only six times \nin the data set. \nImplications: Demography \nThe only demographic marker that emerged with any frequency was education & \nwork.  It was more likely to appear in the Society context than in the other cued \ncontexts.  In line with other research in this area (e.g. Arnett, 2000), none of the other \n 24\ndemographic markers that appeared in the data occurred very often in any given \ncontext.  \nIt would be easy to infer that these findings reflect some sort of value system where \ntraditional, civic-minded milestones are no longer important aspirations for young \npeople.  In contrast, we argue that our data does not measure whether these things \nmatter to young people, but rather that such demographic criteria were not deployed \nby our participants to mark the transition to adulthood.  From our analytic approach it \nis suggested that the participants in this study may be eager to prove their readiness to \njoin the adult \u2018club\u2019.  Thus, they may choose intangible markers of adulthood such as \n\u2018acting responsibly\u2019 precisely because they stand a chance of demonstrating them in \nthe here and now.  In contrast, markers such as marriage and leaving home are likely \nto place our sample of school attending 16-17 year olds firmly outside the \u2018club\u2019.  \nFurthermore, their contemplation of entry to university (evidenced by the visit from \nwhich they were recruited) is liable to place the attainment of such markers way into \nthe future.  \nGallie\u2019s (1964) fourth condition for essentially contested concepts involves its \n\u2018openness\u2019, whereby changing historical circumstances bring differing definitions to \nthe fore.  The current analysis has not thus far considered this condition, \npredominantly because our sample does not include any historical data with which to \ncompare the contemporary responses.  However, the finding of generally low \nfrequencies of demographic markers, suggests that openness is at work.  It may be \nthat the delayed achievement of previously relevant demographic markers (Bynner, \n2005; Furlong & Cartmel, 1997) has devalued their usefulness as indicators of adult \nstatus for our young sample8.  \n 25\nRESISTANCE & EXPEDIENCY \nThe sentence cue for each of the four contexts was phrased so as to elicit markers of a \ntransformation from childhood to adulthood.  However, a number of participants \nresisted the implicit assumption in these cues of the \u2018fact\u2019 that such a transformation \nexits (62 mentions).  They either rejected the transformation itself, or suggested that \nthe transformation could be made at will, as a means to an end: for either others\u2019 \nexpediency or one\u2019s own expediency. \nOf those that rejected the transformation from child to adult (40 mentions), many said \nadulthood \u201cnever\u201d occurred, while others said that only a partial transformation \noccurred.  For example, asked when you stop being a child, this 16-year old female \nwrote \u201cnever, you are always slightly childish\u201d (Q2) and in reply to the parent prompt, \nthis 17-year old female replied, \u201cYou\u2019re always a child to them, never a \u2018full\u2019 adult.\u201d \n(Q3). \nThe second way in which the fact of a transformation was rejected was through \ncharacterising it as purpose driven rather than externally marked.  Some participants \nsuggested that entry into the status of adulthood occurred due to others\u2019 expediency \n(16 mentions): \u201cThey want something\u201d (male, age 17, Q3) or \u201cwhen it feels like it - \nwhen it benefits society\u201d (female, age 17, Q4).  A small group suggested that adult \nstatus could be claimed according to one\u2019s own expediency (6 mentions), as these two \nyoung people explain \u201cWhenever you want to - hopefully never!\u201d (female, age 17, \nQ2) and \u201cEveryone can put on a more adult front to get what they want from society\u201d \n(female, age 16, Q4). \n 26\nImplications: Resistance & expediency \nResponses that rejected the transformation from child to adult were particularly \napparent in the Child context (fifth most frequent criterion) and quite common in the \nParents context (seventh most frequent criterion), but infrequent in the other two \ncontexts.  Such references to the incomplete or non- entry into adulthood indicate, \nonce again, the contestability of the concept. \nExpediency was not a very common criterion overall, and indeed it was never \nmentioned in either the Adult or Child context.  However, its existence demonstrates \nan awareness, amongst at least some of our sample, that the adult construct is \nstrategically deployable (V), for them or for others9.  \n \nGENERAL DISCUSSION  \nFrom this very rich and complex data set three main points will be highlighted.  The \nmost important is the wide disparity and variability of markers expressed by the \nparticipants of this study, which lend themselves to essential contestability.  Secondly, \nthe findings suggest that the stage immediately prior to adulthood is best defined as \nthe period when adult status is contestable.  Thirdly, details within the findings show \nthat not only is adult status open to contestation, but so too are each of the criteria \nthemselves - some more than others.   \nDISPARITY, VARIABILITY & CONTESTABILITY \nThe multiplicity of the data is starkly demonstrated in that 97% of participants \nincluded two or more markers in their responses, with an average of over six per \nparticipant.  Importantly, this finding does not reflect a uniqueness in our data per se, \n 27\nbut demonstrates how analytic refocusing can bring to light what has previously been \nobscured.  For example, a reanalysis of Arnett\u2019s (1997) questionnaire responses \nwould indicate that, on average, participants affirmatively endorsed almost ten \ndifferent markers apiece10.  The wide range of markers mentioned by our participants \ntherefore supports our assertion that adulthood is an internally complex concept(I).  \nThe high incidence of intangible and idiosyncratic markers found in the current data, \nseems to support previous research (e.g. Arnett, 1997; 2000; Galambos, Kolaric, Sears \n& Maggs, 1999; Tilton-Weaver et al., 2001).  However, the coherence of this pattern \nis disrupted by similarly frequent citation of entirely tangible and normative cultural \nmarkers, i.e. chronological age and legal or institutional age restrictions.  What is \nmore, some of the ways in which our participants expressed these markers, when \ngiven free reign (rather than closed options), challenges conclusions about how \n\u201cinternal and psychological\u201d (Arnett, 1997) such markers are.  Responsibility, for \nexample, was conveyed in our data not just as an autonomous self-judgement, but also \nas contingent on the conduct of others. \nInconsistent responses between the four cued contexts reveal some of the variable \ndescribability (III) of the concept of adulthood and begin to suggest how these \nmarkers might be put to use \u2018aggressively and defensively\u2019 (V) in contesting adult \nstatus during interaction.  To summarize: in all four contexts responsibility was often \nhighlighted.  However, in the Society context this criterion appears much less useful \nfor arguing one\u2019s way into adult membership than referencing age, age restrictions, \nactions or maturity.  With respect to the Parents cue, participants pointed up \ndemonstrating adult status, in the form of actions, trust and maturity more than in the \nother contexts.  This suggests that such markers offer an especially strong rhetorical \n 28\npotential for contesting adult status with parents.  Knowing you are an Adult mostly \nmirrored previous findings as to the importance of independence.  However, a \nsimilarly high incidence of externally imposed age restrictions, challenges the \nassumption that the transition is subjectively determined.  Instead, room for \ncontention and contrast is opened up with self-judgements being juxtaposed against \nsocietal dictates.  Most notable in response to the Child cue was the number of \nparticipants who challenged the presumption in the cue that one does in any simple \nway \u2018stop being a child\u2019: it appears that even the implicit assumptions in our cues are \nopen to controversy and debate.  \nDiscrepant patterns of response between the contexts we explored thus suggest that, \nwhen participants respond that they are adult in some respects but not in others \n(Arnett, 1997; du Bois-Reymond & Stauber, 2005), they are referencing the internal \ncomplexity (II) and varying describability (III) of the concept of adulthood. \nCONTESTABLE ADULTHOOD \nHaving argued that the multiplicity and disparity of our data reflects the contestability \nof adult status, we wish to emphasize the consequences of this contestability for \nyoung people.  As Baker (1984) highlights, the exigencies of the dynamic, rhetorical \nenvironment of everyday interaction regularly impose on young people the \nrequirement to be ready and able to accountably claim (or deny) an adult status for \nthemselves, at any given moment of interaction.  Such a requirement therefore \npermeates the experience of this stage of the life-course, making it distinguishable \nfrom other stages.  It is a stage best characterized as \u2018contestable adulthood\u2019, rather \nthan emerging adulthood, as the latter suggests a rather inevitable transition, existing \noutside of rhetoric and social purpose.  The resources young people can use to \n 29\nmanage contestable adulthood are what our analysis has documented.  It now remains \nfor studies of situated discourse to examine precisely how such resources are put to \nuse and the pragmatic functions they achieve. \nCONTESTABLE INGREDIENTS \nIf we acknowledge that \u2018contestable adulthood\u2019 is a stage dominated by the need to \naccomplish an adult identity, we would expect people to make strategic replies to our \ncues.  In this light, it is not surprising that our sample have chosen intangible criteria \nthat tend to include them as adults, rather than criteria, such as full-time employment, \nmarriage and home ownership, which exclude them (now, for the foreseeable future \nor even permanently).  \nHowever, such intangible markers are a double-edged sword: young people can use \nthem to argue for inclusion in the adult category in the absence of more concrete \nmarkers but their very intangibility leaves enormous room for contest and debate.  \nThus, not only is the concept of adulthood itself inherently contestable, but so too are \nmany of its criteria11.  \nCONTESTABLE ADULTS IN INTERACTION \nIn conclusion, we propose that arguing one\u2019s way into adulthood is the central \noccupation for contestable adults.  What distinguishes this stage in the life-course is \nthe fact that, at any point, the individual can come under inspection for how far they \ndemonstrate \u2018adult\u2019 qualities.  Clearly there is a lot at stake in arguing oneself into \n(and out of12) adult status. So too is there much at stake for the other parties to the \ninteractions (e.g. parents and teachers) who may be denying or facilitating adult status \nin young people.  We recommend that explorations of the nature and texture of such \n 30\ninteractions would provide important insights into the lives of young people, \nanswering such questions as: what concrete uses are the markers of contestable \nadulthood put to; how is adult status then adjudicated (including investigations of \nyoung people\u2019s power over their membership status); and what are the consequences \nfor contestable adults of the continuous questioning of their adult status.  \n \nREFERENCES \nAdams, G.

Sacks (1972) provides a very detailed  \ntheoretical case that would support such a contention, in which he argues that life-stages involve a \nvalue hierarchy and sets out how to divine whether a category is higher versus lower in such a value \nhierarchy than another related grouping. Thus, in agreement with Arnett (2004), we provisionally treat \nthe value of attaining adult status as a given for the purposes of the current analysis. \n2 The empirical analysis which follows focuses on some of the five conditions more than others. In \nparticular, we leave to future empirical work the exploration of adulthood as a valued achievement (I).  \n3 Source: Department for Education & Skills, 2001-2005. \n4 Source: Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, 2004. \n 36\n                                                                                                                             \n5 Arnett (1998) uses a strategy that falls between these two extremes. As with our own strategy, Arnett \nallocates multiple codes to a given response. However, unlike the current strategy, he has pre-delimited \nthe scope of these multiple codes: they are the same 38 items from the questionnaire his participants \nalso received in the study. \n6  In four out of these five cases (three females and one male), every cue elicited the identical response \nof \u201cyou\u2019re 18\u201d. In the fifth case, age was also the criterion of response, but here, three different ages \nwere given across the four contexts \u2013 \u201c18\u201d for Adult, \u201c16\u201d for Child, \u201c20\u201d for Parents and \u201c18\u201d again \nfor Society. \n7 There were three mentions of decision making\/autonomy in the Society context. \n8 Signs of a similar openness are also evident amongst researchers: Dwyer et al., (2003) argue that, as \ncontemporary young people do not meet previous demographic criteria of adulthood,  this should \nprompt a reconceptualization of adult status, rather than treating them as making \u2018faulty\u2019 transitions. \n9  Four additional criteria were distinguished in the data. However, they fit into no obvious category \nand none were mentioned above 8 times by participants. \n10 Calculated by summing the percentages reported for each questionnaire item and dividing by the \nnumber of items. \n11 Connolly (1983) makes a similar point about the concept of politics. \n12 See Widdicombe & Wooffitt (1995) and Widdicombe (1998) for analyses of the interactional \nachievement of non-membership to social identity categories (in their case, of subcultural identities). \nAlthough the current analysis has treated the accomplishment of adult status as a valued achievement, \nour conclusions do not require that it have a positive valence on all possible occasions. Gallie\u2019s (1964) \nappraisive condition does not require universal agreement on positive valence (e.g. \u2018democracy\u2019 in the \nUSSR is unlikely to have been valued positively). Indeed, given the cut and thrust of contestation and \ndispute, we would expect instances where it is rhetorically prudent to reject adult status, even though \nthe category normatively holds a positive value. This expectation opens up another avenue for future \ninvestigation: when, how and why do young people sometimes resist being classed as adults? \n 37\n"}
