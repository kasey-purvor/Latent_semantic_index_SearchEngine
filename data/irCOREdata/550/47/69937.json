TOWERS\nDepartment of Mathematics, Lancaster University\nLancaster LA1 4YF, England\nEmail: d.towers@lancaster.ac.uk\nAbstract\nA subalgebra B of a Lie algebra L is called a c-ideal of L if there\nis an ideal C of L such that L = B + C and B \u2229 C \u2264 BL, where\nBL is the largest ideal of L contained in B. This is analogous to the\nconcept of c-normal subgroup, which has been studied by a number\nof authors. We obtain some properties of c-ideals and use them to\ngive some characterisations of solvable and supersolvable Lie algebras.\nWe also classify those Lie algebras in which every one-dimensional\nsubalgebra is a c-ideal.\nMathematics Subject Classification 2000: 17B05, 17B20, 17B30, 17B50.\nKey Words and Phrases: Lie algebras, c-ideal, nilpotent, solvable, su-\npersolvable, Frattini ideal.\n1 Introduction\nThroughout L will denote a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field F .\nIf B is a subalgebra of L we define BL, the core (with respect to L) of B\nto be the largest ideal of L contained in B. We say that a subalgebra B\nof L is a c-ideal of L if there is an ideal C of L such that L = B + C and\nB \u2229 C \u2264 BL. This is analogous to the concept of c-normal subgroup as\nintroduced by Wang in [10]; this concept has since been further studied by\n1\na number of authors, including Li and Guo ([5] and [6]), Jehad ([4]), Wang\n([11]), Wei ([12]) and Skiba ([7]).\nThe maximal subalgebras of a Lie algebra L and their relationship to the\nstructure of L have been studied extensively. It is known that L is nilpotent\nif and only if every maximal subalgebra of L is an ideal of L. A further result\nis that every maximal subalgebra of L has codimension one in L if and only\nif L is supersolvable. In this paper we obtain some similar characterisations\nof solvable and supersolvable Lie algebras in terms of c-ideals.\nA subalgebra B of L is a retract of L if there is an endomorphism \u03b8 : L\u2192\nL such that \u03b8(b) = b for all b \u2208 B and \u03b8(x) \u2208 B for all x \u2208 L. Such a map\n\u03b8 is called a retraction. Then it is easy to see that ideals of L and retracts\nof L are c-ideals of L; in the case of retracts the kernel of the retraction is\nan ideal that complements B. If F has characteristic zero then every Levi\nfactor of L is a c-ideal of L.\nIn section one we give some basic properties of c-ideals; in particular,\nit is shown that c-ideals inside the Frattini subalgebra of a Lie algebra L\nare necessarily ideals of L. In section two we first show that all maximal\nsubalgebras of L are c-ideals of L if and only if L is solvable. It is further\nshown that, over a field of characteristic zero or over an algebraically closed\nfield of characteristic p > 5, L has a solvable maximal subalgebra that is\na c-ideal if and only if L is solvable. Finally we have that if all maximal\nnilpotent subalgebras of L are c-ideals, or if all Cartan subalgebras of L are\nc-ideals and F has characteristic zero, then L is solvable.\nIn section three we show that if every maximal subalgebra of each max-\nimal nilpotent subalgebra of L is a c-ideal of L then L is supersolvable. If\neach of the maximal nilpotent subalgebras of L has dimension at least two\nthen the assumption of solvability can be removed. Similarly if the field has\ncharacteristic zero and L is not three-dimensional simple then this restric-\ntion can be removed. In the final section we classify those Lie algebras in\nwhich every one-dimensional subalgebra is a c-ideal.\nIf A and B are subalgebras of L for which L = A + B and A \u2229 B = 0\nwe will write L = A \u2295 B. The ideals L(k) and Lk are defined inductively\nby L(1) = L1 = L, L(k+1) = [L(k), L(k)], Lk+1 = [L,Lk] for k \u2265 1. If A is a\nsubalgebra of L, the centralizer of A in L is CL(A) = {x \u2208 L : [x,A] = 0}.\n2 Preliminary results\nFirst we give some basic properties of c-ideals.\n2\nLemma 2.1 (i) If B is a c-ideal of L and B \u2264 K \u2264 L then B is a c-ideal\nof K.\n(ii) If I is an ideal of L and I \u2264 B then B is a c-ideal of L if and only if\nB\/I is a c-ideal of L\/I.\nProof.\n(i) Suppose that B is a c-ideal of L and B \u2264 K \u2264 L. Then there is\nan ideal C of L with L = B + C and B \u2229 C \u2264 BL. It follows that\nK = (B + C) \u2229K = B + C \u2229K, where C \u2229K is an ideal of K and\nB \u2229 C \u2229K \u2264 BL \u2229K \u2264 BK , and so B is a c-ideal K.\n(ii) Suppose first that B\/I is a c-ideal of L\/I. Then there is an ideal C\/I\nof L\/I such that L\/I = B\/I + C\/I and (B\/I) \u2229 (C\/I) \u2264 (B\/I)L\/I =\nBL\/I. It follows that L = B + C, where C is an ideal of L and\nB \u2229 C \u2264 BL, whence B is a c-ideal of L.\nSuppose conversely that I is an ideal of L with I \u2264 B such that B is\na c-ideal of L. Then there is an ideal C of L such that L = B+C and\nB\u2229C \u2264 BL. Now L\/I = B\/I+(C+I)\/I, where (C+I)\/I is an ideal\nof L\/I and (B\/I) \u2229 (C + I)\/I = (B \u2229 (C + I))\/I = (I + B \u2229 C)\/I \u2264\nBL\/I = (B\/I)L\/I , so B\/I is a c-ideal of L\/I.\nThe Frattini subalgebra of L, F (L), is the intersection of all of the max-\nimal subalgebras of L. The Frattini ideal, \u03c6(L), of L is F (L)L. The next\nresult shows, in particular, that c-ideals inside the Frattini subalgebra of a\nLie algebra L are necessarily ideals of L.\nProposition 2.2 Let B,C be subalgebras of L with B \u2264 F (C). If B is a\nc-ideal of L then B is an ideal of L and B \u2264 \u03c6(L).\nProof. Suppose that L = B + K and B \u2229 K \u2264 BL. Then C = C \u2229 L =\nC \u2229 (B +K) = B + C \u2229K = C \u2229K since B \u2264 F (C). Hence B \u2264 C \u2264 K,\ngiving B = B \u2229 K \u2264 BL and B is an ideal of L. It then follows from [8,\nLemma 4.1] that B \u2264 \u03c6(L).\n3\n3 Some characterisations of solvable algebras\nTheorem 3.1 Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F . Then all maximal\nsubalgebras of L are c-ideals of L if and only if L is solvable.\nProof. Let L be a non-solvable Lie algebra of smallest dimension in which\nmaximal subalgebras are c-ideals of L. Then all proper factor algebras of L\nare solvable, by Lemma 2.1 (ii). Suppose first that L is simple. Let M be a\nmaximal subalgebra of L. Then M is a c-ideal so there is an ideal C of L\nsuch that L =M+C andM \u2229C \u2264ML = 0, as L is simple. This yields that\nC is a non-trivial proper ideal of L, a contradiction. If L has two minimal\nideals B1 and B2, then L\/B1 and L\/B2 are solvable and B1 \u2229B2 = 0, so L\nis solvable. Hence L has a unique minimal ideal B and L\/B is solvable.\nSuppose there is an element b \u2208 B such that adLb is not nilpotent. Let\nL = L0 \u2295 L1 be the Fitting decomposition of L relative to adLb. Then\nL 6= L0 so let M be a maximal subalgebra of L containing L0. As M is a\nc-ideal there is an ideal C of L such that L = M + C and M \u2229 C \u2264 ML.\nNow L1 \u2264 B so B 6\u2264 ML. It follows that ML = 0 whence M = L0 and\nB = C = L1. But b \u2208M \u2229B = 0. Hence every element of B is ad-nilpotent,\nyielding that B is nilpotent and so L is solvable, a contradiction.\nNow suppose that L is solvable and let M be a maximal subalgebra of\nL. Then there is a k \u2265 2 such that L(k) \u2264 M , but L(k\u22121) 6\u2264 M . We have\nthat L(k\u22121) is an ideal of L, L = M + L(k\u22121) and M \u2229 L(k\u22121) \u2264 ML, so M\nis a c-ideal of L.\nTheorem 3.2 Let L be a Lie algebra over a field F of characteristic zero.\nThen L has a solvable maximal subalgebra that is a c-ideal of L if and only\nif L is solvable.\nProof. Suppose first that L has a solvable maximal subalgebraM that is a c-\nideal of L. We show that L is solvable. Let L be a minimal counter-example.\nThen there is an ideal K of L such that L = M + K and M \u2229 K \u2264 ML.\nNow ML = 0, since otherwise, L\/ML is solvable and ML is solvable, whence\nL is solvable, a contradiction. It follows that L = M \u2295 K. If R is the\nsolvable radical of L then R \u2264ML = 0, so L is semisimple and L2 = L. But\nL2 \u2264M2 +K 6= L, a contradiction. The result follows.\nThe converse follows from Theorem 3.1.\nFor fields of characteristic p > 0 we have the following result.\n4\nTheorem 3.3 Let L be a Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field F\nof characteristic greater than 5. Then L has a solvable maximal subalgebra\nthat is a c-ideal of L if and only if L is solvable.\nProof. Suppose first that L has a solvable maximal subalgebra M that is\na c-ideal of L. We show that L is solvable. Let L be a minimal counter-\nexample. Then, as above, L = M \u2295 K and K is a minimal ideal of L.\nWe follow the contents of [13]: M defines a filtration in which L0 = M ,\nLi+1 = {x \u2208 Li : [x, L] = Li}. When L1 = 0 this filtration is called short;\notherwise it is long. Suppose first that it is short. Then, as in the first two\nparagraphs of the proof of [13, Theorem 2.2], L =\n\u2295\ni\u2208Zp Li, M = L0 and Li\nis an irreducible M -submodule of L for each i 6= 0. Moreover, since K is an\nideal of L, K =\n\u2295\n0 6=i\u2208Zp Li. Let S be the subalgebra generated by L1. Then\nS is spanned by commutators c(x1, . . . , xn) = [x1, [x2, . . . [xn\u22121, xn]] with\nxi \u2208 L1 and n \u2265 1. Now c(x1, . . . , xp) \u2208 M \u2229K = 0 for all x1, . . . , xp \u2208 L1,\nso S is nilpotent. AlsoM idealizes S, soM+S is a subalgebra of L, whence\nL = M + S and S is an ideal of L. It follows that K = S is nilpotent and\nL is solvable, a contradiction.\nNow suppose that the filtration is long. Then the nilradical, N , of M\nacts nilpotently on K, by [13, Proposition 2.5]. Let C = CK(N). Then\nC 6= 0 and M +C is a subalgebra of L. It follows that L =M +C, whence\nK = C.. But this means that N is an ideal of L, so that N \u2286ML = 0. We\nconclude that M = 0, a contradiction.\nThe converse follows from Theorem 3.1 as before.\nTheorem 3.4 Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F , such that all maximal\nnilpotent subalgebras of L are c-ideals of L. Then L is solvable.\nProof. Let N be the nilradical of L and let x \/\u2208 N . Then x \u2208 B for some\nmaximal nilpotent subalgebra B of L, and there is an ideal C of L such that\nL = B + C and B \u2229 C \u2264 BL. Clearly x \/\u2208 BL \u2264 N , so x \/\u2208 C. Moreover,\nL\/C \u223c= B\/(B \u2229 C) is nilpotent. So if x \/\u2208 N , there is an ideal C of L such\nthat x \/\u2208 C and L\/C is nilpotent.\nSo let x1 \/\u2208 N and let C1 be such an ideal with x1 \/\u2208 C1 and L\/C1\nnilpotent. If C1 \u2264 N we have finished. If not, then choose x2 \u2208 C1 \\ N\nand let C2 be such an ideal with x2 \/\u2208 C2 and L\/C2 nilpotent. Clearly dim\n(C1\u2229C2) < dim C1. If C1\u2229C2 6\u2264 N , choose x3 \u2208 (C1\u2229C2)\\N . Continuing\nin this way we find ideals C1, . . . , Cn of L such that C1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 Cn \u2264 N and\n5\nL\/Ci is nilpotent for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Since L\/(C1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 Cn) is solvable,\nthe result follows.\nTheorem 3.5 Let L be a Lie algebra, over a field F of characteristic zero,\nin which every Cartan subalgebra of L is a c-ideal of L. Then L is solvable.\nProof. Suppose that every Cartan subalgebra of L is a c-ideal of L, and\nthat L has a non-zero Levi factor S. Let H be a Cartan subalgebra of S\nand let B be a Cartan subalgebra of its centralizer in the solvable radical of\nL. Then C = H + B is a Cartan subalgebra of L (see [3]) and there is an\nideal K of L such that L = C +K and C \u2229K \u2264 CL. Now there is an r \u2265 2\nsuch that L(r) \u2264 K. But S \u2264 L(r) \u2264 K, so C \u2229 S \u2264 C \u2229 K \u2264 CL giving\nC \u2229 S \u2264 CL \u2229 S = 0, a contradiction. It follows that S = 0 and hence that\nL is solvable.\nNote: If L\u221e = \u2229\u221ei=1Li is abelian then the converse to the above theorem\nholds, by Theorem 4.4.1.1 of [14].\n4 Some characterisations of supersolvable algebras\nFirst we need some preliminary results concerning maximal nilpotent sub-\nalgebras of Lie algebras.\nLemma 4.1 Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F , let A be an ideal of L\nand let U\/A be a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L\/A. Then U = C + A,\nwhere C is a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L.\nProof. If A \u2264 \u03c6(U) then U\/\u03c6(U) is nilpotent, whence U is nilpotent, by\nTheorem 6.1 of [8] and the result is clear. So suppose that A 6\u2264 \u03c6(U). Then\nU = A +M for some maximal subalgebra M of U . If we choose B to be\nminimal with respect to U = A+B, then A \u2229B \u2264 \u03c6(B), by Lemma 7.1 of\n[8]. Also U\/A \u223c= B\/(A \u2229 B) is nilpotent, which yields that B is nilpotent.\nIf we now choose C to be the biggest nilpotent subalgebra of U such that\nU = A+C, it is easy to see that C is a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L.\n6\nLemma 4.2 Let L be a Lie algebra, over any field F , in which every max-\nimal subalgebra of each maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L is a c-ideal of L,\nand let A be a minimal abelian ideal of L. Then every maximal subalgebra\nof each maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L\/A is a c-ideal of L\/A.\nProof. Suppose that U\/A is a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L\/A. Then\nU = C + A where C is a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L by Lemma\n4.1. Let B\/A be a maximal subalgebra of U\/A. Then B = B \u2229 (C + A) =\nB\u2229C+A = D+A where D is a maximal subalgebra of C with B\u2229C \u2264 D.\nNow D is a c-ideal of L so there is an ideal K of L with L = D +K and\nD \u2229K \u2264 DL.\nIf A \u2264 K we have L\/A = (D + K)\/A = ((D + A)\/A) + (K\/A) =\n(B\/A) + (K\/A), and (B\/A) \u2229 (K\/A) = (B \u2229K)\/A = ((D + A) \u2229K)\/A =\n(D \u2229K +A)\/A \u2264 (DL +A)\/A \u2264 (B\/A)L\/A.\nIf A 6\u2264 K, we have A \u2229K = 0. Then (A +K)\/K is a minimal ideal of\nL\/K, which is nilpotent, so dimA = 1 and LA \u2264 A \u2229 K = 0. It follows\nthat A \u2264 C and B = D. We have L = B + K and B \u2229 K \u2264 BL, so\nL\/A = (B\/A)+((K+A)\/A) and (B\/A)\u2229((K+A)\/A) = (B\u2229(K+A))\/A =\n(B \u2229K +A)\/A \u2264 (BL +A)\/A \u2264 (B\/A)L\/A.\nLemma 4.3 Let L be a Lie algebra, over any field F , in which every max-\nimal subalgebra of each maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L is a c-ideal of L,\nand suppose that A is a minimal abelian ideal of L and M is a core-free\nmaximal subalgebra of L. Then A is one dimensional.\nProof. We have that L = A \u2295M and A is the unique minimal ideal of L,\nby Lemma 1.4 of [9]. Let C be a maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L with\nA \u2264 C. If C = A, choose B to be a maximal subalgebra of A, so that\nA = B + Fa and BL = 0. Then B is a c-ideal of L so there is an ideal K of\nL with L = B +K and B \u2229K \u2264 BL = 0. But now L = A+K = K, giving\nB = 0 and dimA = 1.\nSo suppose that C 6= A. Then C = A +M \u2229 C. Let B be a maximal\nsubalgebra of C containing M \u2229 C. Then B is a c-ideal of L, so there is an\nideal K of L with L = B +K and B \u2229K \u2264 BL. If A \u2264 BL \u2264 B we have\nC = A+M \u2229C \u2264 B, a contradiction. Hence BL = 0 and L = B \u2295K. Now\nC = B +C \u2229K and B \u2229C \u2229K = B \u2229K = 0. As C is nilpotent this means\nthat dim(C \u2229K) = 1. But A \u2264 C \u2229K, so dimA = 1, as required.\nWe can now prove our main result.\n7\nTheorem 4.4 Let L be a solvable Lie algebra, over any field F , in which\nevery maximal subalgebra of each maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L is a\nc-ideal of L. Then L is supersolvable.\nProof. Let L be a minimal counter-example and let A be a minimal abelian\nideal of L. Then L\/A satisfies the same hypotheses, by Lemma 4.2. We thus\nhave that L\/A is supersolvable, and it remains to show that dimA = 1.\nIf there is another minimal ideal I of L, then A \u223c= (A+I)\/I \u2264 L\/I, which\nis supersolvable and so dimA = 1. So we can assume that A is the unique\nminimal ideal of L. Also, if A \u2264 \u03c6(L) we have that L\/\u03c6(L) is supersolvable,\nwhence L is supersolvable, by Theorem 7 of [2]. We therefore further assume\nthat A 6\u2264 \u03c6(L). It follows that L = A\u2295M , where M is a core-free maximal\nsubalgebra of L.The result now follows from Lemma 4.3.\nIf L has no one-dimensional maximal nilpotent subalgebras, we can re-\nmove the solvability assumption from the above result.\nCorollary 4.5 Let L be a Lie algebra, over any field F , in which every\nmaximal nilpotent subalgebra has dimension at least two. If every maximal\nsubalgebra of each maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L is a c-ideal of L, then\nL is supersolvable.\nProof. Let N be the nilradical of L and let x \/\u2208 N . Then x \u2208 C for some\nmaximal nilpotent subalgebra C of L. Since dimC > 1, there is a maximal\nsubalgebra B of C with x \u2208 B. Now there is an ideal K of L with L = B+K\nand B\u2229K \u2264 BL \u2264 CL \u2264 N . Clearly x \/\u2208 K, since otherwise x \u2208 B\u2229K \u2264 N .\nMoreover, L\/K is nilpotent. We have shown that if x \/\u2208 N there is an ideal\nK of L with x \/\u2208 K and L\/K nilpotent. Proceeding as in Theorem 3.4 we\nsee that L is solvable. The result then follows from Theorem 4.4.\nIf L has a one-dimensional maximal nilpotent subalgebra then we can\nalso remove the solvability assumption from Theorem 4.4 provided that the\nunderlying field F has characteristic zero and L is not three-dimensional\nsimple.\nCorollary 4.6 Let L be a Lie algebra over a field F of characteristic zero.\nIf every maximal subalgebra of each maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L is a\nc-ideal of L, then L is supersolvable or three-dimensional simple.\n8\nProof. If every maximal nilpotent subalgebra of L has dimension at least\ntwo then L is supersolvable, by Corollary 4.5. So we need only consider the\ncase where L has a one-dimensional maximal nilpotent subalgebra, Fx say.\nSuppose first that L is semisimple, so L = S1 \u2295 . . . \u2295 Sn, where Si is a\nsimple ideal of L for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Let n > 1. If x \u2208 Si then choosing s \u2208 Sj\nwith j 6= i we have that Fx + Fs is a two-dimensional abelian subalgebra,\nwhich contradicts the maximality of Fx. If x \/\u2208 Si for every 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, then\nx has non-zero projections in at least two of the Sk\u2019s, say si \u2208 Si and sj \u2208 Sj .\nBut then Fx+Fsi is a two-dimensional abelian subalgebra, a contradiction\nagain. It follows that L is simple. But then Fx is a Cartan subalgebra of\nL, which yields that L has rank one and thus is three dimensional.\nSo now let L be a minimal counter-example. We have seen that L is\nnot semisimple, so it has a minimal abelian ideal A. By Lemma 4.2, L\/A is\nsupersolvable or three-dimensional simple. In the former case, L is solvable\nand so supersolvable, by Theorem 4.4. In the latter case, L = A\u2295 S where\nS is three-dimensional simple, and so a core-free maximal subalgebra of L.\nIt follows from Lemma 4.3 that dimA = 1. But now CL(A) = A or L. In\nthe former case S \u223c= L\/A = L\/CL(A) \u223c= Inn(A), a subalgebra of Der(A),\nwhich is impossible. Hence L = A\u2295S, where A and S are both ideals of L,\nand again L has no one-dimensional maximal nilpotent subalgebras.\n5 One-dimensional c-ideals\nFirst we note that one-dimensional c-ideals are easy to classify.\nProposition 5.1 Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F . Then the one-\ndimensional subalgebra Fx of L is a c-ideal of L if and only if\n(i) Fx is an ideal of L; or\n(ii) x \/\u2208 L2.\nProof. Let Fx be a c-ideal of L. Then there is an ideal K of L such that\nL = Fx +K and Fx \u2229K \u2264 (Fx)L. But Fx \u2229K = Fx or 0. The former\nimplies that Fx is an ideal of L, and the latter implies that x \/\u2208 L2 \u2264 K.\nConversely, suppose that x \/\u2208 L2. Then there is a subspace K of L of\ncodimension one in L such that L2 \u2264 K and x \/\u2208 K. Clearly L = Fx \u2295K\nand K is an ideal of L, whence Fx is a c-ideal of L.\n9\nWe shall denote by Z(L) the centre of L; that is Z(L) = {x \u2208 L : [x, y] =\n0 for all y \u2208 L}. The abelian socle of L, AsocL, is the sum of the minimal\nabelian ideals of L. We say that L is almost abelian if L = L2 \u2295 Fx, where\nL2 is abelian and [x, y] = y for all y \u2208 L2.\nTheorem 5.2 Let L be a Lie algebra over any field F . Then all one-\ndimensional subalgebras of L are c-ideals of L if and only if\n(i) L3 = 0; or\n(ii) L = A\u2295B, where A is an abelian ideal of L and B is an almost abelian\nideal of L.\nProof. Suppose that all one-dimensional subalgebras of L are c-ideals of L.\nFirst note that the one-dimensional ideals are inside AsocL. If Fx is not\nan ideal of L then there is an ideal M of L such that L = Fx +M and\nFx \u2229M \u2264 (Fx)L = 0, so Fx is complemented by an ideal of codimension\none in L.\nNow let A be a minimal ideal of L and let a \u2208 A. If A 6= Fa then there\nis an ideal M of codimension one in L which complements Fa. But this\nimplies that M \u2229A = 0, whence A = Fa, a contradiction. It follows that all\nminimal ideals are one dimensional. Put AsocL = Fa1\u2295 . . .\u2295Far. Suppose\nthat [x, ai] = \u03bbai, [x, aj ] = \u00b5aj and \u03bb 6= \u00b5. Then F (ai + aj) is not an ideal\nof L, and so there is an ideal M of L with L = F (ai+ aj)\u2295M . Clearly one\nof ai, aj does not belong to M : suppose ai \/\u2208 M . Then L = Fai \u2295M and\nai \u2208 Z(L). Hence AsocL = Z \u2295D, where Z = Z(L) and [x, a] = \u03bbxa for all\na \u2208 D and \u03bbx 6= 0.\nLet \u039b : L \u2192 F be given by \u039b(x) = \u03bbx. This is a one-dimensional\nrepresentation of L. Hence, either Im \u039b = 0, in which case D = 0, or else\nL = Ker \u039b\u2295 Fx and \u03bbx = 1. Put L = Z \u2295D\u2295C \u2295 Fx, where C \u2286 Ker \u039b.\nIf y \/\u2208 AsocL then Fy is complemented by an ideal M and L2 \u2264 M , so\ny \/\u2208 L2. This yields that L2 \u2264 AsocL. Clearly D \u2264 L2. If L2 \u2264 Z then\nL3 = 0 and we have case (i). So suppose that D 6= 0 and let a \u2208 D. If\nthere is an element z \u2208 Z \u2229 L2, then F (z + a) is not an ideal of L and so\nz + a \/\u2208 L2, a contradiction. Hence L2 = D.\nLet c \u2208 C. If [x, c] = 0 then Fc is an ideal of L and c \u2208 C \u2229AsocL = 0.\nSo suppose [x, c] 6= 0. Then [x, c] \u2208 D so [x, c \u2212 [x, c]] = 0. This implies\nthat F (c \u2212 [x, c]) is an ideal of L, whence c \u2212 [x, c] \u2208 AsocL. But now\nc \u2208 C \u2229AsocL = 0. Hence C = 0 and L is as described in (ii).\n10\nNow suppose that L3 = 0. If x \u2208 L2 then Fx is an ideal of L. If x \/\u2208 L2\nthere is a subspace M of codimension one in L containing L2 such that\nx \/\u2208M . This implies that Fx is a c-ideal of L.\nFinally suppose that L is as in (ii): say L = Z\u2295A\u2295Fx where Z = Z(L),\nA is abelian and [x, a] = a for all a \u2208 A. Let z + a+ \u03b1x \u2208 L. If z 6= 0 then\nchoosing M = Z1 \u2295 A\u2295 Fx where Z = Z1 \u2295 Fz shows that F (z + a+ \u03b1x)\nis a c-ideal of L. So suppose z = 0. If \u03b1 = 0 then Fa is an ideal of L. If\n\u03b1 6= 0 then choosing M = Z \u2295A shows that F (a+ \u03b1x) is a c-ideal of L.\nReferences\n[1] Barnes, D. W.: Nilpotency of Lie algebras. Math. Z. 79, 237\u2013238 (1962).\n[2] Barnes, D.
