See (Bell 1978) 7 In parallel Weberians such as Ritzer (Ritzer 1993) have pointed to the nature of the organisation of work and the subtle shifts of control from simple top-down hierarchies to \u2018self-management\u2019. Somewhere in between is the re-designation of almost every employee occupation as a \u2018manager\u2019 of some sort. 8 Of course this is a hugely problematic notion. The reports authors, in part, sought to use the report to argue for more legitimacy for cultural activities in the curricular (as opposed to a narrow 3 r\u2019s). 9 This is particularly tricky as policy normally is the responsibility of government departments: activities that stray across boundaries are not well served. Culture is a prime example spanning the Departments of Culture, Industry, and Regeneration.","cites":null},{"id":17258136,"title":"Eds.,2004 The Blackwell Cultural","authors":[],"date":"2005","doi":"10.1002\/9780470774274","raw":"Amin A, Thrift N, Eds.,2004 The Blackwell Cultural Economy Reader.
