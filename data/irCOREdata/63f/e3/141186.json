Introduction\nIn 2008, the Wet Chemistry Laboratory on NASA\u2019s Phoenixlander detected 0.4\u20130.6wt % perchlorate salts (ClO\u00024 ) in\nregolith samples collected from the martian surface and im-\nmediate subsurface at high latitudes (Hecht et al., 2009; Kou-\nnaves et al., 2010). This discovery has led to discussion of the\nimplications for life on Mars (Kerr, 2010; Stoker et al., 2010),\nincluding the speculation that extant martian life might utilize\na water-perchlorate mixture to overcome the subzero condi-\ntions on Mars today, based upon an earlier suggestion of the\nuse of hydrogen peroxide water mixtures (Houtkooper and\nSchulze-Makuch, 2007). The discovery of perchlorates has\nalso led to re-evaluation of the results from the Viking biology\nexperiments of the 1970s (Navarro-Gonza\u00b4lez et al., 2010) and\nhas offered an explanation for the failure of past analyses to\ndetect any organic molecules (biologically produced or oth-\nerwise) on Mars despite their continuing delivery to the sur-\nface in meteoritic material (ten Kate, 2010) independently of\nany past or present-day biology on the planet.\nA number of different geologies and geochemical reservoirs\nare present on Mars that may contain iron-, magnesium-,\ncalcium-, potassium-, and sodium-based perchlorates, de-\npending on the geological and hence geochemical history and\nconditions at a given location. Two types of perchlorates have\nbeen investigated here, namely, calcium and magnesium, for\nreasons described in the Experiment Design section of this\npaper.\nPerchlorate salts are oxidizing, but metastable, unless ini-\ntiated by mechanical action, heating, or electric shock (Shriver\n1Cranfield Health, Cranfield University, Cranfield, United Kingdom.\n2Space Research Centre, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.\nASTROBIOLOGY\nVolume 11, Number 9, 2011\n\u00aa Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\nDOI: 10.1089\/ast.2011.0662\n839\nand Atkins, 1999); therefore, they are not expected to destroy\norganic molecules under martian conditions. Navarro-\nGonza\u00b4lez et al. (2010), however, demonstrated that when\norganic carbon containing Mars-like soils from the Atacama\nDesert is mixed with 1wt % magnesium perchlorate and\nheated, the organics present are decomposed. All previous\nattempts to detect organic molecules on Mars, for example by\nthe gas chromatograph\u2013mass spectrometer (GC-MS) instru-\nment on the Viking landers and Phoenix\u2019s Thermal and\nEvolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA), have relied on pyrolysis to\nvolatize organics present in collected samples. In the Viking\nexperiments, samples were heated to 200\u0002C, 350\u0002C, and 500\u0002C\n(Anderson et al., 1972), and TEGA progressively heated\nsamples up to a temperature of 1000\u0002C (Hoffman et al., 2008).\nHeating to these temperatures in the presence of perchlorates\nmay have destroyed the very molecules that the Viking\nGC-MS and TEGA were trying to detect.\nThe proposed ExoMars Rover (Vago and Kminek, 2007) is\nequipped with a drill capable of collecting rock cores from a\nmaximum depth of 2m and will carry a payload that cur-\nrently includes two instruments capable of detecting trace\nlevels of organic molecules: Mars Organic Molecule Analyser\n(MOMA) and the Life Marker Chip (LMC). Additionally, a\nRaman spectrometer instrument included in the payload will\nbe capable of organics detection if organics are present at\nsuitable levels.\nMars Organic Molecule Analyser is a compact, low-power\nion trap mass spectrometer with the capability to extract\norganics from martian rock and regolith samples by two\ndifferent methods: pyrolysis and laser desorption (Evans-\nNguyen et al., 2008). Extraction by pyrolysis will involve\nevaporation of volatile organics in the martian sample by\nheating to high temperatures followed by injection into a GC\ncolumn with an electron ionization source. Exposure of the\nmartian sample to high temperatures could result in per-\nchlorate-mediated degradation, although recently it has been\nproposed to integrate the use of derivitization reagents to\nincrease the volatility of some organics in order to reduce the\nrequired temperature (Eigenbrode et al., 2011). In extraction\nby laser desorption, the regolith sample will be pulsed with a\nhigh-power UV laser to liberate ions (ESA, 2011); it is un-\nknown whether this technique will be affected by the pres-\nence of perchlorates.\nThe aim is for the LMC, which is under development by a\nUK-led consortium, to analyze martian samples for a pre-\ndefined set of up to 25 organic molecules by using a multi-\nplexed microarray inhibition format immunoassay. The\ncurrent instrument is a variation of the original concept\npublished earlier (Sims et al., 2005) and uses fluorescence\ndetection, while the earlier version used refractive index\nchanges during binding. Target molecules for the LMC in-\nclude biologically produced markers of extant Earth-like life,\nthe digenesis products of these molecules as markers of ex-\ntinct life, and abiotically produced organic molecules such as\npolyaromatic hydrocarbons that result from meteoritic infall\n(Parnell et al., 2007).\nBriefly, the current design of the LMC consists of four\n\u2018\u2018single use\u2019\u2019 modules that can each extract and analyze a\nsingle, approximately 1 g sample of martian regolith or cru-\nshed rock. On Mars, the drill and associated sample proces-\nsing and distribution system on the ExoMars Rover will\ndeliver a 1 g sample of regolith or crushed rock to one module\nof the LMC. The sample will be subject to liquid extraction\nwith use of an aqueous\/miscible organic solvent\/surfactant\nmixture (Court et al., 2010) together with the application of\nultrasonic energy to extract and solubilize polar and apolar\norganic molecules. The extraction solvent has been developed\nas a compromise between efficient extraction of target organic\nmolecules and immunoassay performance. The liquid extract\nwill then be pumped into the analysis system of the LMC,\nwhich consists of microfluidic channels that allow the im-\nplementation of a multiplexed inhibition immunoassay in a\nformat similar to a lateral flow immunoassay (Posthuma-\nTrumpie et al., 2009). The key aspects of the immunoassay\nwithin the microfluidic channel are two chambers: one\nchamber contains a \u2018\u2018freeze-dried cocktail\u2019\u2019 of immunoassay\nreagents that include fluorescently labeled antibodies that\ndissolve into the liquid extract, and a second chamber contains\nan immobilized microarray of protein conjugates of the target\nmolecules. Final readout of the immunoassay signal is\nachieved via imaging of the presence of the fluorescent labels\non the microarray with a CCD-based light-detection system.\nTherefore, if target molecules are present in the extract from\nthe martian sample, they will bind to their corresponding\nfluorescently labeled antibodies, as these dissolve into the\nliquid extract, and will subsequently inhibit the binding of the\nfluorescently labeled antibodies to the corresponding spots of\nprotein conjugates of the target molecules within the micro-\narray. The end result is a fluorescent signal that decreases with\nincreasing target molecule concentration.\nThe LMC\u2019s use of a low-temperature (> 0\u0002C, << + 100\u0002C,\nnominally + 20\u0002C) liquid extraction may offer an advantage\nover other instruments because perchlorate salts are not ex-\npected to act as oxidants under these conditions. However,\nperchlorates are highly water soluble and therefore expected\nto dissolve in the LMC extraction solvent and be carried\nthrough into the LMC analysis system where the perchlo-\nrates could interact with immunoassay reagents via changes\nin parameters such as pH and ionic strength. Within the\nimmunoassay literature, there appear to be no examples that\ndemonstrate detection of small organic molecules by im-\nmunoassay in the presence of perchlorate salts, although\nthere is one recently published study that describes no sig-\nnificant effect of 50mM perchlorate on the antibody-antigen\nreaction by sandwich-type antibody microarray fluorescent\nimmunoassays (Parro et al., 2011). Therefore a study is re-\nquired to establish (a) whether inhibition immunoassays can\nfunction effectively in the presence of a Mars-relevant con-\ncentration of perchlorate and (b) whether inhibition immu-\nnoassays can function effectively in an extract from a sample\nspiked with a Mars-relevant concentration of perchlorate.\nThe study reported here addresses these points in the im-\nmediate context of the LMC and is designed primarily as a\n\u2018\u2018de-risking\u2019\u2019 study to identify major problems that would\nimpact upon the LMC development schedule. This is a\ntimely study given the current development schedule of the\nLMC and more broadly the ExoMars mission.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Chemicals and biochemicals\nAll reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole,\nUK) unless otherwise stated. 4-(Benzo[a]pyren-6-yl)butanoic\nacid was procured from Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemicals\n840 RIX ET AL.\nDivision (Poole, UK) as a custom synthesis and conjugated to\nbovine serum albumin (BSA) with standard EDC\/NHS\ncoupling chemistry. Mouse anti-benzo[a]pyrene clone 22F12\nwas supplied by Prof. Dr. D. Knopp, (Technical University\nof Munich, Germany). Goat anti-mouse IgG Fc biotin\nwas purchased from QED Biosciences (San Diego, USA),\nand streptavidin\u2013horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was purchased\nfrom Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). Methanol was purchased from\nFisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK) andwas HPLC grade. All\nwater usedwas 18O$cm andwas purifiedwith aDirect QUV-3\nwater purification system (Millipore, Massachusetts, USA).\nCalcium perchlorate tetrahydrate (product code 401420) and\nmagnesium perchlorate hexahydrate (product code 309303)\nwere purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n2.2. Spiking of martian regolith simulant with pyrene\nand perchlorates\nThe martian regolith simulant JSC Mars-1 (used as sup-\nplied) was spiked with pyrene in methanol to a final con-\ncentration of 500 lg pyrene\/g simulant regolith. This level\nwas chosen in the combined context of the expected extrac-\ntion efficiency, the known sensitivity of the model immu-\nnoassay used, and an additional factor to produce extracts\nthat gave 100% immunoassay inhibition in the control sam-\nples. It is noted that this results in a higher level of pyrene\nthan could be expected on Mars. To achieve this, 500 lL of\n1mg\/mL pyrene in methanol was added to 1 g of JSC Mars-1\nin a 7mL glass tube, mixed by vortexing, and allowed to\nstand at room temperature for approximately 30min. The\nJSC Mars-1, which consisted of a free-flowing granular ma-\ntrix when dry, formed into clumps when wetted with sol-\nvent. After standing, methanol was removed by evaporation;\nvials were loosely sealed and placed in an oven set at a\ntemperature of 37\u0002C overnight. After approximately 18 h, the\nJSC Mars-1 had reverted to a free-flowing granular matrix.\nControl samples were spiked with methanol containing no\npyrene and mixed and dried in the same way as the pyrene-\nspiked samples.\nAfter spiking with pyrene, JSC Mars-1 was spiked with\n1wt % perchlorate anion by addition of solid calcium per-\nchlorate tetrahydrate or magnesium perchlorate hexahydrate\nto the dry simulant regolith. Fifteen and seven-tenths milli-\ngrams of calcium perchlorate or 16.7mg of magnesium per-\nchlorate (both fine crystalline powders, used as supplied)\nwere weighed into 7mL glass vials, and 1 g of dried pyrene-\nspiked JSC Mars-1 was transferred into each vial and mixed\nwell by inversion and by vortex mixer.\n2.3. Extraction of spiked JSC Mars-1\nThree milliliters of 20\/80% (v\/v) methanol\/water with\n1.5 g\/L polysorbate 80 was added to 1 g spiked JSC Mars-1 in\na glass test tube and sonicated for 20min with a Sonotrode\nUltrasonic UP100H probe and UP50H ultrasonic processor\nset at 40% amplitude (Hielscher Ultrasonics, Teltow, Ger-\nmany), during which time the temperature of the solution\nincreased to above ambient temperature but less than 50\u0002C.\nThis extraction protocol simulates the baseline extraction\nprotocol for the LMC. After ultrasonication, the mixture was\nallowed to stand for 10min, and the cloudy supernatant that\nhad formed above the sedimented JSC Mars-1 was decanted\ninto 1.5mL centrifuge tubes. To minimize loss of extracted\npyrene by absorption to surfaces of the hydrophobic poly-\nmer centrifuge tubes, the tubes were first blocked with 0.5%\n(w\/v) BSA in 100mM HEPES pH 7.4 (a method commonly\nused in immunoassays). The supernatants were clarified by\ncentrifugation at 17,000g for 10min and stored at 2\u20138\u0002C in\nglass vials until tested in the immunoassay.\n2.4. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay (ELISA) procedure\nImmunoassay function was assessed in an inhibition ELISA\nimplemented in a microwell plate format designed to mimic\nthe baseline LMC flight immunoassay format. MicroWell\nplates (Nunc MaxiSorp flat-bottom 96 well; Roskilde, Den-\nmark) were coated with benzo[a]pyrene-BSA conjugate at a\nconcentration of 1 lg\/mL in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6,\n100 lL\/well) and covered with adhesive plate-sealing film\n(Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) to prevent evaporation.\nAfter 1h incubation at a temperature of 37\u0002C, plates were\nwashed with PBS-Tween [0.01 M phosphate buffer, 0.0027 M\npotassium chloride and 0.137 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4\nwith 0.05% (w\/v) Tween 20] and rinsed with water using an\nautomatic plate washer (BW50 plate washer, Biohit, Helsinki,\nFinland). Uncoated binding sites on the plate surface were\nblocked with blocking buffer [0.5% (w\/v) Cohn fraction\nV BSA in 100mM HEPES pH 7.4, 200 lL\/well] for 1 h at\n37\u0002C. Plates were then washed as before.\nTo construct a standard curve, pyrene antigen was dis-\nsolved in LMC solvent [20\/80% (v\/v) methanol\/water with\n1.5 g\/L polysorbate 80] at a concentration of 12,500 ng\/mL\nand diluted with LMC solvent to obtain standard solutions\nin the concentration range 12,500\u20136.1 ng\/mL. Where stan-\ndard curves were run in the presence of perchlorate salts,\ncalcium perchlorate tetrahydrate or magnesium perchlorate\nhexahydrate were dissolved directly in the LMC solvent\nused to dilute pyrene for the standard curve at a concen-\ntration of 16.7mM. This is equivalent to the expected per-\nchlorate concentration if a 1 g sample of regolith containing\n1wt % perchlorate anion is extracted with 3mL of LMC\nsolvent assuming 100% extraction efficiency of perchlorate.\nIn the LMC flight format immunoassay, the liquid extract\nfrom the martian sample is pumped via microfluidic chan-\nnels into a chamber containing a freeze-dried cocktail of\nimmunoassay reagents including the antibodies. The solu-\ntion is incubated in this chamber for approximately 1 h be-\nfore it is transferred into a chamber containing an\nimmobilized microarray of protein conjugates of target\nmolecules. To mimic this in the microwell plate, immuno-\nassay reagents were diluted at 2\u00b7 the final desired concen-\ntration: mouse anti-benzo[a]pyrene clone 22F12 (0.5 lg\/mL),\ngoat anti-mouse IgG Fc biotin (0.2 lg\/mL), and streptavidin-\nHRP (0.15 lg\/mL) (figures in parenthesis are 2\u00b7 the final\ndesired concentration) in LMC solvent [20\/80% (v\/v) meth-\nanol\/water with 1.5 g\/L polysorbate 80], along with the other\nimmunoassay reagents in the freeze-dried cocktail also at\n2\u00b7 the final required concentration [2\u00b7 final concentration=\n20% (w\/v) sucrose, 100 lg\/mL Allura Red AC dye\u2014as a\nvisible dye tracer, 1mg\/mL Cohn fraction V BSA, 0.02% (w\/\nv) thimerosal, 200mM HEPES pH 7.4] and then added 1:1\nwith the extracted sample or standard under test.\nAntibodies and other freeze-dried cocktail reagents were\nincubated together with the sample\/standard under test for\nEFFECT OF PERCHLORATES ON IMMUNOASSAYS 841\n1 h at room temperature before transfer to the coated and\nblocked microwell plate (100 lL\/well), where a further 1 h\nincubation took place. Plates were then washed as described\npreviously. The baseline LMC flight immunoassay format\nwill have a fluorescent readout, but for the purposes of the\nmicrowell immunoassay enzyme (HRP), labeled antibodies\nwere used to generate a colorimetric signal through reaction\nwith a substrate. Substrate solution was prepared by dis-\nsolving 1mg 3,3\u00a2,5,5\u00a2-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride\nin 0.05 M phosphate citrate buffer containing 0.03% sodium\nperborate pH 5.0. Substrate solution was added (100 lL\/\nwell), and color development was allowed to occur for ap-\nproximately 10min. The enzyme reaction was stopped with\n1 M sulfuric acid (50 lL\/well), and the absorbance was read\nat a wavelength of 450 nm with a microwell plate spec-\ntrometer (Varioskan Flash, Thermo Scientific, Leicestershire,\nUK). Immunoassay IC50 (concentration of pyrene that pro-\nduced a 50% drop in immunoassay signal intensity) was\ncalculated by fitting data to a four-parameter binding equa-\ntion (Findlay and Dillard, 2007).\n3. Experimental and Results\n3.1. Experiment design\nPyrene was selected as an LMC-relevant model target for\nthis study since pyrene is an abiotically produced organic\nmolecule, which has previously been detected in meteorites\n(Sephton and Botta, 2005) and may have been delivered to\nthe martian surface by meteoritic infall. More importantly, an\nantibody that recognizes pyrene was readily available at the\ntime of this work and has previously been demonstrated in\nLMC-relevant immunoassay formats. The monoclonal anti-\nbody clone 22F12 used in the pyrene immunoassay was\noriginally raised against benzo[a]pyrene but had also been\nshown to cross react with pyrene and a range of other\npolyaromatic hydrocarbons (Matschulat et al., 2005). While\nthe sensitivity of this immunoassay is appropriate for the\ncurrent study, more sensitive immunoassays are in devel-\nopment for use in the flight instrument.\nA martian regolith simulant developed by the Johnson\nSpace Center (Houston, USA) (Allen et al., 1997), JSC Mars-1\nwas selected for use in this study because it is commonly\nused in studies where a Mars analogue is required (Court\net al., 2010; Gough et al., 2010; Kral et al., 2011).\nPerchlorate salts were spiked into JSC Mars-1 at 1wt %\nperchlorate anion, as this concentration is of the same order\nof magnitude as the levels detected by the Phoenix lander.\nHydrated calcium and magnesium salts were selected for use\nin this study because Hecht et al. (2009) concluded that\nthe perchlorates detected by Phoenix were most likely to be\ncalcium or magnesium salts, and given the evidence that\nwater was present at the Phoenix landing site (Stoker et al.,\n2010), we felt it was reasonable to assume that the perchlo-\nrate salts are in hydrated form.\n3.2. Inhibition immunoassays with pyrene standards\nspiked with perchlorates\nTo confirm that Mars-relevant concentrations of perchlo-\nrate salts in solution do not adversely interact with immu-\nnoassay reagents, inhibition immunoassays were performed\nwith pyrene standards prepared in LMC solvent spiked with\nperchlorate salts. The standard curves generated (Fig. 1)\nconfirmed that the immunoassay functioned in the presence\nof Mars-relevant levels of both calcium and magnesium\nperchlorate; as the concentration of pyrene in the standard\nwas increased, inhibition of assay signal also increased.\nHowever, there were subtle differences between certain\nsamples. Specifically the magnesium perchlorate\u2013spiked\nstandards showed a consistent reduction in assay signal for all\npyrene concentrations compared to the calcium perchlorate\u2013\nspiked standards and to the control standard without per-\nchlorate. Calculated IC50 values for the immunoassay were\n330 ng\/mL pyrene for standards with no added perchlorate,\n360 ng\/mL pyrene for standards spiked with 16mM calcium\nperchlorate, and 160 ng\/mL pyrene for standards spikedwith\n16mM magnesium perchlorate, again showing a change for\nthe magnesium perchlorate\u2013containing pyrene standards\ncompared to the other standards.\nTo confirm that no significant pH change occurred in the\nimmunoassay due to the dissolved perchlorate salts, the pH\nof the solution of perchlorate salts dissolved into the LMC\nextraction solvent containing the freeze-dried cocktail of\nimmunoassay reagents and antibodies (which included a fi-\nnal concentration of 100mM HEPES buffer) was measured\nand found to be in the range of pH 7.0\u20137.5.\n3.3. Inhibition immunoassays with extracts from\npyrene- and perchlorate-spiked samples\nTo confirm that the presence of perchlorate salts in a dry\nsample did not affect the overall LMC analysis, including the\nFIG. 1.

Each data point represents a single replicate for im-\nmunoassays run with (\u0003) no perchlorate, ( ) 16.7mM cal-\ncium perchlorate, and (:) 16.7mM magnesium perchlorate.\nPlotted immunoassay curves are the fit to a four-parameter\nbinding equation for immunoassays run with (solid line) no\nperchlorate, (dotted line) 16.7mM calcium perchlorate, and\n(dashed line) 16.7mM magnesium perchlorate. OD, optical\ndensity.\n842 RIX ET AL.\nextraction step, a martian regolith simulant JSC Mars-1 was\nspiked with pyrene and perchlorate and extracted with LMC\nsolvent; the extracts were analyzed by immunoassay. Note\nthat no attempt was made to determine the efficiency of\nperchlorate dissolution into the LMC extraction solvent.\nSamples of JSC Mars-1 were first spiked with 500 lg\/g or\n0 lg\/g pyrene; then dry calcium perchlorate or magnesium\nperchlorate was added to a level of 1wt % of perchlorate\nanion. Control samples containing no perchlorate were also\nprepared and extracted.\nWhile carrying out the extractions, we observed that, after\ncentrifugation, extracts from 500lg\/g and 0 lg\/g pyrene-\nspiked JSC Mars-1 samples with 1wt % calcium or magne-\nsium perchlorate were colorless liquids, whereas extracts from\n500lg\/g and 0 lg\/g pyrene-spiked JSC Mars-1 samples with\nno added perchlorate were yellow in color (Fig. 2). The pH of\neach of the extracts was measured; all extracts had a similar\npH of approximately 7.0. A proportion of each extract was set\naside for analysis by ELISA. Further experimentation on the\nremaining volumes of extracts revealed that addition of\n16mM perchlorate salts or magnesium chloride salts directly\nto the yellow extract resulted in precipitation or aggregation\nof a yellow colloid-like suspension that could be removed by\ncentrifugation to leave a colorless liquid.\nFigure 3 shows the immunoassay curves produced by\nrunning dilutions of extracts from spiked samples in the\nimmunoassay: extracts from six samples comprising combi-\nnations of pyrene spike level (0 or 500 lg\/g) and perchlorate\nspike (no perchlorate or 1wt % calcium perchlorate or 1wt %\nmagnesium perchlorate).\nFor all extracts from samples spiked with perchlorate (both\ncalcium and magnesium), the immunoassay performed as\nexpected in that extracts from pyrene-spiked samples pro-\nduced inhibition of the assay signal (Fig. 3a); for samples\nwithout pyrene, no inhibition of the assay signal occurred\n(Fig. 3b). For all extracts from samples without perchlorate,\nhowever, anomalous behavior was observed. For the extract\nfrom the sample spiked with 500lg\/g pyrene, at low extract\nconcentration, assay signal was inhibited, but at higher extract\nconcentration (> 6%), a significant reduction in the level of\nassay signal inhibition was seen such that at an extract con-\ncentration of 50% no inhibition of assay signal occurred (Fig.\n3a). For the extract from JSC Mars-1 without pyrene spike, at\nlow extract concentration no inhibition of assay signal was\nobserved, but at higher extract concentration (> 6%), a gradual\nreduction in the level of assay signal was seen such that at an\nFIG. 2. Photograph of extracts frompyrene-spiked JSCMars-1\nsamples.

Plotted immunoassay curves are the\nfit to a four-parameter binding equation; or, where such a fit\nwas deemed inappropriate, curves to show trends in the data\nwere drawn by using linear interpolation between the mean\nnormalized OD values. (Solid line) no perchlorate, (dotted\nline) 1wt % calcium perchlorate, and (dashed line) 1wt %\nmagnesium perchlorate.\nEFFECT OF PERCHLORATES ON IMMUNOASSAYS 843\nextract concentration of 50% an inhibition of assay signal of\napproximately 15% occurred (Fig. 3b). The IC50 values were\ncalculated from the immunoassay data for extracts from the\nsamples spiked with both perchlorate and pyrene, as de-\nscribed in the Materials and Methods section, which resulted\nin values of 2.4% extract concentration for the calcium per-\nchlorate\u2013spiked sample and 2.3% extract concentration for the\nmagnesium perchlorate\u2013spiked sample. The immunoassay\ndata for extracts from the sample spiked with pyrene but with\nno perchlorate was not appropriate to fit to a four-parameter\nbinding model. Nevertheless, we estimated the IC50 value by\nusing only values of extract concentration below 6%, which\nresulted in an IC50 value of 1.0% extract concentration.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Inhibition immunoassays with pyrene standards\nspiked with perchlorates\nAssay signal (optical density) in Fig. 1 is inhibited with\npyrene standards in the presence of both 16mM calcium\nperchlorate and 16mM magnesium perchlorate, which\nshows that the pyrene inhibition immunoassay functioned in\nthe presence of Mars-relevant concentrations of perchlorates.\nThis was not unexpected given two considerations, namely,\nthat (a) under low-temperature conditions perchlorate salts\nare expected to be non-oxidizing and (b) the measured pH\nand calculated ionic strength conditions caused by the\npresence of perchlorates in the present study are within the\nnormal range for an immunoassay. For pH, the inclusion of\n100mM buffer salts in the LMC immunoassay allows a de-\ngree of control of perchlorate-induced pH changes, while for\nionic strength, the addition of 16mM level of perchlorate\nsalts only results in a small change in ionic strength.\nAddition of 16mM calcium perchlorate to pyrene stan-\ndards had little impact on immunoassay binding signal or\nIC50 compared to the control immunoassay run with pyrene\nstandards without added perchlorate, whereas addition of\n16mM magnesium perchlorate to the pyrene standards re-\nduced immunoassay signal and increased the sensitivity\nwith IC50 reduced by approximately 50%. The reason for this\ndifference is uncertain, although it is unlikely to be related to\nthe perchlorate anions, since we assume that both the cal-\ncium and magnesium salts will be fully dissociated in solu-\ntion and therefore present at the same concentration in both\nsets of perchlorate-containing pyrene standards. Magnesium\nmay increase the affinity of the antibody for the free antigen\nbut not for the conjugate, which thus diminishes the signal\nand consequently increases the sensitivity of the inhibitory\nassay. This could be studied in further work by assessing the\neffect of other magnesium salts.\nGiven that the aim is for the LMC to perform a threshold\nmeasurement, that is, to determine whether a target molecule\nis present at a concentration above the instrument detection\nlimit rather than to attempt to quantify target molecules,\nchanges of this magnitude are unlikely to have a significant\nimpact on the ability of the LMC to function successfully.\n4.2. Inhibition immunoassays with extracts\nfrom pyrene- and perchlorate-spiked samples\nImmunoassays with extracts from JSC Mars-1 sample\nspiked with 500lg\/g pyrene and 1wt % perchlorate (Fig. 3a)\nall showed decreasing immunoassay signal as extract con-\ncentration was increased, which implies that pyrene was ex-\ntracted from the spiked JSC Mars-1 and detected in the\nimmunoassay. This conclusion is further supported by ex-\namination of the immunoassay curves produced with extracts\nfrom JSC Mars-1 spiked with 0 lg\/g pyrene and 1wt %\nperchlorate (Fig. 3b), where no reduction in immunoassay\nsignal was observed with increasing extract concentration,\nwhich suggests that the reduction in immunoassay signal\nproduced with extracts from 500lg\/g pyrene and 1wt %\nperchlorate-spiked JSC Mars-1 was not caused by either the\nperchlorate salts or by an interfering substance extracted from\nthe JSC Mars-1 simulant regolith. Therefore, these results in-\ndicate that the presence of Mars-relevant levels of perchlorate\nsalts in a well-studied Mars analog sample matrix had no\nsignificant effect on LMC-representative combined sample\nextraction and inhibition immunoassay detection of a repre-\nsentative small organic molecule LMC target (pyrene).\nThe immunoassay curve produced with extract from JSC\nMars-1 spiked with 500lg\/g pyrene but no perchlorate (Fig.\n3a) is significantly, and unexpectedly, different from all the\nother relevant immunoassay curves presented in Fig. 1 and\nFig. 3a. In addition to this, the immunoassay curve produced\nwith the extract from the unspiked sample (no pyrene and no\nperchlorate) (Fig. 3b) showed a gradual reduction in binding\nsignal at high extract concentrations, which was not observed\nwith extracts spiked with perchlorates (no pyrene). The extract\nconcentration over which this reduction in signal was ob-\nserved was the same as the concentration that produced\nanomalous results for pyrene-spiked samples (no perchlo-\nrates) (Fig. 3a). This observation suggests a common under-\nlying effect. We noted that the anomalous behavior correlated\nwith the yellow coloration of the extracts that only occurred\nfrom samples where no perchlorate was added (Fig. 2). We\ntherefore infer that the substance responsible for the yellow\ncolor of the extract, from samples that had no perchlorate,\ncaused the anomalous changes in immunoassay signal in-\ntensity. Since the final immunoassay readout of the HRP en-\nzyme label was carried out after the yellow-colored extract\nwas washed away, any optical absorption due to the yellow\ncoloration can be discounted. Therefore, we conclude that the\nspecies producing the yellow color interacted with the im-\nmunoassay reagents by an as yet unidentified mechanism. To\nbetter understand the absence of the yellow coloration in ex-\ntracts from the perchlorate-containing samples, further in-\nvestigations were carried out, and we observed that when\nperchlorate or chloride salts were directly added to a yellow-\ncolored extract, precipitation of a fine yellow solid occurred.\nThis yellow solid could be removed by centrifugation to give a\ncolorless extract. Therefore, in extracts from JSCMars-1 spiked\nwith 1wt % perchlorate, we suspect that the species produc-\ning the yellow color was precipitated due to the presence of\nthe perchlorate salts and removed during clarification of the\nextracts by centrifugation, which resulted in colorless extracts.\nThe mechanism for this observation is unknown, but it is\nunlikely to be pH related given that the pH of both the yellow\nand colorless extracts were similar to one another. We have\nnot performed studies to date with other Mars-relevant salts\nto confirm whether this observation is perchlorate salt specific\nor a more general effect due to presence of salts.\nIn addition to the anomalous changes in binding signal,\nthe slopes of the curves produced with the three extracts\n844 RIX ET AL.\nfrom pyrene-spiked JSC Mars-1 with and without perchlo-\nrate salts (Fig. 3a) also differs in that the IC50 value for the\nextract from a sample spiked with pyrene but no perchlorate\nwas 50% lower than values for extracts from samples spiked\nwith pyrene and calcium perchlorate or magnesium per-\nchlorate. This observation could be a result of changes in the\nimmunoassay or changes in the extraction, or both, and it is\nnot possible to determine which from this study. One pos-\nsibility is that some pyrene may have been lost from the\nextract during the precipitation of the yellow solid in extracts\nfrom perchlorate-spiked samples but retained in the extracts\nfrom samples with no perchlorate, where no precipitation of\nthe yellow solid occurred.\nThese results highlight that there is a difference between\nperforming LMC extractions and immunoassays with JSC\nMars-1 spiked with and without perchlorate; the addition of\nperchlorate salts prevented a component of the JSC Mars-1\nfrom interfering with the immunoassay but also doubled\nimmunoassay IC50. This observation will be subject to fur-\nther study to clarify any broader implications.\nWhile the main objective of this study was met, that is, to\ndemonstrate that immunoassays can be performed in the\npresence of martian levels of perchlorate, including an LMC-\nrepresentative extraction step, an unexpected sample matrix\neffect was observed in the absence of perchlorate. This\nwarrants further investigation, but JSC Mars-1 is only rep-\nresentative of one class of a diverse range of possible sample\nmatrixes that may be encountered on Mars. Therefore, we do\nnot anticipate that this sample matrix effect will be present in\nall cases.\nFuture work will be carried out in microarray format\nutilizing fluorescent labels to clarify whether the observed\nchanges in immunoassay performance are related to the HRP\nenzyme label or are true changes in antibody affinity. This\nmay result in the effects observed with the yellow-colored\nextracts becoming negligible. The flight instrument will not\nincorporate a centrifugation step; rather, the martian extract\nwill be filtered through a 0.5 lm pore-size filter prior to in-\ntroduction into the microfluidic channel. Thus, it is important\nto understand the implications of the findings of this study in\na more flight-representative format.\nThe LMC instrument will include up to 25 immunoassays;\ntherefore, further work is required to determine whether\nother LMC-relevant immunoassays behave in a similar\nmanner to the pyrene immunoassay in the presence of per-\nchlorate salts. A selection of different sample matrixes rep-\nresentative of the types of sample that may be encountered\non Mars will also be tested to determine whether the sample\nmatrix type is significant. In addition, it should be taken into\naccount that a spiked sample may not effectively mimic a\nreal sample where organic molecules may be incorporated\ndifferently into the matrix; therefore, testing with natural\nsamples spiked with Mars-relevant levels of perchlorate will\nbe carried out. Ideally, we would perform trials with natural\nsamples with naturally occurring perchlorate salts, but to our\nknowledge there are no terrestrial samples available with\nMars-relevant levels of perchlorates.\n5. Conclusion\nAn immunoassay to detect pyrene, an LMC-relevant\ntarget, was implemented in an LMC-representative immu-\nnoassay format and initially tested in the presence of per-\nchlorate salts. No significant change in immunoassay\nfunction was observed in the presence of Mars-relevant\nlevels of perchlorate salts when directly added to an im-\nmunoassay. This immunoassay was then used to confirm\nthat pyrene could be extracted from a spiked martian reg-\nolith simulant with an LMC-relevant low-temperature ex-\ntraction in the presence of perchlorates, and detected by\nimmunoassay. As a result, the immunoassay was shown to\nfunction in the liquid extract and to detect extracted pyrene.\nFor the same model sample matrix in the absence of per-\nchlorate salts, we observed anomalous effects; immunoas-\nsays performed in the extract showed unexpected assay\nsignals that coincided with a yellow coloration of the ex-\ntracts. This unexpected observation is being studied further.\nTherefore, assuming that the immunoassay and simulant\nregolith tested are representative of all immunoassays and\nsample matrixes to be encountered, we conclude that both\nLMC immunoassay detection and the LMC low-temperature\naqueous extraction with ultrasonication are not negatively\ninfluenced by the presence of perchlorate salts in martian\nsamples at levels similar to those detected at the NASA\nPhoenix landing site. These results increase confidence in the\nLMC\u2019s capability to detect small organic molecules on Mars in\nperchlorate-rich samples and extend the work of Parro et al.\nThe testing of further combinations of immunoassay and\nsample matrixes will be performed to validate the assumption\nthat the pyrene immunoassay and JSC Mars-1 material are\nbroadly representative and will include testing within a\nmultiplexed microarray immunoassay format.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been funded by the Science and Technology\nFacilities Council, UK.
