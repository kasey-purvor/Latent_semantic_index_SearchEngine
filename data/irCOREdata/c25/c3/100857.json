It has\nlong been known that, in addition to the Coulomb force,\nthere exist nuclear isospin breaking (NIB) effects [1,2] that\nhave a significant influence on the Coulomb displacement\nenergies (CDE) between the ground states of isobaric\nanalogues [3]. Recent experimental developments have\nmade it possible to extend these studies to excited states,\nwhich demand the identification of spectra in proton-rich\nspecies. Most of the recent data come from the f7=2 region\n(40< A< 56) where excitation energy differences be-\ntween mirrors (MED) and second differences in the T \u0001\n1 triplets (TED) have been studied up to high spin. One of\nthe best examples is the T \u0001 1 A \u0001 50 mirror pair 50Cr and\n50Fe where the level schemes can now be compared up to\nspin and parity J\u0001 \u0001 11\u0002 [4].\nWhile the CDE are large (several MeV) and dominated\nby the Coulomb force, the MED and TED are small (at\nmost some 200 keV) and here NIB effects are as important\nas Coulomb ones. This was established by Zuker et al. [5]\nby assuming that the A \u0001 42 yrast bands were dominantly\nof f27=2 character and by ascribing the differences between\nobserved and Coulomb-calculated spectra to NIB terms.\nThe outcome was a single term parametrization through\nJ \u0001 0 and 2 pairing operators for TED and MED, respec-\ntively, leading to very good results for A \u0001 47, 49, 50, and\n51, based on precise wave functions obtained by shell\nmodel calculations [6]. Further work in A \u0001 53 confirmed\nthe crucial importance of the \u2018\u2018anomalous\u2019\u2019 J \u0001 2 MED\ncontribution [7].\nThe fact that f7=2 dominance plays an important role in\nguessing the NIB terms seems to be at odds with the\nobservation that fn7=2 calculations often yield quite good\nenergetics but poor wave functions, in general quite inade-\nquate to deal with MED and TED subtleties. A good place\nto resolve this paradox is A \u0001 54: in a pure fn7=2 model, the\ntwo-particle spectra in A \u0001 42 should be identical to the\ntwo-hole spectra in A \u0001 54. To within some 150 keV dis-\ncrepancies, they are, but in A \u0001 54 the mixing occurs\nwithin the pf shell, while in A \u0001 42 it is due to sd shell\ndegrees of freedom. Therefore, this is a case of good\nenergetics and significant departures\u2014of different ori-\ngin\u2014from f7=2 dominance. Two interesting things can\nhappen, depending on whether the MED and TED are\nvery much the same in both cases: (a) if they are, we\nPRL 97, 152501 (2006) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending13 OCTOBER 2006\n0031-9007=06=97(15)=152501(5) 152501-1 \u00a9 2006 The American Physical Society\nmay learn in which circumstances departures from f7=2\ndominance do not matter; (b) if they are not, it will mean\nthat something masquerading as NIB is in fact due to\nconfiguration mixing. The spectra of two members of the\nT \u0001 1 triplet in A \u0001 54 are known (odd-odd 54Co and\neven-even 54Fe [8]). This Letter reports the first experi-\nmental observation of the excited states in 54Ni up to J\u0001 \u0001\n6\u0002, which allows to derive MED and TED for A \u0001 54\nnuclei. These results, compared with those of A \u0001 42 [9],\nreveal a remarkable cross-conjugate symmetry between the\ntwo extremes of the f7=2 shell.\nThe present experiment was performed at the Vivitron\nfacility of the IReS-Strasbourg Laboratory. The 54Ni nu-\ncleus was populated using the 24Mg\u000432S; 2n\u000554Ni reaction\nwith a 32S beam at an energy of 75 MeVand a 0:5 mg=cm2\n24Mg (99.92% isotopically enriched) target on an\n8 mg=cm2 90Zr backing. The incident energy was chosen\nto favor the two-particle evaporation channels and well\nbelow the Coulomb barrier for the reaction with the 90Zr\nbacking. The gamma rays emitted in the reaction were\ndetected using the EUROBALL IVarray in a configuration\nconsisting of 26 Clover and 15 Cluster composite\n(Compton suppressed) detectors. The peak efficiency at\n1.3 MeV for this configuration was close to 7%. The\nforward 1\u0001 solid angle was covered by the neutron wall\n[10], consisting of 50 liquid scintillator neutron detectors.\nThe charged particle detector EUCLIDES [11], composed\nof 40 \u0001E-E Si telescopes (130 \u0002m\u0002 1000 \u0002m thick),\ncovering 80% of the 4\u0001 solid angle, was also used in the\nmeasurement. Events were recorded when either one Ge\ndetector and one neutron wall detector were in coincidence\nor at least two Ge detectors were in coincidence.\nUnambiguous identification of \u0003-ray transitions belonging\nto 54Ni has been achieved by comparing the \u0003-ray spectra\nin coincidence with two neutrons only and with two neu-\ntrons and any charged particle. The construction of the\ntwo-neutron gated spectrum is a complex procedure which\ntakes into account the exclusion of neighboring neutron\nwall detectors and the time-of-flight between them, in\norder to avoid hits in two or more detector elements\nproduced by a single neutron [12]. The high energy por-\ntions of the two spectra are compared in Fig. 1(a). The\npeaks at 1227.1 keV and 1391.8 keV, clearly seen in the\nspectrum in coincidence with two neutrons, disappear\nwhen a coincidence with a charged particle is required.\nThe low energy peak at 451.4 keV partially overlaps with\nthe 46V 451.9-keV transition populated in the 16O\u000432S; pn\u0005\nreaction, and therefore, at this energy, a peak remains in\ncoincidence with charged particles. The three new \u0003 rays\nare in coincidence with each other as shown in the analysis\nof a \u0003\u0003 \u0003 matrix with the condition of at least one neutron\ndetected. This can be seen in Fig. 1(b), where a sum of\ngates on the 1227.1-keV and 1391.8-keV transitions is\nshown. Possible contaminants confounding the identifica-\ntion could come from the 0.08% presence of the other Mg\nisotopes in the enriched material, from oxygen due to the\noxidation of the target after preparation and from the\ncarbon deposited on the target surface during the experi-\nment. The two-neutron evaporation channel from the reac-\ntion of the 32S beam with 25;26Mg and 12C are nuclei with\nwell-known structure.

Channels evaporating three or\nmore neutrons, leading to unknown neutron-deficient nu-\nclei, are excluded on the ground of cross-section system-\natics and calculations with the statistical model codes\nCASCADE [14] and HIVAP [15]. We conclude that the three\nlines in Fig. 1(b) must come from the 2n channel of the\nreaction with 24Mg and therefore correspond to the 54Ni\ndeexcitation spectrum. The transitions have been placed in\nthe level scheme, shown in Fig. 2, on the basis of coinci-\ndence relationship and relative intensities. The correspond-\ning levels of 54Co and 54Fe [8] are also shown in Fig. 2. The\nstretched quadrupole character of the three transitions is\nconsistent with the measured anisotropy between the\nClover (\u000690\u0007) and Clusters (centered around \u0006145\u0007)\ndetectors [see Fig. 1(c)]. The three transitions assigned to\n54Ni have, as expected, a close similarity to the first three\ntransitions in the mirror nucleus 54Fe. Preliminary results\nof this work have been reported in Ref. [16]. Our identi-\nfication of the 2\u0002 level at 1392 keV in 54Ni has been\nconfirmed in Coulomb excitation experiments using a ra-\ndioactive 54Ni beam produced by fragmentation of 58Ni\n[17,18].\nIn Fig. 3(a) we compare the experimental MED\u0004J\u0005 \u0001\nE\bJ\u000454Ni\u0005 \u0003 E\bJ\u000454Fe\u0005 with \u0003MED\u0004J\u0005 \u0001 E\bJ\u000442Ca\u0005 \u0003\nE\bJ\u000442Ti\u0005 (signs change upon cross conjugation). The f27=2\nstrength in A \u0001 42 is known to be fragmented. This is of\nlittle consequence except for J \u0001 2 where it splits evenly\nbetween the two lowest states [19]. Hence the correspond-\ning values are given for their average and for the lowest\nstate. For both, the agreement with A \u0001 54 is quite good.\nWhich brings us back to the question: why should f7=2\ncross conjugation work so well in this case? The answer\nwill come by examining the full pf shell model\ncalculation.\nIn Fig. 3(b) the experimental MED for A \u0001 54 are\ncompared with calculations performed as described in\nRef. [5]; i.e., the eigenfunctions are obtained with the\nKB3G [20] residual interaction in the pf shell, with a t \u0001\n8 truncation.

These three terms are those\npresent in Ref. [5]. Cll [3] and Cls [21,22] are single-\nparticle contributions of electromagnetic origin, ignored\nin [5] and added here for consistency. It is apparent from\nFig. 3(b) that the overall pattern is due to the interplay of\nVJCM and VJB\u00041\u0005, while the contribution to MED of VCm, Cll,\nand Cls\u2014which depends on the occupancies of the differ-\nent orbits\u2014is small. It means that the occupancies must be\nvery much independent of J. Configuration mixing may be\nlarge: in our case all the f147=2 components amount to about\n60% of the wave functions, but the other configurations\nhave weights that are almost constant with J. That explains\nwhy a pure f7=2 description works well: the terms that may\nbreak cross conjugation symmetry do exist but they have\nJ-independent effects that vanish for the MED and TED.\nConcerning the parameters: the VB\u00041\u0005 strength is as in\n[5], while the am coefficient affecting VCm has been re-\nduced from 300 to 200 keV following [23]. As for T \u0001 1 it\ndoubles with respect to T \u0001 1=2; it is actually 400 keV.\nTurning now to the experimental triplet energy differ-\nences, TED\u0004J\u0005 \u0001 E\bJ\u000454Ni\u0005 \u0002 E\bJ\u000454Fe\u0005 \u0003 2E\bJ\u000454Co\u0005, we\nare limited by the fact that the J\u0001 \u0001 6\u0002 state in 54Co is\nnot known and we can therefore compare data [see\nFig. 3(c)] up to J\u0001 \u0001 4\u0002 [8]. The corresponding A \u0001 42\nvalues are seen to follow exactly the same pattern within a\nfactor of about 1.35. As a consequence, when the theoreti-\ncal TED values are calculated:\n TED \u0004J\u0005 \u0001 \u0001TEDhVJCM \u0002 VJB\u00042\u0005i; (2)\nthe monopole pairing strength of VJB\u00042\u0005 that fits A \u0001 54 is\n50 keV, half the 100 keV needed for A \u0001 42 and adopted in\n[5]. To try to shed some light on this apparent anomaly we\nrecall that VJB\u00041\u0005 and V\nJ\nB\u00042\u0005 are each represented by a single\nf27=2 matrix element. As it was shown that, for the Coulomb\nforce, the four f27=2 matrix elements reproduce the full pf\nresults within a multiplicative factor, we try to do the same\nwithin the Vlow k formulation, using a modern charge-\ndependent potential that reproduces the nucleon-nucleon\nscattering data up to 350 MeV. Here we have chosen the\nAV18 potential with @! \u0001 10 MeV [24], but similar re-\nsults are obtained for any such potential. The results are\nshown in Table I. It is clear that for the MED the phenom-\nenologically essential J \u0001 2 quadrupole will be missed,\nwhatever the multiplicative factor. For the TED\u2014though\nthe trend is well reproduced\u2014the effect of AV18 amounts\nto trebling the Coulomb force, while we need a bit less than\ndoubling (and a bit more in A \u0001 42, also shown for com-\nparison). We can therefore here conclude that we under-\nstand why cross conjugation works, but we do not\nunderstand why it works better for MED than for TED.\nThe subject deserves further study.\nSummarizing, the \u2018\u2018f7=2\u2019\u2019 region is unique in that it\nmakes possible to analyze high quality MED and TED\ndata with theoretical tools that range from a very simple\nf7=2 model to the most rigorous microscopic calculations\navailable. In particular, it is the only region where NIB\neffects have been detected at a spectroscopic level (i.e.,\nbeyond displacement energies). The A \u0001 54 triplet is in\nturn special in that the simple model works best, where it is\nexpected to do poorly. The study of the MED reveals why\nthis is so, and confirms the existence of an important NIB\nmechanism. Comparison with modern charge-dependent\npotentials reveals that they fail to account for the quadru-\npole pairing responsible for the MED patterns across the\nregion, while reproducing but overshooting the observed\nTED trends.\nThe authors are grateful to the IReS Vivitron accelerator\nstaff and to R.
