Burbidge and A.M. Richardson \nTechniques for a simple automated test approach for high \nperformance fully embedded charge-pump phase-locked loops \n(CP-PLLs) are explained. The test approach is focused towards \nnon-invasive high volume production testing of PLLs using digital \nonly testers in conjunction with additional on-chip circuitry. \nIntroduction: In recent years the charge-pump phase-locked loop \n(CP-PLL) has become a ubiquitous mixed signal (ME) building \nblock. The most common application for the CP-PLL is for on- \nchip clock regeneration. All other on-chip functions will be reliant \non the operation of the PLL, thus it is essential that it is verified \ncorrectly. Unfortunately, problems relating to test time, and test \naccess, can lead to the PLL being insufficiently tested. Often only \na simple frequency lock test (FLT) is carried out on the PLL. \nAlthough the FLT will uncover many hard faults in the PLL, it \ndoes not generally provide sufficient information relating to short- \nterm transient operation (instability and jitter effects). Characteris- \ntics effecting transient operation such as CP mismatch, CP leak- \nage, CP nonlinearity, loop filter (LF) leakage, voltage controlled \noscillator (VCO) nonlinearity and static phase error, are strongly \ndependent on forward path (FP) PLL blocks. In this Letter we \noutline a simple non-invasive measurement technique that can be \nused to monitor FP operation, and thus provide improved infor- \nmation on PLL operation [l]. \n1, \nPLLREF \nfosc =Kvco.\u201dc \nfoSC= N.PLLREF \nPLLFB \nFig. 1 Basic CP-PLL architecture \nPLLFB \nPLLREF \n0 IEE 2001 23 July 2001 1 -\u2018CH 1 I \nElectronics Letters Online No: 20010898 \nD 01: 10.1049\/el:200 I0898 \nE.

This action \ncharges or (discharges) the LF  (Zf), thus V, increases or \n(decreases), and JbSC increases or (decreases). The waveforms for \nPLLREF = PLLFB\/2 (i.e. PLLREF is at half the frequency of \nPLLFB) are shown in Fig. 2. This basic operation can be \nexploited to facilitate testing of the forward path blocks. In nor- \nmal operation, connection of the blocks as shown allows genera- \ntion of an output signal that is phase aligned to the input signal. \nFurther information on CP-PLL operation can be found in [2, 31. \nBasic test outline: huru\u2019wure descrbtioa: The basic concept behind \nthe test is to allow the FP blocks of the PLL to be exercised while \n1318 ELECTRONICS LETTERS 25th October2001 Vol. 37 No. 22 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Input paths of the \nPLL are redirected using an input multiplexer (MUX). Parameter \nextraction is facilitated by direct measurement of the VCO output \nfrequency using an on-chip frequency counter as in [4, 51.

Note that equations in the ramp up \nmode are identical with the exception that the direction of current \nflow from the loop filter is reversed. The procedure used to obtain \nthe relationship between Afosc and AFExTREF will be applicable to \nany Zf() usually incorporated in a CP-PLL. It is important to \nnote that in the final equation ZcH is a function of the CP cir- \ncuitry, and is known by design. AYosc will be related to the VCO \ninput voltage and the Kvco (the gain of the VCO in MHzN or \nradlsN) which will be known by design. N E X T R E F  and fExTnEF can \nbe accurately controlled. \nThus, a measure of the forward path gain of the PLL blocks, \nrelated to a precise time difference at the input, can be obtained. \nFurthermore, it is possible to map the measured frequency value \nto desired responses. \nConclusion: A non-invasive BIST method for CP-PLLs has been \npresented. The test approach is intended to augment the com- \nmonly-used FLT, and targets significant PLL sub-block character- \nistics that have direct impact on the short-term transient operation \nof the PLL. Furthermore, the test can be realised using simple \nhardware and results can be mapped directly to design specifica- \ntions. \nAcknowledgments: This work has been supported by EPSRC con- \ntract GlUM7553 \u2018ATOM\u2019. \n0 IEE 2001 \nElectronics Letters Online No: 20010914 \nDOI: 10.1049\/el:20010914 \nM.J.
