The present work focuses on a scaled down \nversion of a high energy, double entry double volute pump.  Double entry pumps are used in \napplications that would require a high flow in a single stage pump.  However, due to the high \nenergies involved these pumps tend to suffer more from pressure pulsations than single entry \npumps. \n \nA number of investigators have considered the effect of geometry modifications on the pressure \nvariations within pumps, either by monitoring the pressure directly or through changes in the axial \nand\/or radial thrust.  Uchida et al [1] performed tests that involved monitoring the radial force and \npump performance for different volute cutwater gaps and cutwater shapes using a single entry end \nsuction pump.   \n \nIn 1978, Makay and Szamody [2] reported research into the major causes of pump failure (see also \nSpence and Purdom [3]).  They suggested that emphasis on gaining high efficiencies at design \nconditions led to undesirable flow features at part load operation and provided a thorough \nexamination of pumps and pump design relating to performance difficulties.  Makay and Szamody \nhighlighted the importance of internal pump clearances, especially those between rotating and \nstationary parts where high gradients exist.   A later report [4], which covered similar ground \nrecommended that the safe minimum flow for a large feed pump should be 25% of the design flow \ncondition; also that on double-entry impellers the impeller blade should be staggered (or clocked) to \nminimise hydraulic forces and that for double entry impellers the central shroud should be extended \nto the impeller outer diameter.  Unfortunately, these recommendations were not presented with any \nback up information or discussion of the possible performance changes in the pump due to either \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 4 \ndesign modification.  Sudo et al [5] provide some experimental information concerning the \nvariation in pressure pulsations at the pump discharge due to the cutwater gap, skew of the cutwater \ntongue and the clocking of the impeller.  Sudo et al report that the staggered impeller vanes produce \npulsation amplitudes of around a quarter of those present for an inline impeller arrangement, but \ntheir measurements were some distance from the pump discharge. \n \nIt has generally been accepted that while the accuracy of CFD analyses has not yet achieved a level \nthat is equivalent to experimental techniques, its ability to correctly predict the direction of any \nchanges is reliable [6].  Others consider that CFD can be particularly adept in aiding understanding \nof the effect of ranges of parameters [7].  Yet little has been published regarding CFD being used \nfor parametric studies, although work performed at the University of Oviedo has recently compared \ntwo impeller diameters, i.e. Gonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e9rez et al [8] and Blanco et al [9].  Earlier work by Spence \nand Teixeira [10] has shown the feasibility of generating a numerical model of a complete pump \ngeometry and conducting CFD analyses using this model over a flow range from 1.00Qn (BEP) \ndown to 0.25Qn.  That study also compared the pressure pulsations from the numerical analysis at \nlocations within the impeller, volute and leakage flow passages with experimental test data and \nreasonable agreement was found.  The numerical model was also found to correctly predict pressure \npulsation trends for different pump geometries.  Additionally, information relating to some of the \ninternal flow features observed within the pump both at BEP and reduced flow rates has also been \npublished [11].  \n \nThis present paper uses the analysis in [10] to provide a wider parametric study that investigates the \neffect of various geometry features on the pressure pulsations in the pump.  A survey of literature \nand industrial experience provided a shortlist of key parameters in the design process and that are \nlikely to have an effect on the pressure variation in the pump.   These key areas are, the cutwater \nclearance gap [radial distance between impeller blade tip and the volute cutwater], the snubber \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 5 \nclearance gap [radial distance between the shroud outer diameter and the volute casing], sidewall \nclearance [minimum axial distance between the impeller shroud and the volute casing] and blade \nclocking or stagger [on a double entry impeller this is the practice of offsetting the arrangement of \nblades on one side of the impeller so that they do not coincide with the blades on the opposite side].  \nThe parametric study utilises a Taguchi array to reduce the number of analyses required at each \nflow rate, with three flow rates being investigated, namely 1.00Qn, 0.50Qn and 0.25Qn.  The array \nprovides a framework for the post processing of the results and allows the reduction of the pressure \npulsations in conjunction with the adjustment of the above variables.  This is a rationalisation \nprocess that does not solely focus on reducing the pressure pulsation since other critical factors, \nsuch as the pump generated head, are also considered.  Broadly, the objective of this rationalisation \nis to assist the development of pump designs, which will achieve reduced levels of pulsations \nwithout significant loss in performance. \n \n2 Pump Geometry \nThe centrifugal pump simulated is of a double entry, double volute type, shown in Figure 1, with a \nspecific speed of 0.74.  The double entry impeller has a maximum diameter of 366mm, with 6 \nbackwards curved blades per side.  It should be noted that the largest impeller diameter used in the \ninvestigation was deliberately oversized for the pump design.  The impeller blade has average inlet \nand outlet angles of 26 and 22.5 degrees respectively, with the blade wrap angle being 102 degrees.   \nThe cutwater tongue is at a diameter of 380mm, with a radius of 12mm.  The pump operates at a \nspeed of 1400rpm, with a duty flow condition of 550m3\/h.  The duty flow condition used in all \nanalyses relates to the design flow rate for the original pump and so the pump will not be operating \nat its optimal flow condition.  Table 1 provides a list of the main characteristics of the pump. \n \nThe geometrical factors considered for the parametric study are shown in Figure 2 and the values \ngiven in Table 2.  Three cutwater gaps are considered, 3.83%, 6.00% and 7.95%, based on the \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 6 \nactual blade diameter.  The change in cutwater gap was achieved by reducing the impeller blade \ndiameter (corresponding impeller blade diameters are 366mm, 358.5mm and 352mm respectively).  \nThree snubber gap sizes are also considered, namely 0.27%, 1.10% and 1.27%, also based on the \nshroud diameter, along with three sidewall leakage flow clearances that are for convenience termed \n100%, 50% and 25% where 100% corresponds with a 12mm clearance in this case.  Finally three \ndifferent impeller arrangements are considered, an inline or straight arrangement, a mid position \nstagger (30 degree) and a quarter position stagger (15 degree).  Figure 3 shows the different \nimpeller arrangements.  It should be noted that the staggered impeller arrangements contain a \ncentral hub extended to the outer impeller diameter, while the inline impeller terminates the hub at a \nradius part way through the impeller.  Table 2 provides information relating to the various \narrangements analysed. \n \n \n3 Numerical Model \nThe numerical simulation is conducted using CFX-TASCflow, which utilises a finite element based \nfinite volume method to solve the unsteady three-dimensional Navier-Stoker equations on a \nstructured grid.  CFX-TASCflow also has the advantages of including some turbomachinery \nspecific capabilities at the pre- and post- stages of the simulation. \nAs has been noted earlier, a previous paper [10] contains detailed information concerning the \ngeneration of the numerical model.  This previous paper includes descriptions of the grid \nindependence checks conducted, in addition to the examination of different boundary conditions \nand turbulence models with a view to achieving a robust analysis in a reasonable timeframe while \npreserving the accuracy of the analyses.  Information relating to the interpretation of the data gained \nfrom the analyses and comparisons with industrial experimental tests are also provided in this \nprevious work.  A brief summary of this work is contained below. \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 7 \n3.1 Grid Generation \nThe pump is split into a number of component parts for modelling.  The component parts included, \n(a) the double suction inlet, (b) the leakage flow paths comprising the snubber gap, sidewall \nclearance and wear ring gaps, (c) the pump impeller (both sides), (d) the double volute and (e) a mid \nblock between the two sides of the impeller (the mid block is only present for staggered impeller \narrangements).  Due to the size and complexity of the pump care was taken regarding the \ndistribution of grid elements in the model.  A detailed grid independence check was conducted for \nthe impeller grid using single passageway sizes ranging from 10000 to 85000 elements, with the \ninfluence of the volute on the flow in the impeller grid being factored into the check.  This \nconcluded that an impeller grid size of 22000 elements\/nodes per passageway was sufficient to \nreliably model the pressure in the impeller.  The impeller model consisted of 12 passageways and \ntotalled 227126 elements. Care was taken to concentrate grid in the cutwater region of the volute \nand the axial distribution at the impeller interface replicated the impeller grid distribution. In total, \n391848 elements were used to model the volute.  The leakage flow path model was generated in \nsuch a way that multiple snubber and sidewall geometric arrangements could be analysed through \nuse of a single grid and the block-off feature in CFX-TASCflow.  The leakage flow path comprised \n161760 grid elements.  The suction inlet model consisted of 89756 elements.  The model was \nassembled using a step-by-step iterative process that allowed each component grid model to be \nexamined and refined in order to improve the interaction of the flow between components.  This \nwas a time consuming process, but gives confidence in the large, complex numerical model since \neach component was capable of modelling not only its internal flow satisfactorily, but had also been \ngenerated with consideration of interactive effects with other components.  Once complete the total \npump model consisted of 870500 hexahedral elements.  Figure 4 provides an indication of the \noverall model mesh.   \n \n3.2 Pre-Processing \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 8 \nThe pre-processing set up of the pump model was conducted with consideration of the limitations \ninvolved with gaining a stable transient analysis while performing analyses over a wide range of \nflow conditions.  The impeller and leakage flow grid components were set in a rotating frame of \nreference.  The interfaces between rotating and stationary frames were modelled using the \nrotor\/stator interface option; interfaces between components in the same frame of reference use the \ngeneral grid interface (GGI) option.  Although a number of boundary conditions were examined, the \nparametric study was conducted using a mass flow at inlet and static pressure at outlet as this set of \nboundary conditions had been found to be more stable and converge faster than other combinations \nwithout a significant loss in accuracy.  As noted above the duty flow condition for all geometry \nconfigurations was 550 m3\/h.  This decision was made to ensure consistency with experimental \nwork that was conducted with a single duty flow rate.  The flow rates chosen for examination in this \nproject were deliberately selected at significant spacing to preserve general trends with varying flow \nrate. It was calculated that the extremes of geometry would indicate a best efficiency point shift of \nless than 5% in the flow rate.  The internal and external impeller surfaces were modelled using a \nrotating wall, while all other walls were stationary. \n \nTurbulence was modelled with a standard k-epsilon model; wall functions based on the logarithmic \nlaw were used.  A second order discretisation process was employed in the transient analyses.  The \ncalculations were conducted serially on computers that contain two Intel 3GHz processors with \n6GB of shared memory apiece.  The time taken per iteration is dependent on the arrangement and \nflowrate analysed, but is approximately one iteration per hour.  Typically periodic unsteady \nconvergence was achieved in four to five impeller revolutions.  The timestep selected for use in the \ncurrent analyses was 1.488\u00b710-4 seconds, as this provided 288 time steps per impeller rotation (48 \ntime steps per blade passage).  This timestep was chosen based upon the work of Koumoutsos [12] \nwho conducted transient analyses of a centrifugal pump using time steps equivalent to 250 and 500 \ntime steps per revolution and concluded that 250 time steps per revolution (50 time steps per \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 9 \nrevolution) was adequate for a reliable and accurate analysis. Thus the selection of the timestep, \ngiving a greater number of time steps per impeller revolution, was considered to have preserved the \naccuracy and stability of the analysis, with the Courant Freidrich Levy (CFL) number being less \nthan 30.  Transient results files were created after every second iterative loop. \n \n3.3 Pressure Pulsation Monitoring Locations \nThe pressure pulsation level was investigated at fifteen locations around the pump.  Figure 5 \nprovides the circumferential position of a number of the locations in the volute and leakage flow \npassage. \n \nLeakage Flow Locations (in casing wall in leakage flow path at back of impeller) \nC1 \u2013 60mm ahead of the leading edge cutwater (not shown) \nC2 \u2013 30mm ahead of the leading edge cutwater \nC3 \u2013 at the leading edge cutwater \nC4 \u2013 30mm past the leading edge cutwater \nC10 \u2013 60mm ahead of the leading edge cutwater, opposite to C1 (not shown) \n \nVolute Locations (at splitter, 25mm axially offset from pump centreline) \nC5 \u2013 5mm back from the cutwater leading edge \nC6 \u2013 15mm back from the cutwater leading edge \nC7 \u2013 30mm back from the cutwater leading edge \nC8 \u2013 50mm back from the cutwater leading edge \nC9 \u2013 Top, centre of the pump (not shown) \nCd \u2013 Pump discharge (not shown) \n \nImpeller Positions (all not shown) \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 10 \nShroud B (above blade) \u2013 shroud outer diameter, positioned above an impeller blade. \nShroud M (mid passage) \u2013 shroud outer diameter, positioned mid way between two impeller blades. \nBlade P \u2013 located on the pressure face of an impeller blade at the trailing edge. \nBlade S \u2013 located on the suction face of an impeller blade at the trailing edge. \n \nIn order to keep the presentation manageable the results given in this paper are restricted to a single \nmonitoring position in each of the major pump regions, e.g. C4 for leakage flow path, C6 for volute \ncutwater, C9 for general volute\/towards discharge and Blade P for the impeller outlet.  Results at \nsome of the other positions will be mentioned in discussion. \n \n3.4 Summary of Experimental Comparison  \nThe uncertainty in the present analysis has been minimised and assessed through two approaches.   \nFirstly through convergence studies as described in section 3.1 and by comparison with industrial \nbased experiments.  The former have shown that the present mesh size, for the impeller, is within \n3% of a much finer grid.  The latter is described in detail in references [10] & [11] but the results \nare summarised here for convenience. \n \nTable 3 provides a comparison of the CFD simulation (arrangement 2) with experimental data for \nthe 0.25Qn and 1.00Qn flow rates.  The table gives an indication of the percentage variation of the \nCFD simulation with the industrial test results at a selection of locations around the pump (with the \ndifference being divided by the experimental value).  The agreement at the impeller shroud where \nthe pulsation levels are relatively high is excellent and typically the differences are significantly \nlower for all flow rates than the average, being as low as 7%.   It should be pointed out that the C5 \nand C6 positions (which show a higher difference) are very sensitive to the actual monitored \nlocation because of the high pressure pulsation gradients in the vicinity of the cutwater tongue.  The \nshroud and C9 (towards the discharge) positions are important locations for monitoring within the \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 11 \npump as the estimation of fatigue levels in the impeller requires information at the impeller shroud \nand the C9 position can be used to provide a more general indication of pressure pulsations within \nthe pump.   At these locations the variations are better than average and can reach levels as low as \n3%.  Generally within the pump, the differences have an average value across all locations being \nbetween 25%-30%, but it is important to note that all of these comparisons show substantial \nimprovement over previous pulsation work performed by Longatte and Kueny [13] and Talha [14] \nwho respectively reported over prediction of pulsations by 1000% and 300% in comparison with \nexperimental tests.   \n \nIn general the relationship between the numerical simulation and experimental test is rather \ncomplex.  The percentage variation with the experimental values does not appear to show any \nidentifiable improvement at flow rates closer to the BEP flow condition.  However the pulsation \nvariation at 1.00Qn is approximately half that calculated for 0.25Qn for both arrangements when \naveraged across all measured locations.  Unfortunately only limited experimental performance data \nis available for comparison, i.e. no efficiency information was recorded.  However, for the \narrangement shown, the comparison of the available data indicates that the CFD simulation predicts \nthe pump generated head to within 4% of the experiment at the 1.00Qn flow rate, with this \nincreasing to 7% at the lowest flow condition.  \n \n3.5 Presentation and Discussion of Results  \nThe output from the CFD analyses provided a time history of the pressure variation and \nperformance characteristics as the impeller rotated in the volute.  Figure 6 provides sample time \nhistories of the normalised relative pressure at the four selected locations around the pump for the \nfifth geometrical arrangement (shown in Table 2) and at 1.00Qn.  The relation of the pressure \npulsation to the movement of the blade relative to the cutwater can be described using Figure 6a \n(i.e. a location at the cutwater).  The highest pressure, occurring at zero degrees and every 60 \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 12 \ndegrees thereafter, takes place just before the pressure face of the impeller blade reaches the \ncutwater.  As the blade passes the cutwater the effect of the wake impinging on the cutwater causes \na sharp decrease in the pressure, with a minimum being reached as the suction face of the impeller \nblade passes the cutwater.  Then, as the impeller blade continues past the cutwater the pressure rises \nrapidly.  The time period for this pulsation in pressure is short, relating to under half the time for \neach blade pass.  The C4 position (in the leakage flow passageway), Figure 6(b) records a regular \npulsation with the pulsation frequency corresponding to blade rate.  The amplitude of pulsation is \ngenerally half that experienced at the cutwater.  Figure 6(c) illustrates that the pulsations at C9 \n(approaching the outlet) are approximately a quarter of those recorded at the cutwater; the location \ndoes identify the peaks corresponding with the blade passing frequency. The impeller blade \npressure face location time history, Figure 6d, shows two larger peaks corresponding to the blade \npassing the splitter (180 degrees) and the cutwater (zero\/360 degrees) respectively.  It can be \nobserved that although the splitter and cutwater have been designed to be as alike as possible, the \npulsation at the splitter is significantly larger.  There is also significant difference in the pressure \nvariation from the cutwater to splitter (0-180\u00ba) than from the splitter to the cutwater (180-360\u00ba).  \nThe positive pressure gradient in the initial half of the casing is likely due to the use of an oversize \nimpeller in the analyses indicating that the 1.00Qn flow condition is actually lower than the \noptimum design flow rate.  This indicates that slight differences in each half of the volute geometry \nresults in them having different optimised flow conditions.  \n \nIt should be noted that although peak-to-peak pulsations are investigated for each location, the \npurpose of the investigation is to gain an indication of the change (and rate of change) of these \nmaxima with differing geometries rather than identify the location of the highest pressure pulsation \nwithin the pump.  In order to present the parametric results in a concise fashion, the maximum \npeak-to-peak pressure pulsations results for all nine arrangements and the three flow rates have been \nextracted from graphs similar to Figure 6.    These are presented in Tables 4, 5 and 6 respectively.  \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 13 \nIt is clear that the pressure pulsations increase as the flow decreases and that the largest pulsations \nexist at the trailing edge of the impeller blade.  The pulsations at the volute cutwater are larger than \nthose in the leakage region and the cutwater gap and vane arrangement are the geometric \nparameters with the strongest effects.   \n \n4 Taguchi Background \n \nTaguchi\u2019s concept was to design a quality product rather than inspecting a product to determine if it \nwas a quality product.   The Taguchi methodology optimises the configurations used in a parametric \nstudy such that fewer configurations are required to identify the relative importance of the selected \nparameters.  The Taguchi approach sets out configurations (or arrangements) to be conducted using \nan appropriate orthogonal array; the terminology used in these arrays includes \u201cfactors\u201d \u2013 an item \nthat is to be varied during the simulations, \u201clevel\u201d \u2013 the number of times a factor is to be varied \nduring the simulations and \u201cconfiguration number\u201d - the number of simulations that are required to \nbe run to complete the analysis.  Thus the cutwater gap is a \u201cfactor\u201d, which has three levels (i.e. \n3.83%, 6.00% and 7.95%).  In total, the simulations conducted in this work are to investigate four, \nthree level factors (i.e. cutwater gap, snubber gap, sidewall clearance and vane arrangement).     \n \nThe selection of an appropriate Taguchi array is dependent on the number of factors and the levels \nof the factors to be analysed.  The letter L and a subscript number identify the arrays.  Roy [15] \nprovides a table of common orthogonal arrays and their related number of factors and levels, which \nindicates that for the current requirement the L9 array is appropriate.  To produce a full factorial \nparameter study of the geometric variables, the number of cases required would be 243 (4 factors \nwith 3 levels at 3 flow rates).  The Taguchi approach reduces this to 27 cases.  The layout of the L9 \narray with the various factors and levels is shown in Table 2.  It was considered that an L4 array \nwith two factors and two levels could be used to provide additional information for the significant \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 14 \nfactors from the L9 array.  Two L4 arrays have been used and these are shown in Tables 4 and 5, \nconsisting of arrangements previously analysed as part of the larger L9 array.  The particular \narrangements used to form the smaller L4 arrays depend on the results of the L9 array. \n \nPressure pulsations have been used as the quality characteristic, with \u201cthe lower the better\u201d being \nset as the criterion of evaluation.  Other quality characteristics such as the pump performance (e.g. \nthe pump generated head, or hydraulic efficiency [calculated between the pump suction and \ndischarge]) could also be selected with its own criterion of evaluation.  The analysis conducted on \nthe L9 array result data is essentially an analysis of variance (ANOVA) as detailed in Roy [15]. \n \n5 Taguchi Post-Processing of Results \n5.1 Response Averages \nOne aspect of the Taguchi method utilises response averages, calculated for each location and flow \nrate in relation to a specific geometry parameter variable, to provide detail relating to the influence \nof the geometric factors on the pulsations (and generated head).    For example, to calculate the \nresponse average at location C6 relating to the 3.83% cutwater gap at 1.00Qn, the average of the C6 \npressure pulsations would be calculated from arrangements 1, 2 and 3.  The Taguchi method splits \neach of the four geometrical parameter variables into their \"levels\", termed high [+1], mid [0] and \nlow [-1]; the relation of these levels to the geometrical variables is shown in Table 2.  Sample \ncalculated response average values for each level and for all parameters are shown for the C6 \nlocation in Table 7 for the duty flow condition.  These averages are provided for a selection of \nlocations across the three flow rates in Figures 7 and 8 showing the effect of the cutwater gap and \nvane arrangement respectively.  Due to the discrete geometry changes involved the vane \narrangement graphs are simply joined with straight lines rather than curves.  It should also be noted \nthat the scale for Figure 7d and 8d (both blade pressure locations) is double that used at the other \nlocations.  These graphs together with the general pulsation and performance data provide detail \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 15 \nrelating to the influence of the dominant geometric parameters mentioned above (vane arrangement \nand cutwater gap).  The influence of the cutwater gap is most significant at the impeller outlet and \nat circumferential positions close to the cutwater.  It should be noted that for location C6 (Figure \n7b) that there is a slight reduction in the rate of pulsation reduction as the cutwater increases at \n1.00Qn and 0.25Qn flow rates.  Figure 9a illustrates the strong influence of the cutwater diameter \non the generated head, with the head decreasing as the cutwater gap increases (the power graph, not \nshown, shows similar trends).  The reduction in head and power are as a direct effect of the cutwater \ngap being modified by changing the impeller outlet diameter.  Pump scaling laws predict that the \nhead will reduce with the square of the impeller diameter.  The vane arrangement has an effect on \nthe pulsations at most of the monitored locations.  Typically the inline vane arrangement has larger \npulsations than either of the two staggered vane arrangements, with the 15 degrees vane \narrangement being closer to the 30 degrees vane results rather than the inline arrangement.  The \nvane arrangement has the strongest effect on the pressure pulsations at the leakage flow and volute \nlocations that are remote from the cutwater position.  Reductions in the pressure pulsations local to \nthe cutwater (shown clearly at C6, Figure 8b) and the impeller blade pressure face location, Figure \n8d, due to the vane arrangement are generally less than reductions due to the cutwater gap increase.  \nOn some occasions the 15 degree stagger vane produces lower pulsations, yet at others the 30 \ndegree stagger vane arrangement is lower.  Figure 9b illustrates that the vane arrangement has a \nsmall but noticeable influence on the performance characteristics, with the head and power (not \nshown) reducing slightly when moving from an inline arrangement to a staggered arrangement.  It is \npossible that the reduction in the generated head is caused by additional friction loss present due to \nthe central hub extending to the outlet in the staggered case instead of terminating earlier in the \ninline arrangement.  The pump hydraulic efficiency is generally larger for a staggered impeller \narrangement than an inline vane arrangement.   \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 16 \n5.2 Percentage Contributions  \nOne other important aspect of the Taguchi method is the ability to calculate the percentage \ncontribution of a geometric parameter to a specified quality characteristic.  The percentage \ncontributions are calculated from an analysis of variance that effectively measures how far the \npulsation values for a specific geometry variable vary from the mean.  The amount that the high and \nlow parameter levels vary from the mean provides a measure of that parameter\u2019s influence on a \nparticular quality characteristic.  This is converted in to a percentage value to provide a measure of \nthe contribution relative to the other parameters.  Again percentage contributions have been \ncalculated for each specific location and for all flow rates.  A summary of the contributions for the \nthree flow conditions, at the same locations as earlier, is provided in Tables 8 to 10 for flow rates \n1.00Qn, 0.50Qn and 0.25Qn respectively.  The percentage contributions provide a great deal of \ninformation regarding the importance of the various geometric factors and it is interesting to \nobserve how at some locations the trends are consistent across the flow range, while other locations \nexperience significant variations.   \n \nIn the leakage flow passageway the vane arrangement is the dominant parameter although this \ndominance reduces as the flow rate reduces, especially in locations circumferentially close to the \ncutwater.  The cutwater gap shows a lesser contribution, however this increases as the flow rate \ndecreases and for locations circumferentially close to the cutwater.  The snubber gap and sidewall \nclearance generally have a significantly lesser effect, although this can become more significant at \nlower flow rates.  In the volute, the cutwater is the controlling parameter for pulsations close to the \ncutwater, with this influence decreasing significantly the greater the distance from the cutwater (i.e. \ndown to 16% at C9 for 1.00Qn).  The vane arrangement shows the opposite trend, with its \npercentage contributions being around 30% close to the cutwater and increasing to 80% prior to the \nsplitter.  The trends in pulsation in the volute are relatively consistent across the flow range \nexamined, with the exception that snubber and sidewall clearances have an increased influence at \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 17 \nthe lower flow rates.  At the impeller trailing edge the cutwater gap is effectively the sole parameter \neffecting the pressure pulsation at the duty flow condition and although reduces at lower flows \ncontinues to be dominant.  The vane arrangement shows an increasing influence as the flow \nreduces, with the snubber gap and sidewall varying in importance depending on the flow rate.  In \nrelation to the performance characteristic, the cutwater gap exhibits the largest contribution to the \npump generated head at all flows (this contribution is around 90% at all flow rates).  The power \ncharacteristic is again dominated by the cutwater gap, especially at the higher flow rates, with the \nvane arrangement being of secondary importance.  It is interesting to note that while the head and \npower contributions for the vane arrangement are relatively low, the contribution to the hydraulic \nefficiency at 1.00Qn and 0.50Qn is surprisingly large.     \n \n5.3 Interactive Effects and Predictive Equations \nThe L9 array provides useful information in the form of the percentage contributions, but does not \nprovide information on interaction effects between the geometric parameters.  Of the four factors \ninvestigated, the cutwater gap and the vane arrangement are the two most important by a significant \ndegree.  An L4 Taguchi array can now be used to gauge the interactive effect between these two \nfactors.  The investigation was performed in two stages. For the first stage, a single array was \nformed for each flow rate, with the vane arrangement being limited to either being inline or with a \n30 degree stagger and the cutwater being variable between 3.83% and 7.95%.  Predictive equations \ncan be generated, general form shown by Equation 1 (Schmidt and Launsby [16]), which can gauge \nthe effect of the cutwater gap for both inline and staggered vanes.  The second stage array was \nformed for each flow rate, for cutwater gap values of 3.83% and 7.95% and vane arrangements of \n15 and 30 degree stagger.  This array generated further equations that can be used to investigate the \nrelationship between the pulsation at specific pump locations and the pump geometry.   \nABBAyy ABBAGMP \u00d7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2206\n+\u00d7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2206\n+\u00d7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8eb \u2206\n+=\n222\n  Equation 1 \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 18 \n(a) Stage 1 (Vane: Inline & 30o Stagger, Cutwater Gap Values: 3.83% & 7.95%): The array \nused for stage 1 is indicated in Table 11.  The interaction between the cutwater gap and the vane \narrangement is investigated through representing the response averages in graphical form.  Figure \n10 provides an interaction plot at the 1.00Qn flow condition for a selection of locations within the \npump.  Parallel lines indicate little or no interaction, whereas lines with very different gradients \nindicate an interactive relationship between the parameters being studied.  Thus, interaction does \nexist between the two factors examined, but not at every location. The interaction appears strongest \nclose to the trailing edge of the impeller and almost non-existent at location C6.  Similar plots (not \nshown) are produced for the other flow rates; these indicate that as the flow rate reduces the \nstrength of the interactive effect can change significantly depending on the location.  Table 12 \nprovides a list of the calculated response averages, half effects (\u2206\/2) and grand mean values for a \nselection of pump locations for 1.00Qn and 0.25Qn flow conditions, inclusive of the interactive \neffect.  A comparison of the half effects shows that while the most important factor can switch \nbetween the cutwater gap and the vane arrangement, the interaction effects are never the most \nimportant and at positions away from the impeller are generally the least influential factor.   \n \nFrom the above information predictive equations can be generated to estimate the pressure pulsation \nat any of the reported pump locations, by inserting the grand mean and the half effect values for \neach of the factors in Equation 1.  However, as only two levels are used in the L4 array to form the \nequation the relationship between the pulsation at a location and the geometric parameter is \nassumed linear.  Equation 2 illustrates a sample equation for location C6 at 1.00Qn.   \ny = 0.180 \u20130.054A \u20130.026B \u2013 0.001AB  Equation 2 \nBy varying each of the factors between \u20131 and 1 it is possible to determine what pressure pulsation \nis likely to be obtained with a certain geometry set, even if it is not one of the arrangements that was \nanalysed.  For instance, for a cutwater gap of 5% (a cutwater gap (A) factor of approximately \u20130.5) \nand an inline vane arrangement (a vane arrangement (B) factor of -1), Equation 2 predicts a \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 19 \nnormalised pressure pulsation of 0.232 at location C6 for 1.00Qn.  Similarly a 30 degree staggered \nimpeller (a vane arrangement factor of +1), Equation 2 predicts a value of 0.180.  Both of these \npredicted values seem sensible when compared with the analysis data contained in Table 4.  Due to \nthe marked differences between inline and staggered arrangements the vane arrangement factor is \nrestricted to either \u20131 or +1, as intermediate increments will not provide realistic predictions.  The \nStage 2 provides a better comparison of varying the vane stagger angle. \n \n(b) Stage 2 (Vane 15degree & 30degree stagger, Cutwater Gap Values: 3.83% & 7.95%): The \narray for use in stage 2 is provided in Table 13.  It is not felt that there is a need to present the \ninteraction plots similar to Stage 1, but it is worth noting that the interaction effects continue to be \nincluded.  The calculated response averages and half effects are provided in Table 14 for the same \npump locations shown in Stage 1.  The grand mean has again been calculated and reported in this \ntable for each pump location.  Comparing the half effects indicates that, when considering all \nlocations and both flow rates, the cutwater gap has the strongest influence.  The vane arrangement \n(in this instance relating to the amount of stagger only) is strongest at location C9 for 1.00Qn with \nlarger effects being present in the leakage flow region at the lower flow rate.  The interactive effect \nis again smaller than the other two factors, however it can be seen that at location C4, it can provide \na significant contribution.  The data in Table 14 can be used to generate predictive equations for the \npressure pulsation (or generated head) at any of the pump locations, for example Equation 3 is \ngiven for location C6 at 1.00Qn.   \ny = 0.150 \u20130.053A +0.002B \u2013 0.001AB  Equation 3 \nAgain we can use this equation to predict other geometrical arrangements.  For example, a cutwater \ngap of 5% (cutwater gap factor of approximately \u20130.5), and a 25 degree vane stagger angle (vane \narrangement factor of around +0.33) results in a normalised pressure pulsation value of 0.178 at \nposition C6.  This could be compared, for example, with a 20 degree vane stagger angle (-0.33 vane \narrangement factor), which results in a normalised pulsation of 0.176.  \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 20 \n \n \n6 Rationalisation Leading to a Recommended Design \nDesign recommendations, in the present context are rather complicated, as one cannot easily \noptimise on \u201cpressure pulsations\u201d due to the complex relationships between geometry and pressure \npulsations that vary with the location in the pump and flow rate.  Thus a rationalisation process is \nadopted.  In the present context it is important to reduce pulsations for two main reasons, firstly to \navoid fatigue damage and extend the life of pump components and secondly to reduce the vibration \nlevels due to hydraulic effects.   A typical fatigue failure of an impeller shroud is shown in Figure \n11, where a section of the shroud has been torn away by the pressures exerted on it.   The aim \nwould be to increase component life by reducing the pressure pulsations at the impeller outlet.  \nLarge pulsations in the pump cause vibration and noise and the aim would be to reduce \nhydraulically generated noise and vibration by reducing the overall level of pressure pulsations in \nthe pump.  These requirements could exist separately or together depending on the application.  \nAdditionally, regardless of the motivation behind the process, the benefit gained in terms of \npulsation reduction must be balanced against any possible loss in pump performance. \n \n6.1 Consideration of Component Life \nThe usual initial step in extending component life, where fatigue is a factor, is to minimise any \nstress concentration factors present in the component.  However the stress concentrations in some \nimportant areas, e.g. where the impeller blade connects to the shroud, have limited potential for \nimprovement.  Therefore, with the detailed mechanical design constrained by the impeller \ndimensions, it is important to minimise the hydraulic pressure loadings and fluctuations on the \nimpeller.  It is possible by rational argument to arrive at an improved design through considering \neach geometric factor and its effect.  \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 21 \nThe cutwater gap exerts one of the strongest influences on the pulsations at the impeller outlet.  \nAlthough only the blade pressure face results have been shown, this section will also utilise results \nfor the shroud monitoring locations.  The change in pulsation at the blade pressure face, Figure 7(d), \nshows a slight non-linearity at lower flow rates, this non-linearity is more pronounced at the shroud \nlocations (not shown) indicating that as the cutwater is increased the rate of pressure pulsation \nreduction reduces.  The relationship between the generated head and the cutwater gap, Figure 9(a) is \nlinear at all flow rates with a slight non-linearity at the lowest flow condition.  Thus any increase in \nthe cutwater gap will reduce the pressure pulsation, but this must be tempered by the reduction in \nhead.  However, the non-linearity of the shroud pulsations, especially at lower flow conditions, \nindicates a lesser reduction in pulsations at this location as the cutwater gap increases.  Therefore a \ncutwater gap of around 6% or slightly larger provides a substantial reduction at both the blade and \nshroud locations.  Increasing the cutwater gap above 6% will provide a lower amount of pulsation \nreduction at the shroud for a continuing reduction in head. \n \nThe vane arrangement has a mixed effect on the pressure pulsations at the impeller outlet.  Figure \n8(d) shows that the staggered arrangement appears to decrease the pulsations at the impeller blade \ntip at all flow rates (with the exception of the 30 degree stagger at the lowest flow condition).  At \nshroud locations (not shown), both staggered arrangements provide significant pulsation reductions \nin comparison to the inline blade impeller.   Figure 9(b) indicates that while a staggered impeller \nwill reduce the generated head, the 15 degree stagger involves a greater reduction that the 30 degree \nstagger.  As the failure mechanism for impellers is focused at the impeller vane\/shroud connection \ncaused by pressure across the shroud span at outlet, it is judged that reduction of pressure variation \nat the impeller outlet is of significant importance when considering the life of the impeller.  On this \nbasis a staggered impeller is a better option than the inline impeller.  However there is some \nuncertainty whether the 30 degree stagger should be preferred over the 15 degree arrangement. \n \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 22 \nIt is considered that a tight snubber gap will prevent the pulsation from passing into the leakage \nflow area; causing the pulsation energy to remain close to the impeller outlet. Conversely, a large \nsnubber gap allows the pulsation to pass into the leakage flow region causing large shifts in \npressure, which can cause shuttling if the gap is sufficiently large [17].  Therefore some mid size \nsnubber gap that is large enough to allow the pulsation to pass away from the impeller tip into the \nleakage path, yet not enough to cause the shuttling effect is required. In industry, a general rule of \nthumb relating to the snubber gap is that the length of the snubber gap should be approximately six \ntimes its height in order to attenuate the pressure pulsations.  The shroud thickness for the analysed \nimpeller is 7mm, indicating that the \u201cmaximum\u201d snubber gap according to these rules would be \n0.64% (3mm in this study).  As the snubber gap can cause some reduction in pulsation at the lower \nflow rates, it is recommended that the snubber gap be calculated using the 0.64% figure and \nrounded up to the nearest millimetre. \n \nThe sidewall clearance exhibits only a small effect on the pulsation at the impeller outlet region, \nand any contribution occurs at the lower flow conditions.  Thus, while the sidewall clearance has no \napparent effect on the performance of the pump, results indicate that maintaining a 100% clearance \ngap (12mm for this study) may provide slight benefits at lower flows. \n \n6.2 Pump Noise and Vibration Levels \nThe pump noise and vibration levels due to blade passing frequency relates directly to general \npulsation levels within the pump.  Published literature by Srivastav et al [18] has noted that the \nblade passing frequency dominates the vibration spectra and governs the overall vibration level, \nwith the strength of the frequency being dependent on the radial gap.  These unsteady interactions \nare also related to the radial force due to an imbalance in the pressure field at the impeller outlet, \nwhich is a cause of pump vibration.   Therefore, both the vibration and acoustic levels can be related \nin some manner to the general variation in pressure within in the pump. \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 23 \n \nThe influence of the cutwater gap is largest close to the cutwater, but its influence reduces \nsignificantly over a relatively small distance.  The response averages plotted in Figure 7(a), (C6), \nindicate that there is a greater reduction in the pulsation in these regions up to a cutwater gap of \n6.00% than for larger gap values, for a similar reduction in head.  Location C9, Figure 7(c) indicates \nthat away from the cutwater there is a lesser effect with a similar trend to that shown at locations C4 \nand C6.  Thus, 6.00% appears to provide a substantial pressure pulsation reduction in the pump \nwhile limiting the reduction in the generated head. \n \nA staggered impeller provides significant reductions in pulsation at most locations in the volute, \nespecially those that are circumferentially distant from the cutwater.  Both staggered vane \narrangements provide significant benefits over the inline arrangement at 1.00Qn and 0.50Qn and in \nsome cases 15 degrees is better than 30 degrees.  Figure 9(b) indicates that a 30 degree stagger \ngenerates a consistently higher head than the 15 degree arrangement.  This is unexpected as general \nopinion in industry considers that a mid position stagger forces the jet flow from one side of the \nimpeller to mix with wake flow on the opposite side resulting in relatively high mixing losses.  A \nplot of the axial movement of fluid (i.e. mixing) over a 2D annular area at the impeller outlet is \nplotted in Figure 12 for the 30 degree and 15 degree stagger angles respectively (impeller blade \npositions are shown).  It is immediately apparent that the 30 degree vane stagger arrangement \n(Figure 12a) includes axial mixing of the flow over a considerably larger area than the 15 degree \nstagger (Figure 12b), where a higher level of mixing is indicated by a darker region.  However, this \nlarger mixing region does not appear to have had a significant effect on the pump generated head, \nalthough for other impeller designs this may not be the case.  This is can likely be attributed to the \n30 degree arrangement allowing a large amount of diffusion as the flow exits the impeller resulting \nin a lower fluctuation in flow rate.  Therefore, in this case a 30 degree vane arrangement is \nrecommended but this cannot be a universal recommendation. \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 24 \n \nBoth the snubber gap and sidewall clearance parameters have small effect on the pulsation \naccording to the percentage contributions.  Therefore, for noise and vibration considerations neither \nparameter contributes significantly for the sizes analysed \n \n6.3 Final recommendations \nAlthough the pump geometry has been examined using two different motivations there is some \nagreement between the two.  Consideration of the two rationalised arrangements allows a final \n\u201coptimised\u201d or recommended arrangement to be selected, \n \n\u2022 The minimum cutwater gap should be 6% of the impeller diameter (11mm in this study) \n\u2022 The vane arrangement should use a 30-degree stagger (i.e. a mid position stagger). \n\u2022 The diametral snubber gap should be approximately 0.64% of the impeller diameter, \nrounded to the nearest millimetre (3mm in this study). \n\u2022 The sidewall clearance should be 100% (12mm in this study). \n \n \n7 Conclusions \nA numerical model of an entire double entry, double volute centrifugal pump has been used to \nconduct a parametric study covering four main geometric parameters.  The parameters include the \ncutwater gap, vane arrangement, snubber gap and sidewall clearance, with three different \nconfigurations being used for each parameter.  A total of thirty three transient analyses have been \nconducted, representing 45000 hours of continual analysis time and consisting of over 550 \ngigabytes of analysis and result data.  The pressure levels predicted by the numerical analysis give \nrise to an enormous and interesting data set.  The results have been presented by concentrating on \nselected locations around the pump.   \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 25 \n \nAn L9 Taguchi array has been successfully constructed for fifteen pressure monitoring locations and \nthree performance characteristics.  The analysis of the array identified the dominant geometrical \ninfluences on the pulsations and the performance of the pump.  In general, the cutwater gap and \nvane arrangement are the two strongest influences on the pressure pulsation, with the snubber gap \nand sidewall clearance being considerably less important.  Detailed information has been presented \non pressure pulsations and performance characteristics both in terms of non-dimensional values and \npercentage contributions, which will assist understanding of the pump behaviour and the effect of \nthe geometric variables. \n \nSmaller L4 Taguchi arrays have been employed to determine the importance of the interactive effect \nbetween the cutwater gap and vane arrangement.  The interactive effect can be more important than \nthe parameter of secondary importance, but is never as large as the dominant parameter.  Basic \ninformation has been presented, which allows predictive equations to be obtained that can identify \nexpected pressure pulsations at specific pump locations for arrangements different from those \nanalysed.  The equations are limited to linear relationships and are bounded by the maximum and \nminimum values used for the relevant geometric parameters used in the analyses. \n \nThe pressure pulsation information has been used with a view to firstly, increasing the component \nlife and secondly, reduce the noise and vibration.  This has been achieved through a rationalisation \nprocess and geometric recommendations have been derived that satisfy both requirements.  These \nguidelines should be useful to designers.   \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported throughout by Clyde Pumps Limited and Cranfield University.   \n  \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n \nout 02\/12\/2008 \n 26 \n \nReferences \n[1.] Uchida, N., Inaichi, K and Shirai, T.
