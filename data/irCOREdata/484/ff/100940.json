We find\nthat as nucleation is intrinsically slow, only very slow microscopic dynamics strongly affect how\nnucleation occurs. The composition of the nucleus at the top of the nucleation barrier is much less\nsensitive to slow microscopic dynamics than is the composition of the nucleus once it is postcritical.\nHowever, slow dynamics affects not only the rate but also the pathway, which no longer goes over\nthe saddle point in the free energy. We also find that the slow microscopic dynamics can cause\nsampling problems in an algorithm developed to calculate nucleation rates, and so cause it to predict\nthe rate incorrectly. \u00a9 2008 American Institute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2928844\u0004\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNucleation of a new thermodynamic phase is an acti-\nvated process, and so it can be extremely slow.1,2 A stable\nphase is cooled, compressed, or otherwise moved into a state\nwhere it is no longer the equilibrium phase. There is then a\nthermodynamic driving force for the transformation to the\nequilibrium phase. This new phase can then form, starting off\nwith a microscopic nucleus which grows into a bulk phase.\nHowever, due to the free-energy cost of the nucleus\/bulk\ninterface, the free energy initially increases as the micro-\nscopic nucleus of the equilibrium phase forms. Thus the free\nenergy goes through a maximum; it is this maximum in the\nfree energy that makes nucleation an activated process. The\nmaximum in free energy is the free energy needed to create\nthe nucleus at the top of the barrier \u0001F*. The basic theory of\nnucleation is classical nucleation theory. It expresses the\nnucleation rate per molecule or per spin as the product of a\nkinetic prefactor \u0002 and the exponential of the free-energy\nbarrier \u0001F*,1,2\nrate = \u0002 exp\u0001\u2212 \u0001F*\/kT\u0002 . \u00011\u0002\nAs the rate varies exponentially with \u0001F*, attention is usu-\nally focused on this barrier. This is the probability that a\nnucleus is centered on any one molecule or spin. The pref-\nactor is usually taken to be just one over a characteristic\ntimescale, such as the time for a molecule or colloidal par-\nticle to diffuse its own diameter or for a spin to flip. The\nnucleation pathway is then assumed to be determined solely\nby the free-energy landscape; see Refs. 3\u20136 for examples.\nFor example, the free energy of the nucleus of a binary mix-\nture of components A and B may depend on two variables,\nthe number of molecules of A, NA, and the number of B, NB.7\nThen the nucleus could in principle take any one of the many\npathways in the NA-NB plane. However, if the pathway is\ndetermined by the free energy, then the nucleus will follow a\npath over the saddle point in the NA-NB plane.\nHowever, many systems possess slow microscopic dy-\nnamics. For example, recently Sanz et al.8 studied the crys-\ntallization of a model of a colloidal mixture of oppositely\ncharged particles. They found that moves where a pair of\noppositely charged particles swap places were very slow.\nThese slow dynamics dramatically affect the nucleation dy-\nnamics: if these swaps are accelerated by changing their\nMonte Carlo kinetics, then a different crystal structure forms.\nAlso, Schilling and Frenkel9 found that the crystallization of\nshort rods was inhibited by the slow kinetics of rods rotating\nto align and form a second layer. A first layer formed swiftly\nbut formation of the second was inhibited.\nThis situation, where some microscopic dynamics are\nfast but others are much slower, is precisely the situation we\nstudy here. We define a simple toy model that has these\nfeatures and the simplicity of the model allows us to deter-\nmine the nucleation pathway essentially exactly via direct\nsimulations. This in contrast to earlier work where the tech-\nniques of umbrella sampling10 and forward flux\nsampling11\u201313 \u0001FFS\u0002 were used. As we will see, these tech-\nniques may fail in the presence of slow microscopic\ndynamics.\nSo, there are two very different types of slow dynamics.\nThere is nucleation, in which the slowness comes from the\nhigh free-energy cost of forming a critical nucleus that may\nhave tens or hundreds of molecules or spins, and there is\nslow microscopic dynamics in which a motion of a single\nmolecule or spin is very slow. Here we want to understand\nwhat happens when a system has both forms of slow dynam-\nics. In particular, we want to better understand how nucle-\nation occurs when the nucleus free energy is a function of\ntwo variables, one of which is very slow. The situation where\nboth are very slow is trivial; this just corresponds to a very\na\u0002Tel.: 44\u00010\u00021483-686793. FAX: 44\u00010\u00021483-686781.

Our two variables will be nf, the number\nof fast spins in the nucleus, and ns, the number of slow spins.\nWe will introduce a simple model in which we can con-\ntinuously vary the speed of the slow variable. We will vary\nthe rate of flips of the slow spins. We then study nucleation\nin this model and find that as we slow down the flips of the\nslow spins, the pathway of nucleation moves away from the\nsaddle point. The nucleation pathway is then not determined\nby the form of the free energy alone; purely dynamic factors\nmust also be taken into account. However, pushing the path-\nway away from the saddle point requires that the slow spin\nflips be very slow. As we move away from the saddle point,\nthe free-energy factor in the nucleation rate, exp\u0001\u2212\u0001F* \/kT\u0002,\ndecreases exponentially, so doing so is only favorable if the\nslow spin flips are exponentially slow. Thus the nucleation\npathway is much less sensitive to slow dynamics than the\npostcritical growth of the new phase.\nWe also present the results of calculations using the FFS\nalgorithm of Allen et al.11\u201313 This algorithm was developed\nto efficiently calculate the rates of barrier-crossing processes.\nWe find that very slow dynamics cause the algorithm to\nsample poorly.\nThe next section describes both the free energy and dy-\nnamics of our model. We present and discuss our results in\nthe third section, and the final section is a conclusion.\nII. MODEL\nWe require a simple model both because we are inter-\nested in understanding the generic properties of nucleation in\nthe presence of slow dynamics and because we need a model\nthat is not computationally intensive in order to be able to\ncompute the rate of an activated process via direct simula-\ntion. Thus we study nucleation where the nucleus has a\nsimple phenomenological free energy.\nA. Phenomenological free energy\nThe free energy is\n\u0001F\u0001nf,ns\u0002 = \u0001F1\n*\n\u2212 c\u0001nf + ns \u2212 n*\u00022 \u2212 xnfns,\n\u00012\u0002\nnf,ns = 0,1,2, . . . .\nWe will refer to nf and ns as the numbers of fast and slow\nspins, respectively. They are non-negative integer variables.\nBy construction, along the nf and ns axes, there are equal\nnucleation barriers of height \u0001F1\n*\n. These barriers occur for\nnuclei of n* spins. The free energy \u0001F we use in our calcu-\nlations is plotted in Fig. 1.\nThe parameter c=\u0001F1\n* \/ \u0001n*\u00022 so that the free energy\n\u0001F=0 at the origin. This leaves the parameter x. We use only\nx\u00030, for which there is a saddle point in the free energy \u0001F\nin the nf-ns plane. It is at nf\n*\n=n\ns\n*\n=n* \/ \u00032+x \/ \u00012c\u0002\u0004 and a free\nenergy below that of the barriers along the nf and ns axes.\nThus if the dynamics of our fast and slow spins are equal,\nnucleation occurs over this saddle point and along the line\nns=nf. The saddle point free energy is\n\u0001FS\n*\n= \u0001F1\n*\n\u2212\n\u0001n*\u00022x\n4 + x\/c\n. \u00013\u0002\nAt all times, we will work at an on-axis nucleation barrier of\n\u0001F1\n*\n=16kT at n*=16 spins and with x=0.15. Then the saddle\npoint is \u0001FS\n*\n=10kT at nf =ns=5.\nB. Dynamics\nThe free energy does not distinguish between fast and\nslow spins; exchanging the values of nf and ns does not\nchange the free energy. However, the dynamics will in gen-\neral distinguish between the fast and slow spins. The dynam-\nics of the nucleus are simple. At each time, there are, by\nconstruction, four possible moves: adding a fast spin, losing\na fast spin, gaining a slow spin, and losing a slow spin. The\nrates of these four moves are as follows:\n\u00014\u0002\nThese dynamics preserve detailed balance.10 The character-\nistic timescales for the dynamics of fast and slow spins are\n1 \/r+ and 1 \/ \u0001r+s\u0002, respectively. We will use 1 \/r+ as our char-\nacteristic timescale and measure all times in units of 1 \/r+.\nThe parameter s\u00041 controls the relative speed of the dynam-\nics of the slow spins. We simulate the nucleus using a stan-\ndard Gillespie-type algorithm.14\nIII. RESULTS\nUsing the free energy and dynamics described above, we\nhave calculated both nucleation rates and paths. In each case,\nwe start with a nucleus with ns=nf =0 and take the nucle-\nation time to be that to reach a point on the free-energy\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color\u0002 Plot of the free energy of the nucleus, \u0001F, of Eq. \u00012\u0002 as a\nfunction of the number of fast spins, nf, and the number of slow spins, ns.\nNote that the free energy is symmetric around the line ns=nf. The parameter\nvalues are as follows: \u0001F1\n*=16kT and x=0.15. The free energy is cut off\nbelow 0 to improve the clarity of the plot. The saddle point is at ns=nf =5.\n214513-2 Richard P.

The nucleation rate is then 1 over the average\nof this time.\nIn Fig. 2, we have plotted averaged nucleation paths. We\ncalculate an averaged path as follows. After each move of\nour simulation, we increment two counters. One counts the\nnumber of times our path samples each value of the nucleus\nsize, nf +ns, and the other counts the fraction of fast spins at\nthat particular value of the total nucleus size. The ratio of\nthese counters gives the average fraction of fast spins as a\nfunction of the nucleus size, which we use to obtain the\naverage paths in the nf-ns plane in Fig. 2.\nIf s=1, then the fast and slow spins are completely\nequivalent and we expect nucleation to occur very close to\nequilibrium, i.e., the nucleus will always be close to its mini-\nmum free energy which is along the line ns=nf. On this line,\nthe barrier height for nucleation is a minimum. The black\ncurve in Fig. 2 is the path for s=1. We see that indeed the\npath goes through the saddle point at nf =ns=5 and that it lies\nalong the line ns=nf where the free energy is lowest. Thus,\nfor s=1, the situation is straightforward. The free energy\ndominates and dictates that nucleation occurs over the saddle\npoint in the free-energy landscape.\nThe other extreme is s=0. Then the cluster that forms is\npurely composed of fast spins; ns=0 at all times. The cluster\nis now forced to move along the nf axis in Fig. 1. Along this\naxis, the barrier to be overcome is \u0001F1\n*\n=16kT, which is 6kT\nhigher than that at the saddle point. This barrier increase is\npredicted to slow down nucleation by a factor of exp\u00016\u0002\n\u0005400. Our calculations yield nucleation rates of 5\u000510\u22125r+\nfor s=1 and 1\u000510\u22128r+ for s=0. This is a slow down by a\nfactor of 5000. A simple estimate based on the change in the\nbarrier height underpredicts the difference. This is possibly\ndue to the fact that for s=0, there is only one path, that with\nns=0, while for s=1, paths that do not precisely go over the\nsaddle point may still contribute to and so increase the rate.\nHaving considered the two extremes, let us consider in-\ntermediate values of s, i.e., less than 1 but nonzero. Then the\nnucleus will contain slow spins but then there is a trade-off\nbetween having more slow spins and so a lower free energy\nbut having to wait longer for more slow spins to flip. The\nnucleation rate is plotted as a function of the slowness of the\nslow spin dynamics in Fig. 3. We see that the nucleation rate\ndecreases with decreasing s. It does so over a very large\nrange of values of s. Note that in Fig. 3, the rate only pla-\nteaus for s\u000610\u22128, comparable to the nucleation rate in the\ns=0 limit. This is because until 1 \/ \u0001r+s\u0002 is much larger than\nthe time taken to surmount the barrier along the nf axis, \u0001F1\n*\n,\nit is still favorable for the nucleus to have at least one or two\nslow spins. Unless the time to flip a single slow spin 1 \/s\n\u0007exp\u0001\u0001F1\n* \/kT\u0002, the nucleus will typically have at least one\nslow spin, and so nucleation will not occur directly along the\nnf axis and the rate will depend on the value of s.\nThe process of growth is much faster than that of nucle-\nation. In postcritical growth, the nucleus gains spins at a rate\nof order r+. Therefore, as soon as s\b1, the growing post-\ncritical nucleus is far from equilibrium. It grows almost en-\ntirely by gaining fast spins. This is clearly seen in Fig. 2,\nwhere we see that once the path for s=10\u22123 \u0001cyan\u0002 has\npassed the top of the barrier \u0001marked by a cross\u0002, it is almost\nhorizontal. Further decreases in s then have little effect on\ngrowth.\nA. Results of FFS calculations\nHere we apply the FFS technique of Allen et al.11\u201313 to\ncalculate a nucleation rate. This is one of the techniques used\nto calculate the nucleation rate when it is too small to be\ncalculated via direct simulation.2 As we have calculated the\nrate essentially exactly via direct simulation, we can compare\nthe results of FFS calculations to exact results to see whether\nor not the FFS technique can cope with the slow dynamics.\nThe FFS results are shown as red crosses in Fig. 3. Each\npoint is the result of a FFS calculation in which nc=10 000\nconfigurations are stored at each interface. We plot the re-\nsults of four independent runs for each value of s in order to\nshow the scatter in the results. The order parameter used is\nnT=ns+nf. The first interface \u0001used for the flux calculation\u0002\nis at nT=2 and subsequent interfaces are at values of nT\n=4,6 ,8 , . . .. See Refs. 11\u201313 for details of the technique.\nWe see that for s\t10\u22123, the FFS calculation with 10 000\nstored configurations gives a good estimate of the rate. It also\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Plots of the averaged paths taken by nucleating\nclusters in the nf-ns plane.

Phys. 128, 214513 \u00022008\u0001\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jcp.aip.org\/jcp\/copyright.jsp\ngives the s=0 limit of the rate correctly. For s\t10\u22123 there is\na systematic slight overestimate of the rate, which may be\ndue to FFS neglecting the time the system spends actually on\nthe barrier. This is minor. However, for s=10\u22124 and 10\u22125, the\nscatter in the runs is very large, while for s=10\u22126, FFS pre-\ndicts a rate that is already in the s=0 limit. This is incorrect;\nin fact, it is approximately an order of magnitude higher.\nExamination of the paths FFS is sampling \u0001not shown\u0002 show\nthat here FFS is not sampling the paths correctly; it samples\npaths that lie too close to the nf axis. From Fig. 3, it is clear\nthat when snc\n1, the FFS sampling is poor, leading to large\nscatter, whereas for snc\b1, the FFS technique completely\nmisses the ns\u00030 paths, and so predicts, with little scatter, an\nincorrect rate. We have also performed simulations with nc\n=100 \u0001not shown\u0002 and then the point where the scatter in the\nFFS rates becomes very large is moved to larger values of s.\nLet us return to the findings of Sanz et al.8 and consider\nthem in the light of our results for FFS. In their system, the\nslow dynamics is the swapping of charged particles of oppo-\nsite charges. If we denote the natural frequency of such\nswaps by f , then if ncf\b1, where nc is their number of\nconfigurations at an interface, we can easily understand their\nfinding that the FFS algorithm sampled a pathway that pro-\nceeds without these slow swaps. If a move such as a swap\noccurs with a very low frequency, a simulation simply will\nnot sample it. This is just like the situation with the current\nmodel with, say, s=10\u22126 and nc=100. From Fig. 2, we see\nthat the true nucleation path for this value of s has approxi-\nmately one slow spin. On average, it will take 106 steps for\nthe nucleus to acquire one slow spin, but of course, if our\nFFS simulation is only working with nc=100 configurations\nand the runs from interface to interface take only a few steps,\nthe simulation may never sample a single slow spin flip and\nso miss the true nucleation pathway.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe have found that slow microscopic dynamics can\nchange not only the nucleation rate but also its pathway. In\nour simple model, the nucleation rate dropped by more than\nthree orders of magnitude as the slow microscopic dynamics\nslowed down by nine orders of magnitude. In other systems\nwith larger nucleation barriers, we expect even larger reduc-\ntions in the nucleation rate over even larger ranges in the\nspeed of the slow variable. In the presence of slow micro-\nscopic dynamics, the pathway for nucleation will not in gen-\neral go over the saddle point in the free-energy landscape.\nHowever, as nucleation is itself an intrinsically slow process,\nthe pathway is less sensitive to the speed of the slow dynam-\nics before the nucleation barrier than afterwards, when the\nnucleus is growing rapidly. For example, we saw in Fig. 2\nthat for s=10\u22123, the composition of the critical nucleus is not\nthe equilibrium one: nf \/ns\u00053 not 1 as it is at the saddle\npoint. However, once the nucleus has surmounted the barrier,\nthe pathway is almost horizontal: the composition moves\ndramatically towards being almost pure fast spins, nf \/ns\u00071,\nand so is very far from the equilibrium composition.\nMost of what we know about the molecular details of\nnucleation we have learnt from simulation.2 Quantitative cal-\nculation of the nucleation rate usually requires the use of\nspecialized techniques such as the umbrella sampling\ntechnique10 used by Schilling and Frenkel9 or FFS.8,11\u201313 We\nhave seen that FFS may fail when there are slow microscopic\ndynamics. These cause sampling problems that mean the\nnucleation pathways are not correctly sampled and hence the\nnucleation rate is not calculated correctly. In addition, with\numbrella sampling, even if the complete free-energy land-\nscape is obtained, as the nucleation pathway is not solely\ndetermined by the free energy, this is not enough to calculate\nthe rate. In conclusion, a straightforward application of ex-\nisting techniques may not be enough to accurately calculate\nnucleation rates in these systems and so further develop-\nments may be required.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge stimulating discussions\nwith R.
