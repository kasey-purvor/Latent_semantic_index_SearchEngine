The effects of electrode movements on time-lapse resistivity tomography \nare investigated using a simple analytical model and real data. The correspondence \nbetween the model and the data is sufficiently good to be able to predict the effects of \nelectrode movements with reasonable accuracy. For the linear electrode arrays and 2D \ninversions under consideration, the data are much more sensitive to longitudinal than \ntransverse or vertical movements. Consequently the model can be used to invert the \nlongitudinal offsets of the electrodes from their known baseline positions using only \nthe time-lapse ratios of the apparent resistivity data. The example datasets are taken \nfrom a permanently installed electrode array on an active lobe of a landslide. Using \ntwo sets with different levels of noise and subsurface resistivity changes, it is found \nthat the electrode positions can be recovered to an accuracy of 4 % of the baseline \nelectrode spacing. This is sufficient to correct the artefacts in the resistivity images, \nand provides for the possibility of monitoring the movement of the landslide and its \ninternal hydraulic processes simultaneously using electrical resistivity tomography \nonly. \n \nKeywords: Inverse theory; Tomography; Time series analysis; Hydrogeophysics. \nIntroduction \nElectrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) is the most widely applied \ngeophysical technique used to investigate landslides (Jongmans & Garambois 2007). \nIt produces 2D or 3D images of the spatial subsurface resistivity structure of the \nlandslide. Due to the strong dependence of resistivity on saturation, fracturing, clay \ncontent and weathering, it is often used to image failure surfaces (Perrone et al. 2004; \nLapenna et al. 2005; Lebourg et al. 2005; Naudet et al. 2008; Sass et al. 2008). \nRepeated time-lapse resistivity surveys have been carried out to assess the effects of \nsaturation in landslide-prone areas (Suzuki & Higashi 2001; Friedel et al. 2006; \nJomard et al. 2007), and conceptual models have been developed to relate time-lapse \nresistivity changes to slope failure (Piegari et al. 2009). Recently several researchers \nhave highlighted the possibility of continuously monitoring landslide bodies using \nautomated resistivity tomography systems with permanently installed electrode \nnetworks (Lapenna et al. 2005; Meric et al. 2005). Prototype systems have now been \ndeployed to monitor a number of active landslides using this approach (Supper et al. \n2008; Chambers et al. 2009; Lebourg et al. 2009). By providing information on \nsubsurface hydrogeological changes with high spatial and temporal resolution, these \nsystems aim to reveal the hydraulic precursors to landslide movement. \nAlthough time-lapse ERT is particularly well-suited to monitoring hydraulic \nprocesses (Kuras et al. 2009), the measured potentials do not depend solely on the \nresistivity, but also on the positions of the electrodes. In geoelectrical imaging these \nare usually assumed to be known and accurate. Recently several groups have \nquantified the systematic errors that are caused in resistivity data by errors in the \npositions of electrodes (Zhou & Dahlin 2003; Oldenborger et al. 2005; Wilkinson et \nal. 2008). Where permanently installed electrodes have been used for time-lapse \nmonitoring, it has typically been assumed that the electrode locations are static. But \nthis is clearly not the case if they are installed on an active landslide. To our \nknowledge, no-one has previously addressed the artefacts caused by mobile electrodes \nin time-lapse geoelectrical imaging (although Supper et al. (2008) qualitatively \nidentified anomalous changes in potential which they attributed to landslide \nmovement, and Zhou & Dahlin (2003) and Oldenborger et al. (2005) showed similar \nartefacts caused by a static misplaced electrode). However this problem has been \nrecognised for several years in the related discipline of medical Electrical Impedance \nTomography (EIT), since posture changes and breathing cause electrodes to move \nduring imaging (Zhang & Patterson 2005). Research is ongoing in EIT imaging to \ninvert the time-lapse impedance data to recover the unknown time-varying electrode \npositions simultaneously with the impedance distribution (Blott et al. 1998; Soleimani \net al. 2006; G\u00f3mez-Laberge & Alder 2008; Dai et al. 2008; Li et al. 2008). Since \nmedical EIT usually involves weak impedance contrasts, these approaches use one-\nstep linearised inversions that are less well suited to imaging the much stronger \nresistivity contrasts that occur in geoelectrical surveys. \nIn this paper, we develop a new approach to recover the movements of \npermanently installed electrodes that are part of an array being used to monitor a \nlandslide. We briefly describe the landslide research site and the Automated time-\nLapse ERT (ALERT) monitoring system, and we discuss the baseline image of the \nresistivity structure of the landslide body. Significant movements of the electrodes \noccurred due to landslide activity in the winter months after the baseline imaging. We \nshow that, if the electrode positions are not corrected, these movements cause \nappreciable artefacts in later resistivity images. Although the effects on the data of \nresistivity changes and electrode movements are non-linear and coupled, by making \nreasonable assumptions we propose a method that allows the electrode positions to be \ndetermined independently. We discuss the validity these assumptions and identify \nsituations where more sophisticated techniques might be required. Finally, by using \nreal time-lapse data from the landslide research site, we demonstrate that we can \nidentify and correct the electrode positions before inverting for the resistivity \ndistribution. This removes the image artefacts and improves the fit between the model \nand the data without having to repeatedly visit the site to resurvey the electrode \nlocations. \nResearch Site \nThe data sets in this paper were acquired from an active landslide site 12 km to \nthe west of Malton, North Yorkshire, UK. The site is being monitored with an \nALERT system (Kuras et al. 2009; Ogilvy et al. 2009) to study the hydraulics of \nlandslide processes in near real-time. The system is battery powered with wind and \nsolar recharging and operates fully autonomously with no need for user intervention. \nThe ALERT instrument uses wireless telemetry (in this case GPRS) to communicate \nwith an office based PC that runs control software and a database management \nsystem. The control software is used to schedule data acquisition, while the database \nmanagement system automatically stores, processes and inverts the remotely streamed \nresistivity data. \nThe landslide research site is located on a south facing valley side with a slope \nof approximately 12\u00b0. The bedrock geology, from the base to top of slope, comprises \nthe Lias Group Redcar Mudstone Formation (RMF), Staithes Sandstone and \nCleveland Ironstone Formation (SSF), and Whitby Mudstone Formation (WMF), \nwhich are overlain at the top of the hill by the Dogger Sandstone Formation (DF) (see \nFigure 1). The bedrock is relatively flat lying with a gentle dip of a few degrees to the \nnorth (British Geological Survey 1983). Slope failure at the site is occurring in the \nweathered WMF, which is highly prone to landsliding. The landslide is a very slow to \nslow moving composite multiple earth slide - earth flow, according to the \nclassification scheme proposed by Cruden and Varnes (1996). The upper sections to \nthe north are characterised by rotational slides with multiple minor scarps and \ncracking within the WMF, which evolve into heavily fissured earth flows that form \ndiscrete lobes of slipped material overriding the SSF bedrock to the south. Borehole \nlogs from the western lobe (Figure 1) indicate a maximum thickness of slipped \nmaterial within the earthflows of approximately 5 m. \nThe data were collected from one of five permanently installed parallel linear \nelectrode arrays running from the base to the top of the hill (dark and light blue lines, \nFigure 1). These formed an initially regular rectangular grid of 38 m \u00d7 147.25 m. \nEach linear array comprised 32 electrodes initially spaced at 4.75 m (Chambers et al. \n2009), and the inter-line spacing was 9.5 m. The array that was selected for this study \nran along one of the active lobes of the landslide (dark blue line, Figure 1). Data were \nacquired from the arrays on a daily basis using a dipole-dipole measurement scheme \nwith dipole lengths of a = 4.75, 9.5, 14.25 and 19 m, and dipole separations na, where \nn = 1 - 8. Each of the 516 measurements was made twice in reciprocal configurations \n(Parasnis 1988), with the mean of the two measurements being taken as the apparent \nresistivity for that particular configuration. The difference between the measurements \nwas used to calculate the standard error in the mean for each configuration, which we \nrefer to as its reciprocal error. This was used to estimate the levels of the random error \nin the data and to weight the data accordingly in the resistivity inversions. The \ndistributions of reciprocal errors in the data sets are given in Table 1. The greater \nreciprocal errors in August 2009 compared to either March 2008 or March 2009 are \ndue to the increased contact resistances typically encountered in the summer months \ncaused by drying of the ground in the vicinity of the electrodes. The mean, minimum \nand maximum contact resistances in August 2009 were 535 \u2126, 175 \u2126, and 3415 \u2126 \nrespectively. The corresponding values for March 2009 were 165 \u2126, 115 \u2126, and \n365 \u2126. Nevertheless, even in August the data quality is still excellent, with over 90 % \nof the data having reciprocal errors <1 %. \n \nTable 1. Reciprocal error distributions \nReciprocal error level Fraction of data set below reciprocal error level \n March 2008 March 2009 August 2009 \n0.10 % 75 % 72 % 52 % \n0.25 % 92 % 91 % 71 % \n0.50 % 98 % 98 % 84 % \n1.0 % 99 % 99 % 92 % \n5.0 % 100 % 100 % 97 % \n \nThe ALERT system and electrodes were installed in March 2008 at which \ntime the electrode positions were surveyed using the Leica SmartRover, a real-time \nkinematic GPS receiver with centimetric accuracy. The baseline dataset used in this \nstudy was acquired shortly after installation in the same month. The inverted \nresistivity image of these data is shown in Figure 2 and the raw data are shown as a \npseudosection in Figure 3a. The data were inverted with the Res2DInv software using \na finite-element method to permit the inclusion of topography, a complete Gauss\u2013\nNewton solver, and L2 model smoothness and data discrepancy constraints (Loke et \nal. 2003). Convergence was achieved after 5 iterations with an extremely good fit \nbetween the measured and inverted data, as indicated by an RMS error of 1.02 %. The \nimage exhibits resistivity variations consistent with the expected stratigraphic \nsequence, with the mudstone formations significantly more conductive than the SSF. \nThere is clear evidence of slipped conductive WMF material overlying the SSF \nbetween distances of 60 m and 80 m. Within the WMF, the higher surface resistivities \nin the vicinity of the main scarp are most likely due to increased localised fracturing. \nThe position of the WMF \/ SSF boundary was inferred from the resistivity image, \nwhile the SSF \/ RMF boundary has been positioned to match the log of an auger hole \nat x = -6 m. In recent years, the active lobes of the landslide have been observed to \nmove by many tens of centimetres per annum. Movement typically occurs in the \nwinter months of January and February when the slope is at its wettest. During this \nperiod water can be observed accumulating in the basins caused by rotational slips \nnear the top of the slope, and can be seen emerging from the front of the lobes. \nDrainage from the site also occurs along a spring line at the base of the SSF, where \ngroundwater appears to be running off the surface of the less permeable underlying \nRMF. Recently installed piezometers have revealed elevated pore pressures at the \nfailure planes within the slipped WMF and at the interface between the slipped WMF \nmaterial and the underlying SSF, as indicated by head increases within the lobes of \nalmost 2 m during the winter as compared to the summer months. \nIn this paper, we consider two subsequent resistivity data sets, both acquired \nafter the winter 2008\/2009 period of movement had finished. The first of these sets \nwas measured in March 2009 under similar saturation and temperature conditions to \nthe baseline set of March 2008. The second was from August 2009, at which time the \nelectrode positions were resurveyed. The raw data for March 2009 are shown as a \nresistivity pseudosection in Figure 3b and as a normalised pseudosection (i.e. divided \nby the baseline data) in Figure 3c. Similarly the August 2009 data are shown in Figure \n3d and Figure 3e. Inverted images of these data are shown in Figure 4a and Figure 4c \nrespectively. The images and pseudosections were produced under the assumption \nthat the electrodes had not moved from their March 2008 positions. Compared to the \nbaseline set, there is noticeable new structure in the regions of the images highlighted \nby the dashed ellipses. This is revealed more clearly in Figure 4b and Figure 4d, \nwhich show the March and August 2009 images normalised to the baseline image. It \nis also worth noting that the RMS misfit errors (1.45 % and 1.46 % respectively) are \nsomewhat larger than that of the baseline set. These changes are also clearly visible in \nthe resistivity and normalised pseudosections in Figure 3, appearing as linear \nanomalies radiating from the region centred on electrode 9. The changes seemed \nunlikely to be due to the sudden appearance of genuine localised resistivity structures, \nsince no similar anomalies were present in the baseline image or pseudosection. \nTherefore we concluded that they were most likely to be artefacts caused by the use of \nincorrect electrode positions. \nEffects of electrode movement \nTo investigate further, we examined the effects on the measured apparent \nresistivities caused by changing the positions of the electrodes in linear dipole-dipole \nconfigurations. The electrode movements between March 2008 and August 2009 are \nshown in Figure 5 as longitudinal (along-line) and transverse (perpendicular) offset \ndistances. The linear array runs approximately S-N from the bottom to the top of the \nactive lobe, so positive longitudinal offsets are to the north (up the slope) and positive \ntransverse offsets are to the east (towards a gully between adjacent landslide lobes). \nTo quantify the effects of these offsets we examine the ratio ra of the measured \napparent resistivity to its baseline value. This is calculated using the same geometric \nfactor for the baseline and subsequent measurements; therefore ra is also given by the \nratio of the measured transfer resistances. We also use a simplified analytical \nexpression to model ra for electrode movements on the surface of a homogeneous \nhalf-space which also has a time-dependent resistivity. We denote the baseline \ndistances between the electrodes A, B, M, and N to be AM, BM, AN, and BN, and the \ndistances at the later time to be AM\u2032, BM\u2032, AN\u2032, and BN\u2032. We also denote the ratio of \nthe homogeneous half-space resistivities to be r = \u03c1\u2032\/\u03c1. The apparent resistivity ratio \nfor the homogeneous half-space is then given by \n \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+\u2212\u2212\n+\u2212\u2212\n=\nBNANBMAM\nBNANBMAMrra 1111\n'\n1\n'\n1\n'\n1\n'\n1\n. (1) \nThe effects of electrode movement and changing resistivity ratio are shown in Figure \n6. The along-line electrode spacing is taken to be 4.75 m, and a particular electrode \n(in this case electrode 9 at 38 m) is offset from its assumed position. Figure 6a shows \nthe effect of a longitudinal movement of 1 m on the apparent resistivities of the \ndipole-dipole configurations with a = 4.75 m and n = 1 - 4. Similarly the effects of a \n1 m transverse movement on the same configurations are shown in Figure 6b. It is \nclear that the linear dipole-dipole configuration is much more sensitive to longitudinal \nelectrode movements than transverse. It can be seen by comparing Figure 6a with \nFigure 6c, which shows the effects of simultaneous 1 m longitudinal and transverse \nmovements, that the effect of the transverse movements is typically negligible (with \nthe exception of n = 1 where the largest change is ra \u2248 1.6 in Figure 6a, and ra \u2248 1.5 in \nFigure 6c). In Figure 6d, the effects of changes in subsurface resistivity as well as \nelectrode movements are shown. For each n-level we have used a different resistivity \nratio r to approximate the effects of resistivity changes that vary with the depth-of-\ninvestigation (Barker 1989). \nThe sensitivity of a given configuration to longitudinal and transverse \nelectrode movements can be calculated, in the case of a homogeneous half-space, \nfrom the expressions for the geometric factor  \n BNANBMAM\nK\n1111\n2\n+\u2212\u2212\n=\npi\n (2) \nand its total differential  \n \n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+\u2212\u2212= 2222\n2\n2 BN\ndBN\nAN\ndAN\nBM\ndBM\nAM\ndAMKdK\npi\n. (3) \nWe consider the fractional changes in apparent resistivity |d\u03c1a\/\u03c1a| = |dK\/K| caused by \nsmall longitudinal (dl) and transverse displacements (dt) on the slope. In each case the \ndisplacements are expressed as fractions of the unit electrode spacing, a. The results \nshow that |d\u03c1a\/\u03c1a| \u221d |dl\/a|, but that |d\u03c1a\/\u03c1a| \u221d |dt\/a|2. Therefore for small \ndisplacements dl < a and dt < a it is clear that longitudinal offsets will cause greater \nchanges than transverse offsets. We define displacement sensitivities in the \nlongitudinal and transverse directions as Sl = |d\u03c1a\/\u03c1a| \/ |dl\/a| and \nSt = |d\u03c1a\/\u03c1a| \/ |dt\/a|2 respectively. These are listed with their functional forms and \nnumerical values for dipole-dipole and Wenner-Schlumberger configurations in Table \n2 and Table 3 respectively.    \nIt is interesting to note from Figure 6 that the magnitudes of the changes in ra \ncaused by longitudinal electrode movement do not vary rapidly with n. This can be \nunderstood by examining the longitudinal sensitivities in Table 2. For dipole-dipole \nconfigurations d\u03c1a\/\u03c1a is only weakly dependent on n (in fact for large n it tends to a \nconstant). Interestingly, for the Wenner-Schlumberger array d\u03c1a\/\u03c1a varies \napproximately as 1\/n for displacements of the outer electrodes, although for the inner \nelectrodes it again depends only weakly on n and tends to a constant. The results in \nTable 2 show that dipole-dipole measurements are somewhat more sensitive to \nlongitudinal electrode displacements than Wenner-Schlumberger configurations, and \nhence are better suited to tracking movements of the electrodes using resistivity data. \nTable 2.

We have calculated the sensitivity of dipole-dipole and \nWenner-Schlumberger configurations to small deformations (dh) of the surface in the \ndirection perpendicular to the slope using the R2 finite-element forward modelling \ncode (Binley & Kemna 2005). The results were calculated for |dh\/a| = 0.005, 0.01, \n0.02 & 0.05 and indicate that the sensitivity can be expressed as Sh = |d\u03c1a\/\u03c1a| \/ |dh\/a|. \nTable 4 gives Sh as a function of n, and comparison with Table 2 shows that the \nsensitivity to perpendicular deformation is approximately an order-of-magnitude less \nthan the sensitivity to longitudinal displacement. \nHaving calculated the effects of electrode movements in a simplified \nanalytical example, we used the same approach to examine the apparent resistivity \nratios from the field measurements using the March 2009 and the baseline data sets. \nFigure 7a shows, in red, the measured apparent resistivity ratios and, in blue, the \nratios calculated from the measured longitudinal movements (assuming no changes in \nthe resistivity of the homogeneous half-space). Although the real resistivity \ndistribution is clearly strongly heterogeneous, by using the ratio of the data the effects \nof the static heterogeneity are suppressed. This is similar to dividing by reference data \nto suppress 3D effects in 2D imaging (Ramirez & Daily 2001) and artefacts due to \nerrors in electrode positions and boundary conditions (Gasulla et al. 2005). It also \nagrees with the findings of Zhou & Dahlin (2003) that electrode position errors cause \nsimilar effects in homogeneous and inhomogeneous models. The fit between the \nmeasured and calculated ratios is already good, with an RMS misfit error of 3.77 %. \nBy including the measured transverse movements (Figure 7b) the fit is improved \nslightly to 3.69 %, with an obvious improvement only visible for the largest calculated \nra on the n = 1 curve. Although static heterogeneity (i.e. spatial variation in subsurface \nresistivity) is suppressed by using ratio data, temporal variations in resistivity will \naffect the apparent resistivity ratio. To help account for these changes, as in Figure 6d, \nwe include a bulk resistivity ratio r that varies as a function of the depth-of-\ninvestigation (i.e. effectively with the n-level for a fixed dipole length a). This \nassumes that the time-lapse changes in resistivity are caused primarily by changes in \ntemperature and saturation, and that these changes depend predominantly on depth. \nNote that changes in the resistivity distribution caused by mass movement may lead to \nspatially localised apparent resistivity changes that will not be well described by this \nterm. But this is not expected to have a large effect in this case since the rate of lobe \nmovement is quite slow (typically several decimetres per year). The use of a ratio \nterm is appropriate here since resistivity is approximately proportional to saturation \n(Archie 1942) and inversely proportional to temperature (Hayley et al. 2007). The \nratios were estimated simply by inspection of the measured and predicted data, and \nwere found to be 1.00, 1.02, 1.03 and 1.03 for n = 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. They are \nclose to unity since the saturation and temperature conditions would have been similar \nin March 2009 to the baseline conditions in March 2008. In Figure 7c these resistivity \nratios have been applied in addition to the measured movements. This has improved \nthe RMS misfit to 2.62 %. It is clear from Figure 7a - c that the greatest effect on the \napparent resistivity ratios is caused by the longitudinal electrode movements, followed \nby the depth-dependent changes in the subsurface resistivity. The effect of transverse \nmovements is, apart for a small number of n = 1 data, effectively negligible. By using \nthe measured longitudinal electrode positions in the resistivity inversion, the \nsubsurface image is significantly improved (as shown in Figure 7d and normalised to \nthe baseline in Figure 7e). Comparison with Figure 4a and Figure 4b shows that the \nanomalous resistivity structures have been removed, and the RMS misfit of the \nresistivity inversion has improved to 1.02 %, the same as for the baseline model. Note \nthat the depth-dependent resistivity ratios are not used in the resistivity inversion; \ntheir purpose is only to improve the fit between the modelled and observed resistivity \nratios by accounting, albeit in an approximate fashion, for changes caused by \nsubsurface resistivity variations rather than by electrode movements. \nThe analysis of Figure 7 suggests that it should be possible to recover the \nlongitudinal electrode offsets from time-lapse resistivity data by fitting the observed \napparent resistivity ratios to those calculated for a homogeneous half-space. But the \ndata were obtained under similar conditions to the baseline and so represent a nearly \nideal case. It is important to examine how well or otherwise the calculated ra fit the \ndata when saturation and temperature conditions differ from the baseline. Figure 8 \npresents an analysis of the August 2009 data using the same approach. The calculated \nra (blue lines) are identical to those for March 2009 since it is assumed that no \nmovement occurred between these times (as noted earlier, movement of the lobe \ntypically occurs in January and February). The observed ra (red lines) are \nconsiderably \u201cnoisier\u201d than those in Figure 7, although this is likely to be due to \nchanges in the resistivity distribution of the landslide as well as the observed increase \nin random noise (see Table 1). Despite less ideal conditions, the August ra data show \nsimilar behaviour to the March data; the RMS misfit values are higher but the \nmeasured longitudinal movements seem to account for the gross features in the \nobserved ra values (Figure 8a). As in Figure 7, the fit improves slightly with the \ncorrection of the transverse offsets (Figure 8b), but is better still with the inclusion of \nestimated depth-dependent resistivity ratios (r = 0.89, 0.93, 0.96, 0.98 for n = 1, 2, 3 \nand 4 respectively, see Figure 8c). Again, correcting the longitudinal electrode \npositions removed the anomalies in the resistivity image, and reduced the RMS misfit \nof the resistivity inversion to, in this case, 1.07 % (see Figure 8d and Figure 8e). The \nnormalised resistivity image (Figure 8e) reveals a distinct layering. We speculate that \nthe resistivity reduction in the top ~3 m of the image is due to the increased \nsubsurface temperature compared to the baseline. Only 5.5 mm rain fell at the site in \nthe week preceding the collection of the August 2009 data; therefore it seems unlikely \nthat increased saturation would account for these resistivity decreases relative to the \nbaseline conditions. It seems more probable that the saturation has decreased \nthroughout the top ~10 m of the subsurface, leading to the observed increase in \nresistivity in the lower layer, and that this has been masked by the greater effect of \nincreased temperature in the top ~3 m. Some supporting evidence for this \ninterpretation is provided by ongoing temperature monitoring at the site, which \nindicates an average thermal diffusivity in the range 0.03 - 0.06 m2\/day, giving an \naverage characteristic depth of penetration of 1.9 - 2.7 m for surface temperature \nfluctuations. \nElectrode position inversion \nThe preceding analysis shows that uncorrected movements in the longitudinal \npositions of electrodes on a linear ERT array cause significant artefacts in apparent \nresistivity data and the resulting inverted images. If these position offsets are \nmeasured and corrected, then the artefacts are removed and images of similar quality \nto those of the baseline can be recovered. Even in the presence of noise, the results \nsuggest that a model based on longitudinal electrode movements on a homogeneous \nhalf-space combined with depth-dependent time-lapse resistivity changes can be used \nto predict the observed artefacts. By using the ratios of the observed data to the \nbaseline, the effects of subsurface heterogeneity seem to be sufficiently suppressed to \nmake inverting for the longitudinal electrode offsets a possibility using this simplified \nanalytical model. \nTo test this hypothesis we attempt to find the vectors of longitudinal electrode \nmovements m and depth-dependent resistivity ratios r that minimise the merit \nfunction  \n jj\njj\nj\ni\ni mmmef )(2 \u2211\u2211\u2211 ++= \u03b8\u03b2\u03b1 , (4) \nwhere e = ra,pre \u2013 ra,obs is the data discrepancy vector between the predicted apparent \nresistivity ratios calculated from eq. 1 and the observed ratios, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the weights \nof the model constraints, and \u03b8 is the Heaviside step function. The first term of the \nmerit function imposes an L2-norm constraint on the data discrepancy, the second \nterm is an L1-norm damping constraint on the length of the movement vector, and the \nthird term applies a negativity constraint to the elements of the movement vector (the \nelectrodes should move towards the origin, i.e. downhill). Note that the elements of r \nare allowed to vary freely without constraint. We minimise f using the \nFindMinimum[] function in the Mathematica computational algebra software. This is \na Quasi-Newton method which uses the BFGS algorithm to update the approximated \nHessian matrix (Press et al. 1992). Convergence was judged to have occurred when \nthe relative change in f between subsequent iterations was <1 %. \nThe results of this approach for the March 2009 data are shown in Figure 9a. \nThe red line shows the measured longitudinal electrode movements, the blue line \nshows the movements predicted by minimising f. To obtain these results we used \nweights of \u03b1 = 0.06 m-1 and \u03b2 = 0.32 m-1 in eq. 4. The fit to the data is shown in \nFigure 9b for a = 4.75 m and n = 2 - 4. The n = 1 data is shown for completeness, but \nthey were not used in the prediction of the longitudinal movements or the calculation \nof the RMS misfit since their sensitivity to transverse movements, although weak, \ncannot be neglected. The fitted depth-dependent resistivity ratios are also shown and \nagree very closely with those estimated by inspection in Figure 7c (the ratio for n = 1 \nis taken from the Figure 7 estimate). The fit between the observed and predicted data \nis very good, with an RMS misfit of 1.82 %. The predicted electrode positions are all \nwithin 0.2 m (or 4 % of the unit electrode spacing) of their measured positions. Using \nthe predicted electrode positions in the resistivity inversion produces an RMS misfit \nof 1.06 %, very close to that achieved using the measured positions. The resulting \nresistivity image (Figure 9c and Figure 9d) is also extremely similar (cf. Figure 7d and \nFigure 7e) and does not exhibit the anomalies that were present before the electrode \npositions were corrected (Figure 4a and Figure 4c). \nFor the August 2009 data, levels of random noise and heterogeneous \nresistivity changes were greater, therefore the model constraint weighting factors were \nincreased to \u03b1 = 0.08 m-1 and \u03b2 = 0.40 m-1. Despite this, the electrode positions could \nstill be predicted to approximately the same level of accuracy. The predicted \nmovements are shown in Figure 10a, and again are all within 0.2 m of the measured \npositions, although the number of larger discrepancies (in the range 0.1 - 0.2 m) has \nincreased from 3 for the March data to 6. The fit to the data (as shown in Figure 10b) \nis reasonable, with an RMS misfit of 6.54 %. Once again, the fitted depth-dependent \nresistivity ratios agree very closely with those in Figure 8c, and the inverted resistivity \nimage (Figure 10c and Figure 10d) is very similar to that for the measured electrode \npositions (Figure 8d and Figure 8e). While the RMS misfit of the resistivity inversion \nis slightly higher (1.15 % cf. 1.07 %), it is better than that of the uncorrected inversion \n(at 1.46 %). \n \n \nDiscussion \nThe above example has demonstrated that electrode movements on an active \nlandslide can be recovered by inverting time-lapse geoelectrical data using a \nsimplified analytical forward model. Whilst the primary intention of this study is as a \nproof-of-concept, we also aim to discuss some aspects of the general applicability of \nthe method, namely the sensitivity of the inversion to the regularisation constraints; \nthe applicability of the method in regions of stronger heterogeneity; and its \napplicability in regions of more rugged topography. \n The model damping (\u03b1) and negativity (\u03b2) constraints were chosen to \nminimise the misfit between the inverted and the measured longitudinal movements. \nGenerally, however, the measured positions would not be available when predicting \nelectrode movements using this technique. Therefore it is desirable to assess the \nsensitivity of the results to the regularisation parameters. Figure 11 shows the mean \nmisfit between the inverted and measured electrode movements as functions of \u03b1 and \n\u03b2 for the March 2009 data. The values highlighted by the vertical arrows \n(\u03b1 = 0.06 m-1, \u03b2 = 0.32 m-1) were used to generate Figure 9, but similar results would \nhave been obtained for 0.01 m-1 < \u03b1 < 0.10 m-1 and for \u03b2 > 0.30 m-1. The insets in \nFigure 11a show that if the inversion is underdamped (e.g. \u03b1 = 0 m-1) then large \nmovements are accurately recovered, but nearly all electrodes with small or no \nmovement are assigned spurious displacements of between 0.1 and 0.6 m. Conversely \nif the inversion is overdamped (e.g. \u03b1 = 0.25 m-1) then the electrodes that do not move \nare correctly predicted, but the movements of the others are underestimated by up to \n0.6 m. In Figure 11b, the insets show that if the negativity constraint is too small, then \nspurious upslope movements can be predicted. Larger values of \u03b2 produce results very \nsimilar to those in Figure 9a, which is to be expected since none of the electrodes \nactually moved upslope. However, it is possible in some cases that local upslope \nmovement could actually occur (e.g. as a result of a rotational slip). It is likely that \nthese displacements could be predicted by the inversion, since small upslope \ndisplacements can result even when \u03b2 > 0 (e.g. see electrode 8 in Figure 9a). But the \nrange of \u03b2 that produced good predictions would have an upper limit in such cases, \nand it might be worth experimenting with different regularisation schemes instead \n(e.g. smoothness constraints (Loke et al. 2003) on adjacent electrode displacements). \nThe position inversion method depends on approximating the movement-\ninduced changes in apparent resistivity ratios using a model with a homogeneous \nsubsurface. In the preceding case history, the moving electrodes are being carried by a \nlobe of mudstone slipping over underlying sandstone with a resistivity contrast of \napproximately an order-of-magnitude. The thickness of the lobe in the resistivity \nimages is ~5 m, which is similar to the maximum median depth-of-investigation of \nthe data used to invert the electrode positions (for a = 4.75 m and n = 4, the median \ndepth-of-investigation z1,4 = 5.8 m). To investigate the effects of stronger static \nheterogeneity on resistivity ratio data and on the resulting position inversion, we \nconsider two simple models: a vertically faulted half-space (Figure 12a) and a \nvertically faulted half-space with a covering layer of thickness z1,4 (Figure 12b). The \napparent resistivities were calculated using the method of images for the faulted half-\nspace (Patella 1997) and using the Res2DMod forward modelling software for the \ncovered faulted half-space. The electrode spacing a = 4.5 m was chosen to simplify \nthe model discretisation; this spacing giving a corresponding z1,4 = 5.5 m. In each \ncase, the electrode immediately to the right of the fault at x = 2.25 m was moved in \nthe -x direction i) closer to the fault (red arrows and ratio curves) and ii) across the \nfault (blue arrows and ratio curves). The ratio curves are shown in Figure 12 for a = \n4.5 m, n = 1 only, but all the data for n = 1 - 4 were used to invert for the electrode \nposition. In each case the method was tested for resistivity contrasts of \u03c12\/\u03c11 = 0.001, \n0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000, although for clarity the data are only shown for \ncontrasts of 0.1, 1, and 10. The results of the position inversion for the displaced \nelectrode in the two models are shown in Table 5 and Table 6. The results suggest that \nthe method can be applied with good success (i.e. recovering electrode positions to \nwithin 4 % of the unit electrode spacing) providing either i) that the movement does \nnot cause the electrode to cross a resistivity boundary or ii) that the electrode is \ncarried across a boundary by a moving layer of thickness comparable to the depth-of-\ninvestigation of the data used in the inversion. If either of these conditions is met, then \nthese results suggest that the position inversion will work well even in the presence of \nresistivity contrasts of up to three orders-of-magnitude. \n \nTable 5.

This should be valid providing \nthat the topography is locally close to flat, i.e. undulating by <10\u00b0 (Tsourlos et al. \n1999) on the length scale of the electrode configurations being used. However \nlandslides often exhibit more rugged topography than this. In these cases it is likely \nthat significant errors in the inverted positions would be caused by using the flat half-\nspace model. It might be possible to use a finite element modelling code to include the \neffects of topography, e.g. R2 (Binley & Kemna 2005). However, if the topography \nchanges significantly during the movement period, it is unlikely that this could be \nrecovered as well as the longitudinal displacements. This is because, as already shown \nin Table 4, the data are approximately an order-of-magnitude less sensitive to \ndeformations of the surface than to longitudinal displacements. \nConclusion \nIf permanently deployed electrodes move from their assumed positions while \nthey are being used for time-lapse resistivity monitoring, then artefacts will be \nintroduced in the resulting images, degrading the quality of the fit to the data and \nobscuring the structure of the subsurface resistivity images. Therefore it is important \nto update the positions before the data is inverted to produce the image. Manual or \nautomated resurveying of the electrodes locations for every time-lapse dataset would \nbe costly and\/or technically challenging.  \nHowever, we have shown that it is possible to extract the electrode movements \nfrom the geoelectrical data and then use these to correct their positions in the \nresistivity inversion. Under certain circumstances (e.g. if the electrodes are being \ncarried progressively downslope by a body of displaced material such as in a slide, \nspread or flow) using the ratios of the apparent resistivities to those of the baseline \ndata can suppress the effects of static heterogeneities in the resistivity distribution. \nThis allows the effects of electrode movement to be calculated from an analytical \nhomogeneous half-space model. In these situations, the apparent resistivity ratios do \nnot depend strongly on the resistivity distribution (only on the time-lapse changes \nbetween distributions), and the analytical model can be used to invert for the electrode \nposition offsets by making simplifying assumptions about the nature of the time-lapse \nchanges in the resistivity distribution (in this case that they are a function of depth \nonly). \nWe demonstrated this technique using data from a permanently installed linear \nelectrode array running up an active lobe of a landslide. Two different time-lapse \ndatasets were used that had a common baseline. The first set was acquired a year after \nthe baseline under similar temperature and saturation conditions and represented a \nclose-to-ideal case. The second set was taken 5 months later, and showed greater and \nmore heterogeneous time-lapse variations in the recorded apparent resistivity data. \nHowever, in both cases the simple position inversion routine was able to predict the \nelectrode displacements to within 0.2 m, or 4 % of the electrode spacing. Using the \npredicted positions in the subsequent resistivity inversion improved the fit to the data \nand removed the image artefacts that had been caused by assuming that the electrodes \nhad not moved. \nWe aim to use this technique to track the electrode movements during the next \nperiod of landslide movement. Our research is ongoing into using series of time-lapse \ndatasets to constrain the evolution of the position offsets to be a smooth function of \ntime. While the research presented here addresses movements parallel to the linear \narray, we will also investigate using measurements in the perpendicular direction to \ndetermine transverse offsets as well. This would enable us to use similar techniques to \ntrack the electrode movements in 2D, allowing for position-corrected 4D (i.e. 3D + \ntime-lapse) inversion. The ultimate goal of this research is to combine the resistivity \nand position inversions into one algorithm, similar to those under development for use \nin medical electrical impedance tomography. This would enable the simultaneous \nreconstruction of the resistivity image and electrode positions in more complex \nsituations with stronger transient heterogeneity and more rugged topography. \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like extend our sincerest gratitude to Mr. and Mrs. Gibson (the \nlandowners) for their involvement and cooperation in this research.
