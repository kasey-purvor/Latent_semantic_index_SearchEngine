In order to predict future ice-sheet behaviour, modellers require long-term 23 \nrecords of ice-sheet melting to constrain and build confidence in their simulations. 24 \nHere, we present detailed marine geological and radiocarbon data along three palaeo-25 \nice stream tributary troughs in the western ASE to establish vital information on the 26 \ntiming of deglaciation of the WAIS since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We 27 \nhave undertaken multi-proxy analyses of the cores (core description, shear strength, x-28 \nradiographs, magnetic susceptibility, wet bulk density, total organic carbon\/nitrogen, 29 \ncarbonate content and clay mineral analyses) in order to: (1) characterise the 30 \nsedimentological facies and depositional environments; and (2) identify the horizon(s) 31 \nin each core that would yield the most reliable age for deglaciation. In accordance 32 \nwith previous studies we identify three key facies, which offer the most reliable 33 \nstratigraphies for dating deglaciation by recording the transition from a grounded ice 34 \nsheet to open marine environments. These facies are: i) subglacial, ii) proximal 35 \ngrounding-line, and iii) seasonal open-marine. In addition, we incorporate ages from 36 \nother facies (e.g., glaciomarine diamictons deposited at some distance from the 37 \ngrounding line, such as glaciogenic debris flows and iceberg rafted diamictons and 38 \nturbates) into our deglacial model. In total, we have dated 78 samples (mainly the acid 39 \ninsoluble organic (AIO) fraction, but also calcareous foraminifers), which include 63 40 \ndowncore and 15 surface samples. Through careful sample selection prior to dating, 41 \nwe have established a robust deglacial chronology for this sector of the WAIS. Our 42 \ndata show that deglaciation of the western ASE was probably underway as early as 43 \n3 \n \n22,351 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP), reaching the mid-shelf by 13,837 44 \ncal yr BP and the inner shelf to within c.10-12 km of the present ice shelf front 45 \nbetween 12,618 and 10,072 cal yr BP. The deglacial steps in the western ASE broadly 46 \ncoincide with the rapid rises in sea-level associated with global meltwater pulses 1a 47 \nand 1b, although  given the potential dating uncertainty, additional, more precise ages 48 \nare required before these findings can be fully substantiated. Finally, we show that the 49 \nrate of ice-sheet retreat increased across the deep (up to1,600 m) basins of the inner 50 \nshelf, highlighting the importance of reverse slope and pinning points in accelerated 51 \nphases of  deglaciation.  52 \n 53 \nKeywords: West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), 54 \nAmundsen Sea, dating, deglaciation, reverse slope.  55 \n56 \n4 \n \n1. Introduction 57 \n One of the largest uncertainties in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 58 \nChange\u2019s projection of future sea level is the uncertain behaviour of the largely 59 \nmarine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The Amundsen Sea Embayment 60 \n(ASE) drains approximately 35% of the WAIS and is one of the most rapidly 61 \nchanging parts of the cryosphere. Over the last two decades surface elevations of 62 \nglaciers in the ASE (e.g., Pine Island and Thwaites) have decreased by 3.5 to 5.5 ma-1 63 \n(Shepherd et al. 2004; Scott et al., 2009) leading some to suggest that complete 64 \ncollapse of the ice in these catchments is possible on human time-scales (Katz and 65 \nWorster, 2010). If this were to happen, it would raise global eustatic sea level by an 66 \nestimated 1.2-1.5 m (Vaughan, 2008).  67 \n Ice sheets have long reaction timescales due to the complex interplay between 68 \nisostasy, thermo-mechanical coupling and advection of ice with different rheological 69 \nproperties in the basal shear layers (Bentley, 2009). Thus, in the context of recent 70 \nrapid thinning and grounding line retreat of glaciers in the Amundsen Sea, it is still 71 \nunclear whether these changes are: (1) a rapid phase of a long-term, stepwise retreat 72 \nthat began with warming and\/or sea-level rise shortly after the LGM; or (2) a response 73 \nto a recent atmospheric\/oceanic forcing. To determine which of these scenarios is 74 \ncorrect accurate reconstructions of the post-LGM deglacial history are necessary. 75 \nAccurate information on past ice sheet configurations and deglacial \u2018trajectories\u2019 will 76 \nhelp improve our understanding of contemporary ice sheet behaviour and thus 77 \nconstrain numerical ice sheet models which aim to predict future sea-level change. 78 \n In this paper we establish a detailed deglacial history for the western ASE, 79 \nencompassing the Dotson and Getz Ice shelves (Fig. 1), using direct evidence on the 80 \ntiming of retreat from sedimentological and radiocarbon data, analysed in 31 sediment 81 \n5 \n \ncores. In addition, we compare the timing of post-LGM ice-sheet retreat in this region 82 \nto the regional picture of deglaciation along the Pacific margin of the WAIS, discuss 83 \nthe style and rate of deglaciation, and comment on whether ice from the western ASE 84 \ncontributed to global meltwater pulses (mwps).  85 \n 86 \n2. Study area and previous work 87 \n 88 \n The Getz Ice Shelf is over 480 km long and 32 to 96 km wide, bordering the 89 \nHobbs and Bakutis Coasts of Marie Byrd Land between McDonald Heights (west of 90 \nour map) and Martin Peninsula (Fig. 1). The Dotson Ice Shelf is c. 48 km wide 91 \nbetween Martin and Bear Peninsulas on the coast of Marie Byrd Land. Both ice 92 \nshelves have thinned dramatically during the past two decades with recorded elevation 93 \nchanges of -36 \u00b1 2 cm year\n-1\n and -17 \u00b1 6 cm year\n-1\n from 1992 to 2001 (Shepherd et al. 94 \n2004). In addition the Kohler Glacier, buttressed by the Dotson Ice Shelf, is thinning 95 \nrapidly and its flow speed accelerated by 10-50% between 1996 and 2005 (Rignot, 96 \n2006). These rates, particularly those of the Dotson Ice Shelf, are comparable to the 97 \nthinning and flow acceleration of Pine Island Glacier (PIG), and thus suggest common 98 \nforcing(s). Rapid ice-shelf thinning in the ASE has been linked to basal melting by 99 \nwarm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) which is thought to have resulted in a 100 \nreduction in buttressing force, ice flow acceleration, dynamic thinning and grounding 101 \nline (GL) retreat (Shepherd et al., 2004; Payne et al., 2004; 2007; Walker et al., 2007; 102 \nThoma et al., 2008; Jenkins et al., 2010).  103 \n In the western ASE, three c. 1,000-1,600 m deep tributary troughs extend 104 \nseawards from the modern ice shelf fronts, eventually merging into a single cross 105 \nshelf trough, approximately 65 km wide and 600 m deep (Fig. 1; western ASE palaeo 106 \n6 \n \nice stream trough) (Larter et al., 2007, 2009; Nitsche et al., 2007; Graham et al., 107 \n2009). The mid-shelf trough then shallows seaward, but continues NW to the shelf 108 \nedge where its axis, between 118\u2013119\u00b0 W, is still deeper than 500 m (Fig. 1). The 109 \neasternmost tributary trough extends from beneath the Dotson Ice Shelf and the other 110 \ntwo extend from below parts of the Getz Ice Shelf either side of Wright Island. 111 \nHereafter we refer to them as the Dotson, Getz A and Getz B tributary troughs, in 112 \norder from east to west (Fig. 1). Elongated subglacial bedforms imaged close to the 113 \nmodern ice fronts in the Dotson and Getz A tributary troughs develop into mega-scale 114 \nglacial lineations (MSGL) further offshore. The tributary troughs then merge into the 115 \nmain Dotson-Getz Trough (Larter et al., 2009; Graham et al., 2009). Similarly 116 \nelongated bedforms, within 40 km of the Getz B ice front, suggest that streaming flow 117 \nalso occurred at least in the NE part of that tributary trough. The pattern of bedforms 118 \nwithin the troughs indicates flow convergence northwards and represents a major 119 \npalaeo-drainage route of the WAIS during the LGM, with grounded ice probably 120 \nextending to the continental shelf edge (Larter et al., 2009; Graham et al., 2009).  121 \n The timing of deglaciation in the ASE remains poorly constrained. Three cores 122 \nrecovered from the inner shelf of Wrigley Gulf, to the west of Siple Island (Getz D 123 \nusing our terminology; Fig. 1) indicate the onset of open-marine sedimentation 124 \noccurred sometime between 14,750 and 15,215 cal yr BP (13,873 and 14,194 \n14\nC yr 125 \nBP; uncorrected age; Anderson et al., 2002). More recently, Hillenbrand et al. (2010a) 126 \nstudied five sediment cores (VC424, 425, PS69\/273, PS69\/274, PS69\/275) collected 127 \nin the western ASE. The cores recovered an almost pure diatomaceous ooze unit 128 \ndirectly above the grounding-line proximal facies. The authors argued that the 129 \ndiatomaceous ooze would be relatively free from contamination from old carbon and 130 \ncorrected the AIO \n14\nC dates by subtracting a standard 1,300 yr marine reservoir 131 \n7 \n \n(MRE) (e.g., Berkman and Forman, 1996). This approach was supported by relative 132 \npalaeointensity (RPI) dating indicating that the inner shelf was ice free sometime 133 \nbefore c.12,000-12,700 cal yr BP (Hillenbrand et al., 2010a).  134 \n The timing of deglaciation in the western ASE is broadly consistent with very 135 \nsparse \n14\nC data from the eastern ASE. On the mid-shelf, west of Burke Island, 136 \ncalcareous foraminifera found in glacial-marine sediment overlying till yielded an age 137 \nof 14,500 \u00b1 3,900 \n14\nC yr BP (corrected age; Lowe and Anderson, 2002. We quote the 138 \ncalibrated age of 17, 450 cal yr BP given in Heroy and Anderson, (2008) but note that 139 \nthe calibrated age could lie between 12,750-22,000 cal yr BP if the full error is used in 140 \nthe calibration). An additional date, from the base of a glaciomarine sequence, which 141 \ndid not recover till, yielded a minimum age of 8,850 \n14\nC yr BP for deglaciation further 142 \ninshore (corrected age; Lowe and Anderson, 2002), although the core site still lies 190 143 \nkm from the modern ice front of PIG. Thus, the sparse \n14\nC data from the ASE suggest 144 \nthat the western mid to inner shelf deglaciated between c. 9,950-17,400 cal yr BP, 145 \nwhile deglaciation of the inner part of Pine Island Bay is still poorly constrained. 146 \n3. Methodological approach 147 \n 148 \n3.1. Sedimentary facies and dating the retreat of grounded ice 149 \n Cores recovered from palaeo ice-stream troughs on the Antarctic continental 150 \nshelf typically yield a three-fold sediment stratigraphy with a largely homogenous 151 \ndiamicton (subglacial facies) at the base overlain by stratified to structureless, sandy 152 \nto gravelly, terrigenous sediments (transitional or deglacial facies), which in turn are 153 \noverlain by bioturbated to homogenous, diatom- or foraminifera-bearing glaciomarine 154 \nmuds (open marine facies) (Domack et al., 1999, 2005; Evans and Pudsey, 2002; 155 \n8 \n \nDowdeswell et al., 2004a; Evans et al., 2005; Heroy and Anderson, 2005; 2007; \u00d3 156 \nCofaigh et al., 2005; Pudsey et al., 2006; Heroy et al., 2008; Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 157 \n2009, 2010b). Typically the subglacial diamicton was deposited by fast flowing ice 158 \nstreams as deformation till, the transitional sediments, which mark the phase of ice lift 159 \noff at the core site, were deposited proximal to the grounding line (GL) and the 160 \nmicrofossil-bearing glaciomarine muds in an open-marine (hemipelagic) setting 161 \ndirectly following ice retreat. This three-fold stratigraphy represents the most reliable 162 \nsediment sequence for establishing retreat of grounded ice as it records the transition 163 \nfrom subglacial deposition through to open marine conditions (e.g., Heroy and 164 \nAnderson, 2007). However, due to the scarcity of radiocarbon data in Antarctica it is 165 \nsometimes necessary to report dates from other stratigraphies, such as those which 166 \nonly recovered the transitional and open-marine facies, iceberg turbates, winnowed 167 \ncoarse-grained deposits (so-called \u2018residual glaciomarine sediments\u2019), gravity-flow 168 \ndeposits and iceberg-rafted diamictons.  169 \n Unfortunately, Antarctic shelf sediments generally lack calcareous 170 \nforaminifera, which are conventionally used for radiocarbon dating and have well-171 \ndefined reservoir corrections (e.g., Berkman and Forman, 1996). When carbonate 172 \n(micro-)fossils are absent it is necessary to date the \u2018bulk\u2019 or acid insoluble organic 173 \n(AIO) fraction. However, these \u2018bulk\u2019 AIO ages are subject to significant 174 \ncontamination from relict organic matter eroded from the Antarctic continent (Licht et 175 \nal., 1996; Andrews et al., 1999; Ohkouchi and Eglinton, 2006) or re-working of older 176 \nshelf sediments (Domack et al., 1999), which can lead to substantially older 177 \nradiocarbon ages. Despite this problem, several studies have successfully utilized ages 178 \nfrom the AIO fraction to establish deglacial chronologies for the Antarctic shelf (Licht 179 \net al., 1996; 1998; 1999; Domack et al., 1999; Pudsey and Evans, 2001; Licht and 180 \n9 \n \nAndrews, 2002; Heroy and Anderson, 2005; 2008; Mosola and Anderson, 2006; 181 \nMcKay et al., 2008; Hillenbrand et al., 2010a, b).  182 \n An additional complication often relates to which sedimentary unit should be 183 \ndated. Heroy and Anderson (2007) have recently argued that the lowermost 184 \ntransitional facies should be dated rather than the lowermost open marine facies 185 \nbecause a time-lag will exist between lift-off of grounded ice and onset of 186 \nhemipelagic sedimentation. However, like previous authors (e.g., Pudsey and Evans, 187 \n2001; Pudsey et al., 2006), Heroy and Anderson (2007) observed that samples in the 188 \nlowermost transitional facies were significantly older than samples taken from the 189 \ninterface between the transitional and open marine facies. This drastic downcore 190 \nincrease of ages results in a so-called \u201814C dog-leg\u2019 (see Figure 2e in Heroy and 191 \nAnderson, 2007) in age-depth profiles where the abrupt increase in \n14\nC age with depth 192 \nis related to a higher degree of contamination from fossil organic carbon in the 193 \ntransitional unit (Heroy and Anderson, 2007). Hillenbrand et al. (2009, 2010b) found 194 \na similar pattern in the Bellingshausen Sea and suggested that the clay mineral 195 \nassemblage of shelf cores can be used as a detector to help pinpoint the most suitable 196 \nhorizon to date in each core. The authors showed that the lower section of the 197 \ntransitional facies often contains a clay mineralogical assemblage more similar to the 198 \nsubglacial facies, implying most contamination, whilst the upper section of the 199 \ntransitional facies contains a clay mineral assemblage similar to the open-marine 200 \nfacies. On the basis of this relationship Hillenbrand et al. (2010b) argued that the most 201 \nreliable deglaciation ages are obtained from the upper part of the transitional 202 \nfacies\/lower part of the open marine facies because it reflects the decreasing influx of 203 \n(potentially contaminated) sediments delivered to the grounding line and increasing 204 \ninfluence of modern (open-marine) sedimentation.   205 \n10 \n \n 206 \n3.2. Criteria for selecting samples for \n14\nC dating 207 \n 208 \nIn order to achieve the most reliable deglacial chronology for the western ASE 209 \nwe implemented a rigorous dating strategy whereby detailed sedimentological, 210 \nphysical properties and geochemical data were used to select the horizon in each core 211 \nthat would yield the most reliable AIO \n14\nC deglacial age (i.e., a date free from major 212 \ncontamination with old carbon while still representing the passing of the grounding 213 \nline across the core site). In cores with a three-fold stratigraphy, samples for dating 214 \nice-sheet retreat were taken directly above the contact between the transitional and the 215 \nopen marine facies (Fig. 2a, Suppl. Fig. 1). This boundary was identified using 216 \ndistinct changes in grain-size (typically a down-core change from gravel\/coarse sand 217 \nto silt and clay to gravel\/coarse sand), changes in magnetic susceptibility (either a 218 \ndowncore increase or decrease, probably depending on changes in magnetic 219 \nprovenance), a down-core increase in shear strength and changes in the clay mineral 220 \nassemblage. In cores that recovered open-marine sediment directly overlying the 221 \nsubglacial facies, the samples for \n14\nC dating the ice-sheet retreat were taken from the 222 \nlower part of the open-marine facies (Suppl. Fig. 1). 223 \nWe consider our approach to provide the most reliable age for deglaciation, 224 \nwhen using conventional AMS \n14\nC dates from the AIO fraction. Furthermore, whilst 225 \nthe transitional facies spans the time period between the first stage of deglaciation 226 \n(i.e., lift-off of grounding ice) and the onset of seasonal open-marine sedimentation, 227 \nwe argue that unless there is clear evidence for the presence of a large ice shelf (see 228 \nKilfeather et al., in press) the calving margin will closely follow retreat of the GL. As 229 \nsuch, the date we provide for deglaciation is a minimum age for GL retreat, but one 230 \n11 \n \nthat we consider to be robust and relatively free from contamination. Thus, in the 231 \ncontext of this paper, we use the term deglaciation to refer to the onset of 232 \nglaciomarine influence (here defined as the recognition of the first influence by 233 \nglaciomarine processes after the passage of the GL over the core site). Additional 234 \nsamples for \n14\nC dating were taken either side of this \u2018optimum horizon\u2019 to investigate 235 \npresence of significant age reversals\/changes in sedimentation and to ensure that 236 \nsamples for dating the deglaciation were taken from above any pronounced \n14\nC dog-237 \nleg. We also routinely dated the AIO of surface sediments at each core site to correct 238 \ndowncore AIO ages, and also dated calcareous (micro-)fossils wherever this was 239 \npossible. 240 \n 241 \n4. Material and methods 242 \n 243 \n4.1. Sample collection and laboratory analyses 244 \n 245 \n Geophysical data and sediment cores were collected during cruise JR141 of 246 \nthe RRS James Clark Ross (JCR) and ANT-XXIII\/4 of RV Polarstern (PS) in 2006. 247 \nSwath bathymetry data were obtained on JCR using a Kongsberg EM120 system with 248 \n191 beams in the 11.25\u201312.75 kHz range and on PS, using an Atlas Hydrosweep DS-2 249 \nsystem with 59 beams at 15.5 kHz. Detailed swath bathymetry data are published in 250 \nmore detail elsewhere (Nitsche et al., 2007; Larter et al., 2007; 2009; Graham et al., 251 \n2009). Sediment cores were collected along transects within the three tributary 252 \ntroughs and the main trough (Fig. 1a & b) using a vibrocorer (VC) and gravity corer 253 \n(GC), whilst surface sediments were collected using a box corer (BC) and giant box 254 \ncorer (GBC), respectively (Table 1). Surface samples, representing the sediment-255 \n12 \n \nwater interface, were sampled directly from the box together with up to three sub-256 \ncores. Physical properties (magnetic susceptibility, wet bulk density (WBD), and P-257 \nwave velocity) were measured on whole cores using GEOTEK multisensor core 258 \nloggers (MSCL) at the British Ocean Sediment Core Research Facility (BOSCORF, 259 \nSouthampton, UK) and at the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI, Bremerhaven, 260 \nGermany). Magnetic susceptibility was additionally measured on the split halves of 261 \nthe cores using a BARTINGTON MS2F point sensor at the British Antarctic Survey 262 \n(BAS, Cambridge, UK) and at AWI. X-radiographs were obtained on whole core 263 \nsections of the VCs and 1 cm-thick sediment slabs sampled from the GCs to 264 \ninvestigate sedimentary structures. Shear strength was measured every 10-20 cm on 265 \nthe split cores using a hand held shear vane. Individual sediment sub-samples (1 cm-266 \nthick slices) were then taken every 5-20 cm and used to determine water content, 267 \ngrain size, total carbon (TC), organic carbon (Corg) and total nitrogen (Ntot). Corg and 268 \nNtot were determined using element analyzers LECO CS-125, CS-400 and CNS-2000 269 \nat AWI and Vario EL III Elemental analyser at the Institute for Geophysics and 270 \nGeology (University of Leipzig, Germany) and used to calculate Corg\/Ntot ratios. 271 \nAnalytical precision was 1% for the TC measurements and 3% for the Corg 272 \nmeasurements. We also calculated calcium carbonate (CaCO3) contents from the TC 273 \nand Corg data.  For grain size analyses sediment samples were disaggregated in 274 \ndeionised H2O and then passed through a 2 mm and a 63 m sieve. The <63 m 275 \nfraction was then treated to 20% hydrogen peroxide solution and 10% Hydrochloric 276 \nacid, to remove Corg and CaCO3 and dispersed in 2 ml of Sodium Hexametaphosphate 277 \n((NaPO3)6). The grain-size distribution of the <63 m fraction was determined using a 278 \nMALVERN microplus 5100 mastersizer at BAS, a Laser Granulometer LS230 279 \nequipped with a fluid module and PIDS (Polarisation Intensity Differential Scatter) 280 \n13 \n \nattachment at the Department of Geography (University of Durham, UK) and a 281 \nMicrometrics SediGraph 5100 at the Department of Geology (University of Troms\u00f8, 282 \nNorway). The proportions of the sand, silt, and clay fractions (< 2 mm) were 283 \ndetermined on a weight basis.  284 \n An aliquot of the \u22642 \u03bcm fraction was used to determine the relative contents of 285 \nthe clay minerals smectite, illite, chlorite and kaolinite in core and surface samples 286 \nusing an automated powder diffractometer system Rigaku MiniFlex with CoK\u03b1 287 \nradiation (30 kV, 15 mA) at the Institute for Geophysics and Geology (University of 288 \nLeipzig). The clay mineral identification and quantification followed the standard X-289 \nray diffraction methods described by Ehrmann et al. (1992) and Petschick et al. 290 \n(1996), and as utilised in Ehrmann et al. (in review). For supplementary data see 291 \nhttp:\/\/doi.pangaea.de\/XYZ. 292 \n 293 \n4.2. \n14\nC Dating, correction and calibration 294 \n 295 \n AMS \n14\nC dating was carried out at the NERC Radiocarbon Laboratory 296 \n(Environment) in East Kilbride (UK). Where present, we dated calcareous material (c. 297 \n10 mg), mainly planktonic foraminifera tests of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma 298 \nsinistral and benthic foraminifera tests picked from 1-2 cm thick sediment slices, 299 \nbecause these \n14\nC dates provide the most reliable radiocarbon ages (e.g. Domack et 300 \nal., 2005; Heroy & Anderson, 2007; Rosenheim et al., 2008). In total we dated 15 301 \nsurface (AIO=13, foraminifera=2) and 63 (AIO=53, foraminifera=10) downcore 302 \nsamples. In line with previous studies (e.g., Andrews et al., 1999; Licht et al., 1998, 303 \n1999; Domack et al., 1999; Pudsey and Evans, 2001; Heroy and Anderson, 2005; 304 \n2008; Mosola and Anderson, 2006; Pudsey et al., 2006; Hillenbrand et al., 2010b) all 305 \n14 \n \ndowncore AIO ages were corrected by subtracting the uncorrected core-top age 306 \nobtained from the BC surface sample. This assumes that the core top age represents 307 \nmodern deposition and is supported by \n210\nPb data from core PS69\/275-2, which 308 \nindicates modern deposition (Hillenbrand et al., 2010a). In six cores (VC424, VC425, 309 \nVC427, PS69\/273, PS69\/274, PS69\/275), we dated relatively pure diatomaceous ooze 310 \nsamples. As noted above (section 2), we corrected all diatom ooze ages using the 311 \nstandard Antarctic MRE correction of 1,300 years (see Hillenbrand et al., 2010a, for 312 \nfurther discussion).  313 \nOnly two surface samples (BC431, BC435) and three vibrocores (VC419, 314 \nVC436 and VC430) contained sufficient carbonate material for dating. For the surface 315 \nsamples it was possible to pick mono-specific N. pachyderma sin. tests, whilst the 316 \ndowncore samples comprised mixed planktonic and benthic species. These samples 317 \nwere corrected by subtracting a 1,300-year MRE (Berkman et al., 1998; Berkman and 318 \nForman, 1996; Harkness and Gordon, 1992; cf. Anderson et al., 2002).  319 \nBoth the AIO core top and MRE corrections were applied prior to calibration 320 \n(see Table 2). All dates were calibrated to calendar years before present (BP; relative 321 \nto AD 1950) with the CALIB v5.1beta program using the Marine04 age model 322 \n(Stuiver et al., 2005). We report all ages as either \n14\nC yr or calibrated years BP (cal yr 323 \nBP) and note, where appropriate, if previously published ages are corrected, 324 \nuncorrected or calibrated.  325 \n 326 \n5. Results and interpretation 327 \n 328 \n5.1. Facies analysis  329 \n 330 \n15 \n \n Sediment facies were determined on the basis of visual core descriptions, x-331 \nradiographs, shear strength, physical properties (MS, WBD), grain-size, Corg and 332 \nCaCO3 contents, Corg\/Ntot ratios and clay mineral assemblages (see Suppl. Table 1). 333 \nThese data were used to: (a) establish the depositional environment; and (b) select the 334 \noptimum horizon in each core to date the deglaciation. We only display the 335 \nsmectite\/chlorite ratios, as this ratio proved to be the most sensitive indicator of 336 \nchanges in sedimentary facies. Representative core logs and data are presented for 337 \neach facies in Figure 2, with the corresponding data for all other cores given in 338 \nSupplementary Figure 1. Our interpretations of sediment facies are consistent with 339 \npreviously published data from the Antarctic shelf (e.g. Licht et al., 1996, 1998, 1999; 340 \nDomack et al., 1998, 1999; Anderson, 1999; Pudsey and Evans, 2001; Evans and 341 \nPudsey, 2002; Evans et al., 2005; Heroy and Anderson, 2005; Hillenbrand et al., 342 \n2005, 2009, 2010b; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2009). 343 \n 344 \n5.2. Facies 1, 2 and 3 345 \n 346 \n Cores VC408, VC415, VC418, VC424, VC425, VC427, PS69\/273-2 and 347 \nPS69\/275-1 contained three distinct facies (Facies 1-3) interpreted as open marine, 348 \ntransitional (i.e. grounding-line proximal) and subglacial, respectively, whilst cores 349 \nPS69\/274-1 and PS69\/267-1 contained only the transitional and the open marine 350 \nfacies (Facies 1-2) and cores VC417, VC428, PS69\/280-1, PS69\/265-3 and PS69\/259-351 \n1 contained the open-marine facies directly overlying the subglacial facies (Facies 3 352 \nand 1) (Fig. 2 and Suppl. Fig. 1). These facies sequences represent the most reliable 353 \nstratigraphic successions for dating glacial retreat (c.f., Heroy and Anderson, 2007).  354 \n 355 \n16 \n \nFacies 3 typically comprises a massive, matrix supported diamicton with subangular 356 \nto subrounded cobbles in a muddy matrix. Generally, the diamicton is grey to olive 357 \ngrey (predominantly 5Y 5\/2, but also 5Y 5\/1 gray to 5Y 4\/1 dark gray) (Fig. 2). Shear 358 \nstrength ranges from 5\u201324 kPa and generally decreases towards the top of the 359 \ndiamicton. MS (200-1500 x10\n-5\n SI Units) and WBD (>1.6 g\/ccm) are usually high, 360 \nwhilst water content is low (<35 wt.%). Grain-size composition is variable, but is 361 \ngenerally characterised by 45-70% mud, 20-40% sand and 5-15% gravel, although 362 \nsome cores (e.g., PS69\/280-1) contain up to 20% gravel. Corg content is generally low 363 \n(c. 0.2 wt.%), whilst Corg\/Ntot values are higher (>20) than in Facies 2 and 1. CaCO3 364 \ncontent shows no consistent trend with values between 1 and 3 wt.%. In some cores, 365 \nCaCO3 content is highest in the diamicton (e.g., PS69\/275-1).    366 \n We interpret Facies 3 as a deformation or \u2018soft till\u2019 deposited beneath fast 367 \nflowing (streaming) ice. Facies 3 was mainly sampled in cores on the inner and mid-368 \nshelf, coinciding with elongated glacial lineations, indicative of ice-streaming on a 369 \nmobile and deformable bed (\u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2007; King et al., 2009). 370 \n 371 \nFacies 2 represents a transitional unit from Facies 3 to Facies 1 (Fig. 2, Suppl. Fig. 1). 372 \nMS values, WBD and shear strength all decrease up-core, whilst water content 373 \nincreases. The 63\u03bcm-2 mm and >2 mm fractions also generally decrease up-core 374 \ntogether with the Corg\/Ntot ratios, while the Corg contents generally increase. In cores 375 \nVC415 and PS69\/273-2 the Corg values are lowest in the transitional facies. Generally, 376 \nFacies 2 is similar in colour to Facies 3 (predominantly 5Y 5\/2 to 5Y 4\/1) whilst x-377 \nradiographs often show parallel to sub-parallel stratification and random to horizontal 378 \npebble orientation. Smear slides occasionally show a relative up-core increase in 379 \nfragments of diatoms.  380 \n17 \n \n Facies 2 was probably deposited in a glaciomarine environment proximal to 381 \nthe grounding line of the ice stream, subsequent to its retreat from the core site (e.g., 382 \nDomack et al., 1998, 1999; Licht et al., 1999; Evans and Pudsey, 2002; Hillenbrand et 383 \nal., 2005, 2010b). The unit varies in thickness from c. 15 to 40 cm, but is absent in 384 \nsome cores.  385 \n 386 \nFacies 1. The uppermost stratigraphic unit consists of an olive grey (5Y 4\/2) to olive 387 \n(5Y 4\/3) massive, bioturbated diatomaceous to diatom-bearing mud, which ranges in 388 \nthickness from 3 (VC425) to 226 cm (VC427). Planktonic foraminifera constitute the 389 \nbiogenic components in Facies 1 on the outer shelf (VC430, VC436) and were also 390 \nobserved at the core top of VC428 on the mid-shelf (Fig. 2, Suppl. Fig. 1). Shear 391 \nstrength and MS values are typically low (1-4 kPa and 10-80 x 10\n-5\n SI Units 392 \nrespectively), whilst the <2 mm grain-size fraction is characterised by high clay and 393 \nsilt and low sand concentrations. Water and Corg content are high in Facies 1. 394 \nPredominantly subangular to subrounded pebbles are occasionally present and 395 \ninterpreted as iceberg-rafted debris (IRD). Facies 1 is either structureless or shows 396 \nburrows and mottles caused by bioturbation. The contact between the Facies 2 and 397 \nFacies 1 ranges from sharp to gradational.  398 \n Facies 1 reflects deposition in a seasonally open marine setting, distal from the 399 \nice front. This interpretation is based on the presence of diatoms and\/or planktonic 400 \nforaminifera and bioturbation and is supported by the low concentration of coarse-401 \ngrained material, high water content and low shear strength. In an earlier publication, 402 \nwe argued that the thick diatomaceous ooze that directly overlies the ice-proximal 403 \nFacies 2 at some sites (PS69\/273-2, PS69\/274-1, PS69\/275-1, VC424, VC425 and 404 \nVC427) represented a period of enhanced productivity immediately after deglaciation, 405 \n18 \n \nin a relatively warm, well-stratified ocean (Hillenbrand et al., 2010a). We also argued 406 \nthat \n14\nC ages from this unit would be relatively free from contamination with fossil 407 \ncarbon because of the apparent lack of terrigenous material and therefore most 408 \nsuitable for dating.  409 \n 410 \n5.3. Other facies types included in our deglacial model 411 \n 412 \n Due to the dearth of \n14\nC data from this area, we also incorporate some ages 413 \nfrom other sedimentary facies sequences, such as iceberg turbates\/iceberg-rafted 414 \ndiamictons (Facies 4) and proglacial gravity-flow deposits (Facies 5), into our 415 \ndeglacial chronology. 416 \n 417 \nFacies 4: Cores VC436 VC430, VC436, PS69\/283-5\/6 recovered homogenous, grey 418 \n(predominantly 5Y 4\/1, but also 2.5Y 4\/2 and 5Y 4\/2) diamictons with uniformly high 419 \nMS and WBD values, and low water content (<30 wt.% and commonly 18-20 wt.%). 420 \nShear strength values are generally high (up to 35 kPa), but can vary significantly 421 \ndowncore. Corg contents are generally low (<0.25 wt.%), whilst the CaCO3 content 422 \nvaries between 1 and 3 wt.%. VC430 and VC436 occur on the outer shelf (<450 m 423 \nwater depth), whilst PS69\/283-5\/6 is located on a shallower trough flank on the 424 \nmiddle shelf, in areas where multibeam bathymetry data show iceberg scours (see Fig. 425 \n11 in Graham et al., 2009). Based on their sedimentological characteristics and 426 \nlocation within areas of iceberg scours, we interpret these deposits as a sequence of 427 \niceberg-rafted diamictons and iceberg turbates deposited after grounded ice had 428 \nretreated. The high and variable shear strength most likely results from pervasive 429 \nscouring and mixing of the seafloor sediments by icebergs. 430 \n19 \n \n In cores VC436 and VC430 calcareous foraminifera occur in low abundances 431 \nthroughout the diamictons and at several depths, enough planktonic and\/or benthic 432 \nforaminifers were present to obtain \n14\nC ages (Table 2). The presence of foraminifera 433 \nin significant abundances, particularly of planktonic N. pachyderma sin. tests implies 434 \nthat the outer shelf was free of grounded ice at the time of their deposition, although 435 \nwe cannot rule out that advection beneath an ice shelf played a role (cf. Hemer et al., 436 \n2007).  437 \n In core VC436, all but one of the six downcore \n14\nC ages occur in stratigraphic 438 \norder (Fig. 2c) with an age of 14,975 \u00b1 46 \n14\nC yr BP (16,266 cal yr BP) at 540 cmbsf 439 \ncore depth. However, a significantly older age (20,115 \n14\nC yr BP, 22,351 cal yr BP) at 440 \n60 cmbsf, supported by replicate analysis of material from 61 cmbsf (18,080 \n14\nC yr 441 \nBP, 19,945 cal yr BP) suggests some sediment re-working and re-distribution has 442 \ntaken place. We suggest that the age-reversal at 60-61 cmbsf depth results from the 443 \nreworking of nearby sediments by an iceberg that ploughed older material over the 444 \nsite sometime after 9,941 \n14\nC yr BP (9,731 cal yr BP). Generally however, turbation 445 \nby icebergs must have been relatively shallow to preserve discrete foraminiferal layers 446 \nin stratigraphic order.   447 \n We also interpret similar deposits recovered at core sites PS69\/283-5\/6, which 448 \nare also found in areas of iceberg scours (Fig. 11 in Graham et al., 2009), as iceberg-449 \nrafted diamictons\/iceberg turbates. However, PS69\/283-5\/6 did not include calcareous 450 \nmicro-fossils so is not included in our deglacial model.  451 \n 452 \nFacies 5 (VC419, VC422, VC411): Core VC419 recovered a sequence of 453 \nhomogenous, purely terrigenous silty-clay beds (predominantly 5Y 5\/1 grey) 454 \ncharacterised by low MS values and high water content intercalated with six discrete, 455 \n6-70 cm thick, terrigenous sand and\/or gravel layers (predominantly 5Y 4\/1 dark grey) 456 \n20 \n \nwith high MS values and low water content (Smith et al., 2009; Suppl. Fig. 1e). The 457 \ntwo sandy gravel layers have sharp basal boundaries, are normally graded and capped 458 \nby finely laminated sand and silt layers. The top 30 cm of the upper sandy gravel layer 459 \nis strongly bioturbated. The upper three sand layers are also slightly bioturbated, have 460 \nsharp basal boundaries and consist of well-sorted muddy sand. Shear strength is 461 \nrelatively low (c. 5 kPa) throughout the sequence, but is slightly higher at its base (c. 462 \n10 kPa). Arenaceous benthic and calcareous benthic and planktonic foraminifera 463 \noccur within the basal sandy gravel layer between 384-380 cmbsf, which provided an 464 \nuncorrected age of 11,237 \u00b1 40 \n14\nC yr BP (11,432 cal yr BP). 465 \n Core site VC419 occurs in a deep, steep sided subglacial meltwater channel, 466 \nwhich has probably been formed over several glacial cycles (Smith et al., 2009). In an 467 \nearlier study, Smith et al. (2009), suggested that the sedimentological properties of the 468 \ncoarse-grained layers in core VC419, such as sharp basal boundaries with normal 469 \ngrading, are typical of gravitational down-slope transport (e.g., Lowe, 1982; Bartek 470 \nand Anderson, 1991). Accordingly, we interpreted the layers as grain-flow deposits 471 \nand coarse-grained turbidites, which were probably re-deposited from topographic 472 \nhighs, forming the flanks of the channel, since the LGM. Our interpretation is also 473 \nsupported by the presence of calcareous foraminifera in the sandy gravel layers of 474 \ncore VC419. In situ surface sediments from the deep inner shelf basins in the 475 \nAmundsen Sea and the nearby Bellingshausen Sea are virtually carbonate-free 476 \n(Hillenbrand et al., 2003) as a result of their location below the carbonate 477 \ncompensation depth (CCD), which is typically shallower than 500 m on the West 478 \nAntarctic shelf (e.g., Li et al., 2000). The water depth of site VC419 (806 m) is well 479 \nbelow the CCD, so the occurrence of calcareous foraminifera in the basal sandy 480 \ngravel layer implies reworking and rapid burial of sediments from shallower water 481 \n21 \n \ndepths, probably by grain flows and\/or turbidity currents deposited subsequent to 482 \ndeglaciation.  483 \n Terrigenous, massive and sometimes stratified muds, sands and gravels were 484 \nalso recovered at two other sites (VC422 and VC411; Fig. 2d and Suppl. Fig 1b). 485 \nHowever, in contrast to VC419, these deposits did not contain calcareous (micro-486 \n)fossils and are therefore not included in our deglacial model.  487 \n 488 \n5.5. \n14\nC Data 489 \n 490 \n All uncorrected, corrected and calibrated radiocarbon ages are presented in 491 \nTable 2. Uncorrected surface sample ages range from 1,693 to 2,768 \n14\nC yr BP 492 \n(foraminifera) and 3,262 to 6,429 \n14\nC yr BP (AIO) and reflect the well-documented 493 \nproblems associated with sediment re-working\/winnowing and introduction of old, 494 \nfossil carbon, respectively (Fig. 3). Our AIO-derived surface ages are similar to those 495 \npreviously reported from the Ross Sea that yielded AIO ages in the range of 2,000\u2013496 \n5,000 \n14\nC yr BP (Licht et al., 1996; Andrews et al., 1999; Domack et al., 1999; Licht 497 \nand Andrews, 2002; Mosola and Anderson, 2006) and from the southern 498 \nBellingshausen Sea that yielded AIO ages from 3,800-6,400 \n14\nC yr BP (Hillenbrand et 499 \nal., 2010b). Spatially, there appears to be no consistent pattern in the distribution of 500 \nsurface ages in the western ASE, although surface ages in the Dotson trough appear to 501 \nbe slightly older, perhaps reflecting a greater proportion of old carbon-bearing rocks 502 \nbeneath its catchment (Fig. 3; Ehrmann et al., in review).  503 \n Downcore (uncorrected \n14\nC) ages range from 4,919 to 20,115 \n14\nC yr BP for 504 \ncarbonate and 5,945 \n14\nC yr BP to 37,223 \n14\nC yr BP for the AIO fraction (Table 2). 505 \nWhen corrected and calibrated, all downcore ages, with the exception of dates from 506 \n22 \n \ncores VC424 and VC436 (discussed in more detail below), occur in stratigraphic 507 \norder (within 1 \u03c3 error).  508 \n 509 \n6. Interpretation of \n14\nC ages 510 \n 511 \n6.1. Timing of deglaciation in the western ASE 512 \n 513 \n Detailed mapping of subglacial bedforms in the western ASE indicate that 514 \nstreaming ice flowed along the three tributary troughs (Dotson, Getz A and B) 515 \nconverging into one large cross shelf trough around 73\u00b030\u2019S (Fig. 1) that extended to 516 \nthe shelf break (see Graham et al. (2009) for additional information). Highly elongate 517 \nMSGL north of 73\u00b030\u2019S imply flow acceleration in the zone of ice convergence 518 \nbetween the three troughs, which also coincides with the transition between acoustic 519 \nbasement and dipping sedimentary strata (Larter et al., 2009; Graham et al., 2009). 520 \nBelow we present minimum ages for the timing of grounded ice retreat along the main 521 \npalaeo ice stream and the three feeder trough(s).  522 \n  Figure 4a shows the calibrated ages plotted against distance from the modern-523 \nday grounding line (GL) for the western ASE (GL inferred from the MODIS dataset; 524 \nBohlander and Scambos, 2007). For cores recovered from the zone of ice-flow 525 \nconvergence between tributary troughs (e.g., VC424; Fig. 1) and those on the outer 526 \nshelf (e.g., VC430, VC436) a mean distance relative to the GL of all relevant tributary 527 \ntroughs was calculated.  Our most \u2018reliable\u2019 deglacial 14C ages, represented by closed 528 \ncircles in Figure 4, were obtained from (1) the lowermost part of the seasonal open-529 \nmarine sediments of Facies 1 (most sites), (2) the gravity flow deposit of Facies 5 530 \n(VC419), or (3) the iceberg-related deposits of Facies 4 (VC430, VC436). All these 531 \n23 \n \nages plot above any apparent \n14\nC dog-leg in the age-depth plots (Fig. 2 and Suppl. 532 \nFig. 1.). Ages that do not meet these criteria are excluded from our deglacial 533 \nchronology, irrespective of how they fit with nearby ages. Furthermore, for all AIO 534 \ndeglacial ages, the corresponding samples were taken from sediments with relatively 535 \nlow Corg\/Ntot ratios (<20), i.e. comparable to the Corg\/Ntot ratios in the surface 536 \nsediments. This approach ensures that the samples used for dating the deglaciation i) 537 \ndid not contain significantly more fossil organic carbon than those used for the 538 \ndowncore correction of the \n14\nC AIO dates and ii) were dominated by marine organic 539 \nmatter, which typically has Corg\/Ntot ratios between 4 and 10, but may reach higher 540 \nratios (\u226430) in Antarctic shelf environments (see references in Hillenbrand et al., 541 \n2010b).  542 \n Open circles of the same colour in Figure 4a relate to all other ages obtained 543 \nfrom each core. These ages were mainly used to assess downcore consistency in \n14\nC 544 \nages (age reversals etc.) and assess the presence of apparent \n14\nC dog legs (see Fig. 2 545 \nand Suppl. Fig. 1). Figure 4b only shows our most reliable deglaciation ages, 546 \nillustrating a consistent pattern (within error) of ice-sheet retreat from the shelf. 547 \nWhere more than one age from a core meets our criteria, only the oldest age is shown 548 \nas a filled circle in Fig. 4b. 549 \n At sites PS69\/274-1, PS69\/275-1 and VC424, we also used the RPI records of 550 \nthe cores to identify the \n14\nC date providing the most reliable deglaciation age (see 551 \nHillenbrand et al., 2010a). On this basis, we reject ages from VC424 (276.5 cmbsf), 552 \nVC425 (221 cm) and PS69\/275-1 (228.5 cmbsf) as being too old (see Hillenbrand et 553 \nal. 2010a for further discussion). We also note that the x-radiograph from core VC425 554 \nindicates that the upper part of the diatomaceous ooze layer sampled for dating (221 555 \ncmbsf) shows evidence of mixing with terrigenous material (visible as 556 \n24 \n \nsand\/terrigenous grains in the x-radiograph), whereas all other samples appear pure. 557 \nThis could explain why the age from VC425, as well as the basal ooze samples from 558 \nVC424 and PS69\/275-1 discussed above, are slightly older when compared to all 559 \nother diatom ooze-derived ages.  We therefore reject the ooze age from VC425 from 560 \nour preferred deglacial model (Fig. 5).  561 \n Figure 4 shows that the deglaciation of the outer shelf is constrained by ages 562 \nfrom core VC436, with the oldest age from VC436 occurring out of stratigraphic 563 \norder (60 cmbsf; Fig. 2c). Whilst this age clearly indicates some degree of sediment 564 \nreworking, probably by iceberg ploughing, the presence of both planktonic and 565 \nbenthic foraminifera at this depth implies that their deposition after the grounding-line 566 \nhad retreated. Thus, in the absence of additional data, we use this age (22,350 cal yr 567 \nBP) as a minimum age for deglaciation of the outer shelf. Two foraminiferal ages 568 \nfrom core site VC430 indicate ice-sheet retreat before c.11,000 cal yr BP (Table 2, 569 \nFig. 3).  570 \n Grounded ice had retreated along the main cross shelf trough (Fig. 1) to the 571 \nmid-shelf south of 73\u00b0S by 13,837 cal yr BP (site VC428). From this location, the 572 \ninner shelf appears to have deglaciated rapidly to positions close to the modern ice 573 \nshelf fronts by 11,432 cal yr BP (VC419) to 10,072 cal yr BP (VC415) in the Dotson 574 \nand Getz-A troughs respectively and perhaps as early as 12,618 cal yr BP (PS69\/274-575 \n1) in the Getz B trough. In detail, we see that the timing and style of deglaciation is 576 \nconsistent between all three troughs (Fig. 5a-d), but subtle differences do exist. Except 577 \nfor one foraminiferal age from core VC419, all \n14\nC ages from the middle to inner 578 \nshelf are derived from the AIO.   579 \n For each profile we present our favoured deglacial model (solid line), but 580 \nretain all \u2018reliable\u2019 ages that meet our criteria to create a deglacial \u2018envelope\u2019 for the 581 \n25 \n \nwestern ASE mid-inner shelf (Fig. 5d). This provides an upper and lower estimate for 582 \nthe minimum age for ice retreat (Table 3).  583 \n 584 \n6.1.1. Dotson trough 585 \n 586 \n Along the Dotson tributary trough, ice had retreated to within 12 km of the 587 \npresent ice shelf by 11,432 cal yr BP (Fig. 5a), with cores VC428, PS69\/267-1, 588 \nPS69\/280-1, VC419 and VC417 showing a consistent pattern of retreat. In contrast, 589 \nthe age from core site VC408 indicates the onset of open marine influence occurred 590 \napproximately 600 years later than at the more southerly core site of PS69\/280-1 (Fig. 591 \n5a). Given our potential dating uncertainty (both laboratory error and \n14\nC correction 592 \nand calibration), we retain this age as a minimum for deglaciation on this part of the 593 \nshelf (Table 3), but omit it from our favoured deglacial profile. Core VC418, located 594 \nbetween core sites PS69\/280-1 and VC419 (Fig. 4a), also records a much later date 595 \nfor the onset of open marine influence, but we omit this date from our deglacial 596 \nmodel, because no surface AIO age is available for this station. To correct the 597 \ndowncore age from VC418 we used the surface age from nearby core VC408, and this 598 \nappears to have resulted in an anomalously young age.  599 \n Multibeam data from the Dotson tributary trough show a series of grounding 600 \nzone wedges (GZW) (see Graham et al., 2009) formed on the inner shelf between core 601 \nsites PS69\/267-1 and PS69PS69\/280-1. Glacial lineations terminating at the crest of 602 \nthe GZWs indicate that they formed during a phase of ice margin retreat (Graham et 603 \nal., 2009), when the grounding line stabilised, probably on local pinning points. 604 \nAlthough we have insufficient data to determine the precise timing and duration of 605 \ndeglacial still-stands, cores to the north and south place a constraint c.1,650 years on 606 \n26 \n \nthe maximum duration of GZW formation, which is consistent with the time span 607 \nestimated for the deposition of a GZW on the western Antarctic Peninsula shelf 608 \n(Larter and Vanneste, 1995). However, based on a simple sediment flux calculation, 609 \nGraham et al. (2010) argued that the GZW in the eastern ASE could have formed 610 \nwithin 120 years, so the stillstands during deglaciation could be relatively short-lived, 611 \nrelating to effective sediment delivery during a punctuated but otherwise rapid 612 \ndeglaciation. 613 \n   614 \n6.1.2. Getz A Trough 615 \n 616 \n The deglaciation of Getz A trough is constrained by \n14\nC ages from five cores 617 \n(Fig. 5b). Three of these cores (VC424, VC425 and VC427) contained an almost pure 618 \ndiatomaceous ooze unit directly above the ice proximal facies (Facies 2). In an earlier 619 \npaper, we argued that the relatively low content of terrigenous detritus in this 620 \ndiatomaceous ooze (also recovered from the Getz B trough) offered the possibility to 621 \nobtain downcore ages that were largely unaffected by contamination from terrigenous 622 \nfossil carbon (Hillenbrand et al., 2010a). Indeed, the calibrated ages from cores 623 \nVC424 and VC427, using a standard MRE correction (1,300 years) for the 624 \ndiatomaceous ooze samples and a surface age correction for all other samples, show a 625 \nconsistent downcore trend (within error; e.g., Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figure 1). 626 \n Figure 5b shows that deglaciation of the inner shelf, to within 10 km of the 627 \nmodern ice shelf front, was complete by 10,072 cal yr BP (core site VC415; Fig. 5b). 628 \nThis is c. 1,000-2,000 years later than similar positions in the Dotson and Getz B 629 \ntroughs. It is possible that locally grounded ice (perhaps from Wright Island) or an ice 630 \nshelf persisted on this part of the inner shelf after grounded ice had retreated from the 631 \n27 \n \nmain tributary trough. We emphasise that we use this date (10,072 cal yr BP) as our 632 \nminimum age of deglaciation of this part of the shelf.  633 \n 634 \n6.1.3. Getz B Trough 635 \n 636 \n The pattern and timing of deglaciation of the Getz B tributary trough is 637 \nbroadly consistent with that of the Getz A tributary trough (Fig. 5c). Minimum ages 638 \nfor deglaciation are provided by diatomaceous ooze ages from four cores, which also 639 \nincludes core VC424. Reconstructed palaeo flow lines (based on subglacial bedforms) 640 \nindicate that ice from the Getz A and Getz B troughs converged to the north east of 641 \nWright Island (Fig. 1b and Graham et al., 2009), so it is appropriate to use VC424 in 642 \nboth Getz A and B tributary trough deglacial profiles. Although there is some scatter 643 \nin the ages from the inner shelf basin, our favoured deglacial model indicates that ice 644 \nretreated almost instantaneously from the middle to inner shelf (i.e. between VC424 645 \nand PS69\/274-1). Ice had retreated to within 10 km of the modern ice shelf front by 646 \n12,618 cal yr BP (PS69\/274-1), which is 1,000-2,000 years earlier than the 647 \ndeglaciation of the inner shelf in both the Getz A and Dotson troughs.  648 \n In summary, deglaciation of the western ASE was underway as early as 649 \n22,351 cal yr BP, and certainly before 16,267 cal yr BP reaching the mid-shelf by 650 \n13,837 cal yr BP and the inner shelf to within c.10-12 km of the present ice shelf front 651 \nbetween 12,618 and 10,072 cal yr BP (Fig. 5d). We note that the spread of ages for 652 \ndeglaciation of the mid to inner shelf is largely consistent, which we have used to 653 \nprovide an upper and lower estimate for the minimum age for ice retreat (Fig. 5d and 654 \nTable. 3). However, in the remainder of the discussion, we only refer to age profiles 655 \nshown in Figures 5a-c. 656 \n28 \n \n 657 \n7. Discussion 658 \n 659 \n7.1. Deglaciation of the WAIS along the Pacific margin 660 \n 661 \n Limited data from the eastern ASE (i.e., Pine Island Glacier Trough; Fig. 1, 662 \ne.g. Graham et al., 2010) suggest that the deglaciation of the middle shelf began 663 \nsometime around c. 17,400 cal yr BP (calibrated age given in Heroy and Anderson, 664 \n2007) with a minimum age for deglaciation of the middle to inner shelf around 9,948 665 \ncal yr BP (10,150 \u00b1 370 \n14\nC yr BP uncorrected age; Lowe and Anderson, 2002). 666 \nFurther to the west in the Getz D trough (Wrigley Gulf) open-marine condition were 667 \nestablished on the middle to inner shelf between 14,750 to 15,215 cal yr BP 668 \n(Anderson et al., 2002) (Fig. 6).  669 \n In the western Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region, Heroy and Anderson (2007) 670 \nshowed a north-south trend in ice-sheet retreat on the outer shelf, with earlier 671 \ndeglaciation of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (APIS) occurring at 17,340 cal yr BP 672 \nin the Bransfield Basin at its northwestern tip, later deglaciation of outer Anvers 673 \nTrough (located further south) by c.15,000-16,000 cal yr BP and deglaciation of outer 674 \nMarguerite Trough further to the south by c.14,000 cal yr BP (Fig. 1, inset). The inner 675 \nshelf of Marguerite Bay was ice free by c. 9,100 cal yr BP (Heroy and Anderson, 676 \n2007), with seemingly very rapid deglaciation of the outer to middle shelf sectors of 677 \nMarguerite Trough (Kilfeather et al., in press). Recently published data from the 678 \nBellingshausen Sea suggest that the WAIS and APIS there might have retreated much 679 \nearlier than from other parts of the West Antarctic shelf, with deglaciation of the outer 680 \nshelf occurring as early as 30,000 cal yr BP reaching the mid-shelf by 23,600 cal yr 681 \n29 \n \nBP (Hillenbrand et al., 2010b). Deglaciation of the inner shelf areas occurred at 682 \n14,300 cal yr BP in Eltanin Bay and c. 7,200 cal yr BP in the Ronne Entrance 683 \n(Hillenbrand et al., 2010b).  684 \n In the western and central Ross Sea, AIO ages on diatomaceous muds 685 \nconstrain the deglaciation of the outer shelf, south of Coulman Island, to c. 20,000-686 \n14,000 \n14\nC yr BP (corrected age; Bindschadler, 1998; Conway et al., 1999; Domack et 687 \nal., 1999; Anderson et al., 2002; Licht and Andrews, 2002; Licht, 2004; Mosola and 688 \nAnderson, 2006). After c. 16,390 cal yr BP (13,770 \n14\nC yr BP, corrected age; Licht 689 \nand Anderson, 2002) grounded ice retreated southward across the shelf, reaching 690 \nouter Drygalski Trough by c. 13,000 cal yr BP (11,060 \n14\nC years BP, corrected age; 691 \nDomack et al., 1999), Ross Island by c. 11,700 cal yr BP (10,096\n14\nC yr BP, corrected 692 \nage; McKay et al., 2008), with open marine conditions being established north of 693 \nRoss Island at c. 10,000 cal yr BP (8,861 \n14\nC years BP, corrected age; McKay et al. 694 \n2008). According to McKay et al. (2008) the ice shelf has been pinned to Ross Island 695 \nsince then, while the grounding line has continued to retreat towards the Siple Coast.  696 \n Our chronological data from the western ASE is broadly consistent with the 697 \npreviously published data from the eastern ASE and Wrigley Gulf (Anderson et al., 698 \n2002; Lowe and Anderson, 2002), but provides much more detailed constraints on the 699 \ndeglaciation of this sector of the WAIS, particularly on the mid- to inner shelf (Fig. 700 \n6). Specifically, we point to the close agreement between our mainly AIO-based 701 \ndeglacial ages and previously published carbonate deglacial ages for the inner shelf 702 \nsector of the Getz-D system, which cluster around 14,000 cal yr BP (Anderson et al., 703 \n2002) (Fig. 6). The timing of deglaciation of the outer shelf in the western ASE at 704 \n22,351 cal yr BP, is considerably older than initial retreat of the APIS (17,500 cal yr 705 \nBP) but is consistent with the onset of WAIS retreat from the outer shelves of the 706 \n30 \n \nRoss Sea (25,166 cal yr BP; Mosola and Anderson, 2006) and the Bellingshausen Sea 707 \n(30,000 cal yr BP; Hillenbrand et al., 2010b). If correct, the deglacial ages from the 708 \nwestern ASE\/Bellingshausen Sea sector of the WAIS indicate deglaciation was 709 \nunderway earlier than previously thought (cf. Anderson et al., 2002). Generally, 710 \nhowever, the deglaciation of the western ASE precedes the deglaciation of the western 711 \nRoss Sea, which could reflect the proximity of the western Ross Sea to the 712 \nTransantarctic Mountains. It has been previously suggested that the ice on the western 713 \nRoss Sea shelf at the LGM was partly fed by ice flowing from the East Antarctic Ice 714 \nSheet (e.g. Licht et al., 2005), which is thought to have had a different retreat history 715 \nfrom the WAIS (Anderson et al., 2002; Mosola and Anderson, 2006).    716 \n 717 \n7.2. Timing of deglaciation in the western ASE and relation to global meltwater 718 \npulses (mwp) 719 \n 720 \n An Antarctic source for global meltwater pulse (mwp) 1a and 1b has been 721 \nsuggested on the basis of both viscoelastic Earth models (e.g., Bassett et al., 2005; 722 \n2007) and limited geological data from the margins of the WAIS. Heroy and 723 \nAnderson (2007) argued that the timing of deglacial steps of the APIS are roughly 724 \nconcomitant with mwp-1a (14,650-13,700 cal yr BP or 12,500- 11,800 \n14\nC yr BP) and 725 \npossibly 1b (10,350-11,200 cal y BP or 9,200-9,800 \n14\nC BP; Fairbanks et al., 1989), 726 \nbut that the earliest APIS retreat occurred later (c.1000 years) than the 19 ka mwp 727 \n(22,000-19,000 cal yr BP; Yokohama et al., 2000; Fig. 6). In addition, Hillenbrand et 728 \nal. (2010b) suggested that the WAIS and APIS retreat from the southern 729 \nBellingshausen Sea shelf may have contributed to the 19 ka mwp, mwp-1a and mwp-730 \n1b, but was unlikely to have triggered them. In the Ross Sea, McKay et al. (2008) 731 \n31 \n \nargued that retreat of the grounding line from the outer Drygalski Trough to Ross 732 \nIsland is likely to have contributed to mwp-1b (Fig. 6), whilst a Ross Sea contribution 733 \nto mwp-1a has been ruled out by Domack et al. (1999) and Licht (2004) with major 734 \nretreat occurring at c. 11,000 \n14\nC BP. 735 \n The timing of deglacial steps in the western ASE is also coincident with 736 \nmeltwater pulses mwp-1a and mwp-1b (Fig. 6). Specifically, our data indicate a step 737 \nin deglaciation from the mid- to inner-shelf that is roughly in phase with mwp-1a (Fig. 738 \n6), with the majority of rapid retreat shortly after c.14,000 cal yr BP (Fig 6). A minor 739 \nstep in the deglaciation of the inner shelf also occurs shortly before mwp-1b, but 740 \ngenerally the timing of mwp-1b appears to coincide with an overall slowdown and 741 \nstabilisation of ice retreat on the inner shelf in the western ASE. We also tentatively 742 \nnote that the initial rise in sea level associated with the 19 ka mwp, recorded at 22,000 743 \ncal yr BP (Yokohama et al., 2000) immediately follows the onset of deglaciation of 744 \nthe outer shelf in the western ASE(22,351 cal yr BP).   745 \n Despite an apparent correlation between the timing of deglaciation of the 746 \nwestern ASE and global mwps, it remains difficult to fully assess such a relationship 747 \nowing to the potential errors associated with current dating methods. Furthermore, the 748 \noverall contribution of ice in the western ASE, whilst not insignificant, is a relatively 749 \nsmall component of the whole sea-level budget. Bassett et al. (2007) estimated that ice 750 \nfrom the entire ASE has contributed just 0.5 m to eustatic sea level since the LGM, 751 \nwith only 0.15 m contributing to mwp-1a, thus making it a relatively minor 752 \ncomponent of the 15 m of sea level rise associated with the global mwp-1a event.  753 \n Interestingly, the timing of mwp-1a coincides with ice-sheet retreat over the 754 \ndeep inner shelf basins of the Dotson and Getz tributary troughs (Fig. 7). Thus a 755 \npossible mechanism for the rapid phase of ice retreat that we see in these areas might 756 \n32 \n \nbe the combined effect of a sudden sea-level rise associated with mwp-1a, together 757 \nwith instability at the grounding line as the ice sheet retreated across the reverse basal 758 \ngradients on the inner shelf.  759 \n 760 \n7.3. Long-term ice trajectories and rates of grounding line retreat \u2013 the role of deep 761 \ninner shelf basins, pinning points and rising sea-level in rapid deglaciation 762 \n 763 \n The trajectory of ice sheet retreat from the outer to the middle shelf of the ASE 764 \nindicates an average grounding-line retreat of 18 m\/yr (Fig. 7). This value contrasts 765 \nmarkedly with ice-sheet retreat across the mid- to inner-shelf, which appears to have 766 \nreached 140 to 400 m\/yr along the Dotson trough. Retreat rates were not calculated 767 \nfor inner Getz A and B troughs because the dated unit (diatomaceous ooze) from these 768 \ncores is likely to have been deposited synchronously after deglaciation (Hillenbrand et 769 \nal., 2010a) (Fig. 7 and 8).  Our calculated retreat rates for the mid- to inner shelf of the 770 \nDotson trough are comparable to both contemporary (450 m\/yr between 1963-1992 771 \nfor Ice Stream B; Bindschadler and Vornberger, 1998) and palaeo estimates (average 772 \nretreat of 120 m\/yr over the last 7,500 years; Conway et al., 1999) for ice sheet retreat 773 \nin the Ross Sea but are higher than post glacial retreat rates in the Bellingshausen Sea 774 \n(6-44 m\/yr; Hillenbrand et al., 2010b). However, they are considerably lower than the 775 \nrecent, rapid GL retreat of Pine Island Glacier (PIG) (i.e., 1200 \u00b1 300 m\/year between 776 \n1992 and 1996; Rignot, 1998).  777 \n One explanation for the acceleration in GL retreat towards the inner shelf, seen 778 \nin all three troughs could be the along trough bathymetric profiles in the western ASE, 779 \nwhich show a pronounced deepening on the mid-shelf at around 73\u00b0S (i.e., c. 200 km 780 \nfrom modern GL; Fig. 8). Thus, the acceleration of retreat could be related to the 781 \n33 \n \ncrossing of one or more geomorphic and\/or glaciological thresholds. We suggest that 782 \nas the GL retreated into the deeper water on the inner shelf, the calving flux increased 783 \nleading to higher ice velocities and rapid ice sheet thinning and retreat (e.g., Long and 784 \nRoberts, 2003; Benn et al., 2007; Schoof, 2007; Vaughan and Arthern, 2007; Briner et 785 \nal., 2009). Also significant is the timing of ice retreat across the deep inner shelf, 786 \nwhich coincides with the c.15 m of sea-level rise associated with mwp-1a (Fig. 8). 787 \nThus, it is possible the sudden rise in sea-level at c.14,000 cal yr BP contributed to a 788 \nphase of rapid retreat, weakening further the drag between the ice sheet and its bed.  789 \n The reverse gradient and rougher topography of the inner shelf may have also 790 \nexposed the base of the ice sheet to warm CDW, promoting greater melting at the 791 \nbase of the ice sheet\/ice shelf cavity. CDW is currently delivered to the fringing ice 792 \nshelves of the ASE along the deep palaeo ice-stream troughs (e.g., Walker et al., 793 \n2007) (Fig. 1), and has been implicated in the thinning of the floating portion of PIG, 794 \nwhich in turn has been linked to rapid thinning, grounding line retreat and 795 \nacceleration of PIG itself. Jenkins et al. (2010) argued that the recent retreat of PIG, 796 \nwhilst related to basal melting by CDW, is significantly controlled by the shape of the 797 \nglacier bed, and specifically the passing of important pinning points. The authors 798 \ndemonstrated that PIG was grounded on a transverse ridge until the early 1970\u2019s and 799 \nretreat from the ridge has exposed more than 30 km of previously grounded glacier 800 \nbase to melting by CDW. Jenkins et al. (2010) concluded that thinning of the ice shelf 801 \nthrough basal melting is sustained by a positive feedback, whereby the drag between 802 \nthe ridge and ice shelf has been reduced, resulting in enhanced spreading and thinning 803 \nof the ice shelf, and thus allowing more CDW over the ridge and into the ice shelf 804 \ncavity. To maintain balance, the reduced drag is offset by higher tension at the GL, 805 \nwhich leads to faster discharge of ice (Schoof, 2007) and dynamic thinning of the 806 \n34 \n \nglacier. The sudden loss of drag, or pinning might help to explain the very rapid 807 \nretreat rates observed for PIG. 808 \n We suggest a similar scenario for the deglaciation of the western ASE inner 809 \nshelf, with sudden and rapid steps in GL retreat associated with the loss of pinning on 810 \na reverse gradient slope. In the eastern Amundsen Sea too, stepped phases of rapid 811 \ngrounding line retreat have been postulated on the basis of geomorphic evidence 812 \n(Graham et al., 2010). In addition, the contact between the ice sheet and submarine 813 \ntopographic high points or ridges would have been weakened further by enhanced 814 \nbasal melting if CDW gained access to the sub-ice cavity.  815 \n The pace and ultimate extent of such \u2018unstable retreat\u2019 (Schoof, 2007) is 816 \nultimately dependent on the presence of local pinning points. For PIG, the grounding 817 \nline is anticipated to retreat a further 200 km inland until it encounters the next cross 818 \ntrough ridge (see Fig. 2c in Jenkins et al., 2010). Although we cannot fully constrain 819 \nice retreat in the western ASE beyond the present ice shelf margin (the GL occurs 820 \napproximately 65-90 km inland from the ice shelf front), our dataset suggests that the 821 \nice margin stabilised on the inner shelf during the early Holocene (e.g., between core 822 \nsite VC427 and VC415, Getz A trough; Fig. 8). If we assume monotonic retreat of the 823 \nice-sheet from the inner shelf to the current GL, this would equate to a retreat rate of 824 \nc.7 m\/yr, implying a significant slowdown in GL retreat sometime during the early 825 \nHolocene. Presently the Dotson and Getz ice shelves are stabilised by lateral drag 826 \nagainst the flanking coastal peninsulas and islands (Fig. 1), and it is possible that their 827 \nformation, during the early Holocene, played an important role in stabilising the 828 \ncalving front. Although poorly mapped, bathymetric data (Le Brocq et al., 2010) 829 \nindicate that the modern GL in the Dotson-Getz sector coincides with several 830 \n35 \n \ntopographic pinning points c. 350 m below sea-level, which are also likely to have 831 \nhelped stabilise the GL following the rapid retreat along the inner shelf troughs.  832 \n For ice buttressed by the Dotson Ice Shelf (e.g., Kohler Glacier), we speculate 833 \nthat additional phases of rapid retreat are possible as the reverse gradient of the 834 \nDotson A tributary trough, although dissected by several topographic highs (pinning 835 \npoints), appears to extend well into the interior of the WAIS. Thus, similar to what 836 \nhas currently been observed for PIG (e.g., Jenkins et al., 2010), continued basal 837 \nmelting of the Dotson Ice Shelf (e.g., Shepherd et al., 2010) could lead to rapid phases 838 \nof GL retreat as new sub-ice cavities are exposed to warm CDW and greater basal 839 \nmelting. In contrast, the Getz B Ice shelf occupies an east-west trending trough, with 840 \nthe GL pinned to a well-defined topographic high at or close to modern sea level. As a 841 \nresult, it would take much more thinning of the ice sheet for the GL to retreat further 842 \ninland.  843 \n 844 \n7.4 Questions and future work 845 \n 846 \n We have presented an extensive new chronological dataset for the western 847 \nASE, which fills an urgent requirement to provide a deglacial framework for retreat of 848 \nthe WAIS in this sector since the LGM. However, despite good core coverage on the 849 \nmiddle to inner shelf, our deglacial chronology for the middle to outer shelf remains 850 \npoorly constrained. Future expeditions to this area should aim to target the outer shelf, 851 \nparticularly in areas free from iceberg turbation\/ploughmarks. Whilst we are confident 852 \nin our chronological approach and dataset, the framework we have presented should 853 \nbe tested and refined by additional dating methods such as ramped pyrolysis 854 \n(Rosenheim et al., 2008), compound specific dating (Ohkouchi and Eglinton, 2008) 855 \n36 \n \nand additional RPI dating (e.g., Hillenbrand et al., 2010a). In addition, all cores 856 \nshould be closely inspected for carbonate remains, since dating carbonate offers the 857 \nmost accurate method for determining the retreat history of the LGM ice sheet. 858 \nFinally, it is critical that we establish the onset of CDW upwelling onto the Amundsen 859 \nSea shelf, i.e. whether this occurred immediately after the deglaciation of the outer 860 \nshelf or sometime during the Holocene. An answer to this question is significant, 861 \nbecause it will help to constrain the role of basal melting in phases of rapid 862 \ndeglaciation and also clarify how long glaciers and ice shelves in this area have been 863 \nsubject to rapid basal melting and thinning. 864 \n 865 \n8. Conclusion 866 \n 867 \n Detailed analysis of sediment cores from the western ASE, pre-selection of 868 \nsamples for \n14\nC dating, and comparison of the resulting dates with one 869 \nobtained from carbonate samples, diatom oozes and RPI dating demonstrates 870 \nthat reliable ages for deglaciation of LGM ice sheet can be established using 871 \nthe AIO fraction. Our approach results in a minimum age for GL retreat, but 872 \none that we feel is robust and free from significant contamination. Upper and 873 \nlower estimates of the minimum age for deglaciation are given in Table 3. 874 \n Our extensive new 14C dataset indicates that deglaciation of the outer shelf 875 \nbegan sometime prior to 22,351 cal yr BP, reaching the mid-shelf by 13,837 876 \ncal yr BP and the inner shelf to within c.10-12 km of the present ice shelf front 877 \nbetween 12,618 and 10,072 cal yr BP.  878 \n The timing of deglaciation of the mid- to inner shelf is consistent with 879 \npreviously published carbonate ages from the Wrigley Gulf (Getz D area) as 880 \n37 \n \nwell as the timing of ice stream retreat in Marguerite Trough. The ice-sheet 881 \nretreat from the outer shelf in the western ASE appears to precede deglaciation 882 \nof the western Ross Sea, which might suggest that ice retreat in the western 883 \nRoss Sea was more closely coupled to retreat of the EAIS than the WAIS. 884 \n The acceleration in grounding-line retreat from the middle to inner shelf 885 \ncoincides with a landward-increasing reverse gradient along the tributary 886 \ntroughs. Such acceleration of ice retreat could relate to detachment from 887 \npinning points on a reverse gradient slope (e.g., Schoof, 2007). A sudden rise 888 \nin sea level (mwp-1a) at this time might also have contributed to the 889 \nacceleration of GL retreat by further reducing the drag between the ice sheet 890 \nand its bed.  891 \n 892 \n9.
