We examine policy dynamics in both \nthe United States and United Kingdom aimed both at opening up, and closing down, \nthe role of the social sciences in nanotechnologies. We then set out a prospective \nagenda for the social sciences and its potential in the future shaping of \nnanotechnology research and innovation processes. The emergent, undetermined \nnature of nanotechnologies calls for an open, experimental and interdisciplinary \nmodel of social science research. \n \nKeywords \nNanotechnology, governance, upstream public engagement, imaginaries \n \nIntroduction \nSocial science historically developed alongside the new industrial order, which was \nbased upon novel technologies of steam based power, the railways and the factory \nsystem. Marx analysed this new technological society as it unfolded around him in \nmid-nineteenth century Britain. However, during the twentieth century, social science \n                                                 \n1 We would like to thank our colleagues who contributed towards a proposal on nanotechnology and \nsociety \u2013 in particular, Brian Bloomfield, Bob Jessop, Lucy Suchman, Bron Szerszynski, John Urry, \nClaire Waterton and James Wilsdon. This paper emerges out of a collective effort and many of the \nideas expressed emerged out of a highly profitable joint thinking and writing process. \n 3\nhas often struggled to keep pace with new and emerging technologies. It was slow to \nprovide intelligence and reflexive analysis of the implications of personal \nautomobility, the splitting of the atom, and the significance of early computing. \n \nIn this paper we argue that nanotechnology represents an extraordinary opportunity to \nbuild in social science insight from the outset. By thinking of its role in a new way \nand taking the reflexive governance of nanotechnologies as a central concern, social \nscience has novel opportunities to become an actor in these changes, and to provide \ninsights that are simultaneous with scientific, technological and social changes.  \n \nHowever, analysis of all such \u2018technosocial orders\u2019 presents significant challenges to \nexisting ways of doing social science, especially in the outmoded idiom of seeking to \nexamine a categorically social realm as distinct from physical and material elements \n(Latour 2004). Historically, the academic literature has framed technology as \u2018black-\nboxed\u2019 and well-defined, with an independent asocial logic that results in \u2018impacts\u2019 or \n\u2018effects\u2019. Social questions are often narrowly framed as \u2018impacts\u2019 or \u2018risk\u2019 issues, \nplacing the site of social science inquiry firmly \u2018downstream\u2019 of innovation processes \n(for a recent nanotechnology example, see European Commission 2004). However, \nvarious approaches in science and technology studies have shown how technologies \ncannot be black-boxed and separated from sets of constitutive social relations (see \nWynne 1988; Pinch and Bijker 1984; Law and Hassard 1999).  \n \n\u2018Constructive technology assessment\u2019 (Rip, Misa and Schot 1995) and \u2018real time \ntechnology assessment\u2019 (Guston and Sarewitz 2002), represent two approaches that \nproblematise the determinism of black-boxed technology. Both approaches focus on \n 4\nhow \u2018technical\u2019 processes often make implicit upstream assumptions about the social \nuses to which the technology will be put: under what conditions, by which kinds of \nactor, and with what aims (Law and Bijker 1992; Grint and Woolgar 1997). Social \nand political relations, or imagined relations, are \u2018hard-wired\u2019 into technological \ndesigns, and performed by them (Winner 1977). Science and technology theorists \nsuggest that a fundamental characteristic of any technology is its heterogeneous, \nhybrid mix of material, social and discursive relations, its mix of pure and applied \nelements, and its associated and often prescriptive social expectations or assumptions \n(Latour 2004; MacKenzie and Wajcman 1999). The goal of such processes is to \nengage forms of public participation before innovation processes become locked in \u2013 \nin other words at an upstream stage. In this paper we set out and critically engage with \nthe notion of \u2018upstream public engagement\u2019, as a further and potentially useful \naddition to the unfolding academic and policy debate. \n \nSuch a conceptual approach lies in stark contrast to the more limited role of the social \nsciences that tended to characterise its use in the development of biotechnologies. \nDominant approaches, institutionally cemented through programmes aimed at \nunderstanding the ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) surrounding the Human \nGenome project, locked into a framing that assumed the technology as a given, and as \nsuch, assumed the project of ethical and social reflection as one largely reduced to \nconceptualising and evaluating and managing \u2018the impacts\u2019. Through such framing \ncommitments, ELSI programmes lacked any mechanism to affect the innovation \nprocess itself. Relatedly, the birthing of \u2018bioethics\u2019 that arose out of this agenda has \nbeen largely complicit with deficit models of science communication (Wynne 2001; \nHedgecoe & Martin 2003). Indeed, we have argued elsewhere that the framing of the \n 5\nsocial sciences in the development and utilisation of genetically modified (GM) crops \nand foods was such that its mobilisation was often too late and without any real \npurchase on on-going processes of governance (Kearnes et al. forthcoming).  \n \nMore generally, in the domain of biotechnologies, there was little institutionally \nsanctioned space for the social sciences to engage with wider social and political \nquestions about purposes, ownership, control and responsibility (Grove-White et al. \n2000; Wilsdon & Willis 2004). Why these technologies? Why not others? Who needs \nthem, and what human purposes are driving them? Under what conditions will they \nbe enacted; and who sets those conditions? Who is controlling them? Who benefits \nfrom them? Can they be trusted? Drawing on the lessons from GM and other \ncontroversies, nanotechnology reflects an opportunity for the social sciences to \nexplore how governance and regulation can be extended to incorporate a wider set of \ncultural and social, and indeed technical, factors (Kearnes et al. forthcoming). We \nsuggest that unless this challenge is addressed, the latent tensions inherent in the \ntechnological transformation of democratic society are likely to remain unaddressed. \nFar from being a \u2018critical\u2019 project therefore, this is a constructive one, requiring robust \ncollaborative interactions with scientists and technologists.  \n \nSignificantly, there appears to be some institutional recognition of the need for a \nwider role for the social sciences in the development of nanotechnologies, including a \nclear undertaking for novel forms of public dialogue and engagement (see Department \nof Trade and Industry\/ Office of Science and Technology 2005; Royal Society\/RAE \n2004). In this paper we address some of the underlying machinations and rationales at \n 6\nwork for building social science into the development of nanotechnology. These \ninclude: \n \n\u2022 The appeal to social scientists as experts in the study of public opinion and \npolitical mobilisation processes, hence leading to promises that such socially-\nsensitive intelligence may help avoid future disruptive public controversy; \n\u2022 The ability of social science to help shape innovation processes in tune with wider \npublic and consumer attitudes, thus helping governments and corporates \u2018pick-\nwinners\u2019 and \u2018avoid-losers\u2019; \n\u2022 The exploitation of social scientists as (good) public communicators and \ndisseminators of nanoscience and nanotechnologies, often in an outreach capacity, \nthus again helping shape a more informed and arguably less emotive but not \nnecessarily less critical public debate; \n\u2022 The attempt to use social science techniques to open up the \u2018black-box\u2019 of science \nand innovation, so that tacit assumptions shaping its development can be opened \nto wider public scrutiny, to induce greater reflexive awareness amongst scientists \nin their specialist work worlds, with the expected result that innovation processes \nindirectly gain added sensitivity to human needs and aspirations, and thus greater \nresilience and sustainability. \n \nThe distinctions between these framings are of course ambiguous \u2013 indeed, most are \nat play in different ways in multiple contexts. Similarly it is an open question which \nof these framings will come to the fore and dominate. In this sense nanotechnology \nrepresents an opportunity to innovate new and more reflexive relationships between \nthe social sciences and the physical sciences. However, despite this renewed openness \n 7\nto social science input, there is a danger that such input is framed in ways that assume \nthe prima facie beneficence of technology and that would seek to limit the scope for \nsocial science input to disturb core innovation processes. We argue below that in both \nthe United States and United Kingdom there is an emerging dynamic aimed both at \nopening up, and closing down, the role of the social sciences in shaping future \nnanoscience and nano-innovation research agendas and trajectories. We then set out, \nin programmatic form, what a more open-ended agenda for the social sciences of \nnanotechnologies might look like. \n \nThe Public Debate \nIn the past two years, a policy and media debate about nanoscience and \nnanotechnologies has emerged, characterised by competing visions of promise and \nthreat. For their advocates, nanotechnologies are seen to have huge economic and \nsocial potential, ushering in a \u2018new industrial revolution\u2019 that will include \nbreakthroughs in computer efficiency, pharmaceuticals, nerve and tissue repair, \nsurface coatings, catalysts, sensors, materials, telecommunications and pollution \ncontrol (European Commission 2004; House of Commons Science and Technology \nCommittee 2004; Roco & Bainbridge 2001). Worldwide research funding for \nnanosciences and nanotechnologies is increasing rapidly, and is estimated to have \nreached $8.6 billion in 2004 (Lux Research 2004).  \n \nAt the same time, ethical, social and environmental concerns which originated with \ndystopian fears of \u2018grey goo\u2019 (Joy 2000; Drexler 1986) are rapidly taking on a sharper \nfocus around the potential toxicity of nanoparticles and the need for tighter regulation \n(Nature 2003; Royal Society\/Royal Academy of Engineering 2004). NGOs have \n 8\ncriticised the vested interests that lie behind the science, and Prince Charles has raised \nthe spectre of thalidomide in an effort to encourage a more precautionary approach \n(ETC Group 2003; HRH The Prince of Wales 2004). \n \nSuch bipolar characterisations are of course an oversimplification. The questions, \nchallenges and opportunities that surround nanotechnologies will take many forms. \nIndeed, the very definitions and constitutions of nanotechnologies are themselves the \nsubject of lively debate, within the scientific community and beyond (House of \nCommons Science and Technology Committee 2004). \n \nAs conventionally understood, the term \u2018nanotechnology\u2019 refers to the design or \nmanipulation of structures and devices at a scale of 1 to 100 nanometres (or billionths \nof a metre). Yet scale is one characteristic that unites the diverse activities and \napplications commonly referred to in this way. A crucial further issue is the novelty \nand unpredictability of what occurs at this scale. When broken down into such small \nparticles, the properties of materials can change in fundamental ways. Gold and silver \nare good examples. Normally inert and unreactive, at the nanoscale gold acts as a \nhighly effective catalyst, and silver displays bioactive properties (Smith 2004). \n \nWorking at this scale requires a high degree of interdisciplinarity, and nanoscience \nincreasingly extends across a range of fields, from chemistry, physics and biology, to \nmedicine, engineering and computer science. Yet while the term \u2018nanotechnology\u2019 \nmay be relatively new, much of the science behind it is not. Many existing chemical \nprocesses have nanoscale features, and nanotechnologies have been used to create \ncomputer chips for the past 20 years. From a social science perspective, this raises \n 9\nimportant questions about the processes through which such terminologies are being \ndefined, contested and continually adapted in relation to external economic and \npolitical drivers. \n \nGiven the novelty of what becomes possible at the nanoscale, it is perhaps \nunsurprising that nanotechnologies are giving rise to new, and potentially profound, \nsocial questions. These have moved with remarkable rapidity onto the political and \nregulatory agenda in the UK, across Europe the United States and beyond. Additional \ncomplexities flow from the convergence of nanoscale innovations in different \ndomains: notably, the life sciences, cognitive sciences and information technology \n(Nordmann 2004; Wood et al. 2003; European Commission 2004). We now address \nthe policy debate shaping the role of the social sciences in the United States. \n \nThe United States \nIn the US, the context for research into the social and ethical dimensions of new and \nemerging technology has been shaped fundamentally by the institutional support and \ncommitment granted to the ELSI program of the Human Genome Project (Ramsay \n2001). The ELSI program was established to provide: \n \nA new approach to scientific research by identifying, analyzing and addressing \nthe ethical, legal and social implications of human genetics research at the \nsame time that the basic science is being studied. In this way, problem areas \n[would] be identified and solutions developed before scientific information is \nintegrated into health care practice. (National Human Genome Research \nInstitute 2004) \n 10\n \nThe ELSI approach clearly sets the institutional and intellectual context for current \nconsiderations of nanotechnology. As already noted above, however, there remains a \nfundamental tension at the heart of the approach. Although research is clearly \nintended to feed social and ethical insight into science and technology developments \nin \u2018real-time\u2019, it is framed as being able to scrutinise only the impacts or effects of the \ntechnology rather than (as set out above) deeper social and political considerations \nabout driving purposes and visions which may be exercised in shaping knowledge-\nproduction; as well as broader issues about ownership, control and responsibility. \nRather than being a mode through which social science insights may be \u2018built-into\u2019 \ntechnological development, both upstream and in real-time, it is becoming \nincreasingly apparent that the ELSI agenda reduces such scholarship to a downstream \n\u2018bolt-on\u2019. In its focus on impacts and effects the ELSI program assumes the \ninevitability of prevailing and future forms of technology and limits the role of social \nscience to downstream questions. As such, social science scholarship is invoked only \nafter significant commitments are already made and technological pathways have \nbecome locked in, thus without any real purchase on the development of such \ntechnologies.  \n \nThe way that ethical and societal enquiry is positioned in relation to nanotechnology \nin the United States demonstrates the influence of this approach and the tension \ntherein. The National Nanotechnology Initiative report, Leading to the Next Industrial \nRevolution (2000), for example, outlines the role of ethical and societal inquiry in the \nfollowing terms: \n \n 11\nEthical, Legal, Societal Implications and Workforce Education and Training \nefforts will be undertaken to promote a new generation of skilled workers in \nthe multidisciplinary perspectives necessary for rapid progress in \nnanotechnology. The impact nanotechnology has on society from legal, \nethical, social, economic, and workforce preparation perspectives will be \nstudied. The research will help us identify potential problems and teach us \nhow to intervene efficiently in the future on measures that may need to be \ntaken. (pg. 13; see also Bennett and Sarewitz forthcoming) \n \nThe report further outlines how such research will be carried out in real-time, in \nconcert with scientific and technical innovation, and how it will provide early \nevidence of potential social and ethical \u2018problems\u2019 enabling upstream intervention. \nHowever, as with the ELSI program of the Human Genome Project such research is \nalso implicated in the \u2018success\u2019 of the federally funded National Nanotechnology \nInitiative (NNI). That the NNI is, at least rhetorically, to lead to the \u2018next industrial \nrevolution\u2019 is not subjected to ethical or sociological inquiry. And in this particular \nsense, the envisaged role of the social sciences can be seen  as a social lubricant in the \ndrive towards industrial success and commercialisation. This is a position more or less \nenthusiastically embraced by Roco and Bainbridge (2001) in their report on the \nNational Science Foundation sponsored workshop on the \u2018Societal Implications of \nNanoscience and Nanotechnology\u2019. Indeed, in their introduction to the workshop, \nRoco and Bainbridge set out the role of social science research in the following terms: \n \nResearch on societal implications will boost the NNI\u2019s success and help us to \ntake advantage of the new technology sooner, better and with greater \n 12\nconfidence... [and later] Nanotechnology\u2019s effect on society \u2013 legal, ethical, \nsocial, economic, and workforce preparation \u2013 will be studied to help identify \npotential concerns and ways to address them. As the NNI is commencing, \nthere is a rare opportunity to integrate the societal studies and dialogues from \nthe very beginning and to include societal studies as a core part of the NNI \ninvestment strategy. (pgs. 2 & 10, emphases in original) \n \nIn this way, although the social sciences are seen as playing a legitimate and \npotentially integrating role in the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, \nsuch an involvement is still coupled to a relatively unproblematised notion of \n\u2018success\u2019, and to a very downstream vision of the scope for social science which \nexcludes social dimensions of the processes shaping the knowledge and technologies \nthemselves. The positioning of societal and ethical research in this way is therefore \nimbued with the same, unresolved, tension as in the Human Genome Project. Though \nsuch research is to be both funded and supported by central government, and \npositioned in such a way as to promise to influence the trajectory of developments in \nnanotechnology, it is currently unclear whether such research will be able to achieve \nthe necessary distance from projected innovation roadmaps. The ELSI component of \nthe NNI is framed in a way that makes this tension both ambiguous and unresolved.  \n \nSuch unresolved tensions can also be identified in the 2003 21st Century \nNanotechnology Research and Development Act, a largely administrative act designed \nto authorise appropriations for nanoscience, nanoengineering and nanotechnology \nresearch. While specific legislative clauses are written into the act to ensure that \nethical, legal, environmental and societal concerns are addressed during the \n 13\ndevelopment of the technology, it remains unclear as to how and in what ways such \nan integrated agenda is imagined to impinge on the development of the science \nagenda itself. Such tensions are currently being played out in 2005 in related to \nNational Science Foundation proposals for a major $13 million \u2018Center for \nNanotechnology in Society\u2019, not least in relation to the legal stipulation to consider \nthe potential use of nanotechnology in human enhancement.  \n \nTo summarise, even though the role of the social sciences in the US has tended to be \nframed as limited to the exploration of the societal impacts arising from nanoscience \nand nanotechnology there remains significant scope for a wider role due to the \nparallel ambitions for social research to become integrated with innovation processes \nin real time. Such ambiguity has created an opening in the normally \u2018black-boxed\u2019 \nprocesses of technological development and innovation, the effect of which will only \nbecome visible in the coming years.  \n \nThe United Kingdom \nAlthough the social sciences benefited from a well-targeted ESRC funded report on \nthe Social and Economic Challenges of Nanotechnology (Wood et al. 2003), it was \nthe publication in July 2004 of the UK Royal Society\/ Royal Academy of Engineering \nreport on nanotechnologies that signalled the start of a new phase in UK debates on \nnanotechnology and society. Learning from recent experience with biotechnology, the \nRoyal Society highlighted a key role for the social sciences to help provide improved \ninsights into the implications of nanotechnologies and their role in helping facilitate \nmore socially robust technologies.  \n \n 14\nThis move poses significant challenges and opportunities which are only beginning to \nbe conceptualised. Not least on account of the widespread public ambivalence \ntowards science that is manifest in the UK, to what extent is it possible to create \nframeworks of governance that can sustain economically vibrant, socially-legitimate \nand environmentally sustainable technological enterprises? How are individuals and \ninstitutions, confronted with rapid technological change, to imagine new social \npossibilities, and choose among them wisely? And how may all of this pan out for the \npoor, for developing countries, and for the development process generally. A number \nof initiatives in the UK have begun research aimed at developing insights on these \nquestions, so as ultimately to generate more socially-intelligent processes of \nregulation, public dialogue and technology assessment (Department of Trade and \nIndustry\/ Office of Science and Technology 2005; Macnaghten et al. 2003; Wilsdon \n& Willis 2004; Wilsdon et al. 2005).  \n \nThe policy context in the UK, including its particular preoccupations with \u2018public \nengagement\u2019, needs to be situated within a particular historical context. Following a \nseries of controversies \u2013 such as \u2018mad cow\u2019 disease and genetically modified crops \nand foods \u2013 there is growing institutional commitment for new mechanisms of public \ninvolvement in the social and ethical dimensions of science and technology (Better \nRegulation Task Force 2003; House of Lords 2000; Royal Commission of \nEnvironment and Pollution 1998). More recently, policy discussions have started to \nfocus on the need for public engagement to take place \u2018upstream\u2019 in processes of \ninnovation, at a stage when it can influence research decisions, and before entrenched \nor polarised positions emerge (Grove-White et al. 2000; Wilsdon and Willis 2004; \nWynne 2003). For example, the UK government\u2019s new ten-year strategy for science \n 15\nand innovation includes a commitment \u2018to enable [public] debate to take place \n\u201cupstream\u201d in the scientific and technological development process, and not \n\u201cdownstream\u201d where technologies are waiting to be exploited but may be held back \nby public scepticism brought about through poor engagement and dialogue on issues \nof concern\u2019 (HM Treasury\/Department of Trade and Industry\/Department of \nEducation and Skills  2004: 105). This argument has now been adopted in relation to \nnanotechnologies by the Royal Society, the Science Minister Lord Sainsbury, and the \nOffice of Science and Technology (Department of Trade and Industry 2004; \nDepartment of Trade and Industry\/ Office of Science and Technology 2005; Royal \nSociety\/ Royal Academy of Engineering 2004). \n \nThese commitments to \u2018upstream\u2019 public engagement in processes of scientific-\ntechnological innovation are a significant shift in public policy discourse, and raise \nmany unresolved questions for social science as well as for science itself. At what \nstages in R&D processes is it realistic to raise issues of public accountability and \nsocial concern? How and on whose terms should such issues be debated? Are \ndominant institutional discourses of risk, ethics and \u2018social responsibility\u2019 adequate \nfor addressing these issues? Can citizen-consumers exercise constructive influence \nover the pace and direction of technological (and related social) change? How can \nthese questions be reconciled with the need to maintain the independence of science, \nand the economic dynamism of its applications? \n \nOf course, such a portrayal of UK policy-making on nanotechnology and the extended \nrole of the social sciences is only one part of a complex and unfolding set of forces. \nThere is a further and more familiar conservative dynamic at play in which social \n 16\nscience is seen as having a far more limited role in the development of nanoscience \npolicy. Indeed, such a view was reflected in the UK Government response to the \nRoyal Society\/ Royal Academy of Engineering report in which the social sciences \nbarely made a mention, where the language of \u2018upstream\u2019 public engagement failed to \nmake the final draft, and where no new money was offered (HM Government 2005). \nEven the Royal Society declared itself \u2018very disappointed\u2019 (Royal Society 2005)! \n \nIt has been striking to see the rapid official uptake in UK and EU science policy \ncommunities of the idea of upstream public engagement with science; an idea that \nemanated from an extensive academic scholarship in science and technology studies \nand more recently in the writing of key scholars involved in public policy (see Marris \net al. 2001; Wynne 2001 2003; Wilsdon and Willis 2004). However the more \ncomplex shift of focus which an \u2018upstream\u2019 focus was intended to introduce has rarely \nbeen noticed in this official uptake, and which thus has remained riddled with \nconfusion and ambiguity. This can be noted, for example, in the otherwise admirable \nUK Royal Society\/ Royal Academy of Engineering (2004) report on \nnanotechnologies. In contrast to Wynne\u2019s framing of upstream forms of public \nengagement as emphatically not pretending to earlier prediction of impacts or social \nreactions so as better to manage these, the Royal Society\/ Royal Academy of \nEngineering report outlines the potential role of such engagements is help to \nanticipate sensitive issues. For example: \n \nThe hope expressed in evidence submitted to the group is that methods for \nupstream deliberation may help society to find appropriate resolutions for \npotential conflicts in advance, by better anticipation of sensitive issues. (p. 66) \n 17\n \nBy contrast, Wynne and colleagues have stressed the logic that the predicament of \nignorance and unpredictability - of which ordinary publics appear only too aware \n(Marris et al 2001; Grove-White et al.1997) - implies that we need to develop novel \ntechniques aimed at eliciting, explicating and subjecting to wider debate and scrutiny, \nthe driving purposes, expectations, imaginations and social ends of upstream \nknowledge. Such debate would provide a different ethical and social context for \nscientific practice, including R&D investment. \n \nThus, we suggest, upstream engagement does not concern publics telling scientists \nwhat to do or think, nor assert that ordinary people know better than scientists about \nrisks, - as the prevalent, and blatantly confused, prediction-immersed understanding \nof upstream engagement with science still mistakenly implies. Rendering scientific \ncultures more self-aware of their own taken-for-granted expectations, visions and \nimaginations of the ultimate ends of knowledge, and rendering these more articulated, \nand thus more socially accountable and resilient, is a radically different kind of role \nfor the social sciences. This, we argue, lies in science\u2019s own best interest, as it would \nprovide the grounds for a public legitimacy that its patrons and exploiters are so \nanxiously seeking.      \n \nWhat kind of social science is required? \nAs we have demonstrated the science and policy debate around nanotechnologies \nrepresents a novel opportunity for building in the social sciences into its upstream \ndevelopment. As we seek to map out such an agenda, we need to bear in mind that \nsuch upstream terrain has traditionally been regarded as properly fenced off from \n 18\nsocial attention. How can this complex and difficult terrain, as yet uncharted, be \naddressed in a constructive and responsible way?  We conclude this paper by setting \nout a prospective agenda for the social sciences and its potential in the development of \nnanotechnology research and innovation processes. The emergent, undetermined \nnature of nanotechnologies - technoscience \u2018in-the-making\u2019 (Latour 1987) - calls for \nan open, experimental and interdisciplinary model of social science research. From \nthe outset, the ambition is to develop interdisciplinary approaches which seek to \nembrace the complexities of nanotechnologies, and their emergent, materialising and \ncondensing social relationships. We now discuss five potentially rich veins of social \nscience research activity: \n \nI. Imaginaries \nA social science of nanotechnology should seek to unpack the ways in which \nnanotechnology is imagined\u2014in both technical and social terms\u2014and to assess the \nrole that such imaginaries play in innovation processes. Understanding the implicit \nassumptions, values and visions \u2013 or \u2018imaginaries\u2019 \u2013 of key actors has been \nrecognised as a central part of the social science challenge, on account of their \nsignificant role in shaping research and innovation trajectories (Brown and Michael \n2003; Kearnes et al. forthcoming; Hedgecoe and Martin 2003; Rose 2001; van Lente \n1993). \n \nThe term \u2018imaginary\u2019 shares the sense of vision and fantasy implied by the term \n\u2018imagination\u2019. But it dissolves the opposition of the imagined and the real: whether an \nimaginary is based in fantasy or in evidence remains an empirical question rather than \none to be settled a priori (Marcus 1995; Verran 1998). The key point is, imaginaries \n 19\nare materially-powerful; they do shape practices, relationships and commitments \n(which are often rendered irreversible); and as such, they demand reflective, \naccountable attention and debate.   \n \nAs well as shaping the expectations of individuals and institutions, imaginaries are \nmobilised through ongoing public discourses and enacted in everyday practices. They \nare multiple, partial and often internally inconsistent (Fleck 1979; MacKenzie 1992; \nSquier 1995, Suchman and Bishop 2000). Emerging technologies, surrounded by \nambivalence and conflicting narratives of utopia and dystopia, provide fertile ground \nin which the moral dilemmas of modernity are rehearsed. While some visions are \nrepeatedly promoted \u2013 progress\/cornucopia, a world of leisure or the conquest of \ndisease \u2013 others may be repressed in official discourse, such as the narratives of \nFrankenstein or Brave New World (Bloomfield and Vurdubakis 1995).  \n \nScientific practice has traditionally been seen as insulated from such cultural forms, \nyet whether implicitly or explicitly it is routinely influenced by them, as for example, \nthe often unstated \u2018cultural\u2019 drive of science towards \u2018precision\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019. A \nmajor object is to explore what form and extent this influence takes. How do \nimaginaries shape trajectories of scientific research, and help define \u2018doable\u2019 and \nworthwhile scientific problems? What role do they play in the allocation of funding? \nHow do they mobilise public and private interest and opposition? And how can social \nscience help open up such imaginaries to wider public scrutiny and debate, for the \nbenefit of science as well as society? In the context of a general dialectic between \nopenness and closure that characterises any process of innovation, the aim is to open \nup nanotechnological imaginaries and scientific potentialities before they are \n 20\ninadvertently closed-down and \u2018black-boxed\u2019 through commitments to specific \nproblems, products and applications (Stirling 2005).  \n \nNanotechnologies are framed by scientific and engineering imaginaries that have \nlongstanding antecedents (see for example Shapin 1994, Noble 1977; 1997). Their \npromise is infused with dreams of perfect engineering, of complete control over the \nphysical structure of matter and, eventually, the creation of autonomous, self-\nreplicating entities. Such imaginaries render nanotechnologies visualisable and to \nsome extent already familiar (e.g. the macro-level machine expressed at the nano-\nlevel). The ability to operate at the nanoscale \u2013 atom-by-atom \u2013 symbolises an \nexpression or ambition of power. It represents the material world subordinated to \nhuman will with unprecedented degrees of precision and control.  \n \nAt the same time, this vision of total control is something of a double-edged sword if \nnot an Achilles heel. For the empirical invisibility of nanotechnology, beneath the \nthreshold of the human senses (rather like genetic modification and nuclear \ntechnology before it, see: Beck 1992; Erikson 1994), makes it almost impossible to \nverify whether it is in fact under human control - thus providing fertile ground for \nvoices of opposition; for instance, dystopias that build upon Drexler\u2019s imaginary of \nself-replicating \u2018grey goo\u2019 as a central motif. Indeed, whilst this notion of \u2018grey goo\u2019 \nis dismissed by mainstream nanoscientists (Royal Society\/ Royal Academy of \nEngineering 2004), it has achieved a certain prominence among the public and media, \nnot least due to interventions by the heir to the UK throne. In debates over GM food, \nnegative popular imaginaries tended to be dismissed or ignored and it would seem \nprudent that the same mistake is not repeated in the area of nanotechnology.  \n 21\n \nSuch research poses significant methodological challenges including the development \nof novel and reflexive relationships with nanoscientists and other relevant actors, both \nat academic research sites, and within corporate R&D settings. To understand the \nnature, origins and effects of such imaginaries, and to find ways of opening them to \ngreater scientific reflection and public debate, will require informed interaction with \nscientific actors in their own \u2018lifeworlds\u2019. This implies a potential role for social \nscientist ethnographers as a new kind of actor-participant in those scientific \nknowledge-communities. Similar developments are afoot in social science research \nwith the post-genomic sciences.  \n \n II. Public engagement \nA social science of nanotechnologies should ask in what ways can processes of public \ndialogue open up and help indirectly to shape \u2018upstream\u2019 R&D of emerging \nnanotechnologies, and seek to build-in appropriate models of public engagement into \nthe development of nanotechnologies. \n \nSince 2000, when the UK House of Lords Science and Society report buried the \nmisconceived deficit model of public understanding of science (Wynne 1991; 1995), \n\u2018public engagement\u2019 has become the new mantra (at least in UK and EU science \npolicy). Much of this new \u2018listening mode\u2019 for science has been taken up with the aim \nor expectation of restoring public trust and authority for science. The more radical \nidea that public inputs might legitimately reshape scientific and technological \nenterprises as a condition for their public legitimacy has not been a prominent feature \nof the new discourse of public engagement. The suggestion that public engagement \n 22\nmay have several different rationales and objectives, including the stimulation of \ngreater self-reflection within science about its own assumptions and expectations, \neffectively about its own cultural forms, has been made more recently (Wynne 2003). \nAs described before, there is also an emerging consensus that such engagement  \nshould be focussed on upstream processes of R&D priority-setting and funding, in \naddition to the downstream impacts of innovation (Department of Trade and Industry \n2004; Grove-White et al. 2000; HM Treasury 2004; Macnaghten 2004; Nature 2004; \nRoyal Society\/ Royal Academy of Engineering 2004; Wilsdon and Willis 2004; \nWynne 2001) \n \nHowever, even though there is increased policy and institutional acceptance of the \nneed to move upstream, precisely what this entails remains ambiguous and open to \nmultiple interpretations. For some, upstream engagement is still assumed to be about \nearlier anticipation and more effective management of risks, impacts and \nconsequences. Such assumptions downplay a critical dimension of public concern, \nwhich is that there are unpredicted consequences that scientific risk assessment is \nincapable of identifying, whether it takes place upstream, downstream or somewhere \nin between (Marris et al. 2001; Wynne 2001). Instead, publics often want to ask more \nfundamental questions about driving human purposes, ownership, control and \nresponsibility. Modern science and technology in general has suffered an unhealthy \ndearth of any such debate, which has instead been focussed on risk.   \n \nIt has been recognised that nanotechnologies and their convergences with adjacent \ndomains like Information Communication Technologies and biotechnologies, make \nprediction of future effects a decreasingly credible aspiration \u2013 and this from an \n 23\nunpromising starting-point in terms of existing track-record (Joy 2000). The claim of \nreliable predictive control through risk assessment has to be re-thought as the basic \nreflex response of policy and scientific institutions to public concern or hesitation \n(Sarewitz et al. 2000; Guston & Sarewitz 2002). Upstream public engagement may \nsometimes help to create the conditions for better risk prediction. But this should not \nbe the primary reason for this change of focus. Rather it is that upstream processes are \nkey sites of undeliberated shaping of future worlds, as explained in the previous \nsection. If these are to be elicited, debated and maybe amended, social science need to \ndevelop frameworks of accountability and learning which so far remain undeveloped.  \n \nThe methodological challenge is to build on a range of \u2018upstream\u2019 deliberative \nmethods, involving both experts and public, through innovating novel techniques such \nas focus groups, citizen juries, scenario workshops and deliberative mapping (Grove-\nWhite et al. 1997; 2000; Macnaghten 2004; Stirling 2005; Stirling, Davies and \nBurgess 2004), as well as ethnographic methods. Key research questions that need to \nbe addressed are: how can \u2018upstream\u2019 questions be addressed in open, accountable \nand resolvable ways; how can conventional forms of risk assessment and ethical \nanalysis be integrated with wider social and political questions about purposes, \nalternative scientific trajectories, ownership, control and responsibility; and what \nlessons can be drawn from technological domains where upstream public engagement \nis exclusively staged at the downstream stage \u2013 as took place, arguably, in the case of \nGM crops? It is also important to scrutinise what counts as successful public \nengagement. Is it the avoidance of immediate conflict, or longer-term changes \ntowards greater resilience in the culture and practices of science? (Nowotny et al \n2001) \n 24\n \n III. Governance \nBy building social science research into the upstream development of nanotechnology \nit will be possible to innovate new frameworks for the governance and regulation of \nnanotechnologies that seek to be more anticipatory, resilient and socially intelligent. \n \nConfronted with rapidly advancing and converging nanotechnologies, policymakers \nand regulators need to identify frameworks of governance that are adaptive and \nanticipatory, yet which recognize the limits of prediction (Bentley & Wilsdon 2003; \nSarewitz et al. 2000). When technological controversies erupt, the usual political \nresponse has been to look for regulatory solutions based on familiar science-based \ntechniques of risk assessment. This pattern is already evident in debates around \nnanotechnologies, which are focusing heavily on regulatory responses to the \nuncertainties and potential hazards of nanoparticle toxicity (Royal Society\/ Royal \nAcademy of Engineering 2004; European Commission 2004).  \n \nThese responses, using the best science available, are necessary \u2013 but crucially, not in \nthemselves sufficient. Further insights and policy innovations need to be developed \nand explored in practice. As Michael Power has argued, there is now an \noverwhelming tendency in political and organisational life to reach for the \u2018risk \nmanagement of everything\u2019 (Power 2004). However, when faced with potentially \ndisruptive innovations, the danger is that risk assessment \u2013 however participatory \u2013 \nmerely digs us deeper into the hole from which we are trying to escape. It avoids a \nmuch deeper predicament that arises from recognising the realities of ignorance and \nambiguity. Debates that are too often framed in terms only of risk and safety \u2013 \n 25\ntypically asking the question, \u2018Is it safe?\u2019 - imply that the likelihood of certain \noutcomes, and the question of social commitment, is susceptible to rational \ncalculation. More challenging questions that flow from ignorance concern the longer-\nterm social purposes as well as consequences of a technology\u2019s development, and \nwhat are the alternatives that might be available?  \n \nThis concentration on risk is an understandable way of rationalising an otherwise \nopen and daunting set of questions. It reflects what Zygmunt Bauman describes as \nmodernity\u2019s \u201cgardening instinct\u201d (Bauman 1991). Yet this desire to tidy the borders of \nour democracy means that frameworks of governance and regulation may be stripped \nof meaningful content. Fundamental questions arise from further examination of \ntoday's \u2018global knowledge-economy\u2019, perhaps the dominant self-characterisation of \ncontemporary society and its established institutions (de Sousa Santos 2003). What \nkinds of cultural conflict are now emerging centred on the production of scientific \nknowledge? Are there forms of politics (e.g. new social movements and mass forms \nof alienated citizenship) which call for new forms of governance of science and \ntechnology as the major forces shaping human worlds? What new institutional and \norganisational forms may be appropriate to articulate these inchoate, globally-\ndistributed concerns, conflicts and democratic aspirations?  \n \nFrom these wider perspectives, conventional discourses of regulation, risk and ethics \nlook increasingly inadequate. New government commitments to \u2018upstream\u2019 public \ndialogue with science \u2013 if taken seriously \u2013 may run rapidly into head-to-head conflict \nwith concerns about global competitiveness and the economic potential of national \nscience-systems competing aggressively for global investment and trained personnel. \n 26\nThese issues may be difficult to address in a purely national context, especially when \npublic concerns do not correspond with those assumed by scientific, industrial and \npolicymaking elites (Grove-White et al. 1997; Marris et al. 2001).  \n \nIn the case of nanotechnologies, the contours of public concern are not restricted to \nthe risks of nanoparticle toxicity. There are other fundamental questions that need to \nbe asked: Why these technologies? Why not others? Who needs them, and what \nhuman purposes are driving them? Under what conditions will they be enacted; and \nwho sets those conditions? Who is controlling them? Who benefits from them? What \ncontingency-plans might there be to contain unanticipated disasters? Can those in \ncharge be trusted? Drawing on the lessons of from genetic modification and other \ncontroversies, programmes of research need to explore how governance and \nregulation can be extended to incorporate a wider set of cultural and social, and \nindeed technical, factors (Kearnes et al. forthcoming). \n \n \n IV. Globalisation \nFourthly, we need to examine the emerging patterns of nanotechnological innovation \nworldwide, and what social and governance challenges these pose both globally, and \nfor nation-states? \n \nResearch is required to map the shifting geographies of nanotechnological innovation \nand knowledge production. As nanotechnologies start to play a more significant role \nin the global knowledge economy, what new opportunities for wealth creation will \nthey create? How will they contribute to shifts in the global distribution of knowledge, \n 27\nresources and power? What forms will these take? Might they allow developing \nnations to \u2018leapfrog\u2019 into a new technological paradigm? Or might they reinforce \ninadvertent forms of epistemic exclusion, stratified industrialised knowledge-\neconomy divisions of international labor, and new forms of public alienation (Castells \n1996)? How will such governance challenges play out across different geopolitical \nand knowledge sectors?  \n \nIt is important to understand how the global development of nanotechnologies will be \nshaped by the relationship between the different temporalities of technological \ninnovation, regulation and societal deliberation (Jessop 2000). Risk discourses are \nintervening increasingly intensely in the very process of product innovation, shaping \nthe direction of entire industries in ways which are not easily anticipated. \nNanotechnologies are emerging in a situation of \u2018risk sensitisation\u2019, which creates \ntensions between cycles of innovation and capital accumulation, and the need for \ngovernments and industries to respond to public anxieties about possible hazards. \nRegulation, product testing and more expansive modes of public engagement and \ndialogue slow down the process of entry to the marketplace, which may sit in tension \nwith the need for rapid investment return.  \n \nConventional characterisations suggest that precaution acts as a barrier to innovation. \nIn a European context, several recent studies have shown that this is not necessarily \nthe case, and precautionary approaches can in fact act as a stimulus for new forms of \ninnovation (European Environment Agency 2001). However, it remains an empirical \nquestion as to how such interactions will play out on a global scale. Regulation may \nslow down the product cycle, or it may provide advantages to some economic actors, \n 28\npossibly favouring larger corporations over smaller start-ups. It may reinforce the \neconomic power of the US and other leading nations, or enable new, niche players to \nemerge (as for example, Finland became a surprisingly successful player in mobile \ncommunications technologies). In any case the escalating stakes of managing the \npublic acceptance of scientific innovations in the interests of keeping competitive in \nthe global knowledge-economy have brought newly emergent pressures and \nexpectations on the social sciences as policy-actors. Our scholarly communities will \nhave to respond constructively and responsibly to such pressures; our proposals \nattempt to do this in part by tying to step ahead of those pressures, and to suggest \nother opportunities and agenda, both for research and for the policy it hopes to \nenlighten.  \n \nTo summarise a political economy social science agenda might embrace the following \nquestions: Where is nanotechnological R&D being carried out and by which kinds of \ninstitutions; what factors shape, accelerate or impede national and international \ninnovation trajectories; what is the impact of emerging regulatory and governance \n(including civil society) processes on R&D and product development?  And how are \nthese dynamics directly or indirectly influencing the substantive intellectual contents  \nand cultures of nanoscientific knowledge?  \n \n Emergence \nFinally we need to develop new frameworks of theoretical reflection to understand the \nemergence of nanotechnologies, and, in particular, to develop approaches that move \nbeyond conceptualising the future in terms of prediction or control.  \n \n 29\nIn moving from a predictive to post-predictive paradigm, social science needs to \ndevelop a set of theories and methodologies for relating to the complexities of \nmultiple \u2018futures\u2019 (Prigogine 1997; Grove-White et al. 1997; Sarewitz 2000; Wilsdon \n& Willis 2004; Urry 2003). The central notion here is that nanotechnologies are a set \nof dynamic and potentially unbounded systems. Science and technology as cultural \nforms, are the ultimate objects of interest, however precisely these might be defined in \nall their variety. They develop collective patterns and non-linear consequences not \npresent within their individual components. Such systems demonstrate both the \u2018end \nof certainty\u2019 and long-term irreversibilities, as well as heterogeneity and emergence as \nthey become locked in to certain path-dependencies (Prigogine 1997; Rip and Kemp \n1998). \n \nIn exploring the nature of technological emergence, the goal is to understand the \ncomplex role that these systems and their different temporalities play (Adam 1998). A \nnumber of social scientists have analysed the role of expectation, or future-oriented \nimaginaries,  in emerging technologies (see for example: van Lente 1993; van Lente \n& Rip 1998; Brown et al. 2000; Brown 2003; Brown & Michael 2003). Such analyses \nare fundamentally about future promises, and their epistemic and ontological \ndimensions. They suggest that the emergence of new technologies is characterised by \ncomplex and heterogeneous cycles of hope, expectation, hype and disappointment, \nwhich are connected with material realities. Understanding the heterogeneous time \nhorizons and expectation dynamics embedded within new technological domains is \ncrucial to how new technologies may materialise and become \u2018stabilised\u2019 as a \ntransportable \u2018actor-network\u2019.  \n \n 30\nTwenty years ago, the philosopher Hans Jonas warned that \u2018Modern technology has \nintroduced actions of such novel scale, objects and consequences that the framework \nof former ethics can no longer contain them\u2019 (1984, p. 34).  At the time, he had in \nmind the awesome transformations wrought by nuclear and genetic technologies. But \nhis analysis can be applied with equal force to the changes that are underway now at \nthe nanoscale. The questions that Jonas posed can be posed afresh today. If these \ntechnologies enable human interventions at a novel scale \u2013 the very atoms and \nmolecules that are the building blocks of matter \u2013 does this require an equivalent shift \nin the scale of our ethical and sociological imagination? \n \nConclusion \nThis paper has sought to outline a prospective social science agenda on \nnanotechnologies as a particular means to further develop a social science of science, \ntechnology and society relations. Such a programme of research promises to develop \nwider social learning and insight on questions of emerging technologies more \ngenerally, and on the ways in which social and ethical considerations can be build into \nthe technical and scientific agendas at an early stage. A programme of research of this \nkind promises to build capacity in the social sciences in at least three distinct ways. \n \nFirst, it will do so locally by drawing upon, extending and connecting theoretical \ninsights in social theory, postmodernism, actor network theory, science and \ntechnology studies, and complexity. Second, it will significantly advance the theory \nand practice of interdisciplinarity as it applies to collaboration between social \nsciences, humanities, natural sciences and engineering disciplines. Third, it will \ndevelop a social science that engages with and contributes to policy debates in \u2018real-\n 31\ntime\u2019. Both these latter capacity-developments involve more than intellectual \ndevelopments in themselves. They also involve new knowledge-producing \nrelationships and professional responsibilities, with respect to both the natural \nsciences and policy practices. Potentially this would involve social sciences \nbecoming, modestly, actors in those worlds and not only observers and commentators \nof them. \n \nSuch an enhanced capability would enable the social sciences to play a strategic role \nin providing the social research and analysis necessary for the future governance, \nregulation and public appraisal of emerging nanosciences and -technologies. By \nclarifying the differential social values and implications embedded within prospective \nnanotechnology developments such a programme would contribute actively to \nsociety\u2019s resources for more intelligent and more humanly- as well as technically-\nrobust debate and practice in such matters. \n \nREFERENCES: \nAdam, B. 1998.
