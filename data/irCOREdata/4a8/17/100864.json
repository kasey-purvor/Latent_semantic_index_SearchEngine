INTRODUCTION\nNuclei near closed shells represent an excellent opportunity\nto probe important facets of nuclear structure. Nuclides close\nto the Z = 50 shell closure are particularly good for such\ninvestigations, due to the experimental accessibility of many\nZ = 50, tin nuclei across the N = 50\u201382 shell. Of recent\ninterest in this region is the energy evolution of spherical\nproton orbitals with increasing neutron excess, particularly\n\u03c0d 5\n2\n, \u03c0g 7\n2\n, and \u03c0h 11\n2\n[1,2]. These effects are best explored\nin antimony nuclei, with one proton outside a Z = 50 core.\nOne of the first indications of this orbital evolution came\nfrom the observation of a change in the ground-state quantum\nnumber for antimony nuclei, from I\u03c0 = 52\n+ in 121Sb to 72\n+ in\n123Sb [3]. The energy difference between the first excited 52\n+\nand 72\n+\nstates changes by nearly 1.5 MeV in odd-A antimony\nnuclei from 117\u0001A\u0001 133, interpreted as a decrease in energy\nof the \u03c0g 7\n2\norbital relative to \u03c0d 5\n2\nstate [1]. This change\nin energy difference has been interpreted as a signature for\nthe presence of a strong tensor force [4] or a decreasing\nspin-orbit interaction for the d 5\n2\n, g 7\n2\n, and h 11\n2\nlevels with\nincreasing neutron excess [1,2]. These are both consistent with\nan empirical reduction in relative energy between the g 7\n2\nand\nh 11\n2\nproton orbitals, which changes by \u223c2 MeV over odd-A\nantimony nuclei with 117\u0001A\u0001 133 [1,2].\nNuclei near closed-shell boundaries are also a good place\nto simultaneously study both collective and multiparticle\n*gareth.jones2@barcap.com\nexcitations. Strongly coupled rotational structures, built on\n\u03c0h 11\n2\nintruder and \u03c0 (g 9\n2\n)\u22121 excitations, are observed in odd-A\nantimony nuclei with 113\u0001A\u0001 121 [5\u20138]. As the neutron\nnumber increases and the closed N = 82 shell is approached,\nhowever, the excitation energy of these deformed states\nincreases, and the rotational bands are no longer yrast; the\n\u03c0 92 [404] state becomes nonyrast in 123Sb (N = 72), increasing\nin energy to Ex = 1337 keV [9,10]. This simplifies the picture\ndramatically, because all states can be interpreted as spherical\nsingle or multiparticle excitations. In particular, many states\ncan be described in terms of those observed in tin nuclei,\ncoupled to an extra proton [11,12]. Nevertheless, the many\nvalance particles make it difficult to perform detailed shell-\nmodel calculations, and comprehensive experimental data\nprovide a benchmark against which to test the development\nof appropriate theoretical descriptions.\nThis article describes the identification of states in 121,123Sb\nfrom the decay of previously unreported isomeric states.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nThe experiment was performed at Argonne National Labo-\nratory using the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System\n(ATLAS), which delivered a 178Hf beam onto a 208Pb target at\na laboratory energy of 1150 MeV, to study long-lived isomeric\nstates in hafnium-like nuclei (presented in Ref. [13]). This\narticle reports results obtained from incidental fusion-fission\nreactions between the 178Hf projectiles and a 27Al frame\nsupporting the 208Pb target.

Level scheme for transitions in\n121Sb, observed in the long-pulsing experi-\nment from the decay of a T1\/2 = 200(30) \u00b5s\nisomer. Widths of arrows indicate the inten-\nsity of particular \u03b3 -ray decays.\nThe resulting \u03b3 -ray decays from all reaction products were\nmeasured using the Gammasphere array [14], comprising 101\nCompton-suppressed germanium detectors in this experiment.\nThe beam was bunched into short pulses of width \u223c0.5 ns,\nseparated by periods of 82.5 ns. This pulsing was utilized\nto deliver short and long pulsed-beam conditions, enabling\nthe study of metastable states in the 10\u22129 \u2192 10\u22124 s range.\nIn the short-pulsing experiment, 1 of 10 beam pulses was\nincident on the target, resulting in a 825-ns inspection period\nwithin which delayed \u03b3 -ray decays could be studied. Events\nwhere two or more coincident \u03b3 rays were detected within\na 2-\u00b5s range were written to tape for subsequent off-line\nanalysis. In the long-pulsing measurement, a 25-\u00b5s beam-on\nperiod preceded a 75-\u00b5s beam-off period during which the\ndata acquisition system was triggered by single \u03b3 -ray events\nand time stamped using an external 10-MHz oscillator clock.\nGreat care was taken to calibrate the HPGe detectors for \u03b3 -ray\nenergy measurements, using a number of \u03b3 -ray sources.\nIII. DATA ANALYSIS\nThe nature of the fusion-fission reaction process leads to\nthe detection of a large number of \u03b3 rays emitted from excited\nstates in a broad range of nuclei, resulting in a highly complex\ndata set. Due to this level of complexity, it was necessary\nto utilize multidimensional \u03b3 -ray coincidence techniques to\ncorrelate decays associated with particular nuclides. A number\nof coincidence cubes corresponding to different \u03b3 -ray time and\nenergy coincidence conditions were created for both the short-\npulsing and long-pulsing experiments. These were analyzed\nwith software packages described in Refs. [15\u201317].\nA combination of the high statistics obtained in this exper-\niment and the high granularity of the Gammasphere detector\narray allow for a \u03b3 -\u03b3 angular correlation analysis to be per-\nformed on pairs of coincident transitions from the decay of iso-\nmeric states. Each of the detectors in the Gammasphere array\nis associated with angles (\u03b8, \u03c6) with respect to the orientation\nof the beam axis. Pairs of \u03b3 -ray coincidence events (E\u03b31 , E\u03b32 )\nwere placed into symmetric matrices according to the angle be-\ntween the detectors, \u03b4, expressed by cos \u03b4 = cos (\u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61) \u00d7\nsin \u03b81 sin \u03b82 + cos \u03b81 cos \u03b82 [18]. The detector pairs were\ngrouped into 11 bins with average angular differences of\n\u00af\u03b4 = 22\u25e6, 40\u25e6, 54\u25e6, 66\u25e6, 76\u25e6, 90\u25e6, 104\u25e6, 114\u25e6, 126\u25e6, 140\u25e6, and\n158\u25e6, each with 350 < N < 700 combinations. The groups\nwere chosen to evenly spread the number of detector com-\nbinations over a range of cos2(\u03b4) values. The intensity of a\ngiven transition pair was measured for each of the groupings\nusing the symmetric matrices, and normalized with the\nrelative efficiency of the detector pairs. Angular-correlation\ncoefficients (Akk) were obtained from a fit to the intensities of\nthe \u03b3 -\u03b3 (\u03b4) coincidence events to the function:\nW (\u03b4) = 1 + A22P2(cos \u03b4) + A44P4(cos \u03b4), (1)\nwhereP2 andP4 are Legendre polynomials. Values ofAkk were\ncompared with those calculated, using the procedure described\nin Ref. [19].\nIV. RESULTS\nA. 121Sb\nTransitions from the decay of a previously unobserved\nmicrosecond isomer were identified in the long-pulsing ex-\nperiment. \u03b3 rays from the decay of states in 121Sb were\nidentified in projections of double coincidence gates placed\non \u03b3 rays from Ref. [11]. The updated level scheme from\nthe analysis of this experiment is illustrated in Fig. 1; three\nstates at energy, Ex = 2057.1, 2150.3, and 2551.2 keV are\nreported for the first time. Table I provides a summary of all\n121Sb transitions observed in the measurement; asterisks (\u2217)\nindicate transitions observed for the first time. The relative\n\u03b3 -ray intensities were established from spectra under different\ndouble-gating conditions.\n034311-2\nHIGH-SPIN, MULTIPARTICLE ISOMERS IN 121,123Sb PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 034311 (2008)\nTABLE I.

The\nstructure on the left side is the rotational band built on the\n\u03c0 92 [404] orbital [8], also observed in lighter odd-A antimony\nisotopes with 113\u0001A\u0001 119 [5\u20138].

The Weisskopf single-\nparticle transition rates for the 287- and 41-keV \u03b3 -ray decays,\nfrom an isomeric state with T1\/2 = 200 \u00b5s, are B(E1) = 3.5 \u00d7\n10\u221211 and B(M1) = 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22128 W.u., respectively. These are\ninconsistent with transition rates observed systematically [21]\nby at least four orders of magnitude. It follows that to\naccount for the isomeric half-life another level must exist\nthat decays to the Ex = 2721.1 keV state via an unobserved,\nlow-energy, highly converted transition, expressed by \b in\nFig. 1. By considering typical Weisskopf transition rates [21],\nthe efficiency of Gammasphere, and the magnitude of the\ninternal conversion process, the energy and multipolarity of \b\ncan be restricted to E\b(E2) < 60 keV or E\b(M2) < 80 keV.\nBased on these limitations, the Ex = 2721.1 + \b keV state is\ntentatively assigned spin I = ( 252 ).\nA number of previously unobserved \u03b3 rays, shown in\nFig. 2(c), reveal the existence of a state at Ex = 2057.1 keV.\nThe 85-keV transition is in coincidence with 1022-, 918-, and\n913-keV \u03b3 rays, which decay to the Ex = 1035.5, 1139.4,\nand 1144.6 keV states, respectively. Intensity-balance mea-\nsurements, summarized in Table II, indicate E1 multipolarity\nfor the 85-keV \u03b3 ray; the Ex = 2057 keV level is assigned a\nspin parity of I\u03c0 = 132\n+\n.\nA state with energy Ex = 2551.2 keV is inferred from\nthe observation of 117- and 170-keV \u03b3 rays [see spectra in\nFigs. 2(d) and 2(e)]. The tentative 409-keV transition to the\nEx = 2142.0 keV level, illustrated in Fig. 2(e), suggests the\nordering of the 117- and 170-keV \u03b3 rays. Using intensity-\nbalance arguments, summarized in Table II, the 117- and\n170-keV \u03b3 rays are provided with M1 and M1 or E1\nmultipolarity, respectively.

The coincidence between the 401- and\n715-keV \u03b3 rays implies that the 401-keV transition should\nbe placed between the Ex = 2551.2 and 2142.0 keV levels.\nHowever, the energy of the \u03b3 ray does not match the difference\nbetween the states; a discrepancy of 8.3 keV remains. This\nprovides evidence for another state at an energy of either\nEx = 2542.9 or 2150.3 keV. Because it is less likely that an\n8.3-keV transition of any multipolarity would compete with the\n117- or 409-keV transitions (from the Ex = 2542.9 keV state),\na tentative state of energy, Ex = 2150.3 keV is, therefore,\nassigned to 121Sb.\nIn addition to the microsecond isomer, the Ex =\n2434.3 keV, I\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\nstate was observed to be isomeric.\nFigure 2(f) provides the time difference between 287- and\n292-keV \u03b3 rays. A folded Gaussian plus exponential fit\nof these data indicates a half-life of T1\/2 = 8.5(5) ns. The\ntransition strengths for the 78-keV (E1) and 292-keV (E2)\ntransitions are B(E1) = (4.1 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 10\u22126 and B(E2) =\n0.78(10) W.u., respectively. These are comparable with the\ntransition strengths of the E1 and E2\u03b3 rays decaying from\nthe I\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\n, Ex = 2553.6 keV state in 119Sb (B(E1) =\n7.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 and B(E2) = 0.026 W.u., respectively [23]).\nB. 123Sb\nThe decay of two isomers has been observed for the\nfirst time. \u03b3 rays from the decay of states in 123Sb were\nidentified in projections of double coincidence gates placed\non \u03b3 rays first reported in Ref.

The correlation between the 1089- and 128-keV\ntransitions indicated either pure quadrupole (probably E2) or\nmixed dipole\/quadrupole (probably M1\/E2) character for the\n1089-keV \u03b3 ray, which is consistent with the evaluation in\nRef. [24]. Angular correlations summarized in Table III\nindicate pure quadrupole or mixed dipole\/quadrupole charac-\nter for the 442- and 956-keV transitions. In addition to angular\ncorrelation measurements, the nonobservation of transitions\nlinking the Ex = 2044.4, 2486.3, and 2614.1 keV states\nto the (negative-parity) states on the left side of Fig. 4,\nindicated differences in angular momenta of \bI \u0002 2. On the\nbasis of these arguments, the Ex = 1088.6, 2044.4, 2486.3,\nand 2614.1 keV states are assigned spins and parities of\nI\u03c0 = 112\n+\n, 152\n+\n, 192\n+\n, and 232\n+\n, respectively.\nThe T1\/2 = 52(3) \u00b5s half-life appears to derive from the\nEx = 2614.1 keV level, decaying via the 128-keV transi-\ntion. This corresponds to a single-particle transition rate\nof B(E2) = 5.3(1) \u00d7 10\u22123 W.u. This is approximately 5\ntimes smaller than that of the I\u03c0 = 212\n\u2212\nstate in 121Sb and\n10 times smaller than the I\u03c0 = 212\n\u2212\nstate in 119Sb [12].\nIn regard to the discrepancy in transition strength, it is\nnoted that the T1\/2 = 52 \u00b5s half-life may derive from a\nstate higher in energy than the Ex = 2614.0 keV level,\ndecaying via an unobserved, low-energy, highly converted\ntransition.\n034311-5\nG.

Despite these\ndifferences, the multiparticle level structure of these nuclei is\nwell described by considering neutron states in neighboring\ntin nuclei coupled to the extra proton [11,12].\nFigure 7 illustrates a systematic correlation between the\nyrast states in 121,123Sb and their tin isotones, 120,122Sn. The\nI\u03c0 = 10+ state, present in even-tin nuclei from 116\u0001A\u0001 130,\nis interpreted as a pure \u03bd(h 11\n2\n)2 excitation [12,25]. Similarly,\nthe I\u03c0 = 252\n+ levels in 117,119Sb are associated with a d 5\n2\nproton maximally aligned to the I\u03c0 = 10+ states in the\nneighboring isotones 116,118Sn [12]. The I\u03c0 = ( 252\n+) spin\nparity of the isomeric state in 121Sb is systematically consistent\nwith the spin of the isomeric states in 117,119Sb. As such,\nthe configuration of the isomer is adopted tentatively as\n\u03c0d 5\n2\n\u2297 \u03bd(h 11\n2\n)2. However, it is noted that because the energy\nbetween the d 5\n2\nand g 7\n2\nproton orbitals is so small (\u223c50 keV\n[1]), there is likely to be a significant \u03c0g 7\n2\nadmixture in the\nwave function of these states.\nIt is important to note a limitation with this assessment,\nbased on energy\/spin systematics in nearby Sn isotones,\nbecause there are large discrepancies between the transition\nrates in these nuclei: the 197-keV transition in 120Sn (from\nthe I\u03c0 = 7\u2212 state) is approximately 200 times faster than\nthe analog E2 transition in 121Sb (from the I\u03c0 = 192\n\u2212\nstate),\nwhereas the 163-keV transition in 122Sn (from the I\u03c0 = 7\u2212\nstate) is approximately 15 times faster than the 201-keV\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n20 40 60 80\nTime (  s)\nCo\nun\nts \npe\nr 2\n   \ns\n0\n20\n40\n60\nCo\nun\nts \npe\nr k\neV\n0 100 200\nTime Difference (ns)\n1\n10\n100\nCo\nun\nts \npe\nr 2\n.2\n n\ns\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nEnergy (keV)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0 200 400 600 800\nTime (ns)\n100\nCo\nun\nts \npe\nr 2\n2 \nns\n400\n300\n200\n100\n\u03c72\/\u03bd=0.9\n(b) T1\/2=52(3)   s\u00b5\nT1\/2=37(4) ns\n\u03c72\/\u03bd=1.5\nT1\/2=190(30) ns\n\u03c72\/\u03bd=3.9\n(f)\n(c)\n\u00b5\n\u00b5\n12\n8\n44\n2\n20\n1\n38\n2\n16\n0\n38\n2\n39\n6\n(a)\n(d)\n(e)\n{1089}{956}\n{1030}{626} {382,626,1030}{201}\n{1101}{201}\n{201}{382}\n{1089,956,128}\nFIG. 5.

On the basis of\nthe current data we are unable to identify the physical origin\nof such differences; the discrepancies may reflect significant\ndifferences in wave function between these states. Given the\npaucity of an exact theoretical description for these states, such\nas that provided by shell-model calculations with a physical\nmodel space, such assignments should be made with caution.\nNevertheless, the correlation between the energies\/spins of\nstates in neighboring Sn and Sb nuclei is striking, for which,\nin the absence of such theoretical examination, it may seem\nsensible to draw these comparisons.\nShell-model calculations have been performed for\n127,129,131Sb and 126,128,130Sn using the model space and\nHamiltonian described in Ref. [26], with the shell-model codes\nOXBASH [27] and ANTOINE [28]. It was not possible to perform\ncalculations for lighter antimony nuclides without severely\ntruncating the model space.

According to Fig. 9, the I\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212\nand 192\n\u2212\nstates\nin odd-antimony nuclei are lowered by up to E \u223c 250 keV. The\noccupation numbers for the wave functions of the I\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212\nand 192\n\u2212 levels in 127,129,131Sb, from Table V, illustrate the\ndominance of the \u03c0g 7\n2\norbital. The monopole energy shift of\nthe \u03c0g 7\n2\nlevel has been interpreted as a signature of a strong\ntensor force between the h 11\n2\nneutron and g 7\n2\nproton orbitals\nwith increasing neutron excess in the \u03bdh 11\n2\nsubshell [4]. The\nsystematic (\u223c250 keV) energy difference between states in\ntin and antimony, illustrated in the bottom panel of Fig. 9,\nis interpreted here as the manifestation of this residual\ninteraction between the g 7\n2\nproton and h 11\n2\nneutron. In Fig. 9\nthe energy difference is reduced to almost zero as neutron\nnumber approaches N = 68, the inversion point of the g 7\n2\nand\nd 5\n2\nprotons. At this point, the d 5\n2\nproton would be expected\nto have a significant contribution to the wave function of the\nI\u03c0 = 152\n\u2212\nand 192\n\u2212\nstates. The energy difference here thus\nillustrates a reduction in the residual interaction between the\n\u03bdh 11\n2\nand \u03c0d 5\n2\nparticles indicated in Ref. [4].\nVI. SUMMARY\nIn conclusion, high-spin states have been identified in\nthe stable nuclei, 121,123Sb following fusion-fission reactions\nbetween 178Hf and 27Al. Multidimensional \u03b3 -ray coincidence\ntechniques have been used to identify a number of previously\nunreported states, including four isomers. Angular correla-\ntion measurements have been used with intensity-balance\ntechniques to identify spins and parities of states in these\nnuclei. The states observed in these nuclei are interpreted\nas multiparticle states formed from the coupling of a d 5\n2\nor\ng 7\n2\nproton with \u03bdh 11\n2\n, \u03bds 1\n2\n, and \u03bdd 3\n2\nexcitations, observed in\nneighboring tin nuclei.\nThe energies of negative-parity states have been compared\nin tin and antimony nuclei. The difference in these energies\nhas been interpreted as the manifestation of the proton-neutron\nresidual interaction, recently associated with a strong tensor\nforce.\nShell-model calculations have been performed for\n126,128,130Sn and 127,129,131Sb. The calculated excitation ener-\ngies of states in these nuclei compare favorably with those\nobserved empirically and predict the existence of a low-\nlying I\u03c0 = 232\n+\nstate in 127Sb. Using systematic arguments,\na I\u03c0 = 232\n+\nstate is also expected in 125Sb, as the isotopic\nanalog of I\u03c0 = 232\n+\nstates in odd-A antimony nuclei from\n123\u0001A\u0001 131.\nShell-model calculations provide an accurate description\nfor excited states around the \u201cdoubly magic\u201d 132Sn core.\nHowever, as the number of valence particles\/holes increases,\nthe resources required to perform such calculations increases\nexponentially. The spectroscopic results obtained in this work\nhave contributed to the data available for Z = 51 nuclei\nbetween stability and the closed-shell at N = 82 and provide\nan empirical benchmark for which to test the development of\nthese theoretical descriptions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author acknowledges helpful discussions with\nR.
