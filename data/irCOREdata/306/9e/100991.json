INTRODUCTION\nIn the last 20 years, significant experimental and theoretical\nefforts have been devoted to the investigation of the shell\nstructure of light neutron-rich nuclei close to the drip line.\nRecently, it has been shown that the proton p shell nuclei with\n2\u20133 valence neutrons above the N = 8 shell closure have a\nweaker neutron-neutron effective interaction than expected.\nMore precisely, the USD part of the WBT interaction of\nWarburton and Brown [1] needs to be reduced to describe the\nexcitation energies of the neutron-rich carbon and boron nuclei\n[2,3]. Similar differences between theory and experiment were\nobserved concerning the excited states of 17N, as well as the\nmagnetic moment of the odd boron isotopes [4]. In the present\npaper, we extend the systematics by new experimental data on\n19\u221222N, and investigate the strength of the effective interaction\nnext to the Z = 8 region. Special emphasis is placed on\nthe strength of the N = 14 subshell closure which seems to\ndisappear in the Z = 6 nucleus 20C [3].\nRecently, the weakening of the Z = 8 shell closure has also\nbeen reported in 20O [5] observed by study of the proton cross\nshell excitations which are known in the nitrogen isotopes, as\nwell. The extension of their investigations into a more neutron-\nrich region might provide information on the strength of the\nZ = 8 shell closure up to N = 14 at Z = 7.\nPreviously, limited knowledge on the excited states of 19N\nwas collected from multinucleon transfer reactions [6,7]. From\nthese, it is expected that the states arising from a coupling of the\np1\/2 proton hole to the 2+, 4+ states of the 20O core are mostly\nexcited [7]. The ground state spin of 19,21N was determined to\nbe 1\/2\u2212 and that of 20N to be 2\u2212 [8]. No experimental data are\navailable for the excited states of nitrogen nuclei heavier than\nA = 19.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nThe experimental study of the heavy nitrogen isotopes was\nperformed at GANIL by using the same methods which were\nalready applied to investigate the neutron-rich oxygen [9] and\nneon [10] isotopes. Two experiments were carried out: the\nsingle-step and the double-step fragmentation reactions. In the\nfirst experiment, a 9Be target of 2.77 mg\/cm2 thickness was\nbombarded by a 36S16+ beam of 77.5 MeV A energy and of\n1 pnA intensity. The emerging fragments were identified at\nthe focal plane of GANIL\u2019s magnetic spectrometer (SPEG)\nby ionization and drift chambers, and a plastic scintillator\ndetermining their energy loss, position, total energy, and time\nof flight. The time data were corrected, to obtain a better\nresolution, by use of the position of the fragments in the focal\nplane of the SPEG. As we did not observe any overlap between\nthe different charge states, this identification method alone\ngave a perfect separation of the fragments. The SPEG was\ntuned to the A\/Z = 8\/3 mass-to-charge ratio corresponding\nto about 19N, but the isotope 21N was also transmitted. In the\nexperiment, about 2 \u00d7 106 19N, 1.5 \u00d7 105 20N, and 7500 21N\nnuclei were observed.\nIn the second experiment, we used a primary beam of\n36S delivered by the two GANIL cyclotrons at an energy of\n77.5 MeV A and an intensity of 400 pnA on a carbon target\n0556-2813\/2008\/77(4)\/044303(8) 044303-1 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society\nD. SOHLER et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 044303 (2008)\nof 348 mg\/cm2 thickness placed in the SISSI device. The pro-\nduced nuclei were selected through the ALPHA spectrometer\nusing a 130 mg\/cm2 Al wedge. The magnetic rigidity of the\nALPHA spectrometer and the optics of the beamline were\noptimized for the transmission of a secondary beam mainly\ncomposed of 24F, 25,26Ne, 27,28Na, and 29,30Mg fragments with\nenergies varying from 54 to 65 MeV A. An \u201cactive\u201d target\ncomposed of a plastic scintillator (103 mg\/cm2) sandwiched\nbetween two carbon foils of 51 mg\/cm2 each was used at the\ndispersive focus of the SPEG. The plastic scintillator part of\nthe active target was used to identify the incoming nuclei via\nenergy loss and time-of-flight measurements. The fragments\ninduced by reactions of the secondary beam were collected and\nidentified at the focal plane of the SPEG spectrometer, which\nwas optimized for products with A\/Z = 3. In this experiment,\n16 \u00d7 103 20N, 9 \u00d7 103 21N, and 525 22N nuclei were observed.\nThe nitrogen nuclei produced in excited states in the\nfragmentation reactions decayed emitting \u03b3 rays in flight.\nThese \u03b3 rays were observed by the \u201cChateau de crystal\u201d\nBaF2 array in both the single- and double-step fragmentation\nexperiments. The 74 BaF2 crystals of the Chateau were situated\nsymmetrically above and below the target at a mean distance\nof 20 cm covering nearly 4\u03c0 solid angle. The BaF2 array had\na photo-peak efficiency of about 30% at about 1.3 MeV with\nan average full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 12% after\nDoppler-correction. Because the crystals were closely packed,\nthe \u03b3 rays could easily scatter among them. To decrease the\nbackground caused by the scattered \u03b3 rays, we used the\narray in add-back mode. In the single-step fragmentation\nexperiment, four hyper pure Ge detectors were also placed\naround the target. The high-resolution Ge detectors of 70%\nefficiency were located at about 15 cm from the target at the\nmost backward angles of 162\u25e6 and 145\u25e6 with respect to the\nbeam direction. Their overall total photo-peak efficiency was\n\u223c0.12% at about 1.3 MeV. The Doppler shift caused by the\nlarge fragment velocity (v\/c = 0.34) was taken into account\nas a correction in the \u03b3 -ray spectra. The additional information\nprovided by the SPEG on the momenta of the fragments was\nalso applied to improve the Doppler correction. After these\ncorrections, a FWHM of about 38 keV was obtained at the\n\u03b3 -ray energy of \u223c1500 keV.\nThe high-resolution spectra of the Ge detectors helped to\nunfold the \u03b3 lines in the complex spectrum of 19N and to\nprecisely determine the energy of the most intense transition\nof 20,21N. For the less populated heavier nitrogen isotopes,\nthe weaker \u03b3 rays were identified by the BaF2 detectors. The\nrelatively high efficiency of this array made the observation of\nthe \u03b3 \u03b3 -coincidence relations of the stronger transitions also\npossible, which were used to construct the level schemes.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe produced number of 19N was large enough to have\nreasonable statistics in the \u03b3 -ray spectrum of the germanium\ndetectors presented in Fig. 1. Besides the strongest 532 and\n1141 keV transitions, several weaker \u03b3 lines appear. Therefore,\nwe assign five additional \u03b3 rays with the energies of 1368,\n1494, 1681, 2132, and 2347 keV to this nucleus. Furthermore,\ntentative \u03b3 lines at 2016 and 2507 keV are found with a 2.6\u03c3\nconfidence level.\nUsing the statistics obtained from the BaF2 detectors,\nwe could create also \u03b3 \u03b3 -coincidence matrices for 19N. The\n\u03b3 \u03b3 -coincidence spectra gated on the most intense 532 and\n1141 keV \u03b3 rays are shown in the insets of Fig. 1. From\nthe analysis of the coincidence spectra, the 532, 1141, and\n1494 keV transitions were found in mutual coincidences.

The insets show BaF2\ncoincidence spectra using the 615,\n844, and 2100 keV transitions as\ngates.\nrelations also with the 2347 keV transition. In addition, the\n1141 keV \u03b3 line is in coincidence with the 1368 keV transition,\ntoo. Although the 1368 and the 1494 keV \u03b3 rays could not be\nresolved in the projection spectrum of the coincidence matrix,\nby putting a gate on both of them, we could determine that\none or both of them are in coincidence with the 1681 keV\ntransition.\nThe heavier 20,21N isotopes were produced by both the\nsingle- and double-step reactions. In the single-step reaction,\nthe detectors were strongly overloaded by \u03b3 rays from other\nreaction channels, which resulted in a high background [10]\nas it is seen also in the coincidence spectra of 19N shown in\nFig. 1. The much cleaner conditions achieved in the radioactive\nbeam experiment [9] resulted in a lower background, allowing\nthe study of weaker radiations, too. Thus, in the following we\nmainly rely on the fragmentation of the radioactive beam.\nIn the BaF2 spectrum of 20N, four well-separated peaks\nare visible at 615(18), 844(18), 1336(23), and 2100(26) keV\nas shown in Fig. 2. The largest peak at 844 keV has a long\ntail, which is due to at least one overlapping peak. The \u03b3 \u03b3 -\ncoincidence spectra presented in Fig. 2 show that the centroids\nof the peaks in the 800\u20131100 keV region seen in different gate\nspectra are different, and they suggest that the strongest peak is\na triplet of \u03b3 rays with energies of 844, 944, and 1052 keV. The\nstrongest 844 keV \u03b3 line is in coincidence with the 1052 and\nthe 2100 keV ones, while the 615 keV line is in coincidence\nwith the 944 keV one.\nIn the 20N spectrum of the germanium detectors measured\nin the single-step fragmentation, only the 843(4) keV line is\nvisible (Fig. 3), which makes possible a precise determination\nof its energy. In spite of the higher background, the existence\nof the 615, 843, 944, and 1336 keV transitions is confirmed by\nthe BaF2 spectrum of this reaction, too.\nFor 21N, only the BaF2 spectrum obtained in the double-\nstep fragmentation (Fig. 4) has statistics large enough for\ntransition assignment. A considerably wide peak at about\n1180 keV dominates the spectrum. By determining the energy\ndependence of the peak width from the systematics of single\npeaks of other nuclei observed in the present experiment, this\npeak could be resolved into two \u03b3 rays with energies of 1159\nand 1228 keV. In addition, we have a wide bump ranging from\nabout 1600 to 2800 keV. This bump can be fitted by three\nweaker \u03b3 rays of 1790, 2142, and 2438 keV. Putting a wide\ngate on the 1159+1228 keV doublet, all the \u03b3 rays assigned\nto this nucleus are enhanced relative to the background; even\nthe small peak at 884 keV becomes significant as shown in\nthe inset of Fig. 4.

The\nenergy of the 1681(5) keV \u03b3 ray overlaps with the 1141(3)+\n532(2) keV sum energy within the error bars; thus, this line\nmay correspond to a cross-over transition. As the 532 and\n1141 keV \u03b3 rays have coincidence relations also with the\n2347 keV transition, it is placed above the 1681 keV level\nestablishing an excited state at 4023 keV.

The two lowest\nenergy excited states at 1143 and 1676 keV as well as the\n2511 keV state are in good agreement with the energy of the\nexcited states obtained in the multinucleon transfer reaction at\n1110(20), 1650(20), and 2540(30) keV [7], respectively.\nAccording to the \u03b3 \u03b3 -coincidence relations, the level\nscheme of 20N consists of three branches of \u03b3 rays. The\nstrongest, 843 keV transition is in coincidence with the 1052\nand 2100 keV transitions, resulting in excited states at 1895 and\n2943 keV. The 615 and 944 keV \u03b3 rays form another cascade\nestablishing a state at 1559 keV. However, their order in the\ncascade is ambiguous, because their intensities are equivalent\nwithin the experimental errors. The 1336 keV transition, not\nseen in coincidence with any other transition, forms the third\nbranch in the level scheme. It is worth mentioning that the\nneutron separation energy of 20N is at 2161(52) keV [12];\nthus, the highest energy state observed in the present case is\nwell above the neutron threshold, similar to the case of 19O [9].\nIn 21N, the 1177 keV transition is the most intense one, and\nit is assigned to the decay of the first excited state to the ground\nstate. The 1177 keV transition was found to be in coincidence\nwith all the 1228, 1790, 2142, and 2438 keV \u03b3 rays. While\nthe higher energy transitions of 2142 and 2438 keV see only\nthe 1177 keV one in coincidence, the 1790 keV \u03b3 ray sees\nboth the 1177 and 1228 keV ones. Thus, the 1228, 2142, and\n2438 keV transitions decay parallel to each other to the\nfirst excited state, and the 1790 keV transition feeds the\nsecond excited state at 2405 keV. The 884 keV transi-\ntion in coincidence with the 1177+1228 keV doublet fits\nthe energy differences between the 3319 and 2405 keV\nstates as well as that of the 4195 and 3319 keV ones\nand is placed there tentatively. Existence of a 1210 keV\ntransition connecting the 3615 and 2405 keV states as\nwell as that of a 2405 keV transition connecting the\n2405 keV state with the ground state cannot be excluded.\nActually, there is some indication of the existence of a\ncoincidence relation between the 1790 and a \u223c2400 keV\ntransition in the gate spectrum shown in the inset of Fig. 4.\nThese transitions are tentatively included in the level scheme.\nIn 22N, we have seen only two transitions, at 183 and\n834 keV, which are in mutual coincidence, thus they are placed\nabove each other forming a \u03b3 -ray cascade. The order of the\ntransitions is determined by their intensities.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nA. Shell model interpretation of the experimental results\nThe structure of the heavy nitrogen isotopes has been\ncalculated by use of the shell model in the full psd shell\nwith the WBT interaction of Warburton and Brown [1], the sd\npart of which is the USD interaction [13].\nComparing the results of the calculation with the exper-\nimental data in Figs. 6 and 8, we see that the theoretical\nspectrum is expanded relative to the experimental one. A\nsimilar situation was observed also in the case of the heavy\ncarbon nuclei [3], where a 25% decrease of the neutron-neutron\ninteraction strength in the sd space was proposed.

[4] a 30% decrease\nof the monopole part of the sd interaction was proposed to\ndescribe the magnetic moment of 17N. This results in an\n\u223c800 keV lowering of the excited states, which seems to be too\nmuch. Using half of this decrease, an \u223c400 keV lowering of\nthe excited states would result in as satisfactory a description\nof the experimental energies as that obtained with the modified\nWBTM interaction.\nTaking into account the calculated decay properties of the\nstates, one can tentatively assign the experimental states to\nthe theoretical ones. Using such an assignment, the first two\nexcited states of 19N arise from the coupling of the p1\/2\nproton hole to the 2+1 state of the 20O core. Comparing only\nthe energies of the experimental and theoretical states, the\n3170 keV state could correspond to the 7\/2\u22121 or the 5\/2\n\u2212\n2\nones.

Proposed level scheme of 22N in comparison with the shell\nmodel calculations based on the WBT and the WBTM interactions.\n1494 keV transition decaying to the likely 5\/2\u22121 state is much\nstronger, we propose that the 3170 keV state corresponds to\nthe 7\/2\u22121 one. The 4023 keV state can be a good candidate\nfor the 7\/2\u22122 theoretical state. The 2511 keV state strongly\npopulates the 1143 keV state which is assigned to the 3\/2\u22121\ntheoretical one, while the 2132 keV state feeds the ground state.\nIn 17N, positive parity states have been observed at 1849 and\n2526 keV [14] having analogous decay patterns to the 2132\nand 2511 keV states in 19N. Thus, these states may correspond\nto the intruder 1\/2+ and 5\/2+ states, respectively; although the\ndecay pattern of the 2132 keV state allows for an assignment\nto the 3\/2\u22122 theoretical state, too.\nIn 21N, the situation is rather similar to the 19N case. The\nfirst two excited states arise from the coupling of the p1\/2\nproton hole to the neutron 2+ excitation of the 22O core, while\nthe 3319 and 4195 keV states are candidates for the 5\/2\u22122 and\n7\/2\u22121 theoretical states arising from the coupling of the p1\/2\nproton hole to the neutron 3+ excitation. The 3615 keV state\nhas no theoretical counterpart among the negative parity states\nand is again a candidate for being the intruder 5\/2+ state.\nFor 20N, the ground state is calculated to be 2\u2212. The\ncalculated level density is much higher than in the odd nuclei,\nwhich makes the assignment of the theoretical states to the\nexperimental ones more difficult. Nevertheless, the assignment\nof the 843 keV state to the 3\u22121 one, the 1895 keV state to\nthe 3\u22122 , and the 2943 keV state to the 4\n\u2212\n1 theoretical one\nseems to be reasonable. The 4\u2212 state lying above the neutron\nseparation energy cannot be created by coupling of the p1\/2\nproton hole to any of the low-lying neutron configurations,\nthus it is based on a core excited state. As a consequence,\nthis state can decay by neutron emission to the 19N ground\nstate only in a two-step process, leaving room for a competing\n\u03b3 -decay channel. The 1336 keV state may correspond to either\na 1\u2212 or a 2\u2212 theoretical configuration. The assignment of the\n944\/615 keV cascade is problematic. Considering the energy\nof these states, it would be a reasonable choice to assign them to\na 1\u2212, 2\u2212 doublet, but the 2\u2212 states are expected to decay with a\nstrong transition to the ground state, whereas such a transition\nis missing from the 1559 keV level. We cannot assign any of\nthe 944 or 615 keV lines to the decay of the 0\u2212 state calculated\nto be the first excited state either, because of its long 8 ns\nlifetime. The \u03b3 cascade in 22N can be assigned to the decay\nof the 2\u2212 state through the 1\u2212 one to the 0\u2212 ground state.\nThe large difference between the calculated and experimental\nsplitting of the \u03c0p1\/2\u03bds1\/2 doublet may arise from the spatially\nextended nature of the neutron s1\/2 state [15]. Such an effect\nmay also explain the problems in the assignment of the states\nof 20N.\nB. Stability of the shell closures\nThe existence of N = 14, 16 subshell closures has already\nbeen deduced from the analysis of the 1985 mass systematics\n[16] and confirmed later for a larger mass region [15]. The\neffect of these subshell closures is clearly shown in the\n24,26Ne isotopes, too, having relatively higher 2+ energies and\nlower E2 transition probabilities than their neighbors. Recent\ntransfer reaction studies of 23O resulted in the determination\nof the energies of the d3\/2 [17] and d5\/2 [18] states relative to\n044303-6\nIn-BEAM \u03b3 -RAY SPECTROSCOPY OF THE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 77, 044303 (2008)\nthe s1\/2 one, which made it possible to deduce the strength of\nthe N = 14, 16 subshell closures at Z = 8.\nThe N = 14 subshell closure in the oxygen isotopes\nresulted in a sudden increase of the 2+1 state in 22O [9],\nwhile such a sign of the N = 14 subshell closure is missing\nin the systematics of the heavy carbon nuclei [3]. Using the\nabove tentative assignments of the experimental states, from\nthe energies of the states coupling of the p1\/2 proton hole to\nthe neutron 2+ excitation, we can estimate an effective energy\nof the 2+ excitation of the core in the extreme weak coupling\nmodel in the heavy nitrogen isotopes. For this purpose, the\n(2j+1) weighted average of the energies of the 3\/21 and 5\/21\nstates can be used following the center-of-gravity theorem\nfirst deduced by R. D. Lawson and J. L. Uretsky [19].\nAt N = 10 and 12, the effective 2+ energies of 1687 and\n1463 keV are slightly smaller than those of the carbon (1766\nand 1585 keV) and oxygen (1982 and 1675 keV) isotopes with\nthe same neutron number. At N = 14, there is a nearly 500 keV\nincrease in the effective 2+ energy, suggesting that the N = 14\nsubshell closure survives to some extent at Z = 7. Following\nthe algorithm proposed in Ref. [9] to deduce the strength of\nthe N = 14 shell closure in 22O, we can deduce it as the\nweighted average of the energies of the effective 2+ and\n3+ core excitations in 21N. It results in 3.02 MeV, which is\n1.2 MeV smaller than the value deduced for 22O. Such a weak-\nening of the N = 14 subshell closure is a result of the removal\nof a proton from the p1\/2 orbit. Using a linear extrapolation, if\nwe remove both p1\/2 protons, the N = 14 shell gap gets only\n1.82 MeV, which may explain why no signs of the N = 14\nsubshell closure are visible in 20C.\nThe transitional nature of the nitrogen isotopes between\nthe oxygen and carbon ones having the same neutron number\nis supported also by the calculated B(E2) values. Using ep =\n1.5 e and en = 0.5 e effective charges, the shell model gives 29\nand 24 e2 fm4 for the B(E2; 0+ \u2192 2+) transition probability\nfor 20O and 22O, respectively, which are in accordance with\nthe experimental values: 28(2) [20] and 21(8) [21] e2 fm4.\nAccording to the weak coupling approximation [22], the sum\nof the E2 strengths from the ground state to the 3\/2\u2212 and\n5\/2\u2212 states in the nitrogen isotopes should equal that of the\nB(E2; 0+ \u2192 2+) strength in their appropriate oxygen cores.\nThe shell model calculations give a 48 e2 fm4 sum strength for\nthe 19N, and a 54 e2 fm4 one for 21N, which are about twice the\noxygen values and lie about half way between the neighboring\noxygen and carbon B(E2; 0+ \u2192 2+) values. This fact shows\nthat the core structure of the nitrogen isotopes is more soft\nthan that of the singly closed shell oxygen isotopes.\nIn 15,17N, the energy of the positive parity intruder states is\nknown, and we have a candidate for the 5\/2+ state in 19,21N,\ntoo. Their energies are 5270, 2526, 2511, and 3615 keV in\n15N [23], 17N [14], 19N, and 21N, respectively. Lowering of\nthe energy of the intruder states in 17,19N can be associated\nwith the binding energy gain due to deformation. On the other\nhand, considering that 15N and 21N are neutron closed shell\nnuclei, the change of the energy of the intruder configuration\ncan be assigned to the change of the shell gap. Thus, adding\nsix d5\/2 neutrons to the 15N nucleus, the Z = 8 shell gap\ngets weaker by 1645 keV. This estimate is in agreement with\nthe previous observation, according to which the Z = 8 shell\ngap gets weaker by 1.5(3) MeV while going from 16O to\n22O [5]. In the shell model calculation, the 5\/2+ state is at\n4.889 keV in 21N, at a slightly lower energy than observed in\n15N. This suggests that the WBT interaction does not account\nfully for the weakening of the Z = 8 shell closure. Indeed, also\nin 19N, the energy of the intruder states is overestimated by\n1.2\u20131.4 MeV. It is worth mentioning that the energy of the\nlowest lying intruder configuration in 20N is calculated at\n1.79 MeV. The presence of an intruder configuration at low\nenergy may be another reason for the difficulties in the assign-\nment of all the 20N states to negative parity configurations.\nV. SUMMARY\nThe structure of the neutron-rich 19\u221222N nuclei has been\ninvestigated by in-beam \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy of the fragmen-\ntation of stable and radioactive beams. From particle-\u03b3 and\nparticle-\u03b3 \u03b3 coincidence relations, \u03b3 rays have been assigned\nto the decay of the excited states of the nuclei investigated,\nand level schemes have been proposed for the first time.\nThe experimental states could be assigned tentatively to\nthe theoretical ones in the odd-mass nuclei 19,21N from a\ncomparison with shell model calculations performed in the\npsd model space. From the mass dependence of the effective\n2+ energy of the neutron core deduced in the extreme weak\ncoupling model from the tentatively assigned states in the\nnitrogen isotopic chain, a partial survival of the N = 14\nsubshell closure was deduced, the strength of which has been\nestimated at 3.02 MeV. A 1.6 MeV decrease of the Z = 8\nshell closure was also deduced as a result of adding six d5\/2\nneutrons to 15N from the change of the energy of the proposed\nintruder proton d5\/2 configuration. A discrepancy between the\ncalculated and measured energies of the excited states was\nobserved using the WBT interaction, which suggests that the\nUSD part of the WBT interaction is about 12.5% stronger than\nrequired. This reduction is half the value observed in heavy\ncarbon nuclei [3], as well as the value proposed to account for\nthe correlations needed to interpret the magnetic moment of\n17N [4].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been supported by the European Community\nthrough the Eurons Contract RII3-CT-2004-506065, by OTKA\nT46901, K68801, NSF PHY-0244453, and by Czech Republic\nGA No. 202\/04\/0791 grants.\n[1] E.
