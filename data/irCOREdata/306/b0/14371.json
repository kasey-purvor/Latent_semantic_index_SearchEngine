Two\nsuch approaches are the 'justice' approach as exemplified by Kohlberg's six stages of moral\ndevelopment, and the 'care ethic' approach as exemplified by Gilligan's work on empathy as\na base for moral decision-making. Each of these approaches can be demonstrated through\ndifferent instructional strategies in the ethics education course, but each strategy is often\ndifficult to execute in practice, given time and resource constraints.\nIntroduction\nProblems in the delivery of ethics education\nEthics education in university is not a field in which one can easily imagine extensive use\nof educational software. There are, for instance, no drill-and-practice programs in ethics\neducation because there are no unambiguous answers to ethical problems. That is what\nethics is all about: complex moral dilemmas without single solutions. Ethics courses\nusually offer theories from great philosophers about how to deal with moral dilemmas.\nAnd usually they offer students a chance to deal with a dilemma themselves.\nIt is in this second part of ethics education where didactic difficulties often arise. In order\nto deal with a dilemma, the students need to be able to discuss this dilemma with fellow\nstudents. Therefore, a class oriented toward such discussion should not consist of more\nthan a small number of students, perhaps 20. This limit is in many higher-education\nsettings exceeded with the consequence that only a small number of students get a chance\nto speak up. Cost cutbacks restrict the number of tutor-led seminar groups that can be\nformed out of large lecture groups.\n4\nALT J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nAnother difficulty arises in the experience of a real dilemma. When does a dilemma offer\na real-life experience? Can a description of a case in a few lines be called a real dilemma?\nIn other words: what is needed to get the empathy and engagement of a student in a\ncomplex case?\nTwo projects involving educational software for ethics education\nThere appear to be useful possibilities for educational software in the context of these two\ndifficulties. One application of educational software could be to provide a substitute for\nthe dialogue aspects of face-to-face small-group discussions, and a second application is\nto create an electronic learning environment in which students are able to experience a\nreal-life moral dilemma from a variety of perspectives and with a number of sensory\nmodalities.\nIn this paper, we will describe two projects for ethics education in which we have been\ninvolved, and which were concerned with the design, development, and evaluation of\neducational software for the two types of applications described above. The first is the\nCOLADA project of the Educational Centre at the University of Twente in The\nNetherlands (de Mink, 1991). In this project, software is created which offers students the\nopportunity to participate in a heated discussion with electronic partners about a\ndescribed case involving an ethical dilemma. The second project is called the THEORIA\nproject (Watkins, 1992). It is being carried out by the Center for the Advancement of\nApplied Ethics at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. The\nemphasis in the software of the THEORIA project is not on discussion or rational\narguments, but on being able to offer students a close-to-real-life experience of a case\ninvolving a complex ethical dilemma.\nThe conceptual backgrounds of these two projects seem to be contradictory: COLADA\nstresses rational discussion, while THEORIA emphasizes an increase in students'\nsensitivity and empathy. However, in ethics education both approaches are necessary.\nTherefore, each project addresses a different difficulty in the delivery of ethics education\nin the higher-education setting.\nIn this paper, we will describe the conceptual background as well as examples of the\nsoftware developed in the two projects, and give an evaluation of the software from\ndifferent perspectives of educational effectiveness. Furthermore, we will raise the question\nof combining both conceptual orientations in one electronic learning resource. This could\nbe an efficient way to deal with the two difficulties - compensating for lack of\nopportunity for intensive face-to-face discussions, and inadequate exposure to the\ncomplexity of an ethical dilemma - in the delivery of ethics education that were noted\nabove.\nThe COLADA project\nKohlberg and the six stages of moral development\nThe theoretical background of the COLADA project at the University of Twente in The\nNetherlands lies in the philosophical position called the 'ethics of justice' or of reason. A\ncentral person associated with this approach is Lawrence Kohlberg (1981). His theory is\n5\nMarike Hettinga and Betty Cottis Ethics education and educational software\nbuilt around the concept of a fixed and universal sequence of moral development.\nAccording to Kohlberg, this moral development can be divided into six stages. Every\nperson passes through a number of these stages. However, their rate of velocity of\nevolution may differ and so also their final stage of development. Some people reach the\nhighest stage while others do not get any further than, for instance, stage 3. Kohlberg's\nsix stages are briefly indicated in Table 1.\nTable 1: Kohlberg's six stages\nStage Description\nStage 1 Right is literal obedience to rules and authority (parents), avoiding punishment,\nand not doing physical harm.\nStage 2 Right is serving one's own or other's needs and making fair deals in terms of\nconcrete exchange: \"You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours'.\nStage 3 The right is playing a good (nice) role, being concerned about other people and\ntheir feelings, keeping loyalty and trust with partners, and being motivated to\nfollow rules and expectations.\nStage 4 The right is doing one's duty in society, upholding the social order, and main-\ntaining the welfare of society or the group.\nStage 5 The right is upholding the basic rights, values, and legal contracts of society,\neven when they conflict with the concrete rules and laws of the group.\nStage 6 This stage assumes guidance by universal ethical principles that all humanity\nshould follow. Principles are universal principles of justice: the equality of\nhuman rights and respect for the dignity of human beings as individuals.\nKohlberg, 1981, pp. 409-12.\nHow did Kohlberg come to the definition of these stages? The stages reflect a division of\nthe kind of arguments people use when confronted with a moral dilemma. Kohlberg did\nresearch in many different contexts and cultures, and concluded that there were six\ndifferent and sequentially more adequate ways of dealing with an ethical dilemma\n(Kohlberg, 1981). The six stages can be placed in a hierarchical order. Each stage reflects\na higher degree of abstraction and is more widely applicable than the former; thus\naccording to Kohlberg, each stage is ethically more adequate than those that have\npreceded it.\nThe arguments used in Kohlberg's highest stage are based on what are defined as the\nprinciples of justice: the equality of human rights and respect for the dignity of human\nbeings as individuals (Kohlberg, 1981). These principles are universal. They can be\nrationally derived and argued. Sensitivity and emotion should not play a role in moral\ndecision-making, since such feelings can differ from person to person, and may be unable\nto rise above the specifics of a certain situation. So, according to Kohlberg's approach to\nethical development, feelings and emotions will never lead to universal ethical principles.\nUniversalization is the central issue in the highest stage. A guideline here is the Golden\nRule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\n6\nALT J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nEthics education reflecting Kohlberg\nBased on this theory, Kohlberg developed an educational method which he called\ninteractive progressivism (Kohlberg, 1981). The essence of this method is that the\nindividual's progress through the different stages of moral development needs to be\nstimulated. Since this development follows a natural sequence, ethics education should be\nfree of indoctrination. Moral development can be stimulated through interaction between\nthe student and the environment The student should actively deal with moral situations.\nThis can be done by confronting the student with a dilemma for which he or she does not\nhave an immediate solution. Thus his or her present stage of development is not\nadequate. Next, the students should be confronted with arguments from a higher stage\nthan their current level. The students will experience that these arguments are more\nadequate to deal with the problem than are arguments of a lower stage. Intense discussion\nwith a skilled mentor is a good means for confronting students with arguments from a\nhigher stage.\nEducational software reflecting Kohlberg's philosophy of ethical development\nThe COLADA shell for software to engage the student in dialogue about an ethical\ndilemma\nThe COLADA project being carried out at the Educational Centre at the University of\nTwente is based on the philosophy of justice and on Kohlberg's conception of a fixed\nsequence of stages of moral development. The Centre has been contracted to develop\neducational software for ethics education based on the educational method of Kohlberg\nCOLADA 2.30 E demo-version (c) P.

The software is being produced through the use of a relatively simple authoring\npackage, also called COLADA 2. This package provides a shell into which a brief textual\ndescription of an ethical dilemma can be entered, and response options reflecting different\nstages of moral development can be offered to the respondent. Following each choice of\nresponse by the student, a new set of options and associated 'discussion' can be offered by\nthe software. This means that within a preset didactical structure, the contents can be\nvaried to reflect as many different ethical dilemmas as the instructor wishes the students\nto consider. The following description shows the general structure of the COLADA\nprogram, through one of the cases developed by the first author of this paper.\nAn example of an ethical dilemma presented by COLADA\nThe student is shown a case containing a moral dilemma, in this example a dilemma\nconcerning secretly dumped chemical waste (Figure 1).\nThe students are asked to imagine that they are one of the central figures in this dilemma,\nand that they will have to make an ethical decision in the case. The students can choose\none of a number of response possibilities. Next, another 'person' from the case will react\nto the response choice of the students (Figure 2).\nThis process, involving pre-programmed branching options, can be continued a number\nof times. If the students wish, they can also ask for a reaction from the 'tutor'. The tutor's\nreactions have been entered by the instructor previously, and give, for instance, an\nexplanation about the arguments that were used, or give a theoretical perspective. When\nthese reactions are removed from the screen, the students can engage in further discussion\nby reacting to the comments made by the 'discussion partner' in the program. They are\nable to do this by choosing from a new number of pre-programmed, multiple-choice\npossibilities. Whenever the students want to stop the discussion, they choose the option\nReady to decide... A new box will appear in which the students will type a description of\ntheir final decision (Figure 3). After this, the students are shown an explanation of the\ncase. If they want to, they can print their decision and the explanation.\nEvaluating the use of the COLADA program\nThe first author of this paper participated in, or carried out in full, various evaluations of\ndifferent cases entered into the COLADA shell. One evaluation focused on the\neducational design of the software itself, and another on student reactions to the program\nas a learning experience in ethics education. In addition, another evaluation focusing on\nthe effectiveness of the program on advancing students' levels of moral development was\nalso being carried out, and its preliminary results were made available to the authors.\nEducational design aspects of the program\nWe studied programs generated by the COLADA shell according to various features\nrelating to usability (Nielsen, 1993), user-interface design (Shneiderman, 1987), and\ninstructional design (Alessi and Trollip, 1985). These perspectives related to flexibility\nand adaptability, user-friendliness, feedback adequacy, and instructional-design choices.\n9\nMarike Hettinga and Betty Collis Ethics education and educational software\nThe evaluation is described in detail elsewhere (Hettinga, 1993a,b); some of its major\nconclusions follow.\n\u2022 The flexibility of the program is good. The contents can be varied in many ways in\nthat the instructor can in theory enter as many different cases as he or she wishes.\n\u2022 However, this content flexibility does not automatically imply that the instructional\nflexibility of the program is also good. The content may be flexible, but it must be\nentered according to a very complicated and inflexible structure. Instructors who\nwant to adapt the program to cases relevant to their specific situation will not have\nmany technical problems, but they might find the requirements of the structure itself\ntoo complicated to realize. Partly, this is because of the considerable time needed to\nthink through many different response options, each apparently representing\ndifferent stages of moral development, and to express each option in parallel form\nin a string whose length can have only limited variability.\n\u2022 From the learner's perspective, a number of aspects of the program were not user-\nfriendly. It is not always clear how one should go on in the program and the Help\nfunction needed considerable improvement. However, these points could be\nchanged within the shell program itself, with some effort.\n\u2022 The feedback options offered by the COLADA shell are good. The 'discussion\npartner' reacts first, and second (if it is requested) the 'tutor' reacts. This structure\ngives the possibility of dividing the reactions offered by the program into concrete\ncase-based reactions (given by the 'discussion partner') and abstraction reactions\n(given by the 'tutor'). The 'tutor' could for instance refer the student to relevant\nliterature. All of this potential, however, depends on the skill of the instructor in\nentering appropriate dialogue into the shell, a process (as noted above) that is time-\nconsuming and conceptually challenging.\n\u2022 The layouts of the screens are functional, but of limited visual appeal. The screen is\ndivided into a few boxes, each with a pre-determined content. This gives clarity to\nthe students. There is, however, one box which could be emphasized more. This is\nthe box at the bottom of the screen containing the possible command options. In its\ncurrent presentation, the box could be overlooked (see Figures 1,2 and 3).\nStudent evaluation of the program\nAs a second approach to evaluation, we asked a sample of six students from the Faculty\nof Business Studies at the University of Twente to work with a case entered in the\nCOLADA shell involving the production of a malfunctioning and therefore dangerous\nlaser drill. After discussing this case in the COLADA shell, they participated in an\ninterview about their reactions to the use of the program as a learning experience. We also\nasked the students to indicate if they thought they had learned something from the\nexperience. A summary of the student reactions follows; as before, a detailed review of\nthis aspect of the evaluation is available in Hettinga, 1993a,b.\n\u2022 The students thought they had strengthened their ability to discuss ethical problems\nand to find convincing arguments through the experience of interacting with the\nprogram. Besides that, the students said that the experience of the detailed dialogue\noffered by the program gave them a better idea about what ethical dilemmas really\nare and how they can be seen from different levels of development. Finally, the\n10\nALT J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nstudents indicated that they thought they had learned an approach to rational\ndiscussion which they could use in the future.\nEffectiveness evaluation\nAn additional evaluation was also carried out that looked more specifically at the effects\nof the program relative to students progressing to a higher level of Kohlberg's moral\ndevelopment. This evaluation was carried out by the developer of the program. In this\nstudy, students worked about one and a half hours with the program. A few weeks before\nand a few weeks after this session, they gave a written reaction to the same case. The\narguments of the students were analysed, and each placed in one of the six stages of\nKohlberg. This classification of arguments made it possible to compare the arguments the\nstudents used before their experience of the program and the arguments they used after\nworking with the program. This comparison showed that indeed a number of students did\nmove to a higher stage of moral development in their decisions, although the change was\nnot statistically significant (p>0.5, de Mink, 1991). A careful conclusion from this\nevaluation, which is still in progress, is that working with the program may have a\npositive effect on the students' ability to reason about moral dilemmas.\nThe THEORIA project\nTheoretical framework for the THEORIA project: the care ethic\nThe THEORIA project at the Center for the Advancement of Applied Ethics at Carnegie\nMellon University has a different theoretical background from the COLADA project.\nThe central theme in the philosophical approach underlying the THEORIA project is that\nof care for the other person (Covey, 1993). The needs of the specific person in the specific\nmoral situation is the central issue: universalization is not a goal and should even be\navoided. Instead of universal and abstract rules and values, the details of a case are of\ncritical importance.\nA central person in this theoretical approach is Carol Gilligan (1982). She claims that\nKohlberg looks at moral conflict too much from the viewpoint of rights. A moral conflict\nis in his eyes a conflict between rights. Resolving the problem is a matter of bringing up\narguments in favour of one person's rights compared to those of another. Gilligan defines\na moral problem, however, as a conflict of responsibilities involving the well-being of\npeople (Gilligan, 1982). Resolving the problem is not just the weighing of rights. One\nneeds to know the case thoroughly to decide which responsibility should be given priority\nabove another in a particular context. To get to know the case thoroughly, one should\ngather as much detail about it as possible. Following this, sensitivity to the particular\ncontext is needed. One needs to be open to the details, feelings, and emotions of those\ninvolved with regard to the situation.\nEthics education reflecting the care ethic\nEthics education based on this theoretical viewpoint should teach students how to\nempathize in cases which show a moral dilemma. Students should be taught to be\nsensitive to the details and emotions involved in a case. A requirement for ethics\neducation according to this method is, first of all cases, which offer the details and\n11\nMarike Hettinga and Betty Collis Ethics education and educational software\nemotions of a complex moral dilemma: cases with 'thick descriptions' (Rorty, 1989). A\nsecond requirement is that students should be taught how to deal with all the details and\nemotions from a case when confronted with these thick descriptions.\nVivid and thick descriptions of cases may not spontaneously bring up the possibilities of a\ncomputer as a learning resource, particularly if one's experience with educational\nsoftware has been with structured and choice-restricted shells such as COLADA.\nHowever, modern multimedia software certainly makes thick descriptions and, as a\npresented consequence, empathy possible. Within the THEORIA project various\nprograms have been designed and developed with these premises. We were involved with\ntwo of them, one during an evaluation of use in practice, and for the other, as a designer\nand developer. We will describe here the one in which we were involved in an evaluation:\n'A right to die? The case of Dax Cowart'.\n'A right to die?': multimedia software for ethics education\nThis program contains textual information as well as audio-visual material about the true\ncase of a man named Dax Cowart (User Manual, 1990). In 1973, Donald (Dax) Cowart\nsuffered burns over 65 per cent of his body, and was left blind and maimed when his car,\nparked over a leaking gas line, exploded. For 17 months, as he underwent agonizing burn\ntherapy, he pleaded with doctors and nurses to stop the treatments and let him die. Actual\nvisual footage was taken of the Dax Cowart case, including interviews with the victim, his\nfamily, and his medical attendants. This video footage has been worked into the\nmultimedia learning program.\nThe program starts with a main menu (Figure 4) from which all the sections of the\nprogram can be accessed.\nMain\nMenu\nPress one of the buttons below to proceed with\nyour investigation of Dax's case.\nYou can also \"Restart\" or \"Quit\" the program.\nAn Introduction\nShow me a brief introduction to Dax's case\nGuided Inquiries\nLet's explore the facts and issues of Dax's case.\nArchives\nLet me see the library of video segments about Dax's case.\nopen the\nNotebook\nRestart\nthis program\nQuit\nthis program\nFigure 4: The Dax case - Main Menu\n12\nALTJ VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nIssues\nMenu\nPress the buttons below to begin exploring the issues f\"T\nof Dax's case.

In addition, the\nintroduction poses the task: to come to a reasoned position on whether Dax Cowart\nshould be released from treatment to return home, in all likelihood to die, as he requests.\nThe Guided Inquiries option leads the user through the narrative and audio-visual\nmaterial. The guided tour starts with a review of the facts of the case and asks the user for\nan initial position. Second, the videos are shown. They are arranged by issue (Figure 5).\nAfter each video fragment the opportunity is given to reflect on what one has seen, and to\naffirm or revise the preliminary judgement on whether Dax should gain his release. These\nreflections help the student deal with the complexity of the case. After these video\nfragments, the student is asked to give a final position. When this position is registered, a\nfinal video segment is presented for the student to ponder. After this, the student is\nreturned automatically to the main menu.\nThe third option of the main menu is called the Archives (Figure 6). This section allows\none to move independently through the case narrative and all audio-visual material. In\nthe Archives, the user is not prompted for a position. The audio-visual materials are\norganized around the issues and principal characters of the case. The purpose of the\nArchives is to provide the means to carry out self-directed exploration of the facts and the\nissues of the case.\nEvaluation of 'A right to die?'\n'A right to die?' was also evaluated by us on its educational aspects (Hettinga, 1993b,c).\nThe following are the main findings of the evaluation.\n\u2022 The program was very user-friendly, partly thanks to the design of its graphical user\ninterface.\n\u2022 An important aspect of a large hypermedia program such as this one, is the support\noffered for navigation through the program (Reeves and Harmon, 1993). A user for\ninstance needs to know where in the program he or she is. This has been done well\nin 'A right to die?'. Besides that, the program offers the possibility of a guided tour.\n\u2022 However, another option, important for a large program (Reeves and Harmon,\n1993), is not offered by 'A right to die?'. This function is called mapping. Through a\ngraphical representation of the program - a map - the user can see where he or she\nis, and where he or she has been before. Mapping would be a positive addition to 'A\nright to die?', since the program is large and therefore a user may lose orientation.\n\u2022 Another aspect we evaluated was the screen layout. The screen design is quite good\nin 'A right to die?'. Its layout is clearly and functionally structured, and it follows a\nconsistent plan throughout.\nBased on this evaluation, we concluded that the educational-design aspects of the\nprogram are good.\nIn addition, an extensive summative evaluation of the program has been done by an\ninstructional technologist (CAAE, 1992). He compared three treatments of the case: with\ninteractive video, linear video, and with text only. At the time of writing, all the data has\n14\nALTJ VOLUME 2 NUMBER 2\nbeen gathered but the analysis has not yet been completed. The data was collected via\nquestionnaires responded to by students in courses at Carnegie Mellon where the\nsoftware is being used. The questionnaire, in addition to items relating to personal\ninformation about the respondents, included a Defining Issues Test (a standardized test\nof moral development), pre- and post-tests, videotaped think-aloud protocols, log files\nand delayed interviews.\nUsing the personal information and the pre- and post-tests, one aspect of the evaluation\nhas been analysed completely: the students' change of attitude regarding the question:\n'Should Dax be granted his request to die?' The students' attitudes indeed did change\nsignificantly. It appears, however, that there was no significant change due to the three\ndifferent treatments. The attitude changes might indicate that the students were better\nable to empathize in the case after instruction than they had been before instruction. This\nconclusion was supported by the interviews held with students. The students realized that\nthe case was much more complicated than they had thought in advance. They were\ntouched by the details and emotions of the dilemma.\nConclusion: can we combine philosophical approaches\nin one software product?\nThe description of these projects shows how valuable both kinds of educational software\ncan be for ethics education. The COLADA programs teach students how to reason about\nmoral dilemmas, and to approach these dilemmas as abstractly as possible. The\nTHEORIA programs, on the other hand, teach students to empathize in a case. Students\nshould be sensitive towards the details and emotions of a specific case. The approaches\nseem contradictory. We think, however, that both ways of dealing with a moral problem\nare necessary, both in private as well as in professional life. They are complementary.\nStudents should therefore be taught both approaches. Preferably, they should be shown\nhow to use both approaches on one and the same case.\nHow can both approaches be integrated in one program? As a starting point in answer to\nthis question, take 'A right to die?'. Abstract discussions are not included in this program.\nHow could they be added to the content? A new section should be created in which the\ntopic can be released from the specific context and discussed in abstract terms. We suggest\nthat students be asked to describe the government policy on euthanasia. What kind of\npolicy would they want and why? They can be confronted with arguments against their\npolicy. This could be done in a discussion form such as that offered by COLADA. It is\nimportant that students reflect on the way the specific case with all the details and\nemotions affects the choice of an abstract policy. The best reflection on this point would\nbe reached when students starting with the program discuss the abstract issue first. They\napproach the topic mostly by rationality; then they can be confronted with the detailed\nand rich case. At this point, their sensitivity is activated. When talking rationally and\nabstractly about the euthanasia topic, they did not realize the complexity of a real-life\ncase. Discussing the topic rationally and abstractly leaves a distance between the students\nand possible cases. However, when confronted with a real-life case, they empathize with\nit. The third part should consist of another abstract discussion about the policy on\neuthanasia. A final discussion should try to make the students aware of the differences\nbetween the abstract and the concrete, and of the ways both approaches can affect each\nother.\n15\nMarike Hettinga and Betty Collis Ethics education and educational software\nAcknowledgements\nOur thanks are due to the following individuals, who hosted the research opportunities:\nDrs Frank de Mink of the Educational Centre, University of Twente, and Dr Robert\nCavalier of the Center for the Advancement of Applied Ethics, Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity.\nNotes\n1.
