The isomer decays via a 583 keV E1 transition with a hindrance per\ndegree of K forbiddenness, f n524. This value is similar to the values measured for the N574 isotones\n134Nd and 136Sm but markedly different from that measured for 130Ba. This suggests that there is some change\nin structure across the N574 isotones and possible explanations of this feature are discussed.\n@S0556-2813~97!00302-6#\nPACS number~s!: 21.10.Re, 23.20.2g, 25.70.Gh, 27.60.1jI. INTRODUCTION\nIsomeric Ip582 states have been observed in the even-\neven N574 nuclei, 136Sm @1#, 134Nd @2#, 132Ce @3#, 130Ba\n@4#, 128Xe @5# with half-lives ranging from nanoseconds ~Xe!\nto milliseconds ~Ba, Ce!. The mode of decay of these states\ndiffers, but in 130Ba, 134Nd, and 136Sm they decay by E1\ntransitions to the 81 member of the yrast band. The transition\nrate for this decay varies by four orders of magnitude across\nthese N574 isotones. A large proportion of this variation is\ndue to the different energies of the E1 transitions since,\nwhile the energy of the isomeric state is relatively constant as\nproton number increases, the excitation energy of the yrast\n81 state decreases sharply. Nevertheless, the underlying tran-\nsition strength varies by a factor of ;40, a difference yet to\nbe accounted for.\nIn 136Sm, the properties of the band built on the Ip582\nisomeric state have been shown @6# to be consistent with a\n7\n2\n1@404# ^ 92 2@514# , Kp582 two quasi-neutron structure.\nThe E1 transition from the isomeric state to the yrast band,\nassumed to have K50, therefore has DK58 and is 7 times\nK forbidden. As Z increases across the N574 nuclei, the\ndecreasing energy of the first excited state with Ip521 in-\ndicates @7# that the deformation increases. It might therefore\nbe expected that the K-selection rule governing the E1 tran-\nsition from the isomeric state should be more important for\nthe heavier isotones, leading to a decrease in the transition\nrate of the E1 decay and a corresponding increase in the\nhindrance. This is opposite to what is observed @1#. It is\ntherefore proposed that the variation in the hindrance is due\nto a change in the underlying structure of either the isomeric\nstates themselves or of the yrast states to which the isomer\ndecays.\nIn order to get more information on this variation, the\nN574 systematics have been extended to the very neutron\ndeficient nucleus 138Gd, the highest-Z even-even nucleus in\nthe sequence which can realistically be studied using stable\nbeam\/target combinations and fusion evaporation reactions.\nThe yrast band of 138Gd has been observed previously @8#550556-2813\/97\/55~2!\/620~5!\/$10.00and, more recently, side bands were observed in a measure-\nment @9# using the EUROGAM array in conjunction with the\nDaresbury Recoil Separator. However, no information about\ndecays from isomeric states was available.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS AND RESULTS\nThe nucleus 138Gd was populated using the reaction\n106Cd(35Cl,p2n)138Gd at a beam energy of 150 MeV. The\ntime profile of the 35Cl beam, provided by the 14UD tandem\naccelerator at the Australian National University, was 2.1\nms on and 99.5 ms off, and this was incident on a 10 mg\/\ncm2 enriched ~86%! 106Cd target. The other experimental\nconditions were similar to those used in a recent experiment\n@1# to study an analogous isomeric state in 136Sm. 138Gd is\nproduced very weakly in the reaction. Statistical model cal-\nculations estimate a cross section of 4 mb, 1% of the total\nfusion cross section, with the main channels being 3p\n(138Sm!, 3pn (137Sm!, and 2pn (138Eu! with predicted cross-\nsections of 20, 58, and 65 mb respectively.\nEvent matrices of time against g-ray energy were con-\nstructed, and background subtracted time projections for the\nlowest four ground-state-band transitions in 138Gd were\nfound to have a long-lived component. Figure 1 shows the\nmeasured time spectrum for the 221 keV ~21 ! 01) and\n384 keV ~41 ! 21) transitions in 138Gd. This decay curve\nestablishes the existence of an isomer with a half-life of 6\n61 ms.\nTo deduce the coincidence relationships between g rays\nassociated with isomers, a g2g-time coincidence experi-\nment was performed with the beam chopped to arrive in 1\nms bursts, separated by 17 ms. Events which occurred within\nthe beam bursts were vetoed so that only g rays observed\nduring \u2018\u2018out-of-beam\u2019\u2019 periods were recorded. Coincident g\nrays ~time difference 620 ns! were sorted into a matrix and\nspectra gated on the ground-state-band transitions ~illustrated\nin Fig. 2! showed a 583.2 keV transition which was also\nobserved as a delayed transition in the g-time measurement\ndiscussed above. This transition is coincident with those de-\npopulating the 21, 41, 61, and 81 levels of the yrast band,620 \u00a9 1997 The American Physical Society\n55 621SYSTEMATICS OF Kp582 ISOMERS IN N574 NUCLEIbut not the 616 keV transition @9# depopulating the yrast\n101 level. The 583.2 keV g ray is therefore placed depopu-\nlating an isomeric state at an excitation energy of 2233.1\nkeV, as shown in the inset to Fig. 2. The absence of any\nother branches is consistent with Ip5Kp582, which is\ntherefore assumed.\nIII. ISOMERIC DECAY IN THE N574 ISOTONES\nIn the 136Sm @1# and 138Gd nuclei, the only observed de-\ncay of the 82 isomeric state is via an E1 transition whereas\nin 130Ba @4# and 134Nd @2#, the energy differences are such\nthat M2 and E3 decays also compete. Details of the decay of\neach of the states are given in Table I. Column 8 of the table\nFIG. 1. Time spectrum for the 221 keV 21!01 and 384 keV\n41!21g-ray transitions in the ground-state band in 138Gd. A fit to\nthe spectrum gives a half-life 661ms.shows that there is a jump by a factor of 35 in the Weisskopf\nhindrance factor (FW) for the E1 branch between 130Ba and\n134Nd.\nThe hindrance per degree of K forbiddenness ( f n) is\nlisted in column 9 and plotted as a function of Z in Fig. 3.\nf n is defined as FW1\/n where n5DK-l is the degree of\nforbiddenness and l is the transition multipolarity @10#. The\nvalue of f n for the DK58, 583 keV E1 transition in 138Gd is\n24.1, similar to the value measured for the analogous transi-\ntion in the isotones 136Sm ( f n524.9! and 134Nd ( f n\n5 26.1!. These values are approximately constant but mark-\nedly different from that measured for 130Ba ( f n 5 43.5!.\nThis is contrary to what would be expected if the heavier\nN574 nuclei are more deformed and the K-selection rule is\ncorrespondingly more rigorous.\nFIG. 2. g-ray spectrum showing transitions, in coincidence with\nthe 384 keV (41!21) transition in the ground-state band, in the\nout-of-beam time region.

M. BRUCE et al.A. Rotational K-mixing\nIn order to investigate the underlying physical processes,\nwe consider first the degree of rotational alignment in the\nground-state bands. Figure 4 shows alignments for the\nN574 Ba, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Gd nuclei @9,11\u201314#, evaluated\nwith the same reference parameters. These data show evi-\ndence of a gain in alignment at a frequency of \\v;0.35\nMeV, attributed to the alignment of a pair of h11\/2 protons\n@15#. Figure 4 suggests that in 130Ba and 132Ce there is a\nweak interaction between the ground state and s bands which\nresults in a clear backbend. For 134Nd, 136Sm, and 138Gd,\nhowever, the alignment gain is less sharp and more complex.\nThe states above and below the backbend in 130Ba and\n132Ce are therefore likely to be relatively pure whereas in the\nheavier nuclei there could be a larger degree of mixing over\nmore states.\nIn order to try and quantify this difference in the structure\nof the 81 states in the yrast bands, we have attempted to fit\nFIG. 3.

III A.\nFIG. 4. Experimental alignments for 130Ba, 132Ce, 134Nd,\n136Sm, and 138Gd. Harris reference parameters of I0517.0\n\\2 MeV21 and I1525.0 \\4 MeV23 have been used for all five\nnuclei.the observed energies of the states in the yrast band of each\nnucleus using the prescriptions developed elsewhere ~see, for\nexample, Ref. @16#!, initially using two-band mixing between\na ground and an s band. The unperturbed bands have been\nparametrized using the variable moment of inertia model\n@17# and the interaction matrix element was assumed to be\nspin independent. As an example, Fig. 5 shows the results of\nthe two-band calculation for 134Nd, where the unperturbed\nbands are shown as dashed lines and the perturbed bands as\nsolid lines. In the case of 138Gd an acceptable fit could not be\nobtained unless a third band was included, the third band\nbecoming important at spins greater than 12\\ . Table II lists\nthe results in terms of the percentage admixture of ground\nband and s band in the yrast 81 states of each of the\nN574 nuclei under consideration. The results are in qualita-\ntive agreement with the inference drawn from the alignment\nplot, namely that the yrast 81 states in 130Ba and 132Ce are\nrelatively pure whereas those in the heavier nuclei contain a\nsizeable proportion of s-band admixture, largely because of\nthe very large interaction required for the heavier cases.\nThe ground band is assumed to have K50, and the s\nband will have a distribution of K values, which can be es-\ntimated by assuming the approximation of an expansion us-\ning the Wigner d functions for rotation through 90\u00b0 @18#.\nThe values calculated for the K admixtures will depend on\nthe value of alignment, but the maximum value of K58\nadmixture ~for a pair of h11\/2 particles coupling to j510)\nwhich can be obtained is ;20%. Taken with the results of\nthe two-state mixing calculation discussed above and tabu-\nlated in Table II, this means that in 130Ba the isomer is de-\ncaying to an 81 state which contains essentially no K58\ncomponent, while in 134Nd the 81 state is approximately 4%\n(20%320%) K58 configuration. It is thus evident that the\nE1 transition from the isomeric state in 134Nd would not be\nas hindered as the corresponding transition in 130Ba. The\ndashed line on Fig. 3 shows the values of f n calculated as-\nsuming the s-band mixing listed in the last column of Table\nII. The calculations have been normalized to the empirical\nFIG. 5.

Discussion in terms of the structure of the isomeric state\nIn 128Xe and 136Sm the configuration of the isomer has\nbeen assigned @19,6# as neutrons in the 72 1@404# ^ 92 2@514#\norbitals which are near the Fermi surface at prolate deforma-\ntion. However, in the case of 130Ba two possible configura-\ntions for the isomeric 82 state have been discussed @20#, a\ntwo-proton configuration with an oblate shape and a two-\nneutron configuration with a prolate shape. The authors @20#\ndecided in favor of the neutron configuration in 130Ba\nbecause a similar state had been seen in 132Ce. However,\nthe observed deviation in the measured f n values could also\nreflect a change in configuration of the observed isomeric\nstate across the region, with the oblate state being observed\nin 130Ba and the prolate state being observed for the higher\nZ nuclei. This is a realistic possibility since nuclei in\nthis region are known @15# to exhibit g softness and calcula-\ntions suggest that for 130Ba the potential well has a lower\nminimum for an oblate shape @20# whereas the opposite is\ntrue for 136Sm @14#. A small difference in the shape of the\npotential between the N574 nuclei could be the underlying\nreason for the observed decay systematics of the isomeric\nstates.IV. CONCLUSIONS\nAn isomeric state, proposed to have Ip5Kp582 has\nbeen observed in the very neutron deficient nucleus 138Gd. It\ndecays to the yrast structure with a half-life of 661 ms. The\nhindrance per degree of forbiddenness for an E1 decay is\n24.1, close to the values measured previously in the N574\nisotones 134Nd and 136Sm , but considerably lower than that\nmeasured in 130Ba. Two possible explanations of this phe-\nnomenon have been proposed, in terms of the structure and\nshape of the isomeric state itself and of the yrast state to\nwhich it decays. While the results of the calculations out-\nlined in Sec. III A appear to support the band-mixing theory,\nthe fit may be fortuitous and the possibility of shape effects\nmust not be discounted. In order to investigate this more\nthoroughly it is necessary to confirm the configuration of the\nisomeric states in these nuclei by examining the bands built\non them, or to measure the shapes of the isomeric and\nground states.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank the technical staff of the\n14UD accelerator at the Australian National University for\nassistance during the experiment.
