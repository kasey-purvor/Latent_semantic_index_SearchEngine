Fal\u2019ko\nDepartment of Physics, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4YB, United Kingdom\nWe derive an effective two-dimensional Hamiltonian to describe the low energy electronic exci-\ntations of a graphite bilayer, which correspond to chiral quasiparticles with a parabolic dispersion\nexhibiting Berry phase 2pi. Its high-magnetic-field Landau level spectrum consists of almost equidis-\ntant groups of four-fold degenerate states at finite energy and eight zero-energy states. This can be\ntranslated into the Hall conductivity dependence on carrier density, \u03c3xy(N), which exhibits plateaus\nat integer values of 4e2\/h and has a \u201cdouble\u201d 8e2\/h step between the hole and electron gases across\nzero density, in contrast to (4n+ 2)e2\/h sequencing in a monolayer.\nPACS numbers: 73.63.Bd, 71.70.Di, 73.43.Cd, 81.05.Uw\nFor many decades, the electronic properties of a\ngraphite monolayer have attracted theoretical interest\ndue to a Dirac-type spectrum of charge carriers [1, 2,\n3, 4, 5, 6] in this gapless semiconductor [7]. Recently\nNovoselov et al. [8] fabricated ultra-thin graphitic de-\nvices including monolayer structures. This was followed\nby further observations [9, 10, 11] of the classical and\nquantum Hall effects (QHE) in such systems confirming\nthe expectations [3] of an unusual phase of Shubnikov\nde Haas oscillations and QHE plateaus sequencing, as\nmanifestations of a peculiar magneto-spectrum of chiral\nDirac-type quasiparticles containing a Landau level at\nzero energy [1].\nIn this Letter we show that quasiparticles in a graphite\nbilayer display even more intriguing properties includ-\ning a peculiar Landau level (LL) spectrum: these are\nchiral quasiparticles exhibiting Berry phase 2pi, with a\ndominantly parabolic dispersion and a double-degenerate\nzero-energy LL incorporating two different orbital states\nwith the same energy. Taking into account spin and val-\nley degeneracies, the zero-energy LL in a bilayer is 8-\nfold degenerate, as compared to the 4-fold degeneracy\nof other bilayer states and the 4-fold degeneracy of all\nLLs in a monolayer. The structure and degeneracies of\nthe Landau level spectrum in a bilayer determine a spe-\ncific sequencing of plateaus in the density dependence\nof the QHE conductivity \u03c3xy(N) which is distinguish-\nably different from that of Dirac-type quasiparticles in a\ngraphite monolayer and of non-chiral carriers in conven-\ntional semiconductor structures.\nWe model a graphite bilayer as two coupled hexagonal\nlattices including inequivalent sites A,B and A\u02dc, B\u02dc in the\nbottom and top layers, respectively. These are arranged\naccording to Bernal (A\u02dc-B) stacking [7, 12, 13], as shown\nin Fig. 1. A lattice with such symmetry supports a degen-\neracy point at each of two inequivalent corners,K and K\u02dc,\nof the hexagonal Brillouin zone [14], which coincide with\nthe Fermi point in a neutral structure and determine the\ncenters of two valleys of a gapless spectrum. At the de-\ngeneracy point, electron states on inequivalent (A\/B or\nA\u02dc\/B\u02dc) sublattices in a single layer are decoupled, whereas\ninterlayer coupling \u03b3A\u02dcB \u2261 \u03b31 forms \u2019dimers\u2019 from pairs\nof A\u02dc-B orbitals in a bilayer [solid circles in Fig. 1], thus\nA\n~\nB\n~\nB\n~\nB\nA\nA A\nB\nB B\nA\nA\npx\npy\n\u03d5\np\na a\nA\n~\n,B\nFIG. 1: Left: schematic of the bilayer lattice (bonds in the\nbottom layer A,B are indicated by solid lines and in the top\nlayer A\u02dc, B\u02dc by dashed lines) containing four sites in the unit\ncell: A (white circles), B\u02dc (hashed), A\u02dcB dimer (solid). Right:\nthe lattice of a monolayer.\nleading to the formation of high energy bands [12, 13].\nThe low energy states of electrons are described by\nH\u02c62 = \u2212 1\n2m\n(\n0\n(\npi\u2020\n)2\npi2 0\n)\n+ h\u02c6w + h\u02c6a; (1)\nh\u02c6w = \u03bev3\n(\n0 pi\npi\u2020 0\n)\n, where pi = px + ipy;\nh\u02c6a = \u03beu\n[\n1\n2\n(\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n)\n\u2212 v\n2\n\u03b321\n(\npi\u2020pi 0\n0 \u2212pipi\u2020\n)]\n.\nThe effective Hamiltonian H\u02c62 operates in the space of\ntwo-component wave functions \u03a6 describing electronic\namplitudes on A and B\u02dc sites and it is applicable within\nthe energy range |\u03b5| < 14\u03b31. In the valley K, \u03be = +1,\nwe determine \u03a6\u03be=+1 = (\u03c6(A), \u03c6(B\u02dc)), whereas in the val-\nley K\u02dc, \u03be = \u22121 and the order of components is reversed,\n\u03a6\u03be=\u22121 = (\u03c6(B\u02dc), \u03c6(A)). Here, we take into account two\npossible ways of A \n B\u02dc hopping: via the dimer state\n(the main part) or due to a weak direct AB\u02dc coupling,\n\u03b3AB\u02dc \u2261 \u03b33 \u001c \u03b3A\u02dcB (the term h\u02c6w). They determine the\nmass m = \u03b31\/2v\n2 and velocity v3 =\n(\u221a\n3\/2\n)\na\u03b3AB\u02dc\/~.\nOther weaker tunneling processes [7] are neglected. The\nterm h\u02c6a takes into account a possible asymmetry between\ntop and bottom layers (thus opening a mini-gap \u223c u).\n2For comparison, the monolayer Hamiltonian [2],\nH\u02c61 = \u03bev\n(\n0 pi\u2020\npi 0\n)\n\u2261 \u03bev (\u03c3xpx + \u03c3ypy) ,\nis dominated by nearest neighbor intralayer hopping\n\u03b3AB = \u03b3BA \u2261 \u03b30 \u001d \u03b31, so that v =\n(\u221a\n3\/2\n)\na\u03b3AB\/~.\nFor equivalent parameters in bulk graphite [7], v3 \u001c v\nin Eq. (1). Thus, the linear term h\u02c6w, which is similar\nto H\u02c61, is relevant only for very small electron momenta\n(i.e., in an electron gas with a small density at a very\nlow magnetic field) whereas the energy spectrum within\nthe interval 12\u03b31(v3\/v)\n2 < |\u03b5| < 14\u03b31 is dominated by the\nfirst term [15] in H\u02c62 producing a dispersion |\u000f| = p2\/2m,\nwhich contrasts with |\u000f| = vp in a monolayer. H\u02c61 and\nH\u02c62 form a family of Hamiltonians H\u02c6J = \u03be\nJf(|p|)\u03c3 \u00b7n de-\nscribing particles which are chiral in the sublattice space,\nwhere n = lx cos(J\u03d5)+ ly sin(J\u03d5) for p\/p = (cos\u03d5, sin\u03d5)\n[pi = pei\u03d5], and the degree of chirality is J = 1 in a\nmonolayer and J = 2 in the bilayer. It is interesting to\nnotice that quasiparticles described by the Hamiltonians\nH\u02c6J acquire a Berry phase Jpi upon an adiabatic prop-\nagation along a closed orbit, thus charge carriers in a\nbilayer are Berry phase 2pi quasiparticles, in contrast to\nBerry phase pi particles in the monolayer of graphene [3].\nAccording to the inverted definition of sublattice compo-\nnents (for which we reserve 2\u00d7 2 Pauli matrices \u03c3i [16])\nof the wave functions \u03a6\u03be=+1 and \u03a6\u03be=\u22121, quasiparticles\nin different valleys, \u03be = \u00b11 have effectively the oppo-\nsite chirality. Also, the existence of two valleys is crucial\nfor the time-reversal symmetry of the chiral Hamiltoni-\nans. In application to H\u02c62, time reversal is described by\n(\u03a01 \u2297 \u03c3x)H\u02c6\u2217 (p, B, u) (\u03a01 \u2297 \u03c3x) = H\u02c6 (\u2212p,\u2212B, u), where\n\u03a01 swaps \u03be = +1 and \u03be = \u22121 in valley space [16].\nA microscopic analysis leading to the bilayer Hamilto-\nnian H\u02c62 uses the tight-binding model of graphite and the\nSlonczewski-Weiss-McClure parameterization [7] of rele-\nvant couplings. We represent the Hamiltonian near the\ncenters of the valleys in a basis with components corre-\nsponding to atomic sites A, B\u02dc, A\u02dc, B in the valley K [14]\nand to B\u02dc, A,B, A\u02dc in the valley K\u02dc, and distinguish be-\ntween on-site energies, \u00b1 12u in the two layers,\nH = \u03be\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\n2u v3pi 0 vpi\n\u2020\nv3pi\n\u2020 \u2212 12u vpi 0\n0 vpi\u2020 \u2212 12u \u03be\u03b31\nvpi 0 \u03be\u03b31\n1\n2u\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ;\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f3\npi = px + ipy,\np = \u2212i~\u2207\u2212 eA,\nB = rotA,\n[pi, pi\u2020] = 2~eB.\nThe HamiltonianH determines the following spectrum\nof electrons in a bilayer at zero magnetic field. There are\nfour valley-degenerate bands, \u000f\u00b1\u03b1 (p), \u03b1 = 1, 2, with\n\u000f2\u03b1 =\n\u03b321\n2\n+\nu2\n4\n+\n(\nv2 +\nv23\n2\n)\np2 + (\u22121)\u03b1\n[(\n\u03b321 \u2212 v23p2\n)2\n4\n+v2p2\n[\n\u03b321 + u\n2 + v23p\n2\n]\n+ 2\u03be\u03b31v3v\n2p3 cos 3\u03d5\n]1\/2\n,\nwhere \u000f2 describes the higher-energy (A\u02dcB dimer) bands.\nThe dispersion \u000f1(p) describes low energy bands. In\nthe intermediate energy range, 12\u03b31 (v3\/v)\n2\n, u < |\u000f1| <\n\u03b31, it can be approximated with\n\u000f\u00b11 \u2248 \u00b1 12\u03b31\n[\u221a\n1 + 4v2p2\/\u03b321 \u2212 1\n]\n. (2)\nThis corresponds to the effective mass for electrons near\nthe Fermi energy in a 2D gas with density N , mc =\np\/(\u2202\u000f1\/\u2202p) =\n(\n\u03b31\/2v\n2\n)\u221a\n1 + 4pi~2v2N\/\u03b321 . The relation\nin Eq. (2) interpolates between a linear spectrum \u000f1 \u2248 vp\nat high momenta and a quadratic spectrum \u000f1 \u2248 p2\/2m,\nwhere m = \u03b31\/2v\n2. Such a crossover happens at p \u2248\n\u03b31\/2v, which corresponds to the carrier density N\n\u2217 \u2248\n\u03b321\/\n(\n4pi~2v2\n)\n. The experimental graphite values [7, 10]\ngive N\u2217 \u2248 4.36 \u00d7 1012cm\u22122, whereas the dimer band\n\u000f2 becomes occupied only if the carrier density exceeds\nN (2) \u2248 2\u03b321\/\n(\npi~2v2\n) \u2248 8N\u2217 \u2248 3.49 \u00d7 1013cm\u22122. The\nestimated effective mass m is light: m \u2248 0.054me using\nthe bulk graphite values [7, 10].\nThe 4 \u00d7 4 Hamiltonian H contains information about\nthe higher energy band \u000f2, and, therefore, is not conve-\nnient for the analysis of transport properties of a bilayer\nwhich are formed by carriers in the low energy band \u000f1.\nWe separate H into 2\u00d72 blocks, where the upper left di-\nagonal block isH11 \u2261 \u03be(12u\u03c3z+v3[\u03c3xpx\u2212\u03c3ypy]), the lower\nright diagonal block isH22 = \u2212 12\u03beu\u03c3z+\u03b31\u03c3x, and the off-\ndiagonal blocks areH21 = H12 = v\u03be(\u03c3xpx+\u03c3ypy). Then,\nwe take the 4\u00d7 4 Green function determined by H, eval-\nuate the block G11 related to the lower-band states, and\nuse it to identify the effective low-energy bilayer Hamil-\ntonian H\u02c62. Using G\n(0)\n\u03b1\u03b1 = (H\u03b1\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u22121, we write\nG =\n(\nG11 G12\nG21 G22\n)\n=\n(\nG\n(0)\u22121\n11 H12\nH21 G\n(0)\u22121\n22\n)\u22121\n\u2261 (H\u2212 \u03b5)\u22121.\nThen, we find that G11 =\n(\n1\u2212G(0)11 H12G(0)22 H21\n)\u22121\nG\n(0)\n11 ,\nso that G\u2212111 + \u03b5 = H11\u2212H12G(0)22 H21. Since |\u03b5| \u001c \u03b31, we\nexpand G\n(0)\n22 = (H22 \u2212 \u03b5)\u22121 in \u03b3\u221211 , keeping only terms\nup to quadratic in p (and therefore in pi\u2020, pi), and arrive\nat the expression in Eq. (1).\nFor low quasiparticle energies, |\u03b5| \u001c \u03b31, the spec-\ntrum determined by H\u02c62 in Eq. (1) agrees with \u000f1 (p)\nfound using the 4\u00d7 4 Hamiltonian H. Similarly to bulk\ngraphite [7, 17], the effect of h\u02c6w consists of trigonal warp-\ning, which deforms the isoenergetic lines along the direc-\ntions \u03d5 = \u03d50, as shown in Fig. 2. For the valley K,\n\u03d50 = 0,\n2\n3pi and\n4\n3pi, whereas for K\u02dc, \u03d50 = pi,\n1\n3pi and\n5\n3pi. At the lowest energies |\u03b5| < 12\u03b31 (v3\/v)2, trigonal\nwarping breaks the isoenergetic line into four pockets,\nwhich can be referred to as one \u201ccentral\u201d and three \u201cleg\u201d\nparts [17]. The central part and leg parts have minimum\n|\u03b5| = 12u at p = 0 and at |p| = \u03b31v3\/v2, angle \u03d50, re-\nspectively. For v3 \u223c 0.1v, we find (using the data in\nRef. [7]) that the separation of a 2D Fermi line into four\npockets would take place for very small carrier densities\n3\u03b31 (\n2\nv3\nv\n2\n)\npx\npy\n0 < \u03b5 <\n\u03b31 (\n2\nv3\nv\n2\n) < \u03b5 < \u03b31\n(v3v\n2\n)0 < N < 2 N*\n\u03b312\n4pih2v2N* =\n(v3v\n2\n)  < N <2 N* 8N*\nFIG. 2: Schematic of the Fermi line in the valley K, \u03be = 1,\nfor high (light shading) and low density (dark shading). Note\nthat the asymmetry of the Fermi line at valley K\u02dc, \u03be = \u22121, is\ninverted.\nN < Nc = 2(v3\/v)\n2N\u2217 \u223c 1 \u00d7 1011cm\u22122. For N < Nc,\nthe central part of the Fermi surface is approximately\ncircular with area Ac \u2248 pi\u03b52\/(~v3)2, and each leg part is\nelliptical with area Al \u2248 13Ac. This determines the fol-\nlowing sequencing of the first few LL\u2019s in a low magnetic\nfield, B \u001c Bc \u2248 hNc\/4e \u223c 1T . Every third Landau level\nfrom the central part has the same energy as levels from\neach of the leg pockets, resulting in groups of four degen-\nerate states. These groups of four would be separated by\ntwo non-degenerate LLs arising from the central pocket.\nIn structures with densities N > Nc or for strong mag-\nnetic fields B > Bc, the above described LL spectrum\nevolves into an almost equidistant staircase of levels. We\nderive such a spectrum numerically from Eq. (1) using the\nLandau gauge A = (0, Bx), in which operators pi\u2020 and pi\ncoincide with raising and lowering operators [18] in the\nbasis of Landau functions eiky\u03c6n(x), such that pi\n\u2020\u03c6n =\ni(~\/\u03bbB)\n\u221a\n2(n+ 1)\u03c6n+1, pi \u03c6n = \u2212i(~\/\u03bbB)\n\u221a\n2n\u03c6n\u22121, and\npi \u03c60 = 0, where \u03bbB =\n\u221a\n~\/(eB). In this we followed an\napproach applied earlier to bulk graphite [17] and used\nthe bulk parameters for intralayer v and interlayer \u03b31,\nvarying the value of the least known parameter v3. The\nspectrum for the valley K (\u03be = 1) is shown in Fig. 3\nas a function of the ratio v3\/v for two different fields.\nFig. 3(a) shows the evolution of the twenty lowest levels\nfor B = 0.1T as a function of v3, illustrating the above-\nmentioned crossover from an equidistant ladder at v3 = 0\nto groups of pocket-related levels.\nThe LL spectrum obtained for B = 1T , Fig. 3(b) re-\nmains independent of v3 over a broad range of its val-\nues. Hence, even in the absence of a definite value of\nv3, we are confident that the LL spectrum in bilayers\nstudied over the field range where ~\u03bb\u22121B > v3m can be\nadequately described by neglecting v3, thus using an ap-\nproximate Hamiltonian given by the first term in H\u02c62,\nEq.

In the\nlimit of valley (u = 0) and spin degeneracies [19], we\nshall refer to these states as 4-fold degenerate LLs.\nThe LL spectrum in each valley also contains two levels\nidentified using the fact that pi2\u03c61 = pi\n2\u03c60 = 0,{\n\u03b50 =\n1\n2\u03beu ; \u03a60\u03be \u2261 (\u03c60, 0);\n\u03b51 =\n1\n2\u03beu\u2212 \u03be\u03b4 ; \u03a61\u03be \u2261 (\u03c61, 0).\n(4)\nAccording to different definitions of two-component \u03a6\nin two valleys, n = 0, 1 LL states in the valley K are\nformed by orbitals predominantly on the A sites from\nthe bottom layer, whereas the corresponding states in\nthe valley K\u02dc are located on B\u02dc sites from the top layer,\nwhich is reflected by the splitting u between the lowest\nLL in the two valleys. In a symmetric bilayer (u = 0)\nlevels \u03b50 and \u03b51 are degenerate and have the same energy\nin valleys K and K\u02dc, thus forming an 8-fold degenerate\nLL at \u03b5 = 0 (here, spin is taken into account). Also,\nnote that the spectrum of high-energy LLs, Eq. (3) is\napplicable in such fields that ~\u03bb\u22121B < \u03b31\/2v. For higher\nfields the full two-band Hamiltonian H has to be used to\ndetermine the exact LL spectrum, nevertheless, the 8-fold\ndegeneracy of the zero-energy LL remains unchanged.\nThe group of 8 states at |\u03b5| = 0 (4 for electrons and\n4 for holes, Eq.(4)) embedded into the ladder of 4-fold\ndegenerate LL\u2019s with n \u2265 2, Eq. (3) is specific to the\nmagneto-spectrum of J = 2 chiral quasiparticles.

Brackets (n, \u03be) indicate LL number n and valley in-\ndex \u03be = \u00b11. In the center the predicted Hall conductivity\n\u03c3xy (center) as a function of carrier density for bilayer (solid\nline) is compared to that of a monolayer (dashed line).\nwould be reflected by the Hall conductivity dependence\non carrier density, \u03c3xy(N) shown in Fig. 4. A solid\nline sketches the form of the QHE \u03c3\n(2)\nxy (N) in a bilayer\nwhich exhibits plateaus at integer values of 4e2\/h and\nhas a \u201cdouble\u201d 8e2\/h step between the hole and elec-\ntron gases across N = 0 that would be accompanied\nby a maximum in \u03c3xx. Figure 4 is sketched assuming\nthat temperature and the LL broadening hinder small\nvalley and spin splittings as well as the splitting be-\ntween n = 0, 1 electron\/hole LL\u2019s in Eqs. (4), so that\nthe percolating states [18] from these levels would not\nbe resolved. To compare, a monolayer has a spectrum\ncontaining 4-fold (spin and valley) degenerate LLs [1],\n\u03b50 = 0 and \u03b5\n\u00b1\nn\u22651 = \u00b1\n\u221a\n2n~v\/\u03bbB shown on the r.h.s of\nFig. 4, which corresponds to Hall conductivity \u03c3\n(1)\nxy (N)\nexhibiting plateaus at (4n+ 2)e2\/h (dotted line [20]), as\ndiscussed in earlier publications [3].\nThe absence of a \u03c3xy = 0 plateau in the QHE accom-\npanied by the maximum in \u03c3xx in the vicinity of zero\ndensity is the result of the existence of the zero-energy\nLL, which is the fingerprint of a chiral nature of two-\ndimensional quasiparticles. This contrasts with a grad-\nual freeze-out of both Hall and dissipative conductivities\nin semicondutor structures upon their depletion. Hav-\ning compared various types of density dependent Hall\nconductivity, we suggest that two kinds of chiral (Berry\nphase Jpi) quasiparticles specific to monolayer (J = 1)\nand bilayer (J = 2) systems can be distinguished on the\nbasis of QHE measurements. It is interesting to note\nthat the recent Hall effect study of ultra-thin films by\nNovoselov et al. [10] featured both types of \u03c3xy(N) de-\npendence shown in Fig. 4.\nIt is also worth mentioning that the 8-fold degeneracy\nof the group of \u000f = 0 LLs in a bilayer, Eqs. (4), is quite\nunusual in 2D systems. It suggests that e-e interaction in\na bilayer may give rise to a variety of strongly correlated\nQHE states. For structures studied in Ref. 10, with elec-\ntron\/hole densities N \u223c 1012cm\u22122, such a regime may\nbe realized in fields B \u223c 10T .\nThe authors thank A.Geim, P.Kim, K.Novoselov, and\nI.Aleiner for useful discussions, and EPSRC for support.\n[1] J.W.
