Most often, the structure of these\nequations is defined by the scientist or engineer in a form that\nis perceived to be appropriate according to the physical na-\nture of the system and the current scientific paradigms in the area of\nstudy. Most of the \u201csimulation\u201d models that emerge from this ap-\nproach are very large, with many unknown parameters. Conse-\nquently, they are difficult, if not impossible, to identify, estimate, and\nvalidate in rigorous statistical terms because of problems associated\nwith over-parametrization and the lack of experimental or monitored\ndata. Unlike the situation in engineering, however, natural environ-\nmental systems, and many systems in agriculture, are not normally\nYoung (p.young@lancaster.ac.uk) and Chotai are with the Centre for Research\non Environmental Systems and Statistics, Institute of Environmental and Natu-\nral Sciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, U.K. \u00a919\n91\n21\nst\nCE\nNT\nUR\nY\nM\nED\nIA\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

As a result, their internal physical, biological,\nand ecological mechanisms are often poorly understood,\nand planned experiments that might lead to improvements\nin such understanding are either difficult or, in the case of\nenvironmental systems, even impossible to undertake.\nIncreasingly in recent years, however, the poorly defined\nnature of many environmental and agricultural systems has\nbeen recognized. It is now becoming accepted that a new\nmodeling philosophy and associated methodology is re-\nquired that acknowledges the need to quantify the uncer-\ntainty associated with the model (e.g., [1]-[3]). The Centre for\nResearch on Environmental Systems and Statistics (CRES) at\nLancaster University has been prominent in this area of re-\nsearch. This article outlines the major aspects of our ap-\nproach to stochastic modeling, as well as briefly describing\nthree studies that demonstrate the practical utility of this ap-\nproach. In particular, the article shows how parametrically\nefficient (parsimonious), low-order stochastic models can be\nproduced that reflect the dominant modal characteristics of\nthe system and can be interpreted in physically meaningful\nterms. Within the present context, the most important aspect\nof these data-based mechanistic (DBM) models is that they\nprovide an appropriate basis for advanced nonstationary or\nnonlinear signal processing, adaptive forecasting, and\nmultivariable control system design.\nUnlike data-based \u201cblack-box\u201d models, DBM models are\nrequired to have a mechanistic interpretation. Indeed, they\nare not deemed truly credible in scientific terms unless such\nan interpretation proves possible. But, unlike the situation\nwith \u201cgrey-box\u201d models, such a physically meaningful expla-\nnation is not imposed as a hypothesis prior to modeling.\nRather, it emerges from an inductive modeling procedure\nonly after the model structure has first been identified parsi-\nmoniously from a generic class of models with wide applica-\ntion potential. In this manner, prior scientific prejudice\nabout the nature and complexity of the model is avoided,\nand the resulting DBM model will normally have a structure\nand parametrization that is appropriate to the information\ncontent of the data. In this article, the generic class of mod-\nels used in DBM modeling comprises stochastic linear and\nnonlinear differential or difference equations, or their trans-\nfer function equivalents.\nDBM modeling methods were developed originally for\nthe analysis of measured time-series data, particularly in re-\nlation to the design of signal processing, forecasting, and au-\ntomatic control systems. In the early stages of modeling,\nwhen observational data are either scarce or not available,\nhowever, the same methodological tools can also be used to\nobtain reduced-order versions of the large simulation mod-\nels. The importance of reduced-order models that reflect\nthe dominant modes of system behavior is being widely rec-\nognized in many areas of application within the environmen-\ntal and agricultural sciences. For example, such models\nhave been used in the simplification of large simulation\nmodels used in climate research (e.g., [4]) and in optimal\ncontrol system design (e.g., [5]). An example of the DBM ap-\nproach to model reduction is the modeling and control of\nthe microclimate in a large horticultural greenhouse [6]\nwhere the reduced-order control model is obtained from a\nmuch larger nonlinear simulation model. A similar DBM ap-\nproach has been used to obtain linear, reduced-order ver-\nsions of the topically important \u201cglobal carbon cycle\u201d\nmodels [6], [7] used in the studies of the International Panel\non Climate Change (IPCC).\nThis article outlines the main aspects of DBM modeling,\nas well as the associated methods of signal processing,\nadaptive forecasting, and multivariable control that exploit\nsuch models.

These range from the\nmodel reduction and control application mentioned above\nthrough the modeling and control of forced ventilation sys-\ntems in agricultural buildings to the design of adaptive flood\nforecasting and warning systems.\nMethodological Background\nThe methods used in this article have been developed over\nthe past 20 years, and they cover four main areas: DBM\nmethods for modeling linear and nonlinear stochastic sys-\ntems; dominant mode analysis (DMA) leading to the com-\nbined linearization and simplification of large simulation\nmodels; unobserved component (UC) models and their use\nin the recursive estimation, forecasting, and smoothing of\nnonstationary time series; and nonminimal state space\n(NMSS) methods of control system design. All of these meth-\nods have been described in detail elsewhere, so they are\noutlined only briefly in the following subsections.\nData-Based Mechanistic Modeling\nPrevious publications (e.g., [6]-[10]) illustrate the evolution\nof the DBM philosophy and its methodological underpin-\nning. This methodological basis is heavily dependent on the\nexploitation of recursive estimation in all its forms. These\ninclude the traditional application to online and offline pa-\nrameter estimation using recursive least-squares (RLS) and\noptimal refined instrumental variable (RIV) algorithms; the\ndesign of adaptive forecasting systems using the Kalman fil-\nter (KF) algorithm; the use of recursive fixed-interval\nsmoothing (FIS) for more statistically efficient, offline\ntime-variable parameter (TVP) estimation for use in signal\nextraction; and the exploitation of FIS combined with other\nprocedures for state-dependent parameter (SDP) estima-\ntion  and  the nonparametric\/parametric  identification  of\nnonlinear stochastic systems.\nThe three major phases in the DBM modeling strategy\nare as follows:\n\u2022 Stochastic Simulation Modeling and Sensitivity Analysis\n(e.g., [2], [3], [6], [8], and the references therein). In\nthe initial phases of modeling, observational data may\nwell be scarce, so any major modeling effort will have\nto be centered on simulation modeling, usually based\ninitially on largely deterministic concepts such as dy-\nnamic mass and energy conservation. Recognizing\nthe inherent uncertainty in many environmental and\nagricultural systems, however, these deterministic\nsimulation equations can be converted into an alter-\nnative stochastic form. Here, it is assumed that the as-\nsociated parameters and inputs can be represented in\nsome suitable stochastic form such as a probability\ndistribution function (PDF) for the parameters and\ntime-series models for the inputs. The subsequent\nstochastic analysis then exploits Monte Carlo simula-\ntion (MCS) in three ways: first, to explore the propaga-\ntion of uncertainty in the resulting stochastic model;\nsecond, as a mechanism for generalized sensitivity\nanalysis (GSA) to identify the most important parame-\nters leading to a specified model behavior; and third,\nthe use of MCS in stochastic optimization.\n\u2022 Dominant Mode Analysis and Simulation Model Simpli-\nfication (e.g., [6], [7], and the references therein). The\ninitial exploration of the simulation model in stochas-\ntic terms can reveal the relative importance of differ-\nent parts of the model in explaining the dominant\nbehavioral mechanisms. This understanding of the\nmodel is further enhanced by employing a novel\nmethod of combined statistical linearization and\nmodel order reduction. This is applied to time-series\ndata obtained from planned experimentation, not on\nthe system itself, but on the simulation model that be-\ncomes a surrogate for the real system. Such DMA is ex-\nploited to develop low-order, dominant mode\napproximations of the simulation model; approxima-\ntions that are often able to explain its dynamic re-\nsponse characteristics to a remarkably accurate\ndegree (e.g., coefficients of determination > 0.999; i.e.,\ngreater than 99.9% of the high-order model output is\nexplained by the low-order model). Conveniently, the\nstatistical methods used for such linearization and or-\nder reduction exercises are the same as those used for\nthe next phase in the modeling process.\n\u2022 DBM Modeling from Real Data (see previous refer-\nences). Time-series data form the basis for stochastic\nDBM modeling. The DBM models characterize those\ndominant  modes of  the  system  behavior  that  are\nclearly identifiable from the time-series data, and un-\nlike simulation models, the efficacy of the DBM mod-\nels is heavily dependent on the quality of these data.\nThe models derived in this form normally constitute\nthe main vehicles for the subsequent design of fore-\ncasting and automatic control systems. In the case of\nconstant-parameter models, the methodological\ntools used in this final stage of DBM analysis are linear,\nconstant parameter, transfer function (TF) identifica-\ntion and estimation tools, such as optimal instrumen-\ntal variable methods (SRIV\/RIV; e.g., [11] and the\nreferences therein). These can be compared with the\nalternative and better known methods, such as those\nin the MATLAB Identification Toolbox, which are de-\nsigned specifically for backward shift operator mod-\nels and, in most cases, require concurrent estimation\nof noise model parameters (note that the RIV\/SRIV al-\ngorithms are different from the IV\/IV4 options in the\nIdentification Toolbox). In contrast, RIV\/SRIV algo-\nrithms are available for the estimation of TF models\nin all the major operators (backward shift, time de-\nrivative, and delta) and do not require concurrent es-\ntimation of a noise model. If the system under\ninvestigation is nonstationary, however, then the con-\nstant-parameter estimation is replaced by TVP esti-\n16 IEEE Control Systems Magazine October  2001\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply.\nmation [12]-[14], whereas if the system is heavily\nnonlinear, the SDP estimation allows for identification\nof the nonlinear model structure prior to final nonlin-\near parametric estimation (see [7], [9], [14]). This lat-\nter approach provides an alternative to, or a\nreinforcement of, other approaches to nonlinear mod-\neling, such as neural network and neuro-fuzzy model-\ning (e.g., [15]). It has the advantage that the resulting\nmodels are normally much less complex, of consider-\nably lower order, and more easily interpretable in\nmechanistic terms.\nDBM modeling is obviously very different from physi-\ncally based simulation modeling, but it is often confused\nwith grey-box modeling. Grey-box modeling follows the tra-\nditional hypothetico-deductive approach. Here the hypoth-\nesis is normally in the form of a much-simplified model of\nthe physical system under study, and deduction is based on\nestimating the parameters that characterize this assumed\nmodel structure from measured data. In contrast, DBM mod-\neling is inductive and commences with few prior percep-\ntions of the model form, except that it is a member of a\nsuitable, generic class of models (normally linear\/nonlinear\ndifferential equations or their discrete-time equivalents).\nMethods of statistical model structure identification and pa-\nrameter estimation are then utilized to produce a low-di-\nmensional, black-box model, within this generic class of\nmodels, that explains the data unambiguously in a statisti-\ncally efficient manner. Only then is the question of the un-\nderlying, mechanistic interpretation of the model\naddressed, as illustrated by the examples discussed later. In\nthis manner, a minimally parametrized and statistically\nwell-defined model is obtained, and the dangers of imposing\ntoo much confidence in prior assumptions about the physi-\ncal nature of the system are avoided.\nSignal Processing, Forecasting,\nand Automatic Control\nThe DBM methods were developed primarily for modeling\nsystems from normal observational time-series data ob-\ntained from monitoring exercises (or planned experimen-\ntation, if possible) carried out on the real system. Often,\nsuch time series require some form of preprocessing, and\nthis is accomplished using methods of nonstationary\ntime-series analysis based on recursive fixed-interval\nsmoothing (e.g., [11], [12], and the references therein).\nThese powerful statistical tools allow for interpolation\nover gaps in the time series; the detection of outliers; \u201csig-\nnal extraction,\u201d including the estimation and removal of\nperiodic components (e.g., seasonal adjustment); and\ntime-frequency analysis.\nThe DBM models are also in a form appropriate for\nmodel-based forecasting and control system design. Of\ncourse, any available methods can be used for these appli-\ncations. At Lancaster, however, the stochastic UC model-\ning approach based on TVP estimation provides the main\nvehicle for adaptive forecasting ([12], [13], and the\nreferences therein). Model-based automatic control sys-\ntem design is formulated within the NMSS setting, normally\nresulting in the multivariable proportional-integral-plus\n(PIP) control algorithm (see [16] and the references\ntherein). The NMSS is the most natural state-space defini-\ntion for discrete-time transfer function models, and the PIP\ncontroller provides a natural multivariable extension of\nthe conventional PI and PID controllers. In addition to pro-\nportional and integral action, it includes additional for-\nward path and feedback filters that allow for NMSS state\nfeedback, without the need for state reconstruction, thus\nenhancing robustness and closed-loop performance. Of\ncourse, the PIP controller is just one specific outcome of\nthe NMSS design concept. This concept is not only attrac-\ntive in its own right, but control algorithms that derive\nfrom it are very general in form and thus able to mimic\nother well-known design procedures, such as minimal\nstate linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG), generalized predic-\ntive control (GPC), and Smith predictor control for time-de-\nlay systems (see [17] and the references therein).\nIt should be noted that many of the time-series analysis\nand modeling procedures mentioned above and used in\nthe examples described below are contained in the\nMATLAB CAPTAIN time-series analysis and forecasting\ntoolbox, currently in the final stages of beta testing (see\nhttp:\/\/www.es.lancs.ac.uk\/cres\/captain\/).\nModeling and Control of a\nGreenhouse Microclimate\nThe literature on modeling of the microclimate in green-\nhouses is very large, with models ranging from high-order,\nnonlinear simulation models (e.g., [18]) through much sim-\npler but still physically meaningful data-based models (e.g.,\n[19]) to purely black-box models (e.g., [5]). One important\naspect of this research has been the development and use of\nmodels for the control of greenhouse microclimates (e.g.,\n[20] and the references therein). This example falls into the\nlatter category and is concerned with the modeling and au-\ntomatic control of the microclimate in the large Venlo horti-\ncultural greenhouse at the Silsoe Research Institute (SRI) in\nBedford, U.K.\nPrior to planned experimentation on the actual green-\nhouse at SRI, the control model was obtained by combined\nlinearization and order reduction analysis [6], [7], [21]. This\nwas applied to the high-order, nonlinear simulation model\nshown in Fig. 1, originally derived by scientists at SRI [18] and\nconverted to Simulink form at Lancaster. When planned ex-\nperimentation became possible, these earlier control models\nwere replaced by the equivalent TF models obtained by iden-\ntification and estimation applied to the experimental in-\nput-output data. In the final stages of the study, the control\nmodels were used to design automatic climate control sys-\ntems that were first evaluated on the full, nonlinear simula-\ntion model, prior to implementation in the greenhouse.\nOctober 2001 IEEE Control Systems Magazine 17\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply.\nTo simplify the model shown in Fig. 1, it was perturbed\nabout a number of different operating points by suitably de-\nsigned input functions. These were applied to each control\ninput in turn (i.e., the fractional valve aperture of the heat-\ning boileru t1, , the input to the mist spraying systemu t2, , and\nthe CO2 enrichment input u t3, ), and they produced climate\nperturbations defined by the internal air temperature y t1, in\n\u00b0C, the percentage relative humidity y t2, , and the CO2 con-\ncentration y t3, in ppm. The input-output perturbational data\nset obtained in this manner was then used as the basis for\nthe identification and estimation of reduced-order, dis-\ncrete-time linear models that were directly suitable for\nmodel-based PIP system design [21].\nAt the most important operating condition, the esti-\nmated reduced-order model for y t t t t\nTy y y= [ ], , ,1 2 3 , in re-\nsponse to u t t t t\nTu u u= [ ], , ,1 2 3 , takes the form of the\nfollowing discrete-time, transfer function matrix model:\ny t\nz\nz\nz\nz\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n0 0143\n1 0 9056\n0 0712 0\n0 0587\n1 0 79\n1\n1\n1\n1\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. 06\n0 7909 0\n0\n01791\n1 0 6996\n831294\n1 0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.6541 1z\nt\n\u2212\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\nu .\n(1)\n18 IEEE Control Systems Magazine October  2001\nCO2\nHumidity\nAir Temperature\n1\/s\n1\/s\n1\/s\n1\/s\n1\/s\n1\/s\n1\/s\n1\/s\n1\/s\n1\/s\n1\/s\n\u00d71\n\u00d72\n\u00d73\n\u00d74\n\u00d75\n\u00d76\n\u00d77\n\u00d78\n\u00d79\n\u00d710\n\u00d711\nWeather\nInputs\nControl\nInputs\nThermal Rad Coeffs\nHeat Trans Coeffs\nStomatal Res\nCO Model2\nLatent Heat En Ex\nEn Ex\nDerivatives\nDemux\nMux\nu1\nu2\nu3\nu4\nu5\nu6\nu7\nu8\nFigure 1.

As might be expected, the ma-\njor coupling is between the temperature and relative humid-\nity, with CO2 being almost independent of these variables.\nDespite its simplicity, the model explains the high-order\nnonlinear model response very well, with coefficients of de-\ntermination RT\n2 0 99> . (i.e., over 99% of the high-order model\nresponse explained by the low-order model). Clearly, the\ndominant modal behavior of the simulation model at this\noperating condition, which is so important for subsequent\ncontrol system design, has been captured very well. More-\nover, this model is much simpler than might be expected on\nthe basis of the full nonlinear model equations.\nFrom the DBM standpoint, it is important that the re-\nduced-order model should make good physical sense, and,\nas expected from mass and energy transfer considerations,\nthe temperature and humidity dynamics are highly coupled.\nIndeed, it is possible to associate the model (1) with the dif-\nferential equations of mass and energy transfer for this sys-\ntem (much simplified versions of the equations used to\nderive the high-order model in Fig. 1). Since the model is es-\ntimated in discrete time, however, this relationship is not\ntoo transparent. Consequently, it is better to delay our illus-\ntration of such a mechanistic interpretation to the next sec-\ntion, where a related model is estimated directly in\ncontinuous-time terms and the physical interpretation is\nmuch more obvious.\nThe high-order simulation model provided a very use-\nful vehicle for initial PIP control system design and evalu-\nation exercises [21], where it functioned as a valuable\nsurrogate for the real system before experimentation\nwas possible. Furthermore, the fact that the reduced-or-\nder models were structurally identical to those identified\nlater from the real data meant that the initial PIP control-\nler designs were also structurally similar. Note that the\ninherent stochastic nature of the DBM models is most im-\nportant in the PIP control system design process, since it\nallows for evaluation of the controller\u2019s robustness to\nuncertainty using stochastic simulations. These can be\neither single simulations with stochastic inputs or MCS\nused to assess the robustness of the control system to\nuncertainty in the model parameters (e.g., [17] and the\nreferences therein).\nNMSS control system design is straightforward and flexi-\nble in this example [21]. Once the reduced-order TF matrix\nmodel (1) has been obtained, it is converted straightfor-\nwardly to the left matrix fraction description (MFD), and\nthence to the following NMSS form:\nx Fx Gu Dy y Hxt t t d t t t+ += + + =1 1, (2)\nwhere F and u t are defined as at the bottom of the next page\nand\nG =\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n0 0143 0 0712 0\n0 0587 0 7909 0\n0 01791 831294\n0 0 0\n0 0\n. .\n. .\n. .\n0\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n0 0143 0 0712 0\n0 0587 0 7909 0\n0 01791 8\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n. .\n. .\n. 31294.\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\nH =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nD =\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\nT\n.\nHere x t = \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212[ , , , , , , , , ,y y y y y y u u ut t t t t t t t t1 2 3 1 1 2 1 3 1 1 1 2 1 3 \u2212 1\nz z zt t t\nT\n1 2 3, , , ] is the NMSS vector; u u u ut t t t\nT\n= [ ], , ,1 2 3 is the\ncontrol input vector; and y d t d t d t d t\nTy y y, , , ,[ ]= 1 2 3 is the com-\nmand input vector (the user-defined levels of the three cli-\nmate variables).

In the simplest LQ case, for example,\nquadratic cost function weighting matrices\nQ = diag[ ]111111111 100 5 25 and R = diag [ . . ]1 01 01\nproduce the SVF control law below (equation u t at the bottom\nof the next page), where the off-diagonals of the last 3 \u00d7 3\nblock in the matrix have been constrained to zero consis-\ntent with the steady-state decoupling requirement. Note\nthat the pair [ , ]F G is stabilizable by the nonminimal state\nfeedback, and, in addition, we can always find a matrix E\nsuch that the Cholesky decomposition EE QT = , ensuring\nthat the pair [ , ]F E is observable [22]. Consequently, this\nPIP-controlled system will be stable and achieve the desired\nLQ optimality.\nThe results obtained when this controller is applied to\nthe model are shown by the fine lines in Fig. 2. The re-\nsponses show some coupling between the controlled vari-\nables, with a 10% change in humidity resulting in a\ntransient error of 1\u00b0C in the internal air temperature.

Fig. 3 shows the control perfor-\nmance of each climate variable over the entire validation pe-\nriod.

For example, air temperature was less than 1\u00b0C away\nfrom the set point for 98% of the validation period. This per-\nformance easily meets the requirements of the growers.\nFinally, it should be noted that the results shown in Figs. 2\nand 3 were obtained with the simple, constant-gain,\nmultivariable controller defined above, and some improve-\nments in performance would be possible if more complex\ncontrol systems were used. For exam-\nple, further decoupling of the tempera-\nture and humidity control can be\naccomplished by exploiting a special\nform of multiobjective optimization de-\nveloped at Lancaster (e.g., [16]).

Restrictions apply.\n(e.g., [23]) or a fully adaptive PIP control system (e.g., [24]).\nThe latter would be straightforward to implement, since the\nrecursive estimation algorithms used in the modeling stage\nof the design can be easily implemented online in real time.\nHowever, the performance shown in Fig. 3 is perfectly ac-\nceptable for most practical purposes, and such added com-\nplexity is not warranted in this case.\nModeling and Control\nof Forced Ventilation Systems\nThis example is related to the previous one and concerns the\nanalysis of data from planned experiments in a large instru-\nmented chamber in the Laboratory for Agricultural Buildings\nResearch at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (for details,\nsee [25]). This chamber, shown in Fig. 4, has a volume of 9 m3\nand has been designed to represent a scale model of a live-\nstock building or greenhouse for use in experimental re-\nsearch on forced ventilation and heating in agricultural\nbuildings. The two variable inputs, ventilation rate (120-300\nm3\/h) and heating element input (0-400 W), determine the\ndominant airflow pattern within the chamber. An envelope\nchamber or \u201cbuffer zone\u201d is constructed around the test\nroom to minimize disturbance of the airflow by heat conduc-\ntion from the laboratory. A series of aluminum conductor\nheat sinks and steam generation from a water reservoir pro-\nvide the internal heat and moisture production to simulate\nanimal occupants. To gain information about the distribution\nof mass and energy in a quantitative manner, 36 temperature\nsensors and 24 humidity sensors are positioned in a three-di-\nmensional (3-D) array within the chamber.\nThe agricultural engineering literature reports a great deal\nof research on the modeling of ventilated air spaces, much of\nit based on deterministic simulation models. More recent\ndata-based modeling has been stimulated by the control vol-\nume (CV) concept of Barber and Ogilvie [26]. For example,\nBerckmans et al. [25] use least-squares methods to estimate\nthe parameters in a simple conceptual CV model of an imper-\nfectly mixed 3-D airspace from variations in ventilation rate\nand heat supply, whereas Daskalov [27] develops a model for\nmeasured temperature and humidity variations in a naturally\nventilated pig building using discrete-time TF models. To ob-\ntain the DBM model, which can be considered a natural ex-\ntension of these earlier models, the continuous-time SRIV\nestimation algorithm is used first to identify the linear TF (or-\ndinary differential equation) model between the measured\ntemperatures at the inlet, Ti, and the outlet, T. In the case of\nthe response to a step increase of the ventilation rate from 80\nto 300 m3\/h, the estimated model for the change in tempera-\nture\u2206T from the initial steady levels takes the form\n\u2206 \u2206T t s\ns s\nT ti t( )\n. .\n. .\n( )=\n+\n+ +\n+\n1959 0 089\n2962 01112\n\u03be\n(3)\nwhere s is the differential operator and \u03be t is the residual\nnoise. Fig. 5 compares the output of this model with the mea-\nsured change in the outlet temperature, and the associated\nresidual \u03be t is plotted in the lower graph. This unexplained\nresidual has a zero mean value and low variance (0.021 com-\npared with a measured variance of 2.619 for the output \u2206T\nseries; RT\n2 0 992= . ).\nThe TF model can be decomposed into a parallel or feed-\nback connection of first-order processes, but the latter has\nmore physical significance, as required in DBM modeling.\nThis becomes clear if we invoke the classical theory of heat\ntransfer and formulate the differential equations of dynamic\nheat transfer, bearing in mind the need to arrive at a sec-\nond-order, lumped, differential equation with a TF similar to\n(3). Such analysis [28] yields the following equations for the\nmain chamber and the buffer zone:\nMain Chamber:\nd T\ndt\nT K T Ti\n( )\u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206= + \u2212\u03b2 \u03b11 1 1buff\nBuffer Zone:\nd T\ndt\nK T K T T\n( )\n( )\n\u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206buff buff buff= \u2212 + \u22122 3 .\nIn these equations,\n\u03b2 1\n1\n=\nV\nvol\n; \u03b1\n\u03b31 1\n1 1\n1 1 1\n= +\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nV k\nvol\nsf\nvol cp\n; K\nk\n1\n1 1\n1 1 1\n=\nsf\nvol cp\u03b3\n;\nK\nk\n2\n2 2\n2 1 1\n=\nsf\nvol cp\u03b3\nand\nK\nk\n3\n1 1\n2 1 1\n=\nsf\nvol cp\u03b3\nwhere T is the temperature (\u00b0C) measured at the outlet\nport but assumed to be representative of the temperature\nin the active mixing volume (AMV) [10];Ti is the temperature\nOctober 2001 IEEE Control Systems Magazine 21\nFigure 4.

Note also that the conventionally defined\nheat transfer parameters used in the above mechanistic for-\nmulation of the equations are not identifiable from the\nabove relationships. In contrast, the parameters of the\nmodel (4) have direct physical significance, and they can be\nidentified fully from the measurements obtained in the\nchamber experiments. Consequently, this model is not only\nuseful in subsequent control system design terms, but it\nalso provides an alternative, mechanistic characterization\nof the heat transfer dynamics that is useful in its own right.\nThe above model is currently being used in the design of a\nmultivariable PIP controller for a chamber similar to that de-\nscribed in the previous section. However, other associated\nresearch has been concerned with the modeling and control\nof the fans used in the forced ventilation systems. Fig. 6, for\nexample, is a diagram of the fan test installation at Leuven.\nThe model for this system is identified by the SRIV algorithm\nas a first-order discrete time TF, and this model has been used\nas the basis for PIP and GPC system design. This study con-\nfirms that the model-based control algorithms offer better\nperformance than the conventional PID controller in terms of\nboth the regulation of ventilation rate and the reduction of\nenergy consumption. In particular, for a 450-mm axial fan, the\nnormalized mean square errors are as follows: PIP = 1, GPC =\n1.64, PID = 5.59. These results were obtained for an airflow\nrate of 3000 m3\/h with realistic wind disturbances, but, in or-\nder to evaluate their practical robustness, all three control-\nlers were optimized for an airflow rate set point in the\nneighborhood of 1500 m3\/h, without wind.\nEnvironmental Forecasting\nPrevious publications from Lancaster illustrate how the\nmodeling and forecasting procedures outlined above have\nbeen applied to environmental and other time series (e.g.,\n[13] and the references therein).

As shown, the trendTt is identified as\na polynomial in time t, with unknown but constant parame-\nters, combined with a residual signal dt that models the me-\ndium-term, stochastic deviations about this polynomial\ntrend. The annual seasonality is modeled by the periodic\ncomponent Ct : this is of a standard trigonometric (Fourier)\nform but with stochastically time-varying parameters (TVPs)\na b jj t j t, ,, , ,=1 2. This type of relationship will model any peri-\nodic behavior defined by the frequencies\u03c9 j j, ,=1 2, and the\nTVPs allow for the estimation of changes in the amplitude\nand phase of these seasonal variations. In the present CO2\nexample, the frequency \u03c9 \u03c01 2 12= \/ is the fundamental fre-\nquency associated with the 12-month seasonal cycle, and\n\u03c9 \u03c02 2 6= \/ is its first harmonic. The spectrum of the data sug-\ngests that the other harmonics are insignificant and can be\nomitted. The TVPs dt , a b jj t j t, ,, , ,=1 2 in this UC model are\nidentified and modeled as simple random walk processes in\nan associated set of stochastic state equations (see [13]).\nThe hyper-parameters (e.g., noise variance ratios) in this\nstate-space model are estimated by a special form of optimi-\nzation in the frequency domain (see [12] and [13]) and the\nrecursive KF and FIS algorithms are then used for forecast-\ning, backcasting, and interpolation of the series.\nTypical results are shown in Figs. 9 and 10.

The top panel\nin Fig. 9 shows the two-year interpolation results, whereas\nthe lower panel shows the three-year-ahead forecasts. In\nboth cases, the results are excellent, with very small errors\nbetween the interpolates\/forecasts (full lines) and the data\n(dashed lines, not used in the analysis). The estimated stan-\ndard error bounds (95% confidence intervals) are shown as\ndotted lines. Fig. 10 shows the last 5.5 years of the\n14.4-year-ahead forecast. Here, the data (again not used in\nthe estimation or forecasting) are plotted as circular points\nand the forecast as a solid line, with the standard error\nbounds shown dotted. Given the very long\nforecasting interval, these results are quite\nremarkable and show how predictable this\nimportant series can be if sufficiently pow-\nerful forecasting algorithms are used. As far\nas the authors are aware, these are the best\nforecasting results produced so far for this\nseries.\nAdaptive Flow Forecasting\nin the Ribble Catchment\nOnce again, the scientific literature\nabounds with different models of rain-\nfall-flow processes in river catchments.\nThese vary considerably in complexity\nfrom those based on continuum mechanics\n(solved approximately via finite difference\nor finite element spatiotemporal discre-\ntization methods) [29] through conceptual\nmodels such as TOPMODEL [30] to hy-\nbrid-metric-conceptual (HMC) grey-box\nmodels such as IHACRES (e.g., [31]), which\nare similar in structure and complexity to\nthe DBM model equivalent [32]. The main\naim of the River Ribble study [33] was\nthreefold: first, to obtain DBM models relat-\ning rainfall to the river flows measured in\nthe Ribble catchment; second, to evaluate\nthe performance of a state-adaptive,\nKF-based approach to forecasting, with\nthe state dynamics defined by these DBM\nmodels; and finally, to compare this\nstate-adaptive approach with its predeces-\nsor at Lancaster, the parameter-adaptive\nforecasting system developed for the Sol-\nway River Purification Board as a flood\nwarning system for the town of Dumfries in\nScotland (e.g., [34]). Another, secondary\nobjective following from the development\nof the Lancaster adaptive radar calibration (ARC) system\nfor the National Rivers Authority\/Environment Agency\n[35] was to consider how well forecasting performance\nusing weather radar measured rainfall compared with the\nperformance using more conventional ground-based\nmethods.\nIn the case of a uniform sampling interval of one hour,\nSRIV identification and estimation yields the following dis-\ncrete-time TF model between the gauged rainfall rt and the\nmeasured flow yt for the River Hodder at Hodder Place in the\nRibble catchment during December 1993:\ny\nb b z\na z a z\ng rt t t=\n+\n+ +\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n0 1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2 41\n{ } \u03be .\n(7)\n24 IEEE Control Systems Magazine October  2001\n335\n330\n325\n1971 1971.5 1972 1972.5 1973 1973.5 1974 1974.5\nCa\nrb\non\n D\niox\nid\ne \n[pp\nm]\nCa\nrb\non\n D\niox\nid\ne \n[pp\nm]\nInterpolation and Forecasting Results\n355\n350\n345\n340\n1985 1985.5 1986 1986.5 1987 1987.5 1988 1988.5\nDate\nFigure 9.

Restrictions apply.\nHere, g rt{ }\u2212 4 is a nonlinear function of the rainfall delayed by\nfour sampling intervals to introduce the pure (advective)\ntime delay between the occurrence of the rainfall and its\nfirst measured effect on the river flow. The noise level on\nflow data is normally quite large, and the noise term \u03be t is in-\ntroduced here to reflect the combined effects of measure-\nment noise, unmeasured disturbances, and imperfections\nin the model.\nIn this case, SDP estimation shows that a rainfall\nnonlinearity is present and takes the form\nu g r c f y rt t t t\u2212 \u2212 \u2212= = \u22c5 \u22c54 4 4{ } { } (8)\nwhere ut is termed the \u201ceffective rainfall\u201d (or \u201crainfall ex-\ncess\u201d) and c is a scale factor chosen conventionally so that\nthe volume of the effective rainfall is equal to the total\nstream flow volume over the estimation period. Equation\n(8) shows that the rainfall affects the flow via a multiplica-\ntive nonlinearity between rt\u2212 4 and a nonlinear function of\nflow f yt{ }, where yt is acting as a surrogate for the soil mois-\nture, which is difficult to measure [9]. The estimated nonlin-\near function shows that the SDP is small for low flows (low\nsoil moisture) and increases, but with diminishing slope, for\nhigh flows. Consequently, the effective rainfall is lower than\nthe actual rainfall for low soil moisture, since it tends to be\nabsorbed by the dry soil under these conditions. At high\nflow (high soil moisture), however, the rainfall is much more\neffective in inducing flow variations.\nBased on this SDP identification analysis and subsequent\nparametric estimation, the rainfall-flow nonlinearity is\nparametrized using a power law f y yt t{ } =\n\u03b8 to approximate\nf yt{ }. The SRIV estimates of the associated parameters, as\nwell as the TF parameters, are shown in Table 1. This also in-\ncludes some parameters that are derived from decomposi-\ntion of the TF model into the following parallel connection of\ntwo first-order processes (e.g., [9]):\nb b z\na z a z z z\n0 1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n11 1 1\n+\n+ +\n=\n+\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1 (9)\nwhere \u03b1 \u03b2i i iand , ,=1 2 are, respectively, the eigenvalues of\nthe TF denominator and the associated residues in the par-\ntial fraction expansion of the TF. The latter define the\nweighting or \u201cpartitioning\u201d associated with this decomposi-\ntion. It is clear from (8) and (9) that the effective rainfallut\u2212 4\ncan be partitioned into two parallel pathways resulting in\ntwo component flows that, when added together, yield the\ntotal measured river flow. In effect, therefore, the decompo-\nsition provides estimates of two \u201cunobserved\u201d (\u201clatent\u201d or\n\u201chidden\u201d) flow states and their associated rainfall-flow dy-\nnamics.\nThe estimates in Table 1(b) reveal that the two pathways\nhave very different dynamics. The \u201cquick-flow\u201d pathway has\na total travel time (Ti + \u03b4) of 7.5 hr, whereas the \u201cslow-flow\u201d\npathway has a total travel time of 77 hr. The associated par-\ntition percentages of 60% and 40%, respectively, suggest\nthat more of the effective rainfall affects the quick-flow path-\nway than the slow-flow pathway. Note, however, that if the\nuncertainty in the parameter estimates is taken into ac-\ncount using MCS analysis (see previous discussion and [8]),\nthen some of the derived parameters in Table 1 have wide\nconfidence intervals and non-Gaussian distributions. In par-\nticular, and not surprisingly, the slow-flow dynamics are\nmuch more poorly defined than the quick-flow dynamics.\nAs we have stressed, an important aspect of DBM model-\ning is the physical interpretation of the model. Given the de-\nrived parameters in Table 1, the most obvious physical\ninterpretation of the model (9) is that the effective rainfall af-\nfects the river flow nonlinearly via two main pathways. First,\nthe initial rapid rise in the hydrograph, following an instanta-\nneous rise in effective rainfall, derives from the quick-flow\npathway, probably as the aggregate result of the many sur-\nface processes active in the catchment. The subsequent long\ntail in the recession of the hydrograph is associated mainly\nwith the slow-flow component, probably as the result of wa-\nter displacement within the groundwater system.\nFor flow forecasting purposes, the complete catchment\nmodel for the River Ribble is formulated in terms of rain-\nfall-flow models such as (7), together with flow-flow TF mod-\nels that route the flow down the river system. All of these TF\nmodels are then combined into a set of stochastic state\nequations with a state vector x t . In the case of the rain-\nfall-flow models, such as (7), the associated state variables\nare defined as the latent states defined by decompositions\nsuch as (9), and the rainfall inputs are the effective rainfall\nseries, such asut .

The\nresulting four-step-ahead forecasting results are obtained\nfrom the prediction step in the KF update equations and are\nshown graphically in Fig. 11.\nThe forecasting performance shown in Fig. 11 can be im-\nproved a little if the noise \u03be t in (7) is modeled as an AR pro-\ncess and introduced into the state-space description (thus\nincreasing its dimension to include the additional stochas-\ntic states). Even without this improvement, however, the\nperformance is good, and this is reflected in the statistical\nproperties of the forecast errors, which have a mean value\nnear zero (0.0032 mm\u22c5hr-1) and a standard deviation\n\u03c3e 4 0132= . mm\u22c5hr\n-1.

The advantages of this inductive approach to mod-\neling lie in its wide range of applicability. It can be used to\nmodel linear, nonstationary, and nonlinear stochastic sys-\ntems, and its exploitation of recursive estimation means\nthat the modeling results are useful for both online and\noffline applications. To demonstrate the practical utility of\nthe various methodological tools that underpin the DBM ap-\nproach, the article also outlined several typical,\npractical examples in the area of environmental and\nagricultural systems analysis, where DBM models\nhave formed the basis for simulation model reduc-\ntion, control system design, and forecasting. How-\never, the same methods have been used in many\nother applications in diverse areas of science and\nsocial science. Recent applications include:\n\u2022 Engineering: the delta operator modeling and\nautostabilization of the Harrier VSTOL aircraft\nin its most difficult transitional mode between\nhovering and normal flight [7], [16], the model-\ning and control of interurban traffic systems\n[38], and both model reduction and control of\nan industrial gasifier system [39].\n\u2022 Ecology: the modeling of limit cycling behav-\nior in blowfly population dynamics [7], [14].\n\u2022 Biology: DBM modeling has revealed new as-\npects of the dynamics associated with\nstomatal behavior in plants [40]; the chaotic\nelectrical activity in the axon of a squid has\nalso been modeled [41], [42].\n\u2022 Business Data Analysis and Forecasting: UC modeling\nand forecasting of microeconomic and business data\nfor the credit card company Barclaycard, U.K. [43]\n\u2022 Macroeconomics: where DBM modeling yields some\nthought-provoking, and rather topical, insights into\nthe relationship between government spending, pri-\nvate capital expenditure, and unemployment in the\nUnited States between 1948 and 1998 [44].\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to the United Kingdom Biotechnol-\nogy and Biological Sciences Research Council for its sup-\nport, through Research Grants 89\/E06813 and 89\/MMI09731,\ntogether with the Ph.D. studentship 98\/B1\/E\/04226.
