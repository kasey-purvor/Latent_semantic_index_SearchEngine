It has long been known that in the case of inflation models\ndriven by an F-term, SUGRA corrections generate a Hubble scale inflaton mass which\nspoils the flatness of the inflaton potential [1]. Elimination of such corrections is\npossible in F-term hybrid inflation [2], but only if there is a significant suppression\nof the higher-order terms in the Ka\u00a8hler potential [3]. In contrast, D-term hybrid\ninflation models [4] automatically evade Hubble corrections and are therefore naturally\ncompatible with SUGRA.\nHowever, there are problems with D-term inflation. Minimal D-term inflation ends\nwith a phase transition which produces local cosmic strings [5]. WMAP observations\n[6] bound the contribution of local cosmic strings to the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) power spectrum to be less than about 10% [7], which results in an upper bound\non the cosmic string tension which excludes minimal D-term inflation unless the gauge\nand superpotential couplings are suppressed [8, 9, 10]. In addition, the latest 3-year\nWMAP value of the spectral index, ns = 0.958\u00b10.016 (1-\u03c3) [6], is significantly smaller\nthat the minimal D-term inflation prediction, ns = 0.983.\nD-term inflation has two distinct regimes corresponding to large and small cou-\nplings. If we consider unsuppressed gauge and superpotential couplings then the CMB\npower spectrum is completely dominated by the cosmic string contribution. However,\nif we consider small superpotential and gauge couplings ( <\u223c 10\n\u22125 and 10\u22122 respectively)\nthen it is possible to suppress the cosmic string contribution to O(10)% [9, 10]. (Sim-\nilar but somewhat less restrictive upper bounds were obtained in [11].) The adiabatic\ndensity perturbation from inflation in this case has ns = 1. However, the addition\nof the cosmic string contribution can lower the apparent spectral index of the CMB\nsufficiently for it to be consistent with the observed value [11, 12, 13]. This may allow\nminimal D-term inflation to be consistent with the observed CMB, but at the cost of\nsmall couplings 1. In the following we will consider the case of unsuppressed gauge\n1A alternative approach has recently been suggested in [14].\n1\nand superpotential couplings. In this case, if minimal D-term inflation is correct, it\nshould be modified to reduce both the string tension and the spectral index.\nHow can this be achieved within a well-motivated framework? A possible solution\nwas proposed in [15]. In general, the minimal D-term inflation model should be consid-\nered as a sector of a complete theory which also includes the Minimal SUSY Standard\nModel (MSSM), extended to include neutrino masses (\u03bdMSSM). In this case, mod-\nification of the minimal D-term inflation model could come from corrections due to\n\u03bdMSSM sector fields. In the context of see-saw neutrino masses, it was shown in [15]\nthat a SUGRA correction due to the F-term energy density of a RH sneutrino field\ncan lower both the string tension and spectral index. In this model, RH Sneutrino-\nModified (RHSM) D-term inflation, it was found that if the RH sneutrino field is in\nthe range (0.1-1)M (M = MP l\/\n\u221a\n8pi) and has mass of the order of (0.1-1)HI , where\nHI is the Hubble parameter during inflation, then it is possible to satisfy the CMB\nupper bound on the string tension for values of the spectral index that are within the\nlower bound from WMAP. This provides the only example of a minimal D-term hy-\nbrid inflation model with unsuppressed couplings that is consistent with the observed\nCMB. However, the analysis of the RHSM D-term inflation model given in [15] was\nrestricted to the case where inflaton-sector SUGRA corrections are negligible and the\nslow-rolling RH sneutrino field can be treated as a constant. The purpose of this paper\nis to generalise this analysis.\nSUGRA corrections to minimal D-term inflation without RH sneutrino modifica-\ntion were considered in [16]. Although these allowed a reduction of both the string\ntension and the spectral index, it was shown that such corrections cannot lower the\nstring tension sufficiently to be consistent with the observed CMB [10]. Here we\nwill show that once RH sneutrino modification is included, such corrections can sub-\nstantially increase the range of spectral index for which RHSM D-term inflation is\nconsistent with the observed CMB.\nThe RHSM D-term inflation model also provides a well-motivated example of a\ntwo-field inflation model. In order to study the effects of two-field inflation we will\napply the \u03b4N method [17, 18]. We will show how such effects modify the string tension\n2\nand spectral index and determine the conditions under which the RH sneutrino field\nmay be treated as constant.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we review the original RHSM D-\nterm inflation model and update WMAP and cosmic string bounds to take account\nof recent developments. In Section 3 we consider the effect of combining SUGRA\ncorrections from the inflaton sector fields with the RH sneutrino correction. In Section\n4 we apply the \u03b4N method to study two-field inflation effects of the inflaton-RH\nsneutrino system and establish the conditions under which the constant RH sneutrino\nfield approximation is valid. We also compute the running spectral index due to the\nevolution of the RH sneutrino field. In Section 5 we present our conclusions.\n2 RH Sneutrino-Modified D-term Inflation\nThe superpotential of the RHSM D-term inflation model is given by [15]\nW =WD +W\u03bd . (1)\nWD is the superpotential of minimal D-term hybrid inflation [4],\nWD = \u03bbS\u03a6+\u03a6\u2212 , (2)\nwhere S is the inflaton superfield and \u03a6\u00b1 are superfields charged under the U(1)FI\ngauge symmetry responsible for the Fayet-Iliopoulos term. W\u03bd is the superpotential\nof the see-saw neutrino mass model [19]\nW\u03bd = \u03bb\u03bd\u03a6HuL+\nm\u03a6\n2\n\u03a62 , (3)\nwhere \u03a6 is the RH neutrino superfield, Hu and L are the Higgs and lepton superfield\ndoublets and m\u03a6 is the RH neutrino mass. In this we have suppressed generation\nindices. The scalar potential of minimal D-term inflation in global SUSY limit is\nV (S,\u03a6+,\u03a6\u2212) = \u03bb\n2\n[\n|S|2\n(\n|\u03a6+|2 + |\u03a6\u2212|2\n)\n+ |\u03a6+|2 |\u03a6\u2212|2\n]\n+\ng2\n2\n(\n|\u03a6+|2 \u2212 |\u03a6\u2212|2 + \u03be\n)2\n,\n(4)\n3\nwhere \u03be is the Fayet-Iliopoulos term. Inflation occurs when |S| > |S|c = g\u03be1\/2\/\u03bb, in\nwhich case \u03a6+ and \u03a6\u2212 are equal to zero at the minimum of the potential as a function\nof |S|. The evolution of the inflaton is then determined by the 1-loop potential [10]\nV (S) = Vo+\ng4\u03be2\n32pi2\n[\n2 ln\n( |S|2\n\u039b2\n)\n+ (z + 1)2 ln\n(\n1 + z\u22121\n)\n+ (z \u2212 1)2 ln\n(\n1\u2212 z\u22121\n)]\n, (5)\nwhere Vo = g\n2\u03be2\/2 and z = \u03bb2|S|2\/g2\u03be. The effect of SUGRA, assuming a minimal\nKa\u00a8hler potential, is to replace |S|2 by |S|2e|S|2\/M2 , where M = MP l\/\n\u221a\n8pi [10]. At\n|S| = |S|c there is a U(1)-breaking phase transition, ending inflation and producing\nlocal cosmic strings.\nIn [15] a Ka\u00a8hler potential consisting of minimal kinetic terms and an interaction\nbetween S and \u03a6 was considered,\nK = S\u2020S + \u03a6\u2020\u03a6+\ncS\u2020S\u03a6\u2020\u03a6\nM2\n. (6)\nIn the limit where |S|2 \u226a M2 and z \u226b 1, which requires that g <\u223c 0.1, the SUGRA\ninflaton potential is well-approximated by the global SUSY potential,\nV (S) = Vo +\ng4\u03be2\n16pi2\nln\n( |S|2\n\u039b2\n)\n. (7)\nFor |\u03a6|2\/M2 \u226a 1, the RH sneutrino potential is given by the global SUSY F-term,\nV (\u03a6) = |F\u03a6|2 = m2\u03a6|\u03a6|2 . (8)\nExpanding the SUGRA potential in |S|2\/M2, the leading-order effect of c 6= 0 is to\nintroduce a potential interaction between S and \u03a6 [15],\n\u2206V = \u2212(c\u2212 1)m\n2\n\u03a6|\u03a6|2|S|2\nM2\n. (9)\nThe scalar potential in the limit g <\u223c 0.1 is therefore given by [15]\nV (s, \u03c6) = Vo +\n\u03b1\n2\nln\n(\ns2\n2\u039b2\n)\n\u2212 \u03bas\n2\u03c62\n4\n+\nm2\u03a6\u03c6\n2\n2\n, (10)\n(s =\n\u221a\n2Re(S), \u03c6 =\n\u221a\n2Re(\u03a6)) where2\n\u03b1 =\ng4\u03be2\n8pi2\n, \u03ba =\n(c\u2212 1)m2\u03a6\nM2\n.\n2The definition of \u03ba used here differs from that in [15] by a factor |\u03a6|2.\n4\nIn general Eq. (10) describes a two-field inflation model. In [15] it was assumed that the\nslow-rolling \u03a6 field could be considered constant if m\u03a6 is sufficiently small compared\nto H , in which case the standard single-field inflation analysis of density perturbations\ncan be applied. In this case Eq. (9) is effectively a negative inflaton mass squared when\nc > 1. The solutions for the slow-rolling inflaton field, spectral index and curvature\nperturbation can then be calculated analytically3:\ns2(t) = s2o\n(\n1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b3\n)\n, (11)\nns = 1\u2212 \u03b3\nN\n(\n1\n(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b3) + 1\n)\n, (12)\nand\nP\u03b6 =\nN\u03be2\n3M4\n1\n\u0393\n; \u0393 =\n\u03b3e\u22122\u03b3\n(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b3) , (13)\nwhere\n\u03b3 = \u03baN\u03c62\/3H2 . (14)\nThe value of \u03be1\/2 required to account for the observed curvature perturbation, P\n1\/2\n\u03b6 =\n4.8\u00d7 10\u22125, is then\n\u03be1\/2 = 7.9\u00d7 1015\u03931\/4\n(\n60\nN\n)1\/4\nGeV . (15)\nThese solutions only depend on a single parameter, \u03b3. As a result, it is possible to\neliminate \u03b3 and express \u03be1\/2 as a function of ns, allowing the model to be directly\ncompared with CMB bounds on the cosmic string tension and spectral index [15].\n2.1 Updated bounds on RHSM D-term inflation\nSince [15] was published there have been developments in both the 3-year WMAP\nspectral index bound [6] and the CMB upper bound on the cosmic string tension [13]:\n\u2022 In the latest version of the 3-year WMAP analysis [6], the 1-\u03c3 mean value of the\nspectral index using \u2019WMAP only\u2019 data is given as ns = 0.958\u00b10.016, compared with\nthe first version value ns = 0.951\n+0.015\n\u22120.019. The 1-\u03c3 mean value from \u2019WMAP + ALL\u2019\n3The form of the potential in this limit has also been analysed in [20] and [21] as \u2019hilltop inflation\u2019.\n5\nother data sets is given as ns = 0.947\u00b1 0.015. We will compare our results with both\nof these ranges.\n\u2022 In [13] a new value was obtained for the l = 10 WMAP normalised cosmic string\ntension \u00b5, G\u00b5 = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22126, based on a field-theory simulation of the cosmic string\nnetwork. (The cosmic string tension in D-term inflation is given by \u00b5 = 2pi\u03be [5].) We\nwill compare our model with this new value.\nIn Figures 1 and 2 we display upper limits of 10% and 5% on the contribution\nof local cosmic strings to the CMB, based on the normalised \u00b5 of [13]. In this case\nthe upper bounds on \u03be1\/2 are 3.9 \u00d7 1015 GeV (10%) and 3.3 \u00d7 1015 GeV (5%). In\n[15] an earlier 10% upper bound from [8] was used, \u03be1\/2 < 4.6 \u00d7 1015 GeV. In the\nfollowing we will consider a model to be consistent with the observed CMB if the\ncosmic string contribution is less than 5% and ns from the inflationary adiabatic\nspectrum is compatible with WMAP bounds 4.\nIn Figure 1 we show \u03be1\/2 as a function of the adiabatic RHSM D-term inflation\nspectral index ns. In Figure 1(a) we show the 1- and 2-\u03c3 upper and lower bounds on\nns based on \u2019WMAP only\u2019 data. In Figure 1(b) we show the bounds on ns for the case\nof \u2019WMAP + ALL\u2019 data sets. In the case of \u2019WMAP only\u2019 data, the spectral index is\nconsistent with the 10% cosmic string upper bound if we consider the 2-\u03c3 lower bound\non ns, but not if we consider the 1-\u03c3 lower bound. In the case of \u2019WMAP + ALL\u2019, the\ncosmic string upper bound is also marginally consistent with the 1-\u03c3 lower bound. For\nthe 5% cosmic string upper bound, the spectral index is generally inconsistent with\n\u2019WMAP only\u2019 data, but is compatible with the 2-\u03c3 lower bound for \u2019WMAP + ALL\u2019.\nIn Figure 2 we show the range of \u03b3 as a function of ns required to fit the WMAP\nbounds. In general \u03b3 of order 1 is necessary to significantly modify ns and \u03be\n1\/2.\nThis requires that 0.1M <\u223c |\u03a6| < M and 0.1H <\u223c M\u03a6 < H , where the upper bounds\nfollow from the requirements of (i) small SUGRA corrections to the \u03a6 potential and\n(ii) a slow-rolling \u03a6 field [15]. The value of H during inflation is given by HI \u2248\ng \u00d7 2.1\u00d7 1012 GeV (using \u03be1\/2 \u2248 3.5\u00d7 1015 GeV), so with g \u2248 0.1 the required order\n4A more detailed analysis based on combining the adiabatic and cosmic string CMB power spectra\nand comparing with WMAP data will be the subject of future work.\n6\n(a) WMAP data only.\n(b) WMAP + ALL data.\nFigure 1: \u03be1\/2 as a function of ns in the original RHSM D-term Inflation model.

However, the above analysis is restricted to the\ncase where:\n(i) The only significant SUGRA correction is that coming from the non-minimal Ka\u00a8hler\ninteraction between S and \u03a6.

We now consider the Ka\u00a8hler potential [16, 10]\nK = |S|2+|\u03a6+|2+|\u03a6\u2212|2+ cS\n\u2020S\u03a6\u2020\u03a6\nM2\n+f+\n( |S|2\nM2\n)\n|\u03a6+|2+f\u2212\n( |S|2\nM2\n)\n|\u03a6\u2212|2+b |S|\n4\nM2\n, (16)\nwith\nf\u00b1\n( |S|2\nM2\n)\n=\nc\u00b1|S|2\nM2\n\u2261 c\u00b1\n2\ns2\nM2\n.\nWith c 6= 0 the full potential is given by adding RH sneutrino corrections to the c = 0\nSUGRA inflaton potential derived in [10]:\nV (s, \u03c6) =\ng2\u03be2\n2\n{\n1 +\ng2\n16pi2\n[\n2 ln\n(\ng2\u03bez\n\u039b2\n)\n+ fV (z)\n]}\n\u2212 \u03bam\n2\n\u03c6s\n2\u03c62\n4\n+\nm2\u03c6\u03c6\n2\n2\n, (17)\nwhere\nfV (z) = (z + 1)\n2 ln\n(\n1 +\n1\nz\n)\n+ (z \u2212 1)2 ln\n(\n1\u2212 1\nz\n)\nand\nz \u2261 \u03bb\n2s2\n2g2\u03be\nexp\n(\ns2\n2M2\n+ b\ns4\n4M4\n)\n1\n(1 + f+)(1 + f\u2212)\n.\nIn Figures 3 and 4 we show \u03be1\/2 as a function of ns obtained by numerically solving\nthe s field equation with constant \u03c6 and using the standard single-field inflation results\nfor ns and P\u03b6 [22]. We compare these results with the most recent \u2019WMAP only\u2019 and\n\u2019WMAP + ALL\u2019 bounds on ns and with the 10%, 5% and 1% cosmic string upper\nbound on \u03be1\/2. We fix c = 2 throughout.\nFigure 3 shows results for g = 0.6, c+ = c\u2212 = 3.0 and b ranging from 0.0 to\n3.0. The line labelled \u2019SUSY limit\u2019 is the case without additional SUGRA corrections,\ncorresponding to the original RHSM D-term inflation model with potential Eq. (10).\nFrom Figure 3(a) (WMAP only data) we find that a cosmic string contribution less\nthan 5% is compatible with the 2-\u03c3 WMAP lower bound on ns for all b > 0 and with\nthe 1-\u03c3 bound for b > 3.0. From Figure 3(b) (WMAP + ALL data) a cosmic string\ncontribution less than 5% is compatible with the 1-\u03c3 WMAP lower bound for all b > 0.\nFigure 4 shows results for b = 1.0, c+ = c\u2212 = 3.0 with g ranging from 0.4 to 1.0.\nFrom Figure 4(a) (WMAP only) we find that a cosmic string contribution below 5%\n9\n(a) WMAP only\n(b) WMAP + ALL data\nFigure 3: c+ = c\u2212 = 3.0, g = 0.6 plot of \u03be\n1\/2 versus ns for b = 0.0, 1.0 and 3.0.\n10\n(a) WMAP only\n(b) WMAP + ALL data\nFigure 4: c+ = c\u2212 = 3.0, b = 1.0 plot of \u03be\n1\/2 versus ns for g = 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0.\n11\nFigure 5: c+ = c\u2212 = 3.0, b = 1.0 plot of |S|2\/M2 at N = 60 versus g for ns = 0.93,\n0.94 and 0.95.\nFigure 6: c+ = c\u2212 = 3.0, b = 1.0 plot of \u03b3 as a function of g for ns = 0.93, 0.94 and\n0.95.\n12\nis compatible with the WMAP 2-\u03c3 lower bound on ns for g > 0.4, but would require\ng > 0.6 to be compatible at 1-\u03c3. From Figure 4(b) (WMAP + ALL) a 5% cosmic\nstring contribution is compatible with 2-\u03c3 bounds for all g, and is compatible with\n1-\u03c3 bounds for all g > 0.6. The case g = 1 is easily compatible with 1-\u03c3 bounds, in\nwhich case the cosmic string contribution is in the range 1-5%. The spectral index is\nns\n<\n\u223c 0.968 for a cosmic string contribution less than 5%.\nThus combining additional SUGRA corrections with RH sneutrino modification\nallows the minimal D-term inflation model to be completely compatible with WMAP\nobservations of the CMB. A sufficiently small cosmic string contribution and values of\nns larger than the WMAP lower bounds can be obtained for reasonable values of g,\nc\u00b1 and b.\nIn the figures we have considered relatively large values of g. We must check that\nthe value of |S|2\/M2 is small enough that we can expand the Ka\u00a8hler potential in\npowers of |S|2\/M2. In Figure 5 we show |S|2\/M2 at N = 60 as a function of g. For\nthe range of values of g of interest, |S|2\/M2 is sufficiently small that higher-order\nSUGRA corrections to V (s, \u03c6) will not have a large effect.\nIn Figure 6 the value of \u03b3 at N = 60 is shown as a function of g. Values of \u03b3\nbetween 1 and 2.5 are required to achieve sufficient modification of the potential.\nThe cosmic string contribution is generally larger than about 1% for the parameters\nwe have considered. Therefore we can expect to observe the cosmic string contribution\nas the precision of CMB observations improves. In addition, the 5% cosmic string\nupper bound on \u03be1\/2 requires values of ns less than 0.968 for g \u2264 1, with smaller\nvalues for smaller cosmic string contributions. These may be regarded as predictions\nof the RHSM D-term inflation model.\n4 Two-field Inflation Effects\nRHSM D-term inflation is a two-field inflation model based on s and \u03c6. Therefore the\nfinal adiabatic perturbation and spectral index will depend on the evolution throughout\ninflation of the adiabatic and isocurvature field, which will be linear combinations of s\n13\nFigure 7: Two-field inflation trajectories for m\u03a6\/H = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6. Values of\nN are shown on the trajectories.\nand \u03c6 [23]. (Field trajectories for a range of m\u03a6\/H are shown in Figure 7.) Since the\nRH sneutrino field will decay well before the inflaton field, the final perturbation will\nbe purely adiabatic. However, the adiabatic curvature perturbation will be determined\nby the full history of the adiabatic and isocurvature scalars from horizon exit during\ninflation. In this case the usual single-field expressions for the spectral index and\ncurvature perturbation will no longer apply. The results of the previous sections are\nbased on the assumption that \u03c6 is sufficiently slowly rolling that the model can be\ntreated as a single-field inflation model, with the value of \u03c6 fixed to its value at horizon\nexit. In this section we will establish the conditions under which this \u2019constant \u03c6\u2019\napproximation is good and how the results are modified by its breakdown. Since our\nconcern here is to show how two-field inflation effects modify the single-field results,\nwe will focus on the simpler example of the original RHSM D-term inflation model\ndefined by the potential Eq. (10).\nTo estimate the effect of two-field inflation we will apply the \u03b4N method [17, 18].\nThe curvature perturbation between superhorizon-sized patches at two different points\nin space is given by the difference in the number of e-foldings of inflation experienced\nby the two patches from an initial flat slicing where the fields have assigned values until\n14\na final slicing which has a fixed value of \u03c1. We will calculate the curvature perturbation\nwhen the density equals \u03c1c, corresponding to the value of \u03c1 for the unperturbed fields\nwhen the phase transition at s = sc ends inflation. Although it is possible that there\ncould be further evolution of the curvature perturbation and \u03b4N after inflation, we\nexpect that most of the effect of the RH sneutrino field on the curvature perturbation\noccurs during inflation. The curvature perturbation is then given by [17, 18]\n\u03b6(tc,x) = \u03b4N = N(\u03c1c, s(x), \u03c6(x))\u2212N(\u03c1c, si, \u03c6i) . (18)\nHere s(x), \u03c6(x) are the perturbed initial values of the fields relative to the unperturbed\ninitial fields si and \u03c6i, and tc is the time at which inflation ends for the unperturbed\nfields.\nTo lowest-order, the shift in the number of e-foldings will be given by\n\u03b4N =\n\u2202N\n\u2202si\n\u03b4si +\n\u2202N\n\u2202\u03c6i\n\u03b4\u03c6i , (19)\nwhere N \u2261 N(si, \u03c6i) is the unperturbed number of e-foldings at the end of inflation,\nN(si, \u03c6i) =\n\u222b tc\nti\nH(t; si, \u03c6i)dt (20)\nand \u03b4si and \u03b4\u03c6i are the initial quantum fluctuations at horizon exit. The power\nspectrum of the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation is then\nP\u03b6 =\n(\n\u2202N\n\u2202si\n)2\nP\u03b4s +\n(\n\u2202N\n\u2202\u03c6i\n)2\nP\u03b4\u03c6 (21)\nwhere P\u03b4s = P\u03b4\u03c6 = (H\/2pi)\n2.\nWe have computed the derivatives \u2202N\/\u2202si and \u2202N\/\u2202\u03c6i by perturbing the initial\nconditions and solving the full s and \u03c6 field equations based on Eq. (10) until \u03c1 equals\nthe same value \u03c1c as in the unperturbed case. The initial si and \u03c6i and the value of\n\u03be1\/2 were chosen to give N = 60 unperturbed e-foldings, a correctly normalized P\u03b6\n(P\n1\/2\n\u03b6 = 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22125) and a fixed value for \u03b3 calculated from Eq. (14). This allows us\nto directly compare the \u03b4N results with the constant \u03c6 results for ns and P\u03b6, which\ndepend only on the value of \u03b3.\n15\nIn Table 1 we give values of the derivatives of N with respect to s and \u03c6 as a\nfunction of m\u03a6\/H . In this we have fixed \u03b3 = 1, g = \u03bb = 0.1 and c = 2. From\nthis we see that the contribution of (\u2202N\/\u2202\u03c6i)\n2 to P\u03b6 is negligible. Therefore quantum\nfluctuations of the RH sneutrino field will have a negligible effect on the curvature\nperturbation.\nm\u03a6\/H \u2202N\/\u2202si \u2202N\/\u2202\u03c6i\n0.05 1443.7 18.8\n0.2 970.6 39.1\n0.4 757.3 29.3\n0.6 717.9 21.5\n0.8 705.2 16.6\n1.0 699.8 13.4\nTable 1: \u2202N\/\u2202si and \u2202N\/\u2202\u03c6i as a function of m\u03a6\/H .\nThe effect of the time evolution of the classical \u03c6 field is seen by increasing the\nvalue of m\u03a6\/H . In Figure 8(a) we show the ratio \u03be\n1\/2\/\u03be1\/2o as a function of m\u03a6\/H ,\nwhere \u03be1\/2o = 7.9 \u00d7 1015 GeV is the value in conventional minimal D-term inflation\nwithout RH sneutrino modification. In Figure 8(b) we show the spectral index as a\nfunction of m\u03a6\/H .\nFrom Figure 8(a) there is a very strong effect on the value of \u03be1\/2 from the time\nevolution of \u03c6. For m\u03a6\/H = 0.2, the suppression of \u03be\n1\/2 has become significantly\nweaker than in the case of constant \u03c6, by a factor 0.83 as compared with 0.67. For\nm\u03a6\/H\n>\n\u223c 0.5, the value of \u03be\n1\/2 is almost unaltered from the minimal D-term inflation\nmodel without RH sneutrino modification.\nFrom Figure 8(b) we see that the reduction of the spectral index from the constant\n\u03c6 case is much less sensitive than \u03be1\/2 to m\u03a6\/H . For m\u03a6\/H = 1.0 we find that\nns = 0.968, which is still a significant suppression compared with the unmodified\nD-term inflation value, ns = 0.983.\nIn Figure 9 we show the running spectral index, \u03b1 = dns\/d ln k. For small m\u03a6\/H ,\n\u03b1 tends towards a small negative value which is consistent with the constant \u03c6 value\n16\n0 . 6 5\n0 . 7\n0 . 7 5\n0 . 8\n0 . 8 5\n0 . 9\n0 . 9 5\n1\n0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1\nm\nf\nH\nx\nx\no\n1 \/ 2\n1 \/ 2\n(a) \u03be1\/2\/\u03be\n1\/2\no vs. m\u03a6\/H\n0 . 9 5 6\n0 . 9 5 8\n0 . 9 6 0\n0 . 9 6 2\n0 . 9 6 4\n0 . 9 6 6\n0 . 9 6 8\n0 . 9 7 0\n0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1\nm\nf\nH\nn\ns\n(b) Spectral index vs. m\u03a6\/H\nFigure 8: Effect of \u03c6 time evolution on \u03be1\/2\/\u03be1\/2o and ns.\n17\n- 0 . 0 0 1\n 0 . 0 0 0\n 0 . 0 0 1\n 0 . 0 0 2\n 0 . 0 0 3\n 0 . 0 0 4\n 0 . 0 0 5\n 0 . 0 0 6\n 0 . 0 0 7\n 0 . 0 0 8\n 0  0 . 1  0 . 2  0 . 3  0 . 4  0 . 5  0 . 6  0 . 7  0 . 8  0 . 9  1\nm\nf\nH\na\nFigure 9: Running spectral index \u03b1 as a function of m\u03a6\/H .\nobtained from Eq. (12), \u03b1 = \u22120.00026. As m\u03a6\/H increases, \u03b1 increases to positive\nvalues, with \u03b1 = 0.0024 for m\u03a6\/H = 0.5 and \u03b1 = 0.008 for m\u03a6\/H = 1.0. These are\nmuch larger than and of opposite sign to the value in conventional hybrid inflation\nmodels, \u03b1 = \u22121\/N2 = \u22120.00028, and may be large enough to be observable in the fu-\nture. The values of m\u03a6\/H for which \u03b1 is larger than 0.001 are too large to significantly\nsuppress the cosmic string contribution to the CMB, but they are consistent with a\nsignificant suppression of ns relative to the value in conventional D-term inflation and\nso could be important in non-minimal D-term inflation models without cosmic strings\n[24]. Thus a positive \u03b1 > 0.001 combined with ns smaller than 0.983 would be a\nsignature of non-minimal D-term inflation with RH sneutrino modification.\nFor the results of the constant \u03c6 approximation to be reasonable we should restrict\nto m\u03a6\/H\n<\n\u223c 0.1. In this case we need to check if it is still possible for the RH sneutrino\nto modify D-term inflation when |\u03a6|2\/M2 is small compared with 1. For example,\nif we require \u03b3 \u2248 1 in order to sufficiently modify ns and \u03be1\/2 then Eq. (14) with\n18\nm\u03a6\/H\n<\n\u223c 0.1 implies that\n|\u03a6|2\nM2\n=\n3H2\u03b3\n2 (c\u2212 1)m2\u03a6N\n>\n\u223c\n2.5\n(c\u2212 1) . (22)\n|\u03a6|2\/M2 should be sufficiently small to keep SUGRA corrections to the RH sneu-\ntrino potential under control. For example, c = 8 and m\u03a6\/H \u2248 0.1 require that\n|\u03a6|2\/M2 \u2248 0.35. Therefore relatively large values of c are required. The RH sneu-\ntrino modification for a given |\u03a6|2\/M2 can be enhanced by the effect of additional RH\nsneutrino generations. In the idealized case where all three generations have the same\nmass and expectation value, the value of |\u03a6|2\/M2 will be smaller by a factor of 3 for\na given c and m\u03a6\/H , thus allowing smaller values of c.\nSince |\u03a6|2\/M2 is generally not very small compared with 1, SUGRA corrections\nto the RH sneutrino potential could become significant. In fact, such corrections\ncould help to enhance RH sneutrino modification. For example, if the leading order\ncorrection to V (\u03c6) has a negative sign, so flattening V (\u03c6) at large \u03c6, then it is possible\nthat the rate of roll of the RH sneutrino could be smaller than in the case of a \u03c62\npotential for a given value of V (\u03c6). This would allow the constant \u03c6 approximation\nto hold even if the RH sneutrino mass was not very small compared with H .\n5 Conclusions\nWe have shown that including SUGRA corrections allows the RH sneutrino-modified\nvariant of minimal D-term inflation to be consistent with CMB bounds on the spectral\nindex even when the CMB contribution from cosmic strings is small. The value of ns\nis predicted to be low, less than 0.968 when g \u2264 1.0 for a cosmic string contribution\nless than 5%, while cosmic strings are expected to contribute at least 1% to the CMB\npower spectrum for g \u2264 1. The combination of low spectral index plus greater than\n1% percent CMB cosmic string contribution may be regarded as a prediction of the\nRH sneutrino-modified D-term inflation model.\nWe have anaylsed the model as a two-field inflation model using the \u03b4N method.\nThe main two-field inflation effect is from the time evolution of the classical RH sneu-\n19\ntrino field, with quantum fluctuations of the RH sneutrino field having a negligible\neffect on the curvature perturbation.\nTwo-field inflation effects strongly diminish the RH sneutrino suppression of the\ncosmic string tension once m\u03a6\/H\n>\n\u223c 0.2, in which case the model will violate CMB\nbounds on cosmic strings. However, the effect on RH sneutrino suppression of the\nspectral index is smaller, which may be significant for D-term inflation models which\nevade cosmic string formation but still have a large spectral index. For m\u03a6\/H\n<\n\u223c 0.1\nit is a good approximation to treat the model as a single-field inflation model with\nconstant \u03c6.\nThe running spectral index in the limit m\u03a6\/H < 0.1 is negative and of the same\nmagnitude as in conventional hybrid inflation models, \u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.0002. For largerm\u03a6\/H ,\n\u03b1 increases to positive values due to the rolling of the \u03a6 field. Values of \u03b1 greater than\n0.008 are found for m\u03a6\/H > 1.0. For these values of m\u03a6\/H there is no significant\nsuppression of the CMB contribution from cosmic strings. However, the spectral index\nis still reduced relative to conventional D-term inflation, so a large positive \u03b1 could\noccur in non-minimal D-term inflation models without cosmic strings. Observation of\na positive running spectral index together with a reduced spectral index may therefore\nprovide a signature of non-minimal D-term inflation with RH sneutrino modification.\nIn conclusion, we have shown that RH sneutrino-modified D-term inflation pro-\nvides a version of the original minimal D-term inflation model which is completely\nconsistent with CMB observations. The model requires no suppression of couplings\nand no additional fields beyond those that already exist in the minimal D-term infla-\ntion model and the MSSM with neutrino masses. It therefore provides a predictive\ncandidate for SUGRA inflation with all the advantages of conventional D-term infla-\ntion with respect to naturalness. RH sneutrino modification can also play a role in\nbringing non-minimal D-term inflation models without cosmic strings into agreement\nwith the observed spectral index.\n20\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported (in part) by the European Union through the Marie Curie Re-\nsearch and Training Network \u201dUniverseNet\u201d (MRTN-CT-2006-035863) and by STFC\n(PPARC) Grant PP\/D000394\/1.\nReferences\n[1] E.J.Copeland, A.R.Liddle, D.H.Lyth.
