Further efforts to understand how mental toughness 13 \ndevelops are encouraged. With recent advances in instruments to measure mental 14 \ntoughness, further quantitative research is deemed appropriate. The efficacy of proposed 15 \nmethods of enhancing mental toughness such as environmental manipulations, and 16 \nmental skills training approaches need to be evaluated if the gap between theoretical 17 \nresearch and practice is to be bridged.  18 \n 19 \n 20 \n21 \n 3 \nIntroduction 1 \n Although the concept of mental toughness in sport is not new, and applied texts 2 \ndevoted to the development of mental toughness have existed for some time (i.e. Bull, 3 \nAlbinson, & Shambrook, 1996; Goldberg, 1998; Loehr, 1986, 1995), it was not until 4 \nrelatively recently that more rigorous scientific approaches to the study of this important 5 \nconstruct have been evident (Jones, Hanton, & Connaughton, 2002, 2007). The surge in 6 \nresearch interest clearly indicates the importance which sport psychologists, coaches 7 \nand athletes attach to the concept of mental toughness because of the potential 8 \nrelationship with successful performance (cf. Crust, 2007).  9 \n In the past decade, scientific evidence has ostensibly led to a greater 10 \nunderstanding of mental toughness, although agreement concerning the 11 \nconceptualisation, definition, and development of mental toughness has been slow to 12 \nemerge. Bull, Shambrook, James, and Brooks (2005, p211) take a pragmatic stance by 13 \naccepting the conceptual ambiguities which are, \u2018bound to exist when trying to establish 14 \nall encompassing definitions of mental toughness in sport\u2019. As research interest appears 15 \nto be increasing there is a need to evaluate progress and to focus research efforts to 16 \nenable efficient acquisition of new knowledge.  17 \n This paper aims to review mental toughness research, re-examine some of the 18 \nunderlying conceptual and methodological issues, identify gaps in the knowledge 19 \ndomain and provide appropriate direction for future researchers. With apparent 20 \nincreased knowledge of what mental toughness is (Clough, Earle, & Sewell, 2002; 21 \nJones et al., 2007), the associated attributes of mentally tough performers (Fourie & 22 \nPotgieter, 2001; Jones et al., 2002) and emerging evidence of how mental toughness is 23 \ndeveloped and maintained (Bull et al., 2005; Connaughton, Wadey, Hanton, & Jones, 24 \n2008), there is a need to carefully consider how research should proceed.  25 \n 4 \nReplication or Innovation?  1 \nIn relation to the study of anxiety in sport, Nesti (2004) suggested future researchers 2 \nfaced an important decision: to continue using the same methods and asking the same 3 \nquestions, thereby essentially replicating past research; or choose new approaches in an 4 \nattempt to advance knowledge. With a plethora of research studies using qualitative 5 \nmethods and elite athletes from either generic athletic samples or mainstream sports to 6 \nidentify the attributes of mentally tough athletes (Bull et al., 2005; Fawcett, 2005; 7 \nFourie & Potgieter, 2001; Gordon, Gucciardi, & Chambers, 2007; Jones et al., 2002, 8 \n2007; Thelwell, Weston, & Greenlees, 2005) it is reasonable to consider the value of 9 \npursuing this particular line of enquiry. It will be presently argued that researchers need 10 \nto adopt more innovative approaches to the study of mental toughness. Just as mentally 11 \ntough athletes seek challenges and are focused on personal growth, mental toughness 12 \nresearchers need to embrace the challenge to be innovative, rather than continue to 13 \nreplicate past research; or as Maddi (2004) might suggest, have the courage to choose 14 \nthe future rather than the past. 15 \nDominant Perspectives  16 \nThe work of Jones et al. (2002; 2007) has undoubtedly made a significant 17 \ncontribution to the current understanding of mental toughness in sport. In contrast to 18 \nprevious investigations, these studies demonstrated a more rigorous, scientific approach. 19 \nJones et al. (2002, 2007) studied mental toughness within the guiding framework of 20 \npersonal construct theory (Kelly, 1955) and employed qualitative methods using elite, 21 \nand super elite performers (Olympic gold medallists and world champions) from a 22 \nvariety of sports. To their credit, these researchers also included coaches and sport 23 \npsychologists within their sample in order to gain a broader perspective. A three-stage 24 \nprocedure was adopted in both studies which progressed from a small focus group 25 \n 5 \n(three participants), to individual interviews and follow-up interviews to confirm the 1 \ndefinitions of mental toughness and the attributes of mentally tough performers that 2 \nemerged during the initial stages of the research. Jones et al. (2007, p. 247) defined 3 \nmental toughness as: 4 \n Having the natural or developed psychological edge that enables you to, 5 \n generally, cope better than your opponents with the many demands 6 \n (competition, training, lifestyle) that sport places on a performer and, 7 \n specifically, be more consistent and  better than your opponents in remaining 8 \n determined, focused, confident, and in control under pressure. 9 \n   Jones et al. (2007) reported thirty attributes of mental toughness which were 10 \npresented within four separate dimensions. These four dimensions consisted of Attitude 11 \n\/ mindset (belief, focus), Training (using long-term goals as the source of motivation, 12 \ncontrolling the environment, pushing yourself to the limit), Competition (handling 13 \npressure, belief, regulating performance, staying focused, awareness and control of 14 \nthoughts and feelings, controlling the environment) and Post-competition (handling 15 \nfailure, handling success).  16 \n The definition and conceptualisation of mental toughness proposed by Jones et 17 \nal. appears to have achieved significant support from other researchers who have 18 \nadopted similar qualitative approaches, and studied elite, mainstream sports participants 19 \n(Bull et al., 2005; Thelwell et al., 2005). However, it is necessary to be cognisant of 20 \nfindings that offer alternative perspectives on mental toughness, as previous research 21 \nhas not universally supported the findings of Jones et al. Despite advances, a number of 22 \ntheoretical and methodological issues require greater clarification.  23 \nLimitations and Theoretical Problems  24 \n 6 \nWhile the work of Jones et al. clearly moves towards a more thorough, 1 \nmultidimensional understanding and conceptualisation of mental toughness, criticisms 2 \nremain. Crust (2007) highlighted concerns with using small numbers in the initial focus 3 \ngroup stage of the research, since researchers and theorists have consistently 4 \nrecommended between 6 and 8 participants in focus group research (Bloor, Frankland, 5 \nThomas, & Robson, 2001). Such group sizes enable individuals to sufficiently challenge 6 \none another, as well as re-consider and re-evaluate their own positions in order to move 7 \nbeyond individual interpretations (Kitzinger, 1995). While it could be argued that the 8 \ncomprehensive nature of the second and third stages of the Jones et al. (2002; 2007) 9 \nresearch negates such concerns, the focus group itself does appear rather limited, given 10 \nthat it is the foundation of the research.  11 \n Furthermore, it could be argued that the emerging attributes of mental toughness 12 \nare little different to those found previously (Loehr, 1995; Fourie & Potgieter, 2001). 13 \nAnother concern, highlighted by Middleton et al. (2004a) is that the definition of mental 14 \ntoughness presented by Jones et al. does not represent what mental toughness is, but 15 \nrather what mental toughness can allow athletes to do. There is also an underlying 16 \nassumption that elite and super elite participants will be mentally tough, with no 17 \nobjective measure of mental toughness attempted to verify this. Jones et al. (2007) 18 \njustify their approach on the basis that mental toughness should be related to successful 19 \noutcomes, and interestingly because \u2018there is no validated measure of mental toughness\u2019 20 \n(p.244). Given that a number of instruments have been developed to measure mental 21 \ntoughness, and have been found to be valid and reliable (MT48 \u2013 Clough et al., 2002), 22 \nand possess adequate psychometric properties (PPI-A \u2013 Golby, Sheard, & van Wersch, 23 \n2007) this statement is inaccurate and misleading. Finally, despite the research being 24 \n 7 \nguided by personal construct theory, the work is not underpinned by any extant theories 1 \nof personality or development. 2 \n While the work of Jones et al. (2002; 2007) has sought to address the conceptual 3 \nweaknesses of previous studies, and thus reduce the conceptual confusion, ambiguity 4 \nand contradictions of previous work, there is an alternative view that has been 5 \noverlooked: such problems in previous research might, in part, have been a reflection of 6 \nindividual difference and the fact that the term \u2018mental toughness\u2019 may have various 7 \nidiosyncratic meanings to different athletes in different sports (cf. Fawcett, 2005). 8 \nWhile numerous attributes have been found to consistently represent mental toughness 9 \n(cf. Crust, 2007) in a variety of settings, other attributes are less frequently reported and 10 \nare not consistent with the findings of Jones et al. (i.e. mental self-concept, religious 11 \nconvictions, task familiarity, ethics, self-knowledge, patience, flexibility, and 12 \nsociability).  13 \n Little attention appears to have been given to the proposal of Bull et al. (2005), 14 \nwho suggested different forms of mental toughness, and differentiated between \u2018final 15 \nputt\u2019 or pressure mental toughness; \u2018endurance\u2019 mental toughness or mental toughness 16 \nin relation to heavy training schedules; and mental toughness in circumstances of 17 \nextreme physical danger. While an over-arching framework of mental toughness, with 18 \ncentral attributes has recently been presented (Jones et al., 2007), in practical terms, the 19 \nmental toughness required of a snooker player is not likely to be congruent to that of a 20 \nrower, or a mountaineer. If the ultimate outcome is to intervene and help athletes to 21 \ndevelop higher levels of mental toughness, it would appear that ignoring such 22 \ndifferences is to the detriment of knowledge development, and this is dangerous as it 23 \nmight lead researchers down a metaphoric \u2018blind alley\u2019.       24 \n 8 \n Another problem with the dominant conceptualisation of mental toughness is the 1 \npredominant focus on elite and super elite sports participants and coaches (i.e. Bull et 2 \nal., 2005; Fourie & Potgieter, 2001; Jones et at., 2002; 2007; Thelwell et al., 2005). The 3 \nimplicit assumption seems to be that successful athletes must be mentally tough without 4 \nany attempt to objectively evaluate the mental toughness of participants. It is quite 5 \nconceivable that for many of the participants, that physical characteristics, abilities, or 6 \nphysiological factors were more influential in relation to success. Jones et al. (2007, p. 7 \n244) are quick to acknowledge that because their own definition of mental toughness 8 \n\u2018contains a dimension that relates to successful outcomes, mental toughness should be 9 \ninvestigated in a sample of athletes who have achieved ultimate success in their 10 \nrespective sports\u2019. While it is easy to agree that mental toughness includes an outcome 11 \ndimension, it is difficult to conceive why mental toughness should only be studied with 12 \nelite or super elite participants. This approach would appear restrictive given that 13 \nsuccessful outcomes are perhaps more appropriately conceived in relative, rather than 14 \nabsolute terms, reflecting what Bull et al. (2005) revealed as a \u2018determination to make 15 \nthe most of ability\u2019. Similarly, Loehr (1995) defined mental toughness in relative terms, 16 \ndescribing the ability to consistently perform toward the upper range of ones talent and 17 \nskill, regardless of competitive circumstances. Since athletes all have differing levels of 18 \nability, conceiving mental toughness in absolute, rather than relative terms appears to be 19 \nproblematic.  20 \n Furthermore, the definition of mental toughness presented by Jones et al. (2002; 21 \n2007) is not consistent with concepts such as self-efficacy, which emphasise the need 22 \nfor other non-psychological prerequisites when considering the relationship with 23 \nsuccessful outcomes (Bandura, 1986). Previous mental toughness researchers have also 24 \nstressed the importance of both psychological and physical prerequisites (Fourie & 25 \n 9 \nPotgieter, 2001). Although using elite and super elite performers to study mental 1 \ntoughness has intuitive appeal, there is a danger that mental toughness erroneously 2 \nbecomes a concept only attributable to such athletes.  3 \nQualitative and Quantitative Research 4 \nIn moving towards a clearer understanding of mental toughness it is important to 5 \nconsider the future role of qualitative and quantitative investigations. Undoubtedly, 6 \nqualitative research methods have a significant role to play in acquiring knowledge of 7 \nhow mental toughness develops. However, while qualitative research has been 8 \ninstrumental in providing rich, descriptive interpretations, and have revealed mental 9 \ntoughness to be multidimensional, future researchers should also be encouraged to 10 \nemploy quantitative approaches to examine perceptual, affective, cognitive, and 11 \nbehavioural differences between athletes with differing levels of mental toughness. 12 \nExperimental research investigating aspects of the conceptualisation of mental 13 \ntoughness such as decision-making under pressure, performance consistency, or risk 14 \ntaking are becoming increasingly necessary. Indeed, in viewing the progress of related 15 \nresearch from health psychology, the importance of quantitative research is evident in 16 \nestablishing relationships between hardiness and variables such as, blood pressure, self-17 \ncare, coping, and performance (cf. Maddi, 2004).  18 \n Research by Clough and colleagues (Clough et al., 2002; Crust & Clough, 2005; 19 \nLevy, Polman, Clough, Marchant, & Earle, 2006) using the MT48 and MT18 20 \nquestionnaires has already established various perceptual and behavioural differences 21 \nbetween participants with self-reported varying levels of mental toughness (cf. Crust, 22 \n2007). Furthermore, other researchers such as Golby and colleagues (Golby, Sheard, & 23 \nLevallee, 2003; Golby & Sheard, 2004), and Gucciardi, Gordon, and Dimmock (2007) 24 \nhave also begun to move the study of mental toughness forwards by employing 25 \n 10 \nquantitative methods. However, given that the predominant approach appears to be the 1 \nuse of self-report questionnaires, future researchers should look to use multi-source 2 \nmeasures of mental toughness to help reduce the likelihood of socially desirable 3 \nresponding. Encouragingly, recent research in Australian football, comparing self-4 \nreported mental toughness to coach and parent evaluations using the authors own 5 \nAustralian Football Mental Toughness Inventory, found no evidence that football 6 \nplayers were giving socially desirable responses (Gucciardi et al., 2007). While future 7 \nrefinements to existing measurement instruments are necessary (Crust, 2007), the recent 8 \nadvancements in this area appear promising and likely to encourage more objective 9 \ntesting.  10 \nTransferability 11 \nFrom a theoretical perspective, one of the most important aspects of mental toughness 12 \nwhich researchers urgently need to establish is the concept of transference. Given that 13 \nmental toughness is most often proposed to be a personality disposition (cf. Crust, 14 \n2007), it would seem reasonable to expect that high mental toughness would be 15 \ndemonstrated in various aspects of athletes lives, and not just in their main sports. 16 \nIndeed, it is difficult to conceive mental toughness as only applicable to sport, as many 17 \nother competitive and pressured environments exist beyond sport (performing arts, 18 \nbusiness etc.). There is some evidence of broadening out the study of mental toughness 19 \nalready, with relationships found with effective lifestyle management and dealing with 20 \norganisational stress (Fawcett, 2005).  21 \n Studies such as Jones et al. (2002, 2007) have used samples of athletes from a 22 \nvariety of different sports to better understand the concept of mental toughness. This 23 \napproach appears to assume that mental toughness is a generic, multidimensional 24 \nconcept that is best understood by piecing together common perceptions of elite 25 \n 11 \nathletes. However, participants in such investigations are primarily considered mentally 1 \ntough through being elite or super elite performers in respect of their own sport. To 2 \nadvance knowledge of mental toughness, there needs to be attempts to consider how far 3 \nthe concept impacts on perceptions, cognitions, affect, and behaviour, beyond the 4 \nindividual\u2019s primary sport performance. Does a professional soccer player, who has 5 \nhigh mental toughness, demonstrate mental toughness when faced with other life 6 \nchallenges such as dealing with difficult inter-personal relationship issues, needing to 7 \ntake action in an emergency situation, problem-solving, parenting, or even competing in 8 \na charity endurance challenge? The key question is how do mentally tough individuals 9 \ncope with pressure and adversity outside of their own sport?  10 \nWith the related concept of hardiness, a personality disposition discovered by 11 \nhealth psychologists to be an influential resistance resource when confronting stress 12 \n(Kobasa, 1979; Kobasa, Maddi, & Kahn, 1982; Maddi, 2004), it has been found that 13 \nhardy individuals are not just particularly effective at managing their work related 14 \nstress, but rather in managing all aspects of their lives (cf. Maddi, 2004). Kobasa et al. 15 \n(1982) emphasised the relationship between personality dispositions and coping, 16 \nsuggesting that hardiness might influence coping, and this mechanism might be 17 \nresponsible for buffering stress. More recently Maddi (2004) has described the positive 18 \nrelationship between transformational coping and hardiness, with hardy individuals 19 \nmore likely to diminish (rather than avoid) the threat of a potential stressor by 20 \naddressing not only the problem but also the emotions that it arouses. On this basis, and 21 \nas others have already pointed out (Crust, 2007; Nicholls & Polman, 2007), there is a 22 \nneed to understand the relationship between mental toughness and coping, including the 23 \nevaluation of both cognitive appraisal, and action aspects. Are the same coping process 24 \nused by athletes in their particular sport, also employed when confronting stresses in 25 \n 12 \nother contexts? Furthermore, understanding the influence of mental toughness beyond 1 \nspecific sports contexts has important implications for practitioners and researchers 2 \nconsidering the best approach to developing mental toughness. If mental toughness is a 3 \nbroader personality disposition, then consistent with Gould, Dieffenbach, & Moffett 4 \n(2002), cultural and environmental influences from both inside and outside of sport, and 5 \nmore general life based skills would likely be important in developing mental 6 \ntoughness.   7 \nBridging the Gap between Theory and Practice 8 \nWhile it is important to establish a clear conceptualisation of mental toughness, and to 9 \nunderstand how mental toughness develops, from an applied perspective, practitioners 10 \nare most likely to be concerned with developing mental toughness in their athletes. One 11 \nkey question concerns the degree to which mental toughness is caught via 12 \nenvironmental influences, or taught through training (Gordon et al., 2007). For some 13 \ntime, numerous texts have existed concerning what might broadly be called \u2018mental 14 \ntoughness training\u2019 (Bull et al., 1996; Goldberg, 1998, Loehr, 1995), although these 15 \ntexts appear to lack sufficient theoretical underpinning. Recently, some initial progress 16 \nhas been made in understanding how mental toughness develops through interviewing 17 \nelite athletes, with evidence appearing to suggest a pivotal role for environmental 18 \nfactors (Bull et al., 2005; Connaughton et al., 2008; Gould et al., 2002). In their mental 19 \ntoughness pyramid, which was developed through the study of elite English cricketers, 20 \nBull et al. (2005) propose environmental influences provide the foundation of mental 21 \ntoughness development on the two key levels of upbringing and transition. In terms of 22 \nupbringing, participants reported the importance of parental influence and childhood 23 \nbackground. In relation to transition, the early part of a junior playing career was found 24 \n 13 \nto be important because of exposure to tough environments (playing abroad, as an 1 \noutsider) and providing opportunities to survive early setbacks (learning from failure).  2 \nConnaughton et al. (2008) studied the development of mental toughness in elite 3 \nathletes in relation to Bloom\u2019s (1985) subdivision of career phases (early, middle, later). 4 \nFindings provide further evidence of the importance of environmental influences, with 5 \nvarious individuals (parents, coaches, siblings, senior athletes, sport psychologists etc.) 6 \ncontributing to development, and to social support networks, that extended beyond sport 7 \ncontexts. These researchers also suggested the importance of an appropriate 8 \nmotivational climate (enjoyment and mastery), which is likely to have important 9 \nimplications for transition periods as junior players develop, and attend training 10 \nacademies. Given the highly competitive nature of elite sport, research is needed to 11 \nestablish what type of climate is best suited to developing mental toughness in aspiring 12 \njunior athletes. While the work of Connaughton et al. (2008) and much research in 13 \nphysical education contexts suggests the importance of promoting a mastery based 14 \nclimate, it is clear that elite sport is far more oriented towards outcomes and winning. It 15 \nis therefore legitimate to consider what constitutes the most appropriate environment to 16 \nenable the development of mental toughness. On the basis of \u2018toughening-up\u2019, the 17 \napplication of stress inoculation training, a widely used method in applied sport 18 \npsychology (Clough et al. 2002), assumes that gradual exposure to stress (rather than 19 \navoidance) would be most appropriate. Research into physiological toughness also 20 \nappears to support the notion that stress tolerance can be increased with intermittent 21 \nexposure to stressors (cf. Dienstbier, 1989). Research focusing on the relationship 22 \nbetween motivational climate and mental toughness would appear to be vital to evaluate 23 \nwhether the promotion of mastery climates in sports academies is the best preparation 24 \nfor the psychological demands of professional sport. 25 \n 14 \nFuture researchers should be encouraged to study the development of mental 1 \ntoughness in respect of established theories of development, such as Erikson\u2019s 2 \nPsychosocial Theory (1963). This theory might be particularly suited to the study of 3 \nmental toughness given that Erikson\u2019s most important contribution was considering the 4 \nindividual in context of both family and society, and by identifying the essential 5 \nconcerns of adulthood, including trust, identity, and competence (Wade & Tavris, 6 \n1996). The use of longitudinal research methods is needed to determine how mental 7 \ntoughness changes over time and to establish the crucial developmental periods.  8 \n While the influence of environmental factors on the development of mental 9 \ntoughness appears to have initial support, the role of traditional sport psychology 10 \ninterventions (mental skills training) is less clear. Bull et al. (2005, p.226) suggests that 11 \nit \u2018is also interesting to note that very little of the output relates directly to mental skills 12 \ntraining\u2019, and propose the integration of mental skills training into the appropriate 13 \nenvironment rather than focusing on such techniques in isolation. Interestingly, there is 14 \nevidence that interventions can be successfully used to develop hardiness (cf. Maddi, 15 \n2004), although as Crust (2007) highlights, the prototypical form of hardiness training 16 \nused was clearly more holistic than most sport-based mental skills training approaches. 17 \nOther evidence appears to show that such skills as goal-setting and self-talk have an 18 \nimportant role in the development of mental toughness (Connaughton et al., 2008). With 19 \nthe emergence of instruments to measure mental toughness, there is scope for testing the 20 \nimpact of psychological interventions on mental toughness and this would certainly 21 \nadvance the knowledge base. Questionnaires such as the MT48 (Clough et al., 2002), 22 \nwhich not only measure overall mental toughness, but also include measures of various 23 \nsubscales (Commitment, Challenge, Control \u2013 emotional and life, and Confidence \u2013 in 24 \nabilities, and interpersonal) allow specific components of mental toughness to be 25 \n 15 \ntargeted, rather than applying more generic interventions. As such, case study research, 1 \nfocusing on the needs and developments of individuals, might be an ideal starting point 2 \nin relation to advancing knowledge in this area.  3 \n Another important future direction of mental toughness research that might be 4 \nused to bridge the gap between theory and practice is the identification of observable 5 \nbehaviours that are associated with mentally tough performers. Such behaviours are 6 \nlikely to be observed in both the approach of participants to practice and training 7 \nsessions, and in competitive contexts. This work appears to have begun with Davis and 8 \nZaichkowsky\u2019s (1998) study of mental toughness in ice-hockey. These researchers 9 \nasked coaches, scouts and managers to rate players mental toughness in respect to: (1) 10 \nadversity response (i.e. increased work rate), (2) over-achievement (exceeds usual 11 \nperformance under stress), (3) effort (consistency), (4) enthusiasm (encourages team-12 \nmates), and (5) skill (subjective assessment of demonstrated ability). However, the 13 \nresults remained equivocal since no justification for the five listed categories was given, 14 \nand no standardised performance \/ behavioural checklists were produced to allow 15 \nquantifiable analysis. Despite this, if behavioural checklists could be established in 16 \nspecific sports, then coaches and psychologists might be able to work with players to 17 \npromote such behaviours, and in team sports, use mentally tough players to cultivate 18 \nsuch behaviour in others (perhaps most influentially in relation to younger, developing 19 \nplayers). This is consistent with the findings of Connaughton et al. (2008) which 20 \nidentified the importance of vicarious experience and role models.  21 \n In related research involving social interactions, hardiness has been found to be 22 \nassociated with both giving and receiving encouragement, and various leadership 23 \nbehaviours (cf. Maddi, 2004). Further research into the related behaviours associated 24 \nwith mental toughness might also allow coaches to become more able to identify mental 25 \n 16 \ntoughness in relation to team recruitment, although such approaches must be cautiously 1 \ndeveloped given past misuse of personality measures. A further additional benefit from 2 \nthe development of behavioural checklists is the potential to add to multi-modal 3 \nmeasures of mental toughness and potentially establish more accurate and trustworthy 4 \nmeasurements.         5 \nPhysiological Toughness 6 \nAnother line of research that has important implications for the study of mental 7 \ntoughness is provided by Dienstbier (1989) in his review of arousal and physiological 8 \ntoughness. It would seem important to consider physiological toughness given that 9 \nresearchers have considered physical toughness as a component of mental toughness 10 \n(Gucciardi et al., 2007) and other researchers have noted a relationship between mental 11 \ntoughness and physical endurance \/ pain tolerance (Crust & Clough, 2005). Dienstbier 12 \nconsidered literature concerning human and non-human confrontations with stress 13 \n(defined by appraisals of threat or harm rather than of challenge). The observations that 14 \nDienstbier made in regards to the interrelationship between arousal, performance and 15 \npersonality would appear to be particularly pertinent to the concept of mental toughness.  16 \n Dienstbier (1989) reviewed a number of studies that reported relationships 17 \nbetween task performance and hormonal levels. Evidence from both non-human and 18 \nhuman studies showed that better performances across a variety of tasks appeared to be 19 \nassociated with increased catecholamine levels and quicker return to baseline rates 20 \nfollowing stressful manipulations. In turn, those participants who experienced greater 21 \nincreases in catecholamine were also shown to be more socially adjusted, and to have 22 \ngreater emotional stability (Johansson, Frankenhaeuser, & Magnusson, 1973), lower 23 \nlevels of anxiety (Rauste-von Wright, von Wright, & Frankenhaeuser, 1981) and greater 24 \nadaptive capacity or stress tolerance (Roessler, Burch, & Mefferd, 1967). These same 25 \n 17 \ncharacteristics appear in definitions and as attributes of mentally tough performers. 1 \nDienstbier summarised these finding by stating that \u2018the same manipulations that 2 \nincrease emotional stability and stress tolerance, also increase central and peripheral 3 \ncatecholamine availability\u2019 (p. 86). 4 \n Another important aspect of Dienstbier\u2019s (1989) work is the distinction he made 5 \nin regards to different kinds of arousal; that is Sympathetic Nervous System-adrenal-6 \nmedullary arousal (stimulates the release of the catecholamines adrenaline and nor-7 \nadrenaline) and pituitary-adrenal-cortical arousal (stimulates the release of cortisol). 8 \nHigh levels of cortisol, an important biomarker of stress reactivity (Clow, 2004) appears 9 \nto be related to poor performance and defensiveness (Ursin, Baade, & Levine, 1978; 10 \nVaernes, Ursin, Darragh & Lambe, 1982). Evidence from both human and non-human 11 \nstudies suggest that high levels of cortisol are maintained by a lack of appropriate 12 \nresponses (Dienstbier, 1989). Increasing participant control and enabling participants to 13 \ndefine the situation as \u2018challenging\u2019 prevents high levels of cortisol and depletion of 14 \ncatecholamines (Miller, 1980). Indeed, children who were found to cope more 15 \neffectively with hospitalisation were shown to have lower cortisol levels (Knight, 16 \nAtkins, Eagle, et al., 1979).  17 \n In relation to personality correlates, high cortisol levels have been found to be 18 \nassociated with anxiety, depression and neuroticism (Anisman & La Pierre, 1982) and 19 \nwith low self-esteem (Pruessner, Hellhammer, & Kirschbaum, 1999). Coping more 20 \neffectively with stress appears to require an ability to suppress the cortisol response and 21 \nto resist catecholamine depletion (Dienstbier, 1989). Evidence suggests the cortisol 22 \nresponse to standardised stressors can be attenuated by cognitive behavioural 23 \ninterventions (cf. Clow, 2004). This finding could have important implications for 24 \n 18 \nresearchers wishing to evaluate the role of mental skills training on the development of 1 \nmental toughness. 2 \n The sum of Dienstbier\u2019s (1989) work was the proposal of four toughening 3 \nmanipulations that affect physiological mediators, which are consequently reflected in 4 \nperformance and temperament characteristics. These four manipulation are (1) early 5 \nexperience (early life exposure to stress), (2) passive toughening (intermittent exposure 6 \nto stress that is equivalent to stress inoculation training), (3) active toughening (such as 7 \nexercise) and (4) ageing (opposite effects than other three manipulations, reduces 8 \ntoughening). The second and third of these four proposed manipulations certainly 9 \nsuggests that appropriate interventions could result in \u2018toughening up\u2019.  10 \n On the basis of psychophysiological research, it might be hypothesised that a 11 \nmentally tough individual would exhibit different patterns of reactivity to standardised 12 \nstressors, than would a less tough individual. Specifically, it could be hypothesised that 13 \nhigh levels of mental toughness would be characterised by increased arousal to meet the 14 \nchallenge (larger adrenaline increases) and the ability to cope with stressors more 15 \neffectively (lower cortisol rates). Assessing the impact of mental toughness training on 16 \nbio-markers of stress (i.e. cortisol) would also help to understand exactly how mental 17 \ntoughness operates. Moreover, the establishment of links between multi-source 18 \nmeasures of mental toughness would help to establish more accurate measurement of 19 \nmental toughness.  20 \nPotential Drawbacks of being Mentally Tough 21 \nThe vast majority of research thus far, has considered mental toughness as a positive 22 \npsychological construct, linked to successful outcomes. However, recent research does 23 \nsuggest some possible drawbacks to being mentally tough, especially in relation to 24 \nrecovery from injury. Levy et al. (2006) found support for previous research that 25 \n 19 \nsuggested mental toughness was associated with greater pain tolerance (Crust & 1 \nClough, 2005), but reported that participants with low mental toughness showed better 2 \nadherence to clinic based rehabilitation activity. These researchers suggest this finding 3 \nmight be due to \u2018high mentally tough individuals appraising their injury to be less 4 \nsevere and less susceptible to reoccur and thereby perceive compliance to clinic based 5 \nactivity to be less important\u2019 (Levy et al., 2006, p. 252). On this basis, future researchers 6 \nmight consider testing whether mental toughness is associated with playing on while 7 \ninjured, and injury reoccurrence. There are fascinating arguments that pertain to the 8 \nrelationship between mental toughness and injury that will probably be more 9 \nappropriately approached as research evidence develops. In essence, is mental 10 \ntoughness about playing on while injured, risking long-term damage, and potentially 11 \nreducing team efficiency; or is it taking the difficult decision to stop training and 12 \ncompeting, seeking medical support, focusing on adhering to a program of 13 \nrehabilitation, and returning to action as soon as possible? With the \u2018no pain, no gain\u2019 14 \nphilosophy that apparently pervades elite sport, this would appear to be an important 15 \nquestion for future researchers.        16 \nConclusion 17 \nWhile the study of mental toughness has clearly advanced through more rigorous recent 18 \nstudies (Bull et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2002; 2007) a number of research limitations and 19 \ntheoretical problems are evident. In the present paper it is proposed that the narrow 20 \nfocus on elite and super elite athletes is somewhat restrictive and that mental toughness 21 \nshould more appropriately be considered in relation to an individuals potential. 22 \nFurthermore, it is argued that research which has assumed that elite and super elite 23 \nathletes are mentally toughness with no objective measures sets a dangerous precedent. 24 \nWhile qualitative research has undoubtedly facilitated greater understanding of what 25 \n 20 \nmental toughness is, and how mental toughness develops, with advancements in 1 \nappropriate psychometric measurement instruments, more quantitative studies are to be 2 \nencouraged. Such research will help mental toughness research expand and avoid 3 \nreplication. The challenge that faces future researchers is to be innovative in regards to 4 \nresearch methods, and explore mental toughness in broader contexts. It is unlikely that 5 \nmental toughness is only relevant in the sport domain, so attention is needed to 6 \ndetermine how mentally tough individuals behave in other areas of their lives. Since 7 \ncognitive and physiological functioning are not discrete entities, researchers should be 8 \nencouraged to explore the physiological correlates of mental toughness. In relation to 9 \nthe development of mental toughness, much more work is needed to determine the 10 \neffects of environmental manipulations and skills training approaches to developing this 11 \nimportant construct.  12 \nReferences 13 \nAnisman, H., & LaPierre, Y.
