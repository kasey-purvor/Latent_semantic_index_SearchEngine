This version 14 June 2004.\nIn The Economics of Planning Abram Bergson (1964: 327-9) distinguished between the\neconomic merit and the rationality of socialism. The merit of socialism was to be gauged by\nthe efficiency with which it satisfied consumer welfare. Its rationality could be measured not\nonly against consumer welfare but also in relation to \u2018planners\u2019 preferences.\u2019 Rationality in\neither sense, he suggested, is best measured by \u2018the degree to which conduct conforms to the\nmaterial ends sought \u2026 We are thus led to ask, in respect to Soviet conduct regarding\nresource use, the cardinal question that arises in respect to economic conduct generally: In\nterms of what material ends and to what extent is such behavior economically rational?\u2019\nFew will have changed their minds about the merits of socialism as a result of the opening\nof the archives. The main advances that new documentation has made possible relate to the\nrationality of the Soviet command system. We can learn in unprecedented detail how Soviet\nofficials behaved in the privacy of their offices and why they behaved as they did.\nSpecifically, we find that officials at each level were continually issuing new decrees and\ninstructions to those below them, who rarely did exactly as they were told. At the time the\nsame officials were receiving reports and information from below, some distorted and the rest\nincomplete; their core problem was to verify and control what people were really doing when\nthey claimed to be obeying orders. The fact that officials at each level of the command\nsystem were not merely passive instruments of higher authority is what makes its operation\nan interesting problem.\nHow did Soviet officials command people and allocate resources? How did Stalin and his\nsuccessors get others to do their bidding? This paper is about the rational behaviour of a\nprincipal who gives an order and the agent who is expected to carry it out. In studying the\nbehaviour that we observe historically it tries to answer Bergson\u2019s \u2018cardinal question\u2019: \u2018In\nterms of what material ends and to what extent is such behavior economically rational?\u2019\nAccording to Avner Greif (2000), any institution that persists must be understood as an\nequilibrium of individual motivations and constraints: each person participates in it because it\nis in their interest to do, conditional upon their expectation that others have made the same\ncalculation. How is the equilibrium of individual motivations and constraints achieved in the\ncase of market institutions? Greif describes the fundamental problem of exchange as a game\nthat arises from the sequential nature of a transaction. Two players contemplate a contract to\nengage in mutually beneficial exchange. The first player must initiate the contract and\nadvance the means to fulfil it to the second player, or alternatively abstain. The second must\ndecide to cooperate by completing the contract or cheat by stealing the proceeds of the\nexchange, including the advance, at the expense of the first player. Without means of\nenforcement the best strategy of the second player is to cheat and that of the first is to abstain.\nHistorically, therefore, the rise of market exchange required the development of a variety of\nprivate and public enforcement mechanisms that overcame this problem.\nHierarchies give rise to a corresponding fundamental problem of command. The origin of\nthe problem is the same, the sequential nature of a transaction. A principal gives an order to\nan agent and advances the means to implement it. Why is an order necessary? Because the\nprincipal desires an allocation of resources that differs from the one that would result from\nthe agent\u2019s pursuit of her own self-interest; if this were not the case then the desired\nallocation would result from the agent\u2019s action without having to be told. It follows that for\nthe hierarchy to find an equilibrium the obedient agent must be induced to forego\nopportunities for private gain. This problem must be solved for a hierarchy to find an\nequilibrium.\nHierarchies have existed in many forms and for many reasons. One form is the modern\ncorporation. The transaction-cost approach of Coase (1937) and Williamson (1975) suggests\nthat corporations exist in order to realise potential efficiency gains. In neo-Marxian\neconomics, however, they exist to exert power and monopolise resources (Hymer,\n21960\/1976; Marglin, 1974). In the first case the hierarchy grows because its superior\nefficiency gives it a competitive advantage, and society gains as a result. In the second case it\ngrows by stifling competition and extracting a monopoly rent, while society suffers a welfare\nloss.\nIn this paper we will think about a particular kind of hierarchy, the command system. The\ncommand system is a hierarchy that is driven by monopolisation, not cost reduction: it\nattempts to monopolise a territory by force. Monopolisation is the strategy that Evgenii\nPreobrazhensky (1926\/1965) advocated for the Soviet economy in the 1920s. We are also\nlooking at something similar to Mancur Olson (1993) when he analyzed a proprietary\ndictator.\nThe problem that I describe is present in all complex hierarchical organisations, even\nwhere their existence is predicated on superior efficiency. This is because, even if an\norganisation exists solely to enable its members to exploit a mutual efficiency gain that is\nshared with society, any individual within the organisation can gain still more by shirking or\ncheating the other members. Such opportunities have always been present in command\nsystems to the extent that their monopolizing drive was never completely successful and their\ncontrol over resources remained partially, not fully centralised. We will use the Soviet\neconomy as an example.\nThe Fundamental Problem of Command\nIn a market system each player\u2019s first option is to abstain. In a command system there is\ncompulsion: to abstain is mutiny or desertion and these are punished. The agent can decide\nonly to obey or disobey. Disobedience can take more than one form. Figure 1 illustrates the\npossible outcomes. The obedient agent receives the wage advanced w and returns the planned\noutput x to the principal who gains a net surplus x w\uf02d . The disobedient agent may shirk, i.e.\ntake the wage and ignore the command. The shirker\u2019s payoff is the wage plus the gain in\nreduced effort, w e\uf02b , which is always preferable to the wage alone, while the principal\nrecords a loss, \u2013w.\nFigure 1. The Fundamental Problem of Command\nWhen the economy is only partly centralised the agent has an outside option: steal the\nwage advanced and invest it with a private network of persons outside the hierarchy. There\nare profit opportunities that the command system has left unexploited either by intention, just\nas a monopolist deliberately restricts supply and capacity usage, or by mistake because of\nplan errors. Where these opportunities exist, an unofficial network can move in and reap\nsome of the gains privately. The agent stands to gain p q\uf0d7 where q is the value of the agent\u2019s\nshare in the opportunity and p is the probability that she can realise it. In fact, p measures\nhorizontal trust or \u2018honour among thieves.\u2019 Where criminals mistrust each other crime cannot\nbe organised and private networks will lack the scope to realise available opportunities. Also,\nwhere thieves lack honour the agent will not be able to enforce her share in the return from a\nprivate venture by private means; she will rationally expect others in the network to steal\nfrom her what she stole from the principal in the first place.\n,w p q\uf02d \uf0d7\nAgent\nObeys Steals\n,x w w\uf02d\nShirks\n,w w e\uf02d \uf02b\n3The one-shot game has bad and less bad news for the principal. The less bad news is that\nthe agent will prefer compliance to stealing while horizontal mistrust is high. The bad news is\nthat, even if the agent will not steal, she will always shirk.\nThe news is better when the game is repeated. Suppose the principal responds to one-time\ndisobedience by terminating the agent\u2019s position and expelling her from the hierarchy, so that\nshe has nothing left to take into the horizontal network in the next round; then obedience is\nthe agent\u2019s only move that can allow her to take part repeatedly and this is the principal\u2019s best\nhope. Repeated infinitely, obedience will return \uf028 \uf0291w \uf064\uf02d to the agent where \u03b4 is the discount\nfactor and 1 0\uf064\uf03e \uf03e . It follows that a forward-looking agent will prefer compliance to\nshirking where \uf028 \uf0291w e\uf064 \uf064\uf0d7 \uf02d \uf03e , and the latter is more likely the less the agent discounts the\nfuture.\nSimilarly the agent will prefer compliance to theft if \uf028 \uf0291w p q\uf064\uf02d \uf03e \uf0d7 . To draw out the\nintuition, compliance is more likely the higher is the official wage compared with unofficial\nprofit opportunities, but even in the presence of a clear efficiency deficit that makes tempting\nprivate opportunities the principal can still keep the agent compliant provided honour among\nthieves remains low and the agent places a low enough discount on the future.\nThe fundamental problem of command can be interpreted broadly. The principal can be\nanybody who has a non-market relationship with an agent, from a great ruler to a lowly office\nmanager. The unofficial network can be anybody external to the agent\u2019s hierarchy who may\nshare the gain arising from the principal\u2019s loss: a principal in another hierarchy, a family\nfriend, a criminal gang, or a foreign power. The asset of which the principal is cheated need\nnot be understood as a narrowly material object. For example, the problem of command also\ndescribes the situation of a proprietorial dictator (Olson, 1993) who aims to monopolise the\nloyalty of the citizens; in this context the citizen\u2019s loyalty is a reproducible, transferable asset\nthat the citizen may invest in the dictator, withhold, or transfer to the opposition (Wintrobe,\n1990). These correspond to the agent\u2019s choices to comply, shirk, or steal.\nThe Soviet Economy as a Command System\nThe fundamental problem of command may be fairly obvious as a theoretical idea and yet\nhave little or nothing to do with real life in a command system. In order to show a connection\nbetween history and theory I will use the Soviet economy to provide some data.\nSome details of the Soviet command system are relevant. As Bergson (1964: 15-48)\ndescribed it most enterprises were state owned and most producers were agents of a\ngovernment principal, usually a minister acting as the legal fundholder. Horizontal\nrelationships of specialisation and exchange were organised by order from above through\nvertical hierarchies rather than directly between buyers and sellers on a voluntary basis.\nVertical subordination permitted orders to flow downwards on the basis of the information\nthat flowed upwards.\nThe Soviet hierarchy was formed by a dictator, Stalin, who was unchallenged by his\nclosest associates from 1932 until his death in 1953 (Davies, Ili\u010d, and Khlevniuk, 2004). He\nruled by decree: thus it was said that \u2018the plan is the law\u2019 (e.g. Gregory, 2003: 164). He ruled\nby delegation, so under him many smaller dictators exercised unconstrained power within the\nspecialised fiefs that he allocated to them. Power cascaded downward through branching\nnetworks of agents that collectively formed the so-called nomenklatura, but in practice the\n\u2018big\u2019 nomenklatura of a million posts was fractionalised because every little dictator nested\nhis own little nomenklatura inside the big one and demanded its loyalty (Khlevniuk, 2003;\nLewin, 2003).\n4Consequently, the Soviet state took the form of a nested dictatorship in which \u2018each\norganisation duplicated the administrative control structures of its superior in the vertical\nchain of command\u2019 (Gregory and Markevich, 2002.) The dominant administrative\nrelationship at each level of the state was that of principal and agent, with each principal in\nturn acting as the agent of a higher principal until we reach the top where the great dictator\nruled alone as capo di capi.\nThe Soviet command system was defined by hierarchical complexity: parallel hierarchies\nthat were functionally differentiated at lower levels converged at the top in unified leading\nbodies such as the council of ministers and the politburo. To fulfil its function each\nspecialised hierarchy had to trade horizontally with others. Thus the defence ministry\npurchased equipment and fuel from industry and food from agriculture; the ministry for\nengineering bought metals from the steel industry and power from the electricity generating\nindustry. The coordination problem created by specialised hierarchies was solved only partly\nthrough centralisation. Rather there was \u2018centralised pluralism\u2019 (Nove, 1977: 60-4), meaning\nthat much decentralised allocation went on behind a centralised fa\u00e7ade (see also Zaleski,\n1980; Markevich, 2003).\nOne reason for partial centralisation was the impossibility of forcing full information\nsharing in hierarchies. The process of reaching economic equilibrium in markets requires\nagents to share information. This sharing is voluntary and partial: voluntary because self-\ninterested, and partial because each agent does not need to know everything about all other\nagents for an equilibrium to result. According to Hayek (1945) economizing on information-\nsharing is one of the merits of the market system. In the Soviet command system, in contrast,\nthe sharing of information was subject to coercion. Coercion arose because agents had\nincentives to conceal information rather than share it. The coercion was asymmetric: the\nprincipal had a right to know everything but the agent did not have a right to know anything.\nHowever, there were limits to the principal\u2019s coercion. The principal depended on the agent\nto select and aggregate information since he could not handle high-volume detail. The agent\nhad self-interested motives to disclose information selectively and to distort it before\ndisclosure. Thus, the principal could not trust what the agent told him, and did not know what\nthe agent did not tell him, unless he could sought additional information by other means at\nadditional cost.\nFaced with this information problem, central authorities delegated responsibility for the\ndetail of inter-ministerial exchange to ministerial officials. Such exchanges were authorised\nin high-level plans and decrees only in broad outline; then the ministries themselves had to\nnegotiate detailed contracts for specific commodities that implemented the plan (Gregory,\n2003). In principle, the implementation of contracts rested on budget authorisation by the\nministry of finance and credit authorisation by the state bank. In practice, because the plan\ndealt only with aggregates and the budget dealt only with rubles, there were wide spheres of\ninformal market allocation where firms competed for real resources with each other and with\nhouseholds (Harrison and Kim, 2004). Markets were wider for general-purpose intermediate\nproducts and consumables than for more specialised products such as special-purpose\nmachinery where supply or demand were more easily monopolised. Whether or not\ncompetition existed, weak oversight promoted ministerial discretion and led to protracted\ninter-ministerial bargaining and disputes (Kroll, 1986; Harrison and Simonov, 2000; Belova,\n2001a; Belova and Gregory, 2002).\nIt is well known that elements of market organisation persisted inside and alongside the\ncommand system. There were illegal markets for many industrial materials and consumer\ngoods and services and legal markets for labour and labour-intensive foodstuffs\n(Katsenelinboigen, 1977). Historically these markets evolved in various ways. For the\nmajority that escaped penal servitude the labour market remained relatively free but there\n5were 15 years of much heavier regulation around World War II (Filtzer, 2002). At first the\nauthorities tried to suppress the food market altogether, and they did achieve a broad state\nmonopoly of grains and larger livestock, but the food shortages that resulted compelled them\nto concede legality to the market supply of backyard food products (Davies, 1994).\nMonitoring and Enforcement\nIn the Soviet economy principals waged a continual struggle against shirking and theft. They\nalso faced the fact that agents who intended to comply with orders did not always accept\nthem unconditionally but sometimes tried to renegotiate them before complying. The\nauthorities developed a wide range of mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement that\nsecured the participation of the players in the command system. The outcome was an\nequilibrium of behaviours and expectations that secured the willing participation of all the\nplayers.\nThe need to solve the fundamental problem of command parsimoniously explains a\nnumber of Soviet economic institutions and suggests an agenda for more research. The\ndevelopment of several distinct mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement, each with\ndifferent technologies, costs, and returns, implies that the dictator had scope to optimise on\nseveral margins at once. More research may lead us to a more unified explanation of the\ngreat shifts in Soviet reliance on propaganda and education, legal and relational enforcement,\nforced labour, secrecy, and military power, in terms of a general equilibrium rather than\nconsidering each in isolation.\nMulti-Layer, Multi-Stage Monitoring\nInformation asymmetries pervaded the Soviet command system. Agents could exploit them at\nthe expense of the principal, for example by persuading the principal that they had fulfilled an\nassignment when they had not (Harrison, 1998). If the principal could not tell whether he was\nreceiving a yield of x, 0, or \u2013w he did not have much hope of solving the fundamental\nproblem of command. Since the dictator could not trust agents in the direct line of command\nto tell the truth, he developed other means that met this need including separate hierarchies\nfor planning and auditing (Gregory, 1990; Gregory, 2001; Belova and Gregory, 2002),\nfinancial and legal regulation (Gorlizki, 2002), contractual observance (Belova, 2001a), and\nso on. Thus, many agencies monitored activities, tracked outcomes, and reported to the boss.\nHimself inscrutable and devious, Stalin required complete openness in those he allowed\nto report to him. He reacted severely to the least suspicion of a self-interested lie, more so if it\nappeared to involve horizontal collusion (Gorlizki and Khlevniuk, 2004). Stalin\u2019s mistrust of\nhis own monitors was rational. The problem that resulted was: quis custodiet ipsos custodes\n[who watches the watchmen]? In the mid-1930s Stalin handed over the role of monitoring the\nmonitors to the security \u2018organs\u2019 with results that are well known.\nThe authorities intensified monitoring by advancing w in instalments and frequently\nchecking progress. Breaking production and innovation cycles into many intermediate stages\nshortened the period over which an agent could behave badly before being expelled from the\nhierarchy. A by-product was the creation of sunk costs that, in a context of credit and fiscal\ncentralisation, gave rise to Kornai\u2019s (1980) famous \u2018soft\u2019 budget constraint (Dewatripont and\nMaskin, 1995).\nMulti-layer, multi-stage monitoring was costly. The centralisation of information that it\nrequired was only feasible within historical limits. Consider the information cost of\nmonitoring a given outcome. Information costs fell rapidly in the nineteenth century and\nmore rapidly in the twentieth century. However, the outcomes were changing too: the share\nof services in output was rising and there was growing variation in product and service\nquality (Harrison, 1998). Real output and value became harder to observe and accurately\n6measure . As a result the viability of centralised, multi-layer monitoring followed an inverse\nU curve: it was more effective between 1870 and 1970, less before and less after (Broadberry\nand Ghosal, 2004).\nEnforcement Mechanisms\nInternalisation and Promotion. One way to achieve a command equilibrium was to persuade\nthe agent to desire the same outcomes as the principal, that is to internalise the latter\u2019s\nvaluations. Through schooling and the media Soviet leaders invested in persuading citizens to\nrespect authority and adopt patriotic and party-minded norms. They developed costly rites of\npassage into citizenship, party membership, and military service, and also used humiliation\nrituals such as the \u2018boards of shame\u2019 that stigmatised bad citizens. They induced many to\ninternalise preferences for the state to own basic industries, guarantee employment, social\ncare, and minimum incomes, and protect the collective before the individual. These\npreferences typically outlived the emigration of individuals (Silver, 1987) and the demise of\nthe system (Blanchflower and Freeman, 1997).\nThe promotion of Soviet values may be thought of as the costly creation of a costly moral\nidentity, that of a loyal and obedient homo sovieticus, to which the citizen could subscribe\nthrough loyal activity, acquire a stake, and so gain access to a stream of psychological\nrewards. Having subscribed to this identity she then found shirking or stealing to be more\ncostly than before since it triggered the loss of identity. There were innumerable ethnic,\ndepartmental, and campaign-oriented variations on the general theme: for example,\nSiegelbaum (1988: 210-46) has described how the state promoted the identity of a\nStakhanovite worker in the late 1930s. There was a risk that the variation could become more\nimportant than the theme and weaken loyalty to the dictator beyond a point; thus Stalin\nacquired a rational mistrust of the \u00e9sprit de corps of the armed forces and aimed to destroy it\nin 1937.\nIt was possible to induce the agent to adopt the values of the principal by offering\npromotion in return for loyal behaviour. Then the obedient agent could hope to become a\nprincipal. A problem was that the number of aspiring agents tended to exceed the number of\nretiring principals. Under Stalin this problem was solved by frequent purges combined with\nministerial subdivisions that created new leading positions in great numbers; \u2018I need not\nmention,\u2019 Stalin (1939\/40: 650) reported, \u2018that the division of organisations has made it\npossible to promote hundreds and thousands of new people to leading posts.\u2019 But purges and\nreorganisations were also costly. Valery Lazarev (2005) suggests that the promotion\nmechanism eventually became unviable and threatened the command system with\nbankruptcy.\nArtificial Punishment and Rewards. In the first turbulent years, the Stalinist leadership\ntried to run a high-employment, low-wage economy (Kuromiya, 1988) with predictable\nresults: widespread shirking, demoralisation, and increasingly punitive reflexes. From 1931\nonwards Soviet leaders tilted the balance of incentives towards compliance by supplementing\nw with side payments to induce high effort that Bergson (1964: 72-92) described. They also\nthreatened to cut or confiscate incomes altogether as the penalty for shirking and other\ndisloyalty. They expelled non-compliant agents from the hierarchy by resort to firing and\nforced labour.\nThe efficacy of this route was limited for two reasons. One is that rewards and\npunishments were hard to target on effort with much accuracy. Effort was hard to monitor\nwhile output became harder to measure. The output-effort relationship in the 1930s and 1940s\nwas dominated by random shocks. As a result the application of penalties for supposed\nshirking was also nearly random (Filtzer, 2002). Finally, the penalties available were very\ncostly. After Stalin the credibility of punishment went into a long decline (Harrison, 2002).\n7Another reason for limited effectiveness is that penalisation of some agents must be\ncarried out by others who require a reward in return. Therefore, in any hierarchy the balance\nof rewards to penalties should rise as we ascend from one level to the next; a regressive\ndistribution of managerial rewards for fulfilment is exactly what we see in the figures that\nBergson (1964: 76) assembled. Given persistent labour shortage, however, it was often harder\nto find effective punishments for ordinary workers than for their managers. As a result,\nlabour-management collusion pervaded the Soviet enterprise.\nGeneral Criminalisation, Selective Sanctions. Although the authorities could not\neliminate the scope for the horizontal networks that threatened to corrupt official hierarchies,\nthey could limit it. By criminalizing unauthorised transactions the authorities won a natural\nadvantage in their struggle: they ruled out public enforcement of private deals so that agents\nwho sought a return from diverting the principal\u2019s assets into the underground had to rely on\nrelational enforcement alone. This nested the fundamental problem of exchange within the\nproblem of command to the advantage of the principal.\nAgents could enforce illicit transactions more easily when they were of low value,\nquickly sequenced, or based close acquaintance through the \u2018economy of favours\u2019 (Ledeneva,\n1998). But the mistrust associated with the fundamental problem of exchange impeded large,\nlong-range, unique, or complex deals and so eased the problem of command.\nThe authorities discriminated between two kinds of corruption. Disloyal agents took\nbribes for personal enrichment. Others extracted cash, resources, and favours from loyal\nmotivations, for use in fulfilling plan assignments. Those who intended to comply with\ncommands often had little alternative but to deal corruptly with external networks in order to\ncarry them out (Belova, 2001b; Gregory, 2003: 164). Principals could control the balance\nbetween loyal and disloyal corruption by varying the tautness of plan assignments (Harrison\nand Kim, 2004).\nWhen they detected illicit trade the authorities punished violations selectively, passing\nover the \u2018loyal\u2019 but corrupt transactions that were designed to promote fulfilment of the plan\n(Gregory, 2003) and bearing down more heavily on those that enriched the agent personally\n(Belova, 2001b). In turn, the risk premium that agents required for engaging in loyal trade\nshould have been lower than for trade that lined their own pockets. By implication, the\nauthorities discouraged disloyal networks while exploiting the networks of the loyal.\nHeavy Defence Spending. This framework supports a simple interpretation of the\ndomestic calculations behind foreign policy and military spending. Facing adversaries at\nhome and abroad, Stalin did not fear them acting singly but he feared their combination\n(Khlevniuk, 1995, Simonov 1996). The potential for external foes to exploit internal\ntreachery is portrayed in the fundamental problem of command as the scope for an agent to\ntrade with a network representing a foreign power. From this point of view the powerful\narmed forces supported by a large defence industry described in recent work (Simonov, 1996;\nBarber and Harrison, 2000; Samuelson, 2000) drove down the chances of a deal between\ndomestic and foreign agents by reducing both the reward that the foreign power would offer\nan agent and the probability that the agent could enforce the transaction privately and collect\nher reward from the foreign power.\nBy paying the soldiers and defence producers well Stalin was also able to raise w, the\nopportunity cost to his agent of collaboration with the enemy. Thus the scale of the defence\neffort and the privilege it gave to the servants of the military-industrial complex helped to\nsolve the fundamental problem of command. This solution was very expensive, consuming a\nlarge share of national resources that was shrouded in state secrecy.\nSecretiveness. The Soviet state carried secrecy to extraordinary lengths (Davies, 2001).\nSecrecy of economic information may have assisted principals in inhibiting the temptation to\nsteal. A prerequisite for trade is the sharing of information: buyer and seller must be able to\n8signal each other about ex ante supplies and demands (Hayek, 1945). When trade is between\nan agent in a hierarchy and an outsider, criminalizing the exchange of signals inhibits\nexchange by reducing information and increasing mistrust (Harrison, 2004). Unverifiable\ninformation reduced the probability p of honour among thieves. Alternatively, the agent must\nincur extra costs to restore trust and ensure the credibility of the signals she sends and\nreceives. This cost arises even when illicit signalling is not detected or punished.\nSecrecy was costly in terms of enforcement and efficiency. Enforcement required the\ncostly tracking of secret documents and further efforts to monitor and investigate cases of\ndisclosure. The punishment of disclosure led to the loss of human capital already sunk in\nagents who turned out to be disloyal. Efficiency costs arose because secrecy created barriers\nto the sharing of information that could have led to efficient reallocations; for example,\nprincipals fixed the overall allocation of resources in ignorance of specific facts, while agents\nmade specific allocations while insufficiently informed of the wider context. Thus secrecy\nalso increased the probability of planning mistakes that lowered x and raised q.\nSummary\nA range of enforcement mechanisms addressed the fundamental problem of command in the\nSoviet economy. Internalisation, promotion, and side payments and penalties controlled\nshirking. The criminalisation of disloyal networks, heavy defence spending, and secretiveness\nlimited agents\u2019 trading at the principal\u2019s expense. But each was costly in different ways. The\nSoviet system combined them in a balance that shifted through time as principals and agents\nlearned and the comparative costs of each mechanism changed. It seems that at the end of the\n1980s the ensemble ceased to be viable and the system collapsed (Harrison, 2002). If the\ndictator had succeeded in optimizing simultaneously on each margin, one would expect that\neach mechanism failed at about the same time. This is roughly what is meant by the collapse\nof a system.\nCommand and Negotiation\nIn a speech to the sixteenth party congress in June 1930, Stalin (1930\/1955: 357) defended\nthe recent radical increases in final targets for the first five-year plan on the basis that he\nrecognised the possibility of plan mistakes. The five-year plan was, he suggested\nmerely \u2026 a first approximation, which has to be made more precise, altered and\nperfected in conformity with the experience gained in the localities, with the experience\ngained in carrying out the plan. No five-year plan can take into account all the\npossibilities latent in the depths of our system and which reveal themselves only in the\ncourse of the work, in the course of carrying out the plan \u2026 Only bureaucrats can think\nthat the work of planning ends with the drafting of a plan. The drafting of a plan is only\nthe beginning of planning. Real guidance in planning develops only after the plan has\nbeen drafted, after it has been tested in the localities, in the course of carrying it out,\ncorrecting it and making it more precise.\nAt the time Stalin meant to encourage agents to make plans more ambitious, but in\nsubsequent years he allowed his comments to be taken out of context and reinterpreted to\nsanction all kinds of plan modifications including the relaxation of targets when the plan\nturned out to be too ambitious (Harrison, 1985: 17).\nIn short, the ability to command well does not always accompany the power to command.\nSo far I have assumed that (1) the principal was powerless to mitigate his plan mistakes that\nhelped to form private profit opportunities and (2) the returns to different activities were\ncommon knowledge. However, it is normal that in hierarchies information is distributed\nunevenly. The principal has better general knowledge while the agent has the advantage in\n9local knowledge. As a result, it was possible for a principal to make a mistake and an agent to\nknow it. One way of raising returns in the command system was to let the agent bargain for\nan improved plan. The obedient agent could then choose to disobey, obey unconditionally, or\nbargain with the principal.\nFigure 2. Unconditional and Conditional Obedience\nVertical bargaining is shown in Figure 2. The agent offers to share information about plan\nmistakes and unexploited opportunities with the principal in return for a share of the\nprincipal\u2019s rent. Initially the principal advanced w1 and expected to receive x1. At stage 1 the\nagent chooses between disobedience and absolute and conditional obedience. Conditional\nobedience involves lobbying: the agent takes \uf06c from her advance and invests it in making the\ncase for a better project that can yield x2 for the principal and w2 for the agent. At stage 2 the\nprincipal decides whether or not to accept the agent\u2019s case. If yes, at stage 3 nature takes a\nhand: it deals 2 1x x\uf03e with probability a and x1 otherwise so a is the probability that the\noriginal command was in error. The agent expects her lobby to succeed with probability b,\nwhich therefore measures the credibility of her case; if she succeeds, the agent\u2019s gain is that\nthe principal will advance 2 1w w\uf03e to her and also reimburse \uf06c, the cost of lobbying. If\nlobbying fails the agent is worse off: she will get only the original advance and must pay the\nlobbying cost from it.\nIf we take into account that bargaining takes time and that the players may have\npreferences over the time it takes to reach a solution, the resulting problem begins to\nresemble Rubinstein bargaining with an outside option (Rubinstein, 1982; Shaked and Sutton,\n1984); the outside option is the return to covert disobedience. This case differs in that, while\nthe bargaining costs of principal and agent are fixed, who bears the cost is part of the bargain.\nIn Figure 2 the fundamental problem of command is mitigated as long as both principal\nand agent gain from plan renegotiation over unconditional compliance. The agent gains\nprovided \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0292 1 1b w w b \uf06c\uf0d7 \uf02d \uf03e \uf02d \uf0d7 , i.e. the expected wage gain adjusted by the credibility of\n1. Agent\n1 1 1,x w w\uf02d\nObeys\nUnconditionally\n1,w p q\uf02d \uf0d7\nStealsShirks\n1 1,w w e\uf02d \uf02b\nObeys\nConditionally\n1 1 1,x w w \uf06c\uf02d \uf02d\nAccepts with\nprob. b\nRejects\n2.

Nature\n10\nher information about plan errors exceeds the lobbying cost taking into account the\nprobability that she will have to pay it. Thus, a \u2018listening\u2019 principal can reduce the relative\nattractions of shirking or stealing. However, listening is costly. The principal will gain only if\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf0292 1 2 1a x x w w \uf06c\uf0d7 \uf02d \uf03e \uf02d \uf02b , i.e. his expected efficiency gain exceeds the compensation the\nagent extracts from him as a return on her successful lobbying, plus the deadweight cost of\nrenegotiation. The larger are the probability of a mistaken command and the scope for\nmistakes, the greater will be the principal\u2019s gain.\nPlan bargaining went on in the Soviet economy at every level. In the Politburo ministers\nlobbied Stalin to improve their shares of budgetary or material resources (Gregory, 2001: 22-\n4). At lower levels Bergson (1964: 81-2) noted the tendency of firms to complain of\nburdensome quotas or demand increased supply allocations as a condition for fulfilling them\n(see also Kornai, 1992: 121-4; Gregory, 2003: 202-4). Of course the agent preferred to tell\nthe principal that the plan was too ambitious while the principal preferred to be told that the\nplan was too modest. In cases such as the counter-plan campaign of the early 1930s or the\nStakhanov campaign a few years later (Kuromiya, 1988; Davies and Khlevniuk, 2002) the\nauthorities organised countervailing pressure. The information advantage of the agent was\ngreatest at the frontiers of military science and technology (Holloway, 1982; Holloway,\n1984). In research and development the inventors\u2019 enthusiasm gave rise to strenuous\ncompetitive lobbying to boost plans (Harrison, 2003a). But when plans called for known\nadvances to be applied to production the enthusiasm for higher plans disappeared (Berliner,\n1976).\nIn the years of Stalin\u2019s dictatorship plan renegotiation remained informal. The post-Stalin\neconomic reforms tended to institutionalise it. For example Kornai (1986: 1700) described\nHungary in the 1980s as:\na bargaining society, and the main direction is vertical, namely bargaining between the\nlevels of the hierarchy, or between bureaucracy and firm, not horizontal, between seller\nand buyer. All issues \u2026 \u2013 entry, exit, appointment, output, input, price, wage, tax,\nsubsidy, credit, and investment \u2013 are subject to meticulous negotiations, fights, lobbying\n\u2026 The Hungarian literature calls this phenomenon \u2018regulator bargaining\u2019; it has taken\nthe place of \u2018plan bargaining\u2019 which had prevailed in the command economy.\nWhat has escaped analysis is why such bargaining was increasingly in the principal\u2019s\ninterest. Planning was based on imperfect information. Conservative planning \u2018from the\nachieved level\u2019 (Birman, 1978), superimposed on growing complexity, gave rise to increasing\nmisallocation. While faith in the system declined, agents\u2019 representations became\nincreasingly persuasive and rent-sharing in return for information-sharing became\nincreasingly formalised.\nConclusions\nAbram Bergson sought to examine the rationality of the Soviet economic system according to\nvarious efficiency standards, including that of the system\u2019s directors. In terms of what\nmaterial ends and to what extent was their behaviour rational? We have looked at Soviet\ninstitutions and behaviours from the point of view of a rational principal and agent in a\ncommand system that faces a problem. The fundamental problem of command is that of\nenforcement when agents may shirk or steal rather than comply. The equilibrium of the\nSoviet command system was conditional on finding solutions to this problem, and we have\nlooked at some enforcement mechanisms that together may have provided the necessary\nconditions at the time but were also costly in different ways. This approach suggests that the\nsystem collapsed when the costs of enforcement could no longer be sustained.\n11\nReferences\nBarber, J and Harrison, M (eds). 2000: The Soviet defence-industry complex from Stalin to\nKhrushchev.
