INTRODUCTION\nThe magnitude and orientational dependence ~anisotro-\npy! of the solid\u2013liquid interfacial free energy, g, is a primary\ncontrolling parameter in the kinetics and morphology of\ncrystal growth from the melt,1 especially in the case of den-\ndritic growth.2 As a consequence, the ability to accurately\nmeasure or predict this quantity for specific materials is of\nsignificant technological and scientific importance. For most\nmaterials, the only experimental data for g is extracted indi-\nrectly from nucleation data ~assuming some level of classical\nnucleation theory!.1,3,4 Such indirect measurements tend to\nunderestimate the actual interfacial free energy by 10%\u201320%\nand represent orientational averages, so all information as to\ninterfacial anisotropy is lost. Direct experimental measure-\nments, usually involving contact angle studies, are quite dif-\nficult and relatively few in number,5 and, with the exception\nof a small number of studies on transparent organic ma-\nterials,6,7 are not of sufficient precision to resolve anisotropy.\nThis paucity of reliable direct experimental measurements on\ntechnologically useful materials ~such as metals! has moti-\nvated the development of a variety of novel computational\nmethods to determine g via molecular simulation.8\u201311\nThe interfacial free energy of a crystal\u2013melt interface is\ndefined1 as the reversible work required to form a unit area\nof interface. In a simulation this can be accomplished by\nconstructing a continuous thermodynamic path from an ini-\ntial system consisting of separated bulk crystal and liquid to\na final state containing an interface. The value of g is then\ndetermined by thermodynamic integration12 along that path.\nThis is a tedious process and care must to be taken to ensure\nthat the process is reversible, i.e., integration along the path\nin both the forward and backward directions yields the same\nresult ~no hysteresis!. The first such calculation on a crystal\u20137650021-9606\/2003\/118(16)\/7651\/7\/$20.00\nownloaded 19 Aug 2013 to 143.210.121.140.

To perform\nthe thermodynamic integration they employed external\ncleaving potentials that were slowly turned on to separate the\nsamples. The precise ~rather complex! functional forms of\nthe cleaving potentials were chosen, more or less by trial and\nerror, to minimize hysteresis. The values of g were deter-\nmined to be 0.35~2!, 0.34~2!, and 0.36~2! ~in units of e\/s2)\nfor the @111#, @100#, and @110# crystal orientations, respec-\ntively. The numbers in parentheses give the uncertainties in\nthe last digit shown. The main source of this error is the\nsmall amount of hysteresis in the cleaving of the liquid\nphase. Unfortunately, the precision of these results was not\nsufficient to resolve the anisotropy of the interfacial free en-\nergy for this system.\nRecently, we have developed a modification of the\nBroughton and Gilmer approach in which planar cleaving\nwalls, as opposed to cleaving potentials, are used to separate\nthe phases. These walls are constructed out of the same type\nof particles as present in the system, with a two-dimensional\n~2-D! geometry consistent with the symmetry of the interfa-\ncial orientation under study. This method was originally ap-\nplied to the crystal\u2013melt interface of a system of hard\nspheres9 and was shown to have sufficient precision to re-\nsolve the anisotropy with @111# being the lowest free energy\nface, followed by @100# and @110#. The cleaving wall method\nis complementary to a method due to Hoyt, Asta, and\nKarma10 in which the interfacial free energy is extracted\nfrom the interfacial stiffness, which is determined from the\nspectrum of fluctuations in an interfacial position. The cleav-\ning wall method has an advantage in that it requires simula-\ntions with an order of magnitude fewer particles than those1 \u00a9 2003 American Institute of Physics\nt.

Laird\nDrequired for the fluctuation method (O@104# versus O@105#).\nThe precision in the raw values of the interfacial free ener-\ngies is greater for the cleaving wall method than in the fluc-\ntuation approach ~even considering the far smaller system\nsamples!; however, the fluctuation method yields some-\nwhat more precise values of the anisotropy parameters since\nthese are obtained from the anisotropy of the interfacial stiff-\nness, which is far more anisotropic than the interfacial free\nenergy.\nIn this work, we extend our cleaving wall approach\nto systems of particles interacting with continuous potentials,\nspecifically applying it to the system of truncated LJ particles\nconsidered by Broughton and Gilmer. Our results at the triple\npoint are consistent with the Broughton and Gilmer cal-\nculation, but are of greater precision, allowing us to resolve\nthe anisotropy, which is found to differ slightly from that\nfor the hard-sphere system.9 In addition, we determine the\ntemperature dependence of g along the coexistence curve.\nThe magnitude of g is shown to scale roughly linearly\nwith the melting temperature ~as predicted by the hard-\nsphere model!.13\nII. THE CLEAVING WALL METHOD\nThe direct determination of the excess free energy of the\ncrystal\u2013fluid interface of a model system within a computer\nsimulation can be achieved by thermodynamic integration\nalong a reversible path beginning with separate crystal and\nfluid bulk systems prepared at the coexistence conditions and\nending with a system containing a crystal\u2013liquid interface at\nequilibrium with the surrounding bulk phases. The construc-\ntion of such a path requires the development of a procedure\nto reversibly cleave a simulation box into two noninteracting\nsystems. Following the prescription of Broughton and\nGilmer,8 we identify the following steps in the process of\ncreating the crystal\u2013liquid interface ~see Fig. 1!.\n~1! Step 1: Split the crystal bulk system with a suitably\nchosen \u2018\u2018cleaving\u2019\u2019 potential while maintaining the periodic\nboundary conditions.\n~2! Step 2: Split the liquid system in a similar way.\n~3! Step 3: Juxtapose the cleaved crystal and liquid sys-\ntems by rearranging the boundary conditions while maintain-\ning the cleaving potentials.\n~4! Step 4: Remove the cleaving potentials from the\ncombined system.\nThe interfacial free energy is calculated as the total work\nrequired to perform the above steps divided by the area of\nthe constructed interface. In addition to the coexistence con-\nditions, the result will also depend on the orientation of the\ncrystal with respect to the interfacial plane. We will refer to\nthe plane along which the crystal and liquid systems are split\nas the cleaving plane. The location of the cleaving plane in\nthe crystal system is chosen in the center of the simulation\nbox between two crystal layers, while in the liquid system\nthe precise location is arbitrary.\nThe reversibility and precision of the thermodynamic in-\ntegration process are very sensitive to the choice of cleaving\npotentials. The requirements for the cleaving potential are\ntwo-fold: First, the cleaving potential should perturb the sys-ownloaded 19 Aug 2013 to 143.210.121.140. This article is copyrighted as indicated in the abstractem as little as possible. As a consequence, it is desirable\nthat, in step 2, the potential introduces structure into the\ncleaved liquid that is compatible with the structure of the\ncrystal layers. Second, the cleaving potential must be strong\nenough to prevent the particles from crossing the cleaving\nplane. Otherwise, the rearrangement of the boundary condi-\ntions in step 3 cannot be performed.\nBroughton and Gilmer14 carefully designed a set of\ncleaving potentials for the truncated LJ system. However,\ntheir approach for constructing the cleaving potential was\noptimized specifically for the LJ system and is not easily\nadaptable to a general case. Here we outline an approach that\nis easily adaptable to systems with different interparticle in-\nteraction potentials and different crystal structures.\nAs was demonstrated in our recent calculation of the\ninterfacial free energy for the hard-sphere system,9 the ap-\npropriate structure in the interfacial region of the fluid can be\neasily introduced by the potential of a pair of \u2018\u2018cleaving\nwalls\u2019\u2019 ~labeled 1 and 2!, made of properly oriented crystal\nlayers, each interacting only with the particles on the oppo-\nsite side of the cleaving plane. The wall particles are held\nfixed at the crystal lattice sites. When the two walls are far\naway from the cleaving plane, they do not interact with the\nsystem. Moving the walls closer to the cleaving plane intro-\nduces a cleaving potential whose structure is similar to that\noutside the crystal layers of the studied system. When a liq-\nuid system interacts with such a cleaving wall, it is expected\nto form an interfacial layer structure similar to that at the\ncrystal\u2013liquid interface. To achieve this, the interaction po-\nFIG. 1. An illustration of the four-step reversible process of creating the\ncrystal\u2013liquid interface from separate bulk systems.

Chem. Phys., Vol. 118, No. 16, 22 April 2003 Crystal-melt interfacial free energies\nDtential of the wall particles must be similar to that of the\nsystem particles.\nSince interactions in the crystal are usually dominated by\nthe short-range repulsive part of the potential, it is sufficient\nto choose the interaction potential of the wall particles as a\nmonotonically decreasing function f(r) with a relatively\nsmall cut-off radius rw , which models the repulsive core of\nthe interparticle potential in the system under investigation.\nAn interaction of the system with each cleaving wall is then\ngiven by\nF1~r;z !5(j f~ ur2Rj\n~1 !1nzu!,\n~1!\nF2~r;z !5(j f~ ur2Rj\n~2 !2nzu!,\nwhere Rj\n(1,2) are the positions of the particles forming the\nwalls, n is a unit vector normal to the cleaving plane, and z\nmeasures the distance of the walls to the cleaving plane.\nNext, we need to ensure that the system on the one side\nof the cleaving plane interacts only with the wall on the other\nside of the plane. To achieve this, we use the monotonic\ncharacter of the potential f(r) and define the cleaving po-\ntential as the minimum of the two wall potentials, namely,\nF~r;z !5min~F1 ,F2!, ~2!\nwhich decays to zero away from the cleaving plane, as long\nas the potential f(r) is chosen to be a positive monotoni-\ncally decreasing function. It is a simple exercise to show that\nthe vector arguments defined in Eq. ~1! combined with the\nminimum function defined above guarantees that each par-\nticle interacts with the proper wall. To remove discontinuity\nof the gradient of F at the points where F15F2 , we slightly\nmodify the minimum function as follows:\nm~x ,y !5H x , x<y2d~x1y !,y , x>y1d~x1y !,\np~x ,y !, otherwise,\n~3!\nwith\np~x ,y !5\nx1y\n4 ~22d!2\n~x2y !2\n4d~x1y ! , ~4!\nand parameter d characterizing the relative width of the in-\nterpolation region. We set d50.25 for the present study. The\ncleaving potential is defined as\nF~r;z !5m~F1 ,F2!. ~5!\nEven though the crystal system does not require addi-\ntional ordering and, as proposed by Broughton and Gilmer,\ncan be cleaved with a short-range repulsive potential cen-\ntered at the cleaving plane, we have found that using the\nsame cleaving potential for both crystal and liquid systems\nminimizes the error during the thermodynamic integration\nin step 3.ownloaded 19 Aug 2013 to 143.210.121.140. This article is copyrighted as indicated in the abstracTo calculate the reversible work in steps 1, 2, and 4, we\ncan use the wall position z as the integration coordinate. The\nreversible work is thus determined by evaluating the integral,\nw1,2,452E\nzi\nz f K ]F]z L dz , ~6!\nwhere the angle brackets denote averaging over a simulation\nrun at a fixed cleaving wall position. In steps 1 and 2, the\ninitial position of the cleaving walls, zi , is just outside the\nrange of the interaction potential determined by the cut-off\nradius rw . The final wall position z f is determined by the\nrequirement that the cleaving potential is sufficiently strong\nto prevent the particles from crossing the cleaving plane. In\nstep 4, the initial and final positions of the walls are reversed.\nBecause of the repulsive character of the cleaving potential,\nthe work in steps 1 and 2 is expected to be positive, while in\nstep 4 it is negative.\nIn step 3, the boundary conditions are gradually rear-\nranged using a coupling parameter l.

This potential has a continuous\nfirst derivative and a small discontinuity in its second deriva-\ntive at r52.3s .\nTo achieve optimal performance of the simulation at all\nstages of the cleaving process, we use a cell-assisted force\nevaluation method.16 The simulation region is subdivided\ninto cells with edge sizes just exceeding the interatomic in-\nteraction range. When atoms are assigned to cells according\nto their current position, only interactions between atoms in\nthe same cell or in immediately adjacent cells needs to be\nconsidered. Such a method is particularly useful in step 3,\nwhere interaction forces must be computed for two different\nboundary conditions @see Eq. ~7!#. With the cell-assisted\nmethod the additional computational effort is limited to the\ncell layers immediately adjacent to the cleaving planes.\n~Note: the cell subdivision is carried out in such a way that\nthe cell boundary coincides with the cleaving plane.!\nSince the insertion of the exteral cleaving potentials\n~\u2018\u2018walls\u2019\u2019! breaks the translational symmetry of the system\nHamiltonian, and linear momentum is no longer strictly con-\nserved. This leads to a problem for long runs in that the\ncrystal, taken as a whole, can drift relative to the cleaving\nplane. To prevent this, we immobilize the innermost two\ncrystal layers by assigning them an infinite mass. In the data-\ncollection runs these fixed planes were about 20 crystal lay-\ners away from the nearest crystal\u2013melt interface, and should\nnot have a significant effect on the interfacial properties. To\ncheck this, we have performed smaller simulations with an\nidentical cross-sectional area, but fewer crystal layers ~where\nthe interface is about 12\u201314 crystal layers distant from the\nfixed planes! and obtain results identical, within simulation\nerror, to the larger systems.\nFor the present study, we calculate g at both the triple\npoint temperature of T*[kBT\/e50.617 ~as determined by\nBroughton and Gilmer17!, and at higher temperatures\n(kBT\/e51.0 and 1.5!.

If the initial conditions are shifted from those at coex-\nistence, such a system equilibrates itself through melting\/\nfreezing at the interfaces. During the runs, the pressure\ntensor profiles18 are monitored and the simulation box res-\ncaled, if necessary, to remove any stress in the bulk crystal.\nThe equations of motion are integrated using the velocity-\nVerlet algorithm19 with the step sizes Dt50.005, 0.004, and\n0.003 @in units of (ms2\/e)1\/2, where m is the particle mass#,\nfor the simulations at temperatures T*50.617, 1.0, and 1.5,\nrespectively.\nAt each of the three temperatures, we calculate the inter-\nfacial free energy for three crystal orientations: @100#, @110#,\nand @111#. For step 1, the crystal system is prepared by plac-\ning particles in the ideal crystal configuration with random\ninitial velocities and running the simulation for 5000 time\nsteps, rescaling the velocities every 1000 steps to reach the\nequilibrium state at the specified temperature. The scaling\nfactor is determined from the value of the average kinetic\nenergy per particle during the preceding 1000 steps. The size\n(Lx ,Ly ,Lz) and number of particles (Nc) for systems with\ndifferent orientations are as follows:\n\u2022 @100#: Lx5Ly59a , Lz520a , Nc56480;\n\u2022 @110#: Lx56&a\u20198.5a , Ly59a ,\nLz512&a\u201917a , Nc55184;\n\u2022 @111#: Lx55.5&a\u20197.8a , Ly53A6a\u201957.3a ,\nLz512)a\u201920.8a , Nc54752;\nwhere a5(4\/rc)1\/3 is the size of the fcc unit cell, approxi-\nmately equal to 1.618s, 1.585s, and 1.550s, for the tem-\nperatures T*50.617, 1.0, and 1.5, respectively. These sizes\ncorrespond to 162, 108, and 132 particles per crystal layer\nfor the @100#, @110#, and @111# interfaces, respectively. The\ntotal area of the crystal\u2013liquid interface that is formed after\nstep 4 is equal to A52LxLy .\nTo form the liquid system for step 2, we start with an\nideal crystal block of exactly the same size and number of\nparticles as in step 1, and then remove particles at random to\nreduce the density from rc to r l . Thus, the number of par-\nticles in the liquid system is equal to the nearest integer of\nNcr l \/rc . The equilibration run of 10 000 steps is then per-\nformed, which is sufficient to reach the equilibrium liquid\nstate with the given temperature and density.

The cleaving wall is constructed from a\nsingle crystal layer for the @100# and @111# orientations and\nfrom two layers for the @110# orientation ~this was necessary\nto prevent atoms from crossing through this non-close-\npacked face!. As discussed in the previous section, the cleav-\ning potential f(r) is constructed from the repulsive core of\nthe LJ potential, which we define using a standard\nWeeks\u2013Chandler\u2013Anderson23 splitting:\nf~r !5H 4eF S sr D 122S sr D 6G1e , r,rw521\/6s ,\n0, rw<r .\n~11!\nIn steps 1 and 2 the cleaving potential is gradually intro-\nduced by changing the value of z in Eq. ~5! from zi to z f ,\ntypically in increments of 0.02s ~see Fig. 2!, with the initial\nsystem state for the new value of z being the final state from\nthe previous z value. In our simulations, the initial z value, zi\nis 1.1s ~which is large enough to ensure that the walls do not\ninteract with any particles in the system so that the insertion\nwork is zero!, and the final value, z f , varies from 0.50 to\n0.64 depending upon the orientation and temperature of the\ninterfacial system\u2014this is chosen to be large enough that the\ntwo sides are permanently separated. At each z an equilibra-\ntion run of 3000 steps is followed by 25 000 steps used to\ncalculate the average value and statistical error of ]F\/]z . As\nin the initial equilibration runs, the velocities are rescaled\nevery 1000 steps to retain a constant value of the tempera-\nture. For an illustration of the method we show in Fig. 2 the\nthermodynamic integration integrand for steps 1, 2, and 4 for\nthe @111# interface at T*50.617 ~using z f50.62).

This article is copyrighted as indicated in the abstracare calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The results are sum-\nmarized in Table II. To test system size effects, we have\nrepeated the calculations for systems that are about half the\ninterfacial area and a third shorter ~e.g., 6a36a312a for\n@100#!. The values of the integrands for the smaller systems\nwere within the error bars of those for the larger systems.\nEven though the relative statistical accuracy that can be\nachieved for a given duration of the simulation run is about\nthe same for all temperatures and orientations ~approxi-\nmately 0.5%!, we see that the relative error range in Table II\nincreases with the temperature, especially for the @111# ori-\nentation. This increase is due to the observation that revers-\nibility ~as measured by the lack of hysteresis! of the thermo-\ndynamic integration process for the LJ system is more\ndifficult to achieve for higher temperatures.\nThere are two sources of potential hysteresis in the four-\nstep process of creating an interface. The first one is associ-\nated with the liquid ordering transition that occurs either at\nthe end of step 2, or at the beginning of step 3. For lower\ntemperatures, the hysteresis can be essentially eliminated by\nincreasing the duration of the equilibration runs near the\npoint of transition. However, the hysteresis for higher tem-\nperatures is more persistent, especially in the case of the\n@111# orientation. This may be due to a particular choice of\nthe cleaving potential. More research is necessary to eluci-\ndate the origin of the hysteresis and ways to eliminate it.\nFIG. 3. Integrand for thermodynamic integration in step 3 for the @111#\ninterface at T*50.617.

When the cleaving\npotential is removed from the interfacial system in step 4, the\nposition of the interface is no longer tied to the cleaving\nplane. Because the system contains two interfaces, they can\nchange their position without disturbing system equilibrium\nby the process of melting at one interface and simultaneous\nfreezing at the other interface. The difficulty in verifying the\nreversibility of step 4 is that the mobility of the interfaces\ncauses the reverse process to follow a slightly different ther-\nmodynamic integration path. To deal with this problem, we\ntry the reverse step 4 process on the interfacial systems after\nseveral equilibration runs of various duration and select the\none with the path closest to the forward process. The differ-\nence in the calculated work during the forward and reverse\nprocesses is accounted for in the estimate of the error range\ngiven in Table II.\nIV. ANALYSIS AND SUMMARY\nThe error bars on the calculations described above are\nsmall enough to resolve the anisotropy in the interfacial free\nenergy for the Lennard-Jones system. While we have deter-\nmined g only for the @100#, @110#, and @111# directions, it is\npossible to extract from these data some information as to\nthe full angular dependence of the free energy. Defining the\norientation unit vector n\u02c6 as the unit vector perpendicular to\nthe interfacial plane, one defines an orientation dependent\ninterfacial free energy g(n\u02c6), which can be parametrized by\nan expansion in terms of cubic harmonics. One such expan-\nsion, due to Fehlner and Vosko,20 has been recently applied\nto the interfacial free energy of Ni\/Cu alloys by Asta et al.21\nIn terms of the Cartesian components of n\u02c65$n1 ,n2 ,n3%, this\nexpansion ~truncated at sixth-order! is\ng~ n\u02c6!5g0F11e1S (\ni51\n3\nni\n42\n3\n5 D\n1e2S (\ni51\n3\nni\n4166n1\n2n2\n2n3\n22\n17\n7 D G , ~12!\nwhere g0 is the orientationally averaged interfacial free en-\nergy and e1 and e2 are expansion coefficients. This param-\netrization has an advantage over the so-called \u2018\u2018Kubic Har-\nmonic\u2019\u2019 expansion22 that has been used recently to\nparametrize free energy anisotropy in metals10,11 in that the\nexpansion terms are orthogonal.21 For the orientations stud-\nied here this expansion becomes 143.210.121.140.

Also included in Table III are the\nvalues of (g1002g110)\/g0 and (g1002g111)\/g0 , which also\nserve to quantify the anisotropy. The error bars in g0 are\nsmaller than those for the raw interfacial free energies since\ng0 represents a weighted average of similar numbers\u2014a pro-\ncess that decreases statistical error. The anisotropy param-\neters represent differential quantities involving differences\nbetween similar numbers ~which magnifies relative error! so\nthe relative error bars for those quantities are larger than in\nthe raw data. This is in contrast to the fluctuation method21\nwhere the relative error in the interfacial free energy is larger\nthan in the current study ~despite the much larger systems!,\nbut the anisotropy parameters are more precisely determined\ndue to the fact that in that method the anisotropy is deter-\nmined from the anisotropy in the interfacial stiffness, which\nis far greater than that of the interfacial free energy itself.\nFrom the anisotropy parameters given in Table III, the\ntrend is observed that the anisotropy parameters increase in\nmagnitude with increasing temperature, with e1 becoming\nmore positive and e2 becoming more negative. In compari-\nson with the hard-sphere values, the value of e2 approaches\nthe hard-sphere value as T gets larger, but the value of e1 ,\nwhich is at T*50.617 quite close to the hard-sphere value,\ndiverges away from the hard-sphere value as T increases.

Phys., Vol. 118, No. 16, 22 April 2003 Crystal-melt interfacial free energies\nDcourse, in the limit of high temperatures, the Lennard-Jones\nsystem approaches an inverse 12th power repulsive potential,\nnot the hard-sphere potential, so one would expect the high-\ntemperature behavior of the anisotropy to approach that of\nthe former potential. This implies that any perturbation\ntheory for the interfacial free energy with a hard-sphere ref-\nerence potential will not be adequate to predict anisotropy,\nand that a study of the anisotropy for a variety of different\npossible repulsive potentials would be very useful.\nIn recent work,13 we have pointed out that the interfacial\nfree energy for simple systems with face-centered cubic ~fcc!\ncrystal structures can be quantitatively described by a hard-\nsphere model. It is useful to check this hypothesis here, since\nthe LJ system is a standard molecular model that freezes to a\nfcc crystal, and since the interfacial free energy was deter-\nmined in this study directly and not indirectly from nucle-\nation data. The hard-sphere model predicts\ng0~HS!50.617kT\/s2, ~15!\nwhere s2 is the hard-sphere diameter. For our Lennard-Jones\nsystem we can define an effective ~temperature-dependent!\nhard-sphere diameter using the Barker\u2013Henderson\ncriterion23 from liquid-state perturbation theory,\nseff5E\n0\n\u2018\n$12exp@2ur~r !\/kT#%dr ,\nwhere ur(r) is the repulsive part of the potential, which we\ndefine in the Week\u2013Chandler\u2013Anderson sense23 as the full\npotential truncated ~and shifted! to zero beyond the mini-\nmum of the attractive well. This procedure yields values of\nseff of 1.032s, 1.016s, and 1.000s, for T*50.617, 1.0, and\n1.5, respectively. Inserting these values into Eq. ~15! yields\npredicted values of g0 ~in units of e\/s2) of 0.36, 0.60, and\n0.93, for T*50.617, 1.0, and 1.5, respectively. The agree-\nment with the values listed for LJ in Table III is excellent at\nthe lower temperature, but overestimates the actual value by\nseveral percent at the higher temperatures. This agreement\ngives more evidence to support the general hypothesis13 that\nthe interfacial free energy of close packed systems is largely\ndetermined by packing considerations, not energy.\nIt is interesting to note that the anisotropy parameters e1\nand e2 for the truncated LJ potential at the triple point (T*ownloaded 19 Aug 2013 to 143.210.121.140.

The fact that the parameters are exactly the same for\nthese two ~essentially! zero pressure systems is, given the\nerror bars, probably coincidental; however, the data does\nshow that the anisotropy for Ni is better modelled by a LJ\npotential than by a hard-sphere potential. More study is re-\nquired to determine the exact role that details of the potential\nplay in determining interfacial anisotropy.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was performed using the University of Le-\nicester Mathematical Modelling Center\u2019s supercomputer,\nwhich was purchased through the EPSRC strategic equip-\nment initiative.
