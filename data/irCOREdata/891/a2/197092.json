More specifically, I take a closer look at how old and new \ninstitutional logics interact, how \u201cchange agents\u201d are structurally embedded, and how it is \npossible for an institutional logic to emerge without a corresponding institution. \n \n \nKey words: Abelard, Bourdieu, institutional change, institutional emergence, institutional \nlogics, Middle Ages, paradox of embedded agency \n \n \n10997 words \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 2 \nInstitutional change and emergence have been widely discussed in neo-institutionalist \nsociology since the mid-1990s (among others, Beckert 1999; Clemens and Cook 1999; \nHoffman 1999, 2001; Misangyi, Weaver, and Elms 2008; Seo and Creed 2002). Following \nFriedland and Alford\u2019s (1991) seminal paper, a number of authors (e.g. DiMaggio 1997; \nMisangyi, Weaver, and Elms 2008; Patriotta and Lanzara 2006; Thornton and Ocasio 2008) \nhave focused on the role of institutional logics in institutional change, while others have \nstressed the importance of power (e.g. Lawrence 2008; Lok and Willmott 2006; Rao, Morrill, \nand Zald 2000), actors (e.g. Beckert 1999; Dorado 2005; Hardy and Maguire 2008) and \nmeanings (e.g. Munir 2005; Zilber 2008). Bourdieu\u2019s name has been mentioned in connection \nwith these concerns, but very few papers (most notably, Battilana 2006) have actually used his \ntheory as an analytical framework for institutional change. Despite this reluctance, I believe \nhim to be a very important author who can integrate the different strands of institutional \nlogics, power, actors and meanings. His notion of fields, furthermore, shows how social actors \nthat are structurally embedded in a field can nevertheless arrive at new ideas for change and \nreflect on structures that they had hitherto taken for granted \u2013 a topic that has occupied neo-\ninstitutionalist sociology under the label \u201cparadox of embedded agency\u201d (among others, \nBeckert 1999; Greenwood and Suddaby 2006; Mutch 2007; Garud, Hardy, and Maguire \n2007). The paper at hand is aimed at substantiating these claims by using Bourdieu within a \nneo-institutionalist framework to analyse of the emergence of an institution. More \nspecifically, I take a closer look at how old and new institutional logics interact, how \u201cchange \nagents\u201d are structurally embedded, and how it is possible for an institutional logic to emerge \nwithout a corresponding institution. \n \nIn the case study, I have researched into the foundation of the University of Paris in the latter \nhalf of the 12th century. The University of Paris not only was the most prestigious university \nin the Middle Ages but also became the role model after which all later European universities \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 3 \nwere fashioned. By choosing such a temporally distant foundation process, I try to leave \nbehind modern assumptions concerning institutions and institution building and focus on the \noverall characteristics of the process. Modernity, as Zucker (1983) states, is characterised by \nan institutional self-dynamics with more and more institutions being established in more and \nmore areas of life. This ubiquity of institutions, I believe, may sometimes prevent us from \ndistinguishing institutional processes from other processes, for example organizational or \nentrepreneurial ones. In contrast, my focus on the Middle Ages \u2013 a time with a comparatively \nlow degree of institutionalisation \u2013 may draw the contours more clearly. I will describe the \nfoundation of the University of Paris as an analytical narrative. My sources are both primary \nand secondary. The 12th century is, of course, much more poorly documented than modern \ntimes. Still, with regard to my specific research topic, we are lucky to have an autobiography \nof one of the key actors \u2013 Abelard\u2019s Historia Calamitatum \u2013 and about one million words of \nhis philosophical writings. The autobiography, as all autobiographies, follows the rules of the \ngenre and thus cannot be taken as a pure report of facts. However, as it was published in \nAbelard\u2019s lifetime, we may assume that he could not diverge too much from the truth, and \nindeed modern scholars have yet to find an outright lie in his account. Apart from Abelard\u2019s \nwritings in the Latin original and a German (Abaelard 1987) and English translation (Abelard \n1972), I have used small extracts from other original sources, but have mostly relied on the \nworks of established modern scholars of medieval history and philosophy. Thus, for \nuniversity history, I draw on Cobban (1971), Koeppler (1939), Le Goff (1986), M\u00fcller (1996), \nGabriel (1969) and R\u00fcegg (1992) as well as on three classics, Denifle (1885), Compayr\u00e9 \n(1893) and Rashdall (1886, 1936), for scholastic philosophy, on Clanchy (2000), Flasch \n(1987), Schmidinger (1992) and Makdisi (1974), for Abelard, on Clanchy (2000), Compayr\u00e9 \n(1893) and LeGoff (1986). \n \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 4 \nIn the following sections, I will first discuss the theoretical model I have used for the analysis. \nI will then provide some context information on the 12th century. After this introduction, I will \nelaborate on the key elements of my model and the connexions between them in terms of my \nempirical data. Finally, the emergence of the institution and implications for modern \ninstitutions will be discussed. \n \nTHE MODEL OF MISANGYI, WEAVER AND ELMS \n \nAs a theoretical starting point, I want to base my paper on the model of institutional change \nby Misangyi, Weaver and Elms (2008) (Figure 1), who in turn base their model on insights \nfrom Giddens\u2019s structuration theory and Bourdieu\u2019s notion of capital. The model shows the \nrecursive interplay of institutional logics, actors and resources. For Misangyi, Weaver and \nElms, institutional logics comprise a symbolic level providing identity and meaning, an \nintermediate level providing schemas, roles and rules, and a substantive level of practices and \nactions. Social actors, as specified by structuration theory, are enabled and constrained by an \ninstitutional logic. At the same time, their actions promote and reproduce the logic. In order to \nact, the actors need resources in the form of economic, cultural, symbolic and social capital. \nThe value of the particular form of capital is, in turn, defined by the logic. In the case of \ninstitutional change, new social actors with different interests promote and draw on a different \nor new logic and on different(ly valued) resources. The ensuing conflict is inherently political. \nIts outcome depends on the ability of the attackers and defenders to mobilise support and \nresources for their stance and on the plausibility and consistency of the new logic.  \n \nINSERT Figure 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 5 \nWhile I agree with Misangyi et al. that logics, actors and resources form the key elements of \ninstitutional change, I should like to modify their model in a number of respects. First, I want \nto show that there is a connexion between the symbolic level of the old and the symbolic level \nof the new logic to the extent that the emergence of the new logic reforms the old logic. \nSecond, I want to include the structural context of the social actors, which is only briefly \nalluded to by the phrase \u201csocial actors empowered by existing structure\u201d. This is where \nBourdieu\u2019s concept of the field becomes useful. Third, I should like to address the question \nhow an institutional logic can form without a corresponding institution. This question might \nbe asked legitimately if we analyse the emergence of new institutions rather than, as Misangyi \net al. do, institutional change. Connected to that specific case is the question of where the \ncircle portrayed in the model starts. If we define an institution as \u201cexerting patterned higher-\norder effects on the actions, indeed the constitution, of individuals and organizations without \nrequiring repeated collective mobilization and authoritative intervention to achieve these \nregularities\u201d (Clemens and Cook 1999, :444f.), then there was not a \u201cnew\u201d institution in sight \nat the time the new institutional logic started to emerge. In other words, can there be an \ninstitutional logic without an institution? \n \nBefore I identify the major elements \u2013 logics, practices and resources \u2013 for the foundation of \nthe University of Paris in answer to these questions, I will briefly sketch the relevant historical \ndevelopments. \n \nTHE FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY: CULTURAL AND POLITICAL \nCONTEXT \n \n\u201cA complete history of the universities of the Middle Ages would be in fact a history of \nmedieval thought\u2026\u201d(Rashdall 1936, :3). The university as we know it today has its origins in \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 6 \nthe Middle Ages; it may, in fact, be its proudest cultural \u201cinvention\u201d. While later universities \nwere founded by decree (ex privilegio) and have thus a clearly marked beginning, the oldest \nuniversities grew slowly out of custom (ex consuetudine) \u2013 a much more interesting process \nfrom an institutionalist perspective. Among these, the universities of Paris and Bologna are \nconsidered the first, both with regard to age and importance. No exact date or founding \ndocument can be established for them, but they served as models for subsequent universities \n(see Table 1). I will limit my research to the University of Paris, whose magisterial and \nfaculty organization still lies at the basis of modern universities, and to the latter half of the \n12th century, where this university emerged as a recognisable organisation.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nBefore we start with this particular time and place, however, I think it is necessary to dispel \nsome clich\u00e9s and prejudices that modernity has cultivated vis-\u00e0-vis the Middle Ages. The 11th \nand 12th centuries were a time of rupture and transformation. European population doubled \nbetween 1050 and 1200 leaving a huge number of people without subsistence and \ninfrastructure (Herlihy 1971; LeGoff 1986). Traditional institutions did not just fade; they \nburst, creating insecurity and disillusion. Families could not provide for their children (except \nthe firstborn), and the community had no place or work for them either. People started moving \naround, sometimes banding together for criminal purposes, but often as vagantes, a group that \nalso formed a vociferous part of the students of the time. The contemporary vulgar songs and \ntroubadour lyrics were full of irony and parody rejecting the Church and its magnates, the \nking, religious practices and Christian marriage. At the same time, the frustration was also \nvented against perceived outsiders. In 1007, the first heretics were burnt, and the first crusade \nstarted in 1096. Towards the end of this period, however, new societal forms began to take \nshape: Cities rose, and with them the new classes of merchants, bankers, craftsmen, artists, \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 7 \nand university teachers. Guilds were formed, and in the nobility the feudal system was further \ndeveloped. In fact, many authors use the term \u201crenaissance\u201d to describe the remarkable \ncultural, intellectual and institutional achievements of the 12th century.  \n \nThe Catholic Church, in whose lap the universities were to develop, was not unaffected by the \nturmoil. Its monasteries, the traditional places of learning, had been following the rule of St. \nBenedict, but came under increasing critique for not being sincere and strict enough. The 11th \ncentury saw a serious crisis of the atrophied monasteries (Suso Frank 1987). This \ndissatisfaction found two outlets. The first was for monks to leave the monastery altogether \nand live as hermits in the forests. The second were the reformation movements of Cluny and \nlater Citeaux, which aimed at \u201crestoring\u201d the monastic ideal of austerity and asceticism.  \n \nThe pre-university stage \n \nThe high mobility of the population was a boon for the growing cities. However, if people did \nnot want to settle and become citizens, but move on after a certain time, the lack of citizenship \nhad serious consequences. Basically, these non-citizens had no rights and no means to act in a \nlegally meaningful way. The problem was the same for merchants as for university teachers \nand students, and they responded with the same solution, viz. by forming an association or \nguild. This association was called \u201cuniversitas\u201d and referred to any trade, not just university \npeople. The guild of the masters was called \u201cuniversitas magistrorum\u201d. \n \nIn the middle of the 12th century, the monasteries still taught as they always had, but mostly \ndid so in the countryside. In the cities, cathedral schools had emerged for the same purpose. \nAt Paris, there were three: the cathedral school of Notre-Dame, the cloister of Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve \nand the cloister St. Victor. Ste. Genevi\u00e8ve was the home of the Artists, Notre-Dame of \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 8 \nmainstream theology, and St. Victor of mystical theology. (Note that \u201chome\u201d does not refer to \nany building in particular as teaching went on wherever master and students agreed to meet.) \nMost masters and students had clerical status and were under Church jurisdiction. With the \nrise of the cities in the 11th and 12th century, city schools gained importance over monastic \nschools in the countryside. And with the elevation of Paris as the capital of a quickly \nexpanding kingdom, the schools of Paris gained an advantage over other renowned schools, \nsuch as Laon or Chartres. This led to a concentration of famous teachers at Paris, which in \nturn brought masses of students to the city. \n \nScholastic migration to Paris began at the end of the 11th century with William of Champeaux \nas the first Parisian master to attract students from abroad. The upsurge, however, that was to \ncatapult Paris into being the intellectual centre of Europe and to make its new university the \nfirst among equals was triggered by his pupil Peter Abelard.  \n \nAbelard \n \n\u201cThe man who, by his qualities and his defects, by the audacity of his opinions, the \u00e9clat of \nhis life, his inborn passion for controversy, and his rare talent for instructions, contributes \nmost to increase and expand the taste for study and that intellectual movement from which \nthe University of Paris issued in the 13th century, was Peter Abelard.\u201d (Cousin, 1836 \nquoted in Compayr\u00e9 1893, :4) \n \n\u201cPeter Abelard (1079-1142) was the pre-eminent philosopher of the twelfth century and \nperhaps the greatest logician of the middle ages. [\u2026] In all areas Abelard was brilliant, \ninnovative, and controversial. He was a genius. He knew it, and made no apologies. His \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 9 \nvast knowledge, wit, charm, and even arrogance drew a generation of Europe's finest \nminds to Paris to learn from him.\u201d (Guilfoy 2007) \n \nThe pivotal role of Abelard in the founding of the University of Paris is undisputed. Abelard \ncame to Paris to study with William of Champeaux, one of the most renowned masters of \nLogics at the time. His talent for Logics showed quickly, and he soon started challenging \nWilliam by offering lectures himself. This was not only a breach of etiquette, but a formal \noffence as Abelard had not yet acquired magisterial status. William had him barred from \nteaching in Paris, so Abelard moved to Corbeil near Paris taking a considerable number of \nWilliam\u2019s students with him. His fame as a teacher of Logics grew, and after a while he \ndecided to move on to the \u201ccrown discipline\u201d, Theology. He went to Laon to study under \nAnselm, again one of the most renowned masters of this particular discipline. Again he soon \nchallenged Anselm, attracted his students, and was forced to leave Laon. On his return to \nParis this time, Abelard\u2019s reputation had grown so much that he enjoyed a status far more \ncomparable to modern-day celebrities than to a \u201cserious\u201d philosopher: \n \n\u201cWhat king or philosopher could equal your fame? What kingdom or city or village did not \nlong to see you? Who would not rush to set eyes on you when you appeared in public and \ncrane their necks after you? What married woman, what young girl did not desire you in \nabsence and was not on fire in your presence?\u201d (Heloise, quoted in Clanchy 1997, :1) \n \nWhile many of his professorial colleagues did not like his thoughts and style, success made \nhim quite invulnerable. By drawing crowds of students \u2013 Compayr\u00e9 (1893) estimates 5000 -, \nAbelard himself became financially independent, but it seems that the worldly and \necclesiastical powers also appreciated what these crowds did to their budget and reputation. \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 10 \nIntellectually, there was no one in sight to challenge him either. This auspicious situation \ncame to an end when Abelard seduced his pupil Heloise and in consequence was ambushed \nand castrated by members of her family. \n \nIn the wake of this public \u2013 indeed, internationally noted \u2013 humiliation, Abelard (always \nfollowed by his students) retired to a monastery, but left after some serious disputes with the \nmonks and started his own small community. Apart from teaching, he concentrated on writing \ntheological treatises. These brought him into direct conflict with Bernhard of Clairvaux, the \nright hand man of the Pope, advisor to the King of France and the most powerful man in \necclesiastical Europe. Bernhard managed to get Abelard\u2019s books publicly condemned and \nburnt twice. On the latter occasion, Abelard was also excommunicated. He found sanctuary at \nthe Abbey of Cluny, whose abbot Petrus Venerabilis was himself a powerful man and no \nfriend of Bernhard\u2019s. Abelard spent his last days at Cluny \u2013 still writing and re-writing his \ntreatises - and died there in 1142. \n \nThe emergence of the university \n \nAs mentioned before, there is no clear date or knowledge of a foundational act regarding the \nUniversity of Paris. However, it can be noted that the transition from single Parisian \norganisation to model for a European institution happened quite quickly.  In the course of the \n12th century, Parisian schools grew together, masters associated, and by the beginning of the \n13th century, we can glimpse the first organizational structures and artefacts, such as \nhierarchies or curricula (see Table 2). Certain characteristics, rights and practices of the \nuniversity as an organisation then became institutionalised patterns, not only for Paris, but \nwherever new universities were founded. In this way, Paris became the model university for \nall other European universities.  \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 11 \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe foundation process in Paris seems to have been triggered by the masses of students \narriving in the city. Let us recall: massive population growth had shaken the foundations of \nEuropean societies, students were often migrant, in fact rootless, and displayed a tendency for \nrioting and disrespect of authorities. These students entered Paris, found themselves a teacher, \nstudied for a while, and moved on. Fed by the demand, schools and individual teaching \nmushroomed, each with its own syllabus, method and practices. In this situation the Church \nand the City of Paris as well as masters already teaching at Paris had a common interest, viz. \nto regulate and organise the quickly expanding chaos. The City fathers wanted a legal unity to \naddress and hold responsible, the existing masters some regulations to stifle competition and \nco-opt new colleagues, while the Bishop of Paris sought to retain control of the education. \nThus, in 1150, all private schools were forced under his jurisdiction. In consequence, it seems \nthat the foundation of the University of Paris started with a locally negotiated compromise \nbetween the city powers. The university, however, soon attracted the interest of other powers \nas well \u2013 we will discuss this aspect in more detail later on.  \n \nTHE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE MODEL \n \nHaving presented the context, I should now like to return to my theoretical model discussing \nits key elements \u2013 logics, practices, resources - and the connexions between them. In short, I \nwill discuss how the two different logics of education were upheld by different social actors \u2013 \ndefenders and entrepreneurs respectively. We shall also see how the new logic led to a change \nin teaching practices and technologies, which in turn strengthened it. The struggle between the \ntwo logics, finally, also changed the value of the different types of capital, thus enabling the \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 12 \nentrepreneurs to build up their position. Figure 3 illustrates how the key elements fit into the \nscheme of Misangyi, Weaver and Elms. \n \nINSERT  Figure 3 ABOUT HERE \n \nLet us now take a closer look at the individual elements. \n \n \nInstitutional Logics of Medieval Education \n \nIn the case of the medieval university, we may identify different logics applying to the field of \nculture and education. The first and older one, which I will call \u201chermetic logic\u201d, viewed \nknowledge as a treasure, as something precious to be guarded, handled with care by a few \nselect people and kept away from the crowds. The beautifully illuminated manuscripts, \nuniques whose production took a lifetime, belong to this logic. It was the logic of the \nmonasteries, developed in the Dark Ages, when the monks clung to the few remnants of \nantique civilisation while around them the world fell apart. It was about repetition, about \ndevoting oneself to the copying of a text as a form of prayer instead of copying it quickly and \nefficiently. It was, in consequence, about texts being worth this effort, about holy texts or \ntexts far advanced in knowledge. It was about a religion of books, not just about religious \nbooks. It was about a society where few could read and few wanted to read for themselves, \nwhere the lectio, i.e. the reading from a book paired with an authoritative exegesis, was the \nsole method of teaching. It was also about technology, about books being made from animal \nskins and written in a script that, because of all its arabesques, was difficult to decipher. The \nmore so since, as space in books is precious, no spaces were left between single words.  \n \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 13 \nIn contrast, there was the new \u201cpublic logic\u201d of knowledge and teaching. This logic viewed \nknowledge as something to be accumulated and truth as something yet to be found \u2013 by a \nconcerted effort of all human beings capable and willing. The maxim of William of \nChampeaux at the beginning of the 12th century was: \u201cKnowledge when distributed \nincreases\u201d. This logic viewed reason as peer to the Bible and the Church Fathers when it came \nto understanding God and the world. It accepted the contradictions and shortcomings in the \nexplanations of the Church Fathers and elevated doubt to a methodological core element. It \nasked people \u2013 everybody - to read and think for themselves and, above all, to discuss matters \npublicly. At Paris, the episcopal and monastic schools opened their doors to the public and \nenrol \u201cexternal students\u201d. This logic viewed books as tools that should be available to \neveryone. \n \nNew Actors: The universitas magistrorum \n \nApart from Abelard, the second major actor in the foundation of the university was the \nuniversitas magistrorum, i.e. the association of masters. Although it lacks a number of \ncharacteristics of modern professions, we might regard it as a professional body of the 12th \ncentury. Like all professions1 at the time, it was organised as a guild. After Abelard\u2019s death, it \nseems to have been the collective identity as \u201cscholastics\u201d \u2013 i.e. practitioners of the scholastic \nmethod - that integrated the hitherto quite loosely and informally structured association. And \nit were those scholastics that carried Abelard\u2019s ideas on and across the gap of about a \ngeneration that we today perceive as lying between him and the founding of the University of \nParis. They were, and wanted to be, the \u201cmodernii\u201d, the people who believed in the power of \n                                                 \n1 A classification of the universitas in terms of my model is not easy as it can be regarded as \nan institution in its own right (for the role of professions as institutionalised agents, see Scott \n2008). I place my emphasis, however, with regard to the universitas on their continuing of the \nscholastic method as a teaching practice and thus on their role as collective actor. \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 14 \nreason, in dispute, and in people reading for themselves. With their activity, they established \nand promoted other professions as well, above all copyists and booksellers.   \n \nOn an institutional level, they recognised the need to break free from the Church\u2019s supervision \nand keep interference from the outside to a minimum. For that reason, they sought backing \nagainst the local ecclesiastical power, i.e. the Bishop of Paris and his chancellor, from powers \nthat were, in a sense, further away: the Pope in terms of geography, the King of France in \nterms of ideology.  \n \nNew Practices: The scholastic method \n \nLogic in the 12th century was taught according to the scholastic method. The scholastic \nmethod is dialectical presenting two opposing proposals in order to enter into a dispute about \nthem. Abelard\u2019s most famous treatise, which is lucidly titled \u201cSic et Non\u201d (Yes and No), was \nthe first scholarly document in the Occident to apply the method rigorously throughout a \nwhole text. \u201cSic et Non\u201d juxtaposes answers of the Church authorities thus showing that there \nis no consistent \u201csystem\u201d of Christian theology, and concluding that in such a situation reason \nmust decide which answer is the best. In terms of content, it is easy to see the rationalist \nundercurrent of the method and its zeal for dispute and doubt. In sociological terms, the \nmethod quickly became the standard teaching method of the cathedral schools, while the \nmonastic schools still clung to the older method of lectio. For the next century, \u201cdialectical\u201d \nwas synonymous to \u201cscholastic\u201d and to \u201cmodern\u201d (modernus). All three terms were not \nnecessarily positive; traditionalists used them unfailingly in a pejorative sense. The terms, \nhowever, provided the new masters and students of the cathedral schools with a collective \nidentity that was to play an important role in the founding of the new university. \n                                                                                                                                                        \n \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 15 \n \nAbelard\u2019s second major achievement was to apply the scholastic method, which hitherto had \nbeen restricted to logic and philosophy, to theology. In this sense, Abelard is the founder of \nscholastic theology \u2013 indeed, of the word \u201ctheology\u201d itself -, which was to dominate the \nMiddle Ages. In his time, however, this way of doing theology was far from undisputed. As \nwe have seen, there was a strong traditionalist, mostly hermetic and mystic movement that \nwanted the most divine to be left in peace and not be subjected to human inquiry. As \nBernhard of Clairvaux ranted against Abelard: \n \n\u201eThe faith of the simple is ridiculed, God\u2019s secrets are being torn out by the guts, questions \nabout the highest things are being recklessly aired.\u201d (Clanchy 1997, :7) \n \nThe rationalism underlying the scholastic method was mirrored in developments in other \nsocietal fields. Thus, for example, the law of the 12th century abandoned the trial by ordeal in \nfavour of more human-based ways of judging. While Bernhard preached the crusade, his \nopponent Petrus Venerabilis, abbot of Cluny, had the Koran translated to open a dialogue with \nIslam. Abelard\u2019s moral treatises argued that sin does not lie in desire, which is a natural force, \nbut in consenting to the desire, which is a rational act. This implied that a pagan clinging to \nhis belief because he did not know better did not sin and should not be punished. On broad \ncanvas, it might be argued that the \u201crenaissance\u201d of the 12th century, like its successor in the \n15th, abandoned a number of archaic-magical beliefs and opted for a more humanist and \nrationalist model of society and education. \n \nThe scepticism of the method appealed to all those who were disillusioned by existing \ninstitutions and their claims to truth and legitimacy. At a different time, it might have been \nlooked upon with suspicion, but as we have seen, the preceding 150 years had witnessed a lot \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 16 \nof doubt and disillusionment in very practical, everyday terms. The scholastic method \nprovided students with a legitimate method of \u201ctheorising\u201d their feelings and experiences, i.e. \nexpress them in commonly recognised abstract terms and models (for the importance of \ntheorising in practice diffusion see Zilber 2008).  \n \nFinally, if we accept that cultural systems construe actors by investing them with the authority \nto act (Meyer and Jepperson 2000), we can see how the scholastic method shifts the field of \nlegitimate power in education towards a more egalitarian structure. As it argued that reason \nand enquiry was the way to truth, and as this way was open to everybody, power moved away \nfrom those people that were hitherto thought to have sole access to the wisdom of the Church \nFathers and the Bible. This more egalitarian structure, although far from being perfectly \negalitarian, led to important changes concerning the core and the periphery of the field.  \n \nNew practices: Disputatio \n \nTraditionally, the lectio, the reading and exegesis of a text, had been at the centre of teaching. \nThe practice was focussed on the master who revealed his knowledge \u2013 or more precisely, the \nknowledge contained in the text \u2013 to his disciples. In the course of the 13th century, the lectio \nwas turned into the quaestio, a more active treatment of the text, in which the master or his \npupils confronted the text with questions of their own. The dialectical spirit permitted them to \ngo beyond the text in search of truth. The text, accordingly, moved into the background and \nbecame an occasion rather than a manifest. In the next stage, it disappeared altogether, and we \narrive at the disputatio, the text-free exchange of arguments between scholars. These \ndisputationes then became the core and pinnacle of scholarly engagement as they formed the \nmode of examination for the master degree, but also allowed the university to celebrate itself \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 17 \nin big public disputationes between renowned scholars that drew crowds from all over the \ncity. \n \nNew technology: Books  \n \nThe new logic and teaching practices also called for a change in tools, and fortunately, \ntechnology followed suit. Paper was introduced to Europe during this time (Frugoni 2008). In \ncomparison with the traditional calf skins, it was much cheaper in production. It was also \neasier to handle than the wax tablets used since antiquity to scribble words that were not \nmeant for eternity. However, not only the material changed. The format of books also did \n(LeGoff 1986): from the huge and unwieldy tomes displayed at altars and in monasteries \nbooks developed into handbooks in the literal sense of the word. These books could be carried \naround and consulted at will. Writers exchanged reeds for quills. Using the simpler Gothic \nminuskel in place of the calligraphic Carolingian minuskel (see Figure 2), they sped up \nwriting. They also left spaces between words, which facilitated reading, and added \nalphabetical listings and tables of content to their works.  \n \nINSERT FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nNew professions appeared around reading and writing (LeGoff 1986). Most important for the \nuniversities were the copyists who copied the official lecture texts (exemplares). They, \ntogether with booksellers and professional writers, enjoyed the same privileges as other \nmembers of the university and were under university jurisdiction. Finally, now that reading \nfor yourself became important, eyeglasses were invented at the turn of 13th century. \n \nResources as capitals \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 18 \n \nSimilar to Hardy and Maguire\u2019s (2008) notion of institutional context, Bourdieu\u2019s (Bourdieu \nand Wacquant 1996; 1992, 1990, 1984) conceptualisation of the field directs our attention \ntowards the relational qualities of a process or situation. In a field, actors are linked to one \nanother through asymmetrical power relations. The symbolic and material resources - \nBourdieu\u2019s \u201ccapitals\u201d - determine the actor\u2019s position in the field because they specify how \nmuch he or she can \u201cinvest\u201d to promote his or her interests. Unequal capital distributions as \nwell as shared social distinctions create a topography of the field in which each actor occupies \nhis or her unique position. The position determines the opportunities and constraints each \nactor faces. This can be formalised \u2013 though not quantified \u2013 through the following equation: \n \nPower position of social actor = \u03a3for all types of capital (value of capital * actor\u2019s amount of capital)  \n \nWhile each type of capital may be accumulated and thus increase in quantity, the value of \neach type is linked to the other types to create a sort of \u201cexchange rate\u201d because the types can \nbe converted into each other, for example in learning when economic capital is invested to \nacquire cultural capital. As a consequence, actors may accumulate a certain type of capital but \nstill become poorer overall as this type loses value in comparison with other types. Vice versa, \npreviously less well endowed actors may suddenly find their fortunes reversed by such a \nchange in the exchange rate. One important implication of this theory is, however, that \ninstitutional change cannot be brought about from the periphery of the field as actors there do \nnot have the capital to make change happen. Rather, we might assume that actors that used to \nlive at the periphery, for whatever reasons, find themselves suddenly at the disposal of \nvaluable capital and move, temporarily or permanently, to the centre of the field. Thus \nAbelard got propelled to the centre by his leading position in the Goliard movement \u2013 social \ncapital \u2013 and his skills in winning philosophical and theological debates \u2013 cultural capital. \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 19 \nBoth forms of capital had only recently been recognised as valuable, which explains why \nAbelard could act the moment he did although he was not part of the establishment. With \nregard to the emergent perspective, it also emphasises the fact that, important though Abelard \nas an individual was, his success can only be understood properly in terms of the field he was \nmoving in.  \n \nThe struggles surrounding the \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201cexchange rate\u201d of any sort of capital manifest \nthemselves usually as struggles over meaning and interpretation (Zilber 2002). Thus, in our \ncase study, the struggle over whether truth lay in past writings of the Church Fathers or in \npropositions yet to be discovered can be viewed as a struggle over the value of a traditional \neducation as compared to the value of individual intellectual-logical powers. Both are forms \nof cultural capital, but distributed differently over the field. Hence, a shift from the former to \nthe latter can \u2013 and did - cause significant changes in the power distribution.  \n \nSumming up, we can say that that there were two competing logics, the hermetic and the \npublic, in the field. After Abelard\u2019s death, the universitas magistrorum became the focal \nsocial actor for change. They construed their identity around the idea of being \u201cmodernii\u201d or \n\u201cscholastics\u201d and sought to gain power through alliances with non-local forces, viz. the King \nand the Pope. The new public logic was backed by new practices, such as the scholastic \nmethod and the disputatio, as well as new technologies of reading and writing, which in turn \nspawned the emergence of new professions and new social actors. The application of the new \nscholastic method to the core beliefs held in the field took the struggle to a new societal \ndimension that was no longer restricted to education. Finally, Bourdieu\u2019s notion of capital \nhelps us understand what Abelard\u2019s power was based on and how he could move from the \nperiphery to the centre of the field. On a more general plane, it links the symbolic struggles \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 20 \nover meaning and interpretation to the substantive level of resources as we can see how \nshifting interpretations create different exchange values for the different forms of capital. \n \nTHE EMERGENCE OF AN INSTITUTION: POWER AND THE FIELD \n \nHaving introduced the basic elements of my theoretical conceptualisation \u2013 logics, practices \nand resources \u2013 I now want to take a closer look at some issues neglected by the model of \nMisangyi et al. In line with my three questions outlined at the beginning, will first discuss the \neffects of the emergence of a new logic on the old logic, and then use Bourdieu\u2019s notions of \ncapital and the field to model the power situation, both with regard to the established powers \nand to Abelard\u2019s power. \n \nThe old and the new logic \n \nAs explained above, the founding of the university depended, among other things, on a \nchange of the institutional logics from the hermetic to the public one. This switch, however, \nwas not a linear process. More in-depth analysis shows that the hermetic logic also changed as \na consequence of its struggles with the public logic. A third type emerged, which I will call \n\u201cmystic logic\u201d. As we have seen, the hermetic logic viewed knowledge as a treasure to be \nguarded and truth as something revealed through the study of existing books. Accordingly, \nexegesis was the main ingredient of teaching. The role of the teacher was not yet clearly \ndifferentiated from the role of the monk as in both cases the study of existing texts was the \nprime activity. More importantly for our analysis, however, most of these assumptions were \nimplicit and taken-for-granted. As soon as the new logic gained influence, however, these \nassumptions came under scrutiny and were made explicit. This changed the assumptions and \nhence the hermetic logic itself. Where before there was room for individual teachers to vary \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 21 \ntheir practices, and different interpretations of the logic went unchecked, it now began to \nmatter what a master\u2019s interpretations and practices were because it placed him in one camp \nor the other. In a not very metaphorical sense, Abelard and Bernard fought their battles as \nchampions of one or the other logic, and the way they refined and modified their positions \nduring the years in response to one another affected the logics they stood for.  \n \nI will give some examples. In the hermetic logic, knowledge recipients were selected by fate \nrather than by any planned process. People entered monasteries for hundreds of reasons, and \nonce there, they would develop an interest in books and teaching, or not. The public logic, in \ncontrast, claimed that knowledge should be available to all, and everybody could earn a \ndoctorate if he fulfilled the formal requirements. In opposition to this opening, Bernard and \nhis followers declared that gaining knowledge was not a matter of passing through man-made \ncurricula, but something God granted through revelation, his criterion being the moral quality \nof a person. As we can see, this position is different from the original, more or less \nunformulated, hermetic position and moves in the opposite direction from the public logic. A \nsimilar process can be shown in the variation of teaching practices. While the hermetic logic \nfollowed tradition again rather unconsciously by focusing on the lectio but also allowing for \nother forms of teaching, the public logic elevated the scholastic method and the disputatio in a \nvery explicit manner. In response to this, the mystic logic not only defended the lectio but \nemphasised meditation as the only true form because here man communicated with God \nrather than with fellow men. Thus Bernard advised: \n \n\u201cYou will find far more in the forests than you will find in books. The wood and stone will \nteach you more than any master.\u201d (Bernard of Clairvaux, quoted in LeGoff 1986) \n \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 22 \nThese examples show that a switch in institutional logics is not a straightforward business, but \ninvolves repeated reformulations in response to the respective other logic. The process might \neven, as in this case, spark a more radical opposite version of the new logic \u2013 a kind of \n\u201cfundamentalist\u201d response. Moreover, it should be noted how the content of the original logic \ninvariably changes once its tenets are no longer taken for granted because there is an \nalternative. All these observations give substance to Maguire and Hardy\u2019s (2009) claim that \ndefensive institutional work is a distinctive activity that comprises far more than simple \nreproduction. In their eyes, it is about countering assertions, countering categorisations and \ncountering calls for regulations, but with Bourdieu I would like to argue that even more can \nbe said about it. Defensive institutional work is also an attempt to change the \u201cexchange rate\u201d \nof different forms of capital in order to enrich the defenders. If we consider the main \nproponents only, Bernard of Clairvaux, right hand man to the King and the Pope, would of \ncourse not be interested in widening the circle of people who could legitimately decide what \nthe truth was and what not. Bernard, not a university master himself, would of course not be \ninterested in investing formal university degrees with the power to elevate the social status of \nscholars. On the other hand, Abelard, as I have shown above, was the man to benefit from all \nthis.  \n \nThe powers that be \n \nI will now discuss the structural aspects of the case employing Bourdieu\u2019s notions of capitals \nand the field. Let me start with the three most important existing institutions: king, pope and \nchurch. \n \nThe kings of France, the Capet dynasty, had followed an expansionist strategy since the \nbeginning of the 12th century, when Paris became the capital of the kingdom. They privileged \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 23 \nthe cities to subdue the lower nobility, fought against the big feudal lords (most prominently \nthe English king), and managed to create a nationalist feeling through the crusades. Between \n1180 and 1223, the crown lands situated around the Ile de France quadrupled. In this \nexpansion, the University of Paris was not just an economic factor but an ideological one as \nwell. A popular saying went that while Italy had the Pope and Germany the Emperor, France \nhad the University of Paris. The statement shows how a nationalist sentiment was combined \nwith the growing regard for learning. The university provided the kings with an \ninternationally recognised institution. \n \nThe popes are perhaps the most important single actors in this power game. As head of the \nChurch, the Pope initially had the same interests as his local representative, the Bishop of \nParis. In the course of events, however, the Pope became just as often an adversary of the \nBishop guarding the university and its members against the locally motivated demands of the \nBishop. The Pope\u2019s interest in the university was threefold. First, he wanted a rationally based \ntheological foundation to persecute heretics and to arbitrate in the developing disputes \nbetween the religious orders. Second, he sought to strengthen the papacy against regional or \nnational interests. Third, he needed trained staff for his offices. The conditions for pursuing \nthese interests were favourable as the papacy gained hegemony in Europe at the end of the \n12th and beginning of the 13th century. Moreover, in the course of time, the popes themselves \nand many of their cardinals studied at Paris. Thus, for example, three later popes were pupils \nof Abelard. \n \nThe Church as an institution, finally, was important in many respects, three of which I shall \ndiscuss here. First, as already mentioned, it was the traditional institution for learning and \neducation. It thus provided the necessary legitimacy to the new organization. Second, it was \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 24 \nthe major financing body. As masters were clerics, they were mostly paid from benefices2. \nThe most important decision in that respect was to free them from the parochial obligations \nthese benefices brought with them, thus enabling them to devote their time to study and \nteaching and move to different locations. Students would get a prebend to support them \nduring their studies. In addition, Pope Alexander confirmed in 1179 that university teaching \nwas free because learning was a gift from God and teaching a central task (officium) of \nclerics. This helped the students, and brought the masters even closer under Church control \nbecause it made them depend on their benefices. Third, the Church was the only supranational \nEuropean power. Thus the Pope was the only person to be able to grant (and warrant) the \nlicentia ubique docendi, i.e. the right to teach at every university in Europe once a doctoral \ndegree had been awarded. The licentia \u2013 and thus the right to grant it \u2013 was important because \nit signalled a high quality of education and enabled scholars to find employment all over \nEurope. It quickly became the privilege that distinguished universities from other schools and \nlearned foundations.  \n \nIn this power field, the emergent university, or more precisely the universitas magistrorum, \ndid not command many power bases apart from forming coalitions with the people mentioned \nabove. As we have seen, all of these were interested in the university itself or the services it \nprovided. Cultural capital of the form the university offered became more and more in \ndemand. The most important weapon of the new body was the threat to quit the game, in other \nwords, to go on strike or close down completely. This happened when the university closed \nbetween 1229 and 1231.  The second power base was the growing social prestige attributed to \nthe doctoral degree, which made it progressively easier for masters to hold their own against \n                                                 \n2 Apart from this most common arrangement, masters could also be paid by students or by worldly powers. If \nthey were paid in this way, however, they could incur the charge of simony because they asked money for a \nservice that was stipulated to be free. \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 25 \nexternal authorities. As soon as it became clear that the degree promoted social mobility, \nstudents started to pursue it as an end in its own. \n \nAbelard\u2019s power struggles \n \nAuthors discussing institutional logics (for example, Rao and Giorgi 2006; Thornton and \nOcasio 2008) are quite clear on the fact that no matter how \u201cripe\u201d for change a situation is, \nchange will not happen automatically, but always needs one or more agents to bring it about. \nDissatisfaction with the status quo is not enough to abolish established logics and practices, \nbut actors must actively reinterpret logics or introduce new practices. Inducing change in this \nsense presupposes power. There is an ongoing discussion in institutionalist sociology of \nwhether change agents should be located in the centre of the field because this is where the \npower lies (for example, Greenwood and Suddaby 2006), or at the periphery (for example, \nFligstein 2001; Misangyi, Weaver, and Elms 2008) because this is where dissatisfaction with \nthe status quo manifests itself most easily. I believe these antitheses can be integrated in a \nBourdieuan scheme, in which the field is a dynamic situation and \u201cforces are only manifested \nin their relationship with certain dispositions\u201d (Bourdieu 1984, :94). In the following, I will \nshow how Abelard, as the pivotal individual agent, moved from the periphery of the field to \nits centre by accumulating the sort of capital that suddenly rose in value. I can also show how \nAbelard\u2019s fortunes reversed once he moved into a field where the same capital did not count \nfor much. \n \nTo start with, Abelard as a person must have been quite remarkable. In a time when it was \ntaken for granted that the firstborn follows the occupational footsteps of the father, he, \nalthough the eldest son of a knight, decided against a military career to pursue his studies of \nphilosophy. In a time when the individual was more a theoretical construct than a social \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 26 \nreality, he wrote an autobiography. In a time when the Church was based on absolute spiritual \nand worldly power for its magnates and authorities, the young student cleric criticised and \nchallenged his masters publicly \u2013 and successfully. His intellectual brilliance was undisputed \neven among his adversaries. He drew the crowds to Paris or wherever he happened to teach by \nhis reputation in learning and the new methods he used, but also by his eloquence and quick \nwit. He never shunned an intellectual dispute, no matter what the consequences for his \npersonal well-being and security were.  \n \nAgency, however, is not just about individual skills, and thus it is necessary to take a look at \nAbelard\u2019s social ties and power base in order to get an idea of the resources he could \nmobilise. He started his student life as a member of the Goliards. The Goliards were \nwandering students and clerics renowned for their songs and poetry celebrating drinking and \ndebauchery, but even more for their rioting and gambling. Their whole raison d\u2019\u00eatre seems to \nhave been a permanent attack on the establishment, although we cannot be sure how much of \nthis was of a political as opposed to a purely literary nature. Probably this was the audience \nthat the young Abelard took to his disputes with the masters. While he could thus score on the \ninformal side of education, his masters retaliated unfailingly on the formal side, and he was \nexcluded from further study or teaching. These exclusions, however, were local, while his \nfame spread through France and Europe. On his return from Laon to Paris, he had acquired \ncelebrity status. The masses worshipped him, the King invited him to court, and the chapter of \nNotre-Dame made him a master. He had it all: social, economic and cultural capital \u2013 till the \nscandal about Heloise broke.  \n \nThe fateful consequence of his fall from grace and his castration was less that Abelard left \nParis and retired into a monastery \u2013 he would return eventually, both to Paris and to teaching. \nBut following an inner catharsis \u2013 he took the castration to be a sign of God -, Abelard \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 27 \ndecided to write theological treatises. Now, at the time, writing a new book \u2013 whatever its \ncontent \u2013 was a clear signal that someone adhered to the new logic. 50 years before, Anselm \nof Canterbury still had to apologise for writing a new book when everything important was \nalready laid down in the Bible and the writings of the Church Fathers (Flasch 1987). Even \nworse:  \n \n\u201c\u2026I devoted myself to analysing the basis of our faith through illustrations based on \nhuman understanding, and I wrote for my students a certain tract on the unity and trinity of \nGod. This I did because they were always seeking for rational and philosophical \nexplanations, asking rather for reasons they could understand than for mere words, saying \nthat it was futile to utter words which the intellect could not possibly follow, that nothing \ncould be believed unless it could first be understood, and that it was absurd for anyone to \npreach to others a thing which neither he himself nor those whom he sought to teach could \ncomprehend.\u201d (Abelard 1972). \n \nThe books provided his enemies with a crystallization point, a document to be taken to a \nsynod, to be sent to the Pope. As in all similar cases in the Middle Ages, the Church was far \nmore concerned about written documents containing heresy than about oral teaching \n(Courtenay 1989). Moreover, the conflict was no longer about jokes and ribald songs nor \nabout the scholastic method and disputationes, but about one of the core beliefs of the \nCatholic Church: the nature of the Trinity. Abelard was accused of heresy. \n \nIn this sphere of the Church, his capital did not count for much. Abelard had few friends in \nthe Church hierarchy and, worse, a man against him that was the most powerful cleric of the \ntime: Saint Bernhard of Clairvaux. Bernhard was a reformer too, but a reformer who wanted \nto purify the Church and restore the old monastic ideals. He presided over the European-wide \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 28 \nspread of his order, the Cistercians. He was the right hand of the Pope. He was a devoted \nmystic and enraged by the thought that the most divine issues should be \u201cdiscussed on street \ncorners\u201d. He disliked the cities and he disliked intellectual disputes. His strategy for dealing \nwith Jews, pagans and heretics was crusade, inquisition and death. While Abelard was lucky \nto escape physical harm, his books were subsequently condemned and burnt by two synods.  \n \nThe monastery he withdrew to was not exactly Abelard\u2019s home turf either. The monks did not \nwant fame and they did not want intellectual dispute. They absolutely detested the groups of \nstudents hanging around waiting for their idol. And most of all, they detested Abelard telling \nthem that they were stupid, uncivilised and uncouth. Eventually, Abelard was granted \npermission to leave the monastery again. The pattern of his final years was erratic with one \nconstant source of persecution \u2013 Bernhard -, one constant source of support \u2013 his students -, \nbut various and changing magnates with enough power to protect Abelard from Bernhard.  \n \nIn sum, we can see how the logic championed by Abelard was anchored in the students and \ntheir anti-establishment feelings. To them, \u201cnew\u201d was a positive and promising word. To \nthem, reason was about the only possession they had. The man Abelard then brought his \npersonal qualities, above all his intellectual brilliance and boundless self-confidence, to take \nthe fight to the schools, to challenge and best the old order. The more powerful he became as \nan individual, the more his thoughts mattered, and when his fortunes reversed, his opponents \nstruck. However, although they destroyed the man, the logics he stood for were too widely \ndisseminated to fade away with him. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 29 \nWhat, then, can we take from the case of the University of Paris for the study of modern \ninstitutions? Let me return to the three questions I asked at the beginning. With regard to the \nconnexion between the symbolic levels of the old and the new logic, I have shown how the \nold logic changes in communication with the new one, even up to the point where it develops \na third, \u201canti-new\u201d logic. The driving factor in this process is the degree of explicitness of \nassumptions on which the logics are based. While the old logic tends to comprise many \nimplicit and rather vague notions that are open to various interpretations, the new and \u201canti-\nnew\u201d logics tend to be more explicit, precise and extreme in their propositions. This finding \nadds substance to the comparatively recent interest in defensive institutional work raised by \nMaguire and Hardy (2009) in showing that this kind of institutional work is far more than a \nmere defence of the status quo but involves active strategies of shifting logics and \naccumulating various forms of capital. My analysis, however, departs from theirs when it \ncomes to the question of the defended logic itself. While they argue that \u201cpractices tend to be \nreproduced when the discourse about them is \u2018structured\u2019[\u2026] and \u2018coherent\u2019\u201d (Maguire and \nHardy 2009, :150), I would like to stress that the work invested into this discourse changes the \ndefended logic itself in the ways I have discussed above. \n \nThe second question referred to the structural context of the relevant social actors. As I have \nshown in the two preceding sections, much can be gained from conceptualising social actors \nwith Bourdieu as occupying power positions in a field. These positions are defined by the \nactors\u2019 different forms of capital and constrain and enable their strategic conduct. This \nconceptualisation gives a more precise idea of how actors are embedded in, and interact with, \ninstitutions. Thus, the case study has shown how Abelard\u2019s social and cultural capital \nincreased in value due to changes in the cultural context (positive valuation of disillusion, \nscepticism, attack on establishment) and how he then used this capital to move to the centre of \nthe field of education. This observation serves to build a case for the tenet referred to above \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 30 \nthat only actors at the centre of a field can change this field. The case study has also shown \nhow, in the second part of his career, Abelard was forced to act in environments (monastery, \nChurch hierarchy) where his capital did not count for much and thus never regained the force \nhe commanded in the first part of his career. With regard to the universitas magistrorum and \nthe later university, I have been able to show how they could increase the value of their \ncultural capital by serving the interests of the King and Pope up to the point where they \nbecame an independent player in the power game, i.e. an institution with autonomous internal \nlegislation and control. In all these examples, the social actors are construed and legitimated \nby the field, but also display a certain amount of independency and strategic action. \nEspecially in the case of Abelard, while there are structural constraints, there is no structural \ndeterminism in his actions. This may serve as an illustration of my initial argument that it is \npossible to construe actors as embedded in a field without relinquishing reflexivity and \ninnovative action. \n \nThe third question, finally, touched upon the question of emergence and the possibility of an \ninstitutional logic without an institution. As we can see from the case of the University of \nParis, the public logic emerged before the organisation itself and before this organisation \ncould then develop institutional features. How, then, did it emerge? Several factors came \ntogether. First, on the cultural plane, we have seen how disillusion and alienation led to a \nsceptical and ironic attitude towards established traditions, identities and institutions. This \nseems to have invited a certain \u201cpostmodern\u201d attitude in which playfulness and fun overrode \nmechanisms of cognitive and social closure \u2013 this is certainly true for the Goliard movement \nin which Abelard took his first steps. While not \u201canything went\u201d \u2013 it never does -, new \nthoughts and practices had a better chance than usual. At the same time, existing elements on \nthe intermediate level, for example the disputatio as a method of teaching, were incorporated \nbut given a new interpretation. In the same way, most importantly, the scholastic method left \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 31 \nits home in philosophy and conquered theology. On the substantive level, new resources in \nthe form of different capital types as well as new technologies fed back into the emerging \nsymbolic and intermediate levels. The guild of the universitas magistrorum can be seen as the \nbracket, or perhaps more precisely the arena, in which these processes came together.  \n \nThis leads me, finally, to the value of studying historical, as opposed to modern, institutions. \nMost of the observations described above are in line with general tenets from neo-\ninstitutionalist authors linking extra-institutional context factors with a shift in institutional \nlogics. Thus, Clemens and Cook (1999) describe on a general plane how institutional change \nis driven by a change in schemas (i.e. cultural components) and resources that are embedded \nin, or enacted through, resources and social networks. DiMaggio (1997) speculates that large-\nscale cultural changes may be caused by many interdependent actors switching from the old \nlogic to the new. Lawrence and Phillips (2004) emphasise the role of a change in macro-\ncultural understandings that can serve as a critical precondition for institutional change. What \nmy findings add to these is a more detailed picture of the sequence of events. The insight that \nthe new logic was established before the institution itself, and how it emerged from a \ncombination of changes in the cultural context, agency and change in practices has up to now \nnot been provided in this detail. I don\u2019t want to claim that this sequence is the only possible \u2013 \nthis is, after all, only one case study. However, as I predicted, the sequence could be identified \nso clearly because it was situated in a field with a low degree of institutionalisation compared \nto modern educational settings. The scholastic method, paper, eyeglasses and copyists were \nvery original \u201cinventions\u201d of a rather revolutionary nature rather than the variations in \nexisting practices modern institutions often build on. This result should encourage \ninstitutionalist scholars to conduct more historical analyses reaching back into pre-modern \ntimes. \n \nThe Emergence of the University \n   \n 32 \nReferences \nAbaelard, Peter. 1987.
