Whilst early analysts broadly agreed with MacCannell\u2019s \nthesis that tourism, by turning culture into a commodity, replaced real with \u2018staged\u2019 \nauthenticity (ibid, 91-107), more recent work has shown \u2018an increased awareness of the social \nconstruction and invention of both tradition and authenticity\u2019 (Wood, 1992: 57). That is, \nauthenticity is increasingly seen as a socially constructed concept, with criteria for judgement \nof \u2018the authentic\u2019 varying greatly between different actors. In addition, analysts are moving \naway from rather naive considerations of the \u2018impact\u2019 of tourism on pristine, pre-tourist \nculture, to an appreciation that not only does tourism create a \u2018space for discussion\u2019 of \ntradition (see both Adams and Picard, this issue), but that its \u2018impact\u2019 is always bound up \nwith local cultural politics (Wood, 1992: 67-8). \n \nIn this paper, I describe an Indonesian tourism project \u2013 the \u2018discovery\u2019 of an apparently \n\u2018untouched\u2019 village and its remodelling into a \u2018tourist site\u2019 \u2013 in which issues of \u2018authenticity\u2019 \nplayed a central part. As I shall show, both concepts of authenticity and perceptions of what \nobjects, practices or other aspects of culture should be the focus of talk about authenticity \nvaried between state officials, ambitious young men, ritual elders and other villagers. Not \nonly does the project I describe have implications for pan-Indonesian discourses on \u2018culture\u2019 \nand \u2018ethnicity\u2019, it also raises issues concerning the ways in which local people distinguish \nbetween different kinds of visitors, and how \u2018tourism\u2019 can have a profound impact on local \nperceptions of place and identity, even in the absence of large numbers of visitors. \n \n \nWa\u00e9 Rebo, a village \u2018in need of preservation\u2019 \n \n 3\nManggarai is the most westerly regency (kabupaten) of the Indonesian island of Flores, with \na linguistically and culturally diverse population of some half a million people. The \npredominant economic activity remains subsistence cultivation of corn, rice and various \ntubers, with an increasing reliance on cash crops such as coffee. However, in the western port \nof Labuanbajo, and to a lesser extent in inland villages and the town of Ruteng, tourism is \nalso opening up new economic opportunities (Erb, 2000). Whilst many tourists continue to \nvisit western Flores in order to see the famous \u2018dragons\u2019 of Komodo and Rinca islands, \nManggarai is also seeing an increase in the promotion of \u2018ethnic\u2019 and \u2018cultural tourism\u2019. \n \nThe community with whom I carried out fieldwork number almost 500 people and are split \nbetween two sites in southern Manggarai: a highland, origin village called Wa\u00e9 Rebo and a \nlowland, satellite village called Kombo. Life for most households involves more or less \nfrequent travelling between these sites, and many villagers describe themselves as \u2018people \nwho swing\u2019 (ata j\u00e9jong)i. Whilst Wa\u00e9 Rebo is an old, ancestral site, Kombo was founded in \n1967, on the orders of state officials, on donated land near to the Catholic church, school and \nnewly-opened wet rice fields. A large number of nearby villages were forced to relocate in \nthe lowlands at this time, following a general pattern of spatial \u2018development\u2019 in eastern \nIndonesia whereby village relocation went hand-in-hand with the destruction of traditional \nhousing (Fox, 1993: 168-9). However, the impact of such development on Wa\u00e9 Rebo was \nrather unusual in two respects. Firstly, the community did not abandon its highland site, and \ntoday the mountain village sits in an isolated position, a four-hour walk through dense forest \nfrom the lowlands. Secondly, and uniquely within Manggarai, the highland village was able \nto retain four mbaru niang \u2013 traditional, \u2018circular houses\u2019. These structures are very different \nfrom the rectangular houses, with a separate kitchen at the back, that predominate in \nManggarai today. Niang houses are round and windowless, with a central hearth and a ridge-\n 4\npole sticking out from a conical, thatched roof sloping down to the floor. Once found \nthroughout the regency, they were pulled down in the name of \u2018hygiene\u2019 and \u2018development\u2019 \nby both Dutch colonial and later Indonesian government officials. \n \nThe existence of traditional, multi-family niang housing, together with the community\u2019s \ncontinual travel between highlands and lowlands, lay behind my own choice of Wa\u00e9 Rebo-\nKombo as an interesting fieldsite for conducting research on place and landscape (Allerton, \n2001). However, I was not the only outsider to have become interested in Wa\u00e9 Rebo at this \ntime. In November 1997, just over a month after I began fieldwork, the village erupted in a \nflurry of activity when it was visited by the Bupati or state head of the Manggarai regency. \nAlerted by previous foreign visitors that Wa\u00e9 Rebo still contained four original niang houses, \nthe Bupati arrived with a large group of over 40 state officials and teachers to see for himself \nwhat he and his staff immediately began to call the most \u2018authentic\u2019 (BI asli) of Manggarai \nvillages. Indeed, the implicit reasoning behind this visit was that if a village had retained \ntraditional housing it must, de facto, have preserved other \u2018traditional\u2019 aspects of Manggarai \nlife. Thus, a local newspaper report on the visit commented: \n\u2018According to Bupati Ehok, one of his reasons for visiting Wae Rebo is that it has \nmany of the customs of Manggarai people which have already changed as a \nconsequence of recent development. \u201cI wish to discover again the authentic \nculture of Manggarai people in Wae Rebo. I don\u2019t want Manggarai people to lose \ntheir authentic culture. It is for that that I am trying to give a warning about \nculture\u201d, states Ehok.\u2019 (Pos Kupang, 3.1.98) \nLike the Chinese \u2018ethnic tourist villages\u2019 described by Oakes (1997), Wa\u00e9 Rebo was viewed \nby the local government as something of a cultural relic that had, through geographical \nisolation, escaped the ravages of recent historyii. However, the irony that the government, \n 5\nwhich had once pulled down niang houses, was now giving a \u2018warning about culture\u2019, was \nnot lost on villagers. \n \nBeneath the lofty aims to rediscover \u2018symbolic values which have begun to disappear in \nManggarai\u2019 (Pos Kupang, 3.1.98), one highly significant purpose of the Bupati\u2019s visit was the \ndesire to develop Wa\u00e9 Rebo as a tempat parawisata or \u2018tourism site\u2019. The Pos Kupang report \nsuggests that Wa\u00e9 Rebo, approached by a four-hour walk through rainforest, is just right for \n\u2018hiking\u2019 or \u2018adventure\u2019 (sic). Indeed, despite its official status as a formal government \nreception, the Bupati\u2019s visit could itself be seen as a form of domestic tourism, particularly \nfor those officials from other areas of Flores. However, whilst the village was officially \nregarded as \u2018authentic\u2019 and \u2018in need of preservation\u2019, a number of enhancements were \nnevertheless required before the site could be promoted as a fully pristine tourist attraction. \nThus, some three weeks after the Bupati\u2019s visit, news reached the village of his plans to \nsponsor the rebuilding of the community\u2019s \u2018drum house\u2019 (mbaru gendang) \u2013 at that time a \nrectangular building raised up on stones \u2013 as a large, planted, niang house. A sixth niang was \nalso to be built in place of a large house in the village yard, the shiny, metal roof of which \nwas thought to produce an unattractive gleam in photographs of this cultural curio. The \nremodelling of Wa\u00e9 Rebo thus had what Urry (1990) calls the \u2018tourist gaze\u2019 \u2013 in particular as \nfiltered through the lens of a camera \u2013 very much in mind. \n \nThe Bupati\u2019s project to remove two \u2018unsightly\u2019 houses and replace them with niang, shows \nthe significance of architecture as a key marker of authenticity to the state. However, as with \nthe \u2018troglodyte houses\u2019 of the Turkish \u2018tourist village\u2019 described by Tucker (1997: 118), the \nmeaning of niang houses for some villagers concerned the practicalities of life, rather than \ntheir status as \u2018monuments\u2019 of authenticity. Those living in old niang complained that they \n 6\nwere rather cramped and smoky, whilst others objected to what they saw as the wasteful \ndismantling of the pre-existing, rectangular drum house. In addition, although most people \nwere pleased that the Bupati was funding the rebuilding project, and were flattered by his \nstress on the uniqueness of their village, the rebuilding did generate certain tensions within \nthe community. Local officials wanted the project finished before the Bupati left office in \nSpring 1999, but many villagers felt that the work \u2013 including the felling and transporting of \ntimber \u2013 was rushed through far too quickly. There were also a number of tensions between \nyoung men, particularly those with more schooling than average, and the community\u2019s elders. \nThe frequently argumentative stance of the former exasperated the latter, who felt that harsh \nwords at the time of building a community drum house created an atmosphere of spiritual \ndanger. One young man, who I shall call \u2018Marsel\u2019, was chosen to represent the village at \nmeetings with the Bupati\u2019s staff in Ruteng, his fluency in Indonesian considered crucial for \nnegotiations with the government. However, his frequent use of complicated Indonesian was \nnot seen as appropriate for village-based meetings with (non-fluent) elders, for whom the \nrebuilding of a drum house concerned rather more than architecture. \n \n \nThe drum house: one body, one voice \n \nIn order to understand the wider impact of the Bupati\u2019s rebuilding project \u2013 begun in earnest \nin August 1998 and completed with a large communal ritual in July 1999 \u2013 it is important to \ndescribed in more detail the significance of a Manggarai \u2018drum house\u2019. Despite changes in \nbuilt style, drum houses (taking their name from the heirloom drums hanging in the centre of \nthe house) continue to be the most prominent building in a Manggarai village or village-\nquarter \u2013 a place for holding meetings, rituals and Sunday-morning prayers. It is in part \n 7\nbecause of the features of a drum house that Manggarai can be seen as a society where, as \nelsewhere in southeast Asia, \u2018Houses\u2019 are both prominent social institutions and \u2018ordered \nstructures\u2019 expressing key cultural values (L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1987: 156; Errington, 1989: 236-\n241). Indeed, it is the indigenous significance of houses that makes the Bupati\u2019s choice of \ncultural project so intriguing. \n \nThere are five main socio-symbolic aspects of a Manggarai drum house \u2013 primarily related to \nkinship and ritual authority \u2013 that shall be briefly outlined here. Firstly, a drum house is a \ncommunal building for a clan or clan branch, symbolising the ideal unity of patrilineal \ndescent. A clan dwells as one body in a drum house, the drums frequently described as its \n\u2018voice\u2019 (r\u00e9wo). However, in reality, and like other southeast Asian \u2018houses\u2019, the drum house \ncan encompass those members of a community related not through descent but by ties of \nmarriage alliance (cf. Errrington, 1989: 238). Indeed, the second main socio-symbolic aspect \nof a drum house also connects with certain of L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019s comments concerning the \nprojection of a tension between descent and alliance in such \u2018Houses\u2019 (1987: 155). During the \nconstruction process, the central ridge-pole (ngando) of a Manggarai drum house is \nconceived of as a young, kidnapped bride. Thus, a drum house, the symbol of the patrilineal \nkinship uniting a community, actually has at its heart an outsider, a \u2018mountain bride\u2019 (molas \nposo). \n \nThirdly, the drum house\u2019s role in an ideology of clan unity is also complicated by its function \nin the growth of village communities. Throughout Manggarai, people make distinctions \nbetween old, origin villages and those settled by people who \u2018went to find corn and rice\u2019 or \nnew land. Crucially, a new village is thought to remain ritually dependent on its origin site \nuntil it is able to \u2018make a village\u2019 (pand\u00e9 b\u00e9o) by building its own drum house. Drum houses \n 8\nnot only mark community independence, they also reflect the history of the movements of \ndifferent clans from origin villages to new sites. Thus, although Wa\u00e9 Rebo-Kombo is a \u2018one \nclan\u2019 village, other multi-clan villages may have more than one drum house, or one building \nuniting a number of different clans. \n \nFourthly, and connected with such historical movements, a Manggarai drum house is \nimplicated in and symbolises structures of traditional authority. A community centred on \nsuch a house has two traditional positions of authority: the \u2018head of the hill\/ village\u2019 (tu\u2019a \ngolo), responsible for the resolution of land disputes and other \u2018political\u2019 matters, and the \n\u2018head of the drums\u2019 (tu\u2019a gendang), responsible for ritual matters. The drums are associated, \nboth symbolically and physically, with the \u2018right to speak\u2019, and may not be removed from a \ndrum house. Moreover, in multi-clan villages, only a member of the clan claiming precedence \n(whether in time or space) can be ritual leader or \u2018hold the drums\u2019. Finally, a drum house is \nalso a home for ancestral spirits and, as such, is a focus for community fertility and renewal. \nThis aspect is revealed most strongly during penti, a series of \u2018new year\u2019 rituals \u2013 many \ncentred on the drum house \u2013 at which requests are made for the ongoing \u2018growth\u2019 (beka) of \nthe community and its fields. \n \nWhat this brief description shows is that the significance of a Manggarai drum house, as both \na building and a complex set of ideas, is largely unrelated to the style of its architecture. \nMoreover, since \u2018the House\u2019 is a central institution in Manggarai, the Bupati\u2019s rebuilding \nproject raises pertinent issues concerning the impact of social change on \u2018house-based\u2019 \nsocieties (cf. L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1983: 187). For example, the local government\u2019s vision of a drum \nhouse as a predominantly \u2018cultural\u2019 and \u2018artistic\u2019 artefact is at variance with its local role in \n 9\nkinship and social organisation. What, then, is the political significance of the local \ngovernment\u2019s interest in \u2018Houses\u2019, and in \u2018culture\u2019 more generally? \n \n \nState and culture: remodelling an \u2018authentic\u2019 village \n \nThe remodelling of Wa\u00e9 Rebo\u2019s drum house was not the first project in Manggarai to rebuild \ntraditional housing. A few years earlier, the drum house of Todo, a village whose leaders had \nbeen appointed to the position of raja (\u2018king\u2019) by a succession of outside powers, was rebuilt \nas a large mbaru niang (Erb, 1998). The Todo project had been instigated and funded by \nwesterners, notably the Polish parish priest and a Swiss development agency involved in road \nconstruction throughout Manggarai. However, by contrast with Todo, the rebuilding of the \nWa\u00e9 Rebo drum house not only took place against the backdrop of four pre-existing niang \nhouses, but was entirely funded (to the sum of 30 million Rupiah) by the Manggarai \ngovernment. The fact that this occurred during a time of acute economic and political \ninstability in Indonesia should be proof enough of how seriously the state takes its \u2018cultural\u2019 \nprojects. Moreover, although the building of the Wa\u00e9 Rebo drum house was completed after \nthe fall of Suharto\u2019s government it was, with its appeals to \u2018traditional values\u2019, a classic \u2018New \nOrder\u2019 cultural project (Hitchcock, 1998: 127). \n \nAcciaioli has described how the value of Indonesian adat \u2013 \u2018custom\u2019 or \u2018tradition\u2019 \u2013 has \nbecome primarily aesthetic and is, for members of \u2018isolated tribes\u2019, increasingly prescribed \nby local Indonesian officials (1985: 152-3). During the rebuilding of the Wa\u00e9 Rebo drum \nhouse, Marsel, the young man with responsibility to the local government, was keen to see all \nmale elders \u2013 who normally wear their own sweatshirts for rituals \u2013 in a kind of adat \n 10\n\u2018uniform\u2019, including pristine white shirts to set off the colours of woven sarongs and scarfs. \nInterestingly, this prescriptive approach to \u2018tradition\u2019 went hand-in-hand with attempts to \nplay down local diversity. One evening during the rebuilding process, people collected \ntogether in one of the older niang houses to sing drumming songs. When visitors from \nanother village suggested that their own songs were rather different to those of Wa\u00e9 Rebo, \nMarsel became agitated, insisting that people \u2018must not talk about differences\u2019, since \nManggarai culture was \u2018all the same\u2019. As with the case of clothing, this shows an official \nview of \u2018authentic\u2019 culture as regionally uniform. \n \nOne key catchphrase of Suharto\u2019s New Order was \u2018the preservation of national culture\u2019 (BI \nkelestarian kebudayaan nasional). However, what the government chose to preserve \u2013 \nhouses, ritual costumes, handicrafts and other marketable \u2018objects\u2019 \u2013 was only a small part of \nwhat anthropologists would term \u2018culture\u2019 (Kipp, 1993: 111-113; Picard, 1997: 197). In \nparticular, rumah adat or \u2018customary\/ traditional houses\u2019 have enormous importance in state-\nsponsored representations of Indonesia, appearing in school atlases, maps in provincial \noffices and tourist brochures (cf. Adams, 1984: 476). Within Manggarai, pictures of \ntraditional niang houses appear, in rationalized form, on the shoulder patches of local \nofficials and teachers. Most explicitly, at Jakarta\u2019s \u2018Taman Mini\u2019 theme-park, twenty-six \nrumah adat representing the \u2018genuine customary architectural style\u2019 of Indonesia\u2019s twenty-six \nprovinces present an ahistorical image of Indonesia\u2019s \u2018Unity in Diversity\u2019 (Pemberton, 1994: \n152).  \n \nThe project to remodel Wa\u00e9 Rebo as a tourist site showed the changing significance of such \nrumah adat. Although the Indonesian word adat generally signifies \u2018customs\u2019, when used as \nan adjective it increasingly implies what is \u2018traditional\u2019 in the sense of no-longer-regularly-\n 11\nused but necessary to \u2018preserve\u2019 as a mark of \u2018cultural identity\u2019. As the focus for kinship and \nritual that I have outlined above, the old, rectangular drum house in Wa\u00e9 Rebo was a \n\u2018customary\u2019 adat centre. However, in architectural or aesthetic terms it was not \u2018traditional\u2019. \nThe Bupati\u2019s rebuilding project was thus an attempt to make sure that the drum house became \nan Indonesian rumah adat in the full sense of the term. In the process, though, the \nsignificance of the house as an institution was overshadowed, and emphasis was primarily \ngiven to niang architecture as a marker of Manggarai ethnicity. One man in Wa\u00e9 Rebo, who \nwas noted for his rather grand pronouncements in Indonesian, said that it was important to \nbuild the house well because niang houses were the \u2018heirlooms of Manggarai culture\u2019 \n(pusaka kebudayaan Manggarai). \n \nHutajulu has argued that the Toba Batak tradition, reworked for tourists, serves to situate the \nToba Batak \u2018as a \u201clegitimate\u201d ethnic group within the framework of Indonesian nationalism\u2019 \n(1995: 639). This is an extremely important point with regard to the political significance of \nhouse-building, and echoes Wood\u2019s arguments that \u2018touristic space can offer an opportunity \nfor asserting local identities and rights against other groups\u2019 (1992: 59-60). Manggarai as a \nregion has long been lacking in the necessary cultural \u2018objects\u2019 to entice tourists off their \nbuses as they travel from Komodo, with its famous dragons, to the regency of Ngada, the old \nvillage sites and traditional housing of which are a regular feature in guide-books on eastern \nIndonesia. With the rebuilding of traditional housing in Manggarai, together with staged \n\u2018performances\u2019 of sasi whip-fighting, \u2018the Manggarai\u2019 have more claim to being considered a \nlegitimate ethnic group within the \u2018diversity\u2019 of the nation. Indeed, the perception of niang \nhousing as an aesthetic marker of Manggarai ethnicity is also seen in attempts by the Catholic \nchurch to \u2018inculturate\u2019 churches as places by creating links with more traditional structures \n(cf. Barnes, 1992: 171). One such building is the chapel in Borik, a large village on the south \n 12\ncoast. This chapel, another of the projects instigated by the priest behind the rebuilding of the \nTodo drum house, has been built in a circular, niang-type style, with a large mural depicting \nJesus and the disciples in Manggarai dress. However, its most striking feature clearly evokes \nthe image of a drum house: a central post from which hang drums and a gong. \n \nThese state and church views of niang architecture and drum houses as cultural artefacts may \nbe having a gradual impact on local perceptions of a drum house as a rather complex social \ninstitution. During the rebuilding process in Wa\u00e9 Rebo, I was aware of some concern \namongst villagers that their drum house might be \u2018taken over\u2019 as a place for simply receiving \nvisitors. One young man involved in liasing with state officials had been heard to say that it \nmight be better for no-one to live in the drum house, so that the interior would not become \nsoot-blackened. Over the next few days, villagers told me that this was ridiculous, since the \nsmoke from the hearth was needed to preserve both stored foodstuffs and the roof thatch. \nNevertheless, the seeds of a suspicion had been sown, and towards the end of the rebuilding, I \nheard a number of older villagers referring to the house not as the mbaru gendang, but the \nmbaru de Bupati or \u2018Bupati\u2019s house\u2019. Indeed, a perception of the new drum house as in some \nway the property of the Bupati also received support from people\u2019s awareness of the sums of \nmoney arriving from Ruteng, as well as the system for the organisation of timber-felling, \nwhich fined men who missed a scheduled day of communal work. Not only did the \nintroduction of these fines, and of work payments, grate with individual men, but the system \nwas contrary to the traditional notion of a communal drum house being built with (voluntary) \ncommunal labour (dodo). When I returned to Wa\u00e9 Rebo in April 2001, I saw an even starker \nreminder of the Bupati\u2019s \u2018ownership\u2019 of the drum house \u2013 a small plaque erected above the \ndoor of the new niang, and bearing the inscription \u2018made official by the Bupati of Manggarai, \nDr G.P. Ehok, Ruteng, 13 July 1999\u2019.  \n 13\n \n \nExpanding authenticity: Wa\u00e9 Rebo as a tourist site \n \nHow has the rebuilding project and the transformation of Wa\u00e9 Rebo into a \u2018tourist site\u2019 \naffected the local community? In the first place, it is worth noting how, throughout the local \narea, the Bupati\u2019s visit has become emblematically linked with what some now call \u2018the \ncultural village of Wa\u00e9 Rebo\u2019 (kampung budaya Wa\u00e9 Rebo). I became particularly aware of \nthis during recent fieldwork with children, when I used photographs as prompts for \ndiscussion. When initially shown photographs of various different events and rituals in Wa\u00e9 \nRebo, almost all the children in a range of age-groups declared them to be pictures of \u2018the \ntime of the Bupati\u2019s visit\u2019 (laing said Bupati). Moreover, although there have been no visits \nto the village by government officials since the ritual held to \u2018open\u2019 the drum house, and \nalthough Bupati Ehok has since been replaced, villagers nevertheless believe that the Bupati\u2019s \noffice is committed to the long-term development of Wa\u00e9 Rebo. Many think the Bupati will \nsponsor the rebuilding of one of the old niang houses, which collapsed during storms in \nJanuary 2001. Some retain the hope that a road can be built to the village, to ease the \ntransportation of the annual coffee crop, although others appreciate that this may reduce the \nopportunities offered to tourists for \u2018hiking\u2019.  \n \nRobert Wood has argued that the very presence of tourists may be interpreted by local people \nas a sign of cultural authenticity (1997: 2). The interest of both tourists and government \nofficials in Wa\u00e9 Rebo has strengthened villagers\u2019 sense of themselves as possessors of \nauthentic Manggarai adat, and has even led to a re-valuing of woven baskets and sarongs as \n\u2018culture\u2019. At the local level, villagers have also seized on the language of \u2018authenticity\u2019 and \n 14\n\u2018preservation\u2019 as a way of stressing their historical and political importance (cf. Wood, 1992: \n67-8). Earlier, I noted that a project to rebuild a niang house had been organised by various \noutsiders in the \u2018royal\u2019 village of Todo. Significantly, Wa\u00e9 Rebo people consider themselves \nto be in the position of \u2018elder sibling\u2019 (ka\u2019\u00e9) to Todo, their foundation myth asserting Wa\u00e9 \nRebo\u2019s original right, over those in Todo, to be \u2018kings\u2019 of Manggarai. Villagers therefore \ninterpret the involvement of the Bupati in their own rebuilding project, as well as their \npreservation of \u2018authentic\u2019 niang architecture, as evidence of their own cultural and political \nsuperiority to Todo. This politically-motivated discourse on \u2018authenticity\u2019 has also been \nextended to new areas, the most notable being language. Within the regency, a number of \ndifferent dialects of Bahasa Manggarai are spoken, and language differences are a subject of \ngreat fascination to most people. Whilst Ruteng, Todo and villages to the east of Wa\u00e9 Rebo \nfollow the central Manggarai dialect, Wa\u00e9 Rebo and villages in the mountains to the west \nfollow the dialect identified as the \u2018s\/h shift\u2019. What is significant in the context of the \npromotion of Wa\u00e9 Rebo as the authentic Manggarai village is that both villagers and \ngovernment officials have (quite erroneously) begun to speak of the Wa\u00e9 Rebo dialect as the \nmost \u2018authentic\u2019 (asli) Manggarai language, and one which other areas have \u2018forgotten\u2019. \nThus, villagers would stress that I had chosen to live in the village because I needed to learn \n\u2018the authentic Wa\u00e9 Rebo Manggarai language\u2019 (bahasa Manggarai asli Wa\u00e9 Rebo), rather \nthan the corrupted dialect of the town. \n \nThe impact of Wa\u00e9 Rebo\u2019s transformation is particularly interesting given the extremely \nsmall numbers of tourists who have actually visited the village. After the Bupati\u2019s visit, \ninterest was generated mainly at the local level, with a party of Ruteng tourism students \narriving on an excursion (piknik) to visit the village. Later, between March 1999 and my \nreturn trip in April 2001, Wa\u00e9 Rebo was visited by a number of Indonesians and by nine \n 15\nforeign tourists, who all dutifully wrote their names and addresses in the village\u2019s new \u2018guest \nbook\u2019. These very small numbers of actual visitors mean that \u2018tourism\u2019 is not yet viewed by \nvillagers as a source of economic opportunity. Rather, and in addition to the various \ndiscourses on authenticity and culture that I have outlined, these visits have generated a \nnumber of different types of stories in the village. The first of these, primarily directed at \nforeign tourists, focuses on moral evaluations of the tourist\u2019s behaviour, demeanour and \ndress. A crucial concern for villagers is whether or not the visitor could speak any \nIndonesian. Indeed, the ability to converse with villagers often leads people to distinguish the \nvisitor as a \u2018school person\u2019 (ata sekolah), who has come to \u2018study\u2019 the village, as opposed to \nthose identified as, in an interesting turn of phrase, \u2018authentic tourists\u2019 (turis asli). \n \nThe second genre of tourist stories focuses on what the tourists had taken photographs of \u2013 \nwhether the exterior or interior of houses, whether women weaving or people working in \ntheir fields. Indeed, many villagers, who have themselves never held a camera, are now able \nto advise on the best places to photograph the village centre or particular houses. However, as \nTucker has argued, focusing too much on the tourist \u2018gaze\u2019 can gloss over what actually takes \nplace in touristic processes (1997: 107). Although this \u2018gaze\u2019 was crucial to the remodelling \nof Wa\u00e9 Rebo, photographs sent after a visit are also one of the key elements in the individual \nexchange relationships established with some visitors. Indeed, the third kind of \u2018tourist \nstories\u2019 focus on these individual relationships, and on the gifts and hospitality offered to \ntourists, who are viewed as a rather special category of guest (cf. Erb, 2000). Talk about food \nand eating is something of a Manggarai obsession, and to feed someone is to gradually \nincorporate them into one\u2019s house and family (cf. Wolff, this issue). Thus, people take great \npride in recalling the types of food they offered to visitors, and were extremely offended \nwhen some visitors from Ruteng turned up in the village with food of their own. Indeed, \n 16\nwhilst the local government might see architecture as the most significant aspect of culture, \nvillagers are likely to see traditions of hospitality to visitors as crucial evidence of their \nuncorrupted authenticity. \n \nWhilst early tourism studies focused on tourists\u2019 search for an authenticity that they found \nwanting in their own lives and cultures, this article has considered a \u2018tourist site\u2019 which has \nyet to receive many visitors, but which is nevertheless fully engaged with discourses on \nauthenticity and tradition. After rejoicing in its \u2018discovery\u2019 of such an \u2018untouched\u2019 village as \nWa\u00e9 Rebo, the Manggarai government soon set about remodelling the village into a paradigm \nof New Order \u2018culture\u2019. In the process, the significance of a drum house as a social institution \nand ancestral home was downplayed in favour of its role as a cultural object and marker of \nethnicity. However, despite the cultural politics involved in this process, this article has also \nshown how Wa\u00e9 Rebo-Kombo people responded creatively to the stress on the unique nature \nof their village. In their ongoing negotiation with various outsiders, they have thereby \nsignified as \u2018authentic\u2019 a number of phenomena \u2013 from language to hospitality, and even to \ntourists themselves \u2013 that state discourse ignores. \n 17\nNotes \n \nI am indebted to the residents of Wa\u00e9 Rebo-Kombo, who have generously welcomed me into their \nhomes and lives, and who took pains to involve me in all aspects of the rebuilding project described \nhere. Fieldwork in Manggarai was carried out between September 1997 and March 1999, under the \nsponsorship of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) and Universitas Nusa Cendana, Kupang. \nFinancial support came from an ESRC Research Studentship. Two subsequent trips to Manggarai, \nbetween March and August 2001, have been undertaken whilst a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson \nCollege, Oxford, with fieldwork funding from the British Academy's Fund for Southeast Asian \nStudies. \n                                                          \ni The main language of the village, and the language in which fieldwork was conducted, is the \u2018s-h dialect\u2019 of \nBahasa Manggarai (BM). Only a minority of villagers are fluent in the national language, Bahasa Indonesia \n(BI), which is learnt at primary school and used in all \u2018official\u2019 dealings. Unless otherwise indicated, words and \nphrases used in this article are in BM. \nii Of course, this is far from the case, and it is worth emphasising that Wa\u00e9 Rebo has been as much affected by \n\u2018history\u2019 and by spatial transformations as the villages laid out neatly along roads in the lowlands (see Allerton, \n2001). \n \n \nReferences \n \nAcciaioli, G. 1985.
