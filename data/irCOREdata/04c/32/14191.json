Flexibility is a concept that can be operationalized in many ways. One approach to concep-\ntualizing flexibility within courses is to distinguish planning-type flexibility, which the instructor can\ndesignate before the course begins and which needs to be managed when the course is offered, for\ninterpersonal flexibility, which relates more to the dynamics of the course as it is experienced by the\nlearners. Course management systems (CMSs) offer options that can support both of these sorts of\nflexibility, if instructors use the CMSs with a systematic frame of reference. The instructor faces\nchallenges in managing both types of flexibility, but the experience at one institution shows that\nbeing systematic about flexibility choices and ways to support those choices in the institutional CMS\ncan help in meeting these challenges.\nIntroduction: flexibility in higher education\nTraditional universities are in the process of providing quality education for rapidly\ndiversifying student cohorts (Observatory of Borderless Education, 2002; Middle-\nhurst, 2003). This change process is multi-faceted including a broader range of\nstudents, changing roles of instructors, more-flexible curricula, new delivery methods,\nnew contacts between universities and other partners, and the globalization of higher\neducation (Guri-Rosenblit, 1998). Bates (2001) argues that increasingly flexible\nlearning is necessary in this changing situation. This is not a new orientation: Van den\nBrande, in the foreword of a comprehensive book on open and flexible learning, indi-\ncated that \u2018there must be more flexibility to meet the needs of the learner, through\nadaptability to different learner needs, learning patterns and settings, and media\ncombinations\u2019 (1993, p. xxi). Flexibility can occur within the individual course, as a\n*Corresponding author. Faculty of Behavioural Sciences, University of Twente. P.O. box 217,\n7500 AE Enschede, The Netherlands.

Flexibility can involve options in course\nresources, in types of learning activities, in media to support learning, in options for\ncommunication and social interaction, and many other possibilities (Ling et al., 2001;\nZimitat, 2002).\nHowever, despite this attention, finding a systematic way to increase the flexibility\nof learning in higher education rarely moved much beyond provision of time flexibil-\nity and place flexibility (Ling et al., 2001). Web-based resources such as course-\nmanagement systems (CMSs) are frequently used, but primarily to allow flexible\naccess to information rather than for the systematic provision of options to learners\nin terms of a range of learning activities, resources, and supports (Mioduser &\nNachmias, 2001; Oliver & Herrington, 2001). Instructors need help in making deci-\nsions about how to design a CMS environment to increase the flexibility of their\ncourses beyond flexible information access (Morgan, 2003).\nIn order to increase instructors\u2019 support of flexibility within their courses in higher\neducation, at least two key steps need to occur: instructors need to think systemati-\ncally about different aspects of flexibility when designing their courses, and instruc-\ntors need to design and manage their CMS environments in order to support the\noptions for flexibility that they will make available in their courses. By reviewing and\nsynthesizing several pieces of research, this paper addresses these two steps and illus-\ntrates the general ideas with examples from a particular institution.\nThinking systematically about flexibility\nIn this section, we discuss a line of research in which we have been involved since the\nmid-1990s, with the focus on identifying sets of options with respect to flexibility that\ncan help instructors make choices about what can be offered in their courses. Based\non a literature review, 12 forms of within-course flexibility were identified that were\nsubsequently used as the basis for an international survey. From a factor analysis of\nthe survey responses, two main dimensions for within-course flexibility were identi-\nfied that help instructors in the systematic consideration of options for their own\ncourses. Each of these is summarized here.\nFrom a literature review and confirmatory interviews during 1995\u20131997, Collis\net al. (1997) identified 19 dimensions of course flexibility, which were grouped in five\nsets: flexibility related to time, to content, to entry requirements, to instructional\napproach and resources, and to delivery and related logistics. Twelve of these repre-\nsent aspects of flexibility that can be determined by instructors within their decisions\nfor course design and management. Table 1 presents these 12 aspects of flexibility\nunder instructor control.\nMethodology\nTo examine the extent to which these forms of flexibility are being offered in prac-\ntice by instructors in higher education and also to see whether the set can be simpli-\nfied further in terms of main dimensions useful to instructors in their design and\nBecoming more systematic about flexible learning 35\ncourse-management activities, questions relating to them were asked as part of an\ninternational comparative study on changes in higher education (2000\u20132002)\n(Collis & Van de Wende, 2002). In this international study (nine countries, includ-\ning seven in Europe), over 650 respondents (instructors, decision-makers and\nsupport professionals) within higher-education institutions gave their opinions relat-\ning to the variables in a model for predicting change. The purpose of this project\nwas to study factors that influence current models relating to change and technology\nuse in higher education, and that predict how institutions are likely to evolve, given\ntheir current conditions. The study was primarily sponsored by the SURF Founda-\ntion in The Netherlands and by the Bertelsmann Foundation in Germany.\nA questionnaire was developed and piloted. A set of items related to the flexibility\ndimensions in Table 1 were part of the questionnaire. For each of the 12 dimen-\nsions, instructors were asked \u2018To what extent do you offer options relating to each\nof the following to students in your own courses?\u2019. The response options were: (1)\nNo flexibility, (2) (Unlabelled), (3) Some flexibility, (4) (Unlabelled), (5) Extensive\nflexibility.\nFindings\nA selected sample of universities in the nine target countries was identified, using\ninformation sources in national Ministries of Education. Information and Communi-\ncation Technologies contact persons were contacted at each of the institutions, and\nasked to approach decision-makers, instructors, and support personnel in their insti-\ntution with the request to respond to the questionnaire. Approximately 30% of the\napproached institutions responded fully to the survey (for full details, see Collis &\nVan der Wende, 2002). From these institutions, 347 instructors responded to ques-\ntions relating to their current teaching practice and their predictions about this prac-\ntice several years in the future. Table 2 presents the means and standard deviations\nTable 1. Instructor choices in flexibility, grouped according to main categories\nFlexibility related to time Times for starting and finishing a course, Times for \nsubmitting assignments and interacting within the course, \nFlexibility in pace of learning\nFlexibility related to content Topics of the course, Orientation of course events \n(theoretical, practical), Assessment standards and \ncompletion requirements\nFlexibility related to instructional \napproach and resources\nWays in which the course is experienced (face-to-face; \ngroup, individual, combinations), Language to be used \nduring the course, Types and sources of learning resources, \nAssignments required for the course\nFlexibility related to course logistics In location of specific learning events, In times of specific \nlearning events\n36 W. de Boer and B. Collis\nof the responses of the instructor sample to the items relating to the flexibility dimen-\nsions presented in Table 1.\nTable 2 shows that most of the responses were within a standard deviation of \u2018Some\nflexibility\u2019. The relatively low scores confirm the observation that instructors are not\nyet regularly offering options with respect to flexibility in their courses, although vari-\nation in terms of types of flexibility does occur.\nIn order to further examine patterns in the data, a principle components analysis\nwas carried out on the responses to the nine items, using Varimax rotation with Kaiser\nnormalization, converging after nine iterations (De Boer, 2004). Two factors with\neigenvalues greater than 1.00 were retained for interpretation. These two factors\nexplain 45.95% of the variance. Table 3 presents the loadings of the flexibility-dimen-\nsion variables on the two retained factors. The loadings in bold indicate the factor\nrelated to each variable for subsequent interpretation. For convenience, loadings less\nthan 0.200 and dimensions with loadings less than 0.200 on the factors retained for\ninterpretation are not presented.\nFactor 1 relates strongly to six variables all involved with the decisions the instruc-\ntor makes in setting up a course. These could be called \u2018planning flexibility\u2019. Factor\n2 relates most closely to the learning setting as experienced within the course, the\nTable 2.

Although the results of the factor analysis do not present a clear division\nbetween planning\/logistic and pedagogic decisions, they do indicate that a systematic\napproach to within-course flexibility could proceed using these two dimensions.\nApplying the flexibility dimensions to the design and use of CMSs\nCMSs, sometimes called Virtual Learning Environments, are Web-based database-\ndriven systems that enable or support learning (for an overview, see http:\/\/\nwww.edutools.info\/course\/index.jsp, in which more than 70 commercially available\nCMSs can be compared around 40 different features). Despite this variety, the main\ncomponents of a typical CMS can be arranged around three sorts of tools for learning\nsupport: \n\u25cf Tools for course organization.\n\u25cf Tools for communication.\n\u25cf Tools for content and assignment creation and delivery.\nThe two dimensions relating to planning and interpersonal flexibility can be set out\nagainst these characteristic elements of a CMS, in order to suggest how each type of\nflexibility can be enabled or supported through a CMS. Table 4 presents such an over-\nview, where the flexibility examples are adapted from Collis (1998). The functional-\nities related to the three general sets of tools are common to most if not all CMSs.\nThe instructional and management decisions come from the instructor, not the CMS.\nTable 3.

Collis\nTable 4 confirms that, if designed appropriately a CMS can be a tool to support\ninstructors to be more flexible in their teaching. The two types of flexibility can be\nclearly supported in the options that a typical CMS offers. In addition, a number of\nprocedures have been suggested in Table 4 to operationalize flexibility in practice, in\nterms of the two dimensions of flexibility from the empirical study. CMSs therefore\ncan be used as integrated tools for individual instructors to support increased flexibil-\nity in their courses.\nThe rows in Table 4 are organized around familiar common components of a\nCMS. The nine items retained from the factor analysis as loading highly on the\ntwo flexibility clusters can be mapped onto the instructional and managerial ideas\nlisted in the two right-side columns. The planning dimensions can be seen to\nunderlie the specific examples in the \u2018planning\u2019 column, and the \u2018interpersonal\u2019\ndimensions can underlie the similarly named column. Often a particular flexibility\ndimension, such as that related to planning for the assignments within the course,\ncan be seen in a number of the decisions in the associated column. The next\nsection gives detailed examples of how this sort of systematic analysis is being used\nin practice.\nCase studies: examples from practice\nMethodology\nIn the previous section the use of a CMS to support the two major types of flexibil-\nity was discussed generically. We have also been studying these general ideas in\ndetailed form and in practical application in our own institution between 1997 and\n2003. This section will give specific examples of the flexibility options offered to\nstudents at the University of Twente in The Netherlands using the CMS in place at\nthat institution (De Boer, 2004). The cases have been selected to illustrate the prin-\nciples identified in the previous sections. The comments given relate to our invento-\nries of what the instructors in this specific institution are doing with respect to\noffering flexibility and supporting this via a CMS. It is important to take into\naccount that the CMS only supports the flexibility that instructors choose in their\ninstructional design or managerial decisions. The first six examples correspond to\nthe six variables loading on the Planning flexibility dimension as presented in Table\n3 and related to a CMS in Table 4, while the last three examples correspond to the\nthree variables loading on the Interpersonal flexibility dimension in Table 3, which\nare related generically to a CMS in Table 4. Most of the examples shown could be\ncarried out with any CMS.\nCase studies: Planning flexibility\nTimes for starting and finishing a course\nFlexibility in the times that students can start and end a course is being offered by\ninstructors through the use of the CMS. Some offer flexibility on both sides of the\nBecoming more systematic about flexible learning 41\ndefined times for a course. Instructors set up their course environment before the\nfirst session starts. The most elementary information and organization should be\nmade clear through the CMS. This gives an option for students to start their own\nplanning activities before the course actually starts. As a minimum within most\ncourses, the most elementary course information, content, and activity descriptions\nin the CMS course environments are up and running two weeks before the first\nsession, or other kick-off activity. In addition to this, a number of instructors use\nthe CMS for extending course dates. One example is when a small number of\nstudents are attending a course (e.g. a specialized elective in the Masters\nprogramme), and the students enrol at different times during the year. Figure 1\nshows the \u2018Roster\u2019 of a course environment of the educational programme for\nstudents in a certain teacher-training programme that offers this kind of flexibility.\nDifferent rows of the \u2018Roster\u2019 can be set up for different groups of students. (The\nRoster in the TeleTOP CMS is a matrix-like template that allows the instructor to\nset up the course organization in whatever table-based design the instructor\nchooses. Pages can be linked to each cell of the Roster to offer instructions, content\nobjects, and assignment resources, and via which the learners can submit their\nassignments and receive feedback.)\nFigure 1. Example of a Roster with activities that are not related to a specific time. Some are only visible for a subset of students (in this case, \u2018St Martin\u2019s College\u2019) while others are seen by all students\nTimes for submitting assignments and interacting within the course\nThe number of activities per course with graded submissions has increased since the\nintroduction of the CMS, and the number of scheduled contact sessions has\ndecreased. When using the CMS, instructors are offering opportunities to create flex-\nibility for students in terms of submission dates, while not themselves losing the over-\nview on these activities. The instructors use an \u2018administration tool\u2019 to see the\nsubmissions of students sorted in various ways, if feedback has been provided, and if\na grade has been given. All instructors make use of the administrative overviews in the\nCMS, and many note that these are highly valuable if not indispensable when they\noffer more and more variations to learners in terms of assignment due dates. Many\ninstructors are concerned about offering options to students in terms of the timing of\nsubmissions while still maintaining control over their own time. One way of doing this\nis to indicate to students that if they submit by the specified due date, they can expect\npersonalized feedback from the instructor within a set time (such as one week).\nFigure 1. Example of a Roster with activities that are not related to a specific time. Some are only \nvisible for a subset of students (in this case, \u2018St Martin\u2019s College\u2019) while others are seen by all students\n42 W. de Boer and B. Collis\nHowever, if students wish more flexibility and want to submit work later, they may\ndo so\u2014but the instructor cannot promise to have time allocated to given personalized\nfeedback, only a score and a reference to a model answer.\nTopics of the course\nThere are many possibilities for offering options that relate to the topics of a course.\nA number of instructors have adopted the \u2018contributing-student\u2019 pedagogy (Collis &\nMoonen, 2001), in which learners contribute in different ways to the resources avail-\nable in the CMS and then build on those contributions as the basis of subsequent\nactivities. Figure 2 shows some of the sorts of contributions that are becoming\ncommon within the university.\nFigure 2. Building on contributions: submissions made by participants (or re-used from previous participants) can be built upon in subsequent activitiesWith these options the content can be related to the context of the learners, which\nis a strong and flexible way to offer students relevant learning experiences. Examples\nof options for course materials involving student contributions that are being used by\nour instructors include: \n\u25cf Searching for additional information or examples and making these available for\nothers.\n\u25cf Working with a case as a basis for problem-solving and contributing some addi-\ntional materials for the case for use by others.\n\u25cf Participating in a role-play situation and leaving some record of the results of the\nrole play for others to consider.\n\u25cf Creating a report to then be used as a learning resource by others.\nFigure 2.

Figure 3 shows\nhow, within a course, students could choose from two major assignments as the final\nassignment. One assignment had a more practical focus, and the other a more theo-\nretical focus.\nFigure 3. Options in orientation through activities\nAssessment standards and completion requirements\nWhen the group of students is not homogeneous, the way instructors deal with the\nassessment standards and completion requirements is also flexible. One way instructors\ndo this is by organizing subgroups within the course and then making Roster rows that\nare only visible to specific subgroups. In these different rows, variations on the assess-\nment and completion requirements can be offered to different groups (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Roster in which two groups (Moscow and Distance students Twente) were distinguished\nAssignments required for the course\nAmong the examples of offering flexibility in assignments is that instructors permit\nstudents that already are in a working environment to adopt the assignments in such\na way so that they are relevant to their working contexts. Another way in which flex-\nibility can occur is through allowing students to do group work individually, with a\nFigure 3. Options in orientation through activities\n44 W. de Boer and B. Collis\nmodified assignment, if this is more convenient to them As another example, when\ninstructors have a number of activities within a course, they sometimes let students\nchoose those activities that would be most relevant or interesting to them individually.\nFigure 5 shows a course where this kind of flexibility was offered through the tasks.\nFigure 5. Options in tasks for students: Choose the \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018b\u2019 variant\nCase studies: interpersonal flexibility\nWays in which the course is experienced (group\/individual; sessions)\nThe way a student is participating within a course with regards to working alone or\nwith groups relates to interpersonal flexibility as well as planning flexibility. As\noperationalized in our institution, this aspect of flexibility is based on fewer lectures\nand more activities, and flexibility in course planning and communications. It is also\nFigure 4.

Options in tasks for students: Choose the \u2018a\u2019 or \u2018b\u2019 variant\nBecoming more systematic about flexible learning 45\nbased on offering different pedagogical approaches depending on the student\u2019s choice.\nDifferent CMS functionalities can be used to organize the processes of different\n(groups of) students. Figure 6 shows an example where this opportunity has been used.\nFigure 6. Example of flexibility in pedagogic approach related to attending a session\nLanguage to be used during the course\nWithin courses that deal with different groups of students, the languages in which\nstudents can study and interact within the course could also relate to a flexibility\ndimension. In an international context the language of all Masters-level courses our\nuniversity is now English. Sometimes, however, Dutch students prefer to do their\nassignments in the Dutch language, which they officially have the right to do. Instruc-\ntors have to deal with this. Also groups of students from outside The Netherlands\nsometimes wish to work together, in their own mother tongue. Ways to evaluate and\nlearn from each others\u2019 experiences and work are important, even where portions of\nthe work may be carried out in a different language. Instructors are identifying differ-\nent ways in which to blend English communication across groups with the language\nof choice within groups.\nTypes and sources of learning resources\nWithin the planning dimension there are many options that relate to the resources\nthat students contribute and use for activities. The idea of re-use of students\u2019 work\nFigure 6. Example of flexibility in pedagogic approach related to attending a session\n46 W. de Boer and B. Collis\nand of moments of good communication in a course supports flexibility: for those\nwho were not present when a moment of good communication occurred, for exam-\nple, or to facilitate the development of a substantial database of learning resources\nthat can be re-used and combined in many different combinations (Collis & Moonen,\n2001). An example of how video captures are being used as a flexible resource in a\ncourse that had both distance students and on-campus students is shown in Figure 7.\nGroup presentations are captured as streaming video and uploaded in the CMS for\nfollow-up reflections and activities.\nFigure 7. Example of how video captured on the fly is used as a new flexible resource\nConclusions: what about the instructor?\nA systematic approach to help instructors identify flexibility options and use a CMS\nto help them offer and manage the options is thus feasible in practice. However, the\nimplications of offering more flexibility for the instructor need to be also analysed and\nmanaged.\nThe planning type of flexibility can occur while maintaining more or less the same\nteaching and learning programme within a course, but offering more flexibility in\nterms of logistics. A major concern here is to help the instructor manage the different\noptions that are chosen by the students. However, course pedagogy tends not to be\nmuch altered.\nHowever, when interpersonal flexibility is adapted, this often implies a change in\npedagogy, such as with more student-centred contributions that relate to the experi-\nences of the individual students and can be re-used by others as learning resources. It\nis probably harder to make this change to interpersonal flexibility, because instructors\nneed to rethink their courses in terms of the activities within the course and also the\nassessment of those new activities.\nSupport for instructors is therefore very important. Research at the University of\nTwente and beyond shows that support for the instructor can be, and needs to be,\nimproved. In addition, once a clear goal from the management with regard to\nFigure 7. Example of how video captured on the fly is used as a new flexible resource\nBecoming more systematic about flexible learning 47\nflexibility is communicated, the means to support instructors should not only be\nfocused on the starting period of an innovation. Support needs to be near at hand to\nhelp instructors with more complicated instructional problems over time. On one\nhand instructors should work within an institutional environment that is encouraging\nthem to try new ideas in responding to the needs of their students, and on the other\nhand the institutional environment should be able to respond quickly to the needs\nand questions of instructors. Flexibility must be scalable and manageable as well as\nstudent-centred and responsive. Helping the instructor to find this balance and\nmanage it via the course CMS remains an issue in practice.\nReferences\nBates, T.
