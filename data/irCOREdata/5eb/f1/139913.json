Using the Circuit of Capital as an organizing framework the \npaper integrates RBV and Marx's value theory, by introducing the notion of value as \nsocially necessary labour time, into the analysis of resource based advantage.  This \nenables us to identify the impact of particular sources of competitive advantage as \nthey become diffused through an industry. Some resource based advantages, when \neventually imitated lead to an overall reduction in industry profitability, and other \nadvantages lead to increases in industry average profitability.\nKey words:\nvalue creation, resource based view, labour theory of value, industry profitability\nPage 3 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n2\nINTRODUCTION\nAn important problem in the strategic management literature is to establish linkages \nbetween managerial actions and their consequences in terms of measurable outcomes. \nIn one strand of this literature in particular, the resource based view (RBV) there is an \nexplicit acknowledgement that the theory cannot be fully developed without reference \nto a consistent and complete theory of value (Miller and Shamsie, 1996, p.539;\nMakadok and Coff, 2002). Although there have been significant contributions in the \ncritical accounting literature to the problem of value (Tinker, 1980, Bryer, 1994), \nwhich might assist in this respect, thus far there has been little interaction between the \naccounting and strategic management literatures. Both literatures are rooted in the \nclassical traditions of Marx and Ricardo, and in view of this commonality, rather than \nadd to the weight of critique of the RBV (for example and a summary see Priem and \nButler, 2001),  this paper assesses whether the RBV can be developed from a more \nrigorous application of its too often unacknowledged intellectual origins. The purpose \nof this paper is to propose an integration which offers the opportunity of a theory of \ncompetitive advantage consistent with a theory of value.\nThe field of strategic management concerns itself with identifying strategies\nthat allow some firms to produce \u2018super-normal\u2019 profits. From the 1980s the\nstructure-conduct-performance paradigm of industrial organisation economics \ndominated the field, which explained how competitive advantage derives from \nprivileged market positions. Following Porter (1980) the strategy problem could be \ndecomposed into decisions about 1) where to compete, as some markets are more \nstructurally attractive to incumbent firms than others; 2) how to compete, which \ninvolves a basic choice between two alternative \u2018generic strategies\u2019; and 3) strategy \nimplementation.\nPage 4 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n3\nFrom the early 1990s an alternative explanation of superior profit performance \nemerged, labelled the resource-based view (RBV). The RBV locates the sources of \nadvantage inside the firm and views the firm as a bundle of resources (Barney 1991; \nRumelt, 1984; Amit and Shoemaker, 1993; Carter and Mueller, 2006). Resources that \nare simultaneously valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable earn the firm rents \nin equilibrium. The RBV argument can be traced back to Selznick\u2019s (1957) idea of \n\u2018distinctive competences\u2019 and on Penrose\u2019s (1959), who perceived  the firm as a \ncollection of resources, and that performance depends on its ability to use them. \nThe RBV could be said to dominate discourse in the strategy field, and it has \nspawned other sub-fields like the knowledge-based view of the firm (e.g. Kogut and \nZander 1992; Grant, 1996), which focuses specific attention on knowledge resources, \nand the dynamic capabilities literature (Teece, Pisano and Shuen 1997; Eisenhardt and \nMartin 2000), which explores how firms can sustain resource-based advantages in\nrapidly changing environments. However, there are problems with the theory. For \nexample, it can be argued to be tautological as we cannot know whether a firm has \nunique capabilities independently of the description of them (Priem and Butler 2001; \nCarter et al, 2008). There are problems in empirically identifying unique resources: it \nis particularly difficult to attribute, unambiguously, superior performance to specific \nactivities or assets. Moreover, resources occur in configurations with complex \ninteraction effects between resources, some synergistic, others conflicting. And as a \ntheory of competitive advantage, the RBV has little advice to offer managers, and, to\ndate, there has been little empirical work into how resources come about.\nBut rather than address these and other problems with the RBV we focus here \non the question of value and what \u2018valuable\u2019 might mean in the RBV. We would \nsuggest that although the RBV is concerned with the role of valuable assets, it does \nPage 5 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n4\nnot have a theory of value, and is unlikely to find one from the neo-classical \nperspective that dominates the field. Instead, when not relying on conventional \neconomic theories of market imperfection, the RBV uses Ricardian rents to explain \nexcess profits (for example, Barney, 1986, Conner, 1991, Makadok, 2001, Peteraf, \n1993, Wernerfelt, 1984) as part of a taxonomy of rent earning opportunities (Peteraf, \n1994) These Ricardian RBV perspectives utilise the notions of inelastic factor supply \nor heterogeneous resource picking skills. In these respects, they are manifestations of \nclassical Ricardian approaches, but which ignore the neo-Ricardian approach. This is \nsurprising since Sraffa\u2019s, (1960) neo-Ricardian theory offers an explanation of wages, \nprofits and prices, consistent with Marx\u2019s first volume of Capital, all of which are \npotentially important to the establishment of a resource-based theory of the firm.\nSraffa\u2019s analysis offers a useful starting point, but only insofar as it explains the \ntechnical relationships between these categories in a homogeneous commodity-based \neconomy. In the RBV heterogeneous processes of value creation are all important\nand, as in Marx\u2019s more general analysis, a function of social relationships. \n` In the critical accounting literature, there has been much discussion of how \naccounting is implicated in the policing of the social relations of production. There \nhas also been much discussion of the nature of value, how it is measured and its \nrelation to the rate of profit (Tinker, 1980, Bryer, 1994, Toms, 2006a, 2006b, 2009a, \n2009b). There has also been some development of practical accounting techniques to \ndeal with the analysis of competitive advantage, although typically these have not \nincorporated the RBV (see for example Roslender and Hart, 2003). \nWhat is needed therefore is a model incorporating a robust theory of value, \nthereby explaining different profitability outcomes in different competitive situations. \nSuch a model is presented below in the remainder of the paper, which is structured as \nPage 6 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\nfollows. We begin with a summary of the RBV that concludes that there is sufficient \nscope within the view to justify the introduction of an explicit labour theory of value \nperspective. Then we compare in broad outline the RBV and Marx\u2019s labour theory of \nvalue and conclude that there are important and fundamental similarities between the \ntheories. We then set out a critical component of Marx\u2019s theory, the Circuit of Capital. \nWe use the notation of the circuit to explore four primary types of resource creation \nprocess. The processes of profit rate equalization are then considered, and we explore \nwhat happens to average industry profitability when these resource advantages are \nimitated. We explain that some types of resource advantage when diffused throughout \nthe industry lead to average profits falling, whilst other resource advantages, when \ncopied, lead to increases in average profitability. Finally propositions are set out that \ncapture the essential arguments of the paper. \nDEFICIENCIES IN THE RBV\nRecent literature has recognised the need for a theory of value, and, as a result, two \nquite narrow and to some extent mutually exclusive perspectives have emerged. One \nstrand examines processes within the organisation (Denrell et al., 2003), addressing \nvalue creation through adaptive learning, whilst another considers market interactions, \nparticularly the division of value through bargaining games (Lippman and Rumelt, \n2003a, 2003b). The first perspective concentrates on the role of human activity in \ncreating competitive advantage, but without reference to a value creation process. The \nsecond perspective sets out some theoretical problems with the neoclassical \nunderpinnings of the RBV, and puts forward an alternative, the bargaining and \npayments perspectives, which offer a theory of rent and value distribution, but again \nPage 7 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\nwithout considering the process of value creation. In another example of this \napproach, value is merely a function of market structure, or the presence of a willing \nbuyer (MacDonald and Ryall, 2004). \nTo develop these interpretations further a theory which reconciles value \ncreation and value distribution is necessary. Recent literature has begun to explore \nthis possibility. Using the distinction between separable, typically physical, and \nembedded resources, or assets, which include brand value, processes and procedures,\nBowman and Swart (2007) usefully extend the Lippman and Rumelt (2003a) \nbargaining perspective to inside the organisation. They develop a model to show the \nlinks between embedded capital, which is created from ambiguity surrounding the \nrent creating contributions of human capital, and the capture of rents thereby \ngenerated by owners, managers and employees, which depends on the extent to which \nassets are separable or embedded.i\nEmbedded capital is therefore a useful starting point for the analysis of \nprofitability, and can be extended in a number of ways. First, the notion of embedded \ncapital as a process is extended explicitly to include the labour process. Because it is \nconcerned with power (for example Knights 1990) and not valorisation (Nicholls, \n1999), the potential contribution of labour process theory (LPT) to the RBV and \ntheories of competitive advantage has been ignored. Knowledge and human capital \nassets are meanwhile regarded as sources of competitive advantage in the RBV and\nelsewhere (Grant, 1996). If the LPT perspective is adopted the notion of knowledge \nworkers as owners of capital (Drucker, 1993) can be abandoned. Using an LPT \nperspective, value creation occurs only in the labour process and not through social \ncapital or similar osmosis. \nPage 8 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nA second important extension is therefore the adoption of the labour theory of \nvalue (LTV), and with it the idea of socially necessary labour.ii LTV provides a \nconsistent explanation of the source of surplus, in the mental and physical actions of \nlabour as a common component of all commodities, explaining why they are \nsystematically sold at above the value of the other separable inputs. Third, embedded \ncapital is not in itself sufficient to explain the distribution of surplus between workers, \nmanagers and shareholders. The outcome depends also on the processes of \naccountability, which begin with valorisation in the labour process. Here the \nmanagement accounting system ascribes homogenous monetary values to \nheterogeneous outputs from the service delivery or production process. Because the \nprocess is less easily observable in the case of embedded capital, the probability of \nasymmetry between the social value of the labour expended and the realised monetary \namount increases. In other words there is a greater probability that workers will \nappropriate rent by receiving the same wage through lower effort. Managers will \ntherefore use the management accounting system to reduce information asymmetry \nwhilst retaining the competitive advantage that embedded capital brings. They will \nappropriate rents themselves if successful, but their ability to do so will be influenced \nin turn by the transparency provided to owners through governance, audit and \nfinancial accounting. In this case the potential asymmetries are greater because \ninvestors are typically non-expert and in any case may mitigate risk through portfolio \ndiversification rather than firm specific monitoring arrangements. Monitoring through \ninternal and external accounting and governance processes is in itself a costly \nexercise, which reduces the availability of surplus to managers and outside investors.\nAdding these three elements, labour process, labour theory of value and \naccounting process to the notion of embedded capital introduces Marx\u2019s definition of \nPage 9 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\nand theory of value into the RBV conversation. Gaining some clarity about what is \nmeant by \u201cvalue\u201d, and by \u201cvaluable\u201d resources within the RBV should lead to a \nstrengthening of the perspective and should provoke some new lines of inquiry, some \nof which are pursued here. In particular, by introducing Marx\u2019s concepts of value and \nsurplus value we can explore the impacts of resource advantages as they become \nimitated, diffused through a set of close competitors. In this way we are able to effect\nlinkages between the firm level analysis of competitive advantage, and the analysis of \nrelative industry profitability.\nDEVELOPING THE RBV\nProponents of the RBV generally argue that human or 'cultural' resources are the \nsources of above normal returns, not purchasable and tradable physical assets \n(Barney, 1986; Castanias and Helfat, 1991). This is because physical inputs like \ncomputers or machinery can usually be purchased by competing firms, thus any \nadvantage from buying a better piece of equipment is usually rapidly eroded, as \ncompeting firms are free to acquire the same equipment.  In contrast, valuable human \nresources such as specially skilled or talented employees, or resources that take the \nform of embedded tacit routines, tend to be difficult to replicate and can therefore \nenable the firm possessing these resources to sustain higher levels of profit. \nIn most firms both the performance of valuable behaviours within the routines, \nsocial networks, and cultures of the organization (Nelson and Winter, 1982), and the \ndirection and deployment of these resources with other inputs, are activities \nundertaken by hired employees, be they executives, middle managers or shop-floor \nworkers.  This implies that sustained profitability derives from the actions of various \ntypes of labour working on and with other inert inputs (Lado and Wilson, 1994; \nPage 10 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\nPfeffer, 1995).  Thus, within resource-based theorizing the \"resources\" that produce \nrents are more likely to be human resources, rather than physical or inert resources.\nRBV recognizes that resources can be built or bought. The deliberate creation \nof resources would also be a managerial activity, and the processes of resource \ncreation executives enact have been described as dynamic capabilities (Teece et al., \n1997).  Unlike the Ricardian perspective, which relies only on artful procurement (or \n\u2018resource picking\u2019, Makadok 2001), the dynamic capabilities perspective depends on \nthe artful deployment of inert and human resources. In the first case surplus arises \nthrough the transfer of resource from one organisation to another. In the second case \nvalue is created through non-replicable management action as part of the labour \nprocess.\nThere are strong parallels between RBV reasoning and Marx's economics.  \nMarx adopts a \"human resource\" based theory of value and surplus value.  His theory \nrepresents an advanced form of the labour theory of value developed by prior \n\"classical\" economists, notably Smith, Mill and Ricardo. In line with Marx's theory, \nthe RBV explicitly acknowledges that the value created by a particular resource is not \nfully returned to the resource provider (Rumelt, 1984; Peteraf, 1993). The rents \nproduced by the special resource have to be captured by the capitalist, not the \nresource provider or supplier, if super-normal profits are to accrue to the firm. Thus, \nRBV separates the creation of value from the capture of value: rents only lead to \nsuper-normal profits if they can be appropriated from the resource provider (Bowman \nand Ambrosini, 2000; Coff 1999). Marx's theory of value and profit also clearly \ndistinguishes between value creation (exploitation in the labour process) and value \ncapture (appropriation of profit). It is therefore fundamentally congruent with this \nbasic tenet of the RBV.\nPage 11 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\nThere are further important similarities between Marx's argument and the \nRBV. They both argue that super-normal profits result from the firm's possession of \nunique and valuable resources, and that the rent-generating or surplus-generating \ncapacity of these resources may be temporary if these resources can be imitated:\n\"a manufacturer who employs a new invention before it becomes \ngenerally used, undersells his competitors, and yet sells his commodity \nabove its individual value, that is realizes the specifically higher \nproductiveness of the labour he employs as surplus labour. He thus \nsecures a surplus profit.\" (Marx, 1954, III: 238) \nBoth theories also recognize that the bargaining power of resource suppliers is a \ncritical determinant of firm profitability. Marx argues that it is the capitalist's control \nover access to specific inanimate resources (the \"means of production\") that enables \nthe exploitation of labour to take place.  Put another way, if individuals are able to \nearn a living by selling the products of their labour directly, rather than through \nselling their labour-power, then they have no need to contract with owners of capital.  \nExploitation can only take place where this alternative is denied the worker, and this \nis primarily the result of developments in what Marx terms the \"forces of production\" \ne.g. economies of scale.\nAccording to the RBV, the physical assets that are the precursor of this \nrelationship between capitalist and worker are unlikely to be the source of super-\nnormal profits.  As argued earlier, these assets, which are usually tradable and readily \navailable, are likely to be common across competing firms.  But the problem is they \nare expensive.  They are expensive but not unique, and hence they do not qualify as \nresources, in resource-based thinking.  Access to these resources is rationed because \nof their costs of production, not because of their inherent uniqueness.  If these assets \nPage 12 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\nbecame very cheap, then efficient scale production could be undertaken by individuals \nand self-organized groups without the involvement of the capitalist.  So capital, in its \nmoney form, is homogeneous, therefore, it cannot pass the test of a resource in the \nRBV.  However, capital enables its owner to capture surplus value, as it is required in \nall scale-sensitive areas of production.  If the required physical assets to produce, for \nexample, steel, cars, or electricity were inexpensive, if they were within the reach of \nmost people, then capital would have to retreat from these industries.  \nSo, in this sense, Marx's theory is also a resource-based theory. In his \nargument, the scarce resource is money capital. When this resource is rendered \nredundant because it is not required for socially efficient production, the people \ninvolved in creating new value are able to capture the full fruits of their labour.  Both \ntheories deal with the phenomenon of entry barriers, but there is a crucial distinction \nbetween them.  In Marx's economics, the barrier to entry is primarily money capital: a \nsufficient sum of money must be advanced before socially efficient production can \nbegin.  It is, then, a quantitative barrier to entry.  In the RBV, barriers to entry, or \nbarriers to imitation exist which permit the firm to earn rents for sustained periods of \ntime.  Here the barriers are typically qualitative: they consist of subtle differences in \nwork process, reputations, and personal relationships that constitute the firm's rent-\ngenerating resources. Although we would expect that most resources in the firm \nwould be forms of labour in action, RBV also recognizes that inert inputs into the \nproductive process can also be resources e.g. special equipment, a brand. However, \nthese resources should be considered as intermediate use values involved in the \nproductive process that are themselves the products of labour in action. Either the \nintermediate inert use value has been artfully procured, or it has been created by \npeople inside the firm. If artful procurement creates resources for the firm this must \nPage 13 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\nmean that the value of the resource in its current deployment is greater than the price \nthat was originally paid for it.\nThe RBV offers an explanation of how firms can earn super-normal profits \nin equilibrium. The RBV is rooted in neo-classical thinking, where the notion of \nequilibrium forms a central plank of theory building. Thus equilibrium is a useful \nconstruct to assist in theory development, but we would not expect equilibria to exist \nin reality. Marx and Schumpeter (and other Austrian School economists) take a \ndynamic view of markets and economies, which taken at face value seems to be a \nmore promising place to start building theories about relative firm performance. The \nprocesses of \u2018creative destruction\u2019, and Marx\u2019s explanation of the \u2018moral \ndepreciation\u2019 of capital recognise that competitive advantages have a limited shelf-\nlife. We believe the assumptions about equilibrium can be explained by the RBV\u2019s \nneo-classical roots. Insights about the idiosyncratic sources of advantage the RBV \nprovides are still interesting and important even if we relax the equilibrium \nconditions. Thus, in what follows we take a longer-run notion of competitive \nadvantage than that implied by the RBV. Specifically, we assume that resource based \nadvantages can exist at a point in time, but that processes of imitation and replication \nwill, over time, lead to these resource advantages being eroded. So, we are relaxing a \nstrict interpretation that resources are indefinitely non-imitable, suggesting instead \nthat inimitability reduces over time. Such adjustments to resource advantage are \nmirrored by adjustments in socially necessary labour. The discovery of a new, more \nefficient system will reduce the socially necessary labour time to produce the same \ngoods. The firm making the discovery enjoys competitive advantage because all other \nfirms must employ labour above the socially necessary minimum. In the longer run, \nless well-endowed firms lose market share to the efficient firm and exit the industry, \nPage 14 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\nor alternatively, the leading firm is imitated, so that the new social minimum is \ngeneralised to the industry.\nMeanwhile, because there is embedded capital, causal ambiguity and \ninformation asymmetry, the division of surplus (including the transfer of rents from \nother firms as the leading firm gains market share) within the efficient firm is \nindeterminate. In this firm, monitoring costs are high to begin with as embedded \ncapital is created, and these costs diminish through time as tacit knowledge in \nemployees is generalised into managerial and other forms of explicit, but firm specific \nknowledge. Even at the end of the process, monitoring cost is greater than zero, \ntherefore there is always a social minimum monitoring cost. From the point of view of \ncapital, the realised rate of surplus across firms and industries is a function of the \nsocial minimum variable capital minus the social minimum monitoring cost. The \nlatter is a cost of circulation, necessary for the functioning of capital but not a \nnecessary production cost and does not therefore form part of society\u2019s stock of \nvaluable assets. \nAccounting labour, for example administration and bookkeeping are \ntherefore classes of unproductive labour in circulation costs that act as deductions \nfrom profit (Marx, 1978, pp.207-211). To extend this notion into our analysis of \nprofitability, it is necessary to extend the scope of socially necessary labour to include \nsocially necessary labour costs in circulation. Whereas this labour is unproductive, \nsince it arises from the social relations of production under capitalism, it is \nnonetheless required for capitalism to function so that the valorisation of the labour \nprocess can be completed through the realisation of money capital in the circuit of \ncapital. There is accordingly a socially efficient level of labour required to sustain this \nprocess.\nPage 15 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n14\nCombining Marx's economics with the fine-grained insights into variations in \nfirm-level profitability provided by the RBV enables us to develop a categorization of \ntypes of labour.  This can then be used to explain changes in firm profitability, and \nstrategies employed to counter falling profitability, specifically how firms\u2019 counter \nwhat Marx refers to as the \"moral depreciation\" of capital. Moreover, we can use this \nintegration to explore the effects of resource imitation on industry profitability.\nThe basic arguments of the RBV have been set out above in the context of the \ncurrent debate (Priem and Butler, 2001).  Marx's argument requires some integration, \nand in the next section we shall attempt to briefly summarize the aspects of his work \nmost relevant to the RBV. His circuit of capital approach explains capital as a \nprocess, and it will provide the conceptual underpinning for the paper.\nMARX'S \"CIRCUIT OF CAPITAL\"\n---------------------------------\nInsert Figure 1 about here\n---------------------------------\nFigure 1 sets out the circuit of capital.  It has two spheres: the sphere of production \nand the sphere of circulation.  The circuit captures the essential aspects of the process \nof capital accumulation (Marx, 1954; Fine and Harris, 1979).  Marx employs three \ndifferent types of \u2018value\u2019 in his argument: use value, exchange value and value. Use \nvalue refers to the physical or other properties of a commodity that provoke a demand \nfor it; use value is product utility. Exchange value is the monetary value that the \nproduct exchanges for; it is value in its money form. Value refers to the labour time \nembodied in the commodity. Taking Marx\u2019s macroeconomic perspective, value refers \nPage 16 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n15\nto socially necessary labour in the abstract i.e. the labour is a portion of total labour \ndeployed across the system as a whole.\nIn order to explain cases of heterogeneous labour productivity and resource \nendowment, the model begins with a simple benchmark describing homogeneous \ncommodity production. In the benchmark case, the value rate of profit and money rate\nof profit are equal, and this is also a useful base-case for the RBV, since firms earn \nthe general rate of profit and there is no competitive advantage. Where market prices \nform the prices of production, non-Ricardian competitive advantage or disadvantage\ndepends on the difference between the money value of labour paid and the money \nvalue of socially necessary labour. Socially necessary labour is defined as the \nmonetary equivalent of the required labour time in the most efficient firm. In the less \nefficient firm, rent accrues to labour at the expense of surplus in the form of wage \npayments above the socially necessary level. Because the labour process generates \nasymmetric information and monitoring costs attenuated by accounting controls the \nsurplus appropriated even in the most efficient firm is lower that the total appropriable \nsurplus. To the notion of Ricardian rents, therefore is added the notion of \u2018labour \nrents\u2019 which arise from the social productive process and whose magnitude is \nmediated by the effectiveness of accounting controls. For example a labour rent \nwould arise inversely to lost profit where a worker takes more time for a task than the \nsocially necessary required time. Individual firm profits are therefore heterogeneous \nas a function of combinations of standard RBV Ricardian rents, labour rents arising \nfrom differences in efficiency and labour rents arising from the ineffectiveness of \naccounting controls. The general rate of profit is formed through adjustments of \nmoney wages to the socially necessary equivalent through imitation; a process which \nis continually disrupted by new developments of dynamic capabilities. \nPage 17 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n16\nThe simple benchmark circuit begins with M, a sum of money advanced as \ncapital.  In order for this capital to \"self-expand\", it has to be transformed into \nproductive resources.  Thus, money capital, M, is converted into inputs, labour power \n(LP) and means of production (MP).  C is a sum of labour value made up of value \n\"stored\" in the machinery, and the value in the collection of wage goods required to \n\"produce\" the labourer. So C is a sum of value, a quantity of socially necessary labour \ntime embodied in machinery etc. and wage goods.\nThe sum of value advanced procures two types of capital. The first is c, \nconstant capital. It is constant because it cannot create more value than it already \nembodies. So the value embodied in the procured means of production MP remains \nconstant through the productive process. In contrast, v is variable capital, as it has the \ncapacity to create value and surplus value over and above the costs of its production, \nrepresented by wage goods. So labour power has the capacity to re-create the value \nadvanced for wage goods i.e. it can produce sufficient new value to pay for itself, and \nit is also capable of producing surplus value. The working day is divided into the time \nspent on creating the sum of value advanced as wages (v) and the remainder of the \nday, which produces surplus value (s) procured by the capitalist. The ratio s to v Marx \nrefers to as the rate of surplus value, or the rate of exploitation.\nSo MP and LP are joined in the process of production P. MP and LP are use \nvalues that combine to produce new use values in the form of commodities. Labour \npower working with the means of production (i.e. machinery, components, electricity) \ncreates commodities with a value of C\u2032.  These commodities then have to enter the \nsphere of circulation in order for the value and surplus value created in the production \nprocess to be realized.  The exchange of C\u2032 for cash realises a quantity of money \n(M+m) where m represents the surplus value created in the production process, \nPage 18 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n17\nappropriated by the capitalist in the form of profit. m is the monetary expression of \nsurplus value. From m, the costs of circulation, including monitoring costs are \ndeducted.\nThus the circuit begins with a sum of exchange value M. This is converted into \nthe use values of labour power and the means of production. The value of these inputs \nis the socially necessary labour required to produce the means of production c and to \n\u201cproduce\u201d the labourers v. In the production process new use values are created, a \nbundle of commodities which we shall label K subsequently, which have a value of C\u2019 \n(which is the sum of c+v+s). When these are sold, the use values are exchanged for a \nsum of money M+m. \nMarx argues that m cannot all be frittered away on luxury consumption.  The \nexternal coercive laws of competition force the capitalist to reinvest m in an attempt to \nextend his ability to extract even more surplus value, and as a defensive measure to \npreserve the original value of M. Competition between capitals leads to \u2018moral \ndepreciation\u2019 of the concrete means of production owned by the capitalist.  \nInnovations in productive processes devalue past investments in machinery, and \nchanging consumer tastes or product innovations can devalue the commodities (C') \nthe capital can produce.  So re-investment is also a defensive necessity for the \nindividual capitalist.  \nWe can now explore some dynamic processes within this circuit that affect the \nvalue of a particular capital.  First, we echo the concerns of RBV by exploring the \ncase of super-normal profits.  Then we examine the processes that tend to bring about \nan equalization of profit rates within an industry.  \nPage 19 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n18\nAverage Capitals\nAn average capital in a particular industry will be producing an average return.  Using \nthe notation in the circuit of capital, and representing this as a process, we have:\nmMsvcCKLPMPPvcCM \uf02b\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae ),,('),(),(\nWhere, to recap, M is a sum of money advanced as capital that is converted \ninto productive capital. C is a value construct, not a monetary amount. It represents \nthe sum of labour time embodied in the constant capital c required for socially \nefficient production, and v, variable capital is the amount of value that makes up the \nsum of wage goods advanced for the labour time of the employees. Then the two \nprocured components of capital, constant c and variable v combine in a productive \nprocess P.  c and v are now in the form of concrete or specific use values, the means \nof production MP, and labour power LP. The productive process produces \ncommodities K which have a value of C\u00b4, which comprises the c used up in the \nproductive process, the variable capital v employed, and surplus value s created in the \nproduction process.

If and when these products are sold \nthey realize a sum of exchange value M+m where m is the monetary equivalent of the \nsurplus value s created, minus the costs of circulation. \nIn the average capital or firm in an industry, LP would consist of \nhomogeneous labour power LPh, and homogeneous constant capital MPh.

In each case of resource advantage the created resource is valuable \nin conventional terms because it confers a per unit margin improvement relative to the \naverage firm. Such advantage results from either lower relative unit costs or higher \nrelative prices multiplied by the mass of commodities the capital produces. We start \nwith the straightforward case of economies of scale.\nScale Advantage\nHere the firm has achieved scale advantage ahead of competitors, as a result of the \ndevelopment of a new process. We can assume that this first mover advantage results \nfrom increases in the quantity of constant capital employed:\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b \uf02b\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae mMsvcCKLPhMPPvcCM ),,('),(),(\nwhere \nmmandCCKKMPMPCCMM \uf03e\uf0a2\uf03e\uf02b\uf0a2\uf03e\uf03e\uf03e\uf03e \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf02b ,,,,\nPage 21 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n20\nAssuming that scale advantages do exist in this case, then additionally:\n)()( MMmm \uf02d\uf03e\uf02d \uf02b\uf02b\nWe would expect that profits (m) from a previous circuit have been retained \nand invested in capital equipment (M+ converted into means of production MP+ that \nhave a value of c+). The effect of this additional quantity of constant capital is to \nincrease the productivity of labour power, which results in a higher volume of \ncommodities produced in the circuit (K+) relative to the average capital (K). If we \nassume the market price for these commodities is set by the average capital, this scale \nefficient firm is able to capture additional profit due to its lower costs of production. \nThe resource that has been created by this first mover investment in scale efficient \nprocesses and the value of this resource is the per unit margin improvement multiplied \nby the mass of commodities the capital produces.\nHowever, if we inspect the changes in value dimensions a different picture \nemerges. Any investment in scale efficient equipment is an investment in constant \ncapital. By definition constant capital cannot create more value than it embodies; it \ncannot create surplus value. The amount of surplus value created in this process \nremains the same as that in the average capital (s). How are we to account, then, for \nthe additional profits earned? \nMarx was very aware of the processes of \u2018creative destruction\u2019. He uses the \nconcept of socially necessary labour to capture the ongoing developments in \nprocesses that increase the productivity of labour. In the case of the scale efficient \nfirm modelled here, the socially necessary amount of labour power required to \nproduce this bundle of commodities has been redefined.  Those competing capitals \nthat have not been able to imitate these scale efficient processes are now employing \nmore labour power than is socially necessary.  As long as this persists the market \nPage 22 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n21\nprice of these commodities will be set by the average capital, enabling the RBV firm \nto sustain its superior rate of profit.  Of course, the scale efficient firm could choose to \nundercut its competitors, and maybe drive them out of business, but we will assume \nthat the firm chooses to take the margin advantage.\nSo the first-mover\u2019s investment in scale efficient production has had the effect \nof redefining the amount of socially necessary labour required to produce these \ncommodities.  Thus although the surplus value created in the process remains the \nsame as the average, the scale efficient capital is able to charge prices above the \nlabour value embodied in the commodities it produces.  Prices reflect the average \ncapital\u2019s costs of production which now includes a proportion of socially unnecessary\nlabour time.\nAssuming that scale economies do indeed lower the unit costs of each \ncommodity the monetary rate of profit should increase even though more M has been \nadvanced (M+) to fund the investments in equipment etc. But although the monetary \nrate of profit will have increased for this firm:\nM\nm\nM\nm \uf03e\uf02b\n\uf02b\nthe value rate of profit has declined:\nvc\ns\nvc\ns\n\uf02b\n\uf03c\n\uf02b\uf02b\nWe would not expect investments in scale efficient production to lead to \nsustained advantage, particularly where the scale efficient equipment is procured. \nInvestments in bought-in machinery etc are likely to be readily imitated. The effects \nof other firms imitating this move would be the redefinition of the socially necessary \nPage 23 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n22\namount of labour required to produce these products. In the circuit the average\namount of constant capital will have increased from c to c+.  \nThe first mover achieving scale advantage has invested ahead of the \ncompetition. The obvious source of the additional M invested is the retained m from a \nprior circuit. This is essentially Marx\u2019s process of accumulation. Because the \ninvestment is in explicit production processes and separable physical capital, m is \nreduced by circulation costs to only a minimal extent. But a consequence of this \nprocess of accumulation is an increase in the ratio of constant capital c to variable \ncapital v. We consider some of the ramifications of this later in the paper.\nWe now turn our attention to three more typical sources of resource-based \nadvantage. First we consider the situation where differentiated labour power creates \nintermediate use values that add to the efficiency or effectiveness of the firm\u2019s capital. \nIntermediate use values are assets like special equipment, systems, brands, databases, \nand patents. As inert use values they form part of constant capital.\nIntermediate Use Values\nDifferentiated labour (LPd) could create intermediate use values in a prior circuit of \ncapital. Here the actions of labour have resulted in a qualitative improvement in \nconstant capital (MP becomes MPd). So whereas Marx generally treats constant \ncapital as homogeneous, constant capital with differential capabilities can be created \ninternally within the firm by the actions of labour. We can represent this process of \nresource creation by setting out two sequential but abbreviated circuits of capital. \nHere differential labour creates better quality intermediate use values:\n\u2026. \uf0ae\uf02b\uf0ae\uf0ae mMKLPMP dh , \uf02b\uf02b \uf02b\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae mMKLPMPM hd ,\ncircuit n           circuit n + 1\nPage 24 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n23\nBut note that in circuit n some labour power has been diverted from the \nproduction of commodities to the development of superior intermediate use values \nlike better systems, brands, equipment. These then confer advantage in subsequent \ncircuits of capital n+1 etc. The process at work here is knowledge co-production with \ncausal ambiguity so that MPd is embedded capital. However the ambiguity produces \nindeterminate pay-offs in the valorisation process. Three specific permutations can be \nconsidered as defining or limiting cases. In the first case, represented above, \ndifferential labour in the first circuit is transformed into homogenous labour in the \nsecond. In other words, the labour process is reorganised instantaneously so that the \ntacit knowledge in LPd is transferred into MPd as complex but separable capital that \ncan be operated by homogeneous de-skilled labour. In this case profit accumulation \nproceeds smoothly and m is only diminished by the socially normal monitoring cost. \nEven so, the problem for capital is in the first circuit since there is no mechanism for \ntranslating LPd into the full value of m and the amount available for reinvestment in \nthe second circuit necessary to create MPd is constrained. Therefore even in this \nlimiting case, because value is created from skilled labour, suppliers of skilled labour \nalways appropriate a positive rent in the first period when their labour is used in the \nco-production of knowl dge assets. The second case is the same, except that the same \namount of LPd is also required in subsequent periods. In the third case monitoring \nmechanisms are insufficient to account immediately for the revised value generation \narrangements in the labour process. As we go through each of the three cases it can be \nseen that the proportion of value appropriated as m diminishes, such that the likely \noutcome in case three is normal profit, as the extra value created through the new \nprocess approaches 100%. In all three cases the amount realised through m is \nPage 25 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n24\ninsufficient for accumulation purposes, and so the subsequent circuit requires \nsupplementary investment from new capital.\nAs with the investment in scale efficient processes, the internal development \nof intermediate use values like better procedures, better equipment, patents etc results \nin an increase in constant capital c. These resource developments in circuit n become \n\u201cdead labour\u201d in circuit n+1. And as with the case of investments in procured \nequipment the augmentation of constant capital without any commensurate increase in \nthe rate of surplus value (s\/v) would result in a reduction in the value rate of profit, \nand again this is progressively accentuated in the three cases above. So although the \nco-production of knowledge assets creates the theoretical basis for competitive \nadvantage, and indeed an actual advantage in the sense that rent-seeking employees \nand managers of other firms attempt to copy the leading firm\u2019s state of the art \nworking methods, the underlying value rate and the realised rate of profit remain \nnormal.\nEconomizing on Constant Capital\nA third source of resource advantage would be resources that enable the firm to \nincrease the rate of capital turnover. Resources that might deliver this advantage may \nwell be work methods that make better use of bought-in material and equipment. \nAlthough the same capital is advanced as under the previous less efficient method, the \nrate of realisation into M is speeded up, so that more capital turnovers are possible in \na given time period. The effect is to increase the rate of profit. Examples might \ninclude the introduction of just-in-time (JIT) delivery systems. Again several \nscenarios are possible. In the part of the value chain administering JIT, the socially \nnecessary labour in circulation costs falls. To see the overall impact however, the \nwhole value chain must be considered. If the impact of the firm\u2019s introduction of JIT \nPage 26 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n25\nis that suppliers must hold more stock than previously, there is merely a reallocation \nof the aggregate value chain total profit through increased capital turnover in the \ncustomer firm and a corresponding reduction in the supplier. If on the other hand \nsome technical process delivers improvements throughout the value chain, for \nexample computerisation, the socially necessary labour in circulation costs falls and \nthe aggregate capital turnover and rate of profit rises. The net effect depends on the \nrelative scale of these processes and the bargaining power of firms in the value chain. \nA powerful firm will collect rents from weaker firms through trade-offs in the profit \nallocation process. If the vehicle for this diffusion process were consultants (e.g. SAP, \nMRP, QA, JIT systems) then firms buying the systems would be adding to their stock \nof constant capital c and the net effect would be to reduce the average rate of profit. \nCodification then also increases the possibility that these advantages can be replicated \nin rival firms. Procured systems like these would then be intermediate use values like \nthose considered above.\n\u201cBought\u201d Resources\nThese procured systems could not be resources as they would confer equivalent use \nvalue to the firms that bought them. But resources can be bought. Since price differs \nfrom value, but price = value in the aggregate, it follows that resources can be bought \nat, above or below their true value. In the case where they are acquired at below \nvalue:\nmMKsvcCPLPMPvcCM hh \uf02b\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf02d ),,('),(),(\nHere the sum advanced for socially efficient production M- is less than that \nadvanced by competing capitals. So although the amount of value created is the same \nas in competing capitals (c+v+s), the exchange value advanced for the specific LP\nand MP was less than that advanced in competing capitals. If as in the case of this \nPage 27 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n26\ncircuit the use values conferred by the procured inputs are equivalent to the use values \nof the average capital, then strictly this firm does not possess a resource advantage. \nThe \u201cresource\u201d existed in a prior circuit and it consisted of special procurement \nexpertise or insight. Again because the market price is set by the average capital this \nresource endowed firm is able to earn a superior rate of profit:\nM\nm\nM\nmmM \uf03e\uf02b\uf02d \uf02d\n\uf02d )(\nBut would it be possible to acquire true resources that have differential use \nvalue (i.e. acquire MPd or LPd)? The value of these resources would be the costs of \ntheir production, in labour time units. Although the specific use values of the procured \nMP and LP may be differentiated we have no reason to suppose that their values\nwould be any more or less than undifferentiated inputs procured by the average firm. \nHence even in the case of the procurement of true resources the value rate of profit \n(s\/(c+v)) may be the same for the resource-endowed firm as for the average firm. The \nRBV arrives at the same conclusion, since the ability to purchase implies imitability \nand hence normal profit.\nThere is a fourth form of resource based advantage that is more likely to be \nsustainable because it does not involve the creation of intermediate use values, and \nhence does not result in an increase in constant capital c. Advantage here derives from \nimprovements in the rate of surplus value.\nIncreasing the Rate of Surplus Value\nMarx defines the rate of surplus value, or the rate of exploitation as the ratio s\/v. \nResource-based advantages can be developed that operate directly on this ratio. Any \nimprovements in learning, experience, skills etc that a firm can achieve ahead of \ncompetitors may have the effect of reducing the given quantity of v required to \nPage 28 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n27\nproduce the average quantity of commodities K. These improvements in productivity \nwould not necessarily involve any investments or changes in MP, so c would not be \naugmented. Here the rate of surplus value has increased through resources that require \nless v for an average bundle of commodities K:\nmMKsvcCPLPMPvcCM dh \uf02b\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae\uf0ae \uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d ),,(),(),(\n'\nwhere \nv\ns\nv\ns \uf03e\uf02d\nThe actual improvement in the rate of profit depends however on the ability of \nmanagement to observe v. In the earlier case we considered knowledge co-production \nand the limited opportunities for improvements in the labour process to accrue to s. If \nwe now consider the case of increased organisational learning which comes purely \nfrom LPd, the problem of higher profit realisation is intensified. This case reflects \nincreased tacit knowledge on the part of the skilled employee, which is by definition \nnot directly observable. Faced with monitoring problems, management or external \nstakeholders might resort to action or output type control mechanisms (Ouchi and \nMaguire, 1975). Where the task is complex, the management accounting system \ntherefore retreats from action and behaviour controls, since their application requires  \nunderstanding a technical labour process from a non-technical point of view. Instead \nit relies on performance, or output control, so that the employee may set their own \nlevel of efficiency provided the target is met. Because the managers have no technical \nknowledge of the tacit process, they are forced to rely on their understanding of \nsocially necessary labour when setting standard costs. Typically they will set these \nstandards with reference to competitor firms or incrementally from historical practices \nin their own firm. In all scenarios of this kind, the employee appropriates the gain \nfrom improved tacit knowledge in rent, for example economy of effort for a given \nPage 29 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n28\nwage. Even where managers can monitor the labour process and extract some surplus, \nthe information asymmetry between them and their non-expert shareholders becomes \nall the larger, leaving shareholders with remote possibilities of surplus appropriation.\nThe amount of v required could be reduced in other ways, but these may be more \nimitable. For example, the length of the working day could be extended without a \ncommensurate increase in wages.  Supervisory and quality control circulation costs \ncould be reduced by having employees police their own behaviour, but self-policing is \nlikely to reduce the value captured from the labour process. \nFALLING RATES OF PROFIT\nWe have seen that, in an effort to reduce costs, living labour (v) is replaced by \"dead\" \nlabour (c) embodied in the means of production.  If the rate of exploitation (s\/v) \nremains constant, then the increasing organic composition of capital has the overall \neffect of causing the rate of profit to fall.  This is Marx's \u2018Law of the Tendency of the \nRate of Profit to Fall\u2019, an inherent tendency within the system that nevertheless can be \nmoderated by \"counteracting forces\".  From the perspective of RBV, this process of \nincreasing c\/v could be explained as follows.\nWe have seen how economies of scale and the creation of intermediate use \nvalues can all lead to an increase in the organic composition of capital c\/v. Ultimately \nthe process of proceduralising and de-skilling can result in the process being \nperformed by a machine. Here living labour LP is replaced first by LPd through \norganisational learning and knowledge co-production and then through deskilling LPd\nis transformed into LPh and MP is transformed into MPd (where LPh < LP). \nTransparency, achieved through management accounting and financial reporting, \nspeeds up the value capture process, but at the same time makes the changes more \nPage 30 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n29\neasily imitable by other firms. Moreover, with imitation across the industry the net \noutcome is an increase in the organic composition of capital in that industry, relative \nto other industries: c+\/v compared with c\/v for other spheres of production, where \nc+\uf03ec.  As surplus value can only be derived from the actions of living labour (v), if \nthere is no corresponding increase in the rate of surplus value in the industry (i.e. s\/v \nis average), then the rate of profit in this industry will decline: \nRate of Profit = \nvc\ns\n\uf02b\nIf we divide through by v, then: \nRate of Profit = \n1\uf02b\nv\nc\nv\ns\nAnd so, if c+\/v for a particular industry is greater than average c\/v, then the \nrate of profit in this industry will be lower than average, assuming no change in s\/v:\nv\nc\nv\nc \uf03e\n\uf02b\ntherefore the rate of profit in this industry is below average:\n(a) \n11 \uf02b\n\uf03c\n\uf02b\n\uf02b\nv\nc\nv\ns\nv\nc\nv\ns\nSo the replacement of living labour with machinery, de-skilling and the \ncreation of intermediate use values confers a temporary advantage on the firm that \ninnovates first.  But, if these moves are imitated the result is an increase in the organic \ncomposition of capital in the industry, relative to others, and hence a declining rate of \nprofit in this industry.  So the process of resource creation in these cases can lead to a \nPage 31 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n30\nshort-term advantage for the first mover, but the net effect of this process is to lower \nprofit rates across the industry as this ploy is imitated.\nTo summarize, if the resource augments constant capital e.g. scale efficient \nequipment, or intermediate use values, the resource-endowed firm is able to sell its \noutput above its value. If these resources then get imitated the result is that the value\nrate of profit in the industry declines as the amount of constant capital has increased \nwithout any commensurate increase in surplus value (inequality (a) above). So the \neffect of resources that are capitalized is that once they are imitated the average rate \nof profit in the industry declines.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this paper we have used insights from Marx's economics to inform RBV, and RBV \nin turn has enabled us to develop certain aspects of Marx's schema. We have seen that \nthe process of accumulation, which is at the heart of Marx's analysis and which we \nhave explored in the circuit of capital, is capable of representing and accounting for \nmany of the phenomena developed in the RBV. By introducing Marx\u2019s concept of \nvalue we have been able to explore the effects on firm\u2019s and industries of particular \ntypes of resource developments, how the value created from such developments is \nsplit between employees, managers and shareholders and how accounting mediates \nthe split, and the impact on industry profitability if these are imitated. \nDirect empirical testing of the relationships outlined is possible for example \nby using realised profit rates to ascertain the most efficient firm and hence the socially \nnecessary labour in any given industry sector. Moreover the categories used by Marx \nabove have been shown to be consistent with conventional accounting categories \n(Bryer, 2005). Profit rates can be mapped over time for firms and industries, and \nPage 32 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n31\napproximations to the value constructs c and v can be made using cost information. \nBut further theoretical work is needed to explore the effects of introducing market \ndynamics, rates of resource diffusion, and entry barriers into the theory. Finally, there \nis a macro perspective that could be developed to consider these processes and \ntendencies at a system level. Even so, it is hoped that this paper represents a \nradicalisation of strategy and will assist in the development of future discussions of \ncritical strategy as well as critical accounting.\nPage 33 of 38\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n32\nREFERENCES\nAmit, R. & Schoemaker, P.J.H. 1993.

This ambiguity is due to the interactions in the processes of value \ncreation between capital that can exist in a form separated from individual employees, \ne.g. a codified procedure, and human capital that is embodied in individuals. These \ninteractions are difficult to disentangle, and as a result it is not possible to clearly \nattribute the creation of value to the component parts of embedded capital\u2019.\nii Marx recognizes that only necessary labour time is relevant to the determination of \nthe value of a commodity. So, for example, just because I was a really slow worker \nand took twice as long as the average employee to make a chair, that chair would not \nbe worth twice as much.\n"}
