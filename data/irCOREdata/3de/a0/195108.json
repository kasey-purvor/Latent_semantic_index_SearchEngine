First, to introduce this largely unknown aspect of Elias\u2019s work to a \nwider audience.

During the early \nstages of the research, Elias suggested that the transition from school to work \nconstituted a \u2018shock\u2019 experience and that young people would experience initial \ndifficulties in adjusting to their new role. He suggested that difficulties would emerge \nin their relationships with older workers, with family and with their new income. For \nthe first time this paper presents Elias\u2019s \u2018shock\u2019 hypothesis, and his thoughts on \nschool to work transitions. The paper concludes by reflecting on the value of the \nshock hypothesis and the possible impact that the Adjustment of Young Workers to \nWork Situations and Adult Roles project may have on Elias standing in British \nsociology. \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \nIn the early 1960s Elias also successfully applied for a major research \ngrant\u2026to investigate school leavers\u2019 adjustment to working life. The \nresults of this \u2018Young Worker Project\u2019 eventually appeared in \npublications by colleagues at Leicester, not by Elias himself (Mennell \n1992: 21-22). \nForty years ago, in 1962, fieldwork began on the research project \u2018Adjustment of \nYoung Workers to Work Situations and Adult Roles\u2019 (commonly know as the Young \nWorker Project). Led by Norbert Elias, this was an interview-based survey of the \nschool to work transition experiences of nearly nine hundred young adults in \nLeicester, UK. The Department for Scientific and Industrial Research awarded the \nproject \u00a315,081 for three years beginning in April 1962. The research was based on \nElias\u2019s assertion that the transition from school to work constituted a \u2018shock\u2019 \nexperience and that young people would experience real difficulties in adjusting to \ntheir new role as adults and workers. Suggesting that much of the early research on \nyoung people was essentially \u2018adult centred\u2019 and based on the experiences and \nperspectives of adults rather than the young people themselves, Elias argued that his \napproach would be radically different from other studies of the time as \u2018adult \ninvestigators are apt to investigate either their own problems with regard to young \npeople\u2026not problems which confront, and which are experienced by the young \ngeneration itself\u2019 (Elias 1962a: 1). Instead Elias wrote that this project would be  \n\u2026concerned with the problems which young male and female workers \nencounter during their adjustment to their work situation and their \nentry into the world of adults. When they go to work, or begin to train \nfor work, young workers have to make a wider adjustment to a \nsituation and to roles which are new to them, whose implications are \noften imperfectly understood by them and by the adults concerned, and \nfor which they are in many cases not too well prepared. (Young \nWorker Project, 1962b: 2) \nThis broad position was then translated into five specific areas of enquiry \u2013 \nadjustment to relationships with older workers and supervisors; adjustment to job \nproblems; adjustment to role as workers; adjustment to role as \u2018money-earner\u2019 in \nhome relations; and adjustment to role as \u2018money-earner\u2019 in leisure time. Initially the \nidea was for the data to be collected via interviews, informal discussions, case studies \nand participant observation, however only interviews were used. The interview \nschedule was semi-structured with a mixture of open and closed questions. The \nschedule contained 82 questions organised in five sections - Work, Family and \nExpenditure, Leisure, School and Work, and General. The interviewers were asked to \nwrite all answers to questions verbatim if possible and always in as full detail as the \n 3 \ntime and circumstances allowed. The sample of young adults was drawn from the \nYouth Employment Office index of all Leicester school leavers from the summer and \nChristmas of 1960 and the summer and Christmas of 1962. At the end of the \nfieldwork in 1964, 882 interviews, plus a pilot survey of 28 interviews had been \ncompleted.  \nHowever, at the start of the research in 1962, the researchers involved with the \nproject were unaware that Elias had arranged to take up a Chair in Sociology at the \nUniversity of Ghana from the October of that year. Although Elias attempted to direct \nthe project remotely via a research committee, problems with working practice \nemerged, the Research Officers[1] on the project resigned and other members of staff \ndistanced themselves from the research. The project then became characterised by \nacrimony, distrust and feelings of failure, and entered the \u2018Leicester air\u2019 as something \nnever to be referred to again. With the exceptions of Keil et al (1963b), Ashton \n(1973, 1974) and Ashton and Field (1976) in which a sample of the cases and \nbackground literature were used, and despite being one of the largest government \nsponsored projects on young workers of the time, the data from this project has \nremained unanalysed and unexplored for forty years.  \nIn 2000 nearly nine hundred of the original interview schedules and some background \nmaterials were recovered from where they were archived in the mid 1970s. Using this \nmaterial and other archive documents, it is possible, for the first time, to examine \nElias\u2019s thoughts on school to work transitions and explore his \u2018shock\u2019 hypothesis in \nmore detail. As such, the remainder of the paper will be structured as follows. First, \nthe possible reasons as to why this Elias project has remained unexplored are \nconsidered. The discussion then moves on to a consideration of Elias\u2019s shock \nhypothesis. This will be done by using his writings, minutes of meetings and \ncorrespondence relating to the Young Worker Project. In order to explore and \nunderstand Elias\u2019s approach and ideas on shock, the intention is to set this discussion \nin the context of some of his other writings.  \nIgnored or Lost ? Elias and Youth Transitions to Work Situations \nElias\u2019s work has been considered in detail (Mennell 1992; Hughes 1998; Van \nKrieken 1998; Smith 2000) and there have been those who have taken Elias\u2019s ideas \nand applied them to a broad range of concerns and areas of enquiry (Dunning 1981, \n1999; Van Krieken 1989, 1999; Hughes 1997; Fletcher 1997; Tabboni 2001). The \nbroad range of applications of Elias\u2019s work reflects Elias\u2019s own concern to explore \nthe breadth of social phenomenon in order to demonstrate that a long term, dynamic \n(rather than static) framework offers a better understanding and leads to a more \n 4 \nadequate enquiry. According to authors such as Mennell (1992) and Van Krieken \n(1998) (and even Elias (1970) himself) Elias was unique, given the increasing \ndivision of labour amongst sociologists, in that he wrote across so many substantive \nareas and the value of his work is its interconnectedness (Mennell 1992: 279-280).  \nAs such Elias\u2019s interest in youth transitions to work and adulthood is not surprising. \nWhat is surprising, however, is that no one has engaged directly with, or explored \nfully, Elias\u2019s interest in youth transitions or his foray into the arena of large-scale \ngovernment funded research in this area. This despite Szakolczai\u2019s (2000) assertion \nthat the main aspects of Elias\u2019s life and work are well researched and well known. \nThe Young Worker Project has received scant attention within the existing literature \non Elias and remains largely unknown outside the University of Leicester or beyond \nthose fully familiar with every aspect of Elias\u2019s life and work. Indeed most \nintroductions to Elias do not mention this research at all (see Fletcher 1997; Van \nKrieken 1998; Hughes 1998; Korte 2001) nor does Elias mention the project in his \nautobiographical writings (Elias 1994). The exception to this is Mennell (1992) in \nwhich the young worker project receives the very briefest of mentions. Whilst this is \na tantalising reference, Mennell (1992) does not explore the reasons why Elias did not \npublish the findings himself nor does Mennell provide any additional detail on this \n\u2018major\u2019 research grant obtained by Elias.  \nOne possible reason why this project may have received little attention in the Elias \nliterature is that it may have been perceived by later scholars as a \u2018Departmental\u2019 \nproject and not really part of Elias\u2019s body of work. Indeed, Elias referred to the \nproject as a \u2018Departmental\u2019 project and the early minutes of meetings identify it as \nsuch. Likewise the management and \u2018staffing\u2019 of the project in the early phases of \nresearch involved a number of members of the Sociology Department at Leicester \nincluding Ilya Neustadt, Sheila Williams (now Allen), Percy Cohen, Richard Brown \nand Anthony Giddens. However, there are a number of problems with this view. In \nthe correspondence from DSIR Elias is clearly identified as the primary grant holder \n(see letter from Albert Cherns to Elias 12 November 1965). From the surviving \nbackground documents it is clear that Elias was fully involved in the development of \nthe proposal, wrote a number of memoranda on the aims and focus of the project and \ncommented on the design of the research instrument. Elias insisted that his view and \nhis approach to the research be adhered to otherwise he would resign from the \nresearch project (Elias 1963). Elias was involved in the appointment of the original \nresearch team and the appointment of those who were later appointed to try and \nrevive the project. Elias attended numerous meetings on the project before he left for \nthe University of Ghana, and during his vacations from Ghana. Whilst in Ghana, \nElias corresponded regularly about the research with Neustadt, and the other members \n 5 \nof the team. In Neustadt\u2019s correspondence with Elias regarding the project, Neustadt \nsought and always deferred to Elias\u2019s views in relation to the research despite the fact \nthat Neustadt was the Head of Department at the time (see Neustadt 1964a). In the \nfinal stages of the research it was to Elias that the original research team wrote, \nexplaining their reasons for resigning from the project. Finally, Elias expressed, and \neventually got, his wish to return to Leicester as a Senior Research Fellow and to \nsupervise the Young Worker Project (see Neustadt 1964a). The archived material \nclearly indicates that Elias maintained his interest in young people\u2019s adjustment to \nwork from the early 1960s to the mid 1970s and hoped that something would \neventually happen to the data collected from the Young Worker project over a decade \nearlier.  \nHowever, an additional reason that may have discouraged a fuller discussion of this \nproject is the problematic and difficult circumstances that surrounded the end of the \ndata collection in 1964. As Brown (1987) suggests \nSomeone who had thought so long and to such good effect about \nsociological problems as he had could find it difficult to understand \nwhy others did not see things as he did, or to take on board ideas and \npoints of view different from his own. There was in my experience one \nmajor disagreement about the conduct of a research project which \nproved quite damaging to all concerned and to the progress of the \nresearch (Brown, 1987: 538). \nSome of the problems surrounding this project, and the reasons for the resignation of \nthe original Research Officers have been reflected on elsewhere but have never been \npublished[2]. Beyond Elias\u2019s remoteness in Ghana and the acknowledged difficulties \nin communication[3], there were three main areas of disagreement between Elias and \nthe research team, including an ongoing argument over the researchers\u2019 rights to \npublish. Despite the Research Officers\u2019 eagerness to publish the results from the \nresearch, the research team felt that Elias had vetoed the publication of an article they \nhad written. Elias (and Ilya Neustadt) instructed that there should be no publications \nor interim reports based on the data. The following exchanges took place towards the \nend of the fieldwork: \nWe are very disappointed that you, and Ilya, intend to concentrate on \npreparing a final report rather that to publish, in addition, interim \narticles on specific aspects which would not be fully dealt with in the \none report\u2026We feel that unless it is the policy that we are free to \nsubmit such articles for publication after constructive criticism, the \nsituation is unacceptable. (Keil and Riddell 1964: 1) \nMy dear Teresa and David, you seem to think that I am a jealous man \nwho wants to prevent you from publishing anything independently of \n 6 \nme. I assure you nothing can be further from my mind\u2026If you care to \ntake up some specific part issue of the Young Worker Project and \npublish an article on it under your own name I have not the slightest \nobjection. But is quite a different matter if you wish to publish an \ninterim report on the whole project\u2026If you are concerned for your \nfuture career, realistically speaking, I think nothing could be better for \nyou than a really impressive final report on the Young Worker Project \nin which, you need not doubt, all due credit will be given for what you \nhave done. (Elias 1964a: 1-2) \nA second area for disagreement, and perhaps the main area of complication, was an \nongoing debate between Elias and the Research Officers as to the nature of the \ntheoretical framework and the composition of the sample. From the outset of the \nresearch, Elias was keen to capture the initial experiences of young people entering \nthe workplace as he felt that the young people\u2019s experience prior to work would not \nprepare then for what was to come. However, according to Elias, the Researcher \nOfficers had interpreted the early discussions to mean that this research was to be a \nstudy of \u2018work\u2019 per se. They identified their problem as \n \u2026given such a number of young people from known schools, home \nbackgrounds, and work situations, what is their experience when they \nbecome workers ?\u2026[We] do not think we should be content with \nknowing that they have difficulties and to what extent\u2026but wish to \ndistinguish certain factors which make for certain types of experience \nin the work situation. (Keil et al 1963a: 2) \nElias argued that the study should not be about work but instead the \u2018work situation\u2019 \nas many of the problems faced by young people rarely sprang from work in isolation \nof other situations. For Elias this came much closer to offering a better understanding \nof the problems faced by young workers than could be offered by a study of \u2018work\u2019. \nAs for the research problem of the Research Officers, Elias suggested that their \napproach was simply trying to look for causal relationships between the different \naspects of the sample. Elias felt that such an approach was far too conventional and \nignored the relationships and processes that surround the work situation that \nconstitute the young workers experience. In response to their initial theoretical \nproblem, Elias suggested that their working hypothesis  \n\u2026is even worse. It is based on the idea\u2026that men\u2019s [sic] attitudes and \nbehaviour are the passive effects of a social environment here \nrepresented by A, B and C. It has been by now fairly widely accepted \nthat this type of billiard ball causality: Billiard ball B (behaviour and \nattitudes) in its course determined by the movement of Billiard ball A \n(Features of the background\u2026features of the work situation, labour \nmarket), does not provide a very suitable model of thinking in relation \nto what one actually observes. I would suggest that the Research \n 7 \nOfficers think of the experiences of the young workers\u2026[and] that \nthey cease to think in wishy-washy terms like \u2018Background\u2019 or \n\u2018Features of the Background\u2019 and learn to think in situations as wholes, \nin configurations\u2026(Elias, 1963: 7) \nAccording to Elias (1963), the differences in the understanding of his ideas and \nconcepts, contained within the original grant application, meant that the researchers \nwere undertaking a different project to that originally proposed by him. The ongoing \nmisunderstandings over research direction, and Elias\u2019s constant suggestion that the \nresearchers lacked even a basic understanding of what the research was about, led the \nresearchers to perceive that Elias had no real confidence in them or their ability. \nThere were similar differences of opinion about the composition of the sample. \nDiscussions as to the exact composition of the sample took place throughout 1962 \nand culminated with the agreement that the investigation would be restricted to all \nthose working in Leicester who had worked for less than one year. It was also agreed \nthat the sample would be further stratified into four occupational categories or skill \nlevels \u2013 unskilled, semi-skilled, skilled and clerical. However, it was as suggested by \nthe Research Officers and Brown et al (1963) that limiting the sample to those who \nhad less than one years experience of work would reduce the possibility of exploring \nthe shock hypothesis that Elias intended. They argued that the younger members of \nthe sample had hardly had time to get over the excitement at not having to adhere to \nthe rigid discipline of school and earning money to experience the \u2018shock\u2019 that Elias \nrefers to (Brown et al 1963). Keil and Riddell (1963a) also expressed their concerns \nthat the sample should not be stratified in terms of skill level as they had doubts as to \nhow accurately the Youth Employment Service had recorded this information.  \n \nA third area for disagreement related to boarder methodological debates and stem \nfrom the coming together of two very different traditions. The two research officers \nKeil and Riddell came from the British tradition of empirical sociology with its \nemphasis on survey research and were recruited having previously worked on other \nlarge-scale quantitative research projects elsewhere. Teresa Keil came from the \nUniversity of Liverpool having worked with Joseph Banks on a study exploring the \nimpact of technological change and David Riddell came from the Scottish Social \nSurvey based at the University of St Andrews. Bryan Green, one of the research \nassistants was also experienced in market research interviewing. Elias came from a \nsociological tradition that was profoundly at odds with the abstract empiricism that \nwas characteristic of social scientific research in Britain and America at that time. \n 8 \nThe approach of the two different traditions can be contrasted very clearly. For \nexample, in the early 1970s Elias was interviewed about the Young Worker project \nby Jennifer Platt for her book Realities of Social Research (1976)[4]. In the interview \nElias suggested that through the Young Worker Project he hoped to be able to \ndemonstrate that statistical enquiry could also be undertaken within a dynamic \nframework and that it is only when the data is generated and analysed that the \nshortcomings of the survey can be seen. Based on these shortcoming one then can \nundertake a revised and improved investigation. Elias also suggested that he felt that \nthe researchers did not believe his assertions that it was possible to develop a precise \nand straightforward questionnaire that could also access or get at the \u2018experiential \nside\u2019 and explore the young workers experiences. Elias desire to use the data \ngenerated form the survey to identify further studies was translated to the research \nofficers as the need to undertake additional \u2018case studies\u2019. However, the research \nofficers received the apparent need for case studies very critically. As Keil (1964) \nsuggests \n\u2026every meeting with you has ended in your saying that we cannot \nunderstand your ideas, that we are too concerned with numbers and \nstatistics, too pedestrian, too inhibited by our training. I have thought a \ngreat deal about the source of such lack of mutual understanding and it \nseems to me to lie in a fundamental disagreement about the scope and \nlimits of large-scale research which ahs resulted in such turmoil and \nacrimony over the Young Worker project. (Keil 1964: 1) \n \nKeil (1964) goes on to suggest that she felt the Young Worker project was a real \nopportunity to undertake a large survey that would provide systematic information \nabout the experiences of young people entering work for the first time. For Keil the \nvalue of the data resides within the fact that the survey was based on a large, properly \nconstructed sample and a questionnaire designed to obtain factual information. She \ngoes on  \nWhy else is there a need to interview 1,000+ young people if one is \nonly concerned, in fact, with the experiences of 20 or 30 young people \nwho are somehow \u2018significant\u2019?\u2026 For me a large-scale survey is not a \nsimple multiplication of a small one, but an opportunity to test certain \nhypotheses which cannot be tackled otherwise. (Keil 1964: 1) \n \n 9 \nFor Elias the value of the study did not ultimately reside in the ability to produce \nstatistically significant quantitative results in the ability to explore the transition to \nwork as the young people experienced and accounted for it themselves.  \nWhatever the reasons for the obscurity of this major area of research within the body \nof work by, or about Elias, it is clear that Elias was sufficiently involved with the \nproject and his ideas determined the direction of the research to warrant a fuller \nexposition.  \n \nElias and the \u2018Shock Hypothesis\u2019 \nAs suggested above Elias\u2019s contributions to the Young Worker Project have received \nscant attention, and as such, the only really full source of documentary evidence on \nthe project is in the archived collection of Elias papers at the Deutsches \nLiteraturarchiv, Marbach, Germany. Additionally, some of the original research team \nhad retained copies of their young worker documents including minutes of meetings, \ncorrespondence with Elias and memoranda. Together, papers from the archive and \nfrom the original research team provide some insight into the project and highlight \nmuch of Elias\u2019s \u2018transition as shock\u2019 hypothesis. However, using material from \nsources such as this does have potential problems. For example, there are obvious \ndifficulties in the piecing together of different aspects of an approach from such \nsecondary sources and this could lead to an imperfect understanding. Likewise \nproblems emerge in that one did not observe first hand the interactions or discussions \nthat took place regarding Elias\u2019s original approach. As such it is difficult to see the \nfull genesis of the ideas or how they were shaped via the discussion that took place. \nQuestions must also be raised about the extent to which these documents accurately \nrecord the discussions that took place and about selectivity in terms of what archive \nmaterial was retained and what was discarded. \nYet despite these concerns, piecing together Elias\u2019s original thoughts on this research \nand his shock hypothesis remains a worthy task as it adds a further dimension to \nElias\u2019s own writings and illustrates some of the themes Elias dealt with elsewhere in \nhis work. In doing so the use of the archive materials outlined above is inevitable as \nthis is all that survives in terms of the project. Remarkably, the archive documents do \nindicate a consistency in Elias\u2019s thoughts regardless of whether they are recorded in \nminutes, correspondence or memoranda and from these archive materials it is clear \nthat Elias identified eight specific problems to the experience of transition as a one of \nshock. They were \n 10 \n\u2022 The prolonged separation of young people from adults;  \n\u2022 The indirect knowledge of the adult world;  \n\u2022 The lack of communication between adults and children; \n\u2022 The social life of children in the midst of an adult world with limited \ncommunication between the two; \n\u2022 The role of fantasy elements in the social and personal life of the young \nvis-\u00e0-vis the reality of adult life; \n\u2022 The social role of young people is ill-defined and ambiguous;  \n\u2022 Striving for independence through earning money constitutes a new \nsocial dependence (on work rather than parents) \n\u2022 The prolonging of social childhood beyond biological maturity. \nAlthough each of these issues is interesting it would be impossible here to provide a \nfull exposition of each factor. As such, in the discussion that follows, we have given \nparticular attention to the role of indirect knowledge of the adult world and role \nfantasy versus the reality of adult life in the shock experience.  \nThe Civilising of Children: The Separation from Adults and the Role of Fantasy \n\u2026 I want to say that \u201cculture shock\u2019 is in my view a very inappropriate \nterm for what we are getting at. It runs smoothly from the lips, that is \nquite true, it sounds nice. But we are not trying to find out about a \nshock which \u201cculture\u201d gives to people. It is the work, the occupation, \nthe whole undreamed of reality of the adult world which is responsible \nfor the stresses of adolescents in that situation\u2026I have always \npreferred the term \u201cshock-experience\u201d, to the term \u201cshock\u201d. The most \nprecise expression of which I can think at the moment is probably \n\u201creality shock\u201d. That is, in fact, what it is likely to be. (Elias 1962, p.1) \nGiven the interrelationship between sociogenesis and psychogenesis, Elias argued \nthat the socialisation of children cannot take place behind closed doors and the \nlearning of adult behaviours is only possibly due to the presence of others. In 1980, \nElias reflected on the socialisation of children and the changing relationship between \nchildren and their parents in his lecture The Civilizing of Parents (Elias 1980; \nGoudsblom and Mennell 1998). In this work Elias suggested that child from early in \nlife, and through adolescence, is subject to an individual civilising process that shapes \ntheir behaviour, and in turn emerge high degrees of self-restraint and foresight in line \nwith the prevalent standards of behaviour at that time. As Van Krieken (1998) argues, \n 11 \nfor Elias childhood is the \u2018main \u2018transmission belt\u2019 for the development of the \nhabitus\u2019 (Van Krieken 1998; 156) of a given society \nHuman social life in the form of urban-industrial nation-states encloses \neach individual person in a complex network of longer more \ndifferentiated chains of interdependence. In order to claim to be an \nadult\u2026in order to fulfil an adults functions\u2026it is necessary to have a \nvery high degree of foresight, restraint of momentary impulses, for the \nsake of long-term goals and gratifications\u2026it requires a high degree of \nself-regulating restraint of drives and affects (Elias 1980: 201-202) \nChildren have to learn the self-control of drives and affects through the course of \nrelations with other people and \u2018according to the pattern and extent of socially given \ndrive and affect regulation\u2019 (Elias 1980: 202). The more complex a society the more \ncomplex this process of transition to adulthood or the learning of adult norms \nbecomes. According to Elias, the more complex a society, the more differentiated the \nsocial functions are and the more interdependent people become. In such a society, to \nfulfil the social functions, more foresight is required in order to subordinate \n\u2018momentary inclinations to the overriding necessities of interdependence\u2019 (Elias \n2000: 380; Mennell 1992: 96). For example, if one takes the social function of work, \nin a complex industrial society such as ours, the structure of drives and affects \nrequired for this adult behaviour is further from the behaviour of children than that \nrequired in simpler societies. To illustrate this Elias (1980) suggests that in Eskimo \nsociety there is a direct developmental line between children\u2019s play behaviour \n(playing with bows and arrows or learning to treat skins) and adult behaviour\u2019s of \nhunting, tent making and survival (Elias 1980: 202). The child\u2019s or young person\u2019s \nbehaviour corresponds to a high degree with adult reality whereas in complex \nindustrial societies it does not. As such, in a simpler society, Elias (1980) argues the \nindividual civilising transformation is temporally shorter and less deep-rooted (Elias \n1980: 202). \nA dimension of adult behaviour that children had to learn through their transition to \nadulthood was the difference between fantasy and reality. Like other aspects of \nknowledge and behaviour, the difference between fantasy and reality depends on \nprevalent standards at that time (i.e. it varies historically and between societies). For \nexample, Mennell (1992) suggests that in industrial complex societies there is a very \nclear division between fantasy and reality and people have to behave accordingly, if \nthey act out their dreams in a way that conflicts with prevalent standards their sanity \nwill be questioned (Mennell 1992: 162). In the Young Worker Project Elias wanted to \nexamine how young people experiencing the transition from school to work and \n 12 \nacquired and adjusted to the prevalent adult standards or norms of behaviour. Elias \n(1961) suggested that for young people \n\u2026their entry into work places young workers into a different position \nnot only in relation to parents or to friends, but in relation to adults \nwho are strangers \u2013 adult workers, supervisors, managers etc on whom \nthey depend\u2026The norms, the behaviour and attitudes of the adults \nwith which they now come into contact often differ considerably from \nthose with which they are familiar in their own family circle or from \ntheir contact with masters at school.(Elias 1961: 1) \nFor Elias, the norms, and attitudes or new codes of behaviour exhibited by the adults \nin the workplace involved problems of competition and co-operation, conforming and \nnon-conforming in factories and workshops and coping with tensions in social \nrelations (Elias, 1961: 1). The transition process and the adjustment to working life \nvia the learning of adult norms, for Elias, was not a simple process. The difficulty \narose in that the norms, the behaviour and attitudes of adults in the workplace \ndiffered considerably to those adults the young people were familiar with. In these \n\u2018already known\u2019 relationships the position of the young person is clearer as a \nsubordinate to the adult figure. For example a child is subordinate to their parents and \na  \u2018teenager\u2019 is in a subordinate role to their teacher. Through the processes of \nsociogenesis and psychogenesis over time a power ratio has emerged in these \nrelationships, which supports the young person\u2019s subordination. In turn the young \nperson displays appropriate behaviour. However, in our current society, when the \nyoung person begins to make the transition to work and adulthood their role becomes \nless clear. This, he argues, is due to the limited amount of contact between young \npeople and adults over and above family, friends and teachers. For example, at a \nmeeting of the young worker project team it was argued that \nThe central problem arises from the fact that a complex society such as \nours requires customarily a prolonged period of indirect preparation \nand training for adult life. By indirect I mean from the age of 5 to 14,15 \nor 16, the growing up children of our society are trained for their adult \ntasks in special institutions which we call schools, where they learn, \nwhere they acquire the knowledge about the adult world past, present \nand future not by direct contact with it, but largely from books. Their \nactual knowledge of the adult world, their only contacts with adults, \nare relatively limited. (Young Worker Project, 1962a: 2) \nElias suggested that this is radically different from the children growing up in \n\u2018simpler\u2019 European societies of previous periods in which children and young people \nhad more direct contact with adults. In our current society problems or difficulties can \narise in the adjustment to adult and work roles as the young workers are now neither \nfully adult nor fully children and they experience contact with different adults and \n 13 \ndifferent norms of adult behaviour. As such, Elias suggested that this research begin \nwith the hypothesis that \n\u2026nothing, or very little, that the school leaver has been taught has \nprepared him or her for the experience of starting work; that the \nexperience was a \u201cshock\u201d experience. (Young Worker Project, 1962b: \n2) \nElias\u2019s notion of shock is reinforced with comments made at the fifth meeting of \nyoung worker project team. Here Elias quoted an example of the shock experienced \nby a young worker at being told not to work too hard. The minutes suggest that Elias \nargued that the problem could be approached without first needing to find out the \nadult norm of not working too hard, instead the emphasis should be on \u2018what the \nyoung workers are faced with, as they see it and describe it in talking about their first \nfew weeks in the factory\u2019 (Young Worker Project, 1962b: 2). Elias wanted to \nunderstand how the young people experienced the norm of not working too hard. For \nexample, it could be argued that shock emerges in that the young adults have moved \nfrom a situation where adults, in the form of teachers at school, have instructed the \nyoung adults to work hard and have administered punishments to those who did not, \nto a situation where unfamiliar adults are instructing, advising and encouraging the \nyoung people to behave in a way that was previously discouraged. The existence of \nthe young worker is threatened by the fact that their social world changes and they \ncome into contact with behaviours and norms that are totally unfamiliar to them. To \nfurther illustrate this idea, in meetings and in various memoranda, Elias reflects on \nthe role of money in the transition process. For Elias, one of the main areas of \ntransition to work that required the young worker to learn new behaviours and norms \nwas in the acquisition and management of money. The process of having one\u2019s own \nmoney and having to work in exchange for this money, represented for Elias a further \nchange in the social reality of the young worker. He suggested that the young people \nmade the transition from a \n\u2026situation in which money, and food and clothing are given, and \nreceived as a right, without anything being given by the child in \nexchange, to a situation in which money is only given in exchange for \nwork by the receiver. (Young Worker Project, 1962c: 1) \nThese changes to the social reality of the young worker, experienced as part of the \ntransition from school to work, according to Elias caused anxiety or shock. These \nassertions by Elias build on points made in The Civilising Process. \nAny other behaviour, any breach of the prohibitions or restraints \nprevailing in their society means danger\u2026And the peculiarly \nemotional undertone so often associated with moral demands\u2026reflects \n 14 \nthe danger in which any breach of the prohibitions places the unstable \nbalance of all those for whom the standard behaviour of society has \nbecome more or less \u2018second nature\u2019. These attitudes are symptoms of \nthe anxiety aroused in adults when the structure of their own drives, \nand with it their own social existence and the social order in which it is \nanchored is even remotely threatened. (Elias 2000: 141). \nElias argued that the transition from childhood to adulthood, from school to work is \none of the great anxiety arousing transitions as the young person\u2019s social existence \nand social order are threatened. In previous societies, according to Elias, ceremonies \nor \u2018rites of passage\u2019 grew up around the transitions between social roles to help ease \nthe anxiety. Indeed, Elias suggests that all situations, which were liable to arouse fear \nor anxiety, such as the transition from one socio-biological state to another, were \nmarked by public ceremonies as means of helping the individual contain their fears \nand anxieties. However Elias suggests that the \u2018communal ceremonies of passage \nformerly attached to the transition from childhood to adulthood have completely \nlapsed\u2019 (Elias 1962a: 2). \nFor Elias, a further contributing factor to the \u2018shock experience\u2019, part of the transition \nfrom school to work and adulthood, was the degree of difference between fantasy and \nreality held by the child versus the reality of the adult world. Indeed Elias (1962) \nsuggests \nSomehow the experience of many youngsters when they grow up in \nour society seem to me similar. They perceive more the wider choices \nof adulthood than its restraints and frustrations. (Elias 1962, p.2) \nAs part of acquiring the prevalent adult standards or norms of behaviour in the work \nplace, the young workers had to also learn the prevalent standards in the differences \nbetween fantasy and reality at that time. For Elias, the gap between childhood and \nadolescent dreams and their adult reality is great and, given the absence of \nrelationships between children and other adults (and the adult world), Elias suggested \nthat children have developed fantasies about their future adult role. Children have to \ndevelop fantasies about their future adult role as they have not experienced it nor do \nthey have much contact (before they enter work) with adults who have. Elias (1962) \ngoes on \nBefore they enter their job, adolescents have a highly selective and still \nrather unrealistic perception of the adult world and of their life in it. \nThe encounter with reality enforces a reorganisation of their \nperception. This is a painful process for at least two different reasons. \nFirst, because every strongly enforced reorganisation of perceptions is \npainful. Second, to all intents and purposes the \u201csocial reality\u201d to \nwhich the youngsters have to get used, is unsatisfactory and the gap \n 15 \nbetween the adult reality as it turns out to be is very great indeed. This \nis the objective situation\u2026We are after the actual experiences to which \nit gives rise\u2026\u201cshock-experience\u201d or \u201creality-shock\u201d understood as \nsomething which may have a variety of forms, which may sometimes \nbe sudden and biting and sometimes slowly coming over the years \nending in a final shock of recognition that there will never be anything \nelse but that, seems to me our best bet. (Elias 1962, p.1) \nFor Elias, given the absence of relationships between children and other adults, the \ndifferences between the fantasies of future adult roles and the actual reality of adult \nlife, and the encounter with reality, which enforces a reorganisation of perceptions \nduring the transition from school to work, all lead to this experience being one of \nshock. An example of this could be that the young person before entering work, has a \nperception or fantasy that work will be a positive experience and will have no \nnegative effect on them. In such a fantasy the young person does not perceive the \nreality of adult working life as being one without long school holidays, short working \ndays and extended \u2018break times\u2019. The reality of work is different from the perceptions \nof the young person and, for Elias, the realisation that nothing will ever be the same \nin terms of school holidays or the general loss of the \u2018freedoms\u2019 that accompany \nchildhood lead the young person to experience a \u2018reality-shock\u2019. Interestingly, Elias \nsuggested that the reality shock was greater for girls as they have had a less \u2018realistic\u2019 \nupbringing as compared to boys. \nIn an unpublished memo (Elias 1964b) Elias further clarified his thoughts on shock \nand suggested that it was possible to classify each \u2018interview\u2019 in terms of a particular \n\u2018reality types\u2019. One of the reality types Elias suggested could be the \u2018types of \nrelationship between expectation and reality\u2019. Elias argued that there were three main \npossibilities that the young workers would experience. First, that expectations of the \njob would be more or less like school but the reality was that work was indeed very \ndifferent. For example, the supervisors at work were not like teachers and, whereas at \nschool it was possible to \u2018mess about\u2019 (or act in ways not approved of by adults) \nwhen not directly supervised, at work it was not possible to \u2018mess about\u2019 at all . \nSecond, the expectation that work will be terrible and the reality was that work was \nnot as bad as expected. For example, that work would be hard and the young person \nwould be made to work like slaves, whereas the reality was different with less control \nof the young person and great possibilities for controlling the pace of work. Finally, \nthe expectation that the freedom from school would be \u2018marvellous\u2019 but the reality of \nwork and adult life were less \u2018marvellous\u2019 than expected. Leaving school would be \nalmost like an escape from the prison-like or controlled realities of education. \nHowever, on escaping the young person finds that work is also controlled and \nprovides little opportunity for the individual expression they so desire.  \n 16 \n \nConclusions \nThis paper began with two main aims - to introduce this largely unknown aspect of \nElias\u2019s work to a wider audience beyond the few who were aware of the projects \nexistence and, second, to piece together Elias\u2019s shock hypotheses from archived \nmaterials. It is clear from the above discussion that the Young Worker Project \nrepresented a major undertaking by Elias and is the only example of Elias \ninvolvement in large-scale publicly funded survey research. It is also clear that by \nproposing the shock-hypothesis Elias was trying to further elaborate on, and further \nexplore, ideas presented in The Civilising Process and other works. However, based \non the discussion there are two final points that we would like to make to conclude \nthis paper. The first of these deals with the shock hypothesis and the second with \nElias\u2019s legacy in British Sociology.  \nAlthough the shock hypothesis builds upon Elias\u2019s other work, this hypothesis has \nfound little support within the literature of youth transitions. Even Elias\u2019s own \nresearch team questioned the hypothesis are argued that there was little evidence of \nshock to be found in the data. For example, using data from the pilot study Brown et \nal (1963) suggested that the younger members of the sample had hardly had time to \nget over the excitement at not having to adhere to the rigid discipline of school and \nearning money to experience the \u2018shock\u2019 that Elias refers to. \nOur examination of the previous work shows it to be an almost \nuniversal finding from actual investigations that, at the time of entry to \nwork for young people, the excitement of leaving school and earning a \nwage over- shadows other feelings, to a large extent. These preliminary \nattitudes reduce the impact of experiences of work and life as workers, \nfor a time. (Brown et al, 1963: 1). \nLikewise, Ashton and Field (1976) also argued that most young people did not \nexperience severe problems of adjustment during the transition from school to work. \nThey suggest that the view that young people experience shock due to the fact they \nare isolated from work in educational establishments and suddenly released into work \nis erroneous and at best common sense. They argue that previous experiences at \nhome, school and amongst their peer groups actually prepares them well to fit in or \nadjust to the demands of starting work (Ashton and Field 1976: 12). There are other \ncriticisms of the shock hypothesis that can also be used to question legitimacy of this \napproach. For example, the actual origins of Elias\u2019s concern with the problems of \nadjustment and the adjustment as shock remain unclear and the lack of knowledge of \nwork highlighted by Elias as being significant, may actually more accurately reflect \n 17 \nthe experience of middle class youth as opposed to working class youth. Likewise the \ndata also indicates that many of the young workers had actually worked before they \nhad left school and had some understanding of what work entailed. However, despite \nthese criticisms, a reanalysis of the data emerging from the Young Worker Project \ndoes provide some empirical evidence for Elias\u2019s shock hypothesis as the following \nquotations from the interviewer notes reveal \nRespondent was the first case I have met of a real traumatic shock on entering \nwork. Her mother said that in her first job which only lasted a week she cried every \nnight, couldn\u2019t eat her food and couldn\u2019t sleep. She wasn\u2019t shown how to do \nanything, the people were snobbish, and she found it generally too much for her. It \nwas quite different at her second job, where, although she had criticism, she \nseemed to identify strongly with her office group. (D278) \nI think this R could qualify as one of Dr. Elias\u2019 \u201cYouth islanders\u201d, for she seems to \nlive in a two-thirds dream world. This consists of black leather coats, coffee bars, \nArt and Tech etc. She obviously yearns to be one of the college set and was proud \nof her affiliations to it\u2026Her ambitions - modelling, air hostess, own salon by 20 \nare all very out of track with reality. Perhaps her maturity has been put off partly as \na result of being an only child of rather old parents. (B605)  \nAn interesting character who seemed to typify Norbert Elias\u2019s \u201cCulture Shock\u201d. \nThis is to some extent and whose job choices seemed to be rather haphazardly and \nirrationally chose. Obviously a boy who disliked hard work and enjoyed the more \nthan occasional skive. (A620) \nIt is also the case that authors are beginning to explore some of the themes that Elias \nalluded to in his writings on the shock hypothesis. For example, Lawy and Bloomer \n(2003) reflect on the superficial understanding that the young people in their study \nhad of their own futures and the fact that the future occupational opportunities \nanticipated by the young people were not forthcoming. The difference between their \nperceived future opportunities (fantasy) and their actual experiences (reality) have \nconsequences for the young people\u2019s identify formation and transformation. \nLikewise, Elias\u2019s concern for understanding the problems that young people \nexperience in their adjustments in leaving school, becoming workers, entering \nunfamiliar situations for which they are unprepared, earning money, changing family \nrelations, and working with others beyond the close circle of school friends, has some \noverlap with the risk, uncertainty, insecurity and individualization debates which are \nso characteristic of the current literature on youth transitions. \n \nOur second conclusion relates to Elias\u2019s standing amongst British sociologists and, \nalthough speculative, is perhaps worthy of consideration. The significant role that \nNorbert Elias has played in the sociology department at the University of Leicester \nhas been highlighted by many (Kilminster 1987; Mennell 1992; Van Krieken 1998; \n 18 \nDunning 2002; Halsey 2004; Platt 2004) and it is clear that Elias has been an \nimportant influence on the careers of many who went through the Leicester \ndepartment in the 1950s and 1960s (Halsey 2004). However, despite his apparently \ncentral role, many have also questioned why Elias\u2019s ideas have not been well received \namongst many British sociologists until fairly recently (Kilminster 1987; Mennell \n1992; Van Krieken 1998; Dunning 2002). It has been suggested that Elias\u2019s \npreviously patchy impact on British sociology may have been due to the lack of \nEnglish translations, the dominance of Parsons in 1950s and 1960s sociology, his use \nof psychoanalysis, the increased specialisation amongst sociologists or even just a \ngeneral lack of awareness (Kilminster 1987; Mennell 1992). Whilst all of the points \nmay be true the Young Worker Project may provide an additional explanation. It is \nnot inconceivable that the way Elias developed, managed and implemented this \nproject may have had a negative effective on the reception of Elias in British \nsociology. We suggest this as many of the researchers originally involved in the \nYoung Worker Project went on to occupy senior roles within British sociology as \nprofessors, heads of departments or held senior positions within the British \nSociological Association (see Platt 2003). Regardless of the rights and wrongs of the \narguments that took place between Elias and the research team, the researchers felt \naggrieved and some still reflect on their experiences with some bitterness and regret. \nSuch experiences and feelings must have impacted on their presentation of Elias to \ntheir colleagues within British sociology. As Neustadt (1964b) alleges in a letter to \nElias \nThe research officers\u2026also created difficult and unpleasant situations \nhere by agitating in a most unpleasant and vengeful manner with all \nsorts of people in the University here and in various other places in the \ncountry. (Neustadt 1964b: 1) \n \nThe difficulties that have surrounded this project, and the sensitivities which still \nexist for some of the original research team, have meant this project remained \u2018lost\u2019 \nfor many years. However, it is documented in Elias\u2019s own correspondence, and within \nthe interview with Jennifer Platt he clearly felt regret for what had happened during \nthis research and that the project could not be saved. In a later letter to Jennifer Platt, \nElias suggested \u2018the fact that a questionnaire designed and interviews conducted \nunder the influence of divergent views cannot be salvaged by a later effort, was for \n 19 \nme a lesson which I shall not forget\u2019 (Elias, 1972a: 1-2). Such sentiments suggest that \na fuller consideration of this aspect of Elias\u2019s work is clearly merited and the re-\nanalysis of the data we have recovered more than worthwhile [5]. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis emerges from an ESRC project \u2018From Young Workers To Older Workers: \nReflections on Work in the Life Course\u2019 (R000223653).

They were supported by a research assistant, Colin Tipton (1962-1963) and \nBryan Green (1963-1964). \n \n[2] In the mid 1990s Sheila Allen, Richard Brown and Teresa Keil were asked to \nwrite a chapter for a book on their experiences of working with Norbert Elias, \nhowever this remains unpublished. \n \n[3] One of the communication problems was that Elias would often write to Ilya \nNeustadt rather than the research team. Neustadt would then have to interpret and \nrepresent Elias\u2019s wishes at the committee meetings. \n \n[4] It is interesting to note that for the Realities of Social Research book Platt \ninterviewed Elias and other members of the Young Worker Project team. However, \nwhere the Young Worker Project is discussed in the book it is the experiences and \naccounts of the other researchers, rather than Elias\u2019s views, that appear to have \ninformed Platt\u2019s analysis. \n \n[5] Data the from the Adjustment of Young Workers to Work Situations and Adult \nRoles project has been used for the first time as part of a new and wider project \u2018From \nYoung Workers To Older Workers: Reflections on Work in the Life Course\u2019 (ESRC \nR000223653). The overall aim of the project was to examine the process of \nadjustment to working life and retirement of a single cohort of male and female \nworkers over the four decades 1962\/3-2002\/3. This project will analyse the data from \nthe original project and then we aim to trace two hundred of the 854 original young \nworkers for re-interview. \n \nReferences \nAshton, D.N. and Field, D.
