Introduction\nIt has been observed in two-dimensional high-Reynolds-number \ufb02ows that\naxisymmetric coherent vortical structures arise spontaneously from random initial\nconditions (Fornberg 1977; McWilliams 1984). Many studies of these coherent\nstructures focus on the behaviour of an axisymmetric vortex under a non-axisymmetric\nperturbation, which could be weak or strong. These studies typically consider\nperturbations with an azimuthal wavenumber m=2 or higher. (For discussion of\nthe m=1 case and its peculiarities see Llewellyn Smith 1995.) Early studies of\nsuch vortices showed that they often return to an axisymmetric state. A vortex can\nrelax inviscidly to an axisymmetric state when the non-axisymmetric perturbation\nbecomes \ufb01nely scaled owing to the spiral wind-up in the underlying \ufb02ow (Melander,\nMcWilliams & Zabusky 1987). As the values of the perturbation vorticity do not\ntend to zero pointwise, a more convenient notion of axisymmetrization is when\nthe non-axisymmetric components of the streamfunction \u03c8 tend to zero for large\ntimes. For large but \ufb01nite Reynolds number R, the non-axisymmetric components of\nthe vorticity are destroyed, and hence the vortex axisymmetrizes, on the time scale\nO(R1\/3), which is fast compared to the slow viscous timescale of O(R) (Berno\ufb00 &\nLingevitch 1994; Bajer, Bassom & Gilbert 2001).\n382 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\n6\nt = 0 t = 300 t = 700\n(a)\ny\n\u20136\n6(b)\ny\n\u20136\n\u20136 6\nx\n\u20136 6\nx\n\u20136 6\nx\nFigure 1. Plot of the Gaussian vortex (a) and the tanh pro\ufb01le vortex (b), with \u03c3 = \u03c32 = 0.2,\nrelaxing to a tripole structure with R = 104 and \u03b4 = 0.5. Positive vorticity is shown as white,\nnegative vorticity is black and zero vorticity is grey; the peak vorticity values are saturated at\n|Z| = 0.005.\nAs more numerical and experimental studies were carried out, it became apparent\nthat axisymmetrization occurs only for su\ufb03ciently weak perturbation amplitudes, and\nthat for larger amplitudes, the vortex can evolve into a persistent non-axisymmetric\nstate (Dritschel 1989, 1998; Koumoutsakos 1997; Rossi, Lingevitch & Berno\ufb00 1997).\nAn example of a persistent nonlinear state is a multipole, which can be formed by\nallowing an initial vorticity distribution of the form\nZ(r, \u03b8) = Z0(r) + \u03b4Zm(r)e\nim\u03b8 + complex conjugate, (1.1)\nto evolve freely in time. The variables (r, \u03b8) are the usual polar coordinates and\nZm(r)e\nim\u03b8 is an m-fold perturbation to the axisymmetric monopole vortex Z0(r). The\nreal parameter \u03b4 > 0 is an amplitude and axisymmetrization occurs if \u03b4 is below a\nthreshold value. In the most studied case, the vorticity distributions take the form\nZ0(r) =\n1\n4\u03c0\ne\u2212r\n2\/4, Z2(r) =\nr2\n4\u03c0\ne\u2212r\n2\/4, (1.2)\nwith m=2. The vortex evolves into a tripole which consists of a vortex core with two\nopposite-signed satellites of vorticity rotating around it, if \u03b4 is above some threshold\nvalue (Rossi et al. 1997; Barba 2006; Barba & Leonard 2007). This tripole structure\ncan be seen in \ufb01gure 1(a), which shows the evolution of (1.1) and (1.2) with R =104\nand \u03b4=0.5 at t =0, t = 300 and t =700. Negative vorticity is black in the panels,\nand at t =700 we can see the two negative satellites rotating around a positive vortex\ncore.\nSuch tripoles can also emerge from instabilities within axisymmetric shielded\nmonopoles, that is, comprising a vortex core with a ring of opposite-signed vorticity\nencasing it and zero total circulation. This has led to many investigations of the\nevolution of a tripole from these shielded monopoles by experiments (van Heijst,\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two-dimensional vortices 383\nKloosterziel & Williams 1991) and numerical studies (Carton & Legras 1994; Morel &\nCarton 1994). The physical observation of these structures is not restricted to the labo-\nratory, however, as these tripoles have been observed in the ocean, \ufb01rst by Pingree &\nLe Cann (1992).\nThere remain a number of unresolved issues involving such multipolar vortices.\nFor what choices of Z0(r) and Zm(r) do such structures form? How, if at all, are\nthese multipoles (which have both signs of vorticity present) related to persistent cat\u2019s\neye structures in which the vorticity in the satellites is the same sign as the core?\nThe threshold parameter \u03b4 shows a dependence on the Reynolds number: does \u03b4(R)\nhave a limiting value in the inviscid limit as R \u2192 \u221e? Barba & Leonard (2007) have\nrun simulations showing that the threshold value \u03b4(R) decreases as R is increased,\nbut the large-Reynolds-number limit has not been extensively researched.\nThe aim of this paper is to address some of these issues using a combination of\nnumerical simulations and an asymptotic limit in which we consider vortices with\nsharp edges. To set the scene, we note that the phenomenon of tripole formation is\nnot restricted to Gaussian vortices: consider, for example the \u2018tanh\u2019 pro\ufb01les\nZ0(r) =\n1\n4\u03c0\n1 \u2212 tanh((r2 \u2212 \u03c3 2)\/(4(1 \u2212 \u03c3 )))\n1 + tanh(\u03c3 2\/(4(1 \u2212 \u03c3 ))) , (1.3)\nZ2(r) =\nr2\n4\u03c0\n1 \u2212 tanh ((r2 \u2212 \u03c3 22 ) \/(4(1 \u2212 \u03c32)))\n1 + tanh\n(\n\u03c3 22 \/(4(1 \u2212 \u03c32))\n) , (1.4)\n(Hall, Bassom & Gilbert 2003a). As \u03c3 and \u03c32 are varied from 0 to 1, the axisymmetric\nvortex and the perturbation change from a broad Gaussian-like form to a sharp\nRankine (top-hat) vortex. Figure 1(b) shows the evolution of these tanh pro\ufb01les into\na tripole for the parameter values \u03c3 = \u03c32 = 0.2, R =10\n4 and \u03b4=0.5. In this case, the\nnegative satellites are clearly visible as the black regions outside the vortex core. Note\nthat while such sharp-edged vortices are convenient mathematically, they also arise\nnaturally in geophysical systems and two-dimensional turbulence via processes such\nas vortex stripping (Legras & Dritschel 1993).\nUsing these tanh pro\ufb01les in the limit as \u03c3 \u2192 1 we are able to calculate an\ninviscid threshold for the formation of satellite vortices using the theory of Balmforth,\nLlewellyn Smith & Young (2001, hereinafter referred to as BLSY). As mentioned\nabove, another type of non-axisymmetric structure that can form is a ring of cat\u2019s\neyes around a vortex core, which has vorticity everywhere of one sign: here the \ufb02uid\ncirculates about each cat\u2019s eye (in a frame co-rotating with the ring) and the vorticity\nis locally \ufb02attened. To be clear about our terminology, we will use the term cat\u2019s eyes\nto refer to cases where the vorticity is everywhere of one sign, multipoles for both\nsigns, and satellites to refer to either. These cat\u2019s eyes may be generated for m = 2\nby exposing an axisymmetric vortex to an irrotational external strain \ufb01eld that is\nswitched o\ufb00 after some given time. For a su\ufb03ciently weak strain, the vortex returns\nto an axisymmetric state, and the non-axisymmetric perturbations are wound up into\nspiral \ufb01laments (Briggs, Daugherty & Levy 1970; Bassom & Gilbert 1998; Le Dize`s\n2000). If the amplitude, of the strain is above some threshold amplitude, however,\nthe vorticity can locally homogenize to form a pair of cat\u2019s eyes rotating around the\ncoherent vortex core (Schecter et al. 2000; Balmforth et al. 2001; Macaskill, Bassom &\nGilbert 2002; Turner & Gilbert 2007). Thus for m=2, cat\u2019s eyes appear similar to the\nsatellites in a tripole vortex, except they are of the same sign as the core.\n384 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\nThresholds for cat\u2019s eye formation in a Gaussian vortex have been obtained\nnumerically by Turner & Gilbert (2007) and by BLSY in their asymptotic model,\nwith qualitative agreement. In this paper, our aim is to study the threshold for the\nformation of satellite structures for sharp-edged vortices using the asymptotic model\nof BLSY in the absence of an external forcing, but with an initial condition equivalent\nto that in (1.1) used for the formation of multipolar vortices. This model begins with\na smooth monopole vortex with the pro\ufb01le\nZ0(r) = ZC(r) + \u0006ZS(r), (1.5)\nwhich consists of a compact vortex ZC(r), that is where the vorticity is identically zero\nbeyond some radius, plus an asymptotically small \u2018skirt\u2019 \u0006ZS(r). The small parameter\nthat is exploited is \u0006. The simplest example of a compact vortex is a Rankine vortex,\nwhere\nZC(r) =\n{\n1 (r < 1),\n0 (r > 1).\n(1.6)\nThis vortex supports an m = 2 Kelvin mode with a critical layer at r2 =\n\u221a\n2 where\nthe angular velocity of the mode is equal to that of the \ufb02uid. When a weak skirt is\nintroduced, this wave interacts with vorticity in the critical layer of width \u0006 and the\nnormal mode is replaced by a quasi-mode (Briggs et al. 1970; Schecter et al. 2000;\nTurner & Gilbert 2007). A quasi-mode is essentially a special transient solution of\nthe linear initial-value problem where the streamfunction decays exponentially and\nthe vorticity wraps up into spiral \ufb01laments without decay.\nThe BLSY model yields a coupled system comprising an ODE for the normal mode\namplitude and a PDE for the vorticity in the critical layer, and these authors study this\nsystem when the vortex is subjected to an external strain \ufb01eld. For weak strain there\nis the linear quasi-mode and exponential decay, but for stronger perturbations, above\na threshold, persistent cat\u2019s eyes form, as vorticity is homogenized in recirculating\nregions in the critical layer. We also note in passing that rather than the BLSY\napproach of solving the initial-value problem, Le Dize`s (2000) seeks steady states\nwith asymptotically thin cat\u2019s eyes, using a jump condition across the critical layer.\nWe adapt the asymptotic theory of BLSY to incorporate a non-zero initial mode\nm condition, such as the examples (1.1) to (1.4). This involves only two complex\nparameters, the initial amplitude of the normal mode and the initial strength of the\nmode m vorticity in the critical layer, and these reduce to three real parameters\nafter rotation. Thus, the question of the formation of satellite vortices, within the\nlimit of sharp-edged vortices (or similar ones \ufb01tting the BLSY framework) amounts\nto obtaining a threshold in a three-dimensional parameter space, when the initial\ncondition is allowed to evolve freely in time. Although we will be able to calculate\na threshold for the formation of satellites, we will not be able to determine the sign\nof the vorticity in the satellites because the governing equations for the vorticity are\nidentical to those where the vorticity has an arbitrary constant added to it. Focusing\non the m=2 case, we study three methods of computing a threshold contour. The \ufb01rst\ntwo are only qualitative: an in\ufb02ection point diagnostic calculates when the azimuthally\naveraged pro\ufb01le \ufb01rst develops an in\ufb02ection point at the critical radius, and a neutral\nmode diagnostic calculates when this azimuthal averaged pro\ufb01le supports a neutral\nmode. We then simulate the BLSY system to obtain the true asymptotic threshold\nusing a \u2018\ufb01rst bounce\u2019 criterion for when the vorticity perturbations feed back onto\nthe basic pro\ufb01le strongly enough to produce satellites. We discuss the usefulness of\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two-dimensional vortices 385\nthe qualitative diagnostics and con\ufb01rm the results by full Navier\u2013Stokes simulations\nof pro\ufb01les of the form (1.3) and (1.4).\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In \u00a7 2, we give the BLSY governing equations\nand discuss initial conditions. In \u00a7 3, we take a weakly nonlinear version of the BLSY\nequations and use this to calculate both the in\ufb02ection point and the neutral mode\nthresholds. Simulations of the BLSY system give the correct asymptotic threshold\nand are detailed in \u00a7 4, whereas comparison with full Navier\u2013Stokes simulations is\ngiven in \u00a7 5. Some concluding remarks are set out in \u00a7 6.\n2. Formulation\nIn this section, we give the equations from the asymptotic theory of BLSY. We use\ntheir notation; see their paper for derivations, in particular rescalings, and discussion\n(though a few results we need are to be found in Appendix B). The theory begins with\na pro\ufb01le of the form (1.5) which supports a normal mode with complex amplitude\n\u03d5\u02c6(t). This interacts with the total vorticity \u03b6T =\u03b2y + \u03b6 (y, \u03b8, t) in a thin critical layer,\nwhere y is a rescaled inward-pointing radial coordinate with the critical layer at y =0.\nThe parameter \u03b2 =\u00b1 1 speci\ufb01es the background gradient; our interest is only in the\ncase \u03b2 =1 so that the background pro\ufb01le is increasing with y, so decreasing with\nradius r , and the vortex is stable. The equations are, with m=2 from now on:\n\u2202t\u03b6 + y\u2202\u03b8\u03b6 + (\u03b2 + \u2202y\u03b6 )\u2202\u03b8\u03d5 = 0, (2.1)\ni\u2202t\u03d5\u02c6 = \u03c7(t) + \u3008e\u22122i\u03b8 \u03b6 \u3009, (2.2)\n\u03d5(\u03b8, t) = \u03d5\u02c6(t)e2i\u03b8 + c.c., (2.3)\n\u3008f \u3009 = PV\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndy\n\u222e\nf (y, \u03b8, t)\n2\u03c0\nd\u03b8. (2.4)\nThe normal mode of amplitude \u03d5\u02c6(t), riding on the compact vortex, drives a \ufb02ow with\nstreamfunction \u03d5(\u03b8, t) de\ufb01ned by (2.3) in the critical layer, and (2.1) gives advection\nof vorticity in this and the background shear from the compact vortex. Equation (2.2)\nthen gives the feedback on the normal mode with a principal-value integral de\ufb01ned\nby (2.4).\nWe set the external forcing, that is strain, \u03c7(t) to zero, but instead are interested\nin adding an initial mode 2 disturbance, as in (1.1)\u2013(1.4). In limits for which the\nBLSY theory applies, any initial disturbance of this form amounts to specifying the\ninitial complex amplitude \f of the normal mode, and the initial complex value of the\nmode 2 vorticity in the critical layer, given by another complex constant \u0393 . We thus\nuse the initial condition\n\u03b6 (y, \u03b8, t = 0) = \u03930 + \u0393 e\n2i\u03b8 + c.c., \u03d5\u02c6(t = 0) = \f. (2.5)\nHere, the additive constant \u03930, the mean vorticity in the critical layer, does not a\ufb00ect\nthe BLSY analysis as it does not enter into any of (2.1)\u2013(2.4); hence, we set \u03930 = 0\nthroughout the analysis. However, the value of this parameter in the full Navier\u2013\nStokes simulations ultimately determines whether the satellites formed are positive\n(cat\u2019s eyes) or negative (a tripole). Since after rotation, we can take one of \u0393 or\n\f to be purely real, we are left with a three-dimensional parameter space, and the\nquestion: for which points in this space do persistent structures form in the critical\nlayer? By solving (2.1)\u2013(2.5) in both weakly nonlinear and fully nonlinear settings,\nwe will calculate the in\ufb02ection point, neutral mode and \ufb01rst bounce thresholds, above\n386 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\nwhich the nonlinear satellites induced on the vortex persist, and below which the\nvortex returns to an axisymmetric state. These thresholds will be of the form\nF (\u0393,\f) = 0, (2.6)\nwhich gives a surface in parameter space. The results we will obtain are universal in\nthat they apply to any vortex for which the BLSY model is valid.\nHowever, to compare with full Navier\u2013Stokes simulations, we shall focus on the\nfamily of pro\ufb01les in (1.3), which tend to the Rankine vortex (1.6) as \u03c3 \u2192 1. In this\ncase, the m=2 critical layer occurs at r2 =\n\u221a\n2 and so the small parameter \u0006 for the\nasymptotic expansions is proportional to Z\u20320(r2), tending to zero as \u03c3 \u2192 1. In this case,\nthe constants \u0393 and \f are related to the parameters \u03b4 and \u03c32 from (1.4) via\n\u0393 =\n\u03b4Z2(r2)\n\u03c0Z\u20320(r2)2\n, \f =\n8\u03b4P2\n\u03c0Z\u20320(r2)2\n, (2.7)\nwhere P2 is a projection on the normal mode, given by\nP2 = \u2212 18\n(\u222b 1\n0\ns3Z2(s) ds + PV\n\u222b \u221e\n1\nsZ2(s)\n2 \u2212 s2 ds\n)\n. (2.8)\nThese rescalings and this projection formula are explained, in a general setting, in\nAppendix B.\nBecause of the principal-value integral in (2.4), the early evolution of this system\nwith the given initial condition has a singular forcing of the normal mode (cf. BLSY\n\u00a7 5.1). To handle this behaviour cleanly, we integrate over the short time interval from\nt =0 to a time t\u2217 satisfying 1\n t\u2217 \n 1\/L, where L is some large cuto\ufb00 value of the\nprincipal-value integral. We refer to this latter time t\u2217 as t =0+ for brevity. For very\nshort times, the (\u03b2 + \u2202y\u03b6 )\u2202\u03b8\u03d5 term in (2.1) is much smaller than the other two terms,\nand so we have\n\u03b6 (y, \u03b8, t) \u000b \u0393 e\u22122iyt+2i\u03b8 + c.c., (2.9)\nand then\ni\u2202t \u03d5\u02c6 = \u3008\u03b6e\u22122i\u03b8\u3009 \u000b \u0393 sin(2Lt)\nt\n. (2.10)\nTherefore on the short time scale of t = O(L\u22121), a large forcing of the quantity \u03d5\u02c6\ntakes place. Using \u222b \u221e\n0\nsin(u)\nu\ndu =\n\u03c0\n2\n, (2.11)\nwe \ufb01nd that at time t =0+, \u03d5\u02c6(0+)=\f \u2212 i\u03c0\u0393\/2.\nWe rewrite the initial-value problem (for numerical and analytical reasons), now\nstarting at time t =0+ by writing\n\u03b6 \u2032 = \u03b6 \u2212 (\u0393 e\u22122iyt+2i\u03b8 + c.c.), (2.12)\nto obtain the system of equations\n\u2202t\u03b6 + y\u2202\u03b8\u03b6\n\u2032 + (\u03b2 + \u2202y\u03b6 \u2032 \u2212 2it\u0393 e\u22122iyt+2i\u03b8 + 2it\u0393 \u2217e2iyt\u22122i\u03b8 )\u2202\u03b8\u03d5 = 0, (2.13)\ni\u2202t \u03d5\u02c6 = \u3008e\u22122i\u03b8 \u03b6 \u2032\u3009, \u03d5 = \u03d5\u02c6(t)e2i\u03b8 + c.c., (2.14)\n(where the star denotes the complex conjugate) with the new initial conditions\n\u03b6 \u2032(y, \u03b8, 0+) = 0, \u03d5\u02c6(0+) = \f \u2212 i\u03c0\u0393\/2. (2.15)\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two-dimensional vortices 387\nIn the next section, we derive the weakly nonlinear diagnostics we use for calculating\nour threshold criteria.\n3. Weakly nonlinear results\nIn this section, we consider a weakly nonlinear solution to (2.13)\u2013(2.15) and derive\nthe in\ufb02ection point and the neutral mode diagnostics for determining when satellites\npersist in a vortex or when the vortex returns to an axisymmetric state.\n3.1. Weakly nonlinear critical-layer equations\nWe seek an approximate solution to (2.13)\u2013(2.15) by introducing\n\u03b6 \u2032(y, \u03b8, t) = \u03b6\u02c6 \u2032(y, t)e2i\u03b8 + c.c. + \u03b6\u00af (y, t) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.1)\nThis expansion neglects all the higher-order e\ufb00ects; however, it does allow us to\ncalculate the two qualitative criteria described above which have been used in the\nstudy of BLSY. Substituting (3.1) into (2.13), we obtain the set of equations\n\u2202t \u03b6\u02c6\n\u2032 + 2iy \u03b6\u02c6 \u2032 + 2i\u03b2\u03d5\u02c6 = 0, (3.2)\n\u2202t \u03b6\u00af \u2212 2i(\u2202y \u03b6\u02c6 \u2032 \u2212 2it\u0393 e\u22122iyt )\u03d5\u02c6\u2217 + c.c. = 0, (3.3)\ni\u2202t \u03d5\u02c6 = \u3008\u03b6\u02c6 \u2032\u3009. (3.4)\nThe initial conditions for this problem are\n\u03b6\u02c6 \u2032(y, 0+) = 0, \u03b6\u00af (y, 0+) = 0, \u03d5\u02c6(0+) = \f \u2212 i\u03c0\u0393\/2. (3.5)\nThe quantity \u03b6\u00af is the correction to the azimuthal mean of the vorticity in the critical\nlayer and we seek the large-time form of this function to see how the initial condition\neventually alters the vorticity pro\ufb01le in the skirt. From this modi\ufb01cation, we can form\ndiagnostics to test whether satellites persist or not. These are only qualitative as the\nweakly nonlinear development does not apply quantitatively at \ufb01nite values, that is,\nnot at the threshold.\nWe solve (3.2) by the same method as in \u00a7 5.1 of BLSY, and using the initial\nconditions (3.5) gives\n\u03d5\u02c6 =\n(\n\f \u2212 i\u03c0\u0393\n2\n)\ne\u2212\u03c0\u03b2t , (3.6)\n\u03b6\u02c6 \u2032 = 2i\u03b2\n(\u03b2\u03c0+ 2iy)\n\u03b22\u03c02 + 4y2\n(e\u2212\u03c0\u03b2t \u2212 e\u22122iyt )\n(\n\f \u2212 i\u03c0\u0393\n2\n)\n. (3.7)\nThus, the large-time form of the solution for \u03b6\u00af in (3.3) can be expressed as\n\u03b6\u00af\u221e \u2261 \u03b6\u00af (y, t \u2192 \u221e) = \u221232\u03b2y |A|\n2 + \u03c0(Ai\u0393r \u2212 Ar\u0393i)\n(\u03b22\u03c02 + 4y2)2\n+ 8(\u03b22\u03c02 \u2212 4y2) Ar\u0393r + Ai\u0393i\n(\u03b22\u03c02 + 4y2)2\n,\n(3.8)\nwhere A=\f \u2212 i\u03c0\u0393\/2 and the subscripts r and i denote real and imaginary parts\nrespectively. As mentioned earlier, we can rotate our axes to make one of the quantities\n\u0393 or \f real; thus, without loss of generality we set \u0393r =\u0393 and \u0393i =0.\n3.2. In\ufb02ection-point diagnostic\nHere, we consider an in\ufb02ection-point diagnostic used by BLSY: we consider the\ncontour in parameter space where the azimuthally averaged total vorticity in the\n388 M.

Contour 3 de\ufb01nes the set of parameters for which the \ufb01rst bounce time t =45.\nThe stars represent parameter values used in the numerical simulations in \u00a7 4.\ncritical layer \u03b6T =\u03b2y + \u03b6\u00af\n\u221e \ufb01rst develops an extremal point at the critical radius\n(y =0). Using this diagnostic with \u03b6\u00af\u221e given by (3.8) and with \u0393 real, gives the\nexpression\nF (\u0393,\f) = \f2r + \f\n2\ni \u2212 \u03c0\n2\n4\n\u0393 2 \u2212 \u03c0\n4\n32\n= 0. (3.9)\nEquation (3.9) gives a three-dimensional surface in the parameter space (\u0393,\fr,\fi)\noutside which satellites persist and within which the vortex returns to axisymmetry\n(i.e. the streamfunction \u03d5\u02c6(t) decays to zero).\nFor the case when \f is also real, which corresponds to an initial condition of\nthe form used by the Navier\u2013Stokes simulations of Rossi et al. (1997) and Barba &\nLeonard (2007), we have a contour in the (\u0393,\f)-plane given by\nF (\u0393,\f) = \f2 \u2212 1\n4\n\u03c02\u0393 2 \u2212 1\n32\n\u03c04 = 0, (3.10)\nwhich describes two hyperbolae, centred on the point \f=\u0393 =0. For any parameter\nvalues lying between these hyperbolae, the vortex would be assumed to return to an\naxisymmetric state and not contain persistent satellites. This contour can be seen as\ncontour 1 in \ufb01gure 2.\nThis in\ufb02ection point threshold is over-simpli\ufb01ed so we do not expect it to agree\nwell with nonlinear simulations. This is because the existence of an extremal point\ndoes not guarantee satellite persistence, as was observed by BLSY for the generation\nof cat\u2019s eyes. Mo\u00a8ller & Montgomery (1999) have also used this method in the context\nof the full equations of motion and reached similar conclusions to the limitations of\nthis diagnostic. A more informative diagnostic is to calculate when the vortex has\nan axisymmetric basic pro\ufb01le that will maintain a neutral mode, i.e. one where\n\u03d5\u02c6(t)= constant. Neutral modes of an axisymmetric vortex have been seen to\ncorrespond to persistent cat\u2019s eye structures (Turner, Gilbert & Bassom 2008).\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two-dimensional vortices 389\n3.3. Neutral mode diagnostic\nTo calculate neutral modes of the axisymmetric total vorticity pro\ufb01le in the critical\nlayer \u03b6T =\u03b2y + \u03b6\u00af\n\u221e, we perform a normal mode analysis. This analysis is the same as\nthat in Hall et al. (2003a) and similar to that in BLSY. From (2.1) and (2.2), we solve\nthe linearized system\n\u2202t \u03b6\u02c6 + imy \u03b6\u02c6 + im(\u03b2 + \u2202y \u03b6\u00af\n\u221e)\u03d5\u02c6 = 0, i\u2202t \u03d5\u02c6 = PV\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u03b6\u02c6 (y, t) dy, (3.11)\nwhere we have taken a perturbation to the long-time mean pro\ufb01le\n\u03b6 = \u03b6\u00af\u221e(y) + \u03b6\u02c6 (y, t)eim\u03b8 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (3.12)\nFor this study m = 2, although m is left arbitrary in the following equations for\nmathematical clarity. Solving for \u03b6\u02c6 (y, t) as in \u00a7 3.2, with the initial condition \u03b6\u02c6 (y, 0+) =\n0, and substituting this into the equation for \u03d5\u02c6 gives\n\u2202t \u03d5\u02c6 = \u2212m\u03b2\u03c0\n2\n\u03d5\u02c6 \u2212\n\u222b t\n0\nK(t \u2212 s)\u03d5\u02c6(s) ds, (3.13)\nwhere the kernel\nK(t) = m\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2202y\u03b6\u00af\n\u221ee\u2212imyt dy . (3.14)\nSeeking a solution to (3.13) of the form \u03d5\u02c6 \u221d e\u03b3 t leads to an implicit equation for the\ngrowth rate \u03b3 :\n\u03b3 = \u2212m\u03b2\u03c0\n2\n\u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u03b3 uK(u) du. (3.15)\nSubstituting (3.8) into (3.14), integrating the kernel K(t) in (3.15) by parts and then\nusing residue calculations, we can express the equation for \u03b3 in the implicit form\n\u03b3 = \u2212m\u03c0\n2\n\u2212 32m\n3\u03c1\n(\u03c0m + 2\u03b3 )3\n, (3.16)\nwhere \u03b2 has been set equal to unity, and\n\u03c1 = i\u03c0\u0393\fr \u2212\n(\n\f2r + \f\n2\ni \u2212 \u03c0\n2\n4\n\u0393 2\n)\n(3.17)\nis a constant which depends on the initial conditions.\nFor an arbitrary set of initial conditions, (3.16) can be solved to give a complex\ngrowth rate \u03b3 = \u03b3r +i\u03b3i . We are interested in neutrally stable solutions of this equation\n(\u03b3r =0) which will correspond to the initial condition producing persistent nonlinear\nsatellites. This is achieved by solving the quartic equation (3.16) for \u03b3 with some initial\nset of parameters (\u0393,\fr,\fi) and singling out the growth rate with the smallest real\npart. With two of these parameters \ufb01xed, the third is varied until \u03b3r =0 whereupon a\nsecond parameter is then changed and the \ufb01rst is again updated until \u03b3r =0. With the\nthird parameter held \ufb01xed, this maps out a curve in the two-dimensional plane which\nsatis\ufb01es this constraint of neutral stability. For illustration, we consider again the case\nwhen \fi =0 and compare the neutral stability contour for this diagnostic (contour 2),\nwith the contour given by (3.10) for the in\ufb02ection point diagnostic (contour 1); these\ncontours are plotted in \ufb01gure 2.\nFigure 2 shows that the neutral mode diagnostic (contour 2) produces a closed\ncontour in the (\u0393,\f)-plane, which has a much smaller region of decaying solutions\n390 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\nthan the in\ufb02ection point diagnostic (contour 1). Both diagnostics agree at the points\n\u0393 =0, \f=\u00b1\u03c02\/4\u221a2\u000b \u00b1 1.744, which are given in BLSY. We expect the actual\nthreshold contour of the fully nonlinear problem to di\ufb00er from the neutral mode\ncontour, because the nonlinear e\ufb00ects not present in the neutral mode analysis are\nimportant for the formation of satellites.\n4. Numerical simulation and the \ufb01rst bounce diagnostic\nThe two weakly nonlinear diagnostics formulated in \u00a7 3 depend only on the form\nof the large-time vorticity perturbation \u03b6\u00af\u221e(y). The in\ufb02ection point diagnostic is quite\ncrude, and although the neutral mode diagnostic ensures a persistent perturbation,\nit is based on only a weakly nonlinear development, and so discards the higher-\norder Fourier modes and their interactions. In this section, we formulate a nonlinear\nquantitative diagnostic which comes from the numerical solution of (2.13)\u2013(2.15).\nEquation (2.13) is solved by expanding \u03b6 \u2032 as a series of even Fourier harmonics:\n\u03b6 \u2032(y, \u03b8, t) =\nN\u2211\nn=\u2212N\n\u03b6 \u20322n(y, t)e\n2in\u03b8 . (4.1)\nTo aid the numerical stability of our code, we introduce the di\ufb00usive term R\u22121e\ufb00 \u22022y \u03b6 \u2032\nto the right-hand side of (2.13) (Hall et al. 2003b). The inclusion of this viscous\nterm destroys any \ufb01ne-scale structure in the vorticity \ufb01eld, but this does not a\ufb00ect\nthe threshold values we calculate. Moreover, we have checked that for Re\ufb00 \u0002 105\nthe results are insensitive to the value of Re\ufb00: we set Re\ufb00 =10\n5 and our results are,\nfor practical purposes, inviscid. This system of equations is then marched forward\nin time using a Crank\u2013Nicolson scheme for the advective and di\ufb00usive terms, and\nan Adams\u2013Bashforth method for the nonlinear terms. The coordinate y across the\ncritical layer is treated via a \ufb01nite-di\ufb00erence scheme.\nFor simplicity, the PDE (2.13) is discretized in the \ufb01nite domain y \u2208 [\u2212L,L];\nthus boundary conditions are imposed on \u03b6 \u20322n at y = \u00b1 L for n=0, 1, . . . , N . This is\nachieved by considering the large-y asymptotic form of the solutions for each \u03b6 \u20322n. It\nis possible to calculate numerous terms in these asymptotic expansions; however, for\nnumerical accuracy, it is su\ufb03cient to use only the leading-order terms. The large-y\nconditions imposed are\n\u03b6 \u20320 \u223c 2ity\u22121(\u0393 \u03d5\u02c6\u2217e\u22122iyt \u2212 \u0393 \u2217\u03d5\u02c6e2iyt ), (4.2)\n\u03b6 \u20322 \u223c \u2212\u03b2\u03d5\u02c6y\u22121 + \u03b2(\f \u2212 i\u03c0\u0393\/2)y\u22121e\u22122iyt , (4.3)\n\u03b6 \u20324 \u223c 2it\u0393 \u03d5\u02c6y\u22121e\u22122iyt , (4.4)\n\u03b6 \u20322n \u223c 0, \u2200 n > 2. (4.5)\nThe numerical solution of \u03d5\u02c6 contains oscillations which are due to the integral\nof \u3008\u03b6 \u20322\u3009 in (2.14) being approximated over a \ufb01nite range of y. These oscillations are\nremoved at leading order by using (4.3) to approximate the integral in (2.14) outside\nthe y \u2208 [\u2212L,L] domain; this calculation is given in Appendix A. This method,\nhowever, does not remove all the oscillations, which persist at the next order, and\nso we time-average our solution to produce a smooth result, as is also described in\nAppendix A.\nIn the present study, we found it su\ufb03cient to set the parameter L=20. For all\nthe threshold calculations in this paper, we found using M =5001 grid points in the\ny-direction and N =32 equations to be the minimum values needed to give consistent\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two-dimensional vortices 391\n0.10\n(a) (b)\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n\u20130.02\n0.05\n0\n\u20130.05\n\u20130.10\n\u201310 \u20135 0\ny\n5 10 \u201310 \u20135 0\ny\n5 10\n\u03b6\u221e\nFigure 3.

For nonlinear calculations (i.e. larger \u0393 and \f) just above the threshold for\nsatellite formation these should be increased to M =8001 and N =128.\nFigure 3 shows two results of the numerical solution of (2.13)\u2013(2.15) when the initial\ncondition parameters \u0393 and \f are both real. The correction to the mean azimuthal\npro\ufb01le \u03b6\u00af (y) is plotted at t =40 and compared with the \u03b6\u00af\u221e(y) result in (3.8) for\n(a) (\u0393,\f)= (0, 0.3) and (b) (\u0393,\f)= (0.3, 0.3). For both cases, the numerical solution\n(solid line) and the asymptotic model (dotted line) are in very good agreement with one\nanother showing that the numerical code works correctly. The small di\ufb00erence between\nthe two methods is due to higher-order terms of the small-amplitude expansion, and\nthis di\ufb00erence increases as the parameters \u0393 and \f are increased towards the threshold\nvalues and beyond.\nFigures 4 and 5 show typical results from the numerical solution of (2.13)\u2013(2.15).\nFigure 4 shows |\u03d5\u02c6| on a log scale as a function of t for three runs with (\u0393,\f)= (0.2, 0.7)\nfor curve 1, (\u0393,\f)= (0.4, 0.9) for curve 2 and (\u0393,\f)= (0.4, 1.1) for curve 3. The\nparameter values for curve 1 correspond to a case where |\u03d5\u02c6| decays to very small\nvalues very quickly, and never increases again at large times. This is a weak initial\ncondition run, where the vortex would return to an axisymmetric state and the\nperturbation would wind up. Curve 3 in \ufb01gure 4 is a run with a strong initial\ncondition for which |\u03d5\u02c6| rises in value after an initial period of decay and then\noscillates about |\u03d5\u02c6|=0.01. This corresponds to a case where satellites form in the\ncritical layer, as can be seen in the total vorticity plot in \ufb01gure 5(b). In this plot we\ncan see the total vorticity \u03b6T = y + \u03b6 winding around inside the satellites, and that\nowing to the introduction of a non-zero \u0393 , these satellites are no longer situated at\ny =0 as they would be if \u0393 =0 (see \ufb01gure 16 of BLSY). Curve 2 in \ufb01gure 4 represents\na case between the other two, where |\u03d5\u02c6| does rise after an initial period of decay, but\nit does not oscillate around quite as rapidly as curve 3. The total vorticity for curve 2\nat t =60 can be seen in \ufb01gure 5(a). This plot again shows the vorticity winding around\nin the critical layer, but in this case the winding is not so clear, and also there is some\nbreaking up of the \ufb02ow in the centre of the satellite. We shall see later that this case\nlies on the threshold between persistent satellites and decaying solutions. These three\nparameter values are plotted as the stars in \ufb01gure 2 of \u00a7 3.\nThe study of BLSY determines whether or not generated cat\u2019s eyes persist or decay\naway by considering the \u2018\ufb01rst bounce\u2019 in the streamfunction, |\u03d5\u02c6(t)|.

When \f \u0003 0.1, |\u03d5\u02c6(t)| is a smooth function (see the solid line in \ufb01gure 6),\nand so measuring the position of the \ufb01rst bounce is simple. However, when \f is\nsmall and \u0393 is moderately large (see dashed line in \ufb01gure 6), then there is a feedback\nfrom the vorticity in the critical layer to the streamfunction and vice versa. Thus,\n|\u03d5\u02c6(t)| contains oscillations and so calculating the position of the \ufb01rst bounce is more\ncomplicated. For this case, a \ufb01rst bounce \ufb01t is done by eye rather than by calculating\nthe position of this turning point in the time-averaged streamfunction.\nIn their study, BLSY use as a criterion that if the \ufb01rst bounce occurs after t =45\nthen cat\u2019s eyes do not persist. This time value places an upper bound on the threshold\ncontour and avoids numerical error which can accumulate in long-time integrations\nwith small values of \u03d5\u02c6.

The arrows denote the \ufb01rst bounce as de\ufb01ned in BLSY.\nchoice of this cuto\ufb00 time, we adopt this same criterion for our study. To calculate the\nthreshold curve for this diagnostic with \u0393 and \f real, we reduce \f for a \ufb01xed \u0393 until\nthe \ufb01rst bounce occurs after t =45. This will generate a contour in the (\u0393,\f)-plane\nwithin which satellites decay and outside which they persist.\nThe \ufb01rst bounce threshold described above is plotted as contour 3 in \ufb01gure 2\nalong with the in\ufb02ection point threshold (contour 1) and the neutral mode threshold\n(contour 2). We see that the \ufb01rst bounce threshold gives a much smaller region of\nthe parameter space where satellites decay, although the shape of this contour is very\nsimilar to that of the neutral mode threshold and the di\ufb00erence between the two\nis only roughly a factor of 2. The point on the contour where \u0393 =0 (\f \u000b 0.97)\nagrees exactly with the value for an instantaneous kick (T =0) in \ufb01gure 13 of BLSY.\nAlthough increasing the cuto\ufb00 time t =45 used in our criterion will bring the contour\nin slightly, the numerical evidence from simulations of (2.13)\u2013(2.15) is that the e\ufb00ect\nis very minor, the position of the contour is insensitive to this choice and that for\ndisturbances inside this contour the streamfunction ultimately decays. In the next\nsection, we examine this statement further by running full nonlinear simulations of\nthe Navier\u2013Stokes equations and comparing the results to the threshold given by the\nasymptotic model.\n5. Comparison with Navier\u2013Stokes simulations\nIn \u00a7 4, we calculated the \ufb01rst bounce threshold in parameter space using the\nasymptotic theory of BLSY, within which satellites decay and the vortex returns to an\naxisymmetric state and outside which they persist and the vortex remains elliptical.\nIn this section, we form a link from the parameter values in this asymptotic method\nto the parameter values related to full Navier\u2013Stokes simulations in (1.1), (1.3) and\n(1.4). Our simulations will show that there is a region of parameter space where the\nasymptotic model agrees well with the full numerical simulations, and outside this\n394 M. R. Turner and A. D.

For more information on this numerical scheme see\nTurner & Gilbert (2007). The initial condition used in the simulations is given by\n(1.1) where Z0(r) is as in (1.3), but here we write\nZ2(r) =\nra\n4\u03c0\n1 \u2212 tanh ((r2 \u2212 \u03c3 22 ) \/(4(1 \u2212 \u03c32)))\n1 + tanh\n(\n\u03c3 22 \/(4(1 \u2212 \u03c32))\n) , (5.1)\nwhere\na =\n1\n2(1 \u2212 \u03c32)\n(\n1 + tanh\n(\n1 + \u03c32\n4\n))\n. (5.2)\nThis is because now the maximum value of Z2(r) occurs at r =1 for all \u03c32, which\nimproves the comparison with the asymptotic theory as the position of the maximum\nof Z2(r) now agrees with that of g(r) in (B 2). However, this form of Z2(r) is only\nappropriate for \u03c32 > 0.65 because then a > 2 and the function Z2(r) is relatively\nsmooth at the origin.\nThe parameter \u03c3 in (1.3) is chosen close to 1 so that the vortex resembles a Rankine\nvortex plus a small asymptotic skirt \u0006ZS(r) as in (1.5). Thus when calculating \u0006ZS at\nthe critical layer r = r2, outside the core of the vortex, we identify this with Z0(r2).\nFigure 7 plots the vorticity pro\ufb01le (1.3) with \u03c3 =0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1 showing that as\n\u03c3 approaches 1, the pro\ufb01le tends to a Rankine vortex.

For each\n\u03c3 , we ran our numerical simulation for various values of \u03b4, and by considering the\nmagnitude of the second multipole moment Q2(t) where, in general,\nQm(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nrm+1\u03b6m dr, (5.3)\nwe were able to determine whether satellites persist, signalled by |Q2(t)| not decaying.\nBy way of illustration, \ufb01gure 8 plots ln |Q2(t)| for \u03c3 = \u03c32 = 0.78 and \u03b4=0.037 (solid\nline) and \u03b4=0.111 (dotted line). The solid line is a case where |Q2| decays and\nthe perturbation decays, while the dotted line is a case where |Q2| oscillates and\nthe satellites persist. All of the numerical simulations were run with a Reynolds\nnumber R =107, which at \ufb01rst sight appears large enough to ensure that the results\nare inviscid for practical purposes. However, as we will see shortly, this Reynolds\nnumber maps to the e\ufb00ective Reynolds number, Re\ufb00, for the asymptotic theory which\nin certain parameter ranges may no longer be large enough to guarantee that the\nevolution is practically inviscid on the (short) spatial and (long) temporal scales of\nthe critical layer.\nFigure 9 plots Z\u20320(r2) against \u03b4, where our full Navier\u2013Stokes simulations are\nrepresented by points in this plane.

We see that the agreement between the numerical simulations\nand the asymptotic theory improves as the small parameter Z\u20320(r2) decreases, which is\nas expected because this value is equivalent to the small parameter \u0006 in the asymptotic\ntheory. Note that the range of good agreement occurs for Z\u20320(r2)\u0004 0.021 (\u03c3 \u0002 0.8);\nby examining the vorticity pro\ufb01les in \ufb01gure 7, we can see that the \u03c3 =0.8 pro\ufb01le is\nactually quite broad and thus this asymptotic theory agrees well with the numerical\nsimulations for reasonably broad vortices as well as ones with sharper edges. However,\nfor Z\u20320(r2)\u0004 0.0132 (or \u03c3 \u0002 0.84), we \ufb01nd that the good agreement begins to evaporate:\nat parameter values where satellites should persist according to the asymptotic model,\nthe full simulation shows decay. This can be explained by considering the Reynolds\nnumber R from the full numerical simulations and the e\ufb00ective Reynolds number\nof the asymptotic theory Re\ufb00 based on the spatial and temporal scales in the critical\nlayer; these both conspire to make Re\ufb00 much less than R for small \u0006. More speci\ufb01cally,\nthese two quantities are related via the expression\nR\u22121e\ufb00 = R\n\u22121 \u0006\u22123L\u22122T, (5.4)\nwhere L and T are the length and time scales given in (B 7) of Appendix B (Hall\net al. 2003b). When the limiting compact vortex is the Rankine vortex, as for our\nsimulations, we obtain\nR\u22121e\ufb00 =\n8\n\u221a\n2R\u22121\n\u03c02|Z\u20320(r2)|3 .

For\nthe values of 0.016<Z\u20320(r2)< 0.021, we obtain good agreement between the numerical\nsimulations and the asymptotic theory (see \ufb01gure 9) and we see from \ufb01gure 10 that the\ne\ufb00ective di\ufb00usivity R\u22121e\ufb00 is reasonably small in this region.

For Z\u20320(r2) > 0.021, R\u22121e\ufb00 decreases\nfurther and so the reason for the disagreement between the results in \ufb01gure 9 in this\nregion is not due to di\ufb00usive e\ufb00ects, but is simply that our vorticity pro\ufb01le Z0(r)\nis no longer close enough to the asymptotic limit of Rankine vortex plus a skirt of\nvanishing strength.\nHowever, as we decrease Z\u20320(r2) from 0.016, our vorticity pro\ufb01le becomes much\nmore like a Rankine vortex plus a skirt, so we expect our full simulations to agree\nbetter with the asymptotic theory. Unfortunately because the critical layer becomes\nthinner, the e\ufb00ective Reynolds number decreases and di\ufb00usive e\ufb00ects become more\nsigni\ufb01cant. This problem can be overcome by increasing the Reynolds number R of\nthe full simulation. When a simulation plotted in \ufb01gure 9 shows persisting satellites,\nwe observe that increasing R does not make them decay, but it can make a decaying\nsimulation grow or persist by making the problem more inviscid. Results of the full\nsimulation with R =108, 109 and 1010 show that the decay observed above the solid\nline in \ufb01gure 9 for Z\u20320(r2) < 0.016 appears to turn into persistence and growth, while\nthe parameter values below the line still give decay. However, at these large Reynolds\nnumbers, the full numerical simulation could not be run for the same length of time\nas the R =107 case; although we could not verify that these results would persist to\nthe same accuracy as in \ufb01gure 9, the evidence we have does suggest this is the case.\nOverall, we believe that our numerical results indicate that the asymptotic theory is\ncorrect, and discrepancies for very sharp vortices are down to the limits of running\nsimulations at su\ufb03ciently high Reynolds numbers.\nIn the asymptotic theory, the sign of vorticity in the critical layer is of secondary\nconsideration as the constant \u03930 in (2.5) has no in\ufb02uence on the dynamics. Thus when\nsatellites are formed they could equally well be positive, cat\u2019s eyes or negative satellites\ngiving a tripole, depending on the value of \u03930. We note that a similar issue arises\nin the Navier\u2013Stokes simulations, as a constant can be added to the initial vorticity\n398 M. R. Turner and A. D.

This has led us to conclude that\nboth a tripole and a vortex with cat\u2019s eyes amount to the same nonlinear structure,\nbut the sign of the vorticity in the satellites is entirely dependent on the average level\nof vorticity around the critical layer initially.\nWe highlight this below with a typical Navier\u2013Stokes simulation. The form of the\ninitial vorticity pro\ufb01le (1.1) is that of a positive elliptical core with two negative regions\nof vorticity above and below the core (with m=2), this can be seen in \ufb01gure 11(a).\nFigure 11 shows the evolution of an initial vorticity distribution with \u03c32 = \u03c3 =0.8\nand \u03b4=0.2212. This case is one which has persistent satellites. The vorticity plotted\nis capped at |Z|=10\u22124. The positive vorticity is white in the \ufb01gure, grey signi\ufb01es zero\nvorticity and the black regions are regions of negative vorticity. We see in \ufb01gure 11\nthat the satellites do persist for long times, and the vorticity in the critical layer\nincludes negative inclusions (depicted as black). This means that this is a tripole with\na positive core and two negative satellites rotating around it as in \ufb01gure 1. However,\nadding on the constant Zmin to the initial pro\ufb01le (1.1), where Zmin is the minimum\nvorticity in the run depicted in \ufb01gure 11, would produce a vortex with the same\nstructure as in \ufb01gure 11 except the black regions would now correspond to regions\nof positive vorticity. Note that we could add on a constant globally, or just locally\nwithin the critical layer by modifying the initial pro\ufb01le.\nThe simulation with \u03b4=0.2212 in \ufb01gure 11 is well above the threshold for persistent\nsatellites, as can be seen in \ufb01gure 9. For simulations just above the threshold for\npersistence, the satellites are very thin and viscous e\ufb00ects come into play: in a plot\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two-dimensional vortices 399\nsimilar to \ufb01gure 11, it would be di\ufb03cult to see the sign of the vorticity in the critical\nlayer, and so whether there are positive or negative satellites present.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have studied the evolution of a sharp-edged vortex with an additive\nperturbation via both asymptotic and numerical methods. We adapt the asymptotic\ntheory of BLSY so that we can stipulate an initial amplitude of mode m vorticity\nin the critical layer and an initial streamfunction amplitude of the perturbation. In\nthe case when these two parameters are real we were able to construct a contour in\nthis parameter space, within which the streamfunction decays in time and the vortex\nreturns to an axisymmetric state and outside which the vortex remains elliptical\nand a satellite structure persists in the vortex. The results from this paper were all\nconstructed with Z2(r) real, and hence \u0393 and \f real, to agree with the studies of\nRossi et al. (1997) and Barba & Leonard (2007), but could be extended to cover the\nfull three-dimensional parameter space. Also, it should be noted that these results\nare universal in that they apply to any family of vortices for which the BLSY theory\nbecomes valid, in other words which asymptotically have the structure of a compact\nvortex supporting a normal mode, plus a weak skirt of vorticity. Thus by considering\nthe family of compact vortices in BLSY, we could calculate \u0393 and \f, via (B 10) and\n(B 13), for the Gaussian pro\ufb01les used by Rossi et al. (1997) and Barba & Leonard\n(2007), and hence qualitatively verify their results.\nWe compared our \ufb01rst bounce threshold from the nonlinear study to two thresholds\nbased on weakly nonlinear theory, an in\ufb02ection point threshold and a neutral mode\nthreshold. The in\ufb02ection point threshold was very crude and did not agree well with\nthe \ufb01rst bounce threshold; however, the neutral mode threshold agreed in shape with\nthe \ufb01rst bounce threshold and was only out by a factor of two in magnitude.\nThe \ufb01rst bounce threshold was compared to full numerical simulations of\nthe Navier\u2013Stokes equations. These simulations showed that as our core vortex\napproached a Rankine vortex plus an asymptotic skirt the numerical results agree\nwell with the asymptotic results while the e\ufb00ective Reynolds number was large. The\nNavier\u2013Stokes simulations, like the BLSY model, are una\ufb00ected by the addition\nof a constant of vorticity initially. This has led us to conclude that these satellite\nstructures successfully describe both multipole and cat\u2019s eye vortices, i.e these two\ntypes of vortices are essentially the same, except their azimuthal averaged pro\ufb01les\nwill be di\ufb00erent (Barba & Leonard 2007; Turner & Gilbert 2007). In the context of\ngeophysical applications and two-dimensional turbulence, sharp-edged vortices are\ncommonplace and our study indicates that the thresholds for the formulation of\ntripole structures will tend to be low in cases when the critical layer lies beyond\nthe sharp edge. Of course, continual external forcing of such vortices is likely to\nlead generally to a more complex vorticity structure in the layer, and a \u2018surf zone\u2019\ncan occur (Thuburn & Lagneau 1999). The enhanced mixing that occurs in such\nzones can, in turn, sharpen up the edge of the vortex, and this interaction of mixing\nand pro\ufb01le evolution is currently under investigation in random and deterministic\ncontexts.\nThis work was undertaken on the EPSRC grant EP\/D032202\/1.

Asymptotic form of the integral in (2.14) outside\nof y \u2208 [\u2212L,L]\nIn this Appendix we show how the large-y asymptotic solutions to (2.13)\u2013(2.15) are\nused to approximate the contribution to the integral \u3008\u03b6 \u20322\u3009 in (2.14) from outside the\ndomain y \u2208 [\u2212L,L]. To calculate the correction terms to this integral outside this\ndomain up to O(L\u22121), we require the O(y\u22122) terms in (4.3). These can be calculated\neasily and give\n\u03b6 \u20322 \u223c \u2212\u03b2\u03d5\u02c6y +\n\u03b2(\f \u2212 i\u03c0\u0393\/2)e\u22122iyt\ny\n\u2212 i\u03b2\u03d5\u02c6t\n2y2\n\u22122t\n2\u03d5\u02c62\u0393 \u2217e2iyt\ny2\n\u2212 i\u03b2\n2\u03c0\n2y2\n(\n\f \u2212 i\u03c0\u0393\n2\n)\ne\u22122iyt .

This\napproach is equivalent to that in Appendix A of BLSY; however, in this case, the\nnon-zero initial conditions produce a more complicated expression.\nThe inclusion of these correction terms in (2.14) eliminates the oscillations that\noccur in the numerical solution of \u03d5\u02c6 at leading order. However, oscillations remain\nat the order of L\u22122, and we have not tried to eliminate these completely because it\nwould require many correction terms. Thus, to produce a smooth function of \u03d5\u02c6(t),\nfor plotting and calculation purposes, we time average the solution over the period\n\u03c0\/L of the oscillations. As an example, plots of |\u03d5\u02c6(t)| with (\u0393,\f)= (0, 1) with and\nwithout time-averaging are shown in \ufb01gure 12. As L is increased, the period of the\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two-dimensional vortices 401\noscillations reduces as O(L\u22122), as does the amplitude at the same rate; however, it is\nnot practical to remove the oscillations this way as this requires an increase in the\nnumber of mesh points in the y-direction which increases the running time of the\ncode making it numerically impractical. We found that varying L produces consistent\ntime-averaged results.\nAppendix B. Asymptotic theory\nIn this Appendix, we give a brief overview of quantities from the derivation of the\nasymptotic theory used in the paper, in particular (B 10), (B 13) and (B 24).

We seek an asymptotic solution for the total vorticity\nZ of the Navier\u2013Stokes equation in the form\nZ(r) = ZC(r) + \u0006ZS(r) + \u0006\n2\u03b6 0 + \u00063\u03b6 1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (B 1)\nThe quantity ZC(r) is the vorticity pro\ufb01le of a compact vortex, which we take to be\na Rankine vortex in the main paper, ZS(r) is an asymptotic skirt and \u0006 \u0011 1. In the\nmain body of the paper, the quantity ZC(r) + \u0006ZS(r) is combined into the full pro\ufb01le\nZ0(r), which is the tanh pro\ufb01le for our full simulations.\nWe consider perturbations to the compact vortex: such a vortex may support a\nfamily of (undamped) Kelvin waves, at most one for each mode m. Each Kelvin wave\nhas a critical radius rm, where the vortex and the \ufb02uid co-rotate with angular frequency\n\u03c9m. We let the functions f (r) and g(r) be the corresponding linear perturbations to\nthe streamfunction and vorticity. For the Rankine vortex these are\nfm(r) =\n{\n(rmr)\nm (r < 1),\n(rm\/r)\nm (r > 1),\ngm(r) = \u22122mrmm\u03b4(r \u2212 1). (B 2)\nOutside the critical layer at r = rm, the solution is the Kelvin wave with a complex\namplitude that evolves, slowly, according to the behaviour in the critical layer,\n[\u03c80, \u03b6 0] = a(\u03d1, \u03c4 )[f (r), g(r)]. (B 3)\nHere \u03d1 = \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9mt , \u03c4 = \u0006t is a slow time scale and a(\u03d1, \u03c4 )= a\u02c6(\u03c4 )eim\u03d1 + c.c. is the\namplitude function, where rm =(m\/(m \u2212 1))1\/2. In deriving (2.1)\u2013(2.4) the following\nquantities appear\nI1 = \u2212\n\u222b RC\n0\nrfg\nmrm\u03a9\u02dcC\ndr, \u03a9\u02dcC \u2261 \u03a9C(r) \u2212 \u03a9C(rm), (B 4)\nwhere RC is the radius of the compact vortex, beyond which ZC =0.\nThe gradient of the vorticity inside the critical layer scales as\n\u03b2 \u2261 sgn (\u03bcm) = \u2212sgn(Z\u2032S(rm)), (B 5)\nwhere\n\u03bcm \u2261 Z\n\u2032\nS(rm)\nrm\u03a9\u02dc\n\u2032\nC(rm)\n. (B 6)\nWhen \u03b2 = \u2212 1, the vortex has a positive skirt and hence gives unstable solutions. As\nwe are interested only in stable solutions, we set \u03b2 =1 in this study. The system has\na second rescaling by introducing the space and time scales\nL \u2261 \u2212 |\u03bcm|I1\u03a9\u02dc \u2032C(rm)\n, T \u2261 I1|\u03bcm| . (B 7)\n402 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\nTo determine the constants \u0393 and \f in terms of \u03b4 and Zm(r), consider the initial\nvorticity distribution of the fully nonlinear Navier\u2013Stokes simulations\nZ = ZC(r) + \u0006ZS(r) + \u03b4Zm(r)e\nim\u03b8 + c.c., (B 8)\nwhere \u03b4 and the form of the mode Zm(r) determine the values of \u0393 and \f. In this\nAppendix, we show how these parameters are related to the parameter \u03b4 of the fully\nnonlinear problem. In the critical layer, at t =0, we compare the expansion (B 8)\nwith\nZ = ZC(r) + \u0006ZS(r) + \u0006\n2\u03b6 0(r, \u03b8) + \u00063\u03b6 1(r, \u03b8) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (B 9)\nOmitting some details on the scalings (to be found in BLSY), when this is rescaled,\nwe \ufb01nd the amplitude of the mode m in the critical layer to be\n\u0393 =\nT\nrm|\u03bcm| \u0006\n\u22122\u03b4Zm(rm) =\nrmI1\u03a9\u02dc \u20322C (rm)\n\u00062Z\u20322S (rm)\n\u03b4Zm(rm). (B 10)\nOutside the critical layer, we compare (B 8) at t =0 with the expansion\nZ = ZC(r) + \u0006ZS(r) + \u0006\n2a\u02c6(0)g(r)eim\u03b8 + c.c. + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (B 11)\nwhere the function g(r) for a Rankine vortex is de\ufb01ned in (B 2). At leading order,\nwe can neglect the e\ufb00ect of the skirt and just consider perturbations to the compact\nvortex Z=ZC . The initial perturbation \u03b4Zm(r)e\nim\u03b8 will excite the normal mode by\nan amount we call \u03b4Pm and it will also excite the continuous spectrum. The latter\nperturbations will wind up and become \ufb01nely scaled on the fast t-time scale, and\nhence are irrelevant. However, the perturbation to the normal mode will evolve on\nthe slow \u03c4 -time scale and so will be signi\ufb01cant.\nIt is su\ufb03cient to write the initial condition as\na\u02c6(0) = \u0006\u22122\u03b4Pm, (B 12)\nwhere Pm is the projection onto the normal mode, to be determined shortly. Rescaling\nthis initial condition we \ufb01nd\n\f = \u03d5\u02c6(0) =\nT\nrmL a\u02c6(0) = \u2212\nrmI21\u03a9\u02dc \u20323C (rm)\n\u00062Z\u20322S (rm)\n\u03b4Pm. (B 13)\nTo \ufb01nd the value of the projection Pm, we consider the linearized form of the\nNavier\u2013Stokes equation by writing\n\u03b6 = \u03b60(r) + \u03b6m(r, t)e\nim\u03b8 , \u03c8 = \u03c80(r) + \u03c8m(r, t)e\nim\u03b8 . (B 14)\nWe then take the Laplace transform of the resulting equation with respect to t , with\nf\u00af m(p) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\neiptfm(t) dt, fm(t) = \u2212 1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b \u2212\u221e+i\u03b3\n\u221e+i\u03b3\ne\u2212ipt f\u00af m(p) dp. (B 15)\nIt can be shown that the Laplace transform of the multipole moment Qm(t) in (5.3)\ncan be written as\nQ\u00afm(p) = lim\nr0\u2192\u221e\n\u2212 ir\nm\n0\n\u03a8L(r0, p)\n\u222b r0\n0\ns\u03a8L(s, p)\u03b6m(s, 0)\nm\u03a9C(s) \u2212 p ds, (B 16)\nThresholds for the formation of satellites in two-dimensional vortices 403\n(Schecter et al. 2000; Turner & Gilbert 2007), where \u03a8L(r, p) satis\ufb01es the homogeneous\nequation [\n\u22022\n\u2202r2\n+\n1\nr\n\u2202\n\u2202r\n\u2212 m\n2\nr2\n+\nmZ\u2032C(r)\nr(p \u2212 m\u03a9C(r))\n]\n\u03a8L(r, p) = 0, (B 17)\nwith \u03a8L(0, p)= 0. Here, r = r0 is a large radius, that is taken to be \ufb01nite and then\nallowed to tend to in\ufb01nity. When (B 16) is inverted to \ufb01nd Qm(t), the inversion\ncontour is closed around any singularities in the p-plane. These singularities can\noccur because of the normal mode, when \u03a8L(r0 \u2192 \u221e, p) vanishes for some p, or\nbecause m\u03a9C(s) \u2212 p vanishes for some s in the range 0 to \u221e. The second of these\nis the continuous spectrum of the vortex, which may be bent below the real p-axis\nby moving the s-contour above the real s-axis in (B 16) (Briggs et al. 1970; Schecter\net al. 2000).\nExamining (B 17) shows that this is exactly the equation satis\ufb01ed by the functions\nf (r) and g(r), and thus the solution for the normal mode is p=m\u03c9m and\n\u03a8L(r, p)= f (r, p). Now inverting (B 16) by deforming the contour around the\nsingularity at p=m\u03c9m only, we \ufb01nd that\nQm(t) = \u2212iR\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsf (s,m\u03c9m)\u03b6m(s, 0)\nm(\u03a9C(r) \u2212 \u03c9m) ds e\n\u2212im\u03c9mt , (B 18)\nwhere R is the residue at p=m\u03c9m,\nR = Res\np=m\u03c9m\n[\nlim\nr0\u2192\u221e\n(\n\u2212 ir\nm\n0\nf (r0, p)\n)]\n. (B 19)\nTo calculate Pm from this expression, we calculate Qm(0) for our initial condition\nZm(r) and we divide by Q\nNM\nm (0) for the normal mode, where \u03b6m(r, 0) is replaced by\ng(r) and the corresponding projection Pm =1 by de\ufb01nition. We \ufb01nd that\nQNMm (0) = iRrmI1, (B 20)\nand thus\nPm = \u2212I\u221211\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsf (s)Zm(s)\nmrm\u03a9\u02dcC(s)\nds, (B 21)\nwhere the contour of integration is bent above the singularity at rm given by\n\u03a9\u02dcC(rm)= 0. As we have bent the contour above the pole at rm, we can write the\nexpression for Pm as a principal value integral plus a contribution from the pole,\nPm = \u2212I\u221211\n(\nPV\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsf (s)Zm(s)\nmrm\u03a9\u02dcC(s)\nds \u2212 i\u03c0\nm\nZm(rm)\n\u03a9\u02dc \u2032C(rm)\n)\n. (B 22)\nHowever, we realize that the imaginary part here looks familiar: on its own, when\ninserted into \f in (B 13), it gives a term\n\u2212 i\u03c0\nm\nrmI1\u03a9\u02dc \u20322C (rm)\n\u00062Z\u20322S (rm)\n\u03b4Zm(rm). (B 23)\nFor m=2, this is precisely \u2212i\u03c0\/2 times the quantity \u0393 and what we are recovering\nis the initial delta-function forcing of the quasi-mode amplitude \f by the vorticity in\nthe critical layer, a quantity we disentangled in (2.15). This is a useful check, but to\navoid accounting for this twice, we delete the imaginary part of Pm to leave as our\n404 M. R. Turner and A. D. Gilbert\nde\ufb01nition\nPm = \u2212I\u221211 PV\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nsf (s)Zm(s)\nmrm\u03a9\u02dcC(s)\ndr. (B 24)\nwhich in the case of the Rankine vortex amounts to (2.8).\nREFERENCES\nBajer, K., Bassom, A. P. & Gilbert, A. D. 2001 Accelerated di\ufb00usion in the centre of a vortex.\nJ.
