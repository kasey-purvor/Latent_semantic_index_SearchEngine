The\nmain currents can, I think, be captured in terms of three broad schools of thought.\nLocke, and then the authors of The Federalist Papers, anticipate the growth of rights\nclaims against government, realised via divisions of powers and systematic representa-\ntion of the governed. Secondly, classical or economic liberals such as Adam Smith\nrespond to the rise of market relations, again understood as a sphere that can effec-\ntively limit governmental power. And third, modern egalitarian liberals such as Rawls\nrely on the greatly increased powers of modern societies to provide for welfare and\nprotect rights. He and his critics engage with the complexities of democratic participa-\ntion and huge difficulties posed by contested, competing values such as liberty and\nequality. These topics have been taken up in many further ways, for instance by\nrepublicanism, multiculturalism or feminism, which have stressed the space between\ndemocratic rights and actual participation, between formal equality and lived experi-\nence. Finally, perhaps we might also add a fourth current, with its roots in Hobbes: the\n\u2018liberalism of fear\u2019 reminds us of what we stand to lose when liberal democracy fails.\n208 G. Williams\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\nAll these schools of thought clearly draw on very important experiences. But one\nessential development seems to be omitted from this list, or any more detailed account.\nAs my title indicates, I believe this development can be captured in terms of the rise\nand rise of institutions. Modern societies are constituted by an astonishingly dense\nnetwork of organisations \u2014 private and public, social and economic, charitable and\npolitical, and so on.1 Naturally, contemporary liberals rely on this development to help\nrealise their normative aspirations. In this paper, however, I contend that this reliance\ntends to be tacit, which means it can easily be ignored when it suggests complexities in\nhow we should conceive of modern liberalism. My positive concern is to understand\nhow the practices of responsibility essential to modern liberal societies are actually\nconstituted.\nThree decades ago, Geoffrey Vickers observed \u2018two familiar but staggering changes\nof the last hundred years. One is the escalation of our expectations; the other is the\nescalation of our institutions\u2019. The term \u2018institution\u2019 describes here any organised\ncollectivity.2 We are familiar with an astonishingly wide range of such bodies: from\nschools to audit commissions to law courts, from the private limited company to the\npublic corporation to the transnational company, from the local charitable hospice to\nthe tennis club to the lavishly endowed charitable trust. To remain with Vickers for a\nmoment longer:\n. . . in Britain in the mid-nineteenth century trade unions were still criminal\nconspiracies; the right to form corporations, especially business corporations,\nwas a jealously guarded privilege; and the central government had only one\nrudimentary department concerned with any internal regulation beyond\njustice, law and order. The huge edifice of our institutions, like the huge edifice\nof our expectations, has been built within the lives of men alive today.3\nWe might say that modern liberal theory has had no difficulty keeping pace with our\nescalating expectations \u2014 one might even think it has done its share in contributing to\nthese. However, it has not done such a good job as regards our escalating institutions,\nso definitive of modern societies. Political and legal institutions are obviously import-\nant for liberal thought \u2014 as they have been for political theorists since Plato. But the\nmoral and political roles of institutions per se are much less regarded.4\nYet if we think about our modern expectations, it is not just political institutions or\nthe emergence of constitutional democracy that have satisfied and fuelled them. There\nare at least two further conditions that have realised our enormous expectations, whether\nthose concern tolerance and social pluralism, the balancing of governmental powers,\neconomic growth or growth in individual opportunities. One condition is technological,\nsomething that has been central to environmentalist political thought but has not been\nespecially important to liberalism. I too will put it to one side, in the belief that a\nsecond condition has been far more decisive.\nThis second development goes right to the fundamentals of human interaction. A\nwhole set of interrelated innovations that we might call \u2018technologies of organisation\u2019\nhas transformed our social and political lives. Among these innovations, one might\nmention division of labour, the invention and refinement of bureaucracy, the develop-\nment of modes of accountability, and massive legal innovations that accommodate\nand foster various collective entities (not least, the limited company). In fact, these\norganisational technologies have proved both a precondition of material technological\n\u2018Infrastructures of Responsibility\u2019 209\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\ninnovation and its systematic deployment \u2014 and much more important than any given\nmaterial technology in developing and meeting our modern expectations.\nAt the heart of these historically novel technologies of organisation are freely adopted,\ndeliberately created roles \u2014 as Vickers says, \u2018the greatest social invention of our culture\u2019,5\nalbeit an invention we usually take for granted. These are roles that can be adopted\nand renounced by individuals, roles whose occupants can be replaced, and roles which\ncan be deliberately designed or redesigned to meet particular needs or expectations.\nThis innovation belongs to both \u2018private\u2019 and \u2018public\u2019 sectors: it is a feature of govern-\nmental bodies, charities, political parties, trades unions, commercial entities, the regula-\ntory bodies that exist between government and market, and social organisations. (Total\ninstitutions obviously pose special problems here \u2014 the role of prisoner, for instance,\nis certainly not freely adopted. In fact, total institutions will also be problematic with\nregard to most of my following contentions. Note, however, in the open institutional\nfabric of liberal societies, total institutions are both distinctly atypical and particularly\nclosely hedged by legal and other safeguards.)6\nThe systematic deployment of this innovation, the freely adopted, deliberately created\nrole, is the correlate of the modern explosion of institutions. But why should this be\nnews to liberal theory? After all, the rise of contractual roles and relations is fundamental\nto economic liberalism. Democratic institutions likewise presuppose that individuals\nmight be elected to or ejected from political roles, and that these roles might be\nconstitutionally altered. Not least, equality of opportunity or the \u2018free choice of careers\nand occupations\u2019 (Rawls) would be meaningless without it. To clarify: My claim is not\nthe absurd one that liberalism has not relied on the emergence of institutions based on\nsuch roles, and the other \u2018technologies of organisation\u2019 that these make possible. My\nargument will rather be that it has failed to look at this development on its own terms,\nand therefore not appreciated its importance in realising the actual achievements of\nmodern liberal polities.\nI shall offer some suggestions in conclusion as to how this might have happened in\nsuch a diverse and thoughtful body of political theory. But one way to give this claim\nsome prima facie plausibility might be to recall a recurring charge against liberalism. It\nis often said, and not only by conservatives, that rights are correlate with responsibili-\nties.7 It is all very well, this line of thought may suggest, to emphasise liberal rights and\nindividual autonomy. But what assurance do we have that people will take care of their\nresponsibilities to one another? The greater the extent to which one endorses our\nmodern expectations, the harder it is to answer this doubt without hedging the indi-\nvidual\u2019s right to independently plan her own life.8 However, if one attends to the moral\nachievements of the institutional fabric in which we live, I believe there is no impasse\nhere. The freedoms we have most reason to value do not include the freedom to \u2018drop\nout\u2019; we will want to be able to leave behind particular associations if they prove\noppressive, but to be rid of all associations would be a deeply frightening prospect.\nMost of the time, what matters is the freedom to participate in ways that are meaning-\nful by one\u2019s own lights9 (and, we might add, compatible with the rights of others). The\nmoral tasks of our institutions, I will argue, can be summed up as opening such channels\nfor participation, and inculcating the responsibility that is both morally and practically its\nnecessary correlate. If this is correct, then our \u2018freedom\u2019 can indeed be squared with the\nvery weighty demands for responsibility that correspond to the very high expectations\nthat we have of our social order.\n210 G. Williams\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\nTo make this argument, I describe three moral tasks which institutions should, and\nvery often do, play. My task is thus both descriptive and normative. On the one hand,\nI want to understand how it is that liberal polities are able to go so far in meeting our\nconsiderable expectations of them. On the other, insofar as we admire and value those\nachievements, to emphasise how they are made possible also has a prescriptive aspect.\nIf some of our institutions fail to perform these tasks, then that should be a matter of\nmoral and political concern. My discussion of these tasks will be relatively brief and\nschematic: although we rarely, I suggest, take proper theoretical account of them, we\ndo tend to be very familiar with these tasks on a day-to-day level.\nOne final introductory note: Underpinning my argument is the following thought:\nthat normative liberal theory tends to overplay the significance of individual autonomy\nand thus \u2014 something less often noticed \u2014 to underplay the costs and dangers of nor-\nmative disagreement. It is this, I believe, that makes it plausible to neglect the structur-\ning power of social and economic, as well as political, institutions \u2014 a structuring that\nis essential if individual autonomy is to be meaningfully and responsibly realised.\nI believe that an emphasis upon the importance of our institutions still supports, in\nevery respectable sense of the word, a liberal vision \u2014 but it will be a liberalism better\ngrounded both in contemporary realities and in the enduring realities of our actual\nmoral agency.\nInfrastructure (i): Inculcating Practical Moralities\nThe first task I will sketch concerns how institutions provide practical moralities for all\nthose they involve, and why this is itself of immense moral value. This does not involve\nthe claim that we all adopt all the values of the institutions we belong to, still less that\nevery institution or role embodies a defensible morality. It is rather to claim that\nactivity and its evaluation are thoroughly structured by roles and institutions, in ways\nthat are indeed morally important \u2014 and important not simply by virtue of the particu-\nlar practical moralities concerned. This claim is meant to allow for there being cases\nwhere this structuring takes place in undesirable ways \u2014 the danger of corrupt institu-\ntions.10 But this possibility does not imply that structuring itself is unimportant \u2014\nrather that reform of roles or institutions, or both, would then be necessary, so that\nactivity and judgment are better structured.\n How do institutions provide us with practical moralities? The most important\naspects lie in their structuring of judgment and action via rules, roles and relation-\nships.11 In the first place, roles involve the acceptance of responsibility. Roles are usually\nadopted with consent, which is vital not only from the point of view of individual\nrights, but also because roles of any depth involve responsibilities whose fulfilment\ncannot be effectively coerced, because they require the actor\u2019s on-going thought, com-\nmitment and initiative. The content of those responsibilities is, however, largely de-\nfined by the role and the rules and expectations associated with it. In the institutional\ncontext, moreover, we relate to others who have responsibilities for ensuring that we\nunderstand these expectations. This is partly a case of constraining the actor to fulfil\nthem, but it is just as much a case of enabling him to fulfil them, through resources\nsuch as authority and information. In an ideal world, and to some significant degree in\nthe real world of functioning liberal societies, roles combine incentives of self-interest,\n\u2018Infrastructures of Responsibility\u2019 211\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\nactors\u2019 own moral expectations of themselves, and responsible contributions to others\u2019\nneeds or legitimate aims.\n In these ways, many questions of human cooperation are pre-judged. Such\npractical settlements are not open to contestation in the same way as the purportedly\n\u2018shared values\u2019 that theorists often suppose to be crucial for human cooperation. Even\nwhen we agree on the ends, after all, dispute about the means can wreck everything.\nPractically speaking, however, nothing succeeds like success: if all are able to see that\nthings are working, roles, rules, moralities do not need to be revisited or disputed. If\nactors perceive fewer problems (whether at macro or micro levels) then they have\nmuch less cause to fall in with the stories of blame and calls for punitive action that\nhelp make normative disagreement so dangerous. (Thus the truism that intolerance\nand scapegoating are much more prevalent in times of economic difficulty.) Mutual\ntrust and shared loyalty are secured, not primarily by shared \u2018values\u2019 or \u2018identities,\u2019 but\nby the actual experience of successful and relatively fair cooperation.12\nThis may be granted, but there is still the question: why should the (provisional)\ndefinition and enforcement of a relatively specific morality be of moral value, even\nto some extent regardless of the content of that agreement? Is this not already to part\ncompany with every liberal who wishes to stress the value of individual autonomy, of\nexercising our own moral judgment? Two reasons are important.\nIn the first place, \u2018getting it right\u2019 is not the only value.13 Given the sheer complexity\nand difficulty of human cooperation there is important value in agreement simply as\nsuch. Any individual normative judgment has the potential to disturb practical agree-\nment, in ways that endanger trust, mutual loyalty, and cooperation. This is as true of\nprudential and expertise-related judgments as it is of moral, religious, ideological and\nidentity-based ones. To acknowledge this is not to indulge in an illiberal yearning for\nuniversal agreement. At this institutional, role-based level, what is at stake is a limited,\ndelimited and often provisional sort of agreement that liberals too can (and should)\nvalue. Such a morality defines only one part of an individual\u2019s life and conduct. By\ntheir nature these practical moralities are exposed to a vital check, of not being in\nsignificant conflict with the moralities involved in other spheres of a person\u2019s life. And\nsuch agreement should not be seen as merely constraining: in permitting certain sorts\nof cooperation, it has a strong enabling aspect. Moreover, as I will stress in the next\nsection, such agreement represents a precondition for exercising individual initiative so\nas to effect meaningful change.\nSecond, \u2018getting it right\u2019 is difficult and asks too much of us. In extremis we must\nhope that people will fall back on some basic moral certainties (for example, not to\nparticipate in organised murder). But we know people have often failed even in that.\nWe know (we should know) that individual moral reflection is extremely fragile; that\nwe are fundamentally dependent on social context for guidance; that most of us find it\nimpossible to live with norms that don\u2019t vindicate our own conduct; that we need\nvalues that lend meaning to our own lives. Values, like identities, are things we do;\nand what we find ourselves doing shapes our values and alters our identities. We often\nhear liberals (and communitarian critics) talking of values as if they might antecede,\nor survive untouched by, our engagements with the institutions of modern societies.\nWhen our values do change, this then appears as either a matter of manipulative,\nautonomy-undermining influence or of rarefied, rational dialogue about those values.\nBut this is surely an unrealistic way of characterising individuals\u2019 values and identities\n212 G. Williams\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\n\u2014 and most unhelpful for understanding the processes by which they do become\nsufficiently coordinated to provide for peaceful coexistence, mutual tolerance, and\nactive cooperation. I will say some more about this in discussing the multiplicity of our\naffiliations, below.\nInfrastructure (ii): Allocations of Responsibility, Initiative, Power\nThe first point concerned how institutions define agreed moralities, and the moral\nimportance of this agreement. I now wish to emphasise the differentiation that is\nnecessarily introduced by any institution, by virtue of the fact that it allocates different\nresponsibilities to distinct individuals. As well as creating nets of mutual expectations,\ninstitutions create and adjudicate separate spheres of initiative.\nOne result of these processes is certainly familiar to liberalism, especially as\ninfluenced by rational choice theory. One crucial role of institutions is to provide\nsolutions to coordination problems. It is no news that they can generate massive\ncoordination achievements \u2014 welfare, stability, mutual guarantees. In rational choice\napproaches, the characteristic moral problems are taken to be those of \u2018free-riding\u2019 by\nself-interested agents, and variations on the \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019. Institutions\nthen enter the fray as means to promote coordination by providing mutual assurances\nand altering incentive structures. Rational choice issues are obviously of moral as well\nas prudential importance, if one agrees that cooperation represents an important value\nin its own right. By limiting options for choice and thereby effectively shaping agents\u2019\npreferences, by creating patterns of reliable activity that mean one agent can count on\nanother, by providing resources to guarantee various sorts of \u2018exchanges\u2019: in all these\nways institutions are key.\nBut institutions\u2019 coordinating powers have further moral dimensions, less often\nappreciated. I would like to bring out two in particular: (i) How institutions provide\nfor a background or \u2018working\u2019 consensus against which disagreements can be dealt\nwith; (ii) How they separate powers and responsibilities, creating distinct spheres of\nresponsibility and initiative. These two aspects flow back and forth into each other: one\npart of what gets accepted is who has responsibility or authority with regard to certain\nchoices; resolving many disagreements involves allocating or reallocating such powers.\nIn the first place, functional institutions are not simply stable but draw on their\nmembers\u2019 capacity to initiate change. Provisional agreement on ways of doing things\nwill incorporate some accepted ways of dealing with disagreement that do not disturb\non-going cooperation. Thus part of the shared morality discussed in the first section\nconcerns agreed ways of negotiating decision, change and disagreement. This means\nthat disagreements can be dealt with without the costs and dangers of unmanaged\nconflict.14 Consider the example of a committee member. In normal circumstances \u2014\nwhere neither individual nor organisation is failing \u2014 she is neither simply \u2018an indi-\nvidual\u2019 nor \u2018one with\u2019 the committee.15 She accepts that this is a forum for decision-\nmaking, that she has a responsibility within it, that she has a right to contribute as well\nas a duty as regards the collective decision, whether it represented her view or not.\nThis example might also remind us that roles are not just about rules. At the least\nthey involve interpreting those rules; at mid- and higher levels of responsibility, indi-\nviduals are expected to respond creatively to their roles \u2014 to exercise both autonomy\n\u2018Infrastructures of Responsibility\u2019 213\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\nand responsibility. This initiative, coupled with the deliberate creation of roles, enables\ninstitutions to be responsive to change or unmet responsibilities. Actors may renegoti-\nate their own role or that of others, create new roles, even found new institutions.\nTrue as it is that institutions often blinker their members to unmet responsibilities, it is\nequally the case that only organisations can provide for the stability and the organised\ndecision-making that are needed for deliberate change.\nA further aspect of this first task lies in reducing and delimiting the need or demand\nfor moral(ised) discourse.16 I have already spoken of the importance of practical success\nin reducing the need for individual judgment, in enabling practical agreement. In\nrelation to organisations\u2019 divisions of responsibility, this is important inasmuch as we\nfeel less need to interfere in others\u2019 areas of judgment and action.17 Being able to count\non others\u2019 courses of action reduces the need for \u2018contingency planning\u2019 to an extent\nthat can hardly be overestimated. Experience and relevant expertise accumulate over\ntime, reducing one\u2019s own and others\u2019 uncertainty about one\u2019s capacity to fulfil the role,\nin turn reducing legitimate scope for interference and the scope and import of norma-\ntive disagreement.\nThis brings us to a second moral dimension of institutions\u2019 coordinating powers:\nhow practical agreement and effective cooperation are enabled by distributing respons-\nibilities among agents and between agencies. Institutions allocate spheres of respons-\nibility in a two-fold sense. Individuals are allocated particular responsibilities by their\norganisations, while institutions themselves have their own tasks and concerns.\nWithin institutions, individuals are obviously allocated distinct spheres of responsibility.\nThis is morally important because responsibility is correlative with initiative and power.\nIndividuals are enabled, empowered and recognised, matters of great importance to\npeople\u2019s sense of self and responsibility even when it concerns things which outsiders\nmight judge quite trivial. Individuals have some responsibility that is not identical to\nanyone else\u2019s, and ideally one that does not conflict severely with another\u2019s. At the\nsame time, it is not a total responsibility. Others have responsibilities for other aspects\nof the same matter. We have responsibilities to communicate, negotiate and inform.\nOthers check and hold accountable. For example, if we have particular responsibility\nto provide for an incapacitated person\u2019s health care, others have responsibilities as\nregards their housing; and other have responsibilities for checking on the care we provide.\nResponsibility that is overseen or borders on other responsibilities does not thereby\nbecome nugatory; it does become more manageable, and its fulfilment more sure.\nPerhaps even more important, separation of responsibilities means that the level of\nreflection and responsibility demanded of any one individual is considerably reduced.\nSome affairs, outcomes, issues aren\u2019t one\u2019s responsibility, having been assigned to\nanother agent or agency; and responsibility for many more issues is shared with others.\nAnd this is crucial, because people who are over-loaded tend to drastically simplify\ntheir sense of responsibility, both so that their tasks are made manageable and so that\nthey do not have to see themselves as failing in their duties. We know that the manager\nwho is expected to be responsible for safety as well as profit will too often forget about\nsafety. With a safety officer to check up on him, and a regulatory agency to control\nsafety standards, we can reasonably hope for a happier result.\nAs this example suggests, we divide responsibilities between, as well as within,\ninstitutions. Politically speaking, of course, some institutions will have much more\nimportant tasks than others. But this does not mean that we should attend only to\n214 G. Williams\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\nthose institutions of obvious political importance. One reason for this was emphasised\nby classical liberals, when they stressed the importance of spheres of activity not\ncontrolled by the state \u2014 thus the \u2018free market\u2019. Even if modern day liberals tend to be\nless sanguine about markets and more optimistic about governmental activity, the basic\npoint remains important. We want to divide responsibilities, ensuring that there is\nslack in the system, that different bodies can check one another, that individuals have\ndifferent places to turn (or run) to. While I find that many liberal theorists place more\nweight on individual rights as a check to government and a means to social participa-\ntion than they should, and less weight on plural organisations (a point that was brought\nout in debates about civil society)18 the importance of divided powers rightly remains\nan important liberal theme. Appropriately, openness, accountability and mutual\noversight are attracting renewed attention \u2014 especially as we find that some forms\nof oversight are meddling and intrusive, and may undercut an organisation\u2019s proper\ninitiative with regard to its responsibilities.19 But for all that such processes are rarely\nstraightforward and can go awry, mechanisms of accountability are crucial to the\nopenness of an institutional fabric, and to seeing that different organisations each\nembody defensible moralities.\nSome time ago Karl Popper described \u2018piecemeal engineering\u2019 as the basis of\nthe open society.20 \u2018Institutional division of responsibility\u2019 is both the condition and the\nsubject of such engineering. Sometimes, of course, responsibilities fall through the\ncracks \u2014 especially for those who lack meaningful participation in the overall fabric of\nour institutions, for instance those living outside the borders of liberal states. It was in\nthis context that Samuel Scheffler coined my title phrase, \u2018infrastructures of respons-\nibility\u2019 \u2014 how communities and institutional frameworks supply \u2018individuals with a\nreasonably clear statement of their responsibilities and encourage the development of\nthe motivations that will lead them to discharge those responsibilities\u2019.21 A basic reality\nof the modern world is that unmet responsibilities will not be addressed by individual\ninitiatives, except insofar as those initiatives combine to found or restructure institu-\ntions.22 In turn, one crucial feature of the open society is that individuals and organisa-\ntions are empowered to pick up and deal with unmet responsibilities.\nIn sum: our institutional fabric frames responsibility, power and initiative, for indi-\nviduals and for organisations, providing a background of practical agreement that is the\nsine qua non for fruitfully tackling disagreement. While enabling actors or organisa-\ntions to fulfil certain duties, this fabric equally prevents them from disregarding their\nresponsibilities or pursuing others\u2019 responsibilities. By offering, recognising, delimiting\nchannels to participate in the commonweal, institutions prevent us from being con-\nfronted with a plethora of moral tasks with no idea who might tackle which, with\nboundless responsibilities and a pernicious licence to interfere wherever we judge fit.\nThus Bradley\u2019s dictum, \u2018my station and its duties\u2019: a dictum we should not scorn, but\nonly qualify by observing that in modern societies we create and renegotiate both\nstations and duties as a matter of course.\nInfrastructure (iii): Recognition and Identities\nThis is to argue that institutions embody working moral agreements that are them-\nselves morally important, that they permit significant coordination achievements via\n\u2018Infrastructures of Responsibility\u2019 215\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\ntheir divisions of responsibility and systems of mutual oversight, that they provide both\nfor stability and deliberate change. I now wish to focus on a fact so far only alluded\nto: that in a liberal polity, we each have a plurality of allegiances, being members of\nseveral institutions and, indeed, other forms of association. Moreover, some of these\nmemberships, though not all, will reflect our own choices and ride on our continued\nconsent. The result is, we might say, practical training in moral pluralism, as we\nnegotiate identities and renegotiate affiliations in order to make sense of our multiple\ncommitments.23\nWe already saw one crucial way in which institutions, even the most mundane, are\nimportant in recognising individuals \u2014 something that is surely a crucial condition for\nthe decent exercise of moral agency. Insofar as our institutional roles grant us some\nsphere of responsibility, they recognise us as contributors to the projects with which\nthey are bound up.24 Likewise, we encounter others in distinct, relatively well-defined\ncapacities or relations, rather than simply as individuals as such. That is to say, we\nmeet others with a definite and restricted responsibility toward them, so that we are\noriented by specific sorts of concern for them and extend them a certain sort of\nconsideration or recognition \u2014 and do not try to compass their entire identity.\nOf course, there are many roles where these elements fail. Some roles deny respect,\nor even humiliate \u2014 as Avishai Margalit stressed in reformulating the liberal project as\nthat of \u2018the decent society\u2019.25 One can hardly deny that such misrecognition is common\nenough in liberal states. It is well known, for instance, to many \u2018clients\u2019 of welfare state\ninstitutions, or amongst many employees subject to bad management. (As these\nexamples may indicate, such nugatory recognition is often correlated with the denial of\nindividual scope for legitimate initiative.) Our most worthwhile roles accord respons-\nibilities, particular spheres of answerability, albeit rather limited ones with narrowly\ndefined scope to judge or interfere in others\u2019 thought or conduct. And even where the\ndegree of initiative is vanishingly small, our roles may provide us with some sense of\nsolidarity with our peers, that is, their recognition of us \u2014 the saving grace of many\nworkplaces, for example.\nThe crucial point, however, is that \u2014 in a liberal institutional fabric \u2014 we belong to\na plurality of institutions, and can, to a varying extent, choose our affiliations. In this\ncase, it matters less if some affiliations cast us in somewhat humbling roles, so long as\nwe do not experience systematic humiliation (especially not the humiliation of me and\nmy kind at the hands of them, an obvious crystallising factor for sectarian conflict). To\nhave a sense of ourselves as responsible agents, as persons who can be trusted and\nwhose judgment others can rely on, hardly requires thorough-going recognition in all\nspheres of life. If we move amid a plurality of affiliations, having some say in those we\nadopt, and if the institutions we have no choice about are not systematically humiliat-\ning, then we can expect the respect and recognition so important for responsible\nagency. Equally, our interactions are structured in ways that lead us to recognise others\nas fellow participants in many different spheres of life.\nThe multiplicity of affiliation and absence of group-based humiliations is especially\nimportant when we think of the exclusionary, centrifugal dangers of identity and\ngroup-based politics. It is an old point, recently less emphasised, that multiple loyalties\nare crucial for toleration, for coexistence amid difference. They make it much more\ndifficult to maintain, and much less tempting to reach for, that most dangerous illu-\nsion: that one possesses some well-formed idea of \u2018the good\u2019. They represent, as I have\n216 G. Williams\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\nput it, practical training in moral pluralism: they expose us to competing loyalties, to\na diverse set of duties that are \u2014 so far as we indeed live among the institutions\nschematised here \u2014 not \u2018irreconcilable\u2019 but rather in tension, in need of being kept\nseparate, and partial by their very nature. That is to say, in the idiom of one important\nset of institutions: these duties may be weighty, but characteristically they are \u2018just a\njob,\u2019 not an overriding existential imperative.\nOne objection often faced by liberals in debates about multiculturalism is that they\nwould relegate \u2018difference\u2019 to the private sphere. It may be thought that my account is\nvulnerable to this objection too. It would not be unreasonable to interpret an emphasis\non roles and institutions as suggesting the following picture: That we appear to each\nother in various impersonal capacities in our institutions, and that we enjoy more limited\nassociations with those who we share a sense of \u2018community\u2019 \u2014 families, religious\nbodies, et cetera. In part I would want to concede the charge, with the claim that there\ncan be positive value in privatising difference. If we won\u2019t agree about some things,\nthen let\u2019s keep them to areas where we won\u2019t fall over each other, so far as that proves\nacceptable and practicable. This is to claim that there is no disvalue in modus vivendi\nsolutions; part of my line of thought, indeed, is that it is wrong-headed to draw any\nstrong line between \u2018principled\u2019 political settlements and \u2018expedient\u2019 social arrange-\nments.26 Both have costs and benefits, and pose their own risks when pursued or obtained;\nboth involve negotiations and areas of silence; both, in any case, act on people\u2019s values\nand identities because, as I have wanted to stress, these are things we do.\nNonetheless, none of the solutions multiculturalists have propounded are closed to\nan account that emphasises the importance of our institutional affiliations. The key\nproviso is only that our theorising does not hypostatise identities or communities into\nsome unitary, authentic moral whole. The language of competing \u2018conceptions of the\ngood\u2019 seems to me to do precisely this.27 Sectarians and bigots may think they have a\n\u2018conception of the good,\u2019 as may someone in the grip of a particular theoretical worldview\n(some formulations of both liberalism and communitarianism, for instance). But decent\npeople in decent circumstances muddle through, compromising between the different\nthings they feel reason to value. And part of \u2018muddling through\u2019 consists in appearing\nto each other in different aspects in the different contexts we move between. Many\nmodern ways of speaking imply that our different roles, or the presentation of different\naspects of ourselves to different audiences, involve some \u2018inauthentic persona\u2019 or a\nfalsification of a \u2018real self \u2019, that compromises some pre-existing identity or our \u2018auto-\nnomy\u2019. But this ignores how essential our various roles are to our self-conceptions, to\nwhat sense of \u2018identity\u2019 we do have. It takes too little account of the political processes\nof fear and mistrust by which people can be led to stake totalising identity claims,\nwhere before there was effective coexistence.28 Not least, it spells doom for successful\nco-existence should we fail to find sufficient \u2018overlap\u2019 in our various \u2018conceptions of the\ngood\u2019.\nWe might interpret, then, an effective plurality of institutions, which channels plural\nforms of mutual recognition, as the effective realisation of norms of toleration. In the\nworking liberal polity we could reconstrue Rawls\u2019s figure of \u2018overlapping consensus\u2019\nthus: a huge set of diverse, interacting and mutually reinforcing \u2018mini-consensuses\u2019\nbetween individuals who recognise each other \u2014 and identify themselves \u2014 in terms of\na variety of different capacities and roles. The individuals involved may see the overall\nsettlement in many different terms; most of them, in all probability, will give it hardly\n\u2018Infrastructures of Responsibility\u2019 217\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\na second thought. It is one of the great achievements of liberalism, indeed, that they\nhave no need to reflect on this settlement, having already been enabled to get on with\ntheir lives and fulfil their responsibilities to one another.\nConclusion\nLiberalism is notoriously difficult to define and continues to be theorised by many\nmajor thinkers in diverse ways. It is certain that the moral tasks and concerns raised\nhere are at least partly addressed by this body of thought. This suggests a prima facie\nimplausibility to my overall argument. Perhaps I should have asked sooner: what reason\ncould there be for thinking that such a wide-ranging and important theoretical school\nsuffers from this alleged institutional blind spot? I think a series of factors may explain\ntheorists\u2019 relative neglect of the structuring role of institutions, social and economic as\nwell as political.\nFirst, a certain ideational bias, for want of a better term: a tendency to focus on people\u2019s\nexplicitly held beliefs and values, rather than their actual practices and contexts of\naction. This may be what is called a \u2018professional deformation\u2019: as theorists our stock\nin trade is concepts, values, justifications. It is all too easy to write in ways which suggest\na greater role for these than they play in everyday life, or which disembody them,\npicturing a layer of reflection or self-conceptions above the material, mundane level of\n\u2018self-interest\u2019. In real life discussions, however, we know that values and practices are\nincredibly hard to disentangle, and that explicitly moral discussion is as often a recipe\nfor self-deception and polarisation as it is for constructive debate.\nThis relates, second, to a tendency among many liberals to be too optimistic about\nthe normative disagreement, and its risks and costs \u2014 despite liberalism\u2019s important\nemphasis on the coexistence of different ways of life. As some advocates of \u2018modus vivendi\u2019\nand \u2018liberalism of fear\u2019 approaches have argued, the picture tends to be of people\narguing about \u2018alternative conceptions of the good\u2019 or \u2018the nature of the good life\u2019. But\nour experience of the \u2018fact of pluralism\u2019 is, especially outside of liberal polities, much\nmore mixed than this \u2014 in large part, because the \u2018good lives\u2019 concerned are crucial to\nthe meaningfulness of people\u2019s lived experiences.29 If that meaningfulness is felt to be\nunder threat, then \u2018difference\u2019 becomes exceedingly dangerous.\nA third factor one might mention is a sort of \u2018legalism\u2019 that ascribes an unrealistic\nsovereignty to the state and its laws, and neglects the crucial role of actual practices\nand institutions in constituting a social and political order. One interesting version of\nthis charge owes to Foucault and theorists of \u2018governmentality,\u2019 such as Nikolas Rose.\nRose observes: \u2018Liberal government, dependent as it is upon the orchestrations of\nthe actions of independent entities, is inherently risky \u2014 and no more so than in its\nreliance upon those who are able to mobilise around the power to speak the truth and\nthe capacity to act knowledgeably upon conduct\u2019.30 To be sure, this does sound like\nan immensely fragile balancing act, much more complex than the simplified \u2018state\nguarantees rights\u2019 story that we often assume. But a different slant might be put on the\nmatter, if we think of the multiply interlinked web of agents and agencies pictured\nhere. Given the variety and extent of the expertise that is thereby coordinated and\nenlisted, the multiple sources of power that check and balance, the willingness to take\nresponsibility that are brought together, one may think that we have discovered a\n218 G. Williams\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\nparticularly powerful and enabling form of government. And the evidence surely speaks\nto this side of the story, too.\nFinally, and most obviously: no one can forget the danger of corrupt institutions.\nNot just the greatest benefits but also, with the partial and important exception of civil\nconflict, the greatest harms have been institutionalised. When we think of mass murder,\nfor example, we inevitably picture Eichmann, archetype of organisation man amid evil\norganisations. More mundanely, we might think of testimony from those who have \u2018blown\nthe whistle\u2019 on corporate or bureaucratic or military wrongdoing. Here we certainly\nwant to stress the importance of individual moral reflection, and disavow the immoral\npower of institutions.31 The question, however, is what this disavowal should mean in\npractice. The reality is that few do speak out; more, in the case of a corrupt institu-\ntional fabric, speaking out is almost certainly useless. What is most important, I would\nsuggest, is a relative openness to our institutions. An emphasis on the moral value of\ninstitutions only neglects the dangers of corrupt institutions if it ignores the importance\nof this openness.\nNow, the openness of our institutions is clearly a huge topic in its own right; indeed,\nrecalling Popper\u2019s \u2018open society\u2019, one might frame the whole liberal project in such\nterms. But it may be useful to point up how important this has been to my descriptive-\ncum-normative account. Above all, openness involves checks between institutions,\nchecks that are mutual and overlapping and rarely straightforwardly hierarchical.\nResponsibilities and the exercise of these responsibilities are made matters of scrutiny,\nof formal and informal accountability. Thus responsibilities breached or neglected can\nbe challenged, addressed, taken up. As well as rights to found new associations, this\nrelies on real and effective opportunities to speak out with regard to organisations\u2019\nactivities and their goals. Likewise, we are familiar with the importance of real and\neffective options for exit, which exist for many of the associations and institutions to\nwhich we belong. Of course, this is not always feasible, political membership being the\nmost obvious example. In such a case, it is natural to think that the institution must\nmeet rather higher standards to be legitimate. Corporations can severely restrict their\nmembers\u2019 knowledge of and participation in many aspects of their running, and both\nworkers and customers should (at least) be able to leave. States, on the other hand, are\nrightly constrained by formal democratic rights and institutions dedicated to monitor-\ning and protecting these.\nWe can sum up openness, then, in the terms so nicely contrasted by Hirschman.32\nFor each organisational affiliation, our loyalty is conditional; there exists scope for\nvoice; usually exit will also be an option. Abilities to contribute, to speak out, and to\nleave provide a vital check on the internal moralities of organisations; without them,\nthe hope that we can find a productive tension \u2014 and not outright contradictions \u2014\nbetween the moralities of our various memberships becomes merely pious. In each\ncase, however, note that other organisations enable our rights to contribute, to speak\nout, to leave.\nAll these points and more have received great thought and attention, if not always by\nliberal theorists, then certainly by all those caught up in the unending work of institut-\ning a liberal social fabric. Against the emphasis of liberal theorists, I want only to stress\nthat, to prevent corrupt institutions, and the corrupt individual moralities that result, our\nsolutions must be themselves institutional, first and foremost. The worse things are,\nthe more we will want the sort of responsible moral judgment that liberalism typically\n\u2018Infrastructures of Responsibility\u2019 219\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\nvalues so highly \u2014 and the less likely we are to get it. Amid the comforts of our\nfunctioning institutions, it is all too easy to forget that responsible agency is very largely\nan achievement of those same institutions.\nTo conclude: I suggest this view of institutions and the problems they help us to\nsolve is congruent with concerns that lead liberals to emphasise values such as tolera-\ntion or neutrality, autonomy or individual rights. But it is based on the belief that these\nvalues are much less matters of discursive or theoretical agreement than of institution-\nalised practice. What really counts is not how people talk about the right or the good,\nbut practical mechanisms which structure how they experience and fulfil their respons-\nibilities to one another. Within an open institutional fabric people pursue neither\nsupposedly coherent conceptions of the good, nor unjustly compelled compromises\nof such conceptions, more likely to build up resentments than to foster coexistence.\nThese people won\u2019t agree about many of the things they choose to reflect on, and they\nwon\u2019t need to reflect on many other things besides. And all this seems to me just as\nwell, if we keep in mind that the costs of unstructured participation, uninformed\ndebate, and unmediated disagreement can be very grave indeed.\nGarrath Williams, Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, Lancaster University, Lancaster\nLA1 4YG, UK. g.d.williams@lancaster.ac.uk\nAcknowledgements\nFor comments and discussions on this paper, I would like to thank Bob Brecher,\nMargaret Canovan, Tim Chappell, Eve Garrard, Morris Kaplan, colleagues at Lancas-\nter University (especially John O\u2019Neill and Alan Holland), Mairi Levitt, and partici-\npants at the Northern Political Theory Association\u2019s conference at the University of\nEdinburgh, August 2002.

She suggests\nthat the achievements of liberalism have depended, much more than liberal theorists usually allow, upon\nthe resources of nationhood: \u2018the discourses of liberalism, social justice and democratic theory rely upon\ntacit assumptions about the existence of political community\u2019 (p. 44), especially the mobilisations of power\nthat nationhood makes possible. My argument intersects with hers for those cases where nations are\nconstituted as states, i.e. as a set of mutually checking and mutually enabling institutions, which do indeed\nmobilise power to an extraordinary degree.\n2 For my purposes, no particular distinction is made between \u2018institutions\u2019 and \u2018organisations.\u2019 This usage\ntherefore excludes one sociological use of the term, when a settled practice such as promising or marriage\nis described as an institution.\n3 G. Vickers, Making Institutions Work (London: Associated Business Programmes, 1973), pp. 11, 13.\n4 One obvious exception is Michael Walzer, Spheres of Justice: A Defence of Pluralism and Equality (New York:\nBasic Books, 1983). However, Walzer\u2019s argument concerns the particular roles played by different sorts of\ninstitutions, whereas I am concerned with the common tasks fulfilled by all the institutions that co-exist in\na liberal polity. Our arguments do, however, overlap considerably when it comes to the importance of a\nplurality of institutions, each with their own proper sphere that needs to be continually negotiated against\nthe boundaries of others. Cf. also Charles Taylor, \u2018Atomism\u2019 in his Philosophy and the Human Sciences:\nPhilosophical Papers 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 205ff.\n220 G. Williams\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\n5 Vickers op. cit., p. 29.\n6 I speak of an \u2018open institutional fabric\u2019 because I do not wish to imply that liberalism demands openness\nof all institutions, even allowing for the exception of prisons, asylums and so on. Many organisations are\nclosed in the sense that their membership is limited by religion, sexuality, geography and so on, something\nno liberal need disapprove of. On \u2018openness\u2019 see further my conclusion, below.\n7 Among contemporary political theorists this basic point has been strongly pursued by Onora O\u2019Neill, for\ninstance Towards Justice and Virtue (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997). O\u2019Neill also argues\nthat we need to accord an important role to institutions in defining duties and realising rights. See also my\nreview article \u2018Understanding the wrongs we do together\u2019, Res Publica 8 (2002).\n8 One plausible way out of this problem might be found in incentive structures that reward those\nwho contribute most to the stock of goods, services, and powers that will enable us to provide decent\nopportunities to all. My reservation here lies in the presupposition that incentives can be clearly separated\nfrom the values of those who pursue them, i.e. the idea that an incentive structure is not problematic from\na liberal point of view, because it is does not make assumptions about people\u2019s moral values, or interfere\nwith their moral autonomy. But people prefer to pursue incentives they think are worthwhile \u2014 and if they\nare made to pursue non-worthwhile incentives, often come to alter their ideas of what is worthwhile. That\nis, we seem inevitably to link the idea of reward with desert. From my perspective, this is not problematic\nin itself (everything would hinge on the detailed workings of the incentive structure). But it is difficult to\nsee how it could fit with a commitment to neutrality or to an autonomy-based perfectionism, to name two\nprominent strands of contemporary liberal theory.\n9 I will say some more below, about the fact that our modes of valuing are reflexively related to our\naffiliations and activities \u2014 so that our moral preferences are to some extent \u2018adaptive\u2019.\n10 Obviously, there are many cases where agreement enables harms and wrongs to be organised, from the\nMafia\u2019s code of silence to the Catholic bishops who sought to avoid scandal by shielding paedophile\npriests. (I thank Margaret Canovan for these examples and pressing this point.) My argument might be\nput this way: institutionalised agreement is a sine qua non of fruitful human coexistence, as it is for\nconstructively tackling disagreements; so too, it can also permit and foster great harms. On the other hand,\nsheer disagreement can only generate harms and costs. My conclusion points to some ways in which the\nopenness of a liberal institutional fabric limits the dangers of corrupt institutions.\n11 Thus Dorothy Emmet\u2019s valuable study, Rules, Roles and Relations (London: Macmillan, 1966).\n12 Claus Offe nicely summarises the dual aspect of functional fitness and normative attachment, drawing on\nextensive literature in social theory: \u2018Designing institutions in East European transitions\u2019, in R. Goodin\n(ed.) The Theory of Institutional Design (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996).\n13 Cheshire Calhoun usefully stresses that \u2018getting it right\u2019 is not the only moral goal, and that we must also\naim at \u2018mutual agreement to a scheme of social cooperation\u2019 \u2014 which, as she says, goes against the usual\nassumptions of moral philosophers: \u2018Moral failure\u2019, in C. Card (ed.) On Feminist Ethics and Politics\n(Lawrence, KA: University Press of Kansas, 1999), p. 93.\n14 Russell Hardin (1996) incorporates a strong sense of the idiosyncrasy and damaging variability in norma-\ntive judgment into his case for going beyond individual or ad hoc to \u2018institutional morality\u2019 (in an essay of\nthat name, in Goodin (ed.), op. cit.: esp. 141ff. Dennis Thompson also makes such a case: \u2018The institu-\ntional turn in professional ethics\u2019, Ethics and Behaviour 9 (1999).\n15 I thank Bob Brecher for the example and this way of putting it.\n16 Cf. Robert Goodin, one liberal thinker who has taken institutions very seriously. Goodin defends his claim\nthat \u2018acting upon moral principles usually works out to the good\u2019 by saying that opponents of this claim\nhave in mind moralising (inflexible, intolerant), not \u2018moral,\u2019 approaches to politics: Motivating Political\nMorality (Cambridge, MA: Blackwell, 1992), pp. 165ff. I should prefer to say that, so far as this nice\ndistinction has any practical purchase, this hangs on institutional frameworks that successfully channel and\ndelimit normative claims.\n17 Of course, there is an important question here about the accuracy of our perceptions: if inaccurate, we\nmay face needless contention or succumb to misplaced complacency.\n18 What exactly \u2018civil society\u2019 covers has been much disputed: it is now usually taken to be that sphere of\nassociation outside of state and market, and sometimes even the subset of these associations that is not\nformally instituted. Being concerned with the roles performed by all the coexisting institutions in a liberal\npolity, I leave this definitional issue aside.\n19 Onora O\u2019Neill\u2019s recent work is especially notable: e.g. A Question of Trust (BBC Reith lectures, 2002,\nwww.bbc.co.uk\/radio4).\n\u2018Infrastructures of Responsibility\u2019 221\n\u00a9 Society for Applied Philosophy, 2006\n20 K.

Rosenblum valu-\nably brings out how complex and variegated the experience and effects of associations can be, arguing that\nwe should attach particular importance to the openness and shifting nature of associational life.\n24 At the same time institutions also largely define the criteria by which agents compete for more elevated\nstatus.

Although to subordinate all our aims to one end does not strictly speaking violate the principles\nof rational choice . . . it still strikes us as irrational, or more likely as mad. The self is disfigured and put\nin the service of one of its ends for the sake of system\u2019, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972) p. 554.\nAll I would add is that such a move is unlikely to be made merely \u2018for the sake of system,\u2019 but rather\nto defend oneself against complexities and uncertainties that one\u2019s situation has rendered acute or even\noverwhelming.\n28 Cf.

Rose, Powers of Freedom: Reframing Political Thought (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999),\np. 51.\n31 We can see this power as the dark side of the three tasks I have emphasised: (i) The agreement in practical\nmoralities might be coerced or involve corrupt moralities, and most likely both. (ii) The allocation of\nresponsibilities might be systematically muddled or obscured; members might be thoroughly disempowered,\ntheir ability to fulfil their responsibilities systematically undermined. (iii) It might happen that practical\npluralism is either eliminated, when one institution becomes hegemonic, or rendered unbearable, as when\ninstitutions demand activities that systematically contradict the values involved in other spheres of life.\n32 A.
