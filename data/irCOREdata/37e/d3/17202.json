Yet the existing \nliterature has not done a good job of evaluating the substantive importance of migrants in \nexplaining large disparities in levels of bilateral voice traffic observed between different \ncountries. Nor has it gone very far in examining how the influence of migrant stocks on \ninternational calling is moderated (i.e. amplified or attenuated) by domestic and relational \nfactors. Our contribution in the present article addresses these gaps in the literature. For a \nsample which includes a far larger number of countries than previous studies, we show that, \ntogether with shorter-term visitors, bilateral migrant stocks emerge as the relational variable \nwith one of the substantively largest influences over cross-national patterns of telephone \ncalls. We also find that the effect of bilateral migrant stocks on inter-country telephone traffic \nis greater where the country pairs are richer and more spatially distant from one another. \n2 \n Introduction \n \nRecent work has ascribed a major role for telecommunications in the lives of cross-border \nmigrants (Esman 2009; Horst 2006; Ros 2010). Amongst others, remote communications are \nsaid to be important in allowing family and friends to remain in contact; in forging, sustaining \nand re-imagining migrants\u2019 identity; and providing valuable information that forms the basis \nof subsequent migrations. Indeed, it has been suggested that migrants have been a major \ndriving force in the dramatic growth of international telephony over recent decades, \naccounting for large rises in telephone calls between countries with strong \nimmigrant\/emigrant connections (Vertovec 2004). \n The purpose of this article is two-fold. First, it seeks to subject claims about the \ncentrality of migrants in accounting for large disparities in bilateral telephone traffic to \nrigorous empirical scrutiny, and evaluate migrants\u2019 substantive importance vis-\u00e0-vis other \nrelational forms of transnational connectivity. Second, it aims to provide new insights into \nhow geographic attributes \u201cmoderate\u201d the degree to which migrant connections between \nhome and destination countries give rise to international telephone traffic. \n These issues are of both scholarly and applied interest. The importance of migrants in \nshaping patterns of international telephony, for example, is revealing in relation to academic \ndebates about the role of migrants in contemporary transnationalism. Specifically, they \nindicate how longer-term corporeal mobilities underpin subsequent forms of boundary-\nspanning connectivity, and the relative importance of homelands as a site of ongoing social \nrelations. Understanding the factors which mediate the degree to which migrant stocks give \nrise to calls between home and host countries is also of practical significance. Amongst \nothers, this is because boundary-spanning communications between migrants and their \n3 \nhomeland communities may be important in supporting economic development, transnational \nforms of political mobilization and the reproduction of diaspora identities (Esman 2009; Ros \n2010). As an example, telephone calls are known to play a role in arranging remittances \n(Collins 2009; Horst 2006), such that factors which constrain international telephony may \nhave far-reaching implications for family members remaining in the homeland. \nUnfortunately, the literature has not done a good job of evaluating the substantive \nimportance of migrants in international telephony, or investigating the factors which \ninfluence the amount of calling between migrants and their homeland communities. Very few \nmultivariate studies \u2013 which are best-suited to examining the systematic influence of different \nrelational attributes on patterns of bilateral telephone traffic \u2013 have included migrants as an \nexplanatory variable. Those which have done so have typically used comparatively small \nsamples, or crude measures\/proxies which fail to identify migrants\u2019 countries of origin (Cui \n2005; Lago 1970; Rietveld and Janssen 1990; Mu\u0148oz and Amaral 1996; Kellerman 1990; \nSandbach 1996). Importantly, few of these past studies have compared the influence of \nmigrants with other relational attributes, such as trade or investment ties. Regarding the \nmoderating influence of geographic attributes, much of the literature has relied on anecdotes \nand descriptive statistics, for example invoking a role for income or tele-density based on \nsingle country case-studies (Alonso & Oiarzabal 2010). Missing from previous work have \nbeen efforts to systematically analyse how geographic factors impact call volumes between \nmigrants and their homelands using a large sample, multivariate research design.  \nThe present article addresses these gaps. To do so, it makes use of a recent database of \nbilateral migrant stocks (Parsons et al. 2007), which allow us to carry out a more globally \nrepresentative and geographically refined analysis of the relative role of migrants as a source \nof border-spanning connectivity. Additionally, advancing on previous work, we use an \ninteractive model specification to explore how geographic attributes moderate (i.e. amplify or \n4 \nattenuate) the marginal impact of migrant stocks. The results of our large-sample multivariate \nstudy show that, together with shorter-term visitors, migrants emerge as the relational \nvariable with one of the substantively largest influences on cross-national patterns of \ntelephony. However, we find that the actual amount of telephone calling between migrants \nand their homeland communities is increased by two factors, namely, higher aggregate \ncountry pair income and greater distance between the origin and destination countries. The \narticle concludes by discussing the wider academic and applied implications of these results.  \n \nInternational telephone calls \n \nAlthough commercial telephone services date back to the 1870s, it was not until the 1960s \nthat international telephony began to take-off (Fischer 1992). Aided by a series of \ntechnological and organisational innovations, which led to falling costs and improved service \nquality, the volume of international telephone calls increased dramatically from the 1970s \nonwards (Cracknall 1999, TeleGeography 2006). The growing popularity of cellular \ntelephones over the past decade has further fuelled international voice traffic (Comer and \nWikle 2008).  \n  Yet, as with other forms of transnational connectivity and mobility, international \ntelephony is spatially uneven (Perkins and Neumayer 2011). Data on international voice \ntraffic not only reveal that certain countries have higher overall levels of telephone traffic, but \nalso that domestic actors in particular countries tend to communicate more with actors in \ncertain specific foreign countries than others, indicative of a spatiality of transnationalism \n(TeleGeography 2006). Table 1 highlights some of these spatial variations, showing the top \nten inward\/outward calling partners for a small sample of focal countries.  \n \n5 \n<<INSERT TABLE 1 HERE>> \n \nThe table reveals the leading position of the United States (US) as a source\/recipient \nof international telephone calls. The United Kingdom (UK) also emerges as a key calling \npartner amongst the sample of countries. One factor likely contributing to the importance of \nthese countries is that they are host to large numbers of migrants (34.3 and 4.8 million, \nrespectively) who might plausibly give rise to significant volumes of telephone traffic \n(Parsons et al. 2007). The spatial distribution of migrants could well account for other \nbilateral relationships shown in table 1. All of the top ten calling partners with India, for \nexample, are countries which are known to host significant numbers of Indian immigrants. \nLikewise, Germany\u2019s large Turkish migrant community may go some way in explaining why \nTurkey appears amongst the country\u2019s major calling partners.  \nYet, while few would deny a significant role for migrants, they are likely to be one \namongst many factors shaping global patterns of telephony. Thus, another plausible reason as \nto why the US and UK are leading calling partners for the countries featured in the table is \nthat they are major economies, both in gross and per capita terms. Indeed, members of the so-\ncalled G7 \u2013 a grouping comprising the world\u2019s major industrialised economies \u2013 recurrently \nappear as major calling partners in the list. Table 1 also strongly hints at a regional dimension \nto international telephony. Hence, most of Germany\u2019s most important calling partners are \nlocated in the European macro-region, Canada and Mexico are the leading calling partners of \nthe US, while Argentina and Chile appear in Brazil\u2019s list of major calling partners. As \nexplained below, these distance-related dynamics may arise because it is cheaper to call \ncountries in the same macro-region, individuals are more likely to holiday in the near abroad, \ncountries in the same region trade and invest more with each other, or even regional \nneighbours are more likely to speak a common language.  \n6 \nFrom this brief snap-shot of calling partners, it is apparent that a number of \ngeographic factors possibly contribute to shaping uneven patterns of bilateral telephony \nacross the globe, and migrants are only one of these. Unfortunately, in the absence of a \nmultivariate research design with controls, identifying the influence of individual \ndeterminants remains problematic.  \n \nMigrants in international telephony \n \nThere are a number of reasons why migrants might be expected to have been a significant \nfactor underpinning the (uneven) growth of international telephone traffic. The first is the \nhigh number of migrants, with one recent estimate suggesting that there are currently 200 \nmillion people living outside their country of origin, equivalent to 3 percent of the world\u2019s \npopulation (Ratha and Xu 2008). Another is that falling costs and innovations such as pre-\npaid telephone cards have made it possible for migrants and communities in their homeland \nto call one another more regularly and for longer (Karikari and Gyimah-Brempong 1999; \nVertovec 2004). The third is that the corporeal movement of migrants can be seen as creating \nrelational ties between homelands and new host countries, giving rise to telephone calls, as \nmigrants seek to remain in voice contact with communities in their homeland (and vice \nversa).  \nOne reason for calling is psychological (Alonso and Oiarzabal 2010; Kellerman \n2006). Migrants\u2019 country of birth is likely to hold particular salience to the extent that it \n\u2018generates strong emotional ties and can continue to serve as a significant community of \nreference\u2019 (Hiller and Franz 2004: 733). Maintaining on-going contact with the homeland \nmay help migrants to retain a sense of collective identity, belonging and ethnic solidarity. \nWithin recent work, it is also said to play a role in reinvigorating existing or forging new \n7 \nbonds amongst diasporic communities with a real or imagined homeland (Collins 2009; \nGhorashi and Boersma 2009; Smith and White 2004; Wong and Salaff 1998).  \nAt a personal level, calling is likely to be closely associated with boundary-spanning \n\u2018interpersonal ties\u2019 (Poros 2001), with migrants using telephones to talk with their families, \npartners and friends (Harvey 2009; Levitt and Jaworsky 2007). Indeed, anecdotal evidence \nindicates that migrants frequently make telephone calls to their relatives abroad, and regularly \nreceive calls from family and partners located in their country of origin (Beaverstock 2005; \nHorst 2006; Thompson 2009). Amongst others, telephone calls provide a means for re-\nestablishing links with family and friends, and for children to bond with their grandparents. \nImportantly, international telecommunications between kin are also known to play a role in \nthe provision of remittances, with financial transfers potentially enabling families \u201cback \nhome\u201d to afford the costs of telephony (Collins 2009). \nAt a wider level, international call demand might arise as migrants or actors in their \ncountry of origin strategically exploit \u2018network capital\u2019, that is, the resources available from \nan extended network of contacts (Wong and Salaff 1998). Hence domestic actors may draw \nupon foreign diaspora to advance economic and social development (Margheritis 2007; \nMercer et al. 2009). As a form of state-led transnationalism (Elrick and Ciobanu 2009), \ngovernments have also been known to proactively make use of \u2018ethnic\u2019 networks in foreign \ncountries, e.g. by recruiting prominent diaspora members to make business introductions \n(Datta 2009; Esman 2009; Harvey 2009). Additionally, diaspora ties may provide the \nfoundation for transnational business relationships, with managers, entrepreneurs, etc., \npreferentially dealing with companies managed by individuals from a similar self-identified \nethnic group (Peng 2000). The important point is that these transnational networks between \nmigrants and actors in the home territory are likely to be the source of bilateral telephone \ncalls. \n8 \n Previous work and its shortcomings  \n \nTwo types of empirical study have identified a role for migrants. The first draws the inference \nthat migrants have been a major driving force in the growth of international telephony based \non the observation that a large share of particular countries\u2019 telephone traffic is with other \ncountries which are the source\/destination of migrants. A prominent example is Vertovec \n(2004) who provides descriptive data showing that minutes of voice traffic between particular \ncountries with strong immigrant connections have risen significantly over the period 1995-\n2001 (see also Collins (2009) and Kellerman (1990)). A second type of research uses \nmultivariate research designs with controls. These studies generally support the idea that \nbilateral migrants and telephone traffic are positively correlated (Cui 2005; Mu\u0148oz and \nAmaral 1996; Rietveld and Janssen 1990; Sandbach 1996).3  \nYet, although confirming what one might expect, both sets of studies suffer from a \nnumber of shortcomings. First, they fail to tell us how substantively important migrants are as \na source of boundary-spanning connectivity, especially vis-\u00e0-vis other possible determinants \nof international telephony. This shortcoming is especially acute in the case of Vertovec\u2019s \n(2004) oft-cited work. By focusing solely on migrants, and failing to take account of other \nfactors which might additionally drive international telephony, his assertions based on simple \nbivariate associations between migrant numbers and bilateral calling volumes are potentially \nmisleading. Indeed, because several of these \u201cother\u201d variables are likely to be correlated with \nmigrant stocks, it is highly questionable as to whether inferences can be made about the \noverall influence of migrants on bilateral calling. Additionally, based on observations from a \ncomparatively small sample of non-randomly selected countries which have experienced \nlarge growth in bilateral call volumes, it remains unclear as to whether the influence of \n9 \nmigrants on telephone calls identified in Vertovec\u2019s (2004) work holds more generally across \na larger sample of developed and developing countries. \nExisting multivariate studies are superior in many of these respects, but also suffer \nfrom a number of weaknesses which limit their usefulness in evaluating claims about the \nsubstantive importance of migrants.  Several of them use crude, geographically aggregated \nmeasures. Thus, Sandbach\u2019s (1996) finding that migrants have a positive influence on cross-\nborder telephone traffic is based on a simple dummy variable, which attempts to capture the \npresence of large numbers of Turkish guest workers in Germany. Other studies have used \nmeasures which fail to distinguish between migrants\u2019 country of origin (Mu\u0148oz and Amaral \n1996). \nAnother important weakness of existing multivariate studies is that they are based on \ncomparatively small country samples. Most focus on incoming\/outgoing telephone calls \nto\/from a single focal country e.g. Spain or the US (Cui 2005; Lago 1970; Mu\u0148oz and Amaral \n1996). Needless to say, such a narrow geographic focus restricts the generalizability of these \nstudies\u2019 findings, and prompts questions as to whether similar patterns hold for larger country \nsamples. Where specified, samples of the telecommunications partner countries are larger, \ne.g. 23 countries for Lago (1970), 27 countries for Rietveld and Janssen (1990) and 57 \ncountry routes for Cui (2005), but these still represent a small proportion of the world\u2019s \nstates.  \nA further factor which limits the usefulness of past multivariate studies is that the only \ntwo studies which have gone on to investigate the relative importance of migrants have \nproduced contradictory results. For outward international calling traffic from the Netherlands, \nRietveld and Janssen (1990) find that trade explained the vast majority of variations, while \nmigration only had a minor influence. Conversely, Cui (2005) finds that tourism and foreign \nborn population are more influential determinants of calling between the US and major \n10 \nforeign communication routes than trade. It is worth noting that both of these studies focus on \na single developed focal country.  \nA second important generic shortcoming of previous work is that it has paid very little \nattention to the factors which moderate the influence of migrant stocks on bilateral calling. \nThe existing literature has generally assumed that there exists a straightforward relationship \nbetween migrants and the volume of bilateral telephone traffic. Yet, from a conceptual \nperspective, the degree to which higher migrant stocks give rise to increased voice traffic \nmight well depend on other geographic attributes influencing the effective demand for \ntelephony amongst migrants and actors in their homeland.  \nTo be fair, a number of authors have acknowledged that migrant-related telephony is \nlikely to depend on characteristics of the host country, as well as migrant communities \nthemselves. Relevant factors mentioned in this respect include income and existing tele-\ndensity (Collins 2009; Horst 2006; Alonso and Oiarzabal 2010). However, beyond the use of \nanecdotes and descriptive statistics, very little empirical work has been undertaken into the \ndomestic and relational attributes influencing the amount of calling between migrants and \nhomeland communities. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, previous multivariate studies \nhave ignored this issue outright.  \n \nRe-examining migrant-related telephony \n \nOur study seeks to address these weaknesses and gaps in the existing literature. We answer \ntwo questions: (1) how substantively important are migrants in shaping patterns of  bilateral \ntelephony vis-\u00e0-vis other relational attributes; and (2) what factors moderate the impact of \nmigrant stocks on levels of bilateral telephony? \n11 \nAdvancing on previous bivariate work, we use multivariate, quantitative techniques \nwhich allow us to control for other variables which might influence patterns of bilateral \ntelephony, including those which are correlated with migrant stocks.  Two datasets are used \nin the study, namely: one which records the cumulative number of migrants from country i \nresiding in country j (Parsons et al. 2007); and one which measures the annual number of \ntelephone call minutes between country i and country j (TeleGeography 2006). An important \nadvantage of these data is that they allow us to use a dyadic research design, wherein we \nexamine (the sum of incoming and outgoing) telephone traffic between country pairs for a far \ngreater number of states than previous research, including many developing ones. The \ninclusion of the latter is significant because a large number of international migrants originate \nand reside in developing countries (Levitt and Jaworsky 2007; Ratha and Xu 2008). Further, \ninternational telephone calls not only occur between pairs of developed economies, or \ndeveloped and developing countries, but between developing-country pairs (TeleGeography \n2006). \nWe also advance on previous work by using an interactive model specification which \nenables us to analyse how the impact of migrant stocks on international telephone calls is \namplified or retarded by various geographic factors. More specifically, we model the \ninfluence of bilateral migrant stocks as conditional on two key variables, namely: (a) the sum \nof country pair per capita incomes and (b) distance between country pairs. We include these \ntwo variables because, as explained below, they might be expected to play an especially \ninfluential role in shaping the propensity of migrants and individuals in their homeland to call \none another. There are, of course, other attributes which could plausibly have a conditioning \ninfluence. Yet these are either closely related to the above (e.g. tele-density) or the conceptual \narguments regarding their influence are less compelling than income or physical distance. \n \n12 \nResearch design \n \nWe use econometric estimation techniques to address our research questions. Before detailing \nour sample and estimator, we describe the dependent, main explanatory and control variables \nused in the study.    \n \nDependent variable  \n \nThe dependent variable is the annual sum of minutes of bilateral voice traffic between \ncountry pairs (i.e. dyads) using data from TeleGeography (2006). These data cover traffic \nfrom both landlines and cellular phones routed through conventional international Time \nDivision Multiplexed networks. One possible objection to the use of Telegeogaphy\u2019s \ntelephone voice data is that they do not include Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) traffic. \nHowever, non-dyadic data from Telegeogaphy (2006) show that these flows accounted for a \nsmall share of overall international voice traffic volumes during the period of our study. \nWe focus on the sum of traffic between country pairs, rather than on the traffic \nbalance between two countries of a country pair, which are often highly uneven. Formally, \nthis makes our dependent variable an undirected dyadic variable (Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper \n2010). As is documented in the literature, the existence of reverse calling, differential \nsettlement rates and call externalities mean that actors from one country may make many \nmore outward calls to a specific country than they receive (e.g. Acton and Vogelsang 1992; \nKarikari and Gyimah-Brempong 1999). Because our central concern is with the role of \nmigrants and other relational attributes, rather than the economics of inward and outward \ncalling balances, a focus on the sum total of bilateral calls makes sense as it allows us to \nconcentrate on key variables of interest. Controlling for uneven traffic balances would require \n13 \nan estimation model with variables explaining differences in incoming\/outgoing calls \nbetween countries and the limited availability of data for such variables would severely \nconstrain the sample size. \n \nMain explanatory variable \n \nWe obtain data on bilateral migrant stocks from Parsons et al. (2007) which is the most \ngeographically extensive source currently available and which has previously been used in a \nnumber of recently published studies (e.g. Kapur and McHale 2009; Perkins and Neumayer \n2008). Constructed mainly from national censuses, the dataset records the stock of migrants \nin a particular destination country j from a particular territory of origin i, for a total of 226 \nstates. Migrants are taken by the authors as individuals born outside their current country of \nresidence.4 Consistent with analyzing the sum total of bilateral telephone calls, our migrant \nstock variable measures the sum total of bilateral resident migrants, i.e. the sum of migrants \nfrom country i in country j and migrants from country j in country i. \n It is widely acknowledged that measuring migrant numbers is problematic (Williams \nand Hall 2000; Margheritis 2007). Parsons et al.\u2019s data are not entirely immune from these \naccounting problems, e.g. they do not record irregular immigrants, and the quality of data is \ngenerally better for developed than developing countries. It is also worth noting that the data \nonly record aggregate migrant stocks around the time of the 2000 national censuses. This \nmeans that our explanatory variable for migrants only offers a snapshot of migrant numbers \nat a single point in time. Still, even though migrant stocks will have continued to change over \nthe course of the following years of the sample period, they are unlikely to have done so \nmuch as to invalidate our findings.  \n \n14 \nOther explanatory variables  \n \nWe also include a number of variables which are designed to capture relational attributes \npreviously identified in the literature as (possible) correlates of bilateral telephony. We do so \nbecause omitting important predictors of voice traffic may, as a result of omitted variable \nbias, lead to wrong inferences regarding the influence of migrant stocks. What is more, we \nare especially interested in the relative importance of migrant stocks vis-\u00e0-vis other relative \nattributes associated with particular mobilities. \n Our first relational variable captures the shorter-term movement of people across \nborders. Like longer-term migrants, tourists give rise to bilateral telephone traffic, as they \nmake calls to\/receive calls from family and friends in their home country (Palm 2002). \nSimilarly, business travellers are known to make\/receive calls to\/from their home country \nwhilst on their trips abroad (Millar and Salt 2008). This is confirmed by a number of \nquantitative studies which show that various measures of visitor flows (total inward\/outward \nflows of tourists, foreign travel expenditure, etc.) have a positive impact on international \ntelephone traffic (Cui 2005; Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oza and P\u00e9rez-Amaral 1998; Kellerman 1990; Lago \n1970; Palm 2002). We use a flow measure of foreign visitors between country pairs ij using \ndata from UNWTO (2007).  \nA second set of relational variables seek to capture \u2018derived demand\u2019 created by \nvarious forms of cross-border economic dependence and, specifically, trade and FDI (Lee et \nal. 2007; Palm 2002; Rietveld and Janssen 1990). International business activity is likely to \ngenerate telephone calls as, for example, buyers and sellers in different countries negotiate \nprices, subsidiaries co-ordinate with foreign parents, and so on (Cracknall 1999; Millar and \nSalt 2008; Warf 2008). The idea that trade (imports or imports and exports) between \ncountries is positively correlated with international telephone traffic is supported by \n15 \nnumerous studies (Cui 2005; Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oza and P\u00e9rez-Amaral 1998; Hackl and Westlund \n1995; Karikari and Gyimah-Brempong 1999; Kellerman 1990; Lago 1970; Rea and Lage \n1978; Rietveld and Janssen 1990; Palm 2002). To the best of our knowledge, evidence that \ndirect investment raises international calling is restricted to a single study1 (Lago 1970), \nalthough we include a FDI measure in our model because it seems entirely plausible that it \nshould be a significant determinant of bilateral call volumes. Our trade variable is a measure \nof bilateral trade volumes (for all goods and services) between country pairs ij while our \ndirect investment variable comprises a measure of bilateral FDI stocks between country pairs \nij. Trade and investment data were obtained from World Bank (2009) and UNCTAD (2009) \nrespectively.  \nA third set of variables attempt to capture spatial proximity. Previous work has found \nthat international calling falls as the distance between the countries of the caller\/recipient \ngrows (Choi 2004; Rietveld and Janssen 1990; Sandbach 2006). Most likely, this is explained \nby the fact that (a) long-distance calling may be more expensive and (b) individuals living \nfurther away are less likely to share associative ties with one another and form part of a \n\u2018community of interest\u2019 (Ouwersloot and Rietveld 2001).2 In the present study, we use two \nmeasures of spatial proximity: (a) physical distance in miles between the country pair\u2019s \ncapital cities and (b) contiguity, measured using a dummy variable for dyads sharing a land \nborder or being separated by less than 150 miles of sea. Distance and contiguity data are \nobtained from Bennett and Stam (2005).  \nA fourth relational attribute does not directly capture ties created by cross-border \nmobilities, i.e. the movement of goods, services, capital, people, but rather common \nlanguage. To the extent that telephone calls require individuals to be able to communicate \nwith one another, traffic should logically be greater between countries where a higher \nproportion of their respective populations share a similar language (Palm 2002), a thesis \n16 \nsupported by the empirical literature (Choi 1994; Sandbach 1996; Yatrakis 1972). In the \npresent article, we use a dummy variable set to one if one of the main languages spoken in \nboth countries is the same. As a final relational attribute, we use a dummy variable set to one \nif the two countries were previously linked in a colonial relationship. We include Russia in \nthis definition since its imposition of political and military control over ex-Soviet territories \nhas been analogous to that exercised by the classic Western and Japanese colonizers. The \nunderlying logic is that actors from ex-colonies are likely to communicate more frequently \nwith individuals in their former colonial masters, and vice versa. Previous research largely \nendorses these claims, although mostly on the basis of findings derived from fairly \nrudimentary research designs (Kellerman 1990; Palm 2002; Rietveld and Janssen 1990). Data \nfor these fourth and fifth relational variables are from CIA (2009).   \nWe also control for a number of non-relational factors which should influence levels \nof telephone traffic. One is per capita income which is anticipated to have a positive impact \non international calling. Individuals in richer countries should be better-able to afford the \ncosts of making, receiving or returning international calls. Residents might find it easier to \nmake calls because they have greater personal access to fixed telephone lines in their homes \nor can afford their own cellular handset. Directly, the quality of telephone infrastructure \nshould be superior in richer countries, both in terms of its coverage and capacity. Lending \nweight to these arguments, Karikari and Gyimah-Brempong (1999) provide evidence that \ncapacity constraints have reduced outgoing calls (and, to a lesser extent, incoming ones) \nbetween various African countries and the US. Directly, a number of studies have found that \nGDP p.c. (per capita) is a statistically significant predictor of outward calling volumes (e.g. \nRea and Lage 1978; Sandbach 1996). We take the sum of GDP p.c. of the two countries as \nthe relevant variable, rather than the product, because we find it plausible that a high GDP \n17 \np.c. in one country can substitute for a low GDP p.c. in the other country since for bilateral \ntelephony it is sufficient if one party can afford long-distance international calls. \nFinally, we also include the sum of population sizes of the two countries to control for \nthe fact that more populous countries should have more bilateral telephone traffic. We also \ninclude the squared term of this variable. Pre-tests showed that, entered without its squared \nterm, a higher combined population size increases bilateral telephone traffic if no year-\nspecific country fixed effects are included (on these, see the discussion further below). Yet, if \nthese fixed effects are included, population size is associated with decreased bilateral \ntelephone traffic. Because this is counter-intuitive, we include the squared population term to \nallow for a non-monotonous effect of population size on telephone traffic, which is in fact \nwhat we find. Data for GDP p.c. and population were obtained from World Bank (2009).  \n \nInteraction effects \n \nWe explore how the influence of bilateral migrant stocks on inter-country voice calling traffic \nis conditioned by two attributes. The first attribute, sum of country pair income, is \nhypothesized to amplify the marginal impact of migrants. As described above, residents in \npoorer countries are less likely to call abroad, both for demand and supply-side reasons. \nMigrants and their families, partners and friends in the home country may still wish to call \neach other. Yet they may be constrained in doing so by limited purchasing power, access to \nlandlines\/cellular phones, or inadequate transmission capacity (Panagakos and Horst 2006). \nThe result: larger stocks of bilateral migrants will give rise to more voice traffic in country \npairs where the sum of GDP p.c. is greater.  \nAlthough no previous studies have explicitly investigated the links between country \nincome and international calling associated with migrants, empirical research nevertheless \n18 \nsupports our underlying line of argument. Within this context, case-study evidence \ndocuments how a combination of ability to pay and calling capacity constraints have \nhistorically limited telephone usage by migrants or their geographically remote family, \npartners and friends in lower-income home countries (Collins 2009; Horst 2006). As detailed \nabove, quantitative studies show that GDP p.c. is positively correlated with international \ncalling, with telephone call demand found to be more price inelastic in richer countries (Cui \n2005; Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oza and P\u00e9rez-Amaral 1998). To the extent that migrants and associated \nhomeland actors may account for a significant share of this traffic, their influence on calling \nminutes might plausibly be sensitive to country income.  \n A second conditioning variable introduced in the present study is physical proximity \nin terms of distance between the country pairs. The influence of proximity on the marginal \nimpact of migrant stocks is theoretically ambiguous. Physical proximity could increase \ninternational calling if the higher costs of longer-distance calling deters remote telephony, or \nif the strength of ties between migrants and homeland communities are stronger because \ntravel and telephony are complements, and distance reduces the amount of physical travel \n(Larsen et al. 2006; Kellerman 2006; Ouwersloot and Rietveld 2001). On the other hand, it \ncould be that telephone traffic increases with growing distance between the source and \ndestination countries of international migrants. One possibility is that telephone calls are a \nsubstitute to more costly physical travel, such that migrants and homeland actors in spatially \nremote country pairs call each other more, but travel less (Salomon 1985). Another \npossibility is that migrants residing in more spatially distant countries, which might be \nexpected to share less in common with their homeland, call more because they have a greater \npsychological need to re-connect with their territorial birthplace as a means to reaffirm or \nconstruct their in-group identity. Indeed, consistent with these interpretations, interviews with \n19 \nmigrants suggest that communication technologies can help to foster a sense of \u2018closeness\u2019 \nand \u2018belonging\u2019 with distant communities (Ros 2010: 57).  \n Again, existing multivariate work fails to provide a direct answer to the question of \nwhether distance increases or decreases the marginal influence of bilateral migrant stocks. \nThe empirical literature suggests that, for traffic from all groups, distance has a negative \ninfluence on inter-country calling (e.g. Sandbach 1996). Yet this does not necessarily mean \nthat distance has the same conditioning influence on the propensity of migrants or their \nfamily, partners and friends to call one another.  \n \nEstimation technique and sample \n \nIn line with standard gravity-type models, we employ a logarithmic estimation model in \nwhich all variables (except dummies) are in natural logs. The advantage of this model is that \nit allows for an easy interpretation of the estimated coefficients as elasticities. To account for \nfundamental differences across countries which could be correlated with our explanatory \nvariables, the omission of which would cause omitted variable bias, we include year-specific \nfixed effects for both of the countries in a dyad. In other words, each country of a country \npair has its own intercept, which varies from year-to-year. Standard errors are adjusted for the \nclustering of observations on country dyads. This stringent and conservative estimation \nstrategy reduces the possibility of spurious findings. In sum, we estimate the following base \nmodel: \n \nln ln ln ln lnijt ij ijt ijt ijttelephony migrantstock visitors trade FDIstock= + + +  \n2ln( ) ln( ) ln( ) ln ijit jt it jt it jtGDPpc GDPpc pop pop pop pop dist+ + + + + + +  \nij i t j t ijtij ij u vcontiguity samelanguage coloniallink \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b5+ + + + \u22c5 + \u22c5 +  \n20 \n The variables are defined as described above, i tu \u03b3\u22c5  and j tv \u03b3\u22c5  are the year-specific effects \nfor each country of a dyad and ijt\u03b5  is the idiosyncratic error term. To this, we add two \ninteraction effects in a separate estimation: one of the migrant stock with GDP p.c. and the \nother of the migrant stock with distance. \n Our data cover 160 countries over the years 2001-2006. For these 160 countries, \nTeleGeography does not report positive telephone traffic with all potential partner countries, \nsuch that we have telephony data for a subset of potential country dyads. In addition, data for \nthe explanatory variables are not available for all dyads for which voice traffic data exist, \nleaving us with a final sample of 2041 country dyads. \n \n<<INSERT TABLE 2 HERE>> \n \n \nResults \n \nTable 2 shows our estimation results. We begin with the model where our migrant stock \nvariable enters in its non-interacted form (column 1). We estimate a positive and statistically \nsignificant relationship between measures of bilateral telephone voice traffic minutes and \nbilateral migrant stocks. Turning to other variables, our estimated coefficient of visitor flows \nis significantly positive, suggesting that cross-border travelers between country pairs give rise \nto increased bilateral telephone traffic. This is hardly surprising given our result for migrant \nstocks.  Migrants and visitors are related in a number of ways and the reasons as to why their \ncross-border movements should give rise to higher telephone traffic are likely to overlap \n(Williams and Hall 2000). \n21 \n We also find evidence that economic dependencies increase bilateral telephone traffic. \nThe estimated coefficient of our measure of bilateral trade is statistically significant with the \nanticipated positive sign. Likewise, we show that levels of bilateral FDI stocks are also a \nstatistically significant predictor of telephone calling minutes between country pairs. \n  How substantively important are these relational attributes? Migrant stock is the \nvariable with the highest estimated elasticity. We find that a ten percent increase in the size of \nbilateral migrant stocks is associated with a 3 percent increase in bilateral telephone traffic. \nThe estimated increase in telephony is 2.8 percent, 2.4 percent and 0.7 percent for a ten \npercent increase in the bilateral flow of short-term visitors, bilateral trade and bilateral FDI \nstocks, respectively. Thus, migrant stocks not only have a substantively important effect on \nbilateral telephone traffic, but also the strongest one of the four relational mobilities.5  \n As expected, we find that higher aggregate GDP p.c. in the partner countries leads to \nmore bilateral telephone traffic, indicating that demand for international telephone calls is \nwhat economists call a normal good. A higher combined sum of population size is associated \nwith lower bilateral telephone traffic \u2013 albeit at a decreasing rate. The negative effect of \npopulation size converges to zero at a combined population size of c.100 million, eventually \nbecoming positive, but only at very high levels. As mentioned in the research design section, \nthe (partially) negative effect of population size disappears if the model is estimated without \nyear-specific country fixed effects. \nTurning to our measures of spatial proximity, we find that physical distance between \nthe country pairs has a statistically significantly negative effect on bilateral telephony. That \nis, actors in countries further away from one another call each other less. The fact that we \naccount for other well-known distance-dependent variables in our research design, i.e. trade, \ninvestment, migration and tourist flows (e.g. see Parsons et al. 2007; Portes et al. 2001), \nsuggests that the influence of distance is not mainly operating through mechanisms associated \n22 \nwith these relational attributes. It could be that higher calling costs deter longer-distance \ntelephony, or that distance captures the general tendency of individuals to be less personally \nor professionally acquainted with people living in countries further away (Ouwersloot and \nRietveld 2001). The coefficient for a further measure of spatial proximity, contiguity, fails to \nachieve statistical significance at conventional levels. This could be because, once we take \naccount of other relational attributes which might be correlated with contiguity, actors in \nneighboring countries do not call each other more than actors in non-contiguous countries. \n Finally, we find that country pairs where one of their main languages is shared call \neach other more. This result is interesting, particularly given our specification of other \nexplanatory variables, indicating that language does not matter simply because of the co-\npresence of first-generation migrants or travelers. In fact, the presence of a common language \nhas a substantively very strong effect, raising bilateral telephony by approximately 44 per \ncent.6 However, we find no evidence that a former colonial relationship leads to increased \nbilateral calling, which could be because we take account of other attributes which are \ncorrelated with colonial ties such as trade and migration.  \n Columns 2 and 3 show our estimation results with the interaction effects included. All \nof the other main explanatory\/control variables remain statistically significant with the same \nsigns as in the non-interacted model. We find that the coefficient of migrant stocks \nconditioned on the sum of country pair GDP is positive and statistically significant. That is, \nthe influence of migrant stocks on bilateral telephony is greater for richer country pairs, \npossibly because telephone infrastructure is better-developed and migrants (together with \ntheir associates in the home country) are better-able to afford the costs of international \ntelephony. The estimated coefficient of the variable which interacts migrant stocks with \nphysical distance is also positive and statistically significant. What this suggests is that the \nmarginal influence of migrant stocks on bilateral telephony is higher where migrants are \n23 \nfurther away from their country of origin. In other words, while distance generally impedes \ninternational telephony, it would appear to amplify voice traffic associated with migrant \nstocks. \nNote, with interacted variables, the coefficient of any constituent variable on its own \nno longer has the same meaning as in non-interacted models. The insignificant coefficient of \nthe migrant stock variable does not imply that foreign born residents no longer have an \ninfluence over international calling. All that counts are the coefficients of the interaction \neffect variables which, in our estimations, suggest that the effect of migrant stocks on \nbilateral telephony volumes increase as country pair income and distance grows. This is \nconfirmed by figures 1 and 2, which plot the effect of migrant stocks as a function of the \nvalues of the two conditioning variables. They show that the estimated effect of the migrant \nstock variable is positive even at low levels of the pair sum of GDP p.c. and distance. Yet the \neffect increases as distance between the country pair grows and rises, even more strongly, \nwith higher aggregate sum of both countries\u2019 GDP p.c. Thus, where country pairs are close, a \nten percent increase in the stock of migrants raises bilateral telephony by just above two \npercent, but by almost 3.5 percent where the two countries are far apart. At very low \ncombined levels of per capita income, a ten percent increase in the stock of migrants only \nraises bilateral telephony by just above one percent, but the same effect is much larger at \nalmost four percent when both countries are rich.  \n \nConclusions and discussion \n \nOne of the most striking indications of the growth of transnationalism has been the dramatic \nexpansion of boundary-spanning communications over recent decades. Evidence suggests \nthat more and more people are remotely communicating with individuals residing in other \n24 \nnational territories, making use of technologies to transcend physical distance, and forging \nnew or sustaining existing relationships (Comer and Wikle 2008; Hiller and Franz 2004; \nWarf 2008). Our contribution in the present article is two-fold: (1) to investigate the relative \nimportance of migrants in generating these boundary-spanning connectivities in the case of \ntelephone traffic; and (2) to investigate how migrants\u2019 influence over bilateral calling is \nshaped by various geographic attributes.  \nFor a sample of 160 developed and developing countries and 2041 country pairs, we \nprovide statistically rigorous evidence that county pairs which are the origin\/destination of a \ngreater number of migrants from one another are likely to have higher levels of inter-country \ntelephone voice traffic. In fact, our results show that migrant stocks are not only a statistically \nsignificant correlate of telephone calling, but also a substantively important one. Together \nwith shorter-term visitors, therefore, longer-term migrants emerge as one of the most \nsubstantively important relational attributes examined in our study. A ten percent increase in \nthe number of either is associated with a 3 or close to three percent increase in bilateral \ntelephone traffic, more than the equivalent figure for bilateral trade (2.4 percent), and \nsubstantially greater than bilateral FDI (less than 1 percent).   \nAnother significant contribution of our article is to show that, although having a large \ninfluence over patterns of inter-country voice traffic, the degree to which stocks generate \nincreased bilateral telephone calls is governed by two factors. First, consistent with the idea \nthat higher income liberates people from place (Hannam et al. 2006), migrant stocks are \nfound to raise bilateral telephony more in county pairs with a higher aggregate sum of per \ncapita incomes. A possible explanation for this finding is that (a) individuals in richer \ncountries have greater access to the means to make telephone calls because of better-\ndeveloped public and private telephone infrastructures and (b) residents of richer countries \n25 \nare more able to afford the costs of making international telephone calls for longer durations \n(Gyimah-Brempong and Karikari 2001).  \nA second factor found to influence the degree to which migrant stocks raise bilateral \ntelephone calling is spatial proximity. Specifically, if migrants are further away from their \ncountry of origin, bilateral call volumes would appear to be relatively higher. This could be \nbecause telephony and physical travel are substitutes, i.e. rather than travelling to meet with \nfamily, partners and friends in person, migrants further away might satisfy their demand for \ncommunication remotely through telephone calls (Falk and Abler 1980; Ouwersloot and \nRietveld 2001). Alternatively, it could be that physical distance increases migrants\u2019 sense of \nisolation and detachment from place, fuelling their desire to connect with people from their \nterritorial homeland via telecommunications (Hiller and Franz 2004: 733).  \nThe above findings have wider implications for debates surrounding global networks, \ntransnationalism and territory. First, they underscore the importance of migrants as a source \nof boundary-spanning connectivity. Our statistical results indicate that the movement of \npeople provides an important morphological foundation for transnational communication \nnetworks and flows (Datta 2008; Harvey 2009). Mobilities of ideas, knowledge and values \nconveyed by voice traffic are mapped on to border crossing mobilities of people, highlighting \nhow global networks are fundamentally rooted in human agency. \nAnother implication that follows from our study, and reinforcing previous case-study \nresearch (Beaverstock 2005; Ghorashi and Boersma 2009; Horst 2006; Smith and White \n2004), is that migrants remain closely-wedded to their territory of origin. That existing stocks \nof migrants have a substantively strong effect on international telephone traffic suggests that \npeoples\u2019 birthplace provides a basis for ongoing transnational ties. The homeland would \nappear to retain an important position in the lives of geographically dispersed migrant \ncommunities, possibly because of the existence of inter-personal ties with family, partners \n26 \nand friends, but also because place and territory provide an anchor for personal identity, in-\ngroup belonging and community (Hiller and Franz 2004; Smith and White 2004; Kellerman \n2006). Thus, despite growing corporeal mobilities, peoples\u2019 affinities continue to be moored \nin particular places.  \n Technological innovations, by making international calling more convenient and less \ncostly, are likely to support a strengthening of these transnational communicative ties. \nRegulatory changes could well have a similar effect. More specifically, reforms which open-\nup telephone markets to new players, increase competition and stimulate new investment can,  \nunder the right circumstances, lower prices and improve service quality (Wallsten 2001; \nEstache et al. 2006). In doing so, they could make long-distance telephony more accessible \nand affordable, allowing migrants and communities in the homeland to communicate more \nfrequently and for longer (c.f. Mu\u0148oz and Amaral 1996; Vertovec 2004). \nInevitably, the way in which people communicate across borders will evolve over \ntime, with short message servicing (SMS), social networking, and emailing becoming more \nimportant (Panagakos and Horst 2006). Moreover, how voice traffic itself is delivered is also \nlikely to change, moving more towards internet-based forms of transmission. Yet it seems \nunlikely that voice traffic itself will diminish in that other forms of communication are just \nas, or indeed more likely, to be complements than substitutes (Andersson et al. 2009).  \n The ability of migrants and their family and friends in the country of origin to \ncommunicate more readily, cheaply, frequently and in more diverse ways is likely to have \nmultiple consequences. These range from the ability of people to sustain friendships with \nindividuals in other countries, self-identified ethnic groups\u2019 propensity to organize \ncollectively, and even corporeal mobilities. For example, heightened communicative ties \ncould further stimulate chain migration, as individuals in the homeland learn more about \nparticular destinations through more regular conversations with prior emigrants. More \n27 \nresearch is needed in this area, however, to explore some of the positive and negative \nconsequences of growing transnational communicative capacities and practices.  \nAs well as regulatory and technological changes, another important factor which is \nlikely to shape the future of migrant-related telephony is border controls. A growing number \nof countries, including those which have historically operated more liberal regimes (e.g. \nCanada and the UK), are imposing heightened restrictions on immigration. By limiting the \nlonger-term movement of people, such controls could well slow the growth of associated \ncross-border telephony, notably between countries exercising controls. On the flip-side, it \ncould be that individuals, finding it more difficult to travel to particular countries, instead \nmake more cross-border calls to their family and friends. \n What potential public policy interventions following from our empirical analysis? \nMost importantly, our article points to the importance of public policy measures to address \nthe affordability of long-distance communications. Contrary to the idea that the falling costs \nof telecommunications mean that affordability is no longer a barrier to long-distance \ntelephony, our results suggest that income continues to act as a constraint. These constraints \nare important in view of the potential significance of tele-connectivity for migrants\u2019 well-\nbeing, arising from a sense of identity, belonging to a wider community and contact with \nfamily and friends. It is also important from a developmental perspective in that \u2013 both for \npeople in home and host states \u2013 long-distance communication may play a role in leveraging \nremittances, transnational network capital and other forms of assistance.  \nThe need for public interventions to increase the affordability of calling is likely to be \nespecially important in lower-income countries. Of course, there is only so much \ngovernments can do to address per capita income, at least in the short-term. Yet efforts to \nreduce the costs of international communications may be facilitated by various regulatory \nreforms which make calling and other forms of communications cheaper. In fact, these \n28 \ninitiatives may take on particular significance for spatially-distant migrants, in that their \ndemand for long-distance communications would appear to be stronger.  \n \n \nEndnotes \n \n \n1 This may in part be due to the relative lack of publicly available data on bilateral FDI \u2013 a shortcoming that we \novercame by acquiring additional data from UNCTAD (2009). \n \n2 Spatial proximity is a potentially ambiguous underlying influence on telephony. It is not entirely clear as to \nwhether physical distance itself deters remote communications, or whether distance is a proxy variable, \ncapturing the effect that distant dyads enjoy less bilateral investment, travel, etc. Indeed, we argue that it only \nmakes sense to include measures of spatial proximity if other theoretically plausible distance-dependent \nrelational ties are included in the multivariate model, as is done in the present study. \n \n3 An exception is Lago (1970) who finds that a higher share of parents who came from a particular country did \nnot increase calling from the US for the period 1962-1964. \n \n4 Note, where data on the foreign born population were unavailable, the creators of the dataset used data on \nforeign nationality to construct their measure of migration stocks. \n \n5 Another way to evaluate the relative importance of each of these four relational variables is by dropping each \none separately from the estimation model to assess the effect on the model fit, taking into account model \ncomplexity, as given by Akaike Informaton Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Doing \nso shows that the largest increase in AIC\/BIC, representing a worse model fit, follows from dropping the \nmigrant stock variable, followed by short-term visitors, trade and FDI. In other words, this analysis of relative \nimportance to the model fit is consistent with our analysis of relative substantive importance in terms of \nestimated elasticities. \n29 \n6 Note, because common language is a dummy variable, its substantive importance can only be assessed in terms \nof the presence versus absence of linguistic ties. It is thus not directly comparable to the substantive importance \nof our four main relational variables.\n30 \nReferences \n \nActon, J. P. & Vogelsang, I.
