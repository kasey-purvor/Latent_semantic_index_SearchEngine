It is concluded that even extremely weak noise is\nsufficient to induce dynamical complexity in an SNA.\nPACS: 05.45.+b, 05.40.+j, 02.50.Ey\nkeywords: strange nonchaotic attractor, noise in nonlinear system, Lyapunov expo-\nnent, dynamical and geometrical complexity.\n1. Introduction\nThe defining property of chaotic motion is conventionally taken to be an exponential\ndivergence of nearby trajectories, i.e. a sensitive dependence on initial conditions [1, 2].\nUsually, it is also characterized by a strange attractor, with a complex fractal structure\nin phase space. Until recently the terms strange attractor and chaotic attractor were\ntaken to be synonymous, although the two notions refer to quite different properties of\nthe attractor: chaotic reflects its dynamical properties, i.e. the presence of exponential\ndivergence of the trajectories, whereas strange implies the complexity of its structure, i.e.\nrelates to geometrical properties.\n1\nPublished in Phys. Lett. A 268, 315-322 (2000).\nIt is now well established that, not only can an attractor can be strange\/chaotic\nand nonstrange\/nonchaotic (i.e. regular), but it can also be strange\/nonchaotic [2, 3] and\nnonstrange\/chaotic [4, 5, 6]. Because of the seeming oddity of the latter two combinations\nof features, these attractors have evoked much interest and attention. Many papers are\ndevoted to the study of the strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA), an object that typically\narises in quasiperiodically driven systems as an intermediate link between regular and\nchaotic attractors [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nAn SNA has a geometrically complex structure (the attractor is not a finite set of\npoints, and it is not piecewise differentiable), but it exhibits no sensitivity to initial\nconditions. SNAs have been studied extensively, both theoretically and experimentally.\nMost papers consider the process by which an SNA can be created from a regular attractor;\nor its disappearance in the transition to a strange chaotic attractor [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,\n15, 16, 17]. It was found that a typical SNA trajectory is characterized by a fluctuation\nof its finite-time Lyapunov exponents between negative and positive values [10, 12] but\nthat, asymptotically as t \u2192 \u221e, the Lyapunov exponent is negative. Lai et al. [13, 14]\ncompared the properties of an SNA with a chaotic attractor, and they showed that the\ndifference relates solely to the sign of the LLE. Shuai and Wong [16] investigated a map\nwith periodically fluctuating finite-time Lyapunov exponents. They described a different\nroute to the creation of an SNA in this map, and discussed the effect of truncation errors\non the dynamics.\nIn all these papers, both experimental and theoretical, it was the sign of the LLE that\nwas used to establish the nonchaotic character of the SNA, and thus to distinguish the\nSNA from a chaotic attractor. At first sight, this is entirely rerasonable because a positive\nLLE implies that an infinitely-small perturbation will grow exponentially, indicating a\nsensitivity to initial conditions leading to unpredictability of the motion, mixing, and\nthus chaos. A negative LLE implies that an infinitely-small perturbation tends to zero\nas t \u2192 \u221e. The LLE is also used to demonstrate the robustness of the SNA to weak\nnoise: it has been shown that weak noise does not change the sign of LLE. However it\nis well known [24] that, for a noisy system, the LLE is not good indicator of complexity\nand predictability of the motion and, in [24] another approach was offered. It examines\nthe predictability (complexity) of the trajectory on a strong nonuniform attractor: if,\n2\nfollowing a period of relaxation, there are time intervals during which nearby trajectories\ndiverge exponentially and can be in any region of the attractor, then such an attractor is\ndescribed as complex, because during such time intervals it is impossible to predict the\ntrajectory\u2019s behavior. Under such conditions, the attractor may have a negative LLE.\nWe will call the attractor complex, if the trajectory behavior is unpredictable in the\nsense described above. To avoid misunderstandings, we emploiy the term chaotic (non-\nchaotic) to imply a positive (negative) LLE. In other words, we will refer to the attractor\nas chaotic (nonchaotic), if the divergence (convergence) of trajectories predominates on\naverage.\nIn this Letter we discuss the effect of noise on an SNA in an underdamped system and\nwe show that even extremely weak noise is sufficient to convert it to complex attractor.\nWe will consider the peculiarities of time evolution from nearby initial conditions in an\nunderdamped system driven by a quasiperiodic signal. As an example, we consider the\nquasiperiodically driven Duffing oscillator:\nx\u00a8+ \u03b1x\u02d9+ \u03b2(x3 \u2212 x) = A(sin\u03c91t+ sin\u03c92t) +\n\u221a\nD\u03be(t). (1)\nHere \u03b1 and \u03b2 govern the dynamics of the system: we choose \u03b1 = 0.632, \u03b2 = 4. The\nquantities A, \u03c91 and \u03c92 are respectively the amplitude and frequencies of the external\ntwo-frequency forcing; \u03be(t) is a Gaussian white noise of intensity D. We examine the\ncase of an irrational ratio between the frequencies: \u03c91 = 2.1235, \u03c92 =\n\u221a\n5. As a control\nparameter we choose the amplitude A of the quasiperiodic forcing.\n2. Dynamics in the absence of noise\nWe first analyze the behavior of the oscillator in the absence of noise. We calculate\nthe LLE over a time 10000 2\u03c0\/\u03c91 by use of a standard algorithm [18]. Fig. 1(a) shows\nthat, with increasing signal amplitude, the LLE also grows and that it changes sign at\nA \u2248 0.7875. Consequently at this moment a chaotic attractor appears. To distinguish the\nSNA from the quasiperiodic attractor it is necessary to use other characteristics [7, 9]: we\nconstruct the stroboscopic section in coordinates (x(tn),\u0398n), where \u0398n = (n\n\u03c92\n\u03c91\n)(mod 1),\ntn = n2\u03c0\/\u03c91; then choose a point on section (x(tn\u2032),\u0398n\u2032), and its nearest calculated\nneighbor in the \u0398 coordinate (x(tn\u2032\u2032),\u0398n\u2032\u2032), such that |\u0398n\u2032 \u2212\u0398n\u2032\u2032 | and |x(tn\u2032)\u2212x(tn\u2032\u2032)| are\nsmall; finally, we monitor the evolution of the distance between the coordinates |x(tn\u2032+m)\u2212\n3\nx(tn\u2032\u2032+m)|, with the distance in the \u0398 direction remaining constant. If the distance between\npoints varies erratically with time and exhibits sharp and short-lived bursts, then it implies\nthe presence of discontinuities on the attractor, thereby indicating its fractal structure\nor strangeness. Based on this method we have found that an SNA arises at A \u2248 0.519.\nThus we can observe three distinct regions: a quasiperiodic attractor for A < 0.519, an\nSNA for 0.519 < A < 0.7875, and a chaotic attractor for A > 0.7875. We now consider\nthe dynamical properties of the attractor inside these regions.\nSince the system (1) is passive, its dynamics is in the main formed by the external\nforcing. The external force (dashed line of Fig. 2) can be considered as a periodic field with\na slowly-varying amplitude. Thus the motion can be either stable or unstable, depending\non the instantaneous amplitude, and it becomes unstable if the amplitude exceeds some\nthreshold. Thus, with the growth of amplitude, the proportion of unstable motion in the\ntotal system dynamics will increase. We have calculated the local (finite-time) largest\nLyapunov exponents [12, 16, 19] as\n\u039b(t\u2032, T ) =\n1\nT\nln\n|\u2206(t\u2032 + T )|\n|\u2206(t\u2032)| ,\nwhere |\u2206(t)| =\n\u221a\n\u03b4x2(t) + \u03b4x\u02d92(t), \u03b4x and \u03b4x\u02d9 are the solutions of equation variational to\n(1), t\u2032 is the time at which an amplitude minimum of the applied quasiperiodic force\noccurs, and T = 2\u03c0\/\u03c91. The finite-time LLE correspond the local LLE of stroboscopic\n(Poincare\u00b4) map of system (1). Note that the LLE is obtained by taking the limit T \u2192\u221e.\nIt can clearly be seen in Fig. 2 that the system trajectory divides into alternating time\nregions having positive and negative local exponents [10]. The same temporal behavior of\nlocal LLEs is observed for all regimes: the torus, the SNA and the chaotic attractor [20].\nHowever, their asymptotic behavior as t\u2192\u221e differs: a torus and an SNA have negative\nLLEs, whereas a chaotic attractor has a positive one.\nThe connection between chaos and a positive sign of the LLE has been strictly proven\nonly for hyperbolic and quasihyperbolic systems [21]. For the nonhyperbolic systems with\nwhich we usually deal in practice, including the Duffing system (1), there is as yet no rig-\norous proof of such a connection. In many papers, therefore, in addition to calculating\nthe LLE, authors also explore sensitivity to initial conditions by use of a variety of more\ndirect methods [4, 9, 14, 22, 23]. For example, in [14, 23] the evolution of an ensem-\nble of initially near trajectories, characterized by the same phase of the external force,\n4\nis considered. If the nearby trajectories diverge exponentially over the entire attractor\nand, consequently, the distance between them reaches the size of the attractor, then it\ntestifies to an unpredictability of the trajectories\u2019 behavior, i.e. temporal disorder, and\nthe attractor is therefore classified as complex [24]. In the opposite case the attractor is\nnon-complex (regular). In the absence of noise a complex attractor has a positive LLE,\ni.e. it is chaotic. Following these remarks we consider the time evolution of an ensemble\nof nearby trajectories, a so-called a snapshot of slices of the attractor [14, 23]: we choose\na set of points on the phase plane x \u2212 x\u02d9 on a circle of radius 0.00001 around an attrac-\ntor point, and monitor its time evolution. To describe the evolution of the trajectory\nensemble we have calculated the dispersion Sx\u02d9(t) [14, 23], which is defined as:\nS2x\u02d9(t) =\n1\nN\nN\u2211\ni=1\n[x\u02d9i(t)\u2212 \u3008x\u02d9i(t)\u3009]2 ,\nwhere N = 500 is the number of points and \u201c\u3008.\u3009\u201d indicates an ensemble average.\nFig. 3(a) shows that, for the chaotic attractor, Sx\u02d9(t) periodically increases and de-\ncreases at frequency \u03c92\u2212\u03c91. In the time domain we can distinguish periodically alternat-\ning regions within which the size of the snapshot of slices of the attractor is qualitatively\ndifferent (Fig. 4): depending on the sign of the local LLEs, the points either diverge expo-\nnentially over the entire attractor (positive sign) or they converge in very small regions of\nthe phase plane (negative sign). Thus, in the quasiperiodically driven Duffing oscillator\nthe chaotic spreading out of trajectories has a periodic alternating character. Note that\nsimilar behavior is distinguished from typical evolutions of nearby trajectories for chaotic\nattractor, e.g. in non-quasiperiodic systems, when the value S increases from initial value,\nreaching certain maximum, but thereafter practically does not change [22].\nFor the SNA, the ensemble of trajectories converges to a single trajectory, i.e. the size\nof the slice falls from its initial value to zero during a characteristic relaxation time (Fig.\n3(b)), during which local trajectory spreading over the entire attractor occurs. It is clear\nthat if, after this relaxation period, the trajectory of the system was again perturbed,\nfurther spreading would occur. Indeed, the sum of local LLEs over the regions with\npositive sign can reach \u039bs \u223c 10 \u2212 15. Consequently, any initial perturbation exceeding\nthe value |\u03b4x0| = SA exp(\u2212\u039bs) \u223c 1.e\u2212 6 must attain the size of the attractor SA in these\nregions. Note, however, that this conclusion has a value-dependent character since, as\n5\nshown in [25], the evolution of a finite-size perturbation differs from that of the infinitly-\nsmall perturbation described by a local LLE. Hence conclusions about the evolution of\na finite-size perturbation cannot be reached without also considering the evolution of a\ntrajectory ensemble.\nFor the torus we also observe local trajectory spreading (not shown here), but the dis-\ntance between trajectories does not attain the attractor size: we recall that perturbations\nfor the torus and SNA regimes tend to zero asymptotically as t\u2192\u221e.\n3. Dynamics in the presence of noise\nIn reality, of course, we almost always deal with finite-size perturbations, because the\nfluctuations in real systems occur continuously. In the presence of fluctuations the size of\nthe perturbation cannot be less than some value related to the noise intensity [24]. In other\nwords, when we take account of fluctuations, two initially close trajectories will always\ndiffer from each other by some value; this is true even for the regular regime. Consequently,\nfor the torus, SNA and chaotic regimes, perturbations must evolve as follows: during\ntime intervals with positive local LLEs the perturbation increases exponentially, whether\nmixing or not (depending on the noise intensity); and during the time intervals with\nnegative local LLEs the perturbation decreases to a non-zero value defined by the noise\nintensity.\nWe now consider the behaviour of (1) in the presence of noise. For the sake of defi-\nniteness, we choose a noise intensity comparable with that of the weak internal noise of\nan analog electronic model of (1). Such noise originates in the analog components [26]\nand is usually at least \u223c 1 \u00b5V [26] (and often much larger than this). For our numerical\nsimulation we choose D = 0.000001.\nWe first address the question: does this weak noise change the properties of the\nattractors? To answer the question we have calculated (using the technique of [7]) the\ninformation dimension di and scaling coefficient \u03b2 of the spectral distribution function\nN(\u03c3) \u223c \u03c3\u2212\u03b2 for different regimes of the attractor, both in the presence and in the absence\nof noise. The results are shown in the Table 1. The dimension was calculated for the\nPoincare section in coordinates (x(tn), \u03b8n = (n\n\u03c92\n\u03c91\n)(mod 1)), tn = n2\u03c0\/\u03c91. The coordinate\nx(tn) was used for calculating the scaling of the spectral distribution. It can be seen in\nthe Table 1 that, for the noise-free case, there is no obvious qualitative difference between\n6\nmeasures of the SNA (A = 0.6, A = 0.7) and measures of the chaotic attractor (A = 0.8,\nA = 0.9). The behavior of the LLE (Fig. 1(a)) as a function of the forcing amplitude A in\nthe presence of noise is found to be practically coincident with that of the noise free case.\nBecause the presence of weak noise does not change these measures, we may infer that\nit does not induce new regimes. Thus, the typical scenario is that: the fractal structure\nis simply smoothed by the noise at small scales O(D), while remaining fractal on larger\nscales; and the LLE differs from its unperturbated value a quantity O(D).\nFor the classification of attractor complexity we may again use the behavior of Sx\u02d9(t):\nan attractor can be described as complex if the fluctuations of Sx\u02d9(t) with respect to the\nzero level are comparable with the size of the attractor on the phase plane. To characterize\nthe attractor\u2019s dynamical complexity as a function of A we consider the behavior of the\nmaximal dispersion Smax. It was calculated over a time interval of 500 2\u03c0\/\u03c91, following a\nrelaxation time of 1500 2\u03c0\/\u03c91. As shown in Fig. 1(b) for the noise-free case the maximal\nvalue is distinguishable from zero only in the region where the sign of the LLE is positive.\nConsequently, the behavior of Sx\u02d9(t) fully correlates with the behavior of the LLE. In the\nchaotic regime the fluctuations in Sx\u02d9(t) are comparable in size with the attractor on the\nphase plane x\u2212 x\u02d9; correspondingly, the attractor is dynamically complex. In the presence\nof noise, however, Smax differs from zero for all values of forcing amplitude and becomes\ncomparable in size with the attractor for A > 0.519 (Fig. 1(b)), i.e. over the regions\nof co-existence of the SNA and chaotic attractor in the noise-free case. Consequently,\nfor A > 0.519 in the presence of noise, the evolution of the ensemble of trajectories\nis similar to the evolution of a chaotic attractor (Fig. 3(c)) and we observe a complex\nand unpredictable behavior in (1). Note that for the noisy torus locally increasing and\ndecreasing values of S are also observed, but maximal value of S (which is determined by\nthe noise intensity) does not reach the size of attractor: see Fig. 1(a). Note also that we\ndo not observe a diffusive divergence of trajectories in the torus regime because we are\nconsidering an ensemble of trajectories with the same phase of the eternal force.\n4. Discussion\nIt is thus clear that, in the quasiperiodically driven Duffing oscillator, extremely weak\nnoise is sufficient to convert an SNA into an attractor that is strange in the sense of having\na fractal structure, and complex in the sense that there is unpredictability of trajectory\n7\nbehavior during some time intervals, but which has a negative LLE. This implies that\nuse of the LLE as an indicator of the velocity of perturbation growth yields misleading\ninformation about the dynamical properties of the attractors. We have therefore also\ncalculated the complexity measure K\u03c3, which was introduced [24] for the analysis of\nchaotic systems in the presence of fluctuations. It defines the velocity of divergence of\nnearby trajectories and is calculated for two trajectories with different noisy realizations.\nFor regular motion, K\u03c3 = 0, but K\u03c3 differs from zero in the complex regime. In the\nnoise-free case the value of K\u03c3 is positive for a chaotic attractor and zero for a regular\nattractor. It can be seen (Fig. 5) that, for (1) the complexity differs from zero in the\nregions where an SNA and chaos exist in the noise-free system, and that K\u03c3 = 0 in the\nregion of torus. This reinforces our conclusion that, for A > 0.519 in the presence of noise,\nthe motion is complex.\nWe have evidence to show that this conclusion is not restricted to the Duffing sys-\ntem (1): we have investigated [20] the effect of noise on the SNA-displaying nonlinear\noscillators and maps described in [8, 9, 13, 15]. The results have turned out to be quali-\ntatively similar to those described above for (1). Thus, in each case, an extremely small\nnoise intensity is sufficient to convert the SNA into a complex attractor, but without\naltering either its geometrical properties, or the scaling of the spectral function, or the\nsign of the LLE. It is important to note that the role of noise here (in contrast to some\nother well-known cases [27]) is trivial: the noise simply defines the finite (nonzero) size\nof the perturbation or, in other words, the finite uncertainty in the definition of initial\nconditions.\nThe same results for measures S and K\u03c3 are obtained if we examine the deterministic\n(without noise) behavior, just forbidding the distance between trajectories of ensemble to\nbe less then some value \u01eb. Thus, the observed effects of noise are defined by the properties\nof the SNA and are displayed only if the noise amplitude is larger then some threshold\nvalue \u01eb.\n5. Conclusion\nIn summary, we are apparently driven to the conclusion that, in the presence of ex-\ntremely weak noise, an SNA retains its negative LLE but exhibits complex unpredictable\nbehavior and a fractal structure \u2013 just like a chaotic attractor \u2013 even though weak noise\n8\nchanges neither the SNA structure nor the relationship between the regions with diver-\ngence and convergence of trajectories. It is therefore impossible to classify the complexity\nof signals from such systems usefully in terms of their time-averaged LLEs. Rather, it\nis necessary to use local LLEs, a measure of complexity [24], or a direct method such as\nmaximal velocity dispersion of an ensemble of trajectories, in order to examine the un-\npredictability of motion. Thus, one needs to know both the averaged LLE or distribution\nof local LLEs [28], and the temporal behavior of local LLEs, to evaluate the region with\ninstability.\nFinally, it is interesting to note that, in pioneering [4] and early papers on the subject,\nthe appearance of an SNA is attributed to unstable sets. Moreover, J. Stark [29] has shown\ntheoretically that an SNA has non-stable orbits, giving rise to its fractal structure. Non-\nstable orbits must also cause unstable dynamical behavior. If we compare the dependences\non A of the fractal dimension DF and the measure of complexity K\u03c3 (see Fig. 5), it is\nevident that they are qualitatively similar. Thus we can suggest that the SNA appears to\nhave as much dynamical complexity in the presence of weak noise as it has strangeness in\nthe noise-free case. This interesting question will be considered in more detail elsewhere.\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge valuable discussions with O. V. Sosnovtseva and D.\nG. Luchinsky.
