Introduction\n[2] It is widely believed that reactivated crustal-scale fault\nzones are weak relative to adjacent regions of intact rock.\nSuch fault zones often contain exhumed fault rock suites\nwith textures that preserve valuable information about the\ndeformation mechanisms operating at depth in both ancient\nand modern settings [e.g., Sibson, 1977; Schmid and Handy,\n1991; Holdsworth et al., 2001]. Recent field-based research\nalong major faults [e.g., Imber et al., 2001; Stewart et al.,\n2000; Gueydan et al., 2003; Collettini and Holdsworth,\n2004; Wibberley, 2005] has focused on the importance of\nfoliated, fine-grained phyllosilicate-rich fault rocks, or phyl-\nlonites, formed close to the main load-bearing region of the\ncrust at the frictional-viscous transition (i.e., 8\u201315 km\ndepths). The textural sequences preserved in these rocks\nare similar to those developed during analogue deforma-\ntion experiments on fine-grained \u2018\u2018fault rocks\u2019\u2019 [e.g., Bos\nand Spiers, 2000, 2002; Bos et al., 2000a, 2000b]. These\nexperimental results predict a profound and long-term\nweakening of faults that develop phyllonites and provide\nexplanations for reactivated faults, low-angle normal\nfaults and anomalously weak, plate boundary structures\n[Holdsworth, 2004].\n[3] Foliated brittle fault rocks have been recognized along\nmany major crustal discontinuities [e.g., Chester et al.,\n1985, 1993; Chester and Logan, 1986] and are generally\nthought to have formed at \u000110 km depth. They have been\nreproduced also experimentally [e.g., Yund et al., 1990;\nBeeler et al., 1996]. The rheological significance of such\nfoliated brittle fault rocks is rather poorly understood,\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, B12303, doi:10.1029\/2005JB004205, 2006\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Reactivation Research Group, Department of Earth Sciences, Uni-\nversity of Durham, Durham, England, UK.\n2Department of Geology and Mineralogy, Graduate School of Science,\nKyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.\n3Department of Earth Science, Waseda University, Shinjuku, Tokyo,\nJapan.\n4Department of Earth Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.\n5HPT Laboratory, Department of Earth Sciences, Utrecht University,\nUtrecht, Netherlands.\nCopyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/06\/2005JB004205$09.00\nB12303 1 of 17\nalthough they are thought to be associated with fault zone\nweakening [e.g., Chester, 1995] with evidence for both\ngrain-scale reaction softening and the operation of fluid-\nassisted diffusional mechanisms in many cases [e.g., Evans\nand Chester, 1995]. The present study focuses on the\ndevelopment of foliated cataclasite and gouge along the\nMedian Tectonic Line (MTL), Nagano Prefecture, SW\nJapan (Figure 1a). The development of the foliated cata-\nclasites is compared with that of phyllonites from a more\ndeeply exhumed section of the MTL and with expectations\nbased on a recent, crustal-scale, fault strength model. The\ncomparison is used to discuss the implications for fault\nzone rheology and to test the hypothesis that the foliated\ncataclastic rocks at Nagano are shallower crustal equivalents\nof the phyllonitic sequences recognized elsewhere along the\nMTL.\n2. Geological and Structural Setting\n[4] The MTL is a major crustal-scale fault with a strike\nlength of >1000 km and a displacement history originating\nin the early Cretaceous. Displacement estimates are poorly\nconstrained, ranging from 200 to 1000 km [Ichikawa,\n1980]. Today, the MTL has a steep to subvertical dip and\nforms the boundary between the low-P\/high-T Ryoke meta-\nmorphic belt of granitoids and metasedimentary rocks to the\nnorth and the high-P\/low-T Sambagawa belt of accretionary\ncomplex metasedimentary rocks to the south (Figure 1a).\nThe fault zone displays a wide variety of fault rocks\ngenerated at different levels in the midcrust to upper crust,\nnow exhumed as a consequence of continued activity, uplift\nand fault reactivation.\n[5] Within the Ryoke Belt (Figure 1a), a broad (up to\n5 km wide) zone of mylonitization formed during sinistral\ntop-to-south shearing in the late Cretaceous to earliest\nTertiary [Ito, 1978] when the MTL was a shallowly inclined\nstructure. A later and narrower central or \u2018\u2018core\u2019\u2019 region of\nsinistral strike-slip displacements formed during the early\nTertiary on a steeply dipping MTL [e.g., Ichikawa, 1980;\nHara et al., 1980; Ohtomo, 1993]. This deformation\nbecomes increasingly brittle, with the development of\nfoliated cataclasites, breccias and gouges, as the fault core\nis approached [e.g., Takagi, 1984, 1986; Wibberley and\nShimamoto, 2003; Jefferies et al., 2006]. A subsequent\ndextral strike-slip reactivation, with displacements localized\nwithin incohesive and phyllosilicate-rich fault rocks typi-\ncally found within 10 m of the central slip zone, is\nrecognized on the southwestern parts of the MTL [e.g.,\nOkada, 1980; Wibberley and Shimamoto, 2003; Jefferies et\nal., 2006].\n[6] In Nagano Prefecture, the MTL runs approximately\nN-S with a subvertical dip (Figures 1a and 2a) and is cut out\nto the north by the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL)\n[Takagi, 1986]. The present paper focuses on fault rocks\nderived from the Ryoke belt, which comprises amphibolite-\nfacies psammitic and pelitic schists, with variable mica\ncontent, and subordinate units of tonalitic orthogneiss\n[Ohtomo, 1993; Yamamoto, 1994]. These rocks character-\nistically contain white mica, biotite, quartz, plagioclase,\ngarnet, sillimanite and andalusite [Yamamoto, 1994]. A\nmid-Cretaceous (circa 100 Ma) age estimate for this\nregional metamorphism has been suggested using radiomet-\nric age data and geological evidence [Suzuki and Adachi,\n1998]. The Sambagawa belt in Negano Prefecture is com-\nposed mainly of greenschist facies pelites and minor basic\nschists [Takagi, 1986].\n[7] The Hiji tonalitic gneiss body in the Nagano Pre-\nfecture is the oldest of the granitic rocks in the Ryoke Belt\nwith a mid-Cretaceous (circa 95 Ma) age of emplacement\n[Suzuki and Adachi, 1998]. It consists of quartz, plagio-\nclase, K-feldspar, biotite and hornblende in varying pro-\nportions and toward the center of the body develops a\ngneissose banding trending subparallel (010\u0001\u2013040\u0001) to the\nMTL with steeply west dipping to subvertical orientations\n[Takagi, 1986]. Adjacent to the MTL, the tonalitic gneiss\nhas been deformed into a zone of subvertical mylonites up\nto 1 km wide with ubiquitous sinistral shear criteria\n[Takagi, 1984, 1986]. The effects of brittle sinistral defor-\nmation are localized in the fault core region, within which\ncataclastic rocks, many of them foliated, are derived from\nthe mylonites as subvertical intercalated belts locally up to\n200 m wide.\n[8] The present study was carried out on a \u0002240 m NE-\nSW section of the MTL fault core well exposed by a\ntributary of the Aokigawa River in the Anko region\n(Figures 1 and 2) [Tanaka et al., 1996]. The boundary\nbetween the (often foliated) Ryoke-derived cataclastic rocks\nin the fault core and the Ryoke-derived mylonites that lie to\nthe west is not exposed. The Sambagawa rocks along this\nsection comprise generally poorly exposed black (pelitic)\nand green (basic) schists [Takagi, 1986; Tanaka et al., 1996]\nand are not discussed in this paper.\n3. MTL Fault Core, Anko Section\n3.1. Field Relationships and Mesostructures\n3.1.1. Faults\n[9] The Anko section is cut by at least two generations of\nmesoscale faults that appear to postdate all other structures,\nincluding foliated cataclasites in the fault core. The earlier\nfault set are more significant in terms of displacement as\nthey intercalate fault rocks derived from both Ryoke and\nSambagawa protoliths in a 20\u201330 m wide central region of\nthe fault core (Figures 1b, 2a, and 3a). These faults strike N-\nS at low angles to the MTL, with steep dips and shallowly\nplunging slickenlines consistent with strike-slip movements\n(Figures 1c and 2, left). No unambiguous senses of shear\ncould be determined where slickenlines are preserved in\nexposed fault surfaces. Associated with many of these late\nbrittle faults is a zone of hydrothermal alteration up to 1 m\nwide where the fault rocks exhibit a \u2018\u2018bleached\u2019\u2019 appear-\nance. Narrow (<10 cm wide) carbonate-cemented, unfoli-\nated gouges are developed along these faults (Figure 3b)\ntogether with late Fe-staining and pyrite mineralization. A\nlater generation of moderately dipping reverse faults trend-\ning ENE and dipping south (Figure 2b, left), crosscut all\nother structures [see Tanaka et al., 1996] and are associated\nwith minor sulphide mineralization.\n3.1.2. Ryoke Mylonites\n[10] Mylonitized Ryoke psammitic and pelitic rocks crop\nout toward the southwestern end of the Anko section,\nintersliced with units of foliated quartzo-feldspathic cata-\nclasite (Figure 1b). They are fine grained (\u00020.05\u20130.1 mm)\nand commonly exhibit a distinctive orange and black\nB12303 JEFFERIES ET AL.: FOLIATED CATACLASITES IN FAULTS\n2 of 17\nB12303\nF\nig\nu\nre\n1\n.\n(a\n)\nM\ned\nia\nn\nT\nec\nto\nn\nic\nL\nin\ne\n(M\nT\nL\n),\nS\nW\nJa\np\nan\n,\nsh\no\nw\nin\ng\nad\nja\nce\nn\nt\nm\net\nam\no\nrp\nh\nic\nb\nel\nts\n.\nIS\nT\nL\n=\nIt\no\nig\naw\na-\nS\nh\niz\nu\no\nk\na\nT\nec\nto\nn\nic\nL\nin\ne.\n(b\n)\nS\nim\np\nli\nfi\ned\ng\neo\nlo\ng\nic\nal\nm\nap\no\nf\nA\nn\nk\no\nse\nct\nio\nn\no\nf\nM\nT\nL\nfa\nu\nlt\nco\nre\n[a\nft\ner\nT\na\nn\na\nka\net\na\nl.\n,\n1\n9\n9\n6\n].\n(c\n)\nP\nh\no\nto\ng\nra\np\nh\no\nf\na\nse\nct\nio\nn\no\nf\nfa\nu\nlt\nco\nre\n,\nlo\no\nk\nin\ng\nN\nE\n.\nB12303 JEFFERIES ET AL.: FOLIATED CATACLASITES IN FAULTS\n3 of 17\nB12303\nbanded appearance due to Fe staining of the more\nquartzo-feldspathic psammitic layers (Figure 3c) and very\nfine grained (<0.05 mm) black micaceous pelitic layers,\nrespectively. The interbanding of orange and black units\nis developed on tens of centimeter- to submillimeter\nscales and appears to be a relict compositional layering\ntransposed almost entirely into concordance with the\nstrong mylonitic foliation (Figure 3c). The foliation has\na uniform orientation (mean 019\/78W) with a mineral\nlineation defined by mica and elongated quartz plunging\nshallowly toward either the NNE or SSW (Figure 2b,\nmiddle). Intrafolial isoclinal folds are locally present, but\nfew hinge lines actually exposed. Where they can be\nmeasured, fold hinges are upright with shallow to mod-\nerate NNE plunges hinges (Figure 2b, middle). These\nfolds appear to have formed during intense ductile\nshearing associated with mylonitization. Late calcite\nveins, <1 cm wide, occur also and crosscut the mylonite\nfabric.\n3.1.3. Quartzo-Feldspathic Cataclasite\n[11] The quartzo-feldspathic cataclasite crops out in a\n\u000210 m wide zone (Figure 1b) and is derived from Ryoke\ntonalitic mylonite. Few original features are visible due to\npervasive grain-scale crushing, but the rock is composed of\na mixture of protocataclasite and variably foliated ultra-\ncataclasite (Figure 3d). In the protocataclasite sections,\nfeldspar grains reach up to \u00021.2 mm and in isolated regions,\nthe relict mylonitic foliation remains visible. The ultra-\ncataclasites are dark gray-black and individual grains are\nundistinguishable.\n3.1.4. Quartzo-Feldspathic Foliated Cataclasite With\nClasts of Fractured Mylonite\n[12] This fault rock is continually exposed in a 40 m long\nsection west of the central fault core (Figure 1b). It is\nFigure 2. (a) Schematic three-dimensional sketch of MTL section shown in Figure 1a showing fault and\nfoliation geometries in region west of the River Aokigawa.

Finer-grained regions display a crude\nmesoscopic foliation defined by the preferential alignment\nof an anastomosing and coalescing network of fracture\nsurfaces with centimeter- to submillimeter spacing\n(Figures 3e\u20133f). A weak to moderately strong ultrafine\nfoliation oriented subparallel to the fracture foliation is\ndeveloped also. Collectively, the foliations strike approxi-\nmately NNE-SSWwith a steep to vertical dip. A fine mineral\nlineation, defined by aligned chlorite grains, plunges gently\nto moderately NNE or SSW (Figure 2b, right). Clasts in the\nless deformed light gray cataclasites reach up to \u00021 mm,\nwhile individual grains in the ultracataclasites often cannot be\ndistinguished. Thin (millimeter to submillimeter) seams of\nultracataclasite lie along many fracture surfaces that define\nthe mesoscale foliation (Figure 3f), and also locally form\ncrosscutting veins (Figure 3e) consistent with injection of\nmobilized material into voids during deformation. Open to\ntight centimeter-scale folds are present locally in sections\nwhere the mesoscopic foliation is most intensely developed,\nwhich suggests that foliation development is associated with\nthe onset of mesoscopic cataclastic flow, although no con-\nsistent hinge orientation or sense of vergence is preserved in\nthe available exposures.\n[13] Lenticular clasts of relict gray mylonitic tonalite up\nto 3 m across and 5 m long are widely preserved and are\nwrapped by the cataclasite foliation (Figures 1b, 3e, and 3g).\nThey are internally disrupted by networks of brittle fractures,\nsome of which are associated with well-developed seams of\nfoliated ultracataclasite up to 10 cm wide. Within the center\nof some larger tonalitic clasts, cataclasis is limited and good\nmylonitic textures are preserved (Figure 3h). Elongate feld-\nspar porphyroclasts up to 5 mm long are aligned parallel to\nthemylonitic foliation in the fine-grained quartz-micamatrix.\nA compositional layering defined by alternating quartz-rich\nand quartz-poor bands lies parallel to the mylonitic folia-\ntion. Toward the edges of the large clasts, the intensity of\ncataclasis increases and mylonitic textures are progressively\nobliterated.\n3.1.5. Orange-Black Quartzose Foliated Cataclasite\nand Gouge\n[14] This very distinctive unit crops out mainly in the\ncentral region of the fault core where it is intercalated\nwith orange-stained cataclasite and units derived from\nSambagawa schists (Figure 1b). The meter to submillimeter\ninterbanding of orange and black units (Figures 1c and 4a)\nappears to resemble the Ryoke psammitic and pelitic\nmylonites that outcrop upstream (Figure 4a), but the coarser\n(up to \u00021 mm) grained bands of Fe-oxide-stained orange\ncataclasite contain no visible feldspar and appear to be\ncomposed almost entirely of quartz and subordinate car-\nbonate. The black bands form a closely spaced, anastomos-\ning and coalescing network of extremely fine grained\nfoliated ultracataclasites (Figure 4b), although the textures\nand mineralogy cannot be resolved in the field. The folia-\ntion is consistently steeply dipping to subvertical, but varies\nin strike from N-S to NE-SW. An associated mineral\nlineation defined by aligned chlorite grains plunges shal-\nlowly to moderately S-SW or N-NE (Figure 2b, right). The\nvariations in strike appear to reflect the development of\nsinistral shear band structures on centimeter to meter scales,\nwith regions of NE-SW trending foliation having undergone\nsmall clockwise back rotation between N-S trending higher\nstrain zones (e.g., see Figure 4c).\n[15] Field evidence suggests that the formation of the\ndark ultracataclasite localizes along fractures with cm to\nsubmillimeter spacing (Figure 4b). The foliation is defined\nby the parallel alignment of grains and a dense, closely\nspaced fracture network. The dark seams and associated\nfractures crosscut the orange quartzose layers and clasts and\nappear to break them down from the edges inward to form\ntypically elongate quartz clasts that appear to be being\nsmeared within the foliation due to the effects of cataclastic\nflow (Figure 4b). Injection seams of dark ultracataclasite\ncutting across orange quartzose cataclasites are common\nand are locally folded and flattened parallel to the foliation\n(Figure 4d).\n[16] Centimeter-scale Riedel-type shears, coated with\ndark ultracataclasites, are widely developed and lie anti-\nclockwise at angles of up to \u000245\u0001 to the crude foliation,\nconsistent with sinistral shear (Figure 4b). Locally, the\nshears and foliated dark ultracataclasite are folded by\nirregular centimeter-scale open to tight folds (Figure 4e)\nwith variable orientations.\n[17] The orange black quartzose foliated cataclasite ap-\npear to lose coherency to form gouges with a pervasive flow\nfoliation adjacent to intercalated units of other fault rock\ntypes (Figures 4c, 4f, and 4g). Relict clasts of quartzose\ncataclasite and pale carbonate up to 10 cm across are locally\npreserved strongly wrapped by the foliation. The wrapping\nis often slightly asymmetric and, together with the local\ndevelopment of centimeter-spaced shear bands oriented\nanticlockwise to the foliation, suggest a sinistral shear sense\n(Figures 4b, 4f, and 4g). The foliation is locally folded by\ncentimeter-scale tight to isoclinal folds with mainly sub-\nvertical plunges that most likely formed due to strike-slip\nshearing, although a consistent sense of vergence could not\nbe ascertained. Fold hinges are often thickened, with\npinching and shearing out of fold limbs by fractures and\nassociated ultracataclasite seams.\n[18] The highly foliated gouges characteristically pre-\nserve interlinked vein networks of white and orange car-\nFigure 3.

The veins anastomose and coalesce and are\npreferentially aligned subparallel to the foliation, although\nthey locally crosscut and therefore postdate this fabric\n(Figures 4f\u20134g). Regions of foliated gouge adjacent to\norange Ryoke-Sambagawa contacts appear to have been\nparticularly incohesive, with evidence of cuspate-lobate\nboundaries between units of Ryoke- and Sambagawa-de-\nrived gouge. In some localities, black Sambagawa-derived\ngouge appears to have been injected into orange Ryoke-\nderived units (Figure 4h).\n3.1.6. Gray-Green and Orange-Stained Cataclasites\n[19] Both these fault rocks units are essentially unfoliated.\nThe pale gray-green cataclasite crops out in two fault-\nbounded slices (Figures 1b and 2a). It appears to be derived\nfrom a Ryoke quartzo-feldspathic mylonite as mylonitic\nfoliation and feldspar porphyroclasts up to 0.6 mm across\nremain visible. A few weakly foliated and extremely fine\ngrained ultracataclasite bands have formed along some\nfractures. The orange-stained cataclasite occurs primarily\nin the central region of the fault core intercalated with the\norange-black quartzose foliated cataclasite (Figures 1b\nand 2a). It is distinctive as it lacks any foliation. The orange\ncolor appears to result from the weathering out of iron\noxide. It is relatively incohesive with a grain size <1 mm\nand no features or textures are recognizable.\n3.1.7. Fault Rock Sequence\n[20] The mylonites derived from Ryoke protoliths are\nconsistently the earliest recognized fault rocks preserved.\nThey are heterogeneously overprinted by the effects of\nincreasingly pervasive brittle fracturing, which develop\ncataclasites and foliated ultracataclasites. The latter are\nlocalized initially along fractures aligned parallel to the\nMTL leading to a crude mesoscale foliation, which is\naugmented by a subparallel ultrafine-grained fabric. The\ndevelopment of injection veins and irregular folds points to\nthe localized onset of cataclastic flow. With increased\ndeformation, the ultracataclasites become dominant and lose\ncohesion to form flow-banded, locally injected foliated\ngouge. Episodic carbonate veining is associated with, and\nreworked by, every stage of cataclastic deformation and\neventually becomes focused in the most intensely deformed\nfoliated gouges.\n[21] The unfoliated orange and gray-green cataclasites are\nproblematic in terms of their relative age. There is no clear\nevidence to suggest that they derived from later reworking\nof foliated cataclasites at shallower depths. However, while\ngray-green cataclasite preserves only relict mylonitic tex-\ntures, the incipient development of ultracataclasite seams\nsuggests that they may represent regions of ?strain hardened\ncataclasite effectively \u2018\u2018frozen in\u2019\u2019 and little affected by the\nlater localization of shearing and development of foliated\ncataclasite and gouge in adjacent units.\n[22] Finally, at least two later phases of brittle faulting\nsignificantly disrupt and interslice the preexisting fault rock\nunits in the MTL core. Both events are associated with late\ncarbonate and local sulphide mineralization.\n3.2. Mineralogy and Microstructures\n3.2.1. Ryoke Mylonites\n[23] The mylonites derived from metamorphosed Ryoke\npsammites and pelites are composed of alternating domains\nwith differing quartz-mica contents. The black bands visible\nin outcrop are composed predominantly of very fine grained\n(<0.05 mm) quartz (\u000260%) and mica (\u000240%) with no\nporphyroclasts (Figure 4j). The orange colored bands con-\nsist of a fine-grained (\u00020.05\u20130.1 mm) recrystallized quartz-\nrich matrix with \u000220% white mica and chlorite (Figure 4i).\nThe coarser-grained (up to 0.7 mm in length) white micas\nexhibit mica-fish consistent with sinistral shear (Figure 4j).\nPlagioclase and K-feldspar porphyroclasts (up to 1 mm in\nlength) and fractured garnet porphyroclasts (\u00020.5 mm in\nlength) are common within the quartz-rich layers (Figure 4i).\nThe feldspars show strained and sweeping extinction patterns,\ndeformation twins and slight asymmetry (Figures 4i\u20134j),\nindicating limited ductile sinistral shear deformation. Thin\n(<0.1 mm wide) shear zones lined with very finely commi-\nnuted white mica run parallel or at low angles to the mylonitic\nfoliation and are often localized along compositional bound-\naries or the tails of wrapped porphyroclasts and mica fish\n(Figures 4i\u20134j). The deformation textures and stable miner-\nalogy of quartz-albite-white mica-chlorite suggests that\nmylonitization occurred under (lower) greenschist-facies\nmetamorphic conditions.\n[24] Greenschist-facies mylonitic fabrics are well pre-\nserved also in the central parts of tonalite clasts within the\nquartzo-feldspathic foliated cataclasite (Figure 4k). Plagio-\nFigure 4. (a) Plan view of orange-black quartzose foliated cataclasite.

The\nmylonitic foliation wrapping around these porphyroclasts\nis defined by recrystallized quartz and biotite (often\n>0.05 mm). The quartz shows evidence of subgrain rotation\nand grain boundary migration recrystallization, with ribbons\nup to 1 mm in length having developed. Finely comminuted\nbiotite is often localized within very thin (<0.1 mm across)\nshear zones oriented subparallel or at low angles to the\nmylonitic foliation. Isolated examples of highly fractured\ngarnet porphyroclasts (\u00020.7\u20131 mm in length) occur break-\ning down to biotite (Figure 4k). The local preservation of\nbiotite as a stable synkinematic reaction product may\nindicate that the mylonites at least initially developed under\nmidgreenschist facies metamorphic conditions.\n3.2.2. Quartzo-Feldspathic Cataclasite and Foliated\nCataclasite\n[25] These rocks are predominantly protocataclasites\ncomposed of highly fractured clasts of quartz, albite, K-\nfeldspar and calcite \u00020.06\u20131.2 mm in length (e.g.,\nFigures 4l, 5a, and 5b). The feldspars are altered typically\nto white mica along cleavage and fracture planes\n(Figure 5b). The matrix represents \u000225% of the protocata-\nclasite and consists of fine-grained (<0.5 mm) quartz, kao-\nlinite, calcite, chlorite and a Fe-rich dolomitic carbonate\n(Figures 5a\u20135b). Many clasts comprising fragments of albite\nor quartz are net veined by calcite (Figure 5b) and may be\nreworked equivalents to the calcite veins observed crosscut-\nting the mylonites. There is only very limited development of\na foliation, defined by the weak alignment of chlorite grains.\n[26] Up to 3 mm thick ultracataclasite bands (85\u201390%\n\u00025\u201310 mm matrix) are defined in part by dense clusters of\nparallel to subparallel fractures lined with ultrafine-grained\nmaterial stained with Fe-oxide (Figure 4m). The clasts\n(\u000210\u2013100 mm in length) consist of quartz, albite (highly\naltered to white mica) and calcite and sit in a very fine\ngrained (<5\u201310 mm) foliated matrix of chlorite (\u000210\u201315%)\nand apparently later Fe-rich dolomitic carbonate (70\u201375%),\nplus quartz, kaolin, white mica and Fe-oxide (Figures 5c\nand 5d). The foliation is defined primarily by an inter-\nconnected network of aligned and extremely fine grained\n(\u000210 mm in length) phyllosilicates (mainly chlorite, see\nFigure 5c), which form an interconnected network only\nwithin the finest-grained sections of the ultracataclasite.\nChlorite also often forms beard-like overgrowths adjacent\nto angular clasts of quartz (Figure 5d). Pressure solution\nseams are developed locally within the finest grained\nsections of the cataclasite, especially at the margins of\nfoliated ultracataclasite seams (Figure 4n). Much of the\ncarbonate mineralization is Fe-rich dolomite and together\nwith chlorite makes up most (70\u201375%) of the ultracatacla-\nsite matrix. As the calcite vein material that cuts quartz and\nfeldspar clasts (Figure 5b) is clearly entrained as clasts, its\nprecipitation predates the Fe-rich dolomite surrounding\nthese clasts.\n3.2.3. Orange-Black Quartzose Foliated Cataclasite\nand Gouge\n[27] Relict textures comparable to those found in the\nquartzo-feldspathic mylonites are preserved locally in the\norange colored quartzose layers. Recrystallized quartz\ngrains (\u00020.05\u20130.1 mm) wrap around fractured relics of\nfeldspar porphyroclasts (<1 mm) that are now mostly\naltered to fine-grained aggregates of white mica and kaolin\n(Figure 6a). The rest of the cataclasite is composed of a\nmatrix of quartz, kaolinite and flecks of white mica (\u000230 mm\nin length). The latter are aligned to define a weak foliation\n(Figure 6b). A possible source for the kaolin and white mica\nis the breakdown of feldspar.\n[28] The injection veins of ultracataclasite observed in the\nfield (e.g., Figure 4d) are predominantly composed of fine-\ngrained (<10 mm) quartz, with minor Fe-oxide and carbon-\nate, but little or no feldspar. These accumulations show\nslight contrast variations due to crystallographic preferred\norientation (CPO). Clasts (up to \u00020.1 mm) of the surround-\ning cataclasite are entrained within the quartz.\n[29] The black bands in outcrop are composed of fine-\ngrained (matrix \u00025\u201310 mm) ultracataclasite. The foliation\nvisible appears to be defined by the parallel arrangement of\nfractures and associated fine-grained cataclasite material.\nCarbonate mineralization is more extensive within these\nultracataclasites (Figures 6c\u20136e).\n[30] The orange-black foliated cataclasite contains three\ntypes of carbonate: calcite, Fe-rich dolomite and siderite\n(Figures 6d and 6g). Calcite appears to be the earliest phase,\noccurring within quartz clasts (Figure 6d). Subsequently,\nextensive precipitation of Fe-rich dolomite occurred along\nfractures and within the cataclasite matrix (Figures 6b\nand 6d). Weathering out of the oxidized iron has resulted\nin Fe staining responsible for the distinctive orange color\n(Figures 4g, 6a, and 6c). Fe-rich sideritic carbonate is often\nassociated also with the Fe-rich dolomite (Figures 6d\u20136e),\nalthough its typical location toward the centers of mineral-\nized fractures suggests that it developed slightly later than\nthe dolomite. Both phases have a porous appearance and\nexhibit good rhombic crystal faces (Figure 6e), probably\ndue to precipitation into fluid-filled cavities. This implies\nthat precipitation occurred late in the fault rock development\nalthough some minor brittle fracturing of carbonate oc-\ncurred postprecipitation. Finally, net veins of Fe-oxide cut\nacross all observed cataclastic textures (Figure 6b).\n[31] The orange-black foliated gouges adjacent to faults\nthat dissect the section have higher carbonate contents\n(\u000285% compared to \u000270% in the orange and black foliated\ncataclasite). In thin section, clasts of cataclasite, including\nthe parallel arranged fractures and ultracataclasite, sit within\na predominantly carbonate matrix (Figure 6f). Within the\nFe-rich dolomite matrix angular clasts of quartz and albite\nup to 100 mm in length occur.\n3.2.4. Gray-Green and Orange-Stained Cataclasites\n[32] The majority of clasts within the gray-green catacla-\nsite are plagioclase and K-feldspar. Clasts are subangular to\nangular and range from 0.1 to 0.6 mm in length (Figure 6h).\nThe feldspar clasts are highly fractured and are breaking\ndown to fine-grained white mica, but preserve earlier ductile\ndeformation features (strained and sweeping extinction).\nThe matrix consists of quartz, white mica, chlorite, calcite\nand opaques with grain sizes \u00030.05 mm. White mica and\ncalcite accumulations both form within the matrix. There is\nlittle foliation development except in thin (<0.1 mm thick)\nisolated seams of dark ultracataclasite. In thin section, few\ntextural relationships are preserved in the orange-stained\ncataclasites as they are heavily altered to fine-grained\nB12303 JEFFERIES ET AL.: FOLIATED CATACLASITES IN FAULTS\n9 of 17\nB12303\nFigure 5.

Discussion\n[33] Figure 7 presents a summary of the fault rock suites\nrecognized in the core of the MTL in the Anko section, the\ninterpreted deformation mechanism sequence and its in-\nferred relationship to fluid influx, mineralogical changes\nand rheology.\n4.1. Brittle Deformation, Fluid Flow, and the\nDevelopment of Foliated Cataclasites\n[34] The Anko section fault rocks indicate that the Ryoke\nmetasedimentary and tonalitic protoliths were initially\nmylonitized during sinistral shear in a zone close to the\nMTL under middle to lower greenschist-facies pressure-\ntemperature conditions [cf. Hayama et al., 1963; Hayama\nand Yamada, 1980; Takagi, 1986]. Exhumation to shallower\ndepths and lower temperatures, that may or may not have\noccurred during the same prolonged phase of sinistral\ndisplacement, then led to reworking of the mylonites by\nbrittle fracturing and cataclasis. The fractures are associated\nwith the centimeter-scale development of Riedel-type brittle\nshears oriented at angles of up to 45\u0001 anticlockwise of the\nMTL. The formation of centimeter- to submillimeter-spaced\nfractures associated with faulting led to the development of\na crude mesoscale foliation oriented parallel to the MTL. As\nexplained below, this imposed an initial architectural hier-\narchy that fundamentally influenced the subsequent devel-\nopment of foliated cataclasite and gouge.\n[35] Once each initial fracture had formed, other fractures\nlocalized adjacent to the break producing bands of densely\nspaced, subparallel fractures that eventually coalesced to\nFigure 6.

These seams are found in all foliated\ncataclasites. They broaden by the progressive abrasion of\nwall rocks but rarely attain thicknesses of more than a few\nmillimeters. The onset of brittle deformation coincides with\nsignificant fluid influx due to grain-scale dilatancy associ-\nated with cataclasis. The presence of an active fluid phase is\nindicated by (1) development of early calcite veins and\nmineralized breccias in fractured mylonite and protocata-\nclasite; (2) ubiquitous breakdown of feldspar, biotite and\ngarnet to fine-grained aggregates of phyllosilicates (white\nmica, chlorite); and (3) precipitation in ultracataclasites of\nfibrous chlorite as aligned overgrowths on clasts and matrix\ngrains, leading to the rapid development of a foliation\ndefined by an interconnected network of aligned phyllosi-\nlicate aggregates (e.g., Figures 5b\u20135c). The preferential\nlocalization of chlorite precipitation within ultracataclasites\nwas promoted initially by their ultrafine grain size, which\nfavors both chemical reaction and diffusive mass transfer\n(DMT) on the grain scale and hence the limited develop-\nment of pressure solution seams (e.g., Figure 4n).\n[36] In this way, the development of the initial fault\nnetwork seems to have led to the establishment of two\ndistinct textural domains with very different deformation\nbehaviors in the MTL foliated cataclasites. The most intense\ndeformation, and therefore largest displacements, are local-\nized into a narrow, interconnected network of foliated\nultracataclasites that enclose tens of-meters to millimeter-\nscale lenticular regions of less deformed protocataclasite\n(Figures 8a and 8b). In the protocataclasite regions\n(Figure 8c), grain-scale processes were dominated by frac-\nture, rigid rotation of grain fragments and presumably limited\nfrictional sliding. In contrast, the grain-scale deformation\nmechanisms dominant in the foliated ultracataclasites\n(Figure 8d) involved significant amounts of fluid-assisted\nDMT, including grain boundary sliding and pressure solution.\n[37] Most of the later carbonate and Fe-oxide minerali-\nzation is preferentially sited within foliated ultracataclasites\nand gouge, especially the orange-black quartzose foliated\ncataclasites of the MTL core. This may reflect channeling of\nfluid flow within the foliated and fracture-bound network of\nultracataclasites (Figure 8a) or perhaps simply the high\nsurface area available for reaction\/precipitation in the ultra-\nfine cataclasites.\n4.2. Evidence for Strain Weakening\n[38] During frictional and viscous deformations, fault\nrock rheology depends upon the relative proportions of\nweak and strong phases and the connectivity of the weak\nphase [e.g., Handy, 1990, 1994]. The textures of the lower\nstrain protocataclasite regions (e.g., Figure 8c) are likely\nrepresentative of the fault zone as a whole in the first\nincrements of deformation following exhumation. Fractured\nclasts of mylonite and calcite vein\/mineral cements are\nrandomly distributed and lie in direct contact with each\nother, forming a relatively strong load-bearing framework.\n[39] Two lines of evidence suggest that the subsequent\ndevelopment of foliated ultracataclasite strands aligned\nsubparallel to the MTL led to significant weakening.\n[40] 1. Once established, much of the subsequent defor-\nmation (=displacement) localized preferentially into\nregions of foliated ultracataclasite, leading to the develop-\nFigure 7.

The foliated ultracataclasites alone display evi-\ndence of fluid assisted DMT processes on grain scales and\nthe development of an ultrafine-grained interconnected\nnetwork of strongly aligned phyllosilicates (e.g., Figures 3,\n4, and 5c). There is abundant evidence from both experi-\nmental studies [e.g., Mares and Kronenberg, 1993; Bos and\nSpiers, 2000, 2002; Bos et al., 2000a, 2000b] and natural\nphyllosilicate-bearing fault rocks [e.g., Wintsch et al., 1995;\nStewart et al., 2000; Imber et al., 2001; Collettini and\nHoldsworth, 2004] that the establishment of interconnected\nphyllosilicate layers coupled with the onset of DMT leads to a\nprofound reduction of long-term (steady state) strength. A\nmore general reaction softening effect is likely also due to the\nreplacement of strong framework silicates by weak phyllo-\nsilicates [cf. Gueydan et al., 2003], illustrated by the folding\nof crosscutting ultracataclasite seams within foliated catacla-\nsites (e.g., Figures 4d\u20134e).\n[42] In addition to the strain weakening effects, the\nconsistent association of cataclasis and (mainly carbonate)\nmineralization suggests periodic development of high pore\nfluid pressures in the fault core, which would also likely\nlead to weakening, although on shorter timescales.\n4.3. Fault Zone Rheology and Crustal Strength\n[43] While brittle processes clearly played a key role in\nthe formation and initial localization of the foliated ultra-\ncataclasite bands, the above mentioned evidence for weak-\nening through interconnected phyllosilicate foliation\ndevelopment and diffusive mass transfer suggest that ulti-\nmately it is this that controlled the longer term strength of\nthe fault core. The grain-scale overgrowth and pressure\ndissolution features widely observed in the foliated ultra-\nFigure 8.

(d) Micron-scale view of ultracataclasite. Aligned chlorite\ndevelopment is more pervasive with evidence for limited DMT (e.g., chlorite forming beard like\novergrowths adjacent to clasts). Aligned chlorite grains form an interconnected layer throughout the\nultracataclasite. Note that the interlinked nature of foliated ultracataclasite on all scales makes it likely\nthat the rheology of this fault rock dominated the overall behavior of the fault zone.\nB12303 JEFFERIES ET AL.: FOLIATED CATACLASITES IN FAULTS\n13 of 17\nB12303\ncataclasites bear a striking resemblance to the microstruc-\ntures produced in the experiments on analogue fault rocks\nreported by Bos and Spiers [2000, 2002; see also Bos et al.,\n2000a, 2000b]. On this basis, we propose that strain\nweakening and long-term (steady state) strength of the\ncataclasite bands, and hence fault core, was controlled by\nthe grain-scale mechanisms inferred to operate in the\nexperimental examples, namely, a transition from initial\ncataclasis to slip on the developing phyllosilicate foliation\nwith accommodation by cataclastic refinement and pressure\nsolution of the intervening clasts.\n[44] Bos and Spiers [2000, 2002] developed a microphys-\nical model (Bos-Spiers model) that explained the steady\nstate (large strain) slip behavior seen in their simulated fault\nexperiments and applied this to predict the long-term\nstrength of quartz-mica fault rocks under middle to upper\ncrustal conditions [Bos and Spiers, 2002; see also Niemeijer\nand Spiers, 2005]. We adopt this model (Figures 9a\u20139c) in\norder to estimate the maximum weakening likely to be\nassociated with the development of foliated cataclasites in\nthe core of crustal faults such as the MTL. In the Bos-Spiers\nmodel, deformation of the foliated quartz-phyllosilicate\nfault rock (e.g., 20 vol % muscovite or chlorite) occurs by\nfrictional slip within the phyllosilicate foliation, with\naccommodation at geometric undulations by pressure solu-\ntion of the intervening grains and\/or dilatational cataclasis\n(Figures 9a and 9b). For a matrix with a typical lognormal\ngrain size distribution, the strength of the bulk material can\nrepresented by the mechanical analogue and corresponding\nequations given in Figure 9c [see Niemeijer and Spiers,\n2005].\n[45] The model predicts that when sliding rates are high\nor temperatures low, diffusive mass transfer (pressure solu-\ntion) is too slow to accommodate slip, so that dilatational\/\ncataclastic disruption of the microstructure dominates, pro-\nducing Byerlee-type frictional behavior (friction coefficient\nm = 0.6\u20130.9). Niemeijer and Spiers [2005] recently showed\nthat this regime exhibits marked velocity weakening, in the\nterminology of the \u2018\u2018rate and state friction\u2019\u2019 or RSF theory\nof fault slip [Dieterich, 1979], and is therefore potentially\nseismogenic. At lower sliding velocities or higher temper-\natures, diffusive mass transfer (pressure solution) in the\nmatrix becomes rapid enough to accommodate slip on the\nirregular foliation without dilatation, and the shear strength\ndecreases to values determined by the stress needed to drive\nfrictional slip on the phyllosilicate foliation plus the neces-\nsary pressure solution (Figures 9b\u20139c). At still lower\nvelocities or higher temperatures, pressure solution becomes\nso easy that fault rock strength is controlled mainly by the\nresistance to frictional slip on the foliation, which is\nexpected to be relatively low (friction coefficient m =\n0.2\u20130.3). In these two latter regimes, where pressure\nsolution is an effective accommodation mechanism, a com-\nposite \u2018\u2018frictional-viscous\u2019\u2019 fault rock rheology is predicted\n[Bos et al., 2000b], whereby the shear resistance to sliding\nshows both a normal stress dependence, due to the resis-\ntance offered by frictional slip on the foliation, plus a shear\nrate dependence due to the viscous pressure solution com-\nponent of deformation. In contrast to the dilatational\/cata-\nclastic regime, frictional-viscous sliding is velocity\nstrengthening in the terminology of RSF theory, and there-\nfore stable or nonseismogenic [Niemeijer and Spiers, 2005].\nFigure 9.

The upper portion (A) of the\nprofile represents the low-temperature (velocity weakening\nor potentially seismogenic) regime described above, in\nwhich dilatational cataclastic flow dominates. This is char-\nacterized by Byerlee-type frictional behavior (m = 0.75) and\nan increase in strength up to a depth of around 2.5 km. At\ndepths in the range 2 to 5 km, portion (B) of the profile\nshows weakening of the fault rock with depth, as accom-\nmodation of slip on the foliation becomes easier due to\nthermal activation of pressure solution. At depths beyond\n5 km, the model predicts increasing strength with depth\n(portion C of the profile), as pressure solution becomes so\neasy that frictional sliding on the foliation becomes strength\ndetermining with m = 0.25. Note that portions B and C of\nthe profile correspond to velocity strengthening, hence\naseismic, frictional-viscous slip behavior. Microstructural\npredictions implied by the model are that portion A will be\ncharacterized by cataclastic microstructures, portion B by a\ntransition to foliated cataclasites with increasing evidence\nfor matrix flow by diffusive mass transfer, and portion C by\nhighly foliated, ductile-looking phyllonites [Niemeijer and\nSpiers, 2005].\n[47] Compared to a conventional crustal fault strength\nprofile constructed using Byerlee\u2019s law to describe frictional\nslip in the upper crust, plus a dislocation creep law for wet\nquartz to describe the transition to plastic flow in the\nmidcrust (Figure 10), the model predicts a 30\u201370% reduc-\ntion in steady state strength at midcrustal levels, i.e., in the\n4\u201312 km depth range. It also predicts a thinning of the\nseismogenic zone to <5 km in a mature fault free of\ngeometric asperities [Niemeijer and Spiers, 2005]. These\neffects are due to the onset at depths >3 km of frictional-\nviscous flow resulting from the combined effects of pressure\nsolution and slip on the phyllosilicate foliation. If thermally\nactivated crystal plastic or diffusional flow of the phyllosi-\nlicate phase is taken into account, the weakening predicted\nby the model would be even greater beyond 7\u201310 km depth\n[Niemeijer and Spiers, 2005]. On the other hand, if the\nfriction coefficient of phyllosilicates increases with temper-\nature and strain, reaching values of 0.4\u20130.5 under midcrus-\ntal conditions [see Mariani et al., 2006], the weakening\neffect predicted by the Bos-Spiers model (Figure 10) may\nbe reduced to perhaps 10\u201330%. Nonetheless, it seems\nreasonable to suppose that phyllosilicate production and\nthe operation of solution transfer processes in crustal fault\nzones, as a result of initial cataclasis and fluid ingress, can\nbe expected to produce significant weakening at depths of\n3\u201310 km.\nFigure 10.

(right) Corresponding strength-depth profiles for this section of the crust, assuming a strike\nslip fault, a geotherm of 25 K km\u00041 and a hydrostatic gradient of pore fluid pressure. A traditional two-\nmechanism fault strength versus depth profile is defined by Byerlee\u2019s law (m = 0.75) and a dislocation\ncreep law for wet quartz [Luan and Paterson, 1992] and is drawn assuming an average fault zone strain\nrate of 10\u000412 s\u00041. Also shown is the profile A\u2013C predicted using the microphysical model of Bos and\nSpiers [2000, 2002] [see also Niemeijer and Spiers, 2005] describing the rheology of foliated\nphyllosilicate-rich fault rocks within the core of a crustal-scale fault zone (see Figure 9). For constructing\nthis profile, a further strain rate enhancement to 10\u000410 s\u00041 is assumed, to account for the narrow\ndimensions of the fault core. The profile was constructed assuming a mean matrix grain size of 30 mm\nand microstructural parameters appropriate for a phyllosilicate content of 20% and a friction coefficient\nof 0.3. Portions A\u2013C of the Bos-Spiers strength profile correspond to the following dominant processes:\nA, dilatation\/cataclasis; B, pressure solution accommodated slip on the phyllosilicate foliation, with\npressure solution controlling strength; C, pressure solution accommodated slip on the phyllosilicate\nfoliation, with phyllosilicate friction coefficient controlling strength.\nB12303 JEFFERIES ET AL.: FOLIATED CATACLASITES IN FAULTS\n15 of 17\nB12303\n4.4. How Are Foliated Cataclasites\/Gouges Related\nto Phyllonites?\n[48] Foliated cataclastic fault rocks occur at a number of\nlocalities along the MTL (e.g., Tobe [Takagi et al., 1992];\nHiruma (H. Takagi as cited by Snoke et al. [1998]); and\nTsukide [Wibberley and Shimamoto, 2003]). Recently,\nJefferies et al. [2006] suggested that the development of\nfoliated cataclasites overprinting cataclastic fault rocks\nelsewhere in the MTL ultimately leads to the development\nof phyllonites because cataclasis in the vicinity of brittle\nfractures creates permeable pathways for the ingress of\nchemically active fluids into the fault zone. They describe\nevidence for fluid-assisted reactions in which load-bearing\nphases (e.g., feldspars) are replaced by fine-grained, foliated\naggregates of weaker phyllosilicate minerals. However, the\nextent of this alteration and the precipitation of new\nminerals are far greater compared to the Anko section,\nleading to the formation of phyllonite bands at least 15 m\nthick. There is more evidence also for the operation of fluid-\nassisted, grain size-sensitive DMT processes, especially\npressure solution, throughout the phyllonite. Nevertheless,\ncomparison with experimental studies [e.g., Bos and Spiers,\n2000, 2002], led Jefferies et al. [2006] to conclude similarly\nthat the development of phyllonite could lead to the long-\nterm weakening of the MTL and other crustal-scale faults as\ndiscussed here.\n[49] We propose that the absence of phyllonite in the\nAnko section of the MTL compared to the section described\nby Jefferies et al. [2006] occurs because it is a less deeply\nexhumed section. The two sections therefore preserve fault\nrock assemblages that formed at different depths along the\nsame fault at more or less the same time (Figure 10). This is\nsupported by the observation that cataclastic rocks in both\nsections are associated with sinistral shearing events that\noverprint and rework preexisting mylonite-ultramylonite\nsequences. Thus, although the textural sequences and min-\neralogical development of the phyllosilicate-bearing fault\nrocks are similar, the finer phyllosilicate grain sizes and the\nlesser importance of pressure solution and reaction soften-\ning at Anko is consistent with a shallower crustal location.\n5. Conclusions\n[50] Examination of the MTL fault core exposed at Anko\nshows that the development of an interconnected centime-\nter- to submillimeter-scale network of coalescing fractures\nand associated ultrafine-grained cataclasite plays a major\nrole in controlling where shear localization and weakening\noccur. Deformation mechanisms within the developing\ncataclasites and foliated cataclasites are dominated by\nfracture, frictional grain boundary sliding and cataclastic\nflow. Fluid influx initially occurred during the onset of\ncataclasis and led to a switch in dominant deformation\nmechanisms within the finest-grained sections of ultracata-\nclasite formed around the preexisting fracture network to\nfluid-assisted reaction softening and diffusive mass transfer\n(pressure solution) processes. These aided the development\nof a foliation defined by the alignment phyllosilicate (chlo-\nrite), with further chlorite growth leading to the creation of\nan interlinked network within the matrix and ultracataclasite\nstrands in the foliated cataclasite. The pattern of initial\nfracture development provided the architecture for the\ncreation of interlinked zones of fine-grained weak material\nthroughout the fault core, which dramatically altered the\nrheology of the fault core.\n[51] On textural and mineralogical grounds, the develop-\nment of foliated cataclasite and phyllonite along the MTL\nare equivalent in both space (depth) and time (Figure 10).\nThese observations are consistent with recent microphysical\nmodels [i.e., Bos and Spiers, 2000, 2002], which suggest\nthat the formation of foliated cataclasites and phyllonites\nwithin the core of large crustal-scale fault zones can\ndramatically reduce the long-term or steady state fault zone\nstrength, effectively reducing the thickness of seismogenic\nlayer to <5 km (Figure 10). On shorter timescales, the\nfracture bound network of foliated ultracataclasite and\ngouges likely acted as effective fluid seals leading to\nperiodic overpressuring, as indicated by the widespread\n(mainly carbonate) mineralization in the core of the MTL.\nThese findings have important implications for the weak-\nening of crustal-scale faults in many tectonic settings\nworldwide.\n[52] Acknowledgments.
