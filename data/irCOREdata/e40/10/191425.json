More recently, Poly (ADP-ribose) \nPolymerase (PARP), a nuclear protein which plays an essential role in DNA damage \nand repair, has also been shown to be linked to tissue damage in various pathological \nconditions and associated with oxidant stress occurring in myocardial ischemic \ninjury12,13 stroke14 and circulatory shock15. It may be expected that PARP inhibition \nwill reduce myocardial ischemic injury, however, the role of PARP in the presence of \npathological conditions such as diabetes needs to be clarified. \n \n 5\nThe aims of the present studies performed in the human myocardium were to \nelucidate the role of diabetes on the degree of cell death by apoptosis and necrosis in \nthe non-ischemic and in the ischemic tissue. In addition, the role played by caspases \nand PARP activation in ischemia\/reperfusion induced cell death was investigated. \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nPatients \nThe right atrial appendage from patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass \ngraft surgery was retrieved at the time of the right atrial cannulation. For this, local \nethical approval and patients\u2019 informed consent was obtained (Leicestershire \nResearch Ethics Committee reference no. 7805). Diabetic and non-diabetic patients \n(n=8\/group) undergoing elective cardiac surgery were included in the study. Patients \nwith atrial fibrillation, poor ejection fraction (EF<30%), mitral and\/or tricuspid valve \npathology, those taking potassium channel openers (nicorandil or diazoxide) and \npatients undergoing emergency cardiac surgery were excluded.  Blood glucose levels \nwere well controlled before surgery in the participants with insulin-dependent and \ninsulin-independent diabetes and they were kept within the physiological range during \nsurgery in all study patients with and without diabetes. \n \nExperimental Preparation and Solutions \nThe sectioning of the atrial muscle and the simulated ischemia\/reoxygenation \npreparation has been previously described.16   Briefly, the atrial muscles were \ntransferred from the operating theatre to the laboratory immersed in cold (4oC) buffer \nsolution in a time under 2 minutes.  The appendages were then mounted onto a ground \nglass plate with the epicardial surface face down and then sliced freehand with the use \nof surgical skin graft blades (Swan-Morton, Sheffield, UK) to a thickness of between \n300 and 500\u03bcm.  The muscles (weight 30-50mg) were transferred to conical flasks \n 6\n(25mL Erlenmeyer flasks Schott Glaswerk, Mainz, Germany) containing 10mL of \noxygenated buffered solution (see below for composition), and the flasks were placed \nin a shaking water bath maintained at 37oC.  Following this the muscles were \nequilibrated for 30 minutes in oxygenated (95% O2 \/ 5% CO2) Krebs Henseleit Hepes \n(KHH) buffered solution containing (in mM): NaCl (118), KCl (4.8), NaHCO3 (27.2), \nMgCl2 (1.2), KH2PO4 (1.0), CaCl2 (1.20), glucose.H2O (10), HEPES (20) at a pH of \n7.4. The buffer was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS: Harlanseralabs \n#S-0001A). For the induction of simulated ischemia, the media was bubbled with \n95% N2 \/ 5% C02 (pH 6.80-7.00) in the absence of glucose. \n \nExperimental Protocols \nStudy 1: Degree of apoptosis and necrosis in the non-ischemic fresh \ndiabetic myocardium \nApoptosis, necrosis and initiator (including caspases-2,-8,-9 and -10) and effector \ncaspase (including caspases -3, -6 and -7) activation were assessed  in non-ischemic \nfresh atrial muscles from patients without diabetes and with NIDDM and IDDM \n(n=8\/group).   \n \nStudy 2: Effect of ischemia\/reoxygenation in the diabetic myocardium \nThe atrial muscles (n=8\/group) from non-diabetic, NIDDM and IDDM patients were \nequilibrated for 30 minutes and then subjected to the following two experimental \nprotocols: (i) aerobic perfusion for 210 minutes; (ii) 90 minutes of simulated ischemia \nfollowed by 120 minutes of reoxygenation (SI\/R). CK release was measured in the \nincubation media during the 120 minutes of reoxygenation or during the last 120 \nminutes of aerobic incubation in the controls and the tissue was taken at the end of \nprotocols for the assessment of tissue viability, cell apoptosis and necrosis and \ninitiator and effector caspase activation. \n 7\n \nStudy 3: The role of caspases and PARP in cell death in the diabetic \nmyocardium \nSections of atrial muscle (n=6) from non-diabetic, NIDDM and IDDM patients were \nequilibrated for 30 minutes and then subjected to the following protocols: (i) aerobic \nperfusion for 210 minutes; (ii) 90 minutes SI followed by 120 minutes R; (iii) SI\/R \nwith caspase-3 inhibitor z.DEVD.fmk (70nM); (iv) SI\/R with different concentrations \nof the caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVAD.fmk (0, 0.02, 0.2, and 2\u00b5M); (v) SI\/R with \ndifferent concentrations of the  PARP inhibitor PJ-34 (0, 0.07, 0.7, and 7\u00b5M). The \ncaspase and PARP inhibitors were incubated with the muscles for the entire \nexperimental period. As in the previous protocol, CK release was measured in the \nincubation media and cell apoptosis and necrosis were assessed in the muscles at the \nend of the protocols. \n \nAssessment of tissue injury and viability \nCK release into the perfusate during the 120 minutes of reoxygenation was measured \nas an index of tissue injury. The enzyme activity was measured by a linked-enzyme \nkinetic assay according to the manufacturers instruction (DG147-K: Sigma \nChemicals, Perth, Australia) and expressed as IU\/g wet weight.  \n \nTissue viability was assessed by the mitochondrial reduction of 3-[4, 5 \nDimethylthiazol-2-y1]-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to an insoluble \npurple formazan dye (M2128-Sigma Chemicals, Perth, Australia).17 The absorbance \nof the blue formazan product was measured on a plate reader (Benchmark, Bio-Rad \nLaboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) at 550nm and the results were expressed as mM of \nformazan\/g wet weight.  A reduction in the MTT values would represent decreased \ntissue viability. \n 8\n \nAssessment of apoptosis and necrosis \nFirst, the muscles were incubated for 10 minutes on ice with 5\u00b5M propidium iodide \n(PI) in 0.1M tri-sodium citrate and 20mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH7.4 \nto identify the necrotic nuclei. Sections were then fixed twice, initially for 30 minutes \nwith 4% paraformaldehyde in 30% sucrose and then with 20mM PBS overnight on \nice and at pH7.4. Following this, serial sections of 10 \u00b5m were cut with a Bright \ncryomicrotome (model OTF) at \u201325OC in tissue embedding matrix (Tissue Tek\u00ae \nOCT compound). The cryopreserved tissue sections were washed with 20mM PBS at \npH 7.4 for 2 minutes, then permeabilised in 0.02mg\/ml proteinase-K for 10 minutes at \n37\u00baC, and pre-sensitised for 1 minute in a microwave oven at 800 watts in 0.1% \nTriton X-100 and 0.1M sodium citrate at pH 6.0. To assess apoptosis, the terminal \ndeoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was used to incorporate fluorescein (FITC) \nlabelled dUTP oligonucleotides to DNA strand breaks at the 3\u2019-OH termini in a \ntemplate dependent manner (TUNEL technique) using a commercially available kit \n(Roche:1684795, Basel, Switzerland). Using this labelling procedure sequence the \nnuclei can either be stained with PI or TUNEL but not both.  An 8\u03bcm section of the \nmirror specimens opened up the cell membrane of all the cells to enable all the nuclei \nto be stained.  Prior to the TUNEL labelling of muscles, positive controls were treated \nwith DNase-I and negative controls were obtained by adding the label solution of the \nkit without the enzyme solution.  The FITC fluorescence emission (range 600-630nm) \nwas measured using argon-ion fluorescence excitation at 488nm and detected by laser \nconfocal epifluorescence microscopy with a x10 oil immersion objective. The PI \nlabelled nuclei was excited with helium-neon laser light at 543nm and fluorescence \nwas detected using an emission range of 680-730nm in order to abolish fluorescence \n\u2018bleed-through\u2019 from FITC labelled nuclei. Analysis was done using NIH Image \nsoftware (Scion Corp, Frederick, Maryland, USA) with the Cavalieri-3 macro (G. \nMacDonald, University of Washington), that allows to place point-counting templates \n 9\nover an image to perform stereological estimates. Fluorescent signals with areas \ngreater than 16\u00b5m2 were counted to ensure that only nuclei are taken into account and \nto avoid the inclusion of artefact. Absolute numbers of green fluorescent apoptotic \n(A) and necrotic (N) red fluorescent nuclei in any given image field were determined \nby dividing by the total number of PI labelled nuclei (M) in the next serial or mirror \nsection. The absolute percentage of apoptotic cells was given by A\/M *100% and the \npercentage of necrotic cells by N\/M *100%.  The automatic counting was combined \nwith regular manual inspection to ascertain that artefacts were not represented in the \ndata. \n \nMeasurement of caspase activity  \nThe muscle sections stored at \u2013800C until analyses were thawed in 400\u00b5l of cell lysis \nbuffer (in mM): Hepes , 10% sucrose, 0.1% Chaps and DTT (10), in the presence of a \ncocktail of enzyme inhibitors (P2850-Sigma Chemicals, Perth, Australia) at a pH of \n7.0 to release the intracellular contents. The muscle was diced finely and then \nhomogenised (Ultra-Turrax homogeniser: Janke and Kunkel GmbH, Staufen, \nGermany) at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute on ice. This was followed by centrifugation \n(PK121R-ALC International) at 14,000 rpm for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the protein \nconcentration of the soluble supernatant (cell lysate) was measured using a detergent \ncompatible Bio-Rad assay (23225-Pierce, Cheshire, UK). Aliquots of cell lysate were \nthen tested for caspase activity by the addition of a caspase-specific peptide or \nsubstrate, DEVD that is conjugated to the chromophore (fluorescent reporter \nmolecule) 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (AFC). The cleavage of the peptide \nDEVD from DEVD.AFC (final concentration 20\u00b5M; Alexis Chemicals, San Diego, \nCA, USA) releases AFC that when excited by light at 400nm emits fluorescence at \n505nm. The level of caspase activity in the cell lysate was detected by fluorescence \nsignal obtained with a fluorometer (Fluostar P401, BMG software, Longmont, CO, \n 10\nUSA). The amount of caspase-3 like activity was measured by using the effector \ncaspase inhibitor z-DEVD.fmk at a final concentration of 10\u00b5M in the well of the \nreader plate and by subtracting the fluorescence obtained by the total fluorescence \nmeasured in the absence of the inhibitor. The results were expressed as arbitrary units \nfluorescence of activity\/g wet weight.  \n \nChemicals \n The caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVAD.fmk (R&D Systems-FMK003) was used at \ndifferent concentrations (0, 0.02, 0.2, and 2\u00b5M). The caspase-3 inhibitor z-\nDEVD.fmk (FMK004) was used at the concentration of 70nM which was shown to be \nthe optimal dose by previous experiments in our laboratory.18  The PARP inhibitor PJ-\n34 (Alexis Biochemical L10210) was also used at different concentrations (0, 0.07, \n0.7, and 7.0\u00b5M). \n \nStatistical analysis \nAll results were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of mean. To compare the overall \nstatistical significance among ND, NIDDM and IDDM groups, the non-parametric \nanalysis of variance (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis H) technique was used. The \ncomparisons between the independent groups are based on non-parametric Mann-\nWhitney test. A p value of <0.05 was taken to be statistically significant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 11\nRESULTS \nStudy 1: Degree of apoptosis and necrosis in the non-ischemic fresh \ndiabetic myocardium \n(i) Apoptosis and necrosis \nFigure 1 shows that in the non-ischemic fresh myocardium, cell death was \nsignificantly higher in the NIDDM and IDDM groups than in the non-diabetic group. \nThus, whereas apoptosis was 15.0\u00b12.8 % and 12.5\u00b12.9% in the NIDDM and IDDM \ngroups, respectively, values were 3.7\u00b1 0.8 % (p<0.05) in the non-diabetic group. \nSimilarly, the mean values for necrosis were 10.7\u00b12.9 % in the NIDDM and \n10.3\u00b12.0% in IDDM  groups but only 5.0\u00b1 1.1 % in the non-diabetic group (p<0.05). \nFigure E1 shows representative images for apoptosis and necrosis in fresh \nmyocardium from the three study groups.  It should be noted that, although some of \nthe observed cell death in the atrial muscles could be attributed to the trauma of \ntissues induced by the procurement procedure, all muscles were treated identically \nand therefore the differences seen between the diabetic and non-diabetic groups are \nreal. \n \n(ii) Caspase activity \nAs shown in Figure 2, the activity of initiator caspases in fresh non-ischemic muscles \nwas similar in non-diabetics and in NIDDM and IDDM groups. However, the activity \nof effector caspases was significantly increased in the NIDDM and IDDM groups as \ncompared to the non-diabetic group. \n \n \n \n \n \n 12\nStudy 2: Effect of ischemia\/reoxygenation in the diabetic \nmyocardium  \n(i) Apoptosis and necrosis \nFigures 3a and 3b show that apoptosis and necrosis were increased in time-matched \naerobically incubated muscles for 210 minutes of the NIDDM and IDDM as \ncompared to the values in the non-diabetic group, which confirms the results seen \nabove in fresh (not incubated) tissue.  The similar degree of apoptosis and necrosis \nseen in fresh and aerobically-incubated muscles rules out a significant effect of the \ntissue culture conditions on these two end-points.  The figures also show that SI\/R \ncaused a significant increase of the two forms of cell death in the non-diabetic group \nand that values were even greater in the NIDDM and IDDM groups. Figure E2 shows \nrepresentative images for apoptosis and necrosis following ischemia\/reoxygenation \nfor the three study groups. It is worth to note that the degree of apoptosis and necrosis \nin aerobically incubated and ischemic\/reoxygenated muscles was similar in the two \ntypes of diabetes and because of this no separation between insulin-dependant and \ninsulin-independent patients was made in study 3 (see below). \n \n(ii) CK release \nTable E1 demonstrates that the mean CK release values during the first two hours of \nreoxygenation and after 90 minutes of ischemia were similarly increased in the non-\ndiabetic and diabetic groups. \n \n(iii) MTT reduction \nTable E2 shows that SI\/R resulted in a significant decrease in MTT reduction in the \nnon-diabetic and diabetic groups that, in contrast with the above results on apoptosis \nand necrosis, it was of similar degree in all the three groups.  \n \n 13\n(iv) Caspase Activity \nFigure 2 shows that SI\/R induced a significant increase in initiator caspase activity in \natrial muscles from the three group of patients when compared to fresh tissue. \nHowever, SI\/R did not significantly influence the activity of the effector caspases in \nthe muscles from non-diabetics but this was greatly elevated in the NIDDM and \nIDDM groups. \n  \nStudy 3: The role of caspases and PARP in cell death in the diabetic \nmyocardium. \n(i) Apoptosis and necrosis \nFigures 4a and 4b show that in the presence of the caspase-3 inhibitor z.DEVD.fmk \nthe apoptosis caused by SI\/R was almost completely abolished in the non-diabetic \ngroup but necrosis was unaffected. In contrast, in the muscles from diabetics caspase-\n3 inhibition reduced apoptosis by only 50% and again did not affect necrosis.  \n \nTable E3 shows that the percentage of apoptosis and necrosis in atrial tissue subjected \nto SI\/R from non-diabetic and diabetic patients was not affected by the presence of \nvarious concentrations of the caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVAD.fmk.  \n \nFigures 5a and 5b show that the percentage of apoptosis and necrosis in atrial tissue \nsubjected to SI\/R was similarly reduced in non-diabetic and diabetic groups in a dose- \ndependent manner by the PARP inhibitor PJ-34. Significant reduction was obtained at \n0.7\u00b5M concentration for apoptosis and at 7\u00b5M for necrosis.  \n \n(ii) CK release \nTable E4 shows that the release of CK following SI\/R was not significantly affected \nby the caspase-3 and caspase-2 inhibitors z.DEVD.fmk and z.VDVAD.fmk. By \n 14\ncontrast, PARP inhibition resulted in a significant reduction in CK release. These \nresults taken together may suggest that CK release is a reflection of necrosis rather \nthan apoptosis.  \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe present studies have demonstrated that cell death by apoptosis and necrosis is \ngreater in the human fresh, non-ischemic myocardium of diabetics than of non-\ndiabetics, which is associated to an increase in the expression of effector caspases. \nThey have also shown that the diabetic myocardium is more susceptible to \nischemia\/reoxygenation injury than the non-diabetic tissue, an effect that is mediated, \nat least in part, by caspase-3 and PARP activation. The importance of these findings \nfor the understanding of the pathophysiology of ischemia\/reoxygenation injury in the \ndiabetic myocardium and their clinical implications are discussed below. \n \nCell death in the fresh, non-ischemic diabetic myocardium  \nCell death by apoptosis and necrosis is a feature of end-stage heart failure19 but also \noccurs in the healthy myocardium.20 Here we have demonstrated that the occurrence \nof apoptosis and necrosis in human atrial tissue is greater in patients with diabetes \nthan without diabetes a finding that is supported by those of Frustaci et al21 in \nventricular biopsies. Because myocytes rarely proliferate in adult cardiac muscles, the \nincrease loss of cardiac muscles in the diabetic myocardium may lead to a reduction \nof cardiac mass and to elevated interstitial and per vascular fibrosis causing a decrease \nin myocardial performance and ventricular dilatation, a sequence of events that may \nbe responsible for the increasing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in diabetic \npatients.22  \n \n 15\nA possible explanation for the increase in cell death in diabetes may be a greater \noxidative stress observed with this condition23 which in turn may be responsible for \nthe activation of effector caspases seen in our studies. There is experimental evidence \nthat caspases are activated in diabetes11 and also that caspases are activated by \noxidative stress in non-diabetics20 and in diabetics.24 Indeed high glucose causes \noxidative stress that results in caspase-3 activation in  human endothelial cells via \nSAPK\/JNK activation.25 Activating of effector caspases in diabetes can also be \ninduced by the abnormal accumulation of beta hydroxyl fatty acid, as seen in mice,  \nwhich alters the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, and causes the release \nof cytochrome c and the activation of  the downstream caspases.26 Our findings that \neffector caspases are activated in the fresh, non-ischemic human atrial myocardium \nsuggests a central role of these proteins in the increase in apoptosis seen in the heart \nof patients with diabetes, but it is clear that investigation is required to elucidate the \nprecise molecular mechanism involved. \n \nSusceptibility of the diabetic myocardium to ischemia\/reoxygenation  \ninjury  \nThe present studies have also shown that the diabetic myocardium is more susceptible \nto ischemia\/reoxygenation injury than the non-diabetic myocardium when the \npropidium iodide and TUNEL technique read-out for apoptosis and necrosis are used. \nThese results in the human myocardium are supported by experimental animal studies \nin rats27 and dogs28 showing that diabetes makes the heart more susceptible to \nischemia\/reoxygenation injury. However, other experimental studies29 have reported \nthat the diabetic myocardium is in fact more tolerant to injury than the non-diabetic \ntissue. The reason for these divergent results is not clear but it is possible that the \nduration and the severity of the diabetic state and the differences in the experimental \npreparations used may play a role.10 Another potential explanation could be a lack of \n 16\ncorrespondence between different end-points as shown by our results on CK release \nand MTT reduction. \n \nThe observation that the activity of the effector caspases is more elevated in the \ndiabetic than in the non-diabetic myocardium when subjected to an ischemic insult \nmay suggest that this class of enzymes are responsible for the greater occurrence of \napoptosis in diabetes. However, caspase-3 inhibition reduced apoptosis in the diabetic \nto a lesser extent than in the non-diabetic myocardium and caspase-2 inhibition, an \nenzyme that shares sequence homology with initiator caspases  like caspase-9 and -130 \nbut with cleavage specificity closer to the effector caspases caspase-3 and -7,31 did not \neffect apoptosis in either of the two groups, all suggesting that the increase of \nmyocardial apoptosis in diabetes is not dependent on the greater activation of the \neffector caspases alone. Our finding that the induction of apoptosis by \nischemia\/reoxygenation in the human non-diabetic myocardium is caspase-3 \ndependent, is supported by in vivo animal experimental studies;11 however, the \nfinding that caspase-3 inhibition only partially reduced apoptosis in the diabetic \nmyocardium suggests that a caspase-independent pathway causing apoptosis also \nexist in the diabetic myocardium.  \n \nIn contrast with the results on inhibition of caspases-3 activity, the inhibition of PARP \nsimilarly reduced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in both the diabetic and the \nnon-diabetic ischemic myocardium with almost complete abolition at the highest \nconcentration of the inhibitor PJ-34 used (7\u00b5M).  The above suggests that both \ncaspase-dependent and \u2013independent pathways of apoptosis converge in activation of \nPARP. It is possible that the reported increase activation of PARP seen in the diabetic \nrat myocardium32 is responsible for the greater susceptibility of this tissue to \napoptosis. However, the role of PARP in ischemic injury has been disputed and \nwhereas in vitro33 and in vivo13 studies have demonstrated a limitation in cellular \n 17\ninjury by PARP inhibition, other investigators have suggested that PARP activation is \nnot indispensable for apoptosis.34\n \nClinical implications and limitations of the study \nThe present studies have identified molecular mechanisms by which the diabetic \nmyocardium is more susceptible to ischemic injury than the non-diabetic tissue. These \nfindings may be of clinical relevance since they provide an explanation for the \nincreased cardiac-related morbidity and mortality seen in diabetic patients during \nheart surgery and because ischemic injury can be reduced by pharmacological \nmanipulation of the pathways involved. However, it should be clarified that our \nstudies were performed in vitro using atrial myocardium and that any extrapolation to \nthe clinical situation should be done with caution.  An additional limitation of these \nstudies is that because of methodological constraints, the cell type of each nucleus \nundergoing death could not be determined.  Therefore, the observed cell death could \nbe due to the demise of any cell type within the myocardium including the \ncardiomyocyte. \n \nAcknowledgements: \nThis work was partially supported by Diabetes UK (BDA:RD01:0002329) and \nLeicester Take Heart.
