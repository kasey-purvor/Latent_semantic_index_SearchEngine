A landowner near Perth, while tending his \ngarden, unearthed a partly-buried carved stone pillar. This pillar, which appears to \nhave been the base of a sundial or similar garden ornament, bore the inscription \n\u201cEarthquake heard here, January 19, 1840\u201d. The date was unfamiliar; existing \ncompilations of British earthquakes listed no event on this date. Further investigation \nrevealed that there was indeed an earthquake on this day, with magnitude of around \n3.2 ML, which had been missed by previous compilers. The Perthshire Advertiser (30 \nJanuary 1840 p3) carried a report from an anonymous correspondent in the village of \nStanley, north of Perth, that the earthquake was heard (but not felt) there, and \nMusson (1993a) conjectures that the pillar was originally located in the garden of \nStanley House, and looted from there after the house was destroyed by fire in 1887. \nThis anecdote can be viewed as symbolic of the story of British earthquakes. On the \none hand they are generally small in world terms, as one expects in a purely \nintraplate environment. On the other, they are remarkably well documented. In what \nother country might one find a carved stone monument to an earthquake that was \nonly 3.2 ML (local magnitude), and was only heard and not felt by the person who \ncommissioned the memorial? \nThis high level of documentation partly reflects the rarity of occurrence of British \nearthquakes. When one does occur, it is a newsworthy event, and people are \ninterested to record that they observed it, if only slightly. Thus it is not unusual, even \n 2\nin the historical record, to find observations of earthquakes at intensity levels as low \nas 2 EMS (European Macroseismic Scale), whereas in countries with a much higher \nlevel of seismic activity, weak earthquake shaking is sufficiently common that people \ndo not bother to note it. \nThis has advantages in terms of the degree to which one can accurately determine \nearthquake parameters for historical events. There are two main approaches to \nestimating magnitude for pre-instrumental earthquakes from macroseismic data. The \nfirst is to relate the maximum intensity to magnitude; the second is based on the total \nfelt area. If reports survive from only the damaged localities, the seismologist is \nlargely restricted to using maximum intensity; however, this is a bad analogue for \nmagnitude because it is heavily influenced by focal depth and local soil conditions. In \ncontrast, total felt area is a very robust parameter which correlates strongly with \nmagnitude and is unaffected by focal depth (Musson 1996a). Furthermore, with \nenough isoseismals, it is possible to estimate focal depth itself to some accuracy \nusing the method first proposed by K\u00f6vesligethy (1906). Because the typical larger \nBritish earthquake, at least from the 18th century onwards, tends to be well-\ndocumented from the epicentre out to the fringes of observation, it is possible to \nconstruct a lengthy catalogue of British earthquakes with reliable parameters even for \nearthquakes in the pre-instrumental period (Musson 1994). \nAn exceptional case was the earthquake of 28 April 2007, in which a relative modest \nearthquake (4.3 ML) occurred at shallow depth close to the town of Folkestone, \ncausing considerable damage concentrated in one area of the town, interruption of \nelectricity supplies and disruption to travel. This was the first occasion in modern \nBritish experience of emergency procedures needing to be instated by local \ngovernment as a result of a British earthquake. Since this paper was drafted in \nJanuary 2006, the Folkestone earthquake is not included in any of the analysis or \nfigures that follow. \nIn this paper, the seismicity of the UK will be discussed under three headings: firstly, \nthe evolution of data sources and how this affects the resolution of UK seismicity \nover time. Secondly, the general and regional characteristics of British seismicity. \nLastly, some account will be given of attempts to explain the distribution of \nearthquakes in the British Isles in relation to geology and neotectonics; and to active \nfaulting. A further aspect, the history of the study of British earthquakes, has already \nbeen dealt with in depth in Musson (2004a). \nBritish seismicity in relation to data sources \nAn understanding of the historical data from which our knowledge of British \nearthquakes is derived is important, in order to appreciate the limits on the \nearthquake catalogue. As discussed above, the relative rarity of earthquakes in the \nUK has paradoxically encouraged their documentation; but one must also consider \nthe fact that the intellectually active culture of the inhabitants of the British Isles, and \nhigh literacy levels, has contributed considerably. Amongst other points of note can \nbe cited: (i) the fact that documentation of local earthquakes was deliberately \npursued as a scientific endeavour as early as the 1660s, with the founding of the \nRoyal Society (Musson 2004a); (ii) that regional newspapers were published on a \nregular basis from around 1700 onwards (Musson 1986); (iii) variations in language \nand literacy sometimes impact directly on reporting patterns; for instance, the \ndistribution of reports of the large Scottish earthquake of 8 November 1608 reflects \nthe linguistic divide at that time between English-speaking (literate) and Gaelic-\nspeaking (non-literate) areas (Musson 1989a). \n 3\nEarly records \nResearch into historical seismicity has to take into account the historical and \nintellectual environment of the times, and this extends to changes in language. In \nparticular, the very word \u201cearthquake\u201d had a much wider usage in the past than is \nnow the case. In particular, it was widely used to refer to landslips, landslides, cavern \ncollapses, bogbursts and anything similar. One 18th century writer (Anon 1750) lists \nno less than nine kinds of earthquake, including one which turns out to be volcanic \nash fall. Many 18th century writers on earthquakes (one might mention Burton 1734, \n1737 as an example) give much weight to the Herefordshire event of 17 February \n1571 as one of the \u201cgreatest\u201d of English earthquakes \u2013 this was a landslip on the \neastern side of Marcle Hill, the outlines of which can still be seen today. Even as late \nas the early 19th century, a major block slide at Lyme (Dorset) on 23 December 1839 \nwas reported as being an \u201cearthquake\u201d. \nThus one must be wary of reports in monastic chronicles which simply state, \u201cThis \nyear there was an earthquake\u201d. Even if the same report appears in several \nchronicles, one cannot be sure what type of event is actually being referred to. One \nrequires some extra clue; thus, \u201cThis year there was an earthquake throughout \nEngland\u201d is clearly a real earthquake and not a landslip. \nAs a result, there is some doubt as to what is the earliest British earthquake on \nrecord. One can discount the many spurious pre-millenial earthquakes that originate \nin the work of Short (1749), including the notorious 811 St Andrews earthquake \n(which appears in the NOAA online earthquake database). These have long been \nrecognised as fakes (Musson 2005a). The earliest contender is an entry in the \nAnnals of Ulster (Bal\u00e9 and Purcell 2003 is the most recent edition) for 601 \u2013 \u201cAn \nearthquake in Bairche.\u201d Bairche (or Ui Bairrche) was a kingdom in the south-east of \nwhat is now County Laois. The same source mentions an earthquake in Britain in \n664 without details. A report in the Annals of Clonmacnoise (Murphy 1896) states \nthat in 680 there was \u201can extreme great wind and earthquake in Ireland\u201d.  \nThere is no reason to suppose that any of these were definitely earthquakes; the \nconjunction with a storm in 680 makes it even more likely that that one was \nsomething else. More promising is the event in 684 (or 685 in some sources) which is \nvariously described as occurring in Ireland, the Isle of Man, and Britain. This could be \ntaken as a large earthquake with epicentre in the Irish Sea, but careful textual \nanalysis by Dumville (1984) shows that all texts are derived from a lost original \ndealing with the Isle of Man, and that the references to other places are errors \nintroduced by copyists. So this event could equally well be a rockfall somewhere in \nthe Isle of Man. In 707 the Annals of Ulster record \u201cTwo earthquakes in the same \nweek in the month of December in the northern part of Ireland\u201d. This does sound as if \nit might be more likely to refer to a real earthquake. The same source also records \nevents in October 721 (no place specified), 8 February 730 (no place specified) and \n12 April 740 (Islay), any of which may or may not be genuine earthquakes.  \nThe earliest English source is Florence of Worcester (Stevenson 1853-6) who \nrecords in 974 a tremendous earthquake all over England, and this is therefore the \nfirst event which is unquestionably a true earthquake. According to Goutoulas (1653) \nthis earthquake threw down houses and killed people; whether Goutoulas was citing \na source now lost or made this detail up one cannot tell. \nFor the next three centuries, English and Welsh chronicles become the most \nimportant source of information on British earthquakes. Undoubtedly Scottish \nchronicles were also compiled, but few survived the violence of the Reformation \n(Maxwell 1912). The principal surviving Scottish chronicle is that compiled at \nHolyrood (Stevenson 1853-6) which mentions only two British earthquakes (both \nEnglish) and without details. \n 4\nIn general, entries in chronicles are greatly lacking in detail. Often only the date is \nmentioned. Thus only very few events can be located with any certainty. One \ntechnique that has been proposed is to use simple appearances of a notice about an \nearthquake in a monastic chronicle as necessarily indicating that the earthquake was \nfelt in that monastery (Melville 1983). This allows one to build up maps that appear to \nbe felt-area maps but which are in fact report-area maps. Confusing the two is highly \ndangerous; Houtgast (1992) relocates a North Italian earthquake to Central Europe \nby this means, on the basis of a map in Guidoboni (1983) which that author expressly \nnotes is not a felt-area map. The problem is discussed at length by Musson (1998a) \nin which it is concluded that the assumption that a bare report in a monastic chronicle \nimplies that the earthquake was felt at that locality cannot be sustained. In Musson \n(2004b) comparison is made between monastic reporting of earthquakes and \nreporting of storms, which demonstrates further that the presence or absence of \nmention of an earthquake in a particular chronicle is not a reliable indication that the \nevent was or was not felt at the monastery in question. \nAn interesting case is the earthquake of 20 February 1247, almost certainly one of \nthe largest earthquakes to originate in Britain. This has previously been assumed to \nhave had an epicentre near Pembroke (e.g. Principia 1982) largely because it \ncaused damage to St David's cathedral. As Woo (1991) argues, damage to single \nanomalous structures is a highly unreliable way of pinpointing the epicentre of an \nearthquake (one thinks of the concentration of media reporting on the 1997 damage \nto the basilica at Assissi, which was in fact on the edge of the felt area of the Umbria-\nMarche earthquake of that year). It is quite credible that the 1247 earthquake could \nhave been a Caernarvon-area event similar to those of 1852 and 1984. On the other \nhand, it is equally possible that it really was a Pembroke event, a larger version of the \n18 August 1892 earthquake. There is simply no way of resolving the issue. Stretching \nthe scanty data further than they will go is not a solution. Similar cases are presented \nby the earthquakes of 15 April 1185 and 11 September 1275, which damaged \nLincoln cathedral and St Michael\u2019s Glastonbury respectively. It would be most unsafe \nto propose epicentral locations for either event based purely on damage to single, \nrather anomalous, structures; the one a cathedral in unknown condition at the time of \nthe event; the other a church perched on the top of a steep hill (Glastonbury Tor). \nLate and post-medieval periods \nAfter the 13th century, reporting of earthquakes declines, as the old style of \ncompendious annal was gradually replaced by a more consciously historiographical \nstyle of writing, with a greater political focus and less interest in natural phenomena. \nIn the 15th century, there is almost a total lack of recorded earthquakes for Britain; it \nis unlikely that it was a seismically quieter century than any other; rather, it is a \nreflection of the type of historical sources that were compiled at the time, and which \nhave survived to the present day. However, from the mid 16th century onwards, the \nincrease in literacy and spread of printing greatly encouraged the recording of \nearthquakes. The damaging earthquake of 6 April 1580 (Dover Straits), which killed \ntwo children in London, sparked a flurry of printed pamphlets describing the event; \nsome of these are now lost, but several survive and are useful sources on the event \n(Ockenden 1936, Neilson et al 1984). One of these contains the first ever British \nearthquake catalogue (Fleming 1580). \nHowever, throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, the preservation of reports on \nearthquakes is largely a matter of chance. Sources are often miscellaneous \ndocuments: letters, notes on flyleaves, pamphlets, memoranda, etc, which cannot be \nrelied on to survive or become known. An earthquake felt in Antrim around the end of \nthe 16th century is known only because Sir Thomas Molyneaux remembered hearing \nan old lady mention that when she was young she heard it recalled that years before \n 5\nshe was born, Sir Hugh Clotworthy felt an earthquake in his house. Molyneaux put \nthis recollection in a letter to his brother William in 1690; the letter survived and was \npublished in 1841 (Wilde 1841); and only thus do we know of the earthquake. (It may \nhave been a distant observation of the large Scottish earthquake of 23 July 1597). \nOn the other hand, no account has survived of the moderately large Scottish Borders \nearthquake of June 1668. That this earthquake happened at all can be construed \nfrom two later documents, but no contemporary record of it has been traced. This \nputs considerable limits on what one may deduce about the completeness of the \nhistorical record up into the late 17th century. \nMacroseismic data from newspapers \nAt the beginning of the 18th century the situation changes significantly with the \ncoming of the newspaper as a feature of British life. The use of newspaper data in \nhistorical earthquake studies is quite different from the use of manuscript data, for \none simple reason. It is not the job of occasional writers to record every event that \nhappens in a place, so whether they do or not is down to chance factors. In the case \nof newspapers, however, it is their job to record such day to day occurrences, and \ntherefore, within certain limits, one has reason to expect to find data preserved. Thus, \nif an earthquake which was felt in Manchester is not reported as having been felt in \nLeeds by a newspaper published in Leeds, the absence of data does suggest that \nthe effects of the earthquake in Leeds (if any) were limited and not news-worthy, a \nconclusion that cannot be so easily drawn with manuscript sources. Earthquakes are \nnews, and newspapers make it their business to report news. This makes them a \nprolific and very useful source of data, so long as one bears in mind the limitations of \nnewspapers as sources. \nThe biggest limitation is a historical one. Although printed newspapers in Britain are \namongst the earliest in the world, they started on a limited basis in the more \neconomically important towns and cities, and only gradually spread to the whole \ncountry. Also, the survival of complete runs of some early newspapers is not as good \nas one would like.  Existing collections of some titles, particularly before the 1820s is \nfragmentary. In such cases, a paragraph describing an earthquake may sometimes \nsurvive through having been copied by one newspaper for which a good run of \ncopies survives, from another newspaper now lost. \nEarly newspapers were quite unlike those that are published today. The typical 18th \ncentury newspaper consisted of four pages; most of the first and last pages were \ngiven over to advertisements, while the second page and part of the third would carry \nnational and foreign news as received from London. Then one or two columns on \npage three would contain information about local occurrences, not as separate news \nitems, but as a succession of short paragraphs. This would include any accounts of \nan earthquake being felt in the town of publication or in the vicinity, or the area \nserved by the newspaper, or sometimes further afield. These accounts were \nsometimes simply copied from other newspapers, often without attribution. This \nmeans that a newspaper published on Friday 20 May, stating that \"Last Tuesday an \nearthquake was felt in X\", may be simply copying an item published in another paper \non Friday 13 May - the date of the earthquake would therefore be 10 May not 17 \nMay. This sort of confusion has often resulted in duplications in earlier earthquake \ncatalogues. \nDuring the early 19th century, and especially after 1853 when taxes on newspapers \nwere eased, the typical local newspaper expanded in size, and the amount of \ninformation carried increased substantially. A typical local paper of the 1870s would \nhave a page of national and foreign news extracted from the news agencies, a leader \ncolumn which would be followed by local news for the town of publication, more local \n 6\nnews for the surrounding area arranged by town or village, and then various features \nsuch as farming news, sports, fiction, household and so on, in addition to the \nadvertisements which would completely cover at the very least the front page. In \nsuch cases, the principal parts of the paper for scrutiny for earthquake data are the \nlocal news items, which present first-hand accounts of the local effects of the \nearthquake. Items appearing via the news agencies rather than the paper's own staff \nare second-hand and tend to be less reliable. Useful information can sometimes \nappear in less expected places, for example, a diary column.  \nAt this period, pages were large, type faces were small, headlines were small or non-\nexistent, and pictures were generally absent. As a result, the sheer number of words \nin a single issue of a newspaper could be quite large. (In the absence of other forms \nof entertainment, having a lengthy newspaper to read was appreciated by many \nfamilies.) Correspondingly, the amount of information printed on an earthquake when \nit occurred could be significant. Correspondents in the different villages would send in \ntheir accounts, and it is possible to compile reasonably full accounts of the \nmacroseismic fields of the larger earthquakes from such reports. \nIn the course of the 20th century, the British local newspaper went into something of a \ndecline. Many ceased to publish or were merged into other titles, and those that \nremained changed their style considerably. The modern style is characterised by far \nless text; space is bulked out by large headlines and pictures, as well as larger type \nsizes. The average report of a local earthquake in a modern newspaper will have a \nvery large headline and one or more large pictures of such subjects as a local person \nwho felt it, a seismologist, or a map of the places affected. The text itself will be short, \nwith an interview with a seismologist forming the bulk, and perhaps one or two very \nshort personal experiences, usually devoid of the sort of data from which one could \nassign intensity. \nAccordingly, the quantity and quality of information about the effects of local \nearthquakes derived from newspapers declines in the second half of the 20th century. \nIt is fortunate that after 1974 such data are preserved through regular macroseismic \nsurveys of earthquakes conducted by BGS. The use and limitations of newspaper \ndata in macroseismic studies is discussed in more detail by Musson (1986). \nEarly instrumental records of British earthquakes \nThe introduction of instrumental recording of earthquakes goes back to around \n1900, and to some extent, even earlier. Primitive instruments built on the \nsimple pendulum principle existed in Italy as early as the 18th century. The first \ninverted pendulum instrument was built in Scotland in 1840 (Forbes 1844). \nThese early instruments had no way of measuring the time at which an event \noccurred, and the first clock-regulated instrument was that of Palmieri in Italy in \nthe 1850s.  \nSome British earthquakes of the 19th century left instrumental traces on other \ndevices also; the 1871 earthquake in the North Penninnes is supposed to have \nleft a record on a magnetogram from Stonyhurst, though inspection of the \nrecord today does not reveal this. The 1884 Colchester earthquake was \ncertainly recorded quite clearly on a magnetogram at Richmond. \nThe important development made by John Milne and his colleagues in Japan in \nthe 1880s was the introduction of an instrument of known mechanical \nproperties such that the movement of the ground could be calculated \naccurately from the instrumental trace. It was this that opened the door to \nuseful instrumental studies in seismology. Instruments of the Milne type were \ndeployed in Britain in the 1890s. \n 7\nThe first British earthquake to be recorded instrumentally was the Derby \nearthquake of 24 March 1903, which was detected on a Milne instrument at \nBidston, an Omori at Birmingham run by Charles Davison, and the Wiechert \ninstrument at G\u00f6ttingen. \nThe main problem with early instrumental records of British earthquakes is that \nthe instruments in use in the earlier part of the 20th century were designed \nprimarily for the study of large earthquakes at teleseismic distances. They were \nvery insensitive to high-frequency waves from small earthquakes at close \ndistances. As a result, the traces, where they exist at all, are frequently so \nsmall as to be very difficult to read.  \nSince, for most historical British earthquakes, so few instrumental records exist, \nthere is no possibility of using instrumental data to locate the epicentre or \ndepth, which is better done from macroseismic data. However, measurements \nof the magnitude are possible, subject to uncertainties. The source of these \nuncertainties is threefold. Firstly, there is the difficulty of reading the maximum \namplitude in the first place from such records. However, because magnitude \nscales with the logarithm of the amplitude, even an error as large as a factor of \ntwo in reading the amplitude will only change the magnitude value by 0.3. \nSecondly, the derivation of the ground motion amplitude from the seismogram \ntrace amplitude may be uncertain if there is uncertainty about the transfer \nfunction of the instrument in question, or if the instrument was badly calibrated. \nThirdly, if there is uncertainty in the position of the epicentre, there will be a \nproblem in correctly estimating the epicentral distance; this is especially \nimportant if the amount of locational uncertainty is a significant fraction of the \ndistance to the instrument (Neilson and Burton 1984). \nOne can add that, since final instrumental magnitudes are usually the mean of \nseveral station magnitudes, if there are only a few recordings this increases the \noverall uncertainty of the final value, since individual station magnitudes may \nbe significantly affected by the radiation pattern of the earthquake. \nTherefore, from 1900 to 1970, although instrumental recordings of British \nearthquakes are a very useful source, frequently one finds that one has to rely \non macroseismic data still as providing the most accurate parameters. \nThe development of early instrumental monitoring has been traced in detail by Lovell \nand Henni (1999), in a report that lists information for all known stations in the British \nIsles that were operative before 1970. The total number of such stations is 51, but \nthis includes a number that were run on an amateur basis, sometimes only for a very \nshort period. For many stations, although it is known when they operated and which \ninstruments were used, the seismograms have long been lost and even bulletins may \nnot survive. The principal surviving collections of historical seismograms (held in \nBGS archives) are those from Aberdeen, Paisley, Edinburgh, Eskdalemuir, Durham, \nBidston and Kew. It is very regrettable that the records from some important stations, \nsuch as Stonyhurst and Oxford, have long since vanished. (One seismogram alone \nsurvives from Oxford, and only because it was borrowed and never returned.) \nExtensive use of surviving records, including bulletins where these are available, was \nmade by Neilson and Burton (1984, 1985, 1988) in determining magnitudes for \nearthquakes between 1900 and 1970. The earliest British earthquake for which a \nseismogram exists is the 1903 Derby earthquake. \nModern instrumental data \nThe very start of specific UK-oriented earthquake monitoring using modern \nseismometers capable of detecting small-magnitude earthquakes was in 1967. At \n 8\nthis date work began on LOWNET, a network of short period vertical component \nseismometers (Willmore Mk 2) deployed at seven outstations in Central Scotland and \na central three-component set in Edinburgh (Crampin et al 1970). This network was \nformally declared open in January 1969; it was operated by the then Institute of \nGeological Sciences, now the British Geological Survey (BGS). This network proved \nvery capable of detecting small earthquakes in Central Scotland (this was a period \nwhen a large number of mining induced earthquakes were observed in the \nMidlothian, Fife and Clackmannanshire coalfields) but its detection capacity for \nevents in England and Wales was limited. Annual catalogues from LOWNET up to \n1978 are given by Burton and Neilson (1980). \nIn response to a variety of factors, the network gradually expanded after its original \nfoundation. The first expansion south came in 1976 when the Department of the \nEnvironment sponsored new stations near Stoke-on-Trent, Leeds, Leicester and \nHereford. The occurrence of significant felt earthquakes in the Kintail area in 1974-5 \nresulted in extra stations also being deployed in the Kyle of Lochalsh area. Further \nadditions to the network were made in an ad hoc manner in response to particular \ndemands \u2013 stations in Shetland, north-east Scotland and East Anglia in connection \nwith hydrocarbon developments in the North Sea; a dense local network in Cornwall \nand Devon to monitor the Hot Dry Rock geothermal project (Browitt 1991). \nIn 1989 the network was put on a new footing with the establishment of a Customer \nGroup to sponsor the BGS Seismic Monitoring and Information Service. This \nCustomer Group is led by what was then the Department of the Environment, now \nthe Office of the Deputy Prime Minster, and includes members from the Government, \nNuclear, Hydrocarbon and Water sectors amongst others. Under this project, the \nnetwork was gradually expanded, in order to provide coverage over the whole \ncountry. This development, which combined specific local objectives with a \nrecognition of the need to provide uniform coverage of the country, is detailed in a \nseries of annual reports, of which the most recent at time of writing is Baptie (2005). \nFigure 1 shows the station distribution at five stages of development: 1970, 1980, \n1985, 1993 and 2005. \nThe increase in geographical coverage and the increase in network density can both \nbe seen in Figure 1. The current configuration has just over 140 stations, and allows \nthe detection and location of any earthquake of magnitude 2.5 ML or greater \nanywhere in the UK, even in bad noise conditions. For many parts of the country \ndetection capability is even better than this, giving data completeness down to \n1.5 ML or lower. \nIn addition to an increased number of stations, the last ten years has seen the \ndeployment of a greater number of low-gain instruments, strong motion recorders \nand broadband stations. A future plan is to shift the emphasis of the network to \nbroadband recording with a large dynamic range. A problem with the network during \nthe 1980s and 1990s was that most of the network consisted of instruments with \nrelatively narrow dynamic range and high gain. The high gain setting allowed the \ndetection of common small earthquakes, but less common larger earthquakes had a \ntendency to saturate the network. \nThe net result of BGS\u2019s seismic monitoring activity since 1969 is that the seismicity of \nthe UK in the last 35 years is known in great detail, even down to quite small \nmagnitudes. Thus for the instrumental period, we have a similar situation to the \nhistorical period, that although the seismicity itself is low in world terms, the data set \navailable for study is quite rich because it extends to low magnitudes. It is interesting \nto note that the spatial pattern of minor earthquake activity from recent instrumental \ndata, even if one takes only 5-10 years of data, very closely mirrors the long-term \nspatial pattern (which will be discussed in more detail later). The most significant \n 9\ndeviation is that little or no recent seismicity in South Wales west of the Rhondda has \nbeen detected, though this area has been notable for strong earthquakes in the past. \nThe UK earthquake catalogue \nThe first catalogue to combine historical data and modern instrumental results in a \nsystematic way is the published catalogue of Musson (1994). Although there is not, \nat the time of writing, any published update on this, the data file has been kept up to \ndate with regards to earthquakes occurring post-1994, and also revisions to historical \nearthquake parameters, and the inclusion of some events only recently discovered, \nof which the largest is the 1650 Galashiels earthquake, around 3.5 ML in size \n(Musson 2004b). The file at present has some restrictions according to parameters, \nas follows. For the period before 1700 the intention is to include all known events of \nmagnitude at least 4 ML; between 1700 and 1969, all events of magnitude at least \n3.0 ML; and thereafter all events of magnitude at least 2.0 ML. In practice the file \ndoes include events smaller than these limits, but not systematically. Small events \ncan be hard to catalogue for the historical period. For example, if a report states that \n\u201cseveral shocks were felt over the course of the following week\u201d, does one attempt to \nadd multiple parametric entries to reflect this or not? Because of the relative \nunimportance of very minor seismicity (especially aftershocks) one is inclined not to. \nParameters of historical earthquakes are estimated using the procedures described \nin Musson (1996a). The key parameter for determining magnitude is the area within \nthe isoseismal 3 EMS; or isoseismal 4 EMS if 3 is poorly defined; or felt area if there \nare no isoseismals. \nFor small earthquakes one typically may have a list of a few places where the shock \nwas felt, with little more detail preserved. In such cases the area defined by these \nplaces, with a small margin, is assumed to be the felt area and is assumed to be \nequivalent to isoseismal 3 EMS. One could argue in such cases that probably for the \nevent to be reported at all the intensity must be more likely to have been 4 EMS, and \ntherefore it would be more appropriate to use the equation for deriving magnitude \nfrom isoseismal 4 EMS. The difference would be, for example, for an event felt over \n600 km2, between a magnitude of 2.7 ML and 3.3 ML depending on whether one \nassumes intensity 3 or 4. It has been found in practice that the latter assumption \nleads to a discontinuity in the magnitude-frequency plot, suggesting that the former is \nmore accurate. \nThis leaves the problem of events reported from one place only, for example, the \nearthquake of 12 July 1852 of which the sole original report merely states that the \nearthquake was felt as a slight shock at Kilmarnock. In such cases, where there is no \nfelt area at all, the default is to set a magnitude of 2.0 ML. \nCatalogue completeness \nThe issue of the limits to which an earthquake catalogue is complete is an important \none, especially when investigating seismic hazard. There are two ways to estimate \nthis; the first is by statistical analysis of the data, and the second is by consideration \nof the nature of the sources. \nStatistical methods are mostly derived from the work of Stepp (1972) and assume \nthat occurrence rates are constant over time. Thus if one finds that the average rate \nof occurrence of earthquakes greater than magnitude M is lower for the period 1500-\n2000 than it is for 1800-2000, this is because for part of the period 1500-2000 the \ndata set is incomplete for magnitude M, and the missing events have lowered the \noverall rate. Using this principle, one can find the break point between the complete \nand incomplete parts of the catalogue. \n 10\nThe historical approach is to consider how well documented a period is for a \nparticular area. If there are many good written sources after (say) 1700, one may \nconclude that after 1700 it is inconceivable that if an earthquake of magnitude M had \noccurred, it would not have been reported in such a way that today we would know \nthat the earthquake had occurred. This is ultimately a judgement call, but it can be \nused to discriminate between regions that could never be analysed statistically \nbecause of few data. For instance, historical written sources for eastern Sutherland, \nCaithness and Orkney are much better than for western Sutherland; thus one can \ninfer that the earthquake record is more complete for the former area even though it \ncontains almost no earthquakes. \nTaking magnitude 4 ML as a reference point, historical judgement suggests that the \ncatalogue is probably complete as follows: \nRegion Start of completeness \nSouth England 1700 \nSouth-west England 1750 \nWales 1750 \nNorth England 1750 \nSouth Scotland 1700 \nNorth Scotland 1850 \nTable 1 - Regional earthquake catalogue completeness in the UK \nThe actual number of observed events in each of these regions by 50-year intervals \nis shown in Figure 2. \nA statistical analysis is shown in Figure 3 for the whole of mainland Great Britain, for \nmagnitudes 4 ML and 5 ML. These plots show the average number of events per \nyear for subcatalogues 1600-2005, 1605-2005, 1610-2005 \u2026 1995-2005. Reading \nthe graph from right to left, one has first a region where the average values fluctuate \nbecause the short subcatalogues are not representative. As the length of the record \ngrows, the value becomes a more stable representation of long-term rates, and then \nstarts a steady decline as one reaches the time period for which the catalogue is \nincomplete. For magnitude 4 ML this is about 1850. For magnitude 5 ML, about \n1770. \nIn any analysis of completeness, one is trying to estimate how many earthquakes, \nand of what size, are missing from the record. In Britain one is in the unusual \nsituation of actually knowing about a few cases of earthquakes that are missing \n(normally this is impossible \u2013 if one knew about them they wouldn\u2019t be missing). It \nappears that in June 1668 a largish earthquake occurred in the Scottish Borders, for \nwhich no documentary account whatever exists. That it happened can be inferred \nfrom two much later reports which use this date as a reference point in discussing \nlater earthquakes. Historically, it makes no sense to refer to this date unless it was \nthe date of another earthquake. One report is from Kendal, the other was written in \nEdinburgh but refers to Peebles, Kelso, Dumfries and Berwick. Thus this earthquake, \nfor which no description exists, must have affected a wide area of North England and \nSouth Scotland and have had a magnitude of at least 4.4 ML (Musson 2004b). \nA second similar case is the Ullapool earthquake of 1925, of which again there are \nno direct reports. When an earthquake occurred in the Dingwall area on 22 \nDecember 1925, it was mentioned that people who felt this earthquake in \nStrathpeffer compared the shock with one felt \u201cseveral weeks ago\u201d (so late \nNovember \u2013 early December) which was stronger in the Loch Broom district (North \n 11\nStar, 26 December 1925 p4). This suggests an earthquake with a magnitude of at \nleast 3.5 ML in north-west Scotland, for which no immediate record has survived. It is \nnot mentioned by Dollar (1950). \nI have also heard it rumoured that an earthquake of some strength was felt in \nwestern Scotland in the 1960s but it is hard to know what weight to put on this. \nNow that the basis for the data on British earthquakes has been described, and the \nlimitations on the data laid out, one can now move on to discuss the patterns of \nactivity that are revealed. \nBritish earthquakes in time \nAs is well known, the frequency of earthquakes is inversely proportional to their \nmagnitude such that \n Log N = a \u2013 b M      (1) \nwhere N is the cumulative number of events above magnitude M. This is known as \nthe Gutenberg-Richter law. Here this relationship is studied for an area comprising \nthe mainland of Great Britain, the Orkneys, the Irish Sea and the immediate waters \noff the east coast of Britain (Figure 4). In order to get the most out of the data, the \ncatalogue is divided into four periods and the data normalised accordingly. \nMagnitude 3.0-3.9 is analysed with respect to the period post 1970; 4.0-4.9 for the \nperiod after 1850; 5.0-5.5 from 1770 and 5.6 and above from 1550. This is a smaller \narea than was used in Musson (1994) and with more pessimistic assumptions about \ncompleteness. However, the results are not dissimilar. The constants a and b in \nequation (1) are determined to give the result: \n Log N = 3.59 \u2013 1.01 ML     (2) \nThis is shown in Figure 5. The fit is made using least squares, as this is probably \nmore appropriate than maximum likelihood given the fact that the graph is a \ncomposite over different historical periods. There is no indication that a truncated \nexponential relationship (as in Cornell and Vanmarcke 1969) would provide a better \nfit. \nOne can now compute the magnitude of earthquakes with different return periods \n(return period is the inverse of the annual probability of occurrence) for Great Britain \nas follows: \nReturn period \n(years) \nML \n1 3.5 \n10 4.5 \n100 5.5 \nTable 2 - UK earthquake return periods \nThe corresponding values given in Musson (1994) were 3.7, 4.7 and 5.6 ML. Note \nthat the analysis above is performed for the catalogue after removal of aftershocks \n(by hand) so applies to main shocks only.  \nIn Figure 5 there is a prominent bump in the curve around 5.0 ML, which is also \nevident in Musson (1994), where it was explained as being most likely due to a \ngreater number of earthquakes in the magnitude range 4.8-5.2 ML occurring by \nchance in the historical period of observation. More recent work (Musson 2005b) \ncasts doubt on this. Figure 6 shows, for the area in Figure 4, the number of \nearthquakes occurring within magnitude bands 4.0-4.1, 4.2-4.3, etc, for the period \n 12\nsince 1850. These are discrete values rather than cumulative ones. For the \nmagnitude range 4.2-5.2 the distribution is completely flat, and there is no indication \nthat an earthquake of exactly magnitude 4.2 ML is more likely than one of 5.2 ML. \nThe probability of this arising by chance, with a number of earthquakes this large, is \nextremely remote. This pattern is not uniform across the country; South Wales-\nHereford in particular seems to produce more earthquakes 4.8-5.2 ML than it does \n4.1-4.7 ML. The figures for the period since 1850 are seven and one respectively. \nThis is simply not compatible with a straightforward magnitude-frequency relationship \nof the form of equation (1). This behaviour is really rather peculiar. It suggests \nsomething approaching characteristic earthquake behaviour, although the strict \ncharacteristic model as originally proposed by Schwarz and Coppersmith (1984) \ndoes not seem to be appropriate (as it implies complete rupture of faults). \nDepth of British earthquakes \nDepth determinations for modern instrumental earthquakes are not always well \nconstrained, and those outside the network may be very poorly constrained. Depth \ndeterminations for historical earthquakes are derived from macroseismic \nobservations (the pattern of spacing of isoseismals), and this method often produces \nuncertain determinations. However, for events since 1970 for which both instrumental \nand macroseismic depth measurements have been possible, agreement is generally \ngood, and there is no systematic bias of macroseismic depths towards deeper or \nshallower estimates. \nFigure 7 shows a cross-section of British seismicity from roughly south to north along \nthe long axis of the island, 490 km long and 336 km wide. There is a tendency for \nseismicity to be shallower in the south, especially in Cornwall and Devon. Average \ndepth becomes slightly deeper as one progresses north, with some pockets of \nnotably deeper events in south and north Wales. Then in southern Scotland the \nseismicity is again shallow, becoming deeper to the north. Focal depths, specifically \nof the best-located modern earthquakes, were studied by Baptie (2002), who divided \nthe country into six regional areas, and found the shallowest mean depths in north-\nwest Scotland and Cornwall, with means of 5.7 km and 6.8 km. However, the dataset \nused is dominated by small-magnitude events, and these may not be representative \nof the pattern for larger earthquakes. \nOne thing that is significant about Figure 7 from a practical point of view is that there \ndoes appear to be a correlation between magnitude and depth. This is shown more \nclearly in Figure 8. Only two earthquakes are both larger than 4 ML and have depths \nof 5 km or less. It is clear that larger earthquakes are much more likely to nucleate in \nthe crystalline basement than the upper crustal layers. \nThe depth at which earthquakes can nucleate is controlled by the depth of the brittle-\nductile transition, which limits the possibility of brittle failure. The depth of this \ndepends on factors such as geothermal gradient, mineral composition, the presence \nof fluids and the tectonic strain rate. Information on crustal structure in the UK dates \nback to the LISPB refraction experiments in the 1970s (Bamford et al 1978). A study \nby Whittaker and Chadwick (1984) identified three broad zones with depth, of which \nthe lowest, consisting probably mostly of heavily tectonised metamorphic gneisses, is \ncharacterised by ductile deformation. The top of this layer, and therefore the limit to \nthe seismogenic zone, is considered to vary between 11 and 22 km. However, some \nearthquake depths do exceed this, especially in Wales, western Scotland, and an \narea around the Humber. This may be due to lower geothermal gradients causing \nbrittle behaviour even in the lower crust. \nWhen one combines the observed depth distribution with the small rupture sizes to \nbe expected for earthquakes of the typical magnitude experienced in the UK, it \n 13\nbecomes clear that the likelihood of any British earthquake producing surface rupture \nis extremely small. No surface rupture has ever been reported in any British \nearthquake in modern or historical times. Stewart et al (2001) review the evidence for \npalaeoseismic surface rupture in Scotland and conclude that the evidence that has \nbeen advanced in other studies for such rupture is unreliable. \nRegional character of British seismicity \nThe character of UK seismicity varies considerably from region to region. Before \ndiscussing the relationship of seismicity to geology, it will be appropriate to give some \nattention to discussion of the spatial pattern of earthquakes in the UK. This is shown \nin Figure 9. \nIt has been hypothesised (Ove Arup 1993) that the distribution of earthquakes in the \nUK can be considered to be entirely a chance artefact, and that seismicity is in fact \nrandom over the whole country. This hypothesis can be disproved by the application \nof statistical tests for random distribution (Musson 2000a). The variation in seismic \nbehaviour between different parts of the country is real and significant, and therefore \nleads to questions as to why this should be so. The different regions will now be \ndiscussed in turn, working roughly north to south. \n1) Scottish Highlands \nThe Western Highlands of Scotland comprise one of the more actively seismic areas \nin the UK. Seismicity is quite strong within a zone reaching from Dunoon to Ullapool. \nWithin this, however, the pattern of epicentres is to some extent clustered. One can \nobserve an almost linear band of activity from Dunoon, through Oban to Moidart, \nrunning NNW-SSE. A second cluster near Fort William is also sublinear with a north-\neast-south-west trend, paralleling the Great Glen, but south of it. A third cluster is \nfound around Kintail, which was very active in the 1970s, but some historical \nepicentres are also found here. A smaller cluster near Ullapool saw some swarm \nactivity in 1987. \nHow much this pattern is influenced by poor locations is hard to say. Some historical \nearthquakes in this region are clearly very poorly constrained, especially early events \nsuch as the large 1597 earthquake, which is plotted in Figure 9 round about Glen \nGarry, but could in truth easily be further north, south or west. An earthquake in 1817 \nwas felt in Glasgow and Edinburgh and Inverness, but in the absence of any reports \nfrom the epicentral area, the location of it is greatly uncertain. The epicentre of the 28 \nNovember 1880 earthquake (5.2 ML) has been disputed, and the subject was \nreviewed by Musson (1989b). Principia (1982) placed the epicentre west of Coll, and \nthis is found also in e.g. Ambraseys (1988). It now seems clear that the epicentre \nwas between Oban and Inveraray, but this is not very precise. Even in the 20th \ncentury, the earthquake of 16 August 1934 was considered by Dollar (1950) to have \nan epicentre near Inverness (largely as a result of jumping to conclusions); Principia \n(1982) placed it somewhere in the wilds of Strathconon Forest. Musson (1989a) \nconcluded that a series of small events in the Torridon area shortly following this \nearthquake were in fact aftershocks, and relocated the event to Torridon; thus the \nepicentre has \u201cdrifted\u201d from the east coast to the west coast in subsequent studies. \nOne can overestimate this problem. If one restricts consideration to events post-\n1975, which should be mostly well-located, the spatial pattern is not dissimilar. \nFurthermore, many historical determinations are not subject to much doubt. One can \nconsider examples such as the sequence of small but strongly-felt events in the \nStrontian area in 1809, which clearly had epicentres close to Strontian. The 26 \nDecember 1946 Lochaber earthquake (4.1 ML) is located from macroseismic data, \nbut these are sufficiently detailed and copious that one can locate the earthquake \nwith some confidence to Glen Roy. \n 14\nIt has been suggested, e.g. by Browitt et al (1976) that historical earthquake \nepicentres in Scotland \u201cmigrate\u201d to valleys because this is where the population is, \nand hence where the felt reports are. To some extent this is obviously true; a \nhistorical earthquake with an epicentre in a completely remote area can only be \nknown from reports from the nearest settled area, and if the earthquake is not strong \nenough to be felt over a wide area, the nearest cluster of villages will appear to be \nthe location of the event. That said, in many cases the data are sufficiently good that \none can see that this effect is not occurring. One might suppose that epicentres are \nnaturally drawn to the Great Glen due to considerations of human geography; but the \nmacroseismic locations of the 1839 Invergarry and 1858 Stratherrick earthquakes are \nboth east of the great Glen. \nOf particular note are the Inverness earthquakes of 1816, 1890 and 1901. What \nrelation these have to the other seismicity of northern Scotland is hard to say. There \nhas been a historical tendency to assume that the Great Glen Fault (GGF) must be \nactive because there are earthquakes in its vicinity, and therefore that the \nearthquakes in its vicinity must have occurred on it, because it is an active fault \u2013 a \ncircular argument. Thus Davison (1924) assumes that the 1888 Invergarry \nearthquake must have occurred on the GGF, although careful scrutiny of the data \nwould have shown this to be clearly not the case. The 1934 \u201cInverness\u201d earthquake \nhas already been mentioned; likewise the 1946 Lochaber earthquake, which is \ncategorically stated to be a GGF earthquake by Dollar (1947) solely on the grounds \nof rough proximity, and the assumption that the GGF is \u201cactive\u201d. \nThe three earthquakes of 1816, 1890 and 1901 occurred just to the south-west of the \ncity of Inverness, and all three had substantial aftershock sequences, which aid in the \naccurate location of the main shock. The magnitudes were 5.1, 4.5 and 5.0 ML and \ndamage from the two larger ones was considerable. It was reported of the 1816 \nearthquake that it was fortunate that at the moment it occurred, the streets were \ndeserted, otherwise there would certainly have been casualties from the shower of \nbricks and tiles that fell. The 1901 earthquake caused a crack to appear in the canal \ntowpath at Dochgarroch \u2013 this is evidently a ground failure effect rather than a fault \ntrace, but even ground failure effects are uncommon in British earthquakes. The \nepicentre of the 1901 earthquake appears to be at Dochgarroch, and this is actually \non the trace of the GGF, but it is also at the point where a north-south trending fault \nsplays off to the north, according to Horne and Hinxman (1914), and the 1816 and \n1890 epicentres are to the north and compatible with this fault. As will be discussed \nlater, north-south and east-west trending faults are more likely to be reactivated given \nthe prevailing stress direction, so this minor fault, if it is present at seismogenic \ndepths, is probably more likely to be the causative feature of the Inverness \nearthquakes than the GGF. However, even if this fault were directly responsible for \nthe Inverness sequences, this does not mean that the GGF is uninvolved, as will be \ndiscussed further below. \nSince 1901 there have been no earthquakes around Inverness at all. Given that three \nsignificant earthquakes have occurred here in historical times, it seems not \nunreasonable to expect that a fourth may occur at some future date. Such a future \nevent should settle the question as to the cause of the Inverness earthquakes; on the \nother hand, given the growth of the city since 1901, the human consequences may \nbe unfortunate. \nOutside the main zone of activity in the Western Highlands, there is some more or \nless diffuse seismicity in the Inner Hebrides-Kintyre area, from Mull to Arran. The 4 \nMarch 1999 Arran earthquake (4.0 ML) was the last event at time of writing to have \nbeen widely felt in Scotland. The epicentre was off the south of Arran. \n 15\nThe rest of Northern Scotland has very little seismicity. The Outer Hebrides are \naseismic; there is very little activity in Sutherland, Caithness, the Orkneys and \nShetlands (Musson 1998b). All of the Grampians, Aberdeenshire, Buchan etc is \nalmost completely without known seismicity; the Aviemore earthquake of 28 August \n1995 (2.7 ML) which was felt by many, was unusual in occurring in such an area. \n2) Central Scotland \nA characteristic feature of much British seismicity is the occurrence of earthquake \nswarms. An earthquake swarm is defined as a series of earthquakes, usually small, \nwith no clear main shock. The classic example is the Vogtland area on the German-\nCzech border (Gr\u00fcnthal 1989). Swarms may contain hundreds of events extending \nover a period of weeks or months. In Britain swarms vary as regards their character, \nand may be quite short. The Ullapool sequence of 1987 has already been mentioned; \nit lasted for about a month, in which time ten events over 2.0 ML were recorded, \nincluding two 3.0 ML shocks and one 2.9 ML. The Manchester earthquake sequence \nof October 2002, while having what could technically be regarded as a main shock, \nwas very swarm-like in character (Baptie and Ottem\u00f6ller 2004). \nThe seismicity of Central Scotland is dominated by two swarm centres that have \nbeen active repeatedly: Comrie and the Ochil Hills. The first of these was important \nfor the history of seismology. \nThe Comrie activity is known mostly through historical data; considering that at its \nheight scores of shocks were being felt in Comrie village per day, for a protracted \nperiod, the total number of events that would have been recorded had modern \ninstrumentation been available must have been immense. The typical Comrie swarm \nincludes one or two large earthquakes, so it could be debated whether these are true \nswarms or just large earthquakes with abnormally intense foreshock and aftershock \nsequences (K\u00e1rn\u00edk 1992 pers. comm.). \nThe history of Comrie activity can be summarised as follows: \n8 November 1608 \u2013 a large earthquake widely felt in Scotland, which caused \ndamage at Perth, most likely originated at Comrie, but due to the early historical \nperiod no records are available closer than Perth. No information is therefore \navailable as to whether it was followed by more activity; a strong earthquake in \nScotland on 9 March 1622 may have been related, but this later event is so badly \ndocumented that there is no way to locate it. \n7 September 1801 \u2013 swarm activity started at Comrie in 1788, and this time the \nactivity was chronicled by two local ministers, so a good account of the sequence is \npreserved (Milne 1842-4). The activity reached a climax with a 4.6 ML event in 1801, \nwhich was felt between Inverness and southern Scotland, and was reputed to have \noccasioned the collapse of part of a barn near Edinburgh, killing two labourers who \nwere sleeping there and injuring some others. \n23 October 1839 \u2013 after the 1801 earthquake activity at Comrie decreased to a low, \nintermittent level, and then at the beginning of October 1839, the shocks resumed, \nwith a crescendo over the space of three weeks to a 4.8 ML event on 23 October \u2013 \nthe largest Comrie event known. This was followed by extremely intense swarm \nactivity until 1846, with two more shocks exceeding 4 ML in magnitude. The \nearthquakes were intensively investigated by two amateur seismologists in Comrie \nvillage, and a committee formed by the British Association for the Advancement of \nScience (Milne 1842-4, Musson 1993b). \nAfter the decline of activity in 1846, seismicity in Comrie has remained at a low, \nintermittent level. An apparent resumption in the 1860s led to the reconvening of the \nBAAS committee, but this turned out to be a false alarm. \n 16\nThe Ochil Hills swarm activity has been quite different in character. The first \nearthquake we know of that was clearly in this location occurred on 30 April 1736. \nThe main historical period of swarm activity for the Ochil Hills was between 1900-\n1916, studied by Charles Davison (1916, 1924) from macroseismic data (and it is a \nmatter of speculation how many of the events he noted as swarm earthquakes were, \nin fact, quarry blasts). While one could argue that the Comrie activity is not true \nswarm activity because, for instance, in the 1788-1801 period one can distinguish the \n7 September 1801 event as a clear mainshock, the same is not the case for the \nOchils. The largest of the Ochil Hills earthquakes never reached 4 ML in magnitude; \nthe larger events were between 3.1 ML and 3.7 ML. \nA further brief swarm occurred between 1979 and 1980, the largest event being \nagain, a mere 3.2 ML. \nDavison (1924) believed that the Ochil Hills earthquakes occurred along the Ochil \nFault that bounds the southern edge of the range of hills; but of course, this is also \nwhere the settlements are. Instrumental locations for the 1979 earthquakes show \nlocations further north, in the hillsides around Glendevon. This is another example of \nthe migration of macroseismic locations towards settled areas. \nIn 1940 two earthquakes (3.3 and 3.7 ML) took place near Stirling (the second was \nnearer to Kilsyth). Arguably, these could be regarded as related to the Ochils activity. \nElsewhere in Central Scotland, small earthquakes have occurred under Glasgow \nfrom time to time, the most recent being in 1964. \n3) Southern Scotland \nSouthern Scotland is an area of very low seismicity, with the exception of Galashiels, \nwhere events took place in 1650, 1728 and 1844, and the area around Dumfries and \nLockerbie, where a number of earthquakes, all minor, have occurred over the years. \n4) Northern England \nThe pattern of earthquake activity in Northern England is quite distinct. A narrow \nzone of relatively strong earthquake activity (up to 4.9 ML) runs along the Pennines, \nall the way from the Peak District up to the Scottish Border, where it stops abruptly. \nTwo strong earthquakes have occurred at the Border, a relatively recent event on 26 \nDecember 1979 (4.7 ML), with epicentre near Longtown (north of Carlisle), seems to \nhave resembled closely an earlier event in 1650 (Musson 2004b). \nWensleydale seems to have been repeatedly active in historical times: in 1768, 1780 \nand 1933. Other focal points have been Weardale, Kirby Stephen, Skipton, \nTodmorden, and the Peak District itself. Derbyshire is noted for a sequence of three \nevents in 1903, 1904 and 1906, of which the first two were widely felt, and was also \nthe probable location of strong shocks in 1575 and 1683. The pattern of seismicity \naround the southern end of the Pennines is quite diffuse. The record of modern \nseismicity is contaminated by mining-induced events; it can be hard to distinguish, \nespecially for older events, what is mining-related seismicity and what is natural \nseismicity in a mining district. One assumes, for instance, a natural origin for the 17 \nMarch 1816 Mansfield earthquake (4.2 ML), but recent low-magnitude seismicity in \nthe Mansfield area has been of a mining character. On the other side of the Peak \nDistrict, the possibility of earthquakes within the Manchester area had been \ndemonstrated by the 14 September 1777 event (4.4 ML), and a smaller event near \nSalford in 1931, but this was not really a precedent for what occurred in 2002, when \na 3.9 ML event in the eastern part of the city was followed by over a hundred \naftershocks, many of them felt. \nWest of the Pennines, the situation in the Lake District is unclear. The Lake District \ndome has been subject to a scattering of seismicity, mostly events less than 4 ML \n 17\n(the exception being the 4.1 ML earthquake in the Northern Lake District in 1901). A \nnumber of small earthquakes have occurred around the edges of the dome, but \nthese have tended to be shallow, and therefore some of them have been rather \nstrongly felt locally. The extreme case is the 15 February 1865 earthquake (Musson \n1998c); this event can be accurately located close to the village of Rampside, just \neast of Barrow-in-Furness. This village was heavily damaged, with liquefaction \neffects (sand fountains) in the saturated sands on the foreshore. Yet 10 km away the \nearthquake was hardly perceptible. This illustrates the difficulty of determining \nearthquake magnitude from maximum intensity. The Barrow earthquake had a \nepicentral intensity of 8 EMS; so using maximum intensity as an analogue of \nmagnitude would class this event as one of the largest British earthquakes; yet when \nthe magnitude is calculated from felt area, it is less than 3 ML. \nThe key event for the Lake District is the earthquake that occurred on 11 August \n1786; this had a magnitude of 5.0 ML, making it the largest Northern England event \nwith the possible exception of the poorly-understood 26 February 1575 earthquake. \nThe epicentre was offshore from Whitehaven, and is sufficiently close to the major \nLake District Boundary Fault (LDBF) that marks the western edge of the Lake District \nto raise questions as to whether the LDBF can be considered \u201cactive\u201d. As is so often \nthe case, the LDBF is not a simple structure, but consists of a fault zone of \nanastamosing traces. A small earthquake (< 3 ML) on 17 November 1755 caused \nstrong shaking at the village of Irton, south-west of Whitehaven; this event seems \ntherefore to have been shallow, and occurred within the LDBF zone. Given a narrow \ndefinition of what constitutes an \u201cactive\u201d fault, the 1755 event is perhaps more \nsignificant for the LDBF than the offshore 1786 event, even though the latter is much \nlarger. However, whether such a definition is appropriate will be considered in the \nfinal section of the present paper. \nIn contrast, the north-east of England is an area of extremely low seismicity, from \nNorthumberland down to York. The exception is an earthquake with estimated \nmagnitude of 4.4 ML offshore from Whitby, which may be related to a belt of \nseismicity extending offshore from Flamborough Head, which will be touched on \nlater. \n5) Wales and the Marches \nThe seismicity of Wales has been discussed in detail elsewhere (Musson 2005b). \nThere is a distinct division of Welsh seismicity into four areas: Snowdonia, the rest of \nNorth Wales, Central Wales, and South Wales. It is convenient to take the latter zone \nas extending across the English border and bending up north-eastwards through \nHerefordshire and Shropshire. \nSnowdonia is one of the most concentrated active seismic areas in the UK. The \nlargest known onshore British earthquake occurred here on 17 July 1984 (5.4 ML), \nwith a well-located epicentre near Yr Eifel in the Lleyn Peninsula. Very similar \nearthquakes occurred on 9 November 1852 and 7 October 1690. The poorly-\ndocumented earthquake of July 1534 was probably similar, and it could be \nconjectured that the earthquake of 20 February 1247, most likely one of the strongest \nMedieval British earthquakes, also originated in this area. The 1852 and 1984 \nearthquakes were felt in all of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales, which is \nunusual for a British earthquake. The 1690 earthquake may have been felt in all four, \nbut there is no extant report from Scotland. 1247 was felt in all four. The 1852 and \n1984 earthquakes, both very well documented, caused little damage, indicative of \ndeep foci. The depth of the 1984 earthquake is instrumentally determined at 18 km \n(Turbitt et al 1985). The 1984 earthquake actually caused more damage to poorly-\nmaintained chimneys in Liverpool than it did in the epicentral area. \n 18\nIn addition to these characteristic large earthquakes at intervals of around 150 years, \nlesser earthquakes also occur, including two that were over 4.5 ML in 1903 and \n1940. The larger events seem to have occurred on the south-western side of the \nSnowdonian Massif, though all except 1984 are not very well located. More recent \nsmall-magnitude seismicity, on the other hand, is also observed on the north-west \nside of Snowdonia, and there is historical data for small earthquakes occurring on the \nnorth-east side. A point of interest concerning the 1940 earthquake is that it was the \nlast British earthquake to date that caused fatalities, with a death toll of two (Musson \n2003). \nAway from Snowdonia, seismicity in the rest of North Wales tends to be diffuse and \ncharacterised by events not exceeding 4 ML in magnitude.  \nCentral Wales is characterised by low seismicity. Some small earthquakes have \noccurred, especially around Newtown and Brecon, but the coasts of Cardigan Bay \nsouth of Harlech show very little seismic activity. \nSouth Wales is another story. Here strong earthquakes (around 5 ML) are relatively \ncommon; in fact, disproportionately so. According to the Gutenberg-Richter \nrelationship, as discussed previously, for every unit decrease in magnitude, there \nshould be around a tenfold increase in frequency. This does not happen in South \nWales; there are more recorded events around 5 ML in magnitude than around 4 ML. \nThis is true over an area that runs not only along the South Wales coast, but curves \nup through Herefordshire and into Shropshire. Swansea seems to have been \nparticularly affected, with notable earthquakes close to the city in 1727, 1775, 1832, \n1868 and 1906. The first and last of these were the strongest: the 1906 earthquake \nhad a magnitude of 5.2 ML and caused considerable damage to houses (mostly to \nchimneys and plaster). Since 1906, the only earthquake near Swansea has been a \n3.2 ML in 1930. \nIn south-east Wales, there has been recent seismicity in the Newport area, especially \nin the 1970s, but south-west Wales appears as almost a complete blank on maps of \nmodern instrumentally recorded earthquakes (i.e. since 1970). This is unusual, \nbecause for the most part the spatial distribution of the seismicity of the last thirty \nyears matches very well the long-term pattern. In south-west Wales this \ncorrespondence breaks down, and one would not suspect from modern data that this \npart of the country was subject to strong earthquakes, which it has been in the past. \nTwo key earthquakes are those of 18 August 1892 and 3 November 1893. The first \n(5.1 ML) had an epicentre near Pembroke, the second (5.0 ML) near Carmarthen. \nThese two earthquakes make an interesting comparison. They were located quite \nclose in both space and time, but the distribution of effects was totally different. The \nPembroke earthquake was felt strongly to the south of the area of maximum effects, \nbeing widely perceived in Cornwall and Devon, but was little felt in North Wales. The \nCarmarthen earthquake was the complete reverse of this (Musson et al 1984). All \nelse being equal, it appears that this can only be explained by differences in the \nsource effects on the radiation pattern. \nAcross the border from eastern Wales into England, the same pattern can be seen, \nwith magnitude values of 5.2, 5.3, 4.8 and 5.1 ML for earthquakes in 1863, 1896, \n1926 and 1990 in Hereford and Shropshire, and a lack of events in the 4.0-4.5 ML \nrange.  \n6) English Midlands and East of England \nThere are no very clear divisions between the seismicity of the Welsh Marches to the \nwest, the Peak District\/South Yorkshire to the north, and the English Midlands. For \nthe most part, central and south-east England are areas that are not very active \nseismically, but there is not a sharp transition between high and low seismicity, and \n 19\nthere are patches of notable activity in what might be considered relatively stable \nareas. \nThus, for example, even when mining-related seismicity is removed from the \nStaffordshire area, one can still see some significant earthquakes 4.5 < ML < 5.0, \nnotably the 1916 Stafford earthquake and the 2002 Dudley earthquake. \nParticularly prominent is a concentration of seismicity around Leicester, where nine \nearthquakes > 3 ML have occurred in the last 250 years. The largest of these took \nplace on 9 February 1953; this had a magnitude of 5.3 ML and caused damage in the \nDerby-Loughborough area, including damage to Blackbrook reservoir (making it one \nof three British earthquakes to have caused damage to dams, the other two being the \n1839 Comrie and 1979 Ochil Hills earthquakes). A child in Derby suffered a fractured \nskull. \nEast of this area, one can make out a line of epicentres (which may or may not be a \ncoincidence) of sporadic events as far as the vicinity of Norwich, where a magnitude \n4.0 ML event occurred in 1994. An earthquake in 1480 caused damage in Norwich, \nbut little else is know about this earthquake. \nIn Lincolnshire there is little seismicity besides a 4.2 ML event on 1 August 1755, but \nwe know that Lincoln cathedral was badly damaged by an earthquake in 1185. Was \nthis a strong local earthquake with epicentre similar to that of the 1755 event, or was \nit an offshore earthquake similar to the 1931 North Sea event, as first proposed by \nDavison (1931)? The latter explanation seems inherently more likely, since the \nlargest British earthquakes for which magnitudes can be estimated are all offshore \nevents. Possible evidence for a strong local Lincoln event in 1185 can be adduced \nfrom folklore relating to destroyed villages in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, if any \nweight can be put on this. Archaeoseismic investigations in Lincolnshire would be \ninteresting. \nEssex is a county completely devoid of earthquakes except for one \u2013 which ironically \nwas the most damaging British earthquake in the last 400 years. The infamous \nColchester earthquake of 22 April 1884 was not especially large (4.6 ML) but it was \nshallow (3 km) and occurred below a populated area. The epicentre was near the \nvillage of Peldon, south of Colchester, and in Peldon and the surrounding villages \nand farmhouses, damage was quite severe, amounting to an intensity of 8 EMS. \nThere exist numerous photographs and drawings of the damage; however, some of \nthe former were faked to make the damage appear worse than it was (Musson 1990). \nA few people were hurt by falling stones, but the only fatalities were an old woman in \nWivenhoe, on her death bed, whose \u201cend was hastened by the shock\u201d, and a woman \nin Manningtree who was so distressed by the whole occurrence she threw herself in \nthe River Stour a few days later (Musson et al 1990, Musson 2003). A lurid book-\nlength account of this earthquake by Haining (1976) is quite unreliable. (For example, \nHaining relates how in London the earthquake toppled a lamp in Bow Street \nMagistrates Court, causing a fire. In fact, the fire in Bow Street occurred after the \nearthquake, was caused by a servant girl upsetting a candle in an inn, and did not \naffect the Magistrates Court.) One conclusion to be drawn from the 1884 earthquake \nis that, even in the most aseismic places, an earthquake at least up to 4.5 ML can \noccur, and can cause damage if it is shallow enough \u2013 even if this is a rare event. \nThe rest of the Home Counties have little seismicity of note, though one should \nmention two small earthquakes in 1750 (8 February, 2.6 ML, and 8 March, 3.1 ML) \nwith epicentres in Central London (the first near Leadenhall Street, the second near \nLambeth, within an accuracy of a few kilometres). Some minor damage was caused. \nIt is interesting to speculate on the consequences of a recurrence of a similar event \ntoday in the same place, and whether a larger event could occur. By analogy with \nColchester 1884, one cannot rule out something like a 4.5 ML at the very least.  \n 20\nIn addition, the Chichester area seems to be another location for possible swarm-like \nactivity; a small swarm occurred in the 1830s, and there was some seismicity in this \narea in 1963 and the early 1970s. \n7) South-west England \nThe south-west of England is characterised by seismicity that never seems to rise \nmuch above 4 ML in magnitude. The most active areas are western Cornwall, \nespecially around Penzance and Helston, the Launceston-Tavistock area, and the \nnorth coast of Cornwall extending up into North Devon. The seismicity of Cornwall \nand Devon has been studied exhaustively by Musson (1989c), and the seismicity of \nthe peninsula is also discussed in Musson (2000b). \nWhile Somerset has seen a few small earthquakes, most recently a 3.1 ML double \nevent near Bridgwater in 2004, Dorset and Wiltshire are very inactive.  \nAs mentioned previously, one must be careful with discussions of the 11 September \n1275 event. Some popular publications attribute this to a Cornish source, on the \ngrounds that it destroyed Mount St Michael (near Penzance). In fact, what was \ndestroyed was St Michael\u2019s on the Mount, which is the name of the church on \nGlastonbury Tor. But putting an epicentre in Somerset (as in Ambraseys and Melville \n1983) is unlikely to be correct. Damage to one very anomalous construction perched \non a steep hill is not indicative that the earthquake source nearby. Musson (1994) \nsuggests a possible epicentre near Chichester on the basis of what is stated \nconcerning places where the earthquake was felt. The annals of Osney (Luard 1868-\n9) state that people were killed by this earthquake \u2013 this is the only contemporaneous \nrecord that refers to deaths in a medieval British earthquake. \n8) Offshore seismicity \nSeismicity offshore is also strongly localised. The area of the Viking Graben and \nSouth M\u00f8re Basin, in the northern North Sea, is perhaps the most active seismic \narea in Europe north of the Alps. The question is sometimes asked whether the \nstrong seismicity here has anything to do with hydrocarbon extraction, but it is clear \nthat seismicity in the Northern North Sea long preceded oil extraction. An earthquake \non 4 January 1879 can be identified as having occurred in this area because it was \nfelt on both sides of the North Sea, in Norway and Shetland. With other reports from \nthe same period for which there are only reports from one coast, one cannot be sure \nif these are significant earthquakes some distance offshore or very minor ones close \nto land. \nThe earthquake of 24 January 1927 (5.7 ML) was the second largest British \nearthquake of the 20th Century. It was felt over most of Scotland and down the east \ncoast of England as far as Norfolk, and in Western Norway. It caused no damage to \nbuildings (Musson et al 1986). \nSouth of the Viking Graben, the Central Graben system of the North Sea appeared \ninactive until recently; but until recently seismic monitoring was insufficient to detect \nany but the largest events occurring so far from land. Here there is rather more \nevidence that at least some seismic activity may be induced (Ottem\u00f6ller et al 2005). \nThere is a marked belt of seismic activity off the east coast of England from \nFlamborough Head, stretching south-eastwards down to a latitude of 53o N. The \nmost notable earthquake here was the 7 June 1931 event; with a magnitude of \n6.1 ML it is the largest British earthquake for which magnitude can be estimated. It \nwas felt over a very extensive area: more or less the whole of Great Britain, eastern \nIreland, and parts of northern France, the Low Countries, northern Germany, \nDenmark and western Scandinavia (Versey 1939, Neilson et al 1986). Damage \n 21\noccurred along the east coast of England, but was minor in character. One woman \ndied in Hull from a heart attack. \nTwo of the strongest British earthquakes, with magnitudes between 5.5 and 6.0 ML, \nhad epicentres in the Dover Straits. The dates of these two events were 21 May 1382 \nand 6 April 1580, and they seem to have been very similar in all respects. The latter \nof the two is, of course, the better documented; it was felt strongly in London, where \nthere was some damage, and two children were killed in Christ Church Newgate. \nRepairs to the damage to the tower of St Peter\u2019s Broadstairs are still visible (Figure \n10). Effects on the French side of the Straits were as bad, if not worse, with damage \nat Calais, Boulogne and elsewhere. An unknown number were killed on the \ncontinent. Contrary to some reports (e.g. Varley 1996) the earthquake did not cause \na tsunami, although the earthquake shaking was enough to disturb the water in \nKentish harbours. Reports of coastal inundation and ships sinking probably relate to \nthe effects of a storm the following year (Melville et al 1996). A lesser earthquake, but \nstill with magnitude probably > 5 ML, occurred in this same area in 1449 (Musson \n1994, Melville et al 1996). Since 1580, there have been only two much smaller \nearthquakes in this area, in 1776 and 1950 (4.1 and 4.4 ML respectively). Evidently, \nif the 1382 earthquake can repeat itself in 1580, it must be possible that it could \nrepeat itself again in the future; given the increase in urban development in south-\neast England and the Pas de Calais, one must consider that the consequences of \nsuch a repeat event could be considerable. \nMoving westwards, there has been a certain amount of seismicity in the English \nChannel, including historical events up to 5.1 ML in magnitude, but the greatest \nconcentration has been in the Channel Islands, and close to France. Since the \n1980s, a cluster of events has been observed west of the Scilly Isles. Although one \nmust wonder whether these are real earthquakes or man-made events (for example, \nmunitions disposal), it seems most likely that these are real earthquakes (Walker \n1994, pers. comm.) \nThe Irish Sea is not very seismically active; however, one strong earthquake (5.1 ML) \ndid occur in 1843 with an epicentre between the Isle of Man and Morecambe Bay. \nOtherwise the only event of note is an earthquake in 1951 just off the coast of County \nWicklow. This was felt over a wider area than its instrumental magnitude of 3.7 ML \nwould suggest, giving it a macroseismic magnitude of 4.4 ML. It is the strongest Irish \nearthquake on record, indeed, practically the only Irish earthquake of any \nsignificance. The aseismicity of Ireland is very notable, and not due to lack of data. \nOn 14 December 2005 a 2.8 ML earthquake in the Irish Sea was felt in Wicklow, with \na not dissimilar epicentre to the 1951 event (Bukits 2006) \u2013 the distance between the \ntwo epicentres is 27 km, but the 2005 event is much more accurately located. \nFor the most part, the seas around Scotland west of the Viking Graben have almost \nno seismicity. There is palaeoseismic evidence for large earthquakes on the \ncontinental slope north and west of the UK (Musson 2006), and ambiguous (and \nweak) evidence for an anomalously large event having occurred in historical times \n(Musson 2004b, 2006), analogous to the 1927 Grand Banks (Newfoundland) \nearthquake, which was a case of a large (>7 Mw) earthquake on a passive margin in \nan area otherwise aseismic. \nSeismicity of Britain in relation to geological structure \nThe quest for an understanding of how the distribution of seismicity in the UK relates \nto geological structure has been a long and unfruitful one, starting with the various \nstudies by Davison (1924), who was the first British seismologist to understand the \nrelationship of earthquakes to faulting, after formative studies by, for instance, Reid \n(1910); although it was realised by David Milne as early as the 1840s (Milne 1842-4) \n 22\nthat a connection existed between earthquakes and faults. The British Isles have a \ncomplex geological and tectonic structure as a result of a complex geological history \ninvolving several orogenic phases. If one looks first at the situation in terms of gross \ncrustal structure, one can divide Britain into a number of geological provinces or \nterranes. These are shown in Figure 11, adapted from Chadwick et al (1996) after \nWhittaker et al (1989). It is immediately apparent that there is no correlation between \nterranes and seismicity. Although one could argue that these crustal blocks are \nroughly homogeneous in terms of crustal properties, including styles and distribution \nof faulting, this is not reflected in any homogeneity of seismicity. Some other factor, \nor factors, is affecting the distribution of seismicity. \nThe problem can be summarised neatly with one question: why is Ireland so \naseismic? The absence of Irish epicentres from maps of the seismicity of the British \nIsles is nothing to do with absence of data; documentary sources for Irish seismicity \nare at least as good as those for, say, Wales, and modern instrumental monitoring \nalso demonstrates a remarkable lack of seismic activity in Ireland. Indeed, even a \nsource as ancient as Ware (1662) remarks on the absence of earthquakes in Ireland. \nYet geologically, many structures are common to both Ireland and Britain, and there \nis no obvious discontinuity that could explain why the seismicity stops at the Irish \nSea. \nIn the last decades, therefore, there has been a search for some factor X that could \nbe considered as the control on the distribution of seismicity. This is far from being a \nmerely academic pursuit. Consider the situation that would arise if it were planned to \nbuild some sensitive facility at Stonehaven, close to where the Highland Boundary \nFault (HBF) intersects the east coast of Scotland. If one supposes that the high \nseismicity that has been concentrated around Comrie in historical times is due to the \nHBF in some directly causative way, it seems perfectly likely that similar seismicity in \nthe future could occur anywhere along the HBF, including at Stonehaven. However, if \nthe Comrie seismicity is due to some other factor unique to Comrie, future swarms \nshould recur at Comrie and not at Stonehaven. The difference in terms of hazard is \nconsiderable, and the implications in terms of required antiseismic design could \namount to millions of pounds. \nThe general difficulty with all work on this subject is that it has been of the order of \nlooking for correlations between seismicity and some other factor, with the success of \nthe hypothesis \u201cthe controlling factor for British seismicity is X\u201d being judged by how \nwell X shows a spatial correlation with a map of epicentres. No factor shows a perfect \ncorrelation; and if any did, it would have no predictive power. If one could identify \nsome factor X such that wherever X occurred there were earthquakes, and wherever \nX was lacking there were no earthquakes, there would be no places where one might \ninfer that earthquakes could occur in the future even though they have not done so in \nthe past (c.f. Stonehaven in the preceding illustration). In such a case, one might \nsimply say that earthquakes occur where they have occurred. What one needs \nideally is a mechanistic theory, the success of which can be judged other than by \nspatial correlation. \nSome proposals can now be examined, concentrating on modern studies. \nPalaeogene-Neogene deformation \nA study by Muir Wood (1989) of Eocene and post-Eocene tectonics in Western \nEurope identified four phases when intraplate deformation was concentrated along \nlinear zones stretching from the Mediterranean to the mid-Atlantic ridge; Muir Wood \n(1989) considers these zones to have acted as sub-plate boundaries within the \nEurasian plate. These are shown in Figure 12. Each resulted in significant \ndeformation in the British Isles in the following four phases: \n 23\n1. Middle-late Eocene: southern and south-western England \n2. Early Oligocene: eastern and northern England and most of Scotland \n3. Late Oligocene: southern England, western Wales, eastern Ireland, Hebrides \n4. Late Miocene: all of Britain except eastern England and eastern Scotland, all \nof Ireland except Munster \nIt is easy to pick out features that appear to be convenient as explanatory variables. \nOne could argue that areas subject to active deformation in the late Miocene \ncontinue to be active, and this explains nicely why eastern Scotland and north-\neastern England are so inactive. But it fails to explain the absence of seismicity in \nIreland or south-west Scotland. Muir Wood (1989) writes that \u201cThe large late \nMiocene\/Pliocene inversion on the north-western edge of Wales is still a nest of \nseismicity\u201d. However, a comparable inversion developed at the same time on the \nsouthern margin of Lough Neagh, and this shows no signs of continued seismicity at \nthe present day. One has to suppose either that the absence of seismicity in \nNorthern Ireland is a temporary phenomenon, or that the presence of late Miocene \ninversion structures is not a good predictor of modern seismicity in the UK. There is \nno strong mechanical explanation for Miocene deformation being a controlling factor \nin modern seismicity (though it seems reasonable to suppose that areas that were \nweakened at that time may continue to be weak), and ultimately this is an \nexplanation that \u201cworks only when it works\u201d. \nIn one of the first studies to attempt a seismic source model for the whole of Britain \nfor the purposes of computing seismic hazard, Ove Arup (1993) used Muir Wood\u2019s \n(1989) outline to define three categories: areas excluded from all four deformation \nphases, areas included in one or two phases, and areas included in more than two \nphases or included in the final phase. It is shown in Musson (2000a) that this model \ndoes not predict contemporary seismicity very accurately. \nTo examine the effects of multiple phases of activation, Figure 13 is provided. Heavy \nshading covers the areas present in three out of four phases, lighter shading \nindicates two out of four (obviously, some allowance should be made for the fact that \nnone of these boundaries are in actuality sharp or well-defined). Nowhere scores four \nout of four, since the phases 1 and 2 do not overlap. The most activated areas are \nCornwall, south Devon-Dorset, Sussex and Skye-Lewis. These are far from being \nnotable for relatively high seismicity today. \nIn fact, there is in general the same problem with combinations of explanatory \nvariables as there is with single ones. To say that seismicity occurs where factor X is \npresent and also factor Y suffers from the same problem that inevitably one finds \nsome places where X and Y are present but there is apparently no seismicity, and \none cannot demonstrate whether this is a temporary exception or a piece of counter-\nevidence. \nGlacial rebound \nThe idea that isostatic recovery following deglaciation might trigger seismicity goes \nback as far as Hobbs (1927) in North America, and Kolderup (1930) proposed this as \nan explanation for seismicity in the northern North Sea. It was invoked by Versey \n(1939) as an explanation for the 7 June 1931 Dogger Bank earthquake, but on no \ngood evidence. \nIt was noted by Musson (1996b) that there is a remarkable correlation between the \ndistribution of seismicity in Scotland and the distribution of ice cover during the last \nglacial advance, the Loch Lomond interstadial, shown in Figure 14 (Dawson 1992, \nBowen et al 2002, Clark et al 2004). Since focal mechanisms in the area show \n 24\npredominantly strike-slip faulting, indicating that the principal stress direction is \nhorizontal, it cannot be argued that isostatic rebound is the driving force behind \nScottish seismicity, but one could hypothesise that the present distribution of \nseismicity in Scotland is a shadow of a former period of enhanced seismicity \nimmediately following deglaciation, when isostatic recovery was much more rapid \nthan it is now. Under this hypothesis, one could argue that structures that were \nreactivated after deglaciation have continued active to the present day, where \noriented favourably with respect to the present stress regime. But while this might \ntentatively explain why seismicity in Scotland is localised chiefly to the west coast \nbetween Dunoon and Ullapool, it does nothing to explain the presence or absence of \nseismicity anywhere else in the UK. \nMuir Wood (2000) extends the concept of deglaciation seismotectonics considerably \nby proposing a pattern of stress interference between radial strain fields due to post-\nglacial rebound and forebulge collapse on the one hand, and the general tectonic \nmaximum horizontal stress on the other. He proposes a pattern of quadrants as \nshown in Figure 15. The inner zone is characterised by radial extensive strain \nassociated with a rising rebound dome, and the outer ring characterised by radial \ncompressive strain associated with a sinking forebulge. In the plane of the maximum \nhorizontal stress direction, owing to the effect of the stress interference on the Mohr-\nCoulomb failure criterion, one expects high seismicity in the outer sector and low \nseismicity in the inner sector. Normal to the maximum horizontal stress direction the \npattern is reversed. \nFigure 16 shows the effect of this in the UK; the zones are adapted from Figure 4 in \nMuir Wood (2000) and overlain on UK seismicity above 4 ML. While the theory is \nattractively ingenious, as Figure 16 shows, it does not match events very well. In the \nfirst instance, it is not clear why the forebulge for a rather small ice sheet should be \nso much larger than the rebound dome, unless it has just been drawn that way to \ntake in all the seismicity of England. Secondly, and rather obviously, what should be \na seismic forebulge to the north-west of Scotland is completely inactive, as Muir \nWood (2000) also notes. Since 1995, seismic instrumentation in the extreme north \nand north-west of Scotland has been greatly upgraded, and since 1999 a network \nhas been operating in the Faroes, and not even microseismicity has been detected in \nthis very quiet area. Thirdly, the aseismic and seismic sectors of the rebound dome in \nScotland don\u2019t really match the actual distribution of epicentres very well, even \nallowing for the fact that the boundaries in Figure 16 can only be approximate. \nMajor fault systems \nIn a wide-ranging study of seismotectonics in the UK, Chadwick et al (1996) \nexamined spatial correlations of a number of geological and geophysical variables \n(gravity anomalies, magnetic anomalies, heat flow, depth to Moho, etc.) with the \ndistribution of British seismicity, in order to look for spatial correlations. In general the \nresults were negative. However, some interesting findings did emerge, notably that \nthere seemed to be a tendency for the larger British earthquakes to occur in the \nfootwall blocks of major fault systems. \nIt has often been the case, since Davison (1924) and earlier papers by Davison \nreferenced therein, that attempts have been made to attribute British earthquakes to \nmajor mapped fault structures. However, the fact that an epicentre falls on the \nsurface trace of a fault does not have the significance that Davison placed on it when \none realises that the fault is dipping, and the earthquake focus is some 15 km below \nthe surface, well away from the actual fault plane. This means that if this co-location \nis significant, it cannot be in terms of a simple thrust-fault reactivation model on major \ndipping structures (these events also have, where they can be determined, fault \nplane solutions indicating strike-slip faulting on near-vertical faults). \n 25\nIf there is a significance, it must be in terms of these major fault systems acting as \ngeneral crustal weaknesses. Thus one can conjecture that a minor north-south strike-\nslip fault is more likely to be reactivated by the regional stress field if it is situated in a \nzone of crustal weakness near a major fault zone than if it occurs in stronger crust \naway from such zones. Thus, returning to the discussion of faulting in connection \nwith the Inverness earthquakes, whichever fault was responsible, it is arguable that \ncrustal weakness due to the presence of the Great Glen Fault zone contributed to the \nreactivation. This idea is supported by the fact that there is a discernible tendency for \nearthquakes to cluster around fault intersections, such as the Iapetus Thrust with the \nPennine Fault, and the Variscan Front Thrust with north-west-trending transcurrent \nfaults (Chadwick et al 1996). Similarly, there are cases where earthquakes seem to \ncluster between converging faults: Moine Thrust and Great Glen Fault, Moine Thrust \nand HBF, Church Stretton Fault and Variscan Front (Chadwick et al 1996). \nIn Figure 17, adapted from Chadwick et al (1996), the proposed corridors around \nmajor crustal faults are shown by the stippled area (not fully extended either west or \neast of Britain). There is a similar problem to what has been seen before; there are \ncases where the seismicity does seem to be associated with these zones of \nweakness, but many places where the crustal faults have no seismicity associated \nwith them. Therefore the presence of major crustal fault structures does not seem to \nbe a good predictor on its own, although it may be a contributive factor. \nIt may be worth remarking that overlaying Figures 13 and 17 is no more illuminating; \nthe problem is that all tectonic hypotheses based either on Palaeogene deformation \nor major crustal structures imply that there should be significant seismicity in eastern \nIreland and the Outer Hebrides, which there simply isn\u2019t. \nA further finding of Chadwick et al (1996) was that a significant positive correlation \nappears to exist between seismicity and areas of Precambrian and Palaeozoic faults, \nand a corresponding negative correlation between seismicity and areas of Mesozoic \nextensional faulting (except in the northern North Sea). This may be due to the fact \nthat reactivation of the moderate to steeply-dipping normal faults of the \nCarboniferous and Mesozoic basins would require a regime of basin inversion, which \ndoes not hold for the UK at the present (Chadwick et al 1996). \nMantle processes \nA recent approach of interest derives from new data that have become available from \nseismic tomographic studies of the upper mantle. It is known that substantial uplift of \nBritain and parts of the adjacent regions took place during the Cenozoic (e.g. Brodie \nand White 1994). Recent studies based on seismic tomography show an \nanomalously hot, low-density region in the underlying lithosphere and asthenosphere \nbeneath Britain, down to at least 200 km (Goes et al 2000). It is suggested by Bott \nand Bott (2004) that this low-density upwelling is the cause of Cenozoic uplift, in \ncontrast to previous theories involving underplating (Cox 1980). \nThe approximate outline of the hot upper-mantle region under Britain is given by \nGoes et al (2000) from both P and S-wave tomography, the former giving a broad \nzone about 200 km wide running from Cornwall to the Solway; the latter a larger area \nincluding  western Scotland and much of the English Midlands. Bott and Bott (2004) \nremark that the combined anomaly zones cover most of the seismicity of mainland \nBritain, a good result considering that the results of Goes et al (2000) are not well \nresolved. Bott and Bott (2004) therefore propose that the distribution of seismicity is \nlinked to the presence of thermally weakened crust and the associated uplift. Further, \nthey suggest that, given the lack of resolution in Goes et al (2000), the distribution of \nseismicity is actually a better indicator of the mantle anomaly than the seismic \ntomography data (Figure 18). This is not an unreasonable position to take, but it \n 26\nreduces again to saying that the predictor variable for seismicity is where \nearthquakes happen to have occurred. \nSince Bott and Bott (2004), a further paper has appeared by Arrowsmith et al (2005), \nwhich presents similar tomographic data of the hot upwelling beneath Britain, but with \nhigher resolution than in Goes et al (2000). This reveals much more structure to the \nmantle anomaly, expressed as P-wave velocity anomalies, which can now be seen to \nextend down as far as 300 km in northern Scotland. Unfortunately it does not confirm \nBott and Bott\u2019s (2004) speculation that the distribution of seismicity is a good guide to \nthe detailed structure of the anomaly. Arrowsmith\u2019s et al (2005) results show in \nparticular that the anomaly extends further to the north and west than shown by Goes \net al (2000) and to be less pronounced in the south, and lacking in much of the \nEnglish Midlands. In fact, they find a good correlation (not entirely unexpected) \nbetween the P-wave velocity anomaly and high gravity anomalies. A simplified plot of \nthe low P-wave velocity anomaly is shown in Figure 19. Arrowsmith et al (2005) \ninterpret the feature as being related to an arm of plume material extending from \nIceland, which, given the increased strength of the anomaly north-west of Scotland, \nseems plausible. \nArrowsmith et al (2005) also assert that there is evidence that the distribution of \nearthquakes in Britain is related to the anomaly, specifically, that earthquakes are \nconcentrated around the edges of the anomaly. One might find some support for this \nin Figure 19 \u2013 except that given the complex shape of the low P-wave velocity area, \nthe amount of the Britain that is approximately \u201cclose\u201d to the edges of the anomaly is \nrather large. One can also plainly see edges of the anomaly with no seismicity. So as \na predictor, this mantle anomaly is not very useful. One can also remark back to the \ngood agreement of the anomaly with gravity data, and recall that gravity anomalies \nwere already studied by Chadwick et al (1996) and found not to give very good \nresults with respect to predicting the distribution of seismicity. \nGeology or geometry? \nOne possible reason for the lack of success in finding some geophysical or \ngeological parameter that can be interpreted as controlling the distribution of \nseismicity in Britain is that the principal control may not be a crustal property at all. \nInstead, it might be necessary to consider the interaction of crustal units from a \ngeometric perspective. \nThe following analogy, while slightly whimsical, and certainly not exact, may be \nuseful. In 1965 a game called Booby Trap was marketed by Parker Bros in North \nAmerica and Waddingtons in the UK. This consisted of a shallow wooden tray, which \ncould be traversed by a wooden bar that extended the width of the tray. This bar was \ncontrolled by a strong spring between the bar and one end of the tray. A rod could be \nused to draw back the bar, compressing the spring; if the rod was released, the bar \nwould be propelled by the spring back down the tray. The playing pieces consisted of \na large number of small plastic cylinders of different diameters, with small handles \nattached. At start of play, the bar was pulled back as far as possible, and the tray \nwas filled with the playing pieces, shuffled around randomly. When the bar was \nreleased, the playing pieces were compacted against the far end of the tray, and held \nunder compression by the force of the spring. \nPlay consisted of attempting to remove pieces from the tray without causing the bar \nto move. Players scored more points according to the size of the piece removed, and \nwere penalised if the piece they removed caused a readjustment of the remaining \npieces and the movement of the bar. Although to a cursory inspection it would \nappear that all the pieces were closely wedged together, in fact some of the pieces \nwould form a stable network (stress arches) that took all the stress, the remaining \n 27\npieces being merely infill. The skill of the game lay in recognising which pieces were \n\u201cload-bearing\u201d and which were \u201cinfill\u201d, and removing only the latter. \nThis is not by any means a close analogy of intraplate seismicity, but there are some \npoints in common. The playing tray is in effect a horizontally compressive stress \nregime, containing a number of different physical units (the playing pieces). Similarly, \nthe British Isles is subject to a compressive stress regime from mid-Atlantic \nspreading, and is composed of a number of different geological units of different \nrheological strengths. The overall physical properties of the assemblage of playing \npieces in the tray of the Booby Trap game can be considered as entirely \nhomogeneous, inasmuch as the tray is a regular shape, the base of it is evenly \nsmooth, and so on. Yet in play, marked heterogeneities could develop such that quite \nlarge areas could turn out to be \u201cinfill\u201d \u2013 pieces that were not actually under \nsignificant strain, since the bar was entirely restrained by other pieces. These areas \nacted rather like aseismic regions, since pieces could be removed safely without \ncausing the \u201cearthquake\u201d of the bar moving. What determined the location of these \nareas was entirely the geometric arrangement of the pieces. The chains of \u201cstrong\u201d \npieces formed because of geometrical interactions between them, not because of \nany property of the pieces, or of the gaps (faults) between them. Issues such as \ndifferences in fault strengths are obviously omitted from this analogy, which should \nnot be stretched too far \u2013 its purpose is only to demonstrate the influence of \ngeometric patterns on behaviour under loading. \nOne can imagine that similar interactions could occur in an intraplate area like the \nUK. While a primary division of the British Isles can be made into different terranes \nas shown in Figure 11, there are other distinct blocks that are likely to function as \nunits that \u201cjostle\u201d, to use a term from Chadwick et al (1996). One can cite as an \nexample the structure of the Pennines, where cohesive blocks like the Alston and \nAskrigg Blocks form the backbone of the upland ridge. It is rather notable that in \nSouthern Scotland, which has very little seismicity, repeated small earthquakes occur \nin a restricted area which happens to be directly north of where the Pennine Chain \nmeets the Iapetus suture. It seems probable that these are due to a stress \nconcentration where the Pennines are acting as a rather scaled-down rigid indenter \nimpacting on the Southern Uplands. \nThe concept of a rigid indenter might also be invoked to explain the concentration of \nseismicity at the northern apex of the Midlands Microcraton, and possibly elsewhere. \nFor instance, the 2002 Dudley earthquake (4.7 ML) occurred as a strike-slip event \n(presumably left-lateral) on a roughly north-south fault on the western margin of the \nMidlands Microcraton (Baptie et al 2005), consistent with a slight northward \nmovement of the Midlands Microcraton relative to adjacent blocks. \nThe Pennines and the Midlands Microcraton are examples where such geometric \ninteractions of blocks are relatively straightforward to recognise, but the same \nprinciple may be at work elsewhere, and building up a complete pattern may be an \nimpossible task, since one lacks complete information. A first attempt at this was \nmade by Chadwick et al (1996), and the resulting model is reproduced here as \nFigure 20. In this, incipient relative block kinematics are shown qualitatively by \narrows of different size; areas of relatively higher strain rates are shaded. Chadwick \net al (1996) stress that these movements should be thought of as slight rotational \nreadjustments involving only very small movements \u2013 not systematic displacements. \nThis is not active deformation. \nThe predicted areas of high strain rate in Figure 20 do all coincide with seismic \nactivity, but one would not predict from Figure 20 alone that north-west Wales should \nbe one of the most seismically active parts of Britain. While it seems probable that \nthis seismic activity is associated with the Lleyn Shear Zone, it appears, at least from \n 28\nearthquakes since 1800, that seismicity in north-west Wales is concentrated on the \nflanks of the Snowdonia Massif, and one can speculate that some sort of interaction \nbetween these two features is occurring. A contrary hypothesis would be that \nprevious large earthquakes associated with a north-west Wales source, but which \ncannot be located accurately because of poor macroseismic data, were actually \nstrung out along the Lleyn Shear Zone: this would include the earthquakes of 1690 \nand 1534, and perhaps 1247 also. Since there is no possibility of ever being able to \nlocate these past events more accurately, it seems impossible to resolve the \nquestion other than by waiting a few hundred years for the next large earthquake in \nnorth-west Wales; however, it is worth noting that low-magnitude seismicity does \nappear to be concentrated on the west and north sides of Snowdonia. \nThis model offers a potential explanation of the lack of seismicity in Ireland. Ireland \nbeing near to the passive margin, it could be argued speculatively that there is less \nreason for internal readjustments between crustal blocks in responsive to the \nmaximum compressive stress direction; either due to there being less lateral \nconfinement, or because, in effect, Ireland is in the strain shadow of Great Britain.  \nActive faults in the UK \nSome mention has already been given to cases where earthquakes in the UK have \nbeen attributed to particular faults, and also the relationship between seismicity and \nmajor shear zones. However, the question of determining \u201cactive faults\u201d in the UK is \ncontentious and needs separate discussion. \nAs mentioned, the first attempt to link earthquakes in the UK by naming specific \nfaults as causative features, following the publication of elastic rebound theory by \nReid (1910), was the work of Davison (1924). Davison\u2019s identifications are generally \nnot very well thought out, since he neglects to take into account depth of focus and \n3D fault geometry, and he has a tendency to conclude that any major fault vaguely in \nthe vicinity of an earthquake epicentre must be the causative feature. \nThis set a pattern which one encounters frequently in the literature, especially the \npopular literature, where one finds assertions that such-and-such an earthquake was \ncaused by such-and-such a fault, on no more evidence than that the fault is a \nmapped structure somewhere near the epicentre. No account is made of the \nuncertainty of the epicentral location, the depth of focus, and the possible presence \nof other faults, perhaps with no surface expression, within the volume defined by the \nuncertainty in the location of the earthquake. Sometimes these associations lead to \nmislocations of many tens of kilometres, as in the case of the earthquake of 16 \nAugust 1934, already discussed. \nThere are very few historical earthquakes that one can speculate with any sort of \nconfidence about associations with named, mapped faults. One of these is the \naforementioned 1865 Barrow-in-Furness earthquake, which was extremely shallow, \nand can be very accurately located because of detailed macroseismic data; it is \nhighly likely that it was produced by the Yarlside Fault, near the village of Rampside \n(Musson 1998c). \nThe prospect for associating earthquakes with specific faults becomes much better \nafter the introduction of modern instrumental monitoring, as it is then possible to have \nfocal mechanisms as additional evidence. The first use of this was made by \nAssumpcao (1981), who used focal mechanism data to associate the Kintail \nearthquakes of 1974 with the Strathconon Fault. Even after 1970, few such \nassignments could be proposed. It is stated by Blenkinsop et al (1986) that the 1984 \nFelindre earthquake occurred on a specific fault in the Felindre Basin, south-east of \nNewtown. Redmayne and Musson (1986) suggest that the Loch Long Fault was \nresponsible for the Ardentinny earthquake of 1985. However, in recent years, \n 29\nimprovements in accuracy of location have greatly improved the possible resolution \nof causative fault structures; the 2002 Dudley earthquake can be assigned with some \nconfidence to one of the bounding faults of the South Staffordshire coalfield (Baptie \net al 2005), and the fault responsible for the Manchester swarm of the same year can \nbe imaged, even though it does not correspond to a mapped structure (Baptie and \nOttem\u00f6ller 2004). \nBut are these active faults, as the term is generally understood? The widely used \ndefinition of USEPA (1981) is that any fault that has produced an earthquake in the \nlast 10,000 years is an active fault. This is a profoundly unhelpful definition. How \nmany active faults are there in the UK? From the previous paragraphs one might \nanswer that very few can be identified. But the question is not \u201chow many can be \nidentified?\u201d but \u201chow many are there?\u201d. One can approximate an answer to this \nquestion by looking at a complete seismicity map of the UK (e.g. Figure 9), counting \nthe epicentres and making some allowance for some events sharing the same \nsource: the answer is at least several hundred. Every earthquake in the catalogue \noccurred on some fault or other; the fact that in most cases the causative fault cannot \nbe identified does not stop it existing, or being classed as an active fault according to \nthe USEPA definition (Musson 2005c). \nThis is very dangerous when it comes to seismic hazard assessment. It is often \nassumed to be a requirement in seismic hazard that any active fault requires special \ntreatment in a seismic source model. Thus, typically, any fault that can be identified \nas active according to the USEPA definition is individually modelled, as in Frankel et \nal (1996). This gives rise to the following situation: consider two similar earthquakes, \none of which can be associated with the trace of a known fault, and the other cannot. \nCommon practice would be to treat the first as occurring on an active fault, and the \nother as part of background seismicity. The result would be a concentration of hazard \nnear the first earthquake, while the second event is blurred away over a wide area. \nThis is completely unrealistic, as there is no physical difference between the two \nearthquakes or between the two faults that caused them. The only difference is that \nthe first fault is mapped and the second one isn\u2019t. But \u201cbeing mapped\u201d is not a fault \nproperty that affects its capacity for seismogenesis or its potential contribution to \nhazard. Any practice that results in the \u201cmapped-ness\u201d of a fault having a large \nimpact on the hazard results is rather unsatisfactory. But this is what follows from the \nUSEPA definition. One has a choice: one can model only the known active faults, \nwhich leads to an unreal dichotomy, or one can attempt to invent parameters for \nevery unknown fault for every earthquake in the catalogue, which is obviously a very \nunsatisfactory approach. \nMuch better is to scrap the idea of active faults altogether, and consider instead \n\u201ccontrolling faults\u201d, defined as those faults that are the main expressions of \ncontinuing deformational activity, e.g. graben-bounding faults in areas of present \nextensional tectonics (Musson 2005c). \nIt is now possible to solve the problem by stating that there are no controlling faults in \nthe UK, since there is no continuing active deformation. The reactivation of faults is a \ndifferent process. If we assume, for instance, that the Loch Long Fault was \nresponsible for the 1985 Ardentinny earthquake, this does not imply any necessity for \nthe Loch Long Fault to continue to produce earthquakes in the future; it may do so, \nbut equally, activity may shift onto neighbouring faults. There is no need for the Loch \nLong Fault to continue seismic, unlike, say, the North Anatolian Fault which will \nremain seismically active for millions of years because of its role in interplate motion. \nThus to return to, for example, the Lleyn Shear Zone \u2013 there is no evidence that the \ndipping fault plane of this feature is currently active in any sense of the word. But, as \na result of blocks \u201cjostling\u201d or some other reason, faults in the footwall block are being \n 30\nreactivated. Not just one fault, but evidently several. None of these faults individually \nare controlling faults, but as an assemblage (of an unknown number of faults in total) \nthey are expressive of a process of readjustment or stress relief along the line of the \nLleyn Shear Zone. \nThe same is probably true of other major fault zones such as the Great Glen and \nHighland Boundary Faults. Thus it would be incorrect to state that the Great Glen \nFault is an \u201cactive fault\u201d, but it does appear to act as the locus for an assemblage of \nfaults productive of minor earthquakes, none of which are of uniquely important \nstatus. \nConclusions \nThe seismicity of the UK has often been classified as low-to-moderate. It is not so \nhigh that people generally consider British earthquakes to be a threat, but it is \nsufficient that earthquakes need to be considered in the design of sensitive facilities \nsuch as nuclear power plants. Indeed, it was the British nuclear industry that \nsupported a vast improvement in the understanding of British seismicity during the \n1980s, including both the investigation of historical seismicity and improvements in \ninstrumental monitoring, and the British nuclear industry continues to support \nseismology in the UK through the ODPM-led Customer Group that funds the UK \nseismic network. \nAs a result of this investment, and the various studies the history of which is \nrecounted in Musson (2004a), we know as much about the past earthquake record of \nthe British Isles as we are ever likely to. Despite this, the controlling factors for the \ndistribution of British seismicity remain obscure. The search for simple geological or \ngeophysical parameters to explain the spatial distribution of epicentres has not been \nsuccessful, if regarded impartially. The British Isles is a classic example of intraplate \nseismicity, and it is likely that a complex pattern of fault reactivation related to the 3D \ngeometry of strong and weak crustal blocks and their kinematic interaction is the true \nkey to British seismicity.  \nAcknowledgements \nI would like to express my thanks to all my colleagues in BGS with whom I have had \nthe pleasure of discussing these issues over the years, and especially to Andy \nChadwick.
