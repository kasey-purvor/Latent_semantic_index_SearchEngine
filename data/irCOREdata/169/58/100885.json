Crucially, these\nnanostructured field emitters are flexible, air stable, and produced via a low cost dip-processing\nmethod using an aqueous nanotube ink, whereupon the nanotubes spontaneously assemble onto a\nsurface oxidized carbon fiber matrix to form dense mats. The very low emission threshold is\nrationalized in terms of the morphology of the nanotube mats and the relatively low work function\nof lithium salt derivated carbon nanotubes. \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics.\n\u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2430091\u0004\nCarbon nanotubes \u0001CNTs\u0002 have excellent field emission\n\u0001FE\u0002 properties1\u20134 owing to their high aspect ratio and high\nelectrical conductivity.5 Consequently, CNTs have been ex-\ntensively investigated as cold cathodes for lighting and flat\npanel displays.6\u20138 The realization of low cost, large area\nCNT cathodes is crucial if devices are to become contenders\nin the marketplace and provided the large area driver cir-\ncuitry can also be realized, a winning combination is at\nhand.9 In this letter we report a method for homogeneously\napplying multiwall carbon nanotubes \u0001MWNTs\u0002 over large\nareas onto carbon fiber fabric via solution processing at room\ntemperature. We report a substantial improvement in the field\nemission properties after converting carboxylic acid groups\non the oxidized MWNT surface to the carboxylate salt of\nlithium via facile cation exchange. It is envisaged that this\ntechnique could be scaled up to a roll-to-roll industrial pro-\ncess for producing truly large area, cheap FE substrates with\nexcellent, homogeneous emission properties.\nThe graphitic surface of MWNT renders them hydropho-\nbic and it is notoriously difficult to obtain a stable dispersion\nin common organic solvents without chemical derivatization\nof the outer surface. A simple and common method to form\nstable aqueous dispersions is to reflux MWNT in a concen-\ntrated nitric and sulfuric acid mixture resulting in the forma-\ntion of oxygen containing moieties including carboxylic\nacid groups \u0001\u2013CO\u00b7OH\u0002 attached to the MWNT ends and\nsidewalls.10 Polar oxygen containing moieties such as car-\nboxylic groups readily interact with water molecules via hy-\ndrogen bonding. Functionalization via acid treatment also\nserves to purify MWNTs removing catalytic particles and\namorphous carbon. For the sake of clarity, acid oxidized\nMWNT will herein be referred to as o-MWNT.\nThe work function of materials plays a crucial role in\ntheir field emission properties. From the well-known Fowler-\nNordheim equation,11 it is evident that reducing the work\nfunction should result in an exponential increase in current\ndensity, at a given electric field. Therefore, for cold cathode\napplications it is desirable to minimize the emitter work\nfunction without compromising the cathode stability towards\noxidation. Several groups have attempted to reduce the work\nfunction of CNTs for field emission by coating, intercalation\nwith low work function metals and chemical functionaliza-\ntion, with mixed results.12\u201317 We have recently shown that\nthe work function of acid oxidized MWNT can be dramati-\ncally reduced upon the exchange of protons associated with\nacidic surface groups with alkali metal cations.18 Crucially,\nthis process does not change the MWNT dimensions and\ndoes not compromise the stability of the MWNT.\nHigh purity \u000195%\u0002 MWNTs with a nominal diameter of\n10 nm were purchased from Nanocyl and ultrasonically dis-\npersed in a 3:1 concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid mixture\nfor 10 min. The mixture was refluxed at 110 \u00b0C for 40 min\nbefore diluting with de-ionized water. Large particles and\nagglomerates were removed from the solution by centrifug-\ning. The centrifuged liquid was carefully decanted, filtered\nthrough a 0.2 \u0001m polycarbonate membrane, and washed\nwith de-ionized water until a slurry with pH 6\u20137 was ob-\ntained. This slurry was added to a small amount of de-\nionized water, which was sonicated to disperse the tubes. The\nresulting product was a stable o-MWNT dispersion. The al-\nkali cation exchange \u0003schematically represented in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004\nwas achieved by dispersing 4\u000210\u22124 mol of the metal hy-\ndroxide per milligram of o-MWNT in 2 ml high performance\nliquid chromatography \u0001HPLC\u0002 grade de-ionized water. So-\nlutions were thoroughly mixed in an ultrasonic bath and then\nwashed with pure water until the filtrate was pH neutral,\nensuring the removal of excess LiOH. Herein, lithium treated\no-MWNT will be referred to as Li+MWNT.\nThe as-purchased carbon fiber fabric \u0001Ballard, US\u0002 was\nextremely hydrophobic and initially little or no wetting be-\ntween it and the o-MWNT solution occurred. To render the\ncarbon fiber hydrophilic, it was subject to a microwave oxy-\ngen plasma treatment. The oxygen plasma treatment partially\noxidizes the carbon fiber surface, creating oxygen containing\nmoieties, which enable hydrogen bonding and therefore wet-\nting between the o-MWNT solution and the carbon felt sur-\nface. Additionally, hydrogen bonding will result in strong\nadhesion between the carbon fiber and the o-MWNT layer.\nThe plasma treated carbon felt was dipped in o-MWNT and\nLi+MWNT solutions, removed and baked at 100 \u00b0C for\n20 min to remove residual water.a\u0002Electronic mail: s.lyth@surrey.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 90, 013120 \u00012007\u0002\n0003-6951\/2007\/90\u00021\u0001\/013120\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics90, 013120-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Figure 1\u0001b\u0002 shows the macroscopic mor-\nphology of the carbon fiber fabric made up of individual\ncarbon fibers 7.5 \u0001m in diameter. Figure 1\u0001c\u0002 shows the car-\nbon fiber at a higher magnification. This is compared to the\nsame fiber after oxygen plasma treatment \u0003Fig. 1\u0001d\u0002\u0004 which\nshows evidence of surface damage and inhomogeneity at the\nnanoscale. After o-MWNT coating, individual o-MWNT can\nclearly be seen in Fig. 1\u0001e\u0002 as a uniform layer across the\nwhole carbon fiber surface. Carbon fiber fabric coated in\nLi+MWNT appeared identical to the o-MWNT coated tubes\n\u0001not shown\u0002.\nPristine, plasma treated o-MWNT coated and Li+MWNT\ncoated carbon fiber fabrics were characterized for their FE\nproperties at 10\u22126 mbar in a simple diode configuration. A\n5 mm diameter spherical stainless steel anode was placed\ntypically 4 mm above the substrate. The anode voltage \u0001dc\u0002\nwas incremented in 30 V steps and current readings were\ntaken as an average of 100 measurements obtained once the\nvoltage had stabilized. The macroscopic electric field \u0001E\u0002\nwas calculated by dividing the applied voltage by the elec-\ntrode gap. The threshold field \u0001Eth\u0002 was measured as the\nmacroscopic electric field at which an emission current of\n1 nA was detected. The average Eth was calculated over six\ndifferent emission sites on each sample, with the voltage\ncycled up and down five times at each site. Similar measure-\nments have also been performed on carbon felts onto which\nCNTs were directly grown using plasma based chemical va-\npor deposition.19\nThe FE results are summarized in Fig. 2. Figure 2\u0001a\u0002\nshows the FE current as a function of the applied macro-\nscopic field for the four differently treated carbon fiber fabric\nsamples. Numerical data are summarized in Table I. The\npristine carbon fiber fabric had an Eth of 0.42 V\/\u0001m with a\nhysteresis between the up and down cycles at 1 nA of\n0.20 V\/\u0001m, and a statistical error of \u00b10.03 V\/\u0001m after av-\neraging. After oxygen plasma treatment, Eth is observed to\nrise to 0.58 V\/\u0001m with a larger hysteresis of 0.23 V\/\u0001m\nand larger statistical error of \u00b10.15 V\/\u0001m. This increase in\nEth can be attributed to the increase in the work function of\nthe carbon fiber upon plasma treatment. Ago et al.10 have\npreviously shown that the work function of pristine MWNT\n\u0001\u00054.4 eV\u0002 is close to that of graphite \u0001\u00054.4 eV\u0002 and oxygen\nplasma treatment increases the work function to 4.8 eV.\nSince carbon fibers and MWNT both comprise graphitized\ncarbon, a similar increase in work function of carbon fibers\ncould be expected. Owing to the porous nature of the carbon\nfiber fabric, it was not possible to make a direct measurement\nof the work function using ultraviolet photoelectron spectros-\ncopy. The slight increase in hysteresis and substantial in-\ncrease in error across the sample are indicative of the uneven\netching of the carbon fiber by the plasma oxidization process\n\u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004.\nCoating the plasma treated carbon fiber with o-MWNT\nresults in a decrease in Eth back down to 0.42 V\/\u0001m with\na hysteresis of 0.08 V\/\u0001m, and a statistical error of\n\u00b10.09 V\/\u0001m. This significant reduction in hysteresis, error\nand Eth, is indirect evidence that FE occurs predominantly\nfrom the o-MWNT themselves. The reduction in Eth com-\npared with the plasma treated fiber is attributed to the modi-\nfication of the surface geometry of the fibers by the\no-MWNT, resulting in an overall increase in geometric en-\nhancement and therefore a higher local field at the emitting\nsites. However, since the work function of o-MWNT\n\u00015.0 eV\u0002 \u0001Ref. 18\u0002 is much larger than that of pristine gra-\nphitic carbon fiber \u00014.4 eV\u0002, the beneficial effect of geomet-\nFIG. 1. \u0001a\u0002 Schematic of the cation exchange process.

This im-\nprovement is attributed to the change in work function from\n5.0 to 4.6 eV between the o-MWNT and the Li+MWNT,\nrespectively.18 The statistical error is an indicator of the uni-\nformity of emission across the substrate. In this case, the\nextremely low error suggests that there is a very little varia-\ntion in the emission properties across the entire \u00031 cm2 sub-\nstrate. It should also be noted that the hysteresis for the\nLi+MWNT coated samples is also exceptionally low, indica-\ntive of the stability of the emitter during FE.\nIn summary, carbon fiber fabric was surface oxidized\nand dip coated in o-MWNT and Li+MWNT and the field\nemission properties were investigated. The threshold field\nwas observed to vary depending on the process applied to the\ncarbon fiber fabric, ultimately leading to a substantial reduc-\ntion in threshold field from 0.42 V\/\u0001m for o-MWNT to\n0.25 V\/\u0001m for Li+MWNT. This marked reduction is attrib-\nuted to the reduction in work function from 5.0 to 4.6 eV.\nAn associated decrease in hysteresis and an increase in emis-\nsion uniformity across the sample were also observed \u0001Table\nI\u0002. This method provides a simple, cheap, and scalable way\nof creating high performance, large area, and flexible field\nemitting electrodes.\nThe authors would like to thank EPSRC \u0001UK\u0002 for\nfunding this research via the CBE and Portfolio Partnership\nprogrammes.\n1W.
