INTRODUCTION \n \nIn addition to the well-known high specific \nstrength and stiffness, the use of composite \nmaterials in aircraft design offers many \nadvantages to tackle the dynamic and \naeroelastic problems, such as divergence, \nflutter and gust response. In some of the \npioneering works [1-4], it was found that the \nwarping restraint and elastic coupling have \npositive effect on the divergence speed of \nforward swept laminated composite wings. \nInvestigation into the effect of elastic coupling \non the flutter speed of composite wings has \nalso been carried out as evident from literature \n[5, 6]. Later efforts have been made to \noptimise laminated composite wing structures \nto produce desirable aeroelastic effects [7-10]. \nIt has been found that optimised asymmetric \nlay-up associated with relatively high coupling \nrigidity could be advantageous from an \naeroelastic point of view. Symmetric lay-up \nassociated with low coupling rigidity is \nnormally undesirable for aeroelastic stability \nalthough it has often been employed in real \nlife mainly due to the strength requirement and \nease of manufacture. \n In this paper laminates of both symmetric \nand asymmetric lay-ups with low and \nrelatively high coupling rigidity have been \nexamined for achieving an optimal design of a \ncomposite wing with a maximum flutter speed. \nIn order to ensure an efficient way of \nachieving an optimal lay-up, two optimisation \napproaches have been investigated. In the first \napproach, the flutter speed was set in the \nobjective function directly. In the second \napproach, optimisation was carried out to \nminimise an objective function containing the \n 2\ntorsional and coupling rigidities rather than \nflutter speed. This was subsequently followed \nby a separate optimisation procedure to \nmaximise the flutter speed. It has been noted \nthat the optimal solution depends upon the \ninitial lay-up, optimisation variables and the \noptimisation approach used. The solution for \nan optimised composite wing may not be \nunique although the final flutter speeds and \nlay-ups associated with different combination \nof bending, torsional and coupling rigidities \noften appear to be very close to the optimum. \nBecause of the changes in fibre orientation, the \nrigidities and strength of the wing structure \nmay be changed after the optimisation. An \nincrease of torsional rigidity, which is \ngenerally in favour of flutter speed, is \nnormally associated with a strength reduction \nof laminates. In order to regain the strength of \nthe laminates reduced in the above stage, a \nsecond stage of optimisation was carried out. \nAt this stage, it was chosen to optimise the \ncross sectional geometry of the original wing \nstructure along its span instead of laminate \nthickness [10].  \n For illustrative purposes, a swept-back \nwing with a thin-walled box cross-section \nmade of laminated carbon-epoxy material has \nbeen taken as the demonstration example in \nthis paper. Accurate estimation of rigidity \nvalues of composite thin-walled box structures \nhas been the subject of research for a number \nof investigators in recent years [11-15]. Based \non an asymptotic analysis of two-dimensional \nshell theory, Berdichevsky et al. [14] developed \nthe variational asymptotical theory to derive \nthe governing equations of anisotropic thin-\nwalled beams. Later Armanios and Badir [15] \nextended this theory to the free vibration \nanalysis of anisotropic thin-walled beams. In \nthe present work the method described in Ref. \n[15] is used to determine the stiffness \ncoefficients for thin-walled composite beams. \nThe governing equations of motion in free \nvibration are rewritten in matrix form by using \nthe dynamic stiffness method [16-17]. The \nWittrick-Williams algorithm [18] is used to \ncalculate the wing structural modes for higher \naccuracy and better computational efficiency. \nWith regard to the unsteady aerodynamic \nloading calculations, as required for the flutter \nanalysis, both the strip theory and lifting \nsurface theory [19] have been used \nindependently in order to check and validate \nthe results. The well-known V-g method is \nfinally used as a solution technique in the \nflutter analysis, which for the present problem \nis restricted to the lower range of the air speed. \n \n \n2. STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES AND \nMODAL ANALYSIS \n \n2.1 Stiffness and strength of a composite \nbox beam \nA swept-back composite wing of the planform \nas shown in Fig. 1 has been taken as an \nexample in this paper. The laminated \ncomposite box section shown in Fig. 2 is \nbasically the principal load carrying structure \nof the wing. Other parts forward of the front \nspar and behind the rear spar form part of the \nairfoil shape are assumed to contribute only to \nmass and inertia properties and also for the \ncalculation of aerodynamic forces on the wing. \nThe structural optimisation is therefore, \nlimited to the box section of the wing. In order \nto compare the strength of different laminated \nlay-ups, classical lamination theory and the \nusual limit criterion [20] were employed.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ny\n20o\nelastic axis\nmid-chord\nmass axis\n5.73 m\n 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

Cross-sectional details of the composite wing box  \n \n \n2.2 Modal analysis using the dynamic \nstiffness matrix method \n \nThe primary structure of the wing is idealised \nas a thin-walled laminated composite \ncantilever beam. The governing differential \nequations given by Lottati [6] amongst others \nare used as follows to represent the free \nvibration motion of the cantilever composite \nwing, but with the effect of shear deformation, \nrotatory inertia and warping ignored.  \n \nL\nt\nmX\nt\nhm\ny\nK\ny\nhEI \u2212=\u03a8++\u03a8+ 2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\n4\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03b1   (1) \nM\nt\nI\nt\nhmX\ny\nhK\ny\nGJ =\u03a8++\u2212\u03a8\u2212 2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n2\n2\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03b1\u03b1   (2) \n \nwhere h and \u03a8 are transverse displacement \nand rotation of the wing; m, I\u03b1 and X\u03b1 are \nmass, polar mass moment of inertia per unit \nlength and distance between mass and \ngeometric elastic axes of the wing cross-\nsection, respectively.  \nThe differential equations for each of the \nbeam elements representing the wing are then \nrewritten in matrix form by implementing the \ndynamic stiffness matrix method [17]. The \nWittrick and Williams algorithm [18] is \nsubsequently used to calculate the natural \nfrequencies and mode shapes of the composite \ncantilever wing structure represented by the \nassembly of the beam elements along the \nwingspan.  \n \n \n3. FLUTTER ANALYSIS AND \nOPTIMISATION \n \n3.1 Flutter analysis using the determinant \nand V-g methods \nUsing the normal mode method, the flutter \nequation for an oscillating wing in the range of \nincompressible airflow and subsonic speed can \nbe written in generalised coordinates as: \n \n0}{][\n2\n][][\n2\n)]([\n22\n=\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8ee +\u22c5+\u2212 qQAViDiQAVK IRD \u03c1\u03c9\u03c1\u03c9\n              (3) \n \nwhere [KD(\u03c9)] is a frequency dependent \ndynamic stiffness matrix and [D] the damping \nmatrix of the structure;  [QA]R and [QA]I are \nthe real and imaginary parts of the generalised \n0.05\n0.80 m 0.37 m\n\u03b1\nx\ny\n1.22 m\nfibre orientation\n0.07\n 4\naerodynamic matrix as a function of the \nreduced frequency parameter k=\u03c9b\/V, \nrespectively. \nFor computational efficiency, the V-g \nmethod is used; and for accuracy, the \ndeterminant method is also used as an \nalternative way to calculate the flutter speed \nand frequency. In order to implement the V-g \nmethod, the above flutter equation needs to be \nrewritten in a suitable form so as to present a \nstandard complex eigenvalue problem. This \nprocedure requires the unknown frequency \u03c9 \nto be expressed explicitly in the dynamic \nstiffness matrix. It was thus necessary to \nexpress the dynamic stiffness matrix [KD(\u03c9)] \nin the form of Taylor\u2019s series expansion with \nthe stiffness and mass matrices being separated \nas follows. \n \n  [KD(\u03c9)]=[K]0 - \u03c92[M]0 - \u03c94[M]1 -...

Since the wing weight will \nnot be affected by fibre orientation, an \nunconstrained optimisation problem is \ntherefore formulated and expressed as follows: \n \nminimise  fv(\u03b1)    within {\u03b1l}\u2264 {\u03b1}\u2264 {\u03b1u}      \n(6) \n \nwhere fv(\u03b1) is the objective function and \u03b1 \nrepresents the fibre orientation as design \nvariable with {\u03b1l} and {\u03b1u} being the lower \nand upper bounds. \nIn solving the above optimisation \nproblem, the Davidson-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) \nvariable metric method [21] is used as the \noptimiser whereas the Golden Section method \n[22] based on polynomial interpolation is used \nfor the one-dimensional search. The following \nnon-dimensional objective function is \nformulated to minimise fv(\u03b1), i.e. to maximise \nthe flutter speed: \n \n     2\n0\n0 )\n)(\n)()(\n1()( \u03b1\n\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1\nf\nff\nv V\nVV\nf\n\u2212\u2212=            (7) \n \nwhere Vf(\u03b10) and Vf(\u03b1) represent the flutter \nspeeds of the wing box structure with the \nlaminate fibre orientation \u03b10 in the initial \ndesign and optimised \u03b1, respectively. \nA large amount of computing time will be \ninevitably required in this approach because \nflutter speed need to be calculated repeatedly \nin the whole optimisation procedure. An \nalternative and more efficient approach would \nbe to involve the flutter analysis at a new \nfavourable lay-up rather than from the initial \nlay-up. From the classical theory of \naeroelasticity it is generally known that the \ntorsional rigidity of a wing has relatively \nlarger effect on aeroelastic behaviour than its \nbending rigidity. In addition, it has been found \nfrom previous research [9] that in the \nparticular context of a composite wing the \nbending-torsion coupling rigidity K also has \nsignificant effect on flutter characteristics. \nTherefore an objective function involving the \ntorsional (GJ) and coupling (K) rigidities, is \nformulated as follows (this was used to \nachieve the most favourable lay-up before \nperforming the flutter calculation):  \n   \n      \n)()(\n)()(\n)( 00 \u03b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\u03b1\u03b1\nKGJ\nKGJ\nfv +\n+=            (8) \n \nA minimum value of the above objective \nfunction may not necessarily correspond to a \ndesign that gives the maximum flutter speed. \n 5\nHowever the optimal solution obtained by \nusing equation (8) will no-doubt provide a \nfavourable lay-up that will increase the flutter \nspeed. Starting from such a new lay-up, it is \nexpected that computing time can be \nsignificantly reduced in the subsequent \noptimisation when employing equation (7) and \nthus the overall aeroelastic tailoring would be \nmore efficient.  \n \n3.3 Constrained optimisation for minimum \nstrength reduction (stage-2) \nAs a result of the above stage-1 procedure, the \noptimised wing box normally has a larger \ntorsional rigidity associated with the change in \nfibre orientations. This may cause an increase \nof maximum stress and failure index in the \nlaminates subjected to a force and hence a \nreduction in strength. To this end the \nmaximum stress theory has been applied to the \nlaminate strength analysis. In order to \nminimise the strength reduction, a second \nstage of optimisation has been carried out by \ntaking the cross sectional dimensions of the \nwing box along its span as design variables. \nThe flutter speed was taken as a constraint \ncondition so as to maintain the maximum \nflutter speed achieved in stage-1. The total \nweight of the wing was also considered in the \noptimisation. Instead of creating an additional \nconstraint condition, the weight was combined \ntogether with the stress to create an objective \nfunction fs(c) as presented below. This second \nstage optimisation was carried out by solving \nthe following constrained optimisation \nproblem: \nminimize  ))()1)(((\n2\n1)( 23 cRcRcf Wss +\u2212=  \n  \nsubject to \nmax\nmax)()(\nV\nVcV\ncG f\n\u2212=  \u2265 0  \n \nwithin  {cl}\u2264{c}\u2265{cu}                 (9) \n \nwhere Rs(c)=\u03c31t(c) \/\u03c30 represents a ratio of the \nmaximum tensile stress in fibre direction in the \noptimised laminates against that in the initial \ndesign of the wing box; Rw(c) = W(c)\/ W0  \nrepresents a ratio of weight of the optimised \nwing box against the initial design; Vmax and \nVf(c) represent the maximum flutter speed \nachieved in stage 1 and the optimised flutter \nspeed in stage 2 respectively; {c} represents \nthe cross-section dimensions of the wing box \nalong its span taken as design variables with \nlower and upper bounds, {cl} and {cu} \nrespectively. \nIn stage 2, the constrained optimization \nwas converted into a sequence of un-\nconstrained optimisation problems by using \nthe penalty function method. The Broydon-\nFletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method \nwas used as optimizer and the Golden Section \nmethod was used for one-dimensional search \n[22]. \n \n \n4. EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSION \n \n4.1 Initial laminate lay-up  \nIn the composite wing example shown in \nFig.1, the uniform thin-walled box beam of the \ncross-section as shown in Fig. 2 forms the \nprimary wing structure. The left and right \nsides of the box play the role of the front and \nrear spars while the top and bottom sides \nrepresent the wing skins. In the initial lay-up, \neach side of the box beam is made up of \nsymmetric laminates consisting of eight plies \nwith stacking sequence presented in Table 1 \n(see Fig. 2). This choice was influenced by the \nfact that such lay-ups provide a reasonably \nhigh bending and torsional rigidity and also \ngood combination of laminate strength in all \ndirections for the wing. When taking the fibre \norientations as design variables in this case, \nthe total number of independent design \nvariables for the wing box is 16. Although the \nlaminate on each side is limited to symmetry, \nthe lay-up on different sides could be different \nafter the optimisation and may result in \nasymmetric lay-up for the whole wing box \nsection associated with non-zero coupling \nrigidity. The computed bending, torsional, \ncoupling rigidities and flutter speeds using \nstrip and lifting-surface (L-S) theory \nrespectively, are given in Table 1. \n \n \n4.2 Aeroelastic optimisation by fibre \n      tailoring (stage 1) \n 6\n \n4.2.1 Direct aeroelastic optimisation approach \n \nSymmetric lay-up (case 1). In the first attempt \nat optimisation, fibre orientations on each side \nof the box section were changed together and \nlimited to symmetric lay-up. Hence there were \nonly four design variables involved in the \noptimisation. In this first approach of \noptimisation, the objective function expressed \nin equation (7) was employed directly to \nsearch for the maximum flutter speed. As the \nresult, the bending-torsion coupling rigidity \nremained zero like the initial lay-up and an \noptimal lay-up with maximum flutter speed at \n\u03b1=45 was obtained as shown in Table 1 (see \nresults for case 1).  \n \nAsymmetric lay-up (case 2). It was expected \nthat higher flutter speed could be achieved if \nthe lay-up was not limited to symmetric case. \nTherefore, in the second attempt the \noptimisation was restarted from the initial lay-\nup using equation (7). Without symmetric lay-\nup limitation, four fibre orientations on each \nside of the box section involving a total of 16 \ndesign variables were now used in the \noptimisation. As expected, more computing \ntime was consumed to achieve the final \nsolution. As shown in Table 1 (see results for \ncase 2), the results indicate a different lay-up \nfrom that of the case 1 and give a higher flutter \nspeed. It has been noted that little change \noccurs in the laminates comprising the front \nand rear spars because the flutter is not \nsensitive to their lay-up in this case. \n \nAsymmetric lay-up (case 3). From the previous \ncase 2 results, it has been realised that the \noptimisation efficiency may be improved by \nselecting only those design variables that have \nsignificant effect on flutter speed. In this case \ntherefore, only the fibre orientations in the top \nand bottom skins were taken as design \nvariables in the optimisation. With reduced \ncomputing time an optimal lay-up was \nobtained and shown in the case 3 results of \nTable 1. These results give an alternative \ndesign solution with the lay-up in the front and \nrear spars remaining the same as initial design \nbut the skin lay-up being different from that of \ncase 2. It is also interesting to note that both \nthe torsional and the coupling rigidities and \nalso the achieved flutter speed are slightly \nhigher than those of case 2. \n \n4.2.2 Indirect aeroelastic optimisation  \n         approach \n \nRigidity optimisation (case 4.1).  From the \nabove results, it has been noticed that a \ncombination of relatively large torsional and \ncoupling rigidities may result in a high flutter \nspeed. For further investigation, an alternative \napproach was attempted with the expectation \nof a more efficient optimisation and a better \nsolution. Starting from the initial lay-up, the \nrigidity-based objective function expressed in \nequation (8) was employed first. There were \n16 design variables involved in the \noptimisation without limiting the case to a \nsymmetric lay-up. A stacking sequence with \nthe maximum sum of torsional and coupling \nrigidities for the wing box was obtained and \nlisted in Table 1 (see results for case 4.1). \nSince the optimisation does not involve flutter \ncalculation yet, the computing time was \nsignificantly reduced. For the same reason \nhowever, the maximum flutter speed is yet to \nbe achieved although over 10 percent increase \nof flutter speed against the initial design has so \nfar been obtained. Because all the four sides of \nthe wing box section contribute to the torsional \nand coupling rigidities, all design variables \nhave been changed in this case. Comparing \nthese results with those of case 2 & 3, it is \nclear that a larger coupling rigidity or sum of \ntorsional and coupling rigidities does not \nnecessarily result in a higher flutter speed. The \nmaximum flutter speed must be associated \nwith a more rational combination of the \ntorsional and coupling rigidities than that \npresented in equation (8).  \n \n \n 7\nTable 1.

In order to \nachieve a maximum flutter speed, the \noptimised stacking sequence from above case \n4.1 was then taken as a new starting point for a \ndirect solution of the aeroelastic optimisation \nproblem using equation (7). Taking all 16 \nvariables again, the optimised lay-up and \nflutter results were obtained as shown in Table \n1 (see case 4.2 results). Compared with the \nresults for case 2 where the same objective \nfunction and number of variables were used, \nthe computing time in this indirect \noptimisation approach is significantly less as \nexpected. Similar to the case 2, the stacking \nsequences of the front and rear spar remain \nunchanged because the flutter speed is much \nless sensitive to their lay-up than that of the \nskins. The flutter speed is further increased by \n7.3 percent from that in case 4.1 as can be seen \nin Table 1. As the final result of this approach, \nthe flutter speed is increased by 18 per cent \nfrom the initial design. \n4.3 Effect of stiffness properties on flutter \nspeed \n \nOnce the mass, inertia property and geometry \ndimension of the wing have been determined, \nthe flutter speed largely depends upon the \nbending, torsional and coupling rigidities, \nwhich in turn depend on the laminate lay-up of \nthe wing box. In order to compare the effect of \nbending and torsional rigidities on flutter \n 8\nbehaviour, flutter speeds were also computed \nfor the composite wing box in symmetric lay-\nup with fibre angles varying from 0 to 90 \ndegree. In such symmetric lay-up, the coupling \nrigidity K remains zero and thus has no effect \non the flutter speed. As shown in Figure 3, the \nresults indicate that the flutter speed follows a \ntrend similar to that of the change in the \ntorsional rigidity GJ without significant effect \nfrom bending rigidity EI. When GJ reaches its \nmaximum value, the flutter speed also reaches \nmaximum with its value Vf =182.2 m\/s, which \nis almost triple the value of Vf = 63.2 m\/s at \nminimum GJ. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Rigidity (MNm2) and flutter speed \n(m\/s) variation as laminate plies \nchange symmetrically at a\u00b1  \n \nRegarding the asymmetric lay-up cases, \nresults in Table 1 shows that higher flutter \nspeed can normally be achieved with the \ncontribution of coupling rigidity. To \ninvestigate further the effect of torsional \nrigidity GJ and the coupling rigidity K, flutter \nspeeds were also calculated for a number of \nasymmetric cases listed in Table 1 by taking \nK=0 and GJ =0.61 MNm2 (initial lay-up). As \nshown in Figure 4, the flutter speeds are \nsignificantly reduced in all cases when \ncoupling rigidity K is ignored (i.e. taking \nK=0). The flutter speeds are further reduced \nwhen the torsional rigidity GJ is reduced down \nto its initial lay-up value (GJ=0.61 MNm2). \nTherefore more attention is worth paying to a \ndesirable combination of GJ and K for \nachieving a maximum flutter speed in \nasymmetric lay-ups.  \n During the investigation it has also been \nobserved that lay-ups of some components of \nthe box structure such as the front and rear \nwalls (spars) have obvious effect on the \nrigidities. However they have little effect on \nthe flutter speed of the wing box as shown in \ncase 2 and 4.2. Therefore, attention is finally \ndrawn to the effect of starting point for \noptimisation, selection of variables and \napproaches on the optimal lay-up result. In \nterms of flutter and optimisation efficiency, \nthe second approach and the results in case 4.2 \nhave the advantage over others.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

Optimized wing box configuration compared with the initial design \n \n \nin the stage-1 result of Table 2. This raises the \nconcern on the strength of the optimised wing \nstructure. Therefore, in the 2nd stage of \noptimisation effort was made to minimise the \nstrength reduction and weight of the wing box \nby carrying out the constrained optimisation \ndescribed in section 3.3. \nThe solution shown for case 4.2 in Table 1 \nwas chosen as the final aeroelastic tailoring \nresult from stage-1. In the second stage, the \nconstrained optimisation problem presented in \nequation (9) was solved. The wing structure \nwas also divided into 10 beam elements \n(sections) spanwise to calculate the flutter \nspeed and maximum stress in the laminates of \neach section. In the optimisation, the depth to \nwidth ratio of the sections in the spanwise \ndirection was kept the same as the initial \ndesign so that only 10 design variables (wing \nbox width) were involved. As the results \nshown in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig. 5 \ndemonstrate, the wing box has been optimised \nfrom the initial uniform configuration to a \ntapered configuration. The change in stress \nratio Rs from 2.38 to 1.0 indicates that the \nmaximum tensile stress in the laminates, \nwhich has been increased in stage 1, has been \nreduced to the same level as the initial design. \nThe change in weight ratio Rw from 1.0 to 0.87 \nindicates that the total weight of the wing box \nhas been reduced by 13 percent from its initial \ndesign. The unchanged flutter ratio Rv \nindicates that the maximum flutter speed \nachieved in stage 1 has not been compromised \nin stage 2 constrained optimization. \n \n \n 5. CONCLUSIONS \n \nA detailed investigation has been carried out \non the aeroelastic optimisation and the effect \nof rigidities on flutter speed of a composite \nwing box. It has been demonstrated that by \noptimizing the fibre orientations a maximum \nflutter speed can be achieved without any \nweight penalty. This is a great advantage of \nlaminated composite structure over its metallic \ncounterpart in aeroelastic tailoring. Following \nconclusions may be drawn: \n1. In comparison with the symmetric lay-up \nof a laminate wing box, the asymmetric \nlay-up is favoured for aeroelastic \noptimisation because of the contribution \nfrom bending-torsion coupling rigidity.  \n2. In comparison with the bending rigidity, \nboth the torsional and the coupling \nrigidities have much more significant \neffect on the flutter speed of a composite \nwing. The torsional rigidity plays a \nrelatively more dominant role in \naeroelastic tailoring. No clear trend of the \ncoupling rigidity effect on the flutter speed \n5.73 \nz \ny \nx \ninboard \ninitial \noptimised wing  0.97 \n0.073 \n 10\ncan be drawn from this investigation. A \ndesirable combination of relatively large \ntorsional and coupling rigidities would \nfavour the flutter speed.  \n3. The solution of optimal lay-up is \ndependent on the initial lay-up, design \nvariables and optimisation approach and \nthus is not unique.  \n4. The lay-ups of some structural \ncomponents may have significant effect on \nthe structural rigidities, but may have little \neffect on flutter behaviour. A careful \nselection of initial lay-up and\/or design \nvariables may improve the optimisation \nefficiency. \n5. An unconstrained aeroelastic optimization \nfor maximum flutter speed might reduce \nthe laminate strength of a composite wing \nstructure. The strength set in the initial \ndesign can be regained without \ncompromising the maximum flutter speed \nand the weight by optimizing the wing \nstructure in a constrained optimization.  \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
