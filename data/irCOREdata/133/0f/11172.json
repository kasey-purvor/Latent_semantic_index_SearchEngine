At higher latitudes the most important contributor\nfor NO density increases is energetic electron precipitation. The electron energy is\nestimated in two ways, from auroral ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray measurements obtained\nfrom Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) and Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging Experiment (PIXIE)\non board the Polar satellite and from ground magnetometer measurements. For the\ntime intervals when the Polar satellite was not above the northern hemisphere, a\nparameterization of the electron energy flux from ground magnetic measurements was\nused. This parameterization was based on data from the SuperMAG database compared to\nUVI\/PIXIE derived electron energy fluxes. The negative perturbation in the northward\nground magnetic component is found to be linearly related to the precipitating\nelectron energy flux. The 4-day period studied is from 30 April (day 120) until 4 May\n1998, where the onset of a geomagnetic storm occurred 2 May (day 122). The results of\nthe comparisons show an overall larger modeled nitric oxide density at auroral\nlatitudes than what was measured by SNOE. The largest discrepancies were for the day of\nthe storm onset, when the background atmosphere was more distorted by Joule\nheating. The next day the agreement between the model and the observations was far\nbetter, which might be due to less amount of Joule heating this day.\nCitation: S\u00e6tre, C., C. A. Barth, J.

Introduction\n[2] Nitric oxide is an important constituent of the upper\natmosphere with important properties for radiative cooling\nand chemical reactions. Since its lifetime in the thermo-\nsphere is about 1 day under sunlit conditions, nitric oxide\nmay be used as a tracer of atmospheric motions. There are\npredictions and observations showing that thermospheric\nNO can be transported to lower altitudes within a strong\npolar vortex and react with ozone in the stratosphere [e.g.,\nSolomon et al., 1982; Randall et al., 2005, 2006].\n[3] Precipitating energetic particles cause dissociation,\nionization, and excitation of the upper atmospheric mole-\ncules and atoms. Excited nitrogen atoms, N(2D), react with\nmolecular oxygen to produce NO. The maximum density of\nNO is in the lower thermosphere, around 110 km altitude.\nNO is mainly destroyed by photodissociation from solar far\nultraviolet radiation, and the subsequent reaction with\nground state nitrogen atoms, N(4S). Photoelectrons pro-\nduced from solar soft X rays and extreme ultraviolet\nradiation (EUV) increase the NO at all latitudes where\nsunlight is present. The NO density in the lower thermo-\nsphere therefore varies with the time of day, the solar\nradiation, and the auroral particle precipitation. At higher\nlatitudes, auroral precipitation dominates the production of\nNO.\n[4] Siskind et al. [1989b] investigated the variation of\nthermospheric nitric oxide during an auroral storm at low\nand middle latitudes, where the effect of Joule heating and\nsolar soft X rays were dominant for the production of NO.\nIn a companion paper, Siskind et al. [1989a] analyzed the\nresponse of NO to auroral particle precipitation during an\nauroral storm using a time-dependent photochemical NOx\nmodel based on the work of Cleary [1986]. The history of\nthe particle precipitation including the characteristic energy\nand energy flux was used as input to the model. These\nparameters for specific geographic locations were derived\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, A08306, doi:10.1029\/2006JA012203, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Physics and Technology, University of Bergen, Bergen,\nNorway.\n2Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of\nColorado, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\n3Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Poly-\ntechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA.\n4Center for Space Plasma and Aeronomic Research, University of\nAlabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama, USA.\n5Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Mary-\nland, USA.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2006JA012203$09.00\nA08306 1 of 11\nfrom an empirical model of global precipitation patterns\nconstructed from the Television Infrared Observation Satel-\nlite (TIROS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-\nministration (NOAA) auroral particle observations [Foster\net al., 1986; Fuller-Rowell and Evans, 1987].\n[5] A revised version of the NOx model was run with\nsolar soft X-ray measurements from the Student Nitric\nOxide Explorer (SNOE) as input for the calculation of the\nphotoelectron flux to determine the NO density at lower\nlatitudes [Barth and Bailey, 2004]. Comparison of the\nmodel results with the NO measured from SNOE showed\nremarkable agreement at latitudes equatorward of 30\u0001 north\nand south. The photochemical model has also been used to\nderive the precipitation electron energy flux from NO\nmeasurements by SNOE. S\u00e6tre et al. [2006] compared the\nenergy deposition from thermospheric NO measurements\nwith that derived from time-integrated X-ray bremsstrah-\nlung measurements from Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging\nExperiment (PIXIE). This study found that at higher lat-\nitudes the NOx photochemical model underestimated the\nenergy deposition compared to the PIXIE measurements.\n[6] In the present work, we calculate the NO density at\nhigher latitudes using the NOx model with both photoelec-\ntron and auroral electron energy input. The auroral electron\nenergy flux and characteristic energy are derived not only\nfrom PIXIE measurements as in the work of S\u00e6tre et al.\n[2006] but also from Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) measure-\nments for the energy range 1 keV to 100 keV. Both UVI and\nPIXIE on the Polar spacecraft had a global view of the\nnorthern auroral oval for \u000110 consecutive hours out of each\n\u000118 hour orbit. Since the NO has a lifetime of \u00011 day in\nsunlight, the auroral electron energy input for the NOx\nmodel needs to be known continuously throughout an event.\nFor the time intervals without UVI and PIXIE measure-\nments, we use a parameterization of the electron energy flux\nbased on ground magnetometer measurements.\n2. Instruments and Methods\n2.1. SNOE NO Observations\n[7] Thermospheric nitric oxide was measured using the\ntechnique of limb-viewing ultraviolet spectroscopy from a\npolar orbiting satellite. The characteristics of the satellite\norbit and the instrument are described by Barth et al.\n[2003]. The SNOE spacecraft was in a Sun-synchronous\norbit with the ascending node at 1030 solar local time\n(SLT). The nitric oxide was measured along the track of\nthe satellite by observing the fluorescent scattering of solar\nradiation from the nitric oxide (0,1) gamma band at 237 nm.\nThe density of nitric oxide was determined using the g-factor\ncalculated by Stevens [1995] and an inversion of column\nemission rates to volume densities as described by Barth et\nal. [2003]. The spinning motion of the spacecraft was used\nto obtain an altitude profile of nitric oxide between 97 and\n150 km with an altitude resolution of 3.3 km and a latitude\nspacing of 5\u0001. The 15 orbits a day were spaced 24\u0001 of\nlongitude apart from each other with a time spacing of\n96 min.\n2.2. NOx Model\n[8] The model for nitric oxide chemistry used in this\nstudy is a revised version of a photochemical model\n[Cleary, 1986; Siskind et al., 1989b, 1989a; Barth, 1992]\nwith updated reaction rates and branching ratios [Bailey et al.,\n2002]. The model is time-dependent and one-dimensional.\nIt includes vertical transport of N(4S) and NO by eddy and\nmolecular diffusion. This electron transport is calculated\nusing the glow model of Solomon et al. [1988] and Solomon\nand Abreu [1989] which includes the energetic electron\ntransport [Banks and Nagy, 1970] for both photoelectrons\nand auroral electrons. The NOx model uses photochemical\nequilibrium to calculate the vertical profiles of NO, N(4S),\nN(2D), NO+, O2\n+, N2\n+, O+, and O+(2D). The extreme ultra-\nviolet solar flux (20\u2013103 nm) is calculated from the model\nof Hinteregger et al. [1981], with the 10.7 cm solar radio\nflux as a proxy for the EUV solar activity. The solar soft\nX-ray irradiance used in the NOx model was measured by\nSNOE [Bailey et al., 2000]. The photoelectron fluxes used\nin the model are found to correspond well with measured\nfluxes [Solomon et al., 2001]. Modeled nitric oxide densi-\nties at lower latitudes produced from energetic photoelec-\ntrons are found to be in good agreement with measured\ndensities [Barth and Bailey, 2004]. The model for the\nbackground neutral atmosphere is the NRL Mass Spec-\ntrometer, Incoherent Scatter radar Extended model,\nNRLMSISE-00 [Picone et al., 2002], where daily values\nof the 10.7 nm solar flux and the 3 hour Ap geomagnetic\nindex are used as proxies for the solar and geomagnetic\nactivity, respectively. The MSIS models are based on a\nhydrostatic model of Bates [1959].\n[9] The N2 ionization rate responds directly to the pre-\ncipitating electron energy input. The NO density increase is\nan accumulated response of the increased ionization and\ndissociation. The amount of NO also varies throughout the\nday as a function of insolation. However, this effect is\nminimal compared to the response of the auroral electron\nenergy input at higher latitudes.\n[10] The NOx model includes chemical and diffusion loss\nprocesses of NO. Some of these processes transform NO\ninto other odd nitrogen species. Photodissociation of NO\nand the following N(4S) reaction with another NO molecule\nhave the end product N2 and O. The effective lifetime of\nthis process is 19.6 hours [Minschwaner and Siskind, 1993].\n2.3. Electron Precipitation: UVI and PIXIE Auroral\nObservations\n[11] The Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) [Torr et al., 1995] and\nthe Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging Experiment (PIXIE)\n[Imhof et al., 1995] on board the Polar spacecraft measured\nthe auroral signatures of precipitating electrons of ultravio-\nlet emissions and X-ray bremsstrahlung. These measure-\nments provide a global map of the precipitating electrons.\n[12] PIXIE was a pinhole camera observing the X-ray\nbremsstrahlung in the energy range \u00013\u201322 keV. The spatial\nresolution was \u0001700 km above the northern hemisphere,\nwhere Polar had its apogee in 1998. The data processing of\nthe PIXIE measurements is described by \u00d8stgaard et al.\n[1999], and the method for deriving the electron energy\nspectrum from about 5 to 100 keV from the PIXIE data is\ndescribed by \u00d8stgaard et al. [2000, 2001].\n[13] UVI observes ultraviolet emissions in the Lyman-\nBirge-Hopfield (LBH) band. These measurements are sep-\narated in the LBH-short and LBH-long bands. LBH-long\nemissions are proportional to the precipitating electron\nA08306 S\u00c6TRE ET AL.: MODEL NO AT HIGHER LATITUDES\n2 of 11\nA08306\nenergy flux. The difference in absorption by molecular\noxygen of the two LBH bands provides information on the\naverage energy of the precipitating electrons. Owing to the\nwobbling of the pointable pedestal on the Polar satellite,\nthe horizontal resolution of UVI from apogee is degraded\nfrom the nominal value of 35 km to approximately 10 times\nthat value in the direction of the wobble. The horizontal\nresolution perpendicular to the wobble direction is un-\naffected. The method for deriving the average electron\nenergy and the electron energy flux from the UVI measure-\nments is described by Germany et al. [1997, 1998a, 1998b].\nThe energy range for the electron spectrum derived from\nUVI is 0.2\u201325 keV.\n[14] The method of deriving the electron energy spectrum\nfrom these two different observation techniques is described\nby \u00d8stgaard et al. [2001], where the result also has been\ncompared with electron energy spectra from DMSP low-\naltitude satellite measurements. The combined UVI and\nPIXIE measurements provide electron energy spectra for\nthe electron energy range 1\u2013100 keV. Electrons with mean\nenergy around 5 keV deposit most of their energy in the\naltitude region important for NO production (between 100\nand 110 km altitude).\n[15] For this work we used the electron energy spectra as\ninput in the photochemical NOx model. The spectra for\n10 min intervals derived from UVI and PIXIE measure-\nments, were assembled using two parameter Maxwell\nspectra. The electron energy flux and mean energy were\nthen averaged over 1 hour intervals. Thus the hourly\nelectron precipitation parameters put into the NOx model\nwere averaged Maxwellian fits to six combined UVI and\nPIXIE 10 min resolution measurements. There were inter-\nvals of up to \u000110 hours of continuous measurements from\nUVI and PIXIE for the event studied here.\n2.4. Electron Precipitation and Geomagnetic\nPerturbations\n[16] Because of the lack of continuous measurements of\nthe electron precipitation, we aimed for using ground\nmagnetometer observations of the geomagnetic perturba-\ntions as a proxy for the auroral electron energy input. The\nmain purpose was to obtain a map of the energy input from\nelectron precipitation, persistent over several days, for input\nin the NOx photochemical model. The neutral particles are\nnot governed by the magnetic and electric fields. They\ncorotate with the Earth. Hence the coordinate system used\nin this comparison is geographical.\n[17] The geomagnetic disturbances in the north (MAG)\nmagnetic component (DN) at higher latitudes are connected\nto ionospheric currents known as the electrojets. The\nwestward electrojet, giving a negative deflection in DN, is\nrelated to the Hall conductance, which again is connected to\nthe energetic electron precipitation [e.g., Baumjohann and\nKamide, 1984; Ahn et al., 1999; Gjerloev and Hoffmann,\n2001; \u00d8stgaard et al., 2002]. The eastward electrojet is\nthought to be more strongly governed by the electric field\n[Baumjohann and Kamide, 1984; Ahn et al., 1999; Gjerloev\nand Hoffmann, 2001]. Thus for this work we correlate the\nmaximum negative perturbation of the local north magnetic\ncomponent, DN < 0, from the ground-based measurements,\nwith the precipitating electron energy flux derived from\nUVI and PIXIE observations. Previous studies of geomag-\nnetic indices and their connections to electron precipitation\nhave mainly been focused on the global AE indices [e.g.,\nGjerloev and Hoffmann, 2001; \u00d8stgaard et al., 2002]. Here\nwe apply ground magnetometer data from the SuperMAG\ndatabase, which consists of more than 100 stations located\nat higher northern latitudes. The comparisons between DN\nand precipitating electron energy flux were made within\nlongitude sectors of 24\u0001.\n[18] A two parameter Maxwell electron energy spectrum\nis derived from UVI and PIXIE measurements for consec-\nutive 10 min intervals. Then the hourly mean of the electron\nenergy flux averaged over a 20\u0001 latitude band (50\u0001\u201370\u0001N)\naround the auroral oval is compared to the hourly mean of\nthe DN < 0 values for the concurrent longitudinal sector. As\nmentioned above, the DN ground perturbations are\nconnected to the Hall conductivity, which again is related\nto the electron precipitation. The electron energies contrib-\nuting to the Hall conductance are above \u00013 keV. The\nelectron energy flux used in these comparisons is just for\nthe energy range 3\u2013100 keV, the electron precipitation\nassumed to give changes in the DN < 0 ground geomag-\nnetic field.\n[19] The global magnetometer network, SuperMAG, is a\ndata set provided by more than 200 ground magnetometer\nstations [Gjerloev et al., 2004]. This network gives good\nglobal coverage and continuous measurements of the\nground geomagnetic perturbations. The magnetometer data\nhas a common baseline removal technique, the same time\nresolution, and the same coordinate system. In the present\nstudy, only the stations for the northern hemisphere are\nused, in all more than 100 stations. However, there are areas\nlike Siberia where there might only be one or two stations\navailable within a 24\u0001 longitude sector. The DN perturba-\ntions in these sectors for the four events investigated here\nwere more often showing high values at high auroral\nactivity than no deflection. Thus we chose to include all\nlongitude sectors in our comparisons. The stations are\nmainly conveniently located in close proximity to the\nauroral oval. In the sectors where the number of stations\nare few, the stations also have relatively good longitudinal\ncoverage.\n[20] The comparisons for all the 4 days, for all sectors and\nall hours of UVI and PIXIE measurements, are gathered in\none scatterplot, Figure 1. The correlation of the data sets is\n0.75. We assume there is overall no essential electron\nprecipitation when DN = 0. The linear fit of the compar-\nisons is calculated using the least squares method. The\nstandard deviation of the residuals is 1.5 [mW\/m2].\n[21] The comparisons were done for all hours where UVI\nand PIXIE were measuring, also for times and areas with\nlow activity. Areas outside the UVI and PIXIE\u2019s field of\nviews were of course not included. To understand more of\nthe details behind the spreading of the data points in Figure 1,\nwe have plotted the hourly means of the periods withDN < 0\nand the electron energy flux as functions of universal time.\nFigure 2 is an example of a well-correlated high-activity\nevent, 216\u0001\u2013240\u0001E, day 122 of 1998. The black histogram\nis the hourly mean DN < 0 for the region, and the grey\nhistogram is the hourly mean electron energy flux derived\nfrom UVI\/PIXIE. The maximum activity was \u00012 hours\nafter midnight for this sector. Overall, the night sector\nshows a fairly good correlation between the two data sets.\nA08306 S\u00c6TRE ET AL.: MODEL NO AT HIGHER LATITUDES\n3 of 11\nA08306\nSometimes, though, the electron energy flux implies a quite\nlarger activity than the ground magnetometer data. Such an\nexample is shown in Figure 3. There are 14 geomagnetic\nstations for this sector, so one would assume that this was\nsufficient for registering any ionospheric current above the\nregion. Eleven of the stations are, however, part of the\nmagnetometer array at the west coast of Greenland. If the\ncurrents related to the auroral activity were located quite\nsouth of these stations, a much fainter deflection would be\nregistered. A situation where the geomagnetic DN < 0\nperturbations gave relatively larger values than the electron\nenergy flux derived from UVI and PIXIE, is displayed in\nFigure 4, from local time \u00014 (corresponding to 1000 UT in\nFigure 4) and onward. The field of views for UVI and\nPIXIE were quite good for this longitude sector and time\ninterval. The first 5 hours of the event, where the actual\nlongitude interval was in the local midnight to early\nmorning sector, the correlation was exceptionally good.\nOn the nightside the ionospheric current systems are be-\nlieved to be controlled by the Hall conductance [e.g.,\nKamide and Vickrey, 1983; Sugino et al., 2002; Gjerloev\nand Hoffmann, 2001]. In the morning sector, however, the\ncurrents can be more influenced by the electric field\n[Kamide and Kokubun, 1996; Gjerloev and Hoffmann,\n2001]. Thus the relative larger amplitudes of the DN < 0\nperturbations in the later part of the morning sector were\nprobably caused by an increased convectional electric field\nand were not directly related to the electron precipitation\nthrough increased Hall conductance.\n[22] To summarize, the comparisons between hourly\nmean of DN < 0 perturbations from ground magnetometer\ndata and energetic electron energy flux from UVI and PIXIE\nobservations for geographical longitude sectors gave a\ncorrelation of 0.75. We find this result significant and\nconclude that ground DN < 0 perturbations may be used\ntogether with UVI and PIXIE data to provide geographical\nmaps of the energetic electron precipitation which are\ncontinuous in time. The uncertainties of the parameteriza-\nFigure 1.

A charac-\nteristic energy of 4 keV was chosen for use with the energy\nflux derived from the magnetometer data. This is approxi-\nmately the mean characteristic energy calculated from the\nPIXIE and UVI data for the times when that data was\navailable.\n3. Results NOx Model\n[23] The NOx model calculated the nitric oxide density in\n24\u0001 longitude times 5\u0001 latitude boxes. The input parameters\nwere the average auroral electron energy flux and charac-\nteristic energy, for the same geographical areas, in 1 hour\nintervals. The modeled NO density was compared to that\nmeasured by SNOE. The comparisons were done as func-\ntions of universal time, latitude, altitude, and solar local\ntime for specific longitude intervals for each SNOE orbit.\n[24] The event presented here is from day 120 to day 123\nof 1998. Figure 5 gives the Dst and Kp geomagnetic activity\nindices for these days. The onset of the geomagnetic storm\nwas between 0500 and 0600 UT on day 122. In Figure 6 the\nNO density from the model (black curve) and the NO\ndensity from SNOE measurements (blue curve), at 110 km\naltitude, are plotted as functions of universal time from\nday 120 until day 124 of 1998. The four latitude sectors\nbetween 50\u0001N and 70\u0001N are displayed. The time resolution\nfor this plot is \u00011.5 hours (distance between the dots),\nwhich is the time between the SNOE orbits. The location in\nlongitude varies with 24 degrees for each of these time steps\nand the NO density shown is a mixture of temporal and\nspatial changes. Since the SNOE satellite was in a Sun-\nsynchronous orbit, the NO measurements were done at the\nsame local time from one orbit to the next. The plot gives\nthe overall variations in nitric oxide in the lower thermo-\nsphere during the course of the geomagnetic storm. Also\nshown is the total auroral electron energy flux for the\npreceding 16 hours (from 1800 SLT the previous day to\n1000 SLT, the time sector where we assume the main\nelectron precipitation occurred) for the particular regions\ncompared (red histogram). The energy fluxes are derived\ndirectly from UVI\/PIXIE measurements, and for the hours\nwhen UVI\/PIXIE did not cover the northern auroral oval,\nfrom the magnetic perturbation parameterization. Each\ncolumn of the energy flux histogram consists of the sum\nof auroral activity for the particular longitude region for the\nevening, night, and morning hours before the SNOE meas-\nurements for the region.\n[25] The first day of comparisons, 120, the model has not\nhad time to respond to the energy input and we focus on the\ncomparisons for the next 3 days, 121, 122, and 123 of 1998.\nOn day 121 the geomagnetic activity was low. There was,\nhowever, some electron precipitation at latitude bands 50\u2013\n55\u0001N and 55\u201360\u0001N that produced a small increase in the\nobserved nitric oxide density. The NOx model calculation\nmatched this increase very nicely. There was additional\nelectron precipitation at latitude bands 60\u201365\u0001N and 65\u2013\n70\u0001N that caused the NOx model to predict an increase in\nnitric oxide density that was not reflected in the NO\nmeasurements from SNOE.\n[26] The next day, 122, where the onset of the geomag-\nnetic storm occurred \u00010530 UT, there was a rather good\ncorrespondence between the two density profiles prior to the\nstorm. From \u00011200 to 1500 UT for the three most northerly\nsectors, there was a decrease in the measured NO density,\nwhile there was a profound activity measured by UVI and\nPIXIE for these regions. After \u00011500 UT the measured\ndensity increased strongly in accordance with the auroral\nelectron energy input to the model. However, the magnitude\nof the measured NO density was substantially less, by a\nfactor 2\u20134, than the modeled density. During the last hours\nof day 122 and the first hours of day 123, the measured NO\ndensity was actually enhanced while the modeled NO\ndensity decreased. This also occurred the last hours of\nday 123.\n[27] On day 123 there were four orbits during the first\nhalf of the day where there were no SNOE measurements.\nDuring the second half of the day, the agreement between\nthe model calculations and the observations improved. In\nlatitude bands 60\u201365\u0001N and 65\u201370\u0001N, there was a decrease\nin measured NO density compared to the model result\nbetween \u00011330 and 1500 UT. During the following couple\nof hours the measured density increased showing a good\nagreement with the auroral energy observations. When\ninterpreting these changes in nitric oxide as function of\nuniversal time, it is important to remember that the longi-\ntude sectors are not the same from one measurement time to\nanother.\n[28] Figure 7 shows the NO density variations as function\nof solar local time for one of the longitude sectors (276\u0001E)\non day 122 at higher latitudes that experienced a clear\nreduction of the measured NO density. This reduction was\nnot expected, since the UVI and PIXIE data clearly showed\nan input of auroral electron energy for this region, as shown\nby the relatively high N2 auroral ionization rate in Figure 7\n(gray histogram). The corresponding universal time for the\nSNOEmeasurements for this longitude sector was\u00011500UT.\nFigure 7 gives the modeled NO density at 106 km altitude\n(black solid curve) as a function of solar local time. Also\nshown is the measured NO density as squares, one mea-\nsurement for the specific longitude sector for each day. The\nnitric oxide photodissociation rate (dotted line) and the N2\nauroral ionization rate (gray histogram) are both plotted on\nan arbitrary scale. The auroral ionization rate is directly\nFigure 5.

Each of the days, SNOE orbit number 1 between 120\u0001 and 144\u0001E, occurred at \u00010030 UT.\nThe satellite passes then moved westward. The orbit number 6 for longitudes 336\u0001\u2013360\u0001E, was at\n\u00011030 UT. And finally, orbit number 15, 144\u0001\u2013168\u0001E, occurred at \u00012300 UT. The steps between each\norbit was 24\u0001 longitude, in the westward direction.\nA08306 S\u00c6TRE ET AL.: MODEL NO AT HIGHER LATITUDES\n6 of 11\nA08306\nrelated to the input precipitation electron energy flux from\nthe UVI and PIXIE measurements and the SuperMAG\nparameterization. The parameterization was averaged over\nall the four latitude sectors, and hence the hours where UVI\nand PIXIE had no observations, the energy flux was the\nsame for all the latitude sectors. For the example given in\nFigure 7, we see that for the two lowest latitudes there was a\nfairly good agreement between the model and the SNOE\ndata for day 121. The modeled NO density for the next day,\n122, showed a significantly larger increase than the mea-\nsured density. For the two upper latitude sectors the mea-\nsured NO density at 106 km altitude actually decreased\nsubstantially from day 121 to day 122, in spite of the\nobserved auroral activity at these latitudes. For all latitudes\nthere was a clear increase in the measured NO density from\nday 122 to day 123. However, it seems like the model basis\non day 122 was too high compared to the measurements to\ngive a good agreement between the two profiles on day 123\neither. Clearly, something happened on day 122 that strongly\nsuppressed the effect on nitric oxide from auroral electron\nprecipitation.\n[29] Figure 8 gives an example of how the modeled NO\ndensity is larger than the measured NO density for all the\n4 days. The factor between the model result and the\nmeasured density seems to remain the same throughout\nthe entire period. This case is for 204\u0001E, 60\u0001\u201365\u0001N,\ncorresponding to \u00012000 UT for the SNOE measurements.\nUnlike the example given in Figure 7, the SNOE observa-\ntions show a clear increase of the NO density on day 122\ndue to the geomagnetic storm.\n[30] The altitude profiles of the nitric oxide densities for\n228\u0001E for all the four latitude sectors for day 122 (upper)\nand day 123 (lower) of 1998, are shown in Figure 9. The\nuniversal time for the SNOE measurements at this longitude\nwas \u00011800 UT. The modeled nitric oxide density on day\n122 was overall larger than that measured by SNOE. This\nwas especially evident at altitudes above \u0001120 km. The\nauroral electron energy flux used as input for the model was\nnot particularly large for this longitude sector during either\nof these days. We see that on day 122, the model displays\nnone of the structures of the measured NO profile above\n\u0001120 km altitude. The nitric oxide altitude profiles were\nbetter correlated at all altitudes on day 123. A few of the\ncases with the most evident differences between the model\nand the measured NO density for day 123 had a much larger\ndifference the day before (day 122).\n4. Discussion\n[31] The objective for this study was to validate the\ncalculation of lower thermospheric nitric oxide at higher\nlatitudes by a photochemical model [Barth, 1992; Bailey et\nal., 2002]. Previous work with the same model gave good\nagreement with observed nitric oxide densities at low\nlatitudes where the effect of electron impact on the produc-\ntion of nitric oxide is from photoelectrons which are\nproduced by the action of solar soft X rays on molecular\nnitrogen and atomic oxygen.\n[32] The results from this study show that the photochem-\nical model overestimates, to a varying degree, the nitric\nFigure 7.

The work of Siskind et al. [1989a] was\nbased on this same photochemical model and had as input\nfor the auroral electron energy deposition the hemispherical\npower index from the NOAA measurements and a statistical\nmodel for the auroral precipitation pattern. Their model\ncalculations gave a far greater NO density at higher latitudes\nthan that measured by the Solar Mesosphere Explorer\n(SME). From the UVI and PIXIE measurements we get\nthe structure and time history of the electron precipitation,\nwithout having to use a statistical model. Our results show\nthat the model results exceed the SNOE data by a factor of\n2\u20134 for the day of the storm onset (see Figure 9, top). The\ngood correlation for the lower latitudes in the previous study\nby Barth and Bailey [2004], also indicates that the revised\nN(2D) yield provides a more correct estimate of the nitric\noxide production. The results of the present study, are\nsubstantially better for the day after the storm onset (123),\nwhen the atmosphere experienced less heating (see Figure 9,\nbottom). This was also the case for another event, not\npresented here, for days 176 to 178, 1998.\n[33] The discrepancies between the modeled NO density\nand the measurements might in part be due to the electron\nenergy input to the model being wrong. On the basis of the\ngood correlation on lower latitudes [Barth and Bailey,\n2004], we believe that the method for the photoelectrons\nproduced by solar soft X rays and extreme ultraviolet to be\nquite satisfactory also for the higher latitudes. Also for the\nresults in this study, the modeled NO density agreed well\nwith the observations when the auroral electron energy\nFigure 9.

That is, the difference was less than \u000150%.\nThe auroral electron energy input for the model was mainly\nfrom UVI and PIXIE. For continuity of the energy input the\nelectron energy flux was also derived from ground geomag-\nnetic measurements from the SuperMAG database, in the\ntime intervals without UVI and PIXIE measurements. The\nelectron energy parameters were derived from the UVI and\nPIXIE measurements by using two different techniques and\nthen matched together to form one electron energy spec-\ntrum. We consider these results to be a satisfactory measure\nof the mean electron energy deposition into the lower\nthermosphere per hour. This hourly auroral electron energy\ninput for the model was based on (usually) six energy\nspectra derived from UVI and PIXIE measurements. It is\ndifficult to give an exact value for the uncertainty of this\nauroral electron energy flux and characteristic energy. There\nare no signs that they might be systematically overesti-\nmated, according to previous work where this method was\nused [\u00d8stgaard et al., 2000].\n[34] The SuperMAG parameterization was divided in 24\u0001\nlongitude sectors. The linear relation between the energy\nflux derived from UVI and PIXIE measurements and the\nDN < 0 perturbation of the geomagnetic field, had a\ncorrelation of 0.75. There were longitude sectors where\nthe number of magnetometer stations was quite low, espe-\ncially in Siberia. The derived energy flux in these regions\nmight be underestimated. This could be the reason for the\ndifferences in the model NO density and the measured one\non the night (\u00010300 UT) of day 123 and on the evening\n(\u00012100\u20132400 UT) on day 123. Here the SNOE measure-\nments of NO showed an increase, while the modeled density\nwas decreasing. For the regions at hand, the main electron\ninput was derived from magnetometer data, and the sectors\nhad few stations. For the other longitude regions, there were\nno systematic variations of the nitric oxide model results\nwhether the input was from UVI and PIXIE or from the\nmagnetometer data.\n[35] The fixed electron characteristic energy at 4 keV for\nthe SuperMAG parameterization could also cause some\ndiscrepancy. However, the altitude profiles of NO seem to\nbe more governed by the neutral wind transport due to\ntemperature gradients [e.g., Price et al., 1995]. The height\nof the maximum NO density was not particularly different\nfor the modeled and the measured profile. The characteristic\nenergy of the auroral electrons, and hence the altitude of the\nmaximum energy deposition, seemed to be well described\nby both the UVI and PIXIE measurements and the fixed\n4 keV value for the SuperMAG events.\n[36] The nitric oxide densities from SNOE dayglow\nmeasurements had a total uncertainty of about 20% [Barth\nand Bailey, 2004]. When also considering the good results\nbetween the photochemical model calculations and the\nmeasured NO density at low latitudes where photoelectrons\nare the source of the electron impact reactions [Barth and\nBailey, 2004], neither the SNOE NO measurements nor the\nSNOE solar soft X-ray observations should give the large\ndiscrepancies at higher latitudes.\n[37] The differences between the model and the measure-\nments were more dominant on day 122 than on day 123.\nThis was especially evident in the altitude profiles of the\nNO density (Figure 9). One of the main differences between\nthese 2 days was the amount of Joule heating. Figure 10\nshows the amount of Joule heating derived from the\nAssimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics\n(AMIE) procedure for days 122 and 123 [Richmond et al.,\n1992]. On day 122 the overall Joule heating after the onset\nof the geomagnetic storm was larger than on day 123. On\nday 122 the global Joule heating exceeded 300 GW for\nabout 10 hours. This is considered to be a moderate amount\nof heating. On day 123 it was above 300 GW for only\n\u00014 hours in total. During periods of significant Joule\nheating, the atmosphere at auroral latitudes will expand,\nenhancing the neutral winds. The model for the background\natmosphere used here, NRLMSISE-00, is based on the\nBates [1959] description. For periods when there is sub-\nstantial Joule heating this description is not applicable.\nHence the NRLMSISE-00 model will not be sufficient for\nmodeling the correct response of the atmosphere. The\nheating on day 122 was considerable enough that the\natmosphere did not follow the Bates [1959] formulism,\nand the NO observations could therefore not be modeled\ncorrectly by the NOx model with the NRLMSISE-00\nestimation for the background atmosphere. For the lower\nand middle latitudes the atmosphere was not affected to that\nextent by the amount of Joule and particle heating. The\nresults of this study are hence not in conflict with the\nprevious high correlation results for the tropics [Barth and\nBailey, 2004]. The better correlations on day 123 show that\nFigure 10.

Summary and Conclusion\n[38] The auroral electron energy has been derived from\nUVI and PIXIE measurements of auroral UV emissions and\nX-ray bremsstrahlung. For the times when the two instru-\nments were not measuring the northern auroral oval, the\nelectron energy flux was estimated from ground geomag-\nnetic measurements. The auroral electron energy was ar-\nranged in geographical boxes of 5\u0001 latitude and 24\u0001\nlongitude sectors. It was continuous in time over 4 days,\nfrom day 120 until day 124 of 1998. This period covered the\nonset of a geomagnetic storm on the morning of day 122.\nThe auroral electron energy was used as the input to a\nphotochemical model for nitric oxide. The energy input\nfrom photoelectrons was also accounted for. The modeled\nNO density in the lower thermosphere between latitudes 50\u0001\nand 70\u0001N was compared with the NO density measured by\nSNOE for the same geographical area. The model calcu-\nlations show good agreement with the measured NO density\nfor the time prior to the storm onset, that is day 121 and the\nbeginning of day 122. Also on the day after the storm main\nphase, day 123, the comparisons are good. For these time\nintervals the modeled nitric oxide is generally well within a\nfactor of two of the measured density at all altitudes. For\nsome longitude sectors the agreement is very good, as\nshown in the example in Figure 9 for day 123. On the\nday of the storm, day 122, the model calculations were up to\na factor of four larger than the SNOE measurements.\nPrevious comparisons of modeled NO density with auroral\nelectron energy input [Siskind et al., 1989a] with revised\nNO data from the SME satellite [Siskind et al., 1998] also\nshowed a factor 3\u20134 overestimate for the model result at\nhigher latitudes during high auroral activity. The Joule\nheating effects on the background atmosphere, and the\nresulting increase of the neutral winds, were not included\nin the one-dimensional nitric oxide model used here. We\nsuggest that increased transport of NO due to significant\nJoule heating on the day of the storm might cause severe\nloss of NO and thus explain the relatively higher discrep-\nancy between model and observed NO densities for this day.\nThe day after, when the Joule heating was not as severe, the\nagreement between the modeled and measured NO densities\nwas better. The reactions involved in the model, and their\nreaction rates and branching ratios, are probably sufficiently\naccurate to calculate the chemical production and loss of\nnitric oxide in the lower thermosphere. It is, however,\nnecessary to incorporate the transport of the neutral gases,\nespecially for events with significant atmospheric heating.\n[39] To conclude, the photochemical model for NO, with\nNRLMSISE-00 as the model for the background atmo-\nsphere, is unable to calculate precisely the correct NO\ndensity in the lower thermosphere without incorporating\nsignificant transport effects. On the basis of the good\nagreement between the modeled nitric oxide density and\nthe measurements before and after the geomagnetic storm,\nwe believe that the chemical processes of the NOx model\nare a correct description of the nitric oxide production and\nloss in the auroral region.\n[40] Acknowledgments.
