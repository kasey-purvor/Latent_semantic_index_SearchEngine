Introduction \nMicro-injection moulding (\u03bcIM) has evolved during the past decade to be one of the most \nimportant processes for high-volume fabrication of micro-components. Advantages of the process \ninclude replication fidelity, dimensional accuracy and wide variety of processable materials. The rapid \ndevelopments introduced in \u03bcIM made it a very popular choice for high-volume applications, and it is \ncurrently used on a commercial scale for, e.g. some microfluidic applications [1].  \nThe commercial use of the process is, nevertheless, limited to micro-components with relatively \nsimple structures. This is because the current technology level of standard \u03bcIM does not provide the \nability to in-line integration of functional elements, which is an increasing requirement for micro-\ncomponents with relatively complex structures. Therefore, process variants are being developed to \nexpand the capabilities of \u03bcIM beyond simple replication to include, for example, functional \nintegration [2]. \nA developing variant of \u03bcIM is micro-assembly injection moulding (\u03bcAIM), which is a process \nthat allows for the assembly of hybrid micro-structures [3]. Similar to conventional moulding, \u03bcAIM \ncombines different processing aspects, such as movable elements, hard\/soft combinations and hollow \nstructures [4]. The process can involve a combination of different polymers or polymers with other \nmaterials [5,6]. \nCombining polymers with elastomers is a well established process in conventional, macro-scale \ninjection moulding, where the mechanical properties of elastomers (e.g. low tensile strength, high \nelongation at break and range of hardness values) make them suitable for applications such as \ngripping elements, gaskets, insulations and part aesthetics. \nUnlike the case with macro-scale moulding, very little is available in the literature about \u03bcIM of \nelastomers. A single experiment has been reported were thermoplastic polyurethanes were \nmicromoulded as non-hybrid into high-aspect ratio structures [7]. In another paper, TPE was used for \npackaging an injection-moulded microfluidic device [8]. Here, a TPE foil was welded to \nPolypropylene (PP) substrates by post-processing. In these two cases, TPE was either micromoulded \nalone or assembled by post processing, but no prior work exists where micro-overmoulding was done \nwith a TPE. \nThe presented process chain involves the use of a 3-plate mould for overmoulding. Micro-\nmoulding by a 3-plate mould has been reported in one experiment [9,10] to fabricate a \npolyoxymethylene (POM) micro-gear and a polycarbonate (PC) lens array. The micro-gear mould had \na gate diameter of 0.6 mm, whilst the lens component had a gate diameter of 0.3 mm. No prior work \nexists where 3-plate moulds with replaceable inserts where used for micro-over moulding. \nThis paper assesses the feasibility of a process chain for integrating functional structural \nelements in \u03bcIM using a thermoplastic elastomer. A micro-overmoulding process was used to \nmicromould a TPE over a PMMA substrate using a 3-plate mould with replaceable inserts. The case \nstudy used to assess the process chain regards an interconnection system for attaching tubes into a 3-D \nmicrofluidic system. \nInterconnection systems are usually produced by post-processing techniques, such as using \nadhesives or commercially available, usually expensive, ports. The selected case study is an example \nof how direct integration within micromoulding could decrease the time and cost of post-processing \nstep, which can sometimes make up to 80% of the device manufacturing cost [11]. A review is \navailable in the literature about current integration methods of interconnection elements by high-\nvolume polymer replication methods [2]. \n \n \n \n \n2. Experiments \n \n2.1. Case study \nThe case study presented in this paper is a building block in a laminated 3-D microfluidic \ndevice for blood\/plasma separation. It consists of a substrate that has two outlets, one for a cell-rich \nphase and the other for the plasma-rich phase. A detailed description of the device functionality is \navailable in the literature [12]. \nThe original substrate was designed such that tubes are interconnected into outlets by adhesives \nin post-processing steps. A modified design, presented here, integrates an interconnection element by \n\u03bcIM, into which tubes would be directly press-fitted. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the \noriginal and modified designs. \n \nFigure 1. Two substrates with post-processed and integrated interconnection systems \n \n2.2. Part design \nThe interconnection element was fabricated by micro-overmoulding, where TPE was moulded \nover a substrate made of PMMA. Figure 2 shows a half cross-section of the sample. The substrate had \nouter dimensions of 10 mm in diameter and 1 mm in thickness. One interconnect port is fully \ncylindrical along the diameter of the TPE element, whilst the other port is partially cylindrical along \nhalf the diameter. This was done to avoid interference between the mould cavity of partially-\ncylindrical port with the gate cavity which is adjacent to the port. Figure 8, which shows the mould of \nthe TPE component, illustrates that the partial cylindrical groove that corresponds to one of the TPE \nflanges will intersect with the gate opening if the grove is machined as a fully circular cylinder. \n \nPMMA Substrate \nTubes \nAdhesive \nInterconnection \nelement \n Figure 2. Half cross section of the interconnection system \n \nEach port has a wall thickness of 500 \u03bcm and a depth of 1.3 mm, which makes the aspect ratio \n(AR) of the corresponding cavity in the mould equals to 2.6. \nFigure 3 presents a CAD image of the PMMA substrate alone. The part was designed to receive \nthe fluidic sample from the other layers of the device through 400-\u03bcm-diameter channels, which \ndelivered the fluidic samples to the ports, where tubes were connected. \nSome features have been introduced to the surface of the part to allow mechanical interlocking \nwith the overmoulded TPE. They consist of channels of dimensions of 100 \u03bcm width x 200 \u03bcm depth \n(AR = 2). Also, positioning marks were introduced to accurately position the substrate during \novermoulding and restrict possible motion in the mould. \n \nPMMA Substrate \nTPE \nelement \n Figure 3. A CAD drawing of the PMMA substrate \n \n2.3. Mould design \nThe moulding process took place in two stages, the first of which was the moulding of the \nPMMA substrate, whilst the second was the overmoulding of the TPE interconnection element. The \nfirst stage was done with a 2-plate mould, while the second stage was done with a 3-plate mould as \ndetailed in the following sections. \n \n2.3.1. Substrate mould design. The substrate mould consisted of a reconfigurable system, where \nmicro-features were micro-milled in an aluminium insert, whilst the mould body was made of steel. \nThis allowed for more flexibility in mould design and reduced micro-milling time and cost. The other \nside of the 2-plate mould was a flat steel plate. Figure 4 shows a diagram of the insert and figure 5 \nshows an SEM image of the micro-milled insert. \nThe micromilling sequence consisted of a roughening and finishing steps. Cutting tools of \ndifferent diameters were used, the least of which was 100 \u03bcm. All cutting tools were tungsten-carbide, \nflat-end milling cutters. \n \n \n1 mm \nPositioning \nmarks \nOutlet ports \nLocking \nfeatures \n Figure 4.

TPE mould design. The overmoulding design was relatively more complex in that the substrate \nand required features on both sides of the parting surface. A 3-plate mould with a replaceable insert \nwas therefore implemented, where the PMMA substrate was positioned on the moving half of the \nmould, whilst the overmoulding took place on the middle (third) plate. The mould was designed with \ntwo cavities. Figure 6 presents a schematic diagram of the system, where, due to size limitations, only \nthe reconfigurable parts are shown without the surrounding mould body (ejector pins were eliminated \nfrom the figure for simplicity). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMoving plate Middle \n(third) \nplate \nFixed plate \nInsert holder \n(steel) \nMould insert \n(aluminium) \nSubstrate \n(PMMA) \nFunctional \nelement \n(TPE) \nRunners \nP\na\nrt\nin\ng\n l\nin\ne\n 1\n \nP\na\nrt\nin\ng\n l\nin\ne\n 2\n \nCores \nGate \nInjection \ndirection \nInjection \ndirection \nThird-plate \ninsert \n(back side) \nThird-plate \ninsert \n(front side) \nFigure 6. Cross-section of the 3-plate micromould \nIn figure 6, two parting lines define the 3 plates of the mould, namely a moving plate, a fixed \nplate and a middle, third plate. All parts were made from hardened tool steel except for the \nreplaceable aluminium inserts. The third and moving plates were both two-cavity moulds. \nThe third plate was also designed with a replaceable steel insert, where features were produced \nby micro-milling. Due to the required geometry of the interconnection system, two cores were \nrequired for each part to form the cylindrical cavities, where interconnection tubes would be fitted \ninto the port. As shown in figure 6, the four cores protruded beyond parting line 1 into the PMMA \nsubstrate. The standard steel inserts of the third plate had a thickness that made them flush with the \nparting surface (parting line 1). Therefore, the insert was redesigned into two halves, where the front \nhalf is thicker than the rest of the third plate, allowing for the milling of the protruding cores, as \nshown in the figure. \nFigures 7 and 8 show a picture of the moving side and an SEM micrograph of the third-plate \nside of the 3-plate mould, respectively. \n \n \nFigure 7. Moving-plate side of a 3-plate mould: cavities for holding PMMA substrates \n \nEjector pin \nPMMA substrate cavity \n Figure 8. Third plate side of a 3-plate mould \n \nSome features in figure 8 had to be redesigned in terms of their aspect ratios to be machinable \nby standard cutters. The gate holes shown in the figure were done by bespoke cutting tools. The tools \nwere made with extended lengths relative to their cutting diameter to reach the required depth of cut \nwith the required cutting diameter of 300 mm. \n \n2.4. Micromoulding of hybrid components \nThe micro-moulding process was undertaken as two stages. The first was the moulding of the \nPMMA substrates, and the second was the overmoulding of TPE to form the interconnection element. \nA high-flow PMMA grade was used in this experiment (VS-UVT from Altuglas). The TPE was a \nStyrene-Ethylene-Butylene-Styrene (SEBS) copolymer. The grade used (MEGOL SV\/P from API) \nwas selected for its adhesion compatibility with polar polymers, such as PMMA. This particular TPE \ngrade has a tensile strength of 0.015 GPa and elongation at break of 450%. The micro-injection \nmoulding machine was a Battenfeld Microsystems 50 and the micromilling machine was a KERN \nEvo. The following sections present the two stages of the process. \nTable 1 shows the process conditions for the two stages: polymer-melt temperature (Tp), mould \ntemperature (Tm), injection speed (Vi), holding pressure (Ph) and cooling time (tc). \n \nTable 1.

Figure 10 shows a filled \novermoulded structure, where it is noted from figure 10 that there is a misalignment in the y-direction \nby approximately 200 \u03bcm. This misalignment was measured using a measurement software integrated \nto an optical microscope. The misalignment was observed in all the produced parts within a variation \nof \u00b12 \u03bcm. \nPMMA substrate \nTPE element \nGate location \nx \ny \n500 \u03bcm \nAs a preliminary leakage test, the hybrid component was joined to a PMMA substrate with a \nsingle microfluidic channel. The system was tested with water-diluted ink at a number of flow rates \nstarting with 0.32 ml\/min (the flow rate at which plasma separation takes place with diluted blood) up \nto double this value. The corresponding pressure at maximum flow rate was measured using a digital \npressure transducer and was approximately 300 mbar, where no leakage was observed. Some leaked \ndroplets started to appear between the tube and the port at a flow rate of approximately 1.2 ml\/min \nand pressure value of approximately 450 mbar. \nThe leakage was inspected visually using a magnifying device, where a coloured fluid was used \nto detect possible leakage. The tubes used were standard 1\/16\" tubes (approximately 1.6 mm outer \ndiameter and 700 \u03bcm inner diameters). Tubes were manually press-fitted into the rubbery ports, and \nno leakage was observed in the selected flow rate range. Figure 12 shows the testing setup. \n \n \nFigure 12. A leakage test with water-diluted black ink \n \n4. Discussion \nThis paper presented a novel process chain for functional integration in \u03bcIM. The approach was \nbased on micro-overmoulding of TPE using a 3-plate mould with a replaceable insert. The approach \nused depended on developing a hybrid structure that benefited from different polymer properties. \nPMMA was used as a low-shrinkage, rigid and transparent polymer for the microfluidic substrate, \nwhilst TPE was used as a low-tensile-modulus polymer for interconnect fittings. The low tensile \nmodulus gave the polymer the rubbery performance that enabled the ports to mechanically grip the \ntubes without the need of extra adhesive. This rubbery grip made it easy to manually fit the tubes into \nthe ports and, at the same time, prevented leakage from the ports. The process chain involved two \nInput \nOutput \nPMMA \nTPE \nmain steps: mould manufacturing and replication, where the latter was done through two moulding \nstages. \n \n4.1. Mould microfabrication \nConcerning mould manufacturing, micro-milling was used to machine the features of the \nreconfigurable moulds: 2-plate and 3-plate moulds. For the 2-plate mould, figures 5, 7 and 8 showed \nthat micromilling was suitable for producing the required features within specified tolerances using \nroughening and subsequent finishing stages. The micro-milling process used Tungsten-carbide cutters \nwith diameters down to 100 \u03bcm. \nHowever, the figures also show some of the micro-milling limitations, such as irregular surface \nfinishes and burrs, for example figure 5. Burrs can sometimes be reduced, although not completely \neliminated, by controlling the cutting parameters during the finishing stage in micromilling. Another \napproach is to remove burrs by post processing using, for example, ultrasonic wet peening [13]. In \nthis particular experiment, no post processing was used to remove burrs, since their existence did not \naffect the application of the device. \nIn addition to burrs, micro-milling cutters have limitations in terms of their cutting length \nrelative to their diameter. Bespoke cutters with extended cutting lengths were used to machine some \nfeatures to the required depth. \nWhen it comes to mould life expectancy, many factors affect the number of parts that can be \nproduced before the feature-carrying insert needs to be replaced. In injection moulding, the mould life \ncycle depends on different parameters, including mould material, number of cavities, treatment of \ncavity surfaces, type of gate used and dimensional tolerances. Other factors are related to processing \nconditions, such as machine size and applied pressures and temperatures. The polymeric material \nitself affects the mould life cycle as some materials, especially glass-reinforced grades, have inherent \nabrasiveness. In conventional injection moulding, a typical mould life cycle would be in the order of \nmagnitude of 10\n5\n cycles. For micro-injection moulding, where requirements for reproducibility and \ntolerances are relatively stringent, the mould life cycle would expectedly be of fewer cycles, \ndepending on the factors mentioned above. \n \n4.2. Replication by \u03bcIM \nWith regard to replicating the PMMA substrate, figures 9 showed a complete replication of all \nthe substrate features, including the channels that had an aspect ratio of 2. A weld-line could also be \nobserved along the centreline of the features. \nConcerning the micromoulding of TPE, figure 10 shows that TPE completely filled the cavities \naround the cores, leaving the required space for tubes to be fitted as shown in figure 11. This shows \nthe feasibility of using TPEs in micromolding of relatively high-aspect ratio applications. \nFilling high aspect ratios by \u03bcIM is usually affected by the material properties, the geometric \nconfiguration (e.g. gate location) and the process conditions [14]. With regard to material properties, \nit is recommended to select polymers with high melt-flow index (MFI) so that the polymer melt can \neasily flow into micro-sized cavities. The used TPE had an MFI of 3, which is relatively low, because \nmost available elastomer grades had relatively low MFI. \nWith regard to geometric configuration, the design of the mould and the scale of the features \ndid not allow for alternative locations for the gate other than the place shown in figure 8. The \nremaining method to fill the high-aspect-ratio features was to control the process conditions. Previous \nwork showed that increasing melt temperature and injection speed improves filling mould cavities in \n\u03bcIM for different polymers [14-16]. In this experiment, as shown in table 1, the melt temperature of \nthe TPE was 200\u00b0C, 20 degrees above the recommended value by the manufacturer. The injection \nspeed was raised to a relatively high value of 200 mm\/s. These two conditions, combined by a \nrelatively high holding pressure, ensured the complete filling of the cavities. \nThe use of the 3-plate mould offered the advantages of automatic separation of gates and the \nexistence of features on both sides of the mould cavity. \nWith regard to material selection, the TPE element adhered to the PMMA substrate, because \nthe selected TPE grade had adhesion compatibility with polar polymers, such as PMMA. The \nmicrochannels that were replicated into the PMMA substrate provided extra mechanical interlocking \nbetween the TPE element and PMMA. In addition to adhesion compatibility, other aspects should be \nconsidered when selecting polymers for integration by micro-over moulding. For example, it is \nrecommended to use polymers with relatively high melt-flow-index values to assist in filling micro-\nscale cavities. In addition, the thermal properties of the two polymers should be selected such that the \novermoulded material does not affect the features of the substrate polymer. The former should, \ntherefore, have a lower softening temperature than the latter. If the device is intended to be used for a \nbiological application, like the case of this paper, the compatibility of the selected materials with \nbiological applications is essential for the device functionality. Other material properties, such as \noptical transparency, resistance to UV light, etc. might also put limitations on the selected materials. \nA unidirectional shift of approximately 200 \u03bcm was, however, observed between the PMMA \nand the TPE layer. This repeated unidirectional shift in the produced parts indicates the existence of a \nmisalignment between the moving plate and the third plate. This misalignment is associated with the \nwear of some of the dowel pins that are responsible for aligning the two mould plates together. The \nwear in the dowel pens results in gaps around the pins that affects the alignment accuracy. The shift in \nthe resulting hybrid structure did not affect the functionality in this particular case, since it did not \nblock the microfluidic channels. However, for application with tighter tolerances, further positioning \ncalibration would be required between the mating plates of the mould by, for example, replacing the \nworn dowel pins. \nIn addition to mould positioning, two areas of improvement would be useful to achieve a well \nestablished process. Firstly, the runner system should be redesigned to decrease its volume relative to \nthe parts. Figure 13 shows the relative size of the runner system with respect to the replicated parts. \nThis is a typical challenge in \u03bcIM, where runners consume a large volume fraction of processed \nmaterial per shot. Another alternative would be to increase the number of cavities in the mould to \nproduce more parts per shot. \n \n \nFigure 13. Runner systems compared to replicated parts \n \nInitial leakage tests were conducted using water-diluted ink, where no leakage was observed in \nthe flow rate range between 0.32 and 0.62 ml\/min, which is the range at which blood\/plasma \nseparation takes place. This corresponded to a pressure of approximately 300 mbar. This indicated \nthat the TPE ports were efficiently gripping the tubes up to approximately 450 mbar, when leakage \nstarted to appear. \nA mass-manufacturing consideration of the presented process chain is the ability to automate \nthe process, such that 2-component integration is done in a single stage. One approach to automation \nis the use of two-component machines, commonly used in conventional moulding. Two-component \nmicro-injection moulding machines have been recently introduced into the market, such as \nFormicaPlast 2K from DESMA [17].  \n \n5. Conclusion \nThis paper presented a process chain for integrating functional elements by micro-\novermoulding. A hybrid structure was produced by micro-moulding TPE over PMMA to produce \nintegrated interconnection ports. The process chain was based on using micromilling for producing \nmicro-structured replaceable moulds, followed by replication with \u03bcIM. A 2-plate mould was used for \nproducing the PMMA substrate using a reconfigurable aluminium insert. A 3-plate mould with a \nreplaceable insert was used to mould TPE over the PMMA substrate. The required cavities (AR of \n2.6) for tube fittings were successfully produced. A shift of about 200 \u03bcm was detected due to mould-\nhalves misalignment. This did not affect the functionality of the system since it was within acceptable \ntolerance. A leakage test showed that the system was leak-proof within a range of flow rates between \n0.32 and 0.62 ml\/min. \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Attia UM, Marson S, Alcock JR.
