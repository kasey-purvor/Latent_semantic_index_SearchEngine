INTRODUCTION \nThe process of cornea1 epithelial wound healing involves a combina- \ntion of cell migration, cell-to-substrate adhesion and cell mitosis. Imme- \ndiately after wounding there is a lag phase, during which the cells \nadjacent to the wound edge undergo a phenotypic change with the loss \nof surface microvilli and appearance of lamellipodia indicating their \nMATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES 124:127-147 (1994) \nOElsevier Science Inc., 1994 \n127 \n655 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10010 00255564\/94\/$7.00 \n128 PAUL D. DALE ET AL. \nimpending motion. The epithelial cells then migrate into the area of \ndefect and increased mitotic activity is observed at the wound margin. \nThese proliferating cells appear to push the whole epithelium towards \nthe center of the wound, resulting in an epithelial plug, which gradually \nregresses to give epithelial continuity [3, 7, 161. In a normal cornea1 \nwound the linear healing rate is approximately 60 pm h-\u2019 and is largely \nindependent of wound size [91. \nWe use cornea1 wound healing as a prototype for the general process \nof epithelial wound healing because there is a large quantity of specific \ndata readily available. Furthermore, the processes involved in cornea1 \nwound healing are of particular clinical significance for the keratectomy \noperation. This operation involves surgical removal of a fibrovascular \ngrowth that is causing abnormality of cornea1 curvature [14]. A key \naspect of this operation is the final curvature of the cornea1 surface, and \nthis has been investigated in the kinematic model of Kwok [17]. Our \napproach concentrates on the underlying cell biology, rather than on \nsuch detailed geometric considerations. \nIn this paper, we focus on the stimulus for increased mitotic and \nmigratory activity. Although the absence of contact inhibition and the \nchange in cell shape are both important, we concentrate on the role of \nthe chemical regulator epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF is a large \nprotein whose receptor is expressed abundantly on epithelial cells. For a \ngeneral wound topical application of EGF has been shown to stimulate \nre-epithelialization in a dosage-dependent manner [21]. Moreover, al- \nthough a number of different growth factors play overlapping and \nsynergetic roles during wound healing, most studies suggest that the \nEGF family is the main regulator of epithelial repair [19]. For this \nreason, we focus here on the role of EGF as an agent promoting wound \nhealing. Some aspects of this work have been briefly presented else- \nwhere [ 101. \nThe source of growth factors in healing wounds is an area of recent \nbiological controversy. In the case of the cornea, it is known that EGF is \npresent in the tear film [22], which overlies the epithelium. Here we \ndevelop a theoretical model whose solutions suggest that the EGF in \nthe tear film alone is insufficient to account for the experimentally \nobserved healing rate. We go on to consider the possibility that the \nexposed underlying tissue within the wound acts as an additional source \nof growth factor. \n2. MODEL EQUATIONS \nWe propose a reaction-diffusion model to investigate the relative \nimportance of the stimulatory affects of EGF on migration and cell \nCORNEAL EPITHELIAL WOUND HEALING \ndivision. The governing equations are of the form: \nRate of Increase Cell \nof Cell Density = Migration \u2019 \nMitotic = Natural \nGeneration Loss \n129 \nRate of Increase = Diffusion + Production Decay of \nof EGF Cont. by Cells - Active EGF . \nWe model cell movement by Fickian diffusion to capture cells \nmoving down gradients in cell density due to contact inhibition, and we \nassume that the cell diffusion coefficient increases linearly with the \nEGF concentration. We take the EGF diffusion coefficient to be a \npositive constant D,. Following a number of previous authors, we use a \nlogistic growth form for the cell mitotic term [18, 261 and represent the \nchemical control of mitosis by an increasing function s(c), where c(r, t) \nis the EGF concentration at position r and time t. Sloughing of the \noutermost epidermal cells is responsible for natural cell loss, and we \ntake this to be a first-order process. Decay of active EGF is due to a \ncombination of natural decay and cellular degradation; we assume the \nformer to be first order in c and model the latter by a saturating term \ndenoting the rate of internal degradation of bound EGF receptors. The \nproduction of chemical by the cells is represented by the function f(n), \ndiscussed in more detail below, where n(r, t) is the cell density. \nThese assumptions imply the following model equations: \nwhere D,, V, n,, k, and 6 are all positive constants; the functional \nforms of D,(c), s(c), f(n), and h(c) are discussed below. \nThe thickness of the epidermis is much smaller than the wound \nlength and hence we can treat the epidermis as two dimensional. By \nconsidering a \u201clinear\u201d wound geometry, which models a long \u201cstrip\u201d \nwound, we simplify the spatial domain from three dimensions to only \none. We solve the equations on a semi-infinite domain --tc, I x < L, \nwith 0 5 x < L representing half the initial wound domain, where 0 is \nthe boundary of the epithelium and L is the center of the wound. Since \nthe epithelium does not contract, 0 is a fixed boundary. \nBiologically relevant initial and boundary conditions are \n(1) n(x,O)=c(x,O>=O forO<x<L \n4x,0) = it\u201d, c(x, 0) = cg for --m<x<O \n130 PAUL D. DALE ET AL. \n(2) d-91)= no, cc--,t)=co vtro \nn,(L, t> = c,(L, t) = 0 by symmetry Vt 2 0, \nwhere no and co represent the unwounded levels of cell density and \nEGF concentration, respectively. \nEstimating the parameter values is vitAI to the comparison of model \npredictions with experimental data. Here we briefly discuss our estima- \ntion techniques. \n(1) The cell cycle time is approximately 6.6 days, giving k = \n(log2\/6.6~24) h-\u2019 =6.31x10p3 h-\u2018. \n(2) The concentration of EGF in reflex tears is 4 ng ml-\u2019 [22] and \nthe molecular weight of EGF is 6145 [5], so the unwounded level of \nchemical concentration co is about 6.6 x lo-\u201d M. \n(3) The cornea1 epithelial cell length is approximately 10 pm [14] \nand hence the unwounded level of cell density, n, = (1\/1O-5)3 m3 = lOi \nliter-\u2018. \n(4) In the absence of cellular degradation EGF has a half-life of \napproximately 1 h in vivo [6], so take 6 = log2 h-\u2018. \n(5) To estimate V, we follow Sherratt and Murray [28] and assume \nthat when the chemical concentration c is at its unwounded level co, \nthe net reaction term in the cell conservation equation is of logistic \ngrowth form kn(1 - n\/no>. The rate of cell loss is - kn, so that \ns(c,>n(v - n\/n,>- kn = kn(l- n\/n,>. Therefore v = 2 and s(co) = k. \n(6) Previous modeling experience suggests that the order of magni- \ntude of a dimensional cell diffusion coefficient, in vivo, is about lo-\u2019 \ncm-\u2019 s- \u2019 [20, 261. As a first approximation we assume that the cellular \ndiffusion coefficient increases linearly with EGF concentration and \nconsider the functional form D,(c) = LYC + \/I. We estimate the values of \n(Y and p by matching model solutions with experimental data, within \nthe constraint that (YC~ + p = lop9 cm2 s-l. \n(7) To determine the functional form for the cellular degradation \nterm h(c) we begin by considering the interaction between the chemical \nC, the free receptors on the cell surface R, the bound receptors B and \nthe internalized receptor-chemical complex I, which can be represented \nby \nwhere k,, k,, and ki are positive rate constants. We use the law of mass \naction to derive three ordinary differential equations for c, r, and b (the \nconcentrations of C, R, and B, respectively) and to circumvent the \nCORNEAL EPITHELIAL WOUND HEALING 131 \ncomplexities of receptor recycling we follow Sherratt et al. [29] and \nassume that the total number of receptors is a function of the number \nof bound receptors, specifically R + B = p + yB, where p and y are \npositive constants to be determined. Comparison of the time scales of \nthese processes with cell movement and chemical diffusion shows that \nto a good approximation, the bound receptor density can be assumed to \nbe at its steady-state level [24]. This leads us to look for a function of \nthe form h(c) = PC\/(; + c), where p and c^ are positive constants. \nUsing data for the variation in the number of bound and free receptors \nwith bound receptor density [30] we can estimate y and p which, in \nturngives c^=2x10m9 M and ~=5.75~10-~~ molcellP\u2019 hP\u2019. \n(8) Any functional form for s(c) is subject to the nondimensional \nconstraint s(co) = 1. As a first approximation, we assume that s(c) is \nlinear and use data for the mitotic rate in the absence of any additional \nEGF [6] to estimate s(O) = 6x 10m4. Later we show that s(c) must \nsaturate for large concentrations of EGF to agree with other experi- \nmental data. \n(9) The overlying tear film supplies a constant source of EGF, \nindependent of cell number, and in the simplest model we take f(n) = A, \nwhere A is a constant, evaluated using the condition that n = no, c = co \nis a steady state. We consider a more complex form for f(n) in a later \nrefinement of the model. \nHaving established these parameter values, we nondimensionalize \nthe model by defining the following dimensionless quantities: \nn * = n\/n,, C * = c\/c,, x* =x\/L \nt* = kt, 2\u201d =2\/c,, s*(coc*) =s(c)\/k \nD,* = DC \/kL\u2019, f*(n,n*) =f(n)\/kc,, P* = pno \/kc0 \n6* = 6\/k, D,*(coc*) = D,(c)\/kL\u2019. \nDropping the asterisks for algebraic convenience, we obtain the dimen- \nsionless model \ndn d _=- \ndt dx ( \n(,c+p)~)+(ol,c+Pl)n(2-n)-n (2a) \n-$=o,$+f(n)-fi--fit. (2b) \n132 PAUL D. DALE ET AL. \nThroughout this paper we assume that the wound length 2L is 4 mm, \nwhich gives the following dimensionless parameters: (Y = 0.01, p = 0.1, \nDC = 25, \/_I, = 1.37~ 104, c^ = 3.02, 6 = 110, (Ye = 0.9, and pi = 0.1. \n3. NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS \nThe biological observation of a front of cells moving into the wound \nat constant speed suggests that the model solutions should have a \ntraveling wave form. However, numerical solutions of the model equa- \ntions with f(n) = A, corresponding to no sources of EGF other than the \ntear film, fail to show definite wave fronts as in Figure la. Moreover, \nthe \u201cmodel wound\u201d is far from healed in the experimentally observed \ntime, which is 37 h for a 2-mm wound. We suspected that the absence of \nwave fronts was due to a long transient time for the evolution of a wave \nprofile [2]. To give a clearer perspective on the model solutions, we thus \nsolve the,equations on - 00 < x < 30, subject to initial conditions IZ = c = 0 \nfor x 2 0 and IZ = c = 1 for x < 0, with boundary conditions n( - m, t) = \nc( -m,t) = 1 and IZ, = c, = 0 as x +w. These new end conditions are \nnot directly relevant to the biological problem; rather, they enable us to \nobtain a clearer understanding of mathematical aspects of our model. \nNumerical solutions show that with these amended end conditions, the \nsystem evolves to traveling waves of constant speed and shape in n and \nc as in Figure 2a, but the speed of these traveling waves ( = 20.45 \npm h-i) is much slower than the healing rate of actual cornea1 wounds \n(~60 pm h-r). Th\u2019 is result strongly suggests that there is another \nsource of EGF in the normal healing process, in addition to the tear \nfilm. \nWe thus consider the possibility that the exposed underlying tissue \nwithin the wound releases EGF, which is rapidly degraded by cells at \nthe wound edge. In this scheme, it is the rapidity of the degradation that \nresults in the experimentally observed increase in cell proliferation and \nmotility in a band of cells at the wound edge; the cells in this band \ndegrade the additional chemical, preventing it reaching cells further \nfrom the wound edge. The possibility of the underlying tissue acting as a \nsource of EGF is suggested by the experiments performed on other cell \ntypes by Dunn and Ireland [12] and Barrandon and Green [ll. In \nBarrandon and Green\u2019s experiments, the growth of large keratinocyte \ncolonies was observed in vitro and was found to be dependent on the \noutward migration of the rapidly proliferating cells located in a thin rim \nclose to the colony perimeter. Dunn and Ireland [12] examined the \ngrowth of 3T3 cells in rotating culture dishes and showed that in the \npresence of serum, new growth occurs at the margin of a wound in a \ncell sheet. They found that increased cell division occurs only down- \nCORNEAL EPITHELIAL WOUND HEALING \nx \nY x \nFIG. 1.

Since a serum-derived factor would be carried \nwith the flow, this supports the possibility that a serum-derived factor is \nresponsible for the elevated rate of cell division after wounding. \nFor our amended form of f(n), we look for a function which is \nconstant for low cell densities and decreases linearly to zero for larger \ncell densities, motivated by the above experimental results. We thus \ntake f(n) = A + B(n), where \ni \nu if n < 0.2 \nB(n)= (~(2-52) if0.2In50.4 \n0 if n > 0.4 \nand (T is a positive constant. Consistent results are obtained provided \nB(n) is nonzero only for YE less than about 0.5. We chose the range \n0.2 < n < 0.4 to be specific, but the results are insensitive to any small \nchange in these threshold values. We use the same parameters as \nbefore and fit the model solutions to estimate the source coefficient U. \nNumerical simulations show that we need u to be greater than about \n1000 to obtain traveling waves and to match the experimentally ob- \nserved healing rate we must take u = 4000. Smaller values of (T give \nreduced mitotic activity, reduced wave speed, and loss of \u201ctraveling \nwave\u201d form. \nThe solutions of this amended model have the experimentally ex- \npected form of a front of cells moving into the wound, with an \nassociated wave of EGF as in Figure lb. Moreover, a plot of the mitotic \ngeneration term against space shows a wave moving with the cell front \nand peaking at approximately 14 times the unwounded level, which \nagrees favorably with the experimentally observed increase in mitotic \nrate [lo] as in Figure 3. The results are also qualitatively very similar to \nthose obtained by Winter [31] for the mitotic rate as a function of \ndistance from the wound edge in the healing of epidermal wounds in \ndomestic pigs. Figure lb shows that the wound length is reduced \nsignificantly by the experimentally predicted time, but that healing is \nstill incomplete. However, by extending our domain size, as discussed \npreviously, long-term simulations evolve to fronts of constant shape, \nmoving with a speed ( = 64 pm hP\u20191 that compares favorably with the \nexperimentally predicted healing rate (Figure 2b). Qualitatively similar \nsolutions are obtained when radially symmetric circular geometry is \nused rather than linear geometry. The radially symmetric case is of \ncourse more relevant to applications, but the advantage of the linear \ngeometry is that the solutions can be studied relatively easily as travel- \n136 PAUL D.

The discrepancy between model solutions and experiments \non the finite domain may be explained by noting that experimentalists \nonly monitor the healing time until the wound radius is reduced by \nabout 75% and then extrapolate to obtain the \u201ctotal\u201d healing time. \nHowever, our model is invalid for the final stages of healing, since the \nprocesses involved become more complex, with the re-establishment of \ncell-cell contacts and other remodeling processes as the opposing wound \nfronts meet [7]. Therefore, it is the rate of healing, rather than the exact \nhealing time, that we require our model solutions to capture. A detailed \nstudy of the final stages of the healing process could be a valuable area \nfor both experimental and theoretical research. In the next section we \nfocus on the improved model and verify analytically the agreement \nbetween healing rates in the model and in experiments. \nAn important biological question is the relative importance of mitosis \nversus migration in the healing process. The equations in (2a) are \nstrongly coupled by terms accounting for these processes. We investi- \ngate this by first reducing a! and p in (2a) by two orders of magnitude, \nwhich corresponds to a healing process dominated by mitosis. In this \ncase, the solutions evolve to traveling waves of greater slope as in \nFigure 4a, moving across the wound at a greatly reduced speed of about \n45 pm h-\u2019 for the given parameter values. Similarly, when the mitotic \nCORNEAL EPITHELIAL WOUND HEALING \n=: 0.8- \nx\u2018 \n\u2018E \n2 E 0.6. \nz \n= \n5 0.4- \n0.2- \n(a) 1.2 \n(b) 1.21 \nx \n8 10 12 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 \n1.0 \n0 2 4 6 8 10 \nx x \nFIG. 4.

In both cases, the other parameters are as in Figure 1. Wave \nfronts are still observed but the rate of healing in greatly reduced. \n138 PAUL D. DALE ET AL. \ngeneration term is reduced by one order of magnitude, healing occurs at \na slower rate of about 35 pm h-\u2019 (Figure 4b). Hence, although our \nmodel predicts that wounds can heal in the virtual absence of either \nmitosis or migration, both processes are important for effective wound \nhealing. \nA separate but equally important question concerns the contribution \nof EGF to migration and mitosis. In the derivation of the functional \nform B(n), we evaluated CJ by matching the increase in mitotic rate \nwith experimental data. Hence, EGF has been shown to have an \nenhancing effect on mitosis. The effect on migration can be investigated \nby varying the parameters (Y and p, with the sum CYC,, + p maintained \nat a biologically realistic value of about 10m9 cm2 s-l. Numerical \nsolutions indicate loss of traveling wave fronts if p is very small, \nresulting in a \u201cfill up\u201d mechanism. However, if (Y is very small fronts of \nthe same constant speed and shape are still observed. This suggests that \nthe role of EGF as a regulator of cell mobility is relatively unimportant; \nhowever, EGF is crucial to healing as a mitotic regulator. Hence, to \nsimplify the following analysis, we shall take cy = 0, corresponding to \nconstant cellular diffusion. \n4. THE SPEED OF HEALING \nIn the single Fisher reaction-diffusion equation [15], traveling wave \nsolutions can be investigated by introducing the coordinate z = x - at, \nwhere a is the speed in the positive x direction. This transforms the \nparabolic partial differential equation to a second-order system of \nordinary differential equations. In contrast to excitable systems such as \nthe Fitzhugh-Naguma (FHN) equations, typical cell population models \nsuch as the Fisher equation, whose kinetics have only one stable \nequilibrium, do not determine a particular speed for which traveling \nwave fronts exist. Rather there is a range of possible wave speeds, and \ndetermination of the speed induced by particular initial conditions is of \nvital importance in applications. In the case of the Fisher equation, it is \nwell known that the value of the parameter a at which the eigenvalues \nat the trivial steady state change from complex (stable spiral) to real \n(stable node) determines the speed of the traveling waves which result \nfrom initial conditions with compact support (see [20] for review). The \npartial differential equation solutions discussed above appear to evolve \nrapidly to waves moving with constant speed and shape. Therefore, by \nanalogy, we look for solutions of the form n(x, t) = N(z) and c(x, t) = \nC(z) and investigate the dependence of the wave speed on the model \nparameters by considering the resulting fourth-order system of ordinary \nCORNEAL EPITHELIAL WOUND HEALING \ndifferential equations \n139 \ndN -= \ndz \u2019 \ndC -= \ndz w \ng=+V-s(C)N(2-N)+N) \nThis system has two steady states, wounded (O,(A + B(O))\/6,0,0) and \nunwounded (1, l,O, 01, the stability of which are determined by the roots \n(eigenvalues) of the dispersion relation. The eigenvalues at the wounded \nsteady state satisfy the quartic equation \nwhere \nA4 + PA3 + QA2 + Rh + S = 0, (4) \np=a &+\u2019 \ni 1 c P \nQ=&Ja2- PS - Dc +2Dcs( A\/6)) (5b) \nS= p%, -(l-2,( A+;(O))). \n(5c) \nFor general parameter values, it is unfeasible to determine the eigenval- \nues analytically. However, it is straightforward to calculate the eigenval- \nues and eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix numerically. This shows \nthat as the parameter a is varied, with the other parameters as dis- \ncussed previously the eigenvalues at the wounded steady state changes \ncharacter only once; namely a change from complex to real occurs in \none pair of eigenvalues at a dimensional wave speed of about 68.4 \npm hP\u2019, which is very close to the wave speed observed in numerical \nsolutions of the partial differential equations. This suggests that this \nchange may determine the observed wave speed. \nTo confirm this we use the partial differential equation solutions to \ninvestigate the form of the conjectured heteroclinic connection near the \n140 PAUL D. DALE ET AL. \nwounded steady state. We are looking for solutions of the form n N a,, e AX \nand hence by estimating d(log n)\/& for large x, we can evaluate \nnumerically the rate at which the wave of the partial differential \nequation approaches the wounded steady state. This verifies that the \ntrajectory corresponding to the traveling wave solutions does indeed \napproach the equilibrium point along the eigenvector corresponding to \nthe eigenvalue which bifurcates at a = 68.4 pm h-i as in Figure 5. At \nthis point, there is a change from oscillatory (complex eigenvalues) to \nmonotone (real) convergence, and the former would result in negative \ncell densities which is biologically implausible. Although the figures \nillustrate results for only a single set of parameter values, the method \ncorrectly predicts the wave speed for a wide range of parameter do- \nmains. \nTypical analyses of traveling wave speeds by linearization about the \nleading edge give rise to eigenvalue equations that factorize into two \nquadratic equations 120, 241; the eigenvalues are thus determined easily. \nIn our system, the eigenvalue equation (4) does not factorize in an \nobvious way. However, for biologically realistic parameter values it is \nFIG. 5. The change in d(logn)\/& with x for the wave illustrated in Figure 2b. \nUnder the assumption that n * n,e \u2018k as x -+m, this function should tend to A. Here \nA = -30, which is the real part of the eigenvalue that changes character at the \ncritical wave speed n = 68.4 pm h-\u2018. This verifies our conjecture that the solution \ntrajectory approaches the wounded steady state along the eigenvector whose eigen- \nvalue changes from complex to real at the critical wave speed. The irregular \nappearance of the curve is a true reflection of the approach and does not indicate \nany numerical inaccuracy. The parameter values and method of numerical solutions \nare as in Figure 1. \nCORNEAL EPITHELIAL WOUND HEALING 141 \npossible to determine an approximate solution of the quartic equation \nfor the eigenvalues A and hence derive an analytical expression for the \nwave speed. Crucially, for the parameter values we have derived from \nexperimental data, the coefficients P and R are small compared with Q \nand S. This holds for all biologically realistic values of D, and D,(c). \nSetting the coefficients P and R to zero gives a quadratic equation in \nh2, whose roots are independent of the wave speed a. Substituting these \nroots back into the quartic and looking for a change of the other two \nroots (which do not depend on a to leading order) from complex to real \ngives the following expression for the critical wave speed \n~Dc[ZDcs( q) -DC - SP] . (6) \nThe expression gives wave speeds of 22.4 and 68.3 pm h- \u2019 for the tear \nfilm and improved models, respectively, which compare very well with \nthe numerically evaluated wave speeds of 23 and 68.4 pm h- \u2019 . An \nimportant biological implication of this result is that the rate of healing \nof cornea1 epithelial wounds can be increased by increasing either the \ncell diffusion coefficient or the secretion rate of EGF. However, in- \ncreasing the chemical diffusion coefficient does not have a significant \neffect. \nA few experiments have been carried out to determine the increase \nin the speed of healing when EGF is applied topically to the wound. \nThe limited data indicates that the healing rate saturates at about 45% \ngreater than normal, at an EGF concentration of about 100 pg mll\u2019 \nhP\u2019 [211. We now modify the analytical expression for the wave speed to \npredict the details of this increase in healing rate. Lack of experimental \ninformation led us to initially choose an unbounded, linearly increasing \nmitotic generation function, s(c), which contradicts these experimental \nresults. Our expression (6) for the speed of healing enables us to use \nexperimental data to derive a more realistic form for s(c). We require \ns(c) to be approximately linear for small c, to saturate for large c, and \nto satisfy the condition s(l) = 1. A simple example of such a function is \ns(c) = (1 + m)c\/(m + c>, where m is a constant. In vivo experiments in \nwhich EGF was applied externally to a cornea1 surface wound indicate a \ndimensionless saturating level of 135 and hence we take m = 134, giving \n135c \ns(c) =134_tc. \nTo model the topical application experiments, we amend our model by \ntaking f(n) = A + B(n) + q, where q is an external source term repre- \n142 PAUL D. DALE ET AL. \nsenting the topical application of EGF. Numerical simulations again \nevolve to traveling waves, the speed of which increases as we increase \nthe external source term. The analytical expression for the wave speed \nis modified accordingly, with A + v replaced by A + u + q. Figure 6 \nshows the very good agreement between the numerically simulated and \nanalytically derived speeds. Hence, we can predict the speed of healing \nof cornea1 surface wounds with topical application of any concentration \nof EGF. This result could easily be tested by further experiments. \n5. THE WAVE FORM \nThe production and decay of EGF occur on a considerably faster \ntime scale than chemical diffusion. This suggests that we may be able to \nderive an analytical approximation for the functional form of the wave \nfronts by assuming that the derivative terms in the EGF equation are \nnegligible compared to the reaction terms. This leads to a reduced \nmodel consisting of a single partial differential equation \ndn -= \nat p dX2 d2n +g(n), \nwhere \ng(n) =w[ (A-pn-6~)+~(pn+6c^-A)2+4A6~ I \nXn(2-n)-n.

The parameter values are as in Figure 1. \nCORNEAL EPITHELIAL WOUND HEALING 143 \nBy analogy with the analysis for the Fisher equation (reviewed in [20]), \nwe rescale the independent variable [ = z\/a giving a boundary value \nproblem for the traveling wave \nl NV+N\u2019+g(N)=O (IO) \nsubject to N( -m) = 1 and N(m) = 0. Here g(N) is defined by (91, \nE = P\/a2 and prime denotes d \/ d[. For our model parameters, E = \n3.83 X 10m3 and we can thus solve the equations analytically as a regular \nperturbation problem in the small parameter E, by looking for a \nsolution of the form \nSubstituting this into (10) and equating coefficients of powers of E gives \nWI = - g(4) (11) \nsubject to N,( - m> = 1, N,,(m) = 0, and Nj( - m) = Ni(0) = N,(m) = 0 for \nall i 2 1; to determine the origin of 5 we must also specify N,(O), as i \nsay. Equation (11) can then be integrated numerically, giving a first-order \napproximation for the wave of cell density that compares well with the \nnumerically simulated solution. \nWe can use this first approximation to the solution to investigate the \ndependence of the slope of the wave front on the model parameter \nvalues. Since the gradient is everywhere negative, a measure of the \nsteepness s^ is the magnitude of the maximum of gradient U\u2019(z) at the \npoint of inflexion of the wave front. Using (ll), the gradient at z = 0 \ngives s^ = - g(k)\/a, which implies that the faster the wave moves, the \nless steep the wave front. Using (91, we find that the steepness depends \ncrucially on the source term. In Figure 7 we plot the change in slope \nwith increasing concentration of EGF; there is a good correspondence \nbetween the steepness of the numerically simulated wave front and the \nanalytically determined slope. \n6. DISCUSSION \nPrevious models have been proposed for general epidermal wound \nhealing [4, 25-291. Here we have presented a model for the specific \ncase of cornea1 epithelial repair, focusing on the effect of EGF on \nmitotic and migratory activity. Numerical simulations indicate that there \nis insufficient EGF in the tear film to heal the wound in the experimen- \ntally observed time and hence we amend our model to include an \nadditional source of chemical at the center of the wound. This source \n144 PAUL D. DALE ET AL. \n1030 2600 3300 4300 5600 sdoo \nSource. A \nFIG. 7. The change in steepness of slope as we increase the source term. The \nwave front becomes less steep with increasing EGF concentration (corresponding to \nincreasing wave speed). The discrepancy between the analytically determined wave \nslope and the steepness of the numerically simulated waves is due to our approxima- \ntion that the derivative terms in the EGF equation are negligible compared to the \nreaction terms. \nterm decays as the cell density increases in the wound and hence \nfurther amendments are necessary to model the final stages of healing. \nBased on experience with scalar reaction diffusion equations [Xl, we \nderive an analytical approximation to the healing rate by looking for a \nchange in the type of eigenvalue at the leading steady state in the \nordinary differential equations governing traveling wave solutions. The \npredicted wave speeds compare favorably with experimental data. An \nimportant biological implication of this result is that the rate of healing \nof cornea1 epithelial wounds can be increased by increasing the cell \ndiffusion coefficient or the secretion rate of the EGF but the chemical \ndiffusion coefficient does not have a significant effect. The results of \nour simple model suggest that serum-derived factors can alone account \nfor the overall features of the healing process and that both migration \nand mitosis are necessary for effective healing. Furthermore, modifica- \ntion of the analytical expression for the wave speed, to include a \nsaturating mitotic generation term, has enabled us to make clinically \ntestable predictions of the healing rate when EGF is applied topically to \nthe wound. \nIn this paper, we have concentrated on the chemical EGF, which has \nbeen established as an important regulator of epithelial repair. We now \nbriefly discuss a number of the other growth factors which play overlap- \nping and synergetic roles during the general wound healing process. \nCORNEAL EPITHELIAL WOUND HEALING 145 \nType (Y transforming growth factor (TGF-CX) is a very similar protein to \nEGF, which binds and activates the EGF receptor, but, although topical \napplication of TGF-a has been shown to increase healing rates in the \nburn wounds [23], its presence in the cornea1 epithelium is biologically \nunproven. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) has both basic and acidic \nforms and topical application of a cocktail of FGFs has been shown to \nincrease mitotic rates and hence speed up healing of cornea1 epithelial \nlesions [13]. However, there is again no evidence for its presence in the \ntear film or its secretion by epithelial cells in response to injury. The \neffects of platelet derived growth factor and TGF-P are restricted to the \nhealing of full depth wounds (reviewed in [lo]>. \nIn the presence of serum-derived growth factors, rapid cell division \noccurs at the margin of a wound in an epithelial cell sheet. Numerous \nattempts have been made to explain this band of increased prolifera- \ntion. Coffey et al. [8] suggested an auto-induction process, for a general \nepithelial wound, showing that wounding by abrasion increases the \ndetectable quantities of TGF-a by freeing bound TGF-a from the \nepidermis of the normal adult breast skin and activating a process which \nreleases bound TGF-(r from the cells. These EGF-like peptides bind to \nEGF receptors and include an enhanced TGF-a synthesis in epithelial \ncells to increase their rate of proliferation. This autocrine feedback \nprocess is the basis of numerous models for epithelial repair [28], and, \nalthough there is evidence to support it in some epithelium, the process \nremains biologically unproven. Ohashi et al. [22] determined the aver- \nage concentration of EGF released by damaged cells and found it to be \nnegligible compared with the tear film concentration. Hence we have \nchosen to neglect any autocrine mechanism in the specific case of the \ncornea. Absence of contact inhibition and change in cell shape also \nincrease the proliferation of the basal cells at the wound edge. Our \nmodel does reflect these effects, although it does not focus on them. \nHowever, a very simple model of these processes involving a single \nreaction diffusion equation for the cell density has been studied previ- \nously and predicts greatly reduced speeds of healing [28]. \nIn this paper, we have considered a quite different explanation for \nthe elevated mitotic rate at the wound edge, based upon the previously \ndiscussed ideas of Barrandon and Green [l] and Dunn and Ireland [12]. \nAlthough these experiments were performed on different cell types, we \nspeculate similar results for EGF and assume that damage to the \nunderlying layers of the cornea cause these to release EGF, near the \ncenter of the wound. The EGF released by this additional source is then \n\u201cmopped up\u201d by the leading row of cells at the wound edge because of \ntheir very high affinity for EGF, resulting in a preferential increase in \nthe mitotic rate and an inward migration to heal the wound. \n146 PAUL D.
