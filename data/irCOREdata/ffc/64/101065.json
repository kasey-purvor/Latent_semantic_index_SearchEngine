Pretreatment\nimproves the yield of tunnel junctions and changes the roughness of the interface between oxide and\nsemiconductor. Electrical characterization confirms that tunnel barriers with appropriate values of\ninterface resistance for efficient spin injection\/detection have been achieved. Using the Rowell\ncriteria and various tunneling models, the authors show that single step tunneling occurs above\n150 K. Incorporating a thermal smearing model suggests that tunneling is the dominant transport\nprocess down to 10 K. \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics. \u0003DOI: 10.1063\/1.2784933\u0004\nControl of spin in semiconductors remains highly\ntopical.1\u20133 Although realizing the spin transistor4 or spin life-\ntime transistor5 has proved to be very difficult, certain con-\ncepts have now been shown to be robust and promising.3\nOptimizing the results requires proper design of interfaces so\nthat polarization is maintained efficiently across interfaces.\nSignificant injection of spin from ferromagnetic \u0001FM\u0002 metals\ninto semiconductors \u0001S\u0002 has been achieved for spin light-\nemitting diodes and it was with these devices that the need\nfor a tunnel barrier injector6\u20138 was confirmed. Narrow gap\nsemiconductors \u0001NGSs\u0002 are attractive because of high elec-\ntron mobility and strong spin-orbit coupling. Building com-\npatible tunnel barriers between NGS and FM metals remains\na challenge, particularly if one is to exploit the spin filtering\nproperties of MgO in FM\/oxide\/S structures.9 MgO is also\nattractive because of its low barrier height.10,11 To harness\nthe advantage offered by MgO, we must understand the elec-\ntrical properties of MgO barriers grown on NGS which are as\nyet unexplored. Consequently, we have carried out a detailed\nstudy to determine the electrical integrity of structurally well\ncharacterized12 MgO barriers with a specific aim to under-\nstand the influence of surface treatment and growth condi-\ntions. Importantly, we find that single step tunneling occurs\nthrough these barriers above 150 K rendering them effective\nfor efficient injection or detection of spin. Moreover, taking\nthermal smearing into account indicates that tunneling is also\nthe dominant transport process at low temperatures.\nThin MgO layers were deposited ex situ onto 1 \u0001m thick\nepilayers of InAs\u0001001\u0002\/GaAs grown by molecular beam epi-\ntaxy. One of three chemical surface treatments was carried\nout on the InAs prior to MgO deposition: \u0001i\u0002 degrease in\nacetone and isopropanol, \u0001ii\u0002 18.5% HCl etch and 2.1%\n\u0001NH4\u00022S for surface passivation \u0001single etch\u0002, \u0001iii\u0002 recipe \u0001ii\u0002\nperformed twice \u0001double etch\u0002. The MgO was grown by re-\nactive sputtering from a Mg target in an Ar\u201330%O2 gas\nmixture. The substrate temperature during the MgO growth\nwas 100 or 200 \u00b0C. After MgO growth, a 20 nm thick film\nof Co was deposited. Details of the growth and structural\nproperties are given in Ref. 12.\nThe three Rowell criteria13 are commonly employed to\nshow that tunneling is dominant: \u0001i\u0002 The barrier current de-\ncays exponentially with increasing insulator thickness. \u0001ii\u0002\nThe conductance spectrum G\u0001V\u0002 is nonlinear, as described\nby the Brinkman-Dynes-Rowell14 \u0001BDR\u0002 model. \u0001iii\u0002 The\ntemperature dependence of the zero bias conductance G0\u0001T\u0002\nis weakly insulatorlike, as described by the Stratton model.15\nHowever, recent studies have shown that criteria \u0001i\u0002 and \u0001ii\u0002\nalone are not sufficient to rule out pinholes in a magnetic\ntunnel junction \u0001MTJ\u0002.16 Furthermore, tunnel junctions can\nexhibit a sharp dip in conductance around zero bias.17,18 This\nis know as the zero bias anomaly \u0001ZBA\u0002 and is usually at-\ntributed to resonant multistep tunneling via impurities which\nis not treated by the above models.\nThe BDR model is conveniently approximated at low\nbias voltages by a second order polynomial yielding three\nindependent fitting parameters. These are generally taken to\nbe the barrier thickness d, the mean barrier height \u0002, and the\nbarrier asymmetry \u0003\u0002. The BDR expression can be found in\nRef. 14, Eq. \u00017\u0002. The Stratton model can give two indepen-\ndent parameters, generally d and \u0002, and is given in conve-\nnient form in Ref. 17, Eq. \u00015\u0002. Recently, however, Miller et\nal. have pointed out two severe shortcomings of Wentzel-\nKramers-Brillouin-based tunneling models such as the BDR\nand Stratton models. Firstly, barrier roughness is not taken\ninto account. Due to the first Rowell criterion, thinner re-\ngions will dominate resulting in lower d than expected anda\u0002Electronic mail: l.cohen@imperial.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 91, 122106 \u00012007\u0002\n0003-6951\/2007\/91\u000212\u0001\/122106\/3\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics91, 122106-1\nDownloaded 03 Jun 2009 to 131.227.178.130.

From a knowledge of the spin\nlifetime in bulk InAs,22 we can estimate the value of\nrb\u000510\u22129\u201310\u221210 \u0006 m2 at room temperature. A direct inter-\nface between gold and InAs yields23 an interface resistance\nof \u000610\u221212 \u0006 m2 and this leaves scope for growing a barrier\nmaterial on the InAs to reach the desired rb. From electrical\ncharacterization of MTJs, MgO tunnel barriers10,11 appear to\nhave a relatively low barrier height of 0.9 eV. This allows us\nto predict, using the Simmons model,24 that to achieve the\ndesired rb the target thickness of MgO should be \u00061.3 nm\non InAs. Table I shows a summary of the values for our\nsamples with rb varying from 3.5\u000710\u22129 to 1.1\n\u000710\u221210 \u0006 m2 which is in the desired range for efficient spin\ninjection and detection in a Co\/MgO\/InAs structure.\nConductance properties vary substantially but all surface\npreparation recipes produce junctions which show signs of\ntunneling. Figure 1 shows typical tunnelinglike G\u0001V\u0002 spectra\nfrom T=10\u2013300 K. G\u0001V\u0002 is parabolic at low V and high T,\nbut below \u0006200 K a sharp dip in conductance appears to\nemerge around zero bias. This ZBA is present in almost all\nour tunneling spectra regardless of growth temperature and\nInAs pretreatment. The BDR model can therefore only be\napplied to the high T data and a fit to the 300 K curve is\nshown in the figure.\nThe right inset to Fig. 1 shows the temperature depen-\ndence of G0\u0001T\u0002 for several junctions on the same wafer as\nshown in the main graph. There is an excellent agreement\nwith the Stratton model above \u0006200 K and the temperature\nbelow which the ZBA emerges agrees with the full conduc-\ntance curves. We find, in the high T regime, both a BDR-like\nG\u0001V\u0002 and a Stratton-like G0\u0001T\u0002 which is a strong indication\nthat tunneling is the dominant transport mechanism in these\njunctions at high T.\nA recent study has shown that the temperature depen-\ndence of the ZBA can be explained by including the effects\nof thermal smearing on the tunneling process.25 By taking\nthe convolution of the low T data \u000110 K\u0002 with a Gaussian\nfunction,26 we can simulate higher T curves and obtain the\neffective smearing temperature T* required to reproduce\nhigher T data, as shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 1. The\nleft inset of Fig. 1 shows a T* to T ratio of approximately 2\n\u0001the previous study finds a ratio of 1.6\u20132.0\u0002.\nThe absolute barrier parameters extracted from the fit-\nting can only be treated as a guide to barrier properties due to\nthe uncertainty in m*. We fix the effective mass to m* \/me\n=0.1 as this gives reasonable values for the fitting param-\neters. Thus, despite the uncertainty about their absolute val-\nues, we can use the fitting parameters as a guide to compare\nelectrical variability between junctions of the same materials.\nA spread in G0 \u0001at fixed T\u0002 between different junctions\non each wafer is observed because of a variation in thickness\n\u0001first Rowell criterion\u0002. Figure 2 shows the relationship be-\ntween G0 at 300 K and the thickness d, as determined by\nfitting to the BDR model. The relationship is indeed close to\nTABLE I. Summary of sample properties.

Interestingly, we find a discontinuity in the\nG0\u0001d\u0002 dependence between the wafers which we show can be\nattributed to the influence of barrier roughness. Perhaps not\nsurprisingly, the mean thickness determined by TEM does\nnot reflect the thickness relevant for electrical transport as\nindicated by the variation across the samples.\nFigure 3 compares the barrier thickness d and height \u0002\nas determined by the BDR model for four different growth\nconditions and pretreatments. The trend of decreasing thick-\nness and increasing barrier height seen across this series of\nsamples corresponds to an increase in interface roughness as\ndetermined by TEM. The influence of roughness on the ef-\nfective parameter values extracted using the BDR model has\nbeen discussed by Miller et al.19 We adopt this model and\nsimulate roughness by assuming that the net conductance is\nthe sum of parallel conductance channels with a Gaussian\ndistribution of thicknesses with standard deviation \b. We\ntake the sample series with the sharpest interface, the double\netched sample, and use the mean extracted thickness of this\nseries as a reference point. As shown in Fig. 3, we find that\nan increase in roughness of \b=1 \u00c5 \u000110%\u0002 and \b=2 \u00c5 \u000120%\u0002\ncan account for the apparent decrease in d and increase in \u0002\nfor the degreased and single etched samples, respectively.\nThe high roughness of the single etched samples is rein-\nforced by conducting AFM which shows the presence of\nhigh current, pinholelike features.12\nIn summary, we have grown Co\/ \u00061.3 nm MgO\/InAs\ntrilayer structures with contact resistance values that are suit-\nable for efficient spin injection\/detection. The BDR and\nStratton models have been used to determine whether tunnel-\ning dominates the conductance. A thermal smearing model\ngives further confirmation that tunneling dominates at all\ntemperatures. Once the influence of roughness is taken into\naccount, we find that the electrical properties of the barrier\nare relatively insensitive to surface pretreatment and growth\ntemperature.\nThis work was supported by the UK-EPSRC Grant No.\nEP\/C511972 and EP\/C511980.
