Finally the article takes the complex\ncircumstances of Kant\u2019s home city, Kaliningrad, as a brief test case for his own theories.\nKeywords: Kaliningrad, Kant, perpetual peace, world federalism\nIntroduction\nIn a rare tribute to an academic philosopher, the 200th anniversary of Immanuel\nKant\u2019s death was marked by the visit of the German foreign minister, Joschka\nFischer, to Kaliningrad. Kaliningrad, or Koenigsberg as it was formerly called, was\nKant\u2019s birthplace and home throughout his life. The city was in Kant\u2019s day the\nprincipal centre of population in East Prussia and had at one time been the capital\nof Prussia itself. In the course of his brief visit Fischer officially opened the new\nconsulate offices of Germany in the city and laid a wreath at Kant\u2019s tomb alongside\nthe cathedral. The former Soviet enclave is now stranded as part of the Russian\nFederation, with Lithuania to the east and a border to the west with Poland. This\nwas a poignant occasion: not simply because it marked 200 years since Kant\u2019s\ndeath, but also because it took place in a city with such a complex history. The\nposition of the former German city of Koenigsberg as a Russian enclave, now\nencircled by new member states of the European Union, looks precarious \u2013 a far cry\nfrom the thriving Prussian port and most easterly outpost of the German-speaking\nworld that it was in Kant\u2019s lifetime. This complex and, from a German perspective,\ntragic history brings out the importance of world politics to the lives of individuals.\nAlmost to a person the population of Kaliningrad is Russian-speaking, and there is\nhardly a trace of the rich German cultural past, with the number of German speakers\nin the enclave to be counted in their hundreds rather than thousands. If Kant has\nsomething to tell us about world peace then it may also have a bearing on the\ncondition of his uniquely situated home city. Before 1945 Koenigsberg was a major\nri\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \ncity in the German Reich. During the Cold War as Kaliningrad it was a major warm-\nwater port of the Soviet Union. Now, without a direct land connection, it is the most\nwesterly part of the Russian Federation.\nHere my main focus in evaluating Kant\u2019s theory of world politics is his\nremarkable Perpetual Peace.2 I take each of the sections of this book and subject\nthem in turn to scrutiny. Perpetual Peace begins with a short introduction and six\nPreliminary Articles whose observance Kant believes to be an essential pre-\ncondition for peace. He then turns to the three Definitive Articles which we can here\nbriefly denote as the republican article, the federative article and the cosmopolitan\narticle. There are four more sections whose importance is often overlooked: an\nappendix which outlines the guarantee of peace; a Secret Article added to the\nsecond and French editions of the book; and two additions that crucially discuss the\nrelationship between politics, morality and statesmanship. I give a critical overview\nof each of these sections, drawing out some of the lessons for us now, and then\ncomplete the article with some brief reflections on how Kaliningrad\u2019s situation\nmight be affected by a sensitive interpretation of Kant\u2019s ideas. One of the concerns\nof the article will be to bring Kant\u2019s reputation out of the shadow of the idealist\u2013\nrealist divide that international relations theory has cast upon his writings. Kant has\nthoroughly systematic things to say about both the normative and factual sides of\ninternational politics. Indeed, he has a coherent theory of international relations that\neffectively combines the two.\nA key conclusion of Kant\u2019s critical philosophy is that we have to be modest\nabout what we can know, but we have to be ambitious about what we ought to do.\nPerpetual Peace is not simply a book commenting from a philosophical perspective\non what can be done about politics. It represents a point of culmination of Kant\u2019s\ncritical enterprise, at least in so far as its practical aspect is concerned. Perpetual\nPeace indicates how statesmen and ordinary individuals can contribute to the\nattainment of the \u2018politico-civil state\u2019, which represents a crucial stage in the\nattainment of the ultimate goal for humankind of the \u2018highest moral good\u2019. The\nconcept of the highest moral good is one that Kant had introduced in his essay\nReligion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason (1793) to indicate \u2018a duty not of\nhuman beings towards human beings but of the human race toward itself\u2019.3 The\nrealization of this duty would be \u2018a universal republic based on the laws of virtue\u20194\nencompassing the human race as a whole and is distinct from a political\ncommonwealth which requires general external constraint. Though distinct from it,\nthe ideal of an ethical commonwealth can provide inspiration for the creation and\nmaintenance of a political commonwealth. What would constitute the ideal goal in\nthe political realm, and is a goal to which all politicians should necessarily strive, is\nto bring the human race out of its present apparently natural condition of war. The\ngoal is not as comprehensive as that of \u2018the highest moral good\u2019 (since that concerns\nour inner dispositions as well), but the achievement of the legal relations that are\nthe focus of the political ideal is nonetheless an important step along the road\ntowards it. The highest political good consists of the ideal set of relations that\nregulate the external relations of human individuals with each other. Perpetual\n28 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 20(1)\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nPeace is inspired by this ideal of the highest political good.5 Thus the pursuit of\nperpetual peace plays a foundational role in Kant\u2019s moral philosophy.\nOne of his key targets in Perpetual Peace is the traditional mindset of the\nworldly-wise statesman. It has been suggested that Kant\u2019s immediate inspiration in\nwriting the essay was the conclusion of the Treaty of Basle between Prussia and\nrevolutionary France on 5 April 1795 which arguably represented more of an\narmistice than a lasting peace agreement.6 He did not think he should hold his\nsilence in the face of the rapidly changing circumstances of European politics.\nPerhaps this is why he tells the tale of the pub in Holland that was named \u2018The\nPerpetual Peace\u2019 and on its sign was painted the picture of a graveyard.7 Kant points\nout to political leaders in the Introduction that they cannot have it both ways. They\ncannot, on the one hand, regard themselves as people of great moment whose\ndecisions are far removed from the abstract concerns of philosophers and, on the\nother, claim to take great offence when such an abstract theorist expresses a view\nwhich is contrary to their own. The \u2018worldly-wise statesman need not turn a hair\u2019,\nhe argues, when the philosopher fires \u2018off his whole broadside\u2019.8 These ironic\ncomments were not intended to signify that he saw no role for political leaders in a\nprogramme to improve the human condition. It is a part of his realism that he sees\nthem as the most significant agents in bringing about change, but it is a part of his\nidealism that they can only fulfil that role satisfactorily if they radically alter the\ntheoretical basis on which they act.\nThe Preliminary Articles\nNowhere does human nature appear less admirable than in the relationships\nwhich exist between peoples. No state is for a moment secure from the others in\nits independence and its possessions. The will to subjugate the others or to grow\nat their expense is always present, and the production of armaments for defence,\nwhich often makes peace more oppressive and more destructive of internal\nwelfare than war itself, can never be relaxed.9\nThis is how international relations appeared to Kant in 1793 as he prepared to write\nhis short book Perpetual Peace. He was under no illusions as to what animated the\nleaders of state most generally in their relations with one another. He was fully\naware that the rulers of the world looked down with contempt on those who would\nwish to see an improvement to a better state of affairs as dreamers and academic\nscribblers. Nonetheless, Kant concluded that \u2018there is no possible way of counter-\nacting\u2019 the woeful conditions amongst peoples except \u2018through a state of inter-\nnational right, based upon enforceable public laws to which each should submit\u2019.10\nKant thought it a helpful analogy to consider the present conditions of international\nrelations as on a par with the relations amongst individuals in the state of nature\nprior to the creation of a civil society. In his view of the state of nature Kant agrees\nwith Locke and Rousseau that \u2018it need not because it is natural, be a state of\nBACK FROM THE USSR 29\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \ninjustice\u2019 but he goes on to disagree with both and to concur with Hobbes that \u2018it is\nstill a state devoid of justice, in which rights are in dispute\u2019 where there \u2018would be\nno judge competent to render a verdict having rightful force\u2019. \u2018Since each has its\nown right to do what seems right and good and not to be dependent on another\u2019s\nopinion on this\u2019, in the state of nature \u2018peoples and states can never be secure\nagainst violence from one another\u2019.11 For him the undeniable equivalence between\nthe two conditions brings out the current immaturity of the human race. It seems to\nhim that we are insufficiently responsible to take the rational step of founding an\neffective legal order amongst states in the same way that as individuals we took the\nstep out of the state of nature by founding a state. What would demonstrate our\nmaturity at an international level would be the emergence of an enforceable\ninternational law.\nSo this is the goal for Kant: the creation of a worldwide civil union in the same\nmanner as we have already effectively created (not everywhere, but in many parts)\ndomestic civil unions. By a \u2018civil union\u2019 Kant means an organized society based\nupon the rule of law where everyone is entitled to hold on to what is rightfully\ntheirs. Within a civil union, in other words, we find there is distributive justice.12 To\nbe satisfied with the current condition, where a fair proportion of the world\u2019s\npopulation lives within a successful domestic civil union yet nonetheless puts up\nwith a world political structure that has no generally enforceable law, is unac-\nceptable for Kant. He sees it as unacceptable on two grounds. Firstly, it is morally\nunacceptable because we cannot deal with all fellow inhabitants of the planet in the\nway we ought, as equal individuals with rights which we have always to respect. Of\ncourse we should and can attempt to deal with them as though such rights were\nalready universally respected, but we can always expect \u2013 whilst not all peoples\nhave truly civil governments \u2013 to be frustrated in this aim. This is the idealist\nobjection to the current state of affairs, but Kant also puts forward the realist\nobjection that the current position offers no prospect of long-term stability. Kant\nthinks that it is, secondly, not acceptable because circumstances will always ensure\nthat a world without a common legal structure is factually undermined. In other\nwords, the future development of world politics, with wholly independent sover-\neign states unconstrained by effective legal ties, will, based on past experience,\ndrive unavoidably in the direction of conflict. To avoid this conflict and so to sustain\ntheir own internal order successful civil societies will seek change. The everyday\nactivities that occur within civil societies and the normal activities that civil\nsocieties will want to engage in with other peoples (such as travel, trade, migration\nand general cultural interaction) cannot occur on a stable basis in a perpetually\nhostile environment.13 It is in the interest of the peoples of the world to step out of\nthe international \u2018state of nature\u2019 and create a lasting universal civil order.14\nThus what the worldly-wise politician might dismiss as mere abstract theorizing,\nwhich overlooks the actual condition of humankind, is presented by Kant as an\nessential \u2013 if permanently open to deferral \u2013 move for the human race. Instead of\nlooking only to what the relations amongst peoples (often at their worst) are like,\nKant puts his \u2018trust in the theory of what the relationships between men and states\n30 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 20(1)\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nought to be according to the principle of right\u2019.15 The realist outlook in international\npolitics seems primarily to commend itself to its advocates because it appears to\naccord with our knowledge of the darker side of human beings and the actual course\nof relations amongst states, but it also proves attractive to political leaders because\nit provides a justification for their low ambitions in the conduct of policy.\nConcluding that human beings cannot reliably relate to each other in a rightful way\nin the international sphere provides encouragement and justification for not\nadhering to rightful policies. As Machiavelli puts it in his advocacy of unprincipled\npolicies, the prince need not keep his word because men, \u2018wretched creatures\u2019 that\nthey are, would not keep theirs.16 Realist policies therefore reinforce the current\nuncivil tendencies of world politics. The usual explanation that is provided for poor\npolicies and undesirable outcomes is employed to justify low expectations and\nhard-nosed strategies. In this way realism as a doctrine is both explanatory and\nconstitutive of the international relations we experience.\nThe first six Preliminary Articles of Perpetual Peace represent a manifesto\nagainst such realism in international politics and prepare the way for the positive\nmeasures that would help bring about peace. They deal with the ways in which\nunprincipled political leaders might consider themselves to be above the require-\nment to bring about peace. This is immediately evident in Preliminary Article 1\nwhere he forbids rulers to enter into peace negotiations with \u2018a secret reservation of\nthe material for a future war\u2019.17 He suggests positive measures that will bring them\nall to book. Kant foresees that worldly-wise politicians might seek to wriggle out of\nthe necessary commitments that would make a peace effective and so spells out the\nrules that they must adhere to. In this spirit Preliminary Articles 2 and 5 require that\nleaders should give up ambitions of conquest and forcible interference with the\nconstitutions and governments of other states. He also seeks to sweep away\nstructural causes of war in these articles. Two such structural causes of war Kant\ndeals with in Preliminary Articles 3 and 4. Kant thinks that the professionalization\nand institutionalization of war that can occur through the existence of standing\narmies should be weakened through the creation of citizens\u2019 armies drawn from the\npeople themselves.\nThus, from a Kantian perspective, countries that maintain conscription (such as\nGermany and Israel today \u2013 although both admittedly retain a professional core) are\nto be preferred to countries that maintain wholly professional armies. He also thinks\nthat states ought not to conduct wars on the basis of monies raised through the\nexpansion of national debt (Article 4). In his view this use of the national debt\nmakes it too easy to wage war. Although it would be difficult for current states that\nall have sizeable national debts already to adhere precisely to this rule, there is\narguably virtue in Kant\u2019s recommendation that the leaders of states should restrain\ntheir pursuit of war to what can be financed from current income. Arguably\nhistorical circumstances have changed to such an extent since Kant\u2019s day that these\ntwo articles might no longer be regarded as crucial to the success of his project. The\nraising of monies to wage a war through an expansion of the national debt was\nnovel in Kant\u2019s day, but nowadays national debt plays such a large part in funding\nBACK FROM THE USSR 31\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \npublic services in general that it would seem unrealistic to place limitations on its\nuse in the pursuit of foreign policy aims. Similarly, it might be argued that it is well-\nnigh impossible nowadays to organize armed forces effectively without some\npermanent commitment of staff. The technical skills required in some fields are so\nadvanced (e.g. surveillance and the guidance of weapons) that only a career officer\ncan carry them out. This can, indeed, be granted, but it is nonetheless the case that\nthe principles advanced in these two articles provide some benchmarks for the\npolitician. Politicians should at least be put in the position where they have to\nprovide justifications for breaching the guidance they offer. There is a permanent\nbenefit to paying attention to these two Preliminary Articles although the conditions\nunder which they have to be implemented have changed considerably.\nBut the main focus of the Preliminary Articles is not so much upon concrete\npolicy proposals as the maxims that political leaders adopt in pursuing policies.\nKant wants to ensure that these maxims are not inconsistent with the emergence of\nlasting peace. Preliminary Article 6 represents a particularly striking example. Its\nmain point is as apt as ever:\nno state at war with another shall permit such acts of hostility as would make\nmutual confidence impossible during a future time of peace. Such acts would\ninclude the appointment of assassins or poisoners, breach of agreements, the\ninstigation of treason within the enemy state and so on.18\nThis is a principle that seems wholly to be neglected in the present conduct of the\nwar in the Middle East between the Israelis and the Palestinians. There seems to be\nlittle hope of lasting peace arising from a situation where no agreements are kept;\nwhere ceasefires are only temporary so that each may regroup their forces; where it\nis thought acceptable on both sides to target innocent civilians; and where the\nassassination of political opponents is a policy adopted and regularly practised by\nthe leaders of a civil state.19 From a Kantian perspective it is not surprising that\nthere is a widespread revulsion at the use of such tactics in political disputes. The\nrevulsion arises from the realization that underhand, disreputable and, above all,\ninhumane tactics are incompatible with long-term peace. Where despicable\natrocities occur they will neither lightly be forgotten nor forgiven. They imply that\nno side desires to live with the other. They have no care how their opponents\nperceive them. But this entire disregard for one another is both a symptom and a\ncause of the conflict. Just as individuals who have ultimately to live with their\nfellow citizens should attempt to retain a perspective when they fall into dispute\nwith one another \u2013 and so avoid taking too drastic measures in the heat of their\nconflict \u2013 so societies at war with one another should also have a regard for their\nlong-term common occupancy of the one planet (and, in most instances, neigh-\nbouring part of the world) when in conflict with one another. The exercise of\nrestraint in war is a mark of our common humanity, and though not itself a peaceful\naction, it does not bar the way towards peace in the future. Mutual respect and trust\nshould not altogether be abandoned even in war.\n32 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 20(1)\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nFirst Definitive Article\nThe recommendation of republican constitutions in the First Definitive Article is\nperhaps the best-known aspect of Kant\u2019s outline for peace. This article has aroused\nconsiderable interest in the post-Cold War era and the time leading up to it. The\nargument that states with democratic political institutions were less likely to engage\nin war (as Kant\u2019s First Definitive Article implies) was advanced by Doyle20 in the\nearly 1980s and augmented and repeated by Fukuyama in the following decade.21\nThey were two of the leading advocates of an argument that was to be described as\nthe \u2018democratic peace thesis\u2019 that was to occupy a large number of scholars for a\nconsiderable time (and still does so).22 Kant stressed that he thought states with\nrepublican constitutions might be less likely to go to war because those who have\nto bear the brunt of the war, in terms of fighting and paying for it, would be making\nthe decisions (through their representatives).23 For Kant a republican constitution\nhas two key features: there is a separation of powers between the legislature and the\nexecutive (the judiciary should also be independent of these powers); and the\nlegislature is made up of the people\u2019s representatives. In this republic the authority\nto go to war would lie with the sovereign which is the legislature. All the inde-\npendent citizens, those who owed their existence to no one other than themselves,\nwould elect the legislature. Kant regarded those who worked for others, such as\nwage labourers, domestic servants, minor civil servants and all women and children\nas dependent subjects of the commonwealth and therefore not entitled to vote.\nApart from the undeniably selective element in this choice of those entitled to vote,\nKant perhaps also underestimated how remote the people\u2019s representatives could\nget from those they served, and also how states with republican constitutions would\nnot take the step he recommends in Preliminary Article 3 that standing armies\nshould be abolished. As yet, it is difficult to say that the majority of the world\u2019s\nconstitutionally founded states have truly republican forms of government, and\nwhere they do very few have citizen armies.\nNonetheless, it is true that empirically modern republican states are less likely to\nmake war with one another, although they do frequently make war on non-liberal\nstates.24 In one respect the validity of Kant\u2019s argument has been borne out. However\nthe propensity of states with republican or near-republican constitutions to go to\nwar with states outside their circle must call into question the pacific credentials of\npoliticians within republics. They have clearly lower thresholds for determining the\nacceptability of war in relation to states outside their \u2018charmed\u2019 circle than they do\nfor those within it. Democratization is occurring in the post-Cold War world but it\ndoes not always lead to the satisfactory emergence of the two features that Kant\nprizes: representative legislatures and the separation of power between the exec-\nutive and legislature. And where they are present as a result of the process there is\na tendency on the part of political leaders to subvert their effective operation.\nBACK FROM THE USSR 33\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nSecond Definitive Article\nThe recommendation contained in the Second Definitive Article that \u2018the law of\nnations be based on a federation of free states\u2019 has arguably been less well\nunderstood. Some commentators, perhaps mistakenly, have connected the idea with\nthe development of actual alliances (such as NATO) and organizations of states\n(such as the European Union or the earlier League of Nations) and argued that this\ndemonstrates (or does not demonstrate) the viability of the idea.25 Most have\noverlooked that Kant recommends the federation not simply as the day-to-day basis\nfor regulating political relations amongst states, but also as a norm to be adhered to\nin understanding and implementing international law. Thus when actual federations\nfrom time to time fail this does not relieve the member states of the obligation to\nrelate to each other as though they were part of a federation of free states. The\nimpressive development of international law in the twentieth century, particularly\nin the period after 1989, with the strengthening and use of the International Court\nof Justice and the increasing acceptance of its jurisdiction (both within states and\namongst them) testifies to the good sense of Kant\u2019s argument.26 In this period a\nvariety of alliances, organizations and unions have vied for the possible role of a\npeaceful worldwide federation with varied success. The fact that no entirely satis-\nfactory world organization has emerged that has the continuous support of all states\nhas not prevented the idea of such a possible worldwide federation from influencing\nthe legal relations amongst states. Antonio Cassese speaks of the \u2018gradual inter-\npenetration and cross-fertilization of previously somewhat compartmentalized\nareas of international law\u2019 in the recent period that shows \u2018at least at the normative\nlevel the international community is becoming more integrated\u2019.27\nThe growth of international institutions such as the UN and the EU, and other\nregional institutions such as the Organization of African States and ASEAN,\nprovides grounds for optimism not because they represent the literal realization of\nKant\u2019s ideal but because they provide strong evidence of greater global integration.\nA key feature of Kant\u2019s Second Definitive Article is, in my view, its lack of great\ninstitutional emphasis. In Perpetual Peace he neither points to any actual federation\nthat fulfils his model nor does he use any direct historical analogies to illustrate his\npoint.28 The most he concretely points to is the possibility that a powerful\nrepublican state might, through the strength of its example, encourage the formation\nof a peaceful federation which would have as its aim not the prosecution of war but\nthe termination of all wars. It is often thought that Kant here has in mind France\nwhose new republican constitution he greatly admired. Nowadays we might regard\nthe mantle as falling upon the United States since it has a constitution that arguably\nclosely matches the ideal Kant outlines. The power of example (and not the\nexample of power) is Kant\u2019s key ingredient in the achievement of peace. The\ndownplaying of formal institutional arrangements, coupled with the view that each\nstate should retain its freedom within this peaceful federation does, in my view,\nprovide a workable basis for extending peace globally.\nHidemi Suganami is correct in his intimation \u2018that the basic structure of Kant\u2019s\n34 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 20(1)\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nargument was along the lines of the domestic analogy: states must unite into an\ninternational body just as it was necessary for individuals to unite under separate\nstates\u2019.29 On analogy with individuals who have joined together to establish a civil\nsociety, states that are free also have everything to gain from seeking to live in peace\nwith one another. It is important this should be seen as an analogy and not as\nprecisely the same process. Individuals without a state have no possibility of living\njustly, so there is a moral obligation on individuals to force others with whom they\nhave contact into this condition. However, once states have been established there\nis at least a provisional justice at the domestic level so that states are neither morally\nrequired nor entitled to coerce other states into a federation with them. They are\nthough morally required to grasp the inadequacy of this provisional justice which\nmakes war a permanent possibility and to seek to overcome it through a continually\nenlarging peaceful federation. This peaceful federation is thus a surrogate for the\nstate at the internal level. It is not the existence of international institutions such as\nthe United Nations, the European Union or NATO that represents the sole issue\nfrom a Kantian perspective, but also whether or not there is the gradual develop-\nment of a more binding international law based on the federative outlook of leaders\nof states.\nKant did not recommend the direct step to a world state. World unification from\nthe top down could lead only to a universal despotism. Rather we should try to\napproximate to the ideal of one internal world order through a gradually expanding\nfederation. In this one internal world order the borders between states would slowly\nbegin to be seen by their citizens more like the boundaries between regions in the\none country. Common territory would not mark the limits of their common\nconcerns.30 The fundamental political units would remain individual states, but they\nwould relate to each other in a legally regulated way and their leaders would\nrecognize their actions were under the jurisdiction of international law. As\nSuganami puts it in spelling out the implications of the domestic analogy: \u2018states\nwould no longer exercise their legal independence selfishly, but accept it as their\nprinciple to act as though they were bound by a supreme legislative authority\nenacting laws for the common good of mankind\u2019.31 Kant seems to have envisaged\nthis as a relationship in principle amongst equals, although some states inevitably\nwould be more powerful than others. Kant does not want to see a federal state made\nup of nations (where the centre might command the members) but a federation of\nstates where there would be no relationship of superior to inferior. Within each state\nthere is naturally an unequal relationship between the subject and the political\nauthority but in the kind of expanding federation he conceives this relationship of\nsubordination amongst states would be absent.32\nThird Definitive Article\nThe Third Definitive Article of Perpetual Peace outlines Kant\u2019s principle of\ncosmopolitanism. From a moral perspective what cosmopolitanism signifies for\nBACK FROM THE USSR 35\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nKant is concern for the flourishing of humankind as a whole and it forms an\nunderlying theme of his critical philosophy. In the Critique of Pure Reason he\ndistinguishes between the indispensable scholastic aims of philosophy that form\none part of its key purpose and the wider cosmopolitan aims that form the other part.\nIn Kant\u2019s view, the scholasticism is demeaned if the wider cosmopolitan aim of the\n\u2018destiny\u2019 of the human species is lost sight of.33 The destiny of the human species\nis that we should form a dominion of ends \u2018where each of them is to treat himself\nand all others never merely as means but always at the same time as ends in\nthemselves\u2019.34 This is the ultimate goal that underlies all virtuous human activity.\nIn the Third Definitive Article Kant attempts to spell out the political implications\nof this precept. This is that \u2018cosmopolitan right shall be limited to the condition of\nuniversal hospitality\u2019. Another way of putting this is: \u2018the right of a stranger not to\nbe treated with hostility when he arrives on someone else\u2019s territory\u2019.35 This means\nthat we are not to deal in a hostile or antagonistic way with visitors to our country.\nWe are to conceive ourselves as forming with them, as rational beings and fellow\ninhabitants of the same planet, a dominion of ends. This does not imply that Kant\nis advocating an open house. We are entitled to return such visitors to their point of\nentry as long as their freedom and dignity are not harmed. A positive welcome for\nsuch visitors is of course better, but this cannot be seen as a duty of right (or law).\nWhat right requires is that we should not regard visitors from territories other than\nour own as enemies.\nHowever, Kant\u2019s principle of cosmopolitanism should also be seen in relation to\nour visits to countries outside our own. There are important implications here that\nKant does not overly stress but were nonetheless vital to him. In visiting other\ncountries we should see ourselves as guests. This means we should not help our-\nselves to the possessions of others and their territory. We can only rightly acquire\nthose things through the cooperation and agreement of the resident population. In\nthis respect the requirements of Kant\u2019s principle of cosmopolitanism contrast\nmarkedly with the record of European expansion in the modern period. All\nEuropean colonialism and imperialism of the modern period ran entirely counter to\nthis principle.\nOf course, this principle of cosmopolitanism has implications for political and\nmilitary intervention now. Preliminary Articles 2 and 5 of Perpetual Peace rule out\ndirect intervention as an acceptable policy. The second does in the largest sense in\nthat it forbids states from acquiring other states \u2018by inheritance, exchange, purchase\nor gift\u2019.36 This article represents a considerable understatement by Kant, since in\nrejecting the modes of acquisition he lists he clearly implies that the acquisition of\nanother state by the use of force is wholly ruled out. The fifth article rules out\nintervention in the more specific sense, which reinforces this view that \u2018no state\nshall forcibly interfere in the constitution and government of another state\u2019.37 Kant\nsees the independence of a state as analogous to the freedom of an adult individual\nin a settled modern society. Within such a civil society we allow others to follow\ntheir own course so long as they do not interfere with the freedom of their fellow\ncitizens. We cannot prevent our fellow citizens from following through their\n36 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 20(1)\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nlawfully permitted choices, even if we form the opinion that they might be bad for\nthem or for ourselves. Independent states like free individuals are entitled to make\ntheir own mistakes. If a state sets a bad example for others and endures miseries as\na result of its own foolhardiness this, just as with the individual, is a price we have\nto pay for our own independence. For Kant the possible right of interference may\narise if we are a neighbouring state whose own sovereignty and security is risked\nby disturbances. Where a nearby people refuses to enter the civil condition and to\nrecognize and respect our own then it may legitimately be forced to conform:\nIt is usually assumed that one cannot take hostile action against anyone unless\none has already been actively injured by them. This is perfectly correct if both\nparties are living in a legal civil state. For the fact that the one has entered such\na state gives the required guarantee to the other, since both are subject to the\nsame authority. But a human being (or an individual people) in a mere state of\nnature robs me of any such security and already wrongs me just by being near\nme in this condition . . . and I can coerce him either to enter into a condition of\nbeing under civil law or to leave my neighbourhood.38\nThus peoples who do not properly establish a civil union or have lapsed from that\ncondition cannot complain when they have order imposed upon them from outside.\nA nation that does not respect and implement the rule of law does not qualify as an\nindependent state.\nKant therefore sets a very high threshold for the permissibility of intervention\nwithin the boundaries of other states. In international politics no leaders should see\nfit to set themselves up as the final judge of the quality of political life in other\nstates. As with the individual in civil society, we should all practise tolerance in\njudging the actions of others, even where we are convinced they might be harming\nthemselves in what they do.39 But Kant is aware of the knock-on effects of conflict\nwithin states upon other states. Internal conflicts that spill over and lead to illegal\ninterference with the rights of other states and their subjects can legitimately lead\nto intervention. Where a state is failing and other neighbouring countries have to\nbear the consequences, then it may be right for them and their allies to act. Kant\nthough greatly prizes the autonomy of states and such intervention should always\nbe resorted to only when it is evident that a people no longer have a functioning\nconstitution and sovereign. Preliminary Article 5 might appear to make contem-\nporary attempts at humanitarian intervention beyond the scope of Kant\u2019s project for\nperpetual peace. However, Kant notes in the comments to the same article that the\ncondition of states subject to internal turmoil might make the prohibition on\nexternal interference temporarily invalid. Thus where there is a clear breakdown in\ninternal order and a society is divided into two or more camps each claiming\nsovereign authority (and so as a consequence there being none), outside support to\nbring the anarchy to an end is defensible. The key point in assessing the\ndefensibility of the intervention has to be the extent to which the state has ceased to\nexist in its previous sovereign form.\nBACK FROM THE USSR 37\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nThus, today\u2019s humanitarian intervention might be acceptable from Kant\u2019s\nperspective where it takes place in a society without effective law and where there\nis at least one warring party that might potentially form a successful new sovereign\nbody.40 Such examples are wholly consistent with Kant\u2019s ban on forcible inter-\nvention in the constitutional affairs of other states, since countries that are torn with\ncivil war no longer have effective constitutions.41 Kant deplored revolutionary\npolitics and thought that political improvement should always be sought by peace-\nful means from above. However, Kant does acknowledge that where sovereign\npower is no longer effective then I can join with others forcibly to institute a new\nsovereign power. To determine whether or not this is the case is a matter of sound\npolitical judgment that should be informed by the most rigorous political theory and\nthe most precise knowledge of the facts. In this assessment the principles of right\nshould be the touchstone to which political expediency should always be\nsubordinate.\nThe guarantee of perpetual peace\nThe surprising thing about this first addendum to Perpetual Peace is that it does not\nprovide us with an absolute guarantee of progress to world peace at all. In this\nrespect Kant\u2019s argument differs from the interpretation that has been given to his\nwork by contemporary commentators such as Doyle and Fukuyama. In this adden-\ndum Kant reminds us how human history might be interpreted teleologically42 as\nleading necessarily to the improvement of the species, but warns us that we cannot\nempirically take this to be the case. That human individuals have been scattered to\nall corners of the earth by their own competitiveness and acquisitiveness; that this\nprocess of dispersal cannot be endless \u2013 at some point we have to turn back in on\nourselves and live with others; that language and religion divide people and peoples\nand make them always attempt to better themselves; in short that our irascibility\nleads us contrary to our tendency towards laziness and idle contentment to become\never more cultured and skilful. This indeed provides material for a teleological\naccount but does not constitute cast-iron proof of progress.\nKant uses the term \u2018asociable sociability\u2019 to describe the irascible tendency in\nhuman beings that spurs them on to develop themselves more fully. Human beings\nhave a propensity both to seek to acquire the recognition of others and at the same\ntime to avoid too much contact with them. We need others even though they quite\noften irritate us. The term is deployed in the essay \u2018Idea for a Universal History with\na Cosmopolitan Purpose\u2019, where Kant claims that the human being \u2018expects resis-\ntance all round, just as he knows of himself that he is in turn inclined to offer\nresistance to others\u2019.43 This asociable sociability has to be properly harnessed if\nhuman beings are going to live in peace with one another. Kant\u2019s stress on it brings\nout the realism of his approach.\nEven war itself can be seen as having progressive implications. Although war\namongst sovereign states is for Kant the worst of all evils, by engaging all the\n38 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 20(1)\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \npowers of those people involved in them it forces them against their inclinations to\nbecome more competent, effective and efficient. Human skills are increased\nenormously under the pressure of our own possible extinction. War, moreover,\nteaches us of its own dangers. Peoples exhausted after long and destructive wars are\nbrought to realize that they must seek better ways of regulating their relations with\none another. Thus even without the intervention of moral leaders and peoples we\ncan interpret the haphazard development of human history as tending towards\nbetterment. But this guarantee of progress exists not as a factual one (we cannot just\nsit back and expect the world to improve) but as a guide for practical reason. By\npractical reason Kant means here our own inner moral deliberations, something we\nmight normally designate as the use of our conscience. The \u2018guarantee of perpetual\npeace\u2019 is a confirmation that the moral efforts of the good state\u2019s leader and virtuous\nsubjects are not to be seen as without worth. This represents the idealism of his\napproach. We are not to accept the Machiavellian view of the role of political\nleaders, and so to bolster the efforts of rulers to act in a peace-like way we are\nlegitimately entitled to regard circumstances as not standing in the way of\nimprovement.\nThus Kant\u2019s guarantee of perpetual peace is not an attempt to demonstrate that\nworld peace is inevitable and so to hasten to bring it about. Rather he is arguing for\nthe more open-ended view that if we look at the record so far no one can say with\ncertainty that improvement has not occurred and is not occurring. There is no\nirrefutable empirical case for pessimism that should stand in the way of a state\u2019s\nleader seeking to change things for the better. Realism is accorded its due but it is\nnot allowed to extinguish the idealist thread in Kant\u2019s thinking. For it is only from\nthe normative perspective that Kant believes that there is an unanswerable case for\nhighlighting and taking advantage of those respects in which the human race is\nimproving. Thus even if world history is regarded as having taken a turn for the\nworse (as it did with the war against revolutionary France), and the evidence for\nprogress is apparently very slight, there is no overwhelming case for Kant to give\nup his project.\nThe normative dimension and the role of the philosopher\nThat everything does depend on moral politicians \u2013 or human intervention \u2013 can be\nseen from the final two supplements to Perpetual Peace. In the first, concerning the\napparent failure of morality and politics to coincide in their bearing on perpetual\npeace, Kant seeks to remove the objections to a political leader abiding by moral\nprinciples by showing how amoral strategies undermine themselves. (For example,\nthe Machiavellian leader who consistently fails to keep their word will find fairly\nswiftly that no one will take their word.) The comparative length of this supple-\nment, \u2018On the disagreement between morals and politics in relation to perpetual\npeace\u2019, taken together with the space devoted to its partner, the second supplement,\ndemonstrates where Kant\u2019s main concerns lie with the acceptability of his\nBACK FROM THE USSR 39\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nargument. The two supplements occupy almost the same space in the essay as\nKant\u2019s concrete proposals in the Preliminary and Definitive Articles, illustrating his\nworry that the ordinary person and the political leader would not so much dismiss\nspecific policy recommendations, as the whole idea that principles should play an\nimportant part in determining political decisions and foreign policy in particular. In\nPerpetual Peace Kant is tackling (almost primarily) the common prejudice that\npolitics is a devious, immoral art. This is not merely a preoccupation of Kant in his\npeace essay; it also surfaces in an earlier essay, \u2018On the Common Saying: This May\nbe True in Theory, but it Does Not Apply in Practice\u2019 (1793). He objects very\nstrongly to the common presumption that political leaders have to be worldly-wise\nand not pay heed to moral considerations (unless they are to their advantage). The\nMachiavellian believes that in a world of beasts the political leader must be\nprepared to act like a beast (combining the cunning of the fox with the strength and\ndaring of the lion) or else he will be devoured.44 The advocates of power politics\nwere very much in evidence in Kant\u2019s time; he draws attention to one such writing,\nOn Combining Morality with Politics, by the Silesian popular philosopher Christian\nGarve in the final pages of Perpetual Peace.45\nIn responding to Garve, Kant wants to tackle the view that moral principles are\nmerely a side issue \u2013 and that prudence should come before justice \u2013 when it comes\nto determining the policies of state. This to him is one of the biggest obstacles to the\nimprovement of political life and relations amongst states. To understand the\nargument Kant wants to put we have not to take this to mean that the political leader\nshould neglect astuteness and care in determining choices. What people fail to see\n(or deliberately overlook) is that it is possible to combine care, prudence and\nastuteness with moral principles. Kant can perfectly understand that it is sound\nadvice for a politician to seek to be as wise as a \u2018serpent\u2019; however, the advice of\nthe philosopher that the politician should also seek to be as \u2018harmless as a dove\u2019\nshould also be heeded.46 Kant above all gives this advice because he thinks that to\nact without regard to morality is always wrong. As the sole representatives of\nrational nature upon the planet we owe it to ourselves to act according to principle.\nWe demean our status as rational beings when we overlook what principle requires.\nWe ought not to, and in so far as we are thinking beings we cannot, escape morality.\nBut for those who are not swayed by such ethical arguments (and they\ndemonstrate their inhumanity and insensitivity in not being moved by them) Kant\nis also prepared to advance supplementary and powerful arguments that draw upon\nthe worldly-wise person\u2019s measures of correctness \u2013 prudence and the likelihood of\nsuccess. Kant believes that politicians that act without regard for morality will\nultimately undermine themselves. Worldly-wise politicians attempt to base their\nstrategies on what best yields success in the world. Their measure of the quality of\na policy is its outcome. If the outcome is good the policy also is deemed good. But\nto achieve policies that bring success of this kind, knowledge of the world is\nrequired. We have to draw on experience to decide which policies suit us best.\nHowever, it is in the nature of experience, which conveys to us knowledge of the\nempirical world, that it can never be complete. New circumstances and instances\n40 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 20(1)\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \ncan always occur that may upset the ideas that we have previously held. To make\npolicies based on expediency alone always a success would require infinite know-\nledge: the knowledge that we as humans are denied.\nThose who stand most in the way of lasting peace are for Kant the \u2018moralizing\npoliticians\u2019 who take morality seriously only as a means of deceiving and\nmanipulating people:\nBy glossing over political principles contrary to right on the pretext that human\nnature is not capable of what is good in accord with that idea, as reason\nprescribes it, [they] make improvement impossible and perpetuate, as far as they\ncan, violations of right.47\nPolitical leadership is indeed a skill which requires prudence and knowledge of the\nworld, but it has to be a skill that is exercised in tandem with morality, otherwise\nthe skill will come to nothing. Unprincipled, artful politicians ultimately undermine\nthemselves and their societies.\nFrom the statesman\u2019s point of view there are two key aspects to successful\npolitical rule: the first involves the exercise of coercive power to implement policy\nand the second involves the consent of free subjects that can only be derived from\nmoral persuasion. A ruler can of course rely on the mechanisms of nature (e.g. fear,\ndesire for advantage and competition) to gain obedience in the last analysis. But this\nkind of compliance requires great material resources. The kind of compliance that\ncorresponds with our nature as free beings is one that accords with reason. The most\nimportant ingredient in the success of a policy is the respect of the subjects that have\nacquiesced in it and carry it out. In Kant\u2019s terms, policy based on expediency or\nutilitarian calculation depends excessively on the coercive mechanisms of the state.\nPoliticians who follow this line are engaged in a continuous gamble as to whether\nor not their policies work out. In failing to please their subjects they will lose their\nrespect and ultimately their support. Contrariwise, politicians who place due\nemphasis on doing the right thing, and so gaining the consent of their subjects, will\nnot lose their respect, even if the outcomes are not entirely what is anticipated. Seen\nfrom a Kantian perspective the more a people are convinced of the morality of a\npolicy the less a ruler has to depend on natural mechanisms to gain compliance. No\ndoubt rulers can always get by on force for some of the time, but if this becomes a\nnorm the more precarious will become their rule. So the uncertainty of an immoral\npolitics may of itself drive the leader who gives priority to strategic considerations\nto a moral policy.\nLasting success will come only to the political leaders who take theory seriously.\nTheir policies have to be framed in a consistent framework that only theory can\nprovide. And it is this framework that Kant seeks to provide in his political\nphilosophy and Perpetual Peace.\nIn the second supplement, concerning the coincidence between morality and\npolitics according to the transcendental concept of public right, Kant shows how\nmoral principles should properly be pursued in politics through leaders conforming\nBACK FROM THE USSR 41\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nto the idea of publicity. What the idea of publicity requires is that in order for a\npolicy to succeed the maxims underlying it have to be made public. Political leaders\nshould be able to express openly the overall strategy that lies behind any particular\nmeasure or action. When they do properly inform the public of their guiding aims,\nboth their own subjects and the world at large, there is no reason to believe that\npolitics and morality can come into conflict with one another.\nIt is interesting to observe that debates about the rightness of the war against Iraq\nin 2003\/4 have focused very heavily (this is certainly the case for Britain) on the\nquestion of publicity. The question of whether or not the public was properly\ninformed by the government of its underlying strategy and the information on\nwhich it was based has been at the heart of recent controversy about the legality and\nprudence of the war. There is a sense expressed by some commentators that the true\nmotives for the war have never been established and that the government may be\njustifiably open to criticism to the extent that it may appear to have something to\nhide.48 In the absence of information and a persuasive explanation of the action,\nspeculation has arisen that the ultimate grounds for the war may lie in a desire to\nsustain and spread western influence and power in a highly important strategic and\neconomic region. More imaginative explanations have also been offered, some\nrelating to a personal motivation that George W. Bush might have to take revenge\nfor the seeming humiliation of his father, George Bush, by the Iraqi regime in the\nearlier war, and a later alleged attempt to assassinate the former President and close\nfamily in Kuwait.49 In the nature of things there is little that can be done to disprove\nor prove these accounts, but Kant\u2019s recommendations about publicity might, had\nthey been followed, have led the parties concerned at least to reflect more fully on\ntheir underlying rationale for conducting the war. It is true that no one can know with\nabsolute certainty what their underlying motives in acting are, but without an attempt\nto formulate them and make them clear we cannot even approximate to that goal.\nKant argues that political leaders should always put their policies to the test\nagainst the principle of publicity. A political leader should never entertain a\nmeasure that is contrary to right or justice. The role of political leaders is to enforce\nlaw and so to encourage the public at large to abide by it. They should know the\nlaws of their country and those of international justice and not act contrary to them.\nAnd if they require to test whether or not a measure is acceptable, since not all\nmeasures can be covered by existing law, then Kant has this formula for them: \u2018All\nactions relating to the rights of others are wrong if their maxim is incompatible with\npublicity.\u201950 If the political leader is aware that for a policy to succeed its underlying\nmotive has to be kept quiet then this is sure enough proof that the policy is wrong:\nFor a maxim that I cannot divulge without thereby defeating my own purpose,\none that absolutely must be kept secret if it is to succeed and that I cannot\npublicly acknowledge without unavoidably arousing everyone\u2019s opposition to\nmy project, can have stirred up this necessary and general (hence a priori\nforeseeable) opposition against me because it is itself unjust and constitutes a\nthreat to everyone.51\n42 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 20(1)\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nTo be properly at ease with their own decisions political leaders have to ask\nthemselves whether or not they can be open about their rules of conduct in acting.\nKant added a second, secret, addendum to the second edition of Perpetual Peace\n(1796) that further strengthens the idea of publicity and highlights the contribution\nthat he himself might make to world peace. The secret addendum stipulates the\nprominent role that philosophers should play in politics: \u2018the maxims of the philoso-\nphers on the conditions under which public peace is possible shall be consulted by\nstates which are armed for war\u2019.52 It is perhaps odd that Kant should refer to this as\na secret addendum, after apparently condemning political leaders for not revealing\ntheir maxims in carrying out policies. But his purpose is both diplomatic and\nrhetorical. He wants politicians to feel free to follow the advice of philosophers\nwithout losing face with their subjects by appearing subordinate to others in their\nsociety.53 Unlike Marx, who famously argued \u2018that the philosophers have only\nvariously interpreted the world, the point is to change it\u2019,54 and so inadvertently\nimplied that politics had no need for armchair theorizing, Kant defends with vigour\nthe position of the academic. The academic should be allowed to speak openly\nwithout fear and be entitled to criticize the policies of leaders. Indeed, Kant stresses\nthat political and legal arrangements should be such that the intellectual and moral\nindependence of academics in the public expression of their ideas should be\nabsolute. How can we know if we are doing the right thing if there is no scope to\ndevelop an independent measure of truth and justice? How can political leaders\nknow if they are doing well or badly unless someone is by the nature of their\nprofession free to evaluate their actions? Free enquiry is the especial responsibility\nof philosophers. Philosophers should not rule, but their voices should be heard and\nbe fully taken into account in deliberating policy.55 Kant\u2019s greatest potential\ncontribution to world peace is arguably the example of free academic enquiry (over\nthe whole range of human knowledge and practice) that he showed.\nConclusion\nReflecting once again on the occasion that gave rise to this article \u2013 the bicentenary\nof Kant\u2019s death in Kaliningrad \u2013 it is apparent that the city\u2019s history itself is both a\nlesson about the consequences of the unplanned development of world politics,\nmoved by wars and ideological and political strife, and a lesson as to what might\nhave been gained if Kant\u2019s words had been more closely heeded by the world\u2019s\nleaders. The situation of Kaliningrad is salutary because whatever perspective one\nadopts none of the present parties involved can be wholly satisfied with the\nterritory\u2019s position and condition. Kaliningrad stands isolated on the coast of the\nBaltic Sea, itself a casualty of war. From the perspective of many German people,\nfor whom it was once part of their homeland, the present circumstances may seem\ndeeply disappointing. The city that was a proud part of their heritage no longer\nexists. From a Russian perspective things are just as unsatisfactory. Kaliningrad is\ncut off from the Russian Federation land mass by the Baltic states and Belarus. By\nBACK FROM THE USSR 43\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nfar the simplest way for a Russian to travel to Kaliningrad is now by air. The enclave\nis going to be difficult to sustain, and possibly even more so now that Poland and\nthe Baltic states are members of the European Union and so more open to western\ninfluence, trade and investment. The economic and social advantages of this\nwestern connection will become more apparent by the day.\nThus Kaliningrad\u2019s situation is sadly complicated, evidence of the catastrophes\nthat can be caused by war and evidence also of the dialectical way in which history\nworks to remind the human species of its weaknesses and its obligations. From\nKant\u2019s perspective it brings home what the consequences of the absence of moral\ntheory in the politics of nations can be. German foreign policy in the twentieth\ncentury followed a course that was diametrically opposed to the one that is outlined\nby Kant in his political writings. German leaders acted contrary to Preliminary\nArticle 1 in not entering into the accord ending the First World War in the proper\nspirit.56 No doubt this was made difficult for them by the punitive policies of the\nAllies, but dishonesty about rearmament and the preparation for future wars was not\nthe right way to counter it.57 Hitler broke Articles 2 and 5 in seeking to acquire and\nhold new territories. He professionalized and idolized the armed forces in\ncontravention to Preliminary Article 3 and built up its strength through an expanded\nnational debt contrary to Article 4. He interfered in an unprincipled way with the\nconstitutions of neighbouring states (Article 5) and in war he acted in a bestial and\nsavage way towards enemy states. German politics reflected an un-Kantian spirit in\nthe first half of the century by rejecting republicanism. Only with West Germany\u2019s\nadvent in the late 1940s did the nation embrace the second of the Definitive Articles\nin seeking to create and maintain a peaceful federation of states. Quite clearly also\nuntil 1945 the Nazi state showed hostility towards the nationals of many other states\n(and particularly those of a different racial descent).\nOf course the Soviet regime cannot be seen as entirely above blame for its\npolitics and foreign policy in the same period. Responding in kind to the imperialist\npolitics of the time they acquired territories not their own (in Poland and Finland\nfor example); interfered grossly with the constitutions of other states (Preliminary\nArticle 5); and used despicable tactics in war (the use of spies; encouraging atroc-\nities). Unlike Germany it might also still be criticized now for only half-heartedly\nembracing a republican constitution, and for failing to pay proper attention to the\npossibility of forming a peaceful federation opposed to war with other like-minded\nstates. For three decades or more both Germany and Russia experienced totalitarian\nregimes that would not allow the free public discussion of political and social\nissues. The dictatorial leaders of these regimes felt under no obligation to heed the\nSecret Article that Kant added to the second edition of Perpetual Peace calling for\nstate leaders actively to seek the advice of philosophers by encouraging the widest\npossible public discussion. Even though each of these regimes had their own class\nof philosophers they were bound to a rigid state orthodoxy that prevented them\nfrom giving any genuinely independent advice.58\nA different and better future for Kaliningrad will involve making good these\nmistakes and reversing the trends of the last century. Given Kant\u2019s perspective there\n44 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 20(1)\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nare two ways in which this improvement can be brought about. Political leaders can\ndo it consciously by adopting the framework he recommends and connecting it to\ndeveloping circumstances, or it can come about by default through the pressure of\nevents (the kind of reasoning he deploys in outlining the guarantee of perpetual\npeace). If progress can be said to have occurred up to now, arguably it can be said\nto have occurred more inadvertently through the second of these processes. Some\nimprovement has been forced upon Kaliningrad against the wills of its past and\npresent rulers \u2013 as for instance with its present advance from totalitarian rule. Given\nits experience over the last century few can seriously believe that the way forward\nfor Kaliningrad and its people lies through the use of military force. The way\nforward now lies through cooperation and consciously abiding by the rules outlined\nin Perpetual Peace. Although events up until now may have dealt Kaliningrad a bad\nhand, following Kant\u2019s view of history, the approach of its citizens and others\nconcerned about its future should not be fatalistic. Just as the disappointment of\nGermans at seeing the disappearance of part of their national heritage can be turned\nto advantage to encourage German interest and investment in the enclave, so the\ndeep desire of Russians to come forward economically can lead to a greater interest\nin the trading and commercial potential of Kaliningrad59 \u2013 now effectively land-\nlocked in the European Union. The Russian leaders can see they can only flourish\nin Kaliningrad if they nurture and stabilize their relations with the European Union.\nBoth German and Russian leaders are acutely conscious of their need to cooperate\nwith each other in the region. The two former enemies see that they can only over-\ncome the tragic past jointly.60 Both morality and expediency point to a republican,\nfederative and cosmopolitan solution to the problems of Kaliningrad.\nThese three dimensions: the republican, federative and cosmopolitan correspond\nto the three Definitive Articles of Kant\u2019s Perpetual Peace. The opportunity for\nrepublicanism is provided by the demise of the totalitarian Soviet state. The people\nof Kaliningrad should take advantage of their position as the most westerly of the\nRussian cities to institute a truly representative democratic form of government.\nThe opportunity for federalism is provided by Kaliningrad\u2019s position both within\nthe Russian Federation and on the borders of the European Union. Only through the\nrecognition of legal means as the proper manner for conducting relations with other\nRussian republics and with surrounding states can Kaliningrad thrive. Finally, the\nopportunity for cosmopolitanism is provided by the need for the people of\nKaliningrad to be treated with hospitality by their neighbours (to be given proper\naccess for travel and trade) newly admitted to the European Union and for them to\noffer hospitality to visitors from the West to open their economy. The success of\nKaliningrad might then become an emblem for the good sense of Kant\u2019s political\nand international theory.\nBACK FROM THE USSR 45\n at Open University Library on October 5, 2012ire.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nNotes\n1 This is a revised version of a paper given at a conference held in Kaliningrad State University on\n12\u201313 February 2004 marking the bicentenary of Kant\u2019s death on 12 February 1804.\n2 The book was first published in 1795 (Koenigsberg: Friedrich Nicolovius) with an enlarged second\nedition appearing in 1796.
