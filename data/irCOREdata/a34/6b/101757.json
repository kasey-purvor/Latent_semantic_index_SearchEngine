The article is inspired by, and draws substantially from \nLewis Carroll\u2019s `Hunting of the Snark\u2019. It employs a broadly systemic theoretical \nperspective.   \n \nThe article highlights relevant characteristics of Carroll\u2019s fiction and argues for the \nimportance of differentiation between orders of learning, following Bateson's (1973) \nmodel of levels of learning. Building on this differentiation of orders of learning, and \non the notion of the inevitable paradoxical nature of organizations, the article \nexplores a possible conceptual integration of `learning\u2019 and `politics\u2019, which Easterby-\nSmith et al (1999) consider desirable.  \n \nA question raised is of whether experiences cited as paradigmatic of `the learning \norganization\u2019 are most likely to be transient and emergent. The analysis questions \nthe extent to which such states can be produced through intention and design, and \ntherefore to what extent the wish for these to become permanent states may parallel \nthe hunt for the Snark.  \n \nKeywords: learning; learning organization; organizational learning; paradox; systems \ntheory; learning to learn. \n \n  2\nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe value of narrative and storytelling in practice contexts, and as subjects for \nresearch and theorising, is acknowledged (for example, Abma 2003; Gabriel 2000). \nWhat appears less common is the use of story, metaphor, imagination and the like in \nacademic writing (which might seem odd, given the emergence of postmodern views \nof knowledge). I refer to `The Hunting of the Snark' in this article in a spirit somewhat \nsimilar to that of the Sufi teaching story (Shah 1973, for example; and see Reason \nand Hawkins 1988), and that of use of stories in this field by authors such as \nWatzlawick (1986) and Weick (1994). The intention, in essence, is to offer a \nperspective, a way of seeing that asks `what if?\u2019, in order to stimulate thought and \ndialogue.  \n \nMy intent is to provide a potentially illuminative critique of some epistemological \ndimensions of the `learning organization' idea. Epistemology refers to the science of \n`knowing\u2019 (Bateson and Bateson 1988 p.20; see also Bateson 1991 pp. 215 \u2013 224). \nIn other words, I seek to question conceptions of, and presuppositions about, the \nnature of learning that may be embedded within discourses of `the learning \norganization\u2019.  \n \nThis is not intended to deride either the idea of the learning organization itself, or the \nendeavour of `hunting\u2019 \u2013 the idea has, among other things, stimulated much \nexperimentation in organizational settings (e.g. Garvin 1993, Burgoyne et al 1994, \namong others). My aim is to express an aesthetic insight into some of the \nepistemological issues, and to attempt some conceptual sense-making of this \nthrough systemic concepts, without trying to convert the aesthetic side wholly into \ncognitive theory.  \n \n \nON `THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK\u2019 \n \nWhy Lewis Carroll\u2019s `Hunting of the Snark\u2019? The poem is the story of ten characters \nwho set off on a voyage, organised and led by a character called the Bellman, in \nsearch of a fabulous creature, the Snark. Carroll wrote `The Hunting of the Snark\u2019 in \n1876 (Gardner in Carroll 1974 p.16). Apparently he conceived of it whilst walking in \nGuildford (where the University of Surrey is located). It is described by the \nEncyclopedia Britannica as `nonsense literature of the highest order\u2019, yet it seems \n  3\nmuch more than a piece of whimsy. Martin Gardner mentions the view that the poem, \nsubtitled `An Agony in Eight Fits\u2019, is ` a poem about being and non-being\u2026a poem of \nexistential agony\u2019 (Gardner, in Carroll 1974 p.28). \n \nInitially, when reflecting on personal experience of organizational events in 2000, I \nwas struck by the potential of the dream-like voyage of fancy on which Carroll\u2019s \ncharacters embarked as an allegory of the quest for the learning organization. Pure \nallegory has limitations. Through writing and developing the article I came to view the \npoem more as a paradigm of the consequences of human desire for, and efforts at, \nprogress through the striving for ideals. In other words the poem expresses \nsomething about our `hunting\u2019. In this respect it may represent a mythological themei, \na profound metaphor more than a mere cautionary moral tale.  \n \nVarious lines of inquiry could open up from this point. Here I confine myself to three \nmain imaginative insights: \n \n1. The idea of `the Learning Organisation\u2019 can be regarded as a Snark. The Snark \nis a fabulous creature; the probable existence and location of the Snark are \nasserted by the Bellman (`what I tell you three times is true\u2019ii) although there is no \nhard evidence. In similar fashion we have been exhorted to search for `the \nlearning organization\u2019. There is value in the `hunting\u2019; nevertheless the Snark \nitself is illusory. \n2. The revelation that the Snark is a Boojumiii resonates with the idea that, while \nlearning appears to be regarded as universally good and beneficial, there is a \n`shadow\u2019 side to `the learning organization\u2019. For example, it seems essential to \nregard learning as being regulated in organizations. This opens the possibility \nthat we can see learning as interwoven with power and politics, such that politics \nis considered as neither separate from, nor a barrier to, learning.  \n3. The paradoxical nature of organizational life is central; there appears to operate, \nfor example, an equivalent of the Bellman\u2019s `Rule 42\u2019iv. Through pursuit of \nlearning and learning to learn, we may miss the necessity of (as it were) learning \nnot to learn.  \n \nI address each of the above themes in turn, relating these to relevant literature in the \nfield. For a conceptual framework I draw on systems thinking, particularly the work of \nBateson (1973, 1979, 1991), Keeney (1983), and Watzlawick et al (1974). These \nshare a view that human systems are essentially recursive. They operate in an \n  4\n`arational\u2019 manner, neither with a linear, logical rationality, nor with irrationality. This \nis reflected in aphorisms such as `plus ca change, plus c\u2019est la meme chose\u2019 \n(Watzlawick et al 1974 p.1). From this perspective the logic of the operation of \nhuman systems resembles that found in Lewis Carroll\u2019s work. Bateson, for example, \nemphasises paradoxical thinking and circular causality (for example, Bateson and \nBateson 1988 p. 143). The paradoxical nature of organisational life is also addressed \nin other literature in this field (for example, Weick 1994, Antonacopolou 1999, 2001, \nLewis 2000).  \n \n \nWHAT I TELL YOU THREE TIMES IS TRUE \n \nSince the late 1980\u2019s, businesses and all others kinds of organisation have been \nexhorted to become learning organizations. Pedler et al (1989 p.1) report seeing the \nterm learning organization in a Foundation for Management Education document in \n1987, and say, presciently, `this theme is the one most likely to preoccupy managers \nin the next few years\u2019. Since then, the desirability of becoming a learning organization \nseems to have won widespread acceptance. \n \nIncidentally, Carroll chose names beginning with `B\u2019 for all the characters (Bellman, \nBaker, Banker, Barrister, Beaver, Billiard-Maker, Bonnet-Maker, Boots, Broker and \nButcher), plus two monsters (the Bandersnatch and the Boojum). It may be a trivial \npoint, but it does seem a pity that those prominent UK authors in this field, Pedler, \nBurgoyne and Boydell, so narrowly miss perfecting this theme. \n \nMight we see texts such as Pedler et al (1991), Senge (1990) and Watkins and \nMarsick (1993) as equivalent to the Bellman\u2019s rallying cry? We have been told three \ntimes (and more) that the learning organization is the answer, we have accepted that \nthis must be true, and we have hunted high and low.  \n \nLooking through the literature, I am struck by how common it is for authors to take \ncare to deny that they are pursuing the `learning organization' as a goal, to assert \nthat it is unattainable, and to describe it as a vision (Senge et al 1994 pp. 5 - 6) or an \naspiration (`The Learning Organization is more of a continuing aspiration than a \nproduct', Garratt 2000 p.x). Nevertheless, the language of voyages is noticeable. For \nexample, in a special retrospective issue of The Learning Organization journal (`The \nlearning organization: ten years on'), three of the four articles include explicitly the \n  5\nterm `journey' (Garratt 1999; Marsick & Watkins 1999; Smith 1999). There seems \nlittle doubt that these authors at least seek to enthuse their readers to join the \nvoyage. \n \nThe quest for the learning organization, perhaps especially as its existence is \ntypically denied, appears mythic, a voyage in search of some symbolic or fabled goal. \nGrey (1998) notes that the learning organization has actually been described as `the \nholy grail\u2019, a magical solution to the problems facing businesses, resonant perhaps of \nthe existential angst that Gardner perceives in the poem. Marsick and Watkins recall \nthat in their early workshops `we would talk about the fact that, in some ways, the \nlearning organization represented all of our collective best wishes for Utopia in the \nworkplace' (1999 p.207). Elkjaer (2001) describes a case in an article, using the \nsubtitle `an undelivered promise\u2019. In Senge's writing, it is a journey in search of the \nexperience of being a member of `a \"great team\"\u2026 we probably remember the trust, \nthe relationships, the acceptance, the synergy\u2026' (Senge et al 1994 p. 17). Garvin \n(1993) remarks on the `near mystical terminology' of authors such as Sengev. \n \nA question raised in this article is whether experiences such as that invoked by \nSenge are more likely to be transient and emergent than routine or permanent. While \nthe desire to create such experiences is understandable, the implication that these \ncould become a permanent state of organization may be the more illusory aspect. \nThe analysis offered here also questions the extent to which such states can be \nproduced through intention and design.  \n \nSome literature attempts to define characteristics or measures by which the learning \norganization may be identified, as in the briefing the Bellman gave his crewvi. These \nincluded, notably, Pedler et al\u2019s (1991) eleven characteristics of the learning \ncompany. There are frequent attempts to measure the ephemeral quality of `learning' \nthrough the extent of overt activity such as training, a relationship which \nAntonacopoulou (2001) argues is vastly oversimplified.  \n \nIn the poem, the Bellman\u2019s chart is, delightfully, entirely blank. This was much \nappreciated by the crew, who found it `a map they could all understand\u2019. It is \ntempting to appreciate the Bellman\u2019s stance here, particularly when contemplating \nthe plethora of programmes and models purporting to guide us to the learning \norganization. At the very least, the small print accompanying sale of these artefacts \nmight cite Korzybski\u2019s dictum (`the map is not the territory\u2019 \u2013 Korzybski 1933, cited in \n  6\nBandler and Grinder 1975 p.7), and refer to Weick (1994) (the point of a map is less \naccurate representation than mobilisation of action). \n  \nIn their pursuit of the Snark, the voyagers `sought it with thimbles, they sought it with \ncare; they pursued it with forks and hope\u2019 (Carroll 1974 p. 73). There is a view that \nsome literature in the field employs hope rather than the critical probing of forks. \nHowever I want to resist, for the specific purposes of this article, suggesting that the \nformer genre (often described as prescriptive and unproblematic, e.g. see \u00d6rtenblad \n2002 p. 214) is necessarily inferior to critical, academic literature (e.g. Coopey 1995, \nDovey 1997)vii. It seems it is not only the `unproblematic\u2019 literature that subscribes to \nthe `journey' metaphor, whether explicitly or through construing the learning \norganization as a developmental project. \n \n \nFOR THE SNARK WAS A BOOJUM\u2026 \n \nA theme that I see represented very little in literatures of the learning organization is \nthe possibility that `learning\u2019 has a shadow sideviii. \n \nGrey (1998) argues that portraying learning as necessarily `a good thing\u2019 for an \norganization is patent nonsense. It is like saying that water is good for health, so the \nmore water we drink the better. Even though essential for life, water is only good for \nhealth up to a point and it is possible to die through drinking too much waterix. \nKeeney (1983 p.14), among others, comments on the epistemological flaws of the \nprinciple that `more is better'. He, like authors such as Bateson (1973, 1979, 1991) \nand Watzlawick et al (1974) prefer a more systemic `logic' that works with \noptimisation and self-regulatory limits rather than maximisation, and considers the \nunintended consequences of `good ideas\u2019.  \n \nSo, what if `learning\u2019 is in principle as likely to be harmful or unpalatable to \norganisations as it is likely to be beneficial or attractive? Just as Gabriel (2000 p. 5) \ncomments that `not all stories are good stories', do we also need to consider that not \nall learning is `good' learning?  \n \nCertainly, much literature suggests that too little learning will be disastrous for \ncompetitive success, often invoking or citing Reg Revans `formula', L \u2265 C, such that \n`an organization's rate of learning should be equal to, or greater than, the rate of \n  7\nchange in their environment' (Garratt 2000 p.2). What the literature appears to \nneglect is the question of whether one can have `too much of a good thing'. Similarly, \nit seems that very few authors surface the idea that learning itself may have \nunintended as well as intended, and undesirable as well as a desirable faces.  \n \nThis is reminiscent of Oscar Wilde's aphorism that  `In this world there are two \ntragedies. One is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it. The last is \nmuch the worst.'x To jump ahead to the ending of Carroll\u2019s story for a moment, a \nmember of the crew, the baker, does find a creature on the island. It is not, however, \nthe longed-for, benign Snark; `For the Snark was a Boojum, you see\u2019 (Carroll, L. in \nGardner 1974 p.96). The baker is never seen again. I wonder sometimes whether in \npractice we also hold a tacit awareness that `the Snark is a Boojum\u2019; that if we are \nsuccessful we will not like what we find, and so voyage towards the learning \norganization as well as conspiring to avoid encountering it?  \n \nTaking a reported incident from practicexi, a multinational company intending to \ndevelop itself as a learning organization ran programmes to encourage managers to \nchallenge received wisdom and to take an inquiring approach. Later, one participant \nattended an awayday, where the managing director of his division circulated among \nstaff over dinner. The participant raised a question about the approach the MD had \ntaken on a particular project; with hindsight, had that been the best strategy? `That \nwas the way I did it\u2019, said the MD. `But do you think there was a better way?\u2019, asked \nthe participant. `I don\u2019t think you heard me\u2019, replied the MD. `That was the way I did \nit\u2019. `That I heard\u2019, continued the participant, `but might there have been a better \nway?\u2019. The MD fixed his gaze on the participants\u2019 lapel badge, then looked him in the \neye, saying coldly, `I will remember your name\u2019, before walking away.     \n \nAt first glance this example appears to be in direct contradiction to the espoused aim \nof becoming a learning organization. As we know from Argyris (1999)  espoused \ntheory and theory in use do not usually coincide; and questioning managerial \nhegemony is often outside the boundary of what managers may consider `useful\u2019 \ninquiry. Elkjaer (2001 p.445) notes the way `learning organization' programmes can \nappear to be about socialization. So I doubt that anyone reading about this incident \nwould be surprised by itxii.  \n \nIn Argyris\u2019 terms, the MD seems to have demonstrated `Model I\u2019 behaviour through a \ndefensive routine (Argyris 1999 p.58), apparently making the issue `undiscussable\u2019 \n  8\n(e.g. Argyris 1999 p.141). His response seems likely to militate against the second-\norder change (Watzlawick et al 1974) the company appears to be seeking. The \nparticipant presumably feels he has received mixed messages (Argyris 1999 p93), \nperhaps being placed in a form of double bind (Bateson 1973 p.242) in which he is \nsimultaneously exhorted to put `learning organization\u2019 principles into practice, and \npunished for doing so. If he concludes that he is not to challenge senior managers he \nmay develop what Argyris calls skilled incompetence (1999 pp. 139 \u2013 148).  \n \nHowever, surely some learning has taken place? For our hapless participant, like the \nbaker in pursuit of the Snark of an inquiring, learning organization, I can think of no \nbetter term than `Boojum\u2019 for the MD\u2019s response. Nor do I suggest that the MD's \nresponse was helping to create a `learning organization'. But I do suggest that the \nMD's response triggered learning about learning in that organization.  \n \nTypically, according to Easterby-Smith et al (1999) the literature in this field typically \nsplits learning from politics, noting that Coopey is unusual in that he regards politics \nas a natural feature of organizational process; `The idea of organizational learning as \na political process is touched upon by many\u2026 but from the perspective that this is a \npersistent problem which needs to be overcome and nullified if learning is to take \nplace\u2019 (Easterby-Smith et al 1999 p.5). Thus Senge (1990) regards politics as an \nimpediment to learning, and suggests that individual and interpersonal skills are the \nmeans to overcome limitations in the context. Similarly, Argyris, as Easterby-Smith et \nal (1999) point out, implicitly treats politics as a barrier to learning. These positions \nappear to commit the epistemological error (Bateson 1973 pp. 280 - 308xiii) of pitting \none part of the system against another.  \n \nAnother tendency in the literature is that of regarding `learning to learn' as highly \ndesirable (e.g. Garratt 1999 p. 203). It may be equally important to `learn not to \nlearn'. The participant, perhaps naively in retrospect, took literally the encouragement \nto pursue inquiry. He learnt, as it were, at a contextual level. This may be seen as a \nkind of meta-learning, about when to display the behaviour the organization appears \nto want, and when not do so.  \n \nTherefore one can argue about whether, in this particular instance, the MD's \nresponse was likely to serve the organization's declared interests; but the type of \nbehaviour the MD was displaying, ostensibly interfering with learning, is unavoidably \npart of learning in organizations. \n  9\n \nWhat if we were to see this `shadow side\u2019 of learning within a wider picture, as an \nintegral component of learning in organizations? The implication is that we might \nconnote apparent `non-learning\u2019 positivelyxiv and, in common with many systemic \nmodels (e.g. the presuppositions of Neuro-Linguistic Programming \u2013 Dilts 1998), to \nregard apparently troublesome patterns of behaviour as skilled accomplishments. So \ninstead of concluding that people\u2019s skills at learning are somehow deficient (ie if we \nwere only better at it, or could remove the barriers, we could create learning \norganizations), it opens the possibility that their skills are already exquisite, if seen \nthrough an alternative frame.  \n \nIn other words, we might regard the tacit, informal strategies for regulating learning in \nthis way, which many refer to as `politics' and thus connote negatively, as skilled and \nsophisticated \u2013 as a form of `learning to learn\u2019. It appears that individuals need this \ntype of skill in order to participate. Indeed, it seems that it is only by adopting a \ncompletely decontextualised concept of `learning' that learning can be regarded as \nnecessarily `good\u2019, and separate from politics. To further that exploration, I will \ndiscuss paradoxicality through an intriguing and, at first glance, incidental feature of \n`The Hunting of the Snark', that of Rule 42.  \n \n \nRULE 42: THE UTILITY OF SAILING BACKWARDS \n \nOne of our doctoral students, an experienced counsellor and facilitator who works in \norganisations as a professional supervisor, perceives a significant degree of `parallel \nprocess\u2019xv between issues he encounters in supervision sessions, and organizational \nproblems or dynamics. In other words, in his experience the content, process and \nrelationships in supervision appear to be an unconscious re-enactment or reflection \nof aspects of organizational functioning. \n \nThis phenomenon might appear to represent a wonderful opportunity for \norganizational learning, for `joining up\u2019 individual experience and organisational \nissues. A supervision session presents live, relevant organisational material. Would \nthis not create the possibility of collective learning? What is curious is that this \nopportunity seems carefully avoided. Specifically, it does not appear to be considered \na legitimate activity to explore the individual\u2019s symptoms as the effects of the context \nof the organizational culture or structure. This may reflect a prominent dynamic in \n  10\norganizations, the individualising and psychologising (Salaman 1979 p.202) of \norganizational, systemic or structural problems.  \n \nIt is as if the organizational equivalent of the Bellman\u2019s Rule 42 is operating, perhaps \nformulated as; the organization shall not speak to the supervision, and the \nsupervision shall not speak to the organization. This acts as if to interrupt the \nfeedback loop from individual experience to organizational issuesxvi.  \n \nIs there, though, a logic to this paradoxical rule? For example, in relation to Alex\u2019s \nquestions, the apparently irrational disconnection between individual supervision and \norganizational learning enables managers to be seen to have taken action, and gives \na rationale for defining these problems as belonging elsewhere therefore needing no \nfurther action. It also enables employees to keep issues raised in supervision \n`private\u2019, as to disclose them outside supervision could result in embarrassment and \nridicule \n \nIn addition, it may well be useful in organizations for the ship to sail backwards from \ntime to time. We live an age of `hero managers\u2019 (Collins 1998) who are assumed to \nbe in control. With reference to Bateson\u2019s concept of conscious purpose (Bateson \n1973 p.410), the more people try to engineer the future or the state of the `ecology' of \nany system, the more they are likely to interfere with it and generate unintended, \npotentially harmful consequences. Sailing backwards gives a different perspective, \nand perhaps allows more for serendipity. If we rely on intentional action by managers \nwe might make little progress. We need the accidental, the spontaneous, and the \narational, for the emergence of noveltyxvii. \n \nThere is also another layer of paradox, which is that naming Rule 42 is itself likely to \nbe treated as a violation of Rule 42. In Argyris\u2019 terms (1999 p.141), the existence of \nRule 42 is itself undiscussable, and its undiscussability is undiscussable. In Alex\u2019s \nsupervision example, it would be interesting to observe what would happen if \nmanagers and employees began to discuss the advantages they gain from this \napparent Rule 42. For the participant in the earlier incident to have accused the MD \nof not allowing inquiry could have invited still more sanctions.  \n \n \nCONCEPTUALISING PARADOX: ORDERS OF LEARNING \n \n  11\nAt first glance we might regard Rule 42 as an absurdity, as dysfunctional and as \nsomething to overcome. I want to entertain the possibility, however, that Rule 42 \nrepresents another significant part of the picture. That is, that Rule 42 is a kind of \n`meta-principle\u2019, an epistemological position about how we regard paradoxes and \ndilemmas.  \n \nConceptualising this introduces further difficulties as it invokes the very self-\nreferential nature of language and thought that it is attempting to describe. This is \none possible reason for taking an aesthetic rather than a cognitive approach. Here I \nwill at least sketch a way in which Bateson\u2019s model of `levels of learning\u2019 may assist, \nwithout abandoning an aesthetic apprehension of this territory (as Bateson \nadvocates), or the experiential, emotional dimension of paradox.  \n \nParadox and contradiction inevitably arise in communication. For example, \ncommunication has both `content' and `relationship' dimensions. As Bateson \nshowed, words often carry the `content' message whilst paralinguistic or non-verbal \naspects often carry the `relationship' messagexviii. Bateson's work on schizophrenia \n(1973 pp. 215 - 241) argues that double binds can be created where content and \nrelationship messages are contradictory. Again, this is what appears to have \nhappened to the participant in the earlier example. There was some explicit content \nsaying `question what happens here'. The MD's behaviour contradicted this, in effect \nsaying `don\u2019t you dare question my actions'. The participant was in a double bind in \nthe sense that obeying either of these instructions would mean disobeying the other. \n \nBateson\u2019s theory of levels of learning (1973 pp 250 - 279) developed from Russell \nand Whitehead\u2019s theory of logical types, which aimed to account for logical \nparadoxesxix. As Flemons explains it: \n \n`Russell's Theory of Logical Types distinguishes between levels of abstraction. \nOriginally invented as a way of eschewing paradox in the world of logic, the notion of \nlogical types is used by Bateson as a way of charting the classification inherent in all \nperceiving, thinking, learning, and communicating. A class is a different logical type, \na higher level of abstraction, than the members it classifies: The class of \"all books\" \nis not itself a book; the name of a thing is itself not a thing, but a classification of it... \nThis hierarchy of types - classes, classes of classes, classes of classes of classes, \nand so on - provides a convenient bridge to the critical notion of context and the \ninterdependence of wholes and parts. The notion of levels makes clear that learning, \n  12\nfor example, is a contextual affair; one not only learns, but simultaneously learns how \nto learn.\u2019 (Flemons 1991 p.5-6) \n \nIt is this latter point that may help here. Specifically, it is the idea that any act of \nlearning in organizations necessarily entails simultaneous layers of `learning\u2019xx \n(equating to Bateson\u2019s `Learning I\u2019, or LI) and `learning to learn\u2019 (LII); and that \n`learning to learn\u2019, as Flemons indicates, is a contextual affair.  \n \nWhat did Bateson mean by `context\u2019? His definitions of LII emphasise changes in \nsensitivity to the context (`changes in the manner in which the stream of action and \nexperience is segmented or punctuated into contexts together with changes in the \nuse of context markers', 1973 p.264). So LII refers to learning about the context: `I \nassume that in any learning experiment\u2026 there occurs not only that learning in which \nthe experimenter is usually interested\u2026 but also a more abstract or higher order of \nlearning, in which the experimental subject improves his ability to deal with contexts \nof a given type. The subject comes to act more and more as if contexts of this type \nwere expectable in his universe' (Bateson 1991 pp. 53 - 54). In summary, `what is \nlearned in Learning II is a way of punctuating events.\u2019 (Bateson 1973 p.271: italics in \noriginal). \n \nI take Bateson\u2019s definition of `learning to learn\u2019 to embrace both higher-order \ncharacteristics of the `problem\u2019 being solved, and the social or relational context and \nits `rules\u2019. Bateson (1973 p.271) gives transference as an example of LII, in that it \nconcerns patterns of behaviour learnt (introjected) at an early age which a person \nreproduces when in similar contexts later in life.  \n \nSnyder\u2019s (1971) notion of the `hidden curriculum' may be another example of LII, in \nthat this concept expresses the idea that every educational experience has an overt \ncurriculum (stated learning aims, activities and so on), and a hidden curriculum, or \nwhat is taught tacitly. Students simultaneously learn from the overt curriculum, and \n`learn to learn\u2019, so becoming socialised into the practices and expectations of the \nparticular educational setting. French and Bazalgette (1996), drawing explicitly on \nBateson\u2019s work, have drawn attention nicely to this more tacit, contextual, learning to \nlearn through their notion of the `teaching-learning\u2019 organization. It seems that this \nconception of LII may also be compatible with Lave and Wenger's (1991) emphasis \non learning being a facet of participation in communities of practice (see also \nGherardi et al 1998). As Lave concludes from a study of West African tailors\u2019 \n  13\napprenticeship (1996 p.155), `it was not just the informal side of life that was \nintricately context-embedded and situated activity: there is nothing else'. If, therefore,  \na decontextualised concept of learning is unrealistic, it is LII that may be regarded as \nconcerned with continuous learning about participation.  \n \nBateson called LII `deutero-learning', and also referred to it as `learning to learn' \n(1973 p. 263)xxi. It is worth noting that `learning to learn' is used typically in different \nsenses. Often it refers to improvements in skills of learning; equating perhaps to \nimproving study skills, or learning about one's learning style, or learning to use \nlearning contracts. At other times this term refers to double loop learning (which is \ndifferent from deutero-learning \u2013 see Argyris and Sch\u00f6n 1978), denoting a more \nstrategic kind of thinking that questions and seeks to correct the norms or goals of \naction.  \n \nThe suggestions here are that: \n \na) LI and LII necessarily co-exist in organizational settings.  \nb) LII can be thought of as concerning `politics\u2019, at least in so far as it concerns \nlearning about rules and norms of the context.  \nc) There is a hierarchical and recursive relationship between these putative levels, \nsuch that changes at LII will organize and influence (not determine) what is \npossible at LI. The contextual level serves to legitimise, limit, encourage or \ndiscourage learning at LI.  \nd) The recursive aspect means that influence flows not only from LII to LI, but also \nback in the other direction. (It seems crucial to regard the contextual `rules of \nparticipation\u2019 as emergent, not as set by some superordinate authority). \ne) These `rules of participation\u2019 are communicated through relationship more than \ncontent; there is often conflict between overt, stated, formal rules and those \nenacted.  \nf) A fundamental facet of organizational life involves experiencing and managing \nthe dilemmas and paradoxes arising from contradictions between content and \nrelationship messages. \n \nThis kind of differentiation between levels of learning may shed some further light on \nAntonacopoulou\u2019s (2001) empirical finding of a paradoxical relationship between \n`training\u2019 and `learning\u2019. Antonacopoulou explains that, whilst `the association \nbetween training and learning is still presented as a very potent one\u2019 (2001 p. 327), \n  14\nthis does not necessarily match individuals\u2019 perceptions based on their experience. \nShe cites interview data that show how managers both affirm the purported \nrelationship between training and learning, and deny that it exists in their experience.  \n \nAs Antonacopoulou acknowledges, these manager appear to face dilemmas (`the \ndilemma facing the individual is that of truthfulness and honesty with the self and \nothers\u2019, 2001 p.331; `In the light of the continuously changing priorities of the \norganization, managers feel more disorientated about what the organization expects \nand what they need to do in order to be successful\u2019, 2001 p.336). In practice, she \nsuggests, `the organizational priorities supersede those of the individual manager\u2019 \n(2001 p.336). \n \nThe data appear on the surface to demonstrate inconsistent or irrational thinking by \nindividuals (nb Antonacopoulou does not suggest that this is so) . Yet it may reflect \ninstead a tacit awareness of, and ability to manage, different levels of discourse in \norganizational life.  \n \nIf we adopt Bateson\u2019s model, these responses (see also p.337) can be thought of as \nreflecting two different levels of discourse, which Antonacopoulou characterises as \ntheoretical and operational. In short, managers have learnt (LII) the contextual rule \nthat training is regarded as a learning opportunity; yet also acknowledge that in their \npersonal experience (LI), training does not necessarily lead to learning. These \nstatements only create a paradox if we take training\/learning (LII) as identical to \ntraining\/learning (LI).  \n \nInsert Table 1 here \n \nWhat is of especial interest here is Antonacopoulou\u2019s comment that these managers \napparently find this paradox `not unusual and accept it as part of life\u2019 (2001 p.339). \nTo say that managers find it normal opens a variety of possible interpretations. It \ncould mean that these managers collude not to notice it, or it could signify that \nmanagers are aware of the paradoxical nature of organizational existence, so they do \nnot attempt to rationalise something that cannot be rationalised. Antonacopoulou\u2019s \narticle suggest that managers see this kind of dilemma as `politics\u2019: `For example, \nmanagers perceive training as a key to their career progression and try to play by the \nrules of the political game (maintain their self-image against admitting ignorance)\u2019 \n  15\n(2001 p.336). Conceptually, we might consider managers\u2019 ability to handle such \ndilemmas as an example of deutero-learning.  \n \nThis line of inquiry may indicate a case for conceiving of a further, reflexive layer that \nconcerns how to regard and manage paradoxes. In the Snark, this layer is made \nexplicit within Rule 42 (\"No one shall speak to the Man at the Helm,\" had been \ncompleted by the Bellman himself with the words \"and the Man at the Helm shall \nspeak to no one.\" So remonstrance was impossible\u2026). In organizational life, this kind \nof `meta-principle\u2019 seems likely to remain tacit. As a concept, it seems related to \nArgyris\u2019 idea of `Model I and II\u2019, perhaps also Wijnhoven\u2019s learning prototypes \n(Wijnhoven 2001) and the differences between Torbert\u2019s developmental stages \n(Fisher et al 2001). Changing such `meta-principles\u2019 would (in Bateson\u2019s framework) \ninvolve LIII (1973 p. 264), which might be expressed as `learning about {learning to \nlearn}\u2019. It is questionable to what extent such `meta-principles\u2019 are susceptible to \nintentional change.  \n \nIn summary, utilising Bateson\u2019s theory, perhaps three qualitatively different orders \ncan be mapped out. These operate as-if synchronous and interrelated, \ncorresponding to the levels Bateson labelled Learning I, II and III. I refer to these \nthree levels here as `product\/process\u2019, `contextual rules\u2019 and `meta-principle'xxii.  \n \nInsert table 2 here \n \nThe application of Bateson\u2019s levels of learning to the fields of the learning \norganization and organizational learning (primarily the latter, and I acknowledge that I \nam migrating between these literatures here) forms the basis of Argyris\u2019 work on \nsingle and double loop learning (e.g. Argyris 1999). However it appears that much \nliterature steers us towards a cognitive treatment of these issues. Argyris\u2019 own work \nhas a strongly cognitive emphasis. Some authors, such as Garratt (2000), whose \n`three learning cycles' model is based explicitly on the thinking of Watzalwick and \nArgyris, do this by emphasising strategic thinking. Others, such as Jankowicz (2002), \noffer a strongly cognitive application of Bateson\u2019s levels.  \n \nOther authors reject the cognitive approach to paradoxes and dilemmas and seek to \nretain the experiential, participatory dimension. One of these is Bill Torbert, whose \n`action inquiry\u2019 was influenced by his studies with Argyris, but who developed a much \nmore subject-centred perspective (e.g. Torbert 1991; Fisher and Torbert 1995). \n  16\n \nIt seems that a cognitive-rational trajectory loses touch with the `existential agony\u2019 of \nthe hunting. Both Bateson and Stacey  (Stacey et al 2000 pp. 205 - 206) argue for a \nparticipatory view of the world. Actors (such as managers) are participants, and can \nneither stand outside the system, nor control it. Among other things, this means that \nwe cannot treat paradoxes in organizational life as abstract, cognitive puzzles. They \nare embedded in interaction. We inhabit them, we feel the emotional tension of \ndilemmas, we cannot take `time out\u2019 to go away and consider a solution, and our \nresponses carry real consequences and risks. It may be that such dilemmas hold \nespecially rich possibilities for learning if they can be made subject to inquiry.  \n \nIn summary, a model such as Bateson\u2019s levels of learning may help us to \nconceptualise paradox and to regard it as a normal condition of organizational life. \nYet the cognitive emphasis of some authors who have built upon Bateson\u2019s model \nseems to neglect the experiential and existential dimension of an aesthetic \napprehension of these issues, as represented by Carroll\u2019s poem.   \n \n \nTHE BEAVER'S LESSON \n \nAs a final main section, I return briefly to questions of transience and intentionality.   \n \nArgyris is convinced that changing individuals is the key to changing the organization \n(`The moment one focuses on double-loop learning the individual becomes the basic \nsocial structure, and supra-structures cannot be changed without beginning at the \nindividual\u2019. Argyris 1999 p.89). Thus he proposes uncompromisingly that it is \nnecessary to change individual behaviour in order to change the system. At the same \ntime, Argyris acknowledges the extreme difficulty of escaping Model I (`because \npeople have been socialized to produce Model I and because the world continues to \noperate largely according to Model I even when some people try to act according to \nModel II\u2019, Argyris 1999 p.245). \n \nIn Fit the Fifth of the Hunting of the Snark (`The Beaver\u2019s Lesson\u2019) the Butcher and \nthe Beaver share an ordeal, an encounter with the Jubjub bird. This cements a \nfriendship all the more remarkable for the fact that at the outset, the Butcher had \ndeclared that he could `only kill beavers\u2019. \n \n  17\nI observed earlier that sources using the `journey' metaphor appear to be searching \nfor paradigmatic, partially idealised states (Snarks). A stimulus for this article was my \ndepartment\u2019s experience of a national Higher Education Subject Review (in 2000). \nThe process of preparing for the event itself, with staff working increasingly long \nhours towards the same goal, generated considerable `team spirit\u2019, and seemed set \naside many previously existing barriers to collective endeavour. More people were \nable to question more, and in each others\u2019 presence, than usual. The purposes, \nvalues and methods we took for granted in day-to-day working now became more \nopen to inquiry. There was outer success (in our case, scoring 23 out of 24 in the \nSubject Review).  \n \nIt was as if, during preparation for Subject Review, Rule 42 had become suspended \nor modified temporarilyxxiii. In other words, the `meta-principle\u2019 for how we dealt with \ndilemmas and paradoxes appeared to loosen, at least enough to enable what I and \nothers experienced as greater scope for inquiring.  \n \nOne of the responses in our department was to ask `why can\u2019t we work like that all \nthe time?\u2019. Recalling Senge, the episode seemed to become idealised as what things \ncould or should be like routinely. Some identified the barriers to this as (for example) \nthe way that people normally `looking after their own narrow interests\u2019, or `fail to \ncollaborate enough\u2019.   \n \nThe question this might raise is to what extent such collaboration is emergent from, \nrather than the source of, such experiences. The apparent changes in behaviour \nfrom our Subject Review process appeared (to me) to subside when that the \nparticular context no longer pertained. This led me to wonder to what extent the \nreasons were contextual, not intra- or interpersonal. What if such episodes are \ntypically transient and emergent? What if they are created less through programmes \nor enhancements in `learning disciplines\u2019 (Senge 1990) than through changes in the \ncontext, changes that may often be quite serendipitous, as for the Butcher and the \nBeaver? \n \nTherefore, as a final question to the epistemology of the `learning organization\u2019, I \nwonder to what Senge and others bring their own `meta-principles\u2019 to bear. Whilst an \nanalysis of such `meta-principles\u2019 is beyond the scope of the present paper, one \nmight expect them to be culturally sourced and not consciously selected. In this case, \nfor example, it might be represented by bringing a typically Western, rational \n  18\nperspective to the concept, seeking laws, formulae and methods through which such \nstates can be recreated intentionallyxxiv. Alternative cultural perspectives may \nembody quite distinct epistemological assumptions. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThis piece has suggested that the idea of the `learning organization\u2019 is, \nmetaphorically, a Snark; the Snark is a Boojum, in that learning is not a universal \ngood; and that organizational life has a paradoxical nature, illustrated by Rule 42.  \n \nThe hunt for the `learning organization' has mobilised much action and \nexperimentation. Interesting issues lie in the epistemology of such an approach, and \nembedded within the apparent nonsense of Lewis Carroll\u2019s `Hunting of the Snark\u2019, \nmay be a deeply wise metaphor of human efforts to attain ideals through \n`engineering' social improvements.  \n \nUsing Bateson\u2019s levels of learning, enhancing learning (LI) necessarily engages us in \nlearning how to learn in that context (LII), and also in learning how to manage \nparadox (LIII). Such a perspective may provide one way to reconcile `politics\u2019 and \n`learning\u2019. The value of an aesthetic apprehension of these issues to complement \ncognitive analyses has been emphasised.  \n \nNo doubt you have anticipated the ending. I am not optimistic for the future of the \nlearning organization as an idea, as I perceive that it is softly and silently vanishing \naway. There will be other Snarks to hunt, of course; however, every Snark will turn \nout to be a Boojum. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nI wish to thank all colleagues (staff and doctoral students) who have read and \ncommented on this article.

I have said it twice: \nThat alone should encourage the crew. \nJust the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice: \nWhat I tell you three times is true.' (Carroll, L. 1974 p.45) \n \niii  \nErect and sublime, for one moment of time.  \nIn the next, that wild figure they saw  \n(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,  \nWhile they waited and listened in awe. \n\"It's a Snark!\" was the sound that first came to their ears,  \nAnd seemed almost too good to be true.  \nThen followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:  \nThen the ominous words \"It's a Boo-\"(Carroll, L. 1974 p.94) \n \n \niv `The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used to have the \nbowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished; and it more than once happened, \nwhen the time came for replacing it, that no one on board could remember which end of the \nship it belonged to. They knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman about it \n- he would only refer to his Naval Code, and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty Instructions \nwhich none of them had ever been able to understand - so it generally ended in its being \nfastened on, anyhow, across the rudder. The helmsman used to stand by with tears in his \neyes: he knew it was all wrong, but alas! Rule 42 of the Code, \"No one shall speak to the Man \nat the Helm,\" had been completed by the Bellman himself with the words \"and the Man at the \nHelm shall speak to no one.\" So remonstrance was impossible, and no steering could be \ndone till the next varnishing day. During these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed \nbackwards.\u2019 (Carroll, L. 1974 p. 41). \nv This unfortunately, seems to connote mysticism as something inadequate or negative.  \nvi As to the nature of the Snark, the Bellman said: \n \n`Come, listen my men while I tell you again \nThe five unmistakable marks  \nBy which you may know, wheresoever you go,  \nThe warranted genuine Snarks. \n\"Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,  \nWhich is meagre and hollow, but crisp:  \nLike a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,  \nWith a flavour of Will-o'-the-Wisp.\u2019 (Carroll, L. 1974 p.59) \n \nvii Easterby-Smith and Araujo (1999) differentiate the primarily action-orientated literature of \nthe learning organization from the more analytical literature on organizational learning. I note, \n  24\n                                                                                                                                         \nhowever, that some authors grapple in intellectually rigorous ways with issues of \norganizational learning (e.g. Wijnhoven 2001) without necessarily questioning the underlying \ndesirability of the idea of the learning organization. Reviews of types of literature can be found \nin Prange (1999), Huysman (1999), and \u00d6rtenblad (2002). \n \nviii This is different from the point that the `learning organization' concept is open to ideological \nor instrumental use.  \n \nix See for example http:\/\/www.hhp.ufl.edu\/keepingfit\/ARTICLE\/toomuchwater.htm, accessed \n14.7.2003 \n \nx Dumby, in Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan, act 3; source, The Columbia World of Quotations. \n \nxi Related to me by another manager who witnessed the incident. \n \nxii Admittedly we do not know how the MD perceived the incident.  \n \nxiii `The Cybernetics of Self: a theory of alcoholism' \n \nxiv Positive connotation was a therapeutic technique of the Milan school of family therapy, \nwho were influenced particularly by the work of Gregory Bateson. \n \nxv An established concept in psychodynamic therapy and consulting, `the somewhat puzzling \nand often overlooked processes whereby two or more human systems in relationship to one \nanother seem to `infect\u2019 or become `infected\u2019 by one another.\u2019 (Alderfer 1987 p.210). \n \nxvi That the earlier example can also be framed through Rule 42 is probably apparent, the \nparticipant having effectively questioned whether the MD had fixed the bowsprit to the correct \nend of the ship. \n \nxvii As Stacey et al (2000) argue from the perspective of Complexity Theory. Stacey et al \nargue for sharp differentiation between Complexity Theory and all forms of systems thinking \non teleological grounds. However, there seems to me to be explicit congruence between \nBateson\u2019s systemic epistemology and the formal principles of Complexity Theory in important \nrespects. \n \nxviii Meaning is assumed to be constructed.  \n \nxix Notably, that attributed to Epimenides, a Cretan, who declared `all Cretans are liars'. \n \nxx The term `learning' already has epistemological confusion embedded within it as it  \nrepresent different part so speech. For example it has a noun form, a nominalisation (Bandler \nand Grinder 1975 p.32), implying that learning is an object or has concrete form, such that it \ncould be perceived and measured. This is complicated because learning (as output or \nproduct) has no objective existence, and is often constructed, either with reference to a \npractice context (eg I have created a learning contract so what ever I do in pursuit of it is \n`learning\u2019) or retrospectively (I reflect on my experience and identify changes in meaning and \nunderstanding, which I then label `learning\u2019). The word `learning' is also a participle referring \nto activity or behaviour. However this is further complicated by the fact that there is no simple \nbehaviour called `learning'; it becomes reified, but the term refers it seems to a class of \nbehaviours - see Flemons' quote above - inferred from of specific behaviours, or defined by \nintention. \n \nxxi Bateson commented in 1959 (1973 p.220),  `I have in the past unfortunately called these \nphenomena \u201cdeutero-learning\u201d, and have translated this as \u201clearning to learn\u201d. It would have \nbeen more correct to coin the word trito-learning and to translate it as \u201clearning to learn to \nreceive signals\u201d.\u2019 He did not persist with this alternative term. \n \n  25\n                                                                                                                                         \nxxii The framework proposed by Lave (1996 p.156), consisting of telos, subject-world relations, \nand learning mechanisms may appear similar. Lave's schema is not directly comparable as it \nidentifies requisite dimensions of any theory of learning. In other words it is an analytical tool \nfor interrogating theories. As such it provides a potential framework for evaluating this article's \nperspective - I have not attempted to do so here.  \n \nxxiii It may be that analyses such as Engestr\u00f6m's activity theory perspective (Engestr\u00f6m 2000) \nprovide fruitful, grounded understandings of processes of learning in organizations.  \n \nxxiv It is curious that a recursive, systemic logic is acknowledged within the learning \norganization literature (e.g. Senge\u2019s `laws of the fifth discipline\u2019, 1990 pp. 57 - 67) but is rarely \nused reflexively. In other words, to what extent do authors such as Senge apply systemic \nprinciples such as `twice as much is not necessarily twice as good\u2019 (Watzlawick 1986 p.25) to \ntheir own advocacy for increasing `learning\u2019? \n"}
