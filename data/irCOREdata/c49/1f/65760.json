This article proposes that, although \nscepticism is entirely appropriate, such arguments cannot be allowed to negate the value of \necotourism entirely.  Based on research conducted in three European wetlands of marginal \neconomic status in Greece, Lithuania and Romania, this article proposes a typology of \nmodels \u2013 of ecotourism, sustainable tourism, and responsible tourism \u2013 that helps to \ndifferentiate \u201epractice\u201f from \u201egood practice\u201f.  The research highlights the importance of local \npeople\u201fs discourse on ecotourism, which in this case was seen not only as an economic \nactivity but as an aspirational moral virtue concerned with tidiness and maintaing the beauty \nof nature.  Anthropology for ecotourism, which takes local people\u201fs views and opinions into \naccount in the search for appropriate forms of tourism development that can transform \npeople\u201fs lives and environments for the better, is as important as the anthropology of \necotourism. \n   \nKey words:  Ecotourism, wetland environments, responsible tourism, sustainable tourism, \nEurope, Lithuania, Greece, Romania \n \nShortened version of title for running head:  Ecotourism in European Wetlands\n  \n3 \nAnthropology and Ecotourism in European Wetlands: Bubbles, Babies and \nBathwater \n \n \n \nIntroduction  \nIn accepting many of the criticisms of ecotourism \u2013 that it is too often a \u201ebubble\u201f (carrier and \nMacleod 2005), that it has become an umbrella term for too many practices that are \nessentially \u201eirresponsible\u201f in their nature (Russell and Wallace 2004) - we are in danger of \n\u201ethrowing the baby out with the bathwater\u201f if we go on to assume that nothing done in the \nname of ecotourism is of value to conservation or society.  This article seeks to counteract \nsome of the blanket criticisms of ecotourism that have been made in social anthropology by \npresenting a typology of models \u2013 of ecotourism, sustainable tourism and responsible tourism \n- that helps to differentiate what is practice from what is good practice.  Based on field \nresearch conducted in three protected wetland sites around Europe, it argues that, while \nscepticism about the use of the term \u201eecotourism\u201f is in order, such an attitude should not be \nallowed to obscure the real and potential value of some forms of ecotourism, specifically \nresponsible tourism.  Each of the three sites studied - Lake Kerkini in Greece, the Nemunas \nDelta in Lithuania, and the Danube Delta, Romania \u2013 are important areas of biodiversity that \nalso support significant human populations.  This article examines how ecotourism and the \npotential for ecotourism was perceived by the local inhabitants in each of the wetland sites \ncovered, and highlights the importance of including all three \u201ecorners\u201f of the responsible \ntourism enterprise \u2013 hosts, guests, and environment \u2013 in any development of tourism that also \nseeks to promote conservation.     \n The research on which this article is based took place under the auspices of a larger \nproject, the Integrated Management of European Wetlands (IMEW), funded by the European \nCommission.\n1\n  The research presented here took place as part of Work Package 5 (WP5), \nwhich was charged with considering the current situation and potential pathways to the \n  \n4 \ndevelopment of responsible tourism in the wetland areas involved.  The rationale for the \nstudy was that the development of this form of tourism is important for the continued \nprotection of the wetlands and the support of local economies.  WP5 looked at the \nrelationships and perceptions of \u201chosts and guests\u201d (Smith 1989), and sought to answer the \nquestion of whether appropriate forms of tourism development can help promote \nenvironmental conservation.  The answer presented here, not unequivocally, is \u201eyes\u201f.   \n    \n   \nAnthropology of ecotourism : anthropology for ecotourism \n  \nEcotourism as a term has its origins in the 1980s and 1990s as an alternative to the negative \nsocial, economic and environmental effects of \u201emass tourism\u201f (Graburn 1995: 162).  As a foil \nto the latter, there was a tendency for ecotourism to come to stand for everything that mass \ntourism was not, and thus as a concept it has grown rapidly and developed multiple \nmeanings.  The Ecotourism Society (1991) has one of the most holistic definitions of \necotourism, in its definition of it as \u201eresponsible travel to natural areas that conserves the \nenvironment and improves the well-being of local people\u201f.  Yet too often ecotourism is used \nas a catch-all phrase that is applied to almost anything that links tourism and Nature: tours \nthat involve looking at trees of animals; holidays with a hunting or fishing element; staying in \nhotels that are based on ecologically conservative principles; visits to rural areas or farms; \neating \u201enatural\u201f products \u2013 all these can be (and often are) found sheltering under the \nincreasingly large and fashionable umbrella of \u201eecotourism\u201f.  In other words, the practice of \necotourism may well bear no relation to the laudable environmental and social goals set out \nfor it by organizations such as the Ecotourism Society.  It has become, as Gray (2003:113) \nputs it, \u201can ambiguous term that allows actors to speak the same language while pursuing \ndifferent objectives.\u201d   \n  \n5 \n Ecotourism has been similarly criticized (by Carrier and Macleod 2005: 316) for \nbeing a term \u201cso elastic that it may be close to meaningless\u201d.  They also conceptualize an \n\u201eecotourism bubble\u201f, in which the often harmful contexts of ecotourism practice can be \nignored.  For example, the hidden environmental costs of much ecotourism (such as the CO2 \nemissions from the big jets used to carry international tourists to their ecotouristic \ndestinations) are rightly questioned by Carrier and Macleod, among others.  But not all \necotourists are of the intercontinental elite variety.  Furthermore, irrespective of the socio-\ncultural and environmental contexts within which ecotourists visit a place, once they are there \ncertain forms of tourism practice will be more valuable for tourists, local people and the \nenvironment than others.  It is irresponsible for Carrier and Macleod to \u201eburst the bubble\u201f of \necotourism if this is to deny the validity of any kind of ecotourism altogether.  Critical \nexamination of the meaning and philosophical underpinnings of concepts such as ecotourism \nis a useful corrective to unreflective research and practice, but following on from their \ncritiques  researchers need to get off the fence and take a stance on what types of tourism are \nbetter or worse than others, and why.   \n Fortunately we do not need to delve very far into the fields of economics and ethics to \nunderstand what these types might be.  One major problem with most large-scale tourism is \n\u201eleakage\u201f, where money spent by international tourists on holiday in the developing world \nends up in developed countries, or by national (and international) tourists benefiting major \nentrepreneurs and companies who are external to a region and siphon all profit from the \nenterprise out of the region.  The amount of leakage varies by country \u2013 the World Bank \nestimates it is around 40% for India, 60% in Thailand, 70% for Kenyan beach holidays and \nup to 80% in the Caribbean (Mann 2000). As Tom Selwyn (2001), writing recently about the \ndevelopment of tourism and the anthropology of tourism in Bosnia-Hercegovina, puts it: \n \n  \n6 \nThere is widespread feeling\u2026that international programmes having anything to do \nwith economic development need underpinning by principles of 'fair trade' rather than \nby uncritical notions of 'free trade'\u2026There is little point in BiH becoming a preserve \nfor large European tour operators.  There is more support for the view that the \nindustry [tourism] should make a contribution to employment generation at very local \nlevels (Selwyn 2001). \n \nThe crucial issue in tourism ethics, as Prosser argues, is \u201cto maintain control and autonomy in \nhandling the scale and character of tourism and evaluating the role it is to play in \ndevelopment policies\u201d (1990:50; cf. Eadington and Smith 1992:3).   \n We might also wish to consider socio-economic inequities in travel and modes of \ntravel at the international level.  Foreign travel is still very much an elite activity.  In 1996, \nonly 3.5% of the world\u201fs total population travelled abroad, 80% of them from 17 European \nnations, the USA, Canada or Japan.  There are many types within the category of \u201eelite \ntraveller\u201f.  Evidence suggests that a policy of promoting only the upper, luxury travel end of \nthe market, unless it is very carefully managed, is more likely to lead to leakage than a policy \nof providing cheaper accommodation that is better controlled by local people.  \u201eBackpacker\u201f \ntourists, while much maligned for the limited amounts of money they are likely to spend, are \nmore likely to use and respond positively to the sorts of facilities that local people are able to \nprovide.  On the other hand, international tourists of all sorts are more liable to be influenced \nby the changing fashions and geo-political tensions, prompting Bhattarai et al (2005) to \nsuggest that a country such as Nepal would do better to develop regional pilgrimage tourism, \nfocussed on Asian markets, than to be dependent on adventure tourism for westerners.   \n The EU notes the relative absence of information about \u201ein-country\u201f or \u201elocal\u201f tourists \nand \u201eday trippers\u201f in tourism research (EC 2000), since they tend not to show up in \n  \n7 \naccommodation statistics, yet the \u201ecarbon footprint\u201f of such people is likely to be far less \ndamaging than that of the international ecotourists Carrier and Macleod so despise.  What is \nneeded, in commercial terms, is probably a segmented market, the slings and arrows of \noutrageous fortune with regard to tourist economy ameliorated somewhat through \ndiversification of the nationalities and types of tourist entertained in any destination.  Given \nthe temperamental nature of tourism it is also preferable if local people engage in it as one of \na range of multiple livelihoods, or at least if they have the option to revert to a different \nlivelihood should the tourist trade fluctuate.  Seasonality in the market is another \ndiversification issue tourism planners seek to address. \n Thus rather than \u201ethrowing it out\u201f altogether, we need to refine our use of the term \necotourism, using the materials available to us to chart existing forms of tourism and existing \nattitudes towards it, to assess present and future implications of tourism for local livelihoods, \nand to examine people\u201fs perceptions and understandings of concepts such as \u201eecotourism\u201f, \n\u201esustainable tourism\u201f and \u201eresponsible tourism\u201f and the implications of these for future \ntourism development in any place.  In order to do this, the WP5 project devised a heuristic \ntypology of practices that help to redefine our understanding of the meaning and value of \necotourism.  If \u201eecotourism\u201f is almost any form of tourism linking tourism and nature, \n\u201esustainable tourism\u201f is concerned with the long term effects of that relationship not only on \nthe environment but also on local people.  \u201eResponsible tourism\u201f is concerned with the nature \nof that relationship, and brings the actions of tourists themselves into the frame.  The \nfollowing diagrams should help to make this clearer: \n \n  \n8 \n \n \nFigure 1: Ecotourism model.  Ecotourism in the classic sense engages tourists who seek out \nactivities connected in some way to the environment.  The practices of tourists vary between \nsensitive to destructive in regards to environmental impact.  Sensitive behaviour conforms to \nthe ideal \u201cclassic\u201d definition.  However, negative environmental practices under the guise of \n\u201cecotourism\u201d is a documented reality which has led to this term being contested.  Note that \necotourism does not emphasise local livelihoods and traditions as much as other forms of \ntourism. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Sustainable tourism model.  Sustainable tourism emphasises the long-term, \nenvironmentally conservative practices of local people when they host guests.  Tourists may \nbe aware of these practices, but it is not the reason for their visit.  Local livelihoods benefit \ndirectly from sustainable tourism, which may also promote traditional cultural practices as \nwell as low-impact environmental activities. \n \n \n \nResponsible\n     Tourism\nTourists\nEnvironment\nLocal People  \n \nFigure 3: Responsible tourism model.  Responsible tourism occurs when both tourists and \nlocal people engage in a sensitive manner towards the environment.  Leakage of tourist \n  \n9 \nrevenue outside the local communities is minimal.  Cultural practices and traditions are \nrespected along with the local environment.  It should be noted that this is best accords with \nthe definition of ecotourism as \u201cresponsible travel to natural areas that conserves the \nenvironment and improves the well-being of local people\u201f proposed by the Ecotourism \nSociety (www.ecotourism.org). \n \n In order to address the elasticiy and consequent disutility or the term \u201eecotourism\u201f, our \nterminology in the project with regard to \u201egood practice\u201f shifted towards \u201esustainable \ntourism\u201f and \u201eresponsible tourism\u201f.  Our model was one which would minimize leakage so \nthat benefits to local people could be maximized, would cater for the needs of national as \nwell as international tourists, and would sustain the biosphere through making it worth \npeople\u201fs while to maintain and cherish the biodiversity of the places both lived in and visited.  \nIt took into account the attitudes and education of hosts as well as guests.  It also required the \ndisaggregation of terms such as \u201ehosts\u201f and \u201eguests\u201f, \u201elocals\u201f and \u201etourists\u201f, so that we could \nunderstand more of the variety and complexity in what was happening and what might need \nto be done in the future.  Our hypothesis (if we needed one) was that the development of \nsmall-scale \u201ehomestay\u201f type tourism in facilities provided and managed by local people, \noffered the maximum likelihood of economic and environmental success and was truly \n\u201eresponsible\u201f ecotourism.  However, the particular circumstances of each location (e.g. \ninfrastructural issues) needed to be taken into account in the application of this \u201eglobal\u201f \nmodel, as did the opinions and aspirations of local people.  As Hall and Kinnaird (1994: 133) \nput it, \u201cFor tourism development to be successful and acceptable, sensitivity of \nimplementation and sustainability and local participation must be more than just clich\u00e9s in \nnational or corporate plans.  Most importantly, local populations must be involved and shown \nthat conservation and tourism can complement each other to the economic advantage of the \nlocal community\u201d. \n We were not sure that the local populations in each of the wetland areas needed to be \n\u201eshown\u201f the advantages of ecotourism in the way Hall and Kinnaird suggest.  What we \n  \n10 \nwanted to do was find out how the discourses of ecotourism played out in their everyday \nlives.  Stronza (2001) notes how most studies of local people look on them as the passive \nrecipients of the impacts of tourism rather than creative entrepreneurs and active agents in its \ndevelopment (cf. Chambers 1999: x). Of course, we must be mindful of the dangers of \nassuming that local people are part of a cohesive community who will all benefit equally and \nshare the proceeds of ecotourism development.  As Stronza reminds us, \u201cnot all people in a \nhost destination participate in tourism equally\u201d (ibid: 266-7).  On the other hand, to use such \nan argument as an excuse for inactivity in regions that are socio-economically marginal and \nenvironmentally vulnerable is inexcusable.  We need to move beyond West and Carrier \n(2004: 484)\u201fs intrigue with \u201cecotourism as the institutional expression of particular sets of \nlate capitalist values in a particular political-economic climate,\u201d for example, (the \nanthropology of ecotourism), towards consideration of an anthropology for ecotourism.\n2\n  If a \ncommunity is to \u201cplay a significant role in determining the kind of tourists it receives and the \nform of tourism they practice\u201d (Nash 1981: 462), then the perceptions and aspirations voiced \nby local people on this subject must be paramount. \n  \nMethods \n Work Package 5 of the IMEW project was the first time a comparative and holistic \napproach had been taken to the study of ecotourism in the wetland sites considered, using the \ntestimonies of tourists, stakeholders and local people to formulate a holistic picture of tourism \nand ecotourism current and potential in each place.  At each site, an ethnographic case study \nwas developed over a three-year period from 2001 to 2004.  Archival and textual research in \neach area was complemented by the development of an ethnographic record of local \ntraditions relevant to the development of tourism: gastronomy, architecture, cultural and \nreligious celebrations, etc.  We also engaged in the mapping of companies, organizations and \n  \n11 \nindividuals involved in tourism in the area.  There were 6-10 focus groups and 25-40 semi-\nstructured interviews with stakeholders in each wetland site, and up to 80 structured \ninterviews with tourists.  The bulk of the ethnographic research was carried out by research \npartners from the respective region.  They were able to conduct the research in the \nappropriate national languages; the results were transcribed and translated into English for \nfurther analysis. \n There were practical problems in conducting a study across three such diverse areas.  \nFor example, in Romania economic constraints meant that some of the structured interviews \nwere carried out by upper years high school children.  Many of the researchers were not \nsocial scientists by training, and hence important orientation and methods work was \nformulated at workshops hosted in Durham in 2001 and 2004, as well as during field visits by \nmembers of staff from Durham.  Site visits were also important sources of ethnographic \nmaterial from participant-observation and provided opportunities for further discussion with \npartners.  Results from all the dimensions of WP5 were cross-referenced with those from the \nother four work packages for overall themes and cross-cultural comparisons (IMEW 2004). \n  \nEcotourism: contexts and discourses in the three wetland sites \n The three wetland areas studied were similar in the economic problems they faced \nrelative to the region or country they were in, with many young people leaving the wetlands \nin search of employment elsewhere.  All the wetlands are the subject of conservation \nmeasures:  Kerkini Lake in Greece is designated as of international importance within the \nRamsar Convention, and has been designated a Special Protected Area through an EU \ndirective.  The Nemunas Delta in Lithuania (also a Ramsar site) comes under the control of \nthe Nemunas Delta Regional Park, which was established in 1992.  The Danube Delta \nBiosphere Research Authority was established in Romania in 1990.  In Lithuania and \n  \n12 \nRomania, the authorities have taken steps to severely limit local people\u201fs access to parts of \nthe wetland.   \n While the institutions affecting them are different in each site, all three have a \ncommon history of local inhabitants\u201f views not being taken into account in environmental \nplanning and legislation (IMEW 2004).  In each of the case studies that follow, I shall outline \nthe geographical and touristic parameters which frame local people\u201fs ideas and perceptions of \necotourism, after which I go on to analyse the similarities and differences in the discourses \nsurrounding the term.  \n   \nGreece \nThe wetland environment of Lake Kerkini in northern Greece is the result of an artificial lake \nformed by damming the Stymon river for irrigation and flood control purposes in 1932.  In \n1982 a bigger dam was constructed next to the old one in order to increase the irrigation \ncapacity.  The natural environment, with its unusual concatenation of wetland and the \nadjacent Belles mountains, is the main tourist attraction.  In addition to offering the richest \nand largest bird colony in Greece, the semi-wild water buffaloes wandering along the lake \nshores (said to date from Alexander the Great\u201fs time) are an additional iconic feature.  \nCulturally the region is a rich mixture of local traditions, resulting from the mixture of \n\u201eVlachoi\u201f (Greeks who have lived in the area for some time) and those who settled from Asia \nMinor during the last century.  In some villages, people are beginning to organise festivals \nbased on their traditions, partly to boost visitor numbers.  Tourism in the Belles Mountains \npredates construction of the dam.  The health-giving properties of the cooler temperatures and \nlower humidity were promoted, particularly for people suffering from lung disease.  Tavernas \nin the mountains continue to be well frequented by day trippers who combine gastronomy \nwith a visit to Lake Kerkini or the monastery nearby. \n  \n13 \n It is estimated that at least 30,000 people per year visit the Lake Kerkini area, \nalthough the vast majority come from other parts of northern Greece (principally \nThessaloniki, the nearest major city, about two hours\u201f drive to the south) on weekend day \ntrips, and are not easily counted.  Only a small, but increasing, proportion of visitors come \nfrom other parts of Greece, and very few visitors are from other countries. \n The terms \u201eresponsible\u201f or \u201esustainable\u201f tourism are not commonly used in Greek \nparlance.  Indeed, \u201eresponsible\u201f in Greek is better translated as \u201emanaged\u201f, and lacks the \nmoral overtones of the word \u201eresponsible\u201f in English.  The favoured words in Greek are eco- \nor agrotourism, which are often used interchangeably.  \u201eOikos\u201f in Greek means \n\u201efamily\/house\u201f as well as \u201eecology\u201f.  This double meaning helps contribute to the way that \npeople in the Kerkini area tend to equate ecotourism with a broad experience encompassing \nlife in a homestay environment along with nature (but normally a tamed, domesticated \nnature).  As one taverna owner said, \n \n\u201cIn my opinion, ecotourism means that visitors to the region should be able to have \nthe opportunity for direct access to knowledge and contact with the activities of the \nlocal population.  For example, to be able to visit a farm, see how apples grow on the \ntrees or be given the chance to get a basket and pick some themselves, to see how an \nanimal is raised or how an agricultural product is manufactured and packaged.  That is \nthe meaning of ecotourism for me.  Waking up in the morning and going to the nest to \npick one\u201fs eggs for breakfast.\u201d  \n \nThe association of ecotourism with living on a farm occurred across all educational levels.  \nAn organic farmer described agrotourism succinctly as being when \u201ca professional farmer \nwhose basic income comes from farming is able to complement his income from the visiting \n  \n14 \ntourists either by having two or three rooms that he lets or by producing some goods which \nhe may process to a certain degree and sell\u2026\u201d   \n Although some local people\u201fs definitions of ecotourism lean decidedly towards the \ndomestic associations of oikos, others move towards more ecological connotations.  For one \nfarmer, \u201cessentially the question is what we must present to the tourist - the way of life we \nhave, the environment and the products we produce ourselves.  In other words the way of life \nwe have in our daily routine. To present, what for me is agrotourism and at the same time to \ncome to know our ecosystem, the lake, our problems, our hunting, our whole life.\u201d  \nAccording to one taverna owner, guests coming to the area who are \u201caware\u201d and know \n\u201csomething about the mechanisms of nature, how things function in the natural environment\u201d \nare ecotourists.  For one hotel owner with an advanced academic degree, ecotourism means \n\u201c\u2026to bring tourism through some proper studies but not to destroy the environment.  \nTourism comes but without damaging the area.\u201d \n Another important idea about ecotourism in local people\u201fs minds was its opposition \nto, and possible conflict with, \u201cconventional tourism\u201d, that is, the forms of uncontrolled \ndevelopment and mass tourism seen in the Greek islands and elsewhere.  These offered \npotent examples of the kinds of tourism people wanted to avoid having in their area.  One \nfarmer said that she would like tourist development to happen, but that it should not comprise \n\u201csome kind of casino overlooking the lake\u201d.  She further commented, \u201cthe hotels and the \nexisting tourism or the future tourism must be ecologically minded.  In order not to see some, \nsay, Hilton-type hotels in the area, or casinos or something like that, or foreign women  \ndancing on the hotel\u201fs bar half naked.\u201d.  In contrast, ecotourism was seen as something which \nis limited and regulated, marked by \u201cnon-standardised constructions\u201d rather than monotonous \nrows of large hotels. \n Local people perceive two types of tourist as coming to Lake Kerkini.  In the words of \n  \n15 \na mature local resident who is studying agriculture and agrotourism,  \n \n\u201c\u2026simply there are some tourists that are very interested in nature, in the \nenvironment around here, they want to learn about the history of the area, they want \nto hike on the mountain, they ask a lot of things\u2026and there are some other tourists \nthat just come [laughter].  They\u201fve heard that there is something here, a lake and so \nthey come.\u201d \n \nMany people have noticed an increase in the latter type of visitor, who are perceived as less \nthoughtful and less appreciative of the natural world than the former.  In the words of a horse \nconcession owner,   \n \n\u201c\u2026the visitors nowadays are not...like the visitors that used to come here \u2026Before \nthe tourists were nature lovers, people who loved the nature\u2026Nowadays\u2026the area is \nvery much advertised, now everyone comes, every random one.\u201d   \n \nThe standard of facilities expected by the latter sort of tourist are seen as much higher.  In the \nwords of this same man, visitors come with a desire \u201cto get away from the town and go to the \ncountryside believing that in this way they will go and live like the ones living in the \ncountryside, but this is only in their minds [laughter].  Because, when they come here actually \nthey want some comforts and conveniences\u201d.  \n Local people saw a need to \u201eclean up their act\u201f if further tourism was to be \nencouraged.  They generally saw themselves as their own worst enemies when it came to \nrubbish.  According to one informant: \n \n  \n16 \n\u201cif you ask your parents they will tell you that for Greeks cleanliness was never a \npriority.  We didn\u201ft know about cleanliness.  There were no fences or toilet facilities.  \nWe didn\u201ft care much about these things.  At some point things changed.  There are \nsome people though who still wish to live with those standards.  Someone should tell \nthem that they should clean up everything.\u201d \n \nThe aspirational relationship between \u201ehosts\u201f and \u201eguests\u201f is summarized in the word \n\u201efiloxenia\u201f, which loosely and somewhat superficially translates into English as \u201ehospitality\u201f.  \nSome people\u201fs conceptions of how filoxenia should work are based on experiences they had \nas tourists themselves.  As one woman, involved with an agro-tourism co-operative, said, \n\u201c\u2026in this area we are more interested in family style accommodation like in Austria where I \nhappened to go at least four times, small hostels, traditional and some other kind of filoxenia.  \nYou do not call the person a visitor but filoxenoumenos [\u201cone who is offered hospitality\u201d].  In \norder for filoxenia to develop, overnight accommodation is necessary.  \u201cI would like more \npeople to stay at the village which means that they could see the area better, have a better \nidea and while having him\/her for more than two days we could host them and tell them a \nfew things.  When they come in and out of the shop there is very little time to serve them and \nfor them to have a more integrated view.\u201d  Television programmes have featured the area in \nthe past few years.  One local fisherman reported that local views about the lake were \nambivalent until after the television programmes, when \u201cpeople in the village started \ntalking\u2026started to feel proud.\u201d \n \nIn the discourse of ecotourism in Lake Kerkini, then, we start to see themes emerging that \nwill be repeated with different nuances in the two other wetland areas studied.  Firstly there \nare the elastic definitions which in this case link ecotourism with agrotourism but also, \n  \n17 \nthough the specific Greek term \u201eoikos\u201f, link ecotourism firmly in people\u201fs minds with \nhomestay tourism.  Then there is the contrast between \u201eecotourism\u201f and \u201econventional\u201f, mass \ntourism, the effects of which are evident for all to see along many parts of the Greek coastline \nand islands.  In setting up an opposition in this way, ecotourism assumes a degree of moral \nvirtue in people\u201fs eyes, a domesticity and homeliness compared to the debauchery of a \n(foreign) woman dancing on a hotel bar half-naked.  However, it is a virtue that local people \ndo not feel themselves entirely worthy of, insofar as they attribute the untidiness and ugliness \npresent in this \u201enatural\u201f place to the need for some people to modernise their hygiene and \nwaste disposal habits.  This is a theme that is repeated in the Lithuanian and Romanian cases \nthat follow.     \n \nLithuania \nThe Nemunas Delta in Lithuania forms a western border of the country with the former \nSoviet republic of Kaliningrad.  It is estimated that the Nemunas Delta area hosts 200,000 \u2013 \n300,000 visitors per annum.  Summer is the high season for tourism, but anglers come all \nyear round.  In our study, 84% of tourists interviewed were from Lithuania.  Of these, \nroughly half were from places less than 100km away.  The majority (two thirds) of foreign \ntourists were German, the rest were from Finland, Poland and Russia.  60% were on a day \ntrip to the area; of the rest, more than half were self-catering (i.e. staying in their own cars, \ntents or private rental accommodation) and 37% were staying in homestay accommodation. \n Fishing is the dominant form of tourism, making up an estimated 70% of the total.  \nThe majority of anglers visiting the area are Lithuanian and are generally independent visitors \nor overnight tourists who come equipped with food and\/or camping gear.  They tend not to \nstay in existing homestay accommodation, which they regard as too expensive.  Nostalgia \ntourism accounts for roughly 5 \u2013 10% of the area\u201fs tourism.  It comprises mostly former \n  \n18 \nresidents now living in Germany.  These types of tourists are informally referred to as \n\u201cMemell\u00e4nder\u201d, that is, people from the Memel (Nemunas).  The flow of these types of \ntourists was heaviest directly after the Second World War and is now waning because people \nare ageing or were content with a single visit.  However, some of the children and \ngrandchildren of these former inhabitants continue to visit the area, spending money on goods \nand services, and tending to their graveyards.  Nature tourism comprises only 5 \u2013 7.5% of the \ntourism in the Nemunas Delta.   \n As in Greece, connotations of eco-tourism in Lithuania were positive and often \ncorrelated with \u201cclean and tidy\u201d environments.  A 60 year-old milkmaid responded to the \nquestion \u201cwhat about ecotourism?\u201d with \u201cyou mean clean, don\u201ft you?\u201d  Another local person \ndefined ecotourism as \u201cenvironmentally clean tourism\u201d.  Indeed, rubbish and pollution were \npervasive themes dominating many exchanges about the natural environment.  The following \ndialogue with a 16 year-old student illustrates a typical response: \n \nQ: Have you ever heard a word \u201ceco-tourism\u201d? \nA: No I haven\u201ft. \nQ: How could you explain it? \nA: It\u201fs about ecology. Tourism when you behave well in nature. \nQ: Could eco-tourism be developed here? \nA: Yes, of course. \nQ: How should local people and tourists protect the environment and biodiversity? \nA: They should pollute the environment less. Tourists should look after the campsites. \nThey shouldn\u201ft drop litter. Local people should look after their homes. They should \nkeep everything in order. \n \n  \n19 \nThe correlation of ecotourism with a clean and tidy moral universe is, like Greece, a largely \naspirational one and is perhaps compounded by its comparative rarity as a tourist form (as \nrevealed by the \u201enature tourism\u201f statistic).  The status of fishing tourism was problematic.  \nSome local people felt that fishing was a natural activity\n3\n and that tourists had little or no \nimpact on the environment.  A much more prevalent view, however, was that fishing tourists \nwere responsible for leaving a lot of rubbish.  Rubbish bags were reportedly issued alongside \nfishing licences, but were not used.  People complained of a lack of refuse and sanitation \ndisposal.   \n As in Greece, some local people also felt they themselves were to blame for the \nrubbish, and one person correlated untidy locals with those who were unemployed.  Others \nmentioned that keeping local communities tidy was something which had to be done \nconsistently through time, and that solutions to the problem had to be long-term.  Very \nimportantly, there was a strong feeling that more people would visit the area if improvements \nwere made in keeping areas orderly and free of rubbish.   \n Some people mentioned with pride that people came to the area to enjoy nature, peace \nand quiet, and contrasted what they were able to offer with the mass tourism found in the \ncoastal resort of Palanga, situated further north.  The consensus view seemed to be that \ntourism should not be of this mass type.  One resident described how some visitors would \ndrive through the local forest and feel disturbed, even \u201cfrightened\u201d by midges.  However, \n\u201c\u2026other people driving through the forest are happy.  I think they are our true tourists and \nthat this place is for them.\u201d   \n A current criticism of tourism in one of the villages involved in the study was that \n\u201ctourists don\u201ft stay for a long time.  They arrive in buses, go along the central street and \nleave.\u201d  Inhabitants in this village often expressed the opinion that there was nothing to show \ntourists, who tended to \u201carrive and leave with nothing\u201d.  One young cleaning woman was \n  \n20 \nsimilarly disparaging: \u201cwe don\u201ft have anything special here \u2013 only water.\u201d  But a young \nunemployed man appreciated that people came \u201cto our remote area\u201d to have a rest from the \nnoise and bustle of the towns. One local teacher said \u201cI live here and I don\u201ft find anything \nspecial, but people who come here value our nature, our surroundings.\u201d  Similar sentiments \nwere expressed by a village woman: \u201cif strangers say it is nice, it means it is really nice.  We \nare used to it and don\u201ft see its beauty\u201d. \n Local people were generally enthusiastic about the potential development of \necotourism in the area, largely for its perceived economic benefits.  The term \u201centrepreneur\u201d \nwas not used to describe local people providing forms of hospitality to tourists, perhaps due \nto ambivalence towards capitalism dating back to the Soviet period.  Despite this, however, \nmany local people were already working hard to use private means to engage with tourism.  \nOddly, it was a local person not engaged with tourism who summarised this independent \nspirit.  The milkmaid talked about the economic hardship of young women in the community \nand said that this problem \u201cdoesn\u201ft mean that we are going to sit like ministers and do \nnothing.\u201d  Local perspectives on tourism varied between the different villages, but a common \ntheme in interviews with local people was that more work was needed in order to develop the \ninfrastructural support necessary for it to flourish.  There was also a perceived need to lift the \nconstraints which restrictions were inflicting on potential entrepreneurs, \u201cEither we are \nallowed or we are not allowed [to establish tourism enterprises], but we have to control the \nsituation.  We have the regional park here but being in wild nature is difficult because of the \nstrict rules.\u201d  \n Another specific problem was the proximity of the region to the Russian satellite of \nKaliningrad.  Kaliningrad was seen not only as a source of poaching and pollution but also as \na constraint to tourism development.  Restrictive border controls required seemingly \nexcessive documentation for even small day trips between the waterways of the two \n  \n21 \ncountries.  One entrepreneur complained that tourists who rented a canoe of his were escorted \nback to his property by armed border guards because their canoe lacked some of the proper \ndocumentation.  In addition to tourist passports, all boats, even a canoe, must carry \ncertification of technical examination, a registration number and a purchasing document.  The \nentrepreneur, frustrated, complained that \u201cthe frontier hampers [tourism development], \nprotection of nature hampers [tourism development].  They do not allow anybody to come \nhere.  Frontier guards have no work.  Nobody builds a fire there, everybody is scared to come \nthere because they catch you at once.  We have perfect rules to punish everybody.\u201d  Despite \nthese difficulties, the point was also made that proximity to Kaliningrad could be an \nopportunity if more open access were permitted.  One inhabitant mentioned that recent plans \n(shelved) to build a bridge between the area and Kaliningrad would have helped to increase \ntourism. \n \nIn the Nemunas Delta, therefore, like Lake Kerkini, people were not sitting waiting for \necotourism to happen \u2013 they were active agents in its development, Stronza-style (2001).  it \nmaintains its contrastive position with mass tourism, with the resort of Palanga the exemplar \nhere.  Again the moral virtue of ecotourism developing where rubbish and dirt could be kept \nin check and nature allowed to flourish was mentioned, although it must be pointed out that, \nprobably due to its relatively late nascence on the scene and relatively small numbers of those \nfollowing what is known as \u201enature tourism\u201f compared to fishing and cultural pursuits, local \npeople\u201fs knowledge of and imagination concerning ecotourism was generally lower than in \nthe other two sites. \n \nRomania \nThe Danube delta is the largest wetland site in Europe, and is a route for numerous migrating \n  \n22 \nbirds and other flora and fauna.  It therefore has much to offer the birdwatcher, fisherman, \nnaturalist and hunter.  The size of the area covered by the Danube delta means that more \nvisitors than in Greece or Lithuania stay for at least one night.  However, in recent years \nsome of the hotels and agencies in Tulcea, the \u201ejumping off\u201f town for the delta, have \norganised day trips to Sulina and the village of Sfintu Gheorgie at the end of the Danube delta \nbranches of the same names.  At present the main tourist season is during the summer \nmonths, particularly July and August.  Hunting is a minor activity but one that brings in \nvisitors to the area out of the summer tourist season.  The Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve \nAuthority (DDBRA) is much involved in regulating tourism.  It has a tourist information \ncentre at Tulcea and runs two other visitor centres in the delta itself. \n Tourism is unequally distributed around the delta.  Some placed are aesthetically \nblighted.  Caraorman, for example, located off the Sulina branch, is dominated by an \nabandoned sand and gravel extraction works, a failed legacy of the Ceaucescu era, and a \ntourist visiting Chilia Veche, accessible only by a long ferry ride from Tulcea, is greeted by a \nvista of modern buildings, including blocks of flats and the skeleton of a hotel that was under \nconstruction before the revolution and never completed.  Its prison is also something of an \neyesore, but does at least generate some visitors since, because transport is not daily, people \nvisiting inmates have to stay in the village overnight. \n Tourism numbers have declined from a peak of 139,000 in 1980, and the revolution of \n1989 transformed the types of tourist visiting or able to visit. One homestay provider in \nCrisan, one of the main tourist village destinations in the delta, remembered that \u201cthere were \nso many [tourists] before the revolution that they were staying on the street desperately \nlooking for accommodation.\u201d  However, numbers appear to be increasing again, although \ngiven the vastness of the area, exact estimates are hard to make. The ratio of Romanian to \nforeign visitors is roughly 2:1, a lower ratio than for Greece or Lithuania. \n  \n23 \n A homestay provider in Sf. Gheorgie described ecotourism as follows: \u201cI don\u201ft know \nif I understand well.  Not with a tent but like living with me?  I put rubbish in the container \nand take it to a central spot.  I insulate the house\u201fs walls with reed so it doesn\u201ft need much \nenergy to heat.  This is an eco-friendly heating system.  I have a good boat that does not put \noil in the water\u2026I have taken the rubbish off my fishing guests and put it in my boat so my \nboat is messy but not the outside.\u201d  Again, the moral virtue inherent in ecotourism and its \naspirational treatment of rubbish in order to protect the beauty of nature comes over loud and \nclear in this statement, but also its equation with \u201enot camping\u201f, the disorder associated with \nwhich has parallels in Lithuania. \n A more salient local categorisation of tourism in the Danube delta, however, is into \n\u201eorganised\u201f or \u201eunorganised\u201f.  \u201eOrganised\u201f was used to describe the day or multi-day trips \norganised by the hotels in Tulcea and the floating hotels in villages on the edge of the delta that \nare accessible by car.  However, these types of accommodation were generally too expensive \nfor most Romanian budgets although they were frequently used by foreign visitors.  \n\u201eUnorganised\u201f tourism described \u201cindividual\u201d tourism where people come to the delta to camp, \nswim and\/or fish.  This form of tourism was criticised on a number of grounds, the most cited \nof which was the rubbish generated.  Other complaints included how little money those with \ntheir own accommodation injected into the economy, and noise pollution.  One tourist operator \nin Murighol, another delta village, suggested, \u201cthey [tourists camping on the riverbanks] are not \npaying any tax and maybe they should\u2026to the local authorities\u201d.  Some deaths from swimming \nin the delta were also reported each year as individuals partaking in \u201eunorganised\u201f tourism \ndrowned after being sucked into whirlpools created by underwater tree trunks. \n Another type of unorganised tourism is where individuals or families travel by boat to \nvillages within the delta and stay with local families.  This was referred to as \u201ctraditional\u201d \ntourism or \u201chomestay\u201d tourism.  Homestay tourism has a long history in Romania, and \n  \n24 \nvillages that are relatively accessible by ferry are favoured.  The popularity of Crisan, for \nexample, is in part due to its relatively accessible location on the Sulina branch of the \nDanube, the main shipping channel, where it is served three times a week by ferry.     \n However, a problem facing the further, more organised development of homestay \ntourism is the difficulty of making reservations ahead of time.  Instead, tourists are greeted at \nthe pier by a number of homestay providers, each of whom is vying to get tourists to stay at \ntheir homes.  Once the host and guest link up, stays generally include the consumption of \nlocal dishes, most of which include some fish and the well known local delicacy, fish soup.  \nSome homestay providers offer tours of the areas by rowboat or small motor boat.  Others let \nthe tourists find their own ways to relax.  The research arm of the DDBRA has encouraged \nthe establishment of a network of homestay tourism providers, but co-operation and \ncommunication remains a problem. \n As in the other wetland sites, local people were acutely aware of the types of tourism \nthey wanted to encourage and those they did not.  As well as criticizing campers, they \nresented the lack of benefit from the day trips organised from Tulcea: for example, in one \nvillage on the coast, day tourists were driven in a horsecart from the pier to the beach, \nbypassing local shops and services completely.  When homestay providers provide their own \nmenus for their day excursions, by contrast, the profit was seen to stay more or less \ncompletely in local hands.   \n The attribution of blame for ecologically damaging behaviour (as symbolised in \nrubbish yet again!) seems to be equally apportioned by local people to themselves and to \ntourists from other parts of Romania.  Foreign tourists were seen as less likely to litter the \nenvironment.  As a teacher and long-term tour guide to the delta from Bucharest said, \n\u201cRomanians are not aware that they have to protect the environment everywhere they \ngo\u2026.The foreigners have respect for the environment.  They are aware of it and they don\u201ft \n  \n25 \nscatter anything.  They collect the plastic bags, ice cream wrappers, cola bottles, beer cans in \na special place.  The Romanians still have to learn.\u201d  Likewise, a local taverna owner \ndiscussed how he liked foreign tourists because they brought their rubbish back with them \nfrom the beach. \n The organised tour operators claimed that the tourists they brought to the delta did not \nleave rubbish.  This was partially due to them taking responsibility for their guests, collecting \ntheir rubbish and being with them throughout their visit.  Homestay providers did not have \nthe opportunity to watch over the activities of their guests in this way.  The aspirational, \nmoral virtue of eco-tourism was to the fore again in the view of one homestay provider \nequating it with not leaving rubbish behind and confining tourism activities to designated \nareas.  He also said that, despite these ideals, \u201c\u2026we cannot be with tourists every minute so \nsome tourists may behave unecologically and cause some damage to the environment.\u201d  \nThere was some controversy about access of tourists to restricted areas of the delta such as \nSachlin Island.  Local people were denied access to the island, but several respondents \nclaimed that some less scrupulous tour operators were organising landings there. \n Both hotel and homestay providers agreed that their preferred tourists were those who \nappreciated the delta\u201fs natural and cultural offerings.  One boat captain said, \u201cI really like the \npeople who come and ask questions about the delta, about the birds and animals that live \nhere.\u201d  Likewise, another tourist operator in Murighol said that people in search of discos and \nthe like were not her favourite guests.  Instead, \u201cthe real tourists are coming here to see the \nlandscape, to relax.\u201d  A homestay provider stated, \u201cI prefer the foreign tourists because they \nare more civilised, quiet people.  The Romanians are of many categories but the worst \ncategory is people who are very pretentious because they have money.\u201d  Such views about \nthe Romanian nouveau-riche were commonly expressed. \n Some of the village homestay providers had ideas about how tourism could develop \n  \n26 \nbased on what they had seen on television.  A school teacher discussed the possibilities for \nproviding tourists with opportunities to experience the traditional way of life, \u201c\u2026there are \npeople who pay a lot of money to go and live in the wilderness\u2026  I saw an American movie \nin which one of the visitors wanted to graze the cattle as it used to be done\u2026he was the main \nhero and he was on holiday.\u201d  It appeared that providers were becoming increasingly aware \nof the attractions of traditional architecture and livelihoods for tourists.  Another local \ntourism provider in Sf. Gheorgie said, \u201c\u2026the majority of them [tourists] are very interested to \nsee how the houses were decorated in the past and even to stay in those houses.\u201d Most of the \ntime however, eating locally produced vegetables and freshly caught fish was the extent to \nwhich traditional livelihoods impacted on tourism. \n Local people saw the development of homstay and alternative tourism in the Danube \ndelta as offering virtually its only hope of socio-economic progress, providing not only a \ndirect additional income to the households involved, but also the opportunity for young \npeople to stay in the delta, despite its lack of educational and other economic opportunities, \nand to learn languages by conversing with foreign tourists.  In response to the question of \nhow such tourism affects the local economy, comments such as \u201cit has a good effect\u201d and \n\u201cthe villagers do not have as many sources of income as in the past\u2026tourism represents a \ngood source of income\u201d were typical.  For some people, involvement in tourism had already \nbeen beneficial.  As a homestay provider said, \u201cYou can see how our house looks in \ncomparison with the others. We\u201fve earned enough money along the years to build a new \nhouse and to make some improvements.  My son has learned foreign languages working with \ntourists and that helped him to find a job.\u201d \n Most local people currently in the tourist business rely on tourism as one of a number \nof sources of livelihood.  As one village homestay hostess (a teacher) said, \u201cI would give up \nmy job at school and dedicate myself to tourism, but I can\u201ft as long as the profit is not very \n  \n27 \nbig. We have a family, a child who should go to school and we build all the time.\u201d  Only a \nfew have made hosting visitors their full-time occupation, as this homestay provider \nexplained: \n \n\u201cI\u201fve been a teacher at the local school for 15 years. I had to quit my job to have enough \ntime to spend for this \u201ebusiness\u201f and especially to look after my guests, to do everything \nto make them be satisfied with my services. My husband is a fisherman, so he has an \nactive \u201erole\u201f,  too. As you see, we have earned enough money from hosting tourists to \nextend the house and to build another house so I don\u201ft regret quitting my job. The success \nof our business it depends of course on the number of tourists we have and on external \nfactors which can be important\u2026like it was, for example, two years ago with the anthrax \nscare or the pollution from Baia Mare, etc.\u201d \n \nThis respondent complained of the high maintenance costs of their investment: \n \n\u201cYes, we have problems all the time - there is damp here - we are like on a floating land, \nand the houses deteriorate in time so we have to maintain and fix them all the time. The \nwalls crack here and there \u2026 no matter how well you build the land slides because of the \nwater whose level is not constant all the time. The land moves in winter too when the water \nfreezes because it is very cold. So, on one hand we make investments and on the other we \nspend a lot of money in maintaining the investment. So you get my point, in order to have a \nbig profit from tourism we must make big investments.\u201d \n \nThe Danube delta provides further evidence for the positive regard people have for homestay-\ntype ecotourism and the long tradition of homestay tourism in the area which augurs well for \n  \n28 \nits further development.  More conflicts are apparent between the tour providers in Tulcea \nand the people living in the Delta villages than is the case in Greece or Lithuania.  The long \ntradition of homestay tourism augurs well for the further development of this form of \necotourism, although infrastructural issues such as the establishment of communications and \nnetworks of providers over the enormous areas covered by the delta need to be resolved.   \n \nDiscussion \nThis paper has argued that we should not throw the baby of ecotourism out with the \nbathwater of irresponsible ecotourism practice.  The models of ecotourism, sustainable \ntourism and responsible tourism developed for the purpose of this project provided a heuristic \nway of thinking about ecotourism and what forms are best for local people, their \nenvironments, and indeed the tourists they serve.  What this study shows is that our \ninformants in the three European wetland areas considered were not unwilling recipients of \nexternally imposed tourism.  They were actively engaged in the discursive formation of \necotourism in its various manifestations, and were keen to recognise its development \npotential in what are otherwise economically marginal areas.  The elasticity of ecotourism as \nterm, far from rendering it meaningless, made it polysemic and multivocal.    \n People\u201fs conceptions were partly formed through their experiences (positive and \nnegative) of tourism in other places as well as their own environs, either first-hand or through \ntelevision and films.  These experiences were used to develop what they perceived as \ndesirable for their own area.  In many cases, ecotourism was held up as a contrast to \u201emass \ntourism\u201f, and a sense of moral virtue surrounded the term.  However, in people\u201fs discourse \nthe problem of rubbish, generally either self-generated or generated by same country \nnationals, cast an aspirational blight on the prospects for attracting people and maintaining \nthe beauty of the natural world.   \n  \n29 \n While there was the general hope that tourism could be developed, particularly for its \npotential to provide desperately needed jobs and to encourage young people to stay in the \narea, we did note that no-one in Greece, Lithuania or Romania who was not currently \ninvolved in tourism in some way discussed its development as a potential alternative source \nof livelihood for themselves, although everyone was willing to have more information and \ntraining opportunities in this field.  One problem identified by all stakeholders was the short \ntourist season and the need to develop facilities to attract tourists during the winter months.  \nFurthermore, as with many forms of development, there is a danger that the development of \necotourism will cause greater inequalities within communities, as can be seen nascently in \nRomania.      \n Through research on ecotourism in the three wetland sites, and specifically local \npeople\u201fs views and discourses surrounding it, this project has brought forward the research \nagenda for ecotourism.  In all three sites, the need for some kind of \u201efair trade\u201f approach to \ntourism, as Eades noted in Bosnia-Hergovina, was keenly perceived.  Homestay-type \narrangements were generally favoured, the exact format of the arrangement depending on the \nprevalent household structures and cultural attitudes towards dealing with guests.  Those \ninterviewed also differentiated strongly between different types of tourist, and had a notion of \nwhat sorts of tourist they wished to encourage and those they would like to see less of.  In all \ncases, the preferred type was the longer-staying, ecologically and culturally responsible \nindividual.  In terms of the typology of ecotourism developed for the project, the local people \nin European wetlands see responsible tourism as the way of the future.  \n  \n  \n \nWord Count: 8,466 \n   \n \n  \n30 \nAcknowledgements \nThis study is part of the \u201eIntegrated Management of European Wetlands\u201f (IMEW) Project, \nfunded by the European Union\u201fs Fifth Framework Research Programme (Contract EVK2-\nCT2000-22001).

The overall aim of this project was to investigate the conflict between conservation \npolicies and indigenous livelihoods in wetland areas through a nested set of work packages \nlooking simultaneously at local perceptions of the environment and conservation; biological \nperceptions of the environment; the engendering of environmental awareness, the \ninstitutional dynamics of wetland areas, and finally the potential for responsible tourism as a \nmeans of sustainable development of the wetland areas. \n2.  This is comparable with the distinction Grillo and Stirrat (1997) make between the \n\u201eanthropology of development\u201f and \u201eanthropology for development\u201f. \n3.
