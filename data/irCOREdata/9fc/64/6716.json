Brooks,\nNew York: Plenum, 1997. ISBN: 0-306-45552-8.\nPaperback, 214 pages. $30.\nAs a result of various paradigm shifts, the World\nWide Web (the Web) is changing both what we\nteach and how we teach it. Consequently, from\nthe point of view of distributing resources, we\nare now experiencing a significant change of\nemphasis - from instructor push towards student\npull. Web-Teaching is a book about teaching,\nespecially interactive teaching, using the Web as\na communications medium. It deals with the\nkinds of hardware, software and networks\ncommonly used on the Web to deliver and\nsupport instruction and learning. Overall, it has\ntwo basic thrusts: first, it gives descriptions of\nwhat is possible on the Web; second, it identifies\ninstructional strategies that are likely to be\neffective.\nThe book is organized into fourteen chapters, a\nreference section, a glossary, a software list and a\nset of URLs that are cited in various parts of the\ntext. Chapter 1 offers a basic introduction, both\nto the contents of the book and to Web\ntechnology. In Chapter 2 the author reviews \u2022\nrelevant dimensions of learning theory and\ndiscusses potentially useful research on teaching\nand learning. Chapters 3 to 7 provide an\noverview of what is currently possible on the\nWeb. These chapters are intended for those\nreaders who are starting out without much\nknowledge about technology beyond word-\nprocessing and email. The topics covered include\nmultimedia, Web-ready materials, and using\nimages, movies and other media.\nUnfortunately, using the Web for teaching and\nlearning does not automatically guard against\nthe creation of purely passive learning resources.\nTherefore, those wishing to use this type of\ntechnology to best advantage need to become\naware of strategies for introducing interactivity.\nChapters 8 to 10 address some of the major\nissues involved in developing interactive\nlearning. Chapter 8 focuses on strategies for\nsupporting both student-student and student-\nteacher discussion and debate via the Web.\nChapter 9 describes the use of HTML\n(HyperText Markup Language) forms for the\nsupport of automated interactive assessment,\nwhile Chapter 10 deals with mechanisms for the\npromotion of self-regulated learning (or student-\nmanaged learning).\nIn the following three chapters (11 to 13), the\nauthor focuses on various management topics\nrelated to the creation and maintenance of Web\nsites. As well as treating hardware and software\nissues, in these chapters he discusses the use of\nCD-ROM, intranets for electronic course\ndelivery, access control and security, and\nprotection of a Web site. The final chapter deals\nwith ways to use Web software to create\nmultimedia lectures for in-class use, and provides\nmany useful suggestions for setting up\nmultimedia rooms.\nAccording to the author, the intended audience\nfor the book includes teachers and trainers in\n63\nReviews\nhigh school, college, graduate school, in-service\neducation, professional development, adult\neducation and industry. One would therefore\nexpect it not to be over-technical, and indeed this\nis the case. But it contains a lot of useful\ninformation, and is easily readable. In fact, its\nonly (minor) shortcoming from the point of view\nof Windows users is that all the discussion and\nexamples relate to the Apple Macintosh. Despite\nthis, I am sure that Windows users will find the\ntechniques and principles of interest.\nPhilip Barker, University of Teesside\nDesigning Competence-Based Training by Shirley\nFletcher, London: Kogan Page, second edition,\n1997. ISBN: 0-7494-2196-7. Paperback, 86\npages. \u00a315.99.\nThis book makes an excellent, provocative\naddition to Kogan Page's Practical Trainer\nSeries. It is aimed at trainers who 'want to take a\nfresh approach and move away from traditional\nforms of training and development', and there is\nmuch to gain from it, for both the novice and the\nalready-committed.\nFor trainers and training manager it identifies\nopportunities to focus programmes on training\noutcomes rather than the delivery of content. It\nalso offers practical frameworks to develop\nprogrammes using a functional analysis\napproach rather than traditional task analyses.\nThe functional approach concentrates on\n'identifying the purpose of the organisation and\nits occupational roles together with the\nstandards expected of individual job holders'.\nThe results are that the responsibility for\ntraining is moved onto the individual trainee.\nImplications are that the training has to take\ninto account learning styles, learning strategies\nand individualized learning programmes.\nOne of the strengths of outcome-based training\nand development is that it is possible to employ\nas much or as little as you want at any time to\naugment existing courses or change whole\nprogrammes. This book is a first-rate example of\nsuch a flexible approach, making individual\nprocesses simple enough to understand and\napply but treating them with sufficiently\nthoroughness to facilitate the development of\nwhole frameworks. It is essential reading for\nanyone who is planning to adopt competence-\nbased training techniques in an organization. It\nis also excellent reading for those who wish to\nfind out about such training, whether they\nrequire in-depth procedures for implementation\n64\nor an overview of the whole topic.\nThe book is carefully structured, guiding the\nreader through five chapters beginning with\n'What is competence-based training?',\ncontinuing with chapters addressing standards\nand training design, and finishing with\n'Assessment, evaluation and accreditation'. Each\nchapter is headed by what the book terms a\n'summary', but which is really a list of expected\noutcomes for the chapter. A far better summary\nis provided by the 'review' at the end of every\nchapter. I can highly recommend the excellent\nForeword and Preface.\nSome of the early chapters pack an astonishing\namount of information into just a few pages:\nseveral scans might be required to assimilate\nsome of this material, particularly if you are\nunfamiliar with the jargon (there is a glossary at\nthe end of the book). Chapters 1 and 2 provide\nsolid background information, essential to the\nunderstanding of the rest of the book. Chapter 2\nincludes some interesting comparisons between\nUS and European systems, and a brief\ndiscussion of credit and credit accumulation in\nthe context of the qualification framework.\nChapter 3 introduces some useful examples of\nreal competence-based systems, and devotes\nmuch space to explaining how to carry out a\nfunctional analysis to arrive at your own\ncompetence standards. Such detail makes heavy\ngoing for newcomers; although a certain amount\nof explanation is necessary, more \u2022 emphasis\nmight perhaps have been placed on applying the\nexisting, nationally recognized standards now\navailable for many occupational areas. Some\nlarge organizations (for instance, BT) use these\nnational standards but augment them with their\nown and therefore make extensive use of\nfunctional analyses. Chapter 3 is rounded off\nwith two case studies featuring Whitbread\n(Cellar Service) and BT. These case studies are\ninvaluable, and I was disappointed not to see\nothers used elsewhere.\nThroughout the text there are numerous bulleted\nlists of activities and topics for consideration but\nonly in Chapters 2 and 4 are proper checklists\nsupplied. The provision of such checklists\nshould have been more consistent as there are\nvery many useful activities buried in the text as\nbullet points. If you are embarking on the\ndevelopment of competency-based training\nsystems, I would recommend the extraction of\nall these lists in their appropriate context.\nChapter 4 contains some examples of the sorts\nAa-J Volume 5 Number 3\nof paperwork that can be used to develop and\nsupport competence-based training systems. In\nparticular, the 'training design' and 'training\nmethod' matrices looked useful, but I confess to\nbeing a bit confused about their exact imple-\nmentation.\nAs with Chapter 4, Chapter 5 on assessment,\nevaluation and accreditation, could have usefully\nbeen enhanced with more examples of the\nresources which can be employed to enable these\nactivities. Although the final impression might\nbe one of burgeoning paperwork, the under-\npinning structure provided by the use of (for\nexample) planning and evaluation forms is\ncritical to competence-based training systems.\nThe discussion of evaluation in Chapter 5 is so\ncritical to the whole ethos of competence-based\nsystems that I was surprised that the chapter was\nso short. Evaluation is also missing completely\nfrom the key Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1, 'Model for\ncompetence-based training design'. This is rather\nunfortunate since, without evaluation, there is no\ntest of competence and therefore no complete\njustification of the system! As the author herself\nstates, training is only effective if it produces\nresults. Evaluation against the expected out-\ncomes of the training is the only way to measure\nresults. This demands a clear understanding of\nthe expected outcomes (why are you doing the\ntraining, how is it going to be applied) and a\nworkable method of evaluation. Once the\nstandards are clear and recording mechanisms\nare in place, assessment and accreditation can be\noffered as an integrated option. The NVQ\nsystem in the UK can work well within this\ncontext, despite some bad PR.\nThere is much interest in competence-based\nsystems, not necessarily under that name,\nparticularly in the higher-education sector with\nthe recent NCIHE report recommending the\nintegration into academic curricula of key skills\nand planning and recording of achievement.\nFrom page 1 this book helps dispel some potent\nmyths about competence-based training which\nmay help propagate its use not just in a work\nenvironment but also in higher education at all\nlevels.\nGive Betts, University of Exeter\nAdult Learning: A Reader edited by Peter\nSutherland, London: Kogan Page, 1996. ISBN: 0-\n7494-1971-7. Hardback, 208 pages. \u00a335.00.\nThe stated aim of this collection, edited by Peter\nSutherland who is a specialist in adult learning\nand cognitive development, is to explore\napproaches to teaching and learning appropriate\nto traditional and mature students in higher\neducation. The contributions are arranged into\nsix sections.\nSection I (on cognitive processes) has three\nchapters. Jack Mezirow reviews contemporary\nparadigms of learning and the current debate on\nthe nature and meaning of learning. Gillian\nBoulton-Lewis explores human information\nprocessing and aspects of memory, cognitive\ndevelopment with age and the implication for\nadult learning. Barry Dart considers meta-\ncognition and the use of metacognitive strategies\nby adult learners in higher education, stressing\nthe importance of reflecting upon, under-\nstanding and controlling learning in the context\nof complex cognitive activities and self-\ndirectedness.\nSection II (on learning and education) has four\nchapters. Paul Hettich reviews four\nepistemological theories of intellectual growth in\nadults. Ronald R Schmeck examines student\nindividuality and orientation to work, and its\ninfluence on learning tactics, pedagogic and\nandragogic approaches to teaching. Glyn Owens\nlooks at behaviourist approaches to adult\nlearning. Peter Sutherland (the editor) argues\nthat the concepts of constructivism\n('constructing a version of reality from [...]\nexperience') and experiential learning\n('constructivism in an adult context') can be\nblended into a fruitful union, particularly where\nthe teacher adopts andragogic strategies with\nstudents, negotiating assignment topics based on\ntheir prior experiences so as to enhance and\nextend established constructs.\nSection III (on adult learning in small-group\nsituations) contains only two contributions. Ian\nMowatt and Gerda Siann promote the benefits\nof learning in small groups, advocating the\nconsideration of knowledge, ability and skills of\nthe group participants, the purpose to which the\ndesired learning is directed, and the extent to\nwhich the needs of the individual members are\nmet by the group dynamics, and emphasis on the\nrole of the group as an instructional tool not as a\nrecreational activity in determining the quality\nof the learning outcomes achieved. Keith\nTopping considers the increased interest in peer-\ntutoring in post-16 education and its\neffectiveness as an alternative to traditional\ncurriculum delivery, and therefore as a strategy\n65\nReviews\nfor 'doing more with less'. Peer-tutoring is\nvaluable tool in the repertoire of adult educa-\ntors, promoting learner-managed learning and\nlearner empowerment. Topping stresses the need\nfor caution before seizing peer-tutoring as a\nuniversal, undifferentiated and instant panacea\nto the ills of higher education.\nSection IV (on the context of education) also has\nonly two contributions. Hitendra Pillay identifies\nemployer expectations and requisite skills for\neffective performance in the workplace, and in\nparticular the need for employees to be cross-\nskilled, high on up-skilling and able to engage in\nhigh-order thinking, a 'cocktail of abilities [...]\nknown as multi-skilling' which can be developed\nthrough training programmes and which 'ex-\nplicitly illustrate the connection of scientific\nprinciples and mathematical knowledge to work\npractice'. Loraine Blaxter, Christina Hughes and\nMalcolm Tight present as 'analytical vignettes'\nthe results of two projects, one looking at part-\ntime degree students, the at adults in six\nmedium-to-large organisations. Three broad con-\nclusions are reached: (i) that while many adults\nreject education in their early youth, full-time\neducation later assumes a more important, even\ncentral, role; (ii) that the links between education\nand other aspects of life (work, family, leisure) are\nmany and varied, and change over time, and while\nthese links are influenced by others (employers,\npartners), the real meaning comes from the\nindividual; (iii) that the success of cultivating a\nlearning culture must be judged by the extent to\nwhich individual perceptions are changed.\nSection V (on the particular context of the mature\nstudent in higher education) has four chapters.\nElizabeth Beaty and colleagues explore interviews\nwith female Open University students against a\nhierarchy of six different views of learning which\nculminate in personal transformation to achieve\nincreased competence and capability, confidence\nthrough the adoption of multiple perspectives\nand personal control to 'take hold of life and\nmake it go your way' - Mezirow's emancipation\n(Section I). There follow three papers with varied\napproaches to the issue of age as the dominant\nvariable in the mythology of perceived differences\nbetween mature and traditional students in higher\neducation. John Richardson rebuts the prevalent\nstereotype of mature students as inherently\nproblematic on three grounds: that there is no\nevidence of a deficit of study skills in mature\nstudents; that the deep approaches to learning of\nmature students are in fact compatible with the\nmission of higher education; that there is no\n66\nevidence to support the idea of age-related\ndeficits in the intellectual capacity requisite for\nhigher education. James Hartley and Mark\nTrueman reinforce the view that mature students\nare as variable a commodity as any other students\nwith differing goals for participation and social\nsituations, all of which impact on performance.\nStephen Newstead and colleagues identify three\nmotivational categories to study (stop-gap, means\nto an end, personal development) which dominate\nage in influencing differences between mature and\ntraditional students.\nSection VI (on implications for teaching)\ncontains just one contribution by Peter Suther-\nland himself. Drawing the collection together,\nSutherland uses the dichotomous model of\nteacher as pedagogue and andragogue to explore\nthe previous contributions in terms of their\npotential to develop metacognitive skills and\ndeep learning, and seeks to identify techniques\nwhich promote reflection - learning diaries, peer\ntutoring, etc.\nThe mission of higher education is to develop\ndeep approaches to learning, and requires the\ndevelopment of metacognitive strategies which\nmature learners participating for personal\ndevelopment are often able to demonstrate more\neasily than their traditional-age counterparts.\nHigher education today is played out against\nrising staff-student ratios and a decreasing unit\nof resource which mitigate against a focus on the\nindividual student. This book seeks to promote\nunderstanding and awareness of some of the\npotential strategies by which educators of adults\ncan seek to facilitate the connection between\ntheory and practice that promotes adult learning\nand multi-skilling.\nIt is a reader, not a primer, and will, in part, be\nreally useful only for those who have already\nstarted to consider the benefits and issues of\ninteracting with mature students and who, even\nthen, need to be equipped with a fairly powerful\ndictionary. Adult Learning is, however, as its dust\ncover suggests, 'an internationally accessible\ncollection', and will undoubtedly benefit all\nthose who teach adults.\nEleri Jones, University of Wales Institute, Cardiff\nDesign for Multimedia Learning by Tom Boyle,\nLondon: Prentice-Hall, 1997. ISBN: 0-13-\n242215-8. Hardback, 240 pages. \u00a329.95.\nDesign for Multimedia Learning covers all\naspects of the area from trends in multimedia\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 3\nlearning theory to conceptual and presentation\ndesign, along with information about\nmultimedia-resources project development and\nevaluation. The book comes somewhere between\na 'how to' technical manual and an overview of\ncurrent academic thought in the field. In the area\nof multimedia design, a broad cover of subjects\nis inevitable, and getting the balance right\nbetween depth and breadth cannot have been\neasy, but this book manages it. Its four main\nparts addresses the principal elements of the\nsubject in an informed manner.\nPart 1 charts the background to the 'multimedia\nlearning revolution', explaining the reasons why\nmultimedia learning is a growth area. Develop-\nments in student-centred learning are cited,\nalong with software developments such as the\nweb and affordable multimedia hardware, as\nreasons for this.\nPart 2 looks at strategic approaches to\neducational multimedia. A critique of current\nconstructivist learning theory is made, and a\nhistory of its roots in the procedural-based\napproach of CAI (computer-aided instruction).\nThe author asks if this new approach is 'too\nwoolly', and provides an interesting discussion\nabout the current conceptual design of multi-\nmedia learning environments, citing the\nestablishment of context in learning environ-\nments as crucial for learning advances.\nIlluminating points are made about using\nparadigms from film and linguistics for\nmultimedia. In film, for example, 'communica-\ntion spaces' are linked in the 'temporal domain',\nand similar links can be used in multimedia. The\ncomplexity of interactive media, and the\nimportance of maintaining coherence through\nuser-centred design, are recognized. The chapter\ndealing with 'design action potential' approaches\nthe structuring of content, and is the real heart of\nthe book. It contains pertinent observations on\nwhat is perhaps the hardest part of constructing\na multimedia learning environment: the\nstructure, especially for the novice designer.\nDifferent ways of thinking about structure in\nterms of hierarchy, networks and competency are\nexplored in some depth, with helpful diagrams.\nHowever, some of the discussion is made less\nelegant by the unfortunate term 'design action\npotential'. Action potential has a specific\nmeaning in biology; in this context it has a very\ndifferent meaning of 'potential for action'.\nElsewhere, the author describes this as the\navailable 'design options', which is perhaps a\nmore helpful phrase.\nIn Part 3, a holistic perspective on presentation\ndesign recognizes the close interrelation of and\nthe structuring and conceptual design of\nlearning environments. Comments about the\nprinciples of composition in terms of tone,\ncolour and balance are made, along with the\nimportance of creating a 'flow' of attention for\nthe user. The description of multimedia toolsets,\nmedia capture, editing and authoring tools will\ndate much more rapidly than other parts of the\nbook. It is, for instance, misleading for a new\ndeveloper to read that 8 Mb of RAM is specified\nfor a development machine (the specification\ncited is that of 1995) However, there is useful\nbackground information about the nature and\nuse of sound and digital video which should be\nuniversally applicable.\nPart 4 focuses on the area in which many\nmultimedia projects fail: their management and\nthe evaluation cycle. It outlines the iterative\nprototyping and evaluation process, and uses the\nexample of the Dynamic Systems Development\nMethod as a flexible method of project develop-\nment. This involves the analysis and specification\nof objectives, a vital but difficult part of the\nprocess. Strategic views of evaluation are\ncovered, there are notes on how to go about\ndeveloping questionnaires, and observation\nmethods are described. Delivery scenarios are\nexplored in terms of the total environment that\nthe software will be used in, and the importance\nof good packaging, installation and documenta-\ntion are summarized.\nThis book, covering every aspect that a designer\nshould consider, will be useful for anyone new to\ndeveloping multimedia learning, although, the\nfocus unfortunately tends to waver in places:\nsome things are skirted over, and sometimes\naspects that would be better placed in a technical\nmanual are gone into in detail. On occasion, too,\nthe figures and screen shots used to illustrate\npoints are fairly dry, and sometimes even\nmisleading. For example, in the chapter on\npresentation design, the importance of\ncomposition on the screen is discussed, along\nwith important notions of directing and\nmaintaining attention for the student. The\nimportance of balance and the use of a screen\ngrid to create consistency is addressed and a\nfigure showing blocked out areas for two\nidentical work areas on either side is used.\nSplitting the picture in half is visually difficult\nunless elements are balanced with stronger\nelements on one side or another. The author\ndoes mention balancing the screen using\n67\nReviews\npictures, but the example simplifies the notion of\ncomposition too much and could confuse the\nnovice reader. The subsequent example from the\nDOVE program is better, with its use of real\nimages. However, how the different elements\ninteract through colour, movement, tone and\nproportion is not properly explained. Again, in\nthe section on use of animation, the text\naccurately describes the importance of using\nanimation in context to enhance the learning\nobjectives, but the example given is poorly drawn\nand badly laid out. In fact, with the exception of\nthe Liverpool John Moores Cytofocus program\nand some other examples, the illustrations in the\nbook do not fully sample the now growing\nnumber of high-quality materials available in the\neducation and commercial arena. Surely a book\nabout good design should be an exemplar, and\nuse only the best examples to inspire and\nilluminate this subject for multimedia designers\nold and new? But perhaps this is a harsh\ncriticism of what is, on the whole, a very useful\nbook, and one which will be a welcome addition\nto a learning technologist's bookshelf.\nEmma Candy, University of Edinburgh\nResearching into Learning Resources in Colleges\nand Universities by Chris Higgins, Judy Reading\nand Paul Taylor, London: Kogan Page, 1996.\nISBN: 0-7494-1771-4, Paperback, 156 pages.\n\u00a314.99.\nThis book is part of The Practical Research\nSeries edited by Kate Ashcroft, aimed at teachers\nin further and higher education who are starting\nresearch into various aspects of teaching and\nlearning. It is designed to support both\n'reflective practitioners', taking a critical look at\ntheir own professional work, and those\nevaluating and researching education more\ngenerally. The books in this series, according to\nthe editor's introduction, combine practical\nadvice in research methods and design along\nwith suggestions for likely research topics. This\nmeans that this relatively slim volume combines\nsome aspects of a research methods manual with\nan introduction to some of the educational\nliterature pertinent to the use of learning\nresources.\nThe book starts with a lengthy introduction by\nthe series editor in which she outlines the\nphilosophy of the series. This is based on the\nidea of 'insider research' - researching the\nactivities and institution in which one works (or\nis otherwise involved). While this brings many\n68\nadvantages, such as good background\nknowledge and easy access, it also demands a\ncertain distancing, an open-mindedness, and\ncommitment and responsibility from the\nresearcher. Often such research involves just one\nresearcher, part-time, and the book essentially\naddresses the needs of such people. As Ashcroft\npoints out, this commonly means the research is\nsmall-scale, and even 'quick and dirty', and it is\nimportant not to claim spurious objectivity for\nresults. On the other hand, it can be treated as\naction research, in which results are fed back\nrapidly into (one's own) practice, and the\nresearch activity adjusted to accommodate the\nchanges.\nThe following six chapters are the meat of the\nbook. They cover the resource environment, the\ninstitutional context, the link between teaching\nand resources, the student as stakeholder, and\nevaluation of the resource environment. As can\nbe seen from this list, the contents are examined\nin a framework derived from the subjects being\nresearched, rather than - as is typical in research\nmethods books - around specific methods and\nstrategies. Throughout these chapters, there is\ncopious use of boxes and sidebars which contain\nmany practical suggestions for research and\nevaluation activities.\nIn Chapter 2, after introducing the concepts of\nresource-based, open, distance and flexible\nlearning, the authors discuss a range of\nresources based on new communication and\ninformation technologies (C&IT), along with\nmore traditional forms. The former includes the\nInternet, multimedia and conferencing; the\nlatter, reading lists, laboratories, audio-visual\nmaterials and libraries. These are dealt with only\nin outline, but as in other chapters, there is good\nreference to further reading.\nChapter 3 examines the wider, institutional\nframework within which resources are delivered.\nIn quick succession, the authors consider\nstructure and culture in institutions and their\nresponses to recent changes. They present three\nmethods of analysis based on systems analysis,\nopen systems and SWOT, and then discuss\nsupport staff, staff training and collaboration\nbetween institutions.\nIn contrast with the preceding chapter, Chapter\n4, on resources and teaching issues, takes a more\ntheoretical tack. It begins with a typology of\nCAL approaches which are explained by the\nfollowing sections on various theories of\nlearning, such as behaviourism, cognition and\nALT-} Volume 5 Number 3\nlearning styles. In consequence, the suggested\nresearch tasks are much better grounded and\naddress real conceptual issues.\nChapter 5 turns attention to the student's view of\nthings and, especially, to their needs and the\navailability of resources. Groups that receive\nparticular attention are part-time students,\ndistance learners and disabled students. This\nchapter contains the only (brief) reference to\ncost-effectiveness. This is a pity, given the\nemphasis now placed on the issue by many\ninstitutions and funding bodies, not least the\nTeaching and Learning Technology Programme\nphase III.\nThe last substantive chapter examines the more\ngeneral resource environment. Rather oddly, this\nstarts with a discussion of approaches to\nlearning (deep, surface, etc.) which would seem\nto belong with the discussion of theories of\nlearning in Chapter 4. There then follows a\nuseful discussion of teaching strategies includ-\ning reference to Laurillard's conversational\napproach.\nThe book ends with another substantial chapter\nby the series editor. This covers the issues of\nwriting and submitting research for publication.\nThe chapter contains a very useful listing of\neducational publishers, educational journals\n(including, of course, ALT-J) and other\neducation-related journals.\nDoes the book succeed in its attempt to review\nof research approaches and to consider the\nsubstantive issues resource-based learning\nraises? In the end, my feeling is that it does a\nbetter job of the latter than the former.\nAlthough the authors make plenty of reference\nin the annotated reading lists, and in many of\nthe boxes of research tasks, to further reading in\nresearch methods, I think that too often they\ngive the impression that research is mere\nobservation or data collection. There is little\nreference to careful analysis or to issues of\nreliability, validity, generalizability, and so on.\nThis is in marked contrast with the last chapter\nwhich gives the impression that reflective\npractitioners, who seem to be the readers\naddressed by most of the book, should be\ngetting their research published in academic\njournals. These journals are likely to demand\nmore than the mere stories which many of the\nresearch task boxes refer to.\nPerhaps, though, it is the last chapter that is out\nof line. Most of the book, in my view, forms an\nexcellent introduction to any teacher or lecturer\nreflecting on their practice for the first time,\nespecially if they have no background in\neducational or learning theory. In fact, if the\nproposal of the Dealing Report for teacher\ntraining in higher education is acted upon, the\nbook could be very timely in meeting the needs\nof teachers who might have to produce reflective\nportfolios for assessment.\nGraham R. Gibbs, University of Huddersfield\nFacing up to Radical Changes in Universities and\nColleges by Steve Armstrong, Gail Thompson and\nSally Brown, London: Kogan Page, 1997. ISBN:\n0-7494-2129-0, Paperback, 186 pages. \u00a318.99.\nThe past 10 to 15 years have seen significant\nchanges in higher education, and there have been\nmany factors which have had (and continue to\nhave) an impact on teaching and learning.\nFactors such as the level of national investment\nin education in real terms, huge growth in\nstudent numbers, the change in the type of\nstudent entering higher education, material\nbeing taught, unitization programmes, and the\ntechnology available for teaching, have all had\nan effect on the nature of teaching and learning.\nIn fact, the change in the nature of higher\neducation has meant that a veritable revolution\nhas been taking place. The book is published as\npart of the Staff and Educational Development\nAssociation's (SEDA) development series, and it\ngrasps the radical nature of the changes in\nhigher education and tackles clearly and\nconcisely issues very close to the heart of anyone\nworking within it. There are problems and issues\nexamined and discussed which will ring true with\npractitioners in higher education all over the\ncountry. One of the main benefits of texts like\nthis one is the realization for the reader that he\nor she is not alone. That in itself is reassuring,\nand gives the book great value.\nThe book, organized into four main sections, has\n18 chapters, each written by a different author,\nand the range of authors gives the book a\nvaluable breadth of experiences and opinions.\nTaken as a whole, it provides an interesting\nspectrum of perspectives, all moving towards the\ncentral theme, namely that since there is a huge\nand significant change taking place in higher\neducation, practitioners have much work to do\nin order to manage it. The book is clearly\nwritten, and the notes and reference sections at\nthe end of each chapter are very useful as\nindicators for further study.\n69\nReviews\nAfter a very perceptive introduction from Gail\nThompson, who discussed the current situation\nin higher education in the UK, the first section\n(Chapters 2 to 5) deals with the use of\ntechnology to support teaching and learning. It\nexamines many of the concepts and issues raised\nin the use of information technology as a means\nof dealing with the changes in higher education.\nThe blend of chapters very nicely links practical\nexamples with educational theory. The theme is\npositive throughout, and perhaps examination\nfrom another point of view (the dangers of\ninformation technology) would have given the\nsection even more balance.\nThe second section (Chapters 6 to 10) deal with\nthe strategies and policies in use in higher\neducation. Again, there is an interesting mix of\npractical example and theoretical discussion,\nand Chapter 10 introduces an interesting\nperspective: that of education managers.\nThe third section (Chapters 11 to 14) con-\ncentrates on dealing with the changes in the\nstudent population. This is a fascinating topic of\ndiscussion, where a tremendous amount of work\nwill need to be carried out in the next few years if\nhigher education is to prosper. The contributors\nto this section offer an insight into many of the\ncurrent student issues. The concept of an\neducator moving from an expert to a facilitator,\ntackled in Chapter 14 is particularly interesting.\nIn Chapters 15 to 17 (most of the final section)\nthere is a discussion of some of the measures\navailable to lecturers in coping with the changes\nin education. These are valuable insights based\non experience. The concept that the radical\nchanges in education will have to be met by\nradical changes in approach to teaching and\nlearning is a message which should become very\nclear in the next few years. Chapter 18, by Sally\nBrown, nicely pulls the whole book together in\nan interesting and informative manner.\nOverall, this book is an excellent addition to the\ngrowing library in the Staff and Educational\nDevelopment series. It is readable, and tackles\nmany of the issues and concerns shared by\npractitioners in UK higher education. The\ncontributors have used their experience to\ndiscuss and analyse the current position of\nhigher education, and to develop that under-\nstanding into a means of coping positively with\na future fraught with hurdles and difficulties. It\nis a text everyone working in higher education\nshould read if only to realize that the problems\nthey are facing are faced by others, and that\n70\npeople are putting forward ideas which will\nallow us to cope with radical change.\nAlastair Irons, University of Northumbria at\nNewcastle\nTechnology-Based Training - A Comprehensive\nGuide to Choosing, Managing, Implementing and\nDeveloping New Technologies in Training by\nSerge Ravet and Maureen Layte, London: Kogan\nPage, 1997. ISBN: 0-7494-1975-X. Hardback,\n306 pages. \u00a335.00.\n'Technology' and 'Training' are words which are\nused in many and varied contexts. Therefore, the\ntask of writing a single text to synthesize current\ninformation about the uses of technology in\ntraining is enormous, and brings to this book\nboth its principal strength and its principal\nweakness. As a broad introduction to\ntechnology-based training (TBT), the coverage\ntackled by the authors is commendable, and there\nare plenty of pointers to examples and further\ninformation. There need to be. Anyone seeking\ndepth of knowledge may feel disappointed and\nfrustrated with the lack of detail.\nThe book has four sections, each divided into\nmanageable chunks, with good use of tabulated\nsummaries and illustrated with case studies or\nexamples easily identified by their boxed\npresentation. But exactly what the authors\nintend or mean by training is not specified; the\nemphasis seems to be on training within a work\ncontext, but many examples and case studies are\ndrawn from formal educational settings.\nThe first section looks at the context of\ntechnology and the impact it has on everyday\nlife, and at its advantages as a training medium,\nthe list presented being familiar and unad-\nventurous. The term 'computence' is introduced\nto mean the competence of the computer to\nexecute certain tasks.\nSection 2 discusses the merits of using\nmultimedia as a training medium. The Internet\nis described, and Chapter 5 includes a full-page\nintroduction to hypertext aimed at novices, but\nby Chapter 7 the reader is expected to under-\nstand object-orientated programming, Java and\nvirtual reality, each of which are discussed with\nlittle or no explanation beyond the terms\nthemselves. Chapter 8, however, is most wel-\ncome, addressing issues so often omitted from\ntexts in this area: using technology to empower\nand facilitate access to learning for individuals\nwith disability.\nAn-J Volume 5 Number 3\nThe remaining two sections look at the issues\nsurrounding the design and development of\ncomputer-based training packages. Important\ndesign factors are identified, and the skills\nneeded among all members of a design team are\nclearly presented. Legal considerations, such as\ncopyright and data protection, are mentioned in\ndifferent chapters of this section, but once again\ndetail is somewhat scarce. Chapter 14 describes a\ntypical multimedia workstation, starting with\ndefinitions of the role of the CPU, ROM and\nRAM, moving on through modems (apparently\nthe only means of getting access to the Internet)\nto a basic list of common input devices. The\nfollowing chapter deals with network issues,\nmentioning bandwidth, computer conferencing\nand different network structures. Authoring\ntools are compared in general terms, and a\nchecklist of useful features presented for\nconsideration. In Section 4, on design principles\nand methods, five layers of TBT are defined and\ndescribed: model, process, knowledge, resources\nand guide, which all interact with a user-\ninterface. Each element is discussed in turn, with\ngeneral issues, particularly simulations, being\ntackled at the end.\nThe book finishes with a series of short\ninformation sections: useful addresses (all but one\nin the UK), more than eight pages of useful\nURLs, grouped into sections (any list of this\nnature is always likely to be incomplete and out of\ndate, but it seems peculiar that TLTP and CTI\nmerit no more than a passing mention, and that\nthere is only a single contribution under the\nheading of computer-assisted assessment);\nauthoring and development tools (listing the\nprincipal features of each); a glossary of terms; a\nbibliography; and suggestions for further reading.\nThe case studies and examples presented\nthroughout the book are generally useful\nadditions, but I was frustrated by the attempt to\ncover both sides of the Atlantic. I found myself\nwondering whether the book is aimed at a US or\na European market.\nHowever, the book provides a useful\nintroduction to the use of computers as a\ntraining medium (even if I remain to be\nconvinced that TBT in education and commerce\ncan really be tackled as a single issue). It is\nwritten in a clear, flowing and relaxed style, and\nis nicely laid out. It is likely to prove most\nappropriate to those with an early and general\ninterest in the uses of technology for training,\nrather than those who already have a\nprofessional involvement. The claim on the\ncover that it is 'a comprehensive guide to\nchoosing, implementing, managing and\ndeveloping new technologies in training' may be\njustified, but perhaps it would have more\nappropriate to present such a guide in four\nseparate, detailed volumes, where the many\nserious and interesting issues could have been\naddressed in a more challenging - and more\nmemorable - form.\nNora Mogey, Heriot-Watt University\nImplementing Computer-Supported Co-operative\nLearning by David McConnell, London: Kogan\nPage, 1994. ISBN: 0-7494-1237-2. Hardback,\n220 pages. \u00a334.00.\nThis book discusses the use of computers to\ncreate collaborative environments that support\nthe process of learning - a very topical subject\nsince, certainly within both further and higher\neducation, there is a great deal of interest in how\nto support students who ate learning\nindependently or at a distance. The role that\ntechnology can play in independent learning is\nthe subject of much debate, both in terms of the\nunderpinning infrastructure needed and the\npedagogy and educational approaches which it\ncould enable. I was keen to see what this book,\nby someone with extensive experience in this\narea, could add to my understanding of the\nsubject. I was somewhat disappointed, but this\nstatement requires some qualification.\nThe book is nicely structured, and each chapter\ncarefully introduces the topic to be developed in\nthe context of what has gone before.'The reader\nis never in any doubt where the specific chapter\nis going or how it relates to the rest of the book.\nI found this particularly helpful since the book\nitself is broad ranging and, at times, I wanted to\nbe more selective about the topic I was\nfollowing.\nChapter 1 introduces the concept of co-\noperative learning, not from a technology\nperspective, but focused on the learning process,\nthe way in which individuals can work as a\ngroup, and the possible beneficial outcomes of\nmaking learning a group activity. There is a\nsmattering of educationalist jargon, but not\nenough to make the thrust of the argument\ninaccessible to a lay reader.\nThe stage having been set, Chapter 2 goes on to\ndiscuss the technologies which can support co-\noperative learning, particularly group working.\n71\nReviews\nMcConnell discusses the possible classification\nof computer-supported co-operative learning\n(CSCL) into a number of different categories\nbased on the form of the interaction, the\ngeographical location of the users and the degree\nof structure imposed by the system. A point\nwhich McConnell makes, and with which I\ntotally agree, is that the real costs of imple-\nmenting CSCL lie in the development of the\npedagogy and the development of materials\nrather than in the computers themselves. The\nweakness of this chapter, and also the later\nsections of other chapters that illustrate the use\nof the technology, is that the book was published\nin 1994 and the technologies referred to are\nalready very out of date.\nChapter 3 looks at the way in which people work\ntogether in online environments, either as peer\ngroups or in a tutor-student relationship. The\nchapter is based on the author's own experiences,\nand gives a useful insight into the dynamics of\nworking in this way. Particularly interesting is\nthe analytical comparison of the strengths and\nweaknesses of face-to-face and virtual student\ngroups.\nHaving covered these important issues the\nauthor goes on, in Chapter 4, to discuss the\ndifferent ways in which courses need to be\ndesigned in order to maximize their success\nwhen delivered using CSCL. This chapter draws\nheavily on research into the differences between\ntraditional (didactic) and co-operative learning\nand, rightly, concentrates on examining the\nlearning process in a generic way rather than\nusing technology as the driving force for\nredesigning courses. The problem with this\napproach, however, is that McConnell is then in\ncompetition with other, more established,\nauthorities who publish books on the learning\nprocess.\nChapter 5 allows the author to describe the use\nof CSCL within an open-learning MA in\nManagement Learning. This case-study\napproach allows us an insight into the attitudes\nand responses of the students engaged in the\ncourse, and is a clear and informative example of\ntheory into practice. It also looks at the role of\nthe online tutors and their experiences of\nteaching in this new medium. The limitation,\nagain, is that the case study is based on out-of-\ndate technology, although much of the\ndiscussion still has relevance.\nFor the same reason Chapter 6 is largely\nredundant, dealing as it does with 'recent'\ndevelopments in the technologies for CSCL. The\nfinal chapter looks at ways of researching group-\nwork in CSCL environments. The author, quite\nrightly, considers that there are a number of\nimportant questions about CSCL which need to\nbe answered, and proposes a structure in which\nthis could be accomplished. Granted, much of\nthis has been attempted since the book was\npublished, but it is interesting to look down the\nlist of questions and note how many still do not\nhave definitive answers.\nSo, I found this book interesting, but disappoint-\ning. The discussions concerning the way in which\ncourses need to be designed for CSCL, and the\nunderlying pedagogy of such an approach to\nopen, independent learning are useful, but can\nlargely be found in any of the recent books\ndealing with open and flexible learning. The\ndiscussions about the technology itself are now\nout of date and potentially misleading to the\nuninformed. The title of the book implies a\npractical guide to the use of CSCL although in\nreality it is a useful review of the issues\nsurrounding its use. Of course, it is not fair to\nthe author to be too critical of a book which\npublished three years ago and which draws on\nwork that he had previously published elsewhere\nthe year before that. However, taken overall, I\ncould not really recommend this text as a good\nstarting point for someone interested in\ndeveloping courses which use CSCL.\nC.J. Wookton, University of Hull\n"}
