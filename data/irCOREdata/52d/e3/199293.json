This article is an attempt to rescue revolution, both as concept and practice, from the\ntriumphalism of the contemporary world. To that end, the article uses three transformations\nfrom authoritarian rule \u2013 the end of apartheid in South Africa, the collapse of communism in\nthe Czech Republic and the transition from military dictatorship to market democracy in\npost-Pinochet Chile \u2013 in order to test the ways in which these contemporary manifestations of\nradical change compare and contrast with past examples of revolution. Although these cases\nshare some core similarities with revolutions of the modern era, they also differ from them in\nfive crucial ways: the particular role played by the \u2018international\u2019 and the state, the nature of\nviolence, the use of ideology, and the process of negotiation itself. As such, they signify a novel\nprocess in world politics, that of negotiated revolution.\nThe two faces of revolution\nRevolutions, like the temple of Janus, have two faces. One is an elegant, abstract and\nhumanitarian face, an idyllic face, the dream of revolution and its meaning under the calm\ndistancing of eternity. The other is crude, violent and very concrete, rather nightmarish, with\nall the hypnotic power, loss of perspective and breadth of understanding you might expect to\ngo with nightmares.1\nFrom the time of the great exchanges between Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke\nover the sanctity or barbarism of the French Revolution, scholars have disagreed\nfundamentally over what John Dunn calls the \u2018two faces of revolution\u2019. For an\nactivist like Paine, revolutions were \u2018a renovation of the natural order of things, a\nsystem of principles as universal as truth and the existence of man, and combining\nmoral with political happiness and national prosperity\u2019.2 Revolutions symbolised the\nmarch of progress and rationality, of irresistible and irreversible change. But for\nBurke, a staunch critic of the events of 1789, the revolution was nothing more than\na \u2018monstrous, tragic-comic scene\u2019 with potentially fatal consequences for the future\nof Europe.3\nIn reality, revolutions neither fulfil the expectations of the romantics who advocate\nthem, nor become the dystopia feared by those who promote their overthrow. In\norder to understand the significance of revolutions \u2013 in this age or any other \u2013 it is\nimportant to cut a swathe through both of these myths: the exaggerated fantasies of\nrevolutionaries themselves and the claims of those, often conservative, thinkers who\n1 John Dunn, Modern Revolutions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), p. 4.\n2 Thomas Paine, Rights of Man, (London: Orion, 1993), p. 103.\n3 Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press,\n2003), p. 12.\n473\ndeny the importance of revolutions to domestic societies or to international relations.\nRevolutions do not start history afresh from a fictitious year zero nor can they be\nreduced to mere trifles or footnotes in history. Revolutions have a formative effect on\nthe particular societies where the changes occur and on the wider international\nrelations with which they interact. Yet, in reality, much of the new order is curtailed\nby old-regime structures and many elements of the revolutionary programme are\nnever initiated in the first place.\nIn the present day, a great deal of the passion and drama that characterised the\ngreat debate about the two faces of revolution seems strangely out of place. To all\nintents and purposes, the age of revolutions has been consigned to the archives. Even\none of the theorists most attuned to the formative impact of revolution on world\npolitics, Fred Halliday, subtitles his most recent book on the subject, The Rise and\nFall of the Sixth Great Power. The term revolution has been reduced to a sound bite,\nmore often a means to peddle magazines, sell cars or spin policy proposals than act\nas a call to action. Revolutions appear to have little place amidst the apathy and\nweariness of mainstream political discourse in advanced market democracies. In an\nera seemingly best captured by Fukuyama\u2019s infamous phrase \u2018the end of history\u2019,\nrevolutions have been tamed and commodified, becoming irrelevant to a world in\nwhich the big issues of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have been settled.4\nThis article is an attempt to rescue revolution, both as concept and practice, from\nthe triumphalism of the contemporary world. There are two main reasons why it is\nwrong to write off either the study or the practice of revolution. First, as Martin\nWight points out, over half of the last five hundred years have featured some kind of\nconflict between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary states.5 From the \u2018Revolt\nof the Netherlands\u2019 (1566\u20131609), to the \u2018Springtime of Nations\u2019 (1848), revolutions\nhave played a central, constitutive role in the making of the modern international\nsystem. The twentieth century, perhaps more than any other epoch in world history,\nwas consistently punctuated by revolutions \u2013 social upheavals in the early part of the\ncentury in Russia, Mexico, Persia and Turkey were followed by uprisings in China,\nAlgeria, Cuba, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Iran, Nicaragua and elsewhere during the Cold\nWar.6 Indeed, much of the drama of world politics between 1945 and 1989 was\nplayed out through processes of revolution and counter-revolution.7 As Fred\nHalliday writes, \u2018revolutions were not mistakes or detours but part of the formation\nof the modern world\u2019.8\nSince the end of the Cold War, the dream of a new world order founded on peace,\nprosperity and security has floundered in many parts of the world. A decade or so on\nfrom the apparent triumph of Western market democracy, world politics is marked\nby turbulence and instability. In the former Soviet states of Central Asia, a disturbing\nm\u00e9lange of oligarchs, mafiosos and former party cadres are carving up the spoils of\na failed transition. In Latin America, populists, past dictators and strongmen are\n4 Francis Fukuyama, The End of History and the Last Man (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1992).\n5 Martin Wight, Power Politics (London: Penguin, 1978).\n6 Using fairly demanding criteria, John Foran calculates that there were 31 revolutions in the\ntwentieth century. For more on this, see John Foran (ed.), The Future of Revolutions (London: Zed\nBooks, 2003).\n7 Barry M. Schutz and Robert O. Slater (eds.), Revolution in the Third World (Boulder, CO: Lynne\nRienner, 1990).\n8 Fred Halliday, Revolution and World Politics: The Rise and Fall of the Sixth Great Power (London:\nMacmillan, 1999), p. 331.\n474 George Lawson\nreturning via the ballot box.9 Armed conflict continues to plague Africa, from the\nGreat Lakes to the Horn. In South-Eastern Europe, a decade of war has left a\ndevastating legacy on the social, economic and political landscape of much of the\nregion.10 Fundamentalist groups of various hues question the very foundations of\nmodernity.\nThere is, as yet, no concrete understanding or general agreement about the\npredominant features of contemporary international relations. Questions loom large\nover whether the world is operating under the suzerainty of an American empire, if\nthere is an imminent multipolarity marked by the rise of global institutions and\norganisations, or whether the fundamental challenge of the epoch is a clash between\nradically divergent views of modernity. Furthermore, the pressing concerns facing the\nworld \u2013 civil conflict, poverty, inequality, disease, social dislocation and environ-\nmental degradation \u2013 hint at the continuing salience of radical change.11 Given, then,\nboth the relative openness and uncertainty which characterise the structural con-\nditions of the contemporary era and the persistent conflicts which mar world politics,\nit seems strangely remiss to ignore the process which, throughout history, has had\nsuch a foundational influence on world politics and which remains, both as aspiration\nand practice, so relevant to the study and practice of international relations. Hegel\nargued that the ebbs and flows of world affairs tended to obscure, or even run\ncounter, to attempts at controlling (or theorising) them. Both the instability of\ncontemporary world politics and the eternal cunning of history make studying\nrevolutions a timely venture.\nThe second point about the importance of revolution to the modern world is more\ntheoretical. Many of those scholars who deny the importance of revolution to the\ncontemporary world do so because they mistakenly equate revolutions with certain\ninalienable, essential features: class-based, violent, utopian and so forth. For the most\npart, revolutions are ascribed certain core features, masquerading as objective\ncriteria, without which they are considered to be \u2018invalid\u2019. Such a view is misguided\nbecause it reduces revolutions to static objects of analysis rather than seeing them as\ndynamic processes with features that change according to their historical and social\n9 This trend is best epitomised by the example of Hugo Chavez, a former Venezuelan paratrooper\nwho returned as president in 1998, six years after he had conducted an attempted coup, in order to\nlead a \u2018peaceful revolution\u2019 against the \u2018rancid oligarchs\u2019 and \u2018squealing pigs\u2019 of the old regime. But\nother examples are also pertinent \u2013 the former dictator of Bolivia, Hugo Banzer, was re-elected as\npresident in 1997. Since Banzer\u2019s death in 2002, the country has witnessed a period of some\nturbulence, exemplified by the coup in October 2003 against the regime headed by Gonzalo Sanchez\nde Lozada. In Peru, Alberto Fujimori\u2019s period in office ended in 2000 with his forced exile amidst a\nwelter of political and financial scandals. His successor, Alejandro Toledo, was forced to declare a\nstate of emergency in 2002 as a result of increasingly violent grass roots protests. The current\ninstability which mars Ecuador and Argentina, along with Colombia\u2019s longer-term volatility, serve\nas potent examples of the region\u2019s unsteady milieu. For more on this, see Michael Shifter,\n\u2018Breakdown in the Andes\u2019, Foreign Affairs, 83:5 (2004).\n10 Although many states in the region, among them Serbia, Croatia and Kosovo, now bear the\ntrappings of formal democracy, the region remains mired in deep-seated problems from which it will\nbe difficult to recover, not least among them the spectre of a return to populist, authoritarian rule.\n11 There is also a demographic factor behind the continuing importance of radical change to the\ncontemporary world. As David Willetts points out, of the world\u2019s twenty-five most youthful\ncountries, sixteen have experienced major civil conflict since 1995. The average age in China at the\ntime of the revolution was nineteen, in Iran at the time of the Shah\u2019s overthrow, it was seventeen.\nConversely, of countries with the oldest populations in the world, only Croatia has experienced\nserious conflict over the last fifteen years. For more on this, see David Willetts, \u2018Too Many Kids\u2019,\nProspect, October 2003, p. 18.\nNegotiated revolutions 475\ncontexts. The concept of revolution exists in every major language group in the\nworld \u2013 its heritage is diverse, drawn from a variety of cultural settings. As such, a\nstudy of its etymology would need to include the Greek concepts of epanastasis\n(revolt) and neoterismos (innovation), the Arabic terms inqilab (to rotate) and thaura\n(to revolt), the notions of mered (rebellion), kom (uprising), marah (revolt) and kesher\n(plot) in classical Hebrew, and the Chinese word ge-ming (change of life, fate or\ndestiny).12 In Europe, revolution \u2013 derived from the Latin verb revolvere \u2013\ntraditionally evoked a return to a previous order, for example the restoration of\nconstitutional monarchy witnessed by the Glorious Revolution in England in 1688.\nOver the last two hundred years, deriving in part from the work of Montesquieu,\nVoltaire and Rousseau, the idea of revolution has become more circumscribed.\nDuring this period, revolutions came to be seen as volcanic ruptures, quasi-\nastronomical realignments, sharp breaks with the past from which societies could not\nturn back. In this way, the English Civil War of the 1640s was reinterpreted as a\nrevolution during the eighteenth century, as was the Revolt of the Netherlands and,\nlater on, the American War of Independence. After the French Revolution, the\nconcept of revolution took on a kind of transcendental, metahistorical tilt that\nuniversalised, naturalised and ultimately, mythologised, the revolutionary experi-\nence.13 The vision of a utopian future became inexorably tied to the concept of\nrevolution as did the notions of violence, and inevitable and total change. Each\ngeneration of revolutionary scholarship subscribed to this essentialist view, in a sense\nbuying into the romantic fantasies of revolutionaries themselves. Rather than looking\nfor similarities in revolutionary ideology, advocates fetishised revolutionary rhetoric.\nRather than studying closely the relationship between violence and revolution, the\nlatter became associated only with glorious fights to the finish in which the old order\nwould surrender to the might and right of the revolutionary armies. Revolution\nbecame an almost metaphysical category, an invented social concept that bore little\nresemblance to actual experience.\nMuch of this \u2018essentialising\u2019 stemmed from a romanticism that equated revolu-\ntions with heroic fights to the finish in which nothing less than \u2018death or liberty\u2019\nwould suffice. This disguised a much more complex relationship between revolutions\nand violence than is usually understood. Often, revolutions have been relatively\npeaceful seizures of power. Violence stemmed, for the most part, from battles after\nthe initial takeover of state power, resulting from the need by revolutionary regimes\nto shore up their rule in the face of domestic and international attempts at\ncounter-revolution, a cycle that can be observed in France (in particular in the\nVend\u00e9e) after 1791, Russia during its four-year long civil war after 1921, and in Iran,\nby way of its war with Iraq and the brutal measures employed against the regime\u2019s\n\u2018un-Islamic\u2019 foes after 1980. Nor have the revolutionary ideologies that ignited these\nstruggles always been the novel utopian visions that their champions proclaimed.\nThird World revolutionaries from Mao to Castro, and Neto to Cabral have fused a\nbasic grounding in Marxism with a dash of nationalism, and an occasional sprinkling\nof messianic, populist fervour. Even the leaders of the \u2018great revolutions\u2019 in France,\nChina and Russia looked to the past as well as to a vision of a pristine future in order\n12 On this, see Halliday, Revolution and World Politics.\n13 For more on this, see Hannah Arendt, On Revolution (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1963), and\nKrishan Kumar, 1989: Revolutionary Ideas and Ideals (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota\nPress, 2001).\n476 George Lawson\nto justify their revolt. To be revolutionary, therefore, ideas do not necessarily have to\nprovide some new set of original precepts. Rather, revolutionary ideology coalesces\naround a fertile blend of the time-honoured and the novel, inspirations to action in\na given historical context. In this way, older ideals of freedom, justice and equality are\njust as much part of revolutionary rhetoric as any claims of remaking the world anew.\nSimilarly, revolutionary victory has not been as total as is often imagined. Even the\nparadigmatic revolution of the modern era in France was, to some extent, overturned\nby the restoration of the Bourbons in 1815; many of the families who enjoyed\npositions of influence under the ancien r\u00e9gime retained their privileges during the first\nhalf of the nineteenth century.14 The \u2018weight of habit\u2019, institutions and moeurs of the\nold regime became reinvested in the new order in France, as in Russia, Mexico,\nChina, Indochina, Iran, Nicaragua, Angola and elsewhere.\nIt is difficult, therefore, to isolate any single characteristic that runs as a constant\nthrough all instances of revolution over time and place: revolutions have been\nconducted by nationalists, peasants, communists, radical military groups, liberals\nand religious fundamentalists. Beneath the generic category of revolution lies\nconsiderable variation in terms of the roles of violence and innovative ideology, and\nin the overall outcomes of revolutions. There is not, nor can there be, any universal\nquality or image that encapsulates this surfeit of characteristics. Revolutions are thus\nbetter seen as dynamic processes with features contingent on both their world-\nhistorical context and their particular social setting. As such, there is no theoretical\nreason to suggest that revolution cannot take a contemporary form in keeping with\nan era marked by globalisation and heteronomy. This form, I argue, is \u2018negotiated\nrevolution\u2019.\nThe term \u2018negotiated revolution\u2019 was first used in a book of that title written in\n1993 by two eminent South African scholars, Heribert Adam and Kogila Moodley.\nIt was further popularised in South Africa by the journalist Allister Sparks, who used\nthe term as the subtitle of his investigation into the secret talks between the apartheid\nregime and ANC leaders prior to the release of Nelson Mandela in 1990. Farther\nafield, the Hungarian social scientist, Gustav T\u00f6k\u00e9s, used \u2018negotiated revolution\u2019 to\ndescribe the elite-controlled transition from communism to market democracy in\nHungary. Outside these two area-specific settings, the concept has featured in some\ngeneral literature on democratic transitions.15 This article both builds on and extends\nthis legacy.16\n14 Tocqueville was so taken with this restoration that, writing in 1852, he claimed \u2018nothing, or almost\nnothing has changed since 1789\u2019. Alexis de Tocqueville, The Ancien R\u00e9gime and the French\nRevolution (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1998), p. 8.\n15 See Heribert Adam and Kogila Moodley, Negotiated Revolution: Society and Politics in\nPost-Apartheid South Africa (Johannesburg: Jonathan Ball, 1993); Allister Sparks, Tomorrow is\nAnother Country: The Inside Story of South Africa\u2019s Negotiated Revolution (London: Heinemann,\n1995); Rudolf T\u00f6k\u00e9s, Hungary\u2019s Negotiated Revolution (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n1996); and Michael Kennedy, \u2018Towards a Theory and Practice of Negotiating Revolution\u2019, Eastern\nEuropean Politics and Society, 13:2 (1999).\n16 This article draws on a comparative research project into three contemporary transformations: the\ncollapse of communism in the Czech Republic; the end of apartheid in South Africa; and the fall of\nthe Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. The Czech Republic is defined as having undergone a negotiated\nrevolution in a \u2018maximum\u2019 sense because of the systemic transformation of its principal political,\neconomic and social institutions since 1989. The South African case warrants the label \u2018minimum\u2019\ntransformation because some of the structures inherited from the apartheid regime (in particular\neconomic institutions), have been difficult to break and remould. Chile is considered to be a case of\ntransition rather than revolution, negotiated or otherwise, because while some important social,\nNegotiated revolutions 477\nNegotiated revolutions\nMany theorists contend that \u2018modern revolutions\u2019, the type ushered in by the French\nRevolution a little over two centuries ago, pass through a series of stages. Crane\nBrinton, for example, bases his analysis of revolutionary anatomy on the path of the\nFrench Revolution from an initial period of moderation to the \u2018Terror\u2019 of the\nJacobins and the \u2018Thermidor\u2019 of July 1794.17 Jaroslav Krejc\u02c7\u00ed, in turn, argues that\nrevolutions pass through a number of stages: onset, compression, explosion,\noscillation, expansion, tightening, reversal, restoration and consolidation.18 In\nnumerous texts, Fred Halliday refers to the modularity of revolutionary outcomes as\nconstituting, in turn: a period of grace, domestic radicalism, accommodation and\ninstability.19 It is important to be careful about extrapolating in this way from one\nrevolution to another without recourse to contingency and particularity; if history\ntells us anything, it is to be cautious when employing terms like generality and\nnecessity. Yet, there are some general features that can be extrapolated from modern\nrevolutions: causes rooted in systemic crisis; the development of a condition of\nmultiple sovereignty; a call to arms based on a utopian vision; a takeover of state\ninstitutions; the attempt to export revolution internationally; counter-revolution; and\nthe growth of stronger, more bureaucratic, often tyrannical states.20 To somewhat\nabridge a concept from Schumpeter, revolutions are processes first of creative\ndestruction and secondly of destructive creation.\nNegotiated revolutions are like these \u2018modern revolutions\u2019 in three main ways.\nFirst, they are conjunctural processes that take place when two conditions above all\nare met: rulers can no longer rule and the ruled will no longer go on being ruled\nin the same way. Vladimir Ili\u2019ch Lenin, perhaps the archetypal revolutionary,\nunderstood this well:\nThe fundamental law of revolution is as follows: for a revolution to take place it is not enough\nfor the exploited and the oppressed masses to realise the impossibility of living in the old way;\nfor a revolution to take place it is essential that the exploiters should not be able to live and\nrule in the old way. It is only when the lower classes do not want to live in the old way and the\nupper classes cannot carry on in the old way that the revolution can triumph.21\nRevolutions are rooted in both long-term trends and short-term sparks, complex\namalgams of systemic crisis, structural opening and collective action. Revolutions\ncome about through a multiplicity of long-term and short-term factors, including\npolitical and economic changes have taken place since 1989, these have largely been contained\nwithin the \u2018authoritarian enclaves\u2019 prescribed by the outgoing junta. These three cases are used in\nthis article as the principal empirical material by which to test and illustrate the theoretical claims.\nGeorge Lawson, Negotiated Revolutions: The Czech Republic, South Africa and Chile (Aldershot:\nAshgate, 2005). On the \u2018maximum\u2019 and \u2018minimum\u2019 dimensions of revolutionary change, see Eric\nHobsbawm, Revolutionaries: Contemporary Essays (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1973).\n17 Crane Brinton, The Anatomy of Revolution (New York: Vintage, 1965).\n18 Jaroslav Krejc\u02c7\u00ed, Great Revolutions Compared: The Outline of a Theory (Hemel Hempstead: Harvester\nWheatsheaf, 1994).\n19 See, for example, Fred Halliday, Rethinking International Relations (London: Macmillan, 1994),\nChapter 6.\n20 Even within such a loose taxonomy, there are still exceptions. For example, the Mexican Revolution\nwas an uprising against an authoritarian regime rather than a movement for an alternative utopian\nfuture, at least until the intervention of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas del R\u00edo and his nationalisation drive\nduring the late 1930s.\n21 Vladimir Ili\u2019ch Lenin, On Culture and Cultural Revolution (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1970),\np. 94.\n478 George Lawson\ninternational, economic, political and social factors. For John Foran, understanding\nrevolutions in this way, as conjunctural phenomena, characterises \u2018fourth generation\u2019\napproaches to the study of revolutions.22\nSecond, although as pointed out above, revolutions take on various forms\naccording to time and place, they do share a sociological logic. Rather than\nfocusing on ascribed characteristics that can only deliver a static snap-shot of\nparticular cases of revolution without comparative purchase, fourth-generation\napproaches adopt a sociological, dynamic understanding of revolution that entails\nfocusing on the underlying processes that hold constant for both modern and\ncontemporary cases. In this way, revolutions can be seen as: the rapid, mass,\nforceful, systemic transformation of a society\u2019s principal institutions and organisa-\ntions.23 Revolutions are systemic in the sense that they are processes in which the\nmajor institutions and organisations in a society are transformed. Ways of doing\nbusiness and competing politically must change alongside shifts in values and\nattitudes if an example of radical change is truly to warrant the name revolution.\nRevolutions are not merely about the introduction of elections, the privatisation of\none or two industries or the opening up of media outlets to allow mild critiques of\nthe status quo \u2013 they are something much more fundamental and comprehensive.\nRevolutions seek to overturn a society\u2019s social, economic and political structures,\nand recast its international relations, all within a relatively short time-frame. This\ndifferentiates revolutions from evolutionary change that is comprehensive but takes\nplace over the long-term, reform programmes that take place in the short-term but\ndo not engender fundamental change, and transitions which see only a partial\nmodification of a society\u2019s main institutions and organisations, and take place over\na medium-term time-frame.24 In other words, revolutions can be differentiated\nfrom other processes of social change primarily by their scope, depth and effect.25\nRevolutions are processes rooted both in the longue dur\u00e9e, which provides the\nseeds for the revolutionary crisis to emerge, and are caused by short-term triggers\nwhich ignite the revolutionary process. In this sense, revolutions both \u2018happen\u2019\nand are \u2018made\u2019 \u2013 an \u2018organic crisis\u2019 joins with purposive action in the development\nof a revolutionary situation, in the playing out of revolutionary events and in\ndetermining a revolution\u2019s outcomes.26 One must be prepared to delve around the\n22 John Foran, \u2018Theories of Revolution Reconsidered: Towards a Fourth Generation\u2019? Sociological\nReview, 11:1 (1993). The idea of there being an evolution to the study of revolutions with each\ngeneration building usefully on the insights of the last, stems from an article by Lawrence Stone:\nLawrence Stone, \u2018Theories of Revolution\u2019, World Politics, 18:2 (1966). Also see Lawson, Negotiated\nRevolutions, ch. 2.\n23 Institutions and organisations are offered as a \u2018middle-level\u2019 analysis capable of unravelling and\nevaluating revolutionary transformations. For more on this, see Lawson, Negotiated Revolutions,\nch. 1.\n24 For more on this, see Alexander J. Motyl, Revolutions, Nations, Empires (New York: Columbia\nUniversity Press, 1999). A useful differentiation is made by James Rosenau, who distinguishes\nbetween \u2018personnel wars\u2019 that take place for control of the government, \u2018authority wars\u2019 that lead to\na change of regime, and structural wars or social revolutions, which encompass a much broader\ntransformation of power relations. James N. Rosenau, International Aspects of Civil Strife\n(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1964).\n25 For more on this, see Piotr Sztompka, The Sociology of Social Change (Oxford: Blackwell, 1993).\n26 The notion of \u2018organic crisis\u2019 is drawn from Gramsci. For Gramsci, revolutions take place in an era\nin which, \u2018the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of\nmorbid symptoms appear\u2019.

Although led by an elite, revolutions are mass events in\nwhich the population is prepared to defy the old regime and overturn the existing\norder. This distinguishes revolutions from processes of reform from above, palace\ncoup or putsch. Lenin and Castro may have seized power with only a handful of\nwell-armed, committed revolutionaries, but their regimes were supported and\nsustained by popular legitimacy, at least in the short- to medium-term (although in\nboth cases, the iron fist of dictatorship was never too far from the surface).\nRevolutionary regimes are propped up by consensus as well as by force. In contrast,\nthe so-called \u2018Bolivarian Revolution\u2019 initiated by Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, like\nthose conducted by other members of the officer corps throughout the developing\nworld, is better understood as a coup rather than a revolution precisely because it\nlacks sufficient popular support, is relatively limited in its aims and is hemmed in by\nembedded, structural forces. Similarly the shallowness, partiality and uncertain\nlong-term effects of Indonesia\u2019s so-called \u2018quiet revolution\u2019 and President George W.\nBush\u2019s \u2018revolution in foreign policy\u2019 indicates that they should be considered as\nsomething other than revolutions.27\nThe third similarity between negotiated revolutions and modern revolutions is\ntheir constitutive effect on world politics. Revolutions have always been international\nevents \u2013 revolutionaries follow the example of other transformations, the vision of\nrevolutionaries cares little for national boundaries and all revolutionaries seek to\nexport revolution abroad. Goals of world revolution may rarely, in practice, be either\nattempted or achieved, as strategic calculations about the availability of scarce\nresources and alternative ideologies like nationalism impede the spread of revolu-\ntions. But even as aspirations, revolutions play influential roles in the growth of\nprotest movements, rebellions, coups and reform overseas.28 The French Revolution,\nfor example, introduced into the public domain concepts like \u2018nationalism\u2019, \u2018left\u2019 and\n\u2018right\u2019, and what Eric Hobsbawm calls its \u2018most lasting and universal consequence\u2019 \u2013\nthe metric system.29 Although the initial direction of the revolutionary programme\nwas subverted by Robespierre\u2019s \u2018Terror\u2019 and Napoleonic dictatorship, its impact\ntravelled far and wide: counter-revolutionary alliances were formed to crush the\nrevolution; other uprisings were carried out in its name; reform programmes were\ninitiated to prevent revolutions taking place elsewhere. Revolutions, both as concept\nand practice, affect the very nature of the international system.\nNegotiated revolutions share this formative impact on world politics. By embracing\nthe norms, rules and operating procedures of advanced market democracies \u2013 the\nformation of liberal constitutions and free elections, the liberalisation of economic\nrelations, the establishment of a free press and so on \u2013 negotiated revolutions\nstrengthen the legitimacy of market democracy both as an aspirational project and as a\n27 For contrasting views, see Lex Rieffel, \u2018Indonesia\u2019s Quiet Revolution\u2019, Foreign Affairs, 83:5 (2004),\nand Ivo H.

Also, as exemplars of a novel form of revolutionary change, negotiated\nrevolutions stand as paradigmatic models of radical change, as \u2018great revolutions\u2019 with\npotentially deep lessons for those states sharing similar problems or going through\ncomparable processes. One only has to look at the level of attention paid to South\nAfrica\u2019s transformation to see its appeal as a model of radical change.30 However,\ncrucially, negotiated revolutions also challenge some of the very foundations of\ncontemporary world politics. Negotiated revolutions aptly demonstrate the follies of a\nfundamentalist belief in the good of the market (rising inequality and unemployment)\nand the dangers which come from failing to support nascent social and political\ninstitutions (an increase in extremism, corruption, a legitimacy gap between elites and\ncivil society). This point is well illustrated by the example of the Czech Republic.\nIn the Czech Republic, the opening up of the economy through privatisation and\nliberalisation programmes has produced uneven results: an initial drop in GDP\nfollowed by a sudden period of growth before a second tailing off and the return of\nmore steady, if slower, growth. This series of lurches has led to a rise in unemploy-\nment as the state and the business sector have struggled to come to terms with the\ndemands of a relatively unrestricted market economy.31 Perhaps as a result, there has\nbeen a concomitant increase in corruption. Indeed, a welter of corruption scandals\nhas plagued the Czech government since 1989. A prime example is the case of\nJaroslav Lizner, a businessman who not only ran the main privatisation scheme\nconducted by the state during the early- mid-1990s but also headed a leading private\ninvestment fund at the same time. Lizner was found with Kr 8.3 m (over\nUS$ 300,000) cash in a briefcase for use as a bribe to enable his company to buy a\nstake in a leading dairy enterprise. Lizner did not deny the charges, instead pointing\nout that such a deal was normal practice, a facilitation fee for services rendered. In\n2002, a senior official in the Foreign Ministry, Karel Srba, was found with over\n$750,000 cash in his apartment, gains from a shady property deal. According to the\nWorld Bank, a quarter of Czech firms frequently pay \u2018irregular unofficial payments\nto get things done\u2019.32 In 2003, an EU accession team reported that corruption was \u2018a\nserious cause for concern\u2019.33\nFurthermore, one of the unintended consequences of the move to market-\ndemocracy in the Czech Republic has been the destruction of old, informal networks\nof support. Where once an extended family provided childcare or a neighbour\nsupplied cheap goods, an individualistic culture has emerged in which social relations\nhave been formalised and routinised. As the transition has become more painful, so\nlevels of social capital have declined. Trust in the new Czech Republic has fallen\nmarkedly: in January 1991, 71 per cent of Czechs said they trusted parliament but by\n2003, this support had dropped to 29 per cent; Czechs have the lowest trust in the\nregion in the military and the judicial system.34\n30 Similarly, one only has to look at the failings of the \u2018transitions from above\u2019 in Afghanistan and\nIraq to draw parallel cautionary lessons.\n31 For example, in the Czech Republic, unemployment rose from a statistically redundant 0.8 per cent\nof the working population in 1990 to over 10 per cent in 2003.\n32 World Bank, Czech Republic: Completing the Transformation of Banks and Enterprises (Washington,\nDC: World Bank, 2002). It is worth noting that the comparable figures for Poland and Hungary are\n33 per cent and 31 per cent respectively. However, in Slovenia the figure is as low as 8 per cent.\n33 Europa Publications, Central and South Eastern Europe (London: Europa, 2003).\n34 Figures taken from Economist Intelligence Unit, The Czech Republic: Country Profile (London:\nEIU, 2004).\nNegotiated revolutions 481\nThe collapse of communism has provided fertile ground for the growth of racism\nin the Czech Republic. The removal of old certainties afforded by the restrictive shell\nof communism has allowed previously submerged and latent prejudices to bubble to\nthe surface. Fuelled by worsening economic conditions during the mid- to late-1990s,\nthe strong electoral performance of the neo-fascist Republican Party and the rise of\npublications like Politika, a focal point for anti-semitic writing, racism has emerged\nas a pervasive problem in the post-communist era. During the 1990s, there were over\n1,500 violent attacks reported by skinheads against Roma, resulting in 30 deaths. The\nSecretary of the Republican Party, Jan Vik, makes no apology for such actions,\n\u2018Roma murder, rape and rob decent people. It is high time to resolutely stop the\nraving of these black racists who are acting as parasites to the detriment of the whole\nsociety.\u201935 In 1998, the mayor of Usti\u2019Nad Labem announced plans to build a wall\naround a Roma housing complex on the grounds that it was necessary \u2018to separate\nthe decent people from those who are not\u2019.36 In 1999, the leader of the Republican\nParty, Miroslav Sladek offered a car to the Czech mayor most successful at expelling\nRoma from their town. Half of all Czechs favour the expulsion of Roma from the\nCzech Republic and another third want Roma to be isolated or concentrated in\nparticular areas; 87 per cent say they would mind Roma living in their neighbour-\nhoods.37 Such views are given further credence by official policy. The Citizenship Law\nof 1993 deemed 100,000 Roma to be stateless through retroactive residency require-\nments and demands that Czech citizens have clean criminal records. In the mid-1990s,\n62 per cent of the police force said that they thought racially motivated crimes were\nprovoked by Roma themselves. Those crimes that are investigated rarely end in\nprosecutions.\nAs Erin Jenne writes, the result of this official and privately held prejudice has been\nthe construction of a Roma \u2018ethnoclass\u2019.38 Roma are heavily discriminated against in\nthe workplace and over-represented in a range of negative social categories, from\nunemployment rates to residency of mental asylums. Recent government figures\nfound that Roma unemployment was anywhere between 70 and 90 per cent, and that\nnearly three-quarters of Roma children were being educated in schools for the\nmentally handicapped. The infant mortality rate for Roma is twice that of the\nnational average while Roma life expectancy as a whole is ten years below that for\nwhite Czechs.39 It was therefore little surprise that in 1997, many Roma seized the\nchance to emigrate en masse to Canada following the lifting of visa restrictions. Over\n1,000 were admitted in the six months before requirements were reintroduced; 800\nmore were allowed to enter the UK in 1998 on the basis of racial discrimination.\nIn these three ways, therefore, negotiated revolutions like that in the Czech\nRepublic are comparable to the \u2018great revolutions\u2019 of the modern era \u2013 the changes\nthey provoke are fundamental, if not always desirable. But, importantly, negotiated\nrevolutions move away from the prevalent patterns associated with modern revolu-\ntions in five main ways. From a suspicion of revolution which frequently led to\n35 Rick Fawn, \u2018Czech Attitudes to the Roma\u2019, Europe-Asia Studies, 53:8 (2001).\n36 John Nagle and Alison Mahr, Democracy and Democratisation (London: Sage, 1999), p. 159.\n37 For more on these polls, see Robin Shepherd, Czechoslovakia: The Velvet Revolution and Beyond\n(Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2000).\n38 Erin Jenne, \u2018The Roma of Eastern and Central Europe: Constructing a Stateless Nation\u2019, in\nJonathan R.

Sharpe, 2000).\n39 Economist Intelligence Unit, Czech Republic: Country Profile.\n482 George Lawson\ncounter-revolution, the international, both in terms of structure and agency, actively\nwelcomes the insurgent states. The utopian vision that often resulted in extremism is\nexchanged for a revolutionary ideology rooted in longer-term principles of freedom,\na return to normalcy and a desire to \u2018catch up\u2019 with other states. A violent conflict\nbetween rival forces is replaced by the acceptance of mutual dependency, the\nundesirability of ongoing civil conflict and a greater role for structural, latent forms\nof violence. From a fight to the finish comes a process in which the old regime and\nrevolutionaries together negotiate the destruction of the old order and the birth of a\nnew nation. Rather than the creation of a stronger, more bureaucratic state, a\nrelatively weak state emerges both in terms of despotic authority and infrastructural\ncapacity, hemmed in by independent actors, both national and international. As\nsuch, negotiated revolutions are tangible signs of an imminent modularity in world\npolitics in which radical change is based around the idea of liberation rather than the\ndream of utopia.\nFrom Burke to Paine\nRevolutions are intricately bound up with the international. First, they are, to an\nextent, reliant on international context. During the Cold War, for example, a\nrelatively impermeable operating environment tended to foreclose opportunities for\nrevolutionary change. Any disruption to the status quo was considered, usually by\nboth blocs, as a hazardous disruption to the global constellation of forces. In this\nway, the United States favoured authoritarian strongmen, most noticeably in the\nAmericas, even at the cost of democratically elected heads of state. For their part, the\nSoviet Union rarely intervened openly to help even apparent allies in the developing\nworld, at least at nothing like the level of assistance offered by, for example, Fidel\nCastro in Cuba.40 Over the past two centuries, international statesmen and diplomats\nwhatever their overt political stripes have tended to view revolutions with Burkean\nsuspicion, often backed up by active support for counter-revolutionary measures.41\nOrder, time and again, has trumped demands for justice.\nHowever, the end of the Cold War led to an opening up of this closed international\norder and removed many of the negative connotations associated with revolutionary\nchange. The apparent \u2018triumph\u2019 of market democracy and the collapse of a viable\nalternative system acted as a spur for radical change around the world. As long as\nrevolutionaries framed their story as one of a return to normalcy (Chile), emancipa-\ntion from the Soviet yoke (the Czech Republic) or as liberation from a system whose\ntime had long since past (South Africa), as long as they agreed to abide by a series\n40 There is increasing evidence, however, that the Soviet Union supported revolutions in the\ndeveloping world covertly. At a seminar held at the London School of Economics in November\n2003, Vladimir Shubin, a Russian expert on Southern Africa, claimed that the Soviet Union was\ninvolved in nineteen conflicts in the Third World during the Cold War.\n41 The importance of counter-revolution lies in what Philip Windsor calls \u2018the vulnerability of the\ngreat powers\u2019. In order to maintain their position, status and credibility, great powers are forced to\nquell moments of disorder, intervening in order to demonstrate their steadfastness against threats to\ntheir hegemony. This \u2018system-pressure\u2019 is, as Windsor points out, a kind of \u2018weakness-in-strength\u2019.\nFor a fuller discussion of this, see Nick Bisley, \u2018Counter-Revolution, Order and International\nPolitics\u2019, Review of International Studies, 30:1 (2004).\nNegotiated revolutions 483\nof neo-liberal reforms and signed up to a welter of international institutions and\nnormative frameworks, so the great powers welcomed what had previously been\noutcast states into the community of nations. Burkean suspicion was supplanted by\nan almost Paine-like enthusiasm. Just cause was given a rare opportunity for\nrealisation.\nInternational assistance for negotiated revolutions varied from the normative (the\nrecognition of the legitimacy of the revolutionary struggle) to the material (aid\npackages, election monitors and so on). The revolutionary transformations in the\nCzech Republic and South Africa succeeded because of the structural opening\nafforded by the end of the Cold War and the active support of international\nagencies \u2013 state departments, key individuals and global institutions alike. In Chile,\nthe international played a major role in the transition, witnessed for example by the\nexample effect of democratisation in neighbouring states, the US government\u2019s\npartial funding for the \u2018No\u2019 campaign against the dictatorship and the pressure\napplied by Washington on the junta to accept the result of the 1988 plebiscite on\nwhether the military regime should stand down.\nOne of the striking elements of negotiated revolutions is the transformation which\nthey induce in foreign policymaking. Rather than building up armies in order to\nshore up their regimes from internal and external enemies, both the Czech Republic\nand South Africa have sought to join and strengthen international institutions,\nregimes and organisations. In the Czech Republic, post-revolutionary foreign policy\nhas turned firmly to the West. In June 1991, the Czech Republic joined the Council\nof Europe, an organisation whose members had to be committed to free elections and\nthe rule of law. In October 1993, an Association Agreement with the EU was signed,\nmarking the onset of negotiations leading towards eventual membership of the\nUnion. In October 1995, the Czech Republic became an official Associate Member of\nthe EU and in 1996, an application for full membership was lodged. The Czech public\nvoted overwhelmingly in favour of joining the union in a referendum held in June\n2003 and accession procedures were completed in May 2004.42 Likewise, after joining\nNATO in March 1999, the government committed Czech troops to specialist work\nand peacekeeping roles in hotspots around the world. In February 2004, 100 Czech\nspecial forces launched the first combat mission conducted by Czech forces since\nWorld War II in Afghanistan.\nBetween 1948 and 1994, apartheid South Africa practised what Peter Schraeder\ndescribes as \u2018the diplomacy of isolation\u2019.43 Since 1994, South African foreign policy\nhas been undergoing a process of transformation. After an unpromising start in\nwhich a coterie of diplomats, exemplified by Director-General Rusty Evans,\nattempted to forestall substantial policy and personnel changes, an extended range of\nactors including the Department of Trade and Industry, the Portfolio Committee on\nForeign Affairs and the Parliamentary Select Committee on Defence has begun to\n42 Just over 80 per cent of Czechs voted in favour of membership in the June 2003 referendum.\n43 Peter Schraeder, Exporting Democracy: Rhetoric vs. Reality (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner, 2002).\nSome diplomatic efforts were made, particularly by Pik Botha, Foreign Minister between 1980 and\n1994, to establish apartheid South Africa\u2019s legitimate credentials. But in Africa, only Malawi and\nthe C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire recognised the apartheid state. Elsewhere, South Africa maintained cordial\nrelations with Israel, particularly after 1973, as it did with Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi\u2019s Iran.\nSome states, among them the United States, Britain and West Germany, established a working\nrelationship with Pretoria, but by and large, the apartheid regime was an outcast, excluded from\nmultilateral bodies and ostracised by most of the international community.\n484 George Lawson\ncontribute in a meaningful sense to the foreign policymaking process. The scope of\nSouth Africa\u2019s external missions has increased: forty-three new embassies have been\ncreated since 1994, over half of them now staffed by black South Africans.\n\u2018Second-track\u2019 diplomacy has seen South African think-tanks and policy institutes\nlike the Foundation for Global Dialogue, the African Centre for the Constructive\nResolution of Disputes and the Centre for Conflict Resolution play a role in\ndemocratisation in Nigeria, Congo, Sudan and Burundi. Overall, foreign policy has\nbecome associated with a broad interventionism that has seen the new look SANDF\ntake part in a number of engagements abroad. In 1999, the government became\nactively involved in conflict resolution in Burundi and in 2002, South African troops\nwere sent to Congo to safeguard its fragile peace settlement. South Africa has also\nplayed an energetic role in conflicts in the Comoros Islands, Rwanda, Madagascar,\nthe Ivory Coast and Sudan. Between 1994 and 2000, South Africa signed seventy\nmultilateral treaties, joined the WTO and rejoined both the OAU and the Common-\nwealth. The same period saw South Africa host a welter of international conferences,\nincluding the annual meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the UN World\nConference on Racism and the World Summit on Sustainable Development. All this\nis crowned by President Mbeki\u2019s call for an African Renaissance, which has seen\nSouth Africa actively promote democracy and human rights around the continent\nand take the lead in international organisations like the African Union. In Greg Mills\nwords, South Africa has gone from being \u2018a pariah to a participant\u2019.44 Once the\nworld\u2019s \u2018polecat\u2019, South Africa now plays an active part in a number of international\nagencies, standing as a pivot between north and south and as a standard bearer for\ndeveloping nations.45\nFrom utopia to normalcy\nScholars often lament the lack of a utopian vision or grand plan in the revolutions of\n1989 and after. In these cases, it is argued, revolutionaries had no world vision to\nmatch the dreams of equality and liberty espoused in France and Russia. But, as\nnoted above, demanding that every revolution conjures a new world vision as an\nessential criteria for its definition would disqualify almost every case from being\nlabelled as a revolution. All revolutionaries have looked to the past as much as the\npresent, let alone to a vision of a future utopia, to legitimise their revolt. Revolutions\nare at once both ruptures and restorations, Janus-faced processes which as Bar-\nrington Moore puts it, \u2018march into the future facing resolutely backwards\u2019.46 In this\nsense, there is no contradiction in labelling the events of 1989 and after as \u2018rectifying\nrevolutions\u2019 or indeed, as negotiated revolutions.47 Revolutionaries in 1989 followed\ntheir predecessors by looking backwards as well as forwards, to 1688 and 1848 as well\n44 Greg Mills (ed.), From Pariah to Participant (Johannesburg: South African Institute of International\nAffairs, 1994).\n45 This shift should not be seen as an even nor as an unproblematic process. For a fuller analysis of\nSouth Africa\u2019s post-apartheid foreign policy, see Chris Alden and Garth Le Pere, South Africa\u2019s\nPost-Apartheid Foreign Policy: From Reconciliation to Revival? (London: International Institute for\nStrategic Studies, 2003).\n46 In Kumar, Revolutionary Ideas and Ideals, p. 166.\n47 The term \u2018rectifying revolutions\u2019 was coined by J\u00fcrgen Habermas.\nNegotiated revolutions 485\nas to 1789 and 1917. Furthermore, there was something novel about the role of ideas\nin 1989 \u2013 the deliberate lack of a utopian vision; what V\u00e1clav Havel calls \u2018anti-\nideology\u2019 and Gy\u00f6rgy Konr\u00e1d \u2018antipolitics\u2019. Central and Eastern Europeans wanted\nto return to Europe, to catch up with the West, to become what they perceived as\nnormal again. Precisely what they did not want was the autocracy that flows from\nfidelity to a grand vision or theory.\nBy eschewing the obedience to a particular ideology which served to legitimise\nmany of the excesses carried out in the name of revolutions in the past, negotiated\nrevolutions avoid the patterns of domestic and international terror, counter-\nrevolution, autarchy and war that have characterised many previous revolutions.\nNegotiated revolutions seek to build a new order without the despotic coercive\ncontrol exerted by their predecessors but one that boasts a commitment to\ndemocratic political relations defined by a written, liberal constitution; regular, free\nelections competed over by a range of political parties; the separation of the state\nfrom the security apparatus and the military; and an internationalist perspective\nwhich demands an active role in relevant international institutions and organisations.\nEconomically, negotiated revolutions undergo programmes of liberalisation and\nprivatisation which open up the domestic market to foreign competition, establish an\nindependent financial sector and maintain trade policies in keeping with prevailing\ninternational regimes. Socially, negotiated revolutions foster a relatively open\nenvironment featuring a free media and education system; enshrine equality of race,\ngender and religion in law; and develop a means by which to reconcile past injustices,\nusually by way of a truth commission.\nTruth commissions are perhaps the best means of assessing the novel role of\nideology in negotiated revolutions. All revolutions require some mechanism for\ndealing with the injustices of the old order, a means of moving from old to new which\nestablishes the authority and legitimacy of the incoming regime while also providing\nan outlet for people\u2019s sense of outrage and thirst for revenge. In the past, these needs\nwere satiated through a mixture of firing squads, guillotines, show trials, gulags and\npurges. Negotiated revolutions, founded on principles of restorative rather than\npunitive or retributive justice, institute truth commissions as an innovative way of\ndealing with these issues.48 The character and outcomes of truth commissions closely\nreflect the nature of both the polity and the particular society within which they take\nplace: secretive and repressed in Chile, kept firmly behind closed doors by an old\nguard determined to cling on to power; messy and violent in South Africa, a\nperambulating Pandora\u2019s box held in the full gaze of a disorientated public; uncertain\nand limited in the Czech Republic, where the main body of evidence was police files\nheld over from the communist era. There is therefore no single route map for societies\nescaping from, or seeking to escape from, entrenched conflict. In South Africa, a\ntruth commission has been a valuable symbolic tool representing the birth of a\nnew nation; in Chile, it was only the arrest of the former dictator in 1998 which\nmoved the transition on apace; in the Czech Republic, a flawed law \u2013 lustrace \u2013 has\n48 This is not to say that truth commissions originate with negotiated revolutions. In fact, they first\nappeared during the 1980s in Latin America as a means of hearing from, and compensating,\nfamilies of those who had \u2018disappeared\u2019 under military dictatorships. As they have developed, truth\ncommissions have become far more complex, reaching their apogee, at least to date, in South\nAfrica.\n486 George Lawson\nfailed to provide a sense of resolution between an autocratic past and a democratic\nfuture.49\nWhat these processes share is a commitment to the generation of a foundational\nnarrative for a new nation out of which a collective rather than a disjointed history\ncan emerge. As such, they fulfil the age-old need to provide an outlet for the victims\nof the old regime, a moment when innocent people get the chance to tell stories which\nwould otherwise go unheard, a weapon of the weak turned back against seemingly\nalmighty oppressors. But at the same time, they perform this task in a novel\nfashion \u2013 by trading truth for punishment. For all their flaws, TRCs represent central\nelements in the ideological differentiation of negotiated revolutions from past\nexamples of revolutionary change. They are one element of the attempt to reconcile\nwhat were apparently intractable differences. As such, TRCs are a crucial step in the\nargument which states that real conflicts and social cleavages cannot, nor should they\nbe, emasculated behind a fa\u00e7ade of consensus but that conflict by civil war, firing\nsquad or show trial is disastrous for a nation\u2019s future wellbeing. For that reason and\nthat reason alone, they represent the distinctiveness of negotiated revolutions from\nthe modern revolutions of the past two centuries or so.\nFrom festivals of violence to festivals of hope\nIn the modern era, revolutions have been seen as festivals of violence, fights to the\nfinish in which one side vanquishes the other, an ultimate victory in which a new\norder is instituted while the ashes of the old are still burning. Of course, history tells\na somewhat different story: the 1789 Revolution ushered in a decade of domestic\nstrife in France, opening up the way to dictatorship and war; the Bolshevik\nRevolution was followed by a four-year civil war in which foreign armies and their\nproxies fought fiercely with the Red Army; the two-stage Chinese Revolution was\nseparated by a battle for domestic hegemony which lasted for three decades. Even\nafter these revolutions, the new regimes struggled to impose their authority on their\nwider societies, hence Robespierre\u2019s Terror, Stalin\u2019s forced collectivisation and\n49 Lustrace was flawed in numerous ways. First, the investigation commission set up by the law relied\non secret police documentation which many argued was incomplete, could have been doctored to\nappease bosses or implicate enemies, and failed to differentiate between formal informers and those\nwho unwittingly helped the security services. Second, the law did not exempt anyone on the grounds\nof mitigating circumstances, even torture, threat or blackmail. Third, lustrace presupposed guilt,\nrequiring the accused to prove their innocence rather than accusers to establish culpability. This\nallowed lustrace to become both a powerful political tool and a moral condemnation of people who\nwere, at least initially, unable to defend themselves. Names of people under investigation were\nregularly leaked to the press, only later for them to be found innocent. In the most famous, or\nperhaps infamous case, Jan Kavan, a dissident who had spent much of the communist period in\nexile abroad claimed that he had no knowledge that he had been targeted by the secret police, had\nbeen denied access to crucial files and prevented from presenting witnesses. Kavan won his appeal\nand later became Foreign Minister, but not before comparing lustrace to McCarthyism, declaring\n\u2018we are at the top of the league at witch-hunts\u2019. For more on this, see Nagle and Mahr, Democracy\nand Democratisation; Kieran Williams and Dennis Deletant, Security Intelligence Services in New\nDemocracies: The Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania (Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2000); and\nKieran Williams, \u2018Lustration as the Securitization of Democracy in Czechoslovakia and the Czech\nRepublic\u2019, Journal of Communist Societies and Transition Politics, 19:4 (2003).\nNegotiated revolutions 487\npurges, and Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution, all attempts to shore up revolutionary\nregimes from opposition at home and abroad, real and imagined.50\nNegotiated revolutions offer a radically different conceptualisation of violence\nthan past examples of revolution. Negotiated transformations are not violent fights\nto the finish but relatively peaceful processes in which deals are struck between\nrevolutionaries and their adversaries. First, overt violence is contained \u2013 both sides\nseek a settlement of previously irreconcilable differences without recourse to coercive\npower, although, of course, these conflicts featured varying degrees of overt violence\nleading up to the revolutionary d\u00e9nouement itself. Second, violence tends to appear\nin latent, structural form rather than as an explicit policy tool. Structural violence\nemits an unfortunate residue for the incoming regime; the social legacy imparted by\nauthoritarian rule on the new order remains a difficult and pressing issue for Czech,\nSouth African and Chilean leaders. Yet this is a long way removed from the\ndivisiveness and rupture experienced by past revolutionary states. Third, the\noutcome of the revolutionary struggle is not the battle between revolutionary and\ncounter-revolutionary forces common to previous revolutions. This is because the\nproselytising vision offered by these states is one rooted in the underlying principles,\nnorms and practices of the international system itself: support for multilateralism and\ninternational organisations; a liberal view of progress; and a concern for welfare and\ndevelopment. In this way, negotiated revolutions avoid the extreme levels of violence,\nboth domestic and international, which have plagued so many revolutions in the\nmodern era.\nThis point is exemplified through the example of South Africa. As Pierre du Toit\nwrites, under apartheid, South Africa was the most repressive society in the world:\nthree-and-a-half million people were forcibly uprooted from their homes; an\ninsidious and pervasive ideology of racial superiority denied the rights of nearly\nnine-tenths of the population to basic needs, schooling and work; significant groups\nin South African society ranging from the church to the medical profession were\ncomplicit in the oppression of their fellow citizens by turning a blind eye or actively\nsanctioning police brutality and abuse; discrimination and humiliation were used as\neveryday instruments of psychological torture to erode the dignity, self-belief and\nsecurity of non-white South Africans.51 The result was a society of violent crime,\nrape, drug abuse, alcoholism and family breakdown.\nYet despite these levels of structural violence, South Africa did not experience an\novertly violent overthrow of apartheid. There was no sudden seizure of power in\nSouth Africa, no date when the revolutionary army swept through the streets of\nPretoria. For many participants and observers alike, this lack of a revolutionary\nmoment and the watering down of opposition demands and goals amounted to a\nbetrayal of the revolution itself. But such a viewpoint is based on a fallacy, that the\nalternative to negotiation was the outright victory of the liberation movement.\nRevolutionaries lacked the capacity to win a military victory over the old regime, just\nas the old regime could no longer carry on ruling in the same way. It was mutual\ndependence and mutual weakness which bought combatants to the negotiating table.\nNegotiation offered a route out of impasse, an end to the tyranny of an authoritarian\n50 The proclivity of revolutionary regimes to domestic tyranny is evidenced today by Fidel Castro\u2019s\nregular crackdowns on domestic dissent in Cuba.\n51 For more on this, see Pierre Du Toit, South Africa\u2019s Brittle Peace: The Problem of Post-Settlement\nViolence (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001).\n488 George Lawson\nsystem and containment of the excesses of oppressors and freedom fighters alike. But,\nby its very nature, the deal struck between adversaries was less than perfect, involving\nconcessions from both sides of the barricades. This does not diminish the country\u2019s\ntransformation since 1994. Rather, the containment of violent struggle has generated\nan outcome perhaps less dramatic than past examples of revolutionary change, but\nalso less damaging to the long-term fabric of the country itself.\nThe crucial point is that, if a negotiated revolution is to succeed, both sides must\nrenounce violence as a legitimate policy tool. As the old regime tends to retain control\nof the coercive apparatus longer than any other means of authority, this decision\nis primarily the preserve of the old guard. Hence the concern over the night of\n5th October 1988 that the Chilean junta might not accept the result of the plebiscite\nwhich ended its rule, the relief among leaders of the 1989 general strike in the Czech\nRepublic that the army was not called in to restore order, and the uncertainty among\nleading ANC cadres over whether the armed forces would play a neutral role during\nthe negotiating process and the 1994 elections. In each case, the role of the coercive\napparatus was critical but uncertain. In each case, elites chose not to use the force\navailable to them.\nThe lack of a recourse to armed conflict by old regime elites in Chile, South Africa\nand the Czech Republic contrasts starkly with the decision by the Chinese politburo\nto employ the army against student protesters in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, a\npolicy which helped to successfully defuse large scale opposition to the regime over\nthe subsequent decade. It is now common knowledge that in East Germany, Erich\nHonecker came close to deploying the armed forces against protesters, until he was\npersuaded otherwise by Mikhail Gorbachev among others. In Romania, Nicolae\nCeausescu\u2019s elite force, the Securitate, failed to defend the leadership against a\ndetermined uprising. Neither China nor Romania experienced negotiated revolu-\ntions, yet East Germany did. In each case, it was a conjunction of elite action,\ndomestic opposition and external forces, both structural and agential, which\ndetermined the immediate path of the insurrection. These examples provoke two\nmain lessons. First, violence and revolution are tied together contingently rather than\nby necessity. Second, revolutions do not follow settled, inexorable paths. They are\ncritical junctures which may lead in any one of a number of directions. At all times,\nrevolutions are a complex interplay between changing structural conditions and\ncollective action. One element which differentiates negotiated revolutions from past\nrevolutions is that, once the revolutionary situation is in place, actors from both sides\nof the barricades choose roundtables rather than guillotines.\nFrom guillotines to roundtables\nThe great revolutions of the modern era are all marked by a particular event, an icon\nwhich comes to embody the very essence of the revolutionary struggle itself. The\nstorming of the Bastille, the raid on the Winter Palace and the Long March\nundertaken by the remnants of Mao\u2019s army are all revolutionary mementos par\nexcellence, symbols of the might of the revolutionary struggle and the relative\nweakness of the old regime. Negotiated revolutions do not lack for these great\nmoments. The daily demonstrations in Wenceslas Square and the release of Nelson\nNegotiated revolutions 489\nMandela aptly indicate the emotive appeal of these transformations. Yet while the\ncentral motif of past revolutions has been explicitly associated with armed rebellion,\nnegotiated revolutions take on a somewhat different character \u2013 the power of the\nmasses to be sure, but not that of the mob. Rather, the control of fervour and the\ndignity of protest rise above the social context defined by the old regime. Central to\nthis success is the process of negotiation between old and new elites.\nAs stated above, revolutions must be relatively quick in order to differentiate them\nfrom processes of transition and longer-term evolutionary change. This does not rule\nout some degree of variation \u2013 the whirlwind of talks held in three short weeks in the\nCzech Republic seems light years away from the tortuous three years of stop-start\nnegotiations in South Africa. But what unites these cases with past revolutions is that\nthe outcomes were neither inevitable nor miraculous, neither the necessary conse-\nquence of particular structural alignments nor the intended, rational consequence of\npeople\u2019s individual\u2019s actions. Negotiated revolutions are marked by uncertainty and\nflux, moments when the outcomes were unclear and the path to peaceful resolution\nunlikely. As such, these processes serve as powerful examples of the dynamic\ninterplay between structure and agency, necessity and contingency, cause and\noutcome.\nAgain, a counterfactual helps to clarify this point. In the early 1990s, Burma\n(Myanmar) appeared to contain all the necessary ingredients for a negotiated\ntransformation. The end of the Cold War removed the last vestiges of international\nsupport for the military junta. The regime ruled over an inherently unstable, corrupt,\ndevalued political order; the economy was in a parlous state; and the atomised social\norder shut off the elite in Rangoon from the views of the general public. Opposition\ncoalesced around a popular leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who represented a viable\nalternative, boasted considerable domestic and international legitimacy, and pos-\nsessed the necessary resources with which to challenge the authority of the military\nregime. Although some reforms were initiated, including the onset of roundtable\ntalks, the opposition failed to oust or even significantly dent the authority of the\nmilitary regime. In a way reminiscent of how the military junta in Chile successfully\nsaw off opposition protests in the early 1980s, Burma\u2019s generals kept a firm grip on\npower. Despite displaying the right credentials, neither a transition nor transforma-\ntion has taken place in Myanmar over the last decade. This failure serves as a warning\nto those who ignore the intricacies of revolutionary processes and who postulate from\nthe lofty heights afforded by hindsight on the inevitability of historical processes\nwhich, on close inspection, reveal a logic quite removed from their suppositions.\nRevolutions, negotiated or otherwise, are an intricate conjunction of historical\ncontext, social conditions and political action.\nFrom tyranny to weakness\nIn the past, the causes, events and outcomes of revolutions were closely bound up\nwith the state. First, the revolutionary situation emerged out of a crisis rooted in the\nstate. Defeat in war, economic collapse and the like served to fatally destabilise the\nold regime. Second, revolutionary events were largely ordered around a fight for\ncontrol of the state. Third, the revolution was considered to be over in the short term\n490 George Lawson\nwhen one side seized control of key state apparatus. Finally, in the long term, in order\nto shore up their regime from opposition both at home and abroad, revolutionaries\nbuilt vast state bureaucracies and armies, exerting domestic authority through\nrigorous mechanisms of surveillance and control. As a result, post-revolutionary\nstates possessed a double strength. In Michael Mann\u2019s terms, they enjoyed both a\nconsiderable infrastructural capacity and a despotic potency, strengths which more\noften than not spilled over into tyranny.52\nThis pattern is not repeated by negotiated revolutions. Like past revolutions,\nnegotiated revolutions stem from systemic crisis in which the declining legitimacy of\nthe old regime is of cardinal importance. But at no point does the old regime collapse.\nThere is no process to mirror the French defeat in the Seven Years War, the Russian\ntrauma over defeat by Japan in 1905 and the First World War, or the Japanese\ninvasion of Manchuria for the Chinese. These events fatally undermined the old\nregime, providing staging posts in the slide towards a revolutionary situation. But in\nnegotiated revolutions, both the old regime and belligerents approached the negoti-\nating table from positions of mutual dependence. Neither side in the Czech Republic\nor South Africa, nor for that matter in Chile, had any hope of outright victory. It was\nthe weakness of both sides which compelled them to negotiation.53 The process of the\nrevolutions themselves is also distinct from the fight over the state common to past\nrevolutions. Negotiators deal with a set of issues far removed from those which\nconcerned previous revolutionaries: the make up of transitional bodies, the electoral\nprocess, the role of a constitutional convention and so on. Similarly, the outcomes of\nnegotiated revolutions fall some way short of the tyranny which marred revolution-\nary states in the past. Because negotiated revolutionaries seek to \u2018catch up\u2019 with\ndemocratic states, they sign up to a raft of international treaties, institutions and\nordinances which restrict their freedom of manoeuvre, particularly over fiscal policy.\nThe negotiations themselves circumscribe the potential for radical change, witnessed\nfor example by the sunset clauses and power-sharing agreements which formed a\ncentral part of the negotiations in South Africa. Because they face neither substantial\ndomestic nor external opposition, revolutionaries have no need to build up mass\narmies or extend coercive control around the country. In fact, in all three cases,\nincoming governments sought to contain rather than expand the authority of the\narmed forces and security apparatus. Such revolutionaries have no desire to export\ntheir revolution abroad by force. Equally, no counter-revolutionary force is\nunleashed to contain or overthrow the new regimes. Negotiated revolutions offer no\nproselytising vision but that offered by the dominant constituents of world politics\nthemselves. As such, they serve to strengthen the liberal international order.\nWhither revolution?\nIn the contemporary world, while citizens of what Robert Cooper calls the\n\u2018post-modern world\u2019 enjoy what seems to be a perpetual peace, around a billion\n52 For more on this, see Michael Mann, \u2018The Autonomous Power of the State: Its Origins,\nMechanisms and Results\u2019, European Journal of Sociology, 25:2 (1984).\n53 In this sense, there was a seemingly permanent state of what Charles Tilly (pace Leon Trotsky) calls\n\u2018dual sovereignty\u2019. Charles Tilly, From Mobilization to Revolution (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1978).\nNegotiated revolutions 491\npeople, or one in six of the world\u2019s population, live in countries mired in civil war or\nat high risk from falling into such conflict.54 Neither of these worlds is without its\nproblems. In advanced market democracies, uncertainty, social dislocation and the\ndifficulties associated with managing freedom \u2013 what the novelist Monica Ali calls\nthe \u2018limits of autonomy\u2019 \u2013 all present their concerns for policymakers.55 In Cooper\u2019s\n\u2018pre-modern\u2019 world, poverty, disease and increasing inequalities generate friction\nwhich all too often spills over into open conflict.56 At its heart, therefore, modernity\nappears to be an inherently contradictory process, one marked by greater affluence\nbut also rising inequality; secularisation but also fundamentalism; global forms of\ngovernance alongside a drive to local autonomy.57 As numerous scholars, among\nthem Stuart Hall and Anthony Giddens, point out, modernity has fashioned a world\nwithout certainties, one in which people must get by without either the absolute\nvalues or the social institutions that sustained order in the past. Given the incongruity\nand uncertainty that characterises modernity, a continuation of the constitutive role\nplayed by processes of radical change seems assured.\nThe part to be played by negotiated revolutions in this story is one born out of\nboth hope and challenge. In the first instance, negotiated revolutions demonstrate the\npossibility of states \u2018catching up\u2019 with the West in a way which would have been\nrecognisable to Trotsky almost a century ago. On the other hand, negotiated\nrevolutions contest some of the core features of world politics, not least the role\nplayed by unfettered markets. As Karl Polanyi pointed out over half a century ago,\na market economy cannot succeed without a \u2018market society\u2019 \u2013 all economic acts are\nnecessarily embedded in social structures.58 All too often, states undergoing negoti-\nated revolutions have seen a commitment by international actors to establishing free\nmarkets fail to be matched by a nurturing of the social and political institutions\nwhich are germane to the functioning of a consolidated market democracy. Heeding\nPolanyi\u2019s lesson as to the necessity of nurturing a \u2018market society\u2019 alongside a\n\u2018market economy\u2019 is critical if international agencies are to deal more effectively with\nsocieties facing similar pressures and going through comparable processes in years to\ncome.\nAbove all else, it is clear that the management system of contemporary world\npolitics, whether that be the bequest of an imperial power or hegemon, a coalition of\ngreat powers or multilateral centres of governance, needs to take ongoing pressures\nfor radical change seriously. The example of South Africa, one of the most\nremarkable testimonies to the politics of the possible of this age, or any other,\nreminds us of what can be achieved through human agency. Even in the most\ninhospitable of domestic environments, belligerents convened a common future\nbased on mutual respect for what appeared to be inalienable differences. Not\neverything in South Africa has changed \u2013 nor has it done so in previous revolutions.\nBut in South Africa, a radically new order has been instituted which bears little\n54 Figures taken from Paul Collier, \u2018How to Stem Civil Wars: It\u2019s the Economy, Stupid\u2019, International\nHerald Tribune, 21 May 2003, p. 13.\n55 For more on this, see Geoff Mulgan, Connexity: How to Live in a Connected World (London:\nChatto & Windus, 1997).\n56 Robert Cooper, The Post-Modern State and the World Order (London: Demos, 2000).\n57 On the double nature of modernity and globalisation, see Ian Clark, Globalisation and\nFragmentation: International Relations in the Twentieth Century (Oxford: Oxford University Press,\n1997).\n58 Karl Polanyi, The Great Transformation (New York: Rinehart & Company, 1944).\n492 George Lawson\nresemblance to its predecessor. Contrast the case of South Africa with the current\nstate of affairs in West Asia, particularly in Iraq, and it becomes clear that there is no\ninevitable set of conditions which dictate that future transformations will be carried\nout along relatively peaceful lines. Rather, the prospect and actuality of violent\nconflict remains one of depressing familiarity to people all around the world. In\nMyanmar, Cuba, North Korea, Turkmenistan, Togo and other such societies,\nauthoritarian regimes hold an unsustainable grip on their publics. If the events of\n1989 and after tell us anything, it is that even the most apparently unyielding of\nsystems is inherently unstable. The essential question of our times is, will this\ninstability be resolved through the pitched battles and firing squads common to times\nof yore or via the roundtables and negotiated settlements which offer an alternative\npath out of seemingly intractable conflicts?\nNegotiated revolutions are reminders of the persistent capacity of world historical\nprocesses, inherent in human agency, to surprise: there were few academics, activists\nor mystics who foresaw the collapse of communism, the end of apartheid or the\noverthrow of the Pinochet regime. As such, it does not seem out of place to see\nnegotiated revolutions as a contemporary form of what E. H. Carr calls a \u2018realistic\nutopia\u2019: the promotion of peaceful change rooted in the conditions of the age, yet\nwhich carry with them the possibility of progress.59 Over upcoming years, we will see\nwhether negotiated revolutions traverse the recalcitrant line between idealism and\nrealism, avoiding the perils of an overly optimistic, na\u0131\u00a8ve altruism on the one hand\nand the crudeness of a raw struggle for power on the other. Either way, it is clear that\nthe age of revolutions is not over. The debate which has raged since the time of Paine\nand Burke over the two faces of revolution remains one of immense significance to\nthe contemporary world.\n59 Unfortunately, Carr\u2019s vision of a world in which \u2018British policy must take into account the welfare\nof Lille or D\u00fcsseldorf or Lodz as well as the welfare of Oldham or Jarrow\u2019 looks unrealistic even\ntoday, 65 years after it was first proposed.
