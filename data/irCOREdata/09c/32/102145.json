Sociological research shows that friendship and partner choice tend to \nreveal a bias toward social similarity. These relations are ruled by the so called \n\u201cproximity principle\u201d which states that the more similar two individuals are, the \nmore likely they will become friends.

To introduce these theoretical \nconcepts we decided to fuzzify the system, explaining the process in detail. Thus, \nwe end up with fuzzy sets and operations, a fuzzy friendship relationship, and a \nlogistic function for its evolution.  \nKeywords: agent-based modelling, friendship, fuzzy agent, fuzzy logic, social \nsimulation. \n1   Introduction \nThe dynamics of social relationships is a highly complex field to study. Even though \nit can be found many literature regarding friendship networks, weak links \/ acquaint-\nances, relationship evolution and so on, we are still far from understanding all the \nprocesses involved. Social research has shown that people use numerous criteria when \nthey consider the possibility of turning an acquaintance into a friend. But this paper \nconsiders only one: socio-demographical characteristics of people (i.e. ideology, age) \nthat determine the emergence and evolution of friendship. After studying the theory \navailable, we have decided to use the \u201cproximity principle\u201d in order to model the \nfriendship dynamics. This principle assesses that the more similar two individuals are, \nthe stronger their chances of becoming friends. Thus, we attempt to model the proc-\nesses in which strangers turn to be acquaintances, those turn into friends, and some \nfriends into couples. \nIn order to do that, we will work with an Agent-Based Model (ABM) which al-\nready handles social relationships: Mentat [1], which is deeply described. However, \nthe application of the friendship modelling in the ABM has been accomplished using \n524 S. Hassan, M. Salgado, and J. Pavon \nfuzzy logic. Therefore, we expose how the theory has been guiding the fuzzification \nprocess step by step, resulting in a new ABM called Fezztat. The whole process con-\nsisted in the fuzzification of the agent characteristics, the similarity process, the fuzzi-\nfication of the friendship relationship together with the introduction of an evolution \nfunction, and a new couples matchmaking calculation. Comparing the results of the \ndifferent ABM we might assess that the fuzzy version deals with the problem in a \nmore accurate way. \nThe section 2 explains some theoretical concepts of friendship dynamics. Section 3 \nresumes the needed basics of fuzzy logic, while the next one describes the Mentat \nABM. Section 5 analyzes the fuzzification process, and the last two parts finish with a \ndiscussion about the results obtained and conclusions. \n2   Friendship Dynamics \n2.1   Understanding Friendship \nSelecting a friend is among the most personal of human choices, and thus it is not \nsurprising that friendship groups tend toward social homogeneity. Members of the \nworking class usually associate with other workers, and middle-class individuals \ngenerally choose friends who are middle class.  \nA preliminary step to constructing a friendship modelling is an examination of the \nway that the social context structures friendship choice. Contextual explanations for \nindividual behaviour argue that (i) individual preferences and actions are influenced \nthrough social interaction, and (ii) social interaction is structured by the individual's \nsocial characteristics [2]. This is consistent with the important homophily principle in \nsocial networks of [3]. Principles of meeting and \u201cmating\u201d by which strangers are \nconverted to acquaintances, acquaintances to friends, and even maybe friends into \npartner, follow the same rules. Meeting depends on opportunities alone (that is, to be \nin the same place at the same time); instead, mating depends on both opportunities \nand attraction. How readily an acquaintance is converted to close friendship depends \non how attractive two people find each other and how easily they can get together. \nThe \u201cproximity principle\u201d indicates that the more similar people are, the more \nlikely they will meet and become friends [4]. Therefore, features like social status, \nattitudes, beliefs and demographic characteristics (that is, degree of \u201cmutual similar-\nity\u201d) channel individual preferences and they tend to show more bias toward homoge-\nneous friendship choices. \n2.2   A Friendship Evolution Function \nSimilarity, proximity or friendship are vague or blurry categories, because they do not \nhave clear edges. For this reason, we have developed a formal model of friendship \ndyads using the general framework presented above, but considering similarity and \nfriendship as continuous variables. Besides, because friendship occurs through time, \nwe have considered our model in dynamic terms. \nWe conceive the friendship process as a search for compatible associates, in terms \nof the proximity principle, and where strangers are transformed to acquaintances and \nacquaintances to friends as a continuous process over time. \n Friends Forever: Social Relationships with a Fuzzy Agent-Based Model 525 \n \nFig. 1. Graphs showing exponential growth of J and the logistic friendship function \nWe propose the hypothesis that a logistic function [5] can describe formally the \n\u201cfriendship relation\u201d or degree of friendship for every couple of individuals. The \nlogistic function is one of the most useful (and heavily exploited) modelling strategies \nused in the social sciences. In order to model the evolution of friendship, we have \nspecified it as in Equation 1: \nrtKtF\ndt\ndF\ntW \u00d7\u00d7== )()()(   (1) \nThe equation expresses the hypothesis that friendship increases over time; thus, at \neach point of time, F(t) defines the minimum degree of friendship that is given as an \ninitial condition (0 < F(t) < K); K is the maximum degree of friendship that agents \ncan reach (K can be understood as the level of \u201cclose friends\u201d), and finally r value \ndefines the growth rate of friendship. However, this equation does not include the \n\u201cproximity principle\u201d described above. We can include this principle in equation (1) \nby modifying the growth rate r and stating it as follows: the more similar in social \ncharacteristics two individuals are, the higher the growth rate of their friendship is \n(we need to make r sensitive to the similarity value). Thus, we can express the follow-\ning equation:  \nJSr \u00d7=   (2) \nWhere S is a measure of similarity and J defines a multiplicative factor that increases \nthe magnitude of S within r. The objective of J is turning r more sensitive to S values, \nand specially sensitive to high S values. For this reason, J describes an exponential \ngrowth depending on S values. We can formalize J as follows:  \npseJsJ \u00d7= 0)(  (3) \nWhere J0 is the initial value of J, P defines the constant of proportionality and S is the \nsimilarity value between the individuals. In the following graphs we can see how the \nfriendship will develop over time given different initial conditions1. \n                                                          \n1\n In the Graph 1 of Figure 1 it is assumed that P is equal to 5.8 and J0 is equal to 0.001. In \nGraph 2 it is assumed that K is equal to 1 and F0 is equal to 0.01; r value is equal to S x J(s). \nThe constants were generated by experimental procedures. \n526 S. Hassan, M. Salgado, and J. Pavon \n3   Be Fuzzy, My Friend \n3.1   Why, What and When Fuzzy Logic \nIndividuals are often vague about their beliefs, desires and intentions. They use lin-\nguistic categories with blurred edges and gradations of membership, for instance: \n\u201cacquainted or friend\u201d. Fuzzy logic is oriented at modelling the imprecise modes of \nreasoning in environment of uncertainty and vagueness [6]. Thus, because vagueness \nis such a common thing in the social realm, fuzzy logic provides us with a useful way \nto handle this vagueness systematically and constructively [7]. \nFuzzy logic shows that if A is a fuzzy set in a universe of discourse U, then  \nevery member of U has a grade of membership in A between 0 and 1 (instead of the \nclassical two-valued-logic). This membership function defines A as a fuzzy subset  \nof U [8]. According to this framework, the mapping of the function is denoted by ma: \nA \u00c6 [0,1].  \n3.2   The Importance of Fuzzy Logic in ABM \nThere is an increasing interest among social scientists for adding fuzzy logic to the \nsocial science toolbox [9]. Likewise, even though it is still incipient, there are numer-\nous examples of researches linking fuzzy logic with social simulation. For instance, in \nsome ABM, agents decide according to fuzzy logic rules; \u201cfuzzy controls\u201d or \u201cfuzzy \nagents\u201d are expert systems based in \u201cIf \u00c6 Then\u201d rules where the premises and con-\nclusions are unclear. Unlike traditional multi-agent models, where these completely \ndetermined agents are an over-simplification of real individuals, fuzzy agents take \ninto account the stochastic component of the human behaviour. \nSome authors have proposed to improve the agents' strategy choices within the it-\nerated prisoner's dilemma using fuzzy logic decision-rules [10]. Others researchers \nhave claimed that simulation based on two-player games can use fuzzy strategies \nwhen analytic solutions do not exist or are computationally very difficult to obtain \n(because agents use fuzzy strategies; i.e., \u201cIf I think my opponent will choose action \nx, I will choose action y\u201d) [11]. Examples of multi-agent based models are the fate of \nspatial dilemmas [12], an extension of sugar space model with fuzzy agents [13] and \ncomputational modelling of \u201cfuzzy love and romance\u201d [14]. \n4   The Case Study: Mentat, the Original ABM \nTherefore, to study the friendship dynamics commented, an ABM has been chosen for \nits fuzzification. The aim of the Mentat model [15, 1] is to understand the evolution of \nthe moral values in Spain from 1980 to 2000. It carries out an analysis of the evolu-\ntion of multiple factors in the period, trying to determine to which extent the demo-\ngraphic dynamics explains the magnitude of mentality change in Spain. Due to its \nbroad spectrum, it needs to cope with: gender, age, education, economy, political \nideology, religiosity, family, friend relationships, matchmaking and reproduction \npatterns, demographic dynamics, life cycles and others. The aggregated statistics of \nthese variables evolve over time, together with the agent network. \n Friends Forever: Social Relationships with a Fuzzy Agent-Based Model 527 \nThe agents in Mentat are initialised using data from the Spanish census, research \nstudies and sample surveys [16]. Thus, each agent has different values of their attrib-\nutes, with a behaviour deeply influenced by distributions representing demographic \nrules (life expectancy, fertility rate, etc).  \nThe simulation has been configured with a population of 3000 static agents, ran-\ndomly distributed in a space 100x100 (thus, around one agent each 3.3 cells), and \nsimulated for a period of 20 years (1000 agent steps). The agents are able to commu-\nnicate, establishing friendship and couple relationships, and reproduce. The commu-\nnication is always local, with a Moore neighbourhood of distance 6 (168 cells). This \nmeans that an agent will be able to communicate with around 50 other \u201cpossible \nfriends\u201d along its life. From these, each agent will be able to choose, which ones will \nbe its friends. This election will be determined by a probability directly proportional \nto a similarity measure between the two agents. \nIt should be mentioned that agents are randomly distributed in the space because \nthe context of an individual can be initially considered random: in which neighbour-\nhood you grew, in which university did you study. Only with the common context \nalready chosen, the individuals can relate with each other taking into account non-\nrandom factors: once the student is in the university, they will decide whom will be \ntheir friends. \nAn agent will choose a couple among their friends, if certain conditions are given: \nreproduction probability taken into account the age and the demographic distribu-\ntions; election of the \u201ccandidates\u201d based on boolean conditions as \u201cnot child\u201d, \u201cnot \nmarried\u201d, \u201csame sex\u201d, etc; candidate choice determined by the similarity rate. These \nrules are consistent with the friendship dynamics explained in the section 2. Again \naccording to the demography implemented, the couples will give birth a certain num-\nber of children that will inherit their characteristics and values. \nThus, the agents form a network where the nodes are the individuals and the links \ncan be of type \u201cfriend\u201d or \u201cfamily\u201d (couple, parents, children). The more friendships \nexist, the more couples and families will be formed. However, it is not only the quan-\ntity which is important: the matchmaking process should return similar couples, \nminimizing the exceptional cases where two very different people are married. \n5   Fuzzification of Mentat \n5.1   The Baby's First Steps: Attributes and Similarity \nApplying the concepts of section 3 into Mentat, it has been modified, step by step, \nfuzzifying a collection of aspects: agent characteristics, similarity measure, friendship \nrelationship, and the matchmaking process. Besides, we will introduce the friendship \nevolution function previously mentioned in section 2. The result ABM has been called \nFezztat. \nMentat uses a similarity function for several purposes, as it has already been ex-\nplained. It is built with a gratification method based on the comparison of the agent \nattributes. However, the technique is not very sophisticated and could be improved. \nThe use of fuzzy logic would significantly increase its accuracy. But if we want to use \n528 S. Hassan, M. Salgado, and J. Pavon \nfuzzy operators, first we have to fuzzify the variables where they are applied or, for-\nmally, define fuzzy sets over these variables. \nThus, the agent attributes, very different from each other, were normalized in the \nreal interval [0, 1]. For example, we would have the fuzzy set \u03bceconomy:U\u00c6[0,1], and \nan individual with a \u03bceconomy (ind) = 0.7 would be a person quite wealthy. \nAfterwards, the fuzzy similarity can be defined using a T-indistinguishability, \nwhich generalizes the classical equivalence relations. The mathematical explanation \nbeneath it can be found in [17], but roughly the distance between the attributes of the \ntwo agents compared is \u201chow far are they\u201d, so its negation will point out \u201chow similar \nare they\u201d. The aggregation of each couple of attribute similarities will return the total \nsimilarity rate. The negation used is a fuzzy strong negation N [18] and the aggrega-\ntion an OWA operator [19]. And so, the relation is:  \n)))(),(((,(),( 22 indinddNindOWAindindR iiisimilarity \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc \u2208\u2200=  (4) \nAn OWA is a family of multicriteria combination (aggregation) procedures. By \nspecifying suitable order weights (which sum will result always 1) it is possible to \nchange the form of aggregation. The arithmetic average in the example OWA would \nneed a value of 1\/n to each weight (where \u201cn\u201d would be the number of attributes). \nThrough these weights, it is possible to control the importance of each attribute in the \nglobal similarity. \n5.2   Growing-Up: Friendship and Couples \nAlthough the agents comparisons have been improved with the previous method, the \npotential of this new subtle similarity function would not be used if left like that. \nSupporting what it was pointed out in section 2, we will link the concepts of similarity \nand friendship in a fuzzy way. For doing so, the friendship is turned into a fuzzy rela-\ntionship, completely different from its boolean nature in Mentat. This relationship is \nnaturally \u201cfuzzy\u201d, and the previous use (to be or not to be a friend) was an over-\nsimplification not found in reality: in real world, there is a continuous range of de-\ngrees of friendship. With the new Rfriend: UxU \u00c6[0,1], each agent has a range from \nclose friends to acquaintances. \nNow that it is formally defined, it is needed to specify an evolution for it. There-\nfore, the friendship logistic function of (1) is used here. Every \u201cstep\u201d of time, each \nagent will update its friendship with its linked agents. Depending on how similar they \nare, and how old is their friendship, they will end up being very close friends or just \nstay as acquaintances. Formally (where W is the already defined logistic function (1) \nand tfriend is the time of friendship):  \n)),(),,((),( 222 indindRindindtWindindR similarityfriendfriend =  (5) \nThe final improvement through fuzzy logic is related to couples and the matchmak-\ning process. The \u201chas couple\u201d relation is clearly boolean and cannot be fuzzified. But \nthe process of choosing the couple, as it was described in the section 4, can take into \naccount new information obtained with the modifications already made. Mentat has \nseveral boolean conditions for filtering the \u201ccandidates\u201d, and these can not be changed \n(\u201csame sex\u201d or \u201cnot married\u201d are impossible to fuzzify). The similarity function that \n Friends Forever: Social Relationships with a Fuzzy Agent-Based Model 529 \nuses has already been improved. And now we propose to introduce the friendship \ndegree in the selection. \nTherefore, it has been defined a new relationship \u201ccompatible\u201d that will measure \nthe possibilities of a candidate to be selected as a couple:  \n)),(),,((),( 222 indindRindindROWAindindR similarityfriendcompatible =  (6) \nThe weights of the OWA can be redefined depending on the importance given to \neach term. After some experimentation, Fezztat uses equal weights. It could be argued \nthat, as the friendship evolution already takes into account the similarity, this one \nwould not be necessary, as its information is already included. However, the friend-\nship relationship can achieve its maximum with several candidates of the same agent, \nand it is specially in those cases where the similarity is very useful. \n6   Results and Discussion \nHere we present a comparison between several versions of the ABM. Four different \nimplementations, each one with two configurations have been analyzed, focusing in \nthree measures. The fuzzy modifications have been grouped in two main ones: \u201cFuzz-\nSim\u201d, when the attributes are normalized and the similarity operator fuzzified, as \nstands the subsection 5.1; and \u201cFuzz-Fri\u201d, when the friendship turns to be fuzzy, \nevolving over time and affecting the partner choice (subsection 5.2). The four ABM \nrepresent all the possible combinations between these, represented in the table 1 in the \npair (Fuzz-Sim, Fuzz-Fri). Thus, we have the classic version of Mentat explained in \nsection 4, with no fuzzy properties; the MentatFuzzSim, simply the same ABM but with \nthe \u201cFuzz-Sim\u201d; the MentatFuzzFri with \u201cFuzz-Fri\u201d but not \u201cFuzz-Sim\u201d; and last Fezztat, \nwith all the fuzzy modifications. \nThe two configurations deal with two possible ways of friendship emerging: one \npromoting random friends (and therefore an agent can be linked to a non-similar \nneighbor) and the other promoting similarity-based friends (and therefore an agent \nwill rarely be linked to a non-similar neighbor, as it will give priority to the most \nsimilar ones). This is not a trivial decision, because the friendship evolution function \nalready deals with similarity, and if a neighbor is not similar at all, it will never be \nmore than an acquaintance. It is not evident if the closer way to real-world is giving \ndouble strength to similarity (in the second option) or letting randomness to decide \nwho will be the friend (and thus maybe ignoring similar people). It has to be men-\ntioned that none of the two configurations is so deterministic and both are based on \nprobabilities. \nThe parameters analyze the couples and how they are affected by the changes in \nthe configuration and fuzzification. The RSimilarity shows the proximity taking into \naccount all the characteristics of each partner in a couple. The RFriend focuses in the \nfriendship link between them, which in a way (according to the logistic function) \ndepends in their similarity too, but also in the time spent together. The RCompatibility is \ntaken as an average of the other two. The values have been obtained after averaging \nthe output of several executions of each version. And in every execution, it is the \nmean of the property in every couple. \n530 S. Hassan, M. Salgado, and J. Pavon \nAs the first two ABM has a boolean friendship, their compatibility is always the \nsame as the similarity. In the first configuration, when the friendship is rarely in-\nvolved in the neighbors linked, the similarity rates are very similar in all the versions. \nHowever, in the second one it's clear that the ones with fuzzy similarity slightly in-\ncrease their success. But the bigger changes can be observed in the friendship: Fezztat \nbeats the other versions with a greater RFriend and RCompatibility, specially in the second \nconfiguration. These results approach the theoretical qualitative assessments. \nFinally, we compared the four different orders of fuzzification described above for \nboth RSimilarity and RFriend of couples, by using the statistical test \u201cOne-Way Analysis of \nVariance'', in order to detect evidence of difference among the population means. The \nFisher's statistical significance test equals to 7.281, with a P-value P < .0001. This \nsmall P-value provides strong evidence against null hypothesis, namely, that the dif-\nference in the means among the four orders of fuzzification are by chance, both for \nRSimilarity and RFriend of couples. Therefore, the differences among the means analysed \ncan be attributed to model's fuzzification. \nTable 1.

After justifying the suitability of fuzzy logic in this context, we proceeded to \napply it in an existing ABM. Therefore, we defined fuzzy sets over each agent attrib-\nute, and a new fuzzy similarity operator that would influence friendship emergence \nand partner choice. The friendship relationship nature and importance in the model \nwas significantly modified, fuzzifying it, making it evolve using the defined logistic \nfunction, and letting it influence in the partner choice as much as the similarity rate. \nThe results of these changes are clearly positive, as long as they improve the prox-\nimity to the qualitative assessments of the theory. \nTo sum up, we have exposed a theory, formalized it, searched where it can be ap-\nplied, found the useful tools to do that, implemented the application and extracted a \ncollection of results that are used to validate the model against the theory. This vali-\ndated formalization of the theory could be useful for further study in the field. \n Friends Forever: Social Relationships with a Fuzzy Agent-Based Model 531 \nFuture research lines that could be followed could take into account other interest-\ning friendship theories. There are deep studies in homophily in social networks [3] \nthat could be implemented. An aspect that our model ignores but it is important \nenough to be considered is the stability of friendship [20]. Besides, Fezztat could be \nextended to analyze the importance of weak links along one's life, a new possibility \nthat Mentat did not allow. \n \nAcknowledgments.
