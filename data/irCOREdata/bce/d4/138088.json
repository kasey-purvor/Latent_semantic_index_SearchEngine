Although it is acknowledged that corporate responsibility (CR) relates to the \ninterlink between society and business (Wood, 1991), we are still unclear about how the \nmechanisms of this interweaving between firms and society (Russo and Fouts, 1997). In \nparticular there is still a great deal of debate about the impact of firms corporate \nresponsibility activities and the enhancement of their competitiveness and economic \nperformance. A key issue for business managers is how to respond to the wider \nexpectations by governments and society of business in both wealth creation and creating \nsocial cohesion whilst still staying close to their core purpose This means that business \ncannot move too far from its core purpose or product and so involvement needs to be \nstrategic (e.g. Moir and Taffler(2004); Saiia et al., (2003)). Porter and Kramer (2002) \nargue that firms should focus their efforts where both the company and society benefit \nbecause the firm brings unique assets and expertise to address important social and \neconomic goals. In this article we describe the experience of Microsoft in developing \ntraining and supporting employability. Using both resource-based view of the firm \n(Barney, 1991; 2001) and Industrial Organisation economics (Caves, 1980; Porter, 1980) \narguments we suggest that two of Microsoft\u2019s CR activities namely the \u201821st Century \nskills for employability\u2019 programme and the involvement in the \u2018European Alliance on \nSkills for Employability\u2019 can be argued to be a source of sustainable competitive \nadvantage. We also argue that key aspects of these programmes are the business-to-\nbusiness and stakeholder partnerships and that these may be an effective approach to \naddress broad and complex societal issues such as unemployment and education. \nBefore detailing these two initiatives we first describe the socio- economic context in \nEurope and briefly outline the principles of Industrial Organisation economics and the \nresource-based view.  \n \nTHE EUROPEAN CONTEXT \n \nVirtually every government in Europe is struggling to fight unemployment and create \nnew jobs for its citizens. With an increasing ageing population, over 18 million \nunemployed, pressure from globalisation on traditional manufacturing industries and \nmany national budgets increasingly under pressure, effective remedies are needed for the \nmedium and long term health of the European Union. Labour market reform and other \nstructural changes to increase job creation are receiving the most attention as the catalysts \nfor creating higher employment however extending people\u2019s work life through active \nageing policies, making job contracts more flexible or reforming pension systems are \ndifficult and unpopular decisions that most governments want to introduce gradually.  \n \nThese measures alone are unlikely to be enough. Policy makers are realising that people \nhave to be equipped with skills and competencies to satisfy the changing requirements of \nmodern labour markets. This is why governments and industry all agree on the urgent \nneed to strengthen science and technology training in higher education. However, the \nbroader needs further down the skills ladder must not be forgotten or penalized in favour \nof a more privileged sector of the workforce. Without a proper balance, the skills needed \nto generate competitiveness and growth through higher value-added goods and services \nwill not be available. Services rather than manufacturing are now the keystone of our \neconomies and their paramount need is for a workforce in which certain common, or \nuniversal, skills are readily available.  These universal skills should include good \nnumeracy and literacy, business and operational skills and, in particular, at least a degree \nof basic information technology (IT) capabilities. IT skills not only empower people but \nalso translate into higher productivity and economic growth. Better IT skills and more use \nof computer technology demonstrably improve productivity in the workplace, especially \namong SMEs. At the same time, IT and related skills are tools that would allow the \nunderprivileged in Europe access to wider employment opportunities and give them more \nconfidence in trying to enter today\u2019s labour market.  \n \nGAINING ADVANTAGE \nStrategic management is concerned with how some organisations outperform others i.e. \nhow they achieve superior advantage in the markets they operate in.  Put bluntly strategy \nis about winning. How firms achieve advantage is complex, but there are broadly two \nexplanations. One relates to Industrial Organisation economics and the other to the \nresource based view of the firm. While sometimes these two approaches of how a firm \ncan reach superior performance are explained in opposition to each other, they actually \ndescribe different aspects of the same words and hence it may be more appropriate to \nconsider the perspectives as a complementing each other. \n \nThe basic argument of Industrial Organisation economics (IO) is that competitive \nadvantage derives from privileged market positions. The emphasis of this theory is on the \nexternal environment. It argues that the prime determinant of an organisation's \nperformance is its external environment, the structure of the competition and industry it \nbelongs to. Hence the goal of the firm is to achieve optimal positioning in the most \nattractive markets. \n The basic argument of the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) is that competitive \nadvantage is generated from within the firm. The firm's resources are its main source of \nadvantage, in particular those resources that are simultaneously valuable, rare, \nimperfectly imitable and imperfectly substitutable. The emphasis is here on internal \nresources, how unique and different they are in comparison to those of the competitors. \nThe aim is to exploit these differences to achieve competitive advantage.  \n \nWe now explain how Microsoft\u2019s initiative aims at improving the European situation and \nalso how we believe that there is a convergence of interest between Microsoft and \nEurope\u2019s Jobs and Growth Strategy. \n \nMICROSOFT\u2019S \u201821ST CENTURY SKILLS FOR EMPLOYABILITY\u2019 \n \nOne of Microsoft\u2019s initiatives helps address the greatest challenge facing Europeans and \ntheir governments: unemployment. Europe also needs a knowledge economy workforce \ni.e. one in which all citizens have basic IT skills and future generations gain these skills \nas part of their education. Europe also requires people with advanced IT skills to provide \ninfrastructure and innovation.  \n \nMicrosoft has initiated the \u201821st Century Skills For Employability\u2019 programme. By \npartnering with governments, business, the education sector and community groups, \nMicrosoft aims to develop skills that will enable people to undertake more interesting, \nbetter paid work, adapt to innovations in business processes, and improve productivity \nand competitiveness at the enterprise level. In committing to 21st Century Skills for \nEmployability across Europe Microsoft builds on a number of corporate programmes \nalready well established across the EU: \n \n\u2022 The Unlimited Potential programme, which has supported more than 2,000 community \ntechnology centres and reached out to over 2 million people in all parts of the EU25. In \nFebruary 2006 Microsoft announced an expansion of funding to more than $152 \nmillion in cash and software world wide. These new grants will support 126 non-profit \norganisations that are expanding existing programmes or opening new centres in 64 \ncountries, bringing the total to 36,000 centres benefiting more than 15 million people \nworldwide. \n\u2022 The IT Academies programme, which has to date supported more than 2,000 \naccredited academic institutions to provide half a million students with a premium \neducation in the latest Microsoft technologies. \n\u2022 The Partners in Learning programme, which supports primary and secondary schools \nto increase access to technology. To date Microsoft has signed Partners in Learning \nmemoranda of understanding with 22 EU governments providing certified IT skills \ntraining to over half a million teachers. \n \nIn summary with its \u201821st Century Skills For Employability\u2019 initiative Microsoft and its \npartners help thousands of Europeans to access training opportunities that will help them \nto get back into the workforce.  \nMICROSOFT\u2019S EMPLOYABILITY INITIATIVE: NEW SKILLS FOR \nUNEMPLOYED TEXTILE WORKERS IN PORTUGAL \n \nJust one example of the 21st Century Skills for Employability initiative in action is the \nTechnology, Innovation and Initiative programme (TII).  Launched in January, the TII is \na unique partnership between the Technological Centre for the Textile and Clothing \nIndustries of Portugal (CITEVE) and Microsoft, to provide unemployed workers in \nPortugal\u2019s textiles industry with new skills and qualifications to enhance their long-term \nemployability prospects. Supported by the Unlimited Potential programme, TII aims to \ntrain at least 3,000 unemployed workers from Portugal\u2019s textile sector, which is being \nsignificantly affected by increasing global competition. The TII training will equip the \nparticipants with new skills needed in the local economy. CITEVE, together with the \nInstituto do Emprego e Forma\u00e7\u00e3o Profissional (The Institute for Employment and \nProfessional Training of the Ministry of Work and Social Solidarity), will also work with \nlocal companies and unions to help the trainees find new jobs or start new businesses. \nHelder Rosendo, CITEVE\u2019s general manager explained the problem. \u201cThe European \ntextiles industries are experiencing a paradigm shift due to the undisputable \ncompetitiveness of Asian countries in the sector, forcing Portuguese companies to make \nstronger bets on research and development, design, logistics and distribution. In this \nscenario, IT and human resources skills and training are of great importance. A \nprogramme such as TII that aims to improve the skills and knowledge of the unemployed \nworkers by training them in IT clearly improves their re-employment prospects either in \nthe same industry or other industries where these skills are required\u201d. Behind every \nstatistic there is a person looking for a new or better job to provide for his or her family. \nBehind every partnership there is a potential to lift someone out of dependence. By \napplying an innovative approach to delivering IT skills, Microsoft and its partners have \nalready shown they can make a difference. And they are committed to continuing and \nfurthering these efforts. \n \nCORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AS A WAY TO RECONCILE EUROPE\u2019S \nTWIN STRATEGY OF COMPETITIVENESS, JOBS AND GROWTH \n \nThe \u201821st Century Skills For Employability\u2019 is not the only initiative Microsoft is \ncommitted to that addresses Europe\u2019s concerns regarding competitiveness, employment \nand social security (Commission of the European Communities, 2006). The importance \nof CR at EU level and the strong link made between corporate responsibility strategies \nand the European Competitiveness, Jobs and Growth strategy is reflected in the  latest EU \nCSR communication and in other EU strategies launched in the first half of 2006, \nincluding the European Globalisation adjustment Fund and the Spring Council of the \nEuropean Union.  They all demonstrate the vision of the European Commission to \nmobilise the resources and capacities of European business to make Europe a pole of \nexcellence on CSR. \n \nThe particular initiative which looks at employability is the EU Commission \nCommunication on Corporate Social Responsibility and the CSR Alliance which brought \ntogether mainly industry actors and the Commission. Commission Vice-President G\u00fcnter \nVerheugen, responsible for enterprise and industry policy said: \"This Alliance will help \nreconcile Europe's economic, social and environmental ambitions. The Commission has \nopted for a voluntary approach which is more effective and less bureaucratic. Since CSR \nis about voluntary business behaviour, we can only encourage it if we work with \nbusiness. Europe needs a public climate in which entrepreneurs are appreciated not just \nfor making good profits but also for making a fair contribution to addressing societal \nchallenges.\"  Improving the climate and conditions for business in Europe creates a \ncorresponding need for more self-discipline on the part of the business community. In \nthis context, CSR is increasingly important for the smooth functioning of the market \neconomy. \n \nThe other key business-led initiative which has been designed to help answer the EU\u2019s \nneeds for investment in training and human capital is the European Alliance on Skills for \nEmployability. \n \nTHE EUROPEAN ALLIANCE ON SKILLS FOR EMPLOYABILITY \n \nIn Europe, Microsoft is a founding member of the European Alliance on Skills for \nEmployability. The Alliance partners are the e-Skills Certification Consortium and its \nmembers Microsoft, Cisco, European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) Foundation \nCompTIA and EXIN, together with Fast Track to IT (FIT), Randstad and State Street \nCorporation. Together this group will invest millions in both cash and in-kind to help \ntrain and provide access to technology content and certification to 20 million Europeans \nby 2010. \n \nThe Alliance shares a strong commitment to support the European Union\u2019s Jobs and \nGrowth Partnership. Its goal is to facilitate the provision of skills training for \nemployability to disadvantaged groups: young under- and unemployed workers, older at-\nrisk workers, and people with disabilities. The Alliance will work to raise awareness on \nthe importance of delivering skills for employability in Europe by promoting business-to-\nbusiness partnerships and collaborations for sustainable growth, jobs and \ncompetitiveness. With each partner contributing its core competencies, programs and \nresources toward a common goal, the Alliance has the potential to offer new \nopportunities to millions of people throughout Europe, particularly those at the bottom of \nthe skills pyramid. Working with government, industry and NGO partners across Europe \nthe Alliance will be investing in partnerships that aim to support and assisttoday\u2019s \nuntapped work force i.e. unemployed youth who have dropped out of education and the \nover-50s who need new skills, and confidence to find jobs later in life to gain basic IT \nskills for work and life through local community IT training centres, IT academies and \nonline training; \n \nAs a result the Alliance will support Europe\u2019s 20 million small and medium sized \nenterprises, which are critical to the EU economy, by widening their recruitment base of \nlocal people able to use IT as tools for business growth and innovation. \n \n \nMICROSOFT\u2019S EMPLOYABILITY INITIATIVES AND SUPERIOR \nPERFORMANCE \n \nThe initiatives from Microsoft and its partners certainly add social value in terms of \nEuropean employability and developing social welfare but does it make sense for \nMicrosoft\u2019s strategy in the short and long term? And, if it does make sense, why \nundertake such activities on a partnership basis instead of going it alone and taking all the \ncredit? Does it make sense to commit to such broad scale initiatives if one wants to create \nsustainable competitive advantage, generate profits and optimize shareholders value? \nWhile there is no doubt that there are costs involved in setting up and managing such \nprogrammes we propose that the strategic benefits outweigh the cost and that the \nadvantage for Microsoft are beyond those of enhanced goodwill and its associated \nmarketing benefits. \n \nMicrosoft\u2019s Employability Partnership Initiatives and their Impact on the External \nEnvironment \n \nFrom IO economics we know that firms will achieve superior performance if they are in \nan industry that is attractive to them. Such an environment or competitive context is made \nup of four elements: factor conditions, or the available inputs of production; demand \nconditions; the context for strategy and rivalry; and related and supporting industries \n(Porter, 1990). In an environment where all the factors are favourable to the firm it is \nmore likely to generate superior performance than in an environment where the \nconditions are not that favourable. We will argue just below that Microsoft\u2019s \nemployability initiatives are key to render its competitive context attractive and as such \nwill help Microsoft sustain long term business development. \n \nFactor conditions relate to the availability of high quality specialised inputs such as \nhuman and capital resources, physical infrastructure, scientific and technological \ninfrastructure (Porter and Kramer, 2002). If we relate back to Microsoft and the two \ninitiatives we described above we can argue that the \u201821st Century skills for \nemployability\u2019 and the \u2018European Alliance on Skills for Employability\u2019 programmes will \nenhance Microsoft competitive context. The programme aims directly at improving the \ncurrent human resources and the technological infrastructure, i.e. it will improve \nMicrosoft\u2019s factor conditions. \n \nDemand conditions include the size of the local market, the appropriateness of product \nstandards, and the sophistication of local customers (Porter, 1990). With its two \ninitiatives Microsoft and the partner organisations are influencing the demand conditions. \nBy providing millions of Europeans with access to technology, content, certification and \ntraining in computer technology, the Alliance is in effect creating a market and is \nincreasing the sophistication of the customers or developing prospective customers in the \nmedium term. Thanks to the training more Europeans are going to become computer \nsavvy and hence are going to become potential customers. One could of course argue that \nthey could become customers to any firms and not only those funding the \u2018European \nAlliance on Skills for Employability\u2019 but thanks to their commitment to the initiative the \ncompanies are gaining recognition and are gaining exposure and reaping intangible \ngoodwill benefits that competitors will not have and will not be able to exploit as the \nAlliance partners can. To this extent, this philanthropic initiative is similar to a medium-\nlong terms business development strategy. \n \nOur argument so far relating to how these CR initiatives can help Microsoft\u2019s economic \nobjectives were based on how they will have an impact on the industry structure. We \nhave shown that the initiatives will allow Microsoft to impact positively the structure of \nthe industry and render it attractive. We now argue that using resource-based view \nargument (Amit and Shoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991) that these Microsoft\u2019s \nemployability CR initiatives will generate the creation of internal resources that will help \nMicrosoft create sustainable competitive advantage from within. \n \nMicrosoft\u2019s Employability CR Initiatives and their Impact on the Internal \nEnvironment \n \nThe resource-based view proposes that to be a source of competitive advantage resources \nmust hold simultaneously a number of characteristics: \n\u2022 Resources must be valuable i.e. it must allow the firm to its efficiency and\/or \neffectiveness.  \n\u2022 Resources must be rare, i.e. they must not be possessed by a large number of firms.   \n\u2022 Resources must be imperfectly imitable, i.e. others firms cannot copy and thereby \nobtain equivalent resources.  If the firm\u2019s competitors can copy the resource and if they \nwere to do so the firm's advantage would be nullified. \n\u2022 Finally there cannot be any strategically equivalent substitutes for them.  If a resource \ncan be easily substituted by another resource that delivers the same effect then it cannot \nremain a source of competitive advantage. \n \nResources that meet all these criteria are often called core competencies (Prahalad and \nHamel, 1990).  \n \nOne can suggest that competitive advantage is very often no longer dependent on \ninvestments in machinery, on products' attributes or on any tangible resources, because of \nthe dynamic conditions of the market. Any tangible resources can be purchased or \nreplicated. Hence, we can propose that intangible assets such as knowledge, the skills and \ncapabilities firms are likely to be key to performance (Sobol and Lei, 1993; Bowman and \nAmbrosini, 2000). Basically this means people - human and social capital are the bases of \nsuccess, not equipment etc. This is in accordance with the argument that what matters \nmost in organisations are people (Pfeffer, 1995; Pfeffer and Veiga, 1999). It is in this \nrespect that the employability initiatives can be seen as critical to the generation of \ncorporate and societal competitive advantage. One of the outcomes of the initiatives \nshould be the availability of a skilled workforce attracted to work for a company to whom \nthey feel goodwill. To produce high quality products, to deliver impeccable service and \nto keep abreast of technological development organisations require skilled employees. \nThey need to hire employees who are able to share knowledge and develop firm specific \ncompetences. Without skilled employees firms cannot develop core competencies \n(Leonard-Barton, 1992). The core competence of the organization lies in the knowledge \nand skills of its people. Basic codified systems do not create competitive advantage. It is \nthe skills and abilities of people that dictate the future of the organisation.  \n \nOne can argue that another one key resource that is likely to be generated from the \nemployability initiatives is reputation. In a cut throat environment and in an environment \nmore and more sensitive to CR issues one can argue that firms associated with helping \nthe community by facilitating economic development will have a sales advantage above \nand beyond others. Reputation is a difficult resource to build it takes time and hence it is \ndifficult to copy. Further resources which have been created are the networks within the \nalliances and in particular with the European Commission. By working on developing \nand maintaining strong relationship with the EU commission companies are most likely \nto be able to influence policy making in such a way that confers an advantage (Russo and \nFouts, 1997). \n \nFinally, a key intangible asset that has been built is that of partnerships and networks. But \nthe advantage is not just for the organisations involved, but also society. Each partner \nbrings its own skills and adds at different levels of the value chain to provide both \ninternal assets but also leverages that effort to the benefit of society. In particular, \nworking at a government level, it allows projects to have sufficient scale both to be \neffective but also to command greater focus. \n \nConclusion and Reflection \n \nIn this article we have described how Microsoft has gained competitive advantage from \nCorporate Responsibility initiatives and so how these strategies are available to all firms. \nBut there remains our initial question of how to decide what activities to undertake and \nhow to gain that advantage. In reflecting on this experience, we can point to the following \nfeatures: \n\u2022 The activities were part of the core competencies of the business, so alignment \nof CR activities and core business delivers impact and sustainability. \n\u2022 Both society and Microsoft gained \u2013 but the social involvement wasn\u2019t only \ninstrumental \u2013 i.e. Microsoft didn\u2019t set out to do it to make money \u2013 this is \npart of what business does to last and sustain business success in the long \nterm.  In fact, in today\u2019s business world it needs more than good products to \nbe a great company. \n\u2022 The activities were coordinated with civil society, industry partners and \ngovernment and were part of a wider socio-economic agenda. \n\u2022 Microsoft didn\u2019t work alone \u2013 it had key partners \u2013 there is a network and a \nnew form of partnership that is emerging along the value chain that spans \nfrom \u201caccess to training to employment opportunities\u201d. \n\u2022 Microsoft\u2019s staff were directly involved and this is key in developing \nintangible assets and where competitive advantage is gained by knowledge \n\u2022 Inevitably resources and involvement has to be prioritised and having both a \nstrategy for social activities as well as clear targets helps set those priorities. \n \nWe may not yet understand the mechanisms that link business as part of society, but it is \nclear that business can be part of the solutions to some of society\u2019s problems. \n \nElements for further learning \n \n\u2022 This venture is very ambitious but it is only at its start.  The impact and outcomes \nstill have to be monitored and measured in the years ahead towards the \nachievement of the targets by the end of 2010. \n\u2022 Microsoft chose to bring forward a new partnership-based approach which \nincludes industry and other stakeholders. The effectiveness, benefits and barriers \nof such approach still need to be evaluated.  Surely it is best to look at the issue of \ntraining and unemployment with and end-to-end perspective, which mirrors every \nstep of the value chain and maximizes the value added of each partner at every \nstep. \n\u2022 While it is essential for a company to align its CR strategies to the policy \npriorities, there needs to be a balance with the company\u2019s core business in order \nto sustain and develop the programs in the long term.   In this case the three \nelements aligned perfectly. What would be the impact if this was not the case?  \n\u2022 How will the EU CSR Alliance act as an enabling environment for these types of \nnew CR activities which are attempting to balance policy making, societal and \nbusiness goals?  Is this a road to redefine, modernize and guarantee the \nsustainability of the European social model? \n \nReferences \n \nAmit, R. and Shoemaker, P.J.H.
