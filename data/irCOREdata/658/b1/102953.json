Although a number\nof studies have examined the expression of individual HOX\ngenes in defined blood cell lineages, we have undertaken a\ncomprehensive analysis of HOX gene expression in resting\nand activated lymphocytic and monocytic subpopulations.\nThis has revealed distinct patterns of expression between\ndifferent cell types and resting and activated states. (Main\ncategory A: Erythrocytes, Leukocytes and Hematopoiesis,\nsubcategory: 8: Lymphocytes).\nKeywords HOX \u0001 T-lymphocytes \u0001 B-lymphocytes \u0001\nMonocytes \u0001 Activation\n1 Introduction\nThe HOX genes are a family of homeodomain-containing\ntranscription factors that define specific positional identi-\nties, both in vertebrate and invertebrate embryos [4]. They\nare also involved in the regulation of haemopoiesis\n(reviewed by [13]), and blocking HOX gene function by the\nuse of antisense oligos or gene knock out perturbs a\nnumber of different haemopoietic events. Thus for example\nmyeloid, erythroid and lymphoid haemopoiesis are all\ndefective in HoxA9 knock out mice [8], and the antisense\nablation of HoxB5, HoxB6, HoxB7 [15], or HoxA5 [5]\nblocks erythroid differentiation. Forced expression of\nHOXA10 in CD34+ progenitor cells purified from cord\nblood results in a significant reduction in the number of B\ncells and natural killer cells but a marked increase in\nmonocytes [14]. There are also examples of specific reg-\nulatory functions for HOX genes, including the modulation\nof globin transcription by HOXB6 [12]. In addition, HOX\ngenes can also act to regulate the proliferation of haemo-\npoietic stem cells (HSCs). Hence HOXB4 is a strong,\npositive regulator of HSC self renewal (reviewed by [10]),\nand an estrogen-dependant version of HOXB8 can be used\nto drive the production of neutrophils and macrophages\nfrom their respective progenitor cells [16].\nDespite these studies, relatively little is still known\nabout the expression of HOX genes in the mature blood\nlineages (reviewed by [6]). In order to address this we\npurified different cell populations from human peripheral\nblood on the basis of their expression of the surface\nmarkers CD4, CD8, CD14 and CD19 that are present on T-\nlymphocytes (CD4 and CD8), monocytes, and B-lympho-\ncytes respectively. HOX expression was compared in\n\u2018resting\u2019 cells and cells that had been activated by chal-\nlenging with specific antigenic stimuli\u2014antibodies against\nCD2, CD3 and CD28 for CD4+ and CD8+ cells, Lipo-\npolysaccharide for CD14+ cells and anti-IgG for CD19+\ncells. Each population of cells underwent proliferation in\nresponse to this treatment, as measured by [3H]thymidine\nincorporation (Fig. 1). RNA was extracted from each cell\ntype and the expression of each of the 39 HOX genes was\nassed by quantitative PCR (QPCR), relative to the amount\nof Beta-actin transcript present (Fig. 2).\nThe highest level of expression is generally shown by\nthe HOXA and HOXC genes, with HOXD genes generally\nR.

For all of\nthe HOX genes expressed in CD4+ cells there is a signif-\nicant reduction in HOX expression upon activation. This is\nparticularly striking for the most posterior genes of the\nHOXA, HOXC and HOXD clusters. A similar pattern is also\nobserved in CD8+ cells, although there is a general\nreduction in HOX expression with every HOX gene except\nHOXC10 being present at lower levels in these cells.\nThere are a number of notable differences between the\nHOX expression profile of CD14+ cells and the CD4+\/CD8+\npopulations. HOXC4, HOXC6 and HOXC8 are not expres-\nsed. The most striking difference though is the change of\nHOX expression upon activation\u2014in contrast to CD4+\/\nCD8+ cells, CD14+ cells show a large increase in HOXA2,\nHOXB13, HOXC10, HOXC13, HOXD1 and HOXD9. Other\nHOX genes such as HOXB4 and HOXA10 show no signifi-\ncant change in expression upon activation, which again\ncontrasts with the response of CD4+\/CD8+ cells.\nCD19+ cells show a broadly similar pattern of HOX\nexpression to CD14+ cells prior to activation, but have a\ndistinct response to activation. Like CD4+\/CD8+ cells,\nCD19+ cells exhibit a large reduction in expression of most\nHOX genes with the exception of HOXD10, HOXD11 and\nHOXD12 that show a very strong increase in expression\nupon activation.\nTo our knowledge this is the first comprehensive anal-\nysis of HOX gene expression in these leukocyte\npopulations. Taking the data as a whole, each population\nshows a unique pattern of HOX expression that may define\ncellular identity. Generally the expression levels are in\nagreement with those previously reported for individual\nHOX genes in other studies [6, 7, 9]. However the changes\nof HOX gene expression upon cellular activation have not\npreviously been reported. The magnitude of these changes\nis striking, with the activated T cell subsets exhibiting an\nalmost complete loss of expression of many HOX genes\nespecially the more posterior members of the groups\nFig. 1 Proliferation of activated lymphocyte populations.

Expres-\nsion was assessed by quantitative PCR and is shown as a relative\nvalue to the number of beta-actin transcripts (\u2018Relative expression\u2019).\nHOX genes are abbreviated to show only their family and paralogue\nposition, hence HOXA2 is shown as \u2018A2\u2019. HOX genes for which no\nexpression was detected are not shown in the figure. Each value\nshown is the mean from three experiments. Significant changes in\nexpression levels (p \\ 0.05) 6 and 24 h after activation are marked\n(*). Error bars: SEM\nDifferential expression of HOX genes 247\n123\n(HOXA10, HOXC13, and HOXD12). Conversely, activated\nmonocytic and B-lymphocyte cells show a large increase in\nexpression of the same genes. Given the key regulatory\nroles of HOX genes it is likely that these changes in\nexpression facilitate the cellular changes associated with\nactivation. One of these is increased proliferation, a\nresponse that is known to be mediated by HOX genes in a\nnumber of hematopoietic lineages (reviewed by [1]).\nIndeed the antisense mediated ablation of HOXB2 or\nHOXB4 in T-lymphocytes was previously shown to block\nthe proliferation of activated cells (Care et al. 1995). Fur-\nthermore HOXA10 deficiency causes a severe\nimmunological disturbance in uterine tissues characterised\nby rapid T cell proliferation and a failure of progesterone-\nmediated immunosuppression [17]. The HOX genes are\nalso likely to regulate lineage-specific transcription upon\nFig. 2 continued\n248 R. Morgan, K. Whiting\n123\nactivation, and in this context the contrasting expression\nlevels of these genes presumably reflect the dramatically\ndifferent response of each cell type.\n2 Materials and methods\nCD4+, CD8+, CD14+ and CD19+ cells were isolated using\nthe Dynabead system (Invitrogen) and cultured as previ-\nously described [2]. Quantitative PCR was performed as\npreviously described [11]. [3H]thymidine incorporation\nwas evaluated by a standard procedure. Briefly, 2 lCi of\n[3H]thymidine (20 Ci\/mmol) was added for 4 h to each\nwell. Cells were then recovered, washed, and processed for\nthe determination of TCA precipitable radioactivity. Each\nevaluation was performed in triplicate. T cell activation\nwas achieved using anti-CD2, anti-CD3 and anti-CD28\nantibodies as supplied in the T cell activation\/expansion kit\n(Miltenyi Biotec).\nReferences\n1. Abramovich C, Humphries RK.
