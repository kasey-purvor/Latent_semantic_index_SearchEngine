The\nmain application given here is existence and uniqueness for the Attal\u2013Meyer\nequations for implicit definition of quantum stochastic integrals.\n0. Introduction. Quantum stochastic calculus is now a well-established\nnoncommutative extension of classical It\u00f4 calculus [10, 32, 37]. There are other\nsuch extensions, notably It\u00f4\u2013Clifford theory [7, 40], fermionic [1] and quasi-free\n[8, 26] stochastic calculi and the calculus based on free independence [11, 25].\nHowever, to date, the most developed [2, 5, 9, 16, 17, 19, 22, 27, 29, 30, 34,\n33, 38, 43] is the bosonic theory originated by Hudson and Parthasarathy [23].\nMoreover, fermionic theory has been incorporated into the bosonic by means of a\ncontinuous Jordan\u2013Wigner transformation which has a simple quantum stochastic\ndescription [24].\nAs originally set down the homogeneity of exponential vectors with respect to\nthe continuous tensor product structure of (symmetric) Fock space was key to the\ndevelopment of the calculus. Quantum stochastic (QS) integrals were constructed\nfor time-indexed families of operators which are defined on exponential vectors\nand satisfy an adaptedness property which is itself nicely described in terms of\nthese vectors. The QS integrals were thereby defined on such exponential domains,\ntoo. Their composition as operators is thus inadmissible, strictly speaking, within\nthis exponential vector formulation, since they typically do not leave the linear\nReceived April 2000; revised February 2003.\n1Supported by EU Human Capital and Mobility Network Quantum Probability and Applications.\nAMS 2000 subject classification. 81S25.\nKey words and phrases.

Only inner products of QS integrals acting\non such vectors may be formed. Perhaps, surprisingly, this limitation has not been\nfelt until recently\u2014a rich stock of QS processes has been constructed through an\neffective theory of QS differential equations. This limitation does make itself felt\nwhen one is interested in algebraic questions such as the structure of the collection\nof bounded operator-valued quantum semimartingales [2].\nOne way in which QS calculus has been extended beyond exponential domains\nis by means of the Hitsuda\u2013Skorohod integral of anticipative processes [21, 41]\nand the related gradient operator of Malliavin calculus [18, 35]. In this noncausal\nformulation [9, 27] the action of each QS integral is defined explicitly on Fock\nspace vectors, and the essential quantum It\u00f4 formula (in inner product form) is seen\nin terms of the Skorohod isometry. Neither exponential domains nor adaptedness\nof the operator-valued integrands are required. Set against these advantages, the\ndomains of both the annihilation and number integrals in this approach are still\nrestricted\u2014this time to parts of the domain of the square root of the number\noperator\u2014even when the resulting operator is bounded. This domain limitation\nagain artificially limits operator composition.\nA second way in which the scope and domain of QS calculus has been extended\nis by means of an abstract It\u00f4 calculus on Fock space [5]. Specifically, in this\napproach the fact that all vectors of the Fock space admit an abstract predictable\nrepresentation, f = E[f ] + \u222b\u221e0 \u03bes(f ) d\u03c7s , is exploited to obtain a formula for\nthe action of QS integrals which makes good sense for nonexponential vectors.\nFor example, if Xt is the creation integral\n\u222b t\n0 Hs dA\n\u2020\ns and ft =\n\u222b t\n0 \u03bes(f ) d\u03c7s ,\nthen Xtft = \u222b t0 (Xs\u03bes(f ) + Hsfs) d\u03c7s . This leads to a definition of QS integrals\nwhich agrees with the original one when restricted to exponential vectors.\nIn this It\u00f4 calculus formulation operator composition of QS integrals is admitted.\nUnder some conditions the domain of these QS integrals may be the whole of\nFock space\u2014a fact which plays an important role in the theory of quantum\nsemimartingale algebras and the theory of quantum square and angle brackets\n[2, 43]. The main disadvantage of this formulation is that the QS integrals are only\ndefined implicitly. In fact, the definitions amount to a system of abstract stochastic\ndifferential equations and, up to now, the general existence and uniqueness of\nsolutions for these equations were not known. Moreover, the maximal operator\ndomains of these QS integrals have been far from clear.\nThe purpose of this work is to unify and extend both of the above approaches.\nWe give definitions which provide the action of QS integrals explicitly; introduce\nno unnatural domain limitations; settle the existence and uniqueness question for\nthe systems of stochastic differential equations arising in the It\u00f4 calculus approach;\nand permit operator composition of QS integrals, governed by a quantum It\u00f4\nproduct formula. Moreover, we demonstrate maximality of operator domains for\nthese QS integrals.\nThe main idea is to base the calculus on a finely tuned definition of operator\nadaptedness, exploiting an adapted gradient operator inspired by classical\n490 S. ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\nstochastic analysis. On exponential vectors the usual definition is recovered;\nhowever, the new definition frees us from any prescribed domains and imposes no\nextraneous domain constraints. For example, the domain of a t-adapted operator\ncan now be all of Fock space when it is bounded and need no longer be an algebraic\ntensor product when it is unbounded. The new definition provides a clearer picture\nof the relationship between quantum and classical It\u00f4 calculus; it also leads to a\ndefinition of conditional expectation for Fock space operators which enjoys all the\nalgebraic properties one could hope for, given the vagaries of unbounded operators.\nThe refinement of operator adaptedness is also the point of departure for the new\ndefinitions of QS integrals given here. In particular, the gradient operator, used in\nthe noncausal formulation of QS calculus, is replaced by the adapted gradient. This\novercomes the unnatural domain constraint imposed in the noncausal approach\nwhile maintaining explicitness of the action of QS integrals. The connection with\nthe It\u00f4 calculus approach is then seen through commutation relations between the\nSkorohod and time integrals and the adapted gradient operator, and a recursion\nformula enjoyed by the QS integrals.\nA brief preliminary account of this work has appeared in [4].\n1. Notation and conventions. The collection of subsets of R+ having finite\ncardinality:\n{\u03c3 \u2282 R+ : #\u03c3 <\u221e}\nwill be referred to as the finite power set of R+ and denoted \u0004, with \u0004(n) denoting\nthe collection of n-element subsets. For n \u2265 1, Lebesgue measure induces a mea-\nsure on \u0004(n) through the bijection s \u0004\u2192 {s1, . . . , sn} from {s \u2208 Rn+ : s1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < sn}\nto \u0004(n). By letting \u2205 \u2208 \u0004(0) be an atom of measure 1, we arrive at a \u03c3 -finite\nmeasure on\n\u22c3\nn\u22650 \u0004(n) = \u0004 called the symmetric measure of Lebesgue measure\non R+ [20].\nMeasurable for Hilbert space\u2013valued maps means here strongly measurable,\nand integrable means Bochner integrable; since all Hilbert spaces appearing will\nbe separable, weak measurability implies measurability [14]. Fixing a complex\nseparable Hilbert space h, Guichardet\u2013Fock space (or simply Fock space) is the\nHilbert space tensor product h \u2297 L2(\u0004), which we identify with the space of\n(classes of ) square-integrable functions L2(\u0004;h), and is denoted F . Elements\nof \u0004 will always be denoted by lowercase Greek letters such as \u03b1, \u03b2 , \u03c3 , \u03c4 and \u03c9,\nand these will be used exclusively for this purpose. With this convention we write\nsimply\n\u222b\nf (\u03c3 ) d\u03c3 to denote the integral of a Hilbert space\u2013valued function f\nover \u0004 with respect to the symmetric measure of Lebesgue measure on R+.\nSimilarly,\n\u222b\n\u03d5(s) ds will always denote the integral of a function \u03d5 over R+ with\nrespect to Lebesgue measure. The following elementary identity is fundamental\u2014\na proof may be found in [28].\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 491\nLEMMA 1.1 (Integral\u2013sum lemma). Let g be a nonnegative measurable\nfunction \u0004 \u00d7 \u0004 \u2192 R (or a Bochner-integrable function \u0004 \u00d7 \u0004 \u2192 h) and let G be\nthe function defined by G(\u03c3) = \u2211\u03b1\u2282\u03c3 g(\u03b1,\u03c3 \\ \u03b1). Then G is nonnegative and\nmeasurable (resp. integrable) and\u222b\nG(\u03c3)d\u03c3 =\n\u222b \u222b\ng(\u03b1,\u03b2) d\u03b1 d\u03b2.\nThe following subspaces of Guichardet\u2013Fock space are useful:\nK(a) := DomaN, K := \u22c2\na\u22651\nK(a),(1.1a)\nFfin :=\n{\nf \u2208 F : suppf \u2282 \u22c3\nn\u2264m\n\u0004(n) for some m\n}\n,(1.1b)\nE(S) := Lin{\u03b5(\u03d5) :\u03d5 \u2208 S},(1.1c)\nwhere S is a subset of L2(R+). Here Dom denotes the domain of a Hilbert\nspace operator; N is the number operator, Nf (\u03c3) = #\u03c3f (\u03c3 ), with maximal\ndomain; and aN is defined through the functional calculus. Also, \u03b5(\u03d5) denotes\nthe exponential vector of the test function \u03d5 [37] which in Guichardet\u2013Fock space\nis the measure equivalence class of the function\n\u03c3 \u0004\u2192 \u220f\ns\u2208\u03c3\n\u03d5(s).\nFollowing is a list of set-theoretic notation and measure-theoretic conventions\nthat we shall adopt throughout.

ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\nextends uniquely to an isometric isomorphism Fs \u2297 F s \u2192 F . This structure is\nelegantly carried by the exponential vectors, being determined by the following\nrestriction of (1.2):\nv\u03b5\n(\n\u03d5[0,s[\n)\u2297 \u03b5(\u03d5[s,\u221e[) \u0004\u2192 v\u03b5(\u03d5),\nwhere, under the natural isometry Fs \u2192 Fs \u2297 F s given by f \u0004\u2192 f \u2297 \u03b4\u2205,\nwith \u03b4\u2205 := \u03b5(0), Fs is first viewed as a subspace of F . The notation here is\n\u03d5[a,b[ := \u03d51[a,b[, and 1 denotes the indicator function.\nAn important consequence of the integral\u2013sum lemma is the following identity:\u222b \u222b\nf (\u03c3 \u222a t) d\u03c3 dt =\n\u222b\n#\u03c9f (\u03c9)d\u03c9,(1.3)\nwhich is valid for nonnegative measurable functions \u0004 \u2192 R and for measurable\nfunctions \u0004 \u2192 h for which either\/both sides are defined.\nWe use the following notation for algebraic tensor products: for subspaces\nU and V of Hilbert spaces H and K, U \u000e V \u2282 H \u2297 K is the subspace\nLin{u\u2297 v :u \u2208 U,v \u2208 V }, and for operators R on H and S on K, R \u000e S denotes\nthe operator on H \u2297 K with domain DomR \u000e DomS satisfying (R \u000e S)(x \u2297 y) =\nRx \u2297 Sy. Finally, a pair of Hilbert space operators satisfying\n\u3008Ru,v\u3009 = \u3008u,Sv\u3009, u \u2208 DomR, v \u2208 DomS,(1.4)\nwill be called an adjoint pair. When DomR is dense this amounts to the\ncondition R\u2217 \u2283 S.\n2. It\u00f4 calculus in Fock space. Our aim in this section is twofold. First, we\nconstruct part of the It\u00f4 calculus on Fock space, describing familiar probabilistic\nconcepts in this unfamiliar language while emphasizing the universality of Fock\nspace. Second, we develop relationships between the components of this calculus\n(derivative, projection and integrals). These will be applied later, once we have\nintroduced noncommuative processes. The section ends with a discussion of the\nconnection with classical It\u00f4 calculus through probabilistic interpretations of the\nobjects introduced.\n2.1. Integration. The measurable structure on \u0004 \u00d7 R+ is the completed\nproduct measure of the Guichardet measure on \u0004 and the Lebesgue measure\non R+. We need a spectrum of integrability conditions for a Hilbert space\u2013valued\nmap x :\u0004 \u00d7 R+ \u2192 h. We write xs(\u03c9) for x(\u03c9, s). Then:\n\u2022 x is time integrable if, for a.a. \u03c9, the map x\u00b7(\u03c9) is integrable R+ \u2192 h and the\nfollowing a.e. defined map is square integrable:\nL(x) :\u03c9 \u2192\n\u222b\nxs(\u03c9)ds.\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 493\n\u2022 x is absolutely time integrable if x is measurable and the map (\u03c9, s) \u2192 \u2016xs(\u03c9)\u2016\nis time integrable.\n\u2022 x is Bochner integrable if, for a.a. s, the map xs is square integrable \u0004 \u2192 h and\ns \u0004\u2192 [xs] is integrable R+ \u2192F .\n\u2022 x is Skorohod integrable if the following map is square integrable \u0004 \u2192 h:\nS(x) : \u03c3 \u0004\u2192\u2211\ns\u2208\u03c3\nxs(\u03c3 \\ s).\n\u2022 x belongs to DomS if x is square integable \u0004 \u00d7 R+ \u2192 h and x is Skorohod\nintegrable.\n\u2022 x is absolutely Skorohod integrable if x is measurable and the map (\u03c9, s) \u0004\u2192\n\u2016xs(\u03c9)\u2016 is Skorohod integrable.\nL(x) and S(x) are called the time integral of x and the Skorohod integral of x,\nrespectively. We emphasize here that, for the definitions of both time integrability\nand Skorohod integrability, we assume neither the square integrability of each xs\nnor the (joint) measurability of x. Note, however, that if x and x\u2032 are maps\n\u0004\u00d7R+ \u2192 h which agree a.e., then x\u2032 is time integrable if and only if x is, in which\ncase L(x\u2032) = L(x), and similarly for the Skorohod integral. Therefore, although\nL(x) and S(x) are defined pointwise, we view both L and S as mappings from\nmeasure equivalence classes into F . The definition of Bochner integrability is the\nstandard one, rephrased here for easy comparison with the pointwise integrability\nconditions. The space DomS is merely the domain of the Skorohod integral when\nit is viewed as an unbounded Hilbert space operator L2(\u0004 \u00d7 R+;h)\u2192F .\nPROPOSITION 2.1.

(ai) follows from the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz in-\nequality in L2(R+). If x is Bochner integrable, then, by standard vector integra-\ntion theory [14], it is jointly measurable. Moreover, by a continuous version of\nMinkowski\u2019s inequality [42],{\u222b [\u222b\n\u2016x(\u03c9, s)\u2016ds\n]2\nd\u03c9\n}1\/2\n\u2264\n\u222b {\u222b\n\u2016x(\u03c9, s)\u20162 d\u03c9\n}1\/2\nds =\n\u222b\n\u2016xs\u2016ds,\nwhich establishes (aii). (bi)\u2013(biii) follow from straightforward applications of the\nintegral\u2013sum lemma\u2014see [27] for further details. \u0001\nLet x be a map \u0004 \u00d7 R+ \u2192 h. Then x is adapted if\nxs(\u03c9) = 0 for \u03c9 \u0016\u2282 \u0004s,(2.2)\nand x is It\u00f4 integrable if x is adapted and the map\nI(x) :\u0004 \u2192 h, \u03c3 \u0004\u2192\n{0, if \u03c3 = \u2205,\nx\u2228\u03c3 (\u03c3_ ), otherwise,\nis square integrable. Note I(x) is that called the It\u00f4 integral of x. Like L(x)\nand S(x), it will be viewed as an element of F . As with time and Skorohod\nintegrals, It\u00f4 integrability depends only on the measure equivalence class of x,\nand the It\u00f4 integral lifts to a mapping from measure equivalence classes into F .\nIn contrast to time integrals and Skorohod integrals, It\u00f4-integrable maps are\nnecessarily measurable.\nA Fock vector process is a family x = (xs)s\u22650 in F . It is adapted if xs \u2208 Fs\nfor each s, and measurable if the map s \u0004\u2192 xs is measurable R+ \u2192 F . For a\nmeasurable vector process x, there is a measurable map x\u02dc :\u0004 \u00d7 R+ \u2192 h such\nthat x\u02dcs(\u00b7) is a version of xs for each s. If x is adapted, then x\u02dc may be chosen to be\nadapted in the sense of (2.2). The measure equivalence class of x\u02dc is unique, and\nwe shall therefore abuse notation by using x for the map as well as for the process.\nUsing the integral\u2013sum lemma, the following is a straightforward consequence\nof our definitions.\nPROPOSITION 2.2. Let x be an adapted map \u0004\u00d7R+ \u2192 h. Then the following\nare equivalent:\n(a) x is It\u00f4 integrable;\n(b) x is Skorohod integrable;\n(c) x is square integrable.\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 495\nMoreover, in any of these cases we have I(x) = S(x) and\n\u2016I(x)\u20162 =\n\u222b\n\u2016xs\u20162 ds.(2.3)\nWe shall refer to identity (2.3) as It\u00f4 isometry. Comparison with (2.1) shows that\nSkorohod isometry extends It\u00f4 isometry beyond adapted maps. Another way of\nexpressing It\u00f4 integrability is in terms of the set\n\u0004ad := {(\u03c9, s) \u2208 \u0004 \u00d7 R+ :\u03c9 < s}.\nThe collection of equivalence classes of It\u00f4-integrable maps may be identified\nwith L2(\u0004ad;h). The adapted projection on L2(\u0004 \u00d7 R+;h) is the orthogonal\nprojection onto the closed subspace L2(\u0004ad;h):\nPadx : (\u03c9, s) \u0004\u2192 1{\u03c9<s}xs(\u03c9).\nIn the discussion of the It\u00f4 calculus approach to QS calculus, we shall use the\nnotation\n\u222b\u221e\n0 xs d\u03c7s for I(x), in recognition of the fact that it may be viewed as an\nintegral in F with respect to the continuous path (\u03c7s)s\u22650, where \u03c7s is (the measure\nequivalence class of ) the indicator function of \u0004(1)s [3].\nLetting R stand for any of the integrals L,S or I, we write for a \u2264 b \u2208 [0,\u221e],\nRba(x) =R\n(\n1[a,b[(\u00b7)x\u00b7).\nNote that the Skorohod integrability of 1[a,b[(\u00b7)x\u00b7 is not implied by the Skorohod\nintegrability of x and the same goes for time integrability. This is an essential\nfeature of these integrals [6].\n2.2. Differentiation and projection. For a vector space\u2013valued map f :\u0004 \u2192 V,\nlet \u2207f and Df be the maps \u0004 \u00d7 R+ \u2192 V given by\n\u2207f (\u03c9, s) = f (\u03c9 \u222a s), Df (\u03c9, s)= 1{\u03c9<s}f (\u03c9 \u222a s).\nThe operators \u2207 and D commute with the norm in h in the sense that if\nk = \u2016f (\u00b7)\u2016h where f :\u0004 \u2192 h, then \u2207k(\u03c9, s) = \u2016\u2207f (\u03c9, s)\u2016, and likewise for D.\nStraightforward application of the integral\u2013sum lemma [cf. (1.3)] gives the\nfollowing result.\nPROPOSITION 2.3. Let f :\u0004 \u2192 h be measurable. Then \u2207f and Df are\nmeasurable and satisfy\u222b \u222b\n\u2016\u2207f (\u03c9, s)\u20162 d\u03c9 ds =\n\u222b\n#\u03c3\u2016f (\u03c3 )\u20162 d\u03c3,(2.4a) \u222b \u222b\n\u2016Df (\u03c9, s)\u20162 d\u03c9 ds =\n\u222b\n\u2016f (\u03c3 )\u20162 d\u03c3 \u2212 \u2016f (\u2205)\u20162.(2.4b)\n496 S. ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\nIt follows that we may view \u2207 and D as (measure equivalence) class mappings.\nWhen f \u2208 F , we call \u2207f and Df the stochastic gradient of f and the adapted\ngradient of f , respectively. Moreover, we write Dom\u2207 for the domain of the\nstochastic gradient viewed as an unbounded Hilbert space operator (cf. DomS):\nDom\u2207 := {f \u2208 F :\u2207f \u2208L2(\u0004 \u00d7 R+;h)}.\nFor \u03c3 \u2208 \u0004, s \u2208 R+ and a vector space\u2013valued map f :\u0004 \u2192 V , let \u2207\u03c3 f , D\u03c3f\nand Psf be the maps \u0004 \u2192 V given by\n\u2207\u03c3 f (\u03c9) = f (\u03c9 \u222a \u03c3), D\u03c3f (\u03c9) = 1{\u03c9<\u03c3 }f (\u03c9 \u222a \u03c3), Psf = 1\u0004sf.\nThus, writing Dsf for D{s}f , we have\nDsf =Df (\u00b7, s), D\u2205f = f\nand\nD\u03c3f = Ds1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Dsnf if \u03c3 = {s1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7< sn}.\nThe following algebraic relations are evident for s < t :\nP0f = f (\u2205)\u03b4\u2205, PsPtf = PtPsf = Psf,(2.5a)\nDtDsf = DtPsf = 0,(2.5b)\nDsPtf = PtDsf =Dsf,(2.5c)\nas is the reproducing relation D\u03c4f (\u03c3 )= f (\u03c3 \u222a \u03c4 ) for \u03c3 < \u03c4 , with special cases:\nf (\u03c9) = (D\u03c9f )(\u2205) =D\u2228\u03c9f (\u03c9_ ) if \u03c9 \u0016= \u2205.(2.5d)\n2.3. Integro-differential and adjoint relations. First, we relate Skorohod\nintegration with stochastic differentiation and give the adapted counterpart.\nPROPOSITION 2.4. Let f \u2208 F and let x :\u0004 \u00d7 R+ \u2192 h be Skorohod\nintegrable:\n(a) If the map (\u03c9, s) \u0004\u2192 \u3008xs(\u03c9), f (\u03c9 \u222a s)\u3009 is integrable, then\n\u3008S(x), f \u3009 =\n\u222b \u222b\n\u3008xs(\u03c9),\u2207sf (\u03c9)\u3009d\u03c9 ds.\n(b) If x is It\u00f4 integrable, then\n\u3008I(x), f \u3009 =\n\u222b\n\u3008xs,Dsf \u3009ds.\nPROOF. More straightforward applications of the integral\u2013sum lemma. \u0001\nNext, we summarize the Hilbert space properties of the stochastic and adapted\ngradients and the Skorohod and It\u00f4 integrals.

Almost everywhere defined operators. Our philosophy in this paper is to\ntreat the maps Ds like operators on F , exploiting the fact that D is a bounded\noperator on F so that, unlike \u2207 , it is defined on the whole of F . With each\nf \u2208 F ,Dsf is a well-defined element of F for almost every s. Of course, the\nnull set depends on f , and for this reason Ds is not an operator on F in the usual\nsense\u2014we shall speak of almost everywhere defined operators on F . We take\nthis viewpoint in order to exploit the relations (2.5a\u2013d). On measure equivalence\nclasses of maps such as elements of F , these translate to the a.e. relations and the\na.e. reproducing property\nDtDsf = DtPsf = 0, DsPtf = PtDsf =Dsf for a.a.

Probabilistic interpretations. In this section we describe explicitly the\nconnection between the objects we have introduced in Fock space (Pad,D,\u2207,S, I)\nand their classical probabilistic counterparts. While formally independent of the\nrest of the paper, the ideas here underlie the whole work.\nA probabilistic interpretation of Fock space is provided by a quintuple of\nthe form (\f,F, (Ft )t\u22650,P,m) in which (\f,F, (Ft )t\u22650,P) is the canonical fil-\ntered space of m = (mt )t\u22650 and m is a normal martingale\u2014that is, a mar-\ntingale for which (m2t \u2212 t)t\u22650 is also a martingale\u2014which has the chaotic\nrepresentation property. Examples of such martingales include Brownian motion,\nthe compensated Poisson process and some of the Azema martingales [15]. The\nchaotic representation of random variables leads to a natural isomorphism \r\nbetween F and X :=L2(\f,F,P;h), which may suggestively be expressed as\nf \u0004\u2192 \u222b f (\u03c3 ) dm\u03c3 [31]. Each of the operations Pt , Dt , \u2207t , S, I and L has inter-\npretations on X as well-known probabilistic operations. For this point of view in\nthe Poisson case, see [36].\n500 S. ATTAL AND J.

In particular, a square-integrable classical stochastic\nprocess in X is adapted if and only if its image under \r\u22121 is adapted in the sense of\nSection 2.1. Since the martingale m has the chaotic representation property, it also\npossesses the predictable representation property. Any random variable f in X\nmay therefore be expressed as f = E[f ] + \u222b\u221e0 \u03bet (f ) dmt for some predictable\nprocess (\u03bet (f ))t\u22650 in X. Viewing (\u03bet )t\u22650 as a family of a.e. defined operators\non X, we see it as a probabilistic interpretation of (Dt )t\u22650 :Dt = \r\u22121 \u25e6 \u03bet \u25e6 \r .\nSimilarly, \u2207 corresponds precisely to the gradient operator in Malliavin calculus,\nand \u2207t corresponds to the stochastic derivative, along the element \u03c7 : s \u0004\u2192 s \u2227 t of\nthe Cameron\u2013Martin space, on X [35]. By Theorem 2.5(b) S is the adjoint of \u2207\nand therefore [18] corresponds to the Hitsuda\u2013Skorohod integral with respect to\nthe process m. It also follows from Theorem 2.5(e) that I, being the restriction of S\nto adapted Fock vector processes, corresponds to the It\u00f4 integral with respect to m.\nTheorem 2.5(d) includes an expression of the predictable respresentation property\nof m, and the isometry of It\u00f4 integration with respect to m, on F . Finally, 2.5(f )\nimplies that Dt = Pt\u2207t (in the sense of a.e. defined operators), which corresponds\nto Clark\u2019s formula [12, 13].\nThus, each of the operations introduced in Sections 2.1\u20132.4 corresponds to well-\nknown operations of classical stochastic analysis once Fock space is interpreted\nas the chaotic space of some normal martingale. In fact, one should rather think\nthe other way around. Probabilistic operations such as Skorohod integration,\nstochastic differentiation, predictable representation and so on may be expressed\nmerely in terms of the chaotic expansion of random variables. They use no\nspecific property of the particular martingale beyond chaotic representation and\nthe form of It\u00f4 isometry. The normality of the martingale implies that its angle\nbracket \u3008m,m\u3009t equals t , and so the fomula for It\u00f4 isometry remains the same\nfor each such martingale. Fock space is thereby seen as an abstract chaos space\nwhich encodes the chaotic representation property and the It\u00f4 isometry formula of\nnormal martingales and which carries simple intrinsic operations which perform\nthe L2-stochastic calculus of the martingale.\n3. Operator adaptedness. In this section three natural candidates for time-s-\nadaptedness for a (possibly unbounded) Fock space operator are shown to\nbe equivalent, and, using the a.e. reproducing property, a very useful further\nequivalent condition is found. We take these as our definition and verify that they\ngeneralize the obvious definition on exponential domains. Under the new definition\ncomposition of time-s-adapted operators yields a time-s-adapted operator. We note\nthat all domains previously used in QS calculus are adapted subspaces in the sense\ndefined below. Recall the a.e. reproducing relation (2.6b).\n3.1. Definitions and basic properties. A subspace V of F is called s-adapted\nif, for any f in V :\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 501\n(i) Psf \u2208 V ;\n(ii) Dtf \u2208 V for a.a. t > s.\nClearly, any intersection of s-adapted subspaces is s-adapted. A subspace V of F\nis called adapted if it is s-adapted for every s; these will be referred to as Fock-\nadapted spaces.\nIn the proof of the following result, repeated use is made of the a.e.\nrelations (2.6a, b), as well as the identity\n(Pt \u2212 Ps)f = Its (D\u00b7f ), s < t \u2264 \u221e,\nin which P\u221e is the identity operator.\nTHEOREM 3.1. Let C be an operator on F with s-adapted domain D . Then\nthe following are equivalent:\n(a) For all f \u2208D , (i) PsCf = PsCPsf and (ii) DtCf =CDtf for a.a. t \u2265 s.\n(b) For all f \u2208 D , (i) CPsf = PsCPsf and (ii) CDtf \u2208 Ft for a.a. t \u2265 s,\n(CDtf )t\u2265s defines an It\u00f4-integrable process and\nC(f \u2212 Psf ) = I\u221es (CD\u00b7f ).(3.1)\n(c) For all f \u2208D , (i) PsCf = CPsf and (ii) DtCf = CDtf for a.a. t > s.\n(d) For all f \u2208D ,\nCf (\u03c9)= (CPsD\u03c9(s f )(\u03c9s)) for a.a. \u03c9.\nPROOF. Obviously, (c) \u21d2 (a) and (a) + (b) \u21d2 (c). It therefore suffices to\nestablish (a) \u21d4 (b) and (c) \u21d4 (d). Suppose that (a) holds and let f \u2208 D . Then,\nby (aii), CDtf \u2208Ft for a.a. t > s and (CDtf )t\u2265s is It\u00f4 integrable with\nI\u221es (CD\u00b7f ) = I\u221es (D\u00b7Cf ) = Cf \u2212 PsCf.(3.2)\nApplying this identity to Psf gives\n0 =CPsf \u2212 PsCPsf,\nand so (bi) holds and also, by (ai), PsCf = CPsf . Putting this back into (3.2)\ngives (bii); hence, (b) holds.\nSuppose that (b) holds and let f \u2208 D . Then, applying (bii) then (bi), for\na.a. t > s,\nDtCf =DtCPsf +DtI\u221es (CD\u00b7f ) =DtPsCPsf +CDtf = CDtf,\nso (aii) holds. Applying (3.1),\nPsCP\n\u22a5\ns f = PsI\u221es (CD\u00b7f ) = 0,\nsince I\u221es (CD\u00b7f ) is orthogonal to Fs , so (ai) holds, too.\n502 S. ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\nSuppose that (c) holds and let f \u2208D . Then iterating (cii) shows that PsD\u03b2Cf =\nCPsD\u03b2f for a.a. \u03b2 > s. Therefore, using the a.e. reproducing property,\nCf (\u03c9) = (PsD\u03c9(sCf )(\u03c9s)) = (CPsD\u03c9(s f )(\u03c9s))\nfor a.a. \u03c9, so (d) holds.\nSuppose, finally, that (d) holds and let f \u2208 D . Then, applying (d) first to Psf\nand last to f ,\nCPsf (\u03c9) = (CPsD\u03c9(sPsf )(\u03c9s)) = 1{\u03c9<s}(CPsf )(\u03c9s))\n= 1{\u03c9<s}(CPsf )(\u03c9) = 1{\u03c9<s}(Cf )(\u03c9) = PsCf (\u03c9)\nfor a.a. \u03c9, so CPsf = PsCf . Also, applying (d) to f and then to Dtf ,\n(DtCf )(\u03c9) = 1{\u03c9<t}Cf (\u03c9 \u222a t) = 1{\u03c9<t}(CPsD\u03c9(sDtf )(\u03c9s))\n= (CPsD\u03c9(sDtf )(\u03c9s)) = (CDtf )(\u03c9)\nfor a.a. (\u03c9, t) with t > s, so DtCf =CDtf for a.a. t > s. Hence, (c) holds. \u0001\nAn operator C on F is called s-adapted if it has an s-adapted domain on which\nit satisfies any\/all of the equivalent conditions of the above theorem. We call (a),\n(b), (c) and (d), respectively, the differential, integral, commuting and projective\ndefinitions of adaptedness.\nREMARKS. (o) Notice how the projective definition builds on the a.e.\nreproducing relation (2.6b).\n(i) If g \u2208 Fs , h \u2208 F s and t > s, then Ps(g \u2297 h) = h(\u2205)g \u2297 \u03b4\u2205 and Dt(g \u2297\nh) = g \u2297 Dth. It follows that, for any operator C\u02dc on Fs with domain V\u02dc , the\noperator C\u02dc \u000e I (having domain V\u02dc \u000eF s) is s-adapted.\n(ii) From the projective definition of adaptedness, one sees that an s-adapted\noperator satisfies\nCPtf = PtCf for t > s and f \u2208 DomC \u2229 Dom(CPt ),\nand so is t-adapted, provided only that DomC is t-adapted.\n(iii) Also, from the projective definition, it follows that if s-adapted operators\nC and C\u2032 agree on Fs \u2229 DomC \u2229 DomC\u2032, then they agree on their common\ndomain DomC \u2229 DomC\u2032.\n(iv) Given an operator C\u02dc on Fs with domain Fs \u2229 V , where V is an s-adapted\nsubspace, Cf (\u03c4) = (C\u02dcPsD\u03c4(s f )(\u03c4s)) defines an s-adapted operator C on V\nextending C\u02dc, called the s-adapated extension of C\u02dc to V .\nThe following property of s-adapted operators follows easily from the a.e.\nreproducing property and the integral\u2013sum lemma.\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 503\nPROPOSITION 3.2. Let C be an s-adapted operator on F . Then, for all\nf \u2208F and g \u2208 DomC,\n\u3008f,Cg\u3009 =\n\u222b\n{\u03b2>s}\n\u3008PsD\u03b2f,CPsD\u03b2g\u3009d\u03b2.\nLet As denote the collection of s-adapted operators on F .\nPROPOSITION 3.3. As is closed under operator products, sums and scalar\nmultiples.\nPROOF. Let C and C\u2032 be s-adapted operators on F and let f \u2208 Dom(CC\u2032).\nThen Psf and Dtf lie in Dom(C\u2032), C\u2032Psf = PsC\u2032f and C\u2032Dtf = DtC\u2032f for\na.a. t > s, since f \u2208 Dom(C\u2032) and C\u2032 is s-adapted. But C\u2032f \u2208 DomC and\nC is s-adapted, so PsC\u2032f and DtC\u2032f lie in DomC, C(PsC\u2032f ) = PsCC\u2032f and\nC(DtC\n\u2032f ) = DtCC\u2032f for a.a. t > s. This shows that As is closed under operator\nmultiplication. Since an intersection of s-adapted subspaces is s-adapted, As is\nalso closed under addition. It is obviously closed under scalar multiplication. \u0001\nAs fails to be an associative algebra in the same sense in which the collection\nof all unbounded operators on F does; namely, an element C whose domain is not\nall of F fails to have an additive inverse, and scalar multiplication by 0 yields not\nthe zero operator, but its restriction to DomC.\nThe adjoint of a densely defined s-adapted operator C may fail to be s-adapted\nas it stands. However, we shall see in the next section (Corollary 4.4) that\nconditioning an operator which is adjoint to C yields an s-adapted operator adjoint\nto C.\nThe next result addresses the question of when an s-adapted operator can pass\nunder an It\u00f4 integral.\nPROPOSITION 3.4. Let C be an s-adapted operator and let x : [a, b[\u2192 F\nbe an It\u00f4-integrable DomC-valued vector process, where s \u2264 a < b \u2264 \u221e.\nIf Iba(x) \u2208 DomC, then the adapted Fock vector process 1[a,b[(\u00b7)Cx\u00b7 is also It\u00f4\nintegrable, and\nIba(Cx\u00b7) =CIba(x).(3.3)\nPROOF. Set g = Iba(x). Then Dtg = xt for a.a. t \u2208 [a, b[ and, by the\ns-adaptedness of C,\nCxt =CDtg = DtCg for a.a. t \u2208 [a, b[.\nHence, 1[a,b[(\u00b7)Cx\u00b7 is It\u00f4 integrable and\nIba(Cx\u00b7) = Iba(D\u00b7Cg) = (Pb \u2212Pa)Cg =C(Pb \u2212 Pa)g.\n504 S. ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\nSince Pbg = g and Pag = 0, (3.3) follows. \u0001\nWe shall see later [Proposition 4.1(v)] that the condition Iba(x) \u2208 DomC is\nautomatically satisfied for s-adapted operators which have their natural s-adapted\ndomains.\n3.2. Examples and comparisons. Recall that in the original (exponential\nvector) formulation of QS calculus, all processes are defined on a domain of the\nform V0 \u000e E(S), where V0 is a dense subspace of h and S is an admissible subset\nof L2(R+), that is, a subset for which E(S) is dense in \u0004(L2(R+)) and \u03d5[0,s[ \u2208 S\nwhenever \u03d5 \u2208 S and s \u2265 0 [23]. Since, for all s and a.a. t ,\nPsv\u03b5(\u03d5) = v\u03b5(\u03d5[0,s[) and Dtv\u03b5(\u03d5) = \u03d5(t)v\u03b5(\u03d5[0,t[),(3.4)\nsuch domains are adapted in our sense. Note the a.e. identity\nD\u03c4v\u03b5(\u03d5) = v\u03b5(\u03d5[0,t[)\u03b5(\u03d5[t,\u221e[)(\u03c4 ) where t = \u2227\u03c4.\nCommonly used admissible subsets are dense subspaces of L2(R+) such as\n(L2 \u2229L\u221eloc)(R+) [23], the set {\u03d5 \u2208 (L2 \u2229L\u221e)(R+) :\u2016\u03d5\u20162 \u2264 1 and \u2016\u03d5\u2016\u221e \u2264 1} [17]\nand the set {1B :B is a finite union of bounded intervals}. The admissibility of this\nlast set was established in [39].\nPROPOSITION 3.5. Let C be an operator on F with domain of the form\nV0 \u000e E(S), where V0 is a dense subspace of h and S is admissible. Then C is\ns-adapted if and only if, for all v \u2208 V0 and \u03d5 \u2208 S:\n(i) Cv\u03b5(\u03d5[0,s[) \u2208Fs ;\n(ii) Cv\u03b5(\u03d5) =Cv\u03b5(\u03d5[0,s[)\u2297 \u03b5(\u03d5[s,\u221e[).\nPROOF. First note that if C is s-adapted, then (i) holds. Suppose therefore\nthat C satisfies (i) and let v \u2208 V0 and \u03d5 \u2208 S. Then [by (3.4)], for a.a. \u03c9 > s,\nPsD\u03c9v\u03b5(\u03d5) = v\u03b5(\u03d5[0,s[)\u03b5(\u03d5[s,\u221e[)(\u03c9) and so, for a.a. \u03c9,(\nCPsD\u03c9(s v\u03b5(\u03d5)\n)\n(\u03c9s)) = Cv\u03b5(\u03d5[0,s[)(\u03c9s))\u03b5(\u03d5[s,\u221e[)(\u03c9(s)\n= (Cv\u03b5(\u03d5[0,s[)\u2297 \u03b5(\u03d5[s,\u221e[))(\u03c9).\nAppealing to the projective definition, we see that C is s-adapted if and only if\n(ii) holds. \u0001\nThus, the new notion of adaptedness for Fock space operators extends the\noriginal definition beyond exponential domains.\nAll the domains commonly used in QS calculus are adapted. Recall the spaces\ndefined in (1.1a\u2013c).\n\u2022 F itself is obviously adapted. This is the proper domain for bounded operator-\nvalued processes.\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 505\n\u2022 Each K(a) is adapted since Ps leaves Dom(aN) invariant and \u222b \u2016aNDtf \u20162 dt =\na\u22122\u2016DaNf \u20162. Thus, K is adapted, too. This is a natural domain for both\nnoncausal QS calculus and for integral\u2013sum kernel operators on F .\n\u2022 Ffin is obviously adapted since if f \u2208 F has support in \u0004(n), then Psf and Dtf\nhave support in \u0004(n) and \u0004(n\u22121), respectively.\n\u2022 For any subspace M of L2(R+) satisfying \u03d5[0,t[ \u2208 M whenever \u03d5 \u2208 M and\nt > 0, the symmetric tensor algebra Lin{\u2297(n)\u03d5 :\u03d5 \u2208 M,n \u2265 0} is adapted since\nPs \u2297(n) \u03d5 = \u2297(n)\u03d5[0,s[ and Dt \u2297(n) \u03d5 = \u03d5(t)\u2297(n\u22121) \u03d5[0,t[.\n\u2022 The original domain used by Maassen for expressing QS integrals as integral\u2013\nsum kernel operators [30]:\n{f \u2208 F : suppf \u2282 \u0004T and \u2016f (\u03c9)\u2016 \u2264 CK#\u03c9 for some T,C and K},\nis adapted since both the support and boundedness properties are clearly\ninvariant under Ps and Dt ; for example, \u2016Dtf (\u03c9)\u2016 \u2264 C\u2032K#\u03c9, where C\u2032 =CK .\n4. Conditional expectation and operator processes. The projective defini-\ntion of s-adaptedness leads to a natural way of defining conditional expectation\nfor Fock space operators. When applied to any operator it yields an s-adapted\noperator; when applied to an operator which is already s-adapted, it yields an ex-\ntension of the operator to a natural domain for the purposes of QS calculus; and\nwhen applied to bounded operators, it gives the usual result. In this section the\nbasic classes of Fock operator processes are introduced: adapted, measurable and\ncontinuous processes, and martingales, and their stability is discussed.\n4.1. Conditioned spaces. The idea is to construct the domain of the condi-\ntioned operator so that it is maximal given the domain constraint of the uncondi-\ntioned operator. Thus, for any subspace V of F , its time-s conditioned space is\ndefined by\nDs[V ] := {f \u2208F :PsD\u03c4f \u2208 V for a.a. \u03c4 > s}.\nClearly, Ds[V ] is an s-adapted subspace. A list of additional properties enjoyed by\nthis construction follows.\nPROPOSITION 4.1. Let V and V \u2032 be subspaces of F and let s \u2265 0.\n(o) Ds[F ] =F , Ds[V \u2229 V \u2032] = Ds[V ] \u2229 Ds[V \u2032].\n(i) Ds[V ] is t-adapted for all t \u2265 s.\n(ii) If V is s-adapted, then Ds[V ] \u2283 V .\n(iii) Dt [Ds[V ]] = Ds[Dt [V ]] = Ds[V ] for all t \u2265 s.\n(iv) Ds[V ] \u2283 (V \u2229Fs)\u000eF s .\n(v) Let b > a \u2265 s and suppose that (xt )t\u2208[a,b[ is a Ds[V ]-valued It\u00f4-integrable\nvector process, then Iba(x) \u2208 Ds[V ].\n506 S. ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\nPROOF. These are routine verifications. For example, in (v), Iba(x) \u2208 Fb \u001cFa ;\nit follows that PsD\u03c4 Iba(x) = PsD\u03c4_x\u2228\u03c4 if \u03c4 \u2208 \u0004b \\ \u0004a , and is 0 otherwise. \u0001\nThus, the map Ds manufactures an s-adapted subspace from any subspace V\nwhich moreover contains V if V is already s-adapted. (iii) is a tower property of\nthe maps, and (v) is a technical property which will be useful later [in the proof of\nTheorem 4.3(v)].\n4.2. Conditioned operators. We come now to a central definition of our\napproach. Let C be an operator on F with domain V . Taking our cue from the\nprojective definition for adaptedness, we define an operator Es[C] on F by the\na.e. prescription\n(Es[C]f )(\u03c9) = (CPsD\u03c9(s f )(\u03c9s)),\nwith domain{\nf \u2208 Ds[V ] : \u03c4 \u0004\u2192 1{\u03c4>s}PsCPsD\u03c4f is square integrable \u0004 \u2192 F }.\nUsing the integral\u2013sum lemma, it is easily verified that Es[C]f \u2208 F and that the\noperator Es[C] is s-adapted. The next result therefore includes an extension of\nProposition 3.2.\nPROPOSITION 4.2. Let C be an operator on F and let s \u2265 0.\n(a) Es[C] = Es[PsCPs].\n(b) If g \u2208 DomEs[C], then PsEs[C]g = PsEs[C]Psg = PsCPsg.\n(c) If g \u2208 DomEs[C] and f \u2208 F , then\n\u3008f,Es[C]g\u3009 =\n\u222b\n{\u03b2>s}\n\u3008PsD\u03b2f,CPsD\u03b2g\u3009d\u03b2.\n(d) If (C,C\u2020) is an adjoint pair of operators on F [see (1.4)], then\n(Es[C],Es[C\u2020]) is also an adjoint pair.\n(e) If C and Es[C] are densely defined, then Es[C]\u2217 \u2283 Es[C\u2217].\nPROOF. Parts (a) and (b) are immediate consequences of the definition.\nPart (c) follows from (b) and Proposition 3.2. Part (d) follows from (c), and\n(e) from (d). \u0001\nNotice that if C is s-adapted then the subspaces Fs \u2229 DomC and\nFs \u2229 DomEs[C] coincide, and Es[C]g =Cg for g in this subspace. It follows that\nEs[C]Psf = CPsf and Es[C]Dsf =CDsf,\nwhenever Psf (resp. Dsf ) belongs to DomC. What follows is a list of the basic\nproperties of time-s conditional expectation. A refinement of (d) of the above\nproposition is included.\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 507\nTHEOREM 4.3. Let C and C\u2032 be operators on F , let \u03bb \u2208 C and let s \u2265 0.\n(o) Es[I ] = I , Es[C + \u03bbC\u2032] \u2283 Es[C] + \u03bbEs[C\u2032].\n(i) Es[C] is t-adapted for every t \u2265 s.\n(ii) C is s-adapted if and only if DomC is s-adapted and C \u2282 Es[C].\n(iii) Es[Et [C]] = Es[C] \u2282 Et [Es[C]] for all t \u2265 s.\n(iv) Es[C] \u2283 C\u02dc \u000e I , where C\u02dc = PsC|Fs\u2229DomC and I = IF s .\n(v) If C, Es[C] and Es[C]\u2217 are all densely defined, then Es[C]\u2217 is s-adapted\nand Es[C]\u2217 \u2283 Es[C\u2217].\n(vi) If C is bounded (with domain F ), then Es[C] is bounded (with\ndomain F ), too, and has norm at most \u2016C\u2016.\n(vii) If C is nonnegative, then so is Es[C].\n(viii) If S is an s-adapted operator, then Es[CS] \u2283 Es[C]S.\n(ix) If B is a bounded s-adapted operator with domain F , then\nEs[BC] \u2283 BEs[C].\n(x) If C = C1 \u000e C2, where C1 is an operator on Fs and C2 is an operator\non F s whose domain includes \u03b4\u2205, then Es[C] \u2283 \u3008\u03b4\u2205,C2\u03b4\u2205\u3009C1 \u000e IF s .\nPROOF. Most of these properties follow from straightforward applications of\nthe a.e. relations (2.6a, b), the integral\u2013sum lemma and Propositions 4.1 and 4.2 to\nthe definitions. For example, (i) follows from (i) of Proposition 4.1 and remark (ii)\nfollowing Theorem 3.1. Parts (iii) and (v) are a little more delicate.\n(iii) The inclusion follows from (i) and (ii)\u2014it is the equality that still\nneeds proof. For f \u2208 F , f belongs to DomEs[Et [C]] if and only if PsD\u03b1f \u2208\nDomEt [C] for a.a. \u03b1 > s, and the map \u03b1 \u0004\u2192 1{\u03b1>s}PsEt [C]PsD\u03b1f is square\nintegrable. By Proposition 4.2 these hold if and only if:\n(a) PtD\u03b2PsD\u03b1f \u2208 DomC for a.a. \u03b2 > t and a.a. \u03b1 > s;\n(b) \u03b2 \u0004\u2192 1{\u03b2>t}PtCPtD\u03b2PsD\u03b1f is square integrable for a.a. \u03b1 > s;\n(c) \u03b1 \u0004\u2192 1{\u03b1>s}PsCPsD\u03b1f is square integrable.\nBut since t \u2265 s, PtD\u03b2PsD\u03b1f = \u03b4\u2205(\u03b2)PsD\u03b1f for a.a. \u03b2 and (b) is vacuous, so\nf \u2208 DomEs[Et [C]] if and only if f \u2208 DomEs[C]. Moreover,\nEs\n[\nEt [C]]f (\u03c9)= (Et [C]PsD\u03c9(s )f (\u03c9s)) = (CPsD\u03c9(s )f (\u03c9s)) = Es[C]f (\u03c9)\nfor a.a. \u03c9. Hence, Es[Et [C]] = Es[C].\n(v) In view of Proposition 4.2(e), all that remains to be proved is that Es[C]\u2217 is\ns-adapted under the assumption that, along with C and Es[C], it is densely defined.\nThus, set V = DomEs[C] and V \u2217 = DomEs[C]\u2217 and let f \u2208 V \u2217 and g \u2208 V . Then,\nby Proposition 4.2(a),\n\u3008Psf,Es[C]g\u3009 = \u3008f,Es[C]Psg\u3009 = \u3008PsEs[C]\u2217f,g\u3009.\nThus, Psf \u2208 V \u2217 and Es[C]\u2217Psf = PsEs[C]\u2217f . Next, note that, for any k,h \u2208 F ,\nP\u00b7k is locally It\u00f4 integrable, and \u3008D\u00b7k,h\u3009 = \u3008D\u00b7k,P\u00b7h\u3009 is locally integrable with\n508 S. ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\u222b b\na \u3008Dtk,h\u3009dt = \u3008k, Iba(P\u00b7h)\u3009. Using this together with Propositions 3.4 and 4.1(v)\nand the fact that PtEs[C]f = Es[C]Ptf for t \u2265 s, we obtain\u222b b\ns\n\u3008Dtf,Es[C]g\u3009dt = \u3008f, Ibs (Es[C]P\u00b7g)\u3009 =\n\u222b b\ns\n\u3008DtEs[C]\u2217f,g\u3009dt\nfor b > s. Since b is arbitrary, there is a Lebesgue null set Ng of [s,\u221e[ such that\n\u3008Dtf,Es[C]g\u3009 = \u3008DtEs[C]\u2217f,g\u3009 for t \/\u2208 Ng . Letting g run through a countable\nfamily in V , whose linear span is a core for the closure of Es[C], we see that, for\na.a. t > s, Dtf \u2208 V \u2217 and Es[C]\u2217Dtf = DtEs[C]\u2217f . Hence, Es[C]\u2217 is s-adapted.\n\u0001\nBy (iv) and (vi) our definition extends the usual definition for bounded\n(everywhere defined) operators C:\nEs[C] = C\u02dc \u2297 I where C\u02dc = PsC|Fs and I = IF s .\nIn view of property (ii) above, we say that an operator C is maximally s-adapted\nif Es[C] =C.\nProperty (v) expresses the sense in which conditional expectation commutes\nwith the adjoint operation. When applied to already s-adapted operators, or\nmaximally s-adapted operators, it gives us the following useful result.\nCOROLLARY 4.4. Let C be an operator on F which is densely defined and\ns-adapted. If Es[C] is closable, then:\n(a) Es[C\u2217] = Es[C]\u2217;\n(b) Es[C] = Es[C] provided that C\u2217 is s-adapted.\nIn particular, the operators Es[C]\u2217 and Es[C] are maximally s-adapted.\nPROOF. By (v) and (ii), Es[Es[C]\u2217] \u2283 Es[C]\u2217 \u2283 Es[C\u2217]. But C \u2282 Es[C],\nso C\u2217 \u2283 Es[C]\u2217 and therefore Es[C\u2217] \u2283 Es[Es[C]\u2217]. Combining these, we obtain\nEs[C\u2217] \u2283 Es[C]\u2217 \u2283 Es[C\u2217], which gives (a). Now (b) follows easily by applying\n(a) to C\u2217. \u0001\nThus, if C is densely defined, closable and maximally s-adapted, then both\nC\u2217 and C are maximally s-adapted, too. Let A\u2021s denote the collection of closed\ndensely defined and maximally s-adapted operators on F . The next result is\ncomplementary to Proposition 3.3.\nPROPOSITION 4.5. The collection A\u2021s is closed under the Hilbert space\nadjoint operation and contains B(F )\u2229As = B(Fs)\u2297 IF s .\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 509\nPROOF. The first part is contained in Corollary 4.4. Let C \u2208B(F )\u2229As and\nwrite I for IF s . Then, for u \u2208 Fs , C(u \u2297 \u03b4\u2205) = CPs(u \u2297 \u03b4\u2205) =\nPsC(u \u2297 \u03b4\u2205) = u\u2032 \u2297 \u03b4\u2205 for some u\u2032 \u2208 Fs . Therefore, for v \u2208 F s , C(u\u2297 v)(\u03c3 ) =\nCPsD\u03c3(s (u \u2297 v)(\u03c3s)) = v(\u03c3(s)C(u \u2297 \u03b4\u2205)(\u03c3s)) = (u\u2032 \u2297 v)(\u03c3 ). It follows that\nC = C\u02dc \u2297 I for an operator C\u02dc in B(Fs). Conversely, if C\u02dc \u2208 B(Fs), then C\u02dc \u000e I is\ns-adapted by (x) of Theorem 4.3, and C\u02dc \u2297 I = Es[C\u02dc \u000e I ] by the corollary,\nso C\u02dc \u2297 I is s-adapted. \u0001\n4.3. Fock operator processes. Let H be a Fock operator process, that is,\na family (Hs)s\u22650 of operators on F . The process domain of H , denoted PDomH ,\nis the intersection of the domains of its constituent operators; H is measurable,\nor continuous, if, for each f \u2208 PDomH , the map s \u0004\u2192 Hsf is measurable\n(resp. continuous); and H is adapted, or bounded, if each Hs is s-adapted\n(resp. bounded). To H we associate a process H\u0302 by\nH\u0302s = Es[Hs], s \u2265 0.(4.1)\nThus, H\u0302 is an adapted Fock operator process and, when H itself is adapted,\nH\u0302s \u2283 Hs for each s. Therefore, when applied to adapted processes, this procedure\nsystematically extends the domain of the process so that it becomes maximally\nadapted: Es[H\u0302s] = H\u0302s . This is helpful for dealing with unbounded operator-\nvalued processes\u2014in particular, for providing a robust definition of a martingale.\nA process H will be called a Fock operator martingale if it is adapted and satisfies\nEs[H\u0302t ] \u2282 H\u0302s, t \u2265 s.\nBy the tower property of conditional expectations [Theorem 4.3(iii)], this may be\nwritten in the equivalent form Es[Ht ] \u2282 Es[Hs]. If H is a martingale and satisfies\nEs[H\u221e] \u2282 H\u0302s, s \u2265 0,\nfor some operator H\u221e, then H is said to be complete with closure H\u221e. For any\noperator C on F , (Es[C])s\u22650 defines a complete martingale with closure C\u2014such\nmartingales are called exact. Note that closures are nonunique (every martingale\nhas a truly trivial closure!).\nA pair of Fock operator processes (H,H \u2020) is called an adjoint pair of processes\nif each (Hs,H \u2020s ) is an adjoint pair of operators [see (1.4)]. As we have already\nremarked, adaptedness of H does not automatically entail adaptedness of H \u2020 when\nthe process is unbounded. On the other hand, whenever the process domain of H is\ndense, Bessel\u2019s equality using an orthonormal basis drawn from PDomH , shows\nthat H \u2020 is measurable if H is.\nLet A denote the collection of adapted Fock operator processes, let A\u2021 =\n{H \u2208 A :Hs \u2208 A\u2021s for each s}, let Ab = {H \u2208 A :H is bounded, with process\ndomain F } and let M denote the collection of Fock operator martingales.\nPropositions 3.3 and 4.5 give the following result.\n510 S. ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\nPROPOSITION 4.6. A is closed under sums, products and scalar multiples;\nA\u2021 is closed under adjoints; and Ab is a unital \u2217-algebra contained in A\u2021.\nDue to the unavoidable inclusion relations involved in the definition of\nmartingales, there is a dirth of algebraic properties of M. However, the sum of\ntwo exact martingales is a complete martingale, and the collection of bounded\noperator-valued martingales forms a linear space closed under adjoints. Moreover,\nthe following *-subalgebra of Ab has been investigated in [2]:\nAr = {H \u2208Ab :\u2203 Radon measure \u00b5 such that \u2200 t > s > 0 and f \u2208Fs\ns.t. \u2016f \u2016 = 1,\u2016(Ht \u2212Hs)f \u20162 + \u2016(H \u2217t \u2212H \u2217s )f \u20162\n+ \u2016(PsHt \u2212Hs)f \u2016 \u2264\u00b5([s, t[)},\nwhere, following [38], its elements have been called regular semimartingales; they\nare shown to be expressible as sums of QS integrals of processes in Ab; moreover,\nthe resulting integrands are characterized.\n5. QS integrals. In this section we introduce new definitions of stochastic\nintegrals, with respect to the basic processes of QS calculus, for adapted Fock\noperator processes. The technical core is Section 5.2 on commutation relations\nbetween the noncommutative stochastic integrals and sections of the adapted\ngradient operator. It is also verified that the integrals produce martingales and that\nthe martingales are complete.\n5.1. Definitions. Let H be an adapted Fock operator process. Allowing Q to\nstand for either P or D, let VQ(H) denote the subspace of F consisting of those\nvectors f for which:\n\u2022 QsD\u03c4f \u2208 DomHs for a.a. (s < \u03c4), and\n\u2022 the a.e. defined F -valued map (s, \u03c4 ) \u0004\u2192 1{\u03c4>s}HsQsD\u03c4f is measurable.\nFor each f in VQ(H) there is a measurable h-valued map, written (\u03c9, s) \u0004\u2192\nH\nQ\ns f (\u03c9), such that 1\u0004s (\u00b7)HQs f (\u00b7 \u222a \u03c4 ) is a representative of HsQsD\u03c4f for\na.a. (s < \u03c4). This map is uniquely defined up to a set of measure 0, and satisfies\nthe a.e. identity\nHQs f (\u03c9) = (HsQsD\u03c9(s f )(\u03c9s)).\nWe emphasize here that, for each s \u2265 0, while HQs f is a measurable map \u0004 \u2192 h,\nit need not be square integrable\u2014in other words, in general, [HQs f ] \/\u2208 F . Thus,\nHQ\u00b7 f should not be thought of as a Fock vector process\u2014in general, it is not.\nHowever, the following result describes subspaces of vectors f for which the\nmaps HQ\u00b7 f simplify, and it also gives conditions on H for the spaces VQ(H)\nto have a simple description. Recall that the domain of the stochastic gradient \u2207\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 511\ncoincides with that of\n\u221a\nN . Along with V P (H) and VD(H) we associate to H\ntwo additional subspaces of F :\nV (H) := {f \u2208 PDomH : s \u0004\u2192Hsf is measurable},\nV \u2207(H) := {f \u2208 Dom\u2207 :\u2207sf \u2208 DomHs for a.a. s; s \u0004\u2192 Hs\u2207sf is measurable}.\nHere H is a Fock operator process which is not assumed to be adapted.\nPROPOSITION 5.1. Let H be a Fock operator process.\n(a) Suppose that H is adapted.\n(i) If f \u2208 V (H), then f \u2208 V P (H) and [HPs f ] =Hsf for a.a. s.\n(ii) If f \u2208 V \u2207(H), then f \u2208 VD(H) and [HDs f ] =Hs\u2207sf for a.a. s.\n(b) Suppose that H is measurable and adapted. Then V P (H) contains\nPDomH .\n(c) Suppose that H has an adjoint process H \u2020 which is measurable and has\ndense process domain. Then:\n(i) V \u2207(H) = {f \u2208 Dom\u221aN :\u2207sf \u2208 DomHs for a.a. s }.\n(ii) If H is also adapted, then\nVQ(H) = {f \u2208F :QsD\u03c4f \u2208 DomHs for a.a. (s < \u03c4)}.\n(d) Suppose that H is measurable and bounded, with process domainF . Then:\n(i) V \u2207(H) = Dom\u221aN .\n(ii) If H is also adapted, then VD(H) = V P (H) = F .\nPROOF. (ai) This follows easily from the a.e. reproducing property.\n(aii) Let f \u2208 V \u2207(H). Then f \u2208 Dom\u221aN for a.a. (s < \u03c4 ) PsD\u03c4\u2207sf =\nPs\u2207sD\u03c4f = DsD\u03c4f and for a.a. s, \u2207sf \u2208 DomHs . Hence, if H is adapted,\nDsD\u03c4f \u2208 DomHs for a.a. (s < \u03c4 ), and 1{\u03c4>s}HsDsD\u03c4f = 1{\u03c4>s}PsD\u03c4Hs\u2207sf ,\nwhich is a measurable function of (s, \u03c4 ). Hence, f \u2208 VD(H) and, for a.a. (s,\u03c9),\nHDs f (\u03c9) =Hs\u2207sf (\u03c9) by the a.e. reproducing property.\n(b) This is immediate.\n(c) Let H satisfy the condition of (c) and let (en) be an orthonormal basis for F\nselected from PDomH \u2020.\n(i) If f \u2208 Dom\u221aN and \u2207sf \u2208 DomHs for a.a. s, then, by Bessel\u2019s equality,\nHs\u2207sf = \u2211n\u3008H \u2020s en,\u2207sf \u3009en for a.a. s. But this is manifestly a measurable\nfunction of s; therefore, f \u2208 V \u2207(H).\n(ii) If H is adapted and f \u2208 F satisfies QsD\u03c4f \u2208 DomHs for a.a. (s < \u03c4),\nthen, by another application of Bessel\u2019s equality, for a.a. (s < \u03c4),\n1{\u03c4>s}HsQsD\u03c4f = 1{\u03c4>s}\n\u2211\nn\n\u3008H \u2020s en,QsD\u03c4f \u3009en,\nwhich is a measurable function of (s, \u03c4 ). Thus, f \u2208 VQ(H).\n512 S. ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\n(d) This is a special case of (c). \u0001\nThe creation, number, annihilation and time integrals of an adapted Fock\noperator process H are given, respectively, by the (a.e. defined) actions:\nA\u2020(H)f = S(HPf ) :\u03c9 \u0004\u2192\u2211\ns\u2208\u03c9\n(HsPsD\u03c9(s f )(\u03c9s)),\nN(H)f = S(HDf ) :\u03c9 \u0004\u2192\u2211\ns\u2208\u03c9\n(HsDsD\u03c9(s f )(\u03c9s)),\nA(H)f =L(HDf ) :\u03c9 \u0004\u2192\n\u222b\n(HsDsD\u03c9(s f )(\u03c9s)) ds,\nT (H)f =L(HPf ) :\u03c9 \u0004\u2192\n\u222b\n(HsPsD\u03c9(s f )(\u03c9s)) ds,\nwith the following natural domains:\nDomA\u2020(H) = {f \u2208 V P (H) :HPf is Skorohod integrable},\nDomN(H) = {f \u2208 VD(H) :HDf is Skorohod integrable},\nDomA(H) = {f \u2208 VD(H) :HDf is time integrable},\nDomT (H) = {f \u2208 V P (H) :HPf is time integrable}.\nRecall (4.1) defining the extension of an adapted Fock operator process H to\nits maximally adapted form H\u0302 . From the remarks following Proposition 4.2, it\nfollows that V Q(H) = VQ(H\u0302 ) and H\u0302Qf = HQf for f \u2208 VQ(H) and Q = P\nor D. Therefore, each of the QS integrals is unaffected by allowing the integrand\nto achieve its maximally adapted form:\n\u000f(H) =\u000f(H\u0302 ),\nwhere here, and from now on, \u000f stands for a generic QS integrator.\nThe following linear relations are clear from the definitions:\nV Q(H +K) \u2283 VQ(H)\u2229 V Q(K), V Q(\u03bbH) = VQ(H), V Q(0) =F ,\n\u000f(H +K) \u2283 \u000f(H)+\u000f(K), \u000f(\u03bbH) = \u03bb\u000f(H), \u000f(0) = 0,\nwhere H and K are adapted Fock operator processes and \u03bb \u2208 C \\ {0}. Multi-\nplicative relations between the QS integrals constitute the quantum It\u00f4 product\nformulas, to be described in the final section.\nNotice that each of the QS integrals is associated with either adapted differentia-\ntion or projection and with either Skorohod or time integration. It will considerably\nsimplify the development of the basic theory if we forge a unified notation to de-\nscribe the integrals. Thus, to each QS integrator \u000f, we associate R\u000f \u2208 {S,L} as\nwell as R\u000f \u2208 {P,D} and Q\u000f \u2208 {P,D} as follows: for \u000f = A\u2020,N,A or T , the\ntriple (R,R,Q), respectively, equals\n(S,D,P ), (S,D,D), (L,P ,D) or (L,P ,P ).(5.1)\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 513\nThus, \u000f is determined by the pair (R\u000f,Q\u000f), R\u000f is determined by R\u000f and vice\nversa. The definitions of the four QS integrals are thereby unified:\nDom\u000f(H) = {f \u2208 VQ(H) :HQf is R-integrable},\n\u000f(H)f =R(HQf ),\nwhere Q = Q\u000f and R =R\u000f. The notation R\u000f will come into its own when the\nfundamental formulas are extended (Section 6.3).\nOne further notation\u2014each QS integrator has an adjoint integrator:\n(A\u2020)\u2020 =A, N\u2020 = N, T \u2020 = T .\nHaving found a compact expression for the integrals, let us unravel somewhat,\nto get a better view of their workings. Let H be an adapted Fock operator process\nand let f \u2208 VQ(H). Then, for \u03c4 = {t1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < tn}, the following a.e. relation holds:\nHQs f (\u03c4 )=\nn\u2211\nk=0\n1[tk,tk+1[(s)\n(\nHsQsDtk+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Dtnf\n)\n(t1, . . . , tk),\nwhere t0 = 0 and tn+1 = \u221e. Thus,\nS(HQf )(\u03c4 )=\nn\u2211\nk=1\n(\nHtkQtkDtk+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Dtnf\n)\n(t1, . . . , tk\u22121),(5.2a)\nand, if s \u0004\u2192HQs f (\u03c4 ) is integrable,\nL(HQf )(\u03c4 ) =\nn\u2211\nk=0\n\u222b tk+1\ntk\n(\nHsQsDtk+1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Dtnf\n)\n(t1, . . . , tk).(5.2b)\nTherefore, (5.2a) and (5.2b) are a.e. expressions for \u000f(H)f (\u03c4 ) when f \u2208\nDom\u000f(H), for \u000f= A\u2020 or N , respectively, A or T .\nThe following identities are easily established.\nLEMMA 5.2. Let H be an adapted Fock operator process and let f \u2208 VQ(H),\nwhere Q = P or D. Then the following relations hold (a.e.):\nDtf,Ptf \u2208 VQ(1[0,t[H ),(5.3a)\nDtH\nQ\ns f = 1[0,t[(s)HQs Dtf +DtHsQsf,(5.3b)\nPtH\nQ\ns f = 1[0,t[(s)HQs Ptf + 1[t,\u221e[(s)PtHsQsf,(5.3c)\nPtH\nQ\nt f = HtQtf.(5.3d)\nIn particular, 1[0,t[(s)(DtHQs f )(\u03c9) gives a version of 1[0,t[(s)(HQs Dtf )(\u03c9) which\nis jointly measurable in s, t , \u03c9.\n514 S. ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\n5.2. Commutation relations. We next apply the commutation relations ob-\ntained in Section 2.5 to QS integrals. This allows us to deduce adaptedness and\nmartingale properties in the next section. It is also the first step toward solving the\nproblems raised by the It\u00f4 calculus approach to QS calculus (see Section 7.2).\nIn the rest of the paper, \u000ft(H) will be used to abbreviate \u000f(1[0,t[H).\nTHEOREM 5.3. Let H be an adapted Fock operator process and let f \u2208\nVQ(H), where Q =Q\u000f and \u000f =A\u2020 or N . Then the following are equivalent:\n(a) f \u2208 Dom\u000f(H).\n(b) Dtf \u2208 Dom\u000ft(H) for a.a. t , and t \u0004\u2192 \u000ft(H)Dtf + HtQtf is It\u00f4\nintegrable.\nWhen these hold we have the a.e. identity\nDt\u000f(H)f =\u000ft(H)Dtf +HtQtf.(5.4)\nPROOF. In view of (5.3d), Proposition 2.6 applies to HQf . If f \u2208 Dom\u000f(H),\nthen HQf is Skorohod integrable so 1[0,t[(\u00b7)DtHQf is Skorohod integrable for\na.a. t , and\nDtS(H\nQf ) = St0(DtHQ\u00b7 f )+ PtHQt f,\nwhich is square integrable in t . By (5.3a) and (5.3b), f satisfies (b), and the a.e.\nidentity (5.4) holds. Conversely, if f satisfies (b), then, since (5.3b) implies that\n\u000ft(H)Dtf = St0(HQ\u00b7 Dtf ) = St0(DtHQ\u00b7 f ),\nProposition 2.6 gives the Skorohod integrability of HQf \u2014in other words,\nf \u2208 Dom\u000f(H). \u0001\nTHEOREM 5.4. Let H be an adapted Fock operator process and let\nf \u2208 VQ(H) be such that (H\u00b7Q\u00b7f )(\u2205) is integrable, where Q = Q\u000f and \u000f = A\nor T .

In view of (5.3d), HQ\u00b7 f (\u2205) is integrable and so Proposition 2.7\napplies. If f \u2208 Dom\u000f(H) and H\u00b7Q\u00b7f is time integrable, then, by Proposition 2.7,\nboth DtHQ\u00b7 f and DtH\u00b7Q\u00b7f are time integrable for a.a. t , and\nL(DtH\nQ\u00b7 f ) = DtL(HQ\u00b7 f ) =Dt\u000f(H)f,\nL(DtH\u00b7Q\u00b7f ) = DtL(H\u00b7Q\u00b7f ),\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 515\nboth of which are square integrable in t . By (5.3b), therefore, Dtf \u2208 Dom\u000ft(H),\n(5.5) holds and both \u000f(H)Dtf and L(DtH\u00b7Q\u00b7f ) are square integrable in t .\nThus, f satisfies (b). Conversely, if f satisfies (b), then, by (5.3b), DtHQ\u00b7 f =\n1[0,t[(\u00b7)HQ\u00b7 Dtf +DtH\u00b7Q\u00b7f , which is time integrable by (bi) and (bii), with time\nintegral \u000ft(H)Dtf + L(DtH\u00b7Q\u00b7f ), which is It\u00f4 integrable by (biii). Hence,\nusing Proposition 2.7 once more, HQ\u00b7 f is time integrable\u2014in other words,\nf \u2208 Dom\u000f(H), so that (a) holds. \u0001\nPROPOSITION 5.5.

The next two results confirm\nthat our definitions synchronize satisfactorily.\nPROPOSITION 5.6. Let H be an adapted Fock operator process and let t \u2265 0.\nThen, for each QS integrator \u000f, the operator \u000ft(H) is u adapted for each u\u2265 t .\nPROOF. Let f \u2208 Dom\u000ft(H) and let u \u2265 t . First, note that, by (5.3a),\nPuf,Duf \u2208 VQ(1[0,t[H). Since \u000fu(1[0,t[H) = \u000ft(H) and 1[u,\u221e[(\u00b7)Pu \u00d7\n1[0,t[(\u00b7)H\u00b7Q\u00b7f = 0, Proposition 5.5 implies that Puf \u2208 Dom\u000ft(H) and\nPu\u000ft(H)f = \u000ft(H)Puf . Since 1{u<t}HuQuf = 0, Theorem 5.3 implies that\nDuf \u2208 Dom\u000ft(H) and \u000ft(H)Duf = Du\u000ft(H)f for \u000f = A\u2020 or N . For \u000f = A\nor T , (5.3b) implies that DuHQs f = HQs Duf for s < t . Therefore, by Proposi-\ntion 2.7, 1[0,t[HQ\u00b7 Duf is time integrable, so that Duf \u2208 Dom\u000ft(H) and\n\u000ft(H)Duf =Lt (HQ\u00b7 Duf ) =DuLt (HQf ) = Du\u000ft(H)f.\nThis completes the proof. \u0001\n516 S. ATTAL AND J. M. LINDSAY\nTHEOREM 5.7. Let H be an adapted Fock operator process. Then, for\n\u000f =A\u2020, N or A, \u000f\u00b7(H) is a complete martingale with closure \u000f(H).\nPROOF. Let t \u2265 0, let u \u2208 [t,\u221e] and let f \u2208 Dom(Et [\u000fu(H)]). Then\nPtD\u03b2f \u2208 Dom(\u000fu(H)), the map \u03b2 \u0004\u2192 1{\u03b2>t}Pt\u000fu(H)PtD\u03b2f is square in-\ntegrable \u0004 \u2192 F and Et [\u000fu(H)]f (\u03c9) = (Pt\u000fu(H)PuD\u03c9(t f )(\u03c9t)) for a.a. \u03c9.\nThus, by part (c) of Theorem 5.5, f \u2208 DomEt [\u000ft(H)] and Et [\u000ft(H)]f =\nEt [\u000fu(H)]f . This shows that\nEt [\u000fu(H)] \u2282 Et [\u000ft(H)],(5.6)\nand so \u000f\u00b7(H) is a complete martingale, with closure \u000f(H). \u0001\nREMARK. In view of Proposition 5.5(d), we have the following cases of\nequality in the complete martingale inclusion relations (5.6):\nEt [Nu(H)] = Et [Nt(H)], Et [Au(H)] = Et [At(H)].\nIn other words, the martingales E \u00b7[N\u00b7(H)] and E \u00b7[A\u00b7(H)] are exact.\n5.4. Recursion formula. The commutation relations between adapted gradient\nand QS integrals lead to recursion formulas for the integrals. This is the second step\ntoward solving the problems raised by the It\u00f4 calculus approach.\nTHEOREM 5.8. Let H be an adapted Fock operator process and let f \u2208\nDom\u000f(H). If H\u00b7Q\u00b7f is R-integrable, then the following is well defined and valid:\n\u000f(H)f = I(\u000f\u00b7(H)D\u00b7f )+R(H\u00b7Q\u00b7f ),\nwhere R=R\u000f and Q =Q\u000f.\nPROOF. Theorem 5.3 (resp. Theorem 5.4) applies. Noting that H\u00b7Q\u00b7f is\nadapted, so that if R = S then R(H\u00b7Q\u00b7f ) = I(H\u00b7Q\u00b7f ), the result follows by It\u00f4\nintegration of (5.4) [resp. (5.5)]. \u0001\n6. Restricted-domain QS integrals. In this section we introduce restricted\ndomains for QS integrals, which lead to good adjoint relations, as well as\nextensions of the fundamental formulas of QS calculus. These latter are a\ncornerstone of the calculus [37].\n6.1. Definition and example. Let H be an adapted Fock operator process. We\ndefine the restricted-domain QS integral R\u000f(H) to be the restriction of \u000f(H) to\nDomR\u000f(H) := {f \u2208 VQ(H) :HQf if absolutely R-integrable},\nwhere Q = Q\u000f and R =R\u000f are as given by (5.1), and absolute R-integrability\nis defined in Section 2.1.\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 517\nA simplifying feature of restricted-domain QS integrals is the inclusions:\nDomR\u000fs(H) \u2283 DomR\u000ft(H)\nfor s \u2264 t ; in particular, PDomR\u000f\u00b7(H) \u2282 DomR\u000f(H). Another is that the\nprocesses t \u0004\u2192 R\u000ft(H) are continuous (Proposition 6.4).\nBefore developing the theory, we illustrate the restriction by the example of\nFermi field operators as QS integrals.\nEXAMPLE. Let J be the unitary process defined by Jsf (\u03c9) = (\u22121)#\u03c9s)f (\u03c9).\nThen\nJPs f (\u03c9) = (\u22121)#\u03c9s)f (\u03c9) and JDs f (\u03c9)= (\u22121)#\u03c9s)f (\u03c9 \u222a s).\nFor every f , JPf is Skorohod integrable and JDf is time integrable [4],\nSt\n(\u2016JD\u00b7 f (\u00b7)\u2016h)(\u03c9) = #\u03c9t)\u2016f (\u03c9)\u2016\nand\nLt\n(\u2016JD\u00b7 f (\u00b7)\u2016h)(\u03c9) = \u222b t0 \u2016f (\u03c9 \u222a s)\u2016ds\n\u2014neither of which is square integrable in \u03c9 in general\u2014so JPf is not\nabsolutely Skorohod integrable and JDf is not absolutely time integrable. Thus,\nwhereas A\u2020t (J ) and At(J ) both have domain F , and are, in fact, bounded, RA\n\u2020\nt (J )\nand RAt(J ) have strictly smaller domains. These operators are Fermi creation and\nannihilation field operators realized on boson Fock space [24].\nLEMMA 6.1. Let f \u2208 DomR\u000f(H), where H is an adapted Fock operator\nprocess and \u000f is a QS integrator, and let Q= Q\u000f and R=R\u000f. Then the adapted\nFock vector process H\u00b7Q\u00b7f is absolutely R-integrable.\nPROOF. Since f \u2208 VQ(H), the map s \u0004\u2192 HsQsf = 1\u0004s(\u2205)HsQsD\u2205f is\nmeasurable R+ \u2192 F . Since HsQsf = 1\u0004sHQs f , H\u00b7Q\u00b7f is absolutely R-in-\ntegrable. \u0001\nREMARK. By Proposition 2.2, since H\u00b7Q\u00b7f is adapted, it is It\u00f4 integrable if\n\u000f =A\u2020 or N .\nLEMMA 6.2. Let X = R\u000f\u00b7(H) for an adapted Fock operator process H and\nQS integrator \u000f. If f \u2208 PDomX, then:\n(i) Ptf \u2208 DomXt for all t \u2265 0;\n(ii) Dtf \u2208 DomXt for a.a. t .\nPROOF. Let x(\u03c9, s) = \u2016HQs f (\u03c9)\u2016, so that x is R-integrable, and, by (5.3b),\n1[0,t[(s)Ptxs(\u03c9) = 1[0,t[(s)\u2016HQs Ptf (\u03c9)\u2016\nso that Ptf \u2208 DomR\u000ft(H) for each t \u2265 0.

In this section we show that the\nintegrals defined in the last two sections are consistent with previous approaches.\nNote that the Hudson\u2013Parthasarathy definitions, on exponential domains, are\nsubsumed by each of the noncausal and the It\u00f4 calculus formulations.\n7.1. Noncausal approach ([9, 27]). Let H be a Fock operator process. Recall\nthe notation at the beginning of Section 5. The noncausal QS integrals are defined\nas follows:\nNCA\u2020(H)f = S(H\u00b7f ), NCN(H)f = S(H\u00b7\u2207\u00b7f ),\nNCA(H)f =\n\u222b\nHs\u2207sf ds, NCT (H)f =\n\u222b\nHsf ds,\nwith respective domains\nDom NCA\u2020(H) = {f \u2208 V (H) :H\u00b7f \u2208 DomS},\nDom NCN(H) = {f \u2208 V \u2207(H) :H\u00b7\u2207\u00b7f \u2208 DomS},\nDom NCA(H) = {f \u2208 V \u2207(H) :H\u00b7\u2207\u00b7f is integrable},\nDom NCT (H) = {f \u2208 V (H) :H\u00b7f is integrable}.\nWe show that, when applied to adapted processes, these give restrictions of the QS\nintegrals of this paper.\nTHEOREM 7.1. Let H be an adapted Fock operator process. Then the\nfollowing inclusions hold:\nNCA\u2020(H) \u2282 A\u2020(H), NCN(H) \u2282N(H),\nNCA(H) \u2282 RA(H), NCT (H) \u2282 RT (H).\nQUANTUM STOCHASTIC CALCULUS 523\nPROOF. Since, for a map x :\u0004 \u00d7 R+ \u2192 h, x is Skorohod integrable if\nx \u2208 DomS and x is absolutely time integrable if it is (Bochner) integrable\n(Proposition 2.1), the result follows immediately from Proposition 5.1. \u0001\n7.2. It\u00f4 calculus approach ([5]). We first recall the treatment in [5] where QS\nintegrals are extended beyond an exponential domain. Let F,G,H and K be four\nadapted Fock operator processes which are measurable and have common process\ndomain V , where V is a subspace of F containing V0 \u000e E(S) for some dense\nsubspace V0 and admissible subset S and which also satisfy the local integrability\n(and implied measurability) conditions\u222b t\n0\n{\u2016FsPsf \u20162 + \u2016GsDsf \u20162 + \u2016HsDsf \u2016 + \u2016KsPsf \u2016}ds < \u221e\nfor all f \u2208 V and t \u2265 0. An adapted Fock operator process X with process\ndomain V is denoted by\u222b t\n0\nFs dA\n\u2020\ns +\n\u222b t\n0\nGs dNs +\n\u222b t\n0\nHs dAs +\n\u222b t\n0\nKs ds\nprovided that, for each f \u2208 V and t \u2265 0:\n(i) Dsf \u2208 DomXs for a.a. s, and s \u0004\u2192 1{s<t}XsDsf is square integrable;\n(ii)\nXtf =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nXs\u2227tDsf d\u03c7s\n+\n\u222b t\n0\n{FsPsf +GsDsf }d\u03c7s +\n\u222b t\n0\n{HsDsf +KsPsf }ds.\nHere the alternative notation for It\u00f4 integration discussed after Proposition 2.2\nis being employed. When V equals V0 \u000e E(S), this is equivalent to Xt being the\ncorresponding Hudson\u2013Parthasarthy QS integral, and under various conditions the\nrepresentation (ii) is valid on larger domains V . This is exploited, in particular, in\nthe QS-integral representability of regular semimartingales [2]. However, since\nthe Fock operator process X appears on the right-hand side, (ii) represents a\nkind of system of Fock space vector-valued stochastic differential equations. In\nother words, the Fock operator process X is only defined implicitly through (ii).\nIt was not known in general whether this system has a solution, nor whether any\nsolution it might have is unique; moreover, nothing was known about appropriate\n(maximal) domains for a Fock operator solution process. We shall see that our\nintegrals solve all three of these problems.\nFor an adapted Fock operator process H , let r\u000f\u00b7(H) denote the QS process\n\u000f\u00b7(H) restricted as follows:\nDom r\u000ft (H) := {f \u2208 Dom\u000ft(H) : 1[0,t](\u00b7)H\u00b7Q\u00b7D\u03b2f(7.1)\nis R-integrable for a.a. \u03b2 > t},\n524 S.

(5.1)]. By a \u201csolution of (A-M)\u201d we mean a pair (X,D) consisting\nof an adapted Fock operator process X and a Fock-adapted space D contained\nin PDomX, such that, for each f \u2208D :\n(i) Dsf \u2208 DomXs for a.a. s;\n(ii) X\u00b7D\u00b7f is locally square integrable;\n(iii) Qsf \u2208 DomHs for a.a. s;\n(iv) H\u00b7Q\u00b7f is locally R-integrable\nand the identity (A-M) holds for each t > 0.

In this section we show that the compo-\nsition of QS integrals is given by integration by parts with a correction term when\nWick ordering of the integrators is violated. We give the result in two forms, one\nin which the correction is present and one in which it need not be. Whereas the\nquantum It\u00f4 product formula obtained by Hudson and Parthasarathy is an identity\nin Fock space inner products (their second fundamental formula), in Theorem 8.1\nwe have achieved a product formula which is an identity between the Fock space\noperators. The second form is a basic consequence, for operator products of QS\nintegrals, of our extension of the second fundamental formula\u2014no longer tied to\nexponential vectors.\nFor both theorems let F and G be adapted Fock operator processes, let \u000f and \u000f\u2032\nbe QS integrators and let \u000f\u0010 equal A\u2020,N,A or T , if the ordered pair (\u000f,\u000f\u2032) is,\nrespectively, (N,A\u2020), (N,N ), (A,N ) or (A,A\u2020), and let \u000f\u0010 equal 0 otherwise.\nRecall the restricted QS integals r\u000f(H) defined in (7.1).\nTHEOREM 8.1.

If (\u000f,\u000f\u2032) is one of (N,A\u2020), (N,N),\n(A,N) or (A,A\u2020), then Z\u00b7f = 0 for all f in D .\nPROOF.

If g \u2208 DomY \u2229 DomW , then, by Theorem 6.7,\nProposition 6.5 and Corollary 6.6,\n\u3008X\u2020f,Yg\u3009 = \u3008f,Wg\u3009 \u2200f \u2208 Dom(X\u2020).\nSince X\u2020 is densely defined, this implies that Yg \u2208 Dom(X\u2020)\u2217 and\n(X\u2020)\u2217Yg = (\u000f(FY )+\u000f\u2032(XG)+\u000f\u0010(FG))g.\nThe result follows. \u0001\nAs a consequence of this theorem, we have the quantum It\u00f4 product formula\n\u000f(F)R\u000f\u2032(G)g = (R\u000f(FY )+ R\u000f\u2032(XG)+ R\u000f\u0010(FG))g,\nwhere Xt = \u000ft(F ), Yt = R\u000f\u2032t (G) and \u000f\u0010 is the It\u00f4-correcting QS integrator,\nwhenever g lies in the domain of both left- and right-hand side operators.\n528 S.
