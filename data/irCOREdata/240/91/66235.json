Power and \ndecision making in Primary Care \n \nArticle 8000 words \n \n \nThis article uses theoretical approaches to the discussion of power to consider the role of \npublic and patient participation in Primary Care organisations in the UK. There is \nconsiderable evidence to suggest that, despite major national initiatives to extend \nparticipation in health services, its role in decision-making remains under-developed. \nThe primary purpose of this article is to understand how and why this should be the case. \nUsing findings from qualitative research that explored approaches taken by the dominant \nprofessional groups on Primary Care Groups (PCGs) to involving patients and the \npublic, we consider how these approaches reflect the exercise of different forms and \nlevels of power. The explanation combines Lukes\u2019 categorisation of three forms of power \nwith Bourdieu\u2019s dynamic conceptualisation of the relations of habitus and field. It is \nargued that the models observed represent different opportunities for the operation of \npower with implications consequences for the role that participation can play. \n \n \nKeywords: involvement, participation, power, habitus, consumer, citizen \n \n \nIntroduction \n \n Successive Governments in the UK have expressed their intention to involve patients \nand the public more extensively in decision making about health services, although the \nnature and extent of intended involvement varies (DOH 2001, 2003, NHS Management \nExecutive 1992). Despite the body of guidance from central government, there is \nconsiderable room for local discretion, particularly about the methods used. In \nconsequence, the approach taken to involvement and its particular local manifestation \nvaries widely (Milewa, Dowswell and Harrison, 2002).  A recent review concluded that \nthere had been little real progress in extending involvement (Farrell, 2004). One \nexplanation for this could be that the true purpose lies in its symbolic meaning rather than \n 1\nany real intended impact on relations (Hood ref). Our research suggested that this \nexplanation was not sufficient. We identified genuine interest in the role participation \ncould play (authors 2002). Here we want to explore the question by considering how \nissues of legitimacy and power manifest themselves in the action taken by the newly \ncreated Primary Care organisations to involving patients and the public. The argument of \nthis article is that to understand participation we need to go beyond the empirical account \nto explore, theoretically, the relationship between the roles of stakeholders and the \ndiffering claims to knowledge and legitimacy, within which struggles for power are \nconducted. \nLukes formulation of power and its operation in the dynamic relations between habitus \nand field (Bourdieu, 1977) are employed to analyse how participation is understood and \nhow far it shapes decision-making in health services.  \n \nPrimary Care organisations provide a useful context for the study of participation because \nthey combine novelty of organisational form with existing histories of involvement \n(Klein and New 1998, Barnes 1997). These organisations became operational in 2000 and \nwere designed to solve the problems of inequity created through General Practitioner \n(GP) fundholding. The Primary Care Group (PCG) and subsequently, Primary Care \nTrusts (PCTs) brought together professionals and lay people to develop services for the \nlocality. They signalled some degree of reorientation from medical to social models. \nAlthough dominated by GP members, boards included representatives from social \nservices and the lay public to broaden the social perspective. The fieldwork discussed \nhere focuses on the early experience of primary care organisations and their orientation to \n 2\ninvolvement. The contribution this article seeks to make, however, is not primarily \nempirical. The relevance of the analysis is based on its usefulness beyond the specific \ncontext of organisational constitution. Since the fieldwork was completed the transition to \nPrimary Care Trust status has brought about a changed composition of board \nmembership, increasing the size of lay membership. We will argue however, that we can \nlearn more through understanding the rival claims to legitimacy that members rely on \nthan by counting the balance of interests represented. It is widely acknowledged that lay \nmembership, of itself, does not guarantee representativeness of wider groups of patients \nand the public.  Further, power struggles between professionals and managerial \nemployees of the health service have been well documented. Indeed, research has shown \nthat these groups have sought to colonise the voices of publics and patients (Mort and \nHarrison, 1999). Our research focuses on the level of the board because the relationship it \nestablishes with the public is emergent from a combination of these conflicts, policy \nexpectations and more straightforward participatory objectives. Despite continuing \ninternal struggle boards are required to involve the population in decision-making about \nservice planning and delivery precisely because the legitimacy of interests from outside \nNHS organisations has been recognised. We need to explore contested claims a to \nlegitimacy at this level to understand how participation is being effected or made \nredundant.  \nThe requirement for boards seek to involve patients and the public raises the question of \nhow they, as initiators and users of the products of involvement, conceive of those they \ninvolve. On what basis should participants have a voice in decision-making and what role \nshould those voices play? To explore these issues it is important to recognise that \n 3\nindividuals may occupy different roles in health services, those of the public, patient, \nconsumer and citizen. Each implies different bases of legitimacy with consequences for \nstructures for participation and their impact on decision-making processes.  \n \nBases of legitimacy: Consumer or Citizen, Patients and Public \nThe notion of the consumer identifies a relationship between individuals and their \nservices, primarily with rights of exit supported by limited rights of voice. Consumers \nspeak with the authority of having used, or being prospective users of, services and \ntherefore with a legitimate interest in provision on a personal basis. Apart from the right \nto be heard, consumers have the right to exit or to choose an alternative service. The \ndifficulties involved in exercising these rights in relation to welfare goods, have long \nbeen recognised (Potter 1998, Titmus, 1976, Hambleton, 1988). By contrast, the role of \ncitizen is based on the legitimacy of legal, political and social membership of the \ncommunity. Here the legitimacy implies involvement as part of a collective, defining  \npriorities in the interests of the wider community. Citizen involvement is based on \ndemocratic principles and the aim of involvement stretches beyond consumerist notions \nof individual satisfaction to ensure responsiveness and accountability for the use of public \nresources. \n \nThe two concepts suggest different answers to questions about the influence that \nstakeholders should have. While consumers should be listened to, those in power quite \nproperly weigh such individualised perspectives against the good of the community as a \nwhole. The good of the whole population, conversely, is the precise basis for legitimacy \n 4\nin the citizen involvement model and, consequently, professional interests can no longer \nclaim exclusive rights to represent that view.  \nNeither consumer nor citizen can automatically claim expert status within health contexts \nand the voices of medical professionals and managers within the NHS have generally \nprevailed. This has to be understood as both historical background, and as an expression \nof a current set of competing interests. Introducing the concept of citizenship however, \nimplies a necessary redefinition in the relative power to be exercised by public, \nprofessionals and managers. \nThe divide between patients and the public is less clear in so far as these are overlapping \nstatuses. Patients can speak with authority drawn from experience of service, the \ncontribution of the public is more difficult to identify on this ground. The tendency \ntherefore to align the public with citizenship and patient with consumer status is \nunderstandable. Such elision needs to be resisted in the interests of understanding \nlegitimacy. \nEvidence for these bases of legitimacy can be found in government guidance. The \ncitizenship agenda is stressed in Cabinet office (2000) and Department of Health \nguidance. The latter urged PCG\/Ts to work with local communities, \u2018to develop shared \ngoals and aims for improving health and well-being (1998:21). The NHS plan describes, \n\u2018fundamental reforms which will bring patients and citizens into decision making at every \nlevel.... It will enhance and encourage the involvement of the citizen in redesigning the \nhealth service from the patient\u2019s point of view\u2019 (Dept of Health, 2000:95).  \n \n 5\nThe roles envisaged for \u201cpatients and citizens\u201d in these documents are ill-defined and the \nterms are often used as though they were interchangeable. The scope for involvement in \nservices is generally described in more limited and technical terms than those suggested \nabove. Yet these different bases for legitimacy have significant implications for the \ndegree to which professionals should retain control of decision-making or yield control to \npatients and\/or the public.  \n \nPower and forms of capital \nTwo (generally implicit) conceptions of power are relevant. A variable model, as \nproposed by Parsons (1986) suggests that increasing the power held by some does not \ninevitably mean wresting power from others. This approach is consistent with the view \nthat professionals can improve participation by building capacity and developing social \ncapital, based in existing community networks (Putnam, 1995).  Alternatively, Weber \n(1986), sees power as a finite resource which can only be gained by one group at the \nexpense of another, with the implication that, for participation to be effective, power must \nbe redistributed.  \n \nThe approach adopted in this article is to combine insights into power relationships \noffered by Lukes and Bourdieu. It situates relationships between habitus, capital and field \nand in articulation with Lukes\u2019 (1974, 1986) three dimensions of power to provide a \nmeans to analyse these forms in a dynamic way. It recognizes the danger of thinking of \npower, \u2018as something, rather than as a property of relations\u2019 (p164, Clegg 2002) and \nseeks rather to base an \u2018analysis of power on the study of techniques and tactics of \n 6\ndomination\u2019 (Foucault p237, 1986). In taking this approach we resist the view of Lukes \n(particularly third) form of power as subject to a  \u2018form of supreme sovereign will (Clegg, \np4, 1989) and instead interpret it in a realist frame which recognises both the shaping \nreality of the material world and the role of consciousness and action. Bourdieu\u2019s \napproach is expressly intended to achieve this understanding.- I\u2019M NOT SURE ABOUT \nTHIS- I WORRY WE RISK A VERY SUPERFICIAL TREATMENT OF FOUCAULT \nBY NODDING IN HIS DIRECTION HERE- BUT WE REALLY DON\u2019T HAVE THE \nSPACE TO WORK ON IT PROPERLY- what do you think?) \nLukes' (1974) three-dimensional analysis offers valuable insights into the forms which \npower takes.  It includes; the most obvious form of power as force or domination, \nexercised when there is a conflict of interests; power which relies on dominant values and \nbeliefs in limiting the agenda to ensure that only relatively \u2018safe\" issues' are discussed, \nand:   power inherent in the \u2018bias of the system\u2019 which  encompasses the culture \nunderpinning the behaviour of groups and institutions. This third face of power can be \nexpressed, both through collective action that is manifest in individual behaviour, and \nthrough the more impersonal, accepted social patterns. \n \nLukes typology of power is reflected in dynamic form in Bourdieu\u2019s formulation of \nhabitus and field. Bourdieu (1989) introduces the notions of habitus and field of power to \nidentify the relationship between actors and the structures they at times work within, and \nat times resist or struggle to change. Habitus is primarily the set of pre-conscious actions \nthrough which daily living is conducted.   It permits the actor to work in routine ways in a \nfield without always choosing their actions. Thus, we may carry out habitual actions and \n 7\nwork according to accepted cultural values in a way that does not entail conscious \nthought and evaluation. The concept is rescued form becoming overly determinist by \nrecognising the potential for habitus to become conscious, subject to reflexive human \nagency. A specific habitus is developed in relation to the conditions and contingencies of \nthe particular field and the two must, therefore, be understood in relation to each other. \n \nBourdieu develops an account of forms of values deployed within a field including \neconomic, social, cultural and symbolic capital. Cultural capital includes the possession \nof culturally recognised attributes and competences. This is the main source of \nprofessional and managerial power as professional and academic qualifications confer \nstrong claims to cultural capital in the health service. Symbolic capital arises from \ncultural and other forms of capital and expresses more intangible elements of reputation \nand social standing.  Social capital arises from the fabric created in communities by \nshared experience. Understanding how the collective elements of habitus feed into the \nstructural level is fundamental to understanding the processes through which social \nstructures are created and reproduced. Social capital is then understood as one form of \ncapital, interacting with other forms within a field, to provide a dynamic account of the \ndistribution of power and resources. \nActors deploy their capital to maximise their position in an ever-changing field and the \nparticular distribution of power is the outcome of their interplay (Bourdieu, 1993, 1999). \nThe operation of habitus within a field is evidence of this distribution in that it points to \nvalues which are simply accepted.  \n 8\nThe analysis of habitus is important in explaining how actors contribute to the \ntransformation or preservation of power relations within the field.  The field of medicine \nand health care has been strongly dominated by holders of cultural and symbolic capital. \nThe potential for public involvement to be a vehicle for claiming some of this power is \nclear. In developing an account of the roles of cultural, social and symbolic capital in the \nNHS we will examine the scope for involvement in primary care and understand how this \nground is contested.  \n \n \n Contesting the value of Cultural Capital in the field of health \n \nThe possession of high levels of cultural and symbolic capital by professionals in health \nenables them to exercise power, which is institutionalised in decision-making structures.  \nSuch capital historically endowed professionals with a strong claim to authority. \nBourdieu emphasises, however, that a field is a dynamic space in which there is a \ncontinuous struggle to maximise position through the accumulation of capital. In recent \nyears the legitimacy of patient and the public\u2019s claims to power have gained ground, \nbased on questioning of professional knowledge and competence, most evident in cases \nof clinical negligence (Kennedy, 2001). That it is not an open struggle arises to some \ndegree, from the relations of \u2018misrecognition\u2019, which so characterise the field of health \ncare (Bourdieu, 1999). Through their cultural and symbolic capital, professionals \nrepresent their exercise of power as disinterested, while patients have accepted this \n 9\ndominance as \u2018natural\u2019, confirming a habitus of trust and deference among recipients of \nhealth service care. \nIn this article we intend to examine the relationship between forms of knowledge and \ntheir relative legitimacy within the wider context of participation in decisions about \nhealth.  The basis for examining early thinking about participation is expressed by \nThomas and Thomas when they say, \u2018If men define situations as real, they are real in \ntheir consequences\u2019 (1928:572 quoted in Ritzer, G. 2000). To understand the potential \nfor, and limits to, participation it is necessary to understand how those who are in a \nposition to enlist it, in practice define it. Our primary interest was in exploring boards\u2019 \nearly orientations toward the part that participation could play in decision-making. What \nroles did they think patients and the public should play? Which activities and areas of the \nboard\u2019s responsibilities were appropriate for participation and which should be the \npreserve of the board alone? We further sought to learn about the mechanisms for \nparticipation that were emerging and to discover any impacts on board decision making.  \nThe research is reported in detail elsewhere (Authors, 2002).  Our purpose here lies \nbeyond the particularities of an ever-changing policy context, to consider the forces that \nunderpin, provoke and, frequently, limit the nature and direction of policy development. \nIn the next section therefore, we present some evidence from two issues addressed in the \nfieldwork as illustrative of the operation of these forces and relations. Following this we  \ndiscuss the implications of the framework for analysis outlined briefly above. \n \n 10\nMethods  \nThe fieldwork was based in two localities in the North of England for a regionally funded \nstudy of early approaches to public and patient participation in Primary Care Groups. The \nsites selected were  of comparable population size and demographic structure. Both had \nrural profiles but, while the population was widely dispersed in one, the second had a \nsubstantial concentration of its population in a single town. These areas of similarity and \ndifference were incorporated into the study design partly to allow exploration of the \nparticipation of harder-to-reach rural populations.  \nQualitative interviews were held with twenty people, including Chairs, Chief Executives, \nGPs, lay, social services and nursing members of boards in 2000. In both boards GPs \nformed the largest single group, while individual representatives form other professions \nwithin the health service and related organizations and a single lay member, constituted  \nthe remainder. Respondents are differentiated from each other by locality (A or B) and by \nnumber, to demonstrate the range of voices reported. In view of our commitment to \nmaintain confidentiality, (more difficult to sustain internally for participants in a small \nlocal study), they are not identified by role. \n \nThe role of the PCG \n \nOne factor, which fundamentally shapes views on participation, concerns how broadly \nthe board defines its own sphere of operation. Taking a broad definition of its own role \nentails involvement in social and environmental issues, which may be beyond the direct \ncontrol of the board. The interviews suggested divisions of view within the boards on this \n 11\nmatter, with GP members, in particular, preferring the more restricted medical and \nservice-based interpretation of their role.  This definition, combined with the requirement \nto invite participation inevitably affects the operation of power: \n managers professionally will face a change in the way we work and some of that means \nletting go, it never feels comfortable to let go some of your decisions or take those \ndecisions more openly and it\u2019s the same for the other professions, particularly GPs.  \n(B:2) \nIn both localities participation was treated as a 'good' thing but little debate had taken \nplace about its purpose or the range of processes by which it might be secured. This \nallowed unexamined values to underpin agenda-setting and define the limits for \ninvolvement.  Early indications from other research suggest this phenomenon was not \nuncommon (Florin 2000). \n \nParticipation was generally a low-level \u2018softer\u2019 priority, given the policy constraints \nunder which boards act, \u2018when the going gets tough and the waiting list targets aren\u2019t \nbeing met and the budget\u2019s overspent\u2026\u2019 participation tends, \u2018to drift off the edge\u2019 (A:2) \n \nWhile at a practical level this prioritisation is understandable, it is a revealing indication \nof which perspectives were regarded as sufficient to constitute proper decision-making. It \nillustrated the dominant habitus within the boards in relation to the inclusion of public \nvoices. Nevertheless traditional forms of public accountability were an issue that the \nboard must take seriously. Often accountability took the form of avoidance of overt \n 12\nconflict in recognition that:  \u2026We don't want our local MPs on our back, we don't want \nthe local papers on our back. (A:1) \nOpen meetings were regarded as a minimum form of involvement, but this denoted \ngrowing confidence by boards in their ability to maintain rather than share power: \n\u2026 initially there was a sense of \u2026, you can\u2019t let them have an opportunity to ask \nquestions, then there was the sense that if we do let them have an opportunity to ask \nquestions we would want to know what the questions were in advance.  I know over the \nlast year it has relaxed noticeably as ..people have gained in confidence in their ability to \nbe able to handle these questions (A:2) \n \nThis view of involvement places emphasis on minimising external interference rather \nthan embracing the contribution the public can make to board decisions. It involves an \nimplicit view that participation should be sought only on those issues considered \nappropriate by the boards. It would suggest, at best, a minimal shift in the behaviour of \nthe boards, primarily for the purposes of self-protection. The value of involvement at the \nearliest stage in decision-making was beginning to be recognised but had yet to be \ninfluential in practice: \n\u2026we all realise that, we are becoming more publicly accountable\u2026, and  if we involve \nthe public at a stage when we are making decisions about how we do things then we have \ngone some way towards\u2026 pre-empting that (claims of non-involvement) problem. \n(Locality A:3) \n \n 13\nThe above quotations are not used to suggest that board members are actively \nexclusionary, rather that dominant and accepted ways of thinking about participation can \nrelegate it to a marginal position, as identified in Lukes\u2019 third form of power. PCG boards \nin the two localities were dealing with the requirement to share power. However, real \nbarriers to power sharing were apparent in the unreflective beliefs held about what \nparticipation would contribute. At the same time there was some recognition of the \npublic\u2019s potential to contribute to the definition of a good decision as one influenced by \nparticipation rather than formed through, \u2018specialist Health Service people in darkened \nrooms taking decisions for the population\u2019 (B:3). \n \nIt was, further, suggested that the changing balance of board membership could resolve \nthis issue: \n\u2026there are certain hierarchies within medicine that can cause problems with group \ndynamics on the board.  Hopefully, these will, to some extent, dissolve \u2026as we move to \nPCTs \u2026 they (medical professions) are going to lose a lot of their power anyway.  So the \nlay representation on the board will get much stronger.  (B: 2) \nBased on our analysis of power and the currency of different forms of capital however, \nthere is no necessary relation between a change in the numbers of people represented and \ntheir ability to exercise power. \n \nThe role of the Public \n \n 14\nAs consultation is effectively in the gift of the board, the views taken by members, based \nin the identity they ascribed to the public, is fundamental.  When legitimacy is based in \nthe cultural capital, held in professional knowledge, a restricted form of listening to the \npublic view is justified:  \nNow whether the views of the public will have equal weight to the views of the \nprofessionals about some of these issues I think is debatable really.  Partly ..because the \nargument can always be made \u2026\u2026. (that board members have) more inside information \nand perhaps the public are making decisions, or putting their views forward based on \ninsufficient information.  (Locality A:3) \n \nSome issues were regarded as impossible for \u2018non-professionals\u2019 to grasp, being the \nproper province of professionals, albeit with support from experienced users and carers: \nIn the view of many respondents issues of efficiency were prime and could be best \ndecided on the basis of the authority of knowledge.  \nI think it is a matter of judgement as to what we take to the public and the complexity of \nsome of the issues....  (Locality A:9) \nThe capital relied on was therefore essentially that encompassed by the cultural capital of \nprofessionally qualified and knowledgeable actors supported by a limited role for a public \nunable to comprehend complex issues. \n \nImplicit within the approaches taken are beliefs, not only about the differential levels of \ncultural capital possessed by participants, which concerned the respondents quoted above, \nbut also the symbolic capital with which they are endowed.  For those who characterised \n 15\nthe public as individualised, ignorant or self interested, \u2018people are there for their own \nbenefit\u2019 (B:10), it is appropriate for the PCG to listen but also to retain power in its own \nhands in the interests of the wider populace.  The contrast between a public characterised \nas self-interested and one characterised as a collective of citizens is clear. Each implies \nvery different purposes and methods for participation.  \n \nThe selection of which products of consultation to respond to is also firmly controlled by \nboards. This control of the agenda, which forms the core of Lukes\u2019 second form of \npower, resulted in filtering ideas and suggestions through the lens of professional \ninterests. \n \u2026if patients come up with 23 ideas you will look at them and think 'oh that's a good \nidea'.  So it has to\u2026 marry up with your beliefs\u2026( A:6) \nThe practice of consultation has the potential therefore to be used only in a confirmatory \nway to support dominant views of what is appropriate. \n \nIn both boards the dominant view was that public contributions should focus on the \norganisational aspects of service provision: \nSo I think the public have got an awful lot to offer and they have got to be made aware of \nthe realities of the situation as well - in terms of the resource constraints. \u2026 it\u2019s not \nabout the actual specialist service that they receive, it\u2019s more about the, I was going to \nsay peripheral things but that\u2019s probably the wrong word\u2026.  it\u2019s the times that things are \navailable and how the whole things come together (B:8) \n 16\n The public\u2019s contribution was acknowledged for its ability to comment on service \ndelivery. What was missing from this conception was a view of the public collectively \ninvolved in decision-making as citizens rather than consumers. \n \nA further basis for restricting listening occurs when Boards see themselves as impartially \nadjudicating between interests. Here the PCG, by limiting consultation, can be the \nchampion of the oppressed: \n\u2026 we have got probably a very well informed vocal community who \u2026would probably \nreadily accept the opportunity to feed in where they would like to see things going.  But, \nthe needs out there might be (in a) more deprived community who perhaps haven't got the \nskills to give you, actuall,y the feedback ... (A: 5) \n \nAnother reason for restricting the role of participation lies in the Boards\u2019 claims to be \nproperly exercising an onerous responsibility because: \n we are employed by the health service on reasonably good rates of pay \u2026.to take \ndifficult decisions. (B:1) \nThis perspective is reinforced by the fact that an unlimited demand for resources makes \nweighting participation difficult. \u2018\u2026some of this is actually about managing expectations \n\u2026.   we are not going to be able to throw additional resources at everything the public \ncomes up with.  (B:2) \nThese concerns suggest a somewhat residual view of the role of participation, supported \nby limited pressure for its development: At the moment there is nobody really saying \n'hang on a minute guys, we really need more openness'.   (A:2) \n 17\n Learning Public Views- two approaches to evidence \nIn addition to thinking about the public\u2019s role, perhaps the most revealing evidence of \npower relations lies in what is taken to constitute evidence. We have identified a \nhierarchical approach to knowledge and the fact that powerful groups use such \nknowledge to support their claims to power. In according legitimacy to a public voice, a \nfurther set of processes of hierarchization and exclusion appear. This becomes more \nevident in the processes of involvement than in consideration of its products. \nThe boards adopted different ways of gathering information for consultation reflecting \nsome differences of view about the purpose of consultation and participation. We \nsuggest, in applying the analysis of power and forms of capital presented here, that they \nhave very different potentials for the nature of participation achieved. The objectives and \nmethods adopted in the two approaches can be summarized, on the one hand as seeking a \nrepresentative snapshot of opinion (Locality A), and on the other, of seeking dialogue \nwith a community (Locality B). \n \n \nIn Locality A, the public were being approached primarily through quantitative methods \nof gathering evidence, by the addition of questions to a local authority ratepayers panel. \nConsequently the definitions of issues and the range of possible solutions is determined \nby the board, in keeping with Lukes\u2019 second form of power. The relationship to the \npublic was primarily formal and responsive, based in gathering questionnaire evidence. \nIn this context the claim to the priority of cultural capital was evident. A hierarchy was \n 18\nestablished in which panel evidence was accorded lower value than that of either patients, \nwhose knowledge gave them some capital, or professionals whose claim to knowledge \nwas greatest. The findings presented by Skelcher (1993) in relation to the limited nature \nof involvement in terms of devolution of power are echoed here: \nI suspect that in fact 99% of it (participation) is going to be user\/carer involvement, \nquality monitoring, satisfaction and all that sort of thing. (Locality A:3) \n \nWhile it was recognised that this offered a limited form of involvement, the further \nmeasures being contemplated would centre on checking the validity and reliability of the \npanel view, rather than a means of extending participation: \n\u2026 there may be other ways of checking this out in that in combining the panel views \nwhich are the individual members of the public with the views of groups already \nestablished, support groups and so on, \u2026to see whether the people who have had direct \nexperience of these services are giving the same kinds of views as the public. (A:1) \n \nThe approach that boards adopted to information gathering reflected their understanding \nof who should be consulted together with how that consultation should take place. If \ninvolvement is conceived of as learning about current public opinion, the methods of \nconsultation will privilege neutrality and representativeness. The hierarchical approach to \nevidence, accepted in the medical field, reinforces a belief in the superiority of this \napproach. Data must be gathered without influence, from a sample that is representative \nof the wider population. However the emphasis on neutrality and representativeness can \ntend to privilege methods over substance. Lukes\u2019 second form of power is evident when \n 19\nthe method is more important than the content of consultation responses, limiting agenda \nsetting and excluding some issues from even initial consideration. To the extent that \nexpert knowledge is the currency of cultural capital, the public\u2019s capital must always \nhave less value than that of professionals. In learning the views of a representative public, \nPCG boards can point to the limited information upon which responses are based.  \nIf, however, the opinion of a knowledgeable public is valued, then more deliberative \nforms of consultation are appropriate. The conflict between possession of knowledge and \nrepresentativeness is clear (Harrison and Mort, 1998). We suggest however that these \noppositions represent only one way of thinking about participation. \n \nAchieving interaction with forms of capital, existing within communities, may require \nmore pro-active approaches. In Locality A, radical suggestions for engaging with \ncommunities had met with a lukewarm response: \n\u2026 there was one \u2026.Board Meeting about the homeless and I suggested that we go out to \nwhere the homeless are .. and I didn\u2019t receive a very positive response. \u2026So I withdrew \n\u2026(A:5) \n \nIn Locality B there was some evidence of a different approach emerging, based in \ncommunity development. The PCG had sought to replicate existing community structures \nin its own organisational structure and to interweave its policies with those in the local \nauthority. This had not been uncontested ground. Even in the selection of community \nworkers initial concerns had been about preserving the relations underpinning third form \n 20\nof power: the people that were acceptable to the interviewers alongside me, were people \nwith a strong health service focus who could speak the jargon .. (B:3) \nThis concern had been superseded in favour of selecting a candidate with skills in \ncommunity work. While the approach would not necessarily give rise to a transfer of \npower, the fact that it involved interaction with the public suggests a stronger potential \nrole than even board members were entirely comfortable with:  \nIt\u2019s difficult to envisage a scenario where the public are prioritising issues ...although \n..that\u2019s what community health workers \u2026would be doing.  It\u2019s a way of finding out the \nissues in your patch and getting some prioritisation on that and then feeding back to \nPCGs ... (B:2) \nSuch interaction entails engagement between the cultural capital of professionals and the \nsocial capital of the community.  Recognising a public voice as a citizen voice has \nimplications in terms of allowing for the legitimacy of the collective social capital of the \ncommunity. This is significant because, when dialogue occurs, the opportunities for \nshaping agendas and redefining issues and problems emerge. Boards can no longer \nexercise tight control over the subject matter or the nature of the discussion. Community \nsocial capital has conventionally been excluded from such relationships through the \nindividualization of health care users (Lee and Ozanne, 1999). This relationship at least \naccords that capital  legitimacy, and therefore the potential exists for some shift of power.   \n \nCultural, symbolic and social forms of capital are currently endowed with different levels \nof legitimacy and the claim of powerful managerial and professional groups is to the \ngreater legitimacy of their cultural capital. While some members of both boards \n 21\nconsidered stronger notions of involvement possible, the general view was that \nprofessionals should be the final arbiters. Board members did not see themselves as an \ninterest group, but rather as impartially arbitrating between interests.  The dominance of \ncultural capital has been substantially supported by the ability of professionals in the past \nto exclude the social capital held by communities. The differences between boards \nidentified above does not lie, therefore, so much  in a conscious evaluation of the \nrespective roles of boards, patients and publics as in the opportunities for involvement \nthat their methods presented. \n Discussion \nHistorically the struggle for power in the field of health can be viewed through the lens of \nthe changing legitimacy of forms of capital. The challenge to traditional bases of \nlegitimacy emerged through a reorientation of values in the public services supported by \nre-evaluation of forms of knowledge. In the welfare field, in the immediate post war \nperiod, a consensual value base of trust and reciprocity left traditional, deferential \nrelations between users and professionals unchallenged. In the 1970s the evidence base \nbegan to be recognised as limited, and therefore contestable (Cochrane 1972). This was \nreinforced in the 1980's and 90\u2019s by the adoption of narrowly defined, self-interest \nmodels of human motivation (Le Grand, 1997). Following the introduction of \n\u2018managerialist \u2019 approaches, public policy formation favoured market-based forms of \nprovision with the consequential rise of the consumer (Barnes and Wistow 1994).  The \npost war consensus came under attack from left and right, and from feminist perspectives, \nrecognising a welfare state modelled on an undifferentiated white, male citizen (Lister \n1993, Wilson 1978). More recently the emphasis on a range of stakeholder interests has \n 22\nfurther fragmented the image of a welfare state based on equity and comprehensiveness. \nIn this process, a deferential patient habitus has increasingly been superseded by an \nemphasis on choice (Barnes and Prior, 1996) and professional dominance has been \nchallenged.  \n \nThese shifts have contributed to more fundamental questioning of the social construction \nof knowledge and of the ability of professional agents to act as sole repositories for \nknowledge. When the expert no longer provides the single authoritative voice, services \ncan only be legitimated through recognition of the wide range of interests inherent in the \npolicy process. This implies that knowledge held by patients and the public in defining \ntheir own needs, must be accorded some status. The debate then turns on what level of \nstatus these voices merit and how real are attempts to access and hear them. \n  \nPolicy makers have had a significant impact in changing these relations in the field of \nhealth care, initially through the increasing penetration of market relationships (Barnes \nand Prior 1996), and latterly through the rhetoric of social inclusion and citizenship. \nInvolvement is seen both as a mechanism for creating \u2018active citizenship\u2019 and also of \nintegrating the values underpinning state provision through markets which has \ncharacterised the third way (Giddens, 1998).  \nReturning to our early distinction between publics, patients, citizens and consumers we \npointed to the lack of clarity in policy documents and, not surprisingly, found this \nreflected in our interviews. Yet it is clear from the discussion above that such distinctions \nhave real meaning for claims to exercise power. \n 23\nChanges in the value placed on different types of knowledge and authority, manifest \nthemselves in the relationships between professionals and patients. In the past GPs, in \nparticular, have possessed the necessary cultural and symbolic capital to exercise \nauthority with patients whose habitus was based in deference. While these relations \nremain powerful, they exist in the context of an increasingly generalised distrust of expert \nknowledge and disenchantment with the notions of science and progress which \ncharacterise late modernity. This has meant that the basis of cultural and related symbolic \ncapital held by the expert has been challenged in favour of 'multiple authorities' (Giddens, \n1994).  \n \nThe Relationship Between Power And Participation \n \nUnderstanding relations of power is central to understanding the role that participation \ncan play.  A prime purpose which participation can serve is to legitimise and reinforce \nexisting structures of power. If a single group is dominant, consultation can strengthen its \nuse of symbolic capital, to retain power in its hands. This is evident when professionals \nuse the products of consultation selectively to reinforce their interests, identified \nelsewhere as the deployment of the 'user card' (Mort and Harrison, 1999). GPs have \nbased their authority both on medical knowledge and, through listening, their ability to \nstand proxy for their patients. Evidence suggests however, that the views of professionals \nand patients do not always coincide, (Barnes and Wistow 1994). Accounts which ascribe \nfailure to consult effectively to poor levels of skill and training among the consulted, fail \n 24\nto acknowledge that the ability to articulate a view, while important in itself, may matter \nless than a requirement for the powerful to take that view into account.  \n \nPlacing this understanding in terms of Lukes\u2019 discussion of power and Bourdieu\u2019s \nframework of habitus and field suggests that the second and particularly the third \ndimensions of power are those which have shaped both professionals\u2019 and patients\u2019 \nhabitus. Acceptance of professional knowledge and, therefore, its legitimacy in \npromoting patients\u2019 \u2018real\u2019 interests, depends on the second and third forms of power in \nthe  \u2018operation of dominant values\u2019 and the \u2018socially structured and culturally patterned \nbehaviour of groups\u2019. The questions that arise then are: how far is habitus being redefined \nby the shift in value accorded to different forms of capital? Does the legitimacy of the \nuser and public voice both arise from, and contribute to, the questioning of professional \npower? Does participation serve to provide professionals with another claim to \nlegitimacy or can it actually challenge the distribution of power in the field?  \n \nConsultation has been seen as empowering because of its symbolic importance (Cowen \n1999), but such symbolic gains need to be sustained by a redistribution of power (Barnes, \nHarrison and Wistow, 1994). Consultation can be manipulative in obscuring the exercise \nof power, as suggested in Lukes\u2019 third form. Research demonstrates that the language of \nempowerment may have meanings ranging from a genuine enhancement of participation \nto a cloak adopted by powerful actors to obscure their continuing exercise of power \n(Mayo and Anastacio, 1999). An account of competing interests explains why \n 25\nconsultation frequently becomes, \u201ca 'technocratic veneer' of techniques and tools \u2026 \nsusceptible to audit and inspection\u201d (Sanderson, 2000:338).  \n \nEmpowerment implies not only developing personal capacities, but also extending the \ndegree to which involvement can legitimate change. PCG\/T boards have to consider the \nrole that they think it is appropriate for patients and the public to play, and thus the kinds \nof partnership they should develop. Moreover, the relationship between nationally \ndefined objectives and the degree of local discretion also affects the outcome of \ninvolvement. In addition to evolving notions of participation to meet current \ncircumstances the PCG\/T, as a new organisational form, has the potential to underpin a \nchange in the values underlying primary health care services.  \nWe suggest that in order to \u2018empower\u2019 it is necessary not only to improve social capital \nthrough education and training, as is implied in initiatives toward capacity building, but \nalso to recognise actively the struggle for power inherent in the changing forms of \nlegitimacy held by clinicians, managers and public as citizens.  \nThe notion that people hold capital in several forms is valuable for a number of reasons. \nIdentifying the resources actors deploy illustrates how cultural capital enables highly \neducated actors to interact effectively with their local agencies. It thereby highlights the \nimportance of the relationships established between agencies and those they serve. \nRelationships based primarily on formal communication will tend to exclude those \nwithout high levels of cultural capital. However, while working class communities may \nnot have resources of cultural capital to contribute effectively, they may possess other \nforms of capital, which could provide a basis for a dialogue with professionals. The \n 26\nhistory of exclusion of such groups exemplifies the way in which powerful groups (in this \ncase health professionals) have accorded legitimacy to specific forms of capital. \nQuestioning this dominant understanding lays bare the exercise of power by \nprofessionals, which has previously been represented largely in terms of expert \nknowledge and competence. \nConclusion \nWe set out to examine why participation is so difficult to achieve. The focus of this \ndiscussion has been to identify how the uses of capital and claims to power influence \napproaches to involvement. The starting point was to recognise the significance of how \nparticipation is conceptualised because such definitions \u2018are real in their consequences\u2019. \nIn itself this is an expression of Lukes\u2019 third form of power.   Both the method and the \ncontent of involvement are relevant because each has a separate impact on the scope and \nmeaning of participation. In addition, an alignment can be identified between the \n\u2018hierarchy of evidence\u2019 and a medical model of health, which has extended into the way \nthat participation is enlisted. \n \nHealth is a field in which powerful professional actors are engaging with a changing \nhabitus, resulting from a growing acknowledgement of the status of citizens as actors. \nThis has been driven, in part, by the undermining of professional cultural capital\u2019s claims \nto knowledge and competence and the associated reduction in symbolic capital. At the \nsame time the value placed on the form of knowledge and rights to speak held by patients \nand public, have gained some ground. In this article we have identified the tendency to \n 27\nexalt or devalue the capital held by different categories of participants as a basis for \nclaims to power. \n \nThis study has concentrated on how boards perceived changes in the legitimacy of \ninvolvement and the forms of knowledge underpinning it. This shaped the degree to \nwhich they yielded control or sought to maintain their ground, sometimes by subsuming \nor claiming to act as proxy for the user interest. Here we are describing not only \nconscious attempts to retain power and control of individual actors but a habitus, \nparticularly among medical professionals, which has treated medical knowledge as real \nknowledge, and other forms of knowledge about health as subsidiary. It has traditionally \nlaid claim to knowledge about what individuals and communities need, while \nemphasising individualised relationships between professionals and patients. Further, it is \nclear that the methods of communication used gives rise to different kinds of knowledge, \nwhich in turn reinforces the degree of credence that professionals accord to the voices of \ncommunities. Within the approaches identified, there was divergence between localities \nin the structures for participation employed, Locality A, seeking a snapshot while \nLocality B sought a dialogue. These structures necessarily have an impact on the form of \nknowledge gained and therefore the role participation can play in the day-to-day \ndecisions made by boards. \n \nThe research has led us to several reflections on the processes and relations that operate \nin this field of participation. There was no evidence in our research of overt conflict in \nthe sense that active groups of patients or the public were demanding control of any kind. \n 28\nWhat was evident however, was the potential threat that involvement was regarded as \nposing to rational or disinterested decision-making, suggesting that boards\u2019 (implicitly) \nsubscribe to the zero sum model of power. The adoption of a variable sum model in the \npolicy advice and guidance on public participation sits oddly alongside the model that \nappears to operate in the field. \n \nLukes\u2019 typology identifies the manifestation of power in its three forms. The primary \nmeans of maintaining control, identified in this study, lay in defining agendas so that only \nwhat Lukes described as \u2018safe\u2019 questions were the subject of consultation. A further form \nof power that was evident consisted in limiting the impact of participation through the \noperation of established expectations and practices. These forms of power become \nincreasingly opaque as one moves from overt conflict to the implicit and internalised \nunderstandings, which underpin social patterning.  \n \nSetting this typology within the dynamic context offered by Bourdieu allows an \nexploration of the relationships and processes through which those forms of power are \neffected. Examining unreflective understandings, gives us a clear picture of the \nrelationship between habituses of professionals and patients, which has  been the basis for \nrelations that have pertained in the field. The emergence of citizenship, and the \nrecognition of other forms of capital, present potential challenges to both. The collective \nresponsibility of the citizen gives it a separate and quite different basis for participating \nfrom that of the consumer, and provides a further ground for challenging the existing \ndistribution of power.  \n 29\n Different forms of power are exercised in maintaining control, shaping agendas and in the \nsocially patterned action of groups and institutions and we have used Bourdieu\u2019s \nconception of forms of capital to explicate the process through which these faces of \npower are exercised. We have argued that the structures created to enlist participation are \nlikely to impact on the exercise of the second form of power; embedding dialogue within \ndecision-making suggests that there is greater potential to shape the agenda. Further, this \nembedding could, of itself and over time, have consequences for the operation of \ndominant values that underpin the third face of power. \n \nThe conceptual tools offered by Bourdieu encourage a dynamic understanding of \nprocesses emerging from the interplay (conflict and accommodation) of various forms of \ncapital with the habitus of actors. Approaches to involvement have been viewed in terms \nof the ways that actors in the field seek to maximise their capital and therefore to achieve \npower in decision making. We have looked at two approaches and pointed to potential \npower accorded, or yielded, to the public in each approach based in unexamined values \nwhich underpin more conscious struggles for power. Some differences did emerge that \nare accessible through understanding participation as interaction between forms of \ncapital.  \n The multi-faceted nature of the concept of participation means that the level at which it \nis conducted, its form and content vary, and this research has begun to explore some of \nthe implications of those variations for the power of participants in the local field. We \nacknowledge that this local field sits within a wider regional and national field and that \n 30\nthe redistribution of capital may change power relations between these levels. In order to \nexplore and draw conclusions about that issue however, further empirical research would \nbe needed. \n \n \nReferences \n \nBarnes, M.  (1997) Care Communities and citizens. London.
