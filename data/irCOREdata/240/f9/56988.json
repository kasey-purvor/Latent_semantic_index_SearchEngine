The archaeological importance of the deposits is attested to by 35 \nthe recovery of stone and organic tools, butchered fauna and fossil hominin remains. 36 \nWe combine palaeoecological and geochemical analyses of ostracods from the 37 \ncoastal plain deposits to reconstruct the climate and environment at one period of the 38 \nhominin occupation. The stratigraphy of our study area is indicative of a terrestrial 39 \nenvironment surrounding a small lake or pond. Ostracod assemblages from the pond 40 \nsediments indicate that they were shallow but permanent, and fed by groundwater 41 \nand springwater. However, the species alone cannot confirm that these ponds were 42 \ncompletely fresh. Application of Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) techniques shows that 43 \nsummer temperatures were similar to present-day values and winter temperatures 44 \nwere probably colder, whereas mean annual air temperature was similar to present 45 \nor perhaps slightly cooler. Trace-element and strontium-isotope analyses of 46 \nostracods from the pond sediments support the conclusion that they were fed largely 47 \nby fresh groundwater derived from the chalk, although there may have been a minor 48 \nseawater input. The carbon isotope ratios of the ostracod shells are also consistent 49 \nwith a groundwater source, although they also indicate that the dissolved inorganic 50 \ncarbon most likely did not reach equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide, 51 \nindicating that the ponds had short residence time. The combination of 52 \npalaeotemperature estimates with oxygen-isotope values from ostracod shells 53 \nallowed us to reconstruct the oxygen-isotope ratio of the pondwater, which was close 54 \nto the value of early Middle Pleistocene precipitation at this site. Values were similar 55 \nto present day, suggesting that there may have been a change in seasonality or 56 \nprecipitation source, since the mean air temperatures might have been lower. 57 \n 58 \n1. Introduction 59 \nAn understanding of hominin evolution and distribution requires knowledge of the 60 \nphysical and biotic environment in which each species lived. Although large-scale 61 \nreconstructions using, for example, marine sediments provide a valuable 62 \nenvironmental context for hominin evolution, they must be complemented by smaller-63 \nscale, site-specific environmental investigations from localities close to where the 64 \nhominin remains have been found. Here, we use a novel combination of ostracod-65 \nbased palaeoecological and geochemical data to reconstruct environmental 66 \nconditions at Boxgrove, an important early Palaeolithic site in southern England.  67 \n 68 \nOstracods are microscopic aquatic crustaceans. The occurrence of different ostracod 69 \nspecies is determined by habitat type and by ecological factors such as water 70 \ntemperature and composition (Smith and Horne, 2002). They secrete shells of low-71 \nMg calcite that are often well preserved in Quaternary sediments. Ostracod faunal 72 \nassemblages have been used for palaeoecological reconstructions of past 73 \nenvironment. Moreover their shells have been used in numerous geochemical and 74 \nisotopic studies (Holmes and Chivas, 2002). However, quantitative palaeoecological 75 \nreconstructions have not hitherto been combined with geochemical analyses of 76 \nmaterial from the same site in the approach that we adopt here. 77 \n 78 \nEartham Quarry (50\u02da51\u201952\u201dN, 0\u02da39;06\u201dW), in the Parish of Boxgrove, is located on 79 \nthe northern edge of the West Sussex Coastal Plain in southern England (Fig. 1) 80 \n(Roberts et al., 1994). An interglacial sea-level event towards the end of the early 81 \nMiddle Pleistocene \u2018Cromerian Complex\u2019 (likely Marine Isotope Stage 13) cut a cliff 82 \ninto the Cretaceous Upper Chalk and Palaeogene Reading Beds and London Clay, 83 \nand led to the formation of the Westbourne \u2013 Arundel 40 metre raised beach. During 84 \nthe early Middle Pleistocene, the southerly extension of the Weald \u2013 Artois 85 \nAnticlinorum provided a substantial connection with the European mainland, to the 86 \neast and west of the present Strait of Dover. The early Middle Pleistocene 87 \ntopography on the West Sussex Coastal Plain was also substantially different to that 88 \nof the present day.  A further range of chalk downland was present to the south, 89 \ncomprising the hills of the Portsdown and Littlehampton Anticlines (Fig. 1).  The MIS 90 \n13 marine transgression entered through the gap between the distal ends of the 91 \nanticlinal limbs and led to the formation of a semi-enclosed marine bay (Barnes 92 \n1980), backed at the northern edge by the 40 metre OD Westbourne to Arundel 93 \nRaised Beach (Fig. 1). A massive tibia and two incisors assigned to Homo cf. 94 \nheidelbergensis have been found in association with Lower Palaeolithic stone tools at 95 \nEartham Quarry (Roberts et al., 1994; Pitts and Roberts, 1996). The remains were 96 \nfound in Units 4u (incisors) and 5ac (tibia) of the marine\/freshwater\/terrestrial 97 \nsequence found at area Q1\/B (Table 1). Apart from the hominin remains, human 98 \npresence at the site, indicated by stone tools and butchered bones, is found within all 99 \nthe sedimentary units from which the ostracod samples were taken. On the basis of 100 \nforaminiferal and ostracod assemblages, these sediments are shown to have been 101 \ndeposited in a regressive sea followed by a fully nonmarine setting (Whittaker, 1999). 102 \nThe nonmarine sediments represent a localised landscape of ponds and slow-flowing 103 \nstreams that existed at this part of the abandoned coastal plain, the so-called 'pond 104 \nfacies' in which the hominin remains were found. These freshwater sediments were 105 \nsurrounded by an extensive, coeval, terrestrial landscape, the deposits of which are 106 \nrich in stone tools and other palaeoenvironmental remains. The \u2018pond facies\u2019 contain 107 \nabundant ostracods, Chara oospores, fish remains, slug plates, mammals, birds, 108 \nherpetofauna, and earthworm granules and eggs. We used the rich, well-preserved 109 \nostracod faunas from the pond facies to reconstruct the climatic and hydrological 110 \nenvironment of the coastal plain at the time of hominin occupation. We combined 111 \nostracod faunal assemblage analyses with estimates of air temperature using a 112 \nmutual ostracod temperature range (MOTR) method (Horne, 2007), supported by 113 \nprevious mutual climate range (MCR) reconstructions from herpetofaunas (Sinka, 114 \n1993), with trace-element (Sr\/Ca and Mg\/Ca) and isotope (18O\/16O, 13C\/12C, 87Sr\/86Sr) 115 \nanalyses to address the following questions. (1) What was the source of water 116 \nfeeding the coastal plain ponds? (2) Was the water purely fresh or saline? (3) What 117 \nwas the mean annual and seasonal temperature regime of the coastal plain? 118 \n 119 \nBecause there is no longer an extant waterbody present at or near the coastal plain, 120 \nwe analysed water chemistry and ostracods from small, groundwater-fed ponds at 121 \nGreywell (Hampshire, UK; Fig.1), which lies ~50 km NNW of Boxgrove, for which we 122 \nhave detailed monthly records of ostracod assemblages and water composition over 123 \nan annual cycle (Keatings, 1999; Keatings et al., 2002). The ponds at Greywell lie in 124 \na similar setting to the coastal plain ponds, albeit without any possibility of marine 125 \ninfluence, and thus provide a useful modern analogue. 126 \n 127 \n2. Stratigraphy and palaeoenvironment 128 \nThe standard conformable stratigraphical sequence at Boxgrove consists of the 129 \nnearshore marine sands of the Slindon Sand Member (Unit 3 of the standard 130 \nsequence) overlain by intertidal laminated muds of the Slindon Silt Member, which 131 \nwere laid down in a semi-enclosed marine bay, and finally by terrestrial deposits 132 \n(Table 1).  133 \n 134 \nAt Quarry 1\/B, however, this stratigraphical sequence is significantly altered. Here, 135 \nUnit 3 has been truncated and subjected to pedogenesis and ripening. Locally, a 136 \nlarge, northwest-to-southeast-trending channel and several smaller channels were 137 \ncut into its surface. The main channel, which has a maximum depth of 0.8 m, is 138 \ninfilled with a coarse gravel deposit at the base, containing flint beach pebbles, 139 \nworked flint and bone fragments and an arenaceous, fine component with some 140 \nchalky clay deposition with fine to massive bedding (Figs. 2 and 3, Table 1).  141 \n 142 \nThe channel deposits are completely overlain by Unit 4u, the basal unit of the pond 143 \nsequence, and its associated minor sub-unit 4.4u(s).  Elsewhere, Unit 4u only 144 \npartially covers the Unit 3 surface, although whether this distribution mirrors its 145 \noriginal deposition or is the result of subsequent erosion is unclear.  This unit is a 146 \nmassive silt with rare traces of bedding, although in places a sandier facies Unit 147 \n4u(s), indicating higher energy deposition, has been noted.  Unit 4u is overlain by 148 \nUnit 4, the thickest and most extensive of the pond deposits, which consists of a 149 \nrelatively homogenous, dense, massive silt. This unit has been heavily disturbed by 150 \npore water release deformation structures from dewatering, most especially towards 151 \nits surface.  The upper pond deposits consist of Unit 4d1, a highly calcareous white 152 \nsilt of variable thickness that contains intraformational calcrete nodules. Unit 4d1 is 153 \noverlain by the highly mixed sediments of Unit 5ac, a poorly sorted coarse silt, with 154 \nsubrounded chalk clasts and sand-size quartz grains.  Bedding is occasionally 155 \npresent along with organic laminae similar to, but thinner than, Unit 5a.  The 156 \nsediments of Unit 5ac are a mix of redeposited pond sediments combined with 157 \nupslope colluvial deposits.  Unit 5ac is succeeded by a return to highly calcareous 158 \nspring deposition of Units 4d2 and 4d3, which are in turn overlain by the marker 159 \nhorizon and upper bed of the Slindon Silt Member, Unit 5a.  This bed, between 10 160 \nand 15mm thick has recently been mapped over a distance of 15km, between 161 \nAdsdean and Slindon, by Roberts and Pope (in press).  Unit 5a comprises many 162 \nmicrolaminations of detrital organic material and was deposited in an alder\/fen carr 163 \nenvironment that developed on top of the Slindon Silts.  The colluvial sedimentation 164 \nthat overlies Unit 5a sees a reversion to the standard stratigraphic sequence seen 165 \nelsewhere at Boxgrove.  166 \n 167 \nThe pond sediments described here were deposited under fully interglacial 168 \nconditions, as demonstrated by the taxonomic composition of the mammalian and 169 \nherpetofaunas (Roberts and Parfitt, 1999). The excavated freshwater sediments lie 170 \nsome 50 to 80 metres south of the relict cliff line, with an east \u2013 west dimension of 171 \nabout 100 metres and a south \u2013 north distribution that has been proven, on the basis 172 \nof facies distribution, to be at least 40 metres, but which probably extended to the cliff 173 \nline itself. The locale, which would have been rich in terrestrial and aquatic 174 \nvegetation, was utilised by many elements of the Boxgrove fauna, including 175 \nhominins.  The remains of butchered rhinoceroses, deer and other animals point to it 176 \nbeing a place of food procurement and processing as well as a water source.  The 177 \nwhole of the depositional sequence at Q1\/B from the basal channel deposits up to 178 \nthe surface of Unit 4d3 was time equivalent and thus a chronostratigraphic correlative 179 \nof Unit 4c, the soil bed that developed on the surface of the Slindon Silts after marine 180 \nregression (Table 1) (Roberts and Parfitt 1999). 181 \n 182 \nEvidence of hominin presence at Boxgrove is found within all the major sedimentary 183 \nunits; from the body of the marine Slindon Sand (Unit 3) and the littoral deposits of 184 \nthe raised beach; up through the regressional marine sands silts; the freshwater 185 \ndeposits at Q1\/B; and into the overlying terrestrial sediments.  The archaeological 186 \nsignatures of these hominins are best preserved in the marine Slindon Silts of Unit 187 \n4b; the terrestrial soil horizon of Unit 4c; and at Q1\/B, in the temporal correlatives of 188 \nthe soil horizon \u2013 the freshwater pond facies Units 3c, 3\/4, 4u, 4, 4d1, 5ac, 4d2 and 189 \n4d3 (Table 1).  Hominins were therefore operating at the site under widely differing 190 \nclimatic and environmental regimes, ranging from fully temperate littoral through to 191 \nperiglacial tundra.  Throughout the time of occupation and exploitation the 192 \narchaeological record is dominated by evidence for the collection of flint from the 193 \nactively eroding chalk cliff and the butchery of predominantly large mammals across 194 \nthe temporally changing landscapes in front of the cliff.  The site at Q1\/B differs from 195 \nthe rest of the excavated locales at Boxgrove in that an extended vertical sediment 196 \nstack is present, due to the formation of a large spring-fed freshwater pond or 197 \nwaterhole that was cut into the intertidal muds of the Slindon Silt Member.  198 \nArchaeological remains in the form of lithic and organic artefacts and butchered 199 \nfaunal remains have been recovered from all the freshwater units and suggest that 200 \nthis area was actively used by hominins as both a semi permanent freshwater source 201 \nand fixed hunting locale in the landscape.  The presence of game at the waterhole is 202 \nattested to by the high level of dung derived mineralised organic material at the base 203 \nof the waterhole, and the skeletal remains of both butchered and natural death 204 \nassemblage individuals.  The most comprehensive evidence of butchery is found on 205 \nthe remains of at least five rhinoceroses excavated from the freshwater sediments.  206 \nThe bones of these animals point to accumulation as the result of hunting, as 207 \nbutchery marks indicate first access to the carcasses by hominins and no 208 \npathological evidence for natural death in these prime of life adults and juveniles.  209 \nOther species butchered in the vicinity of the waterhole include giant deer, red deer, 210 \nhorse and bison. 211 \n 212 \nThe environment at the waterhole would have changed through time, becoming 213 \nprogressively more heavily vegetated after marine regression.  The impact of the 214 \nfreshwater seepage would have become immediately apparent after the sea level fell 215 \naway and is shown in the sedimentary record by the main and subsidiary channels 216 \ncut through the Slindon Silt and Sand.  The freshwater body then gradually expanded 217 \nprobably by a combination of channel convergence and increased spring flow, to 218 \nproduce the current mapped disposition of the waterhole\/pond.  The water body then 219 \nproceed to fill up with reworked marine sediments from the upper part of the sands 220 \nand to a greater extent the silts, at the surface of the pond increasing amounts 221 \ncalcareous sedimentation are found in Units 4d1, 4d2 and 4d3.  Early evidence for 222 \nthe influx of slope material into the water body is found in Unit 5ac, although this 223 \ninput is believed to have occurred under very wet rather than cold conditions.  The 224 \nemplacement of cold stage geliflucted and soliflucted sediments began with Unit 6b 225 \nand culminated in the burial of the site by mass movement deposits derived from cliff 226 \ncollapse material and the Downland regolith. 227 \n 228 \n3. Materials and analytical methods 229 \nWe analyzed ostracods from Units 3c, 4u and 4u(s) exposed in Quarry 1\/B (Fig. 3). 230 \nOstracod assemblage analysis, based on presence and absence of species, was 231 \nused to assess the hydrological environment of the coastal plain and the salinity of 232 \nthe ponds. Ostracod identifications were confirmed using descriptions in Meisch 233 \n(2000) and ecological affinities of individual species were obtained from Robinson 234 \n(1998), Griffiths and Holmes (2000) and Meisch (2000). Foraminifera tests found in 235 \nmany of the samples were identified using descriptions in Murray (1979). Well-236 \npreserved adult or A-1 specimens of three ostracod taxa, namely Prionocypris 237 \nzenkeri, Candona neglecta and Ilyocypris gibba\/bradyi were selected for individual 238 \ngeochemical analysis. These species were chosen because they are relatively 239 \nabundant in the Slindon Silts freshwater sediments and two of the genera have been 240 \nthe subject of previous geochemical studies (Ilyocypris: Holmes et al., 1992; 241 \nCandona: von Grafenstein et al., 1999). Any differences in geochemical vital effects 242 \ngenerally occur at the genus level, so our inability to distinguish confidently between 243 \nthe two species of Ilyocypris is unlikely to have had any influence on any of the 244 \ngeochemical values. Specimens lacking signs of dissolution or diagenetic alteration 245 \nwere picked from the dried, coarse (>250 \u00b5m) sediment fraction and cleaned using a 246 \n'0000' paintbrush and high-purity deionised water.  247 \n 248 \nClean ostracod valve material was placed into acid-washed 5ml polypropylene tubes 249 \nand dissolved in 1 ml 0.6M Merck Aristar\u00ae HCl for trace-element analyses. The Ca, 250 \nMg, and Sr contents of the ostracod valves were determined using a JY-70 Plus\u00ae 251 \ninductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) calibrated 252 \nusing multi-element standards prepared with Spectrosol\u00ae standard solutions for ICP.  253 \nThe results were corrected for blank contamination in the solvent acid and for 254 \ninstrumental drift using an external drift monitor. Multiple analyses of an 'in-house' 255 \ncalcite were undertaken to enable comparisons to be made between analyses 256 \nperformed on different occasions and to assess analytical precision.  Based on 257 \nmultiple analyses of this standard, precision was \u00b10.6% RSD (relative standard 258 \ndeviation) for Ca, \u00b10.2% RSD for Mg and \u00b10.4% RSD for Sr.  259 \n 260 \nSamples of between 5 and 7 ostracod shells weighing in total between ~70 and 100 261 \n\u00b5g destined for stable isotope analysis were brush-cleaned and air dried before 262 \nloading into Labco glass Exetainer\u00ae tubes. Oxygen and carbon isotope analyses 263 \nwere made on CO2 produced by reaction with phosphoric acid at 45\u02daC in a 264 \nThermoFisher Gasbench II connected to a Delta V mass spectrometer. Results were 265 \nexpressed in standard \u03b4 units on the VPDB scale with a mean standard deviation of 266 \nmeasurements of 0.12 \u2030 and 0.16 \u2030 for \u03b418O and \u03b413C, respectively.  267 \n 268 \nSamples composed of between 3 and 5 ostracod or foraminiferal specimens for Sr-269 \nisotope analysis were dissolved in dilute (3%) acetic acid.  After centrifuging, the 270 \nsolution was evaporated and the residue converted to chloride with 6M HCl. 271 \nStrontium was separated by standard ion exchange techniques using BioRad\u00ae AG-272 \n50W resin and loaded on rhenium filaments with a TaF activator following the method 273 \nof Birck (1986). Water samples from our modern analogue site at Greywell were 274 \nfiltered in the laboratory through Nalgene\u00ae filtration units fitted with 0.45 \u00b5m nylon 275 \nmembranes.  5 ml aliquots were evaporated and the residue treated with 6M HCl.  276 \nAfter chemical separation involving ion exchange procedures strontium was loaded 277 \non tantalum filaments prepared with phosphoric acid.  Isotope ratio measurements 278 \nwere made on a Finnegan MAT 262\u00ae mass spectrometer run in multidynamic mode.  279 \nThe measured ratios were normalised to a value of 0.710248 for the NBS 987 Sr 280 \nisotope standard.  Replicate determinations (n=66) of North Atlantic seawater 281 \nstandard yielded a 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of 0.709174 \u00b1 0.000023 (2\u03c3).   282 \n 283 \n4. Results and discussion 284 \n4.1. Hydrological environment 285 \nThe samples from the pond facies of Quarry 1\/B contain a low diversity assemblage. 286 \nSpecies present, in order of decreasing abundance, are Candona neglecta, Ilyocypris 287 \ncf. bradyi, Herpetocypris reptans, Prionocypris zenkeri, I. quinculminata, and 288 \nPotamocypris zschokkei. The assemblages show minimal systematic stratigraphical 289 \nor spatial variations within Quarry 1\/B, except locally where they additionally include 290 \nCavernocypris subterraneana. The presence of adults and a range of juvenile moults 291 \nfrom all of the units indicates that the ostracod assemblages are in situ and have not 292 \nbeen subjected to significant post mortem transport (Whatley, 1988). Foraminiferal 293 \ntests were also found in most samples derived from the parent units 4a and 4b, the 294 \nmarine Slindon Silt, suggesting that they were reworked from the marine sediments. 295 \nThe species present, in order of decreasing abundance, are Elphidium williamsoni, 296 \nHaynesina germanica, Ammonia falsobeccarii and Cibicides lobatulus.  297 \n 298 \nThe habitat preferences of the ostracod species (Table 2) indicate that the pond 299 \nfacies overlying the channels were laid down in small, permanent but shallow, ponds 300 \ncut into and redepositing the marine deposits of the coastal plain, probably fed by 301 \nsprings or groundwater seepage and supporting rich aquatic vegetation. The 302 \npresence of aquatic vegetation is confirmed by the abundance of charophyte oogonia 303 \nwithin the sediments. Although all of the ostracod taxa are essentially freshwater 304 \nspecies, those for which information is available can tolerate elevated salinity, up to 305 \nabout 16 \u2030 (Table 2), so the possibility that the coastal plain ponds were slightly 306 \nsaline cannot be ruled out on the basis of the ostracod assemblages alone. The 307 \nforaminfera species found within the pond facies are also highly euryhaline (Murray, 308 \n1979). However, although the ostracods are unlikely to have been transported, as 309 \ndiscussed above, the foraminifera may have been reworked from the regressive 310 \nshallow-marine deposits, from which ostracods are absent. Moreover, unequivocal 311 \nostracod indicators of elevated salinity, such as Cyprideis torosa, Heterocypris salina 312 \nand Candona angulata (e.g. Meisch, 2000), are absent from the ostracod 313 \nassemblages. On balance therefore, the faunal evidence does not suggest that the 314 \nsalinity of the ponds was markedly elevated. 315 \n 316 \n4.2. Air-temperature reconstruction 317 \nAir temperature reconstructions were made using two similar but distinct mutual 318 \nrange methods that have been developed independently for ostracods (Horne, 2007) 319 \nand herptiles (Sinka, 1993).  Both methods are similar in principle to the MCR 320 \ntechnique described for Coleoptera by Atkinson et al. (1986, 1987).  They rely on first 321 \ncalibrating the climatic tolerance ranges of individual species within a two-322 \ndimensional space defined by climate variables, then establishing the degree of 323 \nmutual overlap between all species present in a fossil assemblage (Sinka and 324 \nAtkinson 1999; Horne and Mezquita 2008)  325 \n 326 \nFor ostracods, we estimated past mean annual air temperature (MAAT) as well as 327 \nJuly and January by applying the Mutual Ostracod Temperature Range (MOTR) 328 \nmethod described by Horne (2007). The MAAT ranges of the ostracod species were 329 \ncalculated specifically for this study, using the same GIS and database as Horne & 330 \nMezquita (2008). The MOTR method calibrates each species\u2019 tolerance range for 331 \nmean July temperature and mean January temperature.  These two variables are 332 \ntreated separately, leading to a box-shaped area being identified as the mutual range 333 \non a plot of one against the other (Fig. 4A). Five extant species that could be 334 \nidentified with certainty were utilised in the MOTR air-temperature reconstructions for 335 \nBoxgrove, namely Candona neglecta, Cavernocypris subterraneana, Herpetocypris 336 \nreptans, Potamocypris zschokkei and  Prionocypris zenkeri. Two taxa found in the 337 \ndeposits, Ilyocypris quinculminata and Ilyocypris cf. bradyi, were excluded because 338 \nof extinction and taxonomic uncertainty, respectively. The MOTR yielded palaeo air 339 \ntemperature ranges of +14 to + 20 \u02daC (July) and -4 to +4 \u02daC (January) with a mean 340 \nannual temperature of +5 to 11 \u02daC (Fig. 4B). Present-day (1959-2006 means) 341 \ninstrumental values for nearby Eastbourne are  +17 \u02daC (July), +6 \u02daC (January) and 342 \n+11 \u02daC (mean annual temperature). This indicates MIS-13 summer temperatures for 343 \nBoxgrove similar to present day, while winter and mean annual temperatures may 344 \nhave been similar but could have been significantly colder. 345 \n 346 \nSinka (1993) applied the Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) method of Atkinson et al. 347 \n(1986, 1987) to the Pleistocene herpetofaunas reported for British interglacial 348 \ndeposits, including Boxgrove.  The MCR method differs from the MOTR in that it 349 \nused a different climate data base, and also in that species\u2019 ranges are determined 350 \nwithin a space defined by TMAX, the mean temperature of the warmest calendar 351 \nmonth, and TRANGE, the difference between warmest and coldest months.  Because 352 \nTMAX is close to July mean temperature, and TMAX \u2013 TRANGE = TMIN is close to January 353 \nmean temperature, the results from the two methods should be comparable with one 354 \nanother.  An important difference, however, is that whereas the MOTR method 355 \ncalibrates species with respect to one variable at a time, the herptile MCR approach 356 \nconsiders both climate variables simultaneously.  Consequently the mutual climatic 357 \nrange (MCR) area for Boxgrove herptiles is irregular in shape, in contrast to the 358 \nrectangular area for the ostracod MOTR (Fig.4C). 359 \n 360 \nThe Boxgrove herpetofauna includes the following six species that were used in the 361 \nMCR: Anguis fragilis (Slow worm), Rana temporaria (Common frog), Rana arvalis 362 \n(Moor frog), Bufo bufo (Common toad), Pelobates fuscus (Common spadefoot toad) 363 \nand Triturus vulgaris (Smooth newt) (Holman, 1999). Since the original herpetofaunal 364 \nMCR was constructed, additional species have been identified from the freshwater 365 \nsediments at Boxgrove Q1\/B by the late J.A. Holman: these are Triturus cristatus 366 \n(Crested Newt),Triturus helveticus (Palmate Newt), Rana (ridibunda) sp. 367 \n(Indeterminate European Water Frogs), Pelodytes punctatus (Common Parsley 368 \nFrog), Bufo calamita (Natterjack Toad), Lacerta vivipara (Viviparous Lizard), Natrix 369 \nnatrix (Grass Snake) and Coronella austriaca (Smooth Snake). Although these 370 \nadditional species have not been included in the existing herpetofauna MCR, they 371 \nwould be unlikely to alter the reconstructed temperatures significantly. 372 \n 373 \nThe herptile remains from Boxgrove were recovered mainly from Unit 4C (Holman, 374 \n1999), and therefore lie stratigraphically close to the units from which the ostracods 375 \nwere found. The MCR encompasses a range from 15 to 24 oC for TMAX, -12 to +4 oC 376 \nfor TMIN, and 2 to 13 oC for MAAT.  The present climate for Eastbourne lies outside 377 \nthe MCR (Fig. 4), confirming the result from the MOTR method that the Boxgrove 378 \nclimate during MIS-13 may have had similar summer temperatures to present day, 379 \nbut that the seasonal range was greater and winter temperatures could have been 380 \nsignificantly colder. 381 \n 382 \nA further refinement is to combine the MOTR and MCR ranges to produce estimated 383 \nranges for summer, winter and mean annual air temperatures that are compatible for 384 \nboth groups of organisms.  In Fig. 4C, the ostracod MOTR is superimposed on the 385 \nherptile MCR, using the assumed relationships, July mean temperature \u2248 TMAX, 386 \nJanuary mean temperature \u2248 TMIN and the exact equation, TRANGE = TMAX \u2013 TMIN. 387 \nThe combined range for TMAX is 15 to 20 oC, for TMIN \u20134 to +4 oC and for MAAT 5 to 388 \n12 oC. The effect of combining the two groups is to restrict the distributions of MAAT 389 \nvalues obtained from each individually, markedly compared with the herptile MCR but 390 \nonly slightly compared with the ostracod MOTR. 391 \n 392 \n4.3. Palaeosalinity 393 \nSr\/Ca ratios of un-evaporated waters, such as those of the coastal plain ponds 394 \ninvestigated here, reflect water source. The Sr\/Ca ratio of ostracod shells provides a 395 \nproxy for the Sr\/Ca of the host water, assuming the species-specific partitioning 396 \neffects are known. When sea-water is added to freshwater from a single source, the 397 \nSr\/Ca ratio of the resulting mixture can be described using a simple two-component 398 \nmixing model. It is possible that the Boxgrove Pond waters were just such two-399 \ncomponent mixtures i.e. of chalk-derived shallow groundwater with a small admixture 400 \nof seawater. Because the Sr content of seawater is much greater than that of many 401 \nmeteoric waters, including very-shallow groundwater derived from chalk, the mixing 402 \nline is highly non linear with only a small input of seawater (a few percent) required to 403 \ngenerate a mixture with a \u2018marine\u2019 Sr\/Ca ratio. We have no modern measurements of 404 \nthe Sr\/Ca ratio of shallow groundwater from the Boxgrove area. However, the site 405 \nfrom Greywell provides a useful modern analogue for the meteoric end member of 406 \nthe Boxgrove Pond waters (Keatings, 1999). Here, a series of shallow ponds is fed 407 \nby shallow groundwater passing through Upper Chalk of similar age (Campanian to 408 \nTuronian) and facies to Boxgrove, and these have a Sr\/Cawater ratio of 0.0012 \u00b1 409 \n0.0001. Partitioning of trace elements into ostracod calcite is described by partition or 410 \ndistribution coefficients (KD values), where KD[M] = (M\/Cashell)\/M\/Cawater), where M = 411 \ntrace metal and M\/Ca are atomic ratios. KD[M] values, with certain caveats discussed 412 \nbelow, tend to be constant for ostracod species or even genera. We used KD[Sr] 413 \nvalues of 0.22 for Candona (Keatings, 1999), 0.19 for Prionocypris (Holmes, 414 \nunpublished data) and  0.17 for Ilyocypris (De Deckker, unpublished, in Holmes et 415 \nal., 1992) to calculate Sr\/Ca values for the Boxgrove Pond waters of 0.00174 \u00b1 416 \n0.00043 (1s, n = 16). The inferred Sr\/Cawater values are slightly higher and more 417 \nvariable than those from Greywell, perhaps implying minor intermittent input of 418 \nmarine water to the ponds, although apart from this, the inferred Sr\/Ca values from 419 \nthe Boxgrove Ponds are consistent with a chalk groundwater source. Using a simple 420 \ntwo-component mixing model for seawater (Sr\/Ca = 0.0088, Sr = 7.7 mg l-1) and 421 \nmeteoric water (Sr\/Ca = 0.0012, Sr = 0.3 mg l-1) suggests a seawater percentage in 422 \nthe Boxgrove Pond of about 0.4 %. 423 \n 424 \nThe Sr-isotope values provide an additional tracer for water source, with the added 425 \nadvantage that Sr-isotopes are not fractionated between water and ostracod calcite 426 \n(Reinhardt et al., 1999): the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of ostracod shell is thus the same as the 427 \nratio of the water in which it was formed. The 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of ostracod shells from 428 \nthe Boxgrove Pond sediments is 0.70792 \u00b1 0.00015 (1s) (Table 3), slightly higher 429 \nthan the value for Greywell water (0.70776 \u00b1 0.00001, n = 4). The Sr-isotope values 430 \nof the Boxgrove Ponds can be described using a similar two-component mixing 431 \nmodel as for Sr\/Ca ratios and the 87Sr\/86Sr values also imply a small marine 432 \ninfluence. Uncertainties in the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios in both end members, however, lead to 433 \ncorresponding uncertainties in the mixing model (Fig. 5). The 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of 434 \nseawater may have been slightly lower during MIS13 (e.g. Farrell et al., 1995) 435 \ncompared with present. Moreover, the presence of a marine embayment close to 436 \nBoxgrove may have altered the salinity and Sr isotope composition of seawater in 437 \nthis area at that time, although 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of marine ostracods from the Slindon 438 \nSands (0.70914 \u00b1 0.00003, n = 8: Darbyshire and Holmes in Roberts and Pope, in 439 \npress) are close to modern seawater values, suggesting that this was not the case. 440 \nMoreover, small variations in the composition of seawater end member have 441 \nnegligible influence on the percentage of seawater in the Boxgrove Ponds inferred 442 \nfrom the Sr-isotope mixing model (Fig. 5). Potentially much larger variations in the Sr-443 \nisotope ratio of the groundwater end member arise because the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of the 444 \nCampanian to Santonian age chalk in the area from which the groundwater would 445 \nhave derived Sr varies from about 0.70744 to 0.70774 (McArthur et al., 2001). As 446 \nshown in Fig. 5, taking a best estimate of the Sr-isotope ratio of seawater of 0.70918 447 \nand allowing the composition of meteoric water to vary between the values quoted 448 \nabove generates estimated seawater percentages in the Boxgrove Ponds of 0.7 and 449 \n1.8 %, slightly higher than the percentage calculated from Sr\/Ca ratios. 450 \n 451 \nInterestingly, both the Sr\/Ca and 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of individual ostracod samples from 452 \nthe freshwater sediments show greater variability as well as slightly higher values 453 \nthan those from the site at Greywell, which is unaffected by seawater. This variability 454 \nis further consistent with periodic inputs of seawater, perhaps through very minor 455 \nsurface intrusion or sea spray, or of dried sea-salt aerosols. Despite uncertainties in 456 \nthe figures however, it is clear that the marine influence on salinity was minor. The 457 \nSr-isotope ratios in the foraminfera (0.70909 \u00b1 0.00002, n = 5) (Table 3) are much 458 \nhigher than those in the pond facies ostracods, yet similar to the marine ostracods 459 \nfrom the underlying Slindon sands, suggesting that they calcified in seawater before 460 \nbeing reworked from the underlying regressive shallow-marine facies that predate the 461 \npond facies. 462 \n 463 \n4.4. Carbon isotopes 464 \nThe carbon isotope ratios of ostracods from the freshwater sediments reflect carbon 465 \ncycling within the waterbodies and their catchments. Fractionation of carbon from 466 \ndissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) into ostracod calcite has negligible temperature 467 \ncontrol and appears to be an equilibrium process (Keatings et al, 2002). Assuming 468 \nthe Boxgrove Ponds were largely groundwater fed, the carbon-isotope composition of 469 \nthe DIC would have reflected that of groundwater. Carbon within the groundwater 470 \nwould have been derived from two main sources, namely the Upper Chalk bedrock 471 \nand soil CO2. The Upper Chalk has variable carbon isotope ratios, but values 472 \ntypically lie between about +2 to +3 \u2030 VPDB (Jarvis et al., 2006). The \u03b413C value of 473 \nsoil CO2 lies between -34 and -24 \u2030 in areas of C3 vegetation (Smith and Epstein, 474 \n1971; Deines, 1980). Assuming half of the DIC is derived from each of these two 475 \nsources, the groundwater \u03b413C value would lie somewhere between about -16 and -476 \n10.5 \u2030, and calcite in equilibrium with that DIC would fall between about -15 and -9.5 477 \n\u2030.  478 \n 479 \nTwo additional processes may modify the carbon isotope composition of the DIC. 480 \nFirst, exchange with atmospheric CO2. This is a relatively slow process and complete 481 \nisotopic equilibrium is typically achieved only in water bodies with long residence 482 \ntime. At complete isotopic equilibrium and a water temperature of 8 \u02daC (the estimated 483 \nmean annual temperature at Boxgrove at this time), HCO3- is enriched in 13C by 9.5 484 \n\u2030 compared to CO2 gas (Mook, 1986). Although we do not have measurements of 485 \n\u03b413C values for MIS-13 CO2, a pre-Holocene value of -6.5 \u2030 (Leuenberger et al., 486 \n1992) is probably a reasonable approximation. This would yield a \u03b413C value in DIC 487 \nof +3\u2030 and in carbonate of +4 \u2030. The ostracod values from the Boxgrove Ponds 488 \n(average ~-7.8 \u2030) are much lower than this, suggesting that complete isotopic 489 \nequilibrium with the atmosphere was not achieved, implying that the residence time 490 \nof the ponds was short. Second, addition of 13C-depleted carbon from respiration or 491 \ndecay of aquatic plants will further reduce the \u03b413C of the DIC (Deines, 1980). 492 \nAlthough the presence of Chara remains within the sediments and the ostracod 493 \nfaunal assemblages themselves both testify to the existence of macrophytes within 494 \nthe ponds, the observed \u03b413C values within the ostracod shells can be explained 495 \nalmost entirely by a groundwater source. 496 \n 497 \n4.5. Water isotopes 498 \nThe oxygen-isotope ratios of ostracod shells are controlled by the oxygen-isotope 499 \nratio of the host water, calcification temperature and offsets from oxygen-isotope 500 \nequilibrium (vital offsets), which seem to be constant for individual genera or even 501 \nfamilies. For candonids, the offset is well characterised as +2.2 \u00b1 0.15 \u2030 (von 502 \nGrafenstein et al., 1999). For Prionocypris, the other genus analysed here, there is 503 \nno published offset. However, values for paired analyses in the freshwater sediments 504 \nshow no significant difference compared with Candona (mean difference = -0.05 \u00b1 505 \n0.25, n = 7; Table 3).  We therefore conclude that the vital offsets of both species are 506 \nabout +2.2 \u2030.  We have used a bootstrap technique (Efron and Tibsharini, 1993) to 507 \nestimate the mean of the vital effect for Prionocypris as +2.15 with standard error \u00b1 508 \n0.17 \u2030 (Appendix A). The \u03b418O values for the ostracods from the Boxgrove Pond 509 \nsediments fall within a fairly narrow range of -2.7 \u00b1 0.24 for Candona and -2.8 \u00b1 0.18 510 \nfor Prionocypris, which equate to -4.9 and -5.2 \u2030 for the two species, respectively, at 511 \noxygen-isotope equilibrium. 512 \n 513 \nTo estimate the range of values that these data would imply for a hypothetical calcite 514 \ndeposited in isotopic equilibrium with the pond waters, we first subtract the vital offset 515 \nfor each species.  We again used a bootstrap method, to generate an empirical 516 \ndistribution for \u03b418O of equilibrium calcite, with a mean value of \u20134.93 and standard 517 \nerror of 0.16 \u2030  on the PDB scale. We now use the estimated \u03b418O values of 518 \nequilibrium calcite for Boxgrove Ponds to reconstruct the oxygen-isotope ratio of 519 \nmeteoric precipitation at the site during the early Middle Pleistocene. To produce 520 \nthese reconstructions, we assume that the oxygen-isotope ratio of water in the 521 \nshallow, groundwater-fed ponds with short residence time closely follows the 522 \nweighted mean annual oxygen-isotope composition of local precipitation (Darling et 523 \nal., 2003). The reconstruction of the past water-isotope composition of the Boxgrove 524 \nPonds from the ostracod values requires an estimate of past water temperature, for 525 \nwhich we can use the MOTR- and MCR-derived reconstructions discussed above. 526 \nDespite large differences between the reconstructed summer and winter air 527 \ntemperatures, ponds fed by shallow groundwater often show a small annual water 528 \ntemperature range that approximates the MAAT. At the Greywell site discussed 529 \nabove, for example, mean annual water temperature varied over a narrow range of 530 \nless than 1 \u02daC over a year, compared with air temperatures, which showed a \u00b1 5.5 \u02daC 531 \nstandard deviation over the same period. If the similarity between MAAT and water 532 \ntemperature also prevailed for the Boxgrove Ponds, the MOTR\/MCR reconstructions 533 \nof air temperature should provide a guide to likely water temperatures.  The isotopic 534 \ncomposition of the water itself can then be calculated from the temperature and the 535 \n\u03b418O of equilibrium calcite, using the equation of Kim and O\u2019Neil (1997).  For 536 \nexample, if the MAAT and water temperature were 8\u02daC, then the mean value of \u20134.93 537 \n\u2030 VPDB for \u03b4 18O of calcite at equilibrium would imply a water composition of \u03b418O = 538 \n-6.23 VSMOW. We have again employed a bootstrap re-sampling technique to 539 \ncombine the empirical distribution of \u03b4 18O in equilibrium calcite with the distribution of 540 \nvalues for MAAT implied by the combined ostracod-herptile mutual climatic range 541 \n(Fig. 4).  Fig. 6 illustrates how the distributions of temperature and \u03b418O of calcite are 542 \ncombined to produce an empirical distribution for possible values for \u03b418O of pond 543 \nwater, representing the full range compatible with all the evidence from ostracod \u03b418O 544 \nmeasurements and the MOTR-MCR reconstructions.   545 \n 546 \nVariation in the pond water temperature through the year could impart further 547 \nuncertainty to the reconstructed water isotope values. However, the narrow range of 548 \n\u03b418O ostracod values from across several stratigraphic levels in the freshwater facies 549 \nsupports the contention that conditions were stable both seasonally and between 550 \nyears.  Candona neglecta is a warm-season calcifier and, had water temperatures 551 \nshown seasonal variation, would have reflected spring \u2013 summer temperatures.  552 \nPrionocypris zenkeri in contrast is a year-round calcifier, yet its \u03b418O values are 553 \nsimilar to those for C. neglecta and show no greater variability. This suggests that the 554 \nseasonal temperature range (recorded by P. zenkeri) was no greater than the inter-555 \nannual range of spring-summer temperatures (recorded by C. neglecta), and that 556 \nboth were small. 557 \n 558 \nA final possible influence on the \u03b418O composition of the ponds is marine input, since 559 \nseawater has a higher \u03b418O value than meteoric water. However, a marine 560 \ncontribution of ~2 % to the ponds, the maximum likely content, would only have the 561 \neffect of raising their \u03b418O value by about 0.2 \u2030 and is therefore unlikely to have had 562 \na major influence in modifying freshwater values of a spring to a different composition 563 \nin pond water.  We have incorporated the range of calculated sea water contributions 564 \nto the pond water into our bootstrap calculations (Appendix A), to yield the empirical 565 \ndistribution for \u03b418O in the fresh water component (Fig. 6).  This has mean \u20136.11 and 566 \nstandard error \u00b10.19 \u2030 SMOW and conforms moderately well to a normal 567 \ndistribution (\u03c72 = 17.14 with 9 d.f., p=0.046). 568 \n 569 \nAs discussed above, it is likely that the Boxgrove Ponds were supplied by 570 \ngroundwater from a spring and\/or seepage from the underlying Chalk aquifer.  The 571 \ntopography and structure of the Chalk aquifer precludes groundwater at Boxgrove 572 \nbeing derived from any source apart from local precipitation falling either very close 573 \nto the site itself or onto Chalk hills 100-200 m above sea level, within about 8 km 574 \nnorth of the site.  Thus the fresh water compositions (Fig. 6) reflect palaeo-575 \ngroundwater originally derived from within a restricted area.  In modern Europe 576 \ngenerally, the \u03b418O value of locally derived groundwaters is close to that of average 577 \nor bulk composition of local meteoric precipitation, with only minor offsets between 578 \nthem (Darling, 2004).  The possible Middle Pleistocene thermal climates derived from 579 \nMOTR and MCR in the present study can all be found across western and central 580 \nEurope today, and in this region the differences between groundwaters and averaged 581 \nlocal precipitation are less than 0.5  \u2030 \u03b418O (Rozanski 1985; Darling et al. 2003; 582 \nDarling 2004).  Thus, to a first approximation we may take our reconstructed \u03b418O 583 \nvalues for groundwaters feeding the Boxgrove Ponds to be equivalent to the average 584 \n\u03b418O of local precipitation.  Fig. 6 shows the modern values of \u03b418O in local Chalk 585 \ngroundwater (-6.5 \u2030, based on a contour map in Darling et al., 2003) and in Chalk 586 \ngroundwater and modern precipitation at Wallingford, 85 km north-northwest of 587 \nBoxgrove (-7.20, -7.28 \u2030 respectively; Darling, 2004).  The \u03b418O of palaeo-water in 588 \nthe Boxgrove Ponds was clearly ~1 \u2030 heavier than modern precipitation at 589 \nWallingford, but part of this difference may be due to a modern gradient in \u03b418O 590 \nbetween Wallingford and the south coast of England.  There are no \u03b418O data 591 \navailable for precipitation at any site closer to Boxgrove (Darling and Talbot, 2003) 592 \nbut the contoured difference in modern groundwater values is 0.7 \u2030 heavier at 593 \nBoxgrove than Wallingford.  In terms of the uncertainty of \u00b10.19 \u2030 in the \u03b418O of the 594 \nBoxgrove Pond water, a modern groundwater value of \u20136.5 \u2030 lies two standard 595 \nerrors from the best estimate of \u20136.11 \u2030 , but this comparison takes no account of 596 \nuncertainty in the modern value.  Overall, we draw the conclusion that the average 597 \n\u03b418O of palaeo-precipitation on the south coast of England at the time the Slindon 598 \nSilts were deposited may have been up to ~0.4 \u2030 heavier than modern precipitation, 599 \nbut that this apparent difference is somewhat less than the overall uncertainties 600 \ninvolved.  A stronger conclusion is that the early Middle Pleistocene precipitation was 601 \nnot 18O-depleted compared with modern precipitation. 602 \n 603 \n4.6. Mg\/Ca ratios 604 \nMg partitioning from water into ostracod shells is temperature and species 605 \ndependent, but the temperature dependence of Mg partitioning into the shells of the 606 \nostracod species analysed in this study is not known. However, we can compare the 607 \nMg\/Ca ratios of Candona at Slindon (Mg\/Ca = 0.002) with values in the closely-608 \nrelated species C. candida from Greywell (Mg\/Ca = 0.011, water temperature = 11.8 609 \n\u00b1 0.7 \u02daC). Qualitatively, the results suggest lower water temperatures at Slindon 610 \ncompared with Greywell, consistent with the MOTR air temperature reconstructions 611 \ndiscussed above. However, Mg\/Ca ratios in ostracods are further complicated by 612 \nhighly variable Mg partitioning in water with an Mg\/Ca ratio \u22640.5 (Wansard et al., 613 \n1998). Greywell waters have Mg\/Ca ratio of 0.028 whereas Boxgrove Pond water 614 \nhad unknown Mg\/Ca. Although the latter was largely derived from chalk groundwater, 615 \nas discussed above, the small inputs of marine water may have changed the Mg\/Ca 616 \nratio sufficiently to have had a significant effect on Mg partitioning. Therefore, 617 \nalthough the Mg\/Ca ratios of C. neglecta might imply that calcification temperature 618 \nwas less than 12\u02daC, we cannot be certain of the magnitude of difference in the 619 \nabsence of an independent indicator of Mg\/Cawater. 620 \n 621 \n5. Palaeoenvironmental implications and Conclusions 622 \nOur multiproxy palaeoecological and geochemical data suggest that the landscape at 623 \nBoxgrove, during the time it was occupied by hominins in the early Middle 624 \nPleistocene, supported a small lake or small, shallow, vegetated ponds that were 625 \npermanent, had short residence time and were fed by shallow chalk groundwater, 626 \npossibly from springs. Sedimentological evidence from the pond sediments suggests 627 \nthat climatic cooling occurred sometime after the formation of the deposits that we 628 \ninvestigated in this study, perhaps associated with the downturn at the start of the 629 \nAnglian glaciation (MIS-12). This is consistent with our MOTR reconstructions, which 630 \nsuggest colder winter and mean annual temperatures during the formation of the 631 \npond sediments, although summer temperatures were similar to present. Mg\/Ca 632 \nratios in ostracods provide qualitative evidence for lower water temperatures in the 633 \nBoxgrove Ponds compared with likely modern values, although temperature 634 \ninferences must be viewed with caution since Mg partitioning would also have been 635 \ninfluenced by the water\u2019s Mg\/Ca ratio. 636 \n 637 \nSimilarity between reconstructed oxygen-isotope values for precipitation from the 638 \n\u2018pond facies\u2019 ostracods and present-day values is inconsistent with reduced air 639 \ntemperatures during the early Middle Pleistocene interval that is the focus of our 640 \nstudy. They could be explained by a shift in seasonal precipitation regimes or a 641 \nchange to a vapour source with a contrasting oxygen-isotope ratio compared to 642 \npresent. Ostracod carbon isotope values are consistent with the ponds being mainly 643 \ngroundwater fed and having a short residence time. Sr\/Ca and Sr-isotope ratios in 644 \nostracods from the pond facies confirm the ostracod faunal evidence for the ponds 645 \nbeing freshwater, although there may have been a slightly marine influence, possibly 646 \nfrom windborne sea spray. 647 \n 648 \nThe MCR reconstructions used in this paper have confirmed the data derived from 649 \nother lines of evidence that the freshwater sediments were laid down at the end of a 650 \ntemperate stage.  Although the vertebrate faunas are fully temperate, there are 651 \nindications of increased continentality, as derived from the taxonomic habitat index 652 \n(Roberts and Parfitt 1999), some cryophilic marine invertebrates (Whittaker 1999) 653 \nand the presence of exotic rocks in the sediments of the Slindon Formation (Roberts 654 \nand Pope in press).  Additionally, there is little or no evidence for a hiatus, in the form 655 \nof erosion or weathering profiles at the junction between the temperate and cold 656 \nsediments, in the Boxgrove sequence thus indicating a relatively seamless and rapid 657 \nclimatic transition. 658 \n 659 \nOur data illustrate the potential of combining ostracod geochemical and 660 \npalaeoecological data for quantitative palaeoenvironmental reconstructions and 661 \nprovide information about the environment and climate of the Sussex Coastal Plain at 662 \na time when it was occupied by H. cf. heidelbergensis. Ostracod faunal assemblages 663 \ncan be used to inform on hydrological environment and, in favourable circumstances, 664 \nto make quantitative estimates of past temperature using the MOTR method. Such 665 \nreconstructions should ideally be verified using independent indicators, as we have 666 \ndone in this study using the herpetofauna. Although the reconstructed temperature 667 \nranges are quite large, they can be used to place useful constraints on those 668 \ngeochemical data that require independent estimates of temperature, especially 669 \noxygen isotopes. Mg\/Ca ratios provide an additional palaeothermometer, although 670 \nquantitative reconstructions may be compromised by poor understanding of the 671 \nthermodependence of Mg uptake for individual species as well as complex effects of 672 \nwater Mg\/Ca ratio on Mg partitioning. Sr\/Ca and Sr-isotope ratios provide information 673 \nabout salinity in some circumstances: in coastal localities, this may reflect the 674 \nproportion of marine and meteoric water in a waterbody of mixed source origin. 675 \n 676 \nAcknowledgements 677 \nExcavations at Boxgrove were funded by English Heritage.

Use of Bootstrap and Monte Carlo techniques for propagating 688 \nuncertainties in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions 689 \nPalaeoenvironmental studies generate numerical data belonging to all types, from 690 \nnominal categories through ranked ordinal and interval scales to continuous real 691 \nnumbers.  The uncertainties associated with each element of data take equally varied 692 \nforms.  Expressed forms of uncertainties may range from simple alternative possible 693 \nvalues or states (e.g. \u2018forest\u2019 or \u2018grassland\u2019), through probabilities assigned to these, 694 \nup to full confidence intervals around a value on a ratio scale.  Combining such 695 \ndifferent types of data to form estimated values for new variables, such as 696 \n\u03b418Ofreshwater in this paper, requires an adaptable technique for propagating 697 \nuncertainties.  The Bootstrap, in combination with Monte Carlo sampling methods 698 \nthat are closely related to it, provides the adaptability needed and is easy to 699 \nimplement using spreadsheet computer programs.  Efron and Tibsharini (1993) and 700 \nDavison and Hinckley (1997) provide introductions to bootstrap methods and their 701 \napplication. 702 \n 703 \nThe basic procedure in the Bootstrap technique is random re-sampling with 704 \nreplacement  from a finite data set of n measured values, to generate a new set of n 705 \nvalues known as a bootstrap sample.   Because the random sampling involves 706 \nreplacement, it is usual for some of the n original values to be occur more than once 707 \nin the bootstrap sample.  This process is repeated a large number of times creating N 708 \nbootstrap samples.  Each sample is used to calculate a value for some statistic or 709 \nquantity derived from the original data.  A simple example is to find the mean for the 710 \nn values in each bootstrap sample.  Each calculated value is termed a bootstrap 711 \nreplication of the sample mean.  Repetition generates N bootstrap replications, which 712 \ntogether define an empirical distribution function (e.d.f.) of values for the mean.  713 \nBecause the  e.d.f. is based on the original data, its average value provides a best-714 \nestimate for the mean of the population from which the data itself was a single 715 \nsample.  Furthermore, the standard deviation of the N replicates in the e.d.f. is an 716 \nestimator for the standard error of the population mean. 717 \n 718 \nOur initial application of the Bootstrap to the Slindon Silts provides an example.   We 719 \nmeasured \u03b418O in paired specimens of P.zenkeri and C.neglecta, one pair from each 720 \nof 7 separate sediment samples.  Thus we had seven values for the difference in 721 \n\u03b418O between these species when they calcify their shells under what we assume 722 \nwere identical conditions of temperature and \u03b418Owater.  By sampling randomly and 723 \nwith replacement from the seven values, we created 1000 bootstrap samples and 724 \ncalculated the mean of each.  Thus we obtained an e.d.f. for the mean difference, 725 \nwhich had its own mean \u20130.045 and standard deviation 0.09 \u2030.  These are the best 726 \nestimates of mean and standard error for the inter-species difference in \u03b418O. 727 \n 728 \nThe vital offset of C. neglecta is +2.2 \u00b10.15 \u2030 (i.e. the fractionation of \u03b418O between 729 \nostracod calcite and inorganically-formed calcite at isotopic equilibrium with the host 730 \nwater)  (von Grafenstein et al., 1999).  The vital offset for P. zenkeri is not known, but 731 \nif our assumption is correct that the paired specimens in the Slindon Silts 732 \nexperienced the same temperatures and \u03b418O water, we can estimate it by adding the 733 \ninter-species difference to von Grafenstein\u2019s value for C. neglecta.   Using the mean 734 \nvalues gives an estimate of +2.16 \u2030 for P. zenkeri.  To estimate the uncertainty we 735 \nmust convolute the e.d.f. for the mean inter-species difference with the uncertainty in 736 \nC. neglecta\u2019s vital offset.  We assume that the latter is a normal distribution with 737 \nstandard deviation 0.15 \u2030.  We began by generating 1000 random values from the 738 \nC.neglecta error distribution.  Each of these was paired with a value selected at 739 \nrandom from the bootstrapped e.d.f. for inter-species difference.  The result of adding 740 \ntogether the members of each pair is 1000 estimated values for the vital offset of 741 \nP.zenkeri, i.e. a new e.d.f. for this vital offset.   The mean and standard deviation of 742 \nthis e.d.f. are the best estimate and error for the vital offset of P. zenkeri, +2.16 \u00b1 743 \n0.18 \u2030. 744 \n 745 \nWhile the estimation of uncertainty in the inter-species difference is a simple example 746 \nof the Bootstrap applied to a single variable, the calculation of P. zenkeri\u2019s vital offset 747 \nadds a Monte Carlo approach.  Monte Carlo samples are drawn singly from an e.d.f. 748 \nor from an assumed probability density function (p.d.f.).  In this case, the pairs of 749 \nvalues needed for each replication were drawn respectively from an assumed normal 750 \ndistribution for the C. neglecta vital offset, and from a bootstrapped  e.d.f. for the 751 \ninter-species difference. 752 \n 753 \nWe used a further elaboration of Monte Carlo and Bootstrap procedures in estimating 754 \nthe \u03b418Oequilibrium for calcite formed in isotopic equilibrium with the water that hosted 755 \nthe ostracods.  We have 11 measurements of \u03b418O in C. neglecta and 7 in P. zenkeri.  756 \nWe first adjusted the P. zenkeri values to remove the systematic inter-species 757 \ndifference, then subtracted the vital offset for C. neglecta from the ostracod values of 758 \nboth species.  Bootstrap resampling was used to create 1000 bootstrap samples, 759 \neach of 18 values drawn from the 18 ostracod measurements with replacement.  760 \nPrior to each resampling, the P. zenkeri  values were individually adjusted by adding 761 \na value randomly selected from the e.d.f of mean inter-species difference that had 762 \nbeen previously generated.  By applying this Monte Carlo adjustment before each 763 \nbootstrap replication the ostracod data are adjusted to a common mean, and at the 764 \nsame time the uncertainty in the average difference between species is propagated.  765 \nWe then subtracted from every element of each bootstrap sample an individual  766 \nvalue  for the vital effect of C. neglecta, drawn by Monte Carlo sampling from a 767 \nnormal distribution with von Grafenstein\u2019s mean of +2.2 \u00b1 0.15 \u2030 standard deviation.  768 \nThis step produced a bootstrap sample of 18 values of \u03b418Oequilibrium for a hypothetical 769 \ncalcite formed in isotopic equilibrium with the same water as the ostracods.  770 \nCalculating the mean of these 18 values, and repeating for all 1000 repetitions, 771 \nproduced an e.d.f. for the average \u03b418Oequilibrium, with mean and standard deviation of  772 \n-4.93 \u00b10.16 \u2030 PDB. 773 \n 774 \nTo calculate the \u03b418O of pond water we used the equation of Kim and O\u2019Neil (1997) 775 \nfor the equilibrium fractionation of oxygen isotopes between calcite and water as a 776 \nfunction of temperature,1000.ln\u03b1calcite-H2O = 18\u00b703.1000\/T  -  32\u00b742, with T = 777 \ntemperature (K) and \u03b1calcite-H2O = (1000 + \u03b418Ocalcite)\/(1000 + \u03b418OH2O).  If values for T 778 \nand \u03b418Ocalcite are assumed, the equation can be solved to give \u03b418O H2O.  Preliminary 779 \nconversion of \u03b418Ocalcite from the PDB to the SMOW scale is required, using \u03b418OSMOW 780 \n= 1\u00b703086 \u03b418OPDB + 30.86  (Criss, 1999, p.33). 781 \n 782 \nOur estimates for T come from the combined ostracod-herptile reconstruction of 783 \nMAAT by the MOTR-MCR method.  Figs.4 and 4C of the main paper show that the 784 \ncombined MCR occupies part of a two-dimensional space that is gridded at integer 785 \nvalues of the climate variables on both axes.  The true climate lies within this range 786 \nand we assume that every grid intersection has the same probability of representing 787 \nit, i.e. the attribute \u2018true climate\u2019 has a uniform a priori probability of 1\/G at all 788 \nintersections within and on the boundary of the mutual range, where G is the number 789 \nof such intersections, and a zero probability outside the mutual range.  (This 790 \nassumption has been questioned and various approaches to identifying a \u2018most 791 \nprobable\u2019 value for the climate have been suggested by Atkinson et al. 1987, Sinka 792 \n1993, Dockerty and Lovett 2003, Dockerty et al. 2003, Bray et al. 2006 and Horne 793 \nand Mezquita 2008.  Such modifications rest upon complex and problematic 794 \nassumptions and will not be discussed here.  As far as the Bootstrap-Monte Carlo 795 \nmethodology is concerned, it would be easy to incorporate them.)  The combined 796 \nostracod-herptile MCR (Fig. 4C) has 48 grid intersections, so G = 48, and each 797 \nintersection has an estimated MAAT defined by (TMAX \u2013 TRANGE\/2).  The frequency 798 \ndistribution of MAAT among these 48 cases is shown in Fig. 6B.  Note that because it 799 \nis gridded, MAAT is interval data, so does not possess a continuous uncertainty 800 \ndistribution. 801 \n 802 \nTo generate an e.d.f. for \u03b418Opondwater we adopted a Monte Carlo approach.  A value 803 \nfrom the list of 48 MAATs  was selected at random and combined with a value drawn 804 \nat random from the e.d.f. of \u03b418Oequilibrium already generated.    The pair of values was 805 \nthen used to generate a value for \u03b418Opondwater by inserting MAAT for T and 806 \n\u03b418Oequilibrium for \u03b418Ocalcite in the Kim and O\u2019Neil equation above.  This was repeated 807 \nto create 1000 replications.  As a further part of each replication, allowance was 808 \nmade for the seawater component of the pond water.   Section 4.3 of the main paper 809 \nderives three estimates for the seawater component in the ponds, namely 0.4, 0.7 810 \nand 1.8 %.  We assumed these to each have a probability of 1\/3 and made a random 811 \nselection from them for each replication.  The chosen value was used to calculate the 812 \n\u03b418Ofreshwater of the fresh water component, by assuming simple mixing with sea water 813 \nwith \u03b418Oseawater = 0 \u2030SMOW. 814 \n 815 \nThese procedures gave rise to an e.d.f. for \u03b418Ofreshwater with mean of -6.11 and 816 \nstandard deviation of 0.19 \u2030 SMOW, shown in Fig. 6B of the main paper.  A Chi-817 \nsquare test of fit to a normal distribution gave \u03c72 =17.14 with 9 degrees of freedom, 818 \nindicating a probability of 4.6% that the e.d.f. was a sample drawn from a normal 819 \ndistribution with the same mean and standard deviation.  Thus, the e.d.f. is not a very 820 \nclose fit to a normal curve, despite the visual resemblance in Fig. 6B. 821 \n 822 \nThis detailed example illustrates the adaptability and power of combining Bootstrap 823 \nand Monte Carlo methods to propagate uncertainties from the mixed data types 824 \ncommonly encountered in palaeoenvironmental reconstructions.  The present 825 \nexample has included interval data (sea water percentage, MAAT), ratio data (\u03b418O of 826 \nostracods) and parametric data (vital offset for C. neglecta). A further advantage of 827 \nusing these simple techniques is that implementing them helps the investigator to 828 \nidentify explicitly the assumptions that are being made, and thus to consider their 829 \njustification. 830 \n 831 \nReferences 832 \nAtkinson, T.C., Briffa, K.R.,  Coope, G.R., 1987.

Sensitivity of 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of Boxgrove Pond water to varying proportions of 1047 \nseawater and differing 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of A the marine end member and Bthe 1048 \nmeteoric end member. In A, the 87Sr\/86Sr ratios of the meteoric end member is set to 1049 \n0.70760 and the ratio of the marine end member varied between 0.70905 and 1050 \n0.70915. In B, the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of seawater is set to 0.7091 and the ratio of the 1051 \nmeteoric end member varied between 0.70745 and 0.70775, the likely range of 1052 \nvalues in the upper chalk bedrock from which the shallow groundwater would have 1053 \nderived Sr. In both graphs, the dotted lines link the Sr-isotope ratios of the Boxgrove 1054 \nPond waters, inferred from the ostracod values, with the possible range in proportion 1055 \nof seawater given the variability in end member composition in each case. From 1056 \nthese graphs, it can be seen that the reconstructions of marine input to the ponds are 1057 \nrelatively insensitive to the 87Sr\/86Sr ratio of the marine end member, but much more 1058 \nsensitive to the composition of the meteoric end member 1059 \n 1060 \n 1061 \nFig. 6.
