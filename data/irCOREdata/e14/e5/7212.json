The\nprincipal concern expressed by many critics of ICT in education is the lack of empir-\nical evidence for learning enhancement, and ICT is often seen to do more harm than\nthe good it generates as a consequence of the overheads and associated costs (for\nexample, Oppenheimer, 2003). In higher education, where ICT in teaching and\nlearning is probably more prominent than in any other sector, this degree of scepti-\ncism appears just as strong (for example, Romizowski, 2005). Large-scale moves to\nuse technology to support teaching and learning have been seen to be premised on\npoor assumptions and inaccurate perceptions of public response.\nMany projects such as the UK eUniversity, NYU Online, Scottish Knowledge,\nUniversitas 21 and Global University Alliance, which all developed around e-learning\napplications, have failed to realise their aims and goals, leading many to question the\nquality and capabilities of this form of educational delivery (Garrett, 2004). Like all\nforms of education, there are both good and bad examples in practical settings. The\nquestions many people are looking to answer are: what are the necessary conditions\n*Faculty of Communications and Creative Industries, Edith Cowan University, 2 Bradford St,\nMt Lawley, 6050, Western Australia. Email: r.oliver@ecu.edu.au\n174 R. Oliver\nfor successful e-learning, and can these conditions guarantee that e-learning will be\nsuccessful? Many of these questions have become more important in the current era\nwhere accountability is a key concern in the higher education sector.\nThe quality agenda\nThere is currently a quality agenda running among educational institutions world-\nwide, and within higher education in particular. It is a prominent and mainstream\nactivity that seeks to ensure that there is accountability in the ways in which institu-\ntions go about their daily work. The notion of quality in the delivery of education is\ngenerally contextualised within three possible definitions: quality as value for money,\nquality as fit for purpose of the institution or quality as transforming (Biggs, 2001).\nBiggs (2001) argues that the quality agenda that confronts many in higher educa-\ntion today involves mainly quality assurance processes based on public accountabil-\nity. For example: \n\u25cf accountability to a funding body, for example, the Government;\n\u25cf a desire to improve outcomes;\n\u25cf the prospect of new opportunities;\n\u25cf being able to sustain programmes and activities; and\n\u25cf an ability to demonstrate achievement against stated goals.\nBiggs calls such quality assurance processes retrospective activities, because they look\nback to see what has been done rather than looking forward (prospective) to see what\ncan be done to transform and change educational processes to improve the service\ndelivery.\nThe movement, while worldwide, appears to have grown mainly from activities in\nthe United Kingdom where quality assurance processes have been in place for some\ntime. The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAAHE) in the United\nKingdom describes the aims of quality assurance of teaching and learning in higher\neducation as being to: \n\u25cf contribute, in conjunction with other mechanisms, to the promotion of high qual-\nity and standards in teaching and learning;\n\u25cf provide students, employers and others with reliable and consistent information\nabout quality and standards at each higher education institution (HEI);\n\u25cf ensure that HE programmes are identified where quality or standards are unsatis-\nfactory, as a basis for ensuring rapid action to improve them; provide one means of\nsecuring accountability for the use of public funds received by HEIs (QAAHE,\n2001, p. 2).\nThere is a similar high degree of quality activity in higher education in Australia as a\nconsequence of the actions of the Australian University Quality Agency. This agency,\nacting under the authority of the Commonwealth Government, conducts regular\nquality audits and provides public reports on the quality assurance arrangements of\nself-accrediting higher education institutions in Australia. This quality audit process\nQuality assurance and e-learning 175\nencompasses all aspects of institutions\u2019 activities including, teaching and learning,\nresearch and management, including those activities that involve offshore elements.\nThere is an abundance of literature that describes quality in teaching and learning\nin higher education (for example, Ramsden, 1992; Laurillard, 1993). Quality assur-\nance in this setting is achieved primarily through detailed examinations of the broad\naims and goals across such diverse aspects of the teaching programmes as the curric-\nulum offered, its implementation, assessment processes and student learning\noutcomes. Questions that are fundamental to underpinning an examination of an\norganisation\u2019s teaching and learning practices and outcomes include the following\n(University of Tasmania, 2000): \n\u25cf What quality assurance policies and practices does the institutions have in place or\nin the process of development to assure the quality of its teaching and learning\nperformance?\n\u25cf How effective and how fully deployed are these?\n\u25cf What processes does the institution have to evaluate and monitor the quality of its\noutcomes?\n\u25cf What quality-related indicators does the institution use and why?\n\u25cf What are the institution\u2019s priorities for improvement?\n\u25cf What quality initiatives has the institutions undertaken (since the last review) and\nwhat evidence of improved performance is there?\nAs technology has become increasingly applied in education, its use in the delivery\nof teaching and learning has led many to distinguish this as a discrete educational form,\ncalled e-learning (for example, Stella & Gnanam, 2004). As a teaching and learning\nactivity, e-learning has now been caught up in the quality agenda. Many national\nbodies and organisations have now developed principles, guidelines and benchmarks\nto describe quality in the use of technologies to support flexible learning. For example,\nthe Institute for Higher Education Policy (2000) in the USA describes a series of\nbenchmarks that are argued as essential to ensuring excellence in Internet-based\ndistance learning. Likewise, in the United Kingdom the Quality Assurance Agency\n(QAA) describes a code of practice for the assurance of academic quality and standards\nin the provision of flexible and distributed learning, including e-learning (QAA, 2004).\nE-learning is a form of educational delivery that has become quite prominent in\nuniversities worldwide and an activity that, to all intents and purposes, can now be\nconsidered mainstream. Despite its uptake, however, as with conventional teaching\nin higher education, e-learning is often done well and poorly in different locations\nwithin the same university. One of the main problems with e-learning is that its prac-\ntice has evolved from conventional teaching and learning, and its application tends to\ninvolve variations and copies of face-to-face teaching rather than practices developed\nfrom a \u2018green-field\u2019 approach (for example, Collis & Moonen, 2001). Contemporary\nresearch is continuing to explore e-learning as a discrete activity and to distil factors\nthat influence its success and achievements. There is still uncertainty and doubt\namong many as to what actually constitutes a quality e-learning approach, and it is\nthis question that this paper seeks to explore.\n176 R. Oliver\nQuality and e-learning\nOne of the problems facing those who seek to describe quality in e-learning is under-\nstanding precisely what constitutes e-learning. E-learning occurs in a wide range of\nteaching activities where technology of one form or another is involved. Technology\nnecessarily underpins the administrative functions of most universities and higher\neducation institutions and, for many, the lines between the administration, and the\nconduct, of teaching can be blurred. E-learning takes many forms, and common\ninstantiations in e-learning delivery and approaches include: \n\u25cf flexible learning, technology supports for learning any time, anywhere;\n\u25cf blended learning, varying mixes of technology with conventional learning usually\nin conventional settings; and\n\u25cf online learning, where technology provides the means for the implementation and\ndelivery of learning programmes totally distinct from face-to-face teaching (for\nexample, Fresen, 2005).\nWithin this diverse and broad range of activities, we are now seeing increased levels\nof awareness and concern for the quality of the activities that result. There is a height-\nened level of interest in being able to monitor and review performance and to demon-\nstrate successful outcomes. In catering for the diversity, most exercises in quality\nassurance steer towards the activities with the highest levels of technology use and\ndependence; for example, distance education and online learning (for example, Insti-\ntute for Higher Education Policy, 2000; QAA, 2004). Once parameters have been set\nfor excellence and best practice in this form, the variations that exist among e-learning\nexamples that come from a blended learning or flexible delivery form can still be\nadequately accommodated.\nThe literature that describes successful teaching and learning in online settings\ntypically draws from research that has focused on discrete aspects of e-learning in\nparticular settings. For example, a research project might explore levels of learner\nparticipation in an online discussion. The myriad of research clearly shows that there\nis a large range of activities and outcomes upon which the successful application of e-\nlearning processes depends. In the big picture, these include such aspects as: \n\u25cf the scope and nature of the learning materials;\n\u25cf appropriate selection of the learning design;\n\u25cf the levels of learner engagement;\n\u25cf extent of community development within virtual settings;\n\u25cf scope and level of flexibility of learning;\n\u25cf enhanced learning;\n\u25cf reusability of the resources;\n\u25cf the accessibility of the resources; and\n\u25cf the level of uptake of e-learning among staff (for example, Khan, 1997; Kearsley,\n2005).\nIn an era of increased accountability, it is important for stakeholders in educational\norganisations to be able to demonstrate that their approaches to e-learning are sound\nQuality assurance and e-learning 177\nand effective. They need to be able to demonstrate that they are carry out e-learning\nin a way that is efficient and productive, and they must be able to demonstrate quality\nin the curriculum, the delivery and their teaching and learning approaches.\nAssessing quality\nThere are usually two main ways by which the quality of a process or activity can be\nassessed, through benchmarking or by the specification of standards. Benchmarking\ncompares the performance and outcomes in one setting against that achieved by\nselected others operating in a similar sphere, a process of relativity; whereas the use\nof standards uses criterion-related references to judge performance. Benchmarking\nenables an organisation to see how its performance compares against others. It can\ndemonstrate what is good or poor practice through comparisons against established\nbest practice. It is a process commonly used in industry in which businesses use\nknown leaders as models and targets. The process involves comparing local practices\nagainst known best practice to determine where there is a need to improve. In indus-\ntry, benchmarking systematically uses quality assurance processes to identify exam-\nples of excellence and best practice, and then uses these examples as the standard of\ncomparison (for example, Achtemeir & Simpson, 2005).\nBenchmarking is a difficult process to apply in most university settings. McKinnon\net al. argue that: \nNo area of university life [learning and teaching] is more difficult to benchmark. It is char-\nacteristic of universities that the courses and the approach to teaching them are not stan-\ndard. Courses, even professional courses leading to registration, are rarely, readily or\ndirectly comparable. There will always be diversity. (2000, p. 69)\nE-learning is one activity in university settings where benchmarking processes might\nbe employed to ascertain quality. E-learning comprises discrete and distinct teaching\nand learning elements that can be isolated and identified for benchmarking purposes.\nThere currently exist a number of standards and guidelines that have been developed\nto aid this process (for example, Institute for Higher Education Policy, 2000; Learn-\ning Object Metadata (LOM), 2002; Learning Technology Standards Committee\n(LTSC), 2002; QAA, 2004). At the same time, there has been considerable research\nand development in e-learning and many reports have resulted that showcase exam-\nples of best practice and that can be used as potential benchmarks against which\ncomparisons can be drawn. The difficult aspect in this process is perhaps the steps\nassociated with making judgements concerning the choice of best practice examples,\nwhich might be used as a benchmark example.\nA number of researchers have attempted to provide frameworks that can be used\nto provide overarching models to describe the critical elements of learning settings\nthat can be used to contextualise the factors influencing effective outcomes (for exam-\nple, Sims et al., 2002). Typically the frameworks distinguish four discrete elements; \n\u25cf The curriculum, that which is to be learned. A strong curriculum has relevance to\nthe student and the workplace. It has currency and reflects best practice.\n178 R. Oliver\n\u25cf The learning design, the planned learning environment. An effective learning design\nprovides the forms of learner engagement required to assist the learner to interact\nwith that which has to be learned in meaningful ways.\n\u25cf The learning resources, the course content. Strong course content is accessible and\ncurrent. It provides multiple perspectives and conceptual underpinning.\n\u25cf The delivery processes, supports and scaffolds for learning. A strong delivery process\nsupports the learners, provides contexts for communication and collaboration.\nWithin these four elements, there are examples of best practice that apply to teaching\nand learning in general, and examples that could be considered unique to e-learning.\nSince e-learning is primarily a descriptor of the medium of instruction, descriptions\nof best practice would tend to apply mainly to instantiations of a curriculum and\ncourse, more than the design of the course itself. From the earlier list, this leaves\nlearning designs, learning resources and delivery processes as the elements of e-\nlearning that could form the basis of any benchmarking activity.\nLearning designs for quality e-learning\nThe term learning design (see for example Britain, 2004) describes the deliberate\nlearning activities and processes that a teacher or instructional designer plans into a\nlearning environment to provide the cognitive engagement a learner is deemed to\nrequire in a learning experience, to bring about the required conceptual change asso-\nciated with the planned learning outcomes (Kalantzis & Cope, 2004). Learning\ndesigns may be at the level of a whole subject, subject component or learning resource\n(for example, Hedberg et al., 2002). Boud and Prosser (2002) argue that high-quality\nlearning activities must demonstrate four principles: \n\u25cf Engagement of learners.\n\u25cf Acknowledgement of context.\n\u25cf Challenge for learners.\n\u25cf The involvement of practice.\nE-learning settings across all sectors of education have long been criticised for their\nlimited and shallow learning designs (for example, Mioduser et al., 1999). Typical\nonline courses are usually comprised of comprehensive electronic resource sets and\ninformation with little intentional instructional design aimed at supporting meaning-\nful learning. The most common forms of learning design involve students reading\nscreen-based texts and answering questions designed to promote engagement.\nIn a large study of technology-based learning examples undertaken in Australia\nin 2003, a number of different learning designs supporting quality learning experi-\nences were identified and described and exemplars included into an online data-\nbase (Australian University Standards Committee, 2003). The database was\ndesigned with supporting information and resources to facilitate the implementa-\ntion of the learning designs by teachers in areas beyond their immediate contexts\n(Figure 1). Within this database, quality learning designs are all characterised as\nQuality assurance and e-learning 179\nbeing forms of problem types derived from the work of Jonassen (2000). The\nlearning designs are based on problem solutions of a rule-based, an incident-\nbased, a strategy-based or a role-based form (Oliver et al., 2002).\nFigure 1. ICTs and their role in flexible learning. A repository of high-quality learning designs for e-learning (http:\/\/www.learningdesigns.uow.edu.au) (AUTC , 2003)In choosing a benchmark of best practice for a learning design in e-learning, it is\nimportant to ensure that there is a deliberate form of learning experience supported\nand that the learning experience is well matched to the intended learning outcomes.\nGiven the wide variation in learning outcomes being sought, subjects being covered\nand learning levels being considered, benchmarks for e-learning designs necessarily\nrequire considerable judgement and discernment.\nLearning resources for quality e-learning\nThe learning resources in e-learning settings provide the content and course materials\nthat underpin the conceptual change in the planned learning outcomes. In most e-\nlearning settings there are substantial amounts of course material provided for learn-\ners, and the factors of the materials that influence quality are in most instances the\nsame as those that influence the quality of conventional resource sets. For example: \n\u25cf How well the resources support the planned learning.\n\u25cf The scope of the resources.\n\u25cf The currency of the resources.\n\u25cf Appropriateness of media usage.\n\u25cf The relevance of the resources.\nA growing awareness has emerged of the duplication and proliferation of online\nresources, and much has been written on the topic of reusability as both a design\nFigure 1. ICTs and their role in flexible learning. A repository of high-quality learning designs \nfor e-learning (http:\/\/www.learningdesigns.uow.edu.au) (Australian University Teaching \nCommittee, 2003)\n180 R. Oliver\nand development strategy for online learning materials and as a general approach\nto the use of digital resources for teaching and learning (for example, Downes,\n2000). The reusability of learning resources offers many advantages to all stake-\nholders in the learning process and is now considered an important factor in any e-\nlearning process. There are many benefits to be gained from such stakeholders,\nsuch as: \n\u25cf The administrative and financial agents who can benefit from the potential costs\nsavings associated with reusing and sharing learning resources.\n\u25cf The policy-makers who are interested in the legal and ethical implications of copy-\nright and intellectual property about digital resources.\n\u25cf The instructional designers who can gain from design strategies that facilitate and\nsupport sharing and reuse.\n\u25cf The resource developers who can gain efficiencies and economies of scale from\ndevelopment strategies that ensure interoperability and a capability for use of\nresources beyond the context for which they are designed (for example, Downes,\n2000; Shepherd, 2000).\nThe term learning object is commonly used today when referring to reusable digital\nlearning resources. Many writers, however, find this term distracting and misleading,\nand are very cautious in its use (for example, Friesen, 2003). The IEEE Learning\nTechnology Standards Committee (LTSC, 2005) describes a learning object as any\nentity digital or non-digital that can be used for learning education or training. Much\nof the current work with learning objects is seeking to provide systems and processes\nto enable teachers, when creating e-learning environments, to be able to discover and\nlocate online resources that can be seamlessly incorporated into their learning\nsettings.\nThere has been a huge amount of work undertaken by a number of large organisa-\ntions and groups to facilitate the reusability and interoperability of digital learning\nresources; for example, the work of the IMS Global Learning Consortium,\nAdvanced Distributed Learning, and IEEE. This work appears to be removing many\nof the barriers that have previously limited reuse of learning resources. The work\nbeing done to develop the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) is a\nstrong case in point. SCORM has been developed by the Advanced Distributed\nLearning Initiative and provides a design and development model for learning\nresources that strongly supports reusability and interoperability (Advanced Distrib-\nuted Learning Initiative, 2004). Discovery of stored resources is facilitated by the\nuse of learning object metadata and shared vocabularies to provide descriptors for\nresources that can be used in the discovery process (for example, LOM, 2002;\nLTSC, 2005).\nThere are a growing number of repositories and databases of digital resources built\nand developed to foster the reuse of learning resources. Popular virtual learning envi-\nronments such as WebCT, Blackboard and Desire2Learn all support and encourage\nthe development and use of resources that have been designed with reusability in\nmind, and these tools, plus many others, now provide functionality for the storage\nQuality assurance and e-learning 181\nand retrieval of digital resources. Figure 2 shows the Flexible Learning Toolbox\ndigital repository developed as part of an Australian project involving the large-scale\ndevelopment of e-learning resources for use in the vocational and educational sector.\nThe project explored the design and development strategies needed to support the\nstorage, discover and reuse of digital resources designed for specific settings. Many\nfactors were found to influence the reusability of the resources and guidelines were\nprepared to guide developers and designers seeking these outcomes (Brownfield &\nOliver, 2003).\nFigure 2. The Flexible Learning Toolbox digital repository facilitating the discovery and reuse of learning resources (http:\/\/flexiblelearning.net.au\/search.asp) (FLAG , 2003)There are many factors that contribute to the quality of learning resources and\namong these a significant number are particular to the digital resources that support\ne-learning. In developing benchmarks for the purpose of ascertaining quality, it is\nimportant to ensure that the examples of best practice that are selected as the basis\nfor the benchmarking process are reflective of the contemporary thinking in this area,\nespecially in relation to reusability and interoperability; factors that many universities\nhave yet to adequately deal with.\nSupporting quality e-learning\nThe effectiveness of a student\u2019s e-learning experience depends not only on learning\ndesign and learning resources, but also on the manner in which it is delivered and\nsupported. Learning supports describe the measures and means by which learners\ninteract with systems, peers, mentors and teachers in the learning process. Previ-\nously, many thought that well-designed e-learning settings would facilitate indepen-\ndent learning with little or no need for interaction with others, in the same vein as\ndistance education modes had traditionally operated. Experience and research has\nshown that this is not the case. Students in e-learning settings can derive many\nFigure 2. The Flexible Learning Toolbox digital repository facilitating the discovery and reuse \nof learning resources (http:\/\/flexiblelearning.net.au\/search.asp) (Flexible Learning Advisory \nGroup, 2003)\n182 R. Oliver\nbenefits from well supported learning strategies. They frequently strive for the\ncompany of their co-learners and often they seek the support and involvement of a\ntutor to facilitate and guide their learning experiences. A number of writers argue\nquite strongly that effective learning settings must involve such forms of learner\nsupport as mentoring, modelling, coaching and scaffolding (for example, Dennen,\n2002). Providing these supports in e-learning, settings can be achieved through a\nvariety of means and at many different levels, and has been the focus of considerable\nresearch in recent years (for example, Salmon, 2002).\nThe provision of support mechanisms for students in e-learning settings contrib-\nutes to the learning experience in a number of ways:\n\u25cf It enables learners to establish a sense of belonging and involvement, a sense of\ncommunity, which encourages and motivates participation;\n\u25cf Supports can scaffold learning and help students to undertake and complete activ-\nities and tasks they might not be able to do on their own;\n\u25cf Learning supports in the form of communications and discussions provide oppor-\ntunities for higher-order thinking and conceptual development, often not evident\nin independent learning settings (for example, Brook & Oliver, 2004).\nThe process of benchmarking best practice in the provision of support for e-learn-\ning can be a movable feast. Research is continually discovering and demonstrating\ninnovative technology-facilitated strategies and tools that provide learning opportuni-\nties and enhancements over conventional forms. Figure 3 showcases MarkUp, an\ninnovative tool that assists learners to make meaning from readings. Learners are able\nto post their thoughts and reflections, using \u2018sticky notes\u2019, into an online document\nand to view and share the postings made by others. When use of this tool was inves-\ntigated with learners, the act of marking-up readings in a deliberate fashion and\nFigure 3. MarkUp, an online tool facilitating reading comprehension and shared viewpoints\nQuality assurance and e-learning 183\nreviewing others\u2019 comments was found to provide strong supports for reading\ncomprehension and the development of learners\u2019 metacognitive skills (McMahon &\nOliver, 2003).\nFigure 3. MarkUp, an online tool facilitating reading comprehension and shared viewpointsThere are now many strategies and tools that can be used to support e-learning. All\nvirtual learning environments and courseware management systems provide facilities\nsuch as discussion boards, chatrooms and groupware as a matter of course. The\nquality issue revolves not around whether these tools are available, but the strategies\nand means teachers employ to make effective use of them in the learning setting. Best\npractice in e-learning and all forms of learning involves high levels of deliberate and\nplanned learner support through these means.\nConcluding remarks\nThe presented descriptions of examples of strong practice in e-learning provide some\navenues for those looking to use benchmarking as a means of quality assurance. One\nof the difficulties benchmarking poses for quality assuring learning in higher educa-\ntion (for example, Achtemeir & Simpson, 2005) is the process of describing best prac-\ntice in a way that supports the necessary comparative process. There have been a\nnumber of recent attempts to describe and state standards as an alternative means.\nStandards provide levels of achievement of a benchmark that can be qualitatively or\nquantitatively measured.\nThe use of standards provides a means for the quality and scope of services to\nbe documented and for the provision of such to be monitored against stated\nobjectives. While standards have been applied for many years to business services,\nit is only recently that they have been considered in education and training.\nMcKinnon et al. (2000) provide a detailed discussion of standards as a means for\nquality assuring teaching and learning in higher education, and from this work we\nhave developed a framework that we think can be used as a starting point for\nplanning standards to assist the benchmarking process in quality assuring e-learn-\ning (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. A framework describing quality teaching and learning (Oliver et al., 2005)The teaching and learning framework described in Figure 4 is broad and includes\nmany features that do not specifically relate to e-learning but describe issues needed\nto assure teaching and learning in general. In the framework, e-learning is important\nin both the inputs and processes areas, where the quality of the materials are consid-\nered, as well as the provision of the learning experiences and the assessment of\nlearning. In this paper, a number of quality issues have been discussed in relation to\nbest-practice in e-learning, and these issues have been tied to a discussion of quality\nassurance processes involving benchmarking against these best practices. As more\nand more universities seek to use e-learning as a mode of delivery for their units and\ncourses, and as more and more they are being held accountable for the quality of the\nservices they provide, the need grows for accepted standards and benchmarks against\nwhich performance can be judged.\nThis paper has discussed and described some of the main factors associated with\nquality performance in the provision of e-learning services in higher education and\n184 R. Oliver\nhas provided examples of current practice that exemplify these. The paper has\nhighlighted difficulties associated with quality assuring e-learning given the depth and\nbreadth of the activity, but has demonstrated that there are guiding principles that can\nbe used and there are examples of institutions seeking to explore benchmarking and\nstandards as quality assurance processes for e-learning activities.\nAs institutions across all sectors of education proceed to mainstream e-learning as\nan alternative form of programme delivery, the need for objective measures of qual-\nity will grow. E-learning is an activity that has many costs and makes many\ndemands. It will be important to be able to satisfy stakeholders that the activity is\nFigure 4. A framework describing quality teaching and learning (Oliver et al., 2006)\nQuality assurance and e-learning 185\nproviding the maximum possible return on investment and that further investment\nis warranted. To do this, there is a need to discover and document best practice\nmodels that institutions can use to grow their capabilities and performances, and\nalso that benchmarks against quality can be demonstrated.\nReferences\nAchtemeir, S. & Simpson, R.
