It has been shown that particle motion can be\ninduced by, for example, external optically induced pat-\nterns. Here we describe a new observation of the motion of\ncolloidal particles in a nematic liquid crystal and a local\nisotropic area produced by heating from a laser. We postu-\nlate that the interaction is produced by the gradient of the\norder parameter radially from the isotropic area and theo-\nretically describe this via the flexoelectric effect. However,\nbefore we describe these interactions further, a critical part\nof our work which allows the above effects to be manifest,\nand which distinguishes our work from previous studies, is\nthe fact that we have produced a charged stabilized of\ncolloidal particles in a thermotropic liquid crystal, which\nin itself is a new result. We therefore describe this part of\nour work first.\nA large volume of studies is dedicated to variations of\n\u2018\u2018nematic colloids,\u2019\u2019 where the boundary conditions on\nparticle surface generate long-range distortions and topo-\nlogical defects around them and the nematic-mediated\ninteractions between the particles. A recent review of this\narea can be found in [1]. When a spherically symmetric\nparticle is brought into the nematic medium with its locally\nquadrupolar symmetry, one expects the same nature of\ndeformations around the particle. This is indeed the case\nfor planar director anchoring on the particle surface, with\ntwo boojum singularities at its poles. For strong radial\nanchoring energy W there is sometimes an additional\nsymmetry breaking into a polar configuration with a single\n(\u00011) point defect [2], which arises for larger particles in\norder to reduce the \u2018\u2018Saturn ring\u2019\u2019 energy contained in a\nsingular core of a (\u00011=2) disclination loop [3]. Of course,\nwhen the director anchoring on particle surface is weak,\ni.e., below the characteristic ratio WR=K \u0002 1 with K the\ncurvature elastic constant of a nematic, no topological\nsingularities arise and the director distortion n\u0003x\u0004 always\nretains the natural quadrupolar symmetry [3]. Nematic\ncolloids is an increasingly important area of study, partly\nfor academic reasons, but also due to new application\nprospects such as self-assembly of particles in aligned\nstrings [4] and other aggregation patterns [5,6], and even\nas biological sensors [7,8].\nCharge stabilization in a hydrophobic nematic matrix\nhas never been observed before. Classically, colloid parti-\ncles suspended in a liquid matrix have to be stabilized\nagainst flocculation that occurs when, e.g., hard spheres\ncome into contact and become locked in the primary van\nder Waals potential well. Two main methods are used:\nsteric and charge stabilization. In the first case, a polymer\nbrush is \u2018\u2018grown\u2019\u2019 on the particle surface and in the second,\ncharge can be made to uniformly cover the particle surface\nand the molecules on this surface dissociate. The counter-\nions leave the particles, which now repel each other via\nelectrostatic Coulomb forces. If the liquid has the native\nions and counterions, then a double layer is formed near the\nparticle surface and the range of electrostatic repulsion is\nscreened at distances above the Debye length. All of this is\nvery well known, except that the charge stabilization is\nmeant to work in water; the cases of colloid charge disso-\nciation in the hydrophobic phase are extremely rare [9,10].\nThe work [9] is particularly important since hydroxylated\nsilica spheres were used, similar to our case.\nWe used plain silica particles with natural hydroxyl or\nSi-OH surface groups (Bangs Labs, Fishers, IN; particle\ndiameters 0.98, 2.56, and 4:09 \u0001m; refractive index 1.37\nfor \u0002 \u0002 589 nm) supplied in dry powder. These are clas-\nsical charge-stabilized hydrophilic colloid particles. We\nhave instead dispersed them in typical (hydrophobic) ne-\nmatic liquid crystals: 40-pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (5CB),\nwith Tni\u000536\u0006C and refractive indices no\u00021:53 and ne \u0002\n1:73 at room temperature, and a cyanobiphenyl mixture\nE7 with Tni \u0005 58 \u0006C, obtained from Merck (Darmstadt,\nGermany). An ordinary stirring of particles achieved a\nreasonably stable colloid. We believe this is due to the\nPRL 98, 157801 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending13 APRIL 2007\n0031-9007=07=98(15)=157801(4) 157801-1 \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society\nhigh polarizability of the \u0003 electrons and the large CN\ndipole of cyanobiphenyl: the OH groups on particle surface\ndissociate to some degree in spite of the overall hydro-\nphobic nature of cyanobiphenyls. It is also possible that\nsome surface charges can be due to the absorption of ions.\nMeasurements of electrophoretic mobility add strength to\nour conjecture. First we filled a 500 \u0001m thick, planar cell\nwith water with particles suspended in it. Applying a dc\nvoltage in the plane of the cell, with electrodes 8 mm apart,\nand monitoring the motion of a selected particle close to\nthe center (in depth) of the cell we measured the constant\nvelocity of electrophoretic drift. Then the same experiment\nwas performed with a particle in similar sized unaligned\nliquid-crystal matrix. The results are as follows.\nWater matrix.\u2014The field E\u00020:625 kV=m (5 V), the ve-\nlocity of a 2:56 \u0001m particle was measured as v \u0002\n24 \u0001m=s. For water viscosity \u0004 \u0002 0:001 Pa s we obtain\nthe Stokes drag 6\u0003\u0004Rv \u0005 5:8\u0007 10\u000113 N. Equating this to\nqE we obtain the total (negative) charge on the particle\nq \u0005 9:3\u0007 10\u000116 C, which approximately equals that of\n\b5800e.\nLC matrix.\u2014The field E \u0002 3:75 kV=m (30 V), the\nvelocity of 2:56 \u0001m particle was measured as v \u0002\n0:9 \u0001m=s. For the average 5CB-E7 viscosity \u0004 \u0002\n0:08 Pa s we obtain the Stokes drag 6\u0003\u0004Rv \u0005\n1:7\u0007 10\u000112 N. Equating this to qE we obtain the total\ncharge on the particle q \u0005 4:6\u0007 10\u000116 C, or approxi-\nmately \b2900 electrons. This means the surface coverage\nof \b1:41014e=m2. In physical chemistry it is common to\nexpress the colloid surface charge via the so-called \u0005\npotential [11]; however, we prefer to use the effective\ncharge as this will be essential later in the discussion of\nflexoelectric forces.\nCharge dissociation in a hydrophobic liquid, and the\nresulting stabilization of colloid particles in a matrix of\nnematic LC, is a very unusual finding. We also notice a\nsecond unexpected consequence of double layer formation.\nFigure 1 demonstrates that there are no relevant director\ndistortions around such particles, even the biggest\n4:09 \u0001m diameter ones. This means that the effective\nnematic colloid ratio WR=K ! 0, i.e., that the effective\nanchoring energy W vanishes. This is in great contrast to\nmost previous studies of particles in liquid crystals (where\nsterically stabilized particles were used and various direc-\ntor textures observed). The only explanation we can offer is\nthat the nematic order parameter Q drops to zero near the\nparticle surface (and W \/ Q, of course). This assertion is\ndifficult to test experimentally [but see below, when we do\ntest and exploit the Q\u0003r\u0004 variation in a different experi-\nment]. On the one hand, it is easy to accept because the\nconcentration of effective impurities rapidly rises in the\nionic double layer\u2014its thickness (the Debye length) must\nbe much wider in 5CB than in water because of the much\nlower concentration of counterions. One could have ex-\npected an opposite effect: an increase in Q due to the radial\nlocal electric field in the double layer \u2018\u2018capacitor.\u2019\u2019\nApparently this is not the case. Since these particles do\nnot interact at long distances and do not cost significant\nFrank elastic energy, their dispersion in the LC matrix is\npossible and their aggregation does not occur unless they\nare forced into direct contact (in which case they stick\npermanently, not being sterically stabilized).\nWe now move to our second result which is to induce\nparticle motion by restructuring the nematic matrix. We\nshould first mention that there have been several accounts\nin recent literature of laser-heating induced particle motion\nin liquid crystals [12,13] in which case very short (a few\nmicrons) range interactions were produced by director\ndeformations around the particles and the heated areas\n(\u2018\u2018ghosts\u2019\u2019). Our results are different, both in terms of the\ngeometry of the resulting forces, which are quadrupolar\nand not radial, and our proposed mechanism, which is\nbased on a variation in the order parameter and not the\ndirector.\nWe irradiate the planar LC cell with a focused infrared\n(ir) laser beam to induce a locally overheated spot where\nthe 5CB is in the isotropic phase. The experimental setup is\ntypical for optical tweezing, with a single microscope\nobjective in an inverted microscope configuration. We\nused a \u000750 objective lens with a numerical aperture of\n0.55 (MPlan Apo, Mitutoyo) objective lens. A 1 W\n1064 nm laser beam was expanded to fill the back aperture\nof the objective and focused onto a \b1 \u0001m spot. A second\nobjective was used to illuminate the sample with white\nlight. Crossed polarizers were used so that changes in\nbirefringence could be visualized as shown in Fig. 2(a).\nAround the central bright spot (which is the laser beam)\nthere is an approximately circular zone in which the 5CB\nhas been heated to the isotropic phase (in the steady state of\nheat flux) and there it appears dark between crossed polar-\nizers. This isotropic region (\u2018\u2018bubble\u2019\u2019) is separated from\nthe nematic by a well-defined boundary. We see the char-\nacteristic pattern of Newton colors around a circular iso-\ntropic \u2018\u2018bubble,\u2019\u2019 which are in direct correlation with the\nlocal birefringence \u0001n \/ Q\u0003r\u0004.

Matching the ambient T0 at r \u0002 1 and Tni at the iso-\ntropic boundary, we obtain the decay length \u0006 \u0002 \u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0001D=bp \b\n9 \u0001m and the profile T\u0003r\u0004 \/ K0\u0003r=\u0006\u0004, the solution in terms\nof the Bessel K function of zero order. Mapping T\u0003r\u0004 to the\nwell-documented Q\u0003T\u0004 gives the change of the nematic\norder Q\u0003r\u0004 with distance from the overheated beam spot,\nFig. 2(b), which matches the Newton color map.\nThe main observation is that our charge-stabilized col-\nloid particles experience a force and are driven to move\nwhen an isotropic \u2018\u2018bubble\u2019\u2019 is present in the cell. Impor-\ntantly, the force on the particles is long ranged. The sketch\nin Fig. 3(a) illustrates the trajectories traced by different\nparticles, which started at different distances and orienta-\ntion with respect to the isotropic region. The velocity\ndepends on the distance and the particle size, but in all\ncases we observed an order of magnitude v\b 0:1 \u0001m=s,\nsee Fig. 4.\nHow can we rationalize these observations? Let us first\nof all reiterate the different facts that require simultaneous\nexplanation. (i) When a circular isotropic region is formed\ndue to the steady-state thermal gradient around the over-\nheated beam spot, distant particles experience a force that\nappears to have a quadrupolar symmetry\u2014attraction to-\nwards the bubble along the nematic director axis, repulsion\nfrom the bubble when at 90\u0006 with respect to the director,\nand sideways motion at medium angles \b45\u0006. (ii) When a\ndifferent liquid crystal was used (E7), with a higher clear-\ning temperature so that no isotropic bubble or significant\ncolor rainbow was observed, the particles experienced no\ndetectable long-range force. (iii) When a particle happens\nto be inside the isotropic bubble, in most cases there is no\ndetectable long-range force or induced motion (apart from\nthe ordinary dielectric repulsion very close to the laser\nbeam, since the particles have lower refractive index than\nthe medium). We detected no relevant Soret effect [14] on\nthe length scales involved when particles were dispersed in\nwater. (iv) When observed between crossed polarizers, the\nnematic director around the isotropic bubble appears to\nremain uniform. The same applies to the director field n\u0003x\u0004\naround colloid particles\u2014even if there are director distor-\ntions, their range does not spread far enough from the\nparticle to be detected with our resolution.\nThe fact that we see no distortions even around the large\n\u2018\u2018bubble\u2019\u2019 means that to maintain WR=K \t 1 we must\nhave W ! 0. The only possible explanation for that is an\nextended region of the low nematic order parameter and\nthe associate gradient dQ=dr. The full uniaxial nematic\nordering is described by the traceless second-rank tensor\nQij \u0002 Q\nninj \u0001 13\u0007ij\u000b, which has a principal axis called\nthe nematic director n and a magnitude of order charac-\nterized by the scalar parameter Q. Usually the value of Q is\nconstant (apart from the cores of topological defects), but\nin our case the situation is the opposite. The wide region of\ntemperature gradient ensures a significant and long-range\nvariation Q\u0003r\u0004. The director gradients would cost an addi-\ntional free energy and so matching between the director\nfield outside the \u2018\u2018bubble\u2019\u2019 with its interface is achieved by\nthe variation of Q, while keeping n constant.

Such a force seems to\nbe unexpected, since usually one looks for director gra-\ndients between objects to couple and produce a long-range\ninteraction. There is, however, a physical mechanism that\ncould account for our findings. The flexoelectric effect is a\nproperty of all nematic liquid crystals [15]. Its origin lies in\nthe quadrupolar symmetry breaking described by the order\nparameter Qij and the observation that gradients of this\norder can generate local dielectric polarization [16].\nAlthough the original theory and experiment only looked\nat possible director gradients, the subsequent analysis has\nfirmly established that four independent terms contribute to\nthe local polarization in the distorted nematic [17,18]:\n \nPfl\u0002e1Qndivn\fe3Q\nn\u0007curln\u000b\fe2n\u0003n \rrQ\u0004\fe0rQ:\n(1)\nIn the literature, the pair of terms e0-e2 is often called\n\u2018\u2018order electricity,\u2019\u2019 although there is a unique physical\nmechanism behind all forms of flexoelectricity. If we as-\nsume the director remains uniform at all times, n \u0002 nx,\nthen the two components of flexoelectric polarization be-\ncome:\n Pr \u0002 \u0003e2cos2\b\f e0\u0004dQdr ; P\b \u0002 e2 sin\bcos\b\ndQ\ndr\n: (2)\nWe can already see the quadrupolar symmetry, which is\nillustrated in more detail by a map in Fig. 3(b). In order to\naccount for the force acting on particles we need to recall\nthat they are effectively charged, and are subjected to an\nelectric field, \"0\u0001 \rE \u0002 P, with the principal axis of di-\nelectric susceptibility tensor constant along x. The result-\ning force will naturally reproduce the observed pattern of\nparticle movement. As an example, for the particle aligned\nalong x, particles 1-2-3 in Fig. 2(a):\n F \u0002 q\u0003e2 \f e0\u0004\n\"0\tk\ndQ\ndr\n: (3)\nWhat remains is to determine the value of the order pa-\nrameter gradient dQ=dr. In principle, we could extract its\nvalues from the data in Fig. 2(b). However, a crude esti-\nmate may be obtained by observing that a change \u0001Q\b\n0:3 occurs over a distance \b20 \u0001m, giving jdQ=drj \b\n2\u0007 104 m\u00011. We now can estimate the force acting on\nthe particles. Taking the earlier estimate of charge q and\nusing the literature values for the typical flexoelectric\ncoefficients, ei \b 10 pC=m [17,18], we obtain an attractive\nforce of the order F\b 7 pN. Balancing this against the\nfriction drag 6\u0003\u0004Rv (and ignoring the noncentral aniso-\ntropic nature of nematic drag [19], irrelevant for this esti-\nmate), we obtain the order of magnitude of particle\nvelocity v\b 1:5 \u0001m=s for 2:56 \u0001m diameter particle.\nConsidering approximations involved, especially the fact\nthat jdQ=drj is actually much lower at some distance away\nfrom the \u2018\u2018bubble,\u2019\u2019 this in good agreement with velocity\nmeasurements in Fig. 3.\nAs a side remark, we note that in the analysis of particle\nmotion we did not consider the anisotropy of the viscous\nforce [19]. The trajectory of the motion will be additionally\ncurved due to the resulting \u2018\u2018lift force\u2019\u2019; however, the over-\nall symmetry of the flexoelectric force map and the order of\nmagnitude of velocity remains valid.\nThis research was supported by the EPSRC and the\nEuropean Science Foundation Eurocore-SONS pro-\ngramme\u2014SPANAS.
