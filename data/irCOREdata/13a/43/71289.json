The danger is then that we miss much of what is going on, and \ntheorise these people as subjects in a grid rather than as actors constructing their worlds.  \nWe ask them where they are from, and they answer.  That\u2019s that. But if we attend more \nclosely to the relevance of place in their talk, we see that we keep asking this question, in \none way or another, and they keep answering, in different and complex ways.  \n  Place - 39 \n One of the ways people use place in interaction is as a resource for constructing \nidentity, one\u2019s \u2018meaning in the world\u2019.  Being from here or there can provide ways of \npresenting oneself as like or different from the person one is talking to and other people.  \nEven though we all have to be from somewhere, that somewhere can be presented in \ndifferent ways as the occasion allows. When one says one moved here from the South, or \nbought a semi-detached house, or grew up in Miners\u2019 Estate, or that one lives near \nJunction 18, one is presenting a view of oneself and of the people to whom one is talking, \nin Goffman\u2019s sense, a \u2018line\u2019 for oneself in this interaction (Goffman 1967).  This line is \nthen taken up, or not, by others in the group, as the basis for further talk \u2013 developing the \nstigma, telling a story, supporting an argument.  As the identity of a place is \u2018open and \nprovisional\u2019, so is the place-identity of participants in talk.   Of course, there is more to \nidentity of a place and to place-identity in talk than just naming the place one is from.  \nPlace names may not be used at all, as when a participants gives directions to their home, \nor maps contrasts, distance, and boundaries in categorizing people, or recalls family \nhistory, or talks about daily practices that give a temporal order to space, what Ingold \ncalls the \u2018taskscape\u2019 (2000).  But the simple naming, in response to a question, is a good \nplace to start, because it is naming that opens up the questions about the place of place in \nthis particular interaction. \n \n I have argued that social research often assumes the relevance of the Geographical \nformulation rather than the Relational, building rather than dwelling, our pre-existing map \nof the world rather than the paths presented by participants.  We make these assumptions \nbecause we want to get past the routine introductions to what they have to say about the \n  Place - 38 \nformulation of place being problematic.  Schegloff shows how insertion sequences also \nbring out the problems of reference and scale, as participant or researcher tries to define \nwhat kind of answer is right here.  And I have looked at re-placing after the introductions, \nwhere an alternative place is invoked as relevant in one way or another to the on-going \ntalk, for instance as a basis for a story or as entitlement to a position in an argument.  If \nwe take place naming as automatic, without the hesitation or the insertion sequence \nsequences, without the later revisions, we miss the ways place can be used. \n \n I noted in my introduction a range of research that deals with different meanings \nof place.  As Doreen Massey puts it, \u2018\u2018the identity of a place\u2019 is much more open and \nprovisional than most discussions allow\u2019 (1994: 168).  And it is richer, because it is not \njust a position in space, but also a link to tasks, practices, everyday life.  Social \nresearchers can try to close off some of these meanings by restricting place references to \nlocations in space:  a set of place names, postal codes, even pointing to a map.  Or they \ncan make place the explicit topic and ask further questions about how long participants \nhave lived there and whether they identify with the community, town, or region \npresupposing names, boundaries, and meanings of places for this research.   These two \napproaches, pinning place down or making it explicit, still miss the \u2018Yes I am from here \nbut . . .\u2019 responses.  So they miss the ways place names are used to open up talk about \nsomething else.  Relational formulations are shifting and may seem vague, but they can \nlead us on to the categories and practices relevant to these people for this situation.   \n \n  Place - 37 \nterms of whether they \u2018belong\u2019.  Lauren has claimed the social club and the \nneighbourhood as part of her own identity;  having lived there (not just knowing about it) \ngives her entitlement to speak this way.  The same sort of entitlement might be gained by \nparticipants referring to the location of their house, or their trip to work, or where family \nmembers live, or even where they\u2019ve had a holiday.   \nPLACE, TALK AND RESEARCH \nWe have seen that the question \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 is typically treated in focus groups \nas routine, by both the questioner and the answerer.  Researchers seldom notice the \nflexibility in possible responses, and the differences in meanings between the choices.  \nBut if we attend to these routines, and the variations from them, we can see the ways \npeople construct places and identities as they negotiate the \u2018right\u2019 responses for this \nsituation, for what they see as the audience, their role for present purposes, and the \nrelevance to the on-going interaction.   \n \n I started my review of place formulations with Schegloff\u2019s (1972) distinction \nbetween Geographical and Relational ways of referring to place.  My study suggests \nresearchers would benefit from leaving room for the flexibility of place formulations to \nemerge.  Surveys that simply ask for an address miss the richness that more open \nresponses can have.  But so do interviews and focus groups that leave the opening \nidentification of place as part of routine introductory exchanges, because, as we have \nseen, many of the relevant aspects of place emerge only when this exchange is disrupted \nor the answers reformulated.  The hesitations and self-interruptions are often cues to the \n  Place - 36 \n[yes] and that doesn't seem to happen  \nMod yes comple:tely \nLauren: yeah I mean I've got a si- similar example is when I was . a teenager . my \nfather was a miner and we lived on . what is now- is still today is called the \nMiners Estate [mm] and everybody knew everybody [mm] more or less . or \nat least there was a connection [mm] through parents [mm] there was also a \nsocial club that allowed children [mm] they had a children's room and . you \nknow . you could go in and there was a lot of mixing [mm] in that way . that- \nthat's what's missing from where I am now [mm h] now whether that's to do \nwith me [mm] or to do with how the world's moved on or the community \nthat I'm in [mm] I don't know [yeah] but certainly \/it's a lot different now  \nMod \/ yeah yeah yes . I mean do people feel like they belong anywhere \n \nAs with the previous example of the two men who moved from Scotland, one story builds \non another;  Lauren presents hers as \u2018a similar example\u2019.  But there is also a contrast in \nthe way she tells it.  While Terry talks about \u2018everybody on the [unnamed] street\u2019, Lauren \nspecifies a working-class neighbourhood exactly, with the name (one descriptive, now \nevocative of the past). She then leads us gradually into this place, from the estate, to the \nsocial club, back to the children\u2019s room.  It is an artful account the enacts the sense of \nbeing enclosed in this world.  The contrast with her present world is also artfully \nconstructed;  \u2018that\u2019 referring generally to this whole account, is what is missing, and it is \nmissing because she in particular has changed, or the \u2018whole world\u2019 has changed, or she \nhas moved.  She then signals the end of her account \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 with a summary of her \npoint.   The Moderator formulates her point in a question to other participants, now in \n  Place - 35 \ninteractively, in relation to the moderator\u2019s questions and the prompting and previous \nturns of other participants. \nPlaces and entitlement \nSome of the examples of use of place as indications of identities and as openings for story \nsuggest a more general function:  where one is from can be used to show one is entitled to \nan opinion (Dixon and Durrheim 2000).  Participants in these groups are very cautious \nabout asserting opinions, particularly where they might lead to disagreement (Strauss \n2004).  Being from a place not only provides evidence, it warrants the speaker as entitled \nto have a view.  So a participant might say she once lived near the Sellafield nuclear \nreprocessing plant, to support her claim to speak in favor of the plant, or another might \nsay he grew up on a farm, to support his point about BSE (for these examples, see Myers \n2004, Chapter 8).  \n \n Alternative places to be from are most frequently invoked as a comparison to the \nplace currently under discussion, for instance the place one lives now.  Here a participant \nis arguing that communities in the past used to be closer, and another participant chimes \nin with the example of where she used to live.  (I\u2019ve incorporated the moderator\u2019s \ncontinuers into the turns, because they are so much a part of the rhythm). \n21.769 \nTerry . . . I mean even beyond work [ye:s] it's not like . I don't know . 30 years ago \n. like when my father was working you know . he knew everybody on the \nstreet 'cause they all worked at the same factory [mm] that he worked at \n  Place - 34 \nkids have gone we've built a small house the buggers can't come back<  \n9. Bill: so could I ask the question  would you have moved if you hadn't been \npushed  . by your wife  \n10. Stan um I\/ \n11. Bill: \/did you miss your original area where you came from \n  \nThe descriptions - \u2018a corporation flat on Moor Lane\u2019, \u2018a North British Housing \nCorporation house\u2019, \u2018a big terraced house\u2019, \u2018a 3 bedroomed semi-detached\u2019 - are all \nspecific to this culture and this location, but we as outsiders do not need a separate gloss \nto follow the narrative.  It is clear from the sequence in which he presents them that they \nare to be taken as a story of moving up in the world.  The artful shaping of the story as a \nprogress is clear when he speeds up at the surprise ending saying they \u2018progressed down\u2019 \nto the bungalow, something smaller but appropriate for them just because there is now no \nroom for the kinds.  His hearers are to recognize this implication (problems of grown \nchildren moving back in) as they recognize the other stages of his life.  Bill then asks him \nto relate this story back to the issue raised by Mike, the effects of people moving on from \nlocal communities. \n \n\u2018I\u2019m not going to give you my life\u2019s history\u2019.  In both these examples, sketch out \ntheir lives over time in highly economical ways, carefully oriented to this group, by \ntracing their movements between places. These stories not only evaluate the places, they \nuse the shared evaluations of the places to make a claim for the person in this group, to \nshow how they are now different from what they once were.  And they do this \n  Place - 33 \ngreat deal.  Here Stan says he is \u2018not going to give you my life\u2019s history\u2019, but that is just \nwhat he does, in a sequence of descriptions of dwellings rich in associations for his \naudience.  This list follows Mike\u2019s assertion that the problem with working-class \ncommunities now is that people are just \u2018moving through\u2019 without commitment to the \nneighbourhood. \n24.8  \n1. Mike: . . .but when they're moving through they don't care whether the place \nburns down or . you know .  \n2. ? yeah \n3. Mike: as long as their doors are locked and  \n4. ? yeah \n5. Mike: they they isolate themselves \n6. Stan: I'm not going to give you my life\u2019s history but \n7. Mod: yeah \n8. Stan: I started off in um in a . a corporation flat . on Moor Lane and within 10 \nmonths of living in that flat my wife . uh >I'd been married previous and \nI was widowed with 2 children< she said I'm getting out of here and \nwithin 10 months we scraped and scrimped to buy . a  . North British \nHousing Corporation house which is a . like housing unit and from there \nwe moved to a big terraced house and then from there to a . a 3 \nbedroomed um . semi-detached with a garden at the front and the back . \nand from there we've progressed down to a 2 bedroomed bungalow >the \n  Place - 32 \nThe stories are built collaboratively by the two participants.  As in other examples, the \nmoderator\u2019s continuers (3, 5, 7) suggest that the answer could be continued and \ndeveloped.  Drumchapel  (6) is a northwest Glasgow neighbourhood of concentrated \npublic housing, not at all a \u2018quiet fishing village on the Clyde\u2019.  So he is not saying he is \nof traditional fishing stock;  he is staying he is from a tough neighbourhood, and that he \nexpects at least some of his listeners recognize this.  How do we know this, if we don\u2019t \nknow Glasgow?  The laughability of the description is perhaps signaled in Johnny\u2019s \nspeeded up description (5);  it is taken up by other participants (8), and finally by the \nmoderator (10).  Jack has broken in to say he knows the place (and thus recognizes the \njoke, though he does not say so).  Then Johnny continues his narrative, ending it, \u2018that\u2019s \nit\u2019 (19), all one needs to know.  In this and in other groups, one story leads to another, in a \nseries.  In 26 and 28 the moderator tries to close off Jack\u2019s narrative, but Jack continues to \nadd details;   participants are not done until they have signaled the ways the story is \nrelevant and the parallels to the previous story are drawn out. (Nessa Wolfson (1976) has \nnoted that this kind of explicit motivation may be especially characteristic of stories in \ninterviews). The moderator ends by formulating the point of Jack\u2019s story;  he is now \nhappy to be here rather than in Glasgow.   \n \n The anthropologist Karen I. Blu tells how she had to learn to stop ignoring the \nlong lists of places her informants gave her.  \u2018Place names abounded in Lumbee \nconversation.  But they were bits of stories or news or reports of political activities that I \nusually skipped over or read \u201cthrough\u201d in my eagerness for what I imagined were the \n\u201cmeatier\u201d parts\u2019 (Blu 1996: 201).  Similarly in my data, a bare list of places can convey a \n  Place - 31 \n11. Ja: \/I live in- I come from East Kilbride myself \n12. Mod: oh . right so \n13. Jo: moved down here for work \n14. Mod: yeah \n15. Jo: there was no work up there? moved down \n16. Mod: yeah \n17. Jo: met a . girl down here married her \n18. Mod: right \n19. Ji: (   )  that\u2019s it \n20. Mod: OK . thanks very much Johnny \n21. Ja: I'm Jack Wilson   \n22. Mod: Jack OK? \n23. Ja: I moved down here September 1975   \n24. Mod: right \n25. Ja: I was on the run from the army . I went AWOL . that\u2019s how I come to \nget down here \n26. Mod: right . OK? and a \n27. Ja: and married a Lancashire lass as well   \n28. Mod: right \n29. Ja: still married \n30. Mod: so you\u2019re quite happy you moved then \n31. Ja: yeah \n \n  Place - 30 \nkey point for our purposes is that narratives are offered and taken as such by participants \nin the conversation, with signals of when a story is being told, when it is over, and how it \nis relevant to the ongoing conversation (e. g., Johnstone 1990; Sacks 1992; Eggins and \nSlade 1997; Thornborrow 2001).  Stories give the chance for one participant to hold the \nfloor, but they are inherently interactive, depending on a constant stream of responses by \nthe Moderator and other participants, signaling how they are taking each stage of new \ninformation. \n \n In this passage, the moderator asks when they moved to their town, but both \nparticipants take it as a question about why they moved.    \n42 \n1. Mod: perhaps if I could ask you to . just sort of briefly just say who you are . \nwhere you come from . a:nd perhaps . you know .  when- when you \nmoved to where you live now \n2. Jo: OK I\u2019ll kick off .  I\u2019m Johnny   \n3. Mod: OK \n4. Jo: been in Preston for 6 years \n5. Mod: mm \n6. Jo: moved from Drumchapel  >quiet little fishing village on the Clyde< \n7. Mod: ok\/ \n8. M \/ h h h  \n9. Ja: \/I know it  \n10. Mod: you know it \/ h h \n  Place - 29 \nthe person or the rest of the group;  it is seen as an occasion for response, for mitigating \nwork, or for elaboration.  There is apparently no equivalent with positive place-identities, \nthough there are other ways these identities can occasion further talk. \nRELEVANCE \n We have seen that participants choose place formulations that seem to be relevant \nto what has been said so far (\u2018just off junction eighteen\u2019; \u2018I\u2019m really a Brummie\u2019; \u2018I farm \nat Parkfoot Farm\u2019).  Place formulations can also set up further talk as relevant, for \ninstance affiliating or disaffiliating from a stigmatized place.  When participants re-define \nthe place they are from, later in the group, it often sets up a story or enables them to claim \nentitlement to a position in an argument.  \nPlaces and stories \n Places are tied up in narratives:  landscapes are constructed in moving through \nplaces (Ingold 2000), place meanings can be given in stories (Basso 1996), and mention \nof a place can cue a story.  As we have seen, explaining where one lives may involve \nnarratives, to say why one is there, how one got there, what sort of place it is.  So, for \ninstance, when people ask where I\u2019m from, meaning that I cannot be from Lancaster, it is \noften a prelude to asking how I got here, and perhaps exchanging their stories of going to \nwhere I am from, or of coming to Lancaster as outsiders themselves.  There has been a \ngreat deal of work on conversational narratives (for examples and references, see Polanyi \n1985; Schiffrin 1996; Ochs 1997; Schegloff 1997).  Ochs gives as a necessary but not \nsufficient condition that \u2018all narratives depict a temporal transition from one state of \nevents to another\u2019 (Ochs 1997: 189).  One can elaborate the structural definition, but the \n  Place - 28 \n7. James put the lights off and see if his head glows  \n8. M h h h  \n9. Bob then again prior to that you know they didn't have much of a- life in any \ncase (down in the pits) silicosis in any case  \n10. James h h  \n11. Bob so: . all you've done is replace one pollutant with another \n \nJames is using the place as an example of environmental damage, but nothing in turn 3 \nexplicitly stigmatizes the people who live there.  Only when Simon repeats that it is his \nhome town does James makes the stigma explicit, in joking form.  People (or sheep) who \nlive near nuclear or chemical plants are often said, in these groups, to \u2018glow in the dark\u2019.  \n(Waterton and Wynne give a similar example where people living near the Sellafield \nnuclear processing plant say jokingly that \u2018we probably er, glow\u2019 (1999: 140)). The joking \nboth exaggerates and mitigates the ascription of stigma to the people;  mitigates \napparently by exaggerating (the mockery is not meant seriously since he does not in fact \nglow).  Bob goes on to develop the idea of the place and its people as stigmatized (10), as \nothers, including the moderator, laugh.  But Simon did consider it important enough to \nmake sure that James heard that he was from there, before James continued to denigrate \nthe place. \n \n Stigma is, then, a special case of the ascription of place-identity.  It is the marked \nexception to the rule that place identities are given in a routine form, without comment.  \nWhen someone is associated with a stigmatized place, it is too salient to pass unnoted by \n  Place - 27 \nhedged form, that \u2018I find it all right\u2019.   The \u2018whew\u2019 suggests there is something more to \nsay about Callen, so there would be conversational opportunities if Carl had taken up \ntheir invitation to assert he lived in the roughest estate in town, but he turns down this \noffer and offers a general defence \u2013 \u2018that goes for every\u2019 (21).  Then there is a kind of \nremedial work; Ken and Jack overlap to echo and complete forms of this commonplace \n(\u2018every estate\u2019 (22), and more generally \u2018everywhere\u2019 (23)), suggesting they are not \nstigmatizing Carl.  The moderator\u2019s very hesitant closing of the topic before moving onto \nthe next introduction marks this again as a potentially sensitive topic. \n \n An ascription may be presented as a joke, though it is not always taken that way \nby those stigmatized.  In the following example, the place comes up later in the group, \nand Simon (who now lives on the other side of the country) claims it at this point as his \nhome town.  First James doesn\u2019t seem to hear Simon\u2019s very quiet interjection. \n4.1679 \n1. James I mean, if anybody's ever up in: . Cleveland . up in Middlesborough \/ \n2. Simon  \/ \u00bamy home town\u00ba \n3. James Jesus Christ I mean you see it from miles away at night when you're \ndriving there . the whole place is lit up . what the quality of the air must \nhave been up there over the last forty or fifty years  \n4. Simon \u00bamy home town\u00ba \n5. James   \/must have been horrendous \n6. Mod \/h h \n  Place - 26 \n13. K: (     ) \n14. J: (gun shop) \n15. Mod: h h h  what it it\u2019s a rough estate is it \n16. K: definitely \n17. C: I find it all right \n18. Mod: you find it all right \n19. C: it has a bad reputation   \n20. Mod: has it .  yeah? \n21. C: a few lunatics there . that goes for every= \n22. J: =every \/estate \n23. K: \/well it's just like everything else isn\u2019t it? there's good and bad everywhere \nisn\u2019t there? \n24. Mod: yeah (2) what- what estate was that again?  sorry \n25. C: Callen \/ Callen Estate \n26. Mod \/Callen . right . right . OK . yea:h (2) OK thanks \n \nThe \u2018whew\u2019 response (10)  suggests that other participants recognize \u2018Callen Estate\u2019, and \nexpect others to recognize it, as a meaningful place, and that this meaning is relevant, \nwhile not actually making a verbal comment.  Ken and Jack (who have been introduced \nand have already done a lot of talking) chime in repeatedly with humorous comments \n(some of them barely inaudible) on this estate.  When the Moderator displays his \nignorance of this place (12) and formulates their comments as an explicit evaluation (15), \nKen confirms this negative evaluation.  But Carl immediately comes in to assert, in \n  Place - 25 \ntragedy (on the use of the term 'stigma' in an environmental context, see Gregory, Flynn \nand Slovic 1995).  When participants signal that something is problematic about this \nplace, the person who is from the place can go along, reject the stigma, or disaffiliate \nfrom the place. \n \n This example is an unusual case where other participants comment during the \nround of introductions;  they bring out  the negative associations with this estate (what in \nUS English would be a public housing project), apparently for the benefit of the \nmoderator. \n42.2 \n1. Mod: thanks John . all right . you couldn\u2019t sort of say who you are? \n2. C: all right my name\u2019s Carl  \n3. Mod: Carl . yeah? \n4. C: lived in Preston all my life \n5. Mod: all right . OK \n6. C: married 20 year \n7. Mod: yeah \n8. C: same address twenty- uh twenty year now . Callan Estate \n9. Mod: right \n10. K: whew \n11. J: (hard work there)  \n12. Mod:  why what\u2019s what\u2019s \n  Place - 24 \nUnlike Pat, who wanted to dismiss the relevance of his other place,  Ellen builds a case \nthat allows her to claim this alternative identity:   she worked there, has family there, and \nwas with them through a difficult time.  She signals the possible laughability of saying \nthat the hurricane was a link (8);  another participant takes up this laughter, while the \nmoderator responds without laughing.  Ellen goes on to explain how this could be a link \n(a hurricane during her first visit (11), before the moderator breaks in to present a \nformulation of her turn as showing she can claim belonging based on her having family \nthere (12, 14, 16).  But she cuts off this formulation to say that she liked other places \noutside Britain (17), taking her back to the assertion in turn 1, and the topic of America \nvs. Britain. \n \n In neither Pat\u2019s case nor Ellen\u2019s is this newly asserted identity their \u2018true\u2019 identity.  \nBoth revisions are occasioned by something in the ongoing talk;  the identity as Brummie \nis relevant to the focus group introduction, and the identity as Jamaican \/ American is \nrelevant to an argument about where one could live.  Pat gives evidence for his Brummie \nstatus (\u2018forty odd years\u2019) and Ellen gives evidence for her bond to Jamaica (the \nhurricane), suggesting that both feel the need to give some account to support their \nrevision of identity.   \nStigma \n Perhaps no place one can be from is neutral in listeners\u2019 evaluations of one\u2019s \nidentity.  But some places are treated by other participants as bearing a stigma:  it could \nbe near a nuclear plant, or a rough neighbourhood, or a name associated with a disaster or \n  Place - 23 \n2. M1 \u00bacan\u2019t stand Americans too much \u00ba \n3. M2 yeah I (  ) \n4. Ellen: I love  .  you know my family are sort of from  .  you know Jamaica  .  \nso: and I\u2019ve spent some time out the:re and I\u2019ve got quite a you know \nrelationship there \/ really \n5. Mod: right whereabouts in Jamaica from Kingston? \n6. Ellen: um no I mean  .  St .  Anne\u2019s and Kingston  .  I worked in Kingston \nfor two years =   \n7. Mod =right \n8. Ellen so: I- you know  .  it was during the time that they had hurricanes as \nwell so:  .  it was quite a strhohnhg \/ \n9. Mod \/sure \n10. F1 \/h h h \n11. Ellen link  . with it because that was the first time \/ I\u2019d been out and they \n12. Mod: \/so you\u2019ve still got family there that you=  \n13. Ellen =yeah \n14. Mod you know talk to on a regular basis so obviously \/ \n15. Ellen \/ yeah \n16. Mod you know what\u2019s going on= \n17. Ellen: =but also I mean it\u2019s a mixture New York Jamaica and LA  .  I really \nlike I really like  .  being out there so \n \n  Place - 22 \n9. Pat: so it's about fifteen miles away \n10. Mod: okay . thanks \n \nPat corrects himself three times, in parallel instances, first to give his name as Pat, then \nPatrick, then Pat (explaining why he finally chooses this formulation), then to change his \ndescription for \u2018Ire-\u2019 to the more specific \u2018County Galway in Ireland\u2019, and finally to say \nhe is Irish but is really now \u2018a Brummie\u2019, the local\u2019s name for natives of Birmingham).  \nHe has a slight breathiness to \u2018years\u2019 (5), suggesting he presents it as potentially \nlaughable, someone who has lived \u2018here\u2019 so long still being Irish, and the moderator takes \nup the laughter.  He has placed himself in relation to the moderator\u2019s knowledge (of \nIreland), purpose (in covening a group from Birmingham) and location (here). \n \n Sometimes this assertion of an alternative geographical identity comes later in the \ngroup.  When Ellen introduced herself the exchange was: \n19.101 \n1. Mod: live in town? \n2. Ellen: uh- live in Burnage \n \nBut later she adds an alternative place. \n19.990 \n1. Ellen y\u2019know people say couldn\u2019t live or work in London but I could  .  in \nNew York . I could- \n  Place - 21 \nHenry gives his full name (though he is asked only for Christian name) and says, not that \nhe is a farmer who lives at this place, but \u2018I farm at Parkfoot Farm\u2019.  He gives the name of \nhis farm, even though it is apparent that he does not expect the moderator to recognize it, \nsince he also says without prompting where it is.  \u2018A stone\u2019s throw from here\u2019 suggests \nnot only that it is close, but that the direction, address, and directions for getting there are \nprobably irrelevant.  There are similar kinds of phrases in other groups (\u2018local . a spit \nfrom here\u2019 (7.800)).  The Moderator\u2019s response (5) takes it as news (\u2018oh?\u2019 (5)), and builds \non it with a question relevant to it, confirming that this is the sort of answer wanted. \n \n The self-identifications are not always so univocal;   Pat in this session in \nBirmingham first categorises himself as Irish, but then recategorises himself to fit the \ncategory he assumes applies to this focus group. \n27.40 \n1. Pat: um . Pat . Patrick . Pat . >everyone calls me Pat< \n2. Mod: OK? \n3. Pat: yeah I was actually born in in Ire- County Ire- in County Galway in \nIreland  \n4. Mod: right \n5. Pat: but I've lived here for forty odd yhhhears so I'm really a Brummie and \n6. Mod: right h h  \n7. Pat: I live in a place called Whittingham just outside uh Lichfield (  ) \n8. Mod: OK \n  Place - 20 \nthe moderator as the sort of person who just drives through Cheshire on the M6 (the main \nNorth-South motorway) unaware of its towns.  Schegloff notes that \u2018It is by reference to \nthe adequate recognizability of detail, including place names, that one is in this sense a \nmember, and those who do not share such recognition are 'strangers'\u2018 (1972:  93).  Usually \nthese moderators are happy to present themselves as strangers, since this technique seems \nto get participants to talk more explicitly. \nPlacing and re-placing oneself \n As the response may ascribe an identity to the moderator (as a stranger), it may \nsignal of the participant\u2019s identity for present purposes.    Here the moderator has said the \ngroup is \u2018just about people\u2019s attitudes to animals, and the first participant presents himself \nin a way that projects his authenticity on this topic. \n40.28  \n1. Mod: so perhaps if we could start off if you could just sort of tell us your \nname- your Christian name and perhaps . say where you live . if you \nwork what you do . and how long you've lived here . and then we'll \nstart off . so  would that be OK= \n2. H: =yes . Henry Brown \n3. Mod: Henry \n4. Henry: I farm at Parkfoot Farm which is about a stone\u2019s throw from here \n5. Mod: oh? right (2) and how long have you been farming \n6. Henry: all my life \n \n  Place - 19 \nto talk quite a lot about place in the  .  discussion . what \nQ3\u0001 6. D: >where do I live< \nA3\u0001 7. Mod: yeah \n 8. D : my name's Dave  \n 9. Mod: Dave yeah \nA1--> 10. D: and I uh I live in Holmes Chapel in uh Cheshire . just off . \nthe M6  \n \nQ2 displays the ambiguity of the question \u2018Where are you from\u2019, and the moderator \nresponds, not by disambiguating the question, but by justifying its relevance (5) \u2013 they \nwill talk about place. (In a previous example (24.17), we saw that the relevance was \n\u2018everybody will get to know each other\u2019).  The participant tries again, and in Q3 \nreformulates the question in terms he can answer unambiguously (6).  He then goes back \nto give his name (8) before giving the answer (10).   \n \nThe continuation of turn 10 of the last example shows how a naming of place tells \nabout the questioner, as well as about the answerer: \n10. D: and I uh I live in Holmes Chapel in uh Cheshire . just off . the M6 (2) \nif you're not at all familiar with it it's just off junction eighteen \n11. Mod: h h so that's how you indicate it by junction h h h   \n \nAs with the previous example, the elaboration of the answer comes after a rather long \npause (2 seconds) does not get a response from the moderator.  Dave\u2019s answer projects \n  Place - 18 \nof the relation between the moderator and the participant, or alternative identities for \nparticipants, or signals of what might follow conversationally from questions about place. \nIDENTITIES \nPlacing the Moderator \nWhen this routine of question and answer breaks down in the introductory \nsequence, the problem is not usually that the question is hard to answer, but that it is \ndifficult to choose the right formulation for this situation.  Insertion sequences, the \nconversational devices that Schegloff was investigating in his paper on place (1972), are \none way these problems are indicated;  they occur when a question is followed, not by an \nanswer, but by another question that is nonetheless heard as relevant, not as a failure to \ngive an answer.  So, for instance, a participant might echo back the question to signal part \nof it as problematic. \n18.31 \n \n \nQ1\u0001 \n1. Mod: but um perhaps we could just begin by each of you telling \nus (.) telling us your first name a:nd (.) where you come \nfrom (4)[ ] \nQ2\u0001 2. D: do you mean which company or which \/  \n 3. Mod: \/no \n 4. D: country or h h h  \n 5. Mod: which country? . what- what \nA2\u0001  what place do you come from . you'll see that we're going \n  Place - 17 \n3. Mod: =that's OK h h h h h \n4. ? favourite colours \n5. Mike: yeah h h h \n6. Mod: actually if you do say where you work as well . yeah \n \nThe moderator\u2019s hedge \u2018maybe\u2019 and his \u2018basically\u2019 signal a small request, the way just \nwould do.  He pauses before the request, and then groups name and \u2018where you come \nfrom\u2019 together as a unit.  Mike continues beyond name and place (2) when there is no \nresponse from the moderator, and he pauses for three seconds before going onto the \nadditional identifying material.  The latched response of the moderator in 3 cuts Mike off, \nthe moderator\u2019s laughter suggesting there is something evidently comic about this \nadditional information, and another participant takes up the idea of laughability by adding \na field of information that seems trivial and irrelevant in this context: \u2018favourite colours\u2019 \n(and perhaps pets, leisure activities, favourite song . . .).  Mike accepts this and takes up \nthe laughter.  The moderator (now not laughing) reformulates his question to suggest that \nthough age (and favourite colours) are not relevant, place of work, even though he did not \nrequest it, is relevant.   \n \n The rapid rhythm of the questions and answers, the reduced form of the \nmoderator\u2019s responses, the participants\u2019 references to game shows and other genres in \nwhich introductions are conventional, all suggest that answering questions about place is \nroutine in introductions.  The identity work done in this routine way may only be apparent \nwhen the routine breaks down or the initial statement is revised.  Then we may see signals \n  Place - 16 \n In whatever form it is asked, the answer to \u2018where are you from\u2019 is part of a set of \nroutine identifying characteristics.  Participants may give a place even when they have \nonly been asked for names.   \n13.24 \n1. Mod: so you know perhaps . perhaps we could just go round . so Phil . Sue \nand your name is \n2. N: I'm Nick from Kirkham \n3. Mod: Nick from Kirkham   \n4. N: right \n \n \nThe moderator has asked for names, not places, but his echo of Nick\u2019s turn (3) and his \nquestion (5) signal that this pairing of name (given name) and place (name of town) is an \nacceptable form of response.  From here he just needs to say \u2018OK\u2019 to prompt the next \nspeaker to give a similar response, a name and a place. \n \n The conventional nature of these sets of introductory information is suggested by \nthe joking intervention of a participant in another group. \n24.17 \n1. Mod: OK right . if we could start by maybe going round the group and \nsaying . um what your name is and where you come from basically . \nand then everybody will get to know each other . do you mind \nstarting \n2. Mike: Mike Hannah . and I'm from Preston . I work for um BT (3) 41= \n  Place - 15 \n10. Bob: I am a retailer hardware retailer \n11. Mod: OK? \n \nDave\u2019s response provides the pattern for other participants, and it is worked out gradually \nwith the moderator.  He gives his first name (2), pauses, and when there is no response \nfrom the moderator gives his surname as well.  Then he goes on to say where he comes \nfrom.  This is all that was asked for, but when he just gets a continuer in response (3), he \ngoes on, after a pause, to give his job.  Then he gets an \u2018OK\u2019, and a pause while the \nmoderator writes this down, and then the moderator turns to the next participant.  The \nmoderator\u2019s \u2018and\u2019 (5) suggests that the participants know enough now to produce a next \nanswer without further prompting.   In general participants follow the pattern set by the \nfirst person to respond, when the moderator accepts it, and the moderator\u2019s responses can \nbe more and more reduced when the pattern is established.  In this case, the first \nparticipant takes the question to be asking for the name of a village or neighbourhood, not \nfor instance a city (Preston), region (Lancashire), or employer.  Only one first speaker, in \nthe 40 groups, is more specific than Dave and gives an address.  Very few speakers take \nthe opportunity to say anything more than a name and a place.  The brevity of responses \nand the lack of response from participants other than the moderator suggest that they do \nnot take this information as a possible starting point for conversation before everyone in \nthe circle has been identified.   \n \n  Place - 14 \n\u2022 \u2018what I'd like to do is just go round and find out who you are and it'd also be quite \nhelpful if you just give me an idea of how long you've lived in the area . just to \nhave some sense of how local you are\u2019 (34) (like the previous example, but gives a \nreason for wanting to know) \nIt might seem that these are hardly the same question.  But they have one significant word \nin common:  just.  This minimizing adverb with the directive presents it as a small \nrequest, and the responses generally treat it that way.  These questions are part of a \nstandard three-part sequence with the moderator\u2019s imperative or question, the \nparticipant\u2019s response, and the moderator\u2019s confirmation that this response is appropriate \nbefore going on to the next participant. \n23.44 \n1. Mod: Um (3.0) what I want to start with is just some introductions um (2.0) \nwhere you live and your names so probably the simplest thing is just \nto go round starting at the left here \n2. Dave: Yeah my name is Dave (.) Nolan and (.) I come from Leyland  \n3. Mod: uh huh \n4. Dave: and (.) I have a travel business, \n5. Mod: OK (3.0) and \n6. Bob: Bob (.) Bob Jackson  \n7. Mod: uh huh \n8. Bob: I live in Ashton at Preston \n9. Mod: \u00b0OK\u00b0 \n  Place - 13 \nROUTINENESS \nDespite all the complexities of response to questions about place that I have outlined, \nparticipants seem to know what to do at the beginning of a focus group.  This routineness \nis important in itself;  the participants and even the researcher may barely notice the \nquestion.  Participants may know what to say based on conventions about being asked \nwhere one is from, or they may just follow the patterns set by the first person to respond, \nif the moderator seems to signal that it is an appropriate response.   Most groups begin \nafter the moderator\u2019s introduction, with the narrator calling on each participant \nsuccessively, and asking them to introduce themselves.2   \n \n The exact form of the question may vary: \n\u2022 \u2018but perhaps we could just begin by each of you telling us your first name and \nwhere you come from\u2019 (group 18) (the most usual form for these focus groups) \n\u2022 \u2018perhaps we could just go round . start by going round . saying what your first \nname perhaps and where it is you\u2019re living at the moment\u2019 (20) (reduces the \nambiguity by asking only where they live) \n\u2022 \u2018and just tell me . so . oh you\u2019re not all from Thornton are you?\u2019 (16) (presupposes \nthat one place is the reference point, and marks his realization as news) \n\u2022 \u2018if we could start off if you could just tell us your Christian name and perhaps say \nwhere you live . if you work . what do you do . and how long you've lived here\u2019 \n(40) (like the previous example, presupposes a shared place, but names it only as \n\u2018here\u2019) \n  Place - 12 \nfrom six different projects on different topics (see note 1 for details);  some of these \ntranscripts deal explicitly and at length with participants\u2019 feelings about the places where \nthey live, but in others place is not highlighted in any way.   \n \n Critical qualitative researchers have often noted the importance of the location of \ninterviews (Becker 1998; Elwood and Martin 2000; Sin 2003). Examples of critical \napproaches to place using focus group methods include the work of Jacqueline Burgess \nand her colleagues (Burgess, Limb and Harrison 1988; Burgess, Limb and Harrison \n1988), who used in-depth focus groups to explore people\u2019s feelings about local parks and \nopen space, and the work of Peter Jackson and Beverley Holbrook (1995), who related \nshopping to neighbourhoods, identities, daily practices.   \n \n Several aspects of focus group design constrain the kinds of questions and \nanswers found in these transcripts.  Focus groups are typically held in what the \nresearchers take to be \u2018neutral\u2019 places, a room at a pub or hotel, a living room, a \ncommunity hall (see Elwood and Martin (2000) on the difficulty of finding neutral \nplaces). There is a moderator, who in all cases here presents herself or himself as a \nstranger to the place the session is being held.  There are other participants, who are \nalways (in these groups) from a more or less local area, but who are, except in four \ngroups, strangers to one another.  Finally, there is the tape recorder, the evidence that \nunseen others will be listening to this talk for their own purposes.   \n  Place - 11 \nBarbara Johnstone reviews a number of recent studies in which local dialect is used to \nconstruct a stance in interaction (2004; forthcoming).  Ron Scollon and Suzanne Wong \nScollon have reformulated interactional and semiotic approaches to discourse, taking \nsituation in place as the starting point (2003).  In sociolinguistics and discourse studies, as \nin geography, researchers are moving from the assumption that place defines identity, to \nstudies of the ways participants may make place relevant to their identities in situated \ninteractions. \n \n One comment should be made on the implicit evaluative thrust of most of these \nstudies.  For Schegloff, Geographical and Relational formulations are just two possible \nsecond parts.  But for almost all the other writers I have quoted, there is something richer \nabout the alternatives to a grid-like sense of space, something more embedded in \npractices, time, everydayness, even wisdom.  And almost all these writers assume that \ntheir discipline \u2013 whether it is anthropology, sociology, physics, or geography \u2013 has \ntended to overlook this Relational, situated sense of place, while privileging the \nsystematizing overview of Geographical formulations. \nDATA \nIn this study I will look at passages from 40 transcripts of focus groups held in England \nbetween 1994 and 2003 (for references on focus groups, see Macnaghten and Myers \n2003; Myers 2004). Groups had 6-8 participants, and were led by one or two moderators \nwho were usually not identified as being from a particular place or institution until the \nend of the session (I was moderator on two of these groups).  The focus groups are drawn \n  Place - 10 \nevery time I enter the UK.  Even in everyday, non-institutional conversations, \u2018where are \nyou from?\u2019 is a question that has to have an answer, however complicated.  (If one \nGoogles the phrase \u2018be from somewhere\u2019, one will find it collocates often with the phrase \n\u2018have to . . .\u2019).  As we will see, the participants in my data are always ready to give some \nformulation of where they are from, even if they may be unsure which formulation they \nchoose.   \n \n If place-identity is useful because everyone has to be from somewhere on the map, \nit is productive in conversation because it can lead on to more talk, further meanings, \npractices.  If strangers find themselves talking to each other on a plane, or at a party, they \nare likely to find themselves describing their place in one way or another, possibly even \nbefore exchanging names.  References to place can provide a basis for what someone says \nnext, for instance for a moral lesson (Basso 1996), a story (Becket 1996), or an argument \n(Dixon and Durrheim 2000), or just talk about commuting.   \n \n How does sociolinguistics fit in among all these philosophers, geographers, and \nanthropologists?  One can place oneself even before one answers the question \u2018where are \nyou from\u2019, as I did to the plumber with my American accent, and as some participants do \nin the examples that follow.  More recent sociolinguistic studies have developed a more \ncomplex sense of what it means to be from a place, as they studied migration, change, and \ncontact.  Lesley Milroy (1980), for instance, reconceived the relations between her \ninformants in terms of overlapping networks.  Penelope Eckert (2000: 33) defines her \nsubjects in terms of practices, and she raises the issue of boundaries as problematic.  \n  Place - 9 \nGeographers have a long-standing concern with place-linked identities, most recently in \nresponse to debates about globalization (for introductions, see Massey and Jess 1996; \nThrift 1997).  So, for instance, Allan Pred (1990:  182-227) has shown how workers \ndeveloped an alternative set of names for places and streets in Stockholm as the city went \nthrough its most rapid growth in the late 19th century.  Karen I. Blu (1996) finds different \nplace names, and different senses of place, among Native American, African American, \nand White residents of Robeson County,  North Carolina.  Jon Anderson focuses on the \nrelations between talking, walking, and memory in \u2018constitutive co-ingredience\u2019 of place \nand identity  (Anderson 2004). \n \n There are, of course, many definitions of identity.  If we take it to be, in Penelope \nEckert\u2019s definition, \u2018one\u2019s \u201cmeaning in the world\u201d\u2019 (Eckert 2000: 41), then practices \naround place are crucial;  by saying where I am from, I take on a location in the world, \nand the place has a meaning or meanings for the world.  A different but not inconsistent \ndefinition is used by social psychologists drawing on Harvey Sacks:  \u2018a person's identity \nis their display of, or ascription to, membership of some social category, with \nconsequences for the interaction in which the display or ascription takes place\u2019 (Antaki \nand Widdicombe 1998).  This definition gives a sense of the ways people try on identities \n(gender, age, profession, ethnicity), or other people ascribe identities to them, as part of \nongoing talk in interaction.   \n \n This tentative, contingent, ongoing ascription of identity might not seem to apply \nto place:  everyone has to have a place.  I must write down where I was born on a form \n  Place - 8 \neven though being from the smaller place necessarily means one is from the larger place \ntoo.   \nMeanings \nSchegloff\u2019s distinction between Geographical and Relational formulations is \ncomplementary to other distinctions used by geographers and anthropologists.  There is, \nfirst of all, the standard distinction in cultural geography between space, considered as a \npreexisting grid of physical locations, and place, a specific location given meaning by \npeople\u2019s practices, language, and beliefs.  The philosopher Edward Casey (1993; 1996) \nhas argued that we tend to think of space as a preexisting reality to which we then give \ncultural meanings, while it would be truer to see space as a generalized sense of particular \nplaces.  Tim Ingold (2000) draws a distinction (based  in Heidegger) between a \nperspective based on building, a construction on pre-existing, uniform space, and \ndwelling, in which life and its practices precede the organization of space (cf. Szerszynski \n2004).  He makes a similar distinction between map-making as the inscription of fixed \nimage of landscape, and mapping as the reenactment of movements through a landscape, \nin time, as part of one\u2019s tasks.  What links these various perspectives is the sense that \nplace is not just a set of coordinates on a grid; it is meaningful in terms of participants\u2019 \npractices and beliefs. \nIdentities \nIf we are to look to participants\u2019 practices for meanings of places, the answer to the \nquestion \u2018where are you from\u2019 does not just give a location;  it defines what Proshansky \nand his colleagues have called \u2018place-identity\u2019 (Proshansky, Fabian and Kaminoff 1983). \n  Place - 7 \nthere\u2019, \u2018Derwent Road\u2019, \u2018Lancaster\u2019, \u2018Lancashire,\u2019 \u2018the North\u2019, or \u2018the UK\u2019.  Gale and \nGolledge (1982) say that differences in scale call for different bases for human geography \n-- \u2018perception for the immediate sensory experiences, cognition for the vaster areas \nbeyond immediate experience\u2019 and different epistemologies --  \u2018empiricism at the \nimmediate sensory level, constructivism at the cognitive level\u2019 (1982:  64).  Instead of \nmaking the distinction on epistemological grounds, Schegloff, typically, starts with the \nsituated interaction, the location and relation of the participants and the turn by turn \nexchanges.  For instance, after an event that might endanger someone (his example is the \n1965 Watts riots), distant relatives and friends call people anywhere near the event to see \nif they are okay, not realizing that the local sense of scale might be different (someone at \nUCLA in Westwood might not think of themselves as being anywhere near South Central \nLos Angeles). \n \n Distinctions of scale might seem logical in terms of a Geographical view of \nplaces, a matter of degree of precision on the map.  Any particular place is necessarily \nincluded in other, larger places, as Blackburn is in Lancashire, Lancashire is in England, \nEngland is part of the United Kingdom, and the UK is (arguably) in Europe.  But in \nRelational terms, place names are not neatly nested systems of attributes, the more \ngeneral including the more particular. We will see later that to say one is from the Callen \nEstate in Blackburn does not convey the same thing as saying one is from Blackburn or \nLancashire, with more particularity;  it conveys, to those who know it, its own \nassociations;  similarly saying one lives near Sellafield is not the same as saying one is \nfrom Cumbria, saying one is from Austin is not the same as saying one is from Texas, \n  Place - 6 \nflexibility of place references may come as a surprise, because we think we have \nunambiguous ways of locating places, for instance with grid references or directions.  \nSchegloff analyses place formulations as either Geographical (\u20183 miles north of Preston\u2019) \nor Relational (\u2018just ten minutes up the A6\u2019).  Geographical formulations assume an \nobjective overview from a point outside the map;  Relational formulations are situated in \nthe current interaction.  \n \n When Schegloff discusses formulations of place in relation to members, he means \nthat we adjust what we say to take into account who the other person is (a stranger, an \nofficial, a local), and where they are (here, at the other end of the phone, on another \ncontinent).  He also means that participants consider the function of this reference to \nplace in the mutual activity in which they are participating.  Schegloff was analyzing calls \nto an emergency help line, where the answerer has to determine which area the call is \nfrom, and which address within that area.  Someone giving directions uses a different set \nof turns (Psathas 1991; Basso 1996). And calls to a local radio phone-in would call for \nother kinds of naming, enough to give a sense of the identity of the caller, and the range \nof the broadcast audience, but not enough to locate their address (Myers 2004).   \n \n One kind of flexibility noted by Schegloff is in the scale of the formulation.  Any \nplace can be described in broader or narrower terms, as a child writes his or her address in \na book, from street address up through town and nation to the universe.  Participants are \nnot consistent in which level of scale they consider appropriate for their answer, just as \nmy response to the question \u2018where are you from?\u2019 might in different situations be \u2018over \n  Place - 5 \nTALK, PLACE, AND IDENTITIES \n Several lines of academic work have charted the complexity of talk about place, \nfrom sociology, anthropology, cultural geography and social psychology, as one might \nexpect, and also from sociolinguistics and discourse analysis.  I start with a classic study \nof formulating place in situated interactions, then draw on a range of studies of the \nmeanings of places in discourse, and then consider ways that place can signal identities.  \nIndexicality \nEmanuel Schegloff\u2019s \u2018Notes on a conversational practice:  formulating place\u2019 \n(1972), argues that the naming of place is flexible in the form of reference and the scale \nof referent, and is situated in ongoing interaction.   For Schegloff, the formulation of \nplace is a side issue that arises from his interest in \u2018insertion sequences\u2019 (examples of \nwhich I will discuss later). Schegloff analyses the routines for giving, checking, and \nconfirming that the description of place one has given is that needed for the current \ninteraction: \nThe 'problem' of locational formulation is this:  For any location to which \nreference is made, there is a set of terms each of which, by a correspondence test, \nis a correct way to refer to it.  On any actual occasion of use, however, not any \nmember of the set is 'right' (1972:  81). \nOf course the same indexicality might apply to any reference in talk:  there are various \npossible formulations for referring to a person, or a thing, or a time (Harvey Sacks deals \nwith the vagueness and range of time references in his Lectures on Conversation  (1992: \nI,739-41)).  But we expect these references to be potentially problematic, while the \n  Place - 4 \nasks me, \u2018So where are you from?\u2019  The right answer cannot be my address, \nneighbourhood, or town, because he knows those, or my place of employment, since that \ncould hardly matter to him.  I assume he has noticed that my accent is not local, and I \nmust be \u2018from\u2019 somewhere else.  But the right answer at this moment is not \u2018the United \nStates\u2019, because he can probably tell that too, or he wouldn\u2019t have asked.  So I say I grew \nup in the Northwest, or if pressed, I say I\u2019m from Boise, Idaho.  That usually stops the \nconversation dead.  So answers to this question are routine (I am not the only person who \nis asked this sort of question all the time), flexible (I had several responses to choose \nfrom), relational (I tried to guess why he was asking), and they affect what comes next \n(they could provide a basis for his stories or comments, if I\u2019d been from a place more \nlikely to be visited by or known to a Briton). \n \n In this paper, I will look at answers to questions such as \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 at \nthe beginnings of focus groups, and at later passages where participants again have reason \nto refer to where they are from.  I will look at smooth sequences that suggest the \nroutineness of the question, and at more complex exchanges with insertion sequences and \nself corrections that show the flexibility of possible responses.  But this flexibility is not \ncompletely open-ended;  participants choose their responses in terms of whom they are \ntalking to and how they are presenting themselves.  References to place project further \npossibilities for talk, evaluating and defending, telling stories, and arguing.  So references \nto place are important, not just for finding out about places, but also for finding identities \nin talk. \n \n  Place - 3 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nStephanie Taylor and Margeret Wetherell say in their analysis of interviews in the UK \nwith New Zealanders: \u2018It is perhaps a temptation in the analysis of talk to treat the sites \nand contexts, whether assumed or referred to, as fixed entities, like stage sets and \nbackdrops to the play of discursive interaction\u2019 (Taylor and Wetherell 1999). As \nresearchers, we do treat sites as fixed entities whenever we write the place on the cassette \nbox, or at the top of the transcript, or in a blank on the questionnaire. Even when \nparticipants are asked to talk explicitly about place and identity, researchers often treat it \nas something already out there to which everyone can refer, something that remains stable \nin different contexts.  And researchers usually give only the statements of participants, not \nthe interactions leading to such statements (as noted in Laurier 1999). The processes of \nasking about places, choosing from various ways of referring to them, making them \nrelevant to other participants, and relating them to the ongoing talk are often taken for \ngranted.  Afterwards, these passages may be treated as part of the warm-up before the real \ndata begins, or deliberately excised to preserve anonymity.  In this paper I am suggesting \nthat researchers should look at how people talk about place before they try to categorise \nwhat participants say about it.  This shift in perspective has implications both for social \nresearch on place, and for the study of talk in place. \n \n For such a common question, the answers to \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 can be \nsurprisingly complex.  Consider how I respond when a plumber who is repairing my sink \n  Place - 2 \n\u2018Where are you from?\u2019  Identifying Place  \nABSTRACT \nMany social research projects, such as interviews, focus groups, and surveys, take local \nplace as a given:  they choose participants from a particular place, take this place as \nbackground for what the participants say, ask them about place-related issues, and \ncorrelate responses with different places.  But people can identify places in different \nways, in geographical or relational terms, and in different levels of scale.  This study \nanalyses passages in focus groups in which participants say where they are from, shows \nthat participants generally take the question and answer as routine, and then shows the \nways the interaction develops when this routineness is broken, amended, or called into \nquestion.  When participants revise their statement of where they are from, they adapt to \nwhat they see as the knowledge and stance of their interlocutor, they re-present \nthemselves, and they create possibilities for further talk, defending, telling stories, or \nshowing entitlement to an opinion.  I argue that the ways people answer this question, \ninteractively, can tell us about them, and us, as well as about their map of the world. \n \nkeywords:  place-identity, conversation analysis, focus groups, stance, stories, arguments, \nqualitative research methods \n \nrunning title:  Where Are You From? \n9,548 words in body of text \n  Place - 1 \n\u2018Where are you from?\u2019  Identifying Place1  \nGreg Myers \nDepartment of Linguistics and English Language \nLancaster University \nLancaster LA1 4YT, United Kingdom \nNational Grid:  SD486575 \n \n \n"}
