Scope: monograph. Level: professional and general reader.\nGiancarlo Genta asks the age-old question \u201cAre we alone in the Universe\u201d, i.e. are humans\nthe only intelligent, conscious, self-aware forms of life anywhere? In attempting to answer\nit, he paints the fullest possible picture of the evidential background, considers every idea\nand its ramifications in painstaking detail, and carefully outlines the counter-argument to\nevery argument. It is an absolutely fascinating subject, but one where most writers seem\nto be pursuing an agenda of their own, using their article or book to advance a particular\ntheory \u2013 so that the reader has to be constantly on their guard. Not so with the present\nbook. It is scrupulously fair, even to ideas that (to this reviewer) seem self-evidently dotty\nsuch as UFOs and abductions by aliens. In each case, the evidence is carefully weighed\nand analysed. Often, it quickly becomes clear that an explicit opinion from the author\nwould be otiose. In a minority of cases, he sums up a discussion of some particularly\nvexatious question by expressing his own cautious judgement.\nThe main material is divided into five chapters, an Interlude and an Epilogue. They\nrange widely in content, covering evolution, prehistory, history, philosophy, religion, cos-\nmology, astrobiology, the on-going active search for extraterrestrial intelligence (and stu-\npidity), the possibility of contact and its potential consequences. The author is Professor\nof Mechanics in the Politecnico di Torino and also Director of the Italian SETI (Search\nfor Extraterrestrial Inteligence) Study Centre.\nGenta points out that the ancients in all cultures had no doubts about the correct\nanswer to the above question. Their world pictures were crowded with intelligent beings,\nusually with magical powers, and often living aloft in heavens that did not relate directly\nto the physical universe. It was completely obvious to them that humankind is not alone.\nSince then, with the advent of science, the outlook has changed to the point where it is a\nmatter of strong contention whether we are alone or not. The first chapter sets the context\nwith succinct accounts of the relevant features of ancient and medi\u00e6val philosophy, the\nRenaissance, and the birth of modern science. It also describes some of the first proposals\nfor communication, in the era of the telescope but prior to the discovery of radio. In\n1820, Gauss suggested communicating with the supposed inhabitants of the Moon by\nplanting trees in Siberia in the form of a right-angled triangle with squares on all three\nsides. He also proposed using 100\u00d71m2 mirrors. As an alternatve approach, von Littrov\n1\nPublished in Contemp. Phys. 50, 487-489 (2009).\nsuggested digging a huge trench in the Sahara in some geometrical shape, filling it with\noil, and lighting it. These and other similar proposals assumed that mathematics is\na universal language, and that our evident understanding of geometry would convince\nextraterrestrials that the Earth was inhabited by intelligent beings. Genta also describes\nthe famous canali that Schiaparelli and other astronomers thought they observed on Mars,\nand their seasonal changes, as well as Lowell\u2019s exaggerated social interpretations of the\nobservations. Of course, it is now known that these were just artifacts created by the eye\u2019s\ntendancy to try to make sense of random arrays of dots when operating at its limits of\nsensitivity: with better telescopes, later, the channels simply disappeared. And in recent\ndecades space probes have shown Mars to be a desolate place where intelligent life could\nnot be expected (though the possibility of bacteria still remains open).\nGenta provides a relatively short second chapter on the religious perspective, address-\ning the question of whether the existence of extraterrestrial life should be regarded as a\nthreat to religion. In doing so, he considers Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism and Islam as\nwell as Christianity where he addresses potential problems created by the doctrines of\noriginal sin and redemption. He quotes Teilhard de Chardin on the possibility of other\nbiospheres, in addition to that of Earth. He also looks at the growth of creationism and\nits relationships to fundamentalist religious beliefs, on the one hand, and to reality on\nthe other. His implicit conclusion is that there need be no conflict between religion and\nthe existence of extraterrestrials except in the case of fundamentalists who do not accept\nscientific method (nor, perhaps, reality) in any case.\nThe real meat of the book comes in chapters 3 and 4. The former deals with astrobi-\nology but, in order to do so effectively, it first gives an account of our current scientific\nunderstanding of the origins of the Universe, Galaxy, Solar System, planets, Earth, Moon,\nand life on Earth. Many details of this picture are obviously important to an estimate\nof the probablity of life appearing elsewhere. Of course, the definition of life itself is\na conundrum that cannot be avoided. After some discussion of the difficulties, Genta\nsuggests: \u201cLife is a self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evo-\nlution\u201d, but hastily emphasises that this and all other definitions must be labelled as\napplying to life \u201cas we know it\u201d, or \u201cof the terrestrial type\u201d. He repeatedly and wisely\ncautions that it may be extremely difficult to recognise other kinds of system as being\neither living or intelligent. He provides an extensive discussion of how life may have orig-\ninated on earth, ruminates at length on the likelihood of the event, and carefully weighs\nthe evidence for\/against panspermia (life coming to earth from elsewhere, e.g. on a mete-\n2\norite) as first proposed by Kelvin in 1871. The fact that life seems to have appeared very\nsoon after the early Earth was capable of supporting it (perhaps 3.5 billion years ago,\nthough the evidence is indirect) suggests either that the spontaneous appearance of life\nin a chemical broth has a high probability, or that life came to earth from elsewhere. The\nauthor accepts both ideas as sound hypotheses, but feels there is insufficient convincing\nevidence to come down on either side. Once there is life (at least approximately as we\nknow it), we can expect mutations to produce variety and Darwinian evolution to select\nfitter individuals and to move (perhaps) in the direction of greater complexity. So it is in\na way surprising that there was apparently little change for a billion years or more after\nlife appeared on Earth, but just bacteria. The first appearance of the eukaryotic cells\n(with a nucleus), of which all plants, fungi and animals are made seems to have occurred\nabout two billion years ago \u2013 and it remains unclear how probable\/improbable an event\nit was. Given the much greater variety of structures possible with eukaryotic cells as\ncompared to bacteria (prokaryotic cells), this event may have been an essential precursor\nfor the evolution of higher animals and thus for intelligent life on Earth. Among a huge\nnumber of other relevant topics, Genta also discusses catastrophes and mass extinctions,\nthe Anthropic Principle, extrasolar planets, conditions needed for the development of life,\nand the possibility of life on Mars and elsewhere in the solar system, as well as outside\nthe solar system.\nIf the definition of life is difficult, so also is the definition of intelligence. Chapter 4\nis devoted to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. So problems of intelligence, con-\nsciousness, self-awareness, and language, are unavoidable. Genta tackles them head-on,\nand provides a very interesting discussion. He argues persuasively, though with his cus-\ntomary caution, that the onset of consciousness was probably not an on\/off process but\nmore likely evolved gradually. He provides a nice perspective on how the early humans\ndeveloped, the extinctions they caused, the place of the Neanderthals (not Homo sapiens\nsapiens, but human nonetheless) and others, and the importance of culture and technol-\nogy. He goes on to discuss the expansion of intelligent life, and the expected propagation\nof humans and their culture throughout the Universe. He points out that the set-backs\nto manned space exploration of the last few decades are just transient and that, on an\nevolutionary timescale, the process has hardly started yet. He discusses various practi-\ncal ways of dealing with the enormous timescales of interstellar travel, considering speed\n(near c to cause time dilatation), hibernation, \u201cspace arks\u201d with perhaps a million peo-\nple, and additional possibilities. Assuming that there might be extraterrestrial creatures\n3\nheading our way, how can we hope to communicate with them? Genta first discusses the\nlikelihood of this, introducing Drake\u2019s equation and pointing out its uncertainties, and\nthen considers the possible means of communication.\nAfter a short Interlude (on the Search for Extraterrestrial Stupidity which, actually, is\nmuch more than just a joke), Genta discussus the possibility of contact in Chapter 5. He\nopens with a discussion of what is known as the Fermi paradox (though the ideas were\nfirst enunciated by Tsiolkovsky), which asks (in effect): space travel is obviously possible;\none expects there to be older and therefore technologically more advanced species in the\nUniverse; so why are they not already here, visiting us? This is where the UFO-ology\ncomes in, because some suggest that the visitors are aready here, but the evidence is\nweak to say the least. It is also possible that extraterrestrial intelligence does not exist,\nor that interstellar travel is actually impossible. And then there is the zoo hypothesis, in\nwhich our potential visitors are standing well back while they watch with interest to see\nwhat happens to us. Genta considers all of these, and many other possible answers, and\ncarefully evaluates each of them.\nAlthough, in his Epilogue, Genta concludes that it is currently impossible to give a\ndefinitive answer to our opening question, the reader will have gained a very clear and\nrounded understanding of the on-going debate and of the main points of contention.\nIt is a solemn, scholarly, and intensely serious book, carefully and very well-written in\nEnglish (though with recognisably Italian prose style). The sweep of the subject matter\nis on a truly vast scale, covering many different sciences as well as the relevant history,\nphilosophy, theology, and history of science at the beginning. Every reader, even those\nwho are not especially enthused by the prospect of extraterrestrials, is likely to appreciate\nthis splendid portrait of humankind\u2019s cosmic origins and of how we fit into the grand\nscheme of existence.\nPeter V.
