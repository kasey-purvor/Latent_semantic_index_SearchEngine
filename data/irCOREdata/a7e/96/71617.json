It is shown that studying the actors and their interactions across relational \nnetworks is vital to fully understand how global relational forms are constructed and to understand \ntheir structuring effects on the global economy.   \n \nKeywords: \nKnowledge; professional service firms; law; globalization; relational networks; London; New York; \ninterviews \n \n \n 3 \nRelational networks of knowledge production in transnational \nlaw firms \n \n \n1) Introduction \nDebate surrounding the \u2018knowledge economy\u2019 (Department for Trade and \nIndustry, 1998; Leadbeater, 1999; OECD, 2000) has highlighted the importance \nof strategies to effectively create, manipulate and exploit knowledge within firms \nin order to drive competitiveness.  For geographers, this has renewed the \nurgency of deliberations about the socio-spatial characteristics of learning and \nknowledge (Amin and Cohendet, 1999; 2004; Bunnel and Coe, 2001).  For \nexample, studies of manufacturing (Sturgeon, 2003), advertising services \n(Faulconbridge, 2006; Grabher, 2002) and retail (Currah and Wrigley, 2004) have \nidentified the importance of globally stretched practices of knowledge production \nand circulation.  This also links to wider discussions within the social sciences of \nknowledge management in organizations (e.g. Skymre, 1999).  Focus here is \nupon the way firms implement practices that, crudely defined, allow employees to \nlearn from one-another\u2019s insights and to translate and reinterpret the knowledge \nof colleagues.   \nExploration of such issues by geographers has been grounded in several \nrecent theoretical developments.  Attempts within economic geography to \u2018open \nthe black box\u2019 used to represent firms (Taylor and Asheim, 2001) have revealed \nthe socially and culturally inflected networks that influence decision making, \n 4 \nefficiency and productivity in firms (Schohenberger, 1997).  Analyses of \n\u2018relational economic geographies\u2019 (Boggs and Rantisi, 2004; Bathelt and Glucker, \n2003) and \u2018global production networks\u2019 (Dicken et al. 2001; Henderson et al. \n2002) have also provided more delicate conceptualisations of the spatial \ncharacteristics of global organizational networks.  Such approaches take into \naccount both the role of socially constructed network spaces and their cultural \nand political inflection (Dicken et al. 2001).  It has, therefore, been suggested that \nwe trace the relational actor-networks involved in the constitution of space and \ntime in order to identify the practices of network formation and their time-space \nheterogeneity (Hess, 2004).  Amin (2002, 386) has argued that there is the need \nfor \u201ca different interpretation, one which emphasises a topology marked by \noverlapping near \u2013 far relations and organisational connections that are not \nreducible to scalar spaces\u201d.   \nTo date, however, there has been a failure to use empirical material to \ndevelop such an approach.  Equally troubling is the relative neglect of service \nindustries by geographers in their analysis of relational networks (but see Coe et \nal. 2005; Currah and Wrigley, 2004) and, in particular, knowledge-intensive or \nprofessional service firms (PSFs).  As Morris and Empson (1998, 612) note, \n\u201c[t]he knowledge base represents both an input and an output of the PSF.  It is an \ninput in terms of the expertise residing in the firm and it is an output in the form of \nproducts or services generated to solve client problems\u201d.  Consequently, \nLowendahl (2000, 152-153) proposes that  \u201cglobal presence may enable the firm \nto develop broader \u2018experience records\u2019 and shared knowledge\u2026In PSFs the \n 5 \ncompetitive advantage, if achieved, results from the ability of the firm to \ncontinuously tap into the knowledge developed in all relevant centres of the \nworld\u201d.  \nThis paper, therefore, offers a timely empirical analysis of the way \ntransnational legal PSFs develop relational networks of knowledge production.  \nTransnational law firms provide an ideal case study to examine issues related to \nthe geographies of knowledge production.  Their primary aim is to deliver \nintegrated services to clients through the synergism of the knowledge of lawyers \nworking in several offices.  As one firm suggests, \u201cOur knowledge, like our \nclients' interests, transcends geographic boundaries. All of our clients have \naccess to the expertise of our lawyers, wherever they are based. As a single \npartnership, White & Case functions as an integrated team\u201d \n(http:\/\/www.whitecase.com\/About\/Overview.aspx [accessed 12\/01\/06]).  \nConsequently, successful engagement in forms of stretched knowledge \n\u2018management\u2019 is essential but also inevitably raises a number of significant \nchallenges. As Beaverstock et al. (1999) suggest, transnational law firms are \nsimultaneously embedded, to use Hess\u2019 (2004) terminology, by the national \n\u2018territorial\u2019 systems of law and the transnational network relationships between \noffices and between offices and TNC clients. This means that the simplistic \ntransfer of legal best practice between offices is impossible. However, effectively \nnurtured transnational networks might allow the dis- and re-embedding of legal \npractices. Thus studying transnational law firms and exploring the ways learning \nnetworks are achieved as social spaces might advance our understanding of the \n 6 \ncharacteristics and formation of relational networks. Even more significantly, this \nmight also reveal the way transnational networks are beginning to influence the \nlegal and professional systems and practices in which each office is embedded \nas ideas, norms and values get retranslated into the local context, thus \ninfluencing existing national practice in ways unlikely before such extra-local \ninfluences existed.  Indeed, studying this peculiar local-global tension in the \norganization of transnational law firms allows two arguments to be put forward \nthat have significance for wider debates about relationality. \nFirst, the empirical material is used to show that unpacking the social \nconstitution of relational network space is essential as we further strive to \ndevelop understanding of relational economic geographies.  This is exemplified \nby the way law firms rely upon the nurturing of spaces of social practice to enable \nstretched knowledge production, something which points to the need for micro-\nlevel analyses that bring into view the actors in relational networks.  Second, it is \nsuggested that the nature of such networks leads to complex power relations, \nsomething often obscured by macro-level analyses of the outcomes of \nrelationality.  The empirical material is, therefore, used to embellish the work of \ngeographers, and especially Allen (2003), on power as a relational construct.  \nThis again highlights the value of focussing upon the human and non-human, \nsocial and organizational actors and influences in relational networks and the \nordering outcomes of powerful relations.  The value of such an approach is \nexemplified by exploring the emergence of a \u2018transnational\u2019 legal model based on \nUS principles and the way spheres of influence that were previously national \u2013 \n 7 \nlegal practice and the norms of lawyer\u2019s behaviour \u2013 are being tainted and \nmanipulated by extra-local, transnational forces.        \nThe rest of the paper develops these arguments over five further sections.  \nSection two explores the ways that extant literatures can inform our \nunderstanding of transnational knowledge networks in legal PSFs.  Section three \noutlines the methodology used to collect the empirical interview data analysed in \nthe paper.  Sections four and five then present an analysis of the empirical \nmaterial that highlights the relational architectures of knowledge production, their \nsocial constitution and embeddedness, and the power relations in these \nnetworks.  Section six offers some conclusions that indicate the significance of \nthese findings.  The need for fine-grained analysis of the social practices and on \ngoings in relational networks is highlighted as well as the importance of focussing \nupon the conditioning effects of power relations in relational networks on the \nstructuring of economic activities. \n  \n2) Conceptualising relational knowledge networks in legal PSFs \nGeographers have long been interested in producer services (Daniels, \n1993) and most recently have endeavoured to analyse the organizational forms \nof global firms.  Extant studies (Beaverstock et al. 1999; Warf, 2001) provide \nimportant foundations for our understanding of transnational legal PSFs, in \nparticular highlighting the dominance of US and UK corporate law firms1.  \n                                            \n1\n Beaverstock et al. (1999) note that global legal PSFs operate using one of three models: (a) The \n\u2018global firm\u2019 where offices are opened overseas, managed and controlled by the partnership; (b) \n 8 \nHowever, these studies fail to provide analysis of the ways such transnational \nforms are constructed.  As Jones\u2019 (2005, 179, original emphasis) reminds us, \nthere is a pressing need to focus upon the \u201cpractices of transnational business \n(which explodes the firms as a black-box concept) rather than the quantifiable \nmeasures of the outcomes of global business activity\u201d.  Solice can be partially \nfound in the work of Beaverstock (2004) who illustrates the important role of \nexpatriation as a transnational business practice allowing knowledge circulation.  \nHowever, beyond this we are forced to turn to studies of other industries such as \nretail (Currah and Wrigley, 2004) or more generic examinations of the global \ngeographies of innovation (Bunnel and Coe, 2001) and the global architectures of \nknowledge (Amin and Cohendet, 2004) in order to glean understanding of the \nnature of stretched practices of learning.  This is not to say these studies are not \ninstructive as to how legal PSFs might engage in global knowledge management.  \nFor example they all agree upon the importance of: \n \n\u2022 Analysing the construction of \u2018spaces of interconnection\u2019 in global \norganizations (Amin and Cohendet, 2004; Bunnell and Coe, 2001).   \n                                                                                                                                  \n\u2018Best friends\u2019, alliance networks, where overseas offices are controlled by local partnerships but \nintegrated to form a global network operating under one name; and (c) membership of global \nlegal associations where every firm is independent and members call on one-another to assist \nwith cross-border transactions.  All of the firms studied here use the \u2018global firm\u2019 strategy.  In \n\u2018alliance networks\u2019 and \u2018global legal associations\u2019 knowledge management and leverage is more \ndifficult and less common as each office operates as a relatively independent unit. \n 9 \n\u2022 Understanding the social constitution of the \u2018transnational \ncommunities of practice\u2019 that form \u2018social spaces of learning\u2019 \n(Morgan, 2001).   \n\u2022 Deconstructing the troublesome local-tacit\/global-explicit \ndichotomy (Allen, 2002). \n \nIt is, therefore, possible to draw upon and develop these ideas to analyse the \nrelational knowledge production networks in transnational legal PSFs.  However, \na number of further points need to be considered to both fully explain the \nconstitution of the networks that produce competitive advantage through global \nrelational interdependency and their specific characteristics in transnational law \nfirms.   \n \n2.1) Architectures of knowledge production in global organizations \nStudies of strategic organizational forms (Nohria and Ghoshal, 1997) \nhave, most recently, suggested that the transnational organizational architecture \nis most valuable because of its ability to create a matrix of knowledge \ninterconnections.  First proposed by Bartlett and Ghoshal (1998), \ntransnationalism allows \u2018knowledge diffusion and development worldwide\u2019 by \nintegrating and connecting all parts of a global firm\u2019s network, thus allowing the \nsynergism of ideas, insights and experiences.  Bunnell and Coe (2001, 570) \ntherefore argue that effective innovation \u201cinvolve[s] a complex and evolving \nintegration, at different levels, of local, national and global factors [not] \n 10 \nexclusively at one particular scale but instead across various spatial scales \nsimultaneously\u201d.   \n  Central to such studies have been examinations of the role of various \nforms of \u2018transnational community\u2019 (Amin and Cohendet, 2004; Bunnel and Coe, \n2001; Faulconbridge, 2006; Morgan, 2001; Wenger et al. 2000).  This work \nilluminates two related issues.  First, the modes of interconnectivity that allows \ncommunity members to communicate.  Here the rise of, and improvements in, \ninformation and communications technologies have been noted and their ability \nto support the construction of the communities that allow knowledge production \nand circulation.  Technologies ranging from the telephone to the Internet and \nvideoconferencing mean that knowledge production \u201cincludes, yes, face-to-face \nmeetings, sociality, and casual contact\u2026but it also draws on distant objects such \nas drawings faxed between offices around the world, global travel to form \ntemporary project teams, and daily internet\/telephone\/video conversations\u201d (Amin \nand Cohendet, 2004,110).  Grabher\u2019s (2002) work on project team architectures \nin PSFs reinforces this view, highlighting in particular the value of consolidated \ninter-personal networks for organizational learning.   \nSecond, studies have also highlighted the composition of transnational \ncommunities and the forces binding members together and allowing learning to \nbe stretched across space.  In particular, the vital gelling agent for such \ncommunities has been shown to be shared domains of interest emerging from \nshared work and professional practices.  Wenger et al. (2000, 25) note that \n\u201c[w]hat allows members to share knowledge is not the choice of a specific form of \n 11 \ncommunication (face-to-face as opposed to Web-based, for instance) but the \nexistence of a shared practice \u2013 a common set of situations, problems and \nperspectives\u201d.  Consequently, the spatial distribution of communities becomes \nirrelevant.  Instead, shared practice ties communities together and creates a form \nof relational proximity that ensures learning is successful (Blanc and Sierra, \n1999). \nThese approaches are useful in understanding the way transnational law \nfirms organise because of the need for cooperation and collaboration between \nlawyers in different offices throughout the world.  One of the principal aims of \ntransnational law firms is to develop transnational structures for corporate \nactivities, e.g. a framework that allows the merger of two firms originating in \ndifferent countries.  In order to do this, lawyers in several offices work together in \n\u2018project teams\u2019 (Grabher, 2002).  As one firm\u2019s promotional literatures argue, \n\u201cWorking together as one firm means we: all take responsibility for, identify with, \nand share in the success of, A&O; ensure a good team spirit, openness and \nfriendliness in the workplace; make it fun to work at, and with, A&O; help support \neach other and take pride in each other's success; put the interests of A&O \nahead of any individual or group within it\u201c \n(http:\/\/www.allenovery.com\/asp\/general.asp?pageid=1926&languageid=0 \n[accessed 12\/02\/2006]).   \nOf course, it is always important to be critical of such corporate rhetoric.  \nThe empirical material presented in the second half of this paper, therefore, \nallows the nuances of such team-working to be unpacked in more detail.  It also \n 12 \nfills the current void in research providing a micro-scale view of the type of \nrelationships involved in such transnational communities, the practices involved \nin collaboration and the socio-political influences on this process.  As noted \nabove, literatures have been quick to note the existence of such communities \nand their modes of operation (e.g. the use of email, telephone etc.).  However, \nlittle attention has been paid to the intricacies of their construction and the fine \ngrained and ongoing social complexities of these transnational communities.  \nUnpacking this is essential if we are to develop analyses of the construction of \ntime and space through social practice that others have proposed (e.g. Amin, \n2002).   \n \n2.2) Embedded and relational geographies \nAs noted above, the turn in economic geography towards a relational \nanalysis of global organizations also provides a useful conceptual backdrop \nagainst which to explore the spaces of social action making up relational \nknowledge networks (Bathelt and Glucker, 2003; Boggs and Rantisi, 2003; Peck \nand Yeung, 2003).  Such work points to how \u201c[f]irms\u2026become circulatory \nnetworks\u2026flow and mobility are increasingly assumed into the system, with \nelaborate schemes in place to ensure the rapid transfer of people, goods, money \nand information around the world\u201d (Amin, 2002, 394).  Consequently, we must \nlook at the human actors in detail and their practices that enable such circulatory \nspaces to emerge so as to avoid \u201cdescend[ing] into a mechanistic \n 13 \nframework\u2026without a sense of the social processes that constitute these \nrelationships\u201d (Dicken et al. 2001, 105).   \nIt has also been cautioned, however, that as part of meeting this challenge \nthere must be exploration of the economic, cultural, political and social \nconstitution and inflection of relational networks.  Yeung (2004, 38) argues there \nis a need to explore their \u2018relational geometries\u2019 to understand \u201cthe spatial \nconfigurations of heterogeneous relations among actors and structures through \nwhich power and identities are played out and become efficacious\u201d.  Hess (2004) \nattempts to deal with this challenge by treating the sociological concept of \nembeddedness as processual in character and exploring the ways social \nrelationships between economic actors are influenced by embedded economic \nforms.  Utilising the concept of the \u2018rhizome\u2019, Hess (2004, 179-180) proposes that \nrelational network processes are affected in an ongoing and contested fashion by \nforms of social, cultural, political and economic inflection that affect both \ninteractions in and outcomes of relational network economies.   \nIt seems, then, that a tri-part analysis is needed.  First, of the practices \ninvolved in \u2018producing\u2019 relational connectivity.  Second, of the heterogeneous \nnature of the actors and their interactions in relational networks.  This requires us \nto recognise the contingent and continuous (re)production of meaning in \nrelational networks.  And, third, of the outcomes and ordering effects of the \nrelational forms that emerge.  Law firms provide an ideal case study to put such a \ntri-part analysis into practice.  Economic value is created in transnational law \nfirms, and transnational legal services are only possible, when complex webs of \n 14 \nsocial relations are established between lawyers in different parts of the World.  \nExploring the makeup of the relational networks that facilitate this business model \nis likely to further demystify the practices involved in, and the influences upon, \nnetwork formation and the complex relational geometries involved.  Of course, to \ndo this requires an explanation grounded in an understanding of the \ncontemporary context of the legal industry, something that further emphasises \nthe importance of not only analysing the form of relational networks but also their \nwider role in the structuring of the global economy.   \n       \n2.3) Relational networks and the (re)production of legal practices  \nA key issue highlighted by studies of the sociology of the legal profession \nhas been the affect of globalization on the organization of law firms and \nprofessional practice (e.g. Brock et al, 1999; The Economist, 1996).  In particular, \nit has been suggested that this has led to a form of \u2018Americanization\u2019 whereby \nUS, and more recently UK firms dominate most cross-border corporate legal \nwork and influence the nature and culture of such legal practice.  As Trubek et al. \n(1994, 420) argue, there is a need to tell the \u201cstory of the growing dominance of a \nparticular mode of production of law which began in the United States\u201d (Trubek et \nal. 1994, 420).   \nThe leading transnational law firms (table 1) and their organizational \ncharacteristics are the result of the development, during the mid part of the \ntwentieth century, of a form of legal practice that is often referred to as \n\u2018Cravathism\u2019 and \u2018mega-lawyering\u2019 (Trubek et al. 1994; Spar, 1997).  Under such \n 15 \na schema, lawyers provide commercially sensitive advice to clients that is \ndesigned to provide positive business outcomes.  In particular, it means avoiding \nposturing about legal positionalities and academic-style debates about \nlegislation.  Instead, focus is placed upon finding the most effective way to apply, \nand operate within the law so as to meet the client\u2019s commercial needs2.   \n \n[Insert table 1 here] \n \nAfter emerging in the USA and particularly in New York\u2019s law firms \n(Smigel, 1965), such a system quickly spread to the UK as globalizing US and \nincreasingly UK clients demanded such commercially orientated legal advice3.  \nThe Economist (1996) suggested US and UK transnational legal PSFs \u2018wrapped \nred tape around the World\u2019 and effectively created a captive market for corporate \nlegal services, a market based on the principles of the Cravath, mega-law, \napproach.  In stark contrast, many other civil law European jurisdictions (e.g. \n                                            \n2\n Four key characteristics that differentiate \u2018mega-law\u2019 firms from their counterparts can be \nidentified based on the work of Flood (1996): (a) the increased size of firms; (b) specialisation in \nareas of corporate law and serving large corporate clients; (c) high levels of internal coordination; \nand (d) the increasing use of partner review and remuneration based on financial measures of \nperformance.   \n3\n The driving force behind the increase in demand for commercially sensitive legal services in the \nUK was, in particular, the growth in number of American law firms in the City of London and the \nincreased awareness of clients of the benefits of a \u2018mega-law\u2019 service.  \n 16 \nFrance, Germany and Italy) have been slower to adapt to mega-lawyering \npractices (MacDonald, 1995).   \nWhere it has and continues to occur, the propagation in transnational legal \nPSFs of \u2018mega-lawyering\u2019 practices can only be understood by examining the \norganizational structures of the law firms involved and the way they facilitate the \ncirculation of the knowledge and ideas \u2018mega-lawyering\u2019 is based upon (Nelson \nand Trubek, 1992).  As Flood (1995, 160) suggests, \u201cit may be preferable to talk \nof the export of American techniques that are adapted to local cultures and \nbecome local knowledge\u201d.  This highlights the importance of fully understanding \nthe character of the relational networks transnational law firms develop and, \nimportantly, the potential power of such structures.  Even in the more \nbeaurocratically managed professional businesses it is \u201cnetworking and \ncorporate culture [that] ensure[s] the integration of activities\u201d (Ferner et al. 2001, \n343).  Consequently, in the context of this paper, the ways such networking and \npropagation of culture is tied up with global knowledge production and circulation \nis particularly significant.   \nThe paper, therefore, draws on the frameworks outlined in this section to \nanalyse empirical material exploring the way transnational legal PSFs operating \nin London and New York engage in \u2018knowledge diffusion and development \nworldwide\u20194.  Specifically, it investigates: the way relational networks are \n                                            \n4\n The London and New York offices were chosen as: (a) they are the dominant, home-country, \noffices of global law firms; and (b) UK and New York State law dominates cross-border corporate \nlegal work in the emerging transnational legal domain (Trubek et al. 1994). \n 17 \nconstructed in these firms; the way these networks operate as social and cultural \nconstructions; and the affects on the way transnational firms produce and \nmanage knowledge worldwide on different national legal systems.  This reveals \nthe importance of focussing upon the actors and the social practices involved in \nproducing such relational network space and also the ordering capability of \nrelational networks in terms of their effect on the spread of such (American) \nmega-law practices. \n \n3) Methodology \nThe empirical material analysed in this paper was collected through 29 \nsemi-structured interviews conducted between September 2003 and June 2004.  \nInterviewees held various positions in transnational legal PSFs operating in \nLondon and New York ranging from associate (the most junior rank) to managing \npartner (the most senior rank).  The lawyers interviewed had between six and \nthirty years experience (fifteen years on average) and had worked for between \none and four firms (two on average).  All specialised in either corporate or finance \nlaw.   \nIndividuals were selected using the following strategy.   Company web \nsites of the top twenty \u2018transnational\u2019 firms, ranked by number of offices, were \nconsulted and three individuals contacted in each firm (60 in total).  First, the \nmanaging partner.  Second, a partner from either the corporate or finance \npractice area, the dominant focus of lawyers\u2019 work in cities such as London and \nNew York.  Third, an associate lawyer in the corporate or finance practice group.  \n 18 \nThe corporate\/finance partners and associates were selected at random using a \nsampling strategy.  Most firms list lawyers on their websites in alphabetical order \nby office.  By consulting lists of lawyers for the London and New York offices of \neach firm a random sample was produced by contacting the first listed corporate \nor finance partner or associate.  Following this process (which resulted in 23 \ninterviewees being completed, a 38% acceptance rate), a further six lawyers \nwere recruited using the \u2018snowballing\u2019 approach.  Interviewees often \nrecommended meeting with other individuals in the firm \u2013 for example, those \nlawyers involved in knowledge management activities \u2013 and, where possible, \nthese contacts were followed up.  In total, at least one lawyer was interviewed in \n11 out of the top 20 firms5. At the time of completing interview these firms had \nbetween 11 and 69 offices worldwide, employed between 573 and 3,053 lawyers \nand had global revenues of between \u00a3174m and \u00a3950m (The Lawyer, 2004).   \nAn interview schedule was used that explored the practices involved in \nlearning and knowledge management in transnational law firms.  Following the \nlogic of \u2018new economic geography\u2019 (Yeung, 2003), the intention was to let \ninterviewees \u2018speak for themselves\u2019 and openly describe the practices and \nprocesses relevant to the issues being researched.  As the interviews formed \npart of a wider project, interviewees were asked to describe all the \u2018spaces\u2019 in \nwhich learning or knowledge management activities took place.  The responses \nof interviewees generally led to discussions of practices within three main \n                                            \n5\n There was no trend in terms of the size, country of origin or any other factor in the firms where \nno lawyers were interviewed. \n 19 \nspaces: (a) the offices of the firm they worked for; (b) the city spaces they worked \nin and the various arenas of learning within these cities; and (c) the transnational \ncorporate networks of the firms they worked for.  In each case interviewees were \nprobed about the situations in which learning occurred, what affected whether it \noccurred, the influences and limits on the success of learning and the benefit \ngained from the enactment of learning practices within each space.  Where \npractical, \u2018validation\u2019 questions (Schoenburger, 1991) were inserted into the \ninterview schedule in an attempt to identify and filter-out corporate rhetoric that \ncould potentially cloud the picture presented6.  By the end of the process, the \nresearcher felt \u2018theoretical saturation\u2019 had been achieved as the same themes \nand ideas were repeatedly emerging with limited amounts of novel data (Glaser \nand Strauss, 1967).  By interviewing individuals in various positions of authority it \nwas possible to include multiple voices and perspectives. Only discussions \nrelating to space (c) are reported here with other findings reported elsewhere \n(Faulconbridge, 2007, forthcoming). \nInterviews lasted between 40 and 90 minutes (55 minutes on average) \nand were tape recorded.  Quotes representing key issues and ideas were then \nextracted from the transcripts produced using the logic of grounded theory \n(Glaser and Strauss, 1967).  This involved a recursive process that initially \nhighlighted key themes in the empirical data and then coded transcripts \n                                            \n6\n Schoenburger (1991) suggests \u2018validation questions\u2019 are questions used to address a topic \ncovered earlier in the interview but from a different perspective.  This allows the researcher to \ncross-verify the responses and ideas presented to check for inconsistencies and responses \naimed to mislead.   \n 20 \nappropriately.  Quotes, both supporting and contradicting the main arguments \nwere then used to tease out the processes, practices and socio-political \ninfluences upon the learning process7.  To maintain the anonymity of \ninterviewees only interviewee number is provided in this analysis.  Where \nrelevant, the position of the interviewee within the firm is also identified.   \n \n4) Transnational learning and organizational networks in legal PSFs \nAt one level, it is entirely possible that transnational law firms could \noperate without tight relational couplings.  For example, legal networks such as \nThe Interlex Group simply act as transnational structures through which lawyers \ncan \u2018buy\u2019 the services of an overseas lawyer as and when needed8.  However, an \n                                            \n7\n Inevitably, as with all elite research, it is important to remain critical of the views presented.  \nData is always potentially contaminated and partial because of attempts by interviewees to retain \na degree of power in the interview relationship, maintain an image or protect the firm they work \nfor (Schoenburger, 1991; Herod, 1999).  Overall, however, the repetitiveness of the ideas \npresented in this paper would indicate the issues discussed are indicative of on goings within the \nfirms studied. It has been attempted to represent the voices of everyone interviewed, in particular \nin terms of differences in opinion depending on level of seniority in the firm.  Inevitably, it is \nimpossible to represent every contradiction appearing in the interview data.  However, where \ncontradictions repeatedly emerged they are discussed in the analysis.     \n8\n Interlex is an association of law firms located in cities throughout the World.  Its members \nspecialise in providing legal services to firms outside of their home country.  However, the group \nis not a joint venture or merger of any type.  Each firm is independent and Interlex simply acts as \nan efficient referral network whereby a law firm can locate a service provider in an overseas \n 21 \nimportant rationale and benefit of being a truly global organization, as all the firms \nin table 1 are, is the advantage gained from tightly coupled, established and \nongoing relational ties between lawyers in different offices.  These allow learning \nwith and from overseas colleagues in a way that creates competitive advantage \nand improves the effectiveness of the services provided to clients.  As two \ninterviewees described the way they engaged in globally stretched knowledge \nproduction and circulation: \n\u201cOften there are particular factors, particular approaches, that have been used in \nanother jurisdiction which have not been used in this particular jurisdiction but are \neasily transportable.  And the way you get that is you talk through your problem \nwith fellow partners in other jurisdictions, draw on their experience and \nsuggestions and feed that in\u201d (4). \n \n\u201cSo, you might have a lawyer whose done certain types of work, they speak to \nanother lawyer whose done a certain types of work, and between them by talking \nthings through, by sharing their experiences they actually work out something \ninnovative...So when you\u2019re up against a problem, first you walk down the \ncorridor and talk to your colleagues, but if they can\u2019t find a solution, and you think \nthere is more mileage to be had out of this, you pick up the phone and talk to the \npartners who you think might have something to offer here, and they might be in \nGermany, in New York, or in France\u201d (9). \n \n                                                                                                                                  \ncountry in which they do not have an office.  There is no attempt to integrate the firms or develop \nongoing relationships of any kind.    \n 22 \nThese quotes provide a number of insights.  First, they reveal that lawyers in \nglobally integrated firms use their relational networks to benefit from knowledge \nproduction and circulation (i.e. developing new understanding based on the \nsynergism of experiences and ideas and passing on extant knowledge so that it \ncan be adopted, adapted and reconstituted by overseas colleagues).  Second, \nthe quotes indicate that creating the architectures (Amin and Cohendet, 1999) \nand networks (Skymre, 1999) that facilitate this knowledge production and \ncirculation process is critical.  In particular, they reveal that it is the way \nindividuals within global organizations construct and benefit from various inter-\npersonal relationships with colleagues that ensure intra-organizational learning \noccurs.  These relationships are often supported by non-human actors such as \nemails, documents detailing case study transactions or innovations in legal \npractice, and reference to professional publications such as The Lawyer and The \nLaw Gazette. Reading such documents helps establish a common-base for \nunderstanding and, for the case studies written by colleagues within the firm, \nhelps develop understanding of a colleague\u2019s past experience and approach to \nlegal problems. However, as one interviewee noted: \n\u201c\u2026it [reading things] will never replace giving the guy a ring and saying \u2018what\u2019s \nthe counsel you can offer?\u2019  And it\u2019s quite interesting when they write up the \nknowledge and learning\u2019s, inevitably these things are interesting but pretty \nvanilla, the lumps and bumps are taken out of everything when a report or review \nis written.  And you only get the lumps and bumps or the local colour as it were \nby actually talking to people.  So actually building up a network of contacts is \nyour life saver\u201d (23). \n \n 23 \nInterviewees were, therefore, further interrogated about the ways these all-\nimportant interpersonal networks are formed, embedded and used so as to \ncreate time and space through which knowledge and its production can be \nstretched.  \n \n4.1) Relational network forming practices \nThe networks that allow knowledge production and circulation result from \nindividuals developing awareness of, and relationships with colleagues who have \nexpertise and knowledge relevant to one specialist area of legal practice.  \nLawyers in transnational corporate law firms specialise in both legal practice \nareas (e.g. antitrust\/competition; banking and finance; M&A\/corporate; tax) and \nindustry domains (e.g. airlines; financial institutions; real estate).  It is essential \nthat they know the other lawyers in the firm who specialise in their practice and \nindustry areas.  In the law firms studied, this awareness emerged in two ways. \nFirst, transactional encounters, when individuals from several offices work \ntogether on a cross-border project involving several legal jurisdictions.  Second, \nnon-transactional encounters such as telephone calls resulting from the \ndeliberative searching of an \u2018expertise database\u20199.  Grabher (2002) refers to this \nas \u2018know-who\u2019 knowledge and highlights a similar process in advertising PSFs.   \nTable 2 provides several quotes that exemplify this process in more detail.  \nAs it makes clear, cultivating such relationships is central to creating spaces in \n                                            \n9\n Expertise databases existed in all of the firms studied.  They list individuals working for the firm \nand their practice and industry speciality as well as past transactional experience.  \n 24 \nwhich stretched learning can take place.  Inevitably, the geography of these \nnetwork spaces reflects the spatially patchy networks of transnational legal PSFs \n(Beaverstock et al. 1999). However, as figure 1 suggests, despite the \nsignificance of South East Asia in the activities of transnational law firms, \ninterpersonal networks stretched principally between: the London and New York \noffices; and the London, New York and continental European offices.  It was \nsomewhat surprising that the South East Asian offices of these firms were not as \nintensely tied into knowledge production and circulation in the same was as the \nNorth American, UK and Western European offices.  This was the unavoidable \nconsequence, however, of the failure to construct the type of relational spaces \nbetween these and other offices.  A number of factors seem responsible for this \nand are discussed more fully later in the paper.  The important point is that figure \n1 clearly highlights the need to produce space in global organizations through the \nsocial practices of key actors. \n \n[Insert table 2 here] \n \n[Insert figure 1 here] \n \n4.2) Embedded relational knowledge networks \nFigure 1 also shows that it is important to recognise qualitative differences \nin the nature and form of the relational networks between different offices.  For \nexample, it suggests that the relationships between the New York and Eastern \n 25 \nEuropean offices are \u2018weaker\u2019 than those between New York and Western \nEuropean offices.  This point deserves further examination, something that \nrequires an understanding of the role of embeddedness in relational networks.  In \nparticular, the emergence of what Hess (2004) refers to as \u2018transnational \nembeddedness\u2019 is important whereby ongoing stretched social practices produce \nsocio-economic conditions that mediate effective relational action.   \nThe empirical material revealed that, while the establishment of the \nnetworks that allow global knowledge production and circulation is essential, this \nwas only half of the story.  To begin, the effectiveness of these networks was \nsuggested, by all but a minority of interviewees, to be based on the strength of \nthe social relations constituting the network.  Lawyers all recognised the \nimportance of cultivating relationships with their overseas colleagues that were \nnot simply based on functional, transactional, necessity.  Instead, they suggested \nrelationships had to be developed over extended periods for non-transactional \npurposes (i.e. for cultivating \u2018non-contractual\u2019 social and professional \nrelationships).  As two lawyers commented: \n\u201cA lot of the work we do if cross border so we\u2019re constantly working with these \nguys.  So without any deliberate intention to pick yourself a little group of buddies \n[and] you probably end up with these cross office networks.  So there\u2019s a partner \nin New York that always uses me and I use him because we have this thing \ngoing on\u201d (8).    \n \n\u201cWorking in the M&A practice there are certain people working in that area and \nyou get familiar with them and the more you work with them the more you get \n 26 \ncomfortable with them and can develop things.  I think it\u2019s really important that \nyou can develop these professional relationships that are more than just forced \ncollaborations\u201d (11). \n \nIt further emerged that these types of relationship are only successful when they \nare matured over time to create: trust-based bonds between individuals; a \nreciprocal desire to help one-another; and a belief in both the intentions of and \nadvice given by a colleague.  This mirrors the typologies of trust and its influence \nthat others have described as being critical for the effective operation of relational \norganizational forms (Murphy, 2006). Lawyers argued, however, that creating \nsuch embedded relationships was not a simple process.  In particular, success \nwas a result of the way these individuals engaged in two principal practices, both \nof which help create trusting and reciprocal relationships between individuals and \noften rely on support from non-human actors.   \nFirst, regular virtual interaction that allows one-to-one communication \nbetween individuals was as being essential.  This allows the maturation of \nnetwork ties and all lawyers suggested that cementing inter-personal \nrelationships and developing their social foundations began with one-to-one \ninteractions by telephone.  Here, as more than one interviewee put it, individuals \ncould \u2018check each other out\u2019; begin to develop an understanding of one-another\u2019s \nexpertise and personal characteristics.  By engaging in such interactions on a \nregular basis (daily with the most important \u2018network ties\u2019 when working together \non a transaction and at minimum weekly) interpersonal networks began to \n 27 \ndevelop and over time the socially embedding features described above \nemerged10.  As one lawyer described these embedded networks:     \n\u201cSo I talk to the same people probably two or three times a week at least and it\u2019s \nalways the same people who ask me questions and it\u2019s always them I call when \nI\u2019ve got a question.  It just works best that way because it\u2019s based on a social \nbond, some kind of solid relationship\u201d (21). \n \nOf course, such activities are also supplemented by regular email interactions \nand, as noted above, the sharing of useful case studies. These (non-human) \ntechnologies further reinforce the relationships formed through the telephone \nconversations that act as the backbone of embedded relationships because of \nthe spontaneous discussion they enable. This line of enquiry also revealed an \nimportant role for a second practice that further advances the embedding \nprocess.   \nSecond, then, occasional face-to-face encounters were unanimously \nhighlighted by lawyers as playing a pivotal role in further ensuring the knowledge \nproducing networks are embedded in the strongest and most effective social \nspaces possible.  For the lawyers interviewed, business travel was a fundamental \naspect of working for a global organization.  Of those involved in this research, all \n                                            \n10\n Of course, not all relationships were successful.  However, most lawyers argued it made good \nbusiness sense to do everything possible to develop such relationships, even when there were \napparent clashes in personal characteristics.  Indeed, persevering to develop socially embedded \nrelationships could help overcome some difficulties in interpersonal relationships between \nlawyers.  This is discussed further in a latter section of the paper.  \n 28 \ntravelled at least once a year whilst some (five interviewees) travelled over eight \ntimes a year and one travelled at least once a month (12 times a year).  The \nfrequency varied with seniority (see below) but in all cases business travel was \nrecognised as an important activity for two reasons.  First, it helps smooth cross-\nborder transactions.  Meeting clients and other members of a cross-border \nproject team face-to-face allows the ironing out of the most complex issues in a \ntransaction.  Second, it further helps embed the relationships involved in \nknowledge production and circulation.  Surprisingly, as much emphasis was \nplaced on the second benefit as the first, with senior lawyers arguing that \nalthough the cost of business travel was not to be taken lightly, travel to \u2018network\u2019 \nwith colleagues was a legitimate expense because of how it \u2018ties\u2019 the global \nnetwork together.  One partner likened it to turning contacts with overseas \ncolleagues from \u2018pins in a map\u2019 to genuinely meaningful relationships.   \nReflecting these ideas, all lawyers noted that their employers organized a \nrange of opportunities to meet overseas colleagues.  These included: global \ninduction meetings where new recruits meet their overseas counterparts; global \npartner and practice group conferences (sometimes referred to as retreats); and \naway-day activities in overseas offices (used mostly to embed networks between \nEuropean offices where day-trips were possible).  As two lawyers described the \nbenefits gained: \n\u201cWe have a global partner conference, we have these other conferences with \ndifferent practice groups and I suspect they are more successful because they \nare relaxed.  You all work in the same practice area and have been in contact \nwith one-another at some point, and that gives a degree of informality to it.  Then, \n 29 \nhaving dinner together, getting drunk together is the best way to develop it.  I \nthink that\u2019s probably the key, seeing people outside of the work context and really \ngetting to know them, you know getting under their skins and letting them get \nunder yours\u201d (12). \n \n\u201c\u2026our team is pretty good at trying to meet people, get out and about.  Three of \nus went to [European place x] last week just to meet them\u2026My point of view is its \nbrilliant because now if I\u2019ve got a problem, I\u2019ve pretty much met everybody from \nthat office, and they\u2019ll be no problem, we\u2019ll get on, feel like we understand one-\nanother hopefully\u201d (17, lawyer in London). \n \nIt was the combination of telephone mediated interactions and these face-to-face \nencounters that embedded the most successful knowledge producing and \ncirculating networks.  In this sense, it could be argued that telephone mediated \ninteractions begin the process of \u2018thickening up\u2019 or \u2018embedding\u2019 relational \nnetworks in organizations whilst face-to-face contact finalises the social \nconstruction process.  Initial contact by telephone allows a tentative social bond \nto be cultivated and provides an opportunity for reciprocity to develop and an \nawareness of shared interests to grow.  Moreover, respect for one-another\u2019s work \nand professionalism can be nurtured when such interactions lead to mutual \nbenefit, for example allowing a client\u2019s needs to be met more effectively.  Face-\nto-face meetings then allow these tentative feelings and beliefs to be concretised.  \nWhilst telephone interactions allowed an individual\u2019s character to be judged, all \ninterviewees agreed that \u2018seeing them in the flesh\u2019 and \u2018the whites of their eyes\u2019 \n 30 \nhelped confirm these preliminary feelings and beliefs and reinforce the \ncommitment they had to the relationship.  These are commonly recognised \nbenefits associated with embodied encounters (Urry, 2004).  As one interviewee \nput it:  \n\u201cWe had some of our UK competition lawyers over from Brussels a few weeks \nago for a training session and we never got to introduce each other to each \nother\u2026And as it happens, as everyone started to work out who was who, they\u2019d \nall had a lot to do with each other.  The relationships were already partially built, \nthey didn\u2019t start afresh once they had met face-to-face, they just consolidated it \nand made it stronger\u201d (8). \n \n4.3) The affects of embeddedness       \nIn order to better understand the affects of the differentiated forms of \nrelational network highlighted in figure 1, it is useful to further examine the \noutcomes of such embedded and consolidated interpersonal relationships and \nrelational action.  This can be illustrated by the affects on some of the key \ndifficulties that arise when globally stretched collaboration and learning takes \nplace.   \nFor just over half of the lawyers interviewed, the inter-personal networks \nthat allow knowledge production and circulation had, in the past, been in some \nway affected by disagreements, conflicts of opinion or misunderstanding between \nparties.  However, these individuals also described how strongly embedded \nrelationships could overcome such difficulties and prevent such issues inhibiting \n 31 \nstretched learning.  A number of examples highlight the affect of embedded \nrelational forms on such difficulties.   \nFirst, lawyers commented upon disagreements that emerged because of \nthe differentiated behaviours and norms associated with legal practice throughout \nthe World.  In particular, interviewees regularly noted that corporate transactions \nare approached differently in US, UK and continental European jurisdictions \nrespectively11.  Without meaning to typify or excessively simplify the differences, \nthe approaches can be summarised as follows: in the US lawyers respond to a \nproblem by finding a solution; in the UK lawyers speculate about a likely solution; \nin continental Europe lawyers\u2019 state the legal position (in an academic style \nanalysis of legal precedent and statues) and why that causes a problem.  They \ndo not suggest a solution.  This can lead to difficulties and frustration when \nlawyers work together.   \nThis issue can be understood through a range of extant studies, including \nthose of professional cultures (Torstendahl, 1990) and the differences between \ncivil and common law practice styles (Abel and Lewis, 1995).  It also relates to \nthe previous discussion of the emergence of \u2018mega law\u2019 from the USA.  However, \nof most interest to our discussion here is the way such difficulties were overcome \nin embedded networks.  Lawyers suggested it was possible to excuse such \ndifferences, tolerate them and prevent them from damaging the effectiveness of \n                                            \n11\n Continental European refers primarily to offices in the following cities in Western Europe: \nAmsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Budapest, Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan, Pairs, Prague, Rome and \nStockholm. Eastern European offices are now growing in importance and the same challenges \nare increasingly being experienced here too.  \n 32 \ninter-personal networks when relationships were embedded in the ways \ndescribed above.  As one noted: \n\u201c\u2026the cultural thing means that integrating with these people is vital\u2026So they do \nhave different styles, you don\u2019t try and impose a single style on them because \nthat would be wrong\u2026it can make things hard at times though, they just don\u2019t \nwork like we do, but you expect it and deal with it\u2026It\u2019s a translation exercise, and \nits constantly developing.  So there is if you like a willingness to accommodate \ncultural differences because if you know them you can understand and almost \nexpect these differences and then cope with them\u201d (12). \nThis highlights, then, the ways that processes of transnational embeddedness \nfacilitate learning by creating trust and commitment but also by helping overcome \nthe inevitable difficulties associated with interpersonal relationships in an \neconomic context (Murphy, 2006).  Such challenges are exaggerated in \nrelationships stretched across space because of the unavoidable variations in \napproaches and priorities of individuals working in different markets and legal \n(jurisdictional) contexts, what Hess (2004) calls the \u2018societal embeddedness\u2019 of \nrelational network forms.  \u2018Transnational\u2019 embeddedness can help create \ntolerance and even forgiveness, something potentially absent in purely \ntransaction network forms such as informal legal networks like The Interlex \nGroup.   \nTable 3 provides further examples of the types of challenges embedded \nrelational networks can overcome.  All in all, it is clear that the creation of \nrelational organizational space and time is a heterogeneous process that is \nnegotiated differently across relational networks.  The empirical material points to \n 33 \nthe importance of focussing upon the various actors and the way their actions \nconstruct space and time in which knowledge can be produced and \u2018flowed\u2019.                           \n \n[Insert table 3 here] \n \n5) Power, politics and inequality in relational networks \nWhilst the value of relational network forms was undisputed by lawyers, it \nwas also clear that certain features of the networks could alter the dynamics of \nthe relationships between actors.  In particular, the networks were affected by: (a) \ndifferent levels of inclusion in network constructing practices; and (b) uneven \ngeographies of power constructed by actors and groups of actors in the \nnetworks.  Both of these factors further highlight the need to complicate the \nanalysis of global organizational networks so as to recognise the intricacies of the \nconstruction of relational spaces by key actors and the ordered preconditions and \noutcomes of relational interactions. \n \n5.1) Exclusivity in network forms \nTwo factors were of particular significance in determining the value of \nrelational networks and the level of inclusion of different individuals in network \nconstructing practices.  Both factors augured against the successful construction \nand exploitation of interpersonal networks by junior lawyers.  First, junior lawyers \n(i.e. non-partners) were only able to develop networks with other non-partners.  \nThis in itself has value, but is of exponentially less value than talking to partners \n 34 \nwho are inevitably the most knowledgeable individuals in law firms (Hatsopoulos \nand Hatsopoulos, 1999) and have extensive and valuable \u2018grey hair\u2019 experience \nthat can be learned from (Terret, 1998).  Whilst partners would happily work with \nand advise associates in relation to a transaction, associates found it impossible \nto further these inter-personal networks and transform them into the type of \nsocially embedded professional relationships essential for effective knowledge \nproduction and circulation.  They suggested this could be explained by their \ninability to overcome the invisible walls created by the time honoured \n\u2018hierarchical\u2019 conditions common to law firms (Smigel, 1965).  As two junior \nlawyers commented: \n\u201cI think culture does have to be changed to make partners realise that they have \nto share their knowledge with everyone not just the other partners\u2026 partners will \nhave all the really valuable knowledge and won\u2019t pass it on to the likes of \nus\u2026they don\u2019t want to share their knowledge because knowledge is all \nimportant\u2026sometimes I think they want to walkout the door with all of it so no \njuniors can depose them.  I guess the threat\u2019s not the same when it comes to \nsharing insights with someone who\u2019s already a partner\u201d (7). \n \n\u201cYeah I think they [well cultivated, socially embedded inter-personal networks] \nbecome more effective the more senior you get.  It must be very helpful for \npartners to have people to draw on, and they\u2019re always asking favours of their \npartner colleagues.  We can\u2019t do that, we just muddle on through as a group of \nassociates\u201d (14). \n \n 35 \nThis politics of exclusion was also created and reinforced by a second factor.  \nJunior lawyers commented that business travel was more limited for them than \nfor partners.  They fell at the bottom end of the frequency range for travel.  Those \njunior lawyers interviewed all travelled between one and three times a year.  Most \ntransactional travel (in relation to cross-border projects) was completed by \npartners because of their dominant role in client handling and legally complex \nsituations.  Other forms of business travel also occurred more frequently for \npartners with, for example, conferences\/retreats occurring at least once a year.  \nIn contrast, junior lawyers were normally confined to an induction during their first \nyear of employment, an overseas \u2018seat\u2019 as part of training and occasional (often \nbi-annual) attendance at practice group meetings.  Consequently, junior lawyers \nwere less able to develop the embedded networks needed to most effectively \nbenefit from globally stretched learning.  As one junior lawyer noted: \n\u201c\u2026they\u2019re definitely attorneys who I have gotten to know through various cross-\nborder transactions but my interactions with them are more on the basis of if I\u2019ve \ngot a question on a specific point I might give them a ring\u2026most of these people \nI\u2019ve never met.  Its not uncommon for me go for a year or so without leaving New \nYork but then on the other hand the partner next door can be in five different \ncountries over the period of a month\u201d (27). \n \nA similar process is also partially responsible for the weakness of the knowledge \nnetworks interconnecting the South East Asian offices to those in Europe and \n 36 \nNorth America (figure 1)12.  Even for senior lawyers, travel to offices in South \nEast Asia (or from South East Asia to Europe or North America) was infrequent \ndue to the time and financial costs involved.  This prohibits the embedding of \nrelational networks in the same way as infrequent travel does for junior lawyers.  \nIt might also explain the important role of lawyer expatriation to South East Asian \noffices noted by Beaverstock (2004).  As stretched embedded networks are \nweak, co-presence becomes important for the transfer of expertise.   \nThis points, then, to the importance of recognising the patchiness of \nrelational network forms and, in particular, the need to move beyond using \nmappings of relational networks as proxies of globalization and global \ninterconnectivity.  The existence of a corporate office network or \u2018production \nchain\u2019 alone is insufficient evidence to claim tight integration exists.  Instead, the \nempirical material presented here would seem to suggest that an understanding \nof the socio-economic practices and the connections produced within the \nnetworks and the partial or selective forms of integration created by actors is \nimportant.   \n \n5.2) \u2018Power\u2019 in embedded networks \nIt also emerged from interviews that the networks of knowledge production \nare imbued with uneven geographies of power.  This has an important structural \n                                            \n12\n An additional factor here is the starkly different legal context in South East Asia.  Both the \nregulation of law firms and wider business systems are unlike US, UK or Continental European \napproaches (see for example Yeung, 2000).  It is, therefore, more challenging to \u2018transfer\u2019 best \npractice (c.f. Gertler, 2003). \n 37 \naffect on both the firms themselves but, also more widely, on the nature of \n\u2018global\u2019 corporate law. Of the key transnational legal PSFs listed in table 1, all \nemerged from primarily UK or US legal practices.  This leads to the \npredominance of the type of US and UK \u2018mega-lawyering\u2019 described earlier in the \npaper.  It emerged from interviews that global knowledge production and \ncirculation networks are used to encourage, in particular, continental European \noffices and increasingly offices in the East of the continental block, to adopt \nmega-lawyering practices.  This was a form of power that was predominantly \n(though not exclusively) exercised by partners in the New York offices of both US \nand UK transnational legal PSFs.  The following quotes exemplify the way the \nknowledge producing networks are used to catalyse the development of \ncorporate legal practice in Eastern Europe: \n\u201cIn a broader sense the US standards of disclosure as regards security law has \nhad a significant impact on how the rest of the world works, and especially \nmainland Europe, and so often its useful to get some idea [of] how its done\u2026and \nwe can provide that to other offices, to our colleagues\u201d (25, partner based in New \nYork). \n \n\u201c\u2026we group ourselves globally by the practice of law that we do rather than \nlocally and we talk every week about a legal issue but in each jurisdiction and \nhow that\u2019s then treated in each jurisdiction\u2026And its particularly helpful to the \noffices that are just joining the EU\u2026so we\u2019re talking to lot of country\u2019s to see if we \ncan sort them out, what\u2019s going to happen and how they should practice now.  So \nagain, sharing of experience on a cross-jurisdictional basis to develop their \npractice\u201d (18, partner based in London). \n 38 \n \nThe construction of this power is possible, firstly, because of the concentration of \ntravel within Europe by lawyers from the USA and UK for interpersonal networks \nconstruction.  For example, interviewees in New York suggested that for every \none trip to South East Asia they would make at least three trips to Europe.  \nConsequently, the embedded networks are \u2018strong\u2019 (see figure 1) and can be \neffectively used to reproduce the Cravath model of practice.   \nSecondly, this power is also constructed and reinforced by the way \npartners, in particular in the New York offices of the firms studied, depict and \nportray the continental European offices.  A form of rhetoric has developed over \ntime that constructs these offices as needing the \u2018assistance\u2019 of, in particular, the \nNew York office to deal with the complexities of global corporate transactions.  \nConsequently, Continental European offices are seen as being the benefactors of \nsuch assistance in that their legal practices and their ability to compete in a \nglobal marketplace has developed.  The recent transition of Continental \nEuropean jurisdictions towards a more corporate-orientated form of legal practice \nis undoubtedly both the justification for and outcome of this process (Morgan and \nQuack, 2005).  The way two partners working in the New York offices of \ntransnational law firms described continental European offices exemplifies this \npoint: \n\u201c\u2026by and large it\u2019s [knowledge circulation and production] traffic that goes \n[across the networks] from us to them and not to us from them.  So what most \npeople are interested in is the US aspects of or how you do something\u2026So the \nperson handing out the knowledge [in the US] might hand out five units and get \n 39 \none unit back, and I think that\u2019s to be expected\u2026 If I was in Madrid having this \nconversation I would say its incredibly important because I need these guys to \nhelp me to do what I do, and I think that\u2019s true of most offices around the world\u201d \n(23). \n \n\u201cWhen I started out if you were buying assets in Italy you would have a five page \ncontract\u2026it was simplistic, that\u2019s how people would do business\u2026And I don\u2019t \nknow if its because financing has become globalised, or people in Europe and \nAsia have kind of scratched their heads because American companies buying \nbusinesses weren\u2019t going to have a simplistic five page contract and wanted to \nwork in our way, but these countries have really moved forward since they \nlistened to our advice and ideas\u201d (29). \n \nThese \u2018structural\u2019 preconditions in transnational law firms, whereby the London \nand New York offices are seen as leaders of legal practice, results in interesting \nforms of power in the relational networks constructed.  It creates networks that \nare used to influence the way law is practiced in other jurisdictions so as to \nsmooth the completion of global transactions.  The emergence of such a \ntransnational influence over legal practice challenges what has often been seen \nas a national sphere of control in which national professional regulators and legal \nassociations have control over the practice of nationally registered lawyers. \nHowever as Morgan and Quack (2005) note in relation to law, and others have \ndescribed for finance and other industries (Bathelt and Gertler 2005; Morgan, \n2001; W\u03ccjcik, 2006), national institutional and regulatory systems are \nincreasingly influenced by transnational forces as a result of the activities of \n 40 \nTNCs. In this case it means that the global knowledge production and circulation \nnetworks of transnational law firms are often conduits for the transferral, or at \nleast the overseas re-translation, of principally US legal practice.  Consequently, \nthe advice provided to clients and the structures used for cross-border mergers, \nacquisitions, re-financings and other corporate transformations often takes a \ndistinctly US or UK style (The Economist, 1996; Trubek et al. 1994).  When \ncoupled with the corporate \u2018socialization\u2019 processes associated with work in large \nPSFs which aim to ensure all employees deliver uniform and standard services \nacross the firm\u2019s network (see Covaleski et al. 1998), this has significant \nstructural outcomes for the nature of corporate law13.  Indeed, it could be argued \nthat the globally stretched knowledge networks are partially responsible for the \n\u2018Americanization\u2019 of corporate legal practice others have noted (Trubek et al. \n1994; Flood, 1995) and that, as Morgan (2006) suggests, corporate lawyers in \ntransnatonal law firms are the forward-party of US capitalism, clearing the legal \nway for TNCs to operate using US standards that are increasingly seen as \ncapitalist \u2018best practice\u2019 throughout the world. This, then, might explain China and \nother countries reticence to fully open their legal markets to transnational firms.   \n                                            \n13\n All of the law firms studied in this research operated some form of \u2018global training\u2019 events, in \nparticular for newly recruited lawyers.  Whilst the firms did not have the type of \u2018global academy\u2019 \noften associated with accountancy firms such as PriceWaterhouseCoopers, they did use global \ngatherings as a way of training new recruits to deliver a \u2018firm x\u2019 style service.  Especially for US \noriginating firms but also for those from the UK, this was a mega-law style service. \n \n 41 \nIn this sense, the relational constitution of power is related to both \n\u2018structural\u2019 preconditions and the creation of new structures in the global space \neconomy.  Sheppard (2002) highlights how global networks often draw on and \nrecreate relationships of dependence in the global economy.  The analysis \nprovided here goes further, however, and also reveals the way relational \nnetworks can produce new forms of power laden interdependencies, creating \nnew positions of inequality and economic muscle.  As a transnational legal realm \npotentially begins to emerge (Flood, 1995, 1996; Trubek et al, 1994), US and to a \nlesser extent UK firms have used the influence of their relational networks to \ncreate and recreate a position of power for themselves.  Whilst this has been \nimplicit in the arguments put forward previously about relational networks (e.g. \nDicken et al. 2001), to date there has been a dearth of empirical analysis of such \nissues (but see Johns, 2006).   \nWe can push this analysis even further. Geographers have been reminded \nin recent times, above all by the contributions of John Allen (2002; 2003), that \ndiscussions of power need to take a more critical stance.  For Allen, power takes \nmultiple forms, something determined by the way it is exercised14.  He argues it \nis, therefore, important to begin by recognising the mode of power employed \n                                            \n14\n Allen (2003) distinguishes between authority, coercion, domination, inducement, manipulation \nand seduction as different forms of power.  Each it exercised through relationships that construct \npower in unique ways, for example using different combinations of presence to draw individuals \ninto line and constrain actions, concealment to hide intentions but manipulate individuals and \nnumerous other forms of strategic behaviour.  \n 42 \nbefore exploring the construction of powerful relations between actors and the \nactions involved in this process.   \nAccording to Allen\u2019s typology of the different forms of power, the power \nidentified in the global networks of knowledge production in this paper is a form of \ndomination.  Allen (2003, 28) suggests that where domination occurs it \u201cmay \ninvolve relationships close at hand or across vast distances, but in either case \nthe imposition of a form of conduct according to a set of particular interests is \ncharacteristic\u201d.  This is subtly different to authority.  Domination is a form of \npower accepted out of resignation to the powerful influence of the other party.  \nAuthority is power conceded because of recognition of the other parties\u2019 \nlegitimate claim to power and influence.  The way the power is constructed in the \nnetworks studied here reveals why such a distinction is important.   \nLawyers in New York acknowledged that the relationship between offices \nis one where continental European lawyers are resigned to the need to learn \nfrom and retranslate the ideas and practices produced and circulated by, in \nparticular, the New York office.  Both client demands for \u2018megalaw\u2019 style legal \nservices and the relative financial, and therefore managerial, dominance of New \nYork offices in transnational law firms\u2019 networks\u2019 create such a situation15. In \nparticular, the balance sheets detailing revenues and profits for each office that \n                                            \n15\n An example of this financial muscle can be seen in the differences in turnover between two \noffices of one global law firm.  In 2002 Shearman Sterling\u2019s New York office has a turnover of in \nexcess of \u00a3209m whilst the Paris office has a turnover of just over \u00a339.5m (The Lawyer, 2003).  \nThis is representative of the differentials between New York and continental European offices in \nall of the law firms studied.  \n 43 \nare circulated at regular intervals for all partners to peruse result in power-imbued \nrelations between offices with the nature of the relationship influenced by the \nlevel of profit generated by each office. Unsurprisingly, the most profitable offices \nare also the most influential offices, even when these are not the \u2018home country\u2019 \noffices of the firm. Consequently lawyers in New York mobilise both the need of \ntheir European counterparts to provide clients with a US style service, and the \nhigh levels of financial muscle held by the New York offices, as resources to \n\u2018exercise\u2019 power.   \nThis suggests, then, that approaching \u2018power\u2019 as a socially constructed \nand relational formation might lead us further towards understanding the power \nstructures affecting the global space economy.  It reveals the importance of \nunderstanding the interplay between extant ordering in relational networks and \nthe actions and reactions of key actors in order to fully conceptualise the \ngeographies of globalization.  This requires the type of micro-level investigation \npresented here with the actors, not just the network structures, being the focus of \nour attention.  It also further reveals the value of viewing relational networks as \nsocial constructions.  This allows us to fully explore the power geometries \nproduced through social practice and heterogeneous social relationships.   \n \n6) Discussion and conclusions \nThere has been much debate about the most effective way to \nconceptualise globalized economic activities with general agreement that \nanalysis should focus upon the intensity of connections and relations between \n 44 \nactors and places (Amin, 2002; Dicken et al. 2001; Peck and Yeung, 2003).  \nIndeed, the growing belief that a topographic imaginary is needed to effectively \nconceptualise the geographies of global activity are supported in many ways by \nthis paper.  However, the findings also point to the inherent sophistication of such \nprocesses and the need to fully understand both the forms of social practice and \nembeddedness constituting and influencing such networks.  Two main points \nhave been made here.   \nFirst, the paper offers an empirical exposition of the socially constructed \nnature of global economic activities and relational networks.  Whilst Jones \n(2005), Yeung (2004) and others have pointed to the importance of such an \napproach, there has been a dearth of the type of fine-grained analysis offered \nhere of such processes.  In this study, the knowledge production networks of \nlegal PSFs have been unpacked and shown to be socially formed and embedded \nconstructions, created through intricately managed interpersonal relationships. \nImportantly, the empirical material also highlights the importance of studying the \nvarious actors and their intentional strategies for enhancing and exploiting, \nrelational networks.  For example, the discovery of the synergistic use of social \ninteraction mediated by virtual and travel enabling technologies to construct and \nembed relational networks highlights the need to view corporate networks as \ndelicate spaces of human and non-human practice and engagement.   \nSecond, the paper also makes a significant contribution in terms of further \ndeveloping understanding of the way power affects relational networks activities.  \nIt has been shown that global relational networks operate in a recursive state, \n 45 \nboth being guided by extant ordering and socio-economic conditions but also \nreinforcing and reconstituting them.  The example of attempts to reconfigure legal \npractice in Europe through a form of \u2018Americanization\u2019 shows how positions of \npower in the global economy can be reproduced and entrenched through \nrelational networks (Allen, 2003; Sheppard, 2002).  This reinforces the value of \nfocussing upon the ongoing practices of actors within such network and their \neffects on the operation of relational economic activities and the global economy \nmore widely.   \nConsequently, there seems to be two significant areas of future research \nthat can emerge from this starting point.  First, it is clear that, for economic \ngeographers, there is still work to be done to develop our understanding of the \ngeographies and practices of knowledge production.  The findings presented \nhere tie in with Allen\u2019s (2002) call for more sensitive and elegant analyses of both \nthe way knowledge is produced and its spatialities but also suggests that beyond \ndiscussions of the geographies of tacit knowledge (Amin and Cohendet, 2004; \nGertler, 2003), there are important debates to be held about the spatial politics \nand power of networks of knowledge production and \u2018flow\u2019 in the global space \neconomy.  Approaching such questions using the type of subtle analysis \nproposed here might help in this cause. \nSecond, the research has provided detailed evidence to support calls for \nthe continued explosion of the black box used to represent firms (Jones, 2005; \nTaylor and Asheim, 2001; Yeung, 2001).  Specifically, the paper has identified \nthe need to hone in on the individual actors in relational networks processes, \n 46 \ntheir positionality and intentionality, and the affects of this on the ordering of \nrelational networks themselves and wider economic arenas.  Together, such \napproaches might further help us demystify the affects of relational organizational \nforms on the geographies of economic activity.   \n                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe comments provided by Jon Beaverstock on earlier draft of this paper were most \nhelpful, as were the comments of two of the anonymous referees who further sharpened \nthe focus of the paper.

If you came to me and said \u2018is that a \npencil?\u2019 you would expect me to say \u2018no that\u2019s not a \npencil it\u2019s a tea spoon\u2019.  If you went to a lawyer in \nKazakhstan he\u2019d probably say \u2018no\u2019.  So the Anglo-\nSaxon lawyer expects to go beyond the specific \nquestion and discuss what the issue is.  That\u2019s a \nterrible over simplification and it\u2019s changed a great \ndeal and we understand the difference but also \nincreasingly find those lawyers we work with best \nrealise that the expectation that you will get to the \nbottom of the real issue in London, New York, \nSydney has to be met elsewhere.  The expectation is \nproblem solving rather than giving advice.\u201d (5). \n \n \nTrusting the advice given by overseas colleagues.  \nAs it is difficult to assess the advice given by a \ncolleague, it is necessary to wholeheartedly believe \nin the suggestions made during conversations.  \n \n\u201cTrust is incredibly important so people trust that \nknowledge because otherwise they\u2019re not going to \nuse it.  It\u2019s a matter of building up trusts, building \nup relationships\u2026That familiarity, that ability to \njudge the person, to judge whether they\u2019re taking \nthe right decisions\u201d (7). \n \n \nReceiving timely advice.  Embedded relationships \nprovide an impetus for an overseas lawyer to \nrespond quickly and with the most effective advice.  \n  \n \n\u201cFor example, there\u2019s the culture of the August \nholiday and in Italy, and unless you\u2019ve got some \nvery close contacts you\u2019ll get nothing during those \nmonths unless it\u2019s prearranged.  That\u2019s no use if a \ndeal suddenly comes up or you need support \nquickly.
