Since the resistivities of earth materials are sensitive to \nthe presence of contaminants and their break-down products, 4-dimensional resistivity \nimaging can act as a surrogate monitoring technology for tracking and visualising \nchanges in contaminant concentrations at much higher spatial and temporal resolution \nthan manual intrusive investigations. The test site, a municipal car-park built on a \nformer gas-works, had been polluted by a range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \nand dissolved phase contaminants. It was designated statutory contaminated land \nunder Part IIA of the UK Environmental Protection Act due to the risk of polluting an \nunderlying minor aquifer. Resistivity monitoring zones were established on the \nboundaries of the site by installing vertical electrode arrays in purpose-drilled \nboreholes. After a year of monitoring data had been collected, a tracer test was \nperformed to investigate groundwater flow velocity and to demonstrate rapid \nvolumetric monitoring of natural attenuation processes. A saline tracer was injected \ninto the confined aquifer, and its motion and evolution were visualised directly in \nhigh-resolution tomographic images in near real-time. Breakthrough curves were \ncalculated from independent resistivity measurements, and the estimated seepage \nvelocities from the monitoring images and the breakthrough curves were found to be \nin good agreement with each other and with estimates based on the piezometric \ngradient and assumed material parameters. \nKeywords: Electrical Resistivity Tomography; Timelapse; 3D; 4D; Environmental \nMonitoring; Tracer; Natural Attenuation \nIntroduction \nThe use of Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to study near-surface \nhydrogeological characteristics and processes over a range of spatial and temporal \nscales has been an area of active research for more than a decade. As resistivity \ndepends on properties such as saturation, solute concentration and temperature, \ntimelapse ERT can be used to monitor natural and anthropogenic processes that cause \nchanges in these properties, such as infiltration (Daily et al., 1992; Looms et al., \n2008), saline intrusion (Slater and Sandberg, 2000; Ogilvy et al., 2007; 2008), \nleachate recirculation (Guerin et al., 2004), and contaminated land remediation (Daily \nand Ramirez, 1995; LaBrecque et al., 1996; Slater and Binley, 2003; Halihan et al., \n2005, Wilkinson et al., 2008). \nTimelapse ERT provides dynamic volumetric information while being either non-\ninvasive (when using surface electrodes) or minimally invasive (with borehole \nelectrodes). Therefore this method is well suited to monitoring tracer tests as part of \nhydrogeological site investigations. It typically gives much higher spatial resolution \nthan geochemical sampling via monitoring boreholes and is therefore better able to \ncapture the complex evolution of a tracer plume. This is particularly advantageous \nwhen monitoring natural flow, or forced flow in heterogeneous and\/or anisotropic \nformations (Kemna et al., 2002; Sandberg et al., 2002; Cassiani et al., 2006; \nVanderborght et al., 2005). Typically, surface ERT can monitor more extensive \nregions than cross-borehole ERT, but because its resolution decreases markedly with \ndepth it tends to be used only for shallow hydrogeological systems (Cassiani et al., \n2006; Nimmer et al., 2007). The most common approach is to monitor cross-hole \nresistivity data and use 2D inversion algorithms to generate images in the borehole \nplanes (e.g. Daily and Ramirez; 1995; LaBrecque et al., 1996; Slater et al., 1997; \nSandberg et al., 2002; Kemna et al., 2002; Deiana et al., 2007; Looms et al., 2008). \n2D inversion is rapid, permitting monitoring on timescales of tens of minutes to a few \nhours, but provides information only in the plane between the boreholes and is prone \nto artefacts caused by off-plane 3D features (Nimmer et al., 2008). By contrast 3D \ninversion produces volumetric images, fully reconstructing the 3D nature of the tracer \nplume, albeit with decreasing resolution at greater distances from the boreholes. This \nmethod has been used to monitor tracer tests on timescales of several hours to a few \ndays, typically using fewer than 10 boreholes, each with some 10 - 20 electrodes \n(Daily and Ramirez, 2000; Binley et al., 2002; Singha and Gorelick, 2005; \nOldenborger et al., 2007a; Kuras et al., 2009). In many cases, quantitative estimates \ncan be made of seepage velocities (Sandberg et al., 2002), spatial moments (Binley et \nal., 2002; Singha and Gorelick, 2005; Looms et al., 2008), hydraulic conductivity \n(Binley et al., 2002), and tracer mass and concentration (Singha and Gorelick, 2006; \nOldenborger et al., 2007a). \nIn this paper, we present the results of a high spatial and temporal resolution 3D \ntimelapse monitoring study of a saline tracer test. The electrode network comprised 14 \nboreholes, each with 16 electrodes, covering an area of ~40 m2. Tomographic images \nwere obtained every 4 hours from a remotely-controlled automated geoelectrical \nmonitoring system. The test was undertaken at a former gasworks site that had \nrecently undergone remediation, which had been monitored for over a year using a \ncombination of geoelectrical imaging and conventional groundwater sampling to \nvalidate its success. The aim of the tracer test was to determine the direction and \nspeed of the groundwater flow and to demonstrate the ability to monitor natural \nattenuation processes such as dilution and dispersion in near real-time using \nautomated ERT. \nContext \nThe CLARET (Contaminated Land: Assessment of Remediation by Electrical \nTomography) project was undertaken by a public\/private consortium comprising a \nresearch institution, two companies, and a local government authority. The aim of the \nproject was to develop automated 4D geoelectrical imaging as a minimally invasive \ntool to monitor contaminated land and validate remediation processes. Figure 1 \nillustrates the general monitoring concept. Electrodes are installed at a site where a \nreceptor (e.g. a controlled water body) is at risk of contamination. Monitoring of the \ngeoelectrical properties of the site takes place either automatically in near real-time, or \non-demand, with data being transmitted via one of several possible communication \nchannels to the office for automated processing and inversion. This process generates \nvolumetric time-lapse images of the resistivity of the subsurface, which is dependent \non the geology, the groundwater chemistry, and the presence of bulk contaminants \nand their breakdown products (Shevnin et al., 2006). Since the geology is static, \nmonitoring changes in the resistivity images over time highlights temporal variations \nin contamination or groundwater quality associated with remediation. A key \nadvantage of this approach is that the volumetric images can provide information to \nhelp interpolate between point samples and give extra assurance that contamination \nhas not been missed. \nThe CLARET research site was located in Stamford, UK, on the site of a former \ngasworks that has been in use as a municipal car park since 1972 (Fig. 2a). The land, \nknown as the Wharf Road car park, was declared as being statutorily contaminated in \nFebruary 2005 under Part IIA of the UK Environmental Protection Act 1990. Site \ninvestigations found that the highest levels of contamination were in the southern half \nof the site, and were generally associated with former processing and refining areas. \nSeveral significant linkages were identified between the controlled waters of an \nunderlying minor aquifer and a range of pollutants including PAHs (polycyclic \naromatic hydrocarbons), BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) compounds, \npetrol range organics, ammoniacal nitrogen, sulphates and cyanides. \nRemedial works began in April 2007, with the grossly contaminated hotspots being \nexcavated and removed to licensed landfill sites. Other excavated soils were treated \nby ex-situ bioremediation to enable their re-use on site. The excavations were \nvalidated by analysing soil samples taken from the sides and bases to demonstrate that \ncontaminant concentrations were below the target values agreed with the local \ngovernment authority and the Environment Agency. The excavations were infilled \nwith clean processed granular materials obtained from re-grading the car park. \nElectrode network and ALERT system \nThe electrode network was installed after the excavations had been infilled and before \nthe car park surface was reinstated. The network was arranged to cover the south-\neastern corner of the boundaries with the River Welland to the south and privately \nowned land to the east (Figs. 2a & b). Each of the 14 vertical electrode arrays was \ninstalled during a 3-day period in a purpose-drilled borehole and each can be accessed \nvia an inspection cover. The arrays each had 16 electrodes spaced at 0.5 m depth \nintervals, and were connected via purpose-built subsurface conduits to a system \nenclosure just beyond the southern boundary of the site. The installation was \nundertaken in accordance with Environment Agency and Construction (Design & \nManagement) 2007 regulations. The installed system and electrode network had little \nvisual impact on the site (Fig. 2c), and no impact on its use as a car park. \nBefore installation, the noise characteristics were measured of four prototype arrays \ncomprising stainless steel, naval brass, phosphor bronze or lead electrodes. Each array \nwas placed in an existing groundwater monitoring borehole on the site and a set of \ndipole-dipole measurements were made with reciprocals. It was found that the \nphosphor bronze electrodes exhibited the lowest levels of reciprocal error. The \nelectrodes for the permanent arrays were therefore constructed from 5 mm diameter \nphosphor bronze rods, each with an exposed length of 4 cm (Fig. 3a). Each array was \ninstalled in a 100 mm diameter hole drilled using the sonic percussion drilling \nmethod. The electrode array was located inside the drill stem and pushed to depth. A \nplastic lost-point at the end of the drill stem was then released to leave the array in \nposition and allow the stem to be withdrawn over the installed array. Each array was \nmounted onto the outside of eight 1 m bentonite sleeve sections (Fig. 3b). After \ninstallation, swelling of the bentonite sleeves caused the borehole to close, ensuring \ngood electrical contact with the surrounding formation while simultaneously \npreventing the creation of new pollution pathways. A single Pb\/PbCl2 non-polarising \nelectrode was also installed at the top of each of the arrays to monitor self-potential. \nThe resistivity distribution of the subsurface in the vicinity of the electrode network \nwas monitored on a regular and frequent basis during the project by a British \nGeological Survey (BGS) proprietary geoelectrical imaging system. This system, \nknown as ALERT (Automated time-Lapse Electrical Resistivity Tomography), \nenables near real-time autonomous in-situ monitoring of electrical resistivity, induced \npolarisation and self-potential data. It uses wireless telemetry (e.g: GSM\/3G, internet, \nGPRS, or satellite) to communicate with a database management system at the office, \nwhich controls the storage, inversion and delivery of the data and resulting \ntomographic images. Once installed, no manual intervention is required; data is \ntransmitted automatically according to a pre-programmed schedule and specific \nsurvey parameters, both of which may be modified remotely as conditions change. \nThe ALERT instrument is a single unit, contained in a sealed environmental casing \n(Fig. 2c inset). Connection of external sensors to the instrument is made via high \nspecification water-proof connectors mounted on the side of the case. The system is \npowered by 12 or 24 V batteries, with mains, solar or wind turbine charging options. \nIt supports 10-channel simultaneous potential difference measurements, and open-\nended expansion of the number of attached electrodes (in multiples of 32). \nSpecifically, at the test site 238 of a total 288 available electrode addresses were in \nuse (224 resistivity electrodes and 14 self-potential electrodes). The batteries were \ncharged by mains power, and communications were provided via a 3G wireless \ncellular router. \nData acquisition \nTo monitor subsurface changes associated with the site remediation, resistivity data \nwere collected between pairs of adjacent boreholes (\u201cpanels\u201d) as shown in Fig. 4a. \nThe measurement scheme comprised many sets of four-electrode measurements, in \nwhich the current flow and potential measurements are crosshole. In general, these \nprovide better signal-to-noise characteristics and greater image resolution than \nconfigurations with in-hole current flow and potential measurements (Bing and \nGreenhalgh, 2000; Wilkinson et al., 2006; 2008). To provide sufficient image \nresolution in crosshole ERT, it is important that the aspect ratio of the panel (borehole \nspacing \/ depth) is < 0.75 (LaBrecque et al., 1996). In our case, each panel had an \naspect ratio < 0.5.  \nSince the system is capable of multichannel data acquisition, many potential \nmeasurements were made for each pair of current electrodes. The measurement sets \nwere classified into two types: forward and reciprocal. For the forward measurements, \na pair of current electrodes was selected with a vertical offset of s electrode spacings \n(solid lines in Fig. 4a). The first potential difference was measured on the electrodes \nimmediately above the current bipole, followed by successive alternating pairs going \nup the boreholes (dotted lines in Fig. 4a). To cover the whole panel, this geometry \nwas repeated to the top of the boreholes. After this, equivalent reciprocal \nmeasurements were made with the current and potential bipoles interchanged (so that \nthe potential differences are now measured beneath the current electrodes). The \npurpose of making reciprocal measurements is that, in the absence of systematic and \nrandom error, equivalent forward and reciprocal electrode configurations should yield \nthe same resistivity value (Parasnis, 1988; Zhou and Dahlin, 2003). Any difference \nbetween the two gives a reliable indicator of the error in the measurement. \nTo cover the monitoring region, the single panel measurement scheme was repeated \non each of the 31 panels shown by dashed lines in Fig. 4b. During the post-\nremediation monitoring phase of the project, forward and reciprocal data were \nmeasured on each panel for vertical offsets of s = 0, \u00b13, \u00b16, \u00b19, \u00b112. For the rapid \nmonitoring required during the tracer test, only s = 0 was used. Reciprocal data were \nrecorded to assess data quality immediately prior to the test, but during the tracer \nmonitoring only forward measurements were made. The changes were made to reduce \ndata acquisition and battery recharge time from 2 days per data set during remediation \nmonitoring to 4 hours per set during the tracer test. The effect of this reduction in data \ndensity on the resulting inverted images is discussed below. \nData quality \nThe contact resistances of the electrodes were checked to ensure their suitability to \ninject current and measure potential differences. The large majority were in excellent \ncontact with the ground, having contact resistances of 200 - 300 \u2126m. Only four \nelectrodes were making either poor or no contact. These were on array 1 at 1.0 m \ndepth, array 4 at 3.5 m depth, array 5 at 1.5 m depth, and array 8 at 1.5 m depth. No \nmeasurements were made involving these electrodes. \nData quality was assessed in terms of reciprocal error before the tracer test began. The \nmeasured resistivity value \u03c1 was taken to be the mean of the forward measurement \n(\u03c1f) and its reciprocal (\u03c1r), i.e. \u03c1 = (\u03c1f - \u03c1r) \/ 2. Since the standard error of the mean of \nthese two resistivity measurements is |\u03c1f - \u03c1r| \/ 2, the percentage error is given by \n( )rf\nrf100\n\u03c1\u03c1\n\u03c1\u03c1\n+\n\u2212\n, (1) \nwhich is hereafter referred to as the reciprocal error. This was calculated for all s = 0 \nmeasurements to assess the data quality for the whole set. The distribution of \nreciprocal errors is shown in Fig. 5. 98.7% of the data had errors of < 0.3%, and the \nmaximum error recorded was only 2.7%. These errors are extremely low, validating \nthe electrode design, the material choice and installation method of the arrays. \nGround truth and baseline resistivity image \nIntrusive site investigations were undertaken in 2003 and 2006, and borehole cores \nwere recovered in 2007 during the installation of electrode arrays 5, 8 and 9. The \ngeneral lithological sequence observed at the site was made ground, overlying alluvial \nclays, river terrace sand and gravels, and clay bedrock. Before remediation, fissures in \nthe clays provided a pathway for gasworks pollutants in the made ground to seep and \nleach into the river terrace deposits. After remediation, the made ground consisted of \n2 - 3 m of bioremediated infill material. The site investigation logs indicated the \noccurrence of varying amounts of sands and gravel in the alluvial clays, whilst the \narray installation logs suggested that the alluvial deposits and river terrace sands and \ngravels are interbedded. At depths of ~5 m, the logs indicated a continuous deposit of \nsands and gravels, forming a minor aquifer of 0.5 - 1 m thickness. Underlying this are \nfurther layers of alluvium and river terrace deposits and clay bedrock, identified as \nWhitby Mudstone in the installation logs. The aquifer was assumed to be semi-\nconfined by this underlying alluvium and bedrock. \nA subsurface resistivity image obtained in September 2008 during post-remediation \nmonitoring is shown in Figs. 6a & b. The data were inverted with the Res3DInv \nsoftware using a finite difference method, the incomplete Gauss-Newton solver, an L1 \ndata constraint, and an L2 model constraint weighted to emphasize horizontally \nlayered structures. The data were subdivided into two overlapping rectangular blocks \nof panels for inversion, a southern block bounded by arrays 3, 4, 8 and 14 (see \nFig. 4b) and an eastern block bounded by arrays 1, 4, 5 and 9. These blocks were \ndiscretised into cubic model cells of side length 0.25 m. Fig. 6a shows a vertical slice \nthrough the southern block model along the line y = 2.375 m. Similarly, Fig. 6b shows \na vertical slice through the eastern block model along x = 10.375 m. Convergence was \nreached after 10 iterations, with mean absolute misfit errors of 3.1% and 2.8% \nrespectively. In the images, the electrodes are shown as white rectangles, and a \nlithological log from array 8 is shown to the right of Fig. 6b at the same depth scale.  \nThe images exhibit alternating resistive and conductive horizontal layers that correlate \nwell with the lithology above the base of the aquifer. The top 3 m of bioremediated, \ninfilled ground are predominantly resistive, since they are less well compacted than \nthe undisturbed ground beneath and therefore better drained. The Flandrian river \nalluvium, at depths of ~ 3 - 5 m below ground level (bgl), has high clay content and \nhence is very conductive (although resistivities of <3 \u2126m are unusually low for clay, \nsee below). Beneath this, at depths of ~ 5 - 6 m bgl, is the minor aquifer consisting \npredominantly of sands and gravel. Electrical conduction in this layer is dominated by \nthe groundwater, which is more resistive than the clay-rich alluvium. Beneath this, the \ncorrelation with the borehole logs is not as clear. The logs indicate further sands and \ngravels, above a layer of Whitby mudstone at depths of over 7 m bgl. The images \nindicate thin alternating resistive and conductive layers, possibly underlain by \nconductive bedrock at ~8 m bgl. Two of these three resistive layers do not appear to \nbe continuous, although their disappearance with increasing distance from the \nborehole electrodes is probably due to the associated decrease in image resolution \nwith increasing distance (Kemna et al., 2002, Oldenborger et al., 2007b). It is possible \nthat the lack of quantitative agreement between the logs and the images below 6 m bgl \nis due to slippage in the core barrel. This occurs when material in the core barrel shifts \ninto void space produced by wash-out during sonic drilling, and it has been observed \npreviously when using this method (Wilkinson et al., 2008). This type of drilling also \ncompacts the ground in the vicinity of the borehole (Wilkinson et al., 2008), which \nmay account for the strong borehole effects (the anomalous increases in resistivity \nthat surround the borehole arrays). The raised resistivities near the boreholes may also \naccount for lower-than-expected modelled resistivities for the surrounding alluvium, \nsince resistivity contrasts near electrodes can cause \u201cshadow\u201d under- or over-shoots in \nadjacent regions (Dahlin and Zhou, 2004).  \nThe piezometric level across the monitoring region was ~2.2 m bgl. The levels were \nmeasured prior to the tracer test to assess the likely groundwater flow velocity and \npossibility of being able to monitor the test using crosshole ERT. The levels were \nmeasured in three groundwater monitoring wells (GMW3-5, Fig. 2b), which were \nscreened only at depths of 4.3 - 5.5 m (GWM3), 5.0 - 6.0 m (GMW4) and 4.8 - 5.8 m \n(GMW5) to allow water to be drawn from the minor aquifer. Table 1 shows the \npiezometric levels below datum (ground level at GMW3). The surface topography \nwas measured by theodolite and the depths to water by measuring tape. \n \nTable 1 \nPiezometric levels \n GMW3 GMW4 GMW5 \nDepth to water (m \nbelow surface) \n2.20 \u00b1 0.01 2.17 \u00b1 0.01 2.23 \u00b1 0.01 \nSurface topography \n(m below datum) \n0 0.036 \u00b1 0.001 0.054 \u00b1 0.001 \nPiezometric level \n(m below datum) \n2.20 \u00b1 0.01 2.21 \u00b1 0.01 2.28 \u00b1 0.01 \n \nThe seepage velocity, v, is given in terms of the hydraulic conductivity, K, the \neffective porosity of the medium, n, and the head gradient, I, by  \nn\nKI\nv = . (2) \nCoarse sands typically have hydraulic conductivities in the range 9\u00d710-7 m\/s < K < \n6\u00d710-3 m\/s, gravels have 3\u00d710-4 m\/s < K < 3\u00d710-2 m\/s, and typical porosities are \nn ~ 0.3 (Domenico and Schwartz, 1998). For the sand and gravel minor aquifer, it is \nreasonable to take the lower bound for gravel of K = 3\u00d710-4 m\/s, which overlaps with \nthe range for sand, to obtain an estimated seepage velocity of v ~ 0.5 m\/day between \nGMW4 and GMW5 (a distance of 14.0 m approximately in the \u2013x direction). By \ncomparison the estimated velocity between GMW3 and GMW4, approximately in the \n\u2013y direction, is negligible (~0.04 m\/day). \nWhen monitoring dynamic processes using geoelectrical imaging there is an implicit \nassumption that the data are collected simultaneously. This assumption is reasonable \nif the characteristic time scales of the processes being monitored are significantly \nlonger than the time required to collect the data. But if the processes are more rapid, \nso that significant changes can occur during data collection, then the resulting image \ncan exhibit blurring and poor convergence with the measured data. The piezometric \nlevels suggested that a tracer injected into the aquifer via GMW4 should flow almost \ndirectly towards GMW5, i.e. roughly antiparallel to the x-axis. Since the seepage \nvelocity in this direction would be ~ 0.5 m\/day, the tracer would advance by ~ 2 \nmodel cells\/day. To avoid temporal blurring a shorter monitoring period was required \nthan was used in the post-remediation monitoring (\u03c4 = 2 days). To reduce the period, \nonly offsets of s = 0 were used and reciprocal measurements were not made, giving a \ntotal of 4,689 apparent resistivity data for each image and reducing the measurement \ntime to 1.7 hours. During this time, the tracer would have been expected to move by \n< 0.15 model cells, significantly reducing any time-lapse blurring.  \nThe total monitoring period was \u03c4 = 4 hours, which allowed time for the batteries to \nrecharge and data to be inverted (the southern and eastern blocks took 25 and 18 \nminutes to invert respectively on a 2.4 GHz dual core processor). The effects of \nreducing the data density can be seen in Figs. 6c and d, which show the baseline \nresistivity model for the tracer test that was obtained in October 2008, 18 hours prior \nto injection. The inversions converged after 7 iterations with mean absolute misfit \nerrors of 1.9% for the both the southern and eastern blocks. There is a reduction in \ncontrast in the baseline image in comparison with Figs. 6a and b, and the lack of non-\nzero vertical offsets appears to have reduced the lateral resolution. However, the \nlayered structure of the image is still evident, and most of the lateral structure can still \nbe discerned, suggesting that it should be possible to track the lateral position of the \ntracer front. \nTracer test & discussion \nA strong saline tracer (1000 litres, at a concentration of 40 g\/l) was released into the \naquifer via GMW4 to investigate the local groundwater flow velocity and to \ndemonstrate rapid ERT monitoring of natural attenuation processes. A high \nconcentration was used to give a good resistivity contrast. Density driven flow was \nassumed to be insignificant due to the underlying aquiclude. This investigation was \nbeyond the original scope of the project, so there were no resources for repeated \ngroundwater monitoring on the timescales required by the expected speed of the \ntracer, and no logger was available that could be installed in the groundwater \nmonitoring wells. Instead, an extra set of resistivity data was taken during each 4-hour \nperiod. These comprised unit spaced Wenner apparent resistivity measurements taken \non each individual electrode array. These were centred vertically on the aquifer and \nused the electrodes shown as white circles in Figs. 6c and d. Since these data were not \nused in the inversion, they could be used to plot independent breakthrough curves, the \nresistivity of which would decrease \/ increase as the local salinity of the aquifer \nincreased \/ decreased (although the dependence would not be directly proportional, \nsince the sensitivity distribution of the Wenner distribution extends beyond its upper \nand lower electrodes). \nAn environmental risk assessment was carried out to obtain permission to undertake \nthe test from the Environment Agency and the local government authority. This \nindicated that the tracer should be injected at a moderate rate to minimise the risk of \nmobilising residual contamination by flushing. Therefore the tracer was released at a \nsteady rate of ~ 4 l\/min, taking just over 4 hours to release 1000 l into the aquifer. \nResistivity data were collected continuously from the time of the initial release. The \nWenner apparent resistivity breakthrough curves are shown in Fig. 7. The curves are \nshown at distances in the x direction of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10.5 m (arrays 4, 5, 6, 7, and \n14 respectively). The curve for array 2 (5 m separation in the y direction) is also \nshown. For arrays 5, 6 and 14, there are small anomalous features in the breakthrough \ncurves at t ~ 24 days after injection (indicated by small vertical arrows in Fig. 7). The \nsource of these is not known \n, although they occur more strongly in other breakthrough curves that were not used \n(e.g. for array 8, the resistivity increase due to this feature has the same magnitude as \nthe decrease due to the saline front and takes several days to decay, obscuring the \nresistivity minimum). Assuming the arrival time is shown by the arrowed resistivity \nminima, the mean tracer velocity is v = 0.45 \u00b1 0.06 m\/day (see Table 2), which is in \ngood agreement with the value estimated from the piezometric levels. \n \nTable 2 \nBreakthrough curve tracer speeds \nDistance from GMW4 (m) Apparent resistivity minimum (days) Speed (m\/day) \n3.24 5.5 0.59 \n5.55 17.5 0.32 \n7.95 18 0.44 \n11.34 25.5 0.44 \n \nThe spatial distribution of the saline tracer can be seen clearly in the results of the \nERT monitoring, which are shown in Fig. 8. Inverse models were generated from the \nmonitoring data every four hours although, for the sake of conciseness, only \nrepresentative images are displayed. While not obvious from this limited number of \nimages, it is worth stressing that the evolution of the conductive region is smooth and \ncontinuous at the four-hour timescale. Each image shown in Fig. 8 was generated \nfrom the data set taken between 18:00 and 20:00 hours on the indicated day. For day \n0, this was 2 hours after the end of the tracer release. Due to the low levels of noise, \nthe inversions were performed without time-lapse constraints and directly on separate \ndata sets, rather than on differences between subsequent sets. In these circumstances, \nuse of the background image as a starting model is not necessary (Miller et al., 2008). \nThe mean absolute misfit errors for the models are all in the range 1.8% - 1.9%. The \nimages are displayed normalised to the baseline model shown in Fig. 6c, since this \nreduces the strong borehole effects that are clearly visible in the baseline model \n(Slater et al., 2000; Descloitres et al., 2008). Due to the normalisation, regions that \nhave become more conductive are shown as resistivity ratios < 1. Only the southern \nblock is displayed, since along the eastern block the tracer migration is observed to \nstop at y = 3.5 m. The upper (horizontal) slices are at a depth of 5.375 m bgl, the \nlower (vertical) slices are at y = 1.375 m.  \nThe ERT images show the appearance and evolution of a conductive region between \ndepths of ~ 5 - 6 m bgl. The extent and intensity of this conductive region can be seen \nto vary considerably on the scale of several days. Only small changes in resistivity \noccurred at these depths over timescales of several months during post-remediation \nmonitoring. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that any increases in conductivity are \ncaused by increases in salinity due to the presence of the tracer. Therefore the changes \nin the images allow the distribution and density of the tracer to be visualised directly \nin 4D. They indicate that the tracer is predominantly localised in a horizontal aquifer \nthat is reasonably uniform and approximately 1 m thick throughout the model space. \nThe absence of conductivity increases above 5 m bgl implies that there is little \nupwards migration of the tracer through fissures in the clay, and that the aquifer is \nreasonably well confined. There is some evidence that at t = 0 a fraction of the tracer \nescaped from the injection borehole, suggesting that either the base or the sides of \nGMW4 are not perfectly sealed. By contrast, there appear to be no losses from the \nelectrode array boreholes, which gives confidence that no pollution pathways were \ncreated during the array installations.  \nThe changes in the extent of the conductive region suggest that the majority of the \ntracer was carried along the piezometric gradient in the \u2013x direction. The tracer speed \ncan be estimated from the models by finding the time of minimum resistivity at the \npoints marked by light blue crosses in Fig. 8. The resistivities were calculated as the \naverage of all model cells immediately adjacent to each cross. Using this method the \nmean tracer speed was found to be v = 0.49 \u00b1 0.07 m\/day (see Table 3), in good \nagreement with the estimate derived from the Wenner breakthrough curves. There is \nalso evidence that there may be some tracer movement along the y axis. Initially \nmotion in this direction seems to have been dominated by dispersion. But comparison \nof the horizontal slices in Figs. 8d, e and f suggests that the tracer has since begun to \nmove towards \u2013y, indicating a small seepage velocity component in this direction.  \n \nTable 3 \nModel resistivity tracer speeds \nDistance from GMW4 (m) Model resistivity minimum (days) Speed (m\/day) \n3.37 5 0.67 \n5.64 16 0.35 \n8.09 19 0.43 \n11.20 23 0.49 \n \nIn addition to the large resistivity decreases observed in the aquifer layer, there are \nlocalised increases in resistivity of much lower magnitude in the made ground at \ndepths of ~ 1 - 2 m. Similar changes in the made ground resistivity were observed \nduring post-remediation monitoring, and were found to be strongly anticorrelated with \nthe average air temperature over the previous 7 days. A tentative explanation for this \neffect is that increases in pore water resistivity in the made ground are caused by \ndecreases in the received solar radiation, since the black tarmac surface above the \nmade ground has a low albedo (Thompson, 1998). \nConclusions \nThe CLARET project has provided useful experience for the geoelectrical monitoring \nof contaminated land and remediation processes. It has shown that an electrode \nnetwork can be installed in parallel with remedial works and in accordance with site \nand environmental regulations. The installation method was demonstrated to produce \ngood electrical contact with the ground and excellent data quality. The ERT images \ngenerated from the data were generally in good agreement with the site lithology \nderived from core logging, providing useful complementary information where there \nwas inconsistency in the recovered depths to interfaces. \nThe capabilities of geoelectrical monitoring were demonstrated by a saline tracer test. \nUsing measurement sequences designed for rapid data acquisition, the volumetric \nimages permitted the evolution of the tracer to be visualised directly throughout the \nentire monitoring volume in near real-time. Apparent resistivity breakthrough curves \nwere measured independently of the imaging data on each electrode array. \nQuantitative estimates of seepage velocity derived from the images and the \nbreakthrough curves were found to be in good agreement, and also agreed with \nestimates based on measured piezometric gradients and assumed hydrogeological \nparameters. \nThe tracer test has demonstrated that contaminants affecting the electrical resistivity \nof the subsurface can be tracked and monitored at field-scale in near real-time, on \ntime scales of hours upwards. By enabling the direct observation of dispersion and \ndilution processes, this test has shown that geoelectrical monitoring of remediation is \ndirectly applicable to sites where remediation is being undertaken by monitored \nnatural attenuation. However, there is no reason why the concept should not be \nequally applicable to most other in-situ remediation techniques operating on similar \ntime-scales. In combination with calibration from intrusive sampling and resistivity-\nconcentration relations that can be corrected for variable image resolution (Singha and \nGorelick, 2006), time-lapse ERT has the potential to provide direct quantitative \nvolumetric imaging of remediation processes. \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper is published with the permission of the Executive Director of the British \nGeological Survey (NERC).
