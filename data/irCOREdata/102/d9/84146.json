Subsequent growth of the myocardium is achieved through an\nincrease in myocyte cell size, known as hypertrophy. Following\nmyocardial injury, cardiac myocytes are lost from the damaged area\nand replaced by scar tissue. Any loss in cardiac function is\ncompensated by a physiological hypertrophic response and cardiac\nremodeling. Although this process initially helps to maintain cardiac\noutput, the remodeling process continues and eventually leads to the\ndevelopment of pathological hypertrophy and heart failure [5\u20137].\nThe change in growth potential of cardiac myocytes during cardiac\ndevelopment and hypertrophy is reflected in the expressions and\nactivities of certain cell cycle molecules.[8\u201315] Thus, positive\nregulators of the cell cycle machinery, such as the Cdk\/cyclin\ncomplexes and the pro-proliferative E2F transcription factors (E2F1-3)\nare down regulated, whilst negative regulators, including retinoblas-\ntoma protein (pRb) and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors\n(CDKIs), p21 and p27, are upregulated. As a consequence, the\nmajority of adult mammalian cardiac myocytes are arrested inG0\/G1,\nwith the remaining cells being present at the G2\/M transition[15].\nCurrent strategies aimed at encouraging repair of the heart\nfocus on the use of stem cells or gene therapy to induce cell\ndivision and differentiation at the site of damage to reduce the size\nof the infarct and improve patient outcome.[16,17] In support of\nthe gene therapy approach, work from our laboratory[12,13,18]\nand others (see below) have shown that manipulation of the\ncardiac myocyte cell cycle machinery could be a suitable\ntherapeutic approach for promoting myocardial repair. Alterations\nin the expressions of certain cell cycle molecules can increase\ncardiac myocyte proliferation in vitro,[18\u201325] inhibit the induction\nof hypertrophy in vitro[12] or increase cardiac myocyte num-\nber[14,24] and promote myocardial repair[25,26] in vivo. These\nstudies have highlighted a number of potential targets for the\nreinitiation of cardiac myocyte cell division, with the aim of\nincreasing the number of cardiac myocytes and reducing infarct\nsize to improve patient outcome.\nThe Polo-like kinases (Plks) are a family of serine\/threonine\nkinases that exhibit sequence identity in both their N-terminal\ncatalytic domain and their C-terminal region, which is termed the\npolo-box domain (PBD). This C-terminal region contains phospho-\npeptide binding motifs[27,28], called \u2018polo-boxes\u2019, that are essential\nfor Plk localization and regulation.[29\u201332] This family of kinases\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 8 | e6752\nincludes the mammalian Plks: Plk1, Plk2 (Snk), Plk3 (Fnk\/Prk) and\nPlk4 (Sak-a\/b); Xenopus laevis Plx1,[33] Schizosaccharomyces pombe\nplo1+ and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC5 [34\u201336].\nPlk1 is important for mitotic progression (karyokinesis and\ncytokinesis); it is involved in the nuclear translocation of cyclin\nB1,[37] microtubule dynamics,[38\u201342] activation of Cdc25C,[42]\ninactivation of Wee1[43,44] and Myt1,[45] separation of chro-\nmosomes at anaphase and destruction of mitotic proteins through\nactivation of the anaphase promoting complex\/cyclosome (APC\/\nC).[46,47] Recently, it has been demonstrated that Plk1\ncontributes to cytokinesis in human cells[48,49] and that inhibition\nof Plk1 activity with the highly selective inhibitor, BI\n2536,[48,50,51] results in cytokinesis failure and the generation\nof binucleated cells. Plk2\u20134 display varying roles in cell cycle\nprogression: Plk2 plays a role in centriole duplication;[52] Plk3 is a\nnon-cycling Plk[53] involved in G2 checkpoint signaling.[54] Plk4\ndiffers from Plk1\u20133 as it contains a variation of the Plk kinase motif\nand has a single polo-box.[55] Plk4 has been shown to localize to\ncentrioles and, like Plk2, is thought to be important for centriole\nduplication. Loss or over expression of Plk4 results in defects in the\ncentriole cycle and aberrant spindle formation [56\u201359].\nPreviously, Plk1 mRNA and protein have been shown to decline\nduring rat cardiac myocyte development.[60] We have extended\nthese studies and characterized the expression of the whole family of\nmammalian Plks during rat cardiac myocyte development. We\nconfirmed that the expression and activity of Plk1 in cardiac\nmyocytes declines during development in accordance with observa-\ntions previously reported.[60] Plk2, Plk3 and Plk4 also showed small,\nbut significant, changes at the mRNA and protein levels during\ndevelopment. In addition, we have tested the hypothesis that over\nexpression of Plk1 would reinitiate the cell cycle in G2\/M-arrested\ncells and increase the number of cardiac myocytes. Adenovirus\nconstructs were generated to express wild-type Plk1 or a constitu-\ntively active Plk1 with the phospho-mimicking T210D mutation.\nDespite being able to increase HeLa cell proliferation, we found that\nover expression of Plk1 was unable to induce cell cycle progression in\nisolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes at 48 hours, or in adult rat\ncardiac myocytes at 24 hours. We found that this most likely due to\nthe inability of Plk1 to increase the activity of Cdc2\/cyclin B1. Based\non these findings, we sought to further characterize the G2\/M arrest\noriginally observed in adult cardiac myocytes with the aim of\ndetermining a more precise description of the G2\/M arrest. Using\nan immunohistochemical approach, we found no evidence of G2\/M\nmarker expression in the adult myocardium and conclude that this\nmay be indicative of an earlier arrest.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement\nVentricular cardiac myocytes were isolated from wild type\nWistar rats which were housed and maintained in a colony in\naccordance with the Local Ethical Review Panel of the University\nof Reading and U.K. Home Office guidelines.

For adult\ncardiomyocyte infection studies, isolated adult myocytes were\nplated in serum-free modified M199 medium (M199 containing\n2 mM creatine, 5 mM taurine and 2 mM carnitine) for 1 hr on\nMatrigelTM-coated six-well dishes. Adherent adult cardiomyocytes\nwere washed and then infected at a MOI (multiplicity of infection)\nof 50 plaque forming units of each virus per cell in modified M199\nmedium. Infected cultures were maintained in modified M199\nmedium for 24 h before analysis. Neonatal cells were transfected\n24 hours after isolation. Cells were washed with PBS and infected\nin either serum-free M199 media or M199 supplemented with 5%\nFCS. Cells were incubated for 48 hours prior to analysis.\nWestern Blotting\nProtein expression levels were determined by SDS-PAGE\nanalysis as previously described [10,13].\nIn vitro kinase assays\nCdc2\/cyclin B1 immunocomplexes were immunoprecipitated\nfrom 250 mg of protein extracted from infected cultures using anti-\ncyclin B1 antibody and kinase activity measured as described\npreviously [18]. For Plk1 kinase assays, protein lysate was prepared\nfrom infected cell cultures in TBSN lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES\npH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 25 mM b-glycerophos-\nphate, 25 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM p-nitro phenyl-\nphosphate (pNPP), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 72 mg\/ml AEBSF, 10 mg\/\nml leupeptin, 5 mg\/ml aprotinin). Samples were precleared with\n30 ml Protein-G Agarose beads at 0.1 g\/ml (Sigma) at 4uC on a\nrotating wheel for 1 hour. Plk1 was immunoprecipitated with\n1.5 ml monoclonal mouse anti-Plk1 antibody cocktail (Zymed) and\npulled down with 30 ml Protein G-Agarose. Immunoprecipitated\nPlk1 was washed twice in TBSN buffer and twice in TDSN\n(50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),\n2 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM sodium vanadate, 20 mM p-nitrophenyl\nphosphate) and incubated with 4 mg casein, 10 mCi AT32P and\n10 mM ATP in 25 ml TDSN buffer at 30uC for 30 minutes. The\nreaction was terminated by boiling the samples in 1X Laemmli\nbuffer with 0.2 M dithiothreitol (DTT) for 5 minutes. Samples\nwere loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto\nnitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were assessed with a\nphosphorimager cassette (Molecular Dynamics) for the desired\ntime.\nImmunocytochemistry\nNeonatal cardiomyocytes were cultured in 5% myocyte media\non gelatin-coated glass coverslips for 24 h before infection with\nrecombinant adenoviruses. Adult cardiomyocytes were plated on\nto MatrigelTM-coated chamber slides for 1 hr before infection with\nrecombinant adenoviruses. Cell monolayers were fixed in 1% (v\/v)\nformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (21uC),\npermeabilised with 0.5% (v\/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min\nand blocked in 10% (v\/v) normal goat serum\/2% (w\/v) BSA in\nPBS for 30 min. Cardiac myocytes were identified by staining with\ncardiac myocyte markers: anti-tropomyosin (sarcomeric) mono-\nclonal antibody (clone CH1) was detected with anti-mouse IgG\nAlexaFluorH 568 or anti-troponin I was detected with anti-rabbit\nIgG AlexaFluorH 488 conjugate. These markers were used to\ndistinguish cardiomyocytes from non-myocytes. Images were\ncollected using an Axioskop2 microscope in conjunction with\nAxioVision software (Zeiss).\nStatistical analysis\nAll results are presented as means6standard error of the mean\n(SEM). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by the\nappropriate t-test, with P,0.05 considered to be statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nExpression and activity of Plk1 declines during rat cardiac\nmyocyte development\nBased upon previous studies showing the downregulation of\npositive regulators of cell cycle molecules during cardiac myocyte\ndevelopment, we hypothesized that the expression of Plk1 would\nbe downregulated as these cells progressed towards full differen-\ntiation. Quantitative PCR analysis revealed a progressive decline\nin Plk1 mRNA levels during development (Figure 1A) and this was\nalso seen at the protein level (Figure 1B). No Plk1 protein was\ndetected in adult cardiac myocytes. Interestingly, the activity of\nPlk1 does not change significantly at P10, compared to P3 levels,\ndespite a decline in Plk1 expression (Figure 1B\u2013E). These results\nsuggest that there is a change in the regulation of Plk1 leading to\nincreased activity at P10 compared to levels in P3 cardiac\nmyocytes that is independent of protein synthesis.\nmRNA and protein levels of Plk2, Plk3 and Plk4 during rat\ncardiac myocyte development\nQuantitative PCR revealed differential patterns of regulation for\nPlk2, Plk3 and Plk4 mRNA during the postnatal developmental\nperiod; all are significantly downregulated in the adult. Plk2\nshowed very little change from E18 levels throughout postnatal\ndevelopment (Figure 2A) whereas Plk3 showed a small, but\nsignificant, increase in mRNA levels during the early postnatal\ngrowth phase (P2 and P5) (Figure 2B). Plk4 showed a small,\nsignificant decrease at P2 and is downregulated by ,90% in the\nadult compared to E18 levels (Figure 2C). At the protein level,\nPlk2, Plk3 and Plk4 are all expressed in the adult (Figures 3A to F),\nunlike Plk1, which is not be detected in adult cardiac myocytes\n(Figure 1B). Plk2 protein levels showed a considerable degree of\nvariability between samples (n = 5); protein levels do not appear to\nchange significantly during development. Plk3 protein expression\nalso remains unchanged during early postnatal development, but\ndoes appear to be downregulated in the adult heart by ,40%\ncompared to embryonic day 18 (E18). Plk4 protein levels decrease\nas development proceeds, with a significant downregulation at P2\nand in the adult (Figure 3E and F).\nBased upon the data showed here, Plk1 is the most interesting\ncandidate for re-initiation of cell cycle in adult cardiac myocytes. No\nprotein expression or activity is detectable in the adult heart, whereas\nPlk2\u20134 are all expressed, albeit at lower levels, compared to E18.\nAdenoviral expression of active Plk1 in both HeLa cells\nand cardiac myocytes\nPetronczki et al (2007)[48] have shown that inhibition of Plk1 in\nHeLa cells released from a metaphase block results in binuclea-\ntion. The majority of adult cardiac myocytes are binucleated and\ndo not express Plk1. We hypothesized that reintroduction of Plk1\ninto isolated adult rat cardiac myocytes might drive the cells\nthrough a successful round of nuclear and\/or cell division, thereby\nincreasing cell number. Accordingly, we generated adenoviruses\ncarrying Plk1 in conjunction with an internal ribosomal entry site\n(IRES) and EGFP marker. To confirm the ability of the Plk1\nconstruct to induce cell cycle progression in proliferating cells,\nHeLa cells were infected with adenovirus containing either EGFP,\nPlk1 & Myocardial Regeneration\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 August 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 8 | e6752\nwild-type or constitutively active (T210D) Plk1 at a multiplicity of\ninfection (MOI) of 50 (50 virus particles per cell). Forty eight hours\npost infection, we found that over-expression of wild-type (WT)\nPlk1 increased the number of HeLa cells by 2365.6% (n= 3,\np = 0.02), compared to the EGFP control (Figure 4A and B).\nConstitutively active Plk1 (T210D) also increased HeLa cell\nnumbers by 2061.5% above the EGFP control. This data shows\nthat adenovirus-delivered Plk1 was able to induce cell division in\nproliferative cells. We then assessed the activity of adenovirus-\ndelivered Plk1 by in vitro kinase assay in non-proliferating P10\ncardiac myocytes: Plk1 kinase activity was increased in both WT\nand T210D Plk1 expressing cells (Figure 4C).\nOver-expression of catalytically active Plk1 has no effect\non cardiac myocyte binucleation\nWe next determined the effect of over expressing catalytically\nactive WT and T210D Plk1 on cardiac myocyte cell binucleation.\nVentricular cardiac myocytes were isolated from P3, P7 and adult\nWistar rat hearts and subjected to adenovirus infection as above;\nP7 cardiac myocytes were chosen due to their improved viability\nfollowing isolation compared to P10 cells (data not shown). The\neffect of EGFP, WT or constitutively active (T210D) Plk1\nexpression on cardiac myocyte binucleation was assessed by\ncalculating the number of nuclei per cardiac myocyte. For\nuninfected postnatal cells, the number of binucleated cells\nincreased from ,20% at P3 to ,40% at P7. Adult cardiac\nmyocytes showed extensive (,90%) binucleation (Figure 5A).\nSurprisingly, we found adenovirus-delivered Plk1 did not have a\nsignificant effect on the percentage of binucleated cardiac\nmyocytes at any stage of development (Figures 5B, C and D).\nThis was somewhat surprising, especially at P3 where there is still a\ncapacity for cell division. To determine whether there had been an\neffect on cell number but not on binucleation, we performed cell\ncounts at P3 and found that there was no significant increase in\nFigure 1.

Cell\ncounts were performed on permeabilised, fixed samples stained\nwith cardiac specific markers so rule out increases in cell number\nby contaminating cardiac fibroblast cells.\nOver-expression of Plk1 does not increase the activity of\nCdc2\/cyclin B1 in P3 cardiac myocytes\nWhilst over-expression of Plk1 had no effect on binucleation in\nadult cardiac myocytes, it was surprising that Plk1 had no effect on\nP3 cardiac myocytes at all. P3 cardiac myocytes express the mitotic\nregulator Cdc2\/cyclin B1[18] and retain a limited proliferative\ncapacity. Plk1 promotes activation of Cdc2\/cyclin B1[37,42] and\ninhibits the activity of the Cdc2\/cyclin B1 inhibitors, Wee1 and\nMyt1[43,45,61]. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of Plk1 over\nexpression on Cdc2\/cyclin B1 activity in P3 rat cardiac myocytes\nto determine whether this might explain the lack of cell cycle\nprogression. Interestingly, the activity of Plk1 increased in cells\ninfected with both wild-type and constitutively active Plk1\nadenovirus, whereas the activity of Cdc2\/cyclin B1 in these cells\nwas unaffected (Figure 6). This data shows that the activation of\nCdc2\/cyclin B in differentiating rat cardiac myocytes cannot be\nachieved solely by the over expression of Plk1 and highlights the\ncomplexity of cell cycle regulation in cardiac myocytes. This work\nshows that careful consideration is required when choosing which\nmolecules should be selected for these studies. It is clear that the\ncell cycle must be manipulated in precisely the right way in order\nto elicit cell cycle progression.\nCardiac myocytes do not express G2\/M markers\nThe current study aimed to determine whether Plk1 could be a\npotential therapeutic target for the initiation of cardiac repair in\nthe mammalian heart. This hypothesis was based on previous\nstudies that have shown that a significant population of adult\ncardiac myocytes is G2\/M arrested [14,15,62,63]], and that over\nexpression of the G2\/M regulator Cdc2\/cyclin B1 is sufficient to\nFigure 2.

Although the data presented here\nshows that Plk1 is unable to do this, it does highlight that a more\ndefinitive understanding of the arrest in cardiac myocytes is\nnecessary in order to successfully identify potential targets for a\ngene therapy approach. In order to further characterise the arrest\nin cardiac myocytes, and a therefore provide a smaller number of\npotential targets, we decided to more precisely define the point\nwithin the G2\/M arrest that these cells are arrested in. Four\nmicrometre sections were taken from E18, P3, P10 and adult\nWistar rat hearts (Figure 6) and assessed for the expression of Ki67\nand phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (Ser10) and at\nserine 28 (Ser28).\nThe proliferation marker, Ki67, is present in all phases of the\ncell cycle, increasing from G1 to maximal intensity at the\nmetaphase-anaphase transition, but is not found in telophase nor\nin quiescent, G0, cells[64]. Histone H3 becomes phosphorylated\non Ser10 during late G2 and is important for chromosome\ncondensation[65\u201367]. Ser28 is also phosphorylated during mitosis,\nand like Ser10 phosphorylation, contributes to chromosome\ncondensation [68]. However, unlike Ser10, Ser28 is not phos-\nphorylated until the onset of mitosis[68] and therefore serves as a\nmore faithful mitotic marker.\nThe expression of Ki67 and the phosphorylation of histone H3\nat Ser10 and Ser28 declined with age (Figure 7). Very few (Ki67,\n0.4960.25%; Ser10, 0.3560.27%; Ser28, 0.2960.15%; n= 3,\nmean6SEM) troponin-I-positive adult cardiac myocytes demon-\nstrated any staining or mitotic figures. Previous studies have\ninvestigated the isolated nuclei of adult cardiac myocytes using\nFACS analysis using dual staining for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)\nand propidium iodide (PI) [14,15]. This type of analysis\ndetermines cell cycle stage by assessing the DNA content of each\nevent (cell or nucleus) as it passes through the laser. Any event\ndisplaying a double DNA content, such as a post-S phase, mitotic\nor binucleated cell, will be classified as a G2\/M cell. The lack of\nany Ser10 or Ser28 staining or mitotic structures suggests that the\nG2\/M population originally observed in adult rat cardiac\nmyocytes most likely represents a population of late S-phase\/\nearly G2-arrested cells, rather cells in late G2\/M. This might\nexplain why Plk1 is unable to induce cell cycle progression while\nCdc2\/cyclin B1 can; Cdc2\/cyclin B1 reaches its peak activity\nbefore the G2\/M transition while Plk1 peaks at metaphase[69].\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we have determined the expression of the\nmammalian Plk family of serine\/threonine protein kinases in the\ndeveloping rat cardiac myocyte in an effort to better understand\nwhy adult cardiac myocytes are unable to proliferate and repair\nthe damaged myocardium, and to potentially identify novel\ntherapeutic targets that could be manipulated to encourage\nmyocardial repair.\nDeveloping cardiac myocytes undergo binucleation during\nneonatal growth,[70\u201373] whilst adult cells undergo a G1\/S transition\nduring the process of hypertrophy.[2,74]. Both Plk2 and Plk4 are\nFigure 4. Effect of adenovirus-delivered Plk1 on HeLa cell number and Plk1 activity. Plk1 enhanced cell division in HeLa cells at 48 hours\npost infection (A and B).

Ventricular cardiac myocytes were isolated and\ninfected with EGFP, WT or T210D adenovirus and incubated for 48 hours (P3 and P7) or 24 hours (adult) in serum free media or media supplemented\nwith 5% foetal calf serum (FCS).

Adult cardiac myocytes are thought to be blocked\nin G2\/M and it is possible that Plk3 could contribute to the\narrested state of these cells.\nThe decline in Plk1 mRNA and protein levels and activity\nobserved during cardiac myocyte development is consistent with\nprevious studies from our laboratory, and others, examining the\nexpression of other such positive regulators of the cell cy-\ncle[8,11,12,18,21,23\u201325] and extends the work by Georgescu et\nal [60]. To investigate the role of Plk1 in nuclear and cellular\ndivision in rat cardiac myocytes, we over expressed wild type and\nconstitutively active Plk1 in adult myocytes for 48 hours in the\nabsence or presence of serum to determine whether Plk1 activity\ncould induce cell division. Neither the wild type nor the\nconstitutively active mutant induced any changes in cell cycle\nprogression, in terms of the percentage of binucleated cells, or cell\nnumber. Surprisingly, we also found that catalytically active Plk1\nwas unable to increase the activity of endogenous Cdc2\/cyclin B1\nin P3 cardiac myocytes, suggesting that Plk1 is unable to complete\nwith the other factors that regulate activity of the Cdc2\/cyclin B1\ncomplex. As well as dephosphorylation of Cdc2 at Thr14 and\nTyr15 by Cdc25C, phosphorylation of Thr161 in the catalytic T-\nloop by Cdk activating kinase (CAK) is essential for Cdc2\/cyclin\nB1 activity.[79] It is likely that some of these other factors limit the\nactivation of endogenous Cdc2\/cyclin B1; for example, CAK\nphosphorylates Cdc2 at Thr161 [80] and this modification is\nrequired for full activation of the Cdc2\/cyclin B1 complex. If Plk1\ncan only enhance the activity of Cdc2\/cyclin B1 that already is\nphosphorylated at Thr161, the amount of active Plk1 present\nwould be irrelevant if CAK is the rate-limiting factor in Cdc2\/\ncyclin B1 activation. In addition to this, whilst Plk1 has been\nreported to inhibit the Cdk inhibitor, Wee1, it has been shown that\nan initial Cdk-mediated phosphorylation of Wee1 at Ser121 is\nnecessary to produce a Plk1 docking site, and that this\nphosphorylation event is required for increased Plk1 binding[43].\nIf the Cdk activity in P3 cardiac myocytes is not sufficient to prime\nWee1 for Plk1 binding, over expression of Plk1 alone will not be\nsufficient for Wee1 inhibition and, therefore, an increase in Cdc2\/\ncyclin B1 activity.\nCdc2\/cyclin B1 is involved in some of the early stages of mitosis,\nsuch as the breakdown of the nuclear envelope and chromosome\ncondensation[81]. Because ectopic Cdc2\/cyclin B1 can elicit an\nincrease in the number of adult cardiac myocytes, whilst Plk1 can\nnot, it is possible that in the heart these cells are in an early\/mid-\nG2, rather than in late-G2\/M arrest. As such, the introduction of\nPlk1 into adult myocytes could be too far downstream of this\narrest, and therefore unable to bypass the other events that are\nnecessary to occur before mitosis can take place. Based upon the\nobservations reported here, we sought to characterize the G2\/M\narrest in more detail. Previous reports have suggested that a G2\/M\narrested population of cardiac myocytes exists in the rat adult\nheart.[14,15] To examine this further, we prepared heart sections\nand assessed them for any evidence of mitotic arrest by the\nphosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 or serine 28. Cells\nstaining positive for cardiac myocyte markers and phosphorylation\nof either serine residue declined with age, with virtually no adult\ncardiac myocytes staining positive. The expression of the cell cycle\nmarker, Ki67, was also assessed during rat heart development and\nwas shown to be absent from the adult heart. This data suggests\nthat adult cardiac myocytes are not in a state of \u2018G2\/M\u2019 arrest as\npreviously reported[15], but that the arrest could be earlier, such\nas late S\/G2. This raises questions about the involvement of\nmechanisms of endoreduplication, rather than mitosis, being\nresponsible for cell cycle arrest in the adult cardiac myocyte.\nCardiac myocytes are known to increase in terms of ploidy\nfollowing myocardial infarction[82]. It is possible that the increase\nin ploidy seen in the myocardium surrounding an infarct[82] is an\nattempt at cell division that is inhibited by the absence of Cdk or\nPlk1 activity at G2, leading to rounds of DNA synthesis in the\nabsence of cell division. This may partially explain the presence of\nthe previously reported population of G2\/M nuclei;[15] these\nnuclei may in fact be the product of replication origin re-licensing\nand endoreduplication rather than an aborted mitosis.\nFigure 6.
