In the \nUnited Kingdom (UK), it is the second most common cancer in women and the third \nmost common cancer in men.   \n \nColorectal cancer cases typically arise sporadically in individuals over the age of 50 \n(12), with only a small proportion of patients having a strong inherited predisposition.  \nFurther risk factors relate to diet, bodyweight, physical exercise, tobacco and alcohol \nconsumption (4).   \n \nSurgical resection of the cancer is the main treatment and is almost always performed \nas an open surgical procedure.  Open resection involves one long incision through the \nabdominal wall and is associated with high complication rates.  These complications \ninclude wound infection, post-operative pain, anastomotic leakage, urinary tract \ninfection and long-term complications such as incisional hernia.  Some of the main \ndisadvantages of open resection include incisional pain and an often lengthy \nhospitalisation.  Laparoscopic surgery, a minimally invasive approach, might provide \nan alternative.  Compared with open surgery it is believed to offer short-term quality \nof life benefits (12).  Concerns over its longer-term effectiveness and cost, however, \nhave led to a slow up-take.  Furthermore, laparoscopic surgery is technically more \ncomplicated to perform and its success may be influenced by the experience of the \nsurgical team.   \n \nLaparoscopic surgery involves several small incisions to the abdominal wall, in which \nports are inserted, allowing the surgical instruments to be manipulated.  A variant is \n 6\nlaparoscopically-assisted resection where the bowel is accessed laparoscopically but \nthen a port site incision is enlarged which allows the excision of the disease.  \nAnastomosis is then performed externally.  In practical terms, laparoscopic and \nlaparoscopically-assisted resections can be considered comparable as the incision \nsizes are relatively similar (hereafter they are collectively known as laparoscopic \nsurgery).    \n \nThis study estimated the relative cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic compared with \nopen surgery for the treatment of colorectal cancer as well as exploring the cost-\neffectiveness of the different modes of surgery by stage of disease.   \n \nMETHODS \nMarkov Model \nA Markov model was constructed to estimate the long-term costs and benefits of a \ncohort of typical patients for the alternative surgical treatments (Figure 1).  The model \nfollowed a cohort of patients from initial operation through convalescence (operation \nstate) to return to usual activities (\u2018disease-free\u2019 state).  The patients may remain in \nthis state until they die or they suffer a recurrence or metastasis and therefore have a \nre-operation or some other form of management.  Theoretically, the patients could \nmove between states until they all eventually die.  For the purposes of the analysis, \nthe cohort of patients have been modelled for a maximum of 25 years (the likely \nmaximum survival for the majority of patients).  The cycle length was set at six \nmonths. \n \n 7\nThe main cost components included in the model were the initial operative procedure \nand the costs of subsequent re-operations or management.  If a recurrence occurred \nand a re-operation indicated, the patient is assumed to receive an open procedure.  \nDeath is the only state within the model that a patient cannot leave (it is an absorbing \nstate).   \n \nThe short-term surgical complications were principally captured through increased \noperating times and longer hospitalisation.  The risk of an emergency re-operation \nwithin the first few weeks after surgery was explicitly modelled due to the additional \noperation costs incurred.  Similarly, where the cost of managing other complications \nwere not captured through increased operating time and length of stay, their \nprobability of occurrence and cost was factored into the cost of a state. \n \n 8\nDerivation of Model Parameters of Clinical Effectiveness \nThe strongest source of data required for each parameter in the model were derived \nfrom a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the two \ninterventions in the treatment of colorectal cancer (12).  Data on mortality, recurrence \nrates, re-operation rates, emergency operations and the long-term risk of hernia were \nall taken from this review (12).  In brief, this review, an update of a previous review \nconducted in 2000 (20), involved a systematic literature search, restricted to the years \n2000 onwards.  Full details of the search strategy are available from the authors (12).  \nAll included studies needed to meet pre-specified eligibility criteria.  Standard meta-\nanalysis techniques were used to obtain overall estimates of effectiveness, where \nappropriate, and are reported in detail elsewhere (12).  The review included a total of \n46 reports describing 20 studies (19 RCTs and one individual patient data (IPD) meta-\nanalysis).  The IPD meta-analysis (2), synthesised data from a subset of patients from \nfour of the main RCTs included within the systematic review of effectiveness; (6, 7, \n9, 19).  \n \nThe risk of death and recurrence were taken from the IPD meta-analysis (2) and were \nassigned a constant rate based on consideration of the survival curves which showed a \nsimilar rate, for both interventions (See Table 1 for parameter values used in the \nmodel).  The risk of mortality following the recurrence of non-operative cancer was \nbased on data derived from Benoist and colleagues (1).  A beta distribution was used \nto reflect the uncertainty in this estimate.  Other baseline parameters required for the \nmodel included the risk of: hernia, emergency re-operation for a post-operative \ncomplication; and re-operation for recurrent disease.  The risk of hernia was identified \nas an important long-term complication.  The severity and rates of port site hernia and \n 9\nincisional hernia were included in the model.  As data were sparse it was not possible \nto draw any distinction between the two types of hernia.  The rate of hernia for open \nresection was derived from the rates reported in the open arms of those trials (10, 21) \nidentified by the systematic review of effectiveness and a further focused search of \nnon-randomised studies (5, 18).  The risk of hernia per cycle was estimated for each \nstudy and the median of these was used.  A triangular distribution based on the \nestimated 25 and 75 percentile estimates from the identified studies was used (Table \n1). \n \nIt was believed that the risk of emergency surgery for most post-operative \ncomplications would be low.  The one complication for which an emergency re-\noperation would generally be required was anastomotic leakage and, based on clinical \nadvice, the risk of an emergency re-operation was taken to be equal to the risk of an \nanastomotic leakage (personal communication: Professor Z Krukowski and Ms A \nMcKinley, 2005).  The baseline risk of an anastomotic leakage was based on the rates \nreported in the open arms of those trials identified by the systematic review of \neffectiveness (12).  The point estimate and distribution were defined using the same \nmethod as described above.   \n \nShould the cancer recur the individual might have a re-operation but data on this were \nnot available from any of the included studies.  Data from Grampian University \nHospitals NHS Trust, however, suggested that out of over 300 resections per year, \napproximately 14 to 15 are re-operations (personal communication: Professor Z \nKrukowski and Ms A McKinley, 2005).  A beta distribution was used to reflect \nuncertainty of the point estimate.   \n 10\n Data on relative effect sizes of laparoscopic versus open surgery were derived from \nthe systematic review of effectiveness (12) and the IPD meta-analysis (2).  The \nrelative effect size of the risk of death and recurrence for laparoscopic versus open \nresection were based on the interpretation of the IPD meta-analysis (2) to provide an \nestimate of the relative difference between laparoscopic and open surgery.  A normal \ndistribution was defined using information on the confidence interval surrounding the \nrelative difference. \n \nA relative risk of one was assumed for the mortality rate for individuals with non-\ncurative cancer as prognosis was taken to be the same regardless of the initial method \nof resection (Table 1).  The relative risk of an emergency operation was based on that \nfor anastomotic leakage, which came from the systematic review of effectiveness \n(12).  Based on the confidence interval reported, a lognormal distribution was used to \ndefine the imprecision around this estimate. (Table 1). \n \nThe relative risk of hernia and the relative risk of a re-operation following a \nrecurrence were also required.  In both cases a relative risk of one was assumed.  In \nthe former case the evidence from the review of effectiveness was limited but there \nwas no statistically significant difference between the rates of both types of hernia \n(12).  In the latter case this was because the initial method of resection would not \naffect the method of management subsequent to a recurrence.   \n \nData on Resource Use and Cost \n 11\nTotal costs included initial operation costs, hospital ward costs and any further \nfollow-up costs.  The analysis was taken from a UK NHS perspective and focussed on \ndirect medical costs.  Table 1 shows the estimated costs for laparoscopic and open \nresection.  These costs were derived using data based on a UK RCT comparing \nlaparoscopic with open surgery within an enhanced recovery programme (8).  The \nfollow-up costs from this RCT were only up to three months and related to a fast-\ntrack recovery programme. They do not, therefore, reflect typical length of stay \nestimates.  These data, therefore, were combined with more typical estimates of \nlength of stay and post-operative complications from the systematic review of \neffectiveness (12) to estimate the operation cost incurred in the first six months (i.e. \nthe first cycle of the model).  Added to this cost were the costs of follow-up visits, \nbased on consultation with clinical experts to reflect the frequency of visits.  Costs of \ntwo potential complications were also modelled (risk of emergency surgery and risk \nof incisional or port-site hernia).  The cost per patient was the product of the \nprobability of those complications occurring, combined with standard UK unit costs \n(16).  The cost of care for those patients suffering a recurrence where re-operation \nwould not be indicated was the cost of medications used to control symptoms.  These \nwere based on a typical drug regime of care for a patient, defined following \nconsultation with a MacMillan Cancer Nurse (personal communication: Flora O\u2019Dea \n\u2013 Hospital Specialist Palliative Care Team 2005) (3).   \n \nCost-effectiveness \nThe base-case analysis was based on the costs and outcomes faced by a cohort of \ntypical patients.  Results are presented as incremental cost per additional life year \ngained.  The data are also presented as cost effectiveness acceptability curves \n 12\n(CEACs), which reflect the statistical variability in the model\u2019s input parameters.  \nThese curves illustrate the likelihood that a strategy is cost-effective at various \nthreshold values for society\u2019s willingness to pay for an additional life year.  All costs \nand benefits were discounted, at a rate of 6% for costs and 1.5% for benefits (13).  \nCosts were based on 2004 prices and the analysis was conducted from the perspective \nof the UK NHS. \n \nSensitivity analysis \nIn addition to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis used to generate CEACs, sensitivity \nanalysis focused on varying key assumptions and\/or parameters in the base-case \nmodel.  Sensitivity analyses surrounding the relative survival and disease-free \nsurvival estimates for laparoscopic resection were performed, as they are important \ndrivers within the model and subject to considerable uncertainty.  To further evaluate \nthese estimates, a second analysis using alternative survival and disease-free survival \nestimates for both open and laparoscopic patients, based on the meta-analysis of all \nrelevant trials was conducted (12).  These estimates were manipulated to allow the \nmortality and recurrence rates for laparoscopic compared with open resection to be \nestablished giving point estimates of 0.97 (standard deviation of 0.03) and 0.99 \n(standard deviation of 0.03) respectively.  Given the nature of the data, the \nimprecision around the relative risk was assigned a normal distribution.  Further \nanalysis also considered the use of various quality of life estimates to estimate quality \nadjusted life years (QALYs).  Sensitivity analyses surrounding the base-line risk of \nhernia, mortality rates for patients with non-operative cancer and rates of re-operation \nfollowing recurrence were also conducted.      \n \n 13\nRESULTS \nBase-case and equal survival \nFor the base-case model, laparoscopic is dominated by open resection over the 25-\nyear time horizon; that is laparoscopic resection is more costly and less effective in \ncomparison to open resection (Table 2).  One interpretation of the data provided by \nthe IPD meta-analysis, however, is that there is no difference between laparoscopic \nand open resection in terms of survival and disease-free survival at three years (2).  \nAn analysis assuming equal survival and disease-free survival showed that \nlaparoscopic resection was, again, more costly and no more effective (Table 2).  \nBased on these data alone it would be unlikely that a policy maker would recommend \nincreasing the uptake of laparoscopic surgery.  The point estimates of the incremental \ncost-effectiveness provided do not, however, provide any indication of the uncertainty \nthat surrounds the model parameters.   \n \nFigures 2 and 3 report the CEACs comparing laparoscopic to open surgery in terms of \nlife years for the base-case model and for the equal survival analysis.  Open surgery \nhas a greater chance of being considered cost-effective, for the base-case analysis, at \nthe various threshold values of society\u2019s willingness to pay for a life year.  If society \nwas willing to pay \u00a330,000 for a life year then laparoscopic resection has \napproximately a 30% chance of being considered cost-effective (Figure 2).  The \nresults are driven by very small differences in survival and disease-free survival \nestimated to exist at three years follow-up.  Therefore, an alternative interpretation of \nthe data on survival and disease-free survival is that there are no meaningful \ndifferences and, in this situation, the likelihood that laparoscopic surgery might be \nconsidered cost-effective is greater compared with the base-case analysis (Figure 3).   \n \n 14\nSensitivity analysis \nUsing the two pooled estimates derived for overall survival and disease-free survival \nfrom the meta-analysis resulted in laparoscopic surgery being more costly (by \napproximately \u00a3350) but more effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio \n(ICER) of \u00a31778 (Table 2 and Figure 4).  This result is as would be expected given \nthe pooled estimates on survival and disease-free survival used (12).  This analysis \nserves to highlight the sensitivity of the model to these particular parameter estimates. \n \nUtility data, though sparse, were sought in an attempt to capture the quality of life \ndifferences that might be apparent following the two forms of resection.  Data were \ntaken from one published study using the EQ-5D questionnaire to obtain utility scores \n(17).  Based on these data it has been assumed that the recovery from both open and \nlaparoscopic surgery was associated with a value of 0.83.  It has also been assumed \nthat, by definition, the time spent free from disease was associated with a value of 1.  \nThe value associated with the other states (except death) was also 0.83.  These utility \nestimates were applied to the base-case model.  Both the deterministic and \nprobabilistic analyses are similar to the base-case results (See Table 2).   \n \nThe estimates of QALYs do not capture any potential QALY gain that might be \nassociated with an earlier recovery following laparoscopic surgery.  Some indication \nof the relevance of this was assessed by looking at the QALY gain required for \nlaparoscopic surgery to be judged worthwhile.  Assuming a threshold value for \nsociety\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY of \u00a330,000 (14), and given the mean \nincremental cost of laparoscopic surgery of \u00a3289, then the implied value of the QALY \n 15\ngain would need to be 0.010 QALYs (approximately three and a half days in full \nhealth). \n \nThe results from much of the other sensitivity analyses were similar to the base-case \nresults.  The model was, however, highly sensitive to changes in the relative effect \nsizes associated with non-operable cancer mortality and re-operation rates but there is \nno evidence to suggest that the management of patients would differ between the \ncomparators.  Finally consideration was given to the effect of stage of disease on the \nresults using data presented in the IPD meta-analysis (2).  Results were broadly \nsimilar to the base-case analysis, though there was considerable uncertainty \nsurrounding parameter estimates.  Further evidence on these outcomes, therefore, is \nwarranted. \n \nDISCUSSION \nIt is likely that laparoscopic and open resection are similar in terms of long-term \nsurvival and disease-free survival.  It is also likely that laparoscopic resection has \nsome short-term advantages in terms of recovery in the postoperative period (12).  \nWhen the cost-effectiveness measure was presented in terms of either cost per life \nyear or QALY, laparoscopic surgery was, on average, dominated by open surgery.  \nThese results reflect the very small differences in overall survival that were apparent \nat three years and also the lack of available utility data in which to gauge the impact \nof earlier recovery following laparoscopic surgery.  The results would be greatly \nstrengthened if longer term randomised data were available.  With respect to utilities, \nthe data available to estimate QALYs were meagre and should be treated with \nextreme caution.  Further work in this area is warranted to determine just what level \n 16\nof QALY gain might be apparent following a shorter post-operative recovery and in \nthe long-term.  The importance of this can be ascertained from the fact that only a \n0.01 gain in QALYs would be necessary for laparoscopic surgery to be considered \ncost-effective at a \u00a330,000 threshold.  It is quite plausible that a gain of this \nmagnitude might exist when it is noted that in a comparison between laparoscopic and \nopen groin hernia repair, the observed QALY gain was 0.006 (11).   \n \nSensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effect of changing assumptions \naround the input parameters of the economic model.  In doing so the probability that \nlaparoscopic surgery might be considered cost-effective ranged from 30% to 80%.  \nThe analysis where laparoscopic surgery had an 80% chance of being considered cost-\neffective was when the base-case survival and disease-free survival estimates were \nreplaced with the pooled estimates taken from the systematic review of effectiveness \n(12).  It should be noted, however, that this pooled analysis does not take account of \nany potential differential timing of events. \n \nThere was little information on long-term wound related morbidities such as hernias.  \nIt is likely that the types of hernias and subsequently the costs, management and risk \nof hernia would also be different following both forms of resection.  Because of the \nlack of data, however, the cost, management and associated risks were assumed to be \nthe same for both forms of surgery.  A sensitivity analysis that addressed the impact \nof this assumption showed little impact on results.  Similarly in relation to all costs, \nlittle data were available.  With respect to the main component of costs (the initial \noperation), these were based on data from a very small UK RCT (8).   Further cost \ndata from a larger sample would be beneficial.   \n 17\n One important event associated with laparoscopic surgery that was not modelled \nexplicitly, owing to a lack of useable data, was the effect of conversion.  Laparoscopic \npatients might be converted to open surgery for various reasons.  Often these patients \nhave worse outcomes than those not converted (12).  It is unclear, however, whether \npatients converted to open surgery would have experienced similar complications \nregardless of which form of surgery had first been undertaken (i.e. they were \ninappropriately considered eligible for laparoscopic surgery).  The effects of \nconversion also relate to the level of experience of the particular surgeon and their \nteam.  Less experienced surgeons and surgical teams might be expected to have a \nhigher rate of conversion than those who are more experienced.  The level of \nconversion (and hence cost-effectiveness) is likely, therefore, to be determined not \nonly by appropriate patient selection but also by operator experience.   \n \nThe results were sensitive to changes in the assumption that care for recurrent disease \nwould be the same for both forms of surgery.  There is, however, no evidence to \nsuggest that the management would differ between surgeries.  Should new data \nemerge indicating this then further work to develop this aspect of the model would be \nwarranted. \n \nA subgroup analysis focusing on stage of disease was also conducted.  Its results were \nbased on very meagre data and are unreliable.  Other subgroups that would be \nrelevant to investigate are age, gender and cancer site though it was not possible to \nincorporate these outcomes into the model owing to a lack of useable data.  Further \nanalysis and research for these sub-groups is warranted. \n 18\n CONCLUSION \nThis paper has explored the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal \ncancer.  This study is the first economic evaluation, using a Markov model to predict \nlong-term outcomes, to be conducted within this area.  Laparoscopic surgery is more \ncostly and has a likelihood of being considered cost-effective of between 30% to 80% \ndepending on the assumptions made.  The implied valuation conducted found that, \nassuming a willingness to pay threshold of \u00a330,000, laparoscopic surgery would need \nto be associated with a QALY gain of 0.01 in order to be considered cost-effective. \n \nFurther data is required relating to utility values to assess QALYs, longer term data \nwith regards to survival and disease-free survival, evidence relating to relevant \nsubgroups and on the risk and value of \u2018secondary\u2019 outcomes such as hernias.  \n \nPOLICY IMPLICATIONS  \nA judgement must be made as to whether the guidelines on open surgery should \nchange.  Currently, less than 1% of all colorectal cancer surgeries are performed \nlaparoscopically.  Given the evidence that laparoscopic surgery appears to have \nsimilar long-term outcomes compared to open surgery, as well as being associated \nwith potential short-term benefits, there is a case to increase the current level of \nservice provision.  On the basis of evidence presented in this paper, and other \nevidence, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended that \nlaparoscopic surgery is an acceptable method of surgery for colorectal cancer in the \nUK (15).   \n \n 19\nVery few surgeons or surgical teams are trained in this particular form of surgery and \nthe implications for training of increasing the number of laparoscopic resections \nperformed needs to be considered.  Any decision that might be taken by policy \nmakers with regards to this, however, must take into consideration the extra costs \nassociated with laparoscopic resection and indeed whether the probable quality of life \ngains are worth this increased cost. \n 20\nREFERENCES \n(1) Benoist, S., Pautrat, K., Mitry, E. et al.
