Lett. A 220, 219-223 (1996).\nStochastic resonance (SR), in which a weak periodic signal in a nonlinear system can\nbe enhanced by an increase of the ambient noise intensity, appears to be widespread.\nIt has been observed or invoked in contexts including geophysics [1], lasers [2], passive\noptical systems [3], electronic circuits and devices [4, 5], a Brownian particle in an optical\ntrap [6], a bistable SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) [7], a quantum\n2-level system [8], arrays of SR elements [9], coexisting periodic attractors [10], threshold\ndynamics [11], subcritical bifurcations [12], transient dynamics [13], quasimonochromatic\nnoise [14], crayfish mechanoreceptors [15] and excitable neurons [16]. There have recently\nbeen two topical conferences [17], several general scientific articles [18], and reviews [19,\n20], including one [20] that attempts to place SR in historical context. The vast majority\nof this huge body of work refers to the classical two-state SR that arises in bistable systems\nor threshold dynamics \u2013 an inherently low frequency effect restricted to frequencies that\nare small in comparison with the system\u2019s reciprocal relaxation time. We now report a\nstrong manifestation of SR in a completely different type of system. We have observed\na marked noise-induced enhancement of the signal\/noise ratio (SNR) for high-frequency\nsignals in a monostable SQUID model.\nThe dynamics of the magnetic flux through the periodically driven SQUID loop under\nstudy can be described in terms of a resistively shunted model [21] whose governing\nequation, after appropriate changes of variable (see Fig. 1(a) caption), can be written\nq\u00a8 + \u0393q\u02d9 +\ndU\ndq\n= f(t) + A cos(\u2126t) (1)\nU(q) =\n1\n2\nB(q \u2212 qdc)2 \u2212 cos q (2)\n\u3008f(t)\u3009 = 0, \u3008f(t) f(t\u2032)\u3009 = 2\u0393T\u03b4(t\u2212 t\u2032) (3)\ncorresponding to classical motion in the potential U(q) under influence of the additive\nnoise f(t). We will consider the case where the amplitude A of the periodic force is\nsmall, where the constant \u0393 is also small so that motion in the potential is underdamped,\nand where the relative magnitudes of B and qdc are such that the potential has a single\npotential well, e.g. as shown in Fig.1(b).\nWhy should SR occur at all in a system like that described by equations (1)\u2013(3)?\nThe conventional, intuitively appealing, picture of SR as arising through nearly periodic\nfluctuation-assisted jumps between coexisting attractors (the minima of a bistable poten-\ntial) is clearly inapplicable \u2014 because there is only one attractor. Theories of SR that\n2\nare specific to bistable systems (e.g. [1, 22] are equally inapplicable. The phenomenon\ncan, however, readily be understood in terms of the more general (universally applicable)\nperception of SR [5] in which it is treated as a linear response phenomenon for which\na susceptibility can be defined, in close analogy [20] with the traditional treatments of\nother statistical phenomena in physics such as paramagnetism and electric polarisability\n[23]. If the SNR is defined in the usual way as the ratio of the intensity of the \u03b4-spike in\nthe power spectrum at frequency \u2126 to the height of the smooth fluctuational background\nQ(0)(\u03c9) at the same frequency \u03c9 = \u2126 then [5]\nSNR =\n1\n4\nA2 | \u03c7(\u2126) |2 \/Q(0)(\u2126) (4)\nFor equilibrium (white-noise-driven) systems, the complex susceptibility \u03c7(\u2126) can be\nfound from the fluctuation dissipation theorem and the Kramers-Kronig relations [23]\nand expressed as\nRe [\u03c7(\u2126)] =\n2\nT\nP\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u03b1\n(\n\u03b12\n\u03b12 \u2212 \u21262\n)\nQ(0)(\u03b1)\nIm [\u03c7(\u2126)] =\npi\u2126\nT\nQ(0)(\u2126) (5)\nwhere P denotes the Cauchy principal part and Q(0)(\u2126) is the spectral density in the\nabsence of the periodic force. Perhaps surprisingly, the simplicity, generality and other\nadvantages of treating SR in terms of linear response theory (LRT) did not win immediate\nacceptance. The approach [5] was subsequently vindicated by independent calculations\n[24], however, and has also led to the successful prediction of several completely new forms\nof SR, one of which was SR in monostable systems [25].\nEquations (4) and (5) show that SR will occur in any system for which | \u03c7(\u2126) | rises\nsufficiently fast with increasing noise intensity or, equivalently, whenever Q(0)(\u03c9) in a\nnarrow range near \u03c9 = \u2126 does so. In classical bistable SR, the effect comes from the ex-\nponentially fast rise of a peak [26] in Q(0)(\u03c9) centred on zero-frequency, related to the onset\nof inter-attractor transitions (which is why classical SR can be considered an inherently\nlow-frequency effect). In underdamped monostable (or bistable or multistable) oscillators\nthat have one or more extrema in the variation of their oscillation eigenfrequency \u03c9(E)\nwith energy E, the SR arises because of the appearance of very sharp zero-dispersion\npeaks (ZDPs) [27] in Q(0)(\u03c9) at finite frequency that rise extremely rapidly with noise\nintensity. In the initial search [25] for evidence of SR in a monostable system (a tilted\n3\nDuffing oscillator) the effect found was relatively weak: signal amplification was demon-\nstrated but, because the SNR did not increase, many scientists did not regard the effect as\nbeing properly describable as SR. As we shall see, the SQUID model of equations (1)\u2013(3)\ngives rise to a much more striking manifestation, with SNR increases that are comparable\nto those seen in classical bistable SR and which can in principle become arbitrarily large\nif \u0393 is made sufficiently small.\nThe \u03c9(E) dependence calculated for the SQUID equations (1)\u2013(3) with B = 0.3 and\nqdc = 0, shown in Fig.1(c), exhibits a local maximum and two local minima within the\nrange plotted. Each of these extrema may be expected to produce a ZDP in Q(0)(\u03c9)\nthat could in principle give rise to SR. To test this inference, we have built an analogue\nelectronic model of equations (1)\u2013(3) with \u0393 = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123, using standard techniques\n[28]. When it was driven by quasi-white noise from an external noise generator, with\nA = 0, the measured spectral density Q(0)(\u03c9) underwent dramatic changes of shape with\nincreasing T , as shown in Fig. 2. The three ZDPs appeared sequentially as T \u201ctuned\u201d\nthe oscillator to different ranges of \u03c9(E). When the weak periodic force A cos(\u2126t) was\nalso added, with \u2126 chosen to lie close to the frequency of the local maximum of \u03c9(E) and\nthe corresponding ZDP where | \u03c7 | is expected to be strongly noise-dependent, the SNR\nwas found to vary with increasing T as shown by the data points of Fig. 3. At first the\nSNR falls, as one might expect on intuitive grounds; but there follows a range of T within\nwhich the SNR markedly increases with increasing T , i.e. a strong manifestation of SR,\nbefore falling again at very high T .\nThe theory of these phenomena has been developed on the usual LRT basis: first,\nthe power spectral densities Q(0)(\u03c9) in the absence of the periodic force were calculated\nfor different values of T , by means of an algorithm similar to that described previously\n[29]; secondly, the calculated Q(0)(\u03c9) was inserted in equations (4),(5) to yield the SNR, as\nrequired. The theory, shown by the full curves of Figs. 2 and 3, is in satisfactory agreement\nwith the measurements. It demonstrates that the size of the increase in SNR is related to\nthe magnitude of \u0393 and that, if \u0393 is made small enough, there is in principle no limit to\nthe rise in SNR that can be achieved. Note also that the SQUID parameters in the present\ninvestigations have been chosen so as to provide a monostable potential mainly in order\nto emphasize the marked difference between zero-dispersion SR and conventional SR; but\nzero-dispersion SR will, of course, also occur in SQUIDs with multi-well potentials. A\nfuller discussion of theory and experiment will be presented elsewhere.\nThere are two kinds of conclusion to be drawn. A general observation is that the\n4\npresent results illustrate convincingly the beauty, power, simplicity and generality of the\nLRT approach [5] to SR. On this basis we have successfully predicted the occurrence\nof SR in the system described by equations (1)\u2013(3) and, furthermore, have been able\nto derive a quantitative description of how the SNR varies with noise intensity. But\nthe LRT perception also shows clearly that SR is not restricted to nonlinear systems\nof any particular type: from equations (4),(5), we can confidently anticipate SR in any\nequilibrium system whose spectral density of fluctuations Q(0)(\u03c9) contains sharp peaks\nthat rise rapidly with noise intensity; closely analogous arguments have already been used\nto find SR in a nonequilibrium system [10].\nA particular conclusion is that zero-dispersion SR is to be anticipated in underdamped\nSQUIDs. The optimal frequencies for the SR, i.e. the ZDP frequencies, are tunable over\na very wide range \u2014 in principle running from near zero up to a maximum value not\nmuch less than the Josephson plasma frequency \u2014 by adjustment of the applied static\nmagnetic field and\/or the inductance of the loop. Although the SNR at the output of an\nSR (or any other) device cannot exceed that at the input [20, 30], SR can still be used\nto improve the output SNR of signals that are obliged to pass through the device as may\noccur in biological systems [15, 16], or which originate within it as in SQUIDs where very\nlow-level periodic magnetic fields with ambient noise induce currents directly in the loop\n[21]. The performance of a high-frequency SR device based on an underdamped SQUID\nwould probably be at least comparable with that of the low-frequency SQUID-SR device\nalready successfully demonstrated [7], and it would have the additional advantage of being\ntunable over a wide range of frequencies and SQUID parameters.\nAcknowledgements\nThe research was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Coun-\ncil (UK), the Royal Society of London, and the International Science Foundation.

Perhaps surprisingly, the simplicity, \ngenerality and other advantages of treating SR in \nterms of linear response theory (LRT) did not win \nimmediate acceptance. The approach [5] was subse-\nquently vindicated by independent calculations [24], \nhowever, and has also led to the successful prediction \nof several completely new forms of SR, one of which \nwas SR in monostable systems [25]. \nEqs. ( 4) and ( 5) show that SR will occur in any \nsystem for which Ix< fl) I rises sufficiently fast with \nincreasing noise intensity or, equivalently, whenever \nQ <0l ( w) in a narrow range near w = fl does so. In \nclassical bistable SR, the effect comes from the ex-\nponentially fast rise of a peak [26] in Q<0l(w) cen-\ntred on zero-frequency, related to the onset of inter-\nattractor transitions (which is why classical SR can \nbe considered an inherently low-frequency effect). In \nunderdamped monostable (or bistable or multi stable) \noscillators that have one or more extrema in the vari-\nation of their oscillation eigenfrequency w(E) with \nenergy E, the SR arises because of the appearance \nof very sharp zero-dispersion peaks (ZDPs) [27] in \nQ(O) ( w) at finite frequency that rise extremely rapidly \nwith noise intensity. In the initial search [25] for evi-\ndence of SR in a monostable system (a tilted Duffing \noscillator) the effect found was relatively weak: sig-\nnal amplification was demonstrated but, because the \nSNR did not increase, many scientists did not regard \nthe effect as being properly describable as SR. As we \nshall see, the SQUID model of Eqs. (1)-(3) gives \nrise to a much more striking manifestation, with SNR \nincreases that are comparable to those seen in clas-\nsical bistable SR and which can in principle become \narbitrarily large if I' is made sufficiently small. \nT=0. 36 \na \n0 \nT=1 . 0 \n4 \nC> \n2 \n0 \nT=3.1 \n40 \nC> \n20 \n0 \n0 . 0 0 . 5 1.0 1 . 5 \nFig. 2.

Each of these extrema \nmay be expected to produce a ZDP in Q<0l ( w) that \ncould in principle give rise to SR. To test this inference, \nwe have built an analogue electronic model of Eqs. \n(1)-(3) with I'= 1.1 x 10- 3, using standard tech-\nniques [28]. When it was driven by quasi-white noise \nfrom an external noise generator, with A = 0, the mea-\nsured spectral density Q<0l ( w) underwent dramatic \nchanges of shape with increasing T, as shown in Fig. \n2. The three ZDPs appeared sequentially as T \"tuned\" \nthe oscillator to different ranges of w ( E). When the \nweak periodic force A cos( flt) was also added, with \nfl chosen to lie close to the frequency of the local max-\nimum of w(E) and the corresponding ZDP where lxl \nis expected to be strongly noise-dependent, the SNR \nwas found to vary with increasing T as shown by the \nFigure 2: Spectral density of fluctuations Q(\u03c9) easured (jagged lines) for the analogue\nelectronic model of Eqs.

( 4), ( 5), using the \ncalculated spectral densities Q ( w) of which three examples are \nplotted as dashed lines in Fig. 2. \ndata points of Fig. 3. At first the SNR falls, as one \nmight expect on intuitive grounds; but there follows a \nrange of T within which the SNR markedly increases \nwith increasing T, i.e. a strong manifestation of SR, \nbefore falling again at very high T. \nThe theory of these phenomena has been developed \non the usual LRT basis: firstly, the power spectral den-\nsities Q< 0 l ( w) in the absence of the periodic force \nwere calculated for different values of T, by means of \nan algorithm similar to that described previously [ 29]; \nsecondly, the calculated Q<0l ( w) was inserted in Eqs. \n( 4), ( 5) to yield the SNR, as required. The theory, \nshown by the full curves of Figs. 2 and 3, is in satis-\nfactory agreement with the measurements. It demon-\nstrates that the size of the increase in SNR is related \nto the magnitude of r and that, if r is made small \nenough, there is in principle no limit to the rise in SNR \nthat can be achieved. Note also that the SQUID pa-\nrameters in the present investigations have been cho-\nsen so as to provide a monostable potential mainly \nin order to emphasize the marked difference between \nzero-dispersion SR and conventional SR; but zero-\ndispersion SR will, of course, also occur in SQUIDs \nwith multi-well potentials. A fuller discussion of the-\nory and experiment will be presented elsewhere. \nI \nThere are two kinds of conclusion to be drawn. A \ngeneral observation is that the present results illustrate \nconvincingly the beauty, power, simplicity and gener-\nality of the LRT approach [5] to SR. On this basis \nwe have successfully predicted the occurrence of SR \nin the system described by Eqs. ( 1)-(3) and, further-\nmore, have been able to derive a quantitative descrip-\ntion of how the SNR varies with noise intensity. But \nthe LRT perception also shows clearly that SR is not \nrestricted to nonlinear systems of any particular type: \nfrom Eqs. ( 4), ( 5), we can confidently anticipate SR \nin any equilibrium system whose spectral density of \nfluctuations Q< 0l ( w) contains sharp peaks that rise \nrapidly with noise intensity; closely analogous argu-\nments have already been used to find SR in a nonequi-\nlibrium system [ 10]. \nA particular conclusion is that zero-dispersion SR \nis to be anticipated in underdamped SQUIDs. The op-\ntimal frequencies for the SR, i.e. the ZDP frequencies, \nare tunable over a very wide range - in principle run-\nning from near zero up to a maximum value not much \nless than the Josephson plasma frequency - by adjust-\nment of the applied static magnetic field and\/ or the in-\nductance of the loop. Although the SNR at the output \nof an SR (or any other) device cannot exceed that at \nthe input [20,30], SR can still be used to improve the \noutput SNR of signals that are obliged to pass through \nthe device as may occur in biological systems [ 15, 16], \nor which originate within it as in SQUIDs where very \nlow-level periodic magnetic fields with ambient noise \ninduce currents directly in the loop [21]. The perfor-\nmance of a high-frequency SR device based on an un-\nderdamped SQUID would probably be at least compa-\nrable with that of the low-frequency SQUID-SR device \nalready successfully demonstrated [7], and it would \nhave the additional advantage of being tunable over a \nwide range of frequencies and SQUID parameters. \nThe research was supported by the Engineering and \nPhysical Sciences Research Council (UK), the Royal \nSociety of London, and the International Science \nFoundation.
