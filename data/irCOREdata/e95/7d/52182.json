Attributes most often reported to represent MT include having unshakeable \nself-belief, coping effectively with pressure and adversity, being resilient, thriving on \npressure, being committed, and having superior concentration skills (Connaughton, Hanton, & \nJones, 2010; Crust, 2008; Sheard, 2010). As such, MT represents a constellation of positive \npsychological variables that help to buffer the harmful effects of stress and allow individuals \nto perform consistently well regardless of situational factors (Clough, Earle, & Sewell, 2002). \nHowever, recent researchers have suggested that MT is more than a resistance resource that \noperates in times of adversity, and that MT also enables appropriate focus and motivation \nwhen things are going well (Gucciardi, Gordon, & Dimmock, 2008). There is still debate \nconcerning whether MT is more stable and trait-like, or a mind-set that can be manipulated \nthrough training and experience (cf. Crust, 2008; Sheard, 2010). With describing MT as a \npsychological edge that may be \u201cnatural or developed\u201d, Jones et al. (2007, p. 247) implicate \nthe importance of both nature and nurture. Recent research suggests that the development of \nMT is a long-term and complex process that is influenced by personal qualities, \nenvironmental conditions, and critical incidents (Connaughton et al., 2010).  \nClough, et al. (2002) proposed the 4C\u2019s model of MT1 that is represented by: (1) \nchallenge, the extent to which individuals see problems as opportunities for self-development; \n(2) commitment, as opposed to alienation, which reflects deep involvement with whatever one \nis doing; (3) emotional control concerns keeping anxieties in check; (4) life control reflects a \ntendency to feel and act as if one is influential; (5) confidence in abilities involves a high \n                                                     \n1Six components of the 4C\u2019s model are presented because control and confidence each have two sub-\ncomponents. \n \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  4\nsense of self belief and less dependency on external validation; and (6) interpersonal \nconfidence reflects being assertive when interacting with others.   \nMuch early MT research was qualitative and aimed at establishing a clear \nconceptualization of the construct (cf. Sheard, 2010). While qualitative research helped to \nidentify some of the key attributes of mentally tough athletes, much less attention was given \nto issues of measurement (Crust, 2008; Sheard, Golby, & van Wersch, 2009). However, \nClough et al. (2002) produced an instrument that has since been used in numerous studies \n(i.e., Crust & Clough, 2005; Kaiseler, Polman, & Nicholls; 2009; Nicholls, Polman, Levy & \nBackhouse, 2008). Despite much published research using the Mental Toughness \nQuestionnaire 48 (MTQ48; Clough et al.), some researchers (i.e., Sheard et al., 2009) have \nbeen critical of the measure on two counts: First, the conceptualization that underpins the \nMTQ48; and second, the lack of independent scrutiny of the factor structure.  \nInitial work by Clough et al. (2002) involved interviews with professional athletes, \ncoaches, and sport psychologists. The resultant conceptualization of MT bore a close \nresemblance to psychological hardiness, although Clough et al. proposed that MT and \nhardiness were related yet distinct constructs. Furthermore, the factor structure that emerged \nfrom this research appears consistent with the key attributes of MT that have since been \nidentified in numerous qualitative studies. For example, confidence or self-belief, aspects of \ncontrol and thriving on challenges have all been consistently reported as key components of \nMT (Crust, 2008; Jones et al., 2007; Sheard, 2010). Furthermore, recent research aimed at \nestablishing psychological characteristics that facilitate a pathway to elite sport performance, \nincluded factors that either explicitly (i.e., self-belief, commitment) or implicitly (i.e., \ncompetitiveness, coping under pressure) correspond to the 4C\u2019s model (Macnamara, Button, \n& Collins, 2010).      \nThere is evidence to support the validity and reliability of the MTQ48. Clough et al. \n(2002) found differences in cognitive performance following negative feedback and in ratings \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  5\nof exertion during a strenuous physical task, between participants with high and low levels of \nMT (using the MTQ48). Work by Crust and Clough (2005) supported construct validity of the \nMTQ48 with significant relations found between MTQ48 scores and pain tolerance. Research \nhas also found significant relations between MTQ48 scores, optimism and coping skills \n(Nicholls et al., 2008). In terms of reliability, the overall internal consistency of the MTQ48 \nhas generally been reported at 0.9 or above (i.e., Kaiseler et al., 2009). Despite such evidence, \ncritics have highlighted the need for further psychometric testing. Independent researchers \nrecently tested the factor structure of the MTQ48 using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). \nHorsburgh, Schermer, Veselka, and Vernon (2009) reported support for the factor structure of \nthe MTQ48 and significant relations between MT and other personality factors. \nUnfortunately, Horsburgh et al. did not provide a full report of the CFA data such as fit \nindices. However, Horsburgh et al. did find that MT behaves, \u201cin the same manner as \nvirtually every personality trait that has ever been investigated in behavioral genetic study.\u201d \n(p. 104). \nRecently, Sheard et al. (2009) developed a multidimensional measure of MT called the \nSports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ). These researchers developed items for the \nSMTQ by using raw data themes and quotes from previous qualitative studies of MT. Two \nstudies, including 1142 participants supported a three-factor model for the SMTQ plus a \nhigher order factor using both exploratory and CFA. The SMTQ measures global MT and \nthree subscales (i.e., confidence, constancy, and control). According to Sheard (2010), the \nconfidence subscale measures athletes\u2019 belief in their own abilities to achieve goals and be \nbetter than their opponents. Constancy reflects determination, personal responsibility, an \nunyielding attitude, and ability to concentrate. Finally, control in the SMTQ is concerned with \nthe perception that one is personally influential and can bring about desired outcomes with \nparticular reference to controlling emotions.    \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  6\nSheard et al. (2009) provide evidence that the SMTQ possesses satisfactory \npsychometric properties, with adequate reliability, divergent validity, and discriminative \npower. The internal consistency of factors was found to be good, with all alpha coefficients \nabove 0.7. Low to moderate correlations between related, yet distinct concepts (e.g., \nhardiness, optimism) provide support for discriminant validity, while evidence for differences \nin MT relating to age, gender and competitive standard were also found. However, Sheard et \nal. recommended further testing of the construct validity of the SMTQ.      \nIn developing instruments to test constructs within sport domains, researchers have \nemphasized the importance of a multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) approach to test the \nconvergent and discriminant validity of measurement instruments (see Marsh, 2007). This \napproach involves instruments purporting to measure the same or substantially overlapping \nscales to be administered to the same participants. A systematic evaluation of correlations \nbetween scales from different instruments is conducted, which includes matching (i.e., similar \nor identical content) and non-matching comparisons. Large correlations between matching \nscales provides support for convergent validity. When correlations in matched scales are \nhigher than in non-matched scales, support for discriminant validity is provided. Marsh details \nhow this approach has been used to establish construct validity in physical self-concept.  \nMarsh (2007) suggests that MTMM analyses can help to reveal problems based upon \nthe labels given to scales. While instruments such as those posited to measure MT, contain \nsimilar or even identical labels for scales, it can not be assumed that these are measuring the \nsame construct. For example, the jingle fallacy concerns two measures that are given the same \nlabel, but are inappropriately assumed to measure the same construct (when in fact they are \nmeasuring different constructs). In contrast, the jangle fallacy occurs when different labels are \ninappropriately assumed to measure different constructs (when in fact they are measuring the \nsame construct). Thus, only through testing such relations can researchers interpret whether \nmeasures of MT are measuring the same, or different factors.  \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  7\nGiven that both the MTQ48 and the SMTQ have been used to measure MT in the \nextant literature, it is necessary to understand how these measures relate to each other. \nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that other instruments have been developed to \nmeasure MT. For example, the Mental Toughness Inventory (MTI; Middleton, Marsh, Martin, \nRichards, & Perry, 2004a) is a 67-item instrument that measures 12 components of MT. \nWhile the MTI was developed via a construct validation approach, the instrument appears \nsomewhat limited given that validation was restricted to 12-19 year old participants. The MTI \nhas not been fully tested or frequently employed within the extant literature (Sheard, 2010). \nGucciardi and colleagues have developed measures that are specific to particular sports such \nas Australian football (Gucciardi, Gordon, & Dimmock, 2009) and cricket (Gucciardi & \nGordon, 2009). While these instruments appear to have developed through rigorous \npsychometric procedures, they are for sole use in designated sports. In contrast, most \nresearchers contend that core components of MT exist, and will be required across sports \n(Jones et al., 2007; Sheard, 2010).  \nThe two instruments used in this study were both general measures of MT (rather than \nmeasures specific to individual sports), with the MTQ48 being the most frequently employed \nmeasure of MT in published academic research to date, while the SMTQ is a newer \ninstrument, but with seemingly impressive psychometric properties (Sheard, 2010). While the \nconceptualization and development of these two instruments has been somewhat different, \nthere appears to be some similarity (i.e., confidence, control) in terms of the reported scales. \nHowever, there is a danger that if researchers are comparing findings between these \ninstruments, they are not aware of differences that exist between scales. The aim of this study \nwas to take a MTMM approach to further test the construct validity of the MTQ48 and \nSMTQ.        \nMethod \nParticipants \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  8\nParticipants were 110 male club and University athletes (M age = 20.81 years, SD = \n2.76). All participants had at least one year of experience in their chosen sport (M experience \n= 9.34 years, SD = 5.43). The sample consisted of athletes who were mostly team sport \nplayers (i.e., soccer, rugby union etc.) and represented 10 sports.  \nInstruments \nParticipants provided demographic information and were given a booklet that included \ntwo measures of MT. The MTQ48 (Clough et al., 2002) is a 48-item inventory that requires \nresponses to statements on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree, to (5) \nstrongly agree. The MTQ48 provides a total MT score and measures six subscales of \nchallenge, commitment, emotional control, life control, confidence in abilities and \ninterpersonal confidence. Example items include \u201cChallenges usually bring out the best in \nme\u201d (challenge); \u201cI don\u2019t usually give up under pressure\u201d (commitment); \u201cI can usually \ncontrol my nervousness\u201d (emotional control); \u201cI generally feel in control\u201d (life control); \u201cI am \ngenerally confident in my own abilities\u201d (confidence in abilities); and \u201cI usually speak my \nmind when I have something to say\u201d (interpersonal confidence).  Independent researchers \nhave provided support for the factor structure of the questionnaire using CFA (Horsburgh et \nal., 2009). Support for the validity and reliability of the MTQ48 has previously been reported \n(cf. Clough et al., 2002). \n The SMTQ (Sheard et al., 2009) was also used to measure MT. The 14-item SMTQ \nprovides a global measure of MT as well as the three subscales of confidence, constancy, and \ncontrol. Participants respond to items using a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from (1) not at all \ntrue, to (4) very true. Sample items include \u201cI have unshakeable confidence in my ability\u201d \n(confidence); \u201cI get distracted easily and lose my concentration\u201d (constancy); and \u201cI get \nanxious by events I did not expect or cannot control\u201d (control). CFA has provided support for \nthe three subscales and a global measure of MT.  \nProcedure   \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  9\nPrior to the distribution of questionnaires, comparisons were made between the \ncontent of items from the 11 scales (7 MTQ48 and 4 SMTQ). Predictions were made based \nupon the degree of similarity between scales. The MTQ48 subscale of confidence in abilities \nclosely resembled SMTQ confidence. The MTQ48 subscale of emotional control appeared \nsimilar to SMTQ control. Constancy on the SMTQ seemed to be most closely related to \ncommitment from the MTQ48. As such, these relations were predicted to be strong (i.e., r \u2265 \n.70), as was the relationship between total MT and global MT. The second author then \ncontacted organizers of sports teams to gain permission to distribute questionnaires, after \ngaining approval by a University Research Ethics Committee. Participants were given \nassurances of confidentiality and each provided written consent prior to completing the \nquestionnaires. Most questionnaires were completed following training sessions.  \nData analysis \nData was visually screened for outliers and checked for normality. Descriptive \nstatistics were calculated on all study variables. The internal consistency of the MTQ48 and \nSMTQ were calculated and compared to previously published data. Pearson correlations were \nused to test for relationships between scales and subscales.  \nResults \nDescriptive data from responses to the MTQ48 and the SMTQ can be viewed in Table \n1. Pearson correlations between scales from the MTQ48 and the SMTQ, as well as the alpha \ncoefficients can be viewed in Table 2. The overall internal consistency of the MTQ48 and the \nSMTQ were found to be good (.91 and .81 respectively). However, two subscales from each \nof the questionnaires were found to have problems with internal consistency (\u03b1 <.70). Both of \nthe MTQ48 control subscales (emotional and life control), and the SMTQ subscales of \nconstancy and control had inadequate internal consistency. Follow-up correlational analyses \nwere conducted in an attempt to highlight any items which appeared to fit poorly within the \nsubscale. With regard to MTQ48 emotional control (lowest internal consistency) item 34, \u201cI \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  10\ngenerally hide my emotions from others\u201d was found to be unrelated to the subscale but was \nsignificantly and negatively correlated with three other subscale items. While all of the items \nfrom the MTQ48 life control subscale, and the SMTQ subscales of constancy and control, \nwere found to be significantly and positively related to the subscale in question, a number of \nitems were found to be unrelated to each other. As predicted, the higher order scores from the \nquestionnaires (total MT and global MT) were found to be significantly correlated (r = .75). \nThe scales predicted to be highly (i.e., r \u2265 .70) and significantly related (MTQ48 confidence \nin abilities and SMTQ confidence; MTQ48 emotional control and SMTQ control; and \nMTQ48 commitment and SMTQ constancy) were all found to be significantly related but \nwith moderate as opposed to high correlations (.56, .49, and .61 respectively). Overall, the \nhighest correlations between MTQ48 and SMTQ subscales were found to be: MTQ48 \nchallenge and SMTQ confidence (r = .62); MTQ48 Commitment and SMTQ constancy (r = \n.61); and MTQ48 commitment and SMTQ confidence (r = .59).       \nDiscussion \nAs predicted, a significant and positive correlation was found between higher order \nMT as measured by the MTQ48 and SMTQ respectively. The size of relationship between \ntotal, and global MT was large (r = .75) but accounts for only 56% of common variance. As \nsuch, 44% of variance between the measures remains unexplained. While the MTQ48 and \nSMTQ are significantly related, it would appear that they are measuring somewhat different \ncomponents of MT. Marsh (2007) outlined criteria for establishing both convergent and \ndiscriminant validity using systematic evaluation of correlations between instruments \npurporting to measure the same or substantially overlapping scales. Marsh stressed the need \nfor large correlations between matching scales (convergent validity) and larger correlations \nthan non-matching scales (discriminant validity). With respect to the MTQ48 and SMTQ, \nmatched subscales were found to be significantly related, but with moderate, rather than \nstrong relations. Moreover, correlations between non-matched subscales (i.e., MTQ48 \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  11\nchallenge and SMTQ confidence) were found to be equally as high as matched subscales. \nThus, while there is evidence for substantial overlap between the higher order factors \nmeasured by the MTQ48 and SMTQ, subscales purporting to measure similar components of \nMT (i.e., confidence, control) are not measuring the same factor (i.e., jingle fallacy). Thus \nresearchers must be aware that these two measures overlap but are not measuring identical \ncomponents of MT. As such, comparisons between evidence derived from these measures \nshould be interpreted cautiously.  \n The descriptive data from the MTQ48 was similar to that reported by Kaiseler et al. \n(2009) while the SMTQ scores were slightly higher than previously reported norms for club \nor regional athletes (cf. Sheard et al., 2009). While the overall internal consistency of each \nmeasure was found to be good, problems with two subscales on each instrument were evident. \nIn particular, the two subscales of control on the MTQ48 (emotional and life control) and the \nsubscales of control and constancy on the SMTQ were found to have inadequate internal \nconsistency (\u03b1 <.70). Previous researchers have reported similar problems with the MTQ48 \nsubscale of emotional control (Kaiseler et al., 2009). One of the seven emotional control \nsubscale items was found to be unrelated to the scale and negatively correlated with other \nitems. The internal consistency of SMTQ control and constancy were found to be lower than \npreviously reported (cf. Sheard et al., 2009). It must be acknowledged that the sample size in \nthe present research is significantly lower than those used in the development of either \ninstrument and this may have contributed to such findings. Nevertheless, there are numerous \nexamples in sport psychology literature where instruments have been refined to improve \npsychometric properties. Establishing validity and reliability is an ongoing process. In \nparticular, the MTQ48 subscale of emotional control appears to be in need of further \nrefinement.  \nOne possible reason for the moderate, rather than large correlations found between the \nmatched subscales of the instruments is evident in closer examination of subscale items. For \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  12\nexample, while Sheard et al. (2009) provide clear criteria for establishing factor solutions for \nthe SMTQ, in terms of some of the items, the logical validity might be questioned. For \nexample, one item pertaining to measure confidence (I can regain my composure if I have \nmomentarily lost it) seems more logically connected with control. Regaining composure \nsuggests asserting internal control rather than being confident. Another item from the SMTQ \nconfidence scale (I interpret potential threats as positive opportunities) appears to more \nclosely resemble the challenge scale of the MTQ48, which Clough et al. (2002) described as \nthe extent to which individuals see problems as opportunities for self-development. This \noffers a partial explanation for why SMTQ confidence was more strongly related to MTQ48 \nchallenge (.62) than to MTQ confidence in abilities (.56).  \n Furthermore, the term committed or commitment is referred to in items from both the \nconstancy and confidence subscales of the SMTQ. The final item of the SMTQ (under \npressure, I am able to make decisions with confidence and commitment) appears to tap more \nthan one factor. While a reasonable argument could be forwarded for confidence and \ncommitment to be related, most theorists would agree they are not synonymous (Crust, 2008). \nThe items measuring constancy on the SMTQ also appear to tap a wide range of factors from \nconcentration (I get distracted easily and lose my concentration) to personal responsibility (I \ntake responsibility for setting myself challenging targets); it is difficult to see how these \nlogically fit together within one scale as a loss of concentration appears more akin to lack of \nattentional control. Indeed, a recently developed MT inventory specific to cricket (Gucciardi \n& Gordon, 2009) reported a five-factor model that included affective intelligence, attentional \ncontrol, resilience, self-belief, and desire to achieve. With just three-factors (confidence, \nconstancy, and control) it appears that the SMTQ has combined into single scales, \ncomponents that other research groups have identified as being independent in models of MT \n(see Jones et al., 2007; Middleton, Marsh, Martin, Ricahrds, & Perry, 2004b). Although \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  13\npsychometric testing is a crucial component of developing measurement instruments, logical \nvalidity must also be given high priority.  \nLow internal consistency for some of the MTQ48 and SMTQ scales could provide an \nexplanation for the lower than expected correlations between MTQ48 and SMTQ scales. For \nexample, it is possible that emotional control from the MTQ48 and control from the SMTQ \nare more highly correlated, but low scale reliabilities could be adding additional unexplained \nvariance that masks the true relationship. However, this does not explain why the correlations \nbetween confidence subscales were lower than expected, because confidence scales on both \nmeasures had at least adequate reliability. Knight and Vealey (2002) reported evidence for \nself-confidence being a multidimensional construct. While both the MTQ48 and SMTQ \npurport to measure confidence in one\u2019s ability, both instruments contain items that appear to \nextend beyond this narrow focus which has probably contributed to unexplained variance. In \nthe case of the MTQ48, some items appear to resemble self-esteem rather than self-\nconfidence (i.e., feelings of worthiness).  \nWhile the MTQ48 and SMTQ both purport to measure MT, and there is a good degree \nof overlap between items and scales, the present study has found only moderate relations \nbetween scales. As Marsh (2007) has previously outlined, the MTMM approach can help to \nestablish discriminant and convergent validity, but it can also highlight problems with the \ninterpretation of scales. Researchers need to be mindful of the present findings when \ncomparing the results of research using these instruments. Both instruments appear to tap the \ncore components of MT but the MTQ48 seemingly provides a more comprehensive measure. \nWhile both instruments have been developed using athletic populations, the inclusion of \nscales measuring components of MT beyond sport (i.e., life control, interpersonal confidence) \nmakes the MTQ48 more applicable for use in other settings (business, education etc.). \nHowever, the brevity of the SMTQ is likely to make it a popular instrument in applied sports \nsettings, especially given the reported ability to discriminate between athletes of higher or \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  14\nlower skill levels. However, the constancy scale of the SMTQ appears to represent a \ncombination of important components of MT (e.g., challenge, commitment, concentration) \nthat might be more appropriately measured through separate scales.  \nAlthough there appears to be an emerging consensus concerning the core attributes of \nMT (Sheard, 2010) with components such as control integral to most models, it is apparent \nthat different research groups are developing instruments that measure somewhat different \ncomponents of MT. For example, both Clough et al. (2002) and Gucciardi and Gordon (2009) \nacknowledge control as a core component of MT, but the former emphasize both emotional \nand life control, while attentional control is proposed by the latter. One of the problems faced \nby MT researchers attempting to develop measures of the construct is that MT is composed of \na number of positive psychological variables that are themselves multidimensional in nature. \nUntil conceptual differences are resolved, scales are likely to be found to be related yet \ndistinct. More research efforts are required to establishing greater conceptual clarity, and in \ndeveloping and refining psychometric instruments to measure MT.  \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  15\nTable 1  \nDescriptive Statistics for the MTQ48 and SMTQ (N = 110) \n  \n  \n M s \nMental toughness (MTQ48) 174.55 19.57 \nChallenge 30.08 4.02 \nCommitment 41.22 5.82 \nEmotional control 22.91 3.15 \nLife control 24.92 3.21 \nConfidence in abilities 32.53 5.07 \nInterpersonal confidence 22.90 3.90 \nMental toughness (SMTQ) 41.25 6.06 \nConfidence 17.21 3.29 \nConstancy 13.08 1.96 \nControl 10.96 2.48 \n \n  \nMEASURES OF MENTAL TOUGHNESS  16\nTable 2  \nPearson Correlations between the MTQ48 and SMTQ (N = 110) \n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \n1.
