Using  a\nrange of teaching styles and techniques, the programmes (MScs  in  Tourism  Marketing;\nTourism Management  and  Tourism  Development,  with  a  fourth  MSc  in  International\nEvents  Management  being  introduced  subsequent  to   data   collection),   have   been\ndesigned  specifically  to  offer  students   an   in-depth   grounding,   understanding   and\nappreciation of both the theoretical and applied aspects of tourism.  Thus,  in  addition  to\nthe high level  of  academic  content,  the  learning  environment  also  embraces  current\nindustry practice via a range of guest lectures, fieldtrips as well as the inclusion of current\nresearch findings within teaching material. Nevertheless, it was felt that the  programmes\nlacked the opportunities  afforded  by  direct  and  prolonged  industry  contact.  The  aim,\ntherefore, was to  establish  a  means  of  enabling  students\u2019  first-hand  connection  with\nindustry as an integral element of  their  learning  experience.  Thus,  the  initiative  would\nprovide students with the opportunity to widen the scope  of  their  current  study  to  work\ndirectly with  industry,  enhance  their  employability,  and  provide  support  for  students\u2019\npersonal and professional  development.  Finally,  the  introduction  of  such  an  initiative\nholds  the  potential  to  increase  the  competitiveness  of  tourism   programmes   in   an\nincreasingly demanding and competitive market place.\nThe outcome was the development of the Applied Dissertation (AD) initiative.  Embracing\nthe opportunity for direct industry connection, ADs offer students a pathway  to  complete\ntheir MSc dissertation via an industry-led  and  devised  research  project  that  highlights\nareas of current concern to industry partners. The first section of the paper considers  the\ndevelopmental stages of concretising the AD  initiative.  The  paper  then  conceptualises\nlearning through ADs and explores the opportunities afforded by introducing this mode of\nstudy into postgraduate tourism programmes. First, drawing upon the pedagogy of  work-\nbased learning, it suggests ADs afford  students  the  opportunity  to  engage  in  learning\nthrough work or indeed learning for work (Gray, 2001). Learning is therefore  made  more\neffective as it emerges as a fusion of applying classroom-based knowledge and  learning\nby   engaging   directly   with   industry.   Secondly,   as   learning   demands   the    direct\nincorporation of external  agents  and  knowledges,  ADs  emerge  as  complex  adaptive\nsystems;  a  series  of  dynamic,  fluid  and  complex  interrelations.   Finally,   the   paper\npresents the ways in which ADs encourage students to become reflexive practitioners  as\nthey review and learn from their experiences. Thus, ADs facilitate learning as a  series  of\nactive performances that emerge through the dynamic triangulation of student,  academic\nsupervisor and industry provider.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe project was initially researched and implemented over the academic  years  2006-07\nand 2007-08. Secondary and primary data collection was conducted throughout  2006-07\nwith  the  final  AD  initiative  being  implemented  in  September  2007.  The  initiative   is\ntherefore now in its third year with the third cohort of students currently  engaged  in  their\ndissertation research.\nFirst,  analysis  was  conducted  on  both  competitor  and  University  MSc   programmes\noffering industry\/placement opportunities to taught MSc students.  A  competitor  analysis\nwas conducted with all other UK Universities currently offering Tourism MSc programmes\nwith options of work placements. Key  findings  indicated  that  while  the  opportunity  for\nindustry  connection  was  limited.  Some  universities  offered  formal  work   placements\nwhereby students spent between 6 and 12 months working in  industry.  Such  placement\nopportunities either prior to starting study or  alternatively  on  completion  of  the  degree\nprogramme. Finally, one institution offered students  the  opportunity  to  complete  \u201cshort\nplacements\u201d during the course  of  their  studies.  In  support  of  the  external  competitor\nanalysis, an internal analysis of current University practice was also completed.  Findings\nprovided a cross-section of programmes across three faculties including health care  and\nnursing; environmental strategy; and performing arts. The results of these initial analyses\nindicated  that  the  most  common  formats  for  introducing  direct   industry   contact   to\nstudents was through: the introduction  of   a  placement  year,  work  placements  as  an\nelective module and finally, informal \u2018work shadowing\u2019. In addition to what was to become\nthe Applied Dissertation initiative, these provided the foundation for  the  development  of\nfour key models for the introduction of direct industry  contact  in  our  MSc  programmes.\nEach of these will be discussed later in the paper.\nSecondly, a vital component  of  the  development  of  the  AD  initiative  was  gaining  an\nunderstanding the perspectives of the students  currently  studying  on  the  tourism  MSc\nprogrammes. A focus group was therefore  conducted  with  a  sample  of  MSc  students\nfrom  across  the  three  Tourism  MSc  programmes.  In  total  5   students   participated,\nproviding a sample of approximately 10%  of  the  tourism  postgraduate  student  cohort.\nThe  sample  ranged  in:  programme  studied,  gender,  age,  nationality,   future   career\ndirection,  and  previous  work  experience.  Students  were  recruited   via   email,   were\nprovided with an information sheet and were required to sign a consent  form  before  the\nfocus group started. Research was conducted early in the second semester and students\nhad already attended a \u201cdissertation ideas session\u201d and submitted dissertation  proposals\nfor their forthcoming research. As such, they were familiar with their  courses,  the  range\nof teaching and learning styles, assessments,  had  experience  of  selecting  dissertation\ntopics and had completed a sufficient percentage  of  their  studies  to  be  able  to  make\ninformed  and  reasoned  comment  on  the  perceived  benefits   and   shortfalls   of   the\nconceptual and logistical processes of the AD initiative.\nDiscussion emerged around a series of key issues including: the perceived  benefits  and\nopportunities,  limitations  or  problems  associated  with  ADs;  the  benefits  of   industry\nengagement through research; the opportunity for engaging in \u2018real\u2019 current issues facing\nindustry; perceived opportunities for enhancing employability, personal  and  professional\ndevelopment;  and,  the  attractiveness  of  ADs  in  establishing  competitive  advantage.\nStudents were encouraged to speak freely within an  informal  setting  (Veal,  2006).  The\ninformality  and  conversational  nature  of  the  focus  group  also  allowed   flexibility   as\nstudents were encouraged to reflect upon their own experiences or the potential  benefits\nor limitations of this alternative mode of  study  (see  Cloke,  Crang,  Goodwin,  Painter  &\nPhilo, 2003; Mason, 2002).  This  was  particularly  important  as  students  were  able  to\nhighlight issues that had previously eluded consideration. The focus group was  recorded\nand transcribed verbatim and  pseudonyms  were  used.  Data  were  analysed  manually\nusing thematic analysis from which key issues were identified (Denzin & Lincoln, 1998).\nFinally, in addition to the student perspective, it was particularly important  to  secure  the\nindustry perspective to assess the viability and feasibility of the AD model. Short, informal\nconversational interviews were held  with  14  potential  providers.  Interviews  were  held\nboth  face-to-face  during  meetings  or  over  the  telephone.  Potential   providers   were\nidentified via a purposive sampling method (see Saunders, Lewis & Thornhill,  2003)  and\nidentified  a  range  of  respondents  including:  tour  operators,  travel   journalists,   non-\nGovernmental organisations, charities, societies, and tourist offices. Prior to  discussions,\nall  potential  providers  were  emailed  two  documents  outlining   the   \u201ckey   issues   for\nemployers\u201d and the proposed \u201ctimeline\u201d at which each  stage  of  the  AD  process  would\ntake place (see Figure 1). Such was the  positive  response  to  the  AD  initiative  that  all\nindustry respondents subsequently offered research projects as ADs.\nTOWARDS A MODEL FOR APPLIED DISSERTATIONS\nAs  aforementioned,  four  models  were  identified  as  potential   pathways   to   develop\npostgraduate  opportunity  for  industry  contact.  These  were:   the   introduction   of   an\nadditional placement year, an elective module and informal \u2018work shadowing\u2019  as  well  as\nwhat was to become the  AD  initiative.  Attention  now  turns  to  the  processes  through\nwhich each option was developed and evaluated before final conclusions were drawn  as\nto  the   suitability,   relevance,   applicability   and   viability   of   each   as   meeting   the\nrequirements of this initiative.\nExtending Current MSc to a 2-year Programme with 1-Year Placement\nFollowing the practice of some competitors, the first of the options  considered  proposed\nthe  extension  of  current  one  year  programmes  to  become   one   year   taught   MSc\nprogramme with an additional year long placement before graduation. This  model  would\ninclude an \u2018opt-out\u2019 option should students not  be  able  to  find  a  placement.  However,\nafter  discussion  with  colleagues  and  senior  management  and   with   feedback   from\nstudents, this option was rejected. Indeed, while several authors highlight the  benefits  of\nyear long placements (or internships)  (see  for  example  Busby,  2003;  Busby,  Brunt  &\nBaber,  1997;  Leslie  &  Richardson,  2000),   citing:   broadening   knowledge,   creating\nawareness,  influencing  career  choice,  including  the  development   of   students   both\npersonally  and  professionally  in  \u201cadherence  to  business  values\u201d  (Tribe,  2001),   this\nrelates predominantly to undergraduate rather than postgraduate study. Indeed,  findings\nsuggest  the  benefits  of  offering  industry  connection  are  in  fact  outweighed  by   the\nadditional year required to complete the programme of study at  postgraduate  level.  Not\nonly would such a move compromise the competitiveness of  programmes,  but  students\ncited increased financial costs and associated  implications  as  limiting  the  viability  and\nattractiveness of an additional year. The negative consequence of this  was  unanimously\nexpressed by students and as Mary suggested:\n\u201cbecause this Masters degree is quite  expensive  for  all  of  us  and  we  chose  it\nbecause of the name and the School\u2026it is still a high price. It  is  a  sacrifice.  The\npossibility to do this kind of experience is really, really, really good but  if  it  affects\nthe price\u201d\u2026. \u201cabsolutely I would choose one year\u201d.\nFinally, compounding students\u2019 aversion to an additional year was the issue of visas  and\nvisa requirements. While home and EU students would not require visas to  engage  in  a\nplacement year, international students would be subject to  extended  visa  requirements.\nIn turn, this would require the course be officially recognised as  a  two  year  programme\nas in order to receive visas, the work placement cannot  extend  beyond  the  end  of  the\ncourse. Additionally, as part of tier four requirements, the University is required  to  report\non student attendance or lack  thereof  during  the  course  of  their  studies.  Thus,  such\nreporting may prove potentially problematic as the  University  would  become  reliant  on\nplacement providers for the collation of such data.\nIntroducing a Placement Elective Module\nThe second option, the introduction of a placement as elective  module,  would  comprise\nof a 4-6 week placement block at the end of the second semester before  students  begin\ndissertation research. While  providing  students  intensive  industry  experience,  several\nconcerns arose. With regard to teaching, concerns arose regarding contact time  and  the\nquality  of  learning  students  would  receive  in  a  relatively  short   industry   placement.\nRegarding logistics, concerns arose as students would be required to secure placements\nin  their  first  semester  to  ensure  participation  to  ensure  where  no  placements  were\nsecured students were able to select  a  replacement  module.  Indeed,  the  demands  to\nfind, apply for and secure such placements were  felt  to  place  new  students  under  too\nmuch pressure. As Tucker & Ang (2007) suggest, for international students  in  particular,\nthe acclimatisation process for new students can  bring  with  it  a  range  of  experiences\nincluding:\n\u201cheightened  physical  and  emotional  upheaval  attributed  to  displacement   and\nacclimatisation to a new environment, feelings of anxiety, loss  of  control,  lack  of\nconfidence, insecurity, stress, isolation, frustration and anger\u201d (: 2).\nSuch difficulties can  directly  influence  the  academic  performance  of  students  (Sawir,\n2005) as well as their social acclimatisation within  their  new  peer  group  (Wong,  2004;\nBurns,  1991).  Therefore,  as  the  majority  of   MSc   students   enrolled   on   the   MSc\nprogrammes are international  students,  or  perhaps  have  no  industry  experience,  the\nintensely short timeframe for securing placements and the intense level of work  required\nto do so, was felt to hold potentially detrimental consequences.  Furthermore,  the  timing\nof this module would require students to work over Spring break and submit assignments\non their return, thus placing insurmountable pressure on  students  to  not  only  complete\nassignments, but also study for exams as well as ensuring  a  successful  transition  from\nindustry back into the university environment.\nIntroducing an \u2018Informal\u2019, Optional Placement Opportunity\nThe final option to be discarded was providing students with an \u201coptional extra\u201d short and\ninformal placement with no credit-bearing modular structure that would take place  during\nthe Spring break. In effect, this would be a form of \u2018work shadowing\u2019. While some authors\n(see Herr & Watts,  1988;  Simkins  et  al,  2009)  realise  the  merits  of  such  potentially\nfleeting industry engagement, the  informal  nature  of  work  shadowing  where  students\nobserve role(s) and associated practices  and  procedures  within  an  organisation,  may\ndirectly limit the potential gain for students. Indeed, the informal of  work  shadowing  was\nnot felt to reflect the objectives of this initiative. Thus, to maximise  the  benefits  of  direct\nindustry connection and achieve a \u2018value-added\u2019 experience (see Guile & Griffiths,  2001;\nOrrell,  2004;  Smith  &  Betts,  2000),  the  initiative  would  not  only  require   a   deeper\nimmersion into the industry environment, but a  formal  structure  with  clear  assessment\nand credit-bearing  status  in  order  to  enhance  the  learning  value  of  the  experience.\nTherefore,  where  students  were  interested  in  engaging  in  such  \u2018work-shadowing\u2019,  it\nwould not be an integrated element of their degree, but rather they would be supported in\ntheir search for such experience.\nTOWARDS A MODEL FOR APPLIED DISSERTATIONS\nRetaining the key benefits of the developments outlined above,  the  final  model  of  ADs\nprovides students an alternative to studying for a \u2018traditional\u2019 dissertation as they apply to\ncomplete their MSc dissertation via  an  industry-led  and  devised  research  project  that\nhighlights areas of current concern to  industry.  In  line  with  the  traditional  dissertation,\nADs are set firmly within a clear theoretical framework and explore an issue  in-depth  by:\nusing an inductive approach, developing and testing a hypothesis or evaluating a  theory.\nStudents are required to provide critical analysis, synthesis, interpretation and application\nof theory in an applied environment. Research is conducted through the use  of  a  single\ncase-study approach and students are required to engage in primary data collection  that\nis conducted by spending approximately 1 or 2 days a week with  their  industry  provider\nover the course of an 8-week period.\nWhile ADs are  designed  to  mirror  the  requirements  of  Traditional  Dissertations  (see\nFigure 1), the optional nature of this mode of study and the role of  industry  providers  as\ninitially devising the research project, requires students to \u2018apply\u2019 for a limited  number  of\nindustry-led AD projects. Thus, several differences arise. First, the process of  application\nfor ADs begins in semester one. Students can submit up  to  two  applications  (complete\nwith CVs  and  covering  letters)  by  late  November.  Applications  are  then  short-listed\nbefore final selections are made by industry-providers and the outcomes are shared  with\nstudents in semester 2. Students are also required to submit  both  an  AD  proposal  and\ntraditional dissertation proposal in semester two,  thus  ensuring  if  unsuccessful  in  their\napplication, the administrative process  for  traditional  dissertations  remains  unaffected.\nNevertheless  reflecting  upon  experiences  of  acclimatisation  (Tucker  &   Ang,   2007),\nstudents expressed reservations with the application  beginning  in  semester  one:  \u201chow\ncan I propose myself to an employer if I don\u2019t know what I am going to  do,  I  don\u2019t  know\nwhat  I  am  good  at.  I  wouldn\u2019t  feel  comfortable...if  I  think  of  me  in  December,   no\nway\u201d (Mary). Brenda supported this concern as: \u201cmaybe (students)  would  like  to  attend\nbut it\u2019s too early. They haven\u2019t learned something  about  tourism\u201d.  Such  concerns  were\nhowever quelled as students realised that  variety  and  choice  are  integral  elements  to\ntheir application and up to two applications can be submitted  with  no  restriction  on  the\ntopic(s) chosen. Concerns were further alleviated as students reflected on their  ability  to\nidentify their strengths through the modules they had studied to date: \u201cI think it\u2019s still good\nbecause you could use your elective modules to\u2026cater to what you are researching  and\nthen use the assignments\u2026to\u2026do  some  background  work\u201d  (Tanya).  From  this  point,\nADs follow the same timeline as traditional dissertations as students begin  meeting  with\nsupervisors  in  mid-April,  conduct  fieldwork\/analysis\/write  up  findings  during  June   to\nAugust and submit their dissertations in late August\/early September.\nGiven these differences, several steps  have  been  incorporated  to  familiarise  students\nwith ADs. A dissertation ideas session is held midway  through  semester  one.  ADs  are\nintroduced at this point and students are provided with an AD handbook that  contains  all\nthe key information as well as the required forms (e.g. AD proposal form,  responsibilities\nof student form, document of agreement, etc)  and  pre-approved  research  projects  are\npresented. An online learning  environment  also  ensures  students  have  access  to  all\ndocumentation regarding ADs as well as support  for  writing  CVs  and  covering  letters.\nFurthermore,  students  are  also  able  to  use  the  online  discussion   forums   to   raise\nquestions or request clarification of any aspect of the initiative (see Figure 2  for  example\nof pages on the University\u2019s online learning environment).\n[pic]\nFigure 1: Applied Dissertation Timeline\n[pic]\nFigure 2: Examples of ULearn online support for students\nCONCEPTUALISING LEARNING THROUGH APPLIED DISSERTATIONS\nAttention now turns to conceptualising ADs and  outlining  the  opportunities  afforded  by\nintroducing ADs into MSc programmes. While the fields of science and technology exhibit\nsimilar forms of learning, there remains a distinct lack of supporting pedagogic  research.\nThus to facilitate the development  of  a  conceptual  framework,  the  paper  draws  upon\nliterature  from  work-based  learning  in  higher  education  and  learning  as  a   complex\nadaptive system.\nLearning Through And For Work\n\u201cThere needs to be no mystique about work-based  learning;  the  propositions  on\nwhich it rests are simple enough \u2013 that  effective  learning  can  take  place  at  the\nworkplace, and not only in the formal academic setting of the  lecture  theatre  and\nthe  laboratory,  and  that   we   learn   through   the   experience   of   work   itself\u201d\n(Duckenfield & Stirner, 1992: 4).\nIt is from this philosophy that the need to develop an opportunity  for  direct  postgraduate\nengagement with industry arose. By adopting a framework  directly  influenced  by  work-\nbased learning, students are offered the opportunity to engage in  learning  through  work\nor indeed learning for work (Gray,  2001).  Thus,  students  engage  in  a  mechanism  for\nlearning that develops  current  learning  strategies  through  the  effective  application  of\nclassroom-based knowledge and learning as by engaging directly with industry  \u201clearning\nis being made more effective\u201d (Duckenfield & Stirner, 1992: 6). As Gray (2001) suggests,\nwork-based learning facilitates an environment within which  learning  arises  from  action\nand problem solving, thus in ADs, learning arises as students engage with  \u2018live\u2019  projects\ncurrently facing industry.\nAs   Kemple,   Poglinco   &   Snipes   (1999)   suggest,   partnerships   through    industry\nengagement  can  influence  career  awareness.  Brodie  &  Irving  (2007)  recognise  the\nopportunity to develop employability skills through learning in the work  environment  and\nacknowledge that:\n\u201cthe skills and abilities needed on graduation by today\u2019s students are the same  as\nthose of employees already in the workplace, who seek to  manage  and  adapt  to\nchange and the demands of the complex employment situations\u201d(: 12).\nWhile  ADs  do  not  offer  the  prolonged  immersion  of  work-based  learning,   students\nrecognise the opportunity they provide for professional development.  As  Tanya  said,  \u201cI\nthink it will be good to lead you into a fulltime career\u2026it will enhance  your  CV  as  actual\nexperience as opposed to just doing the research\u201d. All students expressed the difficulty in\ngaining experience of working in the tourism industry and envisaged ADs  would  provide\nthe valuable link with industry that would enhance this aspect of their CV:\n\u201cthe problem I am facing now is that I have to start somewhere\u2026so  it  could  be  a\ngood way to have\u2026.a valuable working experience to start  the  career  you  really\nwant\u201d\u2026 \u201cit\u2019s a starting point to create your professional figure\u201d\u2026\u201cit helps you  build\nyour professional figure in terms of, OK I am coming out of university, what am I? I\nam a tourist developer? How can I prove it? I mean it is just written on a paper and\nnobody knows\u201d (Mary).\nThis  was  particularly  felt  by  international  students,  who  identified  strongly  with   the\nopportunity to  obtain  overseas  experience  of  working  that  facilitate  their  future  \u201cself\npromotion\u201d (Martin) as:\n\u201cI  mean  experience  of  working  in  foreign  countries\u2026will  bring   you   previous\nexperience when you come back to your own country. It is something  special  and\nthe employer will find you are better than the other guys\u201d (Martin).\nSuch  professional  development  also  related  to  students\u2019  identity  and  experience  as\nresearchers as many echoed Mary\u2019s comments that \u201cto do the job they are asking  for  to\nfind a solution to that problem, but some kind  of  research  besides  that  will  help  us  to\ndevelop  our  research  skills  and  problem  solving\u201d.  Such  reaffirmation  of  experiential\nlearning therefore mobilises the potential for  students  to  reinforce  what  Hyland  (1996)\nrefers to as the \u201cethical bases of professional practice\u201d (: 168). Engaging directly with  the\n\u2018real\u2019  concerns  and  issues  facing  industry  can  serve  to  further   stimulate   students\u2019\nmotivation  for value-based professional development. As Martin commented:\n\u201cif we do pick a topic for our research (traditional dissertation), it\u2019s  just  not  a  real\none\u2026we don\u2019t know  if  it\u2019s  useful  in  reality  and  sometimes  I  will  feel\u2026lack  of\nmotivation. Yeah, if you can deal with some problems in a company it is different\u201d\nIt is through \u201cexperiential\u201d learning and the application of theory in  a  \u2018real\u2019  situation  that\nenables  not  only  theory  to  inform  practice,  but  also  practice  to  inform  theory  as  it\nemerges through the integration of (research) work and study (Trigwell & Reid, 1998). As\nlearning is acquired in the midst of practice (Raelin, 1998), the potential  effectiveness  of\nsuch applied learning as outlined by Gray  (2001)  and  Duckenfield  &  Stirner  (1992)  is\nfurther evident as Tanya echoed such opinion  in  that:  \u201cif  you  are  actually  working  for\nsomeone  then  its  going  to  give  you  more  structure  and  probably  finish  with  better\nresearch than if you were doing it and it was going to be on  the  library  shelf\u201d.  Jane  too\nrealised the benefits as she commented: \u201cI think it is a good opportunity  for  us  to  apply\nwhat we have learnt into practice and\u2026make contact with the  local  people  (industry)  in\nthe process\u201d. Such notions of students becoming empowered  within  their  learning  also\nemerges as some expressed that they would be able to  make  a  difference  by  studying\nfor an AD: \u201cthe only thing is that I know at the end of the summer that is what is  going  to\nhappen to it, it will go on the shelf and maybe someone will use it next year as  reference\nlist but other than that there\u2019s really no purpose of it other than for myself\u2026I wish it  could\nbe used for something more, that\u2019s why doing an applied placement  dissertation\u2026would\nbe beneficial\u201d (Tanya). Likewise, Mary felt that: \u201cIf I could write  something  that  could  be\nuseful for somebody else, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s self-esteem\u201d.\nLearning through Partnerships\nMoving beyond the classroom-based environment  demands  the  direct  incorporation  of\nexternal agents and knowledges into the learning environment. Thus, due to the industry-\nled  nature  of  ADs,  learning  becomes  \u201cthe  creation  of  knowledge  as  a  shared  and\ncollective activity, one in which people discuss ideas and share problems  and  solutions\u201d\n(Gray, 2001: 10). Learning  emerges  through  a  series  of  dynamic,  fluid  and  complex\ninterrelations and \u201cthe group and people that are a part of it are  a  system  because  they\nconsist of a set of connected or interdependent people and things\u201d (Mennin,  2007:  306).\nAs such, the framework and practices of ADs emerges as a complex adaptive system  as\nresearching a \u2018real life\u2019 industry problem demands a multiplicity of issues  are  addressed\nsimultaneously. Thus, dissertation research moves  towards  an  adaptive  paradigm  and\nmode  of  study  that  is  no  longer  self-contained   as   is   often   evident   in   traditional\ndissertations.  Rather,  research  emerges  through   complex,   active   inter-negotiations\nbetween  all  parties  (students,  academic  supervisors  and   industry   providers),   each\nholding individual interests and demands from the research. \nAs such, a fundamental element of this mode of study is that students are empowered  to\nbring  their  own  ideas  and  insights  to  the  research  process.  Indeed,  while   industry\nproviders initially devise research projects to reflect an  issue  they  are  currently  facing,\nthroughout the  course  of  the  research  students  become  increasingly  equal  partners\n(Smith & Betts,  2000)  alongside  the  supervisor  and  AD  provider.  Such  partnerships\ndemand flexibility in learning as students become increasingly empowered,  creative  and\nadaptive in their responses  and  actions.  Thus,  learning  arises  through  proaction  and\nreaction as it is constantly changing  and  updated  through  negotiation  (Smith  &  Betts,\n2000). Opportunity therefore exists for student creativity and influence within the direction\nof  research,  the  theoretical  framework  within  which   research   is   situated   and   the\nmethodology adopted as industry partners relinquish absolute control over the  aims  and\nobjectives of the project and encourage students to negotiate  alternative  and  previously\nhidden  research  pathways.  Thus,  they  adopt  the  roles  of  mentors,   facilitators   and\ngatekeepers to avenues  of  primary  data  collection.  Such  innovative  opportunities  for\nlearning were recognised by the students as:\n\u201cmaybe they will also be interested in finding innovative solutions\u2026taking things in\nanother direction\u201d...\u201c(dissertation is) a moment where you are, we are putting  your\nideas  and  you  have  the  freedom  to  do  that  so  you  can  try  to  find  different\nperspectives, solutions and so on. You have not just to give  practical  advice.  Ok,\nyes this problem is usually solved this way, so I cannot avoid to do that and this  is\nmy topic, this is my dissertation\u2026.but please leave me that freedom\u201d (Mary).\nSuch thoughts were echoed by Tanya as:\n\u201cI am here for my academic (degree), not to do their  work,  so  they  have  to  give\nand take and I wouldn\u2019t want to work for someone who wasn\u2019t interested  because\nthis is a Masters dissertation not free labour\u2026I think there\u2019s a fine line\u201d.\nTherefore the flexibility and freedom to exercise  intellectual  creativity  was  important  to\nstudents. Such negotiation is reflected in  the  AD  framework  as  students  are  provided\nwith only a research outline and are encouraged  by  industry  providers  to  fine-tune  the\nproject  specifications  as  well  as  construct  their  own  methodological   framework   for\nrealising project aims and objectives.\nAll parties therefore  become  \u201csemi-autonomous  agents\u201d  (Dooley,  1996)  each  holding\ntheir own interpretation of reality. As MacDaniel & Driebe (2001) suggest:\n\u201cagents are different form each other, have different histories and the capability  of\nexchanging information with each other, themselves and their  environment.  Each\nagent  has  different  information  about  their  system   and   none   have   enough\ninformation to understand the system in its entirety\u201d.\nAs such ADs become a complex  negotiation  and  sharing  of  knowledge.  They  are  an\nactive performance of learning  within  which  parties  exchange  information,  knowledge\nand expectations. Learning emerges via  interaction  within  the  complex  landscapes  of\nagents. Such landscapes  of  applied  learning  therefore  not  only  reflect  the  individual\nneeds, wants and expectations  of  agents,  but  also  produce  collective  landscapes  as\nagents come together  within  the  learning  environment.  Such  collectiveness  emerges\nbetween students and supervisors, students  and  industry  providers,  industry  providers\nand supervisors as well as a fusion of all three in a nonlinear fashion (Dooley, 1991).\nHowever,   the   complexity   of   such   relations   requires   clarity   on   the    roles    and\nresponsibilities of each party. Research aims  and  objectives  are  initially  presented  by\nindustry providers within the  research  proposal  and  through  the  dynamic  triangulated\ncommunication between student, academic supervisor and industry  provider,  these  are\nmoulded as each party contributes to the development of the  project  via  their  individual\nexpert knowledges, reflections  and  experience  (see  Figure  4).  However,  while  work-\nbased learning often agrees \u201ca learning contract or agreement with describes  \u2018outcomes\u2019\nin terms of learning objectives\u201d (Duckenfield & Stirner, 1992: 5), for ADs,  agreements  on\noutcomes   are   supplemented   with   a   document   of   agreement   that   outlines   the\nresponsibilities of each party as well as a \u201cresponsibilities of  the  student\u201d  document.  By\ndeveloping formalised relations between parties,  ADs  move  away  from  the  traditional,\nstructured  approach  to  learning  of  traditional  dissertations  as  semi-isolated  learning\nenvironments and embrace the complexities of multiple agent engagement. Akin to work-\nbased learning, students therefore become partially integrated into industry as they adopt\na \u2018consultancy\u2019-style approach to learning. Indeed,  unlike  work-based  learning  ADs  do\nnot involve a period of full-time (paid or unpaid) employment for a range of timeframes up\nto  one  year.  Rather,  students  work  on  a  voluntary,  unpaid  research  project  and  in\nadopting a pseudo-consultancy role, they are granted access to data and  spend  time  in\nthe organisation for up to two or three days a week over a period of up to eight weeks.\n[pic]\nFigure 4: The Dynamic Triangulation of Learning\nAdapting Through Reflexivity\nFinally,  ADs  further  echo  the  principles  of  work-based  learning  as  they   encourage\nstudents to become reflexive practitioners and offer the scope for the  acquisition  of  new\nknowledge that encourages students to learn to  learn  (Gray,  2001).  Such  reflexivity  in\nlearning facilitates not only academic maturity  but  directly  impacts  on  the  professional\nand personal development of students. The challenges of learning  through  partnerships\nand the complexities of learning require students to reflect upon  not  only  the  academic\ndemands of their work, but the emotional, social, cultural, political and historical  contexts\nwithin  which  actions  and   behaviours,   reactions   and   responses   are   realised.   As\nDuckenfield & Stirner (1992) suggest opportunities arise for:\n\u201cpractical  application  of  knowledge  and  the  development  of  operational  skills,\npersonal  development  in  terms  of  greater  confidence  and  maturity,   a   better\nunderstanding of business, improved communication and interpersonal skills,  and\nintellectual development through the sharpening of analytical abilities\u201d.\nWhile students studying for ADs  do  not  experience  the  same  prolonged  exposure  to\nindustry practice as students on placements, the structure of their research, the  intensity\nof  data  collection  combined  with  the  demands  of  ensuring  effective  communication\nbetween parties and the successful completion  of  the  research  according  to  research\nobjectives requires they develop as independent  learners.  As  such,  they  can  become\nreflexive learners. Indeed, while not an employee of the organisation,  in  working  closely\nwith the industry provider within both  the  university  and  industry  setting,  students  are\nexposed to the everyday practices of their chosen  industry  environment.  Thus,  working\nwithin  a  complex  adaptive  system,  it   is   essential   students   develop   not   only   as\nindependent academic researchers, but as team players and  project  managers  as  they\nbecome responsible for the successful completion of an industry \u2018consultancy\u2019 project.\nCONCLUSIONS & REFLECTIONS ON AD IN PRACTICE\nThis paper has outlined the development of ADs as a mode of study that facilitates  direct\nindustry engagement for taught postgraduate students. From initial conception as a  one-\nyear placement, an elective module or an \u201cinformal\u201d pseudo work-shadowing opportunity,\nthe AD initiative has been established as an innovative pathway that brings students,  AD\nproviders and academic supervisors together in a dynamic triangulation of learning.\nOverall, the introduction of ADs has been  strongly  and  positively  received  by  industry,\nstaff and students alike. It is felt that this initiative will continue to provide students with  a\nvalue-added  experience  that  directly  contributes  to  their  professional   and   personal\ndevelopment throughout the course of their  MSc  programme.  Indeed,  the  demand  for\nADs has increased year on  year  with  over  25  successfully  completed  or  in  progress\nthrough this initiative. As can be seen from the following student responses, it  is  proving\nsuccessful not only  for  students,  but  also  for  the  industry  partners  who  provide  the\nresearch opportunities. As Maggie reflected on her experience:\n\u201cone of my most unforgettable experiences at Surrey was the Applied Dissertation.\nI worked with Forest Research, the research agency of the  Forestry  Commission,\nwith  the  support   of   the   local   forest   management   team,   to   evaluate   the\neffectiveness of visitor management practice son woodland heritage trails.  In  this\nproject,  I  was  able  to  combine  my  academic  knowledge  with   real   industrial\nsituations, and further developed my applied skills in tourism marketing research\u201d.\nLikewise,  Rachel  shared  her  experiences   of   working   with   The   Adventure   Travel\nCompany:\n\u201cThe main focus was on determining The  Adventure  Company\u2019s  achievement  in\nputting  responsible  tourism  into  action;  and  subsequently  testing   its   existing\nconsumers responses to company\u2019s performances. The project involved  using  an\ninternet questionnaire to collect numerous relevant  samples  for  demonstrating  a\nwider population. Results were compared  with  previous  empirical  research  and\nthe company\u2019s current responsible performances. The findings were to be used  in\nthe   company\u2019s   future   developments   for   implementing   responsible   tourism\napproaches as well as for its distribution to the entire industry in this field from  the\nmarket\u2019s perspective. It was  a  great  experience  to  combine  academic  theories\nwith real industrial situations\u201d.\nThe range of AD opportunities offered to students has continually increased, with over 21\nprojects offered from 9 industry providers for the academic year  2009-10.  The  research\nprojects offered continue to reflect  the  range  of  challenges  facing  industry  and  cover\nareas such as: product development, tourism  contributions  to  the  local  economy,  and\nharnessing opportunities of the 2012 Olympics for local SME\u2019s to name but a few.\nTherefore, while realising a pedagogical gap, the paper has  drawn  upon  literature  from\nwork-based learning and learning  as  emerging  through  complex  adaptive  systems  in\norder to conceptualise the learning and teaching environment within which  this  mode  of\nstudy can be situated. In doing so, three main conclusions can be drawn from the  paper.\nFirst, ADs offer  students  the  opportunity  to  learn  through  and  for  work.  In  providing\nstudents the opportunity to work  directly  with  industry,  students  are  able  to  reap  the\nbenefits of applied, effective  learning.  Such  development  arises  as  students  heighten\ntheir  awareness  of  their  future  career  path;  realising   the   opportunities   for   further\nestablishing and asserting their  professional  identity  and  mobilising  an  \u2018edge\u2019  in  \u201cself\npromotion\u201d  (Martin).  Furthermore,  it  was  felt   that   experiential   learning   opens   the\npossibility for enhancing students\u2019 professionalism as they engage in \u2018real  life\u2019  situations\nand become empowered within their learning. Secondly, the  paper  positions  ADs  as  a\nmode of study that elevates learning through partnerships. Becoming situated  as  agents\nin a knowledge generating system, students learn to  adapt  and  cope  as  their  learning\nenvironment and knowledge generation changes and evolves. The research environment\nas based in industry, becomes infiltrated  with  numerous  agents,  issues  and  problems\nthat demands students become adaptive and flexible. As Railsback  (2001)  suggests,  in\nsuch systems there are varying  degrees  of  randomness  and  deterministic  chaos  and\nresearch  will  develop  through,  and  in  response  to,  the  emergence   of   stimuli   and\nobservations.  Thus,  learning  emerges  through   a   dynamic   triangulation   of   agents\n(student, supervisor and AD provider), that serves not to suppress  students\u2019  voices,  but\nrather provides opportunity for student creativity and innovation as they directly  influence\nthe direction of research by working in  partnership.  Research  therefore  emerges  as  a\nseries of negotiations and knowledge sharing  practices  that  reflect  both  the  individual\nwants  and  needs  of  agents,  but  also  produce  collective  landscapes   of   knowledge\nproduction. Finally,  the  paper  proposes  that  ADs  open  further  pathways  to  develop\nstudent  reflexivity.  Such  reflexivity  facilitates  not  only  academic   maturity,   but   also\nmobilises the professional and personal development of the individual as they develop as\nactive agents of their own learning.\nREFERENCES (with CrossRef Systems Check)\nBoud, D. & Symes, C.
