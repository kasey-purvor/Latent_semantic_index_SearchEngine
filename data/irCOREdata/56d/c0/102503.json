Most of these scientific \ndisciplines look at situations from a specific perspective and almost all of the authors use the \nconcept 'situation' in its natural language meaning without formulating precise definitions. \n \nAccording to 'Chambers English Dictionary' and 'The Oxford English Dictionary', Situation is \na particular relation between the individual (his\/her role, position, location, status) and the \nexternal to his\/her circumstances (conditions, surrounding, relationships with the \nenvironment) at a particular time (critical point, coincidence) in reality. According to this \ninterpretation, situations are defined through the concepts individuals, surroundings, relations \nand time. The dynamic aspect of this complex relationship is introduced not only by the time \ndimension, but also by the involvement of other agents and institutions as mediators. For work \nsituations these mediators are the organisation and the management system, and their dynamics \nis visualised in Figure 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n1\n In: Leadership & Organisation Development Journal, vol. 18, 2, 1997, pp. 99-107. \n \nENVIRONMENT\nORGANISATION\nINDIVIDUAL\nMANAGEMENT\nFigure 1. General model of  the organisational system\n  \n \n 2 \nThe dynamics of work situations as ever-changing organisation, management, environment and \npeople have challenged social sciences since Taylor. However, the fragmentation of the system \nhas led to the development of numerous theories, approaches, models and explanatory \nframeworks. This selective fragmentation has already proved unable to grasp the complexity of \nchanges not only in practical but in theoretical terms as well. \n \nMost of the organisational theories have focused on the relationship \u2018individual - environment\u2019 \nand the behavioural effect from the influence of \u2018objective stimulus\u2019, presented as situational \nfactors. The reverse effect that the behaviour has upon the objective stimulus forms an under-\nresearched area. \n \nWe approached the argument \u2018determinism vs. choice\u2019 from an alternative perspective - a \nsynthesis of determinism and choice, of system thinking and action thinking in dealing with \norganised social entities.  \n \nThe deterministic orientation is well represented in the Systems approach. However, the \ncategories that are used in research are at different levels of abstraction and usually describe a \ndiverse set of relationships. The research has evolved mainly by including new categories as \nmore significant and replacing others - as non-relevant. \n \nThe leading theoretical models based on system thinking are: the Aston systemic model (Pugh \nand Hickson, 1976); the universalistic approach in management (Ritchie, 1993); the technical \nperspective; the critical perspective; and the technological perspective. (Reed, 1989) \n \nThe Action approach in contrast, as representing the choice perspective in organisation theory, \nattempts to look at the dynamic changes in the relationships between individual, organisation, \nmanagement and environment. The leading models based on action thinking are: the population \n- ecology  model; the institutional model; the resource dependence model; the political \nperspective. The Action approach is characterised by application of a relativistic logic. The \ncontinuous processes of adaptation, re-negotiation and institutionalisation of practices are \nanalysed including the reverse effect of the actions of individuals, determining their \nsurroundings. (For more detailed discussion of the theoretical perspectives, based on system \nand action thinking, see Todeva, 1994.)  \n \nTheoretical model for situational analysis \nThe aim of this theoretical model is to provide more detailed elaboration of the organisational \nsystem and to integrate the deterministic approaches, based on system thinking with the \nrelativistic perspectives within the action approach. \n \nThe model for situational analysis conceptualises work organisations in two ways. First it is \nconstructed in blocks of factors that determine the relationship between the individual and the \nsurroundings. The blocks are organised in four groups according to the level of abstraction and \ngeneralisability - individual behaviour, management system, organisation and environment \n(Fig. 2.).  \n \n  \n \n 3 \nSecond, the situational factors are described through their particular characteristics (measures, \nindicators) with emphasis on the process of interaction between dependent and independent \nvariables (Fig. 3.). \nAll characteristics of the organisation, the management and the individual are treated as \nobjective factors determining the social processes. Each of these factors is viewed \nsimultaneously as an independent variable (cause), and a dependent variable (effect). This \nmulti-variance and reversibility of the effect appears as a major characteristic of the interaction \nbetween the acting individuals and their environment, in result of which any particular situation \nis generated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe four levels of analysis represent four different ways of reviewing the problems that may \noccur in a situation. The organisational system itself, presented in the three circles in Fig. 1 and \n2., is discussed in details in this paper. It comprises of the three levels of analysis - individual, \nmanagement and organisation. The most abstract level of analysis of organisational problems is \nORGANISATION\nMANAGEMENT\nINDIVIDUAL\nENVIRONM ENT\n2.G.\nProduct\nof  work\nSocial Relations\n2.F. 2.E.\nConditions of\nwork\n2.D.\nContent\nof work\nPersonnel\n2.C.\nManagement2.B.\n2A.\nTechno-\nlogy\n3.B Satisfaction\n3.A.\nMoti-\nv ation\n3.C.\nBeha-\nv iour\n3.D\nPersonality\nStructure\n1.A.\nContext\nPower & Control\nStrategy\n1.C.1.D.\n1.B.\n4.C.

It is presented in the intermediate circle and includes \nTechnology, Management, Personnel, Conditions of Work, Social Relations and Product of \nWork (blocks 2.A. - 2.G.). \n \nThe third level of abstraction includes details of the individual performance and response to the \noverall situation (blocks 3.A. - 3.D.). The forth level summarises the general characteristics of \nthe environment determining the contingency options of an organisation and the accumulated \neffect of organisational activities (blocks 4.A., 4.B. and 4.C.). Figure 3. is a detailed elaboration \non the characteristics of work situation from Fig. 2. \n \n1. Characteristics of the organisation \nThe general organisational characteristics usually are studied on the basis of an expert \nassessment. Within this model they are discussed both as independent variables (or situational \nfactors) and dependent variables, influenced by the activities at management level and by the \nspecific environmental conditions. \n \n1.A. Organisational structure (Fig. 3.) is characterised by the size, specialisation, integration, \nconfiguration of positions, information flow and location. \n \nThe division of functions among the departmental sub-structures in the organisation and their \nspecialisation characterises the way organisation's activities are structured. (Pugh & Hickson, \n1976; Pugh, 1988; Organisational Behaviour and Industrial Psychology, 1979). \n \nAs a whole the organisational structure is characterised also by the configuration of positions or \nthe degree of correspondence between the established structure and the type of production \ntechnology. (Woodward  In: Pugh, 1988) \n \nThe location of various sites also determines the configuration of positions in the organisation. \n(Pugh & Hickson, 1976) \n \nAn additional characteristic of the structure is the stability of configuration of positions. \nIntensive changes lead to instability of all processes in the organisational and the management \nblock. \n \nIn regard to the communication system, two essential characteristics are specified: information \nsupply (i.e. the structure of information channels and the continuity of information flow - \nArnold, 1988) and the nature of the information itself or the degree of formality. \n \n1.B. Organisation's strategy (Fig. 3.) is defined as the \"long-term aims and goals concerning \nthe main trends of action and development of the organisation and the distribution of means and \nresources in it\". (Chandler in: Pugh, 1988) Strategy is characterised not only by the defined set \nof objectives, but also by the actual performance of the organisation, its efficiency and flexibility \nfor change.  \n  \n \n 5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe performance level, according to Dawson, is measured through the following categories: \nsales volume, total assets, working capital, productivity; profitability; stock-market \nperformance. (Dawson, 1993) For this model, the profitability is taken as an integral \nENVIRONMENT\nORGANISATION\nMANAGEMENT\nINDIVIDUALS\n3.D.

Model for situational analysis\n  \n \n 6 \nassessment of the organisational performance, and the sales volume is considered as an integral \nevaluation and a characteristic of the final product (discussed in block eight). \n \nOne of the most controversial characteristics of the organisations is their efficiency. Klein \nquotes eight determining indices in respect to efficiency, including both economic and social \ncriteria, i.e. profit, growth, resource utilisation, level of flexibility, innovative capacities, \nproductivity, satisfaction of the clients, satisfaction of the workers. (Klein & Ritti, 1984) \n \nThe nature of the organisational change is another situational  characteristic of the \norganisation. (Chandler in: Pugh, 1988). It is a measure of the flexibility of the organisation and \nmay vary from 'strategy driven' to 'problem driven'. \n \n1.C. The power in an organisation itself is defined as the \u201cright to make decisions and give \ninstructions\u201d. (Arnold, 1988) It has a structure of its own, which depends on the formal division \nof responsibilities and is characterised by concentration at certain levels and in certain groups \nof individuals. \n \nThe power within organisation has another feature - succession - i.e. the way in which \nmanagement rights are obtained. This characteristic is directly related to the concept of \nownership and may vary in time. \n \nWithin the overall organisational structure, the process of decision-making is characterised with \nthe level of centralisation and decentralisation. (Pugh & Hickson, 1976) \n \nAnother feature of the power and authority system (as independent variable) is the degree of \nstandardisation of operations and links. On one hand, this characteristic is determined by the \nsize and age of the organisation, but on the other, the degree of standardisation itself determines \nthe control system and influences the overall management process, the character and nature of \nwork, the social relations and individual motivation and performance. \n \nAn essential variable of the organisation is its control system measured by the degree of \nformalisation of communications and control. It affects directly the social relations, the \nindividuals' feelings and attitudes, and it is a manifestation of the power and authority relations. \n \nThe dependence on higher ranking institutions is another characteristic influencing all other \nelements on the model (Pugh, 1988). \n \n1.D. Contextual variables are organised in a separate block, as they can only be described but \nnot measured. These are the origin and history of the organisation, its main resources and other \nparent organisations influencing its performance. \n \nThe main theoretical concepts related to organisational structure, strategy, power and control \ncan be further operationalised in a way to measure particular characteristics in a scheme of \ninterval scales. \n \nThe elements of the Management system are presented in blocks 2-8 on Figures 2 and 3. They \ndescribe the factors that mediate the interaction of the individual with the organisational \n  \n \n 7 \nenvironment and form a distinctive level of analysis. The allocation of indicators in separate \nblocks is indicative for the purpose of clarity. \n \n2. Characteristics of management systems \nThis level of analysis comprises of a complex set of indicators that give information about the \nmanagement practices (as dependent variables)  and the key factors which determine the \nworking of the organisation (independent variables with direct impact on management).  \n   \n2.A. Characteristics of technology  \nThe technology in this study is interpreted as a \"totality of skills, knowledge, methods of \noperation and technological equipment\", that transform the object of labour into a product. \n(Flippo, 1978) In this sense technology appears as an outcome of its use by individuals, with \ntheir skills and knowledge; a product of the style of management in terms of the organisational \ninfrastructure and decision making; and a state of the equipment.  \n \nOn the other hand, as independent variable, technology with its particular features - \ncomplexity, automation and others, influences the entire production process and all the other \nelements of the specific work situation - nature and content of work, working conditions, final \nproduct, management style, organisational structure and strategy, social relations, work \nsatisfaction, individual motivation, behaviour and performance (Figure 3.). \n \nThe characteristics of technology, as well as the characteristics of all blocks in the intermediate \ncircle of the model may refer both to the organisation as a whole or to any sub-structure like \ndepartment, branch or sector.  \n \nThe main characteristics of technology within this model include: degree of automation; \ncomplexity of the operations; variability of the technological operations; interdependence of \nthe individual places in the technological process; standardisation; stability\/ predictability of \nthe results; workflow. (Buchanan, 1985; Klein, 1984; Dawson, 1993) (block 2.A., Fig. 3.) \n \nThe integral assessment of organisational technology aims to describe the actual processes and \noperations in their dynamics. \n \n2.B. Characteristics of management structures and processes  \nAt the management level of analysis there is a separate block of general characteristics of the \nmanagement system itself, including the administrative procedures, policies and practices. The \nset of indicators included in this block differ from the organisational characteristics as being \nmore specific and related to the main mechanisms for change. \n \nThe management system is described through two groups of characteristics. The first group \nfocuses upon management structure, including the following characteristics: administrative \nhierarchy; correspondence between the formal structure of subordination (structure of tasks \nand responsibilities) and the informal structure of relationships; character of employment, or \nthe character of the individual labour contracts; involvement of the trade unions in decision \nmaking. \n \n  \n \n 8 \nThe second group of characteristics refers to the process of establishing the necessary \nconditions and prerequisites for production and business activities, which includes all \nmanagement functions and roles. Some of the key characteristics of the management process \nare: the balance between planned and achieved; definition of rules, procedures, norms and \nmethods of work, i.e. the entire formal structure of production tasks, which is based on job \ndescription and work regulation; co-ordination of activities through precise direction of the \nobligations and responsibilities - to achieve unambiguity of professional roles and norms. \n(Kotze, 1980) \n \nMore complex characteristics of the outcomes of management activities are: the degree of co-\nordination of procedures, rules and standards, and the congruence between formal and real \nrequirements (Munsinger, 1978). \n \nThe characteristics of the management process include also the system of control (both \nadministrative and public) with its most essential feature - the intensity of control. \n \nThe system of remuneration is another essential feature of the management system, which is \nportrayed by the following characteristics: evaluation of the criteria for assessment of the \nlabour input (on the basis of comparability of operations and functions); and evaluation of the \nreverse control that the assessed people have over the assessment criteria. (Arnold. H., \nFeldman. D., 1988) \n \nManagement is also characterised by management style, i.e. the balance between management \nof tasks and management of people, between the autocratic and the democratic approach. \n(Munsinger, 1978; Fayol,  In: Kakabadse, 1988) \n \n2.C. Characteristics of the personnel \nThis block includes two types of indicators. The first type consist of variables which \ncharacterise the whole personnel, while the second type focuses upon individually specific \ncharacteristics. Both types of personnel characteristics influence directly social relations at \nwork and are classified by many authors under the framework of group relations. However, we \nbelieve they should be studied separately as the personnel constitute one of the main resources \nin an organisation. \n \nThe first group of indicators evolves from the joint labour activity, from the process of social \nand professional adaptation of individuals and from the specific management decisions. These \ncharacteristics are: size of the working group; homogeneity of professional composition; \nhomogeneity of social attitudes and similarity of views; commonness of goals, including \npersonal objectives and internalisation of corporate objectives; shared values; similar ideas of \nfairness, prescribed code of ethics and standards of behaviour; symbols, stories, rituals. \n(Dawson, 1993) \n \nThe second group of characteristics does not reveal the commonness of the individuals but the \ndifferentiation between them, dividing them into sub-groups. These are the following variables: \nage; education, training, and commitment to a body of knowledge; occupational skill and \nprofessionally significant qualities; social, professional and work experience; social \norigin and relation to external grouping; degree of adaptation. (Dawson, 1993) \n  \n \n 9 \n \nThe assessment of the personnel on these indicators allows to identify potential conflict, \nopportunity networks and need analysis for organisational development. \n \n2.D. Characteristics of content of work \nThe content of work is significant for the formation of the individual's perceptions of his \/ her \npsychological situation. David Buchanan (1979) presents an extensive scheme of the \nrelationship between human needs and requirements from one\u2019s profession and the particular \nwork content that meets these basic needs. \n \nHowever, the research in this area has concentrated mainly upon the negative factors that \ndevelop dissatisfaction and build up physical fatigue and distress. (Locke, 1984) \n \nThe most recent analysis in this field suggests the following characteristics: variety and \ncomplexity of operations; clarity of tasks; significance of tasks; responsibility and activities \nrequired; independence; degree of control over the processes; feedback information about the \nresults from the efforts; possibilities for creativity; workload; frequency of extreme situations. \n(Arnold and Feldman, 1988; Locke, In: Gruneberg, 1984; Dawson, 1993) \n \nLocke's findings show that employees value and prefer work that corresponds with their \npersonal interests, which is important, give them an opportunity to use their skills and abilities, \nchance to grow, variety of tasks, responsibilities with autonomy in making decisions; which \ninvolves a whole piece of work with definite and visible outcome, which is conceptualised as \ngiving sense of purpose, and on which feedback is received. (Locke, 1984) \n \nFor more precise characteristic of jobs and classification of different professions, corresponding \nto variations in their content, Spenner suggests a modification of the classification system based \non the Dictionary of Occupational Titles of 1970. (Spenner, 1980) According to his view, there \nare three major components relevant to the content of professions: relationship to data; \nrelationship to people; relationship to objects. \n \nAll these characteristics are measurable through interval scales for a more detailed audit of the \ncontent of work in organisations. \n \n2.E. Characteristics of conditions at work \nFor some authors the concept of 'working conditions' includes not only the physical \nenvironment, but also the organisational and technological environment as well as the specific \nproduction process and the economic relations. Such a broad interpretation of the working \nconditions is inappropriate as it would embrace almost all factors in this model into one block. \nFor that reason 'working conditions' are interpreted only as the conditions of the physical \nenvironment. They are characterised by the following: micro-climate, ergonomic \ncharacteristics, communications, factors distracting attention, specific restrictions - including \ncommunication barriers, sensor and muscles deprivation, safety - as an integral assessment of \nthe risk factors, health and sanitary conditions of work. \n \n  \n \n 10 \nThe assessment of the conditions is significant in relation to problems of managing the physical \nresources in a company and the implications on quality of the product and the social relations \nand organisational culture. \n \n2.F. Characteristics of social relations \nThis area of social research is dominated by contradictory results and methods. In the theory of \norganisational behaviour social relations are subdivided into two major groups - relations \nconcerning tasks fulfilment, and interpersonal relations, arising in the course of joint work. \nBoth groups of relations have formal and informal aspects. The formal aspects are characterised \nby the following indicators: definition of the role and status, uniformity \/ ambiguity of roles, \ninterdependence within the work team, supervisor's strategy, conflicts of the employees with \nthe management staff (Pugh, 1988; Etzioni, 1980; Dawson, 1993). \n \nThe informal aspects of interpersonal relations according to Kotze are based on two major \ngroup processes - a process of social comparison and a process of social control.  \n \nThe social comparison is a psychological mechanism used for comparison of abilities, social \nstatus, efforts and rewards, through which the individuals establish their level of demands and \nthe corresponding expectations in order to meet them within the working process. (Kotze, \n1980) It is characterised by: dependency and dominance in goal-setting between different \ngroups; and changes in goals. (Dawson, 1993) \n \nThe process of social control is carried out by the group (team) through the requirement for \nindividual conformity and the mechanism of group cohesion. A review of subsequent studies \nhave shown that the relationship between group performance and cohesion is a complex one \nand depends on the group goal, the task structure and the dispersion of abilities within the \ngroup. (Lott and Lott, 1965) \n \nAccording to the theory of social exchange of Homans, the interaction between the individual \nand the group is conducted through a system of 'payments' and 'rewards'. (Homans, 1961) On \nthe basis of this 'exchange', processes of competition and co-operation arise within the team and \n'referent groups' are formed for any individual. \n \nSome additional characteristics of group relations are: internal group control, run through \ngroup's expectations and norms; psychological compatibility; social support among the \nmembers of the group; informal communication and activities; emotional contacts (agreement \/ \ndisagreement, trust \/ mistrust, mutual understanding, sense of belonging and cohesion). \n \nIn the course of joint work certain stereotypes of work are set up, which affect both the process \nof work and the interpersonal relations and interactions. \n \nA review of the social relations at work following the indicators in the model is important to \nhighlight the adaptability of the social system to change. \n \n2.G. Characteristics of product of work \nEach business activity is characterised with a certain final outputs. For a manufacturing \norganisation the final product of work is characterised by range; degree of product completion; \n  \n \n 11 \nquantity (compared to planned amount); quality; stability of production results. Evaluation of \nthe final output gives a clear indication of the overall efficiency of management and \norganisational performance. \n \n3. Psychological situation \nThe eight blocks at management level of analysis comprise those organisational characteristics \n(or factors) of the work situation that are perceived by the individuals as external to them. \nHowever, they modify the psychological situation of the individuals. Each individual perceives \nthe situation in a different way which constitutes a specific psychological situation. \n \nAll four elements of the psychological situation - personality, motives, actions (or behaviour) \nand satisfaction - form the behavioural level of analysis in this model. The variables at this level \ncan be studied through specialised tests. An evaluation of the way the individuals perceive the \noverall situation at work is significant for every organisational intervention. \n \n3.A. Characteristics of motivation \nThe motivation in this model is conceptualised as a dynamic force, determining the individual \nperformance and behaviour through personal decisions. \n  \nAccording to the expectations theory, the motives are a result of individual's comparison \nbetween the requirements of the work situation and one\u2019s own needs in it; between probable \nrewards and probable losses. \n \nThe individual does not only make a decision on a particular act, but also defines the volume of \nefforts worth making. This choice is conditioned by the following factors:  expected failures or \nlosses; expected rewards; interest to work; drive for professional development; significance of \nthe social results; self-confidence. \n \nThe significance and meaningfulness of the activity is measured by the personal meaning \nattributed by the individual to the elements of the actual situation in the process of their \npsychological perception and reflection. \n \nO' Brien defines two groups of indicators for the volume of individual effort, action and \nperformance: individual characteristics (task perception, level of aspiration, individual \nabilities, personality) and group characteristics (learning, autonomy, social support and \nrecognition, group co-operation, desirable future). (O' Brien, 1984) \n \nThese two sets of variables determine the attitudes to work. Two additional elements have also \nan impact on work attitude: the way the individuals divide the rewards into external and \ninternal rewards; the proportion between reversible and irreversible losses. \n \nIn the process of motivation the individual's life strategy holds a central place. Its power is \nexpressed by the self-confidence and self-determination that each individual articulates. \n \nThe numerous quantitative research on motivation failed to deliver the expected outcomes and \nthe issue of motivation became unpopular in the last few years. However, an understanding of \n  \n \n 12 \nthe individual response to change and organisational transformation is limited without \nassessing these characteristics of the work situation. \n \n3.B. Characteristics of satisfaction \nJob satisfaction is an emotional response. It is a feeling which may, or may not, cause action. \nThe action itself is a choice from a range of alternative options. (Locke, 1984) \n \nModern studies in social psychology divide satisfaction into personal and general. According to \nthe definition of Naumova, personal satisfaction is  measured through the \"equivalent \nexchange of values between the individual on one hand, and the team \/ organisation on the \nother\" and general satisfaction is formed by exchange, based upon group status and group \nnorm. (Naumova, 1988) \n \nAccording to the theory of equivalent exchange the individual gives the organisation his\/her \ntime, efforts, education, experience, skills, abilities and ideas and receives in return material \nremuneration, promotion, recognition, security, fulfilment, personal gains and possibilities for \nsocial contacts and friendship. (Arnold and Feldman, 1988) \n \nLawler argues that satisfaction comes as a result of comparison between what is being received \nin the form of rewards and the individual's idea of what he\/she should have received for his\/her \nefforts. (Lawler, in: Pugh, 1988) Arnold adds that the rewards received are divided into \n'external' and 'internal', and individual's idea of what he\/she should have received is determined \nby his\/her system of values, professional status and concepts of equality and justice. (Arnold \nand Feldman, 1988, p. 93) \n \nExternal or extrinsic rewards for the individual could be: material remuneration; social \nrecognition; additional incentives. (Arnold and Feldman, 1988) \n \nThe internal, or intrinsic rewards are connected with the conditions for creativity and for \nexercising and enlarging personal abilities. This, for example, is Vroom's sense of competence. \n \nIn management theory there are also a number of operationalised definitions of the basic factors \nwhich determine professional satisfaction of the workers: job security; content of work, \n(provides intrinsic motivation); amount of remuneration (provides extrinsic motivation); \npossibilities for promotion (do not provide motivation for everyone); competent and fair \nguidance; adequate professional requirements; recognition of the work done; comfortable, safe \nand pleasant working conditions; psychological compatibility with fellow colleagues. (Flippo \nand Munsinger, 1978; Arnold and Feldman, 1988; Locke, 1984; Dawson, 1993) \n \nAs already mentioned, the emotional response to all elements of the work situation influence \nindividual performance and behaviour. \n \n3.C. Characteristics of individual performance and behaviour  \nThe relation between individual's behaviour and his\/her psychological situation is reversible. \nKey determinants of individual\u2019s behaviour are: motivation, abilities, perception, personality \nand the organisational systems and resources. (Arnold and Feldman, 1988) \n \n  \n \n 13 \nIn practical terms individual behaviour at work is manifested by the conscious actions, \nreactions, thoughts, assessments and opinions of the individuals. Three basic orientations of \nbehaviour are revealed in the analysis: task-oriented behaviour; people-oriented behaviour; \nbehaviour oriented to oneself. (Kakabadse, Ludlow, and Vinnicombe, 1988) \n \nThe major mechanisms operating in the formation of the psychological situation and the \nregulation of individual's behaviour are his\/her perceptions and evaluations. As a form of \nadaptation individuals may correct their assessments of their own behaviour. They may correct \nthe 'value' of perceived efforts, or the perception of the results (rewards and losses). Thus, the \nindividuals can change subjectively their psychological situation. (Arnold and Feldman, 1988) \n \nThe individual's behaviour has also its objective dimensions (as independent variables), These \ncharacteristics include: working capacity; professional involvement; conformity of behaviour; \ndirection of efforts (from initiative and constructive involvement to destructive conduct and \naggression); adequacy of one's behaviour (as an estimate of the degree of adaptation to \nparticular professional and personal roles). \n \n3.D. Personality characteristics \nAn evaluation of personality characteristics is possible only through some specialised methods. \nIn situational analysis of work organisation they could be used only to explain the \npsychological situation and the behaviour of individuals. \n \nSome of the main studied variables of personality are the following: inherited nervous and \npsychological features, or unique genetic structure; living resources, including health; age; sex \nand all individual characteristics from block 4; orientation of the personality - as a system of \ndemands, interests, beliefs, values; level of aspirations - as expectations, attitudes; role and \nstatus in the group. (Kotze, 1980; Naumova, 1988; Dawson, 1993)  \n \nWhile the status depends more on the objective characteristics of the individual's position, the \nrole is being determined primarily by the subjective prescriptions of the other members of the \nteam. \n \n4. Characteristics of the environment \nDifferent authors give different definitions of the environment. According to Hofer, the \nenvironmental variables are: market and customer behaviour; industrial structure; competitors; \nsuppliers; organisation's characteristics and resources. (Hofer, 1975) \n \nFor Dawson, the organisational environment consist of: inputs (people, skills, knowledge, raw \nmaterials, components); outputs (goods and services, opportunities, constraints); regulations \n(law, customs, rules, procedures, networks); other organisations, individuals and groups \n(education, government, professional institutions, trade unions, competitors, customers, parent \norganisations). (Dawson, 1993) \n \nFor Anderson and Paine the main environmental variables determining strategic decision are: \ncorporate size; market share; long-run industry growth;  short-run market growth. (Anderson \nand Paine, 1975) \n \n  \n \n 14 \nAccording to Ritchie's model for strategic decisions, the external environment consist of: \neconomic, social, technological, legal, financial, organisation's markets, central and local \ngovernment, interest groups or agencies within the community. (Ritchie, 1993)  \n \nIn this wide diversity of approaches we made an attempt to integrate the elements of the \nenvironment in the following blocks: \n \n4.A. Economic and Market Conditions (ownership, financial market, investments, labour \nmarket, industrial structure and growth, market structure and dynamics, competitors, \nsuppliers, customers etc.). \n4.B. Social System (including education and training, customer and market behaviour, social \nattitudes, values, expectations, co-operation, living conditions, professional networks, \nperceived environmental uncertainty). \n4.C. Political and Legal System (including political organisation and relations, structure of \npower, local and central government, activities of the trade unions and other social and \npolitical organisations, interest groups, agencies, regulations and procedures). \n \nThe characteristics of the environment operate as determinants of the structure, strategy, power \nand context of the organisation, and exert a direct impact on all other elements of the labour \nsituation. \n \nConclusions        \n \nThe model as a whole reveals how complex is organisational research. If the propositions of the \nmodel are accepted, such a research will require an interdisciplinary approach and profound \nunderstanding of the cause-and-effect relationship of different factors and elements of the \nlabour situation.  \n \nOne of the barriers in organisational development practices is the inappropriate interference \nwith complex relationships in business organisations. The organisational transformation \napproach in management consultancy attempts to address this complexity and the proposed \nmodel for situational analysis could be used as a framework and a reference point in evaluating \norganisational problems. \n \nAll levels of analysis in the proposed model contribute to the development of a deep \nunderstanding of the problems and opportunities in organisations which assist directly the \nprocess of planning and evaluating organisational change. The detailed evaluation and analysis \nof the factors in different blocks enables practitioners to avoid mistakes of failed collaboration \nand co-operation of employees, and prevents them from neglecting the environmental pressures \nin organisational development intervention. \n \nThis new approach also enables one to define relationships in new fluid structures and cluster \norganisations. Its application will improve the efficiency of consultancy efforts to identify the \nroots of organisational problems by following the cause and effect line of analysis, and to \ndesign more adequate, complex and integrated frameworks for organisational change and \ntransformation. \n \n  \n \n 15 \nReferences \n \nArnold, H. & Feldman, D.
