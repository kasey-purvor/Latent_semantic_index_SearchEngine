INTRODUCTION\nTHERE is a major effort to develop InAs-based quantum-dot (QD) lasers with better performance than existing\nquantum-well (QW) lasers. More than 20 years ago, the first\ntheoretical prediction showed that using three-dimensional con-\nfined structures with an atomic-like discrete density of states in\nthe active region of semiconductor laser should allow the de-\nvelopment of low threshold current density devices with very\nhigh thermal stability [1], [2]. Since then, a lot of work has\nbeen undertaken to create such lasers and to study their unique\nproperties [3]\u2013[25]. However, despite the growth of very good\nself-assembled layers of QDs, the longer wavelength lasers re-\nquired for optical communications remain temperature sensitive\nat higher temperatures. Fig. 1 summarizes the performance of\nthe best InAs\u2013GaAs-based QD lasers [4]\u2013[19], where we have\nplotted the characteristic temperature, T0, of the threshold cur-\nrent density, Jth, (T0 = Jth(dJth\/dT )\u22121) in the temperature\nrange T = 290\u2013300 K versus Jth at room temperature.

Characteristic temperature, T0, in the temperature range T =\n290\u2013300 K of InAs\u2013GaAs QD lasers with emission wavelengths of \u223c1.3 \u00b5m\n(solid circles) and \u223c1 \u00b5m (open circles) as a function of room temperature\nthreshold current density.\nsults for\u223c1.3- and\u223c1-\u00b5m lasers are shown in Fig. 1 with solid\nand open circles, respectively. The interesting trend observable\nin Fig. 1 is that the higher T0 values are achievable only at higher\nJth values.\nTo explain the temperature sensitivity of the QD lasers, sev-\neral different mechanisms have been proposed in the litera-\nture. Reemission of carriers into the optical confinement lay-\ners (OCLs) activated by increasing temperature and their sub-\nsequent radiative or nonradiative recombination in the OCL\nwas proposed [20], [21]. Indeed, Matthews et al. showed that\nthe temperature sensitivity of short wavelength (\u03bb \u223c 1\u00b5m) QD\nlasers is caused by gain saturation due to the presence of a high\ndensity of states in the wetting layer. The available gain de-\ncreases with increasing temperature and at room temperature\nonly achieves \u223c30% of its maximum [22]. Experimentally, it\nhas also been shown that to decrease the temperature sensitivity\nof Jth, the shape of the QDs should be engineered to maxi-\nmize the energy separation between the ground electron and\nhole states and their respective excited states [23]. Finally, a\nsignificant improvement of T0 has been reached using p-type\ndoping of the QD active region to avoid gain saturation. This in-\ncreased the characteristic temperature up to T0 = 213 K [10]\nand to T0 = 420 K [19] around room temperature, and en-\nabled modulation at 10 Mb\/s up to 70 \u25e6C, albeit at the expense\nof higher Jth values. However, above 60 \u25e6C, T0 decreased to\nonly T0 = 70 K [19]. More recently, a theoretical approach has\nbeen proposed assuming combined statistics for free carriers\n1077-260X\/$20.00 \u00a9 2005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

However, in our previous work, it was shown that the\nthermal sensitivity of Jth in QDs is due to nonradiative recom-\nbination processes, which depend on the band gap of the dots\nand their energy level distribution. The results highlighted the\nlikely importance that Auger recombination can have in 1.3-\u00b5m\nQD lasers [25].\nIn this paper, we extend the study to 1.3-\u00b5m QD lasers with\nvery low threshold current densities (Fig. 1) close to record val-\nues and also show for the first time how the radiative current\ndensity at threshold varies with lasing wavelength brought about\nby the application of hydrostatic pressure. These high-pressure\nresults confirm the existence of significant nonradiative recom-\nbination with the characteristics expected for Auger processes.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe 1.3-\u00b5m QD lasers studied were 10- or 20-\u00b5m-wide\nridge dot-in-a-well structures with five stacked layers of\nInAs QDs within Ga0.85In0.15As QWs separated by 50-nm\nGaAs barriers [26]. The active region was embedded between\n2-\u00b5m Al0.4Ga0.60As cladding layers in a 200-nm GaAs\nwaveguide. The facets were as-cleaved, and the cavity length\nwas 3 mm. Both unamplified spontaneous emission L from a\nwindow milled in the substrate contact and the emission from\nthe laser facet were investigated as functions of the injected\ncurrent at different temperatures. A detailed description of this\ntechnique was given elsewhere [25]. Using the value of the in-\ntegrated spontaneous emission at the threshold current, which\nis proportional to the radiative recombination rate, we were\nable to measure the temperature variation of the radiative part\nof total threshold current density, Jrad. These direct measure-\nments allow us to estimate the relative contribution of radiative\nand nonradiative processes to Jth at different temperatures. The\nlasers were investigated in continuous wave (CW) mode and\nin a pulsed regime. The pulse duration and repetition rate were\n500 ns and 10 kHz, respectively.\nAs an additional tool to study recombination and the loss\nmechanisms responsible for laser performance, we used high\nhydrostatic pressure. This has been previously used to investi-\ngate QW lasers [27], as well as in our previous study of 980-nm\nand 1.3-\u00b5m QD lasers [25]. Applying high pressure allows the\nenergy Elas of the emitted photons to be varied, while keeping\nthe basic properties of the band structure relatively unchanged.\nVarious recombination mechanisms depend on Elas in different\nways. For example, the radiative recombination contribution\nto the laser threshold current ideally increases with pressure as\nE2las in QW lasers [27], whereas the Auger recombination coeffi-\ncient decreases [27], [28]. In conjunction with other techniques,\nthese variations allow one to determine the relative importance\nof these recombination mechanisms. Measurements of the hy-\ndrostatic pressure dependence of Jth, and the lasing photon\nenergy Elas, were carried out at room temperature using a pis-\nton and cylinder apparatus capable of generating pressures up\nto 1.5 GPa [25]. Using a specially designed holder with a laser\nclip, we studied for the first time the pressure dependence of the\nFig. 2.

To avoid internal heating, the high pressure measurements\nwere carried out in the pulsed regime.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nDue to optimized growth [26] and the decreased inhomogene-\nity of the dots, the lasing occured over a relatively narrow spec-\ntral region over the full temperature range investigated (5 meV\nat 100 K and 1 meV at 295 K). A detailed study of the emission\nspectra and mode structure of InAs\u2013GaAs self-assembled QD\nlasers has been presented in [29]. The lasing line corresponded to\nthe ground state emission at all temperatures with a wavelength\nof \u03bb = 1.31 \u00b5m at room temperature, which matches very well\nthe zero dispersion region of standard silica single-mode fiber.\nSpontaneous emission spectra obtained both at lasing thresh-\nold and at a constant current density of 8 A\/cm2, which is always\nbelow Jth, together with facet emission spectra just above Jth\nat different temperatures, are shown in Fig. 2.\nThe temperature dependence of the spontaneous emission\nspectra is similar to that previously observed in 1.3-\u00b5m QD\nlasers and discussed in detail elsewhere [25], [30]. The influ-\nence of the inhomogeneity of the dots was strong at temperatures\nbelow T = 180\u2013200 K and led to the unusual behavior of the\nspontaneous emission spectra, where emission from the higher\nenergy emission peaks decreased with increasing temperature.\nWe observed several emission peaks in the spectra at low tem-\nperature. Their positions at T = 70 K were about 1.033, 1.082,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 5, 2010 at 06:27 from IEEE Xplore.

Taking into account that these bands were observ-\nable in the spectra even at very low current, we ascribed them\nto the ground state emission of dots with different particular\nsizes. However, with increasing current, the emission from the\nexcited state of the bigger dots may also make a contribution that\noverlaps the ground state emission bands of the smaller dots.\nFor instance, it was shown earlier that the energy separation\nbetween the ground state emission of big QDs and small QDs in\nInAs \u201cdot-in-a-well\u201d structures with 2.0\u20132.5 ml of InAs can be\napproximately the same as the difference between the ground\nand first excited state of the large dots [31].\nAs the temperature is lowered below 200 K, thermal reemis-\nsion and transport between the dots is reduced, and the laser\nmust be pumped harder to get the required carrier concentration\nin the ground state of the larger dots. The increased Jth leads to\nan increased emission from the ground state of smaller dots and\nalso from the excited state of bigger dots.\nThe spontaneous emission spectra at constant current showed\nthat the emission of the smaller dots, which was observable at\nlow temperature, almost vanished with increasing temperature\nfrom T = 70 to T = 200 K, whereas the emission intensity\nfrom the ground state of the bigger dots increased by almost by\na factor of 2. Therefore, the total integrated emission intensity\nremained almost constant, showing that there was no significant\nchange in emission efficiency over this temperature range. This\nimplies that nonradiative emission is likely to be small up to\nT = 200 K.\nThe temperature behavior of spontaneous emission spectra is\nalso explained by the fact that with increasing temperature the\ncoupling between the dots improves significantly and carriers\nrecombine radiatively in the bigger dots, leading to the observed\nnarrowing of the spontaneous emission spectra and to a decrease\nof Jth (discussed later). Above T = 200 K, as the threshold\ncurrent increased, an increased emission from the excited state\nof the bigger dots was observed. Nevertheless, transitions from\nthe smaller dots also may contribute to the spontaneous emission\nspectra, especially under higher injected current when lower\nenergy states are filled.\nDue to the increased emission from the excited state above\n200 K, the integrated spontaneous emission at the threshold\ncurrent remained almost constant with temperature as will be\ndiscussed later. However, a decrease of the total emission inten-\nsity at constant current took place above\u223c200 K, demonstrating\na decrease of the internal radiative efficiency. We also observed\nsome emission from the wetting layer in the spontaneous emis-\nsion spectra at threshold at 300 K, albeit very small (the inte-\ngrated area of this region was about 0.7% of the total integrated\nemission). Therefore, we conclude that the decrease of radia-\ntive efficiency must be caused by nonradiative recombination of\ncarriers within the dots.\nThe integrated spontaneous emission L from the window ver-\nsus current at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 3 by the\ndashed lines. The peak intensity of the ground state emission as\na function of injected current, normalized to the value of L at\nthe threshold current at each temperature, is plotted with solid\nlines. The integrated spontaneous emission pins better at higher\ntemperatures. The pinning of the ground state emission is more\nFig. 3. Integrated spontaneous emission (dashed lines) and maximum intensity\nof the ground state peak (solid line) as a function of injected current at T =\n100 K, 220 K, and 300 K. The solid lines show the threshold current at each\ntemperature.\ncomplete than that of the total spontaneous emission at all tem-\nperatures. Above 250 K, the ground state spontaneous emission\npins almost ideally, whereas the total spontaneous emission re-\nmains unpinned. This demonstrates that it is the emission from\nthe excited states that leads to the poor pinning observed for\nthe total integrated emission at high temperatures. In contrast,\nat low temperatures, the inhomogeneous carrier distribution re-\nsults in a lack of pinning for both the total and ground state\nspontaneous emission. The fact that at all temperatures the to-\ntal spontaneous emission pins less well than the ground state\nemission of the larger dots where lasing is occurring shows that\nthermalization to this ground state is being impeded. This could\nbe due to localization of carriers in the smaller dots and\/or due\nto phonon-bottleneck effects within the larger dots.\nIt is interesting to note that the integrated spontaneous emis-\nsion just below threshold is proportional to the injected current\nat low temperature, indicating that the dominant recombination\nprocess is radiative. However, the dependence of L versus I be-\ncomes sublinear with increasing temperature, which shows that\nthe dominant current path has a stronger n dependence than the\nradiative current. This is consistent with the onset of nonradia-\ntive Auger recombination, as has previously been observed in\nQW lasers [32].\nLasers with different ridge widths showed almost the same\nCW threshold current density of 40\u201350 A\/cm2 at T = 295 K,\nwhich is close to the record low values for 1.3-\u00b5m QD lasers\n[33]. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of the threshold\ncurrent density, Jth, and its radiative component, Jrad, mea-\nsured in both the CW and pulse regimes. The characteristic\ntemperatures of Jth measured between 270 K and 300 K were\nT0 = 50\u2013K and T0 = 83 K for CW and pulsed modes, respec-\ntively. The faster increase of the threshold current and its ra-\ndiative component for the CW regime above 270 K is caused\nby internal heating. Because the nonradiative component of the\nthreshold current is decreasing very quickly with decreasing\ntemperature from room temperature down to 200 K, the radia-\ntive current was normalized assuming at Jth it is totally radiative\nbelow 150 K. This assumption is supported by the close fit be-\ntween the observed variations of Jrad and Jth below 150 K.\nBecause Jrad cannot be larger than Jth at low temperature, this\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Threshold current density and its radiative component versus temper-\nature for the 20-\u00b5m ridge device for CW and pulsed measurements.\nassumption sets an upper limit to the value of Jrad, even at high\ntemperature. The decrease in Jth with increasing temperature\nbelow 180 K is often observed in QD lasers and is attributed\nto the enhanced carrier transport between dots with increasing\ntemperature as described previously, which allows carriers to\ncontribute more effectively to the lasing process [25]. Above\n200 K, Jth increases strongly, whereas Jrad remains almost\ntemperature insensitive as originally predicted by Arakawa and\nSakaki [1]. A small increase of Jrad can be explained by the\nfact that QD lasers are much more prone to gain saturation. It\nwas shown earlier that the increasing effect of gain saturation\nwith increasing temperature can lead to an increase of Jrad and\nsometimes to a transition from lasing from the ground state to\nlasing from an excited state [34].\nFrom the Jth and Jrad data shown in Fig. 4, we see that at\nroom temperature Jrad accounts for only\u223c30% to 40% of Jth in\nthese lasers. Therefore, the temperature sensitivity of the lasers\nmust be due to a nonradiative recombination process.\nFor the first time, we measured both the threshold current den-\nsity, Jth, and its radiative part, Jrad, as a function of hydrostatic\npressure. This allowed us to vary the band gap of the structure\nat constant temperature, which gives additional information for\nthe analysis of recombination and loss processes. The pressure\ndependencies of the ground state and excited state transitions\nand lasing photon energy, Elas, are shown in Fig. 5. The lasing\nline and spontaneous emission peaks increase linearly with pres-\nsure with the same gradient of dE\/dP \u223c 65 meV\/GPa. It was\ncalculated earlier that the ground state and the continuum states\n(wetting layer states) have the same pressure variation [25].\nTherefore, if there is some recombination process due to carrier\nescape into the wetting layer, it will not change with pressure.\nThe pressure dependencies of the normalized thresh-\nold current, Jth(P )\/Jth(0), and of the radiative current,\nJrad(P )\/Jrad(0), for the 10-\u00b5m ridge laser are given in Fig. 6.\nJrad was normalized to 30% of Jth at room temperature as\nwe estimated from Fig. 4. The threshold current decreases with\npressure by about 8% to P = 1 GPa. However, the radiative cur-\nrent, measured as the integrated spontaneous emission at Jth,\nFig. 5.

Jrad was normalized to 30% of Jth at atmospheric pressure\nand fitted as a function of the band gap. The solid line is a fit of Jrad, which\ngives Jrad \u223c E6las over this pressure range. The other solid line shows the ideal\nvariation of Jrad for a QW laser with the same gradient dElas\/dP , where it\nis proportional to the square of the lasing photon energy [Elas(p)\/Elas(0)]2.\nThe dashed-dotted line is a fit of the difference (Jth\u2013Jrad) due to Auger re-\ncombination, where JAug \u223c E\u22125.5las .\nstrongly increases with increasing pressure. At P = 0.6 GPa,\nit is \u223c30% larger than Jrad at atmospheric pressure. This in-\ndicates that the dominant recombination mechanism in these\nlow-threshold devices is a nonradiative recombination process,\nwhich is strongly decreasing with increasing pressure. The pres-\nence of a significant nonradiative mechanism is consistent with\nthe temperature dependence of the threshold current as dis-\ncussed previously. Although the exact functional form of the\nvariation of Jrad is unclear at present, from an empirical fit of\nJrad as a power dependence of the band gap or lasing pho-\nton energy, Elas, we find that Jrad increases approximately as\nE6las over this pressure range; thus, we can estimate the band\ngap dependence of the nonradiative component, Jnon-rad, of the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Jnon-rad is also shown in Fig. 6 as a\ndifference between Jth and Jrad. The decrease of Jnon\u2212rad with\npressure is consistent with a decrease in Auger recombination\nwith increasing band gap as seen in QW lasers [27], [28].\nIt is interesting to note that Jrad increases with pressure much\nfaster in QD lasers than predicted for the QW lasers, where\nJrad \u221d E2las [27]. This is a complex subject that requires more\ndetailed investigation that is outside the scope of this paper,\nwhere we take the increase in Jrad with pressure as an experi-\nmental fact.\nThe present results, in which pressure is used to increase\nthe effective band gap of the QD laser, indicate that Auger\nrecombination becomes weaker as the band gap is increased, and\nhence will be relatively insignificant in 980-nm devices, whereas\nthe radiative current increases, and will be hence much larger\nin shorter wavelength devices. This latter effect may explain\nthe higher Jth values generally obtained for 980-nm QD lasers\n(Fig. 1), despite the low Auger contribution to Jth at these\nwavelengths.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe used spontaneous and stimulated emission measurements\nas a function of temperature and high hydrostatic pressure to\nanalyze the recombination processes in low-threshold current\ndensity 1.3-\u00b5m QD lasers. The results show that the radiative\ncomponent of the threshold current density, Jrad, is relatively\ntemperature insensitive around room temperature (RT), as\noriginally suggested by Arakawa and Sakaki [1]. However,\nthe temperature sensitivity of these lasers is caused by strong\nnonradiative recombination, which accounts for \u223c60% to 70%\nof Jth at RT. The temperature and pressure dependence of this\nnonradiative process suggest that it is due to Auger recombi-\nnation, which is very important in long wavelength QD lasers.\nThe study of the band gap dependence of the radiative part\nof Jth showed that the strong increase in the radiative current\ndensity with decreasing wavelength also explains the higher\ncurrent densities observed in 980-nm QD lasers, even though\nAuger recombination processes appear to be small at these\nwavelengths.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. A.
