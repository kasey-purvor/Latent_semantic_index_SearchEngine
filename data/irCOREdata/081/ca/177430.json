At the \nmicroscopic scale they have a similar lamellar structure but at a macroscopic scale they are \nvery different. Raman microscopy has been used to investigate compositional differences in \nthe two bone types using bone from standard laboratory mice in physiological conditions. \nClear differences were observed when complete spectra were compared by principal \ncomponent analysis (PCA). Analysis of individual bands showed cortical bone to have \ncompositional characteristics of older bone when compared with trabecular material, possibly \ndue to the higher bone turnover traditionally reported in the trabecular compartment. \n3 \nKeywords \nCortical bone, trabecular bone, mouse, Raman spectroscopy, composition \n4 \nIntroduction \nThe mammalian skeleton contains two different forms of bone, cortical and trabecular. \nCortical, or compact, bone is found mainly in the shafts of long bones and accounts for \nroughly 80% of bone mass [1]. Trabecular bone is found in vertebrae and the ends of long \nbones and is, in contrast, a porous foam-like structure with voids filled with bone marrow. \nBoth bone types are created by osteoblasts and resorbed by osteoclasts, and the controlled \ninteraction of both cell types enables bone growth during development and damage repair at \nmaturity to maintain mechanical strength. A hierarchy of structures can be seen in cortical and \ntrabecular bone at successively smaller length scales (see e.g. [1,2] for further details). At the \nmacroscopic scale bone types appear vastly different with cortical bone comprising \ncylindrical osteons (in mice the osteonal structure is not present and the cortex resembles a \n\u201csuper osteon\u201d as bone is not remodelled, probably because of its small size compared to \nosteoclasts and osteoblasts [3]) and trabecular bone forming a lattice of plates and rods. In \ncontrast, both bone types appear very similar at the molecular scale, being composed of \nmineralised collagen fibrils laid down with a preferred orientation in lamellae. Trabecular \nbone with its large surface area is more metabolically active than cortical bone [4] and is the \ntype of bone in which the quickest response to external factors is seen. For instance, studies \nhave shown athletic training in rodents [5] and man [6], ovariectomy [7], cathepsin K \noverexpression [8] and parathyroid hormone deficiency and excess [9] have a more \nimmediate effect in trabecular bone. In osteoporosis, a major disease of bone, fractures occur \nmostly in the hip, wrist and spine, areas with a high trabecular bone content [10]. \nA number of studies have examined cortical and trabecular bone types using a variety of \nmethods. Gong et al. compared their compositions in mammals by ashing and found that ash \nto organic fraction ratios were higher in cortical bone [11]; although cortical and trabecular \nsamples were taken from different anatomical sites in the animal and it is not clear how much \n5 \nof the difference could be a site variation. Differences in the mineral content have been \nmeasured in whole bone by micro-computed tomography [12] and X-ray diffraction, infra-red \n(IR) spectroscopy and chemical means [13]. Both of these studies showed cortical bone to be \nmore mineralised than trabecular bone. A chemical technique, used to measure collagen \ncross-linking in demineralised bone, showed cortical material to have more mature, \npyridinium type cross-links than trabecular bone [14]. The elastic properties of both bone \ntypes have been measured using nanoindentation [15,16], acoustic microscopy [17] or both \n[18], or back-calculated by comparing experimental results with finite element predictions \n[19]. Generally, cortical bone has been found to have a greater modulus than trabecular \nmaterial. The picture is clouded, however, by orientation effects, with cortical bone being \nstiffer longitudinally than transversely. To date the transverse modulus in a single trabecula \nhas not been measured because of difficulties due to its small size.  \nRaman microscopy provides a powerful way of determining the chemical properties of \nmaterials with a spatial resolution approaching a micrometre. In bone this enables the study of \nbiologically relevant locations, structures and process on this scale, often difficult with \nFourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) because of the inferior resolution associated \nwith this technique [20-24]. As Raman is a scattering phenomenon it can be used in reflection \nmode on solid samples. In contrast to FTIR, this technique is relatively insensitive to water, \nallowing the analysis of fully hydrated samples, and its non-destructive nature means the \nsame sample can be examined using a variety of different techniques. A further advantage is \nthat it can simultaneously measure organic and mineral phases. The Raman signal, however, \ndepends not only on the composition but also the local orientation of fibres or crystals with \nrespect to a polarised illuminating source, making interpretation of spectra from bone more \ncomplicated than from isotropic materials. Previous studies have used Raman \nmicrospectroscopy to compare bone from wild type and knock out animals to determine the \n6 \neffect of particular genes on bone e.g. [25,26], and to monitor the process of mineralisation in \nosteoblasts over time both in vitro [27] and in vivo [28]. The effect of aging has been \ninvestigated by observing changes in collagen band positions [29,30]. Lamellae in osteons \nhave been mapped by observing changes in the magnitude of the Amide I band [31] or from \nmeasurements in two orthogonal planes in cortical bone [32]. Although cortical and trabecular \nbone have been studied separately, there appears to have been no direct comparison between \nthem from closely related sites in the same animals. This study used Raman microscopy to \ncompare cortical and trabecular bone tissue from the same femur and tibia of standard \nlaboratory mice, C57 Black 6 (C57Bl6). To keep the bones in their physiological condition, \nsample preparation was kept to a minimum and was restricted to soft tissue removal and \ncutting to expose the cross section. \nMaterials and Methods \nMaterials \nCortical and trabecular samples were taken from the distal femur and proximal tibia from ten \n5-month-old, male, C57Bl6 mice. The bones had previously been broken in a 3-point bending \ntest and, because of difficulties holding the relevant section for cutting, samples were \nobtained from 5 of the tibiae only.  Skeletal maturity in terms of mechanical properties is \nreached at about 4 months [33]. Following soft tissue removal, 1.5 mm long transverse \nsections were cut using a mineralogical saw (Accutom 2, Struers, Glasgow) fitted with an \naluminium oxide cut-off wheel under constant irrigation with distilled water. Slices were then \nglued to a microscope slide with cyanoacrylate adhesive (Locktite) for acquiring spectra. \nSlides were kept submerged in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prior to and during testing. \n7 \nRaman microscopy \nA Renishaw inVia microscope (Renishaw plc, Gloucestershire, UK) fitted with a 300 mW, \n785 nm laser and x63\/0.95 numerical aperture Achroplan immersion objective lens (Zeiss) \nwas used to acquire spectra from the submerged bone samples. At the beginning of each \nimaging session the laser was checked for alignment with the optical axis of the microscope \nand the wavenumber datum verified against a silicon internal standard. Care was also taken to \nensure that the silicon band intensity was the same each time, thus ensuring comparability of \nspectral intensities. Data were recorded between 300 and 1800 cm\n-1\n at a resolution of better \nthan 4 cm\n-1\n. Between 10 and 40 spectra were recorded from random sites on each sample. \nEach spectrum was the result of 10 accumulations each with a 10 second exposure time. The \nspectra from each bone sample were averaged to give a representative spectrum for that bone. \nIn cortical regions spectra were taken at spots around the whole circumference of the bone \nand averaged, effectively removing any orientation effect due to the preferred orientation of \neither collagen or apatite and the polarisation vector of the incident laser beam. Spectra from \ntrabecular bone were acquired from a number of locations within the field of view however \nthe orientation of lamellae could not be discerned so it is possible some orientation bias \nremained after averaging. \n \nPreprocessing \nCosmic ray artefacts were removed manually from each spectrum using WIRE 2.0 software \n(Renishaw plc, Gloucestershire, UK). Noise was removed using a wavelet technique [34,35] \nand the underlying background signal subtracted from each spectrum using an iteratively \nfitted polynomial [36]. Preprocessing was performed using custom written procedures in \nMatlab (the Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Both peak heights and peak areas were \n8 \ncalculated but the analysis showed no difference in the results. We chose then to present only \nthe heights as these were simpler to derive, and there is precedence in the literature {{}}. \nSpectra were then analysed in 3 different ways: by direct comparison between spectra from \ncortical and trabecular bone, by comparison of parameters derived from peak intensities and, \nfinally, using principal components analysis (PCA). At no point were the spectra normalised. \nDifference spectra \nAverage spectra were calculated for each bone type by summing all the spectra (e.g. for \ntrabecular bone) and dividing by the number of spectra for that type of bone. A difference \nspectrum was found by subtracting the intensity of the trabecular spectrum from the cortical \nspectrum at each wave number. The significance of any difference was determined by \ncomparing the average spectra from cortical and trabecular bone using Student\u2019s t-test. \nPeak Parameters \nA typical spectrum from bone is shown in Figure 1 with the relevant band assignments \nmarked. The band at 961 cm\n-1\n corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibration (v1) of the \nphosphate ion and is the strongest marker of bone mineral. The phosphate bending vibrations \nv2 and v4 appear at 438 cm\n-1\n and 589 cm\n-1\n respectively while the non symmetric stretch (v3) \ncauses a band at about 1040 cm\n-1\n. A peak due to a superposition of carbonate and phosphate \nv3 appears at 1070 cm\n-1\n. The high frequency peaks arise from the organic phase and these are \nthe amide III (~1260 cm\n-1\n) and amide I (~1680 cm\n-1\n) peaks, which arise largely from the \ncollagen [37], and the CH2 peak which is present in both collagenous and non-collagenous \norganic molecules. Bone is laid down in lamellae, in both cortical and trabecular bone, and \nwithin each lamella collagen fibrils are partially aligned with the direction of preferred \norientation usually at angle to the bone or trabecular axis [2]. The triple helical arrangement \nof the collagen molecule constrains the positions of the amide bonds with respect to the \n9 \nmolecular axis. Within this bond the chemical groups contributing to the Amide I band \n(predominantly C=O) lie in a plane perpendicular to the molecular axis, while those \ncontributing to the Amide III band (mostly C-N) are both perpendicular and along this axis. \nMineral crystals are found within the collagen matrix with their crystallographic c-axis \naligned with the collagen fibres [2]. It has been shown that the maximum Raman signal is \nproduced when the polarisation of the exciting radiation is parallel with this axis [38]. \nOur experimental arrangement may result in trabecular samples having a preferred orientation \nwith respect to the incident laser beam. This factor can influence the intensity of a Raman \nsignal in addition to any compositional affect. We have used a method derived from the \npublished literature [39] to reduce the effect of orientation so we could attribute any \ndifference between readings from cortical and trabecular bone to differences in composition. \nThe intensity of the phosphate v4 peak was taken as an indicator of mineral content, in \npreference to any of the other phosphate bands, as it has been shown to be less susceptible to \norientation effects [39] and as an asymmetric bend it is less affected by polarisation [40]. For \nsimilar reasons the Amide III peak was used as a measure of collagen content [39]. The \nmineral to matrix ratio was calculated from the intensity of the phosphate v4 (mineral) peak \ndivided by Amide III (matrix) peak. While the peak at 1070 cm\n-1 \nis a formed by contributions \nfrom both carbonate and phosphate v3, it has been shown to be a good measure of the \ncarbonate content of bone [58]. The carbonate to phosphate ratio was, therefore, calculated by \ndividing the value from the carbonate peak (1070 cm\n-1\n) by the phosphate v4 peak and the \nrelative amount of HPO4\n2-\n by dividing the amplitude of this peak (1003 cm\n-1\n) by that of the \nphosphate v4 peak [37]. Values for the intensity of the carbonate and HPO4\n2-\n peaks were \nfound by curve fitting to remove any possible contribution from the phosphate v1 (960 cm\n-1\n) \nand v3 (1040 cm\n-1\n) bands. Two peaks can be fitted to the Amide I band, each indicative of a \ndifferent secondary structure within the collagen matrix. The ratio of these two peaks gives an \n10 \nindication of the abundance of each structure. In FTIR spectroscopy, this ratio has been \nshown to give a measure of mature, trivalent bonds compared with the immature, divalent \nvariety [41] while others have used it to show the change in collagen structure following \nloading beyond the yield point in a Raman experiment [20]. As bone matures so the size of \nthe individual mineral crystals increases, contributing to a narrower, more intense v1 peak, \nwhile at the same time increased substitutions into the crystal lattice by carbonate and other \nions reduce the purity of the crystal so reducing the peak height and increasing its width. The \nfull width at half maximum height of this peak taken together with the degree of substitution \nvalues (carbonate to phosphate ratio) give an indication of the degree of crystallinity of the \nmineral part of the bone [42]. \nPrincipal component analysis \nSpectra were presented for PCA following background subtraction and removal of \nwavenumbers with an average intensity remaining of less than 100 counts. Deleting these \nregions has no effect on peaks associated with bone. The components or variables generated \nfrom the PCA are common to femur and tibia as well as cortical and trabecular bone. After \nreference to a scree plot [43] scores for the first 6 coefficients from cortical and trabecular \nbone were then compared using Student\u2019s t-test as described below. \nStatistics \nData were found to be normally distributed (P>0.05 from Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) so mean \nvalues from each parameter were compared using 2-way ANOVA using bone type \n(cortical\/trabecular) and sample origin (femur\/tibia) as the two independent variables. No \ninteraction was found between these variables so results from femur and tibia were analyzed \nseparately using Student\u2019s t-tests. Due to the different number of spectra recorded from each \nsample a weighted comparison of means was used to calculate the P-value [44]. Results were \n11 \nconsidered significant if P<0.05. A custom script was written in Matlab (R2006b, the \nMathWorks, Inc) to perform t-tests and Sigmastat (Version 3.5, Systat Software Inc.) was \nused for other tests. \nResults \nDifference spectra \nPlots of the average spectra from cortical and trabecular bone from femur and tibia are shown \ntogether with their difference (Figure 2). For the femur the intensity of the signal coming from \ntrabecular bone (maximum v1 7400) was larger than that from the cortex (maximum v1 5800) \n(Figure 2A) and the difference was negative over the whole spectrum (Figure 2E). This \ndifference was not statistically significant in any regions corresponding to major peaks \n(Figure 2B). In the tibia this pattern was reversed; trabecular bone had a maximum signal for \nv1 of 9900 compared with v1 of 16200 from the cortical bone (Figure 2C), so the difference \nwas positive (Figure 2E). Overall, the magnitude of the difference in the tibia was about 3 \ntimes that seen in the femur and was significant (P < 0.05) at almost all wave numbers (Figure \n2D). \nPeak parameters \nThe mineral to matrix ratio (phosphate v4\/Amide III) was significantly greater in cortical bone \nthan in trabecular bone for both the femur (P=0.001) and the tibia (P=0.002) (Figures 3A and \n3B, respectively). The carbonate to phosphate ratio was also greater in cortical than trabecular \nbone (Figure 4). The difference was significant in tibia (P<0.001), while in femur the \nsignificance reached P=0.054, marginally outside the traditional threshold. The ratio of \nhydrogen phosphate to phosphate was bigger in trabecular bone in both femur and tibia \nalthough the difference was not significant (Figure 5). There were no significant differences \nin the ratio of intensities of peaks fitted within the amide I band (Figure 6) or the FWHM of \n12 \nthe phosphate v1 peak (Figure 7) between cortical and trabecular bone, in either the femur or \nthe tibia. \nPCA \nThe first principal component (PC) (Figure 8) accounted for 99% of the variance within the \ndata. It corresponds very closely with a Raman spectrum from bone. Scores from this \ncomponent from cortical and trabecular bone were significantly different in tibia (25200 and -\n900, P=0.01) but not in femur (-16800 and -10500, P=0.27). \nAverage scores for PCs 2-6 are displayed in Figure 9. Scores for PCs 2 and 3 for trabecular \nbone were positive and significantly (P<0.01) different from those from cortical bone, which \nwere negative, in both femur and tibia. The position was reversed for PCs 5 and 6 where the \nscores for trabecular bone were negative while those from cortical bone were positive, \nalthough this difference was only significant (P<0.05) in tibia but not in femur. The PCs \nmentioned are plotted in Figure 10 below and show where the main differences lie in relation \nto a typical bone spectrum. \nDiscussion \nRaman microscopy has been used to investigate the differences in bone chemistry between \ncortical and trabecular bone from C57Bl6 mice. Our results show the bone types are different, \nwith cortical bone being more mineralized and with a greater carbonate content. These \ndifferences are consistent with cortical bone appearing \u201colder\u201d than trabecular material [45] as \ntraditionally believed from other studies of bone turnover (refs?) \n \nThe laser used for Raman excitation is linearly polarised. In addition, bone contains lamellae \nwhich themselves contain oriented collagen fibres and mineral crystallites. This means that \nmany of the Raman bands are sensitive to the orientation of the sample with respect to the \n13 \npolarisation of the beam. This has been almost unrecognised in the mineralised tissue \nliterature in spite of many publications investigating bone composition using a similar \nexperimental arrangement to ours. Because we recognised this issue late in our experimental \nwork and had not included polarising optics in the beam path, we tried to take steps to \nminimise the effects by selecting bands that are reported to be least sensitive to polarisation \n[39]. This is a complicated problem and a full treatment is beyond the scope of this article.  \n \nDifference \nThe intensity of a Raman signal is primarily due to the number of scattering centres excited \nwithin the sample [46,47]. This can be affected by a number of factors including the \norientation of the molecules with respect to a polarised incident beam [39], the mode of \nmolecular vibration [40], and the presence of other atoms or scattering centres, though each of \nthese is likely to affect particular bands in the spectrum.  \nWith the experimental arrangement used in this study, the sampling volume was full of bone \nin all cases and care was taken to ensure that the laser intensity remained constant, as judged \nby the silicon standard. If, therefore, the bone material was the same in all cases, a similar \nsignal intensity from both cortical and trabecular bone and from tibia and femur would be \nexpected. Having taken these precautions in the recording of the spectra, normalisation of the \nspectra was not undertaken in order to obtain a direct measure of the composition of the bone \nmatrix in each type of bone in each of the femur and tibia.  \nThe measured intensities and difference spectra above show some unexpected results: a \nsignificantly larger signal was obtained from both the cortical and trabecular bone from the \ntibia than the femur, with the biggest difference being found in cortical bone in which \napproximately 3 times the signal was measured from the tibia than from the femur. Signal \n14 \nfrom trabecular bone was similar in both femur and tibia. In the femur, the cortical signal was \nslightly, but not significantly, smaller than that from trabecular bone, whereas in the tibia this \nwas reversed, with cortical bone yielding a much higher signal. Some of the difference may \nbe due to the different loading regimes experienced by the two bones (new ref?), although \nthere are likely to be other factors which are currently under investigation. \nBand intensity parameters \nMineralization of the collagen matrix is reported to be a two stage process occurring outside \nthe osteoblast. An initial mineralisation phase of a few months is followed by a longer more \ngradual phase resulting in fully mineralised bone [4]. As the mineralisation process proceeds \nso the chemistry of the mineral alters with the carbonate content increasing and the \nmonohydrogen phosphate (HPO4\n2-\n) content decreasing [45,48]. An assessment of the relative \namounts of these materials - mineral to matrix ratio, carbonate to phosphate ratio, HPO4\n2-\n to \nphosphate ratio \u2013 would give an indication of the age of the bone being investigated. The \nintensity of any of the three phosphate peaks have been used widely as indicators of mineral \ncontent in bone, while the Amide I or III bands are markers of collagen [20,37,49,50] (see \nFigure 1 above). We have selected the phosphate v4 mode and the Amide III band because of \ntheir insensitivity to orientation and polarisation effects [39,40]. The carbonate ion is a natural \npart of bone mineral, substituting for hydroxide (A-type) and phosphate (B-type) [51,52]. \nBoth types can be detected in a Raman spectrum of bone with B-type producing a band at \n~1070 cm\n-1\n and the A type a weak shoulder at ~1104 cm\n-1 \n[28] (see Figure 1). We have used \nthe B-type substitution as an indicator of carbonate content because of its association with \naging [45,48]. Our measure of mineral to matrix ratio shows cortical bone was more \nmineralised than trabecular material, in agreement with other studies [11-13]. Taken with the \nhigher carbonate to phosphate ratio and lower HPO4\n2-\n to phosphate ratio\n \nwe found in cortical \n15 \nbone these results suggest cortical bone is older than trabecular material, a finding consistent \nwith the lower turnover of bone observed in the cortical compartment [53]. \nComparing the intensity of the profiles fitted within the main bands of a Raman spectrum \nyields further information about the nature of the collagen and mineral within the sample. For \nexample, the ratio of two profiles centred at 1670 and 1690 cm\n-1\n fitted within the Amide I \nband in an FTIR spectrum gives a measure of the degree of collagen cross-linking in the bone \n[41] with an increase in the ratio indicative of a greater proportion of mature or trivalent \ncross-links. Other authors have also used this measure in Raman spectroscopy [22,54,55] \nalthough this has never been shown experimentally, so it is probably more accurate to \nattribute the two peaks to different collagen secondary structures. Our investigation showed \nno differences in the organisation of the mineral or matrix compartments of bone from \ncortical and trabecular regions. \nPCA \nPCA assesses intensities at all wavenumbers simultaneously and generates ordered \ncomponents or variables that account for the variance within the data analysed. The first few \ncomponents describe the majority of the variance and so can be used instead of the original \nvariables (wavenumbers in this case) to analyse the data. Typically, of the order of ten new \nvariables, the modes of variation or principal components, are used to replace the vast number \nof original variables. Due to the nature of PCA these new variables are orthogonal, or \nindependent. Each mode is assigned a score that describes the spectrum from each sample and \nthis smaller number of variables can be treated as any other data. \nIn this study, Coefficient 1 is very similar to a typical Raman spectrum from bone and the \nscore represents a signal magnitude for each sample. This arises because the data are not \n16 \nnormalised during analysis as described above. 99% of the variance is explained by this \nvariable indicating signal strength is the biggest difference between individual measurements. \nAs can be seen in Figure 10, the Amide I band is the only complete band seen in PC2. \nAdjacent positive and negative peaks seen in the phosphate v1, v2 and v4 bands are suggestive \nof peak wavenumber shifts or changes in relative intensities of sub bands. Analysis of profile \ncentres indicates that sub-bands from cortical bone occur at a slightly higher wavenumbers \nthan corresponding sub-bands from trabecular bone. A similar finding was made when \nmeasuring the effect of compression on bone using Raman microscopy [56]. This may \nsuggest cortical bone is preloaded, possibly as a form of protection against excessive loads, in \na similar way to wood in the trunk of trees [57]. \nPC3 has bands coinciding with those arising from collagen in bone. An inverted carbonate \npeak is also seen along with a negative spike centred at about 954 cm\n-1\n, usually assigned to a \ncarbonate substituted apatite [48] or octacalcium phosphate (OCP) [24]. This coefficient \ncould be thought of as an inverse mineral: matrix ratio and as the scores from trabecular bone \nare higher (see Figure 9) would suggest the mineral: matrix ratio is lower in trabecular bone. \nThis is in agreement with the mineral: matrix ratio derived from individual peaks (see Figure \n3). \nCoefficients 5 and 6 are very similar with negative portions in the phosphate v2 and v4 and \namide I regions and positive sections in proline (840-900 cm\n-1\n), B type carbonate, Amide III \nand CH2 bands. The major difference is in the phosphate v1 band where the adjacent positive \nand negative peaks are inverted between the two PCs. Unsurprisingly, the scores from these \nPCs are similar in each sample.  \nTaken together, these results show there are differences in the Raman scattering between \ncortical and trabecular bone from the mice examined in this paper, reflecting differences \n17 \nfound using other techniques. Cortical bone appears \u201colder\u201d than trabecular bone and this \ncould arise from the lower turnover generally reported in cortical bone [4]. The different \nsignals found between femoral and tibial bone were a surprise, as was also the inversion of \nthe ratio of cortical to trabecular signal in going from femur to tibia. Further studies are \nunderway to try to understand the origins of these results. \n18 \n References \n[1] Cowin SC. Bone mechanics handbook.
