CONCLUSION\nThe addition of a light weight dielectric lens to a dual-polarized\nquad-ridge horn has shown to improve the boresight efficiency over\nthe 5\u201315 GHz band and achieve 70% aperture efficiency over most of\nthe band. The dielectric lens did not significantly impact the S11 or iso-\nlation of either the H-pol or V-pol ports; S11 of less than\u0000\u0000\u0002 \u0003\u0004 over\nmost of the band was achieved with a worst case of \u0000\u0005\u0000\u0006 \u0003\u0004.\nThe finite element method has shown to produce results that are in\nreasonable agreement with all of the measurements including E-plane\nand H-plane pattern measurements with the exception of: x-pol pat-\ntern levels less than approximately \u0000\u0007\u0002 \u0003\u0004\b and port-port isolation.\nThis is most likely due to manufacturing tolerances not included in the\nmodel and noise from the measurement; such noise sources include\nx-pol from the anechoic chamber source antenna, antenna misalign-\nments, and scattering from floor and the antenna fixtures. However, in\ngeneral the finite element method has proven to be a very accurate tool\nthat can be used to design or modify existing designs of a quad-ridge\nhorn or a similar type of 3-D radiating structure that includes a dielec-\ntric lens.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.

INTRODUCTION\nThe operation of circularly polarized (CP) microstrip antennas may\nbe viewed as the superposition of two or more linearly polarized (LP)\nmodes with equal amplitudes and appropriate phasing to generate a\nrotating field. Various techniques for generating CP waves have been\nreported in the literatures. The antenna can utilize LP or CP element,\nand can be fed using various feed mechanisms. Typical feed structures\nare: an offset feed to a single patch; two feeds with phase quadrature;\nsequential feed to a multi-element array. Huang [1] first proposed the\nuse of four LP patches, positioned orthogonally, and fed sequentially\nwith 90\u0000 phase shifts. A wideband square microstrip patch antenna was\nproposed in [2], using a corporate feed network with sequential phase-\nshifts for CP operation. In [4], a patch antenna array using CP elements\nand sequential rotation via a serial feed arrangement was presented.\nManuscript received April 11, 2008; revised June 25, 2008.

Configuration of the proposed antenna.\nAn axial ratio bandwidth \u0000\u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005 \u0000 \u0006 \u0007\u0004\b of 3.5% was obtained in\nthis latter work. A serial feed with sequential phase shift underneath a\nsquare patch coupled by a cross slot for CP was proposed in [5]. This\ntechnique simplified the feed network on single element, and a 4.6%\nARBW was reported. Using the basic principle from Min and Free [6]\nshowed that the patches could be arranged in an annular configuration\nto achieve good CP quality.\nThe work described in this paper extends the techniques previously\nreported in the literatures to provide a microstrip CP antenna with en-\nhanced radiation properties. A novel arrangement of dual concentric\nring arrays, shown in Fig. 1, is fed by a hybrid feed network such that\nthe phase distribution to the patches will generate CP waves. The pri-\nmarily benefit of the new arrangement is that there is a more uniform\ndistribution of radiating elements, compared to previously reported de-\nsigns, and this should enhance the quality of CP radiation.\nHowever, a critical requirement for this type of antenna is that all the\nradiating elements should radiate the same amount of power. Clearly,\nwith a sequential feed technique, some scheme is necessary for succes-\nsively changing the amount of energy coupled to each patch. This issue\nhas largely been ignored by previous authors. Therefore, a schematic\nmodel was developed so that each radiating element will receive an\nidentical amount of power from the feed line. The required coupling\nwas achieved using non-resonant slots in the ground plane beneath each\npatch, as shown in Fig. 1, these slots being fed from a microstrip line\non the side of the antenna. Measured results are presented to confirm\nthe validity of the design and proposed model for power feeding.\nII. MODEL FOR COUPLED POWER CONTROL\nThe configuration of the proposed traveling-wave (TW)-fed, dual-\nring array is shown in Fig. 1. The microstrip feed line is formed on\nFig. 2. Simulated mutual coupling levels between adjacent elements.\none side of the circuit and the radiating elements on the other. The mi-\ncrostrip and radiating elements share a common ground plane that con-\ntains apertures to couple power from the microstrip line to the patches.\nThe aperture-coupled feed technique was first proposed by Pozar [3] in\nwhich a non-resonant aperture slot was utilized for the excitation of ra-\ndiating elements. This technique can conveniently be applied on a TW\nfeed line. The propagating fields along the feed line induce a magnetic\ncurrent along the aperture slot, and a portion of energy is coupled to\nthe radiating element at resonance. Since power is coupled out through\neach slot in turn, leaving less for the remaining slots and patches, in-\ncreased coupling is required for patches excited further down the line.\nThe coupling is adjusted by offsetting the slots from the center of the\nline by a distance \u0000\u0002\u0000\u0002\b, as shown in Fig. 1. This concept provides\ndesign flexibility to guarantee that each radiating element is able to re-\nceive an identical amount of power from the feed line. It was found\nthat a larger offset of the slot resulted in less power being coupled to\nthe patch.\nFig. 2 shows the simulated mutual coupling levels between adjacent\nelements in the array. They were found to be all below\u000020 dB, which\nwere relatively small, and may have negligible effects back to the struc-\nture. This condition enabled to analyze and formulate the coupling be-\nhaviors within the array. The proposed model for coupled power con-\ntrol is shown in Fig. 3. It is seen that the input power is split between the\ninner and outer rings. Since the radiating elements were connected in\ncascade and fed in a sequential manner, it was important to include in\nthe model the loss factors (\u0003\u0000 and \u0003\u0002) in the feed lines between adja-\ncent elements, to ensure that each element received the same amount of\npower that can be expressed in terms of a power ratio \u0000\u0004\u0003\u0004\u0005 \b relative\nto the input power \u0000\u0004\u0006\u0007\b. The power delivered to the first element each\nof the two rings was defined as \u0000\u0005\u0003\u0004\u0000\u0003\u0006 and \u0000\u0005\u0005\u0004\u0000\n\u0003\n\u0006\n, relative to the input\npower, respectively. The design equations were then derived from var-\nious senses of signal propagations within the structure. It was realized\nthat the power delivered to each element had the contributions from\nthe direct power transmission, the reflections from subsequent and pre-\nceding elements, and multiple reflections between the elements in the\nsubarrays. It was found that larger delivered power to the elements re-\nsults in the increase of efficiency. However, larger coupling generates\nmore inductive reactance that causes impedance mismatch around the\ndesign\u2019s center frequency. Therefore, in order to maintain acceptable\nreflection level \u0000\u0000\u0005\u0004\u0004\u0000\u0003 \u0000 \u0002\t\n \u0007\u0004\b, it is suggested that one may se-\nlect a coupling factor to be less than 20% of the input power for the\nterminal elements. Since the direct power transmission from the input\ndominates the delivered power, and based on the suggested design cri-\nterion, the coupling factor \u0000\u0006\b\b for each element in the subarrays can\nthen be approximated in terms of the coupled power ratio \u0000\u0004\u0003\u0004\u0005\b and\nthe propagation behaviors in the structure, as expressed in (1)\u2013(4).

Full-wave analysis\ncan then be applied to obtain the offset distances needed corresponding\nto the designed coupling factors of each element from its \u0000-parame-\nters responses using (5). In the proposed antenna design, the parame-\nters were initially selected and summarized as follows: \u0002\u0000\u0002\u0003 \u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0002\u0003,\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0002\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0004 \u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0004\u0005\u0003, \u0000\u0000\u0003\u0002\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0004 \u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0004\u0003\u0006, \u0004\u0004 \u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0002\u0005\u0007, and \u0004\u0005 \u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0002\u0002\u0007. The\ncalculated results of the coupling factors are shown in Fig. 4.

The ring radii were selected as \u0010\u0002 \u0000 \u0005\u000f\u0003\u0003 \u0010\u0010,\nand \u0010\u0000 \u0000 \u0003\u0005 \u0010\u0010 for the \u0007 \u0000 \u0004 and \n \u0000 \u0011 subarrays, respectively.\nBased on the material parameters, the required offset distances were\nobtained using full-wave analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 5.\nFig. 6 shows the reflection coefficient \b\u0000\u0000\u0002\u0002\u0000\t of the antenna.

A transmission\/reflection (T\/R) efficiency\n\b\u0011\r\u000e\u000f\t was defined as the ratio of the total power consumed in the an-\ntenna system to the input power, as shown in Fig. 7.

Measured radiation patterns of the antenna with and without the con-\nducting plane at 10 GHz.\nFig. 9. Measured front-to-back ratio (FBR) of the antenna with and without the\nconducting plane.\nfor this type of antenna, one would expect a higher transmission loss\nthrough the rings so that little power was wasted in the terminations. It\nis important to realize that the power consumed in the antenna will be\nthe sum of that radiated, plus that dissipated as loss within the materials\nof the antenna. By appropriate choices of materials for the antenna, the\npower lost can be minimized.\nFig. 8 shows the radiation patterns of the antenna at 10 GHz. The\npatterns were found to be symmetric in the boresight, which means\nthat each radiating element in the array contributes identical amount\nof power. An additional conducting plane with a size of \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\nwas placed behind the antenna by a distance of \u0000\u0000\u0002\u0000 away behind\nthe antenna to investigate the pattern characteristics. The first-null\nbeamwidth was narrowed from 70.2\u0000 to 61.2\u0000 with the conducting\nplane. Meanwhile, a 10 dB improvement on the front-to-back ratio\n(FBR) was achieved at the design\u2019s center frequency. It is seen from\nFig. 9 that the FBR decreased considerably away from the center\nfrequency. It is explained as a fact that the elements contributed less\nradiation to the boresight due to the decrease of radiation efficiency.\nThe antenna was formed from a multilayer structure, and it was\nrealized that misalignment errors could have a significant effect on\nthe results. This alignment error will become critical at mm-wave fre-\nquencies, and it is suggested that the misalignment should be kept\nwithin \u00025% of the designed values. The gain of the test antenna can\nbe extracted by measuring the power transmission of the two-antenna\nsystem, and compensating for the known losses of the system compo-\nnents. The results are shown in Fig. 10.\nTwo single-ring arrays with four \u0002\u0003 \u0003 \u0004\u0005\u0004\u0006 \u0007\u0007\b and eight \u0002\u0003 \u0003\n\u0006\u0004\u0007\u0007\b elements were developed utilizing the proposed design criteria\nand model for the comparisons of the CP quality with the dual-ring\nFig. 10. Measured axial ratio and gain of the antenna.\narray design. For the single-ring, four-element array, the best AR was\nfound to be 0.6 dB at 10.05 GHz. The measured ARBW was 7.2%.\nGood CP quality was also achieved on the eight-element array. The\nminimal AR was 0.8 dB at 10.1 GHz, and ARBW to be 6.6%. Improved\nARBW was found on the dual-ring array with the minimal AR of 0.5 dB\nat 9.8 GHz and ARBW of 8.5%. The symmetry of measured radiation\npatterns in conjunction with good CP quality achieved have proven the\nproposed model for power control to be valid and applicable for the\nseries-fed CP array designs.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe design of a novel TW-fed CP antenna has been established\nthrough practical measurements. The measured results were in good\nagreement with those predicted from theoretical simulations. The\nmeasured antenna exhibited good CP quality at the design frequency,\nwith well-behaved radiation patterns and moderately high gain. Due\nto the trade-off between the system efficiency and reflection levels\nin the antenna, one may improve the efficiency by selecting a larger\nvalue for the delivered power to the elements with the inclusions of\nthe reflections in the antenna. The proposed model can then be further\nexpanded to improve the performance of the antenna whilst main-\ntaining CP quality. This type of antenna has good potential for further\ndevelopment, both as a wideband antenna, and also for inclusion in\nplanar microwave integrated circuits.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
