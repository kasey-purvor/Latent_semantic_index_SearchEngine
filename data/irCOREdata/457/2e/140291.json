We address \u2018how\u2019 FPp\nis applied in terms of its operational and logistics implications within manufacturing\nfacilities. This paper is a retrospective study of the application of FPp in three diverse\nmanufacturing environments: a manufacturer of specialist high voltage cabling\nequipment we call \u2018Electrico\u2019; a manufacturer of industrial electric motors we call\n\u2018Motorco\u2019; and a manufacturer of control systems and components mainly for\nautomated telling machines we call \u2018Controlco\u2019.\nOur findings show that FPp improved responsiveness of manufacturing in all cases,\nbut that none of the applications of FPp was ideal from a theoretical perspective. The\nproduction planning system must be both responsive and flexible to support the\napplication. For highly customised products, the customer order decoupling point\n(CODP) must be located sufficiently upstream in the manufacturing process to avoid\nremoval of components and time- consuming modifications. We present conclusions\nfrom all three studies, including an inventory management decision framework for\nFPp and a framework for the application of FPp which encompasses a number of\npractical considerations.\n2Keywords\nForm postponement; responsiveness, customization; decoupling point\n31 Introduction\nMarkets are increasingly characterized by uncertainty of demand and supply, and by\nmass customization of products to meet individual needs. Uncertainty has been\nreviewed by Yang et al (2004), and mass customization by Mikkola and Skj\u03c6tt-\nLarsen (2004). Both sets of authors position postponement as an enabler to meeting\nthe operational and logistics challenges that are presented. However, \u2018little is still\nknown about the implementation of postponement\u2019 (Yang and Burns, 2003). We\nhave focused specifically on form postponement (FPp), which we define as:\n\u2018\u2026.the delay, until customer orders are received, of the final part of the\ntransformation processes, through which the number of different items (stock keeping\nunits) proliferates, and for which only a short time period is available. The postponed\ntransformation processes may be manufacturing processes, assembly processes,\nconfiguration processes, packaging, or labelling processes\u2019.\nSo far, we have contributed two papers to this journal which help to throw light on\nissues of implementation of FPp. Our first study (Skipworth and Harrison, 2004)\nfeatured a manufacturer of specialist high voltage cabling equipment which we called\n\u2018Electrico\u2019; the second was a manufacturer of industrial electric motors we called\n\u2018Motorco\u2019 (Skipworth and Harrison, 2006). In addition to describing the cases and\nthe results of our investigations in each, these papers provide our conceptual model of\nFPp, together with a review of relevant literature which we do not repeat in this paper.\nHere, we report a third case study at \u2018Controlco\u2019, where the product was specifically\ndesigned for FPp, unlike the cables at Electrico and the motors at Motorco. Instead\n4the FPp regime was applied to an existing product range previously engineered to\norder (ETO) or made to order (MTO). Second, we compare our findings from all\nthree studies across the operational implications within the manufacturing facility -\nsuch as inventory management strategy, product design, production variety, and\nproduction scheduling. Also, we compare the impact of FPp on common performance\nmetrics, including delivery reliability, order lead-time, demand amplification, capacity\nutilisation, and throughput efficiency. Finally, we develop conclusions from a cross-\ncase comparison of all three studies. Our conclusions include an inventory\nmanagement decision framework for FPp and a framework for applying FPp - which\nencompasses a number of practical considerations such as guidelines for positioning\nthe customer order decoupling point (CODP). The CODP decouples forecast-driven\noperations that are run in anticipation of customer orders, and order-driven operations\nthat are based on customer orders (van Hoek, 2001).\n2 Research Design\nWe sought to address the question \u2018how is FPp applied in manufacturing\u2019. We also\naddressed the motivation for applying FPp, and the impact it has on various\nperformance metrics - particularly those related to customer service. The six\npropositions we sought to test were taken from our theoretical framework (shown in\ntable 1) as indicated by the shaded areas and the labels P1 to P6. These propositions\narose from a consideration of the research questions, the FPp conceptual model, and a\nliterature review (Skipworth and Harrison, 2004). In summary, they are:\nWhat is the demand profile of products selected for manufacture under FPp?\n5P1: Products are selected for manufacture under FPp rather than MTS when\nthey exhibit high demand mix, high demand variability, and low volume\ndemand at finished product level.\nP2: Products are selected for manufacture under FPp rather than ETO when\nthey exhibit high volume demand at generic product level.\nWhat is the impact on customer service of FPp?\nP3: FPp considered as an alternative to MTS increases ex-stock availability.\nP4: FPp considered as an alternative to ETO reduces order lead-times and\nincreases delivery reliability but introduces demand amplification.\nWhat are the product design implications of applying FPp?\nP5: Product families subject to FPp will have a higher level of standardization\nand modularity than product families subject to ETO\nWhat are the manufacturing planning and scheduling implications of applying FPp?\nP6: Capability of the postponed transformation process to respond to high\ndemand variability requires excess capacity and high throughput efficiency\nEach proposition compares FPp with either ETO or MTO and MTS regimes across a\nnumber of characteristics and suggests that differences will be measurable across the\nthree regimes.\nTable 1: Theoretical framework illustrating the propositions\nThe Electrico case study (Skipworth and Harrison, 2004) addressed a product (high\nvoltage cabling) which was configured rather than customised. The \u2018Motorco\u2019 study\n(Skipworth and Harrison, 2006) focused on an FPp regime applied to Large Direct\nCurrent (LDC) motors. These are relatively complex products that were highly\ncustomised and therefore produced in high variety. Our third study at Controlco\nexamined the application of FPp to the manufacture of encrypted pin pads (destined\nfor automatic telling machines) which were designed to be manufactured by FPp.\n62.1 Within Case Comparison of Different Regimes\nIn order to test the above propositions, it was necessary to compare the three\napproaches to production (we refer to these as \u2018regimes\u2019) within the same operating\nfacility and for the same time period. These regimes (ETO or MTO, MTS and FPp)\nbecame our units of analysis (UoA\u2019s). The advantage of this research design was to\nscreen out contextual differences between operating facilities that would not have\nbeen relevant to our study. Table 2 summarises the UoA\u2019s used in each case. UoA\u2019s\nfor the three case studies were as follows:\n\uf0b7 Electrico: the three UoA\u2019s were all the same cable group dictated by customer\nrather than product group.\n\uf0b7 Motorco: the ETO UoA consisted of different LDC motors to those encompassed\nby the FPp and MTS UoAs - which were both based on the UK standard motor\nspecifications.\n\uf0b7 Controlco: keypad products were selected for both the FPp and MTO UoA\u2019s.\nHowever, a different product (a pushbutton body) was selected for the MTS UoA\nbecause no keypads were MTS.\nTable 2: Comparison of the UoAs used in the three case studies\nThe net result was that the three UoA\u2019s within each case study compared products of\nvery similar design. This ensured that the comparison between the different\napproaches (FPp, MTO and MTS), in terms of the various measures, screened out\nproduct-specific factors. The only exception was the MTS UoA in the Controlco case\n- this was not a keypad product like the FPp and MTO UoA\u2019s. However the\ncomplexity of the product and the manufacturing processes were very similar to the\nkeypads. We took this exception into account.\n72.2 Data Collection\nEvidence was collected across a number of production characteristics, explained in\nmore detail in our earlier paper (Skipworth & Harrison, 2006) and summarised here:\nDemand: external demand was quantified from the customer order ex-works due dates\nand quantities. Three measures of demand were taken for each case: demand mix\n(number of variants), average volume at both generic and end item level, and\nvariability of demand. Coefficient of variation (CV) was used as a measure of weekly\ndemand variability.\nDemand Amplification: this was mapped for a single member of the supply chain\n(Bicheno 1998). External customer orders (demand imposed on the manufacturing\nsystem) and orders placed at each manufacturing stage (the manufacturing process\nschedule) were plotted against time.\nCustomer service measures: Order lead-time was recorded between customer placing\nthe order and receiving it. Delivery reliability compared delivery date and quantity\nwith the due date, to establish if the delivery was made on-time in-full (OTIF). Ex-\nstock availability measured the proportion of orders and enquiries for which the\ncorrect stock (finished or generic) was available.\nProduct standardization: we used Collier\u2019s (1981, 1982) commonality index to\nmeasure the average number of common parent items per distinct component part, or\nas we prefer, the average number of incidences of the distinct component parts in a set\nof parent items.\n8Product Modularity: this is a relative property \u2013 products cannot be classified as\neither modular or not but rather exhibit more or less modularity in design. We used a\nmeasure based on the similarity between the physical and functional architectures of\nthe design (Ulrich, 1994).\nExcess Capacity: is the percentage amount that available capacity exceeds demand\nand was indicated by capacity utilisation and design capacity levels.\nThroughput efficiency: is the time taken for value adding activities to be performed on\na typical batch quantity (\u2018value added time\u2019), as a proportion of the time the factory\nwas available to add value (\u2018elapsed time\u2019 - New 1993).\nProduction Variety: this maps the number of physically different items against the\naverage process lead time.\nVan Hoek (2001) observes that \u2018triangulation [in postponement research] requires a\ncomprehensive, coherent and carefully integrated research design\u2019. By developing a\nbroad-based set of measures, we collected and analysed evidence using both the\ntriangulation of methods and the triangulation of data sources. In order to ensure the\nvalidity of within case comparisons between different regimes, we collected data for\neach regime for customer orders due for delivery within the same period.\nTaped interviews were used to collect qualitative data. These interviews included\nboth structured and open-ended questions, which explored the views of informants\nwho were selected for their knowledge and experience of a given process. Evidence\nfrom the taped interviews was corroborated by documentary, archival or database\nevidence.\n93 Analysing the Form Postponement Applications in\nContext\nHere, we compare the contexts of the three cases, describe the FPp applications and\nreport the main flaws in these applications.\n3.1 Contextual Considerations\nThe three products made under FPp were all industrial products manufactured by\nmedium sized companies in England (120 to 200 employees). All three products\nexhibited \u2018component swapping\u2019 modularity (Pine, 1993) where \u2018different\ncomponents are paired with the same basic product\u2019 to provide high variety in the\nfinished product. All three companies manufactured and stocked the generic or basic\nproduct (Electrico: laid up cable, Motorco: standard motor, Controlco: unconfigured\nkeypad) and then combined them with differentiating components in the postponed\nprocess.\nTable 3: Cross-case comparison of contextual data relating to the FPp\napplications\nThe three cases of FPp were otherwise very different, as the data in table 3 illustrates.\nThe products varied in complexity, as the number of distinct components illustrates.\nCables made by Electrico were simple products whereas motors made at Motorco\nwere more complex, requiring on average 160 distinct components and frequently in\nexcess of 200.\nVolume versus variety: EPP keypads manufactured by Controlco were mass\ncustomised for the High Street banks. The keypads exhibited high variety at finished\nproduct level and high volume at generic product level. Motors subject to FPp at\nMotorco were manufactured in similar variety but at very low volumes - even at\n10\ngeneric product level. Electrico cables, though produced in high volumes, exhibited\nan unexpectedly low level of variety \u2013 far below their potential variety..\nManufacturing Process: Manufacturing processes at the three facilities reflected\nproduct diversity, as illustrated by the total value added process times \u2013 37 hours for a\nmotor compared to 9 minutes for a keypad!\n\uf0b7 Electrico: manufacturing was semi continuous in that length - rather than discrete\nparts - was manufactured. Also, cable making was entirely equipment driven and\norganised as a batch process.\n\uf0b7 Motorco: a variety of machines was employed in a broad range of processes (such\nas soldering, machining and curing) and organised into process cells.\n\uf0b7 Controlco: only simple manual assembly processes requiring a few gluing\nmachines and a lasering machine were conducted.\nReasons for applying FPp: In all three cases FPp was seen as an alternative to\nMTO\/ETO. MTS was not considered an option for products subject to FPp.\nAccordingly FPp was applied to reduce the order lead-time achieved by MTO\/ETO\nand thereby improve responsiveness. In the case of Electrico there was a need to\nimprove the match between cable supply and their biggest customer\u2019s demand, and to\navoid the \u2018feast and famine\u2019 supply experienced with MTO. At Motorco, UK\ncustomers expected that motors based on a standard specifications would be available\non a 3 to 4 week lead-time \u2013 not the 10 to 14 weeks achieved by ETO.\n11\nThe only product to be specifically designed for \u201clast minute configuration\u201d (FPp)\nwas Controlco\u2019s EPP keypad. The design sought to improve responsiveness of supply\nto their biggest customer without incurring the high component stocks that had\nplagued the previous keypad range.\n3.2 The Form Postponement Applications\nHere, we compare the application of FPp in terms of product and customer selection,\ninventory management and manufacturing planning. Highlights are presented in table\n4.\nSelection of products and customers: In both Electrico and Controlco cases, FPp\nwas applied exclusively to products for their biggest customers - providing them with\nenhanced responsiveness.\n\uf0b7 Electrico: the restriction to one customer was artificial \u2013 FPp could have been\nequally well applied to many other cables.\n\uf0b7 Controlco: the EPP keypad was designed and manufactured exclusively for their\nbiggest customer.\n\uf0b7 Motorco: the products to be subject to FPp were selected at the generic level (30\nUK standard motors) and any motor variants based on these standard\nspecifications were subject to FPp regardless of customer.\nTable 4: Cross-case comparison of the \u2018change content\u2019 data for the FPp\napplications.\nAt Electrico, only the high volume finished cable items were selected. Thus for a\ngiven generic cable some finished cable variants were subject to FPp whilst others\n12\n(with only a different sheath colour) were supplied under MTO. This further\nunnecessary restriction was because the sheathing polymer supplied into the\npostponed process was required on consignment stock to ensure its availability within\n24 hours whilst postponing procurement of the polymer until consumption.\nMotorco and Controlco did not have this problem with the supply of components into\nthe postponed process. Motorco did not provide such a responsive supply to\ncustomers and therefore time was available to make or purchase many modification\ncomponents to order. Controlco required immediate availability of keytips for the\npostponed keypad configuration; these were made in-house to kanbans, so volume\nwas not a major issue.\nInventory Management: Order promising at Motorco was based on modification and\npart availability, so quoted lead-times were long and variable. This was attributable to\nthe highly customised nature of the motors \u2013 customers were free to choose any\ncustomising components. In contrast at Electrico and Controlco the confinement of\nFPp to predefined customising options enabled a standard order lead-time to be\noffered.\nAt Motorco customer orders were communicated by either hard copy purchase orders\nor by fax on an ad hoc basis. At Electrico customer orders were communicated by fax\nevery Tuesday. At Controlco, customer orders were communicated by EDI every\nmorning at 9:00 am and Controlco sales administrators processed orders immediately.\nManufacturing Planning: All three firms employed MRP systems driven by fixed\nperiod master scheduling for planning and control. At Controlco and Motorco the\n13\nMRP systems were compiled nightly. At Electrico the MRP system was compiled\nweekly (it required two days for compilation) restricting the customer to placing\nweekly orders every Tuesday. At Motorco and Controlco, released manufacturing\norders were downloaded from MRP to the shopfloor nightly and three times daily, but\nweekly at Electrico. Despite the responsive nature of manufacturing planning systems\nat Motorco and Controlco, customer orders for products subject to FPp by-passed\nMRP.\nAt Motorco it had not been possible to set up the MRP system to process the\nproliferation of postponed modifications due to lack of flexibility in the BOMs.\nTherefore special instruction sheets were established to control modifications and\nassociated materials. Parts acquisition for modifications was cited as a laborious\nprocedure involving manual stock checks and hand written purchase requisitions.\nFrom a material control perspective, Motorco would have benefited from configurable\nBOMs.\nAt Controlco manufacturing orders subject to MTO were raised by sales,\nsimultaneously released to the factory three times per day. This ensured a maximum\ndelay of 8 hours between order creation and availability for manufacture. This was\nnot considered responsive enough for EPP keypad orders subject to FPp. Once\ncommunicated by EDI, these orders were logged on the manufacturing order system,\nhard copies printed and manually transferred to the shopfloor \u2013 1.5 hours from order\nreceipt to availability for manufacture.\n14\n3.3 Major Flaws in the Form Postponement Applications\nNone of the three FPp applications we studied was ideal. The application at Electrico\nwas so flawed that it was eventually abandoned. The application at Motorco incurred\nunnecessary manufacturing costs, although it was sustainable and offered benefits\ncompared with MTO. At Controlco the FPp application was not as originally\nenvisaged from the customer\u2019s sales forecast. The flaws in each of the FPp\napplications, a brief description of the ideal applications and the potential benefits are\ndiscussed in greater detail below.\n\uf0b7 Electrico: the manufacturing planning system was too inflexible to support the\nFPp application without the support of finished cable buffer stocks. There were\ntwo major shortfalls in the planning system: a planning time of two days and a\nMRP regeneration frequency of once per week. This added a potential six days\u2019\nwaiting time before new orders could be processed. In effect the planning lead-\ntime for FPp orders had not been reduced at all compared to that for orders subject\nto MTO. Instead Electrico\u2019s and their customer\u2019s planning systems were\nsynchronised but this did not take into account the customer\u2019s high level of\ndeviation from the manufacturing plan.\n\uf0b7 Motorco: all modifications involved removal of parts, resulting in increased\nmanufacturing time and costs. Almost half the motors modified required invasive\nmodifications involving changes to the magnet body components. This commonly\ninvolved a motor strip down which could take up to 3 working days. The CODP\nwould have better been located further upstream in the manufacturing process. A\nbetter location would have been at the balanced armature stage, since the armature\n15\nwas not subject to modifications. The magnet body assembly and final motor\nassembly would then be postponed (conducted to customer orders). With a\nmanufacturing lead-time of just 8 working days it would still have been possible to\nprovide modified standard motors on a 3 to 4 week lead-time. While this\napproach would not have reduced the number of generic SKUs, it would have\nreduced their value and increased their flexibility. This would have allowed\ngeneric ex-stock availability to be improved while reducing stock value.\n\uf0b7 Controlco: it was envisaged that the number of plastic keytip colour\nconfigurations on the EPP keypads would be limited to about five, and that only\nstocks of these generic keypad variants would be maintained. Only laser marking\nof the legend on the keytips would be performed to customer order: no component\nstocks would be required, and the keypads could be supplied on short lead-times.\nHowever, demand for EPP keypads was not as the customer forecasted. The EPP\nkeypad was demanded in eighteen - rather than five - different keytip colour\nconfigurations. This meant that Controlco had to locate the CODP further\nupstream than planned, and stock generic keypads (which weren\u2019t colour\nconfigured) together with the many variants of keytips. The implications for\nprocessing were that - rather than just laser marking - gluing and populating of the\nkeytips onto the keypads were also performed to customer order. Given the low\nvalue adding time (4.5 minutes) to total manufacturing lead-time of the\nunconfigured keypads it would have been possible for Controlco to assemble the\nkeypads entirely to order and only manufacture the keytips to stock. But\nControlco would then have lost the buffer stock of unconfigured keypads which\nprotected the generic keypad assembly process from the high demand variability.\n16\nGeneric keypad assembly \u2013 as well as gluing and populating - would then have\nrequired excess capacity.\n4 Analysing the Results against our Propositions\nWe listed our six propositions above in section 2 and summarised them in table 1.\nHere, we analyse our results against those six propositions.\n4.1 Demand profile\nResults from the three case studies against propositions P1 and P2 are listed in table 5.\nThey were tested and supported by all three case studies - with the exception of P1,\nwhich was challenged by findings from Electrico.\nTable 5: Cross-case comparison of the demand profile measures related to\npropositions P1 and P2.\nDemand mix, demand variability and volume demand: In the Electrico study both\ndemand mix and demand variability were lower - and volume demand was higher -\nfor cables made under FPp compared with those made under MTS. These unexpected\nfindings can be attributed to the FPp application being artificially restricted to one\ncustomer and further restricted to high volume cables (as described in section 3.2).\nTherefore these findings do not fundamentally challenge our propositions.\nAt Motorco and Controlco, demand mix and demand variability were higher - and\nvolume demand was lower - for products made under FPp compared with those made\nunder MTS. At Motorco, FPp motors were demanded in four times as many variants\nas MTS motors, so demand variability at finished motor level was higher and volume\ndemand was lower. Similarly at Controlco the EPP keypads subject to FPp were\ndemanded in seven times as many variants as MTS pushbutton bodies.\n17\nVolume demand at generic level: As predicted by P2, generic products selected for\nmanufacture under FPp exhibited higher volume demand than those which were MTO\nin all three cases. This was attributable to variations in the MTO generic product\nspecification that did not exist in the FPp generic product. At Electrico, 2 generic\ncables in the MTO UoA compared to 1 in the FPp UoA. At Motorco, there were 155\ngeneric motors in the ETO UoA compared to 24 generic motors in the FPp UoA. At\nControlco, there were 6 generic keypads in the MTO UoA compared to 3 in the FPp\nUoA.\n4.2 Customer Service and Demand Amplification\nOur research questions and respective propositions relating to customer service\nmeasures (ex-stock availability, order lead-time and delivery reliability) and demand\namplification are encompassed in propositions 3 and 4. Results from the three case\nstudies are summarised in table 6. Proposition P3 was not tested by either the\nElectrico or Motorco case studies. However it was tested at Controlco and our\nfindings supported P3. P4 was tested and supported by all three case studies with the\nexception of the delivery reliability findings from at Electrico, which challenged P4.\nEx-stock Availability: P3 remained untested at Electrico due to a lack of appropriate\ndata. This was also partially true of the Motorco study. However the principal reason\nfor proposition P3 not being tested at Motorco was that P3 pre-supposed that orders\nsubject to FPp and MTS did not pull from the same product stocks as they did at\nMotorco.\nTable 6: Cross-case comparison of customer service and demand amplification\npropositions P3 and P4.\n18\nAt Controlco ex-stock availability we measured the proportion of enquiries and orders\nfor which the correct stock item was available. For EPP keypads the combination of\nno stock outs (in the generic keypads), no enquiries (only firm orders) and a high\ndelivery performance (98% on time in full) indicated that ex-stock availability was\nabove 98%. Stock outs were recorded for three of the MTS pushbutton bodies and\nthis alone reduced delivery reliability to 94% on time in full. Further unlike the EPP\nkeypads pushbutton bodies were subject to enquiries for which the ex-stock\navailability was not recorded. Therefore it was concluded that ex-stock availability\nfor pushbutton bodies was at best 94%.\nAt Controlco the high ex-stock availability achieved by FPp compared with MTS was\nattributable to the reduced number of generic product SKUs and the accompanying\nreduction in demand variability.\nDelivery Reliability: Delivery reliability at Electrico achieved by FPp was lower than\nthat achieved by MTO \u2013 only 51% of FPp orders compared to 76% of MTO orders\nwere available OTIF. This challenged proposition P4. Reduced delivery reliability\nunder FPp was largely accounted for by 20% of orders that were only partially\navailable on the due date. Two possible explanations were advanced for poor delivery\nreliability under FPp: a lack of postponed sheathing capacity, and insufficient generic\ncable stock. The underlying cause of these factors was the unusual circumstances of\nthis case. The major customer of cables subject to FPp was allowed to call off\nfinished cables rather than have them delivered upon completion. Finished cable\n19\nstock provided a buffer against poor delivery reliability. Electrico would otherwise\nhave been forced to address poor delivery reliability.\nDelivery reliability at both Motorco and Controlco was higher for products subject to\nFPp than the MTO products. At Motorco, improvement in delivery reliability\nprovided by FPp was unexpectedly modest. There were three possible explanations:\n\uf0b7 quoted lead-times for the FPp motors often did not take into account availability of\nmodification parts.\n\uf0b7 limited resources in the Service and Repair section, where two thirds of the\nmodifications took place.\n\uf0b7 low generic motor stocks provided only 63% ex-stock availability .\nOrder Lead-time: In all three cases, order lead-times achieved under FPp were\nsubstantially less than that achieved under MTO, supporting proposition P4. This was\nin part because a significant proportion of manufacturing was conducted speculatively\nto stock rather than to order. Other factors contributed to the reduction in order lead-\ntime achieved by FPp.\n\uf0b7 Electrico: the order lead-time was just under half of that achieved by MTO. This\nwas partially due to synchronisation of the weekly manufacturing planning process\nat Electrico and customer.\n\uf0b7 Motorco: the order lead-time was less than a quarter of that achieved under ETO.\nThis was in part due to dramatic reductions in engineering and bought-in parts\nlead-times.\n20\n\uf0b7 Controlco: the order lead-time for EPP keypads (FPp) was one fifth of that\nachieved for MA keypads (MTO). This was double the responsiveness requested\nby customer, and was in part due to a more responsive approach to order\nprocessing and manufacturing planning.\nDemand amplification: In all three cases, demand amplification was not found for\nMTO or ETO, but was detected for FPp - supporting proposition P4. Demand\namplification was always detected in manufacture of generic product to stock, but not\nat the FPp stage. Exceptionally, demand amplification at Electrico was detected at the\norder-driven sheathing process \u2013 albeit to a lesser extent. This was attributable to the\nlong weekly planning cycle, which created the opportunity to batch similar customer\norders together.\n4.3 Product Design\nResults from the three case studies in relation to proposition P5 are summarised in\ntable 7. P5 was fully tested and fundamentally challenged by the product modularity\nfindings from all three studies.\nTable 7: Cross-case comparison of product modularity and standardization\nmeasures ( proposition P5).\nProduct Standardization: In all three cases, products subject to FPp demonstrated a\nhigher level of standardization than MTO or ETO. At Electrico and Motorco this was\nboth in terms of the proportion of common components and the degree of\ncommonality index. The commonality index exhibited under FPp was almost three\ntimes higher than that for MTO, and it was higher at every level in the BOM. At\nlower BOM levels, this was due to FPp being applied to fewer generic products than\n21\nMTO or ETO. At higher BOM levels relating to postponed processes, high\ncommonality occurred for different reasons. At Electrico it was due to limitation of\nFPp to one customer which enabled standardization of packaging components and\nlimited the range of sheathing compounds. At Motorco it was simply due to customer\nrequirement for less variety in peripheral components of motors subject to FPp.\nAt Controlco a much greater proportion of EPP keypad components was common to\nall variants than MA keypad components (48% compared with 3%) and this was due\nto a single generic body design serving the full range of EPP keypads. Unexpectedly,\nEPP and MA keypads exhibited a very similar degree of commonality index overall \u2013\n14% compared with 15% respectively. However the source of commonality was quite\ndifferent \u2013 commonality in the generic keypad was higher for EPP keypads whereas\ncommonality in the keytips (the configuring components) was higher for MA\nkeypads.\nProduct Modularity: In all three cases the degree of modularity exhibited by\nproducts subject to FPp was the same as that exhibited by products subject to\nMTO\/ETO. The distinction in modularity was between customising components\n(supplied to the postponed process) and components in the generic product.\nCustomising components required by all three products subject to FPp were highly\nmodular, with the exception of some of the components required for Motorco motor\nmodifications. Components in the generic products exhibited a lower degree of\nmodularity (with the exception of the cables at Electrico which were highly modular\nthroughout).\n22\nDegree of modularity demonstrated by all products was an incidental characteristic\nrather than the result of a deliberate product design effort. This even applied to the\nEPP keypad, which was the only product specifically designed for FPp.\n4.4 Excess Capacity and Throughput Efficiency\nResults for proposition P6 are summarised in table 8. P6 was fully tested in the\nMotorco and Controlco case studies, but only in part in the Electrico case - where it\nwas challenged by the excess capacity findings. P6 was fully supported at Motorco\nbut was challenged by throughput efficiency findings at Controlco.\nTable 8: Cross-case comparison of the excess capacity and throughput efficiency\nmeasures (proposition P6).\nExcess Capacity: In both Motorco and Controlco cases, excess capacity at the\npostponed processes (as indicated by low utilisation and high design capacity levels)\nwas higher than at preceding stock-driven processes - supporting P6. At Motorco the\nfinal assembly cell (where a third of the postponed motor modifications took place)\nconsistently demonstrated lower utilisation levels than any of the preceding cells. At\nControlco, average capacity utilisation was significantly lower for the EPP keypad\nconfiguration cell than the stock-driven EPP assembly cell.\nAt Electrico, the postponed sheathing process consistently exhibited the least excess\ncapacity compared to the preceding processes - challenging P6. This was attributable\nto the provision of less capacity at the postponed process, due to the unusual\ncircumstances at Electrico. Lack of sheathing capacity contributed to poor delivery\nreliability achieved by FPp (which itself challenged P4) and would have been\naddressed had it not been for the buffer of finished cable stocks (see above).\n23\nThroughput Efficiency: P6 was not tested with respect to throughput efficiency at\nElectrico because it was not possible to take this measure for the postponed process.\nAt Controlco, throughput efficiency was higher for the stock driven, generic EPP\nkeypad assembly than it was for the postponed configuration - 27% compared to\n11%. This challenged P6, although manufacturing lead-times for the postponed\nconfiguration were shorter than for the generic keypad assembly process - 3 compared\nto 17.5 working days respectively. There were two explanations for the low\nthroughput efficiency we found at the postponed configuration process:\n\uf0b7 high generic keypad stock targets - equivalent to 4 weeks cover \u2013 encouraged\nlarge generic keypad stock replenishment orders. These were much greater than\nthe size of the customer orders for configured keypads - 520 compared with 45\nrespectively.\n\uf0b7 at the postponed configuration process queuing caused by capacity restrictions\nextended the manufacturing lead-time by over 500%.\nThese problems were due to flaws in the FPp application at Controlco. High generic\nstock levels ensured that the stock driven generic processing was far from the \u2018lean\u2019\nideal and the postponed keypad configuration process demonstrated a lack of\nresponsiveness. However, greater responsiveness was not required as FPp already\nprovided double the responsiveness requested by customer.\nFindings from Motorco supported P6. Throughput efficiency for postponed\nmodifications was, on average, double that achieved by stock-driven manufacture of\ngeneric stock motors (21% compared to 10%). However, as at Controlco, throughput\nefficiency measured for the postponed process was highly variable from order to order\n24\n(four times that for generic motor manufacture). Variability in throughput efficiency\nwas mainly driven by the variety of modifications - which required anything from 10\nminutes to 26 working hours.\nAt both Controlco and Motorco, the most striking difference between generic product\nmanufacture and the postponed processes was not throughput efficiencies but\nmanufacturing lead-times. Postponed processes were clearly more responsive with a\nmanufacturing lead-time equivalent to only 18% of the generic product manufacturing\nlead-times.\n4.5 Production Variety\nAt Electrico and Controlco the number of SKUs at the CODP was greater than the\nnumber of finished product variants demanded - eight SKUs compared to five\nfinished cables at Electrico and 179 SKUs compared to 72 finished keypads at\nControlco (figure 1). This is contrary to the original conceptual model of FPp which\npredicted the number of SKUs at the CODP to be substantially less than the number\nof finished items.\nFigure 1: Production variety funnels for Controlco\u2019s products where EPP\nkeypads are subject to FPp\nIn both cases this situation was not a feature of the duration of the study but a feature\nof the product. At Electrico even if FPp had not been restricted to one customer this\nsituation would have persisted because for every new finished cable variant a new\nsheathing polymer was likely to be required. At Controlco, although the theoretical\npotential number of finished EPP keypads was much greater than 72, this product was\n25\nsupplied exclusively to one customer and therefore the actual number of finished\nitems was unlikely to change significantly.\nAt Motorco, 24 generic motors were stocked and 51 different components were\nsupplied into the postponed process, but the number of SKUs at the CODP was less\nthan the 56 finished motor variants demanded. This was attributable to the fact that\nmany of the components were purchased (or made) to customer order. This was\npossible because there was a sufficient order lead-time during which to do this and\nnecessary because the finished motors were truly customised therefore the\ncustomising components were not predictable.\n5 Frameworks for Application of Form Postponement\nNone of the FPp applications was ideal, and this created anomalies in the findings.\nThe FPp application in the initial study at Electrico was flawed to the extent that after\nnine months it could no longer be defined as FPp. At Motorco the FPp application\nwas sustainable, but the customising process involved the removal of previously\nadded components. Finally the FPp application at Controlco most closely resembled\nan \u2018ideal\u2019 application - but was not the planned ideal application!\nAnomalies in our findings resulted in a number of hypotheses being challenged \u2013 we\ndid not find predicted results, but for predictable reasons. Our propositions were\nbased on ideal FPp applications, so some of them were challenged when tested in less\nthan ideal applications. When the complete picture was built up of how FPp was\napplied in each case, challenges to our propositions were understandable and\npredictable. Yin (2003) refers to this as \u2018theoretical replication\u2019. \u2018Literal replication\u2019\nwas sought where results were predicted to be similar for each case.\n26\nAnomalies in the findings revealed important links between poor delivery reliability\nand lack of excess capacity at the postponed process, and suggested that in practice\nthroughput efficiency is not a crucial measure. Taking these into account, our\npropositions remain largely unscathed - except for that regarding product modularity,\nwhich was fundamentally challenged by each study.\nThis section describes the two frameworks, based on the propositions and the original\nconceptual model, that were developed from these studies. We also summarise\nobstacles to applying FPp\n5.1 Inventory Management Decision Framework\nThe inventory management decision framework shown in table 9 shows when FPp is\na viable alternative to either MTS or MTO on the basis of demand profile (at generic\nand end item level), customer service and demand amplification.\nTable 9: Inventory Management Decision Framework for Unicentric FPp.\nOpportunities for applying FPp to MTO products depends on the demand profile at\ngeneric level. Generic product variants which are subject to low demand variability\nand high volume demand (as in Electrico and Controlco cases). Otherwise, it may be\npossible to re-design the product through process and component standardization to\ncreate a narrow range of generic products demanded in sufficient volumes for\napplication of FPp.\nA key incentive for applying FPp to MTO products is the possibility of improving\ndelivery reliability and significantly reducing order lead-times. A more responsive\nproduct supply may be needed to improve competitiveness. Introduction of FPp will\n27\nimpact suppliers, who should be able to manage the levels of demand amplification\nlikely to be introduced.\nOpportunities for applying FPp to MTS products depend on the demand profile for the\nfinished products, and are indicated by inaccurate sales forecasting, stock outs and\nexcessive stocks. These products exhibit high product mix (or potentially high\nproduct mix), high demand variability and low volume demand at end item level.\nRedesign of MTS products may be necessary to establish a narrow range of generic\nproducts demanded in sufficient volumes to enable application of FPp.\nIncentives for applying FPp to MTS products include the possibility of improving ex-\nstock availability. Stock-outs may be critical and not tolerated by customer, as at\nControlco. Further risks are associated with inflexible finished stock levels, such as\nobsolescence. Demand amplification should be reduced on components supplied to\nthe postponed process, enabling a more sufficient supply. But postponed processes\nmust not extend the order lead-time beyond that acceptable to customer.\nOur framework has some limitations:\n\uf0b7 tt considers only \u2018unicentric\u2019 FPp - where the postponed processes take place\nin the same location as generic processes. Therefore distribution is not\nconsidered.\n\uf0b7 demand profiles at generic level can be changed either by relocating the\nCODP or re-designing product and processes.\n\uf0b7 product value is not considered. If this is particularly high it will tend to\ndiscourage stock-driven processing and if it is low it will tend to have the\nopposite effect.\n28\n5.2 Framework for the Application of Form Postponement\nOur main contribution is the practical implications of applying FPp within a\nmanufacturing facility. We propose a framework which provides practical guidance\non how FPp can be applied - in terms of product design, inventory management,\nmanufacturing planning and scheduling operations.\nWe have revised our original conceptual model of FPp (Skipworth and Harrison,\n2004) to take account our empirical findings. Our new framework applies to\n\u2018unicentric\u2019 FPp applications, where the product exhibits component swapping\nmodularity. Our framework illustrates major operational implications of applying\nFPp which are described in this section.\nWhere products exhibit component swapping modularity, the number of SKUs at the\nCODP could be greater than the number of finished product variants, contrary to our\noriginal conceptual model of FPp. However our studies have shown that there are still\nbenefits to be gained from FPp over MTS. The PVF in our new framework shown in\nfigure 2 illustrates that, although the number of generic products at the CODP is\nalways small compared to the number of finished product items, the total number of\ncomponents supplied into the postponed process may not be. This applied to all three\nstudies, and at Electrico and Controlco the total number of SKUs at the CODP was\ngreater than the number of finished product items.\nThe key benefit of FPp is that it improves the flexibility of stocks by keeping them in\ngeneric form at the CODP, rather than committed as in MTS. This enables safety\nstocks to be reduced whilst offering the full range of finished items.\n29\nFigure 2: Framework for the application of FPp.\nLocating the CODP: The CODP should be located at a \u2018neck\u2019 in the Production\nVariety Funnel (figure 2). This is typically at the generic product stage such that:\n\uf0b7 no previously added value should be removed during the postponed process.\nThere must be no removal of components or rework.\n\uf0b7 postponed value added processing time must be short compared to the total\nvalue adding process time required to manufacture the product\n\uf0b7 the number of generic product variants must be kept to a minimum. Each\nvariant should be subject to high volume demand and low volume demand\nvariability (CV) relative to the end items.\nOur findings should be contrasted with some of the rules for locating the CODP that\nhave appeared in the literature. An example is that \u2018postponement is about delaying\nthe activities (as to the form and\/or place of goods) until the latest possible point in\ntime\u2019 (Yang et al, 2004a). This is based on the view that short order lead times are\nparamount, and ignores the trade-off between order lead time, number of SKUs,\ndemand variability and safety stocks required. For a high variety product, it is\nproblematic to place the decoupling point to allow immediate delivery without\nmaintaining high level stocks: the advantages of postponement would be\ncorrespondingly reduced.\nProduct Design: A high proportion of the product should be standardised whilst\nensuring that the required customisation levels can still be achieved. Standardization\nthat involves material redundancy should be avoided where possible. Remaining\ndifferentiations should be postponed.\n30\nIdeally components supplied to the postponed process should be highly modular, so\nthat:\n\uf0b7 a one-to-one correspondence exists between each functional element and physical\ncomponent (or module)\n\uf0b7 interactions between components are critical to functioning of the system.\nTherefore it should be possible to combine components in many ways to support a\nwide product range.\nInventory Management: we identified five conditions for order processing and\ninventory control:\n\uf0b7 EDI is a rapid and reliable way of transmitting customer orders, particularly\nwhen electronic data such as bar codes are required. However EDI is only\npractical when the customer places orders at regular intervals. Further the\nimproved responsiveness offered by EDI transmission of orders can best be\nrealised if orders are processed upon arrival. If these conditions do not apply\nand orders can be placed anytime then some type of broadcasting mechanism\nmust be deployed for the orders upon receipt. This could involve kanbans\nfaxed (\u2018faxban\u2019) by the customer.\n\uf0b7 Generic product stock level should provide forward cover that takes into\naccount volume demand variability (measured by CV) at this level.\n\uf0b7 If demand for the generic products and components is sufficiently stable they\ncan be supplied to the postponed process under Kanban control. This was the\ncase for the keytips at Controlco.\n\uf0b7 Components at the postponed process must be available on a short enough\nlead-time. In practice this implies that components are available ex-stock.\nHowever this is not possible when a product is truly customised since the\n31\ncustomising components cannot be predefined (as at Motorco). In this case it\nmust be ensured that suppliers can deliver to order on a suficiently short lead-\ntime. This is often not possible and leads to FPp being limited to a set of\npredefined end items (as at Electrico and Controlco).\n\uf0b7 Generally standard quoted lead-times which apply to all orders are only\npossible where FPp is applied to a predefined set of end items (as at Electrico\nand Controlco). Where products are truly customised quoted lead-times must\ndepend on component availability and are therefore variable, as the Motorco\ncase demonstrated.\nManufacturing Planning and Control: we identified four conditions for\nmanufacturing planning systems and capacity management:\n\uf0b7 The order processing and manufacturing planning systems for the postponed\nprocess must be highly responsive. This often requires a real time planning\nsystem \u2013 a fixed period MRP system for the postponed processing does not\nsupport FPp applications for two reasons. Firstly the order processing time\nfrom order logging to availability for manufacture tends not to be short\nenough, in part due to the regeneration frequency of fixed period MRP\nsystems. Secondly fixed period MRP systems restrict due dates to typically\nweekly time buckets. Only in the Electrico case was a fixed period MRP\nsystem used for the finished product and the failure of FPp, in this case, was\nmainly attributable to this.\n\uf0b7 Where the postponed process is more complex and especially where the\nproduct is truly customised (Motorco) an MRP system may be desirable.\nConfigurable BOMs will be required so that any potential finished product\nBOM can be quickly established for an order.\n\uf0b7 Substantial excess capacity should be provided at the postponed process to\nenable it to remain responsive when subjected to high demand variability in\nterms of product mix, and to a lesser extent volume (i.e. demand variability at\n32\ngeneric level). Delivery reliability can suffer when sufficient excess capacity\nis not provided (as at Electrico and Motorco).\n\uf0b7 Throughput efficiency is not the crucial issue at the postponed process - it\ntends to be highly variable. Rather it is important to ensure that manufacturing\nlead-times are sufficiently short to meet customer required order lead-times.\nThis may imply limitations to the quantities or customisations that can be\ndelivered within standard quoted lead-times for FPp.\n5.3 Obstacles to the application of FPp\nProduct design: The aim is to standardize the product to provide few generic\nproducts and to modularise customizing components. This is dependant on the\ndemand profile as well as on product characteristics. At Controlco the demand profile\nmade it impossible to standardize the colour configured keypad. But by moving the\nCODP upstream, a more standardized generic product was identified. At Motorco the\ngeneric motor was demanded in 24 variants and even moving the CODP upstream\nwould not reduce this number.\nManufacturing Planning and Control: mindsets associated with MTO and MTS are\ninhibitors to FPp, an aspect of the lack of structural and cultural fit referred to by\nYang et al (2004b). MTO and MTS tend not to require either manufacturing planning\nor manufacturing processes to be responsive compared with FPp.\nAll three cases demonstrated that legacy order processing and manufacturing planning\nsystems are inhibitors to FPp applications. At both Electrico and Controlco, the fixed\nperiod MRP systems were insufficiently responsive to process customer orders for\nFPp products. At Motorco, the MRP system was responsive enough, but the BOMs\nlacked flexibility.\n33\nPostponed Process Capacity: when this is insufficient to maintain the required\nresponsiveness in terms of short, reliable lead-times it presents an obstacle to the\napplication of FPp. At Electrico, lack of buffer capacity at the postponed process\ncontributed to reduced delivery reliability provided by FPp compared to MTO. At\nMotorco, lack of resource and focus in the department performing postponed\nmodifications was a strong contributing factor to poor delivery performance.\n6 Conclusions\nOur research shows the conditions under which FPp is preferred to MTO or MTS.\n\uf0b7 When there is a need for greater responsiveness, in terms of shorter order lead-\ntimes, than MTO can deliver.\n\uf0b7 When sales forecasts for MTS finished products are very inaccurate, and re-\npositioning the stock further upstream where it is more flexible reduces inventory\nmanagement risks.\nBased on the evidence from our three case studies, the ideal application of FPp\nremains elusive. This is related to the major operational challenges involved in its\napplication. This begs the question \u2018would efforts be better invested in improving the\nexisting MTO and MTS approaches?\u2019 We consider each case in turn.\n\uf0b7 Motorco: finished motor specifications subject to FPp were not predefined.\nInstead the motors were truly customised. Therefore MTS was not an option\nbecause it was not possible to predict and stock the full array of finished motors.\nMTO on the other hand would not have enabled the motors to be delivered within\nthe 3 to 4 weeks lead-time expected by UK customers (for modified standard\nmotors) - the best achievable by MTO was 6 to 10 weeks depending on motor size.\n34\nSo if Motorco wanted to sell modified standard motors to UK customers, the only\noption was FPp.\n\uf0b7 Controlco: FPp was applied to a set of predefined finished product variants, so\nMTS was an option. However this would have required very high finished stock\nlevels to ensure stock availability in the face of such high demand variability.\nMoreover the customer did not need immediate availability and was satisfied with\na 5 working day lead-time. MTO on the other hand was not a possibility because\nkeytip manufacture involved numerous distinct processes, and a high minimum\nbatch quantity, resulting in a long manufacturing lead-time. Applying FPp by\nmaking at least the keytips to a speculative stock was the only approach that\nminimised inventory whilst enabling the customer service need to be met.\n\uf0b7 Electrico: if the difficulties with the manufacturing planning and scheduling\nsystem had been overcome, substantial benefits could have been realised. Design\nof the majority of Electrico\u2019s cables was ideal for FPp and presented no obstacles.\nThe MTO lead-time of 3 weeks could have been cut to 3 days, enabling cable\nsupply to be matched with customer demand and all finished stocks eliminated.\nThis would have provided Electrico with the ability to provide exceptionally\nresponsive service without the need for high value finished goods stock.\nOur study shows that even flawed FPp applications offer significant benefits, and are\nworth undertaking. So is it worth going the extra mile and applying FPp in an ideal\nway? In the Motorco case, improvements in the FPp application would have\ndelivered reductions in manufacturing costs and improvements in delivery reliability\nwithout reducing responsiveness or increasing inventory costs. At Controlco, FPp\n35\nwas already providing double the responsiveness requested by the customer and\ndelivery reliability was very high: there were no further advantages to be gained\nthrough improvements in customer service.\nImprovements in a FPp application are subject to the same criteria as other operations\nimprovements \u2013 they are worth implementing if they deliver either reductions in\nmanufacturing costs or improvements in customer service that will provide\ncompetitive advantage.\nAcknowledgement\nWe acknowledge the financial support provided by the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council (EPSRC) in conducting this project.\n36\n7 References\nBICHENO, J., 1998, The Lean Toolbox (Buckingham, England: Picsie Books)\nCOLLIER, D.A., 1981, The Measure and Operating Benefits of Component Part\nCommonality.
