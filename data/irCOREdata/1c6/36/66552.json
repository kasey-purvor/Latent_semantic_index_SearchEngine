Introduction \n \nAlong the coast of much of the southern North Sea and English Channel, beds of peat \nattained their maximum thickness (typically between 1 m and 3 m) and lateral extent \n(up to c. 100 km2) during the mid Holocene.  During the late Holocene almost all of \nthese peatlands were destroyed by marine flooding and they now lie buried beneath 1 \nto 4 m of minerogenic sediment.  Several driving mechanisms have been proposed to \nexplain this inundation. One suggestion is that there was a rise in relative sea level \n(RSL), a second that there was an increase in sediment delivery from terrigenous \nsources caused by prehistoric landscape disturbance (Smyth and Jennings, 1988; \nPlater et al., 1999).  A third suggestion is that sediment exhaustion caused coastal \nerosion and the re-entrance of tidal systems (Beets et al., 1994).  A fourth proposal is \nthe drainage of the late Holocene wetlands, either by tidal creek extension or by \nwatertable lowering, made them vulnerable to tidal flooding (Roep and van Regteren \nAltena, 1988; Beets et al., 1992; Baeteman and Denys, 1995; Baeteman et al., 2002; \nBaeteman, in press).  Finally, Long et al. (2000) argue that the generally slow rate of \nlate Holocene RSL rise (typically <1 mm a-1) meant that conditions for organic \naccumulation and preservation were poor.   \n \nIn this paper we explore the role of peat compaction on the destruction and deep \nburial by mineral sediments of a late Holocene coastal wetland in the Rye area of \nRomney Marsh, a large coastal lowland in the eastern English Channel.  The process \nof compaction, which lowers the sediment surface relative to the tidal frame, has the \neffect of creating significant accommodation space that is additional to that provided \n 3\nby any RSL rise.  In the example detailed here, this accommodation space was rapidly \nfilled by heterolithic tidal rhythmites. \n \n2.  Sediment compaction \n \nSediment compaction deforms the entire stratigraphic column in a complex manner.  \nHighly compressible peat generally compacts more than almost incompressible \ngravels and sands, with the actual amount of compaction influenced by the thickness \nand composition of the sediments, their proximity to incompressible bedrock strata, \ntheir time since deposition, and their initial water content (Tooley, 1978; Bennema et \nal., 1954; Skempton, 1970; Hobbs, 1986; Paul and Barras, 1998; Pizzuto and \nSchwendt, 1997; Allen, 1999, 2000).  Compaction is, therefore, a contaminant of \nalmost all studies of vertical sea-level change that involve peat, lowering index points \nfrom their original elevation and causing much of the scatter observed in RSL graphs.   \n \nFrom a palaeogeographic perspective, sediment compaction (including peat as well as \nunderlying minerogenic sediments) complicates efforts to reconstruct the geometry of \nformer land surfaces that often undulate by several metres despite being of broadly \nsimilar age (e.g. Waller, 1994a; Haslett et al., 1998; Bell et al., 1999; Streif, 1972).   \nMoreover, the process of compaction contributes directly to the dynamics of \nlandscape change by lowering the height of a sediment surface relative to the tidal \nframe and thus encouraging tidal inundation, independent of any absolute change in \nsea level.  This is an active process that, like the better studied changes in ocean \nvolume and crustal motions, can exert a profound influence on the height of the land \nrelative to the sea. \n 4\n3.  Aims \n \nIn this paper we explore the role of peat compaction in controlling landscape and sea-\nlevel change on Romney Marsh.  We have three aims: \n \n1. To present litho-, bio- and chronostratigraphic data from a site, West \nWinchelsea, that documents the late Holocene submergence of a regionally \nextensive peat bed. \n2. To examine the compaction-induced distortion of this peat surface in the Rye \narea and across the Romney Marsh depositional complex more widely. \n3. To explore the significance of this compaction for reconstructing the late \nHolocene RSL and coastal evolution. \n \n4.  Regional setting and previous work \n \nThe Romney Marsh depositional complex is a large coastal lowland located in the \neastern English Channel, and includes the gravel and sand beaches Dungeness \nForeland and Romney Marsh and Walland Marsh (Figure 1).  These marshes are \nformed by c. 25 m of unconsolidated sediment, most of which is Holocene in age.  An \nexample of the full Holocene sedimentary sequence in the vicinity of Rye, in the \nsouthwest of the complex, is provided in Figure 2.  A prominent element of the \nstratigraphic architecture of these sediments is a laterally extensive bed of peat \n(Green\u2019s (1968) \u201cmain marsh peat\u201d).  Across Walland and Romney Marsh this peat \noverlies marine sediments that accumulated in intertidal sand- and mudflats as well as \n 5\ntidal channels (Waller et al., 1988; Tooley and Switsur, 1988; Long and Innes, 1995; \nLong et al., 1996; Long, A. et al., 1998).   \n \nThe main marsh peat varies in composition.  In the valleys of the Brede, Tillingham, \nPannel and Rother, and also in the north of Walland Marsh between Horsemarsh \nSewer and Snargate (Figure 1), it is dominated by alder carr deposits and contains \nabundant detrital wood remains (Waller et al., 1988; Tooley and Switsur, 1988; \nWaller et al., 1999).  Across southwest Walland Marsh, Sphagnum macrofossils are \ncommon within the peat and indicate the former presence of a large raised bog (Long \nand Innes, 1995; Waller et al., 1999; Waller, 2002).  This bog formed a physical \nbarrier that, for part of the late Holocene, separated the south-western part of Walland \nMarsh (including the Rye area) from areas to the east.  In addition, on the margins of \nDungeness Foreland, between the gravel and sand beach ridges, are thin (typically <1 \nm) shallow-water reedswamp peats (e.g. Tooley and Switsur, 1988; Spencer et al., \n1998; Long and Hughes, 1995).   \n \n 6\nIsle of Oxney\nDenge\nBeach\nDenge\nMarsh\nW a l l a n d  M a r s h\nR o m n e y  M a r s h\nLydd\nNew Romney\nSnargateAppledore\nRye Harbour\nWinchelsea\nRye\nOld Romney\nDungeness\nForeland\nPeasmarsh\nLea Farm\nGuldeford\nRoadend\nCadborough\nGreyfriars\nPett Level\nHoughton\nGreen\nWest Winchelsea\nPewis Marsh\nn Little Cheyne Court\nn Scotney\nn Dowels\nn Brede Bridge\nn Pannel Farm\nn Hope Farm\nn Romney 18\nn Romney 7\nn Brookland\nn Midley Church\nn Horsemarsh Sewer\nn Chapel Bank\nn Rye 27\nn\nRye 31\nn Rye 33a\nn Tishy's Sewer\n0\u00b040'E 0\u00b045' 0\u00b050' 0\u00b055' 1\u00b000'\n51\u00b005'\n51\u00b000'\n50\u00b055'\nkilometres0 5\nR.

Location map showing the Rye study area and the Romney Marsh depositional complex. \n \nThe main marsh peat began to form after c. 6000 cal. yr BP in the valleys that drain \ninto the west of the study area.  The rate of RSL rise slowed during the mid Holocene \nand at the same time the coastal barrier of Dungeness Foreland grew to provide \nprotection for the freshwater peat-forming communities that expanded to reach their \n 7\nmaximum extent c. 3200 cal. yr BP (Long, A. et al., 1998).  The timing of the late \nHolocene inundation of the main marsh peat is difficult to establish.  Long et al. \n(1998) suggest that the peat was inundated first on Romney Marsh, after c. 3200 cal. \nyr BP, with Walland Marsh being completely submerged by c. 1700 cal. yr BP.  \nHowever, this chronology is not entirely reliable because ages from the surface of the \npeat do not necessarily date when deposition of the overlying clastic sediments \noccurred.  The rate of vertical peat accumulation slowed significantly during the late \nHolocene and this largely caused the deposition of organic material to cease away \nfrom the raised bog, while the oxidation and erosion of the upper surface of the peat \nmay have caused the loss of peat via wastage (Waller et al., 1988).   \n \n 8\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL L\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nR .\nP an\nne\nl\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nn 27\nn\n31\nn 33a\nn 29\nn 20\nn15\nn\n11\nn\n14n\n13n12\nn\n17\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\n-25\n-30\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 9000\nDistance (metres)\nAl\ntit\nud\ne \n(m\netr\nes\n O\nD)\n11 15 27 31 3312 13 14 17 20 29\n5590\n\u00b170\n1740\n\u00b160 4550\u00b180\n2980\n\u00b160\n6940\n\u00b160\n0\u00b040'E 0\u00b045'\n51\u00b000'\n50\u00b055'\nkilometres0 2\nR.

The main marsh peat occurs between c. 0 and _ 4 m OD. The peat has been eroded between \ncore 14 and core 20, probably during breaching of the Rye barrier beach during the storms of the 13th century (from Long et al., \n1996). \n \n 9\nHistorical records document a major change in coastal configuration that occurred in \nthe medieval period, when a series of large storms in AD 1250, 1252, and particularly \n1287 and 1288, breached the south coast near Rye (Eddison, 1998).  This was \naccompanied by widespread erosion of the marsh sediments in the immediate vicinity \nof the initial breach, and the creation of two large tidal inlets known as the Wainway \nChannel and the Rother Estuary.  The area flooded was extensive on Walland Marsh, \nreaching as far north as Appledore and a line of sea walls known as the \u201cgreat cordon\u201d \n(Eddison and Draper, 1997).  Over time, this breach was healed by the regrowth of the \nsand and gravel beaches and the progressive reclamation of the former tidal channels \nand salt marshes during the 14th to 16th centuries (Gardiner, 1995; Eddison, 1998; \nGardiner, 2002). \n \n5.  Methods \n \nAs part of a wider study into the Holocene history of the Rye area (Long et al., 2004; \nWaller and Schofield, in press; Waller et al., in press), we collected stratigraphic data \nfrom 10 field sites (Figure 1) using a hand-operated gouge auger, and retrieved \nsample cores with a \u201cRussian\u201d or mechanically operated piston corer.  One site, West \nWinchelsea (core 3), was sampled for pollen, foraminifera, grain size, laminae counts \nand radiocarbon dating of the peat, with a duplicate core sampled for radiocarbon \ndating of plant macrofossils from Unit 2 (see below).  Note that there are slight depth \ndifferences between the two cores, although the stratigraphy is identical.  Our primary \nfocus was on the nature of the upper levels of the peat and the overlying clastic \nsediments.  Previously collected deep boreholes provide information regarding the \n 10\noverall sediment depth and composition (e.g. Figure 2).  All cores were levelled to \nOrdnance Datum (OD = mean sea-level) using a level and staff. \n \nSamples for grain size analysis were digested in H2O2 in a hot water bath for 2 to 4 \nhours and washed and centrifuged to remove the H2O2.  We added 0.2 mg of an \naqueous solution of sodium hexametaphosphate to help disperse the sample, which \nwas examined using a Coulter LS 230 laser granulometer with polarization intensity \ndifferential scattering.  Heterolithic tidal rhythmites comprise thin intercalated layers \nof sand and mud which may be wavy, flaser or lenticular bedded (Archer et al., 1995; \nArcher, 1998).  Silty tidal rhythmites may develop where mud is dominant, \ncomprising of thin, planar laminated silts, with clay drapes.  In heterolithic tidal \nrhythmites it is the coarser, sandy layers which record the higher resolution record of \ntidal periodicities (Dalrymple et al., 1991).  We measured the thickness of sand and \nmud laminations using a x40 binocular microscope, mounted over a moving stage \ncontrolled by a micrometer.  Layer thickness was adjusted for linear compression \nbefore Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectral analysis and more straightforward \ngraphical techniques were applied to the resultant time series, using SPSS and Excel, \nin an attempt to break down the complex cycles of layer thickness into their \nconstituent sinusoids (e.g. Martino and Sanderson, 1993; Archer, 1994).  \nPeriodograms generated by the FFT were smoothed using a Tukey-Hamming \nwindow, with a span of five data points, to create spectral density plots.   \n \nPollen analyses followed standard techniques and are described in Waller et al. (in \npress).  Samples for foraminiferal analysis were wet-sieved at 63\u00b5 and examined \nunder a binocular microscope.  Foraminiferal identification and classification follows \n 11\n 12\nthat of Murray (1971, 1979) and Loeblich and Tappan (1988).  The microfossil data \nare plotted using the Tilia and Tilia* Graph packages, with cluster analysis performed \nusing the CONISS package (Grimm, 1987, 1993).  Radiocarbon dates (Table 1) \ninclude both bulk and AMS analyses. \n \n6.  Results \n \nOf the new field sites studied, we select West Winchelsea for detailed analysis in this \npaper.  This is because the site stratigraphy is the most complete and is representative \nof sediments across much of the Rye area.  West Winchselsea is located on the valley \nfloor of the Brede valley, approximately 1 km west of the town of Winchelsea (Figure \n3).   \n \n6.1 Lithostratigraphy \n \nThe stratigraphy at West Winchelsea defines the margin of a former tidal channel, \nwith peat preserved to the south of the study site and thick sequences of laminated \nchannel sediments towards the north.  The \u201cmain marsh peat\u201d is restricted to cores 7, \n5 and 3 (Figure 3).  We only recovered the upper 38 cm of this deposit, although \nprevious cores show the peat to be between 2 and 3 m thick in the West Winchelsea \narea (Waller et al., 1988; Long et al., 1996).  Elsewhere, coarse tidal channel sands \nfine upwards into a well laminated sand silt, which passes (above c. 1 m OD) into an \niron-stained silt clay that extends to the present surface.  Where peat is present we \ndefined four main lithostratigraphic units in the field:  \n \nTable 1. \nRadiocarbon dates from transgressive and regressive contacts of mid and late Holocene age in the Rye area and the Romney Marsh depositional complex.

The upper contact of the peat varies between -1.84 \nand -2.29 m OD and is generally sharp, but not obviously erosive. \n \nUnit 2 (clay\/silt): Above the peat is a grey clay-silt that contains abundant remains of \nin situ plant roots.  This unit is thickest in core 3 (c. 1.80 m) and thinnest in core 7 (c. \n0.10 m).   \n \nUnit 3 (laminated sands and silts): This is a thick deposit (c. 1 to 3 m) of grey, well-\nlaminated sands and silts.  In boreholes closest to the Brede, where Units 1 and 2 are \nmissing, these sediments are black and water saturated below c. -2.50 m OD.   \n \nUnit 4 (iron-stained silt clay): The uppermost unit in most cores, above c. 1.10 m OD, \nis a silt clay that is weakly laminated and contains rare rootlets.  The unit is orange-\nbrown in colour due to the presence of iron-staining.  \n \n 18\n6.2 Pollen analysis \n \nSamples for pollen were taken from the uppermost levels of the peat and the \nimmediately overlying organic clay (Units 1 and 2 from core 3) (Figure 4).

Three textural zones (Table 3) can be identified from the mean \nparticle size data (Figure 6a), modal particle size (not shown) and the percentage \nsand-silt-clay plot (Figure 6b). These zones do not coincide with the lithologic \nboundaries defined in the field (Section 6.1 above).  This is because of the general \nhomogeneity of the sediment (a sandy mud) which undergoes continuous and subtle \nchanges up-core.  It also reflects the fact that field logging was influenced largely by \nchanges in the character of the laminations \u2013 particularly frequency and thickness - \nrather than any marked change in texture. \n \n 21\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\nL\n514\n492\n494\n496\n498\n500\n502\n504\n506\n508\n510\n512\n20 20 40 20 20 20 20 40 20 20 20 60 100 4080\n14C yr BP\n1348\u00b127\n(1307 -1186\ncal. yr BP)\nWW-3\nWW-2\nWW-1\nPollen sum = % TLP % TLP + Aq % TLP + Pterid\nLPAZB\net\nul\na\nLi\nho\nlo\ngy\nDe\npt\nh \n(cm\n)\nPi\nnu\ns \nsy\nlve\nst\nris\nUl\nm\nus\nQu\ner\ncu\ns\nTi\nlia\nAl\nnu\ns \nglu\ntin\nos\na\nFr\nax\nin\nus\n \nex\nce\nlsi\nor\nCa\nrp\nin\nus\n \nbe\ntu\nlu\ns\nFa\ngu\ns \nsy\nlva\ntic\na\nAc\ner\nCo\nry\nlu\ns \nav\nel\nla\nna\n-\ntyp\ne\nIle\nx \naq\nui\nfo\nliu\nm\nRh\nam\nnu\ns \nca\nth\nar\ntic\na\nFr\nan\ngu\nla\n \nal\nnu\ns\nSo\nrb\nus\n-\ntyp\ne\nHe\nde\nra\n \nhe\nlix\nSa\nlix\nRa\nnu\nnc\nul\nus\n \nac\nris\n-\ntyp\ne\nUr\ntic\nac\nea\ne\nMy\nric\na \nga\nle\nCh\nen\nop\nod\nice\nae\nSp\ner\ngu\nla\n-\ntyp\ne\nPe\nrs\nica\nria\n \nm\nac\nul\nos\na-\ntyp\ne\nRu\nm\nex\n \nac\net\nos\nel\nla\nRu\nm\nex\n \nob\ntu\nsif\nol\niu\ns-\ntyp\ne\nRu\nm\nex\n \nsa\nng\nui\nne\nus\n-\ntyp\ne\nBr\nas\nsic\nac\nea\ne\nCa\nllu\nna\n \nvu\nlga\nris\nFi\nlip\nen\ndu\nla\nLy\nth\nru\nm\n \nsa\nlic\nar\nia\n-\ntyp\ne\nHy\ndr\noc\not\nyle\n \nvu\nlga\nris\nAp\nia\nce\nae\n \nun\ndif\nf.\nMe\nnh\na-\ntyp\ne\nPl\nan\nta\ngo\n \nm\nar\niti\nm\na\nPl\nan\nta\ngo\n \nco\nro\nno\npu\ns\nPl\nan\nta\ngo\n \nm\najo\nr\nPl\nan\nta\ngo\n \nlan\nce\nol\nat\na\nRu\nbia\nce\nae\nSu\ncc\nisa\n \npr\nat\nen\nsis\nCi\nrs\niu\nm\n-\ntyp\ne\nLa\nct\nuc\nea\ne\nAc\nhi\nlle\na-\ntyp\ne\nCy\npe\nra\nce\nae\n \nun\ndif\nf.\nPo\nac\nea\ne\nPo\nac\nea\ne \nan\nnu\nlu\ns \ndia\nm\net\ner\n \n>\n8\u03bc\nm\nSe\nca\nle\n \nce\nre\nal\ne\nNy\nm\nph\nae\na \nal\nba\nNu\nph\nar\nPo\nta\nm\nog\net\non\n \nna\nta\nns\n-\ntyp\ne\nSp\nar\nga\nni\num\n \nem\ner\nsu\nm\n-\ntyp\ne\nTy\nph\na \nla\ntif\nol\nia\nOs\nm\nun\nda\n \nre\nga\nlis\nPo\nlyp\nod\niu\nm\nPt\ner\nidi\num\n \naq\nui\nlin\num\nAt\nhy\nriu\nm\n \nfilx\n-\nfe\nrm\nin\na\nPt\ner\nop\nsid\na \n(m\non\nol\net\ne) \nin\nde\nt.\nSp\nha\ngn\num\nPr\ne-\nQu\nat\ner\nna\nry\n \nsp\nor\nes\nIn\nde\nte\nrm\nin\nat\ne\nFo\nra\nm\n \nte\nst\n \nlin\nin\ngs\nUn\nkn\now\nn\nTr\nee\ns\nSh\nru\nbs\n \nan\nd \ncli\nm\nbe\nrs\nDw\nar\nf s\nhr\nub\ns a\nnd\n \nhe\nrb\ns\n%\n lo\nss\n \non\n \nign\niti\non\nTrees Shrubs Dwarf shrubs and herbs Aq.

The radiocarbon date is a pooled mean of two dates \n(see text for details and Table 1). \n \nMean particle size data (Figure 6a) record a clear, high frequency cyclicity, especially \nin textual zone 2.  But the sand-silt-clay plot shows how, even in this coarser zone, \nregular phases of mud dominated sedimentation occurred (Figure 6b).  Selected \nparticle size frequency distributions identify the typically bi- or tri-modal character of \nthe sediments.  These are indicative of the amalgamation of several mm scale sand-\nmud couplets in each sample.

Foraminiferal diagram from West Winchelsea. \n \nDespite the somewhat noisy appearance of the raw data, plotting on a log scale and \nselecting discrete sections for analysis show that two relatively well developed high \nfrequency cycles are preserved in the sequence (Figure 7a).  Thicker sand layers seem \nto repeat every few layers, but more prominently every 7-10 layers or so.  A three \npoint moving average highlights the slightly longer wavelength periodicities and \nprovides a good indication of the changing character of the signal through the core \n(Figure 7b).  At depth the longer 7-10 layer cycles dominate with the 3-5 layer period \nappearing to be very much subordinate e.g. layers 140-160.  However, in the upper \nhalf of the sequence a more consistent, higher resolution record is preserved.  Thus, \nfrom around layer 240 the 3-5 layer cycle is more pronounced and is nested within the \ndistinct alternation of relatively higher and lower peaks that corresponds to the longer \n7-10 layer periods (Figures 7a, b).  The unusually thick layers around 271 and 281 are  \n 24\ndisturbed and almost certainly were originally deposited as several thin laminae.  The \nclarity of the signal degrades towards the top of the sequence.  \n \nThe spectral density plot (Figure 7c) identifies three broadly defined high frequency \ncycles with wavelengths of 3-5, 7-9 and 10-12 layers\/cycle respectively.  Two longer \nperiod harmonics (not shown) are also recorded as broad (\u00b1 8-10 layers) peaks \ncentred on 26 and 50 layers\/cycle.  Some sense of these long wavelength cycles is \nevident in Figure 7b, but is most clearly demonstrated by smoothing out the higher \norder cycles with a seven point moving average (Figure 7d).   \n \n6.6 Radiocarbon chronology \n \nFour radiocarbon dates were collected from the upper peat contact and the \nimmediately overlying sediment in core 3.  The lower pair of dates from the main \nsample core are on the humin and humic fractions from a bulk sample of well-\nhumified peat (GrN-28734, 1360 \u00b1 60 BP and GrN-28735, 1300 \u00b1 60 BP \nrespectively, pooled mean age 1348 \u00b1 27 BP (1307-1186 cal. yr BP)).  Replicate \nsamples on fine root material in Unit 2, extracted by sieving bulk samples between -\n1.82 and -1.92 m OD from a duplicate sample core (core depths 492 to 482 cm), \nyielded similar ages (GrA-25302, 1170 \u00b1 35 BP and OxA-13460, 1297 \u00b1 100 BP, \npooled mean age 1248 \u00b1 22 BP (1263-1085 cal. yr BP)).    \n \n 25\nTable 3.

Interpretation \n \n7.1 Changing palaeoenvironments at West Winchelsea \n \nPollen preserved in the top of the peat at West Winchelsea indicate that a fen carr \nenvironment with alder (LPAZ WW-1, Figure 4) was initially replaced by a \ntransitional fresh \/ brackish water sedge dominated community (LPAZ WW-2).  The \n 32\nhigh Chenopodiaceae and Spergula-type frequencies above 495 cm (LPAZ WW-3) \nrecord the development of salt marsh.  The occurrence of low frequencies of \nforaminifera that occur today on salt marshes indicates that such conditions prevailed \nimmediately above the peat (LFAZ 1).  Sedimentation across the end of peat \naccumulation and into the overlying salt marsh sediments appears continuous.  Above \n470 cm a more mixed foraminiferal assemblage occurs that contains salt marsh and \nbrackish lagoon taxa (Figure 5, Table 3).  Rootlets preserved throughout this sediment \n(Unit 2) indicate that water depths were sufficiently shallow for the continued in situ \ngrowth of halophytes and for this reason we interpret this sediment as of lower salt \nmarsh origin.  The radiocarbon dates show that the initial inundation of the peat \nsurface by tidal waters occurred after c. 1307-1186 cal. yr BP.  The pooled 14C data \nfrom the roots in Unit 2 of 1263-1085 cal. yr BP confirm continuous sedimentation \nduring this interval. \n \nAn important change in environment is recorded above 367 cm by foraminiferal and \ngrain size data.  Most obvious is a decline over 10 to 20 cm of the salt marsh \/ \nbrackish lagoon taxa and an increase in those from nearshore shelf environments, \nespecially Gavelinopsis praegeri, Quinquecolina sp. and Brizalina variabilis.  A \nrange of other minor taxa indicative of nearshore shelf also increases.  This change in \nassemblage records a shift to more strongly marine conditions. The grain size data \n(Figure 6a, b, Table 4) record this change in environment by a coarsening of the \nsediment and a change from a fine silt to a well-laminated sandy mud \/ muddy sand.  \nThese changes in stratigraphy may record some erosion at the boundary between Unit \n2 and 3.  Laminae counts through Unit 3 provide information regarding the process \nresponsible for deposition of these sediments, water depth, as well as duration of \nsedimentation.   \n 33\n The repetitive thickening and thinning of the sand layers in this unit, forming a long \nsequence of nested sinusoids of increasing wavelength, is strongly indicative of a tidal \ncontrol on deposition (Kvale and Archer, 1991; Kvale et al., 1994, 1999).  We \ninterpret the higher frequency cycles of layer thickness as representing deposition \nover the neap-spring and lunar month respectively.  The fact that the wavelengths of \nthese cycles are not precisely defined on the spectral density plot (Figure 7c) can be \nattributed to the natural variation within the system.  The apparent dominance of the \nlunar monthly cycles, particularly in the smoothed data (Figure 7b), agrees with \nprevious modelling of truncated rhythmite sequences whereby the fortnightly \ninequality becomes more pronounced as the number of layers preserved declines \n(Archer and Johnson, 1997).  As position in the tidal frame is a key control on the \nnumber of layers preserved, this site must have been in a relatively elevated (i.e. \nshallow) position. \n \nThe number of layers recorded in each cycle does not match the theoretical number of \ntides in any given period.  This implies that conditions suitable for the preservation of \ndistinct sand and mud laminae were restricted to just a few tides, focussed on the \nhighest spring tides, during any neap-spring cycle.  Particularly energetic tides may \nlead to the amalgamation of successive sand layers due to erosion of the intervening \nmuddy layer.  At other times in the tidal cycle, such as the low solsticial tides, \ndeposition either did not take place at all or was restricted to the accumulation of mud, \nthe net result being the low number of layers preserved.  This pattern is reflected in \nthe textural data (Figure 6b). \n \n 34\nThe most favoured conditions for rhythmite deposition - thicker layers and a higher \nresolution signal - probably coincided with the biannual equinoctial peak in tidal \nenergy.  The seven point smoothing of the layer thickness data highlights these \nequinoctial peaks in sand layer thickness (Figure 7d) with wavelengths of between 10 \nand 46 layers in each equinoctial bundle.  We can use this pattern to estimate \naccumulation rates.  Figure 7d contains approximately 18-19 equinoctial peaks, \naround nine years, which equates to a deposition rate for this 1.75 m long sequence of \n0.2 m\/y.  This is perhaps higher than would previously have been anticipated from a \nsheltered back-barrier environment but is in accordance with other tidal rhythmite \nsequences both on Romney Marsh (Stupples, 2002) and elsewhere (e.g. Dalrymple et \nal., 1991; Archer, 1991; Kvale and Archer, 1991; Martino and Sanderson, 1993;  \nTessier et al., 1995). \n \nTable 4.  Grain size zones from West Winchelsea core  \nZone (core depth cm) Characteristics \nZone 3 (175-0 cm) A sandy mud or mud, with a mean grain size comprising \nfine to medium silt. Typically sand (10%), silt (70%) and \nclay (20%).  Very poorly sorted.

Mean grain size 10-60\u00b5. \nZone 1 (519-369 cm) A mud, with a mean grain size comprising fine to medium \nsilt.  Typically sand (10%), silt (70%) and clay (20%). \n 35\nPoorly sorted.  Several of the lowermost samples are very \nclay-rich.  Mean grain size 5-15\u00b5. \n \n \nAlternative, non-tidal, driving mechanisms for laminated sequences must also be \nconsidered.  These include the potential for misinterpretation of statistical data (e.g. \nTessier, 1998) and the possibility of a tidal signature being disturbed by a secondary \nphysical or biological process (e.g. Dalrymple et al., 1991).  Here, the clearly nested \ncharacter of the high frequency signal, textural evidence which supports both the high \nfrequency variability and the longer period cyclicity, and the consistency of the signal \nthrough nearly 2 m of sediment, provide confidence in our interpretation of rapid \ndeposition in a tide dominated setting.  Physical and\/or biological reworking is \nevident along the sequence, but in the section analysed here, is not intense enough to \ndestroy the sedimentary structure.  The possible importance of storm action on \nRomney Marsh has been mentioned elsewhere (Allen, 2004) and its impact on this \nsequence cannot be discounted (e.g. layers 271 and 281), but it has not been sufficient \nto disrupt the regularly sinusoidal tidal signal.  Similarly, seasonal fluxes in sediment \nsupply, if present, could only obscure the tidal signal if the availability of sediment \nwas, at times, restricted such that distinct laminations could not form (e.g. Dark and \nAllen, 2005).  Alternatively, such seasonal variations may simply enhance the effect \nof the winter equinox on rhythmite preservation. \n \nThe change from Unit 3 to 4 records a decline in energy conditions as water depths \nshallowed and salinity decreased.  We suggest that these changes record land \nreclamation in the lower Brede that is documented in historical records from 1302 \nAD.  Although the valley was subjected to repeated flooding during the 14th century, \n 36\nit was largely reclaimed from the sea by 1460 AD (Gardiner, 1995).  The foraminifera \nsuggest that open marine conditions persisted during the initial phase of lower energy \nconditions.  Above 75 cm there is an increase in the frequencies of the brackish \nlagoon species, Haynesina germanica and Elphidium williamsoni (Figure 5), although \nlow counts above 40 cm make palaeoenvironmental interpretations difficult. \n \n7.2 Peat compaction and the provision of accommodation space at West \nWinchelsea \n \nThe West Winchelsea core preserves evidence for a rapid increase in water depth and \nthe accumulation of 4.8 m of minerogenic sediments in at most a few hundred years.  \nWe can discount a rapid rise in relative sea level as the cause for this change, given \nwhat we know about regional and global trends in ocean volume and crustal motions \nduring the late Holocene (Waller and Long, 2002).  Erosion of the salt marsh \nsediments (Unit 2) from the sample site may have provided some accommodation \nspace \u2013 we note, for example, that this unit is thin in core 7 (Fig. 3) and that the \nchange in grain-size data between Unit 2 and 3 is quite abrupt.  However, we also \nobserve that the foraminiferal data show a continuous and not abrupt change in \npalaeoenvironment between Unit 2 and 3.  Moreover, even if limited erosion had \noccurred at the boundary between Unit 2 and 3, this would not alter the main \nconclusion of this study that significant compaction of the peat bed at West \nWinchelsea occurred in a geologically short period of time and caused significant \nlandscape change. \n \nAnalogues from the geological record, and from the coastal plain of northwest \nEurope, provide a working hypothesis to explain the West Winchelsea sequence.  In a \n 37\nstudy of the tidal mudflat deposits that overlie the Pennsylvanian coal measures in the \neastern part of the Illionois Basin, USA, Kvale and Mastalerz (1998) suggest that the \ntransgression of the Lower Block Coal peat was initiated by the rapid collapse of the \npeat surface.  They propose that these ancient wetlands were destroyed following \ninitial saline flooding that killed the marsh plants.  Subsequent penetration of tidal \ncreeks into the former marshland and an associated increase in tidal prism was \naccompanied by autocompaction of the peat, the sudden creation of accommodation \nspace and the rapid deposition of thick sequences of tidal rhythmites above the peat \nsurface.  Rapidly accumulating sediments buried upright stumps of pteridosperms, \ncalamites and occasional Lepidodendron wortheni greater than 4 m tall.  \n \nElements of this model have also been independently invoked to explain the late \nHolocene inundation of peat on the Belgium coastal plain.  Thus, Baeteman et al. \n(2002) suggest that after c. 3400 cal. yr BP a peat bed began to be locally eroded by \nchannels.  Tidal water only partly flooded the peat at first, and a veneer of sediment \naccumulated on the peat surface.  These channels lowered the surface by drainage and \npromoted peat collapse.  Initially, the majority of sedimentation occurred in the main \ntidal channels but, once these channels were full of sediment, a more extensive phase \nof lateral sediment accretion occurred across the peat surface.   This second phase saw \nwidespread erosion of the peat surface and the recently deposited overlying salt marsh \nand mudflat sediments.  Baeteman et al. (2002) and Baeteman (in press) suggest that \ncompaction of the peat provided the increase in accommodation space required to \ndrive channel activity during this phase. \n \nOur West Winchelsea record suggests elements of each of these models.  The litho-, \nbio- and chronostratigraphic data indicate that the initial inundation of the peat at the \n 38\nsite of the sample core was gradual and accompanied by the development of salt \nmarsh conditions.  In contrast to the Baeteman et al. (2002) record, there appears to \nhave been a reasonable supply of fine-grained sediment to form the salt marsh \nsediment that accumulated directly on the peat surface in the first few centuries \nfollowing tidal inundation.   \n \nThe increase in water depth over the sample site above 369 cm reflects enhanced \nprovision of accommodation space and the lateral expansion of tidal channel \nconditions across the West Winchelsea study site.  We hypothesise that this change \ncorresponds to the well-documented breach of the Rye barrier in the 13th century.  The \nassociated increase in tidal range, caused as the back-barrier tidal prism enlarged \nfurther, de-watered the peat via creek drainage (c.f. Baeteman et al., 2002).  Once \ninitiated, a strong positive feedback cycle developed in which dewatering promoted \ncompaction and lowering of the peat surface which, in turn, caused an increase in \nflooding frequency and accelerated loading and compaction by sediment and tidal \nwater.   The increase in accommodation space provided the ideal conditions for the \naccumulation of the tidal rhythmites observed in the West Winchelsea sample core.  \nAs the accumulation of sediment progressed, so the sediment fined upwards and \npreservation of higher resolution tidal cycles increased.  Finally, a progressive \ndecrease in flooding frequency was accompanied by a reduction in accommodation \nspace and tidal energy as a prelude to reclamation.     \n \nThere is independent dating evidence to support this model.  At a site on the edge of \nPett Level (Figure 1) the peat is overlain by a slope-wash deposit c. 50 cm thick, \nwhich in turn is buried by 3 m of partially laminated sands and silts.  Deposition of \nthe slope-wash deposit appears to have ceased towards the end of the Roman period, \n 39\nand radiocarbon dates on the humin and humic fraction from the top of this deposit \ndate yield a pooled mean age of 1895 \u00b1 51 (1947-1710 cal. yr BP) (Waller et al., in \npress).  However, at some locations the slope wash deposit is highly heterogeneous \nand contains peaty pockets. Two pottery sherds were recovered in situ from this \nsediment in adjacent boreholes and date from the 12th to mid 13th century and mid 13th \nto 14th century (Barber, pers. comm.).  The evidence for the disturbance of the peat, \ncombined with the age discordance between the pottery and radiocarbon dates, \nstrongly suggests that the peat surface was \u201cworked\u201d, either for fuel or salt (c.f. Behre \net al., 1979).  With the slope-wash \/ peat deposits relatively accessible during the \nearly medieval period, the overlying sands and silts must have accumulated rapidly, \nprobably following the breach in the Rye barrier during the 13th century.   \n \n8. Discussion \n \nThe model outlined above envisages large scale, rapid, changes in palaeoenvironment \nin the lower Brede Valley that were driven by compaction of the main marsh peat.  \nWe now compare the West Winchelsea findings with other data from the surface of \nthe main marsh peat from across the Rye area, and the Romney Marsh depositional \ncomplex more widely, to establish the magnitude of this compaction, and whether the \ntrends observed here are reflected elsewhere.  \n \n8.1 The main marsh peat in the Rye area \n \nAs well as the detailed new investigations from 10 locations (Figure 1), \nlithostratigraphic information from the Rye area is available from previous \npalaeoenvironmental work (Long et al., 1996; Waller et al., 1988; Waller and Kirby, \n 40\n2002) and commercial schemes.  The resulting dataset provides us with over 300 \nborehole logs.  Deep boreholes sunk in the Wainway channel and along the edge of \nthe gravel deposits at Rye Harbour suggest peat is absent from the south-eastern part \nof the study area (Figure 8).  In addition, peat is also absent from the post 13th century \nAD routes of the rivers Brede, Tillingham and Rother. As with the channel adjacent to \nWest Winchelsea described above, post-depositional erosion of the peat seems \nprobable at these sites. \n 41\nLong et al.

Frequency histogram of the height of the upper contact (in meters OD) to the main marsh peat in the Rye area. \nAccompanying map shows areas of marshland from which the data have been extracted. \n \n 42\nPeat is recorded in 259 boreholes. A frequency distribution of the altitude of the upper \nsurface of the peat (Figure 8) shows a bimodal pattern with peaks at -1 m OD and 2 m \nOD.  The highest altitudes (above 2 m OD) are recorded from upper valley locations; \nthe Pannel valley where unusually peat outcrops at the modern surface (Waller, 1993) \nand at Lea Farm which similarly lies beyond the inland limits of marine \/ brackish \nsedimentation.  Altitudes above 1 m OD are also recorded from sites that lie within \n100 m of the edge of the valleys \/ Levels (such as Houghton Green and Pannel Farm).  \nAt such locations the peat bed directly overlies incompressible bedrock strata.  In \nmost boreholes, the peat is over and underlain by marine \/ brackish sediments and the \naltitude of the upper peat surface occurs between 0 and -2.5 m OD.  The lowest \ncontacts (below -2.5 m OD) are from sites where the peat is thin and (where data is \navailable) the upper peat contact sharp, indicating that most of the peat has been \neroded away, though the redeposition of eroded peat with tidal channels is also a \npossibility (Long et al., 1996). \n \nErosion and compaction can be separated at sites where detailed litho- and \nbiostratigraphic data are available.  Altitudes for sites where the upper contact of the \npeat appears gradational and there is no biostratigraphic evidence for erosion range \nfrom 2.21 m OD at Houghton Green to -1.99 m OD at West Winchelsea.  If these \ncontacts represent a former land surface which had a relatively even altitude (and at \nneither site is there evidence for raised bog formation) then West Winchelsea has \nbeen lowered by a minimum (as it is highly unlikely that the Houghton Green site \nexperienced no compaction) of 4.2 m.  With the current peat thickness at West \nWinchelsea of between 2 and 3 m (Waller et al., 1988; Long et al., 1996), this level of \ncompaction equates to a reduction in peat thickness of approximately 50%.   \n \n 43\n8.2 The age of the main marsh peat surface in the Rye area \n \nA chronology for peat formation in the Rye area is important if we are to establish \nthat the un-eroded upper surface of the peat is a former land surface and so separate \nthe effects of sediment compaction from those arising from other processes, such as \nrelative sea-level rise.  Radiocarbon dates obtained from the upper surface of the peat \nin the Rye area (Table  1) range from 3485 \u00b1 28 BP at Pewis Marsh to 1240 \u00b1 50 BP \nat East Guldeford.  The simplest explanation for these age differences is that a \nprogressive inundation of the main marsh peat resulted in the inundation of low-lying \nsites ahead of topographically higher sites.  However, an age-depth plot of peat \nsurface dates suggests that this is not the case (Figure 9), with same-aged index points \ndiffering in elevation by at least 3 m.  For this reason, we do not believe that this age \nrange reflects real diachroneity in wetland inundation.  Moreover, pollen and multiple \nradiocarbon dates from several sites in the area suggest that the peat slowed or \nstopped accumulating during this interval.  At some sites (e.g. Pewis Marsh), the \nslope-wash sediments occur above the peat, whilst elsewhere (e.g. Pett Level) the peat \ntop appears to have been disturbed by peat cutting (see above).  Only at West \nWinchlesea and East Guldeford do we find clear evidence for continuous \nsedimentation across the end of peat formation and into the establishment of salt \nmarsh conditions.  The radiocarbon dates from these sites (Table 1) suggest initial \ninundation of the peat sometime after c. AD 700-800, that is some 600 to 500 years \nbefore the 13th century storms that supposedly caused the initial breach of the Rye \ncoastal barrier.  \n 44\n 8.3 Implications of peat compaction for sea-level studies \n \nMuch effort in sea-level studies has focussed on reducing the height errors associated \nwith reconstructing past RSL change.  This has included the meticulous \nreconstruction of errors associated with, amongst others, the angle of borehole, \nlevelling and benchmark uncertainties, as well as the indicative meaning and range of \nsea-level index points.  Taken together, the root mean square error of these variables \nadds up to c. \u00b10.25 m to 0.50 m (e.g. Shennan, 1982; Long et al., 2000).  However, \nmost age\/altitude plots of RSL data demonstrate a between-point scatter that, at any \ngiven point in time, far exceeds these carefully reconstructed levels of uncertainty.  \nThis is well-illustrated by the data from Romney Marsh described above (Figure 9), or \nin the 3 to 6 m-wide envelope that captures the scatter observed in the mid and late \nHolocene index points from the Fenland (e.g. Shennan, 1994).  This range highlights \nthe importance of peat compaction as a potential source of height uncertainty in late \nHolocene RSL reconstructions.     \n \nAllen (1999) suggests that the effects of sediment compaction are likely to be greater \nfor transgressive contacts, especially where they overlie thick peat beds, compared to \nregressive contacts that lie above clastic sediment sequences.  This pattern is certainly \nevident from the study area when we combine the Rye data with other previously \npublished mid and early Holocene sea-level data from Romney Marsh (Figure 10).  \nThis analysis shows that the age\/height scatter in the index points derived from the \nregressive contact to the main peat bed is much smaller compared with that from the \ntransgressive contact to this peat bed.  This comparison confirms the importance of \navoiding the use of transgressive contacts for time\/altitude sea-level reconstruction, \n 45\nespecially where they occur from the upper part of thick peat beds.  Although the \nexclusive use of basal peat as a means to minimise compaction is widespread in some \nareas of northwest Europe (e.g. Denys and Baeteman, 1995) and on the Atlantic \nseaboard of the U.S.A. (e.g. Gehrels et al., 1996), dates from the transgressive contact \nto intercalated peats remain an important component of U.K. sea-level research. \n 46\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 40003500\nAge (cal. yr BP)\n-3\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\nMe\nte\nrs\n O\nD\nScotney\nPannel\nFarm\nLittle Cheyne Court\nGuldeford\nAllen's\nBank Midley\nWest\nWinchelsea\nRye 27\nOld Place\nPewis Marsh\nPett Level\nHope Fm\nBrookland\nCadborough\nGreyfriars\nScotney\nDowels\nChapel\nBank\nTishy's Sewer\nTishy's Sewer\nHorsemarsh\nScotney\nScotney\nRomney 7\nMidley\nRoadend\nRye 33a\nRomney 18\n0\u00b040'E 0\u00b045' 0\u00b050' 0\u00b055' 1\u00b000'\n51\u00b005'\n51\u00b000'\n50\u00b055'\nkilometres0 5\nR.

Note that \nthe scatter in the regressive contact dates, which lie directly above relatively incompressible silts, is much less than that for dates \nfrom the transgressive contacts which come from the surface of a thick bed of peat. \n \nThe Rye data show there is no doubt as to the significance of peat compaction as a \ndriving mechanism behind coastal change and, in particular, as a process that \ncontributed towards the late Holocene inundation of coastal wetlands.  Indeed, \nalthough the exact timing of this event varies between places (Long et al., 2000), it \nseems likely that many of these former wetlands effectively \u201cself-destructed\u201d as a \n 48\nresult of the compaction-related processes of dewatering and desiccation and loading \nby tidal water and clastic sediment.   \n \nWhen considered over Holocene timescales, the effects of peat compaction on \nlandscape change are likely to have increased towards the present.  This is because \nmuch of the early\/mid Holocene stratigraphic record comprises minerogenic \nsediments, with only relatively thin and short-lived episodes of peat formation (e.g. \nDevoy, 1979; Long et al., 2000).  Changes in RSL during this interval were strongly \ninfluenced by a combination of crustal motions and variations in ocean volume.  \nDuring the mid Holocene, however, the shift to the extensive accumulation of peat \nbeds, which today are still typically 1-3 m in thickness, meant that the coast was \nprimed for major changes independent of any shifts in long-term crustal motions or \neustatic sea-level change.  It is ironic, therefore, that during the late Holocene, a time \nwhen the rate of sea-level rise was falling, the process of non-linear peat compaction \nmeant that the potential for catastrophic coastal change was actually increasing.   \n \n9. Conclusions \n \nIn this paper we have explored the role of peat compaction in controlling landscape \nand sea-level change in the late Holocene on Romney Marsh, focussing attention on \nan extensive dataset from the area surrounding the town of Rye.  Our main \nconclusions are as follows: \n \n1.  The surface of a laterally persistent late Holocene peat bed in the Rye area lies \nbetween c. -2.5 m OD and +3 m OD.  This surface is lowest where the peat is thickest \n 49\nand underlain by compressible minerogenic sediments. It is highest at the valley \/ \nLevels edges and beyond the inland limits of marine \/ brackish sedimentation.   \n \n2.  Much of this variability is due to the effects of differential sediment (including \npeat) compaction. Same aged sea-level index points from the surface of this peat bed \nvary in height by up to 3 m.   \n \n3.  A detailed analysis of pollen, foraminiferal and grain size data from West \nWinchelsea, provides new information on the magnitude and timing of peat \ncompaction.  Following an initial gradual inundation of this site, there was a \nsignificant increase in water depth and tidal energy that was accompanied by rapid \ndeposition of tidally laminated sediments.  We hypothesise that this increase in water \ndepth was the result of historically documented events; the development of a large \nbreach in the barrier and consequent flooding of the 13th century.  Headward erosion \nof creeks, dewatering of the peat, and direct loading of the peat surface by sediment \nand water, combined in a positive feedback cycle to create new accommodation space \nand encourage rapid inter- and subtidal sedimentation.   \n \n4.  Our work demonstrates the powerful influence that peat compaction had on the \nevolution of the late Holocene landscape at Rye and, we believe, at many other \ncoastal lowlands in northwest Europe.  Although the exact timing of peat burial varies \nbetween sites, this process is likely to have been a key driving mechanism behind \nrapid coastal change, far exceeding the effects of either eustatic change or crustal \nuplift\/subsidence.   \n \nAcknowledgements \n 50\n This work was funded by English Heritage as part of the Aggregate Levy \nSustainability Fund.
