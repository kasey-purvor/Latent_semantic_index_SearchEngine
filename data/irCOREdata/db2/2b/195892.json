During the last years,\nseveral ways to classify wheezing children into different disease phenotypes have been proposed and are increasingly used\nfor clinical guidance, but validation of these hypothetical entities is difficult.\nMethodology\/Principal Findings: The aim of this study was to develop a testable disease model which reflects the full\nspectrum of wheezing illness in preschool children. We performed a qualitative study among a panel of 7 experienced\nclinicians from 4 European countries working in primary, secondary and tertiary paediatric care. In a series of questionnaire\nsurveys and structured discussions, we found a general consensus that preschool wheezing disorders consist of several\nphenotypes, with a great heterogeneity of specific disease concepts between clinicians. Initially, 24 disease entities were\ndescribed among the 7 physicians. In structured discussions, these could be narrowed down to three entities which were\nlinked to proposed mechanisms: a) allergic wheeze, b) non-allergic wheeze due to structural airway narrowing and c) non-\nallergic wheeze due to increased immune response to viral infections. This disease model will serve to create an artificial\ndataset that allows the validation of data-driven multidimensional methods, such as cluster analysis, which have been\nproposed for identification of wheezing phenotypes in children.\nConclusions\/Significance: While there appears to be wide agreement among clinicians that wheezing disorders consist of\nseveral diseases, there is less agreement regarding their number and nature. A great diversity of disease concepts exist but a\nunified phenotype classification reflecting underlying disease mechanisms is lacking. We propose a disease model which\nmay help guide future research so that proposed mechanisms are measured at the right time and their role in disease\nheterogeneity can be studied.\nCitation: Spycher BD, Silverman M, Barben J, Eber E, Guinand S, et al.

Within this syndrome, various phenotypes have been\nproposed, classified either by triggers of wheeze, into \u2018\u2018episodic\nviral wheeze\u2019\u2019 triggered only by colds and \u2018\u2018multiple-trigger\nwheeze\u2019\u2019 triggered also by other factors [1,2,3], or by time course\ninto \u2018\u2018early transient\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018persistent\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018late-onset\u2019\u2019 wheeze [4,5].\nSuch phenotypes are being used in the study of risk factors\n[4,6,7,8,9], prognosis [10,11,12,13] and response to treatment\n[2,14,15], and also increasingly in treatment recommendations\nand guidelines [2,16,17]. However it is unclear whether they\nrepresent distinct disease entities with separate aetiologies or rather\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8533\ndifferent facets of the same disease. Because the underlying disease\nmechanisms are poorly understood it is difficult to define a\nbiologically plausible classification of wheezing disorders.\nRecently a \u2018\u2018hypothesis-free\u2019\u2019 approach to define phenotypes has\nbeen explored [18,19,20,21,22]. This approach uses multivariate\nmethods such as cluster analysis applied to a wide range of\nobserved features including symptoms, signs or physiological\nmeasurements, in order to identify disease groups that might better\nreflect underlying biological pathways. These methods have\nyielded clusters (i.e. phenotypes) that are compatible with previous\nproposed phenotypes [19,20]. However, clustering methods may\ndistinguish groups regardless of whether they exist in the\npopulation as true entities or not. It is therefore essential to\nvalidate the output of these methods, i.e. to test whether the\nmethods can distinguish between a homogenous and heteroge-\nneous population, and whether they can identify the true disease\nentities existing within a heterogeneous population. Such a\nvalidation can, for instance, be done by artificially creating a\nheterogeneous population consisting of known disease entities and\nthen applying the clustering method to data from this population\nto see whether the method can detect the heterogeneity and\nrecover the true entities. This however requires a plausible model\nof disease consisting of predefined disease entities.\nThis study describes the creation of a plausible model of\nwheezing diseases in children, consisting of distinct hypothetical\ndisease entities which would help in the validation of \u2018\u2018hypothesis-\nfree\u2019\u2019 methods. In order to obtain a disease model, we set up a\nsmall panel of clinicians familiar with paediatric wheezing\ndisorders to agree on a set of disease entities for wheezing in\npreschool children based on their clinical experience.\nWe report here the qualitative part of this study which aimed to\ncollect the initial views of the clinicians in the panel regarding the\nclassification of wheezing disorders and, subsequently, to create a\ndisease model by consent through structured discussions.\nMethods\nSelection of the Panel\nThe core group (authors BS, MS and CK) invited 9 clinicians\nfrom 4 countries Switzerland (CH), Austria (AT), the Netherlands\n(NL) and the UK of whom 7 participated (CH 2 participants, AT\n1, NL 2, UK 2). These were selected from contacts known to\nmembers of the core group or brought to their attention through\ncolleagues. All were clinicians working in primary care or\npaediatric pulmonology, who have seen many preschool children\nwith wheeze, and whose individual views on asthma phenotypes\nwere not previously known to the core group. The panel size was\nkept small enough to allow structured telephone discussions\nbetween members.\nCollecting Initial Views\nThe panel members were sent a questionnaire containing three\nquestions. First, panel members were asked which view they most\nagreed with: (a) wheezing disorders in preschool children form a\nsingle, though highly variable, disease entity, (b) wheezing\ndisorders in preschool children consist of different disease entities,\nor (c) undecided. In this context, a disease entity was defined as a\nwheezing disorder affecting a group of children which was distinct\nin aetiology from other wheezing disorders in other groups. The\npopulation of interest was defined as 0\u20135 year olds from the\ngeneral population who are brought to a general practitioner with\nwheeze as a major symptom, and in whom wheeze caused by\nspecific conditions such as cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary\nmalformations or foreign body aspiration had been excluded.\nSecond, respondents consenting to view (b) (above) were asked\nhow many disease entities they thought existed, and third, for each\nof these entities, they were asked to provide a descriptive label and\na bullet-point description of symptom patterns, physiological\nfeatures, possible mechanisms, natural history and response to\ntreatments.\nThe core group extracted the descriptive information on the\nproposed disease entities into tabular format. For this, feature\ncategories (such as \u2018\u2018shortness of breath\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018activities limited\u2019\u2019)\nwere formed based on the descriptions of all proposed entities. For\neach of the disease entities the table contained a feature profile\nwith the entry \u20181\u2019 if a particular feature was mentioned and \u20180\u2019 if\nnot. Using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) [23], these\nfeature profiles were graphically displayed in a plane representing\nthe two main dimensions of variability. In this representation,\npoints lying close together represent entities with similar feature\nprofiles.\nAgreement on a Disease Model\nThe core group defined an initial model consisting of disease\nentities that had been proposed in a similar form by at least two\nrespondents. The entities were described using a synthesis of the\noriginal bullet point descriptions by panel members. The panel\nwas asked to propose and discuss changes to this model and agree\non a final set of disease entities that could be justified by distinct\npathophysiological mechanisms. These discussions were conduct-\ned by conference calls followed by e-mail correspondence. The\nphone conferences were recorded, abstracted and summarised to\ninform all panel members and for later reference.\nResults\nInitial Views and Propositions\nAmong the 7 respondents to the initial invitation, 6 held the\nview that these disorders consist of different disease entities, while\none was undecided. Each of the 6 independently proposed and\ndescribed 2\u20135 disease entities for classifying childhood wheezing\ndisorders, amounting to an initial total of 24 disease entities\n(Table 1, Figure 1). MCA of the feature profiles showed that when\ndifferent panel members suggested similar labels they also gave a\nsimilar description of the corresponding entities (Figure 1). For\ninstance, among the 6 panel members subscribing to the multiple-\ndisease view, all proposed an entity corresponding to wheeze\nassociated with allergy or multiple triggers. These entities lie\nclustered together on the positive side of the main axis, axis 1,\nidentified by MCA (Figure 1, ellipse on the right). Similarly, these\nmembers each suggested an entity corresponding to virus-induced\n(exclusive viral) wheeze with no other triggers (Figure 1, ellipse on\nthe bottom left). Furthermore, two members suggested entities\ninvolving structural narrowing of airways because of maternal\nsmoking during pregnancy, and two members suggested an entity\ncomprising children born preterm. As a basis for further\ndiscussion, the core team therefore suggested an initial disease\nmodel consisting of these four entities using the labels: (i) allergic\/\nmultiple-trigger wheeze, (ii) exclusive viral wheeze, (iii) airway\nnarrowing as a consequence of a developmental process, and (iv)\nex-preterms.\nDiscussions and Agreement on a Disease Model\nThere was general agreement among members that an\nallergic form of wheeze associated with interval symptoms\nshould be distinguished from wheeze occurring only during viral\ninfections, i.e. (i) and (ii). The panel members also agreed that\nthe entities (iii) and (iv) might be subsumed to a single entity,\nA Model for Childhood Wheezing\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8533\nbecause structural airway narrowing was considered to be the\nmajor cause for viral wheeze in this age group. Both smoking\nduring pregnancy and pre-maturity could be regarded as\npredisposing factors for airway narrowing and should not define\nseparate disease entities.\nThere was a consensus that atopy and structural airway\nnarrowing represented two mechanisms of current wheezing.\nProposing further mechanisms and phenotypic features that would\ndistinguish these from other mechanisms was perceived as highly\nspeculative for the following reasons.\n1. Although triggers are commonly used to distinguish pheno-\ntypes, they may not be specific for individual mechanisms. For\ninstance, wheeze occurring only during viral infections may be\ndue to structurally narrow airways. However, almost all wheezy\nchildren in this age group have symptoms during viral\ninfections, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved.\n2. There is a lack of feasible measurements in this age group that\nwould distinguish children with different outcomes in later\nchildhood. For instance, in the first few years of life, children\nwho later develop allergic wheeze are clinically very similar to\nchildren who only wheeze during viral infections. One can only\nspeculate whether the mechanisms for viral wheeze in these\ntwo groups differ.\n3. It is unclear to what extent this age group is also affected by\nnon-allergic, multiple-trigger wheeze that might be indicative\nof different mechanisms.\nHowever, for the purpose of this study, the panel members\nagreed on a final set of 3 entities (Table 2) that plausibly explain\nthe observed heterogeneity of childhood wheezing disorders:\nAllergic wheeze, non-allergic wheeze due to structural airway\nnarrowing and non-allergic wheeze due to increased immune\nresponse to viral infections. These entities represented three\nmechanisms that could contribute to recurrent wheezing diseases\nin young children.\nAlthough there was some disagreement concerning acute viral\nbronchiolitis, panel members agreed that none of the other entities\nthey had originally proposed should be considered as separate\ndisease entities. The consensus was, that some of them represented\nwheezing secondary to underlying conditions with clear diagnoses\n(7, 19, 20 in Table 1), while others were limited to particular\nexposures (15), were poorly defined and outdated (9) or were a\ngeneral sign of inflammation (22).\nDiscussion\nIn this study we aimed to agree on a disease model for wheezing\ndisorders in young children consisting of distinct disease entities\neach based on plausible mechanisms. We wanted this model to be\ndeveloped and agreed upon by clinicians who encounter the full\nrange of clinical presentations of these disorders, working in\nprimary, secondary, and tertiary care. The model is the first step in\na validation study of statistical methods used to identify subgroups\nof disease from epidemiological data.\nTable 1.

Second, we\nfound a broad range of concepts and definitions for different forms\nof childhood wheeze. Among the disease entities proposed by the 6\npanel members subscribing to a multiple-disease view, only a few\nentities were similar across two or more physicians, the best\nagreement being found for the two entities described as \u2018\u2018allergic\nwheeze associated with interval symptoms\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018exclusive viral\nwheeze occurring only during viral infections\u2019\u2019. There was no\nagreement among panel members on the potential number of\ndisease entities. Third, clinicians\u2019 concepts of disease mechanisms\nunderlying wheezing disorders were vague. Except for allergic\nwheeze, which represents the classical asthma phenotype, all panel\nmembers were reluctant to define entities in terms of explicit\nmechanisms, and perceived this task as highly speculative. Fourth,\nit became clear that the clinical information that might be used to\ndistinguish different mechanisms is limited in early childhood. For\ninstance, non-viral triggers that may be important in later years\nare less relevant (aeroallergens) or cannot be assessed (exercise) in\nearly childhood. Also, the possibilities for physiological measure-\nments are restricted in the first few years of life.\nComparison with Literature\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study describing current views\nof clinicians on phenotypes of wheeze in preschool children, and\nthe first which has tried to obtain a consensus among them in\norder to propose a disease model. The final model proposed by the\npanel, and the main mechanisms suggested reflect current\ndiscussions in the literature.\nAllergy. Allergic sensitisation is associated with persistent\nwheeze in childhood but not with early transient wheeze [24,25].\nThere is evidence that allergic sensitisation can begin in infancy, in\nparticular sensitisation to food allergens [26,27,28], however,\nincidence increases markedly after the age of 2\u20133 years mainly due\nto sensitisation to aeroallergens [26]. In children who develop\natopic asthma onset of sensitisation tends to be early [29].\nStructurally narrow airways. Evidence suggests that poor\nlung function in infancy is associated with subsequent early childhood\nFigure 1. Graphical display of disease entities initially suggested by panel members. The figure shows the position of disease entities\ninitially suggested by panel members along the two main axes of variability identified by multiple correspondence analysis. The position of each\nentity is determined by its feature profile (features used by the panel member to describe the entity) such that entities with similar features lie close\ntogether. The numbering follows that used in table 1 and entities suggested by the same panel member are coloured with the same colour. The\nellipses indicate groups of entities which have similar label names but were suggested independently by different panel members. The fact that\nentities within the same ellipse lie close to each other indicates that when different panel members suggested similar labels they also gave a similar\ndescription of the corresponding entities. The initial disease model consisted of 4 entities representing the 4 ellipses.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0008533.g001\nA Model for Childhood Wheezing\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 December 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 12 | e8533\nwheezing [4,30]. Flow limitation can be caused by decreased airway\ndimensions and\/or altered airway wall mechanics [31]. Factors that\ncan lead to such changes in airway structure and\/or function include\nmaternal smoking during pregnancy [32] or preterm birth, even in\nthe absence of neonatal respiratory disease [33,34].\nIncreased immune responsiveness to viral infections.\nWheeze in infancy is predominantly triggered by viral infections\n[35]. The majority of children experience respiratory viral\ninfections in the first years of life and responses vary widely from\nasymptomatic disease in some children, through mild upper\nrespiratory illness in many to severe lower respiratory disease in a\nminority of infants [36]. Host specific factors associated with the\nseverity of this response include mechanical and immunologic\nfactors such as an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 type responses\n[37,38].\nThe disease model proposed by the panel of clinicians is\ntherefore not novel with respect to the hypothesised mechanisms.\nIt is however original in the selection of these particular\nmechanisms as the main sources of heterogeneity in preschool\nwheezing disorders. Other expert-driven attempts to distinguish\nphenotypes of wheeze have mainly been based on long-term\ntemporal patterns (early transient, persistent and late onset\nwheeze) [4,5] or main triggers (viral wheeze, multiple-trigger\nwheeze) [1,2,3].\nStrengths and Limitations of Our Approach\nOur approach brought together a wide range of initial views and\nconcepts from clinicians who encounter the full clinical spectrum of\nwheezing disorders in young children. The panel was heterogenous,\ncomposed of physicians from four different countries, including\nboth paediatric pulmonologists and general practitioners, yet small\nenough to allow a co-ordinated discussion and an agreement on a\nfinal disease model. We included people who have a broad clinical\nexperience and research interests, but who had not been performing\nresearch on phenotypes of childhood wheeze nor were closely\nrelated to a group which had done this. Therefore, our results reflect\na broad range of different opinions from specialists and generalists\nacross different European countries.\nLimitations of this study include small sample size and reliance\non subjective views of individuals. Clearly, sample size is too small\nto represent the full spectrum of views amongst clinicians at large,\nand we cannot know the extent to which the list of initially\nproposed disease concepts is exhaustive. Thus, inclusion of more\nclinicians might have resulted in more initial disease entities, and\nperhaps in a different final disease model. However, our study did\nnot aim to obtain a representative consensus view for the wider\npopulation of clinicians; rather it was an attempt to generate\nhypotheses for further research and discussion. Also, our\nconclusions are not based on objective data, but on the subjective\nviews of clinicians. Clinician\u2019s perceptions represent a synthesis of\ninformation from a wide range of sources including first hand\nclinical observations, but also published literature. We wanted to\ncombine this information to generate a model for wheezing\ndisease. The study was designed as a qualitative and exploratory\nstudy and not as a confirmatory study that would require large\nsamples of preferably objective data.\nTable 2.

Although a great diversity of specific disease\nconcepts exists there is much uncertainty regarding the biological\nmechanisms that could justify them. A major problem is that the\nclinical features observed in this young age group are not specific\nfor later disease course and physiological measurements are\ndifficult.\nWe propose a disease model for wheezing disorders in preschool\nchildren comprising three entities linked to specific mechanisms: a)\nallergic wheeze, b) non-allergic wheeze due to structural airway\nnarrowing and c) non-allergic wheeze due to increased immune\nresponse to viral infections. Further research is needed to\ndetermine whether or not these mechanisms are major causes of\nwheezing in early childhood. The proposed model may be useful\nfor designing future studies so that hypothesised mechanisms are\nmeasured at the right time. Few epidemiological studies to date\nhave collected data prospectively and at frequent intervals on the\nearly development of atopic sensitisation (for instance [39]) or on\nfactors related to increased responsiveness to viral infections in\nearly life [4,30,40,41]. Prospective studies including repeated\nmeasurements of lung mechanics and physiology during infancy\nand childhood in representative cohorts of children are almost\nentirely lacking. There is an urgent need to develop non-invasive\nmeasurements of lung function that can be applied at all ages.\nOnly this will allow these hypothesised entities, assuming that they\ndo exist to be disentangled.\nIf confirmed, these different causes of wheezing may have\nimportant implications for treatment. Wheeze due to structural\nairway narrowing might be a self limited disease, the natural\ncourse of which may not be influenced by treatment. These\nchildren are likely to outgrow their symptoms as their airways\nincrease in size with growth. However, because relative differences\nmay persist throughout life, relapse may occur in later adulthood\nas elastic recoil decreases and lung function declines. The greatest\npotential for disease modification by treatment is certainly for\nallergic wheeze, but also, potentially, for the hypothesised entity\n\u2018\u2018non-allergic wheeze due to increased immune responses to viral\ninfections\u2019\u2019.\nAs our study has shown, there is a clear need for a\nstandardisation of phenotype definitions. Ultimately such a\nclassification should be based on an understanding of the\npathogenesis of different disease entities.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Philipp Latzin for critically reviewing an earlier version\nof the manuscript.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: BS MS CEK.
