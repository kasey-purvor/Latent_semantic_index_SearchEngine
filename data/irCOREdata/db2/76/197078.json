There was a small (0.08 points on a 5 point scale) but significant (P<0.01) effect in favour of the SPI1 hospitals in one of 11 dimensions of the staff questionnaire (organisational climate). Qualitative evidence showed only modest penetration of SPI1 at medical ward level. Although SPI1 was designed to engage staff from the bottom up, it did not usually feel like this to those working on the wards, and questions about legitimacy of some aspects of SPI1 were raised. Of the five components to identify patients at risk of deterioration\u2014monitoring of vital signs (14 items); routine tests (three items); evidence based standards specific to certain diseases (three items); prescribing errors (multiple items from the British National Formulary); and medical history taking (11 items)\u2014there was little net difference between control and SPI1 hospitals, except in relation to quality of monitoring of acute medical patients, which improved on average over time across all hospitals. Recording of respiratory rate increased to a greater degree in SPI1 than in control hospitals; in the second six hours after admission recording increased from 40% (93) to 69% (165) in control hospitals and from 37% (141) to 78% (296) in SPI1 hospitals (odds ratio for \u201cdifference in difference\u201d 2.1, 99% confidence interval 1.0 to 4.3; P=0.008). Use of a formal scoring system for patients with pneumonia also increased over time (from 2% (102) to 23% (111) in control hospitals and from 2% (170) to 9% (189) in SPI1 hospitals), which favoured controls and was not significant (0.3, 0.02 to 3.4; P=0.173). There were no improvements in the proportion of prescription errors and no effects that could be attributed to SPI1 in non-targeted generic areas (such as enhanced safety culture). On some measures, the lack of effect could be because compliance was already high at baseline (such as use of steroids in over 85% of cases where indicated), but even when there was more room for improvement (such as in quality of medical history taking), there was no significant additional net effect of SPI1. There were no changes over time or between control and SPI1 hospitals in errors or rates of adverse events in patients in medical wards. Mortality increased from 11% (27) to 16% (39) among controls and decreased from 17% (63) to 13% (49) among SPI1 hospitals, but the risk adjusted difference was not significant (0.5, 0.2 to 1.4; P=0.085).

There was a small (0.08 points on a 5 point scale) but significant (P<0.01) effect in favour of the SPI1 hospitals in one of 11 dimensions of the staff questionnaire (organisational climate). Qualitative evidence showed only modest penetration of SPI1 at medical ward level. Although SPI1 was designed to engage staff from the bottom up, it did not usually feel like this to those working on the wards, and questions about legitimacy of some aspects of SPI1 were raised. Of the five components to identify patients at risk of deterioration\u2014monitoring of vital signs (14 items); routine tests (three items); evidence based standards specific to certain diseases (three items); prescribing errors (multiple items from the British National Formulary); and medical history taking (11 items)\u2014there was little net difference between control and SPI1 hospitals, except in relation to quality of monitoring of acute medical patients, which improved on average over time across all hospitals. Recording of respiratory rate increased to a greater degree in SPI1 than in control hospitals; in the second six hours after admission recording increased from 40% (93) to 69% (165) in control hospitals and from 37% (141) to 78% (296) in SPI1 hospitals (odds ratio for \u201cdifference in difference\u201d 2.1, 99% confidence interval 1.0 to 4.3; P=0.008). Use of a formal scoring system for patients with pneumonia also increased over time (from 2% (102) to 23% (111) in control hospitals and from 2% (170) to 9% (189) in SPI1 hospitals), which favoured controls and was not significant (0.3, 0.02 to 3.4; P=0.173). There were no improvements in the proportion of prescription errors and no effects that could be attributed to SPI1 in non-targeted generic areas (such as enhanced safety culture). On some measures, the lack of effect could be because compliance was already high at baseline (such as use of steroids in over 85% of cases where indicated), but even when there was more room for improvement (such as in quality of medical history taking), there was no significant additional net effect of SPI1. There were no changes over time or between control and SPI1 hospitals in errors or rates of adverse events in patients in medical wards. Mortality increased from 11% (27) to 16% (39) among controls and decreased from 17% (63) to 13% (49) among SPI1 hospitals, but the risk adjusted difference was not significant (0.5, 0.2 to 1.4; P=0.085).

Approaches to patient safety that aim\nto intervene at an organisational level and that actively\nengage workers in the management of risk are argued\nto be especially promising for providing solutions to\nthe problems of patient safety.4 5 The Health Founda-\ntion\u2019s Safer Patients Initiative (SPI) was an important\nexample of such an approach.\nThe Safer Patients Initiative programme\nTheHealthFoundation selected four hospitals (table1),\none in each country of the United Kingdom, to partici-\npate in the first phase of SPI (SPI1). 6 The Health Foun-\ndation (a British charity dedicated to improving the\nquality of healthcare) invested \u00a3775 000 (\u20ac900 000,\n$1.2m) in each hospital. SPI1 ran from January 2005\nto September 2006 inclusive and was intended to\nembed and spread thereafter. The Health Foundation\nissued a request for applications to conduct an indepen-\ndent evaluation of the SPI1 intervention.We report on\nthe results of this evaluation.\nSPI1 set out to secure improvements in patient\nsafety7-9 and covered a range of aims (box 1), which\nincluded a 50% reduction in adverse events.10 Men-\ntored by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement\n(IHI), based in theUnited States, it had several features\nsimilar to the well publicised US \u201cSaving 100,000 lives\ncampaign.\u201d11 12 The intervention consisted of many\ncomponents (box 1), some generic (aimed at strength-\nening the organisation as a whole) and others targeted\nat specific high risk clinical issues. The generic compo-\nnents sought to promote patient safety as an organisa-\ntional priority, increase the effectiveness of senior\nleadership in relation to safety, engender a culture of\nsafety, and instil knowledge of the principles of safe\npractice among staff. The targeted components of\nSPI1 focused on improving the reliability of specific\nfrontline care processes in designated clinical areas\n(general wards, critical care, perioperative care, and\nmanagement of medicines).\nFrom each hospital, 15-20 \u201cchange agents\u201d partici-\npated in four learning sessions run by the IHI to gain\nknowledge and expertise in how to change practice,\nmeasure the effects, and sustain safety\nimprovements.7-9 Change agents were charged with\nleading change by facilitating the implementation of\nSPI1 in their hospitals. They also formed a virtual com-\nmunity that shared data, tools, expertise, and experi-\nence; participated in conference calls and electronic\nmailing lists; and uploaded monthly progress reports\nthrough a project intranet.\nSPI1 hospitals received site visits and technical assis-\ntance from the IHI over the course of the programme,\nand staff members in participating hospitals were\nasked to take part in surveys of safety culture managed\nby the IHI. Changes in clinical processes were sup-\nported by learning materials (such as care \u201cbundles,\u201d\ncollections of carefully packaged evidence based stan-\ndards directed at a particular condition or clinical sce-\nnario) (box 1). The intention was to encourage\ncompliance with the tenets of safe and effective care\nby using Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles, where\nchanges are first implemented on a small scale and\ntested and refined before being rolled out on a larger\nscale. The programme strongly emphasised the role of\nmeasurement in improving patient safety. Staff mem-\nbers were expected to upload time series process data\n(such as compliance with prophylaxis for deep vein\nthrombosis) to the project intranet to create run\ncharts\u2014graphs to help people visualise changes on\nselected measures over time. Monitoring of care pro-\ncesses through these charts was seen as important for\nguiding local improvement activities and evaluating\ntheir impact.\nStudy aims\nWeevaluated changes in a range of end points relevant\nto patient safety over time and whether these changes\ncould be attributed to SPI1 in the four participating\nhospitals. We used a controlled design to identify\nwhether SPI1 had any additional effect (that is, net of\nany overall trends in hospital safety over the same per-\niod).\nWe have reported here on themethods used and the\nmain findings based on SQUIRE guidelines.13 Further\ndetails are available in the full online report.6 The eva-\nluation of the rollout of SPI to other hospitals (SPI2) is\navailable in a companion paper.14\nMETHODS\nFramework for evaluation\nThe study was a \u201cmixed method\u201d evaluation1516\nbecause it combined qualitative and quantitative data\nand involved many \u201clevels\u201d in the organisation, \u201cfrom\nboardroom to patient.\u201d15-19 This type of evaluation is\nparticularly suitable for service delivery\/management\ninterventions that are not likely to yield the type of con-\nclusive results characteristic of evaluations of treat-\nments based on measurement of outcomes on\npatients.20 Mixed method evaluation draws on the\nidea of \u201ctriangulation,\u201d where confidence in the find-\nings increases when observations of one type are cor-\nroborated by other types of evidence. This follows a\ntradition in the philosophy of science.15-19 Figure 1\nshows the framework for the evaluation.\nTable 1 | NHS hospitals* that participated in phase one of Safer Patients Initiative (SPI1)\nHospital\nnumber\nRural\/\nurban Noofbeds Teaching status A and E ICU\nFTE consultant\n(specialists)\n1 Urban 625 Associate teaching hospital Yes Yes 112\n2 Rural 750 No Yes Yes 120\n3 Urban 903 Principal teaching hospital Yes Yes 242\n4 Rural 280 No Yes No 36\nA and E=accident and emergency department; FTE=full time equivalent; ICU=intensive care unit.\n*National Health Service hospital, with no private beds.

For economy, the con-\ntrol hospitals comprised nine that would later\nparticipate in the second phase of SPI (SPI2) but were\npre-intervention at the timeof this study.A further nine\ncontrols were added that would also form the controls\nfor the SPI2 hospitals.14 All 18 control hospitals were\nlocated in England (thereby providing access to the\nNHS staff and patient surveys).\nUse of before and after observations across control\nand SPI1 sites enabled us to compare rates of change\nacross control and SPI1 hospitals over time. This\napproach, known as the \u201cdifference in difference\u201d\nmethod,18 is particularly suitable for identifying tem-\nporal variations in outcomes that are not due to expo-\nsure to the intervention that is being evaluated, and is\nused to take into account the effect of events other than\nthe particular intervention of interest that occur over\nthe intervention period.\nInterviews with strategic\/senior staff\nUsing semistructured telephone interviews with 60\nhospital staff members in strategic\/senior positions\nacross the four hospitals, we investigated how far\nparticipants understood and expressed enthusiasm\nfor the SPI1.

Data analysis was first based on the\nconstant comparative method that was used to gener-\nate thematic categories into which participants\u2019\naccounts could be categorised.21 Three independent\nreviewers then scored the responses of hospital partici-\npants on a 1-10 scale for level of knowledge and level of\nenthusiasm.\nStaff survey\nThe National NHS Staff Survey questionnaire was\nused at two time points to measure variables such as\nstaff morale, attitudes, and aspects of \u201cculture\u201d that\nmight be affected by the generic strengthening of orga-\nnisational systems that SPI1 intended to achieve. Ele-\nven of the 28 survey questions (table 3)22-26 were\nidentified as likely to be of relevance. Questionnaires\nwere sent to all staff members in the four SPI1 hospi-\ntals, including the three hospitals outside England that\ndid not routinely participate in the National NHS Staff\nSurvey. In each of the 18 control hospitals, a simple\nrandom sample of 850 staff members was used; at this\nsample size, an average 60% response rate would yield\n95% confidence intervals of no greater than 10% for all\nscores in a single organisation. Further detail about the\nquestionnaire is available from www.nhsstaffsurveys.\ncom, and further detail about the evaluation is in the\nfull report. 6 Statistical analyses were adjusted for age,\nsex, ethnic background, occupational group, length of\nservice, and management status.\nQualitative study\nOne author (AS) undertook three rounds of data col-\nlection. Between April and September 2006, she vis-\nited one medical ward in each of the four hospitals for\none week. She undertook around 150 hours of ethno-\ngraphic observations and 47 interviews with different\ntypes of ward staff, focusing on general issues relating\nto patient safety and SPI1. The wards were selected on\nthe basis that they would treat many of the patients\nwhose case notes would be reviewed (see below), but\nnot on the basis that SPI1 \u201cchange agents\u201d (see box 1)\nwere necessarily active on these wards. From April to\nJune 2007, shortly after the intervention phase, a sec-\nond week-long visit to each ward involved a further\nround of ethnographic observations (around 150\nhours) and 41 interviews. A third visit involving three\nfocus groups at each site (one at study ward level, one\ninvolving people with responsibilities for patient\nsafety\/SPI1, and one at strategic level) was used to\nfeed back preliminary findings and to ask staff for\ntheir reflections on SPI1.

| ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 5 of 14\nMay-July 2008 by two of the authors (AS andUG) and\none researcher (JW).\nData analysis of interviews was based on the con-\nstant comparative method,21 facilitated by the use of\nNVivo software. For focus groups and ethnographic\nfield notes, simple coding procedures were used to\ncategorise the data thematically.\nQuality of care\/error rates in patients with acute\nrespiratory disease on medical wards\nUsing case note review, we assessed quality of care\nusing standards based on established guidelines wher-\never possible. We reviewed case notes from patients\nwith similar clinical conditions across the SPI1 and\ncontrol hospitals so that we could compare like with\nlike. Case note review is resource intensive and thus\nmust be selective. We focused on patients aged over\n65with acute respiratory disease (community acquired\npneumonia, exacerbation of asthma, or chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease) admitted to medical\nwards (one in each participating hospital) (box 2).\nThe review assessed processes targeted by SPI1 (such\nas quality of observations to detect deteriorating\npatients) and those that might be expected to improve\nif there was an overall shift in organisational systems\nand culture toward patient safety (such as improved\nmedical histories).\nCase notes from the 18 control and four SPI1 hospi-\ntals were collected from two periods of six months,\nwhich we termed epochs. Epoch 1 (October 2003 to\nMarch 2004) was before the intervention and epoch 2\n(October 2006 to March 2007) was after.\nWe aimed to analyse 100 sets of case notes fromeach\nSPI1 hospital per epoch (800 in total) and 15 from each\ncontrol hospital per epoch (540 in total). This would\ngive 80% power to detect a 13 percentage point\nimprovement in error rates from a baseline of 70% at\nP=0.05 (see full report for further details).6 For each set\nof case notes, the admissions of interestwere photocop-\nied, anonymised, and digitised and the year of admis-\nsion was removed to ensure blinding to epoch. These\nprocesses were completed before reviewing. Review\nwas both explicit (criterion based) and implicit (holis-\ntic) because each method identifies a different spec-\ntrum of errors.30\nCriterion based review\u2014Qualified pharmacists (MG\nand BDF) conducted explicit reviews according to pre-\ndefined criteria relating to deterioration of the patient;\nmedical history taking; compliance with evidence\nbased care; and prescribing errors (table 4). To control\nfor any learning or fatigue effects, or both, in reviewers,\ncase notes were scrambled to ensure that they were not\nreviewed entirely in series. Agreement on prescribing\nerror between observers35 was evaluated by assigning\none in 10 sets of case notes to both reviewers, who\nassessed cases in batches, blinded to each other\u2019s\nassessments, but compared and discussed results after\neach batch. Data were collected on the adequacy of\nmasking of patients\u2019 names, hospital, and epoch. All\nanalyses were adjusted for patient level covariates of\nage and sex. We used cubic polynomials in the time\nof review to adjust for learning\/fatigue effects in the\nreview process.\nHolistic review\u2014Holistic review was not part of the\noriginal protocol (for either SPI1 or SPI2) but was car-\nried out after a suggestion by the late Vin McLoughlin\n(a director of the Health Foundation) in November\nBox 2: Rationale for focus on patients aged over 65 admitted with acute respiratory\ndisease\n\u0001 It was important to focus on an issue where all four SPI1 hospitals would be\nimplementing a specific SPI intervention (intensive care was excluded partly for this\nreason)\n\u0001 There is a high incidence of comorbidities in people aged over 65, making this a high\nrisk and hence a potentially error-rich population in which an effective organisational\npatient safety intervention might yield detectable improvements. Improving\nrecognition and response to acute deterioration was a specific target of the SPI (see\nbox 1), and patients admitted with acute respiratory disease are at high risk of such\ndeterioration2728\n\u0001 There was evidence that monitoring and medication practice was suboptimal in NHS\nhospitals, thus providing sufficient room for improvements to be detected with\nsamples of affordable size29\n\u0001 A single set of case notes could be used to assess end points targeted by several SPI\ninterventions (see box 1), specifically including management of patients at risk of\ndeterioration and prescribing errors\nTable 4 | Explicit case note review in phase one of Safer Patients Initiative (SPI1): areas of review, source of criteria, method for assessment of errors, and\nrelevant SPI target\nArea of review Source of criteria How it was assessed Specific SPI goal\nClinical observations and signs\nof patient deterioration\nBritish Thoracic Society\n(BTS)31 32\nCompleteness with which patients\u2019 vital signs were recorded (table 5) evaluated on admission and then\nfor first and subsequent 6 hour time periods.

A specialist in gen-\neral medicine (MC) holistically evaluated each set of\ncase notes to identify errors in the care of patients and\nadverse events. To measure reliability between\nobservers,35 an experienced trainee in respiratory\nmedicine (TN) independently re-evaluated a subset of\nthese case notes (n=91). Error was defined, according\nto Reason, as \u201ca failure to complete a planned action as\nit was intended or adoption of an incorrect plan.\u201d36 The\nresults, adjusted for age and sex, are presented as the\naverage number of errors per 100 patients; a patient\ncould have more than one error. Errors were cate-\ngorised as relating to diagnosis on admission; hospital\nacquired infection; technical\/management; medica-\ntion\/maintenance\/test results; clinical reasoning; and\ndischarge information.37-41 Reviewers also gave an\noverall rating of the quality of care.6\nOutcomes\nAdverse events\u2014The holistic review of case notes identi-\nfied adverse events related to healthcare, which were\nreported as a rate of total adverse events per 100\npatients. An adverse event was defined as \u201can unin-\ntended injury or complication which results in disabil-\nity, death or prolonged hospital stay and which is\ncaused by healthcare management.\u201d38 Reviewers clas-\nsified adverse events (including those resulting in\ndeath) by degree of preventability (on the balance of\nprobabilities). Adjustments weremade for age and sex.\nMortality\u2014Overall adjusted (or crude) hospital mor-\ntality rates for all four SPI1 hospitals were not available\nbecause of difficulty accessing this information from\nthe non-English countries.

The dates of the surveys of\npatients were aligned with the dates of staff surveys.6\nFive scores were identified for analysis: three related\nto overall satisfaction scores and two to cleanliness.\nData in the control arm were available only at the\nlevel of the organisation (hospital), not at the level of\nthe individual clinical directorate (medicine, surgery,\netc). Thus the analysis was conducted at the organisa-\ntional level throughout. In the SPI1 arm, organisation\nlevel scoreswere formed by averaging all respondents\u2019\nscores in each hospital.\nStatistical methods\nWe used generalised linear mixed models for formal\nstatistical analyses. Fixed effects were included for the\ndifference in levels before the intervention between\ncontrol and SPI1 hospitals (\u201cbaseline comparisons\u201d);\nthe change over time in control hospitals between the\nperiod before (epoch 1) and after (epoch 2) the inter-\nvention; and the effect of SPI1, interpreted as the dis-\ncrepancy between the temporal changes experienced\nover the two epochs in the control and SPI1 hospitals.\nThe impact of intraclass correlation in before and after\nstudies is lower than for cross sectional studies.18 45\nNevertheless, we took into account the effect of hospi-\ntal level clustering by including randomeffects for each\nhospital.\nWe used logistic models for binary responses; Pois-\nson models for adverse events and general care errors;\nnegative binomial models for medication errors (per\nrecorded prescription); and normal models in all\nother cases. No adjustments were made for multiple\ncomparisons, but we used 99% confidence intervals\nthroughout and significance was set at P<0.01. Agree-\nment between observers was tested with the intraclass\ncorrelation coefficient for rating scales and the \u03ba statis-\ntic for dichotomous judgments. All models were fitted\nin Stata v10.\nRESULTS\nSenior\/strategic staff interviews\nInterviews with senior\/strategic hospital staff in the\nSPI1 hospitals showed that they were mainly positive\nabout SPI1 and had considerable enthusiasm for the\ninitiative and its principles. Only seven of the 60\nparticipants were unable to describe SPI1 accurately\nor in detail.8 Even though there was a broadly shared\nunderstanding of the programme\u2019s theory of change\n(what the intervention was intended to achieve and\nwith what methods), there was less evidence of an\nexplicit and shared organisational theory of change\n(what was needed to make the programme work at an\norganisational level and how programme implementa-\ntion could be optimised). Despite their enthusiasm,\nhospital staff members expressed multiple concerns\nabout the ambitious reach of the programme, whether\nresourceswould be equal to the demands, andwhether\nresistance might be encountered at the \u201csharp end\u201d46\nwhere staff care for patients. Strategies for overcoming\nsuch difficulties were not clear in the accounts of stake-\nholders.\nThe quantitative analysis found that 73% scored\nabove 5 (out of 10) on the knowledge scale and 83%\nscored above 5 (out of 10) on the enthusiasm scale\n(fig 2). Correlations between knowledge and enthu-\nsiasm across the three raters were 0.61, 0.69, and\n0.91. Reliability between raters was medium to high,\nwith intraclass correlations of 0.55 for knowledge and\n0.65 for enthusiasm.\nStaff survey\nThere was no significant difference in response rates\nbetween control and SPI1 hospitals at baseline, and\nthe hospitals were broadly similar with respect to mor-\nale, attitudes, and culture of the hospital staff at base-\nline. Table 3 shows the changes in control and SPI1\nhospitals on each of 11 scores, along with the differ-\nences between groups. The difference was significant\nfor only one of the 11 scores (organisational climate)\n(P<0.01), favouring the SPI1 hospitals over controls.\nThere was a modest effect size for the difference in\nchange between the control and SPI1 hospitals after\ncovariates were taken into account: 0.08 points on a 5\npoint scale where there was a range at baseline of 0.50\npoints between hospitals.\nQualitative study\nThe focus groups in fourmedical wards across the four\nsites agreed that the senior staff members in the hospi-\ntalswere committed and enthusiastic about SPI1,made\na significant strategic contribution, gave weight to the\ninitiative, and generally set a good example for staff.\nTable 6 | Compliance with particular standards (such as use of steroids when indicated) before (epoch 1) and after (epoch 2)\nphase one of Safer Patients Initiative (SPI1).

There\nwas little evidence that frontlinemedicalward staff per-\nceived a sense of ownership over the initiative. The\nperception existed among some that SPI1 had allowed\na small number of people to become an elite group\nwith enhanced career prospects, while others were\nleft feeling excluded.\n\u201cSPI was a select group of twenty people . . . you\u2019re\nstarting off in small areas and of course the by-product\nof that is that you\u2019ve got a small group dealing with\nthose small areas so there is, although we may not\nlike it, there is a perception in some parts of the orga-\nnisation that SPI is a, an elite entity.\u201d\nThe gap between the strategic level view and what\nwas happening at the sharp end was evident in several\ndifferent ways. For example, \u201cleadership walk rounds\u201d\nwere discussed enthusiastically in the leadership focus\ngroups, but some staff members at the sharp end\nthought that the process was disappointing and might\neven have undermined SPI1 because it sometimes\nseemed to show a failure to connect senior manage-\nment with the wards in meaningful ways.\n\u201cWell he came around and spoke to a few people and\njust asked about any concerns. He said he was inter-\nested to know how the nursing staff felt and he wanted\nto know one thing that he could take back to the rest of\nthe board about any issues that nursing staff had.After-\nwards they sent a letter to say thanks but you never\nhear any . . . well we haven\u2019t heard anything more\nthan that so.\u201d\nSeveral PDSA \u201csuccess stories\u201dwere reported in the\nfocus groups. Few of the frontline ward staff members\ninterviewed, however, seemed aware of PDSA cycles.\nSomewhere between the blunt end and the sharp end,\nthe model of participative engagement on which SPI1\nwas based had got rather lost, at least in relation to\nmedical wards. There were several important influ-\nences that determined the extent to which SPI1 inter-\nventions became embedded on these wards. One\nexample was intensity of the \u201cdose\u201d of SPI1 given to\nthe wards. The activities of SPI1 change agents were\ndispersed throughout hospitals, and they might have\nfocused their efforts on the more well defined clinical\nareas (such as the intensive care unit) that were the sub-\nject of clinical processes targeted by SPI1.\n\u201cThe ward aspect was one of themore difficult areas to\nimplement because it wasn\u2019t as sort of specific, as con-\nfined, whereas the other areas perhaps were confined\nto theatres or ICU. [The ward] was much more . . .\nnebulous and covered a much bigger area . . . than\nperhaps other parts of the SPI.\u201d\nA further issue was legitimacy. Sometimes staff sim-\nply did not see particular interventions as being scien-\ntifically legitimate.\n\u201cSomething that appears on the surface very simple,\nlike the definition of a surgical infection, caused an\nabsolute riot.\u201d\nScientific legitimacy debates were, perhaps para-\ndoxically, exacerbated by the use of PDSA cycles.\nSome clinical staff members reported seeing the run-\nchart data collected during the cycles as unreliable and\nlacking in credibility and therefore as not providing\nenough of a prompt for change. Claims of problematic\nevidence, however, might have been used strategically\nas a means of resisting change and reinforcing inertia.\nLegitimacy issues also arose when staff members did\nnot recognise that the problem being tackled was a\n\u201creal\u201d one requiring a particular response, or they did\nnot consider that the resources that would be required\nto implement the intervention were legitimate in light\nof other priorities and pressures. We observed further\nbarriers to adopting safety initiatives, including the\ninstability of teams caused by rotating and agency\nstaff, meaning it was difficult to sustain a collective\nknowledge and faith in SPI1 over time.\nPositive impacts of SPI1 included increasedmanage-\nrial recognition and focus on patient safety and the pro-\nmotion of a systematic approach.

There was a perception that hospitals had\nunderestimated this and been too ready to assume that\nsomething that worked in a defined clinical area (such\nas intensive care units) would easily transfer to other\nenvironments or would spontaneously spread. Hospi-\ntals reported that they had begun to devise strategies\nfor future implementation, which included engaging\nsenior clinicians and encouraging local ownership.\nQuality of care\/error rates in patients with acute\nrespiratory disease on medical wards\nExplicit review of case notes\nThe smallest SPI1 hospital in our sample could not\nprovide the target numbers of case notes, leading to a\nslight shortfall in the intended SPI1 sample size of 400\nsets of case notes in each epoch: 381 in epoch 1 and 380\nin epoch 2. Control hospitals yielded 236 sets of case\nnotes in epoch 1 and 240 sets in epoch 2. Baseline com-\nparisons across all 1237 sets showed no significant dif-\nferences between the control and SPI1 hospitals for\nany of the explicit review measures (table 4) assessed\nagainst the predetermined criteria.\nCompliance in recording patients\u2019 observations at\nboth six and 12 hours after admission improvedmark-\nedly between the two epochs, and this was significant\nfor all but one of eight possible items. Both control and\nSPI1 hospitals improved, though the improvement\nwas greater in SPI1 hospitals (table 5); this difference\nin difference was significant only for the recording of\nrespiratory rate at 12 hours. There was also a consider-\nable increase over time in use of theCURB (confusion\/\nurea\/respiratory rate\/blood pressure) score in patients\nwith pneumonia, but these differences were not signif-\nicant between control and SPI1 hospitals, and the point\nestimate favoured controls (table 6).\nThere were many prescribing errors, but these were\nmostly minor (table 7). There were no significant\neffects of SPI1 either over time or in favour of SPI in\nquality of prescribing (error rate ratio (estimated from\npopulation averaged negative binomialmodel) 1.2, 0.9\nto 1.8; P=0.138).\nThe quality of observations, risk assessment, and\nprescribing were SPI1 targets (box 1), but we also\nsought evidence of a \u201chalo effect\u201d that might be evi-\ndence of a general strengthening of the system. There\nwas no evidence of improvement in adherence to var-\nious tenets of safe evidence based practice (table 6)\neither over time or in SPI1 hospitals in particular.\nCompliance with certain standards (such as use of ster-\noids when indicated) was already high (over 85%) at\nbaseline in both sets of hospitals, leaving little room\nfor further improvement. The quality of history taking\nremained stable over time in both control and SPI1\nhospitals (table 8).\nA comparison of the prescribing error results\nshowed substantial35 agreement between the two\nobservers, with a \u03ba of 0.71 and 0.70 in epochs 1 and\n2, respectively. For some items\u2014notably prescribing\nerrors (table 7) and recording of exercise tolerance\nand chest pain (table 8)\u2014the time in the sequence\nwhen the review of the case notes was conducted\nmade a significant contribution to the recorded out-\ncome.

For the 18 control hospitals,\nnumbers were 243 and 246, respectively (range 8-15\ncases per hospital). The total number of case notes\n(1260) is slightly different to the number in the explicit\nreview because not all notes had been sent for both\ntypes of review when the study \u201cclosed.\u201d Both\nreviewers assessed 91 sets of case notes; measures of\nreliability between them were, as expected for holistic\nreviews,30 low (\u03ba=0.15, SE 0.08).\nA total of 425 errors were identified. The most com-\nmon categories of errors related to diagnosis, assess-\nment, or admission or to poor clinical reasoning.\nFrom epoch 1 to 2, error rates declined from 44.4 to\n42.3 in control hospitals and from 29.7 to 24.4 in the\nSPI1 hospitals. The difference in changes across con-\ntrol and SPI1 hospitals was not significant (rate ratio\n0.87, 99% confidence interval 0.52 to 1.44; P=0.48).\nOutcomes\nAdverse events\nThe holistic review of the 1260 case notes identified 56\nadverse events across all epochs and hospitals, giving\nan overall adverse event rate of about four per 100\npatients treated. Agreement between raters in identifi-\ncation of adverse events was somewhat higher than\nagreement in identification of errors by holistic review\n(\u03ba=0.25). The adverse event rate increased from 2.9 to\n4.8 per 100 patients in control hospitals and declined\nfrom 6.2 to 3.7 among SPI1 hospitals. This difference\nin changes across control and SPI1 hospitals was not\nsignificant (rate ratio 0.40, 0.09 to 1.84; P=0.12).\nIn about a quarter (16) of the adverse events, there\nexisted strong or certain evidence that the event was\npreventable (box 3). At around 1.3% (16\/1260), this\nis a somewhat lower rate of preventable adverse events\nthan reported for hospital inpatients elsewhere.40\nMortality\nThemortality rate among patients admitted tomedical\nwards was high, at over 14% (178 deaths across 1237\nsets of case notes included in the explicit review), but\nthere were no significant differences between control\nand SPI1 hospitals in the adjusted mortality rates. The\nbaseline comparisons showed no significant differ-\nences between control and SPI1 hospitals nor was\nthere significant evidence of temporal change in the\ncontrol hospitals (table 9). When we adjusted figures\nfor age, sex, and number of comorbidities in the analy-\nsis of mortality rates the odds ratios were 1.9 (99% con-\nfidence interval 0.6 to 5.6; P=0.149) for the baseline\ncomparison, 1.4 (0.7 to 2.9; P=0.274) for the change\nin control hospitals, and 0.5 (0.2 to 1.4; P=085) for the\neffect of SPI1. There was no significant effect of sex or\nnumber of comorbidities on mortality, but the odds of\ndeath increased by 8% (5% to 11%) per year of patient\nage (P<0.001).

In the 18 control hospitals there was\na greater fall, from 63% (9563\/15274) to 56% (8590\/\n15300). At baseline there were no significant differ-\nences between control and SPI1 hospitals on any of\nthe scores. Only one of the patient satisfaction scores\n(cleanliness of bathrooms) showed a significantly dif-\nferent change (favouring SPI1) (table 10).\nDISCUSSION\nMain findings\nPhase one of the Safer Patients Initiative (SPI1) was\ngenerally greeted enthusiastically at the strategic level\n(blunt end) in participating hospitals. Ethnographic\nobservations and interviews, however, suggested that\nstaff at the sharp end of medical wards generally had\nonly a vague idea of the intervention, and that, with the\nexception of patientmonitoring, few had direct experi-\nence of most of its components. Only one of the 11\ndimensions on the staff survey changed significantly\nbetween groups; this occurred on an item relating to\norganisational climate, which favoured the SPI. Quan-\ntitative evaluation showed a significant effect in favour\nof SPI1 in respect of only one clinical process. This\nexception was in relation to the aim of improving\nobservation of acutely ill patients, where recording of\nrespiratory rate improved significantly more in SPI1\nthan in control hospitals. This quantitative finding\nwas consistent with the qualitative observations.\nDuring the study there was a general improvement\nin the quality of the monitoring of vital signs among\nboth control and SPI1 hospitals; there was improve-\nment in all eight of the required measurements of\nvital signs over the first 12 hours after admission (and\nthis was significant in all but one case). The magnitude\nof the improvement in monitoring respiratory rate\nfrom before to after the intervention was greater than\nthe magnitude of the difference between control and\nSPI1 hospitals. Likewise there was a sharp improve-\nment over time in use of formal risk scoring for patients\nwith pneumonia. These findings are all consistent with\na general (temporal) improvement in the quality of\nmonitoring for sick patients in the NHS over the\nstudy period.\nWe observed several clinical processes that were not\nspecific SPI1 targets but might have been expected to\nimprove if the overall goal of strengthening the system\nand achieving cultural and organisational realign-\nments around safety had been achieved on medical\nwards. There was no significant difference between\ncontrol and SPI1 hospitals over time. For some mea-\nsures\u2014such as use of corticosteroids in patients with\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma\u2014\npractice was already good at baseline and there was\nlittle room for further improvement. There was, how-\never, also no change in other measures of quality of\ncare, even when there was greater room for improve-\nment. The holistic review corroborated findings from\nthe criterion based explicit review, showing no consis-\ntent trends in either errors or adverse events inmedical\nwards treatingpatientswith acute respiratorydisease in\ncontrol versus SPI1 hospitals.\nStrengths and weaknesses\nOur study had several strengths, including use of a pre-\ndefined protocol, selected competitively, for evaluat-\ning SPI1. We quantified safety practices and used\nindependent reviewers who made observations across\nmultiple hospitals. Breaking the link between reviewer\nand hospital removes vested interest and ensures that\nanymeasurement error is systematic, thereby reducing\nrisk of bias in comparisons between institutions.\nReviewers were masked (as further insurance against\nobserver bias), and we quality assured the masking\nprocess. We measured learning\/fatigue effects (not\njust variation between observations)30 to ensure that\ncomparisons were not biased over time. Qualitative\nand quantitative observations across the different\nlevels of hospitals enabled \u201ctriangulation\u201d48 of data col-\nlection and interpretation. We used a before and after\ncontrolled design and \u201cdifference in difference\u201d\napproach to quantitative measurements.15 With some\nnotable exceptions49 50 most quality improvement\nreports lack contemporaneous controls, thus denying\nTable 10 | Patient survey scores* in control and SPI1 hospitals before (survey 1) and after (survey 2) phase one of Safer Patients Initiative (SPI1)\nControl hospitals SPI1 hospitals\nRange at\nbaseline\nEffects of SPI1\u2021\n(99% CI), P value\nNo of\npatients\nSurvey\n1\nSurvey\n2\u2020\nAbsolute\n%change\nNo of\npatients\nSurvey\n1\nSurvey\n2\u2020\nAbsolute\n%change\nOverall, how would you rate the care you\nreceived?\n9209 79 77 \u22122 2325 77 76 \u22121 71-83 1 (\u22121 to 3), 0.330\nOverall, did you feel you were treated with\nrespect and dignity while youwere in hospital?\n9213 89 87 \u22121 2370 88 86 \u22122 84-91 \u22121 (\u22122 to 1), 0.269\nHow would you rate how well doctors and\nnurses worked together?\n9161 78 76 \u22122 2360 76 75 \u22121 72-82 1 (\u22121 to 3), 0.135\nIn your opinion, how clean was hospital room\nor ward that you were in?\n9323 82 80 \u22121 2395 79 79 0 71-89 1 (\u22121 to 4), 0.288\nHowcleanwere toilets andbathroomsthat you\nused in hospital?\n9147 79 77 \u22122 2302 74 76 1 69-86 3 (0 to 6), 0.009\n*Mean values of the five survey scores in control and SPI1 hospitals for first and second patient surveys, rated between 0-100.\n\u2020After intervention\n\u2021Values >1 favour SPI1.\nRESEARCH\npage 12 of 14 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\nthe ability to be confident in determining whether any\nchanges can be attributed to the intervention.\nThese strengthsmean that this evaluation adds to the\nscience of evaluating large scale, complex quality\nimprovement interventions that defy rigorous assess-\nment with single method or single measure designs.\nOur approach dealt with the problems of data quality\nand other biases associated with using hospitals\u2019 own\nSPI1 run-charts, which are not designed for research\npurposes. A separate study has shown that data are\nnot collected in a consistently defined way and tend\nto have missing values.51\nOne limitation of our study is that it was non-rando-\nmised. Results might have been biased against SPI1\nbecause SPI1 hospitals might have had less room for\nimprovement, and controls might have had higher\nthan average performance, particularly as half were\nalso selected as future SPI2 intervention sites. The\nstaff survey and explicit review, however, showed simi-\nlar performance at baseline, while adverse events and\nerror rates detected on holistic review were equivocal\n(favouring the control hospitals in one domain and the\nSPI1 hospitals in another).\nResults might have been biased in favour of SPI1\nbecause SPI1 sites were selected, not chosen at random\n(the reverse of the possible biasmentioned above), and\nagreement to participate in the evaluation could have\nhad a differentially motivating effect in SPI1 hospitals\nthan in control hospitals (a form of the Hawthorne\neffect that could not be avoided by randomisation).\nThese potential biases against controls would have\nbeen scientifically more worrisome had the results\nnot been mostly null.\nWe thank Michael D L Morgan, Martyn R Partridge, and Philip W Ind for\ntheir expertise and contribution in the development of the forms for the\nexplicit case note review; Janet Willars for conducting strategic\/senior\ninterviews and for helping to facilitate focus groups; Dale Webb, Louise\nThomas, and Simona Arena for their insight into the implementation of\nSPI; Peter Chilton for his assistance in the preparation of this manuscript;\nand Frank Davidoff, Peter Pronovost, Tim Hofer, and M Clare Derrington\nfor comments on the manuscript.\nContributors: AB, MD-W, JD, NB, and RL designed the study and\nsubmitted the grant proposal.
