INTRODUCTION\nThere is currently a great deal of interest in the deposi-\ntion of amorphous carbon films containing a sizable fraction\nof sp3 bonds. This so-called diamondlike carbon ~DLC! has\na number of technologically valuable features such as high\nhardness, low friction coefficient, chemical inertness, and\nlow electron affinity.1 It is now well established that tetrahe-\ndral sp3 bonding is promoted by deposition from medium\nenergy carbon ions.2 A highly tetrahedral form of amorphous\ncarbon, referred to as ta-C, containing up to 85% sp3 has\nbeen prepared using filtered beams of carbon ions. The fil-\ntering removes particulates and neutrals and provides a rela-\ntively monoenergetic beam of singly charged ion species.\nSeveral techniques such as mass selected ion beam\n~MSIB!,3,4 laser ablation of graphite,5\u20138 and filtered cathodic\nvacuum are ~FCVA!9\u201315 have been used to deposit ta-C.

The density, sp3 fraction, compres-\nsive stress, and resistivity were found to depend strongly on\nthe ion energy and pass through a maximum at ion energies\nranging from 50 to 240 eV.10 The present paper extends the\nwork in two directions. First, we describe the electronic and\noptical properties of FCVA deposited a-C as a function of\nthe ion energy and relate them to models of electronic\nstructure.16\u201319 We also report on the effect of deposition tem-\nperature on the structural characteristics of FCVA deposited\na-C films with particular reference to the optical and elec-\ntronic properties. Related studies have been carried out on\na-C prepared by other methods.15,20\u201322 A sharp transition\nfrom ta-C to sp2 bonded a-C was observed for films depos-\nited above the transition temperature while the variation in1399\/7\/$10.00 \u00a9 1997 American Institute of Physics\n\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloadthe electronic and optical properties was more gradual with\nthe deposition temperature. We place these results on the\nbulk electronic and optical properties in the context of\nchanges in carbon bonding structure within the films. Fur-\nthermore, the transition temperature was found to decrease\nwith ion energy. The transition is used to understand further\ndetails of the film growth mechanism known as\nsubplantation.3,4,23 In subplantation, incident ions with suffi-\ncient energy penetrate the atomic surface layer generating\nsp3 bonding. However, ions with excess energy migrate to\nthe surface decreasing the density to that of sp2 bonded car-\nbon.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe a-C films were deposited using a FCVA system\nwhere the carbon plasma is obtained from a graphite cathode\nof 99.999% purity. The arc is initiated by contacting the\ncathode with a retractable graphite anode of similar purity.\nThe carbon plasma is then transported around a 90\u00b0 curved\nmagnetic solenoid filter to remove neutrals and particulates\nalso generated by the arc.24 The solenoid, in our case, pro-\nduces an axial magnetic field of '25 mT which guides the\nelectrons around the bend creating an electrostatic potential\nwhich causes the ions to follow the same curve. Therefore,\nunlike the MSIB, the FCVA does not provide ion mass or\ncharge selection. A base pressure of 1025 Pa was achieved\nusing two diffusion pumps which rose to 1023 Pa during\ndeposition.\nThe a-C films were deposited on n-type ~001! silicon\nsubstrates clamped to a copper block. The incident energy of\nthe carbon ions was varied by applying a dc voltage to the\ncopper block. The total ion energy is therefore the sum of the\nincident ion energy and the applied voltage. The ion energy\nwas measured at the substrate position using a retarding field\nenergy analyzer with a Faraday cup.25 The temperature of the\nsubstrate was varied over 20\u2013500 \u00b0C by a heater attached to\nthe back of the copper block. Depositions below room tem-\nperature ~RT! were carried out by cryogenically cooling the\nsubstrate holder. The temperature was measured by a ther-\nmocouple attached behind the silicon substrate. For deposi-\ntions above RT, all samples were heated to 500 \u00b0C initially\nand cooled to the deposition temperature where they were\nheld for 10\u201315 min before initiating the plasma.\nThe stress in the films was derived by measuring the\nradius of curvature of the substrate before and after deposi-\ntion and applying Stoney\u2019s equation.26 Films for optical and\nelectronic measurements were deposited on quartz sub-\nstrates. The incident ion energy for this case was varied by\napplying rf voltage. The optical properties were determined\nfrom the reflectance and transmittance data using a double\nbeam spectrometer in the 200\u2013900 nm wavelength range.\nThe electrical conductivity of the films was measured by\nevaporating 5 mm30.5 mm Al electrode gap cells onto a-C.\nThe surface roughness was determined using atomic force\nmicroscopy ~AFM! where the area roughness Ra is defined\nas\nRa5S\nuZi2Zaveu\nN , ~1!140 J.

The films were prepared for EELS by dissolv-\ning the silicon substrate in a dilute HF1HNO3 solution and\nplacing the freed film onto copper support grids. The TEM\nwas operated at 100 kV and the EELS collection angle was\n10 mrad. The fraction of sp3 bonding was derived from the\ncarbon K edge, which consists of a peak at 285 eV due to\n1s\u2013p* transitions from the sp2 sites and a step at 289 eV\ndue to excitations into the s* states. The sp2 fraction is\ngiven by the ratio of the 285 eV peak to 289 eV step, nor-\nmalized to their ratio in graphitic carbon, which contains\n100% sp2 bonding. The microscopic density of each film can\nbe derived from the plasmon energy in the low energy EEL\nspectrum.10\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Ion beam characteristics\nThe 90\u00b0 magnetic solenoid filter guides the plasma\naround the bend, filters out the particulates and neutrals, and\nalso focuses the plasma. The ion energy distribution ~IED! of\nthe carbon plasma at the exit of the magnetic filter is shown\nin Fig. 1. The initial ion energy was found to be '21 eV and\ndid not vary significantly with the filter current. The high\ninitial ion energy is attributed to a \u2018\u2018potential hump\u2019\u2019 arising\nabove the cathode spot.27 The IED is clearly seen to be\nGaussian in shape and not Maxwellian as previously\nproposed.28 The full width at half-maximum ~FWHM! of the\nIED was found to be 7\u20139 eV. The large FWHM is attributed\nto multiply charged species which may be present in the\nplasma.28\nFIG. 1. Ion energy distribution ~IED! of the filtered plasma beam at a\nmagnetic field strength of 25 mT. The full width at half-maximum of the\ndistribution was found to be 7\u20139 eV. The ion energy did not vary signifi-\ncantly with the magnetic field strength.Chhowalla et al.\n\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloadB. Properties of films deposited at ambient\ntemperature\nThe optical absorption spectrum of ta-C deposited at am-\nbient temperature on quartz at an ion energy of 90 eV is\nillustrated in Fig. 2. The plot is a combination of data from\nreflection-transmission and photothermal deflection spectros-\ncopy ~PDS! measurements. The optical gap of an amorphous\nsemiconductor is conventionally defined as either the energy\n~E04! at which the absorption coefficient, a, 5104 cm21 or as\nthe Tauc gap, Eg , found by fitting a to: aE5B(E2Eg)2,\nwhere E is the photon energy (hn) and B is an empirical\nconstant. The variation of the sp3 fraction, E04 Tauc gap,\nrefractive index, and resistivity as a function of the ion en-\nergy at ambient temperature is shown in Fig. 3. The sp3\nfraction, optical gap, and refractive index are seen to reach a\nmaximum at an ion energy of '90 eV, indicating there is a\nstrong correlation among the properties. In Fig. 4, it can be\nseen that the optical gap of ta-C, although lower than for the\nhydrogenated films, varies in a similar fashion with the sp2\nfraction to other forms of a-C:H29,30 and ta-C:H,31 indicating\nthat the gap primarily depends on the sp2 sites and only\nweakly on the hydrogen content.\nThe dependence of the optical gap on the sp2 fraction\nmay be expected from the electronic structure of a-C since\nthe band gap is determined by the p states of the sp2 sites,16\nas these states lie closest to the Fermi level (EF). Therefore,\nthe fraction and arrangement of the sp2 sites are important in\ninfluencing the optical and electronic properties of the films.\nIt has been proposed16 that the sp2 sites pair up to form p\nbonds and segregate into clusters within the sp3 matrix. The\nformation of the clusters is opposed by disorder in the film.17\nIf the disorder is low, the width of the p band depends on the\ncluster size such that the optical gap varies inversely to the\ncluster size.18 However, it is now believed that any sp2 clus-\nters are relatively small,17 indicating the band gap depends\non both cluster size and local distortions of the p bonding\nand that no simple relationship for the band gap exists.\nFIG. 2. Absorption coefficient vs the photon energy. The plot is a combi-\nnation of measurements using photothermal deflection spectroscopy ~PDS!\nand an UV spectrometer.J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 81, No. 1, 1 January 1997\ned\u00ac01\u00acOct\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.158.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAIPThe gradual change in the band gap with the sp2 content\nin Fig. 4 suggests that the p bands become narrower and the\np\u2013p* gap widens as sp2 fraction decreases. The importance\nof p bonding is indicated by the steady increase in the Eg\neven when 20% sp2 sites remain in ta-C. The similar varia-\ntion of the gap in a-C:H and ta-C ~from Fig. 4! is particularly\nimportant at low sp2 contents where the sp2 sites are embed-\nded in a rigid matrix in ta-C but a rather floppy matrix in\npolymeric a-C:H. This suggests that the gap and the p bond-\ning of the sp2 sites depend primarily on the sp2 fraction and\nmuch less on the nature of the surrounding matrix or the\nhydrogen content, as originally thought.16\nFIG. 3. Graphs of ~a! sp3 fraction, ~b! Tauc, E04 optical band gaps, ~c!\nrefractive index, and ~d! resistivity vs the ion energy. All properties are\ncorrelated to each other. The optical gap and the resistivity values are seen\nto drop sharply at higher ion energies.\nFIG. 4. Optical band gap vs the sp2 fraction of ta-C and different types of\nhydrogenated a-C films for comparison. The gap is found to decrease lin-\nearly with the sp2 fraction.141Chhowalla et al.\n\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloadThe absorption edge for ta-C is ~from Fig. 2! observed to\nbe much broader than in other semiconductors such as\na-Si:H,32 indicating a high degree of disorder in the film.\nThe lower part of the absorption edge in Fig. 2 follows only\nan approximate exponential dependence required for the Ur-\nbach tail. Nevertheless, the Urbach slope, determined by\ndrawing a tangent to the log of the absorption coefficient at\na523103 cm21 in Fig. 2, is found to be 300 meV which\nsimilar to a-C:H1 and ta-C:H31 and compares to 55 meV for\na high quality a-Si:H.32\nThe variation of the resistivity as a function of the ion\nenergy at RT is plotted in Fig. 3~d!. The sharp decrease in\nresistivity at higher ion energies is attributed to increase in\ndisorder in the film due to energetic ion bombardment lead-\ning to a higher number of gap states. The electronic conduc-\ntivity of ta-C as a function of inverse temperature is shown\nin Fig. 5. It should be noted that ta-C differs from hydroge-\nnated a-C in which the Arrhenius plot is curved.33 The acti-\nvation energy (DE) from Fig. 5 was found to be '0.45 eV,\nmuch less than half the band gap ~2.3 eV!, indicating the\nFermi level lies away from the midgap. Measurements on\nta-C\/Si heterojunctions, nitrogen doping data, and recently\nfabricated thin film transistors suggest Ef lies below midgap\nand that undoped ta-C is p type.34\u201336 Furthermore, electronic\ncalculations suggest E f is pinned below the midgap by defect\nsites.\nThe singly occupied defect states at E f give rise to an\nelectronic spin resonance ~ESR! signal. The defect density in\nta-C as a function of the ion energy has been found to be\nvery high,37 approaching that of unhydrogenated a-Si. The\nspin density in principle is controlled by two factors, disor-\nder and bonding. The large defect density observed in ta-C\npresumably arises due to ion induced disorder from the depo-\nsition process. However, this is countered by the energy gain\nin p bonding which, according to calculations,18 tends to\nreduce the defect densities at high sp3 contents.\nThe ESR signal linewidth as a function of the sp2 frac-\ntion is shown in Fig. 6. It is presently unclear if the defects in\nta-C arise from single sp2 sites or clusters. Information on\nthe structure and chemistry for most materials can be derived\nfrom the ESR g factor, but this is less helpful in the case of\nta-C because most defects lie at g52.0028, similar to all\nFIG. 5. Plot of conductivity vs the temperature. Note the trend is a straight\nline, in contrast to hydrogenated a-C which is curved.142 J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 81, No. 1, 1 January 1997\ned\u00ac01\u00acOct\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.158.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAIPother forms of carbon. Therefore the linewidth is the main\nsource of information in ta-C. The linewidth can be attrib-\nuted to disorder, dipolar broadening, exchange narrowing, or\nthe presence of numerous subsidiary lines. Unlike a-Si:H,\nwhere the ESR line of dangling bonds is Gaussian due to the\ndominance of disorder broadening,32 the ta-C line is a\nLorentzian, eliminating disorder broadening as a factor.\nAlso, the linewidth in ta-C was found not to vary with the\nmicrowave excitation frequency indicating the signal con-\nsists of a single line.38 Additionally, dipolar broadening\narises from interaction with hydrogen nuclei. Therefore, the\nabsence of hydrogen makes the ESR data in ta-C very infor-\nmative. The linewidth of ta-C in Fig. 6 is seen to vary in a\nsimilar fashion to other forms of a-C:H containing H, thus\nthe linewidth is not due to dipolar broadening by H. There-\nfore, the linewidth is primarily attributed to exchange nar-\nrowing, also suggested by others.39,40 The linewidth will then\nvary linearly with the localization of unpaired electron or\ninversely with the \u2018\u2018cluster\u2019\u2019 size over which it is delocal-\nized, accounting for the decrease in linewidth with the sp2\nfraction for all a-C~:H! seen in Fig. 6.\nC. Variation with deposition temperature\nThe variation of the sp3 fraction, plasmon energy com-\npressive stress, and surface roughness as a function of the\nsubstrate temperature (Ts) for 90 and 130 eV ions is shown\nin Fig. 7. Each property is found to be independent of Ts\ninitially but falls sharply at a transition temperature ~T1! of\n'200 and 140 \u00b0C for ion energies of 90 and 130 eV, respec-\ntively. Films appear to undergo a transition from ta-C to\nessentially sp2 bonded a-C above T1 .\nA similar trend was previously observed for ta-C depos-\nited by MSIB,20,21 laser initiated pulsed arc system15 and also\nfor ta-C:H deposited using a plasma beam source.22 The T1\n~'140 \u00b0C! in the 130 eV case is equivalent to that observed\nfor the MSIB system20,21 but much lower than that observed\nfor ta-C:H.22 A similar decrease in the transition temperature\nwith ion energy was found for ta-C:H while MSIB deposited\nfilms show an opposite trend. The reason for this discrepancy\nis presently unclear.\nAll films exhibited extremely smooth surfaces ~Ra'0.2\nnm! making them useful for high performance tribological\napplications. The roughness was found to remain constant\nFIG. 6. Linewidth of the ESR signal vs the sp3 fraction. Note the unhydro-\ngenated a-C follows a similar trend to its hydrogenated counterparts.Chhowalla et al.\n\u00aclicense\u00acor\u00accopyright;\u00acsee\u00achttp:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\nDownloadwith the deposition temperature, in contrast to the films de-\nposited using MSIB.20,21 The increase in surface roughness\nwith Ts in MSIB is attributed to the diffusion of shallowly\nimplanted ~subplanted! species to the surface. However,\nsince the deposition rates are significantly higher in the\nFCVA case, we infer that the arrival rate of an ion is of the\norder of the diffusion rate.\nThe deposition rate was found to sharply increase at T1 ,\nwhich is correlated to the drop in the plasmon energy ~film\ndensity! with Ts . We attribute the increase in growth rate to\nthe predominance of the low density sp2 phase above T1\nleading to an increase in film thickness. The a-C films de-\nposited above T1 were also examined using a TEM and were\nfound to possess the ~0002! interlayer diffraction peak char-\nacteristic of microcrystalline graphite suggesting that a phase\ntransition has occurred. However, the phase transition cannot\nbe regarded in classical thermodynamic terms since it is not\nreversible. Furthermore, the presence of microcrystalline\ngraphite suggests the film has somehow experienced very\nhigh local temperature during deposition.\nThe variation of optical gap, refractive index, activation\nenergy, and resistivity with Ts of films deposited on quartz is\nplotted in Fig. 8. The properties are well correlated to each\nother and decline gradually with Ts , in contrast to the\nsharper drop in sp3 fraction, compressive stress, and plas-\nmon energy. The possibility that the contrasting trends could\narise from the difference in the thermal conductivity of\nquartz and silicon was checked by measuring the refractive\nindex of the films on silicon by ellipsometry. The trend was\nFIG. 7. Graphs of ~a! sp3 fraction, ~b! plasmon energy, ~c! compressive\nstress, and ~d! surface roughness as a function of the substrate temperature at\ntwo ion energies. The sharp decrease in the properties correlates to a tran-\nsition from ta-C to a-C. The transition temperature for the higher energy\nfilm is seen to decrease from '200 to 140 \u00b0C. Note the film roughness does\nnot change with deposition temperature, in contrast to films deposited using\nMSIB ~Ref. 37!.J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 81, No. 1, 1 January 1997\ned\u00ac01\u00acOct\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.158.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAIPfound to be similar to the optical gap as seen in Fig. 8~b!,\nsuggesting that the difference in variation between the sp3\nfraction and the optical and electronic properties is real. The\ngap and resistivity are observed to continue rising with de-\ncreasing Ts below room temperature. The gradual change in\nthe optical and electrical properties well below T1 suggests\nthat although the sp2 content is low in the most diamondlike\nfilms, the optical and electronic properties are nevertheless\ncontrolled by the residual sp2 fraction. Therefore, there is no\n\u2018\u2018critical\u2019\u2019 sp2 fraction at which sudden changes in the opti-\ncal and electronic properties occur. Furthermore, the fall of\nthe gap and resistivity with increasing temperature below T1\nsuggests that the sp2 sites begin to show increasing order\nwell below the transition temperature.\nThe resistivity and conductivity activation energy (DE)\nalso fall gradually with increasing substrate temperature as\nshown in Figs. 8~c! and 8~d!, consistent with the change in\nthe band gap. Again, the resistivity is seen to increase further\nfor deposition below room temperature. The DE is observed\nto be less than half the optical gap because E f lies below\nmidgap, as previously noted.\nIV. DEPOSITION MECHANISM\nThe formation of ta-C is generally described by the sub-\nplantation model3,4,10,23,41 which is based on incident ener-\ngetic ions penetrating the surface and providing subsurface\ngrowth. The decline in density at higher ion energies is at-\ntributed to implanted ions diffusing back to the surface, ei-\nther by thermally activated diffusion during a thermal spike\nstage of thermal dissipation after the cascade23,42 or due to\ndefect formation by radiation damage during cascade.3,4,43\nThe concept of thermal spike is contentious but has been\nFIG. 8.

Below, we offer a preliminary description\nwhich shows that the effect of deposition temperature may\nbe significant in the later stages of the thermal spike. Using\nthe thermal spike model of relaxation, the incremental in-\ncrease in density can be expressed as:\nDr\nr\n5\nf\n12 f1b , ~2!\nwhere f is the ion penetration probability and b is the num-\nber of atomic hops per incident ion. Most analytic models\nassume that the thermal spike starts as a delta function at a\nsingle site with an effective temperature equivalent to the ion\nenergy, and that the energy is dissipated by thermal\ndiffusion.42 The temperature distribution in a thermal spike\nfrom an ion of energy E at position r after time t is\nT~r ,t !5\nE\nc~4pDt !3\/2 expS 2 r4Dt2D , ~3!\nwhere c is the thermal capacity and D the thermal diffusiv-\nity. The increase in temperature causes thermally activated\ndiffusion so that the total number of atomic hops in one spike\nis given by\nb5E\nr1\n`\n4pr2drE\nt1\n`\nn0n0 expS 2 E0kT~ t ,r ! D dt , ~4!\nwhere n0 is the atomic density defined as ~ 43pa3!21, n0 the\nphonon frequency, and E0 the activation energy for atomic\ndiffusion. It is convenient to express Eq. ~4! in atomic units\nby taking the heat capacity to be 3k , so c59k\/4pa3 and\nD5n0a2. Expressing r85r\/a , t85t\/n0 , then integrating\nover t8 and using the reduced temperature, t5kT\/E0 , gives\nb5E\nt1\nt2\nt28\/3 expS 2 1t D dt ~5!\nso the total number of hops within the limits t1!0 and\nt2!` is\nb50.016pS EE0D\n5\/3\n, ~6!\nwhere p is a material parameter of order 1. This is the b\nvalue used in Eq. ~2! thus far. The main contribution to b can\nbe found from\ndb\ndt 5t\n28\/3 expS 2 1t D . ~7!\nEquation ~7! is plotted in Fig. 9 which shows that the major-\nity of the hops occur when the reduced temperature at the\nspike center is t' 38, or about 104 K for E053 eV, not at the\nvery high temperature in the initial stages of a spike. There-\nfore, the deposition temperature will be significant when it is\na substantial part of E0 rather than of E . Indeed, some recent\nmolecular dynamic simulations suggest that the spike starts\nwith a finite size and relatively low temperature.44\u201347 Thus,144 J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 81, No. 1, 1 January 1997\ned\u00ac01\u00acOct\u00ac2010\u00acto\u00ac131.227.178.158.\u00acRedistribution\u00acsubject\u00acto\u00acAIPthe deposition temperature is now a significant fraction of the\nspike temperature, explaining, at least qualitatively, why the\nlow substrate temperature affects the relaxation rate. Al-\nthough Eq. ~4! does not give a quantitative description of the\ntemperature dependence, it does account for the decrease in\nT1 with ion energy. A decrease in T1 with ion energy is\nconsistent with thermally activated process during a thermal\nspike, with higher energies leading to further relaxation.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe variation of the optical band gap and electronic\nproperties of carbon films deposited using a FCVA was stud-\nied as a function of the ion energy. The optical gap is corre-\nlated to the sp3 fraction, reaching a maximum of 2.3 eV at\n85%, and varies linearly with the sp2 fraction. The bulk elec-\ntronic and optical properties of ta-C are shown to be con-\ntrolled by the residual sp2 fraction, even when the sp3 \u2018\u2018dia-\nmondlike\u2019\u2019 content is as high as 85%. Furthermore, the\nobserved decrease in ESR linewidth with increasing ion en-\nergy is consistent with an increase is sp2 cluster size over\nwhich defect states are localized. The effect of deposition\ntemperature on film properties at two ion energies was also\nreported. The properties were found to sharply change with\nsubstrate temperature. The temperature at which the transi-\ntion from ta-C to a-C occurs is '200 \u00b0C for 90 eV ions\nwhich decreased to '140 \u00b0C when the ion energy was in-\ncreased to 130 eV. The electronic and optical properties\nhowever do not show any sharp transition, which is consis-\ntent with these properties always being controlled by the sp2\nbonded carbon component. The gradual change in the elec-\ntronic properties with Ts suggests that ordering of the sp2\nsites starts to occur well below the transition temperature.\nThe transition of ta-C to a-C with deposition temperature is\nattributed to the diffusion of subplanted atoms to the surface\nvia activated thermal diffusion, leading to the relaxation of\nstress and quenched-in density increase. A preliminary de-\nscription of the temperature dependence is offered in context\nof the subplantation model, however a detailed model is\nlacking.\nFIG. 9.
