However, the concept of wellbeing remains ill-defined, an instability that is \nincreasingly understood as problematic to policy-making. The paper engages with this \nterminological instability through an exploration of how the concept of wellbeing is practised \ndiscursively in local governance and critically examines the place of the concept in local policy-\nmaking.  In contrast to the current enthusiasm to define and measure wellbeing, we argue that the \nconceptual instability has inherent value for local governance. The concept of wellbeing is \npractised through a number of potentially conflicting discourses, but it is exactly this conceptual \ninstability that enables a local negotiation and combination of alternative policy frameworks for \nlocal place-shaping strategies. As such, wellbeing is not only an overarching goal of governance \nbut also contributes to the dynamics of the policy process. \n \n \n  \n 4 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nIn the last twenty years, high income countries have witnessed an important movement in the \naspirations of public policy beyond meeting merely material goals towards a range of outcomes \ncaptured through the use of the term wellbeing. In the United Kingdom, the concept of wellbeing \nis prominent as a goal of contemporary policy making:  \u201eIn order to get a better understanding \nand focus on wellbeing.... the government will sponsor cross-disciplinary work....to explore how \npolicies might change with an explicit wellbeing focus\u201f  (HM Government, 2005: 23). The 2000 \nLocal Government Act obliges local government \u201eto set the overall strategic direction and long-\nterm vision for the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of a local area\u201f (DCLG, 2008a: \n26).  But the concept of wellbeing is itself ill-defined, a term used in multiple different contexts \nwith different meanings and policy implications. This instability of meaning and the associated \nlack of shared understanding have been positioned as risks or barriers to communication and \npartnership in policy and governance (Ereaut and Whiting, 2008). There are currently major \nmoves to define and measure wellbeing.  The recent high profile Commission on the \nMeasurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress was set up to explore relevant \nindicators of social progress beyond GDP and includes wellbeing as a key outcome (Stiglitz et \nal., 2009). Developing societal measures of wellbeing is an analytical priority for the UK Office \nof National Statistics (Allin, 2007). This paper challenges this presumed need for precision in \ndefinition and measurement of wellbeing. First, we introduce the dominant use of the concept of \nwellbeing as evident in academic studies and position this into Rose\u201fs theory of contemporary \ngovernance (1996).  We then explore how the concept of wellbeing is practised discursively in \nlocal governance to critically examine the presumed place of wellbeing an overarching goal in \nlocal policy-making.  \n \nAcademic knowledge and expertise contribute to framing and legitimating the practices of central \nconcepts of governance such as wellbeing and there is a substantial and growing body of work \n 5 \n \nexploring the nature and definition of wellbeing.  Within this, a mainstream approach has \nemerged to operationalise wellbeing. First, research mostly takes a normative approach to \ndefinition and deals with the abstract nature of the concept by breaking it down into constitutive \ncomponents (see for example Stiglitz et al., 2009). Debates concern the identification of \nindependent dimensions and the relative value of objective and subjective elements (Deneulin \nand McGregor, 2009; Diener et al., 2009; Fleuret and Atkinson, 2007; Nussbaum, 2000).  \nSecondly, these philosophical elaborations of the dimensions to wellbeing underpin applied, \nquantitative research on assessment and measurement and on the identification of associated \nvariables (Clarke et al., 2006; Huppert et al., 2005; McGillivray and Clarke, 2006; Searle, 2008; \nSteuer and Marks, 2008). These endeavours share a common understanding of wellbeing as a \nquality that inheres to the individual. Wellbeing may be influenced by factors and processes from \nthe individual to the global in scale and reach; it may be an objective characteristic or a subjective \nassessment; it may refer to a current state or a projection into the future, but the concept of \nwellbeing itself is individual in scale.  \n \nThis treatment of wellbeing as an individual attribute has not always been the case. Sointu (2005) \ndocuments the changing dominance of different competing definitions of wellbeing since 1985 in \nthe UK press. She identifies a clear shift in the term from a collective attribute, mostly associated \nwith economic wellbeing, through to an individual attribute, largely related to a positive mental \nstate. Sointu (2005) interprets this shift in the dominant use of the term wellbeing as concurrent \nwith changes to the modes of governance and welfare provision grouped under the label of \nneoliberalism. There is almost no analysis to-date that explores how wellbeing is conceptualised \nin relation to different governance regimes.  Dean builds a conceptual analysis of \u201emoral and \npolitical accounts \u2013 through which people in different social and cultural contexts might \nunderstand and contend with ... threats to well-being\u201f (Dean, 2003: 2). He maps such potential \ndiscursive repertoires of wellbeing along two dimensions: first, a universal-local dimension \n 6 \n \nwhich differentiates the systems and structures through which social, economic and political \nresources are coordinated from a local agency through which meanings, behaviour and feelings \nare constructed; secondly, a contractarian-solidaristic dimension of traditions of citizenship and \npolicy which differentiates subjects as bargaining and competitive from subjects as attached or \ncooperative. Contemporary neoliberal governance maps high on the universal and contractarian \ndimensional poles.  \n \nDean\u201fs conceptual framework centres on discourses. This reflects arguments that much of \ngoverning is about defining the situation through the discursive construction of frameworks \nwithin which problems and policy responses are defined and negotiated (Hajer and Laws, 2006). \nWithin a neoliberal discursive repertoire, the individual is reassigned as the primary unit of action \nand analysis, as the arbiter of policy options through consumer choice and the site for self-\nmanagement and self-actualisation (Barnett, 2003; Harvey, 2005). Herein lies the connection that \nSointu (2005) asserts between neoliberalism and wellbeing. Wellbeing, treated as an individual \nquality, is ultimately the outcome of individual choices and actions for both self and closely \nconnected others. Writers drawing on Foucault\u201fs notion of governmentality (1991) examine how \nthis apparent space for self-actualisation is one in which choice is shaped and directed through a \ncomplex interplay of multiple rationalities and technologies (Binkley, 2007; MacKinnon, 2000; \nMiller and Rose, 2008; Prince et al., 2006; Rose et al., 2006). Local government is thus tasked to \nenable social inclusion through an active, responsibilised engagement in their own wellbeing \n(Barnett, 2003). Systems of audit and accounting, monitoring and surveillance are central to a \nneoliberal governance regime, in which standardised indicators and performance targets for local \ngovernment may effectively shape both goals and visions of local government (Miller and Rose, \n2008; Rydin, 2007).  Through a governmentality lens, wellbeing holds promise as both discursive \nrationality and calculative technology by which to promote and valorise self-actualisation and \nself-responsibilisation as part of a competent citizenry. The concept can enable everyday \n 7 \n \nindividual behaviours to be connected into wider rationalities of government through, on the one \nhand, a moral imperative for self-management and, on the other, the external definition of \nresponsible choices. However, realising this promise is still an emergent process. The imperative \nfor better measurement of wellbeing and the dominant uses of the term in both academia and the \nmass press can be seen as reflecting this process. To what extent, then, is this process evident in \nthe mobilisation of the concept of wellbeing in local governance in the UK?   \n \nNATIONAL STRUCTURING OF WELLBEING \nCentral government in the UK positions wellbeing prominently in policy goals across various \nsectors, including children, health and sustainable development. The Local Government Act, \n2000, makes wellbeing key to the obligation of local government to elaborate a local Sustainable \nCommunity Strategy (DCLG, 2008b). Local government is situated as a place-shaping agency \ninformed and guided by the Local Strategic Partnership, a non-statutory forum for voluntary \ninvolvement of local communities in local governance (DCLG, 2006). The sustainable \ncommunity strategy is operationalised and monitored through the local area agreement which \ncomprises a series of targets and monitoring tools to evaluate and assess progress (DCLG, \n2008b).  Local authority targets are developed within The National Performance Framework \ndesigned to assess performance and legislated through the Local Government and Public \nInvolvement in Health Act, 2007.  This provides a national set of 198 standardised indicators \nfrom which each local authority selects 35 in agreement with central government plus 17 \nstatutory targets on early years and educational progress (DCLG, 2007).  \n \nA governmentality approach expects the requirement for conceptual goals to be translatable into \ndefined and measurable objects to in turn structure vision so as to constrain local priority \ndefinition by specifying a set of standardised, universal measures (Enticott and Entwistle, 2007; \nRydin, 2007). However, empirical studies of local governance demonstrate resistance to, or at \n 8 \n \nleast reconstruction of, the influence of both the discursive rationalities and such calculative \ntechnologies. Some local government officers will have trained within or have political \nsympathies with alternative discursive repertoire of governance, particularly those that map onto \nDean\u201fs poles of local and solidaristic (2003). Moreover, various policy issues and concepts are \ncharacterised by overt contestation which make resistance and reconstruction more likely (Rydin, \n2007).  Operationalising wellbeing constitutes such a policy issue, recognised as a challenge to \ndefine and measure (Allin, 2007; HM Government, 2005; ONS web-site).  \n \nThe influence of an imperative for measurement on conceptual definition is evident in examining \nhow wellbeing is structured at national level. The 2006 Government White Paper, \u201eStrong and \nprosperous communities\u201f outlines national government\u201fs priority challenges (see Table 1). \nDespite the broad usage of the concept of wellbeing in central government directives for \nSustainable Community Strategies (DCLG, 2008a), sustainable development goals (HM \nGovernment, 2005) and national priorities for measurement and monitoring (Allin, 2007), here \nthe term wellbeing is practised only within two of the national challenges: \u201eHealth and Well-\nbeing\u2019 where it is frequently used throughout the section [p13]; \u2018Children, Young People and \nFamilies\u2019, where it reiterates one of the goals of the government\u201fs Every Child Matters policy - \n\u201eachieving economic well being\u201f [p31].  The National Performance Framework (DCLG, 2007) \npresents the national indicator set by themes (see Table 1), and similarly places wellbeing in \nrelation to health, this time adult health, and the Every Child Matters goal of economic wellbeing.  \nThe national strategy and the related set of performance indicators thus resolve tensions between \nconcept and indicator by structuring the concept of wellbeing into two distinct and contained \nfields.  \n \nANALYSING LOCAL SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES \n 9 \n \nThe paper takes as its case material the Sustainable Community Strategies.  Given local \ngovernment is tasked with enabling self-responsibilisation and self-actualisation, the term \nwellbeing may be mobilised to this end.  But given the contestation around the definition of \nwellbeing, the term may also afford a conceptual tool for resistance at local level to neoliberal \ndiscursive regimes. We explore how wellbeing is practiced at two levels within the strategy \ndocuments: first, the way local authorities frame their vision and priority themes, which we have \ncalled the structuring of wellbeing; secondly, the discursive practices of the term wellbeing and \nthe implicit constellations of themes and meanings.  \n \nIn selecting a small number of case study documents, we set two criteria: we excluded large local \nauthorities likely to be more powerful in their dealings with central government; we wanted the \nlocal authorities to share regional concerns and regionally defined priorities to better compare \nlocally determined practices. Thus, the study selected the Sustainable Community Strategies from \nthree relatively small urban boroughs within the Tees Valley region in the Northeast of England:  \nDarlington, Hartlepool and Stockton which are adjacent along the north shore of the River Tees. \nThe three sustainable community strategies were all published towards the end of 2008, together \nwith the Local Area Agreements (Darlington Partnership, 2008; Hartlepool Partnership, 2008; \nStockton Renaissance, 2008). The documents are complemented by interviews with two key local \ngovernment officers in each borough, purposively selected as key in the production and \nsubsequent management of the documents.  Semi-structured interviews were undertaken between \nJune 2008 and March 2009 on a one-to-one basis and lasted around an hour.  All interviews were \nrecorded and transcribed before analysis. In line with assurances of confidentiality, informants \nare not identified by local authority when quoted. \n \nThe analysis proceeds in three stages. First, the local structures of wellbeing, that is how \nwellbeing is placed within the overall visions and priority themes of the local strategies, are \n 10 \n \ndescribed and compared with the national structures. Secondly, the discursive practices of \nwellbeing are mapped by the themes associated with the practice of the term and against a set of \ndimensions adapted from Ereaut and Whiting (2008), listed in Table 2. Thirdly, local agency is \nexplored through the meanings given to wellbeing by the key local government officers \ninterviewed. The final section draws on this three-step analysis to reflect on the place of \nwellbeing in local government policy-making.  \n \n1. LOCAL STRUCTURES OF WELLBEING \nThe Darlington and Hartlepool strategies are structured round a vision to improve lives and \nplaces and whilst wellbeing is not explicitly used, both emphasise opportunities for everyone to \nrealise their potential. In Darlington the key concepts are inclusion, a Darlington whose benefits \nare for all people, and place, which has various aspects including environmental concerns. The \neconomy is not positioned as an aim in itself, but as a means to the people and place related \ngoals: \n\u201e...we want to make the most of our potential for greater prosperity, and open up aspiration \nand opportunity for everybody.\u201f  [Darlington, SCS: 7] \nHartlepool\u201fs vision is expressed through a list of desirable qualities for Hartlepool, itself defined \nas community and physical environment. These community and environmental qualities will \nenable social inclusion and benefits for all. \n\u201eHartlepool will be an ambitious, healthy, respectful, inclusive, thriving and outward-looking \ncommunity, in an attractive and safe environment, where everyone is able to realise their \npotential.\u201f [Hartlepool, SCS: 5] \nBy contrast, the Stockton vision echoes the wellbeing domains in the Local Government Act, \n2000, being structured by economic, environmental and social goals:  \n \u201eStockton-on-Tees driving Economic Renaissance..... \nAn enhanced quality of place.... \n 11 \n \nEnhanced well-being and achievement for local people\u201f [Stockton SCS: 9] \nThe economy is placed at the forefront of the vision as an end in itself, with environmental and \nsocial ends taking an equal, parallel and intersecting role. Only Stockton uses the word wellbeing \nin the vision statement and by placing it into the social strand, explicitly relates the concept to \npeople and individuals. \n \nThe visions are developed through sets of themes which reflect closely, but not exactly, the \nindicative themes of national government (see Table 1). All documents identify a theme related to \nthe economy, although this varies as to what is included beyond commerce and jobs. They all \nalso contain themes related to the safety of communities, health and the environment. Hartlepool \nand Stockton echo the national theme of stronger communities. Children and young people are \nhigh profile in all documents but there is variation in how this category is placed. Stockton alone \nspecifically identifies demographic groups, children and young people, older adults, echoing the \nnational performance framework. The other documents use categories of aspiration and lifelong \nlearning for the whole population, but within which children and young people are given a \nparticular focus. Hartlepool and Stockton expressly diverge from the national themes by placing \nleisure and the arts amongst their themes; these are embedded within other themes in the \nDarlington document. The national government\u201fs theme of tackling exclusion and promoting \nequality has been incorporated into both vision and themes in all local authority strategies but not \npositioned as a separate category.    \n \nThus, whilst the national themes are mostly echoed through all the local sustainable community \nstrategies, there are important variations both from the national structure and between the \nadjacent local authorities in the framing and language of challenges.  \n \n2. MAPPING THE DISCURSIVE PRACTICES OF WELLBEING \n 12 \n \n2.1 Themes of wellbeing \nThe term wellbeing is used with least in Stockton where practice almost exclusively relates to \nindividual health: \n\u201eOur vision is for a healthier Stockton where all residents are able to take control of their \nown physical and mental health and well-being..\u201f  [Stockton, SCS: 35]. \nThe few occurrences in which wellbeing does not refer to health, relate to children together with \na connection between wellbeing and achievement, which can be traced through different \ndemographic groups: \u201ewellbeing and achievement for adults and communities\u201f and \u201ewellbeing \nand achievement for children\u201f.  \n \nSimilarly, in Hartlepool, the term wellbeing most often relates to mental and physical wellbeing \nand, again, the exceptions relate to children. However, since Hartlepool\u201fs agenda for children and \nyoung people cuts across its eight themes, wellbeing is placed and practised not only under the \ntheme, \u201ehealth and wellbeing\u201f, but also under the themes of \u201ejobs and the economy\u201f in relation to \nthe Every Child Matters goal of promoting economic wellbeing (p.31) and of community safety:  \n\u201e...where ...all adults take responsibility for their [children\u201fs] safety and wellbeing\u201f \n[Hartlepool, SCS: 46] \nAdult wellbeing also features under the jobs and the economy theme in an argument that: \n\u201e...residents enjoying better physical and mental wellbeing as a result of being in \nemployment\u201f [Hartlepool, SCS: 33]   \n \nThe Darlington document expresses the most varied practice of the term wellbeing. Moreover, \nthe expression beyond health does not exclusively relate to children. The term wellbeing is placed \nunder three of the five themes, healthier, aspiring and greener Darlington. The practice of the \nterm wellbeing under the healthier theme contrasts the other documents in talking of fulfillment, \nas opposed to achievement:  \n 13 \n \n\u201e\u2026happiness, fulfillment and well-being are central to the vision\u201f [Darlington, SCS: 30] \nThe concept of emotional wellbeing is firmly embedded within a wide range of processes:  \n \u201e\u2026enable people to be in control of their lives, have equality of opportunity and \naspiration, have access to the information and support they need to pursue their \naspirations, to value their place in the community, and to treat one another with respect \nand dignity \u2013 these objectives underpin emotional health and well-being\u201f [Darlington, \nSCS: 30] \nDarlington is also distinctive in an explicit reference to spiritual aspects of wellbeing,:  \n\u201e\u2026broader view of prosperity and aspiration as embracing spiritual and mental well-being \nand the \u201esocial capital\u201f of community involvement, as well as material wealth\u201f \n[Darlington, SCS: 17] \nWellbeing is linked to community concerns of social relations, pleasant spaces and equity: \nSupporting informal leisure and health and well-being by reclaiming open space for \ncommunity use..\u201f  [Darlington, SCS: 35] \n \u201eA philosophical forum for debate on issues of inclusion, equality and community well-\nbeing\u201f [Darlington, SCS: 41] \n \n2.2 Conceptual dimensions of wellbeing \nThe detailed meanings implicit in the discursive practices of the term are mapped onto a number \nof conceptual dimensions, listed in Table 2.  \n \nFirst, despite the dominance in current research of wellbeing as an individual attribute, several \nuses of the term reflect either collective or non-human scales, particularly in the Darlington \nstrategy: \n 14 \n \n \u201e\u2026our focus on improvement, and particularly on tackling deprivation, should be \nmatched by care for the wellbeing of the whole community and the environment\u201f \n[Darlington SCS: 11]  \n\u201e\u2026building the social inclusion and environmental well-being that are the desired \ncharacteristics of a sustainable community\u201f [Darlington SCS: 5] \nHowever, the meaning of this collective use is uncertain. A connection to a notion of \nsustainability is implicit, as are attributes of inclusion, respect and care.  \n \nSecondly, the majority of uses of the term wellbeing were in contexts where some form of \nobjective assessment of that wellbeing could be made by someone else,  \n\u201eWe will give priority to: improving sexual health, including a reduction in teenage \nconception rates; reducing levels of substance misuse; improving emotional and mental \nwell-being including tackling bullying; halting the rise in obesity; and maintaining low \nrates of infant mortality\u201f [Stockton SCS: 33] \nOnly a few cases indicated that people themselves might constitute the primary source of \nassessment:  an unusual combination with spiritual wellbeing in Darlington; references to \nhappiness or fulfilment, also mostly in Darlington. By contrast, Hartlepool and Stockton eschew a \nsubjective fulfilment in favour of \u201eachievement\u201f as amenable to objective measurement given its \ncommon association with children, education and skills. However, the Stockton document does \nposition perceptions of the local environment as a key influence on wellbeing \u2013 possibly a \ndimension to wellbeing, possibly a factor affecting wellbeing, but certainly something to be \nassessed subjectively.  \n \nThirdly, wellbeing was most often placed as an end in itself and never only as a means to another \nend,  \n 15 \n \n\u201eResidents enjoying better physical and mental wellbeing as a result of being in \nemployment\u2026\u201f [Hartlepool SCS: 33] \n\u201eRecognising and accommodating the broader view of prosperity and aspiration as \nembracing spiritual and mental well-being and the \u201esocial capital\u201f of community \ninvolvement, as well as material wealth\u2026\u201f [Darlington SCS: 17]  \nThus community wellbeing is valued for its own sake as well as for the wellbeing of the \nindividuals comprising it. Economic wellbeing is positioned as the means for better future \nwellbeing, in other senses, for children and adults; environmental wellbeing is positioned both as \nan important end in itself and as part of sustainable living.  \n \nFourthly, despite claims that wellbeing captures a holistic experience of living, the multiple \ndimensions comprising wellbeing are treated as different spheres of action, spheres which are \nboth distinguishable components of wellbeing and distinguishable influences on wellbeing. This \nblurring enables a reduction of wellbeing to these components for monitoring and policy \nevaluation:  \n\u201cIndividuals need to be able to develop their own integrated package to improve their \nwell-being, including for example: employment opportunities; health improvement; social \ncare; education and lifelong learning; leisure and cultural activities\u201d [Stockton SCS: 44]  \n \nFifthly, this components approach and the need to measure wellbeing results in the concept \nlargely treated as a static state,  \n\u201eimproving emotional and mental well-being including tackling bullying; halting the rise \nin obesity; and maintaining low rates of infant mortality.... looked after children will have \nthe similar levels of physical and mental health....\u201f [Stockton, SCS: 33] \nalthough implicit reference to the life-course emerges occasionally,   \n 16 \n \n\u201egood health and well-being for older people, rooted in healthy lifestyle choices earlier in \nlife\u201f [Darlington, SCS: 30] \n\u201eEnhancing well-being and achievement of children and adults will ensure...life \nopportunities for all our residents...\u201f [Stockton, SCS: 9] \n \nSixthly, there is confusion whether wellbeing is more than a neutral state. Wellbeing is often used \nrather rhetorically as a positive emotional state, but reverts in the detail to a biomedical absence \nof mental ill-health,  \n\u201c...to promote mental wellbeing, to reduce suicide rates and support people with mental \nhealth problems\u201d.  [Hartlepool, SCS: 42] \nThis reduction to an absence of ill-health in part reflects the imperative to describe and monitor \nthe pursuit of wellbeing through measurable indicators. However, positive meanings to the term \nare evident in other contexts,  \n\u201e...to support individuals to enjoy their lives and achieve wholeness and mental well-\nbeing\u201f [Darlington, SCS: 12] \n\u201eTo improve the health, emotional development and wellbeing of all children, young \npeople and their families... \u201e [Hartlepool, SCS: 65] \n \nLastly, the documents combine different levels of responsibility. The local authority reasserts its \ntraditional responsibilities for the provision of services but expands this with a brief for \nimproving the context in which others can make responsible choices. Nonetheless, children are \nbrought almost entirely under the ambit of national and local government, \n\u201eWe will promote the health, wellbeing and achievement of children and young people\u201f \n[Stockton SCS: 12] \nThe emphasis on individual responsibilities, especially for health and healthy lifestyles, is evident \nthroughout:   \n 17 \n \n\u201e\u2026where all residents are able to take control of their own physical and mental health and \nwellbeing, through living healthy and active lifestyles..\u201f [Stockton SCS: 36] \nMore interesting is the positioning of the community as taking responsibility for subjective \naspects of wellbeing,   \n\u201eRegarding the happiness, fulfillment and well-being of individuals as a legitimate \nconcern for the community as a whole..\u201f  [Darlington SCS: 12] \n \nThis exercise in mapping the place and practice of the term wellbeing within the Sustainable \nCommunity Strategies indicates three concurrent discourses. The most frequent use of the term \nthrough all three documents relates to health and wellbeing, constructed as: individual in scale; \ndefined objectively by others; a state with component elements, although reference to the life-\ncourse is noted; expressing ambivalence as to whether wellbeing is a neutral state characterised \nby the absence of definable features of ill-health or a positive state characterised by what remain \nill-defined criteria; strongly defined as ultimately the responsibility of the self. This practice is so \nubiquitous it clearly constitutes the contemporary dominant discourse for wellbeing.  In \nHartlepool and Stockton, any other conceptual associations beyond the dominant discourse of \nhealth and wellbeing mostly relate to children, and largely reflect achieving economic wellbeing, \none of the goals of central government\u201fs Every Child Matters policy. This then constitutes a \nsecondary discourse of wellbeing specifically in relation to children, also individual in scale, \ndefined objectively by others, a state with component elements although the dynamism of \ndevelopment is noted, positive rather than neutral and with responsibility lying largely with the \nstate and local government.  These two primary discourses echo the national government \nmobilisations of wellbeing.  \n \nHowever, two other wellbeing discourses emerge associated with concepts of community and \nenvironment.  The meanings in relation to community involve desirable attributes such as \n 18 \n \ninclusion, respect and care whilst those in relation to environment include future prospects and \nsustainability. Similarly to the two more dominant discourses, these characteristics of wellbeing \nare mostly defined objectively by others. The term wellbeing is used with positive rather than \nneutral connotations, as in the children and wellbeing discourse. The two discourses differ from \nthe other two in the focus on collective and non-human specific scales. They differ from each \nother in that the community discourse treats wellbeing as a state with component elements such \nas inclusion, respect and care, whilst the environment discourse treats wellbeing as dynamic \nthrough the concerns with sustainability and future prospects.   \n \nCommunity and inclusion and environment and sustainability are in themselves leading concepts \nand issues for contemporary governance and are prominent both in the name and throughout the \nSustainable Community Strategies. Despite this, in relation to wellbeing, they only emerge as \nminor discourses, and only significantly in one of the three strategies.  \n \n3. LOCAL AGENCY AND THE PLACE OF WELLBEING \nThis section examines the discursive practices of key local government officers in relation to the \nfour discourses of wellbeing identified from the Sustainable Community Strategies.  \n \nIn line with the dominant discourse evident in both national and local government documents, the \nlocal government officers most often explicitly connected wellbeing to health:  \n\u201e...it\u201fs interesting that you\u201fve picked it up and said wellbeing, rather than health and \nwellbeing, because I think it\u201fs difficult to separate the two\u201f. \nBut the connection reflects a social model of health in which multiple factors are influential,  \n\u201eIt\u201fs more than the absence of ill-health, it\u201fs about access to wide variety of services, not \nonly just to satisfy needs but those which make better a life\u201f.  \n 19 \n \n\u201eTake the child protection agenda, child abuse, then that\u201fs actually about health and \nwellbeing... about making sure that children and young people are safe... if they\u201fre not \nsafe... they\u201fre not going to grow up, they\u201fll have mental health problems and... not get into \nwork ... and the generations will carry on...\u201f \nThinking about wellbeing through a social model of health requires consideration of the \nconsequences of the actions of other sectors on health which thus broadens the scope of \nresponsibility across government sectors,  \n\u201e...colleagues in the Jobcentre Plus who look at wellbeing in terms of... financial and \neconomic wellbeing, but then actually acknowledging the knock-on effects that has in \nterms of health\u201f. \n\u201eIt\u201fs the benefit of having a health and wellbeing group because ... it\u201fs that different \ncombination, so having someone from regeneration involved in that means that when \nwe\u201fre looking at our new developments... you think of the environment, what will it do .... \n[In terms of] quality of life\u201f \nMoreover, this is an inter-sectoral responsibility that local government officers see taken up, \n\u201eYes, it\u201fs in health and wellbeing but we\u201fve all got to contribute to this.... there\u201fs real \nunderstanding that it involves all of us\u201f \n \nThe reduction of wellbeing to mental or emotional health found in the documents is echoed, but \nagain draws on a broad social model of health, \n\u201eI think prosperity is quite an important area that we need to push but not obviously to the \ndetriment of wellbeing, prosperity at what cost, the pressure that prosperity can bring on \npeople and is the balance right, stresses and strains and balancing that against \nwellbeing.....\u201f \nThe reduction to absence of ill-health is largely avoided by the local officers, \n 20 \n \n\u201eWellbeing is, I would say is, a very generic title, you know. It is about what people \nactually think about their lives. So at the end of the day are they happy with their lives?\u201f \n \nIn contrast to the extensive practice of a health and wellbeing discourse, interviewees draw little \non the secondary discourse in which wellbeing is linked to economic wellbeing of children. The \npresence in the documents reflects central government imperatives to include the Every Child \nMatters goals, but finds little engagement from local government officers beyond repetition of \nthis agenda, \n\u201eFor children and young people, it isn\u201ft about wellbeing overall but it\u201fs about are they a \nproductive member of society\u201f \n\u201eThere\u201fs looking at economic wellbeing, that stems from the ECM framework\u201f \nThe lack of attention to the children and wellbeing discourse indicates that although national \ngovernment rationalities may be operationalised in order to meet national government \nrequirements, they are not necessarily internalised. Moreover, there is no evidence of a conscious \nresistance or conflict in the discursive practices around children and economic wellbeing. \n \nThe relationship with central government in setting indicators and targets shows more explicit \nconflict, \n\u201eThere is always a worry that the central government drive is not always quite the same as \nthe local one.\u201f  \n\u201eIt\u201fs been quite testing particularly when we get down to targets. This is all about \ndelivering the community strategy but of course government have their priorities as well. \nSo there was reconciliation to go on there\u201f \nThese comments belie any notion that the imposition of calculative regimes structures local \nsubjectivities into framing the practices of abstract concepts like wellbeing. Moreover, more \n 21 \n \ndetailed commentaries of how indicators relate to wellbeing show resistance to measurement as \nthe final arbiter,  \n \u201eYou can measure facets of it [wellbeing]. ..but we have to be clear why we\u201fre measuring \nit and how we interpret it\u201f  \n\u201eI don\u201ft think you can measure wellbeing as such\u201f.  \nAssessment not only elicited evidence of resistance conceptually to national government \napproaches, but also local conflicts. A number of local government officers stressed the \nimportance of local negotiation in assessment, \n \u201e...a mix between the sort of lets count it, can we measure it, that performance \nmanagement... it\u201fs just as really important that we care...there was the two camps and \nsomewhere in the middle we managed to come together and say well actually as long as \nwe can count some bits of it and have some subjective bits then that really for us is \nwellbeing.\u201f  \n\u201e...but you can\u201ft escape politics, or can\u201ft come up with the perfect answer [re what \nwellbeing is] so it\u201fs about discussion, negotiation, and reconciliation\u201f  \n \nMost do propose that wellbeing needs breaking down into component elements for assessment. \nNonetheless, several question whether this is enough to capture fully what wellbeing is,  \n\u201eWhether in the end we measure wellbeing or measure strands within that holistic view. \n...whether you can then bunch them all together and say, well, that\u201fs a picture of \nwellbeing, I don\u201ft even begin to know to be honest. I think the best measure is going out \nand talking to people and, you know, trying to synthesise the views as to the state of play.\u201f \n\u201eYou can also think of the well-being of the community which has more factual \ncomponents like a strong economy and low unemployment, transport that works so you \ncan get to where you want to, low crime.  So you\u201fve got all of these factual bases but \nsitting on top of that or generated by it is well-being\u201f  \n 22 \n \nThere was also resistance to a solely objective assessment of wellbeing, equated with indicators, \nviewed as missing important subjective accounts of wellbeing, \n\u201eWe need to measure a bit but also accept that a lot of it is subjective and somewhere \ntogether that will give us a wellbeing type approach\u201f \nNonetheless, whilst local accounts of measurement show a nuanced understanding of wellbeing, \nthe concept is firmly treated as an attribute of individuals and an attribute that is shaped by \nindividual choice and self-government, \n\u201eIt\u201fs more than the absence of ill-health, it\u201fs about access to wide variety of services, not \nonly just to satisfy needs but those which make better a life. In one word it\u201fs about choice \nand creating opportunities for people to have choice and control over their own lives\u201f \n \nThe dominant discourse of health and wellbeing as individual health, as mental health or \nemotional health or as a subjective state was at times explicitly challenged, \n\u201eIt\u201fs about how we live our daily lives, how we get on with our neighbours, how we mix \nin our communities, what events are going on in communities, how and where we go \nshopping, how well we interact all of that stuff is much more important than the NHS and \npolice are to the wellbeing agenda\u201f \nFurther challenges to the dominant discourse position wellbeing as dynamic within a time frame \nor a life-course approach, rather than as a static state,  \n\u201eIt\u201fs very easy to say wellbeing is about mental health but actually aspirations are \nwellbeing, or peace of mind is actually what it\u201fs about. Aspirations have got to be about \npeople tracking a course for themselves and saying they\u201fve achieved it and not just \naccepting what they\u201fve got\u201f \n \nAlthough these framings of wellbeing largely operate at the individual scale, occasionally \nwellbeing is attributed to other scales of analysis. Whilst central government charges local \n 23 \n \ngovernment with responsibility for telling the story of place and for a place-shaping agenda, a \nfew local actors explicitly link this to the concept of wellbeing,  \n\u201eSo the sense of wellbeing through being [....] as a community, we as a public have a \nsense of wellbeing and confidence. The wellbeing of the borough is about the confidence \n... that doesn\u201ft mean over-confidence or misplaced confidence\u201f  \n\u201eSomething else that came through strongly.... the need to build a much stronger, more \ncaring, cohesive community, recognition that we\u201fre getting to be a more diverse \ncommunity, so we get back to sort of core community values. They [the faith and \nvoluntary sectors] would ask really searching questions \u2013 why is prosperity so important, \nwhat do you mean by prosperity, what about spiritual prosperity? And then stuff about \nhealth, what\u201fs wrong with dying?\u201f \nThis resonates with the alternative discourse of community and wellbeing identified from the \nSustainable Community Strategies. The engagement of local government officers with an \nalternative discourse of community and wellbeing, related to issues of care and inclusion, was \nprovoked by central government\u201fs requirement that local authorities work in partnership with \nother local agencies, particularly the voluntary and faith agencies,  \n\u201eQuite often when you produce these types of documents, the public sector dominates the \nculture, but in ours the prevalent and dominant group is the voluntary and community \nsectors and we sat in the LSP [Local Strategic Partnership] with the voluntary sector \nsaying, \u201ethis is our document, the voluntary sector wrote this you know\u201f.  \nThe wider prominence of environment and sustainability in UK governance is little reflected in \nrelation to wellbeing. Moreover, the distinction between current and future wellbeing, as \nexpressed by the notion of sustainability, is explicitly understood as more than environmental,  \n\u201eWellbeing is about sustainability not only in environmental but economic and social \nterms. It\u201fs about creating economic, environmental and social circumstances which can be \n 24 \n \nsustained into the future in ways that don\u201ft disadvantage particular groups or particular \nareas\u201f.  \n \nThese explorations of the engagement of key local government officers with wellbeing in the \nproduction of the Sustainable Community Strategies show local agency capacity to adopt central \ngovernment framings without necessarily internalising these uncritically, to resist and adapt such \nframings for local purposes and to go beyond such framings to reconcile them with alternative \npractices of the concept of wellbeing. Ironically perhaps, the mobilisation of alternative \ndiscourses in local governance is facilitated exactly by some of the requirements placed upon \nlocal government by national guidelines. The adherence to government directives to work in \npartnership with other local actors generated a source of variation in conceptualising wellbeing. \nThe imperative to negotiate indicators and targets brought to the fore debates about what \nwellbeing really is, how it might be captured and assessed and the role of measurement therein.  \n \nThese negotiations around the meanings and practices of wellbeing do suggest that the conceptual \ninstability of wellbeing is problematic for the policy process (Ereaut and Whiting, 2008). But \nwhilst local government officers recognise the challenges of a broad, abstract concept such as \nwellbeing in policy, they also stress its importance, \n\u201eThe sense of wellbeing is about having a vision for our communities, for our places. \nPlace-shaping is effectively about the same, so sustainability, wellbeing, place-shaping - \nthey\u201fre all terms that don\u201ft easily define themselves and are open, of course, to being \ndefined differently and exploited because of that. But I think when you\u201fre talking about \nwhat we\u201fre doing here, which is about defining a vision for the future, then they are \nessential concepts\u201f.  \nIndeed, it may be that it is this very instability of the term wellbeing that infuses it with the \npotential to serve a creative function in locally negotiated priorities. This proposition is supported \n 25 \n \nby local actors both in the quotations above relating to the measurement of wellbeing, and here, \nexplicitly positioning instability in the term wellbeing as a provocation to creative discussion and \nthinking and the forging of partnerships:  \n\u201cI think that in a way because they [the terms wellbeing, sustainability and place shaping] \nare not easily defined it is quite useful because it gives people a chance to sit down and  \nthrash out what they, as a community, mean by that and that\u201fs more important than one \nperson like me writing clever words in a document.  It's actually getting people together \nand agreeing what they are about\u201d  \n

THE PLACE AND PRACTICES OF WELLBEING IN LOCAL \nGOVERNANCE \nThe co-presence in the same documents of a mix of dominant and other more minor discourses of \nwellbeing supports the characterisation of the concept of wellbeing as confused and \ncontradictory. However, we argue against those who position this instability as problematic and \nof necessity indicating the need for more precise definition and measurement. Instead, we see the \nconceptual instability of wellbeing as enabling the local expression of voices contesting dominant \nideologies of the self, responsibility and governance. \n \nThe mobilisation of wellbeing common in academia and in the mass press indicates how the \nconcept might encapsulate the rationale for self-responsibilisation and self-actualisation within a \nneoliberal governance regime. However, for this to be realised, the holistic resonance of \nwellbeing requires work on boundary setting to translate the concept into a measurable entity. \nThe responsibilisation of the individual within neoliberalism makes it logical that wellbeing will \nbe conceived of as an attribute of the individual. The need to translate any notion of wellbeing \ninto performance indicators favours an approach that breaks the concept down into component \n 26 \n \nparts. This is broadly consistent with much of the academic literature in which dimensions cover \na wide range of facets of human life (Nussbaum, 2000; Stiglitz et al., 2009). However, the \nnational and local policy vision documents, and often the key local actors, narrow the concept far \nmore tightly through a dominant discourse of wellbeing as inseparably connected to health. This \ntightly bounded definition brings important losses in the potential value of the term. The cooption \nof wellbeing as an adjunct to health risks reducing the term to a mere synonym and the discursive \npractice of wellbeing in the national White Paper does just this. In the local Sustainable \nCommunity Strategies, further reductions are seen when the phrase indicates mental wellbeing, or \neven the absence of mental ill-health and concentrates on demographically defined and static \ncategories such as children or the elderly rather than the continuous production of health \nthroughout the life-course. Even when wellbeing is framed into a social model of health, the \ndominance of health and wellbeing as a discourse undermines the potential for wellbeing to \nfunction as an inter-sectoral unifying concept. \n \nThe empirical mapping to identify different discourses of wellbeing by themes and dimensions \ncomplements Dean\u201fs (2003) conceptual matrix of potential negotiations of wellbeing by \ndimensions of welfare regime. The dominant discourses, and their associated reductions, of \nhealth and wellbeing and of children and wellbeing resonate with Dean\u201fs pole of contractarian \nwelfare regimes. The alternative discourses of community and wellbeing and of environment and \nwellbeing which involve collective and non-human scales, sustainability in relation to wellbeing, \nrespect and care, resonate with the opposite pole of solidaristic traditions. However, although \nDean\u201fs dimensions were elaborated for \u201edifferent social and political contexts\u201f (2003: 2), the \nconfusion and contradiction within discursive practices across and within three similar local \nauthorities demonstrates the co-existence of different \u201emoral and political accounts\u201f of  wellbeing \nin the same social and political context. The local non-governmental and faith organisations had a \nkey role in effecting the inclusion of elements of an alternative welfare regime into neoliberal \n 27 \n \nframings. The particular significance here is that, first, the expression of this alternative framing \nis effected through the mobilisation of distinct discourses of wellbeing and, secondly, that it is \nexactly the conceptual vagueness of the concept of wellbeing that enables potentially oppositional \nframings to co-exist creatively within a single local authority strategy.  \n \nAn open category of wellbeing provides an ideal conceptual tool through which to negotiate \ntensions between alternative political and moral accounts in relation to performance and \nresponsibility. We propose that conceptual complexity and instability has inherent value for local \ngovernance; the danger lies in narrowing the scope of the concept. Much research within the \ngovernmentality tradition has focussed on local resistance to monitoring, the calculative regimes \nof governance. But the key task for releasing the potential of wellbeing as an emergent tool of \nneoliberal governance is boundary work to narrow the scope of how the concept is practised and \nthis should be the key arena for resistance. Already the mobilisation of wellbeing other than as an \noutcome of self-management is practised only as minor discourses. Wellbeing needs to be seen \nnot only as the final goal and outcome of government policy, requiring closed definition and \nmonitoring, but more importantly as part of the dynamics of the policy process, a stimulus to \ncritical debate about the nature of overarching policy goals.  The emergent and potential power of \nthe term wellbeing is not as a calculative but a conceptual technology in which wellbeing is best \ncomprehended as constellations of discursive practices through which place-shaping strategies \nmay be negotiated and reconciled locally. \n 28 \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBarnett N, 2003, \u201cLocal government, New Labour and \u201eActive Welfare\u201f: a case of \u201eself \nresponsibilisation?\u201d  Public policy and administration 18 25-38 \n \nBinkley S, 2007, \u201cGovernmentality and lifestyle studies\u201d Sociology Compass 1 111\u2013126 \n \nClarke J, 2004, \u201cDissolving the Public Realm?
