The depth-of-penetration technique \nwas originally developed by Rosenberg and his colleagues [1] as a method to \nsuppress the tensile stresses in the ceramic tile that would otherwise be present \nwhen a thin backing was used. Over the past 20 years there have been numerous \nstudies that have used this technique in the study of the response of the target \nmaterial that have been subjected to impact by small-arms bullets [3-8] and rods [9-\n12]. The advantage of this method is that it is relatively cheap to establish \nperformance criteria for the armour tile in question however its disadvantage is that \nthe semi-infinite backing is not representative of an armour system and therefore its \nvalue is in assessing comparative tile performance. These performance criteria are \nderived from the measured reduction in penetration and the mass of material \nrequired to reduce the penetration depth. Good reviews of the various approaches \nare provided by James [13], Normandia and Gooch [14] and Walley [15]. \nUsing this technique, Rosenberg and Yeshurun [1] observed a linear \ncorrelation between the ballistic efficiency of a ceramic and a normalised strength \nparameter. This strength parameter was defined as the average of the dynamic and \nstatic yield strengths of the ceramic divided by the density of the tile. In this work, \ntwo calibres of similar steel-cored projectiles were used and it was noted that the \nballistic efficiency was not sensitive to the projectile\u2019s dimensions. Work by \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 3 \nWoodward and Baxter [3] included the study of the penetration of high quality \n99.5% alumina tiles backed with semi-infinite metal plates by both sharp and blunt \ntungsten alloy and hard steel projectiles. Using three different backing plate \nmaterials they showed that merit ratings which quantify the performance of the \nceramic against the impacting projectile, are a function of the projectile type and of \nthe backing material. They pointed out that this test method is a measure of two \nparameters: (1) the ability of the ceramic to destroy the projectile tip and; (2) the \nability to defeat the penetrator by velocity reduction and erosive mass loss. Their \nresults were also in keeping with the observations of Rosenberg et al. [16] who \nshowed that the measured ballistic efficiencies were affected by the test conditions. \nFurther work by Woodward et al. [17] showed that during depth-of-penetration \ntesting of a confined ceramic-faced target (AD 85), the calculated mean resisting \nstress could not be reconciled with the hardness of the material. In this case the \nmean resisting stress was calculated from a consideration of the conservation of \nenergy during penetration. Nevertheless, they also found that for a confined glass \ntarget, their value of mean resisting stress was similar to the hardness of the \nmaterial. However, both of these targets were tested with the impact side confined \nby a 6.35 mm 2024 T351 aluminium-alloy plate bolted to a steel surround and it is \nwell known that confinement can significantly enhance the performance of a \nceramic armour due to a ceramic\u2019s propensity to pressure harden [e.g.,18]. \nA quantifiable measure of the mean resistance during penetration of a target \ntile is important as it provides a measure of the ballistic performance of the \nmaterial. In particular for a ceramic material, this value will include a contribution \nof the strength offered by the comminuted \/ damage materials as well as the strength \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 4 \nof the intact material offered to the projectile during penetration. This value is \nimportant for the validation of analytical models where the measurement of the \nstrength of the damaged material is still not possible.  \nIn this work, a model has been developed based on [17] to calculate the \nmean resisting stress offered by a brittle tile to a penetrating projectile. Further, the \nperformance of several unconfined materials subjected to complete penetration by a \nhard tungsten carbide-cored projectile has been evaluated in an attempt to quantify \nthe resistance offered by each material.  \n \nEXPERIMENTAL SET-UP \n \nMaterials used \nFor the backing material used in these DOP experiments, a common \nengineering aluminium alloy Al 6082 T651 was chosen (YS = 240 MPa). The test \nbacking-plates were 100 \u00d7 100 mm pieces cut from a single 25 mm thick plate. For \neach tile of specific thickness (ts), a single bullet was fired at the target and the \nresidual penetration (pr) into the aluminium alloy was measured (see Fig. 1); at least \nthree experiments were done for each material. \n \nFig 1: DOP technique for assessing each sample\u2019s ballistic performance; (a) without target \nsample in place and, (b) with target sample in place. \n \nEight brittle materials were tested in this study: Sintox FA (a sintered  \nalumina \u2013 95% content) manufactured by Morgan Matroc Ltd; ALOTEC - 96SB (a \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 5 \nsintered alumina \u2013 96% content) manufactured by CeramTec-ETEC GmbH; AD995 \n(a sintered alumina -- 99.5% content) manufactured by CoorsTek; a sintered silicon \ncarbide manufactured by Morgan AM&T (PS5000); a common-off-the-shelf \nFloatglass; Borofloat\u2122 manufactured by SCHOTT Technical Glass Solutions \nGmbH and finally; two glass ceramics (LZ1 and MAS-6). All tiles were 100 mm \u00d7 \n100 mm in areal size except for the thinnest Sintox FA, 96SB and PS5000 targets. \nThese were 50 \u00d7 50 mm in size but were confined by like-material tiles at each edge \nto provide an effective 100 mm \u00d7 100 mm geometry. \nThe elastic properties of the materials were established ultrasonically using \nPanametrics\u2019 5MHz longitudinal and shear-wave probes with the pulse-echo \nmethod. The hardness values (HV0.5 \/ HV2.0) were calculated from a series of \nmicro-hardness tests using an Indentec HWDM7.  The properties of the materials \nused in this experimental programme are presented in Table 1. All of the ceramic \nmaterials were tested according to HV2.0; the two glasses were tested to HV0.5 due \nto the difficulty in establishing an impression at higher loads. \nEach tile was glued to the aluminium alloy-backing block using Araldite \n2015. This was applied to the mating surfaces and then the ceramic and aluminium \nblock were pushed together and twisted \/ oscillated until an even thin adhesive line \nhad been achieved with no gaps or obvious air inclusions. This was done to achieve \na consistent contact between the ceramic and the aluminium for all samples tested. \nTable 1: Properties of the materials tested (in order of hardness). \n \n \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 6 \nImpact testing \nThe range set up was one of a fixed test barrel mounted ten metres from the \ntarget. Bullet velocity was measured using the normal light-screen arrangement. \nThe test ammunition was 7.62 mm \u00d7 51 mm NATO FFV ammunition that \ngenerated a mean bullet velocity of 935 m\/s. This bullet consists of a tungsten \ncarbide core (composition by percentage weight C 5.2, W 82.6, Co 10.5, Fe 0.41) \n[20] of hardness 1550 [HV0.3], mounted in a low carbon steel jacket with gilding \nmetal, on an aluminium cup. The measured hardness values of the steel jacket were \n184 [HV0.3] at the base and 220 [HV0.3] at the tip. The measurement of the masses \nof the core and the bullet were 5.90 g and 8.23 g respectively. Key dimensions of \nthe core are shown below in Fig. 2. \n \nFig. 2: Key dimensions of the WC-Co FFV core; all dimensions are in mm. \n \nAfter testing the aluminium alloy blocks were either sectioned or X-rayed to \nestablish the residual penetration.  \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nThe ballistic model \nThe kinetic energy of the projectile can be broken down as follows: \n \ncupjcp EEEKE ++=         (1) \n \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 7 \nwhere Ec, Ej, Ecup represent the kinetic energy of the three constituent parts of the \nprojectile \u2013 namely: the core, jacket and aluminium cup respectively. The kinetic \nenergy of the cup (mass = 0.3 g) is a tiny proportion of the total kinetic energy and \ntherefore is subsequently ignored. \nFig. 3 shows a typical post-mortem X-ray of the cavity formed during \npenetration of the aluminium alloy by the bullet. Here the velocity of impact was \n1088 m\/s. There are a few things to point out here. Firstly, during penetration of the \nfirst 25 mm of aluminium alloy, the jacket is stripped away enabling the core to \npenetrate into the aluminium alloy; the penetration channel that is formed is \napproximately the same diameter as the core (5.59 mm). Secondly, radial expansion \nin the aluminium alloy occurs \u2013 probably during the jacket-stripping process. \nThirdly and finally, the core of the projectile is seen to remain intact. \n \nFig. 3: Penetration of the FFV core into the aluminium alloy plates. \n \nIt is assumed that all the kinetic energy of the projectile (KEp) is given up in \npenetrating aluminium alloy plate. Consequently, the significant energy \ncontributions required to penetrate the aluminium alloy is made up of several major \nparts as given by the following energy balance consisting of three variables that \ndepend on the amount of kinetic energy in the projectile, KEp. \n \nal\np\nal\nr\njacket\nsp EEEKE ++=       (2) \n \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 8 \nwhere jacketsE  and \nal\nrE  are the energy required to separate the jacket from the core \nand the energy required to cause radial expansion of the aluminium alloy during the \njacket-stripping process respectively. alpE  is the energy required by the remaining \ncore to penetrate a distance pr into the plate. It is assumed that alrE  represent small \ncontributions of the total kinetic energy of the bullet due to the small volume of \ncavity expansion that follows in the aluminium. The energy required to strip the \njacket is also deemed to be small quantity (see later). \nWhen a target sample is adhered to the face of the aluminium (see Fig. 1b), \nthe kinetic energy of the projectile is given up in penetrating both the target sample \nand the aluminium alloy according to the following equation: \n \nal\np\nal\nr\njacket\ns\nsample\npp EEEEKE +++=      (3) \n \nwhere samplepE  represents the energy dissipated by the sample. Again, \njacket\nsE  and \nal\nrE  represent small contributions of the total kinetic energy of the bullet and are \nconsequently ignored. Therefore, the energy dissipated by the sample, samplepE , can \nbe calculated from \nal\npp\nsample\np EKEE \u2212=        (4). \n \nFor a sample of thickness tc, the mean resisting force, Fr , can be calculated \nby \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 9 \n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1=\nc\nsample\np\nr t\nE\nF         (5) \n \nTherefore, ignoring frictional effects applied to the periphery of the \nprojectile core and assuming a constant areal contact, the mean resisting stress can \nbe calculated by dividing the mean resisting force by the projected area offered by \nthe core: \n2\n4\nd\nFr\nr \u03c0\u03c3 =         (6) \n \nThis is analogous to the measurement of hardness using a conical indentor \n[21] and is assumed to represent the average value of strength for the tile during \npenetration. \n \nStripping the jacket \nIn order to get an estimate of the amount of energy required to strip the \njacket from the cores during penetration ( )jacketsE , the jacket was stripped by \npressing a bullet into a conically-shaped die using an Instron 4206 universal testing \nmachine. The die possessed an angle of 45\u00ba from the vertical axis and was made \nfrom high strength steel (EN 24). The tip (c.a. 5 mm) of the bullet jacket was \nremoved prior to the pressing trial to aid in the stripping process.  Fig. 4 shows the \n7.62 mm bullet uses in these experimental trials showing the jacket before and after \nthe stripping process (prior to tip removal); the core and the aluminium cup are also \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 10 \nshown. The jacket stripped in an almost symmetrical fashion with the formation of \n5 petals. \nFig 4: 7.62 mm bullet, core, stripped jacket and cup. \n \nFig 5: Compression of the bullet into a conically-shaped die: Load-displacement and \ncumulative energy-displacement. \n \nFig. 5 shows a typical force-displacement curve; also shown is a calculation \nof the cumulative energy expended during the compression process calculated by \nintegrating the area under the force-displacement curve. There are three points to \nnote. Firstly, at A, there is a rapid rise in the measured load. It is believed that \nresistance is offered by the radially expanding neck of the jacket as it pressed into \nthe die until at B, fracture occurs and the jacket is torn in 5 separate locations. This \nprocess occurs for c.a. 6-7 mm; the load measured at the platens reduces as the tears \nin the thin steel jacket allow for the bullet to continue onward. Eventually at C, the \ncurled-up tears are themselves compressed by the platens denoted by an increase in \nmeasured force. This ordinarily would not occur when a bullet penetrates a ceramic-\nfaced target and therefore from this point forward, the data was ignored. From our \ntests we would estimate that the energy required to strip a jacket from the bullet is \nof the order of 50 J \u2013 100 J. This represents 1%-2% of the bullet\u2019s initial kinetic \nenergy and therefore is deemed to be negligible. Nevertheless, it should be noted \nthat this approach can only give a rough estimate of the energy stripped from the \njacket during penetration as it fails to take into account strain-rate and inertial \neffects. \n \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 11 \nTherefore Equation (3) can be rewritten as \n \n  alpp EKE =        (7) \n \nPenetration into the aluminium alloy \nA series of firings were conducted into the aluminium alloy used in this \nexperimental programme. No ceramic \/ glass targets were adhered to the aluminium \nin this case. The purpose of this was to establish a calibration line from which the \nenergy expended in penetrating a depth pal could be derived. As can be seen from \nFig. 6, the depth varies linearly with the kinetic energy of the bullet over the \nkinetic-energy range of interest according to: \nBKEAp pal +\u22c5=       (8) \nwhere the measured constants A and B were 0.0147 and 5.0469 respectively. \n \nFig 6: Depth-of-penetration into the aluminium alloy (6082-T651) plate with varying bullet \nkinetic energy. \n \nPenetration of the glass and ceramic-faced aluminium targets \nFig. 7 shows the calculated transfer of energy from the projectile to two of \nthe sample materials where the tile thickness was varied (Sintox FA and \nBorofloat\u2122). For each sample, a linear increase in energy absorbed is seen. Here, \nthe gradient of the line approximates the average resisting force applied by the \nceramic \/ glass and is constant for the increasing thickness. \n \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 12 \nFig 7: Energy dissipated by the tiles with increasing thickness. \n \nIt was noted in certain instances that, despite the core appearing to be intact, \npost-mortem analysis revealed that it was fractured. Nevertheless, where fracturing \nof the core or tip occurred, the energy consumed by the generation of fracture \nsurfaces was assumed to be minimal and consideration of this energy required can \nbe pursued by using the work of Grady [22]. In this work, fracture surface energy \nper unit volume, \u0393, required to create fragments of size s in a brittle material can be \napproximated by \n \nsc\nKc\n2\n0\n23\n\u03c1=\u0393        (9) \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 13 \nwhere Kc is the fracture toughness, \u03c1 is the density and s is the fragment size. If the \nbody is broken into fragments of size s, a fracture surface area per unit volume \nequal to 6 \/ s is created. co is the bulk wave speed calculated from \n \n\u03c1\nKc =0        (10) \n \nwhere K is the bulk modulus of the material and for a similar material has been \nmeasured to be 364 GPa [23]. Even with conservative estimates of the fracture \ntoughness for the WC-Co core being 10 MPa\u221am, and breaking down the core into \nfragments of 1 mm, the fracture surface energy dissipated in this process is very \nsmall (< 1 J).  \n Fig. 8 shows the average resisting stress for each of the samples tested as a \nfunction of the thickness of the tile. There are variations in the PS 5000 and AD995 \nresults which may be down to defects within the ceramics. On the most part, the \nmean resisting stress was constant regardless of the thickness of the tile. This result \nis somewhat surprising as stress-wave effects would ordinarily be expected to \ndamage the material ahead of the penetrator thereby reducing the average strength \nas the thickness is increased. Consequently the near-constant value of mean \nresisting stress (or strength) seen here suggest that damage to the material during \npenetration is either relatively small ahead of the penetrator or the inertial \nconfinement offered by the surrounding tile material restricts fractured material \ndilation. This is in keeping with the observations of Shockey et al. [24] who \nobserved that the strength of compacted comminuted ceramic recovered from a \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 14 \npenetration cavity after high-velocity rod penetration was comparable to that of un-\nimpacted material. \nThe higher-resisting-stress materials (PS5000, AD995 and 96SB) fractured \nthe core tip at relatively low thicknesses and consequently a trend was not \nestablished for these materials. Nevertheless, the resisting stress that is offered by \nthese ceramics was still quantifiable for the given thickness.  \n \nFig 8:  Average resisting stress offered by the ceramic materials. \n \nBelow in Fig. 9, we have plotted the average resisting stress as a function of \nthe  hardness of the ceramic. The central 1:1 dashed line indicates the case where \nthe average resisting stress is equal to the measured hardness values of the \nmaterials. It can be seen that the calculated strength results lie very close to this 1:1 \nline. This suggests that in the DOP configuration, and where the core remains fully \nintact, the test will not measure the true ballistic properties of the target material in \nquestion. For a ceramic, this is all the more crucial as the true ballistic properties of \nthe material are not defined by one single parameter such as hardness [11,25]. \n However, Woodward et al [17] noticed that for a confined AD 85 sample the \nmean resisting stress offered by the AD 85 sample was far higher than hardness \nvalue measured for this sample (8.8 GPa).  Their targets were tested using a \nconfined set-up with a 6.35-mm 2024 T351 aluminium alloy cover plate bolted to a \nsteel surround and consequently the experimental set-up is somewhat different to \nthis work. This excessively high value of resisting stress appears to contradict the \nresults presented here. The reason for this is not clear but it may be due to the fact \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 15 \nthat Woodward et al. relied on a single data point for the aluminium calibration and \ndid not take into account the energy absorbed by the front cover plate. More likely \nis that these results may point to the possibility that the presence of Woodward\u2019s \ncover-plate significantly increased the penetration-resistance of the AD 85. It is \nknown that adding confinement to ceramics increases its ballistic performance as \ndoes pre-stress and this is largely due to the pressure dependency of ceramic \n[24,26]. On the other hand for a similarly confined glass target, Woodward et al. \nshowed that the mean resisting stress was approximately the same as the measured \nhardness value for they glass. They noted that it was surprising that the resisting \nstress offered to the projectile was similar to its hardness as fracture would have \nreduced its strength. Consequently, it would have fallen below the 1:1 trend line if \nthe glass was not confined. This work indicates that this is the case for unconfined \ntargets. Indeed, analysis of Prengal\u2019s results [27], who used the same ammunition as \nthis work,  showed that the introduction of 2-mm thick aluminium cover plate to a \nsoda-lime glass target led to a 20% reduction in depth-of-penetration of a mild steel \nwitness plate. This would have resulted in a higher mean resisting stress. \n However, it should also be noted that most of the data presented below in \nFigure 9 sits very close to the 1:1 line. The penetrator will be penetrating through \nfractured material whereas a hardness test will predominately inelastically deform \nthe sample. Therefore, it appears that the effect of a reduction in material strength \ndue to fracturing ahead of the penetrator is relatively small in this experimental set-\nup. This is most likely due to inertial confinement offered by the (still) intact \nsurrounding material combined with possible pressure-related strengthening effects \nof the fractured \/ comminuted material (e.g., see [28]). \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 16 \n  \nFig 9: Calculated resisting stress as plotted against the measured hardness values. \n \n \nComparison with data for shattered ceramic \n \nHallas [29] has conducted depth-of-penetration studies using a ceramic-\nfaced aluminium alloy. The ceramic used was Sintox FA; 7018 aluminium alloy \nwas used as the backing plate. Uniquely Hallas tested shattered and powdered \nceramic in attempt to elucidate the effect of a damage state on penetration. An intact \nceramic was also tested.  \nA calibration curve for a similar aluminium alloy was established in an \nattempt to evaluate whether Hallas\u2019 data could be used to establish the strength of \ncomminuted material. Consequently firings into a 1318B alloy (very similar to \n7018) were carried out resulting in a linear calibration according to Equation 9 \nwhere the measured constants A and B were 0.0112 and 2.4478 respectively. \nUnfortunately, individual velocities for each experiment were not recorded \nby Hallas nevertheless, based on the average bullet velocity from this experimental \nprogramme (935 m\/s) it was possible to calculate the mean resisting stress for each \nof Hallas\u2019s samples. These were (a) a 6 mm intact Sintox FA tile; (b) 6 mm tiles \nshattered by a 5 g of PE4 explosive; (c) 9 mm of compressed 80 \u03bcm alumina \npowder (compressed under a pressure of 40 MPa using an iso-static press) and; (d) \n37.5 mm of compressed 80 \u03bcm alumina powder. The powder used was mostly \nspherical in shape. The reported results and calculated mean resisting stress based \non the method presented above are presented in Table 2. \n \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 17 \nTable 2: Hallas\u2019 DOP results showing the calculated resisting stress using the technique \npresented above. \n \nHallas noticed that the shattered tiles had been broken into particle sizes of between \n10-20 microns whilst maintaining inter-granular coupling. Consequently, these \nresult do point to the fact that when the ceramic is shattered or even powdered (i.e., \nheavily comminuted), it retains significant strength during penetration \n(approximately 10%). Given that these experiments were carried out without a \ncover-plate in place, the bulk of the shattered\/ powdered material would have most \nlikely moved \/ flowed during penetration and therefore the strength values listed \nabove represent a lower bound to the actual strength of the broken material in a \nceramic penetration experiment. Consequently, this adds weight to the evidence that \nrelatively little strength reduction occurs purely due to crack propagation when the \ndamaged material is inertially confined. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nIn this paper it has been shown that it is possible to estimate a value of the \nmean resisting stress offered to a projectile that is penetrating the target in a rigid \nfashion. It was notable that different ceramics offered different resisting stress and \nalthough this is somewhat intuitive, we have been able to quantify the value for a \nseries of materials for the first time. Notably, it was shown that in the depth-of-\npenetration experimental configuration, the values of the mean resisting stresses \nappeared to correlate with the hardness of the materials.  This perhaps is intuitive as \nin this experimental configuration we are essentially replicating a loading condition \nAdvances in Applied Ceramics 109 (8) pp. 504-510 (2010) \n 18 \nthat is similar in to a dynamic hardness experiment. Therefore, under such \nconditions, where the core is not destroyed, the intrinsic ballistic properties of the \ntile will not be measured. Such ballistic properties should only be interpreted where \nthe core of the bullet has been fractured and fragmented. \nThe calculated mean resisting stresses also appeared to remain constant over \nincreasing thickness of tile. Consequently, these results indicate that where the core \nremains intact, the effect of a reduction in material strength due to fracturing ahead \nof the penetrator is relatively small. This is most likely due to inertial confinement \noffered by the (still) intact surrounding material combined with possible pressure-\nrelated strengthening effects of the fractured \/ comminuted material. Finally, it has \nbeen shown that the strength of unconfined broken \/ comminuted ceramic is \nsignificant during penetration and, for the first time under these loading conditions, \nhas been quantified. \n  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n \nThe author particularly wish to thank Morgan AM & T and ETEC for providing \nfree samples for this study.
