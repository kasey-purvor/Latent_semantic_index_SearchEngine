Unlike\nconferences or special issues, we do not solicit research on any particular theme; thus\nthe submissions we receive act as a kind of weather vane for current research topics.\nInterestingly, this issue seems to be spread across a broad spectrum of pedagogic\nconcerns, but is unusually focused (for this journal) on the practices of teaching.\nDigital portfolios have been linked to a number of pedagogies and policies that are\ngrowing in importance, so it was good to receive a piece that provides a critical and\nanalytical review of experience with these. Clegg et al. raise interesting research issues\nabout the form of such writing for assessment; it will be interesting to see how the\nforthcoming one-day Association for Learning and Technology conference on\n\u2018Reflective learning, future thinking\u2019 builds upon such work.\nIn the other articles, the topic of assessment is revisited (by Conole and Warburton),\nbuilding on the discussions in the previous issue. Questions of course design and prac-\ntice are raised by de Boer and Collis, focusing on the issue of increasing flexsibility for\nstudents. Equally concerned with student support, Smith and Oliver explore the ways\nin which students\u2019 information literacy are developed. Finally, Ip et al. explore a\nspecific application designed to home students\u2019 decision-making and problem-solving\nskills.\nAlthough this is not a special issue, this array of articles spans the lifecycle of many\ncourses. How should we design it? What pedagogies shall we adopt (particularly if we\nare concerned with reflection and relevance)? How can we be sure students will make\ngood use of the resources available to them? And how can we then assess them?\nSerendipity is a marvellous thing.\nOn a slightly different note, keen readers will notice a slight change in the format\nfor this issue. Instead of our normal discussion section, we have included a positional\narticle by Helen Beetham, who has been acting as a consultant to the UK\u2019s Joint\nInformaton Systems Committee on their e-learning programme. One stand of this\nwork\u2014concerning pedagogies for e-learning\u2014has recently produced a series of\nrecommendations, some of which the Joint Information Systems Committee (who\n2 Editorial\nare not a research council) are unable to pursue. This seemed to us to be one of those\nmoments when the outcomes of research can either be lost or else brought to the\nattention of the wider community, so we decided to present this because of its\npotential value of researchers. (We also felt that the discussion section was a little\nsuperfluous this time around, following the rich series of articles on Computer Aided\nAssessment in the previous issue, together with the review article on this topic here.)\nIf you are researching one of these topics, for example, it signals that we would be\ninterested to see the outcomes of your work in ALT-J. If you are not researching any\nof these areas, you might feel that what you are investigating is so important that it\nshould be highlighted rather than allowing such positional statements to neglect it. Or\nyou might find it useful in highlighting an area of currently neglected work to pursue.\nHowever you engage with it, we hope that it proves stimulating.\nMartin Oliver\nInstitute of Education, UK\n"}
