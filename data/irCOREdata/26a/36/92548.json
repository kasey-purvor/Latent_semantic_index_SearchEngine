The public \nhave become concerned about protecting children at risk.  Their concern has been intensified by tragic and \nhighly publicised deaths of children at the hands of their parents.  In Britain, these have led to a series of \npublic inquiries into how professionals dealt with each case. Inquiries have also been held into cases of \nsuspected child sexual abuse where it seemed that professionals were removing children too readily and \ncausing serious trauma to families (Dept of Health, 1988 and Scottish Office, 1992). \n \nComplete accuracy is an unreal expectation but, in some of these cases, it appeared that, on the evidence \navailable, professionals drew the wrong conclusions and that the subsequent tragedies and distress could \nhave been averted.  For instance, the inquiry into the death of Jasmine Beckford while under the \nsupervision of the Social Services Department concluded that her death was: 'both a predictable and \npreventible homicide' (London Borough of Brent, 1985, p.287). The Carlile inquiry reached a similar \njudgement: 'we conclude that Kimberley Carlile's death was avoidable through the intervention of welfare \nagencies' (London Borough of Greenwich, 1987, p.216). \n \nIt soon became apparent that the inquiries were producing similar criticisms of the services provided to the \nchild and family. Reviews of a number of reports sought to identify the recurrent mistakes (DHSS, 1982 \nand Dept. of Health, 1991a). But it is proving difficult to improve practice substantially. Dingwall (1986, \np.489) comments on the repetitive character of the findings of inquiries, suggesting that: 'these inquiries \n  \n \n3\nare actually failing to make any lasting impact on the everyday practice of the occupations and \norganisations under scrutiny'.  In its second review of inquiries, the Department of Health notes that there \nis still no systematic monitoring to establish whether workers are learning from mistakes but that tragedies \nare still occurring and there is no evidence of improvement (1991a, p.109). Children continue to die and \npublic inquiries continue to be held at the rate of one or two a year. \n \nThis research project started from the premise that we would be better able to devise guidelines to improve \npractice if we understand not only which mistakes keep recurring but why they do so. Time and resources  \nare obvious constraints on practice but the focus of this study was on the reasoning processes of the \nprofessionals involved. The project involved a content analysis of inquiry reports over a twenty year \nperiod, in a framework derived from psychological research on human reasoning. \n  \nHuman reasoning \nIn the centuries-old study of reasoning, two major forms have been commonly identified: analytic and  \nintuitive.  Analytic reasoning is characterised as \u2018a step-by-step, conscious, logically defensible process\u2019 \n(Hammond, 1996, p.60).   Intuitive reasoning typically means the opposite: \u2018a cognitive  process that \nsomehow produces an answer, solution or idea without the use of a conscious, logically defensible, step-\nby-step process\u2019 (Hammond, 1996, p.60).   \n \nThey are often presented as rival forms of thought with people taking a partisan view of their respective \nmerits. Analytic reasoning has the advantage of being clear and explicit about how it reaches a conclusion. \n It is identified with logic, mathematics and rigorous thought that can be defended by reference to reliable, \npublic standards of ascertainable truth.  Intuition, on the other hand, is associated with creativity, \nimagination and imagery but its critics accuse it of being irrational and obscurantist, producing ideas \nwithout clear justification.  Critics of analytic thinking, however, argue that too much is claimed for it; in \n  \n \n4\ncomplex situations, there will always be too many unknown variables to disturb the  picture and to falsify \nthe precise predictions of analytic reasoning based only on the known variables.  The strengths of intuition \nare displayed in situations needing a rapid digest of numerous factors, such as in human interactions.  \n \nIn the caring professions, there has always been controversy about which form of reasoning is most \nappropriate.  In social work debates about the nature of social work knowledge and skill, those advocating \na scientific approach exemplify the analytic tradition while their opponents have argued that practice must \nrest on intuitive and empathic understanding of our fellow humans (see Chapter Three, Munro, 1998).  \nMedicine has featured a comparable dispute.  In recent years, those arguing for an analytic, scientific \napproach have been dominant but they have been challenged by those claiming that the doctor-patient \nrelationship, based on intuitive understanding, is a crucial element of healing. \n \nIn the often-heated arguments between analytic and intuitive thinkers, the two approaches tend to be \npresented as  rivals.  Hammond (1996), however, offers the far more constructive idea that these two \ndimensions of human cognitive capacity should be seen as existing on a continuum, not as a dichotomy.  \nHe argues that questions about which is better can only be answered relative to a particular context and \ntask. In science, for example, philosophers have made the distinction between the context of formulating a \ntheory and of testing it (e.g.Kuhn, 1970).  The former is seen to be an intuitive move, going beyond the \nmechanics of data collection to create hypotheses containing novel concepts or novel relationships \nbetween concepts.  These products of intuition, however, then need to be corroborated by using deductive \nlogic to derive predictions whose truth or falsity can be ascertained by experiments. \n \nIn child protection work, the two forms of reasoning are easily discernible.  In practice, many \nprofessionals, especially social workers, rely heavily on intuitive skills (Farmer and Owen, 1995, Thorpe, \n1994, Parsloe and Stevenson, 1978).  Efforts to improve practice tend to take an analytic form, e..g. the \n  \n \n5\ndevelopment of risk assessment instruments, checklists and guidelines.  \n \nThere is a large body of psychological research that demonstrates the defects of intuitive skills. \nKleinmuntz and Schkade (1993), reviewing the findings, conclude: \u2018two decades of research have \nemphasised the shortcomings of human judgement and decision-making processes\u2019.   Hammond  \ncomments  that: \nNo one can read through the literature of social psychology from the 1960s through the 1980s \nwithout drawing the conclusion that intuition is a hazard, a process not to be trusted, not only \nbecause it is inherently flawed by \u2018biases\u2019 but because the person who resorts to it is innocently \nand sometimes arrogantly overconfident when employing it (Hammond, 1996, p88).                    \n                       \nIn making everyday judgements, people take mental shortcuts.  If they were perfectly rational, they would \ncarefully consider all the relevant evidence before reaching a conclusion, as professionals are urged to do \nin practice guidelines for child protection work.  But this creates a cost\/benefit problem.  It has the benefit \nof leading to the conclusion most likely to be correct on available knowledge but it is expensive in time \nand effort. People generally prefer to find ways of simplifying reasoning by taking shortcuts, risking a \nhigher level of error. Research in psychology has shown that people are not, on the whole, rational \nthinkers who have occasional lapses.  Instead, they tend to prefer imperfect but easier ways of reasoning. \nThey create rules that reduce difficult judgmental tasks to simpler ones by restricting the amount of \ninformation they consider. These rules are good enough in many everyday circumstances but, in some \ncircumstances, they lead to: 'large and persistent biases with serious implications for decision-making' \n(Kahneman, Slovic and Tversky, 1990, p.464). \n \nThis study examined the hypothesis that many of the recurrent mistakes contributing to tragic outcomes \nare due to the bias introduced by using everyday habits of reasoning in assessing and reviewing cases.  \n \nMethodology \nThe study examined all available child abuse inquiry reports published in Britain between 1973 and 1994  \n  \n \n6\n- a total of forty five reports (listed in Appendix A).   One other report (Humberside Child Protection \nCommittee, 1990) was excluded because only the conclusions were made public and these contained \ninsufficient detail for any analysis of the professionals' practice.  \n \nA content analysis of the reports was carried out in which the inquiries\u2019 criticisms of professional practice \nwere identified and categorised according to the type of error noted.  A record was also made of the \nprofessionals involved.  A qualitative software programme (Nudist) was used to facilitate data \nmanipulation in terms of counting the frequency of each type of criticism and analysing the contexts in \nwhich they occurred. One limitation of the analysis was that the documents were not prepared specifically \nfor this research project.  They share a common goal of trying to explain why the tragedy occurred but \nthey vary in size from small pamphlets to substantial books.  They, therefore, vary greatly in the amount \nof detail they include and in their coverage of the issues of interest to this research project.  This affects the \nprecision of the analysis.  A report may not, for example, criticise the range of evidence considered by \nprofessionals but this, on its own, does not imply that it was adequate in that case.  It may be that, in a \nbrief report, this was not considered important enough to be mentioned.  Also, when issues were examined \nin detail - for instance, professionals' responses to warnings from neighbours that a child is being abused - \nonly the larger reports gave a sufficiently detailed account of what was done.   \n \nThe practice of social workers received most attention in the inquiries because of their central role in child \nprotection but the contributions of other professionals were covered to varying degrees as many of the key \ndecisions were multi-professional. \n \nFindings \nFindings relating to professionals\u2019 ability to revise their judgements are presented before looking at \nfactors that affect the range and reliability of the information they use in making their risk \n  \n \n7\nassessments. \n \nFailure to revise risk assessments \nAlthough their primary purpose was not to allocate blame, the inquiries made some judgement of whether \nthey considered professional practice to merit criticism.  Media coverage has always highlighted reports \nthat found fault with professionals but, in this review, a slightly different picture of practice emerged.  \nTwenty-five percent of the reports were not critical of anyone; the deaths were considered unpredictable \ngiven the contemporary level of knowledge about child abuse.  Many of these reports applauded the \nquality of practice.  Social workers, who often bear the brunt of critical press reporting, were exonerated \nor, indeed, praised in forty-two percent of the reports. \n \nThe most striking and persistent criticism was that professionals were slow to revise their judgements.  \nThe current risk assessment of a family had a major influence on responses to new evidence. If their initial \nassessment was, in fact, accurate, they demonstrated adequate to good practice.  For example, in one case \n(Cheshire Central Review Committee, 1982), social workers assessed the baby as at high risk but the court \nrejected their application for a care order and so he was returned to his parents.  Social workers then \ndisplayed a high standard of practice in monitoring the family but were unable to obtain sufficient \nevidence to return to court before, sadly, the baby was killed.  In cases where the assessment was \ninaccurate, however, professionals were criticised when there was counter evidence available that the \ninquiries deemed they should have collected and taken note of.  In Jasmine Beckford\u2019s case, for instance, \n(London Borough of Brent, 1985) social workers monitoring Jasmine after she had been returned to her \nabusive parents accepted the parents\u2019 claim that all was well and made no attempt to check this by, for \nexample, seeing Jasmine herself (she lost weight steadily after returning home) or contacting her school \n(her attendance, contrary to her parents\u2019 claims, was erratic).    \n \nThe significance of failure to revise risk assessments became particularly apparent when cases were \n  \n \n8\ngrouped according to the stage at which professionals were involved when the tragedy occurred. In \nfourteen cases, there had been investigation of an allegation of abuse but it was judged to be either \nunsubstantiated or low risk.  In twelve cases, a similar investigation led to the assessment that there was \nmoderate to high risk but insufficient grounds for removing the child and the family were being \nmonitored.  Children who had been abused, removed from their parents and then returned home to them \nmade up a further thirteen cases.  Four families were known to social workers as adoptive or foster \nparents.  The remaining two cases were the Cleveland and Orkney reports where large numbers of \nchildren had been removed from their homes because of suspected sexual abuse.  \n \nTable 1 correlates the level of  professional involvement with whether or not the report was critical. \n \nIn the fourteen cases where allegations of risk or actual abuse had been investigated leading to an \nassessment of no or low risk, criticisms were not directed at the initial assessment but at the failure to \ncheck it more widely or to reappraise it when new evidence arose.  In all the cases, there were repeated \nallegations but later ones were poorly investigated.  Leanne White's social worker, for example, \ninvestigated the first allegations of abuse and decided there were no grounds for concern.  When she \nreceived allegations from two other sets of neighbours, she did not reconsider her judgement but ignored \nthe referrals (Nottinghamshire Area Child Protection Committee, 1994). \n \nThe second group, of cases assessed as moderate to high risk and being monitored, contains the majority \nof the non-critical reports.  Of the four critical reports, it was thought that the assessments of risk should \nhave been higher on the evidence available at the time.  Two early reports blamed the failure on poor \ninterprofessional communication while the two more recent ones blamed it on poor assessment of the \nshared information.   \n \n  \n \n9\nNearly all the cases where the children were returned home were critical. Professionals were, as one would \nexpect, generally optimistic about the parents' improvement but were criticised for a poor standard of \nmonitoring or inadequate investigations of new allegations of concern.  However, in two cases, the courts \nhad sent the children home against the social workers' recommendation.  In these reports, only the court \ndecisions were criticised; the quality of social work monitoring was praised.   In the two cases that were \nnot criticised, professionals were judged to have made competent assessments and it is only with hindsight \nthat we know the family was high risk.  \n \nThe fourth set of cases involved assessments of families as foster or adoptive placements where no \nspecific allegations of abuse were made. The social work assessment was criticised in one case as poor \nand overlooking causes for concern that should have been identified.  In the remaining three cases, \nhowever, it was considered that the risk could not have been seen. \n \nThe final category, involving the large scale removal of children, is very different from the rest of the \nsample in that no child died and it is not clear, even with hindsight, how many were actually the victims of \nsexual abuse.  However, these two reports were included because they illustrate how professionals can be \ncriticised for over-estimating as well as under-estimating risk.  In relation to revising risk assessments, \nboth reports were extremely critical of professionals\u2019 over-confidence in their initial assessments and their \nfailure to review them critically.  \n \nIncidents that triggered revision of risk assessments \nInquiries report that practitioners did, of course, change their minds at times and, in the thirty one cases \nwhere this happened at some point in the history of professional involvement, the incidents that led them \nto revise their assessment of risk substantially were analyzed.  A case may figure in more than one \ncategory but is only counted once within each category.  The findings are shown in Table 2. \n  \n \n10\n \nInjuries were clearly the major factor in reassessing a family.  But, on the whole, only serious injuries \nreported by professionals had this effect. In fifty-eight percent of cases, doctors reported the injuries and \nsaid they believed they were due to abuse.  In twenty-two percent of incidents, the injuries were seen by \nthe social workers themselves.  Nursery staff raised the alarm effectively in three cases.  In contrast, \nneighbours and relatives made numerous reports of injuries but these had little effect on altering \nprofessionals' judgements.  The differential power of professionals and the public is also evidenced in their \nability to trigger what the inquiries judged to be a good investigation of their allegation of abuse.  Ten of \nthe fourteen cases where risk was not seen involved referrals from members of the public.  In the twelve \ncases where investigation of an allegation of abuse led to the assessment that there was a significant risk \nbut insufficient to remove the children, all the referrals came from professionals. \n \nGiven the persistence of the current risk assessment, it is valuable to consider what biases contribute to \ninaccurate assessments and how people can fail to see evidence that challenges their judgement. \n \nAvailable evidence \nSince the inquiries deal only with tragic outcomes, it is known, with hindsight, that the identification of \nabuse and assessment of risk was inaccurate.  A recurrent criticism is that the inaccuracy is due to basing \njudgements on too little information about the family.  Inquiries argue that it is not only with hindsight that \nthe judgement can be faulted but the error could have been rectified if professionals had checked their \nviews against a wider range of evidence. Sometimes, doctors can diagnose abuse confidently from the \nnature of the injuries but, in most cases, recognition and risk assessment involves collating the various \ndetails known to a number of different people.  Each agency\u2019s knowledge may seem only slightly \nworrying when seen in isolation but, once pooled with other agencies\u2019 information, the risk assessment \nmay alter radically.  \n  \n \n11\n \nSo, for instance, the general practitioner knew that Stephen Meurs' mother was seriously depressed, the \nhealth visitor knew that she was not being allowed to see Stephen when she visited but the other children \nlooked alright, and the social worker knew that the grandfather and a neighbour had complained that \nStephen's care was inadequate. Unfortunately this information was not collated until after Stephen's death \nfrom malnutrition (Norfolk County Council, 1975).  \n \nIn examining the range of evidence used, it is useful to distinguish between information that is technically \navailable and that which was actually used by the professionals. \n \nTechnically available information \n One reason for not using the full range of evidence may be that it is technically difficult to obtain. Issues \nof civil liberties, as well as resource constraints, place some limits on how thorough and intrusive \nprofessionals can be.  Some constraints, however, can be due to the systems of communication.  This was \nhighlighted by early inquiries which attributed the failure to collate information to procedural defects - to \nthe absence of formal means of sharing knowledge between professionals. Twelve reports came to the \nconclusion that if all the professionals' knowledge had been shared, the risk to the child might have been \nmore accurately assessed.  These reports occur predominantly before 1979 and the subsequent reduction \nin such criticisms may be a sign of the success of their recommendations.  Clear procedures for \ncollaboration and communication have been introduced (Dept. of Health, 1991b).  Training has \nemphasised the importance of using a wide range of evidence in making assessments and the fallibility of \njudgements made on the basis of seeing a family in only one context, such as a medical surgery. \n \nPsychologically available evidence \nWhile the number of criticisms of interprofessional communication has dropped, there has been no \n  \n \n12\nequivalent drop in criticisms of assessments being based on too narrow a range of evidence.  Information \nhas not only to be shared but to be used.  The major omissions in using evidence that was available are \nlisted below. \n \nPast information was overlooked in several cases. Inquiries paint a picture of professionals becoming \nabsorbed in present-day issues and failing to stand back and place current issues in the long-term history \nof the family.  Sixteen reports (36%) criticise the failure to use past history in assessing current \nfunctioning.  Ten reports (22%) highlight professionals' failure to take a longer-term perspective and \nnotice an emerging pattern of increasing risk. \n \nWhile much evidence from the past was overlooked,  professionals' first impression of a family had \nenduring impact. In fourteen reports, the families were never assessed as dangerous despite repeated \nallegations of abuse.  In eleven of these, the inquiries criticised the social workers, not for their initial \nassessments, but for their failure to review them adequately when given new information. \n \nWritten information was less likely to be noticed than verbal.  In eight cases, social workers failed to look \nat their own files and so overlooked items of major significance such as previous abuse or, in one \nmemorable case, the fact that the child was on the Child Protection register.  At case conferences, \nsignificant evidence in written material was repeatedly overlooked in preference for the direct reports of \nthose present. In the case of Stephanie Fox, those present concluded that there was no evidence of non-\naccidental injury although they had read the paediatrician's report stating that some of Stephanie's injuries \nwere not accidental (Wandsworth Area Child Protection Committee, 1989). Research on child abuse was \nvery under-used. Twenty-five reports (55%) criticise practitioners for failing to recognise the significance \nof known risk factors.  \n \n  \n \n13\nTable 3 summarises the findings on criticisms of the use of evidence. \n \nUnreliable evidence  \nAnother way in which professionals failed to revise their judgements was in their differential levels of \nscepticism about new evidence. Child protection is an area where there is considerable scope for error and \ndishonesty and where a critical attitude to all evidence is needed.  Professionals showed  an ability to be \nsceptical about information when it conflicted with their view of the family but were repeatedly criticised \nfor being uncritical when the new evidence supported their view.  \n. \nChild protection workers often rely on people's testimony rather than written records for information.  \nThey ask parents the cause of their child's injuries.  They ask neighbours to describe the abusive behaviour \nthey claim to have seen. Seniors ask fieldworkers to report on the progress of a case. The problem is that \nthere are many reasons why people lie or distort the facts when talking to a social worker.  Parents who are \nactually harming their child have powerful motives for concealing this. Children who are being abused \ncan be scared to say so. Neighbours and relatives can be malicious and exaggerate or falsify what has \nhappened in order to get the parents into trouble.  Even when not being deliberately dishonest, people tend \nto be biassed in judging what seems significant and worth reporting.  Neighbours who dislike a family \nfind it easier to think of examples of their faults than their virtues.  \n \nInquiry reports show the lengths abusive parents will go to to hide the truth and how successful they can \nbe. Jasmine Beckford's parents went to considerable efforts to stage-manage the social worker's visit to \nhide the fact that Jasmine could not stand properly because she had a broken leg (London Borough of \nBrent, 1985). Each time Sukina was injured, her parents waited for the bruising to fade before taking her \nfor medical treatment so that the fractured bones would not look so obviously due to being beaten up.  \nThey also went to different hospitals to conceal the frequency of her injuries (Bridge Child Care \n  \n \n14\nConsultancy, 1991). When Charlene Salt had broken ribs, her parents told social workers they were going \non holiday and then hid from sight until the injuries were undetectable (Oldham District Review \nCommittee, 1986).  \n \nMany reports criticise social workers for failing to talk to the children concerned and to get their account \nof what was happening.  However, if we examine the ten cases where social workers' communications \nwith children are discussed, it seems that children\u2019s testimony is accepted when it corroborates the social \nworker\u2019s assessment and doubted when it challenges it.  In seven cases, the children denied being abused \nor agreed with their parents' claims that their injuries were due to accidents. In six of these, the inquiries \ndecided, with hindsight, that the children had been lying; in the other case they were uncertain.  In every \ncase, social workers believed what the children said. In the three cases where children said they were \nbeing abused, they were not believed though hindsight shows that they were being truthful.  \n \nThese sources of unreliable information are all, to some extent, familiar to professionals and there are \nmany instances, in the reports, where scepticism was shown and practitioners displayed a good critical \nattitude to evidence.  However, their critical faculties tended to be triggered into action only when the new \ndata conflicted with their existing appraisal of the family. The children who told of abuse and were not \nbelieved all offered information that challenged the current view of the family.  \n \nErrors in communication  \nThe final source of error seems more random but its prevalence suggests it is a significant source of \ninaccuracy. Forty percent of the inquiries reported an error in communication that had serious \nrepercussions on the case because it was not detected.  For example, Heidi Koseda (London Borough of \nHillingdon, 1986) and Stephen Meurs (Norfolk County Council, 1975) both died of starvation but, in each \ncase, social workers' concern about them had been allayed by mistakenly believing they had been seen \n  \n \n15\nalive and well by a health visitor. The health visitor had indeed called at the home but had seen only the \nsiblings.  Accurate information might have led to more urgent efforts to see the children and their poor \nstate of health would have been immediately obvious.  The case of Darryn Clarke illustrates how, as \ninformation moves through a chain of people, small individual distortions finally produce a grossly \ninaccurate message. His relatives went to the police to report their concern that this little boy might be at \nrisk of physical injury from his mother's boyfriend and they were unable to find either the child or his \nmother. The duty senior social worker, at the end of a long chain of communication, heard that a little girl, \nliving with her mother at a specified address, was in danger of neglect.  He visited and, like the relatives, \nfound no-one at home, but, since the case did not sound urgent, he took no further action until the relatives \nagain raised the alarm (DHSS, 1979).  \n \nErrors in communication have been reported in other studies of practice (Vernon and Fruin, 1986) and are \nprobably inevitable. People sometimes hear each other incorrectly; they make mistakes when writing up \ntheir records; they may express themselves in vague terms that leave scope for misinterpretation by others. \nBut the scale of fallibility - with significant errors being reported in 40% of the inquiries - suggests that \nprofessionals need to bear in mind constantly the need to check information and to remember that 'facts' \ncan be inaccurate.   \n \nA non-judgemental acceptance that errors are an inevitable feature of practice might make it easier for \npeople to point out any mistakes they spot.  Corby's study of parental participation in case conferences \nreported that 31% of parents said that factually inaccurate statements had been made about them at \nconferences but they had felt unable to challenge them (Corby, Millar and Young, 1996).  Corby suggests \nthat parents may believe they are more likely to keep their children if they look compliant and correcting \ninformation might be interpreted as being difficult. \n \n \n  \n \n16\nDiscussion \nInquiries are a biased sample of practice since they focus on cases with a tragic outcome.  However, there \nare good grounds for considering them to be representative. Professionals who have read them have \ngenerally accepted them as typical and capable of offering lessons for others. No strong efforts have been \nmade to dismiss them as examples of unusually poor practice. Also, there are other empirical studies of \npractice that corroborate the picture of practice portrayed in the reports (e.g. Social Services Inspectorate, \n1993; Corby, 1996).   \n \nFarmer and Owen's study (1995) supports the findings on professionals\u2019 slowness in revising risk \nassessments.  In a study of one hundred and twenty case conferences, they found that the initial  \nassessment and pattern of case management were not critically re-appraised but  \u2018usually \nendorsed at \nsubsequent reviews, even when it was deficient\u2019 (Farmer and Owen, 1995, p.258).  They cite, \nas illustration, the different reactions to new suspicions of sexual abuse.  In the case of David, \nwhere  \nthere was already significant concern: 'there was an escalation of concern at the [review] \nconference  \nthat was out of proportion to the risks involved' (1995, p.254).  In Jenny's case, where the abused  \nchild had been placed in the supposed safety of a foster placement, her new allegations of being  \nabused by her brother led to no action to separate them or protect the girl.  Farmer and Owen \n(1995) \ncomment:  \nThe escalation in the case of David did seem to relate to a process in which the suspicions of the \ninitial conference were apparently being confirmed, whereas inattention to Jenny's alleged abuse \noccurred because it failed to fit the preconceptions formed at the first conference (p.254). \n \nThis study also supports the findings on what evidence is used.  At case conferences, a focus on the \n  \n \n17\npresent was apparent. Current information gained from the police and social work investigation dominated \nthe conferences (1995, p.141).  The emphasis was not on past history but on giving detailed verbal \naccounts of what had happened at this stage, what family members had said and how they reacted to the \ninvestigation.  Parents' reactions to professionals during the investigation were taken as representative of \nthe quality of parenting normally available to the child, without checking whether they were typical or not. \n \nThe findings of the analysis of inquiry reports accord with psychological research on human reasoning.  \nProfessionals in child protection are not unusual in holding onto views despite contrary evidence.  People \nin general are slow to alter their views: \n It appears that beliefs - from relatively narrow personal impressions to broader social \ntheories - are remarkably resilient in the face of empirical challenges that seem logically \ndevastating (Kahneman et al,1990, p.144). \n \nThe findings on the type of information that was under-used are also what would be expected from \npsychology research. People resort to taking shortcuts because of the sheer volume of relevant material.  \nThe psychologist Kahneman describes the social world as 'often overwhelmingly informative' (Kahneman \net all, 1990). And professionals with heavy caseloads and limited time can easily feel overwhelmed by the \nrange of potentially important details to consider when assessing a family. They tend, therefore, to be \nselective in the information they use but the way they select is biased. They tend to use the facts that come \nmost readily to mind.  The way memory works means that these are not necessarily the most relevant. \nFacts are memorable if they are vivid, concrete,  arouse emotion and are either the first or most recent. \nThis fits the findings of this study: the dull, abstract material in research studies, case records, letters and \nreports was overlooked while the vivid, current information from interviews was remembered. First \nimpressions have enduring effect because they influence the way any new information is interpreted  \n(Munro, 1995).  Hence the social worker who has formed a good opinion of a family is more likely to treat \nany new allegation of abuse with scepticism. In general though, recent events come to mind more readily \nthan past ones and this is illustrated in the way professionals become absorbed in present day issues and \n  \n \n18\nfail to stand back and place current events into a longer term assessment of the family.  This bias can be \nvery powerful in preserving the current risk assessment by obscuring the pattern of behaviour or the \nfrequency with which small worrying incidents are happening. \n \n \nThese findings suggest that one way of improving child protection practice is to devise strategies that \noffset the biases and errors to which human reasoning is vulnerable.  In terms of Hammond\u2019s (1996) \nframework of an analytic\/intuitive continuum, analytic tools are needed to supplement intuitive skills and \nshift practice reasoning along the continuum towards the analytic end. Intuitive understanding often \ncarries with it a strong psychological sense of feeling right so that people tend to be over-confident about \ntheir judgements (Kahneman et al, 1990, Part IV). Because of its fallibility, however, adapting \nHammond\u2019s  example of science, intuitive judgements should be treated as hypotheses that are then tested \nin a more rigorous and systematic way. \n \nIt is unrealistic to suppose that we could eliminate the intuitive element. Risk assessment instruments, for \nexample, can be invaluable aids but they cannot provide a satisfactory replacement for professional \njudgement.  The statistical problems of predicting rare events combined with the limited knowledge of \npredictive factors for abuse mean that any instrument, used in an actuarial manner, will produce an \nunacceptably high level of inaccuracy.  Browne estimated that, on existing knowledge of risk factors, if \nwe screen ten thousand children in the general population, we would miss seven high risk cases, correctly \nidentify thirty-three and falsely identify another one thousand, one hundred and ninety-five families as \nhigh risk. (Browne and Saqi, 1988).  Although the incidence of abuse is much higher among the families \nknown to the protective services, a high level of accuracy is still hard to achieve.  Professionals also face \nthe difficult task of deciding not just whether abuse is probable but whether it is likely to be of a severe \nenough nature to warrant removal of the child.  Current risk instruments do not help predict severity \n(Wald and Woolverton, 1990, p.487). \n  \n \n19\n \nIf it is accepted that intuitive skills have a crucial role, it is important that aids to reasoning should be \nconstructed so that they mesh with intuition and act as a supplementary check rather than be presented as \nrivals, offering an unconnected alternative to intuitive reasoning. \n \nMemory is a key factor in producing bias in the evidence used in making judgements.  Strategies are \nneeded to compensate for the way some data are far more easily retrieved than others. Vivid details, data \nthat are concrete, easily imagined, emotionally charged and recent, spring to mind more readily than the \nby-gone, pallid, abstract, or statistical.  In terms of child protection work, this means past history, written \nrecords, abstract theory and research findings tend to be under-used compared with the current, often \nemotionally charged, factual information gained in interviews. Current strategies to help practitioners \ngenerally involve checklists and guidelines that give equal emphasis to all areas of information.  These \ncould be modified to highlight the areas we know are likely to be overlooked as the ones to which most \ndeliberate attention should be paid.   \n \nGood records are essential in enabling access to the necessary data about the family\u2019s past history \u2013 their \nparenting record, emerging patterns of conduct or significant changes in behaviour. Memory, besides its \nstandard limitations of capacity, is vulnerable to \u2018hindsight error\u2019 or, as Plous (1993, p.35) terms it: \u2018the I-\nknew-it-all-along effect.  This is \u2018the tendency to view what has happened as relatively inevitable and \nobvious \u2013 without realizing that retrospective knowledge of the outcome is influencing one\u2019s judgements\u2019 \n(Plous, 1993, p.35).  \n \nBesides increasing the range of evidence used, another fundamental problem to solve is increasing \npractitioners\u2019 ability to change their minds. One strategy for professionals, proposed by psychologists, is \nto imagine that they are taking the opposing point of view and to think of reasons why their judgement \n  \n \n20\nmight be wrong.  Koriat, Lichtenstein, and Fischoff (1980) undertook a psychological study aimed at \nhelping people reduce their overconfidence in their first judgements and reported this was the most \neffective strategy.  Its success, they suggest, may lie in the way it makes people address their memory in a \ndifferent way.  It does not just ask them to examine the strength of the case for their belief. It entails \nlooking for information to support the opposing view rather than to challenge their existing belief, and so \nharnesses the general tendency to find it easier to think of information that fits a belief than of facts that \nrefute it. The worker who feels the family are pleasant and non-abusive, for example, should consider how \nhe or she could present a case for the view that the children are at risk.  What sources of evidence might be \nworth pursuing? Can any of the existing information be given an alternative interpretation? How reliable \nis the evidence that appears to show the family in a good light? The crucial element in strategies to \ncounteract bias is that they involve considering alternative perspectives (Plous, 1993, p.256). \n \nReviewing judgements critically is a hard task not only intellectually but also emotionally. Practitioners \ndevelop close relationships with their clients. The judgements and decisions in child protection work have \nmajor repercussions on the lives of those involved.  Entertaining the idea that they are seriously misled in \ntheir opinions is stressful. Being critical of one's judgements raises the possibility that the current decisions \nare wrong - a child is, perhaps, being left in a dangerous setting or a family is being broken up \nunnecessarily. This leads to the question of what is the best forum in which to review practice. \n \nAt present, the multi-professional case conference or case review is where most appraisal occurs.  But \nevidence from psychology and from studies on the workings of these conferences agree in finding these to \nbe problematic settings in which to expect constructive criticism to be carried out.  Groups tend to \nconformity.  Janis proposed the concept of 'groupthink' to explain the tendency of groups to avoid \ndissension: 'members' striving for unanimity overrides their motivation to realistically appraise alternative \ncourses of action' (Janis, 1982).  Birchall and Hallett (1995) report wide intra- and inter-professional \ndifferences in assessing vignettes on child abuse yet despite this, conferences display a high level of \n  \n \n21\nconsensus (Farmer and Owen, 1995). Corby's (1987) study found: 'it was rare to observe open conflict at \ncase conferences and most decisions were reached with apparent consensus' (Corby, 1987, p.68).  \n \nCase conferences have important functions in the exchange of information and as a source of strength and \nsecurity for professionals (Hallett and Birchall, 1992) but it may be unrealistic to expect them to provide \nthe setting for critical review. It may be that one-to-one professional supervision is a better context in \nwhich to expect a systematic and critical review of a case.  This can offer a safe, supportive environment \nin which it is clearly understood that making mistakes is an inevitable feature of working in such a \ncomplex area (Munro, 1996).  Changing your mind should be seen as a sign of good practice and of \nstrength not weakness. \n \nConclusion \nAssessing risk and identifying child abuse and neglect are difficult tasks. Errors of any kind have harsh \nconsequences for children and their parents, whether a child is left in a dangerous home or families are \nsplit up unnecessarily. Some mistakes are inevitable because they are due to our limited knowledge.  \nOthers, arising from errors in human reasoning, are avoidable. This analysis of inquiry reports indicates \nthat these errors are not random but predictable on the basis of research in psychology about how people \nsimplify the reasoning processes in making complex judgements.   \n \nErrors can be reduced if people are aware of them and strive consciously to avoid them. The challenge is \nto devise aids to reasoning that recognise the central role of intuition and do not seek to ignore or parallel \nit but, using our understanding of its known weaknesses, offer ways of testing and augmenting it.   \n \nOne weakness of intuitive reasoning is that it tends to be biased in the information it draws on.  It tends to \nbe biased towards that which is vivid, concrete, emotive and either the first or most recent.  Good records \n  \n \n22\nand checklists are essential to reduce this bias but could be more effective if they highlighted the areas that \nprofessionals tend to overlook: the dull, abstract, statistical and old. \n \nThe other prominent weakness of human reasoning is a reluctance to change one\u2019s mind. Professional \njudgements should be regarded as valuable but fallible, needing to be treated as hypotheses requiring \nfurther testing.  This is not an easy step. Sutherland (1992) sums up the research findings on the numerous \nways people have of avoiding challenges to their beliefs: \n First, people consistently avoid exposing themselves to evidence that might disprove \ntheir beliefs.  Second, on receiving evidence against their beliefs, they often refuse to \nbelieve it.  Third, the existence of a belief distorts people's interpretations of new \nevidence in such a way as to make it consistent with the belief.  Fourth, people \nselectively remember items that are in line with their beliefs  (p.151). \n \nGiven the ingenuity of people\u2019s ways of holding on to beliefs, practitioners and their supervisors face \na hard task in developing a more critical attitude.  However, given the importance of accuracy in child \nprotection work in terms of human suffering, it is a challenge that needs to be faced.  \n \nAppendix A     Child Abuse Inquiry Reports \nArea Review Committee, Lambeth, Lewisham and Southwark London Boroughs (1989).
