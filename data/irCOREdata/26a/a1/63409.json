To communicate information, ideas must be aligned \nand molded to fit a shared view of the world. Change can be traumatic and may be \ndeferred until obvious benefits force old ideas to give way to new, and even then \nindividuals only partly reconcile their ideas. The mechanical records of IT must \nreflect the flexibility, overlap, ambiguity, inconsistency, conflict and evolution of \nhuman interpretation. These, and other needs considered in earlier parts of Geoscience \nafter IT, are brought together as a statement of what we want from the system, set out \nas a user requirement. \n \nKey Words - Aligning ideas, paradigms, learning curve, user requirements. \n \n1. Change \n \nThe geoscience record is in constant flux. New ideas and new data are continually \nbeing added, and old ideas and data revised. Conventional methods struggle with \nlimited success to maintain a record which is readily accessible and up to date. If we \nare to find better ways, we need to form a view on how change works. IT must cope, \nnot just with the changes it creates, but also with the diversity of ideas in geoscience \nand their changes through time. \n \n1.1 Flexibility and sharing knowledge \n \nThe information system must be flexible in order to respond to change. For example, \nwords can retain their place in a growing science only because their meaning depends \non the context. Think for instance of the word fault, and the ideas it might bring to the \nmind of field geologists using the concept to explain the outcropping of sediments of \nunexpected age, and possibly searching for landscape features to mark the fault as a \nline on the map. Their views of its characteristics and connotations differ from those \nof, say, the seismic interpreter, the seismologist locating an earthquake epicenter, a \nprospector looking for fault-related minerals, or the structural geologist studying the \nmovement of continental plates. The same word used by a geologist a century ago \nwould carry subtly different implications, embedded in the knowledge and thinking of \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nthe time. The computer engineer, for whom the word has a totally different meaning, \ncould be forgiven for failing to see even a metaphorical connection. A keyword search \nfor documents about faults could be unhelpful. Nevertheless, the ambiguity associated \nwith analogy (part J, section 2.2) gives room for growth and extension of ideas. \n \nInformation gains its meaning from its context. Geoscience information is gathered \nand made available to the information system from a variety of large and small \nprojects (I 8.1). The projects are not devised within the information system, but are \nundertaken for reasons that stem from their business setting, which determines the \nobjectives. The objective may simply be to satisfy curiosity. More likely the studies \nare directed to, for example: the search for oil and mineral wealth or help in its \nexploitation; collecting background information for protection of the environment; \navoiding geological hazards or optimizing land use; or an attempt to understand more \nclearly the processes that formed the earth. The project objectives affect the sampling \nscheme, type of data, data collection method, and operational definitions. The data \ncan be fully understood only through knowledge of the project and the approach used.  \n \nThe development of a model of some sort precedes and is the subject of every \ninvestigation. Data from different projects may use the same terminology but different \nmodels, and thus be misleadingly similar but not fully compatible. This is one reason \nwhy the concept of a database as a pool of shared information (H 3) must be \napproached with care in geoscience. The important relationships among projects may \nbe between models rather than between datasets. It is entirely possible that the models \nmay be implicit rather than explicitly defined, which adds to the difficulties of data \nintegration. Furthermore, a range of alternative models (multiple hypotheses) may be \nconsidered in parallel within a single investigation, as advocated by Chamberlin \n(1897). Yet from a multitude of independent projects there springs a coherent and \nintegrated body of knowledge, as though coordinated by unseen hands. How does this \nhappen, and how will it be affected by changing information technology?  \n \nThe scientific process strongly encourages a shared view of the world. Indeed, a \nprimary purpose of science is to relate a myriad of observations to a few scientific \nlaws. Explanation is the means of integrating numerous concepts and results. \nConformance with accepted procedures is encouraged by peer review, editors and \nreferees, examination boards, textbooks, and standards organizations. Industry may \nencourage standards, for example to make more efficient use of information collected \nduring hydrocarbon exploration. Government, with an interest in royalties and thus in \nthe overall efficiency of the process, may reinforce this with legislation. On its own \naccount, government may play a part by funding surveys of, say, topography, \ngeology, soil science, hydrology, or oceanography. As long-term organizations, \nsurveys tend to develop a uniform house style for investigation and presentation of \ntheir results. \n \nA benefit of a standard approach is that it simplifies the exchange and integration of \ninformation. Object classes and their relationships, which can be defined formally in \ndata analysis, provide a context into which new information can be fitted. Hypotheses \nare erected for further investigation and linked to the current hierarchy of scientific \nlaws. Standards are created by assertion and negotiation; enforced or encouraged by \ncustom, education, agreement, peer pressure and sometimes legislation. They all \ncontribute to a shared frame of reference in which ideas are more readily exchanged, \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \npart of the map for scientific research (K 1.2). Establishing the relationships between \nmodels and harmonizing the underlying concepts is an important theme in the \ngeoscience literature. \n \nThere is, however, a trade-off, that is, some benefits are gained at the expense of \nothers. Collecting data to be widely useful imposes an additional cost on a project, \npossibly unnecessary for the immediate objectives. A standard approach limits \nflexibility, and can lead to an unduly narrow view. Diversity arises from divergent \nobjectives, fragmentation of disciplines, rival or competitive organizations seeking a \nnew niche, research into new possibilities, availability of better or cheaper non-\nstandard methods, and attitudes such as preferring ownership to communication of \ninformation. Diversity is particularly associated with the early experimental phase of a \nnew development. As ideas mature, and a general paradigm gains wide acceptance, \nthe emphasis of the science and the attitude of the scientists change from innovative to \nmethodical. Standards are valued more highly. Exploratory investigations, which are \nknowledge-based and proceed by trial and error, may be supplemented by systematic, \npre-planned rules-based studies. \n \nDiversity also arises from ideas changing with time. Philosophers remind us that we \ncan expect all scientific information ultimately to be wrong. Information repositories, \nsuch as the scientific literature, contain much that we accept, if only because the \nscientific community has so far failed to disprove it. Other information we might \nregard as no longer entirely valid because it conflicts with more recent ideas or new \ndata. However, there are many strands in a complex explanation and in the \nobservations that support it. They involve ideas from many sources at varying levels \nof generality, put together in different ways to explain the same phenomena. The \nPOSC Epicentre Model (POSC, 1997) relates observations to \u201cactivities\u201d, thus \nbringing distinct versions of data, possibly collected at different times with other \ninstruments or objectives, into the same setting. \n \nA study that we regard as based on unacceptable reasoning may contain information \nthat has residual value for unforeseen use in a new context. For example, a borehole \ndescription with unbelievable stratigraphy might yield useful data on lithology. The \nuse of analogy and metaphor introduces an element of ambiguity and flexibility to \nscientific reasoning (J 2.2). By permitting interpretation in several contexts, analogy \noffers the prospect of reworking old material and finding residual value in otherwise \nobsolete information. Its inevitable imprecision helps cross-fertilization where data or \nideas are placed in a new context. It is not surprising, in these circumstances, that a \nlarge part of any project is devoted to the difficult tasks of finding, assessing and \nreinterpreting earlier studies, driven by the need to accommodate change.  \n \n1.2 Paradigms \n \nWe tend to see what we look for, and more strikingly fail to see what we do not look \nfor. Minsky (1981), in his well-known work on machine intelligence and the human-\ncomputer interface, used the concept of frames to describe the intricate context in \nwhich ideas are embedded by the human mind. An idea communicated from one \nindividual to another can be fully understood only if the recipient (man or machine) \nhas an appropriate frame in place to receive it. In other words, the ability to grasp an \nidea depends on what you already know. Data dictionaries (H 3) reflect this concept \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nby defining and placing in context the terms used to record data. Laszlo (1972) made \na broader statement: \u201cThere is no theory without an underlying world view which \ndirects the attention of the scientist. There is no experiment without a hypothesis and \nno science without some expectation as to the nature of its subject matter. The \nunderlying hypotheses guide theory formulation and experimentation, and they are in \nturn specified by the experiments designed to test the theories.\u201d \n  \nObservations are set within a framework of current ideas. Thus the neptunists, \nbelieving all rocks to have been precipitated from a primitive ocean, could not have \nbeen expected to interpret correctly, or even to observe, the features which identify \nSalisbury Crags (I 3) as an igneous sill. During systematic examination of outcrops, \nhowever, unexpected features may be spotted which throw additional light on the \nnature of the rocks. Their significance may derive from analogies with observations \nelsewhere, or like Hutton's unconformity, with present-day processes. In many cases \nthey would not be noticed except by a trained geologist aware of their possible \nsignificance, just as graded bedding, sedimentary structures or trace fossils must \nfrequently have been visible to, but overlooked by, earlier generations of geologists. \n \nKuhn (1962), in his work on The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, distinguishes \nbetween \u201cnormal\u201d science and revolutions in science. Normal science is based on a \nwell-established view of a science in which the practitioners share the same exemplars \nor paradigms. Results are addressed only to professional colleagues, whose \nknowledge of a shared paradigm can be taken for granted, and who prove to be the \nonly ones able to read the papers addressed to them. The paradigm comprises \nuniversally recognized scientific achievements that for a time provide model problems \nand solutions to a community of practitioners. When the individual scientist can take a \nparadigm for granted, he need no longer in his major works attempt to build the field \nanew, starting from first principles and justifying the use of each concept introduced. \nThat, as Kuhn dismissively remarks in his textbook, can be left to the writer of \ntextbooks.   \n \nThe need for experimental work, according to Kuhn, arises from the immense \ndifficulties often encountered in developing points of contact between a theory and \nnature. Observation and experience can and must drastically restrict the range of \nadmissible scientific belief, else there would be no science. But they cannot alone \ndetermine a body of such belief. \u201cThe paradigm provides a map whose details are \nelucidated by mature scientific research. And since nature is too complex and varied \nto be explored at random, that map is as essential as observations and experiment to \nscience's continuing development.\u201d (Kuhn, 1962, page 108) Three classes of problem \n- determination of significant fact, matching of facts with theory, and articulation of \ntheory - constitute the literature of normal science. Research can be seen as a \nstrenuous and devoted attempt to force nature into the conceptual boxes supplied by \nprofessional education. Once the reception of a common paradigm has freed the \nscientific community from the need constantly to re-examine its first principles, the \nmembers of that community can concentrate exclusively upon the subtlest and most \nesoteric of the phenomena that concern it.   \n \nOne strong, but false, impression is likely to follow: that science has reached its \npresent state by a series of individual discoveries and inventions that, when gathered \ntogether, constitute the modern body of technical knowledge, in a process often \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \ncompared to the addition of bricks to a building. That, Kuhn claims, is not the way \nthat science develops. Discovery commences with the awareness of anomaly - nature \nhas somehow violated the paradigm-induced expectations that govern normal science. \n \nKuhn quoted an experiment by two psychologists, Bruner and Postina, who asked \nsubjects to identify playing cards on the basis of a very brief glimpse. The \nexperimenters introduced occasional cards of anomalous color, such as a black 4 of \nhearts. This was identified as the 4 of hearts or sometimes as the 4 of spades. Without \nany awareness of trouble, it was immediately fitted to one of the conceptual categories \nprepared by prior experience. When the brief glimpses were extended to a somewhat \nlonger exposure, however, the subjects suffered acute distress and some broke down \nin confusion. Similarly, the emergence of new theories is generally preceded by a \nperiod of pronounced professional insecurity, generated by persistent failure of the \npuzzles of normal science to come out as they should.  \n \nWhen the profession can no longer evade the anomalies that subvert the existing \ntradition of scientific practice - then begin the extraordinary investigations that lead \nthe profession at last to a new set of commitments, a new basis for the practice of \nscience. A scientific theory is declared invalid only if an alternative candidate is \navailable to take its place. A new theory is always announced together with \napplications to some concrete range of natural phenomena; without them it would not \nbe seen as a candidate for acceptance. It is seldom or never just an increment to what \nis already known.  \u201c... schools guided by different paradigms are always slightly at \ncross-purposes. At times of revolution, the scientist's perception of his environment \nmust be re-educated - in some familiar situations he must learn to see a new gestalt. \nThereafter, the world of his research will seem, here and there, incommensurable with \nthe one he had inhabited before\u201d (Kuhn, 1962, page 111). This intrinsically \nrevolutionary process is seldom completed by a single worker and never overnight. \nKuhn quotes Max Planck: \u201ca new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its \nopponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually \ndie, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\u201d   \n \nKuhn concerns himself largely with development of theory, but claims that the \ndistinction between novelties of fact (discoveries) or novelties of theory (inventions) \nis artificial. He also points out that it may be the endurance of instrumental \ncommitments that, as much as laws and theory, provide scientists with the rules of the \ngame. Computer support, for example, makes possible a systems view of geoscience \nand some reformulation of traditional geoscientific reasoning on a more rigorous \nmathematical basis. Fundamental change to the information system can have far-\nreaching effects on the way science is conducted. \n \n1.3 Dynamics of change \n \nA plausible picture of the development of new technology is the so-called learning \ncurve or S-curve like that of Fig. 1 (compare Coad and Yourdon, 1991). The vertical \naxis represents some measure of the appropriateness, success or value of a new \ndevelopment, say, the automobile, the telephone, or the computer. The first stage of \ninvention and experimentation proceeds slowly until initial successes create interest, \ninvestment and consequent rapid development. Subsequently, as the technology \nmatures, progress is slowed again by the law of diminishing returns. By then, the \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nmain framework of the system is fixed, and change is limited to slow, marginal \nimprovement.   \n \nConsider, for example, the procedures of geological mapping which took shape in the \nearly nineteenth century. An initial phase of discovery and invention was followed by \nexperimental diversity and rapid progress as new methods of representing knowledge \nof spatial characteristics were developed (Rudwick, 1976). This in turn gave way to \nslow, systematic consolidation, building resistance to further change. Mapping \nmethods were refined to the point where enhancements became marginal, and \nconsistency was valued above innovation. Thereafter, newcomers to the craft were \ntrained to follow conscientiously a set of well-established procedures. A blinkered \nview is a positive asset when knowledge-based work gives way to a rules-based \napproach. Fig. 1 suggests desirable qualities in the practitioners at different stages of a \nmaturing technology.   \n \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Learning curve - the development of new technology. Techniques improve \nslowly at first, but initial success leads to investment and rapid growth, curbed \neventually as innovation to a mature system shows diminishing returns. \n \nLargely unheeded by the traditionalists, new supporting technology is set to sweep \naside assumptions on which their hard-won skills were based. Technology tends to \ndisplace existing procedures rather than support an entirely new departure. There are \nat least two distinct S-curves: one showing the development of the older technology, \nthe other the new (see Fig. 2). During its initial development, the newer technology is \nunlikely to be competitive with the old. Not until the new technology has reached the \nstage of rapid growth do many workers in the field see benefit in adopting a new \napproach. Those able to accept new ideas may move ahead, supported by the new \ntechnology. Earlier information may need to be reworked or lost. But skilled workers \nwho were selected for their conscientious dedication to repetitive routine may be \npsychologically unwilling to adjust. There is discomfort and risk in moving from a \nmature technology to a fast-developing one. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n \n \nFig. 2. Crossing of two learning curves. New technology displaces the old when clear \nbenefits appear. \n \nThe information system as a whole is based on technologies that are being \nsystematically superseded by computer-based techniques. Measured by cost-\neffectiveness, the S-curves may already have crossed. But the curves are a gross over-\nsimplification. There is no single paradigm shift. Change occurs at all levels of detail, \nand may have knock-on effects and implications for other levels. There are many \nstrands of information technology applicable to various branches of geoscience. No \nsingle, smooth curve can be examined to see where we stand. \n \nA better analogy might be a mountain which is surrounded by many foothills and \nshrouded in impenetrable fog. The obvious strategy in aiming for the summit is to go \nupwards. But when you apparently reach the top (because every direction leads \ndownhill) you may merely be on one of the lower foothills. A research environment \ncan be much like this, but with many workers throughout the world starting from \ndifferent points and following different routes up the mountain. Despite the fog, \nresearch workers can get an idea of their relative success by shouting to one another, \nor, more conventionally, communicating through conferences and the scientific \nliterature. The individual who has reached a sub-optimal peak and hears shouts from \nabove, can take a bearing and proceed in the direction of the sound. Pushing the \nanalogy a little further, the researcher who is comfortably atop a low foothill might \nconsider carefully before discarding cherished ideas to make a long and dangerous \ntraverse, aiming for a higher foothill which, on arrival, might turn out to have been \nabandoned in its turn. This imposes a degree of stability in the system. For most \nresearch workers, only major benefits justify a change of direction. In these \ncircumstances it is invaluable to gain some idea of the lie of the land.  \n \nInventions and new techniques, as well as new discoveries, can displace earlier \ncommitments despite inevitable resistance to change. Blackmore (1999) used the term \nmemes to describe ideas, skills, habits, stories, songs or inventions that are passed \nfrom person to person by imitation. Taking a meme\u2019s eye view, she suggested how \nmeme\u2019s evolved, meeting the prerequisites of evolution - variation, selection and \nheredity. If the process of science is seen as developing and testing models, then it is \nto be expected that, although the main body of geoscience knowledge is unlikely to be \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \noverturned in the foreseeable future, it will undergo continual amendment. \nHypotheses will be disproved and new ideas emerge. The fittest, as selected by the \nscientific community, will survive.  \n \nWithin their own areas of specialization, scientists may actively seek inconsistencies \nin the paradigm, attempt to disprove proposed explanations and align the model to \ntheir own concepts, thus encouraging diversity and evolution of ideas. Outside their \nspecialism, they are more likely to accept a consensus view. The impact of replacing a \nmodel and the knock-on effects on the remainder of the knowledge base are \ndetermined by the model\u2019s scope and relationships. In geoscience, ideas and methods \nchange at all levels of detail, sometimes with knock-on effects creating minor \nincremental shifts and partial inconsistencies that ripple gradually through the \ninformation system - paradigm drift rather than paradigm shift. \n \n1.4 Reconciling ideas \n \nAll individuals presumably have their own unique view of reality, based on their \npersonality, training and experience. By arranging and classifying the stream of \nsensory experience that impacts on short-term memory, they develop their episodic \nmemory of events and their relationships, and the semantic memory defining their \ncurrent world view (I 4). The ambiguity and inconsistency of human thought make it \npossible for one individual to hold incompletely defined opinions and a selection of \nalternative, possibly incompatible views. This has the advantage that a group of \nindividuals can align their ideas with each other and reconcile their views when \nrequired for the purpose in hand. Their reconciliation probably does not extend far \nbeyond the requirements of that purpose, and may not conform in every detail. But it \nenables you to read and understand this without necessarily believing a word of it.   \n \nCommunication requires a common frame of reference, that is a shared viewpoint or \nset of presuppositions, which can only be developed through education and training. \nThe diversity of ideas and the difficulty of understanding subjects outside one's own \nchosen field suggest that alignment of ideas is incomplete, partial and specific. \nExamples can readily be imagined among the group of students examining the \noutcrop (I 3).  Knowledge (justified true belief) can be seen as the product of a social \nsystem, that is, how people perceive each other and their shared activities. \n \n\u201cNo two people have a perception of reality which is identical in every detail.  In fact, \na given person has different views at different times. . .  But there is considerable \noverlap in all of these views. Views can be reconciled with different degrees of \nsuccess to serve different purposes. By reconciliation, I mean a state in which the \nparties involved have negligible differences in that portion of their world views which \nis relevant to the purpose at hand. . .  . . For the purposes of survival and the conduct \nof our daily lives (relatively narrow purposes), chances of reconciliation are \nnecessarily high. . . But the chances of achieving such a shared view become poorer \nwhen we try to encompass broader purposes, and to involve more people. This is \nprecisely why the question is becoming more relevant today: the thrust of technology \nis to foster interaction among greater numbers of people, and to integrate processes \ninto monoliths serving wider and wider purposes. It is in this environment that \ndiscrepancies in fundamental assumptions will become increasingly evident.\u201d  (Kent, \n1978, p 202-3) \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n \nIt seems that the information system must cope with overlapping information from \ndifferent sources, and with many, possibly contradictory, versions of the same ideas. \nIt must provide mechanisms for retaining ideas in their historical context, and for \nindividual users to sift out their own reasonably consistent working views, without \nlosing sight of the alternatives. It must allow the geoscience community to evaluate, \nselect appropriate models, and build evolving views into their current paradigm. \n \n2. Themes and problems \n \nThe potential benefits of IT determine future directions, and a number of themes \nemerged from earlier chapters. One theme was integration. In conventional systems, \nthe scientist must cope with the separate interface and different content of a book, a \nmap, a discussion group, a seminar, or a field study. Windows on a computer screen \ncan offer a coherent view of the various information types, without undue delays and \nwithout librarians or booksellers. Material can be filtered for relevance to the specific \nuser and displayed appropriately. With matching procedures, the user can edit the \nresult, and add new information as text, images or data, again with few delays in \nmaking the information available and with a reduced need for human intermediaries. \nThe screen on the desktop has many advantages. The map user can select the topics \nfor display, pan to the areas of interest and zoom in or out to the level of detail \nrequired. The reader of text can follow references on the spot, search for keywords, \nand highlight passages for future reference.  \n \nIf the benefits are clear, however, it is also clear why they are for the most part \npotential rather than immediate. The coherence of a well-planned document can be \nlost in a maze of hyperlinks. The accuracy of short-term memory cannot be brought \ninto play when there are long delays in access over the Internet. Information well-\nprinted on paper is more attractive, more convenient to handle, has sharper resolution \nand is easier to read than anything on a screen. For detailed study, therefore, a printed \nversion is desirable. It can of course be prepared on a desktop printer, even copying \nthe original page layout if desired. Full-size maps are more difficult, as specialized \nprinters of large size and high resolution are required to produce a good copy. Having \nselected the appropriate area, scale and topics on the screen, either small extracts can \nbe prepared on a standard printer, or a full-size copy can be prepared by an in-house \nprint shop or by a cartographic bureau. However, if conventional products are to hand, \nthey are likely to be more convenient and of better quality than their new-fangled \nequivalents. \n \nThere are also more crucial problems. In geoscience, digital information for remote \naccess scarcely exists outside the petroleum industry and some large organizations. \nMuch information on the World Wide Web is too ephemeral for bibliographical \nreference, and, for commercial reasons, digital maps are of limited availability. \nGlobalization, in the sense of worldwide exchange of information regardless of \ndiscipline boundaries, promises efficiency gains by reducing redundancy in \ninformation holdings and offering rapid access to comprehensive information \nresources. It depends on widely accepted global standards, but comprehensive \nstandards for geoscience are not in place. There is considerable inertia in the system. \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nAnother theme was that of finding more flexible and rigorous expressions of the \nscientists' conceptual models. Quantitative, statistical and three-dimensional spatial \nmodels were mentioned as more complete and precise representations of scientists\u2019 \nideas. Annotated photographs and video clips, keyed to the model, can help to connect \nthe interpretation with observations. As methods of communication, they all fail if \nusers lack the equipment or skills to receive the message. The full benefits depend on \nthe system as a whole being centered on IT, and therefore are also affected by the \ninertia just mentioned. \n \nThe theme of metadata was seen as important for a number of reasons. To understand \ninformation, you must know how it was collected, and users therefore need access to \nproject metadata. There is also a tendency for different authors to attach slightly \ndifferent meanings to terms used in papers and maps. It could be helpful to users to \nhave metadata with precise definitions of the objects, and indications of where authors \ndeviate from the standard definition. This can be achieved by hypertext links from the \ninformation to the metadata. Hypertext links from well-structured metadata can also \nhelp in searching for relevant material. Starting from the list of topics and \nrelationships in the metadata, it should be possible to trace paths to treatments of these \nideas in the literature. Furthermore, if documents indicate their dependence on earlier \nideas and background theory through hypertext links, then they are positioned on a \nmap of concepts, which could guide readers to relevant papers within their current \nunderstanding. As new ideas are introduced, or old ideas questioned, the links could \nshow the knock-on effects and the ripples of change. Again, however, there is a snag. \nLinks with HTML on the World Wide Web are one-way links to locations, not the \nnecessary two-way and multiple links joining persistent objects. \n \nYet another theme was the evaluation of contributions to the knowledge base. In some \nareas, such as the oil industry or in some geological surveys, the quality of data is \nassessed through rigorous procedures of documentation, checking and evaluation. The \nuser may have more confidence in information coming from a \u2018brand name\u2019 of this \nkind. The editing and refereeing procedures of scientific journals should serve the \nsame function in a broader setting. The relationship of \u2018quality\u2019 to the intellectual \nfoundations of the science is obscure, however. If there really is a set of ideas and \nstudies generally seen as shared exemplars of how things are done in geoscience, \nthere is no obvious mechanism for identifying that paradigm. Presumably individuals \ndevelop their own unique world views from rather fuzzy, overlapping and \ncontradictory ideas. The paradigm appears to be a rather subtle concept, where the \npractitioners feel they know what is what and pass on the knowledge by nods, winks \nand tone of voice. A more explicit means of evaluating ideas would help them to \nevolve efficiently. It should involve the users as well as the providers of information. \nAgain, it can only be part of the wider paradigm shift. \n \nA final theme is the business context, the issue of why geoscientists behave as they \ndo, and what forces drive them. In that sense, business decisions will drive change. \nInertia comes from the huge investment in earlier systems, and the commitment of \nscientists and organizations to existing methods. Many have much to lose and little to \ngain from change. But on the high slopes, vast commercial enterprises are shifting \ntheir ground. Already, IT has brought about local changes throughout geoscience. \nTechnical problems are being overcome. The potential to make money by reducing \ncosts and improving efficiency may have the effect of gravity on a snowfield. When \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nthe avalanche finally starts to accelerate, it is only geoscientists who can determine \nwhether or not the fallout benefits themselves and their science. That seems a good \nreason to list the potential benefits, and consider where we want to go before we \narrive. \n \n3. User requirements \n \nA reference list of desirable IT features in the overall geoscience information system \ncan focus ideas and even serve as an idealized check-list for new systems. It must, \nhowever, be used with caution. Some features are not economic at current prices and \nsome may not be available at all. Features that require long-term availability may \nconflict with rapidly evolving technology (L 6, L 6.3). Others imply a change of \nattitudes which may take many years or may never happen. Most can be provided by \nother means. For example, user training or specialist support can reduce the need for \nuser-friendly systems. Such a decision can have knock-on effects on other aims, \nhowever. For example, if you decide that computer specialists should run the \nprograms, this may rule out interaction between the user and the program. It follows \nthat a broad appreciation of overall developments and their interdependence is needed \nto make good decisions about even a small subsystem.  \n \nIf you draw up a wish list, that is, a list of features you would like to see in your own \nsystem, ask yourself what is practicable and how it can be achieved. If you draw up a \nuser requirement - the basis for a contract with IT specialists to supply specific \nfacilities or services - compare the estimated costs of the system over its lifetime with \nthose of alternative solutions. It is unwise to lead the field where no-one will follow. \nIt is unwise to follow others into a dead end. With these provisos, here, for future \nreference, is an annotated summary of some desirable features in an IT-based \ninformation system. \n \nAide-memoire for a user requirement \n \nThe information system includes recorded information and the processes that \nassemble information and build knowledge. Most geoscience knowledge is held in the \nminds of scientists, who communicate through the user interface with the rest of the \nsystem. Repositories store and manage recorded information for access by the \noriginators and others. Processes manage, manipulate and present the information, \nhelping the user to understand its significance and make decisions. The business \ncontext determines the objectives of geoscience investigations, and the deployment \nand management of resources to achieve them.  \n \n3.1 User interface \n \nMethods of accessing and supplying information should suit the users\u2019 ways of \nworking and be easy to use, accepting and delivering appropriate information as, \nwhen and where required. \n \n1. User-friendliness. A consistent, simple user interface that matches the \nscientist\u2019s way of thinking, including memory levels and modes of thought, \nshould be used throughout. The system should support the specific needs of \nindividual scientists; their joint needs within a workgroup; and communication \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nwith the world at large. The information system should be structured to reflect \nthe processes of building knowledge from information. \n2. Coherence. The interface should be compatible with: other systems in \ngeoscience and other disciplines; the business context; any geoscientific \ninstrumentation that passes data to the system.  It should switch readily \nbetween browsing existing information; adding new information; and editing, \nanalysis, manipulation and presentation. \n3. Control. Originators of information, who best understand its significance and \ntheir procedures, should be able to determine the form and content of their \ncontributions, and make them available without delay. Users, who best \nunderstand their own requirements, should be able to customize the interface \nto select information to meet their own specific needs and determine the form \nof presentation. \n4. Middleware. To maintain a straightforward and familiar user interface, \nmiddleware (L 2) should hide the complexities of distributed systems and \nsoftware such as GIS and DBMS. It should assist access to powerful tools \nsuch as SQL or graphical selection.  \n5. Hypermedia. Hypermedia links should allow different types of information \n(text, spatial, tacit, structured) to be closely associated at all levels of detail, \nboth in collecting the information and presenting it to the user. Within a \nnarrative account it should be possible to embed spatial information and \nquantitative evidence and reasoning, supported by visualization. It should also \nprovide links to experts for advice, and pointers to archived cores, samples and \nspecimens. An interwoven fabric of ideas should be supported through \nlinkages between objects, processes and metadata. \n \n3.2 Repository \n \nThe repository should provide safe, long-term custody of information with ready \naccess to comprehensive, appropriate, current, coherent and testable records. \n \n1. Integration. The repository may be partitioned according to information types, \nseparating, say, documents, GIS and database for efficient management. But \nrecognizing that only a shared framework can make communication possible, \nthe partitions should share well-structured metadata, with models which link \nobjects regardless of where they are stored or how they are represented. \n2. Connectivity. The structure should support complex reasoning, including \nabstraction and generalization, through a network of links and cross-references \namong information in all its forms, including pointers to that held in the users' \nminds. From the palimpsest of overwritten and updated stories, it should be \npossible to extract material filtered by source and topic, and to drill down as \nrequired to detail, to supporting data, or to less popular, conflicting or older \nviews. Dependencies between ideas should be recorded to ensure that change \nat any point can trigger knock-on effects. \n3. Redundancy and reusability. The system should rely on connectivity rather \nthan replication, for efficiency and to minimize confusion when changes are \nmade. Later versions should be able to incorporate parts of the earlier by \nreference rather than repetition. Separation of metadata, objects and processes, \nshould reduce redundancy and  increase reusability. \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n4. Granularity. Microdocuments and markup languages, such as XML (L 6.2), \nshould make it possible to handle narrative information in smaller discrete \nportions (finer granularity). Existing systems for handling spatial and \nstructured data (GIS and DBMS) lend themselves to fine granularity, and can \nthus complement the detail of subdivided text. \n5. Flexibility. It should be possible to identify rival paradigms, versions and \nviews and to discover their different implications. From the same knowledge \nbase, a range of software systems (interpreters) should support such activities \nas training; retrieving observations, interpretations or processes; developing \nideas; and exploring analogies.  \n6. Integrity. The evolving structure must cope with past, present and future \nknowledge. Versions should be frozen on acceptance and retained as \nnecessary for historical reasons, preferably with linkages to show their \nrelationships with the metadata of the time. The system should be able to \nmaintain valid current and historical references while coping with changing \nideas, alternative versions and new information (including knock-on effects). \nLinks should not be left dangling when objects are deleted. \n7. Legacy information. Legacy information should be accommodated in its \noriginal form, together with any updated version where value has been added, \nfor example by digitization and markup. The user should be able to inspect \ncurrent views or views at some previous time and explore the development of \nideas.  \n8. Disposal. A clear disposal policy, which does not compromise the integrity of \nthe system, should be defined and followed for ephemeral and obsolete \nmaterial. Access should not be compromised by changing technology or safe \ncustody by business priorities. \n9. Context and framework. Project objectives and design features that assist \ninterpretation and evaluation should be recorded. A document should be put in \ncontext by indicating the standards followed, together with a note of any \ndivergence, or else carry a full data description. It should be possible to \nidentify the background theory and previous work on which a document \ndepends. These indicate the knowledge required to understand it, and thus its \ncomprehensibility for a particular user. Information assembled by information \ncommunities and editorial boards (M 2) should provide coherent frameworks \nthat strengthen the structure of the knowledge base as a whole. \n10. Metadata. Standards, and the metadata in the computer repository, are \nanalogous to human semantic memory. They create guidelines for organizing \nthe information, and are essential for retrieval and coordination. Widely \naccepted standards should be followed, so that information can be more \nreadily and more widely shared to greater effect. Metadata should reflect the \nideas of the geoscience community as a whole, appropriately controlled \nthrough committees that consult widely (L 5, L 6.1). \n11. Evaluation. The results of evaluation should be generally available, supported \nby techniques such as quality assessment and branding. It should be possible \nto record different evaluations, and thus reflect changing opinions. Although \nolder ideas should be retained, it is the fittest ideas that should survive and be \nthe most obvious and accessible to the user. \n \n \n \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \n3.3 Processes \n \nComprehensive procedures should be available for acquisition, storage, processing, \ndelivery and presentation of information. \n \n1. Search techniques. The system should simplify the process of identifying and \nreaching all recorded information relevant to the individual's needs, by \norganizing material within a clear browsable structure, and by offering \ncomprehensive search procedures with indexes, summaries, keywords, spatial \nsearch, structured query language, and hyperlinks. \n2. Interaction. The advantages of the computer\u2019s precise rules-based activities \nand the user\u2019s fuzzy but extensive background knowledge should be combined \nin interactive processing. \n3. Analogies. Explanation by analogy relies on the human mind, with its \nbackground knowledge and capacity for inference and intuition. A lengthy \nlearning process is involved, imprecision and ambiguity being the price of \nflexibility of thought. The computer should help the scientist to detect and \nexplore a wide range of analogous situations under interactive control.  \n4. Reconciliation. The system should respond to the opinions and views of \nindividual users, recognizing that these overlap extensively but seldom \ncoincide. It should support negotiation to align and reconcile (but not \nobliterate) alternative versions. \n5. Representation. Computer systems should make it possible to express \nconceptual models more fully, tied more clearly to the evidence on which they \nare based, in a form shared by the geoscience community as a whole. They \nshould provide effective representation of geoscience knowledge through \ncomputer-based models and processes, such as visualization and statistical and \nspatial models. \n6. Tacit knowledge. Processes should be available to communicate tacit \nknowledge by showing the learner how to do things by example, \ndemonstration and practice. For example, annotated photographs and video \nclips can help to show the procedures and locations of observation at an \noutcrop, allowing the reader to repeat the original procedures, and confirm the \nresults or otherwise. \n7. Abstraction. Information should be available at different levels of detail or \nabstraction. Where possible, the process of abstraction should be automated, \nbut in many cases will require human judgment and intervention. Standard \nlevels of detail should be available to simplify comparison and integration \nwith other datasets, as is current practice with maps at standard scales. \n \n3.4 Business aspects \n \nThe geoscience information system should be relevant, profitable, and efficient in \nmeeting the business needs. The business context of a project is relevant to the \nscientific interpretation and should be recorded. \n \n1. Reduced costs. The need for paper publications and their management in \nnumerous libraries should be reduced through client\/server communication. \n2. Disintermediation. Dependence on intermediaries and consequent delays \nshould be reduced by computer support for word, data and image processing, \nLoudon, T.V., 2000. Geoscience after IT: Part K (postprint, Computers & Geosciences, 26(3A)) \n \nand for search and retrieval. The complex tasks of managing a store of \nscientific information should be eased by computer support and indexing.  \n3. Delayering. A directed flow of business and scientific information should \nsupport better decisions, simpler management structures and more efficient \nworking. By making relevant information available to all concerned, \nconclusions should be reached more rapidly, layers of management can be \neliminated, and groups and individuals empowered to make decisions within \nthe constraints of the system.  \n4. Project management. The information system should be brought closer to \nbusiness requirements by linking it to project management and control. Project \nmanagement and business aspects should be closely linked to the scientific \nsystem, as they bear on the planning and execution of each investigation. \nDescriptions of past, present and proposed projects should be available to help \nusers to interpret the results and be aware of current developments. Within an \norganization, the information system strategy should be incorporated into the \nbroader business plan. \n5. Standards. The system should discourage unnecessary barriers to \ncommunication by recognizing the value added through compatibility and \nadherence to standards. \n6. Outsourcing. It should be possible to delegate some activities, such as \ninformation management, to a specialist organization. Assessment for quality, \nincluding adherence to standards, should ensure an efficient service to many \nusers. \n7. Intellectual property rights. The reward system relies on intellectual property \nrights, which should be protected. Access should be controlled if necessary by \nentitlement indexes and encryption. \n8. Incentives. Participants should be motivated to drive forward all aspects of the \nsystem in a coordinated manner, by appropriate incentives and giving credit \nwhere it is due. Charging systems should be implemented where appropriate. \n \n4. References \n \nBlackmore, S., 1999. The Meme Machine. Oxford University Press, New York, \n264pp. \n \nChamberlin, T.C., 1897.
