In particular, it examines attitudes to teaching music, factors affecting\nteachers\u2019 confidence, the relationship between confidence and training, support for music\nteaching, teaching experience and musical background. The non-specialist teachers taking\npart in this survey were chosen from twelve schools across one Local Education Authority\n(LEA). The attitudes and views on teaching music of 71 teachers were obtained through a\nquestionnaire survey and follow-up interviews. The findings of this survey show that there\nis much work still to be done in providing non-specialists with effective long-term training\nand support to increase their music skills, subject knowledge, and confidence, to enable\nthem to make a more marked difference to children\u2019s musical education.\nI n t r o d u c t i o n\nSince the introduction of the Education Reform Act (1988) and the National Curriculum\nin the UK, it is now expected that all children in England and Wales will be taught\nmusic by their class teacher or a music specialist. This statutory requirement has placed\nenormous demands upon teachers, many of whom were initially trained as generalists.\nThese generalist teachers are now required to teach music to specific levels which demand\nskills of a very high order, irrespective of their inadequate training in music and lack of\nconfidence. Furthermore, societal expectations today demand that a teacher\u2019s classroom\npractice, in all subject areas of the National Curriculum, is now publicly verifiable (Carre,\n1993). This public accountability led to concerns about the state of music in English and\nWelsh primary schools. These concerns brought into focus an on-going debate which first\nemerged in the early 1980s, of whether or not music should be taught by a specialist\n(music co-ordinator) or non-specialist (the class teacher with little or no musical skills). A\nrange of views have been presented, all seeking to determine the relative importance of\nthe specialist or non-specialist in teaching music at primary level.\nHowever, since the introduction of the National Curriculum for Music, OFSTED (Office\nfor Standards in Education) have argued that, as with other subjects, the development of\nprimary music largely depends on the \u2018level of expertise and quality of teaching available\u2019\n(OFSTED, 1995: 17). More recently, it has been accepted that there are not enough music\nspecialists in primary schools today, capable of providing a high quality music education\n(DFEE, 1998; Milliband, 2004). Consequently, the role of the non-specialist is crucial,\n23\nH i l a r y Ho l den and S tua r t B u t t on\nand the question remains \u2013 is it reasonable to expect the non-specialist teacher to teach\nmusic given its specific subject status? Does the non-specialist teacher have the subject\nknowledge, confidence and expertise to develop and promote music to the \u2018high standard\u2019\nrequired by the National Curriculum?\nThese questions have relevance for the new primary strategy, Excellence and Enjoyment\n(2003), a report designed to develop programmes for modern foreign languages, physical\neducation, music, the arts and information and communication technology (ICT), develop\nschools\u2019 and teachers\u2019 own professional ability, and develop assessment for learning.\nThis document places more emphasis on these foundation subjects and, in particular,\nthe development of children\u2019s self-esteem, motivation, achievement, life skills, and the\nfostering of the individual\u2019s talent through creativity (DfEE, 2003: 31). These questions\nare also significant to the musical development of all children and relevant to school\norganisation.\nTo appreciate the on-going debate of music specialist versus non-specialist and to\nplace the current research in context, it is important to consider the research evidence and\nreports that have accumulated on this subject over the last 25 years.\nH i s t o r i c a l c o n t e x t\nThe first reference to support fully some form of curriculum co-ordination by a specialist\nteacher was the Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate (HMI) survey Primary Education in England\n(DES, 1978). This survey reported a high correlation between standards at primary level\nand the effective use of the curriculum co-ordinator, noting that this effectiveness depends\non both the strengths of the co-ordinator and receptiveness to suggestions and change by\nstaff. At the same time, the report accepted that the class teacher was perhaps in a better\nposition to ensure that the curriculum \u2018matched\u2019 each child\u2019s intellectual ability (Allen,\n1988: 217). As a result of this publication, the idea of the curriculum co-ordinator began\nto gain momentum, as a series of reports and recommendations ensued: the Gulbenkian\nReport (1982), Education 5\u20139 (DES, 1982) and 9\u201313 Middle Schools (DES, 1983). These\nreports all recommended that curriculum specialist teachers should be appointed and these\nspecialists should share their expertise and knowledge with their colleagues. Moreover,\nthey acknowledged that few teachers could be expected to be an expert in all areas of the\ncurriculum.\nThese views were further reinforced by a number of government initiatives: the Primary\nSchools Research and Development Group (1983), the Education 8\u201312: Combined and\nMiddle Schools Report (DES, 1985), the Curriculum 5\u201316: Curriculum Matters (DES, 1985),\nBetter Schools (DES, 1985) and the Inner London Education Authority\u2019s survey Improving\nPrimary Schools (ILEA, 1985), and culminated in Curriculum Matters 4: Music From 5\u201316\n(DES, 1985). This latter document emphasised the importance of practical music activities\nand recommended specialised music teaching from the age of eight by the class teacher or\nwith the support of the music co-ordinator.\nAlexander et al. (1992) argued that it was the introduction of the National Curriculum\nthat brought the question of subject expertise to the fore, and that primary teachers now\nfaced \u2018a demand which may well be unreasonable and unrealistic, as with the broadening\n24\nThe teach i ng o f mus i c i n t he p r ima r y s choo l b y t he non-mus i c spec i a l i s t\ncurriculum, many teachers may compromise the quality of teaching in order to cope with\nthe quantity\u2019 (p. 42). At the same time, Alexander et al. also recommended that the existing\nrole of class teacher and consultant be strengthened by introducing semi-specialist and\nspecialist teaching to primary schools and suggested concentrating specialist teaching at\nthe upper end of Key Stage 2 (p. 42).\nAfter the introduction of the National Curriculum a number of reports and reviews\nwere instigated by the Department for Education and Science, including Music for Ages\n5\u201314 (1991), in which it was noted that schools without a teacher with sufficient expertise\nin music to give curriculum leadership had difficulty in teaching an appropriate range\nof musical activities consistently. Music was more often taught by specialist teachers at\nprimary level than any other subject, and where such teaching was well planned and\nmanaged, it was found to result in high standards of musical work. HMI also observed that\nthe presence of a specialist teacher, whether or not they are mainly employed in specialist\nteaching, is usually associated with good quality work in music. But the report accepted\nthat support was necessary, noting that \u2018the availability of a teacher with expertise in music\nto help those colleagues who are less skilled . . . is a crucial factor in achieving success\u2019\n(p. 27).\nSimilarly, the HMI report, Key Stages 1 and 2 of the National Curriculum (1995),\ncommented that while standards of music were uniformly high, the highest standards\nwere often found \u2018in lessons taught jointly by a music specialist and the class teacher, or\nwhen teachers who work for part of the time as music specialists taught their own class\u2019\n(p. 18). Furthermore, the report acknowledged the mismatch between the subject matter to\nbe taught and the teacher\u2019s subject knowledge.\nConsequently, after the implementation of the National Curriculum, three different\nviews emerged with regard to the teaching of music in the primary school:\n(1) Schools should have a music co-ordinator\/consultant on the staff to teach music to\neach class;\n(2) Music education should be the responsibility of the generalist class teacher;\n(3) Music co-ordinators should support the class teacher.\nArguments supporting each of these views can be found in the research literature. Tillman\n(1998) and Glover and Ward (1993) suggested that music should be taught by a single class\nteacher, arguing that the teacher\u2019s own skills, as well as their general teaching ability, can be\n\u2018sufficient to enable children to learn\u2019 (Glover & Ward, 1993: 17) Similarly, Davies (1994),\nobserving the way children can assimilate musical concepts without formal teaching at a\nvery young age, claimed that the necessary demands could be met by the non-specialist\nteacher. The research which supports this point is Moog\u2019s study of The Musical Experiences\nof the Pre-School Child (1968). He concluded that musical ability is not special, but is\nacquired like \u2018understanding speech\u2019; in other words, musicality is the application of the\nteacher\u2019s general ability. However, Plummeridge claims that a non-specialist teacher would\nbe better advised to improve their own musical ability as a \u2018pre-requisite to music teaching\u2019\n(Plummeridge, 1991: 89).\nMills (1989: 126) makes the important point that music taught by the class teacher\nhelps children to appreciate music as part of the whole curriculum, and enables greater\nopportunities to be provided for music. Mills also stresses the importance of the teacher\u2019s\n25\nH i l a r y Ho l den and S tua r t B u t t on\nknowledge of individual children, so they can observe the children\u2019s musical development,\nascertain their capabilities, and plan with this in mind. Additionally, Mills believes that\n\u2018music is for all children\u2019 and as such, should be taught \u2018by all teachers\u2019. This can be\nachieved, she argues, given appropriate preparation and support. Mills promotes this view\nin order to eschew music becoming something separatist and elitist; a view shared by\nGlover and Ward (1993), Hennessy (1994), Struthers (1994) and Stocks (1998).\nHowever, Lawson et al. (1994) express concern that \u2018there may be insufficient teachers\nin primary schools with the necessary confidence and expertise to implement fully the\nmusic programme\u2019 (p. 3). They also point out the need for different teaching roles, suggesting\nthose of musical model, music critic and curriculum developer. Lawson et al. argue that\nin order to function in these roles, primary teachers of music need a sound basis of both\nmusical experience and teaching expertise (p. 8). Similarly, Rainbow (1996) argued that\nthe acquisition of techniques such as singing and aural perception are essential before\nintroducing them to children (p. 10).\nGlover and Ward (1993) take a different view. They argue that music is an important\npart of life both at a personal level and from an educational point of view. As we use music in\neveryday life for various purposes such as dancing and relaxation, they suggest, we all hear\nand respond to structures in music even if not trained to do so. Glover and Ward believe\nall trained teachers possess the ability to teach basic musical skills to all children, but\nthey do concede that a lack of training in music education may lower the non-specialists\u2019\nconfidence. They suggest that although everyone has the capacity to achieve in music,\nnon-specialists may see unrealistic aims as the ideal, fostering the view that music is a\nsubject to be taught by specialists. Hennessy (2000) argues that this is a deeply entrenched\nview as many teachers believe that music requires \u2018gifts that are only attainable by, or given\nto, a chosen few\u2019 (pp. 183\u2013184).\nLikewise, Binns (1994: 2) and Flash (1993: 67) believe that every teacher can teach\nmusic, and note that while assistance from a specialist is useful, teachers should not be\ninhibited by the absence of this support. Suzuki (1969) endorsed this viewpoint. He relates\nthe learning of violin playing to language acquisition, stating that any teacher can become\ncomfortable with music as with handwriting or basic numeracy (p. 14). Furthermore,\nGilbert (1981) avers that just as teachers can teach art by developing their skills, teachers\ncan similarly provide interesting and varied musical activities (p. 6), but adds that the\nshortage of a good music specialist can result in music being neglected in some schools,\na consequence of underfunding (Hennessy, 2000). Stocks (1998) concurs, accepting that\nthe number of primary music specialists is limited, but if non-specialists are helped to find\nconfidence through in-service training, have appropriate access to resources, are provided\nwith professional in-class support then music can be taught effectively by the non-specialist.\nMoreover, support from the music specialist would allow enhanced opportunities for the\nprofessional development of the class teacher (Allen, 1989: 144).\nThese different views are important as they have implications, not only for schools,\nbut for Initial Teacher Training Institutions since the introduction of the Teacher Training\nNational Curricula in England and Wales (DfEE, 1998). This document sets out a number\nof statutory requirements that must be met before entering the teaching profession: an\nessential core of knowledge, understanding and skills which include effective teaching\nand assessment methods, pedagogical content knowledge and understanding, and\n26\nThe teach i ng o f mus i c i n t he p r ima r y s choo l b y t he non-mus i c spec i a l i s t\nsubject knowledge and understanding, if standards in teaching are to be raised (Parker,\n2000: 89).\nAgainst this background, the following study was instigated to provide a useful update,\nat the mid-decade point, on the views of non-specialist music teachers, in order to ascertain\nif it is realistic to expect them to teach music and meet quality assurance standards. In so\ndoing, it provides insight into a group of qualified teachers\u2019 perspectives on their ability to\nteach music. It also attempts to identify those issues, other than music knowledge, which\nmay influence non-specialist teachers\u2019 reluctance to teach music.\nMe t h od\nThe research focuses on non-specialist teachers\u2019 levels of confidence in teaching music,\ntheir musical training and their qualifications. It considers non-specialist teachers\u2019 attitudes\ntowards music and the development of their musical pedagogy. These areas are explored\nthrough two research questions:\n(1) To what extent do non-specialist teachers feel able to teach music to children?\n(i) Is there a correlation between confidence and musical experience and training?\n(ii) Is there a correlation between confidence and key stage taught?\n(2) What support do non-specialist teachers receive in music?\nThe non-probability sample was chosen from the teaching population of one Local\nEducation Authority (LEA). Twelve schools were included in the sample and all class\nteachers within these schools (141 teachers) were asked to complete a questionnaire. In\naddition, 23% of these teachers (16 teachers) were asked to take part in a semi-structured\ninterview.\nResea r ch i n s t r u m en t s\nThe combination of quantitative and qualitative data was thought to best address the\nresearch questions. The questionnaire was limited to six main questions and these focused\non:\n(1) confidence in music teaching;\n(2) support for music teaching;\n(3) training;\n(4) teaching experience;\n(5) musical background;\n(6) attitude towards music.\nThe responses were indicated by ticking boxes or rating by a numbering system. The\nquestionnaire was piloted by four teachers from one school in the same LEA in order to\nmaximise reliability. A small number of minor amendments were made to the questionnaire\nafter the pilot. A total of 141 questionnaires were then distributed to class teachers. Seventy-\none of the questionnaires were returned, giving a response rate of 50%. The questionnaires\n27\nH i l a r y Ho l den and S tua r t B u t t on\nhad been coded in order to identify the response rate from each school and no school had\na 100% response rate.\nThe sem i - s t r uc t u r ed i n t e r v i ew\nAt the end of the questionnaire a paragraph was added asking if respondents would be\nprepared to be interviewed. Sixteen class teachers, 23% of the survey sample, agreed to be\ninterviewed. The questions were grouped into the same six sections as for the questionnaire\nabove. The interview schedule was introduced by a preamble which included prompts and\nprobes designed to guarantee consistency of treatment across the series of interviews.\nThe responses to questions were written down by the interviewer and then read back to\nthe interviewee in order to verify the information recorded and give the respondent the\nopportunity to expand on their answer. The purpose of the interviews was firstly to expand\nupon information provided by the questionnaire, by investigating respondents\u2019 motives and\nfeelings more fully, and secondly to maximise reliability and validity of the study.\nAna l y s i s : s umma r y o f r e s u l t s\nThe initial analysis of data involved an examination of the questionnaire responses which\nwas done in three stages. First, all the responses from all class teachers were counted for\neach question. Second, responses from Key Stage 1 (ages 4\u20137) and Key Stage 2 (ages 7\u2013\n11) teachers were compared. Third, the questionnaires were analysed for evidence\nof correlation between responses to two questions, through the use of a chi-squared\nsignificance test. In applying this test, the following precautions were observed: categories\nused in the contingency table were mutually exclusive and exhaustive. However, non-\nresponses have not been used, and totals amended accordingly; the sum of each column\nhas been checked in each case to ensure that it equals the number of cases in the study\n(after non-responses have been removed); if an expected value was below 5, categories\nwere combined as appropriate to give sufficiently large classes of data. (Where the number\nof independent variables is 1, Yates\u2019 correction for continuity has been applied to decrease\nthe error caused by the grouping.)\nBackg round i n f o rma t i on on responden t s\nThe sample was shown to include teachers with a range of teaching experience (Table 1).\nThe responses of teachers from different key stages and with different lengths of\nteaching experience are examined at a later stage in order to identify any notable differences\nin their responses to the questions.\nTable 1 Teaching experience\nNumber of years teaching experience 0\u20135 6\u201310 11\u201315 16\u201320 21 or more\nNumber of respondents 19 19 11 7 15\nPercentage 27% 27% 15% 10% 21%\n28\nThe teach i ng o f mus i c i n t he p r ima r y s choo l b y t he non-mus i c spec i a l i s t\nOf the 71 respondents, 54 were responsible for one or more subject areas, and of these\nseven were responsible for music. Sixty-six teachers (93% of the sample), taught music to\ntheir own class. In addition, 11 had a colleague, a co-ordinator or a specialist to teach\nmusic for them, although two specified that this was for small group instrumental teaching\nrather than class music lessons. This raises the interesting point that an instrumental lesson\nmay be seen by some to take the place of a class lesson. The remaining five respondents\n(7% of the sample) had music taught to their class by an external music specialist. However\nof these five, four indicated by their responses to other questions that they did in fact teach\nsome music themselves. To summarise, only one teacher from a sample of 71 taught no\nmusic.\nConfidence o f t he non-mus i c s pec i a l i s t\nRespondents were asked to rank the ten National Curriculum subjects on a scale of one\nto ten, one indicating that they felt most confident to teach a subject, through to ten\nindicating that a subject was the one they felt least confident to teach. On this scale music\nwas given the lowest ranking of confidence; an average of 7.35%. When interviewed about\ntheir confidence in teaching music there was a lot of uncertainty about the subject. Not\nbeing able to read music made respondents feel very vulnerable. They viewed music as\na \u2018specialist area\u2019 unlike other subjects. Other key factors which could explain the low\nranking of music on the confidence scale were mentioned during interview: a lack of\nmusical knowledge, time and teaching environment, resources and age group taught. In a\ncomparison of the responses to this latter point, the survey showed, generally speaking, a\nhigher proportion of KS2 teachers felt less confident in teaching music (38%) than those\nin KS1 (33%). Although this does show a higher proportion of KS2 teachers who are not\nconfident in teaching music and a higher proportion of KS1 who are reasonably confident,\nthe difference was not found to be a significant one when statistically tested.\nMus i ca l e xpe r i ence and t r a i n i ng\nIn response to the question on musical training, 69% of the sample surveyed had received\nsome musical education as part of their initial teacher training. Although the content of\nmusic courses in initial teacher training was not investigated, it was noted that a higher\nproportion of more recent entrants to the profession have received initial teacher training\nin music than those teachers who had been teaching for more than 21 years or more.\nThese responses were examined further to determine whether any correlation existed\nbetween initial teacher training in music and level of confidence to teach it. A chi-squared\ntest was applied to these data and the calculations show a significant link between these\ntwo points (p = 0.04).\nAs it had been noted that more recent entrants to teaching were more likely to have\nreceived initial training in music, and that those who received this training were more likely\nto feel confident to teach music, it was important to investigate any possible link between\nconfidence and number of years\u2019 teaching experience (Table 2).\nWhen the chi-squared test was applied to these data, a marginally significant link\n(p = 0.18) between number of years teaching experience in primary schools and level of\n29\nH i l a r y Ho l den and S tua r t B u t t on\nTable 2 Confidence, by experience\nNumber of years teaching in primary schools\nLevel of confidence 0\u20135 6\u201310 11\u201315 16\u201320 21 or more\nVery confident 4 (21%) 1 (5%) 1 (9%) 2(29%) 1(7%)\nReasonably confident 10 (53%) 13 (68%) 4 (36%) 1 (14%) 7 (47%)\nNot confident 4 (21%) 5 (26%) 6 (55%) 3 (43%) 7 (47%)\nNo response 1 (5%) 0 0 1(14%) 0\nTotal 19 19 11 7 15\nconfidence was discovered, suggesting that a higher proportion of more recent entrants to\nthe profession felt confident to teach music.\nIn response to the question on musical qualifications, 75% had none, 20% had up to\nand including grade five Associated Board practical\/theory and\/or GCSE in music. None\nhad qualifications in grades 6\u20138 and or A level music, 2% had a degree in music and 3% did\nnot respond. These responses were examined further to determine whether there was any\ncorrelation between musical qualifications (musical knowledge) and level of confidence\nto teach. Responses from teachers with no musical qualifications were compared with\nresponses from teachers who did have qualifications in music (Table 3).\nTable 3 Confidence, by qualifications\nNo qualifications in music Qualifications in music No response\nVery confident 1 7 1\nReasonably confident 23 12 0\nNot confident 23 1 1\nNo response 1 1 0\nA chi-squared test was applied to these data and a significant link (p = 0.010) was\nfound between musical qualifications and confidence to teach music.\nTeache r s \u2019 a t t i t udes t o wa rds mus i c\nThis section of the questionnaire concentrated on whether teachers participated in musical\nactivities, and whether they were able to promote music as an enjoyable subject.\nRespondents were asked to indicate if they participated in music by ticking one of the\nfollowing: none, listen to music, sing, sing in a choir, play an instrument, play with a\ngroup\/band\/orchestra, or any other activity. For the purpose of data analysis and application\nof statistical procedures, respondents were divided into discrete categories: those who did\nnot participate, those who listened to music but did not participate, those who listened\nto music but did participate in any other way, those who played an instrument and or\nsang, without indicating listening to music and those who listened to music in addition\nto playing an instrument or singing. These were then divided into categories of \u2018low\u2019 and\n\u2018high\u2019 participation. The total of low participation was 37 and the high 38. These data\n30\nThe teach i ng o f mus i c i n t he p r ima r y s choo l b y t he non-mus i c spec i a l i s t\nwere then examined in relation to the level of confidence respondents felt to teach music\n(Table 4).\nTable 4 Confidence, by participation in musical activities\nLow activities High activities\nVery confident 0 9\nReasonably confident 17 18\nNot confident 19 6\nNo response 1 1\nA chi-squared test was then applied to these data to determine whether musical\nactivities and level of confidence were independent variables, or whether there was a\nsignificant link between the two sets of numerical data. A connection between the responses\nto each question was found to be highly significant (p = 0.010).\nWith regard to the question on whether respondents were able to promote music\nas an enjoyable subject, 77% said yes, 20% said no, and 3% did not respond. Further\nlinks between participating in musical activities, and feeling able to promote music were\nexamined, but no significant link was discovered.\nSuppo r t i n mus i c t each i ng\nIn this part of the questionnaire respondents were asked about the forms of support they\nreceived in music teaching and whether the support received enabled them to teach music\nindependently. They were then asked what kind of support they would like to receive.\nThere were some multiple responses to this question, as teachers often used more than one\nform of support in their teaching (Table 5).\nTable 5 Forms of support used or received by respondents\nForm of support Non-specialists\nText books and teacher guides 30 (47%)\nSchool scheme of work 40 (63%)\nRespondent\u2019s own knowledge and ideas 20 (31%)\nA published music scheme 44 (69%)\nSupport in own classroom by a music specialist 6 (9%)\nIn-service training (INSET) in music 22 (34%)\nAdvice\/assistance in planning from music coordinator 18 (28%)\nTelevision programmes and radio broadcasts 12 (19%)\nNone of the above 0\nNo response 3\nAlthough the categories stating forms of support are not mutually exclusive, direct\ncomparisons can be made between percentages linked to KS1and KS2. Respondents in\n31\nH i l a r y Ho l den and S tua r t B u t t on\nKS2 indicated a higher usage of all forms of support with the exception of INSET and use\nof own knowledge and ideas. The response to the latter from KS1 teachers indicates that\ntwice as many of them felt more able to use their own knowledge and ideas to support\ntheir music teaching than KS2 teachers.\nResponses from interviewees give some insight into the forms of support found most\nvaluable by teachers. Where in-class support from music specialists was received, it was\ngenerally found very helpful. Non-specialists were attracted to music schemes because\nthey liked the support of the tape when teaching singing and they felt the scheme gave\nthem some direction. But they preferred simple schemes or teaching packs with learning\noutcomes for each year group; schemes that were teacher- and child-friendly, and that\nprovided time-saving activities.\nTe a ch i n g d i f f e r e n t a s p e c t s o f mus i c\nThis section was designed to investigate whether teachers felt more confident teaching\nsome aspects of music than others, and the areas they taught most often. When asked\nhow frequently respondents sang songs with their class, 9 responded every day, 17 more\nthan one each week, 18 once each week, 16 very rarely and 4 never. The interview data\nrevealed the inadequacy a number of respondents felt in teaching singing. Some found it\ndifficult to sing in tune, others felt frustrated at not being able to sing well and a number\nfelt very insecure when teaching older children.\nWhen responses from KS1and KS2 were compared, it was noted that KS1 teachers sang\nmore frequently than those in KS2. A chi-squared test was applied to determine whether a\nsignificant relationship existed between the two sets of variables, and this was confirmed\nat the 1% level of significance (p = 0.010).\nIn respect to respondents being asked if they taught one area of music more often than\nothers (singing, rhythm, listening, exploration of instruments notation and composition)\n46% responded \u2018yes\u2019 and 17% said no, with 1% no response. Singing was the aspect\ntaught most frequently, followed by rhythm and listening. We found this surprising given\nthe inadequacy felt by so many respondents. However, respondents found composition\nand musical notation very difficult to teach.\nWhen asked if they linked music with other subjects, 66% responded \u2018yes\u2019 and 34%\nsaid \u2018no.\u2019 Moreover, 52% felt more confident teaching music when linked with other\nsubjects and 26% did not. Twenty-one per cent did not respond. To determine whether\nthe difference in responses between KS1 and KS2 were significant, a chi-squared test was\napplied with the no-response and not applicable categories removed, and a significant\nagreement was established (p = 0.08).\nD i s c u s s i o n s and c on c l u s i o n\nDo non-spec i a l i s t s f ee l confi d en t t o t each m us i c?\nOf the non-specialist teachers, 6% were found to feel very confident to teach music, 52%\nreasonably confident and 39% not confident, while 3% did not respond. Although this\namounts to 58% of non-specialists having some degree of confidence to teach music,\n32\nThe teach i ng o f mus i c i n t he p r ima r y s choo l b y t he non-mus i c spec i a l i s t\nmusic was found to be the subject which most teachers ranked last on the confidence\nscale of subjects and the lowest mean score when subjects were ranked in order of\nconfidence. Several reasons may account for this. Teachers were daunted by the idea of\nsinging, especially if unsure of their own voice and their ability to stay in tune. Respondents\nfound singing much harder when working with older children which undermined teachers\u2019\nconfidence; a consequence of their low musical ability and lack of subject knowledge.\nThe survey also indicated a significant link between initial teacher training and\nteachers\u2019 levels of confidence (p = 0.18). Given this relationship it was found that a higher\nproportion of teachers who had entered the profession up to 10 years ago received initial\nteacher training in music than those who had been teaching for 11 years or more. Any\nrelationship assumed between initial training and confidence could therefore include length\nof teaching experience. In addition, a marginal link was discovered between the number of\nyears teaching and confidence to teach music, implying that those teachers with ten years\nprimary experience or less, were likely to feel more confident to teach music than those\nwho had been teaching longer.\nThis implies that newer entrants to the profession are likely to feel more confident in\nteaching music due to the receipt of initial teacher training in music. But the interviews\nrevealed that, in their view, respondents felt this training did not equip them to teach\nmusic effectively. Additional causes for greater confidence could be enthusiasm and a\nreadiness to increase subject knowledge or experiment with new ideas and teaching\nmethods. Furthermore, a highly significant link (p = 0.010) was found between musical\nqualifications and confidence to teach music. This does not prove causality, but suggests\nthe possibility that those teachers with practical musical qualifications are more likely to\nfeel confident to teach it. Not surprisingly, those teachers with musical qualifications are\nmore likely to have a personal interest in music and therefore, a greater understanding of\nthe subject.\nThe possibility of personal interest in music affecting confidence is supported by\nthe highly significant link discovered between participation in musical activities and\nconfidence to teach music. This suggests that those teachers who participate in musical\nactivities are more likely to feel confident to teach it. Again, higher confidence levels could\nalso be caused by the greater personal interest and increased knowledge and understanding\nof the subject brought about by personal participation.\nTeache r s \u2019 a t t i t udes t o wa rds mus i c\nOf the sample studied, all but seven participated in some form of musical activity. Thirty\nlistened to music for pleasure, but did not take a more active form of participation. The\nremaining 34 sang or played a musical instrument and thirty of these also listened to music\nfor pleasure. It can therefore be seen that a high proportion do enjoy some form of music.\nSeventy-seven per cent also felt able to promote music as an enjoyable subject, although\nstatistically no significant link was established between participating in musical activities\nand feeling able to promote music. It was also acknowledged by respondents that sound\nsubject knowledge enabled teachers to convey their enthusiasm for music to children and\ngave them credibility in the teaching situation.\n33\nH i l a r y Ho l den and S tua r t B u t t on\nSuppo r t i n mus i c t each i ng\nThe survey findings indicate that 56% of non-specialist teachers did rely on instructions\nprovided by a scheme or text in order to teach music. The schemes identified were quite\nprescriptive, with tapes and lesson plans. They were followed religiously but without proper\ninterpretation. The interviewees commented that the reason for this was their inadequate\nbackground knowledge.\nThere is evidence to show that teachers generally felt most confident teaching rhythm or\nlistening, and 72% of non-specialists were found to feel more confident teaching activities\nsuch as clapping games, musical appreciation and the historical aspects of music, than with\nteaching music theory. They commented that the historical aspects could be researched,\npresumably more easily than aspects of musical content.\nRespondents were concerned about so-called tone deafness, ability to pitch notes and\nan inability to read musical notation and the difficulty of teaching it \u2013 a consequence of low\nconfidence and inadequate input at teacher training level. Several interviewees commented\nthat even with curriculum support they found notation difficult to understand and teach.\nEvidence from the present survey suggests that non-specialist teachers of music\nreceived the following forms of support, in descending order of frequency of response:\npublished schemes, use of school schemes of work, text books on music, INSET, teacher\nguides, own knowledge and ideas, school music co-ordinator, television programmes and\nradio broadcasts. The least frequent form of support available was support in the classroom\nfrom a specialist musician.\nFifty-two percent of KS1 respondents felt more able to use their own knowledge and\nideas compared with 26% of KS2 teachers. A higher use of all other forms of support\nby KS2 teachers is suggested, with the exception of INSET. Clearly, this suggests that KS2\nteachers require greater support than KS1 teachers in meeting the National Curriculum\nrequirements and to reliance on instructions in order to teach music. Sixty-one per cent of\nKS2 respondents rely on instructions compared with KS1 respondents, although this was\ndiscovered to be only marginally significant (p = 0.20). Teachers used schemes as a prop\nchoosing aspects of the scheme they felt comfortable with, as these compensated for a lack\nof teacher knowledge.\nResponses were also examined in connection with confidence levels, and it was noted\nthat those teachers who used their own knowledge and ideas, 33% felt very confident to\nteach music \u2013 a higher proportion of \u2018very confident\u2019 respondents than any other form\nof support. However, this does not prove causality. It could be argued that teachers who\nare able to use their own knowledge and ideas feel more confident to teach music, or\nthat those teachers with more confidence are more likely to use their own knowledge and\nideas. Similarly, low confidence levels are suggested by those respondents using television\nprogrammes and radio broadcasts, (69% of those using this kind of support did not feel\nconfident to teach music \u2013 a higher proportion than for any other form of support), but the\nresponse does not clarify whether it is because television and radio programmes do not\nbuild teachers\u2019 confidence or that teachers with low confidence levels tend to use television\nand radio broadcasts to support their teaching.\nResponses were also examined in connection with teachers\u2019 ability to teach music\nindependently. The data here are perhaps not reliable due to the high non-response to the\n34\nThe teach i ng o f mus i c i n t he p r ima r y s choo l b y t he non-mus i c spec i a l i s t\nquestion on independent teaching, but it is interesting to note that the highest independent\nlevels (89%) arose from those respondents who received advice and assistance from their\nschool music co-ordinators. One of the lowest independence levels was that of respondents\nwho used their own knowledge and ideas, which is surprising as one would expect this\nto enable independence of teaching. Eighty three percent of those teachers receiving in-\nclass support felt able to teach music independently. It is possible that this is due to\nanother teacher teaching music to their class, although arguably this is not independent\nteaching on the part of the class teacher, or that class teachers are gaining independence\nthrough working with, or observing a specialist. The lowest independence levels (69%),\nas with confidence levels, arose from the group of respondents using television and radio\nbroadcasts.\nWha t k i nd o f suppo r t wou l d t he non-spec i a l i s t l i k e t o r ece i ve?\nThe survey response indicates a strong preference (58%) for in-class support by a music\nspecialist. Following this in order of preference were INSET sessions (41%), in-class training\nfrom tape, or video or television lessons (25%), personal training at home or in teachers\u2019\nown time (14%).\nClass teachers interviewed spoke in favour of in-class support, describing a difference\nin children\u2019s music since receiving this form of assistance, and how a different teacher\ncan stimulate activity. Clearly, this suggests that regular support over the academic year\nmight be helpful in order to provide an opportunity for class teachers to follow up input\non their own before some different input from a specialist. This may give time for any\nproblem areas to be identified by the class teacher, before meeting the music co-ordinator.\nPartnership teaching is a way of working together, sharing ideas and encouraging teacher\nconfidence. Although in-class support from a music co-ordinator was the least frequently\nreceived, this was identified as the preferred resource above other forms of training. In\naddition, packs for teaching with learning outcomes for each year group, teacher and child\nfriendly lesson plans, tapes or videos, would be helpful. But these schemes need to be\nmore comprehensive that those suggested by class teachers. Since the completion of this\nstudy schemes have been published to support the National Curriculum and the new QCA\nScheme of Work for Music, notably Music Express and the Language Centre Publications,\nMusic Resource Files.\nIt might be helpful for teachers if schemes of work are linked with the National\nCurriculum Programmes of Study, allowing progression and continuity from term to term.\nThese schemes could then identify the key skills to be taught, how they relate to each other\nand linked to time allocation in order to create a balance between each aspect of music\ntaught. Teaching strategies and activities, which children will be engaged in, should also\nbe identified. In addition, assessment opportunities, resource allocation and possibilities\nfor differentiation may also need highlighting for quality learning to take place.\nIn our view, this kind of scheme may be more effective if it emerges from staff\ndiscussions and agreement. Participation by class teachers in developing the music\ncurriculum creates a sense of identity, fosters more commitment in meeting aims and\nobjectives and dissipates resistance to change. We argue that the teaching of music in\n35\nH i l a r y Ho l den and S tua r t B u t t on\nthe primary school may not develop unless there is an opportunity for class teachers\u2019\nprofessional development and that may include experience of making music. Teachers\nrequire the opportunity and support to explore new approaches to teaching music in the\ncontext of their own classroom with the active support of a specialist teacher.\nConc l u s i o n\nThe survey indicates that class teachers are keen to maintain a classroom working\nenvironment for all curriculum subjects, but comments were made on the importance of a\nspecialist teacher for musical expertise. It was agreed that greater subject knowledge would\nincrease confidence to teach music and that this may best be developed by working with\nspecialist teachers in the classroom. The implication is that while teachers are confident\nin their own pedagogical skills, they are less secure with music subject matter, content\nand knowledge. It is suggested that senior management consider instigating a collegial\nstrategy, to allow collaboration, co-operation and communication to be improved between\nthe music and non-music specialist. We believe an approach of this kind may foster mutual\ntrust and lead to the professional growth of the non-music specialist. However, this as-\nsumes that a music specialist is available in each school, which we know is not always\ntrue. In these cases, there is perhaps a need for music consultants to support teachers in\nmusical pedagogy and practical ideas.\nThis study confirms that there is a lower teacher confidence in music compared to\nother subjects. It highlights that KS2 teachers are generally less confident in their ability to\nteach music and less likely to feel they are meeting the National Curriculum requirements\nfor music. It observes that many non-specialists feel more comfortable leading musical\nactivities than with teaching music theory and suggests that teachers can be deterred by\ncomposition and musical notation. Data also suggest that where teachers do link music\nwith other subjects, a high proportion of KS2 teachers find music easier to teach. Moreover,\na significant relationship was established between initial teacher training in music, musical\nqualifications, personal interest in music and confidence to teach it.\nComments made at interview indicate that music is still perceived as a specialist\nsubject, requiring expertise and performing ability. One implication of this for teaching is a\nneed to increase teacher confidence in music, through developing subject knowledge and\ndemonstrating to teachers musical activities which do not require a high level of musical\nperformance on their part.\nAs a way forward it is suggested that a long-term staff development programme\nis required to enhance learning and teaching of music by the non-specialist. Such a\nprogramme might take account of active learning experiences by modelling skills and\nteaching strategies. The teachers require the opportunity to trial ideas and demonstrate\nthe skills that have been assimilated through INSET and CPD if they are going to make a\nlong-term impact on classroom music. This might be achieved through workshops on skills-\ntraining under \u2018simulated conditions\u2019 (Weatherley, 2000: 21), creating the opportunity to\nresolve difficulties, and reflecting and reviewing practice through feedback. These new skills\ncould then be transferred and realised into effective teaching, with the support of the music\nco-ordinator in a more relaxed atmosphere in the classroom. In our opinion, this may\nminimise the threat to the teacher\u2019s self-esteem, promote a positive self-image, improve\n36\nThe teach i ng o f mus i c i n t he p r ima r y s choo l b y t he non-mus i c spec i a l i s t\nsubject knowledge and raise their level of confidence. Developing teachers\u2019 practical\nmusical skills and increasing access to support from music specialists seems crucial if\nteachers and children are to fulfil their musical potential.\nRe f e r e n c e s\nALEXANDER, R., ROSE, J. & WOODHEAD, C.
