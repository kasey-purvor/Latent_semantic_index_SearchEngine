J. Reeves1* & T. R. West2\n1 British Geological Survey, Kingsley Dunham Centre, Keyworth, Nottingham NG12 5GG, UK\n2 Purdue University, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Science, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA\n*Corresponding author (e-mail: hjre@bgs.ac.uk)\nAbstract: Since the development of the first 2D urban geological map of Bath by William Smith in 1799, the production and\nrepresentation of geological information has changed little until relatively recently. In the last 20 years, information technology\nand increased computing capacities have transformed the way in which geoscientists work. In particular, the development and\nuse of geographic information systems (GISs) and modelling packages have meant that there is now a far greater opportunity to\ndevelop engineering geological products that show more effectively the third dimension in the urban environment. Because the\ninformation is captured and manipulated digitally, the outputs can be tailored to various end-user needs and more readily updated\nas new data become available. To illustrate these developments a brief overview of the 30 papers that were submitted to the\nTheme \u2018Geodata for the Urban Environment\u2019 of the 10th International Congress of the International Association for Engineering\nGeology and the Environment (IAEG) are presented and discussed.\nThree-dimensional geological modelling is revolutionizing\ngeological interpretation in the urban environment. It is a\ntool that, for the first time, is allowing geologists and\nengineering geologists to create and communicate, interac-\ntively, 3D geological and engineering geological models,\nwhich were previously developed as 2D images (maps\nand cross-sections) by combining ground investigation\ninformation and geological knowledge. For engineering\napplications in the urban environment, the modelling has\nprovided a 3D framework for the spatial presentation\nand interpretation of geotechnical data (Culshaw 2005).\nFrom these spatial data, engineering geological classifi-\ncations can be formulated and the engineering geological\nground conditions visualized. Engineers and geologists\ncan use these in urban environments to assist in the recog-\nnition and identification of problematic ground conditions\n(Reeves et al. 2005), as a tool to aid in the planning and\nlocation of ground investigations, and to ensure that the\nmost economical and valuable information is obtained\nfrom ground surveys. By using examples from the 30\npapers that were submitted to the Theme \u2018Geodata for\nthe Urban Environment\u2019of the 10th International Congress\nof the International Association for Engineering Geology\nand the Environment (IAEG) these concepts and ideas\nwill be presented to demonstrate how engineering geologi-\ncal products can show the third dimension, allow the\nspatial attribution of geotechnical data and, hence, allow\nthe effective communication of engineering geological\ninformation to audiences of specialist and non-specialist\nbackgrounds.\nSummary of papers submitted to the\nTheme \u2018Geodata for the Urban\nEnvironment\u2019\nIn the 30 papers that were submitted to the Theme, five Q1key\ntopics that were covered: (1) the development of spatial\ndatabases for borehole and geotechnical information; (2)\nthe development of GISs, for geoscientific purposes; (3) the\ndevelopment of dynamic 3D geoscientific computer models,\nwhich hold and manipulate large spatial datasets (such as\nborehole and geotechnical data); (4) the development of\nsophisticated knowledge-based and decision-making tools\nfor a variety of specialist and non-specialist users; (5)\nexamples and case studies of specific types of geodata\nused in the urban environment.\nOf these topics, the first four will form the basis of the dis-\ncussion in this paper. A brief summary of the highlights of\neach topic and some examples from the papers submitted\nto the Theme are discussed below. These summaries aim\nto indicate how engineering geological products can show\nthe third dimension, allow the spatial attribution of geotech-\nnical data, and hence allow the effective communication of\nengineering geological information to a wide range of users.\nDevelopment of spatial databases\nFour papers were submitted on the topic of the \u2018Develop-\nment of spatial databases\u2019. These varied from papers that\nFrom: CULSHAW, M. G., REEVES, H. J., JEFFERSON, I. & SPINK, T. W.

(2009)\nand Giles (2009).\nNgan-Tillard et al. (2009) discussed a large geotechnical\ndatabase of cone penetration test (CPT) data that was devel-\noped by municipalities, scientific institutes and geotechnical\nengineering consultants in The Netherlands. Ngan-Tillard\net al. (2009) demonstrated a specialist clustering tool\u2019s\nability to analyse and effectively interpret the shallow sub-\nsurface from these data. In comparison, Oliveira et al.\n(2009) described a similar database (GEODATA) that has\nbeen complied for the Portuguese city of Oporto. This data-\nbase formed an integral part to a larger engineering geologi-\ncal mapping programme of work in the city (see below in the\nsection on \u2018Development of GISs for geoscientific pur-\nposes\u2019). The GEODATA database consisted of three main\nmodules that hold geophysical investigation information,\nmechanical investigation information and in situ test results.\nThe more complex and integrated geoscientific database\nmanagement systems that have been produced as a result\nof recent developments in Geoinformatics have allowed\nsystems as described by Kiehle et al. (2009) to be developed.\nThis system is called the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). It\nmanages huge amounts of spatially related data and fosters\nthe reuse of existing data inventories for future uses that\nare not yet known. Themain building block of the hypothesis\nis that spatially related data are available in several places.\nThe data storage and preparation is located with the data pro-\nviders. The task of data preparation, manipulation and retrie-\nval is carried out using Web services and, hence, is available\nto a multitude of users. In comparison, Giles (2009)\ndescribed a similar system that the British Geological\nSurvey (BGS) is developing (the BGS Geodata index).\nAll the papers discussed above highlight the important\nrole that data and databases have in large geotechnical and\nengineering geological projects in the urban environment.\nWith more information being available through well-\nmanaged systems, better results are produced. To supply\nthe relevant information, all data have to be collected and\nstored in one place, which is an extensive task. Therefore,\nit is vital to have the correct infrastructure in place to\nacquire, manage and distribute the geoscientific information\nfrom these systems in a way that gives potential users\nconfidence and the information that they want. Without the\ndevelopment of these well-designed and managed systems,\nvaluable ground investigation data and information can be\nlost and, hence, not incorporated into current, as well as\nfuture, studies and investigations.\nDevelopment of GISs for geoscientific purposes\nEleven papers were submitted that covered the topic \u2018Devel-\nopment of Geographical Information Systems (GISs) for\ngeoscientific purposes\u2019. Collectively, the submitted papers\nhighlighted various ways that a GIS can be used to aid\ngeoscientific data visualization and investigations in urban\nenvironments. Papers submitted generally fell into two\ncategories: (1) cartographic production and data holding of\nmaps; (2) interrogation of spatial datasets using specialist\ntools and functionality. Many of the papers have demon-\nstrated how a GIS can produce and manage information\nfrom geological, engineering geological and environmental\nmapping projects within the urban environment. For\nexample, Mironov (2009) presented a project that described\nhow a GIS was used to manage a geological mapping project\nthat investigated ancient buried erosion valleys in Moscow.\nSimilarly, Oliveira et al. (2009) produced a comprehensive\nengineering geological map of the city of Oporto. One\noutput was a Geotechnical Zoning Map. The GIS and maps\nproduced for this project are now used as an important tool\nfor land-use planning and management in Oporto. A similar\nengineering geological GIS to manage an engineering geo-\nlogical mapping project proposed for the southeastern part\nof Brazil was discussed by Bastos & Zuquette (2009).\nIn addition to the production and management of geologi-\ncal, engineering geological and environmental maps, a GIS\nalso can be used to produce more complex maps with\nadditional functionality. Four papers gave examples of this\n(Calijuror et al. 2009; Harrison & Forster 2009; Q2Mellon &\nFrize 2009; Zhou & Yao 2009). Mellon & Frize (2009) pre-\nsented a GIS-based system that centrally held spatial and\ntabular datasets. The key feature of this system was the\nseamless link from the GIS to a digital archive of scanned\nreports and borehole logs held in an electronic document\nmanagement system. In comparison, Calijura et al. (2009), Q2\nHarrison & Forster (2009) and Zhou & Yao (2009) demon-\nstrated a slightly different application of a GIS, whereby a\ngeo-referenced database was manipulated in a GIS environ-\nment. Calijura et al. (2009) Q2discussed a risk map in an urban\nenvironment that was produced using this technique. The\nChinese Geological Hazard Information System was\ndescribed by Zhou & Yao (2009), and they demonstrated\nhow the stored geohazard information for China on land-\nslides, land subsidence, debris flows, ground fissuring and\nother geohazards is managed. Harrison & Forster (2009)\ndescribed a similar project called GeoHazarD. This is\ndescribed further below under the topic \u2018Knowledge-based\nand decision-making tools\u2019.\nOne of the most powerful attributes of a GIS is the ability\nto interrogate spatial datasets using specialist tools and func-\ntionality. A number of papers gave examples of a GIS being\nused in this manner. Apolina\u00b4rio-Francisco et al. (2009), for\nexample, described a GIS-based research project in the\ncity of Brasilia, Brazil. This project made use of spatial\nanalytical tools to investigate, estimate and model the loss\nof soil in this region. This study supported the socio-\neconomic and environmental planning in the short and\nmedium term, as well as being able to model future scenarios\nof this geodynamic phenomenon. In comparison, Moreda-\nMendes & Lorandi (2009) and Choi & Park (2009) demon-\nstrated the use of geostatistical methods within a GIS\nenvironment to spatially analyse data. Moreda-Mendes\nH. J. REEVES & T. R. WEST210\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n67\n68\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n83\n84\n85\n86\n87\n88\n89\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n99\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\n105\n106\n107\n108\n109\n110\n111\n112\n113\n114\n& Lorandi (2009) discussed how geostatistics (with indi-\ncator geostatistical resources) are used to create probabilistic\nmaps, which show where the most favourable areas for con-\nstructing foundations at specific depths can be found in the\nSa\u02dco Jose\u00b4 do Rio Preto urban area (Brazil). Choi & Park\n(2009), in comparison, demonstrated how, within a GIS\nenvironment, interrogation of data and 3D geostatistical\nmethods can be used to predict variation of soil properties,\nsuch as hydraulic conductivity.\nThe key observation from all of the papers under this topic\nis how GISs, are now common tools of practice for geotech-\nnical engineers and engineering geologists. They form a fun-\ndamental platform for data collection, visualization and\ncommunication of geotechnical and engineering geological\ninformation to a wide range of end-users (e.g. geologists,\nengineers, planners, the general public).\nDynamic 3D computer models\nDynamic 3D computer models are the most rapidly expand-\ning research area within geoscience; this is mainly due to\nthe increase in computing capacities and capabilities. Eight\npapers were submitted on this topic. Some papers looked at\naspects of 3D geological modelling (Bourgine et al. 2009;\nDeveleeschouwer & Pouriel 2009; Neber et al. 2009;\nPalmu et al. 2009)Q3 ranging from case studies to wider appli-\ncations and the attribution of 3D geological models with\ngeotechnical, engineering geological and other data.\nBreysse et al. (2009) and Bougine et al. (2009) presented a\ncase study of geotechnical modelling undertaken at a town\nscale, which focused on the southern part of Bordeaux,\nFrance. The purpose of this work was to reinterpret the near-\nsurface geological model to develop information that was\nmore useful for urban planning. In comparison, Neumann\net al. (2009) depicted a project that was undertaken by the\nState Geological Survey of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany,\nwhere engineering geological maps of the city ofMagdeburg\nwith seven thematic map sheets were produced. From this,\ninnovative interactive computer modelling techniques were\napplied using a 3D spatial modelling package with an inter-\nactive 3D modeller to create a 3D engineering geological\nmodel of the subsurface. A similar case study by Merritt\net al. (2009) has been undertaken in Glasgow, UK, in collab-\noration with Glasgow City Council, which is discussed\nfurther below under the topic \u2018Knowledge-based and\ndecision-making tools\u2019.\nThe models discussed above are all generally based on\nurban centres but there were a few examples from the\npapers submitted that also dealt with more site-specific\nengineering geological modelling. Van Knapen & Slob\n(2009) discussed an automated identification method for\n3D engineering geological rock mass characterization of dis-\ncontinuity sets, using the results from a terrestrial laser\nscanner survey. From this survey a dense point cloud was\ngenerated that represented the geometry of the scanned\nrock face. Through 3D surface reconstruction techniques\nthe original rock face could be rebuilt and, hence,\nidentification of the discontinuity sets and characterization\nof the rock mass could be undertaken. Using similar scan-\nning technology, Rahman et al. (2009) were also able to\nquantify the surface roughness of discontinuities within a\nrock mass.\nFrom the papers submitted under this topic, it is apparent\nthat 3D computer modelling is starting to be used in a wide\nspectrum of applications, from regional 3D urban geological\nmodelling to specialist site-scale projects. In addition, it is\nalso being undertaken using a variety of tools and methods.\nKnowledge-based and decision-making tools\nThe development of \u2018Knowledge-based and decision-\nmaking tools\u2019 cannot be undertaken without the develop-\nment of information technology systems such as spatial\ndatabases, GISs for geoscientific purposes and dynamic 3D\ncomputer models. Knowledge-based and decision-making\ntools form the \u2018front end\u2019 or \u2018final end-product\u2019 of the infor-\nmation technology systems that are developed. As a result,\nthey can take a multitude of forms and can portray data and\ninformation to a multitude of end-users, not just those with\ngeological training and expertise. In the papers submitted\nunder this topic, this approach was presented by Gocmez\net al. (2009), Harrison & Forster (2009), Li et al. (2009),\nMartin & Toll (2009) and Merritt et al. (2009).\nMerritt et al. (2009) presented a fully integrated geologi-\ncal model, where INSIGHT Geologische Softwaresysteme\nGmbH have developed, in collaboration with the BGS, a\nlinked 3D geological and attributed property model for part\nof Glasgow, UK, which deals with several geoscientific\nissues (hydrogeological, geotechnical, engineering geologi-\ncal, geohazards and uncertainty). In contrast, Gocmez et al.\n(2009), Harrison & Forster (2009), Li et al. (2009) and\nMartin & Toll (2009) presented systems that are designed\nto deal with more specific problems.\nFor example, Harrison & Forster (2009) described a rule-\nbased system using ArcGIS that combines digital vector geo-\nlogical data. This system (GeoHazarD) integrated expert\nknowledge, national databases, multi-criterion analysis and\na flexible rule-based approach to model the geohazard data-\nsets of the UK (collapsible deposits, compressible ground,\nslope instability, running sand, shrink\u2013swell (subsidence\nand heave) and dissolution). The major advantage of this\nsystem is that it produces a fully auditable trail leading to\nthe final geohazard risk classification. This allows the assess-\nment to be updated automatically following a revision of the\nprimary datasets (e.g. by geological mapping). This system\nhas allowed geohazard susceptibility maps of the UK to be\nproduced, which contribute to a number of products that\nportray geohazard risk information to a number of end-users\n(e.g. insurers the general public, local authorities, engineer-\ning consultants).\nIn contrast, Li et al. (2009) described a very detailed\nhighway tunnel decision-making system that has been\napplied to the Zhegu Mount highway tunnel, in the west of\nChina. This system aimed to develop and improve the\nGEODATA FOR THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT 211\n115\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n128\n129\n130\n131\n132\n133\n134\n135\n136\n137\n138\n139\n140\n141\n142\n143\n144\n145\n146\n147\n148\n149\n150\n151\n152\n153\n154\n155\n156\n157\n158\n159\n160\n161\n162\n163\n164\n165\n166\n167\n168\n169\n170\n171\nmethods and techniques that are used when building a\nhighway tunnel. The system synthesizes theory analysis\nand expert judgement and monitors measurements in a\ntunnel to allow the \u2018intelligent\u2019 classification of the wall\nrock, analysis and forecasting of wall rock stress, and analy-\nsis and forecasting of wall rock deformation. This process\nthen allows the security of rock wall supporting structures\nto be assessed. Martin & Toll (2009) have developed a\nsimilar system to that of Li et al. (2009), which is designed\nto address and manage the complex parameters and infor-\nmation required when undertaking a risk assessment exer-\ncise for a contaminated site. To assist with this process, at\nthe preliminary stage of a ground investigation, a prototype\nknowledge-based system (ATTIC: Assessment Tool for The\nInvestigation of Contaminated Land) and database have\nbeen developed to capture the wealth of scientific knowledge\nrequired and ensure that a structured approach to the inves-\ntigation is undertaken.\nThe papers submitted to this topic have shown how the use\nof knowledge-based and decision-making tools is expand-\ning. Such tools are now forming one of the principal\ntechniques to communicate technical and complex geoscien-\ntific data and information to end-users who may or may not\nhave a geoscientific background. These systems are helping\nto increase the effective use of geotechnical and engineering\ngeological information in the urban environment.\nConcluding remarks\nA total of 30 papers were represented within the Theme\n\u2018Geodata for the Urban Environment\u2019 at the IAEG 10th\nInternational Congress. This paper provides a review of\nmany of the papers submitted to this theme. The main con-\nclusions from the papers that were submitted are that, as\ngeoscientists, we can now: develop GIS and 3D computer\nmodels to hold, manipulate and query large databases (bore-\nhole, geotechnical) on a relatively standard desktop compu-\nter; produce dynamic upgradeable models that can be rapidly\nchanged and developed to suit different purposes and\nrequirements; attribute models with geotechnical to hydro-\ngeological to geophysical property data; visualize and\npresent geoscientific data and information to a wide range\nof end-users (geologists, engineering geologists, geotechni-\ncal engineers, civil engineers, planners and the general\npublic).\nFrom the discussion in the session, it was noted that when\nusing GISs and developing 3D models it must not be forgot-\nten that there are standards and procedures that are followed\nin engineering practice (e.g. Eurocodes, ASTM guidelines).\nTherefore, it is vital that the standards and procedures now\nstart to take account of the new methods and techniques\nthat geotechnical engineers and engineering geologists can\nuse to manage and visualize geoscientific data. It is crucial\nthat these standards and procedures are kept up to date and\ntake account of new developments in information\ntechnology, so that practising geoscientists can ensure that\nthey are following good practice.\nReferences\nAPOLINA\u00b4RIO-FRANCISCO, R., VALENTIN, E.
