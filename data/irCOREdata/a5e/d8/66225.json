The policy approach has two distinguishing features \u2013 an\n\u2018outcomes led\u2019 approach rooted in the views of children and young people about what\nconstitutes \u2018wellbeing\u2019 in their lives, and a partnership approach that recognises these\noutcomes can only be achieved through high levels of inter-agency and inter-professional\nworking. This article suggests that the two features may be in tension, and that during\nthe process of implementation there is a danger that user defined outcomes will be\nre-interpreted to fit in with other organisational and professional agendas. The analysis\ndraws upon Rick Matland\u2019s framework for exploring the impact of conflict and ambiguity\nrespectively upon the implementation process.\nI n t roduct ion\nChildren\u2019s services in England are currently undergoing their most radical transformation\nin 50 years. What has become widely known as the Every Child Matters reforms stemming\nfrom the Green Paper of that name (Chief Secretary to the Treasury, 2003) took shape as\nthe Children Act 2004, and implementation is now at an advanced stage. The trigger\nfor these changes was the inquiry by Lord Laming into the tragic death of Victoria\nClimbie (Laming, 2003), which repeated the messages of many earlier such inquiries\nabout the inadequate nature of communication and information sharing amongst relevant\nprofessionals. The Green Paper argued that children\u2019s needs are complex, rarely fit\nneatly within one set of organisational boundaries and that the categories around which\nservices are organised are overlapping, fluid and in some cases blurred. The radical\nsolution was felt to lie in an outcomes-based approach rooted in a \u2018whole systems\u2019\nmodel.\nThe Every Child Matters reforms constitute the epitome of rational decision making,\nwith everything flowing from an outcomes-led approach. Consultations with children and\nyoung people were said to have identified five key outcomes that shape well-being \u2013\nbeing healthy, staying safe, enjoying and achieving, making a positive contribution,\nand achieving economic well-being. This might be characterised as partnership for a\npurpose \u2013 all activity is to be judged by the extent to which it contributes to achievement\nof the five outcomes. It all suggests that the needs of service users and families will be set\nat the forefront of coordinated activity. But how far is this likely to happen?\n227\nBob Hudson\nTable 1 \u2018Every Child Matters\u2019: aims and outcomes\nOutcome Associated Aims\nBeing Healthy \u2022 Physically healthy\n\u2022 Mentally and emotionally healthy\n\u2022 Sexually healthy\n\u2022 Healthy lifestyles\n\u2022 Choose not to take illegal drugs\nStaying Safe \u2022 Safe from maltreatment, neglect, violence and sexual exploitation\n\u2022 Safe from accidental injury and death\n\u2022 Safe from bullying and discrimination\n\u2022 Safe from crime and anti-social behaviour in and out of school\n\u2022 Have security, stability and are cared for\nEnjoy and Achieve \u2022 Ready for school\n\u2022 Attend and enjoy school\n\u2022 Achieve stretching national educational standards at primary\nschool\n\u2022 Achieve stretching national educational standards at\nsecondary school\nMake a Positive \u2022 Engage in decision-making and support the\nContribution community and environment\n\u2022 Engage in law-abiding and positive behaviour in and out of school\n\u2022 Develop positive relationships and choose not to bully and\ndiscriminate\n\u2022 Develop self-confidence and successfully deal with significant\nlife changes and challenges\n\u2022 Develop enterprising behaviour\nAchieve Economic \u2022 Engage in further education, employment or training on leaving\nWellbeing school\n\u2022 Ready for employment\n\u2022 Live in decent homes and sustainable communities\n\u2022 Access to transport and material goods\n\u2022 Live in households free from low incomes\nOutcomes in ch i ld ren \u2019s serv ices\nFirst and foremost, local services will be expected to demonstrate how far their work\nimproves the outcomes for children as laid out in the original Green Paper and\nsubsequently developed in the \u2018Change for Children\u2019 review of December 2004 (HM\nGovernment, 2004). Five outcomes are identified, each with five associated aims as\nshown in Table 1 below.\nThe five outcomes have been given legal force in the Children Act 2004 as the central\ncomponents of wellbeing and the purpose of cooperation between agencies. They are\ncentral to the programme of change, and have generally attracted widespread support.\nThe who le sys tems impera t i ve\nThe breadth of these outcomes implies a huge coordinated effort \u2013 indeed an initial\naccount of progress and intentions portrayed the signatures and photographs of no fewer\n228\nUser Outcomes and Children\u2019s Services Reform\nTable 2 Sections in the Children Act 2004 requiring partnership working\nSection Description\nSection 10: The Duty to\nCooperate\nA duty is placed on Local Authorities to make arrangements\nto promote cooperation between agencies in order to\nimprove children\u2019s well-being defined by reference to the\nfive outcomes, and a duty on key partners to take part in\nthose arrangements. It also provides a new power to allow\npooling of resources in support of these arrangements.\nSection 11: The Duty to\nSafeguard and Promote\nWelfare\nCreates a duty for the key agencies who work with children\nto put in place arrangements to make sure that they take\naccount of the need to safeguard and promote the welfare\nof children when doing their jobs.\nSection 12: Information\nSharing\nAllows further secondary legislation and statutory guidance\nto be made with respect to setting up databases or indexes\nthat contain basic information about children and young\npeople and their families.\nSections 13\u201316: Local\nSafeguarding Children\u2019s\nBoards\nRequires that Local Authorities set up statutory Local\nSafeguarding Children\u2019s Boards, and that the key partners\ntake part.\nSection 17: The Children &\nYoung Person\u2019s Plan\nEstablishes a single plan to replace a range of current\nstatutory planning.\nSections 18\/19: Director of\nChildren\u2019s Services and\nLead Member\nTo be appointed by Local Authorities and to be responsible\nfor, as a minimum, education and children\u2019s social\nservices functions. Local Authorities have discretion to\nadd other relevant functions such as leisure or housing if\nthey feel it is appropriate.\nSections 20\u201324: Integrated\nInspection\nRequire an integrated inspection framework to be\nestablished by the relevant inspectorates to inform future\ninspections of all services for children.\nthan 17 secretaries of state and ministers (HM Government, 2004). The scale of the remit\nis probably best seen in the Children Act itself. The first nine clauses are concerned with\nthe establishment of the Children\u2019s Commissioner, and there are some miscellaneous\nchanges to such things as private fostering in Part 5, but the bulk of the Act rests squarely\nupon systematic rather than ad hoc partnership working. This is shown in Table 2.\nThe ambigu i t y\u2013con f l i c t mat r i x\nThe question to be explored here is the relationship between these two policy imperatives \u2013\nput simply, is it feasible for a complex range of national and local agencies and professions\nto put service users at the forefront of their interaction and negotiation? In addressing\nthis question, use will be made of Rick Matland\u2019s \u2018Ambiguity\u2013Conflict Matrix\u2019 (Matland,\n1995). For Matland, the policy implementation literature has been unhelpfully split into\ntwo major schools \u2013 top-down and bottom-up \u2013 with a tendency for the former to study\nrelatively clear policies, and the latter those policies with greater inherent uncertainty. He\ngoes on to suggest that this difference has two features \u2013 ambiguity and conflict \u2013 and that\n229\nBob Hudson\nTable 3 Matland\u2019s ambiguity-conflict matrix (adapted)\nLow Conflict High Conflict\nAdministrative Implementation Political Implementation\nLow\nAmbiguity\n\u2022 goals are given and a means for\nproblem solving is known\n\u2022 a central authority has the\ninformation, resources and\nsanction capability to enact the\ndesired policy\n\u2022 implementation is hierarchically\nordered with each link receiving\norders from the level above\n\u2022 policy is spelled out explicitly at\neach level and there is agreement\non responsibilities and tasks\n\u2022 relatively uniform outcomes at the\nmicro-level across many sites\n\u2022 there is conflict over both goals\nand means\n\u2022 the implementation process is a\nkey arena for conflict\n\u2022 implementation outcomes are\ndetermined by the distribution of\npower\n\u2022 compliance is not automatically\nforthcoming\n\u2022 low ambiguity ensures that\nmonitoring of compliance is\nrelatively easy\nExperimental Implementation Symbolic Implementation\nHigh\nAmbiguity\n\u2022 outcomes depend largely on\nwhich actors are involved\n\u2022 variation in outcomes from site\nto site\n\u2022 outcomes are hard to predict\n\u2022 opportunities for local\nentrepreneurs to create local\npolicies\n\u2022 compliance monitoring\nmechanisms are of limited\nrelevance\n\u2022 the policy may become a low\npriority\n\u2022 ostensibly implausible\ncombination\n\u2022 salient symbols can produce high\nlevels of conflict even when the\npolicy is vague\n\u2022 outcomes will vary across sites\n\u2022 outcomes will depend upon the\nbalance of local coalition strength\n\u2022 policy ambiguity makes it\ndifficult to monitor activities\nbuilding a more effective model of implementation requires evaluation of these policy\ncharacteristics.\nPolicy conflict will exist when more than one stakeholder sees a policy as directly\nrelevant to its interests and when these stakeholders have incongruous views. Such\ndifferences can arise regarding either the putative goals of a policy or the implementation\nschedule and activities. Policy ambiguity can refer to ambiguity of goals and means. In top-\ndown models, goal clarity is an important factor that directly shapes policy success, but\none of the ways to limit conflict is through ambiguity. Ambiguity also affects policy means,\nfor example when there are uncertainties about what roles various stakeholders will play\nin the implementation process. Building on this, Matland proposes his ambiguity\u2013conflict\nmatrix with each quadrant showing the type of implementation process and the central\nprinciples determining outcomes for this type of implementation. This has been adapted\nto describe more fully some of the key features within each quadrant (Table 3).\nAlthough ambiguity and conflict are presented as dichotomous, this is strictly to\nsimplify the exposition. Matland emphasises that the theoretical constructs are continuous.\n230\nUser Outcomes and Children\u2019s Services Reform\nAs a policy gradually moves across a dimension, for example, from low to high conflict,\nthe implementation process is expected increasingly to show the characteristics of the\nquadrant being moved toward, and decreasingly to show the characteristics of the\nparadigm being moved away from. However, he argues that: \u2018There is no tipping point at\nwhich a slight move up or down causes a radical shift from one type of implementation\nto another\u2019 (p.159).\nHow can this matrix help us to understand children\u2019s services reform, especially\nthe apparent primacy afforded to children, young people and their families or carers?\nAt the time of writing there has been little published analysis of the Every Child Matters\nchanges, other than some early official monitoring (Education and Skills Select Committee,\n2005) and some initial analysis of the nature and scale of the partnership remit (Hudson,\n2005). The changes can be seen as having several key components \u2013 those concerned\nwith desired policy outcomes (the five outcomes identified above), those concerned\nwith policy means (the measures shown in Table 2), and those concerned with user\nengagement. At the level of policy rhetoric, the first and last of these will be the ways in\nwhich partnership working is tailored to the views and needs of service users, with the\npolicy means providing the vehicle through which this will be achieved.\nThe user engagement impera t i ve\nThe user engagement measures themselves consist of three main elements \u2013 the five\noutcomes, the appointment of a Children\u2019s Commissioner for England, and a general\ninjunction to involve children, young people and families. Although ostensibly a strong\ntriumvirate, each has weaknesses.\nO p e r a t i o n a l i s i n g th e fi v e ou t c o m e s\nThe vehicle for breathing operational life into the five outcomes is the new Integrated\nInspection Framework (IIF), which was the subject of intense early development. The\nformal consultation documents (Ofsted, 2004a,b,c,d) were published in December\n2004 with a deadline of the end of February 2005. A summary of responses to the\nconsultation was published in May 2005 (Ofsted, 2005), followed by publication of\nproposed guidelines (DfES, 2005) and a further final period of consultation that lasted\nuntil June 2005. No other part of the reforms received such attention, and the first round\nof integrated inspections started in September 2005.\nResponses to the 2004 Discussion Paper included the view that the outcomes were\nunduly aspirational (Ofsted, 2004e) \u2013 an important caveat, for outcomes need to be\nseen as capable of achievement if they are to motivate the relevant contributors. The\nbreadth and ambition of the identified outcomes contributed to a related concern that\nthere were not enough reliable performance indicators to determine whether progress\nwas being made. The response to this concern was to develop five aims associated with\neach outcome (shown in Table 1 above) and to then attach targets or indicators to each\nof them. It is at this point that the devil can be found in the detail, for the crucial issue is\nthe extent to which the targets and indicators reflect the outcomes.\nAn important tension unfolds here between the aspirational nature of the aims and\noutcomes, and the principle of \u2018proportionate inspecting\u2019. The May 2004 Discussion\n231\nBob Hudson\nPaper (Ofsted, 2004e) stated that:\nJudgements about service contributions made under the Framework will be consistent with\nrelevant national service standards and performance indicators associated with them. (p. 8)\nFor practical purposes this means the measurement of outcomes is to be restricted to\nexisting standards, indicators and targets across the relevant partner agencies. This is\nan important restriction, since it is questionable whether existing measures have the\nnecessary breadth to capture the new aims and outcomes. \u2018Being Healthy\u2019, for example,\nis described in the Green Paper in terms of avoiding negative behaviour, \u2018enjoying and\nachieving\u2019 seems to be reduced to school attendance and achievement, while \u2018making\na positive contribution\u2019 has been largely cast as the avoidance of anti-social behaviour.\nA further effect of the reliance upon existing standards and indicators is the high use of\neducation measures as compared with those of other core partners.\nT h e C h i l d r e n \u2019s C o m m i s s i o n e r\nThe role of the Children\u2019s Commissioner for England is defined in statute as \u2018promoting\nawareness of the views and interests of children in England\u2019. This differs from the remit\nof many other Children\u2019s Commissioners in Europe (including those in the devolved\nadministrations of the UK) whose remits are framed in terms of promoting and protecting\nchildren\u2019s rights in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child. During the passage of the Children Act through Parliament, the purpose of\nthe Commissioner for England\u2019s role was the subject of extensive debate, with many\ncommentators arguing that, as well as being out of keeping with existing Commissioners,\nanything other than a rights-based role would lead to a weak Commissioner who differed\nlittle in effect from children\u2019s charities.\nIn the event, an amendment to the Children Act 2004 stipulated that the Children\u2019s\nCommissioner \u2018must have regard\u2019 to the European Convention on the Rights of the Child\n(ECRC) in discharging his or her duties. The Education and Skills Select Committee (2005)\nstated that it was unconvinced that a role primarily defined in terms of promoting children\u2019s\nviews would be as effective in practice as one focused on promoting children\u2019s rights in\naccordance with the ECRC. Other concerns have focused on the likely independence\nof the Commissioner for England. The Children Act 2004 gives the Secretary of State\npower to direct the Commissioner to conduct an inquiry into a particular subject. The\nappointee for England will also be under an obligation to consult with the Secretary of State\nbefore undertaking any inquiry or investigation. The potential for political interference\nworries many, and has been perceived as something which fundamentally undermines\nthe neutrality and likely effectiveness of the role, as well as being out of step with the\nposition of comparable Commissioners of other countries.\nThe e ngagemen t p r i nc ip l e\nThe Every Child Matters Green Paper (HM Treasury, 2003) was bold on this matter, stating\nthat:\nThe creation of an organisation defined by its client group rather than professional functions\noffers an important opportunity to involve children and young people in decision making . . .The\n232\nUser Outcomes and Children\u2019s Services Reform\nGovernment is committed to providing more opportunities for children and young people to\nget involved in the planning, delivery and evaluation of policies and services relevant to them.\n(p. 78)\nIn practice this has been limited at the national level to the creation of a Children and\nYouth Board consisting of 25 young people who will advise the Government on children\u2019s\nissues and of which little has been heard. Meanwhile, at local level, genuine engagement\nof young people is proving predictably difficult. In the case of schools, research conducted\nfor the Home Office (Hine, 2004; Hine et al., 2004) found that \u2013 contrary to the ideals\nenshrined in the five outcomes \u2013 the biggest complaint by children was that they were\nnot listened to, and that their views were not treated with respect. Although some schools\nhad councils or other systems for consulting children, many children believed them to be\ntokenistic. And in the case of the Children\u2019s Fund, which has a specific brief to develop\nparticipation as part of its service development, the national evaluation concluded that\nthe views of children and young people had only a limited impact on decisions about\npublic services (Department for Education and Skills, 2004).\nThe po l i cy means impera t i ve\nIf the user engagement has been dealt with relatively weakly, what has been developed\nmore strongly is the agenda on policy means \u2013 the complex array of structures and\nprocesses outlined in Table 2. It is in these areas that a plethora of guidance has been\nissued, in which major local restructurings have been instituted, and where highly paid\nnew posts have been created. As local agencies have scrambled to meet deadlines\non setting up new children\u2019s trusts, merging their education and children\u2019s social care\nfunctions, appointing directors of children\u2019s services, and developing complex information\nsharing systems, the user engagement imperative has taken a back seat.\nAt national level, as argued above, the urgent need to operationalise the five outcomes\nfor the purposes of integrated inspection, has resulted in a dilution of the outcomes to\nmatch organisational capacities and priorities. In the meantime, the key policy in the world\nof education \u2013 the Five Year Strategy (DfES, 2004a) \u2013 seems to be pulling in a different\ndirection to the inclusive agenda of the Every Child Matters approach. The emphasis in\nthe former is on the autonomy of schools, including encouragement to adopt foundation\nstatus, with an implied diminution in the role of local authorities, whereas the focus\nof the latter is on an area-wide arrangement of services delivered through partnership\narrangements.\nApp ly ing the ambigu i t y\u2013con f l i c t mat r i x\nMatland\u2019s ambiguity\u2013conflict matrix can help to explain these variations in the\nimplementation process, both in terms of what has happened to date and how things\nmight change in the future.

Rather the focus has been upon one dimension\nof the changes \u2013 the user engagement imperative \u2013 with a view to establishing the\nimplementation significance of this, as opposed to the means of policy implementation.\nTable 4 does however reveal several important points:\n\u0001 The focus of implementation activity: In traditional top-down style, the balance of\nimplementation activity is in the \u2018low-ambiguity\u2013low-conflict\u2019 quadrant \u2013 administrative\nimplementation. This is largely the domain of policy means \u2013 issues upon which, in\nprinciple, there is a high degree of consensus, and where implementation is a matter\nof specifying tasks, responsibilities and timetables on the part of a central authority.\nIt is also the quadrant within which state agencies, national and local, will feel most\ncomfortable \u2013 the traditional terrain of structure, process and regulation.\n\u0001 Treatment of the user engagement imperative: The bulk of this domain was, at least\ninitially, left in an ambiguous position, with the result that conflict was low \u2013 the\nexperimental implementation quadrant. In the 2003 Green Paper the five outcomes\nwere presented as self-evidently desirable and couched at a high level of generality,\nwhilst the need to involve children and young people in the decision-making process\nwas referred to only as a passing expectation. As long as things remain in this position,\nmuch will be left to local discretion and there is the likelihood that this domain will be\nseen as less urgent than the development of the policy means.\n\u0001 Movement between the quadrants: Matland\u2019s matrix is dynamic, not static, and issues\ncan shift between quadrants, with subsequent implications for implementation. This\nhappened early on in the case of the Children\u2019s Commissioner, where early enthusiasm\n234\nUser Outcomes and Children\u2019s Services Reform\nfor the concept dissipated as the restrictions on the role became evident \u2013 in effect, a\nshift from the experimental implementation to political implementation. It might also\nbe predicted that once the constraints being placed on the way the five outcomes are\nto be interpreted become more widely appreciated, this too may shift into the political\nimplementation quadrant.\nThe Every Child Matters proposals had, on the whole, an enthusiastic reception\nfrom most stakeholders, including service users and the groups that represent them.\nThe views, needs and interests of children, young people and their carers seemed to\nbe placed at the forefront of reform, and the emphasis upon an outcomes-led approach\nseemed to indicate an important shift in models of policy formulation. However, the policy\nimplementation process has inevitably been the arena in which a clearer sense of direction\nis formed, and it is here that administrative implementation has taken precedence, with\nthe principle of user involvement and engagement characterised more by experimental\nimplementation or political implementation. However well-meaning and committed the\nChildren\u2019s Commissioner may be, the absence of a well-established model of children\u2019s\ncitizenship in England will act as a curb on his impact. This all tends to confirm the view\nthat partnership working continues to find it difficult to put user and carer engagement at\nthe forefront of activity.\nRefe rences\nChief Secretary to the Treasury (2003), Every Child Matters, Cm 5860, London: The Stationary Office.\nDepartment for Education and Skills (2004), \u2018Children, young people, parents and carers\u2019 participation in\nchildren\u2019s fund case study partnerships\u2019, Research Report RR602, London: The Stationary Office.\nDepartment for Education and Skills (2004a), \u2018Five year strategy for children and learners\u2019, London: The\nStationary Office.\nDepartment for Education and Skills (2005), Children\u2019s Services Inspection Regulations, London: The\nStationary Office.\nEducation and Skills Select Committee (2005), \u2018Every Child Matters\u2019, Ninth Report of Session 2004\u20135, HC\n40\u20131, The Stationery Office, London.\nHM Government (2004), \u2018Every Child Matters: change for children\u2019, London: The Stationary Office.\nHine, J.
