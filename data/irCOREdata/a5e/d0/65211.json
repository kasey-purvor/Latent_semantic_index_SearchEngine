This paper discusses the use of the most popular method of making these \nrankings via a multicriteria model which uses the weighted sum of a number of performance \nmeasures to give an overall score on which selection or ranking may be based. The weights \nare a quantitative model of the preferences of those making the evaluation. Many methods are \navailable to obtain weights from preference statements so that for any set of preferences a \nnumber of different weight sets can be found depending on the method used. Cognitive limits \nlead to inconsistency in preference judgements so that weights may be subject both to \nuncertainty and to bias. It is proposed that choosing weights to minimise discrimination \nbetween alternatives (not weights) guards against unjustified discrimination between \nalternatives.  \nApplying the method to data collected by the Financial Times shows the effect of \nvarying the level of discrimination between weights and also the effect of using a reduced \ndata set made necessary by the partial publication of information. \n \n \nKeywords: multicriteria; quadratic programming; performance; MBA. \n \n \n 2 \nA Portfolio Model for Performance Assessment: the Financial Times MBA \nranking. \n \n \nIntroduction \nMeasures of the performance of organisations are commonly used either to initiate some \nimproving changes in the organisation or to provide a guide for those wishing to buy the \ngoods or services produced by it. These evaluations are often presented, however unwisely, as \nrankings or league tables. This is a particular example of the general multicriteria problem of \nselecting a number of alternatives depending on their attributes. A commonly used method is \nto find for each alternative the weighted sum of a number of performance measures or \nattributes:  \n \n yi  =  wjuj(xij)                   (1) \n           \nj \n \nwhere yi is the score of alternative i;  i = 1,2 n \n xij  is the value of attribute j for alternative i;  j = 1,2 m \n uj(.) is a value function chosen so that high values are preferred \n wj   0 is the weight reflecting the importance of or preference for attribute j \n \nand, by convention, \n \n wj = 1        (2) \n  \nj \n \nwhere weights are chosen to encode the judgemental preferences of decision makers. \nIn what follows the function chosen for uj(.) is the familiar z transformation \n \n uj(xij)  = zij  =  (xij - j)\/ j       (3) \n \nwhere j and j  are the mean and standard deviation of the values of X for attribute j. This \nform of value function may be preferred to simply rescaling data for each attribute to the \nrange [0,1] because it is less sensitive to changes in the set of alternatives.  \nIn principle neither the data, X, nor the weights, W, are known precisely \u2013 the first \nbecause of errors of sampling and measurement and the second because of the inescapable \nimprecision imposed by the cognitive limits of those providing preference information. This \npaper describes a reaction to the second problem; uncertainty and bias in weight evaluations. \nIt is to be understood that bias is not meant pejoratively but rather to indicate systematic error. \n 3 \nGiven the cognitive and other difficulties which necessarily attend the elicitation of \npreference statements and which may lead to biased estimates (Borcherding, Schmeer and \nWeber 1995; Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) it is customary to use some form of sensitivity \ntesting to see if plausible variations in weight values might materially alter the result (see, for \nexample, Barron and Schmidt, 1988; Mustajoki et al, 2006). Although these analyses provide \nan effective means of engagement of the user with the problem they do not reduce the \ndesirability of formally incorporating into the structure of the evaluation model measures \nwhich reduce the effects of uncertainty and bias in the derivation of weights. The issue is one \nof justification. In particular, given some preference judgements the method whereby weights \nare found ought not to introduce any more information than is contained in those judgements. \nIt is proposed that the variance of scores is an appropriate measure of discrimination and that \nthe effect of information is to increase its value. \nMost evaluations receive no great publicity but of those that do the rankings which are \nroutinely published of business schools and MBA programmes attract much attention. The \ndata used by one of these, that provided by the Financial Times, is used here to demonstrate \nthe derivation of minimally biased evaluations. \nThe paper is organised as follows: a method for guarding against bias is proposed; \nfollowing a brief discussion of MBA rankings and some of the issues which surround them \nthe data used in this paper are given; finally, the method is applied and the results discussed. \n \nA portfolio model \nIn making an evaluation weights are determined based on some preference information. It is \nusually the case that fitting weights to these judgemental data is a problem with positive \ndegrees of freedom and so there exist no unique weights, only those which are optimal \naccording to some criterion. In multicriteria analyses the motivation is often to maximise \ndiscrimination (e.g. Green and Doyle, 1995) by choosing weights which give maximum \ndifferences between scores. But is this right? \nThe all too human desire to differentiate, to be decisive, can result in seeing differences \nwhere none are justified. Using methods which guard against this unjustified attribution of \ndifferences is therefore desirable. A similar concern arises in deciding probability \ndistributions: that the probabilities are selected, unwittingly or not, in a way which biases the \nresult towards a particular outcome. To guard against the effects of this bias Jaynes (1957) \nargued that a distribution should be sought which is minimally discriminating between the \nprobabilities of alternative values of a variable. He did this by maximising the entropy of that \ndistribution, - piln(pi), to give a distribution which is as flat as is consistent with any stated \nconditions which are to be respected. There remains the issue of just how such conditions (of \nmean and variance, for instance) are given: if firmly based on data there are no difficulties but \n 4 \nif they are  to some degree subjective they may themselves be prone to bias. Jaynes (2003, \np373) is quite clear on this; he believes that distributions may be found via the entropy \nmaximising formalism only if conditions are specified as a result of what is known, not what \nis believed (he was no subjectivist). However, even if conditions are to some degree the result \nof judgement, the maximum entropy formalism does ensure that, given those conditions, the \nmeans whereby probabilities are subsequently derived induces no further bias.  \nIn multicriteria evaluation the task is to find weights rather than probabilities, but the \nsame considerations hold (Jessop, 1999) and maximum entropy methods have been used to \nfind weights by maximising the entropy of the weight distribution (Barron and Schmidt, 1988; \nGabbert and Brown, 1989; Soofi, 1990; Soofi and Retzer, 1992) . The conditions imposed \nmay be that it is desirable to have weights which are close to some initial distribution or that \nweights should stay within some stated bounds or both.  \nThe entropy of weights, - wiln(wi), is not the only measure of the flatness of a \ndistribution, the variance,  \n \n w\n2 \n =  ( wi\u00b2  -  1\/m ) \/ m        (4) \n                \ni  \n \nbeing an obvious alternative. The sum wi\u00b2, is a related measure used for the analysis of the \nconcentration of market shares (Herfindahl OC, 1950; Hirschman, 1964) and of species \ndiversity (Simpson, 1949). When the mean is unaltered by the distribution of weights, as here \nbecause of (3), optimising this index is effectively the same as optimising variance. Theil \n(1972) discusses some differences between the Herfindahl-Hirschman index and entropy. An \nexample by Jessop (2004) of the application of both to a multicriteria problem shows that the \nresults obtained are very similar (see also Breiman et al, 1998, ch 4). It is therefore \nreasonable to use variance as a measure of the flatness of a distribution and to minimise \nvariance as a way of ensuring that weights contain no more information than is implicit in \nwhatever constraints are set which encode the judgements of the decision maker. But first it is \nnecessary to decide just what one should be minimally discriminating about. It perhaps seems \ntoo obvious to state that we wish to be minimally discriminating between attributes and so to \nchoose a set of weights which reflects this. The flattest (most uniform) set of weights is one \nfor which the variance (4) is minimised subject to (2) and any other constraints which encode \nstatements of preference. With no such extra constraints this gives a uniform distribution of \nweights ( w\n2 \n =  0).  \nHowever, the purpose of the model is to assess the performance of alternatives and not \nto investigate weight distributions per se. Weights are a means to an end: it is the scores, Y, \nand the discrimination between alternatives which they permit, which are important and so we \n 5 \nwish to minimise the effects of unwanted biases in weight assessment inasmuch as they effect \nthese scores. This is done by minimising the variance of the scores. The variance may be \nexpressed to emphasise the underlying structure of the problem as  \n \n y\n2\n  =     wi wj ij                       (5) \n            \ni     j \n \nwhere ij is the covariance between the values of uj(.) for pairs of attributes i and j ( ii = i\n2\n  is \nthe variance of the attribute i). This is just the model for the estimation of portfolio risk due to \nMarkowitz (1952) in which the weights are proportions invested in different stocks and the \ncovariance matrix describes the relation between the returns from pairs of stocks. In a \nmulticriteria model  the covariance describes the degree to which performance against \ndifferent criteria are correlated. Because of (3) i\n2\n = 1 and so (5) may be rewritten as \n \n                                             n-1       n \n y\n2\n  =  wi\u00b2  +  2       wi wj ij                     (6) \n             \ni                        i=1     j=i+1 \n \nIt is clear that when minimising y\n2\n the resulting weights are a compromise between those \nneeded to minimise the variance of the weight distribution and those which best exploit the \nstructure in the data by using the covariances. If there is no structure in the performance \nmatrix, X, the performance measured by one attribute is unrelated to performance measured \nby any other ( ij = 0; i j) so that  minimising y\n2\n will be the same as minimising w\n2\n. This is \nunlikely.  \nGiven the importance which is often attached to published rankings of performance the \nattribution of differences is a matter of some practical moment, hence the need for well-\nfounded evaluations. The ranking of MBA programmes is a case in point. \nThe various rankings and their importance both to business schools and their clients are \noutlined below. While the data gathered in these exercises are of value for the information \nthey provide it is the aggregation of the data into rankings which receives the greater \nattention, as intended by the newspapers and magazines which publish them. Any such \naggregation depends on decisions made about the relative importance of performance \nmeasures \u2013 weights \u2013 so that those schools not ranked as highly as they believe is their due \nsee that the source of the perceived injustice is that the weights describe a set of values not \nshared by the school. This is inevitable if a single aggregate measure is to be constructed. But \nit is not the weights themselves but rather the discrimination implied by the rankings which is \ncontentious and this raises two questions: first, why are results published ordinally as ranks \n(certainly in the example used in this paper) rather than as scores and, second, is the \n 6 \ndifference in scores between any two schools large enough to justify the conclusion that one \nis inferior to the other, as different ranks do? About the first question one can only speculate \nthat the motivation lies with the interests of the publisher. A partial response to the second \nquestion is that however the results are given it will help in their acceptance by schools and \nothers if the scores are as fair as possible given the nature of the exercise and that part of this \nfairness is that the method should not unreasonably differentiate between schools. Using the \nportfolio model to minimise the variance of the scores does this. \n \nMBA rankings \nThe performance of MBA programmes has been examined from the point of view of their \nrelative strategic positions (Mar-Molinero and Mingers, 2007; Paucar-Caceres and Thorpe, \n2005; Segev et al, 1999) and their efficiencies as determined by frontier analyses such as \nDEA (Colbert, Levary and Shaner, 2000). However,  it is the published rankings which \nreceive most attention, not least by business schools themselves. While it may be thought that \nbusiness schools would welcome the publicity the very existence of the rankings  induces \nbehaviours which may be unintended and, perhaps, undesirable (Policano, 2005). Although \nthe evaluations are usually aimed just at MBA programmes applicants may use rankings as a \nproxy for reputation and prestige both of the programme and the school (Engwall, 2007).  \nSiemens et al (2005) cite the findings of Dichev (1999) that there exists some \nunreliability in rankings which is likely to be due to errors in the data. Peters (2007), in \nsummarising critiques of the ranking methodology, cites response rates from alumni, on \nwhich evaluations are based, as low as one percent. Such poor sampling undermines even \nthose claims of data collection advanced in defence of rankings. Fortunately, the data used \nhere are unlikely to be so flawed since the FT data are audited by KPMG, the only such data \nto be audited (Bradshaw, 2007).  \nThese are not trivial matters. For instance, Peters (2007) cites large increases in the \nnumber of applicants enjoyed by schools following improvements in their ranking. Other \nclaims for rankings, for instance that they \u201care another important measure of customer \nsatisfaction\u201d (Thomas, 2007), also rely on defensible data collection and ranking \nmethodology. Recognising the practical importance of published rankings Bickerstaffe and \nRidgers (2007) give as one of the benefits that they have resulted in the accumulation of many \ndata on which applicants and recruiters may in part base their decisions. The FT website \nprovides the facility for the data to be used in just this sensible way.  \nThese and other current issues concerning business schools and rankings were \nexamined in a recent issue of the Journal of Management Development (volume 26, no. 1, \n2007). \n 7 \nIt should be borne in mind that any ranking reflects the view of the publisher and that \nthis is articulated mainly in the choice of variables. For example, the MBA ranking provided \nby The Economist Intelligence Unit uses thirteen variables with a much greater emphasis on \ncareer support, networking opportunities and the like than the FT. The methodology is the \nsame for both but the results quite different. It is not the case that one is superior to the other, \njust that they reflect different views. Similarly, with university rankings, those given by The \nTimes, The Guardian and The Independent are concerned with UK universities and all include \nstaff-student ratio, entry standards, some measure of expenditure per student and degree \nclassification. They also have one or two measures of student satisfaction. The Higher, on the \nother hand, considers universities worldwide and uses six variables two of which, peer review \nand employer review, reflect constituencies of a very different kind than the usual relation \nbetween university and student. To the extent that these views may not be well founded the \nresult is unreliable, although the views of peers may be useful to career academics when \nconsidering a job move and those of employers of more than passing interest to students. \nHowever well or ill founded the views of, say, employers may be they are their views and \npresumably condition the decisions made on recruitment. Provided that the data collection \nprocess is not flawed the user of the data (though not necessarily of the ranking) needs to be \nclear what variables are used and how important they are. It is not the case that because \ndifferent rankings do not agree that their results are invalid, rather that one needs to be clear \nabout what they measure. \n \nThe data \nThe ranking of the top 100 full-time MBA programmes worldwide published by the Financial \nTimes on 29 January 2007 is used to illustrate the application of the portfolio model. Data \nwere collected from each school and from a sample of its alumni. Performance was assessed \nusing twenty attributes. Details of the measures used and the collection of data are given in \nthe newspaper. Table 1 shows the attributes and, in column a, the weights which were used. \nAggregation to obtain an overall score uses the method described above in (1) to (3).  \nIt is a peculiarity of the published tables that while data are provided for twelve \nattributes the remaining eight are given only as ranks. This makes it impossible to replicate \nthe FT calculations. To make some use of the data either the ranks may be taken as real values \nor the eight ranked attributes may be omitted. There seems to be a small advantage in favour \nof the reduced set in that it is at least possible to have some confidence in the data used rather \nthan having to misrepresent ordinal data. The purpose here is to use an illustration rather than \nto provide a detailed re-examination of the calculations made by the newspaper. Column b of \nTable 1 shows the weights for the reduced set scaled to sum to 1. \n 8 \nIt is worth noting that using (3) means that the worse and best performing alternatives \nwill generally have different scaled values for each attribute. This is shown in Figure 1. \nExtremely good performance is rewarded not just because it is the best of the group but \nbecause it is comparatively rare. For example, the programme with highest alumni salaries is \nscored more than twice as highly as that with the highest percentage of alumni employed at \nthree months. There is an analogous penalty regime for particularly poor performance. \n \nResults \nJudgemental input can take the form of either ranges for weights or a preferred ordering or \nboth. To illustrate the effects of imposing a preference ordering the FT scheme  \n \n w1,w2 > w3 > w4 , w5 > w6 > w7, w8,w9 w10,w11 > w12     (7) \n \nwas used as a base. The required differentiation between the six groups of weights was \nspecified by setting the minimum difference between weights as a fraction of the higher, (wi-\nwj) > a.wi or \n \n (1-a)wi - wj > 0          (8) \n \nwhere wi and wj are in adjacent groups in (7) and wi > wj. Using these sixteen constraints and \n(2) and minimising y\n2\n using (5) and the covariances shown in the upper half of Table 2 gives \na quadratic programme which finds a set of weights and thereby scores on which a ranking \nmay be based. Values a=0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 were used. Three other models were calculated for \ncomparison: that minimising y\n2\n without weight constraints (8); uniform weights minimising \nw\n2\n; the FT weights shown in column b of Table 1. The results are shown in Tables 3 and 4 \nand Figure 2.  It is notable that the weakly ordered weights and the FT weights (C to F) give \nhighly correlated values of y and w (Figure 2), showing that requiring a greater \ndifferentiation between weights necessarily increases the spread of scores and so the \ndifferentiation between alternatives. In addition, as a increases the weights more closely \nresemble the FT weights (Table 4). The weights E derived when a=0.4 are very similar to \nthose given by the FT, though this requirement is much less onerous than having to give point \nestimates for the weights. The weights within each group in (7) are the same although this \nwas not a requirement; the constraints only specified the ordering with respect to weights in \nan adjacent group. \nFigure 3 shows distributions of scores for those models which minimise y\n2\n and for the \nFT weights. Although the interquartile range does not change much the scores of the higher \nscoring schools become more attenuated as the weights are increasingly differentiated. The \n 9 \ndistributions of attribute values generally exhibit some skew (Table 1, column c): attributes 3 \nand 7 notably negative; 1, 4, 10, 11 and 12 notably positive. It might be expected that the \naggregation to form an overall score would mean that score distributions tend to Normality. In \ngeneral they do in that the skew is much reduced (Table 3) though it becomes increasingly \npositive as weights are more constrained. Although results C and D are not significantly \ndifferent from Normal (Kolmogorov-Smirnoff and Shapiro-Wilk tests with 5% significance \nlevel) the others are. Figure 4 shows an example. Weights increasingly favour the two \nvariables describing alumni income, both of which have a positive skew, so that the \ndistribution of scores itself shows increasingly positive skew.  \nThe extreme outlier at the low end of the rankings in C to E is much less pronounced \nwith the FT weights F. This outlier is the programme with the extremely low z value of -6.8 \nfor attribute 3 (Figure 1). Comparing the E and F weights (Table 4) shows similar values for \nall except w3, which is only half the value in F that it is in E. This accounts for the improved \nperformance. \nTable 5 shows the top ten programmes in all six evaluations. Of those evaluations with \nweight constraints (C to F) seven programmes appear in all four lists. It would seem that \nintroducing just a little preference information gives a base structure to the evaluation which \ndoes not change that much as the constraints become more prescriptive. This is also shown by \nthe correlations in Table 6. The correlation between the equal weights and FT weights (A and \nF) is particularly poor. Policano (2007) found this same result in his analysis of the US News \nranking. The correlations between the base model, min y\n2\n, with no weight constraints (B) and \nother models are poor. It is not surprising that results with an increasingly sharp articulation \nof a preference structure should be dissimilar to that with none. The value of B is that it \nestablishes an unconstrained minimum for y\n2\n against which others may be compared. \n \nA comment on the 2008 data \nThe rankings for 2008 were published on January 28th. The resulting correlations are shown \nin the lower half of Table 2. A full comparison with the 2007 data  is not possible because \nvariable 6, aims achieved, was given as a rank rather than a percentage and so correlations \nwith this variable cannot be calculated. This treatment is odd; aims achieved  was also given \nas a rank in 2003 and 2004 but not before then nor between 2005 and 2007. In 2001 only six \nof the twenty variables were given indirectly (as scaled indices rather than ranks) whereas \nnow it is nine. It would be interesting to know why this is so. \nAlthough calculations similar to those for 2007 are not possible it can be seen from (6) \nthat if the covariances (and so correlations) are not dissimilar neither will be the resulting \nvalue of y\n2\n. Figure 5 shows a graphical comparison from which it can be seen that the \n 10 \nstructural relations between variables have not changed much and so neither would the result \nbe expected to change much either. \n \nClusters and gaps \nThe purpose of an analysis is to determine which programmes have performance levels \nsimilar to that of others: scores have value only inasmuch as they distinguish between \nalternatives. A ranking is just an extreme application of this idea. Making these distinctions is \ndifficult for two reasons. First, because the model (1) reduces a multidimensional description \nof each alternative to a single figure, the score. Had this not been done some form of cluster \nanalysis would find groups of programmes which had similar form, similar profiles of \nperformance across their vectors of attributes. Second, had the uncertainty due to sampling or \ndue to weight specification or both been described statistically then the resulting probabilistic \nestimate of each score could be expressed as a confidence interval and statistically significant \ndifferences between scores found. Groups of statistically similar alternatives might then be \nformed, though the result  may be just a set of overlapping confidence intervals (The Royal \nStatistical Society, 2003) rather than clusters. This would still make it possible to say, for \ninstance, that an alternative ranked fifth has a score significantly different from that ranked \nthirty fifth even though it is not possible to differentiate between alternatives which are \nadjacent or close. This is an important idea. \nAlthough neither approach is used in published rankings, the inability perfectly to \ndiscriminate is recognised. For example, the FT, in its ranking, identifies four groups: 16 in \nthe topmost group and then groups of 16, 21 and 47. (It has to be said that these groupings are \nnot apparent in the analyses here and so must depend on the variables which were excluded \nfrom this analysis.) Given that the distribution of scores is a positively skewed continuum \n(hence the increasing size of the groups) it is unsurprising that the differences between \nprogrammes in the low density tail tend to be greater than those in the higher density body, \nbut to say that these larger differences are significant or remarkable leads to an inconsistency. \nFor example,  in the FT rankings it must surely be the case that the gap in scores between, \nsay, the  programmes ranked 60 and 80 is at least as big as that between the programmes \nranked 53 and 54, yet the latter gap is seen as in some sense significant while programmes 60 \nand 80 are part of an undifferentiated group. The argument \u2013 that if neighbours in a chain \ncannot be differentiated then no two members of the chain can be differentiated \u2013 is \nreminiscent of an incremental reasoning with roots in antiquity (see, for instance, Barnes, \n1982). It is an argument which is hard to support.  \nMBA rankings will remain. They appear simple and many find them useful. The \npurpose here was not to examine rankings but only to describe a method which could be of \nuse in finding the weights which they, and others, might use. \n 11 \n \n \nConclusion \nThis paper is concerned with finding a set of weights which are a justifiable articulation of the \njudgements implicit in making a ranking. Taking the broadly statistical view of the portfolio \nmodel shows clearly the relation between the information contained in the weights and in the \nscores on which ranks are based. Given the imprecision inherent in any expression of \npreference it is important to guard against undue discrimination between alternatives. It is this \nfocus on results (scores) rather than on the weights themselves which is the basis of this \nmethod. \nWeights are seen as expressions of priority so that, at least, a rank ordering of weights \nis possible. Using this as a constraint in an optimisation which enforces caution reconciles \napparently conflicting requirements: to be opinionated and yet to reach minimally biased \nconclusions.  \nIt is the rank order of weights and the relative differences between them which largely \ndetermine the result. As Table 4 shows, the greater this relative difference the more the \nminimally discriminating weights resemble the FT weights. Even so, the results obtained \n(Table 5) are different from those found by the FT. The ranking of the top ten using the \nreduced data set but FT weights (result set F) contains eight of the FT top ten, but even using \na small relative difference between weights (C) it contains six. It is the information contained \nin the unrecoverable eight variables that makes the difference. \nIt is usual (though not in published rankings) that weights may be altered in a \nsensitivity analysis to see the effects of  imprecision and whether plausible differences in \nweights have a large effect. It would certainly be helpful if some such results could be \npublished so that real differences in performance could reliably be identified. In recognition \nof the problem most publications contain some statement to the effect that differences \nbetween scores may not be significant. Further analysis would, of course, undermine the \nexisting simple ranking and it is easy to see why newspapers and magazines would not find \nthis helpful.  \nThe success of the multicriteria model is due in part to its modularity. This enables \nusers to consider sub-problems rather than the whole so that the elicitation of weights is a task \nthe results of which are used in computing scores. In this framework weights may assume an \nunnecessary importance. Finding weights which minimise the variance of scores goes some \nway to reintegrating the modular framework. The same set of judgemental constraints will \ngive different weights with a different problem. This seems odd only if the weights \nthemselves are invested with a significance other than their role of encoding judgements: it is \nthe judgements themselves and the results which are key. In particular, the problem provides \n 12 \nthe context in which the judgements are articulated as numbers: changing the context will \nchange the numbers while retaining the judgements. \nEvaluations must be believed, at least to the extent that they act as a guide. Using a \nmethod which minimises the effects of bias helps to justify the analysis. The consumer of the \nresults ought to be reassured that the method of calculation does not itself contribute to \napparently significant (important, at least) results but rather that all the information contained \nin the scores is a function of preference statements and data and nothing else.   \n \n \nReferences \nBarnes J (1982).
