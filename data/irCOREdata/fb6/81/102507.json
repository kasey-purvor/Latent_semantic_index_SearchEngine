The \nheterogeneity of actors refers to business organisations, individuals within them, institutions, \ntechnologies and other artefacts that participate in the development of business projects, or in \nsupplier networks. A business project is considered to be any business activity related to \nproduction, distribution, or accumulation of resources, including tangible and intangible assets, \nknowledge, shared meaning and values. \n \nThe paper attempts to conceptualise also the heterogeneity of processes in business networks, \nsuch as: enrolment and network construction, \u2018translation\u2019 and the normative activities within \nnetworks, competition, co-operation, selection and \u2018displacement\u2019 of other members, as well as \nrepositioning through strategic behaviour. This intra-organisational dynamics is analysed in the \ncontext of structural characteristics of the network, such as: configuration, size, density, \ncohesion, connectedness, range, multiplexity, and heterogeneity, structural autonomy, structural \nequivalence, and the division of labour within business networks. \n \nThe intra-organisational dynamics in our analysis emerges as a result of all co-operative and \ncompetitive efforts of the network members in fulfilling their contracts and pursuing their \ninterests. The relational dynamics within networks is determined therefore by the position of the \nactors, by the contracts between them, by their individual interests and preferences, and their \nknowledge of the preferences of the others. \n \nThe endogenous structural characteristics of the network not only determine the network \ndynamics, but lead to self-regulation and self-coordination activities, that increase further the \ndivision of labour within a business network.  \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe explanatory power of heterogeneous systems is in their capacity to represent complex and \nasymmetric processes between inter-linked elements. We have to stress from the beginning, that \nthe conceptualisation of systems, or networks is by definition a reduction of the reality of \ninterconnectedness and multi-directional influences between actors and entities that constitute a \nnetwork. Any conceptualisation of a network is a reduction of reality, and it is a subjective \ninterpretation, an outcome of the interpretative activity of human agents. The purpose of our \ntheoretical analysis is to discuss the nature and the sources of heterogeneity in network systems \nin the context of both the interpretative and the structuralist paradigm in social sciences, and \n 2\nparticularly the work by Burt and Callon. We will look at the nature of heterogeneous actors and \nheterogeneous processes in networks, the strategic behaviour of different actors, and its effect on \nthe network configuration and on the dynamic process of structuration of relationships. \n \nOne of the fundamental barriers to network analysis is the duality of the nature of networks - \nbeing simultaneously socio-economic structures as well as dynamic processes of exchanges and \ntransactions between partners. The structuralist paradigm attempts to define basic assumptions \nthat explain how network members are linked together and how these ties facilitate exchange of \nresources of any kind. However, this analysis is of limited value to practising managers who \nneed not only to construct relations in the real business world, but also to fill these relationships \nwith content, to make decisions regarding value, payments, and benefits from transactions.  \n \nThe analysis of the content of network relations requires much more holistic approach - as \napplied in social anthropology (Buckley and Chapman, 1996). According to the interpretative \nparadigm, the content of a relation is determined by the two partners involved in it, their \nattributes and their interests, and the way they perceive each other, reflect upon the situation, and \nframe the transaction by selections and choices. Both actors usually define their individual \ninterests, strategies, and exchange information about their intentions. The contract between two \nactors evolves as a negotiated strategy for mutual co-operation, supported by framed \nexpectations and formal agreements. The content of the relationship therefore includes: a) the \nindividual intentions of each partner, b) the negotiated strategy between them, and c) the \nexchange or the transaction itself. This complexity requires a more in-depth analysis of the set of \nrelations for each actor, rather than merely mapping existing structural links. We see therefore, \nthe relational approach to network analysis as complementary to the well established structural \napproach. This paper aims to build upon both structural and relational paradigms, and to throw \nsome light on the underlying processes within two types of business networks \u2013 supplier \nnetworks, and project networks. They are described in the following part as examples of business \nnetwork structures. \n \nThe existing research on networks puts emphasis on three aspects - the \u2018nodes\u2019 (identified as the \nactors), the ties and relations (measured mainly through reciprocity, directionality, content and \nmultiplexity), and the overall network configuration. Further in our paper we discuss in more \ndetails the concepts, categories and indcators used for theoretical reflexions and empirical \ninvestigation of business networks, and we look at the heterogeneous nature of the actors and \ntheir relationships.  \n \nTHE CONCEPT OF NETWORK AND NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS \n \nThe use of the word \u2018network\u2019 spreads over a range of phenomena. The main examples are: a) a \ncommunication net (as in telecommunications); b) interconnected desktops, or technical \noperational devices for information processing (as in computer network); c) a social structure of \nties, facilitating relations and exchanges between individual actors (as in a social network); d) \ninterrelated economic agents involved in a repetitive exchange of products, services, market \ninformation, and economic benefits and payments (as in business network). What is in common \nbetween these four distinctive conceptualisations of the term \u2018network\u2019 is that they all refer to a \n 3\nformation which facilitates exchanges of information, goods, resources, individual affection, \nemotions values, meaning and commitment between its members. \n \nEach discipline dealing with these phenomena has made its own attempt to define the term. \nHowever, the concept remains a nebulous linguistic structure, inclusive of almost any intended \nmeaning, and used in a metaphorical way. Thompson (1991, p. 173) introduces the idea of \nnetworks as \u2018means of co-ordination\u2019 of social life, without specifying how this co-ordination is \nconducted, or by whom. If self-co-ordination is assumed, than it is not clear how a network \nstructure facilitates this, or how network members participate in it.  \n \nReference is made to a definition by Mitchell (1969) viewing \u2018network\u2019 as a specific type of \nrelation, linking a defined set of persons, objects or events (in: Knoke and Kuklinski, 1982). \nFrom this definition it is not very clear what is the reason (or the purpose) of this linking, and \nhow the links between these persons, objects and events differ from a set of relationships \nestablished in a formal organisational structure. This definition also, does not specify how \nnetwork boundaries are treated. Research on social networks, for example, emphasises that one \nof the features that distinguish networks from organisations is that the boundaries of the former \nare flexible and dynamic. Another difference between the two concepts of organisations and \nnetworks derives from the purpose of their establishment. The former is conceived with a clear \npurpose, while the latter appears to serve multi-directional and, in many cases, contradictory \naims.  \n \nEach network maintains limited resources, and different members have different access to these \nresources. It seams evident, that the unique feature of networks is that they accommodate \ninequality within their boundaries, which fuels specific network dynamics.  \n \nIn review of these critical comments, our definition for networks is the following: \n \nNetworks are sets of transactions based on structural formations with dynamic \nboundaries that comprise of interconnected elements\/members; Networks \naccommodate the contradictory aims pursued by each member, and facilitate \nrepetitive exchanges that have specific directionality and flow of information, \ngoods, heterogeneous resources, individual affection, commitment and trust \nbetween the network members. \n \nThe characteristics of a network could be grouped in three main categories - characteristics of \nthe nodes\/ members, characteristics of the relationships between members, and characteristics \nof the overall network structure (Nohria and Eccles, 1992, Knoke and Guilarte, 1994). Our map \nof the concepts that are used in the literature to define a business network is presented in Fig. 1.   \n\u2022 Characteristics of the \u2018nodes\u2019 \nThis category includes all measurements and characteristics that describe: the actors (agents, or \nmember) of a network; the direct vs. indirect contacts between them (in terms of type of \nexchange); and the centrality of one or more of the actors (in terms of their capacity to receive or \nsend a disproportionate amount of relations with others; their capacity to connect all others and \ntherefore making them dependent, or their capacity to determine the minimal number of steps \n 4\nneeded for one to connect to all other network members). In addition to these structural \nproperties of the actors, there are a number of individual properties that affect their behaviour, \nand how they engage in network relationships and transactions. Examples of individual \nproperties (or characteristics and attributes) of the actors are: size and history of the firm, \nownership and corporate governance structure, assets and accumulated resources (including \nknowledge, capital and market access), interests, values, and expectations. The heterogeneity of \nthe actors stems mainly from their individual characteristics, as well as from previously \nestablished relations and presence in varios organisational configurations.  \n \nFig. 1. Network Characteristics \n \n    \n\u2022 Characteristics of the relations between network members  \n \nThis group of characteristics includes the following categories introduced by network analysts: \ncontent, multiplexity, directionality, transitivity and intensity of the links between network \nmembers; reciprocity, or relational symmetry experienced by individual members; incoming vs. \noutgoing relations in terms of the pattern of activity - sending or receiving links; relations and \nexchanges with the environment, particularly important for channelled and repetitive exchanges \nlike inputs, or realisation of outputs; and the competition between network members for the \nresources available in a specific network configuration. Most of these characteristics are \noperationalised as measurements, particularly used in social network analysis. The \noperationalisation of business relationships in this context has not benefited much from this \nresearch experience. While contract relationships are not difficult to analyse, there are \ninsufficient attempts to classify business relationships for the purpose of network analysis. \n \n\u2022 Characteristics of the entire network structure  \n \nA number of characteristics are included in this analytical perspective of social network analysis: \nthe spatial configuration of individual positions; structure; connectedness; hierarchy and \nA\nB\nC D\nCENTRALITY\ndirectionality\nA2\nincoming ties\ncompetition\noutgoing\nties\ncontent\nexchanges \nwith the\nenvironment\nconfiguration\nsize\ndensity\ncliques\ncontrol centres\nstructural equivalence \n    between positions\nDIRECT vs.\nINDIRECT\nCONTACTS\nintensity\nreciprocity\ncohesion\nmultiplexity\nCAPACITY TO\n CONNECT\nSIZE, HISTORY, GOVERNANCE,\nINTERESTS, EXPECTATIONS\n 5\nefficiency (Krackhard, 1994); the formation of cliques; social circles; power; and control \ncentres; the overall size of the network (measured in terms of the number of participants in it); \nnetwork density (measured by the proximity in roles and positions of different members); \nstructural equivalence between positions (in terms of responsibilities and influence); and the \nsocial cohesion between the actors (in terms of shared beliefs, values and understanding). These \ncharacteristics are enlisted outside of the main circle, which resembles the boundaries of our \nhypothetical network model.  \n \nIn our theoretical discussion further we will use examples of 2 types of business networks: a) a \nsupplier network; and b) a project network. If we look at a supplier chain of a firm as a business \nnetwork, while all partners are interested in completing the exchange (a common aim), all of \nthem negotiate individual outcomes and try to maximise the benefits that this exchange brings to \nthem (contradictory aims). Trust in fulfilling the obligations, repetitiveness of the transactions, \nand mutual adaptations between interlinked firms and agents is what constitutes the set of \nnetwork relations. Re-negotiation of benefits in a supplier network occasionaly takes place. \nUsually transactions are supported by contracts, or mutual agreements based on expected and \nknown outcomes. Project networks on the contrary are constructed on the basis of investments \nwith unknow outcomes. Participants in project networks are selected as contributors and \ninvestors with designated roles in order to produce target outputs. \n \nThe example of a business project is taken from the detailed analysis by Callon (1986) of the \nconstruction of an electric vehicle for public service in France (VEL). Such a project requires \nemployment of heterogeneous actors and entities. However, we have to be careful how we \ndescribe these different types of actors. The project itself is an institution that has specific aims \nand limited resources (including knowledge), and utilises a variety of economic, social and \nscientific agents such as firms, consumer associations, laboratories, government bodies, \ntechnologies, physical artefacts and documentation. These agents are either institutions that \nrepresent different interests, or non-human elements that are employed for a particular utility \nfunction. A firm, such as Renault in Callon\u2019s example, is a specific institution that represents the \nbusiness interests of its owners, employees, shareholders, and the wider range of stakeholders. \nThe particular institutional form, and the specific bundle of interests of all stakeholders makes \nRenault different from EDF (Electricite de France), which is a government body, empowered to \nlaunch the project for the construction of an electric vehicle for public service in France.  \n \nEDF as a public institution is one of the key agents that drives the selection of the other network \nmembers, and the construction and development of the heterogeneous network of economic and \nscientific actors. In our analysis further both the supplier network and the EDF project will be \nused to illustrate the processes that take place within heterogeneous business networks.  \n \nAt a micro level the project includes technical and managerial staff, pieces of knowledge and \ntechnology (such as electrons, fuel cells, accumulator, electrodes, catalysts) and other material \nobjects and non-human agents that represent embodiments of human knowledge, human \ndecisions, human selections and choices, human subjectification of material objects, and human \ninterests.  \n \n 6\nThe advancement of network analysis has taken place mainly under the structuralist paradigm \nwith empirical studies of social and communication networks. Leading in the field is the work by \nKnoke and Kuklinski (1982) on network analysis; Wellman & Berkowitz (1988) on social \nstructures; Monge and Eisenberg (1987) on the traditions in communication networks; Nohria \nand Eccles (1992) on structure, form, and action within networks; Krackhardt, 1992  on the \nstrength of strong ties; Wasserman and Faust (1994) on social network analysis. Within the \nstructural paradigm three closely linked traditions evolved \u2013 the positional tradition, extended by \nBurt\u2019s structural hole theory; the relational tradition, developed particularly with the research at \nUPSALA on supplier networks; and the cultural tradition, represented by the work of Latour \n(1987) and Callon (1986, 1991). \n \nOne of the advancements made by the structural analysis theory is to recognise the \nembeddedness of market transactions in the structure of social relations. However, the practical \nconsequences of that fact remain hidden in implicit assumptions about network ties, positions, \nand relations of the actors in hierarchical and network structures. In addition some managerial \ntheories have focused on issues of actor\u2019s choices and strategies. Mintzberg\u2019s work (1983) on \nintra- and inter-organisational power relations, and Porter\u2019s theory of competitive advantage built \nby organisations through extending their control over the value chain and the value system \n(Porter, 1991) are some of the leading conceptual frameworks that can explain relations of power \nand dominance between interlinked agents. \n \nIn a recent work on choices and selection Paolo Ramazzotti and Marco Rangone (2000) conclude \nthat the behaviour of the actors (purposive or not) affects the selection mechanism via learning \nand knowledge creation. Therefor, the interaction of actors in a network modifies the very \nframework for interpretation of market information in a network. They also confirm that key \nmarket players affect customer preferences and decisions which undermines the very principle of \nautonomous selection, and is another example of embededness of business transactions. \n \n \nHETEROGENEITY OF ACTORS \n \nThe literature on business networks usually refers to companies as the main agents and members \nof a network configuration. While there is no doubt that behind each firm stands a management \nteam, composed by professionals in their own field, the literature is still dominated by the neo-\nclassical assumptions of the firm as the main actor, as well as the homogeneity of actors in a \nmarket place.  \n \nIn a supplier network the difference between the firm which supplies with components and \nservices, and the firm which procures them is not merely a distinction between a buyer and a \nseller. The dyadic relationship is usually mediated by contracts and conventions, and by a set of \nintermediaries, offering legal, financial, or other business services. These intermediaries are not \nconsidered as crucial actors in a traditional analysis of economic transactions. They are, \nhowever, not merely elements of the external business environment, but intrinsic components \nconstituting the relationships in a network. We argue that the heterogeneity of actors in a supplier \nnetwork stem from the nature of different agents, their individual properties, the roles they play \n 7\nin the network. This heterogeneity is increasingly in a correspondence with the complexity of \ncontemporary market transactions.  \n \nRegarding project networks, or what Callon calls actor-networks (1986), in addition to the \nvariety of institutional actors and firms, there are fundamental differences between the original \nactors that invent new technologies, instruments and other non-human components, and the new \nactors that employ them for a new purpose. These are different types of actors, with different \ninterests, objectives, intentions, and strategies. These leading human actors are involved in the \nprocess of selection and enrolment of all other institutions, human and non-human actors. \n \nThe heterogeneity of human actors derives from the specific institutional form, which they take, \nfrom their properties, and from their different position in the enrolment process. This means that \ndifferent human actors perform different roles in the process of decision making, resource \nallocation, and \u2018translation\u2019 of the properties of other potential actors (technologies, technical \nartefacts, human beings, skills, money, texts, and other resources) (Callon 1992). \n \nIn Callon\u2019s example, the Ministry \u2013 Electricite de France (EDF) - is a type of institution that \nrepresents the interests of different stakeholders. It is empowered by a Government decision to \nselect and enrol other elements into the project (VEL). The EDF\u2019s knowledge that the car maker \nRenault has the capabilities to perform the required task is crucial in driving their decision to \nascribe to the firm a specific role in the project. The decision to enrol Renault as an actor is made \non behalf of the institution and the institution stands behind the decision. However, institutions, \nor organisations in general have no decision-making capabilities. They are only intermediaries \nthat facilitate the decision-making and the resource allocation process. The actual decision-\nmakers within EDF are individuals, or groups that can be named, and who represent particular \ninterests.  \n \nCallon in his initial definition of \u2018actor-world\u2019 states that actor-world is \u201cthe world of entities \ngenerated by an actor-network\u201d (Callon 1986b, p. xvi). The actor-world is composed of all \nelements and their contexts that they bring to the network. Institutions as actors in an actor-\nnetwork are themselves heterogeneous networks \/ systems of human elements (agents), rules, \nprocedures, and accumulated resources. Important distinction here is the fact that human \ndecisions, made by individuals or groups, are announced (and therefore encrypt) as institutional. \nFor an experienced observer, it should be clear that institutions only represent human interests. \nHowever, it is the human beings that attribute value to objects, and therefore associate interests \nwith these selected objects (such as the development of electric vehicle). \n \nThe two actors already described \u2013 EDF and Renault \u2013 are different in type. They differ in their \naccess to resources, in their position in the decision-making process, concerning the ultimate \npurpose for the project-network \u2013 the construction of the electric vehicle (VEL), in their \nresponsibilities, interests, and commitment to this project. This is what makes the project-\nnetwork heterogeneous.  \n \nIn our analysis further in this paper, we will interpret heterogeneity only in terms of variation \nbetween actors, and more precisely qualitative differences regarding their institutional form, their \n 8\naccess to resources, their interests, their position in the network configuration, and their effect on \nthe decision-making process.  \n \nMost of the research in network analysis has assumed equal properties of the actors. This is a \nfundamental barrier to understanding the behaviour in a network beyond connectedness between \nactors. Two actors act in a dyadic relationship driven by their individual properties, by the \nproperties of the link, and by the overall network properties, including the level of cohesion, \nconnectedness and structural equivalence between positions.  \n \nThe properties of the actors derive from their own constitution, from the relationships they are \nengaged in, and from the attributed characteristics and ascribed roles to them by their relational \npartners. Following this logic we can distinguish not only between buyers and sellers, but also \nbetween different types of buyers and sellers. We can differentiate between a number of other \neconomic actors such as regulatory bodies, national and international institutions and other \nconstituting bodies, technical and managerial staff, technologies, documents and instructions, as \nwell as accumulated resources, particularly in the form of capital and knowledge. \n \nNon-human actors \n \nStrategic action could be only attributed to human and institutional entities in the actor-network. \nOnly human elements could act strategically beyond their individual attributes. All non-human \nelements \u2018act\u2019 only by their presence (as being \u2018enrolled\u2019 in the network), and according to their \nattributes (as employed by the human actors). While Callon suggests that technologies and \nindustrial standards may determine strategies of business actors as far as they are accepted, \nselected by these same actors because of their properties. Once enrolled, technologies and their \ndocumentation do play a significant role, shaping the development of the project. The non-\nhuman elements could also be used by the human actors in a specific way which may look as \nhaving a prescribed role. However, they don\u2019t \u2018perform\u2019 this role, because they don\u2019t \u2018act\u2019 \npurposefully. They are merely employed in the process, or used as a point of reference by the \nhuman actors to acquire more resources, or to achieve other objectives. \n \nThe Power of Contracts \n \nFrom this analysis, it should be clear that the electric vehicle project (VEL) is constructed from a \nrange of heterogeneous actors, and a range of enrolled heterogeneous elements only according to \nthe knowledge and the capabilities of the human beings working on behalf of EDF. While EDF \nappears as a leading actor in the VEL project, the leadership belongs to EDF employees \nresponsible for the interpretation and translation of the interests and the properties of all other \nactors and elements.  \n \nEDF is therefore the contracting agent, but the clauses of the contract, which are used in the \nenrolment process, are textual constructions of the employees, and therefore they are the \nemployees\u2019 inscriptions of the roles, and responsibilities of each other actor and element in the \nnetwork. The employees\u2019 inscriptions represent the way EDF employees interpret and translate \nthe EDF function. The power of these inscriptions derives from the incentives build in the \n 9\ncontract with each other actor in the network such as Renault. Therefore, it is the EDF employees \nthat allocate resources for future performance of all other human and institutional actors.  \n \nOther non-human actors, such as electrons and pieces of technology, could be referred to in the \ncontract, but are not recipients of contracts themselves. The human (individual or institutional) \nactors, through an elaborate process of translation and enrolment directly or indirectly employ \nthe non-human actors. The translation in this case means selection among alternatives, or \nassociation with other human and non-human entities for a specific purpose.  \n \nThe association of technology and other non-human or human entities in an actor-network is not \na spontaneous process. It is directed, controlled, and co-ordinated by the key human actors that \nset up the aims of the network. These leading actors can do this on their own behalf, or on behalf \nof the institutions they represent. They design the contracts with all other players, encrypt \nincentives for performance, allocate resources, actively enrol, translate and associate other \nelements, already accessible to their knowledge. Therefore, of primary interest to network \nanalysis is to identify the key actors in a network, and to deconstruct their strategies and their \ninterests, encrypt in their properties, in their institutional form, in their position in the network (in \nterms of responsibilities, authority, and access to resources), in the contracts they are engaged in, \nand in their current and past decisions. \n \nStructural Autonomy and Individual Attributes \n \nStructural autonomy, according to Burt, is the ability of actors to pursue and realise their \ninterests and to circumvent market constraints (Burt, 1982:265). Structural autonomy derives not \nso much from the position of actors, but from their power and ability to control information and \nresource flow within the network. This power and control may derive both from the status\/role-\nset of the actors, and from their attributes. \n \nFor Burt, structural autonomy is highly correlated with a specific relational pattern (common for \nall occupants of this status), and involves low competition with one-another and high \ncompetition with non-occupant actors, or actors occupying other positions in the network (Burt, \n1982:15). It remains unclear how individual actors make choice to compete vs. to co-operate \nwith other status groups.  \n \nBurt also assumes that occupants of a status have equal control of resources. There are no \nempirical evidence that this assumption is true. Control of resources depends both on the position \nof the actors, and on their individual attributes. Occupants of the same status may have different \ncapabilities to utilise their position. \n \nA contradiction in Burt\u2019s theory is also the statement that occupants of a status have common \ninterests (to the extent they control equally resources  (Burt, 1982:266), and at the same time \nthey are expected to compete for these resources. Competing for the same pool of resources \nmakes them substitutable, and make the relationships with structurally equivalent actors \nredundant. The competition between structurally equivalent actors for control over the same pool \nof resources would exclude by definition any commonality in their behaviour and strategic \n 10\nintentions beyond their efforts to overcome their adversaries, and their mimicry to copy each \nother. \n  \nIf we translate this to the case of supplier networks, competition takes place in specific product \nmarkets or resource markets, and under the conditions of limited resources, or limited buyers. \nCompetition therefore derives from the limited opportunities for realisation of actors' interests, \nrather than directly from the network properties, such as structural autonomy. \n \nNetwork Position and Structural Equivalence \n \nFor Burt actors jointly occupying a position pursue similar structural interest and do not compete \nwith one-another, while simultaneously competing with non-occupants. This certainly is not the \ncase in the context of input-output relations, where all suppliers occupy similar positions, pursue \nsimilar interests, but engage in direct competition for contracts with buyers. Suppliers therefore \ncompete with those occupying similar positions (i.e. other similar suppliers), and co-operate with \nnon-occupants (i.e. buyers). The structural equivalence, therefore, in a supplier network will be a \nmeasure of competition. Larger number of structurally equivalent actors will characterise higher \nlevel of competition in a supplier network. In a project network with designated roles and \nresponsibilities actors with structurally equivalent positions may be both co-operation and \ncompeting for the same pool of resources and more influence over the decision making process. \n \nBurt acknowledges that \u201ca position only constitutes a status when its constituent relations define \nrights and duties uniquely significant within a system\u201d (Burt, 1982: 41). This means simply that \nthe status\/role-set depends on the rules within the network. The logical expectation is that in a \nnetwork, there are rules that associate rights and duties to individual actors according to their \nattributes and the position they occupy within the geodesics of relations. The whole question of \ncompetition vs. co-operation and strategic behaviour of the actors then becomes dependent on \nthe question of network rules and ways of allocation of rights and duties. \n \nBurt makes it clear that one of the assumptions of his model is that \u201cinterests pursued by \noccupants of different statuses are not complementary\u201d (Burt, 1982:286). This fundamentally \ncontradicts with the notion of division of labour, which assumes complementarity between actors \nthat specialise in different points of the input-output chain. If the suppliers have no \ncomplementary interests with the buyers, no transaction could ever take place. Equally important \nis the complementarity between heterogeneous actors in a project network aiming jointly at the \ncompletion of the project. \n \nThe Source of Status-Norms in a Network \n \nEven though as a sociologist Burt stands closer to the side of the normative perspective in \nnetwork analysis, he does not openly reject the atomistic perspective. His attempt to seek \ncomplementarity between alternative scientific paradigms is one of the most admirable features \nof his argument. However, the acceptance of the utility factor as the driving motive for each \nactor is a retreat to the atomistic perspective. Burt admits, that an actor evaluates the utility of an \naction both in regard to his\/her personal conditions and the conditions of the others (Burt, 1982). \nHowever, it remains an individual evaluation of the structural constraints, experienced by each \n 11\nactor in a network. Network rules induce norms of behaviour and prescribe both transactions and \nallocation  of resources beyond the utility function. Individual choices, therefor, are affected both \nby normative prescriptions and utility incentives. \n \nActor\u2019s autonomy is also defined through constraints. For Burt the autonomy of the actors as \noccupants of a status is determined by the extent to which they are capable to realise interests \nwithout, or despite the constraints from others. However, the constraints from others derive from \nthe relationships with them. Burt is not interested how individual actors are capable of affecting \nthe content of their relationships with others in order to diminish the constraints. For the author, \nconstraints are fixed by the status\/role-set, and the structural equivalence position of each actor.  \n \nThis static view of actor\u2019s autonomy does not tell much about the individual strategies that actors \nemploy in their attempts to reposition themselves in a network, to gain more access to resources, \nor to overcome constraints, and to realise their interests. The status of an actor in a network is a \nresult of both the individual strategies employed by this actor, and the effect of all strategies \nemployed by the network members. \n \nNot only the individual strategies disappear from Burt\u2019s structural theory of action, but also the \nnormative aspects of actors\u2019 behaviour. There is almost no discussion of where norms in a \nnetwork derive from. The notion of a norm is reduced to the concept of  \u2018status norm\u2019, and \nmakes no reference to the institutional aspects of conventions, internalised as norms of \nbehaviour. Burt acknowledges that there is an inherited contradiction between his prediction for \noccupants of a status to share a status norm (merely by their equal structural equivalence \nposition) even if they are not connected, and the traditional normative argument, that social \nnorms are a result of strong socialising relations between people who share the norm (Burt, \n1982:14). \n \n \nTHE NETWORK AS A STRUCTURE OF RELATIONSHIPS \n \nBusiness relationships in a network are expressed in forms of transactions between firms, \nexchanges of resources, information and payments between interlinked heterogeneous actors, \nand unilateral strategic and responsive behaviour of the actors themselves. The structure of \nrelationships determines both individual and collective behaviour of network agents. Their \nresponsive behaviour is directly linked to opportunities and threats in their internal and external \nenvironment. At the same time they act strategically with their choices and selections. The \naccumulation of resources by firms and the allocation of these resources for further development \nis a form of strategic positioning within  the set of relationships. \n \nThe strategic behaviour of the actors is also a driving factor for the network design, as well as \nbeing directly influenced by the network structure. Strategic behaviour in a network is a result of \nthe actors being aware of opportunities that exist within the network, and actors being capable of \nemploying these opportunities and utilising the existing resources in their pursue for realisation \nof their interests.  \n \n 12\nIf we return to Callon\u2019s reference to strategic behaviour, it is very clear, that all human elements \nof an actor-network or a project-network could exhibit strategic behaviour. They could be: \ntranslators (ascribing roles to others); spokesmen (representing and speaking on behalf of the \nother enrolled entities); positioning themselves (an actor to render itself indispensable, or to \noblige other entities to detour); displacing others (or creating links and associations between \nentities as obligatory points of passage) (Callon 1986). When the strategic behaviour of actors is \ndriven by complementary interests, the relationship between them takes the shape of co-\noperation. When their interests in the process of allocation of resources become contradictory, \nthe relationship becomes competitive. \n \nIf we look at the non-human elements of a project-network \u2013 they can only perform a specific \nrole ascribed to them by the human actors. However, they can displace other actors through \nconnecting and carrying associations between numerous other entities. For example, in a project \nnetwork the technology may determine not only the enrolment of new actors, pooling in \nresources, but also the exclusion of previous network members on the bases of their limited \ncapabilities to participate in the further development of the project. The decision for this \nselection though is a prerogative of an institutional agency where the purpose and the criteria are \ndetermined by human actors. \n \nThe strategic behaviour of key actors transform the existing and accessible knowledge of the \nproperties of potential network partners, into ascribed roles, encrypt in texts, documents, and \ncontracts. The heterogeneity in this sense means different actors are performing different roles, \ndoing different things, performing specialised tasks within the network. They also extract \ndifferent benefits for themselves according to their interests. Some actors (laboratories) explore \nalternative technical solutions, and therefore they bring more knowledge (i.e. more resources) to \nthe network, and accumulate by themselves more knowledge and intangible assets. Other actors \n(firms) receive \u2018payments\u2019 for their activities, and may use their participation in the existing \nnetwork to develop experience and as a bridge - to enrol to other networks of potential clients. \nThird type of actors (EDF) could use the current network to develop unique expertise and to \nextend their capabilities and their profile (which is part of their identity) in management of \npublic projects. \n \nPurposeful Action \n \nFundamental point in Callon\u2019s actor-network theory is the notion of actors as entities of varying \ntype. By definition the entities are pro-active. They act as a focal point in a network, capable to \nassociate other entities into their actor-world (Callon, 1986). These actor-networks resemble also \nBurt\u2019s Ego-networks - comprised of the leading actors (Egos) that participate in the emergence \nof a network (Burt, 1982). Egos have the capacity to define and construct networks of associated \nelements. This construction activity assumes a purposeful action. Without a purpose, these \nleading entities (or Egos) can only affect other entities (or \u2018Alters\u2019 - agents, technologies, \nresources), but can not prescribe roles and engage these \u2018Alters\u2019 in purposeful activities. It is \nimportant to stress that some activities in a network could be spontaneous, driven by the \nresponsive behaviour of network members. However, the very existence of a network requires a \npurpose, or the collective intentions of inter-linked actors. Otherwise, it is simply an aggregation \n 13\nof actors and entities. The leading actors therefore could only be human, or capable of making \ndecisions and conducting purposeful selections, structuring and translation of roles. \n \nWhile the purposive action is not so explicit for Callon, it is one of the round stones for Burt. \nThe purpose for Burt\u2019s actors is taken to an extreme, almost denying spontaneous activity in the \nnetwork. The social topology as role sets for Burt arises from dyadic relationships, actively \nmanipulated by the network members. The purpose is defined either as intention for an action, or \nas an attribution used by the actor to explain and justify her\/his own behaviour (Burt, 1982).  \n \nThe postulates, that Burt introduces, are: action is purposive, and actors evaluate the marginal \nutility of an action in reference to some criterion, including the social structure as an actor\u2019s \nstatus\/role-set, generated by the division of labour, the actor\u2019s interests, and the action itself. \n(Burt, 1982: 329) The status\/role-set of an actor is therefore a fundamental constituent factor for \nexchanges and building relationships in a network.  \n \nManagerial Choices and Coalition Strategies \n \nThe concept of a status\/role set derives from social network analysis and is applicable to human \nactors. Managers within firms occupy status\/role sets which are constructed by their relationships \nboth within and outside the firm. The concept is applicable to supplier networks, where the \nstatus\/role of the supplier is determined by the length and the conditions of the contract. The \nconcept also assumes homogeneity of suppliers. More difficult is to describe a status\/role set in a \nproject network, where heterogeneous actors are not in a vertical or a horizontal relationship. \nTheir status position is a function of both their choices, and their prescribed role at the initial \nenrolment. \n \nInsights on managerial choices could be found in the work on power in organisations by \nMintzberg (1983) and Pfeffer (1992), and the work on interlocking corporate directorates by Burt \nand Scott (Burt, 1979, Scott, 1987). Mintzberg\u2019s definition of power as \u201cthe capacity to effect (or \naffect) organisational outcomes\u201d (Mintzberg, 1983: 4) suggests that managers purposefully \nconstruct and engage in relationships that secure certain outcomes. They form coalitions in order \nto achieve certain objectives. These coalitions usually aim to ensure that all participants share \nsimilar objectives and similar views on how to achieve them. A collective strategy will obviously \nimprove the efficiency of an action in organisational or network settings. Forming a coalition in \nnetwork analysis is known as formation of cliques, and is seen as having a negative impact on \nthe equality of distribution of information and resources. \n \nTransformation of Identities in a Network \n \nDescribing the negotiated market, Callon asserts that the actors \u201cnegotiate their own identities \nand interests\u201d (Callon 1998: 295). Their identities are both independent properties evolved \nduring their past history and a negotiated outcome of the negotiation process, The institutional \nframework that facilitates the negotiation process, according to Callon, is composed of \n\u2018instruments\u2019 that impose the notion of objectivity of facts upon agents\u2019 subjective viewpoints. It \nis assumed that every member of the network agrees to surrender one\u2019s own subjective \n 14\nviewpoint, and accepts to behave according to agreed scenario. In other words, the identity of an \nactor is constructed institutionally by the agreements of the negotiating parties. \n \nOnly through negotiation and agreements network members ascribe and accept roles. Then they \nperform according to these roles, and act strategically, realising their interests and fulfilling their \ncommitments, accepted within the agreement. Technologies and other non-human actors do not \nparticipate in agreements. They could be subject of these agreements, providing opportunities or \nconstraints for the strategic behaviour of the human actors. \n \n \nHETEROGENEITY OF PROCESSES \n \nIn our analysis, the heterogeneity of the actor-network derives from both heterogeneity of actors \nand heterogeneity of processes.  \n \nCallon (1986) suggests three distinctive processes in a network: \n- enrolment (or allocation of roles) as part of the construction process, when leading actors \ntranslate properties of potential members into roles and functions; \n- the translation process involves the strategies (of the translator), and the selection and  \ndisplacements imposed upon others in the creation of the actor-world; \n- the problematisation, or making oneself indispensable to the network, is a selective process \nof framing of alternative problems, choosing one to solve, and selecting an appropriate \nsolution.  \n \nThe \u2018construction\u2019 process, or what Callon calls \u2018enrolment\u2019 and \u2018translation\u2019 involves a process \nof selection of partners in the network, interpretation of tasks and roles, decisions on values, \nmodes and content of transactions and exchanges. The translation and interpretation of roles and \ninterests requires not only self-awareness of the actor, but also knowledge of the properties of \nthe entities that the actor is trying to enrol. Without self-awareness and knowledge, actors can \nnot have strategies for the process of network construction. They can induce effects on other \nentities by their mere existence, but they would not have the ability, which Callon ascribes to \nthem, to build links and relationships, to mobilise other actors, to associate various human and \nnon-human elements, to reveal contexts in which transactions and exchanges take place. Most of \nthese activities are assisted and supported by contracts and various documents, which rise to the \npoint of an artefact that induces further changes in the network (Callon 1986, 1992). The \nmobilisation process requires not only individual or collective strategies, but requires pro-active \nand purposeful behaviour on behalf of the acting agencies. The proactive behaviour involves a \nprocess of selection of a particular course of action from a range of alternatives, or requires a \ndecision before any action takes place.  \n \nEnrolment and Network Construction \n \nAt the beginning of any enrolment stands a human act of knowledge construction, which brings \nto life the entity of technical and other material objects. New product designs and technology \ninventions and new realisation of outputs are at the foundations of a new network construction. \nEven when the very product and technology design is the aim of the project network, it builds \n 15\nupon previous human inventions and knowledge embodied in texts and documents. These non-\nhuman elements have no capabilities or power in themselves to enrol other entities. They only \nfacilitate the enrolment process by carrying ascriptions from one human actor to another. \n \nThe reconstruction of the economic and social context in which various ascriptions take place is \npossible only as \u2018selective, or subjective interpretation\u2019 of this context. If we would like to \nemploy the electron for example in a new process, we have to reconstruct in our mind, or to \nunderstand the experimental context in which the original properties of the electron have been \nobserved. Only based on our understanding of the electron and its properties, we can ascribe a \nnew role for it. These ascriptions, enrolments and translations take place outside the eye of the \noriginal observer \u2013 the physicists that have discovered and registered the properties of the \nelectron in the first place. It is true that the physicists and the new actors, that are trying to \nconstruct a new actor-network with the electron enrolled in it, are connected. They are connected \nthrough the information they share, and their knowledge of the electron. With the enrolment of \nthe electron, the new actors enrol the physicists as well, and their texts in which the properties of \nthe electron are described. \n \nTo summarise this discussion, our argument is that non-human actors in heterogeneous networks \ndon\u2019t act by themselves, and don\u2019t speak for themselves, as argued by Callon (1986, 1992). They \nare enrolled in the new project along with the incorporation of their previous actor-network \nrelationships. We enrol not only the electron in our network, but also the physicists that invented \nit, and their knowledge of the electron. This newcomplex actor-network enables us to achieve \nour own objectives.  \n \nThe construction of networks also refers to the concept of \u2018framing\u2019, which is raised in the most \nrecent work by Callon (1998). Within the framing process network members behave in a \nstrategic manner, negotiate the frame for their interactions and exchanges, i.e. the rules and the \nroles that each of them has to play. At the same time they employ resources, including their own \ncognitive and relational resources, offering their actor-world for the integration of the network, \nand the negotiation of the frame. The frame of a network is composed of negotiated and agreed \nroles, positions, and relationships between actors, and it includes the network structure, as well \nas the rules that govern transactions and exchanges within the network. \n \nAnother metaphor, used by Callon, is \u2018staging\u2019. This describes how actors interpret the wider \nsurroundings in order not only to position themselves in a network, and to prescribe for \nthemselves performance roles, but also to relate to the wider socio-economic conditions. This \neffort of establishing a relationship between themselves and the wider context is also described \nas strategic behaviour beyond the network boundaries. This active enrolment and translation of \nmultiple elements from the environment serves multiple purposes \u2013 the construction of the \nnetwork itself, the positioning of the actor in it, and the positioning of the network in the wider \ncontext (i.e. promotion practices by businesses). \n \n \n \n \n \n 16\nTexts and Interpretation \n \nOnly human actors can select, interpret texts, ascribe roles, and put exchange value to resources, \nobjects and processes1. By interpreting texts we understand the ability of an actor to attribute \nmeaning to a link \/  relationship with another entity. The texts themselves have no capabilities of \nthat kind. They don\u2019t speak for themselves. Audiences and readers can speak for texts by \nattributing meaning and constructing other \u2018texts\u2019 in order to \u2018express\u2019 and to make explicit their \nown understanding of what they have read and observed.  \n \nCallon quite rightly puts the texts into the category of \u2018pure intermediaries\u2019 (Callon 1992). Texts \nand documents participate in the process of ascription, translation, and enrolment but only as \nintermediaries, i.e. carrying the message of the translator, to the reader, and the audience. Texts \ncould be spokesmen only within the boundaries of the translator\u2019s knowledge. The translator\u2019s \ncapabilities of translation and enrolment are crucial as much as the reader\u2019s capabilities of \n\u2018decoding\u2019 and \u2018deconstruction\u2019 of the meaning of these texts. Beyond the capabilities of the \ntranslator and the reader-observer, the texts themselves are merely complex entities, containing \ncoded information and meaning about other entities and various associations between these other \nentities.  \n \nAn important implication of our reasoning above is the point of the double interpretation \u2013 first, \nthe coding when the text is constructed by the \u2018author\u2019, and second, the decoding, when the text \nis received by the \u2018reader-observer\u2019. Therefore, each text brings two additional agents \u2013 the \nauthor of the text, and the reader-observer. Here, Callon has a very good concept of an actor- \nnetwork in a network. However, the network of the text is composed of the author and the reader. \nThe text itself is merely a carrier of the interests and the knowledge of the two actors. \n  \nThe scientific text can only be a representation of a heterogeneous network of authors, audiences, \nresearch laboratories - using the \u2018text\u2019, firms, government agencies \u2013 certifying the \u2018text\u2019, pieces \nof knowledge and technology, or other objects reflected in this \u2018text\u2019. Yet this heterogeneous \nrepresentation could be subjected to re-interpretation only by a reader-observer. But the \nobservation, or the deconstruction of the text (and the accompanying interpretations of the \nassociations that are encrypt in the \u2018text\u2019) has to be performed by a knowledgeable agent, or by a \nhuman actor.  \n \nThe text or documentation is an encription of existing objects, entities, and relationships. The \nexistence of the electron in Callon\u2019s scientific network is only within the text and the knowledge \nboundaries that describe the properties of the electron as discovered by the physicists. The \nvarious characteristics of the electron are translated into \u2018scientific text\u2019 by the physicists. The \ntext as a holder of the physicists\u2019 knowledge enables other human actors to \u2018employ\u2019 the electron \nin new technologies, products, or processes. Other actors can employ the electron within the \nboundaries of their own knowledge and understanding, based on the texts and the coded \nknowledge from previous actors. The new actors can ascribe new roles to the electron in their \nown actor-network, which goes beyond the original knowledge & text.  \n \n                                                          \n1Interaction in networks involves various forms of exchanges of information, resources, personal commitments and \naffiliations, and each of these has a different exchange value for the 'donor' and for the 'recipient'.  \n 17\n \nNETWORK DYNAMICS \n \nOnce constructed, networks generate their own dynamics of transactions, exchanges, and \nrelationships. The uneven distribution of resources, unequal participation in decision making and \nallocation of resources is associated with concentration of power and produces various forms of \nco-ordination. \n \nPower and Network Co-ordination \n \nMintzberg (1983) refers back to a 1952 paper by Papandreou about the existence of multiple \nobjectives coming from the internal and the external environment, passing through a peak co-\nordinator that reconciles these goals into a single preference function. The concept of a peak co-\nordinator could be liased with the concept of a co-ordinating agency in a network, or actors with \nhigh concentration of non-redundant contacts who occupy positions of high centrality, and are \nlocated close to structural holes (Burt, 1992, Brass, 1992). The difficulty with a network analysis \nis to identify the main co-ordinating agency that sets communication and decision priorities for \nthe entire net. Usually it is assumed that networks imply a mechanism of self-co-ordination and \nself-organisation among de-centralised parts (or agents), in a process of information exchange.  \n \nHowever, network analysis has not found yet significant evidence for self-co-ordination as a \nwidely implied mechanism in the real business world, but rather as an exception. On the \ncontrary, the dynamics of relations between different agents suggest that network structures do \ntransform into hierarchies under certain conditions (i.e. in joint ventures, acquisitions, horizontal \nand vertical integrations), or represent equally competitive environments, such as markets (i.e. in \nthe case of subcontracting, outsourcing, and alternative suppliers). \n \nMintzberg\u2019s discussion in this respect is quite adversarial and suggests that members of an \norganisation (assumed as an intra-organisational network of individuals) are involved in a \ncomplex process of negotiation over organisational objectives. As an introduction to his theory \nof power in organisations, Mintzberg refers to the work by Cyert and March (1963) on coalitions \nto discuss the fact that the establishment of organisation\u2019s goals is far from a rational process. All \noutside and inside participants in the decision making process are continuously bargaining and \nnegotiating with each other the inducements in return for contributions. Therefore the \ndetermination of the outcomes (or the organisational goals) is a result of the dynamics of \n\u2018shifting participants, shifting needs, shifting power within the coalition\u2019 (Mintzberg, 1983: 16).  \n \nBusiness and management networks exist in a broader environment, which usually provides a set \nof rules, and regulations that affect the network performance and operations. Some networks in \ntheir evolution achieve high level of cohesion based on trust and commitment by all members to \nprolong the existing relations. However, we may expect that the majority of networks envisage a \ncertain level of asymmetry which is generated by larger firms, more experienced managers, or \ncharismatic leaders. These network leaders are expected to have a major impact on the structure \nof the entire net, the rules and regulations for performance, and specific distribution of \ninducements, incentives and profits. \n \n 18\nIn a network there is an ongoing process of re-distribution of resources and information which \naims to shift the balance of power and influence. This adversarial tendency between network \nmembers could be outwit in two ways: either by enhancing control and dependency (and creating \nhierarchy of subordination in a network), or by developing trust and commitment to the existing \ncontracts and relations. This analysis suggests that there are two main types of networks - self-\nregulating (through norms, rules, loyalty, commitment and trust) and regulated (either internally \nby powerful members, or externally through hierarchies). It is important to mention that the two \ntypes are ideal and form a scale that may accommodate all practical cases of business networks. \nBoth project networks and supplier networks can be regulated, as well as self-regulating. \n \nTo establish the intra-organisational dynamics, Mintzberg (1983) refers to the work by Petro \nGeorgiou (1973) which looks at the concept of the organisation as an arbitrary defined focus of \ninterests. Georgiou views the internal and the external participants in organisational goal setting \nas a strategic force in an organisation, whose behaviour is determined by the rewards they \npursue. The process of decision making and goal setting is seen as a market exchange of \nincentives. In this view the market is seen as a fundamental process, which is part of the \nfunctioning of organisational hierarchy. \n \nThis translated into the concepts of network analysis means that a relationship in a network \nstructure exists because of the outcomes, or the rewards it brings to the related members. The \nincentives they exchange between themselves serve to maintain the existing relations. However, \na relation is initiated by one member (called by Burt a \u2018network entrepreneur\u2019), who is the first to \nidentify a new opportunity, and in pursue of realisation of that opportunity he\/she establishes a \nnew relationship (see Burt, 1992). This means that usually one member of the network will have \nat least the time advantage in negotiating a formal contract that is to substantiate a relation \nbetween two partners.  \n \nEntrepreneurs who establish links with other agents for exchange of goods and services, \ninformation and ideas, affects, or influence (Tichy, Tushman, and Fombrun, 1979: 508) usually \nbuild networks. It is expected that these entrepreneurs will have high level of centrality in a \nnetwork, and will have initially high level of control over decisions in the network. The \nevolution of the network will depend to a great extent on the vision of these \u2018network designers\u2019 \nand their ability to lead the network processes.  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS: COMPLEMENTARITY OF THE 'RELATIONAL\u2019 AND THE \n\u2018POSITIONAL\u2019 APPROACHES \n \nThe interest in network analysis has significantly grown during the last decade. The lack of \nleading theory is evident looking at the fragmentation of empirical research. The structural \nparadigm remains dominant, even though there are serious attempts to investigate the \nrelationships between business actors. Burt makes a significant step forward with his theory of \naction resourcing from both the \u2018relational\u2019 and the \u2018positional\u2019 approaches in network \nanalysis. However, for his mathematical modelling he acknowledges that the relational approach \nis not suitable, as it requires all respondents and observers to know the network boundaries. He \nacknowledges that the advantages of the relational approach are that network models describe \n 19\nthe intensity of dyadic relationships, and that researchers could describe an actor\u2019s behaviour \nknowing only few of his\/her relations, and without attending his\/her many other relations (Burt, \n1982: 30). Appropriate measures are density and transitivity in networks, as well as  \ndirectionality, reciprocity and multiplexity. The focus on relationships diminishes the role of the \nfact that the actors  are  heterogeneous. \n \nOn the contrary, the positional approach allows research without knowing the network \nboundaries, but requires knowledge of all relationships of an actor (or building Ego-networks for \neach actor), in order to determine his\/her position in relation to all maintained contacts. Burt \nsystematically explores different options within the positional approach, and develops his \narguments about redundancy, structural equivalence, and structural holes. The main measures \nthat he uses within the Ego-network are: range, density, multiplexity, and heterogeneity of \ncontacts. Range is measured by the diversity of actors enrolled by the Ego in its network. Density \nof Ego-network is measured by the average intensity of contacts, maintained by the Ego. \nMultiplexity and heterogeneity are measured by the content of the dyadic relationships, where  \nheterogeneity derives from the properties of each actor and his\/her relationships. While range  \nassumes diversity of actors, the measure of density assumes homogeneity. This approach is \nparticularly enriched by Callon\u2019s work on actor-networks, with the focus on technologies and \nother scientific artefacts as agents in a project network. \n \nIn this context, both human and non-human actors have a duality of existence in a network: they \nexist by themselves with their own properties, and they exist as enrolled, incorporated, \nmobilised, or absorbed by the network, with ascribed roles, functions and characteristics. This \nfact raises the fundamental question of research perspectives. This is the choice between: on the \none hand, conceptualisation of the network members with their properties, and on the other hand, \nconceptualisation of the actor-world through \u2018reading\u2019 the translations and prescriptions of roles \nin various texts, research maps, or business contracts. Both approaches have to address in \naddition the question of the relationship between the strategic behaviour of the core actors, and \nthe roles imposed and ascribed to periphery actors and non-human entities. The network \ndynamics takes place both within the core and the periphery of a network. It is driven both by the \nkey players and by the strategic behaviour of all human actors. \n \nThe dynamic change of suppliers and buyers depends usually on the activity of the central and \nleading members of the network, who control the negotiation process and determine the \n\u2018membership status\u2019 of the peripheral members. As more control is spread amongst different \nmembers of the network, more interconnected are the members overall and more complex \nexchanges take place within the network.  \n \nThe fact that the behaviour of the actors is socially constructed does not invalidate the fact that \nthis behaviour exists independently of the \u2018construction process\u2019, and observers usually are \ncollecting and interpreting evidence about this behaviour \u2013 using a de-construction approach. \n \nThe distribution of resources amongst network members is determined by the centrality of their \nlocation in the network, and particularly in relation to the flows of information, goods and \nservices. Centrality and coalitions in networks are the means used by network agents to acquire \n 20\nand maintain access to resources. In this respect network processes are a result of both \nspontaneous and strategic behaviour. \n \nImportant elements of the actor-network are the outcomes from the activities of the enrolled \nactors. Business networks, particularly, are judged by the results, which sometimes are re-\ninvested into the network. The results could range from skills, experience, profits, or new \ntechnologies. The research questions related to evaluation of network outcomes are long overdue \nto be explored. \n \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n \nBrass, D.
