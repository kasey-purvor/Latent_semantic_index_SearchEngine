The chemotactic response of a cell population to a single chemical species has\nbeen characterized experimentally for many cell types and has been extensively studied from\na theoretical standpoint. However, cells frequently have multiple receptor types and can detect\nand respond chemotactically to more than one chemical. How these signals are integrated\nwithin the cell is not known, and we therefore adopt a macroscopic phenomenological\napproach to this problem. In this paper we derive and analyze chemotactic models based\non partial differential (chemotaxis) equations for cell movement in response to multiple\nchemotactic cues. Our derivation generalizes the approach of Othmer and Stevens [29], who\nhave recently developed a modeling framework for studying different chemotactic responses\nto a single chemical species. The importance of such a generalization is illustrated by the\neffect of multiple chemical cues on the chemotactic sensitivity and the spatial pattern of\ncell densities in several examples. We demonstrate that the model can generate the complex\npatterns observed on the skin of certain animal species and we indicate how the chemotactic\nresponse can be viewed as a form of positional indicator.\n1. Introduction\nA characteristic feature of a wide variety of living organisms is that they can alter\ntheir motile behavior in response to external environmental cues and, in particular,\nto chemical stimuli. Examples range over many orders of magnitude in spatial\nscale. The green turtle, Chelonia mydas travels over 1000 miles to its breeding\nground, through detection of an unknown chemical source originating there [19]\nand species of shark have the ability to detect traces of blood miles from an injured\nanimal. At the other extreme, fibroblast cells are thought to move into wounds in\nresponse to chemical signals emitted at the wound site, and in cellular slime mold\nK.J. Painter\u2217, P.K.

Painter et al.\nDictyostelium discoideum, amoebae respond to the chemoattractant cAMP over\nspatial scales of the order of a cell diameter [28].\nThe directed motile response of organisms to chemical cues is called chemo-\ntaxis. Frequently this individual response is manifested at the population level by\nthe collective movement of a population up (or down) a gradient in concentration\nof a chemoattractant (or chemorepellent). Organisms also rely on other forms of\ntaxis for guidance, including light (phototaxis), electric fields (galvanotaxis), mag-\nnetic fields (magnetotaxis), and adhesive gradients (haptotaxis). Smaller organisms\nsuch as bacteria frequently rely on some form of kinesis, which involves modula-\ntion of either the speed or the duration of movement in response to environmental\nconditions. Both taxes and kineses can often be described by similar macroscopic\nequations, called chemotaxis equations (to be discussed later), even though the\nstochastic processes that describe movement at the single-organism level may be\nquite different. Thus one frequently lumps macroscopic descriptions of both taxes\nand kineses together under the general heading of taxes.\nChemotaxis in bacterial species such as E. coli and S. typhimurium has been\nextensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. E. coli cells move by ro-\ntating rigid helical flagella in a corkscrew-like manner [32]. Each cell contains 6\u20138\nflagella distributed uniformly over the cell surface [37], which, when rotated coun-\nterclockwise, coalesce into a propulsive bundle, resulting in a relatively straight\n\u201crun\u201d [5]. When rotated clockwise they fly apart, resulting in a \u201ctumble\u201d which\nreorients the cell but causes no significant translocation. The cell thus alternates\nbetween runs and reorienting tumbles. In the absence of stimuli, the probability per\nunit time of a tumble is essentially independent of when the last tumble occurred\n[37]. In a chemoeffector gradient, the cell carries out chemotactic migration by\nextending runs that carry it in favorable directions. Using specific chemoreceptors\nto monitor its chemical environment, E. coli perceives spatial gradients as tempo-\nral changes in attractant or repellent concentration. The cell in effect compares its\nenvironment during the past second with the previous 3\u20134 seconds and responds\naccordingly. Attractant increases and repellent decreases transiently raise the prob-\nability of CCW rotation, or \u2018bias\u2019, and then a sensory adaptation process returns\nthe bias to baseline, enabling the cell to detect and respond to further concentra-\ntion changes [36]. Attractants include sugars, amino acids and small peptides, and\nnegative chemotaxis (repulsion) occurs in response to noxious substances.\nThe chemotactic response of cells to a single attractant or repellant has been\ncharacterized experimentally for many cell types and has been extensively stud-\nied from a theoretical standpoint [30,28]. However, many cell types have multiple\nreceptor types and can detect and respond chemotactically to more than one chem-\nical. For example, in wiring the nervous system of a developing embryo, tight\ndirectional control of the growth of axons is needed in order to ensure that they\nconnect properly with nerve cells, muscles and other tissues. The four principal\ncues involved are short range (surface) attractants and repellents and long range\n(diffusive) attractants and repellents. Many diffusible attractants and repellents have\nbeen discovered, principally Netrin-1 [33] and members of the semaphorin families\n[12], [22]. While it functions as an attractant for certain types of axons, Netrin-1\nalso serves as a repellent for other types [7]. It is believed that many chemicals are\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 287\ninvolved in guidance, and that each type of molecule attracts some axons and repels\nothers.\nChemotaxis has also been widely-studied in the clinical sciences because it\nis an important component of certain aspects of the immune response. Chemat-\ntractants released at the site of an infection attract white blood cells in the first\nresponse [1], and it has recently been found that adaptation plays an important role\nin guiding leukocytes through the attractant landscape set up by spatially-separated\nsources [15]. In tumor-induced angiogenesis, cancerous cells secrete chemoattrac-\ntants into the surrounding tissue, stimulating endothelial cells in neighboring blood\nvessels to migrate towards the tumor, thus creating a blood vessel link to the tumor.\nSeveral chemoattractants (or tumor angiogenic factors) have been identified, in-\ncluding basic fibroblast growth factor, angiogenin and vascular endothelial growth\nfactor.\nDespite the evidence showing that cells respond chemotactically to multiple\nenvironmental cues, mathematical models and experimental studies typically focus\non the response to a single stimulus. However, the presence of multiple chemotactic\nsignals raises a number of important questions, viz.,\n\u2022 How are the multiple signals integrated intracellularly and interpreted to initiate\nmovement? For example, how is the occupancy of different receptor types in\na bacterium integrated and transduced into a response? It is known that the\nchemotactic protein CheYp modulates the rotational bias of a flagellar motor,\nand thus signal integration is easy for pathways using the same chemotaxis\nproteins, but how is it done when different receptor types generate different\nsignal types?\n\u2022 What effects do competing attractant and\/or repellent signals have on macro-\nscopic spatial patterns? For example, bacteria form a variety of intricate spatial\npatterns under different nutrient levels [4,38,3,6] but little is known as to to\nwhether these patterns depend significantly on the presence of multiple sig-\nnals, and whether simple changes in the balance between different signals can\naccount for observed changes in the pattern types.\n\u2022 How is information filtered and processed by the organism? If signals of differ-\nent magnitudes (e.g. in gradient strength or concentration level), or of different\nspatial and temporal scales are detected, how can an organism process the in-\nformation so as to to generate the optimal response? This question may be\nparticularly relevant in ecology, where multiple signaling cues can vary on\ndifferent spatial scales.\nThese questions have not been answered at the molecular or higher level in any\nsystem, and therefore we adopt a more phenomenological approach here. We begin\nwith a master equation for a stochastic space jump process and reduce this to a\npartial differential equation to describe the movement of organisms in response to\nmultiple tactic signals. We derive a number of forms for the chemotactic sensitivity\n(defined later), based on how information external to the organism is detected and\ntransduced to result in movement, and we investigate in detail spatial patterning\nin a simple model for a cell population responding to two competing attractants.\n288 K.J. Painter et al.\nApplications of the work are considered in bacterial cell movement and the com-\nplicated pigmentation patterns seen on the skins of certain animals.\nHow these signals are integrated within the cell is not known, and we therefore\nadopt a macroscopic phenomenological approach to this problem. In this paper we\nderive and analyze chemotactic models based on partial differential (chemotaxis)\nequations for cell movement in response to multiple chemotactic cues.\n2. Modeling the tactic response to multiple signals\nOthmer and Stevens [29] investigated continuum limits of a continuous time, dis-\ncrete space random walk described by a master equation, in which walkers execute\ninstantaneous jumps in space at random times. In their analysis, which was moti-\nvated by results of Davis [8] on reinforced random walks, the transition probabilities\ndepend on a control substance that itself evolves in time and space. In the following\nwe begin with the same master equation, but now under the assumption that the\ntransition rate is dependent on multiple signals.\nSuppose that the probability that a walker is at n \u2208 Z at time t , given that the\nwalk begin at 0 at t = 0, is given by pn(t). By hypothesis this satisfies the evolution\nequation\n\u2202pn\n\u2202t\n= T+n\u22121(U)pn\u22121 +T\u2212n+1(U)pn+1 \u2212 (T+n (U)+T\u2212n (U))pn. (1)\nHereT\u00b1n are the conditional probabilities per unit time of a 1\u2013step jump to n\u00b11,\nand (T+n (U)+T\u2212n (U))\u22121 is the mean waiting time at the nth site. U represents\nthe density of the control species, and is given by\nU =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n...\n... \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ...\nu1,n\u22121\/2 u2,n\u22121\/2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 uk,n\u22121\/2\nu1,n u2,n \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 uk,n\nu1,n+1\/2 u2,n+1\/2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 uk,n+1\/2\n...\n... \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ...\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\n, (2)\nfor k control species. We have defined the control species on a lattice of half step size,\ni.e. uj,n\u22121\/2 is the density of species uj at position n\u22121\/2. The three different types\nof models we consider here are characterized by the dependence of the transition\nrates on U . Following the classification of [29], we define these as strictly local,\nbarrier and gradient models.\n2.1. Strictly Local Models\nIn this model the probability of a jump depends only on the level of control species\nat the site of the walker. We denote by un the densities of control species u1, . . . , uk\nat site n. We assume that the domain\u000e is homogeneous and isotropic, and therefore\nthe transition probabilities do not depend directly on the lattice site, but only on\nlocal densities un. It follows thatT\u2212 =T+(\u2261T), and consequently (1) becomes\n\u2202pn\n\u2202t\n=T(un\u22121)pn\u22121 +T(un+1)pn+1 \u2212 2T(un)pn. (3)\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 289\nWe define x = nh, extend the function p to R, and expand the right hand side\nto second order in h as a function of x. We introduce a scaling of the transi-\ntion rates,T(u) = \u03bbT(u), with the property that the limit limh\u2192 0,\u03bb\u2192\u221e \u03bbh2 =\npositive constant (\u2261 D) exists, then in this diffusion limit,\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= D \u2202\n2\n\u2202x2\n(T(u)p), (4)\nThe existence of this limit depends on the existence of a priori bounds on higher-\norder derivatives. In higher space dimensions the second derivative is replaced by\nthe Laplacian. Equation (4) is subject to initial conditions and, when a finite domain\nis considered, boundary conditions. Furthermore p should always be nonnegative.\nIn one dimension the particle flux is\nJ = \u2212D\u2202(T(u)p)\n\u2202x\n= \u2212D(T(u))\u2202p\n\u2202x\n\u2212Dp\u2202(T(u))\n\u2202x\n. (5)\nWe define the chemotactic sensitivity to species i, \u03c7i , by\n\u03c7i = \u2212DTui (6)\nand then can write the flux as\nJ = \u2212D(Ti (u))\u2202p\n\u2202x\n+ p\nk\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c7i(u)\n\u2202ui\n\u2202x\n. (7)\nIf \u03c7i > 0 (i.e.,Tui < 0), species i is an attractant and cells move up the gradient\nof i at a speed that may depend on other species via the dependence of \u03c7i on u.\nHowever the global movement is determined by the sum of the responses to the\nindividual gradients.\n2.2. Barrier models\nIn the barrier model the transition rates for a cell at site n depend on u at n\u00b1 1\/2.\nOne finds that without further conditions on the transition rates there is no directed\nmovement in response to the signal; the chemotactic sensitivity vanishes identically\n[29]. However, if the transition rates are renormalized so that the mean waiting\ntime is constant across the domain, then aggregation may occur. Thus we define\nthe renormalized transition ratesN\u00b1 as\nN+n (U)+N\u2212n (U) = constant, (8)\nand without loss of generality we take the constant as 1. The above equation is\nsatisfied by choosing the following forms for our transition rates,\nN\u00b1n (U) =N\u00b1(un\u22121\/2,un+1\/2) =\nT(un\u00b11\/2)\nT(un+1\/2)+T(un\u22121\/2) , (9)\n290 K.J. Painter et al.\nwhere N\u00b1 : Rk \u00d7 Rk \u2192 R. We again assume that the lattice is homogeneous,\nwe rescale the renormalized transition rates as N = \u03bbN, and we assume that\nD \u2261 limn\u2192\u221e,h\u21920 \u03bbh22 exists. Then in the diffusion limit we obtain\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= D \u2202\n\u2202x\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\u2202p\n\u2202x\n\u2212 2p\nk\u2211\nj=1\n(\nN1,j \u2212N2,j\n) \u2202uj\n\u2202x\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 . (10)\nHereN1,j represents the derivative with respect to the j th component of the first\nargument and N2,j represents the derivative with respect to the j th component\nof the second argument, both evaluated at (un,un). These are determined from\nEquation (9), and Equation (10) becomes\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= D\u2202\n2p\n\u2202x2\n\u2212D \u2202\n\u2202x\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edp k\u2211\nj=1\n(lnT)uj \u00b7\n\u2202uj\n\u2202x\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 . (11)\nThus the chemotactic sensitivity with respect to species i for the renormalized\nbarrier model is given by\n\u03c7i = D(lnT)ui . (12)\n2.3. Non-local or gradient models\nThe non-local model is based on assumption that the transition rates depend on\ndifferences between lattice sites of the density of the control species. In the sim-\nplest case one supposes only nearest neighbor differences, and then can define\nT\u2213n\u00b11 : U \u2192 R by\nT+n\u22121 = \u03b1 + \u03b2(\u03c4(un)\u2212 \u03c4(un\u22121)), (13)\nT\u2212n+1 = \u03b1 + \u03b2(\u03c4(un)\u2212 \u03c4(un+1)), (14)\nand \u03c4 : Rk \u2192 R with \u03b1(\u2265 0) and \u03b2 constants. This gives the master equation\n\u2202pn\n\u2202t\n= \u03b1(pn+1 \u2212 2pn + pn\u22121)\u2212 \u03b2(\u03c4(un+1)\u2212 \u03c4(un))(pn+1 + pn)\n\u2212\u03b2(\u03c4(un)\u2212 \u03c4(un\u22121))(pn + pn\u22121). (15)\nWe assume a scaling in the transition rates such that D = limh\u21920,\u03bb\u2192\u221e \u03bbh2, and\nwe obtain in the diffusion limit\n\u2202p\n\u2202t\n= D\u03b1\u2202\n2p\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 2D\u03b2 \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\np\nk\u2211\ni=1\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u2202uk\n\u00b7 \u2202uk\n\u2202x\n)\n. (16)\nThus the individual tactic sensitivities are given by\n\u03c7i = 2D\u03b2\u03c4ui (17)\nand the taxis is with respect to species i is positive if \u03c4ui > 0.\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 291\n3. The chemotactic sensitivities for multiple signals\nIt is clear from the preceding derivations that the dependence of the chemotactic\nsensitivities on the control species arises from the dependence of the transition rates\non U . In this section we derive various chemotactic sensitivity functions and show\nin particular that the presence of multiple signals carries with it the possibility of\ncompetition and nonlinear interactions in any of the detection, transduction and\nresponse steps.\n3.1. Linear\nThe simple example of linear dependence of the transition rate on u, given by\nT = T0 + b \u00b7 u where T0 and b are such thatT > 0, illustrates key differences\nin behavior between the three models. It follows from (6), (12) and (17) that the\nchemotactic sensitivities for the three models are\n\u03c7j = \u2212Dbj , \u03c7j = D bj\nT0 + b \u00b7 u , \u03c7j = 2D\u03b2bj . (18)\nIn the barrier model the chemotactic sensitivity is monotone decreasing in the\ntotal chemical concentration if all bis are positive, whereas the other models have\nconstant sensitivity with respect to all species. The sign of the sensitivities imply that\nthe local model results in aggregation at low concentrations of species j if bj > 0,\nwhereas barrier and gradient models lead to aggregation at high concentrations\nunder the same condition [29].\n3.2. Receptor-based response laws\nThe linear law used above is based on the assumption that the transition rate contains\na basal rate a and a component proportional to the concentration. However signals\nare often detected via receptors or other detectors on the surface, and since their\nnumber is limited, the transition rate cannot increase indefinitely. Moreover, at the\ncellular level receptors frequently span the membrane and are inactive when free\nof ligand, but active when bound. In the absence of a detailed transduction scheme\nwe assume that when there is a single control species the response is proportional\nto the fraction of receptors that is occupied by the control species [29]. Thus if the\nbinding reaction is written\nRi + u\nk+\n\u21c0\u21bd\nk\u2212\nRa, (19)\nthen the fraction of activated receptors is given by Ra = R0u\/(K + u), where\nK = k\u2212\/k+ and R0 = Ra + Ri is the total number of cell surface receptors. If\nthe transition rate comprises a basal rate and a component proportional to the total\nnumber of occupied receptors, then for the local and renormalized barrier models\nwe have that\nT = T0 + T1 R0u\nK + u (20)\n292 K.J. Painter et al.\nand this leads to chemotactic sensitivities of the form\n\u03c7 = \u2212D T1R0K\n(K + u)2\nfor strictly local sensing, and\n\u03c7 = D T1KR0\n(K + u)[T0(K + u)+ T1R0u]\nfor the renormalized barrier model.\nSimilarly, if we assume that \u03c4 = R0u\/(K+u) for the gradient model we obtain\nthe sensitivity\n\u03c7 = \u03c70\n(K + u)2 (21)\nwhere \u03c70 = 2DR0K\u03b2.\nIt should be noted that now the sensitivity is monotone decreasing in all cases,\nand does so quadratically at large u, which reflects the fact that the detection ma-\nchinery saturates at large signal strengths.\n3.2.1. Different receptor types\nWhen there are two distinct signals present there are two different types of sensi-\ntivities, depending on whether the signals bind competitively to the same receptor\nor whether there is a different receptor for each signal. Experimental evidence sug-\ngests that both cases occur depending on the specificity of the receptors. Some\nreceptors detect only one signal, whereas in other cases the cell surface contains\nseveral types of chemotactic receptors, each receptive to a small group of signaling\nchemicals (see [31] and [20]).\nIn the latter case, two types of chemoattractant molecules, u and v, bind to two\ndifferent receptor types, Ru and Rv . This is a straightforward extension of the one\nspecies case, and we derive the following expressions for the number of activated\nreceptors, Rau and Rav :\nRau =\nR0uu\nKu + u, Rav =\nR0v v\nKv + v . (22)\nR0u and R0v are the total number of receptors of type Ru and Rv , respectively.\nKu = k\u22121 \/k+1 and Kv = k\u22122 \/k+2 , where k\u22121 , k+1 , k\u22122 and k+2 are the rate constants\ndue to rate equations similar to that given by (19). It is straightforward to extend\nthe above to n chemical species, and we obtain the following expression for the\ntotal number of activated receptors:\n\u2211\nRauj =\nn\u2211\nj=1\nR0uj uj\nKj + uj , (23)\nwhere Rauj is the number of activated receptors of type Ruj , R0uj is the total\nnumber of receptors of type Ruj and Kj = k\u2212j \/k+j . Using the above expression for\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 293\nthe transition rate for the gradient model we find that the individual chemotactic\nsensitivities are given by\n\u03c7i =\n2D\u03b2R0ui Ki\n(Ki + ui)2 . (24)\nIt is clear from this that these sensitivities have the same form as the sensitivity in\nthe presence of a single chemical signal, which is a result of the fact that there is\nno interaction of the signals at the detection stage.\n3.2.2. Same receptor type\nHowever, if the signals bind competitively then we expect to see this interaction\nof the signals reflected in the chemotactic sensitivities. Now we suppose that an\ninactive receptor Ri is activated by binding to either of two molecules, u or v. Thus\nthe binding reactions are\nRi + u\nk+1\n\u21c0\u21bd\nk\u22121\nRau, Ri + v\nk+2\n\u21c0\u21bd\nk\u22122\nRav . (25)\nand we assume that the total number of receptorsR0 = Rau+Rav +Ri is constant.\nAssuming binding of either of the molecules occurs on the same time scale and is\nfaster than the subsequent transduction and movement response, we have[\nR0 \u2212 (Rau + Rav )\n]\nuk+1 = k\u22121 Rau, (26)[\nR0 \u2212 (Rau + Rav )\n]\nvk+2 = k\u22122 Rav . (27)\nIf the transition rate is proportional to the number of activated receptors,Rau+Rav ,\nwe find from (26) and (27) that\nRau + Rav =\nR0(k\n+\n1 k\n\u2212\n2 u+ k+2 k\u22121 v)\nk\u22121 k\n\u2212\n2 + (k+1 k\u22122 u+ k+2 k\u22121 v)\n. (28)\nMore generally, for the case of n species, u1, . . . , un, we define Raui to be the\nnumber of receptors activated by chemical species ui andR0 to be the total number\nof receptors. Following the above procedure we derive\nn\u2211\ni=1\nRaui =\nR0\n[\u2211n\ni=1 uiKp\/Ki\n]\nKp +\n[\u2211n\ni=1 uiKp\/Ki\n] , (29)\nwhere Kj = k\u2212j \/k+j and Kp =\n\u220fn\nj=1 Kj .\nWith the above expression for the transition rate, we find that for a gradient\nmodel the chemotactic sensitivity for the j th species is given by\n\u03c7j = 2D\u03b2KpKj(\nKp +\n[\u2211n\ni=1 uiKp\/Ki\n])2 . (30)\n294 K.J. Painter et al.\nThe only variation in the sensitivity for each individual species results from the\ndifferent values of Kj .\nIt follows that the total chemotactic flux is given by\n2D\u03b2p(\nKp +\n[\u2211n\ni=1 uiKp\/Ki\n])2 \u2211\nj\nKpKj\u2207uj , (31)\nand the direction of the flux is determined by a linear function of the individual\nchemical gradients.\n3.2.3. Nonlinear interaction sensitivity laws\nThus far the transition rates are simply assumed to be a linear combination of the\ntotal number of activated receptors, which means that are a number of independent\nsignaling pathways whose outputs are additive. However, there may also be parallel\npathways, both of which must be activated to induce movement. Thus we assume a\ndependence based on the product of the activated fraction of receptors, which gives\nT = R0,uu\n(Ku + u)\nR0,vv\n(Kv + v) . (32)\nThe chemotactic sensitivities for the gradient model are therefore given by\n\u03c7u = \u03c70,uv\n(Ku + u)2(Kv + v) , \u03c7v =\n\u03c70,vu\n(Kv + v)2(Ku + u) . (33)\nwhere \u03c70,u \u2261 2D\u03b2KuR0,uR0,v and \u03c70,v \u2261 2D\u03b2KvR0,vR0,u. Notice that the above\nimplies that for low v the chemotactic sensitivity response to species u is much\nweaker than the response at high concentrations of v. Thus, by reducing the level\nof v the chemotactic response of the cell may be drastically reduced despite the\npresence of gradients of u. This introduces another level of control, if for example,\nthe production of the signaling chemicals depends on the cell density.\n4. Spatial response to multiple cues\nThe patterns of the spatial distribution of a cell population responding to multiple\ncues is illustrated in the following theoretical model. We consider a Turing system\n[39] as a mechanism for providing spatially heterogeneous chemical distributions to\nwhich a cell population chemotactically responds. More formally, a cell population\ndensity, n(x, t), is defined on the spatial domain \u000e \u2208 Rn. Chemicals u and v,\nwhich are called morphogens, evolve according to a system of reaction-diffusion\nequations. The cell population responds chemotactically to both chemical species,\nleading to the equations\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n= \u2207 \u00b7 {Dn\u2207n\u2212 n\u03c71(u, v)\u2207u\u2212 n\u03c72(u, v)\u2207v}, (34)\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u2207(Du \u00b7 \u2207u)+ f (u, v), (35)\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= \u2207(Dv \u00b7 \u2207v)+ g(u, v), (36)\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 295\nwhere \u03c71 and \u03c72 are the chemotactic sensitivity functions and f and g define\nthe chemical kinetics. Herein cell and chemical diffusion coefficients, Dn,Du and\nDv , are taken as constant. In this first model we assume that the evolution of the\nmorphogens is independent of the cell density. We will refer to the above equations\nas the hybrid model.\nWe first consider a uniformly distributed cell population and, without loss of\ngenerality, set n(x, 0) = 1. Initial conditions for the chemical concentrations are\ntaken as small random perturbations about the homogeneous steady state. Boundary\nconditions are taken to be zero flux. The application of the boundary conditions with\nthe zero population kinetics imposes a conservation law on total cell population,\nviz. \u222b\n\u000e\nn(x, t)dx =\n\u222b\n\u000e\nn(x, 0)dx. (37)\nWe assume that the equations (34)\u2013(36) have a single positive homogeneous steady\nstate (n0, u0, v0), where without loss of generality we taken0 = 1. It is also assumed\nthat the structure of f and g is such that (35) and (36) have a stable nonconstant\nsteady state solution (a Turing pattern) for suitable choices of the kinetic parameters,\nand that the uniform steady state is unstable to small perturbations.\n4.1. Patterning in one dimension\nWe first consider the one-dimensional domain, \u000e = [0, L], and suppose that the\nkinetics are described by a simplified model for the glycolysis reaction [27,9]. The\nmodel (34)\u2013(36) is then given by\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n= \u2202\n\u2202x\n[\nDn\n\u2202n\n\u2202x\n\u2212 n\u03c71(u)\u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u2212 n\u03c7v(v) \u2202v\n\u2202x\n]\n, (38)\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= Du \u2202\n2u\n\u2202x2\n+ \u03b4 \u2212 \u03bau\u2212 uv2, (39)\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= Dv \u2202\n2v\n\u2202x2\n+ \u03bau+ uv2 \u2212 v, (40)\nwith zero-flux boundary conditions:\nDn\n\u2202n\n\u2202x\n\u2212 n\u03c71(u)\u2202u\n\u2202x\n\u2212 n\u03c7v(v) \u2202v\n\u2202x\n= 0 (41)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n= \u2202v\n\u2202x\n= 0 (42)\nat x = 0 and x = L. Thus all three components satisfy a homogeneous Neumann\nboundary condition.\nThe absence of cellular feedback results in a decoupling of the cell move-\nment equation from the reaction-diffusion system. Thus, temporarily we ignore\nthe cell equation (38) and focus on evolution of pattern in the reaction-diffusion\nmodel. A linear analysis of Equations (39)\u2013(40) about the homogeneous steady\nstate, (u0, v0) =\n(\n\u03b4\/(\u03ba + \u03b42), \u03b4), gives a prediction for initial pattern evolution\n296 K.J. Painter et al.\nand the parameter region wherein Turing instabilities can develop. It does not pro-\nvide a specific analytical prediction of the pattern at the heterogeneous steady state\nbecause, as the solution grows, nonlinear terms become dominant and the linear\nanalysis is no longer valid. An analytical approximation for the time independent\nsolutions to Equations (39)\u2013(40) can be obtained, and the results are summarized\nin the Appendix. The general approach can be found in a number of texts [13,16].\nTo first order in the deviation from the uniform steady state, the spatial distribution\nof the morphogens is given by\nu(x) = u0 + u1 cos jx, (43)\nv(x) = v0 + v1 cos jx, (44)\nwhere u1 and v1 can be determined explicitly for a particular set of parameters\nthrough the asymptotic expansion. In Figure 1 (a) we compare analytical and nu-\nmerical approximations for the concentrations of u and v, using the parameters of\nthe figure caption. The validity of solutions derived from a bifurcation analysis,\ngiven by Equations (43)\u2013(44), is demonstrated by the very close correspondence\nwith the numerically derived concentrations.\nWhen the chemotactic sensitivities are non-zero it is possible that patterning\nof the cell population via the response to the nonuniform distribution of the mor-\nphogens, given (43)\u2013(44). The steady state cell distribution that satisfies the bound-\nary conditions is given by\nn(x) = K exp\n(\u222b x\n0\n1\nDn\n(\n\u03c71\ndu\ndx\n+ \u03c72 dv\ndx\n)\ndx\n)\n, (45)\nwhere the constant K can be evaluated using the conservation equation (37), once\nthe u and v distributions are known.\nOne of the primary characteristics of a spatial pattern of the cell population\n(or chemical species) is the number of maxima and minima. For chemical patterns\nthat arise via a Turing instability (with zero flux boundary conditions and close\nto the bifurcation point), this is relatively straightforward: the pattern possesses\na common wavelength with equally spaced peaks. Moreover, the spatial location\nof turning points is the same for both chemical species \u2013 they are either in phase\n(for pure activator-inhibitor kinetics) or in antiphase (for cross activator-inhibitor\nkinetics) [9]. The glycolysis reaction is an example of a cross activator-inhibitor\nreaction system: peaks of u occur at troughs of v and vice versa.\n4.1.1. Patterning in response to a single cue\nThe effect of taxis on cell patterning can be evaluated by a comparison between\nthe critical points of the cell density and the critical points in the chemical concen-\ntrations. The response to one chemical is considered by taking \u03c72 = 0 in Equation\n(45) and assuming that \u03c71 is a function of u only. We determine\ndn\ndx\n= K\nDn\nexp\n(\n1\nDn\n\u222b\n\u03c71(u)\ndu\ndx\ndx\n)\n\u03c71\ndu\ndx\n. (46)\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 297\nThus, providing\u03c71 is non-zero and continuous for allu(x) > 0, the turning points in\nthe cell density coincide with the turning points in the chemical distribution, since\nK exp\n(\n1\nDn\n\u222b\n\u03c71(u)\ndu\ndx\ndx\n)\nis positive. All standard response laws, i.e. constant,\nlogistic and receptor, satisfy these conditions, although one can construct a biphasic\nform that does not to fall into this category.\nWe suppose that the chemical u binds to two different cell surface receptors R\nand S. The fraction of occupied receptors of each type will be given byR0u\/(k1+u)\nand S0u\/(k2 + u) respectively. We further assume that activation of R receptors\ninduces an attractive response, while activation of S receptors induces a repulsive\nresponse. Then if the transition rate is a linear combination of the activated receptors\nwe have that\nT(u) = T0 + T1R0u\nk1 + u \u2212\nT2S0u\nk2 + u. (47)\nWe set \u03b1 = T1R0 and choose k1 = 1 and T2S0 = 1 for convenience. One finds that\nthe chemotactic sensitivity (using a gradient-based transition rule) is\n\u03c71(u) =\n\u03b1k22 \u2212 1+ 2u(\u03b1k2 \u2212 1)+ u2(\u03b1 \u2212 1)\n(1+ u)2(k2 + u)2. (48)\nIf we set \u03b1 < 1 and \u03b1k2 > 1, then in addition to turning points that coincide with\nthose of the chemical concentration, there additional critical points correspond-\ning to locations at which \u03c71 changes sign. This biphasic law models chemotactic\nattraction at lower chemical concentrations, and chemotactic repulsion at higher\nconcentrations. Consequently, cells aggregate at an intermediate level of concen-\ntration. In response to the guidance cue BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor),\nnerve growth cones have been shown to display both chemoattraction and chemore-\npulsion, depending on the level of cAMP [35].\n4.1.2. Cell patterning in response to both chemicals\nIf we specify that the chemotactic sensitivities are constants \u03c71 = \u03b1 and \u03c72 = \u03b2,\nthen the solution for cell density at a heterogeneous steady state can be obtained\nanalytically, and one finds that\nn(x) = Kc exp\n(\n\u03b1u+ \u03b2v\nDn\n)\n, (49)\nwhereKc is a constant. Thus the spatial distribution of the cell density is determined\nby the linear combination \u03b1u+\u03b2v of the morphogens. In Figure 1 (b) \u2013 (d) we plot\nthe function \u03b1u+ \u03b2v for constant \u03b2 and increasing \u03b1, using the analytically- and\nnumerically-computed u and v shown in Figure 1(a). If \u03b1 is sufficiently different\nfrom\u2212\u03b2v1\/u1, there is little difference between the numerically- and analytically-\nderived values of \u03b1u+ \u03b2v, as seen in Figure 1(b). However, as \u03b1 is increased the\nstructure of the analytically- and numerically-computed profiles diverges, as in (c),\nand for a small range of \u03b1 near \u2212\u03b2v1\/u1 the numerical solution displays greater\n298 K.J. Painter et al.\nstructure, with two peaks in the density (cf. (d)). Although the patterns show very\ndifferent structure, the maximum difference between the two profiles for all \u03b1, \u03b2\nis always of the order *2, where a definition for * can be found in the appendix.\nThis arises from the fact that the difference between the numerical and anlytical\napproximations of the chemical concentrations is of order *2. As \u03b1 is increased\nabove \u2212\u03b2v1\/u1 the two profiles again display the same structure.\nThese results suggest that the analytical approximation for n(x) is only valid\noutside a neighborhood of the line \u03b1 = \u2212\u03b2v1\/u1. This restriction can be under-\nstood by examining the second order terms in the asymptotic expansion for the\nchemical concentration done in the Appendix. The second order approximations\nFig. 1. (a) Comparison between analytical and numerically derived chemical concentrations.\nu numerical (solid) and analytical (dashed), v numerical (dot-dash) and analytical (dotted).\nThe discrepancy is very small, reflected by these lines overlying one another. (b) \u2013 (d)\nComparison between \u03b1u + \u03b2v using the analytical and numerical solutions for u and v\nplotted in (a). This function reflects the form of the cell density at steady state under constant\nsensitivity rules.

For the majority of \u03b1\/Dn \u2212 \u03b2\/Dn space the two predictions match. For\nexample, in (b) the solutions lie on each other and are difficult to discern. As\u03b1\/Dn is increased\ntowards\u2212v1\u03b2\/Dnu1, the two forms diverge, (see (c)) until they have different structure, (see\n(d)). Simulations use \u03b4 = 1.2,\u03ba = 0.06,L = \u03c0 ,Du = 1.0 andDv = 0.09809. The analytical\nforms, as determined by the Appendix, use u0 = 0.8, v0 = 1.2, u1 = 0.0545, v1 = \u22120.1561\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 299\nof the chemical concentrations are given by functions of the form\nu(x) = u0 + u1* cos jx + *2 (u20 + u21 cos jx + u22 cos 2jx) (50)\nv(x) = v0 + v1* cos jx + *2 (v20 + v21 cos jx + v22 cos 2jx) . (51)\nFrom the expansion in the Appendix, we only know the magnitudes of u0, u1, u20,\nu22, v0, v1, v20 and v22. The bifurcation analysis does not determine the magnitudes\nof u21 and v21, but does determine the ratio, which is given by u21\/v21 = u1\/v1.\nFor the above forms, the critical points in cell density are the solutions to the\nequation\n*j (\u03b1u1 + \u03b2v1 + *(\u03b1u21 + \u03b2v21)) sin jx + 2j*2(\u03b1u22 + \u03b2v22) sin 2jx = 0,\n(52)\nwhich, in turn, has solutions\nsin jx = 0, (53)\n4*(\u03b1u22 + \u03b2v22) cos jx = \u2212(\u03b1u1 + \u03b2v1 + *(\u03b1u21 + \u03b2v21)). (54)\nThe former defines the same primary turning points as for the first order approx-\nimations, which correspond with those of the chemical concentrations. The latter\nonly has solutions if \u03b1u1 + \u03b2v1 = O(*), and therefore we choose chemotactic\ncoefficients such that \u03b1u1 + \u03b2v1 = 0. From the analysis in the appendix we have\n\u03b1u21 + \u03b2v21 = 0, and thus if \u03b1u22 + \u03b2v22 \u0012= 0, Equation (54) predicts additional\ncritical points that are out of phase with the primary critical points. For the param-\neters considered here, this assumption above is valid. If we fix \u03b2 > 0 and increase\n\u03b1 from below the line \u2212v1\u03b2\/u1, the cell density profiles change nature from a\nform equivalent to the chemical profiles to one with a greater number of turning\npoints, and the latter arise as the result of the superposition of cos jx and cos 2jx\nwaves. Hereafter we label such cell patterns as complex to distinguish them from\nthe simple patterns in which the critical points coincide with those of the chemical\nconcentration.\nThe validity of the above analysis is strengthened by a comparison of analytical\nand numerical solutions for the special case, \u03b1 = \u2212v1\u03b2\/u1. We use this solution\nto obtain an analytical determination of the amplitude of the cell density for the\ncos 2jx wave type pattern, as all cos jx terms drop out (at least up to second order),\nn(x) = K exp\n((\n\u03b1u0 + \u03b2v0 + *2\u03b1u20\n)+ *2 (\u03b1u22 + \u03b2v22) cos 2jx\nDn\n)\n. (55)\nWhen this is evaluated for the parameters of Figure 1 with \u03b1\/Dn = 5.5 and\n\u03b2\/Dn = 1.92, we obtain an amplitude of 0.00046, which compares favorably\nwith the amplitude of the pattern derived via numerical simulation, 0.00048. The\ndiscrepancy is O(*3), where a definition for * can be found in the Appendix. Thus\ncells may exhibit density patterns of greater spatial complexity than that of the un-\nderlying chemical concentration profiles in response to multiple chemotactic cues.\n300 K.J. Painter et al.\nNext we compare these results with those obtained using sensitivities of the\nform\n\u03c71 = \u03b1\n(k1 + u)2 , \u03c72 =\n\u03b2\n(k2 + v)2 , (56)\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2, k1 and k2 are constants and k1, k2 > 0. In this case, the form of the cell\ndensity at the heterogeneous steady state can be found as\nn(x) = Kr exp\n(\n\u2212 1\nDn\n(\n\u03b1\nk1 + u(x) +\n\u03b2\nk2 + v(x)\n))\n. (57)\nwhere Kr is a constant. A calculation of the locations of non-trivial turning points\ngives the following solutions,\n\u03b1u1(v0 + k2 + v1y)2 + \u03b2v1(u0 + k1 + u1y)2 = 0, (58)\nwhere y = cos jx. Rearranging this expression gives the following solutions for y,\ny\u2213 =\n\u00b1(v0 + k2)\n\u221a\u2212\u03b1u1\n\u03b2v1\n\u2212 u0 + k1\nu1 \u2213 v1\n\u221a\u2212\u03b1u1\n\u03b2v1\n. (59)\nOf course the only real solutions lie in the range [\u22121, 1], and it is easy to verify that\neither there is no solution or one solution that satisfies this criterion, depending on\nthe parameters. When one solution does lie in this range we predict that complex\npatterns develop. These predictions are confirmed by a comparison of numerical\nand analytical results. Examples of complex patterns are shown in Figure 2. While\nsimilar to those observed for constant laws, these patterns have greater amplitude\nand occur for a larger range of parameters.\nFig. 2. Patterns predicted by the model with receptor response laws given by (56). We use\nthe analytical predictions determined in the Appendix for the parameters given in Figure 1\n(u0 = 0.8, v0 = 1.2, u1 = 0.0545, v1 = \u22120.1562). Figures (a) through (c) demonstrate\nincreasing complexity as we move through \u03b1-\u03b2 space. Notice that the amplitude of the\ncomplex patterns is larger than corresponding patterns (Figure 1) that arise for constant\nsensitivity laws\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 301\n4.2. Patterning in two dimensions\nIn two dimensions, we assume chemical concentrations of the form,\nu(x, y) = u0 + u1 cos\n(\nn\u03c0x\nLx\n)\ncos\n(\nm\u03c0y\nLy\n)\n, (60)\nv(x, y) = v0 + v1 cos\n(\nn\u03c0x\nLx\n)\ncos\n(\nm\u03c0y\nLy\n)\n. (61)\nFor the above forms two elementary pattern types exist: If n and m are non-zero,\nwe have a checkerboard type pattern composed of peaks and troughs, namely spots,\nwhereas if only one of n or m is non-zero then the pattern consists of stripes.\nUsing the receptor law sensitivities, it is straightforward to analytically demon-\nstrate that the one-dimensional results carry over to two dimensions. The types\nof complex patterns formed in the cell density can be classified as (1) rings, (2)\ninterspersing large and small spots and (3), interspersed broad and narrow stripes.\nFigure 3 illustrates these pattern types.\nWe now consider more complicated chemotactic sensitivity laws. Extending the\nderivation of the biphasic sensitivity law earlier to two chemical species, we assume\na transitional response,\nT(u) = T0 + T1R1u\nk1 + u \u2212\nT2R2u\nk2 + u +\nT3R3v\nk3 + v \u2212\nT4R4u\nk4 + u. (62)\nFor this transitional response, the chemotactic sensitivities terms \u03c71 and \u03c72 take\nthe form given by Equation 48. Analytical results under these laws give rise to\nmore complicated patterns than for the \u201cstandard\u201d laws considered earlier. In two\ndimensions, we observe patterns such as the spots inside rings or variant stripes, as\nshown in Figure 4.\nFig. 3. Typical examples of the complex patterns observed in two dimensions. (a) Rings (b)\nInterspersed large and small spots and (c) Alternating broad and narrow stripes. Patterns\nobtained using receptor type laws for underlying chemical patterns such that u0 = 0.8,\nv0 = 1.2, u1 = 0.2 and v1 = \u22120.6. We take \u03b2\/Dn = 1.0, k1 = 0.8, k2 = 1.0 and \u03b1\/Dn =\n(a) 2.5, (b) 1.8, (c) 1.8. A threshold has been chosen for clarity of presentation\n302 K.J. Painter et al.\nFig. 4. Typical examples of patterns obtained under more complicated sensativity responses.\n(a) Spots inside rings and (b) Series of stripes. In both simulations, we use the parameters\nT1R1 = 1.0, T2R2 = 3.85, T3R3 = 1.0, T4R4 = 3.85, k1 = 0.5, k2 = 2.0, k3 = 0.5, k4 =\n1.95, u0 = v0 = 1.0, u1 = +0.5, v1 = \u22120.3. Once again we have chosen a threshold in the\ncell density to demonstrate the pattern more clearly. For (a) we use an underlying spotted\nchemical pattern, whereas (b) uses an underlying striped pattern\n4.3. Robustness of patterns\nAs we have shown, when the chemotactic sensitvity depends on two chemicals each\nof the different types of sensitivity laws examined leads to increased complexity\nof the spatial distribution of the cells. For constant chemotactic sensitivities this\ncomplexity is dependent on the fine structure of the chemical distributions (which\nanalytically corresponds to the higher order terms of the asymptotic expansions),\nwhereas with receptor laws it arises through nonlinear terms in the sensitivity func-\ntion. This fundamental difference may lead us to expect differences with respect\nto robustness of the patterns, and hence the applicability of different mechanisms\nto biological pattern formation. Robustness here refers to pattern characteristics\nsuch as amplitude of the patterns and the parameter region in which they occur. For\nconstant sensitivity laws the amplitude of the patterns is very small, and they occur\nin a very restricted range of parameter space. However receptor laws produce larger\namplitude pattern and these patterns exist in a larger region of parameter space.\nThese results are significant when the underlying chemical concentrations are\nless regular. For kinetic parameters that lie in a small neighborhood of the point\nat which the Turing instability occurs in the chemical system the pattern is very\nregular since the power spectrum of the solution is dominated by the amplitude\nof the unstable mode. However, the pattern may be much less regular far from the\nprimary bifucation points.\nIn Figure 5 (a)\u2013(c) we display the chemical concentrations derived by numerical\nsimulation of the two dimensional reaction-diffusion system. The patterns illustrate\nthe two pattern types commonly observed in Turing systems: A hexagonal array ((a)\nand (b)) and stripes (c). Increasing the domain size in (a)\u2013(b) results in less regular\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 303\nFig. 5. Cell patterning under chemical concentrations obtained by numerical simulation\nof the Turing system. Left column shows heterogeneous steady state chemical patterns\n(v species) (a) Hexagons, \u03b48qwe = 2.8, \u03ba = 0.06, Du = 1.0,Dv = 0.0125, domain\n[0, \u03c0 ]\u00d7 [0, \u03c0 ]. (b) For the larger domain [0, 2\u03c0 ]\u00d7 [0, 2\u03c0 ], the hexagonal patterns show less\nregularity. (c) Stripe solutions for parameter values \u03b4 = 1.2,\u03ba = 0.06,Du = 1.0,Dv = 0.08,\ndomain [0, 5\u03c0 ]\u00d7[0, 5\u03c0 ]. Cell patterning under constant and receptor sensitivities are shown\nin the middle and right columns respectively. With the regular chemical concentrations (a),\nboth constant and receptor laws can demonstrate ring type patterns, however those obtained\nfor receptor law have a larger diameter and greater amplitude. Under less regular patterns\nsuch as the hexagons of (b) and the stripes (c), receptor laws can give clearly defined rings\nor thick and thin stripes, whereas no coherent pattern emerges under the constant laws\npatterning. The middle and right columns show the complex patterns produced in\nthe cell density for constant and receptor sensitivity laws, respectively. Constant\nlaws (d) produce rings of small circumference and amplitude. Receptor laws (g),\nhowever, produce large rings of large amplitudes. Furthermore, the region of \u03b1\u2212\u03b2\nparameter space over which these patterns are observed is much greater in the latter\ncase than in the former. This aspect is critical for the production of such patterns\non a large domain. A comparison of the last two columns shows that distinct rings\nof large amplitude (h) or alternating broad and narrow stripes (i) are obtained with\nreceptor laws, whereas no coherent pattern occurs for the constant sensitivity laws,\n(e) and (f). Thus non-constant sensitivities lead to more accurate tracking of the\nunderlying morphogen distribution.\n304 K.J. Painter et al.\n5. Applications\n5.1. Animal skin patterns\nA theoretical application of the Turing model is that of Murray ([23], [24], [25]), (see\nalso [2] and [40]), who considered a reaction-diffusion system as the underlying\nmechanism for pigment patterns on mammalian coats. A reaction-diffusion sys-\ntem establishes an underlying nonhomogeneous morphogen field which provides\nthe information for pigment cells to differentiate into a particular type depending\non the local morphogen concentration. This theory of pigmentation is attractive due\nto the similarity between patterns generated by the model and coat markings, but\neven a cursory glance through an encyclopedia of animal patterns yields exceptions.\nThese include alternating thick and thin stripes, which most notably occur in species\nof fish (e.g. the lionfish) or reptiles (for example, the tail of the gila monster), rings,\nwhich are commonly observed on species of wild cat such as the jaguar, leopard and\nocelot. More complex patterns include those shown by the thirteen lined ground\nsquirrel which display stripes interspersed with a line of spots.\n5.1.1. Animal markings through the hybrid model\nWe can apply the complex patterns exhibited by the hybrid model in the context of\nanimal coat markings. Essentially, we propose a mechanism whereby pigment cells\norganize themselves spatially via a chemotactic movement response to gradients\nof chemicals in the reaction-diffusion system. Further differentiation into a specific\npigment type may then arise through sensing a threshold of local cell density. Bio-\nlogical evidence suggests that the mechanism under which pigment cell precursors\nmigrate to dermal layers of the skin may be chemotactic ([10], [18], [21], [17]) and\nit is not an unreasonable suppositon to assume organisation of cells in the skin also\noccurs through chemotaxis.\nIn Figure 6, we compare patterns observed with the hybrid model with patterns\nseen on animal coats. Ring patterns obtained by numerical simulation of the model\nare compared with those on the jaguar, and broad and narrow stripes predicted by\nthe model are compared with the lionfish. Theoretically, a third type of common\ncomplex pattern was obtained in two-dimensions; the large and small spots shown\nin Figure 3(b). Both rings and broad and narrow stripes can be observed in large\nregions of parameter space (under receptor sensitivity laws), and are relatively\ninsensitive to the regularity of the underlying chemical kinetics \u2013 see section on\nrobustness above. The large and small spots, however show much greater sensitivity\nto the underlying pattern. Despite the appearance of such patterns in theory or under\nhighly regular chemical concentrations (such as in Figure 3(b)), they are less likely\nto arise in biological systems, where greater variation is to be expected. Intriguingly,\nthis may be reflected in pigmentation markings. Both rings and broad\/narrow stripes\nhave been observed on the skins of a variety of animals, yet we have been unable\nto find biological examples of the third type.\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 305\nFig. 6. Comparison between complicated animal skin patterns and patterns produced by\nthe hybrid model.

Bacterial chemotaxis\nWe now consider a simple model for pattern formation in bacteria (for exam-\nple, E. coli) in an environment containing two chemotactic substances. A detailed\nmodel for signal transduction of a single attractant at the individual cell level has\nbeen analyzed [36], but here we use a simpler continuum description that uses\nthe receptor-based schemes developed earlier. This model illustrates how differ-\nences in the local movement rules with two species leads to significantly different\nmacroscopic patterning. In one dimension, the cell density evolves according to the\nequation,\n\u2202n\n\u2202t\n= Dn \u2202\n2n\n\u2202x2\n\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nn\u03c71(u, v)\n\u2202u\n\u2202x\n)\n\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202x\n(\nn\u03c72(u, v)\n\u2202v\n\u2202x\n)\n(63)\nExperimentally, techniques have been developed which allow the creation of sta-\ntionary linear chemical gradients in chemotaxis chambers, [14]. Consequently we\nshall assume stationary chemical profiles of this type in the above model. The\nchemotactic sensitivity functions considered are derived using transitional rates\nof the types considered in Section 3, summarized here in Table 1. We choose\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 = 10.0,Dn = 1.0, k1 = k2 = k3 = 1.0. We assume an initially ho-\nmogeneous cell distribution, with no net flux of cells across the boundary. The\n306 K.J.

Competing attractant gradients\nChemoattractant gradients of u and v are plotted in Figure 7 (left). Here we as-\nsume competing linear attractant concentrations of equal slope and maxima. The\ncell density at the heterogeneous steady state under the sensitivities of Table 1 in\nresponse to these attractant gradients are shown in Figure 7 (right). When both\nattractants are assumed to bind to the same surface receptor (Type 1), the chemo-\ntactic fluxes balance, resulting in a homogeneous cell density (solid line, Figure\n7 (c)). For attractants binding to different cell surface receptors(Type 2 and Type\n3), however, cell density peaks emerge at a point between the maxima of the two\nchemoattractants (Figure 7 (a) = linear, Figure 7 (b) = nonlinear). The saturation of\nresponse at higher chemical concentrations results in a weaker chemotactic effect\nat these regions, and cells aggregate in the centre.\nBy varying the maximum concentration (and hence slope) of v, we observe\nfurther differences in the macroscopic cell density for the various sensitivity types.\nIn Figure 8, (a), we plot u (solid) and v (dashed) concentrations and now consider\nvarying the maximum of v, Vm. Cell densities under Type 1 sensitivities are plot-\nted in Figure 8 (b). With Vm < 1.0, the gradient of u is larger and u dominates\ncell movement. Consequently, cell aggregations occur at maxima of u. As Vm is\nincreased above 1.0, however, the gradient in v is stronger, resulting in switching\nthe cell aggregation to v maximum. A similar effect is observed for Type 2 sensi-\nFig. 7. Cell density response to competing attractant signals. Left: Chemical concentrations\nof u, solid line, and v, dashed line.

Results classified in\nterms of the position of the aggregation with respect to the high concentrations of u or v.\nNote that \u201cat u\u201d may mean the the aggregation is biased towards the higher concentrations\nof u, rather than at the maximum.

A completely different behavior\noccurs under Type 3 sensitivity functions, Figure 8 (d). Low values of Vm (e.g., 0.1)\ndecrease the effective response both to u and v. Consequently, a small aggregation\noccurs which is biased towards the maximum concentration of v. This may initially\nappear counterintuitive, however from Table 1 we see that for Type 2 sensitivities\nand v small, \u03c71 is small. A reverse effect is observed at larger values of Vm, e.g. 5.0,\nand the aggregation is shifted towards the u maximum. Here, a shallow gradient\ncan be detected by the cells, despite the presence of a much stronger second signal.\n5.2.2. Attractant gradient vs constant attractant level\nWe study the response to a single attractant gradient, yet with a uniform concen-\ntration of a second attractant. The forms for the concentrations of u (solid) and v\n(dashed) are plotted in Figure 9 (a), and once again we examine responses to the\nthree sensitivity laws under variation of Vm. At high concentration levels of v and\nType 1 sensitivities, cell aggregations at the u maximum is minimal, Figure 9 (b).\nThis occurs via high levels of v resulting in occupacy of the receptors which satu-\nrates the response. Decreasing Vm results in an enhanced aggregation. For Type 2\nsensitivities, the aggregation to v is the same, regardless of the level of Vm, Figure\n9 (c). The opposite behaviour to that described for Type 1 sensitivities occurs under\nType 3 sensitivity rules. Here, the aggregation in response to u is minimised at very\nlow levels of Vm, and maximised at high levels, Figure 9 (d).\n5.2.3. Summary of the bacteria response\nThe aggregation in response to two gradients demonstrates highly different be-\nhaviour, depending on the choice of sensitivity functions. These differences are\nsummarised in Table 2. Experimental techniques which allow the creation of linear\nattractant gradients in chemotaxis gradients may be used to test the effect of two\nattractant cues, and subsequently test which sensitivity functions may apply in real\n308 K.J.

Type 3 sensitivities assume that the transduction from external signal to\ninternal cell movement occurs via some nonlinear combination of the two attrac-\ntant cues. The response to v for these sensitivity laws demonstrates how cells can\nrespond to very low levels of a specific signal, despite the presence of stronger\nsignals from other sources.\n6. Discussion\nIn this paper we developed a model for the response of a cell population to two\ndistinct chemicals, either of which may be an attractant or repellant, and we an-\nalyzed some of the properties of this model. We generalized the Othmer-Stevens\napproach [29] by modeling the tactic response to multiple signals and considered,\nin turn, strictly local, barrier, and gradient models. We also considered several dif-\nferent types of chemotactic sensitivity laws, and demonstrated that when organisms\ncan respond to more than one chemical cue, the integration of signals via differ-\nent combinations of receptor based-response laws leads to many new behavioral\nresponses. We have shown that one manifestation of this more complex response\nis more complicated spatial patterns.\nFor instance, the model can exhibit spatial pattern of thick and thin stripes as\nwas shown earlier in a model that involves a single chemotactic substance [30], and\nCellular response to multiple chemotactic cues 309\nFig. 9. Cell density response to a single gradient, while another attractant is fixed at a uniform\nlevel. (a) Chemical concentrations for u, solid line, and v dashed line, concentration of v\ndetermined by Vm. (b) Cell densities under Type 1 sensitivities, (c) cell densities under Type\n2 sensitivities, (d) cell densities under Type 3 sensitivities\nwe suggest that this may be applicable in the context of animal coat markings. The\napplication to bacterial chemotaxis shows how signals may be filtered such that\nvery low levels of one stimulus can be detected in the presence of large gradients in\na second stimulus. We have also shown that certain types of sensitivity laws favour\nrobust patterning.\nThe patterns determined by the mechanism presented here derive from the\nlocal interpretation by cells of positional information provided by the nonuniform\nmorphogen distribution. Because cells respond by moving, this leads to global\npatterning and in essence, a non-local interpretation of the positional information.\nThis is in contrast to other models that do not involve chemotaxis, in which the\ncomplex patterns are obtained via the superposition of two linearly unstable modes\n[34,26] and the response is strictly local. These models can also generate complex\npatterns, but the one presented here is simpler: we rely on a single pattern generator\n(the reaction-diffusion mechanism) to create a spatially heterogeneous field and\nit is the subsequent interpretation of the field that forms the complex patterning.\nAn important question that modeling alone cannot answer is what mechanisms are\nused in a particular context.\n310 K.J. Painter et al.\n7. Appendix\nWe obtain analytical approximations for time independent solutions to the model\nbelow using standard bifurcation analysis (see, for example, Fife (1979) or Grindrod\n(1993)). On the scaled one-dimensional domain [0, \u03c0 ] the model is given by:\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n= \u2202\n2u\n\u2202x2\n+ \u03b3 2\n(\n\u03b4 \u2212 \u03bau\u2212 uv2\n)\n, (64)\n\u2202v\n\u2202t\n= d \u2202\n2v\n\u2202x2\n+ \u03b3 2\n(\n\u03bau+ uv2 \u2212 v\n)\n, (65)\nwith given initial conditions and zero flux at the boundaries. The parameter \u03b3\ncorresponds to a scaling of both spatial and temporal scales.\nThe homogeneous steady state solution for (64)\u2013(65) is given by (u0, v0) =(\n\u03b4\n\u03ba+\u03b42 , \u03b4\n)\n. We define f(u, v) = \u03b3 2\n(\n\u03b4 \u2212 \u03bau\u2212 uv2\n\u03bau+ uv2 \u2212 v\n)\n. The dispersion relation,\nobtained by looking for solutions of the form exp(\u03bbt+ikx) for the system linearized\naround the steady state (u0, v0), is given by\n(\u03bb(k2))2 + a(k2)\u03bb(k2)+ b(k2) = 0, (66)\nwhere,\na(k2) = (d + 1) k2 + \u03b3 2\n(\n\u03ba + v20 + 1\u2212 2u0v0\n)\n, (67)\nb(k2) = dk4 + \u03b3 2k2\n(\n1\u2212 2u0v0 + d\n(\n\u03ba + v20\n))\n+ \u03b3 4\n(\n\u03ba + v20\n)\n. (68)\nExamination of the dispersion relation, Equation (66), demonstrates that eigenval-\nues have positive real part for b < 0, where b is determined by Equation (68).\nAlgebraic manipulation of (68) gives b = 0 when:\nd = \u03b3\n2 (2u0v0 \u2212 1) k2 \u2212 \u03b3 4\n(\n\u03ba + v20\n)\nk2\n(\nk2 + \u03b3 2 (\u03ba + v20)) , (69)\nwhich is positive for k2 > \u03b3\n2(\u03ba+v20)\n2u0v0\u22121 . We take d as our bifurcation parameter. We\nlet k = j (\u2208 Z) and define d\u2217 to be the solution of Equation (69). Assume, as d is\ndecreased, that stability of the homogeneous solution is lost to the j th mode first.\nSetting d = d\u2217 \u2212 *2, for * small, we consider solutions (u, v) of the form:(\nu\nv\n)\n=\n(\nu0\nv0\n)\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nn=1\n*n\n(\nun\nvn\n)\n.
