I am especially grateful to \nSarah Deacon of RDS NOMS for coming to the rescue and providing the \nuseable dataset and a careful and clear guide to its construction.  Finally, I \nwould like to thank David Elliott for his advice on the analysis and being a \nwilling sounding board for my thinking about the results. \n \n \nBiographical note  \n \nCarol Hedderman is Professor of Criminology at the University of Leicester \nand a member of the Griffins Society Council. She was formerly Assistant \nDirector of the Home Office Research and Statistics Directorate (2002-2004) \nwhere she had lead responsibility for statistics and research concerning \nsentencing and the management and impact of the Prison and Probation \nServices. \n \nHow not to assess Probation Performance: constructing local \nreconviction rates \n \nThe government created the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) \nin the light of the first Carter Report\u2019s recommendation that the probation and \nprison services should be brought together to secure the \u2018end-to-end\u2019 \nmanagement of offenders (Carter, 2003).  The aim of that management \nprocess is to reduce reoffending.  Responsibility for delivering this objective \nhas been devolved to ten regional offices in England and Wales which are \neach overseen by a Regional Offender Manager (ROM) or Director of \nOffender Management (DOM).  The ROM or DOM is expected to achieve \nreductions in reoffending by overseeing the coordination of prisons, probation \nareas and other statutory and voluntary sector agencies (Home Office, 2004). \n \nIf local services and regions are to be held to account for securing reductions \nin reoffending, it follows that the effectiveness with which they do so should \nbe measured at a local and regional level. With this in mind, the research arm \nof NOMS has undertaken several annual rounds of a reconviction analysis \ndesigned to generate quarterly regional reconviction rates.  The results are \nnot yet in the public arena but they have been disseminated to regions for \nconsideration and comment. Part of the response from Probation Chiefs in the \nEast Midlands Region was to commission the current study, so that they \ncould consider the value of these results as a measure of local performance.  \n \nWhen this regional project was initially conceived, it was assumed that \nquarterly samples would be drawn using standard reconviction study \nsampling techniques, so the original plan was to supplement the centrally \nconducted analysis, for example, by comparing reconviction rates according \nto the type, conditions and length of community orders. When it became clear \ncross-sectional sampling had taken place, it was agreed that the primary \nfocus should be on assessing the value of reconviction rates based on cross-\nsectional data. This was to be followed by an examination of variation in \nprobation area caseloads within the East Midlands Region in terms of factors \nknown to affect reconviction such as age, sex, type of current offence, type of \nsupervision and criminal history. This article discusses the results of those \nanalyses.  \n \nUsing reconviction rates to assess the effectiveness of different \nsentences \n \nBefore considering the specific results generated by the current study, it is \nworth considering the general value of using reconviction rates to assess \neffectiveness.  \n \nIt is tempting to assume that one can assess the extent to which any given \nsentence, or intervention within a sentence, has reduced reoffending by \nmeasuring offending before and after a sentence has been imposed \n(Hedderman, 2007).  But, as Lloyd, et al., (1994) explain in their seminal \nstudy of reconviction, that is an impractical plan for a number of reasons.  \nFirst, it assumes that nothing else has influenced the change.  Second, it \nassumes that an offender would otherwise have maintained a steady rate of \noffending. Third, it is clearly not reasonable to compare the impact of a two \nyear period in custody with two years on a community order from the day both \nsentences were imposed, as the periods \u2018at risk\u2019 of further offending differ.1 \nFourth, we cannot measure reoffending directly, but use proxies such as re-\narrest and reconviction or self-reported offending which all distort the \nunderlying picture in some way. \n \nMair et al. (1997) even question whether it is appropriate to assess the impact \nof a sentence (or intervention within a sentence) in terms of aims it was not \nimposed to achieve; or to measure its success in relation to only one aim, \nwhen it was imposed to achieve several. Also, in practice, researchers can \nonly speculate on precisely how a reduction in reconviction was achieved \neven when an outcome study is accompanied by a well-conducted process \nevaluation. It is simply assumed that penalties which are intended to be \n                                            \n1\n Even taking acts against other inmates into consideration would not solve this problem as \nthe prison environment clearly limits an inmate\u2019s ability to commit specific types of offence \n(child abuse and car theft being among the most obvious).  \nrehabilitative have primarily worked in this way. Similarly, sentences which \nare intended to deter are assumed to have had a primarily deterrent effect.   \n \nThe lack of agreed and objective measures of incapacitation or general \ndeterrence (Moxon, 1998), also tends to limit most discussions of sentencing \neffectiveness.  For example, while the Carter Review (2003) concluded that \nthe increased use of custody probably made a modest contribution to crime \nreduction during the 1990s, this conclusion relied on (unpublished) statistical \nmodelling. It was not a directly observed relationship (Hedderman, 2006).  \n \nDespite the considerable conceptual differences in how incapacitation and \ndeterrence are expected to operate, reviews tend to conclude that their \neffects are not distinguishable from one another (Nagin, 1998; von Hirsch et \nal., 1999; Carter, 2003; Bottoms, 2004). Another common conclusion is that \nwhile increasing the use of imprisonment might lead to some additional \nincapacitative effect or marginal deterrence, increasing the risk of being \ncaught is a more effective way of securing crime reduction (von Hirsch et al., \n1999). This inability to distinguish one effect from another leads Friendship et \nal. (2004) to conclude that reconviction\u2019s value as an outcome measure lies in \nthe fact that, quite simply, it is often the only one available.   \n \nConventional approaches to conducting reconviction studies  \n \nThere are no universal standards for conducting reconviction studies but there \nare common conventions which have developed in England and Wales \nbecause these secure the most reliable and robust results.  Perhaps the most \nobvious example of this is that using reconvictions2 to measure reoffending is \ngenerally preferred to rearrest because the latter may be affected by \ndecisions other than proof of an offender\u2019s guilt (Lloyd et al., 1994).  For \nexample, when there is no clear single suspect, the police may arrest several \npotential candidates, some (or all) of whom may not be prosecuted or \nconvicted.  Similarly, the decision to re-imprison an offender may not be a \n                                            \n2\n A reconviction involves a further finding of guilt or an admission of guilt in court. \nresponse to reoffending but the result of a failure to attend probation \nappointments or a breach of licence conditions, so it is a less reliable \nmeasure of reoffending than reconviction. In the same way, while the use of \ntwo year follow-up periods has become the norm that is because, if an \noffender is reconvicted at all, this is most likely to occur - and result in a \nconviction - within such a timeframe.  In fact, most reoffending happens, if it \noccurs at all, within the first year of a community sentence being imposed or \nfollowing release from prison (Kershaw and Renshaw 1997a; 1997b). While \nreconviction periods which are shorter than two years give more timely \nfeedback, they are known to undercount serious offences because these take \nlonger to come to court and to be finalised. Even two years is not generally \nconsidered long enough for sex offender reconviction studies because such \noffences are harder to uncover (Beech et al., 2001).   \n \nAnother important convention is that reconviction studies adopt a longitudinal \nrather than the cross-sectional design more commonly employed in social \nresearch. The critical characteristic of a longitudinal design is that all of those \nin the sample and comparison groups are at the same stage of life or at the \nsame stage of an intervention.  Probably the most famous criminological \nlongitudinal studies are the Cambridge (e.g. Farrington et al, 2006) and \nPittsburgh (e.g. Loeber and Stouthamer-Loeber, 1998) birth cohort studies in \nwhich children born in the same year and the same location (South London \nand Pittsburgh, respectively) were followed up from birth in order to \nunderstand how and why individuals begin to offend and what personal, social \nand experiential factors are associated with persistence and desistance.  \nWhile it would have been both quicker and cheaper to take a cross-sectional \napproach in which different age groups at each site are sampled \nsimultaneously, this would yield less reliable results.  As the Economic and \nSocial Research Council\u2019s United Kingdom Longitudinal Research Centre \n(ULSC, 2008) explains on its website: a longitudinal approach is considered \npreferable when seeking to identify the causes of change and causal \nprocesses; when there is a need to exclude the potential effects of age and \ntime; and \u2018when establishing the effect of a \u2018treatment\u2019 by following an \nexperimental or quasi-experimental design or comparing periods before and \nafter the introduction of public policy\u2019. \n \nAdopting a longitudinal design for reconviction studies ensures that all those \nbeing compared are at the same point in a sentence and begin with the same \npotential follow-up period. As noted above, given that most reoffending occurs \nas supervision begins, it is important to ensure that this period is captured in \nfull for all cases in the sample.  Otherwise the comparison is not taking place \non a like-for-like basis. A longitudinal approach also ensures that the \nsequencing in which effects occur is unambiguous (Blumstein et al.,1988). \n  \nChoosing a longitudinal approach also ensures that the sample is robust by \nensuring that those sentenced or released on a given date will stand an equal \nchance of being included regardless of sentence length. In a cross-sectional \nsample, the chances of being included increase with time on supervision. This \nalso means that when further samples are being drawn, there is a risk that \nthese will be non-independent as those on longer sentences may be chosen \nagain. Adopting a longitudinal approach reduces the chances of this occurring \nas the same offender will only be included in subsequent samples if they have \nbegun a new community sentence or been re-released. .  \n  \nFor these reasons most reconviction studies undertaken by government \nanalysts and independent researchers in this country and elsewhere adopt a \n\u2018longitudinal\u2019 approach (see, for example, Home Office, 1993; Kershaw and \nRenshaw, 1997a; Kershaw and Renshaw, 1997b; Oldfield, 1997; Killias et al., \n2000; Spicer and Glicksman, 2004; Cuppleditch and Evans, 2005; Cunliffe \nand Shepherd, 2007).  This involves following samples of offenders on \ncommunity orders forward from date of sentence and prisoners forward from \ndate of release from prison. Under this approach, the definition of a previous \nconviction is simple and intuitive as it covers any convictions which relate to \noffences committed before the previous sentence date; and reconvictions are \nthose relating to offences which occurred after the date of sentence or \nrelease. It is sometimes necessary to exclude \u2018pseudo-reconvictions\u2019 which \nare convictions which occur during the follow up period, but which result from \noffences committed prior to the sentence of interest. These are excluded from \nreconviction studies because they are not a measure of the current \nsentence\u2019s effectiveness.   \n \nWhen comparing the reconviction rates associated with different types of \nsentence, across areas or over time, it is important to allow for differences in \nfactors known to associated with further offending (Kershaw and Renshaw, \n1997b; Cunliffe and Shepherd, 2007). The most commonly controlled factors \nare age, sex, age at first offence, nature and extent of previous offending and \nexperience of previous sentences.  This is mainly because these \ncharacteristics are known to be highly correlated with reconviction. \n \nAdopting the standard two year follow-up period means that any offence \ncommitted within twenty-four months will be counted as a reconviction, \nwhereas one committed after twenty-four months have passed will not. This is \ntrue regardless of whether the offender has moved from a pattern of rape and \nburglary to one of low-value shoplifting or escalated from taking and driving \naway to armed robbery. It may also miss \u2018some short-term impact which \n\u2018decays\u2019 into no difference in reconviction over two years\u2019 (Merrington and \nStanley, 2004:18). Unsurprisingly, numerous commentators (e.g. Lloyd et al, \n1994; Merrington and Stanley, 2004, 2007) have concluded that while the \nvalue of the single headline figure approach lies in its simplicity, this comes at \na price.  For these reasons, a number of recent studies include \nsupplementary or alternative measures which take account of the nature of \nsubsequent offending (e.g. Friendship et al., 2003); the time taken to reoffend \n(e.g. Sarno et al., 2001), the extent to which changes in offending are \nsustained (e.g. Cann et al., 2003); and the relationship between known \nreconvictions and self-report (e.g. Farrall, 2005). These additional measures \nare likely to assume greater importance as our understanding of reducing \nreoffending as a process of desistance3 increases.  \n \n \n                                            \n3\n See, for example, Farrall (2002) and McNeill (2006),  \nThe NOMS cross-sectional approach to generating local reconviction \nrates \n \nTo generate the data on which reconviction rates are calculated, probation \nareas are required to send data on cases on their caseloads on four quarterly \ncensus dates.  These returns are then matched to Police National Computer \n(PNC) information on known convictions or cautions relating to offences \ncommitted within three months and recorded on the PNC within six months.  \n \nThe protocols used to decide whether local or central information should be \nconsidered accurate when the local and central source conflicted were not \nreleased nor was any information provided on the extent to which such \nconflicts arose. However, judging from the crude categories used to describe \nethnicity and the fact that the nature of the principal offence was missing in \nbetween 11% and 21% of cases (see below), it seems likely that preference \nwas given to PNC data and that local information was over-written.  \nAlternative approaches might have included taking whichever source provided \nthe fullest record or creating rules to over-write or amalgamate data based on \nspecific criteria.  For example, if one source showed an offence as ABH and \nanother as GBH, the rule might either call for the more serious of two violent \noffences to be accepted or both could be combined as a principal offence of \n\u2018violence\u2019 or \u2018violence involving injury\u2019. \n \nDespite initial promises that creating local reconviction measures would be an \niterative and transparent process, it took eighteen months for an analysable \ndataset to be received. This comprised 49,720 records drawn from the East \nMidlands Region probation areas (Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, \nNorthamptonshire and Nottinghamshire) on four dates in 2006 (31 Mar, 30 \nJune, 30 September and 31 December).  Approximately 10% of the offenders \nbeing supervised by each area at each sample point were not matched on the \nPolice National Computer (PNC) where the reconviction data are held.4  \n \n                                            \n4\n The general consistency of matching over time and area means that the missing cases are \nunlikely to explain variation in reconviction rates. \nTable 1: number of cases under supervision per area and per sample  \n \nDerby- \nshire \nLeic & \nRutland \nLincs \n \nNorthants \n \nNotts \n \nEast \nMidlands \n31 March 2006 \n  \n30 June 2006 \n  \n30 Sept 2006 \n  \n31 Dec 2006 \n2764 2787 1451 1523 3901 12426 \n2700 2844 1462 1528 3823 12357 \n2675 2963 1527 1546 3701 12412 \n2708 2997 1526 1603 3691 12525 \nTotal 10847 11591 5966 6200 15116 49720 \nPercentage of  \nregional \nsupervision load \n22% 23% 12% 12% 31% 100% \n \nOnce the data were received it quickly became clear that initial plans to refine \nand add to the existing central analyses through more detailed local ones \nwhich looked at specific types of reoffending or which compared different \ntypes of sentencing were not worth pursuing.  The data simply did not provide \nan adequate or reliable basis.5 Instead the analyses focused on assessing the \nimpact of the decision to adopt such an unconventional approach to \nassessing reconviction.  In fact, the NOMS decision to take a cross-sectional \napproach to creating local probation reconviction samples and to the analysis \ncreated at least four serious obstacles to making sense of the results. These \nwere entirely predictable whereas the reasons for departing from the \nlongitudinal convention, aside from improved sample sizes, are unclear.6 \n \nFirst, sampling those who happened to be under supervision on a given date \nmeant that individuals in the sample had been sentenced days, weeks, \nmonths or even years before this date. The analysis presented in Table 2 is \nbased on the first 2006 snapshot date (31 March 2006).  This shows that 18% \nor about 1 in 6 community orders in the region were over a year old. The \nfigure for the full year\u2019s sample was also 18%.  However, some of the other \nquarters contained even greater variation between areas.  For example, the \nproportion of cases which had been supervised for more than a year in \n                                            \n5\n The usual demographic characteristics (e.g. age, sex, ethnicity) of the sample as a whole \nare not discussed at this point because they need to be understood in the light of the \nmethodological discussion provided.  \n6\n Of course, sample size issues can be addressed by sampling over a period rather than just \none day in a longitudinal study, with the follow-up period being extended in the same way. \nDerbyshire (24%) was nearly twice that for Lincolnshire (13.5%) in the \nDecember sample.  \n \nTable 2 Time elapsed between sentence date & 31 March 2006 by area \n Derby- \nshire \n% \nLeic & \nRutland \n% \nLincs \n \n% \nNorthants \n \n% \nNotts \n \n% \nEast \nMidlands \n% \n0-6  \nmonths \n50.6 54.0 56.3 50.4 56.5 53.9 \n7-12  \nmonths \n28.2 29.1 27.4 30.9 26.2 28.0 \n13 or more \nmonths \n21.2 16.9 16.3 18.7 17.3 18.2 \nNumber of  \ncommunity \nsentences  \n2348 2337 1242 1227 3248 10402 \n \nTwo out of every five licence cases in each snapshot had been supervised for \nover a year. For both community supervision and custody cases, variation \nbetween areas was highly statistically significant (P \u2264 0.0001).7  For example, \nthe average (mean) period which had elapsed between release and the first \nsnapshot date was 48 weeks in Leicestershire and Rutland, 51 weeks in \nDerbyshire, 57 weeks in Northamptonshire, 58 weeks in Lincolnshire and 70 \nweeks in Nottinghamshire. This means that some of those sampled were \nfollowed up from early in their \u2018at risk\u2019 period, while others were sampled as \ntheir likelihood of first reconviction was fading.  A sizeable minority, \nparticularly among custody cases, were sampled when their risk of first \nreconviction was negligible following years of supervision. The fact that \nindividual probation areas differed in this regard to a highly significant level in \nall four snapshots means that the chances of their reconviction rates falling \nwere unequal.  As it would be unfair and misleading to present individual \nprobation areas\u2019 results, Table 3 illustrates the consequences for all of those \non community sentences using the March 2006 cohort.  As expected \nreconviction rates fell as time since sentence increased. \n \n                                            \n7\n A result is referred to as being \u2018statistically significant\u2019 if the probability of it occurring by \nchance is less than, or equal to, 1 in 20 (P \u2264 0.05). \nTable 3: Three month reconviction rates according to time elapsing \nbetween sentence date & 31 March 2006 8 \n \nUp to 6 \nmonths \n            % \n7-12 \nmonths \n% \nOver 12  \nMonths \n                    % \nTotal \n \n                 % \nNo further offending 88.7 90.7 93.3 90.1 \nProven reoffence  11.3 9.3 6.7 9.9 \nTotal  N 5603 2911 1888 10402 \n \nTable 4 presents similar information for licence cases.  This comparison is \nlimited to dividing cases according to whether the time since release was \nmore or less than a year because of the smaller numbers and generally \nlonger supervision periods involved. The reconviction difference according to \ntime on supervision was only statistically significant for two snapshots (June \nand December) but the trend was the same in all four periods, with those who \nhad been on licence for less than a year being more likely to be reconvicted \nthan those who had been out in the community for longer.9  \n \nTable 4: Three month reconviction rates according to time elapsing \nbetween release date & 31 March 2006 10 \n 12 months and under \n% \nOver 12 Months \n% \nTotal \n% \nNo further offending 91.4 93.3 92.2 \nProven reoffence  8.6 6.7 7.8 \nTotal N 1100 879 1979 \n \nGenerally speaking, the more an area\u2019s caseload includes orders which have \nbeen running for a long time, the lower its reconviction rates are likely to be. \nThe importance of this lies in the intention to use area reconviction rates as \nperformance indicators.  In this context, the simplest option open to an area \n                                            \n8\n Given that the reconviction statistics for 2005  (Ministry of Justice, 2008) show that 38% of \nthose on community sentences were reconvicted within one year, a reconviction rate of 10% \nin three months may seem low.  However, after allowing for the effects of pseudo-\nreconvictions, changes in probation population and other differences in which community \npenalties were included in the comparison, this is remarkably consistent with Kershaw and \nRenshaw (1997b) finding that 15% of those on probation in 1993 were reconvicted within \nthree months, 46% within one year and 57% after two years.  \n9\n Fisher's exact test (1 sided) was used to test for significance in licence cases to allow for \nsmall numbers. \n10\n A three month reconviction rate of 9% is consistent with Kershaw and Renshaw\u2019s (1997a) \nfinding that 8% of those released from prison in 1993 were reconvicted within three months, \n37% within one year and 53% after two years. Reconviction statistics for 2005 (Ministry of \nJustice, 2008) show that 49% of adult offenders on released from custody were reconvicted \nwithin one year. See Hedderman (2008) for a discussion of why probation one year \nreconviction rates may have remained relatively stable over time while prison reconviction \nrates have grown so substantially. \nseeking to reduce its reconviction rates would be to encourage local \nsentencers to impose longer orders. This is a perverse incentive because this \nwould add to the costs of criminal justice without any beneficial effect on \npublic safety.   Both the community sentence and licence reconviction results \nsupport the conclusion that local reconviction rates would be more \nmeaningful, and less easy to manipulate, if they were based on cases \ncommencing supervision rather than snapshots drawn from caseloads.  \n \nIt is interesting to note that since these results were disclosed to NOMS an \n(unpublished) set of revised results covering March 2006 to June 2007 have \nbeen released to areas which takes account of time since sentence or \nrelease. This may ameliorate the problem but it will only solve it if it is the \npassage of time which reduces reconviction, rather than the changes to \noffenders\u2019 attitudes and behaviour during that time, which affect likelihood of \nreconviction.  In other words, this statistical correction may suppress the \nimpact of not comparing like-with like, but it does not address the basic issue \nwhich has led to other reconviction studies adopting a longitudinal approach.  \n \nAllowing for time since sentence or release also will not solve a second \nrelated problem created by adopting a cross-sectional approach which is that \nit compromises the validity of any comparison between actual reconviction \nrates and standard predictors of reconviction which calculate risk from the \ndate of sentence. In other words, as Blumstein et al. (1988) point out, it \ncreates ambiguity in the time line, as age and experiences may have affected \nthe risk of reconviction between the date for which it was calculated and the \ndate to which it was applied.   \n \nA third  - predictable - problem created by the cross-sectional snapshot \napproach concerns the extent to which any single individual appear in the four \nsnapshots. Those on very short orders (any under three months) did not \nstand an equal chance of being sampled in any quarter as they were \nexcluded if they began and completed supervision after one snapshot ended \nand another began.  It follows that certain types of orders are more likely than \nothers to be missed (e.g. those involving short periods of community \npunishment). On the other hand those on longer sentences were more likely \nto be sampled in more than one quarter. In practice, this meant that the \noverall sample of 49,720 cases for the East Midlands Region in 2006 related \nto only 21,554 individuals of whom more than two thirds (68%) appeared in \nmore than one sample. Table 5 shows that three quarters (76%) of those who \nappeared in one snapshot appeared in at least one other. The fact that the \ndifferent samples often contained the same people dramatically limits the \nextent to which changes in reconviction over time can be expected. Once \nagain area differences were statistically significant which means that the \nimpact this had on reconviction will vary between them. \n \nTable 5: the extent of overlap between offenders in each snapshot   \n \nDerby- \nShire \n% \nLeic & \nRutland \n% \nLincs \n \n% \nNorthants \n \n% \nNotts \n \n% \nEast \nMidlands \n% \nOne snapshot \n  \nTwo snapshots  \n  \nThree snapshots \n  \nFour snapshots \n13.6 13.0 14.5 14.1 14.8 14.0 \n22.8 22.4 23.2 22.6 24.6 23.3 \n22.5 25.0 26.9 23.2 24.7 24.4 \n41.2 39.6 35.4 40.1 35.9 38.4 \nTotal Percentage 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 \nTotal N 10847 11591 5966 6200 15116 49720 \n \nThe fourth major problem created by NOMS\u2019 decision to take a cross-\nsectional approach is that it has led to questionable decisions being made \nabout what to count as a previous conviction and what to count as a \nreconviction. In line with standard reconviction study protocols any incident \nwhich occurred in the three months following a snapshot date which resulted \nin a caution or conviction within 6 months of the snapshot date is counted as \na reconviction; and any offence which occurred before the snapshot date was \ntreated as a previous conviction. However, because the snapshot date was \nnot the sentence or release date this means that any offence which occurred \nbefore the snapshot date but which had occurred during the same period of \nsupervision is counted as a previous conviction. Put simply, this convoluted \napproach leads to the measure of previous convictions over-counting \noffending and the measure of reconviction undercounting offending. Following \nthe logic of this approach means that an offender who appears in all four \nsnapshots who offended during the first three but not in the fourth will appear \nas a \u2018success\u2019 in the final snapshot as the offender\u2019s previous failures during \nthe same order will all be treated as previous convictions by that point.  \nIndeed the offender may well be seen to be outperforming his or her expected \nreconviction rate if the three previous failures form part of the risk of \nreconviction calculation. Unfortunately, too little information is provided in area \nreports to know quite how the predictor is calculated. \n \nOther factors which may affect an area\u2019s reconviction rates  \n \nGiven the limited caseload turnover between samples, it is unsurprising that \nthe profile of each area was stable over time on all demographic, offending \nand sentencing factors. Areas were similar to each other in terms of the \npercentage of women (13%) on the caseload; average age (mean= 31 \nyears\/median = 29 years).   \n \nThe ethnicity of 86 per cent of the regional sample was classified as \u2018White \nEuropean\u201911, but underlying this were large differences between areas.  For \nexample, less than two per cent of Lincolnshire\u2019s probation caseload was \nclassified as Black or Minority Ethnic (BME) and no BME group was \nsignificantly more common than another.  In contrast, one in five of those \nbeing supervised in Leicestershire and Rutland were from a BME group and, \nwhile.  \u2018Asians\u2019 (12%) comprised the largest single BME group in \nLeicestershire and Rutland, the \u2018Afro-Caribbean\u2019 group was also \ncomparatively large (8%). Nottinghamshire had a similar proportion of Afro-\nCaribbean offenders (9%), but supervised a much smaller percentage of \nAsian offenders (3%).  The only significant change in an area\u2019s ethnic profile \nover time occurred in Nottinghamshire and was explained by an increase in \nthe proportion of cases where ethnicity was unknown (3.4% to 7.4%).    \n \n                                            \n11\n The crude (even offensive) ethnic codes included in the data indicate that  \u2018ethnic \nappearance\u2019 as recorded by the police on the PNC was used in preference to local probation \ninformation.  \nThe caseloads of areas also varied significantly in the extent to which they \ncomprised those on community sentences or released from prison, with \nDerbyshire having the lowest proportion of licence cases and \nNorthamptonshire having the highest (see Table 6). This may contribute to an \nexplanation of differences between area reconviction rates. \n \n Table 6: variations in supervision by area (all time periods) \n  \nDerby- \nShire \n% \nLeic & \nRutland \n% \nLincs \n \n% \nNorthants \n \n% \nNotts \n \n% \nEast \nMidlands \n% \nCommunity \nSupervision \n85.4 83.9 85.1 81.3 82.9 83.7 \nLicence \n \n14.3 15.8 14.6 18.3 16.8 15.9 \nMixed or \nmissing \n.3 .3 .2 .3 .4 .3 \nTotal N 10847 11591 5966 6200 15116 49720 \n \n \nAlthough all the areas varied in their use of different community sentences, \nDerbyshire\u2019s and Northamptonshire\u2019s supervision cases also seemed to differ \nfrom the other three areas in that, proportionately, they supervised more \nCommunity Rehabilitation Orders (CROs), fewer Community Punishment and \nRehabilitation Orders (CPROS) and fewer sentences imposed under the \nprovisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 sentences than the other three \nareas.  There are several potential explanations for this including: errors in the \ndata; that Derbyshire and Northamptonshire were supervising a less serious \ncaseload; and\/or that they were supervising offenders on longer orders.  The \nfact that the disparity in the use of these different community sentences grew \nover time supports the idea that sentence length is a factor. \n \nJust under a quarter (23%) of the cases under supervision in the East \nMidlands region involved violence.  The next most common offences were \ntheft and handling (10%), drink driving (8%), other motoring offences (8%) \ndrugs supply and possession (7%) and public order (6%). Other offences all \ncomprised less than 5% each of area caseloads.  Underlying these averages \nwere important area differences, particularly in relation to violence, burglary, \nsexual offences, drink driving and theft (see Table 7). Of course, the nature of \noffending is known to be related to likelihood of reoffending, so any \nmeaningful comparison between areas\u2019 reconviction rates would need to \nallow for these differences.  Further analysis showed that offence seriousness \nmay have played a part in the different supervision pattern discernible in \nNorthamptonshire.  This area supervised a much higher proportion of drink \ndrivers than average. However, Derbyshire\u2019s cases which, like \nNorthamptonshire, involved more CROs than average, involved a fairly typical \ndistribution of offences. \n \nTable 7: The nature of the principal offence leading to current \nsupervision by area (all time periods) \n  Derby \nshire \nLeic  \n& \nRutland \nLincolns Northants Notts East  \nMidlands \nViolence 24.8 24.1 21.8 21.4 22.1 23.0 \nBurglary 3.1 2.9 4.0 3.5 5.5 3.9 \nSexual 4.5 5.0 5.8 6.1 4.5 5.0 \nDrink \ndriving  \n7.1 7.0 8.8 12.1 7.6 8.1 \nTheft 9.4 9.2 11.8 9.4 10.6 10.1 \nAll other 30.5 33.5 34.8 31.1 39.0 34.3 \nUnknown 20.6 18.3 13.0 16.4 10.7 15.6 \nTotal 100 100 100 100 100 100 \nTotal N 10847 11591 5966 6200 15116 49720 \n \nEighty seven per cent (43,457) of the cases being supervised involved \noffenders who had one or more previous convictions or a pre-court disposal \n(caution, warning or reprimand). Excluding those who had only experienced a \npre-court disposal meant that 84% of the total caseload could be counted as \nconvicted recidivists.  Once again, however, there were statistically significant \ndifferences between areas, with Northamptonshire\u2019s caseload containing a \nsignificantly lower proportion of previous offenders and Nottinghamshire \nsupervising a much higher proportion.  Table 8 shows that this pattern was \nconsistent over the four quarters, reflecting the fact that the samples often \ncontained the same people.  \n \nTable 8: the proportion of the caseload with previous convictions by \narea (all time periods) \n \nDerby \nShire \n% \nLeic & \nRutland \n% \nLincs \n \n% \nNorthants \n \n% \nNotts \n \n% \nEast \nMidlands \n% \nNo previous \n \n16.3 16.8 16.2 19.0 14.4 16.3 \nPrevious \nconvictions \n83.7 83.2 83.8 81.0 85.6 83.8 \nTotal  N 10847 11591 5966 6200 15116 49720 \n \nInformation was provided on length of criminal career in 41,676 cases. Of \nthose with criminal records, less than 7% had begun offending in the last \nyear, with half the recidivists having previous offending careers of 10 or more \nyears.  The maximum length of criminal careers appeared to range from 52 \nyears in one area to 105 in another!  Given that a small number of inaccurate \nentries might lead to quite misleading comparisons, differences between \nareas, or within areas over time, have not been presented. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe fact that more than four out of five cases in the 2006 local reconviction \nsample appeared in more than one quarter\u2019s sample is a predictable \nconsequence of cross-sectional sampling, given that the average length of \ncommunity orders nationally was 22 months by the end of 2005 (Home Office, \n2006). This inevitably severely limits the degree to which changes in \nreconviction each quarter should be expected. Given that we know that most \nreconviction happens within the first year of a community sentence being \nimposed or post-release, the value of the results is also limited because up to \na quarter of an area\u2019s community sentence cases and well over a third of their \nlicence cases had been under supervision for over a year by the time they \nwere sampled.  Areas also varied considerably in both these respects in each \nsnapshot and over time.  \n \nOther important differences between areas were identified in the nature of the \nprincipal offence, the proportions on licence or under a community sentence, \nthe types of community sentences being supervised and the extent to which \ncases involved offenders with previous convictions. On this basis, it would \nseem unwise to use quarterly figures based on such snapshots of the \nsupervision caseload to compare areas\u2019 reconviction rates at any given point \nin time or over time. As a minimum, if NOMS insist on pursuing a cross \nsectional approach, comparisons should be limited to sub-samples of typical \ncases matched on factors known to affect reconviction which had been under \nsupervision for less than a year. However, even this would not overcome the \nmain disadvantage of taking a cross-sectional approach, which is that it \ncreates perverse incentives, particularly if funding is linked to improvement.  \nUnder the current approach, an area can improve its results over time by \nencouraging sentencers to impose longer sentences. This will not affect \npredicted rates but will improve actual rates.  Other less obvious strategies, \nwhich it would be irresponsible to describe, could also be devised which are \nequally unlikely to actually make the public safer, but would lead to even \ngreater \u2018improvements\u2019 in an area\u2019s reconviction rates. \n \nThe preferable, more conventional, longitudinal approach would be to \nproduce reconviction rates based on supervision starts (commencements) \neach quarter with cases being followed up after six months, one year and two \nyears. This would not in itself control for differences in demographic and \ncriminal profile differences between offenders, but it would ensure that within-\narea samples were independent and eliminate the gap between sentence or \nrelease date and the start of the follow up period. Over time the data could \nalso be used to create genuinely local reconviction predictors rather than the \ncurrent approach which is based on national figures.  Although probation area \nis taken into account in the national predictor, the current approach may \ndisadvantage smaller areas such as Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire \nwhose cases will have contributed less to the cohort on which the predictor \nwas modelled.  \n \nAdopting a longitudinal approach would ensure that local reconviction rates \nare less susceptible to manipulation. Examining the reconviction rates of \ncommencements rather than caseload snapshots has a number of other \nadvantages in monitoring and measuring performance. First, the six month \nreconviction figure would provide timely feedback on the work which is \nactually undertaken with those being supervised as this is the period during \nwhich National Standards requires supervision to be most intensive. In \ncontrast, the current approach implicitly assumes that all those being \nsupervised experience an equivalent level of intervention no matter how long \nthey have been on the caseload. Second, by conducting six month and one \nyear follow-ups, results would be generated concerning the period in which \nprevious studies have shown that reconviction is most likely (the first year).  \nThird, follow-ups of the same cases at two years would show whether short \nterm effects were sustained.  Fourth, basing reconviction rates on supervision \nstarts would provide speedy feedback on changes in sentencing behaviour \nand release policies. Both of these are being masked in the current approach \nby the inclusion of offenders who have been under supervision for a long \ntime. Fifth, all orders of less than three months duration would be included as \na matter of course.   \n \nThe open and consultative approach adopted by NOMS\u2019 reconviction analysts \nshould ensure that the most appropriate measures of reconviction are \nconsidered, but the final decision is unlikely to lie with data analysts. In these \ncircumstances it is worth concluding with a few cautionary words about any \nreconviction measure.  \n \nReconviction rates should not be left as the sole measure of success. They \nare crude proxies for reoffending and a very blunt tool for measuring the \ndesistance process. However, even if other accepted measures are \ndeveloped, it is likely that reconviction rates will remain a key measure of area \nperformance. How well they fulfil that role depends on a whole range of \ntechnical decisions about what is measured and how.   To tease out the \nspecific effect of supervision on reoffending requires allowing for who is \nreceived under supervision in different areas and over time.   \n \nNOMS\u2019 decision to depart from the standard approach to reconviction was no \ndoubt affected by the knowledge that most consumers of local reconviction \nrates feel at least baffled, and possibly even distrustful, when anything other \nthan simple, actual reconviction rates are discussed. The ultimate question, \nwhich is unlikely to be left to the analysts, is whether transparency or \naccuracy should be prioritised. The results of this further analysis \ndemonstrate the dangers of giving too much precedence to the former and \ntoo little to the latter.   \n \n \n \nReferences \n \nBeech, A., Erikson, M, Friendship, C. and Ditchfield,J.
