These may be physical \nbarriers, such as impermeable exoskeletons, through physiological adaptation \nto molecular and biochemical responses. All have evolved in tandem with the \nniche adaptation of the species and enable survival within constrained \nenvironmental limits. So far, the best-characterised transcriptional stress \nresponse is that of elevated production of heat shock proteins (Gross, 2004). \nThese are a family of highly conserved proteins, which act as chaperones to \nstabilise and refold  denatured proteins,  preventing the formation of cytotoxic \naggregates (Parsell and Lindquist, 1993, Hartl, 1996, Fink, 1999). Numerous \nfamilies of heat shock proteins have been identified, the naming of which is \nrelated to their weight in kiloDaltons. The most studied of these family \nmembers is the 70kD heat shock proteins (HSP70s) (Ritossa, 1962), \ncomprising constitutive forms (HSC70: heat shock cognate 70) and stress \ninducible family members (HSP70s: heat shock protein 70) (reviewed in \nMorimoto, 1998). Whilst their action has been described in response to a wide \nvariety of stresses, the classical activation of the HSP70 genes is in response \nto elevated environmental temperatures.  \n \nThe induction of these genes does come with a caveat, in that HSP70 gene \nexpression is highly plastic. Levels of induction are influenced by thermal \nhistory such as seasonal temperature cycling, vertical zonation and \nbiogeography (Somero, 2002; Hofmann, 2005). This heat shock plasticity \nphenomenon is well characterised in eurythermal organisms, but has also lead \nto great interest in the response of Antarctic marine organisms, which have \nmore restricted thermal limits. These animals are highly stenothermal having \nsurvivable temperature envelopes between 5\u00b0C and 12\u00b0C above the minimum \nsea temperature of \u20131.86\u00b0C (Somero and DeVries, 1967; Peck and Conway, \n2000; Peck 2002). This range of upper lethal\/critical temperatures was \ndetermined experimentally, as the organisms live almost permanently within a \n4\u00baC temperature envelope. Data from the RaTS (Rothera Time course Series) \nLong Term Monitoring Programme shows that the waters around the Antarctic \nPeninsula vary between a minimum of \u20131.8\u00b0C in the winter to a maximum of \n+1.7\u00b0C in the height of the austral summer (data provided by Professor \nAndrew Clarke). Shallow seawater temperatures along the west Antarctic \nPeninsula have risen in excess of 1\u00b0C over the last 50 years (Meredith and \nKing, 2005). While the IPCC Third Assessment climate model predicts  a \nfurther 2oC increase in global seawater temperatures over the next 100 years, \nalbeit with large regional variations and confidence intervals.  In light of \ncurrent and predicted seawater temperature increases Antarctic stenotherms \nare therefore at considerable future risk of seasonal exposure to ambient \nwater temperatures that exceed those known to result in the loss of critical \nbiological functions (Peck et al, 2004). \n \nGiven what was known about heat shock protein induction in eurythermal \nfish, the initial prediction for the heat shock induction temperature of \n \nHSP_Harpagifer 4\nAntarctic marine organisms was close to the maximum environmental \ntemperature. Surprisingly, it was found that members of the Antarctic \nNototheniidae family completely lacked the classic heat shock response (up-\nregulation of HSP70 expression) (Place and Hofmann, 2005). Although two \nother animal species to date have been shown to lack this response Hydra \noligactis (Bosch et al, 1988) and an Antarctic ciliate Euplotes focardii (La \nTerza et al, 2001; 2004), the fish situation is complex.  The inducible form of \nHSP70 is permanently expressed (Place et al, 2004). It is thought that \npermanent expression of chaperone proteins is an adaptation to survival in \nthe ice-laden Southern Ocean and the consequential biological problems of \ninefficient protein folding at such low temperatures (-1.86\u00b0C) (Place et al, \n2004). This observation is substantiated to a certain extent by the constitutive \nexpression of HSP70 in the distantly related Antarctic fish Lycodichthys \ndearborni (Figure 1). However, this zoarcid can still up-regulate HSP70 \nexpression when exposed to 4\u00b0C (Place and Hofmann, 2005). \n  \nRecent data (Clark et al, submitted) on the heat shock response of Antarctic \nmarine molluscs has shown that the classical heat shock response is \nsignificantly and reproducibly initiated in both Nacella concinna and Laternula \nelliptica at 15\u00baC. This is a temperature far in excess of that which could be \nexperienced by either of these molluscs or indeed other Antarctic marine \norganisms even under the most extreme predictions of elevated seawater \ntemperatures as a result of global climate change predictions. Previous \ninvestigations of Antarctic fish species\u2019 heat shock response have only taken \nthe animals to a maximum of 10\u00baC (Hofmann et al 2000). \n \nThe questions then arise as to whether up-regulation of HSP70 can occur in \nAntarctic fish at an elevated temperature of 15\u00baC? Whether constitutive \nexpression of HSP70 is a general phenomenon across all Antarctic fish \nspecies? Is the inability to up-regulate HSP70 in response to heat specific only \nto the Nototheniidae family or is this phenomenon present more widely in the \ninfraorder Notothenioidei?  \n \nIn this study three members of the HSP70 gene family comprising the \nconstitutive (HSC70) and inducible (HSP70) members, plus GRP78 (Glucose-\nregulated protein, 78kDa) a related HSP70 family member were cloned using \ndegenerate PCR from the Antarctic plunderfish Harpagifer antarcticus (family: \nHarpagiferidae). The expression of the HSP70 family members was surveyed \nvia Q-PCR after an acute two-hour heat shock experiment at both 10\u00b0C and \n15\u00b0C and also a time course experiment at 6\u00b0C. The data are discussed in the \ncontext of general cellular metabolic constraints under stressful conditions. \n \n \n \nMethods \n \n \nHSP_Harpagifer 5\n Animal sampling and experimental work  \nAll H. antarcticus used in the experimental work were collected at Rothera \nResearch Station, Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula (67o 34\u05f3 07\u05f4 S, 68o 07\u05f3 \n30\u05f4 W) by SCUBA divers during the austral summer. The fish were collected \nand immediately returned to the laboratory where they were maintained in a \nthrough-flow aquarium under a simulated natural light:dark cycle. Predicted \nsunrise and sunset times (POLTIPS 3, Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory) \nwere used in conjunction with a mechanical timer to control the lighting \nregime. During the time the animals were held in the aquarium the water \ntemperature was 0.75\u00b10.00oC. H. antarcticus were fed chopped white fish \nmuscle (Notothenia coriiceps) twice per week to satiation.  \n Acute heat shock experiments: Animals were maintained for 5-7 \ndays in the aquarium prior to experimental work. Groups of 5 animals were \ntransferred to the experimental tanks. The fish were exposed to a thermal \nshock, by immediate transfer to seawater maintained at a range of \ntemperatures (-0.5oC (\u00b10.07oC) (control), 10.0oC (10.16\u00b10.07oC) and 15 oC \n(\u00b10.1oC) for 2 hours. After the 2h thermal shock the animals were killed \naccording to approved Home Office protocols, weighed (\u00b1 0.1g), measured \n(\u00b10.1mm) and tissues collected and placed in RNA-Later (Ambion, USA) for \nsubsequent analysis. 200mg samples of white muscle, liver and digestive tract \nwere collected from each fish. \n Time course heat shock experiments: H. antarcticus were \nreturned to the UK in a refrigerated transport aquarium and maintained in a \nrecirculating aquarium at close to 0 oC until required for experimental work. \nAnimals were fed twice per week on chopped white fish or krill to satiation \nand maintained under a light:dark period of 12:12 hours. Thirty five fish were \ntransferred to the experimental tank at time zero and maintained at 6.0 \u00b1 \n0.08oC. Five animals were killed according to approved Home Office protocols \nat zero, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours and 200mg of liver removed and placed \nin RNALater for subsequent analysis. Animals were measured and weighed as \ndescribed previously. \n \nSample Analysis \n RNA extraction and isolation of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) genes: \nTotal RNA was extracted from liver, white muscle and digestive tract using \nTRI Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1\u03bcg of \ntotal RNA was DNase treated using 0.4U DNase I (Ambion) in 10mM \nDTT\/100mM MgCl2 buffer and reverse transcribed using a first strand \nsynthesis kit (Promega). Degenerate primers for HSP70 were designed from a \nprotein alignment of HSP70 genes from a variety of species ((H. sapiens to \nmolluscs) and amplified a 500 bp fragment comprising amino acids 30-125 \n(motifs used for primers: IIANDQGD and TVPAYFNN) (Table 1). PCR cycling \nconditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C 5 minutes, 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C 20 seconds, \n60\u00b0C 20 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 40 seconds with a final elongation step of 72\u00b0C \nfor 5 minutes. Products were subcloned into p-GEMT-easy (Promega), \ntransformed into E.coli strain XL-2 Blue MRF\u2019 (Stratagene) and a minimum of \n48 clones sequenced. Sequence data was assembled using the phred, Phrap \nand consed packages  (Ewing et al, 1998; Gordon et al, 1998). Consensus \n \nHSP_Harpagifer 6\nsequences were database searched using WU-blast2 (WU-blastx) (Altschul et \nal, 1997) against Uniprot (Boeckmann et al, 2003; Wu et al, 2006) to assign \ntheir HSP identity. The nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal W \n(Thompson et al, 1994) and specific primers designed for each different \nmember of the HSP family, all with an annealing temperature of 60\u00b0C. \nAmplified fragment sizes varied between 143bp and 145bp. The specificity of \neach of the primers was checked, by amplification and sequencing of the \nproducts.  \n Isolation of \u03b2 actin genes: To allow for a comparative analysis to \nbe made between the different HSP genes, a housekeeping sequence \u03b2 actin \nwas isolated from H. antarcticus. Primers previously designed to the Takifugu \nrubripes \u03b2 actin gene family (Venkatesh et al, 1996) (Table 1) were used to \namplify 500bp heterologous sequences from H. antarcticus using the following \nPCR conditions: 95\u00b0C 5 minutes, 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C 20 seconds, 60\u00b0C 20 \nseconds and 72\u00b0C for 40 seconds with a final elongation step of 72\u00b0C for 5 \nminutes. PCR products were sequenced, assembled and checked as described \nabove for the HSP genes. Fragments of two members of the \u03b2 actin gene \nfamily were cloned, but primers were designed to the predominating clone \n(86% of clones). Primers were designed to anneal at 60\u00b0C. Expression levels \nof \u03b2 actin between different tissues and different treatment states were \nchecked to ensure constant expression and reproducibility. Sequences of all \nprimers are listed in Table 1. All HSP sequence fragments have been \nsubmitted to the EMBL database with the accession numbers AM293602-\nAM293604 inclusive. \n Sequence analysis: Sequence manipulation and analysis was \nperformed using the EMBOSS suite of open source software (Rice et al, 2000) \nhttp:\/\/emboss.sourceforge.net. \n Q PCR: HSP and actin sequences were amplified under each \ntreatment condition using specific primers, Brilliant SYBR\u00ae Green QPCR \nMaster Mix (Stratagene) and an MX3000P (Stratagene). PCR conditions were \nas follows: 95\u00b0C 10 minutes, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C 1 minute \nand 72\u00b0C for 1 minute with a final dissociation curve step as per \nmanufacturers recommendations. The plate set-up for each Q-PCR \nexperiment consisted of 5 control individuals and 5 experimental (\u201ctreated\u201d) \nindividuals amplified with a specific HSP primer set (designated Expt 1) and \nan actin control primer set (designated Normaliser).  Actin was used as the \nhousekeeping reference sequence as it had previously been shown not to \nchange under the experimental conditions used (data unpub). Each HSP and \nactin amplification was performed in triplicate. Each primer set was checked \nto ensure that no primer dimers were produced during the course of the \namplification reaction. RSq values and PCR efficiencies were checked over a \nfour fold 10x dilution series and the values calculated using the MxPro - \nMX3000P v 3.00 Build 311 Schema 74 software (Table 1). Primers producing \nlow RSq values were discarded and new primers designed. Amplifications \nwere analysed using the MxPro - MX3000P v 3.00 Build 311 Schema 74 \nsoftware and Ct (dR) values (threshold cycle of the baseline subtracted \nfluorescent reading) exported into Excel. The differences in Ct (dR) scores for \nthe control actin and HSP amplifications and also for the treated actin and \n \nHSP_Harpagifer 7\nHSP amplifications were derived and recalculated to include the PCR \nefficiency. These results were subjected to a 2-sample t-test using MINITAB \nv14 to determine the 95% confidence range. Relative expression ratios of the \nHSP and actin genes between the control and treated samples were derived \nusing the Relative Expression Software tool (REST) (http:\/\/www.gene-\nquantification.info\/), which incorporates the Pfaffl method and also uses a \nPair Wise Fixed Reallocation Randomisation Test (Pfaffl, 2001; Pfaffl et al, \n2002). This Excel macro was also used to calculate the significance level of \nthe fold changes. The data was then subjected to Fisher\u2019s method for \ncombining probabilities (Fisher, 1954). \n \n \nResults \nThree members of the HSP70 gene family were cloned and identified from H. \nantarcticus; the inducible form (HSP70, the constitutive form (HSC70) and \nGRP78 (Glucose-regulated protein, 78kDa). These were initially defined \naccording to their sequence similarity scores after searching the sequence \ndatabases using WU-BLASTx (Table 2). The designation of the inducible form \nwas narrowed further to HSP70-2 by comparison to the two duplicated \nplatyfish HSP70 genes (accession numbers: Uniprot: Q8UWN0 and \nUniprot:Q8UMM9). The H. antarcticus sequence fragment showed 86.2% \nidentity to the platyfish HSP70-2 gene, with a lower level of identity (80.7%) \nto the platyfish HSP70-1 gene. Only one member of the inducible form of \nHSP70 was cloned from H. antarcticus in spite of performing two additional \nsets of PCR amplifications from 10\u00b0C treated animals and several \namplifications from genomic DNA (data not shown). To obtain a crude \nestimate of the relative expression levels of each of the HSP genes in H. \nantarcticus, the genes were assayed using standard PCR and gel \nelectrophoresis in a set of control animals (data not shown). All three genes \nwere permanently expressed in liver, white muscle and digestive tract with no \nreal quantifiable tissue-specific expression. In the 10\u00b0C acute 2-hour heat \nshock experiments, 5 out of the 9 tissue sample\/primer combinations showed \ndown regulation of gene expression, these included both liver and digestive \ntract amplified using HSC70 primers and all of the GRP78 amplifications \n(Figure 2). This result was mirrored in the 15\u00b0C acute heat shock experiments \n(Figure 3). Up-regulation of gene expression was minimal (maximum 3.4 fold \nat 10\u00b0C and 5.97 fold at 15\u00b0C for HSP70) and well within the boundaries of \nexperimental variation, when considering the 95% confidence interval ranges. \nApplication of Fisher\u2019s method for combining probabilities on each of the two \ndatasets is consistent with no detectable effect of temperature on HSP gene \nexpression (see figure legends for probability data). Over the period of the \n6\u00b0C time course experiment all sample\/primer combinations showed effective \ndown regulation of gene expression. The general trend in the gene expression \npattern was of a gradual decrease to a maximum down regulation level, \nfollowed by recovery. However, even after 48 hours, expression levels of all \ngenes under study had not returned to pre-experimental levels. The time \npoint at which maximal down regulation occurred varied according to the \n \nHSP_Harpagifer 8\ngene: 8 hours for HSC70, 12 hours for HSP70 and 24 hours for GRP78 (Figure \n4). \n \n \nDiscussion \nThis study details for the first time, the cloning and expression profiles of \nHSP70 gene family members from an Antarctic fish over both acute heat \nshock experiments and an elevated temperature time course. Two types of \nheat shock were used, the first of which was acute at both 10\u00b0C and 15\u00b0C for \ntwo hours. This experiment was carried out to mirror previous Antarctic fish \nheat shock experiments and provide a point of reference for the time course \nassay. Previously Antarctic fish have only been heat shocked to 10\u00b0C \n(Hofmann et al 2000). Although the temperatures used are 8\u00b0C and 13\u00b0C \nabove their natural environmental temperature, data from Antarctic \ninvertebrates (Clark et al, submitted) shows that these latter organisms \npossess a significant and reproducible heat shock response at 15\u00b0C. Whilst \nthe heat shock response is an acute phenomenon that occurs within minutes \nof stress (Linquist, 1986), it has also been previously documented that \nAntarctic fish may have a depressed\/slowed stress response in terms of \ncatecholamine synthesis levels and that cortisol may not be an important \nstress hormone in these species (Davison et al, 1995; Whitely and Egginton, \n1999). Hence they may have a slower stress response compared to that \nmeasured in temperate animals. Therefore a longer lower temperature heat \nshock (6\u00b0C) was carried out as a time course series of 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 \nhours to ensure that a longer mRNA activation time may be detected. This \ntemperature was chosen with reference to previous work on the upper lethal \ntemperatures of Notothenioids (Somero and DeVries, 1967).  \n \nThree HSP70 genes were isolated and nomenclature assigned using database \nsequence similarity searching.  Only one inducible form of HSP70 was \ncharacterised from H. antarcticus. This is very interesting as evidence from \nother organisms suggests that there are multiple copies of this family member \nin most genomes surveyed to date (Voellmy et al, 1985; Hunt and Morimoto, \n1985; Ali et al, 1996; Milner and Campbell, 1990). Studies in fish indicate that \nat least two HSP70 paralogues are present in each species (Yamishita et al, \n2004), probably the result of a fish-specific gene whole genome duplication \nevent (Amores et al, 1998), as the duplicated genes are present across 4 \norders of fishes within the Euteleostei. The H. antarcticus gene corresponds \nto the HSP70-2 isoform. Previous work on Antarctic fish HSP70 gene \nexpression has only indicated the presence of a single gene, albeit detection \nwas via probe hybridization onto Northern blots and this technique would not \nnecessarily be able to discriminate between very closely related paralogues \n(Place et al, 2004; Place and Hofmann, 2005, Hofmann et al, 2005). \nPossession of additional members of the inducible HSP70 gene in H. \nantarcticus cannot be discounted, as they may be present in a very restricted \ntissue or developmental range. However, The identification of only a single H. \nantarcticus HSP70 gene so far, is not surprising given previous examples of \ngene loss in Antarctic fish (c.f. haemoglobin and functional erythrocytes in \n \nHSP_Harpagifer 9\nicefish (Cocca et al, 1995; di Prisco et al, 2002; Hureau et al 1977; Barber et \nal 1981) and the modification of expression patterns from temperate fish \nspecies (discussed below). But it does suggest a restriction in overall \nfunctional capacity, the reasons for which remain to be elucidated. \n \nH. antarcticus displays both the constitutive expression of HSP70 and the \nabsence of a reproducible classical heat shock response via up-regulation of \nthe HSP70 genes in response to increased environmental temperatures as \ndemonstrated previously in several other Antarctic fish species (Hofmann et \nal, 2000; Place and Hofmann, 2005). To date the lack of up-regulation of \nHSP70 has only been demonstrated in the Antarctic Nototheniidae. The data \npresented here add another data point for Antarctic fish species extending \nthis finding across three members of the Antarctic Notothenioidei (Figure 1). \nThis potentially indicates that the mutation resulting in the lack of HSP70 \ninduction in the Antarctic Notothenioids occurred before their diversification, \nbut after the separation of the Bovichtidae (which have the classical heat \nshock response) and the migration of the New Zealand Notothenioids from \nthe Southern Ocean (Carpenter and Hofmann, 2000).  \n  \nIn addition to the constitutive expression of the inducible form of HSP70, \nGRP78 is also strongly constitutively expressed (a situation identified in the \nAntarctic molluscs: Nacella concinna and Laternula elliptica (Clark et al, \nsubmitted)). GRP78 has been shown to be constitutively expressed in rainbow \ntrout cell lines, but at a relatively low level, compared that identified in our \nexperiments (Ojima et al, 2005). This provides an increasing body of evidence \nto support the theory that constitutive expression of heat shock proteins may \nbe a compensatory mechanism for coping with elevated protein damage at \nlow temperatures. There is some evidence that protein degradation rates \nappear comparatively higher and protein synthesis rates lower in \ninvertebrates at polar water temperatures than in species living at warmer \ntemperatures (Fraser et al. 2002; Fraser and Rogers, in press). Other studies \nhave also shown elevated levels of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in polar \nfishes, a likely indication of increased levels of denatured proteins at polar \nwater temperatures (Place et al. 2004). Taken together this evidence \nsuggests that transcribing, translating and folding proteins at polar water \ntemperatures may be problematic. Indeed, cold denaturation of proteins is \nwell known (Privalov, 1990) and exposure of endotherm cells and ectotherms \nto cold shock can induce HSP70 expression (Ali et al., 2003; Laios et al. \n1997).  \n \nH. antarcticus does not show any significant up-regulation of heat shock \nprotein activity above the level of individual variation\/experimental noise for \nany of the family members surveyed at either the acute temperatures or over \nthe time course. There are wide 95% Confidence Intervals in all the data and \nsome results which show large fold increases in gene expression are still not \nsignificant at the 95% level using the Pair Wise Fixed Reallocation \nRandomisation Test in the REST software (Pfaffl, 2001; Pfaffl et al, 2002) or \nFisher\u2019s method for combining probabilities. The wide confidence intervals are \n \nHSP_Harpagifer 10\na result of enforced experimental design and animal sampling: repeat \nsampling of animals before and after treatment was not possible. Thus \nanalysis of 5 \u201cpaired\u201d results was in fact analysis of ten different individuals. \nThe work was carried out on non-interbred, non-model organisms and implicit \nin this is the problem of high inter-individual variability (also noted in Place \nand Hofmann, 2005). So care has to be taken in interpreting Q-PCR results \nfrom these animals, with general trends being more important indicators \nrather than absolute figures. \n \nThe overall trend for all members of the HSP70 gene family examined in this \nstudy is down regulation. This is particularly the case with the time course \nresults, which are a more accurate reflection of thermal stress compared to \nthe very quick (in some ways, artificial) acute heat shock experiments at \nelevated temperatures. In the time course, this down regulation is followed \nby indications of recovery to \u201cnormal\u201d levels. There is clearly a reaction by H. \nantarcticus  to thermal stress, but there is also evidence that at least some \nAntarctic fish can acclimate successfully to higher temperatures such as 4\u00b0C \n(Carpenter and Hofmann, 2000; Lowe and Davidson, 2005; Jin and deVries, \n2006, Podrabsky and Somero, 2006).  \n \nThe reason for this general down-regulation of HSP genes cannot be \ndetermined given this set of experiments and the limited gene set. However, \nthere are three potential reasons:  \n\u2022 There is a general down-regulation of all genes under these conditions. \nAlthough tests on \u03b2 actin as a housekeeping sequence for Q-PCR show \nno change in expression levels with treatment. \n\u2022 Small temperature increases above 0\u00b0C may improve protein stability, \nreducing the requirement for HSPs until a higher threshold is released  \n\u2022 A more selective process is occurring with down regulation of \u201cnon-\nessential\u201d genes, whilst other genes more vital to cell survival are up \nregulated. Certainly experiments in invertebrates indicate that oxygen \nlimitation is a significant factor in physiological responses to \ntemperature (Frederich and P\u0151rtner, 2000) and it may well be that \nhypoxic genes are up regulated at the expense of most others. \nThis down regulation trend is particularly acute for GRP78. During the time \ncourse experiment GRP78 expression falls by over 100 fold and this was \nconfirmed by duplicate experiments on both the same samples and newly \nisolated cDNAs. To date, most of the work on this gene has been carried out \non mammals and the results of work on fish cell lines after heat shocking \nhave been contradictory so far. Ojima et al (2005) reported no change in the \nexpression of this gene in rainbow trout cell lines, whilst Yamashita et al \n(2004) showed up-regulation of GRP78 protein in heat shocked platyfish cell \nlines. Comparing results from cell line studies and whole animals is \nproblematic and should be interpreted with caution. Our results on whole \nanimals present a further alternative with constitutive expression at \u201cnormal\u201d \ntemperatures and down regulation of this gene in immediate response to heat \nshock.  \n \n \nHSP_Harpagifer 11\nGRP78 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is a classic marker of the \nunfolded protein response with an HSP-like chaperone function (Sommer and \nJarosch, 2002). It is up regulated under conditions of glucose starvation \n(Hendershot et al, 1994). Therefore, in addition to the three potential reasons \nfor gene down-regulation outlined above, there are two other possible \nreasons, which may contribute to the massive down regulation of GRP78 \ncompared to the other genes. GRP78 is not classically induced under heat \nstress conditions and in theory would not be expected to alter in expression \nlevel with thermal stress. However, in marine organisms, any increase in \nwater temperature is associated with a decrease in oxygen content of the \nwater (an approximate 2% decrease per degree) and therefore hypoxia is \nalso potentially an additional stressor (Hochachka et al, 1996). Up-regulation \nof carbohydrate metabolism and production of glucose has been shown in \nhypoxia experiments with Gillichthys mirabilis (Gracey et al, 2001) and daily \ntemperature fluctuation in Austrofundulus limnaeus (Podrabsky and Somero, \n2004). Up-regulation of glucose would inhibit GRP78 expression. Also \npreliminary microarray sequence screening provides a further antagonist for \nGRP78 expression with identification of the Diablo gene, a protein which \nactivates caspases and is involved in the apoptosis pathway. Gene Ontology \ndata (Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000) (http:\/\/www.geneontology.org) for \nGRP78 includes not only chaperone activity, but also caspase regulator \nactivity (GO:0043028), more specifically caspase inhibitor activity \n(GO:0043027). Potentially these two genes (GRP78 and Diablo) are \ninteracting in the activation\/inhibition of apoptosis under stress. If Diablo is \nup-regulated, GRP78 would consequently be down regulated. More \ncomprehensive microarray analysis will be needed to define this potential \nrelationship between these two genes. \n \nIn summary, this work describes for the first time, the cloning and expression \nprofiles of HSP70 gene family members from an Antarctic fish, H. antarcticus.  \nThe metabolic complexity of any organism is balanced within a confined \nbiochemical envelope constrained by cellular energetics. In the case of HSPs \nthis is a cost-benefit trade-off between successful protein folding (and re-\nfolding) compared to other essential cellular metabolic activities. Heat shock \nproteins help protect against the unfolded protein response in extreme \nenvironmental temperatures, but there are potential negative effects, such as \nimpacts on growth, development rate and fertility (Krebs and Loeschcke, \n1994; Silbermann and Tatar, 2000; Sorensen et al, 2003). In these Antarctic \nfish, HSP70 proteins are produced continuously whilst in other temperate \nspecies their production is tightly regulated and they are only produced when \nthe organism is under stress. This suggests that Antarctic fish have extra \nhousekeeping costs compared to temperate species associated with the \nexpression of the inducible HSP70s. The ability to further up-regulate HSPs \nunder stressful conditions could potentially have deleterious effects in terms \nof cellular energetic costs if the net benefits of protein stability are \noutweighed by the energetic costs (Sorensen et al, 2003). Experiments are \non-going in our laboratory to further dissect the intricate nature of the heat \nshock response in this fish species. A DNA microarray containing HSPs has \n \nHSP_Harpagifer 12\nbeen produced in our laboratory and will be used to provide a more detailed \ndescription of the complex biochemical reactions underlying this process. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper was produced within the BAS Q3 LATEST and BAS Q4 \nBIOREACH\/BIOFLAME core programmes.
