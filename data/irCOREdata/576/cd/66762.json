I hope to unpack some \nof the implications for current work and suggest how it follows through a constructionist agenda \u2013 \nin terms of seeing people discursively creating their worlds, seeing the field as discursively \nconstructed and indeed both the fieldwork and field worker as socially constructed. I want to \ninterrogate the limits of contemporary practice which I have suggested tends towards being \u2018a cross \nbetween ontological constructivism and epistemological realism\u2019 {Crang, 2001 #366, page 221}. \nThat is, we acknowledge the (co-)construction of the field by researcher and researched  where \n\u2018fieldwork is a discursive process in which the research encounter is structured by the researcher \nand the researched\u2019 {England, 2001 #795, page 210}. This is not to say people are writing \nclassically realist ethnographies, but geographers tend to still push criteria of logical consistency \nand reliability that depend upon notions of realistic representation. So this report will begin with \nsome textbooks to look at the state of play with qualitative methods. Then it will turn to the notion \nof the construction of knowledge through work on autobiography. Then I want to follow through \nsome of the methodological issues raised by approaches engaging with performative, embodied and \nhaptic knowledge, and finally visual approaches. Through this I want to ask whether methods often \nderided for being somehow soft and \u2018touchy-feely\u2019 have in fact been rather limited in touching and \nfeeling. Rethinking notions of feeling will also be suggested as a way of working at the thorny issue \nof the dominance of certain forms of vision \u2013 or after Hal Foster  {Foster, 1988 #783} visuality in \nthe discipline. Building upon the theme of last year\u2019s report, though let me start by discussing the \nconsolidation of qualitative methods in geography through some notable textbooks and guides. \n \nConsolidating texts \n \nWe might look at the state of play through five textbooks which speak to qualitative methods to a \nmajor extent and two or three other methods texts of note. Shurmer-Smith \u2018Doing Cultural \nGeography\u2019 {Shurmer-Smith, 2002 #782} is a collection, heavy on the pedagogic aids favoured by \npublishers, written by a small group of closely connected authors, which provides a clear linkage of \ntheoretical approach with methods. I am not here going to assess its utility for teaching \u2013 though I \nshould quickly say it has much to commend it \u2013 instead look at the range of approaches it suggests. \nBeginning with a helpful setting up of theory as something that is to be done rather than learnt as \nsome fixed map of positions, the book goes on to put humanism, Marxian thought, post-\nstructuralism, post-colonialism and feminism into play. It proceeds logically from there into the \nempirical \u2018doing\u2019 of research \u2013 linked elegantly by a discussion of framing questions. Framed \naround the sub-discipline of cultural geography the book is able to pluralise and contextualise the \n\u2018how to\u2019 issues of methods. Thus by including discussions of official statistics (Brown), archival \nwork (Hannam), and textual analysis (Shurmer-Smith) the book pushes us to desanctify or at least \nopen the relationship of research with specific we might say privileged modes of fieldwork and thus \nfield sites. The collection does include what we might call a more standard suite \u2013 participant \nobservation, interviews (single and group) (Bennett), field observation (Shurmer-Smith and \nShurmer-Smith) and feminist method (Ekinsmyth). Indeed Bennett\u2019s chapter really pushes the \nquestion of what \u2018being there\u2019, as Geertz might put, in the field, means in terms of the production of \nknowledge and producing the authority of the researcher. The final section of the book raises a good \nmix of issues about producing something out of materials \u2013 from more conventional \u2018analysis\u2019 \nthrough to a frank discussion of the possibilities and limits of pluralising \u2018outputs\u2019  - where some \ndisplay media are not really very helpful (I did like the brutal, short and effective commentary on \nstudent posters) and others such as performances run into problems of academic acceptability. Less \nspecifically focused upon qualitative methods but with a similar argument about the linkage of \nmethods and theory is Hoggart, Lees & Davies \u2018Researching Human Geography\u2019 {Hoggart, 2001 \n#799} that comes from a more economic and social urban geography bent \u2013 but remarkably enough \nmaps into many of the same methods and structures in two chapters devoted to interviews \n(individual and group) and participant observation (including action research), and one on archival \nwork. A similar connection between theory and practice is the evident concern of Pamela Moss\u2019s \ncollection \u2018Feminist Geography in Practice\u2019 which moves from the positional towards the \nmethodological. Most of the chapters are supported by personal case studies, and while occasionally \nvariable in quality they present an engaging and accessible set of guides and ideas for students. \nPersonally I found the closure of each section with \u2018study material\u2019 fairly unhelpful since it seemed \npitched somewhere between rhetorical and ineffable questions and then project-type exercises, and \nthe boxed research tips at the end of chapters were too schematic to function as more than aide-\nmemoires (one starts first bullet point in a list \u2018make a cold call\u2019, then point two \u2018use your \nnetworks\u2019) but I know publishers do push this sort of stuff into texts. Some of the issues raised in \nspecific chapters I want to discuss in the following section.  \n \nThere are also two collections solely devoted to qualitative methods in geography. My library has \nfinally received Iain Hay\u2019s collection \u2018Qualitative Research Methods in Human Geography\u2019 {Hay, \n2000 #821}. This pitches straightforwardly at the student market with an extensive glossary, \nbeginning by positioning qualitative work and traditions then proceeding to specific methods. \nWinchester in positioning qualitative work suggests three streams, starting with \u2018oral methods\u2019 \n(from biographical to survey interviews), then textual analysis, then participative approaches \u2013 and I \nwould highlight that this means quite a \u2018wordy\u2019 balance{Winchester, 2000 #836}. The methods \noutlined then resolve into interviewing \u2013 focussed upon semi-structured approaches, but with nice \nmaterial on listening strategies {Dunn, 2000 #814} -  thence to focus groups {Cameron, 2000 \n#812}and participant observation which offers some helpful sections on observation  the \u2018field\u2019  as \nembodied interaction {Kearns, 2000 #828}, before looking at textual analysis {Forbes, 2000 #815} \nwhich draws on semiotic and visual analysis. Then perhaps most helpfully, the book concludes with \na chapter on the politics and poetics of writing up reports {Berg, 2000 #811}, putting a tortured \ndebate in clear prose with good sections for students on objectivity, the first person and \npositionality.  \n \nFinally, there is Dwyer and Limb\u2019s \u2018Qualitative Methodologies for Geographers: Issues and \nDebates\u2019 {Limb, 2001 #801}. I have to declare a small conflict of interest here as a (tardy and \nminor) contributor to this collection, but overall the book aims for a more reflective approach than \nis common for \u2018how to\u2019 books \u2013 tending to dwell on dilemmas and issues a little more than usual, \nwith less exposition and advocacy. As such the essays are not designed as the first source but \nperhaps better used as opening out issues once students know the basics. It concludes with an \ninteresting range of 5 vignettes of undergraduate research projects which are really interesting of \nthemselves, though I have a slight fear that they may prove all too successful \u2018inspirations\u2019 to \nstudents. Again, I will pick out specific issues from chapters later, but it is worth noting what this \navowed state of the art summation says about qualitative methods in the discipline. Implicitly, the \nconfidence to develop critical discussions, to put chapters advocating different lines next to each \nother suggests we are beyond a phase of novelty for qualitative methods (for my sins I should fess \nup to my argument over the predominance of and problems with grounded theory being rather put \nin its place by Peter Jackson\u2019s elegant use of discursive repertoires {Jackson, 2001 #787;Crang, \n2001 #366}). But of course the editors have to select in order to avoid doorstop proportions, and so \nthey list methods {Limb, 2001 #386, 5-6} they see as core coming up with four main clusters. First, \nthere are \u2018in-depth open ended interviews\u2019 with individuals or groups, one off or repeated, \nbiographical or other. Second there are group discussions, one off or consecutive \u2013 though this \nclearly overlaps with the first category. Third, there is participant observation which may be overt \nor covert, active or passive, partisan including a \u2018variety of ethnographic techniques\u2019 such as \nparticipant diaries or \u2018other interactive exercises\u2019. Fourth, there are interpretations and analyses of \nvarieties of texts, be they archival, maps, literature or landscape and \u2018visual materials including \npictures, films, advertisements and dramatic performances\u2019. This last group they later (page 13) say \ncannot be fitted in the book, which is fair enough. And yet, it does rather suggest that the book \nmight almost be titled \u2018verbal methodologies for geographers\u2019. My point is not to berate the editors \nfor a choice that I suspect does indeed reflect the balance of work done, but to point out that this is \nsomething of a limited menu \u2013 with the two fascinating chapters about participant observation \n{Dowler, 2001 #803;Parr, 2001 #802} mostly focusing upon access. Otherwise we get clear \nsections on interviewing, group work, interpretation and writing. I would suggest this indicative of a \ncontext where it is almost becoming de rigeur for a \u2018qualitative\u2019 thesis to include semi-structured \ninterviews, and students get almost twitchy if they do not have at least a few \u2013 to at least \ncomplement participant observation or some other method \u2013 and I even have postgraduates asking if \na \u2018qualitative\u2019 thesis has to have focus groups. That said, the range of topics covered from children, \nto race, to politics, to health, to consumption, to rural women, to the environment, to science fiction \nreaders is really sparkling. In the rest of this report then I wish to start by engaging with the issues \nof positionality that come through these collections before moving towards methods less practiced. \n \nPositioning the Researcher \n \nI confess I have become rather weary of student work containing a paragraph of apologia (normally \nfor their whiteness and middle classness) before proceeding with business-as-usual for their \ndissertation. And I am also rather sceptical of work that divides positionality in qualitative research \nformulaically into being insiders (good but impossible) and outsiders (bad but inevitable). \nThankfully much work this year has developed beyond these approaches to further examine what \nare the very real issues around the relationship of researcher and researched. Perhaps at its starkest, \nmost painful and strident Smith has recently developed an extended critique of the relationships of \nresearcher and fourth world, aboriginal or as she prefers \u2018indigenous peoples\u2019 where \u2018research is \nprobably the dirtiest word in indigenous people\u2019s vocabulary\u2019 {Smith, 1999 #798, page 1}. In some \nsenses it makes familiar arguments from much anthropology of the last twenty years, however its \nsalutary outlining of the way histories of symbolic and physical violence intertwine is well worth \nreading \u2013 especially the cautions as to whose agenda is being pursued, and the elegant, pointed and \ntragicomic accounting for how \u2018systematic\u2019 research often bore more relationship to haphazard \namateurism than it could countenance. The book also develops an agenda focusing upon an agenda \nfor what she calls a \u2018modernist resistance struggle\u2019 (page 107) focused around indigenous agendas, \nknowledge and participation. Smith offers a realistic account of the possibilities to engage with \ncommunities and develop sympathetic work at a variety of scales and also for researchers to open \ncracks in previous research structures, working within the system. Skelton meanwhile illustrates \nhow a corporeal raced identity comes through in elements of comportment and tacit skills marking \nout \u2018outsiders\u2019 even as they try and show respect to local custom {Skelton, 2001 #792}. \n \nThe ambiguities, productivities and difficulties of such work comes through in the rather different \nwork of Routledge on tourist development in Goa. He engaged in quite deliberate deception and, \nindeed, illegal activities as part of cooperation with local NGOs \u2013 utilising the resources at his \ndisposal in part to overcome their learnt distrust of, or at least distaste for, researchers {Routledge, \n2002 #418}. Posing as a tourist agent to interview developers Routledge\u2019s work clearly violates \nnearly all the standard ethical protocols about informed consent and honesty, while at the same time \nclearly honouring obligations to the partner NGOs. The frisson of danger and transgression is a \nguilty pleasure that is acknowledged, as overall the project highlights the multiple roles of \nresearcher, collaborator, activist and publicist as they are played out. Routledge draws on a wide \nrange of skills as academic author writing for the NGOs, as an experienced activist, as a researcher \nand as access point to university resources \u2013 with as he admits different degrees of success \ndepending upon the criteria used to judge the work by peers, by locals, by NGOs and so forth. What \nthis highlights is the limits of increasingly prescriptive and formulaic ethical protocols, often being \ndriven by Human Subject or Ethical Review Boards, in situations of unequal power and in Goa bad \nfaith by developers engaging themselves in illegal, as well as exploitative, actions. In a less extreme \ncase Bradshaw points out the limits of the often proposed criteria for ethical engagement with those \nbeing researched \u2013 that of \u2018member checks\u2019, where participants get a right of veto or reply over the \nresearch interpretation {Bradshaw, 2001 #414}. He points to the problems when this is applied to a \nlarge multinational who, perhaps unsurprisingly, objected to a critical account of their activities \u2013 \nresulting in the work being embargoed. Dowler meanwhile researching the Northern Irish conflict \nends up pointing up both her own \u2018strangeness\u2019, despite shared aspects of identity with catholic \nIrish participants, and the banality and ordinariness of interacting with the Provisional IRA \n{Dowler, 2001 #803}. Delph-Janiurek illustrates how misunderstandings and crossed-assumptions \nlitter fieldwork {Delph-Janiurek, 2001 #428} while Valentine explores the multiple assumptions of \nwho is inside and outside particular research groups, and the assumptions made by participants \nabout researcher identities and the multiplicity of both sets of identities that render simple dualisms \nuntenable {Valentine, 2002 #785}. While on the other hand Mohammad raises a series of questions \nof who gets positioned as \u2018authentically\u2019 able to speak on behalf of \u2018Othered\u2019 groups when she \nunpacks how her skin colour, and assumptions about her identity and beliefs, gave her a sometimes \ndubious access and authority to research and represent British Muslim experience {Mohammad, \n2001 #791}. \n \nThese intractable issues put in context laudable goals of say establishing commonality as suggested \nby Al Hindi. She points out that there is an inevitable problem of difference in research where \n\u2018people wish to learn from and about others because the latter are different from the former, but the \nfact of difference itself may distance them from one another, making such understanding \ndifficult.\u2019{Al-Hindi, 2002 #784, page 106} and suggests a solution through reflexive practice. Here \nshe attempts to by pass the criticisms Rose made of this strategy in this journal {Rose, 1997 #804} \nby arguing that Rose conflated a positivist reflectivity, striving for transparency through \nintrospection, with a transformative feminist reflexivity where both sides reflect back their mutual \n(mis-?)understandings. While this may work in some circumstances it seems to me to rather miss \nthe point about the limits of understandings in unequal situations where our understandings of their \nunderstandings of our understandings are not only bound together, but unstably threaded through a \nrange of different performances in different contexts by all parties. My concern is that too often \nprotocols on disclosure and indeed reflexivity tend to depend upon and reproduce problematic \nnotions of the stable tightly defined unchanging research project conducted by a singular researcher, \nwith one stable essential identity, both between locations and over time, and quite often suggest the \nlatter is also true of the researched. If different roles do appear in different contexts they are often \nportrayed as circumstantial clothing, dressing ourselves inevitably less rather than more honestly to \nconceal some actual or ulterior purpose or identity. While deception can and does occur, from both \nparties, it is also quite important to recognise that our projects are often unstable entities which \nactually exist in multiple versions given to funders, colleagues, friends, family, peers and (different) \nrespondents none of which need be necessarily the \u2018true one\u2019, and then that we are more or less \nunstable, at least in the sense that we may change not only between locations but over time as we \nlearn from doing our work and as Routledge cites Gerry Pratt the researchers themselves are \nconstituted \u2018within a fragmented space of fragile and fluid networks of connections and gaps\u2019 \n(page\u2026). The transformative nature of research upon the researcher is indeed almost a trope in \nitself but serious attention to these trajectories has not always been sustained.  \n \nSome recent work has though begun to push the autobiographical trajectory of researchers as of \nimportance to the projects they undertake, especially the collection by Moss {Moss, 2001 #421}. \nThus there are the accounts of life experiences and background and their often painful, certainly \ncomplex negotiation with academic agendas leading to specific research approaches {Gilmartin, \n2002 #647;Knopp, 2001 #420;Saltmarsh, 2001 #646}. Amongst these the use of background as a \nresource that is read by informants, used and portrayed by researchers, that enables and disables \ncontacts in complex patterns comes through rather than simple notions of membership of a \ncommunity. David Butz discusses how his research in Pakistan included local community attempts \nto reshape his identity and indeed to partially incorporate him into local attempts to represent \nthemselves, as a specific audience then as collaborator, during a long period of field work and how \nthese in turn have informed his theoretical approaches {Butz, 2001 #644}. Alternately Ian Cook \nprovides an elegant and salutary account of autobiography coming to be the research, as part of \nproblematising the \u2018extended field\u2019 and subjecting the people and practices of the academy to the \nsame scrutiny normally reserved for field work, partly for practical reasons, partly to unpack \nnotions of the exotic other, used in marketing marketing exotic fruit, and valorising research. His \nPhD ended up being focused on the production of knowledge about exotic fruit including, indeed \nespecially, through research, including his own, and what he calls the \u2018cultures of cleverness\u2019 in \nacademia. As he comments \u2018a lot of people have told me it was a brave thing to do, writing that \nkind of PhD. Desperate is the word I prefer to use. As I said earlier, I didn\u2019t set out to write an \nautobiographical PhD. It was supposed to be about a fruit.\u2019 {Cook, 2001 #419, page 118} And of \ncourse this opens up the limits of whether constructivist ontologies of the world do not lead to a \nself-reflexivity producing an infinite regress. Thus Malcolm Ashmore produced a doctorate about \ndoing his doctorate, following the inescapable logic that sociologists of science have pointed out \nscience constructs facts not finds them, but sociologists have tended to claim that insight as a \nfinding, rather than itself a construction of sociology, though of course Ashmore\u2019s own insight \nabout this is itself, he is quick to point out, a construction {Ashmore, 1989 #46}. What Cook\u2019s work \npoints to is not just this logic but where Murphy claims auto-ethnographies \u2018serve to tell stories \ncollectively about \u201cour tribe\u201d, that is, who we are and what our rites and rituals are within academic \nculture\u2019 and thus how we might argue that within \u2018this current atmosphere of publish or perish, \nthere is much pressure to perform, and the result in what is now broadly considered ethnography is \noften a tendency toward stylistic command over representation and the textualization of \u201cthe real\u201d\u2019 \n{Murphy, 2002 #729, page 251}. If we follow this analysis, and I would be reluctant to do so, we \nsee the risk of \u2018a moment of ethnographic hypocrisy, a systematic rewarding of style over substance \nby trading in the rites of the field and the voice of the Other for the art of the prose and the \nexamination of the Self\u2019 (page 252). Less pejoratively, it is certainly the case that the definition of \nan ethnographic self through field practice is something that in itself would resonate equally with \nclassically trained ethnographers. It is to field practice that I would like to turn now to consider \napproaches that emphasise the performative and haptic nature of qualitative work. \n \nPerformative and haptic approaches \n \nThe dominance of verbal approaches in qualitative work is understandable after the discursive or \ntextual turn across the social sciences, and the focus upon the construction of the field which entails \nthinking of the field as composed of activity and practice. One tradition that has pursued this notion \nfor a long time is an ethnomethodological one, studying the maintenance of everyday life as a social \naccomplishment. Inspired by this tradition Eric Laurier has looked at \u2018neighbouring\u2019 as an \n\u2018occasioned activity\u2019 rather than a neighbourhood as defined by residential proximity, to unpack the \nnotion of \u2018public space\u2019 as massively coded and structured. This work has thus been based on \nobservation in key locales \u2013 such as a neighbourhood caf\u00e9 - and following the life of a small part of \nthe city, through such apparently inconsequential events as \u2018lost cat\u2019 notices {Laurier, 2002 \n#107;Laurier, 2001 #417}. Laurier\u2019s work is thus an attempt, as he puts it to tie everyday \ndescriptions and actions together, to see what people do with language in order to solve ordinary \nproblems and sustain daily life {Laurier, 2001 #809}. This work calls for an engagement with the \nfield, and epistemologically resists attempts to produce transcendent theory \u2013 that is it resists \nexplaining people\u2019s actions in academic language rather than their own \u2013 which is its strength and \nlimit depending upon your point of view. Similarly Rose talks of landscape as performative, with \n\u2018everyday agents calling the landscape into being as they make it relevant for their own lives, \nstrategies and projects\u2019 {Rose, 2002 #839, page 457} so the question becomes one of what is done \nnot what is represented, as proliferating operations and practices rather than a an operation of a \nhidden structure. For our purposes it points to a renewed attention to definition of a setting, actions \nwithin that setting and the identification of who is acting in as Laurier puts it \u2018an everyday \ngeographical problem solved everyday\u2019{Laurier, 2001 #809}. In this small scale attentiveness we \nsee something of a return to the classic legacy of street scale ethnographies, such as recently \nexemplified in work on street retailers such as book sellers {Duneier, 2001 #805} or African \nimmigrant traders {Stoller, 2002 #806}. The latter was introduced in Stoller\u2019s previous work along \nside a more explicit theorisation of the sensory and bodily performance of culture \u2013 by both \nethnographers and informants {Stoller, 1997 #807}. There is a humanist lineage to geographical \nattention to the senses but recent work has rather shaken up the notion of the centred individual.  \n \nGeographers have of late been including the \u2018body\u2019 in their research, but it would I think be fair to \nsay that these ideas have had a muted impact in terms of thinking through qualitative research. \nCertainly the bodily presence of the researcher is now acknowledged, so instead of the God-trick of \nthe invisible, omnipresent narrator we often have the researcher as a co-present interlocutor. \nThough if we are honest looking through papers published based on interviews the researher\u2019s \npresence becomes quite attenuated after setting the context of the field work quite often the \nresearcher forms a ghostly absence since as we rarely get questions included in quotes - for reasons \nwe may speculate upon of word limits, embarrassment at all our stumbling inadequacies or just to \nmake quotes short and accessible. The body quite often ends up as providing a sort of inescapable \npositioning of the researcher \u2013 through race, dis-ability or gender \u2013 but less often is the body the \ninstrument of research. We have moved beyond accepting \u2018the researcher as a detached head \u2013 the \nobject of Thought, Rationality and Reason \u2013 floating from research site to research site, thinking \nand speaking, while its profane counterpart, the Body, lurks unseen, unruly and uncontrollable in \nthe shadows of the Great Hall of the Academy\u2019 though it still may feel like \u2018The Body has become \nthe hysterical and embarrassing relative, \u201c shut in\u201d the academy\u2019s ivory tower\u2019 {Spry, 2001 #728, \npage 720}. That is we get glimpses of research as embodied work rather than just voices, as a \ncorporeal performance drawing upon our physical actions, as specific corpeoreal cultures of doing \ngeography in different ways in different places {Dewsbury, 2002 #813;Routledge, 2002 #418} \nincluding embodied, gendered experience of \u2018the field\u2019 in classes too {Nairn, 2002 #764}. \nHowever, there is rather less on the notions of haptic knowledge, of proprioception, that is of \nlearning through our bodies responses and situations. Recent controversy has surrounded \ngeographical appropriations of dance as a non-cognitive action that escapes the discursive, partly \nsince such an escape seems a contestible, and partly since we risk keeping intact the previous \ndivision of mind and body and merely inverting which is celebrated {Nash, 2000 #810, page 656}. \nHowever, it would seem that there indeed possibilities to learn about expanding field practice and \nwhat counts as valid knowledge \u2013 for instance, the bodily disciplines of dance, with different learnt \nresponses required for different genres {Picart, 2002 #727}may at least begin to put us in touch \nwith our own bodily hexis as a way of doing things. We may begin disrupting the disembodied \nvoices of academia and voiceless bodies colonised for knowledge {Spry, 2001 #728, page 718}. \nCertainly this is part of Parr\u2019s work \n \nHowever, I do not want to conflate performative ethnography with the performance of bodies in \nspecific places, nor is it simply a matter of adding in senses {Drobnick, 2002 #781}.  \n \n \n{Madge, 2002 #429} \n \nVisual \nLury 1998 3 freeze, frame and fix \u2018Retrodictive prophecy is thus identitifed as a key aspect of the \npower of the image in prosthetic culture\u2019 \nGrimshaw visceral and performative  in Rouch as oppose to intellectucal in  MacDougalls\u2019 works, \np100-1; Melisa Lewellyn-Davies, development of TV aesthetic \u2013 soap opera as social action and \nchange. \n{Sidaway, 2000 #7} \n{Sekula, 1995 #9} \n{Russell, 1999 #423} \n{Rose, 2000 #405} \n{Rogoff, 2000 #579} \n{Nicholson, 2002 #409} \n{Nicholson, 2001 #427} \n{Pink, 2001 #408} \n{Waitt, 2002 #406} \n{Young, 2001 #426} \n{Markwell, 2000 #410} \n{Lury, 1998 #780} \n{Lippard, 1999 #474} \n{Lomax, 1998 #717} \n \n \n \n{Smith, 2001 #385} \n{Smith, 2001 #8} \n{Reed, 2002 #770} \n{Pratt, 2001 #796} \n{McKay, 2002 #794} \n{Valentine, 2001 #387} \n \n \n{Powell, 2002 #833} \n"}
