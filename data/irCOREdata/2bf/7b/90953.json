We demonstrate that even a localized\nregion of twist scatters the propagating \u03c0 electrons and induces the opening of a (pseudo-)\ngap near the Fermi level. The subsequent conductance reduction may be compensated by an\napplied axial magnetic field, leading to a twist-induced, giant positive magneto-conductance in\nclean armchair nanotubes.\nCarbon nanotubes [1\u20133] exhibit a range of unusual electronic properties associated with\nthe morphology of these quasi-1D structures. Early one-electron theories successfully associ-\nated metallic or semi-conducting behaviour with the chiral vector that characterizes a given\nnanotube [4\u20136]. Further studies addressed the effect of atomic-level impurities [7\u201310] and inter-\ntube interactions [11\u201314] on electrical conductance, or magneto-transport [7,15\u201319]. In parallel\nwith the development of such one-electron theories, intensive studies of electron-electron cor-\nrelations have been undertaken. Indeed, nonlinear current-voltage (I-V ) characteristics have\nrecently been observed [20], which are reminiscent of Luttinger liquid behaviour. An intrigu-\ning question remains however, namely whether other effects may augment or even dominate\nsuch nonlinearities in the transport properties of nanotubes.\nIn this letter we predict that scattering of electrons from twistons may give rise to strongly\nnonlinear I-V characteristics. Twistons [21\u201323], associated with regions of axial twist in\notherwise perfect nanotubes, are intrinsic defects that are frozen into nanotube bundles dur-\ning their synthesis and hence cannot be ignored when discussing electron transport. Un-\nlike ideal straight and defect-free nanotubes, which have been shown to exhibit conventional\nmagneto-resistive behaviour [24], we find that nanotubes containing twistons may behave in\na very different way. In twisted tubes, we predict the occurrence of a giant positive magneto-\nconductance, an unexpected effect that by far exceeds the positive magneto-conductance as-\nsociated with weak localisation in disordered tubes [25].\n(\u2217) Present address: Covalent Materials, Inc. - 1295A 67th Street, Emeryville, CA 94608, USA.\nc\u00a9 EDP Sciences\n76 EUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n-3.0 -2.0 -1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0\neVbias  \u2212EF (eV)\n0.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n20.0\nG\n\/G\n0 d\u03b8\/dl=0.09\n0\n per unit cell\nd\u03b8\/dl=0.180 per unit cell\n(10,10) \nuniform twist\n \n  \n-3.0 -2.0 -1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0\neVbias  \u2212EF (eV)\n0.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n20.0\nG\n\/G\n0\nstraight\nlocalised twiston\n(10,10) \n0.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n0.0            10.0             20.0            30.0           40.0\nd\u03b8\/dl (deg\/nm)\n\u2206 \n(eV\n)\nmax\na)\nb) c)\nFig. 1 \u2013 Differential conductance G of an infinite (10, 10) carbon nanotube as a function of the applied\nbias voltage Vbias.

(c) Dependence of the conductance gap \u2206 on the\ninfinitely long twist d\u03b8\/dl for various (n, n) nanotubes.\nTo compute the effect of a finite scattering region on transport in an otherwise perfect\n(n, n) armchair nanotube, we use a parameterized four-state (s, px, py, pz) Hamiltonian, based\non a global fit to density functional results for graphite, diamond and C2 as a function of\nthe lattice parameter [26]. A finite twiston is treated as a scattering region connecting two\nsemi-infinite (n, n) nanotubes. A recursive Green\u2019s function formalism is used to evaluate the\ntransmission matrix t, describing the scattering of electrons of energy E from one end of the\nsemi-infinite nanotube to the other [27]. The differential electrical conductance at bias voltage\nVbias is related to scattering properties at energy E = EF \u2212 eVbias by the Landauer formula\nG = G0Tr\n{\nt\u2020t\n}\n, where G0 = 2e2\/h is the conductance quantum. A twiston is formed by\nintroducing a small angular distortion between neighbouring axial slices within the scattering\nregion. This is shown schematically in the inset of fig. 1(a), which displays the local shear\ndistortion within the unit cell of length L, containing two axial slices. The perturbation to\nthe Hamiltonian matrix enters through the scaling of the nearest-neighbour hopping integrals\nthat follow the changes in C-C bonds r1 and r2.\nFigure 1 shows the differential conductance for a straight and twisted (10, 10) nanotube.

(b) Differential conductance of (n, n)\nnanotubes at zero bias as a function of the local twist in finite twistons. In both figures, the twistons\n\u2206\u03b8 extend only across a finite segment of 100 unit cells in the axial direction.\nthe straight nanotube of fig. 1(a), the nondegenerate bands, which cross near EF, open up two\nconductance channels at this energy. Additional conduction channels follow as an increasing\nnumber of subbands appear near EF \u2212 eVbias at higher bias voltages. In the presence of a\nlocalized twiston, the differential conductance is suppressed at all energies, in particular near\nthe Fermi level. This is shown in fig. 1(a) for a finite-length twiston, with a total twist of 36\u25e6\nextending over 100 unit cells or \u2248 24.6 nm. The occurrence of a conductance gap near EF\nsuggests that electron scattering by a finite twiston can be viewed as a tunneling phenomenon.\nFor comparison with fig. 1(a), fig. 1(b) shows results for a nanotube subject to an infinitely\nlong uniform twist d\u03b8\/dl. This shows that that a localized or infinitely long twist opens up\na conductance gap \u2206 near EF. The predicted gap in the presence of infinitely long twists is\nshown in fig. 1(c) and agrees with results of refs. [21] and [22].\nIn the following, we discuss the dependence of the conductance gap on the twist distortion\nd\u03b8\/dl, the spatial extent of the twiston, and an axially applied magnetic field. As shown\nin fig. 1(c), we find that for a range of (n, n) tubes subject to an infinitely long twist, the\nmagnitude of the conductance gap \u2206 increases linearly with increasing twist distortion to\nits maximum value \u2206max, and decreases thereafter. For an (n, n) nanotube, we find the\nmaximum value of the conductance gap \u2206max to be achieved at an \u201coptimum tube twist\u201d\nvalue (d\u03b8\/dl)0 \u2248 An\u22122 (with A = 620\u25e6\/nm), which depends on the chiral index n. The\ndependence of \u2206max on the optimum tube twist (d\u03b8\/dl)0 corresponds to the envelope function\nin fig. 1(c), and is well approximated by \u2206max \u2248 \u2206(d\u03b8\/dl)0 \u2248 1.30 eV (1 \u2212 e\u22120.21(d\u03b8\/dl)0),\nwith (d\u03b8\/dl)0 in \u25e6\/nm units.\nDetails of conductance changes due to localized twistons, such as those of fig. 1(a), are\nshown for small bias voltages in fig. 2(a). In the present case, we subjected a straight (10, 10)\nnanotube to finite twists \u2206\u03b8 extending over 100 unit cells. We find that the conductance\npseudo-gap associated with finite twistons is accompanied by conductance oscillations at small\nbias voltages. A tube subject to an infinitely long twist, on the other hand, possesses a real\ngap with no such oscillations. The zero-bias conductance as a function of the twist angle for\nfinite twistons extending over 100 unit cells is presented in fig. 2(b) for a range of tube sizes.\nThis type of conductance behaviour is reminiscent of that associated with tunneling through\na potential barrier, where the twist-induced gap is analogous to the height of the barrier.\n78 EUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n-1.0 0 1.0\neVbias  \u2212 EF (eV)\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\nG\n\/G\n0\n\u03c6 = 0.0, \u2206\u03b8 = 36 0\n\u03c6 = 0.15\u03c60, \u2206\u03b8 = 00\n\u03c6 = 0.15\u03c60, \u2206\u03b8 = 360\n(8,8)\n\u2212\u03c0 0 \u03c0\nkL\n-3\n0\n3\neV\nbi\nas  \n\u2212\nE F\n \n(eV\n)\n\u03c6 = 0.15\u03c60 , \u2206\u03b8 = 360\n\u03c6 = 0, \u2206\u03b8 = 00\n(8,8)\na) b)\nFig. 3 \u2013 (a) Differential conductance of an (8, 8) carbon nanotube subject to a \u2206\u03b8 = 36\u25e6 twiston\nextending over 100 unit cells and\/or a magnetic flux \u03a6 = 0.15\u03a60 in the axial direction. Both the\ntwiston and the flux alone open up near-identical conductance gaps. A careful combination of nonzero\nflux and twist reopens a single conductance channel at small bias voltages. (b) Corresponding band\nstructure of an infinite (8, 8) carbon nanotube. Results for a straight tube in zero field are compared\nto those for a tube subject to an infinitely long uniform twist of d\u03b8\/dl = 0.36\u25e6 per unit cell and a\nmagnetic flux \u03a6 = 0.15\u03a60 in the axial direction.\nThese results, when combined, clearly demonstrate that finite twistons yield nonlinear I-V\ncharacteristics.\nIt must be stressed that the degree of twist required to open a pseudo-gap is small. For\nexample in the finite (10, 10) carbon nanotube of fig. 2(a), \u2206\u03b8 = 20\u25e6 over 100 unit cells\nis equivalent to d\u03b8\/dl \u0001 1\u25e6\/nm only. The resulting perturbation to the Hamiltonian is\ntherefore well within the limits of our model, where the twist is viewed as a frozen-in defect\nto the nanotube at low temperatures [23].\nIn a reasoning based on London theory, we now consider the effect of a uniform magnetic\nfield on transport in straight and twisted nanotubes. Axially applied magnetic fields produce\nan Aharonov-Bohm effect in carbon nanotubes [16,17,28], which in the clean limit arises from\nthe opening and closing of a band gap at the Fermi level. In the presence of a twiston, we\nnow demonstrate that the reverse effect can occur, namely that an axial magnetic field can\nremove the twiston-induced conductance gap, resulting in a positive magneto-conductance.\nThe effect of a combined structural twist and magnetic field on the conductance of nanotubes\nis discussed in fig. 3(a). These results show that a magnetic field may restore the zero-bias\nconductance of twisted armchair nanotubes from an essentially vanishing value to near half\nof the initial zero-twist value.\nTo understand this behaviour, we consider the roll-up process of a graphene sheet, spanned\nby the Bravais lattice vectors a1 and a2, to an armchair nanotube. Structural twist of the tube,\ndepicted in the inset of fig. 1(a), is related to a shear distortion of the initial graphene sheet.\nLet us assume that the electronic structure near EF can be attributed to the nearest-neighbour\npp\u03c0 interactions. The imposed structural twist is modeled by changing the relative strength of\nthe hopping integral \u03b3i along the neighbour vector ri with respect to the undistorted reference\nvalue \u03b30 = 1. Taking into account the diatomic basis of the distorted graphene sheet, we obtain\na half-filled band with particle-hole symmetry and an energy gap between the valence and\nconduction band of\n\u2206(k) = |1 + \u03b31eik\u00b7a1 + \u03b32eik\u00b7a2 | .\nS. W. D. Bailey et al.: Giant magneto-conductance etc. 79\nDuring the initial roll-up process to an (n, n) nanotube, the two-dimensional electron momen-\ntum space of the graphene sheet collapses into a one-dimensional space with k along the tube\naxis. Exposing the tube to a magnetic field adds the term eA\/\u0001 to k, where A is the vector\npotential, thus introducing a new phase factor [17]. Further noting that k \u00b7 ai = k \u00b7 ri, we\nfind that the energy gap between the highest valence and lowest conduction band of a twisted\ntube becomes\n\u2206(k) = |1 + \u03b31eik\u00b7r1ei\u03c6 + \u03b32eik\u00b7r2ei\u03c6| . (1)\nThe phase \u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03a6\/\u03a60 depends on the ratio between the magnetic flux \u03a6 trapped in the tube\nand the fundamental unit of flux \u03a60 = h\/e. Note that the fundamental unit of flux used in\nthis paper is twice the flux quantum, \u03a60 = h\/2e. The fundamental gap \u2206 = \u2206(k0), occurring\nat k0, is the minimum value found in the Brillouin zone. We also note that \u2206 = 0 for an\nundistorted tube in zero field.\nIn view of the twisted-tube morphology defined in fig. 1(a), it is convenient to introduce\nthe quantity \u03b1 = k\u00b7r1 = \u2212k\u00b7r2. From eq. (1) we find that \u2206(k) = 0 only if (sin\u03c6\/ sin\u03b1) =\n(\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b32) and (cos\u03c6\/ cos\u03b1) = (\u2212\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b32). Combining these equations, we find that the\nfundamental gap closes if\ncos 2\u03c6 =\n(\u03b321 + \u03b3\n2\n2)\u2212 (\u03b321 \u2212 \u03b322)2\n2\u03b31\u03b32\n(2)\nand\ncos 2\u03b1 =\n1\u2212 \u03b321 \u2212 \u03b322\n2\u03b31\u03b32\n. (3)\nIn other words, according to eq. (2), the twist-induced fundamental gap closes again, once the\n(n, n) nanotube is exposed to a magnetic field B\nB = Bc arccos\n(\n(\u03b321 + \u03b3\n2\n2)\u2212 (\u03b321 \u2212 \u03b322)2\n2\u03b31\u03b32\n)\n(4)\nalong its axis, where Bc = 2.28\u00d7104 T\/n2. According to eq. (3), the longitudinal wave vector\nk0, at which the fundamental gap vanishes, must satisfy the condition\nk0\u00b7r1 = 12 arccos\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b321 \u2212 \u03b322\n2\u03b31\u03b32\n)\n. (5)\nThe above heuristic model also demonstrates why the exact result of fig. 3(a) yields G\u2248G0\nfor the zero-bias conductance in the presence of a nonzero twist and flux, rather than the value\nG = 2G0 for a twist-free tube in zero field. In the latter case, the two open scattering channels\nat EF correspond to values of \u03b1 (or wave vector k) of opposite sign. For a given nonzero flux\n\u03a6 and a corresponding sign of the phase \u03c6, (sin\u03c6\/ sin\u03b1) = (\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b32) can be satisfied by only\none of these channels. This is shown in fig. 3(b), where the dispersion curves in the presence of\na compensating twist and flux are compared to those of a perfectly straight nanotube in zero\nfield. As expected, reversing the sign of the twist angle switches the allowed conduction chan-\nnel. Figure 3(b) also illustrates that the longitudinal Fermi wave vector k0, which marks the\nband crossing at EF, is shifted from the value for the unperturbed tube, as predicted by eq. (5).\nIn summary, we have analyzed for the first time the scattering properties of finite-size\ntwistons and shown that these introduce nonlinear I-V characteristics associated with the\nopening of a pseudo-gap at EF, thus effectively quenching the nanotube conductance. This\nconductance gap can be closed in an axial magnetic field, leading to a giant positive magneto-\nconductance. At small bias voltages, the conductance of a twisted tube in nonzero field can\nreach up to half the ballistic conductance value of a straight tube in zero field.\n80 EUROPHYSICS LETTERS\nREFERENCES\n[1] Iijima S., Nature, 354 (1991) 56.\n[2] Dresselhaus M.
