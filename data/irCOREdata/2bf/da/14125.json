The paper iden-\ntifies \u2018what works\u2019 in relation to discussion board use, demonstrating how students might gradually\ncreate an online community of their own, but only if prompted in a timely and appropriate way by\nthe course structure. It also identifies three distinct phases in online interaction and suggests these\nmight, to some extent, be mediated by assessment tasks.\nIntroduction\nInstruction using the Web as a vehicle for content dissemination, and instructor\u2013\nstudent interaction has increasingly dominated debates related to online learning\n(Nash, 2004). Much of the educational research in this area has focused on examin-\ning the importance of teacher\u2013student and student\u2013student interaction in the online\nlearning process, and in particular the use of discussion\/bulletin boards to foster the\ncreation of an effective learning environment (Downing & Chim, 2004a). While\nsome of this research has suggested effective ways of creating such an environment\n(Chou, 2001; Henri & Pudelko, 2003; Gilbert & Dabbagh, 2005), relatively few\nstudies (De Laat & Lally, 2004; Yukselturk & Top, 2006) have undertaken detailed\nweek-on-week analysis of tutor and student bulletin board activity throughout a\nsemester, and used these data to make recommendations about how an effective\nonline learning community can be established with appropriate use of the discussion\/\nbulletin board tools in Blackboard and Web CT.\n*Corresponding author.

Downing et al.\nOnline versus classroom-based levels of interaction\nThere is little doubt that the exponential growth in the use of the Internet and Web-\nbased instruction continues to present educators with considerable opportunities and\nchallenges (Boettcher, 1999; Downing, 2001; McNaught & Lam, 2005). Among the\nmost frequently cited challenges is concern over a perceived lack of interaction in\nonline educational environments (Hron & Friedrich, 2003), fuelled by the belief that\nour \u2018traditional\u2019 classrooms are somehow filled with the vital interactivity that online\nenvironments lack. For example, Robertson and Klotz (2002) suggest that the litera-\nture provides evidence that online courses are often configured and delivered in a\nstyle more often associated with independent study and that, while this format might\nwork in some instances, it leaves what they term a \u2018missing link\u2019 in student learning.\nThey assert that students in an online learning environment lack the opportunity to\nexperience the benefits of both structured dialogue and a sense of community that can\nbe created in a traditional on-site classroom environment. Others (Cook, 2000;\nSeabolt & Arends, 2000; Muirhead, 2001) support this view that the interactivity of\nthe traditional classroom is a vital, yet missing, part of Web-based instruction,\nsuggesting that online interaction is somehow flawed because it does not allow for the\nsocial and emotional interaction allegedly taking place in traditional classrooms.\nSome researchers (Downing & Chim, 2004b) have taken a slightly different viewpoint\nand investigated the relationship between personality type and different learning envi-\nronments, suggesting that classroom-based \u2018introverts\u2019 behave more like \u2018extraverts\u2019\nwhen involved in online discussion forums and are more active in online discussions\nthan when based in the classroom.\nSynchronous versus asynchronous discussion boards\nIn identifying the critical difference between synchronous (fixed time) and asynchro-\nnous (anytime, anywhere) discussions, Boaz et al. (1999) refer to the growth of online\n\u2018chat\u2019 as evidence of the potential value of synchronous online discussion activity.\nSynchronous methods are those that require students to participate in a learning\nevent at a specific time. However, one of the problems of synchronous discussion\nboards or chat rooms is that they do not always allow time for students to reflect and\nconsider what they want to say, and consequently those students who are more reflec-\ntive in their learning style can often feel left out. On the other hand, asynchronous\ndiscussion boards provide the opportunity for a less pressured learning environment\nwhere participants can contribute to debate at a pace that suits them, relatively free\nof the time constraints normally associated with face-to-face and synchronous learn-\ning environments (Downing & Chim, 2003). This is part of the added-value that can\nbe brought to the learning experience with appropriate use of an asynchronous\ndiscussion board tool. In characterising asynchronous learning environments as being\nable to provide anywhere\/anytime learning, Bourne et al. (1997) nonetheless identify\nwhat they regard as a wide variety of issues that remain to be resolved in relation to\nthe effective use of asynchronous discussion boards. These include the difficulties of\nCreating interaction in online learning 203\nencouraging early engagement, the creation of a sense of a learning community and\nthe sustainability of interaction. Those studies that address these areas either focus on\nways of reducing the potential social isolation of students through online exchange\n(Lally & Barrett, 1999), explore issues related to emergent role development and\ngroup awareness (De Laat & Lally, 2004) or concentrate on the establishment and\neffectiveness of forums for professional exchange and discussion amongst teachers\n(Selwyn, 2000).\nTherefore, despite the proliferation of debate, and with the possible exception of\nSalmon\u2019s (2000) work, there remains a relative lack of clear information on what\nworks in terms of setting up and sustaining a successful online learning environment\nusing the discussion\/bulletin board tool. This study begins to address this by analysis\nof discussion board activity and subsequent content data for one semester, and\nattempts to provide insights into the three issues raised by Bourne et al. (1997): \n\u25cf What works in terms of encouraging early engagement with the asynchronous use\nof the bulletin\/discussion board?\n\u25cf How does the sense of a learning community develop, and how can this be\nencouraged?\n\u25cf What works in terms of sustaining online interaction?\nMethods\nThe case-study design was chosen in order to explore student\u2013tutor and student\u2013\nstudent interaction in the creation of an effective online learning community using the\ndiscussion\/bulletin board tools available within the Blackboard\/WebCT Virtual\nLearning Environment. This is grounded in the work of Garrison and Anderson\n(2003), who identify three critical \u2018actors\u2019 in the formal educational context of an\nonline discussion board. These are students, teachers and content. However, atten-\ntion in this study is focused on student\u2013tutor and student\u2013student interaction, and\nthe content of that interaction is defined according to its agreed purpose (using inter-\nrater reliability\u2014three raters agreeing with each other about coding decisions). The\ncase study presented uses a detailed week-on-week analysis of tutor and student\ndiscussion board activity using Blackboard as the learning platform, from one\nblended learning course throughout a semester, to identify what works in establishing\nand maintaining an effective online learning community.\nThe blended learning \u2018case\u2019\nAccording to Valiathan (2002), \u2018blended learning\u2019 is used to describe learning that\nmixes various event-based activities, including face-to-face classrooms, online learn-\ning and self-paced learning. The main tool for accessing the online component of\nthe blended learning course was the learning management system, Blackboard.\nBlended learning seeks the optimum blend of self-study, teacher-led events and\ngroup collaboration, each deployed in a blend of asynchronous or synchronous\n204 K. J. Downing et al.\nmodes, appropriate for the leaning outcomes. The three-credit course selected for\nthis study is constructed of 10 units of learning material with students recom-\nmended to spend approximately 10 hours studying each unit. Teaching and learn-\ning materials are presented in a variety of formats and include video clips, audio\nclips, images, animations, URL links, PowerPoint presentations, and formative and\nsummative quizzes. A total of 7 hours and 40 minutes of face-to-face contact is\nprovided via five tutorials that take place in weeks 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 of a 13-week\nsemester. Each of tutorials one, two, three, and five are 1 hour and 20 minutes in\nduration, with tutorial four lasting 2 hours and 20 minutes to allow for students\nsummative small-group presentations. A discussion board is provided on the\nBlackboard learning platform for the online component of the course to allow\nstudents to engage in discussion and collaboration with fellow students and the\ncourse tutor. The objective here was to encourage participation in online discussion\nand foster the formation of a virtual learning community.\nGandell et al. (2000) describe the extent of Web use in terms of the impact it has on\nlearning relevance to the course. They categorised the extent of use according to the\nrelevance and importance of learning goals appropriately addressed. Consequently,\nthey identify five categories that represent a continuum of extent of use: \n\u25cf Minimal. Use of the Web that is neither relevant nor necessary to achieve any\nexplicitly stated course learning goals, and therefore has no impact on course-\nrelated learning.\n\u25cf Supplemental. Use of the Web that is relevant but not necessary to achieve a few\nexplicitly stated course goals, and therefore does not have much impact on related\nstudent learning.\n\u25cf Integral. Use of the Web that is relevant and contributes to achieving some of the\nlearning goals in the course, and would have a fair impact on student learning.\n\u25cf Central. Use of the Web that is relevant and necessary to achieve most learning\ngoals in the course, and would have a substantial impact on student learning.\n\u25cf Exclusive. Use of the Web that is relevant and necessary to achieve all learning goals\nin the course, and would have a major impact on student learning.\nThe extent of Web use for this blended learning course is clearly in the exclusive cate-\ngory, in which the use of the Web is both relevant and necessary, and would have a\nmajor impact on student learning. The extent of Web use is exclusive (Gandell et al.,\n2000) because the online materials (units) are both relevant and necessary to achieve\nall the learning and assessment outcomes.\nParticipants\nAll participants were first-year City University of Hong Kong freshmen on the\napplied psychology associate degree programme. Students were enrolled in a\nblended learning applied psychology course, \u2018Practical Psychology for Everyday\nLife\u2019, which was run during Semester A of 2006 (September\u2013December 2006) and\nvolunteered retrospectively (they were approached after the semester was completed)\nCreating interaction in online learning 205\nto participate in this study. All students enrolled on this course (n = 32) agreed to\ntake part in the study. All participants were of similar academic background,\nevidenced by their successful application to study applied psychology at associate\ndegree level at City University of Hong Kong. Ten participants were selected as a\nconvenience sample and interviewed in week 17 by a research assistant not involved\nin teaching the course.\nThe only tutor for this course was the first author of this paper, a chartered psychol-\nogist and teacher with some 25 years\u2019 experience as an educator.\nProcedure\nThe focus of this case study was the discussion board activity and the analysis of what\nworks in terms of encouraging and sustaining discussion board use, and developing a\nsense of an online learning community. Data related to asynchronous discussion\nboard activity from both tutor and students were captured and retained by a research\nassistant over a 17-week period, which began when the course was released online\none week before the start of the study period, and extended three weeks beyond the\n13 weeks of the course duration. This was later analysed on a week-by-week basis to\nhighlight student discussion board activity, and to relate this to tutor discussion board\nactivity, and other prompts built into the asynchronous course materials. The content\nmaterials and all assessment tasks for the whole course (10 units) were available from\nthe first day of the semester so that students could learn at a pace with which they\nwere comfortable. Of particular interest were the categories of student\u2013student inter-\naction and student\u2013tutor interaction over the timescale identified above. Using these\ncategories, data were analysed according to four broad emergent themes: \n\u25cf Student\u2013student interaction for instrumental reasons. This category includes all post-\nings that primarily relate to seeking and giving assistance, with either academic\nquestions related to course materials and content or enquiries about assignments\nand the structure of the course.\n\u25cf Student\u2013tutor interaction for instrumental reasons. This category includes all postings\nthat primarily relate to seeking and giving assistance, with either academic ques-\ntions related to course materials and content or enquiries about assignments and\nstructure of the course.\n\u25cf Student\u2013student interaction for emotional\/social reasons. This category includes all\npostings that primarily relate to seeking and giving reassurance and assistance, with\nsocial or emotional questions\/issues related to studying the course.\n\u25cf Student\u2013tutor interaction for emotional\/social reasons. This category includes all post-\nings that primarily relate to seeking and giving reassurance and assistance, with\nsocial or emotional questions\/issues related to studying the course.\nThese themes emerged as a result of identifying that the interactions on our discus-\nsion boards generally fell into two clear categories and could usefully be classified\naccordingly. Postings were either primarily instrumental or social\/emotional in terms\nof their purpose (we agreed that more than 95% of the posting content had to fall\n206 K. J. Downing et al.\nwithin the category descriptions above). This classification was surprisingly easy to\nachieve with no disagreements among the three independent raters, or subsequent\nblind rating by the author. Interestingly, but beyond the scope of this paper to\nconsider further, these categories also appear in research into coping strategies\nconducted by Carver et al. (1989).\nResults\nData were analysed over the 17-week period as identified in Figure 1, which shows a\nline graph of student and tutor discussion board activity. The course begins in week\none and ends in week 13, and the overall number of postings can be seen in the table\nunderneath the graph. While the total for each individual week is summed, a line\ngraph is useful here to demonstrate the overall flow of discussion board postings and\nhighlights three emergent phases (weeks 0\u20133, weeks 4\u20139, and weeks 10\u201316) marked\nwith the dotted vertical lines.\nFigure 1. Overall distribution of discussion board postings from week 0 to week 16Data were then analysed cumulatively for the full 17-week period according to the\ncoding categories identified for this case study. In other words, a matrix summarising\nstudent\u2013student and student\u2013tutor interaction for instrumental and social reasons\nwas drawn up as presented in Table 1 following independent rating and categorising\nby three raters.\nDistribution\u00a0of\u00a0Discussion\u00a0Board\u00a0Messages\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\n175\n200\n225\nT\nu\nto\nr\u00a0\na\nn\nd\n\u00a0S\ntu\nd\ne\nn\nts\n'\u00a0P\no\ns\nti\nn\ng\nTutor Students\nTutor 6 48 93 46 43 51 16 57 25 38 30 34 31 17 5 9 2\nStudents 5 131 198 154 66 87 70 88 95 61 45 62 60 40 37 4 2\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nPhase\u00a0I\u00a0 Phase\u00a0II Phase\u00a0III\u00a0\nFigure 1.

What is immediately evident is the degree of\nparallelism between the two lines, with a notable exception around week eight that\nwill be discussed later. This might be explained by the type and timing of the assess-\nment tasks for this course. Assessment was divided into three components. The first\ncomponent was participation, which spanned the whole 13-week duration of the\ncourse and was worth 20% of the total marks: 10% was awarded for in-class partici-\npation assessed over the five tutorials and 10% for online discussion board participa-\ntion. Students were also required to make a short presentation on a topic in the\ntutorial for week nine (40%) and to submit a 2000-word written paper (40%) by week\n15. The next most notable feature of the data in Figure 1 is the emergence of three\ndistinct phases in terms of posting activity, also identified in Tables 1 and 2 and the\nsummary graph in Figure 2, which appear to be largely driven by the timing and\nTable 1.

Summary of student\u2013student and student\u2013tutor postings for instrumental and social reasons over the three identified phases (weeks 0\u201316)\nPhase one: weeks zero to three (socially formative phase)\nThe tutor adopted a nurturing and supportive role during the first three weeks of the\ncourse, which can be operationally defined as becoming heavily engaged (in terms of\nproviding an encouraging and non-critical response) with students via the online\ndiscussion board and ensuring that most tutor postings contained encouraging and\nsupportive comment. This was intended to create a culture of high trust as an appro-\npriate \u2018climate for learning\u2019 (Biggs, 1999). This is evidenced in the tutor postings data\nin Tables 1 and 2. The intention, then, is for the tutor to gradually withdraw, increas-\ningly responding by acknowledging good questions and reflecting these back to the\nonline student group to encourage metacognitive activity (Downing & Shin, 2006),\nfurther independent discussion and peer learning activity over the remaining\n10 weeks of the course. A formative assessment task, due in week three, was designed\nwhereby each student contacted a fellow and posted a short introduction to that indi-\nvidual on the discussion board. The intention of this formative social assignment was\nto encourage early engagement with the asynchronous use of the discussion board,\nand to attempt to initiate the beginnings of a sense of a supportive online learning\ncommunity. The number and nature of student postings during the first three weeks\nFigure 2. Summary of student\u2013student and student\u2013tutor postings for instrumental and social \nreasons over the three identified phases (weeks 0\u201316)\nCreating interaction in online learning 209\nof the course demonstrates that this was an effective way of encouraging early engage-\nment with both the discussion board environment and each other. In fact, many of\nthe students, who had been in online contact during this exercise, subsequently chose\nto sit together from tutorial three until the end of the course. Phase one is character-\nised by interaction that is largely social in nature, with student\u2013student interaction for\nsocial reasons accounting for significantly more postings than the other three catego-\nries. The next highest categories are student\u2013tutor interaction for social reasons\nfollowed by student\u2013tutor interaction for instrumental reasons. Analysis of the\ncontent of the latter category shows most postings to be related to practical course\narrangements, tutorials and assignments. The final category was student\u2013student\ninteraction for instrumental reasons, suggesting perhaps that students have not yet\nsufficiently developed the social relationships with their peers necessary for collabo-\nrative learning. A review of student feedback for this semester confirms this assertion,\nwith most student comments identifying the need to build some sort of relationships\nbetween each other and the tutor at this early stage. Almost all students identified the\nearly online exercise of contacting and introducing a fellow as very effective in terms\nof creating a sense of belonging to a group, and only one student commented that he\nfound it \u2018annoying\u2019. This finding confirms that of Brown (2001), who identifies the\nfirst stage of her three-stage model as being about making friends online with whom\nstudents felt comfortable communicating. This is very similar to what happens in\ntraditional classrooms where the creation of a safe and supportive learning environ-\nment provides an effective context for subsequent learning activity. The social role of\nthe tutor is more clearly defined at this stage than the relationships between students,\nand this accounts for the significantly higher levels of student\u2013tutor interaction in the\nsocial category during this socially formative and somewhat exploratory stage. By\nweek three, all students said that they felt more comfortable in the online discussion\nboard environment; this is confirmed by a notable rise in giving support to their\ncolleagues for instrumental reasons. This is perhaps a form of social learning through\nmodelling the tutors\u2019 online social\/emotional support behaviours in the manner\ndescribed by Bandura (1965), and it certainly set the scene for a warm and supportive\nlearning environment both online and in the tutorials. In fact, the importance of\ndeveloping a sense of trust in the learning environment (McGregor, 1967; Biggs,\n1999) is identified as being an even more critical success factor in online learning and\nworking environments by Grundy (2002).\nThe socially formative assessment task to be posted on the discussion board by\nweek three undoubtedly contributed to student\u2013student social interaction during this\nphase, and substantially assisted in the early stages of relationship building\u2014almost\ncertainly leading to more student\u2013student instrumental interaction in phase two, and\nsetting the scene for a generally high level of overall discussion board activity.\nPhase two: weeks four to nine (socially instrumental phase)\nBrown (2001) identifies the second stage as one of community conferment or accep-\ntance, occurring when students are part of a long, thoughtful, threaded discussion on\n210 K. J. Downing et al.\na subject of importance. The interactions between weeks four and nine inclusive\ndemonstrate an increase in student\u2013student interaction for instrumental reasons, but\nthis remains the lowest category overall. However, contrary to phase one where social\ninteractions were paramount, this period shows a well balanced mix of both social\nand instrumental interaction (see Table 2, weeks four to nine). The increase in the\nstudent\u2013tutor interaction for instrumental reasons is assignment driven again, this\ntime by the requirement to produce a group summative assignment in the form of a\npresentation on a selected topic in week nine. Surprisingly, in individual follow-up\ninterviews with 10 of the student participants, seven stated that they began to feel a\nsense of competition with other groups during this phase and therefore felt more\n\u2018comfortable\u2019 asking the tutor for help with instrumental matters than their peers\/\ncompetitors. All 10 interviewees said that they used private email, rather than the\ndiscussion board, to communicate with their fellow presentation group members\nduring this phase. Most gave the reason that they did not want to give away any\n\u2018secrets\u2019 about their presentation to the other groups. They also admitted being\n\u2018careful\u2019 about how they phrased discussion board requests to the tutor for instru-\nmental help during this phase so as not to give their \u2018presentation plans to other\ngroups\u2019, and frustrated that the tutor refused to answer queries via email. The tutor\nrefused to answer individual email queries, except of a private\/personal nature\nthroughout the course, on the basis that this might encourage more sharing and\ncollaborative learning online. The gradual reduction in student\u2013student interaction\nfor instrumental reasons (see Figure 1) between weeks four and nine is largely a\nresult of students experiencing a sense of inter-group competition given that the\npresentation assignment due in week nine was summative in nature and carried a\nsubstantial proportion (40%) of the overall marks for the course. While the overall\nnumber of postings during this period is up very slightly on phase one, the distribu-\ntion of postings according to the four categories is very different and suggests that\nBrown\u2019s (2001) second stage of community conferment or acceptance is compro-\nmised when students perceive they are in competition. In fact, the highest number of\npostings during this phase was student\u2013tutor interaction for instrumental reasons\n(see Figure 2), which is more consistent with Yuselturk and Top\u2019s (2006) \u2018task-\noriented area\u2019 classification where instrumental questions take priority over social\ninteraction. Nonetheless, social interaction remained very slightly above instrumen-\ntal interaction overall, providing evidence that some sense of community prevailed\nduring this phase.\nPhase three: weeks 10\u201316 (withdrawal phase)\nIn this phase, both student\u2013student and student\u2013tutor interaction begins to drop\naway considerably, but a well-balanced mix of social and instrumental postings is\nmaintained. The overall number of postings during this phase is 378, compared with\n697 in phase two, demonstrating that some level of disengagement from the discus-\nsion board is taking place. At this stage of the course, students should have completed\nmost of the online course material and be preparing for their individual summative\nCreating interaction in online learning 211\nwritten assignment (40%) due in week 15. All 10 students in the individual follow-up\ninterviews reported that they \u2018considerably reduced\u2019 the frequency of logging on to\nthe online course at this stage, citing final assignment production pressure. This\ngeneral disengagement with the online learning materials clearly led to a general\nreduction in discussion board use because students were less likely to be logging into\nthe course to study course materials. This assertion was borne out by course login\nstatistics, which also showed a steady downward trend after week 10 that largely\nparalleled the reduction in discussion board activity. The follow-up interviews also\nrevealed that once again many students (8 out of the 10 interviewed) felt a keen sense\nof competition with their peers (this time on an individual basis) and preferred to just\nconcentrate on their final written assignment, believing that this would bring them\nmore benefits than continuing to engage in the online discussion board. However,\nstudent\u2013tutor interaction remains at phase one levels, with students reporting that\nmaintaining tutor contact to the bitter end was very important and \u2018might influence\ntheir grade positively\u2019. When asked at the interview about this, most students said\nthey were grateful to the tutor for support during the course, and still had some ques-\ntions to ask in relation to the final assignment, so that is why they had more contact\nwith the tutor than their peers at this stage of the course. However, when pressed, four\nof the students admitted they thought it \u2018might influence their final assignment\ngrade\u2019. All but one student said they felt a sense of friendship or community with their\nfellow students but that this was tempered by the need to get a good individual grade\nin their final assignment. All 10 of the interviewed students said they would attempt\nto keep in social contact with at least one of their peers after the course was complete,\nwhich suggests some adherence to Brown\u2019s (2001) third stage of camaraderie, but\none that is much more complex and multi-dimensional than she suggests.\nConclusion\nSome insights have been gained from this case study into the questions posed by\nBourne et al. (1997) in terms of what works in facilitating an online discussion board,\nand some further questions are raised about the complexity of discussion board inter-\naction over the duration of a semester-long course.\nQuestion 1 asked what works in terms of encouraging early engagement with the\nasynchronous use of the discussion board. There is little doubt from the level of\nonline activity and interaction identified in Figure 1 and Table 1 above that early\nengagement with an asynchronous discussion board can be greatly facilitated by the\ndesign of a simple yet appropriate socially formative assignment. By asking students\nto contact each other and introduce a fellow student using the discussion board\nmedium, a great deal of early interaction was facilitated. In phase one, there were a\ntotal of 681 postings from 32 students (Table 2, weeks zero to three) and these\nincluded both student\u2013student and student\u2013tutor interaction, with the emphasis\n(almost twice as many) being in terms of social interaction. In that sense, and in terms\nof Brown\u2019s (2001) first stage of \u2018making friends online with whom students felt\ncomfortable communicating\u2019, this approach is successful. However, the established\n212 K. J. Downing et al.\nrole of the tutor is clearly important in facilitating a supportive learning environment\nin the early weeks of establishing an online sense of community.\nQuestion two asked how the sense of a learning community develops, and how this\ncan be encouraged. This is the most problematic question to be answered because,\nwhile it might be possible to classify postings as primarily social or instrumental in\nnature, students will also take into account many other factors before deciding when\nand what to post. This is evidenced by the data in phase two; and the comments from\nstudents in the follow-up interviews, which demonstrate that students are often influ-\nenced by what they perceive, are pragmatic considerations about the competition they\nare involved in when required to complete summative assignments. Despite the fact\nthat the tutor for this course made it very clear from the outset that assessment was\ncriterion referenced, rather than norm-referenced, and that it was therefore possible\nfor every student to be graded \u2018A\u2019, there was nonetheless a clear formation of separate\npresentation working groups, and a subsequent reluctance to share too much online\nwith non-group members. In retrospect, this would have been an appropriate time to\ncreate separate working groups within the discussion board, rather than to continue\nwith one group to which all students had access. This would have positively influ-\nenced the continuation of a sense of a supportive learning community established in\nphase one. This finding is broadly in agreement with that of Nicol et al. (2003), who\npoint out that the social context of online learning is qualitatively different from more\ntraditional modes and that both practitioners and researchers need to recognise this\ncomplexity. In this case study, the timing and handling of the group summative\nassessment task clearly interfered with the continued establishment of a sense of a\nsupportive and nurturing online learning community, and that if we are to take full\nadvantage of the power of online technologies, we must develop our understanding\nof their impact upon the social context for online learning.\nQuestion three asked what works in terms of sustaining online interaction, and this\nis a question that requires some analysis. The results from this study, and others\n(Brown, 2001; Hwang & Wang, 2004; Yuselturk & Top, 2006) suggest that online\ndiscussion activity might go through a series of stages or phases, which on the surface\nmight not be too dissimilar to what happens in classroom-based learning. In other\nwords, there is a socially active phase, an instrumental phase and then a gradual, and\nperhaps natural, process of disengagement. The current study demonstrates that\nstudents take a pragmatic approach to this process, disengaging when they feel they\nhave all the information they need to complete the summative assessment tasks they\nare set. To that extent it is not effective or worthwhile to attempt to sustain online\ninteraction for the duration of the whole course. Provided students have engaged in\nreflective online discussion activity early on, and completed the online course mate-\nrials, it might be counter-productive to try to sustain involvement through to the end\nof the course.\nWe should interpret sustaining online interaction in a way that adds the provision\n\u2018as far as there is educational value in so doing\u2019. If the question is interpreted in this\nway, educators are provided with much more scope in terms of how they decide to\nuse, and how they evaluate, the success or failure of online discussion forums.\nCreating interaction in online learning 213\nVygotsky (1978) pointed out that conceptual learning was a collaborative effort\nthat required supportive dialogue, so it is reasonable to assume that online discussion\nhas the potential to enhance both collaboration and concept development. However,\nsome researchers take the view that true social interaction leading to cognitive growth\nin an online context is rare (Son, 2002; Meyer, 2003; Wickstrom, 2003), whereas\nothers (Poole, 2000; Grady, 2003; Schallert et al., 2003) demonstrate that significant\nsocial interaction leading to effective knowledge construction does take place in\nonline discussion forums. As Kay (2006) points out, a resolution to this debate lies in\nboth the user acceptance of the medium and the amount of structure used to guide\nthe online discussion board. The current study suggests that the former task is\nperhaps more easily achieved than the latter, and that more research is needed into\n\u2018what works\u2019 in terms of engaging and sustaining online learning communities that\nare truly collaborative and supportive.\nReferences\nBandura, A.
