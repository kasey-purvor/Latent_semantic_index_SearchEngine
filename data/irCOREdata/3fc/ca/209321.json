Introduction \nChoice has been the big policy idea in education for quite some time, and it is an \nidea that is increasingly being pushed hard in the UK. Choice may be a good thing \nin itself because people value their freedom to choose. Yet, most proponents stress \nthat it leads educational providers to compete for pupils by improving their \ntechnology, thus raising educational standards. Additionally, it is argued that gains \nmay directly arise from choice through better matching of pupils with schools \naccording to personal tastes and needs. These issues have been widely researched \nin the US, with an extensive literature in the education and economics of education \nfields (Hoxby, 2000, 2003, 2004). However, it seems only fair to say that the \nexisting evidence is mixed, and at best offers a shaky foundation for policy. \nDespite this, a quasi-market in education has political currency.1 In this paper \nwe study school choice and competition, with the aim of uncovering empirical \nevidence for the hypothesised performance advantages that advocates of choice and \ncompetition say underpin these policy ideas. We focus explicitly on two \nconceptually distinct questions: 1) Do pupils perform better if they have more \nschools from which to choose, conditional on where they live; 2) Do pupils \nperform better if they are enrolled in schools that have to compete with many other \n                                                 \n1 See Le Grand (1991, 1993) and the more recent discussion in Machin and Vignoles (2005). In the \nrecent 2005 UK government election, the two leading parties both supported it in their manifestos. \nLabour\u2019s pledged was that \u201cgood schools will be able to expand their size and also their influence \u2013 \nby taking over less successful schools\u201d (Labour Party, 2005a). The Conservatives pledged a right to \nchoose that \u201cwill give real autonomy to all schools, and real choice to parents\u201d, with the claim that \n\u201cchoice drives up standards in every field of human endeavour [and]\u2026 put[s] pressure on \nunderperforming schools to raise their standards\u201d (Conservative Party, 2005). \n \n- 3 - \nschools to attract pupils, given where pupils live? We consider these questions to \nbe the most relevant when evaluating the likely impacts of policies designed to \nexpand the choice set available to families, without requiring them to move house. \nAs such, we abstract from the kind of choice that can by exercised by changes in \nresidential location (Tiebout, 1956), which has been studied elsewhere (e.g. Hoxby, \n2000).  \nOur analysis, which use rich administrative data on Primary school pupils in \nthe South East of England, allows us to improve on the existing (largely US-based) \nliterature, since the data contains detailed information on pupil and school \naddresses, which we will use to construct separate choice and competition indices. \nWe also make use of the fact that only a small percentage of pupils in England \nattend Primary schools outside of their home Local Education Authority (LEA) \nbecause there are institutional barriers to doing so. This allows us to derive credible \ninstrumental variables for the competition and choice indices, based on the \nboundary discontinuity that these barriers generate. We use this empirical strategy \nto solve the difficult issues of endogeneity that are inextricably associated with \nstudying connections between pupil performance and choice\/competition. \nIn the empirical analysis, simple least squares regressions show no link \nbetween choice and achievement, but a small positive association between school \ncompetition and performance. However, this seems to be related to endogenous \npupil sorting or school location, since instrumental variable estimates show that \nthere are no general benefits to be had from increasing school competition. It is \nonly a minority of schools, namely Voluntary Aided schools with autonomous \ngovernance and admission procedures, which seem to respond positively to a \ngreater degree of competition with local schools.  \nThe rest of the paper has the following structure. The next section outlines the \nideas surrounding debates on choice and competition and provides a short guide to \n- 4 - \nthe (vast) empirical evidence from the US and the (scant) empirical evidence from \nthe UK. Then, we discuss how choice and competition relate to the current \nadmissions system in England. Following that, in Section 4 we explain our \nempirical methods. Section 5 describes the data and Section 6 presents our results. \nSection 7 concludes. \n2. Theoretical Background and Previous Research  \nTheoretical discussions of the benefits of school choice and competition, and on its \nless desirable consequences, are wide ranging and often highly politicised. \nAlthough broad philosophical issues are often involved (Brighouse, 2000), here we \nwill mainly attend to the narrower claims about the potential productivity and \nperformance benefits that have been the prime focus of applied work in the field. \nThe arguments are fairly well rehearsed, and there are many theoretical expositions \nthat focus on different aspects of the issue2, so the purpose of this section is to \nbriefly outline the key themes that motivate and structure our empirical work. \nBehind any analysis in this field lie two ideal modes of school provision: (1) \nthe community-school model, in which only pupils living nearby the school are \nallowed in; and (2) the parental-choice model, in which schools admit pupils \nregardless of where they live, and parental preference is the deciding factor. \nBroadly speaking, mode (1) has traditionally been the most dominant form of state \nprovision in most parts of the world. However, comparison of the relatively weak \nperformance of state-sector schools operating under mode (1), with respect to \nschools in the private sector which operate largely on mode (2), has led many \n(following on from Friedman, 1962) to advocate expansion of choice as the road to \n                                                 \n2 See, inter alia, Epple and Romano (1998), Epple, Newlon and Romano (2002), McMillan (2004) \nand Nechyba (2000, 2003). \n- 5 - \nbetter schooling. Alternative systems have begun to be adopted worldwide (Plank \nand Sykes, 2003).  \nAdvocates of mode (2) tend to base their claims on two standard efficiency \narguments from economic theory. According to the first argument, community-\nbased schools serving single neighbourhoods are monopolistic, and the incentives \nfor improvement or adoption of new teaching technologies may be weak. These \nincentives need to come from good governance, supported by strong institutional \narrangements including training, monitoring, mechanisms for self-evaluation and \nperformance-related pay. The alternative is to give parents freedom of choice, to \nlink school finance, management incentives and teacher pay to school popularity, \nand so create a market incentive mechanism. Under this system, schools must adapt \nto meet parental demands \u2013 presumably to include high educational standards \u2013 or \nfail and close. We refer to this mechanism as a school competition effect stemming \nfrom greater parental choice in education markets. The second economic argument \nis that gains arise through the reallocation of pupils to schools according to \npersonal tastes and pedagogic needs. Consider a move from a community-based to \nchoice-based system: if every pupil can find a school that that they enjoy at least as \nmuch as the school that was available under the old system, the new system must \nbe welfare improving. Additionally, if every pupil can find a school that offers a \nteaching technology that educates them at least as effectively as under the \ncommunity-based system, then academic achievement should improve. We refer to \nthis second mechanism as a direct choice effect of school provision operating \nunder mode (2). \nIn defence of mode (1) it has been claimed that teaching works better in a \nstable environment, where teachers are not under undue competitive pressures and \nwhere there is lower search-based turnover (which may have detrimental effects on \nachievement; Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin, 2004; Gibbons and Telhaj, 2007a). \n- 6 - \nMoreover, schools could respond to an increase in competition by reducing costly \neffort and going down-market in order to serve only those with weak preferences \nfor school performance (McMillan, 2004). Another overarching concern is that \neven if wider school choice boosts some pupils\u2019 achievements, these benefits may \ncome at the cost of increased between-school segregation and the gains may not be \nequally distributed.3 In this case, it would be important to know whether the gains \nto the \u201cwinners\u201d outweigh the costs to those who lose out (i.e. whether school \ncompetition is a \u201ctide to lift all boats\u201d; Hoxby (2003)). Finally, total pupil travel \ndistances could be greater when pupils do not automatically attend their closest \nneighbourhood school, with consequent environmental impacts and detrimental \neffects on achievement because of lateness, absence or stress.  \nGiven all these counterbalancing arguments, solid empirical evidence on the \neffects of school choice and competition is needed in order to make informed \npolicy decisions. In fact, a substantial volume of quantitative evidence has been \nproduced over the past decades \u2013 using various approaches \u2013 particularly in the US \ncontext. The first and most common empirical framework uses cross-sectional, \ngeographically-based school choice\/competition indices to explore the effects of \nimplicit variation in the level of choice available in different school markets (e.g. \nBelfield and Levin, 2003 for a survey, and Hoxby, 2000, and Rothstein, 2006a for \nrecent examples). Our empirical work adopts this style of approach. One \nfundamental empirical problem here is the definition of the choice\/competition \nindicator. The general idea is to first define a market area, and then measure the \nnumber of choices available within it. However, this depends entirely on prior \nassumptions about the markets and the appropriate units of choice: for example, \n                                                 \n3 Although the theoretical argument for the link between choice, competition and segregation is not \nclear, and could point in either direction.  \n- 7 - \nsome studies look at the number of schools within a school district, whilst others \nlook at the number of school districts within a metropolitan area. Another difficulty \nis that the choice\/competition indices are potentially correlated with unobserved \npupil, family or area characteristics. Hoxby (2000) provides one of the best known \nsolutions to this problem, observing that pupils perform better in US metropolitan \nareas that are naturally subdivided (by rivers) into a greater number of school \nadmission districts (thus offering a wider variety of schools).4 Generally, studies \nadopting this competition index-based approach come to varying conclusions, and \nBelfield and Levin\u2019s (2003) summary is that \u201cthe gains from competition are \nmodest in scope with respect to realistic changes in levels of competition\u201d, with \nmany results statistically insignificant. Importantly, none of these studies separates \nthe influence of parental or pupil choice from the effect of inter-school \ncompetition, although these are quite distinct concepts. In the empirical work we \npresent below, we try to address all these issues: the appropriate definition and \nendogeneity of the choice-competition index in educational achievement models, \nand the distinction between choice and competition.  \nOther methodological approaches appear in the literature, but all have their \ndrawbacks. Some studies evaluate the benefits of institutional systems that widen \naccess to private schooling through voucher systems (Rouse, 1998; Mizala and \nRomaguera, 2005). Although these studies might say something about the benefits \nthat the private sector offers over schooling in the state sector, they say very little \nabout the expansion of choice or competition in its own right. One extension is to \n                                                 \n4 Note that Hoxby\u2019s paper is concerned with choice across school districts, exercised by Tiebout \nresidential moves, not with choice conditional on place of residence. Recently, the validity of the \nstream-based instruments and the robustness of Hoxby\u2019s results have been contested (Rothstein, \n2006b; Hoxby, 2006). \n- 8 - \nmeasure the effects of private school enrolment on local state school performance \n(Hoxby, 1994, 2004), but this strategy is complicated by the possibility that the \nlocation of private schools is endogenous to neighbourhood status, and such \nschools are likely to skim off higher-achieving pupils from the state sector (Epple \nand Romano, 1998). Other studies evaluate the impact of policy changes that \nintroduce greater choice into geographically localised educational markets, in some \ncases using research designs that exploit random assignment to choice \nprogrammes. Again, some researchers find positive benefits (Holmes et al., 2003; \nHoxby, 2003; Hoxby and Rockoff, 2004; Lavy, 2005), whilst others do not (Cullen \net al. 2003, 2005). All these findings are difficult to generalize, given the highly \nlocalised and peculiar settings under analysis. Moreover, it is difficult to judge \nwhether any benefits occur because choice improves the match of pupils with \neducational providers or because it increases competitive pressure. \nAll in all, it has to be said that the international evidence is voluminous, but \nmixed in its findings. In contrast, evidence specifically for Britain is almost non-\nexistent. A few studies show evidence of positive links between competition and \nperformance, popularity or efficiency (Levacic 2004; Bradley et al. 2000, 2001). \nOn the other hand, Clark (2005) reports that reforms that handed more power to \nschools (in the late 1980s) only generated modest efficiency gains through \ncompetition effects. Otherwise, all the research effort in Britain has been directed \nat the effects of competition on segregation (e.g. Goldstein and Noden, 2003; \nGorard, Taylor and Fitz, 2003; Burgess et al., 2004; Gibbons and Telhaj 2007b), \nwhich we do not pursue here.  \nThe empirical work we present in this paper is, therefore, the first pupil-level \nanalysis of the effects of choice and competition on academic achievement in \n- 9 - \nPrimary schools in England, and the first distinguishing these two concepts \nempirically.5 Moreover, our analysis is based on a large pupil census for a sizable \npart of the South of England, which is thus generally representative. Finally, \nexploiting some institutional features of school admissions across school district \nboundaries, we devise a solid instrumental variable (IV) strategy, which we \ndescribe in more detail below.  \n3. School Choice and Competition in English Primary Schools \nThe current state-school system in England is something of a hybrid of a \ncommunity-based model and a parental-choice setting (i.e., models (1) and (2) \ndiscussed above). Traditionally neighbourhood-based, the principle of choice has \nbeen extended to a greater or lesser extent in different areas since the Education \nReform Act of 1988 (see e.g. Glennerster, 1991). The trend has continued recently, \nwith further expansion of choice being advocated in many quarters.6 \nAlthough choice at the Secondary education phase tends to dominate the \npolitical rhetoric and policy discussion, in this paper we will consider the effects of \nchoice and competition among Primary state schools only.7 The reasons for this are \ntwo-fold. First, we believe that choices made at Primary age are critical for later \neducational success (see Heckman, 2000, and Dearden et al., 2004), and that \nparents are very active in exercising choice at the Primary level (as evidenced by \n                                                 \n5 Bayer and McMillan (2005) is the only other work conceptually distinguishing the two ideas. Yet \nthe authors\u2019 structural modelling approach only allows estimating the effect of school competition. \n6 See, for example the UK Government\u2019s October 2005 White Paper: \u201cHigher Standards, Better \nSchools for All: More choice for parents and pupils\u201d. \n7 The UK Labour party, for example, has proposals to make all Secondary schools Specialist schools \nwith their own curriculum specialisations and to allow popular schools to expand in response to \ndemand (Labour Party 2005b). \n- 10 - \nresearch on the house price effects of Primary school performance in Gibbons and \nMachin, 2003, 2006). Secondly, travel distances have a greater role to play in \nPrimary school choice because children of this age are not independent travellers. \nThis means that geographical criteria are likely to be more relevant in deciding \nwhich school to attend, so that the availability of schools can be more confidently \ninferred from geographical measures of accessibility. \nAll state schools in England are funded largely by central government, \nthrough Local Education Authorities (LEA) that are responsible for schools in their \ngeographical domain, and, crucially, funding is linked to the number of pupils \nenrolled in schools. Primary schools in the state-sector fall into a number of \ndifferent categories, and differ in terms of the way they are governed, who controls \npupil admissions, and their religious affiliation (if any). In addition there is a small \nprivate, fee-paying sector, which we do not consider here.8 The key differences \nbetween the various types of state school \u2013 Community, Voluntary Controlled, \nFoundation and Voluntary Aided\u2013 are set out in Appendix Table A1. About 60% of \nthe 14500 (or so) Primary schools in England are classified as Community schools, \nwith a further 15% being Voluntary Controlled schools (predominantly Faith \nschools). Next, Foundation schools account for about 2% (86% of which are not \nconnected to a particular Faith) and Voluntary Aided for about 23% of the state-\nPrimary sector (97% of which are religiously affiliated). \nAll schools are run by a Governing Body composed of members elected \nfrom amongst parents and staff (Parent Governors and Staff Governors), members \nappointed by the LEA (LEA Governors), members appointed by the church or \ncharitable foundation that owns the school premises (where relevant \u2013 Foundation \n                                                 \n8 Private schools educate around 6%-7% of pupils in England as a whole. \n- 11 - \nGovernors), and members appointed from the community (e.g. local businesses) by \nthe Governing Body. The Governing Body sets the strategic direction of the school, \ndraws up school policies, sets targets and monitors performance, although day-to-\nday running is down to the head teacher (principal) and his or her leadership team. \nThe constitution of the Governing Body is crucial because it determines how much \ninfluence various stakeholders have in the way the school is run and, in particular, \nthe balance between control by the LEA and control by the church or charitable \nfoundation associated with the school.  For the purpose of our analysis, the most \nimportant distinction is the one between Voluntary Aided schools, where the \ncharity or foundation has a controlling majority within the Governing body and so \na strong influence on the running of the school, and all other types of schools \nwhere governance is shared more equally among LEA representatives, teaching \nstaff and parents. We suspect the arrangement in \u201cmajority controlled\u201d Voluntary \nAided schools to be more conducive to a focused, competitive ethos in which the \nsetting of targets, drawing up of strategies, adoption of technologies and \nmonitoring of performance will be seen as a way to attract pupils through the \npromise of excellence. On the other hand, in other \u201cnon-majority controlled\u201d \nschool types, there is a greater need to balance the objective of high standards for \nhigh-achieving children with appropriate education for children from diverse \nbackgrounds, including those with English as additional language and those with \nspecial educational needs. These distinctions are important when considering the \ndifferent incentives that competition may have for different school types. \nOverall, all LEAs and schools must organise their admissions arrangements \nin accordance with the current (statutory) Department of Education and Skills \nSchool Admissions Code of Practice. The guiding principle of this document is that \nparental choice should be the first consideration when ranking applications to a \nPrimary school. Yet if the number of applicants exceeds the number of available \n- 12 - \nplaces, almost any criterion which is not discriminatory, does not involve selection \nby ability and can be clearly assessed by parents, can be used to prioritise \napplicants.9 These vary in detail, but preference is usually given first to children \nwith special educational needs, next to children with siblings in the school and to \nthose children who live closest. For Faith schools, regular attendance at designated \nlocal churches (or other expressions of religious commitment) is foremost. Note \nthat less than 50% of pupils attend their closest Community school, which shows \nthat there is not a one-to-one mapping between where a child lives and where they \ngo to school and suggests that parents have some scope to exercise their \u201cright to \nchoose\u201d. \nHowever, one important restriction applies. Families are allowed to apply to \nschools in LEAs other than their LEA of residence, but parents must make separate \napplications to other LEAs, and, more importantly, LEAs do not have a statutory \nrequirement to find a school for pupils from other LEAs: the law only requires that \nthey provide enough schools for pupils in \u201ctheir area\u201d.10 As a result, banking on \nadmission to a popular school in another LEA is a high-risk strategy, and cross-\nLEA attendance is not commonplace in Primary schools. In our study area in and \naround London only 4.7% of Community school pupils, 3% of Voluntary \nControlled pupils and 6% of Foundation school pupils attend a school located \n                                                 \n9 LEAs now publish their admissions policy, complete with information on historical patterns of \nadmission in each school in their jurisdiction (for example Barnet, 2005; Enfield, 2005) \n10 The Education Act 1996 section 14 reads: \u201c(1)A Local Education Authority shall secure that \nsufficient schools for providing (a) Primary education, and  (b) education that is Secondary education \nby virtue of section 2(2)(a), are available for their area. (2) The schools available for an area shall not \nbe regarded as sufficient for the purposes of subsection (1) unless they are sufficient in number, \ncharacter and equipment to provide for all pupils the opportunity of appropriate education\u201d \n- 13 - \noutside their home LEA. For Voluntary Aided schools, the rate of LEA crossing is \nslightly higher, but is still only about 10%. \nAs to the actual extent of competition faced by Primary schools, it is \nimportant to notice that state Primary schools are universally non-selective by \nability, do not have explicit curriculum specialisations, and are mixed gender. Yet \nthere is considerable heterogeneity in terms of their performance, and enrolment \nrates are likely to be elastic with respect to quality measures, as evidenced by \nresearch on the house price effects of Primary school performance in England \n(Gibbons and Machin, 2003, 2006; Cheshire and Sheppard 2004). Given that \nPrimary institutions are mainly funded according to pupil numbers, schools have \nstrong incentives to attract pupils by improving educational standards:11 failing \nschools are under threat of falling enrolment, shrinking funding and reduced \npersonnel and could eventually be closed. Popular schools on the other hand \nreceive growing numbers of applications, more resources and are able to expand. In \naddition, high-flying schools can receive extra resources and recognition for their \nexcellence (e.g. so called \u201cBeacon schools\u201d) and headteacher pay schemes are \nexplicitly linked to performance.  \nOne final remark is worth making: we expect these competition incentives to \nbe stronger in Voluntary Aided schools, where the church or charitable foundation \nmanages the school admission systems via the Governing body and so is directly \nresponsible for attracting pupils and funding. On the other hand, numbers in \nundersubscribed \u201cnon-majority controlled\u201d schools, such as Community schools \n                                                 \n11 As already mentioned, schools are funded on a per-pupil basis (with adjustments for special needs \nand economic deprivation); yet the marginal costs of teaching extra children within a class group are \nsmall in purely financial terms. Schools are also evaluated on the basis of pupil pass rates in national \ntests (the league tables). For these reasons it is not hard to believe that these incentives are real. \n- 14 - \nfor which the Local Education Authority handles admissions centrally, are often \ntopped up with pupils who could not be accommodated in their school(s) of choice. \nThis undoubtedly weakens the potential link between parental choice and school \ncompetition.12 \n4. Empirical Methods \n4.1. Defining and measuring choice and competition \nThe concept of competition we will use in this study is one of spatial competition \nconditional on pupils\u2019 residence: schools compete with other schools for students \nin a community in order to maximise their revenues and minimise the costs \nassociated with disruptive and hard-to-teach pupils. Even under a parental-choice \nregime of school provision (model (2) above), a family\u2019s set of available schools is \nconstrained by the distance between home and school, in part because of \ncommuting costs and in part because school admission rules have historically \nfavoured residents who live nearby. Because of this, residential locations differ in \nterms of numbers and accessibility of alternative schools, which in turn means that \nsome schools face greater competition from alternatives than do others. Since state \nschools cannot easily change location or vary their price, they can only increase \ntheir market share by offering a higher quality; these are the competition effects we \nseek in this paper.  \nOne thing should be clear from the outset: there must be variation in the \nstructure of school markets for these ideas to be empirically meaningful. Our \nempirical work considers a large metropolitan area in which there are few explicit \ndifferences in institutional arrangements that could give rise to different \n                                                 \n12 Unfortunately, we do not have access to data about how families ranked their school choices. \n- 15 - \ncompetitive configurations.13 However, our claim is that it is the spatial \narrangement of schools in relation to each other, and in relation to residential \nhousing, which gives rise to de facto variation in school accessibility and market \nstructure.14  \nThe purpose of this empirical work is to assess separately the effect of \ngreater school choice and that of greater inter-school competition on pupil \nacademic performance. Though these two ideas are conceptually distinct, they can \nbe difficult to separate. At the school level, these go hand in hand: markets in \nwhich parents have a wider choice of schools are markets in which schools face \ngreater competition from other schools. Yet for the family, the two concepts are \ndistinct. Our definitions are then as follows: choice is a property of residential \nlocation, and is dependent on the number of alternative schools from which a \nfamily can choose. Competition is a property of school location, and depends on \nthe number of alternatives available to enrolled pupils. So our measurements of \nparental choice are based on the number of schools that, according to our data, are \navailable to families living in a given location. Our measurements of competition \nare based on the range of alternatives that are available to pupils attending each \nschool. \nCompetition\/choice indices generally suffer from a number of problems. \nFirst, they can also capture urban density and school size effects, rather than \ncompetition and choice. We try to avoid this by carefully designing our measures. \nSecondly, different market configurations can arise through processes of parental \n                                                 \n13 This is unlike the markets studied by Hoxby (2000), who considers the number of school \nattendance zones in a jurisdiction. \n14 Of course, this spatial arrangement may be endogenous to pupil performance and this is something \nwe consider in our empirical work. \n- 16 - \nchoice and school location, which may be endogenous to pupil performance. For \nexample, if school places are rationed by place of residence, then parents have \ngood reason to move close to popular schools. Schools may then appear \nmonopolistic, even though it is parental choice that has compressed the \ngeographical spread of their intake. Additionally, although new school openings \nare rare, it is not implausible that the current spatial distribution of schools is \nrelated to the socioeconomic characteristics of an area and, consequently, its level \nof pupil achievement.15 We address the endogeneity of the competition and choice \nindices using an instrumental variables approach based upon a boundary \ndiscontinuity, as described below (in Section 4.3). \nTo construct our indices (which are described diagrammatically in Figure 1), \nwe start by taking advantage of the fact that our data contains information on \nschool location and pupil residential location, identified by 6 digit (1 metre) \ncoordinates derived from full address postcodes. For each school s, we define its \ntravel zone to encompass all residential postcode units that (a) are within the same \nLEA as school s and (b) are contained within a circle drawn around school s at the \nmedian of the distribution of the home-school distances for the school\u2019s pupils.16 \nOur index of school choice availability is derived using our knowledge of a \npupil\u2019s residential postcode and the travel zones of nearby schools. This index is \n                                                 \n15 It has to be emphasized though that school opening has not been common in England in recent \nyears and that very few schools were opened in the time window under analysis in our study area. \nMoreover, the location of schools, as well as the geographical distribution of specific school types \n(such as Voluntary Aided or other Faith schools), mainly reflect historical factors.  \n16 Using the median means that we are focussing on competition amongst the pupils who live nearest \nto schools. Our results are similar if we use a wider or narrower travel zone, e.g. the 25th or 75th \npercentiles. \n- 17 - \ndefined as the number of schools accessible to a pupil, i.e. the number of school \ntravel zones that encompass the pupil\u2019s residential postcode, excluding the school \nthe pupil actually attends. \nNext, the competition index is school-based and assesses the extent to which \npupils attending school s, have the option of attending other schools. This \ninformation is obtained as the average number of schools accessible to pupils in \nthe school, i.e. the average of our school choice index across pupils actually \nattending school s.17 \nNote that we have experimented with a number of alternative choice and \ncompetition measures, including the number of alternative schools and number of \ncompetitors within a fixed radius, and a Herfindahl index of pupil shares in schools \navailable within travel zones. These alternatives gave qualitatively similar result, \nbut we think our number-of-school indices are conceptually easier to interpret and \navoid imposing a priori restrictions on travel patterns.  \nFinally, the way we define the travel zones used to construct these indices \nmeans that they are not purely dependent on school density, and hence on \nurbanisation effects. For example, semi-rural and low-density suburban areas can \n(in principle) appear competitive because our definition of school accessibility is \nbased on observed pupil travel behaviour: less dense places may exhibit low school \ndensity, but still be competitive school markets because families can travel longer \ndistances more easily. Essentially, the fact that our travel zones are defined by \nrevealed preferences allows us to account for heterogeneous travel modes and time, \nand other features of choice patterns that would be obscured by more restrictive \n                                                 \n17 In all cases, when we consider pupil numbers, we count all pupils in the age 10-11 cohort who are \nfinishing Primary school and taking their Key Stage 2 tests. \n- 18 - \nassumptions such as common travel distances or common travel modes in different \nurban, suburban and semi-rural settings. \n4.2. Modelling school performance \nOur focus is on the influence of these indices on pupil achievements, where these \nare measured by standard test results. One can think of this as the effects of choice \nand\/or competition on school productivity (Hoxby, 2003), though we make no \nattempt to evaluate achievements per pound spent.18 As discussed above, more \ncompetition with other schools and greater exercise of choice amongst potential \npupils may raise a school\u2019s productivity, because it forces schools to use a more \nefficient teaching technology, or because reallocation of pupils to schools results in \nmore efficient pupil-school matches.  \nWe look for these types of influence by estimating pupil-level educational \nproduction functions that use information for the extended London metropolitan \narea (described below). The data available to us is rich in geographical detail, with \ninformation on pupil residential addresses, which makes computation of these \nchoice and competition indices feasible. However, at the time of analysis this \ninformation was only available for two years, leaving us with little useful time-\nseries variation in the indices and forcing us to adopt an essentially cross-sectional \napproach. \nThe inputs into the education production functions include the choice and \ncompetition indices, alongside a wide range of pupil, school and neighbourhood \ncharacteristics. The full details of each specification are described in the results \nsection below. The outputs of the production function are measures of pupil \nachievement relating to standard tests taken at the end of the Primary phase in \n                                                 \n18 Expenditure information at school level is not available to us. \n- 19 - \nEnglish education, at age 10\/11. There is little doubt that the outputs of a good \neducation amount to more then good results in academic tests. However, tests \nremain the simplest metric by which to judge pupil abilities, and average \nachievement in schools is the most common, if the most basic, means by which \nschool performance is assessed. We therefore use test scores as the main measure \nof pupil achievement, and focus on the gain in pupil achievement from age 6\/7 to \nage 10\/11: this stage is referred to as Key Stage 2 in the English National \nCurriculum. \nTo sum up, all our empirical models are more or less restricted versions of \nthe following specification: \n1 22 1irst irst rt st irstKS KS c c\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b5\u2032= + + + +irstx \u03b3  (1) \n \nwhere 2irstKS  is the age-10\/11 test score for pupil i, who lives in postcode r and \nattends school s in year t; 1irstKS  is the age-6\/7 test score for pupil i, who lives in \npostcode r and attends school s in year t; rtc  is a choice index for residents of \npostcode r in year t; stc  is a competition index for school s in year t; and finally \n\u2032irstx  is a vector of pupil, school, and neighbourhood characteristics, and a year \ndummy. \n4.3. Accounting for residential sorting: instrumental variables strategy \nFamilies choose where to live, and schools are one thing they consider when \nmaking that choice. More generally, where families choose to settle in relation to \nlocal schools will depend on their own characteristics and preferences, as \nresidential sorting arises from the exercise of choice through residential decisions. \nAs a consequence, the market structures we observe in our data \u2013 which are based \non the spatial configuration of school and pupil residential locations \u2013 may be \n- 20 - \nendogenous in the production of pupil achievements.19 This would be true if, for \nexample, families crowded around a high-performing school, reducing its apparent \ncompetitiveness. It would also be true if the competitive structure was indicative of \nmarket penetration by a specific school type in areas with specific socioeconomic \ncharacteristics. Because of these concerns, we need to adopt an instrumental \nvariable strategy and look for credible instruments that generate variation in our \ncompetition and choice indices, but are uncorrelated with unobserved school and \nfamily characteristics. \nOur indices all assume that residence-school distance is an important factor \nin school choice because of travel costs. The general assumption is that the \nprobability of family i attending school j decreases with distance to the school dij. \nGiven this, families are (under most conditions) more likely to choose their nearest \nschool, as the average distance to alternatives increases (other things being equal). \nTo see this, consider the following simple exposition. Suppose family utility from \nattending school j depends on distance dij and the school quality qj, with uij = aqj - \nbdij. Family i attends the nearest school k if aqj \u2013 bdij < aqk - bdik for all j, or a(qj \u2013 \nqk) < b(dij - dik). Clearly, for given values of qj, qk and dik, the probability of i \nattending k increases as dij increases, for any j. An increase in dik for any j implies \nan increase in the average distance to all alternatives to k (assuming the choice set \nis finite). \n                                                 \n19 School choice is also exercised by changing residential location (\u00e0 la Tiebout, 1956), but the aim in \nour research is to study the effects of school choice and competition taking residential decisions as \ngiven. Hence our identification strategy will be based on finding variation in school accessibility and \ncompetition that exists after residential decisions have been made and that is plausibly exogenous to \nfamily and school characteristics (we will test this assumption). Our estimates of the impact of choice \nand competition are therefore net of any effect arising through Tiebout-type choice. \n- 21 - \nOur instrumentation strategy uses this intuition, exploiting the notion that \nfamilies living near LEA boundaries face longer journeys to schools other than the \nnearest one, than do families living in locations interior to the LEA. The idea is \nbest illustrated in Figure 2. The figure shows a linear district with 5 schools k, m, n, \np, q spaced at equal intervals. Schools k and q are located at the district boundaries \nat the left and right ends of the district respectively. The dashed lines show the cost \nof reaching each school, from each point i along the linear district. The bold line \nshows the average cost of reaching schools other than the nearest school, at any \npoint i along the linear district. As can be seen, the average costs of travel to \nschools other than the nearest is higher for residents near the edge than the centre. \nThis means that residents near boundaries are more likely to attend their local \nschool, i.e. travel costs restrict choice for residents near the district boundary \nrelative to those in the centre. A further implication is that the probability that \nschool j recruits from the set of families who have j as the nearest school decreases \nwith the distance of j from the LEA boundary; so, schools near to LEA boundaries \nwill mainly enrol pupils from local families, who have that school as the nearest \nchoice.  \nIn conclusion, schools in locations close to LEA boundaries face less \ncompetition because: (a) the catchment area shrinks in radius and land area closer \nto LEA boundaries due to local pupils (who face a more restricted choice set) \ncrowding out those who would have travelled from further afield; (b) the catchment \narea may be partially truncated on one side, which is a restriction we impose by \nexcluding the few pupils who cross LEA boundaries in the calculation of our \nchoice and competition indices.20 From these arguments, we propose to use the \n                                                 \n20 As it turns out, (a) is most important in terms of driving variation in our indices. \n- 22 - \ndistance between a pupil\u2019s home and the LEA boundary as an instrument for \nschool choice, and the distance between a school and the LEA boundary as an \ninstrument for its level of competitiveness. \nThe validity of this strategy rests on a set of assumptions. First, it requires \nthat the administrative boundary increases the costs associated with access to \nservices on the opposite side of the boundary, so that they actually restrict parental \nchoice and school competition.21 Next, we require that the distributions of schools \nand school types, as well as of families, do not follow systematic patterns with \nrespect to LEA boundaries; for example, schools (or school types) and households \nshould not be more densely distributed around the LEA perimeters than the centre. \nA further assumption is that these LEA-boundary distance instruments do not have \na direct influence on school or pupil performance other than through their effects \non the choice set available to families and that they are otherwise uncorrelated with \nthe outcomes that are being analysed.22 These are empirical issues regarding the \npower and balancing properties of our instruments which we will investigate in \ndetail below when we assess the validity of our strategy. In doing so, we will \nborrow from the methodology used in Cullen et al. (2005). \n                                                 \n21 It also assumes that LEA boundaries are exogenously fixed and stable; this seems to be the case, as \nLEA boundaries were last re-drawn in 1997\/1998, and even then very few boundaries in the area we \nstudy were affected.  \n22 Similarly, we are assuming that families do not decide to move away from LEA boundaries just \nbecause they value competition in itself; they just want a good school. Hence, from the parental \nperspective, there is no reason to reside far from LEA boundaries, unless this has a direct impact on \npupils\u2019 performance. \n- 23 - \n5. Data Sources and Sample Construction \nThe empirical analysis employs a number of large and complex data sets, which we \nnow describe. The central sources of data for the empirical analysis are the \ncombined National Pupil Database (NPD) for 1996 to 2003, the Annual School \nCensus (ASC) from 1996 to 2003, and the Pupil Level Annual School Census \n(PLASC) for 2002 and 2003. These are administrative datasets made available by \nthe Department for Education and Skills (DfES) of the UK Government.  \nThe first (NPD) is a pupil-level dataset that records test results obtained by \npupils at various stages in their school careers. The first set of assessments is \nadministered at age 6\/7, at the end of what is called Key Stage 1 (KS1) in the \nNational Curriculum. The assessment comprises Reading, English and \nMathematics tests and tasks. Pupils are awarded a level of 0,1,2,3 in each subject \n(with +\/- subcategories), and these Levels can be translated into point scores \naccording to predetermined DfES rules. The second set of assessments takes place \nat age 10\/11, at the end of Key Stage 2 (KS2). The assessment comprises English, \nMaths and Science tests and pupils are awarded percentage marks in each of these; \nmarks translate into KS2 Levels 2,3,4,5 (with some +\/- subcategories), which in \nturn translate into point scores, again using standard DfES rules. We will use KS2 \nand KS1 point score information to compute a value-added measure of educational \nprogress between age 6\/7 and 10\/11. \nThe second data set (ASC) collects information on pupil and teacher \ncharacteristics at school level and is used for resource allocation and other \nadministrative purposes by central government.23 ASC was augmented from 2002 \nonwards by PLASC, which collects characteristics of pupils individually, including \n                                                 \n23 School level characteristics are based on census information covering all grades at Primary schools \n(from age 5 to age 11), so do not relate only to the cohorts in our pupil sample. \n- 24 - \ntheir residential postcodes. These can be linked to the pupil test results in the NPD \nand to school characteristics in the ASC. So the basis for our composite dataset is \nall pupils in PLASC who took KS2 tests in the school years 2001\/2002 and \n2002\/2003, and sat their KS1 tests in 1997\/1998 and 1998\/1999.  \nThis information can be linked to additional school information, in particular \nschool addresses and institution types using the DfES Record of Educational \nEstablishments (REE) and Edubase files. Moreover, to compute measures of spatial \ncompetition using Euclidian distances, we need geographic coordinates for both \nschools and pupils. These are derived from the full address postcodes using \nOrdnance Survey Codepoint data, which provide one metre grid references for \npostcode unit centroids. For some of our analyses we also include information on \npupil residential neighbourhood and family background, which we obtained by \nmatching the residential address to Census data for 2001.24 Finally, we derive LEA \nboundaries from the County and District boundaries obtainable from the UK \nBorders25 geographical information service, which we will use in our instrumental \nvariable analysis. \nAs stated above, the pupil data we use relates to age-10\/11 pupils sitting KS2 \ntests in 2001\/2-2002\/3. The sample is further restricted to pupils living in a \ngeographical zone within a 45km radius of central London, defined here as Bank \ntube station in the City of London, and to schools within the same radius.26 Our \n                                                 \n24 We identify pupil residential neighbourhoods using postcode sectors; these include a handful of \npostcode tracts and are well designed to represent the community where individuals live. \n25 Available from the Edinburgh University Data Library at www.edina.ac.uk. \n26 We start with a sample within 50km in order to construct our choice and competition indices, but \nbase estimation on the subsample within 45km. This avoids us mistakenly inferring lack of \ncompetition at the boundaries of our geographical zone.  \n- 25 - \npurpose in restricting the data is to focus on primarily urban school markets, but it \nalso substantially reduces the computational burden. One further restriction is to \neliminate partial LEAs (Luton, Bracknell) at the margins of our geographical zone, \nand in the City of London (which has a very low pupil population). \n6. Results \n6.1. Sample description \nTable 1 summarises the most important variables in the dataset, namely the pupil \nachievement indicators and competition\/choice indices. One key question concerns \nthe amount of variation in our competition measures. Clearly, if all schools serve \nonly the local community, or if any school within an LEA is easily accessible from \nany residence within an LEA, then there is no variation in the level of competition. \nOur methods assume that a mix of neighbourhood-school and parental-choice \nstructures exists, and that this will be reflected in our measures. Table 1 tabulates \nthe summary statistics for our indices, Figure 3 graphs their distributions and \nFigure 4 provides a map for part of our study area. These all show there to be \nsubstantial variation in the indices we have at hand. \nRow 1 of Table 1 shows that, on average, every 10 pupils could quite easily \nreach 14 schools from their home address, in addition to the school they actually \nattend. Remember that this index is based on whether the median travel distance of \npupils in neighbouring schools encompasses each home address, so that the \nfeasible choice set could be quite a lot larger. Averaging this choice index at the \nlevel of the school in which pupils are enrolled, we derive our competition index \n(Row 4, Table 1). The difference between the pupil and unweighted school mean \nimplies that pupils in larger schools tend to be those with more choices. Obviously, \nthe choice and competition indices are highly correlated (with a pair-wise \n- 26 - \ncorrelation of about 0.60); yet they display sufficient independent variation, from \nwhich we will separately identify the effects of school availability and \ncompetition.27 Looking at Figure 3, we see that around 1 in 4 pupils have no school \n(other than the one they attend) within a short travel distance, but only 1 in 10 \nschools have all pupils with no local alternatives. It is also worth noting that only \n48% of Community school pupils and 27% of Faith school pupils in our study area \nactually attend their nearest school within their LEA, so there is clearly \nconsiderable exercising of choice (see also Burgess et al., 2004). Finally, from the \nmap of Figure 4, we can also deduce that the competition indices are only partly \nrelated to urban centrality and density: some of the highest values of our index \noccur in suburban districts such as Barnet and Brent, whilst inner-city zones like \nsouth Hackney or Southwark exhibit low levels of competition.  \nFurther down Table 1 are other interesting features of the data. The median \ntravel distance of Primary school pupils in our study area is 743 metres, and this \ntravel zone is home to an average of 80 pupils, though the number ranges widely.28 \nWe have also computed a cohort density measure centred on each pupil\u2019s \nresidential postcode, using a count of the number of pupils aged 10\/11 within a \n564m radius of each pupil\u2019s address (a 1km2 circle). The mean pupil density is \n64.1km-2, but ranges between 1 and 256. These inter-school distance and \npopulation density variables do not feature in our competition or choice indices, \nbut are used as controls for more general urban density factors in our regression \nmodels. In addition, we will include a number of controls in these regressions, at \n                                                 \n27 This is because, for example, pupils coming from an area with little available choice may travel \nlong distances and enrol in a school which faces a highly competitive market. \n28 The average distance between a school and other schools in its travel zone is about 600 metres, \nranging from zero (i.e. two or more schools are in the same postcode) up to 4.4 km. \n- 27 - \nfour levels of aggregation: pupil, school, residential postcode sector, and LEA \nlevel.29 These are described in Appendix Table A2. \n6.2. Choice, competition and performance: regression results \nOur first results are ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of the model in \nequation 1, which are presented in Table 2. This shows the coefficients of interest \nonly, and is divided into three panels. The top panel shows estimates of the \nassociation between choice availability and pupil achievement, unconditional on \nthe index of competition at the pupil\u2019s school ( 1\u03b2  in equation 1, with 2\u03b2  restricted \nto zero). The next panel shows the association between school competition and \npupil achievement ( 2\u03b2  in equation 1, with 1\u03b2  restricted to zero). The third panel \nreports the coefficients with both choice and competition indices included together \n( 1\u03b2  and 2\u03b2 unrestricted). All columns report results where the dependent variable is \nthe pupil\u2019s change in point scores between KS1 and KS2, a direct measure of value \nadded through the National Curriculum stages. Table A3 in the Appendix reports \nresults for KS2 English and Maths test marks separately. As we did not find \ndifferent patterns for the two subjects, we decided to focus on the overall value-\nadded measures.30 Finally, notice that it is difficult to establish a priori at which \n                                                 \n29 Along with school type dummies (Community, Foundation, Voluntary Aided and Voluntary \nControlled). \n30 Controlling for prior achievement, or using achievement growth, risks underestimating the effect of \nfixed school characteristics, because prior achievement is determined by school characteristics too. \nUnfortunately the coefficient on prior achievement is also endogenous (see Todd and Wolpin, 2003) \nand potentially downward biased. Nevertheless such specifications are commonplace and we follow \ntradition. Since we have no instruments for prior achievement which would allow us to correct the \nspecification we simply note here that the coefficients on our competition and choice indices are \n- 28 - \nlevel one should cluster standard errors; therefore, we report both standard errors \nclustered at school and LEA level (in round and square brackets respectively). \nLooking at the OLS results in the first panel of Table 2, it seems clear that \nthere is an association between the number of choices a pupil has available locally \nand their achievement at school between age 7 and 11. This is true regardless of \nwhether we include the full set of controls described above. However, the \nassociation is very small in magnitude: one extra school in the pupil choice set \nrelates to about 0.1 additional value-added points. These results are qualitatively \nsimilar when we look at the school competition index on its own in the next panel. \nThis is unsurprising, since the choice and competition indices are positively \ncorrelated. Finally, when the choice and competition indices are included together, \nwe find that pupils in schools facing more competition do marginally better; yet we \nfind that choice is not associated with higher pupil performance.31 \nTaken at face value, these estimates suggest small but significant gains for \npupils in schools facing more competitive markets. However, we find it hard to \ntrust these findings, because the choice and competition indices we use are likely to \nbe endogenous to pupil and school performance. To address this, we employ the \ninstrumental variables (IV) strategy described above, using the pupil residence-\nLEA boundary distance as an instrument for choice, and the school-LEA boundary \ndistance as an instrument for competition.  \n                                                                                                                            \nalmost unchanged if we use age-11 test scores unconditional on age-7 test scores. See Table A2 in the \nAppendix. \n31 We also assessed whether the impact of competition\/choice mainly comes from under- or over-\ncapacity schools. Our results suggest that: (a) competition always matters more than choice; (b) most \nof the effect comes from schools that have a potential for expansion (under-capacity). This \u201cthreat \neffect\u201d is in line with predictions from the empirical IO literature. \n- 29 - \nThe IV coefficient estimates are presented in columns (3) and (4) of Table 2, \nand tell a very different story. The signs on all the coefficients become negative, \nalthough statistically insignificant.32 Starting from the top panel, there is now no \nevidence to suggest that an increase in the number of schools available near a \npupil\u2019s home (as we move away from an LEA boundary) improves pupil \nachievement. A Hausman test of the hypothesis that the IV coefficient on the \nchoice index in column (4) is equal to the OLS estimate of column (2) rejects the \nnull with a p-value of 0.0363. Notice that this coefficient identifies an average \neffect of school availability, i.e. both for individuals who exercise choice and opt \nout of their local schools, and for individuals who are left in the local institution. \nWithout further assumptions, we cannot disentangle a pure pupil-school matching \neffect from indirect spill-over effects. Similarly, we do not find evidence that \nattendance at a school that faces more competition further away from an LEA \nboundary improves achievement (central panel). The IV coefficient for the \ncompetition index is always negative, though not significant, and a test that the IV \nestimate in column (4) is equal to the OLS coefficient in column (2) rejects the null \nwith a p-value of 0.0481. Finally, when we include the choice and competition \nindices together in our regressions (bottom panel), we come to similar conclusions: \nneither increased choice nor fiercer competition away from LEA boundaries \nsignificantly increases pupil achievement. A test on the two IV coefficients in \ncolumn (4) being jointly equal to the OLS estimates in column (2) speaks against \nthe null with a p-value of 0.0869. In conclusion, all these point estimates suggest \nthat moves away from an LEA boundary could have small adverse effects on \nachievement, though they are imprecisely determined. \n                                                 \n32 Remarkably, our results are similar whether we include the full set of controls or not; this reassures \nus as to the validity of our instrumental variable approach. \n- 30 - \n6.3. Assessing the instrumental variables strategy \nIt is reasonable to ask whether, given these results, LEA boundary distance \nmeasures are good instruments for the choice and competition indices. An \nimportant assumption for the instrument to determine choice and competition is \nthat cross-LEA Primary school attendance is not widespread. From the Pupil \nCensus data we have established that the proportion of entry-age children (age-4) \nattending schools in an LEA outside their home LEA is only around 5.5%, and \nslightly lower for Community schools at around 4.7%. Moreover, of the 10% of \npupils who live closest to the LEA boundaries, well over 80% attend Primary \nschools within their own LEA. This is particularly reassuring, as these pupils are \ntypically in postcodes that are immediately adjacent to the boundary and might be \nequally likely to attend a school in the adjacent LEA as in their own LEA if the \nboundary imposed no barrier. \nWhilst this suggests that our distance measures could be good predictors of \nschool choice and competition, the deciding factor on the power of these \ninstruments boils down to whether the first stages of the IV regressions are \neffective. These are tabulated in Table 3, where we report results for specifications \nincluding and excluding controls, and with standard errors clustered at school or \nLEA level. The instruments \u2013 the log of boundary distances \u2013 are always very \npowerful. A 10% increase in the distance from LEA boundary to pupil residence \nincreases the number of schools in the pupil\u2019s choice set by 0.027, or about 2% \nrelative to the mean (0.027\/1.404). A 10% increase in LEA boundary-school \ndistance increases the average number of alternative schools for pupils in that \nschool by about 0.02. The instruments are individually significant and the F-\nstatistic for the joint test of the instruments is always high (Staiger and Stock, \n- 31 - \n1997). In a nutshell, LEA boundary distance measures are indeed strong predictors \nof choice availability and school competition. \nFurther results (not tabulated) also show that the instrument for choice (and \nindirectly, competition) works in line with the theoretical reasoning we used to \njustify its use. First, for each 1% increase in distance between a pupil\u2019s residence \nand the nearest LEA boundary there is a 1.4 percentage point decrease in the \nprobability that the pupil attends the nearest school (controlling for the average \npupil-boundary distance within the LEA). Secondly, the average distance between \na pupil\u2019s residence and the nearest 4 schools (other than the one he or she actually \nattends, and within the LEA of residence) decreases by 0.06% for each 1% increase \nin the distance between their home and the boundary. In other words, pupils near \nadmissions-district boundaries seem to be more constrained in their choice of \nschool. Finally, we dropped the restriction of no-LEA-crossing to compute our \nindices, and reran the IV analysis (presented in Appendix Table A4, columns (1) \nand (2)). First stage results show that distances to LEA boundaries are still strong \npredictors of competition and choice. As explained before, we expect the \ninstruments to work if boundaries are effective barriers, even if we include \nboundary-crossers (very few) in our indices. This is because the composition of the \nintake in a less-competitive school close to an LEA boundary will be weighted \ntowards restricted-choice pupils living in the immediate vicinity. This shrinks the \ncatchment area radius relative to schools located more centrally within the LEA, \nand so influences the choice and competition indices in the surrounding area. \nOne further concern relates to the fact that some of the variation in our \nchoice and competition indices could be generated by differences in how far pupils \ntravel to school, a factor which is plausibly correlated with preferences over \nschooling and family resources. For instance, looking at Figure 2, if pupils differ in \nterms of their transport costs (e.g. some have cars and some do not), then those \n- 32 - \nwith the lowest costs per unit of travel distance will be best placed to exercise \nchoice and attend the most competitive schools. In other words, home-school \ndistance is a potentially important omitted variable when we use our boundary-\ndistance IV strategy. However, our instrumental variable strategy does not \nsystematically rely on differences in travel distance to identify the causal effect of \nschool competition on pupil achievement. It instead contrasts pupils living in the \nsame neighbourhood but travelling in different directions: towards the centre of the \nLEA or towards a boundary (for example, looking again at Figure 2, our \ncompetition instrument compares pupils who live at, say, p and attend a school at \nq, with others who live at p but attend a school at n). We do not think there is a \nstrong theoretical case for individual unobservable characteristics being related to \ndirection of travel. Nevertheless, in order to directly address this issue, in columns \n(3) and (4) of Appendix Table A4 we replicate our IV analysis controlling for the \ndistance between home and the school a pupil actually attends. The results are \nessentially unchanged and this set of estimates confirms our previous findings, \nsuggesting that differences in costs or preferences associated with home-school \ntravel distance are not biasing our estimates. \nFinally, one crucial assumption behind our strategy is that school or \nresidence distance from LEA boundaries is uncorrelated with unobserved pupil and \nschool characteristics that may influence educational outcomes. This assumption \nmight be violated if, for example, there were geographical differences between \nplaces close to LEA boundaries and places further away, and residential sorting led \nto differences in the distributions of pupil characteristics in these areas. Although \nthis assumption is ultimately untestable, we can provide some evidence in support \nof it by demonstrating that our instruments are not strongly correlated with \nobservable school and residential neighbourhood characteristics. To do so, we \n- 33 - \nborrow from the methodology in Cullen et al. (2005) and perform balancing tests \nfor the two instruments separately. Results are reported in Tables 4 and 5. \nIn the first of the two tables, we investigate the validity of the instrument for \nschool choice. The aim is to test whether the distance between home and the LEA \nboundary (relative to the mean within the LEA) is correlated with the level and \ndiversity of various neighbourhood attributes that might in turn be linked to family \nbackground and hence pupil performance at school.  Since we are concerned \nprimarily with factors that are unobserved in our models, we test whether the \ndistance between pupil residence and the LEA boundary (or rather its natural \nlogarithm) is correlated with various neighbourhood characteristics not included as \ncontrols in our specifications, both conditional on these controls and \nunconditionally. These are derived from the UK Census 2001, from the UK Land \nRegistry and from our pupil and school datasets. We implement these tests by \naggregating all data to the postcode-sector33 level (about 2500 households), \ncalculating the distance from the LEA boundary to the postcode sector centroid34 \nand regressing each neighbourhood characteristic separately on neighbourhood-\nLEA boundary distance, both with and without controls. \nThe regression coefficients and standard errors from this analysis are in \ncolumn (1) and (2) of Table 4. The neighbourhood attributes considered are: the \n                                                 \n33 Full UK postcodes are typically of the form AB# #CD, where # is numeric. Deleting the last two \ncharacters generates a postcode sector code. At this level we can calculate means and standard \ndeviations of the characteristics recorded in our pupil and school data at the full postcode level (10 or \nso households), and in the UK Census at the Census Output Area  level (around 50-100 households). \n34 The reasons for this aggregation are: (a) we are interested in potential within-neighbourhood \nheterogeneity in pupil characteristics and housing prices as well as differences in means; and (b) the \nneighbourhood controls in our regressions are at this geographical level. See footnote 24 above. \n- 34 - \ndispersion of school achievement of peers in the neighbourhood (standard \ndeviation of KS1 grades);35 the number of private schools; the average and \nstandard deviation of log house prices; the fractions of adult individuals working \nand economically active in the neighbourhood; the fractions of adults retired from \nwork and sick or disabled in the neighbourhood; and a measure for the \nhomogeneity of educational attainment of adults in the neighbourhood (a \nHerfindhal index). Descriptive statistics are reported in column (3), and the number \nof available observations is reported in column (4) of Table 4; the latter varies \nbetween 1133 and 1181 due to some missing values. Whether or not we include the \nfull set of controls in the regression, we find neither significant nor sizable \nrelationships between any these measures and the distance between residential \nneighbourhood and the LEA boundary.36  \nIn Table 5 we repeat this analysis, this time aggregating our data to school \nlevel and regressing school level characteristics on school-LEA boundary distance. \nThe aim here is to test the validity of the instrument for our competition index, \nwhich varies only across schools, by checking whether the characteristics of \n                                                 \n35 We do not report tests that relate age-7 (KS1) pupil achievement to LEA boundary distances, \nbecause these are used to construct our value-added measures. Nevertheless, we found no significant \nevidence that early-age grades are related to school or home distances from school district boundaries. \n36 In line with the analysis so far, we cluster standard errors at the LEA level to take care of potential \nspatial correlation of observations across different postcode sector within localised areas (LEAs). \nHowever, one should also note that the outcomes in each equation are potentially correlated with each \nother within postcode sectors, suggesting that a Seemingly Unrelated Regressions setup might \nimprove efficiency. In fact, as the set of controls is identical in each equation, SURE does not provide \nany more information than OLS, even though the SURE and OLS estimates are marginally different \nbecause of differing sample sizes in each regression. In any case, we have tried a SURE approach and \nthis led to almost identical conclusions. \n- 35 - \nschools located close to district boundaries differ systematically from those further \naway. We consider a number of school characteristics. First, we compute a \nmeasure of the dispersion of achievement of peers based on age-7 grades of pupils \nin the cohort under analysis (standard deviation of KS1 grades within school), \naveraged over the two years in our sample. Then, using age-7 grades of pupils in \nthe two cohorts immediately adjacent to those in our sample (i.e. pupils aged 7 in \n1999\/2000 and 2000\/2001), we compute school averages of KS1 grades and \ndispersion of early-stage attainment within school (the standard deviation of KS1 \ngrades); we again average these over the two years.37 Next, using Annual School \nCensus information, we construct two measures of the ratio of support staff to \nqualified teachers for the schools across all different stages (i.e. overall, from age 5 \nto age 11). Finally, we measure distances from schools to main roads and the \nnumber of schools within 1km (including those across LEA boundaries). These \nschool-level regression results, with and without controls, are reported in columns \n(1) and (2) in Table 5. Descriptive statistics and the number of observations for \nthese variables are reported in columns (3) and (4). Once more, we find no \nevidence for a significant association between these variables and our instrument.38  \n                                                 \n37 Unfortunately, we do not have access to the information required to compute these two indices for \ncohorts younger than those in our sample. \n38 We have tested explicitly whether students\u2019 characteristics are correlated with the boundary-to-\nschool distance of the school that they attend. To do so, we regressed pupil characteristics on the log \nof the school-to-boundary distance in the pupil-level dataset, both with and without residential \npostcode fixed effects. In no case could we find any significant association between pupil \ncharacteristics and the school-to-boundary distance. This evidence rules out family decisions about \ndirection of travel to school (towards or away from the LEA boundary) as a potential unobserved \nsource of correlation between our instrument and pupil achievement.  \n- 36 - \nEverything here indicates that both choice and competition in Primary \nschooling increase exogenously as pupils and schools move away from LEA \nboundaries. In support of the assumption discussed above, we find that our distance \nmeasures do not simply capture features of schools next to LEA boundaries, nor do \nthey reflect other neighbourhood characteristics which may have a direct influence \non school or pupil performance. However, results in Table 2 show no systematic \nimpact of choice and competition on pupil performance. The natural interpretation \nof this is that the positive, but small, association between pupil performance and \ncompetition indices seen in the ordinary least squares estimates is attributable to \nendogenous pupil sorting. \n6.4. Heterogeneous effects: majority vs. non-majority controlled schools \nThe difference between the OLS and IV estimates in Table 2 clearly warrants \nfurther exploration, and it is to this that we now turn. As we discussed in Section 3, \nthere are important institutional differences between state-funded Primary schools \nin England, particularly in terms of governance and admissions procedures. These \ndistinctions may be important when considering how different school types react to \nschool competition incentives. At one extreme, \u201cmajority controlled\u201d Voluntary \nAided schools are likely to be highly responsive to competition. The foundation or \ncharitable institution that owns the school premises has majority representation on \nthe Governing body and so has a strong influence over the running of the school. \nBecause Voluntary Aided schools are also directly responsible for their own pupil \nadmissions, and since funding is linked to pupil numbers, strategies promoting \nexcellence, monitoring performance and rewarding outstanding teaching will be \npromoted as a means to attract pupils. In other school types, governance is shared \nmore equally between LEA representatives, teaching staff and parents, and the \nschool foundation; as a result, less emphasis will be placed on targets and \n- 37 - \ninnovative teaching methods, and more on balancing a range of different \nobjectives. Furthermore, admissions to \u201cnon-majority controlled\u201d schools are more \ntightly controlled by the Local Education Authority (either directly or via the \nGoverning Body), which may have an incentive to reallocate some pupils whose \npreferred schools are over-subscribed to schools that are under-subscribed. These \ninstitutional arrangements clearly have the potential to weaken the link between \nparental choice, school competition and pupil achievement. \nGiven these considerations, we now separately examine pupils in \u201cmajority \ncontrolled\u201d schools and pupils in \u201cnon-majority controlled\u201d schools (Community, \nVoluntary Controlled and Foundations), and study whether choice and competition \nhave different effects for these two subgroups. Results are reported in Table 6. \nColumns (1) and (3) present OLS results for majority and non-majority controlled \ninstitutions respectively. For both school types, we still find that choice is not \nsignificantly associated with pupil achievement. More interestingly, we find that \ncompetition is positively related to performance in \u201cmajority controlled\u201d schools, \nbut that this is not the case for schools where governance is more under LEA \ncontrol. While this suggests that competition may improve average achievement \nfor pupils in schools that, we have argued, are likely to be more responsive to \nincentives, it may also be driven by the endogeneity of the choice and competition \nindices to pupil and school performance.  \nTo address this issue, we reproduce our IV strategy for these two groups; \nresults are presented in column (2) and (4) of Table 6. First stage statistics reported \nat the bottom of the table show that our instruments based on school and residence \ndistance to LEA boundaries are still effective for the two groups separately. Yet the \nIV coefficients for the effect of school competition on pupil achievement have \nopposite signs for majority and non-majority controlled institutions. For the latter \nwe find a small, negative and marginally significant association between \n- 38 - \ncompetition and achievement. One additional competitor (about one standard \ndeviation of our competition index) is associated with 0.893 point lower value-\nadded, accounting for about 10% of its standard-deviation. However, we find a \nsizeable and positive impact of school competition on pupil achievement for \nmajority-controlled schools. While this is only significant at the 10% level, the \neffect is quite large: the competition threat associated with one extra school \navailable to pupils increases the value-added by 1.6 points, accounting for more \nthan 20% of its standard deviation. A test for the IV coefficients on the choice and \ncompetition indices being simultaneously equal across the two sub-groups does not \nprovide strong support for the null, with a p-value of 0.0503; more interestingly, \nwhen we test only whether the IV estimates of the effect of school competition are \nthe same for the two groups, we strongly reject this hypothesis with a p-value of \n0.0195. \nOverall, these findings support the existence of a beneficial effect of \ncompetition on pupil achievement in a setting in which schools combine more \nresponsive governance (mainly via institutional arrangements) with greater \nautonomy in admission procedures. It should be emphasized that these schools are \na relatively important group in the state Primary education system, enrolling more \nthan 20% of the pupils. However, a more conservative interpretation should take \ninto account the possibility that competition may come at the cost of lower pupil \nattainment in schools that do not benefit from independence and flexibility in their \nmanagement, potentially increasing school segregation along the lines of pupil \nattainment. This divergence in results between \u201cmajority controlled\u201d and \u201cnon-\nmajority controlled\u201d schools suggests that school competition might not be \u201ca \nrising tide that lifts all boats\u201d (Hoxby, 2003). \n- 39 - \n7. Concluding Remarks \nIn this paper we have attempted to identify the causal links between choice and \ncompetition and the academic achievement of Primary school pupils. To do so we \nhave carefully constructed measures of the Primary school choices available to \npupils based on the equilibrium accessibility of schools to their homes. From this \nwe also derived competition measures for the schools at which these pupils are \nenrolled. Choice and competition indices were related to pupil achievements in \nPrimary schools, first in a simple least squares setting and then using an \ninstrumental variables approach based on a boundary discontinuity affecting school \nattendance. \nSimple least squares results show a small positive association between \nschool competition and achievement: pupils tend to do better if they are enrolled in \nschools that serve more competitive markets. Yet we found little evidence that it is \ncompetition that drives the gain in achievement; pupil sorting, endogenous travel \npatterns, and school location provide more plausible explanations for these \nfindings. Once endogeneity issues are controlled for, pupil achievement is \ngenerally unrelated to the competitive pressures a school faces. It is only in \n\u201cmajority controlled\u201d schools, which have more freedom in governance and \nadmission practices, that competition appears to be positively linked to \nperformance. This is likely to be attributable to their potentially more responsive \ninstitutional arrangements and to factors like proactive governance and religious \nfervour. However, there is weaker evidence that school competition might be \ndetrimental to pupil learning in schools in which governance is shared more \nequally among stakeholders and the Local Educational Authority retains more \ncontrol over school management, teacher recruitment, and admissions. \nThese findings matter for the often heated debate about whether choice and \ncompetition improve pupil performance. There is some comfort here for advocates \n- 40 - \nof choice and competition as pathways to higher educational standards: our \nevidence suggests that competition may improve school performance for some of \nthe one-in-five students who attend Voluntary Aided schools. However, our results \ncast some doubt on the general effectiveness of choice and competition in the \nschool context: they imply that such pressures only operate in a specific subset of \nthe Primary school market and possibly at the cost of polarisation of schools along \nthe dimension of pupil achievement. There are, of course, a number of other issues \nthat could usefully be studied here. For example, we do not consider competition \nfrom private schools (largely for data reasons); nor can we study parental \npreferences in any direct way. Incorporating these factors into future work (both \ntheoretical and applied) would seem to be a useful direction in which to go. \n \n- 41 - \n \nFigure 1: Schematic presentation of the choice and competition measures \n \n \nNote: Numbers 0,1,2,3 indicate the choice index that would be assigned to pupils living in each area (assuming \nthey attend school s) \n \n  \nCompetitive Non-competitive \n3 2\n2 1\n1 \n0\n0\ns s\n- 42 - \n \nFigure 2: Illustration of the instrumentation strategy \n \n \nNote: Figure shows a linear district with 5 schools, k, m, n, p, q; dij is the distance to each school; id  is the \naverage distance to schools other than the nearest. \n \n \nk m p \nd \nd \nd \nd \ni d \nim \nin \nip \nn q \nik d \nd \nd \nd \niq \nip \nin \nim \n- 43 - \n \nFigure 3: Distributions of the choice and competition indices \n0\n.1\n.2\n.3\n.4\nFr\nac\ntio\nn\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n \n0\n.0\n2\n.0\n4\n.0\n6\n.0\n8\n.1\nFr\nac\ntio\nn\n0 2 4 6 8\n \n \nPupil choice index: Number of schools accessible from \npupil\u2019s home \nSchool competition index: Number of schools accessible \nto pupils, average in school attended \n- 44 - \nFigure 4: Primary school competition in the Greater London Area \n \nNote: Figure shows local averages of the school-level competition index (Inverse Distance Weighted means of the nearest 6 schools on a 250m raster).
