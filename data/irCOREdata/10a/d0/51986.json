A detailed analysis has been carried out to investigate the potential of \nstrawbale through analysis of embodied and operational CO2 emissions in the \nWaddington social housing project recently completed in Lincolnshire in the UK by \ncomparing some alternative domestic external wall constructions and the effects on \nthe CO2 emissions that would result.   \n \nIt is estimated that over fifteen tonnes of CO2 may be stored in biotic materials of \neach of the semi detached houses of which around six tonnes are sequestered by straw \nand the remaining by wood and wood products.  Our analysis indicate that the carbon \nlockup potential of renewable materials used in the construction of the house is \ncapable of reducing the whole life CO2 emissions of the house over its sixty years \ndesign life by 61% compared with the case without sequestration.   \n \nThe paper also discusses the practical implications of construction, detailing, \nmaintenance, cost and selfbuild potentials of strawbale construction.  The paper \nconcludes by demonstrating the potential of loadbearing strawbale walls and \n 4\ncompares the whole life performance of strawbale construction with alternative \nconventional external walling systems.  \n. \nKey words: CO2 emissions, embodied energy, operational energy, strawbale, social \nhousing, cost.  \n 5\nIntroduction  \nBuilding life cycle demands the consideration of both direct and indirect energy \nconsumed during a life time of a building. The former is associated with construction, \noperation, maintenance and deconstruction however the latter primarily encompasses \nthe energy needed to produce building materials, i.e. the embodied material burden. \nThe distribution of energy consumption and impacts are generally concentrated in the \noperational phase of a building however with the improvement in building \nregulations and zero energy building concepts,  this proportion is likely to change in \nthe near future.  Sartori and Hestness (2006) in an analysis of 60 residential case \nstudies found that the in-use phase represents by far the largest part of energy demand \nin a building during its life cycle. They also concluded that there is a linear relation \nbetween the in-use and total energy, i.e. the sum of all the energy used by a building \nduring its life cycle, which is valid through all the 60 case studies despite the climate \nand other contextual differences (e.g. for different size and type of buildings etc.). \nThis is apparently due to the dominant role of the in-use energy that reduces the \ninfluence of all other differences.  Scheuer et al. (2003) emphasize that in-use energy \nperformance should still be the primary emphasis for design, until there is a \nsignificant shift in distribution of life cycle burdens.  \n \nIn the current economic climate customer demand for new low carbon housing might \nbe limited but it is anticipated that low carbon housing will be a growing market \nespecially in wake of the approaching zero carbon homes target.  Osmani and \nO\u2019Reilly (2009) identify many barriers including design, technical, cultural, \n 6\nlegislative, and financial barriers in designing and building energy efficient housing \nin England and assert that in the current financial climate, the Government is likely to \nface many challenges to meet these zero carbon targets.  \n \nAs housing is bound by legislation in the UK to become more energy efficient in \noperational energy with increased insulation levels, better air tightness, and the use of \nmore energy efficient equipment and appliances, the relative importance of other \nimpacts such as the initial and the end of life will become more significant in the \nwhole life impact analysis. To reduce the initial impact, attention should be paid first \nto embodied energy of materials specified and secondly to the impact of the \nconstruction process.  To reduce the end of life impact, in addition to an attempt to \nincrease the life span of a building through the application of design principles for \nadaptability and flexibly, and good maintenance, refurbishment and conversion, \nrecyclability of all materials should also be considered.   Ding (2007) states that life \ncycle energy consumption requires a comprehensive energy analysis to cover energy \nconsumption throughout the buildings\u2019 economic lifespan.  \n \nBy using a social housing project as a case study, the aim of this paper is to \ndemonstrate the potential of renewable materials in meeting a typical construction \nneed in the UK and that design decisions based on carbon emissions must take into \naccount the impacts of all stages throughout the economic lifespan of a building. \nEmbodied and operational emissions could be reduced by careful choice of materials \nand construction techniques.  The paper focuses on illustrating the role of lifecycle \n 7\nanalysis of strawbale as a construction material in defining embodied impact and \ndemonstrates the variance in performance between strawbale wall construction in \ncomparison to conventional new build home walling constructions. \n \nScope and methodology  \nThe paper discusses the potential of strawbale as building material and analyses the \nCO2 emissions resulting from constructing and operating a pair of semi-detached \nhomes in a social housing project in the UK. The study specifically analyses the \nembodied emissions of the materials used in the building and the operational \nemissions coming from its annually repeating operational energy demand. It also \ninvestigates the resulting effect on embodied and on the operational CO2 emissions \nbased on a 60 years nominal life span by changing the envelope of the houses using \nother wall construction that are typically used in housing within the UK.  Other \nmetrics and criteria for sustainable design and construction have not been discussed \nin any depth in this paper however the design of the houses has considered these \naspects. \n \nOnly the embodied emissions of the main materials used in the shell construction of \nhouses are considered and the effects of materials such as interior finishes (such as \ncarpets, skirting boards, fixtures and fittings, sanitary services, electrical and \nmechanical services, sealants, and other minor elements) are excluded.  These \nelements which have not been specified as part of the base build, would be the same \nfittings and fixtures in all of the wall construction alternatives modelled, would be \n 8\nselected by the tenant and are considered to be largely of low significance to the total \nembodied impact.  \n \nCarbon emission inventory data was developed mainly from Bath University \nInventory of Carbon and Energy (Bath ICE, 2006) and manufacturer\u2019s data where the \ndata were not available in Bath ICE. Bath ICE is a publicly available embodied \nenergy and carbon dataset representing typical building materials employed in the \nBritish market and hence used to assess most of the installed materials in this study.  \nThe range of materials this dataset includes represents conventional construction and \ncomposites and there is a need to produce accurate local datasets with the possibility \nto compare international assessments and further alternative and innovative materials. \n \nStandard Assessment Procedure1 (SAP) (BRE, 2005)  which is adopted by the UK \ngovernment as part of the national methodology for demonstrating compliance with \nbuilding regulations and for providing energy ratings for dwellings was used to \nquantify the annually repeating operational impacts.  SAP methodology is well \nestablished in the UK to assess housing, and the government dictates conversion rates \nfor services and energy supplies to CO2 used and are used here to demonstrate \noperational performance and provide a level platform for comparison, even though \nthere may be criticisms about both the rating methodology and the factors used within \nit. This study is focused on UK climatic and industry conditions however as strawbale \nconstruction is widely used in rest of the world, the analysis drawn by the paper may \nbe applied to other locations.   \n 9\n \nThe alternatives considered are replacing strawbale walls with masonry and timber \nwalling systems.  The results provide an insight into the effect of the type of \nconstruction on the total amount of CO2 emissions, and the relevance of carbon \nstorage potential and end of life implications of renewable materials.  \n \nHouse Description  \nA pair of semi-detached council houses of loadbearing straw (i.e. no framework) \nconstruction and using predominantly natural materials have recently been completed \nfor North Kesteven District Council at Waddington in Lincolnshire, UK. They are \nbased on traditional UK social housing design, standard semi-detached, two-storey, \n3-bedroomed houses each with an internal gross area of 85.75m2  which is 4m2 above \nthe Housing Quality Indicator2 (HQI) (Drury et al., 2006).  The gross external floor \narea of each house is 104.50m2 including strawbale walls of 450mm with 30mm lime \non both sides.  The party wall between the pair is also of loadbearing straw, plastered \nboth sides with lime, which provides a fire and acoustic break between the houses. \nVisually, these houses are similar in scale and form to the rest of the council housing \nestate on which they are built, and have hipped roofs of clay tiles. They differ in that \nthey are rendered with lime and painted a buttermilk colour rather than being clad in \ncement slabs, as are the nearby post-war council houses.  Householders enter from the \nstreet via the north, with a green-roofed porch to give protection to the external door, \na coat closet and toilet, before entering into the open plan living\/dining\/kitchen space \n(Figure 1).    \n 10\n \nThe houses are on east-west axis with the main orientations facing south and north. \nForty percent of the south facing elevation is glazed, maximizing passive solar heat \ngain in early spring, late autumn and the winter months. The northern aspect has \nmuch less glazing and fewer windows. Upstairs, the bathroom is located on the north, \nwith the two double bedrooms with balcony access facing south and the smaller \nsingle bedroom having a small north window and either an eastern or western full \nlength window (Figure 2).  Figures 3 and 4 show cross sections through the houses. \nFigure 5 shows the southern aspect of the houses.   The pair of strawbale houses at \nWaddington have cost \u00a3103,770 per house to build giving a price of \u00a31210\/ m\u00b2.  \n \nConstruction Philosophy  \nThe primary driver was that the houses would be low carbon in construction and use.  \nTheir fabric is designed to minimize the environmental impact by using readily \navailable low\u2013embodied energy natural materials. In addition, materials have been \nlocally sourced to minimize transportation to the site. A standard strawbale is 450mm \nwide, which determines the foundation width, and by using a 100mm brick outer \nskin, with a 140mm recycled glass rigid insulation inner skin and 200mm of shredded \nlightweight recycled insulation aggregate laid like hardcore in the centre (Figure 6), a \nU-Value of 0.17W\/m\u00b2K has been achieved within the plinth foundation. Figure 7 \nshows the detailed section through the wall foundation. It is essential that the plinth is \nnot a cold bridge because the floor construction is dropped below the level of the \nplinth to keep the finished floor level low to enable wheelchair access and strawbale \n 11\nwalls need a plinth foundation to raise the straw above the ground by 300-450mm to \nprotect the straw from splash back from rainfall.  \n \nThe ground and first floors are constructed of timber joists designed to span the \nhouses without need for intermediate support. The ground floor contains 20mm \nwoodfibre board placed on the flanges of the joists with 200mm sheep\u2019s wool \ninsulation and FSC certified SmartPly tongue & groove boarding above, with natural \nwool underlay and a wool carpet. The first floor utilises hardboard on the flanges to \ncontain 10mm of sand (acoustic barrier) with a similar floor build up to the ground \nfloor but no sheep\u2019s wool except in the section directly over the external walls, which \nis totally filled.  \n \nThe first floor was constructed beside the foundations and craned onto the walls as a \nsingle unit for each house, with a 30mm gap for fire protection between them filled \nwith sand. In this method the bales take the weight of the floors and roof eliminating \nthe need for a structural framework. They are placed together like giant bricks, pinned \nto the base plate (a continuous timber plate that sits on top of the foundation plinth) \nand to each other with coppiced hazel, and a continuous rigid timber ring beam on top \nspreads the floor and\/or roof loads across the width of the wall (Figure 8).  \n \nFor two-storey houses, the floor joists at first-floor level are attached to the ring beam \nbefore building up the straw walls again beneath the roof. The roof plate (a \ncontinuous rigid plate that sits on top of the walls and under the roof) is fastened to \n 12\nthe bales with coppiced hazel and may be fastened down to the foundations with \npolyester strapping if the roof load is light, or a possibility of strong winds. The roof \nis constructed on top of the roof plate, following straw bale design principles. \n \nIn the Waddington houses the weight of the floor and the roof themselves, together \nwith sacks of sand were used to compress the straw, and fastened the floor\/roof \nstructure down by attaching it to the uprights either side of each door and window \nopening. The change to this method of building, which essentially pre-fabricates a lot \nof the structure, utilising it as a weatherproof covering and immediately compressing \nthe straw so that no time is lost, has brought significant time and cost savings to the \nbuilding site, that inevitably makes this a more competitive and viable mainstream \nchoice for construction. \n \nA disadvantage of the load-bearing technique which has been used is how to keep the \nstraw dry throughout the whole building process despite sometimes prolonged wet \nweather of the UK.  Pre-fabrication of building components minimises the vulnerable \ntime of exposure to the weather, and the need to keep the straw waterproofed, can be \nreduced to a few weeks. The floors and roof themselves are used as main weather \nprotection. This was the preferred method for the Waddington houses; the first floor \nand roof were constructed separately, temporarily propped and waterproofed and used \nas shelter for construction to continue below, coupled with sheeted scaffolding \nexternally. As this level of protection is also required for the lime render, it is cost-\neffective to protect the whole building, ensuring there will be no time lost due to the \n 13\nweather for any aspect of the build. Table 1 lists specifications of the main \nconstruction elements with their U-values.  \n \nBenefits of straw construction \nStraw is an annually renewable natural plant product, formed by photosynthesis, \nfuelled by the sun, requiring only small amounts of energy to process. It is a by-\nproduct of grain production and effectively a waste stream although it is currently \nalready used for animal bedding, biofuel and in fabrication of boards for the \nconstruction industry, its potential as an unprocessed building material is currently \nunder explored in the UK.  There has however been an increased interest in the use of \nstraw in mainstream construction over the last 15 years (Lawrence et al., 2009). \nUsing straw as a building material can mean less pressure to use other more \nenvironmentally damaging materials, and if the building is no longer required, it can \nbe re-used in agriculture or even as fuel.  \n \nStraw combines very high insulation properties with load bearing potential. The \nmaximum reported loads for plastered bale walls vary between 21 and 66kN\/m \n(Walker, 2004).  \n \nStraw is a natural and breathable (allowing air exchange through its volume)  \nmaterial, it offers a potential solution for those who find that the paints, chemicals, \nglues, and toxins embedded in manufactured building materials negatively affect their \nhealth. Organically grown straw coated with earth-based and\/or lime plasters have \n 14\nreceived positive feedback from environmentally sensitive people (Magwood et al., \n2005).  As straw is an organic material, it may however carry particular risks if it is \nnot used properly as a building material. To overcome the risks, good design and \nattention to details are required (Lawrence et al., 2009).   \n \nEmbodied carbon assessment \nVerbick and Hens (2010) in a Belgian residential case study illustrate that the total \nembodied energy is relatively small compared to the usage phase and it becomes \nmore valid when comparing the embodied energy of energy saving measures with the \nsavings they realize during 30 years of use. Thormark (2006) in one of the most \nenergy efficient Swedish apartment type housing project shows that during an \nassumed service life of 50 years; operational energy accounts for the majority \n(approximately 85\u201395%) of total energy use. In addition, she also illustrates how \nmaterial choices could influence recycling potential and total embodied energy for the \ntotal building lifetime energy. Adalberth (1997) in a life cycle study of three \nprefabricated and timber framed single dwellings in Sweden shows approximately \n85% and 15% of total life energy consumption occurs during the occupation and \nmanufacturing phases respectively.  In a typical Scottish 3 bedroom semi detached \nhouse Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) case study, Asif et al. (2007) identified that \nconcrete, timber and ceramic tiles are responsible for 61%, 14% and 15% of the total \nembodied energy of the house.   \n \n \n 15\n In the UK wheat is grown for human consumption (milling wheat), animal feed (feed \nwheat) and is also used for fuel by ethanol production or direct combustion \n(industrial). Around 40% of wheat straw produced is chopped and ploughed into the \nfield to improve water retention of farmland, 30% is used on the farm where it was \ngrown for animal bedding and the remainder is sold (Biomass Energy Centre, 2010). \nStraw may be baled at 15-25% moisture content (Biomass Energy Centre, 2010), \ngenerally in large round or square bails and used for animal bedding, burnt as fuel or \nin other manufacturing processes including construction materials. Small square bails \nsuitable for use in wall construction are generally used for domestic pet bedding and \nrepresent a very small part of the straw market, smaller machinery is used for this \ntype of baling reducing some of the fossil fuel impact, but this machinery is not \ngenerally used on larger commercial farms. It is not though that the tractor used \nbiodiesel although this is also a possibility. Wheat straw has been taken here as a by-\nproduct although the straw was baled specifically for the build; the wheat product use \nwas not declared, nor do we know what natural or chemical inputs were administered \nin the growth stage, or the water content of each bale.  \n \nClearly there is a wide range of possibilities in terms of emissions impact which \ncould arise from the LCA of straw used or indeed any biogenic materials used in \nconstruction without a very well documented upstream life cycle information \n(collection of which in both time and cost may be disproportionate to the cost and \ntime of production of the material itself). The methodology which has been used to \ndeal with this uncertainty is to obtain examples both from literature and calculation \n 16\nfrom first principles to obtain a median result used by Hammond and Jones (Bath \nICE, 2006). Inclusion of sequestration in the growth cycle of the product is included \nas a negative value due to the possibility of recycling, use of materials as fuel or \nextending use phase beyond 60 years. The difficulty of predicting end of life \nemissions impact can only be realistically resolved by comparison with current \nnational data on recycling, energy from waste and landfill impacts (Defra, 2009) in \nconjunction with the design life of the building. The approach used here is optimistic \ntowards better end of life management following plan which may be set out by the \narchitect, than a more pessimistic approach which assumes current practice of \ndisposing of demolition waste will be maintained or worsened. \n \nWheat Straw stem consists primarily of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignen. The \ncarbohydrate content of straw may vary due to location, genetic and growth \nconditions (ReTAP, 1997). Examples reported in literature were used to obtain the \nmedian values for cellulose, hemicellulose and lignen of stem dry weight.  Examples \nused include six sets of data reported from literature in ReTAP (ReTAP, 1997), in \naddition to two further sets of data reported by Renewable Energy Institute (1997) \nand Csoka et al. (2008). The median values calculated as percentages of stem dry \nweight for cellulose, hemicellulose and lignen are 36.5%, 28.6% and 17.8% \nrespectively.  The percentage of carbon within cellulose and lignin can be calculated \nfrom their chemical formula, using the relative atomic masses of carbon, hydrogen \nand oxygen as shown in table 2. The percentage of carbon within cellulose and lignin \nis about 44.4% and 66.6% respectively.   \n 17\n \nIf we assume that by the time the bales are used in the construction of buildings their \nmoisture content may be of the order of 10%, the carbon content of straw may \ntherefore be calculated as; \n \n[(0.365 + 0.286)0.444 + 0.178* 0.666]0.9 = 0.367 \n \nTotal carbon dioxide sequestered within the bale can be estimated by multiplying the \ncarbon content of the bale (0.367) by the relative molecular mass of carbon dioxide \n(44g\/molecule) divided by the atomic mass of carbon (12g) (Defra, 2009). This gives \na total carbon dioxide sequestered in the bale of the order of 1.35kg CO2 per kilogram \nof bale.  The calculated sequestration figure is in good agreement with the figure of \n1.36KgCo2\/kg cited by Atkinson (2008). \n \nIn this paper, the benefit is shown separately to allow readers to consider the \nimplications of inclusion of sequestration of CO2 in this form of analysis. For straw a \nfigure of 0.01 kgCO2\/kg has been used for without sequestration (Bath ICE, 2006) \nand a negative figure of 1.35 kgCO2\/kg for with sequestration as calculated above.  \n \nFor timber the figures of 0.45 kgCO2\/kg has been used for without sequestration \n(Bath ICE, 2006).  Similar to straw, timber has a negative foot print if sequestration is \ntaken into account because of carbon dioxide fixed by the original living tree.  \nRagland and Aerts (1991) report that the average carbon content of softwood taken \n 18\nfrom nine species is 52.7%.  Carbon dioxide sequestered within timber is therefore \n1.93 kgCo2 per kilogram of dry wood (0.527*44\/12). As timber is not a by-product, \nthe emissions associated with harvesting, transporting and processing of wood must \nbe taken into account.  Abbott (2008) reports that when energy use for harvesting, \ntransport and processing are taken into account, wood will have a negative cradle to \ngate carbon footprint of 1.2kgC02\/kg.    \n \nThe embodied energy calculation of materials is mainly based on mass of materials, \nso conversion to built quantity is required for the materials used in the construction of \nhouses. The bill of quantities was provided by North Kesteven District Council (the \nclient for the houses) for this study.  As the pair of houses are identical, the embodied \ncarbon dioxide emissions are the same for each. Embodied emissions of building \nelements for both with and without sequestration are presented in Table 3.  The \nmaterials emissions rate for one of  the Waddington houses  without considering the \ncarbon lock in benefits of straw and timber is 151 kgCO2 per square meter of gross \ninternal floor area, much less than an average 475 kgCO2\/m2 for conventionally \nconstructed new build homes in the UK (BHSF, 2008). Biotic materials are capable \nof storing more carbon than they release and to this end if their sequestration potential \nis considered, their embodied impacts might drastically change. If the carbon lock in \nbenefits of straw and timber are taken into account, every square meter of floor area \nof the house will lock in 82.5 kgCO2 during the lifetime of the building.  \n \n \n 19\nEnvironmental Philosophy \nThe design of the houses attempts to fully utilize natural light, ventilation, thermal \nmass and insulation. The U-Value of a typical 450mm thick un-plastered strawbale \nwall is 0.13W\/m2K (Jones, 2009), the thermal conductivity of straw is 0.045W\/mK \nwhich gives a U-Value including plaster of 0.10W\/m2K. UK Building Regulations \nApproved Document part L1A (DCLG, 2006) require that walls should not have U-\nValues greater than 0.30 W\/m2K. A plastered straw wall 450mm thick also has good \nthermal storage capacity of the order of 200340 J\/m2K that evens out temperature \nfluctuations and allows the building to benefit from passive heating from solar gain. \nUK Building Regulations (DCLG, 2006) also stipulate that air leakage must be \nproven to be no worse than 10m3\/hr\/m2 at 50 Pascals (Pa). Atkinson (2008) has \nmeasured an air leakage of 1.56m3\/hr\/m2 at 50 Pascals in a small strawbale holiday \nhome.  Air leakage tests at the Waddington houses show a result of 2.62m\u00b3\/hr\/m at 50 \nPascals .   \n \nAnnually Repeating Impact: Operational carbon dioxide emissions \nOperational life of a building becomes an important factor considering the fact that a \nsignificant impact of building may occur after constructing and installing it (Sodagar \net al., 2009). An efficient operational life could be ensured with high performance \nenvelopes, careful selection of materials, and good services design. The operational \nenergy demands of houses can be calculated using Standard Assessment Procedure \n(BRE, 2005) which utilise standardised regional climatic data. \n 20\n  \nThe space heating of the Waddington houses will be met by a wood burning boiler \nstove with an efficiency of 75% (Dunsley Heat, 2009) and an electrical secondary \nheating panel with an efficiency of 100%. The heating is provided 24 hours \nthroughout the course of the year with a mean internal temperature set point of 19oC.   \nHot water demand is met by the boiler in addition to hot water solar panels (3.52m2) \npositioned on the south facing pitch of the roof.  Table 4 shows the annual energy \nbreakdown requirements and the associated CO2 emissions for the semi-detached \nhouse with the west facing gable wall. The total annual space heating demand of the \nhouse provided by the main and secondary heating systems is 3788 KWh indicating a \nheating demand of the order of 44.2 KWh\/m2 per year. The total annual hot water \ndemand of the house provided by the biomass boiler and the hot water panel is of the \norder of 3946 KWh, consumption of the order of 46 KWh\/m2.  As buildings become \nmore energy efficient in space heating with increased insulation levels and better air \ntightness, the relative contribution of hot water and household electricity to the total \nenergy demand of the house will become more significant. This is especially the case \nfor small dwellings which usually have a greater energy use for water and electricity \nper unit of floor area (Gustavsson and Joelsson, 2010). \n \nThe annual heating demand of the house with an east facing gable wall is fractionally \nhigher due to the orientation of the end walls. The house with west facing gable wall \nis equipped with monitoring devices and will be subject to post occupancy \n 21\nevaluations in future, and to this end, this paper concentrates on analysing the design \nresults for this house.  \n \nTypically the energy demand of modern family homes in the UK for heating and hot \nwater is 21,500 kWh, and for lighting and small power is 4,000 kWh (Rawlinson, \n2007). The total heating and hot water demands of the Waddington house is 7734 \nkWh per year including the hot water supplied by the hot water panels. Whilst this \nrepresents a 64% reduction, in order to achieve highest Codes for Sustainable Homes \nstandards (DCLG, 2008), the Waddington house would require a heat recovery \nsystem. The compact and open plan layout of the house should allow convective heat \nmovement to perform this function. Monitoring in use will help to demonstrate that \nconvection is an effective alternative to mechanical recovery. To estimate CO2 \nemissions the conversion factors used are 0.025 kgCO2\/kWh and 0.442 kgCO2\/kWh \nfor wood and electricity respectively (BRE, 2005) as shown in Table 4. Standard \nAssessment Procedure (SAP) (BRE, 2005) uses delivered energy for calculating \noperational CO2 emissions from residential buildings. Reducing dependence on mains \nelectricity in UK housing through small power and lighting load reduction and micro \ngeneration is an effective way to reduce CO2 emissions as the national grid remains \nhighly dependent on fossil fuels. \n \nWhole Life Impact \nLife cycle assessment (LCA) is a key approach to analyse the whole life impact of a \nbuilding as it allows for the estimation of impacts distribution across all the life cycle \n 22\nstages by integrating upstream and downstream material and energy flows (Rai, et al \n2010). Many varieties of tools (for e.g. LCA based tools, rating systems, technical \nguidelines, etc.) have been developed for the building sector to support decision \nmaking and improve environmental performance of buildings and building stocks \n(Haapio and Viitaniemi 2008). In a French study, Peuportier (2001) with the help of \nthe simulation tool EQUER (French for the evaluation of environmental quality of \nbuildings) compared the LCA of two wooden framed houses with a typical reference \nhouse (concrete block wall) with the design life of 80 years. The simulation tool \nEQUER is based upon a building model structured in objects making the comparison \nof design alternatives easier (Peuportier, 2001). The study emphasized the importance \nof LCA decision-making tools at design stage. There are many datasets and tools \navailable to assess the embodied impacts of building materials but often their \napplication are limited to user\u2019s goals, scope and geographical location. Scheuer el al. \n(2003) in a university building study asserted that because of continuing data \nlimitations, and due to the large range of construction techniques and material \nchoices, many of the available tools are currently not capable of modeling an entire \nbuilding, or computing the environmental impacts from all life cycle phases and \nprocesses.  Bath dataset (Bath ICE, 2006) was chosen for this study as it offers a \ndataset well suited for assessing embodied carbon data of conventional building \nmaterials in the UK.  \n   \nCalculating emissions from the construction process is a relatively new concern for \nthe construction industry and published sources are limited (Sodagar and Fieldson, \n 23\n2008). The contractor of the Waddington houses was not required to record emissions \nimpact of the construction process and in absence of data, we have assumed that the \nimpact of the construction process is to be of the order of 5% of the material \nproduction energy (Gustavsson et al., 2010) reflecting the scale of the project and the \nfact that local contractors and labour force are used in the construction of houses.  A \nfigure of 5% waste for all materials is assumed for the Waddington houses as \nsuggested by Gustavsson et al. (2010) considering the recovery of wood waste (and \nstraw) for use as a substitute for fossil fuel.  \n \nThe energy used for demolition of buildings is typically small (1-3%) in relation to \nthe energy used for material production and building assembly (Gustavsson et al., \n2010).  In our analysis, we have assumed that the deconstruction impact of the houses \nwill equal to 1% of the combined impacts of materials and construction process. \nConsideration of end of life impact of straw and timber is further complicated by the \nuncertainty associated with how long buildings will be utilised beyond the design life \nassumed and the manner in which the materials will be disposed of. Currently in the \nUK diversion from landfill of renewable materials from demolition does readily take \nplace but published rates lag behind current practice (ERM, 2006) and almost \ncertainly will not represent a UK scenario in the future where energy from waste is \nanticipated to be widespread.  \n \nTable 5 lists the emissions for the semi-detached house with west facing gable wall \nover 60 years for different lifecycle stages. The whole life CO2 emissions of the semi-\n 24\ndetached Waddington house over 60 years design life is 51761.4 kgCO2 if the storage \ncarbon potential of materials is excluded. The in-use emissions are 72.2% of the total \nlifetime CO2 emissions of the house. With sequestration, the total emissions of \nbuilding elements will be -7070 kgCO2 instead of 12952 kgCO2 thus reducing the \nwhole life CO2 emissions of the house to 31739.4 kgCO2. In this case, the carbon \nstorage potential of straw and wood has negated the impacts of other stages of LCA \nand offers a 61% saving over the lifetime of the building compared with the case \nwithout sequestration providing that the renewable materials are disposed of in the \nmost resource and fuel efficient way at the end of life.  \n \nWe cannot know what will happen at the end of life of Waddington house, and \nexamples of redundant buildings in the UK left to decompose, allowing stored carbon \nfrom renewable elements to be released as if the materials were in landfill are \ncommon. In our analysis we have estimated that 15647 kilograms of CO2 is stored in \neach of Waddington houses of which 6079 kilograms of CO2 is sequestered by straw \nand the remaining by wood and wood products used in the construction of the house.  \nThis is arguably as valuable in terms of climate change and global emissions \nreduction as are the benefits of further reducing the operational emissions of the \nbuilding by better design over 60 years of use which in the UK climatic and national \ngrid conditions has yet to be proven  realistic.   \n \n \n \n 25\nAlternative Walling Systems \nIn order to compare the whole life performance of strawbale construction with more \nconventional house walling systems used in the UK, four alternative external walls \nwere considered. The specifications for alternative external walling systems \ncommensurate with present-day good practice low energy design in the UK.  In \naddition to alternative external walling systems, two alternative party walls were also \nconsidered to represent the common practice for the party walls used in the UK \nmeeting Building Control requirements for fire safety and noise transfer between \ndwellings.  \n \nAll four external walls have the same U-value as that of the strawbale walls, i.e. 0.10 \nW\/m2K. The standard of air tightness was also assumed to be the same as for the \nhouse with strawbale walls, i.e. an air leakage index of 2.62m3\/hr\/m2 at a reference \npressure of 50 Pascals.  Table 6 lists the specifications of alternative external and \nparty walling systems.  Table 7 lists CO2 emissions rates and costs for different \nwalling systems. The estimated costs account for labour, plant and materials although \nthey exclude prelims such as scaffold. For the external walling, strawbale is the most \neconomic option. The other two party walls however are cheaper to construct when \ncompared with strawbale party wall.  All other elements of the houses such as \nwindows and roof were considered to be the same. Although all other construction \nelements are the same in all different scenarios, it was necessary to strengthen the \nfoundations with extra limecrete for cases having the rendered and brick faced \n 26\nmasonry walls due to greater weights of these walls compared with strawbale wall, \nand timber frame construction.  \n \nTable 8 compares the total house materials CO2 emissions of the house with different \nexternal walling systems and party walls. Total impacts of materials for different \ncases are depicted in Figure 9. The house with strawbale walls out performs all \nalternative walling systems both with and without sequestration. When the carbon \nstorage potential of materials is considered, the difference between strawbale and all \nother options becomes more significant due to the quantity of straw used and \nconsequently the amount of carbon stored.   \n \nMore highly processed masonry elements increase the impact of the other walling \noptions.  The total house material impacts with different walling systems range from \n12952 kgCO2 for strawbale, to 18940 kgCO2 for the house with brick faced masonry \nwalling system, showing that 5988 kilograms of CO2 is saved by using renewable \nmaterials even with excluding sequestration. With sequestration, the maximum \nsavings achieved is 12105 kilograms of CO2 as a result of using strawbale compared \nwith the case with brick faced masonry walls. It should be noted that infrastructure, \nfoundation and flooring design at Waddington is not conventional and therefore the \nbenchmark offered for UK residential construction (BHSF, 2006) is quite high.  \n \nTable 9 compares the whole life impact of houses with different walling systems over  \n 27\ntheir assumed life expectancy of 60 years. The impacts from construction process, \nmaterials waste and deconstruction, as a percentage of the corresponding materials \nimpacts were assumed to be the same for all cases. For all cases we have assumed \nthat the impact of construction process and materials waste is 5% each of the \ncorresponding materials impacts (without sequestration). The deconstruction impact \nis assumed to be equal to 1% of the combined impacts of the relative materials and \nconstruction process. \n \nThe effect of changing the walling systems on operational energy demands were also \nanalysed using SAP (BRE, 2005).  The calculated whole life impacts range from \n603.6 kgCO2\/m2 to 681.2 kgCO2\/m2 and 370.1 kgCO2\/m2 to 519 kgCO2\/m2 of \ninternal floor area for without and with sequestration respectively. The house with \nstrawbale walls outperforms all of the conventional walling systems. \n \nConclusions  \nThis paper has taken a standpoint of aiming to demonstrate the viability and \nperformance benefits of strawbale housing for rural communities. Straw walling \nclearly offers a low embodied and operational emissions performance and is equally \nsuitable as a walling material as more conventional options. Although not proven to \nbe lower cost in mass housing, the market has not been fully tested at larger scale \ndevelopment level and authors expect that the learning gained in this pilot project and \nthe elemental cost comparison for demonstrating alternative walling systems will lead \nto more economic strawbale construction in the near future. There are other issues to \n 28\nconsider if straw were to become a more common building material and diverted \nfrom existing uses. Low straw yield years in the UK due to variable weather \nconditions, rate of uptake of organic methods and resulting availability would \nincrease the emissions impact of transportation of straw on a project by project basis, \nand certainly influence cost based decisions.  \n \nMonitoring will be required to prove claims of reduced emissions due to the design of \nthe houses and servicing; and it would be expected that future residents and the local \nauthority will be sufficiently satisfied to endorse this approach in meeting housing \nneeds in rural areas.  \n \nOne of the key areas of significance provided in the paper is the variation in results \nwhen LCA boundaries are changed by including carbon sequestration potential of \nbiotic materials. The paper estimates that the total emissions of building elements per \ndwelling are of the order of 13 tonnes of CO2 without sequestration. By considering \nthe carbon lock-up potential of straw, wood and wood products, each dwelling may \nbe considered as a carbon sink negating the impacts of non renewable materials \nresulting in locking up around 7 tonnes of CO2.  \n \nFurther research is required to fully support the use of sequestration in embodied \nimpact assessment with end of life implications, particularly where this approach is \nused to compare very different material options in other construction sectors. It is \nclear that considerable savings in emissions may be achieved by selecting low carbon \n 29\nand renewable materials, however any carbon lock in claims must be based on clear \nprinciples and planning for deconstruction to ensure that the stored benefit is not later \nlost.  \n \nThe most significant assertion made here is that the effective management of stored \ncarbon held in renewable materials both entering and being released from building \nstock as demolition waste may represent a comparable UK wide CO2 emissions \nsaving to the improvements which may be gained from adopting the very highest \nlevels of operational performance in the Code for Sustainable Homes. Whilst this \npaper did not set out to demonstrate the case for sequestration and deconstruction \ncontrol to retain the value of stored carbon, it is clear that a growing preference for \nusing natural materials in order to claim the benefit of stored emissions will provide \nan increasingly energy rich source of materials in demolition waste in future years. \n \n 30\n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would wish to thank Ian Spreadborough and Luke Sims of North \nKesteven District Council for providing the bill of quantities for the houses.
