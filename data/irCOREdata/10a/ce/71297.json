Until \u0081\u0088\u0083\u0086, many of England\u2019s lighthouses were privately owned.

This process of reform\ngives an insight into the limits contemporaries believed should be placed on\nprivate property, and indicates that, even in an industrializing, expanding\neconomy, private profit was not always seen as desirable : some services, it was\nheld, should be non-profit making. Private profit from lighthouses came under\nattack as it was understood to be a result of \u2018old corruption\u2019, and also because\nit was thought to be against the public interest. The way in which this interest\nwas defined \u2013 primarily in economic rather than \u2018safety at sea\u2019 terms, and\ncharacterized by a blending of a narrow business interest with notions of a\nbroader national interest \u2013 reveals much about the nature of the reform. The\npublic interest was violated when profit was made by those who did not\ncontribute to the trade of the country at the expense of those who did. To\neliminate these failings, the demand grew that lighthouses should be centralized\nunder a single public authority. Public ownership would eliminate profit and\nsurplus collection, and centralization would lead to economies in the costs of\nmanagement. The state and Trinity House had caused the problem by\ngranting rights to levy light dues to individuals, but both came to be seen as the\nsolution to the problem: the state was the only agency capable of redefining\nproperty rights and redistributing property from private to public control ;\nTrinity House was considered the most responsible and efficient public body to\nmanage the English lights. By the 1830s, both bodies had come to be viewed as\ncapable of defending the public interest against corrupt forms of private\nproperty. The transferral of property rights involved amounted to a\nnationalization of the private lighthouses, but reform stopped short of the\ncreation of a lighthouse authority for the United Kingdom, due to the refusal\nof Scottish and Irish MPs to contemplate the swallowing up of their boards by\nan, as they believed, inferior English one.\nThis appropriation of private property raises important questions about the\nrole of the state in nineteenth-century Britain. It is best viewed alongside other\ninstances where post-1815 and particularly post-1830 governments used state\npower in order to reform varieties of private property which had come to be\nseen as corrupt or antithetical to the public interest.

In 1829 the Quarterly\nReview celebrated Britain\u2019s international pre-eminence, but warned against\nassuming that the \u2018progress of improvement\u2019 was inevitable :\nIf we are to keep our place \u2026 it is indispensably necessary that every incumbrance\nshould be removed which clogs the activity and energy of individuals or the government.\nEvery part of the machine of society must be adapted to the increased exertion it is\ncalled upon to make. If this be so, every branch of our public and private economy; \u2013 the\nadministration of the affairs of parishes and counties ; \u2013 the state of charities,\ncorporations, public schools, colleges, the law, the church, and the whole management\nof our foreign dependencies, must successively submit to examination and amendment.\nWealthy as the country is, and attached to ancient institutions as it has always been, it\ncan no longer support the burden of places or proceedings which can be simplified or\ndispensed with.*\nWhile \u2018ancient institutions \u2019 had their supporters,\"! there was a widespread\nperception that old forms of property were in danger of holding back\n\u2018 improvement\u2019. George Poulett Scrope, a whig writing in the tory Quarterly,\nmade the case for interference in property rights, insisting that \u2018 there is a limit\nto the principle of legalized appropriation\u2019, which was reflected in many of the\nnation\u2019s laws. Direct interferences with the right of private property were\n\u2018 sanctioned by their conducing to the general welfare, which is itself the only\nfoundation of that right \u2019. Scrope argued that the right of property was\ntherefore a limited rather than an absolute one. The problem he posed was\n\u2018what are its just limits? \u2019\"\" Determining where private rights ended and public\nrights began was a key political issue in this period.

This process was driven by demands from taxpayers for\neconomical reform in reaction to the big, obtrusive, heavily taxing government\nthat had emerged during the wars with France.\"# The public interest was\ntherefore most commonly defined in this period as what was cheapest. This was\nthe case with reform of the poor laws, as it was with the lighthouses. Crucially,\nin both cases centralization was seen as the best way to secure a reduction of the\nburden on the public. The choice of centralizing authority was also important :\nwith the poor laws and lighthouses alike, the aim was \u2018public \u2019 control in order\nto secure retrenchment, but at one remove from central government.\nI\nPolitical economists in the nineteenth century did not give lighthouses much\nthought, beyond assuming that they were the proper responsibility of\ngovernment.\"$ This was regarded as indisputable and common sense. For\nexample, J. R. McCulloch wrote that \u2018No one doubts the propriety of\n[government] interfering to render navigation secure, and to obviate the\nchances of shipwreck, by enacting regulations as to lighthouses, pilotage, &c. \u2019\"%\nJohn Stuart Mill later held in his Principles of political economy that \u2018 it is a proper\noffice of government to build and maintain lighthouses, establish buoys, etc. for\nthe security of navigation\u2019.\"& McCulloch and Mill appear not to have realized\nthat private ownership of lights had existed for centuries in England before it\nwas abolished in the 1830s. To understand the complexity of the concept of\nprivate property in lighthouses, a brief survey of the history of lighthouses is\nessential.\nSuch lighthouses as existed in medieval England were privately owned.\nThose desirous of constructing a lighthouse would arrange for the dispatch of\na petition to the crown from local merchants and shipowners, which had to\ninclude a demonstration of willingness to pay light dues to cover the cost of\nerection and maintenance. If the crown consented to the request, letters patent\nwere granted to the individual nominated in the petition, permitting the levy\nof light dues to cover construction costs, and the lighthouse could be erected.\nThese dues were collected by private agents working on behalf of the lighthouse\n\"# Elie Hale! vy, A history of the English people, \u0081\u0088\u0081\u0085\u2013\u0081\u0088\u0083\u0080 (London, 1926), pp. 116\u201323, 194\u2013201 ;\nDavid Roberts, Victorian origins of the British welfare state (New Haven, 1960), p. 35 ; Philip Harling\nand Peter Mandler, \u2018From \u2018\u2018fiscal-military \u2019\u2019 state to laissez-faire state, 1760\u20131850 \u2019, Journal of\nBritish Studies, 32 (1993), pp. 44\u201370 ; Philip Harling, The waning of old corruption: the politics of\neconomical reform in Britain, \u0081\u0087\u0087\u0089\u2013\u0081\u0088\u0084\u0086 (Oxford, 1996), pp. 136\u201396.\n\"$ This was first noted by Coase, \u2018The lighthouse in economics \u2019, pp. 357\u201360.\n\"% J.

The level of\ndues payable was decided by the tonnage of the ship, and there were different\nrates for vessels engaged in the coasting trade, in overseas trade, and for foreign\nvessels. Rates were fixed with the granting of letters patent and could not be\naltered. As trade expanded in the Elizabethan period, however, even when the\nrates were fixed at a relatively low level, the large volume of trade taxed meant\nthat lighthouses became lucrative possessions. Speculators became involved,\nand there was strong competition for the rights to erect lights. The grant of\nthese rights became an important form of crown patronage.\"\u2019\nPrivate ownership of lighthouses was ended in 1836, but it might have ceased\nmuch earlier than this were it not for the initial disinclination of Trinity House,\nwhich after 1836 controlled all lighthouses in England, to invest in lighthouses :\nit was this reluctance which made the existence of private lighthouses on a large\nscale possible. Trinity House of Deptford Strond was a seamen\u2019s guild which\nhad been incorporated in 1514 by Henry VIII. It had traditionally dispensed\nalms to retired or destitute seamen and their dependants, and as such was\nsimilar to guilds in other places such as Hull, York, and Newcastle.\"( While the\nguilds at Newcastle and Hull were also incorporated as Trinity Houses during\nHenryVIII\u2019s reign, the TrinityHouse at Deptford accumulatedmore extensive\npowers through the sixteenth century, including the regulation of pilotage, and\nthe provision and regulation of navigational aids on land and at sea, setting it\napart from the other corporations. These powers made it the logical body to\nprovide lighthouses, but it largely left this function to private enterprise, and\neven opposed private construction of lights.\") By the 1690s, as the value of\nlighthouses to shipping became undeniable, the corporation\u2019s attitude to\nlighthouses softened, but it was still unwilling to take on construction itself.\nInstead, when demand for a lighthouse in a particular spot was sufficiently\nhigh, Trinity House itself applied for a patent from the crown, then leased the\nrights to the light for a long fixed period to a private individual, who\nconstructed the lighthouse with his own money and, paying an annual rent to\nTrinity House, kept all the profits from light dues for himself.\nThus private ownership of lights was perpetuated. A decisive change in\npolicy came much later, towards the end of the eighteenth century.\nIndustrialization and the consequent expansion of trade, combined with the\ndevelopment of the more reliable argand lamp in the 1780s, meant that\nlighthouses had become more profitable and low risk to their owners, and\nuseful to shipping, than ever before. Trinity House was fully aware of these\n\"\u2019 G. G.

As the leases previously distributed began to run out, rather\nthan renewing them, Trinity House took on the lighthouses itself. It also started\nconstruction of lights on a scale it had never before undertaken. The change in\npolicy was probably due more to self-interest than public spiritedness, but the\nresult was a transformation of the lighthouse infrastructure : by 1820, twenty-\nfive lighthouses were controlled by Trinity House, leaving twenty-two still in\nprivate hands.\"* These private lights are indicated on Map 1.\n\"* Trinity House also possessed eight floating lights making a total of thirty-three public general\nlights under its control.\nlighthouses , property , and the state 755\nAs a result of this complicated history, there were three types of private\nownership of lighthouses. First were those lights which had been leased to\nprivate individuals by the crown in the seventeenth century, during Trinity\nHouse\u2019s period of inactivity. Second were lights which had been granted to\nindividuals in perpetuity by acts of parliament in the same period. Third were\nthe lights which had been leased to individuals by Trinity House in the\neighteenth century, and which had not yet reverted to the corporation.\nFurthermore, the Scottish and Irish lights were operated under different\nsystems. Every lighthouse in Scotland was controlled by the commissioners of\nnorthern lights, a public body set up by an act of 1786. There were twenty-five\ncommissioners, who included the lord advocate and solicitor general for\nScotland, and provosts of the main cities and county sheriffs.#! All Scottish\nlights were established after 1786 and had thus always been under the control\nof the commissioners. In Ireland, however, the lights had been under various\nauthorities including the commissioners of customs until an 1810 act vested\nthem in the ballast board of Dublin, created by an act of incorporation in 1786\nfor improving the port of Dublin. It had twenty-three members, including the\nlord mayor and sheriffs of Dublin, three aldermen, with the rest of the board\nmade up of merchants, bankers, and other members of the corporation of the\ncity of Dublin.#\"\nTrinity House had a very different constitution. It was made up of thirty-one\nelder brethren: of these, eleven were honorary members \u2013 naval men, MPs and\nothers \u2013 who had little or no influence on the policy of Trinity House, and the\nremaining twenty, who were in charge of the corporation\u2019s business, were\nretired shipowners from the merchant service. The brethren formed themselves\ninto seven committees each dealing with an aspect of Trinity House\u2019s duties.\nThe committee for lights consisted of three members, each serving for three\nyears.## While there were no private lights in either Ireland or Scotland,\ncomplications of a different nature arose due to the fact that both authorities\noperated very different systems of charges from Trinity House, which levied\nfixed rates on each light passed. In Scotland the commissioners charged for the\nfirst light passed, but there was no extra charge for making use of further lights.\nThe Irish lights, on the other hand, were maintained by a tonnage duty levied\non all ships entering Irish ports, which had to be paid even if a ship had not\npassed a single light.\nShipowners and merchants found this mixed economy of private lights and\nmultiple public authorities highly unsatisfactory. After 1815, despite the\ndepression, most lighthouses were still generating large surpluses. Trinity\nHouse\u2019s income from lights after collection costs was \u00a351,951 in 1815.#$ In\n#!

The economic difficulties of British business inspired\nthe appointment in 1820 of a select committee to consider \u2018means of improving\nand maintaining the foreign trade of the country\u2019.#( The committee was given\nsuch a broad brief that it reported to parliament frequently over the next four\nyears on a variety of subjects, regularly finding in favour of freer trade. One of\nthe committee\u2019s reports was dedicated to the subject of lights, harbour dues,\nand pilotage.\nThe committee recognized the \u2018various burdens that appeared to press upon\nthe navigation of this country\u2019, and saw reduction of charges on shipping,\nincluding light dues, as an \u2018 indispensable preliminary\u2019 to the expansion of the\nforeign commerce of the country.#) Lighthouse charges were so heavy due to\nthe expansion of trade since the times when the rate of dues were fixed, and also\nbecause of lack of uniformity in the lighthouse system: private ownership of\nlights led to inefficiency in management, high collection costs, and wide\nvariation in charges for lights. It was argued that surplus collection was\ncontrary to the purposes for which dues had been originally permitted, namely\nto build and maintain the lights, and this afforded \u2018a fair claim to relief \u2019 on the\npart of the commercial interests.#* The increased volume of trade taxed had\nalso inflated Trinity House\u2019s charitable fund beyond original intentions. The\nnumber of pensioners relieved in 1815, 7,012, had almost doubled since 1800,\nand over this period \u00a311,930 was added to the annual pension list. In 1815,\n\u00a323,134 was being spent on pensioners, and the figure was still rising.$! The\ncommittee recommended that the fund be subjected to a \u2018progressive\nreduction\u2019 (as mariners died, new ones were not to be placed on the books, until\npayments had fallen to around \u00a313,000), which would create a surplus to\nenable Trinity House both to cut dues and buy out private owners.$\" In\naddition, the government should refuse to renew the leases of the lights issued\nby the crown which were due to expire in the 1820s, and instead transfer them\n#% SC appointed to consider means of maintaining and improving the foreign trade of the country, as far as\nrelates to lights, harbour dues, and pilotage (PP, 1822, v), pp. 340\u20133, 394. #& Ibid., pp. 340\u20133.\n#\u2019 House of Commons Journals, 76, p. 100, 22 Feb. 1821 ; ibid., 77, pp. 230\u20131, 3 May 1822.\n#( PP, 1820, ii. #) SC \u2026 [on] foreign trade (PP, 1822, v), p. 3. #* Ibid., p. 8.\n$!

In this way, the aims of economy, uniformity, and\ncentralization would be realized.\nThe government responded to some, but not all, of the committee\u2019s\nrecommendations. The year 1822 saw the passing of a local act enabling\nTrinity House to reduce dues, and to enter into negotiations with private\noperators with the aim of purchasing their leases, using its own funds.$#\nCrucially, the act did not oblige private owners to sell : it merely permitted\nTrinity House to offer to purchase their rights. Three sets of lights were\nobtained under this act by Trinity House in the 1820s.$$ The corporation also\ninitiated a major programme of toll reduction in the 1820s : this was made\npossible by the revenues it obtained from the lights it was purchasing, from the\nlights whose leases had expired and therefore reverted to Trinity House, and\nfrom the new lights it was building. In 1820, Trinity House controlled twenty-\nfive lighthouses and eight lightships, a total of thirty-three, while by 1832, this\nhad increased to forty-two lighthouses and thirteen floating lights, a total of\nfifty-five, twenty-two more than just twelve years previously. Table 1\ndemonstrates the extent to which Trinity House was able to reduce the tolls it\ncharged.\nTrinity House also proved its willingness to make sacrifices for the greater\ngood in 1823 when it waived the payments it was entitled to arising from the\ngovernment\u2019s reciprocity treaties with other nations.

In 1832,\n\u00a323,859 was paid out in this way, \u00a312,857 of this for light dues, including\n\u00a31,406 to the commissioners of the northern lights, \u00a34,301 to the ballast board,\nand \u00a35,993 to private owners of lighthouses. Trinity House, on the other hand,\nreduced the rates on foreign vessels without charge to the consolidated customs\nas part of its programme of toll reduction.$& In this way, Trinity House joined\nwith the state in sacrificing revenue in order to strengthen the position of British\nmerchants, considering this to be in the public interest.\nBut in several important respects, the changes fell short of the hopes of the\nreformers and the shipowners. First, it was clear that permissive powers were\nnot sufficient to bring an end to private ownership of lighthouses. The lessees of\nthe Smalls light, whose lease still had over fifty years to run, agreed to sell, but\nonly on terms considered extortionate by the elder brethren, who declined to\nbuy, while one of the lessees of the Longships light refused even to enter\nnegotiations.$\u2019 Worse, ignoring the recommendations of the 1822 select\ncommittee, the lords of the Treasury in 1828 and 1829 renewed for a further\ntwenty-one years the expired leases of six private lights \u2013 at Dungeness,\nHarwich, Winterton, and Orfordness \u2013 rather than hand them over to Trinity\nHouse. The terms were renegotiated to favour shipping, with the dues to be\nlevied on four of the lights halved. But the revised terms also benefited the\ncrown: the new leases gave the commissioners of woods and forests half of the\nprofits from four lights and 60 per cent from the other two, arrangements which\nby the mid-1830s had netted the commissioners \u00a396,843.$( Despite the reduced\ntolls, it seemed to reformers that the twin aims of centralization and economy\nhad been sacrificed for the revenues of the crown. By 1835, there were still ten\nprivate lighthouse establishments in England exhibiting thirteen lights. In\naddition, the pension fund of Trinity House remained untouched by reform: in\n1820, Trinity House\u2019s expenditure on pensioners was \u00a332,035 ; in 1832, it was\n\u00a332,861.$)\nLight dues therefore remained a controversial subject in the 1830s. An 1833\nselect committee on the state of manufactures, commerce, and shipping gave\nshipowners and merchants an opportunity to air their grievances at a time\nwhen, one shipowner and merchant claimed, rates of freight were \u2018very much\nlower than they have ever been at any former period\u2019.$* The testimonies of a\nnumber of witnesses showed that light dues were still resented.%!

He successfully presented reduction of light dues as a means\nof soothing shipowners\u2019 resentment of the relaxation of the navigation laws in\nthe 1820s and furthering retrenchment. The government had a duty to act\nnow when so many complaints were daily made of the distress felt by the shipping\ninterest \u2026 whether that class was distressed or not, he considered that where an annual\nexpense of nearly 200,000l. was incurred on lighthouses alone, it behoved Government\nnot to pass it over without inquiry, and without giving every possible relief to the\nshipping interest.%\"\nLater in parliament, Hume was even more explicit in selling lighthouse\nreform as a quid pro quo for the earlier reform of the navigation laws:\nit was surprising that while the shipping interests in the country were complaining of the\ndistress which they stated they suffered from the competition with foreign ships, no steps\nshould have been taken by the Government of the country to relieve them from the\nexactions to which they were so long exposed by the [light] tolls.%#\nHume\u2019s line of attack focused very much on private ownership of lighthouses\nand the resultant high dues. By contrast, the shipowners before the 1833 select\ncommittee on manufactures, commerce, and shipping had not mentioned\nprivate lights, but instead complained of the high rates in general. The absence\nof criticism of private ownership in 1833 may have been due to widespread\nignorance of the details of the ownership and administration of lighthouses.\nThis is suggested by two articles on lighthouse reform written by David\nBrewster which appeared in the Edinburgh Review.%$ The first, in April 1833,\nconcentrated on the deficiencies of the three lighthouse boards and the\ninefficiencies deriving from a multiplicity of authorities. But the second,\npublished in April 1835, singled out private ownership as the main abuse,\nadmitting that before the report of Hume\u2019s committee, \u2018[t]he nature of our\nlighthouse system had been long concealed from general observation, and the\nbest informed of our public characters were entirely ignorant of its rules and its\npractices \u2019.%%\nIn February 1833, Hume moved for returns to be made of the gross and net\nrevenues collected by private lighthouses since 1822, and the accounts of\nTrinity House, material which was used in the select committee on lighthouses\nchaired by Hume the following year. Table 2 summarizes these returns, which\nwere used to indict private ownership as they highlighted the enormous gap\nwhich had opened up by 1832 between the rates charged by private lights on\none hand, and public lights on the other.

The\nreport endorsed the principle that light dues should be reduced to the\nminimum amount required to maintain existing lights and construct whatever\nnew lights were required by shipping. Toll reduction being the committee\u2019s\nprincipal aim, diversity of management and private dues were the two\ngrievances given the most stress. The committee\u2019s report was unequivocally\nhostile to any continuation of private ownership, and reported that it was \u2018a\nmatter of reproach\u2019 to the nation that \u2018a considerable portion of the\nestablishments of lighthouses have been made the means of heavily taxing the\ntrade of the country, for the benefit of a few private individuals, who have been\nfavoured with that advantage by the ministers and the Sovereign of the day\u2019.%&\nHume wanted the private lights along with all other lights to be placed under\na new public board, but he was outmanoeuvred by the sheer size of the\ncommittee,%\u2019 and was outvoted: a majority argued that Trinity House was a\nsuitable public body.%( All private lights were to be transferred \u2018without delay\u2019\nto Trinity House; the owners were to have no say in the matter, and\ncompensation was to be paid out of Trinity House\u2019s reserves and the money\nobtained by the commissioners of woods and forests from the renewal of the\nleases in the 1820s, the balance to be made up by an advance from the\nTreasury.%) This would achieve uniformity and centralization of management\nfor the English lights, but the committee went further : it wanted uniformity\nthroughout the United Kingdom.%* The large surpluses levied by the Scottish\nand Irish lighthouse authorities were criticized, and the committee proposed\nthat their lights should all be placed under the control of Trinity House in order\nto secure economy in collection and administration, and to facilitate rapid\n%& SC \u2026 [on] lighthouses (PP, 1834, xii), p. 4.\n%\u2019 The committee had forty-three members.\n%( Hansard, 3rd ser., xxxi, 167 (8 Feb. 1836).\n%) SC \u2026 [on] lighthouses (PP, 1834, xii), p. 56. %* Ibid., p. 23.\nlighthouses , property , and the state 761\nreduction of dues. Finally, the committee urged the winding up of Trinity\nHouse\u2019s charitable functions, to be achieved by no longer adding any new\nnames to the pension lists, thus allowing dues to be further reduced by natural\nwastage.\nIn March 1835 Hume initiated a debate in the Commons on the report, and\nobtained leave to bring in a private bill based on its findings.&! The bill\nprovoked much opposition, mostly from Irish and Scottish members who did\nnot want their lighthouse authorities to be abolished in favour of an English\nboard, and lacking government support, the bill failed.&\" Complaining in\nFebruary the following year that the government appeared unwilling to pursue\nlighthouse reform, Hume brought in another bill, this time leaving out of\nconsideration the Scottish and Irish lights, and concentrating on the cessation\nof private ownership in England, and the abolition of Trinity House\u2019s pension\nfund. Charles Poulett Thomson, the whig president of the board of trade,\ninduced Hume to drop his bill on the promise that the government would\nintroduce a similar one of its own, and this government bill, which left Trinity\nHouse\u2019s charitable fund intact, became law the same year.&# The ten remaining\nsets of private lighthouses were taken from their owners, who received\ncompensation totalling \u00a31,182,546.&$\nII\nLighthouses pose a problem for those desirous of competition at all levels of the\neconomy as they are inherently monopolistic : the idea of competing lighthouses\nis plainly absurd. It was the status of the private lights as local private\nmonopolies which precipitated reform, as these monopolies were considered to\nbe injurious to the \u2018public \u2019 interest. What made these private monopolies even\nmore objectionable was that they had been created by the state (and by Trinity\nHouse). Thus it is possible to view the case of lighthouse reform in terms of the\nbroader struggle against \u2018old corruption\u2019 and state patronage. For Hume,\nprivate ownership \u2018constituted one system of jobbing and plunder\u2019.&% The\nConservative MP George Robinson (also, incidentally, a merchant and\nshipowner) claimed that \u2018under all governments, the lighthouse system had\nbeen made one of gross jobbing\u2019.&& David Brewster condemned a system which\nallowed individuals to tax commerce for private benefit : \u2018 it is in England only,\namong all the civilised communities upon earth, that such acts of monstrous\n&!

These renewals, against the explicit recommendations of the\n1822 select committee, not only perpetuated private ownership, but meant that\nthe government (specifically the commissioners of woods and forests) now\nbenefited economically from these private monopolies, at the expense of the\ncommunity. This situation provoked a typically robust condemnation from\nHume, who declared the renewals \u2018 little short of high treason \u2026 If ever there\nwas a case calling for the impeachment of a Ministry, this was such a case. \u2019&(\nSir Robert Peel strenuously denied accusations of corruption,&) but the\nrenewals proved a handy stick with which to beat the tories. Poulett Thomson\nskilfully distanced his party from the policy previously pursued by the tories : he\n\u2018could only say, that the renewals had not been granted by the administration\nof which he had the honour to form a part ; and he had always maintained that\nthese advantages ought not to have been conceded\u2019.&* Attention was drawn in\nparliament to the whigs \u2019 exemplary behaviour in transferring control of the\nForeland lights from Greenwich Hospital to Trinity House when the former\u2019s\nlease expired in July 1832, thus facilitating an instant quartering of dues.\nInterestingly, less was made of the same government\u2019s renewal of the private\nlease on the Hunstanton lighthouse in February the same year on terms\nremarkably similar to the controversial renewals of the 1820s, an action which\nwould appear to indicate that the whigs were not wholly convinced in 1832\nthat centralization was the right course.\u2019! Nevertheless, lighthouse reform\nenabled the whigs and radicals to pose as crusaders against local monopolies\nwhich the tories sought to perpetuate. By the early 1830s, the tories \u2019 stance on\nthe issue was sufficiently unpopular for Peel to break with previous party policy\nand support lighthouse centralization.\u2019\"\nPrivate ownership of lighthouses, though tainted with old corruption, was\nnot criticized solely because it had arisen through government patronage: it\nwas attacked more fundamentally because private property in lighthouses was\nheld to be morally wrong and antithetical to the interests of society. The\nmorality of reform was expressed in terms of the \u2018public \u2019 interest. The\ndefinition of this public interest was crucial to the success of lighthouse reform.\nArguments used to justify reform sometimes touched on the issue of safety:\nshipwrecks were thought to be due in part to the inadequacy of lighthouse\ncoverage, and this inadequacy could be blamed on decentralized management,\nflaws within the various lighthouse authorities, and the high level of tolls, which\nwas thought to discourage shipowners from petitioning for more lighthouses.\nBut examination of the language of reform reveals that when protection of \u2018 the\n&\u2019 Brewster, \u2018Parliamentary report \u2019, p. 222. &( Hansard, 3rd ser., xxvii, 252.\n&) Ibid., xv, 1075. &* Ibid., 1073. \u2019!

The system\ninvolved \u2018culpable prodigality of the public money\u2019.\u2019&\nIt was the shipowners who had to pay the tolls, but to reformers, this toll\nmoney was \u2018public money\u2019. This notion of \u2018 the public \u2019 was employed both to\nisolate private owners and to broaden the issue beyond the narrow one of\nlighthouse owners versus shipowners into the more general one of private\ninterest versus public good. The private interests of the lighthouse proprietors\ncould then be contrasted with the broader public interest which private\nownership was said to damage. Shipowners, merchants, producers, and,\nimportantly, consumers were all held to share this public interest.\u2019\u2019 Reformers\nfollowed the Ricardian principle that \u2018Any tax which may be imposed on the\ncultivator \u2026 will increase the cost of production, and will therefore raise the\nprice of raw produce \u2026 A tax on raw produce would not be paid by the\nlandlord; it would not be paid by the farmer; but it would be paid, in an\nincreased price, by the consumer. \u2019\u2019( Brewster was particularly keen to highlight\nthe stake consumers had in reform, asserting that, in reality, the tolls were not\npaid by the shipping interest but by \u2018every consumer of foreign and domestic\nproduce carried coastwise : every child that sucks an orange, and every dandy\nthat smokes a cigar, is a contributor to the lighthouse revenue\u2019.\u2019) That the\ninterests of a section of the business community and the national interest had\nbecome mixed up together in the rhetoric of reform is suggested by the\nargument of Robert Dow Ker, a merchant and shipowner, and chairman of the\nGreenock chamber of commerce: \u2018 the principle of private lighthouses is highly\nobjectionable, as committing a trust affecting life and public property in the\nhands of private individuals. It is a manifest disregard of public rights, and, in\npractice, the system has been most injurious to the shipping interest. \u2019\u2019* This\nblending together of business and public interests was a crucial means of\nwinning support for change.\nWith private and public interests defined by reformers in this way, the\nsurplus collection which was the key to private profit was presented as an\nunmitigated evil, \u2018a great waste of the public resources \u2019.(!

The tolls\ndrained money away from commerce into the pockets of lighthouse owners and\npensioners. Reform of this system was therefore in the public interest as it would\nredistribute economic resources from lighthouse owners and pensioners to\nshipowners, and by implication, to the public as a whole.\nThe advocates of lighthouse reform were thus not merely attacking\ncorruption, they were attacking the very existence of private property in a\npublic service. It is striking that in the 1830s there were no proposals for\nreforming private lighthouse ownership as a strategy for its long-term\npreservation, such as state-enforced reduction of private toll rates, such as had\nbeen imposed in the 1820s on the lighthouses operators whose leases had\nexpired, or competitive tender for lighthouse contracts. The demand was for\nthe abolition, not reform, of private lighthouse property.($ Private property, in\nlighthouses as in everything else, arose from decisions made by government\nabout which resources should be appropriated by individuals and which\nresources should not. Government, as the authority which created and enforced\nproperty rights, also had the power to exclude resources from the realm of\nprivate property. Underpinning lighthouse reform, therefore, was a criticism of\nthe willingness of government to make private property out of a public\nresource. According to Hume, neither the state nor Trinity House had the right\nto allow the private appropriation of the lights.(% Importantly, however, the\nstate was viewed as capable of correcting its past behaviour and acting in the\npublic interest. Doing this entailed reforming private property in what was\nconstrued as a disinterested way. This was true not only of lighthouse reform,\nbut of charity, borough, corporation, and tithe reform. In the case of lighthouse\nreform, putting an end to old corruption meant moving lighthouses from the\nprivate to the public sphere by the state : in effect, a nationalization of the\nlighthouse property. Lighthouse reformers were quite conscious that they were\nreplacing private with national ownership. Thomas Wyse, a Liberal MP,\nreferring to lighthouse centralization, spoke in parliament of \u2018 the nationalising\nof the business \u2019,(& while the reformer Robert Cutlar Ferguson argued that \u2018 the\nwhole of the lighthouse establishment should be a national establishment \u2026 the\nestablishment should be national, the expense national \u2019.(\u2019\nNationalization redistributed the property of the light tolls within the\nprivate sector from the lighthouse owners to shipowners. This transfer could\nonly be effected by state power: the grant of voluntary powers of purchase to\nTrinity House in 1822 had failed to eradicate private ownership.

Trinity House was not an automatic\nchoice, for it had plenty of opponents. In 1816 Joseph Birch, a whig MP,\nmerchant, and shipowner called for a select committee to investigate Trinity\nHouse, complaining that the tax levied by Trinity House on shipping was\n\u2018extravagant\u2019 and compared the corporation unfavourably with the com-\nmissioners of northern lights. The surpluses \u2018had been uselessly and repre-\nhensibly squandered for the gratification of a taste for show, or purchase of\narticles of luxury: he alluded to the splendid establishment of the Trinity-\nhouse, the Trinity-yacht, the entertainments given by the brethren\u2019.() In 1823,\na leading article in The Times indicated the level of dissatisfaction with Trinity\nHouse in the business community: \u2018The Merchants, whose letters by hundreds\nare before us, and whose murmurs against this Company are deep and\nuniversal, exclaim, that its charter ought to be withdrawn; that its powers have\nbeen abused; its duties overpaid and neglected; its funds swollen beyond their\nlawful bulk, and diverted from their honest purposes. \u2019(* Significantly, though\ncritical itself of the \u2018neglect and prodigality \u2019 running through Trinity House\u2019s\nmanagement, the newspaper thought that satisfactory results could be obtained\nby reforming rather than abolishing the corporation: \u2018 let the abuses be\nredressed, and the services contemplated by the [founding] charter be fairly\nperformed; and then let the Brethren invite their friends, and enjoy their\nannual venison and Burgundy unmolested\u2019.)! Trinity House, clearly stung by\nsuch public criticism, did reform itself after 1822, reducing dues, buying out\nprivate lessees, building new lights, and waiving its claims to government\ncompensation resulting from the reciprocity treaties.\nBut in the 1830s, radicals continued to oppose vesting the lights in Trinity\nHouse. They objected to \u2018defects \u2019 in the constitution of the board, a self-\nconstituted, self-perpetuating body which they thought must not be given extra\npowers. It should be remembered that both charitable and municipal\ncorporations were under attack in this period as public institutions which were\nprimarily concerned with serving their constituents \u2019 private interests. There-\nfore it was perhaps unsurprising that radicals should highlight the flaws of this\nparticular corporation, which contained no naval or scientific men but was\n(( These petitions were received on 19 Aug. 1835, and on 2 Mar., 7 July, 12 July, 25 July, and\n26 July 1836 : House of Commons Journals, 90, p. 569 ; ibid., 91, pp. 104, 634, and 652 ; House of Lords\nJournals, 68, pp. 741 and 747.

Hume was never happy with the prospect of Trinity House control.\nHe wanted the government to take up the question and establish a separate\nboard, imploring, \u2018What was the Board of Trade for, if not to undertake the\nmanagement of such matters as this? \u2019)# This appeal did not move the board,\nand by the time of the committee stage of the 1836 bill, the radicals had\nchanged tack, now somewhat surprisingly proposing that the Admiralty be\nplaced in charge of lighthouses. William Ewart, a radical MP, argued that it\nwas necessary to \u2018bring the lighthouses of the country under the control of a\nbody which would be subject to greater responsibility than at present existed.\nIt was idle to suppose, that a body such as the Trinity Board constituted out of\nthe House, having no representatives in the House, could be so responsible as\nthe Admiralty. \u2019)$ Significantly, Admiralty control would also be a means of\ntransferring the financial burden of maintenance on to the state. Hume\nthought that as his majesty\u2019s ships derived the same advantages from\nlighthouses as traders, but were exempt from tolls, it was fair that \u2018 the expenses\nof the light-houses of the country, ought to be placed on the same footing as the\nConsular charges, and those expenses ought to be defrayed as part of the public\nburthens, out of the public purse \u2019.)%\nThe radicals pushed their Admiralty plan to a division in the committee\nstage of the 1836 bill, and lost heavily, by sixty-eight votes to seven. But Hume,\na keen advocate of retrenchment, did not give up his campaign for even greater\ngovernment control of the lighthouse system. An 1845 select committee,\nchaired by Hume, was established to consider the extent to which the\nrecommendations of the 1834 committee had been carried out, and to\ndetermine whether further reforms were required. It called for the abolition of\nlight dues, for the whole lighthouse establishment to be paid for out of public\nrevenues, and for the Treasury to take on Trinity House\u2019s debts. Again, these\nproposals failed to gain significant support.)& These failures can largely be\nexplained by the fact that, due to its policies after 1822, Trinity House had\ncome to be widely viewed as a responsible and competent public body which\nrendered the creation of a new government department to run lighthouses or\nthe burdening of an existing one unnecessary.

The \u2018defects \u2019 in Trinity\nHouse\u2019s constitution could be overlooked as the corporation\u2019s recent conduct\nhad won it substantial political support.)\u2019\nIn debates in the 1830s, the lights controlled by Trinity House were referred\nto as \u2018public lights \u2019 in contrast to the \u2018private lights \u2019 owned by individuals. It\ncan be argued that Trinity House provides another example of the type of\ninstitution which, Timothy Alborn argues, indicates the anachronism of\nimposing clear distinctions between public and private spheres on this period.\nLike the East India Company and the Bank of England, Trinity House was\nnominally a private corporation, but performed a public role which would\notherwise have had to be performed by a central government agency.)( Its\nsuccess in doing so, like the other institutions, depended on its ability to revise\nits administrative strategies \u2018 to keep up with the changing needs of industry\nand commerce\u2019, in other words its ability to be seen to be acting in the\nperceived public interest.)) It passed this test, and so was able not only to\nsurvive attacks on its constitution, but emerged with its responsibilities\nenhanced. Yet it did not manage to defend its autonomy from encroachments\nby the state. The 1836 act made all three lighthouse boards literally\naccountable : henceforth they were required to submit annual accounts of\nincome and expenditure, and make annual reports of improvements and\nalterations to lighthouses to parliament.)* Accountability gave way to direct\ncontrol under the terms of the Merchant Shipping Law Amendment Act of\n1853 which merged the funds of all three lighthouse boards to create the\nmercantile marine fund, and stipulated that all expenditure from this new fund\nhad to be approved by the board of trade.*!\nOutright nationalization, by vesting the lights in the Admiralty, did not\nreceive wide support, but quasi-nationalization, with Trinity House as the\nuniform authority, was backed by both whigs and tories. Trinity House\ntherefore became the sole lighthouse authority for England. But for many\nreformers, nationalizing lighthouses meant more than the abolition of private\nownership: it also meant putting an end to the multiplicity of public boards\nand creating a single authority for the whole of the United Kingdom. By the\n1830s, the imposition of UK-wide uniformity of lighthouse management was a\npopular demand. But this was opposed by Irish and Scottish interests, with the\nresult that, in practice, reform meant nationalization for England rather than\nfor the UK. John Wilson, the Scottish tory, writing in Blackwood \u2019s Magazine,\ndefended the commissioners of the northern lights from the attacks of the\nEdinburgh Review and others, arguing that as the commissioners were \u2018un-\nconnected with the shipping interest \u2019 they were \u2018at all times unbiassed by local\npredilections ; their sole object was steadily to keep in view the general benefit\n)\u2019 Two notable supporters were Poulett Thomson and Peel : Hansard, 3rd ser., xxxv, 141 and\n144. )( Alborn, Conceiving companies, pp. 1\u20138. )) Ibid., p. 7.\n)* 6 & 7 Will. iv c. 79, section lxii, though the commissioners of northern lights already\nsubmitted annual accounts. *! 16 & 17 Vict. c. 131.\n768 james taylor\nof the trade of the country\u2019.*\" Irish MPs rushed to the defence of the ballast\nboard.

Henry\nWarburton, the radical, who opposed Trinity House control, remarked that he\n\u2018did not know why the members of the Trinity Board should not be under the\nCommissioners of Northern Lights, as the latter be under the control of the\nformer\u2019.*& But this was intended to illustrate a point rather than represent a\nserious proposal : Warburton favoured Admiralty control. The choice of\nTrinity House, while facilitating English nationalization, vitiated the chances\nof UK nationalization, for this alienated even those Scottish and Irish MPs who\nwere otherwise sympathetic to the principle of uniform management. It was\ntoo much for these members to bear to see their boards abolished in favour of\nan existing English board which they believed to be inferior to their own.\nChristopher Fitzsimon, MP for Dublin County, after recording that he was \u2018a\ndeclared enemy to another union\u2019, stated that \u2018here was proposed one of the\nmost extraordinary legislative unions he had heard of \u2026 Here it was proposed\nto unite an admittedly well-conducted Irish Board, against which no charge\nwas made, with a most faulty London Board, against which great and\nexpensive mis-management was proved. \u2019 Fitzsimon told Hume that if he\nproposed to abolish all the boards and light tolls and to support lighthouses\nfrom the general revenues of the country, he would back him, but he would\noppose any scheme which privileged the English authority over the Irish.*\u2019 The\nScottish lord advocate, speaking \u2018on the part of the people of Scotland\u2019, told\nthe House that he \u2018would have no objection to see the whole light-house system\nof the United Kingdom placed under the Board of Admiralty, but he did object\nto having it under the control of the Trinity Board\u2019.*( Such appeals forced the\nabandonment of the proposal to make Trinity House the sole lighthouse\n*\" John Wilson, \u2018Northern lighthouses \u2019, Blackwood \u2019s Magazine, 34 (Sept. 1833), p. 364.\n*# Hansard, 3rd ser., xxvii, 259. *$ Ibid., xxxi, 173. *% Ibid., 175.\n*& Ibid., xxxv, 139.\n*\u2019 Ibid., xxvii, 262.

This indicates that there were political limits to the extent to\nwhich centralization could be imposed, as national loyalty (that is, to Ireland\nand Scotland) was stronger than loyalty to the idea of Britishness. However, the\n1836 act did render the other boards subordinate to Trinity House: they were\nno longer allowed to erect new lights, or remove or alter existing ones without\nTrinity House\u2019s permission, and Trinity House employees were given the\npower to inspect the Scottish and Irish lights.\nWith the creation of a central authority for the United Kingdom blocked,\nthe principal achievement of the reform was the nationalization of the English\nlighthouses, which was understood to mean a transferral of lighthouses from the\nprivate to the public sphere, carried out by the state, representing the public,\nand involving another public institution, Trinity House. This process was\nrendered slightly more complicated by the fact that when the five private lights\nleased by the crown to private individuals were transferred to Trinity House,\nthe crown had to be compensated for its loss of property. A figure of \u00a3300,000\nwas arrived at by the government and this was to be paid to the crown by\nparliament: the land revenues of the crown were released from a debt of\n\u00a3300,000 previously advanced by the consolidated fund. In this way, the\ncrown\u2019s rights could be compensated without burdening shipping with the\ndebt.\nInterestingly, compensation for the private interests in lighthouses, in cases\nwhere terms could not be agreed between Trinity House and private owners,\nwas decided not by the government but by local juries. In such cases, the matter\nwould be referred to a local jury within five years of the passing of the act. The\ninquiry would take place in the county in which the light was situated, and the\nsheriff of the county would be responsible for summoning twelve \u2018 sufficient and\nindifferent Men\u2019,*) who were not to have any economic interest, direct or\nindirect, in the lighthouse in question.** The sheriff would call all relevant\nwitnesses, then the jury would give a verdict \u2018 for the true, fair and just Value\u2019\nof the lighthouse, \u2018having regard to the Rights, Benefits, and Advantages\nresulting to the Proprietors from the Enjoyment thereof \u2019.\"!!

The benefits felt in the long term by shipping\nthough were substantial : shipping paid \u00a3434,216 in dues in 1845 to all UK\nauthorities ; this had fallen to \u00a3281,202 by 1861.\"!# This reduction was also\nfacilitated by the 1853 reform which signalled the end of Trinity House\u2019s\npension fund. This reform had been blocked by the whigs in 1836, and was not\ntaken up by the Conservatives in the 1840s despite agitation from Hume. But\nthe climate had changed by the time the Aberdeen government came to power.\nEdward Cardwell, the new president of the board of trade, began a substantial\nreform of the mercantile marine, which culminated in 1854 with the lengthy\nMerchant Shipping Act.\"!$ In 1853, the government signalled its intention to\nbring the funds of the three lighthouse authorities under the control of the\nboard of trade, and to phase out pension payments, which would allow dues to\nbe reduced to cover the costs of administration only. This provoked a letter to\nCardwell from Prince Albert in his capacity of master of Trinity House. He\npointed out the traditional rights of the pensioners to this money, and hoped\nthat these rights, if ended by the government, would not go uncompensated.\nHe compared these ancient rights with those of the recently appropriated\nprivate owners, reminding Cardwell \u2018 that Parliament has, within a com-\nparatively short period, recognised the claims of wealthy and influential\nindividuals holding revenues from lighthouses ; and which claims were founded\nupon precisely the same grounds as those which apply to the poor and helpless\nclass whose interests are now in jeopardy\u2019.\"!% The elder brethren also opposed\nthe proposed redistribution, asserting that \u2018 the lighthouses and light dues\nbelong to them, for the purposes of the Corporation, and are, in the strictest\nsense, their property\u2019, and that Trinity House should be able to decide what it\ndid with its own property. They were quite aware that reform meant\nredistribution:\nNow, the proposal of Her Majesty\u2019s Government appears to be that the use of the\nwhole of this vast mass of property shall be given to the shipowners, without any charge\nbeyond the expense of maintaining the lights. It is, as affecting the Corporation\u2019s\ncharities, an alienation of property, devoted to the benefit of the decayed masters and\nseamen of the merchants \u2019 service, and their families, and a gift of that property to the\nshipowners.\"!&\nThe government\u2019s response indicated the extent to which Trinity House,\nthough having gained responsibilities, had lost its independence.

Lighthouse reform is best understood alongside con-\ntemporaneous interferences in charities, corporations, tithes, the monopolies of\nchartered companies, and other species of property. The process of reform\nprovides a particularly striking example of the way in which traditional\ninstitutions and forms of property came to be viewed as problematic in this\nperiod. Private ownership of lighthouses, which had existed for centuries, came\nunder increasing attack, due to the burdens high tolls and decentralized\nmanagement were said to impose on the public. Lighthouse reformers insisted\nthat high tolls affected not only shipowners, but merchants, producers, and\nconsumers as well. The toll money was therefore \u2018public money\u2019 which was\nbeing unjustly siphoned off by private owners, and, to a lesser extent, Trinity\nHouse pensioners. Private ownership was thus held up as a blatant example of\n\u2018old corruption\u2019 which had to be replaced by public control. By the mid-1830s,\nthere was broad consensus across the parties and within the government that\npublic control was desirable, but there were a number of ways to achieve this.\nDespite criticism of Trinity House\u2019s constitution and past conduct (largely\nfrom radical quarters) and the contemporary attacks on the established rights\nand privileges of corporations, Trinity House was selected as the sole lighthouse\nauthority for England, as a means of securing public control of lighthouses\nwithout burdening the Admiralty or creating a new government department.\nBoth the state and Trinity House were acquiring new roles as guardians of the\npublic interest. While the rhetoric of old corruption condemned these bodies as\nthe problem, lighthouse reform showed them as the solution to the problem.\nBoth bodies, it was believed, were capable of acting in the public interest,\nthough in 1836 and even more in 1853, Trinity House\u2019s freedom of action was\ncurtailed by greater government control.\nLighthouse reform is significant because the state intervened to redistribute\nover a million pounds worth of property in order to create more freedom for\ntrade, pursuing a policy of nationalization to secure retrenchment. The state\nhad to determine the legitimacy of the competing claims of lighthouse owners,\npensioners, and shipowners to the property of the tolls. In 1836 and in 1853, the\nshipowners were the only group successfully to claim that their interest was the\npublic interest. Once it became generally accepted that there was a conflict\nbetween the property of the lighthouse owners and the pensioners on one hand,\nand the public on the other, the state stepped in to transfer the property of the\ntolls to the shipowners, and therefore, so reformers argued, to the public.\n\"!( 16 & 17 Vict. c. 131, section xii.\n"}
