During the operation of the EISCAT high power\nfacility (heater) at Troms\u00f8, Norway, on 8 October 1998, the\nFAST spacecraft made electric field and particle observa-\ntions in the inner magnetosphere at 0.39 Earth radii above\nthe heated ionospheric region. Measurements of the direct\ncurrent electric field clearly exhibit oscillations with a fre-\nquency close to the modulated frequency of heater (\u223c 3 Hz)\nand an amplitude of \u223c 2 \u2212 5 mV m\u22121. Thermal electron\ndata from the electrostatic analyser show the modulation at\nthe same frequency of the downward electron fluxes. During\nthis period the EISCAT UHF incoherent scatter radar, sited\nalso at Troms\u00f8, measured a significant enhancement of the\nelectron density in E-layer up to 2 \u00b7 1012m\u22123. These obser-\nvations have prompted us to make quantitative estimates of\nthe expected pulsations in the inner magnetosphere caused\nby the modulated HF heating of lower ionosphere. Under the\nconditions of the strong electron precipitation in the iono-\nsphere, which took place during the FAST observations, the\nprimary current caused by the perturbation of the conduc-\ntivity in the heated region is closed entirely by the parallel\ncurrent which leaks into the magnetosphere. In such cir-\ncumstances the conditions at the ionosphere-magnetosphere\nboundary are most favourable for the launching of an Alfve\u00b4n\nwave: it is launched from the node in the gradient of the\nscalar potential which is proportional to the parallel current.\nThe parallel electric field of the Alfve\u00b4n wave is significant in\nthe region where the electron inertial length is of order of the\ntransverse wavelength of the Alfve\u00b4n wave or larger and may\neffectively accelerate superthermal electrons downward into\nthe ionosphere.\nKey words. Ionosphere (active experiments; ionosphere \u2013\nmagnetosphere interactions; particle acceleration)\n1 Introduction\nObservations reported in a recent paper by Robinson et\nal. (2000) clearly demonstrated that ULF waves observed by\nCorrespondence to: E. Kolesnikova (elka@ion.le.ac.uk)\nthe FAST satellite at an altitude of 2550 km were caused by\nthe modulated heating of the lower ionosphere by the EIS-\nCAT high power facility at Troms\u00f8, Norway. 3 Hz oscilla-\ntions with an amplitude of about 2 \u2212 5 mV m\u22121 were de-\ntected by the FAST electric field antenna during approxi-\nmately 3 seconds when the satellite track passed above the\nheated patch of ionosphere. Robinson et al. (2000) also re-\nported observations of 3 Hz oscillations in the downward di-\nrected component of electron fluxes which they attributed to\nparallel electric field caused by electron inertia effect associ-\nated with an Alfve\u00b4n wave. A limited number of papers (see,\nfor example, Kimura et al., 1994 and references in it) have\nreported heater induced VLF waves detected by spacecraft-\nborne receivers when spacecraft passed in the vicinity of\nTroms\u00f8 heater. The above-mentioned FAST observations\nconstitute a first space detection of artificial ULF waves.\nA detailed theoretical analysis of artificial magnetic pulsa-\ntions in the low frequency range, caused by modulated HF\nheating of the ionosphere has been carried out previously\nby Stubbe and Kopka (1977), Pashin et al. (1995), Lyatsky\net al. (1996), Borisov and Stubbe (1997). The last authors\nincluded the field-aligned current and constructed a quanti-\ntative model of the generation of three-dimensional currents\ndue to the periodic heating which produce both magnetic per-\nturbations on the ground and also Alfve\u00b4n waves propagating\nupward from the upper ionosphere. In our paper we follow\nthe approach proposed by Borisov and Stubbe (1997) and\ndevelop it further for the conditions of strong electron pre-\ncipitation, with the aim of determining the current system\nexcited in the ionosphere by the modulated heating of the\nlower ionosphere.\nWe begin in Sect. 2 by briefly reviewing the heater ex-\nperimental arrangements, geophysical conditions during the\nheater operation and related FAST observations. In Sect. 3,\nwe give, (i) a discussion of the HF heater wave absorp-\ntion and the resulting heating effect in the absorption layer,\n(ii) a brief overview of the model proposed by Borisov and\nStubbe (1997) and its development for the case of strong\nskin effect and (iii) results of the model applied to the iono-\nspheric conditions observed during the FAST measurements.\n58 E.

The HF signal was modulated by the square-\nwave with a fundamental frequency of 3 Hz and effective ra-\ndiated power Wo of approximately 2 \u00b7 105 kW. Hereafter, we\nassume that higher harmonics may be neglected, therefore\nthe variation of the modulated HF electric field at a height z\nand at a horizontal distance r from the transmitter takes the\nform (Gurevich, 1978)\nEo(r, z) \u2248 300\n\u221a\nWo\/4\nz\ne\u2212r2\/a2\n(\n1+ \u03b3 cost), (1)\nwhere Eo is given in mV m\u22121, Wo in kW, z in km, a is a\nradius of the heated spot (\u223c 10 km at a height 80 km), is the\nfundamental modulated frequency ( = 18.8 radians s\u22121)\nand \u03b3 \u2248 2\/pi .\n2.2 FAST observations\nAs reported by Robinson et al. (2000), during the above ex-\nperiment, the electric field antenna installed on the board the\nFAST satellite observed 3 Hz waves with an amplitude of\n\u223c 2\u22125 mV m\u22121 between\u223c 20:16:20 UT and\u223c 20:16:23 UT\nat an altitude of 2550 km (Fig. 1a). The electric field an-\ntenna was oriented approximately perpendicular to the mag-\nnetic field line. Simultaneous measurements of the electron\nfluxes in three energetic channels of the electrostatic anal-\nyser with the central energies: 37, 74 and 149 eV show a\ncorresponding quasi-periodic acceleration of the downward\nelectrons (Fig. 1b). Each energy band exhibits similar oscil-\nlations with a common period of 3 Hz. However, they have\nphases different from that of the electric field oscillations and\nalso different from each other. The fact that the phases of the\nmore energetic electrons lead is consistent with a source of\nthe electron fluxes at several hundred km above the obser-\nvation point. Note that the upgoing electrons in the same\nenergy bands (Fig. 1c) do not exhibit any significant 3 Hz\nmodulation. A detailed discussion of the mechanism which\ncauses the electron acceleration is given in Sect. 4.\n2.3 Geophysical conditions\nThe electron density profile at altitudes between 80 and\n600 km above the heater patch was obtained from observa-\ntions of the EISCAT UHF incoherent scatter radar located\nin the vicinity of the Troms\u00f8 heater. The density profile\nin Fig. 2a corresponds to the radar integration period of\n10 seconds which commences at 20:16:20 UT and conse-\nquently covers the period of the FAST observations. A sig-\nnificant enhancement of the electron density in E-layer up to\n2 \u00b7 1012 m\u22123 was due to the increase precipitation of elec-\ntrons into ionosphere during the experiment. The bulk veloc-\nity of the plasma at 250 km above the Troms\u00f8 heater, as es-\ntimated using tristatic measurements from the three UHF re-\nceivers during a \u223c 30 s timeperiod, had the main component\ndirected towards north with an amplitude of \u223c 240 m s\u22121.\nConsequently the electric field associated with the V \u00d7 Bo\ndrift pointed eastwards, with an amplitude of \u223c 12 mV m\u22121.\nMolecular composition and temperature in the midnight sec-\ntor as deduced from the ionospheric model MSIS90 (Hedin,\n1991) are presented in the Figs. 2b and c. The electron\ntemperature is taken as that for the neutral gas at the low\naltitudes, z < 250 km (Gurevich, 1978). The magnetic\nfield line which is mapped to the Troms\u00f8 site (69.58 N,\nE.

(7)\nThe variation with height of the absorption and refractive\ncoefficients and the amplitude of electric field of the radiated\nHF X wave are presented in Figs. 4a, b. The exact solu-\ntion for the absorption coefficient (6), which is shown by a\nsolid line in Fig. 4a, does not differ significantly from the ap-\nproximate solution (5), given by a dashed line at the altitudes\nwhere the refractive index is close to unity. Near the reflec-\ntion region where \u00b5 \u2192 0 the two solutions differ signifi-\ncantly. The transmitted HF wave is absorbed in a thin layer\nbetween \u223c 80 km, where the electron density commences to\nbe significant, and the reflection point at \u223c 88 km (Fig. 4b).\nThe absorbed part of the wave energy goes to the heating of\nthe local plasma.\n3.2 Modulation of the Pedersen and the Hall conductivities\nUnder the action of HF radio waves the electron temperature\nin the ionosphere may be increased considerably. The devia-\ntion of the electron temperature from the neutral temperature,\n\u03b4Te, caused by the modulated wave consists of two parts: (i)\na stationary perturbation\n\u03b4T (0)e \u2248\n(\n1+ \u03b3 2\/2)Teo[Eo\u03ba(z)\/Ep]2\nand (ii) a modulated perturbation with frequency\n, \u03b4T (1)e \u2248 2\u03b3 Teo\n[\nEo\u03ba(z)\/Ep\n]2;\nhere Teo (in K) is the undisturbed temperature, Ep is a char-\nacteristic plasma field which, in the case of the high fre-\nquency pump wave (\u03c9 \u001d \u03bden), is given by\nEp \u2248\n\u221a\n3Teomee\u22122\u03b4o\u03c92\n(Gurevich, 1978), where \u03b4o is the average fraction of the en-\nergy lost by the electron in one collision (\u03b4o \u2248 10\u22123). There-\nfore, ifEo\u03ba\/Ep \u223c 1 (Fig. 4b) then the energy absorbed in the\nionosphere will increase both the stationary and modulated\nparts of the electron temperature by a factor of \u223c 2.\nDue to the changes of electron temperature the electron-\nneutral collision frequency and recombination coefficient are\nalso modified. If we assume that the term Eo\u03ba\/Ep \u2264 1 then\nthe collision frequency and recombination coefficient vary\nproportionally to the electron temperature, respectively as,\n\u03b4\u03bden\/\u03bden \u2248 0.8\u03b4Te\/Teo and \u03b4\u03b1r\/\u03b1r \u2248 \u22120.7\u03b4Te\/Teo (Gure-\nvich, 1978). Consequently the stationary part of plasma den-\nsity follows the same law, namely \u03b4ne\/ne \u2248 0.35\u03b4Te\/Te.\nOn the other hand, the modulated part does not exhibit\nany density change because the frequency of recombina-\ntion \u03b1rne \u2248 10\u22123 radians s\u22121 is small with respect to .\nAs a result, the perturbation of the modulated part of the\nPedersen and the Hall conductivities in the plasma, with\n1 \u001d \u03bden\/\u03c9ce \u001d \u03c9ci\/\u03bdin (which represents the ionospheric\nconditions below \u223c 90 km), may be written\n\u03b4\u03c3P \u2248 0.8\u03b4T\n(1)\ne\nTeo\n\u03c3p, (8)\nE.

Consequently, the electron temper-\nature will be changed, but the secondary modification of the\ntemperature will be \u223c e\u2212n\u2032e\u03bd\u2032en\/(ne\u03bden) times less than the pri-\nmary one and therefore may be neglected under the condition\nEo\u03ba\/Ep \u223c 1.\n3.3 Polarization field and currents\nChanges in the conductivities in the presence of a dc exter-\nnal convection electric field E lead to the primary current\njo = \u03b4\u03c3\u02c6 \u00b7 E that acts only in the heated layer. Hereafter\nit is assumed that the external electric field E is approxi-\nmately constant in the lower ionosphere and E \u00b7 Bo \u2248 0.\nThen in cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03d5, z), the components of\nthe external electric field are Er = E cos\u03d5, E\u03d5 = \u2212E sin\u03d5,\nEz = 0 and the primary current is jo = {\u03b4\u03c3PEr +\n\u03b4\u03c3HE\u03d5, \u2212\u03b4\u03c3HEr + \u03b4\u03c3PE\u03d5, 0} \u00b7 exp(\u2212r2\/a2). Such a cur-\nrent gives rise to a polarization electric field \u03b4E in the iono-\nsphere together with a secondary current j \u2032\u22a5 = \u03c3\u02c6 \u00b7 \u03b4E and\na parallel current j \u2032z which close the primary one. If we\nassume that all time dependent perturbed quantities vary as\neit , then the electric field perturbation can be written in the\nform, \u03b4E = \u2212\u2207\u03c6 \u2212 iA, where \u03c6 and A are scalar and\nvector potentials.

If the dispersion relations (38), (39) are satis-\nfied, then the parallel electric field grows in proportion to\n\u223c (neVAa)\u22121Er , in a plasma with \u03bbkr \u001c 1, VA \u001c c and\nin proportion to \u223c \u221anec\u22121Er , when \u03bbkr \u001d 1, VA \u001d c.\nIt is convenient to describe a sheared Alfve\u00b4n wave in terms\nof a scalar potential \u03c6 and a vector potential A = Azz where\nB = \u2207\u22a5 \u00d7 (Azz). Substituting Er = ikr\u03c6 and B\u03d5 = ikrAz\ninto (34\u201336) we obtain the following relation between \u03c6 and\nAz,\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202z\n= \u2212i(1+ k2r \u03bb2)Az. (41)\nAnother relation between \u03c6 and Az comes from Ampere\u2019s\nlaw, including the displacement current (see, for example,\nLysak, 1993), i.e.,\n\u2202Az\n\u2202z\n= \u2212i1+ V\n2\nA\/c\n2\nV 2A\n\u03c6. (42)\nThe combination of the last two equations gives\n\u22022\u03c6\n\u2202z2\n\u2212 \u03b11(z)\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202z\n+ \u03b1o(z)\u03c6 = 0, (43)\nwith \u03b11(z) = 2k2r \u03bb\/{1 + k2r \u03bb2} \u2202\u03bb\/\u2202z,\n\u03b1o(z) = 2(1 + k2r \u03bb2)\/{V 2A\/(1 + V 2A\/c2)}. By Faraday\u2019s\nand Ampere\u2019s laws, the perpendicular electric and magnetic\nfields must be continuous across the magnetosphere-\nionosphere interface, and thus scalar and vector potentials\nmust also be continuous at this boundary. The vector\npotential is driven by the parallel current which continuously\nleaks through the boundary. Then,\nAz(z = zi) \u2248 \u2212 i\u00b5o\nk2r\njz. (44)\nThe scalar potential is defined by the polarisation electric\nfield, see Eq. (25) or (31). If the skin effect is strong, i.e.,\nk1a \u001d 1, then |\u03c6| \u001c VA(zi)|Az| and the boundary condi-\ntions are\n\u03c6(z = zi) \u2248 0, (45)\n64 E.

(46)\nEquation (43) may be easily solved numerically (using a\nRunge-Kutta scheme) if the variation of coefficients \u03b1o and\n\u03b11 is known and the boundary conditions are defined.\nThe parallel electric field may be written as a function of\nscalar and vector potentials, as\nEz = \u2212iAz \u2212 \u2202\u03c6\n\u2202z\n=\n[\n1\n1+ k2r \u03bb2\n\u2212 1\n]\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202z\n. (47)\nIf the electron inertial length is small, then the contribution of\nthe vector potential cancels the contribution of scalar poten-\ntial and the parallel electric field vanishes. When \u03bb grows, the\ncontribution of vector potential to the parallel electric field\ndecreases and for the conditions kr\u03bb \u001d 1, the parallel elec-\ntric field is entirely determined by the scalar potential.\nIn order to investigate the properties of the Alfve\u00b4n\nwave a profile of Alfve\u00b4n speed of the form (33) is\nchosen, with Alfve\u00b4n speed in the upper ionosphere\nVA(zi \u2248 300 km) \u2248 3 \u00b7 106 m s\u22121 and the characteristic\nheight h \u2248 260 km which are found from fitting of the mea-\nsured plasma density between 300 and 600 km by the EIS-\nCAT radar. The magnitude of parallel current in the up-\nper ionosphere is taken as jz \u2248 0.04\u00b5A m\u22122, as estimated\nin the previous section. Variation with altitude of the elec-\ntron density, the Alfve\u00b4n speed, \u03bbk and \u03bbz, which are calcu-\nlated according to the dispersion Eqs. (38), (39), are shown\nin the Fig. 6. The scalar potential, which is found from\nEq. (43) with the boundary conditions (45), (46), is presented\nin Fig. 7a for two cases: (i) \u03b11 6= 0, i.e. \u2202\u03bb\/\u2202z 6= 0 (solid\nline) and (ii) \u03b11 = 0 (dashed line). It can been seen from the\nfigure that from an altitude of \u223c 2300 km, where the electron\ninertial length commences to be of the order of the trans-\nverse wavelength (i.e., \u03bbkr \u223c 1), the two solutions diverge\nsignificantly. This means that from such altitudes inhomoge-\nneous properties of the plasma play a major role. The condi-\ntions of Alfve\u00b4n wave launching from the node of the potential\n(\u03c6(z = zi) \u2248 0 at the boundary) are the most favourable to\namplify the amplitude of wave at the highest altitudes. The\namplitude of the potential will be proportional to the magni-\ntude of the parallel current at the boundary. The node which\nappears at \u223c 1040 km above the upper ionospheric boundary\nindicates a partial reflection of the wave due to contribution\nof the gradient of Alfve\u00b4n velocity to the refractive index and\ncorresponds to the condition VA [\u2202VA\/\u2202z]\u22121 = 2h \u2248 \u03bbz\/2.\nIn the same figure the vector potential, multiplied by the\nAlfve\u00b4n speed at the upper ionospheric boundary, z = zi , is\npresented, again for the two conditions: (i) \u03b11 6= 0 (dashed-\ndotted line) and (ii) \u03b11 = 0 (dotted line). Variations of trans-\nverse and parallel electric fields are shown in the Figs. 7b, c\nby solid lines. Here again the solution for the case \u03b11 = 0\nis presented by the dashed line. The amplitude of the trans-\nverse electric field at the altitude of the FAST observation\n(\u223c 2550 km) is found to be\u223c 1 mV m\u22121 (which is consistent\na\nb\nc\nFig. 6\nFig. 6.

(51)\nThe variations of the electron speed and the flight time\nwith altitude are presented in Fig. 9 for two values of\nthe electron velocity at the altitude z1 = 2550 km,\nu1 = 3.6\u00b7106 m s\u22121(37 eV) and u1 = 5.1\u00b7106 m s\u22121(74 eV).\nValue of the potential at the altitude z1 = 2550 km and the\ncharacteristic spatial scale of the potential variation are taken\nfrom the results of the previous section, i.e., \u03d5(z1) = 5 V\nand h = 260 km. Knowing the delay time \u223c 0.05 s be-\ntween arrival of electrons with energies 37 and 74 eV, we\nconclude that the upper boundary of the acceleration region\nlies at \u223c 520 km above the spacecraft track.\nUpward and downward electron fluxes measured by the\nelectrostatic analyser in two energy channels with the centre\nenergies 37 and 74 eV (Fig. 1b, c) provide a possibility to re-\nconstruct the distribution function. For simplicity we assume\nthat a warm population may be reasonably described by an\n66 E. Kolesnikova et al.: Excitation of Alfve\u00b4n waves by modulated HF heating\nFig. 9\na\nb\nFig. 9.

The profile of the potential is taken in the\nform (49) with \u03d5(z1) = 5 V and h = 260 km.

The electron flux F recorded in a channel with\ncentre energy E is related to the distribution function as\nF = (2E\/m2e)f .\nFirst, consider a \u201cquiet\u201d time period between 20:16:22\nand 20:16:23 UT when the electron flux in each channel\nis approximately constant. Fitting four points (opened cir-\ncles in Fig. 10) from the velocity space by the function\n(52) yields the following parameters: ne = 1.6 \u00b7 106 m\u22123,\nuo = 106 km s\u22121, T = 18.5 eV (2.15 \u00b7 105 K) (solid line\nin the Fig. 10). Second, consider the observations around\n\u223c 20:16:21.6 (Fig. 1b) when the particle detector which was\npointed upward recorded a significant enhancement of the\nelectron fluxes. The electron fluxes measured at that mo-\nment carry information about the distribution function of the\nwarm population near with the upper boundary of the ac-\nceleration region. According to the Fig. 9a electrons with\nvelocities 3.6 \u00b7 106 m s\u22121 and 5.1 \u00b7 106 m s\u22121 observed at\nthe altitude 2550 km had the velocities \u223c 3.15 \u00b7 106 m s\u22121\nand \u223c 4.8 \u00b7 106 m s\u22121, respectively, at the altitude 3070 km.\nFig. 10\nFig. 10. Values of the background electron distribution function\nmeasured by the electrostatic analyser into the two energetic chan-\nnels with central energies 37 and 74 eV between 20:16:22 and\n20:16:23 UT (open circles); together with the reconstructed dis-\ntribution function of the warm electron population: (i) background\npopulation with n = 1.6\u00b7106 m\u22123, uo = 106 km s\u22121, T = 18.5 eV\n(solid line); (ii) values of the distribution function near the upper\nboundary of the acceleration region (filled circles).\nTherefore the distribution function of the warm population\nnear the upper boundary of the acceleration region may be\nreconstructed by making the corresponding shift of the mea-\nsured distribution function in the velocity space. The result-\ning values of the distribution function, shown by the filled cir-\ncles in the Fig. 10, demonstrate that parameters (density and\ntemperature) of the warm population at the 530 km above the\nspacecraft track were approximately the same as observed\nlocally.\nAnother important point that has to be mentioned here is\nthe particle content of the magnetospheric flux tube. Gen-\nerally speaking, a closed magnetic flux tube consists of two\npopulations: a cold one of ionospheric origin and a warm\none of magnetospheric origin. The exponential decrease of\nthe plasma density with altitude is essentially due to the cold\npopulation. At the altitudes where the FAST observations\nwere made and at least up to the upper boundary of the accel-\neration region the cold population has to be dominant to pro-\nvide a continuous increase of Alfve\u00b4n speed and consequently\nstrong parallel electric field. Flattening of the density profile\noccurs at the altitudes where the densities of cold and su-\nperthermal populations are comparable and the density pro-\nfile above these heights is defined by the warm population,\nwhich may be regarded as a constant in the first approxima-\ntion. The altitude of the density flattening corresponds to the\nmaximum of the Alfve\u00b4n speed and presumably occurs near\nto the upper boundary of the acceleration region.\nE. Kolesnikova et al.: Excitation of Alfve\u00b4n waves by modulated HF heating 67\n5 Conclusions\nIn the present paper we propose a quantitative scenario of the\nAlfve\u00b4n wave excitation by modulated HF heating of iono-\nsphere. The Alfve\u00b4n wave will be launched from the upper\nboundary of ionosphere whenever the following two condi-\ntions are simultaneously satisfied:\n(i) a significant part of HF wave energy is absorbed in iono-\nsphere;\n(ii) there exists a dc electric field in the layer of absorption.\nThe mechanism of Alfve\u00b4n wave excitation is as follows. The\nabsorbed part of the ordered energy of the HF wave is trans-\nformed into the heating of the absorption layer, which leads\nto local perturbation of the conductivity with the modulated\nfrequency. The dc electric field drives a primary current in\nthe heated layer which is closed by polarisation current flow-\ning in the ionosphere and by parallel current leaking into\nmagnetosphere. Perturbations of electric and magnetic fields,\nwhich are associated with the parallel current, propagate into\nthe magnetosphere in the form of an Alfve\u00b4n wave. The paral-\nlel electric field of the Alfve\u00b4n wave is significant in the region\nwhere the electron inertial length is of order of the transverse\nwavelength of the Alfve\u00b4n wave or larger and may effectively\naccelerate superthermal electrons downward into the iono-\nsphere.\nThe amplitude of the Alfve\u00b4n wave is essentially deter-\nmined by\n(i) the magnitude of the primary current, which is bigger\nwhen the electron density and dc electric field in the\nabsorption layer are larger;\n(ii) the mechanism of closure of primary current, which\ndepends on the matching between the ionospheric and\nmagnetospheric conductances;\n(iii) the amplitude of the parallel current, which is significant\nif the Hall conductance is large or if the Pedersen con-\nductance is comparable with the magnetospheric con-\nductance;\n(iv) the conditions at the ionosphere-magnetosphere bound-\nary;\n(v) the Alfve\u00b4n speed profile in magnetosphere.\nUnder the conditions of strong electron precipitation in\nthe ionosphere, which took place during the FAST obser-\nvations on 8 October 1998, the primary current caused by\nthe perturbation of the conductivity in the heated region\nis closed entirely by the parallel current. In such circum-\nstances the boundary conditions in the upper ionosphere are\nmost favourable for the launching of an Alfve\u00b4n wave: it is\nlaunched from the node in the potential gradient, which is\nproportional to the parallel current. Quantitative estimations\nobtained from this model are consistent with the FAST ob-\nservations, i.e.,\n(i) the amplitude of the transverse electric field is of the\norder of\u223c 1 mV m\u22121 compared to the\u223c 2\u22125 mV m\u22121\nfrom the FAST measurements;\n(ii) the parallel electric field with a magnitude of the or-\nder of \u223c 10\u22123 mV m\u22121 may effectively accelerate su-\nperthermal electrons downward into the ionosphere.\nAcknowledgements.
