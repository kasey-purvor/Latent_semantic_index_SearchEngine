This kind of design offers a solution to the intrinsic lack of damage tolerance of integral\nstructures. Due to the multiple and complex failure mechanisms of bonded structures, a comprehensive modelling\ntechnique is needed to evaluate important design parameters. In this Part I of a two-part paper, the actions and\nmechanisms involved in a bonded structure are discussed first, followed by presenting the modelling approaches to\nsimulate each mechanism. Delamination or disbond of the strap from the substrate is modelled by computing the\nstrain energy release rate on the disbond front and applying a fracture mechanics criterion. Thermal residual stresses\narising from the adhesive curing process and their redistribution with the substrate crack growth are calculated and\ntaken into account in the crack growth analysis. Secondary bending effect caused by the un-symmetric geometry of\none-sided strap is also modelled. In the classic linear elastic fracture mechanics, a non-dimensional stress intensity\nfactor, i.e. the geometry factor \u03b2, depends only on the sample\u2019s geometry. This \u03b2 factor cannot be found for this kind\nof bonded structures, since the magnitude of disbond is related to the applied stress and the disbond size modifies\nthe geometry of the structure. Moreover, secondary bending effect is geometric non-linear thus the stress intensity\nfactor cannot be normalised by the applied stress. For these reasons an alternative technique has been developed,\nwhich requires calculating the stress intensity factors at both the maximum and minimum applied stresses for each\ncrack length. This analysis technique is implemented in a computer program that interfaces with the NASTRAN\ncommercial code to compute the fatigue crack growth life of strap reinforced structures.\nKey words: bonded straps, selective reinforcements, fatigue crack growth life, thermal residual stress, delamination, disbond,\nsecondary bending, bonded patch repair.\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier 6 August 2009\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nNomenclature\na crack length\nE Young\u2019s modulus\nFs constraint force at crack-tip\nGIF , GIM strain energy release rate (mode I) due to traction and bending\nGItot , GImean total and mean through-thickness strain energy release rate (mode I)\nKIF , KIM stress intensity factors due to traction and bending\nKIRMS , KIW root-mean-square and weighted through-thickness average stress intensity factors\nKapp, Kres, Ktot stress intensity factors due to applied, residual, and combined stress fields\nTC , TR, To curing, room and stress-free temperatures\nta, tr, ts thickness of adhesive, reinforcement strap, and substrate\n\u03b1r, \u03b1s coefficients of thermal expansion of reinforcement strap and substrate\n\u03b2 non-dimensional stress intensity factor\n\u03c3ys yield strength\nSubscripts\na adhesive\nr reinforcement strap\ns substrate\nW weighted function solution\nRMS root-mean-square solution\nAbbreviations\nCFRP carbon fibre reinforced plastics\nCTE coefficient of thermal expansion\nFCG fatigue crack growth\nFML fibre-metal laminate\nGFRP glass fibre reinforced plastics\nLEFM linear elastic fracture mechanics\nMVCCT modified virtual crack closure technique\nSENT single edge notch tension (test sample)\nSERR strain energy release rate\nSIF stress intensity factor\nTRS thermal residual stress\nUD unidirectional\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

Introduction\nIntegral structures fabricated by machining or welding rather than riveting are very attractive in terms of\nreduced structural weight and manufacturing cost [1\u20133]. However, such structures lack the fail safety capa-\nbility due to the absence of attached stringers or frames. One promising solution to overcome this problem\nis to use selective reinforcement or bonded straps [4\u201311] (see Figure 1). Previous work has concluded that\nthese straps provide significant benefit in terms of reduced crack growth rates and improved fail safety.\nHeinimann et al. [5] tested different strap configurations and materials, such as the GLARE-1 (glass fibre\npolymer based fibre metal laminate), aluminium 7075-T762, and carbon fibre polymer based fibre metal\nlaminate, on aluminum substrates and obtained encouraging results in terms of much retarded crack growth\nrates. For example, wide panels with bonded GLARE straps were tested. Straps were stretched prior to\nbonding to reverse the thermal residual stresses in the substrate from tension to compression. The thinnest\ntest panels had the largest reinforcement volume fraction (28%) and achieved an average fatigue life im-\nprovement of more than 300%. Other test were carried out on aluminum panels reinforced by GLARE or\nunidirectional (UD) carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) based fiber metal laminate (FML). Tensile\nresidual stresses were reduced by pinning the grip ends of the substrate and straps during the cure process.\nConsequently fatigue crack growth (FCG) life was increased significatively. Colavita et al. [7] and Bowler\n[8] conducted tests and finite element modelling of CFRP straps on aluminium plates. They showed that\ncuring adhesives at elevated temperature could actually reduce the fatigue life of strapped integral structures\ncompared to the un-reinforced case due to the adverse effect of thermal residual stresses (TRS).\nHowever, it is both time consuming and expensive to conduct physical tests at the design stage on a wide\nrange of strap parameters. For the design process, analysis tools and simulation models are required. Zhang\nand Li [6] used the finite element method (FEM) to model the behaviour of integral skin-stringer panels\nreinforced by straps made of either UD CFRP or Ti-6Al-4V alloy. A strength-based adhesive failure crite-\nrion was used. Based on the numerical simulation, FCG life was significantly improved by both types of\nstraps. Strap bridging effect was identified as the main mechanism for crack growth retardation. Boscolo\net al. [9] presented a modelling technique based on fracture mechanics to study reinforced plates cured at\nroom temperature. The methodology was validated against test results and the effect of the strap material\n(elastic modulus), dimension, and position were examined against the added structural weight and FCG\nlife improvement. It was found that if the adhesive is tough enough and cured at room temperature, the\nstiffness of the strap, which depends on the dimension and material elastic modulus, is the most important\n3\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nparameter for FCG life improvement. In addition, a project graph was proposed as a design tool to find the\nlightest strap to achieve a prescribed life improvement target. In [10,11], Zhang et al. studied different strap\nmaterials which were tested on mid-crack tension, M(T), and single edge notch tension, SENT, specimens.\nThe substrates were made of aluminium alloy 2024-T351 or 7085-T7651. The bonded straps were made of\nfour different materials, i.e. CFRP, GFRP, GLARE, and Ti-6V-4Al (Ti-6-4). Adhesives were cured at either\nthe room or elevated temperatures to investigate the effect of thermal residual stresses. The extent of crack\nretardation benefits, in terms of fatigue crack growth life improvement, was established by both numerical\nsimulation and experimental tests. An effective modelling technique was developed to compute the TRS in\nthe substrate and their effect on the FCG life. However, the effects of secondary bending and non-uniform\nthrough-thickness crack profile due to the un-symmetric configuration of one-side strap was neglected.\nThe objective of the work reported in this paper is to further develop the modelling technique by im-\nplementing all known mechanisms, which include the positive crack bridging effect and adverse effects by\nstrap disbond failure, secondary bending, and curing at elevated temperature. Section 2 summarises all\nmechanisms involved in bonded strap reinforced structures; section 3 presents the modelling technique de-\nvelopment to take into account of all interactive mechanisms; finally FCG life prediction is reported in\nsection 4. Validation of this modelling technique and demonstration examples are reported in [12].\n2. Mechanisms working in bonded structures\nFailure mechanisms involved in a hybrid structure are complex with multiple failure modes and many\ninfluential factors that also interact each other. Figure 1 shows a metallic integral skin-stringer panel (sub-\nstrate) reinforced by bonded composite material straps. Under cyclic loads, four possible failure modes are\nidentified, i.e. initiation and growth of a lead crack in the substrate, disbond failure in the adhesive interface,\ndelamination damage in composite straps due to free-edge effect or impacts, and cracking in the straps due\nto notch effect. In order to model these failure modes and predict FCG life of reinforced structures, four\nmechanisms should be simulated.\n\u2013 Strap stiffening and bridging effect\nThis is the only positive mechanism. The stiffening\/bridging action reduces crack growth rates. Before the\nsubstrate crack enters the strap region, the strap is already effective that acts like a \u201cstiffener\u201dtaking and\ntransferring part of the load from the cracked substrate. This is the so-called stiffening effect. When the\nsubstrate crack enters and passes the strapped region, the traction forces exerted by the strap decrease\n4\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nthe crack opening displacement and reduce the crack tip stress intensity factor; this action is called crack\nbridging. The scenario is shown in Figure 2.\n\u2013 Disbond failure\nThe passing of the lead crack under a strap promotes disbond in the bonding interface. Progressive disbond\nfailure will reduce the effectiveness of strap bridging effect.\n\u2013 Secondary bending\nDue to the unsymmetrical configuration of one-side strap, secondary bending is generated at the applica-\ntion of external load. This causes the substrate to bend towards the reinforced side producing higher tensile\nstresses at the un-reinforced side; consequently, different crack growth rates and curved through-thickness\ncrack front are observed.\n\u2013 Thermal residual stresses\nThese arise from elevated temperature cure of adhesive bonds and are due to the difference in the co-\nefficients of thermal expansion of the two adherends. For the strap materials used in this work, tensile\nstresses are produced in the substrate causing increased crack growth rates. TRS also causes secondary\nbending due to unsymmetrical configuration.\nThese mechanisms, their effects on FCG rates, and the influential parameters are summarised in Table 1.\nBoth the external load and TRS cause secondary bending, but in opposite directions. Secondary bending\nproduces strong geometric nonlinear effect. Therefore, crack tip stress intensity factors due to the mechanical\nand thermal stresses cannot be simply summed together; both stresses must be considered simultaneously in\none nonlinear FE analysis to determine the overall bending direction and magnitude for each crack length.\n3. Modelling technique\n3.1. Two-layer-plus-spring model\n3D FE models are able to take account of all 3-dimensional actions present in the problem, but they\nare time and resource consuming. Moreover, the very thin adhesive layer leads to either element aspect\nratio problem or extremely fine mesh, which will require even more computational effort. On the other\nhand, conventional 2D FE models take much less computing time, but it is more difficult to consider the\n3D effects, such as the secondary bending and non-uniform crack profiles. Therefore a novel and enhanced\n2D FE model has been developed to study bonded crack retarders taking into account of aforementioned\n5\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nmechanisms and failure modes.\nThe modelling technique employs 2D plate elements for the substrate and 2D laminate or plate elements for\nstraps made of composite or metallic. Adhesive is modelled by two rigid elements to represent the adhesive\nlayer thickness and three coincident spring elements to mimic the interlaminar peeling and shear actions.\nThis adhesive model was developed by Tahmasebi [13] for analysis of bonded joints and it is used in this\nwork to simulate the behaviour of the bond interface (see Figure 3). The stiffness of the spring elements\n(Ka z, Ka x, and Ka y) along the three directions can be calculated by the following equations:\nKa z =\nAa Ea\nta\n, Ka x = Ka y =\nAa Ga\nta\n(1)\nwhere Aa is the area of the adhesive element (Figure 4), Ea the adhesive elastic modulus, Ga the adhesive\nshear modulus, and ta the adhesive thickness.\nIn order to implement the displacement continuity through the thickness, this model makes use of the multi-\npoint constraint (MPC) equations. Based on the Mindlin [14] plate theory the ith-nodal displacements for a\nplate element can be written as:\nu(z)i = uoi + z\u03c6\ny\ni , v(z)i = v\no\ni \u2212 z\u03c6xi , w(z)i = woi (2)\nwhere uoi , v\no\ni and w\no\ni are the membrane nodal displacements in the x, y, and z direction, respectively, \u03c6\ny\ni\nnodal rotation around y-direction, and \u03c6xi nodal rotation around x-direction. Assign subscript s to the\ndisplacement of the nodes that belong to the substrate and need to be connected to the adhesive, a1 to the\nnodes on the bottom of the adhesive, a2 to the nodes on the top of the adhesive, and r to the nodes that\nbelong to the reinforcement strap (see Figure 3), the MPC equations can be written as:\nuoa1 = u\no\ns +\nts\n2\n\u03c6ys , v\no\na1 = v\no\ns \u2212\nts\n2\n\u03c6xs , w\no\na1 = w\no\ns\nuoa2 = u\no\nr \u2212\ntr\n2\n\u03c6yr , v\no\na2 = v\no\nr +\ntr\n2\n\u03c6xr , w\no\na2 = w\no\nr\n(3)\nwhere the subscripts s, a1, a2, r indicate the plane to which the nodes belong (see Figures 3 and 6), ts and\ntr are the thickness of substrate and reinforcement strap, respectively.\nTherefore, the 3D effect can be taken into account and the effects of secondary bending, thermal residual\nstresses and disbond progression can be computed by using this computational efficient 2D model. Geometric\nnon-linear analysis can also be performed by this model.\n6\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n3.2. Stress intensity factors with secondary bending effect\nLinear elastic fracture mechanics is used to calculate the principal parameters that govern the fracture\nfailure. Through the FE analysis and the modified virtual crack closure technique (MVCCT) [15\u201317], strain\nenergy release rate 2 (noted as SERR or G) can be computed for the lead crack in the substrate. In the\nabsence of bending, following equation is used:\nGI = \u2212 12\u2206atsF\ny\ns \u2206vs = \u2212\n1\n\u2206ats\nF ys vs (4)\nwhere, \u2206a is the crack length increment, ts the substrate thickness, F ys the constraint force at the crack\ntip node, and vs the displacement at the node immediately behind the crack tip (see figure 5(a)). From the\nSERR the SIF can be computed by:\nKI =\n\u221a\nGIE\u2217s (5)\nwhere\nE\u2217s = Es (plane stress)\nE\u2217s =\nEs\n1\u2212 \u03bd2s\n(plane strain)\n(6)\nand Es is the elastic modulus of the substrate material. The plane strain condition is defined by the ASTM\nstandards [18] as:\nts \u2265 2.5\n(\nKI\n\u03c3ys\n)2\n(7)\nDue to the secondary bending, a rotation and a constraint moment exist in the substrate (see figure 5(b)),\nconsequently, stress intensity factor (SIF) of the main crack varies along the substrate thickness. Methods\nto obtain the SIF along the crack front for each crack length have been developed for patch repair problems.\nWang and Rose[19\u201321] showed that a distribution of SIF along the crack front cannot be obtained by\ncalculating the strain energy release rates. They argued that, from an energy point of view, only the total\nenergy can be computed (GI) from the two components of the SERR, one due to traction (GIF ) and the\nother one due to bending (GIM ). Applying the MVCCT the total SERR is:\nGItot = GIF + GIM = \u2212\n1\n\u2206ats\n(\nF ys v\n0\ns + M\nx\ns \u03c6\nx\ns\n)\n(8)\nwhere, v0s and \u03c6\nx\ns are nodal displacement and rotation, F\ny\ns and M\nx\ns nodal constraint force and moment, ts\nthe thickness of substrate, and \u2206a the crack extension size necessary to apply MVCCT (see Figure 5(b)).\n2 Since this subsection concerns the substrate only, for clarity, subscript (s) is omitted for SERR (G) and SIF (K).\n7\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFrom the total strain energy release rate, only the root mean square (RMS) value of the SIF (KIRMS ) can\nbe calculated:\nKIRMS =\n\u221a\nGItotE\n\u2217\ns (9)\nSun et al. [22\u201325] used a different approach and calculated the two SIF components from the corresponding\nSERR components (GIF and GIM , see Equation 8):\nKIF =\n\u221a\nGIF E\n\u2217 , KIM =\n\u221a\n3GIME\u2217 (10)\nThey then assumed a linear distribution of SIF along the crack front (through the thickness) and obtained:\nKI(z) = KIF +\n2z\nt\nKIM (11)\nThus, a distribution of SIF along the crack front can be calculated by the energy method and, according to\ntheir assumption, the distribution is linear.\nThe method developed in this work is different from the aforementioned two approaches. Here we attempt\nto demonstrate that a distribution of the SERR and SIF along the crack front can be calculated by using\nthe Mindlin plate theory (Equation 2) to obtain the constraint force Fs(z) and displacement vs(z) variations\nalong the crack front (see Figure 5(b)):\nvs(z) = v0s \u2212 z\u03c6xs , Fs(z) = F ys \u2212 z\n12Mxs\nt2s\n(12)\nSubstituting equation 12 in 4, the SERR distribution through the thickness can be obtained:\nGI(z) = \u2212 1\u2206atsFs(z)vs(z) = \u2212\n12Mxs \u03c6\nx\ns\n\u2206at3s\nz2 +\n(\n12Mxs v\n0\ns\n\u2206at3s\n+\n\u03c6xsF\ny\ns\n\u2206ats\n)\nz \u2212 F\ny\ns v\n0\ns\n\u2206ats\n(13)\nnow SIF can be computed by sing the following equation:\nKI(z) =\n\u221a\nGI(z)E\u2217 =\n\u221a[\n\u221212M\nx\ns \u03c6\nx\ns\n\u2206at3s\nz2 +\n(\n12Mxs v0s\n\u2206at3s\n+\n\u03c6xsF\ny\ns\n\u2206ats\n)\nz \u2212 F\ny\ns v0s\n\u2206ats\n]\nE\u2217 (14)\nThis leads to a parabolic distribution of SERR along the crack front; thus SIF is a square root of the\nparabola.\nIt is worth noting that the mean value of the SERR through the thickness (GImean), that can be computed\n8\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nfrom equation 13, is actually equal to the total SERR (GItot) that was calculated by Wang and Rose in\nequation 8:\nGImean =\n1\nts\n\u222b ts\n2\n\u2212 ts2\nGI(z)dz = \u2212 1\u2206ats (F\ny\ns v\no\ns + M\nx\ns \u03c6\nx\ns ) = GItot (15)\nMoreover, it can be shown that by using the total or mean SERR in equation 5 and making use of equation\n15, the RMS value of the SIF is obtained:\nKI =\n\u221a\nGItotE\n\u2217 =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1\nts\n\u222b ts\n2\n\u2212 ts2\nGI(z)E\u2217dz =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1\nts\n\u222b ts\n2\n\u2212 ts2\nKI(z)2dz = KIRMS (16)\nThis means that the RMS SIF has an actual physic meaning, i.e. it is the SIF obtained from the total (or\nthrough-thickness mean) SERR. Furthermore, if equations 8 and 10 are substituted into equation 11 the\nfollowing expression is obtained:\nKI =\n\u221a\n\u2212F\ny\ns v0s\n\u2206ats\nE\u2217 +\n\u221a\n\u221212M\nx\ns \u03c6\nx\ns\n\u2206at3s\nz2E\u2217 (17)\nComparing equations 17 and 14 it can be seen that these two expressions are not identical and the second\ncannot be reduced to the first. Although the equations are symbolically different, the difference between the\ntwo is close to zero if real case SIF values are calculated by these equations. This proves that the distribution\nof SERR through the thickness as defined in equation 13 is correct and the SIF distribution through the\nthickness is almost linear as it should be in order to be consistent with the Mindlin plate theory.\nThis methodology for calculating the SIF along the crack front was firstly validated by the authors in\n[26] against 3D FE models for patch repair problems. It was subsequently applied to bonded crack retarder\nstraps with other modelling features described in the following sections and validated in the second part of\nthe this paper [12].\n3.3. Disbond failure modelling\nIn this work disbond growth is modelled interactively with the growing crack in substrate. In most of\nthe papers in the open literature on selective reinforcement or patch repair problems, disbond is either\nnot considered [19\u201321,27,28] or modelled based on prescribed disbond shape and size as a function of the\nsubstrate crack length based on experimental observations [7,23\u201325].\nFor laminated composites and adhesive joints, empirical laws have been developed to study delamination\ngrowth under fatigue loads. These laws link the disbond growth rate dl\/dN to the SERR range (\u2206G) using\n9\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nexperimentally correlated material constants, e.g. [29\u201335]. These laws can be written in a generic form as:\ndl\ndN\n= f(\u2206G) (18)\nFor example, a simple law was developed by Alderliesten et al. [31], in which the effect of cyclic stress ratio\nand mixed mode delamination is neglected and only the Paris law region is studied. This law has been proved\nto be adequate to model delamination damages in the fibre-metal laminate GLARE. More complicated laws\nhave been developed for different adhesives and adherends. For example, Kinloch and Taylor [33] have\nincluded the near threshold and critical SERR in their disbond model. Andersons et al. [32] studied the\ncyclic stress ratio effect. Kardomateaset et al. [34] considered mixed mode loading, and to the authors\u2019 best\nknowledge, Shivakumar et al. [35] developed the most complete law to include all aforementioned effects in\na single equation.\nOnce a material law of disbond growth is chosen and the material constants are known, the next task is to\ncompute the SERR range at the disbond front and integrate the material law to obtain the disbond growth\nlife [33,34]. However, there are limitations in these laws. First, database of material constants for currently\nused adhesives is not available and the sensitivity of these constants to the analysis result is unknown;\nconsequently all those laws can only be used for the adhesive and adherends that they were specifically\ndeveloped for. Second, none of them can deal with disbond initiation. In fact, to predict the fatigue life of an\nadhesive joint, the critical SERR value for the onset of disbond initiation as function of cycle numbers [36]\nmust be known; otherwise an initial disbond damage is assumed to exist in the model and over-conservative\nprediction could be obtained [33]. Thirdly, these Paris law type equations were obtained from tests under\nsingle mode load conditions, whereas for the bonded crack retarder problem disbond usually propagates\nunder mixed mode load. Therefore, although there have been some success in modelling adhesively-bonded\njoints, these empirical laws are not yet ready for modelling bond strap reinforced structures.\nA different approach to model delamination growth was developed by Xie [37,38]. A special finite element\nconsisting of two 8-noded plate elements and three spring elements was implemented into the ABAQUS FE\nsoftware. SERR was calculated by the modified virtual crack closure technique (MVCCT) inside the special\nelement and the springs of this element will be deleted when a mixed mode failure criterion was satisfied.\nTherefore a moving delamination front can be modelled using a fixed mesh.\nIn the modelling technique presented in this paper disbond growth is modelled by the same idea of Xie\u2019s\n[37,38]. Through the MVCCT, three components of the SERR are computed on the disbond front keeping\nmemory of the direction of propagation for each fracture mode (I, II, III):\n10\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nGI = \u2212Faz (wa2 \u2212 wa1)2\u2206lba , GII = \u2212\nFay (va2 \u2212 va1)\n2\u2206lba\n, GIII = \u2212Fax (ua2 \u2212 ua1)2\u2206lba (19)\nwhere, Faz, Fay, Fax are the forces in the springs, w, v, u the displacements of the nodes immediately behind\nthe crack tip, and \u2206l ba the area of crack extension by which the crack-tip nodes were released to computed\nthe SERR (see figure 6). Using a mixed mode failure criterion (equation 20), failing elements in the adhesive\nlayer are identified and deleted from the FE model to simulate adhesive disbond growth.\nGI\nGIC\n+\nGII\nGIIC\n\u2265 1 (20)\nwhere, GIC and GIIC are critical strain energy release rates for mode I and mode II [37,39,40].\nIf any adhesive element has failed, then the disbond front will be updated and another FE analysis is followed\nto compute the SERR along the new disbond front and, again, the failing adhesive elements will be delated.\nThis interactive analysis goes on until no spring elements fail, i.e. the final disbond shape is found for the\ngiven substrate crack length. This method could be called a \u201cquasi-static\u201d delamination growth analysis,\nsince it does not model the effect of fatigue loads. It must be said, though, that disbond growth in patch\nrepair and bonded crack retarders is mostly due to the high local stresses in the substrate crack tip region\ndue to the \u201cstress singularity\u201d effect rather than fatigue loads. This modelling technique has been validated\nagainst experimental tests [9,11].\n3.4. Computation of thermal residual stresses (TRS)\nFirst, it is necessary to understand how these TRS are generated. In the case of two plates bonded at\nelevated temperature, the two adherends become bonded when the adhesive is completely polymerised at\nthe curing temperature TC . This temperature is usually referred to as the stress free temperature TC = To,\nsince before reaching the temperature the two adherends are still free to expand and slide over each other.\nWhen the assembly is cooled down to room temperature TR (i.e. the test temperature), the two adherends\nwill try to contract to the original size, but displacement compatibility has to be maintained at the bonding\ninterface. If the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) are different for the two adherends, they will contract\nat different rate during the temperature drop and that generates the TRS.\nFor an assembly made of two different isotropic adherends of the same dimensions, the beam theory can be\nused to derive a closed form solution of TRS (\u03c3res) in the substrate [41]:\n\u03c3res =\ntrErEs (\u03b1r \u2212 \u03b1s)\u2206T\ntrEr + tsEs\n(21)\n11\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nwhere, \u2206T = TR\u2212To is the difference between the final room temperature (TR) and the stress-free temper-\nature (To) or the cure temperature (TC). Analytical solution for TRS have been found also for double-sided\northotropic circular reinforcement bonded to infinite or circular isotropic substrates by Wang et al. [42] by\nmaking use of the inclusion method. An analytical solution for one-sided composite repairs has also been\nfound by Wang and Erjavec [43]. This solution takes into account of the bending caused by the TRS. Al-\nthough these equations are very useful for understanding the influential parameters and for quickly finding\nvalues of TRS, FE analyses are necessary for more complex geometries. Furthermore, TRS redistribution\nwith crack propagation and coupling between TRS and applied mechanical load in terms of secondary bend-\ning (to be further explained in section 4.1) cannot be accounted for without the use of FEM.\nAnother attempt in accounting for the thermal residual stress effect on FCG life for patched plates was\nmade by Lena et al. [44] by using the modelling technique developed by Sun et al. [22\u201325]. In their study the\neffective curing temperature was found by using different trial temperatures in the FE models to compute\ndifferent trial FCG lives. The computed lives were compared to the life of a sample test and the effective\ncuring temperature was assumed to be the one which produced the smallest difference with the experimental\nresults. Obviously, this assessing procedure would cancel any possible inaccuracy in the SIF computed by\nFEM and absorb the test scatter. They found that, although the curing temperature of the adhesive was\n120\u25e6C, the effective temperature which would cause the FCG prediction to be close to the test result was\n62\u25e6C. Moreover, the effect of the residual SIF was considered to increase the maximum applied SIF instead\nof influencing the R-ratio (see end of section II in [44]) as it is done in the literature [45\u201347] and reported\nin section 4.1. This approximation, known by Lena et al. [44] was necessary since a material law for the\nsubstrate at different R-ratios (as the one reported in the second part of the paper [12]) was unavailable.\nIn this study, thermal load FE analyses was performed for each strap configuration by inputting a temper-\nature drop equal to the room temperature (TR) minus the cure temperature (TC):\n\u2206T = TR \u2212 TC (22)\nCare should be taken in modelling the curing process and residual stress redistribution during crack prop-\nagation for two reasons. First, thermal and mechanical stresses must be applied simultaneously for reasons\nto be explained in section 4.1. Second, to perform the mechanical load analysis the FE model must be sup-\nported as it is in the fatigue testing. However, if the thermal load analysis is conducted under this boundary\ncondition, thermal residual stresses (TRS) will be generated in the support boundaries of the substrate, i.e.\nwhere the specimen is clamped. These TRS are not physically there, since the substrate and reinforcement\n12\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nstrap have already reached the equilibrium condition at the end of the curing process without being fitted on\nto the test machine. In order not to generate these unrealistic TRS, it is necessary to calculate the equivalent\nCTE for the reinforcement (\u03b1\u2217r) and substrate (\u03b1\n\u2217\ns) as follows:\n\u03b1\u2217r = \u03b1r \u2212 \u03b1s , \u03b1\u2217s = \u03b1s \u2212 \u03b1s = 0 (23)\nTherefore the substrate does not get unrealistic deformation, and the relative difference in the CTE between\nthe substrate and reinforcement is the same and the effect of temperature can be taken into account without\nthe influence of boundary conditions. Moreover, the temperature drop will be kept there for each crack\nlength and in this way the redistribution of TRS with a growing crack can be modelled. This modelling\ntechnique is validated against test results in [12].\nIn this study the substrate is made of an aluminium alloy and the straps are made of one of the following\nmaterials: CFRP, GFRP, Ti-6A-4V, and GLARE. In each case the CTE of the reinforcement material (\u03b1r)\nis smaller than that of the substrate (\u03b1s). This difference causes tensile residual stresses in the substrate\nthat promotes crack opening, thus crack propagation.\n4. Computing fatigue crack growth life\nTwo modelling challenges arise for bonded structures. The first is caused by geometric non-linearity of\none-side strap configuration, the other is due to the fact that although a distribution of SIF along the crack\nfront can be obtained by aforementioned 2D method, only one SIF value is needed for each crack profile for\ncalculating the FCG rate and life.\n4.1. Geometric nonlinearity and alternate analysis method\nGeometric nonlinearity effect arises due to the unsymmetrical configuration. Secondary bending presents\non application of the mechanical and thermal loads, which leads to nonlinear force-displacement relation.\nIn the linear elastic case, to compute the SIF range only one FE analysis is needed for each crack length,\nfor example at the maximum load. Then from the stress ratio R = \u03c3min\/\u03c3max, SIF at the minimum load\nKmin = RKmax and SIF range \u2206K = (1\u2212 R)Kmax can be found. This cannot be done when the problem\nis geometrically nonlinear because:\nR =\nKmin\nKmax\n\u0003= \u03c3min\n\u03c3max\nand\nKapp\n\u03c3app\n\u0003= Kmax\n\u03c3max\n\u0003= Kmin\n\u03c3min\n(24)\n13\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nThis means that a normalised or non-dimensional SIF (the geometry factor \u03b2 ) does not exist due to the\nnonlinearity effect.\nIn this study this problem is solved by performing a so-called \u201calternate analysis\u201dof the SIF at the maximum\nand minimum applied stresses; thus Ktotmax and K\ntot\nmin are calculated for the cyclic maximum and minimum\nstresses. This leads to an effective R ratio, which is different from the nominal stress ratio, and an effective\nSIF range \u2206K that is different from the calculation result by the classic LEFM superposition rule. This\nalternate analysis was applied by the authors for a composite patch repair problem [26].\nIn the presence of TRS the problem is more complicated, since the TRS also cause secondary bending. Due\nto the nonlinearity of the problem and coupling effect, the applied stress intensity factor (Kapp) and residual\nstress intensity factor (Kres) cannot be simply superimposed (figure 7(a)), i.e.:\nKapp+res \u0003= Kapp + Kres (25)\nThus the classic superposition method [46] used to deal with most other residual stress problems (e.g.\nwelding, cold-working) cannot be used. For example, in welded joints, the superposition method results in\nthat \u2206K is unaffected by the presence of TRS but the effective R ratio will change.\nThe total SIF (Ktot) that includes the interaction between the mechanically applied and thermal residual\nstresses (figure 7(b)) must be computed at the maximum and minimum applied load separately, which is\nreferred to as the \u201dalternate analysis\u201d in this work. Thus, the SIF range (\u2206K) and effective (R) ratio can\nbe calculated as:\n\u2206K = Ktotmax \u2212Ktotmin and R =\nKtotmin\nKtotmax\n\u0003= \u03c3min\n\u03c3max\n(26)\nThe magnitude of the interaction between mechanical and thermal stress fields is shown in the second part\nof this paper [12].\n4.2. Thickness effect and equivalent SIF\nAlthough the through-thickness distribution of SIF along the crack tip front can be found by equation\n14, only one SIF value is required for each crack profile in a crack growth law. Good candidates included\nthe mean, the maximum and RMS values. The RMS is directly connected to the total strain energy release\nrate [20]), and Sun et al. [25] showed that the best agreement with test results was obtained using the RMS\nvalue. The maximum SIF, i.e. the SIF on the un-reinforced side, could give too conservative life prediction,\nsince the interaction with other SIF values through the thickness is neglected.\n14\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nDuong and Wang [48] has shown that an over conservative life prediction was obtained by using the maxi-\nmum SIF, but the RMS value can overestimate the FCG life. They found that for a low bending component\nthe FCG life can be better predicted by Kmax, whereas for higher bending moments the KRMS is a better\nparameter. Thus an equivalent SIF was proposed as a function of a non-dimensional parameter that repre-\nsents the repair patch stiffness ratio [48].\nHosseini-Toudeshky and Mohammadi [49] conducted two 3D FE analyses of curved and straight crack fronts.\nThey found that the FCG life can be computed by the simpler 3D FE model with straight crack front (which\nis equivalent to a 2D FE model where the through thickness distribution of SIF is computed) using an equiv-\nalent SIF, which, for each crack length, is a value of SIF in a position along the sample\u2019s thickness that\ndepends on the elastic modulus of the plate and repair patch as well as the plate thickness. That position\nwas found to be between 0.32 \u223c 0.37 of the plate thickness from the un-patched side.\nIn a similar way, a weight function is developed in this work to take account of the fact that the crack length\nat the un-reinforced side is dragged back by all other shorter crack lengths, and vice versa for the crack\nlength at the reinforced side. This weight function is based on the argument that the crack front, which\nby a 2D model has to be a straight line, is actually parabolic [27,28,49]. This 3D effect can be considered\nby a suitable weight function. Imposing the parabola vertex at the un-reinforced side with the value of 1\nand prescribing the value on the reinforced side as 0, a weight function (W (z)) is obtained to describe the\nparabola:\nW (z) = \u2212 1\nt2s\nz2 \u2212 1\nts\nz +\n3\n4\n(\n\u2212 ts\n2\n\u2264 z \u2264 ts\n2\n)\n(27)\nUsing the weight function (Equation 27) and SERR distribution through the thickness (Equation 13), a\nweighted SERR (GIW ) can be computed:\nGIW =\n\u222b ts\/2\n\u2212ts\/2 W (z)GI(z)dz\u222b ts\/2\n\u2212ts\/2 W (z)dz\n= \u2212 9\n10\nM0\u03c6\n\u2206at\n\u2212 1\n8\n(\n12M0v0\n\u2206at2\n+\n\u03c6F 0\n\u2206a\n)\n\u2212 F\n0v0\n\u2206at\n(28)\nSimilarly, using Equations 14 and 27, a weighed SIF (KIW ) can be calculated.\n4.3. Life prediction\nFatigue crack growth rates and lives are predicted by using a material law in terms of the crack growth\nrate vs. the SIF range at different R-ratios. These curves can be expressed by either an empirical equation,\ne.g the Paris\u2019 law or NASGRO equation, or on point-by-point basis in tabular data form. They are the\n15\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nmaterial property, albeit suffer from certain scatters. If no material coefficients are available, then the point-\nby-point described curves ought to be used. In this case it is necessary to obtain at least two experimentally\nmeasured crack growth rate curves for two different R-ratios. Therefore the curves for other R-ratios can be\nobtained by the Harter T-method [50]. These curves are numerically integrated with the calculated stress\nintensity factor range (\u2206K) and effective (R) ratio as a function of the crack length (a) for each study\ncase to compute the fatigue crack growth (FCG) life. The computer code AFGROW [50] cannot be used to\ncompute the FCG life of this kind of structures, since the effective R ratio cannot be input as a function\nof the crack length into the code. The way that AFGROW deals with residual stress effect is by inputting\nthe residual stress field first and then calculating the residual stress intensity factors by either the Gaussian\nintegration or a weight function and then use the superposition method to determine the effective R ratio\nwithin the code. As mentioned in section 4.1 and demonstrated in the second part of the paper [12], for\none-side bonded structures, the mechanical and thermal residual stress fields interact each other to produce\nthe so-called effective SIF range and effective R ratio; hence both stress fields must be considered together\nto deliver the effective SIF and R ratio values for each crack length.\nFor this reason a computer subroutine that takes the calculated \u2206K, R and a as input data has been\nimplemented in the main computer code described in the next section.\n4.4. Computer code\nA computer program interfacing the commercial package MSC\/NASTRAN has been developed to imple-\nment the aforementioned analysis techniques and model the failures in bonded strap reinforced structures.\nFirst, the SIF values along the thickness for each crack length at the maximum and minimum applied load\nare calculated. Second, the RMS and weighted SIF values are calculated through the thickness. Third, the\nSIF range and effective R-ratio under cyclic loads are calculated for the two equivalent mean SIF values\n(RMS and weighted). Finally, FCG rate and life are calculated by integrating a cooresponding material\ncrack growth law. The integration is carried out by using the Runge-Kutta algorithm [51] of the fifth order.\nThe computer program flow chart diagram can be found in [9].\n5. Concluding remarks\nA modelling technique has been developed that takes into account of all known mechanisms that affect\nthe fatigue crack growth life of bonded strap reinforced structures. Main modelling features are summarised\n16\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nbelow.\n(1) Adhesive disbond and progressive failure growth are modelled throughout the life of the lead crack in\nthe substrate. (2) Effect of thermal residual stresses and their redistribution due to crack growth are taken\ninto account in calculating the stress intensity factors. (3) Effect of secondary bending under mechanical\nand thermal stresses on the through-thickness SIF distribution is calculated by the enhanced 2D FE model.\nAverage through-thickness SIF value is determined by a parabolic weight function to model a curved crack\nfront in thick substrate. (4) Geometric nonlinearity under cyclic loads is dealt with by the \u201calternate analysis\u201d\nmethod that takes into account also the nonlinear interaction between the mechanical and thermal stresses.\n(5) A computer program is developed for predicting fatigue crack growth life by numerical integration using\none of the following empirical laws: the NASGRO equation, the Harter T-method, or tabular crack growth\nrates data.\nThis modelling methodology is validated by test results of various configurations and strap materials, which\nis reported in the second part of the paper [12] .\nAcknowledgements.
