Therefore, these materials\nmay have application in visible displays or in white light\nsystems that employ color-combining techniques. Recently,\nrare earth doped GaN and AlN thin films have also shown\npotential impact for application in spintronics.15\u201319 Whereas\ndoping of GaN crystals with Eu atoms to a few atomic per-\ncent has led to observations of weak ferromagnetic\nbehavior,15 doping with Gd atoms to less than 1 at. % has\nproduced extremely large magnetic moments per ion at room\ntemperature.17 These reports of colossal magnetic moments\nwith Curie temperatures above 400 K in Gd-doped GaN\n\u0001GaN:Gd\u0002 thin films have sparked interest in exploring other\nrare-earth\u2013nitride systems as candidate materials for spin-\ntronic devices. The doping of nitrides with rare earth ions\nmay serve as an alternative to transition metal doping with\nthe possibility of room temperature ferromagnetism medi-\nated either by carriers or by conduction through bands in-\nduced by the rare earth ions. In addition, since the rare earth\ndopants may be optically active in these materials, magnetic\nand optical functionalities on a single chip may be possible.\nAlready cathodoluminescence \u0001CL\u0002 measurements of Gd-\nimplanted AlN thin films have yielded intense UV emission\nat 318 nm as well as weaker emissions at other\nwavelengths.20\u201322 Consequently, a greater understanding of\nthe behavior of Gd-doped wide band gap nitride semicon-\nductors is of high interest.\nIn this work, we have used ion implantation to incorpo-\nrate Gd ions into AlN films grown by molecular beam epi-\ntaxy \u0001MBE\u0002. The undoped AlN epilayers were grown by rf-\nplasma-assisted MBE at 900 \u00b0C on c-plane sapphire\nsubstrates and were insulating \u0001\u0002106 \u0003 cm\u0002 as determined\nby Hall measurements. The samples were implanted with Gd\nions at two energies \u0001160 and 320 keV\u0002 with doses of either\n1014 \u0001160 keV\u0002 plus 2\u00011014 \u0001320 keV\u0002 cm\u22122 or 2\u00011014\n\u0001160 keV\u0002 plus 4\u22121014 \u0001320 keV\u0002 cm\u00012. The samples were\nheld near room temperature during the implantation, and\nfrom visual inspection, the implanted regions were not amor-\nphous. Annealing was performed for 5 min under a flowing\nN2 gas at a temperature of 1178 K. No indication of the\nformation of second phases was found based on powder\nx-ray diffraction \u0001XRD\u0002 measurements. Portions of the\nsamples were examined using a superconducting quantum\ninterference device magnetometer \u0001Quantum Design mag-\nnetic properties measurement system\u0002 and clear hysteretic\nbehavior at 300 K was observed.23 After annealing the Gd-\nimplanted AlN epilayers were characterized by photolumi-\nnescence \u0001PL\u0002 and time resolved photoluminescence \u0001TRPL\u0002\nultraviolet \u0001UV\u0002 spectroscopy.

The peak intensity of the Gd-\nrelated emission has a high thermal stability from\n10 to 300 K and the transient behavior is on the order of\nnanoseconds.\nThe trivalent Gd ion \u0001Gd3+\u0002 has seven unpaired electrons\nin the unfilled 4f shell, which is shielded by the completely\nfilled 5s and 5p shells. The first excited manifold 6Pj of the\nGd3+ lies \u00034.5 eV \u0001318 nm\u0002 above the ground state 8S7\/2.\n24\nSince wurtzite AlN semiconductor material has a very large\nband gap, \u00036.1 eV \u0001203 nm\u0002, PL spectroscopy of this sys-\ntem requires deep UV sources. In the present experiments the\nquadrupled output from a Ti:sapphire laser led to above-\nband-gap excitation of the AlN host. The PL excitation con-\nsisted of a series of 197 nm laser pulses having 100 fs width\nand 76 MHz repetition rate. Below-band-gap excitation at\n263 nm was done by tripling the laser source to yield a simi-\nlar series of pulses. The PL emission was collected and ana-\nlyzed with a 1.3 m grating monochromator equipped with a\nmicrochannel plate photomultiplier tube used in a single\nphoton counting mode. TRPL spectroscopy was done using\nthe 197 nm excitation pulses.\nFigure 1 shows room temperature PL spectra over the\nrange of 250\u2013500 nm for a Gd-implanted AlN sample after\nannealing. The main emission line at 318 nm, which arises\nfrom the 6Pj-\n8S7\/2 transitions of the Gd3+ ion, was observed\nwith both above-band-gap \u0001197 nm\u0002 and below-band-gap\n\u0001266 nm\u0002 excitations. With above-band-gap excitation \u0004see\nFig. 1\u0001b\u0002\u0005 the emission line at 318 nm is very narrow with a\nfull width at half maximum \u0001FWHM\u0002 of \u00030.6 nm. The\n197 nm laser pulses are of sufficient energy to create\nelectron-hole pairs in the AlN host and to subsequently trans-\nfer energy to the Gd3+ ion. Since the emission at 318 nm\noccurs from the first excited manifold of the rare earth ion,\nthe precise relaxation process cannot be determined at this\ntime. With below-band-gap excitation \u0004see Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0005 the\nemission at 318 nm is quite broad with a FWHM of\n\u000322 nm. Higher emission intensity under below-band-gap\nexcitation is due to much higher excitation power. In this\ncase it appears that the Gd3+ ions are excited either reso-\nnantly through the 6Ij multiplet of levels or through material\ndefects in the AlN host. The XRD rocking curve measure-\nment of the Gd-implanted AlN layer yielded a value of\n2196 arc sec, which is more than four times the value of a\nhigh quality undoped AlN grown layer. Therefore, a combi-\nnation of excitation paths via defects in the host and direct\nintra-4f transitions seems very likely for the below-band-gap\nPL data. The difference in linewidth suggests that different\nsubsets of Gd3+ ions are excited using above- and below-\nband-gap pumping.4 In Fig. 2, a schematic diagram illus-\ntrates the two methods used for excitation of the Gd3+ ions\nand the resulting emission. Also shown in the diagram are\nthe band gap energies of AlN and GaN host materials. Since\nthe initial ferromagnetic measurements were done on GaN\nsamples, no UV emission would have been observable. Only\nwith wider band gap AlGaN alloys can some of the transi-\ntions of the Gd3+ ions be observed.\nThe dependence of the intensity of the Gd3+ PL emission\non the sample temperature is shown in Fig. 3. Spectral mea-\nsurements that were done over a range from 10 to 600 K, see\nFig. 3 \u0001top\u0002, indicate a seven fold reduction in peak intensity\nIemi with increasing temperature T. The data are plotted in\nFig. 3 \u0001bottom\u0002 and fitted with an inverse exponential,\nIemi\u0001T\u0002 = I0\/\u00061 + c exp\u0001\u2212 EA\/kT\u0002\u0007 , \u00011\u0002\nyielding a value of 82 meV for the activation energy EA of\nthis thermal quenching. This value compares favorably with\nthat found in other rare-earth-semiconductor material sys-\ntems such as GaN:Eu.25 Although the PL intensity is\nquenched at higher temperatures, the transition linewidth\ndoes not change with increasing temperature from\n10 to 600 K, as seen in Fig. 3 \u0001top\u0002. It should be noted that\nthere is some contribution to the observed linewidth from the\nmonochromator slit width. During PL measurements, the slit\nwidth was 250 \u0004m, which corresponds to a spectral disper-\nsion of 0.25 at 318 nm.\nTime resolved photoluminescence measurements of the\nemission at 318 nm were performed at 10 K using 197 nm\nexcitation. The data are plotted in Fig. 4 and show two dis-\ntinct decay transients of the UV emission. A good fit to the\nFIG. 2. Two excitation paths for Gd in AlN and the resulting emission.\nFIG. 3.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/apl.aip.org\/apl\/copyright.jsp\nexperimental data was obtained using a double-exponential\ntime dependence,\nIemi\u0001t\u0002 = I1 exp\u0001\u2212 \u00051\/t\u0002 + I2 exp\u0001\u2212 \u00052\/t\u0002 . \u00012\u0002\nThe fast component had a lifetime of \u00051=0.5 ns and the slow\ncomponent a lifetime of \u00052=2.0 ns. The double-exponential\nnature of the decay transient is similar to reports by Vetter et\nal.20 The observed decay times in this study, however, are\nseveral orders of magnitude smaller. A possible explanation\nfor the nanosecond lifetimes could be efficient cross-\nrelaxation processes due to a high peak Gd concentration\n\u0001\u00021019 cm\u22123\u0002. The ion implantation dose in these experi-\nments was nearly an order of magnitude higher than that\nused in the CL study. It also seems possible that the excita-\ntion of Gd3+ ions may be occurring indirectly from the e-h\nrecombination through induced defect levels. These defect\nlevels may at the same time provide efficient relaxation\nchannels for energy back transfer to the AlN host.26\nThe PL data presented here are quite different than re-\nsults of CL measurements done on similar Gd-implanted AlN\nthin films.20\u201322 While both PL and CL measurements yield an\nintense UV emission at 318 nm, only the CL measurements\nhave shown evidence of Gd3+ transitions at other wave-\nlengths, near 259 and 285 nm, arising from higher energy\nmanifolds. In CL measurements the intensity of emission at\nthese wavelengths is about 50 times weaker than the main\ntransition. With the present PL excitation, transitions at these\nwavelengths would need to occur indirectly through internal\nrelaxation of the higher energy 4f states of the excited Gd3+\nion and may be even weaker in intensity.\nResults of the dependence of the UV emission on sample\ntemperature are in greater disagreement. In CL measure-\nments reported previously20\u201322 the integrated emission inten-\nsity actually decreases at lower temperatures. The behavior\nfound here, where the PL intensity increases by more than a\nfactor of 3 from 300 to 10 K, is consistent with predominant\ndata taken over a range of different rare-earth-semiconductor\nhost systems.27,28 In addition, decay transients of the UV\nemission are much faster in the PL measurements \u0001on the\norder of nanoseconds\u0002 than in the CL measurements \u0001on the\norder of milliseconds\u0002. Further experiments are needed to\nclarify these differences but they may simply be due to dif-\nferences in the defects present in the starting materials.\nIn summary, Gd ions have been incorporated into AlN\nepilayers by ion implantation and 4f-related UV emission\nwas observed with optical excitation. An emission line at\n318 nm, associated with the 6Pj-\n8S7\/2 transitions of the Gd3+\nion, was observed with both above-band-gap and below-\nband-gap excitations. The 318 nm emission was studied as a\nfunction of sample temperature and the peak PL intensity\nwas found to be very stable with temperature from\n10 to 300 K. This work demonstrates that spectrally narrow,\ndeep UV emission lines can be obtained from Gd-implanted\nAlN under optical excitation. Furthermore, with proper in\nsitu doping during epitaxial growth and device design, it may\nbe possible to form electroluminescence III-V emitters for\nspecific UV optoelectronic applications such as white\nlighting.29 In addition, these experiments provide evidence\nthat integration of ferromagnetic behavior and UV emission\ncan achieved in the same Gd-doped AlN thin film.\nResearch at Kansas State University and at University of\nFlorida was partially supported by ARO.\n1H.
