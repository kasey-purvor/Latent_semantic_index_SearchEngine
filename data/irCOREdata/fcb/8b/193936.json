All rights reserved.\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 2\nspecific research on high speed turbulent jets is likely to have a main impact on the\nnext generation supersonic civil aircraft. Seiner et al.[2] reported that enhanced jet\nmixing is obtained when jet plume perturbations occur close to the nozzle lip, such\nas when the nozzle is operated off its design pressure ratio. The radiated noise is\nalso significantly increased at this flow regime and further efforts in noise source\nprediction and control are required to reduce the noise footprint from aircraft using\nhigh speed jet engines.\nIn this study the flow unsteadiness and noise production of an over-expanded\nmodel jet are investigated by a numerical approach. The approach aims to repro-\nduce the essential flow dynamics in the early stages of the jet plume development,\nwhere large-scale motion in the shear layer interacts with shock cells and produces\nscreech noise. At certain flow regimes screech dominates the acoustic radiation in\nthe upstream direction[3]. This study aims to reproduce the important physics of\nsuch noise production. Convectively amplifying velocity waves are captured in time\nadvancing numerical predictions, showing the existence of a dominant or funda-\nmental instability mode. The velocity and vorticity unsteadiness combine to give\nan unsteady \u2018hydrodynamic\u2019 pressure field that is further detailed. The levels of\npressure amplitude predicted are well above what would be obtained from a fully\nexpanded jet of equivalent thrust.\n1.2. BACKGROUND\nAn over-expanded jet is obtained from a supersonic nozzle operated below its\ndesign pressure ratio. A schematic of the jet flow is presented in Figure 1. An un-\nsteady shear layer is shed from the nozzle lip in which large scale vortical structures\nare embedded. These flow instabilities originate from the nozzle lip and develop as\nconvectively amplifying velocity and vorticity waves. The shear layer inflected ve-\nlocity profile supports this Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that is the driving physics\nof the aerodynamic unsteadiness. The shear flow bounds a high speed flow core\nwhere a quasi spatially periodic sequence of compressions and expansions form a\nshock cell structure. Aerodynamic pressure fluctuations and noise radiation are also\ncharacteristic features of the unsteady flow.\nPhase coherence in the flow instability produces dominant modes, known as\nscreech modes after Powell[4], and the flow instability interaction with the shock\ncell system generates resonance. Measurements[5, 2, 3] for a Mach 2 supersonic\nnozzle jet are reviewed in Seiner[6]. A review by Raman[7, 8] covers sonic nozzle\nscreech and more complex nozzle geometries. The details of the instability mode\ninteraction at a shock are reported by Westley & Woolley[9] and by Panda[10, 11].\nThese time dependent jet screech schlieren flow visualisations show large-scale vor-\ntical structures interacting with the shock cells and generating screech. These large\nscale vortical structures are distinct from the random fine scale turbulence in the\nmixing region. There is thus scope in attempting a time dependent numerical model\nof the flow in which the large-scale flow structure is resolved in time while the ef-\nfects of turbulence are accounted for by a turbulence closure model. This is the\napproach followed in this study to further a better understanding of the physics\nand prediction of screech.\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 3\n30.25De\nScreech noise\nShock cone\nUnsteady shocks\nLarge-scale instabilities\nr\nMixing\nDe\nu e\nregion\nx\nShear layer\nb1\nFigure 1. Schematic of an over-expanded jet.\nImportant aspects of the time mean flow, such as shear layer growth, flow en-\ntrainment, shock cell geometry, are affected by the jet unsteadiness. Panda[11]\nprovided time accurate measurements of an induced shock cell motion in the under-\nexpanded jet regime. The present numerical study relates to over-expanded jet\nshock cell fluctuations. The numerical method attempts to resolve the combined\neffects of the orderly large-scale instabilities and shock oscillation on the mean jet\ngeometry. The time dependent approach better describes the flow physics than the\nsteady flow analytical method of Pack[12]. It offers also a better stand point to\ndevelop screech noise prediction methods.\nPhase averaged measurements by Panda[10] confirm that the shock fluctuation\nmainly occurs in the vicinity of the convecting vortical waves in the shear layer. The\nshock tip position in the vicinity of the shear layer displaces mainly in the streamwise\ndirection and tends to follow the convection of the vortex cores. The magnitude\nof the aerodynamic pressure fluctuation is of concern, since it can dominate over\nthe acoustic one in the neighbourhood of the jet plume. This aerodynamic or\n\u2018hydrodynamic\u2019 pressure fluctuation is localised in the jet plume and would not be\ndetected in far-field acoustic measurements where screech noise is dominant. The\nintense tonal pressure can affect the aircraft structure integrity, as documented by\nHay & Rose[13].\nThe characteristics of jet noise when screech is present is well documented in the\nliterature(e.g. Raman[7, 8]). The source of jet screech noise is described by Powell[4]\nas the interaction of the convected shear layer instabilities with the shock cells in jet\nplume. The details of such interaction and of its self-sustained feedback have been\nthe subject of investigation over the past 40 years, yet the reliable prediction of\nscreech amplitude remains an open challenge[7, 8]. Further advances are sought in\nthe modelling of the driving flow instability, the jet screech noise sources and shear\nlayer receptivity. The present work focuses on predicting the flow unsteadiness.\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 4\n2. FLOW CONDITIONS\nA fully expanded Mach 2 air jet issues from a 49.89mm exit diameter (De) su-\npersonic round nozzle when operated at the design pressure ratio ps\/p\u221e = 7.824.\nThe computational model nozzle lip is 0.18De thick. The flow at exit is axial\nand cold, the stagnation temperature is 293.06K. The selected exit and ambient\nflow conditions closely match the measured settings by Seiner et al[2]. The exit\nstatic temperature, pressure, density and axial velocity are, respectively, 162.81K,\n101.32kN\/m2, 2.168kg\/m3 and 511.5m\/s.

GOVERNING EQUATIONS\nThe mass, momentum and energy conservation in the axisymmetric flow is gov-\nerned by the Navier Stokes equations. A suitable averaging for these equations is\nconsidered that is tailored to the unsteady jet flow.\nTime dependent jet screech measurements by Westley & Woolley[9] and Panda[10]\nshow large scale instabilities developing over a background of random fluctuations,\nthe small scale turbulence. The instabilities originate from the nozzle lip and are\nthe growing eigenmodes of the shear layer. Indeed, Tam and Hu[14] showed that\nan appropriate modelling of the instability initial growth is by considering small\nshear layer perturbations, based on hydrodynamic instability theory. Tam and Hu\u2019s\nresult indicates that the excitation of these Kelvin-Helmholtz type instabilities is\nessentially an inviscid process that can equally be modelled by a time-dependent\nnumerical solution of the flow governing equations. In mode growth modelling, the\nconvective fluxes in the scheme play a dominant role and the instabilities take the\nform of convecting velocity and vorticity waves.\nAs the instabilities propagate downstream, momentum diffusion reduces the asymp-\ntotic growth of these finite-amplitude waves and the modes saturate. This phase of\nshear layer development occurs above the shock cell pattern, where instability-shock\ninteraction generates screech. Further downstream, away from the main screech\nnoise sources[7, 8], the instability modes decay and generate a turbulent kinetic\nenergy cascade to higher frequencies and wavenumbers, where kinetic energy is dis-\nsipated at the Kolmogorov length scale. A fully developed turbulent flow sets up\ndownstream of the shock-shear layer interaction region, the latter being the estab-\nlished screech noise source mechanism.\nA model is sought for the time dependent evolution of the large scale shear layer\ninstability and surrounding compressible flow, with emphasis on capturing the fluid\nmotion from the nozzle lip up to the dominant instability modes saturation zone,\nextending to the upstream threshold of the fully mixed flow region. As time accuracy\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 5\nis of concern, a time averaging approach was followed to discretize the governing\nequations. The method consists to time average by an interval that is long compared\nwith the unresolved motion and sufficiently short to capture the time history of the\nlarge scale motion. Upon short time averaging, a scalar f is split between a short\ntime averaged f\u02dc and a fluctuation component f \u2032\u2032, so that f = f\u02dc + f \u2032\u2032.\nThe fluctuation products obtained are formally identical to the Reynolds averaged\nequations. For simplicity, terms like \u03c1\u02dc\u2032\u2032T \u2032\u2032 are not modelled since, for instance, heat\ntransfer effects are dependent on the time-mean temperature gradient. As in Lilley\net al.[15] it is further assumed that product terms involving the small scale density\nfluctuation make little added contribution when the added variables involve u\u2032\u2032 or\nu\u2032\u2032u\u2032\u2032.\nThe k \u2212 \u03c9 two equation model of Wilcox[16] is adopted to provide a first ap-\nproximation to the short time averaged fluctuation products. For a steady flow\nnumerical model, like the fully expanded jet test presented later on, the method is\nidentical to an explicit Reynolds averaged approach and converges to a steady solu-\ntion. In the case of jet screech, the k \u2212 \u03c9 model covers a different role. Specifically\nit provides localised dissipation by eddy viscosity in the shear layer, damping the\nfinite amplitude wave growth within. Short time averaged velocity gradients are\nused in the model rather than time mean gradients. This provides a mechanism\nfor the large scale structures to drive the eddy viscosity field, yielding maximum\ndamping as the shear layer modes reach maximum amplification. The convective\nterms in the k\u2212\u03c9 model give an eddy viscosity maximum downstream of the mode\nsaturation point which occurs between 6 and 10 jet diameters downstream of the\nnozzle exit. This provides a model for instability mode damping in the mixed flow\nregion, qualitatively reproducing the round shear layer mode physics obtained by\nLilley [17]: After saturation, the shear layer modes are convectively suppressed.\nThe short time averaged Navier Stokes equations for an axisymmetric flow in\ncylindrical coordinates (x, r) are\n\u2202rW\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202rF\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202rG\n\u2202r\n+ S =\n\u2202rF t\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202rGt\n\u2202r\n+ rSt, (1)\nwhere the conservative variable vector W , inviscid (F ,G) and turbulent (F t,Gt)\nflux vectors, and axisymmetric source terms (S,St) are\nW = (\u03c1\u02dc, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcx, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcr, \u03c1\u02dce\u02dcs)\nT ,\nF =\n(\n\u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcx, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dc\n2\nx + p\u02dc, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcxu\u02dcr, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcxh\u02dcs\n)T\n,\nG=\n(\n\u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcr, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcru\u02dcx, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dc\n2\nr + p\u02dc, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcrh\u02dcs\n)T\n,\nS = (0, 0,\u2212p\u02dc, 0)T ,\nF t =\n(\n0, \u03c4\u02dcxx, \u03c4\u02dcxr, u\u02dcx\u03c4\u02dcxx + u\u02dcr \u03c4\u02dcxr + q\u02dcx + (\u00b5\u02dcl + \u03c3\u2217\u00b5\u02dct) \u2202k\u02dc\/ (Re\u2202x)\n)T\n,\nGt =\n(\n0, \u03c4\u02dcrx, \u03c4\u02dcrr, u\u02dcx\u03c4\u02dcrx + u\u02dcr \u03c4\u02dcrr + q\u02dcr + (\u00b5\u02dcl + \u03c3\u2217\u00b5\u02dct) \u2202k\u02dc\/ (Re\u2202r)\n)T\n,\nSt =\n(\n0, 0,\n2\n3\n\u00b5\u02dcl + \u00b5\u02dct\nrRe\n(\n\u2202u\u02dcx\n\u2202x\n+\n\u2202u\u02dcr\n\u2202r\n\u2212 2 u\u02dcr\nr\n)\n+\n2\n3\n\u03c1\u02dc\nk\u02dc\nr\n, 0\n)T\n.

A more systematic\nconstants calibration is required by comparison with Large Eddy Simulation results\nthat resolve the jet kinetic energy inertial sub-range. This may improve the mixing\nflow prediction and eventually enable to address jet mixing noise. Performing such\nspace resolved simulation is currently beyond the computational resources available\nto the authors.\n3.3.

A finer\n625 \u00d7 280 mesh (Figure 3(b)) was also used to study the cell size effects on the\nnumerical prediction.\nThe over-expanded jet features a shock expansion pattern that characterises\nthe high speed flow, close to the nozzle outlet. To resolve these flow discontinu-\nities an approximate Riemann solver is introduced as in Zhang & Edwards[19].\nThe Roe[20, 21] flux difference split approximate Riemann solver implemented by\nQuirk[22] evaluates the inviscid fluxes at the unit cell interfaces. The mid-mod flux\nlimiter introduces an upwind bias close to the shocks to preserve monotonicity. The\nmethod reduces to a second order centred Lax-Wendroff equivalent in regions of\nsmooth flow. Second order central differences are used to evaluate the turbulent\nfluxes at the cell boundaries.\nBy applying the Gauss divergence theorem to the discrete governing equations for\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 9\nmass, momentum and energy, the fluxes are related to the change of flow state with\ntime. Integration in time is then performed by a compact four step Runge Kutta\nscheme as in Manna[23]. Non-standard Runge Kutta coefficients (1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.12)\nmaximise the scheme stability and give a theoretical 2\n\u221a\n2 Courant number limit for\ninviscid flows(Manna[23]).\nThe boundary conditions are as shown in Figure 2. Along the jet axis b1 the\naxisymmetric boundary condition W j = W \u2217j\u22121, W j+1 = W\n\u2217\nj\u22122 is imposed, where\nW \u2217k = (\u03c1\u02dc, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcx \u2212 2\u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcx\u03b4ik, \u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcr \u2212 2\u03c1\u02dcu\u02dcr\u03b4jk, \u03c1\u02dce\u02dcs)T .

At the supersonic jet\ninlet the flow is fixed.\nThe time dependent numerical simulation was started from zero flow ambient\nconditions. The computation was then advanced by a fixed time step \u2206t\u02dc = 5\u00d710\u22125\nto t\u02dc = 0.25 to obtain a stationary flow, as indicated by the static axial pressure\nmonitored at x = 5De, 15De, 25De. The turbulent kinetic energy remains at its ini-\ntial zero value, as detailed in Rona[24], since this is a trivial solution in equation (7).\nDuring this initial phase of the computation, screech develops without forcing the\ninviscid model flow. At this stage, the screech frequency is not pre-determined. The\npredicted pressure history from the inviscid model jet was then analysed to quan-\ntify the dominant screech frequency f and Strouhal number Str = fDe\/ue. This\ngave Str = 0.36. The time dependent turbulent jet model then used this screech\nfrequency to sustain the flow instability.\nThe dominant screech Strouhal number predicted by the inviscid jet model was\nvalidated against the reference literature[25]. Specifically, the unified description of\nshock associated noise and screech tones in Tam[25] leads to the predictive relation-\nship for the screech frequency\nf =\nuc\nL (1 +Mc)\n(11)\nwhere uc is the convection speed of shear layer instabilities in the jet, Mc = uc\/a\u221e\nis the convection Mach number, referenced to the ambient speed of sound a\u221e, and L\nis the fundamental shock cell wavelength. In Tam[25], L is derived from a multiple\nscales shock cell structure model evaluated where the shear layer instabilities attain\ntheir maximum amplitude. Equation 3.3 was shown to be identical to the result of\nPowell[4] and that of Harper-Bourne and Fisher[26] for shock associated propagation\nin the upstream direction when L is taken to be the shock cell spacing[25]. In the\npresent study, L is taken as the average shock spacing of shock cells 2, 3 and 4,\nwhich are the most active flow areas of the supersonic jet plume. To evaluate uc,\nthe approximation uc = 0.7uj from Tam[25] is used, where uj is the fully expanded\njet velocity. L is evaluated from the time averaged axial pressure measurements of\nNorum and Seiner[3] as L = 0.87De. Given that uc = 0.7uj = 0.58ue, equation 3.3\ngives Str = 0.356 \u2248 0.36, which agrees with the inviscid jet model prediction.\nTo obtain a turbulent jet prediction, the k\u02dc and \u03c9\u02dc fields were primed to non-zero\nvalues and the computation was further advanced to t\u02dc = 1.4. Upon priming k\u02dc\nand \u03c9\u02dc, the transient values of eddy viscosity tended to suppress screech, therefore,\nto sustain screech, the flow was forced at a single point in the separating shear\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 10\nlayer, along the nozzle lip line. This forcing pre-determines the fundamental screech\nfrequency in the turbulent jet simulation. Still, the chosen forcing frequency was\nnot arbitrary but was derived from the inviscid prediction of the flow field, which is\nsimilar in geometry to the turbulent jet flow field close to the nozzle lip, where the\nscreech instability develops. This motivated the selection of the forcing frequency\nf . Forcing was obtained by the introduction of single point momentum disturbance\nof amplitude 0.071\u03c1UeDe\/\u03b4 at (x = 0.5De, r = 0.5De), \u03b4 being the shear layer local\nvorticity thickness[27].\nThe aerodynamic pressure prediction at x = 5De was essentially insensitive upon\nchanging the disturbance spectrum from f to a linear combination of f\/2, f, 2f\n(equal amplitude in-phase components). Increasing by 3 fold the perturbed area\ncaused a variation of pressure amplitude prediction at x = 5De below 10%.\nStationary flow statistics were collected between t\u02dc = 1.4 and t\u02dc = 2.15. The\ntime step \u2206t\u02dc = 5\u00d710\u22125 satisfies the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy(CFL) condition and\ncorresponds to 0.28CFL and 0.56CFL on the 625 \u00d7 140 and 625 \u00d7 280 meshes\nrespectively. The computation was performed on the Rutherford Appleton Labora-\ntory DEC8400, UK. The computational effort on the 0.2GFlop\/s sequential peak\nperformance machine is 15 CPU hours per job. A disk space of 18.5 megabytes was\nused for each supersonic jet test case. Specifically, the program and executables\noccupy 5 megabytes of file space and the data file size is 12.5 megabytes.\n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n4.1. FULLY EXPANDED JET\nWhen a Mach 2 nozzle is operated at its design pressure ratio, a shock free plume\nis obtained. In practice, such condition is rarely achieved due to slight imperfections\nin the nozzle geometry or boundary layer growth that prevent parallel exit flow. A\nweak shock cell pattern downstream of the nozzle was obtained in the experiment of\nSeiner et al.[2]. This can be detected from small oscillations in the measured time\naveraged axial velocity[2], close to the nozzle exit plane, shown in Figure 4. The\ncomputed flow field also shows a weak over-expansion and weak shock cells can be\nnoticed in the time mean density field predictions of Figure 5(a). These predictions\nwere found to be very sensitive to the nozzle pressure ratio and weak shock cells\nwere produced when a four digits pressure ratio ps\/p\u221e = 7.824 was used.\nThe time mean results are non-dimensional in the same way of Section 3.1. A\nturbulent shear layer develops downstream from the nozzle lip (Figure 5(b)), grow-\ning linearly with the downstream direction while the jet entrains fluid from the\nsurrounding medium. The shear layer reaches the jet axis between 12De and 13De\ndownstream of the exit plane, enclosing a region of Mach 2 flow, the high speed core.\nFurther downstream the jet spreading reduces the axial Mach number below 2 and\nby x = 25De the flow is fully subsonic. The axial extension of the high speed core\nand the streamwise velocity along the jet axis are compared with measurements in\nFigure 4. The small amplitude fluctuations close to the nozzle exit are due to the\nweak shock cell pattern in the jet plume. In experiment, this is likely to depend\non slight imperfections in the nozzle geometry or boundary layer growth that pre-\nvent parallel exit flow. Therefore only an approximate match is achieved with the\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 11\nu\nx\nx\/D e 30\n1.2\n0.2\n0\nFigure 4.

A fair agreement is found for\nthe length of the high speed core, suggesting that jet flow entrainment leading to\nshear layer growth is predicted. The shear layer growth rate in the fully mixed flow\nregion is somewhat higher than in measurements.\nThe constant jet spreading rate is unaffected by the plume approaching the com-\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 12\nputational domain radial boundary b3, indicating that the implemented boundary\nconditions are adequate. A localised reduced jet spreading is noticeable close to the\nexit flow boundary. This effect is confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the\nexit boundary.\nThe shear layer growth and radial spread are further quantified by the half velocity\npoint r0.5 (x) and shear layer thickness parameter b (x). As in Seiner & Ponton[28],\nb (x) = r0.5 (x) \u2212 r0.1 (x), where r0.5 (x) is the radial distance at which u\u00afx is 0.5\nof the speed on the jet axis, and similarly for r0.1 (x). The shear layer thickness is\nmonotonically growing in the streamwise direction, both around the high speed core\nand in the mixing region which develops downstream of it(Figure 6(a)). A reduced\nrate of growth was measured at the end of the high speed core, where the flow\nadapts to the geometrically self similar regime of mixing region, detailed further\non. This is captured in the predictions. The looser agreement in this region can\nbe attributed to the transitional character of the flow which could also have been\naffected by the intrusive measurement technique used in Seiner & Ponton[28]. The\nmaximum discrepancy is approximately 10%. The half velocity point distribution\nin Figure 6(b) clearly displays the regions where the shear layer encloses a high\nspeed core (x < 12De) and the mixing region downstream of it. The first three\nmeasurement points close to the nozzle lip exit show some variation in the half\nvelocity point slope with respect to the flow further downstream. The trend is also\nnoticeable in the predictions, in spite of some spatial discretisation effects. The jet\nflow within 1De from the nozzle exit is not fully developed but tonal shear layer\ninstabilities characterise the local kinetic energy spectrum, as discussed in Lilley[17].\nIn the mixing region (x > 12De) the mean velocity profile is characterised by a ge-\nometrical self-similarity, shown in Figure 7. Normalised velocity profiles at different\nstreamwise locations are presented, where the streamwise velocity is normalised by\nits axial value and the radial coordinate by a shifted streamwise distance (x\u2212 x0).\nA reasonable collapse is obtained, in agreement measurements. The agreement im-\nproves at (x > 15De) away from the reduced shear layer growth region identified in\nFigures 6(a-b) at the end of the high speed core. Away from the high speed core,\nthe velocity profile can be taken as proportional to (x\u2212 x0), displaying an almost\nlinear jet spreading, also shown in Figure 5(b).\nThese predictions of a fully expanded Mach 2 jet provide a first validation for the\nturbulence model implementation in the time dependent numerical method, applied\nto axisymmetric flows. In the numerical model jet the eddy viscosity determines\nthe jet entrainment and the transfer of momentum from the high speed flow to the\nsurrounding medium. In the over-expanded jet study that follows, the resolved mo-\ntion of screech instability mainly depends on the inviscid pressure-velocity balance\nin the flow and the Wilcox k \u2212 \u03c9 model is used to approximate the flow geometry.\nAs such, the turbulence model provides a first working attempt towards accounting\nfor the shear layer growth in modelling screech.\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 13\n0\n2\n0\n2\n(a)\n(b)\n0\ne\n30\ner\/D\nb(x\n)\/D\n0.\n5\nr \n  \n(x)\n\/D\ne\nFigure 6.

OVER-EXPANDED JET: MEAN FLOW\nA 7.824 stagnation to ambient pressure ratio is imposed at the Mach 2 nozzle\nexit to obtain an over-expanded jet. The pressure difference between the nozzle\nexit plane and the ambient conditions initiates a shock-expansion sequence at the\nnozzle lip, displayed by the time mean density contours in Figure 8(a). The growing\nshear layer shed from the nozzle lip bounds the shock containing high speed flow,\nproviding a boundary for multiple shock reflections. The intercepting shocks form\nfour conical shock cells of streamwise decaying intensity. Downstream of x \u223c 6De\nthe shocks and expansion waves in high speed flow are of a reduced intensity and\nassume a minor role in the mean flow development. Further downstream the flow is\nfully subsonic and shock free. The streamwise extension of the high speed flow is x \u223c\n10De, where the shear layer reaches the jet axis. Further downstream a fully mixed\nflow region is formed as for the fully expanded jet. Comparison between the mean\nvelocity predictions in Figure 8(b) and the previous result for the fully expanded jet\nin Figure 5(b) highlights different shear layer growth rates at x \u2264 6De and the over-\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 14\nx\nx\nu\n  \n\/u\n (x\n,0)\n0r\/(x-x ) 0.0250\n0.0\n1.0\nFigure 7.

(\u2212) extrapolation from\nexperimental data collapse in Seiner & Ponton[28].\nexpanded jet shear layer is thinner in the early stages of jet development. In the\ncurrent study an axisymmetric screech mode is modelled. At this flow regime, the\npresence of pressure and density gradients in the shear flow may have locally affected\nthe vorticity growth. Panda[10] highlighted that, when shock cells are present in an\nunder-expanded jet, the convection speed of instability waves in the shear layer is\nmodulated by the streamwise pressure gradient. A similar compressible effect in the\npredicted flow of the over-expanded jet may likewise influence the growth rate of the\ninstabilities and the shear flow mean spread. In an asymmetric B screech mode[7, 8]\nthe presence of the flapping plane is a more dominant effect in determining the\nshear layer mean growth and the jet features a faster spreading rate when screech\nis enhanced.\nThe downstream mixing regions of fully and over-expanded jets show geometric\nself-similar flows with the same defining characteristics. The regular contour spacing\nindicates a linear shear layer growth rate. Due to the mixing region similarity\nbetween the test cases, the analysis in the followings is focused on the high speed\nflow upstream of it.\nThe mean pressure distribution close to the nozzle outlet discloses further details\nof the shock containing flow(Figure 9). Along the r = 0.25De line (Figure 9(b))\nsharp pressure peaks and rounded pressure minima alternate, corresponding conical\nshocks and expansion regions also recorded in measurement[3]. As the jet is over-\nexpanded, the jet exit pressure pe is lower than the ambient pressure p\u221e and the\nshock cell sequence starts with a shock at the nozzle lip. Figure 9(b) indicates that\nthe magnitude of the pressure gradient is larger at shocks than in the expansion\nregions, in accordance to the the shock physics of being a more localised pressure\nfluctuation. This is correctly captured by the numerical method. On the jet axis\nthe shock reflection increases the thickness of the compression region(Figure 9(a)),\nleading to a more sinusoidal pressure trace. Figure 9 also gives a quantitative\ndescription of the streamwise decaying shock strength observed in Figure 8(a).

The main flow features determining shock\nmovement are (i) the periodic pressure perturbation due to upstream propagating\nsound waves, (ii) the coupling motion of each shock, (iii) the aerodynamic pressure\nfluctuation due to the passage of organised structures, and (iv) the distortion of\nthe subsonic-supersonic interface during shear layer oscillations. The shock move-\nment causes shock smearing in the time averaged prediction. Sharper shocks are\nshown downstream of the second shock cell in the short time averaged results of\nFigure 10, compared to Figure 8(a). Shock smearing in the time averaged results is\nthus proportional to shock movement.\nThe time averaged pressure modulation under-prediction in Figure 9 could be\ndue to a shock oscillation of larger amplitude in the computed flow field. In fact\nthe measured shock amplitude is best matched in the neighbourhood of the nozzle\nlip, where shear layer instability modes are not fully developed. The onset of non-\naxisymmetric modes in the measured flow could have also contributed. As the time\ndependent shock fluctuation is not documented in the measurements, the matter\nawaits a further investigation.\n4.3. OVER-EXPANDED JET: UNSTEADY AERODYNAMICS\nIn over-expanded jets, large scale shear layer oscillations are a dominant feature\nof the time dependent flow. These develop around the high speed shock containing\nflow and are shown by arrows 1 in the short time averaged density prediction of\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 17\n1\n2\n3\n3\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(a) 10De5De\nr\nx\nx\nr\nx\nr\nr\nx\nFigure 10.

The instabilities start from the nozzle lip and grow in the streamwise\ndirection by convective amplification. The modes captured by the axisymmetric nu-\nmerical method are toroidal. Past measurements by Seiner et al.[29] indicated that\ntoroidal modes are significant contributions to the flow instability in over-expanded\njets. These modes increase in relative amplitude with the degree of over-expansion\nover azimuthal instabilities and are dominant in the fully expanded jet Mach num-\nber range Mj \u2264 1.2. At Mj = 1.49 the jet plume studied by Seiner et al.[29] could\nhave exhibited both toroidal and helical or flapping shear layer instabilities. These\nhelical or flapping instabilities are not captured by the axisymmetric numerical\nmethod available for this study. Consequently, the numerical method is unable to\naddress any mode staging between axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes in\nthe jet, leading to the probable absence of some higher order modes in the predicted\nnear-field pressure fluctuation spectra presented later on. Still, the time-dependent\nnumerical method provides a valuable insight into the convective amplification of\nflow instabilities in the jet shear layer and into their interaction with the shock\ncells, which is the established mechanism for screech generation. This underlying\nself-sustained instability mechanism, involving the selective amplification of shear\nlayer instability modes, the shear layer interaction with the shock cell pattern and\nthe upstream propagation of feed-back disturbances, is fundamentally similar be-\ntween axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric screech regimes. Therefore, the numer-\nical method enables to detail salient aspects of this time-dependent compressible\nflow instability, albeit the analysis is restricted to the axisymmetric modes of the\njet.\nThe streamwise growth of the simulated toroidal instability modes, close to the\nnozzle lip, has been determined by monitoring the time-dependent radial velocity\nat six streamwise locations, between 1De and 3.5De, along the nozzle lip line. To\nisolate the contributions from individual modes in the radial velocity fluctuation,\nnarrow band-pass filtering has been used. Specifically, the power spectral density\nof the radial velocity has been windowed around the fundamental instability mode\nStrouhal number Str = 0.36 and its harmonics with a square window of width\n\u2206Str = 0.022. Figure 11 shows the amplification of the dominant mode and of\nits second harmonic along the nozzle lip line. The predictions are normalised by\nthe respective mode amplitudes at x = 1De. Between x = 1.5De and x \u223c 3De\nthe dominant instability mode is, in essence, exponentially growing, with an expo-\nnential amplification factor of 1.5 per nozzle exit diameter De, as indicated by the\ncontinuous line. The second harmonic also grows exponentially between x = 1De\nand x \u223c 2.5De at a rate of 1.75 per De, as indicated by the dashed line.\nBetween x = 3De and x = 5De the finite amplitude oscillation causes the propa-\ngation of the mode non-linearities, the dominant instability mode saturates and the\nshear layer is rolled up. This flow evolution was also observed in the axisymmet-\nric shear layer experiments of Gharib & Roshko[30], indicating a Kelvin-Helmholtz\ntype instability.\nThe convected instabilities saturate to their maximum amplitude towards the end\nof the high speed core where they interact with the quasi-periodic shock pattern,\nproducing an unsteady pressure field. One of such interactions is marked by arrow\nnumber 2 in Figure 10(a). This interaction provides the feedback at the nozzle lip for\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 19\n1  2  3  4\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nx\/De\nln\n [A\n(x)\n\/A\n(1D\n )] e\nFigure 11.

This tonal characteristic\nof the instability is given by the match between a standing wave pressure pattern and\nthe shear layer instability wavelength(Panda[10]). Jet screech is thus established.\nFour phases of the predicted screech fundamental cycle are shown in the sequence\nof Figure 10(a-d).\nExamining the shock position in the sequence Figure 10(b-c) highlights shock\nmovement. This is most evident in the third cell, at x \u223c 2.5De, where the shock\nidentified by arrow number 3 bows upstream in Fig. 10(b) and downstream in\nFig. 10(c). The wave-like motion of velocity and vorticity waves along the shear\nlayer can be observed in the short time averaged velocity sequence in Figure 12.\nThe pairs of local streamwise velocity maxima and minima at either side of the\nshear layer indicate downstream propagating phase coherent points. The phase\ncoherent velocity minima at the top edge of the shear layer are marked by the\narrows number 1 in Figure 12(b). The time mean distance between two points is\nthe wavelength of the screech second harmonic \u03bb\/2. The mean convection speed\nis 0.67ue. Figure 12(d) shows a slightly non-uniform spacing between successive\nphase coherent points, indicated by the arrows number 2, suggesting a variation in\nconvection\/phase speed of the instability modes in the streamwise direction. The\nprincipal causes are (i) the pressure gradients associated with the unsteady pressure\nfield extending from the shear layer to the free stream and (ii) compressible effects\nfrom the high speed core edging the shear layer. Modulation in convective speed\nwas measured and reported by Panda[10] for a similar under-expanded round model\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 20\njet.\nAt x > 5De the shear layer develops into the fully mixed flow region. Close to the\ndownstream boundary, the time dependent results do not display any departure from\na uniform growth rate, indicating that the implemented computational boundary\nconditions are adequate.\nIn a high Reynolds number jet, the fully mixing region develops as a high Reynolds\nnumber wake. As the rolled up vortices break down, vorticity is transferred to\nhigher frequency and wavenumbers in the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. At\nRe = 2.3 \u00d7 106 there is no evidence of vortex pairing which is instead a feature of\nlower Reynolds number jets. In the numerical model, these higher frequency and\nwavenumber modes are modelled by the turbulent kinetic energy which features a\ntime averaged maximum at x \u223c 5De (Figure 13(a)). As the fully mixing region\nexpands further downstream from the nozzle exit all velocity fluctuations are mod-\nelled by the unresolved part of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. Their effect\non the conservative variables is estimated by the k \u2212 \u03c9 turbulence model and the\nshort time averaged flow in this region is steady.\nThe interaction of the downstream propagating velocity and vorticity waves drive\nthe unsteady aerodynamic pressure in the predicted shear flow of the over-expanded\njet, shown in Figure 13(b). Local maxima in unsteady pressure fluctuation p\u02dcrms oc-\ncur in the shear layer at 2De \u2264 x \u2264 5De where the shear layer rolls up. Longitudinal\nundulations in the predicted contours are noticeable outside the high speed core.\nThe oscillations have spacing similar to the shock cells inside the high speed core\nand are probably due to the super-imposition of a stronger downstream propagating\npressure wave associated to the instability wave convection and a weaker upstream\npropagating wave. The oscillations are more pronounced away from the jet axis,\nbeyond the nozzle lip line, suggesting a possible different nature between the two\nwave fronts. It is reasonable to assume that both pressure fluctuations are gener-\nated approximately along the nozzle lip line by the momentum unsteadiness in the\nshear layer. The downstream pressure fluctuation is likely to be an aerodynamic\nor \u2018hydrodynamic\u2019 Poisson pressure, decaying radially as 1\/r2. The upstream wave\nfront can be classified as an acoustic radiation, decaying as 1\/r. At a certain dis-\ntance from the shear layer the different rate of decay eventually leads to a standing\nwave pattern. Further away from the shear layer the acoustic waves are attenuated\nby the dissipative characteristics of the second order accurate numerical method.\nWork is on going on higher order dispersion relation preserving methods along the\nlines of Shen & Tam[31] and Manning & Lele[32] to better address the acoustic field\nwithin the computational domain.\nInside the high speed core the streamwise fluctuations of the conical shock fronts\nabout their mean position show as p\u02dcrms maxima in Figure 13(b). These maxima\nare distinct from the high p\u02dcrms region in the shear layer and more compact in the\nstreamwise direction, confirming that shock movement occurs within the bounds of\n0.5De or half a shock cell. Along the axis the predicted root mean square pressure\npeak agrees with the time mean shock location predicted in Figures 8(a) & 9(a). The\npressure maxima on the axis are of larger amplitude than in the shear layer. This\nresult is interesting, since the largest pressure fluctuations would be expected at the\nlocation of the largest shock movement that occur along the unsteady shear layer.\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 21\n(d)\n1 1\n2 22\n(c)\n(b)\nx\nr\n(a)\nx\nr\nx\n10Dee5D\nr\nr\nx\nFigure 12.

This feature was also measured by Panda[11] for a similar\nunder-expanded jet flow.\nThe short time averaged pressure fluctuation amplitude in the mixing region at\nx > 5De is reduced by eddy viscosity effects as momentum fluctuations are not\nresolved but modelled by the turbulent kinetic energy k\u02dc. No appreciable increase\nin p\u02dcrms is noticeable approaching the computational domain boundaries, indicating\nthat the implemented boundary conditions are adequate for this jet flow application.\n4.4. OVER-EXPANDED JET: PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS\nThe streamwise momentum fluctuation in the shear layer is accompanied by un-\nsteady pressure.

The predictions are approximately 6dB lower than in the\ninviscid jet model of Zhang & Edwards[19]. In the present simulation the eddy\nviscosity determines the maximum mode amplitude and ought to better model the\neffects of the less resolved inertial subrange influencing the mode saturation.\nThe selective amplification of shear layer instability modes produces an aerody-\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 23\n0.0 2.0\n 80\n180\n0.32\n0.36 0.46\nStr\nPS\nD\n(dB\n re\n 20\n\u00b5 \nPa\n)\nFigure 14.

The narrow\nband \u2206Str = 0.012 power spectral density was computed from the predicted short\ntime averaged pressure, monitored inside the high speed core, close to the shear\nflow. The regular passing of velocity and vorticity waves by the monitoring point\ngives the observed tones at Strouhal numbers(Str) 0.36 and 0.46.\nUsing linear instability theory arguments(Michalke[33]), Mitchell et al.[34] esti-\nmated the most unstable shear layer mode for a Mach 2 jet to be Str = 0.3598, in\nagreement with the k\u2212\u03c9 model prediction. This result also ties with the application\nof Tam\u2019s predictive relation for the screech frequency[25], which gives Str = 0.36.\nThe onset and initial amplification of the flow unsteadiness is thus a mainly inviscid\neffect that can be predicted by analytic solutions of the linearised governing equa-\ntions. The dominant mode Strouhal number can be estimated analytically. Mode\nsaturation and fluctuation amplitude prediction are non-linear problems and require\na numerical solution of the kind given here.\nThe contributions from the wider 0.01 \u2264 Str \u2264 10 Strouhal number range to the\nunsteady aerodynamic pressure can be assessed from Figure 15.

The\nthree maxima at Str = 0.13, Str = 0.32 and Str = 0.50 third octave bands are\nrelated respectively to a screech subharmonic, the Str = 0.36 screech tone and the\nStr = 0.46 tone. At higher Strouhal numbers the SPL roll off is approximately\n40dB per decade, or p\u02dc \u221d Str\u22122. This indicates that the turbulent kinetic energy in\nthe flow is developed within the narrow Strouhal number bands of the screech tones\nand that the computational resolution in space and time was adequate to resolve\nthe main energy length scales. The spectral levels at Str > 0.5 are probably due to\nhigher tone harmonics in the inertial subrange of the scales of motion. The latter\nfeatures a similarly uniform roll off of approximately 40dB per decade for kinetic\nenergy in fully and imperfectly expanded jets(Seiner et al.[2], Seiner & Norum[5]).\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 24\n0.01  0.1   1 10  \n 80\n180\nStr\n1\/\n3 \nO\nct\n.

CONCLUDING REMARKS\nA numerical method has been applied to perform a joint time averaged and time\ndependent analysis of axisymmetric jet screech. The method separates the mean\nflow from the large scale structures that characterise the aerodynamic unsteadiness\nin screech. It advances the approach of Zhang & Edwards[19] by including a model\nfor the unresolved length scales of turbulence.\nComparisons between predictions and measurements for a fully expanded Mach 2\njet provided a first calibration for the TRANS numerical method applied to axisym-\nmetric flows. The turbulence model was shown to reproduce the mean jet geometry\nwith some accuracy close to the jet outlet. Further downstream, a broader agree-\nment within 10% was achieved for axial velocity. Main features of the mixing flow\nregion were correctly modelled: (i) a self-similar flow and (ii) a quasi-linear shear\nlayer growth rate were predicted.\nThe numerical method with the same turbulence closure parameters was then\napplied to study axisymmetric jet screech. Resolving the large scale motion in the\nflow modelled most of the essential physics of this resonant instability: (i) shear\nlayer instabilities generated at the nozzle lip were convectively amplified (ii) the\nsaturating finite amplitude modes interacted with the periodic shock cell pattern\n(iii) an unsteady pressure field resulted from such interaction that generated reso-\nnance, and (iv) resonance enhanced narrow band flow fluctuations, evident in the\npredicted pressure spectrum.\nA review by Raman[7, 8] highlighted the experimental evidence available on shock\ncell fluctuations as a key aspect of screech. The current study is a first attempt to\nmodel such important physics by building time dependence into shock cell predic-\ntions.\nThe time dependent predictions captured shock cell motion in axisymmetric jet\nscreech. Preliminary evidence was found in the measured and predicted time mean\ncompression regions, where shock related pressure gradients reduce in magnitude\ndownstream of the nozzle exit. Time accurate predictions further qualified shock\nNUMERICAL STUDY OF TURBULENT SUPERSONIC JETS 25\nmotion during screech. The largest shock induced pressure fluctuation occurs along\nthe jet axis. The driving mechanism is the oscillations of the shear layer, which\nis a waveguide for the shocks. The downstream convected vortical structures that\ncharacterise the shear layer motion also display a non-uniform convecting speed.\nThe pressure field is characterised by a stronger downstream propagating pressure\nwave and a weaker upstream acoustic wave. The aerodynamic pressure fluctuations\nare approximately 175dB. The result highlights a risk for structural damage of\nnozzle components in engineering applications and is thus of concern to engineering\ndesign.\nScreech is fundamentally an inviscid flow resonance that is tonal. Multiple tones\nwere present in the numerical model flow that were confined within one octave.\nBy numerical analysis, estimates for both round jet screech frequency and am-\nplitude were obtained. The method would likewise enable to examine modified jet\ngeometries and flow conditions to reduce or suppress screech.\n6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors wish to thank Prof. G.M.
