E 52, 473 ~1995!# report relativity-induced resonances in periodically driven\noscillators. We comment that zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance ~ZDNR! will occur in some of the systems\nconsidered, outline the physical origins of the ZDNR, and propose an explanation of a discrepancy noted by\nKim and Lee between their theoretical and numerical values of the energy at the stationary stable points of\nPoincare\u00b4 sections.\nPACS number~s!: 05.45.1b, 03.20.1i\nIn a recent paper @1#, Kim and Lee have reported some\nvery interesting phenomena in the relativistic dynamics of\nperiodically driven oscillators. They pointed out that the de-\npendence on energy E of a frequency of eigenoscillation\nV(E) could acquire a local maximum at high energies\u2014a\npurely relativistic effect\u2014leading to the appearance of reso-\nnances that were absent in the nonrelativistic description. We\nshould like to comment that while the simple resonance\nanalysis of @1# provides a good approximation under most\nconditions, it fails when the dispersion dV(E)\/dE is very\nsmall, e.g., close to an extremum in V(E), such as the\nrelativity-induced maximum reported in @1#.\nAn approach applicable to the case of very small disper-\nsion has, however, recently been developed @2#. It has led to\nthe identification of zero-dispersion nonlinear resonance\n~ZDNR! and related phenomena that occur in the close vi-\ncinity of extrema in V(E). ZDNR differs in several impor-\ntant respects @2\u20135# from conventional nonlinear resonance\n~NR!, including in the topology of its phase space, and it can\noccur even when the analysis used in @1# would not predict\nany resonances at all @2#.\nAn illustration of the topological change that occurs at the\nZDNR-NR transition for the driven double-well Duffing os-\ncillator of @1# is shown in Fig. 1: compare Fig. 1~a!, which\nreproduces in more detail Fig. 2~a! of @1#, with Fig. 1~b!,\nwhich corresponds to the same frequency but with a larger\ndriving force amplitude. In the NR stage @Fig. 1~a!#, the\nseparatrix of the left resonance lies inside the separatrix of\nthe right one, whereas it is the other way round for ZDNR, as\ncan be seen from Fig. 1~b!. Besides this, for trajectories\ntrapped in nonlinear resonance, the difference of the limiting\nvalues between which the slow phase ~angle! oscillates ap-\nproaches 2p in the case of NR, as seen in Fig. 1~a!. For\nZDNR, on the other hand, this difference is smaller @Fig.\n1~b!# and tends to zero as F0 grows. Apart from differences\nin their pure dynamics, the distinctions between ZDNR and\nNR can be manifested very strongly in the presence of fluc-\ntuations @4#.\nAlthough the analysis and discussion of @2\u20135# were intro-\nduced with classical systems in mind, it is clear that zero-\ndispersion phenomena including ZDNR also occur for some\nof the relativistic systems considered in @1#. The phenomena\ncan be described in terms of slow variables, action I and\nphase c\u02dc , that average over the high-frequency oscillations\n@6#; the term proportional to the first power of the amplitude\nof the driving force is retained in the expression for c8 . For\nthe period-n resonance, using the notation of @1# @energy\nE , action I5I(E), driving force frequency and amplitude\nv and F0 respectively#, the dynamical equations can be writ-\nten ~cf. @2#!\nI\u02d952\n]H\u02dc\n]c8 , c\n8 5\n]H\u02dc\n]I , H\n\u02dc 5nE2vI1nF0qncos~c\u02dc !, ~1!\nwhere the qn are coefficients in the Fourier expansion of\nq[q(E ,c)52(n50` qn(E)cos(nc).

Unstable solutions corre-\nspond to saddle points of H\u02dc (1) and the ZDNR-NR transition\noccurs @5# when the H\u02dc values at the saddle points become\nequal to each other. If the resonances lie close enough to the\nlocal maximum of V(E), where a parabolic approximation\nis valid, the value of F0 at which the ZDNR-NR transition\noccurs ~cf. @5#! is\nF05\n1\n3qn~Em!

Note also that the stable points do not coincide\nwith exact resonances, i.e., with intersections of the full\ncurve with the horizontal zero level in Fig. 2. This probably\naccounts for the discrepancy of up to 20% reported in @1#\nbetween the theoretical and numerical values of the energy at\nthe stationary stable points of the Poincare\u00b4 sections.\nIn conclusion, we comment that zero-dispersion phenom-\nena may be expected to occur not only in some of the model\nrelativistic systems considered in @1#, but also in certain real\nrelativistic systems such as driven electron plasma waves @7#\nand periodically focused intense beams of charged particles\n@8#.\n@1# J.-H.
