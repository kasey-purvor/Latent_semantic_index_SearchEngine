Combining data from ten sweeps of the \nBritish Crime Survey, our analysis shows that public confidence is based less on instrumental \nconcerns about crime and more on expressive concerns about neighbourhood stability and \nbreakdown. Therefore, confidence is driven not by fear of crime but by lay concerns about \ndisorder, cohesion and informal social control. Members of the public look to the police as \nold-fashioned representatives of community values and norms \u2013 as symbols of moral \nauthority who address everyday problems and strengthen social order. To increase public \nconfidence and decrease the fear of crime, the police need to re-engage as an active part of the \ncommunity and represent and defend community values, norms and morals. However we \nconclude by questioning whether a pervasive (Loader 2006) police response to problems of \nlow level social disorder is either fully achievable or fully desirable. The causes of public \nanxiety about disorder may themselves run deeper than a policing response can (or should) \nreach. \n \n \n \n \n \nKey words: Public confidence in policing; fear of crime; disorder; social cohesion. \n \n \nWord count (main text, including footnotes, excluding references): 5,601 \n \n \n \n \n \n 2\nThe primary job of the police is to deal with crime: the ethos, image and mythology of the \npolice are all built around an institution comprised of \u2018thief-takers\u2019 and \u2018crime-stoppers\u2019 \n(Reiner, 2000). Yet as Bittner noted, the remit of the police actually runs far beyond crime, \nextending to any situation in which the use of non-negotiable coercion is required: the police \nare charged with dealing with situations where \u2018something-that-ought-not-to-be-happening-\nand-about-which-someone-had-better-do-something-now!\u2019 is occurring (Bittner, 2005: 161). \nWhen it comes to locating the sources of public confidence in the police, there is a \ntension between two conceptions of what the public think that the police should be doing. \nOne is grounded in a deeply rooted perception that the job of the police is primarily to reduce \ncrime and provide safety. According to this perspective, people judge the police chiefly in \nterms of crime-rates, perceived chances of victimisation, fear of crime, and so forth. This \n\u2018instrumental\u2019 model holds that personal worries about falling victim of crime drive \nconfidence in the police. \nThe second conception is based on the idea that the public perceive a more wide-\nranging role for the police. Two recent UK-based studies have shown that public confidence in \npolicing is rooted in lay evaluations of social order, cohesion, trust, and moral consensus \n(Jackson & Sunshine, 2007; Jackson & Bradford, 2008).1 Such findings suggest that people \nlook to the police to defend community values and moral structures, especially when they \nbelieve these structures to be under threat. A more \u2018expressive\u2019 model stands in contrast to the \ninstrumental model, holding that confidence in policing is rooted not in fear of crime, nor in \nperceptions of risk, but in more symbolic yet \u2018day-to-day\u2019 concerns about neighbourhood \ncohesion and collective efficacy.  In essence, low confidence in policing expresses not just an \nunfavourable assessment of police activities, but also an unfavourable assessment of the \nstrength of local community ties and bonds. Put another way, people hold the police to account \nfor local issues such as young people hanging around and the feeling that local community \nmembers have lost control over their neighbourhood. \nUnderstanding the ways in which people form judgements about the British police \nhas become increasingly important in practitioner, policy and academic circles.2 Issues of \nconfidence and legitimacy are keenly felt in a country where \u2018policing by consent\u2019 has long \nbeen the ideal. And whatever the ups and downs of police-community relations, there is much \nto suggest that people obey laws and cooperate with authorities when they see laws as \nlegitimate and authorities as entitled to be obeyed. Such legitimacy promotes self-regulation \u2013\na more effective way of achieving compliance with the law than coercion \u2013 and encourages \npeople to report crimes, provide information, and do all the other things which the criminal \njustice system  relies on in order to function effectively.   \nAt present, policies addressing confidence in policing \u2013 such as the National \nReassurance Policing Programme \u2013 are strongly linked to the \u2018reassurance gap\u2019 (crime is \nfalling but this appears to have had little impact on confidence), to a public ever-vocal in their \ndemands for greater visibility and accessibility, and to a strident mass media and populist \npunitive politics. Such policies recognise that ideas about the police are influenced by more \nthan the local or national crime rate. Attempts are being made to improve public confidence \nand reduce fear of crime by moving away from narrow crime targets to deal with broader \nconcerns about disorder and public incivility, as well as address issues of police visibility and \ncommunity relationships. It is against this backdrop that we consider some of the processes \nunderpinning public confidence in policing.  \n                                                 \n1 For comments on disorder and public confidence in policing in the US, see: Jesilow & Meyer, 1995; \nCao et al., 1996; Reisig & Parks, 2000; Maxson et al., 2003; Yili et al., 2005; and Sprott & Doob, \n2008.  \n2 There are many other factors that plausibly influence public trust and confidence in the police. In \naddition to public concerns about crime, disorder and cohesion, these include: mass media coverage; \nknowledge and awareness of police activity (primarily through police visibility and accessibility); \nconcrete public encounters with the police; broader social change (decreasing deference to authority, \ndeclining trust in social institutions); and high-profile scandals and tensions between the public and the \npolice.  \n 3\n \nExplaining trends and trajectories in public confidence in policing \nSince 1982 the British Crime Survey (BCS) has asked respondents: \u2018How good or bad a job \ndo you think the local police are doing?\u2019 Time-series data from 1984 to 2005\/06 suggest a \ndecline in confidence over the years, albeit with a recent stabilisation (Figure 1).3 The 1980s \nand early 1990s saw a clear increase in public dissatisfaction with local policing. In 1984, 11 \nper cent of respondents reported that the local police were doing either a \u2018fairly\u2019 or \u2018very\u2019 \npoor job. By 1988 this figure was 16 per cent, and by 1994 it was 20 per cent. Rates of \ndissatisfaction increased again at the turn of the millennium, to reach 25 per cent in 2001\/02. \nSince then dissatisfaction appears to have fallen somewhat, although direct comparisons are \nrendered difficult by the change in the question format. There is also some evidence of an \nincrease in satisfaction in recent years, although the most recent 2006\/07 BCS data suggest \nthat the proportion of people saying their local police did a good or excellent job was \nunchanged from 2005\/06, at 51 per cent (Nicholas & Flatley, 2008). Overall, however, since \n1984 England and Wales has seen a decrease in public confidence in policing, with most of \nthe decline happening in the 1980s and the rest of the fall occurring in the late-1990s and \nearly 2000s.  \n \nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nA range of explanations for a long-term decline has been proposed (e.g. Loader & \nMulcahy, 2003; Hough, 2003; Reiner, 2000). First, the past few decades have seen massive \nchanges in society. During the 1970s and early 1980s \u2013 and in the context of soaring inflation, \nrising unemployment, and increasing levels of industrial and social conflict \u2013 the police were \noften called upon at particular moments of discord; tense and troubled relations often \ndeveloped between the police and particular communities. Second, the police service itself \nhas changed from a parochial and local set of forces to a complex bureaucratic organisation; \nthe public may see the police as less visible and accessible than they once were (Fitzgerald et \nal., 2002; Hough, 2003, 2007). Third, well-publicised cases of corruption, abuse of rights and \nother scandals have damaged the reputation of the police (Reiner, 2000; Loader & Mulcahy, \n2003). Finally, crime in England and Wales increased from the 1950s onwards (although it \nhas fallen since the mid 1990s). Crime has moved from a problem that mainly afflicted the \npoor to a daily consideration for many people (Garland, 2001).  \n \nInstrumental and expressive perspectives in public confidence in policing \nIncreasing levels of direct and indirect experience, the mass media raising the salience of \ncrime and thereby \u2018institutionalising\u2019 public concern, and the growing visibility of signs of \ncrime in the form of physical incivilities, such as vandalism, and social incivilities \u2013 all these \nfactors helped bring an awareness of crime into people\u2019s everyday lives. In the circumstances \nof increased crime and increased visibility of crime and disorder, confidence in the police \nseems almost bound to suffer. \nConsistent with this, it is often assumed that a key influence on confidence in policing \nis public judgement on the severity of the crime problem, as well as public anxieties about \nvictimisation. The expectation here is that confidence suffers when people are worried about \nfalling victim to crime: people look to the police for protection; fear of crime leads them to \njudge the police as ineffective and failing to fulfil its most basic purpose. Following Tyler & \nBoeckmann (1997), we use the term \u2018instrumental\u2019 to describe this idea \u2013 not because other \norientations toward the police may not be instrumental in character \u2013 but because it suggests a \nstraightforward relationship between an idea of the police role, perceptions of performance, \nand public confidence.  \n                                                 \n3 However, a question with revised response categories was introduced in 2003\/04, and the old question \nwas dropped from 2004\/05 onwards, meaning that data from later years are not directly comparable \nwith those from earlier periods. \n 4\nHow might this \u2018instrumental\u2019 perspective on public opinion help us explain recent \npatterns in crime and public confidence? Crime has certainly been falling for over a decade \nwith little comparable uplift in confidence. People are generally unrealistic about the extent of \ncrime \u2013 perhaps no surprise given sensational mass media coverage, shrill political rhetoric, \nand little public faith in official statistics. According to the instrumental perspective, it is the \nerroneous sense of the crime problem that leads to an inflated sense of fear that then erodes \nconfidence. The subsequent effect of fear of crime on public confidence in policing may mean \nthat \u2013 in the end \u2013 the police are judged on the basis of ill-informed anxieties about crime and \nrisk: confidence in policing may therefore suffer because the public does not \u2018feel\u2019 any \nimprovements in crime.  \nIf it is indeed fear of crime that has driven the decline in public confidence in policing \nover the past decade, one would expect a rise in fear of crime of that period of time. Yet \ntrends in fear of crime and beliefs about crime actually depart from the recent trends in \nconfidence. Relying again on the BCS, Figure 2 shows changes in levels of crime, public \nconfidence in policing, lay beliefs about crime, and fear of crime over the past decade, all \nindexed at 1994 levels. The percentage of respondents who think crime has risen over the past \ntwo years has in fact decreased, mirroring the fall in crime. Strikingly, fear of crime also \nimproved while confidence deteriorated. Thus the explanation for recent changes in public \nconfidence in the effectiveness of the police seems to be something other than mere mistaken \nbelief and public fears of victimisation. \n \nFIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nIn fact Figure 2 suggests a quite different stimulus for changes in public confidence. \nWith anti-social behaviour featuring prominently on the policy agenda, it may be that it is \npublic concern about incivilities which is paramount. Crucially, judgement of disorder is the \none aspect of public opinion that has echoed changing levels of public confidence in policing \nover the last decade. Lay concern about disorder increased \u2013 and confidence fell \u2013 between \n1998 and 2002\/03. Similarly, disorder concerns fell and confidence increased between \n2002\/03 and 2003\/04. Disorder \u2013 teenagers hanging around, litter, vandalism and graffiti \u2013  \nmay indeed be an important driver of public confidence in policing. \nHowever Figure 2 can only hint at likely explanations. To pursue this properly we \nneed a more systematic approach, we need high-quality data, and we need a theoretical \nframework to guide the analysis and interpretation. To this end, we next assess whether it is \nthat satisfaction with the police is influenced more by concerns about disorder than by beliefs \nabout crime or the fear of crime. \n \nAn expressive perspective on public confidence in the police? \nThe idea of a symbolic or expressive orientation toward policing is rooted in the moral \nsignificance of rule-breaking behaviour (Tyler & Boeckmann, 1997; Jackson & Sunshine, \n2007). This approach suggests that rule-breaking is an affront to shared values and norms, and \nthat people base their opinion of the police not on whether they fear for their own safety or \ntheir sense of the crime problem, but on the extent to which they believe the police are \naddressing the moral consequences of rule-breaking behaviour. Crucially, such concerns are \nintimately bound up with ideas about social cohesion, community effectiveness, and local \ndisorder (Jackson & Bradford, 2008). \nThe expressive perspective proposes that the police are viewed as representatives and \nguardians of the community. Individuals look to the police to strengthen moral structures. It \nfollows that when signs of social breakdown are evident, the police will be judged \naccordingly, beyond and despite what is happening to crime. \u2018[The] police are not just the \nsimple protectors of the community, they are constantly and actively engaged in the \nconstruction and reconstruction of the moral and social order\u2019 (Lofthouse, 1996: 44, \nemphasis added).  \nAccording to this perspective, more day-to-day concerns over anti-social behaviour, \ndisorder and incivilities, signs of low community cohesion, and declines in moral authority \n 5\nmove toward the foreground of public confidence in policing. In part this is because these \nthings loom larger in most people\u2019s lives than do more serious crimes. People look on the \npolice less as super-cops roaring past in patrol cars to the scene of a bank robbery and more as \nold-fashioned representatives of community values and norms \u2013 symbols of moral authority \u2013 \nthere to address more everyday problems. Might it be that the public are actually more in tune \nwith \u2013 and place value on \u2013 the reality of police work as defined by Bittner?  \nThis expressive perspective already finds support in work from the US (Tyler & \nBoeckmann, 1997; cf Cao et al., 1996; Reisig & Parks, 2000; Sprott & Doob, 2008) and the \nUK (Jackson, 2004, Jackson & Sunshine, 2007, Jackson et al., 2007; Jackson & Bradford, \n2008). These studies suggest that when the right-wing press highlights ASB, \u2018youths hanging \naround,\u2019 and public drunkenness, it touches a  public nerve which links anxieties about the \npace and direction of social change to more local worries about neighbourhood disorder and \ncohesion (as distinct from anxieties about crime). Further research suggests that public \nconfidence in policing is less about the effectiveness of police services and more about both \nprocedural fairness and identification with group values (Tyler, 1990, Tyler and Huo, 2002, \nSunshine & Tyler, 2003a, 2003b, Reisig et al., 2007).  \nA New Public Management agenda which prioritises the setting and meeting of \ncrime-related targets overlooks these issues (Hough, 2007). A \u2018target culture\u2019 may exacerbate \npublic concerns about an inaccessible and withdrawn police force, in turn leading to the \nreassurance gap as the police fail to gain credit for reductions in crime. This is because \u2013 in \nsome senses at least \u2013 such reductions are beside the point: they do not reflect the public\u2019s \npriorities. Recent policy changes suggest an acknowledgement of this, refocusing police \nattention away from a narrow crime-based agenda toward a greater concern with public \n(dis)order (cf. Innes 2004a, 2004b, 2007; Millie & Herrington, 2007). In many ways this \nrepresents a reconnection with some of the original ideas of policing, which were always at \nleast as concerned with order as with crime (Reiner, 2000; Johnston, 2003).  \n \nDelving Deeper: Study 1 \nIn the first of two studies presented here, we draw on data  combined from ten sweeps of the \nBCS (1988 to 2005\/06). We exclude the earliest two sweeps (1982 and 1984) from our \nanalysis since they did not field the relevant survey questions. We specify three linear \nregression models, both predicting confidence in policing as measured by the question \n\u2018Taking everything into account, would you say the police in this area do a good job or a poor \njob?\u2019 Respondents are asked to use a four point scale ranging from 1 = \u2018very good\u2019 to 4 = \n\u2018very poor\u2019 to make their judgement.4  \nModel A uses an indicator of worry about crime as the key explanatory variable, \nrepresenting the instrumental model described above. Model B represents the expressive \nmodel and uses indicators of social cohesion and perceived disorder as the key measures. \nModel C includes both sets of key explanatory variables to test whether the two models make \ncomplementary contributions.  \nThe key explanatory variable in Model A (the instrumental model) is a latent trait \nscore of fear of crime (respondents\u2019 worry about burglary, mugging, a personal attack, being \ninsulted or pestered by a stranger, and \u2013 for female respondents only \u2013 being raped).5 Because \n                                                 \n4 Since 2003\/04 the rating changed to a five-point scale, ranging from 1=\u2019excellent\u2019 to 5=\u2019very poor.\u2019 \nWe therefore standardised responses to both scales (i.e. in all sweeps from 1988 to 2005\/06) to a mean \nof zero and a standard deviation of one. The translation onto this single scale allows us to compare and \nanalyse responses to the old and the new scale within the same regression model. \n5 We measure fear of crime using the standard survey questions (e.g. Hough, 1995) that are available \nacross the 10 sweeps of the BCS. We should note, however, that recent research (Farrall et al 2006; \nJackson et al., 2007) has differentiated between everyday worry \u2013 those rare moments of emotion \nregarding threats to personal security \u2013 and a more common diffuse or ambient anxiety about crime, a \nfeeling that \u2018it could happen\u2019 and a broader expression of concerns over neighbourhood stability, \ncivility, cohesion, social relations and trust.  To disentangle fear of crime in this way, one needs \nmeasures of both the overall intensity of worry about crime and the frequency of past events of worry \n(Farrall & Gadd, 2004; Gray et al., 2008; cf. Hough, 2004; Farrall, 2004). Other work has shown that \n 6\nnot all of these items were included in all sweeps and only female respondents were asked \nabout rape, a large number of respondents had missing values on at least one of these items. \nTo calculate valid scores for each respondent despite this obstacle, an ordinal latent trait \nmodel was fitted using Full Information Maximum Likelihood estimation. \nThe key explanatory variables introduced in Model B (the expressive model) are \nsocial cohesion and perceived disorder in the local area. Social cohesion is measured by the \nrespondent\u2019s perception of whether they are living in an area in which people do things \ntogether and try to help each other, or an area in which people mostly \u2018go their own way\u2019. A \nlatent trait score of perceived disorder is calculated based on respondents rating of the \nfollowing signs of social or physical decay as common or a problem in their local area: \nvandalism, rubbish in the streets, people being drunk or rowdy in public places, and teenagers \nhanging around on the streets. As with worry about crime, the score was calculated using the \nsame FIML estimation procedure in an ordinal latent trait model.  \nAll models control for the following set of socio-demographic variables: gender, age, \nethnicity, income, car ownership, victimisation within the last year, and the year of survey. To \ncorrect for unequal sampling probabilities, household size and whether the respondents lives \nis in an inner-city area (or not) are also included in the model. Dummy variables for each \nsurvey sweep capture changes over time and control for all other differences between the \nsweeps that might have affected the survey response (for example, changes to survey \nmethodology).  \n \nTABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nTable 1 presents the results. Model A shows that higher levels of fear are significantly \nassociated with lower levels of confidence, thus providing support for the instrumental model. \nModel B provides evidence in support of the expressive model: perceived disorder and social \ncohesion have a significant and substantial effect on confidence and low levels of perceived \ncohesion and high levels of perceived disorder go along with this. Thus it appears that \nconfidence is both instrumental and expressive. People judge the police on the basis of both \ninstrumental concerns about the risk of crime and more expressive concerns about the health \nof group life in their local neighbourhood.  \nYet Model C pits the two explanations against one another, and the results reveal that \nthe unique contribution of fear on confidence is much lower once expressive drivers are taken \ninto account. About three quarters of the effect of fear on confidence is explained by the \nexpressive drivers. In turn, expressive drivers fully retain their explanatory power when fear \nis taken into account. \nThis finding is consistent with two other UK-based studies (Jackson & Sunshine, \n2007; Jackson & Bradford, 2008), and totting up the evidence from these three pieces of \nempirical work, it seems to be that both fear of crime and confidence in policing are \ndependent upon public assessments of neighbourhood disorder and cohesion. Individuals \nmake judgements about the order and disorder of their neighbourhood (a sense of control over \nthe streets that is eroded by young people hanging around, by litter and graffiti, and by a \nfeeling that the community has lost control over its members and over certain \nindividuals\/groups who occupy public space), the extent to which people trust and support \none another, and whether individuals lack the appropriate norms and values. These diagnoses \nof social order and moral consensus shape inferences about crime and inferences about the \nability of the local police to impose authority and ordered behaviour. \nFinally, turning to the control variables, being young, male, white, living in an inner-\ncity area and on a lower income, as well as having recent victimisation experience (particular \nof a violent crime against the person) all contribute to less favourable views. Interestingly, the \n                                                                                                                                            \nmales are not always very forthcoming when reporting their worries about crime (Sutton & Farrall, \n2005, 2008). Moreover, some people when reporting worry actually mean that they take precautions, \nthat these precautions make them feel safer, and that their quality of life is not reduced by their worries \nor their precautions (Jackson & Gray, 2008).  \n 7\nfull set of key and control variables do not fully explain the development in confidence over \ntime. Net of the effect of changes in instrumental and expressive drivers of confidence, \nvictimisation, police contact and socio-demographic make-up, confidence was significantly \nhigher in the early nineties and experienced another temporary peak in 2000. \n \nBroadening Out: Study 2 \nDespite the obvious strengths of the data \u2013 which span 10 sweeps of the BCS \u2013 the results of \nStudy 1 are hampered somewhat by the reliance on single-item measures of confidence and \nsocial cohesion. To address this issue and replicate the analysis, Study 2 draws on data from \nsix quarters (2005\/06 and the first half of 2006\/07) of the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Public \nAttitudes Survey. In particular, because this survey administered a broader range of questions, \nwe can move beyond treating confidence in the police as a single \u2018thing\u2019. Three components \nof public confidence in policing are identified here: opinions about police effectiveness; \nfairness; and community engagement (see also Fitzgerald et al., 2002; Jackson & Sunshine, \n2007; Bradford et al., in press). Additionally, we are also able to disaggregate feelings about \ncrime into two component parts \u2013 worry (about being robbed, burgled and so on) and \nperceptions of the crime problem (the extent to which people feel crime is an issue in their \nlocal area). \nFinally, we include in the analysis public impressions not only of disorder\/incivilities \nbut also public perceptions of community efficacy (for example, whether the public think that \nneighbours can be counted on to help out in dealing with low-level disorder) and social \ncohesion (the extent to which people in the local area can be trusted, have similar values, and \nget on with each other). The expressive model of public confidence in policing predicts that \nsuch concerns will be just as important as disorder in influencing confidence in the police. For \nexample, a low level of perceived social cohesion might predict lower confidence because the \npolice \u2013 being seen as representative of moral authority \u2013 become associated with perceived \ndeclines in social cohesiveness and shared values. \nModel D (Table 2) tests the instrumental model. The response variable is public \nconfidence in policing measured by the single indicator question (as in Study 1). As expected, \nperceptions of the crime problem and worry about crime were both important predictors of \nconfidence, even controlling for demographics, class, ethnicity, crime levels, victimisation \nand contact. Notably, worry played a bigger role than perception of the crime as an issue in \nthe local area. \n \nTABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nMoving to the expressive model (Model E), the hypothesis was that people lack \nconfidence in their local police when they judge there to be problems of disorder, cohesion \nand community efficacy \u2013 not when they fear for their safety or judge there to be problems of \ncrime. As expected, perception of social cohesion, collective efficacy and disorder all \npredicted confidence, each making a unique contribution. Note also that once perceptions \nabout the local area were taken into account, the coefficient for the measure of local \ndeprivation loses statistical significance. This underlines the point that it is not \u2018objective\u2019 \ncommunity conditions and relations that matter, but people\u2019s subjective perception of their \nlocal area. \nFinally, Model F tests how the instrumental and expressive models jointly explain \nconfidence. Strikingly, net of such community concerns, judgement of the crime problem is \nno longer statistically significant, and the effect size of worry is considerably smaller. The \neffect of the three expressive drivers (perception of disorder, social cohesion and collective \nefficacy) retain significance and strength. This provides overall support for the expressive \nmodel: while worry still played a small role, the biggest issues were concerns about disorder, \ncohesion and informal social control.  \nBroader concerns about community cohesion and efficacy therefore appear at least as \nimportant as those about disorder per se; and all these community concerns appear more \n 8\nimportant than ideas about crime. The places where people live also seem to matter, but more \nin terms of perceptions rather than objective circumstance. \n  The final step in the analysis is to bring these partial explanations of confidence \ntogether in one model. Path analysis provides the statistical means to do so. Figure 3 is a path \ndiagram that depicts the five-stage model: \n \n1. Levels of deprivation and crime in respondents\u2019 neighbourhoods \n2. Expressive drivers: disorder, cohesion and collective efficacy \n3. Instrumental drivers: fear of crime and perception of the crime problem \n4. Separate components of confidence in policing: effectiveness, fairness and \ncommunity engagement \n5. An overall judgement of confidence in local policing \n \nThe model states (only paths statistically significant at p < 0.05 or greater have been \nincluded), first, that levels of deprivation predict people\u2019s assessments of disorder and \ncohesion in their neighbourhood (that is, perceptions of the state of one\u2019s community are not \nentirely subjective). Second, perception of disorder, cohesion and collective efficacy \nthemselves influence people\u2019s judgements about the crime problem (people use sub-criminal \naspects that are necessarily symbolic of crime to infer the actual problem of crime) and \nsubsequent worries about victimisation.  \n  Third, we assess separate influences of the expressive and instrumental drivers of \ndifferent types of confidence. Are judgements about police effectiveness driven by concerns \nabout cohesion, disorder and informal social control, on the one hand, or by more \ninstrumental factors on the other? Finally what are the most important elements of police \nbehaviour in overall judgments about confidence? \n  The findings show that living in a deprived area is associated with judging there to be \nproblems of cohesion, disorder and collective efficacy. These environmental perceptions \ninfluence attitudes toward the crime problem and fear of crime. The latter has some direct \neffect on confidence and engagement in the community (recall that worry was not correlated \nwith the overall index of confidence once other factors were controlled for). However, \nperception of disorder is the most important predictor of judgements about police \neffectiveness, fairness and level of engagement with the community. Social cohesion and \ncollective efficacy have smaller roles to play, but disorder is key. Finally, judgement of police \ncommunity engagement is the other key factor in predicting overall confidence: it has the \nbiggest influence on the overall index and is most highly correlated with the instrumental and \nthe expressive drivers. \n  The most important thing to understand about the model shown in Figure 3 is its \nmediational nature. Consider deprivation, on the far left of the diagram. This predicts \nenvironmental perception. In turn, environmental perception influences worry and finally \npublic confidence. Thus, deprivation does affect public confidence, but this is almost entirely \nbecause it affects people\u2019s perceptions of the condition of their community. \n \nFIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \nConclusions \nThe results presented here suggest that the public look to the police to deal with sub-criminal \nbehaviours that signal to members of the public low levels of cohesion, informal social \ncontrol and order in the community. Of the different components to public confidence, \nengagement with the community is the most central. In practise this means that in order to \nimprove public confidence, the police need to re-engage as an active part of the community, \nrepresenting and defending community values, norms and morals. Dealing with disorder and \nanti-social behaviour \u2013 and being a visible and accessible symbol of social control \u2013 may \naddress both fear of crime and public confidence in policing. \n  Returning to the different conceptions of police work we outlined initially, it appears \nthat the public are in tune with a police role which is far broader than just \u2018crime\u2019 (consider, \n 9\nfor example, the nature of many of the incidents which the police routinely have to deal with \nHope et al., 2001). Crime and risk do not loom as large in people\u2019s concerns as disorder and \ncohesion. To those witnessing them, such events \u2013 neighbours arguing loudly, groups of \n\u2018threatening\u2019 teenagers, stray dogs \u2013 say something about the nature of their society and \nchanges occurring within it. Public confidence will be not only be based on how these \nproblems are dealt with, but may also be affected at a more fundamental level as the police \nbecome tainted by association with a social order which allows such things to happen. \n  Our original question was \u2018Does the fear of crime drive public confidence in \npolicing?\u2019 The answer we have come to \u2013 on the basis of the data we have at our disposal \u2013 is \ntherefore largely no. We propose a somewhat different explanation: that both fear and \nconfidence are rooted in public assessment of non-criminal aspects of their neighbourhood \n(cf. Jackson & Bradford, 2008). People look to the police to defend community norms and \nvalues, especially when those norms and values are seen to be declining (cf. Jackson & \nSunshine, 2007). This same decline creates a lack of comfort and trust in one\u2019s environment, \nwhich can then bring forth anxieties about victimisation (cf. Tulloch, 2003; Walklate, 1998). \n  The evidence we have presented corresponds in many ways to the \u2018signal crimes\u2019 \napproach developed by Martin Innes and colleagues (Innes and Fielding 2002; Innes 2004b; \n2007). As well as suggesting that certain crimes have particular importance for people in \nforming their opinions about law, order and policing, this approach also stresses the relevance \nof \u2018signal disorders\u2019 \u2013 public drunkenness, signs of drug use, graffiti or litter \u2013 in representing \ndanger and a lack of social control. People assess the risks in their environment not only in \nterms of criminality but also in terms of disorder and decay that they perceive as part of their \neveryday lives. \n \nImplications for policy \nWhat, then, are the implications for policing policy and practice? On the positive side, dealing \nwith the low-level issues that people find important may result in uplift in confidence. \nAlthough they are poorly captured by a narrow crime-fighting agenda, serving officers are \nwell accustomed to dealing with such problems. On the negative side, many of the huge range \nof issues people seem to want the police to address \u2013 \u2018the-things-that-are-happening-about-\nwhich-something-ought-to-be-done-now\u2019 \u2013 are not usually truly resolvable. It is often \nremarked that the police cannot really stop crime because its causes are well beyond a purely \npolicing response; equally, although officers may be able to deal with individual breaches of  \nsocial norms, they will be quite unable to address the systemic causes of these breaches.  \n \nImpractical and undesirable? \nWe finish, therefore, with two words of caution. On the basis of what is presented here the \npublic wish a policing response which, to paraphrase Loader (2006), is both wide and deep. \nAs well as problems related to crime itself, police intervention is desired across many other \ncircumstances. The natural policy answer is the provision of ambient, or what Loader has \ncalled pervasive, policing. However, even if the police could resolve the issues at hand (and \nReiner, 2007, underscores that this is probably not the case) Loader has outlined a number of \nreasons why this would be undesirable as well as impractical. Pervasive policing assumes \nfirstly that demands for police attention are entirely benign, and not, for example, excessively \ndirected towards socially excluded or stigmatised groups. Secondly, requirements for \nparticular styles of policing often appear limitless and cannot be met from finite resources. \nFinally, pervasive policing implies criminalisation of activities and events hitherto thought \nmerely inconvenient or annoying, with all the potential negatives which may flow from this. \n Equally importantly, there is emerging evidence that public concerns about disorder, \nsocial cohesion and collective efficacy are themselves rooted in more fundamental social \nvalues and orientations (Jackson, 2004; Jackson et al., 2007; Jackson & Bradford, 2008). \nIndividuals who hold more authoritarian views about law and order \u2013 and who are more \nconcerned about a long-term deterioration of their local community \u2013 are more likely to \nperceive disorder in their environment. They are also more likely to link these physical cues \nto declines in (a) social cohesion and consensus and (b) the quality of social bonds and \n 10\ninformal social control. Broader social anxieties influence the thresholds at which individuals \nbegin to think things happening in their local environment are problematic. Therefore, \nhowever much a neighbourhood might be \u2018cleaned up\u2019 (for example by police and other \nagencies working to reduce disorder and anti-social behaviour), it might be difficult to \npersuade everybody that community cohesion and informal social controls have been \nstrengthened. The question must therefore be: will dealing with disorder offset broader social \nconcerns about social change, community and authority (and might the public see disorder as \nmerely a symptom, not the problem itself?)? If this is the case, perhaps the emphasis should \nbe on crafting a more stable society rather than trying to alleviate people\u2019s concerns about the \nlocal results of social instability. In the final analysis, policing solutions may be sought for \nconcerns about low-level disorder, social cohesion and community efficacy, but these may be \nunlikely to address the underlying causes of insecurity in Britain today. \n \n 11\nReferences  \nBittner, E.
