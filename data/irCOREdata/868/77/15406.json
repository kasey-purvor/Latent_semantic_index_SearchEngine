The \nquestion of what determines access to conscious aware-\nness has been the subject of research interest for more than \na century yet remains one of the most controversial issues \nin psychology. This controversy has, in part, arisen be-\ncause it is so difficult to disentangle awareness from other \ncognitive processes, making it very difficult to study in \nisolation. However, in recent times, a paradigm has been \ndeveloped that appears to offer a new and effective way of \nstudying visual awareness\u2014principally, by investigating \nsituations in which participants fail to become aware of \nsudden and obvious changes in the world.\nUnder normal circumstances changes to our environment \nare easy to spot (a bird flying from its perch, for example). \nHowever, under certain circumstances, even large changes \ncan go unnoticed. Specifically, observers frequently fail to \nbecome aware of a change when this change occurs simul-\ntaneously with another perceptual event. These perceptual \nevents can include an eye movement (saccade; Bridge-\nman, Hendry, & Stark, 1975; McConkie & Zola, 1979), \neye blinks (O\u2019Regan, Deubel, Clark, & Rensink, 2000), the \nocclusion of a visual display with a mask (Pashler, 1988; \nPhillips, 1974; Rensink, O\u2019Regan, & Clark, 1997), or even \na sudden onset that attracts attention but does not occlude \nthe location of the change (O\u2019Regan, Rensink, & Clark, \n1999). This phenomenon of change blindness has generated \nconsiderable interest and has become the focus of much \nrecent research, since it appears to offer researchers the op-\nportunity to investigate the precise conditions required for \nvisual events, such as changes, to enter awareness.\nOne specific claim that has emerged from the study of \nchange blindness is that in order for a visual stimulus to \nenter into awareness, it must first be attended (e.g., Simons \n& Rensink, 2005). In other words, attention is a necessary \nprecondition for visual awareness. This conclusion is based \nprincipally on the observation that changes to interesting \nitems are more easily detected than changes to less inter-\nesting items (Kelley, Chun, & Chua, 2003; Rensink et al., \n1997) and that cuing the location of a change by informing \nthe observer of the location of the change improves change \ndetection (Rensink et al., 1997). This bold conclusion is \nconsistent with the idea that attention acts to select certain \nsensory information for higher processing while inhibiting \nthe processing of irrelevant sensory information.\nHowever, it is worth exercising some caution before \nconcluding, on the basis of these studies, that attention is \nrequired for visual awareness. It is less than ideal to use ex-\nplicit cues to manipulate attention in order to examine the \nlink between attention and awareness. Explicit cues guide \nattention by making the observer aware of the importance \nof a specific part of the scene. It is, therefore, not entirely \nsurprising that calling part of a scene into visual awareness \nalso makes subsequent changes to that part of the scene \nmore likely to enter into visual awareness. A more convinc-\ning way to examine the link between attention and aware-\nness is to use an implicit or exogenous attentional ma-\nnipulation that provides no information about the relative \nimportance of specific parts of a scene. A typical example \nof an exogenous manipulation of attention is the Posner \ncuing task. Here, the sudden onset of a peripheral stimulus \n(cue) triggers a reflexive shift of attention to the location \nof the cue, producing faster and more efficient processing \n 489 Copyright 2008 Psychonomic Society, Inc.\nReflexive attention attenuates change blindness \n(but only briefly)\nD. T. SmiTh anD T. Schenk\nUniversity of Durham, Stockton-on-Tees, England\nHumans are remarkably insensitive to large changes in a visual display if the change occurs simultaneously \nwith a secondary perceptual event. A widely held view is that this change blindness occurs because the second-\nary perceptual event prevents the change from capturing attention. However, whereas some studies have shown \nthat top-down attentional priming can attenuate change blindness, the evidence regarding the effect of bottom-\nup attentional capture on change blindness is less clear-cut. Here, we compare the effects of attentional capture \non change detection with participants\u2019 performance on a well-established attentional paradigm (a Posner-style \ncuing task). Experiment 1 established the time course of attentional capture in our paradigm. Experiment 2 \ndemonstrated that this attentional capture was associated with facilitated change detection at short (150-msec), \nbut not long (480-msec), latencies. These data show that reflexive attentional shifts facilitate change detection \nand are consistent with the view that shifts of attention are a necessary precondition for visual awareness.\nPerception & Psychophysics\n2008, 70 (3), 489-495\ndoi: 10.3758\/PP.70.3.489\nD.

Finally, the \ntask requires that fixation be maintained in the center of \nthe display and that eye movements be forbidden, so that \nthey cannot be confounded with covert attention.\nA clear prediction can be drawn from the biphasic effects \nobserved in the Posner (Posner & Cohen, 1984) paradigm. \nIf attention is necessary for awareness of change, change \ndetection should be easier at the location of a peripheral \nprecue, but only during the 150 msec when attention is re-\nflexively deployed to the cued location. At longer latencies, \nwhen attention is withdrawn from the cued location, change \ndetection should return to baseline levels (or potentially get \nworse, since inhibition of return effects bias attention away \nfrom the cued location). Two experiments were conducted \nto test this prediction. Experiment 1 established the time \ncourse of attentional allocation in response to a peripheral \nprecue. Experiment 2 then measured the impact of this at-\ntentional shift on change detection. Eye movements were \nrecorded in both experiments to ensure that the locus of \nattention was never confounded with gaze direction.\nExpERimEnT 1\nThe aim of Experiment 1 was to establish the time \ncourse of the reflexive attentional shifts elicited during \nthe sudden-onset paradigm. In order to make this task \nas similar as possible to the change blindness task, the \ndisplay was occluded for 80 msec prior to target onset. \nIt was predicted that the sudden onset would produce a \nshort-lived perceptual facilitation at the cued location that \nshould be observable at a cue\u2013target stimulus onset asyn-\nchrony (SOA) of 150 msec (M\u00fcller & Rabbitt, 1989). At \nthe longer 480-msec cue\u2013target SOA, the facilitatory ef-\nfect should be masked by inhibitory processes (Posner & \nCohen, 1984). Note that the 480-msec SOA was the same \nas that employed by Scholl (2000).\nmethod\nparticipants. Six participants were recruited from the University \nof Durham (3 of them female). Their ages ranged from 23 to 42 years \n(mean age, 29 years). All the participants had normal or corrected-\nto-normal vision.\nApparatus. The stimuli were generated using a VSG 2\/5 graph-\nics card (CRS, Rochester, England) and were displayed on a Sony \nTrinitron monitor with a 100-Hz refresh rate. Eye movements were \nrecorded using a Cambridge Research Systems Video Eyetracker \nToolbox (2.1) sampling at 50 Hz. Participant responses were re-\ncorded using a standard keyboard.\nStimuli. The array of objects consisted of a black fixation point \nand six white rectangular boxes (1.14\u00ba 3 0.57\u00ba) on a gray background. \nThe boxes could appear at eccentricities of 11.4\u00ba, 8.5\u00ba, or 5.7\u00ba from \nfixation along the x-axis and 8.5\u00ba, 6.7\u00ba, or 4.8\u00ba along the y-axis (note \nthat this means that no array item could appear within 5.7\u00ba of fixation). \nThere were two constraints on the position of the boxes. First, there \ncould be no two boxes at the same eccentricity on the x-axis. Second, \nthere should be three boxes on the left and three boxes on the right of \nfixation. Boxes were randomly oriented horizontally or vertically. The \nprobe stimulus consisted of a black asterisk (0.3\u00ba 3 0.2\u00ba).\nprocedure. The participants were presented with a display con-\nsisting of a gray background with a black fixation point at the center. \nAfter 1,500 msec, five white rectangles appeared, followed 500 msec \nlater by a sixth rectangle. After a variable latency (70 or 400 msec), \nof visual information at this location. These reflexive shifts \nof attention follow a well-established time course: The \ncue produces a short-lived facilitatory effect that peaks at \n~150 msec (M\u00fcller & Rabbitt, 1989) and is superseded by \na more sustained inhibitory effect after ~300 msec (e.g., \nMaylor & Hockey, 1985; Posner & Cohen, 1984).\nScholl (2000) employed just such a reflexive paradigm \nto study how change blindness is affected by attention and \nobserved enhanced change detection at the location of a \nperipheral cue (which took the form of a sudden onset). \nAlthough Scholl\u2019s data appear to support the notion that \nreflexive attention facilitates change detection, there is rea-\nson to be cautious in drawing this conclusion. Specifically, \nScholl reported a sustained facilitatory effect that was first \nobserved 480 msec after the cue onset and persisted for \nseveral seconds. In other words, Scholl observed a facili-\ntatory effect after reflexive attention had been withdrawn \nfrom the cued location. Thus, it is impossible to attribute \nthe effects observed by Scholl to the facilitatory effects of \na reflexive attention shift. In this context, it is important to \nnote that Scholl did not record or control participants\u2019 eye \nmovements. It is, therefore, quite possible that the partici-\npants in his experiment moved their eyes to the location \nof the cue. A change presented at the location of the cue \nwould then fall directly into their fovea. This could easily \nexplain why change detection was significantly increased \nat the location of the cue and also why this effect lasted \nfor several seconds. Given the well-established associa-\ntion between eye movements and covert attention (e.g., \nDeubel & Schneider, 1996; Hoffman & Subramaniam, \n1995; Shepherd, Findlay, & Hockey, 1986), the confound-\ning of eye position with locus of attention presents a major \nproblem for the interpretation of effects, since it is im-\npossible to rule out the possibility that the improved rates \nof change detection at the attended location are simply \nthe consequence of improved vision at the center of vi-\nsion. The failure to control for eye movements is further \ncompounded by the use of very long presentation times \nthat actually facilitate the use of overt searching strategies. \nFor example, trials in Scholl\u2019s experiment often lasted for \nseveral seconds. In this case, participants can easily move \naround their eyes. Moreover, unless the stimulus presenta-\ntion is temporally constrained, it becomes impossible to \ncompare the time course of change detection facilitation \nwith the time course of attentional facilitation known from \nthe Posner (Posner & Cohen, 1984) cuing task.\nIn order to address these issues and convincingly dem-\nonstrate that attention per se is required to become aware \nof a change, it is necessary to employ a change blindness \ntask that directs attention in a nonpredictive fashion, which \nis temporally constrained and dissociates covert attention \nfrom overt eye movements. One task that meets these re-\nquirements is the Posner cuing task, in which a peripheral, \nnonpredictive spatial cue captures attention, leading to \nfaster detection of subsequently presented targets (Pos-\nner & Cohen, 1984). This task is ideal, since the cue does \nnot predict the location of the target and, therefore, does \nnot manipulate expectancies in an implicit or endogenous \nfashion. Furthermore, the paradigm has been intensively \nchange BlindneSS and attentional capture    491\nReaction time. The participants\u2019 mean RTs on the probe \ntrials were subjected to a 2 (SOA: 150 or 480 msec)\u00a03\u00a02 \n(validity: valid or invalid) repeated measures ANOVA. \nThis analysis revealed a significant main effect of validity \n[F(1,5) 5 7.75, p , .05] and a significant validity\u00a03\u00a0SOA \ninteraction [F(1,5) 5 8.14, p , .05]. Planned contrasts \n(paired sample t tests) revealed that interaction was driven \nby a significant cuing effect at the 150-msec latency, so \nthat responses at the cued location were faster than those \nat the uncued location [406 vs. 434 msec; t(5) 5 2.89, p , \n.05]. This cuing effect was not present at the 480-msec \nSOA [411 vs. 408 msec; t(5) 5 0.943, p 5 .38]. Figure 2 \nillustrates this interaction.\nDiscussion\nThe results of Experiment 1 demonstrate that per-\nceptual performance was facilitated at the location of \nthe sudden onset, relative to the other locations, but \nonly at short (150-msec) latencies. In contrast, there \nwas no significant cuing effect at the longer 480-msec \nlatency. These data demonstrate that the sudden onset \nproduced a reflexive shift of attention but that the cuing \neffect caused by this attentional shift was not sustained. \nSince there was no baseline condition, it is impossible to \ndetermine whether the cuing effect reflects improved per-\nformance at the cued location or inhibited performance \nat the uncued locations. Indeed, it is likely that the cuing \neffect was the product of some combination of these pro-\nthe display was occluded for 80 msec by a gray mask, after which \nthe display of six rectangles reappeared.

On 16% \nof the probe trials, the asterisk appeared at the location of the sudden \nonset (valid trials). On the remaining 84% of the probe trials, the \nasterisk occurred at one of the uncued locations (invalid trials). This \ndisplay remained present until the participants made a response.

Participants were presented with a display consist-\ning of a gray background with a black fixation point at the cen-\nter. After 1,500 msec, five white rectangles appeared, followed \n500 msec later by a sixth rectangle. After a variable latency (70 or \n400 msec), the display was occluded for 80 msec by a gray mask, \nafter which the display of six rectangles reappeared. On 66% of the \ntrials, a 90\u00ba rotation of one of the rectangles occurred (change tri-\nals). On the remaining 34% of the trials, no rotation occurred (no-\nchange trials). On 16% of the change trials, the rotation occurred \nat the location of the sudden onset (valid trials). On the remaining \n84% of the change trials, the rotation occurred at one of the un-\ncued locations (invalid trials).

Each participant also completed a block of 90 baseline trials \non which all six rectangles appeared simultaneously (i.e., there was \nno sudden-onset precue).

In contrast to the RT data, the peripheral cue had \nno effect on the participants\u2019 ability to correctly detect the \nonset of the probe stimulus. This appears to have been due \nto a ceiling effect, since the participants correctly detected \nthe probe on 91.25% of the valid trials and 93.8% of the \ninvalid trials.\nThese data have two important implications. First, they \nconfirm that the sudden onset reflexively attracts atten-\ntion. Second, they confirm that the effects of this reflexive \nattentional shift do not persist until 480 msec after the cue \nonset. Experiment 1 has thus established the effect and \ntime course of reflexive shifts in covert attention. If the \nreflexive attentional shift produced by the sudden onset \nalso attenuates change blindness, we would predict that \nchange blindness would be reduced at the cued location, \nbut only at the first latency (i.e., 150 msec), and not at the \nlonger latency (i.e., 480 msec).\nExpERimEnT 2\nA second experiment was conducted to investigate \nthe extent to which exogenously manipulating the locus \nof attention would affect participants\u2019 susceptibility to \nchange blindness. As with the previous experiment, a \nsudden onset was used to reflexively attract attention to \none item in the array.

However, when the change occurred 480 msec after \ncue onset, there was no significant difference in detec-\ntion accuracy between the cued and the uncued locations. \nIndeed, for the 480-msec SOA, detection was not signifi-\ncantly different from that in the baseline no-cue condition. \nValid cues also produced significantly shorter RTs for the \n150-msec SOA, but not for the 480-msec SOA. However, \nthis effect is difficult to interpret, given the long overall \nRTs (around 650 msec) and the fact that this cuing effect \nappeared to be driven by a slowing of responses during \ninvalid trials, rather than a facilitation of responses during \nvalid trials, relative to baseline.\nThese results are consistent with the suggestion that at-\ntention is a necessary precondition for a change to enter \ninto awareness. The results are unlikely to have been the \nconsequence of a voluntary shift of attention, since the \nbenefits occurred too early and the cue itself provided no \ninformation about the location of the change. Furthermore, \nthe possibility that performance reflected the foveation of \nthe changing object can be excluded, since trials on which \nany saccade away from fixation was made were rejected.\nGEnERAl DiSCuSSiOn\nThe goal of the present study was to establish that covert \nattention, rather than proximity to fixation, is required for \nan observer to become aware of a change. To do this, we \nfirst established the time course of reflexive attentional \nshifts in response to sudden onsets in a modified version \nof the Posner (Posner & Cohen, 1984) cuing paradigm. \nWe observed cuing effects at short (150-msec) cue\u2013target \nlatencies that were not present at longer (480-msec) laten-\ncies. On the basis of these results, it was predicted that \na peripheral cue would also modulate change detection \nat short, but not long, latencies. Exactly this pattern of \nresults was observed in our change blindness experiment. \nThese data demonstrate that covert attention can facili-\ntate change detection and are consistent with the hypoth-\nesis that attention is a necessary precondition for visual \nawareness.\nIntriguingly, on first inspection, our results appear to \nbe contrary to those of Scholl (2000), who observed that \nsudden onsets produced a sustained facilitation of change \ndetection despite the change\u2019s occurring 480 msec after \nthe onset of the new item (i.e., outside the time at which \nperipheral cues are known to facilitate target detection). \nResults\nData analysis. Responses were filtered to remove any \ntrials on which the participants made a saccade before \nthe onset of the mask and responses that were more than \n2.5 standard deviations longer than an individual\u2019s mean RT. \nAny eye movement of an amplitude of .2\u00ba was considered \nto be a saccade. These procedures resulted in the rejection of \n3.1% of the trials (2.7% RT errors, 0.4% saccade errors).\nDetection accuracy. The participants\u2019 mean accuracy \nscores on the change trials were subjected to a 2 (SOA: 150 \nor 480 msec)\u00a03\u00a03 (validity: valid, invalid, or no cue) repeated \nmeasures ANOVA. This analysis revealed a significant main \neffect of validity [F(1,2) 5 5.825, p , .05] and a significant \nSOA\u00a03\u00a0validity interaction [F(1,2) 5 9.608, p , .05]. An in-\nspection of Figure 4 suggests that the interaction was driven \nby facilitation of discrimination accuracy at the cued loca-\ntion during the 150-msec SOA that was not present during \nthe 480-msec SOA. Analysis of simple main effects (paired \nsample t tests) confirms these impressions. Detection accu-\nracy was significantly better on valid trials than on baseline \ntrials [t(1,5) 5 4.985, p , .05] and invalid trials [t(1,5) 5 \n5.584, p , .05]. Neither of these effects were observed for \nthe 480-msec SOA [valid vs. invalid, t(5) 5 0.860, p 5 .429; \nvalid vs. baseline, t(5) 5 0.502, p 5 .637].\nReaction time.

Error bars show 61 SEM. There was a significant \ncuing effect at the 150-msec stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), \nbut not at the 480-msec SOA.\n494    Smith and Schenk\nlem was avoided in our paradigm, since although we used \na sudden onset to cue attention to a particular location of \nthe visual scene, we then used a different change to probe \nfor change awareness. This manipulation allowed us to \ndissociate the nature of the change from the attentional-\ncuing effect that a sudden onset introduced and, more-\nover, allowed us to study the temporal time course of such \ncuing effects on change detection.\nIt is of interest to note that although the precue caused \na significant facilitation of both target detection (Posner \nparadigm; Experiment 1) and change detection (change \nblindness paradigm; Experiment 2) at the 150-msec la-\ntency, there was no evidence of an inhibition of return ef-\nfect at the 480-msec latency. A number of studies have \nshown that task difficulty can influence the time course \nof facilitatory\/inhibitory effects induced by a peripheral \nprecue (e.g., Klein, 2000). The effects of a peripheral pre-\ncue are typically studied in displays with only two or three \npotential target locations that do not change from trial to \ntrial. In contrast, the present experiment used displays of \nsix items whose placement and orientation were random-\nized across different trials. Furthermore, in order to make \nthis task as similar as possible to the change blindness \ntask, the display was occluded for 80 msec prior to target \nonset. It may well be that these manipulations made the \ntask sufficiently difficult to delay the onset of inhibitory \nprocesses until after the 480-msec SOA used in our task.\nA second observation that warrants further comment \nwas the high level of detection accuracy observed in the \nPosner cuing task (Experiment 1). The participants ac-\ncurately detected the appearance of the probe stimulus on \nmore than 90% of the trials, despite the presence of a full-\nfield flicker that is known to interfere with the detection \nof changes in visual displays and that reduced accurate \nchange detection to ~50% in Experiment 2. One possible \nexplanation for this difference between probe and change \ndetection is that the probe target was a sudden onset, and \nsudden onsets appear to be much less susceptible to change \nblindness than are other forms of change, such as the ori-\nentation change used in Experiment 2 (Cole et al., 2003; \nCole et al., 2004). Intriguingly, the validity of the precue \ndid not have any effect on detection accuracy. This find-\ning appears to be in contrast with that of Tse et al. (2003), \nwho reported that precues did facilitate color discrimina-\ntions of sudden onsets. However, the similarity between \nthe probe and the distractor stimuli in Tse et al.\u2019s study \nwas much greater than that in our paradigm (a 0.69\u00ba\u00a03\u00a0\n0.69\u00ba red or green onset among 149 similarly sized red \nand green placeholders, as opposed to a black asterisk in a \nwhite box). Furthermore, the participants in Tse et al. were \nasked to make a difficult color discrimination, whereas \nour participants had to perform a simple detection task. It \nseems plausible that differences in the relative difficulty \nof the discrimination tasks can account for the differing \neffects of the precue in the two studies.\nIn summary, none of the previously conducted studies \nprovided clear evidence for a link between reflexive at-\ntention and change detection. Our study is, therefore, in \nour view, the first one to demonstrate this link unequivo-\ncally. Furthermore, our study also makes two additional \nIn contrast, we observed that peripheral cues produced \na short-lived facilitation of change detection 150 msec \nafter cue onset that was no longer observable 480 msec \nafter cue onset. However, the task utilized by Scholl dif-\nfered substantially from our one-shot paradigm, in that \neye movements were not constrained in his study and the \nchange continued to be presented until it was detected. It is \ntherefore probable that the sustained facilitation observed \nby Scholl was the product of either a voluntary attentional \nshift or an overt eye movement toward the cued location \n(indeed, Scholl notes this possibility in his article), rather \nthan an effect of attentional capture.\nA study by Tse, Sheinberg, and Logothetis (2003) in-\nvestigated the effects of a peripheral cue on participants\u2019 \nability to report the color of a sudden onset that appeared \nsimultaneously with a secondary visual transient. They \nreported that participants were more accurate at detecting \nthe color of the sudden onset when it appeared both at \nthe cued location and opposite to the cued location. Fixa-\ntions were monitored during this task, so the improved \ncolor discrimination could not be attributed to an overt \neye movement to the cued location. Crucially, however, \nTse et al. presented the changed object on every trial. \nThus, the participants were not required to report whether \nor not they perceived a change in the display but, rather, \nto guess the color of a new object. As Tse et al. noted, \ntheir data cannot distinguish conscious change detection \n(which requires awareness of the change) from successful \ncolor discrimination at the cued location (which does not \nrequire awareness of there having been a change) or some \nother, unconscious mechanism that might improve guess-\ning. The data in Tse et al. demonstrate that a large visual \ntransient does not disrupt the allocation of reflexive atten-\ntion, but they do not speak to the issue of whether or not an \nattentional shift is necessary for visual awareness.\nCole and colleagues (Cole, Kentridge, Gellatly, & \nHeywood, 2003; Cole, Kentridge, & Heywood, 2004) \nhave previously demonstrated that sudden onsets are \nsignificantly more resistant to change blindness than are \nother types of change. However, it is important to note \nthat Cole and colleagues were interested in using the \nchange blindness paradigm to establish the special per-\nceptual status of novel objects, rather than to establish the \nrole of attention in visual awareness. As a consequence, \nthere are a number of reasons why the findings by Cole \net al. cannot be used to test whether attention facilitates \nchange awareness. First, the studies did not measure eye \nmovements and, therefore, are subject to the same prob-\nlem as the Scholl (2000) study. Second, Cole and col-\nleagues suggested that it is the special perceptual status \nof a novel object that makes an object onset more immune \nto change blindness than is a change in the appearance \nof an already present object. Critically, the change to be \ndetected, in this instance, was the onset of a novel object. \nAs a consequence, the reduced change blindness could be \na consequence of a reflexive attentional shift to an object \nthat has newly appeared or could reflect the \u201cspecial\u201d sta-\ntus of new object that are not subject to change blindness. \nThe data of Cole and colleagues do not permit these two, \nequally likely possibilities to be dissociated.

First, we established that the time course \nof attentional cuing in the change blindness paradigm is \ncomparable to that in a Posner paradigm. This similarity \nsuggests that the mechanisms underlying both attentional-\ncuing effects are the same. If similar mechanisms mediate \ncuing effects in both the Posner paradigm and our change \nblindness paradigm, it seems reasonable to infer that the \nneural structures that have been demonstrated to facilitate \ndiscrimination at the cued location in a Posner paradigm \nare probably also critical for determining whether a change \nenters visual awareness or not. Second, although the Pos-\nner paradigm has proved to be one of the most popular and \ninfluential paradigms in the study of attention, the cuing \neffect can be small and unreliable. In contrast, the cuing \neffects obtained in our Experiment 2 are substantial and \ncan be confidently demonstrated even in small samples. \nThis paradigm therefore recommends itself as a more reli-\nable tool for studying attention in humans.\nAuThOR nOTE\nThis research was supported by the Wolfson Research Institute (Uni-\nversity of Durham).
