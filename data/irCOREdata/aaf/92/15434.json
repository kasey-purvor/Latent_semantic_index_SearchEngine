A number of academic and popular \ncommentators have named and analysed these fears, and predicted their reach and \neffects on people in western countries. However, these accounts have often lacked \ngrounding in evidence that is mounting elsewhere on the everyday sites where \nemotions and geopolitics meet. This paper brings together a range of evidence from \nsocial research about western fears connected to the war on\/of terror. First, through \nexamining survey evidence since 2001, I suggest that fear of terrorism in the west \ntends to be overblown, and that fear close to the sites of terrorism should be viewed \nas exceptional rather than routinised or dispersed. Second, I explore a growing body \nof research that shows those most affected by fear in the current geopolitical \nclimate are marginalised minority groups. Finally, I identify recent writing on \nalternative geopolitics which points to some original and hopeful directions for \nconceptual and empirical work on fear.  \n \nThe new geopolitics of fear \nThis century, linked to a series of geopolitical phenomena including the war on\/of \nterror1, immigration, the potential of global disease epidemics, and environmental \nand financial crises, an array of new fears have come to prominence (Bauman 2006; \nBeck 2002; Furedi, 2006, 2007; Hartmann et al 2005; Hujsmans 2006; Isin 2004; \nRobin 2004; Svendsen 2008). Commentators writing from a range of disciplines have \nnamed these fears, analysed them, and made predictions about the effects they \nhave on domestic and foreign policy and community relations in western countries \n(in human geography, see for example Bialasiewicz et al 2007; Graham 2001, 2004; \nGregory and Pred 2007; Ingram 2008; Katz 2007; Pain and Smith 2008a; Sparke \n2007). This has constituted a relatively large scale and rapid shift in the political and \nsocial sciences - especially since 2001 \u2013 so that the language of emotions, particularly \nfear, is now popularly deployed in analyses of global events.  \n \n2 \n \nMuch of this literature has been valuable in highlighting the oppressive and \ninequitable effects of globalization, securitization and the war on\/of terror. But \nacademic research is sometimes also complicit in contributing to a wider public and \npolitical discourse which elsewhere I discuss as \u2018globalised fear\u2019 (Pain 2009). \nCritiquing the explanations and processes commonly cited in the new geopolitics of \nfear literatures, I describe their treatment of fear as \u2018global\u2019 in two senses. First, in \nthat emotions are positioned as primarily being produced and circulating on a global \nscale, rather than rooted in the existing biographies of places and their social \nrelations; and second, in that they tend to be discussed as though they apply to \neveryone all of the time. Globalised fear is a \u2018metanarrative *that+ tends to constitute \nfear as omnipresent and connected, yet at the same time analyses it remotely, \nlacking grounding, embodiment or emotion\u2019 (Pain 2009, 467). Earlier critiques within \nfeminist international relations and political science raised related concerns, noting \nthat theories of international politics and security make unfounded, damaging and \nunproblematized assumptions about the pattern and causality of people\u2019s emotions \n(Crawford 2000; see also Bleiker and Hutchison 2008). More broadly, for Ling (2000), \nthe narratives still present in globalization research construct subjects in hierarchical \nand disempowering ways that echo colonial relations.  \n \nIn geography, most of the analysis by political geographers has been ploughing a \nfurrow that runs parallel, but is completely separate, to recent interest in the rich \ntexture and implications of emotional geographies (Anderson and Smith 2001; \nDavidson and Milligan 2004; Davidson et al 2005). There are a handful of exceptions, \nincluding Pain and Smith\u2019s (2008a) collection, and work on affective geographies and \nthe war on\/of terror (e.g. Lim 2007 and Thrift 2007). The latter tends to be \nspeculative rather than examining people\u2019s grounded experiences with them (see \nPain 2009 for a fuller critique). Elsewhere in the social sciences, spanning geography, \nsociology and criminology, much longer standing bodies of work on fear of crime \nhave significant implications for understanding the \u2018new\u2019 global fears that are largely \nuntapped (Altheide 2003; Koskela 2009; Mythen and Walklate 2006; Pain 2008, \n2009).  \n \n3 \n \nFocusing on western fears in relation to the war on\/of terror, this paper brings \ntogether a range of research evidence in order to evaluate political scientists\u2019 recent \nclaims about the reach and nature of geopolitical fear, and to act as a springboard \nfor alternative conceptual framings. Much of the empirical evidence tells a story that \ndiverges from recent high profile texts on the new geopolitics of fear. For example, \nBauman (2006) and Furedi (2007) provide carefully drawn accounts of how risk may \nbe constructed in modern societies, but are problematic in assuming whether and \nhow people experience and deal with fear. Both view fear as a constant, ubiquitous \ncondition of modern societies, but it is diffuse and imprecise: \u2018\u2019fear\u2019 is the name we \ngive to our uncertainty: to our ignorance of the threat and what is to be done\u2018 \n(Bauman 2006, 2). However, neither references empirical work in making assertions \nabout fear of terrorism in the west. From a view of the risk society that, like Beck\u2019s \nand Bauman\u2019s, foregrounds individualization, Furedi suggests that twenty-first \ncentury fear is new, in that \u2018we fear alone because of the difficulties  we have in \nconstructing a moral consensus\u2019; this has \u2018forced individuals to look for their own \nsystems of meaning\u2019 (100-101). He does not reflect on the inequalities between \nsocial groups living in the west in their relation to fear, which significant and \nlongstanding bodies of knowledge about other fears strongly suggests.  \n \nThis paper unashamedly focuses on a range of empirical evidence which casts light \non the new geopolitics of fear (a more detailed conceptual argument is given in Pain \n2009). I want to avoid falling into a \u2018theory versus empirics\u2019 trap: theory and \nempirical work should have a complementary and reflexive relationship. But in this \nfield, there are some sharp disparities between work taking different approaches. \nSome of the empirical studies I review here are limited in taking an uncritical and \natheoretical approach to the issue of global fear, while some recent theorisations of \nfear are limited by their authors\u2019 preference for speculation when strong empirical \nevidence is available. There are political as well as conceptual imperatives for more \ngrounded analyses of fear, in considering what those so rapidly labelled \u2018fearful\u2019 \nhave to say about their own condition, and opening up to the possibilities of \nresistance, hopefulness and self action. Despite this empirical focus, in the last \nsection of the paper I draw together some of the conceptual threads encountered \n4 \n \nthroughout, and end on some more hopeful approaches that promote the scholarly \nintegration of theory, politics and social action. These alternative approaches within \ngeopolitics are contributing to a new empirical, conceptual and political agenda \naround fear.  \n \nFirst, I consider two divergent bodies of work which have examined fear in the war \non\/of terror empirically. Through examining survey evidence in western countries \nsince 2001, I show that fear of terrorism is nowhere near as widespread among \nmajority populations as is sometimes implied. I suggest that fear close to the sites of \nterrorism is exceptional rather than becoming routinised or dispersed. I then explore \na growing body of research with a stronger conceptual basis, which is showing that \nthose most affected by fear in the current geopolitical climate are marginalised \nminority groups.  \n \n\u2018Burning with fear, terror and panic\u20193? Fear among majority western populations \nduring the war on\/of terror \nThe manipulation of fear is prominent in recent analyses of the war on\/of terror \n(Bauman 2006; Furedi 2007; Gregory and Pred 2007; Robin 2004; Sparke 2007). Al-\nQaeda statements following the Madrid bombings in March 20042 and the London \nbombings in July 2005 made it clear that widespread fear among the population was \none of the goals of the attacks. In reporting the aftermath of terrorist attacks, the \nmedia validated the suggestion that western fears of terrorism are widespread \n(Altheide 2003), and government leaders have both sought to reflect this fear, and \ninstil it further, in speeches and election campaigns.  \n \nThere have been remarkably few challenges from critical academics to the assertion \nthat western countries are \u2018burning with fear, terror and panic\u2019. This is despite \nprevious research on fear in criminology, sociology and geography strongly \nsuggesting that events and discourses do not automatically breed fear, and that \npopulations reflect on, put into perspective and resist threatening phenomena (Pain \n2009). To be fair, evidence on the question of terrorism-related fears has emerged \nonly slowly since 2001. We should be cautious, too, in accepting empirical evidence \n5 \n \nas providing a somehow \u2018truer\u2019 account, given the methodological problems \ninherent in many of the studies I discuss in this section.  \n \nEmotions are slippery when attempts are made to measure them at a point in time \nand space (Bleiker and Hutchison 2008; Lupton and Tulloch 1999). Importantly, in \nrelation to terrorism, there is a difference between fear and trauma. All the evidence \nshows what we might expect: that being caught up in a terrorist attack, or living or \nworking close to where one occurs, is a hugely traumatic experience. For example, \non human suffering during and after the London bombings, see the London \nAssembly (2006) report, John Tulloch\u2019s (2006) account of his own experience, and \nJenny Edkins\u2019 accounts of relatives searching for casualties after the New York and \nLondon attacks (2007, 2008). But what happens in the medium and long term, in \nterms of emotions among the wider population? Have western populations in \ngeneral become more fearful, in the way that prominent commentators such as \nBauman (2007), Furedi (2007), Isin (2004) and others writing the new geopolitics of \nfear literature have implied? \n \nAnswering this question is not straightforward, because there is relatively little \nintensive research on public emotions and terrorism. The studies reviewed in this \nsection largely use opinion surveys, and some of their findings are contradictory. \nMany are located within medical and psychological paradigms, which inevitably tend \nto clinicalise emotions and reactive behaviour. Fear is sometimes measured against a \nbenchmark of \u2018rational\u2019 or \u2018reasoned\u2019 behaviour\/feeling, a dichotomy that elsewhere \nin the social sciences is widely viewed as unrealistic (see Lupton and Tulloch 1999; \nSparks 1992). Many studies use the types of question which, when used to measure \nfear of crime in the past, have been subject to swingeing critiques for inviting over-\nsimplistic and problematic assumptions about process and causality, given the \ncomplexity and situation of emotions in particular biographies, places and time (Pain \n2000). As Bleiker and Hutchison (2008) argue, a much wider array of methods are \nneeded if we are to scratch beneath the surface of the relation between world \npolitics and emotion. These might include, for example, qualitative methods such as \ninterviews or ethnographies, or different approaches including activist and \n6 \n \nparticipatory research where knowledge is co-produced with those traditionally seen \nas research subjects. I return to some of these issues at the end of this paper.  \n \nNonetheless, studies of fear have followed recent terrorist attacks on targets in New \nYork (2001), Bali (2002), Madrid (2004) and London (2005). Taking the evidence as a \nwhole at face value, five main findings emerge which have relevance to this paper. \nFirst, fear is only one of several emotions engendered by terrorism. Reporting on the \nemotions experienced by the general population in the two months following the \nMadrid bombings, Conejero and Etxebarria (2007) found emotional reactions among \nthe population including sadness, disgust, anger and contempt, but fear to a lesser \ndegree. Fischhoff et al (2003) and Small et al (2006) also identify a range of emotions \namong Americans after the New York attacks.  \n \nSecondly, fear is relatively high in the short term aftermath and geographically close \nto attack sites, but declines sharply with time and distance. Rubin et al (2005) found \nsubstantial stress amongst Londoners within the fortnight following the bombings, \nespecially but not confined to those who had been directly affected in some way, \nand a stated intention to travel less by public transport. However, three months \nlater, a larger government survey found that the vast majority of respondents had \nnot changed their travel behaviour (Department for Transport 2006). Clearly, some \npeople do not have any choice about how they travel, but the findings still \nsubstantiate very little evidence of fear in terms of changes in behaviour. In New \nYork, higher levels of fear seem to have persisted for longer: Boscarino et al (2003) \nreport that one year later New Yorkers were still very concerned about further \nterrorist, biological or nuclear attacks. Those living downstate (closer to the bombing \nsite) were most fearful. Across the United States, Stein et al (2004) report that two \nmonths after the attacks, 16% reported persistent terrorism-related psychological \ndistress. Huddy et al\u2019s (2002) study showed that while a substantial number of \nAmericans appraised the risk of further attacks as high, only a small minority had \nsignificant levels of fear and anxiety after six months. Murray and Stein (no date, \ncited in West and Orr 2005) report that people in Houston were far less concerned \nabout terrorism than people in New York, while Fischhoff et al. (2003) report that \n7 \n \nafter one year had elapsed, respondents thought that future bombings were \nconsiderably less likely to happen. In a comparison of British and Australian fears \nabout terrorism during the Iraq war, British fears were initially higher, but declined \nsignificantly after the end of the war (Todd et al 2005).  \n     \nThirdly, insofar as comparisons are meaningful, the proportions who say that they \nare scared of terrorist attacks happening in these surveys are low; generally it is only \nsmall minorities of the population who report being very fearful compared with \ncommon responses to crime surveys about fear of crime, especially in high risk areas \n(BCS 2007).  \n \nFourthly, to date, fear as measured in these surveys has been considerably higher in \nthe US than elsewhere, which may be explained by the scale of the loss of life in the \nNew York attacks; a greater sense of panic among the media (Debrix 2008); or a \ncombination of factors which underlie the particular ways American feelings (to \ngeneralise for a moment) interact with global events. Such findings provoke much \ninformal speculation, but have not been subject to detailed research.  \n \nFifthly, although the implications are rarely drawn out by  these authors, fear is \nhigher among certain social groups. These include, in particular, those who are \nsocially and economically marginalised, and racialized and religious minorities. After \nthe London bombings, Muslims felt more fearful than other groups (Rubin et al \n2005). In New York, it was women, those on lower incomes and those from non-\nwhite ethnic groups (Boscarino et al 2003). In West and Orr\u2019s (2005) study in \nProvidence, three hours away from New York, older people and those with low levels \nof educational attainment were more afraid of future attacks. Several studies also \ncompare levels of fear with political and ideological leanings: West and Orr (2005) \nfound conservatives and Republicans to be more fearful. In contrast, others have \nfound that those who are more fearful do not support recent US military \ninterventions (Boscarino et al 2003) and are more pessimistic about the state\u2019s \nability to cope with the risk of terrorism (Fischhoff et al 2003). \n \n8 \n \nGeography has a fundamental role to play in understanding these patterns and, in so \ndoing, rethinking \u2018globalised\u2019 fear. After all, it is well known that terrorism is an \nextremely rare occurrence in western countries. Further, we know that the extent \nand nature of fear is highly dependent on the context, details and broader structural \nrelation of people\u2019s lives, which shape how they relate and respond to more visible \nincidents. For example, the fear of crime literature suggests that when single \nfrightening incidents occur in places which are otherwise relatively safe and \nprivileged, the long term outlook for fear is negligible, and people are far better \nequipped to cope with its effects. Terrorist activity and government brutality in \ncountries where they are more commonplace, and where everyday life is more \nviolent and precarious, understandably create far more fear among the wider \npopulation, as a number of geographers have outlined (see for example Abu Zhara \n2008; Hyndman 2007; Megoran 2008; Oslender 2007; Wright 2008). However, socio-\ncultural gulfs between London or New York and other locations in the UK or US \naffect any scaling up or generalisation about how bomb attacks might affect the \nwider population (see for example Pain et al 2009).  \n \nOverall, notwithstanding the methodological difficulties of these studies, they \nsuggest that fear of terrorism is nowhere near as widespread among majority \npopulations as the media and parts of the geopolitics literature have implied. There \nis even a muted sense of disappointment in some of their conclusions. A study of \nAfrican-American teenagers in Georgia three months after 2001 New York attacks \nfound they were \u2018not overly stressed\u2026perhaps owing to the temporal, social and\/or \ngeographical distance from the event\u2019 (Barnes et al 2005, 201). Those teenagers who \nwere stressed were found to have existing clinical dispositions or conditions. Beyond \nsuch general statements in this section of the literature, there is little attempt at \ninterpretation; as human geographers we might want to ask searching questions \nabout emotions, place and identity in relation to the lives of these Georgian \nteenagers, and develop methods commensurate with this task.  \n \nYet, as the few studies show that have been conducted away from bombing sites and \naway from the geopolitical core show, there is a case for considering fear of \n9 \n \nterrorism in the west as exceptional, rather than routinised or diffused. If we left it \nthere, we might argue for the decentring of the terrorist threat against the west in \ntheorisations of fear. Global risks and threats do not map neatly onto local fears; it is \na much more complex relationship, deserving of more intensive research. \n \nUnequal fears: fear among minority western populations during the war on\/of \nterror \nThe second body of evidence around fear and the war on\/of terror is considerably \nmore nuanced, methodologically and conceptually. Several of the studies reviewed \nbelow aim to give voice to the objects and subjects of fear. This is an important \nintellectual, empirical and political strategy to augment \u2013 and sometimes counter -\nthe conclusions of the disparate bodies of literature I have considered so far. \n \nA pertinent question for critical geographers is who might have become a more \nfearful subject where during the war on\/of terror. Indeed these questions are \nindicated, if obliquely and accidentally, by some of the studies in the previous \nsection. Any assumption of widespread fear tends to homogenise populations, but \nglobalised fear is constructed and perceived as part of the condition of whiteness \n(Pain 2009). In contrast, many scholars have suggested that the war on\/of terror has \nactually had most impacts on marginalised groups in the west, especially visible \nminority groups (see Askins 2008) identified on the grounds of race, ethnicity or \nreligion. Poynting et al (2004) ask what preconditions have allowed the emergence \nof a \u2018culture of fear\u2019 in western societies and its deployment to further certain \npolitical agendas; they suggest it has close relation with and contingency upon \nparticular nations\u2019 anxieties about racial and ethnic dimensions. Locating fear within \nthose populations who are commonly demonised and feared themselves is one way \nof exposing this. In so doing, it is important to be aware of the disempowering \neffects of labelling certain people fearful; it can reinforce the association with \nvictimhood, and overlook agency, resistance and self-action. I now examine some of \nthis work, which tends to be more theoretically informed, locally based, and uses \nnuanced qualitative techniques of investigation, before sounding a note of caution. \n \n10 \n \nSome care is needed here, as much of this work examines experiences of violence, \nabuse, harassment and discrimination without exploring fear itself; while some also \nfocuses explicitly on fear. Many studies document increased  violence against \nMuslims and Arabs in the west in the aftermath of terrorist attacks (Dunn et al 2007; \nHopkins 2004, 2007c; Human Rights First 2008; Kwan 2008; Poynting and Noble \n2004; Sander 2006; Sirin and Fine 2007. For example, Ahmad (2002, 101) charts \n\u2018unrelenting, multivalent assault on the bodies, psyches, and rights of Arab, Muslim \nand South Asian immigrants\u2019 across the United States immediately after the 2001 \nNew York attacks. Islamophobia peaks at particular times, especially during the \nseries of \u2018security scares\u2019 which the UK has experienced before and since the 2005 \nLondon bombings, and at these moments Muslims feel more fear both of the \npossibility of terrorist attacks, and of everyday abuse. Yet a longer term process of \nthe racialization of Islam in a number of western countries has set in since 2001 \n(Dunn et al 2007; Hopkins and Smith 2008), leading to a malaise of routinized, \nnormalized harassment and discrimination (Pederson et al 2006; Poynting and Noble \n2004). As well as physical or verbal incidents, many researchers have documented a \ngeneralized feeling of insecurity and discomfort. Noble (2005) discusses the \ncumulative impact of the \u2018small things\u2019; uncivil behaviour towards Muslim and Arab \nAustralians from neighbours, police, fellow workers or students, drawing on \nGiddens\u2019 notion of ontological security to develop a notion of comfort. This echoes \nfeminists\u2019 analysis of the spectrum of systemic violence, where small acts relate to \nviolence through engendering a sense of \u2018structural vulnerability\u2019 (Stanko 1990; \nYoung 1990).  \n \nBodily markers that are perceived to denote Muslimness, such as men\u2019s beards or \nwomen\u2019s veils, speech, and markers in the visual landscape such as mosques \ndetermine targets and places for attacks and abuse (Hopkins 2004; Poynting and \nNoble 2004; Sander 2006). This emphasis on visual cues means that it is not just \nMuslims who suffer \u2018anti-Muslim\u2019 racist acts (see Puar 2007). These \u2018new\u2019 hate \ncrimes reflect a much wider and longstanding racism (McAuliffe 2007), and enter \nalready multiply-layered experiences of fear and associated constraint for particular \ngroups, as Green and Singleton\u2019s (2007) study of young South Asian women \n11 \n \ndemonstrates. Recognising diversity among Muslims is crucial in these analyses. \nThere is much evidence that women suffer most abuse on the streets (Poynting and \nNoble 2004), partly because those who wear a veil become more visibly \u2018Islamic\u2019 \n(Ang 2002; Hopkins 2004; Kwan 2008; Sander 2006). Although there may be \u2018a \nstunning lack of curiosity about masculinities\u2019 in academic narratives about terrorism \nin the west (Enloe 2006; and see Hunt and Rygiel 2006 on the absence of gendered \nanalysis more generally in the war on\/of terror), important recent work such as \nDwyer et al (2008), Hopkins (2006), Mohammed (2005) and Noble (2007) has \nexplored the texture of Muslim masculinities and femininities in a changing \ngeopolitical climate.  \n \nFear itself becomes materialised in different ways (Pain and Smith 2008b), one of \nwhich is the effects that it has on mobility, behaviour and lifestyle as well as \nemotional disposition. Fear engendered by the war on\/of terror and associated hate \ncrimes can be charted through a series of actions and adaptations of targeted \ncommunities, ranging from avoidance of certain spaces, constraining one\u2019s \nappearance and behaviour in public space to cultural and political accommodation \n(Ahmad 2002; Kwan 2008). Fear cuts across different places, resulting in self- and \nforced exclusion.  In a nuanced study, Hopkins (2004, 2007c) describes significant \neffects on young Scottish Muslim men\u2019s emotional geographies and use of public \nspaces, while for young American Muslims the war on\/of terror and the volatile \ngeopolitical climate has conscientized the daily active negotiation of multiple \nidentities (Sirin and Fine 2007). Such strategies echo those of other marginalised \ngroups in the west who experience higher than average levels of fear of crime (Pain \n2000; Stanko 1990). The geographical bounding so clear in studies of fear of \nterrorism on majority populations is noticeably absent: in Australia, Poynting and \nNoble (2004, 18) have identified \u2018a pervasive landscape of fear and incivility \nfundamentally alters the social opportunities for Australian Arabs and Muslims to \nfunction as citizens\u2019. Meanwhile, while growing spatial segregation between Muslims \nand majority white populations in western cities may be popularly identified as \nevidence of growing fearfulness or wish to be separate, it is more a product of \ndiscrimination and Islamophobia (Phillips 2006; see also Hopkins and Smith 2008).  \n12 \n \n \nAnti-terrorism and anti-Muslim feelings in the west have collided with growing \nunease about the consequences of international migration from poorer countries, \nand especially the demonization of asylum seekers and refugees (Ang 2002; Haldrup \net al 2008; Noble 2005; Poynting et al 2004). Anti-Islamic media coverage in Europe \nand US after terrorist attacks has been partly to blame for increased hate crimes \n(Sander 2006). As Poynting et al (2004) put it, the Arab Other has become a \ncontemporary folk devil, and the media racialize particular neighbourhoods, \nconstruct them as Muslim and places of violence\/crime (Dunn et al 2007). Strong \nantipathy towards asylum seekers, and especially those from Muslim countries, has \ngrown since late 1990s and has been encouraged by government statements and \npolicy (Dunn et al 2007). It undoubtedly feeds into commonplace violence and abuse \nagainst these groups (Amas and Crosland 2006). Immigration, terrorism and racism \nbecome conflated in people\u2019s own interpretations of their experiences of violence in \npublic space (Pain et al 2009; Poynting and Noble 2007). Moreover, the political and \nsocial landscape that sexual minorities in the US navigate has shifted, as \nheteronormative discourses about home and family emerge from government \nstrategies that produce and reproduce fear in the war on\/of terror (Cowen and \nGilbert 2008; see also Puar 2007).  \n \nWhen it comes to the very tangible fear effects of the war on\/of terror on racialized \nand religious minorities, western governments fail to protect the vulnerable, and \nenact policies that further victimize them. For the Arab immigrant communities in \nStaeheli and Nagel\u2019s (2008) study, government securitization strategies have \nincreased fear. Western government policies are failing to keep pace with the rising \nviolent hate crime documented above (Human Rights First 2008). Terrorism and \nracism have become implicated in the detail and justification of migration \nrestrictions (Hujsmans 2006; Hyndman and Mountz 2007), as has targeting under \nstop and search laws. State actions including increasingly harsh restrictions on \n\u2018Muslim-looking\u2019 people (Olund 2007; Robin 2004) further increase hate crimes. \nMeanwhile, anti-terrorist legislation is widely regarded as deleterious to the civil \n13 \n \nliberties of Muslims in the west (for example, see Robin 2004 on the US context), \nwhich also increases rather than allays fear for these groups.  \n \nHistoricising, spatialising, scaling fear \nThe note of caution here is not about these findings, which chart but most likely \nunderplay the effects of racism and xenophobia in the west. It is rather to resist the \ntemptation to identify them primarily in relation to recent geopolitical phenomena \nsuch as the war on\/of terror, which longstanding racism in these countries and \nplaces long pre-dated. There is nothing new about these twenty-first century hate \ncrimes, although that is not to say that these fears can not be viewed as geopolitical. \nAn historicized view sees recent everyday-global violences in relation to the west\u2019s \ncolonial past as well as its recent political relations with other countries (Ahmad \n2002; Ang 2002; Appadurai 2006). Flint (2004), for example, is careful to place his \nanalysis of organized racial hate groups within the \u2018geohistorical context of US \nhegemony\u2019 (165). These entrenched forms and effects of fear do undergo constant \nsubtle shifts; Hopkins and Smith\u2019s (2008) exploration of the recent recasting of \nrelations of race and religion shows how religion is becoming increasingly racialized \nand the politics of fear consequently rescaled, retrenching segregation in the west. \nLikewise, Ahmad (2002) noted a possible shift in US race relations after the New York \nattacks, with some signs of greater unity and cohesion among white and black \ncommunities but greater exclusion of Arabs, Muslims and South Asians. Attention to \nthe longevity of globalised fears does, however, place current day (re)discoveries of \nthe spatiality, form and nature of these emotions in some perspective.  \n \nMost authors cited in the previous section are not shortsighted in relation to this. At \na conceptual level, what this literature contributes is movement between the global \nand everyday in a way that collapses their artificial scaling (Pratt and Rosner 2006). \nAs Pain and Smith (2008b) have suggested elsewhere, it is more useful to see fear as \nmade up of a range of multiscalar influences constituting an assemblage, rather than \nassuming the spatial hierarchy where global processes have local impacts on \nfeelings. For example, Pederson et al (2006), in their examination of resurgent \nOrientalism in Denmark, locate fear in broader political relations between East and \n14 \n \nWest, but as manifested in sensuous everyday encounters between immigrants and \nethnic Danes. In a study of young people\u2019s fears in England and New Zealand, Pain et \nal (2009) find that their geopolitical concerns are relatively insignificant compared to \nlonger-standing everyday concerns. Their participants were not worried about \nterrorism, and black and minority ethnic young people did not view the effects of the \nwar on\/of terror on everyday racism as new. Horschelmann\u2019s work with young \npeople (2008) demonstrates the inadequacy of the global\/local binary as a way of \nframing emotional geographies, and Hopkins (2004, 2007a) identifies how \nconstructions of nation, region and local community together make the experiences \nof young Muslim men in Scotland unique.  \n \nOverall, the evidence is overwhelming that those most affected by fear in the \ncurrent geopolitical climate are marginalised minority groups. Since 2001 we have \nnot seen a new landscape or architecture of fear, nor a seachange in the relations \nbetween geopolitics and emotions. Rather, the research reviewed above suggests \nmore of the same \u2013 unequal, excluded and hidden fears \u2013 being remade and \nreinscribed. The research that has been done also suggests that issues other than \nterrorism continue to be more important. The lesson for geopolitical analysis is that \nwe need to place new (terrorist) threats carefully in time and space, and within \nexisting conceptual work on social and spatial inequality. A number of geographers \nhave explored issues relevant to fear in diverse parts of the global south (for \nexample Abu Zhara 2008; Gregory 2004; Hyndman 2007; Megoran 2008; Oslender \n2007; Wright 2008) where everyday life is more precarious and risky. Such research \nmight be drawn into productive conversation with research on fear in the global \nnorth, as many parallels exist.  \n \nAlternative geopolitics: new directions for conceptualising and researching fear \n \n\u2018Just as the formal actors of international politics have been disembodied, \noffering a \u2018spectator\u2019 theory of knowledge, so too are their critical geopolitical \ncommentators undifferentiated by the marks of gender, race, class, sexuality \nor physical ability. Critics stand at an ironic distance\u2026without having to \n15 \n \ndisclose their own location. The language of critical geopolitics is presented as \nbeing as universal as that which it seeks to create, and yet it is a western form \nof reasoning, dominated again by white, male academics.\u2019  \n(Dowler and Sharp 2001, 167).   \n \nI have argued that while the mainstream critical geopolitics literatures have \ndeployed the language of fear, they have often done so with an empirical base that \nis shaky or absent. Fear is largely referenced by experts rather than those feeling \nfear. The resulting assumptions about fear in some ways reflect aspects of the state \ndiscourses they critique. Geographers have not assumed widespread western fears \nto the same problematic extent as writers such as Bauman (2006) and Furedi (2007), \nbut the evidence reviewed here underlines the importance of continuing to divert \nattention to the fears of the marginalised, whether in the global north or south. \nAlternative approaches exist which are beginning to address this need: tackling \nconceptual and empirical work and, often, political praxis, in ways that avoid some of \nthese traps. In particular, four closely connected approaches have been forwarded in \nrecent years that provide promising directions for conceptualising and researching \nthe geopolitics of fear. \n \nFirst and most longstanding, a feminist geopolitics has been alive and well for a \nnumber of years. Clear manifestoes were written by Dowler and Sharp (2001) and \nHyndman (2001); in critiquing mainstream critical geopolitics, they suggested that \nfuture research should work harder to embody, locate and ground geopolitical \nevents and processes. A well-established body of work has connected the \ngeopolitical with the everyday (Enloe 1989; Hopkins 2007a; Hyndman 2003; May \n1999; Secor 2001) and challenges the idea that the two are discrete scales (Pain and \nSmith 2008b; Pratt and Rosner 2006). Writers such as Katz (2004) and Secor (2001) \nalso insist on the potency of a \u2018microscale\u2019 geopolitics of the everyday, which relates \nclosely to my arguments about fear here. Feminist standpoints, then, are helpful in \nidentifying some principles in approaching emotions in relation to geopolitical \nphenomena and events (see Ahmed 2004). Feminist approaches might also promote \nmore grounding of theories about fear in a shifting geopolitical climate, to counter \n16 \n \nthe tendency for fear to be referenced by experts, and instead uncovering and \nprioritising the perspectives of those who are supposed to be fearful\/feeling. A \ncentral tenet \u2013 while one not always adhered to by feminist researchers (see Stanley \nand Wise 2000) \u2013 is the integration of theory and practice, either at individual or \ncollective levels, but always explicitly. Emotions inform, justify and figure in some \nstudies in feminist critical geopolitics (in particular, see Jennifer Hyndman\u2019s work, \n2003, 2007), although in general there has been relatively little attention to fear, \nespecially in western locations. Peter Hopkins\u2019 work (2004, 2007b) is one exception, \ninterrogating the masculinities of young Muslim men as expressed in their use of \nspace and feelings of security in Glasgow. \n \nSecond, Sara Koopman (2008) has argued for a perspective she calls \u2018alter-\ngeopolitics\u2019: new proposals and practices that challenge hegemonic geopolitics and \ncreate new geopolitics. She draws attention to grassroots movements that build \ninternational relations of solidarity in opposition to dominant forms of geopolitics, \narguing that academics might become involved in struggles where the principles of \nfeminist geopolitics are already being translated into political reality. In relation to \ngeopolitical fears, activist movements and new coalitions that are emerging in \nresponse to terror, hate crimes and community fears are materializing varied \ngeographies of hope (Ahmad 2002; Oslender 2007; Weber 2006; Wright 2008). \nKoopman (2007) herself has explored contradictions between activist stances on the \nmajor geopolitical issues and the micropolitics within activist worlds, in which there \nmay also exist inequality, fear and violence. Like Hyndman (2003), she urges more \nattention to the body in reformulating understanding of the linking of these scales, \nand as a site of resistance. \n \nThird, Kye Askins (2008) has recently used the term \u2018transformative geopolitics\u2019 in \narguing for a new (grounded, microscale) sense of geopolitics that challenges \nhegemonic relations and promotes more positive interactions, emphasising that \ndifficult encounters laden with problematic histories still hold the potential for \npositive change. Such transformative social interaction, in and across places of \nencounter, is also illustrated by the work of Michelle Fine (Fine et al 2007; Sirin and \n17 \n \nFine 2007), whose research combines scholarship with activism through which \nmarginalised communities draw immediate gains. Askins and Pain (2009) discuss the \nmessiness of interactions on a long term participatory action research project on \ngeopolitical change. Elsewhere, Askins outlines the personal and emotional \ndimensions of her local\/global activism situated as an academic (Askins 2009).   \n \nFourth, I have called for an emotional geopolitics (Pain 2009), with three suggestions \nfor academic research. First, we might rework our understanding of geopolitics \nconceptually, to understand how emotions are deployed, played out and felt in \ngeopolitical events and phenomena. For example, Staeheli and Nagel (2008) show \nhow a grounded assessment of \u2018security\u2019 forces a rethinking of the concept. Second, \na wider band of researchers might take up epistemological challenges that feminist \nresearchers have laid down for decades, around politically involved, reciprocal \nresearch relations with groups on the sharp end of fear. Third, I argue for a \ncommitment to praxis among geopolitical writers that refocuses attention on \nresistance, agency and action; again, moving out of isolation in ivory towers and \ncollaborating with social movements. In methodological terms, further qualitative \nresearch will greatly improve knowledge about fear in relation to the war on\/of \nterror; but the shift to participatory research also offers to change the terms of \nknowledge production by approaching this jointly. Freire\u2019s (1972) concept of \nconscientization is a useful tool which underpins these three related goals. \nGeographical research through this lens might focus on people\u2019s strategies for \nresisting or contesting globalized fear in everyday life, as our study of young people\u2019s \n\u2018global\u2019 and everyday fears has suggested (Pain et al 2009). The ongoing research \ndiscussed earlier into unequal fears reviewed earlier provides further examples of \ngrounded experiences of geopolitical hate among racialized and religious minorities \nin the west (e.g. Haldrup et al 2008; Pederson et al 2006; Poynting et al 2004). \nDeploying the notion of conscientization directly, Cahill has pursued participatory \naction research with young people of colour in sites in the USA affected by \ngeopolitical change that exemplifies \u2018focusing on the quotidian to demonstrate how \nour subjectivities are inextricably connected with global processes such as economic \nrestructuring and immigration\u2019 (Cahill and Katz 2008, px), as well highlighting and \n18 \n \nencouraging young people\u2019s potential to affect political change at different scales \nthemselves (see Cahill 2007 and forthcoming). \n \nAs well as fear, then, these alternative approaches to geopolitics forefront hope, in \nthe capacity to contest hegemonic geopolitics and struggles for positive social \nchange, both in individual lives and collective movements. Emotions, in the face of \ngeopolitical issues, are not necessarily passive, negative and disempowering; they \nalready lead to individual and collective action (Wright 2008). This constitutes \nperhaps the most important message for future research on the new geopolitics of \nfear. And, just as anyone who deals with emotions acts on them in one way or \nanother, we as scholars also have the capacity \u2013 and some responsibility \u2013 for acting \non our findings, and discovering new ways to contribute to communities\u2019 own \nprocesses of challenging and changing hegemonic geopolitics. In terms of the current \nknowledge gaps identified in this paper, this might also fundamentally shift what we \nthink we know about the new geopolitics of fear.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nA Philip Leverhulme Prize which supported this work is gratefully acknowledged. I \nwould like to express thanks to two anonymous reviewers, to Joanne Sharp, and to \nPeter Hopkins for his generous support.  \n \nNotes \n1 The \u2018war on terror\u2019 which was declared by George Bush after the 2001 New York \nattacks is equally considered a war of terror by many left scholars. As Cowen and \nGilbert (2008) argue, fear is central to its operation: as well as being a war on \nterrorism it has been, ostensibly, a war to protect from fear, in reality one which \nmust invoke fear to succeed.  \n \n2 I avoid ethnocentric shorthands such as 9\/11, 11-M or 7\/7 for specific terrorist \nattacks on western targets. \n \n19 \n \n3 From an internet statement of the Secret Organization of al-Qaeda in Europe, who \nclaimed responsibility for the July 2005 bombings in London. \nhttp:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/uk\/4660391.stm accessed 4th June 2008. \n \n \nReferences \nAbu Zhara, N.
