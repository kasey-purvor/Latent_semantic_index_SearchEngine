Introduction \nDigital Libraries (DL) are collections of digital \nobjects that are accessible to users via digital\/electronic \ninterface technologies (such as web browsers). A \ntypical DL may store documents, images, sounds and \nvideo media. \nExisting DL systems are usually centralised, with \ndigital objects being stored on a server where they can \nbe checked in and out by the clients. Although this \napproach can provide advantages, such as the ease of \nversioning control (if required) and security regulation, \nthere are also negative aspects such as the large network \nload around the server and the inefficient use of \nresources around the network. In fully client-server \nsystems a large proportion of the resources that are \navailable on the network (such as storage space and \nnetwork bandwidth) remain un-used. \ne \nThe P2P-4-DL project aims to investigate and build a \nDL system that would operate over a P2P structure. \nRather than storing digital objects centrally they remain \nthe responsibility of the individual peers that provide \nthem. This allows the system to utilise network \nresources more efficiently as well as providing users \nwith a greater sense of control over the digital objects \nthey share. Our prototype also draws upon Natural \nLanguage Processing (NLP) techniques in an attempt to \nincrease the usability of the system. Other related work \nwithin this area includes EDUTELLA[1], a RDF based \nP2P infrastructure that can support the development of \nDL's. \nThe P2P-4-DL project is ongoing with an initial \nversion of the prototype having been produced. This \npaper summarises the features that have been provided \nso far and our intentions for further development. The \ncurrent release is publicly available to download. \n2. Building the P2P-4-DL prototype \nIn order to focus on the development of a P2P based \nDL we decided to build our prototype on top of \nLancaster's existing P2P Application Framework. The \nframework has been discussed in detail elsewhere [2], \nbut essentially it can be viewed as an abstract layer \ngeared \nThe fra\nundersta\nprovidin\norientate\nsemi-ce\nexists th\nOur D\nstructure\nawarene\nthe prot\nThe \nprimaril\nsupport \nprovides\nShari\nplug-in \n(resourc\nnetwork\ndocume\nbased ve\nReferen\nand key\nallowing\nwhen a\ndocume\nredunda\nthat we \n Figure 1 - The P2P-4-DL prototyp\nspecifically for P2P application development. \nmework reduces the burden on developers to \nnd the underlying P2P technology by instead \ng them with a set of generic application \nd services. The framework operates over a \nntralised network structure where an index peer \nat supports the running of the network. \nL prototype is a plug-in within the framework \n and makes use of its search, file sharing and \nss services. Figure 1 provides a screenshot of \notype in use. \ncurrent release of the prototype focuses \ny on document objects, however it can also \nother types of digital object. The prototype \n a number of features: \nng of documents on the P2P network - The DL \nallows users to make their documents \nes) publicly available to other users on the \n. However, unlike traditional DL systems where \nnts are typically stored centrally, in our P2P \nrsion a user's documents are stored on their PC. \nces to these documents (based on title, authors \nwords) are then registered with the index peer, \n for a Napster style search system. Obviously \n user disconnects from the network his\/her \nnts are also removed. Currently there exists no \nncy within the plug-in, although this is an area \nintend to explore in the future. \n Automatic document keyword identification - Our \nplug-in also draws upon our existing NLP research \nwithin the department 1  to allow for the automatic \ngeneration of document keywords if desired. A \ncombination of linguistic annotation for part-of-speech \nand semantic fields, and word frequency profile analysis \nresults in the generation of a set of keywords for a \ndocument. This analysis can be either simple word \nfrequency or semantically based and is calculated by \ncomparing the document\u2019s frequency profile to a \nstandard frequency profile generated from a much \nlarger corpus of natural language [3]. Currently the \nprototype is able to handle Microsoft Word, PDF and \nplain text documents. Document processing itself is a \nCPU intensive task and so the plug-in performs this in \nthe background [4]. \nSearching of documents on the network - Shared \ndocuments that have been made available as part of the \nDL can be searched in a manner similar to that used by \napplications such as Napster. Using the P2P Application \nFramework users can interrogate the index peer and \nsearch for documents by providing keywords, or on a \nper user basis (those providing the documents).  \nRecommendation of documents - It was also \ndesirable to make the DL plug-in pro-active, in that it \nwould also suggest potentially relevant documents to \nusers. To achieve this users are able to maintain an \ninterest profile comprised of area keywords (for \nexample, P2P, dependability, etc). Periodically the plug-\nin on each peer performs a transparent search for \ndocuments on the network that satisfy these keywords. \nThe returned results are stored and are made accessible \nto the user upon demand. It was important to make sure \nthese recommendations were not intrusive and so, \nalthough the searches are being performed in the \nbackground, it is left to the user to actually view the \nresults. \nRetrieving the documents - The P2P Application \nFramework carries out the transferral of documents \nbetween peers transparently to the DL plug-in. The \nname of the document and its source is passed to the \nframework which then negotiates the document\u2019s \ntransfer.  \n3. Future work \nThe initial release of the DL prototype has been \nmade publicly available and has been used and tested \nwithin the Computing department as a means to share \nacademic related documents, for example academic \npapers. Although feedback has been positive, there are \nstill a number of areas that we intend to further develop \n(aside from supporting more types of digital objects).  \n                                                          \n1 http:\/\/www.comp.lancs.ac.uk\/ucrel\/ \nRedundancy - because peers can join and leave a \nnetwork at will there is the issue of being able to \nguarantee the availability of objects within the DL. To \nachieve this we intend to investigate the possibility of \nincorporating redundancy into the system, where digital \nobjects will be duplicated on many peers. This will \ndraw upon the P2P Applications Framework network \nmonitoring facilities, in order to ensure a fairly high \nlevel of availability for digital objects (for example, by \nmonitoring a peer\u2019s typical on-line time). \nImproved NLP support - currently the prototype can \nonly generate keywords for a document. A beneficial \nextension to this would be to automatically extract the \ntitle and authors. This is more complicated than \nstandard keyword generation as it involves additional \nstructural parsing and name identification. \nAdditional DL features - the current version of the \nprototype only provides very general features. We wish \nto extend the prototype to include social support in the \nform of user - user communication and social \nrecommendations of shared digital objects. Versioning \nsupport is another feature we also intend to examine. \n4. Conclusions  \nThis paper has presented our initial work on the P2P-\n4-DL project, to investigate and build a prototype \nDigital Library system that operates over a P2P \nnetwork. A P2P based DL system provides numerous \nadvantages in particular more efficiently using available \nresources. Our initial prototype development has been \npresented, highlighting the features it currently provides \nand our future work. The prototype has been utilised \nwithin an academic environment and initial feedback \nhas been positive. \nThe DL prototype along with the P2P Application \nFramework is available for download, from our \ndepartmental P2P website - http:\/\/polo.lancs.ac.uk\/p2p \n5.
