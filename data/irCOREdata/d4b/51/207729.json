While I hold no particular brief for the notion of \u2018network society\u2019, Castells is \nsurely right to foreground as problematic questions of scale and perspective, that is, \nour beliefs, or rather disbelief, about wider social structures. With this in mind, I want \nto look sceptically at two terms, whose interconnections have not always been \nsufficiently emphasised: the \u2018consumer\u2019 and the \u2018citizen\u2019. I will argue that you cannot \nget far in framing research into one without addressing the other; at a time when the \nlack of dialogue between major discourses on consumption and citizenship, the \neconomy and public life, is obvious, we need research agendas (and policy agendas \ntoo) which look in unconventional places for connections across those divides and \nkeep as many variables open as possible. To give substance to this rather abstract \nvision, I will explain the rationale of my own current research in this area. \n \nSome (Almost) Ancient History \n \nFirst I will draw on some rather distant history to introduce these issues. First, from \nthe 1950s, it is worth recalling Katz and Lazarsfeld\u2019s classic \u2018two-step-flow\u2019 model of \nmedia consumption in their book Personal Influence (Katz and Lazarsfeld, 1955). \nTheir research seems old-fashioned now in many ways, especially its prestructured \nresearch field of local opinion leaders (mainly men) and interviewees (all women) \nwhose consumption patterns and knowledge of the \u2018wider\u2019 world the opinion leaders \nwere found to have shaped, mediating as it were the media\u2019s original messages. But \nthe general question Katz and Lazarsfeld raised remains relevant: how should we \nunderstand the actual information flows through which consumer goods and media \nmessages get inserted into everyday life? In prioritising this question, they rejected \nthe idea of \u2018a radio listener shut up in his room with a self-sufficient supply of the \nworld outside\u2019 (1955: 40). That idea is only apparently archaic: a similarly flawed \nvision of the Internet surfer, trapped within her or his own virtual bubble, has \nstimulated anxieties for the future of democracy (Susstein, 2000): I call this the \n\u2018plugged-in monad model\u2019.  \n \nThat model ignores a large region of everyday life: the flows of information and \nopinion that surround the acts of consumption and opinion formation, and the \nfeedback loops that compete for influence or authority over our buying and thinking. \nA bold attempt in media and cultural studies to open up that region was Janice \nRadway\u2019s call for work on what individual media consumers do \u2018as active subjects . . \n. as producers of culture\u2019,  \u2018the point of view of the active producing cultural worker \nwho fashions narratives, stories, objects, and practices from myriad bits of prior \ncultural production\u2019 (Radway, 1988: 361-2). The problem with Radway\u2019s call to \nresearch was its generality: a study of nothing less than the \u2018dispersed constitution of \neveryday life\u2019 (1988: 368), but at least she rejected any closed-off notion of the \nconsumer isolated from production. In a similar spirit, I want to start from what we \ncan call \u2018the productive consumer\u2019.  \n \n 2\nWhy might this hybrid figure be interesting? Let me recall here another piece of \nhistory, this time from the 1960s. Much talk now about consumption assumes an a  \npriori boundary between consumption and \u2018citizenship\u2019 (note that \u2018citizenship\u2019 \nthroughout this article is in scare quotes, to stand in not necessarily for current \nstructures of formal politics within nation-states, but instead for a more loosely \nbounded zone (or zones) of public connection). Against that artificial separation, we \ncan counterpose Albert Hirschman\u2019s classic book Exit, Voice and Loyalty. As a \ncritical voice within mainstream economic and political thought, Hirschman insisted \nthat each discipline undermined itself by ignoring the other. Specifically, economic \nthought studied economic actors only at the point at which they exited markets \n(stopped buying), ignoring the dimension of voice: that is, the consumer\u2019s desire, or \nneed, to speak up about a product before the last resort of exit. Clearly, in an age of \nconsumer boycotts intended as political signals and anti-logo activism, Hirschman\u2019s \nargument against mainstream economics still has relevance, but it is equally \ninteresting the other way round. Conventional political science has always \nconcentrated on the dynamics of opinion expression within existing formal channels \nsuch as elections (that is, voice), but only recently has started addressing the \ndimension of exit: people giving up on expressing voice (stopping voting - if legally \nthey have that option - or else, just giving up caring). Political science cannot avoid \nconsidering the consequences for political authority if the monad pulls the plug out of \nthe wall.  \n \nHowever, the most interesting aspect of Hirschman\u2019s book now is not his correction \nof economics from politics and vice versa, but his overall depiction of a broader \nresearch space beyond either economics or political science: the everyday space \nwhere people try to speak up for themselves or take action, and their beliefs about \nwhat difference their actions will make (if any). This leads to the question of trust. \nTrust, and the frameworks of belief on which it depends, fit uneasily into the \nexclusive boxes of consumption or citizenship. As Jeremy Rifkin has argued, trust is \ncentral both to successful economies and to successful democracies (2000: 244). Of \ncourse, you might say that is merely a matter of trusting the basic infrastructure will \nwork, in the way we trust clocks and the electricity supply. But Rifkin pushes the \npoint beyond formal system-centred trust to \u2018social capital\u2019 (Rifkin, 2000: 245), that \nis, the \u2018connections among individuals . . . and the norms of reciprocity and \ntrustworthiness that arise from them\u2019 (Putnam, 2000: 19). The norms of reciprocity or \nmutuality, of course, take very different forms in the economic and political spheres, \nbut that does not mean we can neatly divide off the effects of the collapse of trust in \none sphere from what goes on in the other. And what of the actions people take to \nrepair trust, to refashion belief in larger forms of connection, when older forms fail? \nIf, from the perspective of freedom, as Amartya Sen (1999) has powerfully argued, \neconomically-based values are secondary to social or political values, then neither can \ntrust in the economic system be sealed off from trust in (or more likely declining trust \nin) the political sphere. As Oscar Gandy (2002a) has recently argued, new forms of \ninformation flow and information storage raise crucial concerns about trust both for \nmarkets and politics: which, if any, institutions or groups can now be \u2018trusted agents\u2019 \nfor the holding of personal information? How can we build new trusted agents, and \nwhere? Can trust in where our personal information is stored be divorced from new \nideas (or perhaps the lack of new ideas) about where citizens feel they can belong? \n \n 3\nThe analysis of consumption cannot ignore emerging questions about the spaces of \npublic connection and participation: who are, or should be, their key agents? What \nshould participation consist in, and on what scale(s) should it act? What form can \nmutuality take? These are some of the questions behind the other term of my title, the \n\u2018dispersed citizen\u2019.  \n \nProductive \u2018Consumer\u2019 as Dispersed \u2018Citizen\u2019? \n \n1. Connecting up to the present \n \nWhere does this historical detour lead us? Towards recognizing, I would argue, the \nimportance of a hybrid object of research which crosses the divide Oscar Gandy \n(2002b) has called \u2018the real digital divide\u2019 between the languages of markets and \npolitics. By framing things abstractly so far, my aim has been to keep in view a theme \nthat would otherwise be hidden by that division: the production practices of \nconsumers aimed at generating, or sustaining, through participation new spaces of \npublic connection, new spaces of mutuality. I am not limiting these to the realm of \nformal politics: by using \u2018citizen\u2019 in scare quotes, I allow for debates about the scale \nor scales on which public connection should or can now work. Crucial here are \nprecisely the possibilities for more dispersed symbolic production (image making, \ninformation distribution) embedded within new models of consumption; possible new \nhybrid forms of production\/ consumption (themselves connected with aspects of the \nso-called \u2018new economy\u2019, although my argument  won\u2019t depend on that difficult term) \n1\n that may tell us something significant for the current crisis in political and social \n\u2018belonging\u2019.  \n \nI should, at last, get more specific, but noting first the obstacle that large-scale models \nof the \u2018network society\u2019, or even the \u2018new economy\u2019, place in the way of getting \nspecific. For Castells, for example, things are implicitly \u2018either\/ or\u2019: either we analyse \nthe vast space of network flows to which all the long-term causal power is reserved; \nor we analyse \u2018local\u2019 resistances to those flows, through which identities of struggle \nare formed, although their impacts necessarily are limited to a local setting. This way \nof framing the dynamics of change diverts attention from the possibilities emerging \non other scales. We should look for new forms of local or at least sub-national \nnetworks that institute public connection for various purposes: for example, Websites \nor portals that collect information for consumption and civic activism on a relatively \nlocal scale, but with a ready link to larger or smaller scales. With these points made, \nlet me explain my own research interests. \n \n2. Tracking the Dispersed Citizen \n \nFirst, I am about to embark with Sonia Livingstone planning on research about how \nindividuals in Britain consider that they are connected to wider public spaces through \ntheir media use.2 This research seeks to avoid all the assumptions that might usually \nbe made in researching \u2018citizenship\u2019: \n \n(a) that the space of formal politics has a higher or prior status over other potential \nforms of public engagement; \n(b) that the space of \u2018national\u2019 connection has a higher or prior status over other \npotential spaces of connection; \n 4\n(c) that one form of media (say, television) is likely to matter more for sustaining this \nconnection than others; \n(d) that the media available to people have a significant causal impact on their sense \nof connection (they may not); \n(e) that people have any such sense of public connection (they may not); \n(f) (as something assumed in the research, although this is not to say I would jettison \nit as a normative principle) that people should have any sense of wider public \nconnection beyond the immediate context of their everyday lives.  \n \nBy leaving open as many variables as possible,3 we would like, more positively, to \nrespect people\u2019s own capacity to reflect critically on these difficult issues. There is no \nvalue any more, if there ever was, in research that assumes the researcher somehow \nhas a radically different and \u2018better\u2019 perspective on the problems of everyday life. \nListening to people\u2019s reflexivity means acknowledging that those we research may \nface many of the same puzzles as us, the researchers, particularly about the nature of \nthe spaces to which we supposedly \u2018belong\u2019. This is the research standpoint George \nMarcus has recently called \u2018complicity\u2019 (Marcus, 1999, discussed in Couldry \n(forthcoming)). As Marcus argues, a good way to express what is at stake in \ncontemporary \u2018ethnographic\u2019 encounters is a \u2018mutual curiosity and anxiety\u2019 felt by \nboth researcher and researched \u2018about their relationship to a \u201cthird\u201d \u2013 that is, to the \nsites elsewhere that affect, or even determine, their experiences or knowledges here\u2019 \n(Marcus, 1999: 101). If \u2018citizenship\u2019 is now potentially dispersed across many \npractices and sites, then research must, in that spirit of complicity, be open to a range \nof images, languages and models of connection. The plugged-in monad, taking his or \nher nightly fix of publicly sponsored national news, cannot be artificially privileged, \nunless we exclude precisely what is at issue: the uncertain processes through which \npeople are seeking public connections and public agency4 in new forms, including in \nthe consumption domain. \n \n3. New Networks of Trust \n \nThe research just described is a large-scale project combining local interviews with a \nbroader survey. At a time of uncertainty about research agendas and priorities, \nhowever, this conventional approach needs to be supplemented with smaller-scale \nresearch that follows up local possibilities and innovations. So I am also interested in \nparticular settings where people are generating new contexts of public communication \nand trust, whether as frameworks primarily for consumption or for citizenship \nparticipation (or both). Here the productive and distributional potential of the Internet \nis central without excluding the importance of other media.  \n \nIn mapping out my own wider research priorities here, I have found very useful the \nwork of sociologist Robert Wuthnow on what is truly ancient history: the long-term \nembedding of the printed book into social life in Western Europe and North America \nin the 17th and 18th centuries. The technological innovation of the printed book \nformat is just the start of Wuthnow\u2019s analysis, which explores how over time (a long \ntime) new forms of \u2018institutional framework\u2019 developed for reading and exchanging \ninformation obtained through books (new forms of church, school, political party), \nand new \u2018action sequences\u2019 developed as individuals organised their time and \nbehaviour around the ready availability of printed books, newspapers and pamphlets \n(Wuthnow, 1987: 7). But of course we are only at the very beginning of the parallel \n 5\ninstitutional architectures that may emerge around the Internet and mobile \ncommunications. Research has to improvise, then, to track the new \u2018institutional \narrangements [that] restructure the contexts in which [cultural] producers  and their \naudiences come together . . . and cultural production [will be able to] take place\u2019 \n(Wuthnow, 1987: 9).  \n \nOne of the most interesting developments here are the new technological possibilities \nfor distributing almost instantly through the Internet not only images and information \nbut whole publishing structures.  Because of software innovations and the ability to \ncirculate them to others with sufficient technical knowledge, some new publishing \nformats have grown extremely fast across national borders such as the highly \ninteractive Web interface on which the Indymedia network is based. This network is \nalready a significant contributor to the emerging international public sphere \n(Downing, 2003). It challenges the long taken-for-granted hierarchy between a limited \ngroup of centrally positioned cultural \u2018producers\u2019 and a dispersed mass of \n\u2018consumers\u2019. The Sydney-based software activist Matthew Arnison has been a crucial \ninfluence here, with his ideal of \u2018open publishing\u2019 (Arnison, 2002; Rennie, 2002); that \nis, an editing process transparent to, and in principle reversible by, readers. The point \nis not just to have readers \u2018interact\u2019 with a distant production process, but to have \nthem become producers themselves.  \n \nThis notion of \u2018open publishing\u2019 has relevance to all sorts of sites, including \nconsumption portals, but its implications for social connection are provocatively \nsummed up by Arnison himself: \u2018on the old one-way system, community media was \nthe exception. On the net, community media is very much part of the mainstream\u2019 \n(Arnison, 2002: 6). Clearly such producer\/ consumer models raise many questions: \nabout (1) the actual social inclusiveness of those involved, (2) the dependance of such \ninnovations on hidden subsidies (for example, a university base), (3) the stability of \nthe new forms of trust on which they rely (by editors in contributors to keep to site \nguidelines and by contributors in editors to edit transparently). Australia right now \nseems a good place to research these themes: not only the work of Matthew Arnison \nand the Active.org sites he has helped design, but also Australia Connects, a self-\nproclaimed \u2018open dialogue about Australia\u2019s future\u2019 \n(www.conversations.com.au\/c21c\/auscon.htm) .  \n \nWe need lots of specific studies in this area, but romanticism about their likely long-\nterm significance is unhelpful. The stark question remains: who uses them, and how \nmuch, in what context and to what end (cf Downing, forthcoming)? Those questions \ncan be pushed beyond the language of traditional audience research: in what \n\u2018communicative ecology\u2019 (to use a term recently suggested by Don Slater and Jo \nTacchi) will such sites and networks be sustained, if they are sustained? Or (less \ncomfortingly) what new hierarchies will emerge in the wake of such sites, what old \nhierarchies will they silently reproduce? This is a topic that cries out for international \ncomparative research.  \n \nIt might be objected, however, that there is little apparent connection between my \nearlier quite abstract argument and this open-ended list of localised research \npossibilities. Where, for example, is the nation-state in all this? Can it safely be \nignored? I am certainly not trying to argue that. At a time when we need to open up \nresearch questions, there is a strong argument for suspending assumptions about the \n 6\nprimacy of the state-framework: what, after all, may be emerging are new forms of \npublic connection within and beyond the state. Even so, state initiatives in \nencouraging web-based connection are themselves interesting, for example those \ntentatively developed by the Blair government in the UK (see the recent consultation \ndocument: Office of the e-Envoy, 2002).  \n \nThere remains, as yet, a great gulf between UK government rhetoric (encouraging \nnew forms of democratic participation) and the reality. Suppose, encouraged by the \nwarm words in that UK consultation paper, you visited the \u2018Citizens Space\u2019 section of \nthe government site www.ukonline.gov.uk. You might well want first to click on \n\u2018how to contribute effectively\u2019. But the first instruction you get is \u2018Be Brief\u2019: \u2018use one \nshort sentence to explain each point you want to make\u2019.5 Hardly an encouragement to \nopen-ended deliberation! In fact, there\u2019s no mention of how you can get a response to \nyour comments, still less a dialogue between government and citizen. We are, clearly, \nat the beginning of developments in this area: we cannot predict what patterns and \nconditions of interaction6 will become normalised, but it is unhelpful to confuse the \nmyths of e-government with any likely reality.7   \n \nSome Wider Perspectives \n \nTo sum up so far: first, I argued we must frame research agendas beyond any arbitrary \ndivision between consumption and citizenship, the economy and politics, precisely to \nallow into view new practices which search for public connection across that divide. \nSecond, in describing my own recent and planned research, I mapped out various \npossibilities, from larger-scale research (on people\u2019s sense of public connection \nthrough media consumption) to a more improvised micro-focus, that, taken together, \nwill, I hope, track some of the complexity of a situation where both the technological \nforms and the social grounding of older frameworks of mediated public connection \n(the national radio and television audience, for example) are changing. New network \nforms are under construction,8 but their effective scale is far from clear.  Imposing one \n(say, the national) scale of analysis ignores the point that scale is always a social \nconstruction, and one with political consequences (Harvey, 2000: 75-77). But how \nfinally to think about the contribution to social civic and cultural space of large actors \nsuch as governments and corporations? \n \nLet em conclude by suggesting three points about the role of such large actors. First, \ngovernments and other major players interested in influencing positively future forms \nof public connection should take seriously the impetus to technical and infrastructural \ninnovation from the partial collapse of traditional frameworks of political and social \nconnection. The French sociologist Alain Touraine has for some time called on \nsociology to redirect its priorities away from society\u2019s grand claims about itself, and \ninstead to \u2018work . . . in close proximity to the emotions, dreams, and wounds of all \nthose who assume the lives of [social] actors but are not acknowledged as such\u2019 \n(Touraine, 1988: 18). If Touraine is even half right, governments and major market \nplayers would do well to look closely at this space of experimentation also.  \n \nIf so, a second question arises: what forms of subsidy will be most effective in \nstimulating new forms of public connection? Should be governments be more active \nnot just in creating basic information websites, but also in subsidising portals and \nnetworks where new forms of public connection can self-organise, faciliated, but not \n 7\ndirected, by the state? What architectures (both online structure and the social \nembedding of online opportunities) can generate and sustain new spaces of public \nconnection and trust? And for whom? What indeed should \u2018subsidy\u2019 now mean in this \ncontext? Surely it cannot mean public service provision located in, and only in, the \nstate?9 \n \nThird, in helping governments and commercial players address such questions, we \nneed to know more about the developing interrelations between the never-simply-\nisolated process of consumption (production\/ consumption) and the wider processes \nthrough which mutuality is fostered so that community, even against the odds, can \nemerge. The importance of this area (for example, questions of social capital and \n\u2018community\u2019) has been clear for some time,10 as has its irreducibility to formal \npolitical science or market functioning. But its difficulty is also clear. For we stand, \nhere, directly in the gap with which I began, between local possibilities of connection \nand our wider sense of \u2018meta-social (dis)order\u2019.  This gap, of course, can be \nchallenged. The different forms such challenges take in countless cultural and social \nconditions11 requires the international exchange of research ideas, priorities, and \nresults. The inter-disciplinary but sociologically-informed space of cultural studies is \nsurely as good a place as any for such dialogue to take place  \n \nNICK COULDRY \n \nReferences \n \nArnison, Matthew (2002) \u2018Open Publishing Document\u2019. \nhttp:\/\/cat.org.au\/maffew\/cat\/openpub.html last accessed 4 September 2002, \n \nBarry, Andrew and Slater, Don (2002) \u2018Introduction: The Technological Economy\u2019 \nEconomy and Society 31(2): 175-193. \n \nBenhabib, Seyla (1995) \u2018Toward a Deliberative Model of Democratic Legitimacy\u2019 in \nS.
