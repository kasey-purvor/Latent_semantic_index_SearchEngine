Zdruli et al. \n1. Introduction \nA drought is a decrease in water availability in a \nparticular period over a particular area [3]. \nResearch by Wilhite and Glantz [34] in the early \n1980s uncovered more than 150 published defini- \ntions of drought. The definitions reflect differences \nin regions, needs and disciplinary approaches. They \ncategorised their collection of definitions into four \nbasic approaches to measuring drought: meteoro- \nlogical, hydrological, agricultural and socio-eco- \nnomic. The first three approaches deal with ways to \nmeasure drought as a physical phenomenon. The \nlast deals with drought in terms of supply and \ndemand, tracking the effects of water shortfall as it \nripples through socio-economic systems. \nDroughts are usually described in terms of their \nimpact or by their duration, severity and probabili- \nty of reoccunrence [4. 341. A combination of inete- \norological factors, mainly precipitation and temper- \nature, produces drought conditions. Thomasson \n[27] describes drought as a lack of rain and drought \nconditions result from a lack of an expected amount \nof precipitation. \nIn addition to the different types of drought, \nnamely meteorological, hydrological, and agricul- \ntural droughts, the term soil droughtiness [27] has \nalso been applied in an agricultural context. An \nagricultural drought, sometimes referred to as an \nagro-meteorological or agroclimatic drought, \noccurs when there is insufficient moisture in the \nroot zone to sustain plant growth. It can be estimat- \ned and\/or quantified by considering three aspects: \nclimate or weather, soil water properties and plant \nor crop requirements. Soil droughtiness can be \nregarded as an important component of, if not syn- \nonynlous with, agricultural drought. \nBecause of its importance in soil processes, soil \nmoisture is also used as a fundamental criterion for \nsoil classification, in both international [7, 8, 251 \nand national systems (for example those of the UK, \nGermany, France, The Netherlands). A lack of soil \nwater is used to define arid soils and the occurrence \nof these soils can be expressed in map form. In this \nrespect, soil maps can be used to some extent to \nidentify areas that are likely to suffer agricultural \ndroughts. \nThis paper describes the use of soil and climatic \ndata for assessing the risk of agricultural drought in \nEurope. The main objective is to show how drought \nrisk can be assessed at the continental scale in a \nmanner that should be of interest to researchers and \npolicy makers alike. There have been many detailed \nstudies of drought [34] but this paper attempts to \nuse the knowledge gained from research in this field \nto produce assessments in a spatial context. The \nfirst part of the paper describes the basis for map- \nping arid soils and hence those that can usually be \nassociated with drought conditions. This is fol- \nlowed by a more rigorous quantified approach to \nassessing the risk of agricultural drought in Europe \nbased on soil-climate interactions. \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1. Risk assessment \nA risk is the chance of a bad consequence or loss. \nAnother definition of risk is the chance that some \nundesirable event may occur. Risk assessment \ninvolves the identification of the risk, and the mea- \nsurement of the exposure to that risk. The response \nto risk assessment may be to initiate categorisation \nof the risk and\/or to introduce measures to manage \nthe risk. In some cases, the risk may simply be \naccepted. Such risk management is a significant \nactivity in the agricultural industry and has been so \nsince very early times (5000 years ago). \nThe risk assessment addressed in this paper is the \ngeneral or average risk that is likely to occur in \nmost years based on a combination of soil factors \nand climate. Quantifying this kind of risk is of value \nfor long-term planning. There is another kind of \nrisk, within-season risk, that is the result of a com- \nbination of soil factors interacting with the weather \nduring a particular season. This is also important for \nagriculture and a full risk analysis should include \nboth average and seasonal risk. However, this paper \nonly addresses average risk because, at the \nEuropean scale, the weather data for assessing risk \nRisk of agricultural drought in Europe \nin the short term (during a season) are lacking at the \nspatial resolution that is needed. \n2.2. Soil classification and drought risk \nThe USDA system of soil classification, Soil \nTaxonomy [24-261, has been developed over the \npast five decades. Although some would argue that \nit is not strictly an international system, it is in such \nwidespread use throughout the world that we will \nconsider Soil Taxonomy truly international for the \npurposes of this study. The system uses soil-climate \ncharacteristics for identifying soil taxa at suborder \nlevel, which is an important level in the identifica- \ntion of soil types. To make this possible, Soil \nTaxonomy identifies soil moisture regimes (SMR) \nbased on moisture conditions in the soil moisture \ncontrol section (SMCS). The intention in defining \nthe SMCS is to facilitate estimation of soil moisture \nregimes from climatic data. \nThe SMCS is considered to extend approximate- \nly from: \n(1) 0 to 30 cm below the soil surface if the particle- \nsize class of the soil is fine-loamy, coarse-silty, \nfine-silty, or clay; \n% 9 , 6 i o ' % % % % .

Soil texture classes (Schoeneberger et al. 1998). \n(2) 20 to 60 cm if texture is coarse loamy; \n(3) 30 to 90 cm for sandy soils. \nThese texture classes are broad categories that \ncan be summarised as follows: \nSandy loamy sand and sand \nCoarse loamy sandy loam, loam (< 20% clay) \nCoarse silty silt, silt loam \nFine loamy clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam \n(> 20% clay) \nFine silty silty clay loam \nClay sandy clay, silty clay, clay. \nThe individual texture classes are shown in \nFigure 1. \nThe limits of the SMCS are affected not only by \nthe textural composition of soils, but also by differ- \nences in soil structure or pore-size distribution or by \nother factors that influence the movement and \nretention of water in the soil. \nSoil moisture regimes and, additionally soil tem- \nperature regimes (STR), are fundamental character- \nistics that are used for classifying soils at Order \nlevel in the Soil Taxonomy. Other soil classifica- \ntions systems, such as the FA0 Legends [7, 81 and \nthe World Reference Base for Soil Resources or \nWRB [6] also use similar concepts. However. the \nFA0 and WRB systems do not use climatic data per \nse directly for classification but instead use various \nsoil climate criteria in the definitions of soil map- \nping units. This explains the emphasis given here to \nthe Soil Taxonomy to illustrate how soil classifica- \ntion can be used as a first step in identifying drought \nprone areas. \nDistribution of arid soils \nThe spatial distribution of soils in the dry areas, \ni.e. arid soils, reflects the soil classification system \nused. In the USDA Soil Taxonomy, the soil mois- \nture regime (SMR) classes used for separating soils \nat Order level, are defined in terms of the seasonal \npresence or absence of water held at a tension of \n1500 kPa in the moisture control section (SMCS). \nA tension of 1500 kPa approximates to wilting \npoint. It is assumed in the definition that the soil \nsupports vegetation according to its capability i.e. \ncrops, grass, or native vegetation, and that the \nP. Zdruli et al. \namount of stored inoisture is not being augmented \nby irrigation or by leaving land in fallow. These \npractices significantly affect the soil moisture con- \nditions for as long as they are continued. The class- \nes of SMR related to dry areas are described in the \nsections below. \nAridic and Torric (L. nridus, dry, and L. tor- \nridus, hot and dry). These terms are used for the \nsame regime but in different categories of the Soil \nTaxonomy. In the aridic (torric) moisture regime, \nthe SMCS in a normal year, is: \n(1) Dry in all parts for more than half of the cumu- \nlative days per year when the soil temperature at \na depth of 50 cm from the soil surface is above \n5 OC; and \n(2) Moist in some or all parts for less than 90 con- \nsecutive days when the soil temperature at a \ndepth of 50 cm is above 8 OC. \nA \"normal year\" is defined as a year that has plus \nor minus one standard deviation of the long-term \n(30 years or more) mean annual precipitation [25, \np. 331. \nSoils that have aridic (torric) moisture re,' uirnes \nnormally occur in areas of arid climate. A few are \nin areas of semi-arid climates and either have phys- \nical properties that keep them dry, such as crusty \nsurface that virtually precludes the infiltration of \nwater, or are on steep slopes where run-off is high. \nAccordins to Soil Taxonomy, these soils are named \nAridisols. They occur in the western parts of the \nUSA, Africa and Asia. They receive very little pre- \ncipitation such that normal agriculture is precluded. \nUstic (L. L L S ~ U S ,  burnt, implying dryness): is \nintermediate between the aridic regime and the udic \nregime (L. udus. humid). This definition is based on \nthe concept that moisture is limited, but is present at \na time when conditions are suitable for plant \ngrowth. This concept is not applied to soils that \nhave permafrost conditions. Ustic criteria are \ndescribed very precisely in the Soil Taxonomy [25, \np. 341, in climatic terms. Ustic moisture regimes are \nspread throughout Europe, but their main domain is \nin the southern parts of the continent. Irrigation is \nnecessary if good yields of agricultural crops are to \nbe obtained. \nXeric (Gr. xeros, dry) moisture regimes are typi- \ncal in areas of Mediterranean climate, where win- \nters are moist and cool, and summers are warm and \ndry. The moisture, which falls during the winter, \nwhen potential evapotranspiration is at a minimum, \nis particularly effective for leaching. \nIn areas with xeric soil moisture regimes, the \nSMCS, in normal years, is dry in all parts for 45 or \nmore consecutive days in the 4 months following \nsummer solstice, and moist in all parts for 45 or \nmore consecutive days in the 4 months following \nwinter solstice. The temperature criteria for xeric \nsoil moisture regimes are defined precisely by Soil \nSurvey Staff [25, p. 341. \nXeric moisture regimes are widely distributed in \nthe Mediterranean region [ 5 ] ,  occurring in Spain, \nsouthern France, southern Italy. Albania, Greece, \nthe Middle and the Near East and North Africa. \nZdruli et al. [36] have described xeric soils in detail \nfor Albania. Some of the most typical soils of this \narea are classified as Rhodoxeralfs (Soil \nTaxonomy), or Chromic Luvisols [8]. They have \nthe potential to be very productive if there is an ade- \nquate supply of moisture and if they are managed \nproperly. If mismanaged, these soils will degrade \nrapidly through wind and water erosion. \nUsing the terminology of the Soil Taxonomy, the \nUS Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural \nResources Conservation Service (NRCS) have pro- \nduced a map of arid soils in the USA (Fig. 2). This \nmap shows the approximate extent of arid soils and \nit is compatible with the conventional view of \npedologists of where arid soils occur in North \nAmerica. \nIn Europe, typical soils related to dry areas [7], \nare the Xerosols and Yermosols. They occur most. \nwidely under xeric soil moisture regimes. The dis- \ntribution of these soils can be studied using the \nEuropean Soil Database. This contains geographi- \ncal data that represent the soils according to the \nFAO-UNESCO [7, 81 Legends. The geographical \ndata are based on the EC Soil Map (CEC, 1985) that \nwas originally prepared at a scale of 1 : 1 000000. \nAfter the FAO-UNESCO [7] Legend was revised \n[8], soils were grouped differently. However in \nmany parts of the world, the lack of climate data \nRisk 01 agricultural drought in Europe \nDOMIIUANT SCBOIZDERS \nz p g  \n,.jrgid, ..i&?., C!.yic!s 5a1ids \nCalcic:ls Durids \nAJier USDA-NRCS (1998) car3 bids Gypsicis \nprecludes the use of soil-climate properties as dif- \nferentiating criteria. Therefore, in the FAO- \nUNESCO-ISRIC [8] system, dry soil types, i.e. \nthose that generally occur in aridic conditions, or \nare physiologically droughty, are included in other \nsoil units, as for example: the Calcisols, Gypsisols, \nSolonchaks, Solonetz, Arenosols, Vertisols, \nLuvisols, Cambisols and Ferralsols. To plot the dis- \ntribution of arid soils in southern Europe, we have \nassessed the major soil groupings listed above on a \nnational basis using the soil name attached to the \nsoil map unit in the European Soil Database and the \nresults are shown in Figure 3. \nFigure 2.

It describes soils that \noccur in dry areas as Durisols, whilst other related \nsoils, occurring in dry conditions, are included in \nseveral soil groups: Vertisols, Solonchaks: \nSolonetz, Ferralsols, Gypsisols, Calcisols, \nAlbeluvisols, Luvisols, Cambisols and Arenosols. \nIn common with the FAO-UNESCO system, WRB \nrecognises the importance of soil-climate character- \nThere 's scope for this istics but does not use these criteria directly because \nfurther of the units On climate data are so scarce in many parts of the \na regional (i.e. sub-national) basis and by superim- world, where the system is likely to be used, \nposition of climatic data to identify areas of low \nprecipitation more precisely.

It has been shown Soil available water \nthat soil maps can be useful as a first step in delin- \neating areas suffering from aridity. Therefore, such \nmaps offer a starting point for identifying areas \nwhere there is a risk of drought and where drought \nmitigation practices may be needed. However, \"arid \nor dry areas\" are not exclusively associated with \nlow precipitation. For example, saline areas in \nhumid regions are considered to suffer from a form \nof drought because the quality of water prohibits \ncrop growth. \nThomasson [28] has comprehensively reviewed a \nrange of models for estimating the soil available \nwater, often called available water capacity (AWC) \nin the literature. He concludes that a simple \"capac- \nity\" model is most appropriate given the current \navailability of data in Europe. Recognising the need \nfor more flexibility, Thomasson defined a new term, \nthe soil water available to plants (SWAP) for the \ntotal amount of water that can be considered to be \nextractable by the roots of different crop plants. The \nbasic concepts of soil water availability and the cal- \n2.3. Assessment of agricultural drought risk culation of SWAP in a European context are \ndescribed in detail by Jones et al.

This can be \ncalculated from basic meteorological data and accu- \nmulated over the growing season of a crop to pro- \nvide an index of climatic dryness. \nThe average risk of drought in an area can then \nbe estimated using a simple \"capacity model\". The \naverage potential soil moisture deficit in mm \n(PSMD) can be adjusted for different crops (MD- \ncrop), also measured in mm, as described by \nThomasson [27]. The resulting crop adjusted MD \n(mm) is then subtracted from the SWAP value (mm) \ncalculated for the same crop according to the stan- \ndard rooting models described by Jones et al. [14]. \nIf the result is negative then the area is regarded as \ndroughty for the crop in question but if it is positive. \nthen the system is regarded as providing sufficient \nmoisture for sustaining crop growth. \nCurrently there is a serious lack of reliable mea- \nsurements of water retention properties, essential \nfor calculating SWAP for soils in Europe. However, \nit is likely that during the next few years, techniques \nto measure or derive data that quantify the com- \nplexity of soil water relations will improve. In the \nmeantime, simple pedotransfer rules [16, 311 and \nmathematically based pedotransfer functions [I ,  \n351 offer the only alternative for estimating the soil \ncomponent of drought risk. \nIn the UK and Denmark where there are accessi- \nble soil and climatic data sets, SWAP values are \ncombined with climatic data to provide estimates of \ndrought for policy making in the agricultural sector \n[12, 13, 29, 301. In these north Europeail countries, \ndrought is not currently perceived as being of great \nsignificance yet the basic data do exist to estimate \nthe risk. The next stage at European level will be to \ncalculate moisture deficits, preferably on a grid \nbasis, as has been done for UK [21], and produce \ndistribution maps of average droughtiness based on \nthe SWAP and average MD crop data. The meteo- \nrological data to make this possible are currently \nstored for the whole of Europe by the MARS \nProject at JRC [32]. \n3.2.

This database contains daily temperature, \nrainfall and evaporation for each grid square. \nThe data are derived from measurements, made \nat individual meteorological stations, which have \nbeen interpolated and subsequently corrected, for \noutput on the 50 km grid. These data are the best \ncilrrently available for the whole of Europe. \nHowever, weather and climate can change signifi- \ncantly over 50 km in many parts of the continent \nand it is clear that ultimately better data will be \nneeded at European level to provide accurate pre- \ndictions of the risk of agricultural drought. A \n\"MARS climatology\" on a 25 km x 25 km or 20 km \nx 20 km grid, using techniques similar to those used \nby Ragg et al. [21] and Hough and Jones [ I l l ,  \n- \nFor example, temperature data can be mapped \nmore precisely than at present by using a digital ter- \nrain model (DTM). A 1 km x 1 ltm DTM, current- \nly available at JRC, contains the altitude values that \ncould be used, together with the strong relationship \nbetween temperature and altitude, to interpolate \ntemperature parameters. Monthly mean tempera- \ntures, with standard deviation or quartile values, \ncalculated for the individual meteorological sta- \ntions, would probably be sufficient for producing \ninterpolated data sets. \nInterpolating rainfall data at finer resolution than \n50 km x 50 km with the aid of a DTM is much more \ndifficult than for temperature because the effect of \naltitude on rainfall amounts is complex. There is no \nphysical standard like the adiabatic lapse rate (6 \"C \nper 1000 m rise). For example, in sheltered situa- \ntions, rainfall can decrease with increasing altitude, \nwhereas in areas where the weather systems are \ndominantly cyclonic, with strong prevailing winds, \nP. Zdruli et al. \norographic effects cause rainfall to increase with \naltitude on the windward side of any high ground. \nConversely, the relationship between altitude and \ntemperature deviates only sligl~tly from the stan- \ndard rate. Despite these complications, improving \nthe spatial resolution of the MARS climatology \ndatabase, particularly for evaporation and rainfall, \nhas now become an urgent requirement. \n4. Conclusions \nIt has been shown that basic soil maps can be \nused to identify areas where broadly agricultural \ndrought is likely to be a problem. This approach \ncould be useful as a \"first filter\" for land evaluation, \ni.e. whether it is possible to grow a particular crop \nin a specific area or the degree of risk for a cropping \nsystem. However, more precise modelling of \ndroughtiness, based on soil-climate interactions, is \nneeded to support policy making today. The rele- \nvance of this type of modelling, applied through a \nsoil map at 1 : 1 000 000 scale, may be questioned. It \nis more appropriate at scales of 1 :50000 or larger, \nwhere real crop performance ill specific fields, or \nwhere detailed management interventions, are \nbeing evaluated. It is clear that the basic data to run \nsuch models at scales less than 1 : 1 000 000 will be \nlacking for some parts of Europe for many years to \ncome. In the absence of these data, however, the \napproach described in this paper offers the best \nchance of achieving results that are satisfactory \nenough for broad scale policy making in the imme- \ndiate future. \nAcknowledgements: The authors are grateful to a \nnumber of colleagues for their help in the preparation of \nthis paper: M.
