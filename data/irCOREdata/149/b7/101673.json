The research draws upon a bigger study, which inves-\ntigated a number of locations. This paper deals with one of these, with\nthe specific purpose of investigating whether the relationship between\nthe tourists and their perceptions is linked to their visitation patterns.\nIt argues that the understanding and management of heritage tourism\nas a social phenomenon should not be based solely on an arbitrary\nfactor: the presence of tourists. It is suggested that elements more sub-\nYaniv Poria is at the Department of Hotel and Tourism Management, Ben Gurion Univer-\nsity of the Negev and Dick Butler and David Airey are professors in the School of Manage-\nment at the University of Surrey (Guildford GU2 7XH, UK.

Airey\u2019s cover tourism education, policy,\nand development.\n238\n239PORIA, BUTLER AND AIREY\njective in nature and relating to the actual relationship between the\nspace and the individual lie at the core of this phenomenon. The\nresearch presented challenges the perception that all those who visit\na place come only to \u201cgaze\u201d, be educated or to enjoy themselves. For\nsome, it is argued this is an emotional experience, that people come\nto \u201cfeel\u201d rather than to \u201cgaze\u201d (Urry 1990).\nCLARIFYING THE CORE OF HERITAGE TOURISM\nHeritage, \u201cthe \u2018buzz\u2019 word of the 1990s\u201d (Palmer 1999:315), is\nregarded as one of the most significant and fastest growing compo-\nnents of tourism (Alzua, O\u2019Leary and Morrison 1998; Herbert 1995).\nIt is referred to as something which needs to be managed (Cheung\n1999) and marketed (Bennett 1995) differently. The subject is of\nincreasing interest from a range of disciplines and its study is perceived\nas useful for understanding social behavior of individuals and society\nas a whole (Hewison 1987; Nuryanti 1996). Research has focused on\nthe growing \u201cheritage industry\u201d (Conlin 2001; Hewison 1987) where\nresearchers often differentiate between cultural (Richards 1996), natu-\nral (Hall 2000), and built (Laws 1998) elements. This paper focuses\nupon what is generally called cultural heritage, but for convenience\nthe term heritage is used throughout.\nThe literature commonly investigates and clarifies elements associa-\nted with the supply of heritage and its management (Crang 1999; Hale-\nwood and Hannam 2001; Garrod and Fyall 2000). Less interest and\nattention has been paid to the demand component and even less to the\nrelationship between the two. Of the literature about demand, much is\nconcerned with motivation (Swarbrooke 1994) and market segments\n(Richards 1996). Few studies explore the relationship between these\nand the core of site attributes, which is believed to be essential for\nunderstanding heritage tourism as a social phenomenon. Clarification\nof this relationship could provide researchers with the theoretical back-\nground necessary for a more meaningful understanding.\nEarlier work in this field in Ghana (Bruner 1995), and at the Irish\nNational Heritage Park (Johnson 1999) refers to perceptions as a fac-\ntor relevant in understanding behavior. Cheung (1999) indicates that\na location (Ping Shan Heritage Trail) can have different meanings for\ndifferent people. Fawcett and Cormack (2000) suggest that, in the con-\ntext of the presentation of artifacts associated with literature (authors\nand\/or their stories), the actual perception of something as authentic\nmay be influenced by the understanding of what is \u201creal\u201d and \u201cauth-\nentic\u201d. Gruffudd, Herbert and Piccini (1999) believe that what is\npresented stimulates thought and notions based on the individual\u2019s\nbackground. Michael (2002) asserts that heritage tourism should not\nbe viewed in terms of arbitrary issues, but should take into consider-\nation sociopsychological needs. Another study of relevance here con-\ncerns residents\u2019 attitudes. Uriely, Israeli and Reichel (2002), taking into\naccount local people\u2019s religious affiliations, argue that the relationship\nbetween the local residents and the heritage presented can influence\nthe locals\u2019 attitudes towards development (in Nazareth, in the case of\n240 HERITAGE TOURISM\ntheir study). Geographic and psychological literature suggests that in\norder to understand individual behavior in a specific space, it is neces-\nsary to reveal certain aspects of the links between the individual and\nthat space (Zube 1987; Zube, Sell and Taylor 1982). Although all these\nstudies used perception, this concept was not explored in relation to\nthe specific issue under scrutiny here. Exactly what perception refers\nto remains open, and its relation to personal heritage was not investi-\ngated. Nevertheless, the literature suggests that some links are relevant\nto the understanding and this relationship is examined in this paper.\nIn fact the literature contains two main approaches to the precise\nphenomenon under study. The first and most common is to regard it\nas tourism in places categorized as heritage or historic places. An\nexample of this approach is illustrated in Seale\u2019s description \u201cthe visi-\ntors to heritage areas\/sites\u201d (1996:486) or Laws\u2019 arbitrary classification\nof those visiting castles as heritage tourists (1998). Another example is\nHalewood and Hannam, who consider museums that \u201cgive information\nabout the Viking period\u201d (2001:569) to be part of heritage tourism,\nbased purely on the fact that they present history. This approach sug-\ngests that the actual presence of tourists is sufficient. The second\napproach emphasizes that the contents of a place are linked to the\nphenomenon, as illustrated by Strauss and Lord. In their opening sen-\ntence, they indicate \u201chistory is a popular theme for recreational travel\u201d\nand they refer to activities in relation to the artifacts presented\n(2001:199). This approach emphasizes that the history featured is part\nof the experience and partially links it with motivations for the trip.\nHowever, neither of these two approaches focuses on the core of the\nissue explored in this paper as its research problem: the relationship\nbetween perceptions and behavior. In other words, is it possible to\ndistinguish a separate category of people by their behavior, and can\nthis be linked to their perceptions related to their own heritage?\nThe approach taken in this research is closely related to other grow-\ning areas of investigation, notably authenticity and the nature of reality\nand objectivity (Morris 1988). This is in line with the view of Crang\nthat subjects \u201ccan never experience the authentic but always end up\nfaced with markers of that experience rather than the experience\nitself\u201d (1996:416). It also accords with claims that there is no such con-\ncept as one history and any presentation of it in any context is to some\nextent subjective (Crang 1999; Sivan 1997). Following this thinking,\nthe paper seeks to identify heritage tourism as a phenomenon related\nto demand rather than to the artifacts presented. For this reason, no\nattempt is made to discuss the nature of the heritage presented nor\nwhether the relationships are real or objective. This of course is differ-\nent from other approaches as well as international conventions that\nidentify heritage from the point of view of supply. However, the\napproach taken here, which represents a shift in perspective, is\nimportant in helping to understand this phenomenon and identify\nother subgroups. If such relationships are found, it may be that other\nsubgroups would be better defined in terms of the interplay among a\nsite, its tourists, and their subjective perceptions (Poria, Butler and\nAirey 2001b).\n241PORIA, BUTLER AND AIREY\nStudy Methods\nTo address the research problem, it was necessary to unravel the\nrelationship between, on the one hand, the tourists and their percep-\ntions and, on the other, their behavior. Four components were exam-\nined as the explained variables: personal characteristics, the site attri-\nbutes, awareness, and perception. It is suggested that the relationship\namong these factors is crucial, especially when what is presented can\nbe linked to the individuals in a way that is intimate to their identity.\nThe statement of Swarbrooke that \u201cthe reality of a product or experi-\nence is probably less important .... than the consumer\u2019s perception of\nit\u201d (1996:A69) and the question of awareness were explored via a set\nof questions (Clements and Josiam 1995). In general, in order for\nsomething to be interpreted, and to be perceived as having meaning,\nan individual needs to be aware of it (Solomon, Bamossy and Aske-\ngaard 1999). With this in mind, it was necessary to clarify whether tour-\nists were aware of the site and its characteristics (Bockstein, Bennett\nand Uken 1991).\nThe outcome variable was the visitation patterns. To identify any\nlinks with the explanatory variables, it was decided to study behavior:\nbefore, during, and after the visit. Those before included motivations\nand previous visits. Concentration on motivations was due to the cru-\ncial importance of this variable in understanding behavior (Balogulu\nand Uysal 1996; Crompton 1979). During the visit, the research con-\ncentrated on actions (such as purchasing souvenirs and length of stay),\nand perceptions. Satisfaction was explored as it is associated with\nexpectations as well as the actual experience. Differences in the level\nof satisfaction may also be useful in distinguishing between different\ntypes of people. Behavior afterwards included the intentions to revisit\n(whether or not an entrance fee is charged), as well as willingness to\nrecommend to others. As the literature suggests, these two patterns of\nbehavior are associated with consumer perceptions and could provide\na basis for understanding (Kozak 1999; Murphy 2001).\nOne of the key attributes of the study location was that it should\npresent a diversity of respondents. In this context, Israel is a highly\nsuitable location in that it contains, in a relatively small area, many\nplaces that would seem to relate differently to different individuals\n(Akhtar 2000; Schiller 1992). The country covers most of the biblical\nHoly Land and some locations associated with Islam. Israel is also tied\nstrongly to Jewish communities and Zionism around the world\n(Giddens 1998). It was recognized from the beginning that the choice\nof Israel would result in investigating places associated with the Bible,\nas well as with the history of the state of Israel. While the study as a\nwhole explored a number of different locations (Poria 2001a), this\npaper presents the findings pertaining solely to the Wailing Wall.\nThe Wailing Wall is in fact a very small area. Its actual length, access-\nible to the public, is about 60 meters. The Wailing Wall (Ha-Kotel Ha-\nMa\u2019aravi in Hebrew, or the Western Wall) is the most important\nreligious location for Jews and also has historic significance as it is\nbelieved to be part of the original Temple. In addition, it is associated\n242 HERITAGE TOURISM\nwith Israel\u2019s victory in the Six-Day War (1967), which for Zionists sym-\nbolizes the existence of an independent Jewish state (Aner, Ben-Dov\nand Naor 1981). The Wailing Wall is also relevant to Christians on\nreligious grounds, as Jesus stood there and prophesized the downfall\nof the Temple and criticized the way it was run and how religion was\nbeing practiced (Schiller 1992). The space is highly appropriate for\nthe purposes of this research due to its other attributes: it is located\nin proximity to other attractions visited by different groups (the Holy\nSepulchre, Via Dolorosa, Yad Vashem); there is no other attraction\nadjacent to the Wall itself, which might have an influence; entrance is\nopen to all (unlike others with a religious orientation in Jerusalem\nsuch as Al-Haram al-Sharif); and there is no entrance fee. Due to this\ncombination of factors, the Wailing Wall is visited by a variety of tour-\nists who may approach its history in different ways. It is this variety that\nprovides a good basis for exploring the relationships that are at the\nheart of this study.\nThe research instrument was a structured questionnaire\nimplemented through face-to- face interviews at Ben-Gurion airport on\ndeparture from Israel. Eysenck (1998) argues that a vacation provides\nan episodic memory containing personal experiences associated with\na particular time and place, and thus on departure information can\nbe provided about the whole experience. Further, at this point memor-\nies were fresh; and since most people visiting Israel leave from Ben-\nGurion airport, this was a good location to conduct the survey (Israel\nMinistry of Tourism 1996).\nThe fieldwork needed a period when there would be a maximum\nmix of tourists in Israel, thus avoiding specific religious holidays and\na Papal visit which took place in 2000. The objective of the sampling\nstrategy chosen was not to achieve a representative sample, but to\ninclude a diversity that would be able to provide data relevant to the\nresearch investigation. This diversity among personal characteristics as\nwell as among perceptions is essential for the purpose of this research.\nThe actual population was departing international tourists who were\nable to speak and understand English and were above 15 years old\n(Apter, Hatab, Tyano and Weizinan (1998) consider cognitive abilities\nstable at this age). The reason for only sampling non-residents was the\ngreater diversity among them than among the local population. Every\nnth individual who was in the duty-free area was approached (the nth\nvalue was determined by factors such as the number of interviewers\nand the number of flights departing at a certain time period). Before\ninclusion in the sample, the interviewees were asked to confirm\nwhether or not they were on a tourist trip. Only those answering in\nthe affirmative were included. The interviews were conducted by five\nstudents selected on academic criteria and after interviews with one of\nthe authors. They were not told about the specific objectives of the\nresearch in order to reduce the likelihood that they might lead the\ninterviewees to certain answers.\nA pilot survey took place in December 1999 and the main data col-\nlection between mid-April and mid-May 2000. The interviews were car-\nried out at day and night times, both on weekdays and weekends. The\n243PORIA, BUTLER AND AIREY\nfindings presented in this study are based on descriptions of associ-\nation as well as differences among groups based on averages. The\nassociations reported are based on a significance level of 0.05. For dif-\nferences among more than two groups, a Scheffe test was used with a\nlevel of significance of 0.01, as this is stricter than the more commonly\nused Tucky test. As the use of parametric and non-parametric tests is\none of the \u201cunresolved issues in data analysis\u201d (Bryman and Cramer\n1996:117), it was decided to report only findings in which significant\nresults were found from both techniques. For convenience, the results\nare presented based on the use of parametric tests only.\nStudy Findings\nThe whole sample was composed of 398 participants (38.2% female\nand 61.8% male). The unequal ratio of male to female could be due\nto business tourists of whom more are normally men than women. In\nthis sample, 304 (92.7%) went to the Wailing Wall. Of these 30.8%\nwere Jewish, 62.6% Christian, and 8.6% of other religions. Participants\nwere asked for the strength of their religious belief based on a scale\nbetween 0 to 6 (0 representing \u201cI am not religious at all\u201d and 6 \u201cI\nconsider myself very religious\u201d). A One Way Anova test was conducted\nwhich illustrated significant differences. Scheffe tests indicated that the\ndifferences between Jews (3.28) and Christians (3.92) was found to be\nsignificant (P=0.046). The five most common places of residence (of 42\nlisted) were: the United States (33.6%), the United Kingdom (21.3%),\nFrance (7.8%), Germany (5.5%), and South Africa (3.5%). Almost half\n(48.7%) traveled with a family member, 36.5% with friends. Of those\nwith someone else, 8.2% were with one or two children under 12 years\nold. Among those who estimated their yearly income in US Dollars the\nmode was $25,001\u201350,000. Some 66.8% of the sample had undergrad-\nuate or graduate education. With respect to age, the mode was 20\u201329\nyears (26.1%) and the median 40\u201349 years.\nThe main factor in explaining differences in visitation patterns to\nthe Wailing Wall was found to be perceptions of the site in relation\nto personal heritage, and this is the main finding presented in this\npaper. The differences in the perceptions (in comparison to other\nexplanatory variables explored) lead to clear distinctions in each of\nthe subgroups and to an understanding of behavior.\nBefore proceeding to consider the differences, it is useful to outline\nthe actual perceptions expressed by respondents on a seven-point\nscale. The key finding from this is that most of the responses were\nconcentrated at the two ends of the scale: the site is absolutely not\nperceived as part of the individual\u2019s heritage (26.3%) or is absolutely\nso perceived (28%). This bipolar finding was also supported in the\nanswers to five further questions.\nTurning to the visitation patterns, these were analyzed against the\nperception of the Wailing Wall. Clear differences and relationships\nwere found in the periods before, during, and after the visit. In connec-\ntion with the period before, the respondents were asked to comment\non statements dealing with their motivations. These statements were\n244 HERITAGE TOURISM\nbased on motivating factors, such as desire for emotional involvement,\neducation, enjoyment, and relaxation. Clear patterns were found in\nthe levels of perceptions. For example, those who visited because they\nwanted to be emotionally involved were very likely to perceive the place\nas part of their own heritage. Less clear associations were found with\na second group of motivations relating to the history presented (for\nexample, \u201cyou visited because you wanted to learn\u201d). No associations\nwere found with reasons not linked to the history or heritage (for\nexample, \u201cyou visited because there was no admission fee\u201d). Another\naspect that was subject to investigation was level of intention to revisit.\nThe results indicate that those who considered the place as \u201cabsolutely\npart of their heritage\u201d were significantly different from all other groups\nin that they were more likely to revisit. In other words, frequency is\nonly related to the strongest perception of the site as a part of the\ntourists\u2019 heritage. A likely explanation for this is that this group will\nbe interested in visiting more than once because of the emotional\nexperience involved.\nQuestions were also asked about behavior during the visit. A pattern\nwas found in relation to length of stay. Those who saw the Wailing\nWall as part of their heritage were likely to stay longer than those who\ndid not. An explanation may be different behaviors (such as wanting\nto write a note or to pray) which will lead to more time being spent\nthere. Another difference is linked to the interpretation methods used.\nNo formal interpretive guidance is on offer and participants were\nasked if they used any other methods (personal guide, guidebooks,\netc.). Among those who viewed the Wailing Wall as part of their own\nheritage, only 31.8% used interpretation methods. The figure for those\nwho absolutely did not do so was 62.5%. This may be because the\nformer are more aware of the history, or they may feel less need to\nlearn (particularly if they had visited in the past). Differences were\nfound also in levels of satisfaction. In these there was a positive associ-\nation (Pearson correlation=0.361, P=0.000). In other words, those who\nsaw the place as part of their own heritage gained more satisfaction\nthan others. The strength of this association is remarkable given the\nlow spread of responses found in consumer satisfaction research in\ngeneral (Peterson and Wilson 1992). The average level of satisfaction\nwas 5 (on a scale where 0 indicates \u201ctotally unsatisfied\u201d and 6 indicates\n\u201ctotally satisfied\u201d). The group that did not consider the Wailing Wall\nas part of their own background estimated their level of satisfaction as\n4.6, while those who did, estimated it as 5.64.\nFour questions were asked about perception of the visit, using a 0\nto 6 scale (0 representing \u201cI completely disagree\u201d and 6 \u201cI completely\nagree\u201d). These were analyzed against the respondents\u2019 perceptions of\nthe place, also on a seven-point scale (0 representing \u201cthis is absolutely\nnot part of my own heritage\u201d and 6 \u201cthis is absolutely part of my own\nheritage\u201d). The mean scores for the significant differences are based\non a Scheffe test (Table 1). These are presented in groups according\nto the perception of the site.\nIt is notable that diverse views about the Wailing Wall did not lead\nto differences in the extent to which the experience was thought to\n245PORIA, BUTLER AND AIREY\ncontribute to education. In the context of the other three questions,\nthe views did lead to significant differences. It is clear, for example,\nthat those with a close connection were emotionally moved to a far\ngreater extent than those for whom this was absolutely not the case\n(5.070 versus 2.725). The coherency in the answers to the last three\nquestions presented in the table can be explained by the fact each\nreflects the relationship between the individual and the heritage\npresented. Another interesting pattern is that those who saw the place\nas \u201cabsolutely part of my heritage\u201d were in nearly all cases significantly\ndistinct from others. The number of differences presented, especially\nin the context of the third statement, suggests that there is an associ-\nation between such a view and the perception of the visit. The linear\nassociations suggest both modest and relatively high positive relation-\nships (Table 2). It appears that the more the tourists consider the Wail-\ning Wall as part of their heritage, the more they regard it as an\nemotional experience.

The first two dealt with intentions to revisit and to do so if\nthere was an entrance fee. The other two questions were concerned\nwith intentions to recommend to friends, both with and without an\nentrance fee. Significant differences were found in all the questions,\nbut those with strong perceptions that it is absolutely part of their heri-\ntage were more likely to revisit (Table 3). In the context of the first\nand the second questions, there were more significant differences than\nwith the third and fourth questions. This is likely to reflect the fact\nthat respondents have a greater level of certainty when referring to\nthemselves than when speaking for their friends (third and fourth\nquestions). This assumption is based on comments provided in the\ncontext of this question by the interviewees. Participants mentioned\nthat perception and personal characteristics of their friends would be\nsomething which would influence the answers given.\nAdditional analyses were examined to identify further relationships\nbetween the concepts explored, revealing patterns between such\nelements as religious affiliation and strength of religious belief. How-\never, these were weaker than the perceptions in relation to personal\nheritage and, as such, are not reported here. From a theoretical per-\nspective, it is argued that the association found between visitation pat-\nterns and personal characteristics is due to perceptions of the site in\nrelation to respondents\u2019 own heritage and not the other way round.\nFor example, particular tourists do not behave in the way they do\nbecause they belong to a certain religion but because of their views\nabout the site. In this study, although personal characteristics are asso-\nciated with such patterns, they are not the reason for them. It is sug-\ngested that in places where religion is not central, the actual percep-\ntion could be associated with other personal characteristics, but a real\nunderstanding of the visitation patterns is rooted in the link between\nindividuals and their heritage. This information has practical impli-\ncations, as the tourists can be segmented based on their perceptions\nand can be identified relatively easily based on their personal charac-\nTable 2.

This may be useful for issues linked to the operational man-\nagement as well as the marketing of places.\nCONCLUSION\nThe results of this study indicate clearly that motivations, (potential)\nbehavior, and perceptions are all linked to perceptions of the site.\nThese relationships are at the core of this research. It is suggested that\nthose who perceive a site as a part of their personal heritage are the\nbasis of the phenomenon called heritage tourism, and they are dis-\ntinguished from others by their behavior. It follows that \u201cheritage tour-\nism\u201d as explored here should not include those who are visiting a place\n\u201cjust because it is there\u201d, nor those who are primarily motivated by a\nwish to learn. Based on this study such tourism is not simply being in\nspaces which are declared by \u201cexperts\u201d or other stakeholders to be\n\u201cheritage sites\u201d. Instead, it is suggested that a definition of this type of\ntourism can be: \u201ca subgroup, in which the main motivation for visiting\nTable 3.

The differences\nbetween the two definitions are presented in Figure 1. The existing\napproach includes all who visit (Group I, II, III, IV). The approach in\nthis research is to include only those in group IV. Although this\nreduces the scale, it leads to a better understanding (Poria, Butler and\nAirey 2001a), by helping researchers to differentiate between this and\nother groups. It also minimizes the line of thought that heritage tour-\nism \u201ccan be rather a heterogeneous phenomenon\u201d (Balcar and Pearce\n1996:211) and prevents the rather haphazard classification of things\nand elements as \u201cheritage\u201d because people are not quite sure exactly\nwhat this title covers (Glen 1991).\nAt this stage it is important to emphasize that, although this study\nidentified differences among those visiting, it is not argued that any of\nthe groups have or do not have their own valid needs and expectations.\nFurther, no attempt is made to suggest that an attraction can be a\n\u201csatisfying tourism experience only to tourists who consider it to be\nFigure 1. Segmentation of Tourists Visiting a Heritage Site\n249PORIA, BUTLER AND AIREY\npart of their own heritage\u201d (Garrod and Fyall 2001:1051). Nevertheless,\nit is argued that such groups may be different in various ways, and\nthose who manage sites could usefully be aware that there are differ-\nences between heritage tourists and tourists at heritage places. It is\nimportant to understand that environments in which heritage is\npresented are places which \u201cfunction not only to draw tourists\u2026from\nthose wishing to experience the past, but also to provide a setting for\nentertainment, relaxation, or shopping\u201d (Waitt 2000:836). For some,\nsuch an attraction is actually a space to which they relate on a personal\nlevel and this differentiates them from others who come to \u201cgaze\u201d.\nThis study supports the literature which suggests that understanding\nbehavior must include understanding the relationship between individ-\nuals and the artifact or space (Boniface and Fowler 1993; Timothy\n1997). The principal conclusion of the research is that heritage tour-\nism stems from the relationship between the supply and the demand.\nIt is not so much the attributes themselves, but the perceptions of them\nwhich is critical.\nAs in all research, this study has a number of limitations. Prominent\namong these is the limited number of locations used. An attempt to\ndeal with this was made by ensuring a diversity of tourists, but it is\nrecognized that a future study could improve this by including a\ngreater diversity of sites. Other potential limitations are associated with\nthe actual location of the survey. The fieldwork in this case was carried\nout in a place strongly associated with the Holy Books and the Jewish\nfaith. As a result, this study was related to religion. It can be argued\nthat this limitation could apply in many other circumstances. For\nexample, if the sites investigated were in England, the heritage\nexplored would most likely be related to a particular type of tourist\nand associated with a sense of Englishness. One way to overcome this\nlimitation would be to select a wider range from more than one coun-\ntry.\nIn order to confirm the main findings and to provide a better basis\nfor generalization, it would have been useful to test this approach in\ndifferent kinds of locations. Examples could be \u201cglobal must see\u201d\nattractions that present historic features (such as the Acropolis, the\nPyramids, and the Great Wall of China). Some perceive them as part\nof their heritage, some as historic sites with a high level of awareness\nof their history, while others may have a low level of awareness of their\nhistoric attributes. Findings from such research could sharpen the\nunderstanding of the relationship presented here.\nThe study supports the idea that visitation patterns have to do with\nparticipants\u2019 personal characteristics, their views, and the meanings\nthey attach to different spaces. This suggests that a reflection about\nthe tourists\u2019 characteristics could be made in reverse. Research could\nbe conducted on the level of the individual and the level of societies,\nand could involve, for example, identifying groups and changes over\ntime by investigating behavior patterns. A possible area to conduct such\nresearch could be a former conflict zone. For example, one could\nexamine whether Turks who go to Turkish-Greek conflict areas (such\n250 HERITAGE TOURISM\nas Cyprus) have different attitudes towards this history from those who\ndo not do so.\nMore research is also in order about the perceptions of the experi-\nence (Poria, Butler and Airey 2002). This research found that some\npeople who perceived a site as part of their own background were\nmotivated by a feeling of obligation. It may be useful to explore\nwhether or not they identify themselves as tourists despite this sense\nof obligation. In such a situation, the question is whether they view\nthis as a tourist experience. This may clarify whether they are partici-\npating in a social obligation rather than a leisure experience.\nThe research contributes to the tourism literature by suggesting that\nsome subgroups could be reconsidered and challenged based on the\nrelationships between perceptions and behavior (Poria et al 2001b).\nThis suggests that other named subgroups may not exist as unique and\nseparate. For example, is there a real substantial difference between\nmountain tourism (East 1996), rural tourism (Kastenholz, Duane and\nGordon 1999), or farm tourism (Clarke 1999)? This study argues that\nthere should be a strong theoretical background for establishing sub-\ngroups, rather than just the presence of people in certain spaces,\ninvolvement in a certain activity, or common sociodemographic\ncharacteristics (Poria et al 2001b). Such classifications may be useful\nfor marketing purposes; but, at the same time, they may lead to con-\nfusion in the theoretical understanding by highlighting relationships\nthat may not be at the core of the behavior. Investigating and\nattempting to clarify such subgroups would lead to a better under-\nstanding. This also supports the line of thought that the clarification\nof their experience should be \u201c \u2018grounded\u2019 in the realities that tourists\nthemselves describe\u201d (Prentice, Witt and Hamer 1996:2).\nThe exploration as presented here can be helpful for the manage-\nment of places. As suggested, these have different meanings for differ-\nent people. Understanding the tourists\u2019 profiles in relation to what is\npresented should lead to better management (Poria et al 2001a). The\nrecognition and the identification of these differences can lead to man-\nagers making changes to the marketing process, the pricing system,\nand the interpretation provided (Poria 2001b, 2001c). Marketing\nresearch (Kotler, Bowen and Mak 1999; Teo and Yeoh 1997) suggests\nthat these differences should have implications for the marketing pro-\ncess in general and for advertising in particular. As suggested in the\npresent study, differences in perceptions in relation to personal heri-\ntage were linked to motivation. Hence those responsible for such\nplaces need to be aware of two markets: those who come to see historic\nartifacts to be educated or for enjoyment (well-known motivations for\nvisiting, Crang 1996), and those who come to be emotionally involved\nin an experience. This information could have implications in advertis-\ning, especially if the relationship between tourists and that which is\nwanted is associated with personal characteristics. For example, bro-\nchures are commonly available in different languages, but the context\nis the same in each translation. In certain attractions, there may be\na place for providing different interpretations linked to perceptions\nand expectations.\n251PORIA, BUTLER AND AIREY\nIn summary, this research contributes in three important ways to the\nbody of theory. First, it suggests a new working definition for possible\nuse by other researchers, emphasizing the relationships between per-\nception of a site and its heritage attributes. Second, it argues that there\nare differences between tourists based upon their perceptions and that\nthese lead to differences in behavior. Third, the research identifies the\nobligatory nature of some tourism. This makes a contribution to the\ntheoretical background in that it provides a distinction between the\nindividual\u2019s view of their experience as a recreation\/non-recreation\nactivity conducted in a leisure\/non-leisure time frame. This may prove\nto be helpful to the development of theory and relationships with disci-\nplines such as leisure, recreation, geography, and psychology.\u0001A\nREFERENCES\nAkhtar, S.\n2000 Christians, Muslims, Jews Living in Disharmony.
