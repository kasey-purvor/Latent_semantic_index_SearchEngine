Introduction\nFollowing the fabrication of monolayer graphene [1], the\nobservation of an unusual sequencing of quantum Hall ef-\nfect plateaus [2] was explained in terms of Dirac-like chiral\nquasiparticles with Berry phase \u03c0 [3\u20136]. Subsequently, bi-\nlayer graphene became a subject of intense interest in its\nown right. This followed the realization that the low energy\nHamiltonian of a bilayer describes chiral quasiparticles with\na parabolic dispersion and Berry phase 2\u03c0 [7] as confirmed\nby quantum Hall effect [8] and ARPES measurements [9].\nThe electronic band structure of bilayer graphene has\nbeen modelled using both density functional theory [10\u201312]\nand the tight-binding model [13,7,14\u201317]. It has been pre-\ndicted [7] that asymmetry between the on-site energies in\nthe layers leads to a tunable gap between the conduction\nand valence bands. The dependence of the gap on external\ngate voltage has been modelled taking into account screen-\ning within the tight binding model [16,17,12] and such cal-\nculations appear to be in good agreement with ARPES\nmeasurements [9], observations made in the regime of the\nquantum Hall effect [17], and density functional theory cal-\nculations [12].\nThe tight-binding model of bilayer graphene is reviewed\nin Section 2, including trigonal warping effects. Section 3\nexplains how the optical absorption coefficient of bilayer\ngraphene is influenced by the presence and dispersion of\npairs of electronic bands [18,19], in contrast to the fea-\ntureless absorption coefficient of monolayer graphene. We\nobtain the effective low energy Hamiltonian of bilayer\ngraphene in Section 4 and we show that it is dominated\nby chiral quasiparticles with a parabolic dispersion and\nBerry phase 2\u03c0. Section 5 describes the opening of a gap\nin bilayer graphene due to layer asymmetry with a demon-\nstration that an undoped, gapless bilayer is stable with\nrespect to the opening of a gap, followed by a calculation\nusing a self-consistent Hartree approximation to describe\nthe control of the gap in the presence of an external gate.\n2. The tight-binding model of bilayer graphene\nWe consider bilayer graphene to consist of two cou-\npled hexagonal lattices with inequivalent sites A1, B1 and\nA2, B2 on the bottom and top graphene sheets, respec-\ntively, arranged according to Bernal (A2-B1) stacking:\nas shown in Fig. 1(a), every B1 site in the bottom layer\nlies directly below an A2 site in the upper layer, but sites\nA1 and B2 do not lie directly below or above a site in\nthe other layer. We employ the tight-binding model of\ngraphite [20] by adapting the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure\nparameterization [21,22] of relevant couplings in order to\nmodel bilayer graphene. In-plane hopping is parameter-\nized by coupling \u03b3A1B1 = \u03b3A2B2 \u2261 \u03b30 and it leads to the\nin-plane velocity v = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b30\/h\u00af where a is the lattice\nconstant. In addition, we take into account the strongest\ninter-layer coupling, \u03b3A2B1 \u2261 \u03b31, between pairs of A2-B1\norbitals that lie directly below and above each other. Such\nstrong coupling produces dimers from these pairs of A2-\nB1 orbitals, leading to the formation of high energy bands\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier 2 March 2007\nA 1\nB 2\nB 1\nv\nv\nA 2\nB 1\ng 1\nA 2\nA 1\nB 2\n( a )\ne\n( 2 )\ne\n( 1 )\ne\n( 1 )\ne\n( 2 )\ng 1\n1\n2\nv p \/ g 1\ne \/ g 1\n21- 1- 2\n- 1\n- 2\n+\n+\n-\n-\n( b )\nFig. 1.

The Hamil-\ntonian takes into account asymmetry \u2206 = \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb1 between\non-site energies in the two layers, \u01eb2 =\n1\n2\u2206, \u01eb1 = \u2212 12\u2206.\nAt zero magnetic field, the Hamiltonian H has four\nvalley-degenerate bands [7], \u01eb\n(\u03b1)\n\u00b1 (p), \u03b1 = 1, 2, with\n\u01eb\n(\u03b1)2\n\u00b1 =\n\u03b321\n2\n+\n\u22062\n4\n+\n(\nv2 +\nv23\n2\n)\np2 + (\u22121)\u03b1\n\u221a\n\u0393\n\u0393= 14\n(\n\u03b321 \u2212 v23p2\n)2\n+ v2p2\n[\n\u03b321 +\u2206\n2 + v23p\n2\n]\n+2\u03be\u03b31v3v\n2p3 cos 3\u03c6. (2)\nThey are plotted in Fig. 1(b) for \u2206 = 0 and v3\/v = 0.1. The\ndispersion \u01eb\n(2)\n\u00b1 describes two bands with energies \u01eb\n(2)\n+ \u2265 \u03b31\nand \u01eb\n(2)\n\u2212 \u2264 \u03b31: they do not touch at the K point.

In the intermediate energy range, 14\u03b31(v3\/v)\n2, |\u2206| <\n|\u01eb1| < \u03b31, it can be approximated [7] with\n\u01eb\n(1)\n\u00b1 \u2248 \u00b1 12\u03b31\n[\u221a\n1 + 4v2p2\/\u03b321 \u2212 1\n]\n.

Optical absorption of bilayer graphene\nThe electromagnetic field absorption in graphene has\nbeen studied in a number of publications [24,18,19,25,26].\nWe show that the bilayer absorption coefficient can be de-\nscribed as\ng2 = (2\u03c0e\n2\/h\u00afc) f2(\u03c9), (4)\nand it is qualitatively different from the featureless mono-\nlayer absorption coefficient g1 = \u03c0e\n2\/h\u00afc, since g2 reflects\nthe presence and dispersion of two pairs of bands in bilayer\ngraphene [18,19] as described in Section 2 and Fig. 1(b).\nWe characterize the polarization of the EM field E\u03c9 =\n\u2113Ee\u2212i\u03c9t by denoting the vector \u2113\u2295 = (lx \u2212 ily)\/\n\u221a\n2 to cor-\nrespond to right-hand circular polarization and the vector\n\u2113\u2296 = (lx + ily)\/\n\u221a\n2 to be the left-handed circularly polar-\nized light.

The frequency dependence [27] of the bilayer optical\nabsorption is illustrated in Fig.2 in comparison to that in\na monolayer. It is the electron-hole excitation between the\nlow energy band \u01eb\n(1)\n\u00b1 and the split band \u01eb\n(2)\n\u00b1 which provides\nthe structure in the vicinity of h\u00af\u03c9 = \u03b31 (\u03b31 \u2248 0.4eV [22]).\nAt high photon energies, h\u00af\u03c9 \u226b \u03b31, the frequency depen-\ndence saturates at f = 1. The absorption coefficient for the\nleft- and right-handed light are the same over the whole\nspectral interval, so Eq. (5) is also applicable to light lin-\nearly polarised in the graphene plane.\n4. Effective low energy Hamiltonian\nTo describe the transport properties of bilayer graphene,\nit is convenient to use a low energy Hamiltonian that de-\nscribes effective hopping between the non-dimer sites, A1-\nB2, i.e. those that do not lie directly below or above each\nother and are not strongly coupled by \u03b31. This two com-\nponent Hamiltonian was derived in [7] using Green\u2019s func-\ntions. Alternatively (and equivalently), one can view the\neigenvalue equation of the four component Hamiltonian\nEq. (1) as producing four simultaneous equations for com-\nponents \u03c8A1, \u03c8B2, \u03c8A2, \u03c8B1. Eliminating the dimer state\ncomponents \u03c8A2, \u03c8B1 by substitution, and treating \u03b31 as\na large energy, gives the two component Hamiltonian [7]\ndescribing effective hopping between the A1-B2 sites:\nH\u02c62 =\u2212 1\n2m\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 0 (\u03c0\u2020)2\n\u03c02 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f8+ h\u02c6w + h\u02c6a; (6)\nh\u02c6w = \u03bev3\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 0 \u03c0\n\u03c0\u2020 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 , where \u03c0 = px + ipy;\nh\u02c6a =\u2212\u03be\u2206\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 1\n2\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 1 0\n0 \u22121\n\uf8f6\uf8f8\u2212 v2\n\u03b321\n\uf8eb\uf8ed \u03c0\u2020\u03c0 0\n0 \u2212\u03c0\u03c0\u2020\n\uf8f6\uf8f8\uf8f9\uf8fb .\nThe effective Hamiltonian H\u02c62 is applicable within the en-\nergy range |\u01eb| < 14\u03b31. In the valleyK, \u03be = +1, we determine\n\u03a8\u03be=+1 = (\u03c8A1, \u03c8B2), whereas in the valley K\u02dc, \u03be = \u22121, the\norder of components is reversed, \u03a8\u03be=\u22121 = (\u03c8B2, \u03c8A1). The\nHamiltonian H\u02c62 describes two possible ways of A1 \u21c0\u21bd B2\nhopping. The first term takes into account A1 \u21c0\u21bd B2 hop-\nping via the A2B1 dimer state. Consider A1 to B2 hopping\nas illustrated with the thick solid line in Fig. 1(a). It in-\ncludes three hops between sites: an intralayer hop from A1\nto B1, followed by an interlayer transition via the dimer\nstate B1A2, followed by an intralayer hop from A2 to B2.\nSince the two intralayer hops are both A to B, the first\nterm in the Hamiltonian contains \u03c02 or (\u03c0\u2020)2 on the off-\ndiagonal with the massm = \u03b31\/2v\n2 reflecting the energetic\ncost \u03b31 of a transition via the dimer state. This term in H\u02c62\nyields a parabolic spectrum \u01eb = \u00b1p2\/2m withm = \u03b31\/2v2.\nIt has been noticed [7] that quasiparticles described by it\nare chiral: their plane wave states are eigenstates of an op-\nerator \u03c3n2 with \u03c3n2 = 1 for electrons in the conduction\nband and \u03c3n2 = \u22121 for the valence band, where n2(p) =\n(cos(2\u03c6), sin(2\u03c6)) for p = (p cos\u03c6, p sin\u03c6). Quasiparticles\ndescribed by this term acquire a Berry phase 2\u03c0 upon an\nadiabatic propagation along a closed orbit, thus charge car-\nriers in a bilayer are Berry phase 2\u03c0 quasiparticles, in con-\ntrast to Berry phase \u03c0 particles in a monolayer [5].\nThe second term h\u02c6w in the Hamiltonian Eq. (6) de-\nscribes weak direct A1B2 coupling, \u03b3A1B2 \u2261 \u03b33 \u226a \u03b31. This\ncoupling \u03b3A1B2 \u2261 \u03b33 leads to the effective velocity v3 =\n(\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b33\/h\u00af where v3 \u226a v, Eq. (2). In a similar way to\nbulk graphite [21,28], the effect of coupling \u03b33 is to pro-\nduce trigonal warping, which deforms the isoenergetic lines\nalong the directions \u03c6 = \u03c60, as shown in Fig. 3(a). For\nthe valley K, \u03c60 = 0,\n2\n3\u03c0 and\n4\n3\u03c0, whereas for K\u02dc, \u03c60 = \u03c0,\n1\n3\u03c0 and\n5\n3\u03c0. The effective low energy Hamiltonian Eq. (6)\nyields the following energy for \u2206 = 0,\n\u01eb\n(1)2\n\u00b1 \u2248 (v3p)2 \u2212\n\u03bev3p\n3\nm\ncos (3\u03c6) +\n(\np2\n2m\n)2\n, (7)\nwhich agrees with Eq. (2) in the low energy limit |\u01eb| \u226a \u03b31.\nAt very low energies |\u01eb| < \u01ebL = 14\u03b31(v3\/v)2 \u2248 1meV, the\neffect of trigonal warping is dramatic. It leads to a Lifshitz\ntransition: the isoenergetic line is broken into four pockets,\nwhich can be referred to as one \u201ccentral\u201d and three \u201cleg\u201d\nparts [28,7]. The central part and leg parts have minimum\n|\u01eb| = 12 |\u2206| at p = 0 and at |p| = \u03b31v3\/v2, angle \u03c60, re-\nspectively. For v3 \u226a v, we find [7,22] that the separation\nof the 2D Fermi line into four pockets would take place\nfor very small carrier densities n < nL \u223c (v3\/v)2 n\u2217 \u223c\n1 \u00d7 1011cm\u22122.

They are\nobtained by taking into account intralayer hopping with velocity\nv, B1A2 interlayer coupling \u03b31, A1B2 interlayer coupling \u03b33 [with\nv3\/v = 0.1] and zero layer asymmetry \u2206. Dashed lines show the\nbands obtained by neglecting \u03b33 [i.e. with v3\/v = 0].\nproportionality is of order 1 as determined by the strongly\nwarped shape of the Fermi line at the Lifshitz transition.\nFor n < nL, the central part of the Fermi surface is ap-\nproximately circular with area Ac \u2248 \u03c0\u01eb2\/(h\u00afv3)2, and each\nleg part is elliptical with area A\u2113 \u2248 13Ac. The low energy\npart of the band structure is plotted in Fig. 3(b) along the\nline py = 0. Taking the line py = 0, \u03c6 = 0, at the first val-\nley \u03be = 1 gives \u01eb\n(1)\n\u00b1 \u2248 \u00b1|v3p \u2212 p2\/(2m)|.

We estimate the charging energy by\napproximating the excess electronic densities on the indi-\nvidual layers, n1 and n2, as uniformly distributed within\ninfinitesimally thin 2d layers. Then, the charging energy is\nEc = Q\n2\/2Cb where Q = en1L\n2 = \u2212en2L2 is the excess\ncharge on one of the layers in the presence of finite asym-\nmetry \u2206 = \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb1, and Cb = \u03b5r\u03b50L2\/c0 is the capacitance\nof a bilayer with interlayer separation c0 and area L\n2. For\nan undoped system, with Fermi energy \u01ebF = 0 and zero\nexcess total density n1 = \u2212n2, we only need to consider\nthe valence bands \u01eb\n(1)\n\u2212 and \u01eb\n(2)\n\u2212 . On integrating Eq. (9) from\nzero momentum to a large momentum p\u221e, and using an\nexpansion in \u2206\/\u03b31, we find that the change in the density\nof the valence bands for finite \u2206, as compared to \u2206 = 0, is\n4\nn1(2) \u2248 \u00b1\n\u03b31\u2206\n4\u03c0h\u00af2v2\nln\n(\n4\u03b31\n|\u2206|\n)\n, (10)\nand\nEc \u2248 e\n2\n32\u03c02Cb\n(\nL2\u03b321\nh\u00af2v2\n)(\nL2\u22062\nh\u00af2v2\n)\nln2\n(\n4\u03b31\n|\u2206|\n)\n. (11)\nThe change of the total single-particle energy may be\nestimated by integrating the valence bands energies, \u01eb\n(1)\n\u2212\nand \u01eb\n(2)\n\u2212 , with respect to momentum over the circularly\nsymmetric Fermi surface:\nE \u2248 2L\n2\n\u03c0h\u00af2\n\u222b\np dp\n[\n\u01eb\n(1)\n\u2212 (\u2206) + \u01eb\n(2)\n\u2212 (\u2206)\u2212 \u01eb(1)\u2212 (0)\u2212 \u01eb(2)\u2212 (0)\n]\n.\nOn integrating from zero momentum to a large momentum\np\u221e, and expanding in \u2206\/\u03b31, the change in the single par-\nticle energy for finite \u2206, as compared to \u2206 = 0, is\nE \u2248 \u2212 \u03b31\n8\u03c0\n(\nL2\u22062\nh\u00af2v2\n)[\n1\n2\n+ ln\n(\n4\u03b31\n|\u2206|\n)]\n. (12)\nThe logarithmic dependence of the density Eq. (10) ap-\npears as the square of the infrared logarithm in the charging\nenergy Eq. (11). Since the single particle energy Eq. (12)\ncontains only a single infrared logarithm, the large ener-\ngetic cost of charging an undoped bilayer ensures stability\nwith respect to the opening of a gap in the absence of an\napplied external electric field.\nThe gap \u2206 between the conduction and valence bands\narises from layer asymmetry so that, in contrast to mono-\nlayer graphene, there is a possibility of tuning the magni-\ntude of the gap using external gates. Indeed, a gate is rou-\ntinely used in experiments to control the density of elec-\ntrons n on the bilayer system [1,2,8] and, in general, this will\nproduce a simultaneous change in \u2206. In the following we\nuse a self-consistent Hartree approximation to determine\nthe electronic distribution on the bilayer and the resulting\nband structure in the presence of an external gate.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, we consider the graphene bilayer,\nwith interlayer separation c0, to be located a distance d\nfrom a parallel metallic gate. The application of an exter-\nnal gate voltage Vg = end\/\u03b5\n\u2032\nr\u03b50 induces a total excess elec-\ntronic density n = n1 + n2 on the bilayer system where n1\n(n2) is the excess density on the layer closest to (furthest\nfrom) the gate (we use SI units). Here \u03b50 is the permittivity\nof free space, \u03b5\u2032r is the dielectric constant of the material\nbetween the gate and the bilayer, and e is the electronic\ncharge.We assume that the screening of the effective charge\ndensity \u03c1+ = en from the metallic gate is not perfect, lead-\ning to an excess electronic density n2 on the layer furthest\nfrom the gate. Considering a Gaussian surface, such as that\nshown with the dashed lines in Fig. 5, shows that the ex-\ncess density n2 gives rise to an electric field with magnitude\nE = en2\/\u03b5r\u03b50 between the layers where \u03b5r is the nominal\ndielectric constant of the bilayer. There is a corresponding\nchange in potential energy \u2206U = e2n2c0\/\u03b5r\u03b50 that deter-\nmines the layer asymmetry [16]:\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\ns\n1\n =  - n 1 es  =  n e\nE '  =   n e\ne 0 e ' r\nE  =   n 2 e\ne 0 e r\ngate\ns\n2\n =  - n 2 e\nc 0d\nFig. 5. Schematic of the graphene bilayer, with interlayer separation\nc0, located a distance d from a parallel metallic gate. The gate\nvoltage Vg induces a total excess electronic density n = n1 + n2 on\nthe bilayer system where n1 (n2) is the excess density on the layer\nclosest to (furthest from) the gate. The dashed line shows a Gaussian\nsurface, from which it can be deduced that the magnitude of the\nelectric field between the layers of the bilayer is E = en2\/\u03b5r\u03b50.\n\u2206(n) = \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb1 \u2261 e\n2n2c0\n\u03b5r\u03b50\n. (13)\nIn terms of the capacitance of a bilayer of area L2, Cb =\n\u03b5r\u03b50L\n2\/c0, this may be written \u2206 (n) = e\n2n2L\n2\/Cb.\nWe self consistently calculate the excess densities n1, n2,\nn = n1+n2, Eq. (9), and the gap \u2206, Eq. (13). This has been\ndone numerically in Ref. [16]. Analytically, for moderately\nlow density, 4\u03c0h\u00af2v2|n| < \u03b321 , we find\n\u2206\u2248 e\n2L2n\n2Cb\nf\u039b\n(\nh\u00af2v2\u03c0|n|\n\u03b321\n)\n, (14)\nf\u039b (x)\u2248 1\n1 + \u039b\n(\nx\u2212 12 lnx\n) .\nThe function f\u039b(x) is plotted in Fig. 4(b) for different values\nof the dimensionless parameter \u039b = e2L2\u03b31\/(2\u03c0h\u00af\n2v2Cb)\nwhich describes the effectiveness of the interlayer screening\nof the bilayer. The limit \u039b \u2192 0 describes poor screening\nwhen the density on each layer is equal to n\/2 whereas for\n\u039b \u2192 \u221e there is excellent screening, the density lies solely\non the layer closest to the external gate and \u2206 = 0. Note\nthat f\u039b(x) \u2192 0 as x \u2192 0 because of the logarithm, mean-\ning that the effectiveness of interlayer screening increases\nupon lowering density. Using typical experimental param-\neters [22] we find \u039b \u2248 1.3. We estimate that the addition\nof density n \u223c 1012cm\u22122 yields a gap \u2206 \u223c 10meV [30].\n6. Conclusions\nWe reviewed the results of tight-binding model studies of\nbilayer graphene and its low-energy electronic band struc-\nture. The optical absorption coefficient of a bilayer displays\nfeatures related to the band structure on the energy scale\nof the order of the interlayer coupling \u03b31 \u2248 0.4eV [18,19], in\ncontrast to the featureless absorption coefficient of mono-\nlayer graphene. At much lower energies, \u01ebL \u223c 1meV, trigo-\n5\nnal warping of the band structure might produce a Lifshitz\ntransition in which the isoenergetic line about each valley\nis broken into four pockets.\nInter-layer asymmetry creates a gap between the con-\nduction and valence bands: bilayer graphene is a semicon-\nductor with a tuneable gap of up to about 0.4eV. However,\nby comparing the charging energy with the single particle\nenergy, it is possible to show that an undoped, gapless bi-\nlayer is stable with respect to the spontaneous opening of a\ngap via a ferroelectric transistion. A self-consistent Hartree\napproximation was used to determine the density distribu-\ntion of the two layers when the density n is varied using an\nasymmetrically placed gate, resulting in a density depen-\ndent gap \u2206(n). Control of the gap has been modelled using\nthe tight-bindingmodel [16,17,12] and such calculations ap-\npear to be in good agreement with ARPES measurements\n[9], observations made in the regime of the quantum Hall\neffect [17], and density functional theory calculations [12].\nThe use of a single gate modulates the density and the\ngap simultaneously, but it should be possible to indepen-\ndently control the density and the gap by employing both a\ntop and a bottom gate. This suggests a route to new nano-\nelectronic devices defined within a single sheet of gated bi-\nlayer graphene. In particular, one can use a combination of\ntop and bottom gates to control the asymmetry gap in the\nbilayer spectrum and to define an array of quantum dots\non a sizeable bilayer sheet. By localizing electrons on such\ndots and electrically controlling their coupling, this may\nenable one to produce arrays [31] of electron spin qubits for\nquantum information processing [32].\nThe authors thank I.

At\n\u01ebF \u2248 \u01ebL, trigonal warping term causes the Lifshitz transition in the\ntopology of the Fermi line in each valley as explained in Section 4.\n[28] G. Dresselhaus, Phys. Rev.

For huge values of the asymmetry |\u2206| \u226b \u03b31,\nthe gap would saturate at \u2206\u02dc \u2248 \u03b31 although for modest asymmetry\nvalues |\u2206| \u226a \u03b31, the relation is simply \u2206\u02dc \u2248 |\u2206|.\n[30] In Section 5 we neglected the role of additional weak couplings,\nsuch as A1-B2 coupling \u03b33 that results in trigonal warping,\nSection 4, and is relevant at low density n \u223c 1\u00d71011cm\u22122. Indeed,\ntrigonal warping should result in a small overlap between the\nconduction and valence band of \u2248 2meV.\n[31] V.I.
