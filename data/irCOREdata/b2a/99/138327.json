Introduction\nThe rising costs of treating water and wastewater and the increasing requirement for clean\nwater is prompting industry and authorities to examine new methods for water conservation.\nConventional chemical methods used for the analysis of water and wastewater can be\naccurate, but are mainly based on sample collection and retrospective analyses. The recent\navailability of commercial sensor arrays (so-called electronic noses, e-nose) for detecting and\ncharacterizing headspace odours may offer a more rapid and relatively simple technique for\nmonitoring changes in water and wastewater quality (Gostelow et al., 2001).\nThe e-nose mimics the human olfaction system which consists of three essential\nelements: an array of olfactory receptor cells situated in the roof of the nasal cavity, the\nolfactory bulb which is situated just above the nasal cavity, and the brain. In an e-nose there\nare three components; (a) a sampling conditioning unit, which delivers the odour volatiles\nfrom the head space of the sample, (b) a test chamber in which the sensor array is based; and\n(c) a processing unit which analyses the sensor responses for pattern recognition. The sensor\narray is composed of a certain number of sensors (6-32). The most common materials used\nfor gas sensors are metal oxides, conducting polymers, and catalytic metals. The use of an\narray of non-specific sensors allows for the relative responses between the sensors to be used\nto produce a unique odour profile or fingerprint of an odour. The odour profile can then be\nfurther analysed using pattern recognition techniques and\/or neural network algorithms\n(Stuetz et al., 1998).\nThe applications of e-nose technology have been widely reported for early detection\nand identification of microorganisms and signs of food spoilage (Pavlou et al., 2000; Magan\net al., 2001; Keshri et al., 2002). The e-nose has also been used to detect the volatiles emitted\nby growing bacteria (Gibson et al., 1997; McEntegart et al., 2000). These studies have\n4generally been done with high concentrations of bacteria, centrifuged cell biomass, or\ncolonies of bacteria grown on an agar surface. In view of these reports, the key issue with the\nuse of the e-nose in microbial detection is sensitivity rather than selectivity.\nUntil now, the application of this technique in environmental measurements has been\nlimited. For example, recently it was demonstrated that conducting polymer sensors can\ndistinguish between distilled water and distilled water that contains low levels of organic\npollutants, suggesting that such a system could be used to screen for tainting compounds in\nsupply waters (Stuetz et al., 1998; Dewettinck et al., 2001; Ogawa and Sugimoto, 2002).\nCurrently pollution by heavy metals is one of our most serious environmental\nproblems. Chemical contaminants in drinking water can be present together with numerous\nother inorganic and organic constituents. These can include cadmium, lead and zinc, as\nimpurities from the household plumbing systems, in which the pipes, solder or fitting contain\nsome of these metals (World Health Organization, 1996). So far, there are no studies using\nthe e-nose technology to detect heavy metals in water.\nThe objectives of the present study was to investigate the potential use of an e-nose\nsystem employing a 14 conducting polymer sensor array, to sample the headspace volatiles\noriginating from both microbial and metal aqueous solutions. The potential for differentiation\nbetween such contaminants was examined.\n2. Experimental\n2.1 Cultural media and incubation\nThe following bacterial species obtained from the UK National Culture Collections\nwere used in this study: Enterobacter aerogenes (88), Escherichia coli (10000) and\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (8672). A concentration of 102, 104 and 108 colony forming units\n(CFUs) mL \u20131 for each species was incubated at 25\u00baC for a period of 24 h. These\n5concentration were obtained by correlating absorbance (640 nm, visible light) of different\nconcentrations of cells and actual number of colonies using the spread plate technique.\nFor heavy metals, samples were prepared by adding a mixture of the heavy metals\n(As, Cd, Pb and Zn) to non-sterile water, to obtain a 10 ml aqueous mixed metal solution in\ntwo different concentrations, 0.5 and 2.0 ppm. Where the bacterial species were mixed with\nthe heavy metals, the final concentrations were adjusted to 104 and 106 CFUs mL-1. Samples\nwere incubated for 24 hrs at 25oC.\n2.2 Gas sampling and sensing procedure\nEach sample was connected with a specially made air-filter system, which consisted\nof a pair of 6 cm long Teflon tubing segments (Tygon), a bio-filter (0.45 \uf06dm, PTFE\nWhatman, HepaVent), and an activated carbon filter (Whatman) to ensure clean air flow\nabove the aqueous solution samples headspace (Pavlou et al., 2000).\nAn electronic nose (model BH-114: Bloodhound Sensors Ltd., Leeds, UK), which\nemploys 14 conducting polymer sensors, was used in this study. Activated carbon filtered air\nis passed over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 4 mL min-1 to generate the sensor baseline.\nThe electronic nose was flushed and a one minute interval was allowed between each sample.\nSamples were analysed in a random pattern including the controls. Three replicates were used\nfor each treatment and repeated twice.\n2.3 Data analysis\nThe Bloodhound e-nose provides the following data for each of the 14 sensors. These\nare adsorption (maximum rate of change of resistance), desorption (maximum negative rate\nof change of resistance), divergence (maximum step response) and area (area under the actual\nsensor curve) (Pavlou et al., 2000). In this study the normalised data for divergence and area\n6were analysed using the program xlSTAT (Microsoft Excel add-in). Multivariate techniques\nsuch as Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) and\nCluster Analysis (CA) were applied to represent the sensors response.\n3. Results and Discussion\nFigure 1 shows the PCA obtained from normalised divergence and area data of the\nsensors response to two types of water, bottled and reverse osmosis (RO), treated with 0.5\nppm of a mixed metal solution (As, Cd, Pb and Zn), and RO water (non-sterile) was used as a\ncontrol sample. It can be seen that the e-nose was able to distinguish tainted water samples\nfrom control ones. The non-sterile (control) water sample contains a low total population of\nbacteria (< 10-50 CFU ml-1) and their activity would be modified by the presence of the\nheavy metals. This would account for modified volatile production patterns which were\ndetected qualitatively by the e-nose.\nFigure 2 represents the sensor responses to E. coli cells inoculated and un-inoculated\nwith 0.5 ppm of the metal mixture mentioned above, and controls. There was a good\nseparation between the controls (RO water), and samples containing bacteria plus metals and\nthose containing bacteria only.\nFrom the Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) plots on the raw data values, it was\npossible to differentiate between control samples and those containing bacteria. Figure 3\nshows the discrimination for P. aeruginosa incubated for 24 hours at 30\u00baC, and Figure 4 for\nE. aerogenes incubated for 48 hours at the same temperature. After 48 h a clear four-group\nseparation was achieved. The inability to differentiate between 102 and 104 CFUs ml-1\ntreatments may be due to similar quantities of volatiles being produced in the water at these\nbacterial concentrations. This suggests that the limit of detection for these bacteria is between\n7102 and 104, and this group are clearly separated from the control. The results were\nconsistent, as similar responses were obtained in repeat experiments on different days.\nThis is one of the first studies to examine the potential of using e-nose technology to\ndifferentiate water samples on the basis of qualitative volatile production pattern due to\nmicrobial or metal interaction. This study shows that potential does exists for detecting the\npresence of quite low concentrations (0.5 ppm) of important contaminants in water. The\npresence of low quantities of heavy metals may modify the activity of microorganisms and\nthus the volatile production patterns enabling further separation to be made. The use of non-\nsterile water can be the reason why it was possible to detect the presence of heavy metals in\nRO and bottled water. Fewtrell et al. (1997) carried out a survey on the microbiological\nquality of still bottled water. The results have revealed that almost 2% of the examined\nsamples failed to meet the required microbiological standards.\nThe use of conducting polymer arrays for the discrimination of such samples has been\nsuccessful in other media, e.g. milk-based liquid media where volatiles compounds produced\nby spoilage bacteria and yeasts using an initial inoculum of about 103 \u2013 104 CFU ml-1 (Magan\net al., 2001) could be discriminated. McEntegart et al. (2000) reported the detection of\nbacteria in liquid media, of about 5x108 cells ml-1, using a mixture of three sensor types. So\nfar, 102 - 104 CFUs ml-1 is the lowest level at which microbial contaminants can be detected\nusing volatile production patterns. Other studies have tried to use the e-nose for real time\nmonitoring of waste water streams by measuring changes in general odour production\n(Bourgeois et al., 2001). Such approaches have been successful for the detection of fungal\ncontaminants in grain where a prototype automated system was developed and found to\noperate effectively (Evans et al., 2000).\n84. Conclusions\nPotential exists for the early detection of microorganisms, and of low concentrations\nof heavy metals in different types of water. An opportunity also exists to extend this approach\nfor the early detection of off-odours due to methylation of chlorinated phenols by fungi and\nactinomycetes which are important, especially in the summer months.\n5.
