INTRODUCTION\nVARIABLE speed generators are used for large turbines,as they can extract more energy with attenuated struc-\ntural stresses and acoustic emissions compared to fixed speed\nsystems. The doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) with a\npartially rated rotor side converter is currently the mainstream\ntechnology in the market for large wind turbines. But other\ntopologies exist and new ones are being developed at lower\ncost with higher performance and reliability. For instance, low\nspeed, direct drive generators offer a specific reliability benefit\nby eliminating the gearbox. Among the concepts pursued by\ndifferent teams, permanent magnet generators with air-cored\nor iron-cored and slotless geometries have been particularly\ndeveloped at Durham University [1], [2]. The air-cored gen-\nerator features a light structure and large diameter to increase\nManuscript received September 5, 2007; revised October 25, 2007.

The slotless design could be of smaller diameter\nbut would also incorporate a large number of isolated stator\ncoils. In either case the objective is to reduce the generator\nweight for large direct drive wind turbine applications of output\ngreater than 4.5 MW. This leads to light machine constructions\nin which the air gap dimensions are relatively flexible under\nself-weight and load conditions, resulting in variations in the\nemfs developed in the coils.\nThis paper is a study of the electronic power conversion stage\nof such wind turbines aimed at application on such generators.\nIn many direct drive systems, including the one that is con-\ncerned here, fully rated converters are required to control the\ngenerator and interface to the grid. Commercially available con-\nverters can be costly but also limited regarding the control func-\ntions needed for grid connection. This study demonstrates a new\nmodular converter with a switching strategy that can be inte-\ngrated into a modular permanent magnet generator so that the\noverall performance, cost and reliability can be improved.\nIt is quite easy to obtain a high current rating with a voltage\nsource converter but to obtain high voltage rating can be costly.\nTherefore in most wind turbine systems, a step-up transformer\nis needed on the grid side. In an onshore horizontal axis tur-\nbine, the generator and converter are housed in the nacelle at\nthe top of the tower. However the step-up transformer is usu-\nally located at ground level. In wind turbines with yaw control,\nwhich usually means large turbines, electrical power is trans-\nmitted from the nacelle using droop cables. In order to cope with\nexcessive wind-up or twisting, a cable length margin is incorpo-\nrated of up to three to four times tower height. In low voltage\nsystems therefore high current flows through cables of consid-\nerable length, induce significant loss. Paralleling the cables\nreduces the loss but increases initial cost as high current cables\nare expensive. There are modified transformer designs which\naim to reduce the size and weight so that the transformer can be\nincluded in the nacelle. In spite of the progress made, this adds\nsignificantly to the mechanical loading of the tower and hence\nhas mainly been adopted in offshore turbines where estate at\nsea level is costly. Wind farm developers often use transformers\nthat are marginally rated, to minimize the component cost. The\nreliability of the whole system is then reduced. Records show\nthat failures of these components have caused significant down-\ntime in existing wind farms [3]\u2013[5] and it is essential to improve\nthe reliability of large wind turbines if they are to be positioned\noffshore. It is therefore desirable to develop a generator-con-\nverter system that can still be housed in the nacelle but output at\n0885-8993\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

There are also\ncost considerations for the architecture of the generator and con-\nverter architecture as described in [6].\nCommercial two-level voltage source converters are usually\nof low voltage design limited by the device rating. The max-\nimum ac voltage is 690 V using 1700 V IGBTs. Multilevel con-\nverters can provide higher voltage rating but cannot be obtained\nas an off-the-shelf product. A well known technical difficulty of\na multilevel converter is balancing the dc link voltages in par-\nticular when the converter is processing real power [7]\u2013[9].\nThis paper shows a method of applying a modular multi-\nlevel converter to a permanent magnet generator with a large\nnumber of isolated coils. A simplified representation of the gen-\nerator-converter arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. The coil volt-\nages are actively rectified to stabilize the dc links. This avoids\nthe fundamental problem of balancing the dc link voltages but\ninitial study indicates that three issues must be addressed in\norder for the system to achieve the intended objectives.\nDC link voltages contain second order etc. harmonics which\ncause zero sequence harmonic voltages at the ac output. In the\npresent application, the multilevel modules are connected in a\nthree-phase star with neutral earthed to allow detection of phase\nto ground fault. The wind farm transformer is configured in\n- for the same reason, providing a zero sequence current\npath. The switching strategy must prevent any adverse modula-\ntion which will otherwise be absorbed by over-sizing the system\ncomponents.\nIn order to produce a genuine modular design, the power ex-\ntracted from each generator coil should ideally be equal. The\ndc link voltage balancing issue is translated into the require-\nment for equalizing the real power that is extracted from each\ndc link level. The switching strategy of the multilevel inverter\nmust therefore equalize real power sharing between the con-\nverter levels.\nIdentical coils and converter modules could then be\nmass-manufactured to reduce individual costs and raise system\nreliability. Fault tolerant operation could also be achieved as a\nresult.\nAn overall control strategy is used to regulate the output real\npower of the converter according to the speed of the turbine for\nmaximum power tracking [10]. This is achieved by changing the\nphase angle of the output voltage. In order to control the output\nreactive power, the voltage amplitude is controlled, requiring\ncontrol of each of the dc link average voltages. This is achieved\nby using an active rectifier for each coil as shown in Fig. 1. In\naddition to the above three issues, a transformer-less configu-\nration must prevent dc current injection into the grid [11]. The\nraised output voltage of the converter reduces the output current\nand developments in instrumentation have enabled active can-\ncellation of dc current injection by feedback control [12], [13]\nbut this issue is not considered further in this paper. Results re-\ngarding the dynamic behaviour of the converter during grid dis-\nturbances are presented in [14].\nThis paper derives a steady state switching strategy for the\nmultilevel inverter by addressing the above three issues using\nsimulation and a 2.5 kW experimental machine and modular\nconverter system. An 11 kV, 1.8 MW wind turbine system is\nFig. 1.

It is assumed that the gen-\nerator design can always be arranged to provide the necessary\nnumber of coils and the phase relationship between the coil\nvoltages.\nSection II outlines the main reasons for adopting the gener-\nator-converter configuration. Section III analyzes the harmonic\ncharacteristics, which depend on the switching strategy and af-\nfect the sizing of some components, in particular the dc link\ncapacitors. Section IV derives the desired switching strategy by\nconsidering the requirement of power sharing and determining\nthe optimum switching angles. Section V gives an experimental\nevaluation of the scheme and presents the experimental results.\nSection VI supports the experimental results by further simula-\ntion studies on a full scale system.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Multilevel cascaded voltage source inverter (11-level) configuration and\nits output voltage waveform.\nII. MULTILEVEL CASCADED VOLTAGE\nSOURCE INVERTER (MCVSI)\nH-bridge inverter modules are connected in series on the\noutput ac side to form an MCVSI. The dc link of each module is\nstabilized by active rectifiers fed from generator coils. The total\ninput power into each dc link can be controlled to be ripple free,\nexcept for the high frequency spikes due to switching of the\nactive rectifiers. Referring to Fig. 1(b), each dc link is supplied\nby two generator coils. The active rectifier controls the current\nextracted from each coil so that a unity power factor is obtained\nat the coil terminals. Constant dc side power is obtained if the\nsinusoidal voltages of the two coils are phase shifted by 90 s\nas shown in (1) below. The coil voltage ( ) depends on the\nmachine speed while current ( ) is set by the control loop to\nstabilize the dc link voltage\n(1)\nOne phase of the grid inverter and its output voltage wave-\nform using the standard switching scheme [15] are expanded\nin Fig. 2, taking as an example a five-module system resulting\nin an 11-level phase-neutral voltage waveform. The dc link volt-\nages of the inverter modules, which are assumed to be equal, are\nswitched to synthesize the desired sinusoidal waveform. Each\nmodule operates according to a switching function which can\nbe considered as taking values of 1, 0 and 1 corresponding\nto , 0 and respectively at the ac output of the module\nwhere is the dc link voltage. The standard switching angles\nfor different number of modules can be found in [16] and they\nare set to reduce the output harmonic content. The module duty\ncycles are different causing unequal real power sharing, which\nwill be addressed later.\nThere exist other multilevel inverter topologies, in particular\nthe neutral point clamped (NPC) and flying capacitors (FC).\nThey all aim to reduce the voltage stress on the individual\nswitching devices in high voltage applications. The switching\nfrequency of each device is kept low, resulting in low switching\nTABLE I\nUNITS FOR MAGNETIC PROPERTIES\nFig. 3. THD for different MCVSI levels.\nlosses. Compared to others, the MCVSI topology has been\nadopted in this study because of its following features [8]:\n1) a modular construction, allowing the use of large numbers\nof identical, mass-produced, high reliability modules and\nthe possibility of a high degree of fault-tolerance;\n2) fewer power semiconductor devices compared to the NPC\nand FC topologies;\n3) no clamping diodes compared to the NPC topology;\n4) fewer reservoir capacitors compared to the FC topology.\nThe numbers of active semiconductor switching devices,\ndiodes and capacitors required by the three types of multilevel\ninverters are listed in Table I for a comparison purpose, where\nis the number of levels in the synthesized output phase\nvoltage.\nIII. MCVSI HARMONIC DISTORTION\nThe dc link voltages of an MCVSI are often assumed to be\nconstant and identical. With the standard switching scheme,\nthe ac harmonic distortion depends on the voltage quantization\nlevel, hence a higher level MCVSI will always produce a less\ndistorted output [17], [18]. Fig. 3 shows the total harmonic\ndistortion (THD, % of fundamental) of the output phase voltage\nfor different MCVSI levels, . It is observed that, the harmonic\ndistortion indeed reduces with increased level of cascading.\nWith finite dc link capacitance, the dc link voltages could\ncontain a large second order harmonic of the fundamental output\nfrequency. This depends on the load level and is the result of\nthe switching function of each inverter module being modulated\nby the fundamental output current [19]. It can be shown that in\nsuch a case there is a mechanism that gives rise to additional,\npredominantly third order, harmonics in the output voltage of\nthe inverter. These harmonics are of zero phase sequence. Due\nto the earthed neutral arrangement of the generator, shown in\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

MCVSI ac side harmonic distortion.\nFig. 1(c), such harmonics can cause detrimental effects in the\nsystem [20]. The second order harmonic current to be absorbed\non the dc side of an inverter module is\n(2)\nwhere is the fundamental output current and\nthe fundamental component of the switching function associ-\nated with the H-bridge module concerned.\nThe inverter module\u2019s fundamental switching harmonic,\n, will then modulate with the second order harmonic\nvoltage of the dc link and transfer to the ac side as a third order\nharmonic voltage and consequently current\n(3)\nwhere is the reactance of the dc link capacitor at the\nsecond order harmonic frequency. The resultant third order har-\nmonic current is only limited by the zero sequence harmonic\nimpedance in the output circuit, which is usually low.\nIn practice, complex modulating interactions occur in the\nsystem because the switching functions contain more than\nsecond order harmonics and the inverter output current is\nalready distorted. As a result, a series of additional harmonics\ncan be generated in the inverter output voltage. Obviously the\ninteractions depend on the output load current of the inverter.\nIf this is to be compensated by modifying the switching pattern\nof the inverter, the controller must work in closed loop as the\noperating point changes.\nFor the 1.8 MW system that is detailed later in the Section VI,\nFig. 4 shows the simulated third order harmonic in the output\nvoltage assuming that the system operates at full load. The\nchange of THD with the number of voltage levels ( ) is shown\nin Fig. 5. Four different values of the dc link capacitance are\ncompared. It is observed that the third order harmonic in the\noutput voltage increases with the number of voltage levels and\nis always significant compared with the THD values previously\nshown in Fig. 3 for the ideal case. Although the dc link capac-\nitance attenuates the adverse interaction, it is hardly possible\nFig. 5. Inverter output voltage THD.\nto constrain the THD below 3% if the capacitance is less than\n4000 F.\nThe capacitors can account for more than half of the total\ncomponent cost of a power converter module. They also occupy\na large footprint, making the modules larger than they need to\nbe. Given the voltage rating in the application, the size and cost\nof the dc link capacitors are determined mainly by two factors:\n1) the ripple current to be absorbed which determines the power\nlosses in the capacitors and 2) the allowable ripple of the dc\nlink voltage. Design experience in high power converter sys-\ntems shows that the capacitors will be excessively large if the\ncapacitance is selected to keep the dc link voltage ripple accept-\nably small for the purpose of avoiding the adverse modulating\neffect such as that analyzed above [21]. The switching strategy\nis therefore required to accept the non-constant dc link voltages.\nIV. PROPOSED SWITCHING STRATEGY\nThe analysis above shows that the third order harmonic and\nother modulation products in the inverter output voltage caused\nby the non-constant dc link voltages will become a dominant\nissue when the number of the synthesized voltage levels in-\ncreases. This will exceed the gain being made in terms of finer\nvoltage quantization. The distortion can be reduced by using\nlarger dc link capacitors but the drawback will be the increased\ncost and larger footprint. A new switching strategy is proposed\nto solve the problem, by means of which the harmonic distor-\ntion can be reduced without using costly and large capacitors.\nA. Equalized Power Sharing\nIn addition to harmonic distortion, unequal electrical power\ndistribution between cascaded modules has been a common\nproblem for the conventional fundamental frequency switching\nMCVSI. Referring to Fig. 2, unequal duty cycle distribution\ncauses some modules to be more heavily loaded than others.\nThis reduces the utilization of the semiconductor devices\nand is against the concept of a modular design where it is\ndesirable, from a fault-tolerant point of view, for all modules\nto be identical. Therefore, in spite of the fact that the dc link\nvoltage balancing is no longer an issue because dc link voltages\nare independently provided by isolated coils and rectifiers,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Integral cycle switching scheme.\nFig. 7. Half cycle symmetrical switching scheme.\nequalized power sharing between the inverter modules is still a\ndesirable feature for the system being developed.\nF. Z. Peng et al. [22], [23] suggested an integral cycle\nswitching scheme as illustrated in Fig. 6, for the MCVSI to\nbalance the power sharing between the modules.\nThis switching scheme gives a very balanced average power\nsharing between all the modules, to be shown later in Fig. 10.\nHowever, in reality, an inter-cycle difference of power still exists\nin each module. It can be shown that depending on the output\nphase voltage level \u2018 \u2019, such a half cycle rotating switching\nscheme causes significant low order harmonics, predominantly\nat frequency of 2 1 Hz, in the output voltage of the mul-\ntilevel inverter if the dc link capacitance is insufficient.\nThe half cycle symmetrical switching scheme is shown in\nFig. 7. The switching functions of all the modules are of the\nsame width but phase shifted in order to synthesize the output\nwaveform. For the same output current flowing through all the\nmodules, the power factor with respect to the individual funda-\nmental output voltage is different from one module to another.\nAs a result, the real power varies, with the modules in the centre\ntaking more power than the modules on the top or bottom of the\ncascaded phase if the overall output power factor is unity. In this\ncase, the pattern of real power sharing changes with the overall\noutput power factor, as to be shown later.\nFig. 8. Half cycle asymmetrical switching scheme.\nFig. 9. 11-level MCVSI power sharing curve (unity power factor).\nFig. 10. 11-level MCVSI power sharing (injecting reactive power, power\nfactor: 0.81).\nTo correct this, an improved switching strategy is shown in\nFig. 8. Similar to other switching schemes, the switching func-\ntion of each module is defined by four phase angles which are\ndetermined trigonometrically as follows:\n(4)\n(5)\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

It is assumed that 0.\nThis switching scheme is termed asymmetrical because the\nswitching function waveform is neither even nor half wave\nsymmetrical. It is found that the fundamental components of all\nthe switching functions are of similar amplitudes and in phase\nwith each other. Consequently real power sharing between\nthe modules is insensitive to the output power factor and is\npre-determined.\nFor different number of modules, the switching angles can\nbe readily calculated and some results are shown in Table II,\nstarting from five modules converter.\nSimulation results for the power sharing in an 11-level (five\nmodules per phase) MCVSI with four different switching\nschemes including the three described in this section and the\nstandard one previously described in Fig. 2, are compared in\nFig. 9. The effect of reactive power demand on the different\nswitching schemes is shown in Figs. 10 and 11. The integral\ncycle switching scheme was not adopted because of its gener-\nation of low frequency harmonics due to inter-cycle variation.\nThe simulation results indicate that, apart from integral cycle\nscheme, the asymmetrical half cycle switching scheme gives\na relatively good and consistent power sharing profile, which\nis insensitive to the output real and reactive power demand.\nFig. 12 shows the power variation comparison for different\nlevels of MCVSI when the proposed asymmetrical switching\nFig. 11. 11-level MCVSI power sharing (absorbing reactive power, power\nfactor: 0.86).\nstrategy and conventional fundamental frequency switching\nstrategy are used. It is clear that the percentage difference, with\nrespect to the average module power, decreases with higher\nlevel MCVSI. The advantage of the proposed equal power\nsharing scheme is most conspicuous on configurations with\nfewer levels. This could occur when some of the modules have\nfailed during fault tolerant operation.\nB. Harmonic Compensation\nAs demonstrated in Section III, the use of a fundamental fre-\nquency switching scheme at each module causes third order etc.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Maximum power variation between modules with different MCVSI\nlevels.\nFig. 13. Conventional hybrid MCVSI (PWM active harmonic filter added).\nharmonics on the output ac side of the MCVSI. The switching\nstrategy for equal power sharing affects the amplitudes of the\nharmonics but would not remove the mechanism by which the\nharmonics are generated. In a transformer-less configuration,\nharmonic filters would be required to suppress these harmonics.\nAn active harmonic filter may be more suitable as the harmonic\ncontents are close to the fundamental frequency. The use of a\npassive filter would increase the risk of resonance.\nA hybrid MCVSI, incorporating an active harmonic filter cas-\ncaded with other modules of the MCVSI, as shown in Fig. 13,\ncould be used to eliminate the ac side harmonic distortion. How-\never, an active filter module, which operates at higher switching\nfrequency ( ), causes higher switching losses and results in\nhigher electrical stresses leading to higher failure rate. It is worst\nin the situation where high level ac side harmonic distortion is\nrequired to be filtered out. Failure of the active filter module\nwill have serious consequences as the entire system has to be\nshut down for repair and replacement, defeating the objective\nof a modular design.\nAn improved equal power sharing MCVSI switching strategy\nhas been developed in this study. The proposed switching\nstrategy integrates the active harmonic filtering action into the\nFig. 14. Block diagram of the proposed MCVSI and its switching waveforms.\nordinary MCVSI modules that would otherwise operate at the\nfundamental frequency, as shown in the Fig. 8. In such integra-\ntion, all modules in the same phase share the load real power\nas well as the switching burden\/losses for active filtering. The\nconcept of the proposed switching strategy is shown in Fig. 14.\nIn such a way, no dedicated module is required for harmonic\nfiltering as the duty of active filter is shared by all modules in\nthe same output phase. A set of three-level PWM carrier signals\nwith frequency and consecutive phase shifts by\nan increment of will be assigned to each of the\nmodules, where is the overall switching frequency of the\nactive filter and is the number of the output voltage levels.\nAn error signal generated by the control loop, which responds to\nthe distortion of the output phase voltage, is used as the common\nreference to all the modules to compare with the phase shifted\ncarrier signals, which determines the extra switching action re-\nquired to compensate the harmonic distortion. Referring to the\ngeneralized control waveforms shown in Fig. 15, if a module\nis in \u201cON\u201d state, i.e., outputting a positive or negative dc link\nvoltage, additional \u201cnotches\u201d can be caused to reduce the av-\nerage output voltage in the corresponding direction. Similarly\nif the module is in \u201cOFF\u201d state, i.e., ideally outputting 0 V,\nadditional pulses can be produced in the appropriate direction\nto modify the overall output voltage. As a result, the effect of\nthe dc link voltage variation is compensated by the additional\npulse width modulation. In general the required compensation\nto the output voltage is relatively small, additional \u201cnotches\u201d\nor \u201cpulses\u201d are also small and have little impact on the power\nsharing objective that is achieved by the basic fundamental fre-\nquency switching function previously described. Since the ac-\ntive filtering duty is shared by all the modules, the increase of\nswitching frequency is only marginal.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION\nThe proposed control concept has been experimentally eval-\nuated on a relatively small scale laboratory test rig as shown in\nFig. 16(a), with block diagram shown in Fig. 17.\nEach converter module consists of a power board and a local\ncontrol board as shown in Fig. 16(b). The power board includes\nthe active and passive elements for two rectifiers, one H-bridge\ninverter, the dc link, and some measuring and protecting el-\nements. TMS320F2808 DSP is the core of the control board\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham. Downloaded on April 13,2010 at 15:37:16 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

A DS1103 dSpace real time control system, which\ncan be programmed in the Matlab\/Simulink environment, is the\nhigh level master controller which communicates to the 12 con-\nverter modules via a CAN bus. The main function of the dSpace\nFig. 17. Block diagram of laboratory test rig.\ncontroller is to ensure the synchronization of all modules, to\ncontrol the harmonic compensation and to control the output\nreal and reactive power. CAN communication, which is based\non the series communication protocol, has been implemented in\norder to minimize the data connections between individual mod-\nules and the master controller unit with deterministic time delay\n( 200 s) which can be compensated through close loop con-\ntrol for the output power. The feature of CAN allows a single\ncentral controller to communicate with multiple modules, 12\nin this case, that are connected in series along the CAN net-\nwork with only a single two-way twisted pair cable. In addition,\nthe advantages in terms of noise rejection and data transferring\nspeed also encouraged the use of CAN in the prototype. The\nwind turbine is emulated using a multi-coils axial flux perma-\nnent magnet generator driven by an induction motor in torque\ncontrol.\nThe proposed power sharing control scheme is tested under\nvarious output power factor conditions. Fig. 18 shows the per-\nphase output voltage and current for PF 1 and PF 0.55, re-\nspectively. Power sharing profiles of the conventional funda-\nmental frequency switching scheme and the proposed switching\nscheme, at different power factors, are shown in Fig. 19. It is\nshown that, in agreement with the simulation result, the pro-\nposed switching scheme gives much better power sharing char-\nacteristics compared to the conventional switching scheme.\nFigs. 20 and 21 show the inverter output voltage, its harmonic\nspectrum and the control error signal before and after imple-\nmenting the harmonic compensation scheme that was described\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

It is observed that the proposed com-\npensation scheme has significantly reduced the dominant third\norder harmonic (150 Hz) voltage, from 2.34 V to 0.58 V.

Al-\nthough the experiment was carried out on a system that had\nbeen significantly scaled down, it serves the purpose to verify\nthe control algorithm.

In this simulation, the dc link capacitance was further\nreduced to 2200 F to demonstrate the performance of the pro-\nposed switching scheme. The output voltage and line current\nproduced by inverter with this capacitance are shown in Fig. 27.\nAs previously mentioned, the proposed MCVSI control scheme\nstops harmonic current flow being modulated between the dc\nand ac sides of the MCVSI.

The proposed switching strategy maintains\nthe inter-modules power variation within 2.5% for a 25-level\nMCVSI, while 11.5% power variation is observed with the con-\nventionally switched MCVSI.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThis paper describes a modular power electronics solution\nfor a transformer-less wind energy conversion system, which\ncould deliver lower cost, high reliability, fault-tolerance for\nlightweight, direct drive air-cored or iron-cored slotless genera-\ntors for large wind turbines. The features and application of the\nmultilevel cascaded voltage source inverter are analyzed in this\npaper. The requirement of equalized power sharing between\nlevels has been identified and resolved using a new switching\nstrategy which also compensates the inherent harmonic inter-\naction in the converter system.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Power sharing profiles of the conventional and proposed switched\nMCVSI.\nThree-phase star connection of the converter modules is\npossible to emulate a synchronous generator for protection\npurposes. Increasing the dc link capacitance of each converter\nmodule could improve the harmonic performance, but capac-\nitors are costly and often come with relatively large physical\nsizes. The proposed switching scheme combines the funda-\nmental frequency and multilevel PWM switching strategies.\nBy equally distributing the PWM duties to all the modules\nof the MCVSI, high switching stresses are avoided. This is\nmade possible by the low frequency phase shifted PWM duty\ncycles synthesized in each module, resulting in a high overall\nswitching frequency viewed at the output of the inverter,\nwhich is sufficient to perform overall harmonic elimination.\nSimulations and experiments are carried out to evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed technique, and the results are\npromising.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Z.
