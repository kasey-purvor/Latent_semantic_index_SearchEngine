Introduction\nThis paper revisits the classical linear stability problem for a two-fluid Poiseuille\nflow in a planar channel. The problem has been approached by many authors from\ndifferent angles. A long-wave asymptotic analysis performed by Yih (1967)\nillustrates the origin of interfacial instability in the flow. In general, interfacial\nmodes can coexist with instability of a Tollmien\u2013Schlichting variety, which is more\ncommon for a channel flow. This was studied computationally by Blennerhassett\n(1980) where the focus was on linear and nonlinear waves in a two-layer flow of air\nover water with equal layer depths. Yiantsios &Higgins (1988) performed accurate\ncomputations for linear instabilities in a Poiseuille flow with two superimposed\nfluids. Their workwas centred on the behaviour of the interfacial wavemode and its\ndependence on the relative depths and kinematic viscosities of fluid layers. Hooper\n(1989) studied instabilities in a Poiseuille\u2013Couette channel flow of two viscous\nfluids. An extensive review of the stability problem for a two-layer plane channel\nflow can be found in Joseph & Renardy (1993).\nThe formulation in this paper follows the early work by Blennerhassett (1980).\nWe consider a two layer air\u2013water configuration, with the majority of the results\nobtained for the case of equal layer depths. The focus will be on two issues. First,Re\nAcProc. R. Soc.

Neutral stability curves for interfacial waves and the stable region loop. (a) Interfacial\nwaves neutral curve and loop. (b) Loop.\nE. Shapiro and S. Timoshin1584in a search for novel instability modes, we extend the results of Blennerhassett to\nhigher Reynolds numbers. The second, and perhaps more interesting issue, stems\nfrom the following remarkable property. Blennerhassett\u2019s neutral stability curves\nin fig. 2 of his paper (Blennerhassett 1980), reproduced in our figure 1a (where k\nand Re denote the wavenumber and Reynolds number) from our computations,\nclearly show a broadband interfacial instability in the flow starting from the\nReynolds number 3848.24.\nIn addition, a narrow band of waves marked by a neutral curve starting at the\nReynolds number of 8641.96, indicates the appearance of a second instabilitymode.\nBlennerhassett attributed this second instability to a Tollmien\u2013Schlichting\nmechanism. However, we found that the narrow neutral curve in figure 1a was in\nfact a loop closed down at Reynolds numbers of order 20 000, see figure 1b. As we\nshall show in this paper, the region inside the loop corresponds to decaying waves,\ncontrary towhatmight be inspected in the case ofTollmien\u2013Schlichting instability.\nFrom a physical standpoint, of major significance is the fact (entirely omitted in\nBlennerhassett\u2019s computations) that neutral-wave solutions for the points on the\nloop can be connected through a wavenumber continuation with the solutions on\nthe broad-band interfacial neutral curve. This observation (illustrated in detail\nbelow) raises the question of physical identity for various instability modes in the\nflow. We will show that the neutral curves in figure 1 (and further neutral curves\ndiscovered at higher Reynolds numbers) are a product of a complicated interaction\nand intersection of several key modes associated with three more or less distinct\ninstability mechanisms, namely the interfacial instability and two Tollmien\u2013\nSchlichting instabilities, for the flow in the air and water layers. In particular,\nTollmien\u2013Schlichting instabilities are found to arise as two initially distinct modes\nat Reynolds numbers of order of 15 000, which is beyond the Reynolds number\nrange covered in Blennerhassett (1980).\nIt is not uncommon for a neutral curve of a layered flow to have several branches.\nYiantsios&Higgins (1988)were probably the first to note that the interfacial waves\ncan be stabilized in a certain range of wavenumbers. Later, the same effect was\nnoted by Kuru et al. (1995), Miesen & Boersma (1995) and Sangalli et al. (1997). It\nappears that under certain conditions the curve of the growth rate as a functionProc.

The formation of this stable region can also\nbe seen in the study of interfacial waves behaviour in oil\u2013water channel flows\npresented by McCready et al. (1997). Another reason for the appearance of\ncomplicated neutral curve diagrams in two-fluid flow is a mode crossing between\ninterfacial and Tollmien\u2013Schlichting waves considered for a boundary layer with\nhighReynoldsnumbers inOzgen et al. (1998) andTimoshin&Hooper (2000). In our\nstudy, we find both the interfacial mode splitting and interfacial\/Tollmien\u2013\nSchlichting wave interaction are present in certain ranges of the wavenumber. In\nwhat follows we refer to the modes of interfacial instability, Tollmien\u2013Schlichting\ninstability due to air flow and Tollmien\u2013Schlichting instability in water (liquid) as\nthe I-mode, TSA-mode and TSL-mode, respectively.2. Problem formulation\nAssuming a flow in a horizontal channel, we use the upper (air) layer density\nand viscosity as reference quantities. The velocity is nondimensionalized on\nthe integral mean value, U, of the undisturbed velocity across both layers in\norder to keep the formulation identical with that of Blennerhassett (1980).\nThe coordinates are nondimensionalized on the air layer thickness L, with the\norigin at the undisturbed interface. For the majority of this study the base water\nlayer is assumed to have the same thickness as the layer of undisturbed air.\nThe media properties are given in table 1. Surface tension coefficient, S, was\ntaken to be 0.0735 N mK1 to allow comparison with Blennerhassett (1980).\nThe flow is laminar and entirely two-dimensional.\nSubscripts \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018l\u2019 are used to denote air and liquid, respectively. Ratios of\nviscosity coefficients and densities are defined as mZml\/ma and rZrl\/ra,\ncorrespondingly.\nDouble subscripts denote dimensionless ratios of the corresponding values in\nthe two layers, for example, the ratio of the viscosity coefficients is denoted as\nmlaZml\/ma. Superscript \u2018o\u2019 is used for the base flow solution.\nThe horizontal velocity component in the base flow can be taken in the form\nuoa \u00bc \u00f01\u00fe bay \u00fe aay2\u00de\n1\nd\n; 0%y%1;\nuol \u00bc \u00f01\u00fe bly \u00fe aly2\u00de\n1\nd\n; K1%y%0;\n9>=\n>; (2.1)Proc.

To build the\ndispersion relation we use the algorithm described applied by Thomas (1953) and\nBlennerhassett (1980). Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting is performed\n(taking into account the matrix structure both in storage and algorithm) in order\nto bring the system matrix to the block-triangular form so that in the matrix of\nthe linear system, ai,i is the only non-zero element in the ith row and ith column.\nHence, for the system to have a non-zero solution, ai,i must be equal to zero.\nTherefore, we can regard ai,i as a function of (k, Re, c) and apply an iterative\nmethod (we used a modified Newton\u2013Raffson method with regularization\nmultiplier described, for example, in Kogan et al. (2000) to find roots of ai,i(c)\nZ0 for given (k, Re). The code built based on the proposed scheme was tested\nagainst results published by Orzag (1971), Blennerhassett (1980) and Yiantsios &\nHiggins (1988) and demonstrated good accuracy and convergence characteristics.\nIn our opinion, the benefits of compact differencing combined with the generally\navailable computational power practically eliminate the need for alternative\n(e.g. spectral) methods in multi-layer stability calculations. A detailed descrip-\ntion of the scheme derivation and numerical tests can be found in the Ph.D. thesis\nby Shapiro (2004).4. Results\nInterfacial instability gives rise to the broadband neutral curve shown in figure 1a.\nOur results for this neutral curve are in good agreement with the numerical and\nasymptotic results presented in Blennerhassett (1980). However, as wasmentioned\nin the introduction, the second neutral curve shown in fig. 2 of Blennerhassett\n(1980) and again in our figure 1a, is in fact a closed loop which does not belong toProc. R.

In order to understand the events\nleading to the formation of the neutral loop, we consider the real and imaginary\nparts of the phase speed, cr(k) and ci(k) respectively, as a function of the\nwavenumber for a fixed Reynolds number in the flow. An example is shown in\nfigure 2 for ReZ10 000, which corresponds to the middle part of the loop.\nAs follows from figure 2, the loop is formed by two different modes, with the\nregion inside the loop corresponding to stable disturbances. Later, we will show\nthat the modes involved can be connected with the interfacial instability (I-mode)\nand Tollmien\u2013Schlichting instability in air (TSA-mode), as labelled in the\ndiagram.However, one should bear inmind that themode identification is amatter\nof some subtlety, in this case because, in fact, the I-mode in figure 2 is connected to\nthe lower branch of the broadband neutral curve whereas the TSA-mode is\nobtained by continuation from the upper branch of the broadband neutral curve. In\nthis case, to be able to trace mode behaviour in a consistent manner, we have\nchosen to identify I and TSA modes by their longwave behaviour.\nAt lower Reynolds numbers the interfacial waves neutral curve is formed by\none mode (figure 3); therefore the mode structure shown in figure 2 has no direct\ncontinuation into lower Reynolds numbers.\nLet us consider the variation of the two modes with the Reynolds number in\nmore detail. To this end, the values of the phase speed, c, for the two modesProc. R. Soc. A (2005)\nFigure 5. First branch exchange. (a) Im(c); (b) Re(c).\nFigure 6. Second branch exchange.

As the\nReynolds number increases, the distance between the mode curves in (k, Re)\nparameter plane decreases. The imaginary part of the phase speed for the I-mode\ndevelops a local minimum, which at Rex8642 gives rise to a narrow range of\nstable waves with ci!0, hence indicating the beginning of the stable loop\n(figure 4a). At the same time, the imaginary part of the phase speed for the TSA-\nmode develops a spike nearly touching the neutral level with ciZ0 (figure 4b).\nFor the Reynolds numbers in figure 4, the I-mode alone is responsible for the\nbroadband interfacial instability (for both short and long waves) and for the\nneutral point of the loop and a range of stable waves inside the loop.\nAt the Reynolds number ReZ9800 (ca), the I-mode and TSA mode intersect\nand exchange branches as shown in figure 5. Now the loop is formed by two\ndifferent modes (as in figure 2 earlier) with the mode identity essentially lost.\nA branch of the previously distinct TSA-mode is now connected with the\ninterfacial I-mode for longer waves, the other branch of the TSA-mode is\nconnected to the short-wave I-mode.Proc.

Neutral stability curves for all modes.\nE. Shapiro and S. Timoshin1592At still higher Reynolds numbers, the distance between the modes first\nincreases, but then it begins to decrease. The TSA-mode develops a local\nmaximum in ci and the modes exchange branches once again between ReZ12 400\nand ReZ12 450 (see figure 6). After the second mode crossing, the mode\nconfiguration returns to the same arrangement as before mode intersection, with\nboth the loop and the broadband neutral curve formed by the I-mode alone.\nAt still higher Reynolds numbers, the local range of stable waves of the I-mode\nnarrows down and eventually vanishes at approximately ReZ20 553. This point\nmarks the closure of the loop.\nThe two intersections between the I-mode and TSA-modes described above\ntake place at points representing stable waves. Before the first and immediately\nafter the second mode crossing, i.e. at Re!9600 and ReT12 450, the TSA-mode\nis stable. However, at somewhat higher Reynolds numbers, starting from\napproximately ReZ13 767, the TSA mode becomes unstable and forms its own\nneutral curve as can be seen in figure 7.Proc. R. Soc.

At higher Reynolds\nnumbers, this root leads to instability associated with a Tollmien\u2013Schlichting\nmechanism acting in the liquid layer (water) or TSL-mode, for short. According\nto our computations this mode is well separated from the other two modes.\nThe overall patterns of the neutral curves for the three modes described above\nare shown in figure 8. The critical conditions are summarized in the table 2.\nAt still higher Reynolds numbers, intersections between the I-mode and TSA-\nmode reappear again, however, accurate computations for these events become\nvery demanding, hence only a brief summary of our results will be presented\nhere. Just before the next mode crossing, the ci(k) distribution for the I-mode\nagain develops a local minimum that produces a stable region starting from\napproximately ReZ50 450, while the TSA-mode neutral curve is shifted towards\nlower wave numbers (figure 9). The mode crossing itself occurs between\nReZ83 000 and ReZ83 400 (figure 10). Afterwards, the local minimum in the\ngraph of ci(k) disappears and the modes become well separated.\nIn our description above, we assigned the TSA and TSL abbreviation to two\ndistinct modes with reference to Tollmien\u2013Schlichting instability mechanisms\noperational in air and in water separately. We see that in our case the Tollmien\u2013\nSchlichting instability mechanism appears in distinct forms in the two media.\nThis can probably be attributed to the large viscosity and density ratios for the\ntwo fluids involved. Nevertheless, a number of indirect observations and further\nparametric studies allow the modes to be linked with a particular physical\nmechanism. Consider, for example, the phase speed of neutral TSA and TSL\nwaves. In our computations above, the base flow speed at the interface is\nua\no(0)Z0.3076.

Timoshin1594unstable TSL-waves is lower than that at the interface and it tends to zero as\nRe\/N, whereas the phase speed for unstable I-waves and TSA-waves exceeds\nthe flow speed at the interface which is in agreement with results reported by\nSangalli et al. (1997).\nAn alternative argument helping to identify the two Tollmien\u2013Schlichting\nmodes can be based on the variation of the relative thickness of the liquid layer.\nConsider the case of decreasing water layer thickness. In the limit of a thin water\nfilm, the velocity distribution in the base channel flow approaches a parabolic\nPoiseuille flow profile in air and a Couette flow linear profile in water. In this\nlimit, the TSA mode should turn into the standard Tollmien\u2013Schlichting\ninstability in a channel filled with air. At the same time, since the Couette flow is\nstable to linear perturbations, one could expect some form of degeneration for the\nTSL-mode. In order to illustrate these considerations, we performed a set of\ncomputations for a fixed thickness of the air layer and a variable relative\nthickness of the liquid layer denoted as n (in the computations above, nZ1).\nThe base flow profile specified in \u00a72 was altered accordingly. As expected, with\nthe water layer thickness decreasing, the neutral curve for the TSA-mode\napproaches the neutral curve of the Tollmien\u2013Schlichting mode in a single fluid\ncase. This is illustrated in figure 11a for the neutral curves and in figure 12 for the\ncritical parameters. For the results shown in figure 11a, the Reynolds numberProc. R. Soc.

For these computations the Reynolds number and wavenumber\nwere renormalized by taking the half-width of the water layer as a characteristic\nlength and mean velocity by profile for nZ1 in both layers. The critical Reynolds\nnumber for this mode increases and tends to infinity for a film of vanishing\nthickness.5. Discussion\nThe flow configuration considered in this paper is a classical test bed for the\nstability theory of layered flows. The complicated pattern of the stability\ndiagram described above came as a surprise to us. One might question the\npractical relevance of the linear stability results at Reynolds numbers above\nthe first critical value where the most interesting events seem to be taking place\nin our work. We believe, however, that many features discovered in our\ncomputations are transferable to other, more realistic, regimes for flows in\ndifferent geometries or with different combinations of fluids, with even more\ncomplex forms of mode interactions to be expected in flows with three or more\ndistinct layers. In all such cases a clear understanding of the physical\nmechanisms behind observed or predicted instability is important. Not less\nimportant is a realization of the fact that the physics of instability in layered\nflows can easily be obscured by the mode crossing phenomena.\nBased on the results obtained, we arrive at the following picture of the linear\nstability in this case. The TSL-mode was clearly identified as Tollmien\u2013\nSchlichting mode by its asymptotic behaviour as Re\/N, wave speed on the\nneutral curve tends to zero (checked to Rew106). The wavespeed on the neutral\ncurve also tends to zero and is always lower than the interface speed O(10K2).\nI-Mode can be definitely attributed to the surface waves following the analysis of\nBlennerhassett (1980). Calculations made for the point of intersection between\nthe lower branch of the neutral curve and the Re axis were in good comparisonProc. R. Soc. A (2005)\nE. Shapiro and S. Timoshin1596with the results from the asymptotics of Blennerhassett (1980). The nature of the\nTSA-mode is clear from its asymptotic behaviour as water film thickness tends to\nzero. Therefore, the TSA-mode can be clearly attributed to the shear mode in air\nand TSL-mode\u2014to the liquid shear mode.\nThe wavespeed of the neutrally stable solutions for Tollmien\u2013Schlichting mode\nin air is faster than the velocity of the free boundary and this mode interacts with\nsurfacewaves.Thewavespeed of neutrally stable solutions forTollmien\u2013Schlichting\nmode in water is lower than the speed of the interface. That mode does not interact\nwith two other modes and produces a neutral curve typical for Poiseuille\u2013Couette\nflows (see, for example, Cowley & Smith 1985).\nThe interaction between the gas shear mode and interfacial mode occurs for\nthe wavenumbers k2[1, 2], which corresponds to wavelengths of the order of the\nchannel height. The minimum initially developed by the ci(k) for the interfacial\nmode is located approximately at the same k as the maxima of the stable gas\nshear mode. Also, the wave speeds of the interfacial mode and shear mode are\nclose enough in the domain of interaction in k. It is possible that what we observe\nis in fact energy transfer from the interfacial waves to the gas shear mode, which\ntakes place for the disturbances of O(1) wavelengths. This leads to the excitation\nof the stable gas shear mode and stabilization of the unstable interfacial\nmode. Apparently, the conditions that allow for this energy transfer to take\nplace can be periodical in Re as the interaction and branch exchange is repeated\nat higher Reynolds numbers. Therefore, it is possible that the stabilization\nof the interfacial waves can be attributed to the energy transfer between\ninterfacial and shear mechanisms of instability and energy transfer across the\nspectrum of the interfacial waves, rather than the interaction between different\nparts of the interfacial instability spectrum alone.\nAnother example of the observed interaction between gas shear and interfacial\nmodes can be found in the results obtained by Timoshin & Hooper (2000), who\nhave shown that Tollmien\u2013Schlichting mode and interfacial waves mode can\nhave points of coalescence. The results presented in our paper extend these\nobservations to the case of channel flows. We can also note that the effect of\ninterfacial wave stabilization and interaction between interfacial and gas shear\nmodes has been observed by different authors for a wide variety of problems,\nwhich suggests that it possesses certain structural stability.\nThe authors are grateful to Professor B. J. Boersma for pointing out the significance of the velocity\nprofile curvature at the interface.
