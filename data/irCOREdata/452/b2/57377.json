The Salt Range and the Trans-Indus ranges of Pakistan are regarded as 32 \nimportant reference areas for Permian strata; however despite considerable research in the 33 \narea, few studies have dealt with biostratigraphy (e.g. Pakistani-Japanese Research 34 \nGroup, 1985; Wardlaw and Pogue, 1995; Mertmann, 1999). Most studies have 35 \nconcentrated on taxonomy of various groups, and Permian-Triassic boundary problems 36 \n(e.g. see  Waagen, 1882-1885; Noetling, 1901; Diener, 1912; Grabau, 1931; Balme, 37 \n1970; Kummel and Teichert, 1970; Rowell, 1970; Grant, 1970; Glenister and Furnish, 38 \n1970; Kummel, 1970; Sohn, 1970; Sweet, 1970; Sarjeant, 1970). 39 \nThe Permian succession is divided into two groups (Fig. 2), representing two different 40 \ndepositional settings: the largely terrestrial Gondwana succession, represented by the 41 \nNilwahan Group, and the shallow marine Tethyan succession, represented by the 42 \noverlying Zaluch Group (Wardlaw and Pogue, 1995). The base of the Nilawahan Group 43 \nis characterized by the Tobra Formation, showing glacially-influenced sedimentation 44 \n 3 \n(Ghauri et al., 1977). It is overlain by the Dandot Formation, in the Salt Range. But this 45 \nformation is absent in the Khisor Range and western Salt Range. The Dandot Formation 46 \nconsists of pale grey to olive green sandstone having occasionally scattered pebbles of up 47 \nto 10 cm in diameter or pebbly beds with subordinate dark grey and greenish splintery 48 \nshales (Shah, 1977) and containing the bivalve Eurydesma and the conularid, Conularia 49 \n(Reed, 1936; Pascoe, 1959). Many species of Bryozoa and Ostracoda along with a few 50 \nbrachiopod taxa have also been described from the formation..  51 \nArid conditions are indicated by the succeeding Warchha Formation, which consists of 52 \nmedium- to coarse-grained, purple, arkosic sandstone, conglomeratic in places with 53 \ninterbeds of reddish shale. The conglomerate clasts are mostly granitic in nature, though 54 \nquartzitic clasts are also present.  55 \nMore humid conditions are indicated by the overlying Sardhai Formation (Sultan, 2004). 56 \nThe name Sardhai Formation, as approved by the Stratigraphic Committee of Pakistan, 57 \ncomes from Gee (written comm. 1964). Prior to which, Gee (in Pascoe, 1959) called it 58 \n\u201cLavender clay stage\u201d. Earlier, Wynne (1878) called it \u201cLavender clay\u201d whereas Noetling 59 \n(1901) called the formation \u201cupper part of Warchha Group\u201d (Shah, 1977). The type 60 \nlocality of the formation has been suggested by Gee, as the Sardhai Gorge in the eastern 61 \nSalt Range (Shah, 1977). The formation is composed of bluish to greenish-grey claystone 62 \nwith subordinate sandstone and siltstone interbeds. It is also reported to contain minor 63 \ncarbonaceous clays. These clays are lavender in colour and contain copper minerals, as 64 \nwell as jarosite, chert and gypsum (Shah, 1977). Shah (1977) observed lateral facies 65 \nchanges from the lavender- coloured clays in the Salt Range to black shale and brownish 66 \nargillaceous limestone in the Khisor Range. Generally the formation is reported to be 67 \n 4 \nunfossiliferous with occasional plant remains in the exposures in the Salt Range (Shah, 68 \n1977); however well-developed limestone interbeds from the Khisor Range, have been 69 \nreported by Shah (1977) to have yielded determinable brachiopods and bryozoans. 70 \nHussain (1967) reported the fossils, Anastomopora sp., Fenestella sp., Athyris sp., 71 \nSpirifer sp. from the sandy limestone beds exposed at the Saiyiduwali in the Khisor 72 \nRange and assigned an Early Permian age to the formation (Alam, 2008). Moreover a 73 \nunit recognized as Sardhai from the Jang drill core (Fig. 1; Alam et al., 1987), following 74 \nWardlaw and Pogue (1995) contained common fish debris. One of the samples also 75 \nyielded common paleoniscoid fish teeth and a single Hindeodus conodont, the presence 76 \nof which by Wardlaw and Pogue (1995) has been attributed to the deposition of the 77 \nformation in a very shallow marine settings. Variable thicknesses of the formation have 78 \nbeen observed in eastern and western Salt Range and Trans-Indus Khisor Range. At the 79 \ntype locality i.e Sardhai Gorge, it is reported to be 42m thick, in the western Salt Range, 80 \nit is 65m thick, whereas in the Khisor Range, it makes up 50m (Shah, 1977). Its lower 81 \ncontact with the Warchha Formation has been assigned as transitional, whereas the upper 82 \ncontact, following Shah (1977) is conformable with the overlying Amb Formation. 83 \nWardlaw and Pogue (1995) have mentioned the presence of the significant hiatus 84 \nbetween the Nilawahan and Zaluch Group. Based on the presence of the conodont in the 85 \nupper part of the Nilawhan Group (Sardhai Formation) Wardlaw and Pogue (1995) 86 \nsuggested the climatic amelioration from the significantly cold, non- existent conodont 87 \nglacial waters to cool, conodont-bearing waters. The Nilwahan Group, indicates marginal 88 \nmarine fluvial deposition, that was glacially controlled, especially in the Tobra and 89 \nDandot formations, thus reflecting the combined effects of the overall Permian climatic 90 \n 5 \namelioration, i.e. the southward expansion of the warmer climatic zones and the 91 \nnorthward continental movement into the milder climatic zones (Wardlaw and Pogue, 92 \n1995).  93 \nThe overlying Zaluch Group is a well-exposed succession of the shallow marine to inter-94 \ntidal carbonate facies of the Amb, Wargal and Chhidru formations (Fig. 2), that were 95 \ndeposited when a large carbonate platform developed on the Gondwana continental crust 96 \nclose to the Indian Shield (Mertmann, 2003). The contrast between the largely cool 97 \nclimate continental \u201cGondwanan\u201d deposits of the Nilawahan Group and the richly 98 \nfossiliferous, marine \u201cTethyan\u201d deposits of the Zaluch Group appears great, showing 99 \ngradual change from the marginally glacial sedimentation to marginally warm water 100 \ndeposition (Wardlaw and Pogue, 1995).        101 \nThus the Permian succession of Pakistan provides information on the changing 102 \npalaeoclimate and palaeogeography of the region, comprising a record of warming as the 103 \nCarboniferous-Permian glaciations waned and northern Gondwana drifted northwards 104 \n(Stephenson et al., 2007; 2008).  105 \nBiostratigraphical dating has suggested a range of ages for Salt Range units. The 106 \nbrachiopods of the Amb Formation were considered by Waterhouse (1976; 1981) to be 107 \nLate Baigendzinian (upper Artinskian). The fusulinid fauna from the formation was also 108 \nassigned as Baigendzinian by the Pakistani-Japanese Research Group (1985). Pollen and 109 \nspores investigated by Balme (1970), suggested an Artinskian age. The most recent age 110 \ndetermination is that of Wardlaw and Pogue (1995), who used conodonts, which indicate 111 \na Wordian (middle Guadalupian, Kazanian) age.  112 \n 6 \nThe Pakistani-Japanese Research Group (1985) reported a number of megafossils from 113 \nthe Wargal Formation, including commonly occurring brachiopods. Gastropods and 114 \ncorals have also been reported, along with common occurrences of small foraminifera 115 \nthroughout the formation. The fusulinids and foraminifers indicate a late Murghabian, 116 \nTethyan equivalent of Capitanian, through early Dzhulfian, Tethyan equivalent of 117 \nWuchiapingian. The brachiopods indicate an early Dzhulfian (Wuchiapingian) age 118 \n(Pakistani-Japanese Research Group, 1985). The conodonts have been assigned to 119 \nCapitanian through Wuchiapingian age by Wardlaw and Pogue (1995). The overlaying 120 \nChhidru Formation is reported to include small foraminifera, along with brachiopods, 121 \nmolluscan fossils, Bryozoa and rare ammonoids (Cycolobus). The conodonts are 122 \ncommonly dominated by the near-shore Hindeodus (Wardlaw and Pogue, 1995). The 123 \nforaminifers from the formation support correlation with the Wachiaping Formation of 124 \nSouth China and thus it has been assigned to the late Dzhulfian (Wuchiapingian) by the 125 \nPakistani-Japanese Research Group (1985).  126 \nPalynological study of the Permian succession is confined to the Salt Range; there are no 127 \nreports of palynology from the Trans-Indus ranges. Virkki (1946) and Venkatachala and 128 \nKar (1966, 1968) studied samples from a horizon 20-25 feet above the Tobra Formation 129 \n(see Balme, 1970).  Balme (in Teichert, 1967) also described assemblages from the Tobra 130 \nFormation at Zaluch Nala, eastern Salt Range and assigned them to the Permian 131 \n(Teichert, 1967). Kemp (1975) examined two samples from the Tobra Formation at 132 \nZaluch Nala and reported the presence of Brevitriletes sp. cf. B. unicus, Lophotriletes sp. 133 \ncf. L. scotinus, Horriditriletes- Lophotriletes sp. Potonieisporites neglectus, 134 \nDentatisporites sp. along with acritarchs, referable to the genus Cymatiosphaera, while 135 \n 7 \nKhan et al., (2001) reported Tobra Formation assemblages from Nilawahan Gorge, 136 \ncentral Salt Range. 137 \nThere is no palynological work on the Sardhai formation, but Balme (1970) made a 138 \ndetailed taxonomic survey of the carbonate dominated succession of the overlying Amb, 139 \nWargal and Chhidru formations. He recovered pollen and spores from the plant-bearing 140 \nhorizons of the Amb Formation at three localities in the Salt Range: Zaluch Nala, Dhodha 141 \nWahan, and near Warchha Water Tank. Trilete spores represented were: Acanthotriletes 142 \ntereteangulatus, Camptotriletes warchianus, Leiotriletes cf. adnatus, Lophotriletes 143 \nnovicus and Verrucosisporites sp. cf. V. planiverrucatus, while Reticuloidosporites 144 \nwarchianus was the only monolete spore taxon. The monosaccate pollen included 145 \nPlicatipollenites indicus and Potonieisporites novicus. Balme (1970) reported a high 146 \ndiversity of bisaccate pollen including the taeniate taxa Corisaccites alutas, 147 \nGuttulapollenites hannonicus, Hamiapollenites insolitus, Lueckisporites singhii, 148 \nProtohaploxypinus limpidus, P. goraiensis, P. diagonalis, P.varius, Striatopodocarpites 149 \ncancellatus, S. rarus and S. pantii,. Non-taeniate bisaccate taxa included Alisporites 150 \ntenuicorpus, Falcisporites nuthallensis, Pinuspollenites thoracatus, Sulcatisporites 151 \novatus, S. nilssoni and Vitreisporites pallidus. Balme (1970) noticed similarities between 152 \nthe palynological assemblages from the Zaluch Group of Pakistan with those of the 153 \nMadagascar, Australia and the then USSR. 154 \nFor the present study, two samples (Figs. 3 and 4) were collected from a 22 meter-thick 155 \nexposure of the Sardhai Formation in the Khisor Range at N32\no\n 11\n\/\/\n 52.1\n\/\n E 70\no\n 59\n\/\/\n 18.0\n\/\n. 156 \nOne more sample, 25 meters above base of the Sardhai Formation was collected from an 157 \n 8 \napproximately 30 meter-thick exposure of the same formation at Zaluch Nala, Salt Range 158 \nat N32\no\n 46\n\/\/\n 58.4\n\/ \nE 71\no\n 38\n\/\/\n 49.4\n\/\n. 159 \nAssuming that the Salt and Khisor ranges comprise a potential Permian reference section 160 \nfor the South Tethys, because of their good outcrop exposures, palyniferous lithologies 161 \nand the presence of abundant marine fauna for age calibration, yet the aim of this paper is 162 \nto only document and describe the assemblages of the Sardhai Formation and to correlate 163 \nthem with the other reported assemblages from the southern Tethyan region including the 164 \nstandard palynostratigraphic scheme of Arabia. Our long term intention would be to 165 \ndevelop such palynological succession and studies on the Tobra, Dandot and Warchha 166 \nformations.    167 \n 168 \nMaterials and methods 169 \nThe preparation of strew mounts for palynological analysis involved established 170 \nprocedures of crushing followed by hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid treatments (Wood 171 \net al., 1996). Post-hydrofluoric acid organic residues were oxidized with Schulze\u2019s 172 \nSolution and dilute nitric acid. The photography was done with a DP11 Olympus digital 173 \ncamera mounted on a Zeiss Universal microscope. The samples collected and 174 \npalynological slides prepared are housed at the laboratories of the British Geological 175 \nSurvey, UK. 176 \n 177 \nDescription of assemblages 178 \n 9 \nThe yield of the samples was mainly poor, however it was possible in most cases to count 179 \nat least two hundred specimens per slide. Thirty five taxa were identified from these 180 \nsamples, including the palynostratigraphically important Camptotriletes warchianus, 181 \nFlorinites ?balmei and Lueckisporites virkkiae. A list of all palynomorph species with 182 \nauthor citation is given in Appendix 2 and selected taxa are displayed in Plates I and II. 183 \nThe quantitative character of assemblages from the Sardhai Formation at Zaluch Nala and 184 \nKhisor Range is shown in Tables 1 and 2.  185 \nCorrelation with Arabia 186 \nThe most extensively studied Tethyan Permian sections are those of Oman and Saudi 187 \nArabia (Stephenson and Filatoff, 2000a,b; Stephenson, 2008). Stephenson et al., (2003) 188 \nand Stephenson (2006) established eight palynological biozones (OSPZ 1 to OSPZ6); and 189 \nOSPZ5 and OSPZ6 are considered Mid- and Late Permian in age. OSPZ5, associated 190 \nwith the lower to middle parts of the Upper Gharif member in Oman, is dominated by 191 \ndistally-taeniate bisaccate pollen including  Distriatites insolitus and Hamiapollenites 192 \ndettmannae, but also contains Densiopollenites indicus, Platysaccus cf. queenslandi, 193 \nPlayfordiaspora cancellosa and Thymospora opaqua. 194 \nThe base of the succeeding biozone, OSPZ6, represents a considerable palynological 195 \nchange because a number of taxa appear for the first time at this level, and because 196 \ndiversity increases. The base of OSPZ6 is defined by the first occurrence of Florinites 197 \n?balmei which is usually very common. Other taxa of OSPZ6 include Camptotriletes 198 \nwarchianus, Pyramidosporites cyathodes and Protohaploxypinus uttingii though many 199 \ntaxa such as Alisporites nuthallensis, Laevigatosporites callosus, Lueckisporites virkkiae, 200 \n 10 \nThymospora opaqua and Reduviasporonites chalastus persist from OSPZ5 (Stephenson 201 \net al., 2003; Stephenson, 2006, 2008). 202 \nThe base of OSPZ6 occurs in the highest parts of the Upper Gharif member in Oman a 203 \nfew meters below the base of the succeeding carbonate Khuff Formation in beds 204 \nsometimes referred to as the Khuff Transition beds (see Stephenson, 2006, 2008) and the 205 \nbiozone extends into the Khuff Formation. In central Saudi Arabia, assemblages assigned 206 \nto OSPZ6 (i.e. containing Florinites ?balmei) also occur in clastic sedimentary rocks 207 \nbelow the base of the Khuff Formation. 208 \nThe lower age limit of OSPZ6 is difficult to constrain since no independent 209 \npalaeontological data are available from the clastic sedimentary rocks of the Upper 210 \nGharif member. In Oman the base of OSPZ6 occurs consistently a few metres below the 211 \nbase of the carbonate Khuff Formation (see Stephenson, 2006, 2008) and the lower beds 212 \nof the Khuff Formation are dated as early Wordian in age (Angiolini et al., 2003). Since 213 \nno significant hiatus is present between the Upper Gharif member and the lower Khuff 214 \nFormation the lower limit of the age of OSPZ6 is likely to be Wordian. The upper age 215 \nlimit of OSPZ6 in Oman and Saudi Arabia is yet to be defined but the assemblages that 216 \ncharacterise it are not known to extend into the Triassic.  217 \nThe presence in the Sardhai Formation of Florinites ?balmei in addition to Alisporites 218 \nnuthallensis, Corisaccites alutas, Camptotriletes warchianus, Laevigatosporites callosus 219 \nand Thymospora opaqua suggests a correlation with the OSPZ6 Biozone of Arabia. The 220 \nAmb Formation above the Sardhai Formation is similar palaeontologically and 221 \nlithologically to the Arabian Khuff Formation and is widely considered to be its temporal 222 \n 11 \nand sedimentological equivalent (see Angiolini and Bucher, 1999) having been formed 223 \nby essentially the same marine transgression associated with neo-Tethyan sea floor 224 \nspreading (Angiolini et al., 2003; Mertmann, 2003). The evidence thus suggests that the 225 \nSardhai Formation correlates with the immediate pre-carbonate clastic sedimentary rocks 226 \nof Arabia, including the basal Khuff clastics and the Khuff transition beds. In the light of 227 \nthis correlation, a Wordian age is tentatively suggested for the Sardhai Formation. 228 \n 229 \nTethyan correlation 230 \nRecently Stolle (pers. comm) investigated the Permian Kas and Gomaniibrik formations 231 \nin southeast Turkey. The Kas Formation has been dated as Wordian by foraminifera 232 \n(Stolle, pers. comm.) The assemblages in the Kas Formation are dominated by spores, 233 \nparticularly monolete taxa, including Punctatisporites spp., Spinosporites sp., Torispora 234 \nspp., and Thymospora opaqua, but also contain common Camptotriletes warchianus, 235 \nDistriatites insolitus, Florinites ?balmei (up to 23% of assemblages) and Hamiapollenites 236 \ndettmannae. Stolle (pers. comm.) correlated the Kas Formation assemblages with OSPZ6, 237 \nand noted similarities with northern Iraqi subsurface assemblages described by Nader et 238 \nal., (1993) and Singh (1964). Stolle\u2019s figure 5 illustrates a correlation of OSPZ6 239 \nassemblages across the Tethyan region, including Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Oman 240 \nand this chart is here modified to include the Salt and Khisor ranges Sardhai Formation 241 \nOSPZ6 assemblages (Fig. 5).  242 \n 243 \n 12 \nPalaegeographic distribution of Florinites ?balmei 244 \nThis correlation shows that the distinctive pollen Florinites ?balmei is present in 245 \napproximately coeval rocks in an area of the southern Neotethys which is now 246 \nrepresented by southeast Turkey and northern Iraq. In addition Florinites ?balmei has 247 \nrecently been described from the basal Khuff clastics in Kuwait (Tanoli et al., 2008) and 248 \nis known to occur in the same unit in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar (BGS 249 \nunpublished reports; Fig. 6). Its occurrence in the Salt and Khisor ranges and apparent 250 \nabsence from Middle Permian rocks elsewhere in Gondwana, Euramerica and Cathaysia 251 \nsuggests that the plant that produced Florinites ?balmei had a rather restricted 252 \npalaeogeographic distribution along the palaeotropical coast of the Tethys Ocean (Fig. 6). 253 \nIt also tends to support the palaeogeographic reconstructions of Ricou in Dercourt et al., 254 \n(1993), Ziegler et al., (1998) and Gaetani et al., (2000) showing the Salt Range area in 255 \ncontiguity with the southern part of the Arabian Plate. 256 \nThe complex palaeogeography and palaeotectonics of the Tethyan margin from the Early 257 \nto Mid Permian has been discussed by amongst others Seng\u00f6r (1979), Ricou (in Dercourt 258 \net al., 1993), Ziegler et al., (1998), Gaetani et al., (2000) and Angiolini (2001). 259 \nAngiolini\u2019s (2001) reconstruction of the Wordian shows the Mega Lhasa Block or 260 \nCimmerian blocks (comprising Iran, Afghanistan, Karakorum and Sibumasu, Thailand) 261 \nin contiguity and in relative proximity to the Gondwanan margin, however the form and 262 \nposition of the Mega Lhasa Block is generally considered uncertain  263 \n 13 \n(Gaetani, 1997; Muttoni et al., personal communication), thus further work to establish 264 \nwhether Florinites ?balmei occurs in the Mega Lhasa Block; especially Thailand might 265 \nshed more light on such reconstructions. 266 \nThe well known Oman Gharif palaeoflora (e.g. Broutin et al., 1995; Berthelin et al., 267 \n2003) was described from the uppermost Gharif Formation in the Huqf area in interior 268 \nOman, and is believed to consist of a mixture of Gondwanan, Cathaysian and 269 \nEuramerican fossil plant taxa. Plant taxa of the Permian Cathaysian Paleokingdom 270 \npresent in Oman were considered by Berthelin et al., (2003) to indicate a close 271 \nrelationship between the Neotethys realm and south China. Further work should aim to 272 \nestablish whether Florinites ?balmei occurs in the Cathaysian Paleokingdom. 273 \n 274 \nConclusion 275 \nThe presence of Florinites ?balmei together with other stratigtraphically important taxa, 276 \ne.g. Camptotriletes warchianus, suggest that the Sardhai Formation correlates with the 277 \nKhuff transition beds of Oman and the basal Khuff clastics of central Saudi Arabia and 278 \ncan be likewise assigned to the Arabian OSPZ6 biozone, indicating a tentative Wordian 279 \nage. Overall the Salt Range Permian succession is also similar in lithological character to 280 \nthat of the Arabian Peninsula: both have successions of glacial diamictites at the base, 281 \noverlain by the red beds, followed by distinctive dark shale-sandstone interbeds and 282 \nconclude with thick limestones.   283 \n 14 \nThis work has also shown that monosaccate pollen grain Florinites ?balmei had a limited 284 \npalaeogeographic distribution in the Mid-Permian across most of the southern Tethys and 285 \nArabia, whereas it is apparently not reported elsewhere in Gondwana and Euramerica. If 286 \nthis distribution can be more precisely delineated in regions in the wider Middle East and 287 \nparts of present day southeast Asia, it would help reconstruct this region\u2019s complex 288 \npalaeogeography and tectonics.  289 \n 290 \n 291 \n 292 \nAppendix 1 293 \nSystematic Palynology 294 \nFlorinites Schopf, Wilson and Bentall 1944 295 \nType Species: Florinites pellucidus (Wilson and Coe) Wilson, 1958. 296 \nFlorinites ?balmei Stephenson and Filatoff 2000  297 \nPlate I, figures 1-15. 298 \nFlorinites ?balmei Stephenson and Filatoff 2000: plate 2, figs j-m, p. 208-212 299 \nFlorinites millotti Butterworth and Williams 1954 \u2013 Nader et al., 1993: plate 13, figures 300 \n7-8 [no description]. 301 \n 15 \nFlorinites millotti Butterworth and Williams 1954 - Akyol, 1975: plate 9, figures 12-16 302 \n[no description]. 303 \nFlorinipollenites millotti (Butterworth and Williams) Coquel 1966 - Agrali and Akyol, 304 \n1967: plate 8, figures 21-24 [Florinipollenites Laveine 1965 is an obligate junior 305 \nsynonym of Florinites Schopf, Wilson and Bentall 1944]. 306 \nDescription: Pollen, monosaccate, bilaterally symmetrical; amb oval.
