We report and discuss the first neutron reflection measurements from the free\nsurfaces of normal and superfluid 4He and of a liquid 3He-4He mixture. In case of liquid 4He\nthe surface roughness is different above and below the lambda transition, being smoother in the\nsuperfluid state. For the superfluid, we also observe the formation of a surface layer \u223c 200 A\u02da thick\nwhich has a subtly different neutron scattering cross-section. The results can be interpreted as\nan enhancement of the Bose-Einstein condensate fraction close to the helium surface. We find\nthat the addition of 3He isotopic impurities leads to the formation of Andreev levels at low\ntemperatures.\n1. Introduction\nThe surface properties of quantum fluids have been the subject of intensive investigation over\nmany years [1, 2, 3, 4]. Interest in these systems lies both in the fundamental properties\nof quantum surfaces and also in the opportunity to use them as test media. For example,\nfundamental aspects of the theory of wave turbulence have already been tested experimentally\n[5]. This latter aspect is important because it is actually very difficult to obtain good\nexperimental results from observations of natural turbulent events, e.g. in the atmosphere,\nchannels, or streams. Furthermore, it is typically very difficult or impossible to control the\nexperimental parameters effectively. Hence there is a strong need for a model system where\nfundamental aspects of the theory can be tested through laboratory-scale experiments. Another\nimportant issue to be investigated is the surface ripplons, i.e. quantized gravity-capillary waves\non the free surface of the liquid, or at the interface between two superfluids [6]. There is a\nchance to obtain unique information about the superfluid Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and to\nmodel instabilities of the quantum vacuum beyond the event horizon and in the ergoregion\n(where the ripplon energy will be negative) of black holes [7]. Up to now, measurements of two-\ndimensional charge systems including surface electrons (SE) and layers of ions trapped under\nthe surface of liquid helium [8] have provided what is probably the most powerful experimental\ntechnique for studying the surface properties of liquid helium. The existence of the ripplons,\noriginally proposed by Atkins [9] in order to explain surface tension data, was clearly proven in\nexperiments on two-dimensional plasma resonances in SE [10], and under very well controlled\nconditions [11]. Later, ripplons were detected on liquid 3He [12] as well as the scattering of SE\nwith Fermi quasi-particles in bulk liquid [13]. Soon after that, it was found that the mobility of\n25th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics (LT25) IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 150 (2009) 032022 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/150\/3\/032022\nc\u00a9 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd 1\nFigure 1.

Right: The scattering potential profiles obtained by numerical simulation, using\nthe reflectivity data for 2.3K and 1.54K; the abscissa corresponds to vacuum below 0 A\u02da, to the\nnear-surface region between 0 and 800 A\u02da, and to bulk liquid 4He above 800 A\u02da\nSE on 3He deviates drastically from single-electron-ripplon scattering theory below 70mK [14].\nHowever, the SE system provides a rather indirect way of studying the liquid helium surface\nexperimentally, inevitably leading to ambiguities in the interpretation of the data.\nIn this paper we present the initial results of a new experimental method for studying ripplons\nand other surface properties, based on neutron scattering. It exploits the unique combination\nof small-angle neutron reflection from the liquid surface and an ultra-low temperature sample\nenvironment [15], thus opening up new opportunities for studying the interface properties of\nquantum liquids. We present our measurements of reflection from the superfluid and normal\nliquid 4He surfaces, and preliminary results from dilute 3He-4He mixtures.\n2. Experimental details\nOur experiments were performed on the CRISP Instrument at ISIS\/RAL, which was designed as\na general purpose reflectometer for the investigation of a wide spectrum of interfaces and surfaces.\nIt uses a broad-band neutron time-of-flight method for determination of the wavelength at fixed\nangles. Typical neutron wavelengths are in the range 0.5-6.5 A\u02da at the source frequency of 50\nHz. To provide the cryogenic sample environment we used a Variox BL cryostat, whose lowest\ntemperature of 1.25K was further reduced by use of a Heliox insert to cover the temperature\nrange 0.3-1.5K.\n3. Results obtained from pure 4He\nThe measured reflectivity of the liquid 4He surface as a function of Qz at temperatures of 2.3K\nand 1.54K is presented in Fig. 1 (left). Based on the Born approximation, the \u223c Q4z decrease\n25th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics (LT25) IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 150 (2009) 032022 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/150\/3\/032022\n2\nFigure 2. Reflectivity of a 3He\n(0.12%) 4He mixture measured at\nT = 0.37K (red) and T =\n1.7K(black). The inset shows\na height scan of the cryostat\nwith the instrument in transmission\ngeometry. The dip at 60.2 mm is\nthe location of the 3He surface.\nin the reflectivity curve indicates qualitatively that the surface is smooth. In order to obtain\nmore quantitative information from the data, we compare the reflectivity profile with an optical\nmodel. In its simplest form, the model reduces to the quantum mechanical problem of a particle\nincident on a potential step. In our case, the optical potential has three distinct regions: vacuum,\nnear surface, and bulk. The transitions between adjacent steps are calculated as interface\nroughness. The reflectivity is calculated from the optical potential using a recursive definition\nof the reflectivity, taking into account multiple reflections [16]. The numerical description of\nthe interface roughness follows that of Nevot and Croce [17]. From the experimental data we\nhave calculated the optical potential shown in Fig. 1 (right). It is clearly evident that, near to\nthe surface, there is a region with higher scattering power in the 1.54K data as compared with\nthose at 2.30K.\nAt 1.54K the transition from bulk to vacuum is compressed into \u223c400 A\u02da whereas, at 2.30K,\nthe transition occurs gradually over a larger 800 A\u02da distance. This behaviour may be attributable\nto the way in which Bose-Einstein condensation occurs in the liquid as it cools through the\nsuperfluid transition: an enhancement of Bose-Einstein condensate fraction close to the surface\nof the superfluid [15, 18, 19] could account the alteration in the neutron scattering structure\nfactor. Note that the optical potential is proportional to the density and scattering power of\nthe material.\n4. Neutron reflection from a 3He layer adsorbed on the liquid 4He surface\nThe measured reflectivity of a 3He-4He liquid surface is shown in Fig. 2 at a relatively high\ntemperature (1.75K) where a surface layer of 3He would not be expected, and at a lower\ntemperature (0.37K). We suggest that the difference in reflectivity at low Qz is attributable\nto Andreev states of the 3He on the surface at low temperatures.\nMore than four decades ago A. F. Andreev predicted theoretically the existence of quantum\nstates of 3He atoms on the free surface of liquid 4He [20]. In other words, at low temperatures,\n25th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics (LT25) IOP Publishing\nJournal of Physics: Conference Series 150 (2009) 032022 doi:10.1088\/1742-6596\/150\/3\/032022\n3\neven for extremely dilute solutions, a substantial number of 3He atoms are adsorbed at the\nsurface, forming a 2D Fermi liquid. The large difference in the neutron scattering cross section\nbetween the 3He and 4He isotopes, in combination with neutron reflection, is the only technique\nthat may be able to access the few hundred A\u02dalength scales required to observe this layer\nof 3He. The different reflectivities with and without 2D Fermi layer can thus be accounted\nfor. Experiments with different concentrations of 3He, and at different temperatures, are being\nplanned.\n5. Conclusions\nOur neutron reflection measurements from the surfaces of liquid 4He and a very dilute 3He-4He\nmixture show that the surface roughness is differs above and below the lambda transition, and\nthat the surface is smoother in the superfluid state. We observe the formation of a\u223c200 A\u02da surface\nlayer with a subtly different neutron scattering cross-section that may be attributable to an\nenhancement of the Bose-Einstein condensate fraction close to the helium surface. The addition\nof 0.12% of 3He brings about changes in reflectivity at low temperatures round 0.3K that would\nappear to be attributable to the occupation of Andreev levels.\nWe are extremely grateful to EPSRC and RAL\/ISIS for their support of the research.\nReferences\n[1] Osborne D V 1989 J.
