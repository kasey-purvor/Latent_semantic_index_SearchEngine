Widespread reforms to the welfare state, training and employment, \nbased upon a critique of welfare dependency, were implemented in Britain during a time of \nstructural changes in the economy and labour market, including high unemployment levels, \nindustrial decline and a rise in the service sector (Ashton, et al., 1989; Fergusson, 2002).  \nYouth employment opportunities were significantly affected, particularly for those with few \neducational qualifications (Allard, 1996) and youth training took on new meaning in 1988 \nwith the withdrawal of means-tested benefits for those under the age of 18 and the \ncompulsory registration of 16-17 year-olds on newly created Youth Training Schemes (YTS), \nunder the \u2018guarantee\u2019 of a place for all young people.  The structural inadequacy of the \nschemes, aimed at the supply side of the labour market without reciprocal employment \nopportunities, and the implications for young people have been well documented.  These \ninclude: the failure to provide a place for all; the variable quality of training not leading to \nemployment; lack of consideration of young people\u2019s circumstances; targeted funding leading \nto selective training; and the poor reputation of the schemes (Craig, 1991; Maclagan, 1992).  \nBy the mid 1990s, education and improving the qualifications of the workforce, was replacing \ntraining schemes as the positive alternative to youth employment (Allard, 1996). \n \nPolicies related to training programmes are dominated by discourses of individualisation and \nbased on a deficit model of the individual, where unemployment is located in an individual\u2019s \nlack of employability (Brine, 2002; Archer and Yamashita, 2003; Salisbury, 2004).  Such \nassumptions underpin New Labour\u2019s agenda to tackle social exclusion, disaffection and \ndisengagement.  Central to this agenda is reducing the number of young people not in \neducation, employment or training (commonly referred to as NEETs) (Department for \n 4 \nEducation and Employment, 1999b; Social Exclusion Unit, 1999; Department for Education \nand Skills, 2005).  This was given renewed focus in 2007 with a NEET strategy introduced to \nsharply reduce these numbers, which included extra measures for tracking and financial \nincentives to remain in learning, and a Public Service Agreement (PSA 14) to measure this \ntarget (Department of Children, Schools and Families, 2007a; 2007b; 2007c).  This aim is \nembedded within policies to transform the education system for 14-19 year-olds and to widen \npost-16 participation and develop a highly skilled workforce (DfES, 2002; 2005).  Emphasis \nis placed upon extended transition into further education or vocational training, with \ndiscourses of young people as \u2018learners\u2019 and a shift towards the Learner Society, and \nsuccessful transition related to economic independence (Ball, et al., 2000; Dean, 2003; \nAttwood, et al., 2004).  Under the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) the framework for post-\n16 learning encompassed reforms, including the \u2018Learning Gateway\u2019 and the Connexions \nService, to integrate support and advice for young people.  Provision would be coherent and \nresponsive to individual needs and address the implications of the long-term decline in \nunskilled and semi-skilled jobs for young people (DfEE, 1999a; DfES, 2002). [\n1\n]   \n \nThis approach has been criticised for failing to address the multi-dimensional aspects of \ninequality and disadvantage, such as disability, ethnicity and sexuality (Colley and \nHodkinson, 2001) with NEET status characterised as a mainly white (male) issue and a \nconsequence of de-industrialised working class communities (Britton, 2002).  Such discourses \ncould lead to further marginalisation for those with negative experiences of education, few \nqualifications (Attwood, et al., 2004) and learning difficulties (Hodgson, 2002) unless full \nconsideration is given the macroeconomic determinants of unemployment and the re-\nstructuring of the labour market.  Life chances can still largely be predicted by an individual\u2019s \nlocation within social structures (Furlong and Cartmel, 1997) and questions of labour market \nattachment cannot be addressed without acknowledging multiple issues intimately bound up \nwith family and social context that shape young people\u2019s lives (Dean, 2003).  Rather, young \npeople\u2019s agency is presented as the dominant factor in transition to the labour market with \n 5 \nmotivation to work masking broader social determinants (Furlong and Cartmel, 1997; Craig \nand Reiter, 2005). \n \nThis paper is concerned with the implementation of these policies and specifically, the way in \nwhich those engaging with young people are held accountable for their performance.  Central \nto current concepts of accountability is the notion that performance can be reported on, \ncompared and managed through indicators and targets (Salisbury, 2004).  For post-16 \nprovision this includes LSC achievement targets for the number of 19 year-olds qualified to at \nleast NVQ level 2 and participation targets for the number of 16-18 year-olds participating in \nlearning (GHK, 2004).  The Connexions Service has been charged with reducing the number \nof NEETs and the performance of training providers is measured on the numbers of young \npeople entering education, training or employment.  Performance thus equates to \nconformance with policy targets (Barrett, 2004).  Ranson (2003) argues that the \npreoccupation with specifying targets and measuring outcomes presents a quantifiable model \nof quality which distorts the practice of public services.  It has been identified that as a result \nof this context the main endeavour of front-line workers is to meet the output measures \n(Colley and Hodkinson, 2001; Lloyd and Payne, 2003).  In this sense, accountability for \nexternally defined objectives affects the way services are delivered (Barrett, 2004; Ranson, \n2003). \n \nExcluded from such accounts of services are any positive, non-quantifiable aspects of \ninterventions, in this context the detail of one-to-one attention from front-line workers \nassisting young people.  Nor do they acknowledge the significance of the wider context of \nyoung people\u2019s lives (Kushner, 2000).  This paper will seek to explore the actions of \u2018street-\nlevel\u2019 workers as they negotiate the demands of both externally imposed targets and those of \nthe young people they work with (Lipsky, 1980). \n \n \n 6 \n\u2018Life Skills\u2019 Programmes \n\u2018Life Skills\u2019 training programmes, part of a \u2018Learning Gateway\u2019, intended to re-engage young \npeople in further education, employment or training, through individually tailored support, in \nparticular those excluded from school, non-attendees, care leavers, teenage parents and young \noffenders (DfEE, 1999a).  Delivery was multi-agency with the Connexions Service, providing \nsupport through a Personal Adviser (PA), and local Learning and Skills Councils, developing \n\u2018Life Skills\u2019 training programmes to be delivered by training providers (DfEE, 1999a).[2] \nAttendance was not formally compulsory, however, because of limited post-16 provision \nthere were few alternatives for some young people.  Hence, young people with a range of \nlearning needs were directed towards programmes.   \n \nThe programmes were delivered for 16 hours a week, over three days and included three core \ncomponents: basic and key skills; vocational training; and personal and social development \n(DfEE, 1999a).  The latter component was presented as a positive aspect of the programmes \nbut was not recognised in reporting processes (Byshee and Hughes, 2002; GHK, 2004).  \nTimetables incorporated a range of sessions often developed around young people\u2019s interests, \nincluding basic skills, arts and crafts, IT, sport and independent living skills.  The \ncomplement of staff at a programme was a co-ordinator, a trainer and a support worker with \noccasional sessional staff.  Programme workers were from various professional backgrounds \nincluding teaching, healthcare, community and youth work.  Most had considerable \nexperience of working with young people but often stated that additional training, for \nexample in counselling, was needed.  Other professionals delivered specific sessions, such as \nbasic skills, health and safety and drug and alcohol education and some sessions were \ndelivered at a local college.  Programmes operated a \u2018roll-on, roll-off\u2019 cycle and young people \njoined and left at different points, initially registered for six months, though this could be \nextended.  The impact was measured by indicators of positive outcomes simply defined as \nyoung people entering education, employment or training.   \n \n 7 \nEthnographic Research \nThis study aimed to provide an informed understanding of some of the realities and tensions \nof practice.  It was apparent, from previous research, that front-line workers were frustrated \nwith the way in which, while supporting young people in difficult circumstances, they could \nnot define their work in terms of achieving prescribed outcomes.  Reliance upon such \nmeasures had significant limitations and in particular that developmental work with young \npeople, who might not count as a \u2018successful\u2019 outcome, was not recognised.  The programmes \nwere assessed without any reference to the variety of beneficiaries and the wider context of \ntheir lives, contexts that might do more to determine \u2018success\u2019 or \u2018failure\u2019 (Kushner, 2000). \n   \nFieldwork was undertaken with three training programmes in a Midlands city in England run \nby one training provider, selected after initial visits to seven programmes.  Claims of \nrepresentativeness are not made and this research did not aim to generalise, but rather to \nexplore the experiences of those involved and relate this to the broader social and policy \ncontext.  Fieldwork was conducted from September 2001 to September 2003, although \ninformal visits to programmes continued after this.  The research methods combined \nobservation, participant observation and participation in programmes one day each week as \nwell as directed data collection.  My presence at programmes and role as researcher was \nalways explicitly identified and reiterated when young people joined.  Participation involved \n\u2018being around\u2019 to develop familiarity with the formal and informal aspects of the \nprogrammes, assisting in training sessions, accompanying outings and short courses and a \nnumber of residential experiences.  Throughout the fieldwork a research diary was \nmaintained, summarising observations and key issues from each visit, and reviewed before \nsubsequent visits to ensure issues and developments were followed up with workers and \nyoung people.  This also provided a useful background to the directed data collection which \nfollowed. \n \n 8 \nThis consisted of focus groups and interviews with young people (n=42), and interviews with \nprogramme workers and Connexions PAs (n=8).  Focus groups were conducted first to \nintroduce young people to the directed data collection process, gauge their interest in \nparticipation in the interview stage and facilitate group discussion with their peers.  They \naimed to gain young people\u2019s views on the training programmes and their thoughts on their \nprogression.  Focus groups highlighted that, for a variety of reasons, some young people were \nnot confident and comfortable in this setting, their responses easily influenced by their peers.   \n \nFor the interview stage with young people, a participatory approach, including photography \nas a visual tool, was developed.  The aim was to conduct interviews at three points during \ntheir time on the programme to document progress and explore associated factors.  To assist \nwith this, disposable cameras were distributed and young people were asked to photograph \nthings of importance to them, both at the programme, including work placements, and outside \nthe programme, including social activities and home life.  The idea, based on previous \nresearch experiences, was to facilitate engagement in the research process, assist in discussing \nissues of personal relevance, including possible self-reflection, and to provide a lens to \nexplain some of the complexity and context of their lives.  Conducting the interviews at \nintervals allowed different sets of questions, about previous and current experiences, to be \nfollowed up in different interviews.  Young people volunteered to be involved and, while \nsome were eager to participate, not all young people wanted to take part.  Programme workers \nmade the final decision on the appropriateness of individuals\u2019 participation. \n \nThe research process was non-linear and had to be responsive and adaptable as young people \njoined and left programmes.  Opportunities to talk to young people were taken when available \nand the research process often mirrored the challenges faced by workers, including dealing \nwith unpredictability, lack of confidence and sensitivity to personal situations.  This \ndeveloped further understanding but at times had a limiting effect on the research.  It is not \npossible to provide a generalised profile of the young people due to the diversity of their \n 9 \nbiographies.  The main commonality was negative, and incomplete, experiences of formal \neducation.  Reasons for joining programmes varied considerably and nearly all aimed to enter \nemployment.  While problematic personal circumstances were a feature, equally so were \nsupportive parents and siblings. \n \nInterviews with programme workers covered policy implementation and the challenges and \npositive aspects of delivering the programmes.  Interviews with Connexions PAs sought a \ndifferent perspective of the programmes and brought useful insight in relation to policy \ndiscourses, programme provision and the challenges of the target-oriented work environment. \n \nData was analysed thematically in an attempt to document progress through the programmes \nfrom the perspectives of young people, programme workers and PAs and one-to-one work \nwith young people was developed into individual accounts.  A qualitative evaluation report, \nbased on the young people\u2019s experiences of the programmes, was disseminated among \ntraining providers, Connexions and the local Learning and Skills Council and some \nprogramme changes were made based on the young people\u2019s responses.  The following \nsections communicate some of the findings, in particular the impact of the context of young \npeople\u2019s lives in delivering training programmes, observations of young people\u2019s progress \nand finally the implications of the targets set for training programmes.  All names have been \nchanged and workers are only identified by their professional role. \n \nAccounting for the Context of Young People\u2019s Lives \nThe challenges of delivering \u2018Life Skills\u2019 programmes must be understood in relation to the \nyoung people\u2019s previous educational experiences and social context.  Hodgson (2002) \nidentified three categories of young people that do not make a successful transition from \nschool into education, employment or training: low attainers; underachievers, and those with \nlearning difficulties.  The detrimental impact of negative educational experiences, and their \nsignificance in understanding disengagement and reengagement, is not considered in social \n 10 \nexclusion discourses which focus on education and employment in achieving social inclusion.  \nMost young people described disengagement from formal learning, and any form of routine, \nfor a significant period before joining the programmes and framed their lack of concern with \nthis situation in the context of negative experiences of education.  Reasons for disengagement \ndiffered considerably from policy assumptions about non-participation based on individual \ndeficit and self-exclusion (Colley and Hodkinson, 2001).  Self-exclusion was evident in some \ncases but there were complex and unacknowledged reasons, such as bullying, behind this \nwhere young people described their exclusion from education as \u2018imposed\u2019.  Exclusion from a \nschool\u2019s main classroom was also common for young people with learning difficulties.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs basic skills are a core component of programmes, workers had to consider young people\u2019s \nnegative experiences of education, varied levels of ability and associated lack of confidence.  \nYoung people were aware this assistance was beneficial but engaging some in such sessions \nwas problematic, especially those delivered by external tutors and in group settings as most \nyoung people were nervous about re-entering environments that, to them, resembled formal \neducation.  Therefore, this work was closely linked to the on-going fostering of confidence \nand self-esteem and, where possible, conducted in small groups or individually.  From \nteaching basic skills, addressing issues of authority and building confidence, workers were \nCase One \nI met Jack (17) on my first visit to one programme and was informed that he was a \nquiet group member, with low confidence, who had experienced problems with \nbullying at school.  He was also attending the programme to improve his basic \nlevel of literacy and Jack told me that he was recently diagnosed with dyslexia.  \nJack spoke of his exclusion from the main classroom at school and being sent to \n\u2018The Place\u2019 (a class for pupils disrupting lessons or unable to participate at the \nlevel of other pupils).  Jack often refused to go and argued with teachers to stay in \nthe main classroom.  He appeared disheartened by his experience of education, \nnoted particularly in relation to art \u2013 the one subject where he thought he would \nget a good result, but he failed to complete the written part of the assessment.  He \nleft school with few qualifications or ambitions but said: \u2018All I cared about was \nleaving\u2026\u2019 and in the subsequent months he was \u2018hanging around\u2019 at home until \nhis parents persuaded him to join the programme.  As part of the programme he \nattended college one morning a week, to study Maths and English, and identified \nthe value of support from the programme workers and his peers in relation to this. \n    \n 11 \nboth sensitive to young people\u2019s experiences as well as encouraging participation in \neducation-based work: \nThe people I\u201fve got at the moment, because they\u201fre very complex, it\u201fs not just a case of \nsitting down and going \u201coh yeah, you\u201fve improved on your Maths and English, you\u201fre \nconfidence is a bit better, see you next week.\u201d  It\u201fs not that at all. (Programme worker) \n \nUltimately, developments in literacy and numeracy are beneficial, if not necessary in gaining \nemployment (Lloyd and Payne, 2003), as without such basic skills young people\u2019s \nemployment opportunities are limited (Bynner, 1998), but progression for some could take \nconsiderable time.   \n \nFor some young people, disengagement from, and lack of formal success in, education was \ninextricably bound with complex personal circumstances.  Support in addressing difficult or \nchaotic personal circumstances, and dealing with related unpredictability, provided the \ndemanding and intensive context for much of the work.  This wider context often manifested \nitself in young people arriving with issues from the previous evening or weekend.  The \nimmediacy of such personal problems needed to be addressed before delivering training-\nfocused work and as an on-going process as progress in other areas would be counter-\nproductive or impossible: \nThey are going to come in and they are going to have had a bad day.  They might have \nhad a bad weekend.  Tom, for instance, disappeared for two weeks.  You can\u201ft just say \n\u201cok, we\u201fre going to get you into a job when you come back!\u201d You know, \u201cwhere have you \nbeen, what\u201fs happened, you look thin, have you been eating?\u201d Counselling might be an \noption\u2026 And every single one of them in some form, whether it be big or little, has an \nissue.\u201d (Programme worker) \n \n \nAs well as support, programmes also offered stability and an escape from, or alternative to, an \notherwise chaotic social context.  The challenge of this wider context is significant in any \nunderstanding of the effectiveness and attribution of programmes: \nI don\u201ft want to paint a drab picture, but I think most of the young people we\u201fve got are \nundernourished because they did not have good diets when they were younger.  They\u201fre \npoorly dressed. They\u201fve got bad hygiene, and I\u201fm talking in general.  I mean we can\u201ft \neradicate poverty\u2026 but we can give them some form of there is better than this if you \nwork hard and you attend and you\u201fve got a reasonable personality, you\u201fll get on\u2026 They \n 12 \ncome here and they look at us and we\u201fre here everyday and it\u201fs something permanent in \ntheir lives. (Programme worker) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe high levels of support relied upon the professionalism of the project workers, but the \ndemanding nature and extent of this support is unaccounted for.  Workers also had to find a \nbalance between providing such support and ensuring young people were progressing and not \nbecoming too dependent: \nYou get phone calls when you\u201fre at home\u2026 If someone rings you and they\u201fre really \ndistressed, you\u201fre going to help them aren\u201ft you?  It\u201fs very difficult to be able to switch \noff\u2026 I\u201fll be driving home and\u2026 people ring me going \u201cI don\u201ft want to go home, I don\u201ft \nwant to.\u201d  It\u201fs very difficult and they\u201fre of an age as well when there\u201fs only certain things \nyou can do\u2026 And some of the things that they tell you\u2026 It consumes you so much that \nyou\u201fve got to have some sort of outlet, whether its sport or whatever.  You\u201fve got to have \nsomething.  You couldn\u201ft go from here at the end of the night, every night, and not go \nabsolutely mad I think. It wouldn\u201ft be possible. (Programme worker) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCase Two \nLara (17) had few qualifications but did not need assistance in basic skills and \ninstead of attending these sessions received one-to-one help from a support worker \nto address personal problems.  She frequently arrived at the programme with \nproblems related to her family, her housing situation and involvement in violent \nincidents.  This one-to-one support was identified by Lara, and the support worker, \nas leading to positive outcomes for Lara because she was talking through and \nbeginning to address her dependence upon alcohol, some of her family issues and \nher independent living situation.     \nCase Three \nKate (17) often moved between her parents\u2019 and grandmother\u2019s homes and was \nrelied upon as childcare for her younger siblings.  The workers closely monitored \nthis context and there were issues they could not disclose to me.  The workers \nwere seeking professional support from an arts therapist to work with Kate who \nwould often draw and paint pictures.  As a result of a swimming trip with the \nprogramme, workers also intervened to address some hygiene-related health \nissues.  After much debate, the workers offered Kate some of their clothes and \nsome toiletries to keep in their office for Kate to access.  The workers also \narranged a \u2018girls day\u2019 where we went to a local college and the young women had \ntheir hair washed and cut, followed by underwear shopping where the worker \nbought underwear for Kate and an item each for the other two young women.  The \nday ended in a caf\u00e9 with a drink and a chat about the day.  There were \nopportunities throughout this informal outing to introduce hygiene-related issues \nin a non-threatening or too personal way.  This only provides anecdotal evidence \nbut is an example of the workers addressing a highly sensitive issue.   \n 13 \n \nMaclagan (1992) has questioned if training programmes should be providing such levels of \npersonal support but it was apparent during this research that, if progress towards achieving \nthe targets was to be made, such support was needed.  Workers sought expert advice from \nprofessionals but the trust-based relationship established with young people often meant their \nengagement with other agencies was problematic, creating further demands on the capacity of \nthe workers.  \n \nAccounting for Progress and Development over Time \nYoung people\u2019s progression on the programmes was \u2018process-based\u2019, from initial engagement \nto the gradual establishment of relationships with workers, the growth of confidence and \ndevelopment of skills.  This process was observed and explored through the course of this \nresearch and these features formed the basis of both young peoples\u2019 and workers\u2019 descriptions \nof the programmes.  The relationships, it could be argued, are the basis of effective delivery, \nhowever, the roles of training programme workers are scarcely mentioned in the programme \nspecifications. \n \nProgress was an individual and gradual process with personal outcomes, such as increased \nconfidence and improvements in punctuality and attendance, difficult to attribute (Ord, 2004).  \nFor programme workers success was framed in terms of young people attending every day, \nimproving their appearance and assuming responsibility in the group.  These, often \nsignificant, developments showed clearly for one worker that a young person had: \u2018moved \nalong the register of improvement in their lives\u2019.  In many ways, the work observed was \nbasic: assisting young people with everyday, taken-for-granted tasks, such as making a phone \ncall; improving personal hygiene; and preparing healthy food.  Yet they were highly \nsignificant in terms of the young people\u2019s progress: \n\u2026to see them progressing and actually being able to hold a conversation and look people \nin the eye and pick up the phone and speak to a stranger is absolutely amazing. \n(Programme worker) \n \n 14 \nThe development of confidence, understood by all as apparent through the small steps young \npeople had taken, including travelling alone, participating in group situations and meeting \nnew people, had wider benefits for young people\u2019s progress in other aspects of their lives.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProgrammes were often a successful mechanism for gaining work experience and the \nnetworks developed by programme workers offered employment opportunities that may \notherwise not have been available.  This also provided a transition through a supportive semi-\nindependent environment.  \n \nThe challenges involved in delivering such basic and developmental work highlights a \ndifference between policy expectations and practice.  Workers recognised employers would \nbe unaware of the significance of such developments and that the progress may not be \nsufficient to secure employment.  To achieve an apparently simple target, many young people \nwould need support and assistance over a considerable period of time.  Moving them on too \nsoon could have a further detrimental impact: \nThere are other young people who you know you are going to have for a long time.  \nThere\u201fs absolutely no way they\u201fre going to get on work placements or college yet.  You\u201fre \nlooking a couple of months down the line, if not a year, before you would even consider \nputting them in that environment because you\u201fd probably destroy them as people.  But \nthat\u201fs the problem with the programme. You\u201fre supposed to gear them up for that.  Well, \nsome young people aren\u201ft ready at all.  Not even close. (Programme worker) \nCase Four \nAnna (17) had a number of family pressures, mostly related to caring for her mother \nwho suffered ill-health.  This had a significant impact on Anna and on many \noccasions she had to cancel activities arranged with the programme because she was \ncaring for her mother.  The programme workers arranged for Anna to talk to a \ncounsellor.  Anna also had very low confidence which she identified as the reason \nfor leaving a college course.  Initially, she would not travel to the programme alone \nand was uncomfortable in large groups.  Her confidence gradually developed \nthrough small group work and encouragement to take part in activities.  She \nappreciated the small group and one-to-one support in basic skills sessions, which \nshe compared to lack of assistance in large classes at school.  Anna aimed to work in \nchildcare and the programme workers and her Personal Adviser assisted in securing \na placement at a nursery.  She appreciated this opportunity: \u2018It\u2019s good because I\u2019ve \ngot low grades and no Maths or English and I can do what I want.\u2019  In the second \ndiscussion, she had secured a place on an NVQ level 2 nursery nursing course. \n \n 15 \nThere is a clear tension here with workers managing competing priorities, feeling pressurised \nto move young people into education, training or employment whilst concerned that young \npeople needed to be prepared for this move.  An added pressure is when young people do not \nmove on to one of the prescribed outcomes: \nThey want us to support them in personal and social issues but there\u201fs no clear guidance \nas to how far you need to go with these\u2026  You can fail then, with young people, because \nyou\u201fre not able to tick that education or employment box.  And you know that you\u201fve done \nas much as you can with that young person for six months and they\u201fre a better young \nperson than when they came here.  But other people looking at the stats will think \u201coh, he \nwent on to do nothing\u201d. (Programme worker) \n \nThe lack of understanding of the work created a dilemma for the programme workers.  Part of \ntheir remit was assistance with personal and social development but, in practice, they had to \nprioritise and address complex needs in order to deliver effective training. \n \nMeasuring \u2018success\u2019 \nEven when targets were reached, the current indicators were not representative of the practice.  \nFor example, Paul (18) spent eighteen months on a programme and was identified as a \n\u2018successful\u2019 outcome since he eventually gained full-time employment.  However, this \nconcealed the varying degrees of support Paul received from the workers and his PA since he \nwas 14 years-old.  The indicator of \u2018successful\u2019 outcome, although positive, failed to provide \nan adequate summary of Paul\u2019s experiences or the workers\u2019 input.  In comparison, Mark (16) \nentered further education.  After a few months on the course, the programme workers were \ninformed that his attendance deteriorated while dealing with personal problems and he was \nsubsequently asked to leave.  The workers felt his declining attendance was not detected early \nenough and that he did not receive the close attention or support that he still needed.  Again, \nthis illustrates the inadequacy of such indicators as a measure of performance (Hodkinson and \nBloomer, 2001).   \n \nMany young people described improvements in their lives through engagement with the \u2018Life \nSkills\u2019 programmes but were still not at the point of moving into education, training or \n 16 \nemployment.  Improvements in personal situations were not always linked directly to the \nprogrammes but they could prove significant to young people and support from programme \nworkers often led to improvements in young people\u2019s housing or family situations.  Such \nachievements and developments are not reflected in current understandings of performance. \n \nThroughout the research, programme workers and PAs highlighted tensions between the \npolicy targets and the reality of their work.  For example, one PA identified that many young \npeople made \u2018small leaps\u2019 but did not achieve a successful outcome because of \u2018the sort of \nissues that they bring\u2019, and that fundamentally there was \u2018a huge gulf\u2019 between doing well on \na programme and being in a favourable position to secure employment.  The difference was \nlargely determined by the wider social and economic context and, in particular, the lack of \nemployment opportunities for young people (Roberts, 1995; Allard, 1996).  In an increasingly \nskilled and qualification driven workforce (DfES, 2002; Lloyd and Payne, 2003), even when \na young person progressed to a stage where employment was an option, for those without \nformal qualifications, or sufficient literacy and numeracy skills, it was difficult to find \nopportunities in the labour market. \n \nRealistic Policy Expectations? \nThe targets set for post-16 provision, and the related social exclusion agenda, create a \nsituation where those delivering this provision face a difficult task.  This research illustrated a \nfundamental issue, based on assumptions about young people\u2019s developmental state before \njoining the programmes.  Through detailed ethnographic research, it presented an in-depth \nunderstanding of training programmes, focusing upon the circumstances of the young people \ninvolved and the practices of programme workers.  It highlighted the complexity of the work \nand the tensions in meeting targets and providing high levels of support to young people, \nwithout which it would be unlikely that the targets would be reached.  This intensive work is \ndismissed in the formal accounts of the success or failure of programmes, which rely on \n 17 \nnumbers of young people entering education, training or employment.  Indeed, this focus \nmeans that a substantial part of the work is distorted or unrepresented. \n \nIn contrast to these formal accounts, a detailed insight into the diverse contexts of young \npeople\u2019s lives and the complexity of delivering the programmes provided an understanding of \nthe considerable progress being made at the practice level.  Capturing this in formal accounts \nis problematic, though efforts have been made to develop measurements of \u2018distance \ntravelled\u2019 (Dewson, et al., 2000; Sims, et al., 2001).  Currently these efforts reduce complex \nstories to numbers, along a linear line of progress towards a uniform destination, education, \ntraining or employment.  This research suggests that even this would fail to allow for an \nadequate evaluation of the work of these programmes.  Perhaps most importantly, \nperformance needs to be understood within the wider social and economic context in which \nthere are limited employment opportunities for young people without formal qualifications. \n \nPolicy makers developed an intervention that draws upon simple and generic understandings \nof the circumstances of young people at the margins.  \u2018Life Skills\u2019 programmes were to \nprovide tailored assistance to these young people to get them back into the mainstream.  They \nunderestimated the work required to secure these outcomes and have since relied on data that \nmisrepresents the practice.  The very basic representation of the young people in a count of \nnumbers on the programmes is misleading, let alone those of \u2018successful\u2019 outcomes.  With \nnew investment announced, following a renewed NEET strategy, now is an opportune time to \nboth evaluate provision and appropriate performance measures of post-16 provision.      \n \n                                                 \n11\n In July 2003, Entry to Employment (E2E) was introduced as the national training initiative for young \npeople who had not achieved National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Level 1 qualifications, not \nattended full-time pre-16 education and were not ready for work or college.  In December 2007, \u00a331.5 \nmillion investment over 3 years was announced for a new programme to re-engage young people in \npost-16 learning.  This will include a Foundation Learning Tier - for those who will benefit from entry \nlevel qualifications, to be fully implemented by 2010.  Funding for 16-19 learning is to be transferred \nfrom the Learning and Skills Council to Local Authorities, for consultation in early 2008 (DCSF, \n2007c). \n 18 \n                                                                                                                                            \n  \n2\n The later stages of this fieldwork were undertaken at a transitional period as Entry to Employment \n(E2E) was introduced.  No young people identified any differences at this early stage, however \nprogramme workers and Connexions PAs identified the new programmes as more targeted towards \nmoving young people into education or employment and that this would cause further tensions in \nrelation to the young people they worked with and may even mean such young people would not be \nreadily accepted on to some programmes in the future.     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 19 \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nReferences \n \nAllard, A.
