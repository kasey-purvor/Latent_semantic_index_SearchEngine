Cook \nProfessorial Research Fellow \n \nDepartment of Theology & Religion \nDurham University \nAbbey House \nPalace Green \nDurham \nDH1 3RS \n \n \n8 October 2009  \n2 \n \nIntroduction \nIt has been observed that there is a \u201creligiosity gap\u201d between the psychiatrist and the user of mental \nhealth services (Cox, 1994). Psychiatrists are said to be less likely to be affiliated with a faith \ncommunity, or to believe in God, than their patients. In this religious sense, the \u201cfaith\u201d of the \npsychiatrist would appear to be less than that of the patient, if not also than that of the average \nmember of the population. However, the faith of the psychiatrist might be interpreted in other \nways. Faith might mean a generic kind of spirituality, not linked to any religious tradition. Faith might \nalso mean an adherence to, and trust in, a particular theoretical framework or method or school of \ntherapy, or perhaps to the scientific method in general. \nWhat, then, is the empirical evidence for the existence of a religiosity gap? What might the faith of \nthe psychiatrist qualitatively appear to be? And does it make any clinical difference if there is a gap \nbetween the faith of the psychiatrist and the faith of the patient? \n \nThe Religiosity of Psychiatrists \nPublished studies of the religious affiliation and beliefs of psychiatrists were ascertained through a \nsearch of databases of publications in psychology and medicine, and through following up of \nreferences in papers so identified and in other known papers touching on this subject. In fact, the \nelectronic searches did not prove to be a very effective way of identifying the relevant empirical \nstudies. However, as there appear to have been a limited number of studies of this kind, and as \nauthors tend to cite publications of other related studies in reports on their own research, a group of \nnine publications was readily identified. Although it is difficult to be confident that this list is \ncompletely exhaustive of all such studies in the published literature (and the author would be \ninterested to hear from anyone who knows of other such studies), it would appear unlikely that \nthere are many (if any) such studies which have not been identified here. \nA tenth study (Huguelet et al., 2006) will also be discussed, in which only a small number of \npsychiatrists is included. This study is of interest by virtue of the attempt to survey the religious \naffiliation and beliefs of a sample of users of mental health services and their clinicians. \nThe samples, response rates, and findings of the nine studies are summarised in Table 1. \nFive of the studies were undertaken in the United States, two in the United Kingdom, one in Canada, \nand one in Australia and New Zealand. Response rates varied between 31% and 84%. Resulting \nsample sizes varied between 71 and 2890. Only three studies included suitable comparison groups \nwithin their study, but most cited statistics from other surveys (usually census or general \npopulations surveys) by way of comparison. \nMost of the studies were of randomly selected or complete samples of all practising or registered \npsychiatrists, selected on the basis of place of practice or nationality or membership of the relevant \npsychiatric association or college. However, two samples were specifically of old age psychiatrists, \nand one was of trainee psychiatrists. \n3 \n \nSeven of the studies included some kind of information on religious affiliation, although the kinds of \nquestions asked vary significantly and the resulting statistics are therefore not strictly comparable \nbetween studies. Similarly, seven studies enquired in one way or another about belief in God. \nHowever, only four studies reported data on both religious affiliation and belief in God for exactly \nthe same sample of psychiatrists. \nAlthough much of the research illustrating this trend is from the United States, two important \nstudies have been conducted in the United Kingdom. The first of these (Lawrence et al., 2007) \nstudied 316 members of the Faculty of Old Age Psychiatry of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. They \nfound that 58% of their sample reported religious affiliation. They did not include a control group in \ntheir study. The second (Neeleman and King, 1993) studied 231 consultants and trainees in \npsychiatry at the Bethlem, Maudsley and Royal Free Hospitals. They found that only 27% reported a \nreligious affiliation, and only 23% reported a belief in God. Although they did not have a control \ngroup, they noted (on the basis of other published surveys) that up to 80% of the population believe \nin God. They also suggested that the difference from the general population in terms of religious \naffiliation (as opposed to belief in God) was much less. \nThis area of research has been marked by lack of suitable comparison or control groups, to the \nextent that it is difficult to say with confidence that evidence for a \u201creligiosity gap\u201d actually exists. \nMost usually comparisons are made with general population surveys, which assume that mental \nhealth service users are representative of the general population. In fact, there is reason to believe \nthat religious affiliation protects against mental health and that mental health service users may \ntherefore be less likely to be so affiliated than other members of the population (H. G. Koenig, 2005). \nHowever, one study from the US showed that psychiatrists were less likely to be religiously affiliated \nor to believe in God than other physicians (Curlin et al., 2007). Another demonstrated lower rates of \nreligious affiliation amongst psychiatrists than social workers or family therapists, but only very \nslightly lower rates than clinical psychologists (Bergin and Jensen, 1990). Perhaps the best study to \ndate, conducted in Canada (Baetz et al., 2004), did include a comparison group of mental health \nservice users and found that 51% of psychiatrists, but 71% of patients reported belief in God. \nHowever, psychiatrists and patients were not different in terms of self-perception as either \n\u201cspiritual\u201d or \u201creligious\u201d. \nHuguelet et al studied one hundred patients with a diagnosis of non-affective psychosis who were \nbeing treated in a public psychiatric out-patient facility in Geneva (Huguelet et al., 2006). The great \nmajority of these patients (92%) identified spirituality as an important aspect of their lives and 66% \nfound religion subjectively important in coping with their illness, but only 40% reported having \ntalked about religion with their clinician. The clinicians involved in treating these patients (n=34, \nincluding n=19 psychiatrists) were much less likely to be religiously affiliated (53% v 92%) but were \nonly slightly less likely to acknowledge the importance of spirituality in daily living (77% v 86%) in \ncomparison with the patients. Perhaps the most important finding of this study, however, was that \nthe clinicians were often unaware of their patients\u2019 religious involvement or beliefs, or else their \nperceptions were inaccurate. None of the psychiatrists reported initiating discussion of religion with \ntheir patients. \n \n4 \n \nSpirituality and Religiosity as subjects of Psychiatric Discourse \nIf psychiatrists are less likely to believe in God, or to be religiously affiliated, they appear nonetheless \neager to engage in debate on the place of spirituality and faith in clinical practice. A recent editorial \nby Harold Koenig in Psychiatric Bulletin (Harold G. Koenig, 2008) suggested that good psychiatric \npractice should include: \n Taking a spiritual history \n Supporting healthy religious beliefs \n Challenging unhealthy beliefs \n Praying with patients (in \u201chighly selected cases\u201d) \n Consultation with, referral to, or joint therapy with trained clergy \n \nNone of these proposals were completely new, and the key points had been made previously by \ndistinguished speakers at meetings of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (A. Sims, 1994, Cox, 1994, \nHrh the Prince of Wales, 1991). Regardless of this, Koenig\u2019s editorial provoked a controversy, in \nwhich correspondents described themselves as \u201calarmed\u201d at his recommendations (Poole et al., \n2008, Lepping, 2008). The proposal to consider praying with patients in \u201chighly selected cases\u201d, \nabout which Koenig himself had urged caution, was described as \u201ctroubling\u201d (Carter, 2008), \n\u201cdangerous ground\u201d (Mansour, 2008) and \u201chighly controversial\u201d (Mushtaq and Hafeez, 2008). Why, \nthen, was there such a heated response? \nPartly, I think, the answer may be found in transatlantic cultural differences. The United States is a \nvery religious nation, and the United Kingdom is very secular. The acceptability and language of \npublic religious discourse are very different in our two nations. Secondly, I wonder if there is a \nmisunderstanding about the nature of religion and spirituality? It is patently obvious that not all \npeople (psychiatrists or patients) are religious. It is not at all obvious that there are any people \n(including psychiatrists or patients) who are not spiritual. In fact, many would argue that spirituality \nis a universal dimension of human experience (Andrew Sims and Cook, 2009). Thirdly, it might be \nargued that such emotive responses are indicative of an approach to engagement with patients \nwhich is found to be threatening or personally challenging in some way. At the very least it would \nappear that discussion about religion or spirituality engages doctor and patient in a level of discourse \nwhich is seen as transgressing professional boundaries (Poole et al., 2008). But fourthly, and finally, \nthere seems to be the strong implication that discussing such matters with patients might be \nactually harmful. Whilst abuses of spirituality or religion undoubtedly may be harmful, it is not at all \nclear what the evidence is for suggesting that these subjects should not even be discussed with \npatients. \n \nFaith in Psychiatry \nIn 1965, in his classic work The Faith of the Counselors, Paul Halmos suggested that counselling \n(within which he explicitly included psychiatry) was itself a kind of \u201cfaith\u201d (Halmos, 1979). In \nparticular, he saw it as going beyond that which is purely research based and entering into a domain \nwithin which (quite properly) people are treated as having value and being worthy of respect and \n5 \n \neven love. Similarly, HRH The Prince of Wales, in his address to the College in 1991, reminded \npsychiatrists that: \nCare for people who are ill, restoring them to health when that is possible, and comforting \nthem always, even when it is not, are spiritual tasks (Hrh the Prince of Wales, 1991) \nThe then Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, in his address to the College in 1996 (Carey, \n1997) suggested that there is a common inheritance of religion and psychiatry. In particular: \n They both understand health as something \u201cbeyond the physical\u201d \n They share values of faith, hope and love \n Psychiatry & religion need each other \n Society needs psychiatry & religion to work together \n \nPerhaps, then, we should think of the \u201cfaith of the psychiatrist\u201d in at least two different ways. On the \none hand, it refers to his or her sense of belonging to a faith community, or holding of religious \nbeliefs. On the other hand, it reminds us that psychiatry itself possesses some of the characteristics \nof a faith tradition, characteristics which overlap significantly with those of the religious traditions \nthemselves. This should not be a cause for concern, but rather for celebration. It reminds us that \nhuman beings are of greater value than can be demonstrated by the scientific method alone. It also \nsuggests that there may be important non-religious (or at least non-exclusively religious) ways in \nwhich there is no gap between the faith of the psychiatrist and his or her patient. \n \nClinical Practice \nDoes the faith of the psychiatrist make any difference to clinical practice? In a study of evangelical \nChristian psychiatrists in the United States, respondents reported the Bible and prayer as more \neffective than psychotropic medication or insight based psychotherapy in the treatment of grief \nreactions, sociopathy and alcoholism (Galanter et al., 1991). It would therefore appear that faith can, \nat least in some circumstances, affect psychiatrists\u2019 perceptions of what is most likely to help their \npatients. However, perhaps more importantly, mental health service users report that it is important \nto them to know the religious or spiritual orientation of their patients, and that spirituality or \nreligious orientation affect their choice of psychiatrist (Baetz et al., 2004). \nWhilst there are undoubtedly possibilities for spiritual or religious abuse in clinical practice, the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association long ago drew up Guidelines Regarding Possible Conflict Between \nPsychiatrists\u2019 Religious Commitments and Psychiatric Practice (Committee on Religion and \nPsychiatry, 1990). Fundamentally, these guidelines require that psychiatrists show respect for the \nreligious beliefs of their patients, and that they should not impose their own religious (or anti-\nreligious) beliefs or ideologies upon their patients. Within the guidelines, assessment of patient \nspirituality and religious belief are accepted as fundamental. Members of the Royal College of \nPsychiatrists may well ask why we do not yet have such guidelines in the UK? \nThe Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group (SIG) of the Royal College of Psychiatrists has \ntaken an interest in the development of the new College curriculum and the place (or lack of a place) \n6 \n \nof spirituality and religion within it. In the process of its work on this subject, the SIG working group \nproposed that the following might be included amongst fundamental spiritual competencies of the \npsychiatrist: \n Explore how your own spiritual\/religious beliefs may\/may not coincide with those of your \npatient. \n Identify when spiritual\/religious beliefs facilitate or obstruct the doctor-patient relationship. \n To become able to engage and be comfortable with the deepest level of personal experience \nwhich embodies human spirituality. \n Discerning when spiritual concerns are best dealt with within the doctor-patient relationship \nand recognising when additional pastoral care is required.  \n \nThe faith of the psychiatrist is as much a reality affecting the clinical consultation as is any other \npersonal attribute: gender, sexuality, race, social class, culture, personality or political belief. We can \ntry to be completely objective and professional and to ensure that these attributes do not affect our \nclinical practice. However, the reality is that sometimes they do. Being aware of this, and knowing \nhow to address it, is arguably the best way to demonstrate professionalism and sensitivity to the \nconcerns of patients. \n \nConclusions \nIt would appear that there is evidence that psychiatrists are less likely to identify with a particular \nfaith tradition, or to believe in God, than their patients. It is less clear that psychiatrists perceive \nthemselves as less spiritual than their patients and, in fact, there is some evidence that they do not. \nMore research is needed to clarify the nature and size of this \u201creligiosity gap\u201d. \nWhatever the quantitative dimensions of the religiosity gap at a population level, individual clinical \ninteractions between psychiatrist and patient will always involve a spiritual and religious component, \nwhether this is explicit or implicit. Where psychiatrist and patient experience no gap, and agree \nabout spiritual or religious matters, the danger may be of collusion in avoiding examination of \npotentially harmful aspects of shared belief or practice, but the potential benefits of identifying ways \nin which faith may benefit treatment and recovery are perhaps less likely to be overlooked. Where a \ngap exists, and there is disagreement about spiritual or religious matters, the danger may be of an \nabuse of the asymmetry of power between psychiatrist and patient in order to undermine the faith \nof the patient. But such consultations also offer the potential benefit of constructively critical, and \nmutually affirming, engagement with the ways in which different spiritual and religious traditions \nthrow light on the patient\u2019s condition and their response to it. \nWhat would seem clear to this author, although apparently controversial for British psychiatry at \npresent, is that spirituality and religion are very relevant matters in the clinical practice of psychiatry, \nwhich should be identified and addressed in the interaction between psychiatrist and patient. \nProfessional debate and training on this matter, further research, and introduction of guidelines to \nfoster and affirm good practice and to prevent bad practice, are all much needed. \n \n7 \n \nBibliography  \n \nBaetz, M., Griffin, R., Bowen, R. & Marcoux, G.
