INTRODUCTION\nT WO antenna scenarios are analyzed in this paper. Fourhalf wavelength spatially separated dipoles are compared\nwith the same dipoles that are then colocated as far as is practical\nand are able to attain decorrelation as a combination of angular\nand polarization diversity [1] as shown in Fig. 1(a), where in-\ncreasing the angle to 90 will decrease the correlation to zero\nsince the two dipoles have zero angular correlation as shown in\nFig. 1(b) if it is assumed the antennas have no mutual coupling.\nAngular correlation effectively correlates the two angular pat-\nterns in the same polarization. Therefore, if the polarizations\nof the antennas have any difference, this will provide an in-\nherent polarization decorrelation within the angular decorrela-\ntion. When is at 90 , it has the greatest polarization decor-\nrelation, which contrasts from the polarization diversity of the\nfading environment also shown in Fig. 1(b).\nThe aim of the measurements was to colocate two orthogonal\ndipole antennas (i.e., with equal to 90 ) as far as is practical\nso that their capacity potential could be compared with that of\nthe spatial case while at the same time exploiting the polariza-\ntion diversity available as much as possible from the above anal-\nysis. Other investigations into polarization diversity have been\nbased on more ideal assumptions or they have only concentrated\non directional antennas at the access point or mobile [2]\u2013[4].\nThis particular investigation will focus on obtaining decorre-\nlated branches at the mobile end with a wide angle of arrival\nby which omnidirectional antenna branches will always apply\nboth angular and polarization diversity due to practicalities of\nthe antennas. This can then be compared with the conventional\nspatial techniques to see whether exploiting use of the polariza-\ntion in the fading environment is of any benefit.\nManuscript received April 04, 2008; revised April 22, 2008 and April 29,\n2008.

Diagram showing the (a) polarization orientation of two dipole antennas\nand (b) the resultant angular and polarization decorrelation.\nIt was assumed that the fading environment has a reasonable\ncross polar ratio (XPR) and that the vertical and horizontal po-\nlarizations are independent though it was not possible to fully\ncharacterize this. It is the case, however, that having the antennas\northogonal to each other will cause some branch power ratio\n(BPR) greater than that of the spatial case, which is a disadvan-\ntage to diversity and multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO). It\nis possible that this could be avoided using the 45 orientation\nbut as was shown in [1] there is not much polarization contri-\nbution within the angular contribution to the decorrelation. The\northogonal orientation is therefore the most appropriate means\nto identify if the polarization can be best exploited.\nII. MEASUREMENT SETUP\nThe frequency of operation chosen, due to the scope of the\nchannel sounder used and the available spectrum was 2.4 GHz,\nwhich is used in WLAN applications. The sampling rate used\nwas 62 Hz, over five times the maximum Doppler shift. There\nwas need for such high sampling not just to avoid aliasing but\nalso due to the fact that there were interferences from existing\nWLANs in the surrounding area that caused occasional disrup-\ntion to the measurements with bursts of data.

Illustrations of the spatial and crossed dipoles used in the measurement.\nthe data was post processed to remove these intermittent in-\nterferences and then replace them with interpolated data. High\nsampling therefore enabled negligible effect on the resultant\nimpulse responses that were post processed into narrowband\nfading channels.\nThe reference dipoles, 0.49 in length are used as the spa-\ntially separated case are shown in Fig. 2(a) which are spaced\nhalf a wavelength apart for low correlation in the theoretical\ncase. All dipoles have a balun applied to prevent current im-\nbalance. In Fig. 2(b), the dipoles are then moved to a collocated\npoint and crossed. They are located as close as possible while\nkeeping the isolation between them above 10 dB to try and avoid\nmutual coupling effects. The horizontal dipole is about 10 mm\nbehind the vertical one and slightly lower due to the practical\nproblems of the feed cables. In this instance, there is still con-\nsiderable removal of the spatial case forming a more compact\nantenna solution so it is largely based upon polarization and an-\ngular decorrelation that we get any potential for MIMO.\nAll the antennas tested were measured along the same test\nrun using an Elektrobit Propsound channel sounder. The trans-\nmitter was based upon four patch antennas located 2.1 m high\nequivalent to that of an access point. The mobile antennas were\nmeasured in a neighboring corridor with a non line of sight envi-\nronment (NLOS) to obtain suitable multipath scattering. It is as-\nsumed that both antennas undergo the same radio environment\nconditions, which is reasonable for the purposes of evaluating\nchannel statistics and not the real time effects or second order\nstatistics.\nIn order to compare the impact each of the antennas have\non scattering and removing path loss effects, it is necessary to\ncarry out a normalization process on the measured channel data.\nTaking the spatially separated dipoles as the reference case, the\npath loss is normalized out of the channel, , as follows\nby using the maximum branch magnitude at the mobile end\nwhen transmitted from the first transmit (Tx) element. Any other\nTx element could be used in this instance as it is assumed that\nthe branch power ratio at the Tx end is unitary. By normalizing\nthis way, it ensures that the branch power ratio at the mobile\nis preserved, which will have an impact on scattering while re-\nmoving the path loss isolates any impact it has on the capacity.\nThus, the channel is normalized as\n(1)\nTo evaluate the scattering effects of the crossed dipoles com-\npared to the spaced dipoles, the same normalizing factor used\nfor the spatial case is applied so that when evaluating these two\nantennas any degradation in gain as well as difference in scat-\ntering is taken into account. Thus a fair evaluation is made of the\nantennas\u2019 comparison and two channels for the crossed dipoles,\n, are defined as\n(2)\nConsequently, using these normalized channels it is possible to\nresolve the eigenvalue decomposition, where represents the\neigenvalues and the eigenvectors of a channel\n(3)\nThus, one can calculate the Shannon capacity for a fixed signal\nto noise ratio (SNR) as follows:\n(4)\nIII. MEASUREMENT RESULTS\nFrom measuring the spatial and polarization cases, the cor-\nrelation was found to be sufficiently low in both cases, below\n0.5, which is sufficient for diversity and also multiplexing. For\nthe branch power ratios, it would be expected that the crossed\ndipoles would be worse than the spatial case, though in these\nmeasurements this was only as much as 3 dB when the ratio be-\ntween a vertical and horizontal dipole and two vertical dipoles\nwere compared. This suggests there was good depolarization in\nthe fading environment giving a good XPR though it should be\nnoted the antennas are not polarization pure so the horizontal\ndipole will still pick up some of the vertical polarization of the\nfading environment, which is in fact an advantage to balance\nthe branch power ratios better. In the spatial case, the branch\npower ratio was around 0 dB between all branches as would be\nexpected.\nIn terms of the diversity and MIMO capabilities of the spatial\nand crossed dipoles, their eigenvalues, and , are compared\nin Fig. 3 for 2 2 MIMO whereby just two antenna elements\nthat are spaced half a wavelength are taken from the spatial case\nat the receive end and two elements from the transmit end. Two\ncrossed dipoles are then compared. Therefore, a direct compar-\nison can be made between the spatially separated and differently\npolarized antennas. The results in Fig. 3 show a good compar-\nison in diversity order with comparable eigenvalue distributions.\nIt is also possible to make a direct 4 4 MIMO compar-\nison, whereby all elements from both ends are decomposed into\neigenvalues, to . In this instance, a mainly spatial diver-\nsity case is being compared with a combined spatial, polariza-\ntion and angular diversity case and again there are comparable\neigenvalues showing similar diversity order in Fig. 4. However,\nin this instance, the first two eigenvalues are shown to be slightly\nweaker in the polarization case, which is likely to be due to the\nloss of energy from the horizontal dipoles.\nFinally, the results presented in Fig. 5 compare the Shannon\ncapacity for both the 2 2 and 4 4 results. In both cases, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio is kept constant at 10 dB and it is found that\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

An un-\nknown that could not be easily characterized is the XPR of the\nindoor radio environment. This particular information would be\na useful indicator to determine whether there is sufficient depo-\nlarization that can be exploited using such antennas for MIMO\nthough the results suggest there is a significant amount. Dif-\nferent environments may not give such complete depolarization,\nwhich could more significantly degrade the MIMO performance\nsince the horizontal dipoles depend largely on the level of de-\npolarization in the fading environment, though indoor environ-\nments can typically offer such requirements.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nMeasurement results comparing mainly spatial with angular\nand polarization diversity-based antennas do indicate that there\nis potential in using orthogonal linear antennas based on these\ncombinations for MIMO applications, where antenna design\npossibilities have been analyzed [5], [6].

There are, however, further factors\nto consider on real mobile terminals such as variable antenna\norientation and user interaction, where such antennas may not be\nas effective as using spatial multiplexing. Many mobile termi-\nnals, however, are often kept stationary, which does allow scope\nfor using polarizations if the mobile has a normal orientation for\nusage.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T. W. C. Brown, S. R.
