INTRODUCTION \nEfficient transmission power utilization is an important \ndesign criterion in interference limited cellular systems, such as \nUMTS networks. System capacity is limited by the total \ninterference experienced within thc cell coveragc. Thus, the \noptimization of power consumption for an individual user can \nprovide an increase in system capacity, as well as in the quality \nof service experienced by the user. \nRecently, several energy minimization techniques for \nwireless video applications have been proposed [ I ,  21. All of \nthese techniques are optimized to achieve a target video quality \nwhile minimizing the transmission power. In [I] ,  joint error \nresilience and transmission power management at the video \nframe level is proposed. However, as video frame quality is \nvariable in nature (even in an error free environment), \ncontrolling the transmission power to  achieve a target frame \nquality at the video frame level is inaccurate and would result \nin poor system performance. This problem can he solved by \nminimizing the total consumed power within a certain period, \nwhile achieving the optimal average video quality. The method \nproposed in [2], employs this concept for Intra-refreshed video \nsequences, thus video performance is optimized for a fixed \nIntra-refresh period. However, this method can not be applied \nin conjunction with rate controlled Adaptive Intra Refresh \n(AIR) techniques [3], which is commonly used to produce a \nsmoother output hit rate for transmission over a fixed \nbandwidth channel. \nAnother issue that should he considered in the design of \ntransmit power optimization schemes is the support of network \ncompatibility and interoperahility between different networks \nand platforms. Transmit power is normally allocated at the \nphysical layer for a given Transmission Timc Interval (TTI) \n[4]. If the power allocation algorithms are closely coupled with \nthe video compression formatting as in [I], it is impossible to \nimplement such an algorithm at the physical layer without \nmodifying the entire protocol stack of the existing network. \nThe algorithm proposed in this paper takes these issues in \nto account in the design and implementation. In contrast to the \nmethod in [2], the proposed scheme can equally he applied to \nrate controlled AIR video sequences as well as intra-refreshed \nsequences. The proposed method combines a Unequal Error \nProtection (UEP) technique and an Unequal Power Allocation \n(UF\u2019A) technique to obtain energy efficient video transmission. \nUEP is performed with the use of two different radio hearers. \nAt the start of every video frame, the transmission energy for \ndifferent bearers is selected in such a way as to achieve the \nmaximum expected video frame quality for an increment in the \ntransmission power step. \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section \nI1 describes the distortion modeling for rate controlled MPEG- \n4 coded video sequences. The proposed power optimized UEP \nalgorithm is introduced in Section Ill. Section IV presents the \nsimulation set up and the algorithm implementation for UMTS \nnetworks. Experimental results and analysis are presented in \nSection V. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VI. \n11. PERFORMANCE MODELING \nThe hit stream syntax of MPEG-4 uses a hierarchical \nstructure. Each video frame is partitioned into smaller \nrectangular regions called \u201cMacro-Blocks (MBs)\u201d (16x16 \npixels in size). Each MB is coded either in inter-mode or intra- \nmode. Intra-mode MBs are transformcoded directly without \napplying motion compensation while inter-mode MB\u2019s use \nmotion compensation. Consecutive MB\u2019s are grouped to form \nVideo Packets (VP). The MPEG-4 adopted video packet \nformat is shown in Fig. I .  Synchronization markers are used to \nisolate VPs from each other. Following the concept of data \npartitioning, data within a video packet further divided into two \nmain parts. The motion related information for all the MB\u2019s \ncontained in a given VP are placed in the motion part and the \nrelevant DCT data are placed in the texture part [ 5 ] .  \nVideo Object Plane (VOP) consists of a number of VPs. \nThe most important information the decoder needs to know \npriory to the decoding of compressed video data, is placed in \nthe VOP header part. This includes the spatial dimensions of \nthe video frame, the time stamps associated with the current \nframe, presentation information and the mode in which the \ncurrent frame is coded. \n0-7803-8255-2\/04\/$20.a0 @25X IEE. 2719 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

MPEG-4 Video Packet format \nThe video information is prioritized based on the MPEG-4 \ndata partition techniques [6]. Information within the first \npartition is sent over a higher priority channel. Lower priority \nchannel is used to transmit the data within the second partition. \nVideo packet header information is added to the beginning of \nsecond partition in order to guarantee accurate stream \nsynchronization at the decoder. VOP header is also repeated in \nlower priority channel at the starting of the video frame. The \nvideo data formats in prioritized streams are shown in Fig. 2. \nVideo performance is modeled as a combination of \nquantization distortion, E(D and channel distortion. \nChannel distortion is divided into three parts; namely spatial \nconcealment distortion, temporal concealment distortion and \ndistortion due to error propagation. The distortion method \nadopted in this paper is similar to the method proposed in [2]. \nHowever, the model in [2] is enhanced for the use of AIR and \nfeatures improved error propagation estimation. \nIf the video frame configuration information or video \npacket headers are lost in the transmission, the decoding \nprocess is impossible and the data belonging to that video \npacket has to be discarded at the decoder. However, the error \nconcealment tools implemented at the decoder replaces the \ndiscarded data with error-concealed data from the neighboring \npackets. The distortion resulting from this process is called the \nspatial- concealment distortion, E(D, as only spatial \nerror concealment is involved in the process. On the other \nhand, if the Configuration information, video packet header \ninformation and motion information is received correctly but \nDCT information is corrupted, then the decoder only discards \nthe corrupted DCT data and replaces them with the \ncorresponding concealed data from the previous frame. The \ndistortion resulting from motion compensated error \nconcealment is called temporal concealment distortion, \na . J  \nE(Di-co\".pv)' \nErrors can propagate in two ways, either in the temporal \ndomain or in the spatial domain. Frame to frame error \npropagation through motion prediction and temporal \nconcealment is called temporal domain error propagation, f \nIP ' \nThe propagation of errors from neighboring video packets via \nspatial concealment is considered as spatial domain error \npropagation, 1,. \nframe quality can be written as \nTaking the video packet as the base unit, the expected \n(1) \nlJ  \ni=o \n\u20ac(e;) =lO.log(g\/ Z E ( D $ ) )  \nZ, Z. \nwhere V represents the VOP header size.

Distortion modeling \nThe expected distortions, E(DQ,,,\\,), E(D3 - con,pv)  and \nE(D,-,,,.,,,.) of the MBs are calculated as specified in [Z]. The \nquantization distortion is computed by comparing the \nreconstructed MBs and the original MBs at the encoder. \nConcealment distortions are also computed in a similar \nmanner. The transmitted video data belonging to each MB is \ncorrupted using a noise generator located at the encoder. \nCorrupted data is replaced by the concealed data and data \nbelonging to the original and concealed MB's are compared. In \nthe case of the spatial concealment distortion calculation, only \na spatial concealment algorithm is used to generate the \nconcealed data. On the other hand, a temporal concealment \nalgorithm alone is used to conceal the corrupted data for the \ntemporal concealment distortion calculation. The correct \nreception of neighboring video packets and reference video \nframes is assumed in the calculations. \nC. Propagation loss modeling \nCorrelation, between the corrupted video packets in the \nsame frame and the distortion due to the MB mismatch in \nadjacent video frames, is quantified by the spatial and temporal \nerror propagation terms in (2). \n. .  \nThe temporal propagation loss, hi' , represents the \npropagation of corrupted information through predictive \ncoding. An Adaptive Intra Refresh (AIR) algorithm, which \nuses a selected number of intra coded MBs in a video frame, is \nused to prevent the error propagation. The temporal error \npropagation is calculated at MB level. Let &;;Ab be the \ntemporal error propagation of kIh MB in Ih frame. &;A6 \ndepends on the coding mode used in the encoding of the MB. \n&jib is calculated for inter coded MBs as \nwhere E(D:t&,m6) and E(D,_con,mb) k , i , j  represent the spatial \nconcealment distortion and temporal concealment distortion of \nthe MB respectively. As before, i a n d j  represent the i\" video \npacket in \/\" video frame. \/$,ib is the spatial error \npropagation of the ICh MB i n I h  video frame. Pi; quantifies the \nfraction of distortion of the Macro Block , which should he \nconsidered in the propagation loss calculation. The P f ,  is a \nfunction of effective channel hit error rate,pbeV, and \nexperimentally it is found to he approximated to \n(10) \nF \npip =(1-(1-pbe8) I )  \nPbrff =(x'Pbl + Y ' P b 2 ) i ( X f Y )  (1 1 )  \nF' is size of the;Ihframe. Xand Yare the total amount of data \nbelonging in the first partition and the second partition \nrespectively. hi' is computed as \nR denotes the sets of macro blocks in the i I h  video packet in \nthe jth video frame. The spatial error propagation terms, f$' \nand \/$,i16 depend on the number of corrupted video packets \nin a frame and only propagate through the spatial concealment \nprocess. The \/$' and \/sp,mb are modeled as, \n. .  \n. .  k , i  \nwhere N &  and VPJ represent the number of video packets and \nthe average size of a video packet in the;Ih frame respectively. \n111. ENERGY OPTIMIZED UEP SCHEME \nLet the user requested video quality in terms of average \nframe PSNR be Q,,,,,,. Total channel interference and the \nnoise experienced is denoted by noise power spectral density, \nN o .  The minimum required transmission energy for an \ninformation bit to satisfy the user quality requirement under a \ngiven channel condition is Ebmi,. The expected video frame \nquality, \u20ac(Q,min), is computed using (1). It is assumed that the \ndata on both higher priority and lower priority channels are \ntransmitted with equal bit energies, Ehmin. Point A in Fig. 3 \nrepresents the estimated quality, E(Q,m;n). Point E shows the \nexpected quality, if the transmission energy on both channels is \nincremented by 1 dB. \nThe goal is to find the combination of transmission energies \nin the two channels, which maximize the current video frame \nquality for an increment in the transmission energy. The \ncorresponding point for optimum energy allocation is to he \nfound in the vicinity of Point B. The possible combinations of \ntransmission energy allocation in different priority channels are \nlisted in Table 1. Even though, it is valid to consider other \ntransmission energy levels, the setlings listed in Table 1 are \nmore likely to provide optimum energy allocation. Moreover, \nthis simplifies the searching procedure. The expected video \nframe qualities are computed for the energy settings listed in \nTable I and the corresponding points are shown in Fig. 3. \n0-78M-8255-2104P$20.00 02MM IEEE. 2721 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

SIMULATION SET-UP \nRealization of the proposed energy optimized UEP \nalgorithm over UMTS network is shown in Fig. 4. At the \nencoder, each encoded video frame is separated into hvo \nstream based on MPEG4 data partitioning. The separated \nstreams are mapped on to two transport channels. The high \npriority data is sent over the highly protected channel, which is \nprotected with a 1\/3 rate convolutional code. A 112 rate \nconvolutional code is used to protect the lower priority \nchannel. At the physical layer, the information on the transport \nchannels is allocated the selected transmission bit energy and is \nmultiplexed on to the same physical channel for the \ntransmission over the air interface. \nA UMTS physical link layer simulator is developed. The \nsimulator includes all the radio configurations, channel \nstructures, channel codingldecoding, spreading\/de-spreading, \nmodulation parameters, transmission modeling and their \ncorresponding data rates according to the UMTS specifications. \nThe transmitted signal is subjected to a multi-path fast fading \nenvironment, where the power-delay profiles are specified in \nPI. \nEdK.

A detailed discussion of the \nchannel simulations can be found in [9].  Using the developed \nsimulator, error characteristics of transmission channel are \nsimulated for a range of channel condition and for different \nphysical layer configurations. \nThe Vehicular A propagation condition and down link \ntransmission is considered in the experiment discussed in this \npaper. The mobile speed is set to 50 k d h .  A spreading factor \nof 32 is used in the physical channel configuration. The \nexperimentally evaluated channel BLock Error Rates (BLER) \nover the Vehicular A environment are listed in Table 11. \nVideo sequences are encoded according to the MPEG4 \nsimple profile [7] format. This includes the error resilience \ntools such as video packetisation, data partitioning, and \nreversible variable length code. The first video frame is Intra \ncoded while others use Inter coding. TM5 rate control \nalgorithm is used to achieve a smoother output bit rate, while \nan adaptive intra refresh algorithm [3] is used lo stop temporal \nerror propagation. ITU test sequence \u201cSuzie\u201d is used as the \nsource signals in the experiments. The QClF (176 by 144 \npixels) sequence is coded at 10 f p s .  \nUse of spreading factor 32 in channel configuration permits \n64 kbps and 97 khps information rates with 113 rate and 1\/2 \nrate convolutional coding respectively. \n07803-8255-2\/04620.M) 8 2 W  IEEE. 2711 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

RESULT AND ANALYSIS \nThe accuracy of the developed distortion model is \nevaluated by comparing the estimated performance and the \nactual video performance over a simulated UMTS \nenvironment. Video performance is measured in terms of frame \nPeak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), which is the standard \nobjective quality measurement. Each experiment was repeated \n20 times in order to average the effect of bursty channel errors \non the performance. The average frame PSNR is obtained by \naveraging over 6000 frames and the results are shown in Fig. 5.  \nThe experimentally evaluated channel BLER (see Table 11) is \nused in the theoretical performance calculation. As can be seen \nin Fig. 53, the theoretical PSNR values closely match the actual \nPSNR values for a wide range of channel conditions. \nExperiments were conducted for a range of channel \nconditions for both a Data Partition based UEP (DP based \nUEP) scheme and the proposed power optimized UEP scheme. \nResults are shown in terms of average Eb \/ N o  vs average frame \nPSNR in Fig. 6. The performances of 112 rate and 113 rate \nConvolutional Code without application of UEP are also \nshown. The figure clearly demonstrates that efficient energy \nutilization is achieved with the proposed method compared to \nthe traditional DP based UEP scheme as well as the non-UEP \nschemes. Video performances are limited by the quantization \ndistortion with good channel conditions. In such situation, \nincreasing the transmit power will not further increase the \nperformance. This effect is well captured by the proposed \nalgorithm and the highest allocated transmit Eh \/ N o  is limited \nto 11.2 dB. For the allocation of higher transmission energies, \nthe proposed algorithm shows close performance to that of DP \nbased UEP scheme. However, proposed algorithm \nconsiderably out-perform the DP based UEP scheme at lower \ntransmit energy. For example, for transmission of \u201cSuzie\u201d \nsequence, the achieved average frame PSNR with DP based \nUEP scheme is 18 dEl for 6 dEl energy allocation.

CONCLUSION \nAn energy eficient network compatible performance \nenhancement method is proposed for video communication \nover direct-sequence CDMA cellular networks. Prioritized \nvideo information is transmitted over two different transport \nchannels with different error protection capabilities. Transmit \nenergy for each bearer is selected to maximize the expected \nframe quality for an increment in transmit energy.
