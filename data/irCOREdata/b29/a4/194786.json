Introduction\nThe X-ray sources RX J1914.4+2456 (hereafter RX J1914, but\nnow also known as V407 Vul) and RX J0806.3+1527 (hereafter\nRX J0806) each display a single coherent X-ray and optical\nmodulation with a period of order several minutes and no other\nconfirmed modulations in any waveband observed. The most\nwidely accepted models interpret the periods as due to orbital\nmotion in a double degenerate binary system. In this scenario,\nthe two systems have the shortest orbital periods of any known\nbinary star. A review of both systems is presented by Cropper\net al. (2003).\nIn the rest of this section we summarise the observational\nhistory of the two objects and note the difficulties in reconciling\ntheir behaviour with that of double degenerate binary systems.\nIn Sect. 2 we present simple analytical estimates of the physical\nproperties of face-on stream-fed intermediate polars (IPs) and\nsimulations demonstrating the accretion flow in these systems.\nWe then consider how the various observational characteristics\nof RX J1914 and RX J0806 may be understood in terms of this\nmodel.\nSend offprint requests to: A. J. Norton,\ne-mail: A.J.Norton@open.ac.uk\n1.1. RX J1914.4+2456\nRX J1914 was identified from the ROSAT all sky survey as a\n569 s X-ray pulsator and suggested initially to be a member of\nthe then recently recognised class of soft IPs, with 569 s rep-\nresenting the spin period of a white dwarf (Motch et al. 1996).\nSubsequent ROSAT observations failed to reveal any longer pe-\nriods, apparently ruling out the IP model because an orbital pe-\nriod modulation might be expected. The unusual X-ray pulse\nprofile, with zero flux for half the cycle, was claimed to re-\nquire a system close to 90\u25e6 inclination in conflict with the lack\nof X-ray eclipses; a model in which the 569 s period is the\nbeat period was also ruled out (Cropper et al. 1998). Instead,\na double degenerate polar model was suggested, with a 569 s\norbital period \u2013 the first magnetic analogue of the AM CVn\nstars (Cropper et al. 1998). Optical and infrared spectroscopy\nand photometry of the optical counterpart revealed that the\nV-band through to J-band modulations are all roughly anti-\nphased with the X-ray modulation, that the optical and infrared\nspectra show no emission lines, and that the system exhibits\nnegligible polarisation (Ramsay et al. 2000, 2002a). As this\ncast doubt on the double degenerate polar model, alternative\ninterpretations were suggested including a double degenerate\n1026 A. J. Norton et al.: Face-on, stream-fed intermediate polars\nAlgol (direct impact accretor) system (Ramsay et al. 2002a;\nMarsh & Steeghs 2002) and a double degenerate electrically\npowered system (Wu et al. 2002). Further doubt regarding the\ndouble degenerate accretor models (polar or Algol type) was\nraised by the discovery that the X-ray modulation frequency\nof RX J1914 is increasing. If this period decrease represents a\nsecular evolutionary trend, the observation is in direct conflict\nwith a system which accretes via Roche lobe overflow from a\ndegenerate star, since in that case a secular orbital period in-\ncrease would be expected (Strohmayer 2002). Very recently,\nStrohmayer (2004) has claimed that a power spectrum of the\nChandra X-ray data shows evidence for a sideband structure\nto the 569 s signal. This indicates a previously unseen longer\nperiod in the system of around \u223c1 h. The data also confirm the\nsteady decrease of the 569 s period, with a frequency derivative\nof 6\u00d710\u221218 Hz s\u22121. A final piece of evidence that poses a ques-\ntion for all three double degenerate models was provided by a\nspectrum obtained by Danny Steeghs (private communication)\nwhich has spectral features that are consistent with those of a\nK star.\n1.2. RX J0806.3+1527\nRX J0806 was discovered as a 321s X-ray pulsator amongst\nserendipitous X-ray sources observed by the ROSAT HRI, and\nsuggested as an IP (Israel et al 1999). Its X-ray modulation\nis remarkably similar to that of RX J1914, showing a 50%\nduty cycle with the flux reduced to zero between pulses and it\ntoo was suggested to be a double degenerate polar (Burwitz &\nReinsch 2001; Israel et al. 2002). The faint optical counterpart\n(Israel et al. 1999; Burwitz & Reinsch 2001) displays an optical\nperiod coincident with that seen in X-rays and no convincing\nlonger period (Ramsay et al. 2002b; Israel et al. 2002), although\nReinsch et al. (2003) report some evidence for a possible 4700 s\nperiod in both optical and X-ray data that was also hinted at\nin the earlier observations. As with RX J1914, RX J0806 dis-\nplays antiphased X-ray and optical pulse profiles (Israel et al.\n2003a). Unlike RX J1914, the spectrum of RX J0806 shows\nfaint, broad emission lines superimposed on a blue thermal\ncontinuum (Israel et al. 2002). Further optical spectroscopy\nby Reinsch et al. (2003) rules out a main sequence secondary\nof any spectral type, but allows the possibility that the system\ncould contain a brown dwarf donor star. Polarimetric data ob-\ntained by Israel et al. (2003b) show that RX J0806 exhibits\nno circular polarization, but that linear polarization is present\nat a level of 1.7%\u00b1 0.3%. It has been reported (Strohmayer\n2003; Hakala et al. 2003) that RX J0806 shows a decreasing\nperiod, which if interpreted as a secular change in the orbital\nperiod would again rule out a system in which material is ac-\ncreted from a degenerate companion (double degenerate polar\nor Algol models). However Woudt & Warner (2003) cast doubt\non the measurement of this period derivative claiming that the\nperiod count is too uncertain.\n2. Face-on, stream-fed intermediate polars\nWe use our calculations and recent results from the literature\nto reassess the proposal that RX J1914 and RX J0806 are\nface-on, stream-fed IPs. This model was considered, but re-\njected, for RX J1914 (Cropper et al. 1998, 2003) and for\nRX J0806 (Cropper et al. 2003; Israel et al. 2003a). However,\nwe show below that their concerns are unjustified. Briefly, we\nsuggest that 569 s and 321 s are the synodic rotation periods\nof magnetic white dwarfs in IPs. The data further require that\nthe systems are seen close to face-on (i.e. at a low inclination\nangle) and are fed directly by the accretion stream (i.e. no ac-\ncretion disc is present). As in other IPs, the magnetic axis of\nthe white dwarf is assumed to be inclined at \u223c10\u25e6\u221230\u25e6 to the\nwhite dwarf rotation axis, which is perpendicular to the orbital\nplane.\nAn extension of this is to suppose that RX J1914 and\nRX J0806 are double degenerate face-on, stream-fed IPs. This\nmight be supported by the colours of RX J1914 (Ramsay et al.\n2000) and the blue spectrum of RX J0806 (Israel et al. 2002)\nbut suffers from the same problems as the other double degen-\nerate accretor models, which we discuss below. Instead we sug-\ngest that the secondary stars are very late-type main sequence,\nor in the case of RX J0806 possibly a brown dwarf.\nIn the following subsections, we begin by reviewing the\ngeneral properties of face-on, stream-fed intermediate polars\nand discuss the conditions required for stream-fed accretion to\noccur. We then show that the data on RX J1914 and RX J0806\nself consistently satisfy the predictions of this model.\n2.1. Stream-fed accretion\nIn IPs (for a general review, see Patterson 1994) the magne-\ntospheric radius lies within the white dwarf\u2019s Roche lobe and\nthe white dwarf spin is asynchronous with the orbit, typically\nPspin \u223c 103 s and Porb \u223c a few hours. Two models for the ac-\ncretion process have been suggested. (i) In most IPs, the accre-\ntion stream from the L1 point feeds a truncated accretion disc\nwhich is disrupted at the magnetospheric radius where material\nattaches to the field lines and follows them towards the white\ndwarf magnetic poles. The infalling material takes the form of\narc-shaped accretion curtains standing above the white dwarf\nsurface (Rosen et al. 1988). (ii) In some IPs however, the ac-\ncretion flow attaches directly to the field lines, without passing\nthrough a disc. Close to the white dwarf, the accretion flow\nresulting from stream-fed accretion is similar to that result-\ning from disc-fed accretion, except it is considerably less ex-\ntended in azimuth (e.g. Hellier & Beardmore 2002), see Fig. 1.\nAccretion via a combination of disc and stream is also possible\nin so called disc overflow accretion. In all models the accretion\nflow undergoes a strong shock close to the white dwarf, be-\nlow which material settles onto the surface, releasing X-ray to\noptical emission. Since the magnetic axis is generally inclined\nwith respect to the white dwarf spin axis, this gives rise to the\ndefining characteristic of the class, namely pulsed X-ray (and\nusually optical) emission. In disc-fed IPs, this pulsation will be\nat the white dwarf spin period, whereas stream-fed IPs will ex-\nhibit an X-ray pulsation at the beat (synodic) period, given by\n1\/Pbeat = 1\/Pspin \u2212 1\/Porb. (1)\nThis is due to the accretion flow flipping from one magnetic\npole to the other. Disc-overflow accretion will give rise to\nA. J. Norton et al.: Face-on, stream-fed intermediate polars 1027\nFig. 1. Schematics illustrating the azimuthal extent of the accretion region around the upper magnetic pole on the surface of the white dwarf in\nan IP. Upper panels: disc fed accretion; lower panels: stream-fed accretion. Left hand panels show the accretion flow and magnetic field lines\nfrom the magnetospheric radius to the white dwarf, viewed edge-on (i = 90\u25e6). The orbital plane, spin axis (s) and magnetic axis (m) of the\nwhite dwarf are indicated; the magnetic axis is inclined at 30\u25e6 to the spin axis in this example. Central panels show the same systems viewed\nface-on (i = 0\u25e6). The outer circle indicates the magnetospheric radius, set at five white dwarf radii here. Right hand panels show a close-up of\nthe white dwarf surface, seen face-on, with the footprint of the accretion flow highlighted. The footprint of the flow in a stream-fed system,\nhere shown with an azimuthal extent of \u223c15\u25e6, will migrate around the white dwarf surface between the two arcs indicated.\nX-ray signals at both the spin and beat periods (e.g. Norton\net al. 1997; Beardmore et al. 1998).\nThe accretion flows in IPs have been modelled as a col-\nlection of diamagnetic blobs (e.g. King & Wynn 1999; Wynn\n2000). Those blobs with a high specific orbital energy will be\nexpelled centrifugally by the white dwarf, whilst lower energy\nblobs will be accreted, spinning up the white dwarf. Eventually,\nthe white dwarf will be spinning so fast that further accretion\nis prevented and blobs will be ejected to be swept up by the\nsecondary, spinning the white dwarf down. Consequently an\nequilibrium situation results when the rate at which angular\nmomentum is accreted by the white dwarf is balanced by the\nbraking effect of the magnetic torque. This results in an accre-\ntion flow which attaches to the magnetic field at around the co-\nrotation radius, rco (i.e. the radius at which the magnetic field\nrotates at the same rate as the local Keplerian frequency).\nWhether a disc-like structure forms, truncated at rco, or\nwhether accretion is directly via a stream, depends on the rel-\native size of the magnetospheric radius (\u223cthe Alfve\u00b4n radius,\nra), which depends on the white dwarf magnetic moment, and\nthe circularisation radius rcirc at which a circular Keplerian or-\nbit would be established by the stream. In a purely stream-fed\nIP, the white dwarf has a relatively large magnetic moment and\nhence ra > rcirc. This prevents a disc forming and material from\nthe stream latches onto the field lines directly. This will initially\nspin-up the white dwarf so its corotation radius will reduce un-\ntil equilibrium is eventually reached with ra \u223c rco > rcirc.\nThe requirement that rco > rcirc leads to a condition on the\nspin period of the white dwarf (Wynn & King 1995)\nPspin > Porb(0.500 \u2212 0.227 log10 q)6(1 + q)2 (2)\nwhere q = M2\/M1 is the mass ratio of the system. Since\nthe spin periods of both RX J1914 and RX J0806 are rela-\ntively short, this implies that the orbital periods must be rel-\natively short too. In the limiting case for stability against ther-\nmal timescale mass transfer (q \u223c 1), Pbeat = 569 s implies\nPorb < 2.37 h for RX J1914 and Pbeat = 321 s implies\nPorb < 1.33 h for RX J0806. If q is smaller than this, the up-\nper limit on the orbital period of each system is even shorter.\nThis indicates that for RX J1914 and RX J0806 to be stream-\nfed they must have orbital periods below the period gap and a\nreasonably high mass ratio.\n2.2. X-ray modulation\nIn a stream-fed IP, assuming a dipole magnetic field geome-\ntry, the magnetic field lines from the inclined dipole will inter-\ncept the incoming accretion stream with a varying aspect angle\nas the white dwarf rotates. After locking on to the field lines,\nthe accretion flow will preferentially follow the \u201cdownhill\u201d di-\nrection to the nearest magnetic pole and the accretion stream\nwill flip from one pole to the other twice per rotation of the\nwhite dwarf (e.g. Norton 1993). The upper (visible) pole ac-\ncretes for half the rotation cycle of the white dwarf, whilst the\nlower (hidden) pole accretes for the other half, giving rise to\n1028 A. J. Norton et al.: Face-on, stream-fed intermediate polars\nFig. 2. Stream-fed accretion simulations for a system with Porb = 1.5 h. The system is here shown edge-on (i = 90\u25e6) and rotated to 20\u25e6 after\neclipse centre. The panels span a single beat cycle and are equally spaced in beat phase, running from top left to bottom right. With reference\nto the phasing shown in Fig. 3, phase zero occurs around the time of the central panel. Note that in this simulation the lower pole accretes\npreferentially and is only rarely free from accretion. This is entirely dependent on initial conditions, as the preference for one pole or the other\ndepends on the phase and angle at which the stream and field first come into contact at the magnetosphere.\nan X-ray modulation on the beat period. As an example, we\nshow in Fig. 2 a simulation of stream-fed accretion flow in a\nsystem with parameters appropriate to RX J1914 or RX J0806,\nfollowing the prescription of King & Wynn (1999) and Wynn\n(2000). We emphasise that this is merely illustrative to demon-\nstrate that a stream-fed accretion flow is possible for the system\nparameters applicable to these objects.\nThe lack of any other X-ray periods is understandable in\nthis model. There will be no modulation at the spin period of\nthe white dwarf since there is nothing which has a structure or a\nvisibility which varies at this period. We note that Reinsch et al.\n(2003) report there is a possible \u223c4700 s period present in both\nX-ray and optical data from RX J0806, and that Strohmayer\ndetects a sideband structure in the X-ray power spectrum of\nRX J1914 indicating a period close to \u223c1 h. These could rep-\nresent the orbital periods of the systems and their values are\nconsistent with our prediction that Porb < 1.33 h for RX J0806\nand Porb < 2.37 h for RX J1914.\nCropper et al. (1998) rejected the face-on, stream-fed IP\nmodel for RX J1914 on the grounds that the X-ray emission\nfrom the upper pole would not drop to zero when the stream\nfeeds the lower pole, because the travel time of the accreting\nmaterial is of the same order as the 569 s period, and also be-\ncause they thought it unlikely pole-switching can produce the\nrequired sharp rise times seen in the X-ray pulse profile. Our\nsimulations indicate that the pole-switching is complete and\nrapid (Fig. 3), with rise and fall times for the number of par-\nticles accreted of order \u223c0.1 in beat phase. Thus when the sys-\ntem is viewed face-on, the X-ray lightcurve will also be fully\nFig. 3. Results of the stream-fed accretion model illustrated in Fig. 2,\nshowing the number of \u201cparticles\u201d accreted by the upper pole as a\nfunction of beat phase. For a face-on system, this will be similar to the\nX-ray lightcurve.\nmodulated with a sharp rise and fall. We recognise that the\nprofile in Fig. 3 does not exactly mimic the X-ray pulse pro-\nfiles of RX J1914 and RX J0806, but emphasise this merely\nshows an illustrative accretion duty cycle. Precisely what the\nX-ray flux duty cycle would be depends on the details of the\nshock front at the impact site, the radiative transfer process and\nother considerations beyond this simple model. Nonetheless, it\nis apparent that a face-on, stream-fed IP model can produce an\nX-ray modulation similar to those observed, and rejection of\nthe model on these grounds is not justified.\nA. J. Norton et al.: Face-on, stream-fed intermediate polars 1029\nThe simulations in Fig. 2 indicate that the field effectively\ndams the flow of matter at certain phases and then allows a\nburst of accretion as each pole rotates close to the stream. This\neffect is responsible for the sharp spike seen in Fig. 3 at the\nbeginning of each cycle of accretion onto the upper pole. The\nsteepness of the rise and fall shown in Fig. 3 may be under-\nstood as follows. The free fall time onto a white dwarf from\n1010 cm (the typical distance at which material might be ex-\npected to attach to field lines) is \u223c100 s. However, the time by\nwhich the \u201cturn-off\u201d at the upper pole is delayed as a result\nof the free-fall time is the same as the delay in the subsequent\n\u201cturn-on\u201d at the same pole and a duty cycle of \u223c50% can re-\nsult. Hence the rapid rise and fall is essentially independent of\nthe free-fall time. The rise and fall time does depend on the az-\nimuthal extent of the stream. The width of the accretion stream\nis initially set by the nozzle at the L1 point (see Eq. (5)) which\nin this case is of order 109 cm. The stream width is roughly\nconstant from here to the magnetospheric radius and will de-\ntermine the range of azimuth over which material attaches to\nthe field lines. Since material then follows the field lines down\nto the white dwarf surface, this range in azimuth will be main-\ntained, although the linear extent of the stream is greatly re-\nduced (Fig. 2) as the field lines converge. The azimuthal extent\nof the arc which forms the footprint of the accretion flow on the\nwhite dwarf surface (Fig. 1) will therefore reflect the original\nazimuthal extent of the stream. As Fig. 3 shows, a stream with\ninitial width of \u223c109 cm still gives rise to a sharp rise and fall\nin the X-ray pulsation.\nThe rise time of the observed X-ray pulse profiles in both\nRX J1914 (Cropper et al. 1998) and RX J0806 (Burwitz &\nReinsch 2001) extends over <0.15 in phase, indicating an az-\nimuthal stream extent of <50\u25e6. Hellier & Beardmore (2002)\nshow that observations of the stream-fed IP V2400 Oph are\nconsistent with a model in which the azimuthal extent of the\naccretion stream is around 20\u25e6.\nV2400 Oph is the clearest example of a stream-fed IP previ-\nously known (Buckley et al. 1995, 1997; Hellier & Beardmore\n2002) although FO Aqr (Beardmore et al. 1998) and TX Col\n(Norton et al. 1997) have each been seen to switch between pre-\ndominantly disc-fed and predominantly stream-fed accretion\nmodes on timescales of years or months. V2400 Oph is also\na low inclination system with i < 10\u25e6 (Buckley et al. 1997). In\nthis case, the X-ray pulse is roughly sinusoidal and, unlike the\ncase of RX J1914 and RX J0806, does not go to zero flux for\nhalf the cycle. In order to explain this modulation, Hellier &\nBeardmore (2002) were forced to postulate the existence of a\nring of material around the white dwarf which accretes contin-\nuously onto both poles. It is only by invoking this non-stream\nelement to the accretion that they were able to justify the fact\nthe the X-ray flux in V2400 Oph does not drop to zero.\n2.3. X-ray spectra\nBoth RX J1914 and RX J0806 have X-ray spectra that are\nwell fitted by simple blackbody models with temperatures of\n43 eV (Motch et al. 1996; Cropper et al. 1998) and 64 eV\n(Israel et al. 2003a) respectively. Neither object shows evi-\ndence for the hard X-ray component seen in other IPs, and on\nthese grounds Israel et al. (2003a) rejected the IP interpretation\nof RX J0806. However, unlike other IPs, the X-ray emitting\nregions in RX J1914 and RX J0806 are fuelled purely by a\nstream-fed accretion flow. This means that the accretion foot-\nprint is much smaller than in the case of disc-fed systems. We\nalso suggest that both systems have relatively high accretion\nrates (see Sect. 2.9). Given these constraints it is more likely\nthat the accreting material becomes buried beneath the white\ndwarf surface before releasing X-rays (Frank et al. 1988). The\noutcome of such an accretion mode is a blackbody X-ray spec-\ntrum, as observed in these systems. In the other stream-fed\nsystem, V2400 Oph, part of the flow is disc-fed (Hellier &\nBeardmore 2002) and so will have a conventional flow, produc-\ning hard X-ray bremsstrahlung emission from beneath a shock\nsituated above the white dwarf surface.\n2.4. Optical and infrared modulation\nThe azimuthally concentrated footprint of the accretion stream\non the white dwarf surface will migrate around the magnetic\npole to follow the incoming stream (Fig. 1), as the field lines\nwhich have captured the flow change on the synodic spin pe-\nriod (Norton 1993). We suggest this will leave behind a heated\ntrail on the white dwarf surface which will be a source of op-\ntical\/infrared blackbody radiation. The upper magnetic pole of\nthe white dwarf will be heated by the accretion flow for half\nthe rotation period. When the stream flips to the lower pole,\nthe heated trail will be completely exposed and the optical to\ninfrared emission from the whole of this heated region will be\nseen. As long as some part of the optical to infrared emission\nfrom the heated trail is absorbed by the flow whilst the accre-\ntion stream is feeding the upper pole, then a residual optical\nto infrared modulation will remain and be antiphased with the\nX-ray.\nTo assess the viability of this scenario for RX J1914, we as-\nsume Porb \u223c 2 h, so the secondary star has M2 \u223c 0.2 M\u0004, R2 \u223c\n0.2 R\u0004 and T2 \u223c 3000 K. In order to have rco > rcirc (Eq. (2)),\nthis orbital period requires q \u223c 0.6, so we assume for the white\ndwarf, M1 \u223c 0.3 M\u0004 and therefore R1 \u223c 1.25 \u00d7 109 cm. For\nillustrative purposes we further assume that the heated trail left\nbehind after the stream has flipped to the lower pole has a tem-\nperature of order 105 K and occupies an area on the white dwarf\nof order 0.2% of its surface. This area is \u223c a few times the\nhotspot area in polars (Warner 1995) since it is the trail of a\nstream we must consider here, not the stream footprint area it-\nself. We then assume that when the stream is feeding the upper\npole, one-fifth of the heated trail is obscured by the stream it-\nself. Then, in the V-band, the ratio of blackbody flux from the\nobscured part of the heated trail to that from the secondary star\nplus contributions from elsewhere in the system (assumed to be\ncomparable to that from the secondary star) is of order 15%, in\nagreement with the \u223c15% modulation observed in the V-band\nflux (Ramsay et al. 2002a). A similar calculation and conclu-\nsion applies to RX J0806, although here the secondary star\nis likely to be even fainter and so contribute even less light\n(Reinsch et al. 2003).\n1030 A. J. Norton et al.: Face-on, stream-fed intermediate polars\nThe X-ray spectrum of RX J1914 is best fit by a black-\nbody of temperature 43 eV (Motch et al. 1996; Cropper et al.\n1998), corresponding to T \u223c 5 \u00d7 105 K. We assume this to be\nthe temperature of the stream footprint, with an area \u223c0.04%\nof the white dwarf surface, whilst material is feeding the visi-\nble pole. The ratio of the X-ray flux in the ROSAT band (0.1\u2013\n2 keV) from blackbodies at temperatures of 5 \u00d7 105 K and\n105 K, with the cooler one occupying five times greater area,\nis about 150. Therefore the heated trail left behind after the\nstream has flipped to the lower pole would indeed give rise to\nan X-ray modulation with an amplitude of close to 100%, as\nobserved (Cropper et al. 1998). Once again, a similar result\nmay be obtained for RX J0806.\n2.5. Optical spectra\nThe optical spectrum of RX J0806 shows faint, broad emis-\nsion lines which are claimed to be mostly those of the HeII\nPickering series (Israel et al. 2002), i.e. transitions from n =\n5, 6, 7, 8... to 4. However, the lines corresponding to even terms\nof the series are all stronger than those of the odd terms. The\nmost likely explanation for this is that the even lines are each\nblended with those of the Balmer series which occur within\n2 \u00c5 in each case (HeII Pickering \u03b2 \u223c H\u03b1, HeII Pickering\n\u03b4 \u223c H\u03b2, etc.). This is unlike the spectra of any of the known\nAM CVn stars (e.g. Marsh et al. 1991; Groot et al. 2001; Ruiz\net al. 2001). None of these interacting double degenerate sys-\ntems show any evidence for hydrogen and none of them show\nthe HeII Pickering series. Any hydrogen in the precursor to an\nAM CVn system is believed to be lost during the two com-\nmon envelope phases that are necessary to achieve the close\norbit. If RX J0806 is a double degenerate with an orbital pe-\nriod of 321 s, it too should have lost all its hydrogen. The\nshortest orbital period possible for a system with a degenerate\nhydrogen-rich donor star is \u223c30 min (Rappaport et al. 1982).\nHence the presence of hydrogen in the spectrum of RX J0806\nargues against the three double degenerate binary models for\nthis system.\nSimilar blending of Balmer lines with HeII lines has\nbeen seen in the outburst spectra of the soft X-ray tran-\nsient XTE J2123\u2013058 (Hynes et al. 2001). In quiescence\nXTE J2123\u2013058 has a well-studied late K dwarf absorption\nspectrum with H\u03b1 emission from the accretion disc (Casares\net al. 2002; Tomsick et al 2002); no abundance anomalies have\nbeen reported. Hence normal abundance material can produce\na spectrum resembling that of RXJ0806 if the physical condi-\ntions are appropriate. In Sect. 2.3 we showed that the stream-\nfed IP model predicts a small accretion footprint and high mass\ntransfer rate, hence at the impact site on the white dwarf these\nsystems are expected to have more extreme physical conditions\nthan other IPs, and indeed the resemblance of the RX J0806\nspectrum to that of the accreting neutron star in XTE J2123\u2013\n058 is not unexpected.\nAs noted earlier, the fact that the optical spectrum of\nRX J1914 has spectral features that are consistent with those\nof a K star (Steeghs, private communication) poses a question\nfor the double degenerate models for that system too.\nA remaining issue to consider is the lack of emission lines\nin the optical and infrared spectra of RX J1914 (Ramsay et al.\n2002a). In conventional (disc-fed) CVs, the emission lines are\npresumed to originate in the accretion disc itself, from the\nbright spot where a stream impacts the disc, from a corona\nabove the disc, or (in the case of some UV lines) from a wind\nemanating from the system (Warner 1995). Clearly, a stream-\nfed IP would not be expected to exhibit emission lines from\nsuch locations. However, the disc-less polars also exhibit emis-\nsion lines, and here the line emission is attributed to the accre-\ntion stream itself. A similar origin for emission lines might be\nexpected in stream-fed IPs. The majority of the line emission\nin polars arises near the base of the accretion stream where the\nstream material is photoionized by the UV and X-ray flux from\nbelow the shock (Warner 1995). For the accretion stream in\nRX J1914, we have already suggested that the stream material\nhas a significant optical depth to the optical\/infrared continuum\nfrom the heated trail on the white dwarf surface, so it will have\nan even greater optical depth to optical\/infrared emission lines.\nTo estimate the optical depth of the stream, we first calcu-\nlate its optical depth as it emerges through the L1 point. Here,\nthe width of the stream may be approximated by\nW \u223c csPorb\/2\u03c0 (3)\nand the density at this point is given by\n\u03c1 \u223c \u02d9M\/csW2. (4)\nSo assuming T \u223c 3000 K, Porb \u223c 2 h, the sound speed\ncs \u223c 106 cm s\u22121 and the mass transfer rate \u02d9M \u223c 1017 g s\u22121 (see\nSect. 2.9), we have W \u223c 109 cm and \u03c1 \u223c 10\u22127 g cm\u22123. Using\nthe grid of low temperature opacities presented by Alexander &\nFerguson (1994), this combination of temperature and density\ncorresponds to an opacity at the L1 point of \u03ba \u223c 0.03 cm2 g\u22121.\nHence the optical depth at the L1 point, given by\n\u03c4 = \u03ba\u03c1W (5)\nis \u03c4 \u223c 3. Since the stream is essentially confined from here\ndown to the white dwarf surface, it will become more concen-\ntrated as the field lines converge near to the magnetic poles. At\nthe white dwarf surface, the width of the stream is W \u223c 107 cm\nand the density will therefore increase to \u03c1 \u223c 10\u22123 g cm\u22123.\nAssuming that the opacity obeys \u03ba \u221d \u03c11\/2, the opacity will\ntherefore be \u223c100\u00d7 higher at the base of the stream (for con-\nstant temperature along the stream). The optical depth at this\npoint is then \u03c4 \u223c 3 \u00d7 104, and the base of the accretion stream\nwill indeed be extremely optically thick.\nAllowing for the fact that the base of the accretion stream\nnear to the white dwarf will be hotter than at the L1 point, the\nopacity will not be less than \u03ba \u223c 0.3 cm2 g\u22121 which is the limit\nimposed by electron scattering at high temperatures. Even this\nopacity corresponds to \u03c4 \u223c 3\u00d7 103 for the density and width of\nthe stream at this point. Furthermore, in a face-on system with\na magnetic axis angle of a few tens of degrees, this region will\nalways be viewed through parts of the stream that are further\nout, and hence cooler and more optically thick. So it is unlikely\nthat any emission lines will be seen from a stream-fed, face-on\nIP with a high mass transfer rate.\nA. J. Norton et al.: Face-on, stream-fed intermediate polars 1031\n2.6. Radial velocity variations\nAs noted above, even though emission lines are suppressed\nin RX J1914, the accretion stream in a stream-fed IP may be\na source of optical emission lines. Close to the white dwarf\nwhere these are emitted, the velocity of the material is likely\nto be of order \u223c1000 km s\u22121, and unless the system is seen\nprecisely at an inclination of 0\u25e6, radial velocity shifts of these\nlines would be observable and vary on the orbital period of the\nsystem. However, the current data on the lines in RX J0806\nare too poor to reveal such motions, and no emission lines are\nseen in RX J1914 anyway. This suggests a test of the IP model,\nin that detailed radial velocity studies of the emission lines in\nRX J0806 should reveal a longer orbital period modulation.\n2.7. Polarization\nThe lack of polarization seen in RX J1914 (Ramsay et al.\n2002a) is consistent with the IP interpretation, as the major-\nity of IPs have lower magnetic field strengths than polars and\ndo not exhibit polarized emission. Only 5 out of \u223c25 confirmed\nIPs have been seen to emit polarized light. Similarly, the recent\ndetection of linear polarization at the 1.7% level in RX J0806\n(Israel et al. 2003b) is in agreement with the level of polar-\nization seen in the few IPs that do reveal polarized emission.\nHowever, this low level and its lack of variation is also consis-\ntent with the polarization being interstellar in origin.\n2.8. Period change\nAs noted above, IPs are expected to evolve towards an equilib-\nrium spin period with rco \u223c ra and a continuum of equilibrium\nspin rates exists with spin periods varying as a function of or-\nbital period and white dwarf magnetic moment (Wynn 2000;\nNorton et al. 2003). However, on short timescales (\u223cyears) ran-\ndom spin-up or spin-down episodes may be expected due to\nfluctuations in the mass transfer rate. Amongst other IPs, some\nare seen to be spinning down and others to be spinning up (e.g.\nPatterson 1994), with the \u02d9P of FO Aqr having been observed to\nchange sign over the last few years.\nIf the periods in RX J1914 and RX J0806 arise from ro-\ntating magnetic white dwarfs, then the recent measurements\nby Strohmayer (2002, 2003, 2004) and Hakala et al. (2003)\nimply that the white dwarfs in each system are spinning up.\n(Although, as already noted, Woudt & Warner (2003) suggest\nthat the period derivative in RX J0806 is ambiguous.) Even if\nthe period derivatives are confirmed, the few year span over\nwhich these measurements were obtained does not necessarily\nreflect a secular period derivative of the magnetic white dwarf.\nThe reported rate of change of frequency in RX J1914 corre-\nsponds to \u02d9P \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221212 s s\u22121 (Strohmeyer 2004) whilst that\nin RX J0806 corresponds to \u02d9P \u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u221211 s s\u22121 (Hakala et al.\n2003; Stromayer 2003). These are comparable with those seen\nin other IPs (Patterson 1994) and the spin up timescales are\nPspin\/ \u02d9P \u223c 9\u00d7 106 years and \u223c2\u00d7 105 years respectively. These\nare typical for a white dwarf and therefore are consistent with\nan IP model. It is entirely feasible that the period changes repre-\nsent temporary spin-up episodes, and the systems are accreting\nvia a stream with a long term white dwarf spin rate equal to\nits equilibrium value. Such a temporary spin-up phase may be\nthe result of a large mass accretion rate which in turn is due\nto magnetic activity on the secondary. The magnetic field of\nthe secondary may dominate the flow near the L1 point if the\nregion of the secondary star near the L1 point is magnetically\nactive (Barrett et al. 1988).\n2.9. Mass accretion rate\nThe measured spin-up rate may be used to estimate the mass\naccretion rate in RX J1914. As above we assume Porb \u223c 2 h,\nM2 \u223c 0.2 M\u0004, M1 \u223c 0.3 M\u0004 and R1 \u223c 1.25 \u00d7 109 cm. The\norbital separation of the two stars is therefore a \u223c 4.4\u00d71010 cm\nand the distance from the white dwarf to the L1 point is\nb = a(0.500\u2212 0.227 log10 q) \u223c 2.4 \u00d7 1010 cm. (6)\nThe moment of inertia of the white dwarf is\nI =\n2\n5 M1R\n2\n1 \u223c 3.75 \u00d7 1050g cm2. (7)\nWith a frequency derivative of \u02d9f = 6 \u00d7 10\u221218 Hz s\u22121\n(Strohmayer 2004), the implied mass transfer rate is\n\u02d9M =\n\u02d9f IPorb\nb2\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 1016 g s\u22121 \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 M\u0004 yr\u22121. (8)\nThis may be compared with the mass accretion rate derived\nfrom the X-ray spectral properties. RX J1914 has an X-ray\nspectrum best fit by a blackbody with a temperature of 43 eV\n(Motch et al. 1996; Cropper et al. 1998). The emitted black-\nbody flux is therefore FBB = 3.5 \u00d7 1018 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. If we\nassume the accretion stream impacts the white dwarf over an\narea of \u223c0.01% of its surface area as in polars (Warner 1995),\nthe blackbody accretion luminosity is LBB \u223c 7 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121\nwhich corresponds to an accretion rate \u02d9M \u223c 2 \u00d7 1017 g s\u22121 \u223c\n3 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u0004 yr\u22121 in rough agreement with the estimate from\nthe spin-up rate.\nThese mass accretion rates are relatively high for an IP and\nsupport the suggestion that a dense accretion stream is respon-\nsible for suppressing the line emission in RX J1914. We note\nthat the density of the stream is enhanced over that in a con-\nventional disc-fed IP with the same \u02d9M, since the flow in the\nstream-fed case is concentrated in a region which extends over\nonly a few tens of degrees in azimuth around the magnetic pole\ncompared with the 180\u25e6 extent of an accretion curtain in a disc-\nfed IP (Fig. 1).\n2.10. Probability of detection\nOf the four models proposed to explain RX J1914 and\nRX J0806, three have potential difficulties relating to how\nlikely it is that such systems are detectable. In the double de-\ngenerate Algol model the parameter space imposed by the ge-\nometric constraints on the system is rather confined (Marsh &\nSteeghs 2002; Ramsay et al. 2002b). In the electric star model\nthe predicted lifetime of the phase is only \u223c103 years (Wu et al.\n2002). However, the system can undergo many cycles of this\nbehaviour and so can appear as an electric star at many epochs\n1032 A. J. Norton et al.: Face-on, stream-fed intermediate polars\n(Cropper et al. 2003). This is therefore not a serious difficulty\nfor the model.\nThe apparent problem with the face-on, stream-fed\nIP model is that only \u223c1.5% of all IPs would be expected to\nhave an inclination angle i < 10\u25e6. Since V2400 Oph is al-\nready suggested to be such a system, further examples would\nnot necessarily be expected amongst the 25 or so confirmed\nIPs in the absence of selection effects. However, it may be that\nthe constraint on inclination angle necessary to produce a fully\nmodulated X-ray pulse profile can be relaxed somewhat. King\n& Shaviv (1984) and Wynn & King (1992) show that, based\non geometric considerations only, the upper magnetic pole re-\nmains constantly visible, and the lower pole is never seen, as\nlong as:\ni + m < 90\u25e6 \u2212 \u03b2 (9)\nwhere m is the angle between the dipole magnetic axis and the\nspin axis of the white dwarf and \u03b2 is the angle subtended at the\nmagnetic axis by the X-ray emitting region. As noted earlier,\nm is typically \u223c10\u25e6\u221230\u25e6, and \u03b2 will be similar. Based on this\nsimple geometry, inclination angles of up to several tens of de-\ngrees would still give rise to a fully modulated X-ray pulse in\nthe case of stream-fed accretion.\nThe fact that all three IPs with a substantial stream-fed\ncomponent are close to face-on may not be unexpected though.\nIn a stream-fed IP seen at high inclination, both poles would\nbe visible at some times during the beat cycle, and little mod-\nulation would occur as the disappearance of one pole is com-\npensated by the reappearance of the other. Therefore there is an\nobservational bias against high inclination stream-fed systems\nand in favour of low inclination stream-fed systems.\nThe fact that all three face-on IPs have a stream-fed com-\nponent is not surprising either, since a purely disc-fed face-on\nIP would display no X-ray modulation. The structure and visi-\nbility of the X-ray emitting upper pole would remain constant\nthroughout the spin cycle of the white dwarf in such a case.\nTherefore any face-on disc-fed IPs would almost certainly go\nun-recognised because X-ray variability is the usual key to the\nidentification of an IP.\nIn conclusion, the only purely stream-fed IPs that will dis-\nplay an X-ray modulation are those that are seen close to face-\non, and the only face-on IPs that will display an X-ray modu-\nlation are those in which at least some of the accretion arrives\nat the white dwarf without first flowing through a disc.\n3. Conclusions and predictions\nIt is difficult to see how the double degenerate models are vi-\nable given the observation of hydrogen lines in the spectrum\nof RX J0806 (Israel et al. 2002) and the spectral features con-\nsistent with those of a K star seen in RX J1914 (Steeghs, pri-\nvate communication). If the period decreases seen in RX J1914\n(Strohmayer 2002) and RX J0806 (Strohmeyer 2003; Hakala\net al. 2003) are confirmed, and do indeed represent secular\nchanges in the period, this too would rule out accretion from\na degenerate donor star and the identification of the periods as\norbital in nature. We note though that such period changes may\nalso be understood in terms of magnetic cycles on the donor\nstar, so this evidence is not compelling. The lack of polariza-\ntion in RX J1914 and low level polarization in RX J0806 are a\nproblem for the double degenerate polar model, whilst the geo-\nmetrical constraints argue against the double degenerate Algol\nmodel.\nFor both RX J1914 and RX J0806, the X-ray pulse profiles,\nX-ray spectra, lack of other modulation periods, antiphased\noptical\/infrared modulation, and level of polarization may be\nunderstood in terms of a face-on, stream-fed intermediate po-\nlar model. The implied orbital periods in each case are be-\nlow the period gap (RX J1914: Porb < 2.37 h; RX J0806:\nPorb < 1.33 h), and the mass ratios (M2\/M1) are relatively\nhigh. In the case of RX J1914, the lack of spectral lines and\nthe observed rate of period decrease may all be attributed to a\ncurrent phase of high mass accretion rate, with \u02d9M \u223c 1017 g s\u22121.\nThe possible detection of sideband structure in the X-ray power\nspectrum of RX J1914 (Strohmayer 2004) and the possible\nlong period X-ray modulation in RX J0806 (Reinsch et al.\n2003) each suggest that the originally detected short period is\nrelated to a white dwarf spin period rather than an orbital pe-\nriod. Finally, the preferential detection of stream-fed systems\nwith a low inclination angle may be the result of observational\nselection effects.\nIf the face-on stream-fed IP model is correct, then the emis-\nsion lines seen in RX J0806, and any which are ever detected\nfrom RX J1914, should exhibit no sinusoidal radial velocity\nvariations at the 321 s or 569 s periods, but may show mod-\nulation at a longer orbital period. If, instead, 321 s and 569 s\ndo represent orbital periods in double degenerate binaries then\nsinusoidal radial velocity variations should be present at these\nperiods. In the face-on, stream-fed IP model, there may be a\nkinematic signature of the flipping accretion stream in any lines\nwhich are found. For half the beat cycle, the stream flows es-\nsentially towards the observer before turning to crash onto the\nupper, facing, magnetic pole of the white dwarf. For the other\nhalf of the beat cycle, the stream flows away from the observer,\nbefore turning to crash onto the lower, hidden, magnetic pole.\nThis stream-flipping may lead to velocity variations of spectral\nlines. Any variation would be at the 569 s or 321 s period in the\ntwo systems but would not be a simple sinusoidal modulation.\nAcknowledgements.
