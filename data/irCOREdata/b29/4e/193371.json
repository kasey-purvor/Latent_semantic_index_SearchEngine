Doi: 10.1042\/bj20020446Metadata only entryWe have assessed the growth response of Chinese-hamster ovary (CHO) cells to activation of recombinantly expressed G-protein-coupled muscarinic M2 or M3 acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). We show that activation of these receptors leads to divergent growth responses: M2 AChR activation causes an increase in DNA synthesis, whereas M3 AChR activation causes a dramatic decrease in DNA synthesis. We have characterized the M3 AChR-mediated growth inhibition and show that it involves a G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. Further analysis of this arrest indicates that it involves an increase in expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21Cip1\/Waf1 (where Cip1 is CDK-interacting protein 1 and Waf1 is wild-type p53-associated fragment 1), in response to M3 AChR activation. This increase in protein expression leads to an increase in p21Cip1\/Waf1 association with CDK2, a decrease in CDK2 activity and an accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. The increased p21Cip1\/Waf1 expression is due, at least in part, to an increase in p21Cip1\/Waf1 mRNA, and receptor-mediated changes in phosphorylation of c-Jun provide a mechanism to account for this p21Cip1\/Waf1 transcriptional regulation. Evaluation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activities has shown striking differences in the profiles of activation of these mitogen-activated protein kinases by the M2 and M3 AChRs, and their potential involvement in mediating growth arrest by the M3 AChR is discussed","downloadUrl":"","fullTextIdentifier":null,"pdfHashValue":null,"publisher":"Portland Press","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/1541<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2012-09-13T13:08:59Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_112<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9550<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_69<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_113<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_70<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nGrowth inhibition by the muscarinic M3 acetylcholine receptor: evidence for p21Cip1\/Waf1 involvement in G1 arrest<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nBurdon, Drew<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nPatel, Rajnikant<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nChalliss, R.A.
