Rather,\nthere is strong variability of the heart rate. The complexity of this heart rate variability\n(HRV) presents a major challenge that has attracted continuing attention. Many of\nthe explanations proposed are by analogy with paradigms used in physics to describe\ncomplexity, including: deterministic chaos [1]; the statistical theory of turbulence [2];\nfractal Brownian motion [3]; and critical phenomenon [4]. They have led to new\napproaches and time-series analysis techniques including a variety of entropies [5, 6, 7],\ndimensional analysis [8], the correlation of local energy fluctuations on different scales\n[9], the analysis of long range correlation [10], spectral scaling [11, 12], the multiscale\ntime asymmetry index [13], multifractal cascades [14, 15]. All these measures allow one\nto describe HRV as a non-stationary, irregular, complex fluctuating process. Depending\non the technique in use there has been a very wide range of conclusions about the\nregulatory mechanism of heart rate, ranging from a stochastic feedback configuration\n[16] to the physical system being in a critical state [9]. HRV can also be considered in\nterms of the interactions between coupled oscillators of widely differing frequencies [17].\nAlthough we now have this huge variety of tools and approaches for the analysis\nof HRV, only the last-mentioned has enabled us to understand the origins of some of\nthe time-scales embedded in HRV. Each time-scale (frequency) in the coupled oscillator\nmodel [17] is represented by a separate self-oscillator that interacts with the others,\nand each of the oscillators represents a particular physiological function. The frequency\nvariations in HRV can therefore be attributed to the effects of respiration (\u223c0.25Hz),\nand myogenic (\u223c0.1Hz), neurogenic (\u223c0.03Hz) and endothelial (\u223c0.01Hz) activity.\nHRV also contains a fast (short time-scale) noisy component which forms a noise\nbackground in the HRV spectrum and can be modelled as a white noise source [17].\nIts properties are currently an open question, and one that is important for both\nunderstanding and modelling HRV. A practical difficulty in experimental investigations\nis the presence of a strong perturbation, respiration, that occurs continuously and exerts\na particulary strong influence in modulating the heart rate. This modulation involves\nseveral mechanisms: via mechanical movements of the chest, chemo-reflex, and couplings\nto neuronal control centres [18]. Spontaneous respiration gives rise to a complex non-\nperiodic signal, and this complexity is inevitably reflected in HRV [19]. So, in order to\nunderstand the properties of the fast noise, one would ideally remove the respiratory\nperturbation and consider the residual HRV which would then reflect fluctuations of the\nintrinsic dynamics of the heart control system.\nConsideration of the intrinsic activity of the heart control system on short-time\nscales is important for general understanding of the function of the cardio-vascular\nsystem, leads potentially to diagnostics of causes of arrhythmia involving problems with\nneuronal control [20], and can be a benchmark for modeling HRV. In this paper we\npresent the results of an experimental study of the intrinsic dynamics of the heart\nregulatory system and discuss these results in the context of modelling the fast noise\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 3\n0.85\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n \nR\nR\n\u2212i\nnt\ner\nva\nls \n[se\nc]\n (a)\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n0.7\n0.75\n0.8\n time [sec]\n (b)\nFigure 1.

A number of open problems are identified.\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 4\n2. Experimental results\nWe analyse the dynamics of the control system in the absence of explicit perturbations\nby temporarily removing the continuing perturbations caused by respiration [figure 1(b)].\nTo do so, we perform experiments involving modest breath-holding (apn\u0153a) intervals.\nNote that during long breath-holding the normal state of the cardiovascular system is\nsignificantly modified [21]. The idea of the experiments came from the observation that\nspontaneous apn\u0153a occurs during repose. Apn\u0153a intervals of up to 30 sec were used,\nenabling us to avoid either anoxia or hyper-ventilation [21].\nRespiration-free intervals were produced by intermittent respiration, involving an\nalternation between several normal (non-deep) breaths and then a breath-hold following\nthe last expiration, as indicated by the dashed line in figure 1(b). The respiratory\namplitude was kept close to normal to avoid hyper-ventilation, and there were relatively\nlong intervals of apn\u0153a when the heart dynamics was not perturbed by respiration. It\nis precisely these intervals that are our main object of analysis. The durations of both\nrespiration and apn\u0153a intervals were fixed at 30 sec.\nMeasurements were carried out for 5 relaxed supine subjects, and they were\napproved by Research Ethics Committee of Lancaster University. Note that the\nmeasurements presented have been selected from a larger number of measurements to\nform a set recorded under almost identical conditions of time and duration, with the\nsubjects avoiding either coffee or a meal for at least 2 hours beforehand. They were 4\nmales and 1 female, aged in the range 29\u201336 years, non-smokers, without any history\nof heart disease. We stress that the aim of the current investigation was exploratatory:\nto study typical behaviour of the internal regulatory system; we have not performed a\nlarge-scale trial of the kind widely used in medicine when a large number of subjects\nis necessary because of the need for subsequent statistical analysis of the data. The\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration signals were recorded [17] over 45-60 minutes.\nThe ECG signals were transformed to HRV by using the marked events method for\nextraction of the RR-intervals which are shown in figure 2.\nFigure 1 shows RR-intervals found for the different types of respiration. It is\nevident that respiration changes the heart rhythm very significantly. Immediately\nafter exhalation (b), there is an apn\u0153a interval where the heart rhythm fluctuates\naround some level. These fluctuations correspond to the intrinsic dynamics of the heart\ncontrol system. It is clear from (a) that heart rate is continuously perturbed during\nnormal respiration, whereas in (b) one can distinguish an interval of intrinsic dynamics\ncorresponding to apn\u0153a. Thus, the jth interval of apn\u0153a is characterized by the time\nseries {RRi}; here i = 1, 2 . . . labels the ith RR-interval. Finally, we form a set {RRi}\nj\nfor analyses by considering the set as realizations of a random walk and analyzing their\ndynamical properties as such.\nTo reveal dynamics additional to RR-intervals, the differential increments \u2206RRi =\nRRi+1\u2212RRi were analyzed. The differences between RR-intervals and their increments\nare illustrated in figure 3. Each apn\u0153a time-series {RRi}\nj exhibits a trend that is\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 5\n\u22120.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n \nR\nR\nij  [\nse\nc] \n~\n (a)\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\u22120.1\n0\n0.1\n i\n \n\u2206 \nR\nR\nij  [\nse\nc] \n~\n (b)\nFigure 3.

The trend can be characterized by the distribution of\nslopes P (a) shown in figure 4 (a). For all measurements the distributions are broad and\ntheir mean values differ from zero. Thus the non-stationary nature of HRV on short\ntime-scales is clearly apparent. Note, that the distributions p(a) for the increments\n\u2206RR are significantly narrower [figure 4 (b)] and that they are very well fitted to a\nnormal distribution; however, the mean values of the slopes differ from zero.\nBecause the dynamics of RR-intervals is evidently non-stationary, we have applied\ndetrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) [10] for estimation of the scaling exponents \u03b2\nfor the apn\u0153a sets {RRi}\nj . In doing so, we adapted the DFA method [10] for short\ntime-series and used non-overlapped windows (see Appendix for details). Because the\ntime-series were short, time windows of length 4\u201315 RR-intervals were used to calculate\n\u03b2. For all measured subjects, this procedure yielded values of \u03b2 lying within the range\n\u03b2 \u2208 (1.3 : 1.7), with a mean value of 1.45. If RR-intervals in the sets {RRi}\nj are\nreplaced by realizations of Brown noise (the integral of white noise) keeping same lengths\nof apn\u0153a intervals, then the calculation gives \u03b2 = 1.46\u00b10.07. Additionally, a surrogate\nanalysis was performed for each subject by random shuffling of the time indices i of\nRRi-intervals, to confirm the importance of time-ordering of the RR-intervals. For\neach realization (set {RRi}\nj), 100 surrogate sets were generated, 100 values of \u03b2 were\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 6\n\u22120.005 0 0.01\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n Slope a [sec\/beat]\n \np(\na)\/\np m\na\nx\n \n (a)\n\u22120.005 0 0.01\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n Slope a [sec\/beat]\n \np(\na)\/\np m\na\nx\n \n (b)\nFigure 4.

Values of \u03b2s for the surrogate sets\nlie in the same limits as those for the original sets, but with a small bias between \u03b2,\ncalculated using original sets, and \u03b2s (see the Appendix for values of \u03b2 and \u03b2s). It means\nthat one can see a correlation between RR-intervals, but that it is weak. Summarizing\nthe DFA results, we can claim that the scaling exponent \u03b2 is similar to that for free\ndiffusion of a Brownian particle, but there is nonetheless some correlation between the\nRR-intervals. We also applied aggregation analysis [19] in a similar manner and arrived\nat qualitatively the same conclusion. Note that in the contrast to the initial idea of the\nDFA and aggregation analyses, which were used for revealing long-range correlations\nin time series, we have used these approaches to analyse the diffusion velocity because\nthey can cope with trends. Long-range correlations cannot be revealed in the described\nmeasurements.\nTo estimate the strength of the correlation, stationary time-series of the increments\n{\u2206RRi}\nj were considered. The autocorrelation function \u03c1(k) was calculated\n\u03c1(k) =\n1\n(M \u2212 1)\u03c3\nN\u2211\nj=1\nmj\u2212k\u2211\ni=1\nR\u0302R\nj\ni R\u0302R\nj\ni\u2212k; (1)\nM =\nN\u2211\nj=1\n(mj \u2212 k), \u03c3 =\n1\nM \u2212 1\nN\u2211\nj=1\nmj\u2212k\u2211\ni=1\n(\nR\u0302R\nj\ni\n)2\n.\nHere R\u0302R\nj\ni = \u2206RR\nj\ni\u2212\u3008\u2206RR\nj\u3009; the brackets \u3008\u3009 denote calculation of the mean value; i and\nj correspond to the heart beat number and apn\u0153a interval respectively, k = 0, 1, . . .,\nmj is the number of increments \u2206RR in the jth apn\u0153a; N is the total number of\napn\u0153a intervals. Figure 5 presents examples of autocorrelation functions. One of\nthem has pronounced oscillations. An approximation of \u03c1(k) by the function \u03c1a(k) =\nexp(\u2212\u03b3k) cos(2pi\u2126k) demonstrates that oscillations occur with frequency near 0.1 Hz,\npresumably corresponding to myogenic processes [17] or (perhaps equivalently) to the\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 7\n0 10 20\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n k\n \n\u03c1(\n k)\n (a)\n0 10 20\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n k\n \n\u03c1(\n k)\n (b)\nFigure 5.

The solid line corresponds to the approximating curve \u03c1a(k) =\nexp(\u2212\u03b3k) cos(2pi\u2126k).\nMayer wave associated with blood pressure feedback [22, 23]. Further investigations via\nthe parametrical spectral analysis for each apn\u0153a interval show that these oscillations\nare of an on-off nature, i.e. observed for parts of the apn\u0153a intervals, and not in all\nof the measurements as can be seen in figure 5 (b). Examples of apn\u0153a intervals\nwith and without oscillations are shown in figure 6. When an oscillatory component is\npresent then its contribution to \u03c1(k) is much weaker than the contribution of the noisy\ncomponent. The latter is characterized by a very short memory as demonstrated by fast\ndecay of \u03c1(k).\nThe properties of \u2206RR can also be characterized by the probability density function\nP (\u2206RR) shown in figure 7 (a). Figure (b) shows the probability density function P (RR)\nof RR-intervals for comparison. Following [24], the \u03b1-stable distribution has been widely\nused to fit the distribution of increments \u2206RR, and strongly non-Gaussian distributions\nwere observed [24]. We perform a similar fitting applying special software [25]. Since\nthe distributions P (\u2206RR) are almost symmetrical, our attention was concentrated on\nthe tails, which were characterized by a stability index \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2]. The case of \u03b1 = 2\ncorresponds to a Gaussian and, if \u03b1 < 2, the tails are wider than Gaussian. Fitting to\nour results yields a stability index \u03b1 \u2208 (1.8 : 2), and the goodness-of-fit test (modified\nKS-test taking into account the weight to the tails [25]) supports the fitting. Note that,\nalthough the autocorrelation function \u03c1(k) cannot be used for the theoretical description\nof an \u03b1-stable process [26], \u03c1(k) is nonetheless applicable for finite time-series.\nIf we consider the same length of realization using a Gaussian random variable\ninstead, we find \u03b1 = 1.99 \u00b1 0.01. It means that the calculations of \u03b1 are very robust.\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 8\n\u22120.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n \n\u2206 \nR\nR\ni [s\nec\n]\n (a)\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\u22120.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n i\n \n\u2206 \nR\nR\ni  \n[se\nc]\n (b)\nFigure 6.

The dashed lines in figure (a) are added\nto reveal oscillations. The middle and upper \u2206RRi time-series are shifted by 0.1 and\n0.2 (sec) accordingly.\nIn addition we carried out a stability test and it too supported the fitting results. The\nobtained values of \u03b1 \u2208 (1.8 : 2) differ significantly from the previously reported values\n\u03b1 \u2208 (1.5 : 1.7) for 24h time-series of RR-intervals [24].\nombining all the results, we conclude that the short-time dynamics of RR-intervals\ncan be described as a stochastic process with stationary increments. This type of\nstochastic processes was discussed by A. N. Kolmogorov [27] and applied to the\ndescription of a number of different problems (see e.g. [28, 29, 30] for further details).\nSo, HRV during apn\u0153a interval cab be presented in the following form\nRRi = RRi\u22121 +\u2206RRi, (2)\nwhere \u2206RRi is a stationary discrete time stochastic process. Note that the DFA\ncalculation excludes a linear trend, which is taken into account in Eq. (2) as non-\nzero mean value of the increments, \u00b5j = \u3008\u2206RRi\u3009j; in general case, \u00b5j is a random\nfunction of jth apn\u0153a interval.

The insets show the same distributions plotted with logarithmic ordinate scales;\nthe circles correspond to P (\u2206RR). The stable distribution in (a) is characterized by\n\u03b1 = 1.86. In (b) the full (blue) line is a Gaussian distribution fitted to the data.\nthen \u03bei corresponds to the non-stationary process (2) with zero mean value of increments.\nIn other words, the superimposed random component of HRV during apn\u0153a intervals\nis described by a non-stationary random process.\nIncrements \u2206RRi are characterized by a random \u03b1-stable process of short memory,\nwith a weak intermittent oscillatory component of frequency \u223c 0.1 Hz. In the zeroth\napproximation the increments can safely be represented by an uncorrelated Gaussian\nrandom process but, in the next approximation, a weak correlation must be included,\nallowing for an intermittent oscillatory component, and for weak non-Gaussianity of\nthe distribution of increments \u2206RR. These additions reveal, on the one hand, that\nthe previously reported observation of a non-Gaussian distribution of increments [24]\nis a property of the intrinsic heart rate regulatory system, but on the other hand,\nthat the scaling ranges of the stability index \u03b1 differ significantly in the presence\nor absence of external perturbations (including respiration) acting on the regulatory\nsystem. Consequently an explanation of the scalings reported in [24, 10] should include\nanalyses of the effect of external perturbations and respiration, and not an analysis of\nheart rate alone.\n3. Discussion\n3.1. Non-stationarity of RR-intervals during apnoea\nThe results presented indicate that there is no firm set point for the heart control system,\nand that the heart rhythm exhibits diffusive behaviour. The slowest dynamics can be\ndescribed by a linear trend during apn\u0153a intervals and its presence can be treated as\na slow regulatory\/adaptation component of the control system. The presence of the\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 10\nslow time-scales is an established property of HRV [31] and their presence, even in the\nabsence of the respiratory perturbation, can be interpreted as an expected property.\nOn short time-scales of order several seconds, HRV shows a diffusive dynamics too.\nIt can be interpreted in two ways. One possibility is that the control system does not\nfirmly trace the base (slow) rhythm, because in case of tracing, short time-fluctuations\nshould \u201cjump\u201d around the base rhythm and, consequently, be stationary. Such a picture\ncorresponds to zero action of the control system if the heart rate is in a \u201csafe\u201d (for the\nwhole cardiovascular system) interval, e.g. RR \u2208 [RRlow : RRhigh]. Another possible\nexplanation could be that the control system is tracing the base rhythm but the short-\ntime fluctuations have a non-stationary character. It is natural to expect that there\ncould be other possible explanations, and additional investigations are needed to reach\nan understanding of the diffusive dynamics on short-time scales.\nIn section 2 it is suggested that we should consider the non-stationarity and diffusive\ndynamics of RR-intervals within the framework of a stochastic process with independent\nincrements. It allows one to consider RR-intervals as realizations of the so-called auto-\nregressive process that is widely used in time-series analysis [32]. It means that the\ndirect spectral estimation of RR-intervals, currently used as one of the basic techniques\n[31], is not applicable here and that one must use the theory of stochastic processes\nwith stationary increments for their spectral decomposition [30]. If in the presence\nof respiration, the short-time stochastic component of HRV preserves non-stationarity\nthen spectral estimation based on RR-intervals is not correct, and increments must be\nused instead. Note, that the properties of short-time fluctuations in the presence of\nrespiration are far from being completely understood.\n3.2. Non-Gaussianity and correlations of increments \u2206RR\nThe theories of both stochastic processes with stationary increments and of auto-\nregressive analysis place some limitations on the analysed time-series. The first approach\nrequires the existence of finite second-order momenta, whereas the second approach\nassumes uncorrelated statistics of increments. Formally, however, non-Gaussianity of the\nincrements distribution means that the second-order momenta do not exist [26], but non-\nGaussianity can still be incorporated into the auto-regressive description [33]. And vice\nversa, the presence of correlations in the increments dynamics requires a modification of\nthe standard auto-regressive approach, and it is one that can be incorporated naturally\ninto the general theory. In the current investigation we ignore these issues. We calculate\nthe auto-correlation function and use model (2), because the finite length of the time-\nseries guarantees the existence of the second-order momenta, and the simplicity of (2)\nmeans that the inclusion of the correlations is a trivial extension.\nOur consideration has the formal character of time-series analysis because we do not\nincorporate any preliminary information about the possible dynamics of RR-intervals.\nThe analysis is based on the use of a set of relatively short time-series, a fact that defines\nour choice of simple statistical measures. One cannot exclude the possibility that the use\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 11\nof other approaches to such data might provide additional insight into HRV dynamics.\nFor example, the fractional Brownian motion approach [19, 34] and the theory of discrete\nnon-stationary non-Markov random process [35] represent different paradigms, which are\nbased on assumptions about the origin of the data. Note, that despite a long history of\ndeveloping the approaches and their applications, the approaches of fractional Brownian\nmotion and of stable random process are not standardized tools, whereas the approach of\nnon-Markov random process is not so popular. There is no definite recipe for choosing\na set of measures which can uniquely specify (or provide a good description of) the\nproperties of a renewal (discrete time) stochastic process.\n3.3. Modelling\nAnother way of attempting to understand the results is to try to reproduce the observed\ndata properties from an appropriate model. In the context of our experiments, the\nmodelling should consist of a simulation of the electrical activity of sinoatrial node\n(SAN) where the heart beats are initiated. For modelling, one option is to use a bottom-\nup approach, which is currently a very popular technique within the framework of the\ncomplexity paradigm. In fact, available SAN cellular models allow one to incorporate\nmany details of physiological processes like the openings and closures of specific ion\nchannels [36]. However, despite the complexity of the models (40\u2013100 variables) many\nimportant features are still missed. For example, the fundamentally stochastic dynamics\nof ion channels is represented by equations that are deterministic. Heterogeneity of the\nSAN cellular locations and intercell communications are among other important open\nissues [37, 38].\nAn alternative option is the top-down approach using integrative phenomenological\nmodels. In contrast to detailed cell models, a toy model of the heart as a whole unit can\nbe developed. It is known that an isolated heart, and a heart in the case of a brain-dead\npatient [39] demonstrate nearly periodic behaviour. So, it is reasonable to assume that\nthe observed HRV is induced by the neuronal heart control system, which is a part of\nthe central nervous system. The control system includes a primary site for regulation\nlocated in the medulla [40], consisting of a set of neural networks with connections to the\nhypothalamus and the cortex. The control is realized via two branches of the nervous\nsystem: the parasympathetic (vagal) and the sympathetic branches. Although many\ndetails of the control system are still missing [41, 20], it is currently accepted that the\nvagal branch operates on faster time scales than the sympathetic one, and that each\nbranch has a specific co-operative action on the heart rate and the dynamics of SAN\ncells.\nLet us consider an integrate-and-fire (IF) model as a model of a SAN cell in the\nleading pacemaker. These cells are responsible for initiating the activity of SAN cells\nand, consequently, that of the whole heart [38]. The dynamics of the IF model describes\nthe membrane potential U(t) of the cell by the following equations\ndU\ndt\n=\n1\n\u03c4\nif U(t) < Ut (4)\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 12\nU(t) = Ur, t\n\u2217 = t if U(t) = Ut and\ndU\ndt\n> 0, (5)\nHere 1\/\u03c4 defines a slope of integration, Ut is the threshold potential, Ur is the resting\n(hyperpolarization) potential; the time t\u2217 corresponds to the cell firing, and it is the\ndifference between two successive firings that determines the instantaneous heart period\nor RR-interval, RRi = t\n\u2217\ni \u2212 t\n\u2217\ni\u22121. It is known [40] that increasing sympathetic activity\nwith a combination of decreasing vagal activity leads to an increase in the heart period,\nand vice versa. Direct stimulation of the sympathetic branch leads to an increase of\nthe integration slope 1\/\u03c4 and a lowering of the threshold potential Ut, whereas vagal\nactivation has the opposite effects, and additionally, lowers the resting potential Ur.\nThus, the neuronal activities can be taken into account as modulations of the parameters\nof the IF model (4). For reproducing HRV during apn\u0153a, therefore, it is enough to\npresent any of the parameters \u03c4 , Ut or Ur as a stochastic variable of the form (2),\nfor example, Ut(t\n\u2217\ni ) = Ut(t\n\u2217\ni\u22121) + \u03bei, where \u03bei are random numbers having the stable\ndistribution.\nHowever, the use of more realistic (than IF) models with oscillatory dynamics, for\nexample Fitzhugh-Nagumo [42] or Morris-Lecar [43] models, makes the reproduction of\nthe experimental results a more difficult but interesting task. Currently it is unclear\nwhether it is possible to obtain a stable distribution of increments by consideration\nof the Gaussian type of fluctuations alone, or whether one should use fluctuations\ncharacterizing by a stable distribution. This point demands further investigation.\n4. Conclusion\nIn summary, our experimental modification of the respiration process reveals that the\nintrinsic dynamics of the heart rate regulatory system exhibits stochastic features and\ncan be viewed as the integrated action of many weakly interacting components. Even on\na short time scale (less then half a minute) the heart rate is non-stationary and exhibits\ndiffusive dynamics with superimposed intermittent \u223c 0.1 Hz oscillations. The intrinsic\ndynamics can be described as a stochastic process with independent increments and\ncan be understood within the framework of many-body dynamics as used in statistical\nphysics. The large number of independent regulatory perturbations produce a noisy\nregulatory background, so that the dynamics of the regulatory rhythm is close to classical\nBrownian motion. However there are indications of non-Gaussianity of increments\nand weak but important correlations on short time-scales. The reproduction of these\nfeatures, especially the non-Gaussianity property, is an open problem even in simple toy\nmodels.\nThese results are important both for understanding the general principles\nof regulation in biological systems, and for modeling cardiovascular dynamics.\nFurthermore, the results presented may possibly lead to a new clinical classification\nof states of the cardiovascular system by analysing the intrinsic dynamics of the heart\ncontrol system as suggested in [20].\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 13\nTable A1.

The signals were digitized\nby a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter with a sampling rate of 2 kHz. The ECG and\nrespiration signals were recorded over 45-60 minutes and time locations of R-peaks in\nthe ECG signals were defined and time intervals between two subsequent R-peaks (the\nso called RR-intervals) are used to form HRV signal.\nRespiration-free intervals were produced by the intermittent respiration, involving\nan alternation between normal breaths and apn\u0153a intervals. The durations of both\nnormal breaths and apn\u0153a intervals were fixed at 30 sec. The respiration signal\nwas used to identify apn\u0153a intervals. Finally, the set of time-series of RR-interval\n{RRi}\nj was formed for each subject; here i = 1, 2 . . . labels the ith RR-intervals, and\nj = 1, 2 . . . labels the jth interval of apn\u0153a. For each interval of apnoea, time series\nof the differential increments \u2206RRi = RRi+1 \u2212 RRi were produced and they also form\na set {\u2206RRi}\nj for each subject. The number of RR-intervals in each apn\u0153a interval\nis different, depending on the heart rate of the subject. The total number of apn\u0153a\nintervals also differ for each subject. The mean heart rate \u3008RR\u3009 during apn\u0153a intervals\nand the total number J of intervals for each measured subject are presented in table\nA1.\nFor the application of the DFA and aggregation analyses we adapted the approaches\ndescribed in [10] and [19], respectively, to treat the available sets of short time series\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 14\n{RRi}\nj .\nThe DFA exponent \u03b2 was calculated in the following way. First, the initial set\n{RRi}\nj was transformed to another set {y(k)}j by the following expression:\ny(k) =\nk\u2211\ni=1\nRRi, (A.1)\nwhere k = 1 . . .Mj and Mj is the number of RR-intervals for jth apnoea interval.\nFor each length n = 4, . . . 15 of time window a set of linear trends {yn(k)}j was\ncalculated (see [10] for details), where yn(k) = k \u00b7 anm + b\nn\nm, m = 1, . . . \u230aMj\/n\u230b,\n\u230ax\u230b = max{n \u2208 Z|n \u2264 x} is the floor function of x. Then a set of scaling function\n{F\u02dc (n)}j was calculated for each value of n by use of the expression\nF\u02dc (n) =\nNj\u2211\nk\n[y(k)\u2212 yn(k)]2, (A.2)\nwhere Nj = \u230aMj\/n\u230b \u00b7 n. Further the scaling functions F (n) were calculated as\nF (n) =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a 1\nN \u2212 1\nJ\u2211\nj=1\nF\u02dcj(n), (A.3)\nwhere J is the number of apnoea intervals for the given subject, N =\n\u2211J\nj=1Nj. Finally,\nthe scaling exponent \u03b2 was determined as a slope of the function log[F (n)] \u221d \u03b2 log(n)\n(see figure A1 (a)). The values of \u03b2 for the different subjects are shown in table A1.\nThe aggregation analysis consists of three steps and the final result is the scaling\nexponent b. The first step is the creation of a set of aggregated time series {zm(k)}\nj for\ndifferent m = 1, . . . 10:\nzm(k) =\nk+m\u2211\ni=k\nRRi, (A.4)\nwhere k = 1, . . .Mj \u2212m. Then a realization zm(k) was formed from the set {zm(k)}\nj:\nzm(k) = {zm(k)}\nj = {zm(k)}\n1, . . . {zm(k)}\nJ . The second step includes the calculation\nof the mean value \u00b5(m) and variance \u03c3(m) of the time-series zm(k):\n\u00b5(m) =\n1\nM\nM\u2211\nk=1\nzm(k), \u03c3(m) =\n1\nM \u2212 1\nM\u2211\nk=1\n[zm(k)\u2212 \u00b5(m)]\n2 , (A.5)\nwhere M is the whole length of time series zm(k). The slope b of the function\nlog[\u03c3(m)] \u221d b log[\u00b5(m)] was calculated in the third step (see figure A1 (b)). The values\nof b for each subject are shown in table A1.\nTo verify the robustness of the calculations of exponents \u03b2 and b we have performed\ncalculations with the same number of RR-intervals as well as the same structure of\napn\u0153a intervals but by using realizations of Brown noise generated by computer. In\nother words, in the procedures described above we replaced {RRi}\nj by {Wi}\nj, where\nWi = Wi\u22121 + 0.2 \u00b7 \u03bei for i = 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Mj , W1 = RR1, and \u03bei are random numbers having\nthe normal distribution with mean zero value and unit variance; the numbers \u03bei are\nIntrinsic dynamics of the heart regulatory systems 15\n4 10 15\n0.01\n0.05\n n\n \nF(\nn)\n (a)\n2 5 10\n0.01\n0.1\n0.5\n \u00b5(m)\n \n\u03c3\n(m\n)\n (b)\nFigure A1.

The calculations with Brown noise gave\n\u03b2 = 1.46 \u00b1 0.07 and b = 1.84 \u00b1 0.04. Here data were merged for all subjects and are\npresented in the form of a mean value \u00b1 its standard deviation. It means that there is a\nsystematic error related to the length and data structure, a general error of calculation\nin respect to the theoretical values for \u03b2 is 0.15 and for b is 0.2. However the standard\ndeviations of the calculated values are rather small and, consequently, we can conclude\nthat our calculations of \u03b2 and b are robust.\nReferences\n[1] Ott E 1993 Chaos in Dynamical Systems (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press)\n[2] Frisch U 1995 Turbulence: The Legacy of A.N.
