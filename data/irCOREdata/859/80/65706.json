Improving access to markets and services \n \nIntroduction \nMuch academic research on transport planning in sub-Saharan Africa has \nconcentrated on rather narrow technical engineering issues and upon roads per se. To \nbe beneficial to a wide sector of the continent\u2019s population, transport planning also \nrequires a detailed understanding of the economic, social and political environments \nin which transport takes place and interventions are made.  In this set of progress \nreports on transport planning in Africa I have picked out some of the principal themes \n- and gaps - in recent transport research from a social science perspective, with a \nparticular emphasis on socio-economic, cultural and political issues. The first report \nlooks broadly at current transport needs and the prospects for improving transport \nservices: the discussion is restricted to road transport due to limitations of space.  The \nsecond report concentrates on gender and transport issues, while the third reviews the \nchallenges of meeting children\u2019s transport needs.  \n \nRoads are not enough \nA good transport system depends not just on suitable path and road infrastructure but \nalso on the availability of appropriate vehicles at the right time and place (Dawson \nand Barwell 1993; Ellis and Hine 1998). Bringing these elements together remains a \nmajor challenge across much of Africa. Low population density compounded by very \nlow economic density (GDP per km squared) results in high cost infrastructure \ninvestments and transport costs for intra-Africa trade, which are estimated to be \nnearly twice those of other developing regions (World Bank 2005:37).  Poor access \nnot only affects trading costs: it is closely linked to diverse aspects of poverty and \nsocial exclusion (Edmonds 1998, Booth et al. 2000).  The specific problems of remote \nand off-road rural areas and the linkages between poverty and remoteness\/difficult \naccess have been emphasised in a number of recent studies (Porter 1997, 2002a, \n2002b, Bird et al. 2002, Stifel et al. 2003, Christiaenson et al. 2003).  By comparison, \nthere has been surprisingly little research on the mobility problems of Africa\u2019s urban \npoor (Bryceson et al. 2003:6, Sohail et al. 2003): an important research gap.   \n \nThe high cost of paved road construction tends to limit most major road interventions \nto the public sector, in Africa as elsewhere. Ministries of transport across Africa are \nstaffed predominantly by civil engineers whose training and expertise is focussed \nprincipally on road construction and maintenance.  Moreover, politics, corruption and \nthe mystique of the paved road continue to encourage a roads focus in national \ntransport strategies.  Decisions regarding which roads to improve or pave may often \nbe more dependent upon political factors than agricultural or other economic potential \nalong the proposed route.  \n \nGood all-season road access linking rural areas with major urban market centres is \ncrucial for encouraging food production for urban markets, for enabling rural \npopulations access to the hospitals, secondary schools, banks, government \ndepartments, NGOs and other higher-level goods and services that are commonly \nconcentrated in such centres, and for allowing urban-based health professionals, \ntraders, bureaucrats, politicians, extension workers, NGO staff and others easy access \nto the rural areas they are expected to serve.   Across most of Africa the deficiencies \n 2 \nin the all-season road network in rural areas are a major constraint on urban-rural \nlinkages. Transport failure associated with poor access is probably the most \nsignificant factor limiting agricultural producer profits from food marketing, with \nconsequent massive implications for income distribution and efforts at poverty \nalleviation (Christiansen et al. 2003). \n \nNigeria provides ample illustration of the roads problem. Despite massive expansion \nof its inter-urban paved road system during the 1970s and early 1980s oil boom, \ninadequate construction quality (corrupt road contractors) and failure to maintain \nroads soon led to severe deterioration (Filani 1993).  Recent studies, commissioned by \nthe Nigerian Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, illustrate the scale of \ncurrent rural access problems and the linkages between poor road access and poverty \n(e.g. Unilag Consult 2001, Transport Studies Unit 2001, Uza et al. 2001).   Many \nAfrican countries arguably face even more intractable problems.   For example, access \nto good roads is always one of, and frequently the, major cited constraint on crop \nmarketing in Zambia in recent reports (e.g. Republic of Zambia 2001: 14, World Bank \n2002: 63).   \n \nThere has been an increasing emphasis among donors on the role that communities \nshould themselves play in feeder road maintenance and improvement in Africa. \nLabour-based methods which offer local employment have been promoted for some \nyears (Larcher 1998, Rogerson 2000, TRL 2003). Malmberg-Calvo (1998) \nemphasises the need to develop an institutional framework for managing and \nfinancing the lowest level of the road\/path network.  She stresses the importance of \nstakeholder involvement and a redefined public-private partnership, whereby local \ngovernments or their agents manage the core roads and communities and farmers' \nassociations choose which roads to 'own' and take responsibility for.  However, \ndefining ownership is likely to be crucial as a precursor to new initiatives in this field \nand the process may be time-consuming.   \n \nTransport services are mostly provided by a myriad of small operators in the private \nsector across Africa. Services tend to be least satisfactory in areas with low \npopulations, traditional agriculture with little paid employment, undeveloped markets \nand poor infrastructure: here transport tends to be expensive, crowded and unsafe with \nlittle diversity of modes, little competition and no \u2018critical mass\u2019 to make it easy to \nbuy and maintain vehicles (Starkey et al. 2001:10-11).  Zambia\u2019s eastern and northern \nprovinces provide a good example of the issues such low population density areas \nface. Distances to market centres reportedly average 40 kms and independent \ntransport is hard to come by since large companies dominate agricultural marketing \nand send their own trucks to collect produce (Ellis and Hine 1998: 34). This takes \naway work from local transporters and contributes to a vicious circle of low demand, \nand infrequent but expensive transport services.  Nijhoff et al (2003: 19-20) note the \nneed for public sector support to transport in smallholder areas in Zambia in the form \nof  help with access to imported spare parts and capital equipment.  The potential role \nfor interventions of this type needs closer examination.   \n \nAccess to fuel at an affordable price is a crucial factor in transportation and politically \nvery sensitive. Fuel costs commonly account for 10-40% of overall vehicle operating \ncosts (Starkey et al. 2001: 37) and thus price increases are a common cause of public \nprotest. High fuel taxes are a common cause of high vehicle operating costs (see \n 3 \nBenmaamar 2002 re Uganda Farrington and Saasa 2002: vi re Zambia, where fuel \ntaxation accounted for approximately 70% of the pump price).  In Africa\u2019s many non-\noil producing countries, fuel conservation is an important issue: this suggests the \nvalue of increased use of non-motorised transport, discussed below.  \n \nTransport planning approaches \nThere has been growing interest in the development of a more integrated local-level \napproach to rural transport planning in Africa over the last two decades.  The \nevidence accumulated from a series of individual studies conducted over the 1980s \nand early 90s in Africa and Asia (mostly supported by the ILO or the World Bank\u2019s \nSub-Saharan Africa Transport Policy Program (SSATP)), has emphasised the need for \na more joined-up approach which focuses on access through an examination of \nmobility and proximity conditions rather than transport per se. This has encouraged \nthe development of tools known as Accessibility Planning (AP) or Integrated Rural \nAccessibility Planning (IRAP) which offer a means of identifying accessibility \nproblems among rural households and prioritising interventions i.e. a combination of \ntransport planning with broader rural planning (Edmonds 1998, Sarkar and Ghosh \n2000). However, there are always dangers that over-dependence on a formulaic \napproach, without adequate attention to less easily quantifiable data, can reduce the \nvalue of such exercises.   \n \nOther recent efforts aimed at a more holistic approach to mobility have drawn on the \nSustainable Livelihoods Approach.  Bryceson et al. (2003) use this framework to \nprovide evidence regarding social and economic benefits and disbenefits of mobility, \nwith particular reference to rural-urban linkages, while Sohail et al. (2003) use it to \nexamine access to public transport in three urban contexts, including one in Africa \n(Dar es Salaam). Bryceson et al. (2003) provide evidence from detailed household \nsurveys of different settlement types in Zimbabwe and Uganda to show how mobility \nvaries with income.  This study emphasises that poor people rely far less on motorised \ntransport than medium and high income groups, and suggests the need to strengthen \nnon-motorised forms of transport that the poor can afford.  It also draws attention to \nthe role that transport provision plays as a form of employment for the poor. This \nlabour-absorption point also emerges strongly in a series of recent market access case \nstudies in Nigeria (Nigerian Marketing Network, 2005) and from recent country case \nstudies of transport policy (World Bank 2003).  \n \nA greater role for Intermediate Means of Transport (IMTs)? \nIMTs are \u2018local transport solutions that increase transport capacity and reduce \ndrudgery at a relatively low capital cost\u2019 (Starkey 2001:vii).  They are intermediate in \nthe sense of filling the gap between human walking, headloading and large-scale \ntransport, not merely equipment at an intermediate stage of technical evolution (ibid). \nIMTs of various types can facilitate transport of small to medium loads and\/or \npersonal travel along poor\/narrow tracks. These attributes are potentially of massive \nsignificance for both intra- and inter-village trip-making.  \n \nAlthough donors have recognised the potential of IMTs such as bicycles, wheel-\nbarrow water carriers, ox-carts and suchlike in sub-Saharan Africa since the late \n1980s, only recently has this resulted in more concerted programmes of research and \ndevelopment (Starkey 2001, White et al. 2000).  Adoption of IMTs in rural Africa has \nbeen much lower than in Asia due to a wide range of factors including lower \n 4 \npopulation densities, longer distances to markets, low agricultural incomes, limited \naccess to non-agricultural income sources, and the generally weak industrial base, as \nwell as institutional and cultural factors (Ellis 1997).  The tendency to sidetrack \nwomen in IMT projects is discussed in my second progress report.  In some countries \n(such as Kenya) reduced taxation on bicycles has had a major impact on uptake, \nwhereas in others (such as Zambia) taxation remains a major impediment (Gauthier \nand Hook 2005).  Nonetheless, there is a tendency among government staff at all \nlevels to view IMTs as merely (backward) technology for backward areas.  The \nconcept of a 'critical mass' of adopters is often of particular importance in IMT uptake \n(Starkey 2001:31): this affects maintenance and repair service availability as well as \ncultural acceptability.   \n \nIMT promotion programmes in Africa have often suffered from factors such as \nprovision of inappropriate or poor-quality equipment (as in the case of cycle trailers \nintroduced under the Village Infrastructure Project in Ghana), poor state of paths, high \ncapital cost, lack of suitable finance\/credit schemes, lack of consumer appeal and \nissues around group ownership (I.T. Transport 2003, Porter 2003, Porter and Lyon \n2006).  From this perspective, the spontaneous development of bicycle-taxi and \nmotorcycle-taxi services in diverse locations across Africa in recent years is \nparticularly instructive.  Low cost bicycles and motorcyles imported from China and \nIndia appear to have enormous potential for improving access in areas as diverse as \ncongested urban areas and remote off-road areas and, by doing so, providing \nlivelihoods for the very poor (see Guyer 1997, Yunusa 1999, Fasakin 2001, Porter \n2002b, on Nigeria; Iga 2002 and Bryceson et al. 2003 on Uganda; Okoth 2005 on \nKenya; Lopes 2005 on Angola).  Although these services arguably present significant \nproblems in terms of accident rates and environmental pollution, their flexibility gives \nthem considerable advantages over conventional services (Howe and Bryceson 2000).  \n \nRegulation and corruption in the transport sector  \nAlthough governance and regulation issues are critical to effective performance of the \ntransport sector in Africa, there has been little research in this field. This is a major \nomission, given the levels of corruption reputed to characterise transport \ninfrastructure provision (from selection of routes to award of road contracts, actual \nversus contract road construction specifications, etc.) and the corruption and rent-\nseeking practices widely in evidence across Africa\u2019s road transport system (from \ndriving licence issue and bribe-seeking traffic police and vehicle inspection officers, \nto lorry park and loading restrictions).   A few studies give some indication of the \nscale of the problem. The way transport unions can restrict the development of \nefficient and inexpensive transport services is well illustrated by Fouracre et al. (1994) \nfor Ghana and Benmaamar (2002) for Uganda.  Rizzo (2002) presents a fascinating \nstudy of the negative impacts of privatisation and deregulation in the Dar es Salaam \ntransport system, including the rent-seeking practices of the bus owners\u2019 association. \nGore and Pratten (2002) observe how struggles around control of lorry parks have \nbeen exacerbated in Nigeria by the expansion of youth gangs.  Roadside inspections \nby numerous administrative bodies are often a major cause of delays and charges and \ndo little to improve the dangerous, un-roadworthy condition of many vehicles \n(Nigerian Marketing Network 2005).  In oil-rich Nigeria, the sensitive political issue \nof petroleum shortages created by supplier cartels has only recently been resolved.  As \nSohail et al (2003:38) emphasise, regulation processes must be carried out in a \ndemonstrably transparent way, \u2018since regulation combined with corruption can \n 5 \nproduce a worse situation than an unregulated market\u2019.  This is an area worthy of \nmuch greater attention. \n \nConclusion: future prospects \nAlthough multilateral donors and national governments continued to support \nexpansion and maintenance of the road transport network in Africa in the 1980s and \n1990s, bilateral donors became increasingly wary of major capital investments in \nAfrica\u2019s transport sector, as issues of inadequate maintenance, inadequate institutions, \ningrained corruption and negative consequences for the poor became increasingly and \nembarrassingly apparent. More recently, however, there seems to have been a \nreassessment of transport as a component in development assistance. Although the \nMillennium Goals do not relate directly to transport, transport improvements are \nclearly essential to their achievement.   \n \nThe current donor emphasis on pro-poor growth encourages renewed attention to \ntransport issues, given the linkages now established been poverty-reduction and off-\nfarm employment (Bryceson 2002; DFID 2002), the consequent significance of rural-\nurban interactions and the potential for labour-based road construction, maintenance \nand transport services themselves to provide employment for the poor.   The move to \nbilateral donor budgetary support to governments similarly supports the renewed \nemphasis on infrastructure, given African governments\u2019 infrastructure priorities. The \nreport of the Commission for Africa (2005) indicates that transport is firmly back on \nthe agenda \u2013 indeed, Maxwell (2005:485) suggests that \u2018rediscovery of infrastructure \nis probably the biggest single development story of 2005\u2019.  The World Bank Group \nAction Plan (2005:viii) gives further confirmation, presenting transport as an \nimportant component in action to close the infrastructure gap: notably \u2018rehabilitation \nof road networks and reform programs to establish independent financing and \nmanagement mechanisms\u2019.  Roads are emphasised in this document as crucial to \nagricultural productivity and connecting markets to the poor, with a proposed action \nto increase investments in rural roads, starting with feeder roads by 20% per annum \n(ibid 46). \n \nUnfortunately, as the World Bank SSATP (2003:11) notes, it is \u2018still much easier to \nexplain\u2026 the \u2018contribution\u2019 of the transport sector in terms of deliverables, such as \nnumbers of kilometers of road rehabilitated\u2026 or the provision of IMTs, than in terms \nof improved access and mobility, especially related to the needs of particular groups \nand sectors\u2019. The diversity of transport needs among different groups of poor people \nis still not adequately understood (Booth et al. 2000: 46).  It is to be hoped that, as \nthese new plans roll forward, they will develop a strong focus on such less tangible \nissues.  \n \nReferences \nBenmaamar, M.
