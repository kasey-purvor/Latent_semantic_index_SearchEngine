Milner and Goodale have suggested that the \nventral stream is dedicated for processing vision for perception and the dorsal \nstream vision for action (Milner and Goodale, The visual brain in action, 1995). \nHowever, it is possible that on-going processes in the visuomotor stream will \nnevertheless have an effect on perceptual processes. This possibility was \nexamined in the present study. We have examined the visual form-discrimination \nperformance of the form-agnosic patient D.F. with and without a concurrent \nvisuomotor task, and found that her performance was significantly improved in \nthe former condition. This suggests that the visuomotor behaviour provides cues \nwhich enhance her ability to recognize the form of the target object. In control \nexperiments we have ruled out proprioceptive and efferent cues, and therefore \npropose that D.F. can to a significant degree access the object\u201fs visuomotor \nrepresentation in the dorsal stream. Moreover, we show that the grasping-\ninduced perceptual improvement disappears if the target objects only differ with \nrespect to their shape but not their width. This suggests that shape information \nper se is not used for this grasping task. \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nIt is now well-established that the visual areas of the cerebral cortex are divided \ninto two visual streams: the ventral and the dorsal stream (Ungerleider and \nMishkin, 1982; Van Essen, 2005). According to Milner and Goodale (1995) the \nventral stream processes visual information for perceptual purposes. The dorsal \nstream in contrast uses visual information to guide action (visuomotor stream). \nThis distinction is based largely on studies with the form-agnosic patient D.F. \n(Goodale and Milner, 2004). She suffered extensive lesions to her ventral stream \n(Milner et al., 1991; James et al., 2003), which left her almost unable to \ndiscriminate visual forms (Milner et al., 1991). However, in grasping studies she \nshowed an implicit ability to adjust her grasp aperture to the different forms of \nvisually presented objects (Goodale et al., 1991). These and similar observations \nprovided support for the two-visual stream framework (Goodale and Milner, 1992; \nJeannerod and Rossetti, 1993; Goodale and Milner, 2004).  \n \nOne aspect of D.F.\u201fs behaviour, which is puzzling in this context, is her apparent \ninability to use the visual information available to her visuomotor stream directly \nto improve her performance in perceptual tasks. It is obvious that her \nperformance in perceptual tasks is worse than her performance in visuomotor \ntasks (Goodale et al., 1991; Milner et al., 1991). But the reason for this is not \nclear. One explanation would be that the two streams are not connected. \nHowever, there is evidence that such anatomical connections do exist (Felleman \n 4 \nand Van Essen, 1991). A second explanation might be to assume that D.F.\u201fs \nlesion also destroyed these connections.  \n \nA third possible explanation could be that the relevant information in the dorsal \nstream is only available in the context of a concurrent visuomotor task. If that \nwere true, we would predict that D.F.\u201fs shape-discrimination performance should \nimprove in the context of a relevant visuomotor task. This prediction was tested \nin a study by Murphy et al. (1996). They found that D.F.\u201fs shape discrimination \ndid improve during a grasping task, but the possibility that proprioceptive or \nefferent cues rather than visual cues helped D.F. in this condition could not be \nexcluded, and indeed were proposed as the explanation. We revisited this \nquestion but included conditions which allowed us to compare the contributions \nof proprioceptive, efferent and visual cues to D.F.\u201fs shape-discrimination \nperformance in the context of visuomotor tasks. We also examined whether D.F. \nrelied on form or size information by including a condition where only form but no \nsize cues were available.  \n \nOur rationale for performing these experiments was that by studying D.F., we \nmight be able to uncover interactions between the two visual streams that would \nnot be measurable in healthy subjects, whose shape recognition is at ceiling. In \nD.F., the higher levels of the ventral stream have been deprived of their normal \ninput from earlier shape areas, due to the severe damage sustained by area LO.  \n 5 \nOur hypothesis was that D.F. might be able to gain access to the products of \nobject processing in the dorsal stream.  \n \nMaterials and Methods \nSubjects. Patient D.F. suffered a carbon monoxide intoxication in 1988 which led \nto extensive bilateral brain damage (Milner et al., 1991). During a recent MRI \nexamination it was found that her brain lesions are mostly confined to the ventral \nlateral occipital cortex, comprising in both hemispheres parts of Brodmann areas \n18 and 19, but largely excluding V1 and the fusiform gyrus (James et al., 2003). \nThe site of her lesions match very well the site of area LO (the lateral occipital \narea) (Malach et al., 1995; Kanwisher et al., 1996; Kourtzi and Kanwisher, 2000; \nGrill-Spector et al., 2001). Area LO has been identified by fMRI studies as \nimportant for visual object recognition (James et al., 2000; Kourtzi et al., 2003; \nStanley and Rubin, 2003; Ferber et al., 2005). D.F. suffers from visual form \nagnosia, i.e. she has trouble discriminating between different visual shapes, \nforms, orientations and distances. Apart from that her perceptual abilities are \nlargely intact, e.g. she has normal visual acuity, and relatively good luminance, \ncolour, and texture perception (Milner et al., 1991). At the time of testing she was \n50 years old. Five healthy, age-matched women (mean age: 51.2, SD: 7.7) \nserved as control subjects. All subjects were right-handed by self-report. All \nexperiments were undertaken with the understanding and written consent of \neach subject. The study conforms with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical \n 6 \nAssociation (Declaration of Helsinki), as printed in the British Medical Journal (18 \nJuly 1964).  \n \nExperimental Procedures. Five experiments were carried out. Common to all \nexperiments was a shape discrimination task, i.e. subjects had to report verbally \nwhether the target object was a square or a rectangle. An overview of the five \ndifferent experiments is presented in Table 1. The setup for the experiments is \nillustrated in Fig. 1.  \n \nThe first experiment served as the baseline task for the other experiments. It \nwas a simple shape discrimination task. No concurrent motor task was used. \nSubjects were wearing LC shutter glasses (Plato Inc., Toronto, Canada), which \nwere closed before the beginning of each trial, and opened at the start of the trial. \nThe LC shutter glasses remained open for 2 s, and remained closed until the \nstart of the next trial. The target objects were presented standing upright at a \ndistance of 50 cm. The square object had a width of 6.50 cm, and the rectangular \nobject had a width of 7.27 and height of 5.81 cm, corresponding to an aspect \nratio of 80%. Depth of all objects was 1.5 cm. Surface area of both objects was \nidentical. These objects were chosen because previous experiments with D.F. \nhad shown that she was unable to discriminate between them. The purpose of \nExperiment 1 was to confirm these earlier findings. The square was used for one \nhalf of the trials; different trials were intermingled in a random sequence; a total \nof 130 trials were presented.  \n 7 \n \nExperiment 2 combined the shape-discrimination task with a grasping \nmovement. Subjects had to grasp the target object with their right hand and call \nout the shape of the object during the movement. Subjects were asked to use a \nprecision grip, i.e. to pick up the object with thumb and index finger. The \nsequence of events was similar to that in Experiment 1. The LC shutter glasses \nopened at the start of the trial, and closed at the onset of the hand movement, \ni.e. the release of the start button. In some of the trials the target object was \nmoved out of reach before the subject could contact the object. This was done \nusing a system developed for catching studies (Schenk et al., 2000). This system \nuses two motor-driven linear axes moving a sledge which carries a magnet. The \nsledge can move along any trajectory along the horizontal plane. The axes and \nthe sledge are covered by a steel plate. The target object sits on a magnetic \ncarrier on top of the steel plate, and thus follows the movements of the magnet \nbelow the steel plate. This system is connected to a pair of photosensors. In our \nexperiments, the photosensors were triggered when the subject\u201fs hand came \nwithin 20 cm of the target object, the signal from the photosensors then triggering \nthe onset of object motion, thus putting the target object beyond the subject\u201fs \nreach. For this purpose the object was accelerated at 7 m\/s2 for 25 cm, reaching \na halt at a distance of 1 m. These trials were called \u201cnon-contact\u201d trials and were \nintroduced to ensure that subjects could not use haptic information to guide their \ndecision on the shape of the target object. Only results from the non-contact trials \nwere used in our analysis. These trials were intermingled with contact trials, \n 8 \nwhere the object did not move, and subjects were thus able to contact and pick \nup the object. Half of the trials were non-contact trials. In the case of both contact \nand non-contact trials, half of the trials used the square objects. A total of 260 \ntrials were presented to the subjects in this experiment. The hand movement was \nmeasured using a 3D movement registration system (Fa. Zebris, Tuebingen, \nGermany). Two markers were attached to the nails of the index finger and thumb \nof the right hand. Data were recorded with a sampling frequency of 50 Hz.  \n \nIn Experiment 3 we tested the possibility that proprioceptive or efferent \ninformation from the grasping movement might be used to facilitate the shape-\ndiscrimination performance. In particular we were interested in the contribution of \nproprioceptive or efferent information from the peak hand aperture, because this \nis the parameter of the grasping movement most closely linked to the shape of \nthe target object (Paulignan et al., 1991; Rosenbaum, 1991; Hoff and Arbib, \n1993; Jeannerod, 1996; Smeets and Brenner, 1999). Proprioceptive information \nwas excluded by asking subjects to call out the shape just before the start of their \nmovement. This was achieved by a series of tones which were identical in \nduration and frequency. The first tone, which occurred 1 s after the start of the \ntrial, prompted the subject to name the shape of the object, and the second tone, \nwhich occurred after another 1 s, prompted the subject to start the hand \nmovement. Trials where the subject either named the object after the second \ntone, or started the movement before the second tone, were discarded and \nrepeated in random order at the end of the experiment. Because the shape \n 9 \ndiscrimination response in this experiment was concluded before the start of the \nhand movement, any haptic information about the shape that the subject might \nhave obtained would have come too late to influence the discrimination \nresponse. For this reason there was no need for non-contact trials in this \nexperiment. The role of efferent cues was addressed by comparing the accuracy \nof D.F.\u201fs verbal report and her grip adjustment. We assumed that if efference \ninformation guided her verbal report then there should be a close link between \nthe accuracy of her report and the accuracy of her motor response (i.e. the peak \ngrip aperture). To manipulate the accuracy of the motor response we asked D.F. \nand the other subjects to use different hands for different trials. Subjects were \ninformed before the start of the trial that they should either use the right, left or \nboth hands. In a third of the trials the right hand was to be used, in another third \nthe left, and in the remaining trials, subjects were asked to use the index fingers \nof the two hands together to pick up the object. To measure the movements of \nboth hands four markers were attached to the index finger and thumb of both \nhands. A total of 390 trials were performed by the subjects in this experiment. \n \nExperiment 4 was designed to explore the relationship between the motor task \nand the improvement in perceptual performance. In particular this experiment \naddressed the question of whether a non-specific activity-related attentional \nenhancement might be sufficient to explain the improved perceptual \nimprovement observed in Experiments 2 and 3. If this explanation were correct, \nwe would expect that any concurrent motor activity would lead to improved shape \n 10 \ndiscrimination. A pointing task was chosen because although very similar to the \ngrasping task, it is different in that size and shape of the object are not strictly \nrelevant for performance of the task. In all other respects this experiment was \nidentical to Experiment 2.  \n \nExperiment 5 is a variation of Experiment 2 (i.e. a combination of a shape-\ndiscrimination and a grasping task). In this experiment we examined which \nspecific aspect of the target object is used as a cue for the shape discrimination \ntask. In Experiment 2 and 3 shape and size information were confounded. In \nExperiment 5 these two aspects were disentangled by using target objects of \nidentical width, but different shape. In this case size or width could not be used to \ndiscriminate between the shapes. Two pairs of objects were used. The first pair \nof objects had a width of 7.27 cm; the second pair of objects had a width of 8.16 \ncm. Each pair comprised a rectangle with a width:height ratio of 5:4 (using \nheights of 5.81 cm and 6.52 in the first and second pair respectively), and a \nsquare (i.e. height and width identical). To obtain equal numbers of trials for each \nspecific object, we used 32 trials per object and trial type (i.e. non-contact versus \ncontact trials) leading to 128 non-contact trials, and thus 256 trials in total. \n \nEach subject took part in three sessions. Each session lasted for approximately \n90 minutes with a break of 10 minutes after the first 45 minutes. The five \nexperiments were repeated in each session in a different sequence.  \n \n 11 \nAnalysis and statistics. Since control subjects performed the shape \ndiscrimination task in all five experiments without error, only D.F.\u201fs results were \nsubjected to a formal analysis. As is the case in the analysis of most single-case \nstudies, trials were treated as cases. Thus the sample of cases which could be \nused for each experiment ranged between 128 and 130 trials, which means that \na normal distribution could be assumed for the statistical analysis. In general, we \nadopted a significance threshold of 5%; however, in the case of multiple \ncomparisons, we used a Bonferroni correction (when available) or a stricter \nthreshold of 1%. \nFor the analysis of DF\u2019s verbal responses, binomial tests were used to check \nwhether the number of correct verbal responses differed significantly from \nchance. To compare proportions of correct responses across tasks we used \u03c72 \ntests.  \nFor the analysis of DF\u2019s grasping response in Experiment 2 and 3, we first \nsmoothed the kinematic traces using a non-parametric Kernel filter (Marquardt \nand Mai, 1994) and then determined the peak grip aperture for each trial in each \nhand condition. Grip aperture refers to the three-dimensional distance between \nthe two digits that were used in the grasp (namely index and thumb in the case of \nunimanual grasps, or index fingers of the two hands, in the case of bimanual \ngrasps). We used a two-factor between-subject ANOVA to examine the effects of \nobject shape (i.e. square versus rectangle) and hand (i.e. right, left, both) on \nmaximum grip aperture. Independent-sample t-tests were used for specific \ncomparisons.  \n 12 \n \nTo compare the verbal and the grasping response in Experiment 2 and 3, \nwe first transformed the values of the two response types into a common format. \nFor this purpose, d\u201f values were computed for both response types. The \nparameter d\u201f corresponds to the distance between the z-transformed distribution \nof the responses for two different categories (i.e. in our case square versus \nrectangle). It is thus a measure of the accuracy with which it is possible to \ndiscriminate between the two categories on the basis of the obtained responses \n(Gescheider, 1997: see pp. 116-124). To obtain d' values for both response types \nwe used the formulae (5.3-5.6) provided by Gescheider (1997: pp. 118-119). In \nthe case of the discriminative (verbal) response, d' was computed on the basis of \nthe proportion of correct and incorrect responses, while in the case of the motor \nresponse, the means of the peak grip aperture for squares and rectangles, and \ntheir standard deviations, were used to calculate d'.  \n \nAlthough d\u201f is the conventional parameter used to measure and compare \ndiscrimination performance, it has the disadvantage that only one value per \ncondition is computed, and thus no statistical comparison is possible. Therefore, \nas an alternative approach to comparing verbal and motor responses, we also \ncomputed expected proportions of correct responses on the basis of the motor \nresponse. This allowed us to employ \u03c72 tests to test whether the actually obtained \nproportion of correct responses differed significantly from those proportions \nwhich were expected if D.F. had based her response on the maximum grip \n 13 \naperture used during the grasping response. For the calculation of the expected \nproportion, we assumed that D.F. would need to adopt a criterion value for the \npeak grip aperture and then compare the maximum grip aperture in each trial to \ndecide whether this response was targeted at the square (maximum grip \naperture below the criterion value) or the rectangle (maximum grip aperture \nabove the criterion value). In order to make the comparison between verbal and \nmotor responses as conservative as possible, we assumed that D.F. would have \nused the optimal criterion (i.e. the criterion that would have yielded the highest \nnumber of correct responses): Both the d' calculations and the computation of \nexpected proportions were conducted for all three hand conditions.  \n \nTable 1 and Figure 1 about here \n \n \nResults \nIt should be noted that all control subjects performed the shape-discrimination \ntask without error in all five experiments. Accordingly we will restrict our \npresentation of the results to those obtained in patient D.F. \n \nExperiment 1:  D.F.\u201fs ability to discriminate between a square and a rectangle \nwas at chance in this purely perceptual task (49.2%, see Fig. 2).  \nExperiment 2: Verbal performance: In this experiment, she was asked to name \nthe shape while she was reaching forward to pick up the object. In this condition \n 14 \nher ability to recognize the shape improved significantly above chance (75%: p \n<0.0001, see Fig. 2).  \nRelation between motor and verbal performance: To compare D.F.\u201fs motor \nand verbal performance we used two approaches. First, we transformed both the \ngrip aperture and the results from the verbal report into d' measures. We found \nthat d' (d'=1.34) based on her verbal report was substantially higher than that \nbased on her grip apertures (d'=0.58). Secondly, we also computed the \nproportion of correct responses that would be expected if D.F. had used the \nwidth of her maximal grip aperture to determine the shape of the object. Again, \nwe found that the number of correct responses which was actually obtained in \nher verbal report (75%) was significantly higher (\u03c72(1)=4.56; p =0.033) than the \nproportion of correct responses which was expected on the basis of the \ndistribution of her grip apertures (62%). In summary, this suggests that \nproprioceptive or efferent information about the grip aperture cannot explain the \nhigh accuracy of D.F.\u201fs verbal discrimination performance in this condition.  \n \nFigure 2 about here \n \nExperiment 3: The purpose of this experiment was to test whether \nproprioceptive or efferent information about the peak grip aperture used for a \nspecific object could explain why D.F.\u201fs shape discrimination performance was \nbetter during the grasping task. To explore the role of proprioceptive information, \nD.F.\u201fs shape discrimination performance in Experiment 3 (no proprioceptive \n 15 \ninformation available) was compared to her discriminative performance in \nExperiment 2 (proprioceptive information available). To explore the role of \nefferent information, we examined the relationship between the accuracy of \nD.F.\u201fs verbal report on the shape and the accuracy with which she adjusted her \ngrip aperture to the differently shaped objects in the three different hand \nconditions (right, left, both hands). We will first describe her performance on the \nverbal shape-discrimination task, and then present the findings on grip aperture. \nFinally we will examine how the differences in motor performance obtained for \nthe three different hand conditions relate to D.F.\u201fs verbal performance in those \nconditions.  \n \nVerbal performance:  DF\u201fs shape-discrimination ability was significantly above \nchance irrespective of the hand with which she tried to grasp the object (p < \n0.0001 for right, left and both hands). Of particular importance is her performance \nin the right-hand condition. This performance can be compared directly to her \nperformance in Experiment 2, where it was also the right hand that was used. \nHowever, in contrast to Experiment 2, where proprioceptive information was \ngenerally available, this information was unavailable in Experiment 3, because \nthe verbal response was given before the start of the movement. Nevertheless \nD.F.\u201fs shape-discrimination performance was not significantly different in the two \nexperiments (X2(1)=0.52; p>0.40, see Fig. 2). This suggests that D.F. did not use \nproprioceptive information. The finding of above-chance shape discrimination in \nthis condition also seems to suggest that the planning of a grasping movement is \n 16 \nsufficient to trigger an improved perceptual performance. With respect to the \nquestion of whether D.F. might have used efferent information, it is interesting to \nnote that her discrimination performance is worst in the bimanual condition (see \nFig. 5). However, this is the very condition in which her grip is most differentiated \nfor different object shapes (cf. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). This suggests that there is a \npoor correlation between D.F.\u201fs verbal and motor performance, and thus little \nsupport for the idea that she used efferent information for the shape \ndiscrimination task. This will be explored further by means of a formal \ncomparison of D.F.\u201fs motor and verbal performance (see below).  \n \nPeak grip aperture: To examine the effect of hand and shape on peak grip \naperture, an ANOVA with hand (right, left, both hands) and shape (square versus \nrectangle) as between-subject factors was carried out. Both factors, shape \n[F(1\/384)=19.98; p<0.0001] and hand [F(2\/348)=715.14; p <0.0001] produced \nsignificant main effects. The effect of shape reflects a slightly bigger grip aperture \nfor the rectangle (139 mm) than for the square (134 mm). The effect of hand is \nproduced by a significant bigger grip aperture for the bimanual condition (162 \nmm) than for both the right hand (124 mm) and the left hand condition (123 mm). \nInterestingly, we also obtained a significant interaction between shape and hand. \nThis interaction effect can be explained by the fact that a significant difference \nbetween the square and rectangle condition is only obtained in the bimanual \ncondition [t(128)=4.375; p < 0.001]. In the right-hand condition the difference \napproached significance, but did not satisfy the more stringent significance \n 17 \ncriteria of 1% adopted for post-hoc comparisons. In the left-hand condition, the \npeak grip aperture for the square and rectangle were not significantly different \nform each other (t(128)=0.032; p >0.50). These results are illustrated in Figures 3 \nand 4.  \n \nFigures 3 and 4 about here \n \nRelation between motor and verbal performance: Again we computed d' and \nthe expected proportion of correct responses on the basis of the obtained \ndistribution of grip apertures to compare D.F.\u201fs motor and verbal performance in \nthis experiment. As can be seen in Fig. 5a, d' based on the verbal report is \nconsistently higher than that based on grip aperture. This indicates that the \nshape discrimination performance obtained in verbal report is higher than what \ncould be expected purely on the basis of the grip aperture information. Secondly, \nwe also computed the proportion of correct responses that would be expected if \nD.F. had used the width of her maximal grip aperture to determine the shape of \nthe object. Again, we found that the number of correct responses which would be \nexpected on this basis was, at least in two out of three conditions, significantly \nsmaller than the proportion of correct responses which were actually obtained \n(right hand: expected proportion: 60%; actual proportion: 78%; \u03c72(1)=9.53; p \n=0.0021; left hand: expected proportion: 58%; actual proportion: 71%; \n\u03c72(1)=4.83; p =0.028; see Fig. 5b). In fact in the case of left-hand trials, we would \npredict that on the basis of D.F.\u201fs grip aperture values, her shape-discrimination \n 18 \nability would not be significantly different from chance, when in fact her \nperformance was clearly above chance (p < 0.0001). Taken together our findings \nsuggest that D.F.\u201fs superior shape discrimination in association with grasping \ncannot be explained by her use of proprioceptive or efferent cues from her \ngrasping responses.  \nFigure 5 about here \n \nExperiment 4: To test whether D.F.\u201fs improvement of shape discrimination \nfound during the grasping task was specific to grasping, we repeated Experiment \n2 in a modified version, asking her to point to, rather than grasp, the target \nobject. In this case her discrimination performance was not significantly above \nchance (p =0.188). The essential difference between the grasping and the \npointing task is that while aspects of the object\u201fs shape, namely its width, have to \nbe processed for grasping, they are not needed for pointing. Experiment 5: \nGiven that during grasping it is actually the object\u201fs width and not its shape per \nse that is used to guide the grasping response, we examined whether D.F.\u201fs \nability to discriminate shapes would also improve in a condition where the \ngrasping movement is directed towards objects of different shape but identical \nwidth. It turned out that in this condition DF\u201fs ability to discriminate between the \ntwo shapes was at chance (p =0.331).  \n \n 19 \nDiscussion \nOur results indicate that the dorsal representation of visual object information in \npatient D.F. can influence her ability to distinguish shapes. This is implied by the \nfinding that D.F.\u201fs ability to discriminate different shapes is significantly improved \nin the context of a grasping task. This finding suggests that during the grasping \ntask information about the shape which was previously inaccessible to D.F. \nbecomes now available. However, before we come to the conclusion that it is \nvisuomotor information from the dorsal stream which supports this improvement, \nwe need to rule out other possible sources of information which also become \navailable during the grasping movement and might have helped in identifying the \nshape of the target objects. These additional sources of information are \nproprioceptive and efferent cues.  \n \nThe results from Experiment 3 indicate that neither proprioceptive nor efferent \ncues can explain D.F.\u201fs superior shape discrimination performance during the \ngrasping task. The relevance of proprioceptive cues can be ruled out on the \nbasis of the finding that D.F.\u201fs ability to discriminate between shapes is not \ndiminished in a condition where she has to name the shape first and move \nafterwards. In this condition, proprioceptive information is not available during the \nshape discrimination task. Nevertheless D.F. might have already planned the \ngrasping movement at that stage, and this means that in principle efferent \ninformation from the grasp might have been available. However, since the \nefferent information is just a copy of the motor commands that actually determine \n 20 \nthe grasping movement, one might expect that the information contained within \nthe efferent copy is closely related to the characteristics of the actual formation of \nthe grip. Accordingly, it would be expected that in this case the accuracy of D.F.\u201fs \nverbal report would be closely related to the accuracy of her grip formation. \nHowever, D.F.\u201fs verbal accuracy in recognizing the shape of the object was \nconsistently and significantly higher than the accuracy of her grip formation. This \ndissociation was most striking in the case of left-hand grasping. Here her grip \napertures when reaching for the square and the rectangle were practically \nidentical, but her verbal report nevertheless showed that she could quite reliably \ndiscriminate between the two objects. In conclusion, these findings suggest that \nD.F.\u201fs improved shape discrimination performance during the grasping task was \nbased neither on proprioceptive nor on efferent information. This conclusion is \nquite different from that of previous studies, which examined the effect of \nmovement cues on the perceptual performance of patients with visual form \nagnosia. In those earlier studies proprioceptive and efferent cues could not be \nruled out, and therefore the observed perceptual improvements were always \nattributable to the patient\u201fs use of non-visual motor cues (Dijkerman and Milner, \n1997; Goldstein and Gelb, 1918; Landis et al., 1982; Murphy et al., 1996).  \n \nThere is one further alternative explanation, which is worth considering, namely \nthat the improvements observed during the grasping task are induced by \nattentional changes. It is well-established that motor activity or even action-\nrelated visual stimuli can improve performance of patients with attentional \n 21 \ndeficits, most notably in patients with spatial neglect (Robertson et al., 1995; \nHumphreys and Riddoch, 2001; Humphreys, 2004). It should be noted that this \naccount would need to assume that the attentional effects are fairly specific, \notherwise it could not explain why other motor tasks (i.e. pointing [cf. Exp. 4] or \nthe grasping of objects of different shapes but identical width [cf. Exp. 5]) did not \nalso yield improvements in perceptual performance. Nevertheless specific \nattention-enhancing effects of motor activity could explain D.F.\u201fs improved \nperformance in the grasping task. However, as has been said many times before, \nattention and representation are not independent from each other. Attention must \nact on a given representation, and thus the question arises as to which \nrepresentation is enhanced by the concurrent motor activity. If we assume that it \nis the visuomotor processing in the dorsal pathway which is enhanced, we end \nup with an explanation which is very similar to our own, namely that D.F.\u201fs \nimproved performance is based on access to dorsal-stream processing. The \nalternative, namely that motor-induced attention could have enhanced the \nrepresentation in the ventral pathway is highly unlikely given that recent MRI and \nfMRI evidence has shown that the relevant form areas of the ventral pathway are \ndestroyed in patient D.F. (James et al., 2003). \n \nThe findings of this study not only show that the perceptual system can \nsuccessfully access information from the dorsal stream, they also suggest that \nthe intact grasping behaviour of D.F. cannot be taken as evidence for implicit \nprocessing shape per se in the dorsal stream. In the first studies on D.F.\u201fs \n 22 \ngrasping behaviour (Goodale et al., 1991; 1994b) her ability to adjust her grip to \nthe shape of the target object might seem to suggest that she still had implicit \naccess to shape information. In reality, however, Goodale et al. (1991) only \nreported that D.F. could use width information to guide her grasping movements. \nIn traditional grasping studies the effects of shape information and width \ninformation are hard to disentangle because changes in shape are only likely to \nhave an effect on grasp aperture when those changes are linked to changes in \nobject width (Jeannerod, 1996; Smeets and Brenner, 1999; Rosenbaum et al., \n2001). However, using the paradigm from Experiment 5, it was possible to \ndisentangle the effects of shape and width. Combining the shape discrimination \ntask with the grasping task allowed us to assess the visual information that was \npresent in the dorsal stream independently of its effect on the formation of the \ngrasp aperture. We could therefore examine whether target objects of identical \nwidth but different shape would also improve shape discrimination performance. \nWe expected that if shape information is used during a grasping movement and \nthus represented in the dorsal stream, then improved shape discrimination \nperformance should be observed even for objects of different shape but identical \nwidth. However, we found that D.F.\u201fs performance in this condition is not better \nthan chance, suggesting that she is only processing width information in this \ngrasping task, and not shape.  This means that D.F.\u201fs preserved grasping ability \ncannot be taken as evidence for the processing of shape information in the \ndorsal pathway. This conclusion is consistent with an earlier study showing that \nD.F.\u201fs ability to choose optimal grip points is impaired in a condition where \u201ctrue\u201d \n 23 \nshape processing is required because no single dimension is sufficient to inform \nthe best choice of grip points (Carey et al., 1996; Goodale et al., 1994a). \nHowever, it is worth noting that in non-human primates evidence for shape \nprocessing in the dorsal stream has been obtained (Sereno & Maunsell, 1998). \n \nAlthough it seems likely that DF\u201fs improved perceptual performance is based on \ninformation from the dorsal stream, it remains unclear as to exactly how this \nimprovement could come about. If we assume that only the ventral stream \nprovides visual information to our cognitive system then we also have to assume \nthat it is via the modulation of activity in preserved parts of D.F.\u201fs ventral stream \nthat the dorsal representation exerts its effect on the perceptual judgement. \nCandidates for such preserved parts of DF\u201fs ventral stream have been identified \nin a recent fMRI study (James et al., 2003). In that study it was shown that if \ngrey-scale or colour images of objects are used, both DF\u201fs primary visual cortex \nand areas of the lingual and fusiform gyri become active, whereas these areas \nremain inactive when line-drawings are used. These regions of the ventral \nstream might be able to support the width discrimination required in our \nperceptual tasks if additional information from the dorsal stream is provided. \nAlternatively, it is quite possible that the cognitive system can gain direct access \nto the visual representation in the dorsal stream. In fact functional imaging \nstudies have shown that some of the more posterior areas in the dorsal stream \n(notably area cIPS) are activated during object recognition tasks (Faillenot et al., \n1997, 1999; James et al., 2000, 2002). Unfortunately, on the basis of our findings \n 24 \nit is not possible to decide whether it is through dorsal\/ventral interaction or \nthrough direct access to this dorsal activity that the improvement of perceptual \nperformance with concurrent visuomotor activity is achieved.  \n \nOne notable aspect of our results is that D.F.\u201fs discriminative performance was \nable to improve by virtue of visuomotor processing prior to the execution of her \ngrasping response. This seems to suggest that the relevant representation of \nobject attributes in the dorsal stream becomes available during the programming \nof the visuomotor act. This would be at odds with a characterization of the dorsal \nstream as a fast visual processing stream involved only in the online guidance of \nmovements (Rossetti et al., 2003). However, there is evidence from patients \n(Perenin & Vighetto, 1988; Milner et al., 2003, Schindler et al., 2004) and healthy \nsubjects (Culham et al., 2003; Frey et al., 2005; Medendorp et al., 2005; Prado et \nal., 2005; Sigman et al., 2005) that the dorsal stream involvement in visuomotor \ncontrol is by no means restricted to tasks which require online visual guidance. \nIndeed it is also apparent in tasks where all the relevant visual information is \navailable prior to movement execution. In this case the dorsal stream is \npresumably involved in extracting the visuomotor parameters used for the motor \nprogram. A good example is provided by the visuomotor deficits of patients with \nlesions in the dorsal stream, namely patients with optic ataxia. These patients do \nhave problems with the on-line visual guidance of movements (Pisella et al., \n2000), but they also have problems at the movement programming stage in both \ntheir pointing behaviour (Milner et al., 2003) and in taking obstacles into account \n 25 \nwhen reaching (Schindler et al., 2004). Thus our assumption that the dorsal \nrepresentation is already available during the stage of planning a movement is \nquite consistent with our current knowledge of the role of the dorsal stream in the \ncontrol of movements.  \n \nOur finding that D.F.\u201fs discriminative performance was already improved prior to \nthe execution of the grasping response may also seem surprising in light of the \nresults of the earlier study of D.F. by Murphy et al. (1996). They compared D.F.\u201fs \nperformance not only in a conventional shape-discrimination task but also in a \nvisuomotor version where she had to indicate her choice by reaching for the \ncorrect target object. It was found that her shape-discrimination performance was \nsuperior in this visuomotor task. Murphy and colleagues argued, however, that \nD.F. had to rely on in-flight corrections to her reaching responses in order to \nachieve this superior discrimination performance. This reliance on in-flight \ncorrections might seem to be inconsistent with our claim that the relevant \ninformation for the width discrimination becomes available prior to the execution \nof the reaching movement. We do not believe, however, that Murphy et al.\u201fs \nfindings contradict our claim of the availability of width information during the \nplanning stage. Rather, we think that the specific nature of the task used by \nMurphy and colleagues might explain why their results differed from ours. \nMurphy et al. used a task where two objects were presented on any given trial, \nand thus D.F. first had to decide which of the two objects corresponded to the \ntarget shape (e.g. a square), and then move towards the selected target object. \n 26 \nThus, in this task D.F.\u201fs initial movement program would have been determined \nby her initial perceptual judgement, and therefore quite possibly dominated by \ndegraded information from the ventral stream (such information was sufficient to \nresult in a greater than chance discrimination in their task, as the authors used \nan easier pair of shapes than ours). Veridical dorsal-stream information about the \ntarget object may have become available later on and triggered the reported mid-\nflight corrections. This is in contrast to our study where no target selection was \nrequired. Thus in our study D.F. could prepare the reach-to-grasp movement at \nthe beginning of the trial, and the information processed during the motor \npreparation phase was then available to influence her verbal report. In our view \nthese differences between the tasks used in the two studies could explain why in \ncontrast to Murphy et al. we found evidence of visuomotor facilitation already at \nthe motor programming stage.  \n \nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that the perceptual system may be able to \ngain access to an object\u201fs visuomotor processing in the dorsal stream, when \nmore direct routes are unavailable due to brain damage. (It must be admitted, of \ncourse, that better \u201ediscrimination\u201f does not necessarily imply better \u201eperception\u201f, \nand instead D.F. could have been employing some indefinable \u201cimplicit\u201d cues of \nthe kind that enable blindsight patients to perform above chance in discrimination \ntasks.) Our results also suggest that the adjustment of D.F.\u201fs grip aperture to \ndifferent types of rectangular objects is based on width rather than on shape \ninformation. On this interpretation, the finding of intact grip adjustment in D.F. \n 27 \nwould only reflect implicit size processing, rather than shape processing per se, \nin the human dorsal stream. \n 28 \nReferences \nCarey, D.P., Harvey, M. & Milner, A.D.

At the beginning \nof the trial the subject\u201fs hand rested on the start switch. The release of the start \nswitch indicated the start of the subject\u201fs movement. In some trials (non-contact \ntrials) an escape movement of the target object was triggered as soon as the \nsubject\u201fs hand crossed the line between the two photosensors.  \n \nFigure 2. Shape discrimination performance (by verbal report) in Experiments 1-\n5. The bars depict the proportion of trials where D.F. recognized the shape of the \ntarget object correctly. The solid line indicates the values expected in the case of \nchance performance. D.F.\u201fs shape discrimination was only better than chance in \nExperiments 2 and 3. The results from Experiment 3 are restricted to trials where \nthe right hand was used. Control subjects performed without error in all five \nexperiments. \n \nFigure 3. Averaged time-course of D.F.\u201fs grip apertures in Experiment 3. \nTrajectories for each hand (left hand, both hands, right hand) are presented in \nseparate graphs. The mean trajectory for trials with the square and the rectangle \nare represented by separate curves. The grasp trajectories for the two different \nshapes only differ in the case of bimanual grasping.  \n \nFigure 4. Mean of D.F.\u201fs maximum grip aperture in Experiment 3. The different \nhands are presented in different groups. Empty bars represent the mean (and \n 34 \nstandard deviation) of trials with the square; filled bars represent trials with the \nrectangle. A significant difference between the grip aperture for the square and \nthe rectangle is only found in the case of bimanual grasping.  \n \nFigure 5. A comparison of D.F.\u201fs discriminative and motor responses in \nExperiment 3 using two different measures of accuracy. A. d\u201f measures the \naccuracy with which the two shapes are discriminated. Empty bars depict d\u201f \nbased on the motor response (i.e. maximum grip aperture); filled bars show d\u201f \nbased on the verbal response (i.e. proportion of correct responses). As \nmeasured by d\u201f, discrimination accuracy is consistently (and in the case of the \nunimanual conditions substantially) higher than the d\u201f for the motor response. B. \nEmpty bars depict the proportion of correct shape discrimination responses \nwhich would be expected if D.F. had based her verbal response on the maximum \ngrip aperture attained in any given trial. Filled bars depict the actual proportion of \ncorrect responses which were obtained in verbal report. In the case of the \nunimanual conditions, the actual proportion of correct responses is significantly \nhigher than the proportion that would be expected on the basis of the motor \nresponse.  \n \n 35 \nTable 1: Summary of procedures and properties of Experiments 1-5.  \n \nExp.
