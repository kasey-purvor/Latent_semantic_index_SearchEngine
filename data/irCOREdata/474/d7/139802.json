To 13 \nlimit the amounts of water used for several horticultural crops, water deficit irrigation (DI) has been 14 \nseen as a potential alternative for new cultivation systems. DI in strawberry fruits is generally 15 \nassociated with reduction in berry size and yield; however, a recent study demonstrated that DI on 16 \nstrawberry can increase the concentration of some taste- and health-related compounds in fruits from 17 \ncv. Elsanta. Hence, the aim of the present study was to further corroborate such findings and to assess 18 \nthe response (and variability) among different strawberry cultivars (namely Christine, Elsanta, 19 \nFlorence, Sonata and Symphony) to imposed water-DI conditions. Water-DI affected both fruit 20 \nphysiology and biochemistry. Nevertheless, the response to drought stress was different for each of the 21 \ncultivars tested. Plants from cvs. Elsanta, Sonata and Symphony showed a greater reduction in berry 22 \nsize, accompanied by a significant increase in dry matter content for fruit harvested from DI-treated 23 \nplants. Concomitant to this, and where dry matter was increased, the concentrations of sugars and some 24 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nacids were generally higher in DI-derived fruit. In contrast, cvs. Florence and Christine did not show 25 \nsignificant variations in berry weight or any of the target analytes measured when grown under the 26 \nconditions imposed in this study. The results presented herein suggest that reducing water irrigation 27 \nbetween flower initiation and fruit harvest may be a viable technique for increasing the concentrations 28 \nof taste-related compounds in cvs. Elsanta, Sonata and Symphony and it may not have a negative 29 \nimpact on overall fruit size of cvs. Christine and Florence.  30 \n 31 \nKeywords: Berry size, dry matter, organic acids, sugars, sweetness 32 \n 33 \n1. Introduction 34 \nDemand for and availability of strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) have increased 35 \nsubstantially during recent years, driven in part, by the highly desired taste of the fruit, along with its 36 \nknown health-promoting properties (Wang, Feng, Lu, Bowman & Ding, 2005). To satisfy this demand, 37 \nover 250,000 ha are currently designated for strawberry cultivation worldwide (FAOSTAT, 2007). 38 \nStrawberry production is generally irrigated, as it is known that strawberry plants are very sensitive to 39 \ndrought stress during flowering and fruit ripening (Kr\u00fcger, Schmidt & Br\u00fcckner, 1999). Nowadays, 40 \nhowever, concerns are arising due to the high water abstractions used for some horticultural purposes, 41 \nespecially in some areas where water resources are already scarce or threatened. Growers are under 42 \nincreasing pressure to demonstrate that their water abstractions for irrigation are reasonable, justified 43 \nand environmentally sustainable (Fereres & Soriano, 2007; Terry, Chope & Gin\u00e9 Bordonaba, 2007a; 44 \nLeathes, Knox, Kay, Trawick & Rodr\u00edguez-Diaz, 2008). To ease pressure on existing water resources, 45 \nwater deficit irrigation (DI) has been seen as a potential alternative for new cultivation systems which 46 \ncould not only considerably reduce water usage but also increase water use efficiency in several 47 \nhorticultural crops (Topcu, Kirda, Dasgan, Kaman, Cetin, Yazici & Bacon, 2007). DI, also known as 48 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nregulated deficit irrigation (RDI), is an irrigation technique whereby crops are exposed to lower 49 \namounts of water and the minor stress experienced by the plant is expected to have a minimal effect on 50 \nthe yield (English & Raja, 1996). In strawberry plants, however, this technique (DI) is generally 51 \nassociated with reduction in fruit size and yield (Blatt, 1984; Serrano, Carbonell, Sav\u00e9, Marf\u00e0 & 52 \nPe\u00f1uelas, 1992; Kr\u00fcger et al., 1999; Liu, Savi\u0001, Jensen, Shahnazari, Jacobsen, Stiki\u0001 & Andersen, 53 \n2007).  Nevertheless, a recent study demonstrated that DI of strawberry cv. Elsanta plants can markedly 54 \nincrease the concentration of some taste- and health-related compounds in both primary and secondary 55 \nripe fruit (Terry et al., 2007a).  Indeed, despite berry size being detrimentally affected by DI, 56 \nmonosaccharides, and more importantly the sugar\/acid ratio, were generally much greater in DI-treated 57 \nfruits. In this context, the ratio between sugar and acids in strawberries and other berries can act as an 58 \nimportant indicator of fruit taste (Terry, White & Tigwell, 2005; Gin\u00e9 Bordonaba & Terry, 2008), fruit 59 \nripeness (P\u00e9rez, Ol\u00edas, Espada, Ol\u00edas & Sanz, 1997) or even as an index of consumer acceptability 60 \n(Keutgen & Pawelzik, 2007a).  61 \nMost of the studies conducted thus far, which have endeavoured to elucidate the effect of DI on 62 \nstrawberry fruit, have been focused on a single cultivar, rather than evaluating the response of different 63 \ngenotypes to imposed water deficit conditions. It is known that different strawberry cultivars respond 64 \ndifferently to imposed stress conditions. For instance, cvs. Elsanta and Korona responded differently 65 \nwhen grown in enriched ozone atmospheres (Keutgen & Pawelzik, 2008a) or under long term salt 66 \nstress (Keutgen & Pawelzik, 2008b). It is therefore plausible to speculate that strawberry cultivars will 67 \nrespond differently to imposed DI conditions. Hence, the aim of the present study was to assess the 68 \nresponse (and variability) among five different strawberry cultivars (namely Christine, Elsanta, 69 \nFlorence, Sonata and Symphony) to imposed water-DI conditions. Specific emphasis was given to 70 \nquantifying sugars and organic acids as the main indicators of strawberry fruit quality and taste. 71 \n 72 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n2. Materials and methods 73 \n2.1. Plant materials and experimental design 74 \nFive different maiden year cold-stored strawberry cultivars were grown in a glasshouse during 75 \n2007 (April to July) in 1 l capacity pots containing compost. The total nitrogen concentration of the 76 \ncompost substrate was 8.88 g N kg-1, as determined by Kjeldahl analysis. A completely randomised 77 \ndesign was adopted with each of 4 blocks containing 30 plants (5 cvs. x 3 replicates x 2 treatments = 30 78 \nx 4 blocks = 120). Water treatments started when most of the primary fruits from the primary truss 79 \nwere at flower initiation stage.  Plants were irrigated with either 50 or 200 ml day-1 over an eight-week 80 \nperiods, daily (ca. 09:00 h). Prior to commencing water treatments, plants were kept at or near field 81 \ncapacity (ca. 0.8 m3 of water per m3 of soil) for approximately four weeks. Plants were treated to 82 \nprevent incidence of spider mites (Tetranychus spp.) and powdery mildew (Podosphaera aphanis, 83 \nformerly Sphaerotheca macularis (Wallr.: Fr) Jacz f sp. fragariae Peries), as described elsewhere 84 \n(Terry & Joyce, 2000; Terry et al., 2007a). Flowers were hand-pollinated with a sable paintbrush to 85 \nminimise the occurrence of misshapen fruit.   86 \n 87 \n2.2. Soil moisture content and environmental monitoring 88 \nSoil moisture content (m3 water per m3 of growing media) was measured daily (ca. 16.00h) by 89 \ntime-domain-reflectometry (TDR), using a Thetaprobe (ThetaKit type TK3, Delta-T devices, Cambs., 90 \nUK). The water-holding characteristics of the soil media were determined as described by Terry et al. 91 \n(2007a). Hourly temperatures within the glasshouse were recorded by means of four Tiny Tag Ultra 2 92 \ndata loggers (Gemini Data Logger, Sussex, UK), each shielded from solar radiation by a polystyrene 93 \ncup and placed in each block. Mean temperature inside the glasshouse during the growing period was 94 \n21 \u00baC. 95 \n 96 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n2.3. Fruit sampling  97 \nFrom each plant, both of the secondary fruits from the primary truss were harvested according 98 \nto developmental stage.  All fruits were harvested at the red stage, which was considered as optimum 99 \nripeness.  Days after anthesis (DAA) was monitored for primary and secondary fruits from the primary 100 \ntruss by tagging of flowers (n = 360) at anthesis (Terry & Joyce, 2000).  The objective colour of each 101 \nfruit was measured using a Minolta CR-400 colorimeter and a DP-400 data processor (Minolta Co. 102 \nLtd., Japan) with an 8 mm light-path aperture.  The instrument was calibrated with a Minolta standard 103 \nwhite tile CR-400 (Y = 93.5, x = 0.3114, y = 0.3190).  The mean of three readings at 3 equidistant 104 \npoints around the equatorial axis of the fruits were recorded and the lightness (L*), chroma (colour 105 \nsaturation; C*) and hue angle (H\u00b0) automatically calculated (Terry, Ilkenhans, Poulston, Rowsell & 106 \nSmith, 2007b).  Berry weight, with and without calyx, was measured and recorded. Strawberry 107 \nsecondary fruits without calyces were cut in half vertically, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen 108 \nand stored briefly at -40\u00b0C before being freeze-dried in an Edwards Modulyo freeze-drier (W. Sussex, 109 \nUK) for 3 days at 0.015kPa. Lyophilized samples were then ground in a pestle and mortar, weighed and 110 \nreturned to the freezer prior to use.  All reagents were purchased from Sigma (Dorset, UK) unless 111 \notherwise stated.   112 \n 113 \n2.4.Extraction and quantification of sugars   114 \nSugars were extracted using 62.5% (v\/v) aqueous methanol, as described elsewhere (Terry et 115 \nal., 2007a). Sugar content in strawberry extracts was determined using an Agilent 1200 series HPLC 116 \nbinary pump system (Agilent, Berks., UK), equipped with an Agilent refractive index detector (RID) 117 \nG1362A.  Strawberry extracts (20 \u0002l) were diluted (1:10), and injected into a Rezex RCM 118 \nmonosaccharide Ca+ (8%) column of 300 mm x 7.8 mm diameter (Phenomenex, CA, USA; Part no. 119 \n00H-0130-K0) with a Carbo-Ca2+ guard column of 4 mm x 3 mm diameter (Phenomenex,;  Part no. 120 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nAJ0-4493). Temperature of the column was set at 80\u00baC, using a G1316A thermostatted column 121 \ncompartment. The mobile phase used was HPLC grade water at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min-1 (Terry et al., 122 \n2007a; Gin\u00e9 Bordonaba & Terry, 2008). Temperature of the optical unit in the detector was set up at 123 \n30\u00baC and temperature of the autosampler at 4\u00baC using an Agilent cooled autosampler G1330B. The 124 \npresence and abundance of fructose, glucose and sucrose were automatically calculated by comparing 125 \nsample peak area to standards (0.025-2.5 mg ml-1) using ChemStation Rev. B.02.01.   126 \n  127 \n2.5.Extraction and quantification of non-volatile organic acids   128 \nExtracts for organic acids determination were prepared as described elsewhere (Terry et al., 129 \n2007a; Gin\u00e9 Bordonaba & Terry, 2008). Briefly, freeze-dried strawberry extracts (50 mg) were 130 \ndissolved in 3 ml of HPLC grade water.  Samples were kept at room temperature (25\u00baC) for 10 min and 131 \nthen filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m syringe filter. L-ascorbic, citric, and malic acid contents in extracts were 132 \ndetected at 210 nm, using the same HPLC system, as described above, equipped with an Agilent DAD 133 \nG1315B\/G1365B photodiode array with multiple wavelength detector. Extracts (20 \u0002l) were injected 134 \ninto an Alltech Prevail Organic Acid column 250 mm x 4.6 mm diameter, 5 \u0002m particle size (Alltech, 135 \nCA, USA; Part no. 88645) with an Alltech Prevail Organic Acid guard column of 7.5 mm x 4.6 mm 136 \ndiameter (Alltech; Part no. 96429).  The mobile phase was analytical grade degassed 0.2% (w\/v) 137 \nmetaphosphoric acid in H2O (Gin\u00e9 Bordonaba and Terry, 2008). The flow rate of the mobile phase was 138 \n1.0 ml min-1 under isocratic conditions and the column temperature was set at 35 \u00baC.  Temperature of 139 \nthe autosampler was set at 4\u00baC.  The presence and quantity of each acid was calculated by comparing 140 \nthe peak area obtained with standards (0.02-2.0 mg ml-1), using ChemStation Rev. B.02.01.  141 \n 142 \n 143 \n 144 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n2.6. Estimation of strawberry taste parameters  145 \n Sweetness index (SI) for the different cultivars analysed was calculated as previously described 146 \n(Keutgen & Pawelzik, 2007a). Briefly, the contribution of each major sugar found in strawberry fruits 147 \nwas calculated, considering that fructose and sucrose are 2.3 and 1.35 times sweeter than glucose, 148 \nrespectively. Accordingly, SI = 1.0 [Glucose] + 1.35 [Sucrose] + 2.3 [fructose].   149 \n 150 \n2.7. Data analysis 151 \nAll statistical analyses were carried out using Genstat for Windows, Version 10 (VSN 152 \nInternational Ltd., Herts., UK). Data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests, based on a 153 \ncompletely randomised design within blocks. Least significant difference values (LSD; P = 0.05) were 154 \ncalculated for mean separations, using critical values of t for two-tailed tests. Correlations between 155 \nexperimental variables were made using Spearman\u2019s rank correlations and, if required, presented as 156 \nSpearman\u2019s correlation coefficient (r) and P value, based on a two-tailed test. Unless otherwise stated, 157 \nsignificant differences were P < 0.05.  158 \n 159 \n3. Results and discussion 160 \n3.1. Soil water status 161 \nSoil water content values of the growing media differed between treatments, but also between 162 \ncultivars when submitted to DI conditions, indicating the existence of genotypic differences in the 163 \nresponse of strawberry plants to drought stress, as well as differences in water usage between different 164 \ncultivars. Values for non-DI-treated plants were consistent between cultivars, ranging from 0.73 to 0.85 165 \nm3 of water per m3 of growing media (Figure 1). Similar water contents were observed by Terry et al. 166 \n(2007a) when assessing water deficit irrigation in cv. Elsanta fruits grown under comparable 167 \nconditions. Greater differences between water content of soils from water-stressed plants and plants 168 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nkept at or near field capacity were observed for cv. Elsanta during the whole duration of the study 169 \n(Figure 1). Elsanta plants grown under drought stress conditions used more water (up to 20% more) 170 \nfrom the growing medium during the first days after commencing water treatments than did the rest of 171 \ncultivars. Water usage of DI-treated plants for cvs. Sonata and Symphony were similar throughout the 172 \ntrial as was also observed for cvs. Florence and Christine. Higher water uptake for Elsanta plants may 173 \nbe the result of either the increase in root growth or root hydraulic conductivity or even greater water 174 \nusage as compared to other cvs. (Savi\u0001, Stiki\u0001, Radovi\u0001, Bogi\u0003evi\u0001, Jovanovi\u0001 & \u0160ukalovi\u0001, 2008). 175 \nOverall, water content in the growing media of DI-treated plants declined, following water-soil 176 \ndynamics similar to those previously described (Liu et al., 2007; Terry et al., 2007a; Savic et al., 2008).  177 \n 178 \n3.2. Effect of DI on fruit physiology 179 \nThe response of fruit physiology to water stress was dependent on the genotype. Differences in 180 \nfruit physiology among cultivars may be accounted for by differences in abscisic acid (ABA) or other 181 \nhormone metabolism in plants exposed to drought stress. For instance, the plant hormone ABA 182 \nregulates various physiological reactions in plants and its role in the response to drought stress is well 183 \ndocumented for many horticultural crops (Seki, Umezawa, Urano & Shinozaki, 2007). In strawberry 184 \nplants (cv. Elsanta), grown under comparable DI conditions, ABA was greater than that of fully 185 \nirrigated plants (Terry et al., 2007a). In the present study, berry weight from secondary strawberry 186 \nfruits was significantly reduced (approximately 1\/3 lower) by DI in cvs. Symphony, Elsanta and Sonata 187 \n(Figure 2a). However, both cvs. Christine and Florence showed similar weights, for both water-stressed 188 \nand non water-stressed plants. Concomitant with this, and in those cultivars where berry size was 189 \nreduced, dry matter, as a proportion of fresh weight, was considerably greater in fruits from water-190 \nstressed plants than from plants kept at or near field capacity (Figure 2b). Previous studies also showed 191 \nthat fruit from strawberry plants that received full irrigation had a higher water content and greater 192 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nberry fresh weight than had fruit from plants grown under reduced irrigation (Blatt, 1984; Serrano et 193 \nal., 1992; Kr\u00fcger et al., 1999; Kirnak, Kaya, Higgs & Gercek, 2001; Kirnak, Kaya, Higgs, Bolat, 194 \nSimsek & Ikinci, 2003; Liu et al., 2007; Terry et al., 2007a). Fruits from cv. Elsanta showed the 195 \ngreatest increase (1.24-fold higher) in dry matter content as a proportion of fresh weight in response to 196 \nreduced water supply. These findings were in agreement with Terry et al. (2007a), since strawberry 197 \nfruits (cv. Elsanta) from DI-treated plants also showed 25% more dry matter than did non-water 198 \nstressed plants. Similarly, Kirnak et al. (2003) reported higher soluble dry matter contents for cvs. Oso 199 \nGrande and Camarosa fruits submitted to DI in trials conducted in the field. Plant responses to either 200 \nwater or salt stress have been reported to have much in common (Munns, 2002). For instance, salinity 201 \nreduces the capacity of plants to take up water, which may result in reduced growth rate and metabolic 202 \nchanges similar to those observed in plants grown under water stress. In this context, strawberry plants 203 \ngrown under high salinity conditions had either higher (Awang & Atherton, 1995) or lower (Keutgen & 204 \nPawelzik, 2008b) dry matter contents. The greater dry matter content observed in the results presented 205 \nherein suggests a concentration effect by either limitation of water uptake and\/or enhanced import of 206 \nsolutes into the fruit. In this study, dry matter content from other parts of the plants were not 207 \ninvestigated and therefore, it is difficult to conclude whether or not the increased dry matter may be  208 \nthe result of a trade off in resource allocation within the plant (e.g. vegetative and root growth versus 209 \nfruit growth). This said, the dilution effect observed in plants that received more water was limited to 210 \ncertain cultivars since fruits from cv. Christine and\/or Florence showed similar dry matter contents 211 \nbetween DI-treated and non-water-stressed plants (Figure 2b).  212 \nAnthesis occurred significantly (P < 0.05) later in water-stressed plants for cvs. Elsanta, 213 \nFlorence and Christine and was generally reduced for the other cultivars investigated.  In a similar 214 \nmanner, fruit maturation was also slower for some water-stressed cvs. (viz. Elsanta and Christine) 215 \ntaking 33 days after anthesis for plants treated with 50 ml of water per day in comparison to 31 days for 216 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nplants receiving 200 ml per day (data not shown). Time from anthesis to harvest for all other cvs. was 217 \nnot affected by DI. Terry et al. (2007a) also found that fruit maturation was slower (not significantly) in 218 \nElsanta fruit grown under drought stress conditions. Indeed, it has been shown that, for certain crops, 219 \ndrought stress may result in considerable increase of the time to anthesis and to physiological maturity 220 \n(Geerts, Raes, Garcia, Mendoza & Huanca, 2008).  221 \n 222 \n3.3. Effect of DI on taste-related compounds and overall fruit quality 223 \nColour of strawberries is without doubt one of the main attributes which governs consumer 224 \nperception and therefore their acceptability (Francis, 1995). Objective colour of each fruit was 225 \nmeasured when fruit was adjudged to be at optimum ripeness (when fully red) and significant 226 \ndifferences were encountered between the different cultivars investigated (Table 1). Similarly, 227 \nsignificant differences in objective colour have been reported by others when studying different 228 \ncultivars (Sacks & Shaw, 1994; Capocasa, Scalzo, Mezzetti & Battino, 2008; Hernanz, Recamales, 229 \nMel\u00e9ndez-Mart\u00ednez, Gonz\u00e1lez-Miret & Heredia, 2008; Gin\u00e9 Bordonaba and Terry, 2009) or between 230 \nfruits from plants grown under different conditions (Hernanz et al., 2008). Generally, no significant 231 \ndifferences were observed for colour (L*, C*, H\u00b0) parameters among secondary fruits within a cultivar. 232 \nNonetheless, even if all fruit were picked at the full red stage, significant differences were encountered 233 \nfor C* values among fruits from Elsanta. Accordingly, previous work carried out by Terry et al. 234 \n(2007a) also found significant differences in the objective colour of  strawberry cv. Elsanta fruits when  235 \npicked at optimum harvest. Generally, DI had a considerable effect on objective fruit colour. Plants 236 \nreceiving 50 ml of water per day showed lower C* values than did non-water-stressed plants (Table 1). 237 \nThese differences were especially highlighted for cvs. Elsanta, Sonata and Florence (P < 0.05). The 238 \neffect of DI on L* and H\u00ba values was dependent on the cultivar. Some cultivars (namely Elsanta and 239 \nSymphony) showed higher values for lightness (L*) and lower redness (higher H\u00ba) for  240 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nplants receiving 50 ml per day than did non-water-stressed plants. The remaining cultivars tended to 241 \nshow lower L* and H\u00b0 values for DI-treated plants (Table 1). Likewise, Terry et al. (2007a) also found 242 \nhigher Hue angles in cv. Elsanta fruits treated with 50 ml day-1 than with plants receiving either 100 or 243 \n200 ml day-1. Strawberry fruit colour is due, in part, to anthocyanins, which account for the red colour 244 \nof the fruits. It will be expected, therefore, that if lower red coloration (higher H\u00ba) is reported for water-245 \nstressed plants, lower anthocyanin contents will also be encountered in the fruit. However, in the study 246 \ncarried out by Terry et al. (2007a), DI resulted in lower redness but higher concentration of 247 \npelargonidin-3-glucoside and derivatives of this anthocyanin on a FW basis. In view of that, the authors 248 \nsuggested that the lower redness in smaller fruits was most probably an artefact of the objective 249 \ncolorimeter measurement since shorter distances between achenes will exist in smaller fruits, resulting 250 \nin lower recorded redness.   251 \n Little information is available which describes the effect of DI on the taste-related attributes 252 \n(namely sugars and acids) of strawberries (Terry et al., 2007a).  In contrast, ample data are available on 253 \nthe effect of either cultivation practices or other stress conditions (namely ozone exposure, salinity) on 254 \nstrawberry fruit quality (Wang, Zheng & Galletta, 2002; Davik, Bakken, Holte & Blomhoff, 2006; 255 \nKeutgen & Pawelzik, 2007a and 2007b; Hargreaves, Adl, Warman & Rupasinghe, 2008; Keutgen & 256 \nPawelzik, 2008b; Hargreaves, Adl & Warman, 2009). In strawberry fruits, non-structural carbohydrates 257 \nare the main components of dry matter. Independent of the water treatment applied, results showed that 258 \nsugars accounted for 6 to 8% of the total fresh matter. Similar proportions have been reported by others 259 \n(Cordenunsi, do Nascimento, Genovese & Lajolo, 2002; M\u00e9nager, Jost & Aubert, 2004; Terry et al., 260 \n2007a; Keutgen & Pawelzik, 2008b). Fructose, glucose and sucrose were the three main sugars found 261 \nin the different strawberry genotypes studied, and concentrations differed significantly among cultivars 262 \nand water treatments (Table 2). Variations in sugar content between different cultivars are not unusual 263 \nand have been extensively reported (Wang et al., 2002; Skupien & Oszmia\u0004ski,  2004; Davik et al., 264 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n2006; Keutgen & Pawelzik, 2008a). The relative concentrations of sugars were similar between cvs. 265 \n(Table 2); however, fruit from cv. Sonata, had a greater sucrose content than had other cultivars 266 \nstudied. Overall, values were in the range of previously reported studies (Wang et al., 2002; Skupien & 267 \nOszmia\u0004ski, 2004; Davik et al., 2006; Keutgen & Pawelzik, 2008; Gin\u00e9 Bordonaba and Terry, 2009). 268 \nThis said, greater amounts of sucrose were encountered herein and can only really be comparable to the 269 \nresults from Terry et al. (2007a), given that the same extraction method was used. Along these lines, 270 \nfructose and glucose or sucrose are nearly twice or three times more soluble in methanol-based solvents 271 \nthan in aqueous-based solvents (Davis, Terry, Chope & Faul, 2007) and therefore the methanol-based 272 \nextraction used herein may have enhanced the solubility of these sugars, especially sucrose. 273 \nConsequently, it is clear that comparison of sugar contents in strawberry fruits from different studies 274 \nshould be treated with some caution.  275 \nBoth on a DW and FW basis, Florence and Sonata were the cvs. showing higher sugar content for non-276 \nwater-stressed plants (70.8 and 68.8 mg g-1 FW, respectively). Nevertheless, cvs. Elsanta and Sonata 277 \nfruits had the greater sugar content (82.34 and 81.57 mg g-1 FW, respectively) when subjected to DI. 278 \nFructose contents in cvs. Elsanta and Sonata plants, as well as glucose content in Elsanta, were the only 279 \nsugar contents significantly greater in DI-treated plants than in plants kept at or near field capacity 280 \n(Table 2). Previous studies (Terry et al., 2007a) also highlighted that, although sucrose was not affected 281 \nby DI, monossacharide contents (glucose and fructose) were significantly higher in DI plants. The 282 \nauthors concluded that lower concentrations of sugars in fruits that received more water were most 283 \nprobably due to a dilution effect. Despite total soluble solids not always being well correlated with 284 \nsugar content in strawberry fruits (Perez et al., 1997; Terry et al., 2005), in the study by Awang et al. 285 \n(1995), higher soluble solids content  in cv. Rapella, grown under salinity stress, was associated with 286 \nrestricted vegetative growth and shift of photoassimilates to fruits. In both of these cases, the results 287 \nfrom this study may support such findings. Although no evidence exists for strawberry fruits, it is well 288 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \ndocumented that plants grown under water stress undergo a process of osmotic adjustment (Mahajan & 289 \nTuteja, 2005). Thereby, the greater sugar content in DI-treated plants may be an attempt by the plant to 290 \nreduce osmotic potential by the accumulation of solutes.  291 \n 292 \nSweetness of strawberry fruits is an important factor which can characterise the acceptance of 293 \nthe fruits by consumers.  Considering that fructose is ca. 1.8 times sweeter than sucrose, and the 294 \nsweetness of glucose is 60% that of sucrose, DI resulted in generally sweeter berries, as determined by 295 \nthe sweetness index (Figure 3a). Fruits from Elsanta plants subjected to drought stress showed as much 296 \nas one third higher sweetness than fruits from plants kept at or near field capacity. A significant 297 \nincrease in the sweetness index of Sonata was also observed for DI-treated plants.  298 \n 299 \nTaste in strawberry fruits is not, however, only just influenced by sugars. Acids and volatile 300 \ncompounds are also important contributors to strawberry taste and flavour (Cordenunsi et al., 2002). In 301 \nthe present study, and in earlier reports (Perez et al., 1992; Keutgen & Pawelzik, 2007; Terry et al., 302 \n2007a), three major acids were found within the cultivars, corresponding to citric, malic and ascorbic 303 \nacids. Citric acid was the major acid found in the different cultivars investigated herein, accounting for 304 \napproximately 1% of the total fresh matter, in agreement with that found in the literature (Terry et al., 305 \n2007a; Keutgen & Pawelzik, 2008b; Gin\u00e9 Bordonaba & Terry, 2009). Malic and ascorbic acid were 306 \nalso identified in all cultivars at lower concentrations, up to 4.49 and 0.78 mg g-1 FW, respectively. 307 \nDrought stress also affected acid composition (Table 3). On a DW basis, plants kept at or near field 308 \ncapacity tended to have greater acid contents than did those exposed to drought stress.  Christine and 309 \nFlorence were the only cvs. where DI resulted in higher acid contents. However, considering the results 310 \non a FW basis, DI resulted in greater acid content for Symphony and Florence whilst it did not 311 \nsignificantly affect acid content for the rest of the cvs. In an ealier study, DI resulted in lower ascorbic, 312 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \ncitric and malic acid contents on a DW basis for Elsanta plants (Terry et al., 2007a); however, it is clear 313 \nthat, in the present study, DI had a genotype-dependent effect on acid metabolism. As indicated by 314 \ndifferences in fruit physiology, it may be plausible to speculate that DI resulted in different respiratory 315 \nmetabolisms among cultivars and hence different utilisations of respiratory substrates such as organic 316 \nacids. Strawberry fruits are an important source of ascorbic acid (AsA). This vitamin, in combination 317 \nwith other phytochemicals (namely anthocyanins and phenolic acids) found in strawberry has been 318 \nreported to be responsible for the numerous health benefits associated with these berries. In this 319 \ncontext, strawberries were recently ranked as one of the most important sources of cellular antioxidant 320 \nactivity in the North American diet (Wolfe, Kang, He, Dong, Zhang & Liu, 2008). In the present study, 321 \nthe concentration of AsA ranged from 0.42 (DI treated cv. Elsanta) to 0.73 (DI treated cv. Florence) mg 322 \ng-1 FW and was dependent on the water regime and cultivar. Values were in agreement with those 323 \npreviously reported (Perez et al., 1992; Davik et al., 2006; Terry et al., 2007a). DI resulted in 324 \nsignificantly lower and higher concentration of AsA only for cultivars Elsanta and Florence (Table 3). 325 \nDI had the greatest effect in cultivar Florence which showed a 1.3-fold higher AsA concentration in 326 \nfruits from water stressed plants, and hence perhaps resulting in more healthful berries. This said, 327 \nKeutgen and Pawelzik (2007b), testing strawberry fruits from plants grown under other environmental 328 \nstress conditions, observed that the content of ascorbic acid was reduced in fruits from cvs. Elsanta and 329 \nKorona plants subjected to moderate salt stress.  330 \n 331 \nThe balances between sugars and acids in strawberries and other berries are important 332 \nindicators of fruit taste (Terry et al., 2005 & 2007a; Gin\u00e9 Bordonaba & Terry, 2008). Additionally, the 333 \nratio can be used as an indicator of fruit ripeness (P\u00e9rez et al., 1997) or even as an index of consumer 334 \nacceptability (Keutgen & Pawelzik, 2007a). Recently, Terry et al. (2007a) showed that sugar\/ acid 335 \nratios were significantly greater in DI-treated plants than in non-water-stressed plants. The results from 336 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nthis study show that, although sugar\/acid ratios for DI-treated were substantially higher in Symphony, 337 \nElsanta and Sonata, significant differences between treatments (P < 0.05) were only encountered in 338 \nfruits from Sonata (Figure 3b). Water DI did not have a significant effect on the sugar \/ acid ratio of 339 \neither Christine or Florence, and comparable values were observed for both irrigation regimes. 340 \nCordenunsi et al. (2002) reported that good quality strawberry fruits were those with a ratio higher than 341 \n5.3. However, such information must be accepted with caution as values will directly depend on the 342 \nnature of the measurements. Plants kept at or near field capacity (for all the cultivars except 343 \nSymphony) had sugar acid ratios higher than 5 (e.g. Elsanta and Christine with values of 5.9). As a 344 \nresult of DI, the quality of strawberries was significantly and substantially higher in Sonata and Elsanta 345 \nwith values of 6.2 and 6.9, respectively.  346 \n 347 \n4. Conclusions 348 \nIt is known that DI on strawberry plants can reduce berry size and yield. However, the results 349 \npresented herein, and previous findings by Terry et al. (2007a), showed that DI can have a considerable 350 \neffect on the concentrations of certain compounds linked to taste and consumer preference. This study 351 \nshowed, for the first time, that differences exist in the way different cultivars respond to drought stress 352 \nresulting in different fruit compositions. Despite the detrimental effect that DI can have on berry size, 353 \nreducing water irrigation by a quarter from flower initiation to fruit harvest, resulted in better water use 354 \nefficiency, as well as enhanced fruit quality and taste (greater sweetness and sugar\/acid ratio) in cvs. 355 \nElsanta, Sonata and Symphony. In addition, results indicated that, for certain cultivars (namely 356 \nChristine and Florence), water savings by means of DI, can be achieved without having a negative 357 \neffect on overall strawberry fruit quality.   358 \n 359 \n 360 \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nAcknowledgements  361 \nThe authors thank the Horticultural Development Company (HDC; CP_43), The Perry 362 \nFoundation and GlaxoSmithKline for financial support.
