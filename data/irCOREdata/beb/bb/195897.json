This is a\ngeneric methodology that could be used to provide evidence in support of public health planning and decision\nmaking.\nBackground\nAmbulance response times are a crucial factor in patient\nsurvival, especially for severe emergency cases, where the\ntime to pre-hospital treatment is critical [1-3]. Studies\nhave reported the association between improved survival\nof high risk patients with decreased response times (i.e.\nthe time from emergency call receipt to ambulance arri-\nval on the scene). The crucial response time is less than 4\nto 5 minutes [4,5]. Additionally, ambulance response\ntime is recognised as an important benchmark measure\nor indicator of pre-hospital emergency medical services\n(EMS) quality [6]. Other work has considered different\naspects of ambulance management to improve response\ntimes, to enhance EMS management and to relocate\nambulance stations [7-9]. Although statistical models for\nidentifying the optimal location of ambulances have been\ndiscussed [10], practical methods for ambulance reloca-\ntion and the evaluation of the benefits of relocation have\nbeen limited.\nThe need to maximise the effectiveness of public\nhealth resources is accentuated by projected population\nchanges: the developed world is increasingly aging as\nlongevity increases. In Japan, recent changes in the\npopulation have increased the demand for EMS and one\nconsequence is increased ambulance response times due\nto reduced ambulance availability. In Niigata prefecture\nthe volume of emergency calls has risen by 50% in 10\nyears from 55,434 cases in 1997 to 84,730 cases in 2007\nand average ambulance response times have increased\n* Correspondence: ajc36@le.ac.uk\n\u2020 Contributed equally\n2Department of Geography, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK\nSasaki et al.

The number of people over 65\nyears old in Japan has been increasing. There are two\nsalient factors associating the elderly population to\nincreased ambulance response times and to increased\nnumbers of EMS case numbers. First, the aged are dis-\nproportionately high users of ambulance services [12]\nand they are more likely to require ambulances for life-\nthreatening emergencies [13] such as cardiovascular and\ncerebrovascular disease. Second the elderly the propor-\ntion of the population that is elderly has increased and\nwill continue to increase in the future. Currently in\nJapan they constitute 20% of the total population and\naccording to future population predictions this figure\nwill rise to up to 40% in 2050 [14]. The net effect will\nbe to further increases EMS demands and thus response\ntimes due to ambulance unavailability.\nThe use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the\npublic health arena reflects a wider understanding of the\nimportance of spatial analyses. GIS and related spatial\ntechniques have been used as tools to analyse the spatial\npatterns of disease, to examine the relationship between\nhealth outcomes and accessibility, and for for better health\ncare delivery [15-18]. There is also a role for analyses that\ncan support public health planning, for example to maxi-\nmise resource use efficiency, in the context of current and\nfuture public health needs. Genetic Algorithms (GAs)\nhave been used extensively to develop optimal or heuristic\nsearch solutions to spatial problems in combination with\nGIS-based analyses. GAs are search and optimisation algo-\nrithms [19] that simulate the process of genetic mutation\nand selection in biological evolution. They are used when\nthe number of possible solutions to a problem is too large\nto be evaluated within normal computing constraints - i.e.\nusing deterministic methods. In the health geographics\narena GAs have been compared with simulated annealing\nand neighbourhood search methods to determine optimal\nlocations for hospital in Hong Kong [20]. They have been\nused to generate criteria weights as inputs to routing pro-\nblems [21] and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production\n(GARP) software has been used to determine ecological\nniche models of monkeypox in Africa [22].\nRecent work on ambulance location has included both\ndeterministic and probabilistic models, reviewed in\nSchilling et al [23] and Brotocorne et al [10] respec-\ntively. Deterministic models have been used to simulate\nambulance catchment areas and reduce response times\nbased on ambulance call and dispatch logs [9], set cov-\nering models have been developed to identify ambulance\nfacility locations accounting for the probability of vehi-\ncles being busy [24] and p-median models applied to\nambulance locations in British Columbia [25]. Probabil-\nistic models, simulating ambulance location have been\ndeveloped for simple problems, for example locating 5\nor 6 ambulances along a single stretch of highway\n[26,27] and to accommodate diurnal changes in popula-\ntion over a set of regular but hypothetical demand\npoints [28]. The results are efficient computational mod-\nels applied to simple real world problems, but which do\nnot use actual EMS case data and are not evaluated in\nterms of improved response to EMS demands.\nIn this work a GA was used to model optimal ambu-\nlance locations from projected and current EMS case\ndata. Current and predicted EMS cases were sum-\nmarised over census areas and a GIS network analysis\nwas used to measure distances between potential ambu-\nlance locations and census areas. The GA was used to\nmodel sets of potential locations for n= 2 to n= 50\nambulances from 35 current locations allowing for up to\n5 ambulances at each (i.e. 175 potential locations) and\nevaluating them by minimising person (EMS case) dis-\ntances. The GA approach is described in more detail\nbelow. The number of potential sets of locations to eval-\nuate is large (e.g. 1.224 e+346 for 27 locations) and may\nbe deterministically solvable. However the method needs\nto be able to accommodate future resource planning and\nneeds to be able model new potential locations (i.e. not\nat current fire stations) along with current potential\nlocations. Other work by the authors has identified 1255\nalternative locations for fire stations and ambulances\nwhich planners may want to include in future analyses.\nNetwork distances provide a more realistic measure of\naccess distances and travel times than either the urban\/\nrural characterisations for health accessibility as proxies\nused by Hossain and Liditka, [29] or buffer area based\napproaches with concentric zones around facilities as used\nby Mclafferty and Grady [30]. In health planning GIS-based\nnetwork analyses have been extensively used to analyse ser-\nvice accessibility [31-33] as well as to define service catch-\nments [32,34]. Other work has combined GIS analyses with\ngenetic algorithms to model optimal locations in order to\nmaximise accessibility for specific social groups [35].\nThe purpose of this work was to identify optimal ambu-\nlance locations based on predicted future EMS cases and\nto develop future EMS management strategies based on\npredicted demands. The modelling steps were as follows:\n1. Summarise EMS case data over census areas;\n2. Correlate demographic data to EMS cases;\n3. Use demographic predictions to infer future EMS\ncases over census areas;\n4. Calculate network distances between \u2018supply\u2019\n(potential ambulance locations) and \u2018demand\u2019 (cur-\nrent and future EMS cases);\n5. Model, compare and evaluate optimal current and\nfuture ambulance locations.\nThe research demonstrates a practical method for\noptimising the location of public health facilities by\nSasaki et al.

In Japan there is a one-tiered EMS\nsystem provided by the fire department [36]. Ambu-\nlances are typically located in the building of a fire sta-\ntion. In Niigata there are 35 fire stations which are\npotential locations for ambulances. Currently 27 ambu-\nlances are operated from 27 fire stations. The deploy-\nment of an ambulance to the scene is controlled by a\ncentral command system. When an emergency call is\nreceived, the nearest available ambulance to the scene is\ndeployed to the incident.\nData\nThe Niigata City Fire Bureau provided pre-hospital\nmedical emergency records of the 21,788 cases that\nwere attended by an ambulance in the period April to\nDecember in 2007. Of these 21,211 were geocoded and\nused for this study (the remainder had no locational\ninformation associated with them). From the emergency\ncase data, the distribution of monthly ambulance users\nper 1,000 population were calculated for different age\nand gender categories. The Japanese 2005 census has\n2076 census small areas in Niigata. The count of emer-\ngency cases in each census area was calculated using a\npoint-in-polygon operation and attached as an attribute\nto the census data with ArcGIS v 9.2 (ESRI, USA). The\ncentre point (centroid) was calculated for each census\nsmall area using its area (x, y) envelope. The road net-\nwork for Niigata was provided by Increment P Corpora-\ntions, Japan.\nStatistical pre-processing: calculation of future EMS cases\nA prediction model to estimate future EMS demands\nwas developed from a multivariable regression analysis.\nThe following variables were extracted from the 2005\npopulation census for the 2076 small areas: the counts\nof 0-4 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and incre-\nmental age groups of every 5 years after 65 years. Addi-\ntionally, counts of the number of companies employing\nmore than five people from the enterprise census of\n2008 were included in the regression. The census vari-\nables describe groups who may be more likely to need\nan ambulance. The employee variable describes the\ndiurnal population flux to the city related to employ-\nment and increased numbers of people in business and\nindustrial areas. The parameter estimates were obtained\nby a stepwise ordinary least squares regression analysis\nwith SPSS ver.11 (SPSS, USA). Future EMS demands for\ncensus small areas for 5-year periods from 2015 to 2040\nwere estimated using projected population growth and\nconsistent socio-economic variables using the predictive\nmodel.\nThe future populations of the different age groups\nindicated above for 2015 to 2040 were used as input of\nthe predictive model. These were calculated from popu-\nlations of 5 year age categories for males and females\nfrom the 2000 and 2005 census. The study area was\ndivided into 38 administrative areas and the populations\nfor both gender and each age group were calculated.\nThe future population of the 38 administrative areas\nwas projected using a cohort estimation method and the\npopulation estimation model developed by the National\nInstitute of Population and Social Security, Japan [37]. A\nlocal fertility rate of 1.22 for Niigata City was used to\nestimate future populations. Populations in census small\nareas were projected in accordance with population\ngrowth rate of the 38 administrative areas in which the\ncensus small areas were located.\nGeographical analysis\nNetwork analyses calculate the distances and travel\ntimes between locations or points on linear networks\nsuch as roads. Sets of locations are often described as\n\u2018origin and destination\u2019 or \u2018supply and demand\u2019. Com-\nmon applications include route finding, identifying the\nclosest facility and the calculation of isochrones (travel\ntime zones). In this study, census small area centroids\nwith counts of actual and predicted cases were the\n\u2018demand\u2019 points and the ambulance stations were the\n\u2018supply\u2019 points. Network distance between the 2076 cen-\nsus centroids and 35 potential ambulance stations were\ncalculated with Network Analyst (ESRI, USA). A matrix\nof distances from each location to each census area was\ngenerated for each time period. The distance matrices\nand counts of actual and predicted ambulance cases\nwere used as input into Genetic Algorithm (GA, as\ndescribed below), for the 35 potential ambulance loca-\ntions using the R statistics software (The R Foundation\nfor Statistical Computing, http:\/\/www.R-project.org).\nThe average time from current and GA modelled opti-\nmal ambulance locations to EMS cases were compared\nin order to quantify the benefit of optimising locations.\nAn average road speed of 30 km\/h was used after con-\nsultation with local ambulance service management. The\nEMS case records indicate whether the responding\nambulance was the nearest, 2nd nearest, 3rd nearest, et\ncetera. A network analysis calculated the average times\nof the 27 current and 27 optimal ambulances to the\nindividual EMS cases, taking account of which ambu-\nlance responded.\nThe catchment areas for each ambulance location\n(current and optimal) were identified from the census\nsmall areas. The network analysis identified the nearest\nmodelled ambulance location for each census area\nwhich indicated the ambulance catchment. Catchment\nSasaki et al.

For example, consider a 10 km by 10\nkm area with a possible location in each 100 m cell and\nan objective to identify the best 25 locations evaluated\nagainst some criteria. The combinations of possible\nsolutions to evaluate even for such a small area and a\nsmall planning problem are too large to compute by\nbrute force:\n10000\n25 10000 25\n4 415 35684\n!\n! ( ! !)\n. .\uf0b4 \uf02d \uf03d \uf02be  permutations\nGAs create a set of potential of solutions (or \u2018genes\u2019)\ncalled a \u2018chromosome\u2019. Pairs of chromosomes form indi-\nviduals and are evaluated against some \u2018fitness\u2019 criteria\nto assess performance. If the criteria are met genes are\ninterchanged and another generation of solutions is\nbred in a \u2018crossover\u2019. The process of creating new indivi-\nduals from successful parents continues usually for a\npredetermined number of cycles or until some conver-\ngence criteria are met. In order to protect against stag-\nnation or in-breeding, mutation is introduced at regular\nintervals to add some random genes. In this way the GA\nbreeds solutions by creating \u2018fitter\u2019 offspring and hence\nthe analogy with natural selection: crossover creates new\nchromosomes from successful ones, and mutation\nensures diversity. The technical details of the develop-\nment of the modified grouping GA used in this work\nare reported elsewhere and the code may be provided\non request.\nIn this analysis optimal current and optimal future\nambulance locations were compared. The GA was used\nto determine sets of n= 2 to n= 50 ambulance locations\nfrom 175 potential locations using current and predicted\nEMS demand. The GA ran for 1500 iterations and the\nevaluation of fitness was based on minimising the net-\nwork distance weighted by EMS case number (i.e. \u2018case\u2019\nor person distances) from each census small area to the\nnearest potential ambulance location.\nResults\nPredicted EMS cases\nThe age and gender distribution of 21,211 emergency\ncases indicated that the age group of 75 years and over\naccounted for more than 30% of the total emergency\ncases (Table 1). The number of monthly users per 1,000\npopulation among young age groups from 15 to 54\nyears were almost similar, whereas, the monthly users of\nage groups over 55 years increased incrementally. Male\npercentages and monthly users were greater than\nfemale.\nThe stepwise linear regression analysis on the associa-\ntion between the number of emergency cases and demo-\ngraphic and social variables indicated that the age\ngroups of 0 to 4 years (b = 0.006, Standard error (SE)\n0.001, P < 0.001), 15 to 64 years (b = 0.021, SE 0.006, P\n< 0.01) and 80 years and over (b = 0.102, SE 0.006 P <\n0.001), as well as the number of companies with more\nthan five employees (b = 0.433, SE 0.013, P < 0.001),\nwere statistically associated with number of cases. The\npredicted model provided a significant fit to the empiri-\ncal data with a coefficient of multiple determination R2\n= 0.71.\nThe projected populations from 2015 to 2040 showed\nthat total population would decrease from approxi-\nmately 814,000 in 2005 to 699,000 in 2040 (Figure 1).\nThe population of age groups of \u20180-4 years\u2019 and \u201815-64\nyears\u2019 were estimated to decrease, whereas the projected\npopulation of age groups of \u201865 and over\u2019, and \u201880 and\nover\u2019 as a significant predictor of EMS demands were\npredicted to increase.

The cur-\nrent distribution of 27 ambulances is shown in Figure\n2b. The GA was used to identify alternative sets of\nambulance locations from the 35 potential sites based\non current EMS cases. The results in Figure 2c indicate\nthat current ambulance locations could be improved to\nbetter serve current needs by re-allocating resources.\nThe results of the GA suggest that four ambulances out\nof 27, three in the urban north and one in the south\nwest, could be reallocated from the more rural areas in\nthe south of the city in (Figure 2b, 2c). The analysis of\nfuture optimal locations was based on predicted cases\nfor 2030, when EMS demands were predicted to reach a\npeak. There are different patterns of resource allocation\nin the more urban areas (which are northerly and with\nsmaller catchments) compared to optimal location based\non current emergency cases and to the current ambu-\nlance distribution. Comparison with 2007 indicates that\nsome of those ambulance locations in peri-urban areas,\nrejected in 2007, may be needed in 2030 (Figure 2d).\nThe benefit of optimising ambulance location was\nquantified in terms of travel time using a network analy-\nsis. Travel times cases from the set of optimised loca-\ntions to current emergency cases were compared with\nthose from current ambulance locations. Average times\nwere reduced by 57 seconds from the current\nFigure 1 Estimated and future demands of prehospital medical emergency services from 2010 to 2040.

Of the actual EMS cases, 67.8%\nwere attended by their nearest ambulance, whereas\nwhen optimally located, simulation analysis indicated\nthat 83.0% of the cases were be covered by their nearest\nambulance.\nThe ambulance locations identified by the GA were\nevaluated to highlight which were under- or over-used\nbased on the number of actual and predicted cases and\ntheir distances to them. The total person distances in\neach ambulance catchment were calculated from the\nnumber of cases in each census area and the distance\nfrom census area centroid to ambulance location. This\nprovides an index of ambulance station \u2018busyness\u2019 and\naccounts for the number of cases and the distances. By\nway of example Figure 3 compares the demand and\nlocation of n = 25 and n = 30 ambulances in 2007 and\nin 2030 (these numbers were chosen to illustrate the\ndifferences around the current 27 ambulances). The\nincreased demand is evident in 2030 in both cases and\nchanging spatial distribution of demand could be used\nto prioritise additional ambulance facilities at specific\nlocations. Figure 3 shows a pattern of increased ambu-\nlance demand (describing distances and cases) in the\nperi-urban areas for 2030 compared to the current dis-\ntribution of demand. In some instances the GA has sug-\ngested ambulance locations, where the catchment does\nnot include large person distances, but where an ambu-\nlance is still needed. In others, locations are close\ntogether but still expected to be busy.\nDiscussion\nReallocation of ambulances to optimal locations has the\npotential to improve service delivery. Response time is a\ncrucial determinant to survival of life-threatening emer-\ngency events. Studies on the effect of the reducing\nambulance response times on survival rates have argued\nFigure 2 Emergency cases and current and optimal ambulance locations with their catchment areas. a) Distribution of emergency cases\nand 35 fire stations (potential ambulance locations). b) Current location of 27 ambulances. c) The optimal location of 27 ambulance stations\nbased on emergency cases in 2007. d) The optimal location of 27 ambulance stations based on predicted emergency cases for 2030.

International Journal of Health Geographics 2010, 9:4\nhttp:\/\/www.ij-healthgeographics.com\/content\/9\/1\/4\nPage 6 of 10\nthat mortality risk is sensitive to response times of less\nthan 5 minutes [4]. Additional survival benefit is not\nassociated with improved response times beyond this\nfigure. Therefore, allocation of ambulances able to reach\npotential emergency cases in their catchment areas\nwithin 5 minutes is of great importance. In our study\nthe optimal locating ambulances reduced the estimated\naverage response times from 5 minutes 21 seconds to 4\nminutes 24 seconds and increased the percentages of\nthe deployment of ambulances nearest to the scene\nfrom 67.8% to 83.0%. Allocating ambulances to areas of\nhigh EMS need reduces the possibility more distant\nambulances being deployed. The deployment percen-\ntages of the nearest ambulance and reduced response\ntimes indicate more efficient ambulance utilisation.\nIn this analysis, potential ambulance locations were\nidentified by minimizing the person-distance to the\nambulance station. Determining ambulance \u2018demand\u2019 at\ndifferent times provides evidence to support planning\nand allows optimal location strategies at different times\nto be compared. Future service demand was modelled\nby relating current cases to demographic data and\napplying that relationship to predicted population\nchanges. We note that the current optimal locations\nmay be different from future optimal locations. Provid-\ning planners with a time series of EMS (or other service)\ndemands based on predictive models that indicate the\nservice resources that are required, allows holistic ana-\nlyses of the costs and benefits of any re-allocation strat-\negy over time.\nThe approach adopted by this research summarised\nEMS case data over census areas. Using census areas\nallowed EMS data to be correlated with demographic\nvariables, which in turn enabled future emergency cases\nto be predicted and facilitated a GIS-based network ana-\nlysis. The application of a genetic algorithm to deter-\nmine network distances between service \u2018supply\u2019 and\npatient \u2018demand\u2019 points allowed optimal service loca-\ntions to be modelled. In this case the evaluation criter-\nion was to minimise \u2018case distances\u2019 and the benefits of\nservice relocation were quantified in terms of reduced\nambulance response times. We note that i) the results\nprovide evidence to support planning decisions, ii) the\nmethod can be adjusted to accommodate different sets\nor types of service locations, iii) census areas provide a\nconvenient spatial unit over which to summarise other\ndata, and iv) different sets of evaluation criteria could be\nselected according to local priorities. These include the\nFigure 3 A comparison of the optimised location for n = 25 (left) and n = 30 (right) ambulances. These are evaluated against current\nemergency cases in 2007 (top) and predicted emergency cases in 2030 (bottom). The size of the point indicates the \u2018demand\u2019 in terms of\nemergency case distances.\nSasaki et al.

There is\na survival benefit from minimising response time for\npatients with intermediate or high risk of mortality [5].\nScreening EMS cases for the level of severity (triage) in\norder to deploy rapid and intensive ambulances to life-\nthreatening medical events will further reduce inefficient\nambulance utilization. Studies on the appropriateness of\nambulance transportation suggested that between 28%\nand 44% of ambulance transportation were considered as\nunnecessary emergency services [38,39]. In the United\nStates, field triage systems and criteria for screening\nemergency events have been established and several eva-\nluation studies have been conducted for further develop-\nment [40-42]. In some countries, EMS systems have\ndeveloped posting strategies that position ambulance to\nbe in close proximity to emergency calls within high\ndemand service areas during peak hours [4]. In this study\nseverity categorisation of the cases was not applied, how-\never, further analysis on allocation of optimal ambulance\nfor different level of severity has been undertaken.\nFurther work will also consider the temporal fluxes\ninvolved in ambulance demand.\nMonitoring population trends (age groups) are of impor-\ntance when estimating EMS demands as those demands\nwill increase in the future as the population ages. Our\nstudy supports the view that, for the population beyond\nmiddle age, the utilization of EMS increases exponentially\nwith age [13,14,43]. The population of over 80 years is a\nsignificant predictor of EMS demands compared to other\nage groups due to increased risk of life-threatening disease\nsuch as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Analy-\nsis at the census area level allows the impacts of predicted\npopulation changes to be evaluated.\nWe note that this study has several limitations and\nthat improving some of the data aspects may improve\nthe modelled outputs. The EMS data and census data\nare not concurrent which is necessarily the case for\nnearly all studies that involve the use of census data.\nThe assumption when using census has to be that the\npopulation fluxes are not significantly large in compari-\nson to the other phenomena for which data have been\ncollected (e.g. EMS cases). The emergency case data was\nfor a period of 9 months and may not be representative.\nHowever, since seasonal difference of geographic distri-\nbution for the period was limited, we assume that the\nresults of the optimal location are valid to emergency\nevents. The number of companies with more than five\nemployees was identified as a significant positive deter-\nminant for EMS demand prediction. We used data from\nthe national enterprises census of 2008, and that may\nresult in overestimation of EMS future demands since\noverall population was estimated to decrease. Further\nwork is required to estimate EMS future demands with\nconsideration of social, business and city planning indi-\ncators. It is possible to identify a number of other\npotential limitations: the road network does not account\nfor the traffic density patterns in space and time; road\nnetwork distances were used to estimate improved EMS\nresponse as a result of re-allocation; and future EMS\ndemands were based on linear projections. We can pre-\nsent arguments for these choices based on pragmatism:\nit was beyond the scope of this project to capture data\non traffic density; we sought to make a like for like\ncomparison of travel times; we have no indication that\nthe relationships amongst the variables correlated with\nEMS are not linear. Such criticisms could be used to\nconstruct an argument for improved data collection in\nwhich case the method and results we present in this\nwork demonstrate a proof of concept, although the sen-\nsitivity of the results indicate consistent trends regard-\nless of the number of ambulances and the underpinning\ncurrent and projected EMS cases.\nMeasuring and predicting physical access to services\nsuch as public health is important for service delivery\nand for planning future requirements. In this work we\nfound census areas to provide a convenient unit over\nwhich to summarise point data and to integrate other\ndata (socio-economic, demographic, etc). Network ana-\nlysis using census area centroids to analyse access to\nfacilities extends this functionality. Statistical and spatial\nanalyses can then be used to determine how well differ-\nent social groups are served by those facilities [44] and\nhow those facilities could be re-arranged to better serve\ntargeted social groups [35]. The combination of stan-\ndard techniques that incorporate demographic data, GIS\nnetwork analysis and spatial statistical techniques have\nbeen shown to answer complex problems in a number\nof planning domains.\nConclusions\nRe-allocation of ambulances contributes to improved\nresponse times to the scene. Since response time is critical\nfactor to survival rates of life-threatening emergency cases,\nreducing the response time has the potential to improve\npatient survival. The methods used in this work can be\napplied to quantify and optimise location, number and\nphysical access for any type of health facilities and for any\ntarget demographic group. Such evaluations are increas-\ningly important for planning future health service require-\nments and locations, as well to demonstrate the equity of\nservice being delivered especially in the public sector.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the Japanese Society for the Promotion of\nScience for the short-term fellowship awarded to Alexis Comber, the\nSasaki et al.
