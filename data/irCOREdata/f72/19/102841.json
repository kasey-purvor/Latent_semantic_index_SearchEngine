Silva\nSchool of Electronic Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, GU2 5XH, United Kingdom\n~Received 13 July 1998; accepted for publication 17 November 1998!\nThe electron field emission properties of tetrahedral amorphous carbon thin films deposited using a\nfiltered cathodic vacuum arc system have improved as a result of surface treatment with H, O, and\nAr ions. The limiting factor of the emission process does not appear to be only the front surface of\nthe films. The improvement in the emission after ion beam treatment appears to be independent of\nthe ions used. The surface which has been analyzed using ultraviolet photospectroscopy, reflected\nelectron energy loss spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy shows evidence of the\ncreation of segregated sp2 and sp3 rich regions of less than 20 nm in dimension. An extension to\nthe space charge-induced band bending model including a multistep emission process that occurs in\nthis mixed phase material is proposed. \u00a9 1999 American Institute of Physics.\n@S0003-6951~99!02304-9#The field emission flat panel displays provide significant\ntechnical advantages over active matrix liquid crystal display\n~AMLCD! and other display technologies.1 Much research\neffort has been spent on examining the emission properties\nof cold cathodes of flat carbon films. The carbon cathodes\nthat can be produced with varying degrees of sp3, sp2, and\nsp1 hybridizations means that these films can be tuned for\nparticular applications.2 It also means that these films can be\nproduced with a whole gamut of different properties result-\ning in the difficulties to propose a single model to explain the\nemission mechanism. A number of models have been pro-\nposed based on the negative electron affinity,3 defect bands\nin diamond,4 space charge induced band bending,5 surface\ndipole controlled emission,6 and field enhancement due to\nsurface features.7 Although they can be used to fit some\nemission data from different types of films, none of them is\nuniversally acceptable.\nIn this letter, the enhancement in electron emission on\nion beam surface treated ta-C films is analyzed and a model\nto explain the observed emission is proposed.\nThe tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) films were\nprepared using the FCVA technique.8 n11-Si was used as\nthe substrate (r;0.02 V cm). During deposition, the Carbon\nion energy of 100 eV was used to optimize the sp3 ratio up\nto ;87% in the undoped films.8 A RF ion beam source\nproducing 100 eV, 20 mA nitrogen ion beam was used to\nincorporate nitrogen in the growing ta-C films.10 Undoped\nta-C films exhibit a band gap of ;2.6 eV11 and the Fermi\nlevel 0.35 eV below the midgap.10 When nitrogen is incor-\nporated, the Fermi level shifts towards conduction band cor-\nresponding to weak doping in the films (n-ta-C).10\nBoth doped and undoped ta-C films of 40 nm thickness\nwere subjected to 1 min of ion beam surface treatment by\nhydrogen, oxygen, and argon ions ~100 eV and 20 mA!.

Redistribution subject to AIP larea for which the ion bombardment occurred is about 5 cm\nin diameter. After the surface treatment, we transferred the\nfilms to the field emission test chamber by breaking the\nvacuum. In the transfer process, the films were exposed to air\nfor less than half an hour. The electron field emission current\ndensity versus macroscopic electric field (J \u2013 E) were ob-\ntained by using a typical pin to plane measurement.11 The\nemission sites were observed and recorded by using a plane\nto plane measurement and a digital camera.

The saturation current density also im-\nproves by about an order of magnitude in both cases. The\nemission sites over a 4 mm31 mm surface area for undoped\nta-C films is shown in Fig. 2~a!. Higher emission site den-\nsities were observed for n-ta-C films shown in Fig. 2~b!.\nAfter the surface treatment, the emission site densities were\ngreatly improved, as shown in Figs. 2~c!\u20132~e!. The improve-\nment over the site density appears to be independent on the\ntypes of ions used. This observation is confirmed by the\nsame degree of improvement in the J \u2013 E curves recorded\nand shown in Fig. 1 after hydrogen ~j!, oxygen ~l!, and\nargon ~m! ion treatment on ta-C films.\nThe UPS spectra for the as-deposited and ion beam\ntreated n-ta-C films are shown in Fig. 3.

UPS spectra for the untreated and Ar ion surface treated n1-ta-C\nfilms.loaded 04 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP lsignificant number of electrons are ejected under ultraviolet\nirradiation, at about 4 eV with a significantly smaller defect\nstate appearing to supply electrons gradually from about 2 to\n3 eV. This smaller feature may be due to emission from\nlocalized states within the band gap of the ta-C films, and\nindicating that the electron affinity of the material is close to\n2 eV for this film, while the completely filled electronic\nstates of the undoped material, i.e., the intrinsic Fermi level,\nis at 4 eV. This appears to be consistent with electron affinity\ncalculations by Robertson12 as well as the activation energies\nmeasured for the intrinsic ta-C thin films.9 After the ion\nbeam treatment, a large shoulder with a sharp turn-on was\nobserved as shown in Fig. 3. Photoelectrons start to emit at\nenergies as low as about 0.6 eV. It appears to indicate that\nthere are surface modifications which give rise to an apparent\nFermi level very close to vacuum level. UPS signals of simi-\nlar value are observed for diamond surfaces. It indicates that\nregions of the film surface may be transformed from an sp3\nrich amorphous phase to one more closely related to a 100%\nsp3 network as also observed in crystalline diamond.\nTo further assess the surface modifications, REELS was\nemployed on the same samples. Reference REELS curves for\nthe main forms of carbon together with that for the untreated\nand treated n-ta-C films obtained in this study are shown in\nFig. 4. It is immediately apparent that in the case of graphite,\na large p* peak is observed at close to 6 eV energy loss.\nWhile in diamond, this p* peak is absent. When the ion\nbeam treated ta-C sample is compared to the untreated one,\nthere is a slight increase in the p* region, accompanied by a\n3 eV downward shift in the low loss plasmon peak. The\ndownshift in the plasmon peak generally indicates a reduc-\ntion in the electron valence density, and in this case this\ncould indicate a decrease in the film density of the surface\nlayers by as much as 20%. If this was purely due to the\ntransformation of sp3 bonds to sp2 hybridizations, a signifi-\ncantly larger than observed increase in p* region would be\nexpected. Therefore, the decrease in the surface layer density\ncannot be totally attributed to the formation of sp2 bonds.\nNeither does it clarify the the formation of small regions of\n\u2018\u2018crystalline diamond,\u2019\u2019 as indicated by UPS data.\nThe morphological images were then studied by STM as\nFIG. 4.

The mirror smooth samples with\na RMS roughness of 0.193 nm before ion beam treatment\nwas transformed into films having rms roughnesses of 0.242\nnm, with visible nanoscale regions or protrusions formed on\nthe surface within the slightly receded network. This textur-\ning explains the decrease in the volumetric measure of the\nsurface density obtained by REELS. Combined with the UPS\ndata it is quite plausible that some of the \u2018\u2018textured\u2019\u2019 regions\nobserved on the surface of the ion treated n-ta-C films are\nactually nanocrystalline diamond regions formed under in-\ntense ion bombardment.\nThe REELS analysis indicates an increase in the overall\nsp2 content. The UPS shows evidence for the formation of\nsurface crystalline sp3 regions after the ion bombardment.\nSTM observations add further visual evidence for the forma-\ntion of nanoclustered regions on the film surface. The lack of\ndependence on the elemental ion used indicates that the sur-\nface termination of the film is less significant than previously\ndiscussed in the model proposed by Robertson,6 where hy-\ndrogen or oxygen termination was meant to help or impede\nthe electron emission process by creating dipoles at the sur-\nface thus changing the electron affinity of the film. The band\nbending hot electron model5 was extended to polycrystalline\ndiamond films based on a two stage emission process con-\ntrolled by the grain boundaries.13 The electron emission from\nta-C films also appears to support this model, where the\ndependence of the threshold field on the doping of the sub-\nstrate as well as its doping level was clearly shown by Cheah\nand Shi et al.13 The current work helps extend the concept of\nthe two stage emission process for the polycrystalline dia-\nmond films to a multiple step emission process for carbon\nfilms whose surface has both sp3 and sp2 rich nonclustered\nregions.\nThe electrons that are heated when traversing down the\nfully depleted bulk n-ta-C film come to the surface with two\npossible options: they may be emitted straight from the sur-\nface if they gather enough kinetic energy; or they could re-\nside at the surface of the films in either the sp2 or sp3 rich\nclusters. The electrons in sp2 rich clusters could then be\naccelerated by the fully deleted junction between sp2 and\nsp3 rich clusters due to the presence of the potential energy\nvariations of the mixed phase and injected to sp3 rich re-\ngions. Since these sp3 clustered regions possess much lower\nelectron affinities compared to the sp2 rich regions, it willloaded 04 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP lprovide an efficient route for electrons to vacuum. The im-\nplication of this research also points to the fact that there will\nbe significantly less hysteresis, as found in this study, present\nin cathodes based on ion beam treated ta-C, with little or no\nconditioning required before emission at low electric fields.\nControllable segregation of nanoclustered two phase materi-\nals may be a route to producing well behaved cold cathodes\nin the future.\nIn summary, ta-C films before and after various ion\nbeam surface treatment have been investigated. Different\nions give similar degree of reduction in the on-set electric\nfield and similar degree of increase in saturation emission\ncurrent density and emission site density. The ion beam irra-\ndiation provides an effective means to transform the ta-C\nfilm surface into well segregated sp2 and sp3 rich regions.\nAccording to our proposed multiple step emission mecha-\nnism the junction between sp2 and sp3 rich clusters provides\nan intermediate ladder for the electrons to climb up from the\nsp2 rich clusters to sp3 rich ones where they may have\nenough energy to overcome the small barrier to emit to\nvacuum.\nX.
