INTRODUCTION\nOver the last decade, no one single issue seems to have occupied the minds of\nEuropean company lawyers more than the question as to what extent com-\npanies formed under the law of a Member State may be able to enjoy the right\nto freedom of establishment. Three judgments handed down by the European\nCourt of Justice at the turn of the millennium\u2014Centros,1 U\u00a8berseering2 and\nInspire Art3\u2014triggered an unprecedented amount of scholarly attention across\nEurope.4 Despite this intensive academic debate and a number of follow-up\n* Lecturer in Law, London School of Economics and Political Science.\n** Lecturer in International Commercial and Financial Law, School of Law, King\u2019s College\nLondon.

However, those who expected clari-\nfication will be bitterly disappointed. Instead of consolidating the right to\nfreedom of establishment, the Court, in a judgment that in its English version\nis at times barely comprehensible, introduces new subtleties and complexities\nwhich will render freedom of establishment for companies a rather ineffective\ntool for the establishment of the Internal Market.\nThis article analyses the implications of Cartesio in light of different sce-\nnarios of transfer of the registered and the real seat within the European\nUnion. It assesses the interrelations of right of establishment and private\ninternational law rules for the determination of the law applicable to com-\npanies and concludes that the case law of the European Court of Justice after\nCartesio, rather than providing for a coherent system of European company\nlaw, leads to arbitrary distinctions and significantly impedes the free move-\nment of companies.\nII. FROM DAILY MAIL TO SEVIC\nWhere a company6 that was validly formed in a Member State (A) where\nit has its registered office is, according to the law of a second Member\nState (B), treated as having transferred to Member State (B) its central\nadministration or principal place of business, the rules that Member State (B)\nimposes on and applies to the company will be subject to the right to freedom\nof establishment.7 Freedom of establishment can also be invoked by \u2018a com-\npany that was formed in one Member State only for the purpose of estab-\nlishing itself in a second Member State where its main or indeed entire\nbusiness is to be conducted.\u20198 This is definitely the case where the com-\npany\u2019s business in the second Member State is conducted via a registered\nRules in Company Law after U\u00a8berseering: An Economic and Comparative Analysis of the\nAllocation of Policy Competence in the European Union\u2019 (2003) 4 EBOR 301; P Oliver and\nW-H Roth, \u2018The Internal Market and the four Freedoms\u2019 (2004) 41 CMLR 407; A Looijestijn-\nClearie, \u2018Have the Dikes Collapsed?

Finally, cross-border merger operations have been held to\n\u2018constitute particular methods of exercise of the freedom of establishment,\nimportant for the proper functioning of the internal market\u2019.12 Thus, Member\nStates are prevented from treating a merger between companies differently\ndepending on the internal or cross-border nature of the merger.13\nWhat remained unresolved until now was the question of whether pro-\nvisions of the Member State of incorporation which rendered the departure of\na company impossible or more burdensome were also subject to freedom of\nestablishment scrutiny. In Daily Mail14 the Court held that \u2018in the present state\nof Community law\u2019, articles 49, 54 Treaty on the Functioning of the European\nUnion (TFEU) (ex-articles 43, 48 EC) \u2018cannot be interpreted as conferring on\ncompanies incorporated under the law of a Member State a right to transfer\ntheir central management and control and their central administration to\nanother Member State while retaining their status as companies incorporated\nunder the legislation of the first Member State.\u2019 After U\u00a8berseering15 and\nInspire Art,16 this statement could claim validity only in respect of the \u2018rela-\ntions between a company and the Member State under the laws of which it had\nbeen incorporated\u2019 and whose laws restricted the company\u2019s mobility. For this\nparticular situation, neither in U\u00a8berseering nor in Inspire Art did the Court in\nany way depart from Daily Mail. Rather, the Court seemed to differentiate\nbetween the question of applicability of freedom of establishment, on the one\nhand, and the preliminary question of whether the company was validly\nformed, and remained in existence, under the law of a Member State, on the\nother. This is because \u2018unlike natural persons, companies are creatures of the\nlaw and, in the present state of Community law, creatures of national law.\nThey exist only by virtue of the varying national legislation which determines\ntheir incorporation and functioning.\u201917\n9 Eleventh Council Directive 89\/666\/EEC of 21 December 1989 concerning disclosure\nrequirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company\ngoverned by the law of another State [1989] OJ L 395\/36.\n10 Centros (n 1) para 17; Inspire Art (n 3) para 97.\n11 Inspire Art (n 3) para 95\u201396.\n12 Case C-411\/03 SEVIC Systems AG [2005] ECR I-10805 para 19.\n13 SEVIC (n 12) para 31.\n14 Case 81\/87 The Queen v HM Treasury and Commissioners of Inland Revenue, ex parte\nDaily Mail and General Trust plc [1988] ECR 5483 para 24.\n15 U\u00a8berseering (n 2) para 61\u201373. 16 Inspire Art (n 3) 103.\n17 Daily Mail (n 14) para 19.\nMysteries of Freedom of Establishment After Cartesio 305\nDoubts were raised in Lasteyrie du Sallaint where the ECJ held that arti-\ncle 49 TFEU (ex-article 43 EC) \u2018also prohibits the Member State of origin\nfrom hindering the establishment in another Member State of one of its own\nnationals\u2019 and consequently precludes a Member State from establishing,\nin order to prevent a risk of tax avoidance, a mechanism for taxing as yet\nunrealized increases in value, where a taxpayer transfers his tax residence\noutside that State.18 However, the case did not represent a clear departure from\nDaily Mail because it dealt with a natural person whose legal and natural\nexistence clearly does not depend on the legal order of its home Member State.\nIn Marks & Spencer the Court went one step further and held that the\nprovisions concerning freedom of establishment also \u2018prohibit the Member\nState of origin from hindering the establishment in another Member\nState . . . of a company incorporated under its legislation.\u201919 A national rule\nwhich allows a parent company to set-off losses incurred by resident sub-\nsidiaries, but not the losses incurred by subsidiaries incorporated in another\nMember State, was found to constitute a restriction20 to freedom of estab-\nlishment by deterring the parent company \u2018from setting up subsidiaries in\nother Member States.\u201921 Again, the Daily Mail reasoning remained unscathed\nbecause the setting up by a company incorporated in one Member State of a\nsubsidiary in another Member State (secondary establishment) does not affect\nthe parent company\u2019s existence as a \u2018creature of the law\u2019 of the Member State\nof incorporation.\nAs for the cross border merger context, the Court\u2019s decision in SEVIC\nseemed to suggest that the different treatment of a merger that involves a\nforeign company as compared to a purely domestic merger always amounts to\na restriction of the right of establishment irrespective of whether the different\ntreatment emanates from the Member State of the absorbing entity or the\nMember State of the absorbed entity.22 This appeared to signal a significant\ndeparture from Daily Mail, at least as far as discriminatory measures were\nconcerned. However, the fact remains that in SEVIC registration was refused\nby the Member State of the absorbing entity and, therefore, arguably by the\ncountry of destination.\n18 Case C-9\/02 Lasteyrie du Saillant [2004] ECR I-2409 para 42.\n19 Case C-446\/03 Marks & Spencer plc v HM\u2019s Inspector of Taxes [2005] ECR I-10837\npara 31.\n20 The Court held that the restriction was justified to the extent that the losses incurred by the\nnon-resident subsidiary could be taken into account in the subsidiary\u2019s State of residence.\n21 Marks & Spencer (n 19) para 33.\n22 SEVIC (n 12) para 31: \u2018Articles 43 EC and 48 EC preclude registration in the national\ncommercial register of the merger by dissolution without liquidation of one company and transfer\nof the whole of its assets to another company from being refused in general in a Member State\nwhere one of the two companies is established in another Member State, whereas such registration\nis possible, . . . , where the two companies participating in the merger are both established in the\nterritory of the first Member State.\u2019\n306 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nIn light of these uncertainties and in order \u2018to improve the efficiency and\ncompetitive position of European companies by providing them with the\npossibility of transferring their registered office more easily\u2019 so that they\ncan \u2018choose a legal environment that best suits their business needs\u2019 the\nCommission contemplated a directive on the cross border transfer of a com-\npany\u2019s registered office.23 However, following a consultation process, the\nCommission\u2019s impact assessment concluded that it was not clear whether\nadopting a directive would represent the least onerous way of achieving the\nobjectives pursued. The Commission argued that the practical impact of\nthe existing legislation on cross-border mobility24 was not yet known and the\nissue of the transfer of the \u2018registered office\u2019 might be clarified by the Court in\nCartesio.25 Following the impact assessment, Commissioner McCreevy de-\ncided there was no need for action at EU level. DG Internal Market and\nServices has therefore stopped work on legislation in this area.\nIII. CARTESIO\nThe Cartesio case was enveloped in the mist of confusion right from the start.\nAccording to the English translation of the reference for a preliminary ruling,\nthe Hungarian court seemed to ask whether a company that wished to transfer\nits \u2018registered office\u2019 to another Member State could invoke the right to free-\ndom of establishment. The German translation referred to the\u2018Sitz\u2019 of the com-\npany, the French translation to the\u2018sie`ge social\u2019. Under the Companies Act\n2006, the \u2018registered office\u2019 is relevant as the place where documents may be\nserved26 andwhere a companymay keep registers and certain documents for in-\nspection.27 It does not have to be located where the company has its operational\nheadquarters or principal place of business. Conversely,\u2018Sitz\u2019 in Germany28\n23 The Report of the High Level Group of Company Law Experts on a Modern Regulatory\nFramework for Company Law in Europe, Brussels, 2002, 20, urged the Commission to bring\nforward a revised proposal for a Fourteenth Directive on the Transfer of the Registered Office.\nIn its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on modernising company law\nand enhancing corporate governance in the European Union\u2014A plan to move forward,\nCOM(2003)284 final, 20, the Commission expressed its intention to present a new proposal for a\nFourteenth Directive in the short term.\n24 Directive 2005\/56\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on\ncross-border mergers of limited liability companies [2005] OJ L310\/1.\n25 Commission Staff Working Document: Impact assessment on the Directive on the cross-\nborder transfer of registered office, 12.12.2007, SEC(2007) 1707, 5\u20136.\n26 Companies Act 2006, s 1139(1).\n27 Companies Act 2006, s 1136. Alternatively, the records may be kept at some other place\npermitted by regulations to be made under Companies Act 2006, s 1136.\n28 GmbHG, \u00b7 4a(2); AktG, \u00b7 5(2), as in force until 30 October 2008. In light of the right to\nfreedom of establishment and in order to create a level playing field for domestic companies,\nGermany has already changed its law in this respect. Since 1 November 2008, German private and\npublic companies may choose their operational headquarters freely within the Community. Only\nthe registered office as stipulated in the articles of association must be situated in Germany.\ncf Gesetzentwurf der Bundesregierung: Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Modernisierung des\nMysteries of Freedom of Establishment After Cartesio 307\nand \u2018sie`ge social\u2019 in France29 traditionally have to coincide with the place\nfrom where the company is actually being run. The English translation of the\nreference seems to have influenced the Commission\u2019s impact assessment\nwhere it was assumed that Cartesio was about the transfer of the \u2018registered\noffice\u2019.30 It also prompted the Irish government to request the re-opening of the\noral procedure31 after Advocate General Maduro had delivered his opinion\nbased on a transfer of the real seat. 32\nHowever, from the Advocate General\u2019s opinion the facts seem to be\nreasonably clear: Cartesio was a limited partnership formed in accordance\nwith Hungarian law and registered in Hungary. When it submitted an appli-\ncation to the commercial court to amend its registration in the local com-\nmercial register so as to register an address in Italy as its new operational\nheadquarters, the court rejected the application on the ground that Hungarian\nlaw did not permit companies to transfer their operational headquarters to\nanother Member State while retaining their legal status as a company gov-\nerned by Hungarian law. In order to change its headquarters, Cartesio would\nhave to dissolve in Hungary first and then re-incorporate under Italian law.\nWhen Cartesio appealed against the decision of the commercial court, the\nCourt of Appeal referred a number of questions to the ECJ for a preliminary\nruling. As far as the right to freedom of establishment is concerned, the\nHungarian court essentially asked whether articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles\n43, 48 EC) are to be interpreted as precluding national legislation which pre-\nvents a company from transferring its operational headquarters to another\nMember State whilst retaining its status as a company governed by the law of\nthe Member State of incorporation.33\nBased on the order for reference, the Advocate General assumes that\nHungarian law is grounded in the \u2018real seat\u2019 theory.34 Under Hungarian law,\nthe place of a company\u2019s operational headquarters is supposed to coincide\nwith its place of incorporation. Thus, Hungarian company law prohibits the\n\u2018export\u2019 of a Hungarian legal person to the territory of another Member State.\nThis, according to Advocate General Maduro, is within the scope of the right\nof establishment.35 The Advocate General\u2019s first argument is essentially\nGmbH-Rechts und zur Beka\u00a8mpfung von Missbra\u00a8uchen (MoMiG), BR-Drucksache 354\/07, 25\nMay 2007, 65, 65 and Gesetz zur Modernisierung des GmbH-Rechts und zur Beka\u00a8mpfung von\nMi\u00dfbra\u00a8uchen (MoMiG), 23.10.2008, BGBl. 2008, I Nr. 48, 2026.

In effect, such rules amount to a discrimination against the exercise\nof freedom of movement.\u201936 In a second step, the Advocate General rejects the\nDaily Mail reasoning37 and refutes efforts which try to distinguish Daily Mail\nfrom Centros, U\u00a8berseering and Inspire Art on the facts.38 Given that the right\nto freedom of establishment \u2018also prohibits the Member State of origin from\nhindering the establishment in another Member State of one of its own\nnationals,\u201939 distinctions based on aspects of primary as opposed to secondary\nestablishment and inbound versus outbound establishment were, according to\nthe Advocate General, never entirely persuasive.40 Under the general ana-\nlytical framework, the Court would not \u2018a priori\u2019 exclude particular areas of\nnational law from the scope of the right of establishment.41 Although Member\nStates were free to organize their national company laws along the lines of real\nseat theory or incorporation theory, freedom of establishment required a\nminimum degree of mutual recognition and coordination of these various\nsystems of rules so that neither theory could be applied to its fullest extent.42\nConsequently, it was\nimpossible, [. . .], to argue on the basis of the current state of Community law that\nMember States enjoy an absolute freedom to determine the \u2018life and death\u2019 of\ncompanies constituted under their domestic law, irrespective of the conse-\nquences for the freedom of establishment. Otherwise, Member States would\nhave carte blanche to impose a \u2018death sentence\u2019 on a company constituted under\nits laws just because it had decided to exercise the freedom of establishment.43\nBecause of the costs and administrative burdens inherent in first having to\nwind up the company in its country of origin and then to re-establish it com-\npletely in the country of destination, national rules that prevent an intra-EU\ntransfer of the operational headquarters amounted to a restriction on freedom\nof establishment.44 This restriction may be justified on grounds of general\npublic interest. However, since the Hungarian rules \u2018completely deny\u2019 a\nHungarian company to transfer its operational headquarters to another\nMember State it was, according to the Advocate General, \u2018difficult to see\nhow such \u201can outright negation of the freedom of establishment\u201d could be\nnecessary for reasons of public interest.\u201945\nThe Court did not follow the path recommended by Advocate General\nMaduro. In fact, it is not entirely clear whether the Court followed any path at\nall. The Court\u2019s starting point is its reasoning in Daily Mail: \u2018[C]ompanies are\n36 ibid para 25. 37 ibid para 26. 38 ibid para 28.\n39 Case C-251\/98 Baars [2000] ECR I-2787, para 28; Case C-9\/02 Lasteyrie du Saillant [2004]\nECR I-2409, para 42, to which AG Maduro (n 32) refers in note 48 of his opinion.\n40 AG Maduro (n 32) para 28. 41 ibid para 30. 42 ibid para 30.\n43 ibid para 31. 44 ibid para 32. 45 AG Maduro (n 32) para 34.\nMysteries of Freedom of Establishment After Cartesio 309\ncreatures of national law and exist only by virtue of the national legislation\nwhich determines [their] incorporation and functioning.\u201946 Article 54 TFEU\n(ex-article 48 EC) takes into account that national laws vary widely as to the\nconnecting factor required for incorporation and the subsequent modification\nof that factor.47 From this, the Court inferred in U\u00a8berseering that a Member\nState could restrict a company\u2019s right to retain its legal personality under its\nlaw when its centre of administration was transferred to a foreign country.48\nMoreover, it considered article 54 TFEU (ex-article 48 EC) to leave the\nquestion of the connecting factor and its subsequent change as unresolved by\nthe rules on freedom of establishment, and to reserve these issues for further\nlegislation.49 Consequently, \u2018in the absence of a uniform Community law\ndefinition of the companies which may enjoy the right of establishment on the\nbasis of a single connecting factor determining the national law applicable to a\ncompany\u2019, the question whether a company actually has the right to freedom\nof establishment is \u2018a preliminary matter which, as Community law now\nstands, can only be resolved by the applicable national law.\u201950\nThus, a Member State has the power, first, to define the connecting factor\nrequired of a company if it is to be regarded as incorporated under the law of\nthat Member State. In this respect, freedom of establishment does not apply.51\nThis seems to follow logically from the Court\u2019s premise quoted above.\nCompanies validly \u2018formed in accordance with the law of a Member State\u2019 are\nto be awarded equal status with natural persons and can rely on freedom of\nestablishment. From the point of view of the company, the definition of the\nconnecting factor (that determines the applicable law) is a matter for national\nlaw and immune from freedom of establishment interference in the same way\nas are domestic substantive and procedural rules on company formation. This\nconceptually clear picture becomes somewhat blurred, however, if one looks\nat it from the perspective of the company\u2019s founders. Their right to freedom of\nestablishment includes the right \u2018to set up . . . companies.\u201952 Article 49 TFEU\n(ex-article 43 EC) confers this right only under the conditions laid down by the\nhost Member State for its own nationals. However, in line with the Court\u2019s\ncase law on the market freedoms in general,53 the ECJ has extended the scope\nof freedom of establishment so as to encompass national measures which are\n\u2018liable to hinder or make less attractive\u2019 the exercise of freedom of estab-\nlishment.54 If the founders could invoke this freedom in order to challenge\n46 Cartesio (n 5) para 104. 47 ibid para 105\u2013106. 48 ibid para 107.\n49 ibid para 108. 50 ibid para 109. 51 ibid para 110.\n52 cf art 49 TFEU (ex-art 43 EC); W Scho\u00a8n, \u2018Niederlassungsfreiheit als Grundungsfreiheit\u2019 in\nP Hommelhoff, P Rawert and K Schmidt (eds), Festschrift fu\u00a8r Hans-Joachim Priester zum 70.\nGeburtstag (Dr Otto Schmidt, Ko\u00a8ln, 2007) 737, 739\u2013743.\n53 Case 8\/74 Dassonville [1974] ECR 873 (free movement of goods); Case C-76\/90 Sa\u00a8ger\n[1991] ECR I-4221 (freedom to provide services); Case C-415\/93 Bosman [1995] ECR I-4921\n(free movement of workers); art 63 TFEU (ex-art 56 EC) explicitly refers to \u2018restrictions on the\nmovement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries\u2019.\n54 Case C-55\/94 Gebhard [1995] ECR I-4165, para 37.\n310 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nthe connecting factor for incorporation required by a Member State, they\ncould equally challenge the substantive rules on company formation. Freedom\nof establishment does not differentiate between substantive law and conflict of\nlaws rules. This would mean the end of national company law as we know it.\nThe content of large areas of substantive company law would have to be\ndeduced directly from freedom of establishment. Therefore, in accordance\nwith the rationale in Keck,55 conflict of laws and substantive company law\nrules that \u2018apply to all relevant traders operating within the national territory\u2019\nand \u2018affect in the same manner, in law and in fact\u2019 domestic entrepreneurs\nand those from other Member States should be deemed to fall outside the\nscope of freedom of establishment. Such provisions do not specifically\nimpede market access by foreign incorporators more than they impede\ncompany formation by domestic ones.56 Thus, so long as applied in a non-\ndiscriminatory manner, substantive company law seems to be safe. As regards\nthe requirement of having the operational head office in the Member State of\nincorporation, it could be argued that it will be more difficult for foreign\nfounders to establish a physical presence in the Member State of incorpor-\nation, thus treating them differently at least in fact. Such a requirement may,\ntherefore, only stand if justified by imperative requirements in the public\ninterest.57\nSecondly, according to the Court, the Member State also has the power to\nprevent a company governed by its law from retaining that status if the com-\npany intends to move its seat to the territory of another Member State,\n\u2018thereby breaking the connecting factor required under the law of incorpor-\nation\u2019.58 This result does not follow logically from the Daily Mail reasoning.\nWith the company established as a legal person it is hard to see why freedom\nof establishment should not apply. The company was formed in accordance\nwith the law of a Member State and would still have its registered office,\ncentral administration or principle place of business within the EU. As a result\nof the Court\u2019s reasoning, Member States are unconstrained by the right to\nfreedom of establishment, not just in respect of the connecting factor for in-\ncorporation and formation, but also in respect of decisions taken by lawfully\nestablished companies to the extent that the company intends to remain sub-\nject to the law of incorporation.\nNow the Court distinguishes this situation (of a company moving its seat to\nanother Member State whilst retaining its status as company under the law of\nthe Member State of origin) from the situation where a company moves to\nanother Member State in order to convert into a company form provided under\nthe law of that Member State.59 In that case, the Member State\u2019s power to\n55 Joined cases C-267 and 268\/91 Keck and Mithouard [1993] ECR I-6097.\n56 cf Case C-384\/93 Alpine Investment BV v Minister van Financie\u00a8n [1995] ECR I-1141,\npara 37. 57 Gebhard (n 54) para 37.\n58 Cartesio (n 5) para 110. 59 ibid para 111.\nMysteries of Freedom of Establishment After Cartesio 311\ndetermine the connecting factor for incorporation and for retaining the status\nof incorporation \u2018cannot . . . justify the Member State of incorporation, by\nrequiring the winding-up or liquidation of the company, in preventing that\ncompany from converting itself into a company governed by the law of the\nother Member State, to the extent that it is permitted under that law to do so.\u201960\nProvisions of the law of the Member State of incorporation that may prevent a\ncompany from converting into a company governed by the law of the host\nMember State amount to a restriction to freedom of establishment which,\nunless justified by overriding requirements in the public interest, will be pro-\nhibited under article 49 TFEU (ex-article 43 EC).61 This result seems to be in\naccordance with, and even to go beyond, the rules the Commission contem-\nplated for a Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the cross-border transfer\nof a company\u2019s registered office. In its online consultation, the Commission\nsuggested that each Member State should recognize the right of a company\ngoverned by its national law to transfer its registered office to another Member\nState in order to acquire a new legal personality. The host Member State\nshould not be allowed to refuse to register a company which satisfies the\nessential substantive and formal requirements for the registration of national\ncompanies. It may however provide as a substantive requirement that the\ncompany\u2019s registered office and operational head office coincide.62 It is also in\nline with the rules governing the transfer of the entity seat to another Member\nState laid down by Regulation 2157\/2001 on the European Company,63 and\nRegulation 1435\/2003 on the European Cooperative Society.64 Under these\nrules an entity can transfer its registered office and its real seat\u2014which both\nmust be situated in the same country65\u2014to another Member State.66 Such a\ntransfer entails a change in the applicable law.67 In fact, the Commission\nargued that the rules that govern the transfer of the seat of these supra-national\nentities could and should be applied \u2018mutatis mutandis\u2019 to the cross-border\ntransfer of the real seat of companies created under domestic law. How-\never, since Cartesio intended to remain a Hungarian company, these\n60 ibid para 112. 61 ibid para 113.\n62 For this consultation process and the Commission\u2019s suggestions cf http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/\ninternal_market\/company\/seat-transfer\/2004-consult_en.htm (last visited 6 April 2009).\n63 Regulation (EC) 2157\/2001 of 10 August 2001 on the Statute for a European Company (SE)\n[2001] OJ L 294\/1, supplemented by Directive 2001\/86\/EC of 10 August 2001 on employee\nparticipation [2001] OJ L 294\/22.\n64 Regulation (EC) No 1435\/2003 of 22 July 2003 on the statute for a European co-operative\nsociety (SCE) [2003] OJ L 207\/1, supplemented by Directive 2003\/72\/EC of 22 July 2003 on\nemployee participation [2003] OJ L 207\/25.\n65 Regulation (EC) 2157\/2001, art 7; Regulation (EC) No 1435\/2003, art 6.\n66 Regulation (EC) 2157\/2001, art 8; Regulation (EC) No 1435\/2003, art 7.\n67 Regulation (EC) 2157\/2001, art 9(1)(c)(ii)(iii); Regulation (EC) No 1435\/2003, art\n8(1)(c)(ii)(iii). Council Regulation (EEC) 2137\/85 of 25 July 1985 on the European Economic\nInterest Grouping (EEIG) [1985] OJ L 199\/1 follows somewhat different rules. Although the\nofficial address must be at the place where the grouping has its central administration or where\none of the members has its central administration (art 12), the official address may be transferred\nwithin the Community with or without change in the applicable law (Art. 13, 14).\n312 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nprovisions\u2014which result in a change in the applicable law\u2014could not be\napplied mutatis mutandis in order to support the applicant\u2019s case.68\nLastly, the Court clarified the ambit of SEVIC. The situation in SEVIC,\naccording to the Court, was not concerned with the question of continuing\nexistence of a company under the law of the Member State of incorporation,\nbut whether or not the company is faced with a restriction in the exercise of its\nright of establishment in another Member State. The situation in SEVIC was\ntherefore similar to the situations in Centros, U\u00a8berseering and Inspire Art69\nand could not be of assistance in a case like Cartesio.\nFor these reasons, the Court held that articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43,\n48 EC) \u2018are to be interpreted as not precluding legislation of a Member State\nunder which a company incorporated under the law of that Member State may\nnot transfer its seat to another Member State whilst retaining its status as a\ncompany governed by the law of the Member State of incorporation.\u201970 This\nruling considerably increases complexity of the right to freedom of estab-\nlishment. Whether a company and its owners and management may rely on\nfreedom of establishment appears to be intrinsically linked to, and dependent\nupon, the structure not just of the conflict of laws rules adopted by the affected\nMember States, but also their substantive company laws.\nIV. APPLICABLE COMPANY LAW MOVES IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS\nWe will now analyse several cases in which a company seeks to transfer\nits real or registered seat from the Member State of incorporation (Member\nState A) to another Member State (Member State B). These cases, which will\nbe based on different combinations of conflict of laws and substantive com-\npany law rules, will show that the criteria developed by the Court of Justice\nto delineate the scope of application of articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43,\n48 EC) lead to arbitrary results and lack an intrinsic justification.\nCase 1: Assume first that Member State A follows the incorporation theory\nand that the company wishes to transfer its real seat to Member State B. This is\nthe case that was decided in Cartesio.71 If the company law of Member State\nA stipulates that the centre of administration of the company must be located\nin A (again as in Cartesio), the real seat cannot be transferred to B without\ndissolution and liquidation of the company.72 If the company law of Member\nState A is more liberal, thus not requiring real seat and registered office to be\nsituated within its territory,73 A\u2019s law does not require dissolution and\nCartesio does not have a bearing on the case. Now the conflict of laws rules of\nthe receiving State are of relevance. Under the incorporation theory, the courts\n68 Cartesio (n 5) para 115\u2013120. 69 ibid 121\u2013123. 70 ibid para 124.\n71 AG Maduro comes to the conclusion that Hungarian company law follows the real seat\ntheory (n 32) para 23. However, this conclusion does not seem to be in accordance with the\nrespective Hungarian provisions. See further (n 97).\n72 cf the holding in Cartesio (n 5) para 110. 73 cf (n 28).\nMysteries of Freedom of Establishment After Cartesio 313\nin Member State B will apply A\u2019s law, consequently treating the company as a\nvalidly incorporated (foreign) legal entity. The real seat theory would lead to a\ndifferent result. The courts in Member State B would apply their own (sub-\nstantive) company law. Since the company was not formed under B\u2019s laws, it\nwould need to dissolve and re-incorporate. However, this consequence has\nbeen enjoined in U\u00a8berseering: A company that has been validly formed under\nthe laws of one Member State and that transfers its real seat to another\nMember State has to be recognized by that second State. Again, the company\nis permitted to retain its character as a company under A\u2019s laws.\nCase 2: The legal situation is different if the company seeks to transfer its\nregistered seat from a Member State applying the incorporation theory (A) to\nanother State (B). As discussed above, the Court of Justice is of the opinion\nthat this case falls within the reach of articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43,\n48 EC). The Member State of incorporation may not require the winding-up or\nliquidation of the company. Instead, the company must be able to convert into\na form of company governed by the law of the other State.74 A receiving\nMember State that follows the incorporation theory will judge the case ac-\ncording to its own company law. It may require re-incorporation of the com-\npany before it can take up business as a valid legal entity in that State. Such\nprohibitive rules are not in contradiction to the right of establishment. First,\nCartesio makes clear that the continued existence of the company is only\nguaranteed, ie articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43, 48 EC) only safeguard\nthe right of a company to convert itself into a company governed by another\nlegal system, to the extent that the law of the receiving State allows the con-\nversion.75 Second, the dictum of U\u00a8berseering is restricted to the case of a\ncompany \u2018which is validly incorporated in one Member State (\u2018A\u2019) in which it\nhas its registered office [and which] is deemed, under the law of a second\nMember State (\u2018B\u2019), to have moved its actual centre of administration to\nMember State B\u2019.76 In other words, the laws of Member State B are not\nreviewed in light of articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43, 48 EC) unless the\nlegal existence of the company in Member State A is established.77\nIf B is a real seat State the analysis is as follows. We assume that the real\nseat of the company has remained in A and the company has applied for\nregistration in B to take advantage of B\u2019s company law, which might be more\nliberal or more suitable for the particular purposes of the company.78\nJurisdiction of the registration court or office is determined in accordance with\n74 Cartesio (n 5) para 112. 75 ibid para 112.\n76 U\u00a8berseering (n 2) para 52. 77 ibid para 63.\n78 This assumption might not be of great practical relevance. Market actors that wish to take\nadvantage of the regulatory regime in B will presumably incorporate in B in the first place and\nconduct all business operations in A, which is the Centros scenario (but cf Oberlandesgericht\n[Higher Regional Court] Zweibru\u00a8cken, Wertpapiermitteilungen (WM) 2005, 2140: transfer of the\nregistered seat of an association formed under French law from France to Germany). However, for\nexpository purposes all alternatives of a transfer of seat shall be analysed in light of the case law of\nthe ECJ.\n314 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nthe procedural law of the State where the court or office is located. Since\nprocedural jurisdiction is a question of public law and, consequently, terri-\ntoriality, the private international law rules of the Member State and the law\napplicable to the company are, at this point of the analysis, irrelevant.79 Thus,\nthe national law of the receiving Member State determines where registration\nafter transfer and conversion into a type of company governed by that State\u2019s\nlaw is permitted. In general, the registration court or office in whose district\nthe (new) registered seat of the company will be located has jurisdiction.80\nHowever, the question of whether transfer of seat and conversion without\ndissolution and re-incorporation is permissible is one of substantive law; ac-\ncordingly, private international law rules determine the applicable law. The\nreal seat State refers to the law of the incorporation State (A), which will\naccept the remission regarding the dissolution of the corporation and probably\nrefer back to B for the question of re-incorporation.81\nNow, Cartesio stipulates that A cannot restrict the movement of the com-\npany from A to B if the transfer entails a change in the applicable law (which\nis, in this example, the case). The company does not need to be wound up, and\nthe company may (depending on B\u2019s company law concerning transfers of\nseat from abroad) be registered in B. Or so it would seem. Consider, as men-\ntioned above, that according to Cartesio A is not allowed to require winding-\nup and liquidation if the company \u2018is permitted under [the] law\u201982 of B to\nconvert. B\u2019s law, on the other hand, applies A\u2019s company law, which would\nrequire dissolution if that was not prohibited under Cartesio. As can be seen,\nthe principles established by the ECJ lead to a circular argument. The con-\nundrum may be solved by assuming that Cartesio refers only to the substan-\ntive law of the receiving State or that B\u2019s remission already implements the\nprinciples of Cartesio, ie does not apply A\u2019s law to the extent that it requires\ndissolution.\nTo summarise, in both cases (transfer of the registered seat from an incor-\nporation theory country to another incorporation theory country or to a real\nseat country) Member State A is enjoined from requiring dissolution, but the\ncompany may need to re-incorporate under the substantive company law of\nMember State B.83 In the second case (transfer into a real seat country) this\n79 cf PMankowski andOLKno\u00a8fel, \u2018Registrierung\u2019 [Registration] in HHirte and TBu\u00a8cker (eds),\nGrenzu\u00a8berschreitende Gesellschaften [Cross-border Corporations] (2nd edn, Carl Heymanns,\nKo\u00a8ln, 2006) \u00b7 13, para 2.\n80 For example Umwandlungsgesetz [Reorganisation of Companies Act], \u00b7 198(2).\n81 cf H-F Mu\u00a8ller, \u2018Internationales Gesellschaftsrecht\u2019 [Private International Company Law] in\nG Spindler and E Stilz (eds), Aktiengesetz [Stock Corporation Act] (CH Beck, Mu\u00a8nchen, 2007)\npara 12. 82 Cartesio (n 5) para 112.\n83 Unless it is argued that the rationale of Centros and Inspire Art requires the receiving\nMember State to allow conversion without re-incorporation. In this direction S. Grundmann,\nEuropa\u00a8isches Gesellschaftsrecht [European Company Law] (CF Mu\u00a8ller, Heidelberg 2004)\npara 779; A Wis\u00b4niewski and A Opalski, \u2018Companies\u2019 Freedom of Establishment after the ECJ\nCartesio Judgment\u2019 (2009) 10 EBOR 595, 615, 618.\nMysteries of Freedom of Establishment After Cartesio 315\nconsequence is, arguably, rather opaque and the reference in Cartesio to the\nlaw of the receiving Member State circular.\nCase 3: The case that raises the most interesting questions is the transfer of\nthe real seat from a real seat country (A) to another country (B) that follows\neither the real seat theory or the incorporation theory. It is questionable what\nimpact articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43, 48 EC) have on the company law\nof Member State A. The Court of Justice in Cartesio did not expressly address\nthis question. However, the holding, when pointing out (in rather obscure\nEnglish) that \u2018the situation where the seat of a company incorporated under the\nlaw of one Member State is transferred to another Member State with no\nchange as regards the law which governs that company [shall] be distinguished\nfrom the situation where a company governed by the law of one Member State\nmoves to another Member State with an attendant change as regards the\nnational law applicable\u2019,84 seems to imply that our case 3 should be solved in\nthe same way as case 2. In both cases, the applicable legal regime changes\u2014in\nthe first scenario through a transfer of the registered seat out of an incorporation\ntheory State, thus altering the factor that determines the applicable law, in the\nsecond scenario through a transfer of the real seat out of a real seat State, again\naltering the determinative factor. Arguably, both cases should be governed by\nthe same principles, ie in both cases theMember State of incorporation may not\nrequire the winding-up or liquidation of the company if the receiving Member\nState allows the change of the applicable law without re-incorporation.\nBefore we proceed with our argument, some terminological difficulties\nneed to be addressed. In Cartesio, the Court of Justice states that \u2018in the\nabsence of a uniform Community law definition of the companies which may\nenjoy the right of establishment on the basis of a single connecting factor\ndetermining the national law applicable to a company\u2019,85 the Member States\nare free to determine when and under which conditions a company comes into\nexistence. Thus, \u2018a Member State has the power to define both the connecting\nfactor required of a company if it is to be regarded as incorporated under the\nlaw of that Member State [. . .] and that required if the company is to be able\nsubsequently to maintain that status.\u201986 The Court concludes that a Member\nState may prohibit a company to transfer its seat without dissolution to another\nMember State, \u2018thereby breaking the connecting factor required under the\nnational law of the Member State of incorporation.\u201987 On the other hand,\nthe Court points out that a transfer \u2018with an attendant change as regards\nthe national law applicable\u201988 falls within the scope of articles 49, 54 TFEU\n(ex-articles 43, 48 EC). Accordingly, measures of the Member State of\nincorporation that restrict this right need to be justified on grounds of an\noverriding requirement.89\n84 Cartesio (n 5) para 111. 85 ibid para 109 (emphasis added).\n86 ibid para 110 (emphasis added). 87 ibid para 110 (emphasis added).\n88 ibid para 111. 89 ibid para 113.\n316 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nIf the Court intended the words \u2018connecting factor\u201990 to mean the factor that\ndetermines the applicable company law (ie the connecting factor in private\ninternational law), as paragraph 109 of the judgment implies, and if it intended\nto use the words with the same meaning throughout the whole decision,\nit would manage to contradict itself within the span of three paragraphs\n(paras 109\u2013111). On the one hand, a transfer of seat which breaks the con-\nnecting factor and thus changes the applicable law must be permissible with-\nout dissolution,91 on the other hand, the consequences of breaking the\nconnecting factor fall within the power of the Member State.92 The only sen-\nsible interpretation is to attach two different meanings to the term \u2018connecting\nfactor\u2019. As the Court stresses in paragraph 109, before a company can avail\nitself of articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43, 48 EC), it has to be established\nwhether the company has been formed in accordance with the law of aMember\nState.93 This question, and the antecedent question of whose law shall govern\nthe formation of the company, can necessarily not be predetermined by EC\nlaw.94 Once the company has been validly formed, it may either transfer the\nreal seat or the registered seat in a way that causes a change in the applicable\nlaw. Any national restriction in this context will be subject to freedom of\nestablishment. Alternatively, the company may reorganize in a way that does\nnot relate to a connecting factor for the purpose of private international law. In\nthat case freedom of establishment does not apply. It follows from this dis-\ntinction that the \u2018connecting factor\u2019 mentioned in paragraph 110 of the judg-\nment95 must be one that does not determine the applicable law, whereas\nparagraph 111 of the judgment refers to the \u2018connecting factor\u2019 in the private\ninternational law sense. Consequently, the scenario referred to in paragraph\n110 of the judgment cannot be one of a company transferring its real seat out\nof a real seat theory State (our case 3). Rather, it must be one of a company\ntransferring its real seat out of an incorporation theory State (our case 1).\nThe Advocate General has added to the obscurity by holding that Hungary\nfollowed the real seat doctrine.96 This view is not in conformity with the\ninterpretation of the Law on Private International Law in Hungary and com-\nmon principles of conflict of laws. The provisions of the Company Act and the\nLaw on the Commercial Register that refer to the real seat restrict the scope of\napplication of Hungarian company law in cases that have a certain connecting\nfactor (the location of the real seat) with another country; they do not deter-\nmine the applicable law.97 Thus, this must be the distinction that the Court of\n90 In German: Anknu\u00a8pfung; French: rattachement; Dutch: aanknoping.

In conformity with this\ninterpretation, the Court in Cartesio does not discuss the real seat or incor-\nporation theory doctrines and, in fact, never refers to Hungary as a real seat\nState.98\nrelationships between its members shall be determined in accordance with its personal law.\n(2) The personal law of a legal person shall be the law of the State in the territory of which it is\nregistered.\u2019 Cf Cartesio (n 5) para 20. Para (2) of the article clearly states that the registered seat\nshall be the connecting factor. Thus, Hungarian private international company law is based on the\nincorporation theory. This connecting factor is then, for certain cases, qualified by virtue of the\ninterplay of art 1(1) of Law No CXLIV of 1997 on Commercial Companies (a gazdasa\u00b4gi\nta\u00b4rsasa\u00b4gokro\u00b4l szo\u00b4lo\u00b4 1997. e\u00b4vi CXLIV. to\u00a8rve\u00b4ny), which stipulates that the Company Act shall\ngovern only such companies \u2018which have their seat in Hungary\u2019 ibid para 11, and art 16(1) of Law\nNo CXLV of 1997 on the Commercial Register, Company Advertising and Legal Procedures in\nCommercial Registration Matters (a ce\u00b4gnyilva\u00b4ntarta\u00b4sro\u00b4l, a ce\u00b4gnyilva\u00b4nossa\u00b4gro\u00b4l e\u00b4s a b\u0131\u00b4ro\u00b4sa\u00b4gi\nce\u00b4gelja\u00b4ra\u00b4sro\u00b4l szo\u00b4lo\u00b4 1997. e\u00b4vi CXLV. to\u00a8rve\u00b4ny), which defines the seat of the company as \u2018the place\nwhere [the company\u2019s] central administration is situated\u2019 ibid para 17. The latter two provisions\nare not conflict of law rules. They circumscribe the scope of application of the Hungarian\nCompanies Act by requiring a Hungarian company to have its real seat in Hungary. It can in some\ncases be difficult to distinguish between a provision of a purely substantive nature that contains an\ninternational element, ie that applies if a certain element is satisfied abroad or within the territory\nof the lex causae, and provisions that contain a hidden conflict of laws rule, ie that determine their\ninternational scope of application notwithstanding the lex causae. The second type of rule has\nbeen described as a \u2018self-contained\u2019 (J Kropholler, Internationales Privatrecht (6th edn, Mohr\nSiebeck, Tu\u00a8bingen, 2006) \u00b7 13 IV 2) or \u2018self-satisfied\u2019 provision of substantive law (G Kegel,\n\u2018Die sebstgerechte Sachnorm\u2019 in E Jayme et al (eds), Geda\u00a8chtnisschrift fu\u00a8r Albert A Ehrenzweig\n(CF Mu\u00a8ller, Karlsruhe, 1976). The Hungarian provisions are not \u2018self-contained\u2019, they do not\ndecide about the application of Hungarian substantive company law notwithstanding the lex\ncausae. Conversely, they decide about the exclusion of that law in certain situations (when the\ncompany\u2019s real seat is not located within Hungary), which presupposes its applicability pursuant\nto different rules (art 18 of Decree-Law No 13 of 1979 on Private International Law Rules) in the\nfirst place.\n98 In the literature this correlation between the Court\u2019s definition of the material scope of arts\n49, 54 TFEU (ex-arts 43, 48 EC) and the relevance of the term \u2018connecting factor\u2019 for purposes of\nreal seat and incorporation theory often seems to be overlooked. For example, AF de Sousa,\n\u2018Company\u2019s Cross-border Transfer of Seat in the EU after Cartesio\u2019, Jean Monnet Working Paper\n07\/09, available at www.JeanMonnetProgram.org, 33, claims that \u2018Hungarian law apparently\nfollowed a strict version of the real seat theory.\u2019 However, had that been the case the applicable\nlaw would have changed and pursuant to paragraphs 111\u2013113 of the judgment the Hungarian\nrestrictions would have been within the scope of freedom of establishment. Moreover, on the basis\nof the bifurcation of the term \u2018connecting factor\u2019 suggested here the alleged \u2018squaring of the\ncircle\u2019 (at 47) by the Court presents itself as a consistent distinction between the situations in\nparagraphs 110 and 111 of the judgment (as long as the reaction of the receiving State is not taken\ninto account, see case 2 and case 4). In a similar vein, M Szyd\u0142o, \u2018Case C-210\/06, CARTESIO\nOktato\u00b4 e\u00b4s Szolga\u00b4ltato\u00b4 bt, Judgment of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of 16 December\n2008, not yet reported\u2019 (2009) 46 CMLRev 703, explains, on the one hand, that the Court in\nCartesio affirmed that a company\u2019s right to reincorporate in another Member State was within the\nscope of arts 49, 54 TFEU (ex-arts 43, 48 EC) (at 717), but alleges, on the other hand, that\npursuant to Cartesio companies are not protected if they lose their status as a company incor-\nporated under the law of a particular Member State because they are dissolved or a change of the\napplicable law takes place (at 713). A Johnston and P Syrpis, \u2018Regulatory competition in\nEuropean Company Law after Cartesio\u2019 (2009) 34 ELRev 390, argue that \u2018any attempt by a\ncompany incorporated in a real seat Member State to move its real seat out of the jurisdiction is\nlikely to result in the company being wound up\u2019, despite such a move resulting in an \u2018attendant\nchange\u2019 in the applicable law (Cartesio, n 5 para 111).\n318 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nComing back to our hypothetical, seeking a consistent interpretation of the\nholding of the Court of Justice and placing emphasis on the words \u2018an at-\ntendant change as regards the national law applicable\u201999 as the defining factor\nin deciding whether a scenario falls within the scope of articles 49, 54 TFEU\n(ex-articles 43, 48 EC) or not, will lead to the conclusion that the transfer of a\ncompany\u2019s real seat out of a real seat theory State should be treated anal-\nogously to the transfer of the registered seat out of an incorporation theory\nState (our case 2). Consequently, national legislation on the incorporation and\nwinding-up of companies does not enjoy immunity from the provisions on\nfreedom of establishment.100 We must therefore look at the reaction of\nMember State B. If B follows the real seat theory, it will apply its internal\ncompany law. The domestic law will require registration of the company in B\nin order for the company to be able to convert to a company form governed by\nB\u2019s law.101 B\u2019s company law may or may not require re-incorporation as a\n99 Cartesio (n 5) para 111. 100 ibid para 112.\n101 The Court in Cartesio uses the term \u2018conversion\u2019 somewhat ambiguously, see eg para-\ngraphs 111\u2013113 of the judgment. \u2018Conversion\u2019 may be understood narrowly as the change of a\ncompany into its functional equivalent in another legal system, for example of an English limited\ninto a German Gesellschaft mit beschra\u00a8nkter Haftung (GmbH), or broadly as any change of form\nof business association, for example of an English limited into a German partnership (Gesellschaft\nbu\u00a8rgerlichen Rechts pursuant to German Civil Code [BGB], \u00b7\u00b7 705\u2013740). The laws of some\nMember States understand conversion in the latter, broader sense, see eg Umwandlungsgesetz\n[Reorganisation of Companies Act], \u00b7 191(2). Such an interpretation of the Court\u2019s decision in\nCartesio could result in unintended liability. Assume, for example, that the directors of a limited\ncompany registered in A relocate from A to B and that both A and B apply the real seat theory.\nThe relocation may be interpreted as the transfer of the real seat from A to B (confer the facts of\nU\u00a8berseering, n 2). An unqualified application of Cartesio would lead to the following result: The\ntransfer of the real seat causes a change in the applicable law. Hence, possible impediments to the\ntransfer imposed by A are prohibited by the Treaty, provided that B allows the company to\nrelocate and change into a form of company under its own laws. This is the case and does not\nrequire any registration or other explicit legal act by the directors of the company if the partner-\nship law of B provides that a partnership comes into existence whenever two or more persons act\ntogether to promote the achievement of a common purpose (eg German Civil Code [BGB], \u00b7 705).\nDepending on the partnership law, the involuntary change of the limited company into a part-\nnership may entail joint (or joint and several) unlimited liability of all members (eg in the UK\npursuant to Partnership Act 1890, s 9, and in Germany pursuant to Commercial Code [HGB],\n\u00b7 128, see the decisions of the Federal Court of Justice in BGHZ 142, 315; 146, 341). Thus, rather\nthan protect the interests of the company\u2019s directors and members and facilitate free movement,\nCartesio would mandate the application of unfavourable partnership law. There are two ways to\navoid this result. First, note that the case described here constitutes a conflict between the holdings\nin Cartesio and U\u00a8berseering. According to Cartesio, since conversion of the company into\na partnership under the laws of B is permitted, A is not entitled to require liquidation ((n 5)\npara 111). However, a company in liquidation satisfies the requirements of U\u00a8berseering (n 2) para\n52: It is a company that has been \u2018validly incorporated in one Member State (\u2018A\u2019) in which it has\nits registered office\u2019, and it has, in this scenario, \u2018moved its actual centre of administration to\nMember State B\u2019. The rules governing a company in liquidation may be more advantageous for\nthe members of the company than partnership law. Consequently, U\u00a8berseering demands that\nMember State B recognises the company as a company in liquidation governed by the laws\nof A and that it does not apply its own partnership law. The first solution to the quandary is,\ntherefore, to accord precedence to U\u00a8berseering and disapply Cartesio. Second, the unintended\nconsequences can be avoided by interpreting the term \u2018conversion\u2019 more restrictively and require\nan intentional decision of the company for conversion in order for the effects of Cartesio to apply\nMysteries of Freedom of Establishment After Cartesio 319\nprecondition for registration. If it does require re-incorporation, such a rule\nwould be absolved from compliance with EU freedom of establishment prin-\nciples pursuant to the concepts established in Cartesio and U\u00a8berseering.102\nIf B applies the incorporation theory, it will refer to A\u2019s law (since the\nregistered seat of the company has remained in A). A renvoi (triggered by the\ntransfer of the real seat to B) will lead to the outcome described in the pre-\nceding paragraph. Finally, let us assume that B\u2019s private international law\nrefers to the internal (substantive) rules of A to the exclusion of its choice of\nlaw rules, or that Member State A is the forum and A\u2019s private international\nlaw accepts B\u2019s renvoi.103 A\u2019s substantive company law will most likely re-\nquire liquidation if the connecting factor (the real seat) is transferred out of its\nterritory. However, Cartesio prohibits such a restriction in the light of freedom\nof establishment (save a possible justification) if (1) the transfer leads to a\nchange in the applicable national law and (2) the transfer of the company\nwithout dissolution is permitted under the law of the receiving Member State.\nThe law of the receiving State (B) comprises its substantive and private in-\nternational law. Thus, it demands the application of A\u2019s substantive company\nlaw, which, in turn, requires dissolution. Again, we arrive at circular and\nnonsensical results on the basis of the concept of free movement of companies\nas developed by the European Court of Justice.\nCase 4: A company transfers its registered seat out of a real seat theory\nState. This case has also not been decided in Cartesio. However, it is anal-\nogous to the scenario of a transfer of the real seat out of an incorporation\ntheory State (our case 1), which are the facts of Cartesio. Thus, as our cases 2\nand 3 demand parallel treatment, so do cases 1 and 4. It follows that the\nMember State of incorporation (A) can require winding-up and liquidation\nbecause the location of the registered seat in the territory of A is one of the\n\u2018connecting factors\u2019 that, according to the Court of Justice, the Member State\nhas the power to define and that companies have to adhere to if they wish to\navail themselves of freedom of establishment.104 B, on the other hand, will\nregister the company without re-incorporation if it allows for conversion into a\n(see A Wis\u00b4niewski and A Opalski, \u2018Companies\u2019 Freedom of Establishment after the ECJ Cartesio\nJudgment\u2019 (2009) 10 EBOR 595, 615\u2013616). This is preferable since it allows the parties to choose\nwhat is more appropriate in the individual case. At the same time, there is no reason to permit\nconversion (and hence the consequences of Cartesio) only if the host Member States provides for\na functional equivalent of the home Member State company form (as A Wis\u00b4niewski and\nA Opalski advocate, ibid 616\u2013617), as long as conversion into a non-equivalent form is consonant\nwith the wishes of the parties concerned (see also D Zimmer and C Naendrup, \u2018Das Cartesio-\nUrteil des EuGH: Ru\u00a8ck- oder Fortschritt fu\u00a8r das internationale Gesellschaftsrecht?\u2019 (2009) Neue\nJuristische Wochenschrift 545, 548).\n102 cf case 2.\n103 For example Einfu\u00a8hrungsgesetz zum Bu\u00a8rgerlichen Gesetzbuch (EGBGB) [Introductory\nLaw to the Civil Code] art 4(1).\n104 Cartesio (n 5) para 110. Most real seat states will demand dissolution if the registered seat\nis transferred to another country even though the applicable law does not change: cf B Gro\u00dffeld,\n\u2018Internationales Gesellschaftsrecht\u2019 [Private International Company Law] in J Kropholler et al\n320 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\ndomestic company and if the company has not been dissolved pursuant to A\u2019s\nlaw, which is, according to B\u2019s private international law, the applicable law on\nthis matter (notwithstanding whether B is an incorporation theory or a real seat\ntheory State). If A does not require dissolution, it could be argued that ac-\ncording to the rationale of Centros and Inspire Art B likewise is not permitted\nto require re-incorporation or re-location of the real seat to B.105\nCase 5: The transfer of both the real seat and the registered seat out of a\nMember State that applies the incorporation theory constitutes a combination\nof our cases 1 and 2. Since the connecting factor between the company and the\nMember State of incorporation that enables the company to rely on the right of\nestablishment (ie not\u2014at least not only\u2014the connecting factor within the\nmeaning of private international law) is eliminated it might be assumed that\nthe Member State of incorporation was entitled to require the company to\ndissolve.\nCase 6: The transfer of both the real seat and the registered seat out of a\nMember State that applies the real seat theory (combination of cases 3 and 4)\nis treated similarly. Again, the existence of the company as a creature of the\nMember State of incorporation (and, therefore, the precondition for an appli-\ncation of articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43, 48 EC)) hinges on the preser-\nvation of the connecting factor with the Member State of incorporation. The\nconnecting factor (for example the real seat in the territory of the Member\nState of incorporation) is discontinued; therefore, the holding in Cartesio can\nbe interpreted as empowering the Member State to require dissolution.\nHowever, the treatment of cases 5 and 6 as not falling within the scope of\narticles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43, 48 EC) is not compelling. The connect-\ning factor in case 1 (Cartesio) is the real seat, while the change of applicable\nlaw is brought about by a transfer of the registered office (case 2; also decided\nin Cartesio as being protected by the right of establishment). Nonetheless, the\nconnecting factor that has to be satisfied for a company to be entitled to\nincorporate under the law of a given Member State (be it an incorporation\ntheory or a real seat theory State) is as much the location of the real seat106 as\nthe registered seat. The company law of no country will allow incorporation as\na type of company governed by that country\u2019s law without registration in the\ncountry, and hence registered seat located in the territory of the country. Why,\nthen, should the elimination of the first connecting factor (transfer of the real\nseat as in case 1) allow the Member State of incorporation to impose restric-\ntive measures, but not the elimination of the second connecting factor (transfer\nof the registered seat, as in case 2)? If both registered seat and real seat are\n(eds), J von Staudingers Kommentar zum Bu\u00a8rgerlichen Gesetzbuch (13th edn, de Gruyter, Berlin,\n1993) para 599\u2013604.\n105 cf (n 83).\n106 Provided that the substantive company law of the Member State of incorporation is struc-\ntured as Hungary\u2019s law in Cartesio.\nMysteries of Freedom of Establishment After Cartesio 321\ntransferred, as in cases 5 and 6, the applicable law changes, which, according\nto Cartesio, triggers the application of articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43,\n48 EC). This is one of the many inconsistencies of the decision of the Court of\nJustice.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis case-by-case analysis makes clear that the outcome of a free movement\ncase under the right of establishment of companies as interpreted by the\nEuropean Court of Justice depends in an arbitrary manner on the type of\nprivate international company law doctrine (real seat or incorporation theory)\nin force in the Member State of incorporation and the receiving Member State.\nWhy, for example, should a company that transfers the registered seat out of\nan incorporation theory State (case 2) be entitled to invoke the protection of\narticles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43, 48 EC) whereas the Member State of\nincorporation may require the company to dissolve without having to fear\na violation of the right of establishment if it follows the real seat theory\n(case 4)? The same argument can be made with respect to the differential\ntreatment of our cases 1 (dissolution) and 3 (no dissolution). A justification for\nthis discrimination is absent. It can probably be explained in light of the\ntrajectories initiated by Daily Mail on the one hand and Centros on the other\nhand, and by the reluctance of the Court of Justice to comprehensively reform\nthe principles established in these two cases. Ever since Daily Mail, the Court\nhas adhered to the dichotomy of moving-in and moving-out scenarios and the\ndifferences in the scope of application of articles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43,\n48 EC) implied by the direction of movement. In Cartesio, and earlier in\nLasteyrie du Sallaint and Marks & Spencer, the Court of Justice has retreated\nsomewhat from a strict dichotomy. In Cartesio, the relaxation appears in the\nform of the right of a company to leave the Member State of incorporation if\nthe transfer of seat triggers a change in the applicable company law. However,\nthe ECJ has not yet been willing to let go of Daily Mail completely.\nA rationalized rule governing the right of establishment should not be gui-\nded by obsolete differentiations but by the question whether free movement of\ncompanies should be facilitated. This is not a dogmatic but an empirical\nquestion. The capacity of incorporators to choose freely between a large\nnumber of company law regimes and types of company and to change the\nconnecting factor without dissolution after the company has come into exist-\nence enables them to opt for the form and regulatory environment that best\nsuits their needs. Consequently, it reduces transaction costs for the firm. On\nthe other hand, the presence in the territory of a Member State of various types\nof company, many of them foreign and some governed by legal regimes that\nthe domestic adjudicator is not familiar with, increases the costs of infor-\nmation and of legal advice for customers and other market participants and the\nrisk of an incorrect judgment in case litigation cannot be avoided. Thus,\n322 International and Comparative Law Quarterly\nunrestricted free movement has a negative impact on transaction costs for\nthird parties. A comprehensive empirical assessment of these impacts should\ndetermine whether\u2014and to which extent\u2014free movement of companies is\ndesirable. Depending on the outcome of such an assessment, Member States\nshould be allowed to restrict the transfer of companies into or out of\ntheir territory or be obliged to justify their restrictive measures in light of\narticles 49, 54 TFEU (ex-articles 43, 48 EC), notwithstanding whether they\nfollow the real seat theory or the incorporation theory, whether the company\nhas transferred the centre of administration or the registered seat, or whether a\nmoving-in or a moving-out scenario is at issue. It is appreciated that an em-\npirical analysis as envisaged here is complex, difficult to implement, and may\nnot generate conclusive results.107 Even so, a clarification of the convoluted\nlegal principles is imperative in order to restore legal certainty.\n107 cf the ambiguous results that empirical surveys in the US have produced, for example\nL Bebchuk et al, \u2018Does the Evidence Favor State Competition in Corporate Law?\u2019 (2002) 90 Cal\nRev 1775, with references.\nMysteries of Freedom of Establishment After Cartesio 323\n"}
