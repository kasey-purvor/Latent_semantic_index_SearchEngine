Introduction\nCombining membrane technology with biological\ntreatment, the membrane bioreactor (MBR) is an\nalternative to conventional wastewater treatment\nmethods (Stephenson et al. 2000). Wastewater, as\nin the activated sludge process, is treated by bio-\nmass in an aerated mixed tank before being fil-\ntered. The sedimentation stage of the\nconventional activated sludge process is replaced\nby a membrane filtration stage. An almost solids-\nfree permeate passes through the membranes,\nwhereas micro-organisms are retained in the\ntank. Thus the mixed liquor can be concentrated,\nresulting in a small bioreactor footprint and an\nexcellent quality treated water. However, operat-\ning with membranes at high solids concentration\npresents some disadvantages. The major process\nproblem with MBRs remains membrane fouling\ndue to the interaction between the membrane\nmaterial and the components in the activated\nsludge liquor (Chang & Fane 2001). The MBR\nmain power requirement comes from aeration,\nwhich is used for supply of dissolved oxygen\n(DO) for metabolism and to maintain solids in\nsuspension. The biological aeration requirements\nare higher than in conventional activated sludge\nprocess due to the higher oxygen demand initi-\nated by highly concentrated biomass. Addition-\nally, aeration is used for membrane cleaning\nReviews in Environmental Science and Bio\/Technology (2005) 4:223\u2013233 \u0001 Springer 2005\nDOI 10.1007\/s11157-005-2097-3\npurposes in submerged MBRs, where membrane\ncleaning is provided by air scouring and by fibres\nagitation in the case of hollow fibres membranes.\nAs biomass and aeration characteristics have\nan effect on each other, two topics should be\nconsidered when studying aeration operations in\nMBRs:\n\u2022 the effects of biomass components on aeration\nefficiency, represented by the oxygen transfer\nparameters,\n\u2022 the effects of aeration (intensity and type of\ndiffusers) on biomass characteristics.\nAs in all aerobic biological systems, biomass\ncontained in the MBR requires oxygen to per-\nform diverse chemical reactions. The right\namount of oxygen needs to be provided to the\nmicro-organisms and wastewater, in response to\ntheir three specific demands:\n\u2022 carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand\n(BOD): conversion of the carbonaceous organic\nmatter in wastewater to cell tissue and various\ngaseous end products,\n\u2022 nitrogenous BOD: ammoniacal nitrogen is oxi-\ndised to the intermediate product nitrite, which\nis then converted to nitrate; this process is\nnitrification,\n\u2022 inorganic chemical oxygen demand (COD):\noxidation of reduced inorganic compounds\nwithin the wastewater.\nThe amount of oxygen diffusing in the mixed\nliquor is characterised by the oxygen mass trans-\nfer coefficient. This mass transfer coefficient is\none of the general parameters used to describe\nthe diffusion of particles from regions of high\nconcentration into regions of lower concentra-\ntion. This approach assumes that the diffusion\noccurs across an interface. The basic model for\nmass transfer is:\n\u00f0rate of mass transferred\u00de\n\u00bc k\u00f0interfacial area\u00de\u00f0concentration difference\u00de;\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere k is the mass transfer coefficient (Cussler\n1997).\nThe main parameter used to characterise the\noxygen transfer in aeration processes is the over-\nall mass transfer coefficient, kLa; where kL repre-\nsents the mass transfer coefficient based on the\nliquid film resistance and a, the interfacial area.\nAnother parameter commonly used to describe\nthe oxygen transfer in biological aerated systems\nis the a-factor. This correction factor is defined\nas the ratio between kLa in the process solution\nand kLa in clean water. It accounts for the effect\nof process water characteristics on the oxygen\ntransfer coefficient.\nIn MBRs, like in all aerobic wastewater pro-\ncesses, both by the biomass characteristics and\nthe design of the aeration system are affecting\nthe oxygen transfer (Mueller et al. 2002). Bio-\nmass is a heterogeneous mixture of particles, mi-\ncro-organisms, colloids, organic polymers and\ncations, which all have different shapes, sizes and\ndensities. All these parameters have an impact on\noxygen transfer. Mass transfer is also linked with\ncontact area size between gas and liquid phases,\ni.e. bubble shape and solids concentration (Gar-\ncia-Ochoa et al. 2000). Bubble characteristics dif-\nfer depending on the kind of aerator used and\nthe bubble coalescence effect created by the bio-\nmass characteristics. The aeration in MBRs is\ngenerally provided by fine bubble aerators, used\nto keep the content of the aerobic tank well\nmixed and provide oxygen to the biomass. In\naddition, in submerged MBRs, coarse bubble\naerators situated under the membrane modules\nare used to scour and\/or gently agitate the mem-\nbranes in order to control membrane fouling\n(Stephenson et al. 2000).\nOn the other hand, MBR properties are af-\nfected by aeration. Changes in airflow rate affect\nthe biological and physical characteristics of the\nmixed liquor. Species diversities differ depending\nof the amount of oxygen available in the solution\n(Madoni et al. 1993). Mixing intensity, resulting\nfrom aeration, affects the shape and size of parti-\ncles by breaking-up sludge flocs (Abbassi et al.\n1999).\nMany correlations linking oxygen transfer and\naerobic biological system characteristics are found\nin the literature, simple or complex, depending on\nthe parameters considered (Fujie et al. 1992; Van\nWeert et al. 1995; Boumansour & Vasel 1998; Ab-\nbassi et al. 1999; Chang et al. 1999; Chang &\nFane 2000; Garc\u0131\u00b4a-Ochoa et al. 2000; Hebrard et\nal. 2000; Badino et al. 2001, 2001; Chern et al.\n2001; Lu et al. 2001; Ozbek & Gayik 2001; Ozaki\n& Yamamoto 2001; Chisti & Jauregui-Haza 2002;\nGarrido Hoyos et al. 2002). However, these corre-\nlations are difficult to apply to other systems than\nthe one they are characterising.\n224\nThis review looks at the MBR parameters\nindependently and collectively, providing a better\nunderstanding of the oxygen transfer occurring\nin MBRs and the effects of aeration on MBR\nbiomass. The review was extended to similar aer-\nobic biological systems such as fermentation,\nmineral industry and slurry, to provide insights\ninto MBR operation.\n2. Particle concentration\nThe impact of solids concentration on the oxy-\ngen transfer has been studied by many authors\nfor a wide range of systems and different kinds\nof particles (Table 1). Despite the differences be-\ntween the systems and the solids characteristics\nused, high solids concentrations affected the oxy-\ngen transfer in the same way, i.e. reducing oxy-\ngen transfer. Nevertheless, the drop observed in\nthe oxygen transfer while increasing the solids\nconcentration is more or less important depend-\ning on the characteristics of the system.\nThe decrease or increase of the oxygen trans-\nfer coefficient is not linear with changes in the\nsolids concentration. The results obtained in an\nagitated bioreactor for the mineral industry dem-\nonstrated that, while increasing the concentration\nof sand particles from 0 to 40 vol.% solids, the\ndecline in oxygen transfer efficiency was not of\nthe same importance for the different concentra-\ntion ranges. Between 0 and 10 vol.% solids and\nbetween 30 and 40 vol.% solids, the decrease of\noxygen transfer was more significant than be-\ntween 10 and 30 vol.% solids (Van Weert et al.\n1995). Data from a fermentation bioreactor with\na cell concentration range of 0\u20135 g l)1 showed\nthe same trend. The total decrease of kLa\nreached 30% over the concentration range, with\na 15% decrease between 0 and 1 g l)1 (Ju & Sun-\ndararajan 1994). The accumulated cells near the\ninterface may have formed a layer that dimin-\nished the oxygen transfer. This phenomenon was\ndefined as the physical blocking effect (Bungay &\nMasak 1981; Ju & Sundararajan 1994).\nFreitas & Teixeira (2001), Verlaan & Tramper\n(1987) and Ozbek & Gayik (2001) established\nthat an increase in particle concentration did not\naffect the two parameters of the overall mass\ntransfer coefficient, kL and a, with the same sig-\nnificance. The augmentation of the solids concen-\ntration increased the coalescence process, which\nreduced the interfacial area a. Nevertheless, the\nsolids loading seemed to have only a minor effect\non the mass transfer coefficient kL. In an inter-\nnal-loop airlift reactor, the kLa diminution corre-\nsponding to the increase of solids concentration\nwas stronger for riser gas velocities higher than\n0.075 m s)1. Up to this value the effect of solids\nloading on the mass transfer coefficient was neg-\nligible. The amount of gas in the system was so\nlow that the coalescence process was not affected\nsignificantly by the presence of the solids (Freitas\n& Teixeira 2001).\nA small increase in the solids loading can,\nhowever, initially lead to a better mass transfer\ncoefficient. In an airlift bioreactor for fermenta-\ntion, the increase of mycelial pellets concentra-\ntion had a positive effect on kLa up to a certain\nlevel (6.68 g l)1), then the oxygen transfer effi-\nciency decreased with further addition of solids\n(Klein et al. 2002). Smith & Skidmore (1990) and\nSaba et al. (1987) noticed a stabilisation of kLa\nbefore the decrease. Diverse explanations for this\nphenomenon have been given in the literature.\nSmith & Skidmore (1990), working with very\nsmall particles, explained it by both the disrupt-\ning and the blocking effects of fine particles on\nthe liquid surrounding air bubbles. Klein et al.\n(2002), working with bigger particles (Table 1),\nbased their interpretation of the kLa decline on\nthe interaction of pellets with bubbles, promoting\nmore intensive bubble coalescence and break-up\nevents in the bioreactor. Both the size and the\nfrequency of coalesced bubbles slightly increased\nwith increasing biomass. The rate of mass trans-\nfer is proportional to the contact area between\nthe liquid and the oxygen phases, therefore small\nbubbles have a higher contact area\/volume ratio\ncompare to coarse bubbles at equal airflow rates,\nmaking them more efficient in terms of kLa.\nMixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) con-\ncentrations for MBRs are typically between 10\nand 20 g l)1. The range starts from 2 to 80 g l)1\n(Stephenson et al. 2000). The biomass concentra-\ntion range is so wide that all the phenomena de-\nscribed can be expected to happen in MBRs.\nHowever, several studies observed an exponential\nrelationship between a-factor and MLSS concen-\ntration. Muller et al. (1995), found a-factor values\nof 0.98, 0.5, 0.3 and 0.2 for MLSS concentra-\ntions of 3, 16, 26 and 39 g l)1 respectively.

equation representing the impact of\nthe solids concentrations on the a-factor could be\ncalculated from this data, with an R2 of 0.99\n(Figure 1). Gu\u00a8nder (2001) and Krampe & Krauth\n(2003) observed the same trend but with lower a-\nfactor values (Figure 1). Oxygen transfer in\nMBRs decreased exponentially with increasing\nsolids concentration. However, the solids concen-\ntration can easily be controlled by applying con-\nstant solids retention time (SRT) and hydraulic\nretention time (HRT) to attain a targeted solids\nconcentration or by irregularly wasting sludge\nwith the aim to keep the solids concentration\naround a targeted value (Stephenson et al. 2000).\nBy operating at lower solids concentrations (be-\nlow 15 g l)1), the oxygen transfer could be signifi-\ncantly improved (Figure 1).\n3. Particle size\nAeration, mass transfer and particle size all inter-\nact with each other. Airflow variations have a\ndual effect on biological systems: on oxygen con-\ncentration available in the solution and on mix-\ning intensity. Both of these effects influence the\nsize of the particles. No clear relationship cha-\nracterising the DO concentration effect on acti-\nvated sludge flocs size has been found. However,\nlarger flocs have been observed at higher DO\nconcentrations (Wilen & Balmer 1999).\nAn increase in airflow, to produce a higher\noxygen concentration, results in a greater mixing\nintensity. The shear stress applied on the acti-\nvated sludge flocs is affected, inducing floc break-\nup, and so particles of different sizes are formed.\nTherefore the difference noticed in floc size when\nincreasing the airflow does not only come from\nthe amount of oxygen in the solution, but also\nfrom the rise in mixing intensity (Abbassi et al.\n1999). Laboratory scale experiments, looking at\nthe reduction of excess sludge production in\nwastewater treatment technology, have been\nundertaken to characterise the effects due to the\noxygen concentration, independently of the mix-\ning intensity, on activated sludge flocs. At a\nsludge loading of 0.53 kg BOD5 kg MLSS\n)1 d)1,\nthe excess sludge production was reduced by\n22% by raising the oxygen concentration from 2\nto 6 mg l)1 (Abbassi et al. 1999). 10% of the\nbreak-up events were a result of the mixing\nintensity, while 12% were a result of an increase\nin the mixed liquor oxygen concentration. Higher\nmixing intensity and DO concentration, created\nby raising the airflow, had almost the same im-\npact on the floc break-up, and therefore on the\nparticle size.\nThe modification observed in the mass trans-\nfer coefficient while increasing the solids loading\nis dependent on the particle size. With fine parti-\ncles, up to 0.01 mm, kLa increased with increas-\ning solids concentration up to a certain level and\nremained stable before decreasing with further\nsolids loading (Saba et al. 1987; Smith & Skid-\nmore 1990).

In systems containing packing materials or\nbiomass support, the oxygen coefficient increased\nwith larger particles (Fujie et al. 1992; Ozbek &\nGayik 2001). The smallest materials brought\nabout bubble coalescence, while smaller bubbles\nwere obtained with very large packing materials.\nTurbulence produced might be more violent with\nbigger particles. Nevertheless, Koide et al. (1992)\nnoticed no modification in kLa while increasing\nthe diameter from 1.88 to 3.98 mm of gel parti-\ncles in a bubble column.\nParticle size differs, from one MBR to an-\nother, because of the type of MBR and the char-\nacteristics of aeration, biomass and wastewater\n(Table 2). In a sidestream system, activated\nsludge is recirculated by means of a pump (Ste-\nphenson et al. 2000). In the membrane unit,\ncross-flow rate is kept high, to avoid a cake layer\nto build-up on the membrane surface. High pres-\nsure allows a constant permeate flux to be main-\ntained through the membrane. These processes\napply a high shear stress on the flocs and break\nthem up, reducing the particle size. In a sub-\nmerged MBR, the cross-flow velocity is obtained\nby aeration and the suction pressure is lower.\nThe forces applied on flocs are weaker, allowing\nbigger particles to be contained in the bioreactor.\nWisniewski & Grasmick (1998) studied the effects\nof the recirculation on the particle size in a side-\nstream MBR. Without recirculation, flocs size\nranged from 20 lm to more than 500 lm. Only\n15% of the particles were lower than 100 lm.\nWith recirculation, reduction in particle size was\ndirectly proportional to the magnitude of the\nshear stress and the experiment time. At linear\nvelocities in the membrane module of 0.5 and\n5 m s)1, 55 and 98% of the particles were lower\nthan 100 lm respectively. Activated sludge flocs\nwere destroyed by the recirculating pump. In a\nsidestream MBR operated at a SRT >3500 d,\nthe mixed liquor consisted of a dense suspension\nof free cells, very small flocs (<50 lm) and floc\nfragments (Muller et al. 1995). Lee et al. (2003),\nobserved floc sizes ranging from 1 to 280 lm in a\nsubmerged MBR with volatile suspended solids\n(VSS) concentrations comprised between 2.8 and\n5.5 g l1. The mean particle size varies signifi-\ncantly from one MBR to another but also inside\nan MBR where large particle size distributions\nare found and particle sizes can range from a\nfew lm to 500 lm.\n4. Viscosity effect\nAn increase in viscosity has been shown to have\na negative influence on the oxygen transfer coeffi-\ncient (Koide et al. 1992; Garc\u0131\u00b4a-Ochoa et al.\n2000; Badino et al. 2001; Jin et al. 2001; Ozbek\n& Gayik 2001), the systems and the viscosity\nranges studied are shown in Table 3.

Bubble coalescence is\ninfluenced by viscosity, resulting in modifications\nin bubble size distribution. Experiments con-\nducted with addition of glycerol to increase the\nviscosity demonstrated that at high viscosity,\nlarge bubbles were formed (Ozbek & Gayik\n2001). Air became less well distributed through-\nout the process fluid and kLa decreased. In the\ncase of mycelial biomass production, large spher-\nical-capped bubbles rose rapidly, while smaller\nbubbles remained trapped inside the reactor (Jin\net al. 2001). Oxygen solubility was lowered by\nthe highly viscous solution. Resistance to oxygen\ntransfer, from the gaseous to the liquid phase,\nwas increased (Badino et al. 2001).\nTypical viscosity values for MBRs are pre-\nsented in Table 4. Krampe & Krauth (2003) and\nGu\u00a8nder (2001) formulated equations linking the\na-factor to the representative viscosity at a shear\nrate of 40 s)1 in high MLSS concentration acti-\nvated sludge (Table 5). The negative relationship\nwas clearer at high viscosity (Krampe & Krauth\n2003). The a-factor was better correlated to the\nviscosity than to the MLSS concentration (Wag-\nner et al. 2002). Activated sludge has been char-\nacterised as a non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluid.\nIncreasing the shear stress led to a decrease in\nviscosity (Dick & Ewing 1967; Stephenson et al.\n2000; Wagner et al. 2002). An increase in aera-\ntion rate has a double beneficial effect on the\noxygen transfer: it increases the amount of oxy-\ngen available in the MBR and decreases the bio-\nmass viscosity by increasing the shear stress.\nViscosity is also correlated to the solids concen-\ntration: viscosity increased exponentially with\nincreasing MLSS concentration (Sato & Ishii\n1991; Manem & Sanderson 1996), negatively\naffecting the oxygen transfer.\n5. Discussion\nAeration plays an important role in MBR opera-\ntions and represents its major power input (Ste-\nphenson et al. 2000). To allow MBRs to be\ncompetitive to conventional wastewater treat-\nment plants, these additional costs need to be re-\nduced. Particle concentration, particle size and\nviscosity are the main parameters characterising\nthe biomass and known to have an effect on the T\na\nb\nle\n3\n.\nS\ny\nst\nem\ns\nst\nu\nd\nie\nd\nfo\nr\nv\nis\nco\nsi\nty\neff\nec\nts\no\nn\no\nx\ny\ng\nen\nm\na\nss\ntr\na\nn\nsf\ner\nA\np\np\nli\nca\nti\no\nn\na\nre\na\nS\ny\nst\nem\nP\na\nrt\nic\nle\ns\nF\nlu\nid\nb\neh\na\nv\nio\nu\nr\nV\nis\nco\nsi\nty\n(P\na\ns)\nk\nL\na\n(m\nin\n)\n1\n)\nR\nef\ner\nen\nce\nF\ner\nm\nen\nta\nti\no\nn\nE\nx\nte\nrn\na\nl\na\nir\nli\nft\nb\nio\nre\na\nct\no\nr\nM\ny\nce\nli\na\nl\ncu\nlt\nu\nre\nb\nro\nth\ns\n(R\nh\niz\no\np\nu\ns\no\nli\ng\no\nsp\no\nru\ns)\nn\no\nn\n-N\new\nto\nn\nia\nn\np\nse\nu\nd\no\np\nla\nst\nic\n6\n3\n4\n0\nn\nd\nJi\nn\net\na\nl.\n(2\n0\n0\n1\n)\n1\n2\n,4\n0\n0\n1\n8\n,6\n0\n0\nF\ner\nm\nen\nta\nti\no\nn\nB\nio\nre\na\nct\no\nr\nF\ner\nm\nen\nte\nd\nb\nro\nth\n(A\nsp\ner\ng\nil\nlu\ns\na\nw\na\nm\no\nri\n)\nn\no\nn\n-N\new\nto\nn\nia\nn\np\nse\nu\nd\no\np\nla\nst\nic\n0\n.0\n1\n3\n\u2013\n0\n.2\n5\n7\n6\n.3\n5\n\u2013\n2\n.0\n7\nB\na\nd\nin\no\net\na\nl.\n(2\n0\n0\n1\n)\nF\ner\nm\nen\nta\nti\no\nn\nB\nio\nre\na\nct\no\nr\nB\nio\nm\na\nss\n(X\na\nn\nth\no\nm\no\nn\na\ns\nca\nm\np\nes\ntr\nis\n)\nn\no\nn\n-N\new\nto\nn\nia\nn\np\nse\nu\nd\no\np\nla\nst\nic\n0\n.0\n0\n1\n\u2013\n0\n.1\n6\n8\nn\nd\nG\na\nrc\n\u0131\u00b4a\n-O\nch\no\na\net\na\nl.\n(2\n0\n0\n0\n)\nA\ner\no\nb\nic\nb\nio\nlo\ng\nic\na\nl\nsy\nst\nem\nB\nio\nre\na\nct\no\nr\nG\nly\nce\nro\nl\nn\nd\n0\n.0\n0\n1\n\u2013\n0\n.5\n6\n6\n2\n.6\n5\n\u2013\n0\n.0\n8\n3\nO\nzb\nek\n&\nG\na\ny\nik\n(2\n0\n0\n1\n)\nW\na\nst\new\na\nte\nr\ntr\nea\ntm\nen\nt\nA\ner\na\nte\nd\nco\nn\nta\nin\ner\nA\nct\niv\na\nte\nd\nsl\nu\nd\ng\ne\nn\no\nn\n-N\new\nto\nn\nia\nn\np\nse\nu\nd\no\np\nla\nst\nic\n0\n.0\n0\n5\n\u2013\n0\n.1\n0\n5\nn\nd\nK\nra\nm\np\ne\n&\nK\nra\nu\nth\n(2\n0\n0\n3\n)\nS\nlu\nrr\ny\nB\nu\nb\nb\nle\nco\nlu\nm\nn\nG\nel\np\na\nrt\nic\nle\ns\nn\nd\n0\n.0\n0\n1\n\u2013\n0\n.0\n1\n3\nn\nd\nK\no\nid\ne\net\na\nl.\n(1\n9\n9\n2\n)\nM\nin\ner\na\nl\nin\nd\nu\nst\nry\nA\ng\nit\na\nte\nd\nta\nn\nk\nS\na\nn\nd\nn\nd\n0\n.0\n0\n1\n\u2013\n0\n.0\n6\n2\nn\nd\nV\na\nn\nW\nee\nrt\net\na\nl.\n(1\n9\n9\n5\n)\nF\ner\nm\nen\nta\nti\no\nn\nA\nir\nli\nft\nb\nio\nre\na\nct\no\nr\nF\ner\nm\nen\nta\nti\no\nn\nb\nro\nth\ns\n(A\nsp\ner\ng\nil\nlu\ns\nn\nig\ner\n)\nN\new\nto\nn\nia\nn\n0\n.0\n0\n1\nn\nd\nK\nle\nin\net\na\nl.\n(2\n0\n0\n2\n)\n229\noxygen transfer. These three biomass parameters\nand aeration are interrelated (Figure 2). The aer-\nation intensity affects the particle size and the\nviscosity, while solids concentration modifies the\nviscosity. Their individual effect on oxygen trans-\nfer can be modified by the added effect of an-\nother parameter, especially for particle size and\nconcentration.\nIn most cases, the changes in kLa are related\nto modifications of the air bubbles. Fine bubbles\naerators are commonly used in MBRs, yet coarse\nbubble aeration is seen in submerged MBRs to\nreduce membrane fouling (Cornel et al. 2003).\nFine bubble aeration remains the most efficient\nsystem, small bubbles having a higher contact\narea\/volume ratio increasing the term a of the\noxygen transfer coefficient kLa. However, in\nMBRs the bubble size is often altered by coales-\ncence and break-up events initiated by the bio-\nmass characteristics. Bubble coalescence may\noccur when operating at high solids concentra-\ntion, in presence of small particles or at high vis-\ncosity. Therefore fine bubble aeration becomes\nless efficient and the kLa values move towards\ncoarse bubble aeration values. In contrast, smal-\nler bubbles can be formed in presence of large\nparticles, improving the oxygen transfer. How-\never, in highly viscous biomass, small bubbles\ncan stay trapped inside the MBR, leading to a\npoor distribution of the air (Jin et al. 2001).\nEven if the mean particle size varies depend-\ning on the system design (in particular due to\naeration and recirculation) and biomass charac-\nteristics, the actual range of particle size remains\nvery wide from a few lm to more than 500 lm,\nespecially for submerged MBRs. To improve the\noxygen transfer efficiency, large particles will\nneed to be formed. However, aeration in MBRs\nneeds to sustain the oxygen demand from a high\nconcentrated biomass, implying high aeration\nrate and so, high mixing intensity. Low mixing\nintensity, allowing large flocs to form, is diffi-\ncultly to achieve in MBRs.\nBubble coalescence increased while operating\nat high solids concentration or high viscosity,\nreducing the oxygen transfer. These two parame-\nters should be kept reasonably low. Particle con-\ncentration is the easiest parameter to control in\nMBRs. By operating at fixed SRT and HRTs,\nthe solids concentration can be stabilised (Ste-\nphenson et al. 2000). Viscosity in MBRs is\nstrongly correlated to the solids concentration;\nhigher solids concentration leads to an exponen-\ntial increase in viscosities (Sato & Ishii 1991;\nManem & Sanderson 1996). Controlling the\nMBR solids concentration is a straightforward\nway of regulating the viscosity. However, high\naeration rates, in addition to increasing the\namount of oxygen, intensify the shear stress in-\nside the MBR, leading to lower values for viscos-\nity.\nThe biomass parameters affect the overall vol-\numetric gas\u2013liquid mass transfer coefficient, kLa,\nin different ways. The solids concentration affects\nthe interfacial area, a, more than the gas\u2013liquid\nmass transfer coefficient kL. In contrast, the vis-\ncosity affects kL more, the resistance applied to\nthe oxygen transfer from the gas to the liquid\nphase being increased. The effects of particle size\nand solids concentration on oxygen transfer are\ninterrelated. When increasing the solids concen-\ntration with fine particles (up to 0.01 mm), kLa\nincreased up to a certain level and remained sta-\nble before decreasing with further solids loading.\nWith large particles (around 1\u20133 mm), it led di-\nrectly to a decrease in kLa. The second phenome-\nnon is more likely to happen in MBRs, where\nthe mean particle size is generally above\nTable 4.

The amount of oxygen available in\nthe solution and the shear stress applied to the\nflocs are linked together by one parameter: the\naeration intensity. These two phenomena have\nalmost the same impact on the particle size,\nwhen increased, break-up events happen, forming\nsmaller particles. The shear stress also affects the\nbiomass viscosity. High shear stress leads to low\nviscosity values.\nThe oxygen transfer in MBRs can be im-\nproved by applying operating conditions affect-\ning the biomass characteristics found to have an\neffect on the oxygen transfer. By controlling the\namount of sludge wasted, the particle concentra-\ntion can be adjusted around a targeted value\n(Stephenson et al. 2000). Viscosity being expo-\nnentially correlated to the particle concentration,\na change in particle concentration will affect the\nviscosity. By keeping the particle concentration\nlow, the viscosity would be kept low too, leading\nto a better oxygen transfer. However, the effect\nof the particle size on oxygen transfer could not\nbe controlled. All the MBRs studied had large\nparticle size distributions, suggesting that nar-\nrower particle size distributions would not be ob-\nserved when changing the operating conditions.\nAeration, particle concentration, particle size\nand viscosity compensate each other effects on\noxygen transfer. For a better understanding of\nthe phenomena happening in aerated MBR bio-\nmass, closer investigations of each of its charac-\nteristics are needed to improve the aeration\nefficiency and so reduce the operating costs. Un-\ntil now, studies on MBRs have limited the\nparameters considered to solids concentration\nand viscosity. Other biomass characteristics need\nto be investigated, such as soluble microbial\nproducts (SMP) and extracellular polymer sub-\nstances (EPS). These compounds are produced\nby the microorganisms. SMP and EPS are both\nmainly of microbial origin (Wingeder et al.\n1999). SMP is soluble and is part of the liquid\nphase, whereas EPS is bounded to the cells and\ntherefore is part of the solid phase. In order to\nbe able to reach the active sites of the bacterial\ncell membrane, the oxygen contained in the air\nbubbles needs to penetrate the liquid film sur-\nrounding the flocs (SMP) and then diffuse\nthrough the floc matrix (EPS) (Mueller et al.\n2002). Therefore both compounds are likely to\naffect the oxygen transfer.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Thames\nWater for its financial support.\nReferences\nAbbassi B, Dullstein S & Rabiger N (1999) Minimization of\nexcess sludge production by increase of oxygen concentration\nin activated sludge flocs; experimental and theoretical\napproach.
