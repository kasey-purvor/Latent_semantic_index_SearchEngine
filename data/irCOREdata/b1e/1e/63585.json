They moult faster because they moult later in the season \nand are subject to more rapidly shortening daylengths. We tested this using a database \nof the plumage coloration (chroma, hue and lightness) of birds breeding in woods of \ndifferent sizes, by manipulating the speed of moult in captive Blue Tits, and by counting \nthe abundance and size of caterpillars (the major source of dietary carotenoids) in the \ndiet of nestlings. In accordance with our hypothesis, juveniles of both species  (which \nmoult about three weeks later than adults) were about 8% less saturated in colour (lower \nchroma) than adults, but there was no significant difference in chroma between habitats. \nHowever, both species did differ significantly in hue in large and small woods. Blue \nTits forced to moult faster in captivity, at a rate similar to that caused by a month\u2019s \ndelay in the start of moult, had yellow flank feathers that were 32% less saturated in \ncolour than those allowed to moult more slowly. Blue Tit nestlings in large woods \nconsumed 47% more caterpillar flesh (per gram of faecal material voided) than those in \nsmall woods, and Great Tit pulli 81% more. When habitat effects were controlled in \nANOVAs, Blue Tits mated assortatively on the basis of flank hue and Great Tits on the \nbasis of flank lightness. Flank colour therefore has the capacity to provide information \nabout the potential quality of both habitats and individual birds to potential colonists \nand sexual partners. \n 2\n The expression of carotenoid-based plumage coloration reflects the food provisioning \nrates of the males of several species, including the Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus (Hill \n1991, Linville et al. 1998, Senar & Escobar 2002, Senar et al. 2002, Isakson et al. \n2006). The yellow feathers of the underparts of Blue Tits and Great Tits Parus major \nare paler in a range of habitats assumed to be of poorer quality than deciduous \nwoodland. For example, this is the case in coniferous forest (Slagsvold & Lifjeld 1985), \nmixed forest (Figuerola et al. 1999, Figuerola & Senar 2005), and both polluted and \nurban habitats (Eeva et al. 1998, H\u00f5rak et al. 2000). One cross-fostering study in Great \nTits has shown that such colour differences are phenotypic in nestlings and therefore \nreflect habitat quality rather than genetic quality (H\u00f5rak et al. 2000), whilst others have \ndemonstrated both environmental and genetic effects in both species (Fitze et al. 2003a, \nJohnsen et al. 2003). The colour is assumed to be subject to sexual selection because it \nis correlated with male parental quality in Blue Tits (Senar et al. 2002, Johnsen et al. \n2005). \nWe know that habitat quality affects both breeding success (Hinsley et al. 1999) and \nthe timing of moult (Hinsley et al. 2003) in both Blue Tits and Great Tits in our study \narea. Individual tits breeding in small woods start laying eggs later, produce fewer \nchicks and moult later. Great Tits that moult later after the summer solstice, when \ndaylengths are shortening, moult faster (Bojarinova et al. 1999) and this is known to \ncompromise feather quality (Nilsson & Svensson 1996, Dawson et al. 2000, Hinsley et \nal. 2003, Dawson 2004).  \nWe therefore predicted that tits breeding in unfavourable habitats (small woods) \nwould be paler in colour because they breed later and consequently they and their \noffspring would moult later and faster, depositing less pigment per unit mass of feather \n 3\nthan they would in high quality habitats (large woods). We tested this possibility in two \nways. Firstly, we examined field data to determine whether the size of the wood in \nwhich Blue and Great Tits bred was correlated with the colour of their underparts, using \nour database of tit plumage coloration measured by reflectance spectrometry collected \nover a six-year period in woods of different sizes in Cambridgeshire, UK. Secondly, we \ndecreased the daylength of moulting Blue Tits in captivity, which is equivalent to \nforcing them to moult later in the year (as they do in small woods), and then measured \nthe colour of their plumage. Thirdly we examined the quality of the diet in different \nhabitats by counting the number, and measuring the size, of caterpillar jaws found in the \ndroppings of nestlings. Finally, we tested for assortative mating by measuring the colour \nof male and female parents caught at the same nest, and controlling for the effects of \nage and habitat in ANOVAs. \nWe are concerned here solely with the yellowness of the ventral plumage, caused \nmainly by the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin, since this colour has been found to be \ncorrelated with habitat and breeding parameters by previous workers. The UV \nreflectance of these carotenoids may be indicators of other qualities (Bleiweiss 2004).  \n \nMATERIAL AND METHODS \nColour measurements were made in the field on Blue Tits and Great Tits caught in \nnestboxes feeding chicks in large (26.9-156.8 ha, n = 4) and small (0.1-7.5 ha, n = 21) \nwoods located in arable farmland in East Anglia, UK (Hinsley et al. 1999). These were \nall caught within a relatively short time window each year (between April and June) and \nso seasonal changes in colour (Figuerola & Senar 2005) should have been minimal. \nMeasurements were made with a Minolta CR221 Chroma Meter which records colour \n 4\nin the region 400-700 nm, with a spectral response matching that of the CIE 1931 \nStandard Observer curves. Six measurements were made of the colour of the flank \nfeathers of each individual bird, moving the bird away from the sensor between each \nreading. The measuring area was a circle of 3 mm diameter, illuminated at 45\u00b0. The \ninstrument was calibrated using a certified standard white plate (CRA45) prior to the \nmeasurement of every bird. The repeatability of individual measurements was moderate \n(e.g. Blue Tit, chroma, R = 0.647, F19,120 = 11.99; hue, R = 0.549, F19,120 = 8.32; \nlightness, R = 0.748, F19,120 = 18.79; P < 0.0005 in all cases), whilst that of the mean of \nthe six measurements we used in all analyses was high (R = 0.815-0.938, P < 0.0001). \nBirds were aged using the criteria in Svensson (1992) and females identified by the \npresence of a wrinkled brood patch. Every one of the 77 pairs captured in this study \ncomprised one individual with a wrinkled brood patch and one without. Three colour \nparameters were recorded \u2013 chroma (higher values = greater colour saturation), hue (0\u00b0 \n= red, 90\u00b0 = yellow, 180\u00b0 = green) and lightness (black = 0%, white = 100%). These \nthree parameters were significantly correlated with one another in both species, but the \nlargest covariance (between lightness and chroma in Great Tits) was 27%, and the \naverage of the others was only 10%, so the three parameters were clearly worth \nanalysing separately. ANOVAs were therefore used to test for relationships between \nthese three colour parameters and the sex and age of the birds concerned, and the year \nand size of woodland in which they were caught. Only main effects and first order \ninteractions were included in these analyses. Since three colour parameters were \nanalysed, we applied a standard Bonferroni correction and only relationships significant \nat P < 0.017 were considered further. A total of 227 Blue Tits were caught (and 36 \nrecaptured) in the six years from 1996 to 2001, and 114 Great Tits caught (and 15 \n 5\nrecaptured) in the three years from 1996 to 1998. The recaptures were not included in \nthe analyses. \nFor the moult trials, adult Blue Tits (at least one year old) were captured in Monk\u2019s \nWood (good habitat) under licence in July and early August, at a time when they had \njust started primary and body feather moult. They were housed in individual cages in \none of two identical rooms with different artificial daylengths (Dawson et al. 2000). \nEqual numbers of birds (n = 5) were included in both groups, and all were female \nexcept for a single male in the long daylength group. In one room, the daylength was a \nconstant 18 hours, in the other it decreased by one hour each week until it reached 12 \nhours and was then kept constant. Each bird was provided with food (mealworms, \n\u201cProsecto\u201d, egg biscuit, peanuts and fresh green lettuce) and water ad libitum. The rate \nof feather moult was recorded at approximately weekly intervals by scoring all the \nprimaries of one wing (Newton 1966). We used wing moult as an index of moult speed \nbecause it is possible to record its rate of progression with greater precision than is the \ncase with the body feathers (Dawson 2004). In individual corvids, the timings of feather \nmoult in the primary and ventral tracts were found to be quite consistent relative to one \nanother (Seel 1976), and the same was true of our Blue Tits. In tits, the ventral tract is \nthe first part of the body plumage to commence moult (Dhondt 1973, Rymkevich & \nBojarinova 1996) and is thus concurrent with most of primary moult, though it lasts \nseveral weeks longer (Cramp & Perrins 1993). We analysed the moult scores in a \nrepeated measures ANCOVA in which subject (individual birds) constituted a random \nvariable nested within treatments, time was a covariate, and subject was used as the \nerror sum of squares for the main effect (daylength). Plumage colour was measured as \nsoon as the flank feathers had finished moulting, which was about a month later in the \n 6\nlong daylength group. The single male bird in the latter group was not included in the \nanalysis of flank colour because captive males have been found to deposit more \ncarotenoid in their feathers when maintained on the same diet as females in the \nAmerican Goldfinch (McGraw et al. 2002). \nDroppings were collected from 11-day old chicks and stored in 70% alcohol for 4-8 \nmonths before being analysed. Excretory and faecal materials were separated, \ncaterpillar jaws were removed and their lengths (base to tip of longest tooth, at right \nangles to the base) measured, before oven-drying the faeces. The jaws were counted, \nmeasured and converted into the equivalent dry mass of caterpillar flesh per gram dry \nmass of nestling faeces using a logarithmic regression derived from 96 caterpillars (size \nrange 1-238 mg dry mass) collected from both habitats in 1998-2000. Caterpillars were \ncombined for this purpose regardless of family or species since it was not possible to \nidentify most of them (c.f. Gosler 1987). \nParental flank colour was corrected for the effects of the significant variables \nidentified in Table 1 (other than sex) by ANOVA, and major axis regression performed \non male and female residuals to test for assortative mating. This correction had to be \nmade to avoid spurious correlations arising from common environmental influences, \nnotably wood size. As before, only those relationships significant after Bonferroni \ncorrection (P < 0.017) were considered further. Forty five pairs of Great Tits were \ntrapped for this purpose in 1996-1998, and 32 pairs of Blue Tits in 1999-2001.  \n \n 7\nRESULTS \nFlank colour in the field \nAlthough both Blue Tits and Great Tits were more saturated with colour in high quality \nhabitat in the field, in neither case was this effect statistically significant. However, \nBlue Tits breeding in different habitats differed significantly in hue, those in high \nquality woods being a significantly greener shade of yellow (F1,200 = 10.38, P = 0.001) \n(Table 1). The size of this difference was small, amounting to 0.33\u00b0 in males and 0.59\u00b0 \nin females. Males had a significantly larger hue angle than females (F1,200 = 86.65, P < \n0.0005), and females were significantly lighter than males (F1,200 = 20.05, P < 0.0005). \nThere was no significant sexual difference in saturation (chroma, F1,200 = 1.90, P = \n0.169). \nIndividual Great Tits from high quality habitat were, like Blue Tits, a significantly \ngreener shade of yellow than those from poor habitat (F1,97 = 10.01, P = 0.002). Unlike \nBlue Tits, they were also significantly lighter (F1,97 = 7.99, P = 0.006). Males had a \nsignificantly larger hue angle than females (F1,97 = 42.79, P < 0.0005), and were also \nsignificantly lighter (F1,97 = 14.75, P < 0.0005) and more fully saturated with colour \n(F1,97 = 8.03, P = 0.006).  \nThe original hypothesis was supported in relation to age, since adults moult earlier \nthan juveniles, and adults were more saturated in colour in both species (Blue Tit, F1,200 \n= 10.81, P = 0.001; Great Tit, F1,97 = 11.75, P = 0.001). It was not upheld in relation to \nhabitat quality, however, since the colour was not significantly more saturated in better \nhabitat. \nThe only significant interaction in all of these ANOVAs (for full details see supp mat) \nwas the year versus wood interaction in Blue Tit lightness (F5,200 = 4.30, P = 0.001). In \n 8\ntwo years of the study, birds from large woods were lighter, and in the other four, birds \nfrom small woods were lighter. \n \nMoult in captivity \nBlue Tits subjected to short daylengths in captivity moulted their primaries and body \nfeathers significantly faster than those on long daylengths (repeated measures \nANCOVA, F1,8 = 5.92, P = 0.041). The fitted regression lines showed rates of increase \nin moult score per day that were nearly twice as fast in the short daylength group (mean \n\u00b1 SE = 0.48 \u00b1 0.03) as they were in the long daylength group (0.25 \u00b1 0.02). This \ncontrasted with a rate of about 0.65 per day for birds in the field (Ginn & Melville \n1983), indicating that taking Blue Tits into captivity reduced the rate of moult, even in \nthe birds subjected to shortening days.  \nThere was no significant difference in the lightness or hue of the flank feathers of \nthese two groups of birds after they had moulted. However, the flanks of the birds on \nshort daylengths (Fig. 1, mean chroma \u00b1 SE = 19 \u00b1 6) were significantly less saturated \nwith yellow pigment than those on long daylengths (28 \u00b1 2). The original expectation \nwas thus upheld. The birds on long daylengths did not differ significantly in saturation \nfrom adults measured in the field (Table 1, t152 = 0.88, P > 0.100). Short daylength birds \ndid differ from adults in the field (t151 = -2.10, P = 0.020-0.050), but not from juveniles \n(t116 = -0.68, P > 0.100). \n \nDiet \nFaecal pellets were collected from 171 Blue Tit and 142 Great Tit broods in 1998-2004 \nand the size of over 3,000 caterpillars estimated from jaws contained therein. Both \n 9\nspecies fed a greater mass of caterpillars to their young in high quality habitat than they \ndid in small woods, though only in Great Tits was the difference significant (one-tailed \npaired t-test on yearly means (Fig. 2). The droppings of nestlings from large woods \ncontained caterpillar jaws representing 47% greater dry mass of caterpillars per gram \ndry mass of faeces in Blue Tits and 81% greater in Great Tits. \n \nAssortative mating \nWhen significant age and habitat effects were controlled in ANOVAs, there was no \nsignificant assortative mating on the basis of residual chroma in either species, but there \nwas on the basis of residual hue in Blue Tits (Fig. 3a, F1,30 = 12.42, P = 0.001, R2 = \n0.293) and residual lightness in Great Tits (Fig. 3b, F1,43 = 6.41, P = 0.015, R2 = 0.130). \nLightness is a measure the total amount of light reflected, regardless of hue or chroma, \nand so this means that Great Tits that appeared brighter tended to be paired together. \nThe effect size, and statistical significance, of this assortative mating was very similar \nwhen the actual colour scores were used rather than the residuals (R2 = 0.287 and 0.184 \nrespectively). \n \nDISCUSSION \nThe largest differences in colour observed in the field were those between the chroma of \nadults and juveniles, with adults being more saturated. This difference was consistent in \nboth sexes and habitats. This is in accordance with our original hypothesis, since \njuvenile body feathers are moulted about three weeks later than those of adults (present \nresults, Flegg & Cox 1969, Ginn & Melville 1983, Cramp & Perrins 1983). As well as \nmoulting faster than adults, juveniles may also be less efficient at absorbing or utilising \n 10\ndietary carotenoids (Hill 2002). The flanks of male Great Tits, but not Blue Tits, were \nalso more saturated with colour than those of females.  \nAs expected, Blue Tits forced to moult quickly grew feathers that were less fully \nsaturated with yellow pigment, but they did not differ significantly in hue or lightness. \nHue is a measure of the dominant wavelength of the reflected light and would not be \nexpected to differ in birds fed an identical diet, and in which the carotenoids responsible \nfor the yellow coloration are deposited in an unmodified form in the feathers (see \nbelow).  \nAlthough there were significant differences in colour between tits breeding in high \nand low quality habitats, the differences did not correspond to those induced in the \nlaboratory, since they involved hue and lightness, but not chroma. The different \nresponse of birds in the field and in captivity was probably due to the fact that our short \ndaylength regime forced the birds to moult at a rate almost twice that of controls, which \nwas a much larger differential than occurs between birds in large and small woods in \nthe field. Moult was only delayed by a week on average in small woods (Hinsley et al. \n2003), and a delay three times greater than this only reduced body moult duration in \njuvenile Great Tits and primary moult in starlings by about 12% (Bojarinova et al. \n1999, A. Dawson unpublished data). In retrospect, therefore, we accelerated the moult \nof our short daylength birds (relative to controls) more than would have resulted from \nthe difference in timing between habitats of different quality. Although we could not \nhave predicted it in advance, we accelerated the body moult of short daylength birds to \napproximately that of juveniles in the field, and consequently fast moulting captives and \njuveniles from the field did not differ significantly in chroma. Forcing birds to moult \nfaster than normal, by subjecting them to daylengths that are too short may be one of \n 11\nthe factors that leads to the loss of normal carotenoid coloration in captive birds (see \nHudon 1994). \nHigh quality habitat did, however, contain birds with larger hue angles. Thus \ndominant wavelengths closer to green (though still much closer to yellow than green) \nare characteristic of individuals from better quality habitats (present study and Figuerola \net al. 1999). This suggests a difference in deposited (and therefore ingested) \ncarotenoids. The yellow colour of the underparts of these two species is due to the \npresence of the carotenoids \u03b2-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin in the feathers (Partali et \nal. 1987). Adding lutein and zeaxanthin to the diet of nestling Great Tits when they \nwere growing their juvenile plumage in the nest, increased the intensity of the yellow \ncoloration of their breast plumage (Fitze et al. 2003b). Partali et al. (1987) also found \nthat the body feathers of nestling Great Tits from deciduous woods contained more \ncarotenoids by weight than those from coniferous woods. According to the latter \nauthors, the carotenoids are derived unmodified from the diet of the birds. Caterpillars \nprovide a major source of these carotenoids, especially lutein, which is preferentially \nabsorbed from the leaves on which the caterpillars feed. The ratio of lutein to \nzeaxanthin is higher in the plumage of chicks reared in deciduous woodland than it is in \nconiferous woodland (Partali et al. 1987) and the proportion of caterpillars in the diet is \nhigher (Cramp & Perrins 1983). Moreover, birds with greater access to caterpillars have \na high ratio of lutein to zeaxanthin in the diet, since this is what caterpillars themselves \ncontain (Partali et al. 1987). Lutein has peak absorbances at shorter wavelengths (422, \n445 and 473 nm in acetone) than zeaxanthin (425, 450 and 476 nm), and thus a higher \nratio of lutein to zeaxanthin should result in slightly shorter absorbed wavelengths. This, \nin turn, would decrease the dominant reflected wavelength, shifting it slightly towards \n 12\nthe green. This is exactly what occurred in both species of tits in our large deciduous \nwoods. \nCaterpillar abundance declines throughout the course of the birds\u2019 breeding season as \nthe larvae mature and pupate (Lack 1966). However, it seems reasonable to assume that \nbirds that have access to more and larger caterpillars during chick rearing, have \nsimilarly improved access (despite reduced caterpillar numbers), during the moult. \nReduced caterpillar availability as the season progresses may also account for the \nsuccessively smaller hue angles (less green shade of yellow) recorded in Great Tits \ncompared with Blue Tits; and in both species, of females compared with males (Table \n1). Great Tits are known to moult slightly later than Blue Tits, and females slightly later \nthan males (Ginn & Melville 1983). \nAlthough the above interpretation is consistent with the few existing measurements of \nthe carotenoid content of the flank feathers of these species and their caterpillar diet in \ndifferent habitats, it remains a tentative one until more complete measurements are \nmade of the carotenoid content of the feathers of birds of different ages, sexes, and with \ndifferent diets. Simulations have shown, for example, that an increasing concentration \nof lutein alone (without any change in lutein to zeaxanthin ratio), should produce a shift \nin yellow away from green towards red i.e. lower hue angles (Andersson & Prager \n2006). Moreover, the presence of small amounts of melanin could be responsible for \nshifting the yellow of carotenoids towards the green to varying extents (Andersson & \nPrager 2006). The carotenoid content of caterpillars, as well as their numbers, may also \ndiffer between habitats. \nThe yellow colour of individual resident males (i.e. local moulters), provides \ndispersing females searching for mates with information about the potential quality of \n 13\ntheir woods, and provides each party with information about the other\u2019s foraging \nabilities. The latter is supported by Senar et al.\u2019s (2002) finding that male foster parent \nBlue Tits with larger hue angles reared young with longer tarsi, and that our Blue Tits \npaired assortatively on the basis of flank hue. Hidalgo-Garcia (2006) found that Blue \nTits in Spain paired assortatively on the basis of both chroma and lightness, and that the \nlightest birds raised heavier young with a stronger immune response. The fact that our \nGreat Tits paired assortatively on the basis of lightness may be because, all other things \nbeing equal, it is best to select the mate with the cleanest, least worn or least faded (and \ntherefore brightest) plumage. Figuerola & Senar (2005) found that fading was the main \nfactor effecting seasonal changes in the breast colour of individual Great Tits. More \ngenerally, flank colour provides all individuals, searching for suitable sites in which to \nsettle, with two sorts of information about individual and habitat quality. Firstly, the \naverage colour saturation (chroma) of residents\u2019 flanks provides potential information \non the local timing of breeding and moulting, such as that associated with woodland \ntype e.g. coniferous versus deciduous (Slagsvold & Lifjeld 1985), whilst the saturation \nof particular individuals reflects their likely parental quality within the local area \n(especially the lack of breeding experience in juveniles). Secondly, the hue of residents\u2019 \nflanks may provide information on the quality of the local food supply e.g. caterpillar \nabundance, and each individual bird\u2019s capacity to exploit it.  \n \nWe are grateful to A.
