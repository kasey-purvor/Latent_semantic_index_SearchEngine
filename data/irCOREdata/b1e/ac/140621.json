Introduction and context 23 \nInternationally, the last two decades have witnessed a large number of microbial and chemical 24 \ncontamination incidents (Table 1), many of which have led to illness and even fatalities in the community.  In 25 \ndeveloped countries, the most serious of these was the 1993 cryptosporidiosis outbreak in Milwaukee (Lisle 26 \nand Rose, 1995; Solo-Gabriele and Neumeister, 1996; Deininger, 2004; Hrudey and Hrudey, 2004).  27 \nCryptosporidium parvum is a human and animal pathogen that has exhibited some resistance to the 28 \nconventional water disinfection method of chlorination (Smith et al., 1990).  Water companies have therefore 29 \n                                                 \n* Corresponding author. Tel: +44 (0) 1234 750 111 x 2570; Fax: +44 (0) 1234 751 671.

In examining the cause of the Milwaukee outbreak, studies such as Lisle and Rose (1995) 2 \nhighlighted a number of flaws in the design and operation at the treatment plant in question; not least a 3 \nprolonged period of poor coagulation control and filter performance, evidenced by vast increases in the 4 \nmeasured turbidity of water leaving the works.  This and other diagnosed incidents in Australia, Canada, 5 \nJapan, UK, and the USA (Baudin and La\u00een\u00e9, 1998) have led to an increased global awareness of the potential 6 \nconsequences of waterborne cryptosporidiosis and other microbial diseases and have reinforced the need to 7 \nmaintain high standards of process design and operation at vulnerable water treatment works. 8 \n 9 \nTable 1   10 \nSome documented water quality incidents 11 \n 12 \nA further defining moment was the 1998 Cryptosporidium crisis in Sydney (McClellan, 1998; 13 \nCunliffe, 2003; Hrudey and Hrudey, 2004).  A \u2018boil water\u2019 notice was issued after a high concentration of 14 \nGiardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in raw and treated waters.  Fortunately, the pathogens 15 \nwere found to be inactive and no illness in the community resulted, although it did serve as a wake-up call for 16 \nthe industry, both in terms of catchment management and the way risks are communicated to the public.  For 17 \ncommentators such as Deere and Davison (1998) and Cunliffe (2003), the Sydney incident highlighted the 18 \nlimitations of management based purely on end-product monitoring, and the lack of a coordinated approach to 19 \ndealing with water quality. 20 \nSoon after, another incident, this time resulting in fatalities, took place in Walkerton (Canada) in 21 \n2000.  Here, the water supply became contaminated with microbial pathogens after manure was spread on a 22 \nfarm near a public supply well.  More than 2,300 people became ill and seven people died.  The official 23 \ninquiry (O\u2019Connor, 2002) reported a litany of bad practice prior to and during the incident including the 24 \nfailure of operational staff to maintain effective chlorination of the water supply and carry out routine chlorine 25 \nresidual checks, the falsification of water quality records by staff and the failure of treatment managers to 26 \nrespond satisfactorily to positive microbial tests, any one of which may have significantly reduced the impact 27 \nof the incident or prevented it altogether.  The official report into the Walkerton incident (O\u2019Connor, 2002) 28 \nrecommended that water suppliers adopt a Total Quality Management system based upon 29 \n3 \n\u2022 the adoption of best practices and continuous improvement; 1 \n\u2022 \u2018real time\u2019 process control (e.g. continuous monitoring of turbidity, chlorine residual, and 2 \ndisinfectant contact time) wherever feasible; 3 \n\u2022 the effective operation of robust multiple barriers to protect public health; 4 \n\u2022 preventative rather than strictly reactive strategies to identify and manage risks to public health; and 5 \n\u2022 effective leadership. 6 \nProviding safe drinking water requires sound risk management.  This is recognised in, and forms the 7 \ncentral feature of, the recent revision to the WHO\u2019s (World Health Organisation\u2019s) drinking water guidelines 8 \n(WHO, 2004).  The rationale for this approach is that delivering safe water is not just about achieving a high 9 \nlevel of compliance (Walker, 2005).  Water supply systems can attain this and yet can still have serious latent 10 \nflaws in their design or operation that are \u2018accidents waiting to happen\u2019.  These may include uncontrolled 11 \ncontamination hazards in water catchments, flaws in treatment design, leaks in distribution systems, and bad 12 \noperational practices. 13 \nWater safety plans are frameworks or \u2018route maps\u2019 that set out preventative, step by step processes 14 \nfor managing water contamination risks.  At an international workshop in Bonn, recommendations were 15 \nmade, with the aim of providing \u201cgood, safe drinking water that has the trust of customers\u201d (AWWA et al., 16 \n2001).  Key principles were set out for creating an integrated approach to water safety across the four stages 17 \nof water supply: (a) catchment, (b) treatment, (c) distribution and (d) customer plumbing systems.  It was also 18 \nrecognised, that close cooperation is required between water suppliers, governments, health agencies, 19 \nenvironmental agencies, land users and other stakeholder groups to maintain and promote drinking water 20 \nsafety.  After a second workshop in 2004, the Bonn Charter was published (IWA, 2004), setting out high level 21 \nframeworks describing both the operational and institutional arrangements for managing water supplies. 22 \nOne country that has driven much of the development of water safety plans is Australia.  In 1996, the 23 \nNational Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) revised its Australian Drinking Water Guidelines 24 \n(NHMRC, 1996).  This highlighted that testing does not guarantee the safety of water supplies (as it is quite 25 \npossible that contamination will occur between sampling events) and stressed the importance of additionally 26 \nmaintaining \u2018effective barriers to prevent contamination of the water supply system.\u2019  In 2001, the NHMRC 27 \nreleased its \u2018Framework for Management of Drinking Water Quality\u2019 (NHMRC, 2001).  The Framework 28 \n4 \nlisted a sequence of 12 elements it considered to be good practice for the management of drinking water 1 \nsupplies from catchment to consumer.  In 2002, the NHMRC provisionally redrafted its guidelines (NHMRC, 2 \n2002), incorporating the Framework\u2019s 12 elements as its focus.  An amended draft was officially endorsed 3 \ntwo years later (NHMRC, 2004).  This was intended to introduce a standard approach throughout the industry 4 \nand establish due diligence and credibility.  The process is divided up into four main sections: 5 \n\u2022 a commitment to drinking water quality management; 6 \n\u2022 system analysis and management; 7 \n\u2022 supporting requirements e.g. employee training, community involvement, research and development, 8 \nsystems for documenting and reporting etc.; and 9 \n\u2022 review. 10 \nIn a field that is largely practitioner-led, the development and implementation of water safety plans 11 \nhave varied widely.  The following study considers several different approaches to water safety planning and 12 \nproposes a conceptualisation that brings water safety plans and other quality management initiatives together 13 \nunder a single umbrella.  Finally it looks briefly at wider risk management practices carried out by the 14 \nindustry.  Utilities are seeking to adopt a more consistent, integrated approach to managing risks across their 15 \norganisations, a trend which is likely to further affect the development of water safety plans. 16 \n 17 \n2. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach 18 \nMost water safety plans (e.g. NHMRC, 2004; NZMOH, 2001; UKWIR, 2003; WHO, 2004) 19 \npublished to date have been based on adaptive forms of the HACCP procedure.  Its application within the 20 \nwater sector has been widely discussed in the literature (e.g. Havelaar, 1994; Deere and Davison, 1998; Deere 21 \net al., 2001; Stevens, 2003; Hrudey and Hrudey, 2004).  In brief, HACCP was developed by the US Space 22 \nAgency in the 1960s to ensure the safe manufacture of foodstuffs to be used in spaceflight.  It was quickly 23 \nimplemented across the food industry, and in principle, provides a hazard-based monitoring system for 24 \nprotecting water supplies from different contaminants.  In 1997, the Codex Alimentarius Commission 25 \nreleased its most recent guidelines for HACCP application within the food industry (CAC, 1997), restating its 26 \nseven key principles: 27 \n1.  Conduct a hazard analysis. 28 \n5 \n2.  Determine the critical control points (CCP). 1 \n3. Establish critical limit(s). 2 \n4. Establish a system to monitor control of the CCP. 3 \n5. Establish the corrective action to be taken when monitoring indicates that a particular CCP is 4 \nnot under control. 5 \n6.  Establish procedures for verification to confirm that the HACCP system is working effectively. 6 \n7.  Establish documentation concerning all procedures and records appropriate to these principles 7 \nand their application. 8 \nHACCP promotes the proactive management of hazards through the identification of \u2018critical control 9 \npoints\u2019 where they can be monitored and reduced.  Its application to drinking water supplies was first 10 \ndescribed in the Netherlands by Havelaar (1994).  Since then it has gained some prominence internationally, 11 \nbut has been championed, in particular, by the Australian water industry. Following the 1998 12 \nCryptosporidium crisis in Sydney, Deere and Davison (1998) argued that Sydney Water should adopt a full 13 \nHACCP system as the most cost-effective means of assuring drinking water safety, pointing out that the UK 14 \nsystem of increased end-product monitoring (for Cryptosporidium) had been designed primarily for legal 15 \nreasons and not specifically to protect the public. 16 \nIn terms of water safety, a limitation of the HACCP methodology, as originally conceived, is that it 17 \nis largely concerned with hazards, not risks.  Hrudey and Hrudey (2004) acknowledge that \u201ca formalized 18 \nstructure has evolved with HACCP in the food industry and the prospect of (water suppliers) being HACCP-19 \ncertified is appealing.  These considerations need not be an impediment to effective application of the useful 20 \nHACCP principles.  The caution is that HACCP must be sensibly and pragmatically adapted to identify 21 \nhazards and then to assess and manage their associated risks for drinking water systems\u201d.  This perceived 22 \nweakness was partially addressed by CAC (1997), at least in principle, which recommended that an 23 \nassessment of hazard severity and likelihood could be conducted as part of the \u2018hazard analysis\u2019 process.    24 \nIndeed, the most credible advocates of the HACCP procedure for drinking water systems such as Mullenger et 25 \nal. (2002) and Hellier (2003) have also extended their plans to incorporate elements of risk assessment, 26 \ntypically employing a semi-quantitative method for ranking likelihood and consequence of initiating events.   27 \n6 \nProgressing from hazard management to effective risk management requires a richer understanding 1 \nof the technical, managerial and humans systems within which risks may be realised (Pollard et al., 2005).  2 \nNHMRC (2004) point out that HACCP\u2019s scope and application is limited in several important areas such as 3 \nemployee training, emergency response and community involvement.  As they concede, however, HACCP 4 \nwas never designed to be a fully comprehensive management system, but was intended to be added on to 5 \nexisting, good management practices.  The NHRMC (2004) Framework therefore draws not only from 6 \nHACCP, but also from other established systems such as ISO 9001 (ISO, 2000) and AS\/NZS 4360 (AS\/NZS, 7 \n1999) and is itself designed to be flexible and be integrated with other programmes and systems already 8 \npresent in organisations.  Thus, although HACCP can be considered to be a blueprint for many water safety 9 \nplans, it has also been largely superseded by these newer frameworks.  10 \nAnother contentious issue regarding HACCP is the question of how readily the concept of CCPs can 11 \nbe transferred to the water industry.  Codex Alimentarius Commission (1997) defines a CCP as \u201ca step at 12 \nwhich control can be applied and is essential to prevent or eliminate a food safety hazard or reduce it to an 13 \nacceptable level.\u201d  When trying to apply this within the context of water safety, however, it is sometimes 14 \ndifficult to gauge the criticality of the CCP i.e. what determines a control as \u2018essential\u2019.  Nokes and Taylor 15 \n(2003), for example, have argued that by concentrating on CCPs, water suppliers may perceive that they need 16 \nto identify only a limited number of control points at the expense of a wide range of other \u2018preventative 17 \nmeasures\u2019 that may also be important in reducing risk.  Another potential difficulty with using HACCP 18 \ndirectly within the water industry is that the concepts of \u2018control points\u2019 and \u2018critical limits\u2019 tend to be viable 19 \nonly when applied to treatment processes (Hellier, 2003; Nokes and Taylor, 2003), which are amenable to, 20 \nand thus receive a more intense, varied and quantitative level of monitoring than other stages in the water 21 \nsupply chain; catchment management, for example. 22 \nDespite this, however, advocates of HACCP\u2019s such as Mullenger et al. (2002) and Hellier (2003) 23 \nmaintain that its application can yield several advantages to drinking water safety.  In the case of Melbourne 24 \nWater, Hellier (2003) concludes that their resulting HACCP document became a road-mapping of all the 25 \nsystems that control drinking water quality and due to the introduction of regular auditing  became a driving 26 \nforce for improving systems.  In particular, Hellier cites five areas of improvement: 27 \n\u2022 the development of 15 new operational procedures; 28 \n7 \n\u2022 an evaluation of catchdrains around reservoirs; 1 \n\u2022 an adjustment of treatment plant alarm settings; 2 \n\u2022 documentation of corrective actions plans; and  3 \n\u2022 training of operators on response levels to alarms at critical sites. 4 \nSimilarly, Mullenger et al. (2002) relate positive experiences from South East Water\u2019s (Australia) 5 \nimplementation of a HACCP plan across all of its water operations.  Although staff were initially 6 \n\u2018unenthusiastic\u2019 about the initiative, its adoption appeared to lead to an increase in knowledge and 7 \nunderstanding of the water supply system at all levels and an improved ability to identify hazards to water 8 \nquality or supply.  This is a frequently cited outcome of many such management systems in that the analysis 9 \nitself reveals enhanced knowledge of system behaviour and vulnerability. This had led to a number of changes 10 \nto operating procedures. 11 \nAnother example is presented in Metge et al. (2003), who describe the application of HACCP on 12 \nthree critical plants on the Morsang sur Seine River in France.  Their analysis realised three key hazardous 13 \nevents: 14 \n\u2022 aluminium contamination due to coagulant overfeeding; 15 \n\u2022 microbiological contamination due to chlorine underfeeding; and 16 \n\u2022 microbiological contamination due to chlorine dysfunction. 17 \nCritical limits were set for chlorine and residual aluminium concentrations.  Although it is possible that this 18 \nexercise did provide some benefit (e.g. through the tightening of controls), HACCP and water safety plans in 19 \ngeneral, will only be useful if they lead to a demonstrable and actionable improvements either in 20 \nunderstanding or in the design or operation of a water supply system.  If the approach is to be truly proactive, 21 \nwater suppliers should try to avoid identifying hazards retrospectively to suit existing controls; otherwise the 22 \nexercise may become bureaucratic and tend towards tokenism rather than active risk management. 23 \nPerhaps the most critical aspect to HACCP and water safety plans is that these may inadvertently 24 \nbecome exercises in documenting something that companies already do rather than a step change in the 25 \napproach to managing risk.  A salutary lesson for risk managers can be learned from commentaries on the 26 \nimplementation of the international quality standard ISO 9000 (Seddon, 2000; Hoyle, 2001).  Hoyle (2001) 27 \nargues that although some organisations used the standard wisely, for many, it became a \u2018badge on the wall\u2019 28 \n8 \nwith little to do with improving performance.  Some believed the standard was only about documenting what 1 \nthey did.  Moreover, the persistence of auditors to require documentation led to situations where 2 \ndocumentation only existed in case something went wrong.  A similar point is made by Hrudey and Hrudey 3 \n(2004) regarding HACCP, namely that if it is pursued primarily for public relations, little risk reduction may 4 \nbe achieved. 5 \n 6 \n3. Multiple barrier approach 7 \nAlthough many would contend that the HACCP system does not preclude a \u2018multiple barrier\u2019 8 \napproach to water quality management, arguably neither does it really promote this line (Nokes and Taylor, 9 \n2003).  In developing their water safety plans, many water suppliers\/administrators have sought to take a 10 \nbroader perspective, looking at the widest possible range of \u2018preventative\u2019 or \u2018control measures\u2019 from 11 \ncatchment to tap to protect the public.  These can include qualitative checks and measures such as the regular 12 \ninspection of catchment areas as well as continuous on-line monitoring.  For example, the WHO recently set 13 \nout an authoritative ten-step process for developing safety plans for water systems (WHO, 2004).  As with the 14 \nNHMRC (2004) guidelines, this advocates that water suppliers focus on the broadest possible range of 15 \n\u2018control measures\u2019.  In the UK, a set of frameworks and guidance material has recently been published to help 16 \nwater companies implement water safety plans from catchment to tap (UKWIR, 2003).  Again the focus has 17 \nbeen placed on \u2018risk reduction measures\u2019 rather than CCPs for hazards.  A practical set of guidelines has also 18 \nbeen developed by the New Zealand Ministry of Health (NZMOH, 2001).  This promotes the concept of 19 \nmultiple barriers although here, a conscious decision was made to focus on hazard identification by reference 20 \nto the initiating events or situations that may lead to hazards being introduced in the water.  As reviewed by 21 \nPollard et al. (2004), the NZMOH approach targets smaller systems and may be particularly valuable for 22 \nsystems with limited technical resources.  The rationale behind the NZMOH framework is explained in Nokes 23 \nand Taylor (2003).  They reflect that for smaller water suppliers, whose operational staff may be less familiar 24 \nwith water quality issues, it may be simpler for them to try to prevent certain, well-accepted hazardous events 25 \nfrom occurring at the plant level (e.g. the loss of chlorination) rather than trying to direct spare resources to 26 \nhazards they may know little about and have less control over (e.g. E. coli, Cryptosporidium in catchments). 27 \n 28 \n9 \n3.1 Assessing barrier integrity 1 \nOnce contamination barriers have been identified within a system, water suppliers need to 2 \ndemonstrate their effectiveness continuously either through direct measurement or a programme of spot 3 \nchecks and\/or maintenance.  Many treatment barriers can be assessed by on-line monitoring and sample 4 \nanalysis.  A common means of assessing treatment barriers for the protozoan pathogen Cryptosporidium, for 5 \nexample, is to measure the removal of water turbidity across a treatment process. This is typically cited as a 6 \nlog-removal which conveys the order of magnitude of the removal. For example, \u20181-log\u2019 removal is 7 \nequivalent to a 90% reduction, \u20182-log\u2019 equivalent to a 99% reduction etc.  Studies have shown that there is 8 \noften a direct correlation between the level of particles removed by a process and the removal of microbial 9 \npathogens such as Cryptosporidium oocysts (Hamilton et al., 2002).  A criticism that could be leveled at some 10 \napproaches to barrier analysis is that approaches may be driven more by a willingness to comply and less by 11 \nconcern for assessing and managing risk, leading to a progressive overstating of a barrier\u2019s effectiveness.  12 \nOften overlooked is the significance of (a) barrier integrity and (b) barrier independence. 13 \nTwo concepts that are highly relevant with regard to barrier integrity are \u2018bad days and bypass\u2019 14 \n(Gale, 2002).  \u2018Bypass\u2019 can be envisaged as \u2018spatial variation\u2019 where certain areas within each batch (i.e. a 15 \nproportion of water to be treated) are not treated to the full extent or where raw material continuously 16 \ncontaminates each batch of treated material.  In contrast, \u2018bad days\u2019 occur when the overall treatment 17 \nefficiency falters or fails completely for a time giving rise to \u2018temporal\u2019 variation.  Using probabilistic event 18 \ntrees, Gale (2002) shows how \u2018bad days\u2019 can have a substantial effect on overall treatment performance.   For 19 \nexample, if a process that typically operates at 4-log (99.99%) oocyst removal drops down to 1-log (90%) 20 \nremoval, say for 5% of the time, then the net result is that effectively the overall performance of the process is 21 \nreduced to 2.3-logs (Fig. 1). The net risk of Cryptosporidium oocyst presence in the drinking water supplied 22 \nto consumers is therefore increased fifty-fold.  This can have serious implications in terms of risk 23 \nmanagement and shows the need to understand and target the weak points in process barriers. 24 \n 25 \nFig. 1. An example showing impact of \u2018bad days\u2019 on overall effectiveness of a treatment process (after Gale, 2002). 26 \n 27 \n\u2018Bypass\u2019 can have a similar deleterious effect on a system.  Gale (2002) describes a hypothetical 28 \nsituation where adding extra filtration stages to a treatment process to increase Cryptosporidium oocyst 29 \n10 \nremoval, yields diminishing returns if a small proportion of raw water bypasses the works in some way e.g. as 1 \na result of infiltration within the distribution system.  For example, under a scenario where 1% of the total 2 \nflow bypasses treatment, a 3-log (99.9%) or higher removal system is effectively reduced to a 2-log (99%) 3 \nsystem.  Examples of bypass within the field of water supply include: 4 \n\u2022 exposure of populations to microbial pathogens through less tightly regulated private water supplies; 5 \n\u2022 ingress into water supply distribution systems; 6 \n\u2022 short-circuiting of raw water storage reservoirs; 7 \n\u2022 surface water intrusion into groundwater supplies; 8 \n\u2022 deliberate bypass of a treatment stage; 9 \n\u2022 reduced filter effectiveness during ripening after backwashing; 10 \n\u2022 failure by staff to observe correct operational procedures and practices;  11 \n\u2022 improper application of fertilizers and pesticides to land in drinking water catchments; 12 \n\u2022 illegal discharge of trade wastes into sewers or water courses upstream of a treatment works; and 13 \n\u2022 sabotage or deliberately released contamination. 14 \nThere can be a tendency for treatment scientists to cite their works\u2019 performance in terms of 15 \npercentile statistics.  Although this may be a sensible approach when benchmarking plant performance or 16 \npresenting regulatory compliance, for example, to allow otherwise well-run works some leeway, arguably this 17 \nis not compatible with a true water safety approach.  In terms of risk management, emphasis should be placed 18 \non identifying weak spots within the process flowsheet and testing worst-case event scenarios and not merely 19 \nin achieving a level of compliance.  Care must be taken not to be complacent when assessing barriers, despite 20 \nthe obvious requirement to satisfy water quality regulators and the public.  In order to engender a proactive 21 \nand transparent culture of risk management within the water supply industry, a different mindset may need to 22 \nbe adopted by water suppliers and regulatory bodies alike when dealing with risk as opposed to 23 \nstraightforward compliance issues. 24 \nBarriers should also exhibit a high degree of independency of one another, so that failure of one 25 \nbarrier does not reduce the efficacy of subsequent barriers.  In terms of water treatment, a potential problem is 26 \nposed by flooding or river spate conditions that may have a \u2018domino effect\u2019 in reducing the effectiveness of 27 \ntreatment barriers in succession.  Rapidly deteriorating raw water quality presents complications for operators 28 \n11 \ntrying to maintain optimal coagulant dosing, which in turn can lead to sub-optimal filter performance and 1 \nincreased chlorine demand.  This issue is also discussed in LeChevallier and Au (2004).   A good example of 2 \nan independent barrier is the use of ultraviolet (uv) irradiation plants alongside conventional physical barriers 3 \n(clarification and filtration) to deactivate microbial pathogens in the final water.  Although, increased particle 4 \nnumbers in treated water do reduce the effectiveness of uv irradiation, studies by Christensen and Linden 5 \n(2003) have shown that the effect is negligible in water below 10 NTU turbidity, a level far in excess of most 6 \ndrinking water supplies.  In the UK, however, the effectiveness of uv for Cryptosporidium deactivation is not 7 \nofficially recognised in water quality legislation: a water supplier can still potentially be prosecuted if the 8 \noocyst concentration exceeds 1 per 10 litres (on average) of drinking water sampled, irrespective of whether 9 \nthey have been deactivated or not (DETR, 1999).  Clearly then, managing risks to water safety requires more 10 \nthan the identification of hazards and their control points.  It requires an integrated and complete view of the 11 \nvulnerabilities to the system from catchment to tap. 12 \n 13 \n4. The US Partnership of Safe Water 14 \nAnother significant water safety initiative is the US Partnership of Safe Water.  This is a voluntary 15 \ncooperation formed jointly in 1995 by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the American Water Works 16 \nAssociation and several other drinking water organisations with over 200 surface water treatment works in the 17 \nUS currently participating in the scheme (AWWA, 2005).  The Partnership currently recognises four levels of 18 \naccreditation.  It has evolved separately from HACCP and although it is not intended to be directly analogous, 19 \ndoes have some elements in common with a water safety approach, such as the focus on \u2018performance 20 \nlimiting factors\u2019, which has some similarity to the \u2018preventative measures\u2019 of Nokes and Taylor (2003).  21 \nHowever, unlike other water safety plans, the Partnership is not \u2018risk-based\u2019 in the sense that it does not adopt 22 \nrisk assessment as a starting point for risk management.  WHO (2004) concedes that some elements of a water 23 \nsafety plan will often be implemented as part of drinking water suppliers\u2019 usual practice, but that existing 24 \nsystems may not include tailored hazard identification as a starting point for risk management. It is possible 25 \nthat the Partnership\u2019s code could yet be broadened to incorporate more elements of proactive hazard 26 \nidentification and risk management thereby elevating it to a full water safety approach.  That is not to say that 27 \nthe Partnership does not reduce risks.  Indeed, the system is a proactive optimisation programme that 28 \n12 \nencourages good practice and, if successful in effecting net reductions in turbidity, for example, should lead to 1 \nsignificant lowering of microbial risk at high risk works.  Moreover, the quality assurance provided by the 2 \nPartnership is deemed to be highly credible, having been informed and authenticated by an independent third 3 \nparty group.  Arguably, in a regulated system, it is unlikely that all optimisation programmes will be 4 \ndetermined uniquely through companies\u2019 own risk assessment projects.  Works\u2019 design and operation will 5 \ncontinue to be influenced by new regulatory standards and \u2018good practice\u2019 guides such as that provided by the 6 \nPartnership and other expert groups, reviews and inquiries (e.g. Badenoch, 1990, 1995; Bouchier, 1998).  This 7 \nsuggests that although initiatives such as the Partnership for Safe Water may benefit from a stronger focus on 8 \nrisk, conversely they may also themselves contain elements that would be useful additions to any water 9 \nquality management system. 10 \n 11 \n5. An integrated approach to water safety 12 \nIn order to fully provide \u201cgood, safe drinking water that has the trust of customers\u201d, water 13 \ncompanies need to adopt an integrated approach to managing their supplies, one that not only includes a water 14 \nsafety plan at its core, but that also encompasses a suite of other monitoring, control and other risk assessment 15 \ninitiatives.  One way in which this can be conceptualised is to use the framework proposed in Fig. 2.  Its 16 \npremise is that an effective approach to water quality management is characterized at least by the following 17 \nseven elements: 18 \n\u2022 Risk assessment \u2013 A sensible approach to water safety should proactively and continuously seek out 19 \nthreats to water safety and assess risks in terms of perceived likelihood and consequence.  This 20 \nprocess typically includes activities such as hazard identification and semi-quantitative risk ranking, 21 \nbut could feasibly encompass a range of other analytical tools e.g. complex GIS models 22 \n(MacGillivray et al., 2005). 23 \n\u2022 System controls \u2013 Risks can be reduced or eliminated only by improving the water supply system 24 \nfrom catchment to tap, according to time and cost constraints.  This can include tightening  25 \nmanagement controls (e.g. staff training) as well as operational controls (process design and 26 \noperation) as promoted in Awwa (2005).  27 \n13 \n\u2022 System monitoring \u2013 a key component of water safety is the monitoring (through sample testing and 1 \non-line monitors) of water quality indicators at different stages in the water supply system.  This may 2 \nbe conducted to meet legislative and regulatory requirements or for companies\u2019 own purposes of 3 \ninternal quality control or research.  \u201cMonitoring\u201d can also include qualitative assessments of water 4 \nquality (e.g. taste and odour tests) as well as routine spot checks of equipment, constructions and 5 \nareas (e.g. security checks, reservoir inspections and catchment surveys). 6 \n\u2022 Risk controls \u2013 These refer to control measures undertaken specifically as part of a risk management 7 \nprogramme.   Not all of these can or need to be monitored.  These may include absolute barriers 8 \nwhere the hazard is removed or eliminated. 9 \n\u2022 Risk monitoring - Conversely, not all risks deemed to be significant may be controlled.  These can 10 \ninclude \u2018watched risks\u2019 believed by the supplier to be borderline, or high risks where no adequate 11 \ncontrols currently exist.  The risk monitoring process can be complemented by quantitative 12 \ntechniques (e.g. extreme value probability plotting for microbial pathogens, Ongerth, 1989).  This 13 \ncan be useful as long as the \u2018systems-view\u2019 ethos of water safety plans is not compromised i.e. that 14 \nsuppliers do assume that a supply is safe solely from its monitoring record. 15 \n\u2022 Monitor-based controls \u2013 It is proposed that some of these initiatives (e.g. statistical process control, 16 \nturbidity improvement programmes, works intake protection monitoring) have such an importance 17 \nwithin the field of quality management that they should be considered in their own right, irrespective 18 \nof whether or not they are explicitly \u2018risk-based\u2019 and included within water safety plans. 19 \n\u2022 Barrier validation \u2013 The continuous validation of barrier integrity is a key part of water safety plans.  20 \nThis process can include conventional CCP monitoring as well as qualitative site inspections, for 21 \nexample.  Aspects which arguably should be given greater emphasis in water safety plans are the 22 \nimportance of \u2018bad-days and bypass\u2019 with regard to barrier integrity, the possible interaction between 23 \ncertain controls, and the level of residual risk in the system.  24 \n 25 \nFig. 2. A conceptualisation of different water quality management initiatives and their inter-relationship 26 \n 27 \n14 \nIn terms of water safety plans, the areas within the risk management section of the model are the 1 \nmost relevant.  This is predicated on the basis that it is the proactive and preventative aspects of such an 2 \napproach that are water safety plans\u2019 key features or selling points.  However, other initiatives carried out as 3 \npart of \u2018good practice\u2019 can also play an important in quality management.  The conceptualisation provided can 4 \nbe used as a framework for organising and integrating all these initiatives. 5 \n 6 \n6. Links to other areas of business 7 \nAs with many other utility sectors, water suppliers are increasingly seeking to establish sound risk 8 \ngovernance throughout all levels of the business to safeguard the interests of their customers and investors.  9 \nTo this end, different risk assessment tools and techniques have been developed that facilitate a consistent 10 \napproach to risk management across companies, thereby promoting an \u2018integrated\u2019 approach where risk 11 \ninformation can be read across from one business area to another. 12 \nIn England and Wales, for example, water companies are required to adopt a risk-based approach in 13 \nother areas of regulated business, such as in their obligation to develop and implement \u2018Distribution 14 \nOperation and Maintenance Strategies\u2019 (DOMS) for the proactive management of drinking water distribution 15 \nsystems (Drinking Water Inspectorate, 2002).  A risk analysis approach is also advocated by the financial 16 \nregulator as a means to prioritise future capital maintenance (Office of Water Services, 2002).  Because of the 17 \nsimilarity of the risk scoring systems used in these and other initiatives, it would be sensible for a company to 18 \nstandardize its approach to assessing risk in these areas and, where possible, to encourage \u2018read-across\u2019 19 \nbetween them.  To this end, many companies are now developing their own asset and\/or business risk scoring 20 \nsystems that allow them to prioritise risks to their company.  Leverett (2003) details how Severn Trent Water 21 \n(UK) continuously assesses routine and non-routine tasks in four categories according to their likelihood and 22 \nimpact on water quality, water quantity, health and safety, and the environment.  Those risks considered to be 23 \nsignificant are linked to the company\u2019s risk management database, allowing information to be shared across 24 \nthe company, and a central tracking of risk management actions.  Similarly, Scottish Water have developed an 25 \ninterrelated asset risk and criticality scoring mechanism that assesses the \u2018total business impact\u2019 of asset 26 \nfailures across the company in relation to its core business objectives (Lifton and Smeaton, 2003, 2005).  This 27 \nis in essence a source-to-tap FMECA (Failure Mode and Effects Criticality Analysis) approach, but with the 28 \n15 \naddition of a business impact scoring system that assigns a points\u2019 score to different asset failure scenarios 1 \naccording to criteria such as loss of service, environmental impact, and loss of reputation.  The result is an 2 \nintegrated system that extends across all levels of the business with the same tools used to prioritise capital 3 \ninvestment, plan capital maintenance, as well as develop plant maintenance schedules to minimise the risk of 4 \nelectrical and mechanical failure.  Ultimately, the exact shape and form of water safety plan adopted by water 5 \ncompanies should be designed with these wider risk management practices in mind.  6 \n 7 \n7.  Conclusions 8 \nThe way in which the international water sector manages risk is becoming integrated with other 9 \nbusiness processes and made more explicit.  Risk management is becoming recognised as central to the 10 \nprovision of safe drinking water. 11 \nWater suppliers are increasingly seeking to develop and implement proactive and preventative water 12 \nsafety plans in addition to compliance monitoring regimes to improve water safety. 13 \nHACCP can be a useful tool in establishing and tightening treatment process controls, but most 14 \nmodern water safety plans have typically sought to extend this further and have adopted a wider-ranging, 15 \nmultiple barrier approach, that looks at a broad range of \u2018preventative measures\u2019 for managing risks from 16 \ncatchment to tap. 17 \nThe concepts of bad-days and bypass are important within the field of water safety as is barrier 18 \nindependency.  A different mindset may need to be taken by water companies and regulators alike to ensure 19 \nthat risks are managed in an effective and transparent way. 20 \nOther risk management, optimisation and monitoring initiatives are also important in protecting 21 \nwater supplies.  A framework provided can be used to for organizing these into an integrated system. 22 \nAs the industry moves towards a more integrated approach to managing its risks, the ways in which 23 \nrisk information and strategies are \u2018read across\u2019 to other  business areas e.g. capital investment planning is 24 \nalso becoming increasingly important.  This should also be a prime consideration for companies when 25 \ndeveloping their water safety plans. 26 \n 27 \nAcknowledgements 28 \n16 \nWe are grateful to colleagues with whom we have discussed ideas in this paper, including Professor Steve 1 \nHrudey (University of Alberta), Roland Bradshaw and Brian MacGillivray (Cranfield University) and  2 \nrepresentatives of the Institute for Environmental Science and Research (New Zealand), United Utilities 3 \n(UK), Yorkshire Water (UK) and Water Corporation (Australia).

Factors that may have contributed to the outbreak include the recycling of used filter \nwashwater back to the head of the works. \nLisle and Rose (1995) \nSolo-Gabriele and Neumeister (1996) \nDeininger (2004) \nHrudey and Hrudey (2004) \nGideon, USA 1993 An outbreak of Salmonella is believed to have arisen when droppings from nesting pigeons fell into in an open \nand disused, private water storage tank.  These accumulated droppings are thought to have been washed into the \ndrinking water during a programme of mains flushing.  Around 500 people became ill and 7 elderly people died.    \nDeininger  (2004) \nHrudey and Hrudey (2004) \nSydney, Aus 1998 High concentrations of Cryptosporidium and Giardia (oo)cysts were found in a works\u2019 raw and treated water.  \nNo incidence of disease was reported, although a boil water notice was issued to residents.  The official incident \nreport criticised delays in alerting the public to the potential health risks and recommended a critical examination \nof procedures to communicate these to the public. \nMcClellan (1998) \nHrudey and Hrudey (2004) \nMicrobial \ncontamination of \ndrinking water1 \nWalkerton, Can 2000 Around 2,300 residents were ill and 7 died from drinking water contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 and \nCampylobacter jejuni.  The contamination was traced to the run-off from a local farm which had infiltrated a \nnearby well.  Chlorine residuals were not being maintained with operators failing to carry out simple checks and \nfalsifying records. \nO\u2019Connor et al. (2002) \nDeininger (2004) \nHrudey and Hrudey (2004) \nCamelford, UK 1988 A stand-in delivery tanker driver pumped 20 tons of aluminium sulphate directly into the final chlorine contact \ntank at an unmanned works. \nEnvironmental Data Services (1999) \nBuckley (2004) \nWorcester, UK 1994 Water supplied from a river abstraction works became tainted with low concentrations of a industrial solvent, \nwhich had passed through an upstream sewage treatment works.  This led to taste and odour problems, \ninconveniencing around 110,000 customers over a two-day period.  No illnesses or health risks were believed to \nhave resulted from this incident. \nFurness (2004) \nChemical \ncontamination of \ndrinking water \nGlasgow, UK 1997 Around 200 litres of diesel were spilled during an unmanned fuel transfer to a mobile generator at a water \ntreatment works.  Unbeknownst to the treatment operator, the drain into which this spillage had entered, fed \ndirectly into the works\u2019 washwater recovery system.  The problem lay unrecognised for 24 hours.  The water \nsupply to 60,000 customers was affected and the water deemed unfit to drink for 8 days. \nFraser (1998) \nFawell (2004) \n1 Summaries of microbial disease outbreaks are also presented in Badenoch (1990), Lisle and Rose (1995), Solo-Gabriele and Neumeister (1996), Hrudey et al.
