The rise in obesity and associated risks\nhave become a major public health issue globally [2]. Although\nweight gain is ultimately the result of an overall positive energy\nbalance, the environmental and genetic interplay that accounts for\nthe dramatic rise in obesity is not fully understood. Nutritionally,\nthere have been many significant changes in the profile of\nenergetic nutrients over the last 100 years [3]. By far the largest\nresearch focus has been towards the impact of dietary fat on body\ncomposition. This has ignored not only the decrease in total\ncarbohydrate intake but a change in the quality of carbohydrate\nthat we have consumed over the last century. Recently, interest\nhas been stimulated in understanding the relationship between\ndietary carbohydrate, appetite regulation, body weight and body\ncomposition [4,5]. There is epidemiological evidence supporting\nchanges in carbohydrate consumption have contributed to an\nincrease in obesity [6]. Also, there have been reports of body\ncomposition being affected by carbohydrate type in small animals\n[7]. It would appear that slowly absorbed fermentable carbohy-\ndrate results in lower body fat content with no change in overall\nbody weight [8]. At the present time, the mechanism for these\nobservations is unclear. There is also some provisional evidence\nthat diets high in resistance starch (RS) may have an effect on\nadipocyte metabolism by affecting the release of adiponectin [9].\nThe metabolic impact of RS in humans has recently been\ndemonstrated by Robertson etal [10]. In this study supplementa-\ntion with RS lead to a increase insulin sensitivity and a reduction\nin glycerol and free fatty acids across subcutaneous adipose tissue\n[10]. This is suggestive of a change in adipocyte metabolism that\nmay lead to a change in insulin sensitivity. Also, fermentable\ncarbohydrate such as RS and inulin has been demonstrated to\nincrease the release of gut hormones with roles in appetite\nregulation and possibly, leptin release [9,11].\nSome of the effects of high intakes of RS and fermentable\ncarbohydrate described above such as changes in body compo-\nsition are suggestive of a central role in energy homeostasis. This\nhas been technically difficult to evaluate. In this study, we use\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy (MRS) to determine body composition, not only in\nAcademic Editor: Daniel Tome\u00b4, AgroParisTech, France\nReceived August 10, 2007; Accepted November 12, 2007; Published December\n12, 2007\nCopyright: \u0001 2007 So et al.

We also used a newly\ndeveloped functional imaging method, manganese-enhanced MRI\n(MEMRI), to assess the impact of dietary starches on appetite\ncentres in the hypothalamus [13,14,15]. This novel method allows\nin vivo assessment of brain activity, making it ideal for longitudinal\ndietary studies. Moreover, we have shown that neuronal activity is\nunaffected by the presence of Mn2+ ions in our protocol and that\nthis technique produces similar results to traditional c-Fos\nexpression based methods to detect neuronal activation [14].\nWe hypothesised that mice fed a diet high in RS as a model of\nfermentable dietary fibre would have similar body weights compared\nto those with a low RS intake but have differences in body\ncomposition, metabolic profile and central appetite regulation.\nRESULTS\nBody Weight, Food Intake and Body Composition\nData\nBoth groups of mice maintained for 8 weeks on the LRS and HRS\ndiets had similar body weights throughout the time-course (Fig. 1).\nThis was despite a significantly higher food intake by the HRS group\n(Fig. 2a), reflecting animal adaptation to the energy dilution effect of\nthe RS enriched feed. However, the increase in total weight of food\nconsumed by individual mice in the HRS group did not fully\ncompensate for the more energy dilute feed, this includes estimation\nof the energy recovery from the high resistant starch feed through\nfermentation. In the high HRS the total energy intake remains\nsignificantly lower in the HRS mice (Fig 2b). Assessment of total\npercentage adiposity by whole body 1H MRS, indicated that despite\nsimilar weight gains between the two groups, the weight gained by\nthe LRS group arise from deposition of adipose fat rather than lean\ntissue mass (Fig. 3). By segmentation analysis of whole body MRI\ndata, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue deposits were\ndetermined (Fig. 4) to be higher in the LRS group (P,0.05).\nVisceral adipose tissue deposits were 2.4560.27 g and 1.6460.19 g\nfor LRS and HRS groups (P,0.05), respectively, and subcutaneous\nadipose tissue, 3.7460.37 g and 2.6760.32 g for the LRS and HRS\ngroups (P,0.05), respectively.\nGreater deposition of lipids in hepatocytes were detected in the\nLRS group, relative intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) levels were\n12.461.7 and 4.360.6 for the LRS and HRS groups, respectively\n(P,0.01). No difference in the levels of relative intramyocellular\nlipid (IMCL) were detected between the two dietary groups.\nFigure 1.

The 4th\nventricle is located outside the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and\nsignal enhancement in this area allows for normalisation of the\nenhancement curves for Mn2+ arrival time into the brain. No\nsignificant difference was observed in MEMRI of the 4th ventricle\nbetween the LRS and HRS groups, suggesting Mn2+ uptake into\nthis area outside the BBB to be the same in both groups. Although\nMEMRI in the ARC is greater in the HRS group compared to the\nLRS group, statistical difference was not reached (P,0.2).\nHowever, both the VMH and the PVN show significantly greater\nuptake in the LRS compared to the HRS group (P,0.05),\nindicating greater activation in the former dietary group.\nAdipocyte Data\nAdipocytes isolated from the epididymal fat of LRS mice were\nfound to be of a significantly larger size (7.8960.12 mm) than those\nfrom the HRS mice (6.9160.09 mm, P,0.001). A higher\nborderline insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was observed in the\nisolated adipocytes from the HRS group (273.0650.7 % above\nbaseline adipose tissue) compared to those from the LRS group\n(159.8622.8 % above baseline adipose tissue, P,0.05).\nPlasma Analysis\nTable 1 shows that plasma leptin and adiponectin were\nsignificantly higher in the LRS group compared to the HRS,\ndespite no overall change in body weight. The glucose:insulin\nratio, in the face of normal glycaemia was significantly higher in\nthe HRS group suggesting ingestion of higher amounts of RS led\nto a more insulin-sensitive animal.\nDISCUSSION\nMaintenance for 8 weeks on either the LRS or HRS diets lead to\nsimilar weight gain but differences in whole body adiposity. This is\ndespite the HRS group consuming significantly more total weight\nof food in response to the greater energy dilution in the HRS feed.\nHowever despite this increase in total weight of food the energy\nintake in the animals on the HRS diet was significantly lower than\nthe LRS group. For the animals in both groups to have the same\ntotal body weight would suggest the HRS animal had reduced\nenergy expenditure, although this was not directly measured in this\nstudy. It is known that when animals are pair fed RS enriched\nfeeds [7] there is no change in total body weight but similar\nchanges in body composition as reported in this paper. However,\nit is difficult to unpick if some of the observations made in the\nstudy are due to a reduced energy intake and the metabolic\ncompensation the animal uses to keep its body weight the same as\nthe LRS group, but the vector for the changes is the HRS diet.\nThese observations make the functionalMRI finding, discussed\nbelow, even more surprising.\nSignificant differences in total, subcutaneous and visceral\nadipose tissue was observed, the ingestion of a low RS diet\nleading to significantly greater deposition of adipose tissue. These\nobservations are similar to those of Pawlak et al [7] in which rats\nmaintained on a diet low in RS had significantly greater body fat\nand less lean body mass than those given a high RS diet, despite\nhaving similar mean body weights. We have not only confirmed\nthe findings of others [7] but have added to such observations with\nthe demonstration that the IHCL level is significantly higher in the\nanimals fed a LRS diet. This may be a critically important\nobservation given the mounting evidence to the central role of liver\ntriacylglycerol in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, a\nmechanism which is not really fully understood [16,17]. It is\ninteresting that in this study there is a increase in the\ninsulin:glucose ratio in the LRS group, suggesting an increase in\ninsulin resistance, a similar observation was made by Pawlak et al,\nin which a more comprehensive assessment of insulin and glucose\nmetabolism was made [7]. This would suggest the change in body\ncomposition inducted by the HRS diet (lower percentage total\nbody fat, arising from both lower levels of visceral and\nsubcutaneous fat, and IHCL) has a positive impact on insulin\nand glucose handling.\nWe also observed changes in adipocyte morphology arising\nfrom differences in the diet, adipocytes were significantly larger in\nthe LRS fed animals. There is a well established relationship\nbetween adipocyte size and insulin sensitivity, i.e., the larger the\nadipocytes, the lower their sensitivity to insulin [18]. This has been\nFigure 4. Typical transverse abdominal MRI and associated segmented images of mice on HRS and LRS diets.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0001309.g004\nCarbohydrate and Metabolism\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 December 2007 | Issue 12 | e1309\nclearly demonstrated in weight loss regain experiments [19,20].\nThis is consistent with the significantly lower insulin-stimulated\nglucose uptake rate observed in the adipocytes isolated from\nanimals fed the LRS diet. Our team and others have demonstrated\nthat a reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake directly\nrelates to a reduction in whole body insulin sensitivity [21,22,23].\nThe lower insulin-stimulated glucose uptake together with the\nsignificantly higher insulin:glucose ratio in the LRS group suggests\nthese animals are moving towards a more insulin resistant state.\nPotential mechanisms for the changes in adipocyte size and insulin\nsensitivity are unclear. It is possible a link exists between short\nchain fatty acid production from the fermentation of RS and the\nchange in adipocyte morphology. Recently, it has been reported\nthat the G protein receptor, GPCR43, on adipocytes may play a\nrole in adipocyte differentiation and proliferation [24]. The ligands\nfor these receptors appear to be the short chain fatty acids, acetate\nand propionate, which although not measured in this study, has\nbeen well documented to be produced from fermentation of RS\n[25]. Further, there is recent evidence that activation of GPCR43\nby acetate and propionate causes a decrease in leptin secretion and\nan increase in adipocyte differentiation [26]. The observations\nmade in our study are similar to that by Slama et al who reported\nsignificantly larger adipocyte size and lower insulin-stimulated\nglucose oxidation in rats fed with diets of low fermentable content\n[27]. The same group also reported an increase in fatty acid\nstorage enzymes and lipogenesis in such animals [28]. Taken\ntogether the results support the hypothesis that RS and possibly its\nfermentation in the large bowel may influence adipocyte\nmetabolism.\nAn interesting observation is the significant difference in plasma\nleptin concentrations, with the LRS group having significantly\nhigher levels despite similar body weights. This appears to support\nFigure 5.

Levels\nof adiponectin were also significantly higher in the LRS animals,\nappearing to be at odds with the findings of elevated leptin levels,\nlarger adipocytes and generally higher insulin:glucose ratio\nobserved in these animals. Leptin and adiponectin is known to\nbe inversely regulated in vivo [30], however, this relationship is not\nobserved in vitro [31], suggesting that the inverse relationship\nobserved in vivo is mediated to some extent by indirect\nmechanisms. Huypens [32] hypothesize the inverse relationship\nbetween leptin and adiponecti may operate via a hypothalamic\nmechanism. Evidence for neural regulation include that stimula-\ntion of the adrenal-sympathetic axis by leptin results in potent\ninhibition of adiponectin production and systemic insulin\nsensitivity [33]. Increased central leptin availability rapidly induces\nSOCS-3 expression in adipose tissue [34] and markedly lowers\ncirculating adiponectin levels in normal and ob\/ob mice [35].\nFurther, hypertensive patients exhibiting chronic inhibition of the\nsympathetic drive have increased circulating adiponectin [36]. In\nour study, the paradoxical increase in adiponectin levels\nconcomitant with increased leptin levels observed in the LRS\nmice is consistent with induction of leptin resistance in these mice.\nThis is comparable to the selective hypothalamic leptin resistance\nobserved in mice following gold thioglucose treatment [37]. In\nsuch animals, increased adiponectin production was detected\nduring the early phase of the obesity syndrome induced by gold\nthioglucose [32].\nOur team has recently demonstrated the utility of MEMRI in\nunderstanding changes in appetite regulation in the hypothalamus,\nshowing the sensitivity of this technique to detect predicable\nchanges between fasted and ad libitum fed animals in the\nhypothalamus [15], and changes following hormonal stimulus\n[14]. We have recently published validation of this techniques\nagainst other gold standard methodologies [13]. In our previous\nstudies, increased Mn2+ uptake, i.e., overall increased neuronal\nactivation, was observed in the ARC, PVN and VMN brain areas\nin fasted animals compared to ad libitum fasted animals [14].\nAdministration of oxyntomodulin to fasted animals, led to a\nreduction in Mn2+ uptake in the VMH and PVN areas, resulting\nin a pattern of Mn2+ uptake similar to that observed in ad libitum\nfed animals [14]. In our current study, Mn2+ uptake in the VMH\nand PVN was significantly lower in the HRS animal compared to\nthe LRS animal, reflecting an animal in a more satiated state.\nMEMRI was also generally lower in the ARC, although not\nsignificantly. Thus, using MEMRI we were able to gain an insight\ninto the impact of low and high RS diets on neuronal activation in\nhypothalamic areas with roles in appetite regulation. These data\nare even more surprising considering the lower energy intake in\nthe HRS group. The data suggests that there may be appetite\nregulatory differences between animals exposed to varying\namounts of RS with the LRS animals producing MEMRI data\ncloser to fasted animals and the HRS animals to that of sated\nanimals. This is despite the lower energy intake in the HRS diet. It\nis possible with the demonstrated effect on central appetite\nregulation, that there may be effects on animal behaviour, which\nwe did not measure in this experiment, such as a decrease in\nmovement that would account of the similar body weight. Initially,\nwe had expected the MEMRI pattern of the HRS group to be\ncomparable to the fasted state since these animals exhibited a\ngreater food intake and lower energy intake, i.e., appear to have\nincreased appetite. However, food intake is regulated by nutrient\nsensing hypothalamic neurones with glucoprivic conditions eliciting\nlow ATP concentrations in neuropeptide Y\/agouti-related protein\n(AgRP) neurones resulting in induction of AgRP expression and so,\nincreased food intake [38]. Due to the low glycemic nature of a diet\nin which the carbohydrate component is fulfilled by RS, postprandial\nglucose levels would be relatively lower in animals on the HRS diet\ncompared to those on the LRS diet, explaining the overall increased\nfood intake observed in the former animals: the increased food intake\ncompensating for the low calorific value of the HRS diet. However,\nonce ATP concentrations in AgRP neurones have been restored,\nAgRP expression is inhibited, leading to a cessation of feeding. The\nsimilarity of the MEMRI pattern between the HRS group and\nanimals in the ad libitum fed state suggests that ingestion of significant\namounts of RS leads to an animal predominantly in a satiated state.\nIt is likely the observed effects of the RS starch diet on body\ncomposition and appetite regulation are multifactorial. For\nexample, increasing RS reduces energy density of the diet. The\ninfluence of energy density of the diet on food intake and adiposity\nhas been already demonstrated in other studies both in animal and\nhuman [39]. Increasing RS modifies gastric and intestinal motility\nand increase distal metabolism. These effects could modify the\nrelease of gut hormones involved in the control of food intake [8].\nThe increased distal gut metabolism leads to an increased production\nof short chain fatty acids. It is possible that short chain fatty acids\nhave a role in adipose tissue remodelling and hepatic metabolism\n[40]. Increasing resistant starch also reduces glycemix index which is\nknown to modify insulin\/glucose response a possible mechanism for\nappetite reduction as discussed above [4].\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that a diet rich in RS has a\nsignificant impact on adipose tissue patterning and IHCL\ndeposition. We provide evidence that RS has a significant impact\non glucose and insulin metabolism, mediated by major changes in\nadipocyte morphology and metabolism. MEMRI data suggest that\nRS can significantly influence hypothalamus areas with a major\nrole in appetite regulation. The MEMRI patterning in the HRS\ngroup are similar to those of a satiated animal. This is despite the\nhigher plasma leptin in the lower RS group. This study highlights\nthe need for integrated physiological inquiry to understand the\nmechanisms behind nutrient induced physiological change. If\nthese observations are reflected in humans, then there is the\npotential for major health benefits of including RS as the major\ncarbohydrate in the diet, which may support provisional\nepidemiological evidence of reduced diet related disease in\npopulation who consume high levels of RS.\nTable 1.

We used RS as a model of fermentable dietary fibre.\nWhole body adiposity, intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) and\nintramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content were measured using 1H\nMRI and MRS methods. MEMRI was also used to measure\nhypothalamic neuronal activity in the ad libitum fed state at the end\nof the study period. Body weights and food intake, over the 8 week\nperiod of dietary intervention were also recorded. At the end of the\ninterventional period, adipocytes were isolated from epididymal\nadipose tissue to determine insulin sensitivity and adipocyte size\nAnimals and Treatment\nAll animal studies were performed in accordance with the UK\nAnimals Scientific Procedures Act (1986). Animals were allowed\nad libitum access to drinking water and chow. Animals where\nrandomly assigned to either the high or low RS diet (Harlan,\nBichester., Oxfordshire, UK) table 2. Animals were housed in\ngroups 4 per cage under conditions of controlled temperature (21\u2013\n23uC) and light (12-h light, 12 h dark cycle; lights on at 07:00 h).\nForty male mice (C57BL\/6, 3 weeks old, Harlan UK) were\nobtained and whole body 1H MRS performed (as described below)\nfollowing a 16 h fast. Based on whole body adiposity measure-\nments by MRS and body weight data, mice were allocated into\ngroups of four and housed in individually ventilated cages.\nMice were then maintained for 8 weeks on either a low RS diet\n(LRS, 6 cages of 4 animals) or a high RS diet (HRS, 4 cages of 4\nanimals). The compositions of the LRS and HRS diets were\nnutritionally similar ( 69% carbohydrate, 20% protein and 11% fat\n) except the former contained AMIOCATM starch (53% available\ncarbohydrate of feed by weight) as the carbohydrate component\nwhilst the latter contained Hi-MaizeTM starch (32% non digestible\ncarbohydrate and 21% available carbohydrate of feed by weight).\nIn calculating the energy content of the feed allowance was made\nfor fermentation and recovery of energy from the RS. This had an\nimpact on the energy density of the feed with AMIOCATM\nproviding 15kJ\/g and Hi-MaizeTM providing 10.5 kJ\/g (Table 1).\nThis diet was similar to that used by Pawlak et al [7]\nWhole body MRI was also performed at weeks 4 and 8 post-\ndietary intervention as well as in vivo localised 1H MRS of the liver\nand muscle at the latter time-point for selected weight-matched\nanimals (n = 8 and 11 for HRS and LRS, respectively). Weekly\nbody weights and food intakes were also recorded throughout the\ndietary interventional period.\nAt the end of the interventional period, fasting blood was\nobtained by cardiac puncture from the animals which had been\nassessed by whole body MRI and localized 1H MRS. Blood was\ncollected into lithium heparin tubes prior to centrifugation for\nseparation of plasma. A sample of epididymal fat (white adipose\ntissue) was retained for adipocyte isolation (as described below).\nMagnetic Resonance Studies\nMeasurement of Whole Body Adiposity and Individual\nAdipose Tissue Deposits Anaesthesia was induced and\nmaintained by inhalation of 1\u20132% isoflurane\/oxygen mix.\nFollowing a 16 h fast, whole body 1H MRS spectra, to assess\nwhole body adiposity, were obtained on a Varian Inova 4.7T\nsystem (Varian Inc., CA, USA) with the following parameters:\nrepetition time (TR) 20 s, 45u pulse and 4 averages. The total\npercentage adiposity was calculated as previously described [41].\nWhole body MRI was also performed at the end of the 8-week\ndietary interventional period to determine the amounts of internal\nand subcutaneous fat. A standard spin-echo MRI sequence was\nemployed with TR 2200 ms, echo time (TE) 20 ms, matrix size\n2566192, field of view (FOV) 45645 cm, 2 averages and 50\ncontiguous slices of 2 mm thickness. Segmentation analysis\n(SliceOmaticTM, TomovisionH, Canada) was performed blindly\nby the observer on whole body MRI data sets from selected\nweight-matched animals (n = 8 per dietary group) to determine\nlevels of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue.\nMeasurement of Intra-Hepatocellular (IHCL) and Intra\u2013\nMyocellular (IMCL) Lipid Levels Localised 1H MRS of the\nliver and muscle was performed at the end of the 8-week\ninterventional period to assess intracellular lipid levels. Placement\nof a 36363 mm voxel in the organs was guided by pilot MRI\nTable 2.

Using a PRESS sequence with parameters: TR, 10 s; TE,\n9 ms and 64 averages, localised 1H MRS from the voxels were\ncollected. Relative IHCL and IMCL levels were calculated as\npreviously described [42].\nHypothalmic Neuronal Manganese-Enhanced MRI\nMEMRI scans were performed on ad libitum 4 animals (weight\nmatched) from each dietary group as previously described on a\nVarian Inova 9.4T scanner (16). Briefly, spin-echo multi-slice T1-\nweighted imaging was performed with the following scanning\nparameters: TR 600 ms; TE 10 ms, matrix size = 2566192, FOV\n25 mm625 mm and 1 transient, before and at various times after\nintravenous (IV) infusion of manganese chloride (62.3 mM, 5 ml\/g\nMnCl2.4H2O, Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, U. K.). Each scan yielded\nten contiguous transverse slices of 1 mm thickness with ,100 mm\nresolution, taking a total scan time of 1 min 57 s. The slice offset\nfor each mouse was aligned to identifiable anatomical features (the\n4th ventricle and the anterior pituitary gland) with reference to a\nstandard mouse brain atlas [43] to ensure brains were in register\nfor all mice.\nPrimary Adipocyte Studies\nThe isolation of adipocytes from epididymal adipose tissue has\nbeen described in detail elsewhere [44] and will only be detailed\nbriefly here. The samples were collected into Dulbecco\u2019s Modified\nEagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) containing 5% bovine\nserum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich). The epididymal adipose\ntissue samples were finely minced and DMEM, supplemented with\n5% BSA and collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) were added. The tissue\nsuspensions were placed in a vibrating water bath at 40 cycles\/\nminute (45 mins, 37uC). After incubation, cell suspensions were\nthen filtered through a 400 nm mesh and washed 3 times in a\nglucose-free Krebs-Ringer phosphate (KRP) buffer with 5% BSA\n(each wash involving 5 inversions). At no time were the adipocytes\nleft to stand for more than 5 mins without being agitated. In vitro\nstudies (see below) were then performed on approximately 30,000\nisolated adipocytes. Cells were kept suspended throughout in a\nvibrating water bath.\nMeasurement of Adipocyte Size Following adipocyte\nisolation, an aliquot of the cell suspension was observed by\noptical microscopy with a graticle placed over one objective lens.\nThe cells were manually counted in a 1:100 dilution of the cell\nconcentrate by means of a haemocytometer (with a 200 mm gap)\nand the size measured using the graticle scale.\nMeasurement of Adipocyte Insulin-stimulated Glucose\nUptake This has been described in detail elsewhere [21,44].\nThe adipocytes were initially incubated (45 minutes, 37uC) in\n500 mL of KRP with 5% BSA in the presence of 1 nM insulin\n(Sigma-Aldrich) before the addition of 300 nM of a non-\nmetabolizable radiolabeled glucose analogue (0.1 mCi C-14 2-\ndeoxy-D-glucose). They were then incubated for a further\n15 minutes before centrifugation through 500 mL of silicone oil.\nGlucose uptake was calculated following liquid scintillation\ncounting of the radiolabeled glucose analogue tracer in the\nisolated adipocytes.\nMeasurement of Plasma Parameters\nPlasma from fasted mice was taken for measurement of hormones\nand selected adipokines using fluorescent bead based assays\naccording to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Leptin, resistin, insulin,\ntotal plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (tPAI-1), interleukin-6 (IL-\n6), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were measured\nusing a multiplex kit and adiponectin, a single plex kit (Linco\nResearch, St. Charles, MO, USA) on a Luminex system (Austin,\nTexas, USA). Plasma glucose was measured using a One Touch\nUltra meter and test strips (Milpitas, CA, USA).\nStatistical Analysis\nValues are quoted as mean6standard error of mean (SEM).\nSignificant differences between measured parameters from the\nHRS and LRS groups were tested using either the Student\u2019s t-test\nor Mann-Whitney test, except for measurements of percentage\nadiposity, food intake and body weight which was tested for\nsignificance using the two way ANOVA with Bonferonni post-\ntesting. MEMRI data obtained from the two dietary groups was\ntested for significance by repeated measures ANOVA. Significance\nwas taken as P,0.05\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: JB GF WY YK CW AG PS.\nPerformed the experiments: JB GF WY YK CW AG PS.
