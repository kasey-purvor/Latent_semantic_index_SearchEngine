This article explores one element of this\nrelationship, namely the ways in which Africans reacted to Indian indentured workers. It looks\nbriefly at the conditions of indenture, and dwells at greater length on Indians\u2019 experiences as small\nagricultural producers after their contracts of indenture had ended. The attitudes of African tradition-\nalists and the new middle class are examined. The article ends by examining the relationship\nbetween the leading political leaders of Indians and Africans in early twentieth-century Natal, M.\nK. Gandhi and John Dube. It suggests that while the settler state had an interest in driving a wedge\nbetween Africans and Indians, such sentiments for separation were felt from below as well.\nIntroduction\nFrom 1860 to 1911, Indian workers entered the Colony of Natal in southeast Africa\nunder a system of indenture, jointly organised by the British rulers of both India and\nNatal and white employers of labour in Natal. This article examines the reception\nof these Indian workers by the indigenous African majority of Natal, and some of\nthe consequences for later political organisation among oppressed groups. The central\nargument offered is that racialised access to jobs and especially land resulted in a discourse\nthat reduced highly complex social groups to two apparently homogenous (and\nfrequently opposed) racial categories, \u2018Africans\u2019 and \u2018Indians\u2019. Further, it is argued that\nthe separation between them was not only the result of familiar \u2018divide and rule\u2019 tactics\nfrom above; those down below also had a hand in its creation.2\nIt must be noted that there already exists a substantial literature on Indian immigrants\u2019\nexperiences in South Africa. Important work has been conducted on virtually every\naspect of indenture and after: analyses of passenger lists, labour conditions, the recreation\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) T\nhe\n S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nthe\n S\ntud\ny o\nf L\nab\nou\nr H\nist\nory\n156 Heather Hughes\nof family and social life, the growth of political and labour organisation, the role of\nwealthier \u2018passengers\u2019 who travelled voluntarily to South Africa (and a great deal of\nattention has been paid to the most famous of these by far, M. K. Gandhi, who lived in\nSouth Africa from 1893 to 1914) and the (re-) emergence of a sense of \u2018Indianness\u2019 in\nSouth Africa.3\nHowever, gaps remain. For a long time, the political context weighed heavily on\nscholarship. For instance, E. S. Reddy pointed out that apartheid more or less precluded\nany research by scholars from mainland India, a matter that is now being redressed.4\nAgain, other writings on South African history, including revisionist ones, tended to\npartition their subject matter along racial lines. (Such a mosaic approach to the\ncharacterisation of ethnic difference would not surprise scholars of ethnicity in the USA,\nfor example.) Thus, two major works were published on the social history of the popular\nclasses in Durban in the mid-1990s: one was on Indians, one on Africans. 5 In his study,\nFreund wrote that \u2018Indians, as I have come to realise, have a perspective on South\nAfrican society that is different from that of either whites or Africans\u2019.6 Yet such a\nperspective, it could be further argued, has been formed out of the multiple interactions\nbetween Africans and Indians, sometimes shaped by them, sometimes by the not-so-\nhidden hand of white settler domination. That kind of racial separation has tended\nto militate against a full appreciation of the variety of connections between these two\ndifferentiated groups. The key point here is that apart from moments of extreme racial\ntension, such as erupted in 1949 and 19857, there has been little published on everyday\nrelations between Africans and Indians. Bhana and Vahed\u2019s recent study has begun\nto address this neglected area; indeed, their first chapter is pointedly entitled \u2018Gandhi,\nAfricans and Indians in colonial Natal\u20198. This study follows their work as an attempt to\nshed light on the nature and results of interaction between Africans and Indians during\nthat historical phase.\nFirst, an outline of Indian immigration and conditions of indenture is presented. This\nis followed by an account of Indians\u2019 experiences as agricultural producers in Natal, since\nit was here that the main challenge to Africans\u2019 security was perceived to lie, rather than\nin the urban milieu, which remained very small for the colonial period. Finally, an analy-\nsis of the sources of anti-Indian thinking among Africans, and how this translated into\norganised political activity, is presented. Here, the key figure of John Dube, the Natal-\nbased first president of the African National Congress (ANC), is used to exemplify the\ncentral themes.\nIndian indentured labour and the Natal sugar economy\nEver since the 1840s when Britain extended its control over Natal, white settlers \u2014 like\nwhite settlers everywhere \u2014 had been anxious to discover some crop that would make\nthem and the colony rich. After several failed experiments, including arrowroot, tea,\ncoffee, cotton and sesame seed, sugar seemed to hold the greatest prospect. Ideally suited\nto the subtropical coastal belt on the southeastern coast of Africa, this natural sweetener\nwould become Natal\u2019s \u2018green gold\u2019. The planters faced major difficulties in achieving\ntheir own take-off, however, of which the paucity of indigenous labour was the most\npressing. The approximately 350 000 Africans residing in the Colony in the mid-19th\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) T\nhe\n S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nthe\n S\ntud\ny o\nf L\nab\nou\nr H\nist\nory\n157African Reactions to Indian Immigration\ncentury still had enough access to land not to be tempted by the wages or type of work\nin sugar. Roughly half of them lived in the so-called locations, large tracts of generally\npoor quality land that had been set aside for exclusively African habitation in 1847. Since\nthese were never adequate for all Africans\u2019 needs, the rest lived on private farms that had\nbeen abandoned to speculators after the various collapsed schemes.9 Not all planters faced\na labour drought, but those who did managed to persuade the colonial government to\norganise the importation of bonded labour from another British possession, India. The\nfirst Indian workers arrived in 1860; by the time the scheme ended half a century later,\nsome 152 000 would have disembarked in Natal. They were joined by so-called \u2018passen-\nger\u2019 Indians, better-off traders and professionals mostly from present-day Gujarat and\nlargely Muslim, who came to Natal on their own account to supply the needs of their\nlabouring compatriots.\nIndian workers were indentured for an initial period of five years. Indenture essentially\nmeant that workers were contracted to a single employer, wages were fixed (usually ten\nshillings per month for men and five for women, with an increase of one shilling\nper year) and working and living conditions were entirely at the discretion of the\nemployer.10 Over the period of the scheme, two-thirds of immigrants came from\nTamil- and Telugu-speaking areas of southern India, with the remaining third from\nHindi-speaking districts in the Ganges valley. Twelve per cent of the total numbers of\nimmigrants were Muslim, two per cent were Christian and the remainder were Hindu.\nA wide variety of castes was represented in their number, but most workers were from\nlower castes associated with agricultural pursuits. Two-thirds of the migrants were male.\nMany were, as Swan put it, distressed, despairing, diseased and even disabled; even then,\nleaving India was often a last resort in the battle against harsh environmental conditions\nand demanding overlords.11 Initially, all workers were assigned to sugar production,\nand over the entire period, about sixty per cent were employed in this sector, with the\nremainder being allocated to municipal, railway, mining and commercial employers.\nDespite the diversity in language, religion, experiences of migration and employment,\nall these workers of Indian origin came to be treated in Natal as a homogenous,\nsubordinated category: \u2018coolies\u2019. 12 Indians\u2019 place, in both geographical and social senses,\ncontinued to be very closely tied to their original reason for arrival and was also confined\nby subsequent discriminatory legislation. As one writer put it, \u2018the concept of an\n\u201cIndian\u201d group is almost entirely the product of discriminatory treatment and legislation\nthat lumps all descendants of immigrants from India into one \u201cracial\u201d category.\u201913 The\ncolonial authorities and white settlers found this convenient to their interests, especially\nafter the granting of Responsible Government in 1893 strengthened the hand of the local\nplanter class. The designation implied both servility and isolation. But many African\npeople too, found such a designation convenient, though for rather different reasons.\nLiving and working conditions for the majority of indentured workers were poor\nin the extreme. On the plantations, \u2018overwork, malnourishment and squalid living\nconditions formed the pattern of daily life\u2019 for most workers. Supervision of work\nregimes by overseers was harsh and workers\u2019 movement severely proscribed. Organised\nprotest among them was impossible, so that resistance was largely expressed in forms that\nincluded \u2018malingering, absenteeism, petty larceny, destruction of employers\u2019 property and\ndesertion\u2019.14 In the early 1870s, the Indian government halted emigration because of the\ncritical reports taken home by returning migrants, and only resumed the scheme after\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) T\nhe\n S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nthe\n S\ntud\ny o\nf L\nab\nou\nr H\nist\nory\n158 Heather Hughes\nrenewed assurances by the Natal government that workers\u2019 treatment would be\nimproved. Despite the institution of a new administrative post of Protector of Indian\nImmigrants, there was little that the authorities could or would do to insist upon such\nimprovements.\nBoth Africans and Indians were employed on some plantations. Bhana and Vahed note\nthat there is still a lack of research on how they interacted, though they speculate that\nfriction was more likely to characterise relations than co-operation. They found a few\ncases of Africans employed as sirdars (overseers) in control of Indian workers, and cite\ninstances of African maltreatment of Indian workers, but it is impossible to know how\nrepresentative, or otherwise, this picture was.15\nSugar production was confined to a relatively narrow coastal strip of Natal as well as\nto the extent of the railway line south and north of Durban (a matter of some thirty\nmiles in each direction until the 1880s). The Division of Inanda, to the north of Durban,\nwas the centre of the sugar industry. The fastest rate of increase in production in the\nDivision occurred between 1864 and 1874, as the number of acres under cultivation\nrose from nearly 5 000 to over 12 000, prompting the local district surgeon, Josiah\nMatthews, to declare Inanda to be \u2018[t]he most enterprising and rising portion of the\nwhole colony\u2019.16 Sugar was by no means immune from depression and internal crisis,\nthough, and many smaller planters-cum-millers drifted away to Australia or the\nKimberley diamond fields as the industrial processes of sugar production were centralised\ncomparatively early. The two largest mills in the colony were also located in Inanda, the\nNatal Central Sugar Company at Mount Edgecombe, and Tongaat.17 Sugar production\nrecovered and expanded in the 1880s and the resulting large number of estates in Inanda\nmeant that the Indian population was higher here than in other divisions: by the late\n1880s, there were an estimated 14 000, of whom 6 000 were under indenture and 8 000\nwere \u2018free\u2019.18\nIndians as market gardeners\nAfter five years of indenture, workers could opt to return to India (which about a quarter\ndid), re-indenture, or find work on their own account. Most in this last category either\nsought employment in towns or took to small-scale commercial farming, better known\nlocally as market gardening. Most stayed in Natal, some drifted to the goldfields, all were\nprohibited from entry into the Orange Free State. There were periods of deep economic\ndepression when significant numbers, having been \u2018free\u2019 for some time, contracted them-\nselves back into indenture as a relief from the onerous taxes that came to be imposed on\nIndians.19 The Natal government\u2019s initial promise that the cost of the return passage\ncould be exchanged for a small plot of land was soon abandoned; only fifty out of over\n13 000 applications were ever granted. From their earliest entry into non-indentured\neconomic activity, therefore, Indian agriculturalists lacked a safety net such as a location;\ninstead they had to compete on the open market for access to land.20\nAt first, Indians rented land as close as they could to the markets for their produce.\nEven in Inanda, there was a certain amount available for this purpose, especially to the\ninterior in the so-called mist belt, close to the large African location of the same name.\nConditions in the area were unsuitable for the cane varieties then available and were in\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) T\nhe\n S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nthe\n S\ntud\ny o\nf L\nab\nou\nr H\nist\nory\n159African Reactions to Indian Immigration\nany case poorly served by roads. All this marginal farmland was in the hands of white\nowners, corporate and individual, absentee and local. Numbers of African tenants,\nbetween 4 000 and 5 000 up until the 1890s, were farming such land, largely according\nto traditionalist\/communal practices. No sooner had the initial period of indenture\ncome to an end than they began to face competition. As early as 1866, large parts of\nsome farms in Inanda, such as Riet Rivier and Groeneberg, were leased to small-scale\nIndian growers.21\nThey rapidly emerged as the most reliable food producers in many coastal divisions of\nNatal, particularly Inanda, where they \u2018were the main producers of all crops other than\nsugar.\u201922 The magistrate reported in 1876 that Indians were \u2018the real agriculturalists of this\nDivision .. . But for them, maize would be at famine price, and vegetables would be\nstrangers to our table.\u201923 It was not long before most white landowners considered Indian\ntenants more desirable than African ones. One Inanda-based landlord voiced what by the\n1880s had become a common refrain, \u2018I can get my rent from a Coolie, whereas I find\ngreat difficulty in getting it from a Native.\u201924 By the 1890s, G. H. Hulett, a solicitor in\nVerulam, the administrative centre of the Inanda Division, estimated that a full ninety\nper cent of civil cases in the Inanda magistrate\u2019s court were actions for the recovery of\nrent arrears from African tenants, an indication of the extent to which they were losing\nthe struggle to maintain their foothold on private land.25\nFreund has argued that the vigour of Indian agriculturalists\u2019 enterprise was due to the\nefforts they made in the years immediately after indenture to recreate social, cultural and\nfamilial life of a particular \u2018creolised variety\u2019, suited to the intense self-exploitation to\nwhich extended families seemed prepared to submit themselves: there were even stories\nof them working their gardens by moonlight.26 Many engaged in related activities, such\nas hawking or trading, to the same end. The success of Indian small growers should not\nbe overestimated \u2014 most \u2018remained extremely poor and found less and less opportunity\nto advance their fortunes\u2019.27 Yet there are two other possible reasons for the achieve-\nments of Indian small-scale farmers. One of these Africans themselves well recognised:\nthe \u2018strangers\u2019 from abroad possessed no cattle. More than any other, it was this single\nfactor that marked Indians as impossible to assimilate, as far as Africans were concerned.\n\u2018Three Coolies could live in space that one Kafir would want. Natives like cattle; Coolies\ndo not\u2019, observed Jacobus Matiwane of Verulam. This meant they could use virtually all\nthe land they rented for cultivation.28 Indeed, some landowners complained that Indian\nland use was very harsh on the soil for this very reason. Some African chiefs believed that\nthis was why Indians always had food, even in lean periods, and could \u2018plunder\u2019 Africans\nwho had nowhere else to buy when food was scarce.29\nThe other factor giving Indian growers a possible advantage was the nature of rent\ncharged.30 In Inanda, and probably elsewhere on the coast, Indians were charged per\nacre, whereas Africans were charged per hut. It was customary to charge Africans an\nannually increasing amount per hut; Indians on the other hand were charged fifteen\nshillings to \u00a31 per acre for a fixed number of years.31 The acre rent could well have\nbeen the more favourable arrangement, since it did not matter how many people assisted\nin production, whereas this factor materially affected the amount Africans had to pay to\nthe landowner: the more hands on the land, the more huts were required for them.\nMoreover, on much speculatively held land, Indians, like white tenants, leased acreage\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) T\nhe\n S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nthe\n S\ntud\ny o\nf L\nab\nou\nr H\nist\nory\n160 Heather Hughes\nfor specified periods, whereas Africans \u2018continued to pay per hut without any security of\ntenure\u2019.32\nSome Indian growers were able to purchase small plots, thus giving them a security\nthat their African counterparts lacked, although this frequently involved them in usurious\nborrowing relationships with urban-based \u2018passengers\u2019. The few who emerged as large-\nscale commercial farmers produced cash crops like sugar and tobacco and employed both\nAfrican and Indian labour.33 From the late 1890s, there were extensive purchases of land\nof a different sort \u2014 not by time-expired Indian workers, but by town-based \u2018passenger\u2019\nmerchants, who, suffering from restrictive legislation on land ownership in urban areas,\nbegan to turn to farmland for investment. While waiting for property values to rise, they\ndid what speculators before them had done, dividing their holdings into small parcels for\nrental to petty producers. Indian purchases were significant enough by the turn of the\ncentury to have a marked effect on land prices: in the north of Inanda division, \u2018before\nIndians began to buy, land was as low as \u00a31 to 30s an acre, and now the average price\nis from \u00a34 to \u00a35 an acre\u2019, according to G. H. Hulett.34\nAfrican responses to Indian farmers\nBy the later part of the century, Indian producers seemed well entrenched in small-scale\nagricultural production on their own account, supplying the colony\u2019s towns with fresh\nproduce, while African land hunger seemed to be worsening. African cultivators widely\nperceived a direct connection between these two trends, especially in areas with high\nIndian populations like Inanda. Examples abound: a local homestead head, Matyonovana,\napplied to remove to Zululand on the grounds that \u2018this place is overrun by coolies\u2019.35\nOne induna (chiefly functionary) said Africans were troubled by being \u2018always in a state\nof scarcity owing to the land having been taken up so much by Indians ... the better\nlands had been taken possession of by Indians, and Natives had been given the worst land\nin the district.\u2019 A headman asked, \u2018how was it that the Indians, who were comparatively\nnew arrivals, had been well provided with land, and the natives, who were the\naboriginals of the country, had been turned off?\u2019 Yet another complained that \u2018they felt\nit very much when told to quit and leave their fathers\u2019 bones to be ploughed up by an\nIndian\u2019.36\nTo a degree, anti-Indian feelings among traditionalist Africans arose out of what\nmay be called their different \u2018cultures of production\u2019. However, this difference was com-\npounded by discriminatory practices and attitudes on the part of white landowners and\nofficials. The rental practices of landowners have already been described; Africans were\nalso keenly aware of the different laws and taxes that applied to Indians and themselves.\nAs one Mkontshwana put it, \u2018Europeans loathed the Natives, whereas Natives thought\nmuch of the Europeans, and yet the latter even went to the length of putting the Coolie\nabove the Native.\u201937\nAlso contributing in large measure was a predisposition on the part of many whites\nwho worked closely with Africans to protect \u2018their\u2019 charges. On his patrols, the Inanda\nLocation Supervisor, Thomas Fayle, frequently admonished Africans over their crop-\nplanting methods, telling them that \u2018the Government did not see why they should be\nbeaten by the Coolies\u2019. He persuaded them to plant their own tobacco, \u2018and thereby save\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) T\nhe\n S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nthe\n S\ntud\ny o\nf L\nab\nou\nr H\nist\nory\n161African Reactions to Indian Immigration\nwhat they pay to Coolies\u2019; he urged the women to earn more for their fowls by taking\nthem to Durban themselves, rather than selling to Indians who came around. He encour-\naged all and sundry by telling them \u2018that good Natives were employed in preference\nto Coolies in many places\u2019.38 These were common themes in his conversations with\npeople as he passed from garden to garden. In addition, the original purpose for Indian\nworkers\u2019 entry into Natal left its residue of prejudice: \u2018to Africans and whites alike, the\nterm \u201clabourer\u201d became synonymous with \u201ccoolie\u201d, and stood for a condition to be\navoided\u2019.39\nAfricans and whites alike found it convenient to blame Indians for all manner of social\nills. A common example was the problem of drunkenness among Africans, especially\n(again) in the sugar districts, since sugar by-products were used to make various intoxi-\ncating brews. Treacle was the basic ingredient of the potent isitshimiyana, for example.\nWhile whites and Indians had free access to such types of liquor, there was complete\nprohibition for Africans: some of the most carefully exact definitions of the term\n\u2018Native\u2019 are to be found in colonial liquor legislation.40 There was a thriving illicit trade\nwith Africans in items such as treacle and rum through the \u2018canteens\u2019 (eating houses\nfor Africans), run by both whites and Indians. Yet Africans thought Indians particularly\nculpable: \u2018The Coolies\u2026have become the feet of the Natives in getting grog, and that is\ncausing our nation to die. They are also great thieves. They did not introduce theft, but\nthey have greatly increased it.\u201941\nAnother group of Africans who felt threatened by what they perceived as Indian\nsuccess in agriculture were landowners on the mission stations.42 They had agitated for\nyears to be able to purchase lots on the mission reserves \u2014 those tracts of land attached\nto mission stations that were under jurisdiction of the mission society, but which tended\nalready to have populations of traditionalists on them. There had been a few experiments\nof this kind, but most were on a very small scale. The most notable example of the\nestablishment of an African freehold community was Edendale, near Pietermaritzburg,\nwhere Africans pooled their resources with a Wesleyan missionary to buy a farm, which\nwas then subdivided into individual plots. Generally speaking, Africans wishing to\npurchase land had to do so in competition with everyone else; there was as yet no\nlegislative bar on who could buy. By the late 1870s, Africans owned some 83 000 acres\nin the colony.43 Thereafter, it became increasingly difficult as land prices increased\nrapidly, due to the expansion of sugar and other settler crops and, as noted earlier, to\npurchases by \u2018passenger\u2019 Indians.\nIn order to understand the attitudes of converts, the mission societies themselves need\nto be investigated, since a strong strand of anti-Indian prejudice can be traced to them.\nThe foremost mission society in Natal was the American Zulu Mission (AZM), the local\n\u2018branch\u2019 of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, (ABCFM), with\nits headquarters in Boston. It had been active in the region since the 1840s; the emer-\ngence of an educated African middle class was almost entirely due to its efforts.44 The\ntwo most successful stations of the AZM happened to be sited very close to areas of\nintense sugar production: Amanzimtoti on the south coast, and in Inanda, on the borders\nof the location. In both of these places, it is not hard to find examples of anti-Indian\nsentiment. Rev. Herbert Goodenough, the missionary in charge of Amanzimtoti from\n1881 and who became chairman of all the ABCFM\u2019s operations in southern Africa in the\nearly 1900s, voiced strong objections to land alienation on mission holdings, for fear that\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) T\nhe\n S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nthe\n S\ntud\ny o\nf L\nab\nou\nr H\nist\nory\n162 Heather Hughes\nIndians would end up sub-leasing plots from Africans who had been given titles: this had\nalready occurred on one of the few stations where individual titles had been tried,\nUmvoti.45\nPerhaps the strongest anti-Indianism of all, however, was to be found at the Inanda\nmission station. The missionary in charge there from the 1840s to the 1870s was Daniel\nLindley, in many ways more liberal and tolerant than his missionary peers. A product\nof American Midwest religious revivalism, he was an anti-slavery republican, deeply\ncommitted to the upliftment of his African \u2018parishioners\u2019. Yet on the issue of Indian\nimmigration, he was less than liberal and tolerant: \u2018the great majority of these imported\nlabourers will never return to their native land ... they are indescribably wicked, and\nseem to me hopelessly lost, now and forever .. . I look upon these Indians as a growing\ncloud on our social horizon.\u201946 Other Inanda missionaries felt similarly. Mary Edwards,\nthe head of Inanda Seminary, the premier institution for the education of African girls\nfrom the late 1860s, went to great lengths to buy a large piece of land adjoining the\nschool with her own money, in order to forestall the construction of barracks for Indian\nworkers anywhere in the vicinity.47\nSince they imbibed much else of the missionaries\u2019 world view and embraced it as their\nown, it may be fair to assume that such prejudice was passed on to the early generations\nof African converts. It is an assumption that is almost impossible to prove, because these\nvery early converts left no written clues. However, it is surely more than coincidence\nthat two members of the founding church at Inanda, James Dube and Patayi Mhlongo,\nwere the fathers of the two most prominent African leaders in Natal in the first decades\nof the twentieth century, John Dube and A. W. G. Champion; both sons held pro-\nnounced anti-Indian views.48 There were intense political differences between them.\nDube was always deeply conscious of status, the need for elite leadership, and for\ncampaign tactics that were explicitly constitutional. Champion, as Natal leader of the\nIndustrial and Commercial Workers Union (ICU), was far more willing to take a radical\npopulist approach in order to appeal to workers.49 Yet there were also notable similari-\nties: both were prospective landowners, and their African constituencies likewise faced\ncompetition of various kinds from Indians, whether as small growers or as field or urban\nworkers. Champion\u2019s vociferous anti-Indianism is well known;50 Dube\u2019s, on the other\nhand, while sometimes noted, has been passed over as of little significance.\nJohn Dube\u2019s attitude to Indians\nJohn Langalibalele Dube51 was born at Inanda mission station in 1871. He schooled both\nlocally and at Amanzimtoti, where the boys\u2019 seminary was located. He was among the\nfirst Africans from Natal to attend college abroad, at Oberlin in Ohio from 1887\u20131891.\nHis health failed, however, and he travelled home, where the AZM found him a preach-\ning post. He soon returned to the United States and was ordained at Union Theological\nSeminary in 1899. He became pastor of the Inanda church, as his father had been\nbefore him. With a generous donation of land from the local African chief, Mqhawe, to\nwhom he was closely related, he was able to realise his dream of establishing Ohlange, an\nindustrial school to teach self-sufficiency, at Inanda in 1901. In 1903, he founded the\nnewspaper Ilanga lase Natal, which became an important mouthpiece for the African\nmiddle class.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) T\nhe\n S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nthe\n S\ntud\ny o\nf L\nab\nou\nr H\nist\nory\n163African Reactions to Indian Immigration\nDube came to wider prominence at the time of the so-called Bambatha rebellion in\n1906 \u2014 an armed uprising by African peasants against a new tax being imposed by the\ncolonial state. He criticised the way the authorities handled the crisis, and sympathised\nwith the aspirations of the resisters, although he decried their tactics.52 Dube thereafter\nbecame the leading representative of African converts in Natal and was active in associa-\ntions campaigning for greater rights for them. He rose to the height of his power in 1912\nwhen he was chosen as the first president of the ANC. After he lost the position in 1917\nover accusations about his attitudes to segregation, he became increasingly involved in\nregional Natal politics, participating in the founding of the Zulu ethnic nationalist\norganisation, Inkatha. He authored what is considered the first \u2018modern\u2019 novel in Zulu,\nInsila kaShaka, and a biography of the Nazarite church leader, Isaiah Shembe.53 He also\nwrote extensively on education and Christianity. He was the first African to be awarded\nan Honorary PhD by a South African university (by the University of South Africa in\n1936). He died in 1946.\nAlmost from the first issue of Ilanga, Dube made regular pronouncements about\nIndians (and allowed others to do the same). An item headed \u2018The Indian invasion\u2019 noted\nthat \u2018we know by sad experience how beneath our very eyes our children\u2019s bread is\ntaken by these Asiatics: how whatever little earnings we derive from Europeans, go to\nswell the purses of these strangers, with whom we seem obliged to trade ...\u201954 Resent-\nment was never far beneath the surface: \u2018we had land, we mortgaged the same, and now\nwhat once was our heritage is enjoyed by Indians.\u201955 Many educated Africans believed\nthat Indians were more hard-working than Africans. It was Jacobus Matiwane who\nobserved, \u2018As a people, the Natives are not industrious like the Coolies: as a people we\nare not fond of work.\u2019 That was why it seemed to him that \u2018the coolies will elbow us out\nof the country\u2019.56 It was a sentiment expressed many times in Ilanga.\nThe threat of losing access to land was a theme that Dube often voiced in other\nforums, such as to Commissions and in public speeches. \u2018Natal, to-day, was full of Indi-\nans who had usurped the positions which ought to be filled by the natives ... if the\npolicy of the Government was continued, by which they introduced Indians in large\nnumbers year by year, it was evident the aboriginal natives of Natal would go to the\nwall\u2019, he told the 1906\u20137 Commission.57 Later, in 1912, when attempting to persuade a\nlarge gathering of chiefs in Zululand to support the ANC, he pointed out to them that\n\u2018people like coolies have come to our land and lorded it over us, as though we, who\nbelong to the country, were mere nonentities\u2019.58 Dube was a powerful and effective\norator who sometimes exaggerated for effect, but the underlying message was clear.\nMany writers have been fascinated by the extraordinarily close parallels between\nDube\u2019s Ohlange school complex and Gandhi\u2019s first ashram at Phoenix, barely a mile\naway. Both were established at the start of the twentieth century as places of moral\nenrichment, learning and upliftment; both leaders saw the importance of the press in\ndisseminating their ideas (Gandhi founded his Indian Opinion in the same year as Ilanga,\n1903, and they shared a printing press until Dube could afford his own); both were\ninvolved in what were then elitist political organisations, the Natal Native Congress\n(NNC) and the Natal Indian Congress (NIC), founded to defend the achievements\nof their members. Both leaders also aspired to speak for a far broader constituency of\nordinary people, though strictly defined in racial terms.59\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) T\nhe\n S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nthe\n S\ntud\ny o\nf L\nab\nou\nr H\nist\nory\n164 Heather Hughes\nThough each had his own separate sources of inspiration, they shared at least one: the\npre-eminent black American leader of the time, Booker T. Washington. Dube (who\nhimself came to be dubbed the \u2018Booker T. Washington of South Africa\u2019) had long been\nimpressed by Washington\u2019s gradualist approach to blacks\u2019 acceptance into civil society in\nAmerica, had visited Washington\u2019s school at Tuskegee, Alabama, and had sought his\nendorsement for Ohlange (this would later be forthcoming, in 1911). According to E. S.\nReddy, Gandhi too admired Washington.60 Interestingly, Washington had risen very\nrapidly to national and international attention just a few years earlier as a result of his\nso-called \u2018Atlanta Compromise\u2019 speech, which expressed support for segregation in the\nfamous words, \u2018in all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet\none as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress\u2019.61\nThere was another locally powerful individual that they both turned to for support and\nguidance, \u2018a good friend to the Indians and natives, who called him their father\u2019.62 He\nwas Marshall Campbell, one of the wealthiest and most influential sugar barons, control-\nling the vast Natal Estates as well as successfully promoting Natal sugar interests through\nhis political career as Member of Legislative Assembly in Natal from 1893, and later as a\nUnion Senator. Although Campbell believed they should never have been brought to\nNatal, he did employ Indians on his estates in Inanda when he entered the sugar business\nin the 1870s. An advisor to both Dube and Gandhi on matters of political organisation\nand strategy, he encouraged gradual social change and favoured careful control from\na leadership which would use its influence to maintain order. He was an enthusiastic\nsupporter of Dube\u2019s efforts at Ohlange, and regularly visited the school and made cash\ndonations. Through his offices, the Governor of Natal, Sir Matthew Nathan, visited the\nschool to open a new building in 1908. Dube assured Campbell on several occasions that\nhe would steer clear of politics, but that was before 1912, when he became first president\nof the African National Congress. Campbell did encourage communication \u2014 it was\nunder his auspices that Gandhi and Dube are known to have met. Again, when the\nIndian leader Gopal Krishna Gokhale visited South Africa in 1912, Gandhi acted as his\nsecretary, and he arranged for Gokhale to address a mass rally on Campbell\u2019s estate and\nalso to meet Dube at Ohlange.63 But Campbell also favoured separation of advancement\non racial lines.\nBoth Gandhi and Dube were receptive to such thinking: though they clearly respected\neach other as leaders, they defined their politics in narrowly racial terms. Neither could\nsee any purpose in joint action; in fact, both perceived deep dangers in such a course.\nDube favoured racial separatism largely because he feared the threat that Indians posed to\nAfrican land rights, and could therefore see no common cause. He developed a deep\nrespect for the tactics of passive resistance that Gandhi and his followers deployed in their\nfirst campaign in 1906, and was moved by the bravery of the resisters in the face of police\nbrutality, but nevertheless felt that such tactics would be disastrous among Africans (and\nin any case, such direct action was not ANC style at all).64 Gandhi rejected any alliance\nbecause, according to some, he saw common treatment with Africans as degrading, and\naccording to others, he felt it would have damaged Africans\u2019 cause.65\nIt is somehow fitting that Campbell should be at the centre of an episode that reveals\nthe levels of separation, competition (and on Dube\u2019s part, resentment) between African\nand Indian leaders. Meetings were organised in Durban in 1916 to congratulate Campbell\non the award of his knighthood. The Indians managed to be the first to organise their\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) T\nhe\n S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nthe\n S\ntud\ny o\nf L\nab\nou\nr H\nist\nory\n165African Reactions to Indian Immigration\nevent, and had been able to secure the Town Hall for their lavish celebration. Dube\u2019s\napplication for use of the same venue was rejected on the grounds that Africans were not\nclean enough. Therefore, the African gathering had to be held in the open near the race-\ncourse. In his speech before Campbell\u2019s arrival, Dube told the audience, \u2018It is you people\nwho helped to build the Town Hall, every bit of it. You carried the bricks and the\nstones, and mixed the cement. We are the people of the land, we were born here, and\nyet we have been refused, whereas the Indians were not\u2019.66\nConclusion\nThe theme of African attitudes to Indian immigrants is perhaps more than a footnote in\nthe story of international labour migration, because of the long-term social and political\nconsequences that it would bring in its wake. It would be misleading to suggest that\nAfricans, whether traditionalist or educated, laid all their grievances at the door of Indi-\nans; the record is also replete with criticisms of colonial officialdom and white settlers\nthemselves. Yet it is also the case that the presence of Indians served to deflect much\ntension away from the colonial state: it was a classic case of people with equally little\npurchase on Natal\u2019s land and labour policies blaming each other. It would take decades\nbefore the separate and parallel political paths of their organisations came to be replaced\nwith a commitment to solidarity in the achievement of a non-racial future on the part\nof leadership. Yet, in the layers of society below the leadership, tensions between the\nAfrican majority and Indian minority would continue, however internally differentiated\nthese two groups were.\nReferences\n1 This article began life as a presentation to the African Studies Seminar at the University of Natal (as\nit was then called) in 2000.

On political organisation, particularly important studies include M. Swan, Gandhi: the South\nAfrican Experience. (Johannesburg, 1985); S.

Although somewhat elderly now, two studies\nthat were produced at the height of the revisionist \u2018wave\u2019 in southern African studies remain valuable\noverviews of more general land and labour issues in Natal: P. Richardson, \u2018The Natal sugar industry in\nthe nineteenth century\u2019 in W. Beinart, P. Delius and S Trapido, eds., Putting a Plough to the Ground:\nAccumulation and Dispossession in Rural South Africa 1850\u20131930. (Johannesburg, 1986) pp. 129\u2013175 and\nH.

As an example of recent\nscholarship, see A. Nauriya, The African Element in Gandhi. (New Delhi, 2006).\n5 The two studies are P. Maylam and I. Edwards, eds. The People\u2019s City. African Life in Twentieth-\nCentury Durban. (Portsmouth and Pietermaritzburg, 1996) and Freund, Insiders and Outsiders.\n6 Freund, Insiders and Outsiders, p.xi.\n7 On the 1949 African\u2013Indian conflict, see E.

Bhana and Vahed survey an area that\nis not covered here, the anti-African attitudes which developed among Indian immigrants. It ought to\nbe noted that insightful work has been undertaken in other fields, notably linguistics: see R. Mesthrie,\nLanguage in Indenture: a Socio-Linguistic History of Bhojpuri-Hindi in South Africa (Johannesburg, 1991). The\nemergence of such patois forms testifies to the levels of interaction between Africans and Indians on an\neveryday basis.\n9 For an analysis of early African attitudes to industrial time and discipline, see K. Atkins, The Moon is\nDead! Give us our Money! The Cultural Origins of an African Work Ethic, Natal, South Africa 1843\u20131900.\n(London, 1993).\n10 See P. van den Berghe, Caneville.

Information on the profile of workers is drawn\nfrom G. Vahed, \u2018Constructions of community\u2019, p. 78 and J. Brain, \u2018From co-operation, through\ncompetition, to conflict\u2019 in A.

The social and economic\nimportance of cattle to African people could also explain why there was virtually no intermarriage\nbetween Indians and Africans in this period. Later there was a very small amount in the towns, but\nalways on the margins of both social groups.\n29 For example, see letter from Chief Mqhawe of the Qadi to Secretary for Native Affairs, 3 March\n1890, SNA 1\/1\/123 (322\/1890).\n30 This argument was first advanced by H.

This was with\nthe express purpose of ensuring a base for communal homestead production and in this sense ought to\nbe distinguished from individual purchases by educated converts intent on commercial production.\nSee J.

Marks, The Ambiguities of Dependence in South\nAfrica. (Johannesburg, 1986) chapter 3, and M. Swanson, ed., The Views of Mahlathi [Champion].\n(Pietermaritzburg and Durban, 1982).\n51 Because of Dube\u2019s prominence in early national politics as well as because of his considerable other\nachievements, he has been the subject of many studies. See for example S. Marks, The Ambiguities\nof Dependence, chapter 2; R. Hunt Davis, \u2018John L. Dube, a South African exponent of Booker T. Wash-\nington\u2019, Journal of African Studies vol. 2, no. 4 (1976) pp. 497\u2013528; H.

Marks, Reluctant Rebellion: the 1906\u20131908 Distur-\nbances in Natal. (Oxford 1974) pp. 332\u20135, and M.

Unpublished\nMA dissertation, Historical Studies, University of Natal, 2003.\n53 Dube\u2019s anti-Indianism did not translate itself into support for segregation in the sense of legislative\nmeasures for the protection of African land. In fact he was deeply opposed to legislation such as the\nLand Act of 1913, which enforced the possessory segregation of land along racial lines, although he\ncame to support such measures in the 1930s. See Marks, The Ambiguities of Dependence, chapter 2.\n54 Ilanga lase Natal, 11 December 1903.\n55 Ilanga lase Natal, 20 November 1903.\n56 J.
