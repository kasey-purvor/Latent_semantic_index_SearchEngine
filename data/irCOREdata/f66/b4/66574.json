As a consequence, \u201elevels of decisionmaking have \nbeen conventionally examined as if they were independent\u201f (Adger et al. 2003: 1101; \nsee also Cowell 2003; Gibbs and Jonas 2001), with the concomitant assumption that \ndecisions are \u201ecascaded\u201f from international, to national, and then local scales (Bulkeley \nand Betsill 2003; Owens 2004). This paper argues that such understandings of the \nspatial and scalar configurations of environmental governance obscure the manifold \nways in which such issues are created, constructed, regulated and contested between, \nacross and among scales, and through hybrid governing arrangements which operate in \nnetwork terms. In order to develop an alternative account of the geographies of \nenvironmental governance, this paper examines one example through which such \ngovernance takes place - transnational municipal networks (TMN)\n1\n. The growing \nprevalence of TMN concerned with issues of economic development within Europe has \nbeen noted by several authors (Bennington and Harvey 1999; Heeg et al. 2002; Jeffery \n2000; Leitner and Shepperd 2002; Leitner et al. 2002; Schultze 2003). Comparatively \nless attention has been directed towards TMN whose focus is on issues of \nenvironmental sustainability (Betsill and Bulkeley 2004; Bulkeley et al. 2003; Kern \n2001; Ward and Williams 1997). The development of these networks has been fostered \nboth by the call in Chapter 28 of Agenda 21 \u201eto establish processes to increase the \nexchange of information, experience and mutual technical assistance among local \nauthorities\u201f (UN 1992) as well as through the European Commission which established \nthe European Sustainable Cities and Towns Campaign and has provided funding to \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 4 \nseveral TMN operating in the area of environmental sustainability. By the mid-1990s, \ntwenty-eight such networks were operating in Europe alone (Ward and Williams 1997), \nthough given that the Directorate-General for Regional Policy and Cohesion provides \nfunding for \u201eseveral thousand transnational network projects over a limited time period\u201f \n(Leitner et al. 2002: 293) this is probably an under-estimate of network projects relating \nto urban sustainability. Internationally, the International Council for Local \nEnvironmental Initiatives (ICLEI) has established a Local Agenda 21 campaign, the \nCities for Climate Protection programme, and most recently the Water Campaign, while \nUN-Habitat has fostered the development of the Sustainable Cities Programme.  \n \nThis paper examines the ways in which TMN challenge traditional accounts of \nenvironmental governance, and explores the \u201espatial grammar\u201f which such networks \nconfigure. In doing so, the paper draws upon recent (geographic) debates about the \npolitics of scale and the rescaling of the state, as well as the specific example of the \nCities for Climate Protection (CCP) programme (Bulkeley and Betsill 2003). In order to \nexamine the implicit understandings of space and scale which are currently reproduced \nin analyses of environmental governance, the first section focuses on accounts of global \nenvironmental governance. The paper then moves to examine recent debates on the \npolitics of scale in order to establish what insights can be derived for an analysis of \nenvironmental governance. It provides an account which seeks to move beyond the \npolarised debate between \u201escalar\u201f and \u201enon-scalar\u201f perspectives, through revising the \nways in which concepts of hierarchy and territory are deployed to make sense of a \npolitics of scale and a politics of networks. The third section develops this argument \nfurther by examining how the CCP programme engages in both a politics of scale and in \ncreating a new \u201esphere of authority\u201f within which governance is organised in network \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 5 \nterms. The argument is made that a new spatial grammar of environmental governance \nneeds to make space both for processes of scaling the state (and other institutions) and \nfor network forms of governing. In conclusion, the implications of this approach for \nenvironmental governance are considered.   \n \n \nCONCEPTUALIZING GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE: BEYOND \nTHE TERRITORIAL TRAP? \n \nWhile there are a multitude of perspectives and interpretations of the term governance, \nit implies a focus on \u201csystems of governing\u201d, means for \u201eauthoritatively allocating \nresources and exercising control and co-ordination\u201f (Rhodes 1996: 653), in which state \nactors are not necessarily the only or most significant participants. Rather than seeing \n\u201egovernment\u201f and \u201egovernance\u201f as necessarily opposite, this interpretation suggests a \ncontinuum of systems of governing, in which state and non-state actors play a variety of \nroles. Mirroring shifts within the political and social sciences more broadly, governance \n\u201ehas become one of the key themes in global environmental politics\u201f (Paterson et al. \n2003: 1). Nevertheless, there is considerable diversity in the ways in which global \nenvironmental governance has been understood, with divergent interpretations of the \nkey terms global - either as a scale of activity or as the result of the process of \nglobalisation \u2013 environmental - strictly or broadly defined - and governance - seen in \nopposition to government, as new forms of governmentality or as the positive resolution \nof environmental problems (Paterson et al. 2003; see also Adger et al. 2003). The \nvarious conjunctions of these interpretations means that for some, global environmental \ngovernance entails the creation of global institutions through which to manage global \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 6 \ncommons, while for others it relates to the emergence of transnational networks and \nnew forms of civil society. Though there are further positions which lie between and \nbeyond these characterisations, as the pre-dominant approaches each provides insight \ninto the ways in which particular concepts of space and scale are deployed in the \nanalysis of global environmental governance.   \n \nGoing Global \n \nFor the majority of scholars working within the tradition of international relations, the \ngovernance of global environmental issues takes place through international regimes. In \nthis view, the management of both global environmental problems, those like climate \nchange whose origins and impacts stretch over all state boundaries, and \u201eleaky\u201f local \nissues such as biodiversity, which while grounded in particular places spill over their \nboundaries (Castree 2003: 424), requires the formation of international institutions \n(Paterson 2001). While authority and legitimacy reside with nation-states, regimes, \n\u201esocial institutions that consist of agreed upon principles, norms, rules, decision-making \nprocedures, and programs that govern the interactions of actors in specific issue areas.\u201f \n(Young, O. 1997: 5-6), are formed in a specific issue area to facilitate cooperation by \nproviding information and reducing transaction costs (Hasenclever et al. 1997). The \nfunction of such regimes is envisaged as plugging the gaps between state spaces, or \nexpanding the collective territoriality of the state into the atmosphere and oceans. \nRegimes both strengthen the territoriality of nation-states, by reinforcing the importance \nof the inter-state system, while at the same time weakening notions of territorial \nsovereignty by allowing the \u201eglobal community\u201f (sometimes hegemonic states or \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 7 \ncollectives) to regulate processes occurring within what is frequently considered to be \nsovereign state space.  \n \nFramed as problems of collective action between sovereign states, within traditional \naccounts of global environmental politics the notion of the state as the primary arena of \npolitical power remains unchallenged and there have been relatively few analyses of the \nchanging nature of the state or sovereignty (for exceptions see Karkkaninen 2004; Litfin \n1998). While regimes may assume a degree of control over states, they are seen to be \ncreated by and for states, either on the basis of the initiative of a hegemonic state or \nthrough interest-based inter-state bargaining. In this way, regime theory, like other \naspects of international relations, falls into what Agnew (1999) has called the \u201eterritorial \ntrap\u201f, in essence the naturalization of \u201estate space\u201f as the taken-for granted demarcation \nof political power (Brenner et al. 2003: 2). This involves implicit assumptions that: the \nboundaries of states make them both sovereign and exclusive; that a neat division can \nbe cleaved between domestic and international politics; and that modern social and \neconomic life is \u201econtained\u201f within the borders of the state (Agnew 1999; see also \nBrenner et al. 2003). In this view, global environmental issues are governed by and \nthrough states, albeit with some cession of state powers to new inter-state institutions \nand the influence of different groups of actors, including NGOs and scientists, \nacknowledged. As Paterson (2001: 2) argues, the \u201efundamental (yet largely \nunacknowledged, and certainly unexamined) commitments in this understanding of \nglobal environmental politics are of an inter-state understanding of global politics, a \nliberal understanding of political economy, of the neutrality of science\u201f.  \n \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 8 \nThis reading of the relations between the state, environment and globalisation have been \npartially challenged by \u201cknowledge-based\u201d or \u201cconstructivist\u201d approaches, which view \ninternational regimes as a means through which cognitive and normative aspects of \nenvironmental issues come to be constructed and learnt, in turn shaping the ways in \nwhich states perceive their interests (Hasenenclever et al. 1997; Litfin 1994; Newell \n2000; Paterson 1996; Payne 2001). These approaches have begun to open up the \nboundaries of the state, and to consider the influence of domestic politics on \ninternational relations and vice versa. At the same time, the roles of non-state actors in \nthe process of regime formation and policy implementation are increasingly \nacknowledged. However, in the main, the significance of non-state actors lies in the \nextent to which they shape, facilitate or change the behaviour of nation-states within \ninternational regimes (Auer 2000; Bulkeley and Betsill 2003; Litfin 1993). While such \nperspectives call into question liberal notions of political economy and the neutrality of \nscience, and acknowledge the redistribution of state functions towards new institutions \nand to non-state actors, in the main assumptions about the nature of the state remain \nunder-examined.  \n \nLikewise, within both traditional and constructivist accounts of  regimes, the scales at \nwhich environmental governance takes place are treated as hierarchical and discrete, \u201eas \n\u2026self-enclosed political territories within a nested hierarchy of geographical arenas \ncontained within each other like so many Russian dolls\u201f (Brenner et al. 2003: 1). For the \nmost part, the scope of global environmental governance is confined to an imagined \nglobal scale, either in terms of the nature of the problems to be governed or in terms of \nthe institutional solutions which are considered appropriate (Ford 2003; Patterson et al. \n2003). In this reading, the governance of global environmental issues requires global \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 9 \nsolutions which are then \u201ecascaded\u201f down through national, and implicitly, sub-national \narenas of governance (Bulkeley and Betsill 2003: 15-16). This naturalisation of the \n\u201eglobal\u201f as the arena in which designated global environmental problems take place \neffectively serves to disembody the causes and consequences of such problems, and \ntheir construction as such, from practices and politics taking place at a multitude of sites \nand scales of governance. Alternative accounts have begun to move beyond the global \nas the only significant arena in which global environmental governance takes place. For \nexample, Vogler (2003: 30), drawing on the concept of multilevel governance envisages \n\u201ea nested hierarchy of governance levels reaching down from the inter-state to the local \nlevel\u201f. However, the scales of governance remain bounded, and there is little \nconsideration of the possibilities that the governance of global environmental issues \nmight emanate from the \u201ebottom up\u201f.   \n \nTransnational Networks \n \nAlongside the fixed territorial spaces and hierarchical scales of global environmental \ngovernance, alternative approaches which focus on horizontal governance structures are \nemerging. Characterized in network terms, there is increasing interest in the role of \nactors and institutions which operate simultaneously across multiple scales (Jakobsen \n2000; Lipschutz and Conca 1993; Newell 2000; O\u201fBrien et al. 2000; Smith et al. 1997; \nWapner 1996). In particular, three transnational network concepts have been developed \nin relation to global environmental governance (Betsill and Bulkeley 2004): epistemic \ncommunities (Haas 1990); transnational advocacy coalitions (Keck and Sikkink 1998); \nand global civil society (Lipschutz 1996).  \n \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 10 \nAn epistemic community can be defined as a network of experts who share a common \nunderstanding of the scientific and political nature of a particular problem (Haas 1990; \nPaterson 1996). A transnational advocacy network (TAN), on the other hand, includes a \nbroader range of actors, working internationally on an issue and \u201cbound together by \nshared values, a common discourse, and dense exchanges of information and services\u201d \n(Keck and Sikkink 1998: 2). Both types of network, which may consist of state and non-\nstate actors, are seen to operate simultaneously within domestic and international \npolitical arenas. Likewise, both theories stress that political authority accrues to \nnetworks through their ability to garner and deploy information, knowledge and values \n(Haas 1990; Lipschutz 1996; Keck and Sikkink 1998). Here, power is seen to ensue \nfrom multiple sources of authority, including expertise and moral positions. However, \nin the epistemic communities approach networks are envisaged as conduits for the \nexchange of information, while the TAN approach recognizes that knowledge is \ncontested as actors seek to frame \u201ethe terms and nature of the debate\u201f (Keck and Sikkink \n1998: 2). Nevertheless, in each case the power of transnational networks lies in their \nability to influence nation-states, which remain the location of governance (Auer 2000: \n159; Litfin 1993: 96; Rosenau 2000: 170). While these approaches suggest that global \nenvironmental issues have led to the creation of networks of transnational political \nrelations which go beyond those found in inter-state connections, the authority of such \nnetworks remains tied to traditional political arenas, primarily the nation-state (Betsill \nand Bulkeley 2004). \n \nIn a third approach, sometimes labelled \u201eglobal civil society\u201f, scholars have begun to \nexamine the role of transnational networks in a more radical way\n2\n (Ford 2003; \nLipschutz 1996; Wapner 1998). These approaches move away from state-centred \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 11 \nanalyses to consider the multiplicity of actors and institutions that influence the ways in \nwhich global environmental issues are addressed across different scales. From this \nperspective, global environmental governance is not only the province of interstate \nnegotiations and regimes. Rather, governance takes place through \u201espheres of authority\u201f \n(Rosenau 1997) which may be territorially based or non-territorial networks that \ncompete and co-operate through the exercise of formal and informal authority. In other \nwords: \n \nGovernance occurs on a global scale through both the co-ordination of states \nand the activities of a vast array of rule systems that exercise authority in the \npursuit of goals that function outside normal national jurisdictions. (Rosenau \n2000: 172) \n \nIn this view, not only are networks considered influential in so far as they shape the \nrange and extent of state action, but also as an important site for the governance of \nglobal environmental issues in their own right. In part, this shift of focus involves a re-\nconceptualisation of the causes of global environmental problems, away from the \nemphasis on a tragedy of the global commons or global trends in population, \nconsumption or some other variable, and towards the \u201epractices which produce global \nenvironmental change, which are necessarily \u201clocal\u201d\u201f (Paterson 2001: 9). It is also \nreflective of a belief that \u201ewhile governments are the main authoritative political \ninstitutions, politics as an activity or politically relevant behaviour is not exhausted by \nthem\u201f (Wapner 1996: 7). Here, political authority is not confined to territorially \ndelimited entities, such as global regimes and nation-states, but accrues in non-state \nspaces. However, and despite Rosenau\u201fs acknowledgement that governance involves \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 12 \nthe intermeshing of forms of state and non-state authority, most discussions of \ntransnational networks tend to assume that they primarily consist of, and behave as, \nnon-state entities. Moreover, while some of the analysis of transnational networks \nsignals an escape route from the \u201eterritorial trap\u201f, the core assumption that the state is a \nsingular, sovereign and bounded unit has remained largely unchallenged. Lipschutz \n(1996: 57) takes a more nuanced view of the state, acknowledging that states are \u201cmulti-\nlevel, pervasive and in constant conflict with themselves\u201d, and that complex relations \nexist between different levels of government and (non) state actors which implement \ngovernment policy. However, his analysis of the emergence of networks within global \ncivil society is primarily concerned with the links being forged between non-state actors \nacross different places and at different scales, with the role of state entities significant in \nso far as they facilitate or impede this process (Lipschutz 1996: 98).  \n \nSpace, Scale and Global Environmental Governance \n \nWithin these different approaches, three distinct configurations of the spaces and scales \nof global environmental governance can be discerned. The first, associated with \nmainstream regime theory and some constructivist accounts, is based on the nation-state \nas the primary arena of political authority and on a hierarchical model of the scales of \nenvironmental governance. The second, common to some constructivist approaches to \nregimes and transnational network theories, also takes state-space for granted, but \ndisrupts hierarchical notions of scale through the presence of horizontal networks. The \nthird, associated with global civil society, similarly disrupts notions of the hierarchies of \nenvironmental governance and begins to locate political authority in networks outside \nstate-space, but in turning its attention to non-state actors ironically leaves the nature of \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 13 \nstate space unexamined. Such configurations leave no analytical space for \nenvironmental governance arrangements which are hybrid, involving a mix of state and \nnon-state actors, or multi-scalar, including actors drawn from different levels of \ngovernance simultaneously, and provide little insight into how different forms of \nhierarchical and network governance interact and intersect to produce particular \ngovernance forms, mechanisms and outcomes. While Rosenau\u201fs concept of \u201espheres of \nauthority\u201f provides a potential starting point for conceptualising such governance \narrangements, it is \u201eframed in very general terms, offering few specifics as to the \npatterns and principles that define these new emergent structures.\u201f (Karkkainen 2004: \n74).  \n \nIn picking up where \u201eRosenau and others leave off\u201f, Karkkainen (2004: 74) proposes \nthat a \u201epost-sovereign\u201f account of environmental governance is needed in order to \nanalyse emergent hybrid, problem-solving governance arrangements. Such collaborative \ngovernance arrangements can include state actors, sub-national governments, \nmultilateral institutions, NGOs, businesses interests and scientists, and \u201erepresent a \nnascent polycentric substitute for more familiar forms of sovereign authority, operating \nwithin a limited subject-matter sphere and at a spatial scale whose boundaries are \ndefined by the nature and scale of the problem to be addressed\u201f (Karkkainen 2004: 74). \nThese governance arrangements, he argues, are non-exclusive, in that there is no \nexclusive sovereign authority, non-hierarchical, in the sense that authority is not \npredicated on command and control, and post-territorial, in that the \u201espatial and \nconceptual boundaries are defined not by reference to fixed, territorially delimited \njurisdictional lines\u201f (Karkkainen 2004: 77). Karkkainen\u201fs analysis of governance \narrangements in the North American Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay Program \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 14 \nillustrates how elements of this \u201epost-sovereign\u201f environmental governance are taking \nshape. This \u201epost-territorial\u201f account begins to move beyond the usual spatial and scalar \nconfigurations of environmental governance, and acknowledges that the space and scale \nof the problem in question changes through competing interpretations. However, there \nis an assumption that the problems under consideration, and the governance \narrangements which they provoke, are territorially integrated and delimited by \n\u201eappropriate eco-regional scales\u201f (Karkkainen 2004: 92). Such an approach can not \ncapture the range of hybrid, territorially disintegrated,  transnational networks through \nwhich environmental governance takes place. Moreover, despite taking a \u201epost-\nterritorial\u201f approach, the spaces of environmental governance remain territorially rooted \nand the issue of scale treated in only cursory terms. In order to offer alternative \ngeographies of environmental governance, which can move beyond the predominant \nconfigurations of space and scale, with the concomitant exclusions and omissions they \nimplicitly create, an engagement with the literatures on the politics of scale and \nrescaling the state may prove productive.  \n \n \nNEW GEOGRAPHIES OF GOVERNANCE \n \nAs has recently been argued, \u201eglobal environmental governance can not be understood \nseparately from broader shifts in authority in global politics.\u201f (Paterson et al. 2003: 7). \nSeveral commentators suggest that an important dynamic in the shifting authority of \nglobal politics is the changing nature of state spatiality, in which the state is being \nreconfigured and rearticulated across spatial scales creating new \u201egeographies of \ngovernance\u201f (MacLeod and Goodwin 1999: 505; see also Brenner 1998a, 1998b, 1999; \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 15 \nElden 2005; MacLeod 2001; MacLeod and Jones 2003). These new geographies of \ngovernance have been variously described as a \u201cnew medievalism\u201d (Anderson 1996), \nsignifying the presence of overlapping and competing authorities at different scales, as \n\u201cglocalization\u201d (Swyngedouw 2000), the global local simultaneity of economic \nrestructuring, or as the \u201chollowing out\u201d of the state, as the functions of the state are \nredistributed upwards, to international and transnational organisations and institutions, \ndownwards, to cities and regions, and outwards, to non-state actors (Jessop 2002; \nMacLeod and Goodwin 1999; Pierre and Peters 2000). To date, the implications of such \nshifts for global and other forms of environmental governance have largely been \nignored. Despite differences in approach, all three perspectives suggest that the \u201cpolitics \nof scale\u201d is a key element in understanding shifts in the nature of the state and its \nauthority, and hence for the nature of environmental governance. However, despite \nattempts to clarify the terms of debate (Brenner 2001; Purcell 2003), there remains some \nambiguity as to what such a politics involves and, in particular, as to the ways in which \nconcepts of hierarchy and territory are deployed in order to fashion an understanding of \nthe politics of scale, as well as the extent to which scalar and network accounts of \nspatiality must necessarily be in opposition. After a brief outline of the debate, a novel \ninterpretation of these issues is developed to support the argument that scalar and \nnetwork perspectives are mutually constitutive, and the insights which can be derived \nfrom the politics of scale debate in relation to environmental governance are considered. \n \nScalar Politics \n \nIt has become an accepted truism within human geography that scales are socially and \npolitically constructed, and thus contested (Brenner 2001; Marston 2000; McCann \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 16 \n2003). The politics of scale involves \u201econtinuous reshuffling and reorganisations of \nspatial scales\u201f which are \u201ean integral part of social strategies and struggles for control \nand empowerment\u201f (Swyngedouw 2000: 70). Such struggles are important because \u201ethe \nparticular ways in which scale is produced have material consequences. Scale making is \nnot only a discursive practice, it is also the tangible outcome of the practices of \neveryday life as they articulate with and transform macro-level social structures\u201f \n(Marston 2004: 173; see also Boyle 2002). The notion of a politics of scale has been \napplied to an extensive range of issues, though most predominantly those concerned \nwith the uneven development of capital, the changing nature of state power and \nregulation, and social action and contestation (Brenner 2001: 592; Swyngedouw 2004: \n132). Despite the number of authors who increasingly examine the multiple politics of \nscaling, the criticism has been leveled that attention has primarily focused on capitalist \nproduction and the state, to the exclusion of issues of social reproduction and \nconsumption (Marston 2000, 2004; Purcell 2003). Equally, the focus on the state has \nbeen preoccupied with the re-territorialisation, reconfiguration and re-articulation of the \nstate as a result of, and with respect to, the processes of economic restructuring wrought \nby neoliberal globalisation, rather than with a wider conception of the regulative and \ngovernance roles which the state undertakes. As a consequence, questions of \nenvironment and its governance have remained outside much of this literature (though \nsee discussion below, and Boyle 2002; Gibbs and Jonas 2001; Swyngedouw 2004).  \n \nThe focus of analysis on the politics of scale and the state has been the process of \nrescaling, the ways \u201ein which policies and politics which formerly took place at one \nscale are shifted to others in ways that reshape the practices themselves, redefine the \nscales to and from which they are shifted, and reorganise interactions between scales\u201f \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 17 \n(McCann 2003: 162). Most analysts have taken a \u201crelational\u201d view of the politics of \nstate scale, and focused \u201eon the shifting organizational, strategic, discursive and \nsymbolic relationships between a range of intertwined geographical scales and on the \nramifications of such interscalar transformations for the representations, meanings, \nfunctions and organizational structures of those scales\u201f (Brenner 2001: 600). Equally, \nthe emphasis has been on a \u201cprocess based\u201d understanding of scale, in which \u201escalar \nconfigurations\u201f are seen to be \u201ethe outcome of sociospatial processes that regulate and \norganize sociospatial relations\u201f (Swyngedouw 2004: 132; see also Brenner 2001: 604). \nAs such, the \u201epriority, both theoretically and politically, therefore never resides in a \nparticular social or ecological geographical scale; instead, it resides in the socio-\necological process through which particular social and environmental scales become \nconstituted and subsequently reconsitituted\u201f (Swyngedouw and Heynen 2003: 912).  \n \nUnderpinning this interpretation of the politics of scale is a rejection of the notion of \nscale as a bounded, territorially complete concept, and of any notion that social relations \nare \u201ccontained\u201d at particular scales. This suggests that two of the most common \nmetaphors for describing relations between scales, that of the \u201cladder\u201d, where global, \nnational and local scales are separately ordered above each other, or the \u201cRussian dolls\u201d, \nwhere discrete scales are contained within one another (Herod and Wright 2003), no \nlonger suffice. As Amin has argued, \u201ethe growing routinisation of global network \npractices \u2013 manifest through mobility and connectivity \u2013 signals a perforation of scalar \nand territorial forms of social organisation. This subverts any ontology of territorial \ncontainment and scalar nesting\u201f (2002: 395). Consequently, in conceptualising the \npolitics of scale it should be recognised that \u201escales evolve relationally within tangled \nhierarchies and dispersed interscalar networks\u201f (Brenner 2001: 605), so that the \u201ethe \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 18 \nvery intelligibility of each scalar articulation of a social process hinges crucially upon \nits embededness within dense webs of relations to other scales and spaces\u2019 (Brenner \n2001: 606). Not only does this entail the recognition that what constitutes the regional, \nurban or the local is not contained within a particular physical territory (Jones and \nMacLeod 2004; Painter 1999; Swyngedouw and Heyen 2003) but rather socially and \npolitically constructed as such within and between variously configured networks of \nactors, but also that the very process of enrolling particular actors and networks into \nscalar constructions is part of the politics of scaling.  \n \nThis reading suggests that the recognition of the networked nature of social relations \ndoes not necessarily preclude an analysis of scale. The potential for integrating scalar \nand networked accounts of spatiality depends on how the concept of network is \nconceived. Use of network terms and concepts has proliferated. For some, the \u201etypology \nof networks now extends to business and trade, policy and advocacy, knowledge and the \nprofessions, together with empire and terror, kinship and friendship, religion and \nmigration\u201f (Holton 2005: 209). For others, the mix is yet more diverse, including \ninfrastructures, commodities, faith communities, transnational movements of all kinds, \nviruses, and spaces of emotional attachment (Amin 2004: 33-34). In seeking to bring \nsome definitional clarity to this amorphous mass, various commentators have offered \ntypologies of networks. Dicken et al. (2001: 92) distinguish between \u201ethe use of the \nnetwork as an analytical tool, which aims to map the topological structures of social \nrelationships, and the network as a form of governance\u201f. Leitner et al. (2002: 276-286) \nidentify four different network debates, in economic geography concerning inter-firm \nlinkages, regional economies and international trade, in the form of \u201epolicy networks\u201f, \nthrough social network analysis, and in relation to \u201eactor-network theory\u201f. Painter \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 19 \n(2004) provides a broader and more insightful account: transmission networks facilitate \nthe flows of substances and agents, social networks are comprised of the links created \nby and through social relations, in economic, cultural and political spheres, actor-\nnetworks involve both the movement of material things and the simultaneous creation of \nsocial relations, while topological networks describe the complex spatiality of actor-\nnetworks. Within the literature on global environmental governance reviewed above, \nnetworks are primarily conceived as social networks, though an acknowledgement of \nthe materiality of their operation and practice also lends itself to actor-network \ninterpretations.   \n \nThinking about networks in transmission, social or actor-network terms is not \nnecessarily to exclude an understanding of spatiality through a relational and process \nbased approach to the politics of scale. However, in drawing attention to the ways in \nwhich particular spatial fixes and scalar configurations are discursively, materially and \ninstitutionally constructed in order to strengthen the \u201epower and control of some while \ndisempowering others\u201f (Swyngedouw 2000: 71; see also Jones and MacLeod 2004), \nsuch scalar readings are sometimes regarded as antithetical to topological accounts of \nnetworks, a point which is returned to below.  \n \nNegotiating hierarchy and territory \n \nAlthough both network and scalar approaches are concerned with social (and, in some \ncases, material) relations, they are often distinguished in terms of whether these \nrelations are \u201ehorizontal\u201f, in the case of networks, or \u201evertical\u201f, in the case of scales.  \nDespite the purported relational approach adopted in much of the literature concerned \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 20 \nwith the politics of scale, there is a lack of clarity as to how relations between scales \nshould be conceptualised. For Brenner, (1998b: 478) \u201ethe capacity of geographical scale \nto circumscribe and heirarchize social relations within relatively fixed and provisionally \nstablized configuration is central to their role as sources of power and control over \nsocial space\u201f. Here, it is precisely the hierarchical (vertical) nature of scale which leads \nto the struggle to define and articulate particular processes and projects as taking place \nat or within particular scales. Indeed, Brenner has argued that in order to realise the \ntheoretical potential of the concept of scale, \u201eit is crucial to distinguish what might be \ntermed scalar structurations of social space \u2013 which \u2026 involve relations of \nheirarchization and reheirarchization among vertically differentiated spatial units \u2013 from \nother forms of sociospatial structuration, such as place-making, localization, and \nterritorialization\u201f (2001: 603).3 This position may seem in contradiction to the assertion \nof the relational nature of processes of scaling and recognition of the (networked) \nconnectivity of social relations. However, in the same paper, it is suggested that \n\u201eprocesses of scalar structuration do not produce a single nested scalar hierarchy, an \nabsolute pyramid of neatly interlocking scales, but are better understood as a mosaic of \nunevenly superimposed and densely interlayered scalar geometries\u201f (Brenner 2001: \n606). The metaphor of a scale \u201emosaic\u201f has some resonance with Howitt\u201fs conception of \nscale in musical terms, and his argument that it is \u201ein cross-scale linkages, awkward \njuxtapositions and jumps, and non-hierarchical dialectics that the nature and \nsignificance of scale is to be found\u201f (Howitt 2003: 145-146). Whether or not \n\u201ehierarchical\u201f conceptions of scale run counter to more fluid relational accounts of \nspace, place and spatiality depends on how hierarchy itself is understood.  \n \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 21 \nSurprisingly, for a term which is so critical to the discussion of scale and considering \nthe level of debate the concept has received, the notion of hierarchy has attracted scant \nattention. In scalar discourse, the term is usually taken to mean that one scale is bigger \nor more extensive than another, so that scales are hierarchically ordered from the global \nto the local in ever decreasing circles. Arguments for a non-hierarchical conception of \nscale are primarily concerned with rejecting any such configuration (Howitt 1998; 2003; \nMarston and Smith 2001). However, Brenner\u201fs comments suggest there may be more to \nhierarchy\n4\n. Indeed, the OED definition of hierarchy suggests it has two meanings, either \n\u201ea ranking system ordered according to status or authority\u2019 or \u2018an arrangement \naccording to relative importance or inclusiveness\u2019. To date, conceptualisation of scalar \nrelations in hierarchical terms has tended to focus on the latter, an arrangement \naccording to the relative inclusiveness of different scales. Once the term is expanded to \ninclude relations of status, authority and importance, it is clear that hierarchies of scale \ndo not necessarily need to be ordered in spatially extensive terms from the global to the \nlocal, but can take different forms depending on the social relations in question. For \nexample, in a dispute over a particular development proposal, national government may \nfind itself subsumed by European legislation and coalitions of local actors. In this \nreading, hierarchies (in so far as they pertain to relations of dominance and \nsubservience) between social relations and processes constructed and constituted at \ndifferent scales persist and structure the politics of scaling. In effect, processes of \nscaling and rescaling are one means through which hierarchies of social relations are \nreproduced, contested and reworked. \n \nOthers reject the notion of hierarchy. Herod and Wright (2002: 8) suggest that \nrecognition of networked social and natural relations requires an alternative approach to \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 22 \nscale, based on metaphors of \u201ethe root system of a tree or perhaps in terms of the tunnels \nmade by earthworms\u201f where discrete levels, and hence hierarchical relations between \nthem, are removed. Whether it is meaningful to talk about the spatialities of such \nnetworked social relations in scale terms is moot. For some, what is needed instead is a \n\u201ea reading of spatiality in nonlinear, nonscalar terms, a readiness to accept geographies \nand temporalities as they are produced through practices and relations of different \nspatial stretch and duration\u201f (Amin 2002: 389). For example, Smith (2003: 572) \nsuggests a non-scalar topological account of global cities, in which \u201ecities \u2026 are hybrid \nand porous translocal sites that are criss-crossed by the multiple lines of networks that \nare more or less long and more or less durable\u201f. Such approaches, born out of relational \nunderstandings of spatiality, seek to reject the na\u00efve nested hierarchy of many accounts \nof scale together with territorial understandings of place, in order to recognise a \ntopological account of actor-networks (Amin 2002, 2004). This approach rails against \nthe \u201eassumption that there is a defined geographic territory out there over which local \nactors can have effective control and can manage as a social and political space\u201f (Amin \n2004: 36). From this view, the politics of scale is inextricably bound up with delineating \nparticular physical territories of control (Amin 2002: 387). As this is \u201einvariably \nmisguided because such boundary acts are always false attempts to shut-out (or at least \nameliorate the impacts of) translocal ties that in part constitute those places\u201f (Castree \n2004: 135), those who advocate a relational approach to place are suspicious of the \nvalue of scalar or territorial accounts and place them in contradistinction to topological \nnetwork readings of spatiality (Amin 2002, 2004; Amin et al. 2003).  \n \nThere are at least three counter arguments. The first is that to assume scalar spatialities \nare necessarily wedded to simple territorial accounts of place is perhaps unfounded. \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 23 \nIndeed, far from taking a na\u00efve view of the local, regional, or national as pre-given, \nhomogenous and intact, those accounts emanating from debates on the politics of scale \nare concerned with the very processes through which such scalar constructions are \nwrought, and through which the rescaling of identities, governing structures, issues and \nso on, take place. Such processes, it is frequently contended, are not bound in territorial \nterms but take place through various networks and spaces of engagement (Cox 1998; \nsee also Castree 2004; Cowell 2003; Jones and MacLeod 2004). Given that Amin \n(2002: 396) is at pains to point out that his arguments concerning the spatialities of \nglobalisation are not intended to \u201edeny the continuing existence and relevance of scalar \npractices and institutions\u201f nor to \u201equestion scalar politics\u201f it appears there may be at \nleast some common ground here.  \n \nA second set of arguments relates to the issue of boundaries (see also Painter 2004). For \nthose concerned with the politics of scale, a key concern is how boundaries around \nsocial\/material relations are formed, and the resulting \u201econtinuous reorganisation of \nspatial scales\u201f as \u201ean integral part of social strategies to combat and defend control over \nlimited resources and\/or a struggle for empowerment\u201f (Swyngedouw and Heyen 2003: \n913). In contrast, those advocating topological approaches contend that in seeing the \n\u201eworld as a horizontality of relations\u201f there is \u201ean infinite tangle of associations\u201f, with \n\u201eno masters and no servants\u201f (Smith 2003: 565). Drawing on Deluze, the argument is \nmade that \u201eit\u201fs not beginnings and ends that count, but middles\u201f (Deluze 1995: 160-61, \ncited in Smith 2003: 565). The result, to give one example, \u201eis cities and regions \nwithout prescribed or proscribed boundaries\u2019 (Amin 2004: 34, emphasis in the \noriginal). The fluidity of network concepts seems to undermine notions of boundaries \n(Holton 2005). However, whether boundaries, the beginnings and ends, can or should \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 24 \nbe so easily dismissed is problematic \u2013 as the experience of asylum seekers, individuals \nexcluded from social networks, or households without connection to basic services all \ntoo readily illustrate. Moreover, network accounts are, or course, not without their \nboundaries, though these are often lost in the indistinct edges of networks and the lack \nof critical attention paid to delineating one network from another. A recognition that \nscalar boundaries are fluid and contested, and that networks are bounded too, may \nprovide the basis for further constructive dialogue. \n \nThis leads to a third means through which the apparent opposition of scalar and network \nperspectives can be questioned, by considering the ways in which (bounded) networks \nhave a scalar dimension (Brenner 2001; Leitner et al. 2002). Topological accounts refer \nto networks which are of \u201evarying length and duration\u201f (Amin 2004: 34), or as \u201emore or \nless long and more or less durable\u201f (Smith 2003: 572). These references to the scope of \nnetworks is similar to nested interpretations of scale which take \u201eextent\u201f as the measure \nof spatiality. However, as the example of the CCP programme outlined in detail below \nmakes clear, there is more to the scalar dimensions of networks than merely their extent \nand reach. The argument is made that once the concept of scale is freed from notions of \ncontained and contiguous territories, and the socially constructed, relational nature of \nscale is taken into account, it is possible to argue that these networks have a scalar \ndimension, both in terms of the ways in which they operate and the ways in which they \nare framed, configured and crystallised.  \n \nFrom this summary, it appears that both those adopting a relational, process-based \napproach to the politics of scale and those who avow a non-scalar approach, share an \nacknowledgement of the networked nature of social relations and a critique of \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 25 \nperspectives which take scale as an ontologically pre-given, bounded and nested entity. \nWhile differences clearly remain in these perspectives, not least over issues of how \nhierarchy, territory and networks are conceptualised and their relative significance, this \nsuggests that any polarisation of the debate into \u201escalar\u201f and \u201enon-scalar\u201f perspectives \nshould be avoided. Rather, \u201egeographical scales and networks of spatial connectivity\u201f \ncan be seen as \u201emutually constitutive rather than mutually exclusive aspects of social \nspatiality\u201f (Brenner 2001: 610).  \n \nRescaling Environmental Governance? \n \nThe literature on the politics of scale has provided some significant insights into the \nsocially and politically constructed nature of scale, and the ways which processes of \nscaling and rescaling are intertwined with struggles for dominance and control. That \nsuch processes are a key element of contemporary state spatialities is evident from the \nextensive literature which has examined the politics of scale and state restructuring, and \nin particular the role of cities and regions (Brenner 2003; MacLeod 2001). While the \nimplications for environmental governance have largely been neglected in this \nliterature, Gibbs and Jonas (2000: 303) argue that some parallels are evident in the UK \nwhere as part of the rescaling of the state, the national government has \u201eexplicitly \ndevolved environmental responsibilities downwards\u201f through, for example, their \nemphasis on local authorities and Local Agenda 21 (LA21) as a key means of \nresponding to the internationally agreed Agenda 21. At a general level, they suggest the \nrescaling of environmental governance \u201ecould well be indicative of struggles to \nreregulate local and regional economies in the wake of the regulatory crises of \nFordism\u201f, though the specifics of such struggles will vary with regional context (Gibbs \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 26 \nand Jonas 2001: 271). Whether the rescaling of environmental governance can be \nexplained in terms of the same dynamic which has underpinned discussions of the \npolitics of scale and the state in the wake of economic restructuring is moot. First, \nwhether the emergence of the discourses and practices of local and urban sustainability, \nas witnessed by LA21, various initiatives sponsored by the European Commission, \nnational governments, subnational authorities, and a wide range of non-state actors, can \nbe read primarily as a response to the need to provide a balance to capital accumulation \nis debatable. For some, strategies for urban sustainability represent an alternative to, \nrather than the regulation of, the neoliberal economic project. Granted, some such \nalternatives \u2013 witness \u201csmart growth\u201d (Portney 2003: 101) and the \u201cnew urbanism\u201d \n(Zimmerman 2001) \u2013 may not be much of an alternative, while others signal an attempt \nto gain a competitive edge through the promotion of green technologies or places to \nwork, and yet more could be conceived as radical attempts to regulate the side effects of \neconomic growth, for example, the recent congestion charge introduced in London. \nHowever, some, such as Local Economic Trading Schemes, or struggles over particular \nsites of development (new roads, mines, nuclear facilities and so on), seek to recast \neconomic development in a different light (Owens 2004).  \n \nSecond, while moves towards urban sustainability may be provoked by a legitimation \ncrisis in the state, it is equally clear that this dynamic has not been primarily \norchestrated by the nation-state. While moves to enhance urban sustainability have been \npresent within various international arenas since the 1970s, it was the conjunction of the \n1987 Brundtland Report, subsequent EU initiatives and the 1992 United Nations \nConference on Environment and Development, which gave the concept significant \nimpetus and legitimacy (Whitehead 2003). These initiatives were supported by various \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 27 \nnon-state and quasi-state organisations, such as the ICLEI, and by local authorities and \ncommunity groups, many of whom had been experimenting with and implementing \nurban sustainability in advance of these international shifts. Chapter 28 of Agenda 21, \nLA21, acted as a focal point for these ideas and networks, and in turn provoked action \nwithin and between local authorities, as well as at the national level through dedicated \nresources and programmes for those subnational authorities who are following this \ninternational agenda. While nation-states have played a role in creating and \norchestrating LA21, given the central roles of local authorities, international institutions \nand non-state actors in its creation and reproduction, it can not be considered as a \n(nation) state strategy through which to devolve environmental regulation per se, though \nit may be used as such by some states. This suggests that the rescaling and rearticulation \nof the state is not only occurring in the economic realm and can not be reduced to \nconsiderations of the accumulation and regulation of capital alone.  \n \nOne alternative reading of the rescaling of environmental governance can be found in \nthe work of Cowell (2003) on the scalar politics of environmental compensation in \nCardiff Bay. Cowell argues that not only do \u201erelations of ecological and political scale \nframe the \u201cdecision space\u201d\u201f (2003: 343) within which compensation takes place, and \nhence the flexibility for reconciling competing objectives, but also that in the process of \n\u201cjumping scales\u201d, so that the spaces of engagement (Cox 1998) surrounding a particular \nissue are rescaled by enrolling actors at a \u201chigher\u201d scale, the objects of governance are \nin themselves transformed. In a similar vein, Boyle (2002) has examined the politics of \nscale surrounding waste management in Ireland, and finds that the relational rescaling \nof waste between European, national and local scales of governance has led to the \ndeployment of a regional scalar strategy for waste management by the central \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 28 \ngovernment, which in turn favours end-of-pipe solutions such as \u201esuper-dumps\u201f and \nthermal treatment facilities. For Cowell (2003: 355) and Boyle (2002: 191), \u201ethe scaling \nof environmental governance \u2026 makes a material difference to the kinds of \ntransformations of nature that occur\u201f, whether it be in how environmental compensation \nis conceived or how, and with what social and environmental implications, waste is \nmanaged. Gibbs and Jonas (2001: 284) suggest that \u201ethe regionalisation of \nenvironmental policy in England is an uneven and immature process\u201f, with the material \nimplications uncertain. These three cases point to the importance of scale politics \nshaping both the institutions and objects of environmental governance, and illustrate \nhow such processes do not take place within a pre-given scalar structure, but are rather \nconstitutive of the construction of particular scalar fixes and particular environmental \noutcomes.  \n \n \nCONFIGURING A NEW SPATIAL GRAMMAR OF ENVIRONMENTAL \nGOVERNANCE \n \nAccounts of the rescaling of environmental governance have predominantly focused on \nthe ways in which, through different networks of actors, the rescaling of environmental \nproblems and their solutions has taken place between territorially delimited arenas of \ngovernance. This section considers how such approaches may be applied in the context \nof emerging network governance arrangements, using the example of TMN\n5\n. It is \nargued that, given that the CCP programme involves recasting a \u201eglobal\u201f environmental \nproblem in a \u201elocal\u201f light, insights from the scale debate provide a useful starting point \nfor considering the configurations of environmental governance to which such networks \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 29 \ngive rise. The analysis of the CCP programme suggests that, in contrast to the \nconventional accounts discussed above, a new \u201espatial grammar\u201f6 of global \nenvironmental governance is taking shape through the re-scaling of the state in relation \nto climate change and through the creation of new spheres of authority within which \nclimate change is being governed.  \n \nThe CCP Programme and the Politics of Scaling Climate Change  \n \nCities have been at the heart of debates about the new politics of scale. Analyses of \nglobal city-regions have documented how places such as Tokyo, London and New York \nhave become drivers of the world economy (Brenner 1998a, 1998b; Scott 2001; \nSwyngedouw and Baeten 2001). Attention has also been directed to the regional scale \nas an arena through which economic development is increasingly orchestrated and \npromoted (MacLeod 2001), and to the role of subnational governments in regulating \nglobal capital (Paul 2002). Such shifts are frequently viewed as part of a state-based \n\u201eaccumulation strategy\u201f, \u201ethrough which cities throughout the world economy are being \npromoted by their host states as locational nodes for transnational capital investment\u201f \n(Brenner 1998b: 3). At the same time, \u201ethe pressure to create more competitive \neconomic structures coincides with a more prominent role of local or regional forms of \ngovernance\u201f (Swyngedouw and Baeten 2001: 831). Cities are considered critical to the \npolitics of scale because they function both as nodes of capital accumulation and as co-\nordinates of state territorial power (Brenner 1998b). Through processes of rescaling the \n(nation) state directs subnational political economies in pursuit of global capital. Others \npoint, however, to the importance of political and economic dynamics within cities and \nregions, crystallised in urban regimes or policy networks (Gibbs and Jonas 2000; \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 30 \nMacLeod 2001; MacLeod and Goodwin 1999; Paul 2002; Swyngedouw and Baeten \n2001), or to everyday practices and competing narratives in scaling cities\/regions \u201efrom \nbelow\u201f (Holm Nielsen and Simonsen 2003). Despite differences in argument, an \nemerging consensus suggests that processes of rescaling are recasting the role of cities \nand regions in the global economy and relations within state space. \n \nHowever, two criticisms can be levelled at this analysis. The first, is that in adopting a \nscalar account of urban politics and state space there is a danger that the internal \ncoherence and territorial contiguousness of \u201ethe city\u201f, and its agency, is taken for \ngranted in ways which do not allow for the \u201eterritorial perforation associated with \nglobalisation\u201f nor the multiple constituencies and distanciated relations which comprise \ncities as nodes in relational networks (Amin 2004: 33; see also Amin 2002; Painter \n1999; Smith 2003). However, as argued above, in the main the discussion on the politics \nof scale takes into account the networked nature of \u201curban\u201d processes and politics, \nsuggesting that this criticism is over-stated. Perhaps more problematically, the emphasis \nhas been on the ways in which the politics of re-scaling leads to increasing competition \nbetween cities, with little acknowledgement of how new forms of co-operation between \ncities, albeit with their own geographies of power and exclusion (Leitner and Shepperd \n2002), are emerging, and the ways in which the re-scaling of the state is taking shape \noutside arenas directly connected to projects of economic liberalisation.  \n \nThe CCP programme is one example of this alternative politics of scaling. Formed in \n1993 by the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), it \ncurrently has over 600 members, accounting for over 8% of global greenhouse gas \nemissions. The network comprises an international secretariat in Toronto, Canada, with \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 31 \nregional campaigns in Australia, Africa, Europe, and South America, as well as national \ncampaigns in Australia, America, Canada, Italy, Mexico, the Philippines and the UK. In \njoining the CCP network, members commit to passing through five milestones: \nconducting an energy and emissions inventory and forecast; establishing an emissions \nreduction target; developing a local action plan to achieve this goal; implementing \npolicies and measures to this end; and undertaking processes of monitoring and \nverifying results.  ICLEI provides local authorities with technical assistance and training \nto complete these milestones, through, for example, giving local authorities software \nspecifically designed to profile urban emissions of greenhouse gases, and aims to raise \nawareness amongst local politicians and civil servants through workshops, training \nevents and the exchange of best practice. The use of the milestone approach and the \ncomplementary software is also seen to be critical in terms of enhancing local \naccountability. By monitoring and reporting on the effects of their activities, it is argued \nthat CCP members can see the results of their efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas \nemissions, persuade others of their effectiveness and the additional benefits \u2013 in terms \nof air quality or improving urban liveability \u2013 that they might bring. At the heart of the \nnetwork is the argument that \u201eglobal\u201f climate change is a \u201elocal\u201f issue: \n \nIf there is to be success in addressing the issue of climate change, then the \nreduction of GHG emissions must also be addressed at the local level. Most of \nthe measures utilized by local governments to reduce GHG emissions also \naddress concerns that dominate most municipal agendas. The Cites for Climate \nProtection\nTM\n (CCP) Campaign methodology results in local governments \nchoosing GHG emissions reduction measures that bring such co-benefits as: \nfinancial savings through energy and fuel efficiency; green space preservation; \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 32 \nlocal economic development and job creation through the demand for energy \nefficiency and new energy systems; air pollution reduction; traffic congestion \nimprovements; community livability improvement (ICLEI CCP 2004).   \n \nThe CCP seeks both to rescale climate change as an issue with local causes and \nconsequences, while at the same time reframing issues which are institutionalized and \nimagined as local \u2013 traffic congestion, green space \u2013 as having global dimensions. This \ndiscursive process of rescaling climate change takes place within the Secretariat through \ntheir lobbying of the international negotiations and promulgation of the CCP storyline \n(Hajer 1995), by officers within municipalities seeking recognition and resources and \nby sponsors of the network, such as the European Commission and various national \ngovernments, who seek to enroll local institutions and actors in mitigating climate \nchange (Betsill 2001; Bulkeley and Betsill 2003). In seeking to draw the global-local \nrelations of climate change, this discursive rescaling elevates local institutions and \npractices as an arena of influence and reduces the roles of international and national \nscales of governance. Such processes of rescaling do not only take discursive form in \nthe CCP programme, but have a material dimension. At the international climate change \nnegotiations, the CCP network represents local ambitions and achievements in the area \nof climate protection, highlighting the role of local authorities in addressing climate \nchange, which most nation-states fail do not do despite a requirement in the reporting \nprocedures for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. By \nregulating and representing municipalities, the CCP bypasses the nation-state and gives \nlocal authorities the opportunity to take a position that may go against that of their \nnational governments (as in the case of Australia and the US). Nonetheless, states have \nnot been absent from the politics of scale engendered in the CCP. The US, Canadian \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 33 \nand Australian governments contribute significant financial resources to their national \nCCP programs and the US Agency for International Development financed pilot \nprojects to establish the national campaigns in India, Mexico, the Philippines and South \nAfrica. Likewise, the European Commission has provided direct funding to ICLEI \nEurope, and indirectly creates resource opportunities for transnational networks through \ncompetitive bidding procedures for particular projects or initiatives (Betsill and \nBulkeley 2003). Moreover, the extent to which the knowledge, norms and resources \ngenerated through the CCP programme have been put to effect locally is in part \ndependent on the powers of municipalities, which are in turn reflective the politics of \nlocal governance, of central-local government relations, and the extent to which local \ngovernments, or other actors, are able to \u201eoutflank\u201f (Fairbrass and Jordan 2001) the \nnation-state in pursuit of their political aims and ambitions, through, for example, direct \nrelations with supranational institutions, such as the European Commission (Bulkeley \nand Betsill 2003).  \n \nThe CCP programme is one example of an arena within which a complex, contested and \nnever complete politics of scale is emerging which is not driven primarily by responses \nto economic globalisation and consequent state restructuring. Here, the politics of scale \ninvolves attempts to reframe an issue which is usually considered in global terms within \npractices and institutions which are circumscribed as local, attempts by state and non-\nstate actors to rehierarchize the relations between different levels of governance in \nrelation to climate change, contests over the appropriate scope and reach of municipal \ngovernments, and conflicts over how climate change considerations should be taken \ninto account in the arenas of housing, land-use, transport etc. which are primarily \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 34 \ngoverned within hierarchical relations between the local and central state (Bulkeley and \nBetsill 2003; Cowell and Murdoch 1999).  \n \nNew Spheres of Environmental Governance \n \nThe CCP programme is not only engaged in rescaling relations between existing and \nemerging scalar constructs and institutions, but is also creating a new \u201esphere of \nauthority\u201f (Rosenau 1997) within which the governance of climate change is taking \nshape. Several commentators have documented the increasing importance of new \n\u201ehorizontal\u201f arenas of governance in the form of policy networks (Borzel 1998; Kohler-\nKoch and Eising 1999; Marsh 1998) and as part of multilevel governance (Bulkeley et \nal. 2003; Fairbrass and Jordan 2001; Hooghe and Marks 2001). In relation to debates on \nthe re-scaling of the state, several terms have been used to describe such new arenas, \nfrom the more or less territorially based \u201enew state spaces\u201f (Brenner 1998b) and \u201enewly \nconfigured territorial political spheres\u201f (MacLeod and Goodwin 2003), to \u201espaces of \nengagement\u201f (Cox 1998) and \u201enew political spaces\u201f (Leitner and Sheppard 2002) which \nsignify more networked forms of organisation. For example, Leitner and Sheppard \n(2002: 500) suggest in their account of inter-urban networks in Europe that:  \n \n\u201ecities and regions can further empower themselves, relative both to mobile \nfinancial capital and the hierarchical power structures of territorial states, by \njoining interurban networks \u2026 Cities in competition with one another are \neasier targets for capital than are interurban collaborative networks, and \nnetworks transcending the boundaries of political territories create new \npolitical spaces for challenging existing territorial state structures.\u201f  \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 35 \n \nIn their analysis, despite the role of the Commission and, in this case, the German \ngovernment, in structuring and maintaining municipal networks, Leitner and Sheppard \n(2002: 511) suggest that networks do afford \u201eopportunities for participating cities to \nstrengthen their power and authority vis-\u00e0-vis the national and supranational scales.\u201f \nHowever, in this perspective, while municipal networks are part of the process and \noutcome of the \u201ehollowing out\u201f of the state, and may create new political spaces through \nwhich cities can act, the scales through which political authority and social relations are \nconstructed and conducted remain nested and hierarchical. An alternative view of such \nnetworks is to conceptualise them as part of a polycentric system of multilevel or multi-\nscalar governance (Betsill and Bulkeley 2004; Bulkeley et al. 2003; Hooghe and Marks \n2001). As Sassen (2003: 11) has recently argued,  \n \n\u201ean important feature of this type of multi-scalar politics of the local is that it is \nnot confined to moving through a set of nested scales from the local to the \nnational to the international, but can directly access other such local actors \nwhether in the same country or across borders.\u201f  \n \nIn this view, transnational municipal networks could be understood as a type of cross-\nborder network which does not operate across existing scales, but which serve to \ndestablise \u201eolder hierarchies of scale and conceptions of nested scalings\u201f (Sassen \n2003:3) by constituting a new sphere of authority which is not defined or contained by \nreference to a particular territory. The CCP programme illustrates this in two ways. \nFirst, as well as being engaged in the complex relations of governance with \ninternational institutions, states, and local governments described above, the CCP \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 36 \nprogramme is to an extent \u201eself-governing\u201f. Municipalities in the CCP programme \nundertake emissions monitoring and modeling in line with protocols established within \nthe network, and report on progress with targets and projects to the network which \nbenchmarks and rewards progress. Through such practices a new \u201eauthority\u201f for \ngoverning climate change has been established which does not reside at any particular \nscale, or in any particular territory. Second, the governing practices of particular \nmembers of the network are not confined to the municipality within which they are \ninitiated. Two examples serve to illustrate this process.  \n \nNewcastle, Australia, was instrumental in establishing the CCP programme nationally, \nand has since played a significant role in its development. Commissioned to undertake \nvarious initiatives by the Australian Greenhouse Office (a federal government \ndepartment) for the CCP programme, Newcastle\u201fs approach to addressing energy \nefficiency and green energy has been disseminated via workshops, a road show, and \npublications to the majority of participants in the CCP-Australia progamme. Among the \nleading local authorities in Australia in 2002 (as defined by their completion of \nMilestone 5), Newcastle was frequently mentioned as a source of inspiration, practical \nknowledge, ideas and support. Through their role in training other local authority \nofficers and disseminating good practice, Newcastle have been instrumental in creating \nnorms about the role of local government in climate protection as well as policy goals \nand practices. In this way, local government officers in Newcastle have effectively had \na role in shaping how the governance of climate protection takes place across Australia. \nSimilarly, Denver, Colorado is typically recognized as the model for the Green Fleets \nprogramme, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from municipal vehicles, \nwhich has since been adopted by a number of CCP communities around the world. In \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 37 \nFebruary 2000, a representative of Denver\u201fs Green Fleets committee traveled to \nBangkok to advise officials there as they developed their own programme, and the \ninitiative has also been adopted by other ICLEI-US participants both through direct \ncontact with officials in Denver and through use of the best practice case-studies \ndisseminated through the CCP programme. This is not to argue that the respective \ninfluence of Newcastle or Denver has been the only or even most important factor \nshaping the governance of climate change across different municipalities, but it is to \nsuggest that through the CCP programme the practices, political authority and \nlegitimacy of individual local governments has been stretched beyond the territorial \nborders of their jurisdiction.  \n \nThis account suggests that the CCP programme, and other transboundary and hybrid \nnetworks, are not only engaged in a politics of scale framed in terms of re-scaling \npolitical authority among existing and emergent territorially bound political spaces but \nare engaged in creating a new sphere of political authority. The question then arises as \nto how the spatiality of such arenas can be conceptualised. While it could be argued that \nthe CCP programme is engaged in creating a \u201enew state space\u201f, given that the members \nof the network are municipal governments, the hybrid nature of the network - it engages \nin action akin to state and non-state entities \u2013 suggests that there is more at stake than \nre-scaling state space. Rather, such new governance arrangements \u201eimply a partial \ndisaggregation or \u201eunbundling\u201f and reassignment of powers traditionally thought to be \namong sovereignty\u201fs most essential attributes.\u201f (Karkkainen 2004: 77) to the network. \nHowever, while the CCP programme represents a  \u201eterritorially disintegrated\u201f  (Heeg et \nal. 2003: 143) network, it is neither de-territorial, as if set free from the messy \nintricacies of the politics of particular places, nor non-territorial, as some topological \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 38 \naccounts of networks maintain. The nature of the network \u2013 its norms, practices, \nknowledge and effect \u2013 is conditioned by the politics of particular places (e.g. \nNewcastle, Denver) and its impacts and implications are shaped by political authority \nconstructed, contested and acted through particular territories of governance (e.g. \nplanning regulations, building regulations), which in turn shape network practices and \nexpectations. Rather than considering a politics of scale and a politics of networks as \nmutually incompatible, the CCP programme illustrates how network practices and \nprocesses of re-scaling the state are intimately articulated. Through rendering global \nclimate change local, and local issues global, the CCP programme has been one means \nthrough which the re-scaling of climate change politics has taken place. Through \n\u201etranscending the boundaries of hierarchical modes of governance\u201f, the CCP network \nhas, in some cases, \u201econfront[ed] and disturb[ed] the dominant politics of hierarchical \npower relations within the nation-state\u201f (Leitner et al. 2003: 288). At the same time, in \nseeking to pursue a local politics of climate protection, officers, politicians and \nstakeholders have sought to align their actions both with the global ambitions of the \nnetwork but also with the project of making place in a particular territory, as witnessed \nby the importance of awards, recognition events and benchmarking practices to \nmembers in the network. Here the project of defining and circumscribing a local place \nwithin which local coalitions, and the CCP network, seek to govern emissions of \ngreenhouse gases is part of the project of re-scaling both the object of governance, in \nthis case climate change, and the agents, here a global-local network of actors. That \nsuch attempts are contested by other networks and levels of governance in relation to \nthe particular politics of the issues addressed \u2013 be they transport, planning, or housing, \nfor example \u2013 illustrates how networks are engaged in the politics of scaling and re-\nscaling environmental governance. In the spatial grammar of environmental governance \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 39 \nconfigured by the CCP programme, networks, scales and territories are not alternatives, \nbut are intimately connected in both a politics of scale, and in creating new arenas of \npolitical authority and legitimacy, through which climate change is governed. \n \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe spatialities of environmental governance considered in this paper differ markedly \nfrom the traditional bounded geographies of the nation-state, inter-national relations, \nand non-state actors. The CCP programme is illustrative of the ways in which new \ngeographies of environmental governance are taking shape. On the one hand, the nature, \nauthority and territoriality of the state is being rearticulated and rescaled through the \nnetwork, whilst simultaneously a new networked arena within which climate change is \nbeing governed is emergent. As Sassen (2003: 14) argues, the kind of \u201ecritical \nreconceptualization of the local\u201f which such networks provoke \u201eentails an at least partial \nrejection of the notion that local scales are inevitably part of nested hierarchies of scale \nrunning from the local to the regional, the national, the international. Localities or local \npractices can constitute multiscalar system \u2013 operating across scales\u201f. \n \nThis paper has argued that insights from the debate on the politics of scale can provide a \nmeans through which to reconfigure notions of environmental governance which can be \nsimultaneously sensitive to processes of scaling and rescaling the objects and agents of \ngovernance, and the political, social and environmental implications, whilst at the same \ntime engaging with the politics of networks. The reading of the politics of scale offered \nhere entails three key points. First, that notions of scalar hierarchies should not be read \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 40 \nin terms of territorial extent, so that the \u201enational\u201f is always \u201ehigher up\u201f the hierarchy \nthan \u201ethe local\u201f, but rather that the domination and subjugation of particular scales of (in \nthis case) governing arrangements is part and parcel of the processes of scaling and re-\nscaling. This suggests that further work on the politics of scale should pay particular \nattention to the ways in which relations of hierarchy are constituted, constructed and \ncontested. Second, and in a related point, a scalar reading of spatiality is not \nsynonymous with one which is territorially bound. Analyses of the politics of scale are \nconcerned with the processes through which particular scales and scalar relations come \nto be constructed and engaged in particular projects of governing, identity formation, \neconomic development and so on, rather than labouring under the assumption that such \nterritories are necessarily contiguous, bounded and homogenous. This is not to deny the \nimport of territory, both in shaping those claims and in making material differences to \nthe ways in which (in this case), environmental governance takes shape \u2013 witness \nCardiff Bay (Cowell 2003), and Irish waste policy (Boyle 2002). It is, however, to \nsuggest that debates over the politics of scale need to cut loose from territorial moorings \ntoo easily tied to na\u00efve delimitations of scale as discrete units and entities. This requires \nan approach which does not take for granted, nor close off, the boundaries of the city, \nregion, nation, global, local, individual, household and so on.  \n \nThird, in seeking to integrate a politics of scales with a politics of networks, this account \nargues that networks have a scalar dimensions which extends beyond their scope \n(Brenner 2001; Leitner et al. 2002). This suggests that those who are concerned with \nexamining the politics of scale would do well to look beyond traditional spatialities of \ngoverning and regulation which tend to be orchestrated around territorial boundaries, \nand to engage with new political spaces which collect beyond and within this ordering. \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 41 \nMoreover, taken together, these points suggest that scalar and network readings of \nspatiality are not necessarily opposed, but may be mutually constitutive. As the example \nof the CCP programme illustrated, networks are formed through processes of scaling \nand rescaling environmental governance, are instrumental in such endeavours, while \nalso creating new networked arenas through which governing takes place.  \n \nThe approach developed here opens up the analysis of environmental governance so that \nit can move beyond nested hierarchies, the separation of levels of decision-making, and \nthe divisions between territorially bound states and the fluid relations of non-state \nactors. Making space for such an analysis is not just a matter of conceptual significance. \nIt offers a means to develop convincing accounts of the multitude of hybrid governance \narrangements which are currently taking shape through various novel coalitions such as \nThe Climate Group, a \u201eglobal coalition of cities, states, governments and corporates \ncommitted to collaboration to cutting greenhouse gas emissions\u201f,7 and forms of \nmultilevel environmental governance (Fairbrass and Jordan 2001). A new spatial \ngrammar, which makes room for the alternative geographies of scales and networks \nsuggested here, can make such modes of governing central to our understandings of the \npolitics of environmental issues.  \n \n \n \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 42 \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \n \nAdger N, Brown K, Fairbrass J, Jordan A, Paavola J, Rosendo S, Seyfang G.

Given that primarily comprise actors from \nwithin municipal governments and the connotation of connection between separate entities that \u201einter\u201f \ncarries with it, the term \u201etransnational municipal networks\u201f is preferred (Bulkeley et al. 2003).  \n \n2\n Though some argue that to date the analysis of global civil society, and its involvement in global \nenvironmental governance (if conceived as international negotiations), has focused on an \u201eexclusive club\u201f \nof NGOs, which not only disempowers grassroots movements (Ford 2003) but is mistakenly seen as \nrepresentative of \u201ethe public\u201f.  \n \n3\n In a detailed footnote, Brenner argues that his emphasis on the \u201e\u201cverticality\u201d of scalar relations, is not to \ndeny the importance of what might be termed \u201ehorizontal\u201f forms of interscalar interaction and \ninterdependence\u201f (2001: 610) but that these constitute different, mutually constitutive, forms of social \nspatiality. This argument is discussed further below.  \n \n4\n Whether or not this is intended by Brenner (2001), who is often critiqued for an overly structured and \ntop-down view of scale (Marston and Smith 2001; Holm Nielsen and Simonsen 2003), illustrating that the \nfrequent ambiguity surrounding key concepts is one of the key flaws in the debate about the politics of \nscale.  \n \n5\n Given the focus of the paper on environmental governance, and the predominance within these \nliteratures of concepts of networks as either a \u201esocial network\u201f (Painter 2004) or as a form of governance \n(Dicken et al. 2001; Leitner et al. 2002), this example is related to this subset of the network literature.  \n \n6\n The term \u201espatial grammar\u201f is derived from Scott\u201fs phrase \u201ea new social grammar of space\u201f (2001: 814), \nwhich he takes to refer to a new world system. MacLeod and Goodwin (2003: 4) pick up the term \n\u201egrammar of space\u201f to examine the nature of \u201ecity and regional restructuring and the shifting architectures \nReconfiguring environmental governance \n 57 \n                                                                                                                                               \nof state power\u201f. Amin et al. (2003) use the term descriptively to refer to the nature of the distribution of \npower in British politics. Given the multitude of ways in which the term \u201egrammar\u201f might be interpreted \nit is worth stressing that here the term is not meant to connote a rule-based system, but rather to convey a \nsense of the ways in which the different elements which make up the spatiality of contemporary \nprocesses, institutions, identities \u2013 e.g. space, place, scale, network, territory \u2013 are articulated in particular \nmoments to \u201emake sense\u201f of a particular phenomenon. In contrast to traditional approaches to \nconceptualising spatiality, a \u201enew\u201f spatial grammar would include different elements \u2013 e.g. networks, new \npolitical spaces \u2013 and different arrangements \u2013 e.g. horizontal as well as vertical forms of articulation \u2013 \nthrough which socio-spatial relations take shape and convey meaning.     \n \n7\n The Climate Group (2004) \u201eWorld\u201fs leading greenhouse gas reducers meet in Toronto\u201f, Online, \navailable: <http:\/\/www.theclimategroup.org\/440.php> (accessed June 2004) \n"}
