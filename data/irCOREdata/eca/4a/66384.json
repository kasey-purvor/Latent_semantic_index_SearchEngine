In string theory this can be interpreted as a\nstrong coupling limit of the decay of a non-supersymmetric orbifold spacetime with\nlocalized tachyons.\nKeywords: Tachyon condensation, supergravity solutions.\nIn the last few years progress has been achieved in studying string theory in the\npresence of instabilities represented by tachyon fields. The problem is particularly\nwell understood when the tachyons appear in the open string spectrum [1]. In this\ncase gravity can be ignored at weak string coupling and the problem can be studied by\na variety of means including string field theory [2, 3, 4], world-sheet renormalization\ngroup (RG) flow [5] and boundary string field theory [6, 7, 8, 9].\nThe study of closed string tachyon condensation is both more difficult and more\ninteresting. Open string tachyon condensation can be studied in a fixed, often flat,\nspacetime background. In contrast, closed string tachyons couple to other closed\nstring modes, including the graviton, and hence the spacetime geometry itself will\ngenerically change in the decay process.\nIn some cases, closed string tachyons may be localized on defects such as NS5-\nbranes or orbifolds [10]. The localization makes the problem more tractable and\ntachyon condensation in this system has been studied using RG flow [10, 11, 12, 13,\n14], D-brane techniques [10] and duality arguments [15]. What has not been done\nso far is to study this process directly in the supergravity re\u00b4gime by finding time-\ndependent solutions which interpolate between one conical spacetime at early times\nand another one at late times. That is what we shall do in this note.\nThe problem originally considered in [10] involves string propagation on the\norbifold spacetime\nR7,1 \u00d7 R2\/Zn (1)\nThat is, on eight-dimensional Minkowski space times a two-dimensional cone. To\nbe concrete we will consider IIA string theory on such a space. String propagation\non such an orbifold is exactly soluble and one finds tachyonic modes in the twisted\nsector of the orbifold. These correspond to instabilities which are localized at the\nfixed point of the orbifold, that is at the tip of the cone. Any perturbation of the\nsystem which excites the tachyon field should lead to a time-dependent solution of\nstring theory with the solution at late times approaching a new solution of string\ntheory. The full time dependent problem is currently too difficult to solve, so what\nhas been done instead is to replace time dependence with renormalization group flow\nand to then study the corresponding RG equations. One result of these studies is\nthe claim that a Zn orbifold spacetime can decay to a Zn\u2032 spacetime with n\n\u2032 < n,\nthat is to a cone with a smaller deficit angle (with n\u2032 = 1 being the stable case of\nflat space).\nHere we will take a different approach, studying the time-dependent equations\nbut in a low-energy limit. The mass of the tachyons in these theories is typically string\nscale, so there is no consistent approximation in which we keep the tachyon fields\nand ignore other string fields. However we can consider a low-energy supergravity\naction with the tachyon fields simply acting as source terms for the massless fields.\nThe tachyon field will thus provide initial conditions for the massless fields but we\n\u2013 1 \u2013\ncan then study the time-evolution of the massless fields with these initial conditions.\nThe relevant massless fields are the graviton and dilaton. Thus we are led to study\nthe time-dependent equations for gravity coupled to a dilaton field.\nTo get a feel for the problem, we start by deriving a spacetime which consists\nof an expanding shell dividing two regions of differing conical deficits. Any two\nspacetimes can be glued together across a wall, provided the induced metric on\nthe wall is identical in each domain. The energy-momentum of the wall is then\ngiven by the jump in extrinsic curvature via the Israel conditions. In general a wall\ncorresponds to a source, which will require some sort of matter; whether or not this\ncan be achieved with the fields at hand will be addressed presently.\nThus consider the conical spacetime\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 dr2 \u2212 dy2i \u2212 r2(1\u2212\u2206)2d\u03b82 (2)\nHere the yi are coordinates on R\n7 while (r, \u03b8) are polar coordinates for the two-\ndimensional cone. The angular variable, \u03b8, runs from 0 to 2\u03c0 on each side of the wall\nfor agreement of the internal wall metric, so if the deficit angle differs, then clearly\nthe value of r on each side of the wall has to be different in order that g\u03b8\u03b8 be the\nsame. Note that this means r+ \u221d r\u2212.\nWe suppose that the wall has trajectory\nx\u00b5\u00b1(\u03c4) = (t\u00b1(\u03c4), r\u00b1(\u03c4)) (3)\non each side, where t\u02d92\u00b1 \u2212 r\u02d92\u00b1 = 1. This has unit normal\nn\u00b5\u00b1 =\n(\nr\u02d9\u00b1,\u2212t\u02d9\u00b1\n)\n(4)\nwhich gives for the extrinsic curvature\nK\u03c4\u03c4 = r\u00a8\/t\u02d9 , K\u03b8\u03b8 = \u2212t\u02d9r(1\u2212\u2206)2 (5)\nThe energy-momentum of the wall is given by Israel\u2019s equations, Tab = \u03b4Kab\u2212\u03b4Khab,\nand reads:\nT yy = \u2212\nr\u00a8+\nt\u02d9+\n+\nr\u00a8\u2212\nt\u02d9\u2212\n\u2212 t\u02d9+\nr+\n+\nt\u02d9\u2212\nr\u2212\n(6)\nT \u03c4\u03c4 = \u2212\nt\u02d9+\nr+\n+\nt\u02d9\u2212\nr\u2212\n= T yy \u2212 T \u03b8\u03b8 (7)\nSo, for example, if r = vt, t\u02d9 = \u03b3 = 1\/\n\u221a\n1\u2212 v2, and r\u02d9 = v\u03b3. The energy\n-momentum of this boundary is then\nT \u03c4\u03c4 = T\ny\ny = \u2212\n\u03b3+\nr+\n+\n\u03b3\u2212\nr\u2212\n= (\u03b3\u2212(1\u2212\u2206\u2212)\u2212 \u03b3+(1\u2212\u2206+)) [(1\u2212\u2206)r]\u22121 (8)\nT \u03b8\u03b8 = 0 (9)\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nIf we assume that the velocities on each side are the same (which is probably not\nnecessary) then we have\nT \u03c4\u03c4 = T\ny\ny =\n\u03b3\n(1\u2212\u2206r) (\u2206+ \u2212\u2206\u2212) (10)\nAssuming that the exterior conical deficit exceeds the interior one, then this corre-\nsponds to a positive tension brane, but smeared over the \u03b8-direction, as it has no\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8 energy momentum.\nThis corresponds to an expanding region of lower conical deficit spacetime sepa-\nrated from the original spacetime by an expanding shell - a source. Whether or not\nthis can be translated into a genuine solution to low-energy string theory necessitates\nsolving the gravity equations of motion with dilaton source terms. We now show that\nthis is possible in a certain limit of string theory.\nInstead of solving the gravity problem in the low-energy limit of ten-dimensional\nstring theory, that is gravity with a dilaton, we consider an M-theory approach\nusing eleven-dimensional gravity which renders the problem purely geometrical. This\napproach is valid in the strong coupling limit of ten-dimensional IIA string theory.\nWe look for a solution involving only the metric in eleven dimensions, i.e., the\nthree-form potential CABC \u2261 0. We will also set the Kaluza-Klein (KK) gauge field\nto zero, consistent with the RG equations, which can be consistently truncated to\nthose for only the metric and dilaton [10].\nWe take spacetime to be the product of a seven-dimensional Ricci flat manifold\nwith coordinates yi, the M-theory circle with coordinate \u03c8 and radius determined by\nthe dilaton D in the usual way, and a 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime with coordinates\n(t, r, \u03b8). For the latter we consider the most general time-dependent metric with a\nsingle rotational degree of freedom, leading to the ansatz:\nds2 = B2(t, r)\n[\ndt2 \u2212 dr2]\u2212A2(t, r)dy2i \u2212 C2(t, r)d\u03b82 \u2212D2(t, r)d\u03c82 (11)\nThe Ricci curvature of this metric is:\nRyy = \u2212\n1\nB2\n[\n\u2202+\u2202\u2212A\nA\n+ 6\n\u2202+A\u2202\u2212A\nA2\n+\n1\n2\n\u2202+A\nA\n\u2202\u2212(CD)\nCD\n+\n1\n2\n\u2202\u2212A\nA\n\u2202+(CD)\nCD\n]\n(12)\nR\u03b8\u03b8 = \u2212\n1\nB2\n[\n\u2202+\u2202\u2212C\nC\n+\n1\n2\n\u2202+C\nC\n\u2202\u2212(A\n7D)\nA7D\n+\n1\n2\n\u2202\u2212C\nC\n\u2202+(A\n7D)\nA7D\n]\n(13)\nR\u03c8\u03c8 = \u2212\n1\nB2\n[\n\u2202+\u2202\u2212D\nD\n+\n1\n2\n\u2202+D\nD\n\u2202\u2212(A\n7C)\nA7C\n+\n1\n2\n\u2202\u2212D\nD\n\u2202+(A\n7C)\nA7C\n]\n(14)\nRtt =\n1\nB2\n[\n\u22127A\u00a8\nA\n\u2212 C\u00a8\nC\n\u2212 D\u00a8\nD\n+\nB\u2032\nB\n(A7CD)\u2032\nA7CD\n+\nB\u02d9\nB\n(A7CD)\u00b7\nA7CD\n\u2212 \u2202+\u2202\u2212(lnB)\n]\n(15)\nRrr =\n1\nB2\n[\n7\nA\u2032\u2032\nA\n+\nC \u2032\u2032\nC\n+\nD\u2032\u2032\nD\n\u2212 B\n\u2032\nB\n(A7CD)\u2032\nA7CD\n\u2212 B\u02d9\nB\n(A7CD)\u00b7\nA7CD\n\u2212 \u2202+\u2202\u2212(lnB)\n]\n(16)\nRrt = \u2212C\u02d9\n\u2032\nC\n\u2212 D\u02d9\n\u2032\nD\n\u2212 7A\u02d9\n\u2032\nA\n+\nB\u02d9\nB\n(A7CD)\u2032\nA7CD\n+\nB\u2032\nB\n(A7CD)\u00b7\nA7CD\n(17)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nwhere \u2202\u00b1 = \u2202\/\u2202x\u00b1, and x\u00b1 = (t\u00b1 r)\/2.\nAlthough this form of the Ricci tensor does not look particularly illuminating,\nit is possible to rewrite the metric functions to produce instead a set of free and\ninteracting fields [16] (one of which can be identified as the dilaton) by defining:\nlnA =\n\u03c3\n7\n(18)\nlnB = \u03c7\u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 2\u03c6\/3 (19)\nlnD = 2\u03c6\/3 (20)\nC = \u03b1e\u2212\u03c3e\u22122\u03c6\/3 (21)\nThe vacuum equations now reduce to the much simpler form\n\u2202+\u2202\u2212\u03b1 = 0 (22)\n\u2202+\u2202\u2212\u03c6+\n1\n2\n(\n\u2202+\u03c6\n\u2202\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b1\n+ \u2202\u2212\u03c6\n\u2202+\u03b1\n\u03b1\n)\n= 0 (23)\n\u2202+\u2202\u2212\u03c3 +\n1\n2\n(\n\u2202+\u03c3\n\u2202\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b1\n+ \u2202\u2212\u03c3\n\u2202+\u03b1\n\u03b1\n)\n= 0 (24)\n\u2202+\u2202\u2212\u03c7 +\n4\n9\n\u2202+\u03c6\u2202\u2212\u03c6+\n4\n7\n\u2202+\u03c3\u2202\u2212\u03c3 +\n1\n3\n\u2202+\u03c6\u2202\u2212\u03c3 +\n1\n3\n\u2202+\u03c3\u2202\u2212\u03c6 = 0 (25)\n\u22022\u00b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\n+\n8\n9\n(\u2202\u00b1\u03c6)\n2 +\n8\n7\n(\u2202\u00b1\u03c3)\n2 +\n4\n3\n\u2202\u00b1\u03c6\u2202\u00b1\u03c3 \u2212 2\u2202\u00b1\u03c7\u2202\u00b1\u03b1\n\u03b1\n= 0 (26)\nOne way of viewing this redefinition is via a KK reduction over {yi, \u03b8, \u03c8} to two\ndimensions. The free field, \u03b1, represents the overall volume of the internal space,\nwith \u03c6 and \u03c3 representing distortions, or relative volume breathing modes, which\ncouple to \u03b1 via a friction term. \u03c6 is of course the dilaton.\nThis now turns out to be totally prescriptive. Since there are no sources, we can\nsimply make a coordinate choice to fix out the conformal coordinate freedom setting\n\u03b1 \u2261 r (27)\nand then both \u03c6 and \u03c3 satisfy cylindrically symmetric wave equations in 2+1 dimen-\nsions:\n\u03c6\u00a8\u2212 \u03c6\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6\n\u2032\nr\n= 0 = \u03c3\u00a8 \u2212 \u03c3\u2032\u2032 \u2212 \u03c3\n\u2032\nr\n(28)\ngiving\n\u03c7\u2032 = r\n[\n4\n9\n(\u03c6\u02d92 + \u03c6\u20322) +\n4\n7\n(\u03c3\u02d92 + \u03c3\u20322) +\n2\n3\n(\u03c3\u2032\u03c6\u2032 + \u03c6\u02d9 \u03c3\u02d9)\n]\n(29)\n\u03c7\u02d9 = 2r\n[\n4\n9\n\u03c6\u02d9\u03c6\u2032 +\n4\n7\n\u03c3\u02d9\u03c3\u2032 +\n1\n3\n(\u03c3\u2032\u03c6\u02d9+ \u03c6\u2032\u03c3\u02d9)\n]\n(30)\nThese equations have some simple solutions. If we set the dilaton and modulus\nof the extra seven dimensions to zero, then \u03c7 is obviously also a constant. Choosing\n\u2013 4 \u2013\n\u03c7 = 0 gives flat spacetime. Choosing \u03c7 6= 0 results in a conical spacetime, with\ndeficit\n\u2206 = 2\u03c0(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03c70) (31)\nWe now want to find a solution which is of this form for r > t, and has a form for\nr < t which is asymptotic to a different conical spacetime for r \u226a t. For simplicity\nwe suppose that the extra y-dimensions in the string frame are inert i.e., A = D\u22121\/2\nor \u03c3 = \u22127\u03c6\/3. This gives\n\u03c7\u2032 = 2r\n(\n\u03c6\u02d92 + \u03c6\u20322\n)\n(32)\n\u03c7\u02d9 = 4r\u03c6\u02d9\u03c6\u2032 (33)\nThe general cylindrically symmetric solution to the wave equation (28) with\ninitial data \u03c6(0, r) = U(r), \u03c6\u02d9(0, r) = V (r) is\n\u03c6(~r, t) =\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u222b\n|~r\u2212~r\u2032|\u2264t\nV (r\u2032)d2r\u2032\u221a\nt2 \u2212 |~r \u2212 ~r\u2032|2 +\n1\n2\u03c0\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\u222b\n|~r\u2212~r\u2032|\u2264t\nU(r\u2032)d2r\u2032\u221a\nt2 \u2212 |~r \u2212 ~r\u2032|2 (34)\nThis shows that for a general dilaton wave, while the wavefront can be largely\nclustered around the future lightcone, there will nonetheless be a tail inside the\nfuture light cone, slowly settling down to a vacuum solution. This is shown in figure\n1 where, for illustrative purposes, we take U(r) = 0 and V (r) = e\u2212r\n2\n. Furthermore,\nif U(r) and V (r) are localized near the origin, then (34) shows that at late times\nthe fluctuations of the dilaton field disperse to infinity with the the dilaton decaying\nback to its original value as 1\/t. This is shown in figure 2 for the same U and V\nas figure 1. Thus the decay process of the conical spacetime does not change the\nvalue of the string coupling constant and hence can be studied consistently at strong\ncoupling.\nFinally, a general result relating the two deficit angles is obtained by integrating\nthe \u03c7\u2032 equation (29). Integrating out from r = 0 we find that the right hand side is\npositive definite, independently of the precise form of \u03c6 and \u03c3. Thus \u03c7 will always\nbe bigger at larger r than at r = 0. In other words, geometry mandates the decay of\nlarger deficits into smaller deficits as has been found in other analyses of this problem\n[10, 11].\nIt would be interesting to interpret our results in terms of the change in Bondi\nenergy. For a static conical spacetime the Bondi energy is proportional to the deficit\nangle. Our result on the decrease of the deficit angle under time evolution is sugges-\ntive of the decrease of Bondi energy with time in four-dimensional Einstein gravity\n[17]. In our case the outgoing energy would be carried away by the dilaton pulse\nrather than by gravitational radiation. However to our knowledge such an analysis\nhas not been done in (2+1)-dimensional dilaton gravity, and indeed the usual analy-\nsis of asymptotic flatness is quite different in odd spacetime dimensions [18].

Our results, which apply at strong string coupling,\nare consistent with previous results based on RG flow and D-brane probe analysis\nand show that these results can in part be understood purely in gravitational terms.\nIt would be interesting to extend this analysis to higher dimensions, in particular to\nthe orbifolds C2\/Zn(p) which were studied in [10, 11]. As might be expected from the\nsubtleties in the world-sheet analysis, this case is also much more complicated from\nthe space-time point of view.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to acknowledge the Aspen Center for Physics where most of this work\nwas done.
