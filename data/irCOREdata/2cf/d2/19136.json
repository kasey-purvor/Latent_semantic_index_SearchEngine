(J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2009, 20, 2238\u20132247) \u00a9 2009 American\nSociety for Mass SpectrometryPolyphosphoesters (PPEs) are polymers that con-tain repeated phosphoester bonds in the back-bone and which are well-suited for numerous\nbiological and pharmaceutical applications [1, 2]. They\nare particularly attractive for drug and gene delivery,\nand tissue engineering [3\u201310] due to their chemical\nproperties and biocompatibility. PPEs are characterized\nby structural versatility\u2014the result of pentavalent\nphosphorus atoms in the backbone\u2014enabling modifi-\ncation of their physicochemical properties and intro-\nduction of bioactive molecules [1, 6, 11]. Even small\nvariations in the structure of polyphosphoesters can\ndramatically influence their interactions with biological\nsystems [5].\nOne of the important features of PPEs, which enables\ntheir use for biomedical applications, is biodegradabil-\nity. PPEs biodegrade through hydrolysis, and possibly\nenzymatic digestion, of phosphate bonds under physi-\nologic conditions [2, 12]. The in vitro degradation\nbehavior of PPEs has been characterized by monitoring\nchanges in mass by gel permeation chromatography [1].\nHowever, information regarding overall molecular\nweight change is insufficient if the PPE is to be consid-\nered for drug or gene delivery. A PPE can only be\napplied as such if all its degradation products and their\nproperties, such as cytotoxicity, are known.

Similarly, the rate of degradation of the polymer\nmust be physiologically suitable for the application.\nAs the performance of PPEs in biomedical applica-\ntions depends on their properties, there is a need for fast\nand simple techniques for characterization of the poly-\nmer structure, its purity, and the products of degrada-\ntion. Mass spectrometry is a valuable tool for the\ncharacterization of chemical polymers [14], providing\ninformation about the molecular weight distribution of\npolymers, and their structural and elemental composi-\ntion [15]. Simonsick and Petkovska [16] reported de-\ntailed structural elucidation of polyesters and acrylates\nby use of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance\n(FT-ICR) mass spectrometry. FT-ICR mass spectrometry\nwas also used by Cerda and coworkers [17] for sequenc-\ning specific copolymer oligomers by electron capture\ndissociation (ECD) and examining the fragmentation\nbehavior of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) ions by both\ncollision-induced dissociation (CID) and ECD [18]. Pre-\nvious work in our laboratory, and others, demonstrated\nthe suitability of FT-ICR with ECD and CID for the\ncharacterization of dendrimers [19\u201321].\nAlthough mass spectrometry has been widely used\nfor the characterization of many different types of\npolymers, so far, characterization of polyphosphoesters\nhas been achieved solely by nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography\n(GPC), and high-performance liquid chromatography\n(HPLC) methods [1]. Zhao and coworkers studied the\nin vitro and in vivo degradation of a poly(lactide-co-\nethylphosphate) copolymer, the bulk of which was\nPDLA [poly(D,L-lactide)], using gel permeation chro-\nmatography, 1H and 31P NMR weight loss measure-\nPublished online August 27, 2009\nr Inc.

Their\nresults indicated a two stage degradation of the PPE: In\nthe first (fast) stage, degradation predominantly occurs\nat the phosphate\u2013lactide bonds with minor degradation\nat phosphate\u2013ethoxy bonds. In the second (slower)\nstage, hydrolysis of the PDLA occurred.\nHere, we present the FT-ICR mass spectrometry and\ntandem mass spectrometry (CID and ECD) of the polypho-\nsphoester poly[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate-alt-\nethyloxyphosphate], see Scheme 1. The results show that\nthis PPE degrades either during storage in air or in the\nsolvent conditions used here. Clearly, the solvent condi-\ntions here (chloroform\/methanol\/water) do not reflect\nthe environment experienced by a polyphosphoester de-\nlivering a drug in the human body. Nevertheless, we\nshow that mass spectrometry analysis provides valuable\ninformation about the polyphosphoester structures and\nenables determination of the degradation pathways of the\nPPE. Three degradation pathways were observed: hydro-\nlysis of the phosphate\u2013[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate]\nbonds; hydrolysis of the phosphate-ethoxy bonds; and\nhydrolysis of the ethyl\u2013terephthalate bonds. The domi-\nnant degradation reactions were those that involved the\nphosphate groups. A comprehensive time-course study of\nthe degradation profile of the PPE is beyond the scope of\nthis paper; however we demonstrate the suitability of the\ncombination of high mass accuracy FT-ICR mass spec-\ntrometry, CID, and ECD, for the structural analysis of\npolyphosphoesters and their degradation products.\nExperimental\nSample Preparation\nPoly[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate-alt-ethyloxyphosph\nate] was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset,\nUK) and used without further purification. The polypho-\nsphoester was dissolved in chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich\nCo., St. Louis, MO, USA) and diluted to a concentration of\n\u000110 pmol\/\u0001L in methanol (FisherScientific, Loughbor-\nough, UK) and acetic acid (FisherScientific) (30:70:2, vol\/\nvol).\nTo promote cationization of poly[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)\nterephthalate-alt-ethyloxyphosphate], sodium iodide\n(Fluka Chemie AG., Buchs, Switzerland), used without\nfurther purification, and dissolved in water (J. T. Baker,\nDeventer, Holland), was added to the electrospray\nsolution for ECD and CID of doubly-charged ions. The\nfinal electrospray solution for these experiments con-\ntained: polyphosphoester dissolved in chloroform, NaI\nScheme 1.

The concentration of the polyphosphoester\nin the final electrospray mix was \u000110 pmol\/\u0001L. The\nmolar ratio of polyphosphoester to NaI was \u00011:1.\nMass Spectrometry\nAll mass spectrometry experiments were performed on\na Thermo Finnigan LTQ FT mass spectrometer (Thermo\nFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). The Advion Bio-\nsciences Triversa Nanomate electrospray source (Advion\nBiosciences, Ithaca, NY, USA) was used to introduce\nsamples to the mass spectrometer.

Mass spectra in all experiments\n(MS andMS\/MS) were acquired at a resolution of 100 000\nat m\/z 400.\nECD. The ions of desired m\/z value were selected and\nisolated in the linear ion trap and transmitted to the ICR\ncell for ECD. Isolation width for ions of interest was 10\nm\/z. Automatic gain control (AGC) was used to accu-\nmulate sufficient precursor ions (target value 1 \u0002 106).\nElectrons were generated on the surface of an indirectly\nheated barium tungsten cylindrical dispenser cathode\n(Heat Wave Labs, Inc, Watsonville, CA). The current\nacross the electrode was \u00011.1 A. Precursor ions were\nirradiated with electrons for 70 ms.\nCID. All CID experiments were performed in the\nfront-end linear ion trap and the fragments transferred\nto the ICR cell for detection. Isolation width was 10 m\/z.\nAGC target value was 1 \u0002 106. Helium gas at a normal-\nized collision energy of 35% was used for all CID\nexperiments.\nAll the MS and MS\/MS spectra were averaged over\n30 scans and analyzed manually. Each ECD and CID\nscan consisted of five co-added microscans.\nResults and Discussion\nPoly[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate-alt-ethyloxyphosph\nate] is a water-insoluble, biodegradable polymer. Electro-\nspray ionization of poly[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate-\nalt-ethyloxyphosphate], (Scheme 1), in chloroform\/\nmethanol\/acetic acid solution, leads to the formation of\npredominantly singly-charged ions. The mass spectrum\nis shown in Figure 1a.\nThe proposed structures of the ions, in order of increas-\ningm\/z ratio, are shown in Scheme 2. Degradation product\nassignments were made on the basis of accurate mass\nmeasurement and CID of singly-charged ions (see below),\nand verified by comparison of observed and expected\nisotope patterns.

In the first region, from about m\/z 550 to\n650 (denoted 1xP), only those species containing a\nsingle phosphate group were detected. Detailed assign-\nments for this part of the mass spectrum are shown in\nFigure 1b. The most abundant peak (m\/zmeas 599.1544,\nm\/zcalc 599.1530) corresponds to a singly-charged ion\ncontaining a phosphate group (loss of C2H4 from ethy-\nloxyphosphate group). The structure of this ion is\nshown in Scheme 2 (denoted I). Species I appears to be\nformed as a result of hydrolysis of the phosphate\u2013[1,4-\nbis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate] bond (route 1 in Scheme\n3) and the phosphate\u2013-ethoxy bond (route 2 in Scheme 3)\nin the PPE. Similar degradation pathways have been\nreported for poly(lactide-co-ethylphosphate) [22]. The\npeak observed at m\/z 581.1436 (m\/zcalc 581.1424) corre-\nsponds to the loss of a water molecule from I. The water\nmolecule could be subtracted from either end of I, and\nthe peak may correspond to populations of both struc-\ntures, however there is no peak corresponding to the\nloss of two water molecules from I. The peak observed\nat m\/z 555.1281 (m\/zcalc 555.1268) can be assigned to one\nof two degradation product ions formed either by\ndegradation pathway 3 combined with degradation\npathway 1 or degradation pathway 1 combined with\ndegradation pathway 3 (see Scheme 3). Both structures\nare possible, and we are not able on the basis of this\nexperiment to clarify which structure is observed. It\nmay be possible to differentiate between the two byMS3\nor nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\nThe peak at m\/z 621.1365 (m\/zcalc 621.1349) corresponds\nto sodiated I.\nThe CID mass spectrum of protonated I ((m\/zmeas\nScheme 3. Degradation pathways of poly[1,4-b599.1544, m\/zcalc 599.1530) is shown in Figure 2a. Pro-posed structures are shown. The most abundant peak at\nm\/z 237.0756 (m\/zcalc 237.0763) can be assigned to a\nfragment ion formed as a result of a six-center pericyclic\nreaction. The complementary fragment, with additional\nwater loss, is observed at m\/z 345.0732 (m\/zcalc 345.0739).\nThe minor signal at m\/z 581.1414 (m\/zcalc 581.1424) can\nbe assigned to loss of one molecule of water from\nthe precursor ion. The peak at m\/z 211.0312 (m\/zcalc\n211.0371) can be assigned to a fragment ion formed as a\nresult of two processes; cleavage between the phenyl\nand carbonyl group in the hydroxyethylterephthalate\nand a six-center pericyclic reaction.\nThe second region of the mass spectrum of the PPE\n(denoted 2xP in Figure 1a), m\/z 650 to \u00011000, shows\npeaks corresponding to species containing two phos-\nphate groups. As might be expected, the number of\nobserved species is much higher than for the 1xP\nregion. PPE degradation products containing two phos-\nphate groups, one phosphate and one ethyloxyphos-\nphate group, and two ethyloxyphosphate groups are\nobserved, e.g., species II (see Scheme 2) at m\/z 679.1213\n(m\/zcalc 679.1193), IV where the precise location of the\nethyloxyphosphate group is unknown, at m\/z 707.1529\n(m\/zcalc 707.1506), and V at m\/z 735.1843 (m\/zcalc 735.1819),\nrespectively. Furthermore, degradation product ions\ncontaining two identical phosphate\/ethyloxyphosphate\ngroups can differ by the location along the backbone of\nthese groups. For example, the peak at m\/z 929.2077\ncorresponds to species VI (m\/zcalc 929.2034) in which\nboth phosphate groups are internal, whereas the peak\natm\/z 679.1213 corresponds to species II in which one of\nthe phosphate groups is situated at the terminus. The\ndegradation products VI and II both arise via degrada-\ndroxyethyl)terephthalate-alt-ethyloxyphosphate].tion pathway 1 (Scheme 3). Often, the precise connec-\n2243J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2009, 20, 2238\u20132247 FT-ICR OF POLYPHOSPHOESTERStivity of the observed PPE degradation products is\nunknown; for example, the intense signal at m\/z\n943.2231 (m\/zcalc 943.2191) could be assigned to a species\nwith two phosphate groups and a methoxy group\n(\u0003OCH3 from the solvent) at one end of the polymer\nfragment; species VII shown in Scheme 2 represents\none potential structure.\nThe region of the mass spectrum from m\/z 650 to 750,\nshown in Figure 1c, nicely illustrates the diversity of the\nsimplest degradation products containing two phos-\nphate groups. The base peak at m\/zmeas 689.1419 (m\/zcalc\n689.1400) can be assigned to the singly-charged species\nFigure 2. CID FT-ICR mass spectra of (a) sing\nasterisk) and (b) singly-protonated III ions.III (see Scheme 2), which contains one ethyloxyphos-phate and one phosphate group. CID of III (see below)\nsuggests that the ethyloxyphosphate group is located at\nthe terminus of the polymer. Species III is the result of\ndegradation at the phosphate\u2013[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)\nterephthalate] and phosphate\u2013ethoxy bonds (routes 1\nand 2 in Scheme 3), with additional loss of a water\nmolecule. The hydrated analogue of III is observed at\nm\/z 707.1529 (species IV, discussed above). Polyphos-\nphoester species with two phosphate groups and two\nethyloxyphosphate groups are also observed; II and V\nrespectively. The minor peak at m\/z 751.1793 (m\/zcalc\n751.1768), assigned as XII, deserves special attention\notonated I ions (artefacts are denoted with anly-prbecause it is the combined result of three different\n2244 KACZOROWSKA AND COOPER J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2009, 20, 2238\u20132247degradation pathways. First, there is hydrolysis of the\nphosphate\u2013[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate] bond\n(route 1 in Scheme 3). Second, there is reduction of the\nethyloxyphosphate (route 2 in Scheme 3). Finally, there\nis hydrolysis of the ethyl\u2013terephthalate bond as shown\nin route 3, Scheme 3. The phosphate group is not\ninvolved in that degradation reaction.\nThe CID mass spectrum of protonated polyphos-\nphoester III is shown in Figure 2b. The spectrum is\ndominated by a peak at m\/z 661.1051 (m\/zcalc 661.1088),\nwhich is the result of loss of C2H4, presumably from the\nethyloxyphosphate group of the precursor ion. The\npeak at m\/z 633.0757 (m\/zcalc 633.0774) is the result of\nloss of two molecules of C2H4 from the precursor ion.\nCleavage of the ethyloxyphosphate\u2013[1,4-bis(hydroxy-\nethyl)terephthalate] bond leads to loss of the neutral\nfragment: [{P(O)2}OCH2CH3], forming the fragment ion\nobserved at m\/z 581.1417 (m\/zcalc 581.1424). This frag-\nmentation process suggests that the ethyloxyphosphate\ngroup is located at the terminus of polyphosphoester\nfragment III. The equivalent fragment in which the\nethyloxyphosphate group is centrally located is not\nobserved. However, the peak atm\/z 581may arise through\nloss of C2H4 separate to terephthalate\u2013phosphate cleav-\nage. The peak at m\/z 537.1151 (m\/zcalc 537.1162) can be\nassigned to a fragment ion containing a centrally-\nlocated phosphate group. That fragment is likely the\nresult of a six-center pericyclic reaction; loss of neutral\nfragment: [CH2\u0004CH-O-{P(O)(OCH2CH3)}\u0003OH] from\nthe precursor ion occurs. Alternatively, the fragment\nmay be the result of two cleavages; one at the ethyloxy-\nphosphate-[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate] bond\n(with loss of the ethyloxyphosphate group), and a\nsecond between the oxygen atom and CH2\u0004CH\u0003\ngroup (with loss of C2H2). The fragment ion of m\/z\n509.0850 is the result of loss of C2H4 from the ion of m\/z\n537.\nThe third region of the mass spectrum of poly[1,4-\nbis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate-alt-ethyloxyphosphate]\nfrom m\/z 1000 to\u00011350 (denoted 3xP in Figure 1a) shows\nPPE species containing three phosphate\/ethyloxyphos-\nphate groups. The most intense signal at m\/z 1287.2908\n(m\/zcalc 1287.2852) can be assigned to the species IX (see\nFigure 1a, Scheme 2) containing two phosphate groups\nand one ethyloxyphosphate group. The precise location of\nthe ethyloxyphosphate group is unknown. As for the 2xP\nregion, the 3xP region comprises a variety of different\ndegradation products, which aremainly the result of hydro-\nlysis at phosphate\u2013[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate]\nbonds, together with phosphate, ethyloxyphosphate,\nand mixed phosphate\/ethyloxyphosphate groups\n(routes 1 and 2 in Scheme 3).\nThe most intense peaks in the fourth region of the\nmass spectrum (denoted 4xP in Figure 1a) occur at m\/z\n1395.2827 and 1367.2561, and can be assigned to species\ncontaining two phosphate groups and two ethyloxy-\nphosphate groups ((m\/zcalc 1395.2827), and three phos-\nphate groups and one ethyloxyphosphate group (m\/zcalc\n1367.2514), respectively. The species containing fourphosphate groups is also observed (m\/zmeas 1339.2272,\nm\/zcalc 1339.2203), however species containing four ethy-\nloxyphosphate groups are not.\nThe results of mass spectrometry experiments\nperformed for [1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate-\nalt-ethyloxyphosphate] suggests that degradation of\nthis polymer occurs mainly at the phosphate\u2013[1,4-bis\n(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate] and phosphate-ethoxy\nbonds (routes 1 and 2 in Scheme 3).

However, some of the deg-\nradation products are solely the result of cleavage at\nphosphate\u2013[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate] bonds\n(route 1, Scheme 3). Minor products of degradation\nprocesses in which phosphate groups were not in-\nvolved were also observed.\nAs described, electrospray ionization of chloro-\nform\/methanol solutions of poly[1,4-bis(hydroxyethyl)\nterephthalate-alt-ethyloxyphosphate] results in the forma-\ntion of singly-charged ions. To promote cationization of\nthe polyphosphoester, sodium iodide, dissolved in water,\nwas added to the electrospray solution. The mass spec-\ntrum, shown in Figure 3a, is dominated by singly-sodiated\nions analogous to those seen for protonated [1,4-bis\n(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate-alt-ethyloxyphosphate] (Figure\n1a). Additionally, doubly-charged ions, comprising di-\nsodiated polyphosphoester species containing a mix-\nture of phosphate\/ethyloxyphosphate groups, were ob-\nserved. No doubly-charged species containing one\nsodium cation and one proton were observed. The\nstructure of the simplest doubly-charged ion observed:\n[XIII \u0005 2Na]2\u0005, which contains one ethyloxyphosphate\nand two phosphate groups, is shown in Scheme 4. The\nresults of the CID and ECD experiments described\nbelow suggest that the ethyloxyphosphate group is\nlocated between the phosphate groups in the polypho-\nsphoester backbone. Other doubly-charged ions (de-\nnoted *, Figure 3a) containing ethyloxyphosphate and\nphosphate groups, in various stoichiometries, were also\nobserved. For example, species XIV (see Figure 3a,\nScheme 4) contains two phosphate groups and two\nethyloxyphosphate groups. Species XV contains two\nethyloxyphosphate groups and three phosphate groups\n(Scheme 4). For all the doubly-charged polyphos-\nScheme 4. Structures of disodiated degradatio\nlate-alt-ethyloxyphosphate].phoester ions observed, the number of phosphate\ngroups exceeded that of ethyloxyphosphate groups.\nThat observation can be explained on the basis of the\nstability of the degradation products; hydrolysis of\nphosphate\u2013ethoxy bonds leads to formation of phos-\nphate diesters, which are more stable than phosphate\ntriesters [1]. Doubly-charged PPE ions containing up\nto seven ethyloxyphosphate\/phosphate groups were\nobserved.\nThe CID MS\/MS spectrum obtained for [XIII \u0005\n2Na]2\u0005 precursor ions is shown in Figure 3b. The\nfragments observed are summarized in Table 1 and\nillustrated in Scheme 5. The most abundant peak at m\/z\n1095.1749 corresponds to [XIII \u0003 A \u0005 2Na-H]\u0005 ions.\nThe complementary ion, [A \u0005 H]\u0005, is present in the\nMS\/MS spectrum at m\/z 237.0756. The spectrum also\nshows peaks corresponding to singly-charged [B \u0005\nNa]\u0005 and [D \u0005 H]\u0005 fragments, and their complemen-\ntary fragments, at m\/z 385.0656, 581.1412, 947.1894,\n751.1129, respectively. Fragments deriving from loss of\nneutral A, B, and D from precursor [XIII\u0005 2Na]2\u0005were\nnot observed. CID cleavage of type A and B, i.e.,\ncleavages between carbon atoms, followed by hydrogen\ntransfer (six center pericyclic reactions), was also ob-\nserved for singly-protonated I and IIIwhereas cleavage\nof type D, i.e., cleavage of the CH2\u2013O bond adjacent to\nthe phosphate group, was not. Unlike CID of the\nsingly-protonated species, CID of the disodiated species\nprovided additional information in the form of comple-\nmentary fragments.\nThe ECD MS\/MS spectrum of [XIII \u0005 2Na]2\u0005 is\nshown in Figure 3c. The fragments observed are sum-\nmarized in Table 2 and illustrated in Scheme 5. As\ntypically observed in ECD, the MS\/MS spectrum is\ndominated by the peak corresponding to the precursor\noducts of poly[1,4 bis(hydroxyethyl)terephtha-n pr\n2246 KACZOROWSKA AND COOPER J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2009, 20, 2238\u20132247ion (m\/z 666.1279). The peak at m\/z 1332.2581 corre-\nsponds to the charge-reduced precursor [XIII \u0005\n2Na]\u0005\u2022. Fragments corresponding to loss of neutral A\nand D (see Scheme 5, Table 2) from the charge-reduced\nprecursor ions are observed; peaks at m\/z 1095.1813 and\n751.1141, respectively. One complementary fragment\nion was observed; [A\u0005H]\u0005 at m\/z 237.0757. To confirm\nthat fragmentation was not due to coincidental CID, we\nperformed the experiment with zero electron energy.\nNo fragments were observed. The most abundant prod-\nuct of electron capture is observed at m\/z 943.1569 and\ncorresponds to an internal fragment (labeled E in\nScheme 5) originating from cleavage of two CH2\u2013O\nbonds adjacent to terephthalate groups. The peak ob-\nserved at m\/z 1287.2242 also corresponds to a fragment\narising through cleavage of the CH2\u2013O bond adjacent to\nthe terminal terephthalate group, labeled F in Scheme 5.\nCleavage of these bonds was not observed following\nCID, however similar fragmentation behavior has been\nreported for ECD of cyclodepsipeptides [23]. Peaks\nobserved at m\/z 193.0494 and 1139.2103 correspond to\nfragments arising through cleavage of the C(O)\u2013O bond\nin the terminal terephthalate group (labeled G in\nScheme 5).

Finally, the peak at m\/z 735.1195 corre-\nsponds to a fragment arising through cleavage of a P\u2013O\nbond in the phosphate group (labeled K in Scheme 5).\nSuch fragmentation behavior is in stark contrast to that\nobserved in the ECD of phosphopeptides. ECD of\nphosphopeptides does not result in cleavage within the\nphosphate [24, 25].\nConclusions\nThe results show that FT-ICR mass spectrometry may\nbe successfully applied to the characterization of polypho-\nsphoesters and their degradation products. The findings\nsuggest that degradation of the polyphosphoester poly[1,4-\nbis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate-alt-ethyloxyphosphate] oc-\ncurs mainly via hydrolysis of the phosphate\u2013[1,4-\nbis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate] and phosphate\u2013ethoxy\nbonds. Minor degradation processes in which ethyloxy-\nphosphate groups were not involved was also observed.\nCID of both singly-protonated and disodiated PPE ions\nand ECD of disodiated degradation product\nTable 2.
