INTRODUCTION \n \nTransmultiplexers are important in multimedia signal \nprocessing and communication systems because several \ndata signals can be transmitted through a single channel by \nusing time division multiplexing or frequency division \nmultiplexing techniques [1]-[7]. The design of uniform \ntransmultiplexers can be found in [1]-[5]. Since the design \nof uniform transmultiplexers can be based on the design of \nuniform filter banks, the existing theory for the design of \nuniform filter banks are adequate and there are many \ndesign methods available for the uniform filter banks \n[1]-[5]. So there are not many difficulties on the design of \nuniform transmultiplexers and they work very well in \nmany applications. \nConsider a specific situation, that is, when different \nbandwidths are allocated for different applications in the \nsame channel. For example, a broader bandwidth is \nrequired for the transmission of videos, while a narrower \nbandwidth is required for transmitting texts. For another \nexample, it may be necessary to allocate more resources to \nthe more critical transmission applications, such as those \nfor the military and medical purposes, while less resources \nare allocated to the less critical applications, such as those \nfor the entertainments. For a further example, resources of \nthe bandwidth can be allocated according to the rates that \nthe consumers afford. All of these circumstances can be \nmodeled as nonuniform transmultiplexers. The design of \nnonuniform transmultiplexers is actually based on the \ndesign of nonuniform filter banks [6]-[7]. However, when \nthe set of decimation integers is incompatible, there will be \nonly one nonzero element in at least one row of the \naliasing matrix of the corresponding filter bank system. \nThis structural dependency and the incompatibility cannot \nbe eliminated by using a set of linear time\uf02dinvariant (LTI) \nfilters and a set of simple samplers [8]-[9]. Hence, the \nnonuniform transmultiplexers are suffered from amplitude, \nphase, aliasing and crosstalk distortions and an exact \nperfect reconstruction cannot be achieved [8]-[9]. \nSome researchers formulate the nonuniform \ntransmultiplexer design problem as an unconstrained \noptimization problem such that the transmultiplexer is as \nclose as possible to an exact perfect reconstruction system \n[7]. Although the unconstrained optimization problem can \nbe solved easily, constraints are often necessary to be \nimposed for real practical situations. For example, as noise \nis always presented in the transmultiplexer, the filters with \ngood frequency selectivity are required and the passband \nand stopband specifications for the individual filters are \ncommonly imposed. Besides formulating the perfect \nreconstruction error as a cost function, another common \nway is to formulate as constraints [10]. This is because the \ncost function may not be convex if perfect reconstruction \nerror is formulated as cost [11]. Moreover, amplitude and \naliasing distortions may be particularly serious at certain \nfrequency bands, instead of evenly distributed over the \nwhole frequency spectrum [10]. Hence, by formulating the \nperfect reconstruction distortion as constraints, excessive \namplitude and aliasing distortions at certain frequency \nbands can be avoided [10]. \nSince all the specifications are expressed as continuous \nconstraints in the frequency domain, this optimization \nproblem is actually a semi-infinite programming problem. \nTo tackle a semi-infinite programming problem, one way \nis to approximate it as a finite dimensional problem \nthrough a discretization of the index set of the continuous \nconstraints [12]. However, there is, in general, no \nguarantee that the continuous constraints will be satisfied \nin between these discretization points [10]. Besides, \nalthough the design problem can be converted into a \nsemi-definite programming problem via a set of linear \nmatrix inequalities (LMI) [13], there is no guarantee that \nthe design procedure will converge to the global minimum \n[11]. Furthermore, as no constraints on the frequency \nselectivity of the individual filters are imposed, the \nfrequency characteristics of the filters may become \nundesirable [13]. \nIn order to avoid the above problems, we propose to solve \nthe problem via the dual parameterization approach, which \nwas developed recently in [10]. Based on the design of the \noptimum nonuniform filter bank [10], the theory and \nalgorithm can be applied to solve this nonuniform \ntransmultiplexer design problem. Subject to some \nsmoothness and convexity conditions on the objective and \nconstraint functions, the convergence of this algorithm to \nthe global minimum is guaranteed. Moreover, this \nalgorithm is very efficient and effective when it is applied \nto the design of certain types of filters. Hence, in this paper, \nwe apply this technique to solve an optimum nonuniform \ntransmultiplexer design problem so that the sum of the \nripple energy for all the individual filters are minimized, \nsubject to the specifications on the amplitude and aliasing \ndistortions and to the passband and stopband specifications \nfor the individual filters. \nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give \nthe notations and definitions that appear throughout this \npaper. In Section 3, we formulate the nonuniform \ntransmultiplexer design problem as a quadratic \nsemi-infinite programming problem. In Section 4, a design \nexample is presented. Finally, we summarize and conclude \nour works in Section 5. \n \n2. NOTATIONS AND DEFINITIONS \n \nLet xi[n] and yi[n], for i=0,1,\uf0bc,N-1, be, respectively, the \ninput and output signals of the nonuniform \ntransmultiplexer as shown in Figure 1.

It is well known that if the \ncorresponding nonuniform filter bank system achieves \nperfect reconstruction with the delay of the whole system \nequals an integer multiple of N, then the corresponding \ntransmultiplexer achieves perfect reconstruction. Hence, \nwe can analyze the nonuniform transmultiplexer via the \ncorresponding nonuniform filter bank system.

DESIGN EXAMPLES \n \nConsider a three\u2013channel nonuniform transmultiplexer \nwith the set of decimation integers being {2,4,4}. Let the \ntransition bandwidths of the lowpass, bandpass and \nhighpass filters be, respectively, 0.2751, 0.2751 and 0.1375. \nDefine the specifications on both the real and imaginary \nparts of the amplitude distortion be -46.5028dB, and that \nof the aliasing distortion be -77.2041dB. Let the \nspecifications on the passband ripples of the lowpass, \nbandpass and highpass filters be, respectively, -55.3910dB, \n-52.7654dB and -55.9176dB; and that of the stopband \nspecifications be -35dB. According to our simulation, the \nglobal minimum which satisfies the required specifications \nis obtained. Figure 2 shows the distortions of the \ncorresponding nonuniform filter bank system designed by \nboth our proposed method and the method without \nconsidering the constraints. \n \n5. CONCLUSION \n \nThe main contribution of this paper is to solve a \nnonuniform FIR transmultiplexer design problem as a \nsemi-infinite programming problem. The method is based \non the dual parameterization technique. One of the \nadvantages of this method is the guaranteed convergence \nof the algorithm to the global minimum that satisfies the \npassband and stopband specifications and meets the \namplitude and aliasing requirements if the solution exists. \nIt also avoids the problems occurred in the existing \nsemi-definite programming approaches, where the \nfrequency responses of the filters obtained may be \nundesirable [13], or the continuous constraints may not be \nsatisfied in between the discretization points [12]. The \nconvergence property of our algorithm only requires that \nthe orders of the filters are sufficiently large and the set of \ndecimation integers is compatible. From our simulation \nresults, we observe that if divergence is encountered, the \nindication is that the solution may not exist for the chosen \nset of filters. One may need to increase the orders of the \nindividual filters or relax some other constraints and repeat \nthe design process until the solution is found. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \n \nThe work obtained in this paper was supported by a \nresearch grant (project number G-YD26) from the Hong \nKong Polytechnic University, and by the Centre for \nMultimedia Signal Processing, The Hong Kong \nPolytechnic University, as well as the CRGC grant (project \nnumber PolyU 5105\\01E) from the Research Grants \nCouncil of Hong Kong. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] R.D.
