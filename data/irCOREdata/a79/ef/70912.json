The\nLLBL contains a mixture of magnetosheath and magneto-\nspheric plasma populations and it is adjacent to the mag-\nnetopause inside the magnetosphere [e.g., Haerendel et al.,\n1978; Eastman and Hones, 1979; Paschmann, 1979; Keyser\net al., 2005]. The thickness of this layer is variable, and it\nwas shown that this boundary layer becomes thicker under\nnorthward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions\n[Eastman and Hones, 1979]. A statistical study showed that\nthe boundary layer was observed in 90% of magnetopause\ncrossings [Eastman et al., 1996]. Outside the magneto-\npause, the magnetosheath boundary layer (MSBL) is also\noften detected [e.g., Fuselier et al., 1997]. This boundary\nlayer is populated by the mixture of pristine magnetosheath\nplasma, leaking magnetospheric plasma and heated magne-\ntosheath plasma which was heated at the magnetopause\ncurrent layer and mirrored from low altitudes [e.g., Onsager\net al., 2001].\n[3] The LLBL plays an important role in the coupling\nbetween the solar wind and the magnetosphere. Across this\nboundary layer the energy and momentum from the solar\nwind transfer into the magnetospheric system. The LLBL\nhas been extensively studied during last few decades (see\nAGU monograph Low-Latitude Boundary Layer, published\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A07S07, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012762, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London,\nDorking, UK.\n2Now at Department of Physics, La Trobe University, Melbourne,\nVictoria, Australia.\n3Space Science and Technology Department, Rutherford Appleton\nLaboratory, Didcot, UK.\n4Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, UK.\n5Research and Scientific Support Department, European Space Agency,\nNoordwijk, Netherlands.\n6Centre d\u2019Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements, Centre National de la\nRecherche Scientifique, Toulouse, France.\n7Space and Atmospheric Physics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College\nLondon, London, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JA012762$09.00\nA07S07 1 of 33\nin 2003); however, a number of important questions remain\nunanswered.\n[4] First, the LLBL often exhibits complicated substruc-\nture. For example, Song et al. [1990], based on ISEE-1 data,\nshowed that the LLBL consists of two sublayers. The first\nsublayer, called the outer boundary layer (OBL), is domi-\nnated by magnetosheath particles and the second sublayer,\ncalled the inner boundary layer (IBL), is dominated by the\nmagnetospheric population. Inside the OBL the plasma\ndensity and temperature are almost stable, while across\nthe IBL the plasma temperature strongly increases. In their\nobservations, plasma inside the different layers is homoge-\nneous and sharp boundaries exist between the two layers,\nsuggesting that there is a little diffusion present. In an\nextended study, Song et al. [1993] showed that the structure\nof the boundary layer can be even more complicated and\nthat for some examples, a middle boundary layer is present\nand that slight heating may occur in the boundary layers. In\nthe case of two layers, the ion velocity distribution consists\nof a simple mixture of two populations whose ratio is\nsystematically changing.\n[5] Similar observations of the substructure of the LLBL\nwere presented by Le et al. [1996]. They demonstrated that\ninside the OBL the heated magnetosheath plasma is ob-\nserved with little or no magnetospheric population and\ninside the IBL a mixture of magnetosheath and magneto-\nspheric plasma is observed. Their study was based only on\nthe analysis of ion data. However, signatures in the ion and\nelectron populations inside the outer and inner boundary\nlayers may be different. Vaisberg et al. [2001] observations\nof the weakly structured LLBL during northward IMF are in\nagreement with the observations of Song et al. [1990, 1993]\nand Le et al. [1996]. They demonstrated that the LLBL may\nconsist of two regions, separated by a thin boundary, and\nthat the number density profile is monotonic across the\nsharp boundaries. Vaisberg et al. [2001] also showed that\nthe IBL is a mixture of both populations and that the trapped\nmagnetospheric population is always observed in the inner\nLLBL and may also be observed in the outer LLBL. Bauer\net al. [2001] performed an extended statistical study of the\nouter and inner boundary layers using data from the\nAMPTE\/IRM satellite. They showed that the plasma in\nthe OBL is dominated by solar wind particles and that the\npartial densities of the solar wind and magnetospheric\nparticles are comparable inside the IBL. They also showed\nthat \u2018\u2018warm,\u2019\u2019 counterstreaming electrons that originate\nprimarily from the magnetosheath and have a field-aligned\ntemperature that is higher than the electron temperature in\nthe magnetosheath by a factor of 1\u20135 are characteristic\nfeature of the IBL. These \u2018\u2018warm\u2019\u2019 bidirectional electrons\noverlap with the hot electron populations inside the IBL. In\nthis statistical study, inside the OBL the density plateau is\noften observed and the plasma density exhibits step-like\nprofiles inside the outer and inner boundary layers. One of\nthe important findings from this study is that the step-like\nsubstructure of the LLBL is observed during any orientation\nof the IMF.\n[6] The mechanism for the formation of the boundary\nlayer is also somewhat controversial. There are a few\nmechanisms which can contribute to the plasma transfer\nacross the boundary layer. First, the plasma diffusion may\noccur across the magnetopause. Plasma interaction with\nlower hybrid waves near the magnetopause may lead to\nlocalized field structure and enhanced diffusion rates\nthrough turbulence [e.g., Shapiro et al., 1994]. However,\nin general the diffusion coefficients are not high enough to\nexplain the formation of the LLBL [Treumann et al., 1995].\nRecently, Bauer et al. [2001] estimated the diffusion caused\nby lower hybrid drift instability, gyroresonant pitch angle\nscattering and kinetic Alfven wave turbulence and sug-\ngested that cross-field diffusion cannot transport solar wind\nplasma into the outer and inner boundary layers at a rate that\nwould account for their thicknesses. It was pointed out that\nthe diffusion process cannot explain the OBL formation\nwhere the density plateau is observed, as it predicts gradient\nregions only. Other mechanisms which can be responsible\nfor the formation of the boundary layer are curvature drift,\ngradient B drift, and polarization drift, which must always\ncontribute to the formation of the boundary layer to some\ndegree [e.g., Bauer et al., 2001]. However, it was shown\nthat the estimated drift entry can only give a small contri-\nbution to the LLBL formation [Treumann and Baumjohann,\n1988].\n[7] The other candidate mechanism for the LLBL forma-\ntion involves large-scale waves at the magnetopause: plas-\nma may be transferred across the flank boundary via the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability [Ogilvie and Fitzenreiter,\n1989; Fujimoto and Teresawa, 1995]. Mixing of the plasma\nfrom different sources, magnetosheath and magnetosphere,\nnear the flanks is observed in the presence of the Kelvin-\nHelmholtz waves [Hasegawa et al., 2004] and it has been\nsuggested that localized reconnection can happen inside the\nplasma vortices [Nykyri et al., 2006]. However, the KHI\noccurs at the flank of the magnetosphere and thus this\nprocess cannot explain the observations of the LLBL near\nthe subsolar magnetopause.\n[8] The last formation mechanism involves reconnection\nbetween terrestrial and magnetosheath field lines. During\nsouthward IMF reconnection occurs at the dayside magne-\ntopause [Dungey, 1961] and the LLBL forms due to the\ntime-of-flight effect of the energetic electrons, energetic\nions, and the bulk plasma population accelerated at the\nmagnetopause [Gosling et al., 1990]. During northward\nIMF, reconnection is more likely to occur poleward of the\ncusp region, in the lobe sector [e.g., Dungey, 1963; Crooker,\n1979]. All physically possible reconnection geometries\nduring northward IMF were described by Cowley [1973,\n1983] and include single lobe reconnection, dual lobe\nreconnection, and sequential merging. During single lobe\nreconnection, the IMF field lines reconnect with open\nlobe field lines in one hemisphere [e.g., Milan et al.,\n2000; Frey et al., 2002]. During dual lobe reconnection,\nwhich may occur under strong northward IMF, open field\nlines from both lobes reconnect with part of the magneto-\nsheath field lines, thus creating newly reclosed field lines\nwith captured magnetosheath plasma on them [Song and\nRussell, 1992; Song et al., 2002]. These newly reclosed\nfield lines will sink into the magnetosphere and due to the\ninterchange instability will move antisunward around the\nflanks, thus forming a thick LLBL and cold dense plasma\nsheet, often observed during northward IMF [e.g., \u00d8ieroset\net al., 2005]. The sequential merging process is similar to\ndual lobe reconnection; however, reconnection processes at\nboth hemispheres do not occur simultaneously. Recently,\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n2 of 33\nA07S07\nWatanabe et al. [2006] introduced a new mode of sequential\nand internal reconnection, suggesting that during intervals\nwith northward IMF and significant dipole tilt reconnection\noccurs not only between a summer lobe and a winter lobe\nfield lines but also between a summer lobe field line and a\nclosed field line.\n[9] The Song and Russell mechanism [e.g., Song and\nRussell, 1992] can explain observations of magnetosheath-\nlike plasma inside the LLBL. This mechanism was modified\nby Le et al. [1996] in order to explain observations of both\nthe inner and outer layers of the LLBL. They suggested that\nlobe reconnection in both hemispheres does not happen\nsimultaneously. In their model, the outer boundary layer\nappears to be formed by reconnection between magneto-\nsheath and lobe field lines poleward of one cusp. Thus, it is\non open field lines. The inner boundary layer is identified to\nbe on closed field lines that have become closed by\nreconnection of the open end of the flux tube poleward of\nthe other cusp. The mixture of the magnetosheath and\nmagnetospheric populations inside the inner boundary layer\nwas explained by the drift of hot magnetospheric plasma on\nthese closed field lines, even if the hot plasma was com-\npletely absent when the field lines were open [Mitchell et\nal., 1987].\n[10] In observations reported by Le et al. [1996] there is a\nsubstantial difference in the plasma density of the outer and\ninner boundary layers. In one of the presented events, the\nouter boundary layer (on field lines reconnected once) has\nplasma density \u0001 20 cm\u00023, while in the inner boundary\nlayer (on field lines reconnected twice) the plasma density is\n\u00013\u20134 cm\u00023. Such a big difference in plasma density is in\nagreement with observations by Song et al. [1990, 1993].\nHowever, Onsager et al. [2001] presented Polar observa-\ntions of the high-latitude cusp region and of the MSBL\nduring northward IMF, which they interpreted as evidence\nfor the satellite crossing once- or twice-reconnected field\nlines. In their observations, the differences in the plasma\ndensity on once- and twice-reconnected field lines are\ninsignificant. Similar observations with almost equal plasma\ndensities on field lines reconnected once or twice inside the\nhigh-latitude cusp region were presented in the study by\nBogdanova et al. [2005]. Thus, it is still unclear what\nplasma density variations should be expected inside the\nouter and inner boundary layers.\n[11] There are a few complications in the study of the\nLLBL using satellite data. Inside the magnetosheath bound-\nary layer, the directionality of heated electrons is a good\nindicator of the field topology [Fuselier et al., 1995, 1997;\nOnsager et al., 2001; Onsager and Scudder, 2002] as it\nclearly shows if reconnection occurs in the lobe sector of\none or both hemispheres [Onsager et al., 2001; Lavraud et\nal., 2005; Lavraud et al., 2006]. However, determining the\ntopology of the magnetic field lines inside the LLBL is\nmore difficult as it is hard to distinguish the magnetic field\ntopology based on plasma observations [e.g., Phan et al.,\n1997]. Inside the magnetosphere, trapped magnetospheric\nelectron distributions may indicate a closed topology [e.g.,\nMitchell et al., 1987]. Other evidence of the closed topology\nis the counterstreaming electrons of low (\u000110 eV) and\nmedium energy (50\u2013400 eV) [Ogilvie et al., 1984; Hall et\nal., 1991]. However, it may be relatively easy to create a\ntrapped-like or counterstreaming electron population with\nmagnetosheath energies on open field lines [Fuselier et al.,\n1995]: the approximate balance of a field-aligned electron\nfluxes may also be observed for electrons on open field lines\nthat are mirrored at low altitudes [Fuselier et al., 1997].\nHowever, recently Phan et al. [2005] suggested that equal\nfluxes of the counterstreaming electron population at all\nenergies are a signature of closed field lines inside the\nmagnetosphere. Another convincing signature of closed\ntopology is a presence of counterstreaming oxygen out-\nflowing from both southern and northern hemispheres\n[Fuselier et al., 2001].\n[12] The second complication is related to the definition\nof the magnetopause during northward IMF. According to\nthe basic definition, the magnetopause is the current layer\nwhich separates the magnetospheric and magnetosheath\nplasma. During southward IMF, the magnetopause is easily\nidentified by a major rotation of the magnetic field from the\nlocal magnetosheath to the magnetospheric orientation.\nHowever, under northward IMF, the orientation of both\nmagnetic fields at the dayside will be similar and thus this\nobservational identification becomes hard to perform. The\ndifficulties in the recognition of the magnetopause were\ndiscussed by Paschmann et al. [1993]. They showed that\nunder northward IMF, at the time when plasma temperature\nand distribution function undergo a rapid change there is\nalmost no associated change in the magnetic field. It was\npointed out [Paschmann et al., 1993; Song et al., 1993;\nFuselier et al., 1997] that for northward IMF conditions, the\nsimple definition of the magnetopause as a current layer is\nnot appropriate because there is no current present at a\nboundary separating two distinct magnetized plasmas with\nequal thermal pressure. It was suggested that the magneto-\npause be defined as a topological boundary separating the\nregion in which magnetosheath population is dominant from\nthat with significant presence of magnetospheric and iono-\nspheric populations [Paschmann et al., 1993]. One method\nfor identifying this topological boundary for low magnetic\nshear situation involves the analysis of the electron temper-\nature anisotropy [Paschmann et al., 1993]. Magnetosheath\nelectrons are nearly isotropic, but with T? > TII. However,\nheating at the magnetopause creates the opposite anisotropy,\nwith TII > T? [Paschmann et al., 1993]. The dayside\nmagnetopause during northward IMF may not provide\nconditions to effectively accelerate plasma populations\nobserved inside the LLBL. However, Onsager and Scudder\n[2002] showed that some energization of the plasma pop-\nulations is observed in situ at the high-latitude magneto-\npause where magnetic shear is sufficiently high. This can be\neither as a coherent acceleration, with little change in the\ntemperature of the intermixing plasma components, or as a\nbulk heating [Onsager and Scudder, 2002]. The accelera-\ntion is due to the electric field component tangent to the\nmagnetopause current layer [e.g., Reiff et al., 1977]. The\nheating is observed in both electrons and ions and tends to\nincrease the temperature in the direction parallel to the local\nmagnetic field above that in the perpendicular direction.\n[13] A third complication in the analysis of the boundary\nlayer populations is the large and rapid backward and\nforward motions of the magnetopause and the LLBL. To\nanalyze such cases, Hapgood and Bryant [1990, 1992]\nintroduced the transition parameter (TP) technique for the\nreordering data inside the boundary layer. This is based on\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n3 of 33\nA07S07\nthe clear anticorrelation between electron density and tem-\nperature inside the boundary layer. Using the transition\nparameter, it is possible to reorder plasma and field data\nand remove the effects of the magnetopause and boundary\nlayer motion from the data analysis. Hapgood and Bryant\n[1990] showed that inside the boundary layer there are\nalways two distinct groups of data points: first, the section\nwhere electron density changes rapidly, but energy changes\na little. This is adjacent to the magnetosheath population.\nThe second group is where the energy changes rapidly, but\nthe electron density changes only slowly. This is adjacent\nto the magnetospheric population. In a statistical study,\nHapgood and Bryant [1992] showed that there is a smooth\ntransition between the magnetosphere and magnetosheath\nstates with many points representing plasma states interme-\ndiate between the two extremes if data are reordered\naccording to the transition parameter. In all cases there are\ncontinuous traces between two extreme states without any\nabrupt changes, i.e., discontinuities, in the plasma. These\nobservations gave them a reason to conclude that within the\nboundary layer there is a continuous change in the balance\nof processes controlling the transition between magneto-\nsheath and magnetosphere.\n[14] It is also possible to study the properties of the low-\nlatitude boundary layer using satellite data from the cleft\nand cusp crossings, as magnetic field lines from the LLBL\non the dayside maps into the relatively small area inside the\ncusp and cleft at low altitudes [e.g., Newell and Meng,\n1988, 1992]. Midaltitude cusp crossings have been used to\ninvestigate properties of the electron edge of the LLBL\nduring southward IMF [Bogdanova et al., 2006]. The cusp\nregion is populated by magnetosheath-like plasma which\nenters the magnetosphere via the reconnection process.\nUnder southward IMF, plasma signatures of dayside recon-\nnection in the cusp plasma population include plasma\ninjections near the equatorward boundary of the cusp,\nantisunward convection, and \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 energy-latitude dis-\npersion with the plasma bulk energy decreasing with\nincreasing latitude [e.g., Smith and Lockwood, 1996]. Under\nnorthward IMF, the signatures of plasma injections in the\ncusp from lobe reconnection include injections near the\npoleward boundary of the cusp, reverse, sunward plasma\nconvection, and the opposite energy-latitude dispersion\n[e.g., Crooker, 1992; Fuselier et al., 2000a; Twitty et al.,\n2004]. In addition, it is possible to study dual-lobe recon-\nnection processes using cusp observations [Sandholt et al.,\n2000; Provan et al., 2005; Bogdanova et al., 2005, 2007].\nThe signatures of the dual lobe reconnection in the cusp\nobservations include evidence of the counterstreaming ox-\nygen ions [Fuselier et al., 2001] and an existence of the\nmore accelerated magnetosheath-like plasma [e.g., Onsager\net al., 2001; Bogdanova et al., 2005]. However, some\nsignatures of dual lobe reconnection inside the cusp are\nstill not clear. For example, this process can be accompanied\nby strong sunward convection [e.g., Sandholt et al., 2000;\nProvan et al., 2005; Bogdanova et al., 2007], while other\nstudies argue that plasma on reclosed field lines is nearly\nstagnant [Bogdanova et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2008]. The\nexpected nature of electron distributions is also unclear;\nPhan et al. [2005] suggested that a bidirectional electron\npopulation of the magnetosheath energies with balanced\nfluxes at all energies in the parallel and antiparallel direction\nis a signature of closed field lines. However, almost isotro-\npic electron and ion populations have been observed on\nreclosed field lines inside the cusp [Bogdanova et al., 2005].\nThis isotropization was explained as a result of pitch angle\nscattering. These different pitch angle distributions might be\nexplained by the different \u2018\u2018history\u2019\u2019 of field lines since\nreconnection: on newly closed field lines the population\nmay be more bidirectional but becomes more isotropic with\ntime due to pitch angle scattering.\n[15] Thus, it is of interest to study the reconnection\ngeometry and topology of the magnetic field lines which\npopulated the LLBL near the dayside magnetopause and the\nLLBL(cleft)\/cusp at low latitude during northward IMF\nusing observations from satellites inside the cusp and near\nthe dayside magnetopause. In this paper we present such\nobservations, with Double Star TC1 close to the dayside\nmagnetopause and crossing the LLBL as it moves backward\nand forward while Cluster is located inside the northern\ncleft\/cusp region. We study in detail the structure of the\nLLBL near the subsolar point and the structure of the cusp\/\nLLBL by examining high time resolution (4 s) magnetic\nfield and plasma data. We also take into account the large-\nscale reconnection geometry which is revealed from Super-\nDARN data from both hemispheres.\n[16] Using these simultaneous observations, we try to\nanswer the questions: (1) What is the structure of the\ndifferent sublayers observed inside the LLBL and cusp?\n(2) Can we simply map the LLBL observed near the dayside\nmagnetopause into the cusp region? (3) How does the\nplasma population change as observed inside the LLBL\nnear the magnetopause and inside the cusp at low altitudes?\n(4) How do the observed sublayers form?\n[17] This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a\nbrief description of the Cluster, TC1, and ACE instruments\nused in this study; section 3 presents observations with\nsubsection 3.1 showing the overview of Cluster and TC1\nconjunction orbits and IMF conditions, subsection 3.2\nshowing SuperDARN observations in both hemispheres,\nsubsection 3.3 showing the TC1 observations inside the\ndayside LLBL, and subsection 3.4 presenting the Cluster\nobservations inside the cusp region. Section 4 contains a\ndiscussion and explanation of the observations with subsec-\ntion 4.1 discussing TC1 observations, subsection 4.2 dis-\ncussing Cluster observations and subsection 4.3 presenting\na comparison of Cluster and TC1 observations. Finally, we\npresent our conclusions in section 5.\n2. Cluster, Double Star TC1, and ACE Orbit and\nInstrument Description\n[18] This study is based on observations by the four\nCluster satellites inside the midaltitude cusp region, by the\nDouble Star TC1 satellite near the subsolar magnetopause,\nand by the ACE satellite in the upstream solar wind.\n[19] The Cluster orbit has a perigee of \u00014 RE and an\napogee of \u000119.7 RE, an inclination of \u000190\u0001, and an orbital\nperiod of \u000157 h [Escoubet et al., 2001]. The Cluster\nobservations reported here were acquired by the Plasma\nElectron and Current Experiment (PEACE) [Johnstone et\nal., 1997]. Each PEACE package consists of two sensors,\nHEEA (High Energy Electron Analyzer) and LEEA (Low\nEnergy Electron Analyzer), mounted on diametrically op-\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n4 of 33\nA07S07\nposite sides of the spacecraft. They are designed to measure\nthe 3-D velocity distributions of electrons in the range of\n0.6 eV to \u000126 keV, with a time resolution of 4 s. In addition\nwe used data obtained by the Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and\nComposition and Distribution Function (CODIF) sensors,\nwhich are parts of the Cluster Ion Spectrometry (CIS)\nexperiment [Re`me et al., 2001]. These instruments are\nmounted on each of the Cluster satellites. The CODIF\nsensor combines a top hat analyzer with an instantaneous\n360\u0001 field of view, with a time of flight section to measure\nthe complete 3-D distribution functions of the major ion\nspecies: H+, He++, He+, and O+. The sensor covers the\nenergy range between 0.02 and 38 keV\/q with a time\nresolution of 4 s. The spacecraft potential is measured by\nthe Electric Fields andWaves (EFW) instrument [Gustafsson\net al., 2001]. We also used magnetic field data from the\nFluxgate Magnetometer (FGM) [Balogh et al., 2001] with 4 s\nresolution.\n[20] The Double Star TC1 satellite was launched in 2003\ninto an equatorial orbit at 28.2\u0001 inclination, with a perigee of\n577 km, an apogee of 13.4 RE, and an orbital period of\n27.4 h [Liu et al., 2005]. The orbit of the TC1 satellite is\ncomplimentary to the Cluster orbit, providing many possi-\nbilities for conjugated studies of magnetospheric dynamics.\nSome of the instruments on the TC1 satellite are similar to\nthose on Cluster, and in this study we used data from the\nTC1 PEACE [Fazakerley et al., 2005], CIS [Re`me et al.,\n2005], and FGM [Carr et al., 2005] instruments. The data\nhave been used with spin (4 s) resolution. The TC1 PEACE\ninstrument consists of one sensor, which usually runs in\nalternating sweep preset mode. This means that every spin\nthe sensor will cover different (high and low) energy ranges\nin alternation. The PEACE instrument on the TC1 space-\ncraft has enough telemetry for 3-D data to be available for\nevery spin.\n[21] ACE is orbiting the L1 libration point about\n1.5 million km from the Earth and 148.5 million km from the\nSun. The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) data come\nfrom the Magnetic Field Experiment (MAG) [Smith et al.,\n1998]. The level 2 data with 16-s resolution are used in this\nstudy. The solar wind density and velocity come from the\nSolar Wind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM)\n[McComas et al., 1998]; level 2 data with 64-s time\nresolution are also used. The solar wind dynamic pressure\nis calculated as Psw = Nsw m Vsw\n2 , where Nsw is the solar wind\ndensity measured by ACE, m is a mass of proton, and Vsw is\nthe solar wind velocity measured by ACE.\n[22] The time lag associated with solar wind convection\nbetween the ACE, Cluster, and TC1 observations is calcu-\nlated based on the X-component of the solar wind velocity,\nVXsw, in the GSE coordinate system (measured with a\nresolution of 64 s) and the position of ACE along Sun-\nEarth line (GSE x axis). The time lag is defined as Dt = X\/\nVXsw, where X is the distance from ACE to the center of the\nEarth in the GSE X-direction. In the calculation of the time\nto the center of the Earth, we assume that the time taken for\nthe shocked solar wind plasma to travel from the bow shock\nto the subsolar magnetopause through the magnetosheath is\nroughly equal to time needed for the normal solar wind to\ntravel from the stand-off bow shock distance to the Earth\n(approximately 2\u20133 min [Stubbs et al., 2004]). The appro-\npriate solar wind velocity is calculated as the average\nvelocity over a 20 min period around 45\u201365 min in advance\nof the Cluster and TC1 observations.\n3. Observations\n3.1. Overview of Cluster and TC1 Conjunction and\nIMF Conditions\n[23] Figure 1 shows the Cluster and TC1 orbits during the\ntime of interest, on 28 February 2004, 0000\u20130400 UT. The\nleft plot presents a view of the projection onto the X-Z plane\nand the right plot shows a view of the X-Y plane in the\nGSM coordinate system. The magnetospheric magnetic\nfield lines from the Tsyganenko T96 model are used\n[Tsyganenko, 1995] determined using parameters close to\nthose observed. For Cluster, the tetrahedron configuration is\nshown scaled up by a factor of 20. During the time of\ninterest the Cluster satellites are in the northern hemisphere\nand move from the nightside to the dayside via the mid-\naltitude cusp region. According to the T96 model, Cluster\ncrosses the lobe sector, the cusp proper, and the dayside\nplasma sheet regions. The magnetic local time (MLT) of the\nCluster satellites varies from 0940 at 0000 UT to 1209 at\n0400 UT.\n[24] At the same time, the TC1 satellite is near the\nsubsolar magnetopause, and, according to the model pre-\ndictions, moves from the magnetosheath into the dayside\nplasma sheet. TC1 is close to local noon, with a magnetic\nlocal time of 1234 at 0000 UT and of 1332 at 0400 UT.\nThus, the difference between the Cluster and TC1 positions\nduring the time of interest is in the range of 1\u20132 h of MLT\nwith Cluster being slightly in the dawn sector and TC1\nbeing slightly in the dusk sector. Thus, strictly speaking, the\nsatellites are not on the same field lines. However, they are\nclose to each other in MLT, and the inter-SC MLT differ-\nence (1\u20132 h) is small in comparison with previously\nestimated lengths of the X-line at the magnetopause, 6\u2013\n11 RE [e.g., Chisham et al., 2004]. Thus, in this paper we\nconsider nearly simultaneous measurements from the Clus-\nter and Double Star TC1 spacecraft which might relate to\neach other. The closest predicted conjunction in time\nbetween these satellites is during the period when TC1\ncrosses the magnetopause near the subsolar point and the\nCluster quartet is near the equatorward boundary of the\ncusp, moving from open to closed field lines.\n[25] Figure 2 presents the solar wind and IMF conditions\nmeasured by the ACE satellite for the interval 27 February\n2300 UT to 28 February 0300 UT. The ACE data have been\nshifted according to the estimated time lag of 56 min. The\ntop three panels show the three components of the IMF in\nthe GSM coordinate system. The fourth panel shows the\nIMF clock-angle, CA = tan\u00021(BY\/BZ). The next two panels\nshow the X-component of the solar wind velocity (GSE)\nand the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. The last panel\nshows the magnetopause stand-off distance calculated using\nthe method of Petrinec and Russell [1995].\n[26] During the time of interest the IMF BX component is\nmostly negative and changes from \u00010 nT at the beginning\nto \u000213 nT at the end. The IMF BY component is relatively\nlow and varies around 0 nT in the range of \u00b15 nT. From\n0220 UT BY increases, reaching 8 nT at 0300 UT. For most\nof the interval the IMF BZ component is very strong and\nnorthward, \u000110\u201314 nT. However, from \u00010210 UT, BZ\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n5 of 33\nA07S07\ndecreases and becomes southward at \u00010240 UT. The\ncorresponding clock angle varies within the limits \u00b120\u0001\nuntil \u00010210 UT. At the end of the time of the interest, the\nclock angle increases and reaches 120\u0001 at 0300 UT.\n[27] The solar wind velocity is relatively stable, VX\n\u0001 420 km s\u00021. The dynamic pressure of the solar wind is\nslightly decreasing with time from 3.5 nPa at 2300 UT on\n27 February to \u00012 nPa at 0100 UT on 28 February. From\n0100 UT, the dynamic pressure is relatively stable and\nexhibits small scale variations around an average value of\n\u00012 nPa. The calculated stand-off distance varies in the\nrange 9.5\u201310.5 RE, and, in accord with the solar wind\ndynamic pressure, from 0100 UT exhibits small-scale\nvariations with an amplitude of 0.2 RE around an average\nposition of 10.4 RE.\n[28] Figure 3 presents an overview of the electron data\nfrom the simultaneous observations by the Cluster and\nDouble Star TC1 satellites on 28 February 2004, 0000\u2013\n0340 UT studied in this paper. The first panel shows the\nelectron energy time spectrogram measured at Cluster SC2.\nThe black trace at the bottom of the panel represents the\nspacecraft potential. The second panel presents the electron\nenergy-time spectrogram from TC1. On both panels, omni-\ndirectional differential energy flux (averaged over all pitch\nangles) is color-coded.\n[29] At 0000 UT, SC2 is in the polar cap and detects low\nelectron fluxes. At \u00010035 UT SC2 starts to detect enhanced\nfluxes of a magnetosheath-like electron population and\ncrosses some boundary layer near the poleward edge of\nthe cusp. At 0040 UT SC2 enters the cusp proper,\ncharacterized by a strong enhancement of the fluxes of\nmagnetosheath-like electrons with energies 30\u2013500 eV. At\n\u00010110 UT SC2 enters the boundary layer near the equator-\nward boundary of the cusp. This boundary layer is charac-\nterized by reduced fluxes of the magnetosheath-like\nelectrons and by the appearance of low fluxes of electrons\nwith plasma sheet energies, 1\u201310 keV. At \u00010140 UT SC2\ndetects strong enhancement of the electrons with plasma\nsheet energies; however, until \u00010200 UT, there are still\nsome brief intervals of enhanced electron fluxes at low\nenergies. From \u00010200 UT SC2 enters the dayside plasma\nsheet proper, characterized by an electron population\nwith energy 2\u20135 keV. An additional low-energy popula-\ntion, 10\u201340 eV, is of ionospheric or plasmaspheric origin.\nDuring the time of interest, the Cluster spacecraft separation\nis 200 km and the plasma populations observed by SC1, SC3,\nand SC4 are similar to SC2 during this crossing. The CIS\ninstruments on all Cluster spacecraft have a data gap during\nthe period 0040\u20130130UT. Thus, wewill significantly rely on\nPEACE observations.\n[30] At 0000 UT TC1 is in the magnetosheath proper\ncharacterized by high fluxes of electrons with energies 15\u2013\n200 eV. From \u00010040 UT TC1 enters the plasma depletion\nlayer (PDL) defined by the reduced fluxes and energies of\nthe electron population [e.g., Anderson and Fuselier, 1993].\nDuring the interval 0125\u20130200 UT TC1 crosses the bound-\nary layer, which consists of accelerated magnetosheath\nelectron population with energies 30\u2013600 eV. This compli-\ncated crossing will be discussed in more detail later. At\n0200 UT TC1 begins to detect high fluxes of the plasma\nsheet electron population with energies 1\u201320 keV. Howev-\ner, low fluxes of magnetosheath-like electrons are still\ndetected. Thus, TC1 is inside another boundary layer. The\nenergy of the magnetosheath-like population inside this\nFigure 1. Cluster and TC-1 spacecraft tracks in the X-Z (left) and X-Y (right) plane in the GSM\ncoordinate system between 0000 and 0400 UT on 28 February 2004. The orbit also shows the\nconfiguration of the Cluster spacecraft array as a tetrahedron (scaled by a factor of 20). The model\ngeomagnetic field lines are shown for the projection into the X-Z plane and cut through the magnetopause\nis shown for the X-Y plane. The magnetospheric field lines are shown from the Tsyganenko T96 model\nbased on observed external parameters.\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n6 of 33\nA07S07\nboundary layer is increasing with time. At 0320 UT the\nmagnetosheath-like population disappears and at this time\nTC1 enters the dayside plasma sheet proper. Unfortunately\nthere were some problems with CIS data transmission from\nTC1 during this time interval, and the transmitted CIS data\nare very noisy. Despite this, it is possible to observe ion\npopulations similar to those described above inside different\nregions. However, inside the boundary layer with acceler-\nated magnetosheath electron populations, low fluxes of ions\nwith plasma sheet energies are observed among significant\nfluxes of ions with magnetosheath energies (not shown).\nFigure 2. The IMF and solar wind conditions for the interval 27 February 2300 UT to 28 February\n0300 UT. The top three panels show the X-, Y-, and Z-components of the IMF in the GSM coordinate\nsystem. The fourth panel presents the IMF clock-angle. The last three panels show the X-component of\nthe solar wind velocity in the GSE coordinate system, the dynamic pressure of the solar wind and\nestimated stand-off distance of the magnetopause at the subsolar point. The ACE data have been shifted\naccording to the estimated time lag of 56 min.\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n7 of 33\nA07S07\n[31] The closest conjunction in time between Cluster and\nTC1 is during the period 0125\u20130150 UT. During this time\nCluster is near the poleward boundary of the cusp inside the\nboundary layer, and TC1 is inside the complicated boundary\nlayer which contains an accelerated magnetosheath plasma\npopulation. The MLT difference between these satellites\nduring this period is \u00011 h. We note that as ion data are not\navailable for the most of the time of interest, an analysis and\ninterpretation of observations from the both Cluster and\nTC1 satellites will be based on electron and magnetic field\ndata.\n3.2. SuperDARN Observations in Both Hemispheres\n[32] To estimate large-scale reconnection geometry, we\ninvestigate the ionospheric convection in both hemispheres\nusing data from the Super-Dual Auroral Radar Network\n(SuperDARN) array of coherent scatter radars [Chisham et\nal., 2007]. The SuperDARN radars measure the line-of-\nsight (l-o-s) Doppler velocity, spectral width, and the\nbackscatter power from ionospheric plasma irregularities\nin 16 beam directions separated by 3.24\u0001 in azimuth. A full\nscan is completed in 2 min and covers 52\u0001 in azimuth and\nover 3000 km in range with a resolution of 45 km.\nObservations from different radars may be combined using\nthe \u2018\u2018map potential\u2019\u2019 technique [Ruohoniemi and Baker,\n1998] in order to provide an estimate of the two-dimensional\nconvection pattern in the high-latitude ionosphere. In this\nstudy we use the convection maps reconstructed from\nobservations from nine radars in the northern hemisphere\nand four radars in the southern hemisphere.\n[33] We studied the ionospheric convection at 10 min\nintervals for the period when Cluster crosses the cusp and\nTC1 crosses the boundary layer, 0040\u20130200 UT. Figure 4\npresents a summary showing the convection maps in a\nmagnetic local time\/magnetic latitude coordinate system.\nOn each map, dashed semicircles indicate parallels of\nconstant magnetic latitude at 80\u0001, 70\u0001, and 60\u0001. The radial\nlines indicate hours of magnetic local time with noon\nlocated at the top of the figure. Only the dayside part of\nthe convection map is shown. On each map, locations of\nradar-derived velocity vectors of the ionospheric convection\nare represented by dots. The line attached to each dot\nindicates the convection velocity at that location derived\nby combining a line-of-sight radar measurement and an\northogonal component determined by the map potential\nFigure 3. Overview of the nearly simultaneous observations from Cluster and Double Star TC1 satellite\non 28 February 2004, 0000\u20130340 UT. The first panel shows the electron energy time spectrogram\nmeasured at Cluster SC2. The black line at the bottom of the panel represents the spacecraft potential.\nThe second panel presents the electron energy-time spectrogram from TC1. On both panels,\nomnidirectional differential energy flux (averaged over all anodes) is color-coded.\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n8 of 33\nA07S07\nfitting technique. The magnitude of convection is indicated\nby color and by the length of the line. The black solid and\ndashed lines show equipotential lines which are predicted\nstreamlines of ionospheric convection. The magnetic foot-\nprints of the SC1 and TC1 spacecraft are shown by star-\nshaped and circular symbols, respectively. Footprints are\nderived from the T96 magnetic field model [Tsyganenko,\n1995] parameterized for the observed upstream solar wind\nconditions. The left and right columns show the convection\nmaps in the northern hemisphere and southern hemispheres,\nFigure 4. Streamlines and vectors of the ionospheric convection derived from SuperDARN\nobservations of ionospheric flow in the northern (left column) and southern (right column) hemispheres\nduring 28 February 2004. Convection maps are shown in the geomagnetic grid (MLT, ILAT) for five\nparticular times during the period of interest. The circle and star represent Cluster and TC1 footprints\nrespectively. The direction of the lagged IMF is shown at the center of each subpanel.\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n9 of 33\nA07S07\nrespectively, presented in a common coordinate system as if\nviewed from above the northern magnetic pole. The direc-\ntion of the lagged IMF is shown at the center of each\nsubpanel.\n[34] The first row shows two convection maps at 0040 UT,\nwhen Cluster, in the northern hemisphere, enters the cusp\nregion from the lobes. In the northern hemisphere, there is\na convection cell in the dawn sector, with sunward flow at\n11\u201312 MLT and return flow at lower latitudes. The\npredicted Cluster footprints are around 11 MLT, in the\nregion of convection turning point from sunward to anti-\nsunward directions. In the dusk sector, a large convection\ncell is observed, with sunward convection at low latitudes\nturning to antisunward convection at higher latitudes,\naround 13 MLT. In the southern hemisphere, two-cell\nconvection pattern is observed: there is sunward convection\nat 12 MLT, at the footprint of the cusp, and two return flows\nat lower latitudes in the dusk and dawn sectors. The\nsunward ionospheric convection inside the cusp, at around\n12 MLT, corresponds to plasma injections from the recon-\nnection site which is located poleward of the cusp, in the\nlobe sector. Thus, our observations indicate the existence of\ntwo reconnection sites: one site is in the lobe sector of the\nsouthern hemisphere and the second site is in the lobe sector\nof the northern hemisphere. Moreover, an additional recon-\nnection site might exist at the dusk-lobe sector in the\nnorthern hemisphere. This reconnection site would drive\nthe dusk convection cell in the northern hemisphere.\n[35] The second row shows the convection maps at\n0100 UT, when Cluster is inside the cusp proper and TC1 is\nstill in the magnetosheath. The third row presents convection\nmaps at 0120 UT, when Cluster enters the boundary layer\nnear the equatorward boundary of the cusp and TC1 enters\nthe boundary layer containing the accelerated magneto-\nsheath population. For both intervals, the ionospheric con-\nvection is similar to the convection described above, at\n0040 UT. It indicates that ionospheric convection and thus\nthe reconnection geometry are stable over this period of\n40 min. It is interesting to note that footprints of the Cluster\nspacecraft appear in the southern hemisphere at 0100 UT,\nindicating that according to the T96 model, Cluster is on\nclosed field lines. At 0120 UT the TC1 footprints also\nregisters in the southern hemisphere, again indicating that\naccording the T96 model, TC1 should already be inside the\nmagnetosphere.\n[36] The fourth row presents the convection maps at\n0140 UT, when Cluster is still inside the boundary layer\nnear the equatorward boundary of the cusp and TC1 is\ninside the boundary layer near the subsolar magnetopause.\nIn the northern hemisphere, the observed convection is\nmuch lower than before and almost stagnant: most of the\nconvection vectors are around 100\u2013200 m s\u00021 in compar-\nison with 200\u2013700 m s\u00021 during the previous interval.\nHowever, analysis still reveals two convection cells: one\ncell is in the dawn sector, with sunward, but very low,\nconvection at 12 MLT, and the second convection cell is in\nthe dusk sector. However, the Cluster satellite moves to\nlower latitudes and there are no observations of the plasma\nconvection at the Cluster footprints. In the southern hemi-\nsphere, there are fewer measured convection vectors than\nbefore; however, the two-cell sunward convection pattern is\nstill evident. There are no observations of the convection at\nthe predicted footprints of both Cluster and TC1, which\nmight indicate that both satellites moved out of the region\nwith strong convection.\n[37] The last row shows the convection maps at 0200 UT,\nwhen Cluster enters the dayside plasma sheet and TC1\ncrosses into the boundary layer populated by both plasma\nsheet and magnetosheath populations. In the northern hemi-\nsphere the convection cell at the dawn sector disappears,\nwhich indicates most likely the vanishing of the ionospheric\nplasma irregularities and thus no signal to reconstruct the\nconvection. However, the convection cell at dusk still exists.\nSimilar to the previous time interval, the footprints of both\nCluster and TC1 are equatorward of the region with\nobserved convection. There are only a few convection\nvectors in the southern hemisphere, and they indicate the\nexistence of the sunward convection in the 11\u201312 MLT\nsector.\n3.3. Analysis of the TC1 Observations\n3.3.1. Overview of Boundary Layer Crossing by TC1\n[38] An overview of TC1 observations on 28 February\n2004, 0115\u20130210 UT is presented in Figure 5. Figure 5a\nconsists of 10 subpanels. Each panel presents the pitch\nangle distribution (0\u0001\u2013180\u0001) for electrons with center ener-\ngy shown on the left (in the range 10\u20133800 eV). Differen-\ntial energy flux is color-coded according to the logarithmic\ncolor bar shown on the right. Figures 5b, 5c, and 5d show\nthe electron density, the electron temperature, and the\nanisotropy of the electron temperature, defined as TII\/T?,\nrespectively. Figures 5e, 5f, and 5g present the X-, Y-, and\nZ-components of the plasma (electron) velocity in the GSM\ncoordinate system, respectively. The velocity time series are\naveraged over 40 s to remove short-scale fluctuations.\nFigures 5h\u20135k show the X-, Y-, and Z-components of the\nmagnetic field in the GSM coordinate system and the\nmagnitude of the magnetic field, respectively.\n[39] At 0115 UT TC1 is in the plasma depletion layer,\ncharacterized by a depletion of the plasma density and an\nincrease of the magnetic field strength compared to earlier\nmagnetosheath values. The electron population inside the\nPDL is very anisotropic: the low-energy electron popula-\ntion, E \u0001 14\u201347 eV, moves antiparallel to the local\nmagnetic field and the high-energy electron population, E\n\u0001 85\u2013200 eV, moves parallel to the magnetic field. During\nthe period 0115\u20130125 UT, when inside the PDL, TC1\ndetects a slight decrease of the electron density and very\nlow temperature. The anisotropy of the electron temperature\nvaries between 1 and 1.15. The measured plasma velocity is\nlow, with the X- and Z- components close to zero. The Y-\ncomponent of plasma velocity is around 100\u2013150 km s\u00021.\nThus, the plasma in this region convects from the subsolar\npoint toward the dusk sector. The magnetic field inside the\nPDL is quite strong, the magnitude of the magnetic field is\njBj \u0001 80\u201383 nT. The magnetic field is strongly northward,\nwith the BZ component being \u000180 nT, BX \u0001 13 nT and\nBY \u0001 0 nT.\n[40] At \u00010125 UT TC1 enters the boundary layer, char-\nacterized by energized magnetosheath-like electrons.

The anisotropy\nof the electron temperature varies within the limits 0.95\u2013\n1.15. This crossing is characterized by enhanced variations in\nthe X-component of the plasma velocity, VX\u0001 \u00b1100 km s\u00021,\nby the Y-component of the velocity being similar to that\ninside the PDL, VY\u0001 60\u2013100 km s\u00021, and by an enhanced Z-\ncomponent, VZ\u0001 30\u2013100 km s\u00021. Thus, inside the boundary\nlayer, the plasma moves duskward and northward. There are\nmany small-scale variations in the X- and Y- components of\nthe magnetic field inside this boundary layer, BX varies in\nthe limit \u000113 nT \u00b1 3 nT, however, it stays almost at the\nsame level as that inside the PDL. It is interesting to note\nthat the direction of the X-component inside both PDL and\nboundary layer is in disagreement with that observed at\nACE in the solar wind, changing from antisunward orien-\ntation inside the solar wind to sunward orientation inside\nthe PDL and boundary layer, indicating significant draping\nof field lines inside the PDL. The BY component inside the\nboundary layer is within the limits \u000112 nT \u00b1 5 nT. This\ncomponent increases inside the boundary layer in compar-\nison with the PDL value. When TC1 enters the boundary\nlayer, the major changes happen in the BZ component: BZ\ndecreases from \u000182 nT inside the PDL to \u000167 nT inside\nthe boundary layer. The magnitude of the magnetic field\ninside the boundary layer is \u000170 nT.\n[41] However, as one can see from variations in the\nmagnetic field and electron pitch angle spectrogram, this\nboundary layer crossing during the period 0125:00\u2013\n0158:00 UT is nonuniform. Thus, owing to the small-scale\nmotion of the magnetopause, TC1 reenters the PDL at least\nthree times: during the intervals \u00010131:00\u20130132:00 UT,\n\u00010145:30\u20130146:30 UT, and \u00010154:00\u20130155:30 UT. Each\nof these reenterings into the PDL is characterized by the\nelectron population observed before in the PDL, by the\nreduction of the electron temperature and by the magnetic\nfield values similar to the values observed before, inside the\nPDL. Additionally, analysis of the magnitude and the Z-\ncomponent of the magnetic field shows that TC1 detects\nsimilar values of BZ and jBj to the PDL values during few\nshort intervals at \u00010128:00\u20130131:00 UT, \u00010135:00 UT,\n\u00010137:00 UT, \u00010141:00 UT, and 0142:00\u20130144:00 UT.\nHowever, the electron population during these intervals is\ndifferent to the PDL populations: the energy of the electrons\nvaries in the range E \u0001 18\u20132900 eV, and the population is\nmore bi-directional: there are enhanced fluxes in the parallel\nand antiparallel directions. On the other hand, considering\nthe electron population above 55 eV, one might see that the\nparallel fluxes of electrons are similar to those in the PDL,\nwith antiparallel fluxes in addition. Thus, this population\ncan be considered as a PDL population for the electrons in\nthe parallel direction superimposed with a unidirectional\n(antiparallel) beam-like population. We will call parts of the\nboundary layer with such populations \u2018\u2018boundary sublayer\nwith unidirectional electrons.\u2019\u2019\n[42] Apart from the previously discussed PDL electron\npopulation and population inside the sublayer with unidi-\nrectional electron beams, TC1 detects a third type of\nelectron population inside this boundary layer during the\nintervals \u00010126\u20130128 UT, \u00010132\u20130133 UT, 0133:30\u2013\n0137:30 UT, \u00010145:00 UT, \u00010147:00 UT, \u00010152\u2013\n0154 UT, and \u00010156\u20130158 UT. This electron population\nis characterized by slightly more energetic electrons, by\nbidirectional electrons with energies 31\u2013300 eV (however,\nfluxes of particles at 90\u0001 pitch angle also increase), and by\nsignificant fluxes of electrons with energies 300\u20135000 eV.\nThere is a slight enhancement of electron fluxes at 90\u0001 pitch\nangle for this high-energy part of the electron population.\nThus, these are signatures of mixing of the magnetosheath\nand plasma sheet populations on these field lines. We will\ncall parts of the boundary layer with such populations\n\u2018\u2018boundary sublayer with mixing populations of bidirection-\nal magnetosheath-like electrons and plasma sheet elec-\ntrons.\u2019\u2019 As one can see, there are multiple crossings by\nthe TC1 spacecraft into different sublayers during this\nLLBL crossing, due to variations in the magnetopause\nstand-off distance.\n[43] At 0158 UT, TC1 leaves the boundary layer charac-\nterized by accelerated magnetosheath-like electrons and\nenters into a fourth subcategory of boundary layer, charac-\nterized by a mixture of a plasma sheet-like electron popu-\nlation with enhanced fluxes at 90\u0001 pitch angle and a\nmagnetosheath-like electron population with reduced\nfluxes. It is interesting to note that the low energy part of\nthe magnetosheath-like population inside this boundary\nlayer, E \u0001 14\u201385 eV, is bidirectional, with enhanced fluxes\nat 0 and 180\u0001 pitch angles. However, the high energy part of\nthe magnetosheath-like population, E \u0001 150\u2013500 eV, has\nenhanced fluxes at 90\u0001 pitch angle, i.e., is trapped. This\nboundary layer was observed for 2 min, 0158\u20130200 UT.\nDuring this time, the plasma properties change drastically:\nthe electron density decreases from 9 cm\u00023 to 1\u20130.5 cm\u00023\n(however, for some time, there is a \u2018\u2018plateau\u2019\u2019 in the\ndensity), the electron temperature slowly increases from\n100 eV to 700 eV, and the electron temperature anisotropy\nslowly decreases from 1 to 0.85. The velocity of the plasma\nchanges as well and becomes smaller and stable. The\nmagnetic field becomes more stable and closer to values\nobserved later. We will call this boundary layer the \u2018\u2018tran-\nsition layer.\u2019\u2019 This transition layer is definitely on closed\nfield lines, as indicated by existence of the plasma sheet\ntrapped population.\n[44] After 0200:00 UTTC1 enters the plasma region inside\nthe magnetosphere with very stable plasma and magnetic\nfield properties: the electron density is Ne \u0001 0.1 cm\u00023, the\ntemperature is stable at \u0001600\u2013700 eV, the electron anisot-\nropy is 0.7\u20130.8, and the velocity is steady with low antisun-\nward and duskward components. The magnetic field inside\nthis region is very stable with BX \u0001 15\u201320 nT, BY \u0001 10 nT,\nand BZ \u0001 75 nT. However, this region still could not be\nconsidered as the plasma sheet proper, as it consists of a\nmixture of plasma sheet electron population and magneto-\nsheath electron population, similar to observations inside the\ntransition layer. Thus, we will call this region a \u2018\u2018boundary\nlayer on closed field lines.\u2019\u2019\n[45] To summarize, during the interval 0115\u20130210 UT,\nthe TC1 satellite crosses the complicated structure of back\nand forward moving boundary layers. Analyzing plasma\nand magnetic field data from TC1, we distinguish that TC1\ncrosses six different plasma regions during this time: a\nplasma depletion layer; a boundary layer with unidirectional\nelectron beams, a boundary layer with accelerated magneto-\nsheath-like population, which consists of two sublayers,\nwith unidirectional and bidirectional electron populations\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n12 of 33\nA07S07\n(with heated perpendicular population as well); a transition\nlayer and a boundary layer on closed field lines.\n3.3.2. Reordering of Crossing According to Transition\nParameter\n[46] To remove time variations in the crossing of the\ncomplicated structure of the boundary layers and emphasize\nthe spatial variations, we reorganize data according to the\ntransition parameter, using the \u2018\u2018transition parameter tech-\nnique,\u2019\u2019 introduced by Hapgood and Bryant [1992]. This\ntechnique is based on the anticorrelation between density\nand temperature of electrons inside the boundary layer. The\ntransition parameter technique works well when there is a\nmixture of hot, tenuous plasma with cold, dense plasma,\ni.e., the magnetosphere and magnetosheath plasmas. How-\never, in more complicated situation, when a third population\nis present (for example, an ionospheric population), this\ntechnique does not work. Thus, we carefully analyzed the\nelectron population and removed the ionospheric population\nfrom the transition parameter analysis, calculating the\npartial moments (the electron density and temperature)\ninside the magnetosphere only for the population which\nincludes plasma sheet and magnetosheath electrons.\n[47] We establish the relationship between the electron\ndensity and temperature using scatterplots of log(Ne) versus\nlog(Te). The perpendicular temperature is used for the\nscatterplots. To find the transition parameter, corresponding\nto every observed data point, a best fit curve to the\nscatterplot of the electron density versus electron tempera-\nture during the crossing from the magnetosheath into the\nmagnetosphere is determined. Each data point is then\nprojected onto the curve by finding the point on the curve\nclosest to the data point. Finally, a raw transition parameter\ncorresponding to each data point is calculated by determi-\nnation of the distance along the curve from the projected\npoint to an arbitrary origin beyond the magnetosheath end\nof the distribution. The values of TP are normalized to be in\nthe range from 0 to 100, such that TP = 0 corresponds to the\nmagnetosheath population and TP = 100 corresponds to the\nmagnetospheric population.\n[48] Figure 6 presents two examples of scatter logarithmic\nplots of the electron density versus the electron perpendicular\ntemperature, for the interval 0000\u20130340 UT (top) and the\ninterval 0100\u20130220 UT (bottom). The solid lines on both\nplots represent the least squares fits. On the top plot, the\npopulation with log(Ne) \u0001 1.2\u20131.4 and log(Te) \u0001 1.5\u20131.7\nis the magnetosheath proper population, and the popula-\ntion with log(Ne) \u0001 0.8\u20131.2, and log(Te) \u0001 1.3\u20131.5 is the\nplasma depletion layer population, plasma population\ncharacterized by a depletion in comparison to the magne-\ntosheath. The cluster of points with log(Ne) \u0001 0.8\u20131 and\nlog(Te) \u0001 1.4\u20131.9 corresponds to observations inside the\nboundary layer with accelerated magnetosheath-like plasma.\nAs we remember, inside this boundary layer the density of\nelectrons was similar to the density inside the PDL and the\ntemperature strongly increases. The population with decreas-\ning density, log(Ne) \u0001 0.8\u20130.2, and increasing temperature\nlog(Te) \u0001 1.9\u20132.7, corresponds to the transition layer. Inside\nthis layer, there is true anti-correlation between electron\ndensity and temperature. The cluster of points with low\ndensity, log(Ne) \u0001 0.1\u20130.2, and high temperature, log(Ne)\n\u0001 2.7\u20133, represents the boundary layer on closed field lines\nand the dayside plasma sheet proper. As one can see, there is a\ntendency of increasing temperature and decreasing density\nfrom the magnetosheath population toward the plasma sheet\npopulation. However, the relationship between electron den-\nsity and temperature could not be described as smooth\nanticorrelation, as in the studies of Hapgood and Bryant\n[1992] and Fear et al. [2005a]. Moreover, the transition\nbetween the PDL population into the boundary layer with\naccelerated magnetosheath-like electron population is step-\nlike, the temperature changes without significant change in\ndensity. As a result, we cannot find a good fit using a simple\npolynomial curve to describe the transition between magne-\ntosheath and plasma sheet across the complicated structure of\nboundary layers.\n[49] To improve this transition, we limit the time of\ninterest to 0100\u20130220 UT (Figure 6, bottom). As one can\nsee, we remove from our analysis the magnetosheath and\nFigure 6. Scatter logarithmic plot of the electron density\nversus the electron temperature for (top) the interval 0000\u2013\n0340 UT and (bottom) the interval 0100\u20130220 UT. The\nsolid lines on both plots represent the least squares fits. On\nthe top plot there are five groups of observational points,\nrepresenting populations of the magnetosheath proper, the\nplasma depletion layer, two boundary layers, and the\nmagnetosphere proper. On the bottom plot there are only\nfour groups, the populations are similar to the bottom plot\nexcept the magnetosheath proper which is not observed due\nto a smaller time interval being used. The solid line on the\nbottom plot is used for the transition parameter reordering.\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n13 of 33\nA07S07\nplasma sheet proper populations. Thus, we now analyze the\ntransition from the plasma depletion layer into the boundary\nlayer on closed field lines across the boundary layers with\naccelerated magnetosheath-like electron population and the\ntransition layer. The fitted curve shows relatively good\nanticorrelation between electron temperature and density\nand we use this curve for the estimation of transition\nparameter values, with the transition parameter TP = 0\nbeing for the PDL population and the transition parameter\nTP = 100 being for the boundary layer on closed field lines\npopulation. Figure 7 shows results of the transition param-\neter estimations. The first panel presents the transition\nparameter and the second and third panels show the mag-\nnetic field magnitude and electron average temperature for\nthe comparison. Inside the PDL, transition parameter is\nestimated to be between 0 and 7. Inside the boundary layer\non closed field lines, from 0200 UT, the transition parameter\nis around 87\u2013100. Inside the transition layer, during the\ninterval 0158\u20130200 UT, the transition parameter varies in\nthe limit from \u000130 to 87. In the sublayer with unidirectional\naccelerated magnetosheath-like electrons, characterized by\nthe magnetic field values similar to the PDL values, and by\nthe electrons with average temperature of \u000150 eV, higher\nthan in the PDL, the transition parameter varies between 7\nand 22. Finally, inside the sublayer with mixed populations\nof bidirectional magnetosheath-like electrons and plasma\nsheet electrons the transition parameter is estimated to be\nbetween \u000122 and 30.\n[50] Using the estimated transition parameter, we reorder\nthe electron spectra across the complicated boundary layer\nstructure. Figure 8 presents the results of this reordering,\nshowing the electron energy versus transition parameter\nspectrogram for the antiparallel, perpendicular, and parallel\ndifferential energy flux (color-coded). The data are reor-\ndered over the period 0100\u20130220 UT. Now it is very easy\nto see the different boundary sublayers discussed above\n(marked by vertical dashed lines). Thus, the PDL is observed\nfor TP = 0\u20137 and is characterized by antiparallel fluxes of\nelectrons at low energies and parallel fluxes of electrons at\nhigher energies.\n[51] One can see that the interval with TP = 7\u201322, which\ncorresponds to defined above boundary sublayer with\nunidirectional electron population, is not uniform and can\nbe split into two subintervals according to the electron\nproperties, with TP = 7\u201318 and TP = 18\u201322. During the\nperiod with TP = 7\u201318, there is a depletion in the fluxes of\nthe perpendicular electron population. The fluxes of the\nparallel population are also less intense than before and\nduring this interval there is continuous enhancement of the\naverage energy of the parallel population. In the same TP\nrange, TP = 7\u201318, there is also enhancement of the\nantiparallel fluxes at higher energies, E \u0001 80\u2013300 eV.\nHowever, the fluxes at these energies are low, and the\npopulation of the antiparallel electrons is still at energies\n\u000150 eV. This could be a sublayer with a unidirectional\nelectron population, as the parallel part of the population is\nsimilar to the PDL population, and the antiparallel part of\nthe population is a new population with unidirectional\nelectron beams. At TP = 18, the whole electron population\ndrastically changes. First, there are enhanced perpendicular\nfluxes of the electrons with sharply increased energy,\nE \u0001 70\u2013300 eV. Second, the fluxes of the parallel\npopulation increase and this population becomes slightly\nmore energetic, E \u0001 50\u2013300 eV. Finally, also at TP = 18,\nthere is the start of a significant energization of the\nantiparallel electron population. During the interval with\nTP = 18\u201322, one can see a continuous energization of the\nantiparallel electron population, from average energy of\n60 eV to \u0001100 eV. Similar, but less acceleration is seen in\nthe perpendicular and parallel components. Analysis of the\nFigure 7. The transition parameter, the magnetic field magnitude, and average electron temperature\nversus time, the 28 February 2004, 0115\u20130210 UT, TC1.\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n14 of 33\nA07S07\nratio of the differential energy fluxes of the population\nmoving in the parallel to the magnetic field direction to\nthat moving antiparallel (not shown) shows that the fluxes\nare not balanced at all energies. Moreover, the fluxes in\nthe parallel and antiparallel directions are significantly\nlarger than that in the perpendicular direction. Thus, this\nboundary sublayer can be described as a boundary layer\nwith not balanced bidirectional electrons. We note that the\ndiscussed above unidirectional boundary layer is more\ncomplicated than we thought before and we now identify\ntwo sublayers: proper unidirectional sublayer with TP =\n7\u201317 and sublayer with not balanced bidirectional elec-\ntrons (TP = 18\u201322).\n[52] During the interval with TP \u0001 22\u201330, there are high\nfluxes of electrons with bulk population at 90\u2013300 eV. This\npopulation is slightly more energetic than those observed\nduring the interval with TP = 18\u201322. The electron fluxes are\nbidirectional with significant fluxes in the perpendicular\ndirection as well. The ratio between fluxes in the parallel\nand antiparallel direction and that in the perpendicular\ndirection is less than during the period with TP \u0001 18\u201322.\nThe energy of the electron population is stable over this TP\nrange. There are some fluxes of the electrons with plasma\nsheet energies, E = 1\u201310 keV, but they are low. This high-\nenergy population is more evident in Figure 5. According to\nFigure 7, the interval with TP \u0001 22\u201330 corresponds to, for\nexample, the time interval 0134\u20130138 UT. During this time,\none can see some fluxes of electrons at energies 1\u20135 keV.\nThe whole population is concentrated at TP = 22\u201330. Thus,\nthis is the boundary sublayer with nearly balanced bidirec-\ntional energized magnetosheath-like electrons.\n[53] During the range with TP = 30\u201387, the fluxes of the\nmagnetosheath-like population are reduced, and we note\nthat with increasing TP the energies of the parallel and\nFigure 8.

The red vertical dashed lines mark different sublayers.\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n15 of 33\nA07S07\nantiparallel components decrease. However, the energy of\nthe perpendicular component slightly increases. During the\nsame period low fluxes of plasma sheet electrons, E = 1\u2013\n10 keV, are detected, mainly in the perpendicular direction.\nThis is the transition layer.\n[54] Finally, during the period with TP= 87\u2013100, the fluxes\nof the plasma sheet population strongly increase while fluxes\nof the magnetosheath-like population decrease. We note that\ninside this layer the electrons with low-energy, E = 10\u201320 eV,\nare bidirectional. They are most likely of ionospheric or\nplasmaspheric origin. The magnetosheath-like electrons are\nconcentrated at 90\u0001 pitch angle and there is some energy-TP\ndispersion: the energy of this population increases with\nincreasing TP and at TP = 100 reaches energies of 800\u2013\n900 eV. However, the fluxes of the magnetosheath-like\npopulation are low and are probably close to the one count\nlevel at the end of the interval. This magnetosheath-like\nelectron population is obvious in Figure 5, during the time\ninterval 0158\u20130210 UT. In Figure 7, one can see that the TP\nduring this time interval is 87\u201395, which corresponds to a\nsubregion discussed here. We define this region as the bound-\nary layer on closed field lines.We note that the evolution of the\nelectron population from the transition layer to the boundary\nlayer on closed field lines as seen on the electron energy-\ntransition parameter spectrogram is very smooth.\nFigure 9.

Figure 9\npresents results of this reordering, with the TP along the x\naxis. Panels, from the top to the bottom, show the electron\ndensity, the parallel electron temperature, the anisotropy of\nthe electron temperature, the X-, Y-, Z- components of the\nplasma velocity in the GSM coordinate system, and the\nthree components and the magnitude of the magnetic field\n(GSM). Similar to the previous plot, parameters were\nreordered over the time period 0100\u20130220 UT. To make\npresentation simpler, the dashed vertical lines separate the\ndifferent plasma regions discussed above. As one can see, in\nagreement with the previous discussion, the PDL layer, with\nTP = 0\u20137, is characterized by decreasing electron density,\nNe = 5\u201315 cm\n\u00023, low (but stable) electron temperature, Te =\n20 eV, anisotropy of 1\u20131.15, duskward convection of\nplasma and by northward magnetic field.\n[56] Inside the region with TP = 7\u201318, defined as the\nregion populated by unidirectional magnetosheath-like elec-\ntrons, the density is very stable, Ne \u0001 7 cm\u00023, the parallel\nelectron temperature increases with increasing TP from\n20 eV to 60\u201370 eV, and the anisotropy varies in the limit\n1.1\u20131.2. The X-component of plasma convection is very\nlow, VX \u0001 0 km s\u00021, the VY component has a lot of scatter\nand varies in the limit 20\u2013180 km s\u00021, and the VZ compo-\nnent is mostly positive, \u000240 km s\u00021 < VZ < 100 km s\u00021.\nInside this region, the X and Y components of the\nmagnetic field are very steady with BX \u0001 10\u201312 nT and\nBY \u0001 10\u201320 nT. The Z- component and the magnitude of\nthe magnetic field reaches maximal values and exceed\nvalues inside the PDL, with BZ being 80\u201385 nT and jBj\nbeing 80\u201390 nT.\n[57] Inside the region with TP = 18\u201322, which we\ndefined as the region with unbalanced fluxes of bidirection-\nal magnetosheath-like electrons (with significant heating of\nwhole electron population), lots of scatter is observed in all\nparameters, except the parallel electron temperature. Inside\nthis region, the electron density varies within the limits 6\u2013\n10 cm\u00023, the parallel electron temperature slowly increases\nfrom 70 eV to 90 eV, and the anisotropy of the electron\ntemperature is 0.9\u20131.2. All components of plasma velocity\nare highly scattered, with VX varying in the limit\n\u00b1120 km s\u00021, VY in the limit 20\u2013200 km s\n\u00021, and VZ\nin the limit \u00b160 km s\u00021. The BX component is relatively\nstable, 10\u201314 nT, and BY is scattered in the limit \u000210\u2013\n+20 nT. Both the Z-component and the magnitude of the\nmagnetic field have tendency to decrease inside this TP\ninterval, having values closer to and slightly less than those\ninside the PDL.\n[58] The region with TP = 22\u201330 is defined as the region\nwith a bidirectional magnetosheath-like population which is\nmixed with some plasma of plasma sheet origin. Inside this\nsubinterval, the electron density is almost constant (slightly\ndecreasing), and the electron parallel temperature is slightly\nincreasing. The behavior of the other parameters (except\nthe Z-component and magnitude of the magnetic field) over\nthe transition parameter range TP = 22\u201330 is similar to the\nbehavior inside the range TP = 18\u201322. The BZ component\nand the magnitude of the magnetic field continue to de-\ncrease inside this region, with BZ being within the limits\n65\u201380 nT and jBj being within the limits 68\u201382 nT. Inside\nthis region, the X and Y components of the magnetic field\nare \u000110 nT. There are less fluctuations in the plasma\nvelocity than before, with VX \u0001 0 km s\u00021, VY \u0001 100 km\ns\u00021, and VZ \u0001 0 km s\u00021.\n[59] The region with TP = 30\u201387 is defined as a\ntransition layer, as we detect both high- and low-energy\nelectron populations inside it. We note that there are only a\nfew data points in this region. The electron density is\nmonotonically decreasing from 5 cm\u00023 to 0.5 cm\u00023, the\nelectron parallel temperature is continuously increasing\nfrom 100 eV to \u0001500 eV, and the anisotropy of electron\ntemperature is slowly decreasing from \u00011 to 0.8, indicating\ndomination of the perpendicular population. The plasma\nvelocity is very low, and the magnetic field is very stable.\nFinally, at TP = 87\u2013100, inside the boundary layer on\nclosed field lines, the electron density is very low, the\nparallel temperature still increases, and the anisotropy of\nthe electron temperature is 0.8, indicating domination of\nthe trapped population. The plasma velocity changes inside\nthis region, VX \u0001 \u000250 km s\u00021, VY \u0001 50 km s\u00021, and\nVZ \u0001 \u000250 km s\u00021. The magnetic field is very stable and\nstrongly northward.\n[60] To summarize the TC1 observations and the reorder-\ning of these observations according to the transition param-\neter, we can say that the transition between the PDL and the\nboundary layer on closed field lines is very complicated and\nthe order of the transition is the PDL (TP = 0\u20137), the\nsublayer of the accelerated magnetosheath-like population\nwith a new unidirectional electron population, moving\nantiparallel to the magnetic field lines (TP = 7\u201318), the\nsublayer of the accelerated magnetosheath-like population\nwith unbalanced bi-directional electron population and\nadditional heating of whole electron population (TP =\n18\u201322), the sublayer with accelerated magnetosheath-like\npopulation with nearly balanced bidirectional electron\nbeams and with a trace of the plasma sheet electrons (TP =\n22\u201330), the transition layer, characterized by a mixture of\nboth, magnetosheath-like (with reduced fluxes) and plasma\nsheath like populations and by changes in the plasma\nparameters (TP = 30\u201387), and the boundary layer on closed\nfield lines, characterized by a mixture of plasma sheet and\nmagnetosheath electrons, however without significant\nchanges in the plasma parameters (TP = 87\u2013100). As one\ncan see, transitions between the different regions sometimes\nare smooth and the defined TP limits for different plasma\nregions are probably sometimes subjective. The exception is\nthe transition between different plasma states which hap-\npens at TP = 18, when we observe simultaneous heating of\nthe whole electron population.\n[61] Figure 10 presents a summary of typical electron\nspectra inside the different plasma regions identified above.\nThe first row shows 2-D cuts of the electron differential\nenergy flux. The horizontal axis corresponds to the perpen-\ndicular speed and the vertical axis corresponds to the\nparallel component. The figures have been mirrored around\nV = 0 for readability. The second row shows 1-D cuts of the\ndistribution in units of differential energy flux. Cuts are in\nthe parallel, perpendicular and antiparallel directions. The\nblack line corresponds to the cut at 0\u0001 pitch angle, the red\nline at 90\u0001 pitch angle, and the blue line at 180\u0001 pitch angle.\nThe third row presents 1-D cuts of the distribution in phase\nspace density units.

Column 2\nshows the electron distribution when unidirectional electron\nbeams are detected, at \u00010132 UT. The population at 0\u0001\npitch angle remains almost unchanged and is similar to the\nPDL population. However, the electron population is sig-\nnificantly heated and different to the PDL population.\nColumn 3 presents the electron population inside the\nboundary layer with unbalanced bidirectional electrons, at\n0140 UT, when significant heating occurs in all directions.\nOne can see that fluxes of electrons in the parallel and anti-\nparallel directions are not balanced at all energies. Column 4\nillustrates the electron distribution inside the region with\nbidirectional electron population which mixes with the\nplasma sheet population, at 0157 UT. The population is\nmore heated in comparison with the previous population;\nthere is some slight increasing of the perpendicular compo-\nnent at high energies. The parallel and antiparallel electron\npopulations are very close to being balanced at all energies.\nColumn 5 presents the electron distribution function inside\nthe transition layer, at 0158 UT. Inside this region, the\nelectron spectra are very interesting and are observed for\nmany spins. There are significant fluxes of the electrons\nwith plasma sheet energies at 90\u0001 pitch angle. At low\nenergies, there are observations of the bidirectional popula-\ntion. Moreover, the electrons with magnetosheath-like en-\nergies are dominant and they are concentrated at pitch\nangles of 45\u0001 and 135\u0001. This might be a signature of strong\npitch angle diffusion inside this region. Finally, column six\nshows electron spectra inside the boundary layer on closed\nfield lines, at 0203 UT. At this time, the plasma sheet\npopulation becomes dominant, with enhanced fluxes at 90\u0001\npitch angle. The magnetosheath-like population still exists,\nand its fluxes also are concentrated in the perpendicular\ndirection.\n3.4. Analysis of the Cluster Observations\n3.4.1. Cluster Observations Overview\n[62] Figure 11 presents an overview of Cluster SC2\nobservations on 28 February 2004, 0020\u20130210 UT. Figure\n11a consists of eight subpanels. Each subpanel presents the\npitch angle spectrogram (0\u0001\u2013180\u0001) for electrons with center\nenergy shown on the left (in the range 8.3\u20133100 eV).\nDifferential energy flux is color-coded according to the\nlogarithmic color bar shown on the right. Figures 11b,\n11c, and 11d show the electron density (logarithmic scale),\nthe electron temperature (logarithmic scale), and the anisot-\nropy of the electron temperature, defined as TII\/T?,\nrespectively. Different colors represent different Cluster\nspacecraft: SC1 is black, SC2 is red, SC3 is green, and\nSC4 is blue. Figures 11e, 11f, and 11g present the parallel\nand the X- and Y- components of the perpendicular plasma\nvelocity in the GSM coordinate system, respectively. The\nvelocity is calculated using PEACE 3DR data on SC2 (red)\nand HIA-CIS data on SC1 and SC3 (black and green lines).\nUnfortunately, there is a long data gap in the CIS observa-\ntions during this interval, thus the ion velocity is plotted\nonly when available. Figures 11h\u201311k show the X-, Y-, and\nZ-components of the magnetic field in the GSM coordinate\nsystem and the magnitude of the magnetic field, respectively.\nThe Cluster color code has been used. There is a data gap in\nthe FGM data during the interval 0045\u20130050 UT.\n[63] At 0020 UT, Cluster is inside the polar cap charac-\nterized by low fluxes of particles. During the interval\n\u00010033:00\u20130040:00 UT, Cluster detects low fluxes of the\nelectrons with magnetosheath-like energies. These electrons\nare bidirectional. The electron density inside this region Ne\n\u0001 1\u20132 cm\u00023, the electron temperature is \u0001100 eV, and the\nanisotropy of the temperature varies in the limit 1.1\u20131.4.\nThe parallel velocity increases up to 100 km s\u00021. Strong\nconvection is observed during this time interval, with V?X\nreaching\u0002100 km s\u00021, and V?Y reaching\u000250 km s\u00021. Thus,\nthe plasma convects antisunward and dawnward. This is in\nagreement with SuperDARN observations at this time in\nthe northern hemisphere: the footprint of Cluster is near the\n\u2018\u2018turning point\u2019\u2019 of the convection cell at the dawn sector.\nSmall-scale variations are observed in the X- and Y-\ncomponents of the magnetic field, and some depression of\nthe X-component is also evident. We defined this region as a\nboundary layer near the poleward boundary of the cusp.\n[64] During the period 0040\u20130047 UT, Cluster detects\nstrong enhancement of the electron fluxes, and the density\ninside this region is \u000110 cm\u00023. The electron population is\nstill strongly bidirectional at all energies, with fluxes in the\nparallel and antiparallel directions exceeding perpendicular\nfluxes. Analysis of the pitch angle spectrogram shows that\nfluxes at a pitch angle of 0\u0001 (downgoing population) are\nhigher than at 180\u0001 (upgoing, mirroring population). The\nelectron temperature decreases inside this region and is\naround 60 eV. There is a short data gap during this interval\nin the electron 3DR and magnetic field data, thus we are not\nable to make conclusions about plasma convection inside\nthis region. This region we define as a cusp subregion with\nmore bidirectional electron population.\n[65] During the period 0047\u20130110 UT, the properties of\nthe electron population inside the cusp change again: the\nelectron population becomes more isotropic at energies\n65\u2013130 eV, with increasing fluxes in the perpendicular\ndirection. However, the low-energy part of population,\nE < 65 eV, and the high-energy part of population,\n130 < E < 580 eV, show bidirectional beams. The electron\npopulation is not uniform and separate small duration injec-\ntions are occurring, which will be discussed later. The density\ninside this region is 10\u201312 cm\u00023, and the electron temper-\nature is \u000150 eV. The electron anisotropy is 1.2\u20131.3, and the\nplasma convection is very low, as is the parallel velocity.\nThere are still some small-scale fluctuations of the X- and\nY- components of the magnetic field inside this region. We\ndefined this region as a cusp subregion with more isotropic\nelectron population.\n[66] Between 0110 and 0118 UT, Cluster encounters a\nnew plasma region with different properties of the electron\npopulation. Magnetosheath-like electrons are observed with\nreduced fluxes in comparison to those during the previous\ntime interval. These electrons become more bidirectional,\nwith the maximum flux concentrating at 0\u201310\u0001 and 170\u2013\n180\u0001 pitch angles. In addition, there are some fluxes of\nelectrons with plasma sheet energies, E \u0001 1\u20133 keV. These\nelectrons have higher fluxes in the perpendicular direction.\nThus, this is a boundary layer near the equatorward edge of\nthe cusp on closed field lines. The density inside this layer is\nconstant, Ne \u0001 8\u20139 cm\u00023, at the beginning and decreases\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n19 of 33\nA07S07\nFigure 11. Overview of Cluster SC2 observations on 28 February 2004, 0020\u20130210 UT. (a) Eight\nsubpanels, in which each subpanel presents the pitch angle spectrogram (0\u0001\u2013180\u0001) for electrons with\ncenter energy shown on the left (in the range 8.3\u20133100 eV) Differential energy flux is color-coded\naccording to the logarithmic color bar shown on the right.

The electron temper-\nature is increasing, Te \u0001 90 eV, and the anisotropy is around\n1.1. However, this temperature anisotropy is averaged over\nthe whole electron population, which consists of counter-\nstreaming magnetosheath-like electrons and trapped plasma\nsheet electrons. The parallel and convection velocities are\nvery low and there are less fluctuations of the magnetic field\ninside this region.\n[67] Between 0118 and 0126 UT, the cusp appears to\nmove backward and forward past the spacecraft twice, and\nthis makes identification of different subregions inside and\nnear the cusp more complicated. During the period 0126\u2013\n0134 UT, Cluster crosses another sublayer which is char-\nacterized by an electron population similar to those inside\nthe previous sublayer, during the interval 0110\u20130118 UT.\nHowever, fluxes of the magnetosheath-like electron popu-\nlation are greatly reduced. The electron density inside this\nsub-layer is constant and around \u00015 cm\u00023, the electron\ntemperature increases up to 150 eV, and the anisotropy \u00011.\nThe plasma convection and parallel velocities are very low.\nIt is hard to tell whether this region is an extension of the\npreviously observed boundary sublayer on closed field lines\nnear the equatorward edge of the cusp or if this is an\nadditional boundary layer.\n[68] Finally, at \u00010134 UT, Cluster enters a region char-\nacterized by strong enhancement of the plasma sheet elec-\ntron population which is concentrated at 90\u0001 pitch angles.\nInside this region, Cluster still detects low fluxes of the\nmagnetosheath-like electrons. The low-energy part of these\nelectrons, E < 64 eV, is bidirectional and the high-energy\npart, 130 < E < 490 eV, has more flux at pitch angles\n\u000140\u0001 and \u0001140\u0001. The electron density inside this region is\nNe \u0001 1 cm\u00023, and the electron temperature Te \u0001 900\u2013\n1000 eV. The electron anisotropy becomes less than 1. The\nplasma velocity is very stable and low, and the magnetic field\nis very stable. Thus, this is another boundary layer on closed\nfield lines near the equatorward edge of the cusp.\n[69] As one can see, we find many subregions inside the\ncusp. To simplify analysis of Cluster observations and for\nthe comparison with TC1 observations, we reorder Cluster\nobservations using the transition parameter technique.\n3.4.2. Reordering of Cluster Observations According\nto Transition Parameter\n[70] First, as the transition parameter technique was\nintroduced for the reordering the data for transition between\nthe magnetosheath and the plasma sheet via the LLBL, we\nneed to check if we can use this technique in the cusp\nregion. Figure 12 shows two logarithmic scatterplots of the\nelectron density versus the electron perpendicular tempera-\nture. Both plots are based on SC2 3DR data. Owing to\ntelemetry available to the PEACE instrument on SC2, 3-D\ndata is available with spin (4 s) resolution. For the top panel\nwe use the time interval 0035\u20130210 UT, corresponding to\nthe full cusp crossing from the boundary layer near the\npoleward cusp edge to the boundary layer near the equa-\ntorward cusp edge. On the scatterplot, we can identify four\ndifferent clusters of points, corresponding to the cusp\nproper, two boundary layers, and the boundary layer on\nclosed field lines near the equatorward edge of the cusp.\nNote that the electron population which corresponds to the\nboundary layer near the poleward edge of the cusp, with low\ndensity and temperature, is not very well fitted by the least\nsquares curve. Thus, we cannot apply the transition param-\neter technique for the whole time interval. Therefore, we\nrestrict the time interval to 0050\u20130210 UT (Figure 12,\nbottom). There is a very good anticorrelation between\nelectron density and temperature over this time interval,\nand we use the estimated least squares fit for the transition\nparameter calculations. However, we should remember that\nwe perform this estimation starting from 0050 UT, when\nCluster is deep inside the cusp proper with more isotropic\nelectrons. Thus, in our transition parameter analysis we will\nmiss two subregions: the boundary layer near the poleward\nboundary of the cusp, and the beginning of the cusp, when\nbidirectional electron population is observed.\n[71] Figure 13 shows the transition parameter estimation\nover the time of interest (bottom). Figure 13 (top) presents\nelectron data from the PEACE LEEA sensor, for the\nFigure 12. Scatter logarithmic plot of the electron\ndensity versus the electron perpendicular temperature for\nthe intervals (top) 0035\u20130210 UT and (bottom) 0050\u2013\n0210 UT. The electron data are from SC2, using the 3DR\ndata product. The solid lines on both panels represent the\nleast squares fits. On the top plot there are four groups of\npoints, corresponding to the plasma populations inside: the\ncusp proper, the boundary layer near the equatorward edge\nof the cusp, the boundary layer near the poleward edge of\nthe cusp, and the magnetosphere proper. On the bottom plot,\nthe population inside the boundary layer near the poleward\nboundary of the cusp is removed.\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n21 of 33\nA07S07\ncomparison. Each subpanel shows the pitch angle distribu-\ntion for electrons with center energy shown on the left.\nTwenty different energy ranges are used which allow us to\nsee more details in the electron distribution. Thus, it is more\nclear that during the interval 0047\u20130110 UT, the electron\npopulation is not uniform, but small-scale separate injec-\ntions are seen (especially at energy ranges of 180 eV and\n250 eV) at \u00010050 UT, \u00010057 UT, \u00010102 UT, and\n\u00010103 UT. It is also clear that during the time interval\n0047\u20130110 UT parallel and antiparallel fluxes of electrons\nare balanced at all energies, when compared to the electron\ndistribution during the interval 0040\u20130047 UT, where the\npopulation with 0\u0001 pitch angle is dominant. This might\nsuggest that during the period 0047\u20130110 UT the field lines\nare closed.\n[72] The transition parameter during the period 0050\u2013\n0110 UT, inside the cusp proper with more isotropic\nelectron population, does not change much and varies in\nthe limits 2\u201312. The transition parameter \u000112\u201322 corre-\nsponds to the first boundary layer near the equatorward\nboundary of the cusp, observed during the period 0110\u2013\n0118 UT. Most of the time, the TP is stable inside this layer\nand is around 20. During the interval 0127\u20130134 UT, inside\nthe second boundary layer with similar electron population\nto those inside the previous boundary layer, but with\nreduced fluxes of the magnetosheath-like population, the\ntransition parameter is in the range 35\u201350. Finally, during\nthe period 0134\u20130210 UT, when Cluster is inside the third\nboundary layer near the equatorward boundary of the cusp,\ncharacterized by even more reduced fluxes of the magneto-\nsheath-like population, the transition parameter varies with-\nin the limits 90\u2013100.\n[73] Figure 14 shows electron differential energy flux in\nthe antiparallel, perpendicular and parallel directions reor-\ndered according to the transition parameter. Again, a similar\ntime interval is used, 0050\u20130210 UT. Thus, TP = 0\ncorresponds to the cusp proper population with nearly\nisotropic electron distribution, and TP = 100 corresponds\nto the third boundary layer near the equatorward boundary\nof the cusp. The poleward boundary layer and beginning of\nthe cusp proper is missing from this analysis. One can see\nthat the reordered spectrogram shows very smooth transi-\ntion of the electron spectra between the different regions\ndefined above.\nFigure 13. The top (colored) panel is electron data from the LEEA sensor of the PEACE instrument, on\n28th February 2004, 0020\u20130210 UT, for 20 energy bins in the range 6\u20133800 eV. Each subpanel in the\nfirst panel presents the pitch angle distribution (0\u0001\u2013180\u0001) for electrons with center energy shown on the\nleft. Differential energy flux is color-coded according to the logarithmic color bar shown on the right. The\nbottom panel shows the transition parameter estimated from SC2 3DR data versus time.\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n22 of 33\nA07S07\n[74] Thus, the fluxes of the magnetosheath-like electrons\nreduce with increasing TP. We note that the bulk energy of\nthe parallel and antiparallel components of this population\nstarts to decrease from TP \u0001 15, while the energy of the\nperpendicular component begins to increase from TP \u0001 15.\nAt around the same TP, reduced fluxes of the plasma sheet\nelectron population are detected, with more fluxes at 90\u0001\npitch angle. With increasing TP, the fluxes of the plasma\nsheet population become stronger. Speaking about the\ndifferent subregions, one can note that during the period\nwith TP = 0\u201312 (15), the fluxes of the magnetosheath-like\nelectrons are very high with significant fluxes in the\nperpendicular direction (similar to observations presented\nin Figure 13). From TP \u0001 15, smooth changes in the\nelectron population are observed, as mentioned above.\nThe transitions between different sublayers are somewhat\nsubjective, but we can conclude that during the period with\nTP = 15\u2013100, three subregions are observed with more and\nmore reduced fluxes of the magnetosheath-like electrons,\ncorresponding to TP = 12 (15)\u201322, TP = 35\u201350, and\nTP = 50\u2013100.\n[75] Figure 15 shows the electron density, the electron\nparallel temperature, and the anisotropy of the electron\ntemperature which are reordered according to the transition\nparameter. The transition parameter from SC2 is used, and\ndifferent colors show data points from the different Cluster\nspacecraft (with the usual color code). This plot is recon-\nstructed over the time interval 0050\u20130210 UT. There is a\nvery good agreement between observations from all Cluster\nspacecraft. This figure clearly demonstrates that the transi-\ntion from the cusp proper into the magnetosphere proper is\nsmooth, with the electron density decreasing and the electron\nFigure 14.

The anisotropy of\nthe electron population is decreasing with the increasing TP\nas well, which indicates that the population is switching from\nbeing bidirectional at low energies to being trapped at high\nenergies. However, one can see (especially on the density and\nanisotropy plots) that the electron population consists of four\ngroups of points with a few points connecting these clusters.\nThe first group of points, with TP = 0\u201310, corresponds to the\ncusp proper with more isotropic electron distribution. The\nelectron density and anisotropy decrease across this region.\nThe second group of points, near TP= 15\u201322, corresponds to\nthe first boundary layer near the equatorward edge of the\ncusp. Inside this region, the electron parameters are stable\nand density plateau is observed at all Cluster spacecraft. The\nthird cluster of points is concentrated near TP = 35\u201350.\nInside this region, the density is relatively stable, but the\ntemperature is increasing and the anisotropy of the temper-\nature is decreasing. The fourth group of points is concen-\ntrated near TP = 90\u2013100. Inside this group, there are\nprominent changes of electron parameters, with decreasing\nelectron density and anisotropy and increasing temperature.\n[76] Finally, Figure 16 presents examples of the electron\nspectra inside the different regions identified above. The\nformat of this figure is similar to Figure 10. Column one\nshows the electron spectra at 0026 UT, inside the poleward\nboundary layer. As one can see, the electron flux is very low\nand the electron population is slightly bidirectional. This\nboundary layer might be the electron edge of the LLBL\n[e.g., Bogdanova et al., 2006]. Column two presents the\nelectron distribution inside the cusp subregion with more\nbidirectional electron population, at 0046 UT. Inside this\nregion, electron fluxes are strongly increased. The electron\ndistribution is strongly anisotropic, with parallel and anti-\nparallel fluxes exceeding perpendicular fluxes and with\nparallel fluxes (downgoing population) exceeding the anti-\nparallel fluxes (upgoing population). During this interval,\nthere are missing data in the parallel direction, and thus we\npresent cuts of the distribution at 20\u0001 and 160\u0001 pitch angles.\nColumn three shows the electron distribution function\ninside the cusp proper with a more isotropic electron\npopulation, at 0055 UT. One can see significant heating\nof the whole electron population in comparison with the\nprevious interval. However, fluxes of the counterstreaming\npopulation are still exceeding the fluxes of the perpendic-\nular population. Moreover, the fluxes of the counterstream-\ning population are not balanced at all energies. Column four\npresents the electron distribution at \u00010157 UT, inside the\nseparate electron beam with slightly higher energies. The\nelectron spectra are very similar to the previous interval,\nhowever, at this time the fluxes of the counterstreaming\npopulation are completely balanced, indicating that this\npopulation on closed field lines [e.g., Phan et al., 2005].\nColumn five shows the electron spectra inside the first\nequatorward boundary layer, at 0116 UT.

Comparison of Electron Populations Observed\nby Cluster and TC1\n[77] Figure 17 shows comparison of Cluster and TC1\nelectron populations in the form of logarithmic scatterplot of\nthe electron density versus electron perpendicular tempera-\nture. TC1 data is used for the interval 0100\u20130200 UT and\nCluster SC2 data is used for the interval 0050\u20130210 UT.\nRecall that for Cluster we used the limited time interval, and\npoints on the plot represent the cusp proper and three\nequatorward boundary layers. One can see that the Cluster\nand TC1 satellites detect similar plasma populations, espe-\ncially those with high temperature and low density. This\nwill be discussed further in section 4.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Large-Scale Reconnection Geometry at the\nMagnetopause\n[78] For the most of the time of interest the IMF is\nstrongly northward and any antiparallel reconnection site\nis expected to be located poleward of the cusp, in the lobe\nsector [e.g., Dungey, 1963]. Moreover, these conditions are\nalso favorable for the occurrence of dual lobe reconnection\n[Song and Russell, 1992; Song et al., 2002]. As the IMF BX\ncomponent is negative, the reconnection is expected to\nhappen first in the lobe sector of the northern hemisphere.\n[79] The SuperDARN data presented in section 2 are in\nagreement with this suggestion. The SuperDARN observa-\ntions of sunward ionospheric convection at the cusp foot-\nprints in both hemispheres reveal the existence of a\nreconnection site in the lobe sector of the southern hemi-\nsphere during the period 0040\u20130200 UT and the existence a\nreconnection site in the lobe sector of the northern hemi-\nsphere during the interval 0040\u20130140 UT. Simultaneous\nexistence of reconnection sites in both lobes is suggestive\nthat the process of dual lobe reconnection might occur for\nsome time. Moreover, as sunward convection cells are\nobserved over a period of 1 h, it suggests that both\nreconnection sites are continually in operation during the\ntime of interest and that we can compare observations from\nthe TC1 and Cluster satellites, even if they are not exactly at\nthe same time. In addition, SuperDARN observations of the\nconvection cell at the dusk sector of the northern hemi-\nsphere suggest the existence of an additional reconnection\nsite at the dusk flank sector of the northern hemisphere\nduring the entire time of interest. This additional reconnec-\ntion site at the dusk flank sector makes observations more\ncomplicated and we must treat the nearly simultaneous\nobservations between Cluster and TC1 with more caution,\nas they are separated by 1 h in MLT.\n4.2. Discussion of TC1 Observations\n[80] Our observations reveal that boundary layer crossing\nby TC1 was very complicated due to backward and for-\nwards motion of the magnetopause, which is in agreement\nwith the predicted stand-off distance of the magnetopause.\nThus, we applied the transition parameter technique for this\nLLBL crossing. However, there is some disagreement in the\nreordering of the electron density and temperature during\nthe transition between magnetosheath to plasma sheet\npopulations across observed boundary layer in comparison\nto previous studies. Hapgood and Bryant [1992] show that\nthere is a smooth transition between two extreme plasma\nstates with many observational points corresponding to the\ntransition states. In our data set, the transition between the\nPDL and LLBL populations is very sharp and seen only as a\nchange in the electron temperature but not electron density.\nThe smooth transition with increasing temperature and\ndecreasing density is observed in our event for limited TP\nrange, inside the transition layer. However, the whole\ntransition was much more complicated than reported previ-\nously [Hapgood and Bryant, 1990, 1992]. Despite this, we\nshow that it is possible to apply the transition parameter\ntechnique for the complicated boundary layers and that\nreordering data according the TP values is successful and\nreveals many important plasma (electron) features inside\ndifferent sublayers of the LLBL.\n[81] Using reordered (according to the TP) plasma and\nmagnetic field data and analyzing the electron distribution\nfunctions, we conclude that TC1 crosses the different\nplasma regions which are formed by different processes.\nFigure 18 depicts all possible magnetic field topologies\nwhich are formed due to the dual lobe reconnection process.\nWe suggest that the TC1 observations, while it moves from\nthe magnetosheath into the magnetosphere, can be\nexplained by TC1 crossing these different plasma sublayers\nFigure 17. Comparison of Cluster and TC1 plasma\npopulations. Scatter logarithmic plot of the electron density\nversus the electron perpendicular temperature. TC1 data is\nused for the interval 0100\u20130220 UT (red crosses). Cluster\nSC2 data is used for the interval 0050\u20130210 UT (green\ncrosses).\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n26 of 33\nA07S07\nThe first region is the plasma depletion layer characterized\nby low plasma density and temperature and anisotropic\nelectron population, with low-energy electrons moving\nanti-parallel to the magnetic field and high-energy electrons\nmoving parallel to local magnetic field. These field lines are\nindicated by line one on Figure 18. The second region\ncrossed by TC1 is populated by field lines with a specific\nelectron distribution, where the parallel part of distribution\nis similar to the PDL population, and the antiparallel part is\nchanged to the electron beam distribution over broad range\nof energies. These observations are similar to Fuselier et al.\n[1995, 1997]. These field lines are formed due to the\nreconnection process occurring between the draped magne-\ntosheath (or PDL) field lines and lobe field lines poleward\nof the cusp in the northern hemisphere. These newly\nreconnected field lines are outside the magnetopause (line\ntwo on Figure 18). They contain the PDL electron popula-\ntion moving toward the reconnection site at 0\u0001 pitch angles\nand electrons heated at the reconnection site and propagat-\ning at 180\u0001 pitch angles.\n[82] The next population sampled by TC1 is on field lines\nopen during the northern lobe reconnection process which\nconvect across the magnetopause, thus \u2018\u2018sinking\u2019\u2019 inside the\nmagnetosphere (line three in Figure 18). This sinking\nprocess links to the propagation of the kink in the magnetic\nfield lines. As the magnetopause is a topological boundary,\nwe suggest that the time when the spacecraft is crossing this\nboundary can be defined by the relative position of the\nspacecraft and the kink in the magnetic field. Thus, if\nthe kink in the magnetic field is earthward relative to the\nspacecraft, it means that the satellite is located on the field\nline outside the magnetopause, in the magnetosheath bound-\nary layer (line two in Figure 18). Alternatively, if the\nsatellite is earthward relative to the kink in the magnetic\nfield, it means that the kink passed over the spacecraft, and\nthe satellite is located on the field lines which \u2018\u2018sink\u2019\u2019 inside\nthe magnetosphere (line three in Figure 18). In the TC1\nobservations, these field lines are marked by significant\nheating of whole electron population, not only in the\nparallel and antiparallel directions, but also in the perpen-\ndicular direction, similar to observations by Paschmann et\nal. [1993]. The transition from open field lines outside the\nmagnetopause to the open field lines inside the magneto-\npause is very sharp on the data reordered according to\nthe transition parameter, and it happens at TP = 17. In the\nreordered spectrogram, one can see a sharp increase in the\nenergy of the electron population. A major rotation in\nthe magnetic field is also happening around this TP value,\nFigure 18. Schematic of the formation of the low-latitude boundary layer observed at the dayside by\nTC1 satellite. Line one shows the PDL field line, draped around the dayside magnetosphere. Line two\nrepresents a field line which is formed due to reconnection between the PDL and lobe field lines\npoleward of the cusp in the northern hemisphere. This field line is open and is outside the magnetopause,\nin the magnetosheath boundary layer. Line three represents an open field line which is formed due to\nreconnection poleward of the cusp in the northern hemisphere and which sinks inside the magnetosphere,\ncrossing the magnetopause. Line four shows a field line which is formed by dual lobe reconnection. Line\nfive represents field lines populated by plasma with reduced fluxes from both magnetosheath and\nmagnetosphere sources. The process responsible for this population is diffusion across the magnetic field.\nOther lines show the magnetospheric field lines. The dashed line shows the magnetopause which is\ndefined as a topological boundary.\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n27 of 33\nA07S07\nindicating that the kink in the magnetic field passed over\nTC1. The parallel and antiparallel fluxes of electrons on\nthese field lines are not completely balanced, which indi-\ncates that these field lines are open [e.g., Phan et al., 2005].\nA heated electron population on open field lines inside the\nmagnetosphere was observed previously by Fuselier et al.\n[1997]. During northward IMF, the magnetopause near the\nsubsolar point is a topological boundary and thus we\nwould not expect any heating to occur when the electron\npopulation is crossing this boundary. However, it was\nshown that significant heating of the plasma population\nmight exist at the high-latitude magnetopause where shear\nbetween terrestrial and magnetosheath field lines is high\n[Onsager and Scudder, 2002]. As we established previous-\nly, the lobe reconnection was continuous during the time\ninterval of interest, and we suggest that there is a continuous\nsupply of reconnected field lines which slowly \u2018\u2018sinks\u2019\u2019\ninside the magnetosphere. When these field lines cross the\nmagnetopause under high enough shear, the heated electron\npopulation is observed by TC1. Moreover, some energiza-\ntion may occur even at the low-latitude magnetopause,\nwhen the plasma population interacts with the kink in the\nmagnetic field.\n[83] The next population detected by TC1 is field lines\nreconnected a second time in the lobe sector of the southern\nhemisphere (line four on Figure 18). On these field lines, the\nmagnetosheath-like part of the electron population under-\ngoes additional heating which could be due to additional\nenergization at the second reconnection site [Onsager et al.,\n2001]. The parallel and antiparallel fluxes of the magneto-\nsheath-like electrons are very close to being balanced inside\nthis region. Moreover, the low fluxes of the electrons with\nplasma sheet energies indicate that these field lines are\nclosed. This region is still dominated by the magneto-\nsheath-like plasma and the electron density is still very\nhigh, being \u00016 cm\u00023, and slightly decreases in comparison\nto that inside the boundary layer on open field lines,\nNe \u0001 8 cm\u00023. Such a small change in the density of the\nplasma inside open and reclosed field lines is in agree-\nment with previous observations by Onsager et al. [2001]\nand Bogdanova et al. [2005], but disagrees with obser-\nvations by Le et al. [1996].\n[84] For a short time TC1 samples the transition layer\nwith unique plasma properties (line five on Figure 18). On\nthis field lines, there is a strong reduction of the magneto-\nsheath-like plasma flux in the comparison to the flux on\nthe reclosed field lines. There are density and temperature\ngradients inside this region, which can indicate the cross-\nfield diffusion due to wave-particle interactions [e.g., Bauer\net al., 2001]. In the diffusion process, the magnetosheath\nplasma enters the LLBL locally by scattering across the\nmagnetic field lines. We can see indication of the diffusion\nprobably in the electron distribution functions which show\nstrong changes in the electron distribution according to\npitch angles and some pitch angle scattering. Thus, we\nsuggest that this boundary layer is formed by processes\nother than reconnection, most likely by diffusion process.\n[85] Finally, TC1 enters the boundary layer on closed\nfield lines characterized by a domination of the trapped\nplasma sheet population and by low fluxes of the trapped\nmagnetosheath-like population (line six on Figure 18). This\nboundary layer probably is continuation of the transition\nlayer and is formed during diffusion process inside the\ntransition layer, as there is a constant change in the electron\npitch angles inside these two layers from \u000145\u0001 and \u0001135\u0001\ninside the transition layer to 90\u0001 inside this boundary layer.\n[86] In summary, we conclude that the LLBL observed by\nTC1 near the subsolar magnetopause has a complicated\nstructure. Some parts of this boundary layer may be formed\nby single- and dual-lobe reconnection processes and some\nparts formed more likely due to diffusion processes. The\nobservations and interpretation of the reconnection-formed\npart of the LLBL is similar to work by Le et al. [1996].\nHowever, Le et al. [1996] based their observations and\ninterpretation on ion data, and here we use electron data.\nUsing high-resolution electron data and the transition-\nparameter re-ordering technique, we can identity two types\nof open field lines, inside and outside the magnetopause,\nwhich is different to the observations of Le et al. [1996].\nAnother disagreement is in the properties of the plasma on\nreclosed field lines. Le et al. [1996] showed examples where\nfluxes of magnetosheath and magnetospheric ion popula-\ntions were comparable on the reclosed field lines and the\nplasma density was greatly reduced in comparison to that on\nopen field lines. However, in the observations discussed\nhere, the reclosed field lines are dominated by the magneto-\nsheath-like plasma population and fluxes of electrons with\nplasma sheet energies are very low. Furthermore, the plasma\ndensity on reclosed field lines is only slightly reduced in\ncomparison to that on open field lines. Thus, although our\nidea that part of the observed LLBL is formed by single- or\ndual-reconnection processes is similar to Le et al. [1996], the\ndescription of plasma signatures of closed field lines is\ndifferent.\n[87] Finally, we would like to discuss how our different\nsubregions of the LLBL correspond to the outer and inner\nboundary layers discussed previously [e.g., Bauer et al.,\n2001; Song et al., 1990, 1993; Le et al., 1996]. In the\npresent event, the open field lines outside the magnetopause\nare the magnetosheath boundary layer [Fuselier et al., 1995,\n1997; Onsager et al., 2001]. The outer boundary layer is\ncharacterized by mixing of both magnetosheath and plasma\nsheet populations and by the domination of the magneto-\nsheath population [e.g., Bauer et al., 2001]. Thus, the open\nfield lines inside the magnetosphere and the reclosed field\nlines both correspond to the outer boundary layer. The inner\nboundary layer is characterized by equal fluxes of the\nmagnetosheath bidirectional population and trapped plasma\nsheet population [e.g., Song et al., 1993; Bauer et al., 2001].\nThus, the inner boundary layer with properties described\nabove was absent. In our event, however, an additional\nlayer, which we call the transition layer, was observed.\nInside this layer, the fluxes of the plasma sheet and\nmagnetosheath populations were comparable, but magneto-\nsheath-like electrons show fast changes in pitch angle from\nthe counterstreaming population to the trapped population\nwhich we interpreted as a signature of enhanced diffusion\ninside this region.\n4.3. Discussion of Cluster Observations\n[88] The analysis of the plasma population inside the cusp\nreveals that the cusp observed by the Cluster satellites was\nsurrounded by a number of distinct boundary layers. The\nfirst boundary layer is observed near the poleward edge of\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n28 of 33\nA07S07\nthe cusp and contains the reduced fluxes of electrons of\nmagnetosheath energies. This boundary layer could be the\nelectron edge of the LLBL. The electron edge of the LLBL\nis often observed in the midaltitude cusp crossings during\nsouthward IMF near the equatorward boundary of the cusp\n[Bogdanova et al., 2006]. During northward IMF, when\nplasma inside the cusp is injected from the lobe reconnec-\ntion site, the electron edge of the LLBL is expected to be\nobserved near the poleward boundary of the cusp. Crossing\ninto the cusp proper, Cluster observes strong convection and\nplasma injections with the parallel velocity \u0001100 km s\u00021.\nThis indicates that plasma is injected from the reconnection\nsite which is located poleward of the cusp in the northern\nhemisphere [e.g., Fuselier et al., 2000b]. Thus, Cluster is on\nnewly reconnected field lines which are characterized by\nsignificant fluxes of counterstreaming electrons. Deeper\ninside the cusp, SC2 detects a more isotropic population\nof electrons with significant heating of electrons at all pitch\nangles. The plasma inside this region is stagnant. However,\nthe fluxes of the counterstreaming population at all energies\nare not completely balanced, indicating that these field lines\nare still open, despite the observed stagnation of the flow.\nInside the cusp proper a few separate short-scale electron\ninjections are observed. The electron energy inside these\ninjections is slightly higher than energies observed before\nand after injections. Moreover, analysis of the electron\ndistribution functions shows that fluxes of the counter-\nstreaming population are balanced at all energies. These\nfeatures in the electron population are both signatures of\nclosed topology of the magnetic field lines [e.g., Onsager et\nal., 2001; Phan et al., 2005]. Thus, we conclude that these\nseparate electron beams are on closed field lines which have\nbeen reclosed due to the reconnection process in the lobe\nsector of the southern hemisphere. Similar separate electron\nbeams with higher energies are observed on the other\nCluster spacecraft. Our observations imply that the second\nreconnection site is working in the pulsed regime, in\nagreement with previous observations by Sandholt et al.\n[2000], Provan et al. [2005], and Bogdanova et al. [2007].\n[89] At \u00010110 UT, Cluster enters to the boundary layer\ncharacterized by bidirectional magnetosheath-like popula-\ntion which is mixed with the plasma sheet population. The\nmagnetosheath-like population is dominant inside this re-\ngion. This boundary layer is separated from the previous\npopulation by a sharp boundary. Inside this region, the\nplateaus in the electron density and temperature are ob-\nserved, with density being around \u00018 cm\u00023 (in comparison\nto 10\u201320 cm\u00023 inside the cusp proper). Owing to existence\nof the plasma sheet trapped population, this boundary layer\nis on closed field lines. The plasma signatures are very\nsimilar to those inside the inner boundary layer near the\nmagnetopause described in previous studies [Bauer et al.,\n2001; Le et al., 1996]. Owing to the observed density\nplateau, this boundary layer is more likely formed by the\ndual lobe reconnection process. It is possible that separate\nelectron beams observed inside the cusp proper are on\nnewly closed field lines. Thus, these field lines are not yet\npopulated by the high-energy plasma. However, this bound-\nary layer is on older closed field lines as hot magnetospheric\npopulation has had enough time for the drift onto them. The\nproblem with this explanation is the sharp boundaries\nobserved in the electron temperature and density when\nCluster enters this boundary layer from the cusp. Alternative\nexplanation of the formation of the inner boundary layer or\n\u2018\u2018mixing region\u2019\u2019 was suggested by Fujimoto et al. [1998a].\nThey observed the mixing region near the tail flanks, where\nplasma properties were similar to those inside the IBL.\nInside the mixing region, the plasma convects sunward.\nThus, it was suggested that mixing of the magnetosheath\nand magnetospheric plasma occurs inside the mixing region\nfarther down the tail and the solar wind particles in the\nmixing region might be supplied to the magnetosphere by\nthe same process as those in the cold dense plasma sheet\n[Fujimoto et al., 1998b]. In the present event, the plasma\nconvection inside the boundary layer is slightly antisun-\nward, V?X \u0001 \u000210 km s\u00021, but this is essentially zero giving\nthe PEACE instrument error range. We should mention that\nthe boundary layer described above is often observed in\nCluster midaltitude cusp crossings during northward IMF,\nthus we need to study other events to confirm our conclu-\nsion about formation of this boundary layer.\n[90] At \u00010118 UT, there is sharp transition into a differ-\nent boundary layer. Inside this layer, the electron density\ndecreases and the electron temperature increases. However,\nin the scatterplot (Figure 12) one can see that inside this\nlayer there is a continuous change in these parameters,\nwhich is also seen in Figure 15. Thus, this may indicate\nthat diffusion process plays an important role in the forma-\ntion of this layer. The electron distribution functions show\nsome pitch angle scattering, with increased fluxes at 45\u0001 and\n135\u0001 pitch angles and decreased fluxes in the parallel and\nantiparallel direction. This may indicate that magneto-\nsheath-like electrons continuously fill the loss cone and\ndue to pitch angle diffusion are lost in the ionosphere [e.g.,\nSong et al., 1993].\n[91] Finally, at \u00010140 UT, Cluster enters the last bound-\nary layer near the equatorward edge of the cusp. Inside this\nlayer, the electron temperature strongly increases, while the\ndensity is very low and close to the magnetospheric values.\nThe trapped plasma sheet population is dominant inside this\nboundary layer. The magnetosheath-like population is also\ntrapped with a well-developed loss cone. As we discussed\nabove (section 3.4), the transition between these two\nboundary layers is smooth and we suggest that this bound-\nary layer can be treated as continuation of the previous\nboundary layer; however, these field lines are \u2018\u2018older,\u2019\u2019 with\na large part of the magnetosheath-like population having\nbeen lost in loss cone.\n4.4. Comparison of Cluster and TC1 Observations\n[92] There are some complications with the direct com-\nparison of plasma populations inside the different boundary\nlayers observed by Cluster and TC1. First, the closest\nconjunction in time between these satellites is when Cluster\ncrosses into the system of equatorward boundary layers and\nTC1 enters the magnetosheath-like boundary layers near the\ndayside magnetopause. However, when Cluster is inside the\ncusp proper, the TC1 satellite is still inside the\nmagnetosheath. Second, Cluster and TC1 are separated by\n\u00011.5 h MLT in the local time; thus, they are crossing\ndifferent field lines. However, as suggested by previous\nstudies, during stable northward IMF, the lobe reconnection\ncan be stable for an extended period of time [Fuselier et al.,\n2000b]. The spatial extent of the X-line in the lobe sector\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n29 of 33\nA07S07\nusually covers a few hours of MLT [e.g., Chisham et al.,\n2004; Fear et al., 2005b]. The SuperDARN observations\npresented above agree with previous results and suggest that\nreconnection in the lobe sectors of both hemispheres oper-\nates at least for 1 h. The predicted footprints of the TC1 and\nCluster satellites are close to each other and these two\nsatellites can observe injections of plasma coming from\nthe same X-line. As a result, we suggest that we can still\nattempt to compare plasma signatures observed by TC1 and\nCluster inside the different layers. Another problem with\ncomparison of these observations is that the interspacecraft\ncalibrations of the plasma instruments are not yet perfect.\nWe should also note that the magnetic field inside the cusp\nand inside the LLBL near dayside are different, the mag-\nnetic field magnitude at the Cluster altitude is \u0001150 nT, and\nat TC1 altitudes is \u000180 nT. Thus, to perform an accurate\ncomparison of electron populations we should perform\nLiouville mapping along the magnetic field. We have not\nyet done this, but note that if the Cluster and TC1 satellites\nare crossing the same field line, then Cluster would observe\nonly part of the population seen at TC1, as some of\npopulation with near-perpendicular pitch angles will be\nmirrored above the Cluster satellite. Finally, comparison\nof the trapped high-energy electron population is problem-\natic, as these electrons can be trapped in the region with\nhigh magnetic field and can be observed by one spacecraft\nbut not by another. These caveats need to be noted when\ncomparing the plasma populations inside the LLBL at the\ndayside and inside the midaltitude cusp.\n[93] From Figure 17, one can see a very good agreement\nbetween Cluster and TC1 observations inside the low\ndensity and high temperature part of the observed popula-\ntions, with log(Ne) < 0.8 and log(Te) > 1.8. However, we\nnote that Cluster detects many more points with such\nintermediate state than TC1. The parts of the electron\npopulation with low temperature and high density observed\nby both satellites do not agree that well. Of course, Cluster\ndoes not detect the PDL population and, due to the limited\ntime interval used for the Cluster reordering, the population\non newly reconnected field lines in the lobe sector of the\nnorthern hemisphere is missing in this figure. The density\nobserved inside the cusp region is a factor of \u00011.5 higher\nthan inside the LLBL populated by the magnetosheath-like\nplasma. Higher densities inside the cusp, in comparison to\nthe magnetosheath values, are often observed (B. Lavraud,\nprivate communication, 2007), which may indicate some\nadditional trapping process inside the cusp. The most\ninteresting result from this comparison is the identical\nelectron densities and temperatures inside the first equator-\nward boundary layer near the cusp, populated by the\nbidirectional electrons and trapped plasma sheet population,\nand inside the boundary layer at dayside, which we inter-\npreted to be on closed field lines.\n[94] Comparing the electron distribution functions and\nplasma properties inside the different subregions of the cusp\nand LLBL, we suggest that we can identify some similar\nsublayers near the dayside magnetopause and inside the\ncusp. We propose that the newly open field lines outside the\nmagnetopause observed by TC1 correspond to the poleward\nboundary layer inside the cusp which contains bidirectional\nelectrons. Inside both regions, the population is bidirection-\nal and a little heating is observed. The open field lines inside\nthe magnetosphere observed by TC1 might correspond to\nthe cusp proper field lines, as the electron distribution\nfunctions are very similar inside these two regions, showing\na significant heating of the whole population. We have some\nambiguity with the mapping of the LLBL on reclosed field\nlines observed by TC1, as in the Cluster observations we\nidentify two populations on closed field line formed by dual\nlobe reconnection. The first population is the separate\nelectron injections inside the cusp proper with slightly\nhigher energy than surrounding plasma. The distribution\nfunctions inside these injections are very similar to those\ninside the LLBL on closed field lines near the magneto-\npause. The second population is the first equatorward\nboundary layer observed by Cluster, with a trapped plasma\nsheet population and a strongly bidirectional magneto-\nsheath-like plasma. The density inside this region is similar\nto that observed inside the LLBL on closed field lines by\nTC1. However, the distribution functions are different, with\nelectrons of magnetosheath-like energies being more bidi-\nrectional in Cluster observations in comparison to the TC1\nobservations. As we discussed before, this probably could\nbe explained by the magnetic mirror effect, as only part of\nthe electron population observed near the magnetopause\nwill penetrate into the low altitudes. Thus, we suggest that it\nis more likely that the LLBL on reclosed field lines\nobserved by TC1 maps into the first equatorward boundary\nlayer observed by Cluster near the midaltitude cusp.\n[95] The electron densities and temperatures inside the\ntransition layer near the dayside magnetopause agree very\nwell with those inside the second equatorward boundary\nlayer near the cusp. Moreover, the electron distribution\nfunctions inside these regions are similar showing a loss\ncone and evidence of pitch angle diffusion. Thus, we\nsuggest that the transition layer maps into the second\nequatorward boundary layer near the cusp. We discussed\npreviously that inside these boundary layers a diffusion\nprocess can be important.\n[96] In summary, we conclude that despite of inexact\nconjunction between Cluster and TC1 observations in space\nand time, it is possible to identify similar sublayers near the\ndayside magnetopause and inside the midaltitude cusp region\n(Figure 18). This shows that the cusp provides a snapshot of\nthe magnetopause conditions and that reconnection is a\nglobal phenomenon as the observations can be similar even\nthough the local time and latitude locations are different.\n5. Conclusions\n[97] We perform a detailed study of the structure of the\nLLBL observed near subsolar magnetopause by TC1 and\nmidaltitude cusp region observed by the Cluster satellites\nduring prolonged interval of northward IMF. We show that\nmoving from the magnetosheath toward the dayside plasma\nsheet, TC1 observed a complicated structure of boundary\nlayers: the plasma depletion layer, the magnetosheath\nboundary layer, populated by field lines newly reconnected\nin the lobe sector of the northern hemisphere, the LLBL,\ncontaining (1) open field lines, reconnected in the lobe\nsector of the northern hemisphere, (2) reclosed field lines,\nreconnected a second time in the lobe sector of the southern\nhemisphere, and (3) a transition layer, which is formed more\nlikely by diffusion processes. We discuss the plasma sig-\nA07S07 BOGDANOVA ET AL.: LLBL AND CUSP UNDER NORTHWARD IMF\n30 of 33\nA07S07\nnatures inside each sublayer and show that transition\nparameter technique can be successfully used for the inter-\npretation of such a complex crossing.\n[98] In a similar MLT sector, Cluster, at nearly the same\ntime moving from the lobe sector toward dayside plasma\nsheet, crossed the midaltitude cusp regions surrounded by\nboundary layers. We identify the following subregions in\nthe Cluster data: the poleward boundary layer with reduced\nfluxes of the magnetosheath-like plasma, the poleward\nboundary layer on field lines newly reconnected in the lobe\nsector of the northern hemisphere, the cusp proper on open\nfield lines which were reconnected previously, separate\ninjections on newly reclosed field lines with higher energies\nthan the surrounding population, the equatorward boundary\nlayer which is formed by dual lobe reconnection, and\nanother equatorward boundary layer which is formed more\nlikely by diffusion processes as suggested by smooth\ngradients in the plasma parameters and electron pitch angle\ndiffusion inside. Similar to TC1, we discuss plasma signa-\ntures inside each sublayer and show that we can use\ntransition parameter technique for the reordering plasma\nparameters near the equatorward boundary of the cusp.\n[99] Finally, we compare observations from the TC1 and\nLLBL satellites and suggest that the LLBL sublayers maps\ninto the different sublayers observed in and around the cusp.\nThus, the boundary layer on newly open field lines outside\nthe magnetopause can correspond to the poleward boundary\nlayer inside the cusp which contains bidirectional electrons\n(both subregions are formed by the reconnection in the lobe\nsector of the northern hemisphere); the open field lines\ninside the magnetosphere near the subsolar magnetopause\ncorrespond to the cusp proper (both are formed by the\nnorthern hemisphere lobe reconnection); the part of the\nLLBL with the bidirectional magnetosheath-like electron\npopulation corresponds to the first equatorward boundary\nnear the cusp (both are formed by dual lobe reconnection\nprocesses), and the transition layer near the dayside mag-\nnetopause corresponds to the second equatorward boundary\nlayer near the cusp. Both sublayers are formed by the\ndiffusion processes, but they would not exist without\nreconnection upstream from the sublayer location.\n[100] In conclusion we note that further investigation of\nsuch events is needed, which should include the study of the\nboth electron and ion populations inside the cusp and\nboundary layer in order to fully understand properties of\nthe different sublayers.\n[101] Acknowledgments.
