Introduction1 \nThe aim of this paper is to provide a critical assessment of some of the scholarly \nliterature within several branches of the social sciences that focus on \u2018The Information \nSociety\u2019. This assessment is based on a review of some 800 works published in English \nfrom the late 1940s to 2008 with a focus predominantly on historical perspectives, the \nworks of those grappling with the economic relationships between information, \nknowledge and society; issues of democracy, governance and regulation; and the role of \ninformation and communication technologies (ICTs) in every day life.2  It will come as \nno surprise to readers that the \u2018The Information Society\u2019 denotes a notoriously fuzzy \nconcept.  There are many critical assessments of this concept in the literature.  My \npurpose in the present paper is to examine the analytical foundations of works that \nconsider the \u2018life and times\u2019 of The Information Society, originating within the disciplines \nmainly of economics, politics and sociology as well as within the fields of media and \ncommunication studies and science and technology studies.   \n \nI acknowledge that there are many other disciplines and fields of study that have tackled \ninformation and knowledge problems. However, it is scholars from the areas surveyed \nhere who have worked to influence the direction of policy making and actions at the \ninstitutional level, intending to build societies that have come to be labelled collectively \u2013 \nThe Information Society.3  We know from the existing literature that discussions in this \narea frequently embrace dystopian or utopian sentiments with respect to the possibilities \noffered by new technologies. The opening quotation seems to capture these, albeit in a \nliterary form. In this paper I want to consider some of the reasons that there is so little \nreciprocal engagement across the boundaries of relevant disciplines and fields. Or, \nindeed, among those who see the challenge of building The Information Society as one \nprimarily of investment in technologies to improve the quantity, speed and reach of the \n 3 \ncirculation of information and those for whom such investment is justified (if at all) only \nby the individual or societal goals that are achieved in so doing.  My overall argument is \nthat while critical scholars offer much insight into the problematic nature of the concept \n\u2013 The Information Society \u2013 we often fail to convince those who are not already \npersuaded that it is a problematic concept insofar as it does not provide a means for a \nconsideration of the alternative societies that people may value.  In this paper, my aim is \nnot to search for \u2018the\u2019 alternative theory or set of practices that might address the \nproblem, but rather to assess whether there are some potentially new opportunities to \npromote a dialogue that has greater purchase on those who hold the power to establish \nthe policies and investment practices that will have consequences for the character of \nsocieties in the 21st century.   \n  \nIt might be expected in the light of the importance of information of all kinds in human \nlife, that research focusing on the life and times of \u2018The Information Society\u2019 would \nentice scholars with interests in both information production and consumption and in \nchanges in society more generally, to undertake analysis of its meanings and implications. \nAnd indeed it has. We might expect an interdisciplinary body of intellectual inquiry to \nhave emerged during the past 50 years or so since scholarly work started to focus on \nissues around information and communication control systems.  My review of published \nworks indicates, however, that there is relatively little cross-citation although, of course, \nthere are a few very frequently cited authors. This is unsurprising in the light of the \npersistence of disciplinary enclaves, but it is noteworthy that it is mainly, though not \nexclusively, insights arising within the discipline of economics that seem to influence \npolicy makers, albeit indirectly, in this area.   \n \nThis has important consequences because it means that many of the important social \ndynamics of societal change are persistently downplayed. This process of exclusion of \ncertain issues from the agenda of policy makers is aided by the continuing dominance of \nwhat I will call \u2018The Information Society\u2019 vision. In section 2, I review the origins of the \n\u2018The Information Society\u2019 concept, followed in section 3, by a synthesis of some of the \nscholarly critical appraisals of the concept.  The perspectives of economists who puzzle \nover information and knowledge are considered in section 4 and their positions are then \njuxtaposed, in section 5, with those of others who have sought to understand the \ndynamics of diverse digitally mediated societies using frameworks based on \n 4 \nconsiderations that are beyond the reach of the economists\u2019 analytical models.  This leads \nme to a consideration in section 6 of why relatively few of the arguments that are critical \nof the predominant vision of \u201cThe Information Society\u2019 seem to filter into policy \ndiscussions. In section 7, I reflect on whether there is reason to hope or reason for \ndespair regarding the likelihood of a change in the capacity of those who are critical of \n\u2018The Information Society\u2019 vision to make their voices are heard.  \n \n \n2. The Information Society Vision \n \nIn the early post-World War II period, a vision of what would come to be labelled \u2018The \nInformation Society\u2019 began to crystallize.  Scientists, engineers and mathematicians were \ninterested in information and communication control systems and technologies that \nmight help them to realize their hopes for the contributions of artificial intelligence and \nrobotics.  In the same period, economists were hoping that productivity gains reaped by \nmechanization could be replicated by automation. Policy makers were trying to maintain \nfull employment and growth, and information workers (such as librarians and software \nengineers) were attempting to increase access to knowledge by crafting better tools for \naccessing information. The assumption that enormous social and economic benefits \ncould be reaped by those best positioned to build on new ICTs quickly gained currency.  \n \nThe origins of an emphasis on information and communication control systems can be \ntraced to the publication in 1948 of Norbert Weiner\u2019s Cybernetics: Or Control and \nCommunication in the Animal and Machine. As Professor of Mathematics at the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he was interested in neurological systems \nand information processing and feedback systems. He would later suggest that \u2018to live \neffectively is to live with adequate information. \u2026 communication and control belong to \nthe essence of man\u2019s inner life, even as they belong to his life in society\u2019 (Wiener, 1956: \n17-18), but his research nevertheless focussed on individual capacities for information \nprocessing. Claude Shannon, an electrical engineer and mathematician, also at MIT, and \nWarren Weaver, a scientist and Director of Natural Sciences at the Rockefeller Institute, \npublished A Mathematical Theory of Communication in 1949. They were interested in \ndeveloping control systems for both military and non-military applications. Weiner \nobserved that \u2018society can only be understood through a study of the messages and the \n 5 \ncommunication facilities that belong to it\u2019 (Wiener, 1956: 16).  His view was characteristic \nof those working on cybernetics who emphasised both the underlying technology and a \n\u2018sender-receiver\u2019 (S-R) model of communication.  At about this time, although there were \nfew interdisciplinary collaborations with social scientists, Bateson (1951) was an active \ncontributor to the field.  His theoretical model contextualised communicative processes \nin ways that highlighted many of the limitations of a simple \u2018S-R\u2019 model and offered \ninsight into the way these processes are contextualised within wider social and cultural \ndevelopments. This work was a precursor to the development of theories of the \ncommunicative process that acknowledge its situatedness and context-dependency, \nthough this work has rarely informed discussions about \u2018The Information Society\u2019. \n \nIn the United States, economists such as Machlup (1962, 1980-84) and Porat and Rubin \n(1977) undertook empirical work aimed at measuring the intensity of information \nactivities in the United States economy and the growth in information-related \noccupations, following in the tradition established by Shannon and Weaver. This would \ngive rise to internationally comparative research aimed at mapping and measuring \u2018The \nInformation Society\u2019, initially focusing on industrialized countries (Godin 2008). Bell\u2019s \n(1973) The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society: A Venture in Social Forecasting brought the \ninformation age to the attention of a broader group of social scientists in the United \nStates and Europe. For Bell (1979: 501), the sociologist, \u2018the axial principle of the \npostindustrial society \u2026 is the centrality of theoretical knowledge and its new role, when \ncodified, as the director of social change\u2019. He said that the variables it was crucial to study \nwere information and knowledge,4 and that it was necessary to focus on business and \nmanagement issues as well as broad societal concerns. For Bell, Drucker (1969), a \nmanagement consultant, and others, the challenge was to forge a strong commitment to \ntechnological innovation as the mobiliser of economic and social progress.  \n \nMcLuhan (1962) had popularized the term \u2018global village\u20195 in his Gutenberg Galaxy: The \nMaking of Typographic Man, extending the work of Innis (1950, 1951), and emphasizing the \ndifferent features of communication in the written and oral traditions. McLuhan (1960: \n567) suggested that \u2018the advent of a new medium often reveals the lineaments and \nassumptions, as it were, of an old medium\u2019, sparking a vociferous debate \u2013 which \ncontinues - about whether specific ICTs are causally related to certain societal \nconfigurations. A growing fascination with the linkages between technology, information \n 6 \nand communication was not centred only in North America.  In the 1970s research in \nJapan by Masuda, for example, was also leading to a vision of \u2018The Information Society\u2019. \nHe referred to a \u2018computopia\u2019 (Masuda, 1980: 147), a society that would \u2018function around \nthe axis of information values rather than material values\u2019 and, rather idealistically, as one \nthat would be \u2018chosen, not given\u2019.  \n \nNotwithstanding the strong association between social transformation and technological \ninnovation in much of this early scholarship, the main orientation of what would become \nthe pervasive dominant vision of \u2018The Information Society\u2019 is strongly informed by the \nidea that if better versions of the underlying technologies could be built, they should be \ndeveloped in order to drive economic growth and to augment military strength. ICTs, \nenabling faster and cheaper information processing, are expected by many of those who \nchampion this vision to underpin a new productivity strategy, stimulating growth and \nimproving productivity in the manufacturing sector and leading to the expansion of new \ninformation and service-related industries.  In short, if everyone invests in each new \ninnovative development in ICTs as a matter of priority, this will lead to:  \u2018\u2026 the best of \ntimes, \u2026 the epoch of belief, \u2026 the season of Light, \u2026 the spring of hope\u2019 (Dickens, \n1859: 1). \n \n \n3. A Problematic Vision \n \nThe hegemony of the singular construction \u2013 The Information Society - should not go \nunchallenged.6  In this section I consider some of the arguments of those who have \nquestioned the meaning implied by the singular, dominant vision offered by \u2018The \nInformation Society\u2019 concept, linked as it is to the growing use of ICTs in the acquisition, \nstorage and processing of information. Questions have been raised about this concept \nsince the early contributions by Weiner and by Shannon and Weaver, by those working \nwithin the discipline of sociology and the fields of science and technology and media and \ncommunication studies.  \n \nFor example, Innis (1951) warned against the \u2018ideology of information technology\u2019, \nsuggesting that the economic, social, cultural and political outcomes associated with a \ndependence on electronic information should not be straightforwardly associated with \n 7 \nenhanced human well-being. He took this view notwithstanding the common criticisms \nof his work in The Bias of Communication for its technological determinism.  Many scholars \nhave since been critical of the dominant vision often challenging the idea of a \nprogression through stages of social and economic organization to achieve \u2018The \nInformation Society\u2019.  Robins and Webster (1987: 87) found fault with this perspective, \nmaintaining that \u2018only when it becomes possible to confront the integral cultural and \neconomic dynamic of contemporary transformations, will it be possible to assess the \nspace for liberatory intervention as against the logic of domination and control in post-\nmodern cultural forms\u2019 aided by innovations in technology. And in his Theories of the \nInformation Society, initially published in the mid-1990s, Webster offers a comprehensive \ncritique of the concept drawing on various strands of social theory.  In the third edition \nin 2006 he says \u2018\u2026 oppositional though they are, all scholars acknowledge that there is \nsomething special about \u2018information\u2019\u2019 (Webster 2006: 2), indicating that with the passage \nof time there has been greater emphasis on people whose resources and dispositions \nshape the technology.   \n \nThis emphasis on society and on social processes as a counter to the scientism and \ndeterminism associated with the dominant vision is apparent in the work of numerous \nscholars.  For example, Golding and Murdock (1978: 347) maintained that a priority \nshould be to develop a theory of society with a focus on the implications of media and \ncommunication (or information) industry developments for social inequality. As they put \nit: \u2018determinism, in its arbitrary allocation of an unwarranted and unsupportable \nsignificance to the subject matter at hand, distorts beyond reprieve a balanced view of \nsocial structure and process\u2019 and leads to a neglect of \u2018sources of social dissent and \npolitical struggle\u2019. Beniger\u2019s (1986) The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins \nof the Information Society underlined the importance of technological convergence, but in \ncontrast to those who contended that \u2018The Information Society\u2019 was being driven by \ntechnological advances, Beniger highlighted the way that organizational systems were \ncontributing to the emergence of \u2018a single infrastructure of control\u2019, an infrastructure that \ndrew upon, rather than being determined by, the information machinery.  Like others \ncritical of the dominant vision, he said that society and its power relations provide the \nbackdrop for an analysis of the technologies and their applications. \n \n 8 \nLyon (1986: 586) similarly privileged society when he argued that it was unlikely that the \ndynamics of industrial capitalism would be altered substantially by the spread of digital \ntechnologies and Smythe ( 1977, 1981) challenged the premise that \u2018The Information \nSociety\u2019 would radically alter relations of political and economic dependency. Schiller \n(1981, 1984) examined concentrations of corporate ownership, which he argued were \nenabling the interests of capitalists to prevail in \u2018The Information Society\u2019. With Mi\u00e8ge \n(1990), he argued that there was \u2018more menace than promise\u2019 in information \ntechnologies. What mattered was the \u2018the structural character of the world community \nand the quality of life and social existence it offers to all people\u2019 (Schiller, 1980: 313), not \nonly the privileged few with access to innovative technologies for communication and \nthe production of content..  \n \nAt about the same time, in the field of science and technology studies, Miles and \nGershuny (1986) were examining the empirical evidence suggesting the growing \neconomic significance of information in the economy. They concluded that even if \ninformation was of growing significance in the economy, this development was \nassociated with very diverse service sectors and that analysis must be open to such \ndiversity.7 The statistical evidence pointing to a relatively homogeneous \u2018Information \nSociety\u2019 has continued to be questioned (Menou and Taylor 2006). Like Masuda who \nargued that changes in society should be \u2018chosen, not given\u2019, Miles and Gershuny \nadvocated debates on the economic implications of the unequal distribution of \ninformation resources and on alternative designs of ICTs, before the new systems are \ninstalled. Freeman and Soete (1990b) whose work associated the new ICTs with the \nrevolutionary potential of a new paradigm for the organisation of the economy, also \ncalled for a resolution of conflicting interests through public debate, as institutions and \nways of living were being re-shaped in parallel with technological innovations.  \n \nOthers stressed the continuity of historically formed relations of power in society, \nnotwithstanding the newness of technology.  Murdock (1993: 537), for instance, stressed \nthat, rather than concluding that everything is transformed into a post-modern age as a \nresult of innovations in technologies, the modern era should be seen as \u2018a complex \narticulation of formations, operating in different domains and at different levels\u2019. \nSomewhat later, Winston\u2019s (1998: 2) study revealed evidence of continuity between \nhistorical and modern social formations framed by the telegraph and the Internet. In \n 9 \ncontrast to those who focused on the disruptive or revolutionary character of \ninnovations in ICTs, Winston and others, including Mattelart (2002), Robertson (1990), \nSchement (1990) and Tremblay (1995), acknowledged the opportunities, but found the \ntechnologies were being  implemented in ways that replicated existing inequalities within \nsociety.  \n \nFor these scholars, if the dynamics of social reproduction were continuing to give rise to \nsocial and economic inequality, the likelihood was that innovations in ICTs would be \ncomplicit in this.  For them, the social order was still characterised by: \u2018the worst of \ntimes\u2019. Castells\u2019 (1996, 1997, 1998) work highlighted the cultural and institutional \nmanifestations of what he referred to as the network society and its association with \nsocial formations and unequal relations of power. He was criticized by some scholars \nsuch as Stehr (2000) and van Dijk (1999: 129) for offering a \u2018modern version of \n\u201ctechnological determinism\u201d\u2019, but he highlighted the enabling and the disabling \ncharacteristics of ICTs. Castells (2009) has continued to examine the network society, \nmost recently in Communication Power, in which he emphasises the consequences of \nexclusion from the dominant networks.  He proposes that: \n \n..this fragmentation of societies between the included and the excluded is more \nthan the expression of the time-lag required by the gradual incorporation of \nprevious social forms into the new dominant logic.  It is, in fact, a structural \nfeature of the global network society\u2019 (Castells 2009: 25). \n \nFor Castells, the dynamics of today\u2019s networks are associated with ideas, visions, projects \nand frames that generate actions that lead to exclusion and therefore to disadvantage \n(Castells 2009: 44). Set against this bleak conclusion, he has come to regard \u2018mass self-\ncommunication\u2019 as offering at least the possibility that challenges to the powerful \ncorporate producers of information may occur through the \u2018reprogramming\u2019 of networks \ndeveloped by social movements and their agents, enabling new values and interests to \ncome to the attention of the public. Castells\u2019 optimism regarding the ways in which \nnetworked insurgent communities can change \u2018hearts and minds\u2019 is, nevertheless, \ntempered by his analysis of the way dominant organisations strive to create electronic \nenclosures to contain these actors. Set against this view is Poster\u2019s (1990, 2006) more \n 10 \noptimistic observation \u2013 based on his  study of The Mode of Information - that information \nsocieties will not necessarily reproduce the \u2018neoimperialisms\u2019 of the past. \n \nCastells\u2019 effort to build a still incomplete theory of the network society, resonates with \nBeniger\u2019s (1990) earlier call for a general theory of information, communication, decision \nmaking and control.  Some of those who took up his suggestion include systems \ntheorists such as Luhmann (1996) and De Landa (1991) who offer similarly relational \naccounts of informational developments, but do so in ways such that people and their \nagency all but disappear.  Lash (2002: 112), for example, maintains that in the \ninformation age \u2018the centrality of the means of production are displaced by the means of \ncommunication\u2019, that non-linear socio-technical assemblages replace the institutions of \nearlier societies, and that a critique of information must emerge from information \nfeedback loops within the communication system itself. Following Luhmann\u2019s (1996) \nsystems theory, he argues that we can no longer [if we ever could] stand outside the \nsystem and critique it from some transcendent ideological position.  Castells, in contrast, \neschews the automaticity of the autopoietic or self-referential systems view.  \n \nWhat then are we to conclude about all this scholarly activity focusing in one way or \nanother on the growing salience of information, on communication and, increasingly, on \nglobal networks?  Has it challenged the dominant vision in ways that policy makers can \nunderstand; indeed has \u2018The Information Society\u2019 concept been helpful and if so to \nwhom? Garnham (2000) has concluded that the concept is not helpful if the goal is to \nunderstand the way the actions of people \u2013 both the included and the excluded \u2013 give \nrise to stability or instability in the social order and to changes in the way society \nadvances in line with the specific interests of those wielding power within the capitalist \nsystem. The concept has been instrumental in mobilizing a large number of initiatives \nsupported by those who associate the new ICTs and globally networked information \nwith better prospects for the \u2018best of times\u2019. The concept, and its closely associated \ndigital economy, creative economy, and knowledge society brethren, has stimulated the \nimaginations of investors in hardware, software and content in many ways. There is no \ndoubt that dominant power relations have been challenged in some places and with \nvariable consequences.  This observation is not inconsistent, however, with the fact that \nthere are deeply rooted inequalities in society and that these are not being magically \novercome as a result of a digitally mediated society.  This is so regardless of how often \n 11 \nwe are told that the poor can access new technologies such as mobile phones and many \nother digital artefacts. \n \nIn the next section, I consider perspectives on the economics of \u2018The Information \nSociety\u2019 to demonstrate how these approaches downplay or avoid issues relating to the \ndistribution of power, thereby yielding the dominant vision that suggests that we are all \nindeed on the cusp of the \u2018best of times\u2019.   \n \n4. The Information Society Puzzle  \nEconomists conclude that knowledge creation is an important driver of the economy. \nTypically, they make little distinction between information and knowledge. It is a very \nshort step for them from The Information Society to \u2018The Knowledge Society\u2019, that is, a \nsociety in which new knowledge \u2018fuels\u2019 development.  As David and Foray (2003: 20) \nobserve, \u2018knowledge has been at the heart of economic growth and the gradual rise in \nlevels of social well-being since time immemorial. The ability to invent and innovate, that \nis to create new knowledge and new ideas that are then embodied in products, processes \nand organizations, has always served to fuel development\u2019. \n \nThe emphasis on knowledge-based economic growth reflects an interest in intangible \nsources of economic value as a key driver of the economy. As they go on to say: \n \nThe crux of the issue lies in the accelerating (and unprecedented) speed at which \nknowledge is created, accumulated and, most probably, depreciates in terms of \neconomic relevance and value. This trend has reflected, inter alia, an intensified \npace of scientific and technological progress. \u2026 Knowledge-based activities \nemerge when people, supported by information and communication \ntechnologies, interact in concerted efforts to co-produce (i.e. create and \nexchange) new knowledge. (David and Foray 2003: 20, 27) \n \nInformation is seen here as a prerequisite for knowledge production or co-production. \nThis creates difficulties for the economic analysis of market developments because, from \nan economic vantage point, information has peculiar characteristics compared to tangible \ngoods. Information is intangible, non-rivalrous, and non-excludable.8 Conventional \neconomic models are not designed to take account of these features of information. In \n 12 \nparticular, once information is produced it requires considerable effort to prevent its \nbeing passed on to others. ICTs make the costs of information reproduction negligible, \ncreating a paradox over how to finance its initial (first copy) production costs. Stigler \n(1961: 213) was quick to realize this, advising that \u2018one should hardly have to tell \nacademicians that information is a valuable resource: Knowledge is power. And yet it \noccupies a slum dwelling in the town of economics\u2019. As the Internet has become the site \nof commercial activity, the argument that information is an \u2018experience good\u2019 has been \npopularized in the economics and management literatures, notably by Shapiro and Varian \n(1999) in their book Information Rules. Thus, exclusion from participation in the benefits \nof \u2018The Information Society\u2019 is manifested as the absence of experience.  For most \neconomists this problem is addressed over time by the diffusion of the new technologies; \nit is not related to the likelihood of the reproduction of unequal power relations in \nsociety. \n \nWithout a vocabulary or model for considering power relations, economists turn instead \nto the factors that lead to increases in productivity, that is, to the possibility of producing \nmore with constant capital and labour inputs.  They seek to understand how technologies \nmight be implicated in this. Increasing productivity is sufficient for economic growth, a \ncentral goal (or bias) of capitalist societies.  ICTs are thought to play a special role \nbecause these technologies can be employed in many different contexts \u2013 across all \nsectors of the economy. They are regarded as General Purpose Technologies (GPT) \n(Lipsey et al., 2005).  Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995: 84) suggested that, \u2018most GPTs \nplay the role of \u201cenabling technologies\u201d, opening up new opportunities rather than \noffering complete, final solutions\u2019. Despite this caveat about the incompleteness of \ntechnological solutions, much like earlier technologies with a pervasive effect such as the \nsteam engine and electricity (David 1990), it was assumed by many that the rapid \ndiffusion of ICTs leading to \u2018informatisation\u2019 would result in a boost in productivity \ngrowth.  \n \nOne of the \u2018enabling\u2019 features of ICTs for economists is their contribution to the \nincreasing codification of information. Making little distinction between information and \nknowledge, it is argued that by codifying information in digital form, new knowledge can \nbe circulated more widely, thereby \u2018fuelling\u2019 growth and economic development.  Some \ninsist that these opportunities imply new styles of learning, while others stress the \n 13 \nimportance of tacitness (i.e. knowing more than one can say) and the continuing need for \nsupport to those who can now access digital information in new ways (see Antonelli et al. \n2000; Steinmueller 2000; Johnson et al. 2002 and Cowan et al. 2000 for the debates on \nthese issues among economists). Once again, however, without a theory of the social \nprocesses of learning, or indeed, of individual cognitive processes, the economists are \nunable to do more than assert that certain transformations towards greater inclusiveness \nare possible. \n \nIn the contexts of these intellectual traditions, the \u2018The Information Society\u2019 vision \nremains problematically in the forefront of debate. Empirical evidence suggests that there \nare pronounced differences in the economic performance of countries which cannot be \nexplained fully by differences in their levels of investment in digital technologies. Solow \n(1987: 36) said that \u2018you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity \nstatistics\u2019, leading to a debate among economists on the sources of productivity \nimprovement (see Abramovitz and David 1996, Gordon 2004, Jorgenson and Stiroh \n2000). Some, such as Brynjolfsson and Hitt ( 2003) in the United States and Bloom and \nVan Reenen ( 2007) in Britain, have sought explanations for these different performances \nin enterprise-level data, identifying the contribution of specific business processes to \ntheir economic performance \u2013 instead of focusing on aggregate economic performance \ndata. Their work suggests that the context of organizational structure and process does \nindeed influence developments in the economy associated with ICTs.   \n \nResearch closely associated with the economics discipline, and which is very central to \nthe field of science and technology studies, analyses how technological innovations lead \nto shifts in technological \u2018style\u2019 or in \u2018techno-economic paradigm\u2019 (see Freeman et al. \n1982, Freeman 1988; Freeman and Soete 1990a, 1997 and Perez 1985). This work seeks \nto explain why changes in technologies may have destabilizing effects on the economy. \nThese authors suggest that as a new technology spreads, a new \u2018common sense\u2019 starts to \ntake hold that eventually pervades all aspects of individual and institutional endeavour. \nChange may be disruptive, resulting in the obsolescence of skills and qualifications, and \nwealth creation for some as well as new means of exclusion for others. However, the \nfoundations of this work in the economics discipline means that there are very limited \nconceptual tools to enable them to explain what this new \u2018common sense\u2019 implies for \nindividuals or groups, or, indeed, why this common sense might be contested.   \n 14 \n \nNone of these approaches explicitly discuss power relations.  As a result, although they \ndo embrace departures from a normative vision in which all contributors to \u2018The \nInformation Society\u2019 do so from a \u2018level playing field\u2019, they have no theoretical means of \ntackling the political, economic, social and cultural dynamics that yield distorted and \ninequitable relations as a result of the production and consumption of technologies and \ninformation services.  Insofar as such distortions are variable in their intensity, they \ngenerally do not consider the differences among so-called information societies. \nWhen we turn to scholarship that draws upon various social theories, there is much \ngreater scope to develop differentiated understandings of the dynamics of information \nsocieties and to begin to unravel some aspects of the puzzles that challenge the \neconomists.  \n \n5. Information Societies \nA more differentiated set of expectations about the emergence of information societies is \nembraced by scholarship that focuses on the social order and only then on the mediating \nrole of digital technologies.  Considerably before the Internet began to be associated with \nthe transformative potential of ICTs, for example, Murdock and Golding (1989) noted \nthe tendency to assume that the spread of market-oriented communication and \ninformation systems is related to an enlarging of the space for people to make choices \nabout their lives and to exercise control in ways that are empowering. More recently this \nassumption is visible in the promise of Web 2.0 applications from Facebook to Flickr or \nthe iPhone.  Developments in behavioural economics and targeted advertising are being \nused to extend the reach of commerce into the online spaces created by the Internet and, \narguably, little is being done to keep these commercial forces at bay.9  Although these \ndevelopments are discussed by scholars within the field of political economy (Van \nCouvering 2010), they are largely ignored by those who focus on other features of \ninformation societies such as the potential for personal development and new forms of \nidentity formation. Countless virtual community websites cater to an enormous variety of \nhuman interests. Blogging creates opportunities for online publishing and debate, 10 \nonline gaming involves distant and proximate players, and the use of avatars in virtual \nspaces, such as Second Life, offers huge potential especially for those with the skills to \nco-produce their identities and engagements with others.11 There is an almost limitless \nopportunity for online experience, assuming a user has access and the resources to enter \n 15 \nwebsites.  But analyses of these opportunities have been only infrequently accompanied \nby assessments as to whether they are unambiguously associated with enhanced human \nwell-being. \n \nFor example, within the framework of psychoanalytic and sociological theory, a mixed \npicture of the relationship between ICTs and empowerment and disempowerment \nemerges. In the 1980s and early 1990s there was a fascination with the virtual worlds in \nwhich identities can be constructed, often to the neglect of the offline environments in \nwhich people live. Sherry Turkle\u2019s (1995) path breaking work, Life on the Screen, focused \non the multiple identities that avatars may assume on behalf of their creators. Her studies \nof users of Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs) were informed by psychoanalytic theory, \ndemonstrating that users of online games cycle through different characters and genders \nas they adopt flexible identities (Turkle 1997). Steinkuehler and Williams (2006) \ninvestigated the \u2018third spaces\u2019 where identity creation occurs online, finding signs of \nflexibility as well as associations with offline experience, but there are no normative \nclaims in these works.  \n \nSome concerns about the implications of the intensity of virtual engagement for social \nand intra-psychic experience are beginning to be voiced. An American psychiatrist, Block \n(2008: 306), for example, argues that \u2018Internet addiction\u2019 merits inclusion in the DSM-V \n[the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s manual listing mental illnesses and diagnoses]. \nThe American Psychological Association has formally acknowledged this category of \naddiction, but others claim that there is no reason to isolate difficulties associated with \nintense Internet use from other kinds of addictions. There are few reliable data in this \narea and claimed associations between intense Internet use and rates of suicide and \ndepression are not easy to verify. Cooper et al.\u2019s (2000) review of studies of online sexual \ncompulsivity, suggest that such behaviour should not be perceived as a major problem. \nSimilarly, Kraut et al. (2002) found that intensive use of the Internet generally is \nconsistent with perceptions of well-being although these findings have been called into \nquestion by Boles et al. (2004) .  Thus, the jury is out on the balance between positive \nand negative intra-subjective experience associated with the information societies \nemerging in different countries and regions around the world.   \n \nSociologists working in the \u2018everyday life\u2019 tradition have made progress in making \n 16 \nconnections between public action and the mediation of life online.  Research in this area \nis concerned with the strategies and tactics of what Certeau called \u2018ways of operating\u2019.  \n \n\u2018These \u201cways of operating\u201d constitute the innumerable practices by means of \nwhich users reappropriate the space organized by techniques of sociocultural \nproduction \u2026to bring to light the clandestine forms taken by the dispersed, \ntactical, and make-shift creativity of groups or individuals already caught in the \nnets of \u201cdiscipline\u201d\u2019 (Certeau, 1984: xiv-xv) \n \nIn this tradition it is acknowledged that \u2018there can be no knowledge of the everyday \nwithout knowledge of society in its entirety\u2019 (Lefebvre (1962\/2002: 4) and so research is \naimed at understanding the contextual relations within which mediation occurs \u2013 how do \nusers re-appropriate and resist dominant visions of the social order that become \nembedded in technological systems? Silverstone (1999), for example, drew on this \ntradition to analyse users\u2019 experiences online, focusing especially on people\u2019s strategies \nand tactics for resisting the producers\u2019 expectations about their appropriation of the new \ndigital technologies (see also Silverstone 1994; Morley and Silverstone 1990; and \nSilverstone and Haddon 1996).  Those who have examined mediation by technical means \noften understand that the consequences of the spread of new technologies are not \nhomogeneous or universal.  Martin-Barbaro\u2019s (2002: 622) claim that \u2018the network society \nis not, then, purely a phenomenon composed of technological connections, but rather \nthe systemic disjunction of the global and the local\u2019, reflects this realization of the \ncomplexity of the mediation process. Within the dynamics of global capitalism there are \nopportunities for social movements to resist dominant visions and the structures of the \nsocial order.  Silverstone argued that \u2018mediated connection and interconnection define \nthe dominant infrastructure for the conduct of social, political and economic life across \nthe globe\u2019 (Silverstone 2007: 26) but he observed that this dominance is neither uniform \nnor without ethical and moral implications.    \n \nIn the sphere of political theory, initially there was optimism that \u2018real world\u2019 democracy \nmight be translated into online democracy: \u2018the public should be able to conduct \nmeetings in cyberspace in ways that are as civil and democratic as in the real world\u2019 \n(Dutton, 1996: 288). The democratizing potential of ICTs is envisaged in Lessig\u2019s (1999, \n2006) argument that software code, embedded in networks, sets limits and constrains the \n 17 \nnorms for information exchange, but that these norms could be established so as to \nprovide a basis for empowerment of individuals. Feenberg (1992: 319) suggests that the \nnew technologies embody a \u2018subversive rationalization\u2019; that is: \u2018individuals who are \nincorporated into new types of technical networks have learned to resist through the net \nitself in order to influence the powers that control it. This is not a contest for wealth or \nadministrative power, but a struggle to subvert the technical practices, procedures, and \ndesigns structuring everyday life\u2019. Similarly, discussions about the potential of e-\ndemocracy often emphasize that online deliberation \u2018could provide a basis for a more \ndialogical and deliberative democracy in place of the dialogue of the deaf which tends to \ncharacterize contemporary political representation\u2019 (Coleman  2005: 177). From a \ndifferent starting point, Dahlgren (2005) argues that the Internet is destabilizing for some \naspects of democratic practice. Research in these traditions employs different theoretical \napproaches to power, yielding varying assessments of the scope for differentiation of \nsocieties which rely in new ways on mediated relationships for the conduct of political \nprocesses.  \n \nFinally, within research traditions that focus on the role of culture, power and language \nwithin dispersed, increasingly networked communities, there is considerable emphasis on \nwhether these developments offer a basis for political action and resistance (Ribeiro, \n1998). Ribeiro, for example, emphasises that the outcomes of cyberactivism are governed \nby power relationships enacted in the \u2018real\u2019, rather than in the cyber, world. Others such \nas Karim (2007) focus on the potential for virtual communities to engage diaspora \ngroups, creating the potential for \u2018globalization from below\u2019.  In addition, regardless of \nwhat kind of ICT mediated platform is in use \u2013 radio or the Internet \u2013 research shows \nthat there is no consistent relationship between the presence of a free and independent \nmedia and the strengthening of civil society in fragile states (James 2004; Putzel and van \nder Zwan 2007). \n \nOverall then, studies of developments linked to information societies that reach beyond \nthe economic paradigm of intellectual work, reveal a very ambiguous, if not \ncontradictory, set of expectations with regard to the interplay between the dynamics of \ntechnological development and social processes. What then can or should be our \nposition as academic commentators on the life and times of \u2018The Information Society\u2019? \nIf we assume that our theories and empirical research do in fact offer a vantage point for \n 18 \nsocial commentary on the policies and practices that \u2018should\u2019 be encouraged, how should \nwe position ourselves with respect to policy debates that invoke this and related \nconcepts? \n \n6. The Policy Consequences  \n \nThere are few instances of convergence between the different approaches to \u2018The \nInformation Society\u2019 in the scholarly literature and there are similarly few signs of cross-\nfertilisation of insights from these traditions when they travel into the policy domain.  \nThe documents issued by policy organisations tend to be bifurcated between those \noffering a normative prescription for the optimal way of capitalizing on the claimed \nbenefits of the production and use of ICTs in line with the dominant vision and those \nchallenging this vision and seeking to acknowledge diversity and redress for processes \nthat result in social exclusion and economic disadvantage (Mansell 2010).  \u2018The \nInformation Society\u2019 concept serves as injunction and prescription for the former and as \na flashpoint for criticism for the latter.  \n \nIn the policy domain, there has been much discussion of the life and times of \u2018The \nInformation Society\u2019 although a great many labels have been applied. In 1980 UNESCO \npublished, Many Voices, One World, the report of its International Commission for the \nStudy of Communication Problems [ICSCP] also known as the MacBride Report (see \nalso Mansell and Nordenstreng 2006; Carlsson 2005), acknowledging the need for critical \nassessment of the way new technologies for information and communication were \nbecoming unequally embedded in society.  By the 1990s, the emphasis started to shift \ntowards knowledge as the main driver of social and economic transformation.  The \nOECD defined a knowledge-based economy as one that is very strongly dependent on \nthe production, distribution and use of knowledge as embodied in human beings and in \ntechnology (OECD 1996), a perspective consistent with the economists\u2019 models.  Later, \nUNESCO (2005: 5) emphasized capabilities and the variety and the plurality of emerging \nsocieties: \u2018knowledge societies are about capabilities to identify, produce, transform, \ndisseminate and use information to build and apply knowledge for human development\u2019.  \n \nNotwithstanding, UNESCO\u2019s effort to encourage a more explicit acknowledgement of \nthe unequal social relations that provide the context for discussion in this area, it is \u2018The \n 19 \nInformation Society\u2019 concept that informs most programmes of action sponsored by the \ndonor community and development agencies. Debates about the need to envisage more \ninclusive online spaces for dialogue and to facilitate action, vacillate between optimism \nand pessimism. It was optimism about the potential of ICTs to be used to reduce \npoverty that led to the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in 2003 and \n2005. Many countries have been encouraged to prepare strategies to encourage the \ndevelopment of \u2018The Information Society\u2019 within their boundaries. The WSIS Action \nPlan on the Information Society12 and the initiative of GAID (Global Alliance for ICT \nand Development),13 are two of the more visible interventions.  Most of these initiatives \nrely on market-led investment strategies, disproportionately seek to act on the insights of \nadvisors from the \u2018Global North\u2019, and follow a strongly technology-led agenda.  \n \nScholars including Hamelink (2004) and Splichal (2006) concluded that the hegemony of \nthe dominant vision of \u2018The Information Society\u2019 persists with little opportunity in policy \nforums to enable the voices of civil society representatives and critical scholars to be \nheard \u2013 though here too there are some who are more optimistic about the opening of a \ndialogue to a multi-stakeholder community (Calabrese 2005). Many policy measures \ndesigned to encourage progress towards \u2018The Information Society\u2019 are influenced by neo-\nliberal assumptions about the need for \u2018free\u2019 markets and for \u2018light touch\u2019 regulation \n(Mansell 2001, 2006). Despite the fact that ICTs are acknowledged as a target area in the \nMillennium Development Goals,14 policies show few signs of opening a space for \n\u2018alternative pathways\u2019 (Lugo and Sampson 2008) towards information societies. \n \nMany discussions about the digital divide tend to emphasise dualisms (e.g. information \n\u2018haves\u2019 and \u2018have nots\u2019), without addressing the structural dynamics and power relations \nthat influence the terms upon which people are able to participate in their information \nsocieties (Mansell 2002). Warschauer (2004) calls for an analytical framework that focuses \non social inclusion and van Dijk\u2019s (2005) and Norris\u2019s (2001) work, for example, \nhighlights the need for comparative research to examine the underlying dynamics of \ndifferentiation within and between information societies.  \n \nIn the absence of agreement about the normative foundations for information societies, \nit may be that policy makers can benefit from research findings that enable them to \narticulate alternatives to the dominant perspective. Garnham (1997), for example, turned \n 20 \nto the economist, Sen\u2019s (1999) work on capabilities and the choices people can exercise \nin their lives, as the basis for decisions about whether to intervene in market-led \ndevelopments.  In this context, the emphasis is on the multiple ways in which \ninformation societies might contribute to the well-being and achievements of human \nbeings.15 Garnham suggested that as connectivity to networks becomes essential to \npeople\u2019s abilities to conduct their lives, there will be a requirement for some kind of \nregulatory intervention in the interest of fairness and equity. Unfortunately, insofar as \nthere are discussions of fairness and equity, the discussion has focused on access to \ntechnology and rarely on the kinds of well-being and potentials for achievement that are \nfostered.  And, as the Internet spreads and digital platforms (mobile phones) of all kinds \nbecome more accessible, it becomes more difficult to argue for policy or regulatory \nintervention as the neoliberal agenda envelops the new technologies as being progressive \nin every way (Couldry 2003).  \n  \nThere are ongoing discussions about the need for formal regulation (or informal co- or \nself-regulation) of the Internet.  In western countries, formal regulation is rarely attractive \nbecause of the prevailing view that the development of the Internet (The Information \nSociety) requires unrestricted experimentation and an open space in which voluntary \ncontributions can be made. This area is dominated by claims about the importance of \n\u2018Net neutrality\u2019, that is, the retention of a network architecture that does not privilege or \ndiscriminate among content and applications, rather than by debates about the public\u2019s \ninterest in various types of content or services (see Bar et al. 2000; Owen 2007). Net \nneutrality invokes the idea that the Internet should be available to all on a uniform, non-\ndiscriminatory basis without differentiation in terms of quality of service; that is, it \nshould be a transparent, end-to-end network. But as McChesney (1996) argues, the \nInternet is not neutral because developers and users include large commercial companies. \nInsofar as it is these companies that set policy and practice with respect to issues of \nprivacy, security, and copyright and related issues, there are often good grounds for \npolicy or regulatory intervention. Self-regulation by Internet service providers, such as \nthat encouraged by the UK\u2019s Internet Watch Foundation16 which aims to reduce illegal \nchild abuse images and other threats,17 continues to be discussed, but such debates \nfrequently are conducted within the framings offered by \u2018The Information Society\u2019 \nvision.18  \n \n 21 \nIf greater emphasis on human well-being within differentiated information societies is to \nbe present in policy debates and to inform the actions of the many actors who influence \nthe formation of our societies, then attention must be given to how, and to what extent, \ninformation and communication-related rights are being respected. The adoption of the \nUnited Nations Charter in 1945 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UN \nUDHR) in 1948 obliged all States to establish, protect and enforce human rights at the \nglobal, regional, national and local levels. Article 19 of the UN UDHR declares that:  \n\u2018Everyone has the right to freedom of expression and opinion; this right includes the \nfreedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart \ninformation and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers\u2019. There is a strong \nrelationship between recognition of the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights \nof all people and their right or entitlement to participate in information societies.19 The \nquestion therefore should be - what legal and other conditions are constraining different \nsocial groups from attaining the capabilities for shaping their information societies? \n \nThis is a fundamental question that deserves further conceptual elaboration \u2013 what are \nthe implications of the rights-based discourse in different societal contexts? Does this \ndiscourse focus too much on the individual and insufficiently on the potential of \norganised social movements to resist dominant discourses and exclusively market-led \ndevelopments? Arguments are needed in support of the diversity of information societies \nfrom multiple perspectives, not only from the standpoint of the legal discourse on \nindividual human rights or from the standpoint of a single discipline such as economics \nand its concern with market-led and technology biased solutions to economic growth.  In \nrecent years, The Information Society (or knowledge-based economy) vision has been \nchallenged for its neglect of broader considerations of well-being or happiness \n(Englebrecht 2007, 2009). Considerations of happiness offer a subjective evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s condition in the world that reaches beyond production and the money \neconomy to consider peoples beliefs and the things that they value.  In this area, efforts \nare being devoted to the development of metrics to assess national happiness and the \nresults suggest that increasing wealth is related in complicated ways to measures of \nhappiness.20 In this work we find economists turning to insights from the psychology \ndiscipline to understand the complexity of societies and the information base that can \nbest serve decision makers who seek to guide them.   \n \n 22 \nOthers go further to challenge the academy and decision makers to eschew the rationality \nand objectivity of (social) science and to draw insight from traditions that value wisdom.  \nThis work is concerned with ethical practice or practical wisdom, drawing upon the \nclassics including the Aristotelian concept of phronesis, and arguing that in the context \nof management and organisational learning, a more humanistic epistemology is needed to \nensure that choices that affect the lives of all people are informed by wisdom and ethical \nvirtue (Rowley and Gibbs 2008, Rooney and McKenna 2005, 2008).  These approaches \ndo not lend themselves easily to the quantifiable metrics so valued by those who are \nguiding society.21  Although these approaches offer interesting reflections on the \nrelations between, and valuations of, the information \u2013 knowledge \u2013 wisdom nexus, they \ndo not easily offer an answer to questions about whose wisdom or insight is to count or \nmatter insofar as there may be multiple contending priorities for investment and action.  \nThis brings us to the question of whether there is evidence of any greater receptivity to \nthose who want to put the case for a more variegated, pluralistic and open vision of \nsocieties which does not presume that investment in ICTs and information or knowledge \ncreation, following the dominant models developed in the \u2018Global North\u2019, are the \nsolutions to persistent human disadvantage and poverty. \n \n \n7. Conclusion \n \nWhether the opportunities created by the spread of digital technologies make a beneficial \ndifference in people\u2019s lives in the future will be strongly influenced by the extent to \nwhich the dominant vision of \u2018The Information Society\u2019 is successfully challenged in \nways that reach out to those best-positioned to formulate policy and decide on \ninvestment strategies with respect to technology and with respect to the cultural and \nsocial contexts of their uses. Scholars who regard themselves as legitimate participants in \ndomains of policy or practice \u2013 as more than spectators \u2013 may criticize the \u2018The \nInformation Society\u2019 vision and argue that it misleads or even averts our gaze from the \ndynamics of the economy and society that give rise to inequality and exclusion, but we \ncannot ignore it.  The consequences of this vision are playing themselves out in people\u2019s \nlives, often producing new articulations of inequality.  We need to know why and how \nthis occurs so that resources can be mobilized to reduce the social, political and \neconomic harms that emerge. We need to challenge the prevailing \u2018common sense\u2019 or \n 23 \n\u2018wisdom\u2019 to consider a broader range of alternatives than those normally considered \nwithin the framework of \u2018The Information Society\u2019 vision. \n \nProponents of alternative visions of information societies will continue to struggle to \nconvince decision makers \u2013 in policy forums and in the commercial world - that \nasymmetrical relationships perpetuated by the \u2018The Information Society\u2019 vision are \nreplicating relations of inequality and injustice. Challenges to this vision inevitably \nthreaten power structures and are often interpreted as threats to the survival of \nincumbent firms, whether in the field of journalism, markets for broadcast or film \nproduction or technology and information services provision.   \n \nSocieties in the 21st century are very fluid and diverse, mediated increasingly by networks \nunderpinned by convergent ICTs. In challenging \u2018The Information Society\u2019 vision it is \nimportant to ensure that we do not become caught between the rejection of  \u2018a \nhegemonic Eurocentrism\u2019 (Dirlik 2004: 146), that is, a view informed by the principles \nand common sense norms consistent with the experience of the \u2018Global North\u2019, and a \nreactionary localism that rejects developments in ICTs and all digital sources of \ninformation, espoused in the name of the \u2018Global South\u2019. In imagining information \nsocieties that foster greater efficacy, social justice, and well-being, analysis should focus \non the values informing initiatives to build these societies. The fact that such values are \ncontested needs to be acknowledged much more explicitly than is typically done in policy \ndebates today.22  \n \nIs this feasible in the light of the hegemonic position of the dominant \u2018Information \nSociety\u2019 vision? There are some signs in the policy and donor communities of a growing \ncuriosity about context-sensitive and enabling approaches to the development of \ninformation or knowledge based societies. It is unclear whether this is a reflection of \ngrowing pressures to demonstrate effectiveness and impact as a result of investment in \nICT-related programmes, or a recognition of the merits of the arguments offered by \ncritical scholars whatever their disciplinary attachments. The Dutch-funded International \nKnowledge Management Emergent Programme, for instance, has encouraged \nresearchers to put issues of power, information and multiple knowledges at the heart of their \nwork,23 insisting on the plurality of visions about future information societies and on a \ndialogue about the \u2018common sense\u2019 or values that people wish to give priority to.24 \n 24 \nAlthough programmes of this kind are developing in the margins of development \ninitiatives that consider the role of ICTs and information societies, the shift in emphasis \nsuggests that there are opportunities for scholars who are critical of the dominant vision \nto be heard in forums that were less receptive in the past. \n \nAs long as the emphasis is primarily on \u2018The Information Society\u2019 with an accent on \nmarket valuations, the dominant vision will flourish, camouflaging the underlying \ndynamics of social and economic change and fostering the exclusion of those who are \nnot privileged with the resources to benefit from the opportunities that are becoming \navailable to them. However, despite the attraction of historical determinations that might \nsuggest to some that decades of over-emphasis on a progressive, linear, stage-oriented \nmodel of \u2018The Information Society\u2019 cannot be challenged except through recourse to \nstudies of individual learning processes, there are analytical approaches that emphasise \nvalues aimed at enhancing human well-being and inclusivity, without presuming that \ninclusivity in a homogeneous \u2018Information Society\u2019 is to be valued by everyone. A \nrenewed commitment to critical assessment of \u2018The Information Society\u2019 is essential if \nwe are to see that technologies only provide the stage and some of the sets for the \nenactment of the cultural, social, economic and political \u2018life and times\u2019 of our societies. \n \nIn taking this position, I am not advocating a position similar to that espoused by those \nwho call for a resolution of conflicts over the values that should be embedded in \ntechnologies prior to investment in them in all cases. Especially in the case of the ICTs \nthat underpin today\u2019s economies, this is unrealistic.  My argument is not that we can, or \nnecessarily should, try to halt investment in creative developments in ICTs, pending a \nresolution of such conflicts.  Instead, we should acknowledge that there are contested \nvalues and interests in the kinds of information societies that different groups and \nindividuals are promoting.  As we argued (Mansell and Steinmueller 2000: 462),  \n \nA principal aim of social science investigation is to illuminate processes that \nwould otherwise be obscured by common habits of thought or belief.  Our \nanalysis has demonstrated the value of shifting the perspective away from the \nsupply of new technologies and from a concern with the economic determinants \nof diffusion and assessments of social and economic impact.  Instead, we have \ndeveloped our analysis with a focus on uses and users and on the economic, \n 25 \nsocial, technological and institutional issues surrounding participation in the \ninformation society.   \n \nThe polarisation of views between the \u2018worst\u2019 and the \u2018best\u2019 of times, between utopians \nand dystopians, between those who envisage many benefits for all in virtual worlds and \nthose who resist the dominant vision, is unhelpful.  More productive is a view that \nacknowledges that we are involved in neither a revolutionary digital era nor in an era of \nstraightforward incremental change and continuity with the past.  Norms, values, \nconventions and aspirations for the societies within which we live are changing, but they \nare not changing autonomously in response to the technologies of \u2018The Information \nSociety\u2019.  They are changing in response to human actions and decisions that are \nongoing, contested and uneven in their outcomes.  This is so despite the persistence of \nthe voices of those who promote the singular, universalising vision of the \u2018best of times\u2019.  \nAcknowledgement of this within the corridors of power may open up greater \nopportunities to admit \u2018evidence\u2019 from those whose analytical frameworks differ from \nthe relatively narrow focus of the economists and mathematicians on information \nprocessing and control systems. These differ little in their epistemological foundations \nfrom the early, linear, \u2018S-R\u2019 theories of the 1940s and 50s. It surely is time to move on to \nwork with the insights of those drawing upon a more varied set of analytical traditions. \n \n \nReferences \nAbramovitz, M. and David, P. A.

I am grateful to two anonymous referees for their \ncomments. \n2 Eighty-six of these works were included in edited volumes under the title, The Information Society (Critical \nConcepts in Sociology), see Mansell (2009). \n3 In this paper, I do not consider the large literature which focuses mainly on how individuals and \norganisations learn or on the values they may have which inform their learning process. \n4 Bell is credited with having introduced the term Information Society. \n5 The term first coined by Lewis (1948) in his America and Cosmic Man. \n6 The title of The Information Society (Mansell 2009) was proposed initially as Information Societies before \nsigning a contract with the publisher in recognition of the diversity of societies in which information and \ncommunication play significant roles.  That title was reviewed by the editorial group and rejected on the \ngrounds that it was inconsistent with maximising marketing advantage. \n7 See also Miles (2005). \n8 There is a long tradition of work in the economics field that has tackled this problem, see Lamberton \n(1971, 1984) for example. \n9 There is legislation in most countries with respect to the protection of personal information, but \ninitiatives are being devised to collect data on consumer preferences at the individual level, albeit \nanonymously, without much evidence of resistance on the part of citizens or legislators. \n10 See Brake (2009).  \n11 See Vandergraaf (2009). \n12.

There are aspects of Sen\u2019s approach that need to be developed and critiqued, see, for instance, Clark \n(2005).  \n16 See http:\/\/www.iwf.org.uk\/ (accessed 12\/06\/2010). \n17 In 2008 the EC adopted a proposal continuing its Safer Internet Programme (2009-2013), which \naddresses communications services from Web 2.0 such as social networking, and is aimed at fighting illegal \ncontent and harmful conduct such as grooming and bullying, at \n 38 \n                                                                                                                                            \nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/information_society\/activities\/sip\/programme\/index_en.htm, (accessed \n12\/06\/2010). \n18 See Livingstone (in press) for a comprehensive review of arguments with respect to the protection of \nchildren\u2019s rights. \n19 This relationship was acknowledged in the Millennium Declaration, 18 September 2000, which under \n\u2018V. Human rights, democracy and good governance\u2019 resolves \u2018to ensure the freedom of the media to \nperform their essential role and the right of the public to have access to information\u2019.   \n20 See Layard (2005) and the report of the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance \nand Social Progress (Stiglitz Commission) which argues for the development of measures to assess well-\nbeing and sustainability and a focus on income and consumption rather than production, see summary at \nhttp:\/\/www.stat.si\/doc\/drzstat\/Stiglitz%20report.pdf (accessed 12\/06\/2010). \n21 This work is informed by the work of Maxwell (1984) who argued that human welfare can only be \nimproved by strengthening wisdom, rather than knowledge alone. This work is philosophical in orientation \nand leaves us still with the challenge of deciding whose wisdom is to count. \n22.
