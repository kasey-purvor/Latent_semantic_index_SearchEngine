The study of former ice-mass behaviour may therefore be useful in understanding how \nthese Earth-systems operated in the geological past. Perhaps the most direct evidence available \nfor the study of former glacier dynamics is the sedimentary record left by the ice. Indeed, \ngeological and geomorphological mapping of deglaciated terrains is often used to determine the \nsize and extent, (i.e. the geometry), of both ancient ice masses as well as those that were formerly \nmore extensive (e.g. Sugden, 1977; Thorp, 1986; Van Tatenhove et al., 1996; Clark, 1997; \nAnderson et al., 2002; Evans et al., 2005). In Britain this approach has been employed since the \nearliest recognition of glacial features (Agassiz, 1841; Geikie, 1863; Hinxman et al., 1923; \nCharlesworth, 1955) and has enabled significant advances to be made in our understanding of \nEarth-system processes. More recent developments, in both geological and glaciological sciences, \nhave allowed far more detailed interpretations to be made now than ever before, particularly \nwhen founded on empirical data from field mapping (Benn, 1994; Mitchell, 1994; Merritt et al., \n1995; Lowe & Anderson, 2003; Clark et al., 2004; Glasser & Bennett, 2004). Additionally, field-\nbased reconstructions are often used to inform, test or constrain numerical models (e.g. Van \nTatenhove et al., 1996; Jones, 1998; Golledge & Hubbard, 2005; Hubbard et al., 2005). \n \nOxygen isotope data obtained from Greenland ice cores show that the climate of the northern \nhemisphere oscillated between cold and warm phases throughout the late Pleistocene, giving rise \nto particularly long-lasting cold periods from c. 70\u201357 ka BP (Oxygen Isotope Stage 4) and from \nc. 25\u201315 ka BP (Oxygen Isotope Stage 2) (Dansgaard et al., 1993). Interstadials punctuated these \ncolder spells, most notably prior to c. 90 ka BP and from c. 35\u201328 ka BP, during which \ntemperatures ameliorated slightly, but were still sufficiently low that glaciers would have \nsurvived in the Scottish Highlands (Clapperton, 1997). Palaeoclimatic data based on coleopteran \nand chironomid data from four sites in Britain indicate that even during the Windermere \nInterstadial, (c. 15\u201313 ka BP), the climate affecting Scotland was warm for only a short time \nbefore renewed cooling and instability led to the onset of the Younger Dryas stadial (Mayle et al., \n1999). This period of renewed global cooling was characterized in Scotland by an abrupt c. 8\u2013\n10\u00b0C drop in mean annual temperature at its onset, a subsequent decline in precipitation due to \nsea ice formation during the Stadial, and final rapid warming that terminated the glacial \nreadvance (Benn et al., 1992; Clapperton, 1997; Hubbard, 1999; Isarin & Renssen, 1999). \n \nThis study reports geological and geomorphological field data gathered by the British Geological \nSurvey over the period 2003 \u2013 2006, during the resurvey of part of the western Scottish \nHighlands (Fig. 1), together with the results of sedimentological analyses and palaeoglaciological \nreconstructions. Facies genesis is established by comparison of sedimentary characteristics with \ncontemporary analogues in Iceland and Svalbard and with descriptions of similar deposits in the \nliterature. Together, these data allow a new stratigraphy to be presented and conclusions to be \ndrawn with respect to the former dynamics of the ice masses that overwhelmed this part of the \nwestern Scottish Highlands during both the Main Late Devensian (Late Weichselian, c. 25 \u2013 15 \nka BP) and the Younger Dryas (12.7\u201311.3 ka BP).  \n \nField area  \nThe research is focussed on a large area (960 km2) of the western Scottish Highlands to the south \nof Rannoch Moor and north of Loch Lomond (Figs. 1 & 2 A). The study area is one of steep-\nsided mountains and intervening \u2018U\u2019-shaped valleys (glens), with many mountain tops covered in \nregolith derived from metasedimentary bedrock. Where the regolith mantle has been affected by \nfrost-heave, saturation by rainfall, and gravity, solifluction terracettes have resulted. Exposed \nbedrock is particularly common, with talus aprons or cones developed below most crags. Some of \nthe valleys host a covering of till along their flanks and floors, which varies in thickness from 1 \u2013 \n30 m. In many places the till is overlain by morainic deposits of poorly-sorted sand, gravel and \ndiamicton, which often form elongate boulder-strewn ridges. Glaciofluvial deposits are not \nextensive, and where present are mainly confined to large fans and sparse ice-contact features. \nThe floors of many valleys reflect fluvial activity since deglaciation, and exhibit rock-cut \nchannels, thin bouldery alluvium, or large and extensive terraces of sand and gravel. Peat overlies \nmuch of the ground at both high and low levels, and although generally thin, attains thicknesses \nof up to 3 m in some places. \n[FIGURE 1 HERE] \nPrevious research \nEarly mapping by the Geological Survey (1890 \u2013 1920) focussed on the bedrock geology of the \narea, with limited description of the abundant glacial deposits, their inter-relationships, and their \nassociation with the wide variety of landforms present. Reconstruction of the glacial history was \nattempted for adjoining areas by Hinxman et al. (1923), who recognised that much of the area had \nbeen overwhelmed by ice from Rannoch Moor during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). \nCharlesworth (1955) described the moraines and ice-marginal features of much of the Scottish \nHighlands; in the field area described here he associated these features with the decay of glaciers \nafter his \u2018Highland Readvance\u2019. Sissons (1965) later proposed that the \u2018hummocky moraine\u2019 seen \nin the area resulted from in situ stagnation of glaciers at the end of a renewed phase of glaciation \nafter the Main Late Devensian ice sheet had disappeared. Subsequent mapping has been limited \nto studies that cover smaller parts of the area (Thompson, 1972; Horsfield, 1983; Thorp, 1984, \n1986, 1987, 1991b), and which mainly describe geomorphological rather than sedimentological \nfeatures. Nonetheless, these studies have greatly improved our understanding of the former \nYounger Dryas ice mass that affected the area most recently. Whilst Thompson (1972) favoured a \nvalley-glacier type reconstruction, Horsfield (1983) concluded that the area had been glaciated by \nan invasive ice cap centred on the Etive and Nevis mountains to the north-west. Thorp (1984, \n1986) based his reconstruction on periglacial \u2018trimlines\u2019, and deduced that the ice cap on \nRannoch Moor was relatively thin, restricted in extent, and fed outlet glaciers that together \nformed a mountain icefield. Recently, Golledge & Hubbard (2005) reassessed the area and found \nfield evidence suggesting a thicker Younger Dryas ice cap than proposed by Thorp. The empirical \nreconstruction based on this data finds good agreement with the numerical model of Hubbard \n(1999). \n \nGiven the differing interpretations and the lingering uncertainty surrounding the style and impact \nof Younger Dryas glaciation in the western Scottish Highlands, the intention here is to set out a \nnew stratigraphical framework based on sedimentological classification of the glacial deposits of \nthe study area, and to use this to inform interpretations of former local and regional glacier \ndynamics. \n \n \nMethods \nData capture \nGeomorphological features and interpreted geological boundaries were added to 1:10 000 or 1:25 \n000 scale topographic base maps from the interpretation of 1:24 000 scale monochrome aerial \nphotographs, high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs), and where applicable, Thematic \nMapper satellite imagery. This was achieved either digitally in an onscreen GIS environment, or \nin a more traditional manner using paper map bases. These interpretations were subsequently \nfield-checked by detailed walk-over survey in which lines were modified as appropriate. \nSedimentological data was added to the map based on the availability and accessibility of natural \nsections. The distribution of 53 logged sections is shown on Fig. 2 A, although the many \nhundreds of minor exposures noted on field maps that informed the geological interpretation are, \nfor clarity, not shown. For deposits with consistent matrix colour a Munsell Soil Color chart was \nused (Table 1). \n[FIGURE 2 HERE] \nPSD and XRD analysis \nSamples were collected from four of the key facies described below for X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) \nand Particle Size Distribution (PSD) analysis. Only deposits possessing a relatively homogeous \nmatrix were deemed meaningful for analysis. Samples for XRD analysis were freeze-dried prior \nto grinding in a tungsten-carbide gyromill to produce a fine powder. Discs were prepared of each \npowdered sample using metal mounts, and were analysed using a Philips PW 1800 X-Ray \nDiffractometer to produce diffractograms. Systematic peak-matching against standard spectra \nenabled dominant compounds to be identified. Samples for PSD were taken from wet sediment, \nagitated with sodium hexametaphosphate in an ultrasonic bath to create a suspension of suitable \ndensity, seived to remove the > 900\u03bcm fraction and repeatedly flushed through a Coulter LS100 \nLaser Diffractometer to derive size-frequency data. \n \nResults \nBedrock \nThe underlying strata in the field area are polydeformed Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks \nof the Dalradian Supergroup, which comprise mainly metasandstone and metasiltstone, with less \nabundant interbedded pelitic and calcareous rocks. Deformation of the bedrock has resulted in \nwide variation in its dip and strike, although the regional strike is approximately W \u2013 E in the \nsouth and SW \u2013 NE further north. Bedrock is easily discernable almost everywhere, due to the \nmainly thin covering of superficial deposits. In many places the bedrock is highly abraded, \nsmoothed or polished, reflecting the legacy of successive glacial episodes. Particularly clear \nexamples of ice-smoothed bedrock occur in Lairig Arnan, Gleann nan Caorann, Lairig nan Lunn, \nand Glen Falloch, on cols between Beinn Dorain and Beinn a\u2019 Chreachain, also between Ben Lui \nand Beinn Dubhchraig, and at higher levels on the flanks of mountains south of Glen Falloch \nsuch as Beinn Chabhair, Beinn a\u2019 Chroin and Cruach Ardrain (Fig. 2B). Zones of disaggregated \nbedrock \u2013 where blocks have been detached and moved less than a few 10\u2019s of metres from \nsource outcrops \u2013 occur on some plateau areas between mountain peaks and valley troughs (Fig. \n2B). Where the detached blocks form drumlinoid mounds, the former direction of ice flow can be \ninferred. Erosional landforms such as roches moutonn\u00e9e, P-forms and striae were recorded in \nGlen Falloch, Lairig Arnan, Loch Easan, Glen Lochay, Coire Chailein and Mam Lorn. \n \nGlacial deposits \nSedimentology \nA description of each facies type encountered, their expression and occurence in the study area, \nand their genetic interpretations are presented in Table 1. As no formal stratigraphy exists for the \nstudy area the facies are differentiated on their colour, texture, composition and internal structure, \nand are coded here A \u2013 H. This simple approach enables identification and classification of \ndeposits in the field and allows units to be confidently correlated between exposures. \n[TABLE 1 HERE] \nFacies A, B, C, and D are all well-consolidated generally massive diamictons composed of sand, \nsilt and clay and containing sub-angular and sub-rounded clasts. Facies A, B and D are locally \nweakly stratified, however, and host centimeter to decimeter-scale pods or laterally-impersistent \npartings of silt and fine sand, whereas Facies C is never stratified and has a finer-grained matrix \nthat produces an almost choncoidal cleavage pattern. All of these diamictons are firm or very firm \nbut they differ from one another in their colour and matrix mineralogy. Facies A and B are \nreddish-brown and yellow-brown respectively, and both contain kaolinite. Facies C is blue-grey \nor greenish-grey and contains calcite, whilst Facies D is light olive-brown in colour and contains \nneither calcite or kaolinite. Facies E and F are similarly-coloured diamictons to Facies D but are \nconsiderably less consolidated. They are often stratified, with sand beds up to 1 m thick in Facies \nE and thinner lenses and beds in Facies F. Both diamictons are rich in well-rounded to very \nangular clasts ranging from gravel and cobbles to boulders.  \n \nFacies G comprises a range of grain-sizes but in all instances is characterized by a high degree of \nsize sorting not seen in the other units. Whilst some units are massive, others show primary \nsedimentary structures such as planar bedding, trough cross-bedding or lamination. Facies H is \nidentifiable by the grade of its constituents (boulders) and lack of sedimentary structures. \nDeposits of this facies are commonly very localised and cannot be laterally correlated. In most \ncases, however, the other facies (A \u2013 G) show remarkable inter-site uniformity, and can be traced \nacross the study area relatively easily, although the number of exposures of each unit is widely \nvariable. For example, Facies A and B were only seen in Coire Thoin and Coire Chailein \nrespectively, but the remainder are considerably more widespread (Table 1). Examples of the \nmain facies types and the typical form of ice-smoothed bedrock are shown in Fig. 3A\u2013D, and \nPSD data for Facies A \u2013 D are plotted in Figure 4. \n[FIGURES 3 & 4 HERE] \nStratigraphy \n \nThe sediments described in Table 1 are patchily distributed across the study area, but exposed \nmetasedimentary bedrock is widespread. Whilst most valleys have only thin valley-floor till \ncover, some \u2013 such as Coire Chailein, Coire Thoin, Coire Bhiocair, and Glen Auchreoch \u2013 host \nsediment accumulations up to 30 m thick (Fig. 2B). These thicker sequences provide the basis for \nfacies correlation between sections, and are described in more detail below. \n \nThe section exposed in Coire Chailein is shown in Fig. 5. Although some lateral variation occurs, \nthe overall sedimentary sequence can be summarised as follows. The lowest unit, Facies B, is a \n12\u201313m thick, very firm, yellow-brown, sandy diamicton containing subangular and subrounded \nmetasedimentary clasts. This is overlain by a complex sequence of interbedded sand, gravel and \ndiamicton units. These are laterally variable in thickness but include an approximately 1 m thick \nclast-supported predom inantly sub-angular psammite boulder bed, (Facies H), beds of weakly \nstratified sandy and gravelly diamicton up to 1 m thick (Facies F), and an overlying unit of \nlaminated clay, silt and trough-cross-bedded sand 1\u20132 m thick (Facies G). In places the bedded \nsand exhibits centimetre-scale faults and folds. Overlying the sand is weakly stratified gravel that \ngrades upward into gravelly diamicton (Facies F), which is then overlain by 8 m of grey, clayey \ndiamicton (Facies C), and firm, brown, diamicton (Facies D). \n[FIGURE 5 HERE] \nThe dominant sediment exposed in Coire Thoin is Facies A \u2013 a cohesive diamicton that in a \nweathered section appears uniformly reddened, but when dug becomes increasingly yellow-\nbrown with depth. The diamicton is sandier and more clearly stratified higher up, and is overlain \nby Facies C diamicton. In Coire Bhiocair the sedimentary infill is poorly-exposed, but appears to \nconsist predominantly of Facies D diamicton. In Glen Auchreoch and Gleann nan Caorann \nconformable sequences of Facies C and D up to 10 m thick are preserved, the two units separated \nby abrupt, sub-planar contacts.  \n \nSmaller exposures elsewhere are also instructive. In Glen Lochy Facies D is overlain by up to 5 m \nof stratified sandy, unconsolidated diamicton (Facies E) containing discrete sand beds up to 1 m \nthick. In Cononish Glen and Gleann Auchreoch, moraines are composed of Facies F stratified \ndiamictons that dip up-valley, host numerous folded and faulted sand and silt laminae or beds, \nand in upper Cononish Glen are overlain by Facies G fines. Elsewhere, such as in Balquhidder \nGlen, Glen Lyon, and Glen Falloch, Facies G is intercalated with laterally impersistent and \nvariably thick diamictons of Facies F. \n \nFacies occurence and spatial distribution \nFigures 6A\u2013C show, respectively, scaled logs of the principal exposures in the study area, inter-\nsite correlation of units, and, based on these, the first composite glacial stratigraphy for the \nregion. Note that in many cases there may be several units of the same facies present, \nrepresenting a stratified deposit that records episodic deposition. In Figure 6A the logs are \ngrouped according to the facies present at each locality in order to facilitate comparison. The \nhorizontal \u2018baseline\u2019 divides deposits interpreted as Younger Dryas in age from those deemed \nolder (cf. Table 1). \n \nFrom Fig. 6A it is apparent that Facies A and B are each only found at one locality, in glens \nwhere their preservation suggests that former ice flow was oblique to the valley axis (Golledge, \n2007b). In both cases the diamictons occur at the base of the preserved sequences, and are \noverlain by Facies C. The latter is more widespread than either Facies A or B, but its occurence is \nnonetheless restricted to isolated \u2018pockets\u2019, such as near Ben Glas, in Gleann nan Caorann, \nGleann Auchreoch, Gleann a\u2019 Chlachain, Coire Thoin and Coire Chailein. Facies D is ubiquitous \nand is generally the dominant deposit in most glens. \n[FIGURE 6 HERE] \nLandform-sediment assemblages \nNeither Facies A or B are associated with any characteristic topographic expression, but Facies C \n& D commonly form both smooth valley-side veneers and compose large, broad, ridges. Facies E \ndrapes many of these larger ridges, and also composes irregular moundy spreads. The latter are \noften characterized by abrupt transitions from diamicton to fines, and in many cases exhibit \ncomplex faulting and folding. Whilst compositionally similar, Facies F tends to form distinct \nsharp-crested moraines, and thus the two facies can be differentiated on the basis of their \nlandform-sediment assemblage and mapped separately. Since these moraines have important \nimplications for reconstructing former glacier dynamics, they are considered in more detail \nbelow. \n \nMoraines include all ridges interpreted to result from direct formation by glacier ice, whether \ntheir origin is primarily subglacial (e.g. ribbed moraine), or subaerial (e.g. latero-frontal moraine). \nThose in the study area can be classified into three types: \n \nType 1 moraines are typically broad-crested, relatively smooth features that may be > 10 m high \nand 10\u2019s \u2013 100\u2019s metres in length (Fig. 7). Some are bedrock-cored, and may show alignments \nsimilar to the structural trend of the underlying strata, for example northwest of Loch Tulla (Fig. \n2B). Many Type 1 features, however, are largely composed of cohesive diamictons of Facies C \nand D, and may host superficial drapes of more friable Facies E or F diamicton, as well as one or \ntwo scattered boulders on their crests. The best examples of these moraines occur in an extensive \nsub-parallel suite that trends approximately west-east in an arcuate belt 2 \u2013 3 km wide, at a height \nof 350 \u2013 550m a.s.l. on the undulating plateau area south of Ben Lui and Beinn Dubhchraig (Fig. \n2B). Landforms within this assemblage, particularly at the western and eastern margins of the \nplateau, show superimposed lineations that cross-cut or distort their  \u2018parent\u2019 ridges. Suites of \noverridden or streamlined landforms also occur around Loch Easan (Fig. 2B) and Coire \nEoghannan (Golledge & Hubbard, 2005). \n \nType 2 moraines are generally < 10 m high and up to a few 10\u2019s metres in length, exhibit sharp \ncrests, and are often arcuate across valley floors (Fig. 7). They are predominantly composed of \nstratified or interdigitated units of Facies F (sandy diamicton) and G (bedded or laminated clay, \nsilt and sand). Contacts between units may be either conformable and planar, or erosive and \nirregular. In a number of cases small faults, thrusts or folds may be seen, reflecting low strain \ndeformation. The most well-developed moraines occur at the east end of Cononish Glen (Fig. \n2B). The abundant steep-sided mounds are typically concave on their north and northeastern \nsides, and where exposures exist, often exhibit generally southward-vergent glaciotectonic \nstructures. Further west in Cononish Glen abundant moraines occur on the northern valley side, \nbut not on the southern side. Again, vergence of glaciotectonic structures is to the south or \nsouthwest. Many of the valley floor moraines near the western end of the glen are composed of \nstratified diamictons whose architecture is consistently dominated by westward-dipping very \nclast-rich subunits. Gleann Auchreoch, a tributary of Glen Cononish, hosts well-developed \nmoraines along much of its valley floor. Many of the other glens mapped host at least some Type \n2 morainic landforms - other good examples can be seen in upper Auch Gleann, Coire Thoraidh, \nand Gleann a\u2019 Chlachain. \n[FIGURE 7 HERE] \nType 3 moraines are boulder ridges (Fig. 7). These landforms are considerably less abundant than \neither Type 1 or 2 moraines, and are most prevalent in glens of the Beinn Chabhair \u2013 Ben More \nmassif, south of Glen Falloch and Glen Dochart. In lower Coire Earb, for example, low boulder \nridges < 5 m high descend the valley sides in arcuate nested groups that can be traced up-valley to \nthe former glacier source area of Beinn a\u2019 Chroin. Type 3 moraines are predominantly composed \nof locally-derived large boulders, but may overlie diamictons of Facies D or incorporate units of \nFacies F or G. \n \nGlaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits (Facies G) rarely form distinct landforms in the study \narea, but bedded or laminated fine-grained sediments were often found on-lapping, overlying or \nintercalated with the morainic deposits. In Coire Chailein, Facies G silt and clay units are buried \nand have no surface expression. In most other cases, however, these sediments form flat terraces \nlocated in either intra-moraine areas, or are contiguous with moraines. For example, in Coire Earb \nFacies G sand and silt form a flat-topped gently north-sloping glaciolacustrine delta. Bedded sand \nwas noted in two places in upper Glen Cononish: dipping south into the hillside north of Ben Oss, \nand dipping northwestward (up-valley) below Ben Lui. Glaciofluvial fans and terrace remnants \nwere mapped in Glen Orchy, in Strathfillan, and near the head of Loch Lomond. Exposures in \nStrathfillan reveal southward-dipping bedded sand, and laminated silt and clay. Ice-contact \nglaciofluvial mounds were recorded near Bridge of Orchy and amongst the moraines at Dalrigh, \ndistinguished by their well-sorted composition. \n \n \nInterpretation: facies genesis \n \nThe accuracy of any glacier reconstruction depends to a large extent on the accurate interpretation \nof sedimentological and stratigraphic evidence in a landform-sediment and process-form context. \nMany recent studies have reviewed the common nomenclature of glacigenic sediments, and with \nvarying scales of focus, have attempted to refine the theories on which genetic interpretations and \nfacies classifications are based (Menzies, 1989; Benn & Evans, 1996; Kr\u00fcger & Kj\u00e6r, 1999; \nPiotrowski et al., 2004; Menzies et al., 2006; Evans et al., 2006).The sedimentological character, \nstratigraphic relations and landform context of the bedrock features and glacial sequences in the \nwestern Scottish Highlands are compared below with these studies, and where appropriate, with \nmodern examples. \n \nAlthough potentially classifiable as \u2018M\u2019 beds (Menzies, 1989), \u2018deformation till\u2019 (Benn & Evans, \n1996), \u2018tectomict\u2019 (Menzies et al., 2006), or \u2018traction till\u2019 (Evans et al., 2006), Facies A \u2013 D are \nsimply considered here to be of unspecified subglacial origin, for the following reasons: they \ncontain predominantly subangular and subrounded clasts that are often striated, and have a silt \nand sand-dominated matrix showing a bimodal grain-size distribution. They are very firm in \noutcrop and closely resemble subglacial till observed at modern glacier margins (e.g. Fig. 8A). \nFacies E is similar in composition but is very poorly consolidated. On this basis it is interpreted as \n\u2018submarginal\u2019, that is, largely derived by reworking of underlying substrates by the glacier sole \nand by the addition of \u2018new\u2019 material melting-out subglacially, in a manner similar to that shown \nin Figure 8B. Although such deposits have relatively poor preservation potential compared to \nmore consolidated substrates (Evans et al., 2006), they are found in a number of locations in the \nstudy area (Fig. 6A). The presence of planar-bedded sand and silt inclusions within units of \nFacies E argues against these units having been pervasively deformed either during or after \ndeposition (Piotrowski et al., 2001). \n \nThe stratigraphic position of Facies A and B, together with their very limited preservation and, in \nthe case of Facies A, the presence of clay minerals typical of long-term weathering (kaolinite), \nsuggests that these sediments relate to a significantly earlier phase of glaciation than the one that \ndeposited the more widespread units higher in the sequence. Although distinguished by slight \ncolour differences, Facies A and B are likely to be the same unit, since they share many common \ncharacterisics (grain size, composition, mineralogy) and are stratigraphically equivalent. \n \nSince Facies C has a silt and clay (rock flour) matrix and is very firm, it is interpreted as the \nproduct of bedrock erosion by plucking or micro-fracturing (sensu Hutter & Olunloyo, 1981). \nThis process requires intimate ice-bedrock contact and only sufficient basal meltwater to facilitate \nsliding. Lower effective overburden pressures (whether due to more basal meltwater or thicker \nunconsolidated basal substrate) would have prevented such effective bedrock erosion. It is thus \ninferred that this high shear strength, low permeability grey till is the product of a thick, relatively \ncold-based, and hence slowly-moving ice mass that transported the material englacially (Fig. 8C \n& D). \n[FIGURE 8 HERE] \nFacies C and D are almost identical in terms of their structure, clast content, and composition, \ndiffering only in their matrix grain size and colour. They are never separated by intervening units \nand the colour contrast is often abrupt and, for example near Ben Glas (Fig. 2A), cross-cuts \nindividual clasts (Golledge, 2007a). Metasedimentary bedrock underlies the majority of the field \narea and thus, even if changes in ice-flow direction and concomitant sediment provenance \noccurred, they would be unlikely to produce debris of significantly different colour. Since the \ncolour change is seen to cross-cut individual clasts, a plausible explanation may be that the red-\nbrown colour of Facies D reflects a greater concentration of ferrous oxides, produced by \npostdepositional weathering. Facies C and D can thus be interpreted as pertaining to the same \nglacial advance, an inference supported by interpretations of similar grey\u2013brown till sequences in \nCanada (Hendry et al., 1984), Sweden (Lagerb\u00e4ck, 1992), Estonia (Rattas & Kalm, 2001), \nDenmark (Christoffersen & Tulaczyk, 2003) and England (Madgett, 1975; Madgett & Catt, \n1978). These diamictons constitute many of the thickest and most widespread exposures in the \narea, and compose many of the large Type 1 moraines, consistent with deposition beneath a well-\nestablished and long-lived ice sheet such as the one known to have existed in Britain during the \nMain Late Devensian. \n \nFacies E is widespread in its occurence, is spatially variable in its composition, and is generally \nless well-consolidated than the Facies D diamicton that it overlies. The presence of bedded sand \nand silt, conformably stratified within units of Facies E, suggest that these sediments were \ndeposited by flowing water. The presence of well-rounded as well as angular cobbles indicates \nthat debris was derived from both subglacial and supraglacial environments, whilst the lack of \ncohesion of Facies E suggests that effective ice overburden pressures were relatively small. \nFacies E may therefore have a complex and variable origin. It is likely that subglacial meltwater \neroded and reworked the underlying till sheet (where present) (cf. Piotrowski & Tulaczyk, 1999), \nthus giving rise to conformable, and in some instances, transitional contacts between Facies D \nand E. This must have occurred subsequent to the emplacement of Facies D, and most likely can \nbe attributed to recycling of the older deposits by the Younger Dryas ice cap. During this \nreadvance, debris melting-out from englacial and subglacial transport (Fig. 8B\u2013E) became \nsuperimposed on these saturated basal sediments, and were patchily intercalated with well-sorted \nmaterial deposited from emerging subglacial streams. The high degree of sorting indicates \nsediment transport as suspended load in water of steady velocity, flowing either in well-defined \nsubglacial channels or through a network of linked cavities. Sheet flow is considered unlikely \ngiven the inherent instability of such systems (Fountain & Walder, 1998). Laterally impersistant \nbedded sand bodies up to 1 m in thickness in Facies E lend support to the notion of low-pressure \ncavities, canals or lakes at the glacier bed, where decreased flow velocities enabled sediment \ndeposition. Such features have been recorded in ancient till sequences elsewhere, for example in \nNorth America (e.g. Clayton et al., 1989). Whilst compositionally similar to Facies F and G that \noverlie it, Facies E commonly exhibits primary sedimentary bedding and rarely shows \nconvolutions and glaciotectonic deformation, suggesting a relatively passive depositional \nenvironment. \n \nMarginal recession accompanying Younger Dryas deglaciation also led to deposition of material \nfrom supraglacial sources in the ice-marginal environment, where debris flows from the ice \nsurface augmented deposits of ablated basal ice (Fig. 8F). These deposits are distinguished here \nas Facies F where they form Type 2 moraine mounds and ridges, comparable to those found at \ncontemporary ice margins (Fig. 8G). These poorly-consolidated heterogenous deposits are \ncommonly associated with retreat of the Younger Dryas ice cap in Scotland, albeit with \ninterpretations of genesis ranging from melt-out of stagnant debris-rich ice to thrusting at the \nmargins of actively retreating glaciers (see Lukas, 2005a,b, for a comprehensive review). Recent \nresearch tends to agree, however, that the abundance and close spacing of such moraine mounds \nare indicative of actively retreating, high mass-turnover ice that is close to equilibrium (Thorp, \n1991a; Benn & Ballantyne, 2005; Benn & Lukas, 2006). \n \nWidespread intercalation of Facies G with Facies F, commonly near the top of the stratigraphic \nsequence, suggests that ice-proximal deposition by glaciofluvial drainage was, at least initially, \ncontemporaneous with ice-marginal debris flows. As sediment supply waned, however, probably \nas a result of ice margin recession, ice marginal ponds developed and accumulated the uppermost \nlaminated and bedded sediments. Facies G in Coire Chailein, however, intervenes between \nsubglacial till units. For this reason is suggested that it was deposited during an early phase of ice \nrecession that enabled sub-aerial deposition of the trough-cross-bedded sand and stratified gravel \nunit, probably in a braided fluvial or ice-marginal glaciofluvial system prior to the Main Late \nDevensian glacial advance. This scenario is corroborated by preliminary results from \nluminescence dating of the sediments (Golledge & Robinson, 2007). \n \nIn summary, it is suggested that Facies A & B pre-date the Main Late Devensian glaciation, that \nFacies C & D are the subglacial product of the MLD glaciation, and that Facies E and surface \noccurences of Facies F were deposited by glaciers of the Younger Dryas readvance. Facies G & \nH occur at different stratigraphic levels within the sedimentary sequence and reflect depositional \nprocesses common to each glacial advance. \n \n Discussion: Glacier dynamics in the western Scottish Highlands \n \nThe sediments and their stratigraphic relations described above enable a composite stratigraphy to \nbe constructed for the first time in this area (Fig. 6C), and allow the following inferences to be \nmade with respect to the evolution of ice masses and former glacier dynamics in the study area. \nAreas of scoured bedrock and the isolated cases of sediment preservation represent opposing end \nmembers of the erosion\u2013deposition continuum, thus their respective distribution can be used to \ninfer basal conditions beneath the ice. \n \nThat scoured or simply bare bedrock surfaces are widespread in the area indicates that the last ice \nto overwhelm the study area \u2013 the Younger Dryas ice cap \u2013 largely rested on a rigid bed. The ice \nmass therefore only flowed over a deformable bed in very restricted portions of the study area, \nand it deposited relatively little substrate during its subsequent retreat. This is consistent with \nmuch of the field area occurring beneath the central portion of the former Younger Dryas ice cap. \nIce-flow during this episode was accomodated in some areas through ice deformation (creep or \nshear) and meltwater lubrication at the ice\u2013bed interface. Where ice deformation was the \ndominant process, flow would have been slow and largely non-erosive, governed mainly by the \ntemperature-dependent creep rate of the ice. The presence of areal bedrock scouring, fluting of \nboth bedrock and unconsolidated deposits, roches moutonn\u00e9e, P-forms, and striae all indicate \nmore rapid ice flow and at least some erosion of the bed (Hall & Glasser, 2003; Roberts & Long, \n2005), suggesting that some parts of the ice cap flowed by meltwater-lubricated basal sliding. \nThis is known to have occurred elsewhere where streamlined bedrock features have been \npreserved (Glasser, 2002; Stoker & Bradwell, 2005; Roberts & Long, 2005). \n \nWhether bedrock smoothing is partially inherited, isochronous, or time-transgressive is difficult \nto determine without, for example, cross-cutting striae. Thus it is not possible from this evidence \nalone to determine the evolution of the basal thermal regime during the lifetime of the Younger \nDryas ice cap, only that it must have been at least partially warm-based at some point, and \nprobably most extensively during the warming period that accompanied deglaciation. This \ninference does not, however, preclude the very likely possibility that flow mechanisms evolved \nthroughout the lifetime of the ice cap. The field evidence is, therefore, a time-transgressive \nassemblage that superimposes features pertaining to the last phase of glacial activity on a pre-\nexisting, Main Late Devensian, landscape. The juxtaposition of scoured bedrock in some areas \nwith preservation of older sediments in others suggests convincingly that processes operating at \nthe glacier bed were spatially (and so probably also temporally) variable, such as is typical of \nglacial environments (Piotrowski et al., 2004). \n \nSutherland (1993) asserted that, \u2018no deposits older than the Loch Lomond Stadial\u2019 are known in \nthis part of the western Scottish Highlands, and thus the recognition of superimposed Main Late \nDevensian landforms, their constituent sediments, and the discovery of two sequences containing \nsediments that even pre-date the Main Late Devensian is particularly significant. Since these \nolder deposits have not been removed, later ice flow in these parts of the study area must have \nbeen accomodated either through ice deformation, sliding, or by deformation of only a thin zone \nof the bed. Deposition of Facies C, a rock-flour dominated subglacial till, reflects intimate ice\u2013 \nbed contact during the build-up of the Main Late Devensian ice sheet (Fig. 9A) which may have \npersisted until glacier sliding was inhibited, perhaps by extreme cold and increased aridity. \nWithout high mass turnover the ice sheet may have become largely immobile in this area and \nprobably frozen to much of its bed. Landscape preservation associated with former frozen bed \nconditions is widely reported from Scandinavia (e.g. Kleman, 1994; Kleman & Borgstrom, 1994; \nKleman & H\u00e4ttestrand, 1999), and thus may be an equally plausible scenario for this central \nportion of the former British Ice Sheet. \n[FIGURE 9 HERE] \nDeposition of subglacial till continued during deglaciation, but, as a result of higher velocity \nmeltwater flow that preferentially removed silt and clay (Alley et al., 1997), was characterized by \na coarser matrix. This subsequently controlled downward migration of the post-depositional \nweathering front that produced the colour contrast that distinguishes Facies D. Areas of scoured \nbedock in the study area may partly have been produced by accelerating ice sheet flow and the \npresence of fast-flowing outlet glaciers during deglaciation, both catalysed by enhanced \nmeltwater-lubricated sliding (Fig. 9B). Together with localised deformation of dilatant \nunconsolidated substrates, this led to dynamic lowering of the ice sheet surface. \n \nWidespread preservation of sediments and the streamlining of Late Devensian landforms in the \nstudy area reflects the restricted basal erosion that took place during the Younger Dryas. This last \nperiod of glaciation also failed to deposit a distinct subglacial till of it own, instead reworking and \nremoulding older sediments. Lenses and beds of sand and fine gravel in Facies E record localised, \npossibly channelised, subglacial meltwater flow, and testify to limited deformation of the \nsubstrate following their deposition. The demise of the Younger Dryas ice cap is thought to have \nresulted from a rapid climatic amelioration that abruptly terminated the steady cooling of the \nearly part of the stadial (Clapperton, 1997; Hubbard, 1999). Non-topographically aligned \nmoraines in many glens provide convincing evidence that the ice mass decayed as a coherent ice \ncap in much of this area, most probably supporting a relatively steep marginal gradient that even \nduring retreat was able to overwhelm topographic barriers (Golledge, 2007b). Glaciotectonic \nindicators in many of the moraines and intercalated outwash deposits attest to the dynamic nature \nof the retreating ice margin, even at this close proximity to its main source areas surrounding \nRannoch Moor. To enable this, the warming climate must have been accompanied by sufficient \nprecipitation to continually nourish the receding ice mass to a level adequate to significantly abate \nsurface lowering.  \n \nThat the uppermost units in many of the recorded sedimentary exposures show laminated or \nbedded fine sediments (Facies G) interdigitated with coarser diamictons (Facies F) may either \nreflect oscillations of the retreating ice margin, or climatically-controlled changes in meltwater \nand concomitant sediment flux. Either way, the abundance of laminated fine-grained sediments in \nmany of the glens indicates that final deglaciation took place in a very wet environment \ncharacterized by widespread ephemeral proglacial ponding (Fig. 9C). Poor connectivity between \nglacial and fluvial systems has been documented in Younger Dryas landsystems elsewhere in \nScotland (Benn & Lukas, 2006), and may be equally applicable here. This is further supported by \nthe relative paucity of glaciofluvial outwash deposits seen in the study area. \n \nFinal disappearance of ice from the study area occurred after 11.6 \u00b1 1.0 ka BP (Golledge et al., \n2007), and may well have broadly coincided with the Younger Dryas climatic termination \nidentified in ice cores at c. 11.3 ka (Alley, 2000). \n \n \nConclusions \n \nGeological mapping, section logging and laboratory analysis has allowed a suite of eight \ndistinctive glacial sediment facies to be identified. This has enabled, for the first time, a coherent \nglacial stratigraphy to be defined for part of the western Scottish Highlands that encompasses \ndeposits spanning three glacial episodes. Widespread preservation of these sediments, and the \nlandforms that they compose, indicates that former ice masses in this area were less erosive than \npreviously envisaged, and that the present landscape constitutes a \u2018palimpsest\u2019 in which features \nof different ages are superimposed. When considered in their proper context, the landsystem \nelements indicate that glacier flow over a deformable bed was considerably more prevalent \nduring the Late Devensian than the subsequent Younger Dryas, when instead ice movement may \nhave been governed to a larger extent by meltwater-lubricated basal sliding. These new insights \ninto the former behaviour of ice masses in the area enable better comparison with deglaciated \nlandscapes elsewhere, and provide a testable model for future glaciological modelling \nexperiments. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nI am especially grateful to Ann Mennim for laboratory assistance, and to Ruth Robinson, David \nSugden and numerous BGS colleagues for useful discussions in the field.

Facies codes after Eyles & \nMiall (1984); Eyles et al. (1984). \n \nFigure 1: Location map showing area of study in Scottish context, and in relation to approximate \nmaximal extent of Younger Dryas ice cover (after Ballantyne, 1997). \n \nFigure 2: A: The study area, showing principal mountains, valleys and water bodies, and the \nlocations of sediment exposures reported here. Digital terrain model built from Intermap \nTechnologies NEXTMap 1.5m resolution topographic data. B: Occurence of key bed-types in the \nstudy area, showing areas of bedrock at or near surface, ice-smoothed bedrock, disaggregated \nbedrock, thick till accumulations, suites and types of moraine. Some generalisation has been \nnecessary and some smaller occurrences are not shown. Erosional landforms such as roches \nmoutonn\u00e9e, P-forms, and striations are shown with arrows indicating the inferred former ice flow \ndirection. Northern and eastern margins show Lat \/ Long; southern and western margins show \nBritish National Grid references. \n \nFigure 3: Field photographs showing A: Facies C and D, B: Facies F and G, C: Facies E and F, \nand D: ice-smoothed metasedimentary bedrock at 560m a.s.l, Glen Orchy (former iceflow \napproximately right to left). \n \nFigure 4: Particle size distribution curves for sub-900\u03bcm fraction of matrix material from Facies \nA \u2013 D, interpreted as subglacial tills. Note the difference between each plot, and the degree of \ninternal consistency. \n \nFigure 5: Sketch of exposure in Coire Chailein, traced from a photo-montage. Section reveals \ncomplex stratigraphy of diamictons (Facies B, C, D, F) interbedded with overridden gravel, sand \nand silt units (Facies G) and a 1m thick boulder bed (Facies H). \n \nFigure 6: A: Compiled logs of sedimentary units at 53 localities in the study area showing the \nrelative thickness of each facies type. B: Correlation of units between sites where the thickest \nsequences were recorded. C: Composite stratigraphy for the whole study area. Note that in A, \nsections NRG152, 160 and 188 are truncated to reduce overall length, and that the scale of logs \nNRG152 and NRG160 is reduced 50% to facilitate display and comparison with others. In C the \nvertical scale is approximate and intended to show typical unit thicknesses for comparison with \neach other. Grain-size depictions are intended to summarize key characteristics of the facies \npresent. \n \nFigure 7: Moraine types and their typical geomorphological context in the study area. \nAnnotations show generalised composition and approximate scale of features. \n \nFigure 8: Examples of facies types, their various transport pathways and depositional \nenvironments at modern glaciers. A: Cohesive subglacial till exposed at the retreating margin of \nSolheimaj\u00f6kull, Iceland. B: Melt-out of subglacial debris from the sole of a retreating glacier, \nSolheimaj\u00f6kull, Iceland. Note the poor sorting and surface cobbles. C: Folded and attenuated \nfine-grained englacial debris bands, Longyearbreen, Svalbard. D: Fine-grained debris bands and \npod of matrix-dominated diamicton probably incorporated subglacially, Longyearbreen, \nSvalbard. E: Angular debris band of coarse clasts and gravelly matrix buried supraglacially and \nincorporated into glacier ice, Longyearbreen, Svalbard. F: The very wet glacier foreland of \nSteinholtsj\u00f6kull, Iceland, showing proglacial lakes, sandur, and debris-covered medial moraine. \nG: Recently vacated ice-margin position, marked by a moraine of poorly-consolidated diamicton, \nSvinafellsj\u00f6kull, Iceland. \n \nFigure 9: Conceptual model of the formation of the stratigraphic sequence described in the text. \nA: Advance of Main Late Devensian ice overwhelms topography and preserves preexisting \nsediments only in topographic hollows. Intimate ice\u2013bed contact produces rock-flour that is \ndeposited as Facies C, grey subglacial till. B: Changes in the meltwater flux at the glacier bed \nduring deglaciation lead to greater ice\u2013bed separation and the deposition of the coarser-grained \nFacies D subglacial till. C: Younger Dryas glaciation reworks the upper substrate and adds new \nmaterial via melt-out from the glacier sole (Facies E) and the emplacement of subaerial debris \nflows (Facies F). Ice-marginal lakes form in the warming climate and allow gradual settling-out \nof fine-grained suspended sediment (Facies G).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
