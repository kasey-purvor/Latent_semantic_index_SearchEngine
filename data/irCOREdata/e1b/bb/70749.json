We also concluded that foreign language aptitude does not play a highly \nimportant role in communicative language teaching combined with focus-on-form instruction. \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nThe traditional construct of language aptitude has come under a lot of criticism. The \nmost important problems raised in connection with this cognitive determinant of language \nlearning outcomes include issues of construct validity, in other words problems related to the \nfact that language aptitude lacks an appropriate definition supported by theories of language \nlearning (D\u00f6rnyei, 2005; Sawyer & Ranta, 2001), as well as the relevance of the traditional \n 2 \ncomponents of language aptitude included in the Modern Language Aptitude Test (MLAT) \n(Carroll & Sapon, 1959) in 21st century language classrooms, where language learning means \nmore than just the acquisition of lexis and grammar (for a review see Robinson, 2005; Sawyer \n& Ranta, 2001; Skehan, 2002). Additional issues that emerged in connection with foreign \nlanguage aptitude involve the relation of language aptitude to intelligence and working \nmemory capacity, and the effect of language learning experience on aptitude (for a review of \nthese issues see Sawyer & Ranta, 2001). Despite the voices of criticism, language aptitude \ntests such as the MLAT are still widely used to screen students for admission and streaming in \nlanguage learning programs. \nParallel to the growing concerns about the appropriacy of the traditional language \naptitude test, new conceptualizations of language learning aptitude have been proposed, for \ninstance Grigorenko, Sternberg and Ehrman\u2019s (2000) CANAL-FT, which regards language \naptitude as the ability to cope with novel experience in language learning, and Robinson\u2019s \n(2001) aptitude complexes, which form a hierarchy of cognitive abilities relevant for second \nlanguage acquisition (SLA). \nThe aim of our research was to test some of the problematic aspects of the traditional \nconcepts of language aptitude and some of the new proposals concerning the definition of \nlanguage aptitude. We concentrate on three issues: the effect of language learning experience \non language aptitude test performance, the predictive power of language aptitude in a one-\nyear long intensive language training program, which primarily uses a communicative \napproach with focus-on-form instruction, and the relationship of working memory capacity \nand language aptitude. Our research uses a quasi-experimental design in assessing the effect \nof language learning experience on language aptitude as measured by the Hungarian version \nof MLAT (HUNLAT), and we applied a range of proficiency measures, which test more than \njust the acquisition of grammatical rules. The participants of our study were 15-16 year old \n 3 \nstudents of an English-Hungarian bilingual secondary school enrolled in a year of intensive \nforeign language training program, and a group of students with similar demographic \ncharacteristics from a regular secondary school, where languages are taught in four 45-minute \nlessons per week. We assessed phonological short-term memory capacity and language \naptitude both at the beginning and the end of the academic year. Students\u2019 verbal working \nmemory capacity was measured on one occasion only at the end of the school-year. The \nlanguage proficiency of the bilingual group was tested with a Cambridge First Certificate \nExam at the end of the academic year. Our study used a correlational design to investigate the \nrelationship of language aptitude, working memory and phonological short-term memory \ncapacity and language learning success, whereas in order to test the effect of language \nlearning experience on the performance on language aptitude and phonological short-term \nmemory measures a quasi-experimental arrangement was used, with the bilingual group being \nthe experimental and the students from the regular secondary school the control group.  \nIn what follows, we will outline previous research in the field of language aptitude and \nworking memory, describe the research methods we used and the results obtained.  We will \nconclude with a discussion and interpretation of the findings. \n \n \n2. Review of literature \n \nLanguage aptitude is traditionally conceptualized as a stable ability that is not \nsusceptible to training and is independent of previous language learning experience (Skehan, \n1998). Carroll and Sapon (as most developers of language aptitude tests before and after \nthem) followed the empirically-based psychometric approach to test development. Between \n1953 and 1958 they administered a great variety of tests that seemed likely to predict \n 4 \nlanguage learning success to about 5000 students. Based on the results, they selected the tasks \nwhich differentiated best between successful and unsuccessful language learners but did not \ncorrelate highly with each other (Carroll & Sapon, 1959). Such a pragmatic, assessment-\nbased, and atheoretical approach is not without precedent in the research of cognitive abilities, \nin fact this is the approach most commonly adopted in the development of intelligence tests. \nInstruments devised in this manner may have appropriate psychometric qualities (by \ndefinition, in fact, since their development was based on measures of validity and reliability). \nMoreover, such instruments may be used to define the construct in question, by using \ncomplex statistical analyses to extract underlying factors. This was the approach followed by \nCarroll as well in defining components of language aptitude (see below). However, from a \ntheoretical point of view, this process may be criticized for producing a construct which is, in \nfact, nothing more or less than what the test measures. This is a common critique of tests of \nintelligence, and according to D\u00f6rnyei (2005: 35) \u201cthe tacit understanding in the L2 research \ncommunity has been that language aptitude is what language aptitude tests measure\u201d. \nCarroll defined language aptitude as \u201csome characteristic of an individual which \ncontrols, at a given point of time the rate of progress that he will make subsequently in \nlearning a foreign language\u201d (1974, quoted by Sawyer and Ranta, 2001: 310). Based on the \nresults of factor analyses, Carroll (1981) identified four components of language aptitude: (1) \nPhonetic coding ability, which is \u201cthe ability to identify distinct sounds, to form association \nbetween those sounds and symbols representing them, and to retain these associations\u201d (p. \n105), (2) grammatical sensitivity, meaning the ability \u201cto recognize the grammatical functions \nof words (or other linguistic entities) in sentence structures\u201d (p. 105), (3) rote learning ability, \nwhich was defined as \u201cthe ability to learn associations between sounds and meanings rapidly \nand efficiently, and to retain these associations\u201d (p. 105), and (4) inductive language learning, \n 5 \nthat is, the ability \u201cto infer or induce the rules governing a set of language materials, given \nsample language materials that permit such inferences\u201d (p. 105). \nCorrelation coefficients between various language aptitude tests and tests of foreign \nlanguage proficiency range between 0.23 and 0.73 (Grigorenko et al., 2000). Ehrman and \nOxford (1995) found that among individual differences it is language aptitude that correlates \nmost closely with foreign language performance, explaining 25% of the variance. In a \nHungarian context similar to that of our study, Nikolov and Ott\u00f3 (2006) found that language \naptitude was the best predictor of the achievement on proficiency tests at the end of the \nacademic year in the case of beginner language learners (r=0.52 among students of English, \nr=0.39 among students of German). In the case of students who were not beginners when they \nstarted the preparatory language course, the best predictor proved to be language proficiency \nat the beginning of the training (r=0.78 and 0.74), and language aptitude was the second best \npredictor (r=0.44). \nOne of the basic assumptions behind the concept of language aptitude is that it is a \nrelatively stable characteristic, an endowment that is not modified by training or affected by \nprevious experience (Skehan, 1998). However, not all researchers agree with this view. \nMcLaughlin (1990:173) claims that \u201captitude should not be viewed as a static personality \ntrait; novices can become experts with experience.\u201d Grigorenko et al. (2000: 401) assert that \n\u201clanguage aptitude is a form of developing expertise rather than an entity fixed at birth.\u201d \nResearch evidence concerning the stability of language aptitude is ambiguous. In an early \nstudy Politzer and Weiss (1969, cited by Skehan, 1989) attempted to improve achievement on \nlanguage aptitude measures by training, but they could not provide convincing evidence that \nthis was possible. Sawyer (1992) did not observe correlations between previous language \nlearning experience and aptitude among students taking part in short intensive language \ncourses. Harley and Hart (1997) did not find higher levels of aptitude among early immersion \n 6 \nstudents having 12 years of exposure to a foreign language compared to late immersion \nstudents with only 4 years of exposure. Other studies, however, provide evidence for an effect \nof experience on language aptitude. A study conducted by Eisenstein (1980) showed that both \nbilinguals and students with previous training in foreign languages showed higher levels of \naptitude than students without previous language learning experience. She also found that \npolylinguals tended to outperform bilinguals and that bilinguals who received formal \neducation in a second language had an advantage over those who did not, although these \ndifferences were not statistically significant. In an experimental study Sparks, Ganshow, \nFluharty and Little (1995) reported that instruction in Latin resulted in an increase in language \naptitude scores in the case of both learning-disabled and non-learning-disabled high school \nstudents. \nIt can be seen from the above that previous research does not provide conclusive \nevidence either for or against stability in language aptitude. Despite the lack of evidence, the \nassumption of stability is rarely called into question. In the words of Skehan (2002: 79), \u201cthe \ntruth of this matter is that there is simply not enough evidence to argue for the stability of \naptitude with any certainty, but for now, following Carroll, we will assume that aptitude does \nnot change with the seasons!\u201d. \nRobinson (2001, 2005) raised several concerns with the traditional concept of language \naptitude, and he proposed that aptitude should be conceptualized as a complex and dynamic \nconstruct, comprising cognitive resources and primary abilities which combine into high-\norder abilities that are directly involved in various learning tasks. These abilities can in turn \nbe grouped into aptitude complexes. Aptitude complexes play different roles under different \nconditions of exposure to input (incidental, implicit and explicit learning). The significance of \nRobinson\u2019s research is that he investigates the aptitude-treatment interaction, conceiving of \nlanguage aptitude as a dynamic construct. \n 7 \nThe relevance of the Carollian concept of language aptitude in the communicative \nclassroom was first questioned by Krashen (1981). Since then the role of aptitude in various \nlanguage learning settings and under different learning conditions has been explored by a \nnumber of studies. Reves (1983, cited in Skehan, 2002), who investigated Arabic learners \nstudying English in a classroom setting and acquiring Hebrew in the target language \nenvironment, showed that aptitude plays a role in predicting success in both situations. \nSkehan (1989) also argued that aptitude might in fact be more important in naturalistic SLA \nthan in an instructional setting. Harley and Hart (1997) found that for young immersion \nlearners, aptitude had little power in predicting competence in L2, but for older ones, for \nwhom accuracy and academic language proficiency was a more focal point of instruction than \nfor younger students, aptitude correlated highly with most proficiency measures. Horwitz \n(1987) and Ehrman and Oxford (1995) investigating older age groups, which were primarily \ntaught with communicative methods, also found that certain sub-tests of language aptitude \nwere related to L2 performance. On the other hand, Ranta\u2019s (2002) research suggests that \nlanguage analytic abilities play a relatively insignificant role in communicative classrooms. \nLikewise, Robinson (1997, 2002a) found that language aptitude did not influence incidental \nrule-learning under the meaning focussed condition. \nA number of researchers have argued that working memory capacity might be a \ncognitive ability that is just as important in language learning as foreign language aptitude. \nSawyer and Ranta (2001: 340) pointed out that \u201cworking memory capacity may be the key to \nelaborating the concept of language aptitude itself and to clarifying its relationship with the \nsecond language acquisition (SLA) process.\u201d Miyake and Friedman (1998) proposed the \n\u201cworking memory as language aptitude\u201d hypothesis, claiming that working memory may be \nthe central component of language aptitude. To our knowledge, it is only Robinson (2002a), \nwho has tested the relation of working memory and foreign language aptitude. He found that \n 8 \nworking memory as measured with a reading span test had a moderately strong correlation \nwith language aptitude scores.  \nThe most widely accepted conceptualization of short-term memory today is the working \nmemory model developed by Baddeley and Hitch (1974; Baddeley, 1986). While previous \ntheories of memory systems focused on the storage function of memory, the new model, as its \nname suggests, adapts a more dynamic approach. This conceptualization of working memory \ncombines storage with the processing and manipulation of information, thus in this view \nworking memory plays a far greater role in cognitive activities such as comprehension, \nreasoning and learning than previously assumed (Baddeley, 2003). \nThe most widely researched component of working memory is the phonological loop. \nThis subsystem consists of a phonological store, which holds information for a few seconds, \nand an articulatory rehearsal process, which refreshes decaying information amongst other \nfunctions. The rehearsal process is analogous to subvocal speech and takes place in real-time, \nresulting in a limited span of immediate memory (after a certain number of items, the first one \nwill fade before it can be rehearsed). Phonological loop capacity is often measured by tasks \ninvolving immediate serial recall of numbers (digit span) or words (Baddeley, 2003). One of \nthe most widely used tests of phonological short-term memory capacity is the non-word \nrepetition test, where participants have to repeat non-words of various length. Non-words are \nwords that do not exist in the given language but conform to its phonotactic rules. \nParticipants\u2019 short-term memory capacity may then be expressed in terms of the non-word \nspan, which is the highest number of syllables the participant could repeat in at least 50% of \nthe cases. Other tests of phonological short-term memory include alphabet span (Craik, 1986) \nand forward digit span (Botwinick & Storandt, 1974).  \nReading and listening span (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980) as well as the backward digit \nspan task are considered complex verbal memory tasks. The backward digit span task is also \n 9 \npart of the Wechsler-IV intelligence test for children (Gathercole & Alloway, in press) and is \nhypothesized to be strongly related to general fluid intelligence (see Engle, Kane & Tuholsky, \n1999). The backward digit span and the reading and listening span tasks are frequently \nregarded as instruments testing more than just the phonological short-term memory: they are \nclaimed to assess the capacity of complex verbal working memory including the functioning \nof the central-executive, which is responsible for regulating attention (Gathercole, 1999; Hale \net al., 2002). We have to note, however, that there is also evidence, mainly from studies using \nfactor analysis, that tests measuring phonological short-term memory capacity and \ninstruments assessing complex verbal working memory capacity are in fact diagnostic tools \nthat tap the same underlying construct (for a recent study on this issue see Colom et al., 2006). \nComplex working memory has been found to influence mathematical abilities (Logie et al., \n1994, cited by Gathercole, 1999) as well as intellectual abilities such as following directions, \nnote-taking, writing and reasoning (Engle et al., 1999). In a recent paper Gathercole and \nAlloway (in press) argue that working memory \u201cacts a bottleneck for learning\u201d (p.12).  \nLanguage learning is in this respect very similar to the acquisition of literacy and \narithmetic skills and also requires that children maintain information in working memory \nwhile engaging in various cognitive activities. Phonological short-term memory was found to \nbe related to the ability to acquire new words in L2 (Cheung, 1996; Papagno & Vallar, 1995; \nService, 1992; Service & Kohonen, 1995; Speciale et al., 2004). Ellis and Sinclair (1996) \npresented experimental evidence that rehearsing foreign language material has beneficial \neffects on both comprehending and learning foreign language words, metalinguistic \nknowledge of grammar, accuracy in pronunciation and productive grammatical fluency and \naccuracy. O\u2019Brien et al. (2006) showed that there was a link between phonological memory \nand oral production skills and that the nature of relationship between measures of \n 10 \nphonological short-term memory and various assessments of oral performance was different \nbetween proficient and less-proficient L2 speakers. \nResearch on complex working memory and language skills is less abundant than studies \ninvestigating the role of phonological short-term memory. Most of these studies use the \nreading span task, the validity of which as a measure of verbal working memory capacity is \nquestionable (Waters & Caplan, 1996; Caplan & Waters, 1999). To our knowledge, no studies \nin the L2 field have used the backward digit span despite the fact that considerably fewer \nvalidity issues have been raised concerning this test than the reading span test (Hale et al., \n2002). Harrington and Sawyer (1992) found that L2 reading span scores showed high \ncorrelations with performance on the grammar (r=0.57, p<0.01) and the reading and \nvocabulary (r=0.54, p<0.01) sections of the TOEFL exam. Miyake and Friedman (1998) \nobtained evidence for the causal role of working memory in certain aspects of second \nlanguage proficiency (e.g. syntactic comprehension) using path analysis. \nIn our study we investigate three of the issues recently raised in connection with the \ntraditional concept of foreign language aptitude: the relationship of foreign language aptitude \nand working memory capacity, the role of foreign language aptitude in predicting success in \nthe framework of communicative language teaching combined with focus-on-form instruction \nand the stability of language aptitude in the course of language learning. As can be seen from \nthe review of literature, all of these issues have been investigated in previous research, but \nnever in the framework of a single study. Moreover, no studies examining the role of aptitude \nin communicative language teaching have used a comprehensive language testing instrument \nthat measures attainment in productive and receptive skills as well as linguistic competence. \nFinally our study is novel in applying a quasi-experimental design to test the effect of \nlanguage learning experience on language aptitude. We would like to point out here that in \n 11 \nour study the term language aptitude is used for the traditional Carollian concept of language \naptitude as measured by the HUNLAT. \nOur research questions were the following. \n1. What is the relationship between language aptitude and attained competence in the \nfour skills and linguistic knowledge at the end of an intensive course in English that \nused communicative methods of instruction combined with focus-on-form?  \n2. How are complex verbal working memory capacity, phonological short-term memory \nand language aptitude related?  \n3. Does language learning experience influence performance on the language aptitude \ntest?  \n4. Does language language learning experience have an effect on phonological short-\nterm memory capacity? \n \nOur hypotheses were the following: \nHypothesis 1. There will be a moderately strong correlation between the measures of \nlanguage aptitude and language proficiency.  \nHypothesis 2. There will be a moderately strong correlation between language aptitude \nscores and working memory test scores.  \nHypothesis 3. There will be a moderately strong correlation between language aptitude \nscores and phonological short-term memory test scores.  \nHypothesis 4. There will be a significant difference between the gain in language aptitude \ntest scores between students in the bilingual school and students of the regular school. \nHypothesis 5. There will be no significant difference between the gain in phonological \nshort-term memory scores between students in the bilingual school and students of the \nregular school. \n 12 \n \n \n3. Method \n \n3-1. Participants \n \nThe main research site was a Hungarian-English bilingual secondary school in \nBudapest. The participants were so-called zero-grade students, taking part in an intensive \nlanguage training programme from September 2005 to June 2006. The aim of this programme \nis that students achieve a level of proficiency in English which enables them to study several \nschool subjects in English in the following four years of secondary school. These students \nwould be ninth graders in a regular secondary school, and their age was between 15 and 16 \nyears.  \nOut of the 72 students enrolled in the zero-year programme, 59 students had either not \nlearned English in primary school, or the level of proficiency they reached was assessed as \nelementary in a placement test, and therefore they started from beginner level (corresponding \nto A1 in the Common European Framework of Reference (Council of Europe, 2001)). \nAccording to the foreign language program co-ordinator of the school, students\u2019 level of \nproficiency in the other group not included in the study was at the A2 level (Council of \nEurope, 2001). In order to have a comparable sample with the students forming the control \ngroup students at the A1 level were selected for the study. One student was excluded from the \nstudy because his mother tongue was not Hungarian. HUNLAT tests were completed by 54 \nstudents on both occasions. 43 students from the experimental group completed all the tests \non every occasion. Three participants were excluded from the analysis because of their \noutlying scores (the difference in their scores between the two testing sessions was larger than \n 13 \ntwo standard deviations). These outlying scores were indications of the possibility that \nstudents were either not paying enough attention or did not take the test seriously enough on \none of the occasions. Therefore altogether 40 students\u2019 data in the experimental group could \nbe analyzed in the present study. \nThe students studied English in five small groups, and they were taught by five teachers, \nincluding one native speaker teacher, who collaborated very closely. They had sixteen 45-\nminute English lessons per week (amounting to 576 hours of instruction by the end of the \nacademic year), and four additional English for special purposes lessons (mathematics, \nphysics, geography and history). The teaching method was predominantly communicative \ncombined with focus-on-form instruction.  \nIn order to distinguish the effects of intensive language learning from those of natural \nmaturation, a control group consisting of students in a regular secondary school was also \ntested. In this school, 33 ninth-grade students (from the same class) took part in the research. \n23 students completed all the tests. These students did not receive special instruction in \nforeign languages in their school, and they had four 45-minute lessons per week in a foreign \nlanguage. The teaching method used in the case of these students was also predominantly \ncommunicative combined with focus-on-form instruction.  \nTwo students were excluded from the analysis because of their outlying scores (the \ndifference in their scores between the two testing sessions was larger than two standard \ndeviations). In sum, 21 participants\u2019 data from the control group were submitted to analyses in \nthe present study. \n \n3-2. Instruments \n 14 \n Students in the bilingual school completed a language proficiency test, a backward \ndigit span task, the non-word test and the language aptitude test in September and June. The \ncontrol group took the aptitude test and the non-word test on two occasions. \nThe backward digit span task is widely recognized as a measure of complex working \nmemory capacity, involving both the central executive and the phonological loop (Gathercole, \n1999). The material for the test was adapted from the digit span test published by Racsm\u00e1ny \net al. (2005). In this task participants hear sequences of random digits (with a one-second \npause between the items) and have to repeat the numbers in reverse order. Sequences of 3 to 9 \ndigits were presented in sets of four in an increasing order. If a participant successfully \nrepeated two sequences from a set the other two were skipped. Backward digit span was \ncalculated as the highest number of digits a participant could successfully repeat in at least \n50% of the cases (at least two times out of four presentations).  \nThe Hungarian version of the non-word span test was developed by Racsm\u00e1ny et al \n(2005). It consists of 36 non-words which conform to the phonotactic rules of Hungarian. The \nnon-words are presented in a specific order, and participants have to repeat them one by one. \nEach non-word consists of one to nine syllables, and a set of four non-words corresponds to \neach number of syllables (the sets are not presented together). We recorded the test material \nwith a digital voice recorder and presented it using portable CD players. Each student was \ntested separately in a quiet room by the authors of the article. On the basis of the participants\u2019 \nperformance, their non-word span was calculated, which is the highest number of syllables \nthe participant can repeat in 50% of the cases (at least two times). \nThe Standard Hungarian Language Aptitude Test (HUNLAT, Ott\u00f3, 2002) consists of \nfour subtests described below.  \n1. Hidden Sounds  \n 15 \nThis test is a modified version of the \u2018Phonetic script\u2019 task of the MLAT and intends to \nmeasure phonetic coding ability. Participants listen to 54 consonant-vowel-consonant \nsequences and follow the transcription of these sequences in the test booklet. Afterwards they \nhear 20 similar sound sequences, and they have to indicate on the answer sheet which one of \nfour possible transcriptions corresponds to the given sound sequence. There is also a \u2018none\u2019 \noption. The subtest takes about 10 minutes. \n2. Language Analysis  \nThis subtest, which was adapted from the Pimsleur\u2019s (1966) Language Aptitude Battery \naims to measure inductive language learning ability. Participants are given a set of words and \nsentences in an artificial language along with their Hungarian translations. On the basis of this \ninformation, they have to translate 20 Hungarian sentences to the artificial language and \nchoose the correct solution from four alternatives. Participants have 15 minutes for this \nsubtest. \n3. Words in Sentences  \nParticipants have 10 minutes to solve 20 items, each consisting of two Hungarian \nsentences. One word is underlined in the first sentence. In the second sentence, five words are \nunderlined of which participants have to choose the one that fulfils the same function as the \nunderlined word in the first sentence. This task is based on a similar subtest of the MLAT and \nis assumed to measure grammatical sensitivity. \n4. Vocabulary Learning  \nThis subtest, which was adapted from the MLAT, measures rote learning ability. \nParticipants have 5 minutes to study a list of 24 Swahili words and their Hungarian \nequivalents. Then they have 10 minutes to choose the Hungarian equivalent of 20 Swahili \nwords from five alternatives. \n 16 \nThe students\u2019 end-term exam was a Cambridge First Certificate Exam, which was \nconducted by the teachers of the school. The written paper consisted of reading and listening \ncomprehension, composition, and a Use of English test. The reading and listening \ncomprehension sections contained three texts each, accompanied by multiple-choice items \nand questions requiring short answers. The Use of English test measured students\u2019 knowledge \nof vocabulary and grammatical constructions. In the composition task students had to write in \nthree different genres, which were evaluated on the basis of their content and accuracy. The \noral exam consisted of an interview, a picture description task and a problem-solving task in \npairs.  \n \n3-3. Procedures \n \nThe language aptitude test and the phonological short-term memory test were \nadministered at the beginning (in September 2005) and at the end of the academic year (in \nJune 2006) in both schools. The difference between the times of administration in the two \nschools was no more than two weeks on either occasion. In the bilingual school, the language \naptitude test was administered by the teachers of the school with the aid of the CD recording. \nIn the other school, the language aptitude test was administered by the first author.  \nStudents from both schools took the phonological short-term memory test, but the \nbackward digit span test was only performed by the students in the bilingual school. Students \nwere tested individually by both authors in a quiet room in June. The test material was \nrecorded and was presented using portable CD players. \nThe Cambridge First Certificate Exam was conducted by the teachers of the school. \nStudents\u2019 performance both in the writing and speaking component was assessed \nindependently by two teachers who did not teach the students during the school year. The \n 17 \nteachers participated in a rater-training session prior to the exam and final scores were agreed \non by both teachers. We received the results of the exam including the scores achieved in the \nsubtests from the teachers of the school.  \n \n4. Results \n \nThe students of the bilingual school excelled in their Cambridge First Certificate Exam \nat the end of their year of intensive English language learning. Only six of the 72 students \nfailed the exam (they achieved less than 66% of the total score). Appendix 1 contains the \nmeans and standard deviations as well as the minimum and maximum scores for each paper \nand the total of the exam. The mean of the total points achieved is 161.82 (SD=15.21), which \nis 72.85% of the total score. The students of both schools achieved high scores on the \nHUNLAT. In the bilingual school, the mean of the HUNLAT Total was 53.41 at Time 1, and \n60.82 at Time 2, whereas in the control group the mean values were 58.38 at Time 1 and \n60.67 at Time 2. These results are higher than those obtained in the previous Hungarian \nsurvey of students participating in a preparatory foreign language training year (Nikolov & \nOtt\u00f3, 2006). In a study by Ott\u00f3 and Nikolov (2003) first-year university students achieved \nsimilar results with a mean of 55.79 points (Appendix 2 and 3 summarize the descriptive \nstatistics for HUNLAT).  \nNon-word repetition scores were very similar both across groups and at the two different \ntesting occasions. The average number of syllables students could repeat in the experimental \ngroup at Time was 7.49 (SD = .64) and at  Time 2 7.31 (SD = .73). The non-word span of \nstudents in the control group at Time was 7.67 (SD = .65) and at  Time 2 7.57 (SD = .87). \nBackward digit span was only measured in the bilingual school in June 2006. The mean was \n5.38 (SD=1.12), which indicates that participants were able to repeat about 5 numbers in \n 18 \nreverse order. The non-word span scores of our participants are higher than the national \naverage of this age group as found by Racsm\u00e1ny and his colleagues (2005), whose \nparticipants aged between 12 and 16 scored 5.17 syllables. There is no Hungarian normative \ndata available concerning the backward digit span task. Although the mean values for these \ntests indicate that the participants have very good cognitive abilities, the standard deviation \nfigures and the distribution of the scores showed enough variation to be able to carry out \ncorrelational analyses. \nIn order to answer the first research question, we examined the correlations between \nlanguage proficiency measures and language aptitude scores achieved at the beginning of the \nintensive language teaching program (Time 1) and at the end of the school-year (Time 2). The \nresults are presented in Table 1.  \n The figures in Table 1 indicate that correlations between the total score on the \nlanguage aptitude test at Time 1 and 2  and the language proficiency exam results are \nsignificant, but relatively low. The common variance of these two variables is approximately \n10%. The results also reveal that the correlations are somewhat different at Time 1 and Time \n2, although the strength of relationship between the total HUNLAT and proficiency score \nremains the same on both occasions. At Time 1 it is speaking test scores and the total \nproficiency test score that are related to the total number of points achieved on the language \naptitude test, whereas at  Time 2, it is reading, Use of English and the total test score that \nshows correlations with the total HUNLAT score. Among the sub-components of aptitude at \nTime 2, it is only Language analysis and Vocabulary learning scores that correlate with \nresults on the reading test.  At Time 1, we find considerably more significant correlations \namong the sub-components of HUNLAT and the various proficiency test components, the \ntwo strongest ones being the relationship between Language analysis and writing and Words \nin sentences and speaking.   \n 19 \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nIn an attempt to answer our second research question, we correlated measures of \nworking memory (backward digit span) and language aptitude at Time 1 and Time 2 (see \nTable 2) in the case of students studying in the intensive language teaching program \n(experimental group). Backward digit-span was moderately correlated with the total \nHUNLAT score both at Time 1 and Time 2. The Language analysis sub-test of HUNLAT at \nTime 1 was related to performance on the working memory test. We also examined the \nrelationship of phonological short-term (non-word span) and language aptitude both at Time 1 \nand Time 2 in the case of the experimental group (the analysis was not carried out separately \nfor the control group because the number of students in this group was not sufficient for \ncorrelational analysis). As can be seen in Table 3, non-word repetition scores showed no \ncorrelation with language aptitude results on any of the occasions for the experimental group. \nWe obtained no significant results either when all the participants\u2019 non-word scores were \ncorrelated with HUNLAT scores. In order to investigate the differential effect of working \nmemory and language aptitude in language learning success, we carried out regression \nanalyses. We found that if these two variables are simultaneously entered into the equation, \nbackward digit span is the sole predictor (R square = .21; \u03b2 = .46, p = .003) and the HUNLAT \nscore is not a significant predictor variable (\u03b2 = .22, p = .14). \n \nINSERT TABLES 2 AND 3 ABOUT HERE \n \n In order to investigate the effect of language learning experience on performance in \nthe language aptitude test, we compared the gains of the experimental group, which was the \n 20 \ngroup of learners receiving intensive foreign language instruction, and that of the control \ngroup comprising learners from the regular secondary school by means of independent \nsamples t-test. As can be seen in Table 4, the experimental group improved significantly more \nduring the one-year of intensive language learning program in terms of general language \naptitude than the control group. We can also see a significant difference between the two \ngroups in the gain in the Hidden sounds and Words in sentences component of the test. \nCohen\u2019s d indicates a large effect for the total HUNLAT gain and improvement in the Hidden \nsounds test and a moderate effect for the Words in sentences sub-test. We also have to note \nthat students from both schools scored significantly higher on HUNLAT in June than in \nSeptember (experimental group t (df 39) = 7.64, p < .001; control group (df  (19) = 2.01, p < \n.05). As shown in Table 4, there was no difference in the gains on the non-word repetition test \nbetween the groups, and the performance of the groups did not improve between Time 1 and \nTime 2 either (experimental group t (df 39) = 1.36, p = .18; control group (df  (19) = .56, p = \n.57). \n \nINSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE \n \n5. Discussion \n \nOur first research question concerned the role of the traditional concept of language \naptitude in predicting language proficiency attained in an intensive language learning program \nthat uses communicative methods combined with focus on form instruction. In Hypothesis 1 \nwe assumed that there would be a moderately strong correlation between language aptitude as \nmeasured by HUNLAT and achievement. Our hypothesis, however, was only partially \nsupported, as we found a relatively weak relationship between overall proficiency scores and \n 21 \nthe total score on HUNLAT. The correlation between the total proficiency and aptitude score \nis lower than the level of correlations found in the studies of Ehrman and Oxford (1995), and \nHarley and Hart (1997). This indicates that indeed D\u00f6rnyei (2005) and Robinson (2005) \nrightly raised the criticism concerning the traditional construct of language aptitude that it \ndoes not adequately describe the abilities students need to draw on when studying in \ncommunicative classrooms. Total language aptitude scores when measured at the onset of \nlanguage learning were found to be correlated with speaking test scores, and at Time 2 with \nreading and Use of English scores. If we observe the relationships between the different \nsubtests of the aptitude and proficiency measures, we find that the Language Analysis subtest \nof the HUNLAT correlates with the writing component and listening component of the \nproficiency test. This subtest measures inductive language learning ability, which seems to \nplay an important role in discovering grammatical regularities in the input (see also Harley & \nHart, 1997). It can be assumed that it is through the correlation with grammatical accuracy as \na component of writing assessment that Language Analysis at Time 1 comes to play a \nrelatively strong role in overall writing scores. We can also hypothesize that this is the case \nconcerning the relationship of the Words in sentences and performance in the speaking test, \nwhere accuracy was also one of the components assessed. Our results indicate that if language \naptitude is assessed at the onset of language learning, only the two tests of metalinguistic \nabilities (Language analysis and Words in sentences) seem to be important in influencing \nattainment in various skills. It can be seen very clearly from our results that if language \naptitude as measured by HUNLAT had any relevance for our participants in the foreign \nlanguage classroom, its role is mainly confined to predicting achievement in the attainment of \ngrammar and vocabulary knowledge and the ability to use this knowledge in on-line \nperformance. \n 22 \nThe results also reveal that there is little difference between the correlation between \nthe total scores of the proficiency test and that of HUNLAT when measured at the onset of the \nlanguage learning program and when assessed simultaneously with language proficiency. If, \nhowever, the sub-components of HUNLAT are correlated with the various competencies \nmeasured by the proficiency exam at Time 1 and Time 2, different patterns of correlations \nemerge. This indicates that aptitude tests should ideally be administered before students start \nlanguage learning and not be tested parallel with language proficiency as done in a number of \nprevious research projects (e.g. Kiss & Nikolov, 2005). \n The second question we investigated was the relationship of working memory and \nlanguage aptitude, which question was directed at finding support for Miyake and Friedman\u2019s \n(1998) working memory as language aptitude hypothesis. Hypothesis 2 was supported as we \nfound a moderate relationship between backward digit span scores and the total HUNLAT \nscore both at Time 1 and Time 2. The HUNLAT and backward digit test results share \napproximately 13% of the variance, which indicates that these two constructs are related but \nare not interchangeable. The level of correlation found between the backward digit span and \nlanguage aptitude total score closely approximates Robinson\u2019s (2002a) results despite the fact \nthat he used a reading span task to assess working memory capacity. The pattern of \ncorrelations also reveals that the only significant relationship between working memory and \ncomponents of aptitude is with the Language Analysis sub-test. This indicates that the ability \nto maintain and manipulate verbal information in working memory influences the efficiency \nwith which students can deduce linguistic rules from the input in a language unknown to the \nstudents as measured by the Language Analysis sub-test of HUNLAT. This task is actually an \nexplicit learning task with a rule-search condition, for which Robinson (2002a) only found an \neffect of working memory in the listening version o\n 23 \nOur results also indicate that Miyake and Friedman rightly attribute a highly important \nrole to working memory capacity in language learning as the regression analysis we carried \nout reveals that that there is a strong relationship between attainment in an intensive language \ncourse and working memory test scores (see also Kormos & S\u00e1f\u00e1r, in press), and that working \nmemory is a better predictor of language learning success than the traditional construct of \nlanguage aptitude. Our results tend to lend support to Robinson\u2019s conceptualization of \nlanguage aptitude complexes, since they reveal that some components of language aptitude as \nmeasured by HUNLAT are related to working memory capacity, but they do not overlap. Our \nprevious research (Kormos & S\u00e1f\u00e1r, in press) as well as the present study suggests that \nvarious aptitude components play a different role not only in different tasks but in the \nattainment of different skills such as speaking, listening reading and writing. Our findings \nalso show that although phonological short-term memory capacity is generally known to play \nan important role in first language acquisition (Gathercole & Alloway, in press), it is a \ncognitive variable that is not related to foreign language aptitude. As our previous study with \na similar population indicates, in the case of learners progressing from the beginner to the \nintermediate level, phonological short-term memory capacity has little effect on attainment in \nL2 (Kormos & S\u00e1f\u00e1r, in press). \nOur third question addressed the issue of the stability of language aptitude over time. \nThe results show that the performance of the participants on the HUNLAT both in the control \nand the treatment group was different at the two testing occasions. When comparing the \ndifferences between Time1 and Time2, we found that the change between the two occasions \nwas significantly higher in the bilingual school in the case of the Hidden Sounds and the total \nHUNLAT score, which supports our fourth hypothesis. The results indicate a strong practice \neffect for both groups and an effect of intensive language instruction on the performance on \nthe HUNLAT.  \n 24 \nResearch in the field of dyslexia reveals that phonological sensitivity, which is the \nability measured by the Hidden sounds test, can be improved with the help of compensatory \nteaching (Nijakowska, in press). It seems that intensive language learning without \nconsiderable explicit training in phonological sensitivity can also contribute to the \nenhancement in non-learning disabled students\u2019 ability to recognize and memorize different \nsounds. \nThe t-test comparing the gains of the two groups indicated that students in the intensive \nlanguage teaching program also improved in the Words in Sentences component of \nHUNLAT. If we examine this task, it becomes apparent that in this task students have to draw \non their literacy skills. The recognition of the role different words play in sentences is \nexplicitly taught in elementary schools; therefore this component of HUNLAT (and MLAT) \ndoes not measure an underlying cognitive ability but rather a literacy skill. Since in instructed \nSLA, it is highly important to understand the grammatical function of lexical items, it is \nunderstandable that the ability to identify grammatical functions develops in intensive \nlanguage learning.  \nIn sum, our results show that language learning exerts important influence on certain \ntraditional components of language aptitude, which indicates that some of the constructs \nHUNLAT is purported to measure are not abilities but skills that can be trained. Although we \nwere not able to measure improvement in the backward digit span test, our results concerning \nthe stability of performance on the non-word repetition test indicate that phonological short-\nterm memory capacity is not influenced by language learning experience (Hypothesis 5).  \n \n6. Conclusions  \n \n 25 \nOur research investigated three issues recently raised in connection with the traditional \nconceptualization of foreign language aptitude: the role of aptitude in communicative \nlanguage classrooms, the stability of language aptitude in the course of language learning and \nthe relationship of working memory capacity and language learning outcomes. Our results \nreveal that as hypothesized by theoretical papers in this field (e.g. D\u00f6rnyei, 2005; Robinson, \n2005; Sawyer & Ranta, 2001), the Carrollian concept of language aptitude needs to be revised \nconsiderably. In this study we found that if students are instructed with primarily \ncommunicative methods combined with focus on form, language aptitude as measured by \nHUNLAT has moderate power in predicting success in language learning. Its role is mainly \nconfined to influencing the acquisition of grammar and vocabulary, and it has small predictive \npower on complex skills such as reading, listening, speaking and writing. The range of \nsignificant correlations between working memory capacity and language proficiency we \nobtained in a previous study (Kormos & S\u00e1f\u00e1r, in press) and the results of regression analysis \nreveal that working memory capacity is indeed a key underlying cognitive variable affecting \nboth language aptitude and language learning success. The correlations between language \naptitude and working memory and the different components of language proficiency also \nshow that students need to draw on different abilities when acquiring various foreign \nlanguage skills, which further extends Robinson\u2019s (2002b) ability differentiation hypothesis \nfrom tasks to linguistic sub-skills such as reading, writing, listening and speaking. Our results \nalso support the hierarchical nature of cognitive abilities (Robinson, 2002b) as it seems that \nworking memory and deductive skills are abilities of primary importance and other traditional \ncomponents of aptitude play a secondary role. \n The other main lesson that can be learnt from our study is that language aptitude as \nconceptualized by Carroll and Sapon (1959) is not an ability unaffected by experience. A \nmajor effect of intensive language learning could be detected on performance in the sub-test \n 26 \nof HUNLAT measuring phonological sensitivity, which also resulted in a significant increase \nin the overall language aptitude test score. The results indicate that this aptitude component is \na skill rather than an underlying ability. This skill develops spontaneously during language \nlearning, but as the results of studies with dyslexic language learners reveal (Nijakowska, in \npress), it can also be improved through systematic training. \nOne of the limitations of our study is the use of correlational design in investigating the \nrelationship between attainment in L2 and language aptitude. Finding significant correlations \nis no proof for the direction of causality, nor does it reveal  its very existence. As the results \nof our study show, it might well happen that high-proficiency students have more language \nlearning experience and thus higher aptitude and do not necessarily perform well in an L2 \nsimply because they score high on the aptitude test. The other limitation of this study \nconcerns its generalizability. Participants had  generally good cognitive abilities, and they \nparticipated in a highly intensive language training programme. These circumstances \nnecessarily warrant future research with students who have lower levels of cognitive abilities. \nFurther studies would also be needed to uncover the role of working memory capacity in \nperforming various language learning tasks and in being able to benefit from the linguistic \ninput and the output demands of these tasks. \n \n \n \nAffiliation of the authors: \n*E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Department of English Applied Linguistics \n+ Lancaster University, Bowland College, Department of Linguistics and English Language \n \nE-mail address: *annasafar@gmail.com, +kormos.j@chello.hu \n \n 27 \n \n \n \n \nAppendix 1.
