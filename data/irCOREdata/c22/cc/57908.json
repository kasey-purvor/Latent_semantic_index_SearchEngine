Locally, these co-occur with isolated, two-dimensional, discoidal or ovato-\ntriangular fossils. In the 1870s, Nicholson interpreted these isolated fossils as being \ngraptoloid \u2018egg-sacs\u2019, detached from their parent and existing as free-swimming \nbodies.

Though reproductive organs are occasionally found, they usually require \nexceptional preservation for their true nature to be discerned (e.g. Siveter et al. 2003; \nDunlop et al. 2004). Whilst a certain amount is known of the reproductive strategies \nand mechanisms of the pterobranch hemichordates (Gilchrist 1915; Stebbing 1970; \nDilly 1973; Hutt 1991), the extant sister group of the graptolites (Koz\u0142owski 1947, \n1948; Towe & Urbanek 1972; Crowther 1978; Cameron 2005), little is known about \nreproduction in the graptolites themselves (e.g. Urbanek & Jaanusson 1974). \nLikewise, as little is known of the buoyancy mechanism employed by the graptoloids \n(Bates 1987), any putatively vesicular graptoloid tissues (e.g. Fig. 1d, f) tend to attract \ninterest and debate (e.g. Underwood 1993; Rickards et al. 1994). \nThere are many gaps in our knowledge of the earliest developmental stages of \nthe graptolites, especially surrounding the events prior to the dispersal of their \nprosiculae (cone-shaped larvae). Working on well-preserved material from the \nTremadoc of Poland, Koz\u0142owski (1948) showed clutches of eggs and embryos in the \nautothecae of benthonic graptolites; similar structures have also been found in \nReticulograptus tuberosus, a bushy tuboid graptolite from G\u00f6tland, Sweden (Bulman \n& Rickards 1966). Unlike the graptoloids, benthonic graptolites have two types of \nthecae. These differentiated thecae have been interpreted as sexual dimorphs, with the \nsmaller bithecae housing the male zooid and the larger autothecae housing the female \n(Koz\u0142owski 1948), though this has yet to be confirmed. Nevertheless, the loss of \nbithecae in the graptoloids may indicate that their reproductive strategy altered as they \ncolonised the plankton (Hutt 1991), and neither eggs nor embryos have been found in \ngraptoloid thecae. Some workers have suggested that the graptolite synrhabdosome \nmay represent short-lived congregations of several colonies in sexual congress (e.g. \n 4\nZalasiewicz 1984) or asexually developing supercolonies (Ruedemann 1947; Bulman \n1970). However, the nature of synrhabdosomes remains enigmatic (cf. Rigby 1993; \nUnderwood 1993; Guti\u00e9rrez-Marco & Lenz 1998). \nIn order to assess whether putatively vesicular graptoloid tissues played a role \nin reproduction, we have undertaken a thorough re-evaluation of sac-like graptolite \nappendages (Fig. 1d, f ) and also of \u201cDawsonia\u201d Nicholson 1873 (Figs 1, 2 & 3), \nwhich was originally interpreted as being an ovarian vesicle of a graptoloid detached \nfrom its parent colony. Though this genus has a long history of research, it has \n\u201ccaused confusion ever since it was first described\u201d (Williams, 1981). We initially \nestablish the context in which the fossils were originally interpreted and how they \nhave been subsequently reinterpreted, prior to re-evaluating them based on the \noriginal material and on new specimens. \n \n1. History of research \n \nPrior to Koz\u0142owski\u2019s seminal monograph of 1948, the zoological affinities of the \ngraptolites attracted much debate. They were initially thought to be a moss (Von \nBromell 1727), to be artefacts (Linnaeus 1768), or even, as Nimmo (1847) suggested, \nthe tail spines of the Indian Ocean ray Raja pastinaca, though Nimmo had probably \nnever seen a graptolite (Elles & Wood 1901-1918, p. xiii).  Eventually, graptolites \nwere recognised as colonies consisting of a series of cup-shaped orifices (thecae) and \nthey were variously assigned to the Cnidaria and Bryozoa (see summaries in Elles & \nWood 1901-1918; Koz\u0142owski 1948; Crowther 1978). As the reproductive strategies \nemployed in these groups differ considerably, no small part of the discussion of their \n 5\nsystematic position focussed on the interpretation of rare, attached, putatively sac-like \nappendages (e.g. Nicholson 1872; Ulrich & Ruedemann 1931). \n \n1.1 1850-1870: sac-like appendages and \u2018graptogonophores\u2019  \nGraptolites bearing sac-like appendages have been known since the 1850s, but due to \n\u201cvarious [unspecified] accidental difficulties\u201d (Logan in Hall 1865 and references \ntherein) illustrations were not published until the next decade. Hall (1865) proposed \nthat these appendages were reproductive bodies similar to hydrozoan gonothecae, and \nsuggested that graptolites were closely related to the sertularians. It seems Hall\u2019s work \ncaptured the imagination of the young H. Alleyne Nicholson: Hall\u2019s monograph was \nlikely used by Nicholson to aid the identification of the graptolites he collected in the \nSouthern Uplands. Indeed, Nicholson (1866, 1872, 1873) regularly referred to Hall\u2019s \nwork on graptolite reproduction. \nWhilst collecting the Silurian strata of the Southern Uplands in the summer of \n1866, Nicholson discovered a variety of discoidal and ovato-triangular fossils \nassociated with graptolites (e.g. Fig 2). Though not found attached to graptolites \nthemselves, these fossils resemble the supposed reproductive organs described by \nHall (1865), and Nicholson (1866) argued that they represented graptolite ovarian \nvesicles which had detached from their parent colony, and called them \n\u2018graptogonophores\u2019. He supported Hall\u2019s argument for a hydroid affinity for the \ngraptolites, suggesting that the concentrically \u2018ribbed\u2019 discoidal specimens \nrepresented vertical compressions of a sertularian-like graptogonophore, and that the \novato-triangular specimens were preserved in profile. Nicholson supported his \ninterpretation by illustrating several examples where the discoidal and ovato-\ntriangular specimens were closely associated with graptoloids (e.g. Fig 1c).  \n 6\nHowever, this work was controversial, drawing a vociferous reply from \nWilliam Carruthers who argued that the associations of the supposed \ngraptogonophores with graptolites were no more than fortuitous juxtapositions, and \nthat the discoidal specimens most likely represented the brachiopod Siphonotreta \nmicula (Carruthers 1867a). This precipitated a lengthy correspondence, with \nNicholson (1867a, 1867b, 1867c, 1868b) arguing that graptolites were hydrozoans, \nlargely on the basis of their reproductive strategy, whilst the more vehement \nCarruthers (1867b, 1867c, 1868a, 1868b) stated that considerations of zoological \nposition should be based on \u2018normal\u2019 characters such as colony construction rather \nthan on rare and ambiguous evidence. The latter felt that whilst graptolites were \nclosely allied to the Hydrozoa, they also shared characters with the Polyzoa. As much \nby perseverance as by any tendency to provide new information, Nicholson\u2019s view \nthat graptolites were extinct hydrozoans became more widely accepted. Nicholson\u2019s \nwork subsequently focussed more on corals than graptolites (see Benton 1979); and, \nat this time, graptolite research itself also moved away from more theoretical \ndiscussions of their affinity with workers such as Lapworth focussing on the more \npractical concerns of taxonomy and biostratigraphy (e.g. Elles & Wood 1901-1918; \nOldroyd 1990; Rushton 2001). \n \n1.2 1870-1900: Graptolite reproduction and \u201cDawsonia\u201d Nicholson  \nNicholson\u2019s theory of graptolite reproduction supposed that once sufficiently mature, \nthe \u2018graptogonophore\u2019 detached itself from its connection with the parent colony and \nbecame a free-swimming zooid (Nicholson 1868a). This assertion was supported in \npart by evidence for the co-occurrence of \u2018graptogonophores\u2019 and graptolites \nfurnished with ramifying fibres (e.g. Fig. 1f) in the same strata (Nicholson 1872).  \n 7\nNicholson (1873) noted that there were several distinct types of \ngraptogonophore in the Ordovician L\u00e9vis Fm. at Point L\u00e9vis, Quebec. As it would be \nalmost impossible to relate these back to the individual graptolite species they came \nfrom, he referred them to the form genus \u201cDawsonia\u201d, much in the manner that one \nnames ichnotaxa independently of the animal that constructed them. Nicholson (1873) \nnamed four species: \u201cD.\u201d acuminata, \u201cD.\u201d rotunda, \u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata, and \u201cD.\u201d \ncampanulata. Gurley (1896), also working in Point L\u00e9vis, added two further species: \n\u201cD.\u201d monodon and \u201cD.\u201d tridens. \nThese species have disparate temporal and geographical ranges. \u201cD.\u201d \ncampanulata is only known from Early Silurian strata of the British Isles (Nicholson \n1873; Lapworth 1876, 1876-7; Marr & Nicholson 1888; Peach & Horne 1899; \nWilliams 1981, 1996), though it occurs in both Laurentia (in Moffatdale, Scotland, \nand Coalpit Bay, Donaghadee, Northern Ireland) and Avalonia (the English Lake \nDistrict), which were on either sides of the Early Palaeozoic Iapetus Ocean at this \ntime. \u201cD.\u201d rotunda and \u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata are only found in the Ordovician Quebec \nGroup at Point L\u00e9vis, Canada (Nicholson 1873), and Gurley\u2019s species have only been \nrecorded in the Ordovician of North America at Point L\u00e9vis, Quebec, and the Deep \nKill, near Melrose, New York (Ruedemann 1904, 1934; Vannier et al. 2003). \nHowever, \u201cD.\u201d acuminata appears to be more cosmopolitan, with Nicholson (1873) \nstating that it occurs at both Point L\u00e9vis, Canada, and in northern England. Nicholson \n(1873) noted that his concept of \u201cD.\u201d acuminata was similar to \u201cD.\u201d campanulata in \nboth stratigraphic range and form, though he acknowledged that its outline was \nnotably more triangular and its mucro (proximal termination) less sharply delineated. \nNicholson (1873) believed that his localities in the UK and Canada were \ncontemporaneous and of similar age to graptolites bearing sac-like appendages (Hall \n 8\n1865, Nicholson 1872), though graptolite biostratigraphy now reveals this to be \nuntrue (cf. section 6 & refs in Fig 5a). However, in the 1870s the age of the strata in \nthe Southern Uplands sections was somewhat of an enigma (Oldroyd 1990; Rushton \n2001), making correlation with North American sections problematic. \n \n1.3 Twentieth century work on graptolite reproduction \nThe 20th century saw graptolite reproduction become a less prevalent area of research, \nand since a pterobranch affinity for graptolites has been clearly demonstrated \n(Koz\u0142owski 1947, 1948; Towe & Urbanek 1972; Crowther 1978), Nicholson\u2019s work \nhas become largely overlooked. However, biserial graptoloids with sac-like \nappendages unquestionably attached to their rhabdosome continued to be described as \nreproductive structures in the early twentieth century (e.g. Elles 1940). Likewise, \nUlrich and Ruedemann (1931) reported dendroid graptolites with swollen, oval \nappendages purportedly homologous with bryozoan ooecia. However, these \ncorrespond to bithecae in terms of position and arrangement, and the specimens are \ntoo poorly preserved to discern their precise nature (Koz\u0142owski 1948).  \nThe discovery of eggs and embryos inside the autothecae of benthic \ngraptolites (Koz\u0142owski 1948; Bulman & Rickards 1966) led to a reinterpretation of \nsac-like appendages in graptolites. Koz\u0142owski (1948) considered Hall\u2019s supposed \u2018egg \nsacs\u2019 to be chitinous envelopes associated with the zooids, though he did not speculate \non their function, whilst Bulman (1964) figured several similar specimens in an early \ndiscussion of graptolite hydrodynamics. Similarly, more recent discussions of \ngraptolite reproduction have overlooked these and other supposed reproductive organs \n(e.g. Crowther 1978; Hutt 1991; Underwood 1993). For example, the branching \nappendages described in Ruedemann (1936) were thought to represent epibionts \n 9\n(Koz\u0142owski 1948). The swollen, oval appendages documented by Ulrich and \nRuedemann (1931) might also be epibionts: Koz\u0142owski (1965) showed that \nCephalocystis graptolithifilius, a similar structure found on other graptolites, is in fact \na cephalopod egg capsule comparable to those of the recent Sepia officinalis which \nencrusts the sea grass Zostera. Similarly, Underwood (1993) suggested that the \nputative cases of connection between graptogonophores and graptolites, as illustrated \nby Nicholson (1866), could plausibly represent parasitic outgrowths or epizoans \ncolonising a graptolite \u2018benthic island\u2019 sensu Kaufmann (1978).   \nHowever, these and other examples of sac-like graptoloid appendages (e.g. Fig \n1d, f) are certainly distinct from the unambiguous parasites figured by Bates and \nLoydell (2000), but are superficially similar in form and preservation to \u201cD.\u201d \ncampanulata and \u201cD.\u201d acuminata. As such they require re-examination. Since \nKoz\u0142owski\u2019s influential work \u2018graptogonophores\u2019 have generally been described as \nsac-like or vane-like appendages with little comment as to their function (e.g. Bulman \n1964; Koren\u2019 & Rickards 1997). \n \n1.4 A pterobranch-like model for graptolite reproduction? \nSince scanning electron microscopy has been employed for studies of graptolite \nultrastructure (e.g. Towe & Urbanek 1970; Crowther 1978, 1981), an affinity for \ngraptolites with the pterobranch hemichordates has become widely accepted (e.g. \nDilly 1993; Cameron 2005; Maletz et al. 2005). As such, recent discussions of \nreproduction in graptolites (e.g. Hutt 1991) have been premised on the belief that \ngraptolites adopt pterobranch-like mechanisms (cf. Gilchrist 1915; Stebbing 1970). \nThe pterobranchs Rhabdopleura and Cephalodiscus reproduce both sexually and \nasexually (Hutt 1991). Though most zooids in R. compacta are neuter or sexually \n 10\nimmature, certain zooids may metamorphose and develop either an ovum or testis \n(Stebbing 1970). Whilst the sexes are separate in Rhabdopleura, certain species of \nCephalodiscus colonies may be hermaphroditic, with certain zooids bearing both male \nand female reproductive organs (Horst 1939, Bulman 1970). Though its colonies are \nsessile and its zooids have limited movement, Rhabdopleura undergoes internal \nfertilisation, with its oviduct serving only as a conduit for sperm to reach the ova \n(Stebbing 1970). In both Rhabdopeura and Cephalodiscus, clutches of embryos \nremain in the creeping tube until they mature as ciliated, lecithotrophic larvae (Dilly \n1973; Lester 1988a). The larva leaves the creeping tube as a free-swimming \nindividual which secretes a collagenous, dome-shaped prosiculum (Dilly 1973; Dilly \n& Ryland 1985). Later, the larva metamorphoses under the prosiculum and emerges \nas a juvenile (Dilly & Ryland 1985; Lester 1988b) that settles on the substrate and \nlater asexually buds to form a colony (Stebbing 1970; Dilly 1973).  \nThough there is little direct evidence of reproduction in the graptolite fossil \nrecord (cf. Hutt 1991), eggs and embryos have been reported in certain specimens \n(Koz\u0142owski 1948; Bulman & Rickards 1966). This would be consistent with \ngraptolites producing a free-swimming lecithotrophic larva, that later secretes a \nprosicula (equivalent to the pterobranch prosiculum) in the plankton before maturing \n(cf. Williams & Clarke 1999) and budding to form a colony. \n \n1.5 Historical interpretations of \u201cDawsonia\u201d Nicholson \n1.5.1 \u201cD.\u201d monodon, \u201cD.\u201d tridens, \u201cD.\u201d acuminata, and \u201cD.\u201d campanulata: \ncrustaceans, molluscs or algae? These mucronate species have received more \nattention than the other species, which are dealt with below. \u201cD.\u201d monodon and \u201cD.\u201d \ntridens were originally described by Gurley (1896), but have long been considered to \n 11\nbe tail-pieces of the crustacean Caryocaris (Ruedemann 1934; Rolfe in Theokritoff \n1964). Rolfe (1969, p. 316) stated that \u201cDawsonia\u201d is a junior synonym of \nCaryocaris Salter (1863), but did not re-examine Nicholson\u2019s material (Ian Rolfe, \npers. comm.). Though \u201cD.\u201d acuminata has all but vanished from the literature, \u201cD.\u201d \ncampanulata is often used.  \nLapworth (1876-77) considered \u201cD.\u201d campanulata to be a member of the \ncrustaceans in his catalogue of fossils from western Scotland, perhaps due to its \nsimilarity and common co-occurrence with the putative crustaceans Aptychopsis \nBarrande (1872), Peltocaris Salter (1863), and Discinocaris Woodward (1866) \n(Lapworth 1876, 1876-77; Marr & Nicholson 1888; Peach & Horne 1899). These \nputative crustaceans look similar to certain \u201cDawsonia\u201d species: disarticulated valves \nof Peltocaris and Aptychopsis are similar to \u201cD.\u201d campanulata in outline, and \nDiscinocaris has an ornament similar to that of \u201cD.\u201d rotunda and \u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata. \nHowever, none of the \u201cDawsonia\u201d material examined in this study bears the \ncharacteristic dovetail symmetry that characterises complete specimens of these other \ntaxa.  G\u00fcrich (1928) also compared \u201cD.\u201d campanulata to Peltocaris, which he \nconsidered to be the covers of a hyolithid or chiton-like organism. However, this work \noffered no firm conclusions as to the affinities of \u201cDawsonia\u201d and we have found no \nevidence of either hyolithids or chitons co-occurring in the same strata as it. \nThe affinities of Aptychopsis, Peltocaris, and Discinocaris remain uncertain. \nRolfe (1969, p. 328) noted that \u201cthey have been compared and confused with \ngraptolite \u2018swim bladders\u2019 and \u2018gonangia\u2019, eurypterid metastomata, hyolith opercula, \npolyplacophoran plates, bivalves, arthodire dermal plates, and branchiopod \ncarapaces,\u201d and he noted there was no evidence to support an affinity for either \nAptychopsis, Peltocaris, or Discinocaris with the phyllocarids. Rolfe (1969, pp. 328-\n 12\n329) suggested that these taxa may perhaps represent the aptychi of soft-bodied \ncephalopods rather than being crustacean carapaces. However, he did not go as far as \nsynonymising Aptychopsis, Peltocaris, and Discinocaris with the aptychus morpho-\ngenus Sidetes Giebel sensu Moore & Sylvester-Bradley (1957).  \nThere is no good reason to group \u201cD.\u201d campanulata with these supposed \naptychi. Indeed, neither G\u00fcrich\u2019s (1928) work nor a crustacean affinity gained serious \nconsideration in the most recent re-examination of \u201cD.\u201d campanulata, which \ntentatively reinterpreted it as an alga (S.H. Williams 1981).   \n \n1.5.2 \u201cD.\u201d rotunda and \u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata:  possible brachiopods? Neither \u201cD.\u201d \nrotunda nor \u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata are mucronate: together they form a group of small, \nsubcircular shelly-fossils. Though Nicholson (1873) stated that \u201cD.\u201d rotunda and \n\u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata appeared too variable in form and appearance to be inarticulate \nbrachiopods, this assertion was questioned from the outset (Carruthers 1867a; \nRuedemann 1904, 1934). More recently, Benton (1979) noted that some of the \nNicholson\u2019s type material may be small brachiopods.  \n \n1.5.3 Misdiagnoses. Several incompatible forms have been erroneously assigned to \n\u201cDawsonia\u201d Nicholson principally because little or no reference was made to the type \nspecimens. As Benton (1979) noted, the trace fossil Lockeia U.P. James was \nmisdiagnosed as \u201cDawsonia\u201d by U.P James\u2019s son, J.F. James (1885, 1892). As \n\u201cDawsonia\u201d is preserved as a body fossil, this name clearly cannot be applied to a \ntrace fossil (H\u00e4ntzschel 1965, 1975; Osgood 1970). However, the name \u201cDawsonia \ncycla\u201d is still used for another fossil from the Cincinnati area which consists of small, \nblack, shiny discs that are found encrusting the surfaces of nautiloid conchs. Though \n 13\nFrey (1989) thought that these discs may represent the attachment sites of the \ndendroid graptolite Mastigograptus, they are now thought to represent the epibiont \nSphenothallus (Neal & Hannibal 2000).  \n \n1.6 The current status of \u201cDawsonia\u201d Nicholson \nThe name \u201cDawsonia\u201d is still widely used by graptolite workers (e.g. Williams \n1996), though now it is almost exclusively used as shorthand for \u201cD.\u201d campanulata, \nwhich is its type species (Miller 1889). No consensus as to its taxonomic status or \nsystematic position has yet emerged. Though the genus \u201cDawsonia\u201d was conceived to \ndescribe the egg sacs of a sertularian-like hydroid, this name has been applied to \nunrelated fossils from all of the major divisions of the bilateria. Its type species, \u201cD.\u201d \ncampanulata was most recently interpreted as an alga (Williams 1981). Dawsonia \nNicholson is junior homonym of the trilobite Dawsonia Hartt in Dawson (1868). With \nall the above in mind, Nicholson\u2019s genus is in need of taxonomic revision. \n \n \n2. Material and methods used in this study \n \n2.1 Nicholson\u2019s types and comparative material \nMuch of Nicholson\u2019s type and figured material is housed in the Natural History \nMuseum [NHM], London, which purchased a collection of 1400 graptolites from \nNicholson in 1883 (Benton 1979). The unfigured portion of Nicholson\u2019s collection \nremains in the Aberdeen University Geology Department, and is catalogued in Benton \nand Trewin (1978). Nicholson\u2019s material from the Lake District lies in the Harkness \nand Marr collections of the Sedgwick Museum, Cambridge [SM]. \n 14\nThe type material of \u201cDawsonia\u201d Nicholson, as recognised by Benton (1979) \nis in the G.J. Hinde collection of the NHM. It has been re-examined and re-\naccessioned as part of this study. Nicholson did not identify any specimens from UK \nstrata in this collection as \u201cD.\u201d acuminata, despite mentioning its occurrence in \nnorthern England (Nicholson 1873). Given that Nicholson\u2019s illustrations are often \nidealised woodcuts taking features from several specimens (Benton & Trewin 1978), \nit has been impossible to precisely determine his type specimens. However, as \nNicholson\u2019s diagnoses can be recognised from his distinctive handwriting on the \nmanuscript specimen labels (Fig 2n,o), we have assigned lectotypes for each of his \nfour species. \u201cD.\u201d campanulata remains the type species of the genus (secondary \ndiagnosis, Miller 1889 contra Ruedemann 1904, 1934). Other comparative material is \nhoused in the British Geological Survey [BGS] collections at Keyworth, near \nNottingham, the Ulster Museum, Belfast [BEL] and in the Lapworth Museum, \nUniversity of Birmingham [BU].   \nIn order to compare \u201cDawsonia\u201d with the sac-like appendages of graptolites, \nwe undertook an extensive search of museum holdings and appropriate literature. \n\u201cD.\u201d campanulata-bearing localities in Moffatdale, southern Scotland, and the Lake \nDistrict of England were also recollected to provide an unbiased sample of this \nspecies. We were unable to collect field specimens of graptolites bearing sac-like \nappendages, perhaps due to their relative rarity, and we rely entirely on museum \ncollections for such graptolites.  \nIn addition to the occurrences of \u201cDawsonia\u201d noted in section 1.2 and above, \nRuedemann (1904, p. 734) commented that \u201c[\u201cD.\u201d campanulata] is very common in \nthe Trenton (Normanskill) graptolite shales of New York and Canada.\u201d However, we \nhave not been able to identify this fossil amongst Ruedemann\u2019s original collections, \n 15\nalthough there are plenty of graptolites bearing \u2018graptogonophores\u2019 in his material. In \naddition, Ruedemann (1908) reported that in 1889, H.M. Ami named three new \nspecies of \u201cDawsonia\u201d from graptolitic strata in the St Lawrence region of Canada. \nHowever, we have been unable to find any trace of Ami\u2019s \u201cDawsonia\u201d species in \neither the literature or in museum collections. Likewise, we have been unable to find \nGurley\u2019s type specimens of \u201cD.\u201d monodon and \u201cD.\u201d tridens. Though they were once \nheld in the collections of the New York State Museum, Albany, NY [NYSM] \n(Ruedemann 1934 & references therein), they are no longer in its possession. When \nRuedemann (1904) illustrated \u201cD.\u201d monodon and \u201cD.\u201d tridens specimens from \nNYSM collections, he chose examples from the Quarry at the Deep Kill, near \nMelrose, New York, only copying Gurley\u2019s drawings of the Point L\u00e9vis material. This \nsuggests that they were not in the NYSM at that time either. It may be that the \nspecimens went missing at the very end of the 1800s when a long-term budget deficit \nled James Hall to sell many specimens to keep the Geological Survey and State \nMuseum afloat (Ed Landing, pers. comm. 2004).   \nThough Ruedemann\u2019s (1904, 1934) material has been re-examined for \ncomparative purposes, neither those specimens nor Nicholson\u2019s Point L\u00e9vis \nspecimens clearly preserve the carapace. Given that Caryocaris taxonomy is primarily \nbased on carapace morphology, we are unable to determine whether Ruedemann\u2019s \nspecimens are truly synonymous with Gurley\u2019s species. As such, this paper focuses on \nclarifying Nicholson\u2019s concept of the \u201cDawsonia\u201d species, rather than entering the \nmore nebulous realm of phyllopod systematics.  \n \n2.2 Methods used and terminology employed \n 16\nAll fossils have been studied under reflected light microscopy. Additionally, uncoated \nspecimens were examined at 15KV in backscatter mode in Hitachi S-3600N and LEO \n435VP SEMs, with phases identified using energy dispersive X-ray analyses (EDS) \nusing Oxford Instruments INCA and ISIS software, respectively. The electron \nmicroscope techniques used closely follow those described in Martill et al. (1992) and \nOrr et al. (2002). Illustrated images have been digitally enhanced to increase the \ncontrast between fossil and matrix. \nDetails of repositories and specimen numbers are listed with the appropriate \nfigures and in the systematic section; details of the criteria used in the morphometric \nanalysis are given in Figure 5. As the brachiopod taxa were often incomplete, \nmorphological measurements were taken on well-preserved growth-lines as well as on \noutlines, though in each case these are clearly distinguished in the appropriate figure \ncaption. All measurements were made on camera lucida drawings of x40 or x50 \noptical magnification, and recorded to an accuracy of greater than one percent. \nMorphological terms used in systematic descriptions are as employed in \nHolmer & Popov (2000) for the brachiopod species, in Rachebouef et al. (2000) and \nreferences therein for the Caryocaris tail-pieces, and defined in Figure 5 for \u201cD.\u201d \ncampanulata.  Because Nicholson\u2019s Point L\u00e9vis material consists entirely of \ndisarticulated specimens, we have used morphological criteria to assess which forms \ncould plausibly conjoin based on the present understanding of inarticulate \nbrachiopods and Caryocaris in order to avoid unnecessary taxonomic inflation. \nAbbreviations used in the synonymy lists are those of Matthews (1973) and the \nqualifiers used in open nomenclature may be found in Bengtson (1988).  \n \n \n 17\n3. The nature of \u201cDawsonia\u201d Nicholson \n \nIt is clear that \u201cDawsonia\u201d is polyphyletic. The lectotype of \u201cD.\u201d acuminata is a \nfurcal ramus from the tail-piece of the crustacean Caryocaris acuminata (Fig. 4). \nOther fossils within the fauna include telsons and carapace fragments which are \nconsidered conspecific given the present understanding of Caryocaris morphology \n(Fig. 4d). The lectotypes of \u201cD.\u201d rotunda and \u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata are linguliform \nbrachiopods (Fig. 3c,d) and have been tentatively re-assigned to the genera \nAcrosaccus and Paterula respectively, and Nicholson\u2019s type collection also contains a \nform provisionally identified as Discotreta cf. levisensis (Fig. 3f). As no articulated \nspecimens are present we cannot unambiguously determine which shells articulated in \nlife. However, two of the four discrete shell morphotypes shown in Figure 5c have \nindistinguishable outlines (with W\/L ~1) and probably represent an unequivalved \nspecies. The other two shell morphotypes could not plausibly co-join (cf. Fig 5c), \nconsistent with there being three species present in the collection. The systematic \npalaeontology of these taxa is dealt with in section 6.  \nThe style of preservation of the above listed dawsoniids is different from the \ngraptolites which co-occur in the Point L\u00e9vis fauna, suggesting that they were \noriginally composed of non-graptolitic material. The graptolites are preserved as dull, \nblack compressions, whereas the dawsoniids are generally in relief, having a horny \ntexture and some having a bronze, pyritous sheen. EDS analyses of the Point L\u00e9vis \ndawsoniids specimens reveals that they are preserved as phosphate with some \nassociated pyrite (Fig. 6f,g). This composition is consistent with these taxa being \nlinguliform brachiopods and caryocarid arthropods rather than graptolites, which are \ncarbonaceous. Therefore, these species of \u201cDawsonia\u201d are reassigned to their \n 18\nappropriate clades and can be discounted from any consideration of graptolite \nreproduction.    \nThough Nicholson (1873) mentioned the occurrence of \u201cD.\u201d acuminata in \nEnglish strata, we have been unable to identify it in UK collections. Morphometric \nanalysis reveals that there is some overlap between \u201cD.\u201d campanulata and C. \nacuminata (Fig. 5b, d). However, even the most slender \u201cD.\u201d campanulata can be \nclearly distinguished from C. acuminata by the presence of a delineated mucro, its \nrounded latero-distal margin (Fig. 3), and its composition (Fig. 6a-d). It therefore \nseems most likely that Nicholson was either referring to slender \u201cD.\u201d campanulata \nmorphotypes as \u201cD.\u201d acuminata, or he was perhaps confusing the tail-pieces of \nCaryocaris wrighti which occur in strata of the British Isles (Rushton & Williams \n1996; Vannier et al. 2003) with C. acuminata. To avoid unnecessary confusion, we \nhave included Nicholson\u2019s so-called \u201cD.\u201d acuminata from the British Isles within our \namended definition of \u201cD.\u201d campanulata, with C. acuminata only referring to his \nCanadian material. \nThere is little similarity between \u201cD.\u201d campanulata and Caryocaris tail-pieces \n(cf. Figs 1 & 4), or indeed with the Point L\u00e9vis dawsoniids, the most notable \ndifferences being in its composition and outline. It is preserved as an organic \ncompression (Fig 6a-d) unlike Caryocaris, which is preserved in phosphate (Fig 6g). \nIt is more symmetrical than either the carapace or furcal ramus of a Caryocaris, and \nnotably more ovate than the Caryocaris telson. Its mucro is too centrally positioned to \nrepresent either an anterior horn or a postero-dorsal spine of the Caryocaris carapace, \nand it differs from the marginal spinules of the Caryocaris ramus in terms of size and \nposition. Unlike a furcal ramus, the \u201cbody\u201d of \u201cD.\u201d campanulata is ovato-triangular \nrather than ovato-parallelogrammic, and it lacks a serrated lateral margin. Though \n 19\nlacking a mucro, the grossly teardrop form of the Caryocaris telson is similar in shape \nto the \u201cbody\u201d of \u201cD.\u201d campanulata. However, morphometric analysis (Fig. 5d) \nreveals no overlap between Caryocaris telsons (where D\/L < 0.2) and \u201cD.\u201d \ncampanulata (where 0.2 < D\/L < 0.6).   \nThough \u201cD.\u201d campanulata shares a similar preservation style to the sac-like \nappendages seen in graptolites (Fig. 6a-e), there is no evidence to support a \nhomology. Whilst both are found as silvery organic films in the black shales of the \nSouthern Uplands, \u201cDawsonia\u201d cannot be recognised as a graptolite (Bulman 1970). \nMorphometric analysis reveals that the similarity between the two is superficial, with \nthe graptolite appendages having a consistently more distal centroid (Fig. 5a). They \nare also more asymmetrical and more variable in their form than \u201cD.\u201d campanulata, \nand there is no discrete transition between their connecting rods and their lobate distal \npart, which is quite unlike the transition between the mucro and the lobate \u201cbody\u201d in \n\u201cD.\u201d campanulata. Though \u201cD.\u201d campanulata may be found in close association \nwith graptolites, it is not attached to them; instead, they may be merely juxtaposed \n(e.g. Fig 1c). Neither is there any good evidence to suggest that \u201cD.\u201d campanulata is \na sac-like appendage broken from a graptolite. For one thing, its mucro tapers to a \nnarrow point, rather than having a blunt or irregular end. Indeed, the connecting rod \nand margins of the sac-like graptolite appendage seem unlikely to break readily. They \nare well-defined in most specimens, having a similar mode of preservation to the \nnema. This suggests they are recalcitrant tissues and may have possessed a noticeable \nelasticity: Crowther (1978) noted that the nema displays a certain \u2018springiness\u2019 in \nacid-isolated specimens. In summary, there is no evidence for \u201cD.\u201d campanulata \nbeing a graptolite egg-sac, or for it being related to graptolites at all.  \n 20\nA concentric, raised, nipple-like structure occurs in several specimens of \u201cD.\u201d \ncampanulata (e.g. Fig. 2f) and has previously been interpreted as evidence for it \nhaving originally had a hollow body (Williams 1981). Nicholson (1872, 1873) \nbelieved that this \u2018nipple\u2019 represented compression of a hollow three-dimensional \negg-sac onto its more rigid mucro. However this does not appear to be the case, as \nmany specimens reveal both a mucro and a \u2018nipple\u2019 (e.g. Fig 1c), and some specimens \nshow that \u201cDawsonia\u201d may only partially overlap a \u2018nipple\u2019 (Fig . 6e). Instead, SEM \ninvestigation reveals the nipples to be composed of diagenetic pyrite adopting a \nrounded and concentric habit (cf. Allison 1988; Underwood & Bottrell 1994). As \nsuch, the \u2018nipple\u2019 is best considered to be a product of compression of \u201cDawsonia\u201d \nonto pyrite formed in early (?pre-compaction) diagenesis, rather than an intrinsic part \nof the fossil. \nDetailed examination of the sac-like appendages of Hallograptus \nbimucronatus reveals that concentric lines are also present in them (Fig. 1f), cross-\nbracing better preserved margins. However, they are consistent with being the \nremnants of fusellar structures like those seen in the Orthoretiolites hami scopula \n(Bates & Kirk 1991). Such a mode of fabrication would deny the possibility that these \nstructures formed a housing from which an \u2018egg-sac\u2019 could easily detach as Nicholson \n(1868a, 1872) suggested. Nicholson believed that \u201cD.\u201d campanulata represented a \ngraptolite egg-sac that became a free-swimming entity, supposing that it was hollow \nand filled with eggs whilst housed in a cup of ramifying fibres connected to the \ngraptolite. He proposed that this \u2018ovarian vesicle\u2019 slid out once it was able to swim \nfreely. However, if Hallograptus constructed its appendages in a manner comparable \nto the scopula of O. hami, it would represent a plate-like, rather than cup-like, \nstructure (cf. Bates & Kirk 1991).   \n 21\nIndeed, it is doubtful whether sac-like graptolite appendages represent egg-\nsacs. The preponderance of these features in scalariform preservation suggests that \nthey originated from the interthecal wall rather than connecting the thecae per se, so \nthere is no direct evidence for their intimate connection with the zooid itself. \nMoreover, their regularity of form is inconsistent with what one would expect of an \nunambiguously vesicular structure such as the Climacograptus wilsoni vesicle \n(Williams 1994). Given that these structures are only known in the biserial graptolites, \nit seems unlikely that they are related to graptolite reproduction. \n \n \n4. Discussion \n \nNicholson remains one of the great early graptolite workers, despite being wrong in \nhis views of graptolite reproduction (Nicholson 1866, 1872, 1873, etc.).  It was not \nuntil Clup\u00e1\u010d (1970) discovered well-preserved caryocarids in limestone nodules from \nthe Ordovician of Bohemia that the morphology of their tail-piece was fully \nunderstood; hence, it is understandable that Nicholson (1873) did not recognise \u201cD.\u201d \nacuminata as such, despite recognising Caryocaris carapaces in the Point L\u00e9vis fauna. \nNicholson\u2019s assertion that \u201cD.\u201d rotunda and \u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata were not brachiopods \nappears at odds with his (1867a) claim that \u201cit is impossible that any palaeontologist, \npossessed of ordinary powers of observation, should fall into an error so gross [as to \nfail to recognise an inarticulate brachiopod]\u201d. \nNoting the variability of form within \u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata, for example, \nNicholson (1873, p. 142) argued that describing the species as egg-sacs allowed for \ngreater morphological plasticity, otherwise \u201cwe should have to believe there were four \n 22\nor five distinct species of brachiopods in these beds which is very unlikely\u201d (the \ninformation in Benton (1979) confirms that Nicholson was not accustomed to such \nfaunal diversity in UK sections). It appears that he conflated the beak of the \nbrachiopods with the variably positioned \u201cnipple\u201d of \u201cD.\u201d campanulata (e.g. Fig. 2), \na false homology that underpinned his \u201cDawsonia\u201d concept. So, in an age before \ntaphonomy and palaeoenvironment were generally considered, when many species \nwere only known from disarticulated fragments, Nicholson explained the vagaries of \nvariable preservation and differing morphology in a strikingly diverse fauna by \nappealing to his theory of graptolite reproduction. \n \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nThere is no evidence to support the notion that \u201cDawsonia\u201d is related to graptolite \nreproduction. Likewise, there is no strong case for sac-like appendages on graptolites \nhaving a reproductive function, given the discovery of eggs and embryos in the thecae \nof benthonic graptolites, and our knowledge of reproduction in the pterobranchs \n(Koz\u0142owski 1948; Bulman & Rickards 1966; Stebbing 1970; Dilly 1973; Hutt 1991). \nAs such, the function of these sac-like appendages remains enigmatic, and these, \nalong with the function of synrhabdosomes, should be re-examined in order to assess \nwhat, if any role either plays with regard to graptolite reproduction.  \nAll known species of \u201cDawsonia\u201d have been reassigned to valid genera \nexcept \u201cD.\u201d campanulata, which is best considered a problematicum. \u201cD.\u201d \nacuminata Nicholson, \u201cD.\u201d tridens Gurley and \u201cD.\u201d monodon Gurley represent the \ntail-pieces of Caryocaris acuminata (Nicholson 1873). We suggest that C. monodon \n 23\n(Gurley) should not apply to specimens from Point L\u00e9vis (contra Ruedemann, 1934). \n\u201cD.\u201d rotunda Nicholson is tentatively reassigned to the brachiopod genus \nAcrosaccus, and \u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata Nicholson is accommodated by the brachiopods \n?Paterula tenuistriata and Discotreta cf. levisensis (Walcott 1908). The trace fossil \nmisdiagnosed as Dawsonia Nicholson by J.F. James (1885, 1892) has long been \nknown to represent the trace fossil Lockeia U. P. James (1879) (see Benton 1979), \nwhilst \u201cDawsonia cycla\u201d most likely represents the epibiont Sphaenothallus (Frey \n1989; Neal & Hannibal 2000). \n\u201cD.\u201d campanulata is a problematicum, currently being investigated by the \nauthors. Though Dawsonia Nicholson is an invalid generic name, it would be \npremature to formally re-describe it until further information pertaining to the affinity \nof \u201cD.\u201d campanulata is available. That nobody has provided a more definite idea of \nwhat \u201cD.\u201d campanulata may represent in the hundred years since Nicholson\u2019s early \ndeath can be taken as a minor tribute to the man who clearly recognised its \nuniqueness. \n \n \n6.

NHM P1985.3 lectotype (furcal ramus). \nAdditional material.   Syntypes NHM P1977, P1982.1-3, P1984.1-2, \nP1985.3-5, P1988.3: 0 complete carapaces; 8 incomplete carapace fragments; 0 \narticulated tail-pieces; 11 well-preserved furcal rami; 7 telsons; 15 poorly-preserved \nor fragmentary furcal rami, telsons and indeterminate fragments.  \nType locality.  L\u00e9vis Shale, Point L\u00e9vis, Quebec, Canada. L\u00e9vis Formation, \nOrdovician (Arenig). \nDiagnosis.   Carapace outline indeterminate; linear corrugated ornament on \nfragments. Tail-piece with narrow triangulate telson lacking ridge or carina; furcal \nrami elongate, leaf-shaped, ca. 1.5 times longer than telson on average, with \nacuminate distal margin, bearing large, triangular, posteriorly-directed spines along \ntheir outer margin; distinctive narrow ridge and furrow adjacent to its proximal inner \nmargin along its proximal third. Telson ranges from 1.8-2.9 mm in length and 0.9-1.5 \n 26\nmm in width. Furcal ramus ranges from 2.7-6.1 mm in length and 1.3-2.5 mm in \nwidth; smaller specimens may have two marginal spines (e.g. Fig. 4b), larger \nspecimens are stouter and more asymmetrical and have three marginal spines (e.g. \nFig. 4a, 6g)   \nRemarks.   Until the morphology of its carapace is better known, C. \nacuminata should remain a species separate from C. monodon and other caryocarids. \nC. acuminata refers exclusively to caryocarids from Point L\u00e9vis and C. monodon \nrefers to caryocarids from the exposure at the Deep Kill at Melrose, as laid out in the \nsynonymy above. Though the outline of the tail piece is similar in both localities, the \nmorphology of the tail-piece alone is not well enough placed in the hierarchy of \ncharacters to determine synonymy at a species level (Racheboeuf, Vannier & Ortega \n2000, p. 328). The variation in number of marginal spines may represent allometric \ngrowth (cf. Rushton & Williams 1996); however, small spines may not necessarily be \napparent on poorly preserved specimens (see Fig. 4b). \nAs the type specimens of C. oblongus Gurley, \u201cD.\u201d monodon Gurley and \n\u201cD.\u201d tridens Gurley are presumed lost, Nicholson\u2019s material assumes topotype status. \nTherefore, these species can be suppressed as junior synonyms. This is supported by \ncomparison with Gurley\u2019s original descriptions and illustrations: \u201cD.\u201d tridens \ncorresponds exactly with our observations on the furcal ramus of C. acuminata\u00b8 \nwhilst \u201cD.\u201d monodon most likely represents an articulated Caryocaris tail-piece \npreserved in lateral view. C. oblongus presumably represents the fragments of a \ncarapace. Nicholson (1873) also noted Caryocaris carapace fragments in the Point \nL\u00e9vis fauna. Similarly, Caryocarus [sic] curvilatus, described as an aberrant \ngraptolite in Gurley (1896), is most likely an articulated abdomen and tail-piece. \nLikewise, we wholeheartedly concur with Ruedemann (1904, 1934) that \u201cD.\u201d \n 27\nmonodon and \u201cD.\u201d tridens represent parts of a crustacean rather than being unusual \ngraptolites. \n Though no articulated specimens are present in Nicholson\u2019s collection, it \nseems more parsimonious to describe the disarticulated parts as one species rather \nthan several. Nicholson described \u201cD.\u201d acuminata prior to mentioning the specimens \nwhich he referred to Caryocaris sp. As such, there seems little controversy in \nretaining the specific name acuminata, which refers to the pointed end of the furcal \nramus. \n \nPhylum Brachiopoda Dum\u00e9ril, 1806 \nSubphylum Linguliformea Williams et al., 1996 \nClass Lingulata Gorjansky & Popov, 1985 \n \nRemarks.   We place the three species of brachiopods from Nicholson\u2019s Point \nL\u00e9vis  material within the Lingulata on the basis of their organophosphatic \ncomposition,  rudimentary articulation and larval shells. As noted above, many \nauthors have considered them to be brachiopods, though they have not been formally \nassigned to the phylum until now. \n \nOrder Lingulida Waagen, 1885 \nSuperfamily Linguloidea Menke, 1828 \nFamily Paterulidae Cooper, 1956  \nGenus Paterula Barrande, 1879 \n \nnon 1868  Dawsonia Hartt in Dawson, p. 655. \n 28\n p. 1873  Dawsonia Nicholson, p. 139-140 pars. \n* 1879 Paterula n. gen.

Growth lines \ncontinuous and fine, equally prominent, regular 0.04-0.1 mm spacing throughout the \nvalve. \nRemarks. Though this genus is typically unequivalved, only a single valve is \npresent in Nicholson\u2019s collections. As Dawsonia Nicholson is an invalid taxon there \nis no conflict of names. While there is some similarity between this form and the \nyounger taxon P. cf. portlocki Geinitz (1852) as illustrated by Henningsmoen in \nWaern et al. (1948), the material described herein is too poorly preserved to properly \ncompare the taxa. As such, Nicholson\u2019s collections need to be supplemented with \n 29\nadditional material exhibiting the shell\u2019s internal view before this taxon can be \nprecisely placed. Therefore, we have kept the taxon in open nomenclature.  \n \nSuperfamily Discinoidea Gray, 1840 \nFamily Discinidae Gray, 1840 \nGenus Acrosaccus?

Beak slightly submarginal on one valve and submarginal to subcentral on \nthe other. Anterior-posterior valve length 2.1-2.9 mm, valve breadth 2.1-3.0 \n 30\nmm; length-breadth ratio 0.95-1.1, typically slightly elongate. Growth lines \ncontinuous, some more prominent, regular 0.05-0.1 mm spacing, growth lines more \nclearly defined towards the anterior margin, particularly in valve with submarginal to \nsubcentral beak. \nRemarks.   Though no articulated specimen is known, the two valves can be \ninferred as belonging to a single species as their outlines are indistinguishable, \nsuggesting they once did meet.  By comparison with the type species, A. schuleri \nWillard (1928), the valve with the more marginal beak is assumed to be the dorsal \nvalve, and the valve with the more central beak being the pedicle valve.  \nAs Dawsonia Nicholson is an invalid taxon there is no conflict of names. \nHowever, Nicholson\u2019s collections need to be supplemented with additional material \ndisplaying conjoined valves and internal views for the generic assignment to be \nconfirmed. Until then the taxon should remain in open nomenclature.  \nWe have corrected Nicholson\u2019s use of the name \u2018rotunda\u2019 to \u2018rotundus\u2019 as the \nlatter is the neuter gender singular of the nominative case. \n \n \nSuperfamily?

Shell unequivalved with transversely suboval outline, equally \nbiconvex. Apex submarginal to subcentral and posteriorly positioned, seemingly more \nsubmarginal in one valve than the other. Anterior-posterior length 1.0-2.6 mm, valve \nbreadths 1.2-3.4 mm, typical breadth around 3 mm; length-breadth ratio 0.65-0.9, \ntypically 0.8; maximum breadth at anterior posterior midpoint. Growth lines \ncontinuous, more clearly defined away from the apex, regular 0.06-0.11 mm spacing \nthroughout the valve. \nRemarks.   The quality of preservation, especially the lack of internal \nfeatures, precludes precise assignment. The valve with the most submarginal apex is \nmost likely the ventral valve by comparison with the specimens of Di. levisensis \nillustrated in Holmer & Popov (2000, Fig. 47, 2a-d).  \nThis species was originally accommodated in Nicholson\u2019s (1873) concept of \n\u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata which allowed for considerable variation in the position of the apex \nby comparison with the variably positioned \u2018nipples\u2019 (actually diagenetic pyrite) in \n\u201cD.\u201d campanulata. However, as Nicholson\u2019s description is of an elongate oval fossil, \nit seems best to remove this form from \u201cD.\u201d tenuistriata and compare it with Di. \nlevisensis. As it is unknown whether Nicholson\u2019s Point L\u00e9vis material was collected \nfrom the precise locality and horizon of Walcott (1908), this material should not be \nassigned topotype status. \n \n \nPhylum, Class, Order & Family uncertain \nGenus \u201cDawsonia\u201d Nicholson \n \nnon 1858  Dawsonia Hartt in Dawson, p. 655. \n 33\np. 1873  Dawsonia Nicholson, pp. 139-140, pars. \np. 1889 Dawsonia Nicholson; Miller, p. 184. \nnon 1904 Caryocaris Salter; Ruedemann pp. 738-742. \nnon 1969  Caryocaris Salter; Rolfe in Moore, p. 316. \nnon 1970 Lockeia James; Osgood, pp. 308-312. \np. 1981 Dawsonia Nicholson; Williams, p. 55. \nnon 1989  \u201cDawsonia\u201d; Frey, Fig 7. \n \n Type species. \u201cDawsonia\u201d campanulata Nicholson; secondary diagnosis, \nMiller (1889). \n Diagnosis.

As genus. \n Remarks. \u201cD.\u201d campanulata cannot be easily accommodated in any higher \ntaxonomic group. It is clearly unrelated to graptolite scopulae, and bears little \nsimilarly to either phyllocarids or algae. Although recent works have tried to \naccommodate it in these groups (cf. Rolfe 1969 and Williams 1981, respectively), \nneither assignment is entirely convincing. Meanwhile, Underwood (1993, Fig 4e) \nillustrated a carbonaceous fossil that looks conspicuously \u201cDawsonia\u201d-like as a faecal \npellet. In the most detailed recent study of \u201cDawsonia\u201d, Williams (1981) argued that \n 35\nit represented a spore-carrying alga. He stated that \u201cD.\u201d campanulata had an open, \nflared \u201cposterior margin, giving the [hollow] body a \u2018crocus flower\u2019 type of \nappearance\u201d. However, it is an order of magnitude larger than such spore-carrying \nalga in the modern oceans (Tappan 1980) and there is no evidence to suggest it had \nsignificant three-dimensionality in life. The \u2018nipples\u2019 seen associated with \u201cD.\u201d \ncampanulata superficially suggest a three dimensionality, but, as noted in section 3, \nthey actually represent compression of the fossil on to diagenetic pyrite in the \nsediment. This pyrite notably differs in fabric from the pyrite infill of hollow cavities \n(cf. Allison 1988; Underwood & Bottrell 1994). Moreover, \u201cD.\u201d campanulata lacks \nthe morphological variation seen when unambiguously hollow tissues such as the \nClimacograptus wilsoni vesicle are found flattened in these shales (cf. Williams \n1994). And, although the distal margin of \u201cD.\u201d campanulata\u2019s lobate body may be \nfragmented (e.g. Fig. 1b), and, at times, less-well delineated than the proximal end \nand mucro (e.g. Fig. 6b), there are many examples showing a well-defined, rounded \ndistal margin (e.g. Figs 1a,c & 6a,c), suggesting that this represents variability in \npreservation rather than a crocus-flower-like morphology. With this in mind, \n\u201cDawsonia\u201d is best considered to be a flat problematicum rather than a hollow alga.   \n \n \n7.
