To understand the role\nof beta (\u0001)4 integrin in directional migration, the migratory paths of either primary human keratinocytes (NHK), \u00014\nintegrin-null human keratinocytes (\u00014\u0002), or those in which \u00014 integrin was reexpressed (\u00014\u0003), were tracked during\nexposure to EFs of physiological magnitude (100 mV\/mm). Although the expression of \u00014 integrin had no effect on the rate\nof cell movement, it was essential for directional (cathodal) migration in the absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF).\nThe addition of EGF potentiated the directional response, suggesting that at least two distinct but synergistic signaling\npathways coordinate galvanotaxis. Expression of either a ligand binding\u2013defective \u00014 (\u00014\u0003AD) or \u00014 with a truncated\ncytoplasmic tail (\u00014\u0003CT) resulted in loss of directionality in the absence of EGF, whereas inhibition of Rac1 blinded the\ncells to the EF even in the presence of EGF. In summary, both the \u00014 integrin ligand\u2013binding and cytoplasmic domains\ntogether with EGF were required for the synergistic activation of a Rac-dependent signaling pathway that was essential\nfor keratinocyte directional migration in response to a galvanotactic stimulus.\nINTRODUCTION\nDirectional migration is a fundamental process essential for\nnumerous cellular responses including embryonic develop-\nment, inflammation, and tumor metastasis as well as skin\nwound repair. When skin is wounded, keratinocytes mi-\ngrate directionally into the wound bed to initiate reepithe-\nlialization, necessary for wound closure and restoration of\nbarrier function. Many factors are involved in orchestrating\nthe complex process of wound healing (Martin, 1997), and\nrecent studies have led to the belief that a lateral electric field\n(EF) generated immediately upon wounding is one of the\nearliest signals to initiate directed cell migration (Ojingwa\nand Isseroff, 2003; McCaig et al., 2005). The lateral EF is\ndriven by the transepithelial potential through the low-re-\nsistance wound pathway, creating a negative pole (cathode)\nat the center of the wound (Borgens et al., 1977). Endogenous\nDC EFs of 40\u2013200 mV\/mm have been measured near wounds\nin mammalian epithelia (Barker et al., 1982; McGinnis and\nVanable, 1986; Chiang et al., 1992; Sta Iglesia et al., 1996; Sta\nIglesia and Vanable, 1998). Skin-derived keratinocytes can\nsense an EF of this magnitude within minutes, reform their\nlamellipodia facing the cathode, and migrate directionally in\nvitro, a process known as galvanotaxis (Nishimura et al.,\n1996). The mechanism for keratinocyte sensing of the EF is\nlargely unknown, but a role for Ca2\u0001 influx (Trollinger et al.,\n2002; Fang et al., 1998), epidermal growth factor receptor\n(EGFR) phosphorylation (Fang et al., 1999), and cAMP-de-\npendent PKA (Pullar et al., 2001; Pullar and Isseroff, 2005)\nhave been implicated in previous work from this laboratory.\nThus, in addition to providing a physiological mechanism\nfor rapid orientation of directional migration of keratino-\ncytes in wound healing, the galvanotaxis response of cells in\nvitro provides an experimental paradigm for dissecting the\nmechanisms that underlie directional migratory responses\nof cells.\n\u00016\u00024 integrin, a receptor for laminin 332, plays a critical\nstructural role in keratinocytes, localizing to the hemides-\nmosome (HD) and providing tight anchorage of basal kera-\ntinocytes to the basement membrane (Sonnenberg et al.,\n1991). Indeed, in patients expressing a null mutation of the\n\u00024 integrin, epidermal blistering occurs because of the poor\nadhesion of the epidermis to the basement membrane (Nies-\nsen et al., 1996; van der Neut et al., 1996). However, the \u00016\u00024\nintegrin can switch from a structural adhesive role to a\nsignaling component involved in cell migration. On wound-\ning, growth factors secreted in the wound can transform\nThis article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press\n(http:\/\/www.molbiolcell.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1091\/mbc.E06\u201305\u20130433)\non August 16, 2006.\nPresent addresses: \u2020 Department of Cell Physiology and Pharmacol-\nogy, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 9HN, United Kingdom;\n\u00a7 Molecular and Cellular Biology, Cytokinetics Inc., 280 East Grand\nAvenue, South San Francisco, CA 94080; \u0002 Department of Pathology,\nColumbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New\nYork, NY 11032.\nAddress correspondence to: R.

This is accompanied by the disassembly of the HD and\nthe relocalization of \u00016\u00024 integrin from the HD to the la-\nmellipodia of migrating cells (Marikovsky et al., 1993; Maini-\nero et al., 1996; Martin, 1997; Santoro et al., 2003). The ligand\nfor this integrin, laminin 332 (also called laminin 5), is se-\ncreted by keratinocytes both in culture (Marinkovich et al.,\n1992; Ryan et al., 1996) and at the leading edge of an epider-\nmal outgrowth into the wound bed (Sonnenberg et al., 1991;\nRyan et al., 1999), providing a suitable binding partner for\nthe integrin as the cell migrates.\nPreviously, the \u00016\u00024 integrin has been implicated in the\nchemotaxis response of keratinocytes, where it plays a role\nin EGF-induced cell migration through the sustained activa-\ntion of Rac1 (Russell et al., 2003). Mechanisms regulating\ndirectional migration in response to EF could be similar. Just\nas actin is polymerized preferentially at the leading edge of\nneutrophils during chemotaxis (Zigmond, 1977; Devreotes and\nZigmond, 1988), it similarly accumulates at the cathodal-facing\nedge of corneal epithelial cells migrating directionally in an\napplied EF (Zhao et al., 1999). Additionally, the EGFR is\npolarized in both corneal epithelial cell (Zhao et al., 2002)\nand keratinocyte (Fang et al., 1998, 1999) galvanotaxis and is\nrequired for fibroblast directional migration toward fi-\nbronectin or laminin (Li et al., 1999). With this possible\nsimilarity in mind, we investigated the signaling roles of\nboth the \u00016\u00024 integrin and EGFR in the galvanotaxis re-\nsponse in keratinocytes.\nHere we describe the novel role for \u00024 integrin in kera-\ntinocyte galvanotaxis and delineate the corresponding sig-\nnaling pathways. We report that although the expression of\n\u00024 integrin appears to have no effect on rate of migration on\na collagen substrate, it is critical for EF-mediated directional\nmigration. In the absence of exogenously supplied EGF, \u00024\nintegrin-null cells cannot respond with directional migra-\ntion. The \u00024 integrin coordinates with EGF to initiate and\nmaintain persistent, robust cathodal migration. The \u00024 inte-\ngrin extracellular laminin-binding domain and its functional\ncytoplasmic domain are both required for \u00024 integrin\u2013me-\ndiated galvanotaxis. We demonstrate that Rac1 is the com-\nmon downstream target for both \u00024 integrin\u2013mediated and\nEGF-mediated directional migration in an EF. Therefore, the\nmolecular mechanisms underpinning both chemotaxis and\ngalvanotaxis employ Rac1 as a critical mediator of direc-\ntional responses.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPrimary Human Keratinocytes\nPrimary human keratinocytes (NHK) were isolated from neonatal foreskins as\nwe have reported previously (Isseroff et al., 1987; Pullar et al., 2006), under an\napproved exemption granted by the Internal Review Board at the University\nof California, Davis and cultured using a modification of the method of\nRheinwald and Green (1975). NHKs were grown in keratinocyte growth\nmedium (KGM; Epilife, 0.06 mM Ca2\u0001; Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR),\nsupplemented with human keratinocyte growth supplement (0.2 ng\/ml EGF,\n5 \u0003g\/ml insulin, 5 \u0003g\/ml transferrin, 0.18 \u0003g\/ml hydrocortisone, and 0.2%\nbovine pituitary extract; Cascade Biologics) and antibiotics (100 U\/ml peni-\ncillin, 100 \u0003g\/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 \u0003g\/ml amphotericin; Gemini Bio-\nProducts, Calabasas, CA) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell\nstrains isolated from at least three different foreskins were used in all exper-\niments, performed with subcultured cells between passages 3 and 7.\nCell Lines\nPrimary human keratinocytes lacking \u00024 integrin were obtained from a\npatient with epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (EB-PA) resulting\nfrom a premature termination codon (C658X; Russell et al., 2003). Neonatal\nforeskin keratinocytes and EB-PA patient keratinocytes were immortalized\nwith HPV18 E6 and E7 genes (Kaur et al., 1989) and designated NIK and \u00024\u0002,\nrespectively. Cells were cultured in equal parts defined keratinocyte serum\nfree medium (SFM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and keratinocyte medium 154\n(Cascade Biologics). Culture media contained 100 IU\/ml penicillin and 100\nIU\/ml streptomycin, and cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2\nincubator.\ncDNA Constructs and Vectors\nThe cloning of the \u00024 integrin gene (\u00024\u0001) and the adhesion defective \u00024\nintegrin gene (\u00024\u0001AD) have been described previously (Russell et al., 2003).\nThe cDNAs for the constitutively active and inactive Rac1 mutants, V12Rac1\nand N17Rac1, were a kind gift of Dr. Alan Hall (University College London,\nUnited Kingdom) and were cloned as EcoRI fragments into the retroviral\nexpression vector LZRS (Kinsella and Nolan, 1996) containing the encepha-\nlomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-IRES and blasticidin-resistance sequences (Deng\net al., 1998). To generate the \u00024 integrin construct with a truncated cytoplas-\nmic domain, (\u00024\u0001CT) the WT \u00024 integrin cDNA was removed from the LZRS\nretroviral expression vector by EcoRI digestion and subsequently cloned into\nthe EcoRI site of the pENTR1A vector (Invitrogen). The COOH-terminal\nregion of the \u00024 cytoplasmic deletion mutant \u000241\u20131217 was obtained by PCR\nusing \u00024-del (sac)-5\u0003 (AGTACTGGATTCAGGGTGACTCCG, sense) and \u00024-\n1217\u0001EcoRV-3\u0003 (TAGATATCAGTGGGTGCGGCAGGACACCA, antisense)\nprimers and subsequently exchanged with WT \u00024 in pENTR1A. The reverse\nprimer included a stop codon followed by the EcoRV site. PCR was per-\nformed using Takara Ex Taq (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) with the \u00024 WT cDNA in\nLZRS as a template. The PCR fragment was cloned into a T-Easy vector\n(Promega, Madison, WI; \u000241\u20131217 in T-Easy), and its sequence was verified.\nThe SacI\/EcoRV fragment from \u000241\u20131217 in T-Easy was ligated into the SacI\/\nEcoRV site within the WT \u00024 in pENTR1A. Finally, \u000241\u20131217 cDNA was\nrecombined from the pENTR1A to the LZRS retroviral expression vector,\nincluding a Gateway cassette, using the LR Clonase II Enzyme mix (Invitro-\ngen) by a recombination reaction.\nRetroviral Transduction\nKeratinocytes were transduced with retroviral vectors for the stable expres-\nsion of WT \u00024 integrin (\u00024\u0001), \u00024\u0001AD, V12Rac1, N17Rac1, and \u00024\u0001CT\nconstructs. Amphotropic retrovirus was produced in modified 293 cells as\npreviously described (Kinsella and Nolan, 1996). Keratinocytes, 2 \u0004 105, were\nincubated in serum-free medium (SFM) containing 5 \u0003g\/ml poybrene for 15\nmin before infection. Medium was removed and 10 ml of retroviral superna-\ntant containing 5 \u0003g\/ml polybrene (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to both\nviral supernatant and keratinocyte media. Medium was removed, and 4 ml of\nretroviral supernatant was added. Plates were centrifuged at 300 \u0004 g for 1 h\nat 32\u00b0C using a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).\nCells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h followed by replacement with fresh SFM\nand selection with 5 \u0003g\/ml blasticidin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Selection\nwas omitted for primary cell cultures.\nFigure 1 (facing page). \u00024 integrin and EGF are both required for\nkeratinocyte directional migration. \u00024\u0001, \u00024\u0002, and NHKs were\nstarved for 16 h in basal medium containing no growth factors.\nCells, 2 \u0004 104,were plated in the presence or absence of 2 ng\/ml\nEGF on the collagen-coated glass in the center of the galvanotaxis\nchambers as described in Materials and Methods. An electric field (EF)\nof 100 mV\/mm was applied across the cells, and images were\ncaptured every 10 min over a 1-h period. The speed (\u0003m\/min; A)\nand directionality (cosine; B) of migration were calculated as de-\nscribed in Materials and Methods. (A) The speed of migration for \u00024\u0002\nand \u00024\u0001 cells in the presence and absence of EGF is shown. The\nnumber of cells is as follows: \u00024\u0002, no EGF, n \u0005 64; \u00024\u0001, no EGF,\nn\u0005 113; \u00024\u0002, EGF, n\u0005 98 and \u00024\u0001, EGF, n\u0005 81. *p\u0006 0.01 between\nall conditions and those in the presence of EGF. (B) The cosine of\nmigration for \u00024\u0002 and \u00024\u0001 cells in the presence and absence of EGF\nis shown. *p \u0006 0.01 between all conditions and \u00024\u0001 \u0001 EGF. (C) To\nclearly demonstrate the directionality and rate of migration for each\ncondition the data were plotted using a circle graph. Each cell\u2019s\nposition at time (t) \u0005 0 is at the origin (0,0), and its final position is\nat the end of the 1-h exposure to the EF is plotted as a single point\non the graph. The radius of each circle represents 100 \u0003M of trans-\nlocation distance. The cathode is at the top of each graph (0o) and\nthe anode is at the bottom (180o). The data shown are combined\nfrom at least four independent experiments. (D) The speed and\ndirectionality for NHKs in the presence and absence of EGF is\npresented (NHK, no EGF, n \u0005 59; NHK, EGF, n \u0005 78). *p \u0006 0.01\nbetween all conditions and those in the presence of EGF. The data\nshown are combined from at least four independent experiments on\nthree separate cell strains.

Mouse mAb ASC-8 is inhibitory to\n\u00016\u00024 attachment and was used in all inhibition assays at 10 \u0003g\/ml. Mouse\nmonoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (h-vin-1) was purchased from Sigma. The\nspecific Rac1 inhibitor 553502 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego,\nCA) in solution and used at a concentration of 100 \u0003M.\nCell Treatments\nCells were starved of growth factors in basal medium (Epilife containing\nantibiotics [100 U\/ml penicillin, 100 \u0003g\/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 \u0003g\/ml\namphotericin]) for 16 h, before plating for galvanotaxis studies. Cells were\nplated in the presence or absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF; Invitro-\ngen), 2 ng\/ml for 3 h before EF application. ASC-8 was added to the cells for\n10 min before plating. Cells were preincubated with the Rac1 inhibitor for 30\nmin before EF application. Galvanotaxis was performed in the presence or\nabsence of EGF, ASC-8, or 553502.\nGalvanotaxis\nThe galvanotaxis chamber construction and DC application were performed\nas described previously (Pullar and Isseroff, 2005). Briefly, the galvanotaxis\nchamber is composed of a rectangular Plexiglas frame with two medium\nreservoirs on opposite sides to which a 45 \u0004 50-mm piece of No. 1.5 glass\ncoverslip is attached to form the chamber bottom. This allows for continuous\nobservation of the plated cells on an inverted microscope. Keratinocytes,\n2 \u0004 104, are plated onto the collagen-coated center of the chamber between\ntwo 25 \u0004 10-mm coverslip spacers and allowed to attach for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. A\nthird 25-mm2 coverslip is placed on top, straddling the two spacer coverslips\nand covering the cells plated on the collagen-coated center panel. This third\ncoverslip rests \u0007100\u2013105 \u0003m above the center panel and is sealed on top of\nthe spacer coverslips with silicone high-vacuum grease (Dow Corning, Mid-\nland, MI). This small height is chosen to minimize the cross-sectional area\nthrough which current flows. A small cross-section creates a high-resistance\npathway, resulting in a higher voltage gradient for a fixed current. The\naqueduct allows for medium and current flow across the cells. The voltage\nacross the coverslip is measured using a voltmeter via silver-sliver chloride\n(Ag-AgCl) wire electrodes inserted into both medium reservoirs on either\nside of the center panel. Six-centimeter-long 2% agar\/phosphate-buffered\nsaline\u2013filled pieces of polypropylene tubing connect each end of the chamber\nto a medium-filled well in which the Ag-AgCl electrodes are placed, to separate\npossible electrode byproducts from the cells themselves. A 100-mV\/mm current\nis applied across the chamber. The current is measured with an ammeter in\nseries, and we only use chambers for which the current flow is kept below 0.6\nmA, to minimize joule heating. Furthermore, temperature of the medium in the\nchambers is maintained at 36\u00b0C by placing the chamber on a metal plate heated\nto and maintained at 39\u00b0C. The temperature is continuously monitored during\nthe experiment using a YSI 400 analog temperature probe (Yellow Springs\nInstrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH) directly attached to the metal plate and\ndoes not vary by more than 1\u00b0C over the course of the experiment.\nTime-Course Observation and Data Analysis\nThe galvanotaxis chambers rest on inverted Nikon microscopes (Melville,\nNY), and control and test assays were run simultaneously on duplicate setups\nside by side. Time-lapse images of the cell migratory response are digitally\ncaptured every 10 min over a 1-h period by a QImaging Retiga-EX cameras\n(Burnaby, BC, Canada) controlled by a custom automation written in Impro-\nvision Openlab software (Lexington, MA) on a Macintosh G4 (Apple Com-\nputer, Cupertino, CA). After each cell\u2019s center of mass is tracked using the\nOpenlab software, directionality of migration is calculated and imported to\nExcel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Cosine \u0004 describes the direction of migra-\ntion and is a measure of the persistence of cathodal directedness, where \u0004 is\nthe angle between the field axis and the vector drawn by the cell migration\npath. The average cosine \u0004 \u0005 \bi cos \u0004i\/N, where \bi is the summation of\n50\u2013150 individual cells from at least three different cell strains. Angle zero\n(\u0004 \u0005 0\u00b0) is assigned to the negative pole (cathode) and increasing angles\nassigned in a clockwise manner, with q \u0005 180\u00b0 aligned with the positive pole\n(anode). Therefore, the cosine \u0004 will provide a number between \u00021 and \u00011,\nand the average of all of the separate cell events yields an index of directional\nmigration. For example, if a cell were to move directly to the negative pole,\nthe angle \u0004\u0005 0\u00b0 and the cosine \u0004\u0005 1. \u201cCosine,\u201d therefore, refers to the average\ndirectional migration index of separate cell migration events at the end of a\n1-h period. Results are given as average cosine \u0004 \t the SEM. Significance is\ntaken as p \u0006 0.01, using Student\u2019s t test (unpaired) to compare the means of\ntwo cell populations.\nThe rate and directionality of migration can be clearly represented graph-\nically using a polar plot. Each cell is placed at the origin of the circle at time\n0, and its final position is plotted as a single point on the graph. The distance\nof the points from the origin provides an indication of cell migration rate and\nthe distribution of points between the four quadrants indicates the direction\nof migration. The radius of each graph is 100 \u0003M.\nImmunofluorescence Staining and Microscopy\nSterile glass cover slips (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) were transferred\ninto 12-well dishes and collagen-coated with 60 \u0003g\/ml collagen I (Vitrogen\n100; Collagen, Palo Alto, CA) in KGM for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Coverslips were washed\nthree times with KGM, and 3 \u0004 104 cells were added per well and allowed to\nattach for 3 h. Coverslips were processed at room temperature unless other-\nwise noted. Coverslips were washed twice in PBS and fixed for 10 min in 4%\nparaformaldehyde. Coverslips were washed twice in PBS between each step.\nCells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100\/PBS and blocked\nwith 5% goat serum\/PBS for 20 min. Primary monoclonal anti-\u00024 integrin\nantibody (3E1; 1:50) or primary monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody (h-vin-1;\n1:100) was added dropwise in 1% goat serum\/PBS (1:100) and incubated for\n1 h at 37\u00b0C. A goat anti-mouse cy3 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch\nLaboratory, West Grove, PA; 1:100) was added in 1% goat serum\/PBS for 1 h\nat 37\u00b0C. Standard controls were performed. Coverslips were incubated with\nthe primary antibody alone or the secondary antibody alone to ensure spec-\nificity. Finally, Prolong gold anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)\nwas used according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions to mount the coverslips\nonto glass microscope slides. Slides were viewed on an inverted fluorescent\nNikon Diaphot microscope using a 40\u0004 pan fluor objective. Images were\ncaptured using QImaging Retiga-EX cameras and are presented in gray scale\n(\u00024 integrin) or pseudocolored red (vinculin).\nRESULTS\nBoth \u00014 Integrin and EGF Are Required for Keratinocyte\nDirectional Migration\nKeratinocytes will quickly attach to collagen-coated culture\nplates, and within 3 h the majority of the cells will develop\na motile phenotype, with a characteristic crescent shape and\na broad lamellipodium along the convex side of the cell.\nThey will begin to secrete laminin 332 during this time frame\n(Marinkovich et al., 1992), switching from collagen- to lami-\nnin-dependent adhesion and signaling (Nguyen et al., 2000a,\n2000b; Frank and Carter, 2004).\nTo determine the role that \u00024 integrin plays in both ker-\natinocyte motility and directional migration within a DC EF,\nhuman keratinocyte cell lines lacking the \u00024 integrin (\u00024\u0002),\nthose in which the \u00024 integrin has been reexpressed (\u00024\u0001),\nor primary human keratinocytes (NHK) were examined for\ntheir migratory response in an EF. We have previously\ndemonstrated that the application of a DC EF does not alter\nthe keratinocyte migration rate (Nishimura et al., 1996;\nPullar and Isseroff, 2005). The absence (\u00024\u0002) or presence\n(\u00024\u0001) of \u00024 integrin appears to have no effect on the rate of\ncell migration in this system, whereas the application of EGF\nsignificantly increases their speed by 81 and 57%, respec-\ntively (Figure 1A).\nIn contrast, directional migration is markedly affected by\nthe absence of the \u00024 integrin. The \u00024\u0002 cells, in the absence\nof EGF, are blinded to the directional stimulus (Figure 1B)\nand migrate randomly. Reexpression of \u00024 integrin (\u00024\u0001)\npartially (61%) restores directional migration in the absence\nof EGF, whereas the directional responses of \u00024\u0002 and \u00024\u0001\ncells are both potentiated in the presence of EGF (Figure 1B).\n\u00024\u0001 cells are 69% more directional than \u00024\u0002 cells in the\npresence of EGF. To clearly demonstrate these differences,\nthe rate and directionality of migration for the \u00024\u0002 and \u00024\u0001\ncells are represented graphically using a polar plot as de-\nscribed. Although the distance from the origin of \u00024\u0002 and\n\u00024\u0001 cells is similar in the absence of EGF, more cells are\npresent in the top two quadrants in the presence of \u00024\nintegrin, demonstrating that reexpression of the \u00024 integrin\npartially restores directional migration in \u00024\u0002 cells and fully\nrestores directional migration in \u00024\u0001 cells (as visualized by\nthe majority of cells plotted in the top two quadrants in polar\nplot Figure 1C). In primary human keratinocytes (NHK;\nFigure 1D), EGF also potentiates both motility and direc-\ntional migration in response to the applied EF. It appears,\ntherefore, that there are at least two distinct but synergistic\nC. E.

In stark contrast, however,\n\u00024\u0001AD cells are blinded to the EF in the absence of EGF and\nmigrate randomly (Figure 2A). The inclusion of EGF in the\nmedium recovers some of the directional deficit, as it does in\nthe \u00024\u0002 cells. Indeed, their responses to the EF are very\nsimilar to \u00024\u0002 cells (Figure 2A).\nTo confirm the dependence of the results on laminin 332\nbinding, we preincubated \u00024\u0001 cells and NHKs with an\nantibody known to inhibit the attachment of \u00024 integrin to\nlaminin 332 (ASC-8). The effect of ASC-8 on EF-mediated\ndirectional migration of \u00024\u0001 cells and NHKs is similar. The\nantibody blinds both \u00024\u0001 cells and NHKs to the EF in the\nabsence of EGF and they migrate randomly, whereas the abil-\nity to sense and respond to the EF is partially restored by EGF\nto 43 and 54% of the directionality observed for \u00024\u0001 cells,\nrespectively (Figure 2, B and C).\nThe Cytoplasmic Tail of \u00014 Integrin Is Essential for \u00014\nIntegrin\u2013mediated Keratinocyte Directional Migration in\nthe Absence of EGF\nIntegrins transmit signals from the extracellular matrix by\nthe association of adapter proteins with their cytoplasmic\ntails (CT; Giancotti and Ruoslahti, 1999). Previously, it has\nbeen demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tail of \u00024 integrin is\nessential for the \u00016\u00024-mediated activation of signaling path-\nways required for the anchorage-independent survival of\nmammary tumors (Zahir et al., 2003) and for epidermal\ngrowth and wound healing (Nikolopoulos et al., 2005). To\nfurther examine the role of the \u00024 integrin in EF-mediated\ndirectional migration, we expressed a \u00024 integrin construct\nlacking a cytoplasmic tail in \u00024\u0002 cells (\u00024\u0001CT). There was\nno decrease in the rate of migration between \u00024\u0001 and\n\u00024\u0001CT cells in the absence or presence of EGF (unpublished\ndata), suggesting that the B4 cytoplasmic tail and its down-\nstream signaling are not critical components for motility per\nse. In contrast, however, the \u00024\u0001CT cells are unable to sense\nand respond with directional migration to the EF in the\nabsence of EGF, indicating the requirement of the \u00024 cyto-\nplasmic tail for the response (Figure 3). Addition of EGF\npartially rescues the directional response in the \u00024\u0001CT cells,\nagain suggesting that a second, \u00024 integrin\u2013independent,\nEGF-mediated signaling pathway is required for a direc-\ntional migratory response to an applied EF (Figure 3).\nRac1 Is the Common Downstream Target for Both \u00014\nIntegrin- and EGF-mediated Directional Migration in an EF\nThe small Rho guanosine triphosphatase Rac1 has been\nshown to play a role in chemotaxis, and its absence prevents\nneutrophils from responding to a chemoattractant with di-\nrectional migration (Merlot and Firtel, 2003; Sun et al., 2004).\nBecause Rac1 is required for \u00024 integrin\u2013mediated EGF-\ndependent chemotaxis (Russell et al., 2003), we speculated\nthat Rac1 could likewise mediate either the \u00024 integrin\u2013\nmediated or the EGFR-mediated galvanotaxis response, or\nboth. To test this hypothesis, a dominant inhibitory form of\nRac1, N17Rac1, was expressed in an immortalized human\nkeratinocyte line (NIK) and N17Rac1 cells were monitored\nfor migration rate and directionality in an applied EF. Ex-\npression of N17Rac1 decreases the rate of migration by 26\nand 46% in the absence and presence of EGF, respectively\n(unpublished data). However, NIK-N17Rac1 cells were un-\nable to sense and respond to the applied EF, even in the\npresence of EGF (Figure 4A). To confirm that Rac1 is essen-\ntial for both \u00024 integrin\u2013 and EGF-mediated directional mi-\ngration in an EF, we preincubated \u00024\u0001 cells in a Rac inhib-\nitor (553502) before monitoring motility and directionality. In\nthe presence of the Rac inhibitor, the speed of \u00024\u0001 cell migra-\ntion is reduced by 24%, whereas the cells are completely\nblinded to the EF and migrated randomly (Figure 4B).\nFigure 5.

For example, expression of a constitutively active\nRac mutant (V12Rac1) can sustain the viability of mammary\ntumors lacking \u00024 integrin (Zahir et al., 2003). We wondered,\ntherefore, if expression of V12Rac1 could rescue the direc-\ntional migratory defect of the \u00024\u0002 cells. There is no signif-\nicant difference in the rate of migration of \u00024\u0002 and \u00024-\nV12Rac1 cells (unpublished data). Although the V12Rac1\ncells exhibit partial EF-mediated directional migration in the\npresence of EGF (35%), the constitutively active Rac mutant\nis not sufficient to compensate for absence of the \u00024 integrin\n(Figure 5).\nActivated Rac1 Fully Restores \u00014 Integrin\u2013mediated\nKeratinocyte Directional Migration in the Absence of\nLaminin 332 Ligation\nAlthough the activate Rac1 mutant was unable to restore\ndirectional migration in cells lacking \u00024 integrin, we won-\ndered if it could compensate for the lack of laminin 332\u2013\nmediated ligation in cells expressing a functional cytoplas-\nmic tail (\u00024\u0001AD). \u00024\u0001AD cells have a truncated Rac1\nactivation profile, similar to \u00024\u0002 cells and fail to sustain\nlamellipodial induction beyond 20 min (Russell et al., 2003).\nThe expression of the active Rac1 mutant has no effect on\nmigration rate in both the presence and absence of EGF\n(unpublished data); however, \u00024\u0001AD cells are now able to\nfully respond to an applied EF. Indeed, they exhibit a robust\ndirectional response in the presence of EGF, and in its ab-\nsence they are indistinguishable from \u00024\u0001 cells (Figure 6).\nDISCUSSION\nThe signaling pathways that initiate and maintain cell po-\nlarity are of fundamental importance in directional cell mi-\ngration. In this study, we establish a novel role for the \u00016\u00024\nintegrin for regulating cell polarity and maintaining direc-\ntional migration in response to the cueing signal provided\nby an applied DC electric field. We demonstrate that al-\nthough the expression of \u00024 integrin appears to have no\neffect on the rate of keratinocyte migration, it is essential for\nEF-mediated directional migration in the absence of EGF. In\nthe presence of EGF, the signaling pathway initiated by \u00024\nintegrin ligand\u2013binding converges with that of EGF receptor\nactivation to initiate and maintain robust, persistent direc-\ntional (cathodal) migration. Adhesion to laminin 332 and a\nfunctional cytoplasmic domain are both required for the \u00024\nintegrin\u2013mediated directional migratory response, and Rac1\nactivation is a required downstream element for both \u00024\nintegrin\u2013 and EGF-mediated cathodal directional migration\n(Figure 7). We believe that this is the first description of a\nrole for \u00024 integrin in sensing and responding to an EF-\nmediated directional signal.\nKeratinocytes express two integrin receptors for laminin\n332, \u00016\u00024 (Sonnenberg et al., 1991) and \u00013\u00021 (Carter et al.,\n1991). Previously, there have been reports of both laminin\n332\u2013mediated inhibition (Miyamoto et al., 1996; O\u2019Toole et\nal., 1997; Goldfinger et al., 1999) and promotion (Carter et al.,\n1991; Zhang and Kramer, 1996; Shang et al., 2001; Raymond\net al., 2005) of keratinocyte migration. Wound edge keratin-\nocytes secrete abundant laminin 332 as they migrate into the\nwound, which is thought to facilitate and promote \u00013\u00021-\nmediated migration and form the foundation of a new base-\nment membrane during reepithelialization (Goldfinger et al.,\n1999; Nguyen et al., 2000a, 2000b). Indeed the closure of\nwounded keratinocyte monolayers requires only \u00013\u00021 inter-\naction with laminin 332 (Lampe et al., 1998; Goldfinger et al.,\n1999; Nguyen et al., 2000a, 2000b). We observe no alteration\nin the rate of keratinocyte migration in the absence of \u00024\nintegrin, suggesting that laminin-5\u2013dependent keratinocyte\nmigration is occurring exclusively via \u00013\u00021 in our system.\nPreviously, we have demonstrated that EGF enhances\nboth keratinocyte motility and EF-mediated directional mi-\ngration (Fang et al., 1998), as we also demonstrate here.\nHowever, the current studies reveal a novel and absolute\nrequirement for the coordinated action of both EGF and \u00024\nintegrin to initiate and maintain robust EF-mediated direc-\ntional migration. It is known that EGFR and \u00016\u00024 integrin\ncross-talk. \u00016\u00024 integrin can physically interact with a num-\nber of receptor tyrosine kinases including the EGFR, ErbB-2,\nRon, and Met (Falcioni et al., 1997; Hintermann et al., 2001;\nMariotti et al., 2001; Trusolino et al., 2001), and EGF induces\ntyrosine phosphorylation of the \u00024 integrin cytoplasmic tail,\nwhich has been implicated in hemidesmosome disassembly\nand epithelial motility (Mainiero et al., 1996). Additionally,\nintegrin adhesion can result in the phosphorylation of the\nEGFR on numerous tyrosine residues (Moro et al., 2002) and\ncan potentiate signaling pathways in response to EGF,\nPDGF, FGF, VEGF, and insulin (reviewed by (Schwartz and\nBaron, 1999). A considerable amount of evidence supports a\nrole for integrin-mediated adhesion in coordinating growth-\nfactor\u2013mediated responses (reviewed by Cabodi et al., 2004).\nIntegrin-mediated signaling is required for EGF-dependent\nproliferation, survival, and migration, demonstrating that a\ncooperative interaction is necessary to achieve full biological\nresponses (Cabodi et al., 2004). It appears that \u00016\u00024 integrin\nand EGF also cooperate to support robust keratinocyte di-\nrectional migration in response to an applied EF cue.\n\u00024 integrin has been demonstrated to localize to lamelli-\npodia and filopodia of migrating carcinoma cells and asso-\nciate with F-actin (Rabinovitz and Mercurio, 1997). Indeed,\ninhibition of \u00016\u00024 function resulted in the collapse of\nlamellipodia and filopodia (Rabinovitz and Mercurio,\n1997; Rabinovitz et al., 1999). \u00016\u00024 has also been localized\nto actin-containing structures in keratinocytes (Geuijen\nand Sonnenberg, 2002; Santoro et al., 2003; Spinardi et al.,\n2004), but we observe its presence in fine linear structures\nat the leading edge, suggesting that in migrating keratino-\nFigure 7. A diagrammatic illustration is shown outlining the syn-\nergistic pathways required for keratinocyte EF-mediated directional\nmigration.\nC. E. Pullar et al.\nMolecular Biology of the Cell4932\ncytes, \u00024 integrin becomes incorporated within focal adhesion\nsites, centers for traction control (Ridley et al., 2003).\nThe cytoplasmic tail of \u00024 integrin is unique with no\nknown homology to other \u0002 subunits. It is unusually long\n(\u00071000 amino acids), associates with the hemidesmosome\ncytoskeleton (Sonnenberg et al., 1991) via HD 1\/plectin\n(Nievers et al., 2000) and contains a tyrosine activation motif\n(TAM) that can facilitate the docking of src homology 2\n(SH2) domains while phosphorylated. In primary keratino-\ncytes both Shc and Grb2 are recruited to the \u00024 integrin\u2013\nphosphorylated TAM sequentially activating MAP kinase\npathways and promoting proliferation (Mainiero et al., 1995,\n1997). Furthermore, \u00016\u00024 can activate phosphoinositide\n3-kinase (PI3-K), increasing the invasive capacity of breast\nand colon carcinoma cells (Shaw et al., 1997).\nThe loss of the \u00024 integrin cytoplasmic tail has a negative\neffect on the ability of the cells to sense and respond to the\napplied EF in the absence of EGF. \u00024\u0001CT-expressing cells\nare blinded to the applied EF and migrate randomly, remi-\nniscent of \u00024\u0001AD cells. It appears that a fully functional \u00024\nintegrin ligand-binding domain and a fully functional \u00024\nintegrin cytoplasmic tail are both required in order for ker-\natinocytes to respond to an applied EF in the absence of EGF\nand respond robustly in the presence of EGF. This suggests\nthat in the absence of EGF, ligation of \u00024 integrin by laminin\n332 transmits a signal via its cytoplasmic tail to initiate and\nrespond to an applied EF, allowing the cell to form a new\nlamellipodium facing the cathode, turn, and migrate direc-\ntionally.\nThe ability of a cell to respond to an applied EF requires\nthe formation of a new lamellipodium facing the cathode.\nRac1 plays a role in lamellipodial formation (Hall, 1998) and\nexpression of a constitutively active Rac1 mutant accelerates\ncutaneous wound repair (Hassanain et al., 2005). Previously,\nit has been demonstrated that \u00024 integrin can activate the\nPI3 kinase signaling pathway (Shaw et al., 1997; Gambaletta\net al., 2000; Shaw, 2001) resulting in Rac1 activation (Shaw et\nal., 1997). Our studies highlight Rac1 as a critical conver-\ngence point and pivotal regulator of both \u00024 integrin\u2013 and\nEGF-mediated keratinocyte galvanotaxis, coordinating the\nsignals to allow cells to migrate directionally in response to\nthe applied EF. Although the expression of a dominant\nnegative Rac1 mutant or the application of a specific Rac\ninhibitor slows keratinocyte migration, it prevents galvano-\ntaxis in both the presence and absence of EGF. Importantly,\nwe demonstrate that \u00024 integrin expression is essential for\nkeratinocytes to sense and respond to an EF with robust\ndirectional migration, because a constitutively active Rac1\nmutant cannot restore directional migration in cells lacking\n\u00024 integrin expression. Meanwhile, expression of the consti-\ntutively active Rac1 mutant in cells expressing adhesion-\ndefective \u00024 integrin has no effect on migration rate but fully\nrestores keratinocyte galvanotaxis. It has been suggested\nthat while growth factors can activate Rac globally within\nthe cell, integrins determine the specific locality where Rac\nwill bind to its effectors, thus determining where to extend\nlamellipodia, facilitating directional migration (Del Pozo et\nal., 2002; Grande-Garcia et al., 2005). Although lamellipodial\nformation is absent in Rac1 genetic null cells (Vidali et al.,\n2006), a partial, rather than total, decrease in levels can\nactually increase persistent directional motility by suppress-\ning peripheral and sustaining dominant lamellipodial for-\nmation (Pankov et al., 2005). Indeed, here it appears that \u00024\nintegrin coordinates with EGF to localize Rac1 activation to\nthe dominant lamellipodium, initiate and maintain Rac1-\ndependent persistent directional migration in response to EF\ncueing.\nIn conclusion, we describe a role for \u00016\u00024 integrin in\nsustaining directional migration in keratinocytes in response\nto an applied EF and demonstrate that the cooperative in-\nteraction of both EGF and \u00024 integrin is necessary to achieve\nthe full biological response of EF-mediated directional mi-\ngration. Rac1 is critical for both EGF-mediated and \u00024 inte-\ngrin\u2013mediated keratinocyte directional migration in an ap-\nplied EF as well as in EGF-driven chemotaxis (Russell et al.,\n2003). Perhaps underpinning the role of \u00024 integrin in di-\nrectional migration is its ability to regulate cell turning or\nmediate stabilization of the site at which the new lamellipo-\ndium will form to allow migration in the direction of the\napplied gradient. Studying EF-induced directional migra-\ntion will improve our understanding of directional sensing\nand the signaling mechanisms required for these biological\nprocesses that play important roles in embryonic develop-\nment, inflammation, tumor metastasis, and wound repair.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by the VA Palo Alto Office of Research and\nDevelopment (M.P.M.) and National Institutes of Health Grants K01-AR48827\n(C.E.P.), P01-AR44012 and R01-AR47223 (M.P.M.), and R01-AR44518 (R.R.I.).\nREFERENCES\nBarker, A.
