With the support of the Editorial Board and ALT\u2019s\nnew Director of Development, Mark van Harmelen and Publications Officer, Louise Ryan,\nwe have a great opportunity to build on the many strengths introduced at ALT-J by the previ-\nous editors. My first venture was to commission a special issue on Learning and Teaching\nin Immersive Virtual Worlds, with Maggi Savin-Baden and Robert Ward as co-editors.\nProjects in immersive virtual worlds were proliferating, raising questions about the oppor-\ntunities for learning offered by these new spaces, and how students and academics would\nrespond to them. There was a place for the publication of early findings, and theories to\nguide and inform ongoing research. Are immersive virtual worlds \u2018disruptive technologies\u2019\n(Bower and Christensen 1995)1 in education? To answer this question, we need to pay close\nattention to their use in new applications, rather than in re-creations of traditional learning\nactivities online.\nFrances Bell\nUniversity of Salford, UK\nLearning and teaching in Immersive Virtual Worlds\nThis special issue comprises a number of exciting initiatives and developments that begin\nto put issues of learning in immersive virtual worlds centre stage. Although learning through\nspecific types of serious games has been popular for some years, the pedagogical value of\nimmersive worlds is currently not only inchoate but also under-researched. Whilst several\nof the articles here are not based on empirical research, what they do offer is new ways of\nconsidering the pedagogical purposes of using these kinds of digital spaces. The difficulty\nwith the perception of immersive virtual worlds is that there is often a sense that they are\nseen as being dislocated from physical spaces, and yet they are not. Web spaces are largely\nviewed as necessarily freer locations where there is a sense that it is both possible and desir-\nable to \u2018do things differently\u2019. The consequence is that digital pedagogies tend to be, or at\nleast feel, less ordered than much of face-to-face learning, forcing a reconsideration of how\nlearning spaces in digital contexts are to be constituted (for further discussion on this see\nSavin-Baden 2007). Immersive virtual worlds demand that we confront the possibility of\nnew types of visuality, literacy, pedagogy, representations of knowledge, communication\nand embodiment. Thus, as Pelletier has argued, \u201ctechnologies are systems of cultural trans-\nmission, creating new contexts within which existing social interests express themselves\u201d\n(2005, 12). Yet there remain conflicts about whether \u201cpedagogy must lead the technology\u201d,\n138  Editorial\na stance Cousin (2005) believes has become something of a mantra. Although this position\nwould seem plausible and convincing to adopt, it denies the difficulties inherent in putting\ntechnology in the lead. It seems that many of the difficulties about the reflexive relationship\nbetween pedagogy and technology stem from a failure to ask what might appear to be some\nstraightforward questions, such as: \n\u25cf What do we mean by pedagogy in immersive virtual worlds?\n\u25cf For what is the learning technology to be used?\n\u25cf Is it learning technology, teaching technology, technology to enhance teaching and\nlearning, or something else?\n\u25cf What is the relationship between the type of pedagogy to be adopted and the type of\npedagogy currently being used?\nCousin (2005) also points out that technology is not just lying there waiting for pedagogues\nto put to good use \u2013 but it might be that that is how some innovators see the situation.\nKnowledge to go, knowledge on the move is embodied by open source systems and in\nparticular Web 2.0 technologies, with their emphasis on user-generated content. Yet what\nremains problematic is students\u2019 engagement with immersive worlds: there seems to be a\nmarked contrast between how such spaces are used by students within the university and\nwhat they do outside formal learning environments. We hope that through this special issue\nsome of the queries and questions raised here will promote engagement in ongoing debates\nthat begin to move forward both the arguments and practices, in interesting and innovative\nways.\nMaggi Savin-Baden\nDirector, Learning Innovation, University of Coventry, UK\nRobert Ward\nUniversity of Huddersfield, UK\nNote\n1.
