At any time, one of the two units is\noperating while the other is on cold standby. The repairman may not always at the\njob site, or take vacation. We assume that shocks can attack the operating unit. The\narrival times of the shocks follow a homogeneous Poisson process and their magni-\ntude is a random variable following a known distribution.

The main interest of existing research\n1 College of Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China. Corresponding author.E-\nmail: wuqingtai@njau.edu.cn.\n2 School of Applied Sciences, Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedfordshire MK43 0AL, United Kingdom\nfocuses on one-unit systems with Poisson shocks under the assumption that the damage to the\nsystem resulted from a single shock can be neglected, and the system fails once the damage has\naccumulated to a certain level. For example, Shamthikumar and Sumita studied the earthquake\nand inventory problems and introduced a shock model, in which the system fails when the magni-\ntude of a shock exceeds a pre-specified threshold [2,3]. Li et al. studied complex systems consisting\nof n i.i.d. units with a \u03b4-shock model [4].\nStandby systems have attracted the attention of many researchers. There are three main types\nof redundant standby systems: cold, warm and hot. Cold standby systems have been studied\nextensively in the past. For example, [5,6] have investigated two-unit standby system models\nand assumed that the standby unit is immediately switched on once the operating unit fails,\nwhereas Gupta and Kishan [7] assume that the standby unit is not immediately switched before\na fixed preparation time is took to put standby into service. Recently, the reliability indices of\ncold standby repairable systems have been derived when the times between repairs are assumed\nto follow the geometric process [8,9]. Meanwhile, Mahmoud and Moshrefa [10] deal with the study\nof the stochastic analysis of a two-unit cold standby system considering hardware failure, human\nerror failure and preventive maintenance.\nIn the research mentioned above, a unit is repaired immediately after it fails, which might not be\nthe case in practice: in most real scenarios, a failed unit might not be repaired immediately due to\nvarious reasons. One of the problems often occurred, for example, is the absence of maintenance\nstaff. This happens in median or small firms as they might not be able to afford to recruit a\nfull-time repairman looking after their equipment. Instead, a repairman might need to care many\ntypes of equipments and he might not be able to repair a failed unit immediately once it fails.\nWe say that the repairman is on vacation if he is absent when an unit fails, although he might\nactually be repairing other equipment.\nDoshi [11] provides a comprehensive survey on vacation system models, and Ke and Wang [12]\ninvestigated a machine repair problem with two vacation policies (single vacation and multiple\n2\nvacations), both of which were based on a queuing theory viewpoint. Su and Shi [13] discussed\nthe reliability of a n-unit series system in which the repairman takes multiple vacations. Jia and\nWu [14] studied a replacement policy for a repairable system with its repairman taking multiple\nvacations. Jia and Wu [15] develop replacement policy for a cold standby system composed of two\nidentical units with perfect switching.\nThe reliability indices of a two-unit cold standby repairable systems are important to industries.\nAnalysing and deriving such indices for the systems impacted by shocks can be more interesting\nas shocks occur from time to time in the real world. This motivates us to analyse the reliability\nof a two-unit cold standby repairable system. We assume the system might be attacked by shocks\nfollowing a Poisson process. It should be noted such analysis is not an easy task when the survivor\ndistribution and the distribution of the vacation period of the repairman are general distributions.\nIn this paper, we introduce a supplementary variable when solving the partial differential equations\nused to describe the dynamics between state transitions. With the help of the ergodicity of the\ninvestigated process and the theory of the first-order, linear, ordinary differential equations, we\nobtain explicit expressions of reliability indices such as steady-state availabilities and steady state\nfailure frequency.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the system and lists assumptions. Section 3\nderives integro-differential equations. In section 4, we transform the integro-differential equations\ninto the first-order, linear, ordinary differential equations, and obtain the explicit solution of the\nequations. Explicit expressions for reliability indices for the system are derived. Section 5 presents\na special case (model) without vacation. Section 6 offers numerical examples. Concluding remarks\nare offered in the last section.\n3\n2 Model assumptions\nAssume that the system under discussion is a cold standby repairable system. A part-time re-\npairman looks after the system that might be attacked by shocks. The following assumptions\nhold.\nA1. The system consists of two different units (ie, unit 1 and unit 2), a switch and a repairman.\nThe two units are operating alternatively: one unit is operating while the other is on cold\nstandby or is being repaired if it has failed. The standby unit will be switched to the operating\nstate once the operating unit fails, the switch is perfect.\nA2. The system subjects to shocks. The arrivals of the shocks follow a Poisson process {N(t), t\u22650}\nwith the intensity \u03bb > 0. The magnitude of each shock, X\u0302, is an independent random variable\nwith distribution function F .\nA3. When a shock arrives, it only affects the operating unit. The operating unit will fail when\nthe magnitude of a shock exceeds a threshold. The threshold of unit i is a non-negative random\nvariable \u03c4i with a distribution function \u03a6i, (i = 1, 2).\nA4. When a unit fails with the presence of the repairman, it will be repaired immediately. Once\nthe failed unit is repaired, the repairman leaves for a time period (maybe for other tasks), or\nis said to take a vacation. The repair rule is \u201dfirst-in-first-out\u201d. If a unit fails when the other is\nbeing repaired, the newly failed unit must wait for repair and the system is down. If two units\nare waiting for repair when the repairman returns from a vacation, unit 1 has the priority to be\nrepaired 3 . If there are no failed unit when the repairman returns from a vacation, he does not\ntake a vacation again and remains idle until the first failed unit appears.\nDenote Yi (i=1, 2) as unit i\u2019s repair time, and Z as the vacation length of the repairman\ndenoted. Their distributions are: Hi(t) =\n\u222b t\n0 hi(x)dx = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\n\u222b t\n0\n\u00b5i(x)dx, V (t) =\n\u222b t\n0 v(x)dx =\n3 This is a realistic assumption as the repairman, upon his return from vacation, might pick up one of\nthe failed units to repair and it is not important for him to select which unit \u2014 it can be either unit 1\nor unit 2.\n4\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\n\u222b t\n0\n\u03b1(x)dx, respectively. We also denote E(Z) = 1\n\u03b1\n, V\u00af (t) = 1 \u2212 V (t), E(Yi) = 1\u00b5i , Hi(t) =\n1\u2212Hi(t)(i = 1, 2).\nA5. Shocks are assumed to be the only cause of unit failure, and the system fails only if both the\nunits fail.\nA6. All random variables are independent. At the beginning, the two units are new, unit 1 starts\nto work, unit 2 is on cold standby, and the repairman takes vacation. The units can be repaired\n\u201das good as new\u201d.\n3 Model development\nWith the model assumptions given in the preceding section, the failure probability of unit i, given\nthe shock value x\u0302, is \u03a6i(x\u0302) = P (\u03c4i \u2264 x\u0302). Since the magnitude of a shock is a random variable X\u0302,\nthe conditional failure probability of unit i is a random variable \u03a6i(X\u0302) with i = 1, 2, respectively,\nand their probability distribution can be written by: Pi(x) = P (\u03a6i(X\u0302) \u2264 x) = P (X\u0302 \u2264 \u03a6\u22121i (x)) =\nF (\u03a6\u22121i (x)), 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, (i = 1, 2).From assumptions A2 and A3, we can see that, the probability\nthat one shock causes unit i to fail is:\nri = P (X\u0302 > \u03c4i) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nP (\u03c4i < x\u0302|X\u0302 = x\u0302)dP (X\u0302 \u2264 x\u0302) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u03a6i(x\u0302)dF (x\u0302), (i = 1, 2).\nLet S(t) be the system state at time t, then\nstate 0: at time t, unit 1 is operating, unit 2 is on cold standby, and the repairman is taking a\nvacation.\nstate 1: at time t, unit 2 is operating, unit 1 is on cold standby, and the repairman is taking a\nvacation.\nstate 2: at time t, unit 2 is operating, unit 1 is waiting for repair, and the repairman is taking\na vacation.\nstate 3: at time t, unit 1 is operating, unit 2 is waiting for repair, and the repairman is taking\n5\na vacation.\nstate 4: at time t, two units are waiting for repair, and the repairman is taking a vacation.\nstate 5: at time t, unit 1 is operating, unit 2 is on cold standby, and the repairman is idle.\nstate 6: at time t, unit 2 is operating, unit 1 is on cold standby, and the repairman is idle.\nstate 7: at time t, unit 2 is operating, unit 1 is being repaired.\nstate 8: at time t, unit 1 is operating, unit 2 is being repaired.\nstate 9: at time t, unit 1 is being repaired, unit 2 is waiting for being repaired.\nstate 10: at time t, unit 2 is being repaired, unit 1 is waiting for being repaired.\nThe state space is \u2126 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, where the operating state set isW = {0, 1, 2, 3, 5,\n6, 7, 8} and the failure state set is F = {4, 9, 10}. As the repair time has a general continuous distri-\nbution, {S(t), t \u2265 0} is not a Markov process. Therefore we introduce the following supplementary\nvariables:\n\u2022 X(t): if S(t) = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Then X(t) is the elapsed vacation time when the repairman is taking\na vacation at time t.\n\u2022 Y1(t): if S(t) = 7, 9. Then Y1(t) is the elapsed repair time of unit 1 being repaired at time t.\n\u2022 Y2(t): if S(t) = 8, 10. Then Y2(t) is the elapsed repair time of unit 2 being repaired at time t.\nThen {(S(t), X(t), Y1(t), Y2(t)), t \u2265 0} is a continuous vector Markov process (see [16]) with the\nfollowing state space:\u2126\u2217 = {[0, x], [1, x], [2, x], [3, x], [4, x], 5, 6, [7, y], [8, z], [9, y], [10, z]}. where x, y\nand z are the realisation values of X(t), Y1(t) and Y2(t), respectively. Denote:\nQi(t, x) = P (S(t) = i,X(t) \u2264 x), (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4),\nQi(t, y) = P (S(t) = i, Y1(t) \u2264 y), (i = 7, 9), Qi(t, z) = P (S(t) = i, Y2(t) \u2264 z), (i = 8, 10)\nwhere P (A) is probability of event A, and denote:\nPi(t, u) =\nd\ndu\nQi(t, u)(i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n6\nthe following relations are valid:\nQi(t,\u221e) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nPi(t, u)du, (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10),\nwhere pi(t) = P (S(t) = i)(i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 10).\nUsing the probability arguments and limiting transitions shown in Appendix, we have the following\nintegro-differential equations:\n(\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202\n\u2202x\n+ ri+1\u03bb+ \u03b1(x)\n)\nPi(t, x) = 0, (i = 0, 1)\n(1)\n(\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n+ \u2202\n\u2202x\n+ r2\u03bb+ \u03b1(x)\n)\nP2(t, x) = r1\u03bbP0(t,

If r1 = r2 = r = 1, then each shock will cause the working unit to fail and the repairman\nwill take vacations;\n12\nCase 3. If r1 = r2 = r = 1, and P (Z = 0) = 1, then each shock will cause the working unit to\nfail and the repairman will repair once the unit fails.\nCorresponding results can be easily obtained for the above special cases.\n6 Numerical examples\nTo validate the above derivation, we conduct the following numerical experiment. Here, we assume\nF (x) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b7x, x > 0;\n0, x \u2264 0;\n,\u03a61(x) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1\u2212 e\u2212 \u03b74x, x > 0;\n0, x \u2264 0;\n,\u03a62(x) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n1\u2212 e\u2212 \u03b73x, x > 0;\n0, x \u2264 0;\n.\nThen we have\nr1 = P (X\u0302 > \u03c41) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nP (\u03c41 < x\u0302|X\u0302 = x\u0302)dP (X\u0302 \u2264 x\u0302) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n(1\u2212 e\u2212 \u03b74 x\u0302)d(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b7x\u0302) = 1\n5\n,\nr2 = P (X\u0302 > \u03c42) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nP (\u03c42 < x\u0302|X\u0302 = x\u0302)dP (X\u0302 \u2264 x\u0302) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n(1\u2212 e\u2212 \u03b73 x\u0302)d(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b7x\u0302) = 1\n4\n,\nWe assume the repair time distribution of the unit i(i=1,2) and the vacation time distribution\nof the repairman are exponential distributions, i.e. hi(t) = \u00b5i exp(\u2212\u00b5it) (i = 1, 2) and v(t) =\n\u03b1 exp(\u2212\u03b1t).\nWe first present numerical examples comparing the reliability indices for the situations when the\nrepairman is assumed to have single vacation and no vacation. Figures 1, 2 and 3 shows the\nsteady-state probability of the repairman vacation and the steady-state probability of wait-for-\nrepair time when a single vacation of the repairman is assumed. From the curves of Figs. 1, 2,\nand 3, we conclude that the steady-state availability A, mean up-time MUT , and mean time to\nthe first failure for the model with single vacation increase uniformly. They increase rapidly at an\nearly stage and then stable as \u03b1 becomes larger. The curves of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 shows that, when\nthe repairman only takes single vacation, both the steady-state probability PV of the length of\nthe vacation and the steady-state probability Pw of system\u2019s waiting-for-repair time decrease as\n13\nthe rate \u03b1 increases. The decrease is rapid initially and then becomes stable as \u03b1 becomes larger.\nFig. 6 shows the steady-state availability increases as \u03b1 increases. It can also be observed from\nFig. 6 that the intensity values \u03bb affect the steady-state availability significantly, the steady-state\navailability decreases as intensity \u03bb increases.\nThe mean up-time MUT and the mean time to the first failure MTTFF are investigated, when\n\u03bb and \u03b1 change, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2. We change the values of \u03bb and \u03b1 and observe\ntheir cross effects on the mean up-time MUT and the mean time. It shows that increasing \u03bb can\nsignificantly decrease the MUT and the MTTFF, however, increasing \u03b1 rarely affects the values\nof MUT and MTTFF.\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n\u03b1\nSt\nea\ndy\n\u2212s\nta\nte\n a\nva\nila\nbi\nlity\n o\nf t\nhe\n s\nys\nte\nm\nmodel with single vacation\nmodel without vacation\nFigure 1.

The repairman might take vacation and the operating unit might\nbe attacked by shocks. Such a system can be seen as an extension of a general cold standby\nrepairable system, which is one of important repaired systems in the reliability engineering and is\nalso difficult to analyse as there are many random variables with general distributions involved.\nThe numerical data experiments show the relationship between the derived reliability indices and\nrelevant parameters.\nIn this paper, it is also assumed that if there is no failed unit when the repairman returns from\na vacation, he does not take a vacation again and remain idle until the first failed unit appears.\nThis assumption will be relaxed in our future work.\n17\nAppendix\nThe derivation of Eqs. (1) \u223c (12)\nSince the process{(S(t), X(t), Y1(t), Y2(t)), t \u2265 0} is a continuous vector Markov process, we can\nexpress the process in a way considering the transitions occurring in t and t + \u2206t.
