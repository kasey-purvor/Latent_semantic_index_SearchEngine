A. Longstaffe, P. J. Williams, K. D. Whittlestone, P. M. Hammond and J. Edwards\nEducational Technology Service, University of Bristol\nThis paper covers some of the issues associated with the support of learning technology within an\ninstitution. It describes the activities of a working support service, and highlights approaches to some of\nthe academic, technological, political and management issues that have helped it perform effectively over\na four-year period.\nIntroduction\nOver the past decade it has become increasingly apparent that computer technology is\nextremely effective in the support of teaching and learning. It has also become obvious that\nwithout proselytization and support, the adoption of this new method of teaching is patchy and\nfrequently inappropriate. The raising of awareness, the training of staff and the provision of\ninformed advice and support are necessary to facilitate the appropriate development of\ntechnology-supported learning within an institution.\nThe support paradigm which has emerged so far has two parts. The first consists of national\ndiscipline-based centres. These exist mainly within the Computers in Teaching Initiative (CTT)\nnetwork and possess specialist subject knowledge as well as a knowledge of good practice\nwithin the academic field in question. Although personnel in the CTI centres have an ideal\nconstellation of the necessary skills and knowledge, they are not available to academic staff in\nan individual institution on a day-to-day basis. There is therefore a need for local institutional\nsupport complementary to that supplied by national centres.\nJonathan Darby, in his comprehensive picture of UK learning technology in 1992 (Darby,\n1992) refers to the fact that although a number of universities have developed their own CBL\n(Computer-Based Learning) units, with a few notable exceptions these are often limited in\nscope and frequently concentrated solely on IT skills. The University of Bristol has drawn on\nthe early experience of units such as the Institute for Computer Based Learning (ICBL) at\nHeriot-Watt University, but has also looked closely at the experience and needs of individual\nacademics as gathered by the staff of the CTI Centre for Medicine since its inception in 1989.\n85\nJ. A bongstaffe et al Establishing a support service for educational technology within a university\nThis paper seeks to encapsulate some of the structures, strategies and experiences which have\narisen from the first four years of activity in a relatively modestly funded university-based\neducational technology service.\nStructure and activities\nIn order to achieve its remit of 'promoting and supporting the appropriate use of technology in\nteaching and learning', the Educational Technology Service (ETS) of the University of Bristol\nundertakes three categories of activity, namely service, focused and academic.\nService activities raise awareness and inform client staff by means of a newsletter, an\nelectronic mail list, a seminar programme, open days and a comprehensive advice service\nwhich includes technology, instructional design, project design and management, proposal\nconstruction and the use of global networks such as the Internet (Browning and Williams,\n1995).\nFocused activities consist of support for a number of defined learning projects each year. This\nhas included evaluation of learning needs, acquisition of learning software and resources, and\nthe production of learning material by University staff and its integration into the curriculum.\nThese projects are carried out in collaboration with individual departments and are aimed at\nproducing a measurable change in the quality and efficiency of a particular course or module.\nProductivity tools such as authoring templates for the production of interactive learning\nmaterial and software for image digitization, storage and manipulation are developed to\nsupport these activities.\nAcademic activities cover the normal range of research and publication. These projects serve\nto expand the range of staff and expertise available to the University, and many form\ncollaborations with other institutions.\nAcademic issues\nOver the four years of the existence of the ETS, a number of issues and strategies have proved\nimportant. This paper concentrates on a few of the more significant ones; others are discussed\nin Longstaffe et al (1995).\nIn terms of academic issues, it is important to understand some aspects of the culture and the\npeople involved in higher education before considering some of the approaches that it might be\nuseful to adopt. There are three major factors in the university environment that must be taken\ninto account when supporting learning technology. These are described here as individualism,\nteaching paranoia and time pressure.\nIndividualism\nMost teachers in universities have grown up in a tradition which involves the preparation of a\nhighly personal course, with much reference to printed material, but little to academic\ncolleagues. Learning technology does not generally lend itself to such an individual approach.\nIt is more effective when produced by teams or consortia which are likely to possess the mix of\nskills necessary. A collaborative attitude to the production of learning materials needs to be\nfostered by the staff of a support service. Locally, this has not only had the effect of generating\n86\nALT-J Volume 4 Number I\nbetter-quality materials than in projects driven by individuals, but has also made materials\nmore generally acceptable. The advantages of the team approach are further supported by\nDuguid (1995).\nTeaching paranoia\nUniversity teachers often have little or no formal training in teaching or educational theory.\nMost academics are aware of this and, as a result, are not unnaturally reluctant to expose\nthemselves by preparing material which will be more public than their usual lecture or tutorial.\nIt is necessary to provide sympathetic and constructive support which will include tactful\ntraining in aspects of instructional design, course design, evaluation and so on. It is becoming\napparent to the authors of this paper that as teachers become involved in the production of\nmaterials of this sort, their criticism of similar work becomes more constructive.\nTime pressure\nThe entire university culture is under pressure from reductions in funding, increased student\nnumbers and administrative load. This is not an easy environment in which to expect the\ninvestment of large amounts of staff time. Fortunately, there are always enthusiasts willing to\ncommit quite unreasonable amounts of time to projects. Tactful direction and support of these\nenthusiasts has produced good results locally. In addition, strategies such as the use of\nsabbaticals and the student production of computer-aided learning have worked extremely well\nin individual cases. Student production of CAL is a regular feature of the veterinary anatomy\ncurriculum at Bristol, and has produced a measurable increase in performance in conventional\nexaminations (Garvin and Carrington, 1995).\nDiffering levels of staff expertise\nIt is important to remember that no university academic population is uniform with respect to\nexpertise in learning technology. We find that our 'clients' divide into sophisticated,\nknowledgeable and naive groups. In 1991, a small cadre of sophisticated staff were already\nproducing and delivering material with a degree of expertise. Support targeted to this group has\nbeen specialized, such as help with image recording and manipulation, CD pressing and the\ndigitization of video. With good contacts, it has also been possible to help the departments in\nquestion with locating, interviewing and appointing staff appropriate to particular jobs.\nA larger and growing group comprises those who are knowledgeable about CAL and who are\nengaged in its production or at least sufficiently motivated to begin doing so. We have found\nthat this is the most important group to target, and the one which has produced the most results\nper unit-effort.\nUnderstandably, the majority of teaching staff can still be termed naive with respect to learning\ntechnology, although they may have a range of IT literacy. The ETS has raised awareness with\na departmental seminar programme on the basics of CAL backed up with printed and\nelectronic information, workshops and demonstrations. Visits from relevant CTI centres have\ncreated a very useful start with several departments. Once a naive department starts to move\ntowards the knowledgeable, assistance with the formation of CAL committees, the planning\nand design of learning projects and the construction of effective grant proposals have also been\nshown to be successful strategies.\n87\nJ. A Longstaffe et ol Establishing a support service for educational technology within a university\nTechnological strategies\nThese strategies are not so much about the technology itself, but constitute ways of coping\nwith the technology. It is important, for instance, to be able to advise on how close to stay to\nthe technological cutting edge: too close, and a project can get bogged down in bugs and\nincompatibilities; too far away, and opportunities can be lost. Guidelines can be broken in both\ndirections, but it is important to have them first. A second technological strategy is to try to\navoid the 'high-tech fascination' that seems to lure many enthusiasts into committing too much\nenergy to ultra-sophisticated prototypes which never see the light of day. The 'keep it simple'\napproach is vital.\nAnother observed problem is the failure of clients to understand, or technologists to\ncommunicate, the nature of the software development cycle. Any piece of developing software\nmust undergo numbers of iterations between producers and computer-tolerant users before it\nbecomes effective. This is often extremely time-consuming for the users, who must be briefed\naccordingly. Too often, projects have been seen to under-achieve because of unreasonable\npromises on the one hand and unreasonable expectations on the other. Other technological\nstrategies include coping with conflicting delivery platforms, keeping data separate from\nauthoring structures, and finding ways of coping with the moving technological goal posts.\nPolitical and management issues\nWays to relate to university senior management and to complementary units such as computing\nservices and libraries must be devised, and the political and financial location of the service\nestablished. The location of the ETS within a school of education has been successful both in\nterms of available expertise and credibility.\nOne important concept to bear in mind is that of the 'multiplier effect'. The focused training\nand support of a relatively small group of individuals will create a growing body of expertise\nand models of good practice which in turn support and inspire others. Our own dental school\nhas progressed in this way over five years from a single enthusiast to the replacement of 98\nhours of the undergraduate syllabus by CAL materials. The Bristol Dental School is now\nregarded as a national leader in the field.\nA service of this type must also manage itself in a highly conscious and flexible manner. Most\nof its activities will not have been performed before, and it is vital that reviews of policy and\ndirection are frequent and effective. The ETS has developed a set of activities which are\ndesigned to effect its mission statement. These activities form a team job description which\ndevolves into individual job descriptions. All activities are subject to an annual review which is\ninformed by monthly brainstorming sessions. These focus on a particular aspect of service-\nfunction or client-need.\nQuality and value for money are important measurements for senior management to use in\nforming opinions about the optimal placement of funding. In order to achieve some sort of\nmeasurability, we return to the purpose which attaches to each group of activities, and then\ncheck to see how well those purposes are being met. Parameters such as departments\nproducing CAL, departments delivering CAL, student contact hours and staff time saved are\nuseful quantity indicators. Quality can be judged by staff and student feedback and assistance\nwith rapid evaluation protocols (Edwards, 1995).\n88\nALT-] Volume 4 Number I\nOrganizational models for institutional and departmental support\nWithin the university\nThe ETS, based academically and politically within the School of Education, relates closely on\na day-to-day basis to the Computing Service, Staff Development, the Library, the School of\nEducation and other units such as Audiovisual Services and the Centre for Video Publishing.\nStaff training activities have, as a result, become virtually seamless, with staff from all units\nworking in a collaborative fashion. With this sort of interdepartmental co-operation, it is\nbecoming easier to identify training needs and satisfy them using knowledge and expertise\nlocated in the various units.\nWe have compared our activities and approach with other universities, notably Aberdeen,\nHeriot-Watt, Nottingham and Southampton. It is refreshing to note that, in general, they are\ngrappling with similar problems in much the same way. Staff awareness, training and advice\nare dealt with in a 'service' manner with the production, acquisition, evaluation and integration\nof learning material being supported on a project basis.\nComparing our own approach to the complex relationships between academic and\ntechnological support units with those of other universities, it has become obvious that while a\nnumber of intra-university organizational models exist (ranging from the discipline-based\ninitiatives at the University of Aberdeen to the more institutional-based approaches of\nNottingham, Heriot-Watt and Southampton), the problems, strategies and solutions remain\nvery similar. The key element seems to the effectiveness of collaboration and awareness\nbetween units rather than any single organizational model.\nRelationship to national initiatives\nThe most significant and useful initiative in terms of the needs of the ETS and its client\nacademics is the the discipline-based CTI network. The ability to call in a CTT centre with its\ndiscipline-based expertise, its networking and its knowledge of relevant materials expands the\nability of a local service to create a positive effect in its community. A CTI visit to a relevant\ndepartment has on several occasions been the trigger which has led to its serious involvement\nin learning technology. ETS staff have contributed to such visits, assuring personnel of the\nongoing support and activities available locally.\n (\nIn addition to the CTI, the development of the TLTP regional centres, as well as initiatives\nsuch as the Scottish Learning Technology Development Initiative (LTDI), clearly have a\nfurther positive effect. Provided that proper liaison is established between national and local\ninitiatives, the synergy developed can only help with the enormous task of effecting the\ncultural change within higher education which is so necessary to its future.\nIntegration of the work of the service with individuals and departments\nThe section above deals with the relationship between the ETS and other learning-support units\nwithin the institution. Turning to the ways in which at the grass roots the ETS integrates its\nwork with individual academics and departments, some of our experiences may be useful.\nWith respect to focused or departmental projects, we have found academic ownership of the\nproject to be essential. With assistance in project management, our most successful projects (in\nthe Department of Professional Legal Studies, in dentistry and in veterinary anatomy, for\n89\nJ. A Longstaffe et o\\ Establishing a support service for educational technology within a university\ninstance) have been clearly owned and driven by academics within the departments. On the\ndown side, this has sometimes led to isolationism by departments, and unwillingness to involve\nETS staff other than as service providers. This, in turn, has led to the consequent reinvention of\nsome wheels.\nSupport and enthusiasm from a departmental head is an extremely powerful factor in the\nsuccess of learning projects, even if this person is not directly involved. Conversely, negativity\nfrom senior personnel has led to loss of morale and momentum in some cases. One example of\nacademic staff 'directed' to produce CAL material led to many delays in the production of that\nmaterial, extra work for ETS staff, reluctant communications and severe delays in\nimplementation.\nAnother stimulus for successful projects has been the award, by the University, of a number of\ngrants totalling \u00a3100,000 per annum to departments for the development of 'excellence and\ninnovation in teaching and learning'. The participation of the ETS in, first the structuring of\nproposals for this money and subsequently support for successful projects, has had a strong\ninfluence on both the high proportion of money awarded for technology-based solutions and\nthe ultimate success of these projects.\nAnother stratagem is diat of constant personal contact and encouragement. Many busy\nacademics, left to their own devices, will procrastinate, delaying a CAL project to a severe\ndegree. Gentle support, follow-ups, reminders and offers of help mean that project\ndevelopment stays high on personal agendas, making sure that academic time is made\navailable within a reasonable timetable.\nFinally, one of our most successful strategies has been to produce a simple template associated\nwith one of the commercial authoring systems (Asymetrix ToolBook. We support this with\none-day introductory and follow-up seminars. This template has now been used to produce\nsome hundreds of tutorials in use with students in disciplines as separate as dentistry, anatomy,\nlaw and modern languages.\nEvaluation of the impact of the service\nThis has not been an easy task. Because it is essential that academic departments have\nownership of the various learning projects, it is difficult to apportion credit between the\nsupport service and the client department. In the early years, the impact can be measured, as in\nFigure 1, by demand indicated by numbers of departments advised or trained. Another useful\nmeasurement in the early stages is departmental involvement in the production and delivery of\ntechnology-based learning materials.\nWe have more recently introduced such parameters as student contact hours and staff time\nsaved. It is our experience that these measurements need to be planned for in advance: it does\nnot usually occur to staff responsible for the development and delivery of learning material diat\nthe measurements could be important. The ETS is also assisting departments to evaluate their\nown and imported materials incorporating student feedback and attitudes. At this stage, most of\ndie evaluations are informal, with lack of staff time proving a barrier to more formal processes.\nHowever, they are positive, and staff are becoming more evaluation-aware, and planning better\nmonitoring in the future.\nFinally, and encouragingly, we are beginning to receive positive and complimentary feedback\n9 0 \u2022 \u2022 -s\nVolume 4 Number I\nM Departments\nAdvised by ETS\n\u2022 Departments\nProducing CAL\n\u2022 Departments\nDelivering CAL\n10\n1990\/1 1991\/2 1992\/3 1993\/4 1994\/5\nFigure !\nfrom the national Teaching Quality Assurance (TQA) visitations (for example, in one of our\nmodern language departments) as well as from external examiners (for example in veterinary\nanatomy).\nConclusion\nThe impact of the ETS has been considerable. The number of departments advised has risen to\n45 in the last four years. In the same period, the number of departments producing CAL\nmaterials has increased from 3 to 30, and those delivering some form of CAL to their students\nhas increased from 3 to 21 (see Figure 1).\nIt is important to remember that a support unit in learning technology is not just a technical or\neven an academic service, but an agent to effect and underpin cultural change within an\ninstitution. It is also worth noting that activities in support of the adoption of learning\ntechnology have a number of unanticipated and significant side-effects. Client academics have\ndemonstrated improved teaching ability, have developed project design and management\nskills, have structured collaborative teaching, and have acquired IT skills. Transferable skills\nsuch as these are already seen to be important in students, and their development is of course\nequally important in staff.\nReferences\nBrowning, P. and Williams, J.
