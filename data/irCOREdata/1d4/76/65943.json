The Slum Sanitation Programme (SSP) \u2013 the most ambitious urban \nsanitation intervention in Indian history \u2013 is premised upon \u201epartnership\u201f, \n\u201eparticipation\u201f and \u201ecost-recovery\u201f in the delivery of large toilet blocks as a practical \nsolution to the stark lack and inadequacy of sanitation in Mumbai\u201fs informal \nsettlements.  The SSP marks a significant change in the provision of sanitation \n 3 \ninfrastructure in the city.  The paper reflects on the progress of the SSP by considering \nthree key features of the programme: first, its policy infrastructure; second, its \ntechnical infrastructure, and third, its use of user charges as a basis for \u201ecost-recovery\u201f.  \nThe SSP provides an opportunity to explore a growing consensus on sanitation \nprovision among mainstream development agencies to focus on partnership, \nparticipation and cost-recovery.   \n \nThe paper argues for a more flexible approach to policy infrastructure, technical \ninfrastructure, and cost recovery in sanitation interventions in informal settlements.  In \nthese three areas, the paper does not seek to settle a set of issues, but to contribute to \ndebate around the SSP.  In addition, the paper seeks to contribute to more general \ndebates both on urban sanitation in informal settlements and on urban development.  \nMuch has been made of the notions of partnership and participation by mainstream \ndevelopment institutions in recent years.  They are buzzwords in the planning and \nimplementation of interventions globally, associated with what can be described as a \n\u201epost-Washington consensus\u201f or a \u201erevised neoliberal position\u201f (Mohan and Stokke, \n2000).  This position reflects a cautious approach to the earlier view that the market \ncould deliver development, and emphasises the role of an efficient and transparent \nstate as a facilitator of development, with civil society as an implementer (Pieterse, \n2001; Jenkins, 2002; UN Habitat, 2003: 224-264).   \n \nNotwithstanding the relative neglect of sanitation by mainstream development \nagencies and governments over the years, recent years have witnessed a shift in the \nnature of formal efforts to provide sanitation to informal settlements, with a growing \nemphasis by development agencies on \u201ecommunity-driven\u201f sanitation initiatives (UN \n 4 \nHabitat, 2003).  International development agencies increasingly argue that effective \nsanitation provision in informal settlements in low and middle-income countries must \ncentre on \u201ccommunity mobilization\u201d and seek to \u201ccreate support and ownership\u201d \nwithin settlements (UN Millennium Project, 2005: 1-2).  Similarly, the 2003 World \nDevelopment Report argues that \u201ecommunity participation\u201f is a prerequisite for \nsuccess (World Bank, 2003).  The World Bank has made this logic a prerequisite of \nfunding for the SSP.  In addition, as is increasingly the case in urban sanitation \ninterventions (Davis, 2006), the SSP charges people for use in order to reduce \nsubsidies and help engender what various agents on the programme view as a \u201esense of \ncommunity ownership\u201f.  In terms of technical infrastructure, the paper will reflect on \nthe difficulties with the toilet blocks in the SSP, and in terms of user charges the paper \nwill suggest that a more informed and cautious approach may be necessary.  As with \nthe case of policy infrastructure, the paper will argue that a more flexible approach \nbased on the diverse social geographies of informal settlements could be fruitful. \n \nDespite a large literature on urban sanitation in India (for instance, Bapat and Agarwal, \n2003; Chaplin, 1999; Davis, 2004; Hobson, 2000; Kundu, 1993; Patel, forthcoming) \nand more generally (for instance, Melosi, 2000; Pellow, 2002), there has been little \ninvestigation of sanitation in Mumbai.  Launched in 1997, the SSP is a \u201edemand-\ndriven\u201f programme that aims to treat slum dwellers \u201cas initiators, collaborators and \nresources to build on\u201d (BMC, no date: 9).  The programme has the long-term aim of \nensuring adequate sanitation is provided to all people living in informal settlements \nbefore 1995 by 2025.  It aims to provide one toilet seat for every 50 people, and \ngenerally takes the form of large toilet blocks.  The SSP is often portrayed as a shift \nfrom a model of state provision of sanitation in Mumbai to a model that is \n 5 \n\u201cparticipatory and demand-driven in nature\u201d (World Bank, 1995: 123; Sanyal and \nMukhija, 2001).  The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), using World \nBank credit and matching funds from the state (Maharashtra) government, pays for \nwater, sewer and electricity connections, and provides land.  Contractors \u2013 \nnongovernmental organisations (NGOs) and engineering firms \u2013 are responsible for \nbuilding the blocks.  After construction, the contractor maintains the block for one \nyear on behalf of the \u201ecommunity\u201f, and then local Community Based Organisations \n(CBOs) manage the blocks through a corpus fund that local people donate to, \ngenerally, on a monthly basis.  Maintenance generally takes the form of a paid local \ncaretaker, who often lives on the second floor of the block with his family and who is \nusually from a deprived caste (Black and Talbot, 2005; Pathak, 1991).   \n \nThe paper will proceed by locating the SSP in the broader relationship between the \nstate and \u201eslum\u201f in Mumbai.  It will then discuss the nature of sanitation in Mumbai\u201fs \ninformal settlements, before considering the SSP\u201fs policy infrastructure, technical \ninfrastructure and principle of cost recovery.  In conclusion, it will consider the role of \nthe SSP in the state-\u201eslum\u201f relation.  The paper is based on fieldwork conducted in \nMumbai between November 2005 and April 2006 comparing, among other things, \nsanitation conditions in different informal settlements, and is part of an ongoing \nresearch programme that explores the relationship between the everyday use of \ninfrastructure in informal settlements and the state.  In addition to fieldwork, the \ntentative reflections on sanitation and the SSP programme presented in the paper draw \non the work of researchers based at Mumbai\u201fs Tata Institute for Social Sciences (Tata, \n1998; Sharma and Bhide, 2005), as well as on joint research by a Mumbai NGO \u2013 \nYouth for Unity and Voluntary Action (YUVA) - and consultancy Montgomery \n 6 \nWatson (MW-YUVA, 2000; 2001).   \n \nThe state and informal settlements in Mumbai \n \nThe World Bank recently flew in a group of experts to solve Bombay\u201fs sanitation crisis\u2026The bank\u201fs \nsolution was to propose building 100,000 public toilets.  It was an absurd idea.  I have seen public \nlatrines in the slums.  None of them work.  People defecate all around the toilets, because the pits have \nbeen clogged for months or years.  To build 100,000 public toilets is to multiply this problem a \nhundredfold.  Indians do not have the same civic sense as, say, Scandinavians. \nSuketu Mehta (2004: 118). \n \nMumbai, formerly Bombay\n1, is an island city located on India\u201fs west coast connected \nto the mainland through a series of bridges.  With a population of 16 million people, it \nis the largest city in India and one of the largest in the world (Swaminathan, 2003: 81).  \nThe city\u201fs economy, particularly the southwest area of Nariman Point, has \nincreasingly globalised since the economic liberalisation reforms in 1985 and 1991.  \nThe city is responsible for over half of India\u201fs foreign trade (Wagh, 2004: 41), has \nbecome a centre for India\u201fs global dealings in financial and producer services (Grant \nand Nijman, 2004: 331), and constitutes 40% of the country\u201fs annual direct central \nrevenue (Rajeev, 2005: 27).  It is the capital of the state of Maharashtra, the state with \nthe highest-ranking per capita income in India (Kamdar, 2005: 28), and constitutes \n20% of the state\u201fs GDP (Bombay First, 2003: 12).   \n                                                          \n1\n Bombay was renamed Mumbai in 1995 by the state government controlled by the Hindu \nfundamentalist party Shiv Sena, which currently controls the municipal corporation.  This renaming has \nbeen part of a volatile debate around the identity of the city, nationalism and ethnicity (Appadurai \n2000; Hansen 2001). \n 7 \n \nIf Mumbai is often spoken and written of as India\u201fs \u201emost modern city\u201f (Rao, 2006), \nthis discourse has taken a new turn with the emergence of a new managerial and \ntechnical elite associated with the growth of global financial services in particular \nparts of the city (Grant and Nijman, 2002).  The geographies of these groups are \nincreasingly segregated and exclusive, reflecting new spaces of global connection and \nlocal disconnection, and are often associated with particular images of what the \nmodern Indian city should look like.  There has been an important role in this regard \nfor the \u201cintensified circulation of images of global cities through cinema, television, \nand the internet\u201d, and through the increasing tendency of the elite and middle classes \nto travel globally (Chatterjee, 2004: 143).  The state is increasingly seeking to attract \ninvestment and to develop infrastructure that will facilitate new globalising service \nand financial industries.  Recent years have witnessed intense debates around the \ntransformation of public space, provoked particularly by an increasing corpratisation \nof space that has followed India\u201fs economic liberalisation reforms.  For example, a \nrecent controversial ruling by the Supreme Court will see two-thirds of the vacant \n\u201emill lands\u201f in the centre of the city transformed not into social housing as many had \nhoped but into shopping malls and corporate entertainment (for a review of the decline \nof the mills, see D\u201fMonte, 2002).   \n \nDespite the city\u201fs impressive economic statistics, one influential report argues that \nMumbai is in \u201creverse gear\u201d in terms of economic growth and quality of life, noting a \ndrop of 7% to 2.4% in the city\u201fs GDP per annum between 1994 and 2002, and \nhighlighting the increasing number of people living in informal settlements, alongside \ngrowing anxieties over congestion and pollution (Bombay First, 2003: 12).  Others \n 8 \nhave pointed out that the city\u201fs economic growth has been highly uneven, restricted to \nwealthy groups and areas of the city.   \n \nOver half of the city\u201fs population lives in informal settlements of varying \ninfrastructure, income, economy, ethnicity and religion, squeezed into whatever space \ncan be found from bridges and railways to pavements and shantytowns.  The growth in \ninformal settlements reflects both the spectacular rise in real estate prices during the \n1990s driven by the city\u201fs economic growth (Appadurai, 2000), and the inadequacy of \nthe state\u201fs social housing commitment (Verma, 2002).  Most people in informal \nsettlements lack security of tenure, live in poor quality housing vulnerable to monsoon \nrains, suffer from frequent bouts of state or private demolition, lack access to sufficient \nand clean water and sanitation facilities, and live in highly polluted environments \nvulnerable to illness and disease.  As the informal population continues to grow \n(Swaminathan, 2003), the task of providing adequate infrastructure becomes more \nchallenging.  Given that there is often a weak relationship between income and access \nto basic services and infrastructures in Mumbai\u201fs informal settlements (Swaminathan, \n2003), it is unlikely that economic growth itself could be a solution to these issues \n(Mitlin and Satterthwaite, 2004).   \n \nIn the quote that opens this section, Mehta, author of the popular Maximum City: \nBombay Lost and Found, echoes comments made by Indian colonialists and \nnationalists alike in suggesting that there is something intrinsic to Indian culture that \nprecludes the growth of civic consciousness (Chakrabarty, 2002).  Mehta\u201fs \ndenouncement of the SSP, particularly remarkable considering that the scheme is \nconcerned with basic social welfare, is not just an expression of pointlessness, but a \n 9 \ncomplaint that the scheme will actually make sanitation conditions in the city worse.   \nIn this comment \u2013 and there have been many like it in the past \u2013 \u201eslum\u201f is positioned \nas hopeless urban melancholia (Hansen, 2006).  Moreover, in debates around public \nspace in urban India, in which \u201eslum\u201f inhabits a contentious space, people living in \ninformal settlements are often depicted as \u201eproblem\u201f rather than \u201ecitizen\u201f.   \n \nChatterjee (2004) has argued, amongst others (e.g. Verma, 2002), that people living in \ninformal settlements are not treated on a par with \u201eproper citizens\u201f.  In part, there are \nlegal reasons for this.  A full recognition of legitimacy by the state to informal \nsettlements in their illegal occupation of land would threaten the structure of legally \nheld property.  However, for urban authorities there are important social, economic \nand political reasons for extending services to the poor, ranging from ethnic ties and \nthe availability of low-cost labour to the readiness of, in Mumbai\u201fs case, the city\u201fs \nlargest voting population to support particular political candidates.  As a result, a range \nof services and facilities are \u201cextended on a case-to-case, ad hoc, or exceptional basis, \nwithout jeopardizing the overall structure of legality and property\u201d (Chatterjee, 2004: \n137).   \n \nThese services are focussed on populations rather than citizens, in the terrain of what \nChatterjee calls the \u201eheterogeneous social\u201f rather than the homogeneous social of \ncitizenship.  The \u201eslum\u201f emerges as a demographic targeted for welfare, set apart from \nthe homogeneous space of citizenship where rights may be expected, and provided to \non a haphazard and piecemeal fashion.  In contrast to the domain of citizenship, \npopulations do not bear any inherent moral claim on the state.  The policies and \ninterventions that take place in this context, in what Chatterjee refers to as political \n 10 \nsociety, should be understood as \u201can attempt to calibrate rewards and costs, incentives \nand punishments, in order to produce the desired outcomes.  Thus, slums may be \nprovided with sanitation in the exception that slum-dwellers would not dirty in the \nstreets or parks\u201d (Chatterjee, 2004: 137-8).  \n \nPrior to the SSP, toilet blocks were provided on an ad hoc basis through city MP, \nMLA (Members of the Legislative Assembly, Maharashtra state), or city corporator \nfunds, often reflecting voting patterns or ethnic and religious ties.  The SSP is an \nattempt to alter the agents and practices of sanitation delivery, constituting a change in \nthe relationship between state and \u201eslum\u201f, and is in part a reaction to a sense that the \nad hoc model is failing to reach large numbers.  It is also driven by a sense that \ncommunities would be more effective in toilet block maintenance than the state \nbecause through participation in the SSP they would have a stake in the blocks.   \n \nThe municipal corporation\u201fs budget for sanitation has grown exponentially in recent \nyears, driven by state and donor concerns around public health within settlements.  \nPublic health concerns emerge more from the state and civil society campaigners than \nfrom middle class fears of disease and illness.  Despite sporadic concerns in different \nparts of the city, the middle classes, as in many Indian cities, are generally able to \ninsulate themselves from infection (Chaplin 1999).  On the contrary, many middle-\nclass neighbourhood organisations in Mumbai, such as many of the increasingly \npopular Advanced Locality Management groups, interpret the sanitising of urban \nspace through a logic of demolition rather than one of improvement of informal \nsettlements.  They often campaign to \u201crid the city of encroachers and polluters and, as \nit were, to give the city back to its proper citizens\u201d (Chatterjee, 2004: 140).   \n 11 \n \nWhile the SSP is a regulatory intervention, it is important to note that because the \n\u201eslum\u201f inhabits a grey area between legality and illegality, and because of its \ncontentious focus in debates about public space, state (and private) interventions are \noften just as likely to take the form of violence.  If Mumbai is often described as \n\u201eIndia\u201fs most modern city\u201f, it is also often simultaneously described as a city at the \nlimit, a maximum city (Mehta, 2004).  The \u201eslum\u201f haunts both these depictions.  It is \nin part because of this relationship that we see both welfare-oriented interventions \nsuch as the SSP on the one hand, and violent acts of state demolition on the other.  \nThese strategies overlap; it is not uncommon for settlements to be part of, for instance, \nthe SSP, and also be subject to demolition.  These disparate strategies, of course, have \ndifferent logics, histories and often involve different agents, but together they \nconstitute the changing and often unpredictable field of relations between state and \ninformal settlement.   \n \nIn Mumbai, the demolition of informal settlements became increasingly coded by a \npolitics of ethnicity during the 1990s, reflected in the rise of the Shiv Sena (Shivaji\u201fs \nArmy), the regionalist Hindu fundamentalist ruling party in the BMC who took the \nstate and city in the 1995 elections (Hansen, 2001; Punwani, 2003).  The Shiv Sena \nhas long argued that immigrants in informal settlements are the main reason for \nMaharashtrians being unemployed, and has consistently invoked the figure of the \nmigrant and the Muslim as a source of crime and social disorder.  In recent years, \nhowever, the mass programme of demolition of post-2000 informal settlements has \nbeen coded less by ethnicity than politico-corporate Mumbai\u201fs self-declared trajectory \nto become the \u201enext Shanghai\u201f by 2013 (Bombay First, 2003).   \n 12 \n \nAn estimated 90,000 huts were torn down during the winter of 2004-2005, leaving \nsome 350,000 people homeless and without alternative accommodation.  The January \n1\nst\n 2000 cut-off was set by the state-run Slum Rehabilitation Authority, and is an \narbitrary date (recently moved following protests from 1995, which remains the cut-\noff for eligibility in the SSP) that allows the state government and municipal \ncorporation to ignore or remove more recent settlements.  It is in the cut-off date that \nwe see formal acknowledgement by the state of its approach to \u201eslums\u201f as \nsimultaneously violent and regulatory, sovereign and disciplinary.  Indeed, the cut-off \ndate can be interpreted as an attempt to resolve this contradiction.  Although outwith \nthe scope of this paper, understanding the operation of violence is critical to \nunderstanding the changing nature of governance, rights and citizenship in \ncontemporary Mumbai (Rao, 2006).  Before going on to reflect on the SSP based on \nrecent fieldwork and literature, I will give a brief overview of sanitation conditions in \nthe city\u201fs informal settlements. \n \nSanitation in Mumbai\u2019s informal settlements \n \nIn Bhabrekar Nagar, in the northwest suburb of Malad, three small toilet blocks of 10 \nseats each provide for 4000 people.  They were constructed before the SSP using the \nwelfare fund of a local MP who contributed a sum of Rs. 1 lakh (\u00a31,180)\n2\n for the three \nblocks.  Now, local people are frustrated at the lack of maintenance.  The toilets are \nnot connected to the sewer, and the aqua-privy system blocks regularly.  There is no \n                                                          \n2\n At the time of writing, \u00a31 was equivalent to Rs. 84, while $1 was equivalent to Rs. 46.  Rs. 1 lakh is \nequivalent to Rs. 100,000, and Rs. 1 crore is equivalent to Rs. 10 million. \n 13 \nwater connection (water is collected from a bore well) or electricity connection, so the \nblocks are not used at night.  The poor condition of the blocks, combined with \nfrequently long queues, means that half the people in the area routinely use the nearby \njangal (uncultivated land), among fields and trees.  Many of the woman said that they \npreferred to be in an open space than to use an unclean toilet, even though this makes \nthem more vulnerable to harassment.  The toilets are maintained at Rs 10 per month \nper household, which funds one caretaker.   \n \nThe blocks are a source of tension with an adjacent informal settlement that has \nappeared in the last few years.  The settlement \u2013 Ambuj Dadi \u2013 is using the blocks, \nleading to increased waiting time and uncleanliness. The local committee that \nmaintains the blocks tried putting locks on the doors, but they were broken.  Figure 1 \nshows the toilet block on the dividing line between Bhabrekar Nagar and Ambuj Dadi.  \nAmbuj Dadi is striking in its contrast to Bhabrekar Nagar.  There are no toilets, no \nwater supply, no garbage collection, no electricity, and less space.  Housing is \nsackcloth.  The area around Bhabrekar Nagar reveals the extent of variation in living \nconditions in Mumbai.  In the space of one kilometer, housing and infrastructure vary \nfrom sackcloth, to tin, to brick, to multi-story apartments.  People are located next to \ninfrastructures that they cannot use, and the use of these infrastructures (especially \ntoilets and water) has become a contentious issue.  Informal settlements can be \nintensely territorial, divided along lines of ethnicity, religion, economic functioning \nand time of and place of migration (Benjamin, 2004; Verma, 2002).  This can lead to a \ncompetition for resources that politicians often exploit for electoral gain.   \n \nFigure 1: Bhabrekar Nagar and Ambuj Dadi  \n 14 \n \nThese contrasting spaces at Malad point to both the inequalities in sanitation across \nMumbai and its inadequacy in informal settlements.  Globally, less than one-third of \nthe population in most urban centres in Africa, Asia and Latin America are provided \nby what the UN has referred to as \u201egood quality sanitation\u201f, and as many as 100 \nmillion urban dwellers world-wide are forced to defecate in the open or into waste \npaper or plastic bags because public toilets are not available, too distant or too \nexpensive (UN Habitat, 2003: xvii).  In Mumbai, the pressures of sanitation are most \nstarkly posed for the six million people living in informal settlements, constituting \n54% of the population and crammed into 1959 slum settlements occupying 8% of the \nland (MW-YUVA, 2001).  Most of these settlements lack systems for disposal of \nexcreta, sewage, sullage (water from washing and bathing) and solid wastes, \nconstituting significant health and environmental dangers.  Specifically, the disposal of \nhuman waste is major problem (Swaminathan, 2003: 94).  A 2001 survey of all 24 \nwards in the city provided a picture of sanitation in Mumbai\u201fs informal settlements \nthat was to form a basis of the SSP.   \n \nThe survey found that 63% of the city\u201fs informal population - 3.92 million people - \nwas dependent exclusively on public toilets for their sanitation needs (MW-YUVA, \n2001: 17).  While the average ratio of persons per toilet seat in informal settlements \nwas 81:1, the variation went from 273:1 in A ward to 56:1 in F\/S and S wards, often \nresulting in queues lasting two hours or more (MW-YUVA, 2001: 4).  It found that \nmen often get preference in use of blocks in the morning; women are often forced to \nwait until late morning when they are finished household work.  A disproportionate \nshare of the labour and the burden of ill health related to sanitation inadequacies fall \n 15 \non women (Bapat and Agarwal, 2003: 71).  Not only is there the humiliation of going \nto the toilet in full public view (which often results in women waiting until cover of \ndarkness, and even to eat and drink less to reduce the chances of going during the \nday), there is also the threat from water-borne diseases, and the ecology of odours and \nchannels \u201cwhere cooking water, washing water, and shit-bearing water are not \ncarefully segregated\u201d (Appadurai, 2002: 39).   \n \nWhile the informal settlements on BMC owned land (just under half the informal \npopulation) were the most provided for, most existing toilet blocks were found to be \nlargely lacking in facilities essential for their proper functioning.  Running water, \nelectricity and wastebins, squatting pans for children, urinals and bathrooms, were \noften either missing or in poor condition.  One estimate has since suggested that one in \nevery three toilet blocks provided through city MP, MLA, or city corporator funds are \ndysfunctional within six months due to overuse and inadequate water supply (Lewis, \n2004).  According to the 2001 survey, only 39% of the blocks had electricity, in most \ncases provided at the initiative of local people, where the households using the toilet \nblock have illegally extended the electricity supply from a house and agree to share the \nmonthly bill (MW-YUVA, 2001: 35).  Just 14% of the blocks had a water supply of \nany kind \u2013 legal of illegal \u2013 due to the costs involved (ibid).  An estimated 31% were \nconnected to the sewer system, with the rest operating through septic tanks or aqua-\nprivy systems that frequently block due to high pressures (ibid).  This compares with a \nfigure of 45% for major cities in Asia more generally (UN Habitat, 2003: 9).    \n \nThe cleaning of blocks by BMC conservancy staff was found to be sporadic, and there \nwere many cases where staff had to be bribed to do the work.  A common alternative \n 16 \nis often in the form of a \u201esweeper\u201f who is privately appointed by local people for \ncleaning the toilets.  The majority of people in informal settlements pay for their \ntoilets.  The range of payment varied from Rs. 5 per month to Rs. 100 per month, with \nthe majority (91%) of households making a payment of less than Rs. 15 per month \n(MW-YUVA, 2001: 20).  The total slum population forced to defecate in the open was \nestimated at 1.78 million (28%) (MW-YUVA, 2001: 18).   \n \nWith the data from the survey, settlements were to be prioritised according to need in \nthe SSP.  However, while progress sped-up, and some settlements were privileged due \nto need, the \u201edemand-driven\u201f nature of the programme has meant that settlements that \nhave approached the BMC have been privileged.  Inevitably, areas with very active \nCBOs are in a better position to approach the Mumbai Sewage Disposal Programme \n(MSDP) - the BMC department that runs the SSP - than areas without.  For example, \nan informal settlement at Cheeta Camp in northeast Mumbai was prioritised because \nof an active CBO, even though the number and condition of available toilets was \nbetter than in other nearby areas (Tata, 1998).  Areas that don\u201ft approach the MSDP \nsimply don\u201ft get any provision through the scheme.  In the next three sections I will \nreflect on three of the most important features of the scheme: first, the policy \ninfrastructure; second, the technical infrastructure; and third, the principle of paying \nfor use. \n \nPartnership, participation and toilet blocks \n \nThe BMC, and the large NGO involved in the programme \u2013 the Society for Promotion \nof Area Resource Centres (SPARC) - often describe the SSP as an example of \n 17 \ncommunity empowerment and revival.  BMC officials speak of a \u201csense of \nownership\u201d and \u201cbelonging \u2013 that toilet belongs to me\u201d.  One BMC report claims that \nthere is a \u201chigh level of satisfaction among the users\u201d and that there is a \u201csense of \ncommunity ownership among user community groups\u201d (BMC, no date: 23). To be \nsure, many people talk with pride about a well-run toilet block, and involvement with \nthe SSP can be a spur for other public health activities.  There are cases where toilet \nblocks have become community centres, where upstairs meeting areas or caretakers \nrooms have become spaces to teach children who work as child labourers and don\u201ft \nattend school, to hold nursery schools or computer classes, or to have CBO meetings.  \nHowever, it appears that in practice very few people within settlements are involved in \ndesign and maintenance.  In this section, I will provisionally consider how discourses \nof partnership and participation operate in practice in the SSP by drawing on recent \nliterature.  This discussion will not be a review of the performance of CBO \nmaintenance; this is a subject of future research.  Given that most of the SSP blocks \nhave been open for just one to three years, it is too early to say with certainty whether \nmaintenance is more effective than with blocks in the past, and initial research has \nindicated mixed results.       \n \nThe participatory approach in the SSP was a pre-condition of World Bank funding.  \nAs Sharma and Bhide (2005: 1785), who have conducted interview-based research on \nall of the agencies involved in the project, have written: \u201cThe inherent assumption here \nhas been that the NGOs and CBOs to be involved in the SSP were accountable, non-\ncorrupt and pro-people\u201d.  The implementation of the SSP was phased out in four \nstages: publicity and selection of communities; demand assessment and preparation of \nplans for operation and maintenance; design and construction; and operation and \n 18 \nmaintenance by the beneficiaries through CBOs.  The first phase (publicity) involved \nfour NGOs and revealed a lack of enthusiasm for the scheme: \u201cOut of the 141 targeted \ncommunities, 105 (75 per cent) were not willing to join the SSP at all. Only nine \ncommunities reported 76 per cent of their members willing to join the SSP\n3\n.  In all, 19 \ncommunities applied for the programme. Among these, only nine communities paid \nthe upfront contribution\u201d (Sharma and Bhide, 2005: 1785).  Much of the reason for a \nlack of enthusiasm was due to the costs involved (the issue of costs will be explored \nlater in the paper).  In addition, many communities were enrolled in early negotiations \naround the controversial state Slum Rehabilitation Authority Scheme for housing \nrelocation, which meant they would have little to gain from the intervention (see \nMukhija, 2003).  People were also reluctant to move from their homes in order to \nmake way for a toilet block, stalling the identification of appropriate sites within \nsettlements. \n \nDespite delays, by December 2004 total contracts worth Rs 64 crore (\u00a37.5 million) had \nbeen awarded for construction of 8,000 toilet seats in 400 toilet blocks spread over the \n24 wards of Mumbai, an average of 20 seats per block (Sharma and Bihde, 2005: \n1787).  On average, that amounts to just under a substantial \u00a3940 per seat, although \none BMC official claimed the figure was closer to \u00a3825 per seat.  Although there were \noriginally plans for several contractors, there are now just three contractors involved.  \nTwo of these are engineering firms - Babul Uttamchand (BU), and B. Narayan and \nAssociates (BNA), who by October 2004 had been allocated 18% and 13% of the \nwork orders issued by the BMC for toilet blocks.  The remaining 69% of the work \n                                                          \n3\n Initially, the World Bank condition was that 75% of a community be in favour of the block \u2013 the \nBank later reduced this to 50% following a lack of support. \n 19 \norders were issued to the only NGO on the programme, SPARC, awarded both \nbecause SPARC\u201fs bid was the lowest and because of the high profile of the NGO in \nthe city and among international donors.  SPARC works as part of a tripartite \npartnership with two CBOs - the National Slum Dwellers Federation (NSDF), and \nMahila Milan (MM, \u2018Women Together\u2019) (Patel, 2001; Patel and Mitlin, 2001).  \nSPARC\u201fs work explores new forms of governance so that, one, the poor can forge \ntheir own initiatives and, two, the state can be held accountable to the poor (Patel and \nMitlin, 2001: 5).  The NGO has developed a strong presence in urban politics in \nMumbai and has expanded nationally and internationally.  As Appadurai (2002: 25) \nhas written: \u201cOf the six or seven non-state organizations working directly with the \nurban poor in Mumbai, the Alliance [of SPARC, NSDF, and MM] has by far the \nlargest constituency, the highest visibility in the eyes of the state and the most \nextensive networks in India and elsewhere in the world\u201d.   \n \nSSP funds are allocated through the BMC on a block by block basis.  SPARC received \na record 278 work orders covering 20 wards.  This constitutes the largest allocation of \ndevelopmental work by the state to an NGO in India.  BU received work orders for \nthree wards and BNA for one ward.  Why was an NGO given such a significant role?  \nPart of the answer is SPARC\u201fs international reputation.  The SPARC leadership has \ncontacts and approval at the World Bank and the BMC.  Moreover, SPARC\u201fs bids \nwere almost Rs. 10 million less than any other group\u201fs tender (Patel and Mitlin, 2004: \n225); another popular but smaller NGO in the city, Youth for Unity and Voluntary \nAction (YUVA), as well as the large NGO, Sulabh International, had their bids \nrejected because SPARC\u201fs was far lower.  In addition, few other NGOs could claim \nthe popular grassroots support that SPARC has in the city, and the SSP was to be \n 20 \nrooted in people\u201fs participation.  There was an assumption made by the Bank and \nBMC that SPARC would be able to speed-up the programme and ensure a greater \ninvolvement of local people because it was an NGO known for community-based \nwork.  For these reasons, not only did SPARC become the only NGO on the project, it \ntook on by far the largest share of the work.   \n \nHowever, Sharma and Bihde (2005: 1788) have written, \u201cSPARC faced the uphill task \nof motivating such a large number of households, and also maintaining the target of \ncompleting the construction work within [the] next six months or so\u201d.  Indeed, in order \nto reach beyond its base and speed up an increasingly delayed programme, SPARC \nsought the assistance of its political contacts.  For example, it contacted Pratishtan, an \nNGO \u201cpatronised by a member of Parliament\u201d and invited Antyoday Parishad, \n\u201canother NGO with political patronage \u2013 to reach out to the people\u201d (ibid).  Rather \nthan using its base to deliver a community-led planned and implemented sanitation \ninitiative, the claim made by Sharma and Bihde is that SPARC have effectively \ndeployed their political contacts in order to progress work, sometimes to the \nmarginalisation of many people within the settlement: \n \nAs expected, it would not be easy to vacate people from a few houses, if the space occupied by them \nwas required for locating the sanitation blocks.  In such situations, the only way out has been to take \nlocal political groups into confidence first rather than waiting for the consent of the affected people, and \nrelocate them elsewhere.  If the formed CBOs coincide with the existing political groups\/associations, \nthe results are easily forthcoming.  In fact, as understood from some officials of BMC, in several cases, \npeople came to know about construction of toilets in their areas through political groups or formed \nCBOs.  For them, SPARC is more engaged in \u201efire fighting\u201f than a community based approach to the \nSSP.  In some cases, steps are being followed in forming a CBO, collecting upfront contribution and \nregistering the CBOs.  In other cases, if this is not materialising, the decisions are being taken to go \n 21 \nahead with the selection of sites and construction of toilets, of course, with the consent of local \npoliticians (Sharma and Bhide, 2005: 1788).  \n \nThrough the course of the SSP, partnership among plural organisations has been \ntranslated into, in effect, one NGO, while participation has been translated into well-\nconnected individuals or groups.  In place of local involvement, plans move along \nquickly often without consultation of local people.  Sharma and Bhide (2005) rightly \nargue that no single NGO has the capacity to take on the level of work that SPARC \ntook on.  There has been insufficient emphasis in the SSP on working with \ncommunities at the grassroots, rather than just local leaders.  In addition, participation \nin CBO\u201fs is often low, and activities are often run through a small CBO that is not \nrepresentative of the community and that may make important decisions without \nconsulting others in the local area.   \n \nSome CBOs are religiously oriented, with perhaps only 40% of the community \nsupporting them, and the processes of deciding who is to be included, commenting on \ndesign, collecting money, and maintaining the block, can be fraught with conflict \n(MG-YUVA, 2001: 11).  Working with local or political leaders has the effect of \nmarginalising those whom they do not represent, particularly given that informal \nsettlements are often deeply divided around ethnic, religious, class and economic lines.  \nAttention to the power relations within communities, and a more detailed \nunderstanding people\u201fs sanitation needs and desires, is important if sanitation delivery \nis to be participatory in practice.  In some settlements, a politics of space effectively \nrestricts access for particular ethnic groups or recent migrants.  While SPARC are \nunder considerable pressures to mobilise CBO\u201fs and begin construction quickly, \nSharma and Bhide\u201fs (2005) research indicates a need for the project to be more \n 22 \nattentive to the social geographies of informal settlements if marginalised groups are \nto become involved.   \n \nThe SSP raises a question about the dominance of large NGOs in urban development.  \nSPARC is a highly connected NGO with excellence in communicating its work.  \nHowever, such a significant presence on the political map of the city leaves little space \nfor smaller organisations who may have demonstrated capacities for specific aspects of \ndevelopment, from publicity to construction to working with communities.  On \nSPARC, Sharma and Bhide (2005: 1789) go further: \u201cMoreover, there is no criticality \nof reflection in their own style of work.  They determine the boundaries and the \nagendas of the discourse\u201d.  SPARC\u201fs liberal entrepreneurial politics, which is more \nlikely to accommodate the agendas of realpolitik than to contest them with radical \npolitics, reduces the space for civil society groups to influence the direction of policy \nand public debate (McFarlane, 2004).  Smaller NGOs in the city spoke in interviews \nabout the difficulties of becoming involved in housing or infrastructure projects when \nSPARC are involved.  SPARC have increasingly come to stand for \u201ecivil society\u201f in \nformal development projects, and the level of influence that they have should act as a \ncaution to the role of \u201esuper NGOs\u201f in other development contexts.  As Sharma and \nBhide (2005: 1789) conclude: \u201cIn this context, when participation takes on a \nconsumerist orientation while its other dimensions, e.g., education, empowerment get \nsidelined, change is translated into single-point agendas.  Rather than becoming \nrepresentatives of popular views and opinions, NGOs too seem to be co-opted by the \nsystem.  There is a need therefore, to review the terms of the discourse and move \ntowards plurality\u201d.   \n \n 23 \nThe SSP could usefully allow space for smaller, more specialised organisations \u2013 that \nare not simply divisively associated with particular ethnic, religious or political groups \nin the settlement - to use their expertise in particular settlements in order to broaden \nthe level and nature of participation.  This may lead to a longer process, but one that \ndraws more fully on the views of people throughout settlements in the design and \nconstruction of sanitation.  In the next section, I suggest that this plurality must be \nextended not just to the policy infrastructure in the SSP, but also to the technical \ninfrastructure.  In the final section, I explore the \u201cconsumerist orientation\u201d of the SSP \nin more detail by considering the focus on user charges, and in doing so I reiterate the \npotential need for a more flexible, plural structure. \n \nTechnical infrastructure: design and construction \n \nOne BMC official on the SSP programme lamented the slow progress of the SSP: \n\u201c[For eight years we have been] struggling to implement the slum sanitation \nprogramme.  And how much have we done?  Very insignificant \u2013 only 328 blocks\u201d.  \nInitially, the first phase of the SSP \u2013 325 blocks - was to be completed by 2000, but \ndelays pushed this back into December 2005.  By October 2004, according to BMC \nfigures, 318 work orders had been given, 274 of which were complete (or 86%).  The \nresults have indicated marked improvements in sanitation provision, but beyond the \ndelays there are significant technical shortcomings.  70 (25%) of the new blocks \nlacked a water connection and 81 (30%) lacked an electricity connection.  This is \nsurprising given that it is typically easier to obtain electricity connections than water \nconnections due to its widespread domestic availability.  While one of the strengths of \nthe SSP has been its prioritising of water connections, 25% remain unconnected due to \n 24 \nthe costs involved.  SPARC has not performed as effectively as the two engineering \nfirms have, while BU emerges as the strongest performer.  As the previous section \nsuggested, SPARC may have been over-stretched by taking on such a large tender.  \nSeveral BMC officials complained that delays and construction difficulties were more \ncommon with SPARC-built blocks than others, and the stronger performance of the \nother contractors reflects their greater experience in construction and monitoring sub-\ncontractors.  In rare cases, SPARC-built blocks have not even been opened due to \nunsound construction.  91% of those blocks lacking a water connection were SPARC-\nbuilt while 93% of those lacking an electricity connection were SPARC-built.  Table \n1, taken from unpublished BMC data, compares the performance of the three agents \nup to October 2004, and compares the figures for water and electricity connection with \nthe situation in 2001\n4\n. \n \nTable 1: SSP progress until October 2004 \n Work orders \ncomplete (%) \nWater connection at \nsite of completed w.o. \n(%) \nElectricity connection at \nsite of completed w.o. \n(%) \nBU 96 95 96 \nBNA 92 89 89 \nSPARC 82 65 59 \nTOTAL 86 75 70 \n2001 Total -- 14 39 \n \nClearly, there is a significant improvement on the rate of blocks with water and \nelectricity connections (now more than two-thirds).  The completed blocks serve \nalmost 300,000 people.  One BMC official argued that the blocks are being widely \nused, but that use depends on three technical features: first, water for flushing, second, \nelectricity, and, third, effective maintenance.  He said: \u201cI would not conclude 100% \n                                                          \n4\n The 2001 figures are from the MW-YUVA (2001: 35) report. \n 25 \nsuccess, but improved [in comparison to blocks in the past]\u201d.  However, these figures \nshould be treated with some caution.  The figures say nothing of whether water or \nelectricity connections are working in practice, which, due to an inability or reluctance \nto pay bills, they often are not.  In addition, the relationship between water supply and \nthe geography of informal settlements effects who benefits from toilet blocks.  For \nexample, one difficulty lies in providing water uniformly throughout informal \nsettlements \u2013 often the geography of water reflects the clustering of economic \nactivities, which also often reflects ethnic territories in the settlement.  For instance, in \nShivaji Nagar, in Govandi in the northeast of the city, the water supply is sufficient in \nthe peripheral areas but not in the middle plots of the settlement.  This means that \nwhile blocks have been built on the relatively more prosperous periphery, people \nliving in the centre of the settlement have less access to toilets.  Water tankers, which \nare expensive, are often used to supplement the water supply for blocks.  In addition, \nwater \u201emafias\u201f often manipulate water connections and payment systems.  In a \ndifferent settlement in Govandi, water supply to the blocks is reduced because of \ngroups who have opened launderettes in the area in order to take advantage of \nsubsidised water supply to informal settlements.   \n \nFurther, the majority of the new toilet blocks are not connected to the sewer system \nbecause of the amount of time this engineering effort would require, and instead use \nseptic tanks that are prone to blocking or over-filling, and are often not cleared.  One \nBMC official estimated that only 28% of SSP toilet blocks are connected to sewers, \nwhile the figures from 2001 stated coverage of 31% (MW-YUVA, 2001: 35).  If \ncorrect, then the new SSP blocks are arguably more vulnerable to blockages than those \nin the past.  Some have been arguing for more of an emphasis on sewer connections, \n 26 \nbut many BMC engineers have replied that sewer connections are a later part of the \nmore general World Bank-sponsored sanitation drive in the city, and will be put in \nplace when the sewer network is extended.  By this point, some blocks may have lain \nunused for years due to blockages, and may have developed functional problems.  \nThat sewer connections have been marginalised in the programme is particularly \nunfortunate given the overwhelming global evidence linking higher rates of mortality \nand intestinal parasites among people without access to sewer connections compared \nto those with (UN Habitat, 2003: 79).  The principle of a circulatory network of water \nand sewage which benefits many of the middle and upper classes in the city, has not \nbeen extended to informal settlements.  \n \nNeither do the figures give a breakdown on use of the children\u201fs squatting platforms.  \nAccording to one BMC official, \u201calmost 60% [of the children\u201fs platforms] are not in \nuse\u201d.  While the children\u201fs platforms were a condition of World Bank loans, and while \nthe SSP survey cited earlier indicated a public preference for children\u201fs areas, many \nare not used either because in practice mothers want to keep their children in sight or \nbecause children opt for adult toilets in preference.  In some blocks, water supply to \nthe children\u201fs area has, as a result, been cut-off.  For example, in one block in Santa \nCruz, a western suburb, the children\u201fs area is now used as a storage area for \nmaintenance accessories.  One local said that it was closed because the children don\u201ft \nuse water to clean the toilet properly after use, and some individuals thought that the \nchildren\u201fs area should be removed to make way for additional facilities for women.  \nHowever, because there is no formal attempt by the state to monitor usage, these views \nare not being taken into consideration. \n \n 27 \nMaintenance is emerging as a difficulty in several areas.  Caretakers often cannot \nmaintain and clean blocks where the ratio of use is as high as 250 people to one seat.  \nYet one senior engineer at the BMC\u201fs MSDP said that the MSDP is not monitoring the \nblocks, stating that intervention in areas where CBOs are struggling to maintain blocks \nis \u201ccomplaint-oriented\u201d: \u201c[Then] we go, and we tell them you should maintain it, you \nshould clean it\u201d.  He claimed that this was rarely necessary: \u201cabout 1% maybe \ncomplains\u201d.  This seems unlikely given the amount of difficulties users of SSP toilet \nblocks across the city highlight. \n \nThe technical difficulties with the toilet blocks have led several commentators and \nparticipants in the SSP to criticise the universal \u201eone-size-fits-all\u201f approach.  There are \nseveral cases across the city where people have opted to use older blocks or nearby \nsheltered spaces.  Many local people, as well as some BMC staff, believe that a more \nflexible approach through which sanitation is planned specifically for each settlement \nwould be more effective.  While the original SSP plans envisaged a variety of \nsanitation options that would vary according to the contingencies of local geographies \n\u2013 from two-floor toilet blocks and twin toilets, to individual toilets and shared toilets, \nwhere two or three families share toilets through a lock-and-key system and mutual \nmaintainance \u2013 the programme has become rigidly based around large two- or even \nthree-floor structures.  This inflexibility is remarkable when we consider claims that \nthe SSP is \u201edemand-driven\u201f.  One BMC official, commenting on individual toilets, \nsaid \u201cwe should not encourage it\u201d, and cited cases in Dharavi where people \nconstructed individual toilets that came out of homes into storm drains.  This, \nhowever, only highlights the need to link sanitation provision to sewer connections.  \nEngineers often argue that in informal settlements, a lack of space within individual \n 28 \nhouses means that a common toilet block is the only possibility, and it is often \nimpossible to lay sewer pipes under a row of houses for individual toilets in a highly \ncongested area.  However, where possible individual, twin or shared toilets may \nreduce difficulties around maintenance because they are located within or beside \nhomes, creating a distinct incentive for families to maintain them.   The variation in \nthe geography of informal settlements is vast, and, as several engineers pointed out \nduring the research, there are many sites in the city where different options could be \ndeveloped.  Moreover, people continually put forward preferences for smaller or \nalternative structures.  There are successful examples of this elsewhere in South Asia, \nsuch as in the work of Orangi Pilot Project, an NGO in Karachi, through which \nlatrines and connecting pipes to sewers were installed in homes and lanes (Alimuddin \net al, 2004).  \n \nIn the case of individual toilets, it is not necessarily the case, as some have argued, that \nthey would be more expensive over the long-term, particularly when it is considered \nthat common toilet blocks \u2013 currently allocated an average of just under a substantial \n\u00a3940 per seat in the SSP - have a history of breaking-down very quickly due to poor \nconstruction and maintenance.  For example, rudimentary small-scale latrines and \ncollector pipes to sewers installed through the work of Anjuman Samaji Behbood in \nFaisalabad, Pakistan, amounted to under \u00a330 per home (Alimuddin et al, 2004: 154).  \nContributions are higher for individual families, meaning that for many poorer people \nindividual toilets are not an option if they were forced to pay.  However, there are \nmany people that would be able to afford higher costs and who expressed a preference \nfor individual toilets in interviews.  Controversially, one BMC official argued that the \ndemand for individual, twin or shared toilet blocks is being deliberately suppressed, \n 29 \narguing that the concept of individual toilets is not being marketed because it is not \n\u201cpart of the game\u201d.  One claim here, made by others but which requires further \ninvestigation, is that bureaucrats, politicians, and contractors view large toilet blocks \nas a political investment in informal settlements.  In particular, some more progressive \nBMC officials have argued that politicians are more concerned with associating \nthemselves with the provision of common blocks than individual, twin or shared \ntoilets because large blocks are highly visible and reach far more voters. \n \nEven though the SSP is designed in part as a shift from services linked to politicians to \nservices demanded by communities from bureaucrats, political parties and local BMC \ncorporators often try to use toilet blocks as a means of manipulating votes, part of the \nlong-established politics of patronage in informal settlements.  As noted earlier, this \ncan occur through contacts at SPARC.  Some BMC politicos have actively taken up \nthe cause of CBOs and associate themselves with the delivery of new blocks.  In one \ncase, a corporator who invested much energy in the scheme publicly associated \nhimself with the construction of 13 blocks in informal settlements in his constituency \nthrough large public events marking the opening of new blocks.   \n \nDespite improvements on previous conditions in settlements, and considering the \nimportance of sanitation in people\u201fs everyday lives, the disparity between the level of \nfunding and the final results in the SSP points to the need for reflection on strategy.  In \norder to ensure more effective structures over the long-term that reflects the needs and \ndesires of local people, it may be that the SSP should be more flexible in order to \naccommodate alternative sanitation options that would vary throughout and between \nsettlements, including individual, shared and twin structures.  This may lead to longer \n 30 \ntime delays, but could also lead to a more effective long-term sanitation provision.  \nThe experience of toilet blocks since long before the SSP points to the centrality of \nadequate water and electricity supplies for effective functioning of the blocks, and the \nhigh-pressure of use underlines the need to prioritise sewer connections if blocks are \nto last anywhere near the thirty-year life span that the SSP envisages.  In the final \nsection, I consider how user-charges are affecting the performance of the SSP.  \n \nToilets as cash-points? \n  \nThe solution to the sanitation crisis \u2013 at least as conceived by certain economics professors sitting in \ncomfortable armchairs in Chicago and Boston \u2013 has been to make urban defecation a global business.  \nIndeed, one of the great achievements of Washington-sponsored neoliberalism has been to turn public \ntoilets into cash points for paying off foreign debts \u2013 pay toilets are a growth industry throughout Third \nWorld slums. \nMike Davis (2006: 141). \n \nDavis describes public toilets in Ghana, introduced by the military government in \n1981 and privatised in the late 1990s, as a \u201cgold mine\u201d of profitability (Davis, 2006: \n141; Pellow, 2002).  He goes on: \u201cLikewise, in Kenyan slums such as Mathare it costs \n6 cents (US) for every visit to a privatized toilet; this is too expensive for most poor \npeople, who would prefer to defecate in the open and spend their money on water and \nfood\u201d (Davis, 2006: 141-142)5.  While in the case of Mumbai the toilet blocks in the \nSSP have not been privatised but handed over to \u201ecommunities\u201f, the principle of \npaying for use remains.  The focus on cost-recovery from the poor means that \n                                                          \n5\n For a discussion of different forms of sanitation construction, management and mantainance globally, \nsee UN Habitat (2003: 158-189). \n 31 \nsanitation is often provided not according to those who need it most, but according to \nhow many people can pay a contribution.  Here, I use a brief discussion of two \ndifferent settlements to reflect on the difficulties of a universal pay-for-use strategy.  \nThe first is a successful SSP block in the western suburb if Santa Cruz, and the second \nis a site in the northeast in Govandi where some of the first SSP blocks were \ncompleted. \n \nIn an informal settlement in Khotiwadi in Santa Cruz, two SSP blocks are run by a \nlocal CBO.  The settlement is relatively well off.  It is 45 years old and located on \nBMC land, and there have been state provided toilets in the area for most of that time.  \nToday, there is up to 1000 people in the settlement.  Most people work on daily wages, \nand most of the women who work do so by cleaning houses. The male-dominated \nstructure of previous community organising has been maintained through a new CBO \nestablished for the SSP, and has resulted in extra provisions for men over women, \nincluding individual taps in male toilets and extra seats.   \n \nThe CBO approached the MSDP in 2002 following initial contact from SPARC.  \nFollowing a feasibility study by an engineer, a two-floor structure of 12 seats was \nrecommended (later, an extra two seats were added to the gents, in addition to the 10 \nor so urinals already there), and one of the old blocks with six seats was refurbished.  \nThe ratio of seats to people is 1:55, eased slightly for men with the additional two \nseats they built.  Local people said that queues are not as long as before (when it could \nbe over an hour of waiting) and that during busy times of the day, the queues average \njust two or three per seat.   \n \n 32 \nEveryday, a private tanker comes to supplement water supply to the blocks.  There are \nthree caretakers in total, and the toilets are cleaned twice per day.  The CBO obtains \nRs. 120 per family per year, varying between Rs. 10 and Rs. 20 per month per family, \nand up to Rs. 50 from larger families.  Family passes were issued in the beginning as \nper SSP guidelines.  Hundreds of outsiders use the toilet every day (the block is near a \nbusy road), from 6am until midnight, and are charged Rs. 2 per person.  The \ncommittee are volunteers and do not get paid, and they have applied for an income tax \nexemption because the CBO is a registered charity.  In addition, there are activities \nattached to the large block.  For example, 200 students from around the area attend \nbasic computer classes on the second floor, including poor and middle-class groups.  \nIndividuals are charged Rs. 750 for the three-month class.  Yet, the president insisted \nthat the block runs at a loss.  He pointed to the electricity bill - the bill was over two \nmonths (the first month hadn\u201ft been paid), from November to January 2006, and the \ntotal was Rs. 6540.  The committee claimed it was too high, especially when added to \nwater charges, sewer line charges and maintenance costs.   \n \nWhile I did not have access to the details of these accounts, it is unlikely that the \nincome generated cannot meet these costs.  During the course of research, various \nreliable sources, from independent commentators to state officials, claimed that there \nare cases of local CBOs \u2013 or more correctly those who run CBOs - making an \nundeclared profit from toilet blocks, particularly those blocks located near busy roads \nwhere outside passers-by often pay to use.  A lack of accountability makes this \ndifficult to corroborate.  However, in interviews with people in Khotiwadi, it became \nclear that not only were people happy to pay towards toilet blocks, most did not care if \nundeclared profits were being made provided that the service is affordable and well \n 33 \nrun.  People would often begin by contrasting the new with the old blocks.  One older \ncouple said that the old blocks were unclean and often blocked, and that there were \noften queues of up to 30 people at busy times because of a lack of seats.  They didn\u201ft \npay for maintenance of those blocks, and while they now pay Rs. 10 every month \neach, the blocks are kept clean and are without blockages.  They said that as far they \nknow, the money was going to cleaning only, adding: \u201cWhy should we bother with \ntheir [the committee\u201fs] business?...We are getting it cheaply.  They are doing good, so \nwhy should we bother with them?\u201d  Their view was that given that toilets were \npreviously in a very poor condition, they wouldn\u201ft care if funds were going missing as \nlong as the blocks are well maintained.  \n \nThis view was shared by others.  One family, where the father works for the Bombay \nPort Trust as a marine engineer driver earning a relatively high Rs 20,000 per month, \npay a flat Rs 120 per year towards maintenance, and do not give the costs any more \nthought as long as maintenance is effective.  Again, they emphasised the contrast with \nthe past, where women might queue from 6am to 8am to use dirty toilets.  Often, \npeople would defecate in any sheltered ground around the settlement.  Now, caretakers \nclean daily, and they are pleased with the results, adding that the area where the new \nblock is located was previously a garbage area.  They said they are not interested \nwhere the money is going, as long as the blocks are kept clean.  They had never seen \nany accounts, but added that have had positive contact with the committee members, \nmany of whom they know as neighbours.  They have found the committee responsive \nto minor requests, ranging from complaints about graffiti to broken buckets.  \n \nThe SSP initiative at Khotiwadi has become a flagship for the SSP, and it has \n 34 \ngenerated a great deal of interest.  The visitor book is filled with praiseworthy \ncomments from policy-makers and donor organisations from across the world.  People \nare content to pay contributions for an improved service.  If there are questions about \nthe use of funds, locals are generally not interested in them.  Khotiwadi is an \nestablished, authorised informal settlement made up of relatively well off families \nliving in pukka (concrete) housing.  How sustainable is cost-recovery in different parts \nof the city where families are less well off?  What is the pattern of use in those areas?  \nAny temptation to conclude that cost recovery is a workable solution for cash-\nscrapped municipal governments must take into account the nature of cost recovery as \nit operates in a variety of different urban contexts. \n \nFor example, Rafi Nagar in Govandi, is one of the poorest unauthorised informal \nsettlements in the city.  The settlement is located on BMC land and is subject to \nfrequent bouts of demolition, never with any offer of resettlement and rarely with \nwarning.  The housing in the area is constituted through tin, corrugated iron and \nplastic, and employment is mostly informal.  Many people \u201eragpick\u201f on the dumping \nground next to which the settlement is based, earning between Rs. 30 and Rs. 50 per \nday.  This includes children, who sometimes don\u201ft get paid at all, none of whom attend \nschool.  Many of the women previously worked in dance bars before the bars were \nbanned by the state government, since which some of have entered prostitution. The \npeople in this settlement suffer major health problems \u2013 the settlement is severely \nunhygienic, and the dumping ground is literally on their doorstep.  TB, HIV\/AIDS, \nmalaria, anemia, malnutrition, asthma and bronchitis in part due to fumes from the \ndumping ground, and intestinal illnesses, are all very common.  There are two SSP \nblocks in the area.  Each has 12 male and 12 female seats.  People who pay \n 35 \nmaintenance have a \u201efamily pass\u201f and pay Rs. 10 per adult per month, otherwise it\u201fs \nRs. 1 per use.  These are the only blocks in an area of 20,000 people, and there are no \nplans for new blocks.   \n \nMost of the relatively wealthier individuals in the area use the blocks, and they are \nwell maintained by local caretakers despite the pressure of use.  Water and sanitation \nconstitutes the biggest monthly outlays for many people, not to mention the costs spent \non health problems caused by the inadequacy of these basic requirements.  In practice, \nwhile the blocks are in good maintenance, the combination of cost and long queues \nmeans that most people do not use them and instead use the nearby dumping ground.  \nIn Rafi Nagar, attempts to \u201eclean\u201f the settlement veer between violence (demolition) \nand regulation (SSP blocks), between the legal and illegal.  Public health is very poor \nand toilet facilities are either insufficient or makeshift and dangerous dumping \ngrounds.  In this context, we are forced to ask whether people who can barely afford \nsanitation but yet desperately seek it, to not just \u201edemand\u201f it, as the SSP guidelines \ninsist, but to demand to pay for it, constitutes a logical development strategy. \n \nPeople in this context are often more concerned about how their contributions are \nbeing used than those living in Khotiwadi, and many complained about having to pay \nfrom very low budgets.  In this context, the SSP is a very partial sanitation solution, \nand in practice cost recovery can remove the option.  In addition, in the many areas \nthroughout the city where the blocks are poorly maintained despite high-levels of \ncontributions from locals and outsiders, local tensions can result or become \nexacerbated.  It is perhaps only in settlements like Khotiwadi, relatively well off with \nlow pressure on well-maintained toilet blocks, that people are content with paying and \n 36 \nhave the luxury of being unconcerned about the use of funds.  In addition, there are \nquestions around who should and who should not be made to pay for use.  For \nexample, SSP rules mean that labourers who work in settlements but do not live there \ncannot be issued with family passes, and instead must pay per use.    \n \nAccording to research carried out by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) as the \nSSP was launched, most people living in informal settlements expect sanitation \ndelivery to be, as it has often been, free (Tata, 1998).  The shift from paying for toilets \nthrough votes to paying through cash is a shift that can lead to the marginalisation of \npoorer people.  I am not arguing here that a system of cost-recovery should necessarily \nbe abandoned in Mumbai, but that the realities of specific settlements need to be taken \ninto account.  In order to reach higher numbers, many settlements or parts of \nsettlements could require full subsidies.  Just as difficulties with the policy and \ntechnical infrastructures in the SSP suggest that greater flexibility is required in order \nto reflect the plurality of the informal settlements in the city, the case of Rafi Nagar \nsuggests that flexibility in the administration of costs and subsidies may be necessary. \n  \nConclusion \n \nMost people care little about who is maintaining blocks as long as they are being \nmaintained, whether it is a political party, BMC staff, or a local CBO.  As long as \nblocks are, first, well maintained, second, of adequate number, and, third, affordable, \nthen on the whole people use them with few complaints.  In one settlement in the \nwestern suburb of Bandra, for example, people said that they were not concerned that \nthe (non-SSP) blocks were maintained by the Congress Party, as long as they were \n 37 \nkept in the condition they were in.  One advantage to the SSP, however, is that it offers \nthe potential to deliver a service outside of the patronage politics between politician or \nparty and informal settlement, although in practice parties often play a role.  However, \nwhile there has been significant improvement in sanitation delivery, getting all three of \nthese factors to work together is a huge challenge.  Without being prescriptive, the \nissues raised here tentatively suggest that a greater flexibility in the SSP may be \nrequired in order to reflect the varied geographies of informal settlements, the ordinary \nspaces of urban development.  It is hoped that these reflections contribute to debate on \nthe programme. \n \nFirst, the discussion of partnership and participation indicates that flexibility could \nallow a more plural policy infrastructure.  The SSP could usefully make its tendering \nprocess more flexible to enable smaller NGOs to bid for smaller contracts, rather than \nsimply favouring large contracts and NGOs.  This could make space for smaller \norganisations with a greater familiarity with particular settlements, and that are not \ndivisively associated with particular groups, to use their local expertise to extend \nparticipation and maximise the sanitation needs of these settlements.  The presence of \nlarge \u201esuper NGOs\u201f on the political map of the city leaves little space for smaller \norganisations that may have demonstrated capacities for specific aspects of \ndevelopment, from publicity to construction to working with communities.  In \naddition, in the case of SPARC, an organisation that has increasingly come to stand for \n\u201ecivil society\u201f in urban development projects in Mumbai, its liberal entrepreneurial \npolitics are more likely to accommodate the agendas of realpolitik than to contest them \nwith radical politics (McFarlane, 20004).  This reduces the space for other civil society \ngroups to influence the direction of policy and public debate.  Second, the discussion \n 38 \nof technical infrastructure production indicates that the programme could usefully be \nmore driven around the needs, constitution and geography of specific settlements.  \nThis could result in more effective results over the long term, including individual, \ntwin and shared toilets rather than simply large common blocks.   \n \nThird, the discussion of cost recovery suggests caution.  In particular, there may be a \nrequirement for full subsidies in areas that clearly cannot afford to spare money (as in \nthe case of Rafi Nagar) if sanitation delivery is to reach poorer groups.  In addition, it \nis worth considering more effective monitoring of how contributions are being used \nlocally, as well as more general monitoring of user and non-user views on sanitation.  \nLarge \u201esuper NGOs\u201f do not necessarily bring accountability anymore than they \nnecessarily contribute a fuller understanding of community needs.  While the SSP, in \ncontrast to Mehta\u201fs bleak prediction, has significantly improved sanitation in informal \nsettlements, the issues raised here suggest that the programme could be more effective \nif it was based on a greater engagement with local people.   \n \nThe SSP distinguishes itself from the previous ad hoc model of sanitation provision \nthat Chatterjee (2004) describes in that it is a citywide, long-term project to improve \ninformal settlements.  Its emphasis on community responsibility marks a shift from his \nnotion of intervention in \u201eslums\u201f as a calibration of rewards and costs towards a \nconstruct of citizenship rights and responsibilities.  The SSP is in part an attempt to \nfoster a particular kind of civic consciousness of community responsibility deemed \nlacking among those living in informal settlements.  To this extent it is an attempt to \ninstil a particular sense of urban modernity which echoes nationalist discourses in the \nearly years of Independence (Chakrabarty, 2002).  However, in this construction, the \n 39 \n\u201enonbourgeoise subaltern\u201f is, in Chakrabarty\u201fs (2002: 69) phrasing, \u201calways already \ncondemned\u201d.  The subaltern is condemned as lacking the sense of civic consciousness \nviewed as integral to the making of a modern city: the view peddled in the media and \namong many neighbourhood improvement groups is often that it is their fault that \nsanitation is the way it is, and if things don\u201ft improve then it is they who are to blame.  \nFor example, some BMC officials complained that one of the reasons for health \nproblems among the poor is a lack of \u201cdiscipline\u201d, or the wrong \u201cmentality\u201d.  These \nperceptions often act as an explanation for emerging shortcomings in \u201ecommunity\u201f \nmaintenance.  In this act of condemnation, the \u201eslum\u201f remains fixed to the terrain of \n\u201epopulation\u201f, without any inherent moral claim on the state.  \u201eSlums\u201f remain \npopulations outside of the sphere of citizenship, outside of discourses of rights, and \nremain in the view of these officials and many others in the city a necessary scourge \non visions of the modern, clean and ordered city.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 40 \nReferences \nAlimuddin S., Hasan A, and Sadiq, A. 2004 \u201eThe Work of the Anjuman Samaji \nBehbood in Faisalabad, Pakistan\u201f.
