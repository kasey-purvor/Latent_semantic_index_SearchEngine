During the Neoproterozoic, severe \u201cSnowball\u201d 22 \nglaciations would have had an extreme impact on the biosphere and the atmosphere. 23 \nHere, we report that sulfate extracted from carbonate lenses within a 24 \nNeoproterozoic glacial diamictite suite from Svalbard, with an age of ~ 635 Ma, falls 25 \nwell outside the currently known natural range of triple oxygen isotope 26 \ncompositions, and indicates that the atmosphere had either an exceptionally high 27 \natmospheric CO2 concentrations or an utterly unfamiliar O2 cycle during deposition 28 \nof the diamictites.  29 \n 2 \nTerrestrial sulfate (SO4\n-2\n) has diverse origins and participates in many important 30 \nphysicochemical and biological processes that can be inferred from large ranges in stable 31 \nsulfur and oxygen isotope compositions (1). The \u03b418O (2) of sulfate ranges from ~+8\u2030 to 32 \n~+27\u2030 (VSMOW) (3) for marine sulfate of different geological ages (4) and down to 33 \n~\u221218\u2030 for sulfate formed in continental Antarctica (5). In recent years, the sulfate 34 \noxygen isotope composition has been found to vary along another dimension, the \u220617O [\u2261 35 \nln (\u03b417O+1) \u2212 0.52ln (\u03b418O+1)]. The \u220617O is close to zero for most samples, but positive 36 \n(up to ~+5.94\u2030) for those of atmospheric origin (6, 7). Most recently, small but negative 37 \n\u220617O values have been reported for sulfate derived from oxidative weathering by 38 \natmospheric oxygen, with a conspicuous spike (down to \u22120.70\u2030) in the immediate 39 \naftermath of a Marinoan glaciation at ~ 635 Myrs ago (8). Here we report that these 40 \nranges are surpassed dramatically by carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) extracted from a 41 \nNeoproterozoic Marinoan (9, 10) carbonate unit from Svalbard, Arctic Ocean. This 42 \ncarbonate member (W2) is from the Wilsonbreen Formation (Polarisbreen Group), a 43 \nformation dominated by diamictites representing a continental-scale glaciation (ref. 9, 11). 44 \nW2 contains both limestones and primary dolostones with exceptionally preserved 45 \ngeochemistry (12). We have greatly extended the previous geochemical database, 46 \nincluding isotope compositions of CAS (13) (Fig. S1, Table S1). Note that the \u201ccap 47 \ncarbonate\u201d, the lower Dracoisen Formation, is ~ 80 m above W2, and is not the subject of 48 \nthis study. 49 \nTwo features of the dataset are exceptional in terms of what we know about sulfate 50 \non Earth (Fig. 1): 1) The \u220617OCAS reaches as low as \u22121.64\u2030, the most negative anomaly 51 \never reported for terrestrial (vs. extraterrestrial) minerals; 2) The \u03b418OCAS reaches as high 52 \n 3 \nas ~ +37.7\u2030, the most positive value ever reported for natural sulfate oxygen. Additional 53 \nfeatures are also intriguing. For example: 3) CAS with a distinct \n17\nO anomaly is 54 \ninvariably from a limestone phase whilst CAS from the dolostone phase does not have 55 \nsuch a distinct \n17\nO anomaly (Fig. 1); 4) Amongst CAS from the limestones, there is a 56 \nstrong positive correlation in \u220617O\u2212\u03b434S space and the trend line connects with CAS from 57 \nthe immediately pre-glacial dolostone (member E4) (Fig. 1b); 5) The positively 58 \ncorrelated \u03b418O and \u03b413C of dolomite ranges from ~\u221211\u2030 to +15\u2030 (VPDB) (3) and from 59 \n~\u22122 to +5\u2030 (VPDB) respectively. This \u03b418OCO3 is the most positive value ever reported 60 \n(Fig. 2a); 6) Excluding pre-glacial samples, a slope of ~ 1 links two clusters of data in 61 \n\u03b418OCAS \u2212 \u03b4\n18\nOCO3 space (Fig. 3); and 7) those calcite samples with negative \u2206\n17\nOCAS 62 \nhave a \u220617OCO3 value close to zero, indicating the evaporated water itself did not bear a 63 \n17\nO anomaly (Table S1). 64 \nWe propose the following model to account for this unusual carbonate paragenesis. 65 \nThe environment consisted of lacustrine oases within a continental ice sheet. The lakes 66 \nwere dominantly suboxic and, where local meltwater inflow was low, they and their near-67 \nsurface porewaters were driven to high salinities by extreme evaporation, accompanied 68 \nby intense microbial sulfate redox reactions. Sulfate with negative \u220617O values was 69 \nproduced by oxidative weathering involving atmospheric O2 on the land surface, and was 70 \nwashed into the lakes, along with pre-existing sulfate in rocks undergoing weathering. 71 \nThis mixed sulfate was reduced to sulfides (H2S or HS\n\u2212\n) by bacteria and subsequently 72 \nreoxidized to sulfate by a different microbial community in an oxic to suboxic condition. 73 \nThe re-oxidation was highly efficient, thus causing sulfur isotope mass-balance and 74 \nresulting in a change in the \u03b434SSO4 much smaller than in the corresponding \u03b4\n18\nOSO4 or 75 \n 4 \n\u03b418OCO3 value (which should be heavily influenced by the changing \u03b4\n18\nOH2O due to 76 \nvariable degrees of evaporation). No atmospheric O2 signal was incorporated into the 77 \nnewly regenerated sulfate in the water column, as abundant Mn and Fe (Table S1) would 78 \nshuttle electrons between sulfite and dissolved O2 in ambient solution (14-16) without 79 \ndirect contact between reduced sulfur species and O2. Such redox cycling effectively 80 \neliminated the initial sulfate \n17\nO\u2013anomalous oxygen and replaced it with 17O\u2013normal 81 \noxygen from the ambient water during the precipitation of dolostones. The sulfate in 82 \nlimestones however appears not to have been subjected to such intense redox cycling, 83 \nthus enabling them to retain their \n17\nO-anomalous signature. Intensive evaporation 84 \nresulted in highly positive \u03b418O values for the remaining water in a restricted lake or 85 \nbasin. Carbonate formed in the water would also therefore carry extremely positive \u03b418O 86 \nvalues. Both the dolomite mineralogy and the ranges of \u03b413CCO3 and \u03b4\n18\nOCO3 (displaying 87 \nheavier-than-marine values) are characteristic of restricted evaporitic settings (17). 88 \nThe evaporative dolomite-precipitating environments are evidence of microbial 89 \nactivity because they contain microbial laminites (12) and due to the intense redox 90 \ncycling required to explain both the extremely high \u03b418OCAS values and the disappearance 91 \nof the negative \n17\nO anomalies in these dolomites. As \u03b418OCAS increases at the same 92 \nmagnitude as \u03b418OCO3 (Fig. 3), this suggests that almost all the oxygen in the sulfate was 93 \nreplaced by oxygen from ambient water after microbially-mediated sulfur redox cycling. 94 \nThe highly positive \u03b418OSO4 (up to +37.7\u2030) therefore should be correlated with the 95 \nhighly positive \u03b418OH2O in the lakes. The \u03b4\n18\nO of evaporated H2O can be estimated from 96 \nthe highly positive \u03b418Odolomite, which is unlikely the result of late alteration. Taking into 97 \naccount the uncertainties in precipitation temperature, precipitation kinetics, and 98 \n 5 \ndiagenetic imprint, we estimate (from Fig. 3) a difference between \u03b418OCAS and \u03b4\n18\nOH2O 99 \nranging from ~20\u2030 to 30\u2030, which is similar to the ~ 25\u2030 to 30\u2030 recently obtained 100 \nfrom an experimental studies of sulfate reduction (18). We know of no other 101 \nenvironments where the microbial sulfate redox cycling has reached a complete steady 102 \nstate with highly evaporitic ambient water. The closest analog is modern hypersaline 103 \nlagoons near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where the \u03b418OSO4 reaches +21.3\u2030 in pore waters 104 \nand +20.8\u2030 in surface brines with an apparent \u2206\u03b418OSO4\u2212H2O at ~+20\u2030 (19). 105 \nThe most negative value of \u220617OSO4 (\u22121.64\u2030) extends greatly the magnitude and 106 \ngeographic occurrence of the negative \u220617OSO4 following the Marinoan glaciation as first 107 \nreported in Bao et al. (8). Bao et al proposed the negative \u220617O was derived from that of 108 \natmospheric O2 involved in the oxidative weathering of sulfur compounds on the surface 109 \nof the Earth (8). Pre-existing ocean sulfate may not have a distinct negative \u220617O value 110 \nbecause continuous microbial sulfur redox cycling tends to replace sulfate oxygen with a 111 \nwater oxygen signal. Thus, sulfate in a restricted continental basin could have the most 112 \nnegative \u220617OSO4 where a significant portion of the sulfate was derived from non-marine 113 \nsources. The value \u22121.64\u2030 is more than twice the magnitude of the \u22120.70\u2030 reported for 114 \nbarites from Marinoan cap carbonates from South China (8). This is consistent with W2\u201fs 115 \nsetting, where much if not all the drainage could have been internal.  116 \nWe interpret the strong correlation between \u220617OCAS and \u03b4\n34\nSCAS in limestones (data 117 \nfeature 4, Fig. 1b) as a mixing line between two sulfate endmembers: a pre-existing 118 \nmarine sulfate and a sulfate newly supplied from continental weathering, rather than an 119 \nevaporative trend for an already mixed sulfate in the lakes. This can be justified because 120 \nof the absence of evaporative characteristics in the limestones and their much narrower 121 \n 6 \nscatter of \u03b418O value (from \u221213\u2030 to \u22124\u2030VPDB) (Fig. 2b, Fig. 3) compared with that of 122 \nthe evaporative dolomites (from \u221211\u2030 to +15\u2030VPDB) (Fig. 2a). The \u201cmixing\u201d scenario 123 \nis also supported by the isotope compositions of CAS in the pre-glacial carbonates, which 124 \nfall close to the \n34\nS-high end of the line (Fig. 1b). Since sulfate evaporite relics are 125 \nknown to occur in the underlying E4 tidal-flat carbonates (20) it is likely that weathering 126 \nof coeval nodular or bedded sulfate from lateral equivalents of E4 helped stabilize the 127 \nposition of the mixing line.  128 \nIf sulfate derived from oxidative weathering of sulfides in glacial rock flour had a 129 \nglobal average crustal \u03b434S value of ~ 0\u2030, the mixing line (Fig. 1b) would point to a 130 \n\u220617O of ~\u22124.2\u2030 for the non-marine sulfate endmember. This would imply an 131 \natmospheric \u220617O(O2) at ~ \u221242\u2030 if only 10% of the oxygen in sulfate came from 132 \natmospheric O2 (8). This estimate contains two large uncertainties \u2212 the end-member 133 \n\u03b434Ssulfides value and the fraction of sulfate oxygen derived from atmospheric O2 \u2212 and is 134 \nlikely the most negative bound. If the non-marine sulfate endmember had a \u03b434S of ~ 135 \n+18\u2030, as seen near the low end of the data array (Fig. 1b), the atmospheric \u220617O(O2) 136 \nwould be ~ \u22126.6\u2030 assuming 1\/4 of the oxygen in sulfate (a probable maximum) came 137 \nfrom atmospheric O2 during surface sulfide oxidation (16, 21). A realistic \u2206\n17\nO(O2) value 138 \nprobably lies somewhere between \u221242\u2030 and \u22126.6\u2030 at the time of W2 deposition. Note 139 \nthat the modern \u220617O(O2) is only ~ \u22120.10 to \u22120.20\u2030 depending on reference slope value 140 \n(ln\n17\n\/ln\n18\n) used for calculation (22, 23). 141 \nThere may be alternative scenarios where a large negative \u220617O(O2) could occur 142 \nmathematically, although geologically there are far fewer scenarios that are viable. The 143 \nmagnitude of the negative \u220617O value of atmospheric O2 is determined by parameters 144 \n 7 \nsuch as stratosphere O3-CO2-O2 reactions, the size of the atmospheric O2 and CO2 145 \nreservoirs, stratosphere-troposphere flux, and troposphere O2 fluxes (8). The controlling 146 \nparameters are often hard to determine, especially for an unfamiliar Earth system, but 147 \nsome constraints exist. Other things being equal, higher CO2 concentrations lead to a 148 \nmore negative \u220617O(O2) value as the CO2 develops a positive anomaly by exchange with 149 \noxygen. Assuming a steady-state O2 reservoir and modern gas fluxes, the 1-D model in 150 \nBao et al (8) would predict a pCO2 level of ~12,500 to ~ 80,000 ppm during W2 151 \ndeposition, consistent with the Earth having gone through a prolonged,  ice-covered 152 \nperiod, i.e. a \u201esnowball\u201f Earth (24). It should be noted that a much lower pO2 and a 153 \nmoderately high pCO2 also could produce a similarly negative \u2206\n17\nO(O2), but only if the 154 \ncorresponding O2 residence time (i.e. pO2\/flux) were disproportionally long. Prolongation 155 \nof the residence time whilst keeping oxygen concentrations low implies much lower rates 156 \nof both O2 removal by respiration\/decomposition and input by photosynthesis, a balance 157 \nthat is consistent with near-global glaciations. Other non-steady-state scenarios can also 158 \nbe imagined where bizarre combinations of changes in reservoirs and fluxes of 159 \natmospheric O2 and CO2 could have resulted in the observed large negative \u2206\n17\nO(O2) in 160 \ncertain time windows. These scenarios could be explored by combining models and 161 \nfurther empirical data, but geology offers a stronger constraint since circumstances under 162 \nwhich sulfate can be preserved in terrestrial sedimentary records are uncommon.  163 \nAlthough various aspects of Neoproterozoic glaciations are intensely disputed (25), 164 \nour results confirm a profound difference from Phanerozoic ice ages. A near-global 165 \ndistribution of glaciated continents during a \u201eMarinoan\u201f phase ending 635-630 Myr ago is 166 \nsupported by evidence of low palaeomagnetic latitudes (26). The \u201esnowball\u201f Earth model 167 \n 8 \n(27) predicts a progressive accumulation of volcanic volatiles in the atmosphere which 168 \nare not removed by weathering until the rapid demise of the ice age as the ice-albedo 169 \nfeedback reverses. If sulfate with large negative \u220617O signals derived from oxidative 170 \nweathering could only be generated in significant quantity after melting of the \u201csnowball\u201d 171 \nand exposure of continents, then the diamictites above W2 had to be deposited during 172 \nfinal glacial retreat, a hypothesis that should prompt a re-examination of their 173 \nsedimentology. The alternative \u201cslushball\u201d model, in which parts of the ocean area are 174 \nice-free (28), would also permit accumulation of sulfate from prolonged oxidative 175 \nweathering in certain continental \u201coases\u201d where arid but cold conditions prevailed. This 176 \nstudy provides an effective way to study the dynamics of sedimentation and atmospheric-177 \nhydrosphere-biosphere interactions during a global glaciation and highlights the need for 178 \nfurther stratigraphically constrained \u220617OSO4 data on continental carbonate precipitates to 179 \nground-truth flux-balance models. 180 \n 181 \n 9 \n References and Notes 182 \n1.
