The behavioural and polysomnographic studies \nreported by McKenna, Mosko, and colleagues throughout the nineties supported the logical \nconclusion derived from physiological, evolutionary, historical, psychological and cross-\ncultural data, that sleeping in close proximity to its mother ought to be in an infant\u2019s best \ninterests. \n \nA range of studies have demonstrated the benefits of prolonged intimate interaction (skin-to-\nskin contact, kangaroo care) between mother and infant in the immediate post-natal period, \nhelping infants recover rapidly from birth-related fatigue (Ludington-Hoe, 1999), encouraging \nspontaneous breastfeeding (Gomez Papi, 1998), promoting continued breastfeeding (De \nChateau 1977), helping newborns preserve energy and accelerating metabolic adaptation, \nand thus increasing the well being of the newborn infant (Christensson et al. 1992).  Skin-to-\nskin contact is also associated with a significant increase in maternal oxytocin levels \n(Matthiesen, 2001; Nissen, 1995) with significance for uterine contraction, milk ejection, and \nmother-infant interaction; and with less maternal anxiety and more efficient participation of \nmothers in caring for their newborn infants (Vial-Courmont 2000). These studies demonstrate \nthe physiological importance of mother-infant physical contact on infant development and \nmother-infant well-being and draw attention to the evolved interactive nature of the post-\npartum period. Mother-infant sleep contact over the first few months of life is a logical \nextension of post-partum skin-to-skin or kangaroo care with consequences for the \ndevelopment of infant sleep biology, and maternal feeding physiology (Ball 2003; McKenna \nand McDade 2005). \n 4\n In Euro-American society, co-sleeping is often synonymous with bed-sharing -- i.e. parent(s) \nand infant sharing an adult bed for sleep -- although co-sleeping refers to a broader \nphenomenon of mother-infant sleep contact involving physical presence and sensory \ninterchange \u2013 but does not necessitate sleeping on a \u2018western\u2019 style bed, or even on the \nsame sleep surface (McKenna and Mosko 2001). Bed-sharing as practiced in the UK and US is \ntherefore one form of mother-infant co-sleeping \u2013 and one that has attracted much \ncontroversy, being implicated in both accidental infant deaths and SIDS in various controlled \nand uncontrolled studies of sudden and unexpected infant deaths ( Byard 1994; Carpenter, \net al. 2004; Drago and Dannenberg 1999; Mitchell and Scragg 1993; Nakamura, Wind et al. \n1999). So while close mother-infant contact at night appears to be evolutionarily and \nphysiologically adaptive \u2013 it has been argued that western bedding and sleeping \narrangements may not be.  Uncontrolled studies (such as those based on the data from the \nUS Consumer Product Safety Commission, e.g. Drago and Dannenberg (1999); Nakamura, \nWind et al. (1999)) tell us little about the relative risks and benefits of various sleeping \narrangements for infants.  Case-control studies (e.g. Blair et al 1999; Carpenter et al 2004; \nTappin et al 2005) are expected to be more rigorous, however to date case-control studies \nexamining SIDS and infant sleep safety have produced conflicting results regarding bed-\nsharing, and almost all such studies have failed to match cases and controls on the basis of \nbehavioural variables such as feeding choice, parental alcohol and drug consumption , and \nfrequency or type of bed-sharing and emphasise the matching of infants on socio-\ndemographic variables and the location of their \u2018last\u2019 or \u2018reference\u2019 sleep. \n \nWe have previously reported on the effects of breast vs. formula feeding upon infant sleep \ncharacteristics and the propensity to bed-share (Ball 2003).  In this paper we present the \nresults of a study investigating how behavioural variables such as feeding choice and partner \npresence in the bed may affect mother-infant sleep behaviour and therefore infant sleep \nsafety.  Comparison is made with the detailed observations of mother-infant bed-sharing \n 5\nbehaviour from McKenna and Mosko\u2019s studies of breastfeeding Latina mothers and their \nbabies (McKenna 1990; McKenna and Mosko 1994; McKenna, et al. 1997; Mosko et al. 1996; \nMosko, et al. 1997a; Mosko et al. 1997b; Mosko et al. 1997c; Richard et al. 1997). These studies \nwere conducted in a hospital sleep lab in California using polysomnographic monitoring and \nvideo observations of both mothers and infants sleeping together in a narrow hospital bed.  \nMother-infant dyads who normally bed-shared and breastfed were found to sleep in close \nproximity with a high degree of mutual orientation and arousal overlap. When bed-sharing, \nmothers placed infants in the supine position for sleep and infants breast-fed more, and cried \nless, than on nights when they slept apart from their mothers.  Because of the confines of the \nnarrow hospital bed in which mothers and infants slept, however, it was unclear whether the \norientation, proximity, arousal, and breastfeeding frequencies reported were artefacts of \nsleeping in artificially cramped conditions \u2013 or an innate feature of normal bed-sharing for \nbreastfeeding mothers and infants.   \n \nA study conducted in Bristol UK, addressed some of these issues.  Young (Young 1999) \nexamined mother-infant bed-sharing in a hospital sleep lab designed to resemble a domestic \nbedroom.  Mothers and infants bed-shared in a full-size double bed, and were recorded via \ninfra-red video, with infants being monitored polysomnographically.  In terms of close \nproximity, mutual orientation, supine infant sleeping position, sleep state concordance, and \nbreastfeeding frequency, these data supported the findings of McKenna and Mosko (Young \n1999). \n \nBoth of the above-mentioned studies observed mothers and breastfed infants only, and did \nso in a hospital environment.  The study reported here was designed to further explore 3 \nareas: \na)  to examine the bed-sharing behaviour of breastfeeding mother-infant pairs in their \nhome environment (dyadic bed-sharing); \nb) to examine the effects of inclusion of fathers in the bed-sharing scenario (triadic \n 6\nbed-sharing); and  \nc) to examine the bed-sharing behaviour of non-breastfeeding mother-infant pairs. \n \nWe report here on all 3 parts of this study.  We hypothesised that because the home \nenvironment was more familiar to both mothers and infants they might sleep more deeply \nand exhibit fewer arousals at home than they had in the previous sleep lab studies. We also \nhypothesised that the presence of fathers bed-sharing with the mother-infant dyad might \naffect proximity and orientation of the infant. We further predicted that fathers\u2019 presence \nmight affect the mothers\u2019 response-time to infant rooting or fussing behaviour, and possibly \nincrease arousals in the mother-infant dyad due to the disturbance caused by an additional \nbed-partner.  Finally, although the behaviour of non-breastfeeding bed-sharers had not been \ndocumented prior to this study, anecdotal evidence had led us to question whether mothers \nwho do not breastfeed their infants bed-share differently from those who breastfeed. We \nhypothesised that the lack of a breast-baby axis of interaction1 (i.e. among mothers who \nhave never breastfed) would extrapolate to differences in bed-sharing compared with \nbreastfeeding mothers.  \n \nMETHODS \nEthics approval was obtained from both the University Ethics Committee, and the Local NHS \nRegional Ethics Committee. \n \nRecruitment \nFamilies with infants, who regularly bed-shared for whole or part nights, were recruited via \nposters in local health clinics and calls for volunteers in the local press, producing a self-\n                                                 \n1 We have observed that mothers who breastfeed carry, cuddle and interact with their infants held at \nbreast-height, whereas mothers who do not breastfeed carry, cuddle and interact with their infants held \nat shoulder\/face height.   We named the primary focus of contact between the mother and the baby \nthe \u2018axis of interaction\u2019. \n 7\ngenerated pool of volunteers from which we selected candidates who matched our \ninclusion criteria: non-smoking mother and father with infants under 6 months of age who \nwere breastfed (for parts a and b of study) and formula fed (for part c of study).  Families who \nmet these criteria were visited at home by one of the research team who further explained \nthe nature of the study, answered parents\u2019 questions, and subsequently obtained parents\u2019 \nsignatures on an informed consent form.  \n \nProcedure \nPrior to video-taping parents were asked to complete a series of sleep logs in order to assess \nthe circumstances of bed-sharing and the degree to which it was practiced in the course of \na normal week. Portable infra-red video equipment was then installed in the families\u2019 homes \nand parents were provided with verbal and written operating instructions.  Parents were \nrequested to begin recording when they went to bed, and to tape until they awoke for the \nmorning, or for the 8-hour duration of the tape, whichever came sooner.  Parents were \nprovided with a remote control with which they could halt the recording at any time during \nthe night.  Families were videoed for an adjustment night (to eliminate \u2018first night effect\u2019 and \nto test the video set-up) and a member of the research team checked the video the \nfollowing morning, adjusting the camera set-up if necessary.  Families were then videoed for 2 \ntest nights in randomly allocated dyadic and triadic bed-sharing configurations. On the \ndyadic night we filmed mothers and infants sleeping together (fathers slept elsewhere), and \non triadic nights we filmed the infant sleeping with both parents.  Following filming parents \nwere offered the opportunity to review their tapes and to erase any portions they desired in \naccordance with Royal College of Physicians guidelines on use of videotaped material (one \nmother erased a 30 second portion). No physiological monitoring occurred. As a gratuity \nparents received a \u00a310 gift voucher for a well-known baby store for each night of filming \ncompleted. \n \nAnalyses \n 8\nA researcher trained in ethological observation techniques coded the videos in real-time. For \neach tape the frequency and duration of certain key behaviours (e.g. breastfeeding) were \ncoded and expressed as a proportion of the total number of hours observed. For state and \npositional behaviours scan samples were coded every 3-minutes throughout the entire night, \nand scan frequencies were calculated as proportions of the total number of scans made, \nallowing within family and between family comparisons to be made. \n \nRESULTS \nTwenty families were videotaped bed-sharing at home with their infants: ten involving \ncurrently breastfeeding mothers and infants and ten involving mothers and infants who had \nnever breastfed.  No significant differences in night-time care-giving parameters were \ndetected from the sleep logs of the breast and formula feeding families. All homes had \ncentral heating, and recordings of the two groups of families were evenly distributed across \nthe year. The socio-demographic characteristics of the families in the two sub-samples are \nshown in Table 1.  Parents of breastfed infants were older than those of formula-fed infants, \nhad experienced slightly more years of education, and had greater household incomes \n(reflecting the current pattern of sociodemographic differences between breastfeeders and \nnon-breastfeeders in the UK (Hamlyn 2002)), however the only difference that reached \nstatistical significance between the two groups was household income. \n \n 9\nFigure L Characteristic sleep position of breast-feeding mothers and infants. \n \n \nMother-infant bed-sharing at home \nData summarised from the video-tapes of the in-home bed-sharing nights for the 10 \nbreastfeeding bed-sharing mother infant dyads are presented in Table 2 alongside data \nreported by Richard et al (Richard, Mosko et al. 1996) on 6 routinely bed-sharing breastfed \ninfants and their mothers who were observed in the California sleep lab, and data reported \nby Young (Young 1999) on 5 routinely bed-sharing breastfed infants and their mothers who \nwere observed in the Bristol sleep lab.   \n \nTABLE 2 HERE \n \nA remarkably consistent picture emerges from these three studies.  Breastfeeding bed-sharing \nmothers slept facing their infants for 71-76% of the night, infants slept facing their mothers for \n87-97% of the night.  Regardless of bed-size mothers and infants slept in close proximity to one \nanother, often touching, but generally no more than 20cm (infant arm-length) apart.  The \nfrequencies of feeding bouts, and total length of feeding were greater in the California sleep \nlab study, than in both the Bristol sleep lab study, and the Durham in-home study, however \nthe infants in the California study were of a younger (and more limited) age-range than the \nUK studies, which may account for the difference.  Infants rarely slept in the prone position \nwhile bed-sharing in all 3 studies. The greatest difference between the Durham in-home study \n 10\nand the Bristol and California Sleep Lab studies involves the proportion of the night infants \nspent in a lateral and supine sleep position.  In the present study bed-sharing breastfeeding \ninfants slept predominantly in a lateral position, whereas in the previous studies infants \npredominantly slept in a supine position.  Our prediction that the home environment would \nbe associated with fewer arousals and less mutual awareness than observed in sleep lab \nstudies was not supported. \n \nInclusion of fathers \nThe effect of the father\u2019s presence in bed with the mother-infant dyad was explored by \ncomparing infant sleep position, mother-infant proximity, orientation and breastfeeding data \nfor the dyadic and triadic sleep nights: \n \nTABLE 3 HERE \n \nAs shown in Table 3 a significant difference was observed regarding the location of the baby \nin the bed. On triadic nights babies were predominantly positioned in the centre of the bed, \nbetween both parents (although one mother exclusively slept her infant on the side of the \nbed on the triadic night), while on dyadic nights most mothers slept in the centre of the bed \nthemselves, and moved the infant from side to side as needed for breastfeeding.  Regarding \nsleep behaviour, mothers faced their infants (on average) for three-quarters of sleep time on \nboth the dyadic and triadic bed-sharing nights, and the amount of time for which infants \nfaced their mothers was no different on the two test nights.  Furthermore infants and mothers \nspent over 70% of both nights in physical contact with one another, and breastfeeding \nactivity was similar on both nights.  Contrary to our prediction the father's presence did not, \ntherefore, alter the characteristic picture of bed-sharing as practised by breastfeeding \nmothers and their infants.  \n \nAlthough breastfeeding mothers slept facing, and in close proximity to their infant, fathers \n 11\ntended to sleep facing away from their infant, and were generally beyond their infant\u2019s \nreach (over 20cm away).  There was one exception, a father who spent 83% of sleep-time \ntouching his infant, who in turn spent 90% of sleep time facing his father.  This father-infant \ndyad spent 53% of sleep time in a face-to-face orientation (compared to 5% between infant \nand mother), however the mother subsequently reported that she had mastitis on the triadic \nsleep night that made sleeping with pressure on the affected breast (facing the centre of the \nbed) uncomfortable.  The behaviour observed in this family therefore was atypical of their \nnormal night-time care-giving practices. \n \nMothers exhibited consistently synchronous arousal patterns with their infant: 9 of 10 mother-\ninfant pairs arousing simultaneously on both dyadic and triadic nights, some pairs doing so up \nto nine times on a single night. Two fathers exhibited 100% synchronous arousals with their \nbed-partners on the triadic night, although the majority of fathers slept through half of their \ninfants\u2019 arousals. Two fathers exhibited no synchrony with the mother-infant pair, never \nshowing any signs of waking on the triadic night.  Synchrony of fathers\u2019 sleep states during \ntriadic bed-sharing therefore appears to be variable and idiosyncratic. \n \nOn both dyadic and triadic nights mothers spent large portions of sleep time in a distinctive \nsleeping posture (Figure 1), spontaneously exhibited by all breastfeeding mothers in this study. \nThese mothers adopted a lateral sleeping position facing their infant, with the mother\u2019s knees \ndrawn up under the infant\u2019s feet, and mother\u2019s upper arm positioned above the infant\u2019s \nhead (either under or on top of the pillow). In contrast most fathers never slept in this position, \nor did so for only short periods of time.  This position clearly facilitated breast-baby contact in \nthese bed-sharing breastfeeding pairs.  That this position also provides several benefits \nrelating to bed-sharing safety is discussed below \n \nFIGURE 1 HERE \n \n 12\nUsing interval sampling we coded the position of bedding and parents' limbs relative to the \ninfant\u2019s body, head and face, and the direction and height of the infant in the bed on both \ndyadic and triadic bed-sharing nights.  We observed no instances, on either dyadic or triadic \nsleep nights, of parents actually or potentially overlaying their infants.  Despite the fact that \nthere were pillows in the bed on all occasions no breastfed infants were observed with their \nface in the pillows, and pillows rarely touched the top of an infant's head -- due mainly to the \ncharacteristic position in which these breastfeeding mothers were observed to sleep.  Cover \nposition on babies was highly variable both from family to family, and between dyadic and \ntriadic nights.  Bed-covers were generally lower on an infant's body when sleeping with the \nmother only, or when sleeping on the outside of the mother on the triadic night, than when \nsleeping between both parents.  However, there was no significant difference in the median \nproportion of scans in which babies had bed-covers over their heads on the dyadic and \ntriadic nights (Table 4), or the median proportion of time babies spent with the covers above \nversus below their waists.   \n \nTABLE 4 HERE \n \nMothers predominantly kept the bed-covers at their own waist-height on the dyadic sleep \nnight, and although covers were higher on the mother when the father was sharing the bed \n(due to fathers keeping the covers at chin height), there was no significant difference in \ncover height on the two nights.  On the dyadic night there was a tendency for infants to \nrotate from a vertical towards a horizontal position in the bed, which was not observed on \nthe triadic night, presumably due to the greater space available in the bed in the father's \nabsence.  That infants spent proportionally less of the dyadic night than the triadic night \nsleeping perpendicular to the headboard was significant. \n \nSome families slept under duvets or comforters, while others used blankets, but all were \nsufficiently flexible that they did not cover the infant's head when they were pulled up under \n 13\nthe parents' chins.  None of the infants videotaped wore more than a stretchy sleepsuit when \nbed-sharing, and none appeared unusually sweaty in the course of either dyadic or triadic \nbed-sharing nights, although without a temperature monitor attached to the infants our \nassessments here are based on limited evidence.   \n \nBehaviour of non-breastfeeding bed-sharing dyads \nVideotapes of 10 families with infants who were not breastfed were analysed as above, and \nour hypothesis that the behaviour of bed-sharing non-breastfeeding mothers and infants \nwould differ from that of breastfeeding dyads was supported.  Table 5 compares the \nbehavioural results for breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding bed-sharers.  Significant \ndifferences were found between the two groups in relation to the proportion of the night \nmothers faced their infants and consequently the proportion of the night mothers and infants \nspent in face-to-face orientation; infant sleeping position (breastfed infants slept \npredominantly on their sides, formula-fed infants slept on their backs); height of infant in bed \nrelative to mother (breastfed infants were at chest height, formula-fed infants were at face \nheight); and feeding and waking frequency (breastfed infants woke and fed more frequently \nthan formula-fed infants). \n \nTABLE 5 HERE \n \nDISCUSSION \nBreastfeeding mother-infant dyads have now been observed displaying the same bed-\nsharing behaviour in 3 separate studies under different conditions suggesting that a robust \npicture of bed-sharing behaviour is emerging.  The finding that a characteristic sleep position \nis consistently adopted by bed-sharing breastfeeding mothers suggests that adoption of this \nsleep position is an instinctive evolved behaviour.  As female great apes are also \ndocumented to adopt this position when sharing sleeping nests with their small infants \n(Goodall 1968) it is possible that this behaviour evolved in the context of infant protection and \n 14\nsafety2.   Human mothers sleeping curled up around their infants in this manner effectively \nprovide a barrier with their upper legs that prevents the baby moving down the bed under \nthe covers.  They also form a barrier with their upper arm above the baby's head, that \nprevents the baby from moving up the bed and into (or under) the mother's pillow(s).  The \nbaby sleeps flat on the mattress (not propped by pillows), either in a lateral or supine \nposition3.  The fact that the mother is curled around her infant means she cannot roll forwards \nonto it, and neither can any other bed-sharers lie on the baby without lying on the mother \nalso.  This position is identical to that described by Mosko et al (1997c); Richard et al (1996), \nand depicted by Young (1999).  \n \nWe examined whether sleeping with both parents involved more hazardous situations for an \ninfant than sleeping with the mother alone.  Despite the fact that there were pillows in the \nbed on all occasions no infants were observed with their face in the pillows, and pillows rarely \ntouched the top of an infant's head -- due to the characteristic position in which these \nbreastfeeding dyads were to sleep.  Potential infant overheating is sometimes cited as a risk \nfactor in triadic bed-sharing due to possible thermal-coupling between two adult bodies \n(Tuffnell et al. 1996).  The observation that most infants spent the vast majority of both nights in \nclose proximity to the mother, with the father at some distance away, suggests that the \npresence of the father in the bed will have a negligible impact on the temperature of the \ninfant -- although size of the bed and parental body size will both be factors affecting this \nrelationship. \n \n                                                 \n2 Several pieces of artwork throughout 19th and 20th centuries have also depicted mothers and infants \nsleeping together in this position e.g.  Elwell\u2019s \u2018The Firstborn\u2019 (Feren\u2019s Art Gallery, Hull, UK), and \nMohderson\u2019s \u2018Mutter mit kind\u2019 (Berlin, Germany) . \n \n3 It is possible that because the babies in the sleep lab studies were wired-up for polysomnographic \nmonitoring the supine position may have been more comfortable, thus affecting sleep position.  \nAlternatively we may have used different criteria to distinguish between lateral and supine positioning. \n \n 15\nA picture emerges of some notable differences in sleeping arrangements between \nbreastfeeding bed-sharing parents and infants and formula-feeding parents and infants.  The \nmost striking of these involve the infant's body position, and his\/her position in the bed.  \nFormula-fed infants predominantly slept supine, while all but one breastfed infant spent the \nmajority of the night sleeping in a lateral position. This significant difference appears to reflect \nthe ease of breastfeeding in the lateral position.  The supine sleeping position is \nrecommended for infants in all western countries due to the increased risk of cot death \namong infants sleeping prone (e.g. AAP 2000; Beal 2000; Dwyer 1996; Esmail et al. 1995; \nFleming et al. 1990; Gibson et al. 2000; Markestad et al. 1995; Scragg, et al. 1996; Willinger et \nal. 2000).  Although recommended in the US until recently, the lateral sleep position has been \ndiscouraged for UK infants for around a decade, as several case-control SIDS studies have \nindicated that sleeping on the side is associated with a greater risk of SIDS than supine sleep \n(Fleming et al. 2000; Scragg and Mitchell 1998; Skadberg et al. 1998; Wigfeld et al. 1992). It \nwould seem, therefore, that when bed-sharing, formula-fed infants are more compliant with \nback-to-sleep guidelines than breastfed infants.  The issue is complicated, however, in that \nepidemiological studies examining sleeping position have not done so in the context of bed-\nsharing.  Several of the above-mentioned authors (e.g. Fleming et al. 2000); Skadberg et al. \n1998; Wigfield, et al. 1992) have noted that infants sleeping alone who are positioned laterally \nmay roll forwards into the prone position (thereby increasing their risk of SIDS), however an \ninfant sleeping in a lateral position next to its mother\u2019s body is unable to roll forwards.  It is \ncurrently unknown whether lateral sleeping in this context is also associated with an increased \nSIDS risk. The relationship between the sleeping position of babies who practice breastfeeding \nrelated bed-sharing and SIDS-risk is therefore a topic that requires further exploration in future \nepidemiological studies. \n \nInfant 'height' in the bed (i.e. closeness to parental faces) also differed significantly between \nbreastfed and formula-fed babies with parents of the latter exhibiting a tendency to place \ntheir infants high in the bed, with infants' faces level with parents' faces, and infants either \n 16\npositioned between, or on top of, the parents' pillows.  Breastfed infants were commonly \npositioned flat on the mattress, below pillow height, level with the mother's chest.  The \npredominant location in the bed for all infants was the middle of the bed, between both \nparents, however breastfed infants also spent time sleeping on the outside of the mother, \nwhile formula-fed infants tended not to be moved around the bed. The changing location of \nthe breastfed infants reflects the fact that some mothers moved their baby to their left or right \nto facilitate feeding from a particular breast.  It was apparent, however that some mothers \nwere able to feed from either breast while remaining in the same position. \n \nAs would be expected (see Ball 2003), feeding frequency and feeding duration differed \nsignificantly between breastfeeding and formula-feeding bed-sharers, the latter feeding on \naverage once per night, while the former fed at least twice, some infants feeding four or \nmore times during the night.  Feeding frequency is related to arousal frequency and arousal \nsynchrony between bed-sharing mothers and infants, with breastfeeding mothers and infants \nexperiencing significantly greater arousal frequencies during the night than formula-feeding \nmothers and infants, together with more synchronous arousals. \n \nFormula-feeding mothers did not have the same degree of orientation towards their infants \nduring sleep as breastfeeding mothers, and spent significantly less time both facing their \ninfant, and in mutual face-to-face orientation, than did breastfeeding mother-infant pairs.   \nThere was no significant difference found in the orientation of fathers to their breast or \nformula-fed infants. \n \nMany of the bed-sharing safety issues discussed above regarding breastfed infants also apply \nto formula-fed infants. However, given the differences in bed-sharing parameters such as \ninfant position and parental orientation between breast and formula-fed infants, it is useful for \ncertain aspects of bed-sharing safety to be considered separately for each group.    \n \n 17\nSeveral of the formula-fed infants were placed with their heads (and shoulders) on their \nparents\u2019 pillows for the majority of the night.  Breastfed infants, on the other hand, were never \nplaced on or near the pillows.  We suggest that mothers of formula-fed infants (particularly \nmothers who have never breastfed) sleep with their infants in the manner of sleeping with \nanother adult (e.g. faces at same height, no consistent \u2018protective\u2019 sleeping position), while \nmothers of breastfed infants sleep with their babies in a more \u2018protective\u2019 manner \u2013 baby \npositioned at breast-level, with mother oriented towards baby in a characteristic position.  \nThe breastfeeding mothers in this study slept with their infants in a safer manner than the non-\nbreastfeeding mothers.  \n \nCovering the face with bed-clothes was an infrequent occurrence for the majority of infants \nin both groups and neither breast nor formula fed babies were more likely to have their heads \ncovered during bed-sharing, despite the fact that the breastfed babies in general slept lower \nin the bed than did the formula-fed babies.   \n \nThese findings illustrate that bed-sharing is not a \u2018generic\u2019 behaviour for all mothers and \ninfants.  The sleep relationship observed (in this and other studies) between breastfeeding \nmothers and infants is qualitatively and quantitatively different from that observed between \nformula-feeding mothers and infants.  The patterning of these differences is consistent with \nour understanding of the physiological mechanisms mediating maternal and infant \nbehaviour, in that breastfeeding mothers experience a hormonal feedback cycle which \npromotes close contact with, heightened responsiveness towards, and bonding with infants in \na way that is missing for mothers who do not breastfeed (Hrdy 1999, Small 1999). Furthermore, \ninfants who are breastfed instinctively orient towards maternal breast odour (Varendi and \nPorter 2001), an instinct which would contribute to the maintenance of the characteristic \nsleeping position observed for breastfeeding mother-infant dyads.  \n \nThese characteristic differences in sleep behaviour when bed-sharing may well affect the \n 18\noutcomes of case-control studies regarding infant safety or SIDS-risk where cases and controls \nare not matched for infant feeding behaviour. The results presented here indicate that not \nonly should cases and controls be matched for variables known to affect bed-sharing \nbehaviour, but that detailed data should also be collected on the manner of bed-sharing by \neach family involved (e.g. infant position in the bed) regarding both their normal practice, \nand on the night in question. \n \nCONCLUSION \nThis study confirms in the home environment the picture of bed-sharing among breastfed \nmother-infant dyads reported in sleep labs by two other research groups. For formula-fed \ninfants we found that the bed-sharing picture is somewhat different due to the lack of a \nbreast-baby orientation during sleep. Principal safety issues regarding bed-sharing relate to \nthe characteristic differences of these two groups \u2013 the danger of accidental suffocation by \nan infant sleeping on or near the parental pillows is cause for concern regarding formula-fed \ninfants, while the tendency of breastfed infant to assume a lateral rather than supine sleep \nposition while bed-sharing might cause concerns regarding the possibly elevated risk of SIDS \nin non-supine sleeping infants.  This issue could be addressed in a case-control study where \nthe cases are matched for feeding behaviour. The father\u2019s presence in the bed did not \nappear to present any universal safety implications for bed-sharing infants, however the fact \nthat there was great individual variation observed in paternal arousability in response to \ninfants during the night would be worthy of further exploration.  An important implication of \nthis study is that epidemiological investigations of the risks of SIDS and accidental deaths in a \nbed-sharing context should include the matching of cases and controls by the feeding \nbehaviour of the infants studied. The results of this study, and an evolutionary-informed \nviewpoint, predict that bed-sharing may be safer for breast-fed than never-breastfed infants. \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \nAAP (2000). \"Task Force on Infant Sleep Position and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: \n 19\nChanging concepts on sudden infant death syndrome: implications for infant sleeping \nenvironment and sleep position.\" Pediatrics 105(3): 650-656. \nBall, H.
