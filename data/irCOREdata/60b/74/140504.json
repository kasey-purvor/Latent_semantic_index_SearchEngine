Introduction\nThe multinational corporation (MNC) and models of MNCs [1] have always been central \nconcepts in international business theory.  Thus, when investigating the future of international \nbusiness, one direction for reflection is the future forms of MNCs and their future economic \nroles.\nBack in the 1980s, in parallel with the business liter ture on globalisation, international \nbusiness theory was promising radical change and the emergence of highly competitive and \nresilient large scale businesses.  Multinational corporations (MNCs) were said to be more \nflexible [1], benefiting from unique economies of scale, economies of scope, learning and real \noptions opportunities [2], and having access to more sources of (cheaper) funds from \ninternational markets [3].  The predictions from these theories of \u201cmultinational advantage\u201d is \nthat MNCs should be naturally more competitive than domestic firms, and that they should \ndominate the realm of economic activities through the management of their knowledge \nreserves, flexibility platforms, and portfolio of real options. Such superiority should naturally be \nreflected in the MNC\u2019s overall value and corporate performance. There is a significant empirical \nliterature in international business research investigating this proposition and the relationship \nbetween multinationality and performance, but it reports mixed and controversial results [4][5].  \nPage 4 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n5\nMost of this research, however, investigates a population of MNCs assumed to be uniform.  If \nthis assumption is relaxed, then the theory of multinational advantage would only hold:\n(1) if MNCs really seek, rather than avoid, strategic flexibility; and\n(2) if flexible MNCs can remain competitive when compared with MNCs using alternative \nstrategies.\nThe specifications of the flexible MNC [1][2] match those of an explorative firm, as described \nby March [6].  March describes exploration as being associated with activities such as \u201csearch, \nvariation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, and innovation\u201d.  Exploitation \nis associated with activities such as \u201crefinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, \nimplementation, execution\u201d [6].  March demonstrates the existence of delicate trade-off \nbetween exploration and exploitation.  He also shows that because adaptive processes refine \nexploitation more rapidly than innovation, organisations naturally tend to exploit rather than \nexplore.  As a result, organisations become very effective in the short-run but do so at the cost \nof compromising or \u201cself-destructing\u201d long run economic prospects. Conversely, a firm investing \nsolely in exploration processes operates at such a level of risk than it would be difficult for it to \nsecure enough short-term returns to fund long-term growth.\nTherefore, if several types of MNCs compete with one another through different strategies, \nthe rather ambivalent nature of the relationship between multinational flexibility and \nperformance in MNCs can be revisited in a different light. Specifically, some firms will tend to \nforego valuable exploration opportunities (e.g. learning and real options) for exploitation \nactivities.  For example, these MNCs could seek growth by replicating their existing business \nPage 5 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n6\nmodels over a broader portfolio of markets, in what could be described as a \u201ccopy and paste\u201d \napproach to strategy. At the other end of the spectrum, one would find MNCs systematically \ninvesting in flexibility and seeking an optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In \nthis work, we assume that managers\u2019 propensity to detect and appraise real options as \nresources and tools for flexibility management in MNCs is one way of differentiating flexible\nMNCs from traditional ones in the current international business landscape  (consistently with\n[1, 2 and 9]). We argue that to appreciate the future of the international business landscape, \none needs to investigate the validity of theories of multinational advantage. Thus our main \nresearch question is: is the flexible multinational a reality or a theoretical fiction? In other \nwords, does the flexible multinational, once the hot topic of i ternational business research, \nhave a future?  Is it able to recognise, explore, and exploit its (flexible) real options platforms? \nFor example, Reuer and Leiblein [7] and Tong and Reuer [8] empirical findings, both focusing on \nreal options as determinants of performance in MNCs, are that multinationality and \ninternational joint-ventures as flexibility options do not necessarily equate with a lower \nexposure to risk or higher performance.\nThis paper is organised as follows.  In the second section, we use empirical data to \ninvestigate whether or not all MNCs are identical when it comes to flexibility.  Our findings \nconfirm the existence of two distinct subpopulations: traditional (non-flexible) MNCs and \nflexible MNCs.  Having established the existence of two competing species of MNCs, we turn to \nthe question of their likely co-existence, in the present and the future.  The third section \ndiscusses our futures methodologies and our choice of a population ecology framework to \nassess the survival likelihood of both species on the basis of their ability to compete for \nPage 6 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n7\nresources.   The fourth section discusses the application of this framework in the case where \ntraditional and flexible multinationals are competing with one another.  The fifth section \nextends this analysis by enlarging the set of species with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) \nand communities of practice (COP).  The sixth section concludes the paper by discussing \nimplications for the future of international business and its role in society.\n2. Multinational Advantage: An Empirical Investigation\n2.1. Background\nThe pioneering theory of Kogut\u2019s [2] multinational advantage has been reinforced with a \nsteady stream of conceptual, normative, and axiomatic research studies about the specific \nparadigm of real options and its implications for flexible MNCs [1][9][10][11]. Most converge \ntoward a model of the multinational enterprise as a rich portfolio of capabilities, which can be \nupdated, adapted, and deployed as opportunities arise. \nThe literature, however, is much thinner when it comes to empirical evidence to validate \nthis view.  When one would expect a steady empirical counterpart of research studies setting \nthemselves to test the mediating role of flexibility between multinationality and performance, \nonly a few papers directly address this issue [7][8][12][13].  In Reuer and Leiblein\u2019s [7] empirical \nstudy for example, results indicate that contrarily to the authors\u2019 expectations, multinationality \nas a platform for real options is not associated with reduced organizational downside risk, \nthereby partly refuting the theory of the flexibility advantages of multinationals.  To confound \nthese negative findings, the literature on real options now includes a stream of critical research \nPage 7 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n8\npositions [14][15][16].  It is within this ongoing debate that this section inscribes itself. It\nempirically contributes to the study of the link between real options thinking, multinationality, \nand performance as a way of validating whether or not all MNCs are identical when it comes to \nflexibility.  \n2.2. Research Framework\nFigure 1 provides a comparative display of the first research objective of this paper in the \ncontext of the multinationality-flexibility-performance debate discussed above. It highlights the \ndistinction between the existence of opportunities (modelled as real options) and the ability of \nmanagement to think flexibly about these opportunities.  This is consistent with research on the \nrole of managerial decision-making in triggering healthy real options flexibility [8][17]. The \nintermediate variable, flexibility management (cf. figure 1), also echoes Kogut\u2019s [2] original call \nfor research regarding the organisational and infrastructural elements enabling firms to benefit \nfrom learning and real options in multinational business environments.  \nIt is important to contrast the research approach used in this paper with the traditional \nmultinational performance debate.  If one posits the existence of variability in terms of \nexploration and exploitation amongst MNCs, empirical investigations of the multinationality-\nperformance link are not trivial.  An exploitative MNC is likely to exhibit performance in the \nshort-run but will have, relatively speaking, a lower exposure to risk than an explorative MNC.   \nThis relative difference is amplified if an exploitative firm is compared to an explorative firm that \noverlooks exploitation.  \n (( Insert figure 1 here))\nPage 8 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n9\nFigure 1 shows that in this paper, a firm\u2019s managerial ability to manage flexibly is assessed \nwith the use of real options, or more generally, with the fact that a firm pays \u201cattention\u201d to real \noptions [18] as a proxy measure. Note however that this paper does not claim that real options \nthinking is the only approach available to acquire a flexibility management capability.  For \nexample, Adner and Levinthal [14] present other management approaches which are available \nto achieve strategic flexibility (e.g. strategic search methods). \nThe aim of this section is to gather empirical evidence to provide an empirical validation of \nthe association between real options attention and performance in order to differentiate \nexplorative firms from exploitative ones. The latter should lack the capability to explore, and \nthus, are likely to ignore real options as a management framework. We also conjecture that \nthese firms have different characteristics with regards to their performance, operations and \nstrategic investments.  Thus, we underline real options attention in firms as a factor \ndifferentiating between traditional MNCs from flexible MNCs.\nThis paper does not argue that the above statement is a law, i.e. that exploitative firms \nnever use nor exercise real options.  For example, an oil company may use a real options \nframework to assess if, and when, a new oil well should be developed.  In this example, the oil \ncompany is using real options valuation as a tool to refine its exploitation activities.  Contrast \nthis example with that of a film manufacturer faced with the emergence of digital cameras: this \ncompany could use real options thinking and valuation to search and discover which strategic \ncourse of action is adequate for its future.  In this second case, real options answer a corporate \nneed for exploring a space of strategic options, and are as such equivalent to scenario planning \nor search mechanisms.  In the former case real options valuation is an optional refinement tool, \nPage 9 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n10\nand thus, is just an analytical technique used within an exploitative strategic environment.  \nAlthough the possible use of real options in an exploitative environment is acknowledged, it is \nconsidered incidental.  On the other hand, we conjecture that real options thinking is a salient \nspecificity of MNCs trying to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.   \nBalancing this trade-off requires the ability of management decision making to frame \ncompetencies and to conduct exploratory searches.  Kogut and Kulatilaka [19] highlight that real \noptions theory is a suitable heuristics to this end.  \nThe key research hypothesis is presented as follows:\nHo: A firm\u2019s attention to real options, and possibly real options thinking, is associated \nwith increased performance.\nIn order to inform our distinction between explorative and exploitative firms, and the \nimpact of multinationality, we further breakdown this hypothesis into:\nH0.a. A firm\u2019s attention to real options, possibly real options thinking, is associated \nwith higher levels of multinationality.\nH0.b. A firm\u2019s attention to real options, possibly real options thinking, is associated \nwith higher levels of R&D activity.\nH0.c. A firm\u2019s attention to real options, possibly real options thinking, is associated \nwith better operating performance.\nH0.d. A firm\u2019s attention to real options, possibly real options thinking, is associated \nwith higher economic performance.\n2.3. Methodology\nPage 10 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n11\nRecent studies conducted by Block [20], Ryan and Ryan [21] and Graham and Harvey [22] \nshow that 10 to 27% (based on the period) of Fortune 1000 companies claim to have used in \nsome way real options analysis in capital budgeting decisions.  There is a variety of accounts of \nreal options adoption by firms.  They are either directly focusing on identifying real options \nusers or potential users [23] or simply confirming the use of the technology in some operations \nand strategic decisions [24][25][26]. We assume that most of the MNCs mentioned in the\n\u201cattention\u201d or \u201cusage\u201d literature are practicing the technology in some way. In other words, \nthese firms can be considered to have used or to be using real options thinking as part of their \nmanagement decisions. Their real options are to be found in international operations, R&D and \nproduction facilities, and should translate into higher performance levels.\n2.3.1. Analytical Method\nA firm\u2019s attention to real options is encoded as a simple dichotomous variable.  No attempt \nis made, however, to identify exact time windows in which options thinking was used.  No \nattempts are made either to try to estimate, for each of these time windows, the corresponding \ntime periods where the lagged effects of the possible use of options thinking will make a \ndifference.  Thus the data used bears limitations.  It is because of these limitations that the \nassociation between real options attention and performance measures is tested through a \uf0632\ntest of association over cross-tabulations.  Rather than test for a specific strength and direction \nof association, cross tabulations are used to identify significant association patterns between \nthe variables, and to interpret these patterns, if any.\n2.3.2. Performance Measures and Related Characteristics\nPage 11 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n12\nThe following four accounting and financial ratios are used as performance and flexibility \nindicators for the selected companies. \nProperty Plant and Equipment Over Assets (PPEOA) \nThis ratio evaluates to which extent a firm efficiently utilises its long term productive assets.  \nIt represents the portion of long term physical operating assets over the total book value of the \nassets of the firm. \nThis ratio measures both the real options potential (a labour intensive company will have a \nlow ratio, and very few real assets with underlying options) and the ability to manage assets \neffectively (an inflexible firm will have a higher ration than a flexible one).\nR&D Expenses Over Assets (R&DOA)\nThis ratio highlights the proportion of R&D incurred costs to company assets. It is \ntraditionally described as an indicator of a company future performance through R&D \ncapabilities and is also a proxy for strategic flexibility.  Explorative firms should have a higher \nR&DOA ration than firms relying on exploitation.\nMultinationality\nMultinationality is set as the number of countries in which the company has international \nsubsidiaries [27]. This indicator measures both the level of foreign investments and the potential \nfor flexibility. Firms with a higher network of international subsidiaries naturally embed more \nreal options in their operations. This variable can also be viewed as indicator of firm \nability\/tendency to operate flexibly (e.g. switching or shifting) if associated with performance.\nPage 12 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n13\nReturn on Assets (ROA)\nIt is the ratio of income to total assets and measures the return on all of the firm\u2019s assets \n[28]. For Bernstein [29], it is the best measure of operating efficiency. It constitutes an excellent \nmeasure of the ability of operations managers to utilise their assets effectively to generate value \nand earnings.\nEVA over Assets (EVAOA)\nEconomic Value Added or EVA is a measure of performance based on residual income. It is \ncomputed as the difference between net operating profits after taxes and the cost of capital. \nEVA is hence an accurate estimate of a company true economic profit. EVA shows the dollar \namount of wealth a business has created or destroyed in each reporting period. \n2.3.3. Data Set\nThe dataset includes 50 MNEs, divided into real options and non real options users. The \nformer sub-sample groups 25 firms quoted by Triantis and Borison [22] and Copeland [23] as \nhaving adopted the real options \u201ctechnology\u201d in their investment decisions. It is worth noting \nthat there are more than 25 firms which have developed attention to their real options to date \n[30], and that the selection of 25 is a cross-industry sample (we choose to focus on these 25 for \ncomparison only). The 25 remaining companies, the control group, were added to the sample as \nfollows.  For each firm in the first sample, its most direct competitors or \u201cpeer\u201d of similar size \nwas identified (Worldscope) and included as a counterpart in the second sub-sample (provided \nthat it was not in the list of real option users\/attentive firms).   When several \u201cpeers\u201d were \navailable, one was randomly selected.  The purpose of this \u201cmatched\u201d sampling strategy was to \ntry to group two sub-samples which were relatively uniform in terms of their industrial \nPage 13 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n14\ncomposition.  In cross tabulation, the alternative hypothesis is that there should be no patterns \nbetween different sub-samples.  Thus, the matched sampling strategy used was an effort to \nbuild two samples which would be so similar that any pattern would be the result of the only \nsource of variation (attention to real options).   Thus, although the selected MNEs belong to a \nvariety of industries including pharmaceuticals, technology, aerospace, oil and automotive, the \ncross sample industrial affiliation are identical and can be considered as a reliable control group.\nSince the first implementation of real options in industry are dated from the early nineties \n[31][22] performance measures were collected over the period 1994-2004. Data and ratios on \nthe period have been obtained from the Worldscope finance database. Multinationality data \nwas obtained from the Lexis-Nexis international directory of corporate affiliations.\n2.3.4. Testing\nThe sample is cross-classified according to a pair of attributes: (1) attention to real options, \nand (2) a categorical grouping of performance and multinationality measures.  For each \nperformance measures, frequency tables were built to identify three tiers: high values, average, \nand low value.  Tiers either represent top, average, and low performers (e.g. ROA) or different \nratio levels (e.g., PPEOA). Each financial year gives a data point.  As there are 50 companies and \n10 years of data, a total 500 observations are used for each statistical test.  In practice, this \nnumber is adjusted from test to test when some data is missing about some companies.\n2.4. Results\n2.4.1. PP&EOA Chi-Square Test\nPage 14 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n15\nFigure 2 summarises the results.  \u201cRopt\u201d represents the PPEOA ratio observations for firms \nattentive to, or using, real options, and the \u201cNonRopt\u201d is the column of PPEOA observations for \npeers.\n ((Insert figure 2 here))\nFigure 2 shows that there is a 95% confidence level that an association pattern exits \nbetween the use of real options and the values of the PPEOA ratio.  \nAn analysis of figure 2 shows that there is no pattern of association for firms with low \nPPEOA ratios.  As firms with low values (ratios lower than 0.2 in our data set) are likely to be \nthose with labour rather capital intensive operations systems, it is not surprising that using real \noptions or not has no impact.\nFigure 2 shows the following association patterns:\n\uf0b7\uf020 Firms with high PPEOA tend not to use real options.\n\uf0b7\uf020 Firms with average values of PPEOA tend to use real options.\nThis pattern is perfectly consistent with theoretical predictions.  Firms with high ratios (0.4 \nto 0.8) tend to have invested in inflexible assets that they cannot depreciate as their utilisation \nrate is low.  In contrast, firms which use real options invest in flexible assets, which can be \nadapted to changing demand requirements.  These firms manage at all times to load these \nassets.  The resulting high utilization rate leads to a ratio value which tends toward an optimum \n(between 0.2 and 0.4 in our data set).  \nPage 15 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n16\n2.4.2. R&DOA Chi-Square Test\nThis test also reveals the existence of statistically significant (95% confidence level) patterns \nbetween the use of real options and the intensity of R&D investments, as shown in figure 3.\n((Insert figure 3 here))\nFirms that invest heavily in R&D are those that use real options, whereas firms with lower, \nmore moderate values of the ratio, tend not to use real options.  Firms with extremely low value \nof the ratio are indifferent to the use of options: it is not surprising as firms with relatively weak \nR&D levels are unlikely to exhibit a high performance impact if their management of R&D is \nimproved. The results, however, cannot be used for the identification of an optimal value of the \nratio.  A structured model linking R&DOA with the use of real options and a profitability measure \nwould be needed to this end.  Figure 3 shows that real options change the way in which \ncompanies invest in R&D, but the possibility that they over-invest and negatively affect their \nprofitability cannot be excluded.  \n2.4.3. Multinationality Chi-Square Test\nFigure 4 shows that in the case of the multinationality indicator, there is an association \nbetween the use of real options and the number of countries in which a company operates.  An \nanalysis of figure 4 shows a significant pattern whereby top international firms tend to use real \noptions.  This provides them with a larger scope for both strategic and operating flexibility.  \n (( Insert figure 4 here))\n2.4.4. ROA Chi-Square Test\nPage 16 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n17\nFigure 5 shows that in the case of the ROA ratio, the null hypothesis is rejected, i.e. there is \nno association between the use of real options and return on assets.  An analysis of figure 5 \nshows a small pattern whereby top performers tend to use real options, but this observation is \nnot statistically significant.\n((Insert figure 5 here))\n2.4.5. EVAOA Chi-Square Test\nFigure 6 shows that there is a statistically significant association between the EVAOA ratio \nand attention to real options.\nThe pattern is similar to the patterns observed in previous cases.  Low values of EVAOA \nindicate firms for which the use of real options does not make a difference.\nA pattern exists in the case of higher value of the EVAOA ratio.  Figure 6 shows that top \nperformers are much more likely to use real options whereas not so efficient firms (second tiers) \nare much more likely not to use real options.\nThe difference between the results obtained with ROA and EVAOA can only be explained by \nthe difference in the numerator of the ratio:\n\uf0b7\uf020 In the case of ROA, an accrual net income figure is used.\n\uf0b7\uf020 In the case of EVAOA, an economic definition of profits, rather than an accounting \nfigure, is used.\n((Insert figure 6 here))\nPage 17 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n18\nThe EVA is a measure of the economic profit of a firm after it has addressed the earning \nrequirements of stockholders, which means that the EVA is a good measure of a firm ability to \ngenerate excess returns which can be re-invested in the business.  In contrast the ROA ratio\nincludes within its definition of profits funds still to be distributed to shareholders.\nA plausible interpretation of the apparently conflicting results of the ROA and EVA tests is \nthat the use of real options is not associated with higher profitability or operating efficiency, as \nnon real options users can be highly profitable ventures.  Real options users tend to also be \nusers of EVA, and thus, they perform better on this dimension than non users (in other words, \nthe association between EVAOA and real options usage could be spurious).\n2.5. Multinationality and Performance: Empirical conclusions\nThe empirical results can be used to conclude that there is no such thing as a \u201cone size fits \nall\u201d theory of multinational advantage.  Multinational firms that have invested in building real \noptions thinking capabilities within their management decision-making frameworks exhibit a \nbetter management of corporate assets, more investment in research and development, higher \nlevel of internationalisation, and good economic performance.  These firms, however, are not \nnecessarily more profitable than firms that use more traditional models of appraising capital \ninvestments and strategic decisions.\nWe conjecture that traditional multinationals rely mostly on March\u2019s [6] exploitative \nprocesses: as such they derive profits from existing portfolios and processes that they tend to \nreplicate in new markets and locations.  With this approach, profitability and growth are \ngenerated primarily from scale.  The first type of multinationals, however, is made of firms \nPage 18 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n19\nproactively engaged in exploration activities, i.e. firms dedicated to the discovery of new \nopportunities through searches and innovation.  This approach goes hand in hand with the \ntendency of managers to develop an attention towards real options, learn the real options logic, \nand implement it for projects, operations and investment appraisal. As these flexible \nmultinationals permanently develop new capabilities to handle new markets and new \ntechnologies, they need the real options perspective to manage their deployment of flexibility.\n3. The Future of Multinationals: A Population Ecology \nPerspective\n3.1. Futures Methodology\nAlthough our empirical data set demonstrates the current co-existence of two types of \nMNCs, it does not tell us anything about their respective proportion in economies and their \nlikelihood of survival.\nIn order to answer this question, our futures methodology is inspired by Fuller\u2019s paper on \nthe future of small business [32].  Fuller\u2019s approach is based on recognising that the future of \nsmall businesses is before all determined by what society will support, stimulate, or reject.  For \nexample, the fact that small businesses have been \u201cothered\u201d by large businesses raises \nquestions about the potential of small businesses to continue to fulfil some of their ecological \nroles in society.  Fuller concludes that small businesses have a bright future only if society learns \nto value personal commitment and entrepreneurship.  In the opposite case, they may become \nextinct, or continue to be marginalised as a form of antiquated but robust and cheap providers \nPage 19 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n20\nof labour [32].  Given current, or likely future economic environments, how are traditional and \nflexible MNCs likely to fare? Does society favour traditional or flexible multinationals?  In order \nto answer this question, we need to investigate what are the reciprocal impacts of traditional \nand flexible MNCs when they compete against one another. \nTo appreciate the scope of this question, compare the global airline industry with the oil \nindustry.  In the airline industry, the co-existence of explorative and exploitative firms can be \nwitnessed.  Examples of explorative firms are firms differentiated by their quality of service (e.g. \nSingapore Airlines, Virgin Atlantic) or low cost airlines (e.g. Ryanair).  Examples of exploitative \nfirms are the traditional national flag carriers.  The oil industry, in contrast, does not present any \nvividly differentiated example of an explorative firm: in this sector, one business strategy, \nexploitation, seems to dominate.  We argue that market-based factors cannot be used to\nexplain this difference.  Consumers should be as interested in cheap oil, or alternative products, \nthan they are in cheap or high quality airlines.  Instead, the difference between the airline and \nthe oil industries can be explained from an industrial ecology perspective, i.e. from the \nresources that firms have access to (or that society is willing to provide to them), and their \nrelative ability to utilise these resource efficiently.  The theoretical framework of organisational \necology developed by Hannan and Freeman [33][34] was designed to conduct this type of \ninvestigation.  \n3.2. Population Ecology Framework\nFor the sake of simplification, we summarise the variance observed within the contingency \ntables of section 2 by making the assumption that a population of multinationals (P = P1+P2) in a \nspecific industry is composed of two sub-populations: (1) a class (P1) of multinationals using \nPage 20 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n21\ntraditional investment and strategic decision models and (2) a class (P2) of multinationals \nadopting flexibility management (e.g. using real options) in order to plan for and exercise \nstrategic flexibility.  We assume that members of the first population rely predominantly on \nexploitation mechanisms, whereas members of the second population have the competencies \nto balance exploitation with exploration [6].  The empirical results of the previous section \nsupport the realism of these assumptions.\nLet N1 and N2 be respectively the number of members of P1 and P2.  In order to estimate \nvalues for N1 and N2, we need to consider birth and mortality rate functions for these two sub-\npopulations.  Hannan and Freeman [34] use Lotka and Voltera\u2019s assumption that birth rate falls \nlinearly with the size of the population, as shown in equation 1.\n                                          Equation 1\n represents the birth rate of new firms within a population (Pi).   is a constant \nparameter for population (Pi) representing the unconstrained birth rate whereas  is a positive \nconstant parameter measuring the decrease in birth rate as the population grows.\nThe mortality rate of a population (Pi) is shown in equation 2, where:\n\uf0b7\uf020 is a constant parameter for population (Pi) representing the unconstrained \nmortality rate.\nPage 21 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n22\n\uf0b7\uf020  is a positive constant parameter measuring the increase in mortality rate as the \npopulation grows and competition intensifies.\n                                          Equation 2\nThe growth rate of a population i, , is the difference between the birth rate and the \nmortality rate.  The Lotka-Voltera population growth model, shown in equation 3, expresses that \nthe increase of the population dNi over a short time interval dt can be computed as the product \nof the growth rate  and the current population level Ni.  \n                                                 Equation 3a\nA more useful way of writing equation 3 is shown in equation 3b (see [34] for details).\n                                   Equation 3b\nWhere  is the intrinsic growth rate, i.e. the growth rate in the absence of any population \nsize effects.   is the carrying capacity of population Pi, i.e. the maximum number of members\nPage 22 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n23\nthat a population can contain given the population dynamics parameters used in equations 1 \nand 2.  Analytical expressions for  and  are shown respectively in equation 4 and 5 (Cf. [34]).\n                                               Equation 4\n                                                Equation 5\nEquation 3b can be used to model the evolution of  over time in the case of an isolated \npopulation of firms.  The Lotka-Voltera model of competitive interaction between two \npopulations is an extension of the basic population growth model by introducing two \ncompetition coefficients .   measures the impact that population j has on growth of \npopulation i.  This impact is illustrated in equation 6, which can be extended to the case of more \nthan 2 populations competing with each other (cf. Section 4).\n                  Equation 6\nThere are two ways through which the size of competing sub-populations can be studied.  \nThe first and most commonly used method is to derive equilibrium conditions from equation 6: \nfor n sub-population problems, this consists of solving a system of n equations.  In this paper, we \nprefer a second way of deriving equilibriums conditions by means of a simple time-based \nsimulation.  The results (Ni at equilibrium) are the same.  The advantage of the second approach \nis the fact that we can graph the convergence of the populations toward the equilibrium point \nand study directly the sensitivity of results to changes in the model parameters.\nPage 23 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n24\n3.3. Parameter Estimation\nIn order to run a simulation, realistic assumptions about the population dynamics \nparameters must be made, as shown in table 1.  \n((Insert table 1))\nAlthough empirical works have estimated these parameters for specific industries [35][36], \nthere are no clear published benchmarks regarding what these parameters could be for MNCs.  \nIt is important to note from a methodology standpoint that the absolute values of these \nparameters are less important than estimating the relative difference between the values for \npopulations 1 and 2. As the objective of this paper is to contrast the normative view of flexible \nMNCs with a population ecology view, we only need a realistic assessment of the difference \nbetween parameters rather than actual values.\n represents the unconstrained birth rate of population (Pi).  Most empirical studies of \npopulation ecology use industries where enterprise creation is easy and frequent, as for \nexample the restaurant business [37] or the retailing industry [38].  It is more unusual to think of \nthe \u201cbirth\u201d of a multinational.  \nThe parameter estimates for  are based on the idea that new multinationals can be the \nresult of three separate demographic processes: (i) the internationalisation of a domestic firm, \n(ii) the creation of a born-global firm [39], and (iii) the abandonment of exploration activities by \na member of P2 joining P1.  As members of P1 focus on exploitation, they are likely to rely on \nrigid structures and to exhibit strong structural inertia [40], and thus, they are unlikely to be able \nPage 24 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n25\nto re-engineer themselves toward acquiring exploration capabilities, so we exclude the \npossibility of a P2 to P1 transformation.  \nBecoming a new member of P1, where imitation and replication of existing business models \nsuffice to fuel growth, should be considerably easier than becoming a member of population P2.  \nConsider the contrast between a domestic firm investing in a neighbouring country and a new \nfirm trying to launch at a global scale an innovative idea.  For these reasons, we assume that \nis much higher than .\n represents the impact of population size, Ni, on birth rate. As members of P1 rely on\nreplication and imitation, there is no need for a unique competitive advantage to enter the\nindustry: as this is independent of how many firms are already in place,  is assumed to be \nvery low.  The relative ease with which the Virgin group has entered the train and media \nindustries is an illustration of low coefficients.\nMembers of P2, however, require specific management and technological competencies to \nenter the industry.  Explorative firms combine the difficulty of becoming a multinational with \nthat of innovating and creating new processes.  This is an acceptable strategy in the absence of \ncompetition in order to seek first-mover advantages.  This is a risky strategy if several firms \nwithin P2 are trying to compete with one another.  The controversy behind the adequate use of \nreal options in management decision making [14] in the context of new markets and new \ntechnical agendas confirms the difficulty of entering a crowded innovative industry segment.  \nMoreover, Cottrell and Sick [41] show how innovative advantages often accrue to second \nPage 25 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n26\nmovers or followers rather than to first movers.  Thus, it is more difficult to enter a mature \nrather than a young population 2. For this reason, we assume that is much higher than \nFirms in population 1 do not adopt risky strategies, and thus, their risk of mortality \nshould be less, relatively speaking, than that of population 2, . Table 1 shows that the \nassumed intrinsic growth rate of population 1 is  whereas that of population 2 is \n.  This takes into account not only the probability of failure of risky exploration \nstrategies, but the fact that many once-innovative firms will join the ranks of population 1 after \nmaturity.  \nAlthough firms in population 1 can be created and can grow easily, competition between \nthem is likely to be intense as they are unlikely to be differentiated.  Firms in population 2, \nhowever, thanks to the differentiation resulting from exploration, are likely to compete less \nintensively with each other once established.  Therefore, we assume that  is much higher \nthan .\nThe estimation of the competition coefficients  is more difficult, and this difficulty finds \nits roots in the myopic view that multinational compete only with domestic firms.  As most \nresearch papers try to demonstrate that multinationals are \u201cbetter\u201d organisational forms, \nresearchers have overlooked the fact that multinationals compete with one another and the \nimpact that this competition has on performance.  The problem is that because competition \nbetween multinationals is under-researched, coming up with realistic value for  is not trivial.  \nIt is useful to consider Schoener\u2019s method [42] for estimating competition coefficients.  This \nPage 26 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n27\ncomputation method is based on the resource utilisation of the two different populations, as \nshown in equation 7.\n                                         Equation 7\nThe expression  in equation 7 measures the difficulty for a member of population i to \nfind a needed resource input  given the availability of this resource.  The numerator \nterms estimate the probability of competition between a member of population i and a member \nof population j for a given resource k.  It is compared at the denominator level with the \nprobability of two members of the same population i to compete with each other for this unit of \nresource.  These probabilities are weighted with the benefits derived by each population for \neach unit of resource consumed. \nOur estimation of competition coefficients is done by considering that MNCs compete with \none another on five key resources: public fund, private funds, standard labour, talented labour, \nand entrepreneurs.\nWe consider that:\n\uf0b7\uf020 both types of MNCs permanently compete for public funds, \n\uf0b7\uf020 explorative MNCs may use private funds but are not in competition with traditional \nMNCs for that resource, \nPage 27 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n28\n\uf0b7\uf020 both moderately compete to attract standard labour,\n\uf0b7\uf020  they also compete on attracting talented labour.  \n\uf0b7\uf020 that explorative multinationals are much more apt at attracting talented labour when \ncompared to traditional MNCs, and \n\uf0b7\uf020 it will always attract potential \u201cintrapreneurs\u201d whereas traditional MNCs will have very \nlittle career appeal to entrepreneurs.  \nOn this basis, we estimate: \nand \nNote that a competition coefficient is always between 0 (no resource competition) and 1 (as \nmuch competition as between two members of the same species).\n4. Findings: Exploration and Exploitation by MNCs\nWe consider a hypothetical economy, composed exclusively of traditional and flexible \nmultinationals, with an initial number N1=25 and N2=25 of MNCs respectively.\nGiven the parameters estimated in table 1, the carrying capacity of the population of \ntraditional firms is K1=48 firms and that of flexible multinational is K2=28.  Thus, even in the \nabsence of inter-species competition, and contrary the theory of multinational advantage, \ntraditional multinationals are likely to thrive when compared with flexible multinationals.  Figure \n7 displays how the hypothetical economy converges toward equilibrium conditions when \nPage 28 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n29\ncompetition between the two species takes place. The competitive impact of flexible \nmultinationals on traditional ones is higher (0.7) than the reciprocal impact: this is due to the \nhigher economic profitability of flexible MNCs (cf. Section 2, taken into account through the \ncoefficients bik in equation 7).  Despite this competitive advantage and the ability to attract \nsome specific resources (e.g. entrepreneurs), figure 7 shows that this does not result in a \ndemographic advantage.  As competition takes place, traditional multinationals increase their \nmembership from 25 to 38 firms whereas flexible MNCs drop theirs to 13 firms.\n((Insert figure 7 here))\nThus, current societal and economic rules, over time, imply that MNCs relying on \nexploitation tend to dominate (demographically speaking) MNCs engaging in exploration.  This \nconclusion is highly sensitive to the value of the competition coefficients.  A sensitivity analysis \non \uf06112 and \uf06121, however, shows that the existence of traditional MNCs is not at stake: even in \nthe extreme (and unrealistic) case where \uf06112= 1 and \uf06121=0, traditional MNCs survive with 19 \nfirms (against 28 explorative firms).  If the ability of traditional MNCs to forage the resources of \nflexible multinationals is increased to \uf06121=0.6, then flexible MNCs are likely to become extinct \naltogether.\nKogut\u2019s [2] and Buckley and Casson\u2019s [1] flexible MNC will always struggle to survive, and \ncan only do so by maintaining excellence and a highly competitive behaviour.  This possibly \nexplains why only a minority (10 to 27%) of Fortune 1000 firms use innovative flexibility \nmanagement techniques (e.g. real options) in their decision making.  The few flexible MNCs that \nmanage to survive through the integration of real options thinking in their corporate decision \nPage 29 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n30\nmaking procedures manage to maintain a competitive position.  This position, however, is \nfraught with risks.  Should some of our assumptions about resource availability and resource \nacquisition change, the struggle of flexible MNCs could end.  For example, in an economy where \ninvestors prefer to invest in innovative ventures, and resent investing in exploitative firms, or if \ntalented labour refused to work in exploitative firms, the flexible MNE could strive.\nIt is important to moderate these conclusions with the acknowledgement that the \npopulation dynamics parameters used in this section remain crude estimates.  A research \nprogramme about the population ecology of multinationals could help to provide more accurate \nestimates of the parameters used in the simulation. For instance, empirical values of the \nestimates would be needed to confirm at what level both types of MNCs really coexist.\n5. Findings: Generalised Competition Model\nMNCs do not compete just with one another in terms of securing resources.  For example, \nthe majority of workers in an economy tend to work for small businesses. MNCs find themselves \nin direct competition with small businesses when it comes to resource consumption.  Whereas \nstandard labour is likely to be indifferent to work for MNCs or small businesses, talented labour \nmay have a strong preference to join the ranks of MNCs, where better career opportunities can \nbe found: this is an example of the impact that society, through its shared and socially \nconstructed values, can have on the survival of different types of business firms.  Entrepreneurs \nare likely to be strongly attracted to small businesses where they can pursue projects of radical \ninnovation which would be difficult to finance and justify at a larger scale. \nPage 30 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n31\nThe model of population ecology presented in section 4 is expanded in this section by \nrecognising that other organisational forms will compete for resources with MNCs.  Consistently\nwith Fuller [32], we recognise that small business form a heterogeneous population.  In the \ncontext of this paper, we are especially concerned with the existence of explorative and \nexploitative small businesses.  \nExplorative small businesses, or \u201cinnovative SMEs\u201d are trying to breakthrough new markets \nthrough innovation.  As they grow, they are often purchased by and merged within large MNCs.  \nThus, the mortality rate of explorative SMEs is high: not only is their creation and strategic \ndirections based on aggressive risk positions, but success often ends up in acquisition, and thus, \nexiting the population.  \nExploitative small businesses, or \u201csupply SMEs\u201d, use standard business models and \nspecialise in the supply of undifferentiated goods and service to either consumers or MNCs. \nIn addition to these two additional species, we also consider communities of practices (COP) \nas another organisational form that compete for funds, talent, and entrepreneurial skills with \nthe other species.  Our analysis only considers \u201cindependent\u201d communities of practice (such as \nthe COP which resulted in the development of Linux) rather than intra-organisational COPs, \nwhich are typically part of MNCs [43].  As discussed in other papers in this special issue [44], it is \nexpected that COPs could play a role in the future of international business.  From a population \necology perspective, the fact that COPs are often based on volunteer time, may be self-financed, \nand be the result of individual\u2019s passion for a project give them a relatively high propensity for \nbirth and a strong ability to attract resources, which they will need to a lesser degree than \nPage 31 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n32\ntraditional organisations (e.g. funds). COP can fail though [43], and thus they are not immune to \nmortality.  Table 2 lists the parameter estimates regarding population dynamics for each of the \nfive species.  \nOne difficulty in estimating these parameters is the drastic difference between the large \nMNCs, in terms of turnover, assets, and employees and small businesses.  As Fuller [32] points \nout, small businesses, although numerous, are powerless in the modern economic environment, \nsuggesting weak individual competitive impact on MNCs.  In order to make table and graphs \nmore easy to interpret, table 2 is based on a notional average MNC of 5000 employees \ncompeting with a cluster, or network, of 100 small businesses employing on average 50 \nemployees.  For example, the carrying capacity of supply SMEs of 99 in table 2 should be read as \na carrying capacity of 9,900 businesses.\nTable 3 shows estimates of the community matrix of competition coefficients between each \nof the species.  Each coefficient was estimated with the same qualitative procedure inspired \nfrom equation 7, as described in section 3.  \nKey assumptions are:\n\uf0b7\uf020 Public funds: The competition is intense between MNCs.  Innovative SMEs and COPs \nalso seek this resource, but they only have a very weak impact on MNCs ability to secure \npublic funds.\n\uf0b7\uf020 Private funds: This is the main battlefield of supply and innovative SMEs, with innovative \nSMEs having a head advantage: whereas we assume that investors in publicly traded \nPage 32 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n33\nfunds prefer safe, exploitative businesses, we assume that in the private funds market, \ninvestors prefer innovative businesses.\n((Insert table 2 here))\n\uf0b7\uf020 Standard Labour: Competition is high between all species, at the exception of COPs, \nwhich need very little, or none, of this resource.\n\uf0b7\uf020 Talented labour: All species compete actively for this resource, which includes talented \nmanagement, operators, technicians, etc.  In the small business sector, we assume that \ninnovative firms will attract more of this resource, and similarly, we assume that flexible \nMNCs will have more appeal than traditional MNCs.  Small businesses have a small \ncompetitive impact on large MNCs, and MNCs have an important competitive impact on \nsmall businesses.  COPs are a new form of competition, which attract talented labour \naway from all other species.  The impact, however, is stronger on small businesses than \nMNCs, who can run their own intra-organisational COPs.\n\uf0b7\uf020 Entrepreneurs:  Small businesses compete with one another, with innovative SMEs \nhaving a clear advantage over supply SMEs.  Innovative SMEs also have a strong \ncompetitive impact on flexible MNCs, as entrepreneurs prefer to work in an \nunconstrained, small-scale environment rather than for corporate giants.  COPs are a \nstrong competitor of innovative SMEs.\n(( Insert table 3 here))\nPage 33 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n34\nFigure 8 displays three graphs.  Graph (1) shows all the species together, but with only MNCs \ncompeting with one another (hence other species reach their carrying capacity, Ki).   Graph (2) \ntakes into account the competition between P3 (supply SMEs) and P4 (Innovative SMEs) in \naddition that between the MNCs.  Finally, graph (3) is based on the full community matrix \nshown in table 3, and illustrates the case where all species compete with one another.\n((Insert figure 8 here))\nFigure 8 shows a clear pattern.  As creating, managing, and sustaining an innovative business \nwhich balances exploration and exploitation (populations P2 and P4) is inherently more difficult \nand risky than relying on economic exploitation (populations P1 and P3), explorative firms, \nwhether large or small, struggle for survival.  Whereas some individual factors support them \n(the willingness of individuals to risk personal savings, the desire of entrepreneurs to be \nindependent, etc.) other societal factors (e.g. the preference to invest in safe firms, the \npreference for workers to pursue a career in a low risk industry), the balance in terms of \ncompetition dynamics is against them.  Graph 3 above shows that they can barely survive \nwhereas exploitative populations strive.  In terms of innovation and exploration, communities of \npractice are the organisational form that can strive in the face of competition from exploitative \nfirms: their existence, however, in the possibly exaggerated graph 3, would bring both flexible \nMNCs and innovative SMEs to near extinction.\n6. Conclusion: Implications for the Future of International \nBusiness\nPage 34 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n35\nThe future of international business is likely to be the result of an intensification of \ncompetition on the basis of exploitative processes.  At the time of writing this paper, there are \nstill ample opportunities for international growth, irrespectively of the nature of the strategy \n(exploration versus exploitation) followed by MNCs.  There are also considerable growth \nopportunities for MNCs from emerging economies to invest in markets overlooked by MNCs \nfrom older economies.  \nIt is because firms\u2019 adaptive processes prefer exploitation over exploration [6], that the \nsimulation of population dynamics suggests that it is unlikely that a new era of competition on \nthe basis of exploration only could emerge.  This also explains the low proportion of P2\ncompanies nowadays, and the disappointing results of the multinationality-performance \nresearch programme. The population dynamics parameters used in this paper show that, \ndespite the apparent superiority of explorative companies, both type of multinationals should \ncoexist in the long-run, with traditional multinationals being able to emerge and grow more \neasily than explorative firms.  The findings also implies that because of population dynamics and \nthe permanent competition from traditional multinationals (not so good at innovation, but \nlucrative and numerous), the multinational organisational form may not the best organisational \ntemplate for innovation, leaving space for small organisations, or other organisational forms, to \noperate profitably.  \nAlternatively, one could argue that if it ever comes to the saturation of population P1, this \nmay lead MNCs to switch to the strategies of population P2 to seek more differentiated market \npositions and novel approaches to growth.  This turnaround would match Kogut and Kulatilaka\u2019s \n[19] recommendation of using real options for corporate renewal and against structural inertia.  \nPage 35 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n36\nWhether firms that have fine tuned their exploitative processes can operate such a \ntransformation is a question for debate.  Thus, the once golden child of international business\nresearch, the flexible MNC, seems to have a future fraught with the danger of extinction.\nGiven the scale of assets and manpower of multinationals, and their increasing economic \nand political importance, the question of the relative evolution of the two sub-population P1 and \nP2 is key to understanding the future of international business, and the potential contribution of \ninternal business to economic, technological, and social development.  \nTo illustrate this point it is useful to consider two practical examples of industries at \ndifferent stages of population maturity. Unlike other industrial sectors, the airline industry is \nprobably close to the saturation of its traditional population P1 as evidenced by the bankruptcy \nof many national carriers (e.g. Swissair, Sabena, and Alitalia).  The industry has always had an \nexploitative character with its self-imposed regulation forbidding differentiation on the basis of \nquality of services.  Its more explorative sub-population P2 (e.g. Singapore Airline, Cathay Pacific, \nVirgin Atlantic) is smaller (consistently with the dynamics shown in figure 7) but remains a \nrobust, differentiated, and profitable segment despite the troubled times experienced by other \nairlines.\nThe global oil industry is at a different evolutionary stage.  Due to the fundamental role of \noil in national economies, the oil industry is characterised by a dominance of exploitation \nmechanisms, as evidenced by the cartel-type arrangements currently in place.  In an \nexploitation-based economy, significant profits can be accumulated by voluntarily restricting \nsupply when demand is increasing.  Profits are derived from inflated prices rather than growth, \nPage 36 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n37\nand both the restriction of input and the economic gloom which comes with this restriction \nmake it more difficult for an innovative and competition-oriented population P2 to grow and \nturn markets around. \nAlthough our simulation results suggest that explorative MNCs can never dominate an \neconomy in the long run, reflecting upon such a future is not uninteresting.  To go back to the oil \nindustry example, it would mean the rise of a sub-population of MNCs not thinking of \nthemselves as exploiting a natural resource but seeking differentiated and sustainable ways to \nbetter serve the needs of energy consumers.  Such transformations have taken place in other \nindustries, as for example by film manufacturers that have reconverted themselves to the digital \ncamera industry.  In other words, if flexible MNCs could come to dominate their industries, it is \nunder such a scenario that the greatest economic transformations could take place, as \nexploration is opposed to the structural inertia that comes with exploitation.  However, our \npopulation ecology approach shows that if current societal values and processes are an \nindication of what the future will be, such a scenario is very unlikely to ever unfold.  Not unlike \nFuller\u2019s conclusion about the bright future of small businesses in a society which values \nindividual human spirit [32], the flexible MNC only has a bright future in a society which values, \nsupport, and select progress and innovation over easy, safe, and short-term gains.\nFinally, this paper\u2019s findings also highlight that seeking social progress and innovation \nthrough businesses that have to compete for survival with non innovative businesses may \nsimply be a poor idea.  The origin of this poor idea could be a general confusion between the \nidea of competing for market share (which requires innovation) and competing for resources \n(which does not require innovation).  Therefore, the future of international business may be one \nPage 37 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n38\nof providing undifferentiated, or moderately differentiated products and services, to the \nmasses.  Innovation, social progress, improvement to quality of life, flexible responses to \nchanging economic and societal conditions are reasons why small business networks, or new \norganisational forms such as communities of practice, have a bright future.\nPage 38 of 46\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n39\nReferences\n [1] P.
