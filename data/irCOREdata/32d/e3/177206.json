They were\ndigitised and five regions of interest (ROI) were identified from the femoral head and neck for\nanalysis. The power spectrum was obtained from the Fourier transform of each region and three\nprofiles were produced; a circular profile and profiles parallel and perpendicular to the preferred\norientation of the trabeculae. PCA was used to generate a score from each profile, which we\nhypothesised could be used to discriminate between the fracture and control groups. The fractal\ndimension was also calculated for comparison. The area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve (Az) discriminating the hip fracture cases from controls was calculated for each analysis.\nResults: Texture analysis of standard radiographs using the fast Fourier transform yielded variables\nthat were significantly associated with fracture and not significantly correlated with age, body mass\nindex or femoral neck bone mineral density. The anisotropy of the trabecular structure was\nimportant; both the perpendicular and circular profiles were significantly better than the parallel-\nprofile (P < 0.05). No significant differences resulted from using the various ROI within the proximal\nfemur. For the best three groupings of profile (circular, parallel or perpendicular), method (PCA\nor fractal) and ROI (Az = 0.84 \u2013 0.93), there were no significant correlations with femoral neck bone\nmineral density, age, or body mass index. PCA analysis was found to perform better than fractal\nanalysis (P = 0.019).\nConclusions: Both PCA and fractal analysis of the FFT data could discriminate successfully\nbetween the fracture and control groups, although PCA was significantly stronger than fractal\ndimension. This method appears to provide a powerful tool for the assessment of bone structure\nin vivo with advantages over standard fractal methods.\nPublished: 06 October 2004\nBMC Medical Imaging 2004, 4:4 doi:10.1186\/1471-2342-4-4\nReceived: 30 April 2004\nAccepted: 06 October 2004\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/4\/4\n\u00a9 2004 Gregory et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2004, 4:4 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/4\/4Background\nThe NIH Consensus Statement defines Osteoporosis as \"a\nskeletal disorder characterised by compromised bone\nstrength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture\" [1].\nBone strength was defined as \"the integration of two main\nfeatures: bone density and bone quality\".

Previous studies, however, have found\nthat trabecular bone structure also plays a significant role\nin determining bone strength [3-5] with BMD explaining\nonly 60 to 80 % of the variability in mechanical resistance\n[6].\nTrabecular bone structure is visible on standard pelvic\nradiographs and many attempts have been made to quan-\ntify the quality of the structure and assess its relationship\nto osteoporosis and BMD. These range from visual scoring\nsystems, such as the Singh index [7], through to sophisti-\ncated computerised methods based on fractals [8-10] and\nother image processing methods [11-13]. A review of the\nliterature suggests that fractal analysis has been a method\nof choice in recent years for the analysis of trabecular bone\nstructure in CT scans [14,15], MRI [16], histology [17] and\nradiographs [18-21], although it has not been established\ncategorically that it is preferable to other methods of tex-\nture analysis [22,23]. By reducing all the information in\nthe image to one descriptor, the fractal dimension [24], a\nlarge part of the information is lost. The Fourier transform\nof an image expresses the information in the image in\nterms of spatial frequencies rather than distances. Various\nmethods can be applied to extract information from the\nFourier transform [25], including the fractal dimension\n[24]. However such methods have not been fully\nexploited for analysing bone structure [8,26-30].\nIn this study we investigate the use of Fourier transforms\nand Principal Components Analysis to generate a mathe-\nmatical model of the data which can be used to help clas-\nsify individuals according to the presence or absence of a\nhip fracture. Principal component analysis (PCA) [31] is a\ndata reduction technique that has been applied in many\nfields of study, including investigation of gene expression\n[32], development of an electronic nose [33] and tracing\nof the evolutionary changes in fish morphometry [34]. It\ndescribes data in terms of a small number of orthogonal,\nlinearly independent components which contain the\nmajority of the information. PCA has no preconditions,\nsuch as relying on the data to fit a normal or fractal distri-\nbution, but builds a mathematical model based on the\ncorrelations present in the data. An eigenanalysis of the\ncorrelation or covariance matrix is used to perform PCA.\nThe resulting components are then selected in order of the\namount of variance they account for, enabling an efficient\nmapping of the data. As the first few components account\nfor the vast majority of the variance in the original data,\nthey can be selected for analysis whilst the remainder are\ndiscarded as 'noise'. In this way, the number of variables\ncan be greatly reduced whilst maintaining the informa-\ntion present in the original data. In this pilot study we\nused these methods to investigate the similarities and dif-\nferences between trabecular bone structure in fracture and\ncontrol groups using standard radiographs of the proxi-\nmal femur.\nMethods\nStudy data\nA set of digitised standard pelvic radiographs was availa-\nble from a previous investigation into the morphology of\nthe proximal femur [35]. These radiographs were taken\nfrom an earlier study [36], that had examined three\ngroups (osteoporotic, osteoarthritic and control) of age\nmatched, postmenopausal women (30 subjects per\ngroup). Subjects with osteoarthritis were excluded from\nthe present study. All patients had undergone a scan of the\nunfractured hip by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry\n(DXA) using a Norland XR-26 scanner (CooperSurgical\nInc, Trumbull, CT). The controls had had their left hip\nscanned. All patients and controls had had a pelvic antero-\nposterior radiograph recorded within a year of the DXA\nscan. We used those radiographs and the femoral neck\nBMD (Neck-BMD) data in the current study. A data set of\n50 digitised radiographs was available comprising 26 hip\nfracture patients (HIP) and 24 controls (CNT). The radio-\ngraphs were digitised, using a Howtek MultiRAD 850\nscanner (Howtek, Hudson, New Hampshire) at a resolu-\ntion of 584 dpi (44 \u00b5m per pixel) and a depth of 12 bits.\nThe age, height and weight of each subject were also\nrecorded.\nRegion selection\nFive regions of interest (ROIs) were selected relative to the\nprincipal trabecular systems in locations known to be\nrelated to hip fracture via the Singh index [7] and BMD\nanalysis [37]. To ensure reproducibility, their locations\nwere determined in relation to the centre and angle of the\nnarrowest part of the femoral neck and the centre and\nradius of the femoral head on each image, as shown in\nFigure 1.\nEach ROI was 256 \u00d7 256 pixels (11.3 mm square), to ena-\nble use of the fast Fourier transform, and were selected as\nfollows. The upper region of the head (UH) lies on the\nupper part of the principal compressive trabeculae, the\ncentral region of the head (CH) is at the intersection of the\nprincipal compressive and tensile trabeculae, the upper\nregion of the neck (UN) lies on the principal tensile\ntrabeculae, the lower region of the neck (LN) is at the base\nof the principal compressive trabeculae and finally Ward's\ntriangle (WA) which lies between these structures.

Displays the five regions of interest, upper femoral head (UH), central femoral head (CH), upper femo-\nral neck (UN), Ward's triangle area (WA) and the lower femoral neck (LN) used for analysis. Points A to G are determined by \nthe femoral head and neck and used to locate the ROIs. Points A and E mark the femoral neck width. Points B, C and D lie at \n1\/4, 1\/2 and 3\/4 along this line. Point F is the centre point of the femoral head, point G at 1\/2 the radius of the femoral head at \nan angle of 45 degrees to the neck width, 135 degrees to the neck shaft, shown as a dashed line through point C.Page 3 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2004, 4:4 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/4\/4points and regions were identified using a macro written\nfor Image Pro Plus software (version 4.1.0.0, Media\nCybernetics, Silver Spring, Maryland). The femoral head\nwas described by a best-fit circle, calculated from a series\nof manually marked points around the outline of the fem-\noral head. Between 15 and 20 evenly spaced points were\nused to describe the outline, depending on the size of the\nhead. The radius and centre (marked as F in Figure 1) of\nthe femoral head were then taken from this circle. The nar-\nrowest part of the neck (neck-width) was determined\nusing two automatic edge traces, marking the upper and\nlower outlines of the femoral neck. The first point and the\ndirection for each trace were marked manually; the edge\nof the neck could then be identified automatically by the\nsoftware. The neck width (A \u2013 E in Figure 1) was calculated\nby finding the smallest Euclidean distance between the\ntraces. The centre of the neck was located at the mid-point\nof this line (point C) and the axis of the femoral neck was\ntaken to be a line perpendicular to this through the centre\nof the neck (dashed line). The top right corner of the WA\nregion was located at the midpoint of the neck width\n(point C). Points B and D were placed 25% and 75% of\nthe way along the neck width and used as the midpoints\nof the UN and LN regions respectively. Point F, the centre\nof the femoral head marked the centre of the CH region\nand point G, the centre of the base of the UH region. Point\nG was placed one half of the femoral head radius above\npoint F, at a 45-degree angle to the neck width (A-E).\nRegion analysis\nAnalysis was performed using Matlab software (version\n6.1.0, MathWorks Inc, Natick, Massachusetts). A fast Fou-\nrier transform was generated for each ROI and three pro-\nfiles were generated using data from the power spectrum.\nFirstly a global or circular profile (CircP) was generated,\ncomposed of the magnitude at each spatial frequency\naveraged across all angles, resulting in a profile with 128\ndata points. To create this profile, each pixel in the Fourier\ntransform was assigned to the integer spatial frequency\nthat most closely matched its' distance from the zero'th\ncomponent.\nThe angle of preferred orientation was calculated by find-\ning the angle of the maximum value in the power spec-\ntrum for the first 25 spatial frequencies [38]. The\nmaximum value over this range relates to the dominant\ntexture orientation within the image, the trabecular struc-\nture. As data in the frequency domain relate to features in\nthe spatial domain rotated by 90\u00b0, the median of the val-\nues plus 90\u00b0 was taken as the angle of preferred orienta-\ntion for each image. Due to the symmetry of the Fourier\npower spectrum, angles were only calculated between 0\u00b0\nand 180\u00b0, rather than 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. Two more profiles\nwere then generated, parallel with (ParP) and perpendic-\nular to (PerP) the angle of preferred orientation. In this\ncase the average value was calculated at each spatial fre-\nquency from all points lying within \u00b1 5\u00b0 of the desired\nangle (Fig. 2).\nPrincipal component analysis\nPrincipal component analysis [31] was used to model sta-\ntistically the shape of each set of profiles (parallel, perpen-\ndicular and circular). This was performed using an\neigenanalysis of the correlation matrix. The eigenvectors\nthen become the principal components and are selected\nin order, depending on their eigenvalue. The eigenvalues\nare associated with the components in decreasing order,\nthe largest eigenvalue is associated with the first compo-\nnent and the smallest with the last. In order to choose the\nnumber of components for analysis, a scree plot [31,39]\nwas generated by plotting the eigenvalues (representing\nthe proportion of variance described by each component)\nagainst the component number (Figure 3). In each case,\nthe first few principal components were selected for anal-\nysis using the scree test [39] to find an 'elbow' in the slope\nof the plot. This is used as a threshold between the com-\nponents that contained useful information, which were\nthen used as input variables for further analysis, and those\nthat could be attributed to noise.\nFractal analysis\nFractal analysis was performed on each profile using a\nmethod similar to the Fourier transform technique\ndescribed by Majumdar et al [40]. The average power spec-\ntrum of the circular profile was plotted on a log-log scale,\nthree approximately linear regions were defined and the\ngradient (slope) of a straight line fitted to each region was\nfound; slopeA, a 'coarse' slope, where the log of the spatial\nfrequency is less than or equal to 1.0, slopeB a 'medium'\nslope, where the log of the spatial frequency lies between\n1.0 and 1.75 and slopeC, a 'fine' slope where the log of the\nspatial frequency is above 1.75. The fractal dimension was\ncalculated for each slope using the formula suggested by\nMajumdar et al [40]\nStatistical analysis\nStepwise discriminant analysis was used to select principal\ncomponents that could be combined to build a linear\nclassifier. If the stepwise procedure failed to select any\ncomponents, the most accurate of the individual compo-\nnents was chosen. The same procedure was used to dis-\ncriminate between the groups using the fractal dimension.\nMeasurement of the area under the ROC curve was used\nto compare the classifiers built using the discriminant\nanalysis [41]. A three way ANOVA was applied in order to\ndetermine whether there were significant differences\nbetween the performance of classifiers depending on the\nD\nslope\nFFT =\n\u2212( )7\n2Page 4 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2004, 4:4 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/4\/4Profile generationFigure 2\nProfile generation.

A one-way ANOVA was used\nto test for significant differences in the performance of the\nslopes from each spatial frequency band used in the fractal\nanalysis. T-tests, correlation and ANOVA were performed\nusing SigmaStat (version 2.03, SPSS Science, Chicago).\nPrincipal component analysis, discriminant analysis, and\nmeasurement of the area under the ROC curve were calcu-\nlated using SPSS (version 10 SPSS Science, Chicago).\nResults\nThere were no significant differences between the age,\nheight, weight or body mass index (BMI) of the fracture\nand control groups (Table 1). As expected femoral neck-\nBMD was significantly lower in the fracture group in com-\nparison to the control group (P = 0.001).\nThe Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a\nplot of True Positive Fraction v False Positive Fraction (or\nSensitivity v 1 \u2013 Specificity). The area underneath the\ncurve (Az) represents the performance of the classifier\nranging from a value of 0.5 if it is no better than chance to\n1.0 for a perfect discriminator. Table 2 shows Az for PCA\nanalysis by region for the circular, perpendicular and par-\nallel profiles respectively, discriminating fracture and con-\ntrol cases. A wide range of values was observed (overall\nmean 0.70, standard deviation 0.11).

Femoral\nneck BMD lay between the third and fourth best texture\nmeasures (Az = 0.79 95% CI = 0.66 \u2013 0.91). Plots of the\nROC curves for the strongest combinations of image anal-\nysis classifier are shown in Figure 4.\nTable 3 also shows the correlations between the top five\nclassifiers with age, BMI and Neck-BMD. No significant\ncorrelations were found between any of these classifiers\nand either age or BMI and, for the top three, there was also\nno significant correlation with Neck-BMD (P > 0.05). The\nfifth placed classifier, fractal analysis of the parallel profile\nin the upper neck region, was the only one significantly\nassociated with Neck-BMD (P = 0.034).\nA three-way analysis of variance was used to examine dif-\nferences in performance due to the region, profile or type\nof analysis used. It showed that overall PCA analysis per-\nformed significantly better than fractal analysis (P =\n0.019) and that analysis of both the perpendicular and\ncircular profiles performed significantly better than the\nparallel profile (P = 0.003 and 0.011 respectively).

Both PCA and fractal analysis\nof the FFT data could be used to discriminate successfully\nbetween the groups, although overall PCA was\nsignificantly stronger than fractal dimension. The best\nresults from this study were not significantly correlated\nwith femoral neck-BMD, age or BMI, indicating their\npotential for use as an independent predictor of fracture.\nComparison of ROC curvesFigure 4\nComparison of ROC curves.

As\nthere was no significant difference in the BMI of the frac-\nture and control groups, it is unlikely that this has influ-\nenced the results, however it is an issue that will need\naddressing in future studies.\nThe PCA method extends a method previously developed\nfor analysis of histological sections [26]. The use of ori-\nented profiles improved the performance of the analysis\nby selecting directions in which there was the most infor-\nmation about bone structure i.e. perpendicular to the pre-\nferred orientation of the trabeculae. PCA considerably\nreduces the number of variables required to characterise\nthe image via its power spectrum. For example, in this\nstudy, we start with a 256 \u00d7 256 pixel ROI (65,536 pixels),\nthe Fourier transform is performed and a profile of 128\nspatial frequency values is generated. For each profile,\nPCA was able to describe over 70 % of the variance present\nin the data using only 5 components or fewer. Overall, the\nperformance of principal components analysis was signif-\nicantly stronger than that of fractal analysis (P < 0.01).\nOne advantage of PCA that may contribute to this finding\nis the ability to summarise the information present in the\ndataset with a small number of components via an\neconomical mapping of the variance present in the data.\nIn addition, the property of orthogonality between these\ncomponents ensures that the variables generated are line-\narly independent (Fig. 5). Benefits can also be found by\nthe use of a model built on the mathematical distribu-\ntions present in the data, rather than expecting the data to\nmeet a given mathematical property, such as fitting a frac-\ntal distribution.\nPrevious studies using non-fractal analysis of the Fourier\npower spectrum have focussed on images of the spine or\nwrist, where the alignment of trabeculae is generally\northogonal [28-30]. In such images, analysis of trabecular\norientation can be performed by examining the vertical\nand horizontal sectors as the trabeculae lie predominantly\nin these directions. The trabecular structure of the femur is\nmore complicated as the trabeculae are aligned in arcs, so\nthe preferred orientation changes throughout the proxi-\nmal femur. Analysis parallel to the preferred orientation\nof the trabeculae was significantly poorer than analysis\nusing either the perpendicular or circular profiles (P <\n0.05). Analysis in the perpendicular direction was strong-\nest overall, although it was not significantly better than\nthe circular profile. This accords with the increasingly ani-\nsotropic nature of trabecular bone with aging; bone loss is\nnot evenly distributed but is lost primarily at angles per-\npendicular and oblique to the preferred orientation of the\ntrabeculae [30]. This loss heightens the risk of fracture,\nespecially if the impact is from the side, as expected from\na typical fall from standing height, as there are fewer\ntrabeculae orientated in this direction to absorb the force\nof impact.\nIn summary, this paper presents a new method for analys-\ning the structure of trabecular bone from standard radio-\ngraphs. It demonstrates that the Fourier transform can be\nused to describe structural information in images which\nmay be related to fracture, independently of BMD. This\nstudy is limited by the small size of the data set and fur-\nther analysis is needed to validate these findings. This\nshould be performed on a similar series of radiographs,\nconsisting of fracture and control subjects scanned at the\nsame resolution. The methods from this study could then\nbe applied directly to this group (without recalculating\nthe PCA) to evaluate whether they were generally applica-\nble. However the success of both this and our previous\nstudy, using similar techniques to analyse histological sec-\ntions, indicates that this may be an effective method with\nclinical utility for describing bone quality statistically in\nterms of structural parameters.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAuthor JG helped design the study, performed the image\nand data analysis and drafted the manuscript\nAuthor AS collected the data\/images used within this\nstudy and helped with writing of the paper.\nTable 4: Comparing slopeA, slopeB and slopeC.
