INTRODUCTION \nOur work aims to understand the ways in which the physical \nplacement and design of networked displays in semi-wild \nenvironments influences and facilitates coordination and \ncommunity, to inform the development of guidelines and methods \nfor future displays. It is our hypothesis that such displays can help \nfoster a sense of identity and history in communities and \ncomplement existing materials displayed publicly in communities \nwhich already aid the dissemination of news and information. \nThis notion of identity and history was explored by Mynatt et al. \n[11], who identified three critical features of a community: \n\u0001 Boundaries. A community is defined by its boundaries \n(spatial, relational, technological, institutional, etc.), which may \ninclude various degrees of membership. \n\u0001 Relationships. Communities are based on meaningful \nrelationships within the group, which define expectations and \nacceptable practices. \n\u0001 Change. Communities are dynamic and develop a sense of \nhistory as they change and evolve. \nWe have been able to see the impact of these features on digital \ndisplays ourselves with the assistance of residents in Wray (Figure \n1), a village situated 16km from Lancaster in the North West of \nEngland covering a geographical area of approximately 2km2. It is \na vibrant community with a mix of attractive historic stone \ncottages and some newer developments on the edge of the village \nwhere farms and other rural industries used to reside. There are \naround 120 houses with a total population of under 500 \nrepresenting all age groups, but with a slight bias towards the \nolder generation. \n  \nFigure 1. Wray Village, Lancashire. \nIn 2004, Lancaster University, in collaboration with the village \ncommunity, created a project to deploy a resilient wireless \nnetwork across the entire village\u2014the village\u2019s remote location \nmeant that their only option for Internet access had been a dial-up \nservice. Whilst the project was technology focused (centred \naround the delivery of the wireless network), at the same time it \ncreated an environment for future research projects, establishing \nstrong links between University researchers and the village \ncommunity that have continued well beyond the initial project \nitself. \nAs part of our study in the village, we have undertaken a \ntechnology probe approach [8], aiming to understand the needs of \nthe community and inspire new designs, in addition to field \ntesting our technology. This has been achieved with the \ndeployment of a simple \u2018technology seed\u2019 [8] to gather in-situ \nusage information and generate interest and ideas from the \ncommunity. In our study, the Wray Photo Display, a situated \ndisplay which allows users to view images and videos uploaded \nusing either Bluetooth or the web, served as the technology seed. \n \n \nOzCHI 2007, 28-30 November 2007, Adelaide, Australia.

INVESTIGATING THE COMMUNITY \nOur investigation in Wray used a variety of techniques which had \nproved successful in previous projects [2], including trips to the \nvillage, extensive photography of social spaces and cultural probe \npacks to gain an understanding of the community and an insight \ninto the ways in which situated displays could be utilised. A \ndiscussion of our analysis of the resulting probe data can be found \nin [4]. \nWe began our investigation in early April 2006, when one of the \nauthors undertook an observational study, involving visiting and \nphotographing community spaces with a view to understanding \nthe way messaging and information displays were utilised within \nthe community. A further visit took place in May 2006 during the \nannual Wray Fair and Scarecrow Festival, an important event in \nthe village and surrounding area, during which one of the authors \ntook photos which would later be used in our first Photo Display \ndeployment. \n  \nFigure 2. Probe packs being distributed in Wray and a \ncompleted pack. \nMuch of our work in Wray was enabled by the help of Chris \nConder, a local technology enthusiast who championed our cause \nto members of the community, particularly through the Computer \nClub which she organises. We distributed ten probe packs during \ntwo meetings with the club at the end of April and beginning of \nMay, containing cameras and notebooks for participants to record \ntheir views on village life. \nFrom both our own observations and the contents of the probe \npacks, we noted several areas serving as key social spaces within \nthe community. The village hall in particular is the main social \nfocal point in the village and rooms in the building are used by a \nvariety of groups for different purposes, including as a doctors\u2019 \nsurgery and cinema. There are also unlocked notice boards \noutside the building (captured by a probe pack in Figure 2). The \nvillage post office is another important social space, with many \nnotices and adverts displayed across several surfaces. In addition \nto noticeboards, we saw a large number of historical photographs \ndisplayed in the village hall (Figure 3) and in a local pub.  \nTowards the end of May, we met again with members of the \nComputer Club. Inspired by the large number of historical \nphotographs already being displayed publicly in social spaces \naround the village, we suggested an adapted version of our \nHermes Photo Display [3]\u2014a situated touchscreen display which \nrotates through images uploaded by users with Bluetooth mobile \nphones\u2014as a seed technology. \n \nFigure 3. Historical photos displayed in the village hall. \n3. THE TECHNOLOGY PROBE \nIn fitting with the technology probe approach, this would be a \n\u2018good enough\u2019 deployment, with limited functionality and no \nrigorous usability testing beforehand. Our intention was that the \ndisplay would be formative, with new features and design \nimprovements spurred directly by user feedback and observation. \nAs a result, a certain degree of expectation management proved to \nbe an important factor in the design process; while residents \nhoped for a high level of functionality, the technology probe \napproach necessitates the deployment of a simple and flexible \nseed to allow it to adapt to the needs of its environment. We did, \nhowever, recognise the importance of reliability in the probe \ntechnology; we believed that residents would quickly lose interest \nin an unreliable deployment and see any future displays as equally \nunreliable. \nThroughout the probe deployment, the display logged all user \ninteraction for later analysis and users were encouraged to write in \na comments book left by the display to express their opinions. \n3.1 First Deployment \nWhen first deployed in early August 2006, the Photo Display \napplication was nearly identical to previous incarnations of the \nsystem. The only major addition was a web interface to satisfy a \nrequirement elicited from discussions with the Computer Club, \nwho wished to be able to view a current screenshot of the display \non the web at all times.  \nThe web interface was further expanded due to our own concerns \nthat inappropriate content could be posted to the display, \npotentially having a negative effect on the acceptance of the \ndisplay and relations between the University and Wray. We felt \nthat moderation of the content by a member of the community \nitself would be the most appropriate way to avoid this and \ndeveloped a small web application accessible by Chris and our \nteam, which would allow administrators to approve or reject all \nphotos before they were displayed. The application also allowed \nadministrators to upload images using the website. Chris added \nher photos of the Scarecrow Festival shortly after the display was \ndeployed, once networking issues were resolved. \nThe display was initially placed inside the village hall (Figure 4) \non Chris\u2019s suggestion. It was believed that the volume of traffic \ngenerated by various activities would ensure exposure for the \ndisplay and the building\u2019s mesh box provided excellent Internet \nconnectivity.  \n19 \n \n  \nFigure 4. Users interact with the display in the village hall. \n3.2 Early Improvements \nWithin the first month of deployment several changes were made \nto the display, resulting in the version on which the majority of \nour analysis is based. The village Produce Show in mid-August \n2006 allowed us to gather immediate feedback from members of \nthe community and generated a large number of entries in an A4 \nwriting pad placed next to the display as a comments book.  \nMost common amongst the early feedback was a request for an \n\u2018Old Photos\u2019 category; we quickly added categorisation to the \ndisplay, with categories controlled by the administrators. An \u2018Old \nPhotos\u2019 category was added soon afterwards by Chris and \npopulated by around 200 historical images. Categories have \nsubsequently proved to be a useful method for providing insights \ninto the aspects of community life which are most important to \nresidents. \nWe also spoke to an elderly resident who found small thumbnails \non the screen difficult to see; this led to the decision that touching \na thumbnail should display the image at full size in a dialog box. \nAlthough we had originally intended that uploads to the display \nwould be through Bluetooth, the majority seemed nonplussed by \nthe technology (this impression would be confirmed by our \nlogging results, as we will see) and displayed much greater \ninterest in uploading to the display from the web. In light of this, a \nmore robust web application was developed to provide all users \nwith the ability to register with the system and upload images \nthrough their browser. \nUsers also requested the ability to control their own categories\u2014\nspecifically one user who wished to share his wildlife \nphotography. This led to a concept of delegated moderation, in \nwhich users would become responsible for moderating categories \nwhich they create. While Chris was responsible for approving \ncategories, the owner took responsibility for both maintenance \nand content of the category. Category owners were additionally \nallowed to disable uploads by users other than themselves. \n \n \nFigure 5. The display after relocation to the village post office.  \nThe use of a trusted administrator to approve categories ensures \nthat only trusted individuals can become moderators. There has \nalready been an instance in which a category was rejected, as \nChris did not know the creator. \nAt the start of October 2006, once the display was well-\nestablished in the village and considered reliable, Chris moved the \ndisplay to the village post office (Figure 5). Although the village \nhall was frequently visited, it was not always accessible to the \npublic. Furthermore, the room\u2019s future was uncertain, due to the \npending installation of a PC suite. \nAs the only shop in the village, the post office installation ensured \nthe display would be seen by a large number of residents and \nwould remain accessible any time the post office was open, with \nthe added security benefit of constant supervision by the post \noffice staff. We were additionally able to locate the display next to \na public notice board (visible on the left in Figure 5), increasing \nits association with community life. \n4. TECHNOLOGY APPROACH \nThe display consists of three main elements: a Java application \nwhich is visible at all times on the touchscreen and controls \nBluetooth interaction; a set of PHP webpages which allow \nadministration of the display and image uploads; and a web server \nand database which store images and associated meta-data. A \ndiagram of the full system architecture is shown in Figure 6. \n \nFigure 6. Architecture of the Photo Display system.  \nThe display runs entirely on an Apple Mac Mini under Windows \nXP. These machines were chosen for their small form factor and \nnear-silent operation; this allows them to be situated almost \nanywhere without creating an intrusive presence.  \nWe believed that the lack of a visible computer would also help \nthe display to be seen as a natural presence, like a noticeboard, \nrather than a computer. Although the 19\u201d touchscreen display \nused with the deployment is quite clearly a PC monitor when \nstood on its base, rendering the illusion somewhat less than \ncomplete, there has been no feedback relating to this. There has \nbeen some discussion about wall-mounting the display, though we \nhave encountered resistance to any permanent fixtures in previous \nprojects, for fear of leaving visible damage which outlives the \ndeployment. \n4.1 Gallery Application \nThe main section of the system is the Java application displayed \non the touch screen. As with its predecessor system, this displays \n20 \n \ngalleries of thumbnail images (Figure 7), which the user is able to \nbrowse back and forwards through. If the screen is left \nunattended, it will scroll through galleries at 20 second intervals. \nIn addition, users can skip directly to a certain category of images. \nWhen selecting a category, normal image thumbnails are replaced \nwith thumbnails of the first image in each category. Touching a \ncategory displays its description in the centre of the screen, with a \nbutton to open the category. \n \nFigure 7. The main gallery screen displaying images from the \nScarecrow Festival 2006. \n \nFigure 8. Large image and controls launched when a \nthumbnail is touched. \nWhen a thumbnail in the gallery is touched, a large dialog is \ndisplayed containing the full-sized image (Figure 8) and options \nto view comments and statistics, or download the image to a \nmobile phone using Bluetooth. If the user opts to download to a \nmobile, the display will scan the area for discoverable devices and \nthe user can select their device from a list to initiate a transfer. \nImages can also be uploaded directly to the display using a normal \nBluetooth OBEX file transfer.  \n4.2 Web Application \nThe PHP web application allows users to register and log in to the \nsystem, providing them with the ability to upload photographs and \nvideos. Batch uploads, a requirement voiced by Chris after \nuploading the first group of images one at a time, are possible by \nuploading a ZIP file of images. \nUsers are also able to request categories through the website, \nmoderate images that have been uploaded to their categories and \nedit category settings such as title and description. Category \nowners also have the choice to allow public uploads or not, or to \ntemporarily disable a category entirely. They may also edit \ncomments or delete individual images if necessary. \nUsers designated as administrators are able to approve new \ncategories and are additionally granted owner privileges on all \ncategories, with the exception of moderation. \n4.3 Database and Web Server \nThe web application runs on an Apache web server, with a \nMySQL database storing meta-data for images and category \ninformation used by both applications. Due to the experimental \nnature of the network in Wray the display was required to run in \ndisconnected mode to remain reliable. Consequently, the display \nmachine itself acts as the server so network problems only impede \nweb access and not the functionality of the situated display (see \nFigure 6). \n5. FEEDBACK FROM THE PROBE \nFeedback on the display from members of the community is the \nprimary source of data from our probe. This was gathered firstly \nusing a comments book kept with the display, which generated \napproximately fifty individual comments from residents between \nAugust 2006 and May 2007. Secondly, we were able to take \nadvantage of the increased village activity during the annual Wray \nFair in May 2007 by temporarily deploying a second display, \nallowing researchers to observe the way users interacted with the \ndisplay and interview them in a semi-wild environment. \nResidents who we have not had the opportunity to meet have still \nbeen able to contribute feedback, often emailing their comments \nthrough Chris Conder.  \nWe also gathered usage data through automatic logging of all \ninteraction with the display into a database. This has captured \n19,000 records of interaction events such as selecting an image, \nchanging the category or using Bluetooth, affording us a method \nof gauging user interest, both during the deployment and in later \nanalysis. \n5.1 Log Data \nTo measure the amount of display interaction, we considered view \nevents (a user touches a thumbnail to view the larger image), \nnavigation events (a user has pressed the back or forward button) \nand Bluetooth events (uploads and downloads). Although we \nwould have liked the application to identify individual users and \nlog when a new session begins and ends, this would have added \ncomplexity to the display interface. \n \nFigure 9. Number of image views per month. \n21 \n \nFigure 9 shows the number of view events per month between \nSeptember 2006 and May 2007. The large leap in image views in \nOctober followed the display\u2019s relocation from the village hall to \nthe post office. After this, usage showed a decline to a steady level \nof between 300 and 500 image views a month. View events \naveraged 25 per day over the entire period.  \nIt should be noted that the figure for May covers only the first \nnine days of the month. Due to the Scarecrow Festival, usage was \nunusually high. Most results from August were accidentally \ndeleted and are therefore not included in our figures, although \nusage levels were similar to the monthly average. \nMuch to our surprise, we found events which hadn\u2019t occurred to \nbe more interesting than those which had. Our logs showed very \nfew navigation events\u2014only 153 in total. Around 100 of these \ntook place on the first day of logging and can be attributed to \ntesting and the remainder fall into nine discrete periods of activity, \neach only a few minutes in duration. So, despite relatively high \nusage overall, very few users are browsing the display. \nFurthermore, logs showed a near complete lack of Bluetooth \ninteraction. Across all nine months of logging, there were only \nfour successful downloads, 33 failures, five cancelled downloads \nand no uploads. This is not altogether surprising; although many \nphones are Bluetooth equipped, actual usage is perhaps not as \nwidespread in the UK as it is in other countries such as Africa \n[10]. As we saw previously, residents involved with the project \npreferred the web interface, so little emphasis was given to \nBluetooth interaction in the final user interface or in the \npromotion of the display to community members.  \n5.2 Comments Book \nFeedback obtained via the comments book has been \noverwhelmingly positive, with users particularly praising the \npotential utility of the display. The appeal seemed to be universal; \nsome users opted to leave their name and age, showing an age \nrange from just three years, through to 96.  \nThe fifty entries in the book were replete with ideas for possible \nextensions and novel uses for the display, which we shall \nsummarise in this section. \n5.2.1 Historical Photos \nAs mentioned previously, one of the earliest and by far most \nnumerous requests was for historical photos of the village to be \nposted on the display (\u201cit would also be good to see some of the \nolder photos of days gone by\u201d, \u201cplease could we see some old \nphotos of how the village used to look?\u201d, \u201cwould be great to see \nsome of the historical pictures of the village\u201d). \nThis, in part, led to the development of separate categories for the \ndisplay, allowing historical photos to be grouped together. The \nnew category was quickly populated with pictures of village \nbuildings and school photographs of various ages, as well as \nspecific historic events, such as the installation of electricity lines \nin the village and damage done by a serious flood. \nAn additional comment received by email summed up the general \nopinion of residents: \u201cThe digital notice board has many \nadvantages for the village... there are quite a few new people in \nthe village and this gives them an insight as to what Wray used to \nlook like, although visually it has not changed very much. The \nflood photos are one way the old and newer village can be seen. \nAlso the photos of the previous villagers i.e. school photos, \nweddings, industries carried out in Wray (which many newcomers \nwill probably not be aware of) and just local characters are \ninvaluable in the history of Wray.\u201d \nIn this we see the importance of not only the sense of history and \nchange, one of the three identified features of communities, but \nalso the boundaries and relationships which define membership \nand entrance into a community.  \nOne comment invoked the notion of change particularly well: \u201cA \ngreat way of recording a living history of Wray\u201d.  \n5.2.2 Village Life \nMany users expressed satisfaction with the ability to view \nphotographs of recent village events. This included not only those \nwho had participated in the events (\u201cgood to see the scarecrows \nagain\u201d), but also those who were absent (\u201cI missed the last couple \nof days of the Scarecrow Festival and this gives me the \nopportunity to see some of the activities and scarecrows I \nmissed\u201d). \nUsers also thought that this would be an excellent way for visitors \nand new members of the community to gain an insight into village \nlife (\u201cwhat a superb idea, especially for those who are new to the \nvillage\u201d). This strongly links to the notion of community \nboundaries and membership and the process of \u201capprenticeship\u201d \nand \u201clearning the ropes\u201d which we had previously encountered \nevaluating the display with the University\u2019s Climbing Club [15]. \n5.2.3 Communications and Advertising \nAnother recurring suggestion was the use of the display as a \ndigital noticeboard to announce community events and news. \nMany comments already referred to the display as a noticeboard, \neven though it was not designed with this functionality in mind.  \nRegardless, it was seen as an innovative way of disseminating \nimportant social information to the community (\u201cgood way to find \nout what is going on in the village, dates and times etc.\u201d, \u201cit will \naid communications at all levels, from bus timetables to social \nevents\u201d, \u201cwhat an excellent way of keeping everyone informed of \nwhat\u2019s on\u201d). Two separate comments suggested an online version \nof the village newsletter (\u201ccan it be extended into an onscreen \nversion of Wrayly Mail or village notice board\u201d, \u201cendless \npossibilities\u2026 online Wrayly Mail\u201d). \nSeveral comments also suggested commercial advertising in \naddition to community announcements (\u201cwhat about selling \nadvertising space to villagers\u201d, \u201cI would like the noticeboard to \nshowcase local businesses\u201d), along with the suggestions of \ncommunity uses for revenue generated (\u201cproceeds to a village \ncharity\u201d). \n5.2.4 Location Suggestions \nTwo local businesses, a tea room and an online services business, \nindicated an interest in having their own displays (\u201cI would be \ninterested in having one at the tea rooms\u201d, \u201cdigital noticeboard \nlooks great, can we have one?\u201d). The tea room was another \nlocation which we had identified as an important social space, \nwhich could be especially suited for a display deployment. \n5.2.5 Audio Content \nSeveral users requested audio content in addition to videos, both \nfor accessibility purposes (\u201ccould you consider an audio version \nfor the visually impaired?\u201d) and for general interest and \nentertainment (\u201cI think it would be great to have podcasts on the \n22 \n \nnotice board\u201d). This was again linked to historical content; one \nuser cited a story told by an elderly resident about the first time \nchips were sold in the village by her father as a possible example. \nAlthough this is not technically challenging, the situated nature of \nthe displays does present problems. Depending on the particular \nlocation of the display, audio content could become an \nannoyance. In the current post office deployment, the interests of \nthe staff need to be taken into account. \n5.2.6 Content Sharing \nOne user expressed an interest in using the display to share \ncontent with other members of the community (\u201cI\u2019d like to share \nmy pictures with the village and see if any of the villagers have \nany wildlife photos\u201d).  \nThis was another factor in the decision to add categories to the \ndisplay and led to the idea of category \u2018ownership\u2019 and delegated \nmoderation, in which a normal user, rather than a member of our \nteam, would moderate submissions and accept responsibility for \nthe content of categories. \n5.2.7 Games  \nA number of comments from younger users requested that games \nbe added to the display (\u201cI would like the computer to have games \nand videos on it as well\u201d, \u201cI would like to see games\u201d). It may be \nworth considering whether a \u2018fun\u2019 element could be incorporated \ninto the display, such as puzzles based on submitted images. \n5.3 Wray Fair Deployment \nIn May 2007, we were able to present our display at the annual \nWray Fair. This gave us an opportunity to speak to users who had \nbeen using the display on a regular basis\u2014including those who \nhad uploaded large numbers of photos and moderated \ncategories\u2014as well as visitors to the village using the display for \nthe first time. \n5.3.1 User Feedback \nAgain, we found that the historical photos of the village generated \nthe most interest, particularly in those who remembered the events \nportrayed. Especially popular were images of the Wray flood of \n1967; we spoke to one resident who was evacuated from the \nvillage as a child and another who recognised damaged buildings \nhe had helped to tear down. Users also enjoyed identifying now-\nadult residents on school photographs. However, when they were \nunable to recall details themselves, users were frustrated with the \nlack of meta-data available under the \u2018comments\u2019 section of the \ndisplay. Currently, this only displays comments added during \nupload (frequently none), while users would prefer to be able to \nadd their own comments and memories. \nDiscussions with several users resonated with written comments \nand the critical features of communities identified previously. \nMany felt that the display would be good for new residents and \nthat it recorded a \u201cliving history\u201d of the village. They also noted \nthat the display offered greater capacity and safety than a physical \nphoto album. \nA great deal of interest was expressed in having a fully browsable \ngallery on the website, rather than just administrative functions. \nThis request was made by both local residents and visitors who \nwould like to view photos from outside Wray. \nWe also spoke to users who felt that the post office was not an \nideal location for the display and others who had seen it but not \ninteracted with it. They described their normal trips to the post \noffice as \u201cin and out\u201d transactions, during which they would not \ntake the time to pay attention to the display or interact with it. One \nuser suggested the village hall, where the display had previously \nbeen located with less success, as a more suitable location. \n5.3.2 Observation of Interaction \nThe fair also gave us an opportunity to observe a large and varied \ngroup of users interacting with the user interface. This proved \nespecially useful in spotting unintuitive features and bad \ninteraction designs. \nThe most common problem we saw occurred on the category \nselection screen (Figure 10), where users expected touching a \nthumbnail to open the category, when they are actually required to \ntouch a \u2018View Category\u2019 button. This was not an unreasonable \nexpectation on their part, given that an equivalent action on the \nmain screen opens an image for viewing.  \n \nFigure 10. Category selection screen showing interaction \npoints. \nOur original motivation for this design was to allow a category \ndescription to be displayed in the centre of the screen, but users \ndid not appear interested in this information, seemingly finding \ntitles under the thumbnails informative enough to make a \nselection. Even after touching the thumbnail was unsuccessful, \nusers would touch it repeatedly rather than read the central area. \nWe also saw that users would spend time looking at each picture \nin turn, which involves the repetitive process of touching each one \nand closing each dialog manually. The ability to browse through \nimages within the image viewing dialog might save time if users \nare interested in viewing many pictures within the same category. \n6. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK \nAs seen in the previous section, we were able to identify a number \nof patterns in the data collected from our probe, which suggest \ndirections in which we can proceed with the design of future \nversions of the Photo Display and other displays which may be \ndeployed in the community.  \nWhile the current display has proved popular, our study has \nhighlighted a number of ways in which the display could fulfil a \nlarger role in the community, ways in which its use has defied our \nexpectations and problems with the design. As we saw in the \nprevious section, users have been particularly forthcoming with \n23 \n \nfunctionality suggestions. We plan to refine the feedback received \nso far with direct help from the community; we are currently \nplanning a questionnaire and design session, with which we to \ngauge the community\u2019s opinion of possible changes. \nThis section will detail a number of particular issues we identified \nwhich we believe to be most significant and hope to address with \nfuture studies in Wray. \n6.1 Comments and Metadata \nMetadata is an area which we feel could be vastly improved in the \ndisplay. The images contained on the display form part of a rich \nshared heritage and users clearly attach a vast amount of meaning \nto them which the display is not currently capable of supporting.  \nTaking inspiration from online communities, we hope to \ninvestigate various interaction techniques, both situated and web-\nbased, for commenting on photographs. \u2018Tagging\u2019 photographs \nwith keywords is one technique which we believe could be \nespecially useful for categorising images.  \n6.2 User Interaction \nThough usage of the device was high, interaction has not always \nbeen in the ways we expected. While observing user interaction, \nwe saw that users rarely paid attention to information displayed in \nthe central panel of the screen. The navigation buttons, which saw \nlimited usage, are also located in this area. We plan to reconsider \nthe placement, and indeed necessity, of some of the information \nand controls currently displayed in the central panel. This is a \nproblem which can best be addressed using our design session. \nWe have also seen that the web interface is a mode of access \nthrough which users are ready to contribute to situated display \ncontent. This could be greatly expanded to provide more features \nand better management of images. \n6.3 Perception of the Display \nFeedback and suggestions from community members, as well as \nthe terminology used to refer to the display, shows that it is seen \nas potentially more than just an image gallery. Frequently, users \nreferred to the display as a \u201cnotice board\u201d, suggesting that they \nmay see the display as able to offer a greater service to the \ncommunity. Requests for advertising space for both local \nbusinesses and village events echoed this. \nWe\u2019ve also seen, repeatedly, that members of the community \nbelieved the display could be used to record a \u201cliving history\u201d of \nthe village and help to integrate new residents into the \ncommunity. We believe that future developments should cater to \nthese desires to the greatest extent possible, in order to maximise \nthe display\u2019s utility in the community. \n6.4 Technical Issues \nBroadly speaking, as a field test of our technology the Photo \nDisplay deployment was successful; there are only two areas in \nwhich we felt our implementation underperformed technically. \nAs with previous iterations of the display [3], we continued to \nfind Bluetooth to be a problematic technology. While the \npotential for interaction between mobile devices and situated \ndisplays using Bluetooth is undeniable, we have consistently \nfound the discovery process to be too slow and unreliable to offer \na satisfactory user experience. This could be a factor contributing \nto the very low utilisation of Bluetooth features, as indicated by \nthe comparatively high number of failed and cancelled \ndownloads. \nOur first attempt at adding video support to the display also \ncaused frustration, due to the Java Media Framework\u2019s lack of \nsupport for codecs commonly used by mobile devices. This \nprevented content filmed on mobile phones being uploaded to the \ndisplay. We intend to reassess our approach to video support and \ninvestigate transcoding as a means of increasing format support. \n7. RELATED WORK \nThere is a large body of existing work in the field of situated \ndisplays, including work relating to their place within social \ninteractions and communities, such as social coordination using \ndisplays [12] and enticing users to interact with displays [1], \nwhich provide an understanding of human interaction with \ndisplays that is relevant to any deployment.  \nThere have been many successful situated display developments \nworthy of note. Dynamo [9] was developed as a \u201ccommunal \nmulti-user interactive service\u201d, with a large desktop-like \nenvironment shared by many simultaneous users, to which they \ncould post and share multimedia content. The Notification \nCollage [7] likewise allowed several users to share multimedia \nsimultaneously, with the added benefit of enabling multiple, \ndistributed displays. WebWall [6] made use of public displays to \nallow users to access Web content pervasively. \nOther photo-based situated display systems exist. Romero et al. \n[13] developed a system allowing users to capture images on \nmobile devices and view them on a situated display, although this \nwas intended for private use within a home rather than public use \nin a community. Digital photo frames, essentially situated photo \ndisplays for the home, are now commercially available. \nChurchill et al. [5] offered an example of a situated display \ncoupled with an online community. Their CHIplace and \nCSCWplace systems were deployed at conferences, using large, \ninteractive displays that presented information from an online \ncommunity. This blurring of the separation between content \naccessed from a home PC and content available at a public \nlocation reflects an approach we began to adopt by adding a web \nportal to our Photo Display. \nOutside the field of situated displays, much work exists on the use \nof technology to support communities, including research into the \nnotion of community memory [14], in which the community \ndetermines the content of a data repository, existing \u201csimply to \nfacilitate people\u2019s direct contact and contract with each other\u201d. \nOur work also bears resemblance to web-based content sharing \ncommunities such as Flickr and YouTube. Like the Photo \nDisplay, these sites allow users to share photographs and videos, \nalthough typically the community grows around the content while \nthe reverse is true of our system. While there are clearly different \nrequirements for online and village communities, their approaches \nmay be adaptable for a situated environment. \n8. CONCLUDING REMARKS \nWe have presented the Wray Photo Display, a situated photo \ndisplay currently deployed in a small village community as a \ntechnology probe, aiming to investigate how public displays can \ncomplement existing non-digital displays to deliver information \nand help foster a sense of identity and history. \n24 \n \nOur analysis of feedback from automatic usage logging, written \ncomments and direct interaction with users has demonstrated to us \nthe following key findings: \n\u0001 The display has proved to be a provocative and highly \nsuccessful tool for inspiring new development ideas from \nmembers of the community and enabling co-design of future \ndeployments with community members. \n\u0001 The use of categories in the display provided useful insights \ninto the areas of community life and village events which are \nmost important to residents.  \n\u0001 A photo display, situated in an appropriate social place in the \nvillage, has proved to be a promising technology for fostering \nnotions of community within the village and for communicating \nimportant aspects of the village community (e.g. parts of its \nhistory) to visitors. \n\u0001 Our novel approach of enabling villagers to take \nresponsibility and ownership of their own categories has, to \ndate, appeared successful in enabling user generated content and \nencouraging participation by distributing control. \nBased on the encouraging feedback from this probe, our current \naim is to continue developing the Photo Display in Wray with the \ngoal of understanding the community\u2019s needs and better fulfilling \ntheir requirements. Using our existing feedback to inform the \ndesign process, and by continuing to involve the community \nthrough questionnaires, participatory design workshops and \ncontinued observation of our seed technology, we believe that \nfuture displays can gain even greater acceptance and fill a larger \nrole within the community. \n9.
