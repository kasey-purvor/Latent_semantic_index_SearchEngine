The number of new TB cases is increasing at an alarming pace, as does the \nprevalence of drug resistant stains of the causative agent, Myobacterium tuberculosis, in \nthe form of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-\nTB) (Madariaga et al., 2008). The need for new drugs and vaccines to combat this major \nburden to human health is overwhelming. \n \nThe unique hydrophobic cell wall of M. tuberculosis forms a primary defensive barrier to \nthe onslaught of toxic insult during the host immune response. The current \nchemotherapeutic regime used to treat TB includes the administration of isoniazid and \nethambutol, both of which target crucial steps in the biosynthesis and assembly of the M. \ntuberculosis cell wall (Banerjee et al., 1994; Belanger et al., 1996). However, whilst \nthese cell wall inhibitors are excellent at effectively killing actively dividing cells, certain \nsub-populations of bacilli, labelled as \u2018persisters\u2019, exhibit transient resistance to many of \nthe drugs used to treat TB (Wayne & Sohaskey, 2001). The precise molecular mechanism \nof this latent infection caused by persistent bacilli is poorly understood. However, in the \npursuit of identifying suitable cellular targets and the development of new anti-TB \nchemotherapeutic agents, we must address the phenomenon of persistence to truly \neradicate the disease. Recently it has been shown that certain processes of metabolic \npathways involved in mycobacterial cellular energy metabolism, such as respiratory ATP \nbiosynthesis, represent excellent physiological targets for the effective killing of latent \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n4 \npopulations of TB bacilli (Bald & Koul, 2010; Koul et al., 2007; Koul et al., 2008). \nPhospho-\u03b1-D-ribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (pRpp) is a central metabolite that links the \npentose phosphate pathway to the de novo and salvage biosynthetic pathways of purine \nand pyrimidine production, NAD and NADP cofactor biosynthesis, as well as histidine \nand tryptophan biosynthesis (Hove-Jensen, 1988). It is therefore considered that pRpp is \nrequired at all times during the life cycle of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (Hove-\nJensen, 1989; Tozzi et al., 2006). In addition to these central metabolic processes \ndescribed above, members belonging to the Corynebacteriacae, such as mycobacteria, \nhave evolved an almost unique biochemical pathway, utilising pRpp as a high-energy \nbiosynthetic precursor for cell wall arabinan biosynthesis (Scherman et al., 1995; \nScherman et al., 1996; Wojtkiewicz et al., 1988) (Fig. 1). The gene product of Rv3806c \nencodes for a membrane bound pRpp:decaprenol-1-monophosphate 5-\nphosphoribosyltransferase (DPPR synthase) which catalyses the formation of decaprenol-\n1-monophosphoribose-5-phosphate (DPPR) and pyrophosphate from pRpp and \ndecaprenol-1-monophosphate (Huang et al., 2005). DPPR then undergoes C5-\ndephosphorylation to decaprenol-1-monophosphoribose (DPR) and epimerisation about \nthe C2-OH position of the ribosyl moiety catalysed by a two-step heteromeric \noxidation\/reduction process (Mikusova et al., 2005). In M. tuberculosis, Rv3790 encodes \nfor a FAD-containing oxidoreductase (DprE1) which oxidises the ribosyl C2-OH group \nto the keto sugar decaprenol-1-monophosphoryl-2-keto-\u03b2-erythro-pentofuranose (DPX) \nwhich is subsequently reduced by DprE2 (encoded by Rv3791) forming decaprenol-1-\nmonophosphoarabinose (DPA) (Mikusova et al., 2005), which is the sole high-energy \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n5 \nlipid linked substrate for the GT-C family arabinofuranosyltransferases (AraTs) which \nare involved in cell wall arabinan polymerisation (Alderwick et al., 2007). \n \nMycobacterial arabinan is a highly branched polysaccharide consisting of arabinose units \narranged into specific repeating motifs, and it predominantly features in the \nheteropolysaccharide arabinogalactan (AG), which is a crucial component of the \nmycobacterial cell wall (Besra et al., 1995; Daff\u00e9 et al., 1990). Three arabinan domains \nare covalently linked via an Araf-\u03b1(1\u21925)-Galf glycosidic bond to the 8th, 10th and 12th \npositions of a single linear polysaccharide composed of ~30 alternating \u03b2(1\u21925) and \n\u03b2(1\u21926) Galf residues forming the galactan domain of AG (Alderwick et al., 2005). AG is \na structural macromolecule and serves to function as a molecular scaffold linking \npeptidoglycan (PG) to the mycolic acids, forming a highly impermeable and hydrophobic \nlayer surrounding the mycobacterial cell (McNeil et al., 1991). Arabinan is also present \nin the form of lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a highly immunogenic lipoglycan, which is \ninvolved in modulating the host immune response (Briken et al., 2004). In terms of \nchemical composition, arabinan represents approximately 18% of mycobacterial cell wall \nbiomass (Ortalo-Magne et al., 1995). Therefore, during cell elongation and division of \nthe mycobacterial bacilli, it is necessary for there to be a readily available supply of pRpp \nfor the efficient incorporation of arabinose into newly synthesised cell wall material. \nDuring this process, the metabolic demand for pRpp is likely to increase dramatically and \nthe elevated levels required for effective arabinan biosynthesis must be maintained. The \nenzyme pRpp synthetase (ATP: \u03b1-D-ribose-5-phosphate pyrophosphotransferase; \nEC2.7.6.1) belongs to a family of enzymes that catalyse the transfer of the \u03b2,\u03b3-\n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n6 \ndiphosphate moiety from ATP to the C1-OH group of \u03b1-D-ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) and \nthe gene(s) encoding for this enzyme(s) is present in all living organisms (Carter et al., \n1997; Hove-Jensen, 1985; Krath & Hove-Jensen, 1999). It is predicted that the M. \ntuberculosis H37Rv genome codes for only one pRpp synthetase (Rv1017c), which is \nannotated as Mt-PrsA (Cole & Barrell, 1998). \n \nIn this study, we report a detailed biochemical characterisation of recombinant Mt-PrsA \nand provide evidence which confirms the essentiality of this gene for the maintenance of \ncell growth, division and integrity. Mt-PrsA displays an absolute requirement for \ninorganic phosphate for enzyme activation and will accept either Mg2+ or Mn2+ as \ndivalent cations, which serve to coordinate the phosphate moieties of ATP during enzyme \ncatalysis. Using a continuous enzyme coupled spectrophotometric assay, we report a \ndetailed kinetic characterisation of Mt-PrsA, which displays the highest specific activity \nmeasured for any a pRpp synthetase studied to date. By investigating the oligomeric state \nof Mt-PrsA in solution and measuring the ligand binding properties of its substrates, we \nprovide evidence suggesting that the mechanism by which ADP inhibits Mt-PrsA \nactivity, results from the binding of ADP to an allosteric site, and as a consequence, \ninduces the stabilisation of an inactive, hexameric oligimeric species.  \n \nResults \nEvidence suggesting that Mt-prsA is an essential gene for the maintenance of cellular \nintegrity \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n7 \nMt-prsA is predicted to be an essential gene as determined by high density transposon \nmutagenesis (Sassetti et al., 2003). This is not unsurprising, considering the apparent \nphysiological importance of Mt-PrsA in the provision of pRpp for central metabolic \npathways and the formation of the cell wall biosynthetic precursor DPA (Scherman et al., \n1995; Wolucka et al., 1994). We have previously used Corynebacterium glutamicum as \nan excellent model system for the study of complex cell wall biosynthetic processes, and \nwe have reported the phenotypic characterisation of several cell wall mutants, which \nwould otherwise be essential in mycobacterial systems (Alderwick et al., 2005; \nAlderwick et al., 2006a; Alderwick et al., 2006b; Birch et al., 2008; Gande et al., 2004; \nSeidel et al., 2007). A bioinformatics analysis of several Corynebacteriaceae genomes \nrevealed that NCgl0945 (Cg-prsA) was the likely C. glutamicum ortholog of Mt-prsA \n(Rv1017c). These corresponding gene products share 71% identity (83% similarity) and \nthe gene locus is conserved within the Corynebacteriaceae indicating that this region is \nsyntenic. We attempted to inactivate Cg-prsA in C. glutamicum, by using the disruption \nvector pK18mob-Cg-prsA-int, carrying 304 bp of Cg-prsA. In a control experiment, we \nused the previously reported pK18mob-Cg-ppm1-int construct, which affords the \nsuccessful inactivation of the gene encoding for the polyprenyl monophosphomannose \nsynthase (ppm1) of C. glutamicum, which is a gene of similar size to that of Cg-prsA \n(Gibson et al., 2003). Both inactivation vectors were used in parallel experiments for the \ntransformation of wild type (WT) C. glutamicum to kanamycin resistance (KanR). Whilst \nwe were able to easily generate C. glutamicum KanR colonies from the pK18mob-Cg-\nppm1-int construct, we were required to conduct several rounds of electroporation using \npK18mob-Cg-prsA-int before obtaining three separate C. glutamicum KanR clones. This \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n8 \nindicates that the recombination events appeared to have taken place at unexpected and, \nas yet, undefined loci. From this analysis, we concluded that Cg-prsA is an essential gene \nand its function is necessary for the growth and integrity of C. glutamicum, even when \ngrown on rich Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) medium.  \n \nOver-expression, purification and pRpp synthetase activity of recombinant Mt-PrsA \nOver-expression of Mt-PrsA in Escherica coli C41 cells and the subsequent purification \nby IMAC, resulted in a preparation of Mt-PrsA that was stable in solution at a \nconcentration of 2 mg\/ml. A coomassie-stained 12 % SDS-PAGE analysis of Mt-PrsA \nrevealed a band that migrated to a position of 35 kDa, which is in accordance with the \nexpected molecular weight of Mt-PrsA and was estimated to be at least 98% pure. To \ndetermine if recombinant Mt-PrsA was active, we performed a radiochemical assay to \nmeasure the pyrophosphate transfer from ATP to the C1-OH group of [14C]-uniformly \nlabelled R5P (Boss et al., 1984). Starting with [14C]-U-D-glucose, and replicating the first \nthree enzymic reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway in vitro using commercially \navailable enzymes (Roche and Sigma), we prepared a source of purified [14C]-U-\u03b1-D-\nribose-5-phosphate as a substrate for subsequent enzyme assays. In a time course assay, \nrecombinant Mt-PrsA exhibited rapid pRpp synthetase activity which was dependent \nupon the presence of either of the divalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+, with slight preference \nfor the latter (Fig. 2a). During the assay, p[14C]Rpp is susceptible to product degradation \ndue to hydrolysis of the labile C1-OH pyrophosphate bond, which accounts for the \nrelatively small increase in band density (relating to p[14C]Rpp) over the course of the \nassay. Addition of EDTA to the reaction mix inhibited the formation of p[14C]Rpp (data \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n9 \nnot shown) and the inclusion of CaCl2, in replacement of MgCl2 or MnCl2, also resulted \nin loss of Mt-PrsA activity (Fig 2a). Mt-PrsA was found to be most active at a pH of 6.5, \nbut also showed activity across a broad range of pH levels (4.5 \u2013 9.5) and was only found \nto be inactive at high pH (10.5) (data not shown). In accordance with previous studies of \npRpp synthetases (Prs) from other organisms, Mt-PrsA was strongly inhibited by the \npresence of ADP, which has been shown to be an allosteric modulator of this class of \nenzymes (Fig. 2b) (Arnvig et al., 1990; Eriksen et al., 2000; Gibson et al., 1982; Switzer \n& Sogin, 1973; Willemoes et al., 2000). \n \nMt-PrsA-dependent metabolic channelling of R5P into mycobacterial cell wall \nbiosynthetic precursors  \nApart from being a key metabolite in the de novo and salvage pathways of purine and \npyrimidine biosynthesis, as well as histidine, tryptophan, NAD and NADP metabolism, \npRpp serves as a high-energy intermediate in the formation of the mycobacterial cell wall \nprecursor DPR (Fig. 1) (Scherman et al., 1995). We investigated the conversion of [14C]-\nR5P into the cell wall AraT substrate DPA and its precursor, DPR. Assays were \nconducted using membranes prepared from M. smegmatis which provided a source of \nDPPR synthase (Huang et al., 2005), which was necessary to investigate incorporation of \n[14C]-R5P into lipid-linked organic extractable material. When assays were performed \nwith just [14C]-R5P and membranes, no radioactive product was detectable in the organic \nphase, as depicted in Figure 3, lane 1. In this instance, all radioactivity remained in the \naqueous phase of the assay work-up (data not shown). In addition, M. smegmatis P60 (a \npreparation of cell wall material rich in proteins associated with cell wall processes) \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n10 \nexhibited no pRpp synthetase activity (Fig. 3, lane 2). When recombinant Mt-PrsA is \nincluded in the assay, the formation of DPPR and DPR can be clearly observed (Fig. 3, \nlane 3). It is likely that DPPR undergoes enzyme catalysed 5\u2019-dephosphorylation, \nresulting in the formation of DPR. In M. tuberculosis, Rv3807c is an excellent candidate \nfor this enzyme since it codes for a putative membrane bound PAP2 phosphatase directly \nadjacent to the DPPR synthase (Rv3806c) (Fig. 1) (Cole & Barrell, 1998). M. smegmatis \nhas a direct orthologue of this phosphatase encoded by MSMEG6402, which explains the \napparent conversion of DPPR to DPR observed in this assay. The combined addition of \nsodium fluoride and sodium tungstate (known phosphatase inhibitors (Stankiewicz & \nGresser, 1988)) to the assay mix, results in a diminished level of DPR formation and a \ncorresponding increase in a band migrating to a lower position on the TLC identified as \nbeing DPPR (Fig. 3 lane 4). When Mt-PrsA is used in combination with M. smegmatis \nP60, two additional bands can be observed migrating in close proximity to DPR, which \ncorrespond to the subsequent conversion of DPR to DPX and DPA, by the endogenous \nP60 activity of DprE1 and DrpE2, respectively (Fig. 3, lane 5) (Mikusova et al., 2005). \nInclusion of sodium fluoride and sodium tungstate dramatically reduced the conversion \nof DPPR to DPA, suggesting that the two-step epimerisation of the C2-OH group of \nribose by DprE1 and DprE2 occurs after 5\u2019 dephosphorylation (Fig. 3, lane 6). The \ninclusion of ADP to the reaction mix completely ablated the formation of any organic \nextractable material, clearly indicating that ADP inhibition of Mt-PrsA results in the total \nloss of DPPR formation (Fig. 3, lane 7).  \n \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n11 \nIn a separate experiment, assays were carried out in the presence of a neo-glycolipid \nacceptor [Araf-\u03b1(1p5)-Araf-O-(CH2)CH3], which is specific for measuring the activity \nof the cell wall biosynthetic arabinofuranosyltransferases EmbA, EmbB, EmbC and AftB \n(Lee et al., 1997; Seidel et al., 2007), all of which reside in the membrane due to the \npolytopic nature of these GT-C family glycosyltransferases. AraT activity was measured \nafter product isolation by organic extraction and analysis by TLC and autoradiography. \nAraT assays carried out in the absence of Mt-PrsA afforded no AraT-dependent product \nformation (Fig. 4, lane 1). Upon addition of Mt-PrsA, two closely migrating bands could \nbe observed with the top bad attributed to \u03b1(1p5)-Araf transfer to the acceptor by either \nEmbA, EmbB, EmbC (or a combination) and the lower band attributed to \u03b2(1p2)-Araf \ntransfer resulting from AftB activity (Fig. 4, lane 2), as previously described (Lee et al., \n1997). Addition of the EmbA, EmbB and EmbC inhibitor ethambutol (EMB), resulted in \nthe loss of the upper band with only the lower band remaining, this being due to the non-\ninhibitory effect of EMB on the terminal \u03b2(1p2) capping enzyme, AftB (Seidel et al., \n2007) (Fig. 4, lane 3). As a consequence of allosteric inhibition of Mt-PrsA and the \nresultant loss of in vitro Mt-PrsA-dependent pRpp formation, the inclusion of ADP in the \nassay mixture led to inhibition of any AraT-dependent product formation (Fig. 4, lane 4). \n \nKinetic characterisation of Mt-PrsA substrates and inhibitors using a continuous \nspectrophotometric assay. \nDue to the rapid enzymic activity of recombinant Mt-PrsA using the radioactive assay \npreviously described, we sought to link Mt-PrsA catalysed AMP product release to a \nthree-enzyme coupled assay system, thus enabling us to measure NADH oxidation at 340 \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n12 \nnm in a continuous spectrophotometric assay, which has been described similarly \nelsewhere (Braven et al., 1984). This system (described in Material and Methods) \nenabled us to record detailed measurements of the steady-state enzyme kinetics of Mt-\nPrsA. Plotting the steady state reaction velocity (\u03bd) calculated from equation 1, as a \nfunction of increasing concentrations of R5P at saturating levels of ATP, results in a \nhyperbolic curve displaying Michelis-Menton kinetics (Fig. 5A). Nonlinear regression \nanalysis using equation 2 derived a Km of 8.2 \u00b5M (\u00b1 2.72 Std. Error) for R5P and a Vmax \nof 530 \u00b5mol-1.min-1.mg-1 and a specificity constant (Kcat\/Km) of 7.43 \u00d7 106 M-1.s-1. As \npreviously described using the radiochemical assay, Mt-PrsA requires the presence of Pi \nat a concentration of 50 mM for full enzyme activation, which is illustrated in Fig. 5A. \nHowever, at reduced levels of Pi (5 mM), the subsequent addition of R5P results in \npartial substrate inhibition, an effect that has been observed elsewhere (Willemoes et al., \n2000) (data fitted to equation 3), with little or no activity recorded in the absence of Pi \n(Fig. 5A). This is likely due to Mt-PrsA being incompletely activated by Pi at low [Pi], \nmeaning that at low R5P concentrations the relatively high-affinity catalytic site for R5P \nis occupied and normal Micheli-Menton kinetics occur until R5P reaches a concentration \nthat results in the occupancy of a second low-affinity inhibitory site which would \notherwise be occupied by Pi at higher [Pi]. Kinetic analysis of Mt-PrsA with increasing \nATP concentrations at saturating levels of R5P results in a sigmoidal response showing \npositive cooperativity (Fig. 5b). Data obtained from measuring \u03bd against increasing \nconcentrations of ATP at various Pi concentrations was fitted to equation 4. At activating \nlevels of [Pi] (50 mM), the S0.5 and Vmax for ATP was calculated as being 62.65 \u00b5M (\u00b1 \n12.04 Std. Error) and 601 \u00b5mol-1.min-1.mg-1 (\u00b1 66.39 Std. Error) respectively. An \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n13 \napparent Hill-coefficient (n) of 1.68 indicates strong positive cooperativity during \nincreasing [ATP]. However, when fitted to equation 4 using nonlinear regression \nanalysis, this effect diminishes at low [Pi] resulting in a \u03bd vs [ATP] response with altered \nkinetic constants (Fig. 5b). It has been reported elsewhere that Prs enzymes from other \norganisms are allosterically inhibited by the presence of ADP (Arnvig et al., 1990; \nEriksen et al., 2000; Gibson et al., 1982; Switzer & Sogin, 1973; Willemoes et al., 2000). \nWe measured the effect of ADP on \u03bd as a function of increasing [R5P] and [ATP]. At \nsaturating concentrations of ATP, the addition of ADP resulted in non-competitive \ninhibition of Mt-PrsA with a calculated Ki of 320 \u00b5M (\u00b1 53.51 Std. error) against \nincreasing [R5P] (data fitted to equation 5) (Fig. 6a). When we measured the effect of \nADP on the kinetic response of Mt-PrsA to increasing [ATP] and subsequent fitting of \nthe data to equation 6 (Fig. 6b), we calculated a Ki of 522 \u00b5M (\u00b1 45.78 Std. Error).  \n \nBiophysical characterisation of Mt-PrsA: oligomeric state and ligand binding \nstudies \nMt-PrsA homologues from other organisms have been reported to aggregate in solution \nin various homo-oligomeric states, ranging from dimer to octamer (Arnvig et al., 1990; \nLi et al., 2007; Schubert et al., 1975). Using analytical ultracentrifugation, we performed \na set of sedimentation velocity experiments on Mt-PrsA in the absence or presence of \nR5P, ATP and ADP at a saturating concentrations (Fig. 7). Analysis of each experiment \nby interpretation of the molar mass distribution c(M), indicates that Mt-PrsA in solution \nalone, reaches a dynamic equilibrium between two molecular species with peaks centred \nover ~ 100,000 Da and ~ 205,000 Da, which relate to Mt-PrsA in a trimeric and \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n14 \nhexameric aggregation state respectively (Fig. 7, black line). The inclusion of 5 mM R5P \nshowed no apparent change in the equilibrium or oligomeric state of Mt-PrsA in solution, \nand the c(M) vs Mw distribution aligned well with that of Mt-PrsA in the absence of \nligand (Fig. 7, red line). The addition of 5 mM ATP to Mt-PrsA resulted in an altered \nc(M) distribution with a peak centred over ~ 70,000 Da, equating to a Mt-PrsA \nhomodimer, and concomitant reduction in the intensity of the hexameric species, as \ncompared to Mt-PrsA alone (Fig. 7, blue line). Interestingly, when we performed a \nsimilar experiment in combination with 5 mM ADP, the ratio of c(M) distribution shifted \ntowards an increase in the hexameric state with a corresponding reduction in trimeric \nspecies (Fig. 7, green line). Mt-PrsA contains within its primary amino acid sequence, \nthree naturally occurring tryptophan residues at position Trp 5, Trp 74 and Trp 188. We \nused Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence (ITF) spectroscopy to probe the binding \nproperties of R5P, ATP and ADP for Mt-PrsA. We performed a fluorescence emission \n(Femission) scan of Mt-PrsA in solution by recording (Femission) output between 300 and 400 \nnm, upon excitation at \u03bb292nm. Mt-PrsA gave a maximum fluorescence emission \n(Femissionmax) at a wavelength of 335 nm, thus providing a basal Femission coordinate for the \ncollection of subsequent ITF data. The change in fluorescence emission (\u2206Femission) was \ncalculated by subtracting the Femission (recorded 5 min after each ligand titration) away \nfrom (Femissionmax), and the data was then plotted against [L]. Nonlinear regression \nanalysis of \u2206Femission vs [R5P] using equation 7 shows a hyperbolic isothermal ligand \nbinding curve for R5P, with a calculated Kd of 24.8 \u00b5M (\u00b1 6.77 Std. Error) (Fig. 8a). We \nsought to investigate what effect ATP might have on the Kd for R5P, however, the \ninclusion of both ATP and R5P would obviously result in enzyme catalysis and the \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n15 \nformation of pRpp and AMP. Due to the relatively high specific activity of Mt-PrsA, the \naddition of R5P and ATP at concentrations required for the effective measurement of \nligand binding constants by ITF would result in a reaction that would go to completion \nwithin the 5 min time-frame required to establish binding equilibrium. Therefore, due to \nthe stability of the imido-diphophate moity and lack of enzyme-catalysed phosphate \ntransfer, we used the ATP analogue 5'-adenylyl-\u03b2,\u03b3-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP) as an \nATP ligand substitute for binding assays, when carried out in conjunction with R5P. Mt-\nPrsA was titrated with increasing [AMPPNP] using identical increments carried out \nduring ATP ligand binding experiments. Subsequent nonlinear regression analysis and \ncomparison of the \u2206Femission vs [AMPPNP] and \u2206Femission vs [ATP] plots (data not shown) \nresulted in a strong correlation (R2 = 0.986) as well as extremely similar dissociation \nconstants of 28.29 \u00b5M (\u00b1 0.54 Std. Error) and 31.02 \u00b5M (\u00b1 0.62 Std. Error) for ATP and \nAMPPNP respectively. With similarly calculated Hill-coefficients (n) of ~4, the almost \nidentical binding properties of ATP and AMPPNP for Mt-PrsA allowed us to confidently \nsubstitute AMPPNP for ATP during binding assays carried out in combination with R5P. \nIn this regard, when R5P was titrated against Mt-PrsA in the presence of 5 mM \nAMPPNP, the apparent Kd for R5P decreased to 21.36 \u00b5M (\u00b1 4.84 Std. Error). This data \nindicates that the Mt-PrsA-AMPPNP complex exhibits a slightly higher affinity for R5P \nwhen compared to Apo-Mt-PrsA (Fig. 8a). In the reverse experiment where \u2206Femission vs \n[AMPPNP] was measured in the presence or absence of 5 mM R5P (Fig. 8b), the affinity \nof Mt-PrsA-R5P for AMPPNP increased slightly, as is evident from the reduction in Kd \nto 28.22 \u00b5M (\u00b1 0.54 Std. Error) and an increase in the Hill-coefficient (n) to 5 by a value \nof 1. In light of the previous AUC experiment, which suggests that the addition of ADP \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n16 \ninduces a shift towards Mt-PrsA hexamerisation, we performed an ITF experiment by \ntritrating Mt-PrsA with increasing  [ADP] (Fig. 9a). Unsurprisingly, the \u2206Femission vs \n[ADP] plot displays a sigmoidal cooperative binding response with an apparent Kd of \n512.6 \u00b5M (\u00b1 39.57 Std. Error) and a Hill-coefficient of 2. Since ATP and ADP bind to \nMt-PrsA at separate sites, and induce very different aggregation states, the apparent ~2 \nfold difference in the Fmax recorded for ATP and ADP is most likely due to the differing \neffects each of these ligands have on the chemical environments surrounding the \ntryptophan residues providing the source of Femission in Mt-PrsA (Eriksen et al., 2000). \nThe inclusion of ADP at two different concentrations (0.1 and 2.0 mM) in separate ITF \n[ATP] ligand binding assays, causes a significant increase in the apparent Kd of ATP for \nits Mt-PrsA binding site (KdATP = 31.22 \u00b5M and 90.1 \u00b5M at a concentration of 0.1 and 2.0 \nmM ADP respectively), clearly illustrating allosteric inhbition of Mt-PrsA-ATP complex \nformation (Fig. 9b). The change in the slope of the curve as a function of [ATP] in \nseparate ITF experiments carried out at increasing ADP concentrations, clearly illustrates \na reduction in the homotropic cooperative binding of ATP for Mt-PrsA, which was \nconfirmed by calculating the resultant Hill-coefficients (Fig. 9b). The ligand binding \nproperties of ADP for Mt-PrsA, in the presence of ATP, compares well with the \ninhibition constant calculated for ADP [Ki = 522 \u00b5M (\u00b1 45.78 Std. Error)] obtained from \nkinetic analysis of \u03bd vs [ATP] at saturating [R5P] (Fig. 6b). \n \nStructural model of Mt-PrsA \nAn alignment of Mt-PrsA with its related Corynebacterineae PrsA orthologues as well as \nothet bacterial Prs homologues from Bacillus subtilis (Bs_PrsA), Escherichia coli \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n17 \n(Ec_PrsA) and Streptomyces coleicolor (Sc_PrsA), and the three human Prs isoforms \n(Human_PrsA1-3) clearly illustrates the high level of primary sequence conservation \nbetween all variants (Fig. 10). Mt-PrsA shares very high sequence identity with its \nCorynebacterineae counterparts (92 % Mycobacterium leprae, 87 % Mycobacterium \nsmegmatis and 71 % Corynebacterium glutamicum) and a moderate level of sequence \nidentity with Mt-PrsA homologues in S. coleicolor (61 %), E. coli (43 %) and B. subtilis \n(43 %). Interestingly, the three human Prs isoforms also share 40 % sequence identity \nwith Mt-PrsA. Both of the human type 1 and B. subtilis pRpp synthetase X-ray crystal \nstructures have been solved (Eriksen et al., 2000, Sheng et al., 2007). Each of these \nstructures were solved in the Apo form and in complex with AMP, which is located in the \nATP binding pocket of the active site. Interestingly, the Bs-PrsA structure was solved in \ncomplex with an additional molecule of ADP, thus revealing its position and mode of \naction in the allosteric regulatory site of the enzyme (Eriksen et al., 2000). Since Mt-PrsA \nshares highest sequence homology with Bs-PrsA, we constructed a homology model of \nMt-PrsA using the structure of Bs-Prs in complex with AMP and ADP as a template \n(Eriksen et al., 2000) (Fig. 11). Using crystallographic symmetry data from the Bs-Prs \nstructure, we arranged the Mt-PrsA homology model into its hexameric form (Fig. 11a). \nEach monomer is composed of two subunits, which is related by a 3-fold axis \nperpendicular to an additional 2-fold planar rotational symmetry. Many of the residues \ninvolved in binding at the interface between monomers are well conserved, with notable \ndifferences highlighted by the position of red spheres in Fig. 11a. With only a few \nexceptions, the sequence alignment of Mt-PrsA and Bs-Prs indicates that most of the \nresidues involved in enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation are conserved which, in \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n18 \nturn, are suitably positioned in the Mt-PrsA homology model compared to Bs-Prs. A \nnoteworthy difference in the Mt-PrsA catalytic site is the presence of Asn45, which is \narranged to form contacts with the ADP ligand (Fig. 11b). In the Bs-Prs structure, the \nequivalent residue is Asp42. In addition, further comparison of the two structures \nsuggests that the Mt-PrsA homology model retains all of the important residues required \nfor the regulatory site, apart from Gly88 (Ala85 in Bs-Prs), which participates in the \nformation of contacts to ADP with a neighbouring Ser89 (Fig. 11b). An interesting \nobservation in the model of Mt-PrsA is the presence of His109 in the \u201cflexible loop\u201d \nformed by Mt-PrsA residues Lys108 \u2013 Arg112. Ala106 is the equivalent residue in Bs-\nPrs, and it appears to play little if no part in binding or coordination of the ADP ligand. \nThis flexible loop region, which contains many conserved residues (Fig. 10), has been \nidentified as displaying some of the largest variation in backbone conformation, and the \nconformational changes that occur upon substrate binding are considered to be important \nfor catalysis (Eriksen et al., 2000). The presence of a His residue in the Mt-PrsA flexible \nloop region might allow for multiple hydrogen bonding opportunities between His109 \nand the ATP substrate in the catalytic site (Fig. 11b). Gly111 is another conserved residue \nlocated in the flexible loop of mycobacterial PrsA enzymes, which in the majority of \nother bacterial homologues, is typically replaced by a Ser that makes H-bond interactions \nwith the \u03b1-phosphate of ADP in the allosteric site (Fig. 11c). Both the Human-PrsA1 and \nBs-PrsA homodimers are stabilised by a salt bridge at the N-terminal interface formed \nbetween two conserved residues (Asn114 and Asp139, and Asn120 and Asp145 \nrespectively) (Eriksen et al., 2000, Sheng et al., 2007). From the sequence alignment and \nMt-PrsA homology model, it is worth noting that the equivalent Asn residue is replaced \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n19 \nby an aspartic acid (Asp122) which would sit in close proximity to Asp147. Therefore, it \nis reasonable to assume that unlike Human-PrsA1 and Bs-PrsA, a salt bridge does not \noccur at the Mt-PrsA dimer interface. Interestingly, the Human-PrsA1 Asn114 (Asp122 \nin Mt-PrsA) is often mutated to a Ser in the cells of patients suffering from gout (Becker, \net al., 1995). It has been reported that the molecular mechanism behind the 50% increase \nin N114S mutant enzyme activity is caused by a disruption of a salt bridge, which would \notherwise stabilises the dimer interface (Liu et al., 2009).  \n \nDiscussion \nThe presence of D-arabinose in living organisms is rarely observed. Whilst the utilisation \nof D-arabinopyranose seems to be confined to glycoconjugate formation in \ntrypanosomatid parasites (Turnock & Ferguson, 2007), arabinose in the furanose \nconfiguration (Araf) is exclusively used by bacteria in the formation of cell surface \npolysaccharides and the biosynthesis of glycolipid antigens. Members belonging to the \nCorynebacterineae, such as M. tuberculosis and C. glutamicum, contain large quantities \nof Araf in the form of arabinan, which in turn, is covalently attached to galactan and \nmannan, thus forming AG and LAM respectively. Whilst LAM exerts its biological \nactivity by subverting the host immune response, the primary function of AG is to \nprovide a highly branched molecular scaffold, linking the murine sacculus to the \nhydrophobic mycolate layer. Since arabinan is an essential component of the TB cell wall \nand is targeted by treatment with EMB, other enzymes involved in its formation might \npresent themselves as potential putative drug-targets. In this regard, DPPR synthetase \n(Rv3806c) is a novel enzyme catalysing the transfer of pRpp to decaprenol-1-\n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n20 \nmonphosphate forming DPPR (Fig. 1) and represents the first committed step towards the \nbiosynthesis of DPA (an exclusive cell wall AraT substrate) and as a consequence of its \ngenetic disruption in C. glutamicum (a model organism used to study M. tuberculosis cell \nwall physiology), affords a phenotype displaying retarded growth, and a severely altered \ncell wall composition which is completely deficient in arabinan (Alderwick et al., 2005). \nIn addition, DprE1 (Rv3790) has been shown to be the molecular target of \nbenzothiazinones, a new class of antimycobacterial agents, which can effectively kill \nMDR and XDR strains of TB by blocking the C2-OH epimerisation of DPR to DPA \n(Makarov et al., 2009). Some of the current front line drugs used to treat TB include cell \nwall inhibitors. However, the incidence of MDR and XDR-TB cases is alarmingly high \nand continues to rise (Madariaga et al., 2008). Since the M. tuberculosis cell wall is a \nvalid drug target, we must continue to investigate the physiology, biochemistry and \nmetabolic pathways involved in its assembly, to assist our efforts of developing new anti-\nTB therapies. However, non-dividing drug-tolerant populations of \u201cpersistent\u201d TB bacilli \nfail to be eradicated from the host, giving rise to a latent infection as result of subsequent \ngranuloma formation (Barry et al., 2009). Inhibition of cell wall biosynthetic processes of \nTB bacilli responsible for latent infections is of no consequence, this being due to the fact \nthat persistent TB bacilli are not undergoing active cell growth and division. However, \nthese \u201cdormant\u201d TB-bacilli still require a basal level of \u201cenergy\u201d metabolites in order to \nmaintain critical cellular functions (Koul et al., 2008). \n \npRpp is a central metabolite ubuiquitous in nature providing a high-energy substrate for \nthe biosynthesis of histidine, tryphophan, NAD, NADP and both the de novo and salvage \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n21 \npathways involved in nucleoside metabolism (Hove-Jensen, 1988) (Fig. 1). In addition to \nthese central metabolic processes, the Corynebacterineae have evolved a unique pathway \nin which pRpp is siphoned into cell wall arabinan biosynthesis (Fig. 1). In M. \ntuberculosis, Mt-PrsA is entirely responsible for the provision of pRpp and its cellular \nfunction bridges five different metabolic pathways (Fig. 1). The omphalic nature of Mt-\nPrsA places a heavy burden on its biological function, especially during cell growth and \ndivision, when the cellular requirement for pRpp increases significantly. In this study, we \ndescribe the biochemical characterisation of Mt-PrsA, which displays the highest \nrecorded specific activity for a pRpp synthetase of 530 \u00b5mol-1.min-1.mg-1. The Km for \nR5P was calculated to be in the sub-micromolar range of (8.2 \u00b5M), suggesting a rapid \nenzyme turnover with a calculated specificity constant (Kcat\/Km) of 7.4 \u00d7 106 M-1.s-1. This \nrelatively high efficiency of Mt-PrsA fits well with the physiological function of the \nenzyme during cell wall biosynthesis, considering the increased demand for pRpp that is \nrequired for antecedent DPA biosynthesis. Mt-PrsA displays clear homotropic \ncooperativity for ATP, with an apparent S0.5 62.65 \u00b5M, which is extremely low \nconsidering the intracellular concentration of ATP is considered to be between 3 \u2013 5 mM. \nThe homology model generated for Mt-PrsA contains many structural features of other \npRpp synthetases that have been solved to date. The majority of the active site residues \nmodelled in Mt-PrsA are conserved with those from other Mt-PrsA homologues, and it \nappears that the appropriate configuration of amino acid side chains compares well with \nthe B. subtilus structure. This is also the case for the regulatory site in which ADP binds \nto allosterically modulate the enzyme. However, an interesting observation is the \npresence of His109 in the flexible loop region of Mt-PrsA, a residue exclusively \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n22 \nconserved within members of the Corynebacterineae. Considering the close proximity of \nHis109 to both the catalytic and regulatory sites of Mt-PrsA, and its potential to make \ndirect contacts with both ATP and ADP ligands, the presence of this conserved His in the \nflexible region of mycobacterial pRpp synthetases might provide some explanation for \nthe relatively high Kcat. pRpp synthetase superactivity is observed in human type-1 \nN114S mutants (Becker, et al., 1995). This is increase in activity is a result of the loss of \na salt bridge formed between two monomers which induces small but significant changes \nto the catalytic and regulatory site of the enzyme (Liu et al., 2009). Interestingly, the \nhomology model of Mt-PrsA suggests that a slat bridge between the equivalent residues \ndoes not occur thus reducing the stability of the dimer interface. In mycobacteria, the \nbiosynthesis of pRpp is required at a rate which is sufficient to not only supply central \nmetabolic processes, such as de novo nucleoside biosynthesis, but also at a necessary \nlevel to meet the increased demands for pRpp during cell wall biosynthesis (Scherman et \nal., 1995; Scherman et al., 1996). It seems plausible that pRpp synthetases from \nCorynebacterineae species have evolved a highly efficient version of the enzyme to \naccount for the increased metabolic flux of pRpp, during various physiological states. \npRpp synthetases in other organisms undergo stringent control by virtue of allosteric \nmodulation from ADP. In this regard, Mt-PrsA also appears to be no different, displaying \nclear inhibition of enzyme activity between 0.5 - 2.0 mM ADP. When taken together, the \ndata relating to ADP inhibition and the subsequent complex formation with Mt-PrsA, \nsuggests that the mechanism employed for allosteric regulation of Mt-PrsA by ADP, is \nthrough the formation of a Mt-PrsA hexamer (Arnvig et al., 1990). This net increase in \nMt-PrsA hexamer oligimerisation suggests that the efficacy of ATP for its Mt-PrsA \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n23 \ncatalytic site decreases, as a consequence of ADP allosteric modulation. The three human \nPrsA isoforms share a very high sequence identity (91 - 95 % between all three), however \nthe subtle differences that do occur appear in regions of the enzyme which are important \nfor catalysis and allosteric regulation. Inhibition studies using two \naminopyrimidopyrimidine nucleotide analogues 4-methoxy-8-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylamino)-\npyrimido-[5,4-d]-pyrimidine (MRPP) and 4-amino-8-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylamino)-\npyrimido-[5,4-d]-pyrimidine (ARPP) show differential levels of inhibition of human \npRpp synthetases (Fry et al., 1995). Carbocyclic analogues of ribose-5-phosphate are \nanother class of compounds which show differential inhibition when tested against \nSalmonella typhimurium, B. subtilis and human pRpp synthetases (Parry et al., 1996). In \nthis regard, the development of a similar library of compounds targeted for the specific \ninhibition of Mt-PrsA might warrant further investigation. Understanding metabolic \npathways that are essential for persistent TB infections, such as mycobacterial energy \nmetabolism, in combination with pathways involved in cell wall assembly seems a \nplausible strategy for the development of new anti-mycobacterial drugs. \n \nMaterials and Methods \nBacterial strains cloning procedures \nEscherichia coli Top 10 cells (Invitrogen) were used to propagate plasmids during all \ncloning experiments and the over-expression of Mt-PrsA was carried out in E. coli C41 \n(DE3) (Lucigen). Phusion DNA polymerase was purchased from New England Biolabs \nand all restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from fermentas. \nOligonucleotides were purchased from eurofins-MWG and PCR fragments were purified \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n24 \nusing QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Plasmids were purified using the Qiaprep \npurification kit (Qiagen). \n \nGeneration of C. glutamicum prsA-null mutant \nFor the genomic disruption of NCgl0945 (Cg-prsA), we constructed the plasmid \npK18mob-Cg-prsA-int, using the primer pair pNCgl0945_intfor \n(GCGAGCCAATTTCTGCTCGC) and pNCgl0945_intrev \n(GACAACCTGGTTTGCTACCTC) to amplify C. glutamicum WT chromosomal DNA. \nThe resulting DNA fragment was treated with AvaI\/KpnI, and ligated into the non-\nreplicative vector pK18mob (Schafer et al., 1994), which was similarly treated with \nAvaI\/KpnI. The DNA integrity of the resulting construct pK18mob-Cg-prsA-int was \nconfirmed by sequencing and used for transformation of C. glutamicum by \nelectroporation and selected for resistance to kanamycin at 25 \u00b5g\/ml on BHIS medium. \n \n \n \nConstruction of Mt-PrsA expression vector \nThe 981-bp coding region for Mt-PrsA (annotated as Rv1017c) in the M. tuberculosis \nH37Rv genome was amplified by PCR using the following primer pairs (restriction sites \nunderlined) GATCGATCGCTAGCTTGAGCCACGACTGGACCGATAATCGC \n(forward) and GATCGATCCTCGAGTGCGTCCCCGTCGAAAAGTCCTGTTAC \n(reverse). This DNA fragment was restricted with the appropriate enzymes (NheI and \nXhoI) and ligated into pET23b digested with identical enzymes, thus yielding pET23b-\n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n25 \nMt-prsA, which encodes for an C-terminal His6-tagged protein. DNA sequencing and \nconstruct verification was carried out at the University of Birmingham School of \nBioscience Genomics Facility. \n \nExpression and Purification of Mt-PrsA \nE. coli C41 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET23b-Mt-prsA and selected on LB agar \nsupplemented with 100 \u00b5g\/mL amplicillin. Recombinant E. coli cells harbouring \npET23b-Mt-prsA were used to inoculate an overnight of 5mL LB supplemented with 100 \n\u00b5g\/mL amplicillin. This overnight was then used to inoculate 2 x 1 L LB medium \nsupplemented with 100 \u00b5g\/mL amplicillin and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking until A600 \nreached 0.5. IPTG was then added at a final concentration of 1 mM and growth continued \nfor an additional 12 h at 16 \u00b0C with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at \n6000g for 15 mins and washed with 20 mL phosphate buffered saline. Pellets were then \nfrozen until further use. For purification, one pellet was thawed and re-suspended into 50 \nmM KH2PO4 (pH 7.9), 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, one complete protease inhibitor \ncocktail tablet (Roche) and DNAse and RNAse both at a final concentration of 50 \u00b5g\/mL. \nThe cell suspension was disrupted by sonication at a pulse rate of 30 sec ON and 30 sec \nOFF for a total of 10 cycles.

The supernatant was collected and passed over a 5 mL HiTrap Ni2+-\nNTA agarose column (GE Healthcare), which was previously equilibrated with into 50 \nmM KH2PO4 (pH 7.9), 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole. Elution occurred via a \nstepwise gradient of 50 \u2013 500 mM imidazole in 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.9), 300 mM NaCl \nand 10 mL fractions were collected.

The 250 \nmM imidazole fractions of Mt-PrsA was first dialysed against 2 L KH2PO4 (pH 7.9), 150 \nmM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT at 4 \u00b0C and then against 2 L KH2PO4 (pH 7.9), \n150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 10 % glycerol. After dialysis, the protein concentration \nwas determined using the bicinchoninic acid procedure (Pierce) and bovine serum \nalbumin as a standard. \n \nPreparation of [14C]-U-D-ribose-5-phosphate \nWe prepared a source of [14C]-U-D-ribose-5-phosphate ([14C]-R5P) using a modified \nprocess as described in (Boss et al., 1984),for the subsequent use in Mt-PrsA assays. 100 \n\u00b5Ci of [14C]-U-D-glucose (100 \u00b5l in 70 % ethanol) (ARC radiochemicals) was dried in \n14 ml glass tube under compressed nitrogen and then resuspended in 500 \u00b5l of 50 mM \nKH2PO4 (pH 7.9), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 mM MnCl2. 20 \u00b5l of ATP (100 \nmM stock) and 20 \u00b5l of NADP (100 mM stock) was added to the suspension. 20 \u00b5l of \nhexokinase\/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme mix (Roche) was added and \nincubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 mins. A few grains of 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase \n(Sigma) and a further 20 \u00b5l of NADP (100 mM stock) was added and incubated for 15 \nmins at 37 \u00b0C. A few grains of phosphoribose mutase (Sigma) was added to the reaction \nmix and incubated for a further 15 mins at 37 \u00b0C followed by another addition of 20 \u00b5l \nNADP (100 mM stock) and final incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 15 mins. The reaction mix was \nthen diluted with H2O to a final volume of 3 mL and passed through a 10 kDa MWCO \ncentrifugal filtration device (Millipore). The filtrate (~ 3 mL) was then loaded onto a 3 \nmL LC-SAX anion exchange cartridge (Supelco) pre-equilibrated with H2O. The column \n at University of Birm\ningham\n on February 10, 2011\nglycob.oxfordjournals.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n27 \nwas then washed three times with 3 mL H2O. The column was then washed with a 100-\n1000 mM stepwise gradient of sodium acetate (3 mL fractions of 100 mM increments). \nEach fraction (1 \u00b5l) was applied to a glass-backed PEI-cellulose TLC plate and \ndeveloped in 0.85 M KH2PO4 (pH 3.4). After drying, the TLC plate was exposed \novernight to a Kodak autoradiography film for visualisation of radioactive phospho-\nsugars. [14C]-R5P eluted as a single band (as compared to known standards) in the 200 \nmM sodium acetate fraction with a specific activity of 33333 cpm\/\u00b5l.  \n \nRadiochemical assay of Mt-PrsA activity \nThe enzymatic activity of Mt-PrsA was determined by monitoring the transfer of PPi \nfrom ATP to the C1-OH group of enzymaticaaly synthesised [14C]-R5P forming \np[14C]Rpp and AMP. The basic reaction mix contained 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 150 \nmM NaCl, 1mM DTT, 10 % glycerol, varying amounts of [14C]-D-R5P [stored in 200 \nmM sodium acetate, (33333 cpm\/\u00b5l)], 2 mM ATP and 30 \u00b5g Mt-PrsA (15 \u00b5l) in a final \nvolume of 100 \u00b5l. On occasions, MgCl2, MnCl2, CaCl2, ADP and EDTA were included \nin the reaction mix either separately or combination, all at a final concentration of 2 mM. \nReactions were initiated by the addition of Mt-PrsA and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 mins. \nReactions were quenched by the addition of 10 \u00b5l 0.4 M formic acid. The mixture (1.1 \n\u00b5l) was applied to a glass-backed PEI-cellulose TLC plate and developed in 0.85 M \nKH2PO4 (pH 3.4). After drying, the plate was inspected for radioactive spots by either \nexposure to a Kodak film followed by autoradiography or a PhosphorImager (Molecular \nDynamics).

In individual assays, the Ara2 acceptor 8 \u00b5l (stored in CHCl3\/CH3OH, 2:1, v\/v \nat 20 mM) and 50 \u00b5g of decaprenol-1-monophosphate (Larodan Lipids, Malmo, \nSweeden) (5 mg\/ml stored in CHCl3\/CH3OH (2:1, v\/v)) was aliquoted into 1.5 ml \neppendorf tubes and dried under nitrogen. The AraT assay was carried out as described \npreviously (Lee et al., 1997; Seidel et al., 2007) with modifications. IgePalTM (Sigma-\nAldrich) was added (0.1%, v\/v) with the appropriate amount of buffer A (final volume \n100 \u00b5l).

The column was washed with 2 ml \nCH3CH2OH and the eluate collected, dried and partitioned between the two phases \narising from a mixture of n-butanol (3 ml) and water (3 ml). The resulting organic phase \nwas recovered following centrifugation at 3,500g and the aqueous phase again extracted \ntwice with 3 ml of water-saturated n-butanol.

The extracted radiolabeled material was quantified by \nliquid scintillation counting using 10 % of the labelled material and 5 ml of EcoScintA \n(National Diagnostics, Atlanta). The incorporation of [14C]-Araf into Ara2 was \ndetermined by subtracting counts present in control assays (incubations in the absence of \nacceptor).

This perpetual enzyme couple \nimmediately replenishes the pool of ATP and results in a stoichiometry of  1 mole of \nNADH oxidised by lactate dehydrogenase for every 2 moles of AMP produced by Mt-\nPrsA.
