This is recognized as the problem of curve registration. While\nthe registration step is routinely employed, this is considered as a preprocessing step\nprior to any serious analysis. Consequently, the effect of alignment is mostly ignored in\nsubsequent analyses and is not well understood. We revisit the issue by particularly fo-\ncusing on the effect of time variability on the FPCA and illustrate the phenomena from\na borrowed perturbation viewpoint. The analysis further suggests an iterative estimating\nprocedure to optimise FPCA.\nIntroduction\nRepeated measurements in the form of curves are increasingly common in various\nscientific applications including biomedicine and physical sciences (Ramsay and Silver-\nman, 2002, 2005). Individual measurements are taken at consecutive time points (index\nset) and repeatedly observed for different subjects. Usually the sample of curves is as-\nsumed to have some homogeneous structure in the functional shape, while allowed for\nindividual variability. It is desirable that the additional variability is summarised with a\nfew components which are able to extract most variability and which are easy to interpret\n(Park et al. 2007).\nFunctional PCA utilises the well-known Karhunen-Loe`ve expansion to provide an\noptimal representation of the function with a small number of common components. This\nis based on the assumption that the underlying random function shares the common mean\nand covariance function. To fix the idea, consider a stochastic process X \u2208 L2(T ) with\ncompact support T = [0, T ], with the mean function \u00b5(t) and the covariance function\n\u03b3(s, t) = Cov(X(s), X(t)). Assume that\n\u222b\nT E[X(t)\n2] < \u221e. Let \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 \u2265 . . . be the\nordered eigenvalues of the covariance operator defined through \u03b3 with the corresponding\neigenfunctions \u03c61, \u03c62, . . .. We assume that\n\u2211\nk \u03bbk <\u221e. Then\nX(t) = \u00b5(t) +\n\u2211\nk\n\u03bek\u03c6k(t) , (1)\nwhere E[\u03be] = 0 and E[\u03bej\u03bek] = \u03bbjI(j = k).\nWith a sample of curves available, these quantities are replaced by their estimates\nand a finite number of components are usually considered sufficient to extract significant\nobserved variation. Theoretical properties of estimators are studied in Dauxois et al.\n(1982), Rice and Silverman (1991), Kneip (1994) and Hall et al. (2006).\nOften functional data exhibits additional time variability, which is mainly dealt with\nin pre-processing step, by aligning curves to eliminate the time variability prior to any\nserious analysis. This is known as registration problem and there are several methods de-\nveloped. Basically when the functions exhibit identifiable features, curves can be aligned\nto match those features, which is known as landmark registration (Gasser and Kneip,\n1995). This works well as long as features are correctly identified. Several other methods\nhave been developed to automate the procedure when the features are less prominent.\nAn overview can be found in Ramsay and Silverman (2005).\nAlthough the issue has been rightly acknowledged, because most analysis treats regis-\ntration as a preprocessing step, its carry-on effects on later analysis was not well studied.\nA recent work of Kneip and Ramsay (2007) address a similar problem and propose a new\nprocedure to combine registration to fit functional PCA models, extending the covex\naveraging idea of registration (Liu and Mu\u00a8ller, 2004).\nInstead we focus on quantifying our misconduct. What happens then if registration\nwas not carried out or was made improperly ? The obvious problem arises when estima-\nting global mean structure. Generally, how does the time variability propagate through\nto functional PCA analysis ? Some issues with interpretability in functioanl PCA may\nalso be attributed to the improper registration. We concentrate on relations of eigenva-\nlues and eigenfunctions between unregistered and registered curves, in the sense that we\ndo not want our registrations step to be perfect but we would like to be able to correct\nthe residual difference from our imperfect analysis later.\nAssume that the observed variable is X\u02dc(t) = X(\u03b7(t)) for a monotone transformation\n\u03b7(t) with E[\u03b7(t)] = t for t \u2208 T . Suppose that we proceed to functional PCA without\ncorrecting \u03b7 at the earlier stage to obtain \u03bb\u02dc and \u03c6\u02dc. How much do we lose by ignoring \u03b7 ?\nWe may start with the representation in (1) as\nX\u02dc(t) = \u00b5(\u03b7(t)) +\n\u2211\nk\n\u03bek\u03c6k(\u03b7(t)) .\nNow E[X\u02dc(t)] = \u00b5(\u03b7(t)) but note that the series is not any longer orthonormal decompo-\nsition. Write \u03b3\u02dc(s, t) = Cov(X\u02dc(s), X\u02dc(t)). Then\n\u03b3\u02dc(s, t) = \u03b3(s, t) + \u03b3\u02dc(s, t)\u2212 \u03b3(s, t) .\nWith some Taylor appromixation argument, it may be shown that \u03b3\u02dc(s, t) \u2212 \u03b3(s, t) =\n\u03b5v(s, t) for some \u03b5 and v, then, under some regularity conditions and for small \u03b5, we\nwould have\n\u03bb\u02dck = \u03bbk + \u03b5 < \u03c6k, V \u03c6 > +O(\u03b52) ,\n\u03c6\u02dck \u221d \u03c6+ \u03b5\n\u2211\nl 6=k\n< \u03c6k, V \u03c6l >\n\u03bbk \u2212 \u03bbl +O(\u03b5\n2) ,\nwhere V denotes the corresponding operator for v. A similar derivation is made in Hall et\nal. (2006) to quantify sampling variability. We extend the idea to include time variability.\nOur interest is to recover \u03bb and \u03c6 from \u03bb\u02dc and \u03c6\u02dc using a sample of curves and a registration.\nOur estimators will be obtained from the estimators of unregistered curves with some\ncorrection made based on a registration. The precision of registration will be reflected\non that of V and thus the correction terms in general. Based on these relations some\nproperties of estimators will be studied and illustrated.\nReferences\nDauxois, J. Pousse, A. and Romain, Y.
