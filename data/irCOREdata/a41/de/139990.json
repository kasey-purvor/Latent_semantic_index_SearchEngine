Introduction \nEpoxy resins, used as binder for industrial coatings, have become increasingly important [1] \nrepresenting perhaps the best combination of mechanical properties and corrosion \nresistance [2, 3], thus providing outstanding service under severe conditions [1, 2].  \nDemands for coatings with superior technical characteristics have induced the use of composite \ncoatings, which usually represent an extremely strong product. Glass, polyaramide or graphite \nfibres or flakes are employed to offer additional strength and improved abrasion resistance [1, 4, \n5]. Glass flake-reinforced coatings are able to combat many of the most severe corrosive \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \nenvironments, possessing low permeability for water and corrosive species and low conductivity \n[6]. Composites with graphite fibres form a durable protective coating, though it is known [7] \nthat when coupled to ordinary metals, in the presence of moisture, they promote galvanic \ncorrosion of any metal less noble than platinum. \nHighly conductive particulate polymer composites have recently found numerous important \nindustrial applications [8], e.g. for EM1 shields [8, 9], radar absorbing materials [7], static \ndissipative plastics [8, l0], heating devices [8] and conductive coatings [11], as they exhibit \nincreased thermal and mechanical properties and contribute to structural, optical and electrical \nneeds [ 7, 12, 13] . \nData concerning the protective action of particulate polymeric coatings justify the excellent \nbarrier protection that zinc-rich coatings offer [14-16] and demonstrate that composites with \nmetal fillers (Fe, Al, Zn) exhibit similar [17] or slightly lower [18] protective properties than that \nof pure epoxy coatings.  \nConductive fillers can greatly alter conductivity and dielectric characteristics of the polymeric \nmatrix in which they are dispersed [19], affecting significantly the diffusion of \nwater to the metal-coating interface and consequently the appearance of galvanic interactions. \nWater in a coating is the necessary factor for the start of the corrosion process [20], which is \nmainly blistering [21] also resulting in loss of adhesion and deterioration of the mechanical \nproperties [22]. \nThe transport path which determines the conductivity in such conductive polymeric composites \nundergoes an insulator- conductor transition which depends on the particles\u2019 concentration [ 8, \n23]. The threshold value of particles\u2019 volume concentration at which these systems become \nconducting varies in the different systems, e.g. 8% for carbon black in Araldite D [23], 37% for \nAg particles in Bakelite powder [24], 5-6% in systems obtained by compaction of polyethylene \npowders with Ni or polyvinyl-chloride with Cu [25, 26], about 40% for epoxy resin randomly \nloaded with Cu, Ag, Al, Sn or Pb [27] or around 20% according to other researchers [28]. \nComplex conductivity and dielectric permittivity as a function of composition and constituents\u2019 \nproperties can be calculated using mixing laws [29, 30] and effective medium theories [31]. \nThe aim of this work is to study the effect of concentration of metal particles on the corrosion \nperformance of steel specimens coated with metal filled particulate composites when exposed to \nsaline environment. A commercially available epoxy resin and iron powder were used to prepare \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \ncomposites with concentration of iron, 7.5,15 and 30% wt.\/wt. Corrosion potential, corrosion \ncurrent density (Tafel), a.c. impedance \nand dielectric measurements were performed. \n \n2. Experimental \nThe test specimens were circular steel disks (diameter \u03a6= 6 cm) with a composition (in wt.%) of \nC, 0.12; Mn, 0.5; P, 0.005; S, 0.05 and balance Fe. The coating used was a commercially \navailable bisphenol A-type epoxy resin (DER 321, Dow Chemical Co.) with epoxide equivalent \nweight 182-192, viscosity 500-700 mPa s at 25 \u201cC and density 1.14 g ml-\u2019 at 25 \u201cC. As curing \nagent, a cycloaliphatic amine (product XZ 87706.05, Dow Chemical Co.), was used. The ratio \nresin\/curing agent was the stoichiometric according to the manufacturers\u2019 data sheets. The system \nwas used either in this formulation or filled with powdered metal in a content of 7.5, 15 or 30% \nby weight. Powdered metal was incorporated in the liquid state at 30 \u03bfC. Metal powder of iron \n(Ferak Lab.) of 40 pm grain size was used. The corrosion environment was prepared by \ndissolving analytical grade NaCl in deionized water to give 3.5 wt.%. \nThe metallic substrate was cleaned by immersion in a strong solution of HCl with an organic \ncorrosion inhibitor, washed with water, polished with emery paper up to 1000 grit, degreased for \n10 min in boiling xylene and stored in a desiccator, containing silica gel, before coating to avoid \nany influence of moisture. Each mixture after being stirred thoroughly was deposited on the metal \nsurface by a spinning coater (Erichsen 334\/E). Initial curing was carried out at ambient for 24 h, \nfollowed by postcuring at 40 \u03bfC for 48 h, to assure a stable situation at room temperature. Then \nthe specimens were immersed in the corrosive environment, i.e. in 3.5% NaCl solution. \nSpecimens coated only with epoxy \nresin were used as reference specimens. \nEach type of measurement at every exposure time tested was performed on different specimens \nand was always duplicated. Specimens having a dry film thickness at each surface equal to 70\u00b15 \n\u00b5m were chosen from a greater production number. \nThe electrochemical cell for both EIS and Tafel measurements consisted of a hollow Teflon\u00ae \ncylinder or pipe clamped to the surface of the metal substrate and creating by an Oring seal the \nvessel for the electrolyte (3.5% NaCl). The working electrode was the coated specimen, having \nan exposed surface area equal to 19.63 cm2. The reference electrode was a saturated calomel \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \nelectrode (SCE), while the auxiliary electrode was a high density graphite rod. All measurements \nwere carried out at ambient with the electrolyte in contact with air. Before each measurement, the \ncoated steel electrode was kept at open circuit and the change of the potential was recorded until \nits stabilization at a value referred to as the corrosion potential, corrE . Potentiodynamic scans \nwere performed, one for the anodic and one for the cathodic polarization, using a Princeton \nApplied Research model 33 potentiostat\/galvanostat. Both anodic and cathodic potentiodynamic \nscans were run at 1 mV s-1. \nTime dependence of the rest potential of each type of specimen referring to a SCE was \nmonitored. \nThe EIS measurements were performed by applying a small-amplitude perturbation of 15 mV in \na sine wave form by means of a Video bridge T-2100 of Electra-Scientific Industries Inc., in the \nfrequency range 20 Hz-5 KHz and by an impedance analyser LF4192A of Hewlett Packard, in \nthe frequency range 5 KHz-l 3 MHz. The modulus of impedance and the phase shift were \nobtained. Each value was the mean value of five measurements in a logarithmic sweep of the \nfrequencies (20 points per logarithmic unit). Curve fitting of the EIS data was performed by \nZSIM software using a non-linear least-squares fitting method (NLLSF) . Dielectric \nmeasurements were performed in a three terminal guarded system, constructed according to \nASTM D150-92. At predetermined immersion times, coated specimens were taken out of the \ncorrosive environment, washed with acetone, dried in air and were put in the three terminal \ndielectric cell, so that they formed the dielectric element of the capacitor. Capacitance values and \nthe loss factor (D) of the coating were measured in the frequency range 20 Hz-13 MHz using the \nabove-mentioned bridges. From these measurements the dielectric permittivity and dielectric \nlosses were calculated [32]. \n \n3. Results and discussion \nThe corrosion tendency of the steel substrate was estimated for each type of coated specimen by \nthe half-cell potential development versus the exposure time to the corrosive environment. Plots \nof this evaluation referred to a saturated calomel electrode are given in Fig. 1, for specimens \ncoated with epoxy resin or with composites of epoxy resin and iron powder together with that of \nan uncoated sample used as a reference.  \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \nImmediately after immersion in 3.5% NaCl the uncoated specimens exhibit potential values close \nto - 670 mV and after 4 h of immersion the potential value of these specimens appears to acquire \na constant value of about - 700 mV which remains stable during the whole immersion period. \nAt the beginning of the exposure, specimens coated with epoxy resin containing iron powder \nhave a potential value close to that of the specimens coated with pure epoxy resin \nirrespective of the concentration of iron particles. This value is always less electronegative than \nthat of the uncoated specimens. Thereafter a decay to more negative potential values was \nobserved during the first seven days for specimens with coatings containing iron followed by a \nmore or less steady state value of about - 600 mV. The potential decay for specimens with pure \nepoxy coating lasted about 60 days and afterwards a tendency to stabilization was evident at \nabout the same potential region of - 610 mV. The corrosion potential provides a qualitative clue \nwhether a given structure is in an active or a passive state. In all cases the trend to reach stable \nvalues, which differ less than 100 mV from that of the free corrosion potential of uncoated steel, \nimplies an increasing electrochemical activity of the metal surface during the test. \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Time dependence of corrosion potential for different types of coated and uncoated steel \nspecimens: , bare steel; , pure epoxy; , 7.5%; , 15%; , 30% wt.\/wt. iron powder. \n \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \nHowever, the evolution of the similar free corrosion potential and small differences in the \ncorrosion potential plateau values irrespective of iron powder concentration do not allow a \nqualitative prediction of corrosion performance.  \nThe results of anodic and cathodic polarization tests are given in Figs. 2 and 3 for specimens \ncoated with pure epoxy resin or with epoxy resin in combination with iron powder at the \nbeginning and after ninety days of immersion. Each plot is composed of a separate anodic and \ncathodic scan. \n \nFig. 2. Potentiodynamic polarization plots of different types of coated steel specimens exposed to \n3.5% NaCl solution for 4 h:  , pure epoxy; , 7.5%; ,15%; , 30% wt.\/wt. iron powder. \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \n \nFig. 3. Potentiodynamic polarization plots for different types of coated steel specimens exposed \nto 3.5% NaCl solution for 90 days:  , pure epoxy; , 7.5%; ,15%; , 30% wt.\/wt. iron \npowder. \n \nThese figures show that the corrosion potential of all tested samples has roughly the same value, \nan observation which is in agreement with the results of the time dependence of the corrosion \npotential. \nFig. 2 demonstrates that at the beginning of the exposure, the corrosion current density for all \nspecimens coated with particulate composites is lower than that of specimens coated with pure \nepoxy resin. \nThe dispersion of conductive particles in an epoxy matrix changes the transport properties of the \ncoating because it leads to a decrease of the coating resistance and to an easy creation of \nconductive paths affecting negatively the protective properties of the coating. However, at the \nsame time, the metal powder grains, by filling the micropores of the polymeric matrix, exert a \nbarrier effect which positively affects the protective properties of the coating. Consequently \nspecimens with coating containing iron powder show improved corrosion behaviour. \nCoatings with the lowest iron powder content (7.5% wt.1 wt.) show a clearer improvement than \ncoatings with higher iron powder content (15, 30% wt.\/wt.), the corrosion performance of which \nis close to that of the pure epoxy resin. This behaviour is probably the result of a counterbalance \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \nbetween the barrier effect exerted by the composite coatings and a possible unsatisfactory wetting \nof the metal particles by the resin and\/or a lower resistance of resin\/metal particles adhesion to \nwet conditions, with increasing metal powder concentration. \nIt is known [33,34] that in the case of conventional pigments in a coating, if water can \naccumulate at the pigment\/binder interface, or porous particles can be formed, the permeability of \nthe coating increases with the pigment volumeconcentration. This statement can be extended for \nthe case of metal powders when used instead of conventional pigments. \nAfter 90 days of exposure to the corrosive environment the corrosion performance of coatings \ncontaining iron powder remains close to that of pure epoxy coatings but the slope of the curves \n( dEdi \/ ) in the former case is slightly steeper. \nVisual examination of the specimens reveals in the early phase of exposure, i.e. at around 15 \ndays, the appearance of green coloured spots which develop to greater black regions with \nincreasing exposure time. The initially appearing spots are attributed to the precipitation of green \ncomplexes formed in a chloride environment as intermediate in the formation of oxyhydroxides \nor iron oxides [35]. Iron oxides probably compose the black products possessing a high \nadherence to the metal surface [36]. The bulky corrosion products can establish a barrier effect \nand consequently can counterbalance the increase in permeability due to the presence of iron \nparticles. \nThe formation of corrosion products in a chloride environment can also deteriorate the protective \nproperties because chloride ions can destroy the oxide layer causing pitting corrosion [37]. The \nvisual examination of the bare steel surface during experiments has not revealed any pitting of the \nsurface. \nThe minor differences in the performance between the composite coatings tested and the pure \nepoxy resin coatings strengthen the assumption that the iron concentration levels used in these \ncoatings are lower than the percolation threshold and thus the systems have not yet become \npurely conductive[8, 23]. \nThe a.c. impedance response of the steel specimens with composite coatings is dependent on \nimmersion time in the sodium chloride environment. Bode plots taken after 4 h of immersion and \n90 days of immersion are displayed in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. At the frequency range of the \nperformed measurements, 20 Hz-13 MHz, normally only the response of the organic coating is \nobserved while the response of the corroded substrate is observed in a lower frequency range ( \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \n10-3-10 Hz). At the beginning of corrosion this range can be extended and the breakpoint \nfrequency can be shifted from 10-3 to 104-5 or more Hz [38] but this behaviour cannot be related to \nany of the specimens tested. \nAt early exposure times two capacitive responses and consequently two maximum phase shifts \nare displayed for composite coatings. This implies that in this case two time constants exist [39], \nrepresenting two rate-determining steps of the electrochemical process, one at high frequencies \nwhich is generally attributed to the film and the other at middle frequencies to the presence of \niron powder. Coatings of pure epoxy resin show one time constant. \nThe time dependence of the impedance values (Fig. 6) demonstrates that the coating behaviour \npasses through a transition state at early immersion times, indicating the change in the properties \nof the coating, to a steady state in which the impedance values of pure epoxy resin coatings and \ncomposite coatings range between 0.4 and 0.7\u00d7106 \u2126 cm2. \n \n \n \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \n \nFig. 4.

The bulk characteristics of the coating are described by the coating \nresistance fR and coating geometrical capacitance fC .

The \npart of the circuit in Fig. 7(b) which generally represents the corrosion process \nof the metal substrate was suggested here to express the corrosion process of the iron filler at \nearly immersion times. \nIf the two time constants of this system are expressed as \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \nfff CR=\u03c4  and mcmcmc CR=\u03c4  \nwhere mcR and mcC refer to the charge transfer resistance and capacitance of the metal powder \ncorrosion process, the time constant at higher frequencies may be attributed to the coating if \nmcf \u03c4\u03c4 \u2264  [ 43], which is true in this case. \n \n \nFig. 6. Impedance time dependence for different types of coated steel specimens:  , pure epoxy; \n, 7.5%; ,15%; , 30% wt.\/wt. iron powder. \n \nFig. 7. Electrical equivalent circuit generally accepted for a coated metal\/solution interface \nwithout diffusion: (a) barrier coatings; (b) non-barrier coating. \n \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \nThe results show that the equivalent circuit in Fig. 7(b) and in Fig. 7 (a) represent fairly well the \nelectrochemical situation of the composite coatings at early and long immersion \ntimes, respectively. \nIn the region of medium frequencies (~102.5-104.5 Hz), the time constant is indicative of the \noxidation of the metallic grains used as filler, while at high frequencies ( > 105 Hz) the time \nconstant is attributed to the capacitive behaviour of the polymeric film. The absence of a medium \nfrequency time constant in responses at long immersion times, can be associated with the \nevolution of corrosion products throughout the film which modifies the characteristics of the \ncoating. \nAt a high frequency range, resistance exhibits values of about and 1.1\u00d7106 \u2126 cm2. This high \nvalue cannot simply represent the electrolyte solution resistance, the value of which is only about \n20 \u2126 cm2Similar results have been attributed to a contact resistance which imposes a hindrance to \nmovement of ions between electrolyte and coatings [44]. \nIn Fig. 8 the time dependence of the resistance of the composite coatings is reported. In the initial \nperiod a sharp reduction of the coating resistance is clearly observed indicating \nincreasing conductivity in the coating and consequently lower protective properties. These results \nsuggest that the penetration of the coating by the electrolyte solution increases rapidly at early \nimmersion times. Thereafter the reduction of the coating resistance slows down and finally at \nlong exposure times a tendency to reach a constant resistance value is evidenced. At the time \nwhen a steady state condition is attained, total penetration of the coating by the electrolyte \nsolution occurs which is followed by loss of protection [ 45]. \nThese results reveal that composite coatings with iron concentration up to 30% behave almost the \nsame as those with pure epoxy resin. \nThe time evolution of the coating capacitance (Fig. 9) is in accordance with the above results. At \nearly stages of exposure the sharp rise in the capacitance values suggests a rapid water \npenetration followed by a rather low increase of water diffusion. However, the only information \nthat can be derived concerns the total water in the system, which is higher in the case of \ncomposite coatings, and not the amount of aqueous phase water at the metal-coating interface \nwhich is the medium where the corrosion of the substrate occurs. \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \n \nFig. 8.

Dielectric permittivity vs. frequency for different types of coated steel specimens after \none day of immersion:  , pure epoxy; ,15%; , 30% wt.\/wt. iron powder. \nThe dielectric response of the coatings can also be related to their corrosion behaviour. Fig. 10 \nshows the dielectric permittivity versus frequency, of the coatings containing various amounts of \niron powder, after one day of immersion in the corrosive environment. \nAs expected dielectric permittivity is higher for the coatings containing iron powder than for \nthose with pure epoxy resin. Dielectric permittivity also increases with the amount \nof iron powder in the coatings. In the low frequency range dielectric permittivity shows \nhigh values which are diminished as the frequency is increased, a behaviour which can be \nattributed to the interfacial polarization effect. This phenomenon appears in heterogeneous media \nconsisting of phases with different dielectric permittivities and conductivities and is due to the \naccumulation of charges at the interfaces [ 46-48]. \nThere are many causes for heterogeneity in materials but those concerning the coatings used in \nthe present work relate to interfaces created by particles dispersed in the insulating matrix, by \npenetrating water and the corrosion products created in the coating. \nWhen an electric field acts on materials it may induce polarization provided that there are charges \nor dipoles which are capable of being spatially redistributed under the field. For dipolar \npolarization charge redistribution depends on dipolar re-orientation whilst for electronic and \natomic polarizations charge displacements occur at optical frequencies. Interfacial polarization, \nhowever, can involve several alternatives, including migration of charges through the bulk of the \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \nmaterials, surface conductance or transport within any double layer. It can thus achieve large \nmagnitudes (reflected in high permittivity) because of the large distances, in terms of molecular \nscale, that carriers can be displaced. Even a very small number of carriers can provide large \ninduced dipoles across the regions of heterogeneity. \nAs the frequency of the acting electric field is increasing, orientation of the large dipoles becomes \nmore difficult and consequently the dielectric permittivity is decreased. \nAfter 60 days of immersion the situation has become more complicated (Fig. 11). The water \nuptake leads to the transformation of the surface of the metal particles and the creation of \ncorrosion products. Values of dielectric permittivity are higher than the values after one day of \nimmersion, mainly because of the higher content of water in the composite coatings. The coatings \nwith 7.5% wt.\/wt. iron content show higher values of dielectric permittivity than the coatings \nwith 15% or 30% wtlwt. in iron powder. \nIn the coating with the lowest amount of iron particles, the modification of the characteristics of \nthe coating by the oxidation of the metallic grains and the creation of corrosion products is also \nlow and does not significantly influence the permittivity. On the contrary when the amount of \niron particles in the coating is high, corrosion products, which generally have low dielectric \npermittivity, will be present in greater amounts and according to the law of mixtures, the \ndielectric permittivity will be lower for the coatings with higher initial loading in iron particles. \n \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \nFig. 11.

The pure epoxy \ncoating after 1 day of immersion is represented by . \n \nThe dielectric losses versus frequency of the coating with pure epoxy after one day of immersion \nin the corrosive environment and of the coating with 15% wt.\/wt. iron powder \nfor various immersion times are shown in Fig. 12. All coatings show considerable losses in the \nlow and middle range of frequencies as expected because of interfacial polarization. As \nimmersion time increases and water uptake is increased in the coatings dielectric losses increase \nand move to higher frequencies. \nThe high value of the slope in curves at low frequencies reveals the existence of conductive \npathways [49] but since the slope is not substantially altered as immersion timeincreases, the \nconductivity in the coating is not considerably changing, which means that the protective \nbehaviour still exists. Almost the same behaviour was observed for all coatings irrespective of the \nloading in metal powder. Small differences in the values of the dielectric losses of coatings with \ndifferent iron content do not reflect any real change in their behaviour when exposed to a \ncorrosive environment. Almost the same slope of the loss curve representing the losses of the \npure epoxy coating compared with those of coatings containing iron powder also ascertains what \nPublished in Progress in Organic Coatings 28 (1996) 117-124 \n \nwas already found by other measurements: iron in the coating, at least, does not deteriorate the \nprotective properties of the coating. \n \n4. Conclusions \nSteel specimens coated with particulate polymeric coatings composed of epoxy resin and iron \npowder in various concentrations show an increasing electrochemical activity of the metal \nsurface during exposure to 3.5% NaCl solution. This development forwards an active state \nsimilar to that of specimens coated with pure epoxy resin. \nCorrosion rate measurements of the steel substrate reveal minor differences in the anticorrosive \nbehaviour of the composite coatings, irrespective of the iron content in the coating, their action \nbeing always close to that of pure epoxy resin coatings. \nThese results are in good correlation with the corresponding EIS measurements, according to \nwhich the resistance of both the composite and the pure epoxy resin coatings is rapidly \ndiminished at early exposure times but thereafter it shows a tendency to a rather steady state \nsituation, while the coatings\u2019 capacitance first shows a sharp rise followed by a very low increase. \nIt is suggested that the evolution of corrosion products throughout the film modified the \ncharacteristics of the coating exerting a barrier effect, counterbalancing the increase in \nconductivity. The negative effect of the presence of chloride ions on the protective properties of \nthe coating due to the formation of very soluble iron salts (halogenides) which destroy the oxide \nlayer and cause pitting corrosion has not been observed. \nThe dielectric approach to the corrosion behaviour of the coatings reveals also the formation of \ncorrosion products which decrease the dielectric permittivity of the coatings with higher metal \ncontent, at long exposure times. Dielectric losses, reflecting the change in conductivity of the \ncoatings with time and metal loading, signify that these polymeric particulate composite coatings \npresent a similar anticorrosive ebehaviour to the coatings of pure epoxy resin. \n \nReferences \n[1] P.A.
