We undertook a systematic comparison of decisions made \nabout 18 purposively selected applications, each of which was reviewed independently by \nthree different RECs in a single Strategic Health Authority. Decisions about 11 applications \nwere consistent, but there were disparities among RECs on decisions for 7 applications. \nAnalysis of agreement of RECs\u2019 decisions yielded an overall measure of agreement of \u03ba = \n0.286 (95% CI  -0.06 to 0.73), indicating a level of agreement that, while probably better than \nchance, might be described as \u201cslight\u201d.  The small sample size limits the robustness of these \nfindings. Further research is needed into reasons for inconsistencies in decision-making \nbetween RECs, and into the significance of such inconsistencies for a range of arguments. \n 2\nConsistency in Research Ethics Committee decision-making: \na controlled comparison\nResearch Ethics Committees (RECs) in the UK aim to make decisions about research \nproposals in line with published guidance.1 The importance of systematic and consistent \ndecision-making by RECs has been repeatedly emphasised, most recently in the national \nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for RECs, 2 prompted partly by EU legislation.3 Much \nof the evidence about consistency in REC decision-making in the UK is based on studies of a \nsingle proposal being submitted to multiple committees, and is authored by the investigators \nthemselves, usually in response to frustrating experiences. 4 5 6 There is little evidence about \nthe extent to which RECs agree about proposals. We aimed to compare decisions about the \nsame proposals made by different RECs. \nMethods \nThe three RECs in the Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland (LNR) Strategic Health \nAuthority were included in the project, which ran between February 2004 and February 2005. \nMembers of the committees gave their verbal consent to participation in Autumn 2003. \nPurposive sampling was used to select applications for inclusion in the project. Sampling was \nconducted by EA, a REC administrator, and aimed to represent different types of study and \ndifferent types of applicant. Types of study were: \n\u2022 Intervention: a study that intervenes in the normal clinical care of a patient\/health \nservice user. \n\u2022 Non-intervention: a study that does not involve an intervention but seeks to \nmeasure outcomes or processes. \n\u2022 Qualitative: a study that uses distinctive qualitative research methods.  \nTypes of applicant were: \n\u2022 Novice: applicants who had not previously applied to the REC. \n 3\n\u2022 Experienced: applicants who had submitted at least one previous application to the \nREC. \nOver a 12 month period each application was reviewed by all three RECs and all three \nprepared a decision letter. Each application was assigned a \u201clead\u201d REC before the application \nwas considered by any committee, and applicants received the decision letter of the lead \nREC only.  The two non-lead RECs were sent this application as a \u201cdummy\u201d, dispatched as \none of the many applications for each meeting, and not labelled as \u201cthe dummy\u201d (though it \nmight sometimes have been possible for members to guess). Over the course of the project, \neach committee reviewed 12 \u201cdummy\u201d applications and six applications as the \u201clead\u201d \ncommittee. \n Three decision letters for each application were generated for analysis. Under Governance \nArrangements for Research Ethics Committees (GAfREC)1 and SOPs2 guidance, there were \nfour formal decisions available to RECs:  \n\u2022 Favourable: The application is ethically acceptable.   \n\u2022 Provisional: Amendments to the application or further information are required \nbefore a final decision can be made. \n\u2022 Unfavourable: The application is ethically unacceptable.  \n\u2022 Outside remit: The application is deemed to fall outside the remit of GAfREC.  \nPatterns of agreement in decisions were assessed descriptively. Agreement was further \nassessed using the kappa statistic, which indicates the proportion of observed agreement that \ncannot be explained by chance. The one \u201cfavourable\u201d decision was grouped as \u201cprovisional\u201d \nfor purposes of this analysis.  \n \n \n \n 4\n  \nResults \nTable 1 Types of study, types of applicant, and decisions \nNo. Study type Applicant \ntype \nREC1 REC2 REC3 \n1 Non-intervention Novice Provisional Provisional Provisional \n2 Non-intervention Novice Unfavourable Unfavourable Unfavourable \n3 Qualitative Expert Provisional Provisional Provisional \n4 Intervention Expert Provisional Provisional Provisional \n5 Qualitative Novice Provisional Provisional Provisional \n6 Non-intervention Novice Provisional Unfavourable Unfavourable \n7 Intervention Expert Provisional Provisional Unfavourable \n8 Intervention Expert Provisional Provisional Favourable \n9 Intervention Expert Unfavourable Outside remit Provisional \n10 Qualitative Novice Provisional Provisional Unfavourable \n11 Qualitative Novice Provisional Provisional Provisional \n12 Qualitative Novice Provisional Outside remit Provisional \n13 Qualitative Expert Provisional Provisional Unfavourable \n14 Intervention Novice Provisional Provisional Provisional \n15 Non-intervention Novice Provisional Provisional Provisional \n16 Non-intervention Expert Provisional Provisional Provisional \n17 Non-intervention Expert Provisional Provisional Provisional \n18 Qualitative Novice Provisional Provisional Provisional \n \nEleven of the 18 applications received consistent decisions from all three committees (Table \n1).  \u201cProvisional\u201d was the most frequent decision for all three RECs. REC3 had a higher \n 5\nincidence of unfavourable decisions (five, compared with two in REC1 and REC2), but was \nalso the only REC to give a favourable decision.  REC2 was the only one to give \u201coutside \nremit\u201d decisions.  \nOf the seven applications that received inconsistent decisions, six received consistent \ndecisions from two committees. One application received different decisions from all three \ncommittees. Of the six applications where two committees agreed, four received consistent \ndecisions from REC1 and REC2, one received consistent decisions from REC2 and REC3, \nand one received consistent decisions from REC1 and REC3.  All three committees agreed \non seven novice and four expert applications, and all three did not agree on three novice and \nfour expert applications. The committees agreed on five non-intervention, four qualitative and \ntwo intervention studies, but did not agree on one non-intervention, three qualitative, and \nthree intervention studies.   \nAnalysis of agreement of RECs\u2019 decisions yielded an overall measure of agreement of \u03ba = \n0.286 (95% CI  -0.06 to 0.73), indicating a level of agreement that, while probably better than \nchance, might be described as \u201cslight\u201d.   \nDiscussion \nThis study provides evidence about consistency of outcomes of REC decision-making. It was \nlimited by its location within a single SHA. Variations in the types of application submitted over \ntime imposed constrained the extent to which it was possible to select equal proportions of \ndifferent types of study and applicant, though a reasonable balance was achieved. More \nimportantly, the difficulties of conducting this type of research, which necessarily results in \nadditional burdens on RECs, limited the size of the sample that could be obtained. The wide \nconfidence interval demonstrates that there is considerable uncertainty about the point \nestimate, and polarised response categories such as those found in our dataset make the \ninterpretation of the kappa statistic difficult. This inherently low-powered analysis nonetheless \naddresses an important question in an area where it is difficult to obtain data. \n 6\nAlthough 11 of 18 applications considered by three RECs in our project received consistent \ndecisions, seven \u2013 over a third of the sample - received inconsistent decisions. This evidence \nraises the bigger question of the significance of consistency of decision-making for various \narguments.7   There is little doubt that disparities in process and outcome are a source of \nfrustration and delay for researchers. 8 There is also the possibility that, in a context where \nresearch governance is constructed as a regulatory and managerial enterprise, 9  variations in \noutcome will be read as evidence of problems in \u201cperformance\u201d.  Further research is needed \ninto reasons for variations in decision-making, including further analysis of the content of \ndecision letters in our own study. Such research may help to further an understanding of what \nkinds of issues are identified by RECs as being \u201cethical\u201d issues, how they can be resolved, \nand what kinds of ideas and principles appear to inform opinions about ethical issues. This \nkind of research could afford an exploration of whether disparities are due, as previous \nauthors have suggested, to inconsistencies in moral judgements (which might be \nunavoidable, acceptable, or even desirable) or to irrationality, carelessness, or operation of \nconflicting interests (which should be reduced or removed). 10 \n  \nConflict of interest \nEA was employed as the Administrator to the Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland \nResearch Ethics Committees during the period of the study. No other author has a conflict of \ninterest. \nAcknowledgements \nThe idea for this study was conceived following discussions between EA and two committee \nmembers (Dr Douglas Tincello and Dr Carl Edwards).  Dr Jennifer Kurinczuk provided helpful \ncomments on an earlier draft. Professor Paul Burton commented in detail on statistical issues, \nand Dr Sheila Bonas offered useful advice on presentation of data. COREC gave permission \nfor co-ordination of the project to be undertaken during working hours.  The project was \nunfunded, but LNR SHA allowed two days for writing up.   \n 7\n Ethics approval \nSupport was sought and obtained from COREC in summer 2003.  COREC confirmed that the \nproject constituted service evaluation and development and therefore need not be reviewed \nby a Research Ethics Committee. \n \n REFERENCES \n \n \n1.
