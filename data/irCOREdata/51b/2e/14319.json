Dunlap** and Judith A. Duffield*\n*University of Colorado at Denver, USA\n**Regis University, USA\nRich Environments for Active Learning (REALs) are comprehensive instructional systems that are\nconsistent with constructivist theories. They promote study and investigation within authentic contexts;\nencourage the growth of student responsibility, initiative, decision making and intentional learning;\ncultivate collaboration among students and teachers; utilize dynamic, interdisciplinary, generative\nlearning activities that promote higher-order thinking processes to help students develop rich and complex\nknowledge structures; and assess student progress in content and learning-to-learn within authentic\ncontexts using realistic tasks and performances. Problem-Based Learning (PBL) is an instructional\nmethodology that can be used to create REALs. PBL's student-centred approach engages students in a\ncontinuous collaborative process of building and reshaping understanding as a natural consequence of\ntheir experiences and interactions within learning environments that authentically reflect the world\naround them. In this way, PBL and REALs are a response to teacher-centred educational practices that\npromote the development of inert knowledge, such as conventional teacher-to-student knowledge\ndissemination activities. In this article, we compare existing assumptions underlying teacher-directed\neducational practice with new assumptions that promote problem solving and higher-level thinking by\nputting students at the centre of learning activities. We also examine the theoretical foundation that\nsupports these new assumptions and the need for REALs. Finally, we describe each REAL characteristic\nand provide supporting examples of REALs in action using PBL\nIn 1995, ALT-J published an article titled 'Rich Environments for Active Learning: a definition'\n(Grabinger and Dunlap, 1995). This present contribution builds on the concepts discussed in that initial\narticle by using PBL as an example of REALs. Though REALs are defined briefly here, readers are\nencouraged to consult the first article for a more thorough defining discussion.\nChanging educational needs\nLearning and the information explosion\nIn today's complex world of rapid change, of increasing innovation and of proliferating\nknowledge, employers and employees must be able to apply tools and knowledge to new\nsituations with increasing frequency to remain productive and competitive (see Nash, 1994).\nBecause we face an environment in which knowledge and skills become rapidly obsolete,\npeople need to know how to be involved in a continual process of 'retooling' their knowledge\n5\nScott Gro'oinger et al Rich environments for active learning in action: problem-based learning\nand skill base (see Swanson et al, 1993). Consequently, learning to think critically, to analyse\nand synthesize information to solve technical, social, economic, political, and scientific\nproblems, and to engage in lifelong learning, are crucial for successful and fulfilling\nparticipation in our competitive society. Learning environments which prepare learners for the\ncomplexities of the professional world utilize instructional activities reflecting the problem-\nsolving and challenge-meeting process professionals use on their jobs. Learners need to:\n\u2022 determine for themselves what issues need to be addressed when facing a new problem;\n\u2022 identify knowledge and skills they already possess that can be applied to the situation;\n\u2022 determine which skill and knowledge areas are deficient, arid create learning plans to\naddress those deficiencies;\n\u2022 create timelines, manage resources, and monitor their progress;\n\u2022 apply what they know to problems that may change substantially from one moment to\nanother; and\n\u2022 assess their performance and make changes in personal processes for use to meet\nsubsequent challenges.\nThe instructional activities in which learners need to be engaged require them to take personal\nand active roles in all aspects of the knowledge construction and problem-solving processes. A\nlearning environment that places students in the driver's seat of the learning process - involving\nthem in the planning, controlling, and directing of learning activities and the application and\nassessment of learning processes and outcomes - is the essence of a REAL - a Rich\nEnvironment for Active Learning (Grabinger and Dunlap, 1995).

We shall\n6\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 2\nbegin with definitions of REALs and PBL, then move on to a description of the attributes of\nREALs and how PBL uses those attributes.\nRich Environments for Active Learning\nPurpose of REALs\nConventional instruction often utilizes simplified, decontextualized examples and problems\n(Collins et al, 1991) leading to an inadequate understanding of and ability to apply the\nunderstandings developed. Bransford etal (1990) state that 'the basic problem is that traditional\ninstruction often fails to produce the kinds of transfer to new problem-solving situations that\nmost educators would like to see'. Because the information presented to students has no\nrelevance or meaning for them, they tend to treat new information as facts to be memorized and\nrecited rather than as tools to solve problems relevant to their own needs. This type of teacher-\ncentred instructional practice, unfortunately, leads to inert knowledge (Whitehead, 1929) -\nknowledge and skills that cannot be applied to real problems, situations, and challenges.\nIf we intend to avoid the production of inert knowledge and to prepare our students to stay\ncurrent in their fields once they have left the classroom environment, we must engage them in\nthe types of knowledge-construction and problem-solving activities and thinking and learning\nprocesses they will be expected to engage in once they are on the job. The learning environment\nneeds to involve them in activities that allow them to plan, control, drive, and assess their own\n. learning activities and apply what they have learned to new challenges.\nCharacteristics of REALs\nREALs are based on the constructivist values and student-centred strategies of 'collaboration,\npersonal autonomy, generativity, reflectivity, active engagement, personal relevance, and\npluralism' (Lebow, 1993, p. 5) - values and strategies that purposefully place students in active\nand directive roles over their own learning activities. The constructivist view of learning\nassumes that knowledge acquisition is a continuous personal process of building, interpreting,\nand modifying understanding as a natural consequence of experience in the world (Goodman,\n1984; Bednar et al, 1991; Jonassen, 1994; Savery and Duffy, 1995); learning is not about the\nacquisition of new knowledge, but the constant reconstruction and refinement of what someone\nalready knows (Forman and Pufall, 1988; Fosnot, 1989). To address the problem of inert\nknowledge, the constructivist view of learning promotes the development of learning activities\nthat are embedded in a variety of authentic contexts, creating 'a rich web of memorable\nassociations between them [concepts and facts] and problem-solving concepts' (Collins,\nBrown, and Newman, 1989, p. 457). Rather than starting the learning process with abstractions\n(a characteristic of traditional education), REALs develop abstractions from authentic\nexperiences (Duffy and Grabinger, 1997) to create a rich understandings. Thus REALs possess\na specific set of characteristics that need a specific set of instructional strategies and tactics to\nhave the desired cognitive effects on learning. These characteristics are outlined below (for a\nmore detailed discussion of them see Grabinger and Dunlap, 1995, and Grabinger, 1996).\n\u2022 Student responsibility. Using self-directed learning activities, students are encouraged to\nidentify their own deficiencies, to ask questions about their knowledge base, and to select\nand manage their learning activities.\n\u2022 Dynamic, generative learning. Learning is essentially an act of active construction on the\npart of the student (Resnick, 1989) using authentic cognitive and physical processes.\n7\nScott Grabinger et al Rich environments for active learning in action: problem-based learning\n\u2022 Authentic contexts. Students acquire content and skills through the resolution of realistic\nproblems. Understandings that are developed in their realistic and complex situations are\nmore easily retrieved when needed (Brown et al, 1989).\n\u2022 Collaboration. Through collaborative group work and the accessing of a variety of\nresources, students experience and develop an appreciation for multiple perspectives, and\nlearn important co-operative skills for functioning in society.\n\u2022 Reflection. Thinking about learning experiences in terms of what one understands and how\none learns is a critical feature of all instruction. Students must be able to analyse personal\nknowledge-construction processes and articulate why and how a learning task was\ncompleted or a problem was solved (Honebein, 1996).\nIn the following section, we will use PBL to illustrate how each of these instructional\ncharacteristics come into play in a REAL to meet our new educational goals.\nProblem-based learning\nPBL is a student-centred instructional methodology that teaches content and skills within a\nknowledge domain by using substantive, carefully-crafted authentic problems or challenges\n(Boud, 1985; Savery and Duffy, 1995) as the stimulus and focus for collaborative and self-\ndirected student activity (Boud and Feletti, 1991). This differs from conventional classroom\nsituations in which problems are used as culminating activities after the teacher has presented\ncontent. In a PBL environment, the teacher presents students with authentic, ill-structured\nproblems before they receive any instruction. Students engaged in PBL investigate issues\nlooking for appropriate connections across disciplines, grapple with the complexity of the\nproblem, and use newly acquired and existing knowledge to generate solutions. During the\nprocess, students build substantial knowledge bases through increasingly self-directed study.\nThrough collaboration with classmates, students refine and enhance what they know. When a\nsolution is at hand, they present, justify, and debate solutions, looking for the best possible\nresolution to the problem.\nWe shall briefly describe the PBL process using the Network Use Problem shown in Figure 2.\nSituation\nGandD is a rapidly growing satellite TV company. It considers itself an enlight-\nened company, encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit among its employees. It\nhas a decentralized management style and manages by consensus.\nYou are a member of a special task force charged with developing policies for\ninformation use in the electronic age.Your main task for the last four months\nhas been to review how people in the Company use new information tech-\nnologies, and to develop ethical and fair guidelines for their use. For example,\nyou are going to examine use of copy machines, cell phones, fax machines,\nand the company network (intranet and lnternet).The task force's first issue\nis the company network use including such things as email and Web surfing.\nChallenge\nYour task force is to develop a set of ethical and fair guidelines to govern the\nuse of the network by employees and for monitoring of the network use by\nGandD.These guidelines will be sent to all company employees and adminis-\ntrators. You must present your guidelines in a five-minute oral report in two\nand one-half hours to the Vice President in charge of Human Resources. Figure 2: The Network\nUse Problem\n8\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 2\nIn the PBL process, the teacher is a tutor of the learning process. He\/she designs problems or\nchallenges that students use to direct their learning and thinking (read the Challenge in Figure\n2). After presenting the problem in a way that encourages student ownership (read the Situation\nFigure 2), the team 'thinks through' the problem with the guidance of the tutor. In 'thinking\nthrough' the problem, students propose ideas and hypotheses for meeting the challenge. They\ntest these ideas with each other and record them. For each idea the students generate, they\ndevelop one or more learning issues (what they need to know) that will help them refine,\neliminate, or add to their ideas. The tutor stimulates these discussions by asking 'why' and\n'how' questions to encourage students to think critically about their ideas. The tutor encourages\nstudents to restate, to summarize, and to ask for clarifications. After developing a set of ideas\nand learning issues, the team develops a plan for investigating each of the learning issues. There\nfollows a period of self-directed learning where each member of the team selects and\ninvestigates the learning issues. Though each student may investigate only a portion of the\nlearning issues, the team is responsible for ensuring that all students learn enough about all\nissues to be able to justify and defend the resulting solution to the challenge. After a period of\nself-directed learning, the team reassembles and again thinks through the problem bringing their\nnew understandings to bear on their ideas. They evaluate their initial ideas, revise them,\neliminate them, generate new ones, and generate new learning issues. The cycle repeats itself\nuntil a sound solution to the challenge is developed and presented.\nContent learning and skills development in the domain occur as natural consequences of solving\nthe problem. In fact, in a PBL environment students take on the roles of scientists, doctors,\nhistorians, programmers, engineers, advertising executives, mechanics, or any others which\nhave a stake in the problem. Therefore, the students work with problems in an authentic manner\nthat fosters reasoning, knowledge application, and lifelong learning skills.\nPBL's application of REAL characteristics\nStudent responsibility and initiative\nCreating autonomous, lifelong learners, REALs in general (and PBL specifically) teach\nstudents to manage their own learning: identify their learning needs, set learning objectives,\nselect and employ learning strategies, identify and use appropriate resources, and assess their\noverall process. In a PBL environment, students build their own knowledge bases founded on\npersonal learning needs and interests. To do this, students set goals, create action plans to\nachieve those goals, set milestones and deadlines, and identify and evaluate appropriate\nlearning strategies. Palincsar (1990) and Scardamalia and Bereiter (1991) refer to this as\n'intentional learning'. Students engaged in intentional learning are purposeful, effortful, self-\nregulated, and active learners (Palincsar and Klenk, 1992). To teach for intentional learning\nmeans to cultivate those general abilities that make it possible to become lifelong learners\n(Palincsar, 1990).\nStudent responsibility occurs throughout PBL. In the initial phase of the PBL process - referred\nto by Barrows (1985, p. 62) as 'reasoning through the problem and identifying educational\nneeds in counterpoint' - students reason aloud through the presented problem, defining what\nthey know and do not know, formulating hypotheses, clarifying understanding through\nnegotiation, critiquing peers' comments about the problem, setting educational goals, and\ncreating action plans to meet those goals. With tutor-coaching and scaffolding, these activities\n9\nScott Grabinger et al Rich environments for active learning in action: problem-based learning\nhelp students develop the self-monitoring skills necessary to relate learning needs to their ideas\nand hypotheses.\nDuring the self-directed study phase of a PBL activity, students carry out their action plans by\nengaging in self-study. They work out how long it will take to address an action plan item,\ncreate a timeline, determine the required resources, then implement the plan. They learn to\nassess the effectiveness of their plans and alter those plans when necessary. They learn to\nevaluate critically information sources and the information they are learning. They are able to\nstand aside and take a look at how they are learning in addition to what they are learning.\nDuring the reflection and review PBL phase, students reflect on and summarize what they have\nlearned, and discuss how it will be used during future problems. They work out contingencies,\nexplore alternatives to their solutions, and determine ways to improve both the solutions and the\nprocess used to arrive at them. Students consciously recall and reflect on the learning that\noccurred while they were solving the problem, elaborate on that learning, and integrate it into\ntheir existing knowledge structures (Barrows, 1985). Because PBL focuses students' attention\non their learning processes, this activity further builds the metacognitive skills needed for\nlifelong learning.\nDynamic generative learning activities\nStudents cannot construct or evolve their own learning without generating something through\ndynamic, meaningful learning activities. People who learn through active involvement create an\n'increasingly rich implicit understanding of the world' (Brown etal, 1989, p. 33) and are more\nlikely to use that learning (Adams et al, 1988; Lockhart, Lamon and Gick, 1988). Dynamic\ngenerative learning requires that students 'engage in argumentation and reflection as they try to\nuse and then refine their existing knowledge as they attempt to make sense of alternate points of\nview' (CTGV, 1993, p. 16). Argumentation and discussion form the skeleton of PBL. Students\nare taught and encouraged to test their ideas with each other, to look for flaws in reasoning, and\nto marshal supporting facts for their ideas.\nDynamic generative learning requires a shift in the traditional roles of students and instructors.\nTeachers become facilitators and tutors of the learning process rather than presenters of\nknowledge. Students in REALs and PBL become active investigators, seekers, and problem-\nsolvers working purposefully on a challenge. In generative learning, students apply the\ninformation they learn to authentic problems.\nGenerating ideas and materials is a necessary component of a PBL challenge. For example,\nstudents meet frequently in their teams to bring their self-directed learning to bear on the\nchallenge. Their learning, listening, and discussion usually generate changes in how they think\nabout the challenge and potential solutions. They must present their new understandings and\nlearning to their team-mates clearly and concisely. This may require the generation of\ndocuments or displays. The final solution to a challenge is a product consistent with the context\nof the problem, for example a presentation before a Board, a new product for distribution, or a\nmarketing plan for a business. PBL activities require students to generate overt representations\nof their learning and thinking from start to finish.\nAuthentic learning contexts\nAnother characteristic of REALs is that learning takes place within a context that requires use\nof authentic cognitive, psychomotor, and affective skills. An authentic context, such as a PBL\n10\nALT-} Vb\/ume 5 Number 2\nchallenge or problem, incorporates as much fidelity as possible to what students will encounter\noutside the education system in terms of tools, complexity, cognitive functioning, and\ninteractions with people (Williams and Dodge, 1992). Therefore, creating an authentic learning\ncontext means that students must be involved in contextualized, realistic activities that require\nrealistic thinking, movement, and emotions.\nAuthenticity is an important part of a PBL for three reasons. First, realistic problems hold more\nrelevance to students' needs and experiences because the students can relate what they are\nlearning to problems and goals they see every day (Blumenfeld et al, 1993). Second, because\nthe situations students encounter during learning are authentic and reflect the true nature of\nproblems in the real world, they develop deeper and richer (indexicalized and conditioned)\nknowledge structures (Albanese and Mitchell, 1993), leading to a higher likelihood of transfer\nto novel situations. Finally, because complex problems require a team approach that provides\nnatural opportunities for learners to test and refine their ideas and to help each other understand\nthe content, PBL encourages collaboration and negotiation (Johnson and Johnson, 1979; Lowry\nand Johnson, 1981).\nPBL challenges come from real situations: today's headlines, business and community\nproblems, and student interests. The following examples describe two ways to present authentic\nactivities using the PBL methodology (Savery and Duffy, 1995). Example 1 describes the\n'grand problem' way of presenting a challenge to students. The 'grand problem' is presented in\na summarized, problem-statement format that gives students the information they need to begin\ninvestigating and solving the problem (see also Figure 2). Example 2 describes a way of\npresenting PBL problems using authentic materials. The authentic materials present students\nwith clues to the problem; students must determine what the problem is by examining the\ninformation from a number of different sources in much the same way as people gather clues\nfrom a variety of sources when they are on the job. These sources can be memos, interviews,\nstatements of work, notes from meetings with clients, sketches and diagrams, and so forth. The\npower of this type of PBL problem presentation is that it engages students in authentic activity\nfrom problem identification to problem solution and implementation, allowing them to practise\nthe types of problem-identification activities they will be expected to do on the job.\nExample 1\nThe challenge statement: many school district decision makers do not believe that instructional\ntechnologies play an important role in education today. In fact, the school Board is preparing a\npolicy to prevent the expenditure of any more money for technology for 12 months. They will be\nvoting on the policy next month. Your team of faculty from the district must create a 15-minute\npresentation that argues for or against their proposed policy.\nThis particular example came from an article in a local paper in which a local school district\nwas proposing just such a policy. The class members working on the challenge were teachers in\na Master's degree program in information and learning technologies. The possibility of being\nconfronted by such a proposal was authentic to them. The nature of the presentation included a\ntime limit because the school Board limited arguments. In preparing the presentation, students\nhad to look into how technology was used in their districts, define instructional technologies,\nand prepare an argument supporting or refuting the Board's proposed policy.\nExample 2\nFor an undergraduate computer-programming course in which the course objectives were to\nII\nScott Grabinger et ol Rich environments for active learning in action: problem-based learning\ndevelop an understanding of the C++ language syntax and object-oriented design and\nprogramming techniques, PBL was used to structure student activity (Dunlap, 1996). Following\nPBL methodology, the course was designed to engage students in four different programming\nproblems in which students met course objectives by solving problems. Spanning three to five\nweeks, each project required students to learn specific content and skills in order to develop\nviable solutions. Students were immediately placed in the role of C++ programmers for a\ncontracting company. In this role, students were assigned client-based projects for which they\nwere required to develop solutions. Each project was presented via authentic materials\ndocumenting the nature and requirements of the project. For example, in the second project\nstudents had to develop an electronic card catalogue system for a library that would allow\nsearches to be conducted on the information in the library's main database. All of the project's\nrequirements and constraints were contained in office memos, transcripts of interviews with\nlibrary personnel, and newspaper clippings - emulating the way in which programmers in the\nbusiness world often get their information from clients.\nEach had four phases, reflecting Barrow's (1985) phases of the PBL process. The first phase -\nProblem Analysis - began with students examining the authentic materials. After students had\nhad an opportunity to examine the authentic materials, the instructor created four columns on\nthe whiteboard with the following headings: Ideas, Facts, Learning Issues, and Action Plan.\nUsing these columns as a guide, the instructor helped students examine the authentic materials\nin such a way as to draw out the client's requirements. Students quickly generated ideas on what\nthe solution might look like ('We will want to create classes for books, periodicals, films, and\nvideos.') and factual information from the authentic materials (\"The e-mail from \"aschwartz\"\nsays the files will be pipe delimited.'). As the session progressed, learning issues were\nidentified that would require additional study ('How does a list work?'). Finally, an action plan\nwas developed to guide the students' activities so they could begin to solve the client's problem.\nThe second phases of each project - Project Design - involved students working together in\ngroups of three to design a solution for the client while adhering to the requirements and\nconstraints identified in the first phase. During the next two weeks, the class broke into their\nproject teams to design an on-paper solution to the problem identified during Problem Analysis.\nStudents worked together using a variety of resources, including books, online help, experts,\ninstructor, Internet resources, and sample code. Towards the end of the two weeks, project\nteams shared their designs with each other to test their ideas, generate additional ideas, and\nverify or modify their understandings. At the end of each class period, the class reconvened to\ndiscuss previous learning issues, generate new learning issues, and update the action plan.\nThese modifications to learning issues and action plan were made to the original four columns\nused in Phase 1.\nAfter Project Design came the Project Development phase. The Project Development phase\nrequired each student to program the solution using the design created by the project team as a\nblueprint. Students spent time in class coding a solution to meet the client's requirements. Class\nmeetings were used as an opportunity for students to discuss problems they encountered while\ncoding, and to share the solutions they had developed to solve those problems. Periodically, the\nclass as a whole was reconvened to address issues that the class was encountering and to update\nthe action plan.\nThe final phase - Post Project Review - happened once students finished coding a solution.\n12\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 2\nThis review was used to discuss the C++ and object-oriented techniques students used, share\nsolutions and discuss possible alternatives, and to answer any lingering questions. It was also\nused as a time for students to reflect on the process itself, discussing what learning strategies\nthey employed, what strategies worked and did not work, and what they would do differently\nwhen solving future programming problems.\nIn addition to the review that occurred during these four phases, an additional review\ncomponent was incorporated. These were referred to as 'in-progress reviews'. At several points\nduring the course of a project, the instructor would bring the class together as a whole to discuss\nissues related to project status, design and programming problems, and possible solutions. The\nin-progress reviews also encouraged students to reflect on the strategies they were employing\nand the effectiveness of those strategies, to reassess their status regarding personal learning\nissues, and to adjust their personal action plans if needed.\nIn the context of working on the problem, students often take on roles that lead to authentic\ndecision making, such as those of engineer, policy maker, school Board member, or executive\nBoards. These roles help lend more authenticity to the problem, for learners must not only solve\nthe problem, but also act consistently within the role they play. By engaging in authentic\nactivities that reflect the work environment for which they are being prepared, students have an\nopportunity to practise applying knowledge and skills to new problems, improving their ability\nto transfer their knowledge and skills to future challenges.\nCollaboration\nCollaboration acknowledges the social nature of knowledge construction (Roth, 1990). 'All co-\noperative learning methods share the idea that students work together to learn and are\nresponsible for one another's learning as well as their own6 (Slavin, 1991, p. 73). Working in\npeer groups helps students refine their knowledge through argumentation, structured\ncontroversy, and the sharing and testing of ideas and perspectives.\nCollaboration plays several important roles in PBL. First, PBL employs collaboration to\nprovide students with opportunities to see and hear how other students approach and solve\nproblems. During the problem-analysis phase of PBL, students describe what they know and do\nnot know about a problem and what they need to learn. Being able to determine learning needs\nand to plan a method of attack are important metacognitive skills for lifelong learners. Because\nstudents are working collaboratively during problem solving, their thinking processes - or\nmetacognitive skills - are observable and therefore open for personal and peer assessment and\nrefinement. Students test ideas, identify misconceptions, and challenge each others' thinking.\nGroup participation means that the members must understand many different roles and\nviewpoints to gain additional insights to the problem.\nSecond, PBL problems are complex. Students may not be used to or able to tackle a realistic\nproblem on their own. Students working together collaboratively can often successfully tackle\nproblems that individual students working alone would not be able to handle; collaborative\nlearning can 'give rise synergistically to insights and solutions that would not come about\nwithout them [the members of the collaborative group]' (Brown etal, 1989, p. 40).\nFinally, collaboration develops important collaborative work skills. Students learn to work\ntogether in a give-and-take interaction rather than just dividing the workload. They learn to\nwork in a team framework that emphasizes discussion, testing ideas, and revising ideas.\n13\nScott Qvbinger et al Rich environments for active learning in action: problem-based learning\nReflection and review\nIf there one defining feature of REALs can be said to be more important than the others, it is\nreflection. Reflection activities are embedded into instructional activities to support both\nunderstanding and the development of metacognitive skills. Dewey (1933) described the value\nof reflection as a component of educated thinking. By reflecting on their activities, students\nabstract and summarize what they learn in terms of content and skills, and review how they\nsolved a problem. Students need to move from the specific instance that the problem provides\nand abstract what is generalizable to other situations. They also need to examine the strategies,\nprocesses, tools, and resources they used, making personal recommendations for future use.\nThe final phase of a PBL activity is summary and integration of learning. If this phase is\nskipped or cut short, the full impact of students' PBL experience is lost. During this phase,\nstudents reflect on and summarize what they have learned and discuss how it will be used\nduring future problems. They look for generalizable principles and understandings and discuss\nother scenarios and domains in which they may apply. In addition, the reflective activities that\ntake place during PBL's review phase encourage students to make tacit cognitive and\nmetacognitive activities overt so that they can assess and improve the activities. Having\nopportunities to reflect on metacognitive skill utilization is necessary if students are expected to\ndevelop these skills to the point of using them without prompting or guidance.\nConclusion\nThe information age is placing a premium on educated people who can think creatively and\nflexibly, solve problems, and make decisions within complex, ill-structured environments.\nGiven these changes, we must modify our traditional assumptions about learning and education.\nThese new assumptions require student-centred methods, techniques and strategies that\nencourage the development of student responsibility and the use of dynamic, generative, and\nauthentic learning activities. PBL is an excellent example of a student-centred instructional\nmethodology based on a constructivist view of learning. Enabling content acquisition and the\ndevelopment of problem-solving and lifelong learning skills, PBL provides a way for educators\nto adhere to the principles of a constructivist view of learning in order to prepare students to\nmeet the demands of a changing workplace and society. And PBL fulfils the educational\noutcomes of REALs by involving students in learning activities that focus on (Barrows, 1985;\nBridges, 1992; Schmidt, 1993; Gijselaers, 1995,1995b; Savery and Duffy, 1995):\n\u2022 the acquisition of an essential body of transferable knowledge and skills;\n\u2022 the development of critical reasoning and problem-solving skills needed to meet new and\nnovel challenges; and\n\u2022 the development lifelong learning skills to extend or improve their knowledge and skills in\norder to remain contemporary.\nReferences\nAdams, L., Kasserman, J., Yearwood, A., Perfetto, G., Bransford, J. and Franks, J.
