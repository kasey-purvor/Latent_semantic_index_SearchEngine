Introduction \n Dermatophytoses are common among skin diseases worldwide. Even in Europe, \ninfections such as tinea capitis are an increasing problem [5]. Although, resistance to \nantibiotics among dermatophyte species is very uncommon, determination of the in vitro \nsusceptibility of dermatophytes, particularly for management of treatment failures, may \nprove helpful [1]. Many techniques, such as agar-based methods (dilution and diffusion) \nand broth dilution, have been used for antifungal susceptibility testing (AST) but there is no \nstandard method for AST of dermatophytes [2, 9].  However, because dermatophytes grow \nslowly, agar-based methods have often been employed [14]. These methods are time-, \nlabour-, and resource-intensive which make them unsuitable for rapid screening \nprogrammes. So, there is a need for novel and quick alternative laboratory approaches.  \n All micro-organisms produce by-products as a result of their normal metabolism \n[17]. Some of these metabolic by-products, including alcohols, aliphatic acids, ketones and \nterpens are volatile at low temperature and are known as volatile organic compounds \n(VOCs). Many VOCs have characteristic odours. Since the production patterns of VOCs \nare unique to certain micro-organisms (or disorders), they can potentially be used as \nbiomarkers [19]. Quantitative analysis of VOCs has almost exclusively been based on gas \nchromatography-mass spectrometry which is time-consuming, relatively expensive, and \nrequired skilled operators [17, 19]. However, rapid qualitative analysis of volatile \nproduction patterns by means of electronic nose (E-nose) devices for early detection and \ndiscrimination of infections [3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 18, 15, 16] or non-infectious diseases such \nas lung cancer and diabetes mellitus  [4, 13, 19] has yielded promising results.  \n The aims of this work were to study the potential of using a hybrid sensor array as a \nrapid screening method for antifungal agents for controlling dermatophytes using the drugs \nand other antioxidants using volatile fingerprints. To achieve these objectives we (a) \n 4 \ndetermined the growth responses of two Trichophyton species, T. rubrum and T. \nmentagrophytes, against five antifungal agents (itraconazole, griseofulvin, butylated \nhydroxyanisole, octyl gallate and n-propyl-p- hydroxybenzoate), (b) calculated the effective \ndoses for inhibition of 50 and 90% growth (EC50 and EC90); (c) at these EC50 and EC90 \nconcentrations, the effect on the volatile production patterns by these two fungi when \ngrown for up to 96-120 hrs was evaluated and compared with negative and positive controls \nbased on the responses of the hybrid sensor array system. PCA and CA were used to \nexamine the potential for discriminating between antifungal treatments and the controls.   \n \n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1 Fugal isolates \n Two Trichophyton species, T. rubrum (No. 115) and T. mentagrophytes (No. 224), \nwere used in this study. The Trichophyton species were human isolates and obtained from \nthe National Collection of Pathogenic Fungi (NCPF), Bristol, UK. \n \n2.2 Growth medium \n Sabouraud\u2019s dextrose agar (SDA) medium was prepared in house by mixing 10 g l-1 \nmycological peptone (Amersham, Little Chalfont, UK; Oxoid, UK), 40 g l\n-1 \nglucose (Acros \nChemicals, Belgium), and 15 g l\n-1 \nagar Technical No.3 (Oxoid, UK). At the end, 0.05 g l\n-1 \nchloramphenicol (Sigma, UK) was added.  \n \n2.3 Antifungal agents \n Two antifungal drugs, itraconazole (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Belgium) and \ngriseofulvin (Darou Pakhsh Co., Iran), and three antioxidants including butylated \nhydroxyanisole (BHA; C11H16O2) (Sigma, US), octyl gallate (O-G; C15H22O5) (Fluka \n 5 \nChemie GmbH, Germany) and n-propyl-p- hydroxybenzoate (P-P; C10H12O3) (Sigma, US) \nwere used in this research work. All antioxidants are considered as Generally Recognized \nAs Safe (GRAS) compounds. For each drug, a stock solution with a concentration of 100 \n\u03bcg ml-1 was prepared by dissolving 2mg of anti-fungal agent in 20 ml of 99.5% dimethyl \nsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma, US). For antioxidants and based on the molecular weight of \neach preparation, a stock solution with the concentration of 1 mM in 20 ml of 99% ethanol \nwas made. Stock solutions were stored at 4\u00b0C. \n \n2.4 E.nose system \n An AppliedSensor 3320 E-nose (AppliedSensor Group, Sweden) was \nemployed in this study. The core sensor technology of this machine is based on a hybrid \narray of 10 metal-oxide-silicon field-effect-transistor (MOSFET) sensors and 12 metal \noxide sensors (MOS), and a capacitance-based relative humidity sensor. These sensors are \nprovided as standard in this specific system. The MOSFET sensors were sensitive to \nhydrogen, amines (MOSFET 101A); amines and esters (MOSFET 102A); aldhydes and \nalcohols (MOSFET 103A); hydrogen (MOSFET 104A); hydrogen and amines (MOSFET \n105A); amines, aldehydes, esters, alcohols and ketones (MOSFET 101B); hydrogen, \namines and alcohols (MOSFET 102B); amines, aromatics, aldehydes, esters, ketenes and \nalcohols (MOSFET 103B); hydrogen (MOSFET 104B) and amines, aldehydes, esters and \nketones (MOSFET 105B). The sensor array was heated to 140\no\nC. \nThe 12 MOS sensors were specific for air contaminants such as hydrogen and \ncarbon monoxide (MOS 101); hydrocarbons (MOS 102); alcohols, organic solvents (MOS \n104); hydrocarbons (MOS 110); methane (MOS 111); propane and butane (MOS 112); \nhydrogen (MOS 113); organic solvents (MOS 114); alcohol (MOS 115); Freon (MOS 116); \nammonia (MOS 117); organic solvents, alcohol and hydrogen (MOS 118).  \n 6 \n  The E.nose system used has a 12 vial auto-sampler system. The 30 ml volume vials \nwere sealed and placed into the sample holders which were maintained at 30\no\nC. The \ncomputerized programme used consisted of 30 sec to obtain the base line, 30 sec to take a \nsample, 200 sec flushing, resulting in a total time of 4.20 mins. There are two gas filters \nconnected to the inlet including a drying column of silica gel which acts as moisture trap, \nand a hydrocarbon filter which is in two parts, one is a moisture filter and the other is an \nactive carbon adsorbent. The individual sample holders for the vials are temperature \ncontrolled at 37\no\nC to maintain stability of presentation of vials for head space analyses. \nOnly when equilibration has been achieved does the system become operative. The air \nenters the system at a flow rate 60 ml min. The divergence response of each sensor was \nused in all analyses.   \n \n2.5 Determination of EC50 and EC90 values \n Molten SDA media were serially diluted with stock solutions of itraconazole and \ngriseofulvin so that 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 \u03bcg ml-1 treatments were obtained. SDA media \nwere also amended with two different antioxidant combinations (BHA + P-P; O-G + P-P) \nto obtain final concentrations of 20 mM and 40 mM. Modified media were poured in 9cm \nplastic Petri plates and for each species, three replicate plates of each treatment and plain \nSDA (as control) were inoculated centrally with a 0.5 mm diameter mycelial agar plug \ntaken from the margin of actively growing cultures of T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes on \nSDA. Plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C in dark and mycelial extension diameters were daily \nmeasured in two perpendicular directions for 14 days. Tests were repeated with griseofulvin \nand antioxidants-amended plates over a narrower range of 0.025, 0.050, 0.100, 0.200 \u03bcg ml-\n1\n concentrations. The EC50 and EC90 values of all antifungal agents involved in the study for \nT. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes were calculated by linear regression of the temporal \n 7 \nextension rates and then plotting the relative growth rates (mm day\n-1\n) to compare \ntreatments. The treatment list is shown in Table 1. All experiments were carried out with \nthree replicates per treatment and carried out twice.  \n \n2.6 Procedure used for e.nose analyses \nSubsequently, for each antifungal agent (single or combined, for each of the 5 treatment \ntypes) tested, molten SDA media were amended with the related calculated EC50 and EC90 \nvalues per species (T.rubrum, T.mentographytes) and poured into 9 cm plastic Petri plates. \nA total of 5 replicates per treatment for each time of analyses were prepared and these were \ninoculated with 0.25 ml of a 10\n6\n spore mL\n-1 \nsuspension of each species and spread plate on \nthe agar surface with a sterile bent Pasteur pipette. Negative and positive controls were used \nas additional treatments. These were incubated at 25\u00b0C in the dark for up to 120 hours. At \neach time point, four 2 cm diameter agar plugs from 5 replicate plates of each treatment \nwere destructively sampled using a sterile cork borer and placed in sample vials (30 ml) \nwhich were sealed with a septum and screw-top lid. After one hour to allow sample \nequilibration the vial headspaces were analysed using the E-nose system. The headspace \nvolume was approx. 25 ml and this was sampled automatically by a needle from the sample \nport which was then retracted into the e.nose. A second needle replaced the volume of \nheadspace removed with filtered air. The headspace volatiles were automatically passed \nthrough the sensor chamber and over the heated sensor arrays. The air relative humidity \nover the sensor array was found to be in the range 15-30% based on the relative humidity \nsensor included in the array. The flow rate and times for each part of the cycle were \ndetailed previously. Every few weeks we also included standards of specific volatiles of \nisopropanol, ethanol, acetone (1-2%) and de-ionised water to ensure that the results \nobtained from sensors were consistent over time when the responses were plotted using \n 8 \nPCA analyses and compared over time. Overall, separation of specific standards based on \nthe responses are consistent over time. The cultures grown for 96-120 hours (five \nindependent replicates per treatment at each time) were used. These were chosen as they \nrepresented times at which the early stages of microscopic and visible growth occur and \nwhen identification of these types of fungi is often difficult.  \n \n2.7 Data analysis  \n Mycelial growth assays data were analysed by Microsoft Excel. NSTSenstool \nsoftware (an in-built software package in the AppliedSensor 3320 machine) was employed \nto perform principal components analysis (PCA) on the response parameter (mean-centred \ndata) which also indicated the maximum peak response for the various sensors. These data \nwere also analysed by cluster analysis (CA) using Statistica 8.  \n \n3. Results \n3.1 Effective concentration values \n Growth rates relative to the controls (data not shown) were used to determine the \nEC50 and EC90 values for antifungal agent concentrations (Figure 1; Table 1). Except for the \nantioxidant combinations of BHA + P-P where the actual EC90 values for T. rubrum and T. \nmentagrophytes were calculated, for other antifungal agents in the study the highest \nemployed concentration in each experiment was equivalent to the EC90 values.   \n \n3.2 Early differentiation between inoculated antifungal treatments and controls \n Figure 2 shows that there was very good reproducibility of the response of ten \nMOSFET sensors as an example, to five replicates of T. mentagrophytes growing on plain \nSDA. Figure 3 presents the PCA of the response of the hybrid sensor based E-nose to \n 9 \ninoculated treatments of amended SDA with the EC50 and EC90 values of itraconazole and \nthe fungal species grown on antifungal-free SDA (as positive controls) together with blank \nSDA medium (as a negative control) and un-inoculated amended SDA at 2.00 \u03bcg ml-1 of \nitraconazole after 96 hours. There was a clear separation between the inoculated and un-\ninoculated itraconazole treatments, and the negative controls. Because the Trichophyton \nspecies did not grow at the EC90 values there was no separation after 96 hours based on \nvolatile fingerprints. This however accounted for 97.6% of the data described by the first \ntwo principal components (PC). After 120 hours growth there was also distinct clusters of \nthe two dermatophytes growing on un-amended SDA, with these treatments clearly \ndifferentiated from other treatments (Figure 4). \nFigure 5 shows the CA after 96 hours, using Euclidean distances and Ward\u2019s \nmethod, for the treatments using griseofulvin as the test antifungal agent. This showed two \ntight clusters of the T. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes replicates growing on plain SDA, and \nclearly shows the T.rubrum EC50 replicates grouped separately. However, for the other \ntreatments there was a mixed group with no clear differentiation after 96 hrs.     \n \n3.3. Effect of anti-oxidant treatments  \n Analysis of the data related to the response of the E-nose sensors to different anti-\noxidant treatments (BHA + P-P treatments) by PCA after 96 hours showed three clusters of \nT. rubrum and T. mentagrophytes growing on SDA, and T. mentagrophytes growing on \nSDA at the EC50 concentration of the antioxidant combination discriminated from other \ntreatments, which were all grouped together. This accounted for 94.9% of the data \ndescribed by PCs 1, 2 and 9. After 96 hrs using the Euclidian distances, the dendrogram \nshows that to a large extent the positive controls of the two species (T.rubrum, \nT.mentographites) and EC50 concentration replicates could be effectively differentiated \n 10 \n(Figure 6). This was unclear for the EC90 treatments. After 120 hours, examination of the  \nPCA map showed four distinct groups of dermatophyte species growing on SDA and that \namended with the EC50 concentration of BHA + P-P per species, clearly separated from the \nother treatments (Figure 7).  \n \n \n4. Discussion \n This is the first study to investigate the potential of using the E-nose as a qualitative \nscreening tool for rapid assessment of the responses of dermatophytes to antifungal agents. \nAlthough growth on agar was used to determine the EC values of some antifungal agents, \noverall, the results showed that it was possible to discriminate between T. rubrum and T.  \nmentagrophytes growing on un-amended solid media (SDA) from those inoculated on \nantifungal-modified media as early as 96 hours after incubation by analysing their volatile \nproduction patterns.  \n In the presence of a commonly used antifungal drug, itraconazole, the Trichophyton \nspecies, growing on control media and those amended with the EC50 and EC90 values of the \ndrug were successfully differentiated after 96-120 hours. This supports previous studies \nwith four Trichophyton species which showed differentiation within 96 hours using \nqualitative volatile fingerprints [15]. The results also revealed a similarity in the volatile \nproduction patterns of control media and those dermatophytes inoculated on antifungal \nmodified media and hence the inhibition of growth by the antifungal drugs within the same \ntime-point. Itraconazole is an azole agent which inhibits ergosterol synthesis in the fungal \ncell wall by inhibiting fungal cytochrome 14\u03b1- demethylase, and when given topically, may \ncause direct damage to the fungal cytoplasmic membrane [9].    \nThe results of the griseofulvin test suggest that fungal age of cultures may affect the \ndiscrimination achieved. Differences were not very clear after 96 hrs. However, after 120 \n 11 \nhrs clear differentiation between treatments of the EC90 values of griseofulvin and negative \ncontrols were similar to those in the itraconazole study. Griseofulvin, a fungistatic drug, \nacts in a different way, by inhibition of the formation of intracellular microtubules [6].  \n Detailed studies on potential alternative antioxidant compounds for the control of \ndermatophytes have not previously been investigated. Working with the experimental \ncombination of BHA+P-P, the E-nose could successfully discriminate between three to four \ntreatments of Trichophyton species growing on antifungal-free media and those modified \nwith the EC50 values. The clear separation of negative controls and inoculated treatments at \nEC90 values from others within 96-120 hours indicated inhibition of growth similar to that \nfor existing drugs such as itraconazole and griseofulvin. This also showed that the E-nose \nwas able to differentiate between closely related treatments, notably those of the \nTrichophyton species growing on control media and on media amended to the EC50 value of \nthe combination per species.  \n It was observed that the antifungal agents incorporated into the un-inoculated media \ndid not affect the quality of the volatiles and therefore the process of discrimination. \nPrevious studies have demonstrated that detection of micro-organisms in potable water in \nthe presence of low quantities of heavy metals may modify their activity and thus the \nvolatile production patterns enabling further separation to be made. Other studies have also \nshown that the nature of the culture media will influence the production of volatiles by \nmicro-organisms [17, 19]. In contrast, Sahgal et al. [15] found that, regardless of medium \nthe volatile fingerprints were could help in discrimination between four Trichophyton \nspecies.   \nTo our knowledge, this is the first study that has employed qualitative volatile \nfingerprints for rapid screening of the susceptibility of dermatophytes to antifungal agents. \nThe study shows the reproducibility of the method and the potential of using this approach \n 12 \nas a quick and simple way of qualitative screening of the responses of dermatphytoses to \nantifungal agents. \n \n5. Conclusions \n At the present, mould fungi, particularly dermatophytes, are not routinely tested for \nsusceptibility [6, 14]. Most studies have focused on the selection of a medium that supports \nconidial formation in T. rubrum or susceptibility testing of dermatophytes isolated from \npatients by using the protocols of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and \nthe European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) [1, 2, 14]. \nThese methods are resource and time-consuming. In contrast, the detection of VOCs by the \nsensor array of an E-nose has many advantages [4]. The E-nose is non-invasive, sensitive, \nportable and relatively inexpensive and has a broad range of potential applications [4]. The \ncurrent study demonstrated the potential for the rapid screening of novel antifungal \ncompounds using volatile fingerprints and also offers the potential of use of this approach \nfor monitoring the potential build up of resistance to specific anti-fungal or indeed anti-\nmicrobial drugs. By examining the PCA maps it would be possible to identify when poor \ncontrol is being achieved by having both positive and negative controls on a regular basis \nfor comparison. \n \nAcknowledgments \nWe are grateful to Gloucestershire NHS Foundation Trust for financial support to Dr. K. \nNaraghi. \n \n \n \n 13 \nReferences \n[1]  Z.
