We now demonstrate WNV-specific seroconversion\nin sentinel chickens raised on an English farm. Maternal neutralizing antibodies to WNV in\nhatchlings declined within three weeks. During the following months, healthy chickens developed\nWNV neutralizing antibodies that were confirmed by immunoblotting and indirect\nimmunofluorescence tests using WNV antigens. The proportion of seropositive chickens was\nhigher for WNV than for Usutu virus or Sindbis virus. Attempts to isolate infectious virus or to\ndetect viral RNA in the sera, failed.\nBackground\nWest Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are anti-\ngenically closely related mosquito-borne members of the\ngenus Flavivirus. Sindbis virus (SINV) is an unrelated mos-\nquito-borne member of the genus Alphavirus. These\narthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), and many others,\nare known to circulate globally as pathogens amongst\nbirds and mammalian species [1-4]. During their natural\nlife cycles, they infect ornithophilic Culex spp. mosquitoes\nthat replicate and transmit the viruses to birds and\/or\nmammals when they feed on them. Fatal encephalitic\ninfections of avian species have been recorded for WNV in\nNorth America [5-7], and Israel, [8] and for USUV in Aus-\ntria [9]. Nevertheless, many healthy avian species have\nantibodies to these viruses, demonstrating that they are\nnot necessarily pathogenic for all species they infect. On\nthe other hand, WNV and SINV are known human patho-\ngens and have been shown to be pathogenic for a very\nwide range of other mammalian species both in North\nAmerica and in the Old World [10]. Previous serological\nstudies on sera collected from UK resident and migratory\nbirds demonstrated the presence of WNV-specific neutral-\nizing antibodies and also small fragments of RNA with\nsequence corresponding to WNV. We also previously\ndemonstrated the presence of WNV-reactive envelope and\nnon-structural protein (NS1) antibodies by western blot\nanalysis and by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) tests\nusing WNV-infected tissue culture cells as the substrate for\nthe IF tests. The presence of antibodies to NS1 protein\ninferred that the virus had replicated in the birds since\nnon-structural proteins are only produced in infected cells\nafter virus replication, ie they would not be present in an\nintroduced virus. However, in view of the need for addi-\ntional proof of the presence of WNV circulating amongst\nbirds in the UK, albeit apparently harmlessly, we have\nlooked for evidence of seroconversion to WNV, USUV and\nSINV in sentinel chickens.\nPublished: 04 September 2006\nVirology Journal 2006, 3:71 doi:10.1186\/1743-422X-3-71\nReceived: 13 July 2006\nAccepted: 04 September 2006\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/3\/1\/71\n\u00a9 2006 Buckley et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nVirology Journal 2006, 3:71 http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/3\/1\/71Results and discussion\nPlaque reduction neutralization tests on sentinel chicken \nsera\nAll sera were tested for the presence of virus-specific neu-\ntralizing antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization\ntests (PRNT50) against two strains of WNV, a strain iso-\nlated from Israel (WN-Is) and a highly neutralization-sen-\nsitive strain isolated in the Central African Republic (WN-\nDAK). For these tests the sera were diluted in twofold steps\nfrom 1\/10 dilution, the minimum possible, owing to the\nlimited volume of serum. The World Health Organization\n(WHO) standard method based on 50% plaque reduction\nwas employed to detect positive virus-neutralizing sera.\nFollowing the WHO recommendations, the highest dilu-\ntion of serum that produced 50% reduction of plaque\nnumbers (estimated 50 plaques per dish in control\ndishes) was taken as the endpoint for individual sera. In\naddition we also included USUV and SINV in this analysis\nbecause it extended the range of viruses analysed and also\nserved as a form of internal control for virus-specificity.\nThe results of plaque reduction neutralization tests\n(PRNT50) on the individual sera are presented in Fig 1.\nThe inclusion of two strains of WNV maximized the data\nas we have previously demonstrated differences in sensi-\ntivity to neutralization of virus infectivity between differ-\nent strains of WNV [3]. As shown in Fig. 1, the sera from\n6\/10 and 8\/10 of the four-day old chicks neutralized\nWNV-DAK and WN-Is respectively, presumably reflecting\nthe presence of maternal antibody in the hatched chicks.\nFor USUV, 5\/10 newly hatched chick sera contained\ndetectable neutralizing antibody but they were not neces-\nsarily the same chicks that produced antibody against\nWNV, demonstrating the specificity of the neutralization\ntest. However, by the time the chicks were 10 days old, the\nproportion of maternally derived neutralization positive\nsera against the two strains of WNV and against USUV had\ndropped to 2\/20, 0\/20 and 2\/20 respectively and at days\n21 and 46 the figures remained low, ie 3\/20, 0\/20 and 0\/\n20 at day 21, but by day 46 the figures showed evidence of\nincreasing, ie 1\/10, 3\/10 and 2\/10. In the case of SINV, 4\/\n10 four-day old chicks were positive. This figure then\ndropped to 4\/20 ten-day old chicks and 0\/20 chicks by\nday 21 and was still zero at day 46. From this time\nonwards, the proportion of WNV positive sera increased\nnoticeably, until by October 8\/8, and 7\/8 of the sera were\npositive for WN-DAK and WN-Is respectively. In many\ncases the titres of these sera were noticeably higher than\nthose recorded in previous months. In contrast, the pro-\nportions of seropositive chickens for USUV and SINV\nremained lower than those observed for WNV, once again\ndemonstrating that the PRNT can discriminate between\nWNV and USUV. It is important to note that the major\nincreases in WNV-antibody positive sera were detected in\nsamples collected from late July to the end of September,\nNeutralization results (PRNT50) obtained for all sentinel chicken sera tested against each of the four viruses and grouped according o age at ime of samplingFig e 1\nNeutralization results (PRNT50) obtained for all sentinel chicken sera tested against each of the four viruses and grouped \naccording to age at time of sampling.

Moreover,\nthe results in Fig. 1 emphasise the importance of using a\nhighly neutralization sensitive strain of virus, in this case\nthe WN-DAK strain.\nInterestingly, thirteen chicks sampled at 9 weeks post-\nhatching had been kept indoors for the entire period since\nhatching. Nevertheless, specific antibody responses to\nWNV in particular were detected in these chicks, viz., 12\/\n13, and 6\/13, for WNV-DAK and WNV-Is respectively and\n1\/13, and 3\/13 for USUV and SINV respectively. However,\nwhilst these chicks had been kept indoors, the airflows to\ntheir rooms came directly from the outside without isola-\ntion by filtration.\nWestern blot analysis\nWestern blot analysis of sera was performed, to confirm\nthe presence of antibodies to viral envelope glycoprotein,\n7% w\/v polyethylene-glycol-precipitated virus was puri-\nfied by centrifugation at 100,000 g on a continuous\nsucrose gradient (15% to 60% w\/w sucrose in Tris buffer\nat pH 7.4). Serial fractions were collected from the sucrose\ngradient and subjected to immunoblotting using a high\ntitre hyperimmune mouse antiserum prepared against\nWNV. Whilst many fractions contained large quantities of\nthe recognized structural WNV proteins, the fraction col-\nlected from the 60% sucrose cushion produced a very\nstrong and relatively clean band at 51kDa on the western\nblot, corresponding to the viral envelope (E) protein of\nWNV as confirmed (data not shown but equivalent\nappearance to track 1 of Fig 2) using an E protein-specific\nmonoclonal antibody (MAb) designated MAb 528 [11].\nWNV-neutralization positive chicken sera were tested for\nthe presence of E protein-specific antibodies using the gra-\ndient-purified fraction obtained from the 60% sucrose\ncushion (Fig. 2). As can be seen, tracks 3 to 10 produced\nincreasingly intense labelling of the E protein when tested\nat a 1\/100 dilution. These tracks corresponded to sera\nwith neutralization titres of 1\/10 (tracks 3 and 4), 1\/20\n(tracks 5 and 6), 1\/40 (tracks 7 and 8), and 1\/80 (tracks 9\nand 10). Track 1 contained a positive control hyperim-\nmune mouse antiserum against WNV and Track 2 con-\ntained a negative control hyperimmune antiserum raised\nagainst SINV (both positive and negative control sera were\ndiluted 1\/500). Chicken sera that failed to neutralize\nWNV were negative in immunoblots when tested at 1\/100\ndilution. The bands at 45, 42 and 36 kDa in track 9 of Fig\n2 probably correspond to breakdown products of the E\nprotein. They were only detected by chicken sera with the\nhighest neutralization titres (tracks 9 and 10 of Fig 2).

Vero\ncells infected with WNV for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C were\nwashed in PBS and fixed in acetone. The diluted chicken\nserum was allowed to react with the acetone-fixed infected\ncells for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C before the cells were washed in\nPBS. Fluorescein-conjugated anti-chicken serum diluted\n1\/400 in PBS was used to identify the fluorescent infected\ncells. Fig. 3 illustrates the typical appearance of groups of\nWNV-infected fluorescent cells produced by PRNT-posi-\ntive chicken antisera. In Fig. 3, non-infected cells are not\nstained by the antibody. Moreover, PRNT-negative con-\ntrol sera produced no fluorescence (not shown).\nAttempts to isolate infectious virus from seropositive \nchickens\nThe sera from 46-day old, and older chickens (a total of 46\nsera) and five 10% brain suspensions harvested from\nchickens that were seropositive in a WNV-PRNT-analysis\nwere inoculated directly onto monolayers of SW13 cells\nwhich were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 14 days. The\nsupernatant medium from each sample was then inocu-\nlated onto fresh monolayers of SW13 cells and these were\nincubated for a further 14 days. Each monolayer from the\nfirst inoculation and subsequently each monolayer from\nthe second inoculation was tested for the presence of fla-\nvivirus antigens using a flavivirus pan-specific mono-\nclonal antibody (MAb 813), followed by fluorescein-\nconjugated mouse antiglobulin, as described previously\n[11]. Although some monolayers deteriorated during the\nincubation period, suggesting that cytopathic effects (cpe)\nwere developing, we were unable to demonstrate the pres-\nence of an infectious flavivirus in any of the tested sam-\nples either by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy\nusing flavivirus-group-reactive MAb 813 or by RT-PCR\nusing flavivirus-group-reactive primers [12]. Moreover,\nthe mild cpe that was observed in some cultures was not\nobserved during subsequent passage of harvested mate-\nrial, ruling out the possibility of a different cytopathic\narbovirus being isolated.\nAlthough it was not possible to obtain sequential samples\nof serum from each animal the PRNT studies with groups\nof newly hatched, juvenile and young adult chickens pro-\nduced evidence that these animals had been exposed\neither to infectious WNV or a very closely related virus\nduring the summer of 2004. The supplementary positive\nresults obtained by immunoblotting and immunofluores-\ncence microscopy also support this conclusion by demon-\nstrating specific immune responses against the WNV\nenvelope protein. Many of the newly hatched chicks had\nantibodies that neutralized WNV and to a lesser extent\nUSUV and SINV. It is well known that maternal antibod-\nies are concentrated in the fertile egg and that the quantity\nof these antibodies declines rapidly in the newly hatched\nchick [13]. Our PRNT results are totally consistent with\nthese known observations and they demonstrate that\nWNV, USUV and SINV (at least), or closely related viruses,\nmust have circulated on the farm in the previous year. The\ndecline in antibody prevalence during the first few weeks\nafter hatching is also consistent with the idea that WNV is\nunlikely to have been circulating significantly during the\nfirst three or four months of the year, i.e. late winter and\nearly spring. The detection of a significant increase in the\nnumbers of serologically positive chickens from July\nonwards can probably be explained most appropriately as\ndue to this being the time immediately after the arrival of\nmigratory birds from Africa, Europe and the Middle East\nand also being the warmest time of the year when mosqui-\ntoes would be relatively active and therefore capable of\ntransmitting arboviruses, even in England. Some chickens\nseroconverted even though they had been kept indoors\nfor most of their lives. However, the ventilation system for\nthe building in which they were housed is positive and\nnot filtered inwards, moreover, adjoining rooms con-\ntained wild birds, inferring that the chickens could have\nIndirect immunofluorescence microscopy performed on chicken sera with a n utralization titre of 1\/80 (diluted 1:1000 in PBS) n W st Nile virus nf cted Vero c lls (Bar 50\u03bcm)Figure 3\nIndirect immunofluorescence microscopy performed on \nchicken sera with a neutralization titre of 1\/80 (diluted \n1:1000 in PBS) on West Nile virus infected Vero cells (Bar \n50\u03bcm).Page 4 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nVirology Journal 2006, 3:71 http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/3\/1\/71been exposed to aerosols containing virus. In addition to\nvirus transmission by blood transfusion and organ trans-\nplantation, there is now compelling evidence that arbovi-\nruses such as WNV may be transmitted between\nvertebrates using a variety of mechanisms other than\ndirect transmission by arthropods. These include the aer-\nosol and faecal\/oral routes, transmission via direct physi-\ncal contact or maternal milk, and through contaminated\nwater. It is also clear that WNV can persist in vertebrate\nhosts for months if not years without inducing obvious\nclinical symptoms [5,14-21]. It seems likely that these\nproperties provide WNV with the tools to circulate silently\nin many regions of the world and this may explain our\nobservations of seroconversion in sentinel chickens in the\nUK. It is also important to emphasize that similar studies\nusing sera from sequentially bled sentinel chickens in\nItaly, known to circulate WNV but with no associated dis-\nease, have been carried out and will report similar find-\nings to those reported herein (manuscript submitted for\npublication).\nOur observations support and extend the findings of oth-\ners that although mosquitoes are important vectors in dis-\nease transmission, other modes of transmission and\npersistence may also be important in the transmission\nand circulation of WNV and other arboviruses. We now\nneed to understand why in most cases, WNV can disperse\nvery successfully without causing overt disease but in\nother situations it can cause significant epidemic out-\nbreaks involving substantial morbidity and mortality.\nMaterials and methods\nSentinel chickens\nThree groups of chickens were hatched in early April, mid\nMay and mid June 2004 respectively on a farm in Cam-\nbridgeshire and reared outdoors. Individual sera were col-\nlected from birds at various ages from 4 days to 20 weeks.\nThe last samples (20 weeks) were collected at the end of\nOctober 2004, when outdoor temperatures had dropped\nsufficiently to reduce insect-biting activity in the UK to rel-\natively low levels. Groups of these animals were moni-\ntored periodically for the presence, in the sera, of\nneutralizing antibodies to WNV, USUV and SINV. For\nobvious technical reasons, only very small quantities of\nserum were obtainable from the very young chicks, limit-\ning the scope of their investigation. Another group of\nchickens was hatched and reared indoors, and serum sam-\nples collected at 9 weeks of age.\nPlaque reduction neutralization tests\nThese tests were carried out as described previously [3]\nand are based on the WHO standard method. Briefly, each\nheat-inactivated (56\u00b0C for 30 minutes) serum sample was\ndiluted serially in twofold stages. These were mixed in\nequal volume with 50 plaque-forming units of either\nWNV-Is, WNV-DAK, USUV or SINV. The mixtures were\nincubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Each mixture was then placed\non a monolayer of SW13 cells in 24-well Petri-plates and\nincubated for 60 mins at room temperature. 1 ml of over-\nlay medium (RPMI-1640 with Hepes buffer, 1% foetal\nbovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin and 1% SeaPlaque\nAgarose) was added to each well and allowed to set at\nroom temperature, then the plates were incubated at\n37\u00b0C until plaques were identifiable in control wells. The\nmonolayers were fixed in 10% formol-saline and stained\nwith 0.1% naphthalene black stain. Serum neutralization\ntitres were estimated as the highest dilution causing at\nleast 50% reduction of plaque numbers. Titres less than 1\/\n10 were considered to be negative.\nPurification of WNV\nThe supernatant medium collected from 10 \u00d7 175 cm2\nplastic tissue culture bottles was clarified by centrifugation\nat 5000 g for 30 mins and the virus was then precipitated\nfrom this clarified medium by the addition of 7% polyeth-\nylene glycol and 0.4 M NaCl. After stirring overnight at\n4\u00b0C, the virus was sedimented by centrifugation at 5000 g\nfor 1 hour. The pellets were resuspended in PBS and lay-\nered onto 15\u201360% (w\/w) sucrose gradients prepared in\nTris-EDTA buffer pH7.4. The gradients were spun at\n90,000 g for 3 hours and the tube was then fractionated by\nupward displacement. Each fraction was tested for the\npresence of viral antigens by western blotting (see below).\nThe sample in the 60% sucrose fraction produced a very\ndistinct band of viral envelope (E) protein as deduced\nusing a monoclonal antibody known to bind to WNV-E\nprotein (see Results).\nWestern blotting\nGradient-purified West Nile virus antigen and sera\n(diluted 1\/100) from sentinel chickens were used for the\nanalysis. The virus proteins were separated by10% poly-\nacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions\nuntil the dye front had run off the bottom of the gel. A\nBiorad semi-dry blotter was used to transfer the protein\nbands from the gel onto the Hybond-P PVDF transfer\nmembrane. After transfer the membrane was blocked in\n5% milk powder (in TBS and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 hour\nat room temperature. The blot was then cut into identical\nstrips (approximately 6 mm wide) which were individu-\nally treated with a chicken serum diluted 1\/100 to test for\nantibodies to WNV. The strips were washed in TBS\/Tween\n20 three times before addition of 1:20,000 dilution of\nRabbit anti Chicken conjugated with alkaline phos-\nphatase (Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature. The\nstrips were washed three times in TBS\/Tween 20 then once\nin 0.1 M Tris pH9.6 before addition of the BCIP\/NBT liq-\nuid substrate system (Sigma).Page 5 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nVirology Journal 2006, 3:71 http:\/\/www.virologyj.com\/content\/3\/1\/71Publish with BioMed Central   and  every \nscientist can read your work free of charge\n\"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for \ndisseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\"\nSir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK\nYour research papers will be:\navailable free of charge to the entire biomedical community\npeer reviewed and published immediately upon acceptance\ncited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central \nyours \u2014 you keep the copyright\nSubmit your manuscript here:\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/info\/publishing_adv.asp\nBioMedcentral\nIndirect immunofluorescence microscopy\nThis was performed on chicken sera (diluted 1:100 or\n1:1000 in PBS). Each diluted serum was added to acetone-\nfixed WNV-infected Vero cells on glass coverslips. After\nincubation for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C the cells were washed in\nwarm PBS for 30 minutes. Rabbit anti-chicken FITC\n(Sigma) diluted to 1:400 was then added and after incu-\nbation for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, the coverslips were washed in\nwarm PBS and water before mounting in DABCO\/Glyc-\nerol\/PBS pH8.6, on microscope slides. Each monolayer\nwas examined for virus-specific immunofluorescence\nunder a UV light microscope.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAB carried out all the immunoassays and data processing\nand helped draft the manuscript, AD designed, set up and\ncarried out the sentinel study, EAG conceived and co-ordi-\nnated the study, supervised the research and drafted the\nmanuscript.
