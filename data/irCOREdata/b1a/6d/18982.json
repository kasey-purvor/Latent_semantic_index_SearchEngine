It involves care of women with medical\ncomplications of pregnancy which may be specific to or\npredate the pregnancy [1]. Approximately half of complex\npregnancies are related to an abnormal fetal or obstetric\nfactor, whereas medical diseases constitute the remainder\nof this high risk obstetric population. Scientific develop-\nments in internal or general medicine have led to newer\ndiagnostic and therapeutic strategies to manage medical\ndiseases. The physiological changes during pregnancy can\naffect not only the clinical presentation of a medical prob-\nlem but may give rise to difficulties in diagnosing and\nmanaging these problems. In order to provide the best\npossible quality of care to women with complicated preg-\nnancies obstetricians dealing with the high risk obstetric\ncases should have evidence based knowledge on the diag-\nnostic, therapeutic and prognostic aspects of maternal\nmedicine.\nRecently there has been a proliferation of systematic\nreviews as one of the key tools for evidence-based medi-\ncine [2]. As maternal medicine covers the issues related to\npregnancy as well as general medicine, research evidence\nis scattered in the literature making it difficult to access\ninformation for clinical decision making. Systematic\nreviews provide a way forward as individual pieces of\nresearch can be collected within literature reviews and if\nappropriate subjected to meta-analysis [3]. Good method-\nological quality is essential for these reviews to have valid\ninferences and to produce usable evidence summaries to\nguide the obstetric management [4]. This study examines\nthe methodological features of recently published system-\natic reviews in maternal medicine and specifically com-\npares Cochrane to non-Cochrane reviews.\nMethods\nTo determine the quality of current systematic reviews in\nmaternal medicine, we developed a priori protocol based\non recommended methods [2,5-7].\nA computerised search of publicly available databases was\nconducted. Ovid Medline (1996 to date), Embase (1996\nto date), Database of Reviews of Effectiveness and\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched\nfor relevant reviews published between 2001 and 2006.\nKey word combinations like Pregnan$, Matern$, Gesta-\ntion$, Obstetric$, Complication$, Systematic review$ and\nMeta analys$ were used for the search strategy in addition\nto word variants, subject headings and free text. The $ sign\nis a truncator used to capture any word that begin with the\nletters in front of the $ sign in the search terms used. Addi-\ntionally common and specific medical problems related\nto pregnancy were searched using key words describing\nnames of the disease such as Pre eclampsia, Hypertension,\nDiabetes, Cholestasis, Anaemia, Thrombocytopaenia,\nThrombophilia, and Thromboembolism. Hand search of\nreference lists was conducted of all relevant articles to\nidentify any missing reviews. The searches were limited to\nreviews between 2001 and 2006 due to increasing devel-\nopments in the field of maternal medicine in recent years.\nInclusion criteria required a minimum of two publicly\navailable databases searched for a medical condition spe-\ncific to or predating pregnancy and maternal factor as the\nprimary outcome. We searched without language restric-\ntions. All the reviews with fetal or neonatal factor as the\nprimary outcome were excluded.\nTwo reviewers independently extracted and assessed the\ndata according to a checklist formulated as part of our pro-\ntocol (Table 1). The methodological quality of each\nreview was assessed by focussing on framing of the ques-\ntion, literature search and review methods scrutinising\nmethods of literature search and data synthesis. The items\nassessed internal validity and explicitness of reporting,\nboth of which are important issues in quality of reviews.\nDifferences between reviewers were resolved by discus-\nsion. We computed rates of compliance with the items in\nour checklist and compared Cochrane and non-Cochrane\nreviews. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals\nwere computed. All statistical analysis was performed\nusing Stata 8.0 statistical package.\nResults\nThe initial literature search resulted in 2864 citations. Of\nthese 68 reviews [8-75] fulfilled the inclusion criteria and\nwere selected for detailed study (Fig 1). A total of 39\n(57%) Cochrane reviews [8-46] and 29 (43%) non\nCochrane reviews [47-75] were included. Most of the\nreviews assessed therapeutic interventions (50\/68, 74%),\nand the rest were reviews on prognosis (12\/68, 17%) and\ndiagnosis (6\/68, 9%). The range of clinical topics dealt\nwith by the reviews is shown in Fig 2.\nOverall quality of the existing systematic reviews was var-\niable (Fig 3). Majority of the reviews (62\/68, 91%) speci-\nfied the question and 54\/68 (79%) had a focussed\nquestion with clearly defined population and outcome\nmeasures. A large population of the reviews (64\/68, 94%)\nhad a detailed search description including databases\nsearched and key words used. Almost half of the reviews\n(32\/68, 47%) attempted to include unpublished data.\nHowever only 11\/68 (16%) assessed the risk of missing\nstudies quantitatively and 17\/68 (25%) searched without\nlanguage restriction. Almost all the reviews had good tab-\nulation of results and characteristics of included studies\n(65\/68, 96%).Page 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medicine 2007, 5:10 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/5\/10The quality of Cochrane and non Cochrane reviews is\ngiven in Fig 3. Cochrane reviews [8-46] had specified the\nquestions more often than non Cochrane reviews [47-\n51,53-55,58-60,62-71,73-75] (OR 20.3, 95% CI 1.1\u2013\n381.3, p = 0.04) and were also framed narrowly focussed\nquestions specifying the population, interventions and\ncomparisons, outcome of the study and the study design\n(OR 30.9, 95% CI 3.7- 256.2, p = 0.001). Cochrane\nreviews attempted more often to include unpublished\ndata in literature search (OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.9\u201316.4, p =\n0.002). Twelve out of 29 non-Cochrane reviews\n[48,50,53-55,64-66,68-71] performed a meta-analysis,\nbut there was good awareness of where this technique was\nvaluable and where it was not applicable. Meta analysis\ntechnique (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.3\u201310.8, p = 0.02) and\nassessment for heterogeneity (OR 38.1, 95%CI 2.1, 688.2,\np = 0.01) was found to be employed significantly more\noften by Cochrane reviews.\nDiscussion\nOur study showed that the Cochrane reviews [8-46] were\nof consistently high methodological quality and had a\ngreater level of assessment for quality of included studies.\nThey always did a meta-analysis [9,12,17,19-25,27-40,44-\n46] where applicable. This is reassuring for clinicians who\nrely on them for decision-making.

However this issue has been addressed by increase\nin the web publishing of additional material in the elec-\ntronic format by many journals in recent years.\nThis work has highlighted that literature searches in\nreviews are currently generally poor. A search that is not\nthorough risks giving biased inferences. We identified\nconsiderable room for improvement in certain methodo-\nlogical features of non Cochrane reviews. However all the\nselected reviews were similar in searches without language\nrestriction and assessment for risk of missing studies.\nInterestingly use of reference list of the selected papers to\nidentify any other eligible studies for inclusion in the\nreview was found to be more frequent in non Cochrane\nreviews (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1\u20130.7, p < 0.007). This could\nbe a result of the generic search strategy employed by\nCochrane reviews with unclear mention of the use of ref-\nerence lists in individual reviews. Cochrane reviews were\nfound more likely to attempt to include unpublished data\ncompared to non Cochrane reviews (OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.9\u2013\n16.4, p < 0.002). This attempt to avoid publication bias is\nsignificant as the odds of publication are higher if the\nresults are found to be significant compared to studies\nwith non-significant results.[76]\nThis study identified areas of maternal medicine that lack\ngood quality systematic reviews. Majority of the reviews\nwere on hypertensive disorders [8,10,11,17,19-23,31-\n34,37,48,53,55,58,64,65,69,70], psychiatry\n[15,27,43,47,50-52,56,57,59,61,74,75], or thromboem-\nbolism [26,42,62-66,68]. Even among these commonly\naddressed areas, a very narrow spectrum of diseases was\ncovered. For example reviews in psychiatry were solely\nfocussed on depression during pregnancy and reviews in\nhypertension focussed mainly on pre eclampsia.

We found very few\nreviews on diabetes mellitus [12,39,49,73] and chronic\nhypertension and none on thyroid disorders.\nWith advancement in neonatology and paediatric medi-\ncine, more and more women with congenital problems\nsuch as congenital heart disease and inherited metabolic\ndiseases are reaching child bearing age and considering\npregnancy. There is an urgent need to have some cumula-\ntive evidence on management of this high risk group in\nthe best possible way.\nThis study has some potential limitations. With our strict\ncriteria to include reviews conducted with two publicly\navailable databases, it is possible that some of the good\nquality reviews in maternal medicine using single data-\nbase are missed. Another limitation relates to maternal\noutcome as the main focus of our study. We excluded all\nthose reviews in which association between maternal dis-\nease and perinatal outcome was assessed. Keeping in\nmind the primary goal of an obstetrician being directed\ntowards achieving a healthy and safe outcome for both\nmother and fetus, good quality evidenced based informa-\ntion on medical problems during pregnancy can only be\nachieved by reviewing methodological features of all\naspects of maternal medicine irrespective of the endpoint.\nDue to the absence of blinding of the reviewers to the\nsource of the review it is difficult to completely rule out\nany resultant bias.\nConclusion\nEvidence based healthcare continues to make important\ncontributions to the well being of pregnant women. This\nstudy has identified areas in maternal medicine that lack\ngood quality systematic reviews. Overall quality of the\nexisting systematic reviews was variable, with Cochrane\nreviews better than other reviews. To achieve better under-\nstanding and provide high quality obstetric care for preg-\nnant women with medical problems, it is important to\nensure that systematic reviews in maternal medicine are\nconducted to cover wider spectrum of diseases, and are\nreported at the highest possible quality.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nFunding\nNone\nAuthors' contributions\nLS conducted the search, extracted data and drafted the\ninitial version. SJ performed data extraction. ST performed\nstatistical analysis. ST, MK and KSK drafted and approved\nthe final version.\nReferences\n1.
