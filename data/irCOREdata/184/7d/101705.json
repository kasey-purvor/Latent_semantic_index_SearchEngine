In doing so it highlights the point that the links \nbetween a site's attributes and the tourists themselves are essential to understanding \ntourists\u2019 motivations to visit heritage places. The sample was composed of English \nspeaking international tourists leaving Israel through Ben-Gurion airport, who were \nsampled quasi-randomly. The research was implemented by the use of structured \nquestionnaires using face-to-face interviews. Responses were grouped using an \ninterpretability approach to exploratory factor analysis, and the results indicate that \nthe reasons for visiting can be classified into three. These groups have been labeled \n\u2018heritage experience\u2019, \u2018learning experience\u2019 and \u2018recreational experience\u2019, and are \nlinked to the tourists\u2019 perception of the site in relation to their own heritage and their \nwillingness to be exposed to an emotional experience. The results lead to a better \nunderstanding of reasons for visiting heritage places, and provide further insight into \nheritage tourism in general. The findings are also relevant to the operational \nmanagement of spaces presenting history-related artifacts as well as to the marketing \nof these sites. \n \n \nKey words: heritage, heritage space, motivation. \n 3\nINTRODUCTION: THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING TOURISTS' \nMOTIVATION \n \nThe general interest in the reasons why human beings are involved in certain \nactivities has not passed tourism research by (Parrinello, 1993). Discovering why \ntourists do certain thing is relevant for (at least) two interrelated reasons: the \nmanagement of tourism; academic investigation (Haukeland, 1992; Yuan & \nMcDonald, 1990). A number of studies have established relationships between \nvarious aspects of behavior relevant to tourism management as well as its theoretical \nunderstanding, related to motivation for tourist\u2019s activities. Examples of such \nbehavior are the choice of destination and mode of travel (Pearce & Catabiano, 1983), \nexpectations (Rekom, 1994) and information sources used (Kim et al., 1996). Other \nresearch, emphasizing marketing implications, points out the relationship between an \nindividual\u2019s motivation and their socio- demographic characteristics. Such \ninformation is helpful for various aspects of marketing such as advertising (Decrop, \n1999; Hanqin, 1999).  \n \nUnderstanding motivations is also seen as an important aspect of the academic \ninvestigation of tourism. From the early days of tourism research, scholars have \nlooked at the reasons for people being involved in tourist activities (Todd, 1999). \nCohen (1974), for example, related reasons for traveling and the purpose of the trip, \nwhile trying to answer the question \u2018who is a tourist?\u2019. The relative importance of the \nconcept of motivation for tourism research and management can also be illustrated by \nthe fact that researchers, when attempting to provide a working definition for \u2018tourist\u2019 \nor \u2018tourism\u2019, commonly relate to the motives for the travel (Leiper, 1979). \n 4\n \nMotivations have also been used to identify subgroups of tourism, and to \ndistinguish between different groups of tourists. For example, Herold et al. (2001) \ntried to conceptualize romance and sex tourism with reference to motivating factors \nwhile Clift and Forrest (1999) investigated the motivations of gay men with respect to  \ntourist activities. Lang and O\u2019Leary (1997) developed a typology of the nature of  \ntravelers based on motivation, and Wight (1996) refers to motivation in her attempt to  \ndistinguish eco-tourists from other types. The need to \u2018know\u2019 tourists and their \nmotivations has also been emphasized with respect to managing attractions presenting \nheritage. In this context, aspects such as interpretation (Moscardo, 1996), visitor \nsatisfaction (Laws, 1998), marketing (Nuryanti, 1996) and visitation patterns \n(Prideaux & Kininniont, 1999) have been investigated. \n \n      This study aims further to investigate the reasons why people visit a site where  \nhistoric artifacts are located. It is hoped that such an investigation will contribute to  \nthe theoretical understanding of heritage tourism by highlighting whether in order to \nunderlined it as a social phenomenon, there is a need to emphasize the link between \nthe tourists and the space visited. It will also investigate whether heritage tourism is \nbehavior motivated by the search for education and knowledge or whether there is a \nsearch for emotional experience that has not yet been identified. Such new \nunderstanding of tourists' motivation to visit heritage places will have implications for \nthe practical management of such places as well. Identifying that different tourists \nvisit heritage site for different reasons may lead to the provision of different services \nfor visitors. It may also contribute to more direct marketing, where groups of \nconsumers are approached based on their own reasons for visiting the site. \n 5\nThe paper starts with a literature review in which the study of motivation in the \ncontext of tourism is briefly discussed. The link between the study of motivation and \nheritage tourism is then presented, and the research objective clarified. Following this, \nthe methodological framework is set out. Finally, the findings are given, and the \nconclusion and the discussion are presented. \n \n \nTHEORETICAL FRAMEWORK \n \nMotivation in tourism research \n \nAlthough it is common to refer to \u2018tourist motivation\u2019 (Ryan & Kinder, 2000; \nWight, 1996), understanding the concept of \u2018motivation\u2019 as explored in the literature \nhas come under criticism (Ryan & Glendon, 1998; Todd, 1999). Pizam et al. (1979), \nfor example, suggest that there is some confusion between motivation and objective. \nThe study of motivation is regarded by some to be the 'thorn in the side\u2019 of tourism \nresearch (McCabe, 2000:211). Currently the investigation as to \u2018why do tourists \ntravel?\u2019 is even more complex as it is difficult to distinguish between notions of \nrecreation, leisure and work (Poria et al., 2003a). \n \nThe interdisciplinary nature of tourism gives the researcher the freedom to \nchoose different theoretical backgrounds with which to clarify reasons for travel \n(Goeldner et al., 2000). There have already been a few attempts to establish a theory \nas to why people travel. It is argued here that, although these attempts are important \nand useful, what they present are frameworks and classifications of reasons rather \n 6\nthan an actual theory. Dann (1977) suggested focusing on the existence of \u2018anomie\u2019 or \n\u2018ego-enhancement\u2019 as a \u2018push factor\u2019 for a better understanding of tourism, which he \nsaw as \u2018conducive to the creation of a fantasy world\u2019 (Dann, 1977:184). Crompton \n(1979) classified motivation (in the context of pleasure vacations) according to push \nand pull factors. Push factors are those that predispose the person to travel, while pull \nfactors are those that attract the potential traveler to a specific destination. This same  \nclassification has been used by several others (e.g. Yuan & McDonald, 1990). \n \nIso-Ahola (1982) looked at motivation in terms of escape-seeking (again \nmainly in the context of pleasure tourism). Pearce (1996) has also provided a \ntheoretical framework for the understanding of motivation, suggesting a five-fold \nhierarchical system, distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Gnoth \n(1997:283) relied on \u2018the behaviorist notion of drive reduction and the cognitive \nconstruction of attitudes and values\u2019 to develop a theoretical background by \nemphasizing the holidaymaker\u2019s perspective. \n \nAlthough there is now a body of research centered on tourists\u2019 motivation, \nDann\u2019s suggestion from 1981 may still be relevant. Basically, he questioned whether \nresearchers were investigating the same concept when exploring tourism motivation. \nAlthough 15 years have passed since Jafari originally argued that \u2018there is already a \nwide range of literature dealing with such motivational propositions, but no common \nunderstanding has emerged\u2019 (1987:152), the point is still valid. This reflects a notion \nthat can be found even in disciplines such as psychology on which tourism \nresearchers often rely for their theoretical background (Iso-Ahola, 1989). \n \n 7\nHeritage tourism and motivation research \n \nBefore exploring reasons for visiting heritage spaces, two interlinked critical \nissues need to be raised, namely: the difference between tourism in historic places and  \nheritage tourism, and the fact that the study of motivation is commonly centered on \nnotions of leisure, recreation and pleasure.  \n \nHeritage tourism is commonly regarded as activity by tourists in a space where \nhistoric artifacts are presented (Garrod & Fyall, 2001). By contrast it is argued in this \npaper that heritage tourism should be understood based on the relationship between \nthe individual and the heritage presented and, more specifically, based on the tourists\u2019 \nperception of the site as part of their own heritage (Poria, 200la, 2001b; Poria et al., \n200la, 200lb, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c). This argument lies at the heart of this research, as \nperceptions of a site rather than their objective classification may be highly relevant \nfor better understanding reasons for visiting places where historic artifacts are \npresented. \n \nThe second issue raised here by the authors is that studies around the concept \nof tourist motivation, as well as studies that apply the various theoretical frameworks, \nare concerned mainly with travel classified as leisure or pleasure related. For example, \nHaukeland (1992) studied holiday travel, while Aroch (1985), who looked at \nmotivation in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, considered only leisure \nand recreational travel. Likewise Gnoth (1997), in a theoretical paper about the link \nbetween expectation and motivation, decided to emphasize the perspective of \nholidaymakers. In his classification of push and pull factors (which can be useful for \n 8\nour understanding of heritage tourism), Dann (1977:184) relied on the concept of \n\u2018fantasy world\u2019, as noted earlier. Such understanding and theoretical framework may \nnot apply to reasons for visiting heritage spaces, as those places may not be perceived \nby visitors as solely \u2018recreational\u2019 or \u2018pleasure\u2019 sites.  \n \nThere is already research concerning the reasons driving people to visit places \nwhere historic artifacts are presented. However, such research often approaches \n\u2018heritage tourism\u2019 as part of \u2018cultural tourism\u2019 and relies on the leisure and recreation \nliterature. Such research which perceives heritage tourism to be based on the presence \nof tourists in historic places or places where cultural artifacts are presented, it is \nargued, does not clarify the nature of the phenomenon (Poria, et al, 2003a, 2003b, \n2003c). It is argued that to understand the presence of people in places where, for \nexample, religious artifacts are presented, there is a need to explore elements which \nare different from those used in the tourism literature. One example is work presented \nby Davies and Prentice (1995), who tried to provide a theoretical background for \nunderstanding why people do not visit museums. They regarded a visit to a museum \nas a leisure activity, seeing museums as \u2018heritage attractions\u2019. Another example is that \ngiven by Kerstetter et al. (2001), who suggested the segmentation of tourists visiting \nheritage sites by their interest in history per se.  \n \nPrentice et al., clustered visitors to an industrial heritage attraction based on \nliterature under the title \u2018recreational\u2019 (1998:3). This could be appropriate for an  \nindustrial heritage park which, apart from being classified as \u2018heritage\u2019, may have  \nnothing to offer visitors which was linked to their heritage. This may explain why, in \ntheir classification of those visiting the site, the term heritage is not mentioned. \n 9\nVerbeke and Rekon (1996), in their research about the role of museums, identified \nmotivations such as \u2018to escape from daily routine\u2019 and \u2018to be in the open air\u2019, but such \nmotivations have nothing to do with the heritage that lies at the heart of the site. \nAnother example of this ambiguous mix is given by Zeppel and Hall (1991, 1992) \nwho decided to combine \u2018arts and heritage tourism\u2019 and to consider them \u2018as a subset \nof cultural tourism\u2019 (1992:47). This combination may lead to \u2018cultural motivations\u2019 \n(p.49) or \u2018learning\u2019 (p.53) as a motivation in relation to heritage tourism. Another \nexample, which highlights this issue, is that reported by Zhou et al., (1998) who \nproposed that one of the main reasons for the Chinese to visit heritage sites is their \nfame and popularity with others. \n \nPrentice (l993a), in research dealing with heritage consumers in the context of \nthe leisure market, suggested six motivations: pleasure of viewing, education, \ninformation, relaxation, entertainment and exercise. It is argued here that these may  \nbe applicable to any form of cultural tourism and are not necessarily linked to the \nheritage presented, which is arguably central to a heritage site. Moscardo (1996), \nwhile clarifying the role of interpretation in the context of the management of heritage  \nsites, emphasized two main motivations: educational and entertainment \/ social. \nHowever, it was again felt that the heritage site was perceived mainly as \u2018another \nmuseum\u2019 or \u2018cultural attraction\u2019 rather than \u2018someone\u2019s heritage\u2019. The above \ntheoretical background could be helpful to our understanding of a visit, for example, \nto an art gallery, which some would classify as a heritage attraction (Prentice, 1993b).  \nHowever, it is doubtful if it would be useful for understanding visitation patterns of \nJews to Nazi-related spaces or of New Yorkers to the memorial site that will be built \nfor those who were killed in the attack on the Twin Towers in New York. The \n 10\ninterpretation of the reason for travel based on only such concepts as leisure and \nrecreation may not be relevant for tourists visiting a site they perceive to be part of \ntheir own heritage. \n \nThe research problem and its purpose \n \nTo summarize, it seems that the two most common reasons to visit a heritage \nsite reported in the literature are education (i.e. the tourists\u2019 willingness to learn) and \nentertainment (i.e. the tourists\u2019 desire to be entertained). But other reasons, linked to \nthe attributes of the artifacts presented being related to someone\u2019s heritage may also \nplay a part. The present research challenges the current approach, not by denying \nthese two most common reasons, but by adding another, namely the desire of tourists \nto be exposed to their own heritage and thus to be involved in a personal \u2018heritage \nexperience\u2019. \n \nResearch in environmental psychology, which explores the link between the \nindividual and the environment, supports the notion that the meaning attached to a \nspace is closely linked to one\u2019s experience (Carling, 1988; Scott & Canter, 1997). In \nheritage tourism an alternative view which challenges the traditional way heritage \ntourism has been understood, has emerged. In this literature it is argued that the \ntourists\u2019 perceptions of a site and their activities relative to it are important for our \nunderstanding of their behavior (Poria, 200la, 2001b; Poria et al., 200la, 200lb).   \n \nBased on this viewpoint it is argued that viewing heritage tourism as cultural \ntourism, as suggested by Nuryanti (1996) who approached built heritage sites as \u2018the \n 11\nheart of cultural tourism\u2019 (p.249), is too simplistic. The \u2018cultural tourism\u2019 label hints \nat activity motivated by curiosity and educational reasons, and ignores the core of \nsuch sites- the heritage itself that is presented. This issue is highlighted by the \nquestion raised by Swarbrooke (1994): \u2018heritage - education or entertainment?\u2019 \n(p.225). It is argued that this question may conceal what lies at the heart of this \nphenomenon: the heritage presented. The importance of such heritage may also be \nreflected in the reasons for visiting. At this stage it should be emphasized that the aim \nof this research was not to answer the overall question \u2018why do tourists visit places \npresenting heritage?\u2019 but to explore whether reasons for such visits are grouped in a \ncertain way which reflects the link between the individual and the object presented. It \nis suggested that an answer to this question could be helpful for the understanding and \nmanagement of heritage tourism as a social phenomenon.  \n \nIn this research it was hypothesized that regarding heritage tourism  \nas simply \u2018tourists visiting heritage places\u2019 would be reflected by a diversity in the  \ntourists\u2019 reasons for visiting such sites. Based on the results it was interesting to  \nsee whether a structure appeared in which differences could be found between:  \n1) those reasons already mentioned in the literature in relation to heritage attractions  \nand 2) reasons associated with the actual heritage presented. If found, such differences  \nwould begin to challenge the questions: are tourists seeking an educational or \nentertaining experience, or is there something else going on that has yet to be \ndiscovered?. If those differences could be linked to the tourists\u2019 perception of the site \nas part of their own heritage it would further support the notion that heritage tourism \nshould be investigated based on the links between the site and the tourists. Such an \nunderstanding could provide knowledge useful for improving a variety of aspects of  \n 12\nthe management of attractions presenting heritage, including marketing, interpretation  \nand operations. The results may also make a theoretical contribution by suggesting \nthat the understanding of certain forms of tourist behavior should be based not only on \nresearch from leisure and recreation as is commonly the case, but should also consider \nareas such as religion, where a sense of commitment and obligation are common \nfactors affecting behavior. The research could also suggest that understanding \ntourists\u2019 behavior should not be based only on the attributes of the site or the \ncharacteristics of the tourists but also on the link between the two. \n \nMETHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK \n \nThe sites \n \nTo provide a better clarification of the research problem it was decided to \ninvestigate two different sites: the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem; Massada in the south of \nIsrael. It was thought that investigating two sites, substantially different in their \nattributes, would support possible generalization of the findings.   \n  \nThe Wailing Wall is considered to be the most important religious site for \nJews, with historic meaning arising from the fact that it is believed to be part of the \noriginal Temple. It is also associated with Israel\u2019s victory in the Six-Day War, which \nfor Zionists symbolizes the existence of an independent Jewish state. The Wailing \nWall also relates to Christianity on religious grounds, as Jesus stood there and \nprophesized the downfall of the Temple (Schiller, 1992; Eder and O\u2019Sullivan, 1989). \n \n 13\nAs a heritage site the Wailing Wall has a number of key characteristics \nspecifically relevant to this research. First, it was recognized that choosing the \nWailing Wall would bring into play religious-related motivation associated with the \nBible, as well as that associated with the history of the state of Israel. Clearly this is \nlikely to have an effect on the motivations of many of those who visit the site. \nHowever, it was also felt that it would not limit the diversity of motivation among the \nvisitors due to its location and it being a \u2018must see\u2019 site for a wide range of visitors. \nSecondly, apart from viewing the Wailing Wall, there is nothing else to do there \nexcept pray or observe those who pray. There are no other attractions such as \nrestaurants, entertainment facilities or breathtaking scenery. This factor is relevant to \nthe research problem, as it will help clarify our understanding of the reasons for \nvisiting the site. Thirdly (in common with several other heritage attractions), entrance \nis free, and thus a potential barrier (i.e. direct cost) to entering the site is removed. It is \nsuggested that this could result in a variety of visitors who are motivated on different \ngrounds. This notion was supported by an official report of the Israel Ministry of \nTourism, which suggested that the Wailing Wall was the most popular tourist \nattraction in Israel (Israel Ministry of Tourism, 1996, 1997, 1998). \n \nMassada was chosen because its attributes are different from the Wailing \nWall. Massada is a historic site per se, and a site that presents history, which some \nvisitors perceive to be part of their own heritage. However, in contrast to the Wailing \nWall, Massada, apart from presenting historic artifacts provides visitors with a \nspectacular view of the desert, the Dead Sea, and Jordan. The site is famous for its \nrole in the Jewish revolt against the Romans (in AD 70), where it was the last pocket \nof Zealot resistance. The rebels decided not to surrender, but to kill each other so as \n 14\nnot to be enslaved by the Romans and made to follow their religion (Mehling, 1987). \nBecause of this the site has symbolic meaning and is commonly involved in the \npolitical discourse in today\u2019s modern Israel. Unlike the Wailing Wall it is not located \nrelatively close to other sites. Massada lies in the south of Israel, around 3 hours \ndriving time from Tel Aviv, which suggests that visitors will not come to the site \u2018by \naccident\u2019. Also one needs to pay an entrance fee. It is also different from the Wailing \nWall where a visit may take less than five minutes, in that at Massada the actual \nlength of visit is commonly three to four hours.  \n \nIt was felt that these two sites represent two kinds of heritage attractions. The \nWailing Wall is a site which has at its core history which may be linked to different \npeople on different grounds. To some the heritage is perceived as highly linked to \ntheir identity, while for others it is not. Massada is an example of a site that provides \nits visitors with more than a heritage experience only (e.g. the view from the site, a \nvisit to the desert area). Moreover, while the history presented may be perceived \ndifferently by different tourists, is not highly linked to the tourist\u2019s own heritage           \n \n Research implementation \n \nThe research tool was a structured questionnaire implemented through face to \nface interviews. It was decided to interview international tourists after they had \ncompleted their visit to Israel. The interviews were conducted in the main Israeli \nairport while the tourists were waiting for their flights as this provided a diversity of \ntourists essential to answer the research question. The objective of the sampling \nstrategy chosen (a theoretical sample) was not to achieve a representative sample of \n 15\nall international tourists visiting the Wailing Wall and Massada, but to include a \ndiversity of tourists. Such a research strategy which aims at finding diversity rather \nthan representing the population could benefit the generalizations of the findings. The \nfieldwork was planned for a period when there would be maximum diversity of \nvisitors. The population was international tourists leaving Israel through Ben-Gurion \nairport who were able to speak and understand English, and were above 15 years old \n(as at this age cognitive abilities are considered to be stable: Apter et al., 1998). The \nreason for confining the population to international tourists was based on the \nassumption that there is greater diversity among this population than among the local \npopulation (especially in the context of the sites investigated). Interviewing as tourists \ndeparted Israel means that the memories about their visit were relatively fresh.  \n \nEvery Nth' tourist was approached while the tourist were waiting for their \nflight (the interviewees were asked not to approach participants in the duty-free \nshops). The value of N was determined by factors such as the number of interviewers, \nthe number of flights departing in a certain time period, the number of tourists waiting \nfor a flight and the time remaining to flight departure. Before inclusion in the sample, \nthe interviewees were asked to confirm whether or not they were tourists. The \nparticipants were first asked if they were tourists to Israel and if they stayed in Israel \nfor more than 24 hours. Then the tourists were asked if they had had a chance to visit \ndifferent places in Israel. Only those answering in the affirmative were included. The \ninterviews were conducted by five students selected after being interviewed by one of \nthe authors.  \n \n 16\nA feasibility study took place in December 1999, and then at the beginning of \nApril 2000 the pilot study was conducted. The actual study took place between April \nand May 2000 (this was done to avoid religious holidays and a Papal visit which may \nhave had an influence on the diversity of the tourists). Almost 400 (398) interviews \nwere conducted. Around fifteen percent of the respondents asked not to participate in \nthe study, usually mentioning that they were tired or working. The interviews took \nplace at day and night times on weekdays and weekends, usually taking around 20 \nminutes. A small token incentive was given to the interviewees at the end of the \ninterview.  \n \n \nEstablishing the research tool \n \n            A quantitative research approach was applied in this study. To address \nthe research problem it was necessary to investigate the relationship between the \ntourists' perception of a site in relation to their own heritage, and their motivations to \nvisit that site.  After short introduction the participant were asked series of question \nwhich aim to find out if they are international tourists. Then participants were asked \nseries of questions about the site only if they had visited them. The tourists were also \nasked several questions about their perception of the site visited in relation to their \nown heritage. At the end of the interview the tourists were asked several questions \nabout their personal characteristics.  \n \nThe tourists were asked to comment about their level of agreement or \ndisagreement with statements dealing with possible reasons for their visit. They \n 17\nwere asked to answer using a 0 to 6 scale (where 0 represents \u2018I completely disagree\u2019 \nand 6 represents \u2018I completely agree\u2019) and provided with a show-card for illustrating \ntheir answers. This was done to minimize social pressure, as participants were often \nnear their friends\/family\/colleagues during the interview. \n \nThe motivation list was developed in such a way as to emphasize the different \nattributes of the sites as described in different guidebooks, as well as including \ncommon reasons for activities mentioned in the literature dealing with visitation  \npatterns to heritage spaces. The reason for referring to tourist guidebooks was based \non the rationale that their description reflects a variety of interests and as such  \nprovides a diversity of reasons essential for this study. These include: a space to pray, \na site which presents historic artifacts, a site that is located close to other tourist \nattractions, a site in which religious people can be observed while praying, and a site \nthat is related to a person\u2019s own heritage. Reasons not directly linked to the heritage \npresented included: located in an open space, a possible place to have a day out, the \nvisual appearance of the site, the absence of an entrance fee, and, it is a \u2018must see\u2019 site \n(like being in Paris and \u2018having to see\u2019 the Eiffel Tower). \n \n \nThe analysis \n \nThe findings are based on differences among groups. A factor analysis (FA) \ntechnique was also used to explore interrelationships among the responses. In this \nresearch, principal-component analysis was used, because of its attribute as the \u2018first \nstep in FA where it reveals a great deal about probable number and nature of factors\u2019 \n 18\n(Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996:664). Then oblique rotation was carried out because of \nthe assumption that the actual factors are related to each other, while the assumption \nbehind orthogonal rotation is that the factors are not related. \n \nDescription of the sample \n \nThe entire sample consisted of 398 participants, of whom 304 (77.6%) and \n136 (34.2%) had visited the Wailing Wall and Massada respectively during their \npresent visit. Of those who had visited the Wailing Wall, 57.6% were male and 42.4% \nfemale. In Massada 58.8% were male and 41.2% female (the gender distribution for \nthe entire sample was 61.8% male and 38.2% female). This unequal ratio of men to \nwomen could be due to business travelers in the sample, who are more likely to be \nmen than women. The mode age group was 20-29 among the visitors to both Massada \nand the Wailing Wall.  \n \nOf those who visited the Wailing wall 24.7% (75) were Jewish, 64.8% were \nChristians (197) and 8.7% identified themselves as Muslims, Other or No Affiliation. \nIn the context of Massada 19.9 % were Jewish (27), 75% were Christians (102) and \n5.1% (7) identified themselves as Muslim, Other or No Affiliation \n \nFINDINGS \n \nResults \n \n 19\nThe results section is composed of different subsections based on the research \nobjectives. First, the results of the factor analysis are presented both for Massada and \nthe Wailing Wall. Following this the links between the factors and the tourists\u2019 \nperceptions of the heritage sites in relation to their own heritage are presented.  \n \n siteheritageTourist motivations to visit  \n \nIt was essential to this study to name and determine the number of factors \namong the tourists' motivations to visit heritage sites. The number of factors to be \nretained is often regarded as the most essential task in interpreting results (Hammond, \n2000). Different approaches can be used for the extraction of variables. One of the \nmost popular is to extract only as many factors as have Eigen-values greater than or \nequal to one, identified as the Kaiser low (the Kaiser low approach actually specifies \nnot to include variables that have Eigen-values smaller than one). A second method is \nby interpretability, when theory or other data suggest a certain solution. The third \napproach is the use of the Scree plot. The approach chosen in this research was that of \ninterpretability. Based on the theoretical background of this study, it was suggested \nthat there are three groups of reasons: those that are linked to the site being related to \nthe tourist\u2019s own heritage (rarely discussed in the literature), those that are linked to \nthe site as it presents historic artifacts, and a third group not linked to the place being \na heritage\/historic site (already identified in the literature). The meaning of a factor is \ndetermined by the items that are associated with it. In order to decide which \nmotivations are included in each factor it was decided to include those that were \ncorrelated above the 0.4 level (larger than +0.4 and smaller than -0.4 (Fife-Schaw, \n2000; Hammond, 2000). \n 20\n \nIn the context of the Wailing Wall, constructing an inter-variable correlation \ncoefficient matrix among the reasons for visiting revealed a relatively large number of \nPearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between many of the identified reasons. Among \nthese, some relatively highly correlated factors were found. Another aspect worth \nmentioning at this stage is the fact that some of the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients \nwere negative. This means that, just as the tourists are motivated to visit the site by \ncertain reasons, they weree made less motivated by other reasons. This kind of \nrelationship suggests that if latent traits are found they may be associated with other \ntraits, both positively and negatively. The actual loading and the factor names are \npresented in the Table 1. \n \n \nBased on the above table, it is suggested that there is a very clear distinction \nbetween the nature of the three constructs. The first component embodied reasons \nlinked to the tourists\u2019 perception of the site as part of their own heritage. The second \ngroup of reasons has nothing to do with the content presented at the site, and is linked \nto the site as a recreational place. The third group of reasons is related to the attributes \nof the site as an historic place in general. Another way to distinguish between these \nthree groups is that the first factor is commonly linked to the tourists\u2019 emotional \ninvolvement \u2018with the heritage presented\u2019 and the third relates to the tourists\u2019 \nwillingness to learn. The second group of reasons has nothing to do with the \ntourists\u2019 involvement with the site. This division suggests that the reasons to visit \ncould be divided into those reasons which are linked to the heart \u2013 the emotional \nexperience - linked to the brain \u2013 the intention to learn \u2013, and not linked with the core \nof the site \u2013 the material subject matter presented.     \nTable 1 here \n 21\n \nIt can be seen that some of the reasons load on two components. For example, \nthe reason \u2018Because you felt you should visit the site\u2019 is loaded above 0.4 on the \nlearning component and the emotional component. This means that those who want to \nhave a \u2018heritage experience\u2019 as well as those looking for a \u2018historic cultural \nexperience\u2019, were motivated to visit because they perceive the visit to be important \n(although this perceived importance may spring from different reasons). Another \ninteresting finding is that the item \u2018It is a world-famous site that you had to see once \nin your life\u2019 is associated positively with the tourists\u2019 motivation to learn, but \nnegatively with the tourists\u2019 willingness to be involved in a heritage experience. This \nmeans that, as these tourists were more motivated to visit the site because it is world-\nfamous, they were less motivated to visit in order to be involved in a heritage \nexperience. \n \n          Table 2 presents the reasons in the context of Massada. The results presented \nfurther support the thought that three factors are at the core of the understanding of \ntourists' motivation to visit heritage sites.   \n \n \nAs can be seen from table 2 the loading of the items on the factors were very \nsimilar to those identified in the context of the Wailing Wall. A difference was found \nin the case of only one reason \u2013 'because it is a world famous site that you had to see \nonce in your life'. In the case of the Wailing Wall this reason was loaded on two \nfactors, positively on the 'learning factor' and negatively on the 'heritage factor'. In the \ncontext of Massada it was highly loaded on the 'learning factor' only. It is suggested \nthat the reason for the difference is that those who perceive the Wailing Wall as part \nTable 2 here \n 22\nof their own heritage do not visit the site because it is a famous tourist attraction and \nthey tend to visit the site more than once. To further clarify this point there is a need \nto explore the link between the tourists' perceptions and their motivations to visit the \nsites.  \n \nand the factors of the heritage presented perceptions ' The link between the tourists\nidentified  \n \nThe tourists were asked a series of five questions to capture their perception of \nthe sites in relation to their own heritage. The participants were presented with \nstatements and a 0 to 6 scale (i.e., 0 means \u2018absolutely not part of my own heritage\u2019 \nand 6 \u2018absolutely part of my heritage\u2019). The distributions of the answers are presented \nin Table 3. \n \n \nAs can be seen from the above table the patterns for the Wailing Wall and for \nMassada are substantially different. In the case of the Wailing Wall there is a bi-polar \ndistribution (i.e. the site is either part of the tourists' own heritage or not), while in the \ncontext of Massada the distribution is positively skewed (i.e. most of the sample \nperceive the site as not belonging to their own heritage).  \n \nTo investigate the relationship between the tourists\u2019 perception of the site in \nrelation to their own heritage and their motivations for the visit several procedures \nwere conducted. As a starting point a reliability test was carried out on the questions \nlisted in Table 3 (the Cronbach Alpha was above 0.8, indicating relatively high \nreliability). Then the tourists' perception of the site was identified as the average of \nTable 3 here \n 23\nthe answers presented in the above table. The reasons for the visit were then grouped \ninto three as was suggested earlier:  Desire to be involved in a heritage experience, \ndesire to learn, and desire to obtain a recreational experience. An average was \ncomputed for each group. Pearson Correlations were then computed (Table 4) \nsuggesting that there is a direct link between the tourists' perception of a site and their \nreasons for visiting (non-parametric tests also conducted revealed the existence of \nrelationships). \n \nThe fact that such high levels of correlation were found suggests that there \nmay be a difference between the tourists based on their perception of the sites and \ntheir motivation to visit the sites. To determine if such differences exist, the tourists \nwere grouped into three: those that perceived the site to be absolutely part of their \nown heritage; those who did not consider the site to be part of their own heritage; and \nthose that were in between. The actual groups were identified based on the average of \nthe questions dealing with the tourists' perception of the site as presented in table 3. \nThose tourists whose answers ranged from 0 to 1.5 (who perceive the site as not part \nof their own heritage), those tourists whose answers ranged between 4.5 and 6 (who \nperceive the site to be part of their own heritage), and those answers who ranged \nbetween 1.5 and 4.5. The actual differences are presented in Table 5 based on One-\nway Anova analysis.  \n \n \nThe data presented suggest first that the average of each motivation is different \nfor each site which is not surprising as the two sites are substantially different from \neach other. It is important for this study that the data presented indicate that \nperceptions of the sites in relation to the heritage are highly linked with some of the \nTable 5 here \n 24\nfactors identified before as reasons to visit the sites. Most important for this study \nwere significant differences found among all the groups at both sites relating to their \nintention to be involved in a heritage experience. At the Wailing Wall a significant \ndifference was found in the motivation to learn between those who did not perceive \nthe site as part of their heritage and other groups. This suggests that those tourists who \ndid not perceive a site as part of their heritage were less motivated to learn about that \nsite, a fact which may be of importance in the context of heritage sites management. \nIn the context of Massada those tourists who perceived the site as part of their own \nheritage were more motivated to learn about the site. These findings may be important \nfor the management of heritage sites as discussed later.  \n \nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION \n \n \nSummary \n \nThis study offers two main contributions for the theoretical investigation of \nheritage tourism. First, results indicate that the reasons for visiting spaces in which \nheritage is presented can be placed into three groups under the headings \u2018heritage \nexperience\u2019, \u2018learning history\u2019 and \u2018recreational experience'.  \n \nThe first group identified contained those reasons that did not relate to the \ncontent of the material presented. This group was made up of reasons such as the \ndesire to have a day out, the cost of entrance, the desire to be entertained, wanting to \nsee a world-famous site, and the desire to relax.  \n 25\n \nThe second and third groups of reasons have some things in common, but are \nseen here as being different from each other overall. One group of reasons is based on \nthe link between the subject matter (i.e. heritage presented) and the tourists\u2019 \nperception of this material in relation to their own heritage. This group expressed \nreasons such as: because it is part of your own heritage, a desire to pray there, desire \nto be emotionally involved, and a sense of obligation. For present purposes, this group \ncould be put under the heading of \u2018a desire to be involved in the heritage experience\u2019.  \n \nThe third group is those with reasons that are linked to the site being a historic \none which people are visiting to observe and learn about. Among these reasons are \ndesire to learn, the physical nature of the site and its historic background. The findings \nalso suggest that some of the reasons can be assigned to more than one factor, \nalthough their loading with each is different. Another interesting pattern was found in \nrelation to \u2018Because it is a world - famous site that you had to see once in your life\u2019. \nThis was positively linked to the \u2018recreational experience\u2019 and \u2018history observation\u2019 \nbut negatively correlated to the \u2018heritage experience\u2019. \n \nThe findings further indicate that differences in perceptions of a site are \nreflected in differences in reasons for visiting a site. This supports the notion that the \nlink between the individual and the site is at the core of the understanding of heritage \ntourism as a social phenomenon. Differences were found among the tourists in those \nthree factors identified. This emphasizes the point that the heritage exhibited at a site \nis at the core of a visit for some tourists, those who seek a heritage experience, the \nheritage tourists.       \n 26\n \nDiscussion \n \nThe findings suggest that site attributes themselves are important to \nunderstanding reasons for visiting a site, but that the perception of these attributes is a \nkey issue. This study suggests that the \u2018past\u2019 presented at a site motivated the tourists \non different grounds. There is a desire to learn about the history, and to take part in a \nrecreational activity. However, to conclude, in contrast to other research, this study \nsuggests that there is also another factor \u2013 the tourists\u2019 desire to be exposed to \nmaterial that is part of their own heritage. \n \nThese results support the argument that behavior depends on perception of a \nsite in relation to personal heritage rather than just site attributes (Poria, 200la, 200lb; \nPoria et al., 2001, 2003a, 2003b). The meaning attached by the tourists lies at the \nheart of this research. This may suggest that any research aimed at explaining \nvisitation patterns or experiences in certain settings should also consider subjective \nnotions and the significance attached to sites (Poria et al., 2001b).  \n \nThis research also reveals that some of reasons for visiting heritage sites are in \ncontrast to notions such as recreation and leisure (e.g. \u2018I felt a sense of obligation to \nvisit the site\u2019). This may show a need to consider more than merely \u2018leisure motives\u2019 \n(see, for example, Ryan and Glendon, 1997) in motivational studies. It is argued that  \nresearch that uses \u2018leisure scales\u2019 and sees \u2018holidaymakers\u2019 simply as those involved  \nin leisure and recreation activities, may not be appropriate to some forms of tourism \nor specific experiences such as heritage tourism. It has been suggested that \n 27\nresearchers may need to look to other disciplines in order to understand certain forms \nof tourism that are not only undertaken in \u2018leisure time\u2019 and are not \u2018recreational\u2019 \n(Poria et al, 2003a, 2003b). One possible example of such an area of research is \nreligious studies, where a sense of obligation is suggested to explain individual \nbehavior. \n \nImplications and future research \n \nAs is the case in all research this study has a number of limitations. Prominent \namong these is the fact that only two sites were studied. It is recognized that a future \nstudy would gain by including a greater diversity of sites. Further studies should \nexplore sites with different characteristics to the ones chosen here, and could therefore \nindicate if the findings of this study could be applicable to other places. Future \nresearch also could explore the link between factors identified here and issues such as \ntourists\u2019 personal characteristics or their expectations from a visit, as well as their \nsatisfaction afterwards. Such investigation could, in turn, lead to better management \nand higher levels of satisfaction among visitors. \n \n \nThis study identified three main reasons for visiting a heritage site. The knowledge \nthat tourists visit heritage places on more than educational and recreational grounds \nclearly has potential implications for the management and decision makers of such \nplaces. The notion that visitors may also show an interest in being 'emotionally \ninvolved' and may feel a 'sense of belonging to the site' and visit 'because it is part of \ntheir heritage' should also be reflected in the operational management of such sites. \n 28\nFor example, these concepts could be borne in mind in marketing and in relation to \nthe interpretation provided. There may be a place to reflect these reasons in \nadvertising campaigns. The fact that tourists are motivated to visit for emotional \nreasons may be reflected in the interpretation provided. There could be more of an \neffort made not just to educate visitors, but also to provide them with an emotional \nexperience. The findings of this study could also contribute to decision making, such \nas by government organizations, which are responsible for the management of several \nheritage sites. For example, as it was established that some tourists visit to feel \nemotionally involved while others come to be educated, those responsible for the \ntourism industry could bear this in mind in their location strategies The findings could \nalso assist tour operators to establish appropriate routes for their customers better to \nreflect their interests. Future research in this area could explore more specifically the \nlink between the interest in interpretation, in relation to motivation to visit, and \nperceptions of site and may lead to a decision to provide different interpretation to \ndifferent tourists. \n \n \nTo conclude, it is suggested that the question raised by Swarbrooke (1994): \n`Heritage - education or entertainment?' is incomplete and ignores those who \nspecifically visit to experience their own heritage rather than observe that of others. \nUsing Urry\u2019s (1990) terminology, it is argued that tourists do not only visit settings \nwhere \u2018their\u2019 history is presented just to \u2018gaze\u2019 but also sometimes to engage with \nwhat is there. \n \n \n 29\n \nReference list \n \nApter, A., Hatab, J., Tyano, S., and A.
