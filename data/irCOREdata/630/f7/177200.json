Abstract  \nObjectives \nTo determine the effectiveness of long-term lifestyle interventions for the prevention of weight gain and morbidity \nin adults.   \nMethods \nPrevention of weight gain is important in adults who are normal weight, overweight and obese. A systematic \nreview of controlled trials of lifestyle interventions in adults with a body mass index of less than 35kg \/m\n2 with at \nleast two years follow-up was carried out.  \nResults  \nEleven of 39 comparisons produced significant improvement in weight between groups at two years or longer with  \nmean difference weight change ranging from -0.5 kg to 11.5 kg. Effective interventions included a 600kcal\/day \ndeficit\/low-fat diet (with and without meal-replacements), low-calorie diet, Weight-Watchers diet, low-fat non-\nreducing diet, diet with behaviour therapy, diet with exercise, diet with exercise and behaviour therapy. Adding \nmeal replacements to a low-fat diet (with and without exercise and behaviour therapy) produced significant \nimprovement in weight. Head-to-head interventions failed to show significant effect on weight with the exception \nof a Mediterranean diet with behaviour therapy compared to low-fat diet. Diet with exercise and\/or behaviour \ntherapy demonstrated significant reduction in hypertension and improvement in risk of metabolic syndrome and \ndiabetes compared to no treatment control.  \nConclusions \nLifestyle interventions demonstrated significant improvement in weight, reduction in hypertension and reduction in \nrisk of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.   \nWord count: 213. \n 4 \n2. Introduction  \nObesity and related disease present a public health crisis. Energy-dense diets and sedentary lifestyles are associated \nwith obesity. Changing behaviours to reduce disease burden is recognised on a European and global scale through \nthe EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health1 and the WHO global strategy on diet, physical \nactivity and health2.  The UK government obesity strategy and \u00a375m campaign3 is in response to the NICE obesity \nguidance4 and future predictions in the Foresight report5.  Through the Change4Life campaign3 the UK Department \nof Health is providing \u00a330m to help nine towns encourage healthy lifestyles6.  \nThese initiatives are underpinned by evidence from interventions which focus on changing behaviours. An earlier \nreview7 of obesity treatments recommended that a systematic review of interventions to prevent obesity should be \nundertaken. \nThis systematic review is the first phase of the National Prevention Research Initiative funded economic evaluation \nof obesity prevention for UK adults. The objective is to determine the effectiveness of interventions that focus on \nimproving diet and activity behaviours in adults who are normal weight, overweight and obese, to prevent weight \ngain and morbidity in the long-term.  \n \n3. Methods \nIncluded were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before and after studies (CBAs) of a lifestyle \ninterventions (diet, exercise, behaviour, environmental) in adults (18-65y) with body mass index (BMI) <35kg \/m\n2\n \nreporting weight at least two years post randomisation.  Data were also extracted for risk factors, morbidity and \nmortality. The amount and distribution of fat determines the risk of obesity-related diseases and in general the more \noverweight the greater the risk. Adults classified as pre-obese (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg \/m\n2\n) or obese class 1 (BMI 30.0-\n34.9 kg \/m\n2\n) are an important target group for the prevention of weight gain because they have an increased risk of \nelevated risk factors for disease and obesity-related morbidities; such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, impaired \nglucose tolerance, metabolic and hormonal changes, which in turn contribute to cardiovascular disease, cancers, \nmetabolic and endocrine diseases such as type 2 diabetes, and osteoarthritis.  \nDiets categorization included: 600kcal\/day deficit\/low-fat diet; low-calorie diet (LCD) (1000-1600 kcal\/d); very \nlow-calorie diet (VLCD) (<1000 kcal\/d). Interventions were categorised as interventions with definite intention to \nlose weight (clearly targeted calorie reduction) and interventions with no definite intention to lose weight (no target \nfor weight loss).  No type of diet was excluded. If an intervention included two or more diets, the most stringent \ncalorie restriction was used to classify the diet. \nFor exercise or behaviour therapy interventions study investigators had to give a detailed description of the \ncomponents of the intervention and details of the theory underpinning the behavioural intervention.   \nInterventions targeting smoking cessation or salt reduction in addition to weight loss were not included. Studies \nwere excluded in participants with eating disorders, pregnant women and severely mentally or physically \n 5 \nhandicapped adults. Studies in non-white populations were included if the ethnic group and setting were relevant to \nthe UK ethnic population. \nThe literature search involved four phases (see Appendix 1 for search strategies). Phase one: primary studies \nidentified from two systematic reviews4;7.  Phase two: CAB Abstracts, CDSR, CINAHL, DARE, EMBASE, \nMEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched and systematic reviews were screened for primary studies. Phase three: \nCAB Abstracts, CCTR, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched for primary studies \npublished between January 2005 - August 2006.  Phase four: MEDLINE was searched for primary studies \npublished between September 2006 - August 2007.  A search of one database only was carried out in the final \nphase in order to identify any studies published since the main searches were performed in August 2006. No \nlanguage restriction was applied. Only full reports from 1990 were considered.  The International Journal of \nObesity (January 2006 - August 2007) and Obesity were hand-searched online from January 2006 - September \n2007 in order to identify studies which were not yet indexed on electronic databases. \nWhere results from studies could be quantitatively combined meta-analyses were undertaken.  Data from RCTs and \nCBAs were analysed separately. Data synthesis (including handling of missing data) and quality assessment were \nbased on those previously undertaken7.  For continuous data a weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated \n(weighted by the inverse of the variance of the effect estimate) and Mantel-Haenszel methods were applied for \ndichotomous data; both using a fixed effects approach and RevMan 4.2.5 software8. In the case of missing standard \ndeviations (SDs) for changes in weight and risk factors, assumptions were made (irrespective of whether the \nchanges were negative or positive). A linear regression was made of the SD of the mean change in weight on the \nabsolute mean change for weight, for the studies which provided these data, and used to impute values for missing \nSDs: \n\u25cf SD of weight change in kg = 5.915 + (0.283 x mean change in weight). \nSimilar linear regressions were attempted for risk factors. However, clear relationships were not found, so the \nmeans of reported SDs were used to impute values for missing SDs (see Appendix 14): \n\u25cf SD for change in SBP = 12.7 mmHg \n\u25cfSD for change in DBP = 8.3 mmHg \n\u25cfSD for change in cholesterol = 1.08 mmol\/l \n\u25cfSD for change in LDL cholesterol = 0.74 mmol\/l \n\u25cfSD for change in HDL cholesterol = 0.29 mmol\/l \n\u25cfSD for change in triglycerides = 0.96 mmol\/l. \nIn the case of fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c, two levels of SDs were used, to allow for the greater variability \nof such measures evident from the studies. \n\u25cf If the initial fasting plasma glucose was <7 mmol\/l, the SD for change in fasting plasma glucose was 1.35 \nmmol\/l. \n\u25cf If the initial fasting plasma glucose was \u2265 7 mmol\/l, the SD for change in fasting plasma glucose was 3.77 \nmmol\/l. \n\u25cf If the initial HbA1c was < 7%, the SD for change in HbA1c was 0.71%. \n 6 \n\u25cf If the initial HbA1c was \u2265 7%, the SD for change in HbA1c was 2.58%. \n \nResults were described separately for individual studies where the change in outcome data between two time-points \ncould not be calculated or the number of participants in each group was not reported. \n \n4. Results  \n4.1 Literature search \nThirty-nine RCTs9-62;64 and one CBA63were included (Figure1, Table 1). Twenty-four studies were US-based, four \nwere based in Finland, three in The Netherlands, two in the UK27;28, two in Canada, two in India, and one each in \nGermany, Italy and Australia. Eight were community studies and 32 were in secondary care. Twenty studies were \n24-months in duration, 11 studies were between 30 and 36-months duration and nine studies ranged in duration \nfrom 38 to 97 months.  Twenty studies recruited 200-2000 participants and five studies recruited over 2000 \nparticipants. In studies with less than 200 participants; sample size ranged from 16 to 180. The largest study was \nthe Women\u2019s Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial42;45;46;61;62 (WHIDMT) with nearly 49,000 women. \nTwenty-five studies recruited men and women, 14 studies recruited women and one study recruited men. At least \n29 studies recruited participants with risk factors for disease, history of disease or disease, such as hypertension, \ntype 2 diabetes and breast cancer. Mean baseline BMI was <30kg\/m\n2\n in 22 studies, unclear in two studies and \n\u226530kg\/m\n2\n in 16 studies. The majority of studies had a mean age between 40-60 years.  \nTwenty-four studies specifically intended participants to lose weight and 16 did not. Thirty-two studies included \ntwo comparisons groups only (Table 2). Forty studies provided 39 different comparisons. There were no long-term \nstudies identified that compared an exercise intervention to control.  \nReports of the 39 RCTs9-62;64 varied in quality with 12 clearly reporting allocation concealment, 10 applying an \nintention-to-treat analysis and two reporting effective blinding of outcome assessors (Table 3).   \n \n4.2 Study results (Table 4) \nStudies with an intention to lose weight \nDietary interventions versus control \n600 kcal\/day deficit\/low-fat diet versus control \nFive studies assessed a 600 kcal\/day deficit\/low-fat diet21;22;24;30;33-34. Three studies recruited people with \nhypertension or \u2018high normal\u2019 blood pressure, one study recruited patients with oesophageal cancer and one \nrecruited participants with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). \n \nWeight  \n 7 \n600 kcal\/d deficit or low-fat diet was associated with non-significant weight changes at 24 and 30 months. \nHowever at 36 months, the Hypertension Prevention Trial22 (HPT) was associated with a significant WMD weight \nchange of -3.49 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.63 to -2.35 kg).  \nTwo studies were not included in the meta-analyses. Kristal et al24 reported a non-significant intervention effect on \nweight compared with control at 36 months (-1.4 kg). Ramachandran et al30 reported a significant increase in \nweight from baseline at 24 and 30 months in the control group (approximately 0.8 and 0.95 kg respectively) and at \n24 months only in the diet group (approximately 0.4 kg). \n \nRisk factors \nIn the HPT22, blood pressure improved with diet at 36 months but did not reach statistical significance. \n \nClinical outcomes  \nParticipants receiving diet in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment21 (HOT) study required significantly fewer \nantihypertensive medications. Nine percent of intervention and control groups required drug treatment for \nhypertension during the three years of the HPT22. Weight loss increased the likelihood a patient would be \ncontrolled on antihypertensive monotherapy in the Trial of Antihypertensive Interventions and Management \n(TAIM) study33-35. \nIn Ramachandran et al30 the cumulative incidence of diabetes at three years was 55% in the control group and \n39.3% in the diet group. Relative risk reduction was 28.5% compared with control.  \n \nLow-calorie diet (LCD) versus control \nWeight  \nOne study38 was associated with a significant WMD weight change of -7.00 kg (95% CI -10.99 to -3.01 kg) at 24 \nmonths and -6.10 kg (95% CI -10.71 to -1.49 kg) at 36 months in 54 women treated for breast cancer. Wide CIs \nreflect the small sample size and there was nearly 40% dropout at 36 months. \n \nWeight Watchers versus self-help \nWeight \nOne study20 of Weight Watchers was associated with a significant WMD weight change of -2.70 kg (95% CI -3.95 \nto -1.45 kg) at 24 months (423 adults, majority women, BMI 34 kg\/m2).  \n \nRisk factors \nAuthors reported no significant difference between groups for risk factors or quality of life at 24 months. \n \n600 kcal\/day deficit\/low-fat diet plus meal replacements versus control \nWeight  \n 8 \nOne study63 of a 600 kcal\/day deficit\/low-fat diet using meal replacements (Slimfast shakes twice daily for three \nmonths then once daily for 57 months) compared with a no-contact matched control group was associated with a \nWMD weight change of -11.49 kg (95% CI -12.98 to -10.00 kg) at two years.  \n \nVery low calorie diet (VLCD) using meal replacements (Cambridge diet) versus low-fat control \nWeight  \nThere was a non-significant weight change in favour of VLCD at 24 months amongst 16 obese Finnish adults with \nnewly diagnosed type 2 diabetes31. Risk factor data were not assessed as there were significant baseline differences \nbetween groups. \n \nBehavioural interventions versus control \nWeight  \nBehaviour therapy delivered either by telephone or mail by trained nutritionists versus control showed no \nsignificant effect on weight at 24 months in US adults from a managed care organisation54. Cost-effectiveness of \ntelephone counselling was $132\/kg lost, with mail and usual care control achieving similar cost-efficiency of $72\/ \nkg lost. \n \nDiet and exercise versus control \nThree RCTs18;19;26;28;59 assessed diet and exercise and all participants were at high risk of or had IGT. The types of \ndiet and exercise interventions varied between studies (Table 1). \n \nWeight \nDiet and exercise was associated with significant WMD weight change at 24 months (-2.56 kg, 95% CI -3.34 to -\n1.77 kg).  \n \nRisk factors \nThere was an associated improvement in triglycerides in two studies26;28 (WMD -0.54 mmol\/L, 95% CI -0.85 to -\n0.24 mmol\/L) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in three studies18;19;26;28;59 (WMD -0.30 mmol\/L, 95% CI -0.42 to -\n0.18 mmol\/L) but not cholesterol, blood pressure or HbA1c.  \n \nClinical outcomes  \nAt four years the cumulative incidence of diabetes in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (FDPS) was 11% \n(95% CI 6 to 15%) in the intervention group and 23% (95% CI 17 to 29%) in the control group (risk of diabetes \nreduced by 58%).  At six years there was a 43% reduction in relative risk (RR)18;19. Normal glucose tolerance was \npresent in 50% of intervention participants and 29% of control participants after two years in the study by Mensink \net al26 (P<0.05). In the FDPS, at mean follow-up 3.9 years; 62.6% intervention participants and 71.2% control \nparticipants had metabolic syndrome (sex and age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.62 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.95)59. \n \n 9 \nDiet, exercise and behaviour therapy versus control \nFive RCTs16;17;23;25;27;36;37 assessed diet, exercise and behaviour therapy. The types of diet and exercise interventions \nvaried between studies (Table 1). \n \nWeight  \nDiet and exercise and behaviour therapy was associated with significant WMD weight changes at 24 months (-2.47 \nkg, 95% CI -3.18 to -1.77 kg, two studies), 30 months (-2.04 kg, 95% CI -2.70 to -1.39 kg, two studies) and 54 \nmonths (-2.50 kg, 95% CI -3.59 to -1.41 kg, one study).  \nWe were unable to meta-analyse the Diabetes Prevention Program16;17 (DPP) however the authors reported average \nweight loss at 2.8 years was 5.6 kg in the intensive low-fat diet, exercise and behavioural modification programme \nand 0.1 kg in the control group.  Kuller et al25 did not present participant numbers for the 30 and 42-month follow-\nup however the authors reported significant improvement in weight. \n \nRisk factors  \nThe benefit of significant weight loss was not consistently reflected in improved risk factors. Although Kuller et \nal25 demonstrated significant weight loss and improvements in LDL-cholesterol there was no significant \nimprovement in HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, FPG or blood pressure at 54 months. The Trials of Hypertension \nPrevention phase II36;37 (TOHPII) study demonstrated significant weight loss and showed significant improvement \nin systolic but not diastolic blood pressure at 30 months. \n \nClinical outcomes \nThe DPP16;17 significantly reduced the risk of developing diabetes and the metabolic syndrome for up to three years \nin over 2000 obese adults with IGT at baseline. \nIn the DPP16;17 the crude incidence of diabetes was 11\/100 in the control group and 4.8\/100 in the lifestyle \nintervention. The incidence of diabetes was 58% lower (95% CI 48 to 66%) in the lifestyle intervention group than \nthe control. The estimated cumulative incidence of diabetes at three years was 28.9% in the control and 14.4% in \nthe lifestyle-intervention group. Incidence of metabolic syndrome was reduced 41% in the lifestyle intervention \ncompared with control (P<0.001).   \nIn TOHP II36;37, the RR of developing hypertension for the weight loss group was 0.87 (p=0.06) at 48 months. \n \nAdjuncts to diet \nThe addition of extra fruit and vegetables and exercise to a low-fat low-cholesterol diet was associated with a \nweight change of -6.10 kg compared with -2.1 kg in the low-fat low-cholesterol group at 36 months in mostly men \nwith or at risk of coronary artery disease32. Authors reported significant improvement in cholesterol, triglycerides, \nfasting blood glucose and blood pressure.  \n 10 \nThe addition of exercise and behaviour therapy to diet was associated with a non-significant difference in weight \nloss between groups at 24 months in one study of obese adults with type 2 diabetes10. A significant improvement in \ntotal cholesterol was found at 24-months (-0.3 mmol\/L (95% CI -0.6 to -0.1 mmol\/L) but not for blood pressure. \nThe addition of meal replacements (Slimfast) to a low-fat diet for the initial three months was associated with a \nnon-significant weight change at 27 months but a significant weight change at 51 months (-5.40 kg, 95% CI -8.97 \nto -1.83 kg) 14;15;43. There was significant improvement in HDL-cholesterol at 27 months (0.17 mmol\/L, 95% CI \n0.03 to 0.31 mmol\/L) and SBP at 51 months (-12.0 mmHg, 95% CI -17.75 to -6.25 mmHg) but not other risk \nfactors. \nWomen who received meal replacements (Slimfast) as part of low-fat diet, exercise and behaviour therapy provided \nin group sessions by a dietitian maintained the greatest weight loss at two years (WMD weight change -6.00 kg \n(95% CI -10.19 to -1.81 kg)9. However dropout was 65% at 24 months. The addition of meal replacements was \nassociated with significant improvement in HDL-cholesterol (0.01 mmol\/L, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.02 mmol\/L) and \nglucose at 24 months (0.03 mmol\/L, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05 mmol\/L) but not other risk factors. \nThe addition of pre-packaged food provision or financial incentives, or both combined and compared with a low-\ncalorie diet, exercise and behaviour therapy intervention, did not significantly improve weight loss at 30 months in \n200 overweight US adults in their late 30s23. \n \nHead-to-head comparisons \nOne study of higher energy expenditure (2500 kcal\/wk) through exercise and increased social support plus small \nmonetary incentives, compared with 1000 kcals\/wk was associated with a non-significant weight change at 30 \nmonths55. Both groups received low-fat diet and standard behaviour therapy. \nThere was no significant difference in weight between delivering behaviour therapy by telephone compared with \nmail in 1801 obese US adults from a managed care organisation at 24 months54. \nThere was no significant difference in weight at 24 months between women who were seen by a dietitian in a group \nand women seen by a nurse or physician in a clinic.  Both groups received low-fat diet including meal \nreplacements, exercise and behaviour therapy9. \nGlucose (0.03 mmol\/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05 mmol\/L) and LDL-Cholesterol (0.02 mmol\/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.03 \nmmol\/L) were significantly improved in the nurse\/physician group compared with the dietitian group at 24 months. \nThere was significant difference in favour of lowered SBP for the dietitian group (-17.00 mmHg, 95% CI -27.91 to \n-6.09 mmHg). No other risk factor data was significantly different9. \n4.3 Studies where the primary intention was not to lose weight \nDietary interventions versus control \nWeight \n 11 \nA low-fat non-reducing diet was associated with a statistically significant weight change of -1.42 kg (95% CI -2.10 \nto -0.74 kg) at 24 months from two studies13;39; 40.  Both studies were in women of normal weight who had either \nsurvived breast cancer or were at risk of breast cancer.   \nTwo other studies reported weight change. There was a significant reduction in weight in the intervention group \ncompared with the control at 24-months (approximately -1.6 kg vs +1.5 kg respectively) in the feasibility trial for \nthe Women\u2019s Intervention Nutrition Study41 (WINS-FT). In another study the intensive diet group increased mean \nweight by 2.09 kg and the routine diet group increased weight by 1.57 kg at a median of 51 months follow-up57. \nThere was a significant difference in the follow-up duration (median 58.6 months for intensive diet and 47.9 \nmonths for routine diet).  \n \nClinical outcomes \nThere was no significant difference in the incidence of diabetes at 51 months in women of normal weight with a \nrecent history of gestational diabetes57, 6.1% for the intensive diet group and 7.3% for the routine diet group, an \nincidence rate of 0.83 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.48, p=0.50).  \nA low-fat non-reducing diet significantly reduced the area of mammographic density (a risk factor for cancer) \ncompared with control at two years13.  \n \nBehavioural interventions versus control \nWeight \nBehaviour therapy versus control showed no significant effect on weight at 24 months (one study of 115 physically \nactive Canadian undergraduates, mean age 20y, mean BMI 22.4 kg\/m2)50.  \n \nRisk factors \nThere were no significant differences between groups in total cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol, however there was a \nsignificant difference in favour of behaviour therapy for triglycerides at 24 months (-0.20 mmol\/L, 95% CI -0.40 to \n0.00 mmol\/L)50. \n \nDiet and exercise versus control \nWeight \nDiet and exercise education \u2013 with or without financial incentives - did not prevent weight gain in 809 overweight \nbut otherwise healthy adults in one community-based study (Pound of Prevention) at 24 and 36 months29. For diet \nand exercise, diet and exercise with incentives, and control; weight change was +1.3 kg, +1.2 kg, +1.4 kg at two \nyears and +1.6 kg, +1.5 kg, +1.8 kg at three years respectively. \n \nDiet and behaviour versus control \n 12 \nFour studies42;45;46;52;58;60-62;64 ranged in size from 2079 participants to 48835 women. The Polyp Prevention Trial52;60 \n(PPT) recruited men and women with a recent large-bowel adenomatous polyp, two studies; Women\u2019s Healthy \nEating and Living58 (WHEL) and Women\u2019s Intervention Nutrition Study64(WINS) recruited women with \npreviously treated or resected early stage breast cancer, and the Women\u2019s Health Initiative Dietary Modification \nTrial42;45;46;61;62(WHIDMT) recruited postmenopausal women. \n \nWeight \nDiet and behaviour therapy was associated with a significant weight change of -1.01 kg (95% CI -1.34 to -0.68 kg, \n2 studies) at 24 months, -1.77 kg (95% CI -1.94 to -1.59 kg, 3 studies) at 36 months (figure 2), -0.52 kg (95% CI -\n0.85 to -0.19 kg, 2 studies) at 48 months and -0.70 kg (95% CI -0.90 to -0.50 kg, one study) at 90 months. The \ndifference in weight was not significant at 72 months. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies.  \nWINS64 reported a difference between intervention and control (in favour of intervention) of -1.8 kg (95% CI -3.1 \nto 0.2 kg) at three years and -2.7 kg (95% CI -4.5 to -0.9 kg) at five years. \n \nRisk factors \nDespite significant weight loss, the PPT52;60 showed no significant difference between groups for cholesterol at 24, \n36 and 48 months.  \n \nClinical outcomes \nDiet and behaviour therapy interventions did not significantly reduce incident cancers including colorectal, breast, \nendometrial or ovarian cancer61, risk of recurrent adenomatas60 or mortality from colorectal or breast cancer45;46 \nover 8 years.  However interim results suggest that intervention women in WINS64 had a 24% lower risk of relapse \nevents than women in control at five years (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60, 0.98).  \nThe WHIDMT showed no significant difference in overall incidence of ovarian cancer (hazard ratio (HR) 0.83, \n95% CI 0.60 to 1.14) and cancer of the endometrium (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.40) at 8.1 years. However ovarian \ncancer risk was lower in the intervention group for the final four years (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.96) 61. HR for \ncolorectal cancer was 1.08 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.29) and mortality from colorectal cancer was 1.26 (95% CI 0.85 to \n1.85) over 8.1 years 45;46. HR for breast cancer was 0.91 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.01)  and mortality from breast cancer \nwas 0.77 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.22)45;46.  HR for confirmed breast cancer event was 0.96 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.14; P = \n0.63) in the WHEL58study over 7.3 years. \nRisk of recurrent adenomatas was not significantly reduced in intervention participants of the PPT at four or eight \nyears (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.39 at 8y)60.  \nThe WHIDMT found no evidence for reducing diabetes risk after 8.1 years, HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.03)62. \n \nDiet, exercise and behaviour therapy versus control \nWeight \n 13 \nDiet and exercise and behaviour therapy (clinic-based or home-based) was associated with non-significant weight \nchanges at 24 and at 36 months compared with control in 284 healthy women in their mid 30s53.  \n \nAdjuncts to diet \nDiet plus exercise versus diet \nTwo RCTs set in Finland were included11;12;49. One study was community-based and recruited 90 men at risk of \ndeveloping the metabolic syndrome (BMI 30-40 kg\/m2, waist circumference >100cm) 11;12. The other49 recruited \neighty-two women, mean age 40 years, mean BMI 34 kg\/m2. Both included studies had a VLCD of 8-12 weeks and \nhad a mean weight loss of 13.1 to 14.3 kg prior to randomisation.  \n \n \nWeight \nThe addition of exercise to a low-fat diet was associated with a non-significant weight change at 29-33 months, \nirrespective of type (walking or resistance training) or amount (3.6 MJ\/wk-8.4 MJ\/wk) (figure 3). Men randomised \nto the walking group had 33% dropout compared with 13% dropout in the resistance training group11;12. \n \nRisk factors \nThe addition of exercise to a low-fat diet did not improve risk factors in women at 33 months49. \nClinical outcomes \nThe OR for the occurrence of metabolic syndrome (from two months prior to randomisation, both groups \ncombined) was 0.29 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.50).11;12.   \n \nOther comparisons \nA Mediterranean diet with behaviour therapy versus a standard low-fat diet was associated with significant weight \nchange at 24 months (-2.80 kg, 95% CI -3.06 to -2.54 kg) in 180 sedentary Italian adults with metabolic \nsyndrome48. There were significant improvements in total cholesterol (-0.23mmol\/L, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.20 \nmmol\/L) and HDL-cholesterol (0.07 mmol\/L, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.08 mmol\/L ), triglycerides (-0.21 mmol\/L, 95% CI \n-0.23 to -0.29 mmol\/L), glucose (-0.33 mmol\/L, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.29 mmol\/L) and blood pressure (SBP -3.00 \nmmHg, 95% CI -3.46 to -2.54 mmHg; DBP -2.00 mmHg, 95% CI -2.29 to -1.71 mmHg) at 24 months.  \nA low-fat non-reducing vegan diet compared with a low-fat non-reducing diet was associated with a non-\nsignificant weight change at 24 months in 62 overweight postmenopausal women56. Participants offered group \nsupport for one year after the initial intervention (regardless of group) lost more weight at 24 months compared \nwith participants not offered group support. Vegan supported participants lost significantly more weight than \nunsupported vegan participants at 24 months (-4.95 kg; 95% CI -7.50 to -2.40 kg) (figure 4). \nThere was no significant difference in weight between clinic-based diet, exercise and behaviour therapy and home-\nbased diet, exercise and behaviour therapy at 24 and 36 months in 284 healthy normal weight women in their mid \n30s53. \n 14 \nThere was no significant difference in BMI between supervised group-based higher-intensity exercise set in the \ncommunity versus unsupervised individual higher-intensity home-based exercise51. There was no significant \ndifference in BMI between unsupervised individual higher-intensity home-based exercise and unsupervised \nindividual lower-intensity home-based exercise51.  There were no significant differences between groups for risk \nfactors. \nThere was no significant difference in weight between traditional structured exercise and behaviour therapy versus \nlifestyle physical activity and behaviour therapy at 24 months in 237 sedentary, overweight adults47. Only \ntriglycerides were significantly improved in participants in the traditional structured exercise group compared with \nlifestyle physical activity at 24 months (-0.18 mmol\/L, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.03 mmol\/L).  \nThere was no significant difference in weight or risk factors between exercise to expend 8.4 MJ\/wk versus 4.2 \nMJ\/wk (both groups received diet) at 33 months in 82 obese premenopausal women49. \nThere was no significant difference in weight between walking (5.2 MJ\/wk) and resistance training (3.6 MJ\/wk) at \n31 months in 90 obese men11;12. \nLow-fat non-reducing diet and exercise with incentives compared with low-fat non-reducing diet and exercise \nwithout incentives did not prevent weight gain in 809 overweight but otherwise healthy adults in one community-\nbased study at 24 and 36 months29. Diet with exercise and incentives versus diet with exercise; weight change was \n+1.2 kg vs. +1.3 kg at two years and +1.5 kg vs. +1.6 kg at three years. \n \n4.4 Deaths and clinical outcomes  \nMeta-analyses showed no significant difference between lifestyle interventions and control groups for deaths \n(figure 5), stroke, heart disease or cancer outcomes.  Diet and behaviour therapy suggest reduced risk of breast \ncancer recurrence at five years64 and ovarian cancer in the final four years of an eight year trial61. \nInterim results suggest that intervention women in WINS64 had a 24% lower risk of breast cancer recurrence than \nwomen in control at five years (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98). Ovarian cancer risk was lower in the intervention \ngroup for the final four years (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.96) of the WHIDMT 61. \nThere is evidence that lifestyle intervention can prevent diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Two studies were \nterminated early16;17;30 due to unequivocal evidence of effectiveness of the lifestyle intervention in significantly \nreducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. \nThe DPP16;17 demonstrated that an intensive low-fat diet, exercise and psychological support intervention compared \nwith control can prevent the metabolic syndrome at three years (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.69). Combined data \nfrom the DPP16;17  and a study of Mediterranean diet and behaviour therapy versus standard low-fat diet48 showed \nthat these interventions can resolve cases of the metabolic syndrome for up to three years (RR 2.52, 95% CI 2.08 to \n3.05). (In this case an RR of greater than 1 favours treatment as higher resolutions indicates a better outcome). In \nthe FDPS59, at mean follow-up 3.9 years; 62.6% intervention participants and 71.2% control participants had \nmetabolic syndrome (sex and age-adjusted OR 0.62 (95% CI 0.40-0.95). \n 15 \nThree studies18;19;27;30;59 (diet versus control; diet and exercise versus control; diet, exercise and behaviour therapy \nversus control) showed a significant effect on the prevention of type 2 diabetes up to 6 years (RR 0.68, 95% CI \n0.57 to 0.82). This result is consistent with the results from the DPP16;17 in which the incidence of diabetes was 58% \nlower (95% CI 48 to 66%) in the intensive lifestyle intervention group than the control. However the WHIDMT62 \nshowed no evidence of reducing diabetes risk after 8.1 years. \n \n5. Discussion  \nThis systematic review captured a relatively large number of studies (40), capturing interventions aimed at \npreventing weight gain in adults who were normal weight, overweight and obese. In doing so it extends the \nevidence base beyond a recent review65.  \nEleven of 39 comparisons produced significant improvement in weight, of which eight compared an intervention to a \nnon-treatment control. Eight intended to produce weight loss and produced greater weight loss than the three studies \nnot intending weight loss (WMD weight change 2.0-11.5 kg versus 0.5-2.8 kg respectively). 600kcal\/day deficit\/low-\nfat diets with and without meal-replacements, low-calorie diets, Weight-Watchers, low-fat non-reducing diets; diets \nwith behaviour therapy, exercise or exercise and behaviour therapy produced significant improvement in weight \ncompared with control. Weight loss ranged from -0.5 kg to -11.5 kg. Adding meal replacements produced significant \nimprovement in weight particularly long-term. Direct comparisons of interventions failed to show significant effect \non weight with the exception Mediterranean diet and behaviour therapy compared with a low-fat diet.  \nInterventions combining diet with additional elements compared to control were not always associated with greater \nweight loss. Both diet and exercise and diet, exercise and behaviour therapy produced similar weight changes, less \nthan some of the diets alone and similar to that achieved by Weight Watchers20. There was insufficient evidence to \nassess the benefit of adding exercise or behaviour therapy. There were no studies that assessed the effectiveness of \nadding behaviour therapy or exercise and behaviour therapy to a non-reducing diet. There did not appear to be any \nobvious pattern between intensity of contact or diet prescription and weight change.  \nThe four meal replacement studies9;14;15;31;43;63 began with an intensive phase consisting of meal replacements 2-3 \ntimes daily for three months, then three studies continued to use meal replacements less often (in one study both \ngroups received meal replacements for the maintenance period). Significant benefit to weight was demonstrated in \nthe two studies that assessed the addition of meal replacements in the maintenance phase, although one of these \nwas not a randomised study63.  \nRisk factor data were limited; weight loss did not consistently improve risk factors, some risk factors improved \nindependent of weight change. Another review including lifestyle interventions of at least two years duration found \nthat weight loss of at least 5% baseline weight was not consistently associated with improvement in cardiovascular \nrisk factors and benefits were specific to the intervention and occurred mainly in people with cardiovascular risk \nfactors66.  \nFew studies were powered to detect differences in morbidity and mortality or followed up for sufficient time. There \nwas no significant difference between lifestyle interventions and control groups for deaths, stroke, heart disease or \n 16 \ncancer. Diet and behaviour therapy suggest reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence at five years64 and ovarian \ncancer in the final four years of an eight year trial61. 600 kcal\/day deficit\/low-fat diets can reduce type 2 diabetes, \nimprove blood pressure and reduce antihypertensive medication for up to three years. Diet and exercise reduce the \nrisk of type 2 diabetes for up to six years and the metabolic syndrome at four years, compared to control. Diet with \nexercise and behaviour therapy can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and the metabolic syndrome. \nThe addition of exercise to diet can reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome in men. However a non-reducing diet \nand behaviour therapy did not reduce diabetes risk in nearly 49,000 women after 8.1 years62. \nResearch is required into whether effectiveness of interventions varies with baseline risk, age, gender, ethnic group \nand setting. WHIDMT62 suggests that relatively small amounts of weight loss without increase in physical activity, \nmay account for why the intervention did not reduce the risk of diabetes compared with the FDPS18;19;59 and \nDPP16;17;44. Participants in the FDPS and DPP were at higher risk of developing diabetes and had higher baseline \nBMI compared to the WHIDMT. In the DPP44, lifestyle intervention was most effective in preventing diabetes in \nolder participants (60-85y) perhaps due to greater weight loss and physical activity. Interim analysis of WINS64 diet \nand behaviour intervention suggests significantly reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence in postmenopausal \nwomen, whereas the WHIDMT42;45;46;61;62 and WHEL58 studies did not significantly reduce breast cancer morbidity. \nWomen in the dietary intervention arm of WINS lost more weight than the other studies which may account for the \nlowered risk. \nThere was scant reporting of economic or quality of life data. The FDPS was used to assess whether a lifestyle \nintervention to prevent diabetes in adults with IGT is cost-effective in a Swedish setting67. The model predicted that \nthe intervention would be cost-saving, with an increase in estimated survival of 0.18 years. The predicted cost-\neffectiveness ratio was \u20ac2,363 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.  \nIt was difficult to determine whether some studies were supposed to affect weight or not, or whether exercise or \nbehaviour therapy were provided, and to classify types of diet. Classification of interventions was difficult because \nthe information reported within the papers was insufficient; classification was often arrived at by a consensus \nprocess between reviewers. Where the calorie content of a diet was not clearly stated it was categorized as a \u2018600 \nkcal\/day deficit or low-fat diet\u2019 (where there was a definite intention to provide weight loss) or \u2018low-fat non-\nreducing diet\u2019 (where there was no definite intention to provide weight loss). For exercise or behaviour therapy \ninterventions to be categorised as such, study investigators had to give a detailed description of the components of \nthe intervention.   \nStudies were heterogeneous and the varied comparisons were underpinned by few studies making it difficult to \ngeneralise about effective interventions.  There were inadequate data reported to include some studies in meta-\nanalyses, in addition, it was necessary to calculate weight and risk factor change from absolute values or from \ngraphs which meant that standard deviations needed imputing in 25% of studies.  A minority of studies reported \nadequate allocation concealment, intention-to-treat analyses or blinding of outcome assessors. It was not possible to \nassess the differential effects of interventions according to demographic, socio-economic or cultural \ncharacteristics68.  \n 17 \nThere is limited evidence for lifestyle interventions to prevent weight gain in healthy normal weight adults within \nthe community. To widen the evidence-base requires review of uncontrolled interventions and synthesis of \nevidence from complex public health interventions with new methods to assess evidence. \nThese gaps in the evidence base and inadequacies relating to study design and reporting necessitate \nrecommendations for future interventions to be longer-term and sufficiently powered to detect clinical outcomes. \nAdequate reporting of outcome data would enable all studies to be included in meta-analyses (where relevant to do \nso). Detailed reporting of interventions, participant characteristics, economic and quality-of-life data would \nimprove the quality of future systematic reviews of lifestyle intervention. \n \nConclusion \nDiet, alone and with the addition of exercise and\/or behaviour therapy demonstrated significant weight loss and \nimprovement in metabolic syndrome and diabetes compared to no treatment control for at least two years.  \n \nWord count: 5848.  \n \n \n \n \n 18 \nReference List \n \n (1)  EU members.
