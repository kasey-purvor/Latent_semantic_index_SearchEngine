Received ; in original form\nABSTRACT\nWe investigate the relative distribution of the gaseous contents of the Universe\n(as traced by a sample of Lyman \u03b1 (Ly-\u03b1 ) absorbers), and the luminous baryonic\nmatter (as traced by a redshift survey of galaxies in the same volume searched for\nLy-\u03b1 absorbers), along 16 lines-of-sight (LOS) between redshifts 0 and 1. Our galaxy\nredshift survey was made with the Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS) on Canada-\nFrance-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and, when combined with galaxies from the litera-\nture in the same LOS, gives us a galaxy sample of 636 objects. By combining this with\nan absorption line sample of 406 absorbing systems drawn from published works, we\nare able to study the relationship between gas and galaxies over the latter half of the\nage of the Universe. A correlation between absorbers and galaxies is detected out to\nseparation of 1.5 Mpc. This correlation is weaker than the galaxy-galaxy correlation.\nThere is also some evidence that the absorbing systems seen in CIV are more closely\nrelated to galaxies, although this correlation could be with column density rather\nthan metallicity. The above results are all consistent with the absorbing gas and the\ngalaxies co-existing in dark matter filaments and knots as predicted by current mod-\nels where the column density of the absorbing gas is correlated with the underlying\nmatter density.\nKey words: galaxies \u2013 intergalactic medium, galaxies \u2013 quasars: absorption lines,\ngalaxies \u2013 galaxies: haloes.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThis paper is part of our efforts to provide constraints and\nmeasurements of the relationship between the distribution\nof the gaseous contents of the Universe as traced by neutral\nHydrogen and the luminous baryonic mater as traced by\ngalaxies.\nThe manner in which gas collapses gravitationally into\ndark matter potential wells to form stars (and hence galax-\nies), and the way in which these stars then affect the gas is\na topic of great interest at present. This is being pursued\nboth observationally and theoretically at redshifts from 7\nto zero (i.e. when the universe was approximately 5% of its\ncurrent age, to the present day). In this paper we investi-\ngate this process observationally during the second half of\nthe evolution of the universe.\n\u22c6 Visiting Astronomer, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope oper-\nated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Centre\nNational de la Recherche Scientifique de France and the Univer-\nsity of Hawaii.\nThere is a continuing debate about the relationship be-\ntween low redshift Lyman \u03b1 (Ly-\u03b1) absorbers and galaxies,\nwhere here \u2018low redshift\u2019 is taken to mean redshifts less than\n1. A simplified (strawman) version of the two sides is (a)\nthat all low redshift Ly-\u03b1 absorbers are part of physically-\ndistinct luminous-galaxy halos, or (b) that they are all part\nof the filamentary structure seen in recent SPH\/Mesh struc-\nture formation models, and are only related to galaxies by\nthe fact that both are following the underlying dark mat-\nter distribution. In practice, almost all authors acknowledge\nthat the universe includes a mix of the above two popu-\nlations (and indeed others), and the debate is more about\nwhich population dominates a particular set of observations.\nBoth of these positions have been vigorously defended in\nthe literature.

(2005) and Jena et al.\n(2005).\nRegardless of whether either hypothesis is correct, we\nemphasize that even if one (naively) believes a clear answer\ncan be obtained (either (a) or (b) above), this answer will\nbe a function of the neutral Hydrogen column density of the\nabsorbers. For NH I> 10\n21 cm\u22122, one is probing a column\ndensity of material comparable to that of the disk of our\ngalaxy, and hence all galaxies, to varying degrees, should be\nexpected to contribute to the population of such absorbers.\nAt column densities NH I\u223c 10\n12 cm\u22122, one is getting close\nto the neutral hydrogen content of the expected fluctuations\nwithin voids, and we expect that a more heterogeneous set\nof causes could produce such absorption.\nThe increasingly sophisticated models of galaxy forma-\ntion and evolution now available (see references above) sug-\ngest that if we could make a perfect census of the gaseous\nand luminous constituents of a large volume of the low red-\nshift Universe, we would find that both the gas (quasar ab-\nsorption line systems) and stars (galaxies) trace the same\nfundamental structures (whose course of formation and dis-\ntribution was set by the early perturbations of the distribu-\ntion of dark matter in the Universe). These same models,\nhowever, also indicate that a wide range of detailed rela-\ntionships between the gas and galaxies should be observed.\nThe details of the structures will depend on an equally wide\nrange of interesting astrophysics, including the process of\nstar formation and \u201cgalaxy feedback\u201d and we hope that the\nFigure 1. Illustrative image of the two lines-of-sight (LOS) to\nthe QSOs LBQS 0107-025A and B. The region shown is 7.1\u2019\u00d76.2\u2019,\nwith North up and East to the left. The two QSOs discussed in\nthis paper are labelled, as is a third QSO (labelled C) to the North\n(Young et al. 2001). A few of the measured galaxy redshifts in the\nfield are labelled (drawn so the decimal point is approximately\nabove the relevant galaxy) and the projected spatial offset and\nvelocity difference to detected absorbers in either of the LOS are\nmarked for two example galaxies. See the text for a discussion.\nThe image shown was made from a 90 second exposure without a\nfilter using the Palomar Observatory 5m telescope and COSMIC\nimager\/multi-object spectrograph on September 22, 1995UT.\napproach of this paper can lead to a better understanding\nof this astrophysics.\nObservationally comparing the distribution of galaxies\nand quasar absorption line systems shows some of the com-\nplexity of the phenomena at work. This can be illustrated\nby considering Figure 1. In this figure we show an image of\nthe lines-of-sight (LOS) towards the QSOs LBQS 0107-025A\nand B. As discussed later in the paper, for this field we have\nsamples of galaxies and Ly-\u03b1 absorption line systems whose\nlocations in this common volume of space can be compared.\nIn the figure we have selectively labelled illustrative cases\nof \u2018associated\u2019 galaxies and absorption lines. For two of the\ngalaxies labelled with a redshift, arrows indicate where there\nis a detected absorption line in both of the QSO spectra. For\nthose absorber-galaxy pairs, the projected spatial separation\nand velocity difference between the galaxy and the absorber\nare also provided.\nWe consider a few of these cases below:\n(i) A bright, multi-component object lies between the two\nQSOs at a redshift of 0.2272. There is absorbing gas seen at\nnearly this same redshift in both QSO LOS, and in one of\nthem, CIV absorption is also detected. This then could po-\ntentially be interpreted as a straightforward case of a large\ngaseous halo around a bright galaxy. The complex morphol-\nogy of the galaxy could indicate an ongoing merger.\n(ii) At a distance of 350 kpc to the south and east of the\ntwo QSO LOS is another bright morphologically-complex\ngalaxy at a redshift of 0.1145. This galaxy is also close in\nvelocity to absorption seen in both LOS. It is instructive\nthough to compare the small visible extent of the stars in\nThe association between gas and galaxies 3\nthe (large) galaxy with the distance to the two QSO LOS.\nSmooth, undisturbed gaseous halos of this size seem im-\nprobable, although it is one of the goals of this paper to\ninvestigate this statistically.\n(iii) Generally to the north of the two QSOs are a collec-\ntion of 5 galaxies marked with redshifts near 0.20. All 5 of\nthese galaxies are within 500 km s\u22121 (and also within a pro-\njected distance of 500 kpc) of an absorber seen in the LOS\nto LBQS 0107-025B. No absorption is detected in the other\nQSO LOS. This collection illustrates the common difficulty\nof picking out one individual galaxy to tie to one absorber.\nAlthough there is indeed a single \u2018closest\u2019 galaxy, it seems\nrather arbitrary to claim that it is the sole cause of any\nabsorption.\n(iv) Finally, a collection of six galaxies, all within 500 km\ns\u22121 of each other at a redshift around 0.24 are marked sur-\nrounding the LOS to LBQS 0107-025A. Despite their prox-\nimity to the LOS, and the case above where a group of galax-\nies can be associated with an absorber, no absorption is seen\nat this redshift in either of the two QSO LOS. While one\ncould speculate that low column density absorbers might be\nfragile entities that are destroyed in a dense environment,\nthere is no good independent evidence at present that this\ngalaxy \u2018group\u2019 has crossed such a threshold.\nThese examples demonstrate the great variety of ap-\npearances the underlying relationship between the absorbers\nand galaxies presents, along even one LOS. This richness\nshould be kept in mind when interpreting the results de-\nrived from the ensemble of data we consider in this paper.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows: in \u00a7 2 we describe\nthe various data sets used in this paper. In \u00a7 3 we analyse\nthe data, and in \u00a7 4 we present our conclusions.\n2 DATA\nOur observational program would ideally be designed to al-\nlow a statistical comparison between the absorption gas de-\ntected in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV spectroscopy\nbetween redshifts of 0 and 1 and the galaxies within a\ncylindrical region at least 3 Mpc1 in radial extent away\nfrom the QSO Line of Sight (LOS). In practice, what we\nachieved was an absorption line sample taken from the HST\nQuasar Absorption Line Survey (Bahcall et al. 1993, 1996;\nJannuzi et al. 1998), an HST Key Project during cycles 1-4,\nwith varying redshift coverage, and galaxy samples from a\nvariety of observatories. The main one reported here was\nobtained using the Multi-Object Spectrograph (MOS) at\nthe Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). Some addi-\ntional galaxy redshifts have been obtained using the COS-\nMIC spectrograph at Palomar, and gleaned from the lit-\nerature. We are in the process of supplementing this data\nset with additional observations using other facilities. Al-\nthough we do not claim that any of these galaxy samples\nare \u2018complete\u2019, we have endeavoured to ensure that they\nall come with known selection functions, allowing a statisti-\ncal analysis to be performed. Completeness in this context\n1 Throughout we assume H0=70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121, \u2126=0.3 and\n\u039b=0.7. Impact parameters are reported in physical rather than\ncomoving coordinates.\nwould be rather an illusory concept, as there will always be\nweaker lines and less luminous or lower surface brightness\ngalaxies that are missed by any survey. This point has been\nmade by many authors including Linder (1998, 2000) and\nRosenberg et al. (2003).\n2.1 Sample definition\nThe fields observed with MOS on the CFHT were chosen to\ninclude Key Project QSOs (Jannuzi et al. 1998) with QSO\nredshift greater than 0.5 and Faint Object Spectrograph\n(FOS) higher dispersion spectroscopy covering from redshift\n0.34 to 1 (i.e., FOS gratings G190H and G270H). While UV\nspectroscopy down to z=0 is obviously desirable (and has\nbeen obtained with the HST along a limited number of sight\nlines) the KP LOS including coverage to z=0 (observations\nmade with the FOS G130H grating) are of QSOs with red-\nshifts too low for efficient CFHT MOS followup. In Table 1\nwe list the QSOs selected. The columns include the QSO\nRA, Dec, redshift and V band magnitude, followed by the\ndate of the HST UV spectroscopy for the 3 FOS gratings\nused in this paper, followed by the number of CFHT MOS\nmasks observed (see \u00a7 2.4) and the date of the MOS obser-\nvation.\nThere is one additional field observed as part of the\nCFHT MOS sample which was not part of the HST Key\nProject. HST UV spectra of the QSO pair LBQS 0107-025A\nand LBQS 0107-025B were studied by Dinshaw et al. (1995),\nDinshaw et al. (1997) and Young et al. (2001). This LOS\nwas included in the CFHT MOS target list because of the\npresence of two QSOs bright enough for reasonable S\/N HST\nUV spectroscopy within the MOS field of view. An analysis\ntaking full advantage of this will be performed in a later\npaper, but for the present paper we generally use them as\ntwo \u2018separate\u2019 LOS. We have checked whether removing one\nof the LBQS 0107-025 QSOs from the sample makes any\nsignificant difference to our numerical results or conclusions,\nand have found that it does not.\n2.2 HST Quasar Absorption Line Sample\nThe complete list of selection criteria for the KP quasars\nis discussed in section 2.1 of Jannuzi et al. (1998). We re-\nview here only the criteria used by the KP that might pro-\nduce a bias for our study. First is their practical decision\nto select targets with bright V-band magnitudes and well\ndetermined redshifts in order for their targets to have pre-\ndictable UV luminosities that, in the absence of high column\ndensity absorption systems along the LOS, would enable a\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio UV spectrum to be obtained in a\nmodest exposure time with HST. A sample biased toward\nobjects bright in V-band apparent magnitude might be more\ninclined to include lensed quasars, i.e. objects with a fore-\nground over-density along the LOS. In practice, the redshifts\nof the quasars included in the KP are low, and therefore\nless likely to be lensed. Second, a subset of the quasars in-\ncluded in the KP sample were not randomly selected, but\nwere chosen for a GTO program of J.

(1992))\nand 3C 232 (with the galaxy NGC 3067 in the foreground).\nOf the objects we selected from the KP catalogues for obser-\nvation with CFHT, only NAB 0024+22 was not a randomly\nselected target by the KP. This quasar was part of the GTO\nprogram of Bahcall and was selected because it was discov-\nered as part of a search for quasars with LOS near a cluster\nof galaxies (Bahcall et al. 1973). Abell 31, with a redshift of\n0.160, is along the LOS to this quasar. The cluster redshift\nis smaller than the range we investigate along this LOS.\nWe had two additional criteria for selecting our sample\nfor the CFHT observations. The fields needed to be observ-\nable during our scheduled CFHT observing runs. We chose\nto focus on LOS with quasars with redshifts greater than\n0.5, in order to maximize the efficiency of our redshift galaxy\nsurvey.\nWith the previously mentioned exception of\nLBQS 0107\u2212025A and B, the sample of absorption lines we\nuse is drawn from the KP catalogue papers, Bahcall et al.\n(1993), Bahcall et al. (1996), and Jannuzi et al. (1998).\nThe KP Ly-\u03b1 absorption line catalogue was constructed to\ninclude all features with a significance level greater than\n4.5\u03c3 (as defined and discussed by Schneider et al. (1993)).\nThis corresponds to a variable equivalent width limit along\neach LOS. Plots showing these equivalent width limits as a\nfunction of wavelength are given in Figure 2 of Jannuzi et al.\n(1998). With the modest spectral resolution of the FOS\n(R=1300; approximately 230 km s\u22121), the Ly-\u03b1 absorption\nfeatures were generally unresolved and conversion from the\nobserved equivalent width to column density in neutral\nhydrogen must be done with some assumption about the\nDoppler-b parameter for the lines. For the subset of lines\nthat were broader than the instrumental profile, their width\nprobably indicates the blending of multiple absorption\nfeatures, and not a line profile that can be fit to deduce the\ncolumn density of the absorber. We note that approximately\n10% of the detected Key Project Ly-\u03b1 absorbers were in\nfact resolved, and, as noted by Jannuzi et al. (1998), are\na sign of possible clustering of absorbers on these velocity\nscales. This results in an additional contribution to the\nuncertainty in the derived column densities.\nFor LBQS 0107\u2212025A and B we have chosen to\nuse the line lists from Young et al. (2001), supplemented\nwith lines from the GHRS observations of Dinshaw et al.\n(1997). (In detail this meant adopting the lines from Ta-\nble 5 of Dinshaw et al. (1997), and Tables 3 and 5 of\nYoung et al. (2001) for LBQS 0107\u2212025A, and from Table 5\nof Dinshaw et al. (1997), and Tables 4 and 6 of Young et al.\n(2001) for LBQS 0107\u2212025B.) We shifted the wavelengths\nof the Dinshaw et al. (1997) by -1.72A\u02da as recommended by\nYoung et al. (2001).\nWe want the subset of absorbers caused by interven-\ning, rather than associated, absorption systems. We follow\nWeymann et al. (1998) and exclude any line from our sample\nwith a difference of less than 3,000 km s\u22121 from the systemic\nvelocity of the quasar. Note that while this is a traditional\nchoice of velocity range for excluding associated systems, it\nwill not exclude all associated systems. In particular, one\nof our quasars, PG 2302+029, includes at least one asso-\nciated system with an ejection velocity of over 50,000 km\ns\u22121(Jannuzi et al. (1996); Sabra et al. (2003); Jannuzi et al.\n2006, in preparation). We have excluded the broad system\nat z = 0.695 from the sample used in this paper.\nAll of the line lists we use have complete identifications\nwith the exception of the spectrum of PG1718+481. The\neffects of the incomplete identification of the PG1718+481\nabsorbers are discussed in \u00a7 3.4, where it is shown they are\nnegligable.\n2.2.1 Comments on Individual Lines of Sight\nDetailed notes about the HST FOS spectra along the indi-\nvidual LOS we are studying, and the resulting absorption\nline lists, are included in the KP catalogue papers and in\nYoung et al. (2001)(for the LBQS 0107\u2212025 LOS). Here we\ncomment on the special properties of a few of the fields.\nAs previously mentioned, NAB 0024+22 was discovered\nduring a search for quasars near or behind clusters of galax-\nies (Bahcall et al. 1973). Abell 31, with a redshift of 0.160,\nis foreground to the redshift range covered by the FOS spec-\nThe association between gas and galaxies 5\ntroscopy (0.2950 to 1.0998). Intervening absorption line sys-\ntems including absorption by CIV are at z = 0.4069, 0.4830,\n0.8196, and 1.1102. The SNR of the KP spectrum of this\nquasar is not as high as the typically observed object, re-\nsulting in a smaller sample of detected absorbers given the\nrelatively long redshift path observed (\u03b4z = 0.8).\nBergeron & Boisse (1991) reported an emission line\ngalaxy at z=0.791 in the LOS to PKS 2145+06, which was\nlater identified as being associated with an extensive metal\nline systems in the FOS UV spectrum obtained by the KP\n(Bergeron et al. 1994). This z = 0.791 system is high enough\ncolumn density to produce a Lyman limit system starting\nat 1633A\u02da , preventing the observation of Ly-\u03b1 absorption\nalong this LOS below z\u223c0.3.\n2.3 Imaging\nTo compare the distribution of the galaxies along the same\nLOS that the FOS spectroscopy maps the gas distribution\nrequires knowledge of the positions and redshifts of galax-\nies in the fields of our quasar sample. Images of the quasar\nfields can provide the positions and magnitudes of the galax-\nies. The spectroscopy that allows the determination of the\ngalaxy redshifts requires the imaging catalogue as input for\nthe design of multi-slit masks.\nFor the CFHT MOS, the images used to generate the\nmulti-slit mask designs are obtained during the same ob-\nserving block as the spectroscopy (i.e., the instrument has\nnot been removed from the telescope between the imag-\ning and spectroscopy observations). Therefore we obtained\nimages for our fields during our two observing runs. The\nimages were reduced shortly after they were obtained and\ncatalogues of galaxies generated to guide the design of the\nmulti-slit masks. After the observing runs were completed,\nthe images were re-reduced, the photometry and astrome-\ntry of the images calibrated, and final catalogues were con-\nstructed. Since the main purpose of the scheduled observing\ntime was to perform the spectroscopy, only R\u2212band images\ndeep enough to detect the galaxies we wished to target for\nspectroscopy were obtained. It would be desirable to obtain\nimages including additional band-passes and with enough\nphotometric standard observations to improve the accuracy\nof our photometry.\nIn the following subsections we describe the imaging\nobservations, the astrometric and photometric calibration of\nthe images, and the measurement of the galaxy positions and\nR\u2212band magnitudes in the fields of our targeted quasars.\n2.3.1 Observing\nWe had two observing runs with CFHT MOS (July 29 -\nAugust 1, 1995 UT and November 29 - December 3, 1997\nUT). The date each field was imaged is listed in Table 2. The\ninstrument and telescope properties were significantly differ-\nent during the two runs and we will describe the particulars\nby run.\nDuring the 1995 observing run, the 29th of July UT\nwas photometric and 600 second R\u2212band exposures were\nobtained of six quasar fields. Two and 10 second exposures\nof the photometric standard stars in the field of NGC 7790\nOdewahn et al. (1992) were also obtained to allow a pho-\ntometric zero-point to be determined for the images. Un-\nfortunately, the proper baffles were left off of the telescope\nwhen MOS was installed on the telescope prior to our run.\nAs a result, bright arcs of light, produced by stars outside\nof the FOV, cut across the images and effectively increased\nthe sky level over approximately one third of the FOV of the\nimages. The amount and distribution of the scattered light\nwas, naturally, pointing dependent. The mixture of sharp\nand diffuse features in the scattered light made it difficult\nto completely remove during the processing of the images.\nThis complicated the determination of the sky background\naround objects, and the subsequent generation of the galaxy\ncatalogues necessary for the construction of the multi-slit\nmasks. The two most strongly affected images were those of\nLBQS 0107\u2212025AB and PG 1718+481. To increase the area\nthat could be mapped for galaxies, we obtained two addi-\ntional images of each field, each offset in position from the\nothers, and combined the images of each field after masking\nthe regions with the worst scattered light in each of the expo-\nsures. The combined images allowed us to produce improved\nmeasurements of the galaxies in these fields, but there are\nstill regions in each image where we would not be able to\ndetect galaxies and objects whose measured properties were\nstrongly affected by scattered light. The imaging on 30 and\n31 July 1995 UT was not done under photometric condi-\ntions, so the flux zero-point for the combined image was set\nto match the imaging on the 29th. The CCD in MOS during\nthis run was the Loral-3 with pixels of approximately 0.313\u2032\u2032\nin size and a gain of 1.9 electrons per ADU.\nDuring the 1997 observing run, the 29th of Novem-\nber UT was photometric and 600 second exposures of four\nquasar fields were obtained. Two and 10 second exposures\nof the photometric standard stars in the field of NGC 7790\nwere also obtained. The correct baffles were on the tele-\nscope. The nights of UT 26 Nov, 30 Nov, and 1 Dec, during\nwhich 600 second exposures of 5 additional quasar fields\nwere obtained, were not photometric. For two of the fields\ntaken during these nights, two 600 exposures were obtained\nto compensate. The CCD in MOS during this run was the\nSTIS-2 with pixels of approximately 0.44\u2032\u2032 in size and a gain\nof 4.52 electrons per ADU.\n2.3.2 Reductions\nThe images were reduced and analysed twice. During the\nobserving run a basic reduction was performed with IRAF2\n(bias subtraction and flat fielding). FOCAS (Valdes 1989)\nwas used to generate a catalogue that could be used for the\nidentification of galaxies and the generation of the multi-\nslit masks. Following the observing runs, the images were\nprocessed in a more relaxed manner, astrometric and pho-\ntometric calibrations were determined, and measurements\nof the object positions and magnitudes completed. In the\n2 IRAF, the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility, is a general\npurpose software system for the reduction and analysis of astro-\nnomical data. It was written and supported by programmers in\nthe Data Products Program of the National Optical Astronomy\nObservatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities\nfor Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement\nwith the National Science Foundation.\n6 Simon L.

Bias subtraction and flat fielding were the main pro-\ncessing steps. While only single exposures were obtained for\nmost fields, effort was made to identify saturated pixels and\ndefects caused by cosmic rays, scattered light, satellite trails,\netc., and to map the locations of affected pixels in a bad\npixel mask for each image. These masks were used during\nthe generation of the catalogues, described below, to flag\nobjects whose properties could not be well measured.\n2.3.3 Astrometry\nIn order to generate relatively accurate positions for the\ngalaxies whose properties are presented in the electronic Ta-\nbles 3-18, we needed to determine for each of the images\nan accurate world coordinate system. This was generated\nusing software in IRAF (tasks ccsetwcs and msccmatch in\nthe mscred package; as described by Valdes (2002)) and the\nUSNO A2.0 catalogue of the positions of objects in each of\nthe fields (Monet et al. 1998). A limited magnitude range\nwas used of USNOA2.0 reference stars in order to avoid the\ndocumented relative offset in astrometry for this catalog as\na function of magnitude. Using the IRAF task msccmatch\n(in v4.7 of the mscred package), a fourth order mapping be-\ntween the images in x,y pixel coordinates to RA and DEC\nof the reference stars was determined. The RMS residuals of\nthe fit were 0.3 to 0.4\u2032\u2032 for each of the images. At the time\nthese solutions were determined, the USNO A2.0 was the\nbest catalogue available. Although catalogues with improved\npositions are now available (e.g. USNO-B1.0, Monet et al.\n(2003) or GSC2.2 3), a trial new solution using the USNO-\n3 The Guide Star Catalogue-II is a joint project of the Space\nTelescope Science Institute and the Osservatorio Astronomico\ndi Torino. Space Telescope Science Institute is operated by the\nB1.0 did not result in a significantly improved solution, so\nwe have retained our original fits. The residuals to our so-\nlutions were largest around the border of the images and\nwe suspect that the uncertainties in the positions of objects\naround the edge of each field should probably include an\nadditional 0.1 to 0.2\u2032\u2032 of systematic error. Our measured po-\nsitions of objects given in this paper are in the ICRF and\nJ2000.\n2.3.4 Photometry and Catalogue Generation\nWe did not obtain multiple standard star observations nor\nobserve in a range of colours that would allow us to de-\ntermine our own extinction solutions and colour terms. This\nfundamentally limits the accuracy we can obtain in our pho-\ntometry. However, our needs in the current study only re-\nquire photometry accurate to a few tenths of a magnitude.\nUsing a representative Mauna Kea extinction curve deter-\nmined from photometric observations during other runs and\nour observations of the stars in NGC 7790, which have been\ncalibrated in theR\u2212band by Odewahn et al. (1992), we were\nable to determine zero points for the 10 fields imaged during\nour photometric nights.\nThere were five fields observed only on non-photometric\nnights. We have determined an approximate zero-point for\nthese images as follows. First, for the 10 fields we calibrated\nwith our measurements of NGC 7790, we compared our mea-\nsured magnitudes to the red magnitudes of the GSC2.2 for\nobjects in common. The pass-bands, of course, are not the\nsame, and we would not expect the magnitudes to be iden-\ntical, but we were gratified that all of the fields observed\nunder what we believe to have been photometric conditions\nyielded similar offsets (mean offset of 0.1 of a magnitude)\nand RMS residuals (0.15 to 0.25). We then assigned to each\nof the five fields (all from the 1997 run) observed on non-\nphotometric nights a zero-point based on the calibration de-\ntermined from the photometric night of that run. We then\ncompared these five fields to the GSC2.0. Two of the fields,\n3C 57 and PKS 2340\u2212036, had mean differences in the same\nrange as those fields observed under photometric conditions.\nThree of the fields; NGC 2841 UB3, 4C 41.21, and PKS\n2344+09; had significantly larger initial offsets (0.43, 0.47,\nand 0.62 magnitudes). The RMS residuals, however, were\nsimilar to those of all the other fields. We therefore adjusted\nthe zero-points for these fields so that their mean offset when\ncompared to the GSC2.0 stars would also be 0.1 of a mag-\nnitude. This adjustment is consistent with what is evident\nfrom inspecting the images (and number counts), namely\nthat these exposures taken with some clouds did not reach\nthe same depth (in the same exposure time) as our other ex-\nposures. A systematic uncertainty of 0.2 mags should prob-\nably be assigned to our reported magnitudes for observed\nAssociation of Universities for Research in Astronomy, for the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration under contract\nNAS5-26555.

Results for our spectroscopically observed\ngalaxies are included in the electronic Tables 3-18.\nAs previously discussed, for some of our fields scattered\nlight affected our images. Even without these problems, any\ncatalog will suffer increasing incompleteness for galaxies of\nfainter total magnitude and\/or surface brightness. As a test\nof the completeness of our imaging catalogs, artificial galax-\nies were inserted into each image (using the IRAF artdata\ntask) and SExtractor used to attempt to recover the objects.\nWhile not a perfect measure of the robustness of our cat-\nalogs, the 50% completeness limit of our catalogs for each\nquasar field is typically 24.4 (R\u2212band) and greater than 24.0\nfor all fields. The fields most seriously affected by the arcs of\nscattered light could be missing even bright galaxies at the\n5% level, but visual inspection indicates that the fraction is\nlikely to be much smaller.\n2.3.5 Bounded Restframe B-band Magnitude\nWe would like to have well measured luminosities for each\nof the galaxies expressed in a common rest-frame band. Un-\nfortunately, we do not have well measured colours or spec-\ntrophotometry that would allow an accurate determination\nof the over-all spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the\ngalaxies in our sample. This prevents the assignment of the\nproper K\u2212correction for each galaxy in our sample.\nWe can, however, constrain the range of rest frame\nB\u2212band luminosities possible for each galaxy using our\nR\u2212band measurements, the redshifts determined from\nour spectroscopy, and the galaxy SED templates and\nK\u2212corrections of Coleman et al. (1980). For each galaxy we\ndetermined the range of possible K\u2212corrections and intrin-\nsic B\u2212R colours and tabulated the resultant maximum and\nminimum rest-frame B\u2212band magnitudes. These are listed\nfor each galaxy in the electronic Tables 3-18. We assumed\nno evolution or intrinsic extinction. While more involved\nprocedures might, with other data sets, provide probabil-\nity distributions for the rest B\u2212band luminosities of each\ngalaxy, the procedure described above allows us to make the\ngross comparisons between sub-samples that are reasonable\ngiven the other uncertainties in our measurements. In other\nwords, those galaxies that might be the intrinsically more\nluminous are separable from those that could not. The ob-\nserved redshifts and R\u2212band magnitudes are the dominant\nconstraints.\n2.4 MOS Spectroscopy\n2.4.1 Observing\nThe majority of the galaxy redshifts described in this paper\nwere obtained using the CFHT Multi-Object Spectrograph\n(MOS), (Le Fevre et al. 1994), during observing runs in July\n1995 and November 1997. As described above, imaging cat-\nalogs were prepared in real time, from which masks were\ndesigned. For July 1995 the Loral 3 CCD was used along\nwith the O300 grism, yielding roughly 3.5A\u02da per pixel. No\nwavelength blocking filter was used, yielding a wavelength\ncoverage that varied depending on the location of the slit\nwithin the field of view, but reasonable signal-to-noise (S\/N)\nwas generally obtained for wavelengths between 5000 A\u02da and\n9000 A\u02da. For the November 1997 run, the STIS 2 CCD was\nused with the same grating, yielding a dispersion of 5.2A\u02da per\npixel. for both runs, masks were designed with a 1.5\u2032\u2032 slit\nwidth, corresponding to 4.8 pixels in July 1995 and 3.4 pix-\nels in November 1997. Some of the observations were taken\nthrough cloud. A flux standard star was observed in order\nto allow an approximate flux calibration of the data and to\nallow us to remove the instrumental signature, but because\nof the above mentioned cloud, the fluxes recorded could be\nlow.\nSpectroscopic multi-slit masks were designed using the\ngalaxy catalogs generated during the observing run. Slits\nwere assigned to galaxies with a magnitude ranking. Slits\nhad a default length of 10\u2032\u2032 and width of 1.5\u2032\u2032. After this, the\nassignment algorithm checked whether it was possible to add\nfurther objects by sliding slits sideways by a limited amount.\nFinally all slits were expanded in length to fill the array and\nallow better sky subtraction for some objects. Depending\non the galaxy surface density and distribution in the field\nbetween 40 and 47 galaxies had slits assigned to them per\nmask in this manner. Between one and three masks per LOS\nwere taken.\nBecause of the varying conditions mentioned above, the\nredshift success rate for objects which were assigned slits\nvaries from mask to mask. The average success rate was 0.5,\nwith a nadir of 0.07 for a mask taken through thick cloud,\nand a pinnacle of 0.89 for one particularly good mask.\nIt was never our intent to obtain a sample complete to\nany given magnitude, but merely to obtain a statistically\nuseful sample of the galaxies around the LOS. By compar-\ning with the photometric catalog, we can reconstruct our\ncompleteness for each field as a function of magnitude, as\nwill be discussed below.\n2.4.2 Reduction\nThe spectroscopic data reduction using IRAF followed the\nstandard procedure for MOS spectroscopy used for example\nin the CNOC2 project (Yee et al. 2000). The data were bias\nsubtracted and trimmed. If necessary, bad columns were in-\nterpolated over. Repeat exposures of the same mask were\ncombined and cosmic rays removed. Because the spectral\nextraction involves summing over several columns, flat field-\ning to correct for pixel-to-pixel variations in CCD sensitivity\nwas not necessary (and would have added noise). Individual\napertures were then summed to generate 1D spectra, simul-\ntaneously subtracting the sky using adjacent regions along\nthe slit. These spectra were wavelength calibrated using arc\n8 Simon L. Morris and Buell T. Jannuzi\nspectra obtained at the same position on the sky (to min-\nimize the effects of flexure), and the spectra were approxi-\nmately flux calibrated using observations of a standard star\ntaken through the same slit width.\n2.4.3 Redshift Determination\nThe driving goal for the redshift measurements was to ob-\ntain redshifts that could all be placed in the same reference\nframe, in our case heliocentric. To do this, all the galaxy\nredshifts determined in different ways were tied together in\nthe same reference frame, and then this frame was tied to\nthat of the absorption line lists, which were adjusted to the\nheliocentric velocity frame as described by Jannuzi et al.\n1998.\nAll galaxies were cross correlated with two absorption\nline templates using the IRAF XCSAO task. One template\nwas the \u2018fabtemp97\u2019 one which comes with the XCSAO pack-\nage, and the other was a high-quality wide-wavelength cov-\nerage spectrum of the early-type galaxy NGC 4889, kindly\nprovided by B. Oke (private communication, template avail-\nable on request from S. Morris). As usual, the cross corre-\nlation process involved continuum fitting and also filtering\nof high and low Fourier components. Redshifts for emis-\nsion line objects were obtained more interactively using the\nIRAF RVIDLINES task inside the RV package. The results\nof these routines were then checked by eye, and each mea-\nsurement flagged as successful or failed. This somewhat sub-\njective procedure was necessary in order to deal with the\ncombined effects of zero order contamination, poor sky sub-\ntraction, residual cosmic rays and other reduction problems.\nIn practice, for the cross correlation measurements, there\nwas a fairly clear threshold in R-value reported by the rou-\ntine above which between measurement were judged success-\nful. Despite all of the above, it is still of course possible for\nsome objects in our redshift catalog to have \u2018catastrophic\u2019\nredshift errors (i.e. redshifts based on spurious features of\nmis-identified features). We believe that the above proce-\ndure should have minimized the number of such errors, and\nwould be surprised if there were more than a handful these in\nthe redshift catalog, but it should be noted that the redshift\nerrors do not take account of this possibility.\nBoth the above routines automatically convert redshifts\nto a heliocentric frame. Nevertheless, as is well known, this\ndoes not mean that there are no systematic shifts in veloc-\nity introduced by the different processes, and so objects with\nreliable redshifts determined from 2 or more of the above ap-\nproaches were used to measure and remove any such shifts.\n(Shifts of -49 km s\u22121 and +72 km s\u22121 were measured for\nthe NGC 4889 and emission line redshifts relative to the\nfabtemp97 measurements).\nAt this stage we are left with 641 galaxy redshifts in\nour catalog with their associated redshift errors. The success\nrate of obtaining redshifts from a given number of slits on a\nmask varied considerably depending on conditions and the\nmagnitude range of objects on the masks, but for typical\nmasks and conditions was around 60-70%.\nAs described above, the photometry performed on the\nmountain for mask design was repeated after the observing\nrun. The resulting photometric catalog was then re-matched\nwith the redshift catalog, resulting in our dropping two of\nour measured objects because of large uncertainties in their\npositions and magnitudes. The CFHT MOS data therefore\nprovided 639 new redshifts of galaxies in the targeted LOS.\nThe objects with identified redshifts are listed in a set\nof Tables (3-18) available in the electronic version of the\npaper. The columns in the associated electronic table are as\nfollows:\n(i) RA: The J2000 Right ascension of the galaxy. The\nrelative positions for galaxies in a single quasar field should\nbe good to a few tenths of an arcsecond.\n(ii) DEC: The J2000 Declination of the galaxy. The rela-\ntive positions for galaxies in a single quasar field should be\ngood to a few tenths of an arcsecond.\n(iii) z: The redshift determined from our MOS spectrum\nof the galaxy.\n(iv) zerr: this is the error reported by the cross correlation\nroutine, and as such should be considered a lower limit on\nthe redshift error.\n(v) R-mag: R-band apparent magnitude (MAG BEST\nfrom Sextractor). As discussed above, these are only accu-\nrate to \u00b10.2 magnitudes.\n(vi) Bmax: estimate of the maximum rest frame B band\nluminosity as discussed in \u00a7 2.3.5\n(vii) Bmin: estimate of the maximum rest frame B band\nluminosity as discussed in \u00a7 2.3.5\n2.5 Additional Galaxy Redshifts\nWe also searched the literature to find additional galaxies\nwith measured redshifts around the sample QSO LOS. As\nthe typical redshift range for the SDSS and 2dF galaxy red-\nshift samples are not well matched to absorption line data\nused in this paper, we have not chosen to add in galaxies\nfrom those surveys at this stage.\nOur main method for finding additional redshifts was\nthrough the NED database4. We list the results of this search\nbelow. Since the analysis in this paper is statistical in nature,\nwe have chosen only to add redshifts from other authors to\nour sample when they make a significant difference to the\nnumber of redshifts known for a given LOS.\n2.5.1 PKS 0122\u221200\nGalaxies in this LOS were observed by both Bowen et al.\n(1997), and Chen et al. (2001), but as only two additional\ngalaxy redshifts would have been added to the sample, for\nsimplicity these were not included. For the three galaxies in\ncommon between our sample and that in Chen et al. (2001)\na mean velocity difference of 30 km s\u22121 is measured, with\nan RMS of 450 km s\u22121 .\n2.5.2 PKS 2145+06\nA galaxy that seems to be associated with a MgII absorber\nat z\u223c0.79 in the LOS has been studied in a number of\npapers, e.g. (Churchill et al. 2000a,b). This galaxy has not\nbeen added to the sample.\n4 This research has made use of the NASA\/IPAC Extragalactic\nDatabase (NED) which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Lab-\noratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract with\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\nThe association between gas and galaxies 9\nTable 3.

(2001), obtaining\nspectra for 24 objects. In this same field, we measured red-\nshifts for 42 objects. We had 6 galaxies in common. (For\nwhich we measure a reassuringly small mean velocity shift\nof -65 km s\u22121 with RMS 227 km s\u22121 , in line with our error\nestimates). This then gives us 18 additional redshifts which\nwe add to our sample. These objects are included in (the\nelectronic) Table 16. On a less positive note, it is interesting\nthat 2 groups designing masks for the same LOS could end\nup with so little overlap in their samples.\n2.5.4 Q0107\u2212025A,B\nThe region around the LOS to the QSO pair\nQ0107-025A,B was also observed with the COS-\nMIC spectrograph on the Palomar 5m telescope\n(http:\/\/www.astro.caltech.edu\/palomar\/200inch\/cosmic\/)\nby Weymann et al. (private communication). The measured\nredshifts for one of the masks observed was kindly made\navailable to us by M. Rauche. This yielded 28 additional\nobjects with redshifts. In this case there was no overlap by\ndesign, and so we are assuming that any systematic shifts\nbetween the two redshift sets is small. These objects are\nincluded in (the electronic) Table 4.\n10 Simon L. Morris and Buell T. Jannuzi\nFigure 2. Pie diagram showing absorbers and galaxies in the\nLOS of NAB 0024+22.

The\nsolid line shows Ly-\u03b1 lines, while the dotted line shows CIV.\n3 ANALYSIS\n3.1 Sample Properties\nThe final galaxy sample as described in \u00a7 2 above contains\n685 objects with redshifts. Of these, 49 have \u2018redshifts\u2019 less\nthan 500 km s\u22121, and hence are almost certainly stars. As-\nsuming this to be true, we can check that our redshift error\nestimates are reasonable. The mean velocity of this sample\nis 5 km s\u22121, with RMS 190 km s\u22121. The mean of the er-\nror estimates on the velocities is 230 km s\u22121, suggesting we\nmight be slightly overestimating our velocity errors, but, to\nbe conservative, we make no adjustment for this.\nThe absorber sample as described in \u00a7 2 above contains\n815 lines, of which 381 are identified as Ly-\u03b1 and 54 are\nCIV. Of the CIV sample, there are 25 with unique redshifts\nless than one (i.e. counting doublets as one system). For our\npresent analysis we will restrict ourselves to this subsample\nof 406 absorption lines.\nThe final redshift distribution of this absorption line\nsample is shown in Figure 18. The dramatic drop in line\nnumbers shortward of z\u223c0.35 is where Ly-\u03b1 moves below\nthe blue edge of the HST FOS G190H grating. In our sub-\nsample, absorption line systems at redshifts less than 0.35\nare generally either metal line systems, or Ly-\u03b1 detected in\na GHRS exposure towards LBQS0107-025A or B.\nThe final redshift distribution of the galaxies with mea-\nsured redshifts is shown in Figure 19.\nIn Figure 20 we show the distribution of the galaxy sam-\nple with projected distance to the QSO LOS in our adopted\ncosmology. There are relatively few galaxies within 200 kpc\nof the LOS (as would be expected for a uniformly sampled\ndistribution). The survey geometry, combined with cosmol-\nogy, results in a fairly flat distribution out to radial distances\nof \u223c1 Mpc, with a drop off from there out to 2 Mpc which\neffectively defines the corners of our surveyed volume.\nIn Figure 21 we show a pie diagram resulting from com-\nbining all of the LOS. This figure should allow the reader to\nunderstand our survey geometry and the regime over which\nour statistical results apply. In particular one can clearly\nsee that our survey covers impact parameters out to 2 Mpc\nfor redshifts above 0.45. One can also see that (because the\nKP observations did not include wavelengths shortward of\nFigure 19. Galaxy Sample Redshift distribution\nFigure 20. Galaxy Sample distribution in projected distance to\nQSO LOS\n1630A\u02da) very few absorber-galaxy pairs are found with red-\nshift less than 0.34. All symbols and lines are as defined for\nFigure 2.\nBy comparing the galaxy sample with measured red-\nshifts with the photometric catalogs, we can compute the\ncompleteness as a function of magnitude for each field in-\ndividually. Because of the fairly small number statistics of\nindividual fields, these histograms look fairly noisy, although\ninformative. For this paper, we show the merged result from\ncombining all of the fields. As can be seen in Figure 22, the\naverage completeness peaks at around 60% at the bright\nend, falling smoothly to 20% at R\u223c20 and 10% at R\u223c21.\nThis completeness can be taken as roughly referring to the\nvolume enclosed by the solid line in the bottom panel of\nFigure 21.\n3.2 Identifying \u2018Absorber-Galaxy pairs\u2019\nThere are two reasons for trying to identify absorber-galaxy\n\u2018pairs\u2019. One is to investigate the physical relationship (if any)\nbetween the gas and the galaxies, while the other is to allow\nus to try to tie the velocities of the galaxies to the frame of\nthe absorbers.\nThe association between gas and galaxies 19\nFigure 21. Pie plot showing all Lines of Sight overplotted. De-\nscription of figure as per figure 2. The solid curve in the lower\npanel shows the outer boundary of the survey volume. Also clearly\nvisible is the sharp drop in absorber-galaxy pairs which could be\nfound produced by the blue edge of the FOS G190H (correspond-\ning to a redshift of 0.34 for Ly-\u03b1 )\nA straightforward way of tying galaxies to absorbers is\nto set limits in impact parameter and velocity difference,\nand to call all galaxies within that distance of an absorber\n\u2018associated\u2019. This begs the question of what to do when there\nis more than one galaxy within this distance of an absorber,\nwith common approaches being to just take the closest, as\ndefined by some metric combining the velocity difference and\nprojected distance, or to accept all such pairs.\nA more complex approach has been followed by the se-\nries of papers by Lanzetta and Chen (Lanzetta et al. 1995,\n1996; Chen et al. 1998; Ortiz-Gil et al. 1999; Chen et al.\n2001), who identify \u2018physical\u2019 absorber-galaxy pairs by sep-\narating them from \u2018random\u2019 and \u2018correlated\u2019 pairs in the fol-\nlowing manner. \u2018Random\u2019 pairs are removed by calculating\nthe value of the absorber-galaxy correlation function assum-\ning a parametric form (kindly provided to us by Hsiao-Wen\nFigure 22. Galaxy sample completeness\nChen), given the impact parameter and velocity difference\n(Lanzetta et al. 1998). Pairs are passed to the next stage\nif their calculated correlation amplitude is greater than 1.\nTo remove \u2018correlated\u2019 pairs they also then require that the\nimpact parameter is less than 200 h\u22121 kpc (286 kpc in our\nadopted cosmology). Given the form of the correlation func-\ntion, and the above additional cut, one can calculate the\nregion of impact parameter\/velocity difference space within\nwhich an absorber-galaxy pair would be declared \u2018physical\u2019.\nWe note that this is in practice extremely similar to a simple\ncut at impact parameter of 286 kpc and velocity difference\nof 530 km s\u22121 .\nAnother route to the above pairing was discussed by\nMorris et al. (1993), where the three dimensional distance\nbetween absorbers and galaxies was corrected for the sta-\ntistical fact that objects close in projected distance might\nhave relatively large peculiar motions relative to each other\nbecause they are orbiting in the same potential well. As\ndiscussed in that paper, it is possible to use the two point\ncorrelation function to estimate the probability distribution\nof the real three dimensional separation of two objects, and\nthen to adopt the expectation value of this probability dis-\ntribution as what was referred to as the \u2018perturbed Hubble\nflow\u2019 distance.\nFor simplicity we will only adopt straight cuts in impact\nparameter and velocity difference (shown for example in Fig-\nure 24), along with the Lanzetta et al. correlation function\napproach, in this paper.\n3.3 Properties of < 286 kpc. \u2018Absorber-Galaxy\npairs\u2019\nIn order to compare our results with those of Chen et al.\n(2001), we have produced pair samples using their approach,\nand also with cuts in impact parameter 286 kpc and veloc-\nity difference \u00b1530 km s\u22121 (the region enclosed by dashed\nlines in Figure 24). For our sample, these two approaches\nproduce identical lists of 13 absorber-galaxy pairs. Given\nour fairly large sample of Ly-\u03b1 absorption lines and galaxies\nwith redshifts, this small number of \u2018physical\u2019 pairs might\nbe seen as surprising, but we re-emphasize that our strategy\nin designing the galaxy redshift survey was not to identify\nthe galaxies \u2018causing\u2019 the absorption, but to obtain a sta-\n20 Simon L. Morris and Buell T. Jannuzi\nFigure 23. Relationship between Equivalent width and impact\nparameter for pairs of absorbers seen in Ly-\u03b1 and galaxies selected\nas described in the text. Small circles show the data of Chen et al.\n(2001), while larger squares show the new pairs from this paper.\nAlso marked are the fiducial EW of 0.3A\u02da and impact parameter\nof 257 kpc (see text)\ntistically well-understood sample of galaxies over a region\nlarge in impact parameter. For this reason we did not try to\nconcentrate our efforts at small impact parameters. Indeed,\nthis would have been a rather inefficient use of telescope\ntime and MOS spectrograph real-estate.\nChen et al. (2001) use their sample of 34 galaxy-\nabsorber pairs to conclude that L* galaxies have tenuous\ngaseous halos of column density >1014 cm\u22122, with radius\n180 h\u22121 kpc and covering factor near unity, and that the\nhalo radius scales with galaxy B-band luminosity as L0.39B .\nTheir Figures 3 and 4 make the case for this conclusion. In\nFigure 23 we show a reproduction of their Figure 3 (con-\nverted to our adopted cosmology) along with the additional\npairs from our sample. Also marked are the fiducial EW of\n0.3A\u02da (corresponding roughly to a column density of 1014\ncm\u22122) and the L* impact parameter of 257 kpc (180 h\u22121\nkpc with h=0.7).\nIn response to an interesting question from the referee\nof this paper, we have investigated the sub-sample of pairs\nfound with large rest EW (taken to mean larger than 1A\u02da)\nand large impact parameter (taken to mean larger than 100\nkpc). There are 5 such pairs in our sample. With such a\nsmall sample, it is impossible to draw any statistically con-\nvincing conclusions, but it is notable that all 5 galaxies so\nidentified have at least one other galaxy close to it in red-\nshift. The clearest example is the absorber galaxy pair in the\nPG 2302+029 LOS at redshift 0.59 where there is a clear\ngroup or wall of galaxies at this redshift (see Figure 13).\nOne possible inference, which could only be confirmed with\na much larger sample, would be that large EW, large im-\npact parameter \u2018pairs\u2019 are identified in somewhat overdense\nregions.\nThe additional pairs from our sample do significantly\nincrease the number of large column density pairs with sep-\narations larger than 100 kpc, but the incomplete nature\nof our sample (and indeed of most samples of this nature)\ndoes leave open the possibility that a galaxy of comparable\nbrightness might be found closer to the LOS.\nWe also looked at the rest frame B-band luminosities\nof the galaxies that are paired in this manner, finding that\nthese were not significantly different from the luminosities of\nall the galaxies found in pairs with separation up to \u00b15000\nkm s\u22121 and impact parameter up to 2 Mpc. I.e. there is\nno evidence from our sample that more luminous galaxies\nare more likely to be found in absorber-galaxy pairs. How-\never, the large uncertainties in the derived absolute B-band\nmagnitudes we tabulate, that results largely from an uncer-\ntain k-correction, mean that any such trend, even if present,\ncould be undetectable using the data in this paper.\nAs a result of these inconclusive results, we have cho-\nsen to abandon the approach of trying to identify a single\n\u2018physical\u2019 galaxy-absorber pair, and in the next section will\nconcentrate on the statistical properties of all the galaxy-\nabsorber pairs within a fairly generous window.\n3.4 Properties of All Absorber\u2212Galaxy Pairs\nwith velocity difference less than 1000 km s\u22121\nWe can now analyse the statistical properties of the relative\ndistributions of the gas and galaxies along the 16 lines of\nsight. The basic sample we will use will be taken from all\npossible pairs of absorbers and galaxies with velocity differ-\nences less than +\/- 5000 km s\u22121 . For the CIV systems we\nhave only taken the stronger line of the doublet. We note\nthat therefore individual absorbers or galaxies can appear\nmultiple time as different pairs. The entire sample is shown\nin Figure 24. This complicated plot shows both the regions\nwe have determined to contain an excess of absorber-galaxy\n\u2018pairs\u2019, and also a region beyond +\/- 1000 km s\u22121 which\nwe will use to determine the \u2018background\u2019 value for random\npairings. Our sample is large enough to break into bins of\nimpact parameter (shown divided by horizontal lines in the\nfigure). We also measure absorber-galaxy pair over-densities\nfor three different velocity ranges +\/- 200, 500 and 1000 km\ns\u22121 . We show the illustrative box at impact parameter of\n286 kpc and velocity difference of 530 km s\u22121 which approx-\nimates the region selected by Lanzetta et al. (1995, 1996);\nChen et al. (1998); Ortiz-Gil et al. (1999) and Chen et al.\n(2001) as containing physical pairs.\nIn Figure 25 we show the above data projected onto\nthe x-axis and displayed as a histogram. We also show the\nmean background values for the Ly-\u03b1 and CIV samples. Two\nthing can be readily seen from this figure. First that there is\na strong over-density of pairswith a small velocity difference\nin both Ly-\u03b1 and CIV, and secondly that the velocity differ-\nences seen in CIV are somewhat smaller than those seen in\nthe Ly-\u03b1 . The RMS of the velocity differences between all\nabsorber-galaxy pairs seen in Ly-\u03b1 with velocity difference\nbetween \u00b11000 km s\u22121 is 440 km s\u22121 (191 pairs), while the\nRMS for absorber-galaxy pairs seen in CIV with velocity\ndifference between \u00b11000 km s\u22121 is 350 km s\u22121 (31 pairs).\nWe also show in Figure 26 how the pairs in the two\nother plots are distributed in redshift. As a result of the\nwavelength coverage of the FOS spectra providing our ab-\nsorption line sample, there is a clear break in the sample at\nz=0.29. For the following analysis we will consider both the\nwhole sample, and also just the pairs with z>0.29 to check\nwhether the results are being affected by the low redshift\nThe association between gas and galaxies 21\nFigure 24. Distribution of velocity differences and impact pa-\nrameter between absorbers seen in Ly-\u03b1 or CIV and galaxies se-\nlected as described in the text.

In order to measure the latter, we consider the\nnumbers of pairs seen in the various bins in impact param-\neter and velocity difference in Figure 24 to be drawn from\na Poisson distribution with an expected mean given by the\n\u2018background\u2019 density measured at the same range of impact\nparameter but with velocity differences between -5000 and\n-1000 km s\u22121 and between +1000 and +5000 km s\u22121 . The\nresults of the analysis are shown in Figures 27, 28, 29, and\n30.\nIn Figures 27 and 28 we show that (as expected by a\nvisual inspection of Figure 24) there is a substantial over-\ndensity of absorber-galaxy pairs at impact parameters less\nthan 500 kpc. The fractional over-density is larger for the\nFigure 26. Distribution of redshift and impact parameter for\nabsorber-galaxy pairs.

At larger\nimpact parameters, the fractional over-density is less. It is\nreasonable that the strength of the over-density generally\ndrops as one increases the velocity difference range within\nwhich one counts pairs.\nIn Figures 29 and 30 we show that the over-densities no-\ntable in Figures 27 and 28 have a <1% probability of arising\nby chance out to impact parameters of at least 1.5 Mpc. This\nis consistent, for example, with the models of Dave\u00b4 et al.\n(1999). Figure 18 in that paper for example shows corre-\nlations in absorber-galaxy properties out to these sorts of\nscales.\nNote that the probabilities reported assume that the\nexpected (or background) value is known perfectly. In prac-\ntice there is a (Poisson) error on our measurement of this\nbackground, which could be folded in to the analysis, but\nhas not been in order to avoid overly complicated plots.\nFigure 31. Distribution of velocity difference and impact pa-\nrameter between galaxies and galaxies selected as described in\nthe text.\nAs noted in \u00a7 2.2, the identifications of the lines in the\nPG 1718+481 LOS are not complete. We have rerun the\nabove statistical tests including all the unidentified lines as\nLy-\u03b1 and find that this makes no significant difference to\nthe results reported in this section.\nWe also remind the reader that the FOS spectral reso-\nlution of 230 km s\u22121 means that no pairs of absorption fea-\ntures can be identified with velocity difference smaller than\nthis. The low density of Ly-\u03b1 absorbers at these redshifts\nmake the likelihood of two such lines coinciding by chance\nlow, although clustering can obviously change this conclu-\nsion. This issue is discussed in more detail in Jannuzi et al.\n(1998). We also note that the galaxy redshift uncertainties\n(also of 230 km s\u22121 ) will artificially move galaxies across\nthe boundaries of any velocity difference cut. The general\ntrend will be (a) to weaken any measured correlation, and\n(b) for this weakening to be stronger for the smaller velocity\ndifference bins.\nAn obvious question is whether the observed results are\nsimply due to the absorbing gas being in the halo of a galaxy,\nand the detected pair excess being due to the galaxy-galaxy\ncorrelation function. This is tested using the galaxy sample\nand forming a similar sample of galaxy-galaxy pairs to the\nabsorber-galaxy pairs. In order to approximately match the\nabsorber galaxy sample, we choose galaxies from each field\nwithin 500 kpc of the QSO LOS, and collect up all resulting\npairs with that sample. This subsample should then be able\nto find pairs in the same volume of space as the absorber\nsample. Figures 31 and 32 are the equivalent of Figures 24\nand 26 but for the galaxy-galaxy pairs. The over-densities\nfound for galaxy-galaxy pairs were plotted in Figures 27 and\n28.\nThe above analysis shows that the galaxy-galaxy pair\nover-density is significantly higher than the absorber-galaxy\npair over-density seen for the Ly-\u03b1 systems, but compara-\nble to that seen for the absorber systems seen in CIV. This\nresult could have several interpretations, but one might be\nthat the absorbing gas seen in CIV (and which has obviously\nbeen polluted by outflows from galaxies) is still in close prox-\nimity with galaxies, while systems seen in Ly-\u03b1 are more\nwidely distributed, albeit still correlated with the galaxy\nThe association between gas and galaxies 23\nFigure 32. Distribution of redshift and impact parameter be-\ntween galaxies and galaxies selected as described in the text.\ndistribution.5 Another possible interpretation is that we are\njust seeing the column density correlation with impact pa-\nrameter noted by other authors and modelled for example\nby Dave\u00b4 et al. (1999). Separating hydrogen column density\nfrom metallicity as the underlying driver of these correla-\ntions needs further work and will benefit from higher resolu-\ntion UV spectroscopy (i.e. data from the HST archive taken\nwith the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS)).\n3.5 The link to simulations and theory\nOne of the many benefits provided by the powerful cosmo-\nlogical simulations begun in the 1990s and continuing into\nthe present (see introduction for list of references), is the\nability to simulate the evolution of the physical properties\nof Ly-\u03b1 absorbers as a function of redshift and cosmic time.\nThis helps tremendously when trying to make use of diverse\nobservational data sets in order to understand what physi-\ncal processes influence the physical properties and evolution\nof the IGM and galaxies. The theoretical models aid us in\nidentifying the high redshift progenitors of structures ob-\nserved at low redshift. For example, it is from such models\n(e.g. Dave\u00b4 et al. (1999); Schaye (2001)) that we understand\nthat a given relative over-density in the (dark) matter dis-\ntribution will be associated with a different column density\n5 When this paper was near to submission, an interesting short\nletter appeared on astro-ph by Chen et al. (2005) describing a sin-\ngle LOS with high quality STIS UV spectroscopy. They perform\na correlation analysis with a sample of 61 galaxies within 1 h\u22121\nMpc at redshifts less than 0.5. Some of their conclusions will need\nconfirmation with a greater number of LOS and a larger galaxy\nsample, but their conclusion that the absorber-galaxy correlation\nis entirely due to the emission line (i.e. star forming) galaxies is\npotentially very exciting. If confirmed, then this would support a\nseductively simplistic model with star forming galaxies and high\ncolumn density absorbing gas co-existing in the filamentary struc-\nture now so familiar from the simulations, while the more highly\nclustered absorption line galaxies lie in the knots and intersec-\ntions where the 104 K gas needed for detection in Ly-\u03b1 is absent\nor destroyed (possibly by conversion into the much sought after\nWHIM). Our data set can be used to look for confirmation of this\npicture.\nof neutral hydrogen as a function of redshift. Ly-\u03b1 absorbers\nwith NH I approximately 10\n14 cm\u22122 at z = 0 are in regions of\nover-density that at z = 3 would have neutral gas columns\ncloser to 1016 cm\u22122 (Dave\u00b4 et al. 1999). We note that this\ndoes not imply that regions of neutral column density 1016\ncm\u22122 at z=3 evolve into regions with neutral column den-\nsity 1014 cm\u22122 at z=0, but merely that these two different\ncolumn densities of neutral material flag regions at those\ntwo epochs with the same dark matter overdensity.\nA natural next step for this work will be to compare\nthe statistics we have derived from our observations with\nstatistics measured as close as possibly identically on sim-\nulations which include feedback, with a goal of verifying or\nruling out the feedback assumptions they have made. This\nis a challenging project, as the simulation must faithfully in-\nclude both low density inter-galactic gas, and also accurately\npredict the locations and physical properties (stellar lumi-\nnosities and star formation histories) of the highly-collapsed\ngalaxies. The redshift range from z=1 to the present day\nis well known to be hard to model at high resolution, be-\ncause of the large dynamic range needed. That said, several\nof the references to modelling work given in the introduction\nsuggest that this problem is tractable.\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nA goal of our work is an improved understanding of how gas\nis transformed into galaxies, and how those galaxies in turn\ninfluence the gas around them (e.g. by winds, jets or radi-\nation). Studies of absorbers and galaxies at high redshift\nhave already yielded evidence for such mechanisms play-\ning a role in the formation and evolution of galaxies (e.g.\nAdelberger et al. (2003); Croft et al. (2002); Frank et al.\n(2003); Bruscoli et al. (2003) and Kollmeier et al. (2003)).\nWe have focussed on the second half of the history of the\nUniverse, i.e. at redshifts less than one. This is a period in\nwhich the star formation density of the Universe is thought\nto be dropping away from its peak, the rapid evolution of the\nproperties of the Ly-\u03b1 absorbers has slowed, and when the\nHubble sequence of galaxies is well established. Despite this\napparent middle-aged placidity, there should remain clear\nevidence of the wild excesses of youth, and that is what\nwe claim to have measured. An advantage of focussing on\nthis (large) fraction of the history of the Universe is that\nthe galaxy population can be studied in detail, and with\nconfidence that a representative sample has been obtained.\nThere is evidence from the KP data set alone for cluster-\ning of some fraction of low redshift (z < 1) Ly-\u03b1 absorbers\non velocity scales < 300 km\/sec. This evidence is that ap-\nproximately 10% of the KP Ly-\u03b1 absorbers are \u201cresolved\u201d\nin the FOS spectra (Jannuzi et al. 1998).\nAt higher column densities, the Lyman limit systems\ncontained in the KP sample all have extensive associated\nmetal line systems. For all the extensive metal line systems\n(multiple absorption lines from strong resonance line pro-\nducing species, e.g. Si, O, N, etc.) for which we could check\nfor the presence of an associated Lyman Limit system, we\ndetect such a system. In other words, the absorption line\nsystems that are unambiguously higher column density sys-\ntems (at low redshift) are unquestionably more like the gas\nproducing the ISM of a galaxy than like the gas one might\n24 Simon L. Morris and Buell T. Jannuzi\nexpect in a void. These same absorbers also often have asso-\nciated OVI, or NV, or other evidence of more highly ionized\ncomponents i.e. multi-phase gas again, like a galaxy.\nOur conclusions for the more moderate column density\nsystems that dominate our current sample can be summa-\nrized as:\n\u2022 A correlation between absorbers and galaxies has been\ndetected out to impact parameters of at least 1.5 Mpc.\n\u2022 The strength of the absorber-galaxy correlation is\nweaker than the correlation between galaxies and galaxies.\n\u2022 The velocity differences seen between galaxies and ab-\nsorbers with detected CIV are typically smaller than the ve-\nlocity differences seen between galaxies and absorbers seen\nin Ly-\u03b1 only.\n\u2022 The above is consistent with absorbers being a mixed\npopulation containing some pristine6 material probably in-\nfalling for the first time along the filaments predicted by\ncurrent models, and some contaminated material produced\nby outflows which in general lies closer to galaxies in veloc-\nity.\n\u2022 The above qualitative picture needs to be fleshed out\nby comparing the numerical strengths of the observed cor-\nrelations and relationships with SPH or AMR modelling.\nWhile we have so far only made a fairly superficial anal-\nysis of the (no-doubt complex) relationship between gas and\ngalaxies at redshifts less than one, we feel the above results\nare very encouraging, and that they suggest that there is\nconsiderable room for further observation and modelling of\nthis crucial interaction.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work would not have been possible without many land-\nmark contributions by Professor John Bahcall, who sadly\npassed away as we prepared to submit this paper. Not only\ndid Bahcall anticipate the production of quasar absorption\nlines by gas associated with galaxies and other structures\n(Bahcall & Spitzer 1969), but he indefatigably worked for\nthe development, launch, repair, and continued operation of\nthe Hubble Space Telescope. As PI of the Key Project, he\nled the team that successfully completed the first census of\nabsorbers at low redshift, enabling the present work.\nWe would like to that our anonymous referee who made\na number of suggestions that significantly improved the\nquality of this paper.\nWe thank Ray Weymann for his active participation in\nthe hard work of the observing runs that produced the data\npresented in this work and for many relevant conversations.\nWe also thank the CFHT telescope operators.
