The resonance behaviour of such a structure results in a band-\npass filter response, having a band-width determined by the frequency separation between the\nclosely spaced in-phase and out-of-phase vibrational modes of the two coupled cantilevers. A\ndetailed configuration design analysis, filter simulation and optimisation of performance is\nundertaken using a new modelling approach combining microwave circuit theory and finite\nelement analysis to evaluate the generalised (A, B, C and D) and scattering (S) circuit parameters\nof the filter. Two significant features of the filters have emerged from the derived analyses and\nsimulations: (1) with correct design filter Q-values can reach several thousand which is much\nhigher than the Q-values (~ 80) of uncoupled cantilevers, (2) the Q-value is determined by the\nconfiguration of the silicon linkage and so is under the designer\u2019s control. The position and\nlength of the linkage that give optimum Q and minimum insertion loss are determined.\nKey words: coupled cantilevers, piezoelectric mechanical filters, microwave circuit, FEA\n21 Introduction\nRF and microwave MEMS components such as switches, varactors, resonators and filters have\nwidespread potential applications in the telecommunications industry because of their superior\nperformance compared to conventional semiconductor devices [1, 2]. One of the particular\nattractions is the possibility of integrating passive components with silicon integrated circuits for\nmobile communications. There has been a great deal of research effort worldwide over the last\ndecade aimed at developing new RF MEMS piezoelectrically actuated components. The most\nnotable recent piezoelectric filter designs are based on the thin film bulk acoustic resonator\n(FBAR) [3], where the resonant frequency is determined mainly by the thickness of the piezo-\nlayer. Since this thickness is fixed during deposition of the piezo-layer, it is difficult to fabricate\nFBARs with multiple frequencies on a single chip [4]. For the device considered in this paper the\nresonant frequency is not only determined by the thickness of the moving element, but also by\nin-plane dimensions which can be easily varied across a wafer. Furthermore, some applications\nrequire high-Q filters with very steep filter skirts but in most cases the Q-value of the filters is\nlimited by the Q of the individual resonators that make up the filter. This paper analyses a new\ntype of filter where the Q-value is mainly determined by the structural configuration. The new\nstructure is composed of two silicon cantilevers having thin film PZT transducers defined on\ntheir top surface which are mechanically coupled by a silicon linkage. Such a coupled cantilever\nsystem exhibits a series of closely spaced in-phase and out-of-phase vibrational modes which\ndefine the filter pass-band.\nSeveral approaches can be used to model miniature mechanical filters, including lumped mass-\nspring [5], equivalent electrical circuit [6], [7], finite element analysis (FEA) [4], [8], [9], and\nacoustic transmission line [10]. Lumped mass-spring modelling does give a deep understanding\n3of structural design but it involves many assumptions and simplifications and so lacks fine\ndetails contained in real structures and therefore, cannot give an accurate prediction of filter\nperformance. An equivalent electrical circuit method provides a practically pleasing analysis tool\nfor the representation of the original system and the design of microelectromechanical resonators\nand filters but it is very difficult to find an equivalent transforming ratio that represents the\nconversion of acoustic\/mechanical energy into electrical energy or vice versa. The representation\nof the piezoelectric micromachined mechanical filter by mass-spring and equivalent circuit\nmodels is hindered by the difficulty in knowing how to represent the finite mass and twisting\nmotion of the mass of the linkage. Furthermore, as the cantilevers are reduced in size and the\nlinkage becomes comparable in size to the resonator beams, the equivalent system approach\nincreasingly fails to give an adequate representation of the structure. The acoustic transmission\nline model which is the mechanical analogy of the familiar electrical transmission line can be\nused to model the effective stiffness of the linkage. However, the development of such a model\nto include the linkage twisting that occurs during operation presents considerable modelling\ndifficulties. FEM is a powerful tool in which an exact structure can be modeled to obtain a\ncomplete description of the motions of the structure. It is therefore and appropriate method for\npredicting the device characteristics of piezoelectric resonators and filters, including the\nelectrical input impedance and mechanical frequency response. However, FEA has not been used\nto predict the overall performance of linked cantilever filters, including such parameters as the\nQ-value, insertion loss (IL) and ripple, possibly because a suitable modelling approach has not\nbeen put forward to date. In this paper, the micro-machined piezoelectrical filter is configured as\na two-port device in an electrical circuit and a combined microwave circuit and FEA modelling\napproach is proposed for the design analysis of the filters and to predict the overall performance.\n4This method is very similar to the black box techniques which identify system transfer functions\napplicable to the modelling of complex systems.\n2 Filter Structure and Operation\nThe micro-machined piezoelectric mechanical filters studied here are shown schematically in\nFigure 1. Two silicon coupled cantilever beams with integrated thin film PZT transducers are\nmechanically connected by a thin silicon linkage so that an incoming electrical signal is first\nconverted to a mechanical signal by the first beam before being converted back to an output\nelectrical signal by the second. The piezoelectric transducers are capacitive structures composed\nof lead zirconate titanate (PbZrxTi1-O3, PZT) films sandwiched between top and bottom\nelectrodes. Such a coupled cantilever system exhibits a series of in-phase and out-of-phase\nvibrational modes, as shown in Figure 1, which are closely spaced in frequency and define the\nfilter pass-band. For the lower frequency mode, both cantilevers vibrate in phase, and for the\nhigher frequency mode, the cantilevers vibrate 180\u25e6 out-of-phase. The efficiency of the electro-\nmechanical transfer between the two cantilevers depends on the configuration of the small\nsilicon linkage between the two cantilevers, particularly its position with respect to the anchors\nof the cantilevers. The frequency of operation of the filter is determined by the dimensions of the\ncantilevers.\n3 Modelling Approach Based on Combined Microwave Circuit and FEA\nA combined microwave circuit [13] and FEA model has been developed for the design of the\nfilters and to predict their performance. A two-port network, shown in Figure 2, represents the\ncoupled cantilevers incorporating the thin film PZT transducers, where End 1 represents the\ninput terminal of one of the cantilevers and End 2 represents the output of the second cantilever.\n22121111 )(,,,and)(,,, inin ZRIVZRIV represent the electrical voltages, currents, source resistances\nand impedances at End 1 and End 2, respectively.\n53.1 Analysis of the two-port network circuit\nThe relationship between the electrical signals at End 1 ),(2Endand),( 2211 IVIV can be written\nin matrix form as;\n\uf0fe\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf02d\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\uf03d\n\uf0fe\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n2\n2\n1\n1\nI\nV\nDC\nBA\nI\nV\n(1)\nwhere Dand,, CBA represent the generalized electrical parameters of the coupled cantilevers,\nand are obtainable from the short-circuit admittances as follows:\n\uf0fe\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0fa\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\uf03d\n\uf0fe\n\uf0fd\n\uf0fc\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n2\n1\n2221\n1211\n2\n1\nV\nV\nyy\nyy\nI\nI\n(2)\nwhere 11y is the admittance at End 1 when End 2 is short-circuited, 12y is the ratio 21 \/VI when\nEnd 1 is shorted-circuited and a voltage 2V is applied at End 2, and 22y is the admittance at End 2\nwhen End 1 is short-circuited.\nFor a reciprocal network and identical cantilevers, the two-port network of the filter is\nsymmetrical so that DA \uf03d and\n2112\n2211\nyy\nyy\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\n(3)\nFurthermore, from Eqs.

Therefore, the dB attenuation for transmission is\n12log20 SIL \uf03d (dB) (10)\n73.2 Determination of admittance using FEA modelling\nIf the parameters, ,and, 221211 yyy are known, then S21 and S11 can be clearly determined using\nEqs. 8 and 9. By definition, ,\n1\n1\n11 V\nI\ny \uf03d\n2\n1\n12 V\nI\ny \uf03d ,and\n2\n2\n22 V\nI\ny \uf03d where\nfQjIfQjI 2211 2and2 \uf070\uf070 \uf02d\uf03d\uf02d\uf03d with Q1 and Q2 being the charges at Ends 1 and 2, and f the\nfrequency. The voltage and charges generated on the top of the input and output electrodes, V2,\nQ1 and Q2, can be determined using FEA harmonic analysis. The electromechanical coupled\nfield analysis option within ANSYS (ANSYS Inc. Canonsburg, PA) was used to perform the 3D\npiezoelectric finite element simulation and to construct the model of the admittances (y11, y12 and\ny22). This 3D model uses the 8-node, hexahedral, coupled-field element SOLID5 for the\npiezoelectric materials and the 8-node, linear, structural element SOLID45 for the non-\npiezoelectric materials. Voltages of 0 and 1V were applied to the top and bottom input\nelectrodes, respectively. Modal and harmonic analyses were performed to determine the series\nand parallel resonance frequencies for the in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational modes. For the\nmodal analyses, short circuit (V1 = 0) and open circuit (Q1 = 0) resonance frequencies fs and fp\n(series and parallel resonance frequencies, respectively) were obtained by solving the\nconstitutive equation subject to the electrical boundary conditions. The harmonic analysis\ndetermines a complete spectrum of series and parallel resonance frequencies in the frequency\nrange of interest. It should be noted that the use of the minima and maxima of the electrical input\nimpedance as a measure of the resonance and anti-resonance frequencies is only valid for a\npiezoelectric material with low loss. However, this method does enable precise visualization of\nthe frequency response of the mechanical filters and is convenient for predicting the filter\nperformance.\n8Furthermore, from the definition\nf\nf\nQ\n\uf044\n\uf03d 0 (11)\nwhere 0f is the centre frequency and f\uf044 is the bandwidth (BW) of the filter, FEA can be used to\ncalculate Q. Eq. (11) is only applicable to second order band-pass mechanical filters or narrow\nBW filters.\n4. Design Analysis\nThe model described in the previous section was used to investigate the effect of changes in\nstructural parameters on filter characteristics and simulations for several substrate thicknesses\nand different linkage position, length and width were performed. The results are shown in\nFigures 4 to 7 and Tables 2 to 5. The material parameters and geometrical dimensions used in the\nsimulations are listed in Table 1 except where specifically mentioned in the text. Since no PZT\nthin film material data were available from the literature, the bulk values listed in Table1 were\nused. The material losses in silicon and PZT were simulated by the use of constant damping\nratios, \u03bes and \u03bep, which are the ratios between the actual damping and critical damping in the\nharmonic analysis. The \u03bes (\u03bep) were obtained from the relationship )\n2\n1\n(\n2\n1\nQ\nps \u03be\u03be\n\uf03d with Q values\nof 105 and 103 used for silicon and PZT, respectively.\n4.1 Comparison of single and coupled cantilever impedances\nIt is interesting to compare the impedance responses of the coupled and single piezoelectric\ncantilevers. Figure 3 shows the calculated impedances and S parameters versus frequency for\nsingle and coupled cantilevers having different linkage positions. The linkage position, ,p is\ndefined as the distance from the anchor of the cantilever to the linkage normalized to the\ncantilever length (L), and the results for p = 0.05L, 0.1L and 0.2L shown in Figure 3. Also shown\n9in figure 3 are the results for a single cantilever which reveal minimum and maximum\nimpedances in the calculated response, designated as the positions of the series and parallel\nresonant frequencies, fs and fp, respectively. Using the expression,\nf\nfQ \uf044\uf03d\n0 where 2\/)(0 sp fff \uf02b\uf03d is the central frequency and sp fff \uf02d\uf03d\uf044 is the BW, the Q of\nthe single piezo-cantilever is about 82. For the coupled cantilever, there are four peaks in the\nimpedance curve, two minima corresponding to the series resonant frequencies (fsi, fso) of the in-\nphase and out-of-phase modes and two maxima corresponding to the parallel resonant\nfrequencies (fpi, fpo) for the same modes. It can be observed that fsi and fpi are closer in frequency\nthan fso and fpo. It follows that the Q-value of the in-phase resonant vibration is higher than that of\nthe out-of-phase vibration for the case where the linkage is close to the anchor. It is worth\nstressing that the pass-band and the Q of the piezoelectric mechanical filter are determined by fsi\nand fso and not by fpi and fpo. The Q, therefore, of this type of filter is determined by the Q of the\nin-phase vibration and so, by adjusting the linkage beam position, filters with a high Q-value\nshould be attainable.\n4.2 Parametric study\nA. Thickness of the substrate\nTable 2 and figure 4 show that the resonant frequency and Q increase with the increase in silicon\nsubstrate thickness (ts) while the insertion loss (IL) decreases. The behaviour of the resonant\nfrequency is straight forward as it is proportional to .3st Q is inversely proportional to the\nelectromechanical coupling constant kt2 but directly proportional to the impedance ratio of the\npiezo-layer to substrate Zp\/Zs. Since both of this decrease with the increase of substrate thickness,\nthe Q would be expected to rise. On the other hand, IL is proportional to kt2 and Zp\/Zs, and so it\nwould be expected to decrease.\n10\nB. Linkage\nB.1 Linkage position\nTable 3 and Figure 5 show that Q values can be as high as 1754 with the linkage close to the\nanchors and as low as 80 when it is away from the anchors (similar to the value obtained for the\nsingle piezo-cantilever). Ripples diminishes as the Q-value increases, reaching a value of 20.5\ndB at p= 0.2L and dropping sharply to 0.06 dB at p=0.05L. In contrast, IL maintains almost the\nsame value for the several simulated linkage positions. Since BW is equal to f0\/Q and Q is a\nfunction of linkage position, the BW of the filter can be set by appropriately positioning the\nlinkage along the main beam without changing its length, width or thickness.\nB.2 Linkage length\nTable 4 and figure 6 reveal that the length of the link beam (l) has a small effect on the in- and\nout-of-phase resonant frequencies but it has a large effect on the Q-values ( these can be as high\nas 3800 for l=1.2L) and on the pass-band ripple (about 0.47 dB for l<0.4L). IL is almost constant\nfor l=0 to 0.6L but starts to rise for l>0.6L. Therefore, IL and ripple can be minimized if the\nlength of the linkage is designed to be between 0.4L and 0.6L.\nB.3. Linkage width\nTable 5 and Figure 7 present the results for different linkage widths (b). The results show that Q\nworsens rapidly as the linkage width is increased and reaches a very low value of 40\nwhen ,1.0 Lb \uf03d while the ripple rises abruptly when b >0.013L. IL initially decreases slightly and\nreaches a minimum value at b=0.013L and then slightly increases for b>0.013L. In order to\nmaximize the Q-value while minimizing the IL and ripple a value for b of 0.013L seems\nreasonable.\n11\nC Discussion\nThe changes in Q due to different linkage dimensions are due to the values of the spring constant\nof the linkage, ,lk and the spring constant of the main cantilevers, rk (the mechanical filter's\nQ\uf0b5 lr kk \/ ). The closer the linkage is to the anchors, the higher are the values of lr kk \/ and this\nexplains why a higher Q is obtained when the position of the linkage is close to the anchors. The\ndependence of the Q on the length and width of the linkage is similarly explained.\nC. 2 Dependence of IL on linkage parameters\nThe various influences of the linkage parameters on IL can be explained in terms of the electrical\nand mechanical energy loss of the structure. For any set of linkage parameters, the IL resulting\nfrom the electrical energy loss is a fixed value so it is only necessary to consider the effect of the\nmechanical energy loss on the filter performance. The change in linkage position does not add\nextra mechanical energy loss to the filter. This is the reason that IL is not affected by the position\nof the linkage. Lengthening the linkage decreases the coupling stiffness of the linkage and hence\nincreases the strain in the linkage somewhat. Since energy loss is proportional to the square of\nthe strain [11], the increase in linkage length leads to a little higher loss of energy. This is a\npossible reason that there is only a small rise in IL when the length increases. For the effect of\nthe linkage width on IL, twisting of the linkage is a possible loss mechanism as in this situation\nthe linkage can only transfer a fraction of the energy between the input and output cantilevers.\nThe IL, therefore, increases gradually with increasing linkage width but has a minimum value for\nb =0.013L. A possible reason is that, the coupling stiffness of the linkage is so low that it cannot\ntransfer mechanical energy from one cantilever to another for b<0.013L.\nC.3 Pass band frequencies of filters\nFrom Figure 3, it can be seen that the frequency span of the pass-band can be either higher or\n12\nlower than the series resonant frequency of the single piezo-cantilever, depending on the design\nof the linkage. The linkage pulls the resonator frequencies apart and creates two closely spaced\nresonance modes which constitute the ends of the filter pass-bands. For a given cantilever\ndimension the characteristics of the mechanical filter, including BW, IL, ripple and Q, are\ndetermined by the linkage.\n4.3 Comparisons between millimetre sized and scaled-down filters\nFigure 8 shows the impedances and S21 parameters for filters with scaled down dimensions. They\nare one tenth of the filter dimensions shown in Table 1 except for the linkage width which has\nthe values m.3andm2\u03bcm,5.1 \uf06d\uf06d Reduced dimensions give resonant frequencies in the MHz\nrange because of the higher stiffness of the structure. For a structure having a higher ratio of the\nresonator stiffness to the linkage stiffness ( lr kk \/ ) a higher Q can be achieved. Because the rk of\nscaled down filters is much higher than that for large scale filters, it is possible to obtain micro\nscale filters with much higher Q if precise micro\/nano processes are available for the fabrication\nof the linkage. On the other hand, for micromechanical filters, the resonators and couplers are\nusually of similar size, and thus, the lr kk \/ ratio is limited, which limits the attainable Q. If a\nclamped-clamped beam is used, higher Q can be obtained since such a structure has a higher\nlr kk \/ ratio than a clamped-free beam with the same dimensions. The reduction in size of the\nfilter results in a higher IL. A possible reason for this higher IL is the increase in the electrical\nimpedance (Z) of the transducer since\nAj\nt\nZ p\n33\uf077\uf065\n\uf03d , where \uf077 is the frequency and A is the\nelectrode area. Therefore, a reduction in area leads to a higher IL if the other parameters are kept\nthe same. If the thickness is decreased along with the reduction in filter area, IL can be\nmaintained at a useful low value.\n13\n5. Conclusions\nA new method for inputting the results of FEA into a microwave circuit has been developed. The\nmethod allows parametric design studies of the performance of micro-machined piezoelectric\ncoupled cantilever mechanical filters. The structural dimensions varied were the thickness of the\nsubstrate and the position, length and width of the linkage. The performance of the filter has been\nsystematically simulated and discussed. It has been observed that the coupled cantilever filter\nstructures have a significant advantage in terms of increased Q. The Q of most filters, such as\nladder and array types, is limited by the Q of the individual resonators from which they are\nconstructed. The results show that the coupling linkage not only produces additional resonances\nbut it is also responsible for a significant increase in the quality factor. Q can be very high, if a\ncorrect design is implemented. This is not achievable in filters with uncoupled cantilevers.\nRegarding the design, the Q value is under the designer's control by a properly configured silicon\nlinkage. The various simulations performed suggest that the optimum design can be achieved for\na linkage position close to the anchor point, with length greater than 0.4L and width fixed at\n0.013L. Additionally, for higher working frequencies, toward the MHz region, the simulated\nresults suggest possibly useful performance from scaled down filters. Such devices impose\nsevere requirements on manufacturing the linkage, highlighting the need for nano-structuring of\nsuch devices.\nAnother important feature of the filters is the use of a bending mode in contrast to the thickness\nmode used in for example FBARs and FBAR filters. This feature makes it possible to fabricate\nRF MEMS components operating at multiple frequencies on one chip and offers the potential for\nhighly integrated RF MEMS.\n14\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was funded by the UK\u2019s Engineering and Physical Science Research Council\n(EPSRC) under Grant No.GR\/N06007 and EU Network of Excellence, Advanced MEMS for RF\nand millimeter Wave Communications (AMICOM).
