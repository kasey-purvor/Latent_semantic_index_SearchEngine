Introduction\n[2] There is increased application of three-dimensional\ncomputational fluid dynamics to natural open channel\nflows, often over quite complex topographies [e.g.,\nHodskinson and Ferguson, 1998; Sinha et al., 1998;\nGessler et al., 1999; Nicholas and Sambrook-Smith,\n1999; Bradbrook et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2000; Booker et\nal., 2001]. The interest in doing this stems from a number\nof reasons. First, research has shown [e.g., Lane et al.,\n2000] that using point measurements of flow velocity to\ninfer reach-scale channel flow processes in 3-D can be\nmisleading. Numerical modeling in 3-D has appeal in this\nrespect. However, both Dietrich [1987] and Bradbrook et\nal. [2000] show that there can be significant deviation\nbetween the results of both experimental and numerical\nmodeling studies of idealized river channels (commonly\nwith rectangular or trapezoidal cross sections) and those of\nreal rivers. Much of this relates to the role of topographic\nforcing, where within-channel topographic variability in\nboth the downstream and cross-stream direction can be as\ninfluential as or dominate over other terms in a classical\nforce balance analysis [e.g., Dietrich, 1987]. Thus under-\nstanding the influence of complex topography upon flow\nprocesses is a crucial goal, and three-dimensional model-\ning using a full topographic representation is a way\nforward. Second, this topographic forcing has important\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0043-1397\/04\/2002WR001934$09.00\nW01302\nWATER RESOURCES RESEARCH, VOL. 40, W01302, doi:10.1029\/2002WR001934, 2004\n1 of 18\nimplications for the nature of sediment transport and river\nchannel change [e.g., Dietrich, 1987]. Bradbrook et al.\n[2000] show how scour at tributary junctions results in\nstrong downwelling, and hence transfer of momentum\ntoward the bed, assisting in the maintenance of channel\nscour. However, in the absence of scour, numerical simu-\nlations suggested that downwelling was significantly\nreduced, causing us to explore different explanations for\nscour hole formation. The richness of the three-dimensional\nflow field associated with three-dimensional numerical\nmodeling, along with the ability to simulate interactions\nbetween different bed topographies and flows [e.g.,\nBradbrook et al., 2001], allows testing of a much wider\nrange of hypotheses over the interaction between river\nchannel form and process. Third, it is clear that the three-\ndimensional flow structure of rivers, especially gravel bed\nrivers exerts a crucial control upon habitat, and its spatial\nvariation. Leclerc et al. [1995, 1996] demonstrate that 2-D\nhydraulic modeling allowed a much better match between\nthe spatial scale of salmonid function and hydraulic pre-\ndictions. Crowder and Diplas [2000] showed that point\nmeasurements of habitat did not represent habitat variation\nin space by using a model that included mesoscale topo-\ngraphic features (e.g., boulders). By scaling the spatial\nchange in kinetic energy between two points by the kinetic\nenergy at the point with the smaller velocity, they were able\nto derive a metric that represents the kinetic energy that\nmust be spent by an organism in order to move from the\npoint of lower velocity to the point of higher velocity. The\npresence of boulders resulted in a substantially more\ncomplex spatial metric which provided a greater habitat\nrange for fish. Linking this to observed fish behavior\n[Crowder and Diplas, 2002] confirmed that boulders en-\nhanced the potential availability of the right habitat. Again,\nobtaining information on the full three-dimensional flow\nfield allows us to start to understand the interaction between\nhabitat and flow hydraulics and so develop much more\nsophisticated analysis of the parameters that describe hab-\nitat availability and their change through time.\n[3] Given the potential of using three-dimensional appli-\ncations of computational fluid dynamics to explore fluvial\nflows and the demonstrated achievement of this method in\ncertain application areas, this paper seeks to address a\nfundamental methodological problem that has yet to be\naddressed. Research into the performance of numerical\ncode is emphasizing, amongst other things, the need for\ncareful investigation of numerical diffusion associated with\ngrid specification, the accuracy of discretization [e.g.,\nManson and Wallis, 1997], and convergence problems\nassociated with fine grids in finite volume discretizations\n[e.g., Cornelius et al., 1999]. Provided attention is given to\nthe way in which the numerical solution achieves conver-\ngence [Cornelius et al., 1999], finite volume treatments\nusing structured grids have particular appeal as they\nprovide a fast and efficient numerical solution and can\nbe numerically stable in channels of simple geometry.\nHowever, two problems emerge. First, in channels of more\ncomplex geometry, where boundary-fitted coordinates\nmust be used, they are much less stable and numerical\ndiffusion can be high. Second, for coupling to sediment\ntransport treatments, erosion or deposition (in a 3-D\nmodel) requires an adaptive gridding capability. Mesh\ngeneration and re-generation associated with this is a\nparticular problem if lateral channel change is involved\n[Lane, 1998]. The aims of this paper are (1) to develop a\nmethod identified by Olsen and Stokseth [1995] for\nrepresenting complex topography in regular structured\ngrids using a porosity treatment; (2) to combine this\nmethod with high-resolution topographic data for a real\nwater-worked gravel bed surface; and (3) to validate model\npredictions using point measurements obtained using\nacoustic Doppler velocimetry.\n2. Background to Approach\n[4] The traditional approach to the treatment of channels\nwith complex geometry involves fitting a mesh to available\ntopographic data and then parameterizing smaller scale\naspects of topography using a roughness parameter [e.g.,\nHodskinson and Ferguson, 1998; Nicholas and Sambrook-\nSmith, 1999; Lane et al., 1999]. In the latter, the skin\nfriction associated with grain surfaces, as represented\nthrough a roughness height, is multiplied upward [e.g.,\nClifford et al., 1992]. Thus the effects of subgrid-scale\ntopography (e.g., grain surface morphology, grain interac-\ntions) are represented as frictional retardation of the flow at\nthe bed. This is normally based upon a standard \u2018\u2018law of the\nwall\u2019\u2019:\nu\nu\n*\n\u00bc 1\nk\nln\nz\nzo\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere u is the flow magnitude in the planform direction; z is\nelevation above a reference plane; u* is the shear velocity =ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ntb=r\np\n; k is the Von Karman constant (=0.4); tb is the bed\nshear stress; r is the fluid density; and zo is the height of\nzero velocity, which depends on the bed roughness. Bed\nroughness may be defined from the following:\nzo \u00bc u\n9u*\n; \u00f02a\u00de\nfor smooth boundaries and\nzo \u00bc 1\n30\nks \u00f02b\u00de\nfor rough boundaries, where u is the kinematic viscosity;\nand ks is the equivalent sand roughness following Nikuradse\n[1933]. In practice, equation (1) is modified as it assumes\nlocal equilibrium of turbulence, which is violated under\nconditions of flow separation. Thus Launder and Spalding\n[1974] recommend a nonequilibrium law-of-the-wall in\nwhich shear velocity is replaced by the square root of the\nturbulent kinetic energy per unit mass (k) as the character-\nistic velocity scale:\nu\nffiffiffi\nk\np\nu\n*\n2\n\u00bc\nln 0:25c0m\nffiffiffi\nk\np\nu\n*\nz\nzo\n !\n0:25c0mk\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhere c0m is an empirically derived coefficient equal to 0.09\n[Launder and Spalding, 1974]. In theory, provided the mesh\nis designed properly at the boundary, such that equation (3)\n2 of 18\nW01302 LANE ET AL.: MODELING WATER FLOW OVER GRAVELLY SURFACES W01302\nis only applied to boundary cells and the boundary is\nsmooth, the main concern becomes the validity of the\nturbulence model. In practice, k may be determined from the\ntransport equations in a two-equation turbulence model,\nwith diffusion of energy to the wall assumed to be zero,\nproduction expressed in terms of the shear velocity (u\n*\n2u\/2z)\nand the boundary condition for turbulent energy dissipation\n(e) set as:\ne \u00bc\nc0m\n\u0007 \b3=4\nk3=2 ln 0:25c0m\nffiffiffi\nk\np\nu\n*\nz\nzo\n !\n2ky\n\u00f04\u00de\nIf the condition for local equilibrium applies, equation (4)\nreduces to equation (1).\n[5] While there are significant concerns over turbulence\nparameterization in these near wall treatments, research has\ndemonstrated that, in natural river channels with gravelly\nbeds, much greater uncertainty is introduced into predic-\ntions of the three-dimensional velocity field due to poor\nknowledge and treatment of topographic variability than is\nintroduced by uncertainty over turbulence treatments at the\nwall [Lane et al., 1999]. The basic principle adopted for\nrepresenting topographic variability involves the multipli-\ncation upward of the equivalent sand grain roughness (ks) in\nequation (2b). In a 3-D modeling framework, this assumes\nthat the topographic variability that is not included in the\nmodel geometry is represented as a subgrid scale effect\nthrough upscaling of zo used in equation (2b). Much of this\nuncertainty relates to debate over which grain parameter to\nupscale and by how much. For instance, field investigations\nsuggest that zo should, including upscaling, take a value of\napproximately 0.1D84 [Whiting and Dietrich, 1990; Wiberg\nand Smith, 1991]. Others, specifying it as ks (noting ks =\n30zo), have suggested approximately 3.5D84 or 6.8D50 [Hey,\n1979; Bray, 1982]. Clifford et al. [1992] show that multi-\nplication of roughness length represents a measure of total\nflow resistance that incorporates contributions from both\nindividual grains and larger bed forms.\n[6] These uncertainties aside, the zo approach is associ-\nated with a number of problems. First, a wide range of grain\npercentiles have been adopted. While there is a general\npreference for the D84 [e.g., Whiting and Dietrich, 1990;\nWiberg and Smith, 1991] the most appropriate percentile\nmay depend upon the size distribution and sorting of the\ngravel mix. Second, for modeling purposes, the multiplier\nof roughness length will need to be spatially variable and\nscale dependent, in relation to both mesh resolution and the\ntopographic content of the data set used to describe the\nsurface. Third, some studies have noted problems in terms\nof numerical stability and solution accuracy for flows\ncharacterized by high relative roughness [e.g., Nicholas\nand Sambrook-Smith, 1999] with these difficulties resulting\nfrom the existence of an upper limit of ks for a given near-\nbed cell thickness [Nicholas, 2001]. The implication of this\nis that the thickness of the near bed cell limits the maximum\nshear velocity at the bed, so that near bed velocities may be\nover predicted in field situations that involve high relative\nroughness [Nicholas, 2001]. Fourth, there is the basic\nproblem of setting the reference height of the bed in a\nnumerical mesh: normally, it is assumed implicitly that the\neffective bed surface in mass conservation terms is the same\nas the bed surface sampled during field survey. Figure 1a\nshows how blocked grid cells are not effectively blocked in\na boundary fitted coordinate treatment. Even if the drag\nterm can be effectively specified, there will be mass\nconservation errors arising from cells that are not blocked\nbut which should be; and cells that are blocked that should\nnot be. It also demonstrates the real uncertainty in the value\nthat the multiplier of roughness length should take. The grid\ncells in Figure 1a are smaller than the average topographic\nspacing. Thus the multiplier effect has to represent both\nsubgrid-scale topographic roughness and a roughness com-\nponent that is lost because of the coarse spacing of topo-\ngraphic data collection. This suggests implicit limits to the\nuse of a roughness parameter such as zo to represent\ntopographic effects in three-dimensional flow models.\n[7] In practice, the problems in Figure 1a arise from the\ncoarse sampling of topographic data. The main alternative\nto using a multiplier of roughness length is to begin to\ninclude topographic data in the model. If actual data is\navailable, then roughness due to a difference between\nsampling density and grid density may be represented\nthrough introduction of topographic variability into the\nboundary fitted coordinates. For instance, Nicholas [2001]\nattempted to include bed form roughness (e.g., particle\nclusters) by using a random elevation model to introduce\ntopographic variability into the CFD mesh. This reduces the\nroughness problem to subgrid-scale topographic variability,\nbut assumes that (1) the random elevation model provides\nan adequate representation of topography; and (2) the mesh\ndistortion that arises from using the boundary-fitted coor-\ndinate approach does not affect the numerical solution.\n[8] This paper makes progress with these assumptions\nin two respects. First, developments in through-water (two\nmedia) photogrammetry have proved capable of generat-\nFigure 1.

Solid squares represent field sampled data points.\nW01302 LANE ET AL.: MODELING WATER FLOW OVER GRAVELLY SURFACES\n3 of 18\nW01302\ning accurate and precise (\u00b10.0005 m), high-resolution\n(0.001 m grid spacing) digital elevation models (DEMs)\nof submerged gravels for both field [Butler et al., 2002]\nand flume [Butler et al., 1998, 2002; Lane, 2001]\nsituations. Second, research into the performance of\nnumerical code has emphasized, amongst other things,\nthe need for careful investigation of discretization. This\nincludes the accuracy of discretization [e.g., Manson and\nWallis, 1997], convergence problems associated with fine\ngrids in finite volume discretizations [e.g., Cornelius et\nal., 1999] and the spatial discretization required for\nverification [Hardy et al., 2003]. However, provided\nattention is given to the way in which numerical solution\nachieves convergence [Cornelius et al., 1999], finite\nvolume treatments using structured grids have particular\nappeal as they provide fast and efficient numerical\nsolution and can be numerically stable in channels of\nsimple geometry. Stability problems may arise in channels\nof more complex geometry, where body-fitted coordinates\nmust be used. When meshes are fitted to the irregular\nbottom topography of natural river channels, there may\nbe marked spatial variation in grid size that may con-\nfound attempts to achieve grid-independent solutions and\nalso result in significant numerical diffusion. Therefore\nthere is a need to develop finite volume schemes that can\nrepresent complex topographies without distorting the grid\ncell size. Hence we deal with this problem by developing\nthe approach of Olsen and Stokseth [1995], which retains\nthe use of a structured grid but specifies cell porosities to\nblock out bottom topography (Figure 1b). We extend this\napproach to scale the drag terms required by the intro-\nduction of the porosity approach. We are able to make\nuse of a unique data set that combines high-quality two-\nmedia digital photogrammetric topographic data [from\nButler et al., 2002] with a dense network of three-\ndimensional flow measurements over the same surface.\n3. Numerical Scheme and Experimental Design\n[9] The numerical scheme involves a finite volume solu-\ntion of the full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations\nin a Cartesian coordinate system, with a Renormalized\nGroup Theory (RNG) k-e turbulence model.\n3.1. Porosity Treatment and Modification of\nDrag Terms\n[10] The porosity treatment is based upon the Olsen and\nStokseth [1995] approach, and we extend their methodol-\nogy to modify the drag terms introduced due to the\nporosity treatment. For a given Cartesian mesh, the topog-\nraphy is transformed into porosity values within the mesh.\nIn this situation, we assume that the topographic data takes\nthe form of a DEM, with a density of topographic data\nequal to (Figure 1b) or greater than the grid density. We\nalso assume that the numerical grid is defined with vertices\nthat are exactly collocated to the DEM. This means that\neither: (1) the DEM elevations map directly onto grid cells\n(equal density); or (2) the grid cells each contain a unique\nset of DEM elevations (greater topographic density),\nwhich can be used to determine the average elevation. In\nthe latter case, with a regular grid, there is a geometric\nseries of possible DEM elevations in a given grid cell (i.e.,\n1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36. . ..).\n[11] These two situations need slightly different treat-\nments in terms of porosity. Consider a structured, orthogo-\nnal Cartesian grid with directions i and j in the planform and\nk in the vertical. The equal density case is simplest, as each\nporosity value (Pijk) can be defined for each column of data\nat planform location (i, j), which has a singular value of\nelevation, Eij. Thus for cell k, if Zijk is the center of the cell\nand we assume cuboid cells so that the thickness of the cell\n(\u0002Zij) is the same throughout the column, then there are\nthree rules:\nEij \u0006 Zijk \u00fe 0:5\u0002Zij; Pijk \u00bc 0 \u00f05a\u00de\nZijk \b 0:5\u0002Zij < Eij < Zijk \u00fe 0:5\u0002Zij;\nPijk \u00bc\nEij \b Zijk\n\t \n\n\u0002Zij\n\u00fe 0:5\n\u000b \f \u00f05b\u00de\nEij \t Zijk \b 0:5\u0002Zij; Pijk \u00bc 1 \u00f05c\u00de\nFor the second case, there are a number of solutions of\nvarying complexity. The simplest is based upon deriving the\naverage elevation for a given grid cell from the DEM values\nwithin that grid cell. However, if there are 9 (i.e., a 3 by 3\nelevation matrix) or more elevations being assigned to a\nsingle grid cell, it is possible to determine a more realistic\nvalue of porosity by fitting surfaces to the elevation matrix\nand then working out the area-integrated average elevation\nas the basis of the porosity value.\n[12] Following Olsen and Stokseth [1995], and noting\nthe observation that, for rough gravelly surfaces, dealing\nwith the effects of topography upon mass conservation\nshould be a prime concern, we assume that the source\nterm represented by the drag terms in the momentum\nequation is so great that it dominates over the turbulent\ndiffusion terms. Thus the values of k and e in the\nporous domain (for 0 < P < 1) will have only\nnegligible effects on the flow field and the standard\nRNG theory k-e turbulence model is not modified in\nthese cells. Thus the only modification to the momentum\nequations that is required is a scaling of the drag term derived\nfrom the law-of-the-wall to represent the effective exposed\narea of the surface. To do this, we recognize that the effective\ndrag on an element will depend upon the direction of flow.\nConsidering a simple two-dimensional case (Figure 2a), the\nFigure 2. Illustration of the flow direction dependence of\nthe scaling term for drag. (a) DEM elevations. (b) DEM\nelevations after porosity determination with solid areas for\nPijk = 0, open areas for Pijk = 1; and shaded areas indicating\n0 < Pijk < 1.\n4 of 18\nW01302 LANE ET AL.: MODELING WATER FLOW OVER GRAVELLY SURFACES W01302\neffective drag experienced by cell i with flow direction L is\ngreater than with direction R.\n[13] There are three levels of complexity here that, as\nwith the porosity specification, need to be considered in\nrelation to both the DEM resolution and the grid resolution.\nIn the ideal case, the DEM resolution is such that it contains\nall scales of topographic variation other than the grain\nsurface scale [Butler et al., 2002] and the mesh resolution\nis the same as the surface resolution. For this, with a first\napproximation of flow direction, we augment the drag\nexerted by a given cell according to the change in porosity\nin the flow direction. For a given cell, the four differences\nin porosity between cell (i, j) and cells (i \b 1, j), (i + 1, j),\n(i, j \b 1) and (i, j + 1) are calculated. If there is a component\nof flow out of the cell in the + or \b i-direction or + or \b\nj-direction and porosity decreases in that direction (i.e., the\nadjacent cell has a higher elevation) then there is an\neffective \u2018\u2018jump\u2019\u2019 and the drag coefficient must be scaled\naccordingly. Otherwise, no scaling is applied. The scaling\nis based upon the effective (equivalent) surface area. We\nassume that all drag is exerted along the base of cells other\nthan for the sidewalls of the channel. A surface is then\nfitted to the 3 by 3 matrix of elevations centered on cell\n(i, j). The area (aij) of this surface for cell (i, j) can then be\ndetermined for the four vertices of the cell: (i + 0.5\u0002Xij,\nj + 0.5\u0002Yij); (i + 0.5\u0002Xij, j \b 0.5\u0002Yij); (i \b 0.5\u0002Xij, j \b\n0.5\u0002Yij); and (i \b 0.5\u0002Xij, j + 0.5\u0002Yij); where \u0002Xij is the\ngrid resolution in the i direction for cell (i, j) and \u0002Yij is\nthe grid resolution in the j direction for cell (i, j). With\ncuboid grids, \u0002Xij = \u0002Yij = \u0002Zij and the scaling factor (sij)\nis then applied to the roughness height in the wall function\nusing:\nsij \u00bc aij\n\u0002Z2ij\n\u00f06\u00de\nWe believe that equation (6) provides a good conceptual\nrepresentation of the drag augmentation: increasing the\nroughness height increases the effective elevation at which\nthe planform component of velocity would become zero.\nAlthough we are now scaling roughness height in a manner\nthat we sought to avoid, it is important to recognize that this\nis now only being applied to the grain surface scale and the\ntotal contribution of the drag term defined by the law of the\nwall should be significantly smaller as larger scales of\ntopography are represented explicitly in the numerical\nmesh. We explore sensitivity to zo with the porosity\ntreatment below.\n[14] In the second case, the DEM is of a higher resolution\nthan the mesh. In this case, there is information on subgrid-\nscale topographic variability available from the DEM. In\ntheory, this could be represented by an increase in the\nroughness height, which would be some function of the\nstandard deviation of DEM elevations falling within each\nboundary cell. However, Nicholas [2001] shows that the\nmagnitude of the required roughness height is related to both\ntopographic resolution and mesh resolution, the latter\nbecause of the way in which fluid shear between adjacent\ngrid cells is resolved. Thus there will be a nonlinear\nrelationship between any roughness parameter and the\nrequired mesh resolution, of a form that has yet to be fully\ninvestigated. This special case is therefore not considered\nhere.\n[15] In the third case, the DEM is of a coarser resolution\nthan the mesh. This is typically the case in applications of\nCFD to natural channels and traditionally requires specifi-\ncation of a roughness parameter to represent the effects of\nthis subgrid-scale topography. The porosity model provides\nan alternative method for dealing with this problem. Pro-\nvided something is known about the subgrid-scale variabil-\nity (e.g., the surface fractal dimension [Butler et al., 2001]),\nthen this can be used to create local topographic variability\nthrough the porosity field. As with the case where the DEM\nresolution matches the mesh resolution, this means that the\nroughness height only needs to be specified at the scale of\nthe mesh.\n3.2. Boundary Conditions\n[16] Boundary conditions need to be specified at the\nupstream inlet and downstream outlet, at the sidewalls and\nat the free surface. The upstream inlet is specified from\nexperimental data (see below) and the downstream outlet is\nspecified as a fully developed flow profile with the hydro-\nstatic pressure set at the surface at the downstream outlet.\nThe standard RNG theory k-e turbulence model is not\nmodified at the sidewalls or the bed and the equilibrium\nwall function is used. A roughness height (zo) is specified.\nFor the standard turbulence model to be valid, the z+\ncriterion must be satisfied:\n30 < z\u00fe < 300 \u00f07\u00de\nwhere\nz\u00fe \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ntb=r\np\nu\nzb\nand tb is the bed shear stress; u is the kinematic viscosity; and\nzb is the distance of the center of the wall adjacent cell from\nthe wall which, for the case of cuboid cells, is \u0002Zij\/2. This\nallows us to make sure that the first grid cell lies within the\nwall region and outside of the laminar sublayer. Within the\nwall region, shear within the fluid can be assumed to be the\nsame as shear at the bed, and determined using the\nequilibrium form of the law of the wall [Prandtl, 1952].\n[17] At the free surface, we use a method applied by\nBradbrook et al. [2000]. This uses a symmetry plane at the\nsurface across which all normal resolutes are set to zero. To\nrepresent the effects of water surface variation, nonzero\npressure terms on the symmetry plane are introduced to the\nmomentum equations, commonly referred to as a rigid-lid\ntreatment. This allows for the effects of both water surface\nsuperelevation and depression with respect to the plane in\nterms of the momentum equations. However, if the mass\nconservation equations are not corrected, it will lead to\nunder estimation of velocities in zones of water surface\ndepression and over estimation of velocities in zones of\nwater surface superelevation. To deal with this, we intro-\nduce an effective surface cell thickness (\u0002Zsij) into the\ncontinuity equation, which scales the equivalent cell face\narea in the cross-stream and downstream directions accord-\ning to the pressure (Psij) on the symmetry plane at cell (i, j):\n\u0002Zsij \u00bc Psij \b rghcijrghcij\n\u0001 \u0002\n\u00fe\u0002Zij \u00f08\u00de\nW01302 LANE ET AL.: MODELING WATER FLOW OVER GRAVELLY SURFACES\n5 of 18\nW01302\nwhere hcij is the elevation of the surface grid cell at location\n(i, j). Bradbrook et al. [2000] show that this yields a stable\napproximation of free surface elevation provided spatial\ngradients of water surface are not too great, and normally\nnot greater than \u0002Zij. This case is evaluated with each\napplication of the model.\n3.3. Numerical Solution\n[18] Numerical solution is based upon a finite volume\napproach. The use of a regular, structured mesh means that\nthe Cartesian space is essentially the same as the computa-\ntional space. The following nomenclature is used: C is the\ncell center; P is the present time step; N, S, E, W, H, L are\nthe centers of neighboring cells; E to W is increasing i\ndirection; S to N is increasing j direction; H to L is\nincreasing k direction; and T is the cell center at previous\ntime step. Thus the mass conservation equation integrated\nover a cell volume is:\naPfP \u00bc aN fN \u00fe aSfS \u00fe aEfE \u00fe aW fW \u00fe aH fH \u00fe aLfL \u00fe aT fT\n\u00fe source terms \u00f09\u00de\nwhere f is a variable and a is the neighboring link across a\ncell face:\na \u00bc Aur\u00fe AGf\n\u0002x\n\u00fe Vr\n\u0002t\n\u00f010\u00de\nwhere: A is the cell face area; u is the velocity component\nperpendicular to the face; V is the cell volume; Gf is the\ndiffusive exchange coefficient for f; \u0002x is the distance\nbetween cell centers which equals \u0002Zij in a cuboid grid; and\n\u0002t = time step. The cell center coefficient is given by\ncontinuity:\naP \u00bc aN \u00fe aS \u00fe aE \u00fe aW \u00fe aH \u00fe aL \u00fe aT \u00f011\u00de\nDuring solution, the finite volume equation is used to\ncorrect coefficients with the aim that errors converge on\nzero as the solution proceeds.\n[19] Scalar quantities are stored at cell centers and vector\nquantities at the centers of cell faces. Interpolation assump-\ntions must be made to obtain scalar values at cell faces and\nvector values at cell centers. If the convective (J) and\ndiffusive (D) parts of the flux across a face are separated\nthen equation (9) can be written as\nJN \b JS \u00fe JE \b JW \u00fe JH \b JL \u00fe DN \b DS \u00fe DE \b DW \u00fe DH\n\b DL \u00bc Sp \u00f012\u00de\nwhere Sp is the source and transient terms. Convection\nfluxes through cell faces are defined as\nJ \u00bc Cf \u00f013\u00de\nwhere C is the mass flow rate across the cell face.\nInterpolation to cell face values is based upon a Hybrid-\nDifferencing Scheme (HDS). A Cell Peclet number is\ndefined as\nPe \u00bc rjuj A\nD\n\u00f014\u00de\nIf Pe > 2, an upwind differencing scheme is used which\nassumes that the convected variable at the cell face is the\nsame as the upwind cell center. This is highly stable, but\nonly first order accurate, and so highly diffusive when flow\ndirection is skewed relative to gridlines. As we are using\nregular structured meshes in this case, this problem is\nsignificantly reduced. If Pe < 2, diffusion dominates and a\nsecond order Central Differencing Scheme is used.\n[20] To couple the mass conservation and momentum\nequations, the SIMPLEST algorithm is used (based on the\nwork of Patankar and Spalding [1972]). This (1) takes an\ninitial estimate of the pressure field to solve the momentum\nequation; (2) determines the consequent mass conservation\nerrors; (3) solves a pressure correction equation; (4) adjusts\nthe pressure and velocity fields; and then (5) applies this\ncorrected pressure to the momentum equation. This is\nrepeated until the mass conservation and momentum errors\nare acceptably small. This convergence can proceed either\nsmoothly or with damped oscillations to the final solution.\nTo achieve relaxation either: (1) realistic maximum and\nminimum values may be imposed on the solution; or (2)\nrelaxation may be used to limit the amount of change\nallowed in any variable at a given iteration. Weak linear\nrelaxation was used for the pressure correction and weak\nfalse time step relaxation was used for the other variables.\nThe convergence criterion was set such that mass and\nmomentum flux residuals were reduced to 0.1% of the inlet\nflux.\n[21] The porosity treatment was introduced in a series of\nstages. First, an initial solution was obtained for the flat bed\ncase. Second, the porosity treatment without the drag terms\nwas introduced. Finally, the drag terms were applied itera-\ntively until there was negligible change in drag.\n3.4. Experimental Design: Laboratory\n[22] The experimental geometry used for model develop-\nment and validation is based upon water worked gravels in a\n0.30 m wide and 8.0 m long tilting flume. A bulk sample of\nsediment from the River Affric, Scotland was placed in the\nflume (D50 = 0.020 m; D84 = 0.069 m) and water worked\nuntil a stable bed (no sediment transport) with a realistic\nstructure was obtained with a flow depth of approximately\n0.240 m. This realism was established using scaling analysis\n[Butler et al., 2001] and shown to have expected morpho-\nlogical characteristics: isotropic scaling at the grain surface\nscale; anisotropic scaling, oriented toward the predominant\nflow direction, at the grain-scale; and grain organization\ninto small bed form like structures. Table 1 summarizes the\nhydraulic conditions used in the study and Figure 3 shows a\nvertical view of the gravels.\n[23] Once the gravels had been water worked, the surface\nmorphology (e.g., Figure 3) was measured using two-media\ndigital photogrammetry (see Butler et al. [2002] for full\nexplanation). In summary, a transparent Perspex sheet\n(0.003 m thick) was used to flatten the water surface at\nthe time of exposure and five photogrammetric targets were\nfixed on the upper surface of the Perspex. DEM generation\nwas based upon 1:15 scale panchromatic stereo-photo-\ngraphs, acquired using two semi-metric Hasselblad ELX\ncameras, supported on a specially designed movable gantry.\nThe cameras were mounted 1.2 m above the bed and\nseparated by 0.31 m. Such geometry provided approximately\n65% overlap between the images, with a base: distance ratio\n6 of 18\nW01302 LANE ET AL.: MODELING WATER FLOW OVER GRAVELLY SURFACES W01302\nof approximately 1:4, which met general precision require-\nments (theoretical height estimation to within \u00b10.001 m).\nThe use of three exposure stations provided continuous\ncoverage of a 1 m strip of exposed flume bed (Figure 4).\nThe approximate focal lengths of the cameras were 0.08 m,\nand this parameter and an appropriate lens model were\ndetermined using self-calibrating bundle adjustment\nmethods as explained by Chandler et al. [2001]. This\nexperimental set-up allowed generation of DEMs at a\nspacing of 0.001 m. These DEMs have been subject to\nintensive data quality tests, in terms of point precision and\naccuracy and surface precision and accuracy [e.g., Butler et\nal., 1998, 2001, 2002]. For the topography shown in Figure 4\nthe mean surface error was 0.0008 m and the standard\ndeviation of error was \u00b10.0017 m. The latter was somewhat\ndegraded from the theoretical precision of \u00b10.001 m, but\nonly 8.5% of the grain-size D50, and so assumed to provide\nexcellent topographic representation. The main area where\nthis topographic representation will be less effective will be\nareas of dead ground [Butler et al., 1998], in the crevices\nbetween individual grains.\n[24] For the purpose of setting inlet boundary conditions\nand for model validation, velocity profiles were collected\nwith a NorTek1 Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV)\nmeasuring 0.010 m intervals above the bed at the planform\nlocations shown in Figure 5. The ADV was mounted on a\ncarriage set on the flume sidewalls and oriented into the same\ncoordinate system used to define the bed topography, with x\nvelocities in the ADV set to be parallel to the x direction in the\nDEM. In planform, three strips of data were collected, one\nalong the flume centerline and two either side of the center-\nline, each shifted by 0.050 m. In addition, for three locations\nin the downstream direction, an extra two velocity profiles\nweremeasured to assist in the specification of inlet conditions\n(Figure 5). Data were collected at 25 Hz for 120 s and subject\nto the basic screening recommended by Lane et al. [1998]:\nthe focus of this study was mean flow velocities and low\norder turbulence parameters and so filtering of each time\nseries to remove noise was limited to the removal of data\npoints with insufficient signal-to-noise ratios and point\ncorrelations less than 0.7 [Lane et al., 1998].\n3.5. Model Geometry and Boundary Conditions\n[25] For the purpose of these experiments, a 0.70 m long\nand 0.20 m wide section of river bed gravel was used to\ndefine the bed geometry. The computational domain was\nregular in the xy and z directions, with a grid resolution of\n0.002 m. In the z direction, to allow inclusion of topography\ndata using the porosity treatment, the maximum extent of\nthe domain was set at 0.24 m. Thus the computational grid\nwas sized at 350 by 110 by 120 (4 620 000 grid cells). In\nboth, the topography data was transformed into porosity\ndata. In this case, there were 4 DEM elevations available for\neach cell in the numerical mesh and hence the porosity was\nset according to the average of these elevations. At the\nupstream inlet, inlet conditions were specified using the\nADV data for cross section 1, as shown in Figure 6.\n[26] As we consider below, there ought to be very low\nsensitivity to roughness height specification given that the\nmajority of the topographic variability is now specified\nexplicitly. However, the wall treatment in the model still\nrequires specification of a roughness height. Given the DEM\nand grid resolution (0.002 m), and the DEM precision\n(\u00b10.0017 m [Butler et al., 1998]), the model will provide\nan explicit first order representation of topographic scales\ngreater than 0.004 m (i.e., following the Nyquist rule that the\nlowest detectable periodicity is twice the sampling interval).\nThe roughness height needs to parameterize the scales that\nare smaller than this. As we are now dealing with grain\nsurfaces, rather than grain organizations (as in equation (2b))\nwe set the roughness height at 0.001 m (50% of the resolved\nscales) to reflect the probable sub grid-scale topographic\nrepresentation associated with the model. It should be em-\nphasized that (1) there are no a priori experiments that have\ndealt with this scale of topographic data (as opposed to grain-\nsize data) in a hydraulic model of this kind; and (2) in theory,\nthe model should be very insensitive to specification of zo. If\nthis low sensitivity can be demonstrated (see below) we have\nremoved one of the major uncertainties in modeling flows in\n3-D over gravely surfaces: a strong dependence upon rough-\nness height specification.\n3.6. Model Validation\n[27] Model validation used an automated correspondence\nalgorithm to match ADV measurement locations to\nTable 1. Basic Hydraulic Data Associated With the Flume\nExperiments\nParameter Experimental Value\nAverage flow depth (m) 0.225\nMaximum flow depth (m) 0.240\nWidth (m) 0.300\nDischarge (m3s\b1) 0.0216\nFlow Reynolds number 2.88 \u000b 104\nFroude number 0.215\nSediment D50 (m) 0.020\nSediment D84 (m) 0.069\nFigure 3. A vertical view of the water-worked gravels.\nThis shows the photocontrol used for the photogrammetry.\nFlow measurements were surveyed into the same coordinate\nsystem used for the photogrammetry to allow a direct match\nup with model predictions.\nW01302 LANE ET AL.: MODELING WATER FLOW OVER GRAVELLY SURFACES\n7 of 18\nW01302\ncorresponding grid cell locations. The size of the model grid\ncells was 0.002 m by 0.002 m by 0.002 m. The ADV\nmeasures in a 0.08 m diameter cylindrical sampling volume,\nwith a height of 0.010 m. Thus it determines a spatially\naveraged velocity that corresponds approximately to 5 by 5\nby 4 grid cells. In the presence of strong shear in the flow,\nthis opens up the possibility of high-velocity variability in\nmodel predictions that will not be captured in the ADV\nmeasurements. Thus the average, standard deviation and\nrange of model predictions corresponding to each ADV\nmeasurement location were determined.\n3.7. Numerical Experiments\n[28] Following from model validation, a series of experi-\nments were undertaken to assess the interaction between\ntopographic data density and flow field representation, for a\ngiven mesh design. They also sought to address the influ-\nence of a range of boundary conditions, notably the free\nsurface treatment and roughness height.\n4. Results: Validation\n[29] Figure 7 shows a comparison of vertical variation of\nthe downstream variation of velocity above the bed for\neight velocity profiles, four from each of rows B and D in\nFigure 5, closest to the downstream end of the simulation.\nThe results are extremely encouraging. First, and most\nimportantly as compared with previous experiments\n[e.g., Nicholas, 2001], the model is especially effective\nat predicting strong shear, generally between 0.1 and\n0.2 z\/h above the bed. Although this study differs from that of\nNicholas [2001] in that we do not ensemble model predic-\ntions and field data but consider velocity profiles at specific\nlocations, Nicholas [2001] found that a wall function\napproach failed to reproduce the shear because: (1) the\nnecessary roughness height required excessively coarse\nmesh sizes at the bed, reducing resolution of the variation\nof velocity with elevation above the bed; and (2) the wall\nfunction does not represent the larger clasts that protrude into\nthe flow. The porosity approach deals with both of these\nproblems in that it allows application of the wall function to\nbe restricted to grain-scale roughness, permitting much finer\ngrid cells at the bed. When coupled to the specification of the\nbed using high-resolution digital photogrammetry, it also\nallows representation of the influence of downstream varia-\ntion in elevation associated with protruding clasts, and hence\nreproduces both situations where high velocities extend to\nthe bed at the top of protruding clasts and where there is flow\nseparation, both upstream and downstream of large particles.\nFigure 4. DEM of the flume bed used in this study.\nFigure 5. The planform positions where the ADV was used to obtain vertical profiles. The inlet\nconditions in Figure 6 were determined from data collected from the stippled area. The velocity profiles\nshown in Figure 7 are taken from the shaded area.\n8 of 18\nW01302 LANE ET AL.: MODELING WATER FLOW OVER GRAVELLY SURFACES W01302\n[30] Figure 8 shows a comparison of model predictions\nand field measurements for the downstream and vertical\ncomponents of velocity, and Table 2 shows the associated\nlevels of explanation as compared with previous studies. As\nLane and Richards [2001] note, there is a poor tradition\nof using formal statistical evaluations of the agreement\nbetween model predictions and field measurements and a\ntendency to focus upon qualitative comparisons of the\nvertical variation of downstream velocity with elevation\nabove the bed [e.g., Czernuszenko and Rylov, 2000;Meselhe\nand Sotiropolous, 2000; Sanjiv and Marelius, 2000;\nSofialidis and Prinos, 2000; Huang et al., 2002]. This\nis why Table 2 only covers a selected range of application\nof 3-D CFD models to river channel problems. In terms of\nflow speed, results from this study are similar to those\nobtained by Hodskinson and Ferguson [1998] but consid-\nerably better than those obtained by other authors. When\nflow speed is disaggregated into three orthogonal flow\ncomponents, previous models are found to perform less well\n[Lane et al., 1999]. In this case, the model retains a good\nagreement in terms of downstream velocity (Table 2) and\nmatches that obtained with a laboratory study [Bradbrook et\nal., 1998] involving a smooth bed, but complex flow\nseparation associated with a tributary. The agreement with\nvertical velocity is less good, but commensurate with that\nobtained for laboratory studies with smooth beds [e.g.,\nBradbrook et al., 2001]. This is partly to be expected given\nthe smaller range of magnitude of vertical velocities.\n[31] The level of correspondence implied in Table 2 and\nFigure 8 is also affected by the difference in the spatial\nscale over which laboratory measurements are made as\ncompared with the model grid size. As noted above, the\nADV measurement volume corresponds to approximately\n100 grid cells. Figure 7 shows extremely strong velocity\ngradients at the bed and it is here that the effect of\nthis resolution difference would be most acutely noted.\nFigure 9a shows the squared error in downstream and\nvertical velocities against relative elevation above the local\nbed, showing that the larger errors are generally found\ncloser to the bed. Figure 9b shows that the standard\ndeviation of model predictions within a given ADV mea-\nsurement volume is significantly greater at the bed. This\nconfirms that much of the error dependence in Figure 9a\nmust partly arise from strong shear at the bed within the\nFigure 6.

Results: Numerical Experiments\n[32] Figure 10 shows a comparison of model predictions\nfor downstream and vertical velocity and turbulent kinetic\nenergy (tke) with a smooth boundary (i.e., equation (2a))\nand a 0.002 m roughness height. Figures 10a\u201310c are\ndirect comparisons, but standardized with respect to the\nmaximum velocity\/tke recorded. These results are impor-\ntant as they demonstrate that the effect of the law of the\nwall is strongly limited to the grid cells nearest to the bed:\ninspection of the data used to generate Figure 10 shows\nthat standardized changes are less than 1% of the maxi-\nmum recorded value except in the wall cells over a range\nequivalent to 0 < z\/h < 0.05 immediately above each wall\ncell. As expected, the magnitudes of velocity sensitivity\n(scales in Figures 10a and 10b) are an order of magnitude\nless than the tke sensitivity (scales in Figure 10c) and the\nlatter extends marginally higher into the flow. Even with a\nmuch finer mesh and topographic resolution, the turbulence\nassociated with sub grid-scale topographic variability is\nsufficient to create an additional momentum sink as com-\npared with the smooth bed case. However, the spatially\nrestricted nature of this influence and the relatively low\nmagnitude, demonstrates how the influence of roughness\nheight is small and restricted to the bed: as hypothesized\nthere is significantly reduced dependence of model predic-\ntions upon roughness height specification except in the\nimmediate near-bed region.\n[33] If we repeat this simulation, but replace the spatial\ndependence of elevation with a spatially uniform elevation,\nstill represented through a porosity field (i.e., with a\nspatially uniform set of porosity values), we can demon-\nstrate the effect of grains and grain organizations upon the\nflow (Figure 11). The dashed line shows the spatially\naveraged elevation. The largest differences are where points\non the centerline of the flume experiment either contain\ngravel in the true topography (above the dashed line and\nwhich become \u2018\u2018unblocked\u2019\u2019 when a spatially averaged\nelevation is used) or do not contain gravel in the true\ntopography (below the dashed line and which become\n\u2018\u2018blocked\u2019\u2019 when a spatially averaged elevation is used.).\nFor the downstream component (Figure 11a), there are some\ndiscernible differences immediately above these blocked\nand unblocked areas. However, the sensitivity of the vertical\nflow component to topographic specification is much\ngreater (Figure 11b) than the downstream component. This\nimplies limits to the predictability of vertical fluid flow\ncomponents over gravely surfaces in the absence of high-\nresolution topographic representation. Comparison with\nFigures 10 and 10b suggests that both u and w are more\nsensitive to topographic specification than roughness spec-\nification. It also emphasizes the difficulty of treating both\nundetermined and indeterminate topographic variability\nthrough a roughness height, even if this is allowed to vary\nspatially. The effects upon turbulent kinetic energy\n(Figure 11c) mirror the downstream component of velocity\ngiven that gradients in u will be the prime source of\nturbulence in a model like this. It should be noted that\nthese findings need to be re-evaluated with either a turbu-\nlence model that can predict the effects of turbulence\nanisotropy or a Large Eddy Simulation, as it is possible\nthat with the full topographic representation, the turbulence\nwill extend much further into the flow.\n[34] These simulations are summarized, along with the\nother numerical experiments undertaken, in Figure 12. Here\nwe assess the effects of different boundary conditions and\ntopographic data upon the spatially averaged downstream\nflux. This is taken as a measure of the intensity of secondary\ncirculation: as the downstream flux is reduced, progressively\ngreater proportions of downstream flow are being converted\ninto cross-stream and vertical velocities. A number of\ninteresting points emerge. First, in this scheme, the smooth\nbed treatment (i.e., equation (2a)) actually results in a lower\ndownstream flux than the default case. This is initially\nsurprising as the switch to a smoother bed might be expected\nto increase the downstream flux. However, the smooth bed\nwill allow the topography represented in the model to have a\ngreater effect on the boundary flow, and hence increase the\nmagnitude of cross-stream and vertical flows. This would\nFigure 8. Comparison of a random sample of model\npredictions and ADV measurements for (a) downstream and\n(b) vertical flow components. The diagonal is the line of\nequality.\n10 of 18\nW01302 LANE ET AL.: MODELING WATER FLOW OVER GRAVELLY SURFACES W01302\nserve to reduce the downstream flux. This explains the\nobservation made by Nicholas [2001] that roughness length\nscales could be considerably reduced when a randomly\nperturbed bed replaced a uniform bed in a two-component\n(downstream and vertical velocity) model of flow over a\ngravelly surface. In 2-D and 3-D flow models, roughness\nheights do not effectively represent the blockage effect\nof spatial variability in bed elevation. The latter creates\nsubstantial vertical and cross-stream velocities that can\nhave a major flux. Second, the model displays negligible\nsensitivity to a 50% reduction in roughness height\n(Figure 12). The introduction of the porosity treatment,\ncoupled to high-quality topographic representation, limits\nroughness effects to skin friction. Third, creation of a\ntopography with a 0.004 m spacing (essentially smoothing\nthe surface) resulted in the largest change in downstream\nflux: Smoothing the topography increased downstream\nflux. Again, changing the nature of the roughness height\ndetermination (from rough to smooth, or by reducing the\nroughness height by 50%) had a negligible effect upon flux\nas compared with the effects of topographic smoothing. This\nconfirms the observation that roughness height is not an\neffective parameter for representing the effects of gravel bed\ntopography upon flow processes. Finally, and reflecting the\nobservation that the bed influence is limited to the bottom\npart of the flow, removing the free surface treatment had\nnegligible effects upon downstream flux.\n6. Flow Fields Over Gravelly Surfaces\n[35] Figure 13 shows five extracted cross sections of\ndownstream velocity for x\/l = 0.488, 0.494, 0.500, 0.506\nand 0.512, which corresponds to a 0.004 m spacing in the\ndownstream direction. Figure 13 shows large spatial varia-\ntion in near-bed downstream velocities, and this is reflected\nin the difference in the centerline predictions of downstream\nvelocity when they were compared with the spatially\naveraged porosity (Figure 11a).

However, the\nfive cross sections describe flow around a large particle,\nlocated at y\/w = 0.6 in Figure 14c. Upstream of x\/l = 0.5,\nthere is upwelling around this particle (Figures 14a and 14b),\nwhich is strongest at x\/l = 0.494 (Figure 14b). At this point,\nthere is also a weak stagnation point, with a zone of very\nslow downstream velocity (Figure 13b) and a steep velocity\ngradient above this. This stagnation has been observed in\nflume studies of flow around idealized objects (e.g.,\nM. Lawless et al., The effects of obstacle size and shape\nupon the time-averaged juncture vortex: An experimental\nstudy, submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 2003)\n(hereinafter referred to as Lawless et al., submitted manu-\nscript, 2003) and is commonly associated with a juncture\nvortex. By x\/l = 0.5, the core of high velocity extends almost\nto the top of the particle (Figures 13c and 13d) and the\nmagnitude of upwelling is reduced (Figures 14c and 14d).\nThis is associated with the highest point on the protruding\nparticle. Downstream of this, the velocity gradient is reduced\n(Figure 13e) and there is strong downwelling in the lee of the\nparticle (Figure 14e). Figures 13 and 14 both demonstrate\nthat the influence of topographic variability at the bed is\nlimited to essentially the bottom 25% of the flow. Vertical\nvelocities approach approximately 40% of the maximum\ndownstream velocity and are primarily associated with\nlocations of high rates of topographic change, upstream\nand downstream of particles. These are significantly higher\nthan the secondary circulations that have been measured in\nstraight channels associated with turbulence anisotropy [e.g.,\nNezu and Nakagawa, 1993] but, unlike observations of\nmacroturbulent flow structure over gravel surfaces [e.g.,\nBuffin-Belanger et al., 2000; Shvidchenko and Pender,\n2001] they are restricted to the bed, generally the bottom\n5% of the flow which corresponds to c. 0.010 m. This\nemphasizes the challenge (see Table 1 and Figure 9) of\nvalidating model predictions in this case as this range is\nsimilar to the vertical extent of the ADV measuring volume\n(0.008 m). It is probable that our ability to model this flow\nzone now exceeds our ability to measure it, except using the\nnew generation of particle image velocimeters (e.g., Lawless\net al., submitted manuscript, 2003).\n[36] Figure 15 shows predictions of turbulent kinetic\nenergy per unit mass (k) for a long-section. This shows\ntwo important features. First, there are very high values of k\nclose to the bed, again in a zone where there is most\nuncertainty in terms of ADV measurement. It has tradition-\nally been assumed that this is a zone of much lower values\nof k as a result of damping of streamwise turbulence\nintensities in the lee of roughness elements [e.g., Nezu\nFigure 10. The difference between model predictions with a rough boundary (zo = 0.002 m) and a\nsmooth boundary, standardized by the maximum velocity\/turbulent kinetic energy recorded with the\nrough boundary. (a) Downstream velocity, (b) vertical velocity, and (c) turbulent kinetic energy per unit\nmass. Note the plots show little change as the effects of zo are restricted to the bed.\n12 of 18\nW01302 LANE ET AL.: MODELING WATER FLOW OVER GRAVELLY SURFACES W01302\nand Nakagawa, 1993; Nicholas, 2001]. This is evident in\nFigure 15 (e.g., at x\/l = 0.71), but the effects of particle\nprotrusion into the flow result in three-dimensional flow\nseparation, resulting in generally high values of k at the bed,\nnotably where particles extend into the flow.\n[37] Second, there is a zone of higher k at about z\/h =\n0.20, associated with the zone of maximum shear in the\nvertical variation of downstream velocity with elevation\nabove the bed. This zone has been observed before, both in\nmeasurements [e.g., Wang et al., 1993] and model predic-\ntions [e.g., Nicholas, 2001], although at a somewhat lower\nrelative elevation above the bed (z\/h = 0.10 to 0.15). In this\ncase, we define z with reference to the lowest elevation in\nthe DEM, which will serve to raise the value of z\/h at which\nthe high k zone would be found. This is the well-established\nproblem of determining a reference height when the surface\nvaries in a complex way. However, when considering\nsomewhat larger roughness elements, Lawless and Robert\n[2001] identified peak k values between 0.33 < z\/h < 0.50\ninto the flow, associated with a shear layer in the flow.\nInspection of u component velocity predictions from the\nmodel identifies a zone of strong shear coincident with the\nFigure 11.

This matches\ndirectly the observations of Buffin-Belanger and Roy [1998]\nand Lawless and Robert [2001] that the largest obstacles in\na gravel bed create strong shear at the crest of the obstacle\nthat can have strong downstream provenance both because\nof the magnitude of shear created and because the shear is\nnot affected by obstacles further downstream. In turn, this\nexplains the high values of k at the bed, where the\ncontinuous variation of bed topography creates extensive\nshear in the bottom part of the flow as compared with the\ntraditional damping of turbulent kinetic energy expected\nwith decreasing distance from a smooth bed.\n[38] The main limiting issue in this study relates to the\nturbulence model being used in this study. A number of\nresearchers have described depth-scale flow structures\nover gravelly beds [e.g., Buffin-Belanger et al., 2000;\nShvidchenko and Pender, 2001], including time-varying\nFigure 13.

Shvidchenko\nand Pender [2001] observe that these may be associated\nwith large-scale eddies with a vertical extent associated with\nthe flow depth, and which migrate downstream. Clearly, a\ntime-averaged turbulence model will encounter severe prob-\nlems in reproducing this type of flow structure, despite its\nclear importance for sediment transport [e.g., Shvidchenko\nand Pender, 2001]. Even if a turbulence model, that is\ncapable of modeling the effects of anisotropic turbulence\nupon mean flow parameters [e.g., a Reynolds Stress Model),\nwere to be used, it is highly unlikely that these relatively\nlow period velocity fluctuations would be reproduced in a\ntime-averaged flow field. Thus current research is applying\nLarge Eddy Simulation to the quantification of time-depen-\ndent flow structures.\n7. Implications and Applications\n[39] A number of important substantive implications\nemerge from this research. First it has demonstrated the\nnature of bed topographic forcing associated with individual\nclasts, which was found to be restricted to the bottom 25%\nof the flow, but which could approach 40% of the down-\nstream flow velocity. This magnitude of variability will\ndwarf any secondary circulations caused by other processes,\nsuch as turbulent anisotropy, and this suggests that vertical\nflow variability in gravel bed rivers are topographically\ndriven, rather than hydrodynamically driven. However, it\nshould be emphasized that the results are from a time-\naveraged solution: time-dependent eddy shedding may\nextend to the full flow depth [e.g., Shvidchenko and Pender,\n2001] and interaction with the water surface should be\nexpected. Second, it shows that the position of maximum\nshear is pinned by the elevation of the top of the most\nprotruding particles. The larger particles are associated with\ngreater bed separation, and this appears to enhance turbulent\nkinetic energy production, rather than damping it right at the\nbed, as might be expected in smooth channels.\n[40] In methodological terms, a number of points emerge.\nFirst, the research causes us to be critical of some of the\nexisting research [e.g., Lane et al., 1999; Bradbrook et al.,\n2000] into flow structure formation in shallow gravel bed\nrivers. This is especially the case where the flow is shallow\nas compared to the bed topographic variance, and experi-\nments are required to assess the effects of different flow\ndepth to surface variance ratios upon the sorts of flow\nstructures that form. The same conclusion applies to esti-\nmates of bed shear stress derived from three-dimensional\napplications of CFD to gravel bed rivers where there is no\nproper topographic representation. Second, it emphasizes\nthe need for more sophisticated representation of the effects\nof bed topographic variability upon the flow field. In this\ncase, we dealt with an ideal situation where the bed surface\nstructure had been measured precisely to a high resolution,\nwith the precision and resolution an order of magnitude\nsmaller than the median grain-size of the bed. The techni-\nques used to generate this data can be applied in clear water\nstreams in the field [Butler et al., 2002], although the\nassociated fieldwork needs to be carefully designed. How-\never, it is unlikely to be feasible to acquire this sort of data\nregularly at the river reach-scale. The solution will be\nlarger-scale mapping of characteristic reach morphology\n(e.g., riffle-pool morphology) coupled to reconstruction of\ngravel topography for scales smaller than those mapped.\nButler et al. [2001] used two-dimensional fractal analysis of\nwater worked gravels to produce characteristic scaling\nrelationships. These can be used to create gravel topography\nwith the same scale-dependent statistical properties and so\nrepresent the effects of gravel topography upon reach-scale\nflow structures, if not the exact detail. A similar approach\nhas been used by Nicholas [2001] albeit using a scale-\nindependent estimate of surface variance and boundary-\nfitted coordinates with a two-dimensional (vertical and\ndownstream) model. The recommended approach is in\npreference to multiplication upward of roughness lengths\nas this does not effectively represent blockage effects, and\ndoes not pin the position of maximum shear at the right\nelevation in the vertical. The latter may be crucial for\ngetting the downstream flux to be correct.\n[41] The main limitation to applying this development at\nthe reach-scale will be the computational resources required.\nThe approach adopted has the advantage of using regular\nstructured grids in a finite volume formulation which makes\nit suitable to the new generation of fast numerical solvers.\nHowever, even then, using mesh resolutions smaller than\n0.01 m at the reach-scale will remain computationally\nunfeasible for some time. However, the porosity method\nmay be adapted to situations where the reach-scale geom-\netry is complex (e.g., tributary junctions, tight meander\nFigure 15. Turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass (m\b2 s\b2) extracted along the centerline of the flume\n(i.e., y\/w = 0.5).\n16 of 18\nW01302 LANE ET AL.: MODELING WATER FLOW OVER GRAVELLY SURFACES W01302\nbends with inner or outer bank separation) and obtaining\nnumerically acceptable grids is difficult, even with bound-\nary-fitted coordinates or unstructured grids. This would use\nthe same porosity formulation and drag scaling, although\nthe effects of the latter would become much more important\nthan was found to be the case here. This is an area for\nfurther research. Concurrently, it will have implications for\nthe boundary conditions required for initialization of the\nmodel (e.g., distributed 3-D flow data at the inlet, water\nlevel at the outlet), although methods have been developed\nfor situations where this data is not necessarily available\n[e.g., Bradbrook et al., 2000]. However, this research\nemphasizes the importance of a priori measurement of\ntopography, if successful predictions of flow fields are to\nbe derived for gravel bed rivers.\n8. Conclusions\n[42] This paper has described the development, applica-\ntion and validation of a porosity-based, structured mesh\nsolution of the time-averaged 3-D Navier Stokes equations\nfor gravel bed rivers. This has been based upon using high-\nresolution measurements of a flume bed, acquired using two-\nmedia digital photogrammetry, to specify the bed geometry.\nComparison with validation data acquired using an Acoustic\nDoppler Velocimeter showed an excellent agreement\nbetween model predictions and flow measurements given:\n(1) relatively few studies have previously undertaken quan-\ntitative assessment; (2) that good agreement in terms of\nvertical flow components has only previously been obtained\nfor laboratory studies with smooth beds; and (3) the very\neffective representation of shear at the bed in the downstream\nflow velocities. Sensitivity testing revealed very low sensi-\ntivity to whether a rough or a smooth bed was used at the wall\nand to whether or not there was a free surface treatment.\nComparison with a spatially averaged bed surface empha-\nsized the limits to prediction associated with vertical velocity\ncomponents in situations where the bed is not fully specified.\nModel predictions represented effectively the changing flow\nfield around individual bed particles. This suggested that\nthe most protruding bed particles exerted a critical control on\nthe turbulent kinetic energy maxima typically observed at\nabout 20% of the flow depth above the bed.\n[43] Acknowledgments.
