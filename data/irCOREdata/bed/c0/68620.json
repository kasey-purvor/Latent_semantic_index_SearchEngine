The process is shown\nto occur via optimal fluctuations that are well described, under diverse conditions, in\nterms of a new physical quantity, the logarithmic susceptibility (LS).\nINTRODUCTION\nThe question of how a system will respond to an external field is one of the\nfundamental problems of physics. Where the system is noisy and metastable, and\nthe field is strong and of high frequency compared to reciprocal characteristic times\nof the system, we have the celebrated nonadiabatic escape scenario - which for\nmany years represented a major unsolved problem in the physics of noise-driven\nsystems. We discuss below how it can now be addressed by use of the logarithmic\nsusceptibility, and we identify two of the (many) related problems remaining to be\ntackled.\nWhen the driving force is sufficiently weak, the response is proportional to the\nfield amplitude and can be analyzed using linear response theory [1]. The analysis\nof nonlinear response is more complicated, but can often be extremely interesting\nand important, e.g. for nucleation in phase transitions. The mechanism responsible\ncan readily be understood for low frequency (adiabatically slow) driving where the\nsystem remains in quasi-equilibrium under the instantaneous value of the driving\nforce. For systems in thermal equilibrium, the probabilities of escape are given by\nthe activation law, W oc exp[\u2014R\/kT] where R is the activation energy of escape.\nThe driving force modulates the value of R quasistatically and, even where the\nCP511, Unsolved Problems of Noise and Fluctuations, edited by D.

We emphasize that\nthe change of the activation energy is linear in the field amplitude.\nFor higher field frequencies, where the driving becomes nonadiabatic, one might\nthink that the change of the escape activation energy R will depend on the intensity\nI of the driving field rather than just be linear in the field amplitude A oc I1\/2.\nIn this case, where the system is away from thermal equilibrium, there are no\nknown universal relationships from which the escape probabilities can be obtained\n[2]: much effort has been put into solving the problem, in diverse contexts, and\nnumerical results have been obtained for specific models (see e.g. [3,4]).\nRecent theoretical results [5,6] show, quite counterintuitively, that for high-\nfrequency driving the change of R should still be proportional to the field am-\nplitude, i.e., InW should be linear in A. The proportionality coefficient was called\nthe logarithmic susceptibility (LS). Just like the conventional linear susceptibility,\nthe LS relates the response of the system in the presence of external driving to its\ndynamics in thermal equilibrium in the absence of the driving field.\nTHE LOGARITHMIC SUSCEPTIBILITY\nThe idea underlying the theory of the LS [5,6] is that, although the motion of\nthe fluctuating system is random, in a large rare fluctuation from a metastable\nstate to a remote state, or in a fluctuation resulting in escape, the system is most\nlikely to move along a particular trajectory known as the optimal path (see [7-11]\nand references therein). The effect of a comparatively weak field on the escape\nprobability can therefore be understood in terms of the work that the field does on\nthe system as it moves along the optimal path. One may expect this work to be\nrelated to the field-induced change in the activation energy R for the corresponding\nlarge fluctuation. This change is linear in the field, provided that the field-induced\nchange of the optimal path itself is negligible. It follows from these arguments that\nin the case of periodic driving F(t) = ^ k Fk exp(zfcfit), the leading-order correction\n6R to the activation energy of escape is\n6R = min \u00ab?(*<), 6R(tc) = ^\nc\n k\n\/\noo\ndtqM(t)em,qW = U'(qW). (1)\n-00\nHere, x(fi) is the LS for escape. It is given [5,6] by the Fourier transform of\nthe velocity along the most probable escape path qW (t) in the absence of driving\n(F(t) = 0). The path qW(t) is an instanton [12]: it starts for t -> -oo at the\nmetastable minimum qs of the potential U(q) and goes for t -> oo to the top qu\nof the potential barrier over which the particle escapes. The minimization over tc\ncorresponds to choosing the position of the center of the instanton so as to maximize\nthe work the field F(t) does on the system along the escape path q(\u00b0\\t \u2014 tc). We\n516\n0.4\nFIGURE 1. The dependence of the activation energy R on the amplitude A of the harmonic\ndriving force F(t] = Acos(1.2\u00a3) as determined by electronic experiment (filled circles), numerical\nsimulations (open circles) and analytic calculation (solid line) based on (1) for an overdamped\nDuffing oscillator U(q) = \u2014q2\/2 + <?4\/4; the dash-dot line, drawn parallel to the full curve, is a\nguide to the eye. The inset shows the absolute value of the LS of the system |x(f&)| (1) measured\n(filled and open squares for experiment and numerical simulation, respectively) and calculated (full\ncurve) as a function of frequency H using (2) with x(0) = \u20141 and rp = 7r\/2,M = \u2014(1 + z)(7rcj)1\/2\nin (2).\nnote that, for Markov systems in thermal equilibrium, optimal fluctuational paths\nare the time-reversed relaxational paths in the absence of noise [13-15].\nUnlike the standard linear susceptibility [1] which, on causality arguments, is\ngiven by a Fourier integral over time from 0 to oo, the LS x(\u00a3i) is given by an integral\nfrom \u2014 oo to oo. The analytic properties of x(fl) therefore differ from those of\nthe standard susceptibility, and in particular their high-frequency asymptotics are\nqualitatively different. The standard susceptibility for damped dynamical systems\ndecays as a power law for large fi (e.g., as l\/[U\"(qs) \u2014 i&], for the model of damped\nDuffing oscillator). In contrast, from (1) the LS decreases exponentially fast,\nIm f dq\/U'(q) (2)\nHere, the integral is taken from any point in the interval (qs,qu) to the (complex)\nposition qp of the appropriate singularity of U'(q). Note that q^(t \u2014 tc) for given\nreal tc has a pole or a branching point at Im t = rp. The prefactor M depends on\nthe form of U(q) near qp and can be obtained in a standard way. In particular, for\na polynomial potential (\\qp\\ \u2014> oo) with U(q) = Cqn\/n for \\q\\ -\u00bb oo, we have\nifThis expression applies also for finite \\qp\\, with U(q) \u00ab C\/p,(q \u2014 qPY for q -\nn in (3) is replaced by \u2014 \/\/: note that |M| then decreases with increasing fi.\n517\nFor weak damping, |x(\u00a32)| displays sharp peaks, and may have a multiply-peaked\nstructure [5]. It can be understood if one writes the velocity on the MPEP as\n= P(t) = Re^ Pn(E(t)) exp[-m0(t)], (4)\nn>0\nE\nwhere F is the damping of the oscillator, u(E) is the eigenfrequency of the vibrations\nthat have energy E in the absence of dissipation, I(E) is the action for these\nvibrations, and Pn(E) is the amplitude of the nth overtone of the momentum P;\nterms oc F in the equation for the phase, and fast-oscillating terms in that for the\nenergy, have been dropped.\nResonant contributions to |x(u;)| come from the vibrations of energy En(u)) for\nwhich ncj(En) = fi. In the range of fi where the contribution from an overtone with\na given n is much larger than from other overtones, we may approximate |x(ttf)| by\nthe function |xn(o;)| calculated from Eqs. (1) taking into account in (4) the term\nwith one n only. Evaluating the integral over time in (1) by the steepest descent\nmethod, we obtain\n\\Pn(E}\\\n-1\/2-\n7T dE\nE=En\n(5)\nTo test these predictions, we have built an analog electronic model [16] of the\noverdamped motion of a Brownian particle in the double-well Duffing potential.\nWe drive it with zero-mean quasi-white Gaussian noise from a shift-register noise\ngenerator, digitize the response q(t\\ and analyse it with a digital data processor.\nWe have also carried out a complementary digital simulation [17]. Numerical sim-\nulations in the case of small damping are currently in progress: preliminary results\nindicate a resonant behaviour of the LS. The analogue and digital measurements of\nR involved noise intensities in the ranges D == 0.028 - 0.036 and D = 0.020 - 0.028\nrespectively; the lowest (real time [16]) driving frequency used was 460 Hz. The\nresults are plotted in Fig. 1. The major observation is that, as expected, R is\nindeed linear in the force amplitude (R = 1\/4 for A = 0). The slope yields the\nabsolute value of the LS. Its frequency dependence, a fundamental characteristic of\nthe original equilibrium system, is compared with the theoretical predictions (2) in\nthe inset of Fig. 1.\nOPEN PROBLEMS\nThere are, of course, numerous related problems of obvious importance that can\nnow be addressed through use of our new theoretical, experimental and numerical\ntechniques. Two that we are considering are: noisy escape from a strange attractor;\nand large fluctuations in systems that have limit cycles.\n518\n-1\n-2 -1\n qi 0 1 1\nFIGURE 2.

The intersections of an\nactual fluctuational escape trajectory with this Poincare section are shown by the small black\ndots. The unstable limit cycle (U) at the boundary of the QA is shown by the filled square. The\nsaddle limit cycle which can be considered as a boundary of the QA itself is shown as crosses,\n(b) Three optimal escape paths found in numerical simulations with T = 0.002 using the method\nof optimal trajectories are shown by dotted, full and dashed lines; their relative probabilities are\n9.5 : 4 : 1 respectively. One period of the unstable saddle cycle (53) and unstable limit cycle\n(U) are shown by triangles and thick black dots respectively; 15 measured fluctuational escape\ntrajectories corresponding to the middle-probability optimal path are shown by thin full lines.\nPreliminary experiments on the first of these indicate that escape over the basin\nboundary of a strange attractor involves only a few periodic limit cycles that can\nbe found numerically: Fig. 2 shows results for a periodically-driven weakly damped\noscillator\nq = K(q, t) + f (t), K =\n>= (6)\nThe oscillator was monostable (7 > 0, ft2 < ^UJQ) and the energy dependence of\nits eigenfrequency was nonmonotonic (^ > ^)-\nIn the case of systems with limit cycles, it has been shown [18] that, in the vicinity\nof the unstable focus inside the cycle, the flow field of optimal paths generically\ndisplays a pattern of singularities. It contains a self-similar switching line that\nseparates areas to which the system arrives along optimal paths of topologically\ndifferent types. We have already been able to show how this topological pattern\nemerges as one moves away from the detailed balance condition assumed in a large\nbody of previous work.\n519\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil (UK) under grants Nos.
