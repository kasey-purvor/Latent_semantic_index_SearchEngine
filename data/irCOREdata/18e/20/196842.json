Introduction\n[2] Field\u2010aligned currents (FACs) exist in many geospace\nregions, such as the polar ionosphere and the magnetotail.\nThey have an important role for the transfer of momentum\nand energy between the solar wind, the magnetosphere, and\nthe ionosphere, and for dynamic processes in the magneto-\nsphere\u2010ionosphere coupling. In the early 1960s, FACs were\ndetected for the first time from satellites [Zmuda et al., 1966;\nCummings and Desler, 1967]. The properties of the FACs\nhave been examined, and some statistical characteristics of\nthe FACs have been studied [Fujimoto et al., 2001]. Iijima\nand Potemra [1978] made a statistic of the characteristics of\nlarge\u2010scale FACs above the ionosphere by using magnetic\nfield data by the TRIAD satellite at \u223c800 km altitude. They\ninvestigated region 1 (R1) and region 2 (R2) currents in the\npolar region. Elphic et al. [1985] used the magnetometer\ndata from ISEE 1 and 2 to analyze 189 plasma sheet\nboundary layer (PSBL) crossings and found that the distri-\nbution of the current polarity for small\u2010scale currents at the\npoleward boundary is opposite to that of the R1 current\nsystem.

Ueno et al. [2002] statistically studied\nthe outermost FACs observed by the Geotail spacecraft\nwhile crossing the PSBL inside XGSM = \u221240 RE. Their\nresults showed a dawn\u2010dusk asymmetry of the polarity of\nthe outmost FACs on the earthward side of the reconnection\nsite. Ohtani et al. [2005] studied seasonal variations of\nlarge\u2010scale FAC systems using the magnetic field mea-\nsurements from the DMSP F7 and F12\u2013F15 satellites. Their\nfocus was placed on the latitudinal extent at the demarcation\nbetween the R2 and R1 currents and the intensities of these\ncurrents. The results showed that the dayside FAC moves\npoleward and equatorward in the summer and winter\nhemispheres, respectively, and the nightside FAC has the\nopposite seasonal dependence. Christiansen et al. [2002]\nstudied the seasonal dependence of the dynamic properties\nof the dayside and nightside FAC systems over the Northern\nand Southern hemispheres, as inferred from \u00d8rsted and\nMagsat observations over polar region. Their results showed\nthat the dawn\u2010dusk distance between R1\/R2 currents\nexhibits little seasonal dependence in both polar caps. In all\nthe research mentioned above, the magnetic field data from a\nsingle satellite were used to estimate the FAC. This calcula-\ntion may be ambiguous because the time and space variations\ncan not be fully distinguished by single\u2010point measurement.\n[3] The Cluster satellites lie in an inertial, polar, 4 \u00d7 19.6RE\norbit and give multipoint measurements of magnetic field\ndata [Balogh et al., 2001], providing with us a good\nopportunity to calculate electric current with the so\u2010called\ncurlometer technique [Robert and Dunlop, 1998; Dunlop et\nal., 2002]. Vallat et al. [2005] studied the current density in\nthe ring current region using simultaneous multispacecraft\nCluster FGM magnetometer data with the curlometer tech-\nnique. Recently, Alexeev et al. [2005] presented Cluster\nobservations of parallel electron currents only using 3\u2010D, 4 s\nresolution data of the PEACE electron spectrometer in the\nplasma sheet during periods of reconnection. Draper et al.\n[2005] also reported Cluster magnetotail observations of a\ntailward\u2010traveling plasmoid at the substorm expansion\nphase onset and FACs in the PSBL associated with periods\nof reconnection. Snekvik et al. [2007] also have used the\nCluster data and studied a FAC at the dawn flank of a burst\nbulk flow in the outer central plasma sheet, close to the\nmidnight sector in the Southern Hemisphere. Forsyth et al.\n[2008] studied tail current systems associated with bursty\nbulk flows and auroral streamers during a period of multiple\nsubstorms using Cluster data. Using the curlometer tech-\nnique they determined that the current density of the FACs\nin the bursty bulk flow have been \u223c5 nA km\u22122. So far, no\nstatistical result of the FACs in PSBLs observed by Cluster\nhave been reported.\n[4] In this paper, we use the Cluster FGM 4\u2010point magnetic\nfield datameasured in the PSBLs in the magnetotail withXGSM\nof \u223c17\u201319 RE in 2001 to study the features of the FAC sta-\ntistically [Asano et al., 2005].We find, as our main results, that\nthe FACs have asymmetries in several aspects: dawn\u2010dusk\nasymmetry of occurrence, asymmetry of polarity (these are\nconsistent with that found by Geotail spacecraft inside 40 RE\n[Ueno et al., 2002]), and, in particular, south\u2010north asymmetry.\n2. Selection of Cases\n[5] The data used for this study are 4 s average magnetic\nfield data from the FGM instrument on board the four\nCluster satellites, taken in 2001 from the middle of July to\nthe end of October. In this period the Cluster array crosses\nthe plasma sheet and its two boundary layers around apogee\nat \u223c3 hours of local time around midnight. Figure 1a shows\na cartoon of the PSBLs in the magnetotail and the Cluster\norbit. In Figure 1a, the two gray areas schematically show\nthe PSBLs where the FAC cases were selected for this study\naccording to the criteria described below. The ellipse\nrepresents the Cluster orbit. The letters \u201cN\u201d and \u201cS\u201d show\nthe north and south PSBL, respectively.\n[6] As mentioned above, the FAC cases occur in two\nPSBLs in the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere,\nrespectively. In this study, we only selected those intervals\nof FACs located in the PSBLs, identified by low Bz field\norientations. In addition, we only chose the Cluster orbits\nthat cross the plasma sheet within YGSM from \u221215 RE to\n15 RE (\u223c3 hours LT around midnight) to avoid the\nlow\u2010latitude boundary region on the flanks. To select a FAC\ncase, the following conditions must be met. (1) BXY =ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nB2X \u00fe B2Y\np\n> 15 nT to exclude the cross\u2010tail current region.\nIt is known that the plasma sheet is always flapping in the\nZ direction, and it is difficult to identify the PSBL using a\nfixed\u2010coordinate system as reference. Ideally, one shall use\nb to define the PSBL region. However, since in this paper\nwe limited our data to FGM only, we apply the condition\nBXY > 15 nT as a proxy. (2) The density of the FAC exceeds\n3 pT\/km. (It is \u223c2.4 nA m\u22122 because 1.2566 pT\/km = 1 nA\nm\u22122.) This ensures that the current background noise and the\nerrors resulting from the current calculation using the tet-\nrahedron approximation are low. (3) The interval between\nconsecutive cases is more than 10 min. Figure 1b shows an\nexample of the FAC cases selected in this paper according to\nthe Bxy, FAC density, and chosen interval. In Figure 1b, all\ncases A, B, C, and D lie in the PSBLs because Bxy > 15 nT,\nbut case C should not be selected because the current density\nis less than 3 pT\/km and the interval of the case C and D is\nless than 10 min. Cases A, B, and D were selected because\nthey meet all three conditions mentioned above.\n[7] As we know, the current density and the magnetic\nvector are related through Ampere\u2019s law:\n\u00010\nZ\nA\nJ\n* \u0002 ds \u00bc\nZ\nC\nB\n* \u0002 dl: \u00f01\u00de\nHere, J\n*\nis the current, B\n*\nis the magnetic field, and m0 is the\nmagnetic constant. We calculate the current using the curl-\nometer technique that is based on Ampere\u2019s law, but esti-\nmate the integrals numerically from the spatially differenced\ndata. Considering that the separation of each two Cluster\nsatellites near apogee is \u223c2000 km in the 2001 phase and the\nconfiguration of the magnetic field is in the magnetotail\nPSBL, the curlometer technique [Dunlop et al., 1988, 2002;\nRobert and Dunlop, 1998] is accurate enough to identify the\nSHI ET AL.: SOUTH\u2010NORTH ASYMMETRY OF FAC A07228A07228\n2 of 10\nFACs in this study. To ensure that the data quality is suf-\nficient, we choose intervals for which\njr \u0002 B*j=jr \u0003 B*j << 1: \u00f02\u00de\nIt should be noted that in 2001, between July and late\nOctober, the separation between the satellites near apogee\nand the spacecraft configuration were fairly regular. The\nrelative spacecraft separation scale compared with the spatial\nscale of the current density in the magnetotail PSBL is\ntherefore favorable for application of the curlometer. We take\nthe ratio in equation (2) to be less than 0.3 to anticipate suf-\nficient accuracy in the analysis of the FAC properties. Typi-\ncally, however, the curlometer gives estimates of the FAC\ndensity with errors of \u223c12% for the set of cases chosen here\n(Figure 1b (bottom), for example, shows that current is\napproximately zero (<0.5 nA m\u22122), except for the FAC cases\nwith an average density of\u223c4.2\u20134.9 nAm\u22122).Wewould like to\nemphasize that the calculation using four spacecraft data gives\nan unambiguous estimate of the current within this accuracy.\n3. Statistical Results\n[8] According to the prescription in section 2, 172 cases\nwere selected to statistically study the properties of the\nFACs. The left\u2010hand panel of Figure 2 shows the mean\nBx\u2212By components for all the selected cases and shows that\nall the cases have BX > 15 nT, suggesting that all the\nselected FAC cases took place in the PSBLs. We also used\nthe plasma b to determine the PSBLs (1 > b > 0.01 for\nPSBL [Ueno et al., 2002]) and obtained the same result. It is\nalso apparent that the spread of By in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere is similar to that in the Southern Hemisphere but with\nFigure 1. (a) Cartoon of the PSBLs in the magnetotail and the Cluster orbit. The two gray areas show\nthe PSBLs within which the FACs occurred. The letters \u201cN\u201d and \u201cS\u201d show the north and south PSBL,\nrespectively. The ellipse represents the Cluster orbit. (b) Selection procedure for the FAC cases made\naccording to Bxy, FAC density, and interval. All cases A, B, C, and D lie in the PSBLs because Bxy >\n15 nT, but case C should not be selected because the current density is less than 3 pT\/km (or 2.4 nAm\u22122)\nand the interval of the case C and D is less than 10 min.\nSHI ET AL.: SOUTH\u2010NORTH ASYMMETRY OF FAC A07228A07228\n3 of 10\na larger spread (in the Northern Hemisphere). In Figure 2\n(right) we show the distribution of calculated FACs for all\nthe cases. At first glance, this shows a fairly even spread of\nvalues both north and south, and for tailward and earthward\ncurrents, although again with a larger range of density\nvalues in the Northern Hemisphere. We discuss the details\nof this distribution in Figures 5 and 6.\n[9] Figure 3 shows the position and the electric current\ndensity of all of the FAC cases projected into the X\u2013Y plane,\nin the GSM coordinate system. In Figure 3 (left), each arrow\nrepresents a FAC case, the starting point of the arrow is at\nthe location of the case (shown as a scatter plot in Figure 3\n(right) for clarity), the arrow direction represents the FAC\ndirection, and the arrow length represents the FAC magni-\ntude of the current density in units of nA m\u22122. The right\u2010\nhand panel in Figure 3 shows only the polarity of the FACs\n(earthward or tailward directed). From Figure 3 we can see\nthat the FACs are fairly evenly distributed over a range of\ndawn\u2010dusk local times, with only a few cases located at\ncloser radial distances, and that some currents are earth-\nward and some are tailward. The FAC polarity distribu-\ntion on the dawn side is not the same as that on the dusk\nside, which also suggests a dusk\u2010dawn asymmetry of the\nFAC distribution.\n[10] To clarify the dawn\u2010dusk distribution, Figure 4a\nshows the observed FAC distribution versus YGSM, In\nFigure 4a, the gray and the black in each block mark the\nearthward and tailward FACs, respectively. The height of\nFigure 3. FAC cases on the X\u2010Y plane in the GSM system.

This figure shows the FACs\u2019 dawn\u2010dusk asymmetry and earthward\u2010\ntailward asymmetry.\nFigure 2. (left) FAC distribution on the Bx\u2010By plane that shows the FAC cases were only selected in the\nplasma sheet boundary layers and (right) the calculated FAC density distribution for all the cases that\nshows FAC have a larger range of density values in the north hemisphere.\nSHI ET AL.: SOUTH\u2010NORTH ASYMMETRY OF FAC A07228A07228\n4 of 10\neach block presents the number of observed cases. We can\nclearly see the FAC distribution in Figure 4a. For the\nearthward FAC, there are two peak occurrences: one is on\nthe dusk side in the region of YGSM from 5 RE to 10 RE and\nthe other is on the dawn side in the region of YGSM from\n\u221215 RE to \u221210 RE. These two highest occurrences are nearly\nidentical, but in other regions of YGSM both on dusk and\ndawn side, the occurrences are different. For the tailward\nFAC, the occurrence is larger and takes place predominantly\non the dusk side in the region of YGSM from 5 RE to 10 RE.\nOn the dawn side, the occurrences in each region are small.\nTherefore, we can conclude with our statistical study that\nboth the earthward and tailward FAC distributions are not\nthe same on the dawn side magnetotail and dusk side\nmagnetotail. Therefore, we can say that the FACs have a\ndusk\u2010dawn asymmetry of occurrence in the PSBLs in the\nmagnetotail.\n[11] Figure 4b shows the fractional occurrence of the\nFACs versus YGSM. In Figure 4b, the gray presents the\nearthward FAC and the black presents the tailward FAC in\neach block. In order to compare the fractional occurrence\nbetween the earthward and the tailward FAC distribution\nmore clearly, the height in each block (from bottom of the\nblack to top of the gray) at each Y position is normalized as\nunit 1, i.e., the height of the gray part of the block (earth-\nward FAC\u2019s fractional occurrence) added to the height of\nthe black part of the block (tailward FAC\u2019s fractional\noccurrence) just equal 1 in each block. For example, in the\nblock of YGSM from 10 RE to 15 RE, the height of the gray\npart is 0.42 and the height of the black part is 0.58. This\nmeans that the fractional occurrence of the earthward FAC is\n0.42 and the fractional occurrence of the tailward FAC is\n0.58. We can then see more clearly from Figure 4b that on\nthe dusk side, the occurrence of the tailward FAC is higher\nthan that of the earthward FAC. On the dawn side, in the\nregion of YGSM = 0 to \u22125 RE, the occurrence of the tailward\nFAC is slightly higher than that of the earthward. In the\nregion of YGSM = \u22125 RE to \u221215 RE, however, the occurrence\nof the tailward FAC is lower than that of the earthward.\nTherefore, we can say that the FACs have polarity asym-\nmetry in the PSBLs in the magnetotail, and the polarity\nasymmetry is more pronounced on the dawn side.\n[12] This dawn\u2010dusk asymmetry of the polarity of FACs\nin the region of 17\u201319 RE in the magnetotail shown in this\npaper is consistent with that expected for the large\u2010scale R1\ncurrent system, as found by other work inside 40 RE in the\nmagnetotail [Ueno et al., 2002]. In this study, we also\ninvestigate the earthward\u2010tailward asymmetry in the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres separately. The posi-\ntions of FACs in the Cluster orbit at 17\u201319 RE in the\nmagnetotail are likely to connect both to the inner R1 cur-\nrent system and to currents at the poleward boundary. It is\nalso possible that, in the event of tail reconnection, a neutral\nline (NENL) may form either earthward or tailward of the\nCluster location. To consider the R1 current system more\ndirectly, therefore, we use the sign of Bz to filter out any\nreconnection\u2010driven currents, which arise from a NENL\nlocated earthward of the spacecraft, i.e., those lying on field\nlines with negative Bz, in general, will not connect to the\nEarth. Note here that seasonal dependence of the Cluster\norbit implies that all cases here correspond toward dipole tilt\nangles, so that Bz is likely to be positive for field lines\nconnecting to the Earth. There are 146 cases with condition\nBz > 0 selected for the analysis. Figure 5 illustrates the\ndistribution of all the 146 FAC cases in the Northern\nHemisphere (three panels on the left hand) and Southern\nHemisphere (three panels on the right hand), respectively. In\nFigure 5, for both left and right sides, the top two panels\nshow the FAC location on the X\u2010Y plane in the GSM sys-\ntem, and Figure 5 (middle) shows the projected current\ndensity in the same format as for Figure 3. Figure 5 (bottom)\nshows the FAC\u2019s fractional occurrence versus YGSM,\ncorresponding to the FAC cases in the top panels, the gray\nand the black mark the earthward and tailward FACs,\nrespectively, as for the right\u2010hand side of Figure 4.\n[13] From the top two panels in Figure 5, we can clearly\nsee that the distributions of FAC locations are different\nbetween the two hemispheres. The distribution of FAC\nlocations is more spread on the dusk side of the Northern\nHemisphere and the dawn side of the Southern Hemisphere.\nIn Figure 5 (middle), it can be seen that there are also\nFigure 4.

On each side, the upper two panels\nshow the FAC location on the X\u2010Y plane in the GSM system with the circle to mark the tailward FAC and\nthe star to mark the earthward FAC. Figure 5 (middle) shows the FAC density (marked by arrow length)\nand polarity (marked by arrow head) correspondence to the FAC cases in the upper panels. Figure 5 (bottom)\nshows the FACs fractional occurrence versus YGSM correspondence to the FAC cases in the upper panels, the\ngray and the black mark the earthward and tailward FACs, respectively.\nSHI ET AL.: SOUTH\u2010NORTH ASYMMETRY OF FAC A07228A07228\n6 of 10\ndifferences in the FAC density distribution and polarity\ndistribution between the two hemispheres. The earthward\u2010\ntailward polarities (see distributions in the Figure 5 (middle))\nshow a strong asymmetry from dawn to dusk in the\nNorthern Hemisphere, while this is not so pronounced in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. It is also clear that, while the number\nof cases is relatively evenly spread in the Northern Hemi-\nsphere, the occurrence of cases in the Southern Hemisphere\nappears to increase from dawn to dusk. Figure 5 (bottom)\nshows this result statistically. We can see that in the\nNorthern Hemisphere, from Y = 10 to 15 RE, there were no\nFAC measured, which is much different from the situation\nin the Southern Hemisphere. Also, the dawn\u2010dusk asym-\nmetry both for earthward and tailward FACs in the two\nhemispheres are not the same. The polarity (earthward or\ntailward) asymmetry is different in the two hemispheres\nboth on the dawn side and the dusk side. The polarity\nasymmetry in the northern hemisphere is clearly much\nstronger than that in the southern hemisphere, which shows\nonly a weak trend.\n[14] Supporting this plot, Table 1 shows the average\ndensities and standard deviations of the FACs with condi-\ntion Bz > 0 (the 146 cases as mentioned above) for both\npolarities (earthward and tailward) in the different hemi-\nspheres. We can see from Table 1 that the average density of\nall FACs is 4.90 nA m\u22122 in the Northern Hemisphere and\n4.21 nA m\u22122 in the Southern Hemisphere, and the standard\ndeviation is 2.55 nA m\u22122 in the Northern Hemisphere and\n1.80 nA m\u22122 in the Southern Hemisphere, respectively. Both\nthe average density of the FACs and its standard deviation\nin the Northern Hemisphere has a value different from that\nin the Southern Hemisphere. In addition to this analysis, we\nhave performed Welch\u2019s test for the FAC average density in\nthe two hemispheres using the statistical values provided in\nTables 1 and 2. The test result shows that, with a test\nstandard a = 0.10, i.e., 90% probability, we can conclude\nthat the FACs have different average densities in the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres. Also, we can say from\nTable 1 that both for earthward and tailward FACs, the\naverage density and its standard deviation in the Northern\nHemisphere are higher than those in the Southern Hemi-\nsphere. Indeed, in the right panel of Figure 2, we can see that\nthe FACs have a larger range of density values in the\nNorthern Hemisphere. That is why the average current\ndensity is higher in the Northern than in the Southern\nHemisphere.\n[15] Table 2 gives the distribution of FAC cases with\ncondition Bz > 0 (the 146 cases as mentioned above) for\neach sector, polarity, and hemisphere. From Table 2, we can\nsee that, on the dawn side, there were 44 cases taken in the\nNorthern Hemisphere and 19 cases taken in the Southern\nHemisphere (for both earthward and tailward currents). We\nalso can see from Table 2 that, on the dusk side, there were\n29 cases taken in the Northern Hemisphere and 54 cases\ntaken in the Southern Hemisphere. Thus, there is a larger\nimbalance in the occurrence of cases in the Southern\nHemisphere, with the majority of cases occurring on the\ndusk side in the south (as seen on the plots in Figure 5).\nMoreover, for each of the earthward and tailward current\ncases, either on the dawn side or dusk side, the occurrence\nof the FACs is different, although the asymmetry is more\npronounced for the earthward currents. Also, in the Northern\nHemisphere, we see that the dominance of earthward FACs\non the dawn side, and tailward FACs on the dusk side, is\nmuch more pronounced than in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe variance in the distribution therefore confirms that the\npolarity trends are statistically significant. These further\nshow FACs asymmetry in the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres.\n[16] In summary, we have found that in the Northern\nHemisphere the number of the FACs cases is relatively\nevenly distributed in LT, but that the earthward\u2010tailward\npolarity has a more pronounced dawn\u2010dusk asymmetry. In\nthe Southern Hemisphere, the occurrence is progressively\nhigher with decreasing LT (from dawn to dusk), but the\nearthward\u2010tailward asymmetry is much less pronounced.\n4. Discussion in the Polar Ionosphere\n[17] In this study, we also used the T\u201096 geomagnetic\nmodel [Tsyganenko and Stern, 1996] to map all FACs along\nthe magnetic field lines from the FAC location to the polar\nregion to more clearly identify the latitude locations, in\nparticular, near the polar cap boundary. The resulting\nmapped distribution also showed a difference between the\nNorthern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. For\nexample, Figure 6a shows the footprints in the polar region\nin the two hemispheres. In Figure 6a, the left panel is for the\nfootprints of FACs in the Northern Hemisphere and the right\npanel is for those in the Southern Hemisphere. The stars\nmark the tailward FAC and the circles mark the earthward.\nSince the Cluster orbit crosses the PSBL at \u223c17\u201319 RE radial\ndistance, it is likely that both open\u2010 and closed\u2010field lines\nare sampled mapping to the whole region 1 and polar cap\nboundary current system in the ionosphere. Here, we again\nuse the 146 cases as above to do the analysis, which have\nfiltered out any reconnection\u2010driven currents arising from a\nNENL located earthward of the spacecraft, i.e., those lying\non field lines not connected to the Earth. Since the cases all\noccur toward dipole tilt angles, it is likely that any cases for\nwhich Bz is negative will correspond to disconnected field\nlines, tailward of an x\u2010line.\n[18] From Figure 6a we can see that distributions of the\nFAC footprints are different in the two hemispheres. First,\nthe FAC distribution is from the longitude of 2030 magnetic\nlocal time (MLT) to 0415 MLT in the Northern Hemisphere\nand is from the longitude of 1930 MLT to 0415 MLT in the\nTable 1.

This shows that the FAC has a wider\ndistribution in longitude in the Southern than in the North-\nern Hemisphere. Second, the FAC distribution in latitude, in\nthe Southern Hemisphere, is wider before midnight and\nnarrower after midnight compared with those in the North-\nern Hemisphere (which only has high\u2010latitude cases on the\nextreme dawnside location). This fact could mean that the\nsouthern distribution may contain more cases of reversed\npolarity arising from the region of the polar cap boundary\nand therefore could explain the lower dawn\u2010dusk asymme-\ntry in the Southern Hemisphere. Figure 6b illustrates the\nFAC footprint distribution versus latitude in the two hemi-\nspheres. We can see that the earthward FAC occurrences in\nthe Northern Hemisphere, in general, are similar to the\ntailward FACs in each 10\u00b0 range from a latitude of 60\u00b0 to\none of 80\u00b0. In the Southern Hemisphere, however, there are\ndifferences in the number of earthward and tailward cases at\neach latitude bin. That is to say, the mapping and the\nfootprints of the FACs are different in the Northern and\nSouthern Hemispheres. The main difference, however,\nseems to be that the southern distribution is skewed for la-\ntitudes <65\u00b0, with a large, persistent number of tailward\nFAC cases below 65\u00b0. In addition, there is an excess of\ntailward cases in the latitude range 70\u00b0\u201375\u00b0.\n[19] Closer inspection of Figure 6 shows that the LT\ndistribution of cases reflects that already noted: the tailward\ncases lie predominantly on the dusk side and the earthward\ncases lie predominantly on the dawn side in the Northern\nHemisphere. We also note that this northern distribution\nshows no evidence of a large number of reverse boundary\ncurrents at high latitudes. The distribution in the Southern\nHemisphere, however, shows no clear asymmetry and the\ntailward and earthward cases are fairly evenly spread in both\nlatitude and LT, with significantly more cases occurring at\nlatitudes higher than 70\u00b0 on the dusk side. The low\u2010latitude\ntailward cases are therefore as much responsible for the\nreduction in dawn\u2010dusk asymmetry as the higher latitude\nones and, therefore, the result does not arise solely from\npoleward\u2010driven, reverse currents. From the above, we can\nsee that the FAC occurrence, density, and mapping foot-\nprints are different in the Northern and Southern Hemi-\nspheres. These clearly show that the FACs between the\nFigure 6.

The FAC cases in this figure exclude those\nwith the condition Bz < 0. (b) FAC footprint distribution versus invariant latitude (ILAT) in the two hemi-\nspheres corresponding to Figure 6a: (left) Northern Hemisphere and (right) Southern Hemisphere. The\nFAC cases in this figure, of course, exclude those with the condition Bz < 0.\nSHI ET AL.: SOUTH\u2010NORTH ASYMMETRY OF FAC A07228A07228\n8 of 10\nionosphere and magnetosphere have a north\u2010south hemi-\nspheric asymmetry.\n[20] We would like to mention that a typical thickness of\nthe FAC cases in PSBLs was evaluated as \u223c4000 km. When\nwe mapped the FACs to the ionospheric height, the thick-\nness comes to \u223c67 km. This is consistent with the results of\nother authors [e.g., Frank et al., 1981].\n[21] For the dawn\u2010dusk asymmetry of the FACs, we have\nmade further analysis with the attempt to filter out any\nreconnection\u2010driven currents arising from a NENL located\nearthward of the spacecraft, i.e., those lying on field lines\nnot connected to the Earth. For the north\u2010south hemispheric\nasymmetry of the FACs, there are several plausible causes.\nAs we know, the solar wind has control of the FACs in the\nmagnetosphere. Thus, the first cause should be the config-\nuration of the magnetosphere. Because of the geomagnetic\ndipolar title angle and the solar wind asymmetry related to\nthe magnetosphere, it could result in the FAC north\u2010south\nhemispheric symmetry in the magnetosphere. The second\ncause is a change in the ionospheric conductivity [Fujii et al.,\n1981; Ohtani et al., 2005; Vallat et al., 2005]. Because of\nthe dipole tilt angle, the amount of EUV radiation reaching\nthe ionosphere can change the amount and distribution of\nconductivity in different hemispheres. As a result, the high\u2010\nlatitude field\u2010aligned intensities can be larger by a factor of\n1.5\u20131.8 in the sunlit (summer) polar cap in comparison with\nthe winter hemisphere [Christiansen et al., 2002]. This\ncould also result in the north\u2010south hemispheric asymmetry\nof FACs in the magnetosphere. Christiansen et al. [2002]\nhad offered a different explanation for the FAC system.\nThey argued that the seasonal dependence in the global FAC\nsystem is generated and maintained by the various solar\nwind\u2010magnetosphere interaction processes, such as the\nquasi\u2010viscous interaction and reconnection. This argument\ncould also be used to interpret the north\u2010south asymmetry.\nFurthermore, since the current densities of the FACs are\ndifferent between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres,\nan important source (but perhaps not the only source) of\nthese currents must be a voltage generator, possibly related\nto the convective electric field. However, these issues\nrequire further investigation and study.\n5. Summary\n[22] We used the data of the fluxgate magnetometer on\nboard the Cluster spacecraft in the period of July to October\n2001 and studied the characteristics of the FAC distribution\nin the plasma sheet boundary layer in the magnetotail. There\nwere 172 FAC cases chosen for the statistics. The current was\ncalculated with the curlometer technique using the 4\u2010point\nmeasurement and we took the ratio jr \u0002 B*j=jr \u0003 B*j < 0:3\nto ensure the data quality. (Typically, we found that the\nestimates of the FAC density errors are within 12%.) We\nalso attempted to filter out any reconnection\u2010driven currents\narising from a NENL located earthward of the spacecraft by\nremoving those cases corresponding to Bz negative, and\nthere are 146 FAC cases that have a clear Bz\u2010positive\nbackground field (those most likely to be Earth connected).\nThe main results are as follows.\n[23] 1. The FAC distribution on the dawn side is different\nfrom that on the dusk side and shows a dusk\u2010dawn asym-\nmetry of earthward and tailward FACs, which is consistent\nwith that expected from the large\u2010scale R1 current system.\nThis is the first time that the dusk\u2010dawn asymmetry of the\nFACs in the region of 17\u201319 RE in the magnetotail has been\nconfirmed by Cluster observation, otherwise it has been\nfound by the Geotail spacecraft inside 40 RE [Ueno et al.,\n2002].\n[24] 2. There is a north\u2010south hemispheric asymmetry of\nthe FACs in the PSBLs: the occurrences of the FACs have\ndifferent values in the two hemispheres, as do the polarity\ndistributions. In addition, the average density and its stan-\ndard deviation of the FACs, both for earthward and tailward\nFACs in the Northern Hemisphere are different from that in\nthe Southern Hemisphere. Furthermore, when we made a\nmapping of all FACs along the magnetic field lines from the\nFAC location to the polar ionospheric region, the footprints\nof the FACs also showed a difference between the Southern\nand Northern Hemispheres.\n[25] We analyzed and discussed the asymmetries of the\nFACs in the magnetosphere. Asymmetry of the configuration\nof the magnetosphere and the solar wind, the conductivity in\nthe ionosphere, and the various solar wind\u2010magnetosphere\ninteraction processes (such as the quasi\u2010viscous interaction\nand reconnection) may be the reasons for the asymmetry of\nthe FACs in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, but it\nneeds further investigation. The fact that the current densi-\nties of the FACs are different between the Northern and\nSouthern hemisphere also suggests that an important source\n(but perhaps not the only source) of these currents is a\nvoltage generator, possibly related to the convective electric\nfield.\n[26] Acknowledgments.
