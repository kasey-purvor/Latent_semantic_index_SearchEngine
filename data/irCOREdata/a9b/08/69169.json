According to these accounts, as the state reacts to the political \nrisks associated with asylum migration control, responsibility for forced \nmigration management is increasingly transferred onto a range of intermediate \nactors, between state and society, including local government employees, \nasylum interviewers, immigration judges and security staff. Yet little research \nhas directly addressed these intermediaries\u2019 collective experiences and the \ninfluences to which they are subject. The article therefore focuses attention \nexplicitly upon the nominal conduct of this increasingly authorised, \ndiscretionary and highly heterogeneous population. Drawing upon thirty-seven \ninterviews across four sites at which asylum sector intermediaries have \nsignificant and increasing discretion over asylum seekers\u2019 experiences, the \nfindings demonstrate the importance of institutionalised timing and spacing for \nthe determination of their volitional conduct. The timing and spacing of \ngovernment institutions are important, not only through their influence over \nasylum seekers directly, but also because they present asylum seekers to those \nwith discretionary authority in ways that are conducive to exclusionary uses of \nthis authority. \n \nKeywords: State, Asylum, Power, Devolution, Discretion, Space-Time. \n \nIntroduction \n \nAs taken-for-granted categories, such as \u2018state\u2019, \u2018civil society\u2019 or \u2018economy\u2019 \nappear to dissolve in the face of networked globalisation, new sets of actors are \nbecoming increasingly empowered and responsibilised (Cloke and Johnston \n2005; Painter 2006). Decision makers throughout the institutional landscape are \nbearing more risk and taking on increasing autonomy as a result of the \npolitically motivated shift towards agency over structure in neo-liberal, post-\nmodern institutions (Beck 1992; Castells 2000). Against the backdrop of the \nworld-wide trend towards devolution in the public sector, and rationalisation in \nthe private sector, a host of intermediate actors, located at the increasingly fuzzy \nboundaries between state, market and society, are taking up responsibilities and \n 1\nauthorities that once resided unambiguously in these spheres (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose \nand Gill 2003). \n \nWhat this divestment of authority conceals, however, is a turf war for the \nvolitional allegiance of these newly responsibilised actors (Foucault 1979; \nLemke 2002). In the case of state actors, this article argues that the key metrics \nof this struggle are no longer centred around the financially induced or legally \ncoerced actions of state employees, but around the ideologically affected desires \nof state personnel themselves (Lukes 2005; Rose 1999). Taking the \nmanagement of asylum seekers in the UK as a case study, the article seeks to \nuncover the means and mechanisms of this struggle for allegiance among those \nactors who have experienced increasing responsibilities over the past three \ndecades. \n \nDrawing upon thirty-seven interviews conducted with decision makers, activists \nand asylum seekers throughout the asylum sector in the UK between June 2005 \nand July 2006 the article focuses upon the experiences of four intermediary \nfigures. Asylum caseworkers decide upon initial claims for refugee status in the \nUK; National Asylum Support Service (NASS) employees decide whether or \nnot asylum seekers are eligible to receive financial support; immigration judges \ndetermine appeals for refugee status if an initial claim has been unsuccessful \nand removal centre managers are responsible for refused, incarcerated asylum \nseekers\u2019 welfare as they await deportation. Evidence is taken from four sites in \nthe UK corresponding to these four intermediaries: Lunar House, the \nheadquarters of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate1 in Croydon; the \noffices of NASS in Portishead2; the legal asylum advocacy community in \nBristol; and Campsfield Removal Centre in Oxfordshire. The choice of these \nfour sites is intended to broadly reflect the processual story that underpins the \nstate-justified legal practices that asylum seekers experience in the UK. The \narrival and lodging of an asylum claim takes place in government offices such \nas those at Lunar House. NASS is responsible for the delivery of welfare \nsupport to asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their claim. During this time \nasylum seekers utilise legal support.

The article \nargues that intermediaries\u2019 discretionary decisions are influenced by the way in \nwhich asylum seekers are presented to them through the institutional \narrangements within which intermediaries and asylum seekers interact. In \nparticular, two types of influences are identified that seek to act upon, and \ncompete for, the ideational allegiance of this group: temporal and spatial \npresentational strategies. The identification of these influences embellishes \nexisting research into the influences over asylum sector officials that tends to \nemphasise linguistic effects, for example in the language of policy documents \n(D\u00fcvell and Jordan 2003; United Nations High Commission for Refugees \n(UNHCR) 2005; Weber 2003) and the popular representations of asylum \nseekers in the printed press (Finney and Robinson 2007; Kaye 2001; Mollard \n2001). By focusing upon the specifically geographical influences over asylum \nsector intermediaries, this article moves beyond discourse as a governmental \nstrategy, bestowing spacings and timings with equally pervasive, and perhaps \nmore subtle, governmental agency. \n \nOne particular contribution of the research is to recognise and conceptualise \napparently powerful and autonomous actors, such as judges and immigration \nofficers, as subject to certain forms of state-justified ideational conditioning \nthemselves. In this reading, the powerful also experience power and \n\u2018authorities\u2019 (Rose and Miller 1992) are also subject to authority. The \nsubjugation of asylum seekers in the UK is consequently shown to be not only \n 4\nbrought about through the exertion of power over asylum seekers directly (see \nSchuster 2005), but also by the steering of those intermediaries with \nautonomous authority over them, rendering these actors pivotal sites of \ncontestation, and potential sites of resistance. \n \nAnother contribution is to illuminate a shift occurring within the state between \ndifferent forms of power. In response to the increasing accountability of state \nactors, the devolution and decentralisation of formal control typifies modern \ngovernmental rule. However, this article draws attention to forms of power that \ndo not over-rule individual interests, or even appeal to them, but actively re-\nwrite them in a range of ways (Foucault 1977; Lukes 2005). This is achieved \nthrough the temporal and spatial presentation of asylum seekers to those with \n(new found) authority over them in ways that are unflattering, damaging or \ndefamatory. This notion of presentational state power offers one way in which \nnotions of governmentality can be combined with political-economic theories of \nstate power to offer innovative insights into contemporary forms of state rule. \n \nPresentational state power \n \nForced migration scholars are divided over the ability of states to control \nmigration flows. Transnationalists emphasize the constraints preventing the \nassertion of state control in the migration arena, the symbolic character of \nborder policies and the structural global difficulties states face in overcoming \nthese challenges (Castles 2006; Koser 2007; Koser and Pinkerton 2002; see also \nUrry 2007; Van Hear 2002). In contrast, others react against the dismissal of the \nstate within forced migration studies. First, a number of quantitative studies \nunderscore the enduring influence of asylum policy over applications, albeit \nwhilst recognizing that different policies have differing effects (Cornelius and \nRosenblum 2004; Hatton and Williamson 2004; Jennissen 2005; Neumayer \n2004; Thielemann 2004). Second, socio-linguistic theorists draw attention to the \nfact that the very notion of the refugee as a stateless figure implicitly ratifies the \nstate, which remains conspicuous by its absence when imagining \u2018lacking\u2019 and \n\u2018needy\u2019 refugees (Malkki 1996; Turton 2003). \n \nA third critique of transnationalism is that is misrepresents the state itself. While \nemphasising the transnationalisation of migrant communities, transnationalists \nhave, in contrast, continued to employ a strikingly static, non-relational \nimagination of states as containers of power (Allen 2003; Taylor 2003). They \nhave consequently overlooked how state power itself can internationalise, states \ncan appropriate new global means, and globalisation can enable the \ntransmission of state power beyond traditional territorial confines (Jessop 2002; \nLarner 2007). Here, states are not so much superseded or over-ruled by global \nspatial transformations, but are rescaled both locally and internationally through \ncontingent processes of de- and re-territorialisation (Brenner 1999; 2004). \n \n 5\nForced migration scholars writing in this vein have drawn attention to the ability \nof states to direct asylum flows at \u2018arm\u2019s length\u2019 through an array of \nintermediary figures. This is achieved through \u2018remote control\u2019 strategies aimed \nat the enrolment of discretionary, dispersed, non-state and quasi-state actors into \nstate-orchestrated and state-managed (but not state-executed) practices of \nasylum seeker exclusion (Guiraudon 2003; 2004; Lahav 1998). For example, \nLahav and Guiraudon (2000) outline the \u2018exteriorisation\u2019 of state control over \nasylum migration through three inter-related strategies - upward, downward and \noutward divestment of responsibility from the central state. \u2018Upwardly\u2019, the \nEuropeanization of asylum control through international consultation and \ninformation sharing, police co-operation and shared databases (Guiraudon 2000; \nLavernex 2001), the continuing roll-out of visa regimes (Guild 2002; 2006; \nNeumayer 2006), and even co-operation with countries of origin in repatriating \nrefused asylum seekers (Schieffer 2003) is a process that has been underway for \nat least two decades (Anderson and Den Boer 1994; Guild 2000). \n\u2018Downwardly\u2019, local government has extended its activities in checking the \nlegal status of immigrants, providing welfare support for asylum seekers \nawaiting decisions, incarcerating asylum seekers deemed to be at risk of \nabsconding, issuing papers necessary for visa applications, exercising discretion \nwith regard to family and marital on-migration, and administrating regionally \nspecific naturalisation laws (Cohen 2002; Groenendijk 2002; Guiraudon 2001; \nHargreaves et al. 2005). \u2018Outwardly\u2019, the fines facing private transport \ncompanies, private individuals and, in some cases, failed asylum seekers \nthemselves, have shifted the burden of responsibility for migration controls \naway from the public sector (Guiraudon 2004).   \n \n\u2018Exteriorisation\u2019 exemplifies state rescaling in the face of global pressures \n(Brenner 1999), and is a corrective to the territorial, containerised image of \nstates that transnationalism evokes. Brenner (2004) problematises the \nassumption that state power is uniformly distributed across social space within \njurisdictional units, raising the possibility that sub-national-scale customisation \nmay be explicitly pursued to further nation-state legitimacy. In the case of \nasylum migration to the UK for example, the decentralisation of responsibility \nfor asylum seekers has produced a differential geography of asylum \nmanagement corresponding to broader asymmetric devolutionary strategies \nacross England, Scotland and Wales (Sim and Bowes 2007). These differences \nare not only important to the fortunes of individual asylum seekers, but are \nillustrative of deeper processes of negotiation occurring in and around the \ncentral state as it re-organises its competencies and responsibilities with \nregional partners (Agnew 2001). In an attempt to demonstrate its decline, \ntransnationalist literatures that deal with the nation-state may overlook these \ncontested sub- and supra-state geographies. \n \nThe notion of \u2018exteriorisation\u2019 of state power, however, encounters two further \ndifficulties. Given the increasing social dispersion of responsibilities for asylum \nmigration control, it becomes necessary to ask from where these responsibilities \n 6\nare exteriorised. If distant, non-state actors are increasingly undertaking the \npractices of asylum seeker management, then tracing their motivation back to an \nessentialised, co-ordinating central state begins to appear increasingly unlikely, \nand the distinction between \u2018state\u2019 and \u2018non-state\u2019 spheres begins to look \ndecidedly imposed (Mitchell 1999). \n \nA possible resolution here is to draw the strategic-relational distinction between \nspatial state strategies and spatial state projects (Brenner 2004; Jessop 1990). \nSpatial state projects refer to activities aimed at the territorial administrative re-\norganisation of the state itself, while spatial state strategies refer to spatially-\nmediated interventions of the state into the socio-economic sphere. A key \ndistinction between state activities that target the state and target society \nemerges, producing a graduated metaphor of concentric rings of state-ness (for a \nrelated discussion, see Painter 2007). While there is, in reality, no state centre, \nthe distinction between projects and strategies highlights the grey, negotiated \nboundary between state and society. It also maintains the possibility that third \nsector social organisations might be co-opted into pursuing state aspirations, \nforming a so-called \u2018shadow state\u2019 operating within society and yet furthering \nstate interests (Wolch 1990). The closeness between the state and Refugee \nAction and the Refugee Council for example, the two major charitable bodies \nwith concern for asylum seekers\u2019 and refugees\u2019 welfare in the UK, through \ncontractual agreements to provide signposting and information services in \nexchange for financial support, certainly indicates the inadequacy of viewing \nthe state and the third sector separately in the asylum context. \n \nWhile the distinction between state projects and strategies goes so far however, \na second difficulty with the exteriorisation thesis is that the key mechanisms \nthrough which intermediaries\u2019 allegiance to state objectives are secured are \nassumed to be legal and financial (see for example Guiraudon and Joppke \n2001). This privileging of particular means through which states compel \ndisparate intermediary actors to carry out the processes of asylum management \nimplies that the extent to which state power over asylum flows is genuinely \nexteriorised, rather than simply extended, becomes questionable. If \nintermediaries are coerced or compelled to act in particular ways through legal \nand financial means, then their autonomy and separation from the state appears \nfallacious. \n \nThe account of exteriorisation consequently leaves no room for genuine \nautonomy among intermediaries, even as it charts their increasing importance. \nBy tracing their behaviour back to the state\u2019s legal-coercive or financial-\nmanipulative influence, alternative influences over intermediaries\u2019 conduct \nremain under-researched. Intermediaries are seen as state functionaries despite \ntheir responsibilities, mechanically responding to legal and financial state \ndisciplines. Yet a range of empirical studies demonstrate the genuine increase in \nresponsibility and autonomy that front-line government officials, alongside non-\nstate actors, are having to assume as central government shies from the political \n 7\nrisk associated with asylum control (D\u00fcvell and Jordan 2003; Granhag et al. \n2005; Schuster 2005; Weber and Gelsthorpe 2000. See Section Two for a fuller \nreview). Hence, while Lahav and Guiraudon (2000) rightly identified the \nincreasing prominence of front-line intermediaries, their tendency to explain \ntheir conduct exclusively in terms of legal and financial state discipline obscures \nthe emerging question of what, precisely, seeks to determine the volitional \nconduct of this group? \n \nThe argument presented below therefore builds upon Lahav and Guiraudon\u2019s \n(2000) identification of the trend towards the empowerment of autonomous \nintermediaries, by dispensing with the contradictory impulse to subsequently \nexplain their behaviour in blunt legal or financial terms. Rather, it is necessary \nto recognise that alongside coercive (legal) and manipulative (financial) forms \nof state power, states also command powers that are capable of engendering the \nwill to act in accordance with state objectives, rather than simply generating the \nnecessity or imperative to do so (Allen 2003; Gramsci 1971; Lukes 2005; Scott \n2001). By conceiving of timings and spacings as factors that can determine the \ndispositions of actors, the research draws upon governmentality studies that \nhighlight the suggestive, perceptual qualities of time and space (Elden 2007; \nHannah 2000; Huxley 2007; Larner and Walters 2004). Moreover, by \nrecognising that strategic temporal and spatial positioning can influence \ncognition and preferences, psycho-geographical currents within and beyond \ngeography are also invoked (J\u00fcngst 2000). \n \nThe strategic geographic positioning of subjects in time and space has not been \nlinked to governmental influences over the aspirations of decision makers in the \npast as a result of Foucauldians\u2019 ambivalence about \u2018the state\u2019 as a conceptual \ncategory. Work that examines the use of space in the achievement of neo-liberal \nstate aspirations, for example, generally retains the view that state actors\u2019 \ninterests and aspirations are exogenous to the state projects and strategies \nundertaken (Brenner 2004). This is because Foucault famously rejected the state \nas a useful categorisation of society, despite his regular use of the concept \n(Jessop 2007a), driving a wedge between work that addresses the techniques \nused to determine conduct and work that examines state power (Jessop 2007b). \nDespite Rose and Miller\u2019s (1992) call, nearly twenty years ago, to attend to the \n\u2018governmentalisation of the state\u2019, Foucauldians\u2019 suspicion of the state concept \nhas resulted in a more general unwillingness to attribute governmental strategies \nto calculative, pre-meditating agents. As Foucault writes, \u2018\u2026 there is no power \nthat is exercised without a series of aims and objectives. But this does not mean \nthat it results from the choice or decision of an individual subject \u2026 [T]he logic \nis perfectly clear, the aims decipherable, and yet it is often the case that no-one \nis there to have invented them\u2019 (Foucault 1980, p94-5). \n \nWhile it is certainly true that the state represents a clumsy way to describe \nsocial reality (Mitchell 1999; Peck 2004), what the Foucauldian rejection of a \ncentral, calculative agent has achieved is a timidity about identifying pre-\n 8\nmeditating political agency when discussing governmental power. One way to \navoid disassociating governmentality and pre-meditated political strategies is to \nrecognise that, even if we reject the state as a pre-social entity, we are still faced \nwith the fact that a great many social practices are undertaken in its name \n(Gupta 1995). In this reading, the state functions as an organising principle, an \nidea that becomes a metric in the ideational enrolment of autonomous subjects, \ncompeting for their allegiance and justifying practices that conform to \u2018its\u2019 \nimagined aspirations (Painter 2006). Hence, the state itself becomes a \u2018regime \nof truth\u2019 that can mobilise free and volitional actors to perform \u2018state\u2019 practices \nand promulgate \u2018state\u2019 logics. State power in this sense arises from the \nvolitional actions that allegiance to the state as an idea or social principle \nprecipitates. Organising the social world so that is appears to constitute two \nseparate spheres, state and social, allows \u2018the state\u2019 to be utilised as a concept \nthat can justify behaviour that complements this view of the world. In this vein, \nPainter (2006) discusses \u2018statisation\u2019 as the process by which the state as a \njustification for social practice is extended through society. The temporal and \nspatial techniques identified here can be interpreted as the means through which \nthis promulgation occurs (Painter, 2006). Crucially, because the state here relies \nupon embodiment and enactment in practice (Mountz 2003) \u2013 indeed it exists in \nno other form \u2013 the state\u2019s presentational power is eminently resistible, \nprecisely because it rests upon the allegiance of critically reflexive actors to the \nidea of the state itself. It is therefore not the intention here to close down \npossibilities to resistance to state power (as some Foucauldian analyses might), \nbut, on the contrary, to highlight the contingency of state power upon the \ncontestable perceptions and loyalties of powerful intermediaries. \n \nThe unifying theme here is that actors who are subject to state power are not \nnecessarily forced, compelled, disciplined or incentivised to act, but can be \nideationally conditioned to freely choose to conduct themselves in ways that are \nnevertheless particular and constrained. This is a characteristically Foucauldian \nsuggestion, and yet it is the state that commands these abilities. A marriage \nbetween Foucauldian and state theoretic approaches is therefore necessary in \norder to understand intermediaries\u2019 role in forced migration management, \nhowever belatedly. In what follows, the suggestive, presentational importance \nof the institutionalised timing and spacing of state activities not only for the \nsubjugated but also for those who wield significant discretion over asylum \nseekers is examined. \n \nIncreasing discretion among intermediaries \n \nThere are at least two reasons why asylum sector intermediaries are \nexperiencing greater genuine discretion over asylum seekers in the UK. First, \nlocalised discretion is becoming more necessary for systemic stability in the \nface of increasing local difference and complexity (Jessop 2004; Weber and \nGelsthorpe 2000). This is a commonly-cited argument for devolution in general \n(see Oates 1972; Tiebout 1956). Second, the increasing political riskiness \n 9\nassociated with asylum migration renders the vesting of real authority in \nintermediary figures an increasingly attractive political strategy in order to \navoid central state culpability. While the negative link between asylum \nmigration and a government\u2019s popularity is firmly established (Milne and Travis \n2002; Schuster and Solomos 2004; Swank and Betz 2003), when disaster strikes \nit is nevertheless useful to have a scapegoat to hand. The damage that public and \nmedia disasters can inflict3 can be significantly abated if intermediate figures, \nsuch as \u2018incompetent\u2019, privately contracted managers of a detention centre or \n\u2018corrupt\u2019 immigration officials, can be shown to have acted inadequately or \nimproperly in their own right, thereby assuaging system-wide culpability \n(Weber 2003). This argument is one example of a general tendency to exploit \nthe political expediency of devolution in a wide variety of countries (Rodr\u00edguez-\nPose and Gill 2005). \n \nA range of policy-focused work consequently documents the degree to which \nspecific intermediaries have gained increasing, genuine responsibilities for, and \ninfluence over, asylum seeker experiences (Cohen 2002; D\u00fcvell and Jordan \n2003; Granhag et al. 2005; Weber 2003). The enrolment of a wide variety of \n\u2018experts\u2019, for example, from anthropologists to language analysts, in order to \ndetermine the \u2018truth\u2019 or \u2018falsity\u2019 of an asylum seeker\u2019s claims during their \nasylum interviews, has been argued to place unreasonable demands of judgment \nupon such actors (Corcoran 2004). The importance of subjective belief among \nimmigration officials, and the consequent imperative to train migration board \nmembers to distinguish \u2018lying\u2019 from \u2018truth-telling\u2019 through \u2018education \nconcerning deception detection\u2019 has been outlined (Granhag et al. 2005 p29). \nAmong American immigration border officials, the suggestive effect of prior \nknowledge, including past judgements pertaining to un-related cases, has been \nargued to impact upon their discretionary judgements (Gilboy, 1991). Similarly \nin the UK, Weber (2003) notes the high degree of discretion in the absence of \nbinding rules at the border. One immigration officer confides the following: \n \nI decide myself. Yes there are criteria, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly \nclear or helpful. I think they\u2019re all very vague and it is really the \n[immigration official] at the end of the day who makes the decision \n \nWeber and Gelsthorpe, 2000, p63 \n \nThe four intermediaries who form the focus of this study are no exception: each \nhas experienced increasing responsibility in recent years. Caseworkers at Lunar \nHouse receive just eleven days of training, followed by eleven days of \nmentoring, before they are authorised to determine cases. Their competence has \n                                                 \n3 Recent examples include the mistaken release of hundreds of convicted criminal migrants who \nshould have been deported under British law (BBC News Online 2006a), the employment of \nillegal asylum seekers in Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) offices, recorded \nevidence that immigration officers have exchanged immigration status for sexual favours (BBC \nNews Online, 2006b), and apparent ignorance of, or reluctance to estimate, the number of illegal \nimmigrants in the UK (BBC News Online, 2005). \n 10\ncome under strict review from the UNHCR, which carried out a quality \ninitiative review of asylum decision making in the UK in 2004 and 2005 \n(United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) 2005) and expressed \nconcerns that \n \nSome established caseworkers may lack, or not be equipped with, the \nnecessary skills and knowledge for refugee status determination. The \nUNHCR has found widespread use of weak analysis, poor written English, \nand limited or non-existent research. \nUNHCR, 2005, p 11 \n \nCaseworkers are nevertheless commanding greater discretion than in the past, \nprimarily as a result of the merging of interviewer and caseworker functions \nunder the \u2018New Asylum Model\u2019 (NAM) introduced by the Home Office \nbetween 2005 and 2007 (Home Office 2006b;  see also Refugee Council 2007). \nCommenting upon the devolutionary aspects of NAM in 2006, one senior IND \nofficial outlined her aspirations for the new system: \n \nSource 1: At the moment we\u2019re a very silo based organisation so people in \nLiverpool or Sheffield or Birmingham are reporting to someone who\u2019s \nlocated in Croydon [London] and we want to change that and actually \nhave regional areas so all of our functions across the silos if you like will \nreport to the regional director. They will have a huge amount of autonomy \nand flexibility. We will give them a framework and then within that they \nwill be leading their regions \u2026 \n \nOne specific implication of NAM is that interviews and the paperwork for each \nasylum seeker is conducted by the same person. The separation of the role of \ninterviewer from decision maker is disbanded so that caseworkers carry out both \nthe interview and the paperwork associated with the determination of asylum \nseekers\u2019 claims. NAM consequently increases the concentration of \nresponsibility into the hands of a smaller number of intermediaries. \u2018The \ninterview is deemed [to be] the most important occasion when asylum seekers \ncan put forward their cases\u2019 (Cwerner 2004, p81). The new responsibilities for \nasylum interviewing that accrue to caseworkers under NAM therefore represent \na substantial increase in their authorised discretion. \n \nNASS employees determine the eligibility of asylum seekers for financial \nsupport during their time in the UK based on a paper application that has been \ncompleted by, or on behalf of, the asylum seeker. They then decide whether or \nnot an asylum seeker is entitled to housing and financial support during the \nprocessing of their claim, subject to the conditions that they have applied for \nasylum, are facing destitution and have applied for asylum \u2018as soon as \nreasonably practicable\u2019 once they have arrived in the UK. Before the creation of \nNASS, local authorities and the benefits agency were the first ports of call for \nasylum seekers. The fact that local authorities were responsible for the welfare \nof asylum seekers meant that localities and regions were meeting the demand \nfor asylum support unequally across the UK. London was receiving over 80% of \n 11\nthe claims for support in 1999. NASS aimed to equalise the asylum \u2018burden\u2019 \nacross regions by making the financial support an asylum seeker is entitled to \nconditional upon their acceptance of allocated housing, which is primarily \nlocated in Scotland, the West Midlands and the North West: well away from the \ncapital. \nNASS employees have experienced greater discretion in recent years by virtue \nof the fact that, until 2000, their present role did not exist at all. Rather, local \ngovernment authorities were charged with the responsibility of supporting \nasylum seekers and there was no systematic, nation-wide procedure for \ndetermining genuine cases for financial support. \n \nA key aim in setting up NASS was to separate out the services to asylum \nseekers and provide them in a way that \u2026 discourage[d] abuse of a \nchronically overstretched system. \nNoble, Barnish et al. 2004, p50 \nIn other words, the very decision about whether or not to support an asylum \nseeker was institutionalised with the introduction of NASS, meaning that the \ngenesis of NASS employees\u2019 roles itself represents an increase in discretionary \npower. \n \nImmigration judges are charged with the responsibility of determining asylum \nappeals against negative initial decisions within set time limits. The increase in \nresponsibility that judges are presently experiencing derives from the fact that \nan increasingly high number (around 15%) of original applications for asylum \nare not determined correctly (Home Office 2006a; Nicol 2004). The appeals \nprocess that judges administer has become part of the application process itself, \nexceeding its originally intended function as an exceptional procedure in \ndifficult cases (Byrne et al. 2003). \n \nRemoval centre managers are responsible for asylum seekers\u2019 welfare as they \nawait deportation following the refusal of their claim. There are rules by which \nremoval centres must abide in the UK, although they are often loosely defined. \nFor example, on the use of force in detention centres, the rules stipulate only \nthat, \n \nA detainee custody officer dealing with a detained person shall not use \nforce unnecessarily and, when necessary, no more force than is \nnecessary shall be used. \n \n\u2018Detention Centre Rules\u2019, Immigration and Nationality Directorate, 2001 \n \nThis lack of clarity has led to repeated allegations concerning the misuse of \nforce in detention and removal centres (See, for example, Medical Foundation \nof the Care of Victims of Torture (MFCVT) 2004). \n \n 12\nAs a result of the looseness of the rules surrounding detention and removal of \nasylum seekers in the UK, a situation that stems partly from its location within \ncivil, rather than criminal law (see Agamben 2005 for a discussion of the \npitfalls of this sort of exceptionalism), centre managers hold an extraordinary \ndegree of influence and discretion over individual incarcerated asylum seekers. \nAs one pro-asylum detention centre employee outlined, referring to the group of \nemployees sympathetic to incarcerated asylum seekers working in removal \ncentres in the UK: \nSource 2: Those of us \u2026 who are involved with human rights know that we \n... do a great deal for asylum seekers. We have been able to arrange for \nluggage to be collected, arranged new lawyers, medical appointments, \nphone cards, money for some being deported, clothes. We have provided \nfor festivities and have a supply of Bibles, Q\u2019urans and other faith literature \nto give away. We have contacted detainees\u2019 families, and have given those \nbeing sent to NASS accommodation addresses of churches or refugee \nsupport groups where they can get help and advice. We have contacted \norganisation such as Jesuit Refugee Service about those being deported so \nthat they have some support on their return. \n \nAs a measure of the increasing discretion of removal centre managers, the \nnumber of incarcerated asylum seekers in the UK has increased rapidly from \n250 in 1993 to over 2500 in 2005 (Bacon 2005). Given that the detention estate \nconsistently operates at or near capacity and that the average length of \nincarceration is only around two weeks, this represents an exponential increase \nin the number of asylum seekers who experience detention every year. \nIncreasing discretion among asylum sector intermediaries is not uniform and \nthere are examples of countervailing tendencies. Complaints within the \nimmigration system about red tape are a long-standing feature (Montgomery \nand Le Feuvre 2000). Generally however, the increasing discretion of \nintermediaries represents the business end of political risk delegation in the \nasylum management sector, and deserves closer scrutiny. There is a need to \nexamine how intermediaries decide to implement their discretion, to determine \nwhat factors influence their decisions and to identify which forces seek to shape \ntheir conduct, beyond legal and financial state disciplines. \nTime as a presentational technique \n \nThe appropriation of time as a political strategy has become a topic of intense \nscrutiny in the social sciences (Armitage 2001; Castells 2000; Virilio 1986). \u2018In \nthe context of recent developments in asylum policy and process, especially in \nthe UK, time has been fore-grounded as a major dimension and resource upon \nwhich some agents deem appropriate to exert power\u2019 manifesting in the \u2018fast-\ntracking\u2019, \u2018streamlining\u2019 and \u2018speeding up\u2019 of the asylum process (Cwerner, \n2004, p73). The strategic use of time is reflected in the institutional rhythms of \ngovernment agencies throughout the UK asylum sector. The fact that agencies \n 13\nand organisations rise and fall with such rapidity, including both the IND and \nNASS that formed the subject of this research in 2006 and have since either \nbeen renamed or are in the processes of being relabelled, produces a constantly \nshifting, bewildering institutional landscape that frustrates asylum seekers and \nasylum activists alike. \n \nSource 3: The first asylum legislation specifically to do with the asylum \nprocess was 93, then it was 96, 99, 2002, 2004 and now we\u2019ve got the 2006 \nbill so there will be a 2006 act because they\u2019re tinkering with a system that \ndoesn\u2019t work4 \n \nThe mobilisation of change as a constant facet of government policy is clearly \nin evidence as the asylum sector exhibits the sort of \u2018policy churn\u2019 (Hess 1998) \nthat is characteristic of neo-liberal institutional cultures. At Lunar House, the \nconstantly changing policy climate has produced an alarming backlog of asylum \nclaims. \n \nSource 4: As soon as the new piece of legislation comes into force the \npeople from the previous pieces, who are still under the previous pieces of \nlegislation end up going towards the back of the queues because the new \nlegislation gets implemented first, staff are retrained and new staff members \nare taken on to deal with the latest legislation. There is a real problem then \nfor people who are still waiting for answers or had their last decision before \nthis came into force because the teams dealing with the previous regimes \nare much smaller. Now, shockingly, we have still got people who came in \nbefore 1993 and haven\u2019t had a first decision (laughs). \nCaseworkers face tight deadlines, strict targets and monotonous work schedules. \nThe time taken to complete the paperwork for determining asylum claims, \nwhich constitutes the bulk of the paperwork carried out at Lunar House, should \nbe thirty minutes, a target that is strictly monitored on an individual basis \nwithout the possibility of roll-over to subsequent weeks or months (Back et al. \n2005). The queues at Lunar House act as a constant, symbolic reminder of the \npaucity of time. Queues begin to form as early as 5am every day and are divided \ninto two sections, one for those routinely renewing visas or passports, which \noften reaches five hours in length, the other for asylum seekers who queue for \neven longer (National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaigns (NCADC) \n2003). \nThese time pressures affect the work that is carried out at Lunar House in a \nnumber of ways. One third of employees experienced stress \u2018often\u2019, \u2018very often\u2019 \nor \u2018always\u2019 in comparison to under 14% in the UK economy as a whole (Home \n                                                 \n4 The interviewee is referring to the Asylum Immigration and Appeals Act 1993, Asylum and \nImmigration Act 1996, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997, the \nImmigration and Asylum Act 1999, the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the \nAsylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 and the Immigration, Asylum \nand Nationality Act 2006. \n \n 14\nOffice Staff Survey 2004, in Back et al. 2005; Health and Safety Executive \n2007) with serious consequences for employees: \nSource 5: There are real issues to do with secondary trauma for staff \nmembers. The way people cope with hearing stories that are really quite \ndifficult to hear is, if they\u2019re not getting adequate support themselves, to burn \nout or else shut down. It comes to a stage for some people the only way that \nyou can deal with this is to shut down and say \u2018this can\u2019t be happening, they\u2019re \nall liars\u2019. Having said that, when there are fewer people waiting outside for \nlong periods of time there seems to be a much more welcoming attitude on \nthe inside. \n \nDespite the effects of the intense time pressures and long queues in generating \nnegative perceptions of asylum seekers among staff, however, senior staff are \nreluctant to introduce changes. One senior manager at the Immigration and \nNationality Directorate emphasised the constraints that time, stress and the need \nto minimise workloads impose upon innovation. New ideas could be expected \nto \nSource 1: Increase stress and increase workloads, disrupting the workflow. If \n\u2026 we had to implement [new ideas] within a particular timeframe I think there \nwould be some real constraints in terms of financial cost. \n \nAs a result of continuing time pressures over staff, one charity-funded report \ninto Lunar House recorded harsh, tense and aggressive treatment of claimants \n(Back et al. 2005). \nAlthough many staff carry out their difficult work patiently and diligently, there \nare disturbing stories of harsh and inappropriate behaviour. Some staff may \nbecome case-hardened and take out their frustration on the public. Others \nmay harbour negative attitudes which remained unchallenged. Whatever the \ncause, the frequency of comments is a cause for concern. \nBack, Farrell et al. 2005, p34 \nOstensibly powerful caseworkers at Lunar House can, in these ways, become \nsubject to the institutionalised timing of their encounters with asylum seekers in \ntheir own right. \n \nStaff are under so much pressure \u2013 not just the targets, but keeping on top of \nthe pressure that\u2019s put on them. They\u2019re at the front line of national concern \nand they have to deal with the psychic [sic] burden. \n \nPersonal Testimony, Back, Farrell et al. 2005, p63 \nFor NASS employees, the temporal techniques through which they encounter \nthe asylum seekers over whom they command discretionary authority are \n 15\nclearly active in structuring their conduct. NASS employees work in regional \noffices located around the UK. There are twelve offices in total that were \ncreated as part of the devolution of NASS between 2003 and 2005. \n \nThese offices compete to minimise the amount of time taken to determine \napplications for welfare support. The reception area and office notice-board at \nthe South West office, for example, were dominated by correspondence from \nNASS headquarters emphasising the imperative to reduce the backlog of \noutstanding claims and celebrating the increasing number of fraudulent \nclaimants detected both by the IND and by NASS. One of the pieces of \ncorrespondence on display was a \u2018Regionalisation Newsletter\u2019 informing \nemployees at the regional offices of NASS\u2019 progress in implementing the drive \ntowards regionalisation (Table Three). \n \nTable Three: Extract from NASS' Regionalisation Newsletter \nTeam Standard Casework - \nactual average time \ntaken. \n[Target 55 minutes]. \nFast Track - actual \naverage time taken. \n[Target 39 minutes]. \nLeeds 24.00 23.17 \nGlasgow 30.44 27.55 \nDover 24.34 29.41 \nLondon 47.34 31.38 \nNewcastle Training  \nPeterborough Training  \nManchester 56.15 47.24 \nSolihull 41.06 32.04 \n \n 16\nThe extract compares the average time taken to decide upon a claim for support \nreceived by NASS in the various places that host regional NASS offices. The \noffices are under extreme time constraints to meet the target times of 55 minutes \nfor standard cases and 39 minutes for those on the \u2018fast track\u20195. What is more, \nregionalisation has introduced a high degree of competition between regional \noffices on this metric. The Leeds office, for example, received praise in the \nnewsletter for being the fastest at determining cases, completing the work in less \nthan half the time allocated for standard cases. \nThe scripting of asylum seekers\u2019 cases for welfare support in numeric and time-\nsensitive ways creates an artificial informational environment within which \ndecision-makers are under pressure to reach conclusions quickly. Asylum \nseekers are represented to NASS employees in simplistic, sanitised ways \nthrough this process. The distillation of a decision regarding an asylum seeker\u2019s \nclaim into a minute-and-second count violently abstracts from the personal \ncircumstances that underwrite each claim. This threatens to allow the \nsubjectivity, complexity and case-specificity of the practice of determining \ncases for welfare support to be overlooked. NASS employees, as a result, \nthemselves become subject to the presentation of asylum seekers that the \ntemporal institutional organisation of their interaction with them allows. One \ninterviewee complained about \u2018playing God\u2019 with asylum seekers claims in the \nabsence of adequate time to consider their cases. \nThe way in which asylum seekers are depicted to immigration judges is \ninfluenced by the institutionalised rationing of time in a different way. Since \nApril 2004, immigration lawyers\u2019 time has been systematically squeezed as a \nresult of new legislation that limits the amount of hours that they are permitted \nto spend on any immigration case. Judges, who rely upon lawyers\u2019 \nrepresentations to be able to accurately determine cases, consequently hear \nprogressively less thorough cases because lawyers are unable to devote as much \ntime to preparing, collating evidence, rehearsing their arguments, editing their \nsubmissions, consulting their clients and conducting research to support their \nrepresentations (Cutler and Wren 2005). Expressing her frustration at what she \nsaw as inadequate funding to prepare asylum cases for immigration judges, one \nlawyer in Bristol stated that: \n \nSource 6: What I would like to do is improve the public funding. It has got \nmore and more restricting, so that people\u2019s representatives end up spending \neither lots of time unpaid in order to prepare a case or they don\u2019t prepare a \ncase properly. The way it is at the moment, if you\u2019ve got a difficult asylum \ncase, I don\u2019t see how you could possibly do it justice within the hours that they \nsay we should be able to do it. \n                                                 \n5 There is a fast-track procedure for claimants coming from so-called \u2018White List\u2019 countries i.e. \ncountries that have been deemed to be generally safe by the Home Office, meaning that claims \nfor asylum from these countries are viewed as manifestly unfounded. \n 17\nOne implication of the changes in legislation is that unscrupulous lawyers, who \nare prepared to do a bad job and make the work pay, are beginning to dominate \nthe market, again impacting upon the sort of representations of asylum seekers \nthat judges are likely to encounter. As one lawyer outlined: \nSource 7: Some solicitors have been really unscrupulous and were seeing \nthese [asylum seekers] for maybe 5, 10 minutes, sketchily writing out their \ncase history and then putting in that they\u2019d sat with them for you know days \nand days and days. \n \nAnother interviewee made the following comments: \nSource 8: They are cutting down on legal aid for immigration.  Not only have \nthey cut down on the total amount given, they have cut down on the \nnumber of solicitors they have authorised to do the work and more and more \nsolicitors are withdrawing because the legal aid allowed is inadequate. So \nsolicitors have to make the decision - do we work for free in order to do this \nwork or are we prepared to do half a job \u2018cos that\u2019s all we\u2019re being paid to \ndo. \nLegal representation is carried out so that judges, who are charged with the \nresponsibility of determining the legitimacy of an asylum appeal, can make an \ninformed decision. Hence, the perceptions of judges are systematically affected \nby the control and restriction of the supply of legal aid. It is immigration judges \nwho experience the effects of recent moves to curb legal aid funding, because \nasylum claims are presented to them under specifically controlled conditions \nthat restrict the quality of the depictions made. We are, therefore, able to view \nimmigration judges, as well as asylum seekers themselves, as subject to recent \nlegislation that constricts legal aid funding. This breeds animosity towards \njudges and alienation among asylum seekers who rely upon their objectivity: \nSource 9: I am telling you - don\u2019t believe the judge, because the judges, \nimmigration judges I mean, they are working with the government, the Home \nOffice is against asylum seekers \u2026 I don\u2019t care about them, I don\u2019t care, \nbecause I know they are all rubbish, they are all lying. I ignore them. \n \nFollowing the changes to legal aid in 2004, both the proportion of initial claims \nand appeals that are unsuccessful increased. In the last quarter of 2002, 68% of \nclaims were refused at the first sitting and, of those who appealed, 77% were \nrefused on appeal (Home Office 2002). By the first quarter of 2005, 88% of \ninitial claims were dismissed at the first hearing, and, of those who appealed, \n82% were overruled (Home Office 2005). \nIn general, the institutionalised timing of the interaction between asylum seekers \nand intermediaries threatens to structure the ways in which they exercise their \ndiscretion. Caseworkers, NASS employees and immigration judges rely upon \nthe institutional rhythms within which they are situated to allow them to make \ninformed, objective choices. The rationing of time threatens to disallow this \n 18\nopportunity. The intermediaries themselves are consequently affected by the \ntemporal strategies that they experience, which serve to depict the asylum \nseekers under their authority to them in ways that encourage exclusionary uses \nof the discretion they wield. \nSpace as a presentational technique \nNot only time, but also space, is increasingly recognised as an important \ndeterminant of the ways in which discretionary power is exerted (Allen 2003). \nThe figures of authority that form the basis of this study are subject to the \ninfluence of particular institutionalised spatial arrangements that serve to \nseparate, distance, defamiliarise and sever them from the asylum seekers over \nwhich they hold discretion. \nThe security measures that are considered necessary at Lunar House in order to \nsafely manage the asylum seekers that use the building result in the production \nof asylum seekers as a separate and threatening category, which can impact \nupon the work that caseworkers undertake. Asylum seekers queue separately \nwhilst waiting for their interviews, in queues that are longer, more heavily \npoliced and less sheltered than the queues that \u2018economic\u2019 migrants occupy6. \nOnce they reach the head of the queue they are separated from interviewers by \nmeans of a protective plastic screen and are prevented from drawing closer to \nthe screen by chairs that are bolted into position (Back 2006). As one employee \ncommented: \n \nSource 5: Why do these chairs have to be bolted to the floor? It\u2019s to stop \npeople throwing them through the window! They need to be as far away \nfrom the counter as possible! \n \nThis means that they often have to raise their voices in a public room in order to \nrecount their cases for asylum, which can include harrowing accounts of their \nexperiences in their countries of origin. \n \nThese measures impact upon the asylum seekers arriving at Lunar House, \nengendering frustration and resentment. \n \nSource 10: The whole system of policing is predicated on this one simple idea \nthat moving across national borders causes a problem. And the reaction to that \nproblem is very often defensive. I think it is presupposed on the idea that \nmovement is suspect at best and at worst, that people would be better if they \nstayed in their place. \n \nIn the worst cases, the frustration that being cordoned and singled out \nengenders can result in aggressive behaviour that appears to justify the need \nfor security. \n \n                                                 \n6 There are difficulties in distinguishing between economic migrants and asylum seekers, \nalthough states continue to employ\/produce the distinction (Van Hear, 2006; Turton, 2003). \n 19\nSource 4: If you\u2019re a member of staff and you\u2019ve had five people have a go at \nyou in one morning and really get aggressive, you need that screen. But why \ndid those people get aggressive in the first place? Because the screen was \nthere! They couldn\u2019t speak properly! The seats are so far away their personal \nbusiness everybody can hear! \n \nFurthermore, even if asylum seekers are not provoked, they can become \ndespondent at the spatial segregation they experience, impacting upon the \nquality of the information that caseworkers are able to gather. The charity-\nfunded report into Lunar House cited earlier (Back et al. 2005) recounts a \nsituation in which a young female asylum seeker was making a case for asylum \nafter both her parents had been murdered in her country of origin. Sitting next \nto another claimant in the public interview room she overheard the interviewer \nrepeatedly shouting \u2018your parents are not dead!\u2019 The young woman became \nconvinced that she too was not going to be believed and became too nervous \nand agitated to give a full account of her own story (Back et al. 2005 p34). \n \nAs well as their direct influence over asylum seekers the micro-spatial security \nmeasures evident at Lunar house have the further effect of presenting asylum \nseekers to key intermediaries in specific, damaging ways. For some employees, \ntheir awareness of these conditions and their effects meant that they became \nashamed about their own working practices. One interviewee recounted the \nrationale for a former colleague quitting the IND. \n \nSource 4: He had a daughter that looked the same age as someone queuing \nand he was ashamed that he actually had to keep this kid in a locked cell \novernight. He kept going in during the night to check that she was alright \nand to see if she wanted anything to eat \u2018cos she was curled up in the foetal \nposition in the corner of the cell. \n \nOther employees, however, develop an immunity to the difficult situations they \nface, forgetting that the fact that asylum seekers may be positioned on the other \nside of a fence or screen does not mean that they can be abused. Recounting her \nexperience of queuing at Lunar House while waiting with a vulnerable asylum \nseeker, one of my interviewees recalled the inhumane treatment of claimants: \n \nSource 11: You had to stand, you weren\u2019t allowed to sit in that queue.  \nThere were old people, children, all sorts of people, people who had literally \njust come off the plane or had come off the back of a lorry: had to stand. \nOne of the officials came out and was very very abusive and there was this \npregnant woman next to me, I think she was an African woman who was I \nthink leaning against something and he came out and he just abused her \nand told her that she wasn\u2019t allowed to lean. It was dreadful. \n \nThe tragedy of this account is that the official had come to view the asylum \nseekers in his care as second class citizens, partitioned and cordoned into a \nseparate space that marked them out as different and risky. \n \n 20\nIf separation constitutes one spatial technique through which discretionary \nactors at Lunar House are influenced and directed, isolation has a similar effect \nover NASS\u2019 workforce. Since its creation in 2000, NASS was been regularly \ncriticised for its lack of accountability preferring to pay charitable sector \norganisations to provide signposting facilities rather than maintaining front desk \nfunctions themselves. The lack of a requirement to locate near asylum seekers, \nhowever, frees up the organisation so that offices could be located in relatively \nremote settings, avoiding high urban rents. NASS consequently implemented a \nregionalisation package alongside the main IND devolution drive, ostensibly to \nimprove accountability \n \nBy enhancing its representation in the Regions, NASS will be closer to its \npartners, stakeholders, and its customers and consequently will be able to \nprovide a stronger, more targeted and effective service. \nImmigration and Nationality Directorate, 2005 \nYet the South West regional NASS office indicates that the proximity of NASS \nto the asylum seekers its serves has, if anything, reduced as a result of the \nregionalisation process. The South West regional office is located in Portishead, \na town with a population of around eighteen thousand. Portishead is a seaside \nresort and a retirement town. One of my interviewees described it in the \nfollowing terms: \n \nSource 12: The housing is not cheap and I would say it is predominantly \nmiddle class ABC if you like. ABC white as well. So that\u2019s the principle make \nup of the population here. Although there has been increasing diversity of \npopulation in Portishead, that diversity I would say is still white European. \n \nIt is also a place that is deeply resistant to outside influences. When a suggestion \nwas made, in 2003, that the town became host to an asylum screening centre \nthat would have required asylum seekers to visit the local area regularly, public \nresistance was staunch, including the staging of a public meeting with national \nlevel politicians, coverage in the national press, the close involvement of the \nBNP and the hosting of a number of two-hundred strong demonstrations against \nthe proposals7. One interviewee described the atmosphere at one of these \ngatherings in the following terms: \nSource 13: I was trying to encourage the councillors to take a clear public \nplatform stand against any kind of xenophobia or racism which would come \nout, and sure enough it did come out. I was on the floor and I could hear \ncomments from the people sitting round me and the people in the rows in \nfront and behind. There was some fairly open things said as well. It ranged \n                                                 \n7 This proposal did not concern NASS directly because it has no front desk functions. Rather, \nthe proposal involved re-locating some of the IND\u2019s other activities into the area. \n 21\nfrom statements like \u201cwe don\u2019t want the likes of them here\u201d through to a \nhuge amount of implied things.  \nAs Hubbard (2005) has argued in a similar context, the community of \nPortishead is actively hostile towards anything other than pure whiteness. The \nObserver succinctly summarised the town\u2019s attitude towards foreigners in the \nheadline of its article covering the dispute surrounding the proposed screening \ncentre in Portishead: \n \nAsylum Seekers? Not here, not even for a few minutes. \nThe Observer, 25th April 2004. \n \nPortishead can therefore be seen as culturally and socially distant from the \nasylum seeking population. Given that over half the workforce in NASS\u2019 \nregional office was drawn from Portishead\u2019s local labour market, the location of \nthe office in Portishead can be expected to impact upon the attitude of NASS \nemployees. Moreover, the devolution of NASS\u2019 core functions exacerbates the \neffect of insulating and isolating NASS\u2019 employees from regular contact with \nasylum seekers themselves. One police officer in Bristol who regularly \ninteracted with asylum seeking communities in the city centre outlined the \nisolation of NASS from the day to day business of dealing with asylum seekers. \n \nSource 14: We don\u2019t have any contact with NASS. Obviously we have a \ncommunity intelligence officer at Headquarters who has a bit of contact with \nNASS about where they are, where they\u2019re located. Apart from the BRIAF \nmeeting though I have virtually no contact with NASS whatsoever, I wasn\u2019t \neven aware they had outreach, where they go what they do. \n \nAs one of the core responsibilities of NASS, the fact that this officer did not \nknow that NASS also had an outreach function that addresses the welfare of \nasylum seekers was surprising. BRIAF stands for the Bristol Refugee Inter \nAgency Forum which is a bi-monthly meeting that brings together health, \neducation and counselling charities, housing providers, government agencies \nand refugee support groups and is organised by refugees in Bristol with the aim \nof informing stakeholders in the city about the issues forced migrants face in the \ncity. In recent years, NASS\u2019 attendance at the meetings has declined. One of \nBRIAF\u2019s organisers linked this decline in participation to the regionalisation of \nNASS: \n \nSource 15: I would say NASS was very good initially, we would get someone \ncoming to BRIAF every month in one of the meetings, they would bring \nstatistics about how many refugees there are, how many asylum seekers, \nwhat are the issues. However, over the last year and a half or so I\u2019ve noticed \nthat NASS has been really not that well represented in BRIAF. Since NASS \nregionalised which is about 2 or 3 years ago [name] has a team and as such \n 22\nobviously she hasn\u2019t been always available for BRIAF. She has huge \nresponsibility which has expanded. \n \nAs one of the few ways in which NASS employees in the South West maintain \ncontact with refugees and asylum seekers, the decline in their participation \nrepresents not only a decline in support for BRIAF but also the removal of a \nspace in which NASS employees might encounter asylum seekers through more \nthan simply a set of case notes. Again, NASS employees\u2019 perceptions of asylum \nseekers are threatened by institutional arrangements, this time through the \nprocesses of isolation arising from their location within insular towns like \nPortishead and the devolution of NASS\u2019 structure. \n \nOne of the most striking features of Campsfield Removal Centre is the \ntransience of the asylum seeker population incarcerated there, not as a result of \ntheir deportation, but as a result of their movement between different \nimmigration facilities i.e. around the so-called \u2018detention estate\u2019 in the UK. The \nextent of these movements has become a striking feature of the centre at \nCampsfield. One manager who had been working at the centre for over five \nyears claimed that the total number of movements between detention centres \nwithin the detention estate in 2004-5 was 57 670, relative to just over 2500 \ndetention spaces in the UK. \n \nSource 16: They\u2019ve initiated a totally different regime which is that they don\u2019t \nwant to leave any detainees anywhere for any length of time. There are a \nfew detainees in Campsfield that have been in there for a long time, but very \nfew. They will come in and they will stay for 10 days and they will be moved \nto Harmondsworth or to Yarlswood or anywhere but it\u2019s a moving process. \nThe average stay at Campsfield now is 10 days8. \n \nThis means that individual asylum seekers often experience a variety of \ndetention facilities. \n \nSource 17: Before Campsfield House I stay long time I stay here for four \ndetentions \n \nNG: Four different detentions? \n \nSource 17: Four different detentions. My first detention is Oakington. \nOakington I stay here three days for Oakington. \n \nNG: Yes \n \nSource 17: Four months five day in Harmondsworth \n \nNG: Harmondsworth yes \n \n                                                 \n8 This interviewee has organized charitable support for the asylum seekers incarcerated in \nCampsfield Removal Centre for over ten years, including organizing visits to the detainees as \nwell as visiting them herself regularly. \n 23\nSource 17: After Harmondsworth [name] could bring me to Belmarsh prison \n \nNG: Belmarsh \n \nSource 17: Belmarsh I stay maybe one month. After Belmarsh I think I stay in \nDover. Dover detention two months four days. After Dover I go again to \nHarmondsworth one week \n \nNG: Yes \n \nSource 17: After Harmondsworth I come [name] bring me to Campsfield \nHouse \n \nNG: Yeah so your total? \n \nSource 17: Maybe the total\u2019s fifteen months in detention. \n \nThese movements are carried out as part of a reward and sanction system in an \nattempt to subdue an often unruly deportee population that consistently protests \nagainst incarceration (Hayter 2004). Campsfield\u2019s detainees have a long history \nof protest and resistance. As early as 1994 Algerian detainees went on hunger \nstrike in response to their treatment, mounting rooftop protests, flying home-\nmade banners and starting fires (Campaign to Close Campsfield 2007). In 1997 \nfifty to sixty detainees escaped into a courtyard at the centre and protested \nloudly in response to the harsh treatment of their fellow inmates. Nine of these \nprotesters were brought to trial as a result of the protests, yet embarrassingly for \nthe then-management of the centre, a public enquiry ruled that the charges \nagainst them were without foundation. Since then, Campsfield has been the site \nof hunger strikes, more rooftop protests, a catalogue of public appeals from \nwithin the centre and repeated self-harm and suicide attempts (Bacon 2005). \nThe frustration of the detainees is an on-going challenge for the centre \nmanagement. In August 2007, twenty-six detainees escaped from the centre, \nfourteen of whom evaded capture overnight (BBC News Online 2007). \n \nThe effect of the movements upon the detainees is striking. Because some \nincarceration establishments have longer hours of free association (meaning that \ndetainees are allowed to leave their rooms or corridors) and good relations \nbetween staff and detainees, while others have less free association and poorer \nrelations, the prospect of being moved to a worse detention centre acts as a \nstrong deterrent against unruly behaviour (Hayter 2004). Equally, the prospect \nof being moved to a \u2018better\u2019 detention centre acts as an incentive towards \ncompliance. \n \nNG: What did people think about that when they came back? \n \nSource 18: People is very, very content. Is OK. Maybe people is enjoy. \nBecause I told you again - Campsfield House is better detention. \n \n 24\nAs with other forms of institutionalised state spacing, however, a further effect \nof the movement of detainees is not over the detainees themselves but over the \nremoval centre staff. Centre managers need personal relationships with the \ndetainees at the centre in order to provoke them into using their considerable \ndiscretion to support the detainees. The movement of detainees undermines \ntheir opportunity to forge meaningful attachments with the detainees and \nreduces the likelihood that they will go out of their way in the future in order to \nsupport the asylum seekers they come into contact with. \n \nOne of the centre managers detailed the ways in which he used to help the \ndetainees under his authority by explaining the legal process to them during \ntheir stay in Campsfield. I asked him whether or not he ever developed an \nemotional attachment to the detainees in his care and whether he found these \nattachments challenging. \n \nSource 19: It\u2019s less difficult now because the turnover\u2019s so high. In the past \nsomeone would leave and you\u2019d wonder \u2018what happened to him?\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t \nheard from him for months, I wonder if he\u2019s still alive.\u2019 But now the turnover \nis so high that the minute someone\u2019s left there\u2019s someone who\u2019s arrived with \njust as big problems or just such nasty situations so there\u2019s always someone \nelse to help. Nasty as it sounds you very quickly forget the ones who\u2019ve just \nleft because you\u2019re onto the next batch. You have to develop a sort of \nprofessional detachment whereby you listen to them sympathetically at the \ntime and help in any way you can. But when you leave you have to leave that \nat work. If you were to take it with you I think it would be a huge obstacle \nbecause you\u2019d be useless to the next batch that comes through. \nThe presentation of asylum seekers as transient to this manager means that he is \nunable to engage with the detainees to the same extent as before the system of \nmoving detainees came into force and is consequently far less likely to use his \ninfluence to support asylum seekers at Campsfield. In general, as with Lunar \nHouse\u2019s caseworkers and NASS\u2019 employees, the geographical positioning and \nmovement of detainees within the detention estate has a significant influence \nover the ways in which managers at the centre perceive their roles and utilise \ntheir autonomy. \n \nConclusion \n \nThis article has argued, with Lahav and Guiraudon (2000), that discretionary \nauthority is becoming increasingly devolved and exteriorised in the asylum \nsector, so that intermediaries are carrying more responsibility than in the past. In \ncontrast to Lahav and Guiraudon\u2019s (2000) work, however, the article has \ndemonstrated that the increasing discretion of front-line intermediaries is not \nnecessarily legally constrained or financially curtailed. If it were, then we could \nhardly refer to it as discretion. Rather, asylum sector intermediaries have \nbecome genuinely more autonomous, allowing them to make more discretionary \njudgments over asylum seekers\u2019 welfare without reference to imposed rules or \ntop-down management guidelines. \n 25\n \nThis discretion is nevertheless steered in a variety of ways. This steering does \nnot operate through the disciplining, sanctioning or threatening of subjects \n(although the findings of this article do not rule these out). Powerful \ndiscretionary actors throughout the asylum sector are, instead, subject to a \ndifferent form of state power that literally shapes and moulds their aspirations. \nThis is achieved by presenting asylum seekers to those with discretionary \nauthority over them in damaging and defamatory ways, thereby depicting them \nas a population that is deserving of particular treatments. The subjective \npresentation of asylum seekers to those with authority over them can be seen to \nmobilise these intermediaries into treating the asylum seekers in their care \ndifferently. The roles of time and of space are crucial to this process. The \ntemporal and spatial location of asylum intermediaries and asylum seekers \nthemselves is constitutive of the depiction of asylum seekers that intermediaries \nencounter.  \n \nThe research presented here raises three further points relating to state power. \nFirstly, the research reveals an impasse that has been reached in academic \nunderstanding of the state. The shift towards presentational state power in the \nasylum sector, at the expense of blunter, more coercive or financially \nmanipulative forms of power, reflects a general trend towards the \nautonomisation and social embedding of state functions throughout society \n(Painter 2006). Yet neither structuralist nor Focauldian approaches are \nadequately equipped to comprehend this trend. On the one hand, as Lahav and \nGuiraudon\u2019s (2000) work demonstrates, structuralist notions of the state \nstruggle to account for the forms of state power that intermediaries are \nexperiencing. On the other hand however, Foucauldians have been loathe to \nattribute autonomous power to \u2018the state\u2019. The article has offered presentational \nstate power as a concept that might overcome these difficulties by taking \naccount of the struggle for the volitional allegiance of newly responsibilised \nintermediaries through the strategic presentation of the social world to them in \nways that seek to elicit uses of their discretion which conform to the notion of a \nworld that is divided into state and society. \n  \nA second consideration that arises from this research is the importance of \nconceiving of the presentational strategies described here as strategies, meaning \nthat they are not guaranteed to be successful, are prone to failure and are \neminently contestable (see Jessop, 1990). It is certainly not my intention to \nconvey hopelessness in the struggle for fairness in the asylum sector, and this \nresearch is intended to be a corrective to the sort of determinism that sees \nasylum sector decision makers as merely functionaries of either legal, financial, \nor linguistic forms of control. What the research indicates is the increasing \nstrategic importance of key asylum sector decision makers to the fortunes of \nasylum seekers. Indeed, if we conceive of the state as a symbolic force in \nsociety, then it is precisely at the level of intermediaries and their practices that \n 26\nthe state is enacted, embodied and produced, so it is also here that fruitful \nresistance might be mounted. \n \nThirdly, this should be taken as a clear warning to pro-asylum lobbyists and \npressure groups. While interested political factions have developed spatial and \ntemporal strategies that attend to the importance of intermediaries\u2019 allegiance, \nas discussed here, activists and asylum advocates have not developed strategies \naimed at the determination of intermediaries\u2019 volitional conduct, spatio-\ntemporal or otherwise, that are anywhere near as sophisticated. This may be \nbecause asylum activists continue to see asylum sector decision makers as part \nof \u2018the state\u2019 and therefore excluded them from their organising and outreach \nactivities ex ante. This would position asylum activists and advocacy \norganisations outside a key site of contestation and resistance from the outset: \nnamely the struggle for the volitional allegiance of powerful decision makers \nwho are often immersed in subjective and disorientating presentational systems. \nThere is then both the possibility of contestation and, consequently, a pressing \nimperative to contest this ground by reaching out to asylum sector \nintermediaries in order to offer alternative presentations of the asylum seekers in \ntheir care. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe author wishes to thank the ESRC for 3+1 studentship support during the \nexecution of this research.
