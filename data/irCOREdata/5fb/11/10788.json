Describes NoWAL's staff training and development programme which includes a general programme, the CILIP Certificate in Library and Information Practice, the CALIM Standard Professional Training programme and a pilot project for senior management. Additionally, NoWAL members engage in exchanging experience, job shadowing and visits. Also recounts how NoWAL secured a contract with OCLC's netlibrary that has led to the acquisition of a collection of up to 12,000 priced and 3,800 free titles - the biggest e-book deal in Europe.<\/dc:description><dc:description>This is an electronic version of an article published in the New Review of Academic Librarianship\u00a9 2004 Copyright Routledge, part of the Taylor & Francis Group; New Review of Academic Librarianship is available online at http:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals\/titles\/13614533.asp<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>Routledge<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2006-06-14T10:40:02Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:format>YES<\/dc:format><dc:identifier>New review of academic librarianship, 2004, vol. 10, no. 2, pp. 119-127<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1361-4533<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>10.1080\/13614530500143711<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/3101<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>1740-7834<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.metapress.com\/media\/mfta2gtytr5yxa768x2m\/contributions\/v\/5\/5\/1\/v5514l1148427297.pdf<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals\/titles\/13614533.asp<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":null,"relations":["http:\/\/www.metapress.com\/media\/mfta2gtytr5yxa768x2m\/contributions\/v\/5\/5\/1\/v5514l1148427297.pdf","http:\/\/www.tandf.co.uk\/journals\/titles\/13614533.asp"],"year":2006,"topics":["Academic libraries","NoWAL","Staff training and development","Librarianship","Professional education","Cooperation","Acquisitions","Electronic books","UK"],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":null}
