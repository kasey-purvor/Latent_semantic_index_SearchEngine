As \na specially tailored mechanism leading to the accession of the Balkans into the \nEuropean Union, the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAp) sets the framework \nfor political and economic transformation of the region. The paper posits that the \nweakness of the EU\u2019s approach derives from the fact that it is informed by the \ndominant transition paradigm, which marginalises the impact of globalisation, and \nspecifically the role of transnational actors. The paper provides a critique of the \n 2 \ntransition literature and its explanatory potential to account for the post-conflict and \npost-Communist transition in the Balkans. It goes on to examine the Balkan \ntransnational space and the role of transnational actors in the process of transition as \nan important additional explanation, while taking into account a double legacy: the \ndomestic legacy, inherited from Communism, on the one hand, and the transnational \nand post-Communist legacy acquired during the conflict, on the other. It advances an \nargument that a weak state offers us a conceptual nexus for the study of democratic \ntransition in the Balkans in the global age. We demonstrate that transnational \nnetworks benefit from a weak state and perpetuate the very weakness that sustains \nthem. At the same time, these networks exploit multiethnicity and stir ethnic tensions, \nlest stabilisation should limit their scope for action. As a result, state- and nation-\nbuilding appear as mutually enfeebling rather than reinforcing, thus subverting the \nexisting EU mechanisms. \n \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe 2004 Eastern enlargement of the European Union (EU), in which Eight post-\nCommunist states became members of the European Union, changed the map of \nEurope profoundly. However, the European future of their counterparts in the Balkans \nis still uncertain, despite the unprecedented push the EU instigated to set the Balkan \npartners on the European path in 2005. It has given the go-ahead to accession \nnegotiations with Croatia and kicked off negotiations on a Stabilisation and \nAssociation Agreement with Serbia and Montenegro; meanwhile, Bosnia and \n 3 \nHerzegovina has advanced internal reforms to be able to follow suit. Does this \ndevelopment lay to rest recent warnings that the Balkans, or, to be precise, Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, Kosovo and the Former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia,1 may  become \u2018an EU enclave\u2019 or a \u2018ghetto\u2019 (Lehne 2004, p. 123; \n\u2018Breaking out of the Balkan ghetto\u2019, 2005)? For a long time, the prospect of EU \nmembership has failed to energise a large swathe of the Balkans to commit to an \neffective and focused reform programme, confounding expectations by policy-makers \nand analysts. The latest engagement in the region has introduced a contractual basis \nfor relations between the EU and the states and entities of the region. However, their \nprofound political, economic and social transformation, dubbed Europeanisation, has \nyet to take place. Crucially, this process will not be determined purely by domestic \nforces, but by transnational ones, too. The effectiveness of the EU\u2019s approach in the \nregion will be determined to the extent that it successfully counters the interplay \nbetween internal and transnational dynamics at play. Only then will the fears of a \n\u2018Balkan ghetto\u2019 be dispersed.    \n \nWe argue that globalisation provides a missing link in an explanation for the troubled \npost-Communist and post-conflict transition in the Balkans. Focusing on the impact of \ntransnational networks as global actors that thrive in the permissive environment of \nweak states in the Balkans, the paper demonstrates that globalisation is internal to the \npost-Communist and post-conflict transition in the region. In sum, globalisation is not \njust a context that moulds the unfolding transitions, but also a force that shapes them \nfrom within. Ultimately, the paper argues that the Europeanisation of the Balkans, \nwhich can be taken as a measure of success of the unfolding political and economic \n 4 \nreforms, has been stalled because the transnational dimension of transition in the \nregion has been underestimated in the European Union\u2019s approach to the Balkans. \n  \nIn this paper, we approach the transition literature as a dominant transition paradigm \ninforming the EU\u2019s approach to the Balkans, and examine it with particular interest in \nterms of its application on the Balkan case. While agreeing with the scholars who \nidentify \u2018stateness\u2019 and the international dimension as areas calling for further \nelaboration in the post-Communist democratisation literature applied to the Balkans, \nwe show that this literature is chiefly characterised by an elaboration and expansion of \nanalysed dimensions rather than by a radical rethink of their manifestation and impact \non transition. The paper then examines the Balkan transnational space and the role of \ntransnational actors in the process of transition. Lastly, it shows that, in a global age, \ntransnational networks can thwart political and economic reform processes, and, \naccordingly, the transformation of a weak post-Communist and post-conflict state into \na strong state, which, in turn, perpetuates the issue of state cohesion. \n \nEuropeanisation of the Balkans: Approaches to Post-Communist Transition  \n \nWith its legacy of Communism and conflict, the European integration of the Western \nBalkans has posed a unique policy challenge to the EU. Transition and stabilisation \nhave been set as two explicit aims for the region\u2019s European integration process.  \nConsequently, the EU has developed a strategic enlargement as well as a security \nconcept for the Balkans, along with the corresponding instruments (Lehne 2004). The \ncornerstone of this policy has been the Stabilisation and Association process (SAp). \nAs a policy instrument, the SAp has been tailored since 1999 to match the double \n 5 \nchallenge of post-Communist and post-conflict transition in the Balkans. It has built \non the accession approach applied to Central and Eastern Europe with a policy of \nenhanced conditionality and regional cooperation. Both of these instruments have \nproved wanting.  \n \nWhat we call \u2018enhanced conditionality\u2019, spanning political, economic and \u2018acquis\u2019-\nrelated requirements of membership, as well as conditions emanating from peace \nagreements and political deals (Anastasakis and Bechev, 2003; Smith, 2003, pp. 113-\n114), has favoured states that have made the greatest progress in reform. This, in turn, \nhas created a new line of division in the region between Balkan candidates and \n\u2018potential candidates\u2019. No policy follow-up was designed to fill the vacuum created \nby the success of the individual aspirants (Papadimitriou 2001). Nor, as van Meurs \npoints out, could tensions and asymmetries thus caused be compensated by regionality \n(van Meurs 2000, p. 22; cf. Demetropoulou 2002).  \n \nIndeed, from the start of the process, the European integration of the Western Balkans \nhas been characterised by the \u2018stability dilemma\u2019, i.e., of those countries that suffer \nfrom the greatest stability deficits not qualifying for EU\u2019s initiatives (Wittkowski \n2000, p. 85). Calic went even further in a critique of the SAp (2003, p. 121). \nAccording to her, accession-oriented instruments are ill-suited to tackling the region\u2019s \nkey problems of state-building, conflict resolution and economic growth. In fact, the \nEU has tackled state-building and conflict resolution in the Western Balkans, but did \nso primarily through the evolving tools of the European Security and Defence Policy \n(ESDP), such as its police and military missions in Bosnia and Herzegovina and \nMacedonia. Scholars have seen the EU\u2019s twin approach to the Western Balkans , \n 6 \nembodied by the SAp and the ESDP mechanisms, as a demonstration of the EU\u2019s \ngrowing strength in projecting stability into the region (Vachudova 2003, p. 157; \nYusufi 2004). By contrast, we argue that it has introduced another level of separation \nof the EU\u2019s policy instruments, often interfering with the SAp\u2014as Serbia and \nMontenegro\u2019s example illustrates powerfully. That country\u2019s European integration \nprocess has been hindered by tensions resulting from the application of the agreement \non state union brokered by the EU as a part of the ESDP. \n \nThe vacuum created by the EU\u2019s approach to the Balkans has crucially benefited a \nparticular group of transnational actors, which has posed a threat to security and has \nspoiled transition efforts, thus undermining the Europeanisation of the Balkan states. \nThe effectiveness of criminal networks thriving on the weakness of the Balkan states \nsprings from the fact that they are \u2018multi-ethnic, cross-border and integrated in \nEurope\u2019 (Anastasijevic 2004). The EU approach, for all its nuances, has not been able \nto match the sources of strength of the spoilers of Europeanisation. Arguably, their \nbiggest strength is the exploitation of the weakness of the state and the new borders in \nthe region, including, importantly, those between successful EU candidates and \naspirants. The EU\u2019s state-building agenda, to the extent that it can be formulated in \nthe variety of instruments that have been used, is ill-equipped to address this complex \nreality on the ground. The EU\u2019s regional approach has been piecemeal at best and, \nessentially, sub-contracted to the Stability Pact, while key initiatives with regional \nimplications, such as local war crimes trials, remain confined within the state borders. \nIn addition, the EU\u2019s engagement in the Western Balkans through the ESDP has had \nan ambiguous effect on advancing European integration precisely because it was not \nintegral to the SAp. \n 7 \n \nThe EU\u2019s policy approach has been framed by a conceptual approach to transition, in \nwhich, as we show, the role of transnational actors in the post-Communist and post-\nwar transition has not received adequate attention. The field of transitology has been \ninformed by the study of transitions from authoritarianism. With its legacy of total \nstate control over politics, economy and society dating from the Communist period, \nthe democratisation of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union raised a question: \nCan the existing scholarship on transition be applied to its post-Communist variant?2 \nThis debate had not yet been resolved when a new challenge was thrown up: A \nstriking divergence in the transitional experience of Central Eastern Europe, on the \none hand, and of the Balkans and the former Soviet Union, on the other, cried out for \nan explanation. Post-Communism as a common denominator of all these states itself \nfailed to provide an answer.  \n \nThe following paragraphs provide a brief overview of approaches to post-Communist \ntransition to democracy in general, and to transition in the Balkans in particular. We \nargue that the troubled transition in the Balkans can be explained by analysing it in \nconjunction with globalisation. Without an agreed definition of globalisation (cf. Held \nand McGrew, 2000), for the purpose of our argument, two aspects of globalization--\nconceived of as a complex process unfolding in politics, economics and culture, are \nparticularly relevant: interconnectedness and transnationalism.3 Interconnectedness is \nclosely related to the erosion of the boundary between the domestic and the external \naspect  of politics in the global age, while intensification of transnational relations \ncreates not only transnational spaces of politics but also transnational networks that \npermeate the domestic political arena (Beck 2000; Kaldor 2003; Giddens 2002). \n 8 \nGlobalisation, which has not been theorised in the transition literature, arguably has a \ndecisive impact on transition in post-Communist countries because transnational \nactors, and the relations they create, encroach on the domestic sphere and become \ninnate to transition. Furthermore, a transnational perspective allows us to explain why \na \u2018stateness\u2019 issue persists in the Balkan case. Linz and Stepan note that there is a \n\u2018stateness\u2019 problem, \u201c[w]hen there are profound differences about the territorial \nboundaries of the political community\u2019s state and profound differences as to who has \nthe right to citizenship in that state\u201d (1996, p. 16). Specifically, we posit that state \nweakness needs to be theorised as a key issue in the transition in the Balkans and as \nan explanation for a persistent question of state legitimacy deriving from a nationalist \nchallenge to the territorial framework of the state.  \n \nVery soon after the demise of Communism, Offe (1991) summarised the complexity \nof the post-Communist transformation succinctly, dubbing it a \u2018triple transition\u2019 that \nencompasses democratic and economic liberalisation coinciding with a quest for the \ncreation of new nation-states. Subsequently, the literature has built around the \napproach focused on the mode of transition, the design of democratic institutions as \nwell as the political elites and participation, and the approach emphasizing the impact \nof the Communist legacy on shaping the political, economic and social transition in \nEastern Europe and former Soviet Union.4 Importantly, these approaches are \ndistinguished by a thrust of their respective arguments rather than by a complete \nexclusion of competing explanations. Common to both has been an awareness of the \ninterconnectedness of multidimensional processes of post-Communist democratic \nconsolidation, including the challenge posed by their simultaneity (Pridham 2001). \n 9 \nNonetheless, three key themes have emerged from this literature: simultaneous \ndemocratisation and marketisation; \u2018stateness\u2019; and the international dimension.  \n \nPost-Communist democratisation literature on the Balkans built on the East and \nCentral European literature in two directions. A comprehensive analysis of \ndemocratisation in the Balkans, in an edited volume by Pridham and Gallagher, \nhighlighted the impact of the historical legacy alongside the simultaneity of three \ntypes of transformation: political, economic and that linked to nation-building \n(Pridham and Gallagher 2000). This dimension encompasses both the pre-Communist \nand Communist legacy. As the authors demonstrate, it impacts on the transition \nthrough various forms: political culture, civil society (and a lack of it), political \nleadership, prior democratic experience, etc. To capture diverse transitional paths in \nthe Balkans, Pridham advocates an interactive approach with a \u2018dynamic potential that \nis particularly attractive as it allows us to bring into play such determinants as the \nhistorical and how legacies from the past impact on the present as well as the \ninterplay between top-down dictates and bottom-up pressure\u2019 (2000, p. 6; Cf. Vu\u010deti\u0107 \n2004).  \n \nThe other line along which post-Communist democratisation literature has been \nadapted to account for the Balkan \u2018anomaly\u2019 problematises the \u2018stateness\u2019 dimension \n(cf. Szabo 1994; Sekelj 2001). Kopeck\u00fd and Mudde (2000) called for a better \nunderstanding of the distinct processes of state and nation-building and of the \ninternational dimension, encompassing  both the context and the actors, and their role \nin post-Communist democratisation. Echoing Offe\u2019s approach, Kuzio (2001) \nproposed a \u2018quadruple transition,\u2019 advocating a separate analysis of \u2018stateness\u2019, \n 10 \ninterpreted as state-institution building, and nationness, in terms of civic nation-\nbuilding. Indeed, the stability of a state\u2019s political and territorial framework, whether \ntheorised in terms of Linz and Stepan\u2019s \u2018stateness\u2019 or in terms of state-destroying \nethnic nationalism (Parrott 1997), is one of the key distinguishing features of post-\nCommunist democratisation. Still, the unanswered question in the Balkan case is: why \ndoes the issue of \u2018stateness\u2019, national cohesion and state weakness persist? Are they \nrelated and how? Does multiethnicity a priori thwart the prospects of democratic \nconsolidation (cf. Roeder 1999)?  \n \nThe focus on the pre-Communist and Communist legacy singles out a set of \ndimensions that prominently figure in Balkan democratisation. Even though it was \nbumpy, Romania\u2019s and Bulgaria\u2019s road towards European integration provides a \nsobering view on the constraining impact of these legacies. However, it also brings to \nthe fore the impact of war in the Balkans as a post-Communist legacy on post-\nCommunist democratisation. Arguably, the wars in the 1990s shaped both the pre-\nCommunist and Communist legacy in politics, economics and society in the Balkans. \nEnumerating war-related difficulties of transition in the Western Balkans, Batt singled \nout: the destruction of social capital; distorted economic liberalisation; state weakness \ncaused by the growth of military and security forces and corruption; social \ntransformation as a result of forced migration; and a lack of trust in the political elites \n(2004, pp. 18-19). Pippidi highlights a destructive impact that informal networks in \nstatus-based societies can have on social trust as the essence of social capital (2005; In \nSearch of Responsive Government, 2003). While the legacy of war provides an \nimportant analytical avenue, we argue that its explanatory power is undermined by \n 11 \nexcluding a global dimension of the legacy of the war and its impact on democratic \ntransition and, consequently, on the European integration of the Balkans.  \n \nThe international aspect of democratisation has been criticised as an underestimated \nand undertheorised aspect of transition to democracy (cf. Wiarda 2000). The literature \nhere subsequently took up the transnational aspect of post-Communist \ndemocratisation. Schmitter\u2019s observation on the actors in the promotion of democracy \nhas been particularly relevant for the post-Communist experience. Referring to \ninternational organisations, human rights groups, foundations, the media, \ntransnational firms, dissidents, etc., he pointed out that \u2018this world beneath and \nbeyond the nation-state has played an especially significant role in the international \npromotion of democracy\u2019 (Schmitter 1996, p. 29). It is this complexity of \u2018external\u2019 \nactors on the democratic consolidation that the contributions in Pravda and Zielonka\u2019s \n(2001) edited volume sought to illuminate (cf. Brown 2000; Lewis 1997; Cichock \n2002). The literature on the international and transnational dimension of post-\nCommunist transition and democratisation has sought to explain the moulding of \ndomestic processes under the impact of external actors and contexts. Crucially, this \nliterature maintains the distinction between the domestic and the external, albeit \nsomewhat mitigated by the impact of the external on the domestic (Cf. Pravda 2001, \np. 6; Pridham, Herring and Sanford 1994). We contribute to the analytical effort by \nchanging the  perspective on the internal and the external elements  of politics. We \nrelate the post-Communist democratisation in the Balkans to globalisation, a process \nthat erases the distinction between the internal and the external.  \n \n 12 \nWe demonstrate in this paper that \u2018stateness\u2019\u2014conceptualised both in terms of nation- \nand institution-building and in a dialectic relationship between the two\u2014continues to \nplague democratisation efforts in the Balkans because of the impact of transnational \nnetworks. They are both internal and external in the context of globalisation. These \nnetworks are a product of \u2018new wars\u2019, which, as Kaldor (2001) argues, are \ninextricably linked to globalisation, and owe their resilience in the post-war phase to a \ncombination of a weak state and integration into global transnational networks. Their \nrelation with a multi-ethnic nature of their local environment is ambivalent. While \nthey depend on the collaboration with members of other ethnicities, they are apt to stir \nethnic tensions lest stabilisation should favour the imposition of the rule of law and \ntheir sanctioning. In sum, inter-ethnic collaboration is necessary to sustain their \nactivity, but stirring ethnic tensions creates an environment in which they project \nthemselves as a guarantor of their own ethnic group\u2019s security. Ultimately, the issue \nof \u2018stateness\u2019 presents itself as an impossibility of ethnic groups to achieve a \nconsensus on the state and nation, when its root cause should be actually sought in the \nmode of the operation of transnational networks.  \n \nEthnic Networks and Weak State: The Transnational Context and Transition in \nthe Balkans \n \nA weak state in the Balkans is a key to understanding the operation of the \ntransnational networks through a deleterious linkage between political and economic \ninterests. We therefore argue that it is not so much the simultaneity of democratisation \nand marketisation, but rather their conflation and exploitation by the political elites in \nthe Balkans, that are obstacles to the transitional efforts. Without the rule of law all \n 13 \neconomic acts are political. This dimension cannot be understood without an \nelaboration of economic informality in the Balkans. In this paper we draw on \nKrastev\u2019s (2002) conceptualisation of a weak state in the Balkans. According to him, \nthe Balkan state is weak in four different ways. The first refers to Migdal\u2019s (1988) \ntheory, conceiving of state weakness as the inability  of governments to implement \ntheir policy visions, penetrate society, to regulate, etc. The second refers to citizens\u2019 \nview of a state. Specifically, a state may be able to collect taxes and be strong in that \nrespect, but unable to deliver the rule of law or protect human and property rights. \nThe third approach defines a weak state as being captured by particular political \ninterests that dominate policy. And the fourth stems from the strategic behaviour of \nelites involved in a predatory project that extracts resources from the state. By \nimplication, in post-Communist Balkan states, while there have been elections and a \nchange of elites, there has also been preparedness to strip the state bare. The state \nweakness in the Balkans has had a decisive impact on democratisation in the region. \nHowever, there have been no attempts to integrate this within the transitional \nframework of Balkan transition, despite its recognition as a problem (Cf. Mu\u00e7o 2001; \nSotiropoulos 2001).  \n \nWhile critiquing the analysis of state weakness in isolation from globalisation in the \ntransition literature, we benefit from the literature on post-Communist \ndemocratisation, which underlines the importance of the pre-Communist and \nCommunist legacy. Importantly, we relate it to the war legacy as well. Examining the \nimpact of transnational actors in the context of a weak state, we explain the \nperpetuation of particularist nationalist politics while placing the transition paradigm \ninto a broader environment of globalisation. We now turn to the Balkan transnational \n 14 \nspace and look at how it has been re-configured more recently as a result of local-\nglobal dynamics, and, in that context, at the implications of the rise to prominence of \na particular group of transnational actors on the region\u2019s transition trajectory. \n \nThe Legacy of a Common State \n \nThe break-up of the common economic and political space through the dissolution of \nformer Yugoslavia, once the largest country in the Balkans, has added a specific twist \nto the transnational context against which the newly created countries set out to \nimplement transition reforms. Having transformed themselves from federal units of a \nsingle state into independent political entities, former Yugoslavia\u2019s successor states \nhave found it difficult to extricate their economic, social and political being from the \nexperience of belonging to a common state. The geo-political re-configuration of the \nBalkan space has fundamentally transformed the nature and patterns of interaction of \nstate- and non-state actors alike. The very notion of what is external and\/or \ninternational in the national governance framework has become somewhat ambivalent \nin this context, bearing a specific weight in the structuring of Balkan transnational \nrelations.  \n \nDespite the high degree of decentralisation of former Yugoslavia\u2019s particular model \nof socialism, decades of development under the unifying ideology of the communist \nstate and its centrally planned economy created a basic set of country-wide economic \nand political institutions, and a web of dense and diverse links among its various \ncommunities, peoples and institutions. The existence of the common state allowed for \nunhindered flows of people, capital and information as the foundations of the single \n 15 \neconomic space, in which a country-wide specialisation was nurtured through the \nsystem of central planning. This political system gave former Yugoslavia\u2019s \nconstituent people an equal status, extending the same political, cultural and economic \nrights irrespective of where the administrative borders of former Yugoslavia\u2019s \nrepublics cut across these communities. The creation of the five independent states on \nthe territory of former Yugoslavia, and the imposition of state borders, brought this \nmodel to an end. Production chains were cut and enterprises split by these new \nborders; commercial links were severed and the very nature of commercial \ntransactions were altered through the disappearance of a common currency; new \nminorities were created, becoming the de novo states\u2019 diaspora communities.  In this \nchanged context, the legacy of a common state, by way of once intense and diverse \nlinks, familiarity with institutions, common culture, language similarities and spatial \nproximity proved a facilitating factor for all sorts of transactions, often motivated by \nmore or less similar concerns shared by the population. But by far the most buoyant \nwere transactions based around exploiting the differences between newly bordered \npolitical entities and their relations as independent states with the third parties (eg. the \nEuropean Union). The greater the attempts to control these borders, the greater the \nincentive to create informal transactions.The tightening of the European Union\u2019s \nimmigration policy had the same effect5. In the economic domain these transactions   \nas a rule have tended to evolve along informal and\/or illicit trade, since formal cross- \nborder activities have been constrained by the combined effects of the economic \nimpact of transition, subsequent wars and hostile politics between the new neighbors. \nWith regards to the former, output contraction, similarity of production structures and \nEuropean trade incentives resulted in modest economic cooperation across the new \nborders; indeed, in their changed economic outlook, the newly established countries \n 16 \nappeared more like competitors. Ethnic politics imposed additional constraints to the \nmore vigorous development of formal economic exchange and acted as a potent \nrestraining factor in cross-border interaction in other fields.  \n \nThe legacy of a common state has been reflected in the actual implementation of the \ntransition policies. For example, with the disappearance of a common state, the issue \nof explicitly domestic governance, such as privatisation, becomes internationalised. \nAssets which are the subject of privatisation as well as the key actors of privatisation \nare now separated by the borders of several states and state- like entities, which  \nmakes the implementation of this key transition policy reform more intricate than in \nother countries and undermines its standing as domestic policy in its own right. \nSimilarly, the implementation of human rights provisions as part of a democracy-\nbuilding agenda has acquired international clout because of the way in which the \nvarious policy concerns have been affected by the creation of new borders. The very \ndisappearance of a common state triggered substantial migration flows, which \nescalated further with the onset of wars of the 1990s. For their host states, dealing \nwith the claims of these new migrants has required complex inter-state procedures in \nresponse to the specific concerns of their status and rights created by the \ndisintegration of former Yugoslavia. \n \nThese two examples highlight the unique significance that the legacies of belonging to \na common state have in shaping the Balkan countries\u2019 transformation trajectories in \ntheir transnational context. They point to the importance of understanding the \ndevelopments in the Balkans\u2019 political, economic and social spheres in their \nidiosyncratic regional context where a common history, culture and physical \n 17 \nproximity mean continued diverse and complex links across newly created borders, \nescaping the logic of nation-bound policies informing approaches to Balkan \ntransition. The legacies of belonging to a common state not only affect the linkages \namong various actors both at the state and sub-state level within former Yugoslavia\u2019s \nspace, but also impact on a definition of the terms and dynamics of the Balkan \ncountries\u2019 broader transnational relations, including, most concretely, EU and NATO \nmembership, co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former \nYugoslavia and various other international agencies. \n \nThe Legacy of War and its Political Economy \n \nThe involvements of a large array of external actors in the \u201cwars of Yugoslav \nsuccession\u201d- a common term denoting a series of conflicts on the territory of former \nYugoslavia - can be traced at every stage of these conflicts. It ranged from the \nengagement by the major powers, neighbouring states, international governmental and \nnon-governmental organisations, international business to diasporas and organised \ncrime and terrorist networks. The modalities and intensity of this engagement differed \namong the individual actors; their mutual relations, too, mutated and transformed with \nthe ebbs and flows of the conflict. But in the process, they played a defining role in \nre-positioning the Balkans in the global setting through the particular way in which \nthey were integrated (\u201cdomesticated\u201d) into the logic and mode of operation of local \npolitico-economic and social structures. \n \nThe political dynamics created through the war had a distinctly transnational \ndimension; sustaining the war momentum required participation of actors at different \n 18 \nterritorial levels linked in the complex patterns of interaction. Looking from a purely \ninternal  and resource-focused perspective, given the restricted financial and combat \nresources of the warring parties, some of whom, moreover, were constrained by an \ninternational arms embargo, the outbreak of the conflict and its conduct was possible \nonly because of its outward opening. Thus arms, and other combat and everyday \ngoods, foreign fighters and money came from across the borders, providing vital input \nfor waging the war. Humanitarian aid poured in to aid the victims of violence, and an \ninternational civilian and military presence intensified as the conflicts subsided. \nGoods came into the conflict zone only partially using formal channels, often \ntravelling along peace-time smuggling routes and pathways that had been adapted to \nthe war fighting needs. Flows of money followed a similar pattern. Often, money was \ncarried in the personal luggage of individuals acting in various official and non-\nofficial capacities, or found its way to its recipients through real and fictitious \nentities.6 Another factor contributing to the thickening web of cross-border \ninteractions that developed under the cover of the war were international sanctions \nagainst Serbia and Montenegro for its involvement in the wars in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina and Croatia. Sanction-busting, which provided a lifeline to the regime in \nBelgrade, brought together a whole gamut of transnational actors who engaged in the \nvery lucrative, yet clandestine, trade in all sorts of legal goods, especially those \ncarrying a high tariff premium, e,g. fuel, cigarettes and alcohol, aided and sponsored \nby the regime. \n \nThe growth of informal transaction in the Balkans, which will become the most \ncomplex issue of its post-conflict transformation, was not just a side effect of war, as \nseems to be largely the case in classic inter-state wars. In fact, the character of the \n 19 \nviolence itself, which had its roots in the disintegration of the state structures, defined \nthe economic mode on which it was sustained. The failure of the state to provide for \nthe public opened the space for alternative supply networks. The weak taxation basis \nof the formal local economy prompted a search for alternative sources of economic \npower secured through informal economic practices. For the most part, this involved \nthe clandestine trade of initially mainly legal goods, but, increasingly, also illegal \nones. It also included the appropriation (\u2018taxation\u2019) of humanitarian assistance, as well \nas various other more or less sophisticated schemes outside conventional production \nand exchange. An important source of funding was secured through diaspora \nnetworks, some of which were directly linked to criminal rings (e.g. Albanian \ndiasporas\u2019 funding of the Kosovo Liberation Army). Recourse to informality was a \ncommon occurrence during Communist times, which made the foundation for the new \nsystem that much easier. What changed was the nature of informality, in that the \noutright criminal enterprise became its substantial part and transformed into a \nphenomenon whereby it no longer became possible to delimit formal from informal \neconomic space.7 The importance of this mutation is partly to do with the size, i.e. the \nexpanding zone of criminal economy. The other, equally sinister, aspect is the way in \nwhich state structures became engaged in criminal activities, either by direct \ninvolvement or through their complicit behaviour,8 and the long-term damaging \nimpact this has had on building legitimate institutions of governance on which the EU \napproach to stabilisation of the region rests. \n \nThe informal enterprise, which formed the core of the Balkan war economy, was \nfuelled and sustained through multiple links integrating into global chains of informal \ntrans-border trade, of which criminal trade is a part.9 It provided a source of living for \n 20 \nlarge numbers of ordinary people struggling to survive war-inflicted destitution, and a \nsource of profit for those within politico-military structures or with privileged access \nto them. The main figures of this emerging non-regulated economic space, who grew \nto wage important political influence, were people close to the politico-military \nestablishment, regardless of whether they were individuals with a criminal past, \nmembers of diasporas, or conventional tradesman. Often they were bound together by \nthe bonds of ethnicity, kinship or political affiliation. Goods looted locally, which \nfrequently belonged to opposing ethnic group, were shipped to foreign markets \nthrough networks of agents operating transnationally (like the footloose agents, this \ntype of transaction is, by its very nature, non-territorial). They crossed paths with \ngoods stolen worldwide, with narcotics, with people and other commodities \ncirculating within global clandestine trade rings in which the Balkans\u2019 role grew as \nthe prospect of stability remained distant.10 Part of the proceeds from the sales were \nplugged back into fighting the war. The Balkans\u2019 war economy provided an economic \npower base for the state and state-like entities engaged in violence. It was through \nvarious forms of clandestine activity,11 in which ethnic elites colluded and actively \ninteracted across borders and linked into global informal trade flows, that the new \npolitical regimes could be sustained. The close links between political, military, \nsecurity and criminal elites, linked into networks operating across borders, represent \nthe most challenging legacy of war and its political economy, influencing the process \nof transition in the Balkans12 and something to which the EU approach so far has \nfailed to provide an adequate response.  \n \nThe Impact of Liberal Economic Reforms \n \n 21 \nEconomic liberalisation, as a potent channel through which the forces of globalisation \nwork, is another important force shaping the transnational context of the Balkan \ntransition through pressures on the countries to implement liberal economic reforms \nas part of the post-Communist transition. At their core, the externally assisted \ntransition programmes have an economic reform package based around neo-liberal \neconomic precepts of deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation as the key for the \nestablishment of market based economy. Indeed, the creation of the market economy \nbased on a neo-liberal restructuring agenda is the essence of the SAp itself (and EU \naccession process in general) and a point of reference for defining conditionality \ncriteria. The reforms are aimed at eliminating the interference of the state in the \neconomic domain and transforming its role into that of a regulator of the market-\nbased economic regime. Liberal economic reforms also presuppose a particular model \nof development in which exports and foreign investment are viewed as crucial for \nimproving competitiveness. Exposed to this particular paradigm, Balkan countries are \npressed to privatise state-owned assets, deregulate their markets and remove barriers \nto trade. To the degree that the reforms are implemented, they are supposed to provide \nthe Balkans with the benefits of access to capital, technology and markets, and \npresumably provide an opportunity for a different pattern of integration into a world \neconomy than the one characteristic of the pre-transition phase. This essentially \nmeans that the territorial outreach within which economic development takes place \nhas broadened, and that the role of the factors on which it depends has been re-\ndefined, accentuating the importance of non-national, non-state arena for their \nutilisation. With a view to actors, this transformation opens the possibility for a \nprofound encroachment of international commercial and financial capital onto the \nBalkans\u2019 domestic economic sphere - a tendency underpinning the overall logic of \n 22 \nneo-liberal globalisation. The manner in which the process of reforms is guided\u2014\nthrough the involvement of a complex set of inter-linked institution such as the \ninternational financial institutions and the European Union\u2014makes it impossible to \nconsider it solely a matter of domestic policy. \n \nThe economic and political setting against which economic reforms have been \npursued in the Balkans is a complex one, in which the legacy of underdevelopment \nand over-sized industry is compounded by war-induced disruption and political \ninstability. It is the region that has historically lagged behind the developed part of \nEurope that constitutes the core of the European Union.13 The Balkans\u2019 insertion into \nthe world economy in the pre-transition period was based on a narrow export \ncapacity, mainly in semi-processing and extractive industries, which were particularly \nhard-hit in the process of transition. The sheer scale of restructuring required to turn \nthe economy towards one in which exports will provide the key engine of growth is \nmonumental for poor countries\u2014such as most of the Balkans. In trying to (re)capture \nexternal markets, they have faced strong competition, finding it difficult to achieve \nand maintain a competitive edge. The fiscal and monetary austerity required by the \nreforms has constrained the state\u2019s capacity to provide public services, resulting in the \nreduction of breadth of public services and a decline in quality.  Another particularly \nimportant aspect of the Balkan transition has been the scale and persistence of \nunemployment in the aftermath of the years of conflict in the region and restricted job \nopportunities.  This has made it even more problematic for neo-liberal reforms to \ndeliver professed benefits of these reforms. Rather, a sharp increase in poverty and \ninequality has been one of the distinct features of transition in this region, which, in \nthe post-conflict environment, becomes even more disconcerting for both economic as \n 23 \nwell as political repercussions. The extent of penetration of foreign capital in the \nBalkans has been limited; in terms of the scale of foreign investment, the Balkans \nhave attracted a significantly smaller inflow of foreign investment than the Central \nEuropean transition economies. Rather than through greenfield investment in \nproductive capacity, foreign capital has come mainly through privatisation, especially \nin the banking sector. The concentration of foreign ownership in the more lucrative \nsegments of the economy increases the political influence of transnational capital, \nwhile defining the pattern of economic transformation and therefore the position of \nthe Balkans in the world economy. Thus far, the limited inflow of new strategic \ninvestment has constrained corporate restructuring and most Balkan countries have \nfailed to significantly improve their competitive position as a mark of strengthened \neconomic stance. \n \nTo carry out the complex agenda that neo-liberal economic restructuring entails \nrequires a state capacity\u2014in terms of institutions, resources and political \ncommitment\u2014that, as the analysis in the first part of this paper highlighted, most \nBalkan states lack. Economic liberalisation, against the background of a war economy \nand weak state, had an unintended effect of perpetuating and nurturing the type of \ntransnational links that have not contributed to stabilising the region through greater \ncooperation.   \n \nTransnational Actors  \n \nThe above three instances, each representing a channel through which globalisation \nhas had a distinct influence on Balkan contemporary development, combine to create \n 24 \na context within which powerful groups of transnational actors who shaped the course \nof transition have nestled. The multiplication of borders, migrations, including forced \npopulation displacement, the war economy and the perverse impact of neo-liberal \nadjustment provided a fertile ground on which these actors were able to expand their \nactivities.14 It is a context marked by economic underdevelopment, ethno-criminal \npolitics and inadequate local capacity to forge ahead with the process of \nmodernisation that the EU agenda has implicitly come to signify.  \n \nWhilst none of the actors is new or unique to the Balkans, it is important to point out \nthat re-shaping their identities, motives and, consequently, the nature of the impact of \ntheir agency can only be grasped with reference to this context. For example, \ndiasporas as a transnational actor by definition (Ostergaard-Nielsen, 2001, p. 218) in \nthis context becomes actively involved in local politics not only through its traditional \nchannels of influence such as political lobbying, donations and remittances (all of \nwhich were amply used in the Balkans), but also by participating directly in the \nmatters of internal governance. The case in point is the parliamentary representation \nof diasporas in Croatia. This in turn fundamentally re-defines the parameters within \nwhich diasporas operate, making them a potent force that can influence political \noutcomes in the domestic arena from within the borders of a home state.15 The \npractice of members of diasporas taking on government office has been widespread in \nthe region, compared with isolated cases in other transition countries. During the \nconflicts, diasporas provided funding, manpower, connections to international \npolitical and military circles, and logistics support for waging the war. Diaspora \nfunding has been an important source for sustaining local economies and shoring up \ngovernment budgets. This latter aspect was particularly important during the conflicts, \n 25 \nwith implications about their dynamics as well as political re-grouping against which \nthe conflict settlement had to be devised. For example, in the case of quasi-state \nauthorities such as the Bosnian Croat para-state of Herzeg-Bosnia, diaspora funding \nplayed a pivotal role in establishing parallel structures of government16 that proved \nthe key obstacle in implementing the peace agreement. Similar problems were \nencountered in Kosovo and, in less institutionalised form, within Bosnian Serb and \nBosnian Muslim structures, as well as in Serbia and Macedonia.  While undoubtedly \neasing the life of ordinary people, the impact of these funds, often channelled through \npolitical party structures, can be quite different in terms of a government\u2019s credibility \nin fulfilling its role. This type of support attenuates the constraints a weak economy \nposes on the fiscal basis of the state, and modifies the basis of the contract between \nthe government and the public. Being an alternative source of funding, it can make the \ngovernment less susceptible to external pressures to pursue the reform aimed at \nimproving fiscal position.17 Of course, not all modes of diaspora engagement can be \nviewed solely in terms of feeding into conflict dynamics; there are examples of \npositive and constructive diaspora engagement in the Balkans. The point is, rather, \nthat the many varied ways in which the diaspora has been engaged in the Balkans \nprovides an important part of the explanation for the tenacity of ethno-national \nstructures, as diasporas generally follow the lines of ethnic affiliation.  \n \nThe plurality of actors, and the diversity and variety of trans-border activities, makes \nit difficult to consider any of them in isolation. So, for example, diasporas are often \nclosely associated with organised crime;18  transnational non-governmental \norganisations are sometimes linked to international financial agencies; terrorist \norganisations often secure some of the funding through organised crime and are \n 26 \nsometimes linked with seemingly benevolent non-governmental organisations, and so \non. Instead, it is more appropriate to conceive of transnational actors operating as a \ncomplex system of overlapping networks, which work in concert with (and through) \nlocal structures. Giving this system functional integrity is the mode in which these \nnetworks have been accommodated within the local structures, providing the vital \nresource for the sustenance of a particular type of political authority that has emerged \nin the Balkans under the impact of post-totalitarian transition, conflict and \nglobalisation.  \n \nGoing back to the key question of the causes of state weakness in the Balkans \naddressed earlier, in this way, one can get a better insight into the role organised \ncrime and terrorist networks, as a particularly ominous and dangerous transnational \nphenomenon, have come to play in the local social dynamics. It can also provide a \nmore accurate19 understanding of how, through these networks, the initiatives aimed \nat strengthening formal structures of governance are captured and subverted, making \nthese structures empty shells that ultimately cannot perform the tasks required by the \nEU accession agenda.  \n \nDuffield (2001) talks about forms of authority that do not require, or indeed imply, \nterritorial control, and Jung (2003) refers to it as a concurrence of shadow state and \nshadow economy. The essence in which this form of political authority differs from a \nconventional notion of (functioning) state is that real power resides in the informal \nstructures that are built around (and through) the formal institutions of the state, and \nthat do not have their economic power base in regular economic activity. This type of \npolitical authority can only be sustained in the transnational and global context. The \n 27 \ngrowing literature on new wars views the emergence of this type of political authority \nclosely following the dynamics of globalisation, even referring to it as \u201cshadow \nglobalisation\u201d (Jung, 2003) because of the importance that informal and criminal \nstructures play in sustaining it. This type of political authority has no interest in \nstrengthening state institutions and forging regional co-operation, both of which are \ninstrumental for the success of the EU strategy towards the Balkans. \n \nOrganised crime is, by its nature, transnational in its outlook and has been fuelled by \nthe ease of communications and opportunities that the process of globalisation has \nopened. The nature of activity makes the zones of instability, in which legal and \npolitical order is weak, its natural habitat.20  In that sense, the Balkans has been a \nstrong pole of attraction for organised crime. However, its development into a \nrelevant force decisively influencing economic and political dynamics in the Balkans \nis intricately related to the establishment of the new forms of political authority \nfollowing the collapse of Yugoslavia and the region\u2019s subsequent difficult transition. \nIt is not just a case of organised crime groups, or, for that matter, diasporas, \nprotruding into Balkan political, social and economic space. These groups found \neager interlocutors in the new political elite in search of alternative sources of \npolitical and economic power, and using ethnic violence as an instrument. The extent \nof participation of state structures and\/or its collusion with organised crime, which has \nits roots in their near symbiosis during the conflicts, is the element that constitutes a \nparticularly sinister aspect of the impact of organised crime on transition in the \nBalkans. 21  This is why the discourse on organised crime in the Balkans, which views \nit as the extreme form of informal activity, separate  from the conventional economy \nand outside the particular political context, belies the true nature of its impact.  \n 28 \nA complex relationship developed between local political elites, and local and \nregional organised crime networks hooked to global criminal flows. The existence of \nmany porous borders, and borders controlled by different ethnic groups, provided a \nstrong incentive for illicit activities, in which inter-ethnic cooperation was common. \nThus an informal mode of regional co-operation developed in the Balkans. The strong \npresence of local criminal groups closely linked to political structures controlling \nparts of the territory provided unimpeded access to global criminal networks. The \nmerging of criminal and political structures is perhaps best illustrated in the figure of \n\u017deljko Ra\u017enjatovi\u0107 Arkan\u2014a convicted criminal and warlord turned politician and \nmember of the Serbian government. \n \nThe links of war follow into peace, as Nordstrom (2004) has persuasively argued. \nActive participation of state structures in criminal activities, blurring the line between \nwhat is formal and informal, has made rule-breaking a norm in conducting economic \nand political affairs in the Balkans, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the state. \nThis explains why informal activity continues to flourish. Organised crime activities \nin the Balkans, in their most extreme form, have intensified compared to late 1980s \nand shifted their focus to more traditional forms, such as drug and human trafficking. \nMany local underworld figures have become important players in the transnational \norganised crime rings, their links to the political establishment providing them with a \ndegree of immunity and the possibility to channel some of their proceeds into legal \nbusinesses.22  \n \nIn this context, economic transition reforms have sometimes had an unintended effect. \nLiberalisation against the backdrop of the state-controlled economy unleashed a fierce \n 29 \nscramble for remaining resources, which were mainly concentrated in the public \ndomain. Thus control of the state, through the tenure of public office, became a target \nof political struggle. Control was secured through informal networks, often based on \nethnicity or other ascriptive principles. In the Balkans, therefore, privatisation has \noften been captured by network interests, securing privileged access to those closely \nconnected to the political elites. In many instances, insider privatisation has been a \npreferred method, enabling the political elites to turn their position into economic \nmight. Instances of money, originating in illicit activities, being laundered through \nprivatisation are common. Similarly, trade liberalisation has provided another avenue \nthat have been utilised by the informal power structures to benefit disproportionately \nby breaking the rules in favour of groups associated with local authorities. Thus, the \ntwo key economic reforms aimed at establishing the market economy have been \nmisused by power structures linked to organised crime for their own personal \nenrichment and as a way of propping up their own power base\u2014often defined along \nethnic lines. This largely explains why these structures have no interest in \nstrengthening the rule of law and other formal state institutions. These structures, \nwhich developed in the course of the region\u2019s adaptation to the challenges and \nopportunities posed by globalisation, present the most formidable obstacle to a \nconsolidation of reforms and to the transformation of these societies into stable \ndemocracies and prosperous economies. \n \nConclusion:  \n \nProgress in the Europeanisation of the Western Balkans has been disproportionately \nslow and uncertain, especially when gauged against the efforts, policies and \n 30 \nincentives the European Union has offered the region since the Kosovo war in 1999. \nYet, despite EU\u2019s substantial involvement and impact on democratisation in the \nregion, both of the EU\u2019s incentives to the Western Balkans\u2014through  enlargement \nand ESDP instruments\u2014seem to have actually undercut its ability to project stability \nin the region. There is some doubt over the EU\u2019s commitment to full future \nmembership for the Balkan states. Moreover,  EU\u2019s instruments and structures have \noften been mutually enfeebling rather than reinforcing.  \n \nSpecifically, our criticism of the EU\u2019s approach to the Western Balkans concerns the \nlack of transnational dimension in dealing with the region and, more importantly, with \nthe successful advance of some states over others. The creation of insiders and \noutsiders in the \u2018EU club\u2019 of member states has led to the creation of new borders in \nthe Balkans. These borders delineate areas of a weak rule of law that are swiftly \nexploited by transnational networks. Rather than strengthening the state to enable it to \nengage in the Europeanisation process, these networks subvert the assistance for \ninclusion into the EU to advance their own agendas and interests. This explains why \nformal regional cooperation championed by the EU is only marginal and superficial. \nSimply put, the EU has not managed to tackle the source of strength of the region\u2019s \nshady transnational networks by countering their transnationalism with a \ntransnationalism of its own. The EU\u2019s policy ought to be of the same transnational \nnature as the activities of the very networks that undermine the European project in \nthe region.  \n \nThe weak state in the Balkans provides a conceptual nexus for the study of democratic \ntransition in the global age. The separation between the notions of state- and nation-\n 31 \nbuilding in the literature on democratisation of the Balkans is important. However, it \ndoes not explain why the issue of \u2018stateness\u2019 persists. We have argued that \u2018troubled\u2019 \ntransitional paths in the Balkans ought to be viewed through the prism of \nglobalisation. The informal and criminal networks affect the transformation of these \nstates from within. Furthermore, the transnational networks operating as global actors \neffectively demonstrate the \u2018internalisation\u2019 of globalisation. It is this dimension of \ntransition that has been neglected in the transition literature. To the extent that the \nimpact of global forces has been acknowledged, it has been consigned to an impact of \nexternal forces on the domestic processes. We have argued that the transnational \nnetworks are a manifestation of globalisation becoming internal to transition, shaping \nit from inside.   \n \nSuch a reinterpretation of transition in the Balkans also requires a critical look at the \nnotion of the legacy shaping democratisation. By focusing on transnational networks, \nwe highlight the relevance of domestic and inherited legacy from Communism, and \ntransnational and acquired legacy mainly through war after Communism. The Balkan \ntransitions cannot be understood without understanding the region\u2019s double legacy\u2014\nas well as the interaction between these two legacies. Both these legacies affect state- \nand nation-building. On the one hand, thwarted efforts at state-building undermine \nnation-building. On the other, exclusive national interests interfere with the state-\nbuilding project. They are mutually formative through the activities of networks and \nthe involvement of state structures in these networks. In sum, networks benefit from a \nweak state and perpetuate the very weakness that sustains them. \n  \n \n 32 \nThe impact of transnational networks prevents the creation of a modern state \n\u2018independent of the ruler and the ruled\u2019, and manipulates multiethnicity into exclusive \npolitics of fear rather than liberal multiculturalism, ultimately keeping a European \nfuture at bay.  Key to this is the involvement of the state structures in the informal \neconomy, which itself feeds on illicit transnational flows. Informal and formal are as \nindistinguishable as economic and political. Thus the state breaks the rules it is \nsupposed to set and enforce. As a result, the state\u2019s legitimacy is compromised and the \nbase for building a functioning state eroded. The EU\u2019s approach, defined by state \nboundaries and centred on formal political and economic institutions, while not \nrecognising their informal side, leaves room for transnational actors to slip through \nthe policy net. As a result, EU engagement in assisting post-Communist, post-conflict \nstate building in the Balkans in a global context can have the opposite effect of \nrekindling the process of fragmentation innate to state-building through ethnic \nviolence. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nEarlier drafts of this paper were presented at  \n \n \nReferences: \n \n 33 \nAnastasakis, O. and D.

Schmitter in the Slavic Review (Bunce 1995a; Karl & Schmitter \n1995; Bunce 1995b; cf. Bova, 1991; Fish, 1999; Pridham, 1994; Nodia, 1996; Munck, \n1997). \n3 While regular interactions across national boundaries comprise the essence of \ntransnational relations, we conceptualise transnationalism broadly so as to encompass \ntrans-societal and trans-governmental relations (Risse-Kappen, 1995). \n4 Compare Linz & Stepan (1996) and Huntington (1991) with Stark & Bruszt (1998); \nBunce (1999); Fish (1998); Verdery (1996). \n5 The geography of the region positioned on the crossroads between developed \nEurope and destitute zones to the far East, and the upheaval caused by the war and \nsanctions, were important contributing factors to explain the illicit flows of people \nand goods. \n6 Often these were non-governmental organisations, with a broader agenda than \nofficially professed, or legally established foreign offices of local states, e.g. some of \nthe embassies of Bosnia and Herzegovina were used for illicit transfers of money \ndestined towards funding the war.   \n7 Saphir (2000) defines this process as \u201ceconomic criminalisation\u201d.  \n8 All types of state structures directly or indirectly became a part of this \u201ccriminal \nenterprise\u201d: security forces, customs officers, bureaucrats, high-ranking politicians \nand members of government. \n9 Balkan transition has been characterised by sharp and prolonged output decline, so \nthat trade rather than production became the main economic activity. Chavdarova \n 45 \n                                                                                                                                            \n(2001) describes how the shift from work to transactions is conducive to the  spread \nof informal economic practice.  \n10 Commenting on the importance of understanding the transnational context in which \ncontemporary wars take place, Nordstrom (2004, p. 150) makes a point that there are \nmany actors implicated in the \u201cfortunes of political instability\u201d. \n11 P. Andreas (2004) identifies clandestine trade as an arena of ethnic cooperation and \nconflict. \n12 These links were not entirely new; while small-scale and isolated before the \nconflict, they became ubiquitous in the course of the war. Duffield has argued that the \nwar is \u201can axis around which social, economic and political relations are measured \nand reshaped to establish new forms of agency and legitimacy\u201d (2001, p. 136). \n13 Recent research shows that, in terms of GDP per head in purchasing power parity \n(PPP), the position of a number of countries in the region has deteriorated compared \nwith the EU15 in 1910-2004 (cf. Kekic, 2005). \n14 This holds true for both types of actors: those with an informal\/criminal slant as \nwell as others such as service-delivery NGOs which took over provision of some of \nthe services normally provided by state. \n15 The outcome of Croatian elections has at times been determined by the diaspora \nvote. \n16 Funding from the Croatian state to Bosnian Croat structures extended informally \nthrough 2000; from then on, much smaller amounts were re-directed through the \nBosnian Federation government structures. Funding from Croat diasporas continues \nwith initiatives promoting the goal of Bosnian Croat autonomy.  \n17 The provision of services by international non- governmental organisations can \nhave similar effect.  \n 46 \n                                                                                                                                            \n18 This then provides a direct route through which organised crime becomes an actor \ninfluencing local processes. \n19 Reasons for the poor effectiveness of some internationally sponsored schemes are \norganisational issues, inadequate funding and, in case of development assistance, \ncorruption. \n20 Organised crime also flourishes in a strongly interventionist state. \n21 Not even Albania, which despite bouts of violence, escaped a full scale conflict, has \nbeen safe from it.   \n22 Severing the links with organised crime has been daunting, even when attempted \nunder international pressure.  This was illustrated by the assassination of Serbia\u2019s \nPrime Minister Zoran Dindji\u0107,  killed because he was attempting to clamp down on \norganised crime. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"}
