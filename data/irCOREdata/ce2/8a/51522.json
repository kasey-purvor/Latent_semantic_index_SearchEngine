Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n2 \n \nABSTRACT 34 \nSedentary aging results in a diminished rapid cutaneous vasodilator response to 35 \nlocal heating. We investigated whether this diminished response was due to altered 36 \ncontributions of noradrenergic sympathetic nerves; assessing 1) the age-related 37 \ndecline and, 2) the effect of aerobic fitness. We measured skin blood flow (SkBF) 38 \n(laser-Doppler flowmetry) in young (24\u00b11 yr) and older (64\u00b11 yr) endurance-trained 39 \nand sedentary men (n=7 per group) at baseline and during 35 min of local skin 40 \nheating to 42 \u00b0C at three forearm sites: 1) untreated; 2) bretylium tosylate (BT), 41 \npreventing neurotransmitter release from noradrenergic sympathetic nerves; and 3) 42 \nyohimbine and propranolol (YP), antagonising \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. SkBF 43 \nwas converted to cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) (SkBF\/mean arterial 44 \npressure) and normalized to maximal CVC (%CVCmax) achieved by skin heating to 45 \n44 \u00b0C. Pharmacological agents were administered using microdialysis. In the young 46 \ntrained, the rapid vasodilator response was reduced at the BT and YP sites (P<0.05); 47 \nby contrast, in the young sedentary and older trained, YP had no effect (P>0.05) but 48 \ntreatment with BT did (P>0.05). Neither BT nor YP treatments affected the rapid 49 \nvasodilator response in the older sedentary group (P>0.05). These data suggest that 50 \nthe age-related reduction in the rapid vasodilator response is due to an impairment 51 \nof sympathetic-dependent mechanisms, which can be partly attenuated with habitual 52 \naerobic exercise. Rapid vasodilation involves noradrenergic neurotransmitters in 53 \nyoung trained men, and non-adrenergic sympathetic cotransmitters (e.g., 54 \nneuropeptide Y) in young sedentary and older trained men, possibly as a 55 \ncompensatory mechanism. Finally, in older sedentary men, the rapid vasodilation 56 \nappears not to involve the sympathetic system. 57 \n 58 \n 59 \n 60 \n 61 \n 62 \n 63 \n 64 \n 65 \n 66 \n 67 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n3 \n \nINTRODUCTION 68 \nIn humans, the cutaneous circulation performs a major role in the control of body 69 \ntemperature through the level of its perfusion. Under conditions of heat stress, skin 70 \nblood flow (SkBF) can increase to greater than 6 L\/min (30). In contrast, during 71 \nexposure to extreme cold, SkBF can fall to almost zero (17).  In non-glabrous (hairy) 72 \nskin, the SkBF response to thermal stimuli local to the site of measurement appears 73 \nto be achieved via a sympathetic noradrenergic system releasing norepinephrine 74 \n(NE) and the cotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) and a non-adrenergic system that 75 \nis heavily dependent on nitric oxide (NO) (12-13, 15). 76 \n 77 \nThe skin hyperemic response to a non-painful, rapid heat stimulus is commonly used 78 \nas a test of microvascular and endothelial function (6, 22) and involves at least two 79 \nindependent phases: an initial, rapid transitory rise, followed by a nadir, ultimately 80 \nsucceeded by a secondary rise and prolonged plateau (20, 23). The specific 81 \nmechanisms underpinning these phases are complex and not completely understood. 82 \nThe rapid initial peak of the vasodilator response is thought to be primarily mediated 83 \nby an axon reflex via activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV-1) 84 \nreceptors in C-fibre afferent nociceptive neurones (41). These sensory neurones 85 \nmight increase skin blood flow (SkBF) through the release of neuropeptides such as 86 \ncalcitonin gene-related peptide and\/or substance P (4); however, these theories 87 \nhave yet to be directly tested. Additionally, NO has been shown to contribute 88 \nmodestly to the initial peak of the vasodilator response to rapid local heating (20, 23). 89 \nThe secondary rise and plateau in SkBF, in contrast, is heavily dependent on NO 90 \nsynthesis as inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) reduces this phase by approximately 91 \n70% (20, 23). 92 \n 93 \nRecent work (12-13, 15) supports the somewhat counterintuitive concept that 94 \ncutaneous noradrenergic sympathetic nerves are also involved in the cutaneous 95 \nvasodilator response to local heating. Indeed, pre-synaptic blockade of 96 \nneurotransmitter release from these nerves with bretylium tosylate (BT) abolishes 97 \nthe rapid vasodilator (initial) phase and greatly reduces the overall vasodilator 98 \nresponse to slow local heating (+0.1\u00b0C\u00b7min-1) (13, 15). By performing separate post-99 \nsynaptic antagonism of \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and of Y1 receptors, Hodges 100 \net al. (13) found evidence of roles for both NE and the cotransmitter NPY. Adrenergic 101 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n4 \n \ninvolvement in thermal hyperemia also has a rate dependency: the initial peak 102 \nevoked by slow local heating (+0.1\u00b0C\u00b7min-1) is completely abolished by pre-treatment 103 \nwith BT; by contrast, the initial peak evoked by rapid local heating (+2\u00b0C\u00b7min-1) is 104 \nonly halved under conditions of sympathetic nerve blockade (12). 105 \n 106 \nThe initial rapid peak and secondary plateau are diminished with sedentary aging (24, 107 \n34). Whereas the diminished secondary plateau of older adults is largely explained 108 \nby attenuated NO-mediated vasodilation (2, 24), the mechanisms underpinning the 109 \ndecline in the initial rapid vasodilation are less clear. Diminished functioning of local 110 \nsensory nerves might be implicated, because sensory nerve function blockade using 111 \na topical local anesthetic cream abolishes the difference between young adults and 112 \nolder sedentary adults (33). In that study, the size of the initial peak and the 113 \ncontribution of sensory nerves to the initial peak were similar between older 114 \nendurance-trained adults and younger adults, suggesting that regular aerobic 115 \nexercise can preserve sensory nerve-mediated vasodilator function in older adults. 116 \nPrevious studies have demonstrated that aging is associated with decreases in skin 117 \nsympathetic efferent outflow in response to heat exposure (10) and vasoconstrictor 118 \nresponsiveness to NE (36, 40). Therefore, the diminished initial peak of sedentary 119 \nolder adults might also involve a decreased contribution of noradrenergic 120 \nsympathetic nerves. 121 \n 122 \nHence, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the role of cutaneous 123 \nnoradrenergic sympathetic nerves in the age-related decline in the initial rapid 124 \nvasodilator response to local heating. A secondary aim was to further investigate the 125 \neffect of regular aerobic exercise (as reflected by a higher aerobic fitness) on the 126 \ninitial peak in both young and older adults, assessing whether the effects of habitual 127 \nexercise on cutaneous vasodilation can be explained by altered contributions of 128 \nsympathetic neurotransmitters. We hypothesized that the contribution of 129 \nnoradrenergic sympathetic nerves to the initial vasodilator response would be 130 \ngreater in the young and well-trained individuals compared to the older sedentary 131 \nindividuals. 132 \n 133 \n 134 \n 135 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n5 \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 136 \nEthics approval 137 \nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sheffield Hallam University and 138 \nconducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written, 139 \ninformed consent was obtained before participants entered the study. 140 \n 141 \nParticipants 142 \nWe recruited 28 men who were equally divided among four groups: young 143 \nendurance-trained (24 \u00b1 1 yr), young sedentary (25 \u00b1 1 yr), older endurance-trained 144 \n(64 \u00b1 1 yr) and older sedentary (64 \u00b1 1 yr). The trained participants were recruited 145 \nfrom running and cycling clubs in and around Sheffield, UK. They had all performed 146 \nvigorous endurance exercise for \u22653 times\u00b7week-1, \u226530 min\u00b7session-1 and \u22655 years. 147 \nThe sedentary participants reported undertaking no regular exercise. All participants 148 \nwere healthy, non-smokers, free from cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and 149 \nwere not taking any medications. The participants attended the testing facility on two 150 \nseparate occasions. For both sessions, they were asked to refrain from caffeine, 151 \nalcohol, and exercise for 24 h prior to their attendance. The participants are the 152 \nsame as those described in a recently published article by our group (33). 153 \n 154 \nVisit 1: Assessment of cardiopulmonary fitness 155 \nParticipants completed a continuous, incremental cycling test to volitional exhaustion 156 \non an electronically-braked cycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport, Lode, The 157 \nNetherlands). Pedalling frequency was self-selected within the range of 60 to 90 158 \nrev\u00b7min-1. After a 2-min warm-up against no resistance (0 W), the intensity of 159 \nexercise was increased by 20 to 30 W\u00b7min-1. Participants were encouraged to 160 \ncontinue cycling to volitional exhaustion or until a plateau in oxygen consumption 161 \nwas observed. Heart rate was recorded continuously by electrocardiogram 162 \n(Cardioperfect, Welch Allyn, USA). The volume of oxygen consumed during exercise 163 \nwas calculated from minute ventilation, measured using a pneumotach, and 164 \nsimultaneous breath-by-breath analysis of expired gas fractions (Ultima CardiO2, 165 \nMedGraphics, USA). Gas analysers and flow probes were calibrated before each 166 \ntest. Oxygen consumption was expressed relative to body mass (mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1). 167 \nMaximal oxygen consumption (V\uf026 O2max) was calculated as the highest consecutive 168 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n6 \n \n20-second period of gas exchange data in the last minute before volitional 169 \nexhaustion, which generally occurred due to leg fatigue and\/or breathlessness. 170 \n 171 \nVisit 2: Assessment of SkBF responses to local heating 172 \nInstrumentation 173 \nThe microvascular assessments were performed in a temperature-controlled room 174 \n(22 to 24\u00b0C) with participants resting supine and the experimental (left) arm 175 \npositioned at heart level for the entire protocol. Blood pressure was measured 176 \nautomatically on the right arm every 2 min (Dinamap Dash 2500, GE Healthcare, 177 \nUSA).  178 \n 179 \nTwo microdialysis fibers (Linear 30, CMA Microdialysis Ltd, Stockholm, Sweden) 180 \nwith a membrane length of 10 mm and a 6-kDa molecular mass cut-off were placed 181 \n~5 cm apart in the dermal layer of skin on the ventral aspect of the left forearm. 182 \nBefore implantation, the skin was temporarily anesthetised by applying an ice pack 183 \nfor 5 min (11). A 21-gauge needle was introduced aseptically into the dermis along a 184 \nlength of ~2.5 cm before exiting. A microdialysis fiber was threaded through the 185 \nlumen of the needle, before removing the needle to leave the fiber in place. All 186 \nmicrodialysis fibers were placed in this manner. To allow for the effects of the 187 \ninsertion trauma to subside, we waited 1.5-2 h before beginning the protocol (13).  188 \n 189 \nTo obtain an index of SkBF, cutaneous red blood cell flux was measured using laser 190 \nDoppler flowmetry (Periflux 5000 System, Perimed AB, J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla, Sweden) at the two 191 \nmicrodialysis sites, and at a third \"no fiber\" control site. Local heater discs (Model 192 \n455, Perimed AB) were used to control local skin temperature and integrating laser 193 \nDoppler probes (Model 413, Perimed AB) were placed in the centre of each local 194 \nheating disc.  195 \n 196 \nDrugs 197 \nBlockade of neurotransmitter release from sympathetic adrenergic nerves was 198 \nachieved at one of the microdialysis sites by administering a 20 mM solution of BT 199 \n(US Pharmacopeia, Rockville, MD, USA). Administration of BT causes a selective 200 \nand localised blockade of neurotransmitter release from cutaneous sympathetic 201 \nadrenergic nerves lasting several hours (19). 202 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n7 \n \n 203 \nBlockade of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors was achieved by administering a 204 \ncombination of 5 mM yohimbine (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, US) and 1 mM 205 \npropranolol (Sigma Aldrich) to antagonise those receptors. Herein, these skin sites 206 \nwill be termed the YP sites. Yohimbine is traditionally regarded as an \u03b12-adrenergic 207 \nantagonist; however, this combination and concentration of adrenergic antagonists 208 \nhas previously been shown to be effective in inhibiting the cutaneous vascular 209 \nresponses to exogenous NE (18, 31), suggesting that all \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenergic 210 \nreceptors are blocked. 211 \n 212 \nAs for previous studies investigating the role of sympathetic-dependent mechanisms 213 \nin cutaneous vasodilation, all drugs were infused at a rate of 4 \u03bcL\u00b7min-1 (12-13). 214 \n 215 \nProtocol 216 \nData collection began after the trauma resolution period. Baseline data were 217 \nrecorded for 5 min with the local heating disc temperature at 33 \u00b0C. The temperature 218 \nof the discs was then increased at a rate of 1 \u00b0C every 10 s to 42 \u00b0C (34) and held 219 \nconstant at this temperature for 35 min (32). After this, local heating temperature was 220 \nincreased to 44 \u00b0C for 10 min to induce maximal SkBF (37). No participants 221 \nexperienced any pain or discomfort during the local heating protocol. 222 \n 223 \nData collection and analysis 224 \nSkBF data were divided by mean arterial pressure to calculate cutaneous vascular 225 \nconductance (CVC). CVC data were expressed as raw values (au\/mmHg) and as a 226 \npercentage of maximal vasodilation recorded during local heating to 44 \u00b0C 227 \n(%CVCmax). Because of the rapid and transient nature of the initial peak responses, 228 \nstable 30-s periods of SkBF were used for analysis. For the secondary plateau and 229 \nmaximal SkBF phases, stable 2-min periods of SkBF were used for analysis.  230 \n 231 \nTo assess the contribution of sympathetic adrenergic nerves to the initial peak in 232 \neach group, we compared the SkBF responses between the control and drug sites. 233 \nFor example, similar responses between all three sites would suggest that NE and 234 \nNPY do not contribute to the initial peak. If the initial peak is equally depressed at the 235 \nBT and YP sites, this would indicate that NE contributes to the initial peak, whereas 236 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n8 \n \nNPY does not. Finally, if the initial peak is depressed at the BT site, but not the YP 237 \nsite, this would indicate that NPY contributes to the initial peak, whereas NE does 238 \nnot. 239 \n 240 \nParticipant characteristics were compared among groups using a one-way 241 \nindependent ANOVA (SAS v9.1, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The effects of age, 242 \ntraining status, and pharmacological manipulations on hemodynamic measures 243 \nwere assessed using a three-way ANOVA. Where significant interaction effects were 244 \nobserved, Tukey's post hoc analyses were used to identify significant differences in 245 \nthe pairwise comparisons. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05 and all data are 246 \npresented as means \u00b1 S.E.M. 247 \n 248 \n 249 \n 250 \n 251 \n 252 \n 253 \n 254 \n 255 \n 256 \n 257 \n 258 \n 259 \n 260 \n 261 \n 262 \n 263 \n 264 \n 265 \n 266 \n 267 \n 268 \n 269 \n 270 \nTew et al.

Briefly, 273 \nthe groups did not differ in body mass, stature, or resting systolic or diastolic blood 274 \npressure (P>0.05). All participants were normotensive and achieved V\uf026 O2max 275 \naccording to standard criteria (16). The V\uf026 O2max of the young trained (58 \u00b1 3 mL\u00b7kg-276 \n1\u00b7min-1) was higher (P<0.05) than that of the young sedentary (40 \u00b1 2 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1), 277 \nolder trained (44 \u00b1 2 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1), and older sedentary (28 \u00b1 2 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1). The 278 \nV\uf026 O2max of the older sedentary was lower than that of all other groups (P<0.05), and 279 \nthere was no difference between the young sedentary and older trained (P>0.05).  280 \n 281 \nCVC responses 282 \nLocal heating resulted in the characteristic biphasic SkBF response previously 283 \ndescribed (23), i.e., an initial rapid increase and peak at the onset of heating, a brief 284 \nnadir, and then a slower rise and plateau. This pattern was seen in all four groups 285 \nand at all skin sites. 286 \n 287 \nNormalized baseline 288 \nBaseline CVC did not differ among groups at each skin site (P>0.05). For example, 289 \ncontrol-site baseline CVC for the young trained, young sedentary, older trained and 290 \nolder sedentary was 7 \u00b1 1, 8 \u00b1 1, 7 \u00b1 1, and 8 \u00b1 1 %CVCmax, respectively (P>0.05). 291 \nFurthermore, baseline CVC did not differ among skin sites within any of the groups 292 \n(P>0.05) (e.g. young sedentary control site: 8 \u00b1 1, BT site: 9 \u00b1 1, and YP site: 9 \u00b1 293 \n1 %CVCmax), indicating no effect of pharmacological treatment. 294 \n 295 \nNormalized initial peak 296 \nFigure 1 shows the normalized initial peak data for all groups at the control, BT, and 297 \nYP sites. At the control site, the initial peak of the young trained and older trained (82 298 \n\u00b1 3 and 79 \u00b1 3 %CVCmax, respectively) was higher (P<0.05) than that of the young 299 \nsedentary and older sedentary (74 \u00b1 3 and 66 \u00b1 5 %CVCmax, respectively). The 300 \ninitial peak of the older sedentary was also lower than that of the young sedentary 301 \n(P<0.05), and there was no difference between the young trained and older trained 302 \n(P>0.05). The difference in the initial peak between trained and sedentary groups 303 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n10 \n \nwas more pronounced in the older men compared to the young men (19 \u00b1 4 vs. 11 \u00b1 304 \n2 %, respectively; P<0.05). 305 \n 306 \nThe initial peak at the BT site was lower (P<0.05) than that at the control site in all 307 \ngroups except the older sedentary (control minus BT: young trained 10 \u00b1 3, young 308 \nsedentary 7 \u00b1 2, older trained 9 \u00b1 2, older sedentary 2 \u00b1 1 %CVCmax) (Fig. 1). In 309 \naddition, the initial peak at the BT site did not differ between the young trained, 310 \nyoung sedentary, and older trained (P>0.05), whereas the responses of the older 311 \nsedentary were lower than those of the young trained and older trained (P<0.05). 312 \n 313 \nIn the young trained, the initial peak at the YP site was lower than that at the control 314 \nsite (control minus YP: 11 \u00b1 3 %CVCmax; P<0.05); however, the initial peak was 315 \nsimilar between the BT and YP sites (72 \u00b1 6 and 72 \u00b1 4 %CVCmax, respectively; 316 \nP>0.05), suggesting that NE contributes to the initial peak in young trained adults, 317 \nwhereas NPY does not (Fig. 1). In the young sedentary and older trained, the initial 318 \npeak at the YP site (75 \u00b1 2 and 77 \u00b1 3 %CVCmax, respectively) did not differ 319 \n(P>0.05) to that at the control site (74 \u00b1 3 and 79 \u00b1 4 %CVCmax, respectively). 320 \nConsidering the reduced vasodilator response under conditions of BT but not YP in 321 \nthese groups, this suggests a role for NPY, but not NE, in the initial peak of these 322 \ngroups. As with BT treatment, YP did not effect the initial peak in the older sedentary 323 \n(control minus YP: 0 \u00b1 1 %CVCmax; P>0.05). 324 \n 325 \nNormalized plateau 326 \nFigure 2 shows the normalized plateau data for all groups at the control, BT, and YP 327 \nsites. The plateau at the control site did not differ among groups (P>0.05). The 328 \nplateau at the BT site was lower (P<0.05) than that at the control site for the young 329 \ntrained (71 \u00b1 1 vs. 91 \u00b1 2 %CVCmax, respectively) and older trained (85 \u00b1 3 vs. 93 \u00b1 330 \n2 %CVCmax, respectively). In contrast, the plateau was similar (P>0.05) between BT 331 \nand control sites in the young sedentary (85 \u00b1 5 vs. 90 \u00b1 3 %CVCmax, respectively) 332 \nand older sedentary (91 \u00b1 3 vs. 94 \u00b1 1 %CVCmax, respectively). The plateau at the 333 \nYP site in the young trained and older trained (90 \u00b1 2 and 92 \u00b1 3 %CVCmax, 334 \nrespectively) did not differ to that at the control site (P>0.05). In these groups, BT but 335 \nnot YP reduced vasodilatation; this suggests a role for NPY, but not NE, in the 336 \nplateau of these groups. As with BT treatment, YP did not affect (P>0.05) the plateau 337 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n11 \n \nin the young sedentary and older sedentary (88 \u00b1 2 and 91 \u00b1 2 %CVCmax, 338 \nrespectively). 339 \n 340 \nRaw CVC responses 341 \nThe findings for the raw (non-normalized) data (Table 1) are similar to those for the 342 \nnormalized data. There was no effect of group or treatment on baseline responses 343 \n(P>0.05). The control-site initial peak was higher in the young trained compared to all 344 \nother groups (P<0.05), whereas the response of the older sedentary was lower than 345 \nall other groups (P<0.05). There was no difference between the young sedentary 346 \nand older trained (P>0.05). The control-site plateau was higher in the young trained 347 \ncompared to all other groups (P<0.05), and there were no differences among the 348 \nremaining three groups (P>0.05). Treatment with BT and YP reduced the initial peak 349 \nand plateau in the young trained only (P<0.05), and these phases did not differ 350 \nbetween groups at the BT and YP sites (P>0.05). Finally, in the young trained, the 351 \ninitial peak did not differ between BT and YP sites (P>0.05), whereas the plateau 352 \nwas lower at the BT site compared to the YP site (P<0.05). 353 \n 354 \n 355 \n 356 \n 357 \n 358 \n 359 \n 360 \n 361 \n 362 \n 363 \n 364 \n 365 \n 366 \n 367 \n 368 \n 369 \n 370 \n 371 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n12 \n \nDISCUSSION 372 \nThe main novel findings from this study are: i) the age-related decline in the rapid 373 \nskin hyperemic response to localized heating is partially explained by a diminished 374 \ncontribution of noradrenergic sympathetic nerves; ii) the contribution of 375 \nnoradrenergic sympathetic nerves to the initial peak is greater in individuals who 376 \nhave a higher aerobic fitness; and, iii) the sympathetic neurotransmitters contributing 377 \nto the initial peak vary between young trained, young sedentary and older trained 378 \nadults. Our data suggest that NE contributes to the initial peak of the young trained, 379 \nwhereas NPY does not. Conversely, NPY seems to play a role in the initial peak of 380 \nthe young sedentary and older trained, whereas NE does not. In the older sedentary, 381 \nthere is a significant reduction in the initial peak and no involvement of noradrenergic 382 \nsympathetic nerves.   383 \n 384 \nEffects of aging on the initial peak and potential mechanisms 385 \nThe observation that the rapid skin hyperemic response to local heating was higher 386 \nin both young groups compared to the older sedentary group is consistent with 387 \nprevious findings (24, 33-34). It has been suggested that a smaller initial peak might 388 \nbe associated with a greater risk of local tissue damage in response to directly 389 \napplied heat (24, 41). This seems logical since a rapid increase in SkBF will 390 \nminimize the heat transferred to the underlying tissues; however, further research is 391 \nneeded to substantiate this suggestion, especially since the initial peak normally 392 \ndoes not usually occur until 3 to 4 min after the initiation of skin heating. In addition, 393 \nthe age-related decline in the initial peak might be associated with impaired wound 394 \nhealing. Indeed, the magnitude of the initial peak reflects sensory nerve function 395 \n(e.g., (33)), which is known to be an important contributory factor to wound healing 396 \ncapacity (29). 397 \n 398 \nOur current findings suggest that the age-related decline is partly due to a 399 \ndiminished contribution of noradrenergic sympathetic nerves. Indeed, sympathetic 400 \nnerve blockade decreased the initial peak in the young, but not the older sedentary, 401 \nsuch that the between-group difference in the initial peak was smaller at the BT site 402 \nthan that at the control site (Figure 1). This finding may be due to the generalized 403 \ndecline in skin sympathetic efferent activity that occurs with primary aging (10), 404 \nalthough other factors such as a reduced release and post-junctional binding of 405 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n13 \n \nsympathetic transmitters cannot be excluded. To improve our understanding of this 406 \nmatter, further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which noradrenergic 407 \nsympathetic nerves contribute to local heating-induced cutaneous vasodilation. 408 \nPrevious research suggests that noradrenergic sympathetic nerves may sensitize 409 \nthe vascular responsiveness to local skin heating, which would affect the initial rise 410 \n(axon reflex) in blood flow. Indeed, Houghton et al. (15) reported that low-dose NE 411 \ninfusion decreased the temperature threshold of the axon reflex response to slow 412 \nlocal heating, and Drummond and Lipnicki (7) observed that iontophoresis of NE 413 \ncaused an axon reflex response in immediately adjacent skin that was blocked by 414 \npre-treatment with a local anesthetic cream. There might also be an important 415 \ninteraction between NE and\/or NPY and the production of NO via endothelial NOS (1, 416 \n5, 38), which would probably contribute more to the plateau phase of the local 417 \nheating response; however, this is yet to be directly tested.  418 \n 419 \nImportantly, the age-related decrement in the initial peak was not completely 420 \nabolished by sympathetic nerve blockade, indicating that other factors are involved. 421 \nOne such factor might be a diminished functioning of heat-sensitive nociceptors, 422 \nsince sensory nerve function blockade has been shown to abolish the difference in 423 \nthe initial peak between young adults and older sedentary adults (33). Nitric oxide 424 \nmight also be implicated given that it contributes modestly to the initial peak (20, 23); 425 \nhowever, a previous study showed that NOS inhibition did not abolish the difference 426 \nin the initial peak between young and older adults (24). Nevertheless, NO might be 427 \ninvolved via potential interactions with sensory nerves (41) and\/or noradrenergic 428 \nsympathetic nerves (13). Further research is needed to understand how 429 \nnoradrenergic sympathetic nerves, sensory nerves, and NO interact in the rapid 430 \nvasodilator response to local heating and what their respective roles are in the age-431 \nrelated decline in the initial peak. The current data would suggest that there is a 432 \nconsiderable degree of redundancy among these systems, similar to what is known 433 \nwith reflex vasodilation in response to increases in core temperature (3).  434 \n 435 \nEffects of aerobic fitness on the initial peak and potential mechanisms 436 \nThe age-related decline in the initial peak was not present in the older trained, which 437 \nis consistent with our previous findings (33-34) and indicates that participating in 438 \nregular aerobic exercise preserves the capacity to rapidly increase SkBF in response 439 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n14 \n \nto skin heating into advanced age. Exercise training also appears to be associated 440 \nwith a higher initial peak in young adults; however, the impact of exercise training 441 \nseems greater in older adults (Figure 1), perhaps because these individuals have 442 \ngreater potential for improvement relative to their younger counterparts. This is 443 \nconsistent with what is known about conduit artery and resistance vessel function; 444 \nexercise training seems to enhance vascular function to a greater extent in those 445 \nwith depressed function at baseline (35).  446 \n 447 \nThe difference in SkBF between the control and BT sites was lower in the sedentary 448 \ngroups, indicating that regular aerobic exercise can also increase the contribution of 449 \nnoradrenergic sympathetic nerves to the initial peak in both young and older adults. 450 \nAs for the aging data, the underpinning mechanisms of this finding are unclear. 451 \nNevertheless, the current study provides novel and important data on the effects of 452 \naging and aerobic fitness on local heating-induced cutaneous vasodilation and the 453 \ncontribution of sympathetic neurotransmitters to this response. Further research is 454 \nneeded to identify the acute and chronic effects of exercise on cutaneous 455 \nneurovascular function, including noradrenergic sympathetic nerve function. 456 \n 457 \nGroup-specific roles of NE and NPY in the initial peak 458 \nOur findings also indicate that the sympathetic neurotransmitters contributing to the 459 \ninitial peak vary between young trained, young sedentary, and older trained adults. 460 \nIndeed, NE seemed to play a role in the initial peak of the young trained and NPY did 461 \nnot. By contrast, NPY and not NE appeared to play a role in the initial peak of the 462 \nyoung sedentary and older trained groups. Neither NE nor NPY appear to be 463 \ninvolved in the relatively diminished initial peak of the older sedentary. Aging and 464 \nsedentary behavior lead to an increase in sympathetic outflow and it is under 465 \nstressful conditions that NPY appears to play a role in sympathetic function (26, 42). 466 \nWe propose our data indicate that a role for NPY only occurs as a compensatory 467 \nmechanism. NE is the neurotransmitter usually used (young trained), but with a 468 \nsedentary lifestyle (young untrained) or primary aging (older trained) it would appear 469 \nthat NPY is required to compensate for a loss of adrenergic function. Currently, we 470 \nare unable to speculate as to whether this is due to pre- or post-synaptic alterations, 471 \ni.e. whether these changes are due to alterations in transmitter synthesis and 472 \nrelease or in receptor density or affinity. The combination of a sedentary lifestyle and 473 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n15 \n \naging appears to result in a complete loss of sympathetic involvement, such that the 474 \ninitial peak responses under control conditions for the older sedentary group were 475 \nsomewhat similar to the responses achieved at the BT-treated sites for the other 476 \nthree groups. Also note the absence of any change following treatment with BT or 477 \nYP. 478 \n 479 \nEffects of age and aerobic fitness on the plateau and maximum CVC 480 \nresponses and the role of noradrenergic sympathetic nerves 481 \nThe secondary plateau of the SkBF response to local heating, did not differ between 482 \ngroups when the data were normalized to maximal CVC (Figure 2), which is in 483 \ncontrast to some of the previous studies that have investigated the impact of age and 484 \nexercise training on local heating-induced SkBF responses (8-9, 14, 21, 24, 27-28, 485 \n39), but not all (2, 25). However, this finding might simply reflect our approach of 486 \nnormalizing data to CVC values recorded during local heating at 44 \u00b0C. Although this 487 \nmethod, which is used to account for the wide heterogeneity in capillary density 488 \nacross the forearm, is acceptable in healthy young adults and in mechanistically-489 \ndriven, carefully controlled studies (22), it might be inappropriate for comparing data 490 \nbetween young and older adults (24-25), because of the age-associated decline in 491 \nthe maximal SkBF response to local heating (21). For example, the CVC responses 492 \nduring the plateau phase were similar between groups when expressed 493 \nas %CVCmax, but lower in the older groups compared to the young trained when 494 \nexpressed as raw CVC (Table 1). Therefore, although participants from all groups 495 \nreached a similar %CVCmax, lower maximal CVC values in aged skin would 496 \nprobably translate to a lower absolute SkBF for a given %CVCmax. Because of this 497 \nissue, we chose to present data both as raw CVC and %CVCmax. Reassuringly, the 498 \ninterpretation of the initial peak data did not change greatly between these different 499 \nmethods. 500 \n 501 \nOur findings indicate that the contribution of cutaneous sympathetic nerves to the 502 \nplateau phase of heat-induced vasodilation is dependent on the individual's aerobic 503 \nfitness. Indeed, sympathetic nerve blockade using BT decreased the plateau in the 504 \nyoung and older trained, but not in the young and older sedentary groups (Figure 2). 505 \nThree other studies have demonstrated that cutaneous noradrenergic sympathetic 506 \nnerves contribute to the plateau in young healthy adults (12-13, 15). The data of 507 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n16 \n \nthese studies are not directly comparable with our own because two of the three 508 \nstudies used a slow heating protocol (+0.1 \u00b0C\u00b7min-1) (13, 15), and the fitness\/training 509 \nstatus of the participants was unclear throughout. Whereas both NE and NPY 510 \ncontribute to the plateau response to slow local heating (13, 15), it seems that the 511 \nsympathetic-related contribution to rapid local heating (in the trained groups) 512 \ninvolves NPY only. Further research is needed to help understand this difference 513 \nand how exercise training alters the contribution of sympathetic neurotransmitters. 514 \n 515 \nA final curious observation that warrants discussion is that maximal raw CVC in the 516 \nyoung trained group was significantly greater at the control sites compared with the 517 \nBT and YP treated sites (Table 1). No differences were observed among the sites in 518 \nthe other three groups. This may be due to the fact that the BT and YP treated sites 519 \nhad microdialysis fibers present, while the control site did not; however, as this 520 \nscenario did not occur in any of the other groups we feel this is unlikely. What this 521 \nmight indicate, is that, in young trained adults, either noradrenergic sympathetic 522 \nnerves contribute to the maximal CVC response to local heating at 44 \u00b0C (similar to 523 \nwhat we have observed for initial peak and plateau phase data) or that local heating 524 \nto 44 \u00b0C was an insufficient stimulus to elicit a maximal vasodilator response. As we 525 \nare unable to definitively state whether or not \"true\" maximum CVC was obtained at 526 \nevery skin site in the different groups, inspection of the raw CVC responses (Table 1) 527 \nis particularly important in the interpretation of our results. Reassuringly, both 528 \nmethods of data presentation support our interpretation of the initial peak results. 529 \n 530 \nExperimental considerations 531 \nIt might be argued that our assessment of drug effects was clouded by the fact that 532 \nwe did not have a microdialysis fiber at the control site. Indeed, it has previously 533 \nbeen demonstrated that fiber placement alone decreases the peak reflex cutaneous 534 \nvasodilator response to whole body heating (11). However, that study also showed 535 \nthat this attenuation did not occur if ice was applied for 5 min before fiber placement. 536 \nSince we used ice in this manner, any reported between-site differences are 537 \nprobably due to the action of the drugs and not the absence of a microdialysis fiber 538 \nat the control site. Furthermore, our pilot tests (n=5) investigating this issue indicated 539 \nthat the SkBF response to rapid local heating is not affected by ice treatment + fiber 540 \nplacement (e.g., normalized initial peak: fiber 71 \u00b1 7 %CVCmax vs. no-fiber 67 \u00b1 541 \nTew et al. Sympathetic nerves, thermal hyperemia and aging \n \n17 \n \n7 %CVCmax; raw maximum: fiber 2.56 \u00b1 0.22 au\/mmHg vs. no-fiber 2.36 \u00b1 0.12 542 \nau\/mmHg; P = 0.13 and P = 0.40, respectively). 543 \n 544 \nAnother potential limitation is that we did not use a NPY-specific antagonist such as 545 \nBIBP-3226 to assess the contribution of NPY to the thermal hyperemic response. 546 \nHodges et al. (13) previously assessed the contribution of NE and NPY to the 547 \ncutaneous vasodilator response to slow local heating using a 4-site \"Latin-square\" 548 \ndesign: (i) control, (ii) \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonism, (iii) Y1-receptor 549 \nantagonism, and (iv) a combination of (ii) and (iii). We could not use this approach 550 \nbecause we currently only have a 3-channel laser Doppler flowmeter. Nevertheless, 551 \nwith only 3 sites (control, neurotransmitter block, and \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoceptor 552 \nantagonism), we were essentially able to obtain the effects of NE and, indirectly NPY. 553 \n 554 \nIn summary, we present a comparison of cutaneous microvascular responses to 555 \nlocalised heating between young and older endurance-trained and sedentary 556 \nindividuals, with specific focus on the initial vasodilator response and the contribution 557 \nof noradrenergic sympathetic nerves to this phase. At untreated control sites, the 558 \ninitial vasodilator response to local heating was lower in the older sedentary 559 \ncompared to both young groups. The lower responses of the older sedentary 560 \nappeared to be partly explained by diminished contribution of noradrenergic 561 \nsympathetic nerves. Our findings also indicate that the sympathetic contribution to 562 \nthe initial peak can be preserved into advanced age by maintaining a high level of 563 \naerobic fitness and\/or participating in regular aerobic exercise. Finally, the 564 \nsympathetic neurotransmitters contributing to the initial peak vary between young 565 \ntrained, young sedentary and older trained men. Specifically, NE seems to play a 566 \nrole in the initial peak of young trained men, whereas NPY does not. Conversely, 567 \nNPY seems to play a role in the initial peak of young sedentary and older trained 568 \nmen, whereas NE does not. Finally, in older sedentary men, the rapid vasodilation is 569 \ngreatly reduced with no involvement of the sympathetic system. 570 \n 571 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 572 \nWe would like to thank the participants for their time and commitment to this study, 573 \nwhich was funded by Sheffield Hallam University. 574 \n 575 \nTew et al.
