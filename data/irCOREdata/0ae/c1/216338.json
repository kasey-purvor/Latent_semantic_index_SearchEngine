ISEWs have been \ndeveloped out of the concern that GNP is not an adequate indicator \nfor either current welfare or the achievement of sustainability, which \nis usually defined as the capacity to provide non-declining future \nwelfare. The main critiques have been that GNP is flawed because (a) \nit does not take the value of household labour, (b) the welfare effects \nof income inequality, and (c) the welfare loss due to environmental \ndegradation into account and (d) considers \u2018defensive expenditures\u2019 \nwrongly as contributions to welfare. \nThe ISEW is supposed to provide a remedy for these and a couple \nof other shortcomings in order to provide a more reliable monetary \nindicator of welfare and sustainability. It attempts to improve earlier \nmeasures of welfare such as Nordhaus and Tobin (1972) and Zolotas \n(1981)2. ISEW-studies have become increasingly popular recently and \nhave prompted widespread attention3. Studies have been undertaken \nfor the U.S. (Daly and Cobb 1989, Cobb and Cobb 1994), the United \nKingdom (Jackson and Marks 1994; Jackson et al. 1997), Germany \n(Diefenbacher 1994), Italy (Guenno and Tiezzi 1996, preliminary \nstudy only), Sweden (Jackson and Stymne 1996) and Austria (Stock-\n 3 \nhammer et al. 1997). What these studies usually show is that the \nISEW of a country has been growing much slower since 1945 than \nher GNP and indeed has been fallen since the early 1980s. \nComputation of an ISEW usually starts from the value of personal \nconsumption expenditures which is a sub-component of GDP since \nGDP = Personal consumption + Public consumption + Investment + \n(Exports - Imports). Consumption expenditures are weighted with \nan index of \u201edistributional inequality\u201c of income (usually a modified \nGini Coefficient). Then, certain welfare relevant contributions are \nadded and certain welfare relevant losses are subtracted. As an ex-\nample take the U.S.-study of Cobb and Cobb (1994): After having \nweighted personal consumption expenditures by a modified Gini \nCoefficient of pre-tax income distribution data, they add the esti-\nmates of the value of the services from household labour, consumer \ndurables and streets and highways. They also add net private in-\nvestment into man-made capital4 and changes in the net interna-\ntional investment position of the U.S. They subtract most expendi-\ntures on health and education because these are regarded as mostly \ndefensive expenditures. They also subtract expenditures on con-\nsumer durables, estimates of the costs of commuting, car accidents, \nand the costs of environmental degradation such as water, air and \nnoise pollution, loss of wetlands and farmlands, the depletion of \nnonrenewable resources and long term environmental damages due \n 4 \nto CO2-emissions. The ISEW is simply the sum of the weighted per-\nsonal consumption expenditures and all the mentioned corrections. \nIn this article, I will argue first that the ISEWs lack a sound theo-\nretical foundation. I will show second that their conclusions are \nhighly dependent on certain key and rather arbitrary assumptions \nabout the weighting of income distribution, the valuing of the deple-\ntion of non-renewable resources and long-term environmental dam-\nage and the neglect of technical progress and increases in human \ncapital. Third, I will argue that the ISEWs and their authors in criti-\ncising GNP for its deficiencies as an indicator of welfare miss the \npoint since GNP was never thought of as providing this function by \nits founders. Finally I will show that the ISEWs rest on two methodo-\nlogical inconsistencies. One is that the ISEW meshes together the \nmeasurement of two entities, current welfare and sustainability, that \nshould be kept separate. This is because an indicator of current wel-\nfare ideally consists of items that are not relevant for questions of \nsustainability and vice versa. The second methodological inconsis-\ntency is that although ISEWs are usually undertaken by economists \nwho are in favour of some stronger version of sustainability (natural \ncapital and certain of its sub-categories are regarded as being not \namenable for substitution), the ISEW implicitly assumes perfect sub-\nstitutability within natural capital and between natural and other \nforms of capital. \n 5 \nThe concluding section draws policy implications out of the \nanalysis. There I argue that it is erroneous to search for a single indi-\ncator that commands enough general agreement to measure welfare \nand sustainability. Scarce time and resources should be put into de-\nveloping new and improving existing indicators of the quality of life \nthat all fall well short of trying to provide one single and clear-cut \nmeasure of welfare and sustainability. At the same time, it should be \nconstantly warned against misinterpreting GNP as an indicator of \nwelfare. \n \nA SHORT REVIEW OF ISEW-STUDIES \nAs mentioned, ISEW-studies have been undertaken for a couple of \nhigh income countries. The detailed methodology varies somewhat \nfrom study to study depending on the authors\u2019 preferences and the \navailability of data. The methodology of the German (Diefenbacher \n1994), Italian (Guenno and Tiezzi 1996), Swedish (Jackson and \nStymne 1996), and early UK-study (Jackson and Marks 1994) is basi-\ncally the same as in Cobb and Cobb (1994) which is itself a revision \nand update of the pioneering U.S. study in Daly and Cobb (1989). \nThe update of the UK-study (Jackson et al. 1997) and the study for \nAustria (Stockhammer et al. 1997) have undertaken some changes in \nmethodology as we will see later on. Importantly, the basic conclu-\nsions are the same for all these studies: Welfare has risen much \nslower than growth rates of GNP would suggest and, indeed, has \n 6 \nfallen from the 1980s onwards. Jackson et al. (1997, p. 2) cite Max-\nNeef (1995, p. 116) who suggests that the computation of an ISEW for \nvarious countries provides evidence for a \u201ethreshold hypothesis\u201c \nwhich holds \u201ethat for every country, economic growth (as conven-\ntionally measured) brings about an improvement in the quality of \nlife, but only up to a point - the threshold point beyond which more \neconomic growth leads to a decline in the quality of life.\u201c \nFor the U.S., e.g., covering the period 1950 to 1990, the ISEW is al-\nready slightly declining during the 1970s by 0.14% per year \u2014 a de-\ncline that is accelerating to 1.26% per year in the 1980s according to \nCobb and Cobb (1994, p. 76). They suggest resource depletion, long-\nterm environmental damage and a more unequal income distribution \nas the main factors for the decline in the ISEW. \nFor Germany, basically the same trend is detected covering the \nperiod 1950 to 1987: Diefenbacher (1994, p. 228) finds after 1980 \u201eon-\ngoing growth of the GNP, but a rather sharp decline of the ISEW\u201c. \nHe provides basically the same reasons for this decline in the Ger-\nman ISEW in the 1980s as Cobb and Cobb (1994) do for the U.S.. \nJackson and Marks (1994, p. 28) in a pilot study for the UK found \nthat over the period 1950 to 1990 \u201ethere is virtually no overall \ngrowth\u201c and the \u201eper capita ISEW in 1990 is just 3% higher than it \nwas in 1950\u201c. This dismal performance is mainly due to the 1980s for \nwhich Jackson and Marks (1994, p. 29) compute a decline in ISEW \nper capita of 4.7% p.a.! They cite rising income inequality and envi-\n 7 \nronmental degradation as major reasons for this dramatic decline in \nthe last decade of their period of analysis (p. 32). \nIn the updated study, Jackson et al. (1997), the period up until \n1996 is covered. As mentioned, the methodology for the computation \nof the revised index has somewhat changed from Jackson and Marks \n(1994). The two main changes are as follows: \n\u2022 Income inequality is measured via computing a so-called Atkinson \nincome instead of using a modified Gini coefficient. The Atkinson \nincome indicates \u201ethe proportion of the present total income that \nwould be required to achieve the same level of social welfare as at \npresent if incomes where equally distributed\u201c (Atkinson 1983, p. \n57). In varying an explicit parameter for aversion against inequal-\nity in income distribution, the valuation of income inequality is \nundertaken explicitly rather than implicitly as is the case with the \nGini coefficient. \n\u2022 Following the methodology of Cobb and Cobb (1994), Jackson and \nMarks (1994, p. 24) computed accumulating long-term environ-\nmental damage by valuing each tonne of coal equivalent of non-\nrenewable fuels consumed in the UK with a constant, rather arbi-\ntrary rate of \u00a33.73 (1985 pounds Sterling)5. Jackson et al. (1997) in-\nstead use explicit cost estimates for long-term environmental \ndamage from global warming. Starting from an estimate of about \n\u00a311 marginal costs per tonne of carbon emitted in 1990, they com-\npute the costs per tonne of carbon in retrospect and up to 1996 \n 8 \nunder the assumption that marginal social costs of carbon emis-\nsion rise over time according to the cumulative level of emissions \nfrom past activities. As Cobb and Cobb (1994) did, Jackson et al. \n(1997) let the costs from long-term damage accumulate over time \nwhich is inappropriate since they use marginal damage costs for \nvaluing CO2-emissions. \nIn spite of these changes in methodology, Jackson et al. (1997) come \nto the same basic conclusions as Jackson and Marks (1994). Mayo, \nMacGillivray and McLaren (1997, p. 1), the short version to Jackson \net al. (1997), detect that \u201esince 1980, according to the ISEW, real well-\nbeing has actually fallen by over 20 per cent\u201c. As key reasons for this \ndecline they cite \u201eenvironmental degradation (in particular depletion \nof non-renewable resources and long-term environmental damage) \nand income inequality\u201c (p. 5). The decline in welfare shown by the \nupdated ISEW is slightly smaller than the one detected by the pilot \nISEW of Jackson and Marks (1994). \u201eThe principal reason for this has \nbeen the choice of a relatively low aversion to income inequality\u201c \n(Jackson et al. 1997, p. 34). \nFor Austria, Stockhammer et al. (1997, p. 32), covering the period \n1955 to 1992, come up with similar findings as the other studies. In \naddition, they cite the substitution of household work with market \nproduction as a major reason for the widening gap between GNP \nand the ISEW: the substitution increases GNP but not the ISEW since \nStockhammer et al. (1997, p. 26) value the contribution of household \n 9 \nlabour to welfare in the ISEW according to market prices. The meth-\nodology Stockhammer et al. (1997) use is different in many respects \nfrom Cobb and Cobb (1994). The main changes are as follows: \n\u2022 Instead of weighting the starting point, personal consumption ex-\npenditures, by a \u201edistribution inequality index\u201c, it is the final \nitem, the ISEW, that is weighted for changes in income distribu-\ntion. \n\u2022 All investment items are multiplied by the productivity of capital \nin order to convert capital stocks into consumption flows. \n\u2022 Most defensive expenditures are computed as the expenditures \nexceeding the level in the base year 1955. The idea is that 1955 \nrepresents something close to a sustainable level. \n\u2022 For air and water pollution potential defensive costs are taken into \naccount as well. Stockhammer et al. (1997, p. 23) define potential \ndefensive costs as \u201ethose costs that would have occurred if society \nhad reacted to environmental devaluation in the same way (con-\ncerning one \u2018unit of pollution\u2019) as it reacts today.\u201c \n\u2022 Whereas Cobb and Cobb (1994) valued the depletion of non-\nrenewable resources by replacement costs for renewable re-\nsources, Stockhammer et al. (1997) valued this item as the value \nadded of the mining sector. Long-term environmental damage is \nvalued similar to Jackson et al. (1997). \n \n 10 \nA CRITIQUE OF THE ISEW \n \nLACKING THEORETICAL FOUNDATION \nOne of the most fundamental problems of an ISEW is that it lacks \na sound theoretical foundation. The corrections are simply under-\ntaken without giving any theoretically sound justification for doing \nso. The correction terms, e.g. those for the depletion of non-\nrenewable resources and the cost of long-term environmental dam-\nage, are not derived from a dynamic optimisation model which \nwould be able to provide a theoretically sound indicator of welfare \n(Hartwick 1990). The same applies to corrections such as for the de-\ncrease in welfare due to traffic costs, health care, environmental pol-\nlution and other expenditures that allegedly only function as a \u2018de-\nfence\u2019 against a decline in welfare. More formal modelling has shown \nthat defensive expenditures should not be netted out of consumption \nexpenditures to arrive at an indicator of welfare (M\u00e4ler 1991, Hamil-\nton 1994, 1996). \nThe ISEW can also be criticised to be arbitrary in the components \nit includes or (implicitly) excludes as contributors to welfare. One \nprominent item, defensive expenditures, provides a case in point. \nThe concept of defensive expenditures is very dubious and elusive \nsince it is rather arbitrary what should count as defensive. This ar-\ngument applies both to the question of what should count as envi-\nronmentally defensive expenditures and to what should count as \n 11 \ndefensive expenditures in general. If health expenditures are defen-\nsive expenditures against illness, why should food and drinking ex-\npenditures not count as defensive expenditures against hunger and \nthirst? Are holiday and entertainment expenditures defensive ex-\npenditures against boredom? Should they all be subtracted from con-\nsumption expenditures? As the revised system of national accounts \nrightly retorts: \u201ePushed to its logical conclusion, scarcely any con-\nsumption improves welfare in this line of argument.\u201c (United Na-\ntions 1993, p. 14). \nMore generally, what determines welfare is open to everybody\u2019s \nown subjective judgement. If you include a correction term for in-\ncome inequality, why not include a correction term for the degree of \npolitical freedom, a correction term for the extent of crime or a cor-\nrection term for the degree of equality between the sexes? And how \ndo you provide a reliable estimate of these correction terms? \n \nRESULTS DEPENDING ON ARBITRARY ASSUMPTIONS \nTo substantiate the critique that the results of the ISEWs depend \non arbitrary assumptions, let us have a closer look at the two main \ndeterminants of the decline in the ISEWs, namely environmental \ndegradation and \u2018worsening\u2019 income distribution. \nLet us start with the latter first: The valuation of the distribution \nof income fails to command general agreement. Mishan (1994, p. 172) \nis right in noting that \u201eall efforts to adjust the welfare index to ac-\n 12 \ncommodate changes in distribution (...)  must be regarded with mis-\ngivings. They are either arbitrary or politically biased and are, there-\nfore, invariably a focus of attack.\u201c Of course, not undertaking any \nexplicit valuation is tantamount to assuming implicitly that the mar-\nginal utility of income is constant and the same for the rich and the \npoor alike - an assumption no less arbitrary than the one embraced \nby the proponents of an ISEW. The fact that the weighting for income \ndistribution exerts a big influence on the ISEW should caution \nagainst adjustments for changes in distribution, however. In Cobb \nand Cobb (1994), e.g., the ISEW for 1990 would be 12% higher with-\nout adjustments for income distribution. In Jackson et al. (1997) per \ncapita ISEW between 1973 and 1996 is declining by 13.4% if income is \nweighted by the inequality index, but is rising by 7.8% without ad-\njustment for changes in distribution. It follows that with appropriate \nweighting widely differing conclusions can be drawn. \nAs far as the ISEW is supposed to measure sustainability, i.e. the \ncapacity to provide future welfare, it should be noted that the distri-\nbution of income at any given point of time does not directly im-\npinge upon the capacity to provide future welfare: First, it is not \nclear a priori that a more equal society is more apt to secure non-\ndeclining future welfare. Torras and Boyce (1997, p. 9) find in an \neconometric cross-section study of the determinants of environ-\nmental quality that, contrary to their expectation, higher income ine-\nquality sometimes tends to improve environmental quality. Also, \n 13 \nsustainability can be hampered by a more equal income distribution. \nGenerally, future welfare is increased by raising current savings. \nHow to do this? Since rich people usually have a higher marginal \npropensity to save than poor people, one way could be to redistrib-\nute income from currently poor to rich people. Hence, the goals of \nintra- and inter-generational distribution can conflict with each other. \nSecond, there is no direct link between the distribution of income \nand sustainability. The personal income distribution can change \nquite dramatically over a course of, say, two or three generations and \nthe current income distribution is almost irrelevant for a representa-\ntive member of a future generation who is likely to be more con-\ncerned about whether the current generation strives for sustainability \nthan about the current income distribution. \nAs concerns long-term environmental damage, the computations \nare largely dependent on highly disputable ad hoc-assumptions. \nCobb and Cobb (1994, p. 266), e.g., value the consumption of a do-\nmestically produced barrel of oil or its equivalent in 1988 with \n75 US$, because that is the presumed cost of replacing the barrel with \nrenewable energy from biomass. For other years the replacement \ncosts are computed in retrospect and are forwarded under the as-\nsumption that they rise at the constant rate of 3% p.a. over time. If \nyou think 75 US$ is not much, compare it to the costs of importing a \nbarrel of oil from abroad which is about 20 US$. Or compare it to the \ncost of providing solar energy in a couple of decades when U.S. non-\n 14 \nrenewable energy resources are depleted which will certainly be \nmuch less than 75 US$ and is decreasing over time, not increasing, as \ntechnical progress makes renewable resource use cheaper. Also, \nCobb and Cobb (1994, p. 267) arbitrarily assume that the consump-\ntion of each barrel of oil or its equivalent causes accumulating envi-\nronmental damage costs of 0.50 US$ due to CO2-emissions and that \nthe production of each kilogram of CFC-11 and CFC-12 causes accu-\nmulating damage of 15 US$ (p. 273). Without the corrections for the \ndepletion of non-renewable resources, long-term environmental \ndamage and ozone depletion the ISEW in 1990 would be 83.5% \nhigher! These items are so large in magnitude that they dominate \nany other subtraction terms by one or two orders of magnitude. \nFigure 1 provides some sensitivity analyses for the U.S. ISEW. \nThere are six graphs, all are presented in per capita terms and con-\nstant 1972 US$ to relate to Cobb and Cobb (1994). For lack of data, \nonly the period 1970 to 1990 is covered. The lowest graph plots the \nISEW as presented in Cobb and Cobb (1994). \n \n<<< INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE >>> \n \nThe dotted line called US-ISEW2 uses a different methodology for \ncomputing the depletion of non-renewable resources and long-term \nenvironmental damage than Cobb and Cobb (1994). It is computed as \nfollows: Instead of arbitrary replacement costs for non-renewable \n 15 \nresources, US-ISEW2 subtracts total Hotelling rents from consump-\ntion expenditures. Total Hotelling rents are the product of price mi-\nnus average cost and resource depletion\/harvest6: (P-AC)*R. Theo-\nretical modelling (e.g. Hamilton 1994, 1996) shows that this is a rea-\nsonable correction term to account for resource depletion\/harvest, \nderived from a dynamic optimisation model. Data are taken from \nWorld Bank (1997a). Note that US-ISEW2 is covering more non-\nrenewable resources than Cobb and Cobb (1994) because it takes the \ndepletion of mineral resources into account as well, not only energy \nresources. It encompasses Hotelling rents from oil, natural gas, hard \ncoal, brown coal, bauxite, copper, iron, lead, nickel, zinc, phosphate, \ntin, gold, silver and forests7. As concerns long-term environmental \ndamage, US-ISEW2 values annual CO2-emissions at 20 US$ per met-\nric tonne carbon instead of arbitrarily assuming that each barrel of oil \nequivalent causes accumulating damage of 0.50$. Theoretical model-\nling (e.g. Hamilton 1994, 1996) again shows that this is a reasonable \ncorrection term to account for damage caused by CO2-emissions. The \n20 US$ is taken from Fankhauser (1995) and is often regarded as a \nconsensus estimate for the marginal cost of CO2-emissions. Data are \nagain taken from World Bank (1997a). Since marginal costs are used, \nthe damage costs are not accumulated over time. \nThe graph marked by the small triangles called US-ISEW3 is like \nUS-ISEW2, but with the further change that consumption expendi-\ntures are not weighted with an index of distribution inequality. It is \n 16 \napparent from the graphs that US-ISEW2 and even more so US-\nISEW3 are not only much higher than US-ISEW, but also follow the \nshape of US-GNP (per capita GNP, the graph marked with squares) \nrather closely. Instead of declining slightly over time as US-ISEW \ndoes, both US-ISEW2 and US-ISEW3 increase over time. \nHence, changing two sensitive parameters in Cobb and Cobb\u2019s \n(1994) methodology completely changes the presented picture about \nthe changes in welfare and sustainability. US-ISEW2 is certainly to be \npreferred to US-ISEW on theoretical grounds since its correction \nterms for resource depletion and environmental damage are derived \nfrom modelling and not arbitrarily chosen. Whether US-ISEW3 \nshould be preferred to US-ISEW2 depends on how you value distri-\nbution inequality. \nBoth US-ISEW2 and US-ISEW3 are still below US-GNP. This is \nbecause of the 14 items Cobb and Cobb (1994) subtract from personal \nconsumption expenditures, I have only changed one (ISEW2) or two \n(ISEW3), respectively. Yet another criticism is that the ISEWs are \nconstructed in a way that prompts one to suspect that their very aim \nis to show that welfare is lower than GNP and has risen much more \nslowly than indicated by GNP or has even fallen \u2014 e.g. by excluding \ninvestment into human capital and technical progress from their \nmeasurement (Eisner 1994, Atkinson 1995). Another correction that \ncould be undertaken and would likely raise the ISEW considerably is \nadjusting for improved quality of consumer goods over time. \n 17 \nAs concerns investment into human capital, Cobb and Cobb \n(1994, p. 53) exclude most expenditures for education because they \nbelieve that education \u201econtributes little to productivity\u201c and should \nhence not be counted as investment. On the other hand, Cobb and \nCobb believe that education should not count as consumption either \nsince \u201emost schooling appears to be defensive. In other words, peo-\nple attend school because others are in school and the failure to at-\ntend would mean falling behind in the competition for diplomas or \ndegrees that confer higher incomes on their recipients.\u201c As a conse-\nquence, only one-half of post-secondary education is counted as pure \nconsumption (Cobb and Cobb 1994, p. 54). \nThat education contributes little to productivity is at odds with \nmost studies of the determinants of long-run growth (World Bank \n1995, p. 62) which usually hold that \u201ehuman capital is the most criti-\ncal factor of production\u201c (Eisner 1994, p. 99). In the graph with the \nsmall crosses called US-ISEW4 in figure 1, education expenditures \nhave therefore been fully added to US-ISEW38. As can be seen in \ncomparison to US-ISEW2, the level of welfare and sustainability is \nconsiderably higher with the inclusion of education expenditures. \nAs concerns technical progress, Weitzman and L\u00f6fgren (1997) \nhave estimated the upward-correction to an indicator of sustainabil-\nity due to expected future technical progress. For the U.S. they esti-\nmate that sustainable income in 1987 is about 40% higher than GNP. \nThe exact magnitude of this estimate is dependent on a series of cru-\n 18 \ncial assumptions (see Weitzman and L\u00f6fgren 1997) and should not be \ngiven too much credit. More for illustrative purposes therefore, I \nhave simply assumed that the estimate is correct and of the same \nmagnitude for the rest of the period 1970 to 1990. The upper graph in \nfigure 1 with the black diamonds called US-ISEW5 plots the graph \nUS-ISEW4 augmented by 40%. For every year, US-ISEW5 lies above \nUS-GNP and would thus signal a higher achievement of sustainabil-\nity. \nFigure 2 provides an analogous analysis for the UK ISEW. All \ngraphs are again in per capita terms, but constant 1990 pounds Ster-\nling. The lowest graph plots the ISEW as presented in Jackson et al. \n(1997). The graph with the squares represents GDP. All other graphs \nare computed analogous to the analysis for the U.S. For simplicity \nand lack of a different data it is assumed that the upward correction \nfactor for technical progress is also 40%. The conclusions for this sen-\nsitivity analysis are quite similar: UK-ISEW2, UK-ISEW3 and UK-\nISEW4 move rather close with UK-GDP. There is a growing gap be-\ntween these modified ISEWs and the original UK-ISEW of Jackson et \nal. (1997). Again more for illustrative purposes, UK-ISEW5 takes ac-\ncount of the beneficial effects of technical progress which raises UK-\nISEW4 by 40% and lies above UK-GDP in every year. \n \n<<<< INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE >>> \n \n 19 \nTo conclude, with different assumptions about weighting of the \nincome distribution, the corrections for the depletion of non-\nrenewable resources and long-term environmental damage and the \ninclusion of the positive effects of human capital formation and tech-\nnical progress, one gets a completely different picture of a society\u2019s \nwelfare and achievement of sustainability. \n \nGNP\/GDP IS NOT AN INDICATOR OF WELFARE \nSometimes one gets the impression, however, that the construc-\ntors of ISEW-measures are not bothered very much by the subjectiv-\nity of the numbers they produce, as becomes clear in the following \nquotation taken from Cobb and Cobb (1994, p. 252): \u201eThe point is \nrather that when the GNP functions politically as a welfare measure, \nit should not be allowed to masquerade as a measure that is some-\nhow more objective than alternative ways of determining well-\nbeing.\u201c \nIt has to be conceded that Herman Daly, one of the first propo-\nnents of an ISEW, is aware of the many criticisms that can be raised \nagainst the ISEW. At the same time, however, he claims that it is a \nmuch better indicator of welfare and sustainability than GNP and is \nthus justified: \u201eOf course we had to make many arbitrary judge-\nments, but in our opinion no more arbitrary than those made in \nstandard GNP accounting \u2014 in fact less so. (...) We have no illusions \nthat our index is really an accurate measure of sustainable economic \n 20 \nwelfare... We did not offer the ISEW as the proper goal of economic \npolicy \u2014 it too has flaws. If GNP were a cigarette, then the ISEW \nwould be that cigarette with a charcoal filter.\u201c (Daly 1996, p. 97f.). \nSimilarly, Stockhammer et al. (1997, p. 33) argue that \u201ethe ISEW \nseems qualified to kick GDP from the throne as leading indicator for \neconomic policy\u201c while acknowledging that \u201eit is not ready to usurp \nthat throne\u201c. \nThe proponents of an ISEW rightly argue that GNP rests on \nhighly artificial and dubious assumptions as well, e.g. in valuing \npublic services at factor costs and ignoring household labour. And it \nis definitely a very bad indicator of welfare, especially in an inter-\ntemporal context encompassing future generations9. It takes little \naccount of the contribution of natural capital to economic activity \nand welfare and of the reverse impact of the economy on the envi-\nronment. Sometimes it is directly misleading as an indicator of wel-\nfare, e.g. when higher expenditures for the clean-up of rising pollu-\ntion are counted as an increase in GNP. The same holds true when \nthe liquidation of a capital stock, be it natural or not, is counted as an \naddition to value although capital consumption will eventually lead \nto economic decline. Also, it makes no attempt whatsoever to value \nenvironmental externalities. This is to be conceded. \nBut it has to be kept in mind that GNP\/GDP was never supposed \nto be an indicator of welfare and that it fulfils quite well the function \nit was supposed to accomplish when it was established after the Sec-\n 21 \nond World War: To provide an indicator for macroeconomic stabili-\nsation policy of the economic activity in a country (Hamilton et al. \n1994, p 7), i.e. an indicator of the total output produced by the econ-\nomy10. The revised system of national accounts states this with un-\nambiguous clarity: \u201eNeither gross nor net domestic product is a \nmeasure of welfare. Domestic product is an indicator of overall pro-\nduction activity\u201c (United Nations 1993, p. 41). And \u201etotal welfare \ncould fall even though GDP could increase in volume terms\u201c (ibid., \np. 14). \nIt was not the economists, but the politicians and the journalists \nwho interpreted GNP wrongly as an indicator of welfare. To be cor-\nrect, there was some debate among economists by the time the na-\ntional accounts were built up, but as Cobb and Cobb (1994, p. 20) \nadmit, \u201ethose who wanted to measure production won out over \nthose who believed that the national accounts should measure wel-\nfare\u201c. That is not to say that economists are completely innocent as \nconcerns the misinterpretation of GNP. Although they have usually \nnot supported the misinterpretation of GNP as a welfare indicator, it \nis true that they are devoted to provide measures against a downfall \nin GNP or, better, for triggering higher growth in GNP11. Also, in \ndealing with complex issues such as global warming, they occasion-\nally equate welfare with consumption growth which is represented \nby GNP (see, for example, Nordhaus 1991). In this respect, Cobb and \nCobb (1994, p. 250) are right in saying that \u201eas long as GNP is treated \n 22 \nby economists as the \u2018central framework\u2019 (...), political leaders and \nthe media will continue to view the GNP as a measure of welfare.\u201c \nBut what should the ensuing conclusion be? My argument is that it \nwould be a mistake to conclude that we are in need of an alternative \nsingle indicator of welfare and sustainability. This reasoning is \nspelled out in detail in the concluding section. Let us first look at an-\nother criticism of the ISEW, however. \n \nMETHODOLOGICAL INCONSISTENCIES \nThe authors of ISEWs commit the mistake of methodological in-\nconsistency in two respects: \n \n1) Contrary to what their authors think, the ISEW can not at the \nsame time function both as an indicator of current welfare and an \nindicator of sustainability, i.e. the capacity to provide non-declining \nwelfare over time. This is because the ISEW consists or should ideally \nconsist of items that should only be included in an indicator of cur-\nrent welfare or only in an indicator of sustainability. I have argued \nalready that while distributional inequality might be important for \ncurrent welfare, its link to sustainability is rather weak. Another ex-\nample for an item that should ideally be included in a welfare meas-\nure but not in an indicator of sustainability is leisure time. The ISEWs \nusually neglect the valuation of leisure time because doing so \n\u201ewould so totally swamp all other figures in such an index as to \n 23 \nmake every other aspect of welfare trivial by comparison\u201c (Cobb and \nCobb 1994, p. 275) \u2013 at least if leisure time is valued by an average \nwage rate, as is commonly done. Cobb and Cobb (1994, p. 275) real-\nise, however, that there \u201eis no particular reason within economic \ntheory\u201c for not including leisure time in a welfare indicator. But the \nvaluation of leisure time has no direct link whatsoever to sustainabil-\nity. An increase in the wage rate or a decrease in working hours \nwould raise the valuation of leisure time, but would not increase the \ncapacity to provide future welfare. \nReversely, there are many items that are relevant for a sustain-\nability but not for a welfare indicator. The depletion of non-\nrenewable resources and long-term environmental damage due to \nCO2-emissions, while diminishing sustainability, does not affect cur-\nrent welfare. The same holds true for expected technical progress. \nThe lesson is that one needs at least two indicators to measure \ntwo related, but distinct entities. Doing otherwise leads to methodo-\nlogical inconsistencies. \n \n2) The ISEW does not fulfil the objective it was originally con-\nstructed for. It has originally been proposed by \u2018ecological econo-\nmists\u2019 who are in favour of a \u2018strong\u2019 version of sustainability (Daly \n1992, 1996; Daly and Cobb 1989). Strong sustainability has been de-\nveloped as an opposing critique to \u2018weak sustainability\u2019 which as-\nsumes that natural capital is perfectly substitutable through other \n 24 \nforms of capital (Solow 1974, 1993a,b; Hartwick 1977, 1990). Weak \nsustainability requires keeping the aggregate total value of man-\nmade capital and natural capital at least constant to ensure non-\ndeclining welfare over time. Natural capital can be safely run down \nas long as enough other forms of capital are built up in exchange. \nStrong sustainability instead calls for keeping both the aggregate to-\ntal value of man-made, natural and other forms of capital and the \ntotal value of natural capital itself at least constant. \nThe proponents of strong sustainability have postulated some \nmanagement rules as a kind of rule of thumb to put their concept \ninto practice. Those rules are: \n \n\u2022 Use renewable resources such that its stock does not deteriorate. \nThat is: Harvest at maximum the maximum sustainable yield. \n\u2022 Decrease the use of non-renewable resources as far as possible and \nreplace their use with renewable resources (subject to the first rule, \nof course). \n\u2022 Maximise the efficiency of resource use and the recycling of re-\nsources. \n\u2022 Use the environment as a sink for pollution such that its natural \nabsorptive capacity does not deteriorate over time. \n \nStrictly speaking, as the management rules make clear, proponents of \nstrong sustainability want even more than keeping the total value of \n 25 \nnatural capital at least constant. What they want, in effect, is keeping \nthe total value of three sub-categories of natural capital constant: first \nthe aggregate of renewable resources, second the aggregate of re-\nnewable and non-renewable resources and third the aggregate of \npollution-absorptive-capacity. \nWhat is really surprising, however, is that the ISEW does not ex-\nplicitly distinguish sub-indices for different forms of total capital (e.g. \nman-made and natural capital) and different forms of natural capital \n(e.g. renewable and non-renewable resources), but eventually com-\nputes one overall index only. This meshing together of values from \nnatural and other forms of capital amounts to a conceptual break \nsince the heart of the concept of strong sustainability demands that \nnatural capital itself and even sub-categories of natural capital are \nheld constant. Ironically, the ISEW does not measure strong sustain-\nability, but weak sustainability at best since it assumes perfect substi-\ntutability among different forms of capital12! \n \nCONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \nFor policy purposes concerning welfare and sustainability it would \nbe important to have relevant and reliable indicators. Unfortunately, \nthe weaknesses of the foundations on which the ISEW rest discredits \nits policy relevance. \nAs Thage (1989, p. 319 and 329) observes, even the NNP, which \nsubtracts depreciation of man-made capital from GNP and is there-\n 26 \nfore closer to a welfare concept than GNP, is hardly used nationally \nor internationally due to the uncertainty about the estimates of de-\npreciation of man-made capital. For most developing countries no \nNNP-figures are available at all. Instead, the GNP (that is: without \ndepreciation of man-made capital) is used widely, even in contexts \nwhere use of NNP would theoretically be appropriate, e.g. in studies \nof value addition within industries. Thage concludes that adding fur-\nther correction terms to arrive at an indicator of welfare would be \npolitically irrelevant: \u201eNobody would pay any attention if a further \nreduction of this concept was made\u201c (Thage 1989, p. 329). This might \nbe too strong a conclusion, but doubts remain about the policy rele-\nvance of an ISEW-measure that necessarily rests on arbitrary as-\nsumptions and can be shown to be invalid as a reliable indicator for \nwelfare and sustainability. \nDaly (1996, p. 115) acknowledges the difficulties in constructing a \nbetter indicator of welfare, but sees the ISEW justified by preferring \n\u201eeven the poorest approximation to the correct concept\u201c to \u201ean accu-\nrate approximation to an irrelevant or erroneous concept\u201c while at \nthe same time conceding that \u201ethe mere existence of any numerical \nindex of welfare is a standing invitation to the fallacy of misplaced \nconcreteness\u201c (ibid. p. 98). Similarly, Sheng (1995, p. 10f.) in a study \nfor the World Wide Fund for Nature calls for integrating \u201eenviron-\nmental ad resource values into the core\u201c of the current system of na-\n 27 \ntional accounts until the system itself together with \u201eits indicators \nsuch as GDP are completely abolished\u201c. \nRichter (1993, p. 308), on the contrary, suggests that instead of \nconstructing a dubious alternative welfare indicator all activities \nshould be devoted to facilitate the proper interpretation of GNP. Per-\nsonally, I doubt whether one could succeed in preventing policy-\nmakers and the general public from misusing GNP as a welfare indi-\ncator. Now, that the welfare interpretation of GNP has become abso-\nlute folklore and a common place it might be too late to start warning \nagainst a misinterpretation of GNP. But that is not an argument in \nfavour of constructing another measure that requires even more \ncarefulness in interpretation. Richter (1993, p. 309) is right in arguing \nthat \u201eif national accountants have failed to inform decision makers \nand the broad public about the scope and limits of the indicators they \nprovide, can they really hope that the users will avoid the crucial \nproblems of misinterpretation in the case of an intellectually much \nmore demanding expanded system which comprises observed facts \nand sophisticated model results?\u201c. \nThe problem with the ISEW is not so much the imperfections of \nits components \u2014 in some way or other every social indicator is im-\nperfect. The problem rather is that it promises to measure something, \nnamely current welfare and sustainability, that cannot reliably be \nmeasured in one indicator, because hugely differing measures are \nequally plausible or, for that matter, implausible in methodology and \n 28 \nresults. Therefore, the ISEW cannot even serve as a reasonably good \nfirst order approximation for measuring current welfare and sustain-\nability. \nI suspect that the reason why so much effort is put into attempts \nto measure an ISEW is an understandable but misplaced desire to \narrive at a single number and at a clear-cut indicator for current wel-\nfare and sustainability. With appropriate assumptions one can al-\nways produce some figures. In doing so, researchers fall into the trap \nof misplaced concreteness: their desire for a single clear-cut indicator \nis so strong that, consciously or not, they repress the insurmounting \nproblems of arriving at the \u2018correct\u2019, and not just any, number. They \nignore that current welfare and sustainability are entities much too \ncomplex that they could be dealt with by a single indicator. As \nCommon (1993, p. 10f.) rightly notes: \u201eIndeed, it could be argued \nthat the pursuit of such a measure is counterproductive, in so far as it \nmis-represents the nature of the sustainability problem.\u201c Richter \n(1994, p. 218) therefore calls attempts to construct alternative welfare \nindicators futile \u201eshadow boxing\u201c that waste scarce time and re-\nsources. \nIn the end, sticking to GNP and warning against misinterpreting it as \nan indicator of welfare for me seems to be the best conclusion one \ncan draw. That is not to say that further research and effort should \nnot be undertaken to improve existing and develop new indicators of \nwelfare. A whole set of indicators are existent already, many of \n 29 \nwhich have been published and extensively discussed in this journal. \nWhat should be abolished, however, is the misplaced and misleading \nbelief that there can be one single indicator that measures both cur-\nrent welfare and sustainability and commands enough general \nagreement to brush away GNP in the attention of policy makers and \nthe public. Carson and Young (1994, p. 112) \u2014 one the Director, the \nother Chief Statistician of the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the \nU.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 are right in arguing that \u201ea single-\ndimension aggregate measure of sustainable welfare will be of little \ndirect use in guiding, shaping, or choosing among government poli-\ncies because the factors determining welfare cannot be reduced and \ncombined into a single measure that would command widespread \nagreement and acceptance. In this respect, a measure of welfare dif-\nfers from the GNP.\u201c \nAs concerns the welfare impact of environmental changes, even \none of the major pioneers of deriving a theoretically correct measure \nof sustainability admits that \u201ewe will have to continue relying on \nphysical and other special indicators to a large extent in order to \njudge the performance of the economy with respect to the use of en-\nvironmental resources\u201c (M\u00e4ler 1991, p. 1). As concerns sustainability, \nRobert Solow (1993b, p. 180), on whose work the concept of weak \nsustainability is based upon, realises that \u201esustainability is an essen-\ntially vague concept, and it would be wrong to think of it as being \nprecise, or even capable of being made precise. It is therefore proba-\n 30 \nbly not in any clear way an exact guide to policy\u201c. This conclusion is \nshared by Norgaard (1994, p. 22) who states that \u201eit is impossible to \ndefine sustainable development in an operational manner in the de-\ntail and with the level of control presumed in the logic of moder-\nnity\u201c, and by Folke and Kaberger (1991, p. 289) who state that \u201eit is \nnot meaningful to measure the absolute sustainability of a society at \nany point of time\u201c. \n \n 31 \nREFERENCES \nAtkinson, A.B.: 1983, The Economics of Inequality (Oxford Univer-\nsity Press, Oxford). \nAtkinson, Giles: 1995, Measuring Sustainable Economic Welfare: A \nCritique of the UK ISEW, Working Paper GEC 95-08 (Centre for \nSocial and Economic Research on the Global Environment, \nNorwich and London). \nBeckerman, Wilfred: 1995, Small is Stupid \u2014 Blowing the Whistle on \nthe Greens (Duckwort: London). \nCarson, Carol S. and Allan H.

Whenever I speak of GNP in the following, \nstrictly speaking it should read GNP\/GDP. \n2 For an overview of early attempts to provide a monetary welfare indicator see \nEisner (1988). \n3 The updated UK-study, e.g., made frontpage headline news (Jackson et al. 1997, \nforeword). \n4 Man-made capital here means produced capital as defined in the conventional \nsystem of national accounts. \n5 The idea behind letting the costs accumulate over time is as follows: Cobb and \nCobb (1994, p. 74)  \u201eimagined that a tax or rent of $0.50 per barrel-equivalent had \nbeen levied on all non-renewable energy consumed during that period and set \naside to accumulate in a non-interest-bearing account (...). That account might be \nthought of as a fund available to compensate future generations for the long-term \ndamage (...).\u201c \n6 Strictly speaking, Hotelling rents are defined in terms of marginal costs. The more \nreadily available average costs are used as a proxy to marginal costs. Note that the \nvalue of resource depletion is higher with average than with marginal costs which \ngives the US-ISEW2 graph a downward bias. \n7 For more detail on the data see World Bank (1997b) and Kunte et al. (1997). \n8 Counting all current education expenditures (including teachers\u2019 salaries, expen-\nditures on textbooks etc.) as contributions towards increasing the stock of human \ncapital is likely to overestimate this item somewhat. Hence, the US-ISEW4 graph is \nsomewhat biased upwards. \n9 However, Daly\u2019s (1996, p. 112) claim that GNP bears no closer relation to welfare \nthan the stock of gold bullion did in the age of mercantilism is vastly overdrawn. \nAs Beckerman (1995, p. 108f.) rightly retorts: If this was true, why do people almost \nalways migrate towards countries with a higher GNP and rarely vice versa? Also, \nas Dasgupta (1990) and Dasgupta and Weale (1992) show, at least in poor countries \nGNP is highly correlated with basic indicators of the quality of life such as life ex-\npectancy, infant mortality, adult literacy and indices of political and civil rights. \n10 It has to be conceded, however, that it does so rather imperfectly in developing \ncountries where, often, much of the economic activity in the so-called informal \n 39 \n                                                                                                                            \nsectors is not taken into account. Also, mainly only marketed economic activity is \nincluded since domestic and personal services produced and consumed by mem-\nbers of the same household or provided without payment are omitted In addition, \neconomic activity in the black market is by its very nature not included in \nGNP\/GDP. \n11 Note, however, that this concern can be justified by the close link between \nchanges in GNP and government revenue, employment etc., i.e. without recourse \nto welfare. \n12 Jackson and Marks (1994, p. 35), the authors of the early UK-study, acknowledge \nthe limitedness of the index they compute: \u201eOn the other hand, a level of welfare \nwhich burdens future generations with a polluted environment, depleted re-\nsources, and social disintegration, cannot be said to be sustainable, even if it is \nmeasured at a lower value than the wealth that created it. (..) It is not our conten-\ntion therefore that the UK-ISEW reflects a level of welfare intended to ensure the \nfuture sustainability of the economic and social system. (...) Rather, we suggest that \nthe ISEW should be regarded only as a de minimus indicator of the sustainability \nor unsustainability of past actions, and not as any kind of insurance policy against \nthe future.\u201c \n"}
