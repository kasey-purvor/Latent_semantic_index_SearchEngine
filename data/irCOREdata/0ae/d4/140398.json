Introduction8\nLack of adequate sanitation threatens the life of billions of people in the poor regions of the world.9\nTogether with access to a safe water supply, a hygienic means of excreta disposal counts amongst the10\nmost basic human needs. Failure to meet this need not only weakens a population\u2019s health, it also impacts11\nthe economy and the natural environment, jeopardising all attempts of a society to climb up the ladder of12\ndevelopment (UNDP 2006). The last 50 years saw a great deal of evolution in the policies guiding water13\nsupply and sanitation (watsan) development. Initially, these matters were mainly tackled by \u2018traditional14\nengineers\u2019 and economic experts and were viewed as the mere provision of infrastructures and services to15\nthe population by the public authorities (Black 1998). In the early 80s, the repeated failure of this top-16\ndown, supply-driven, \u2018technologist\u2019 model in the rural sector encouraged the development of alternative17\nmodels based on demand-driven, participatory approaches putting people at the centre of the development18\nprocess (EAWAG 2005, Schouten and Moriarty 2003, Black 1998). In urban contexts, a comparable yet19\nmore recent awareness is also tangible. The framework Sanitation 21, developed by the International20\nWater Association, advocate a shift from a Victorian era perspective of sanitation to a more complex21\napproach more concerned with the users\u2019 interests and stakeholders capacities (IWA 2010). Indeed,22\naccording to this leading actor in the sector, \u2018the conventional approaches to sanitation planning and23\ndesign seem to fail with depressing regularity\u2019 (IWA 2006). In the bottom-up approaches to rural watsan24\ndevelopment, techno-economic aspects become parts of a multidimensional issue comprising social and25\ncultural factors (Liebler 1994). The popularity of such approaches has grown considerably during the last26\ndecades (Schouten 2003, Lockwood 2004) and they are now increasingly advocated by national and27\ninternational donor organisations. Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) approach, for instance, was28\nlaunched in the late 1990s and achieved 100% sanitation coverage in over 400 Bangladeshi villages (Kar29\n2003). It has proven to be an effective and sustainable solution in many African countries where it is now30\n3actively promoted by large NGOs such as Plan International, WaterAid, and Islamic Relief, as well as the1\nmultilateral donors UNICEF and the World Bank (Saha and Negussieb 2009). Household-Centred2\nEnvironmental Sanitation (HCES), promoted by the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and3\nTechnology and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council is another recent example of4\npeople-focused, multidimensional approach to sanitation (EAWAG 2005).5\nGenerally speaking, this transition in the approaches advocated in the watsan sector involves much6\nconcern for integrative thinking, as noted by Robbins (2007) who described the emergence of \u2018reflexive\u20197\nwatsan engineers, with their characteristically more integrated and holistic view of socio-technical8\nsystems (Robbins 2007). Integrative thinking is on the agenda of most donor agencies, who recurrently9\nwarn of the shortcomings of fragmented approaches (BMZ 2009; DFID 2008, UNDP 2006). Part of this10\nfragmentation originates in the segmentation of the knowledge on sanitation into independent disciplines.11\nDespite the rise of cross-disciplinary specialities, such as environmental engineering or sanitary12\nengineering, an important disconnect remains among certain disciplines (eg. public-health,13\nsocial\/behavioural, economic\/political), which are essential to comprehend a complex issue such as14\nsanitation development (Batterman et al. 2009). This disciplinary segmentation of knowledge is projected15\nto a large extent on the institutional plane too, contributing to the splitting-up of the responsibility for16\nsanitation among a multitude of institutions, which Jenkins and Sugden (2006) have generically17\ndescribed: The Ministry of Water, historically in charge of water supply and sewer networks, has little18\nexpertise in on-site sanitation and much less in hygiene education. This is the ground of the Ministry of19\nHealth, ideally placed to address hygiene, water borne diseases and behavior change, but which20\nnonetheless lacks technical expertise in sanitation and budget for implementation. In decentralized states,21\nsanitation services can fall under the duty of the Ministry of Local Government. Local governments are22\nwell situated to assess the needs of their people but tend to lack skills for sanitation, and may not have23\nmuch political interest in the issue. The Ministry of Rural Development is generally involved in the24\ndevelopment of infrastructure at household and community level and the Ministry of Environment is25\nincreasingly concerned by the impact of lack of sanitation on surface and groundwater resources. In this26\ncontext, effective co-ordination is practically impossible and the further decentralization of27\nresponsibilities at regional, district, and city levels leads to a net result of \u2018tangled web of overlapping,28\nuncoordinated, unworkable policies, low budget allocations, low prioritization and lack of accountability\u201929\n(Jenkins and Sugden 2006). Fragmentation in the approach to sanitation development is thus increasingly30\n4regarded as a key obstacle by the international community, which increasingly advocates holistic1\napproaches as a remedy, as the following quotes demonstrate:2\n\u2018Interventions should be based on a holistic and systems-based approach [\u2026]\u2019 (SIDA, 2004).3\n\u2018UNESCO\u2019s International Hydrological Programme addresses the issue of sanitation in the broader4\ncontext of sustainable urban water management, by adopting a holistic approach [...]\u2019 (UNESCO 2007).5\n\u2018We thus advocate a holistic total sanitation approach [\u2026]\u2019 (SDC 2007).6\nThis paper describes the development of such a holistic approach chiefly designed to highlight the7\ninterconnectedness of all the factors (technical, economic, social, cultural, political etc.) influencing8\nsanitation development and thus to counterbalance the habit of fragmenting and tackling this issue9\nthrough independent disciplines. This case-study research, undertaken in Mexico, focused on three rural10\nand peri-urban communities. First, the methodology, which relies on qualitative methods of investigation11\nand incorporates conceptual mapping as a visual means of representation, is described. The results are12\nthen presented: the maps are generically described as well as common patterns detected amongst the case-13\nstudies. The overall approach is then critically evaluated. Its strengths and limitations, as well as its14\npractical usefulness are examined.15\n16\n2. Methodology17\nThe research design and the data collection process was pilot tested in Mexico and applied in situ in three18\ncase studies. Data analysis and the graphic presentation of the results as conceptual maps were carried out19\nin the UK.20\n2.1. Research design21\n2.1.1. Case study research22\nA systems approach was followed to comprehensively assess sanitation development in the school. The23\ncomponents of the system were defined as all the factors influencing sanitation development. The24\nmethodology had to allow for the identification components of diverse nature (e.g. technical, social,25\ncultural, institutional, economic...) and emphasise their interactions. Qualitative methods of investigations26\n5were found most suitable to encompass these various dimensions. A standard case-study research1\napproach was used in the three communities over a period of 14 months.2\n2.1.2. Sanitation in Mexico: situating the research in the macro context3\nMexico provides a rich and multifaceted context for this research. The country is deeply involved in a4\nmodernization process, which has economically benefited northern and central parts of the country5\nessentially, leaving the South in a comparatively severe level of poverty. The high rates of urbanisation6\nand demographic growth, respectively +26% and +21% during the period 1990-2005(CONAGUA 2008)7\nhave contributed to intensify groundwater overexploitation and contamination of all water resources, to8\nsuch an extent, that water was recently established as a national security issue (Presidencia de la9\nRepublica 2010). Regarding sanitation, the National Water Commission (CONAGUA), placed under the10\nauthority of the Ministry of Environment (SEMARNAT), indicates a steady progress in the provision of11\nservices. In 2008, 86.4% of the population was connected to the sewer system and around 40% of the12\ncollected wastewater (36% of the total effluent produced) was treated. A closer look to the data reveals13\nsevere problems in some regions: while the State of Nuevo Leon (Northern Mexico) processes 100% of14\nits wastewater, only 12.9% of the effluent produced in Mexico City\u2019s district ever reaches a treatment15\nplant. Most of it (53m3\/s) is pumped northbound to a neighboring State for agricultural reuse. The16\nsouthern states of Yucatan and Campeche only treat 2.1% and 3.8% of their wastewater. And as expected,17\npopulations living in rural areas, of particular interest in this research, have a less access to the sewer18\nsystem (62%) than in urban areas (94%) (CONAGUA 2009). These official data, however, do not capture19\nthe tough sanitary reality of an increasing portion of the population, which amasses in informal20\nsettlements of the peri-urban zones of large cities, and who often do not have statistical existence. Nor do21\nthey detail the sanitation alternatives used by the 38% of the rural population unserved by the sewer22\nsystem.23\nMexico presents other relevant features for this research on a holistic approach to sanitation development.24\nCONAGUA, the leading institution in the water sector, has traditionally addressed sanitation from a25\ntypically Victorian, technologist perspective (CONAGUA 2009). The institution, which was originally26\nfounded to develop irrigation infrastructures in the country, introduces itself as the \u2018heir of a great27\ntradition in hydraulics\u2019 (CONAGUA 2010). In spite of the decentralization, CONAGUA\u2019s maintains a28\nsignificant influence on the sector. In her research on capacity building in the Mexican water sector,29\nTortajada (2001) reports that the World Bank repeatedly pointed out that aside its considerable technical30\n6expertise, the Mexican water sector needed a stronger interdisciplinary expertise with better planning and1\nmanagement skills. According to her, holistic efforts involving the development of human resource in2\ndomains that are not purely engineering and the integration of these skills in multi-disciplinary and multi-3\nsectoral approaches are urgent. Multilateral institutions such as that of the Inter-American Development4\nBank (IDB) and the World Bank strongly foster such efforts by imposing certain conditionality to their5\nloans. For instance, the project \u2018Potable Water and Sanitation in Rural Areas II\u2019 approved in 20056\ncounted community participation and institutional strengthening as key components aside infrastructures7\n(IDB 2010).8\n2.1.3. System boundaries9\nThe research focused on sanitation development in small communities of less than 4000 inhabitants. First10\nof all, the identification of the external influences on systems of such scale is a much simpler and less11\ntime-consuming task than in a city. In addition, as described in the previous section, much of Mexico\u2019s12\nefforts in sanitation development now have to address the important gap between the sewered cities and13\nthe non-sewered, dispersed rural localities and informal peri-urban zones. The research was designed on14\nthe basis of three case studies (preceded by a pilot case study) to test the validity and robustness of the15\napproach against varying circumstances. The communities were selected on the basis of four criteria:16\npopulation size; sanitation infrastructures; economic and socio-cultural environments; institutional and17\npolitical background (see Table 1). Figure 1 shows the location of each case study. Ultimately, the case18\nstudies were chosen following the advice of respected informants (e.g. NGO members, researchers). One19\nof the case studies significantly differed from the others in that a primary school was chosen to form the20\nboundary of the system. The objective was to test the approach on a smaller scale and to evaluate its21\nrelevance in a context that has become much of a concern for the international community (UNESCO,22\nUNICEF, WHO, The World Bank 2005).23\nTable 1.

Location of the case-studies (Adapted from map of Mexico (CIA 2010))2\n3\nThe first five months of fieldwork preceding the first case study were spent testing the research design in4\nEl Copal, state of Guanajuato. Notably, data collection tools were evaluated and selected on the basis of5\nthe relevance and quantity of information they permitted to gather from various stakeholders. This pilot6\nphase was particularly useful to become more familiar with the people and institutions with a stake in7\ncommunity sanitation and with cultural features of Mexico.8\n2.2. Data collection tools9\nThe pool of data collection tools actually used in each case study is presented in Table 2. Qualitative10\ninterviewing in its various forms represented the core instrument of the data collection process. Literature11\n8review, which largely contributed to the baseline study of each site, also served during the analytical1\nphase to assess the relevance of generalizing observations from patterns common to several case studies.2\nTable 2.

In this case, A, an ex-leader of San Luis Beltran, a village in the rural-urban6\nfringe of Oaxaca City, explains the main reason why his community had always been opposed to the idea7\nof a sewer project. The sewer system was viewed as the doorway to urbanisation, with its gain and losses.8\nJ (interviewer): They were offering water in exchange for the right to carry the water across the9\nvillage to San Felipe and to Donaji, right [in exchange of sharing your spring]?10\nA (interviewee): Exactly, and for all the communities down the hill. And we said no, because they11\nwanted to contaminate our water [mix it with other water sources and chlorinate it], which comes12\nfrom the hill and is clean. Thank God we have it. So they said: \u2018we connect the water to the tank we're13\ngoing to make for you, and we'll give you water.\u2019 They were going to put in flow-meters; they were14\ngoing to incorporate us...15\nJ: Do you mean that they were going to make you dependent on...the city.16\n9A. Yes, on the city. So we refused...1\nJ: They were offering both things: water and the sewer system.2\nA: Exactly. So I was one of the pioneers to see that. [..] We don't want the [their] water, we've got3\nwater to survive, we don't need the sewer, we've got latrines. We're happy like that. [...] The other4\nthing is that they said that if they put in the sewer here, they would pave the road over the sewer. I tell5\nyou that the government does things its way, but they don't tell the people about the benefits and the6\ndrawbacks. But we're guilty, the people who govern and the population, for not realizing what the7\nprojects involves. Because I repeat: during the two terms of office previous to mine, they had offered8\nthe sewer system. And when they offered it to me, we refused for the same old reasons.9\nJ. Why is there such a strong willingness from the government to implement it?10\nA. It is to enclose us within the city. As municipal agencies and as villages, we've always opposed11\nourselves. But the government doesn't want us to remain a village, but a district\u202612\nJ. \u2026which can be managed...13\nA: Exactly! This is what happened with Dolores: it used to be a municipal agency, and it is not14\nanymore: it has become a district now. It lost its independence. It lost it!15\nSI2- A, community leader in 1990-199216\n17\nPictures were very useful to increase the validity and credibility of key concepts gathered through18\ninterviewing. The following picture shows the unfinished and abandoned construction of five cistern-19\ntoilets in the primary school Morelos. It portrays both the motivation of the parents to improve their20\nchildren\u2019s sanitary conditions at school, the lack of technical expertise of the parents\u2019 committee (indeed,21\nto operate, cistern toilets need a reliable source of piped water, which the school cannot provide). And in22\nparticular, it clearly describes the devastating influence of corruption in this group, as confirmed by23\nextracts of several interviews quoted here together with the picture:24\nX [interviewee] explained how they had been required to financially contribute (50 pesos) to build up25\nnew toilets at school and how \u2018the president [of the parents\u2019 committee] who was supposed to build26\nthe toilets stole the money' MI20 - X (pupil 's parent)27\n'In the committee last year, the president was a mason and the treasurer was contractor, and they28\nseized money. Furthermore, they asked every father two contributions of 50 pesos. [The treasurer29\n10\nthen] set up his own shop in the residential zone. He took his daughter out of the school and put her in1\nMineria [Mineria school] 'M127 - Y (teacher)2\n3\nFigure 2. The \u2018new\u2019 toilets of Morelos primary school.4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n2.3. Data analysis process12\n2.3.1. Data Coding13\nThe collected data were coded with the computer software QSR Nvivo (QSR International 1999). A two-14\nlevel classification was used, with the primary criteria based on scale (Community level, Neighbourhood-15\nRegional level, and Country level) and the secondary criteria based on disciplinary-like dimensions (e.g.16\neconomic, political, technical, socio-cultural, institutional). For each scale, a summaries grouped short17\nstatements describing direct or indirect influences on sanitation development. These propositions were18\nintentionally structured as causal relationships between several concepts, as required by the next phase of19\nthe analysis, involving conceptual mapping. For example:20\n\u2018Social cohesion hinders corruption, and promotes the participation of people in community21\ndevelopment.\u201922\n\u2018People first accepted the ecological toilets because they believed that they would never get23\naccess to a sewer system, because it was too expensive and the community leaders disapproved24\nthe use of this technology.\u201925\n11\n\u2018Paternalism leads people to accept everything the authorities offer them, without knowing the1\nuse they\u2019ll make of it. As a consequence, the ecological toilets were widely accepted, but some2\npeople use them as a storehouse or as a hen-house, and some just used the material to build3\nsomething else.\u20194\nFor each case study, the coding phase thus yields a collection of propositions featuring concepts5\nlinked by causal relationships. In distilled form, this information presents the complexity and6\ndiversity of the factors affecting sanitation development and implies a web of relationships amongst7\nthese factors.8\n2.3.2. Conceptual mapping9\nA means to make this complexity and interconnectedness tangible, easily accessible and of practical use10\nfor field practitioners and decision makers was sought in the field of information visualization. Research11\nin psychology and communications has shown that visual representation encourages synthesis by the12\nreceiver, while language typically requires analytical decomposition (Unnava & Burnkrant, 1991). They13\nare also particularly advantageous when the task involves - as in this research - illustrating relations,14\nidentifying patterns, presenting an overview and details, improve understanding and problem solving and15\ncommunicate different types of knowledge (Burkhard and Meier 2004). Conceptual mapping, also called16\nconcept mapping or causal loop diagram in the systems community, was the method chosen to bring out a17\nholistic visual representation of each case study system. It is particularly effective in capturing and18\nsharing experts\u2019 knowledge (Ca\u00f1as et al. 2005) as well as fostering processes of knowledge acquisition19\n(Tergan 2003) and memorizing (Burgess et al. 1992). In the watsan sector, this versatile technique has20\nalready been used to picture complex issues, such as the relationships between health, productivity,21\neducation and culture (Burkey 1993) or the linkages between road construction and the rise of diarrheal22\ndiseases in Ecuador (Batterman et al. 2009). Of much relevance for this research too, Schouten and23\nMoriarty (2003) developed a map presenting the requirements for sustainable community management of24\nrural watsan services. As in this research, the factors cover various dimensions of the problem (economic,25\ntechnical, legal, social) at different scales (country, region, community).26\nA conceptual map generically consists of a collection of concepts interrelated by links (usually causal). In27\nthis research, a map was created for each case study, made of concept-boxes related by positive or28\nnegative causal relationships. The concepts, which describe the factors deemed most significant in29\n12\nsanitation development, emerged from the review of the node summaries. For instance, in San Luis1\nBeltran case study, the node summary at community level includes the statement:2\n\u2018Two years have passed since the sewer system was built and it is not operational yet. As a3\nresult, many community members do not want to pay until the sewer is operational.4\nUnwillingness to pay hinders the sewer system defects from being fixed.\u20195\nOn the map, it translates into two concept-boxes and, in this case, a bi-directional causal link (positive6\nfeedback loop) (see Figure 3).7\nFigure 3. Two concept-boxes connected in a positive feedback loop.8\n9\nThe selection of the concepts was constrained by two imperatives:10\n\u2022 Revealing the complexity and the multidimensional nature of the issue without overloading the map,11\na typical tradeoff in the development of conceptual maps (Batterman et al. 2009; Burgess et al.12\n1992);13\n\u2022 Highlighting the uniqueness of each case study without neglecting macro factors (influences at14\nnational and regional scale).15\nCertain features were used to aid understanding and recall of map content: macro factors were placed on16\nthe edges of the maps when possible, and key concept-boxes (called \u2018nodal-factors\u2019) at the centre. To17\nfacilitate reading, criss-crossing between concept-links was minimized using the software Decision18\nExplorer (Banxia 2000). Also, a colour code differentiates concept-boxes (factors) according to the19\ndisciplines typically used to address them (i.e. grey for political factors, yellow for social factors, blue for20\neconomic factors, red for cultural factors, white for nodal-factors...).21\n2.4. Research validity and reflexivity22\n2.4.1. Validity criteria23\n13\nThe question of the validity of qualitative research has given rise to many different interpretations and1\ngenerated much debate. The researcher is considered as part of the experiment and his influence on the2\noutcome of the work cannot be eliminated (Neuman 1997). The quest for absolute objectivity is thus3\nfutile. Yet, qualitative research still needs to demonstrate a scientific validity, which can be done by4\ncomplying with some of the key validity criteria synthesised by Whittemore et al. (2001):5\n\u2022 Primary criteria: integrity, authenticity, credibility and criticality6\n\u2022 Secondary criteria: explicitness, thoroughness, creativity, vividness, congruence7\nCredibility refers to the conscious effort to establish confidence in an accurate interpretation of the8\nmeaning of the data (Whittemore et al. 2001). In this respect, transparency was sought throughout the9\nresearch process, making available all the gathered data, the raw interview transcripts, as well as the10\ndetails of coding. Authenticity relates to the capacity of a research to reflect the meanings and experiences11\nthat are lived and perceived by participants. Triangulation and the pursuit of interviews on a given topic12\nuntil the \u2018point of theoretical saturation\u2019 (Glaser and Strauss 1967) were means to meet this criterion. The13\nlog sections of every interview transcript, which compile information on the context of the interview (date14\n& time, setting, general feeling, personal comments, awareness of and suspension of personal15\nassumptions) and specify the bit(s) of the interview deliberately left out, contribute to satisfy the integrity16\ncriterion. Criticality was addressed through a reflexive assessment of the work, which is examined in the17\nfollowing section. The research design, process and methodological decisions were made very explicit,18\nconferring auditability to the work and much vividness was provided by detailed and faithful descriptions.19\nCongruence between the study aim, the approach and the results was also established.20\n2.4.1. A reflexive approach21\nAccording to Marshall (1990), reflexivity and critical analysis of all aspects of the investigation add to the22\nvalidity of qualitative research. Willig (2001) makes a distinction between personal and epistemological23\nreflexivity. Personal reflexivity questions how \u2018our own values, experiences, interests, beliefs, political24\ncommitments, wider aims in life and social identities have shaped the research [...] [and] how the research25\nmay have affected and possibly changed us, as people and as researchers\u2019 (Willig 2001). \u2018Epistemological26\nreflexivity\u2019 is about examining the implications of the research question and the methods used on the27\noutcome of the research. The research transformed the understanding of sanitation development of the28\nmain author, which quickly shifted from a \u2018traditional\u2019 towards a \u2018reflexive\u2019 engineer\u2019s perspective,29\n14\nwhereby social and cultural issues became as important as the technical and economic concerns,1\nultimately providing an insight into the social construction of reality. The research project originally2\nfocused on technological, environmental and economic dimensions mainly. Social and cultural3\ndimensions had been barely considered. The confrontation with the field reality quickly led to correct this4\noversight. Shadow socio-cultural, institutional or political factors, which generally receive too little5\nattention from engineers, appeared to play a significant role in the rather frequent failures of sanitation6\nsystems in Mexico. The urge to know more about all the factors which influence sanitation development7\nand how they interact is what motivated this research.8\nThis early shift in the framing of the problem shaped the methodology. The social and cultural9\ndimensions being recognised as part of the problem, qualitative methods of research became most10\nrelevant. Literature review in the fields of qualitative research, contemporary sociology and cultural11\nstudies had an interpretive influence on the research. Epistemological reflexivity went as far as examining12\nbasic assumptions behind this research, such as the meaning attached to sanitation development. Opinions13\nvary. Foucauldians and neo-Marxist perspectives challenging the conventional view were examined. In14\nthis research sanitation was regarded as a decisive factor of progress, representing one of the fundamental15\nsteps of the ladder of development. Arguably, open-air defecation does not necessarily represent a16\nhindrance in societies that form small communities scattered in a natural setting. However it increasingly17\nposes health, security and environmental issues as data clearly suggest in the case of Mexico.18\n19\n3. Results20\n3.1. Case study conceptual maps21\nFor each case study, the graphical outputs are: an overall map, several sub-maps and connection-groups.22\nThe overall map (see Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6) is a large and dense graphical representation23\ncounting up to 70 concept-boxes, which reveals the complexity of the sanitation issue and the24\ninterconnectedness of the factors affecting it. Sub-maps and connection-groups are provided to facilitate25\nthe exploration of the different regions of the map. The sub-maps are sectors of the overall map26\ncomprising around 15 concepts (Figure 7). Their slight overlap ensures no information is lost in this27\nclose-up process. Connection-groups are small sets of 2 to 5 concepts (see Figure 8). Thorough28\nexplanations, substantiated by vivid field data (interview quotes, literature review, pictures etc.)29\n15\naccompany them. In this paper the authors present critical findings drawn from the analysis of the overall1\nmaps. These results, which consist in general patterns, are described and illustrated with examples from2\ncase-studies.3\nFigure 4: Overall map - El Mirador\u2019s Primary School case study4\nFigure 5: Overall map \u2013 San Luis Beltran case study5\nFigure 6: Overall map \u2013 Tepezal\u00e1 case study6\nFigure 7: Sub-map 1- El Mirador\u2019s primary school7\nFigure 8: Connection groups8\n3.2. General patterns9\nThe overall maps depict the uniqueness of each case-study, reflecting the diversity of the local conditions10\nmet across case studies. However, common patterns were also found, which were examined and11\ncompared with the existing literature to establish whether generalizations could be drawn. For practical12\nreasons, these patterns were arranged in four themes: cultural, political, demographic and economical13\npatterns.14\n3.2.1. \u2018Cultural\u2019 patterns: corruption, duplicity, resignation...15\nBribery, corruption, and machismo were identified as significant influences on the development of16\nsanitation in each and every case study. Whether occurring in the higher spheres of government or at local17\nlevel, fraud was found to affect the sustainable development of sanitary conditions. As The Water18\nIntegrity Network (WIN) demonstrated, corruption is widespread in the watsan sector. It affects all19\ncountries, both private and public services, and concerns policy design, budget allocation, contract20\nawarding, billing systems, water connection fees (WIN 2010). Massive corruption is often cited as a21\nmajor cause of Mexico\u00b4s catastrophic wastewater treatment experience (Dasso 2008). Although its22\nintensity may be far greater on large-scale project involving centralised sanitation infrastructure, the23\nresearch also revealed the presence of corruption in projects involving decentralised systems. In San Luis24\nBeltran case study, the reputation of the state sanitation program supporting the construction of ecological25\ntoilets in rural areas was stained by massive government frauds. The bribery that granted exclusivity of26\nthe ecological toilet seats contract to a single firm of Mexico City ruined the community workshop.27\nSmall-scale community projects are not immune to corruption either. Despite its lesser intensity in these28\n16\ncontexts, its effects are nonetheless economically and emotionally equally devastating for the population.1\nIn El Mirador, for instance, recurrent frauds in the parents\u2019 committee largely contributed to bring2\nsanitation development to a standstill. Additionally, at community level, the groundwater supply project3\nwas jeopardised by the fraud involving one member of the community council and the borehole drilling4\ncompany.5\nDuplicitous attitudes of officials from local, municipal and state governments were also a major hurdle to6\nthe development of sanitation projects. Likewise, the understandable passivity and resignation of people7\nwitnessing dishonest deeds or enduring harsh conditions of life, as well as a general atmosphere of8\nmistrust in the three communities investigated affected sanitation development. Research on these cultural9\nfeatures revealed them as characteristic of Mexico (Paz 1985; Schneider and Silverman 1997;10\nOppenheimer 1996). It also indicated that they can hardly be examined as separate aspects because they11\nstem from a common set of symbolic representations, a cultural heritage deeply ingrained in the minds of12\nthe Mexican people. These factors are likely to be present and affecting sanitation development, to13\nvarying degrees, in most parts of the country.14\n3.2.2. Economic patterns15\nThe general state of poverty of people in Tepezal\u00e1, El Mirador, and San Luis Beltran certainly impedes to16\nsome degree their capacity to improve their sanitary conditions. It partly explains why many dwellers use17\ninadequate pit-latrines or defecate in the open-air. However, excessive generalisations of the economic18\nfeatures common to the case studies would be misleading. Economic activity and poverty are19\nheterogeneous throughout Mexico. The three case studies are in no way representative of the country20\nsituation: El Mirador and San Luis Beltran are located in the state of Oaxaca, one of the poorest regions21\nof Mexico, where development is highly dependent on federal funds. In 2008, a long awaited wastewater22\ntreatment plant was inaugurated in Oaxaca. It has a capacity to treat all the effluent of Oaxaca City and23\nthe 12 surrounding municipalities, which comprise the small communities of El Mirador and San Luis24\nBeltran. Lack of state and municipal financial resources was clearly one of the main reasons delaying the25\nconstruction of this much-needed treatment plant. The increased economic support of the federal26\ngovernment made it possible. Notably, as part of the National Fund of Wastewater Treatment, the27\ngovernment actually subsidies the operation of the wastewater plant at up to 0.50$MN per cubic meter,28\nwhich in the case of Oaxaca represents 83% of the operation cost (Presidencia de la Republica 2008). As29\nfor Tepezal\u00e1, its decrepitude and low capacity for investment (cf. section 3.2.4) starkly contrasts with the30\n17\nrelative wealth of Aguascalientes State. It remains that the impact of NAFTA (North American Free1\nTrade Agreements) on the agricultural sector and the low fiscal capacity of the municipalities are features2\nthat can be observed consistently in rural and peri-urban zones countrywide, and which can affect3\nsanitation development to some degree.4\n3.2.3. Political patterns: lack of continuity, paternalism, decentralisation...5\nResearch on the \u2018political\u2019 patterns common to all case studies showed that short-term planning and lack6\nof political continuity are predominant features in Mexico (Cabrero Mendoza 1998; Carrera-Hernandez7\n1998). As far as sanitation development is concerned, this generally leads to a lack of coherent long-term8\nstrategy. For example, in San Luis Beltran as in the whole state of Oaxaca, the 1990s were marked by the9\nrelatively successful introduction of ecological toilets in rural areas, a low-cost approach well adapted to10\nthe irregular relief and the dispersion of the population. But at the turn of the Millennium, the newly11\nelected state authorities reverted to promoting the construction of sewer systems. Political imperatives12\ndraw their priorities. In Mexico, the periods of office of municipal and state governments respectively last13\n3 and 6 years. They are not renewable and as a consequence, each new mayor or governor wants to make14\nhistory and credit his or her party with significant deeds. The completion of large and tangible15\ninfrastructures such as roads, sidewalks and sewers provide better opportunities than dispersed ecological16\ntoilets for public celebrations of high political benefit. In Tepezal\u00e1, until very recently this political logic17\ncontributed to the relative disinterest of the municipal government in the much needed maintenance of the18\nsewer collector and the oxidation pond, which are located way out of sight from the public. In San Luis19\nBeltran, short term thinking resulted in the lack of assessment of the impacts of the sewer system on water20\nconsumption and ultimately on water availability.21\nPoor law enforcement also turns out to be a widespread manifestation of the weakness of the Mexican22\ninstitutions (Schneider and Silverman 1997; Oppenheimer 1996). The no-payment culture is one of its23\nexpressions in the watsan sector. Although not a major issue in the three case studies, it represents a24\nsignificant block to sanitation development at national scale. CONAGUA\u2019s director Luege Tamargo25\nindicates that half of Mexico City users do not pay for the water supply service (Business News Americas26\n2009). While the megalopolis expects the construction of the world biggest wastewater treatment plant27\n(which will treat 60% of the total effluent vs. only 6% currently) it remains uncertain how its operation28\nwill be financed. In the current no-payment context, massive subsidies are likely and this band-aid29\nsolution would reduce budget allocation for other sanitation projects.30\n18\nThroughout all case studies, state paternalism was found to dampen people\u2019s initiative to improve their1\nsanitary conditions. In Tepezal\u00e1, for instance, a marginalized part of the community has passively been2\nawaiting the construction of the sewer system. Despite years of waiting, they can hardly conceive of3\nimproving their sanitary conditions by themselves and hold on to thinking, as they have been used to, that4\nthe government will eventually solve it all. In San Luis Beltran, many people voted for the sewer project5\nbecause it was supposed to be free of charge, paid by the public authorities. Expecting the government to6\nsolve their problems and somewhat lured by this manna, the community members adopted the sewer7\nproject, just as they had bought in the ecological toilet program (sometimes diverting the offered8\nconstruction material for other purposes). In the case of the sewer system, the community failed to9\nexamine its possible drawbacks in terms of water availability and future wastewater treatment costs.10\nAlthough opinions differ on whether it is the product of the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party)11\nregime (Adler 2001) or a more deeply rooted cultural trait (Cabrero Mendoza 1998), state paternalism is12\nviewed as a national political feature. Other significant political features affecting sanitation development13\nall over Mexico include the recent decentralisation. It involves transfers of new functions to state and14\nmunicipal governments, which generally lack the financial, human and technical capacities to handle15\nthem, is a process which affects all the country (Nickson 1995; Rodriguez 1997; Carrera-Hernandez16\n1998). Mexican state and municipal governments generally lack the skills required to meet the challenges17\nof the watsan sector they are now in charge of.18\nFinally, a particular institutional issue, the legal fuzziness accompanying the ejido (communal owned19\nland) was found to hamper sanitation development in three case studies. In El Mirador, for instance, an20\nunclear bi-polar jurisdictional status has sustained much division within the community, contributing to a21\ndisinterest of the population in Morelos primary school. The complex organisation of the ejido, usually22\noverlapping municipal jurisdictions, often leads to fuzzy legal situations that make the management of23\nwater and sanitation issues more complicated.24\n3.2.4. Demographic patterns: urbanisation stress social and cultural structures25\nIn all three case studies urbanisation was found to influence sanitation development, although each26\ncommunity experienced the phenomenon from a different perspective. In Tepezal\u00e1, rural exodus resulted27\nin the decline of the population and local economic activity, which directly impacted the municipal28\nbudget as well as the capacity of investment in sanitation. In El Mirador as in the surrounding29\ncommunities that mushroomed around Oaxaca City during the 1990s, the watsan infrastructure is very30\n19\nprecarious but the municipal and state authorities are powerless to meet the needs of a population that1\ngrew at a rate as fast as 12 percent annually. To the people of San Luis Beltran, the expansion of the2\nurban zone means that Oaxaca City is now on their very door step. With increasing population density,3\nper capita water availability diminishes, and open-air defecation becomes less practicable and more4\ntroublesome for the neighbourhood, like the nuisances caused by inadequate or ill-operated on-site5\nsanitation system. From a public interest perspective, in this context, the sewer system may be a sensible6\noption. The younger generations, eager to embrace a modern way of life, are favourable to that option.7\nOlder people cautiously examine the recurrent invitations of the authorities to offer them the sewer, then8\nthe paved road, as they associate a loss of identity and power with this gradual integration in the urban9\nmunicipality. This phenomenon occurs all over the world: values and behaviours of rural people are10\nchallenged as soon as they live in or approach urban areas. Confrontation with the modern world typically11\nreinforces individualism and weakens traditional cultural and social structures.12\n13\n4. Evaluation14\n4.1. New insights into Mexican rural and peri-urban sanitation development15\n4.1.1. Looking at the \u2018big picture\u201916\nThe list of patterns described in the previous section reveals the multiplicity of perspectives used to17\nexamine sanitation development in rural and peri-urban Mexico. Each perspective provides an interesting18\nyet fragmented glimpse into the complexity of the problem, and the main benefit of the conceptual maps19\nis certainly to allow one to look at the \u2018big picture\u2019 and to easily relate realities traditionally addressed by20\nseparate disciplines. As each overall map reveals the complexity of the problem, the coloured concept-21\nboxes effectively signal its multidimensional nature. Their network arrangement shows the22\ninterconnectedness of the factors influencing sanitation development and promotes interdisciplinarity.23\nThe labels on concept-boxes are concise, free of expert jargon and other theoretical considerations which24\noften nurture the reluctance to shift perspectives. Taking Morelos primary school overall map for25\nexample, its mosaic-like outlook shows much interplay among social, cultural, political, economic and26\ntechnical factors. Readers will typically focus on the central white concept-boxes first and perceive the27\nkey significance of community support, community watsan infrastructure and school facilities on the28\ndevelopment of school sanitary conditions. Looking at the mass of yellow concept-boxes on the bottom-29\n20\nleft, they will perceive some of the influence of the social context (community division, teachers\u2019 low1\ncommitment to hygiene promotion, the eroding motivation of parents...) on the problem. Inevitably, the2\nnearby presence of red, grey, blue and green boxes will also attract attention on the influence of other3\ndimensions of the problem. The reader will gain understanding in the often indirect effects of political and4\ncultural factors (e.g. the cultural heterogeneity of the community, corruption), and in more direct and key5\ntechnical aspects of the problem (the insufficient capacity of the existing infrastructures, its poor6\nmaintenance, the lack of toilet paper, soap and water for hand-washing, the inappropriate design of the7\nnew toilets...). Not only do the maps favor an interdisciplinary understanding of the problem. They also8\noffer an insight into the interplay between macro and micro factors, the latter being particularly9\nsignificant in rural and peri-urban contexts. In the case of Tepezal\u00e1 (cf. Figure 7), the map stresses the key10\ninfluence of local factors \u2013 biophysical (rocky ground), social (low dwelling density, lack of leadership),11\ncultural (resignation) and economic (municipality poverty) \u2013 in the failure to extend the sewer network to12\nthe most marginalized part of the village. At the same time, the map indicates how this unique local13\ncontext is affected by macro political (paternalism, short-term planning, poor law enforcement) and14\nmacro cultural factors (duplicity, resignation).15\nAs explained in section 2.1.2., in Mexico, sanitation development tends to be perceived essentially from a16\ntechnologist point of view and a major challenge of the sector consists in developing skills in domains17\nother than purely engineering and to encourage genuine interdisciplinary approaches. The holistic insight18\nthat the conceptual maps provide in rural and peri-urban Mexico is thus particularly useful and timely. It19\nstresses the importance of institutional and community participation issues, which major donor agencies20\nhave requested the Mexican sector to consider (IDB 2010), and sheds light on the pervasive influence of21\nthe cultural context. This context comprises the traditionally addressed local elements (e.g. the set(s) of22\nvalues within a community or an ethnic group, its preference for certain sanitation options...) as well as23\nnational cultural patterns. To provide a quick and easy insight into the relationships between institutional24\nand social issues, cultural factors, and the concrete techno-economic aspects of sanitation development is25\nmost valuable in the context of the \u2018Victorian\u2019 Mexican water sector.26\n4.1.2. Promoting breadth and depth of understanding27\nThe overall maps provide a holistic view of the system and favour breadth of understanding. Yet,28\nparticularly with complex subjects, visualization tools, such as these maps, must be augmented with29\ntextual information to help users fully exploit their meaning (Tergan and Keller 2005). In this research,30\n21\nthe combined use of (i) the maps, (ii) the pictures and descriptions accompanying all connection groups,1\nand (iii) the analysis on common patterns, provides depth of insight into the components of the system2\nand their interactions. This effort towards describing in such depth and breadth the problem of sanitation3\ndevelopment in rural and peri-urban Mexico is an original and meaningful contribution to a more realistic4\nand comprehensive assessment of this critical issue.5\n4.2. Practical applications6\nExploring the maps back and forth from the global to the detail is probably the most strategic way of7\nusing them. Effective strategies will target sectors of the map, which offer the most favorable terrain for8\nchange. They may choose to boost or disrupt existing dynamics at local level, detectable on the maps as9\ncycles or feed-back loops (see Figure 9).10\nFigure 9: Positive feed-back loop \u2013 Morelos Primary School11\n12\nIn Morelos Primary school, the unsupportive regional socio-economic context (c.f. sections 3.2.2. and13\n3.2.4.) urges to seek a solution where the school addresses its sanitation development in a self-reliant14\nmanner. It may be counterproductive to try to solve the political division in the community. It may also be15\na waste of time to keep soliciting politicians for the sewer system and piped water. Collecting more funds16\nto build appropriate infrastructures will not magically solve the problems of lack of maintenance and of17\nhygiene promotion either. An attentive examination of the sub-maps and the descriptive elements18\naccompanying them may suggest instead the empowerment of the school\u2019s actors as a strategic priority19\nand recommend restoring motivation, building a common vision and commitment in the parents and in20\ntheir committee. Helping them organizing themselves, introducing rules to prevent frauds to recur,21\nproviding to the committee and the school staff a basic technical training on sanitation solutions and22\nO&M requirements would represent worthwhile activities. In all cases, effective actions will require an23\naccurate understanding of micro and macro realities. Overall maps are best used as holistic frames of24\nreference, from which micro and macro realities, as well as their relationships, can be explored through25\n22\nlinear, textual and photographical material. They provide a chance to focus on specific aspects of the1\nproblem without losing sight of how they fit with the whole.2\nPromising trends in the watsan sector include Community Led Total Sanitation (Kar 2003) and Sanitation3\nMarketing approaches, described by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) as4\n\u2018the ultimate people centred approach [which] replaces the failed supply driven approach with a more5\nsustainable holistic demand driven one [and] provides a framework in which innovation and creativity6\ncan thrive\u2019 (LSHTM 2009a). These trends share an important characteristic: while they tend to focus on7\none or several crucial aspect of the problem, such as technology uptake (e.g. improved latrine) or8\nbehaviour change (hand-washing) their strategy results from a complex, holistic understanding, which9\nconsiders a variety of techno-economic parameters, socio-cultural factors and other psychological10\nmechanisms underlying the willingness to acquire a new technology or adopt a new behaviour. LSHTM11\nstresses that the implementation of such models requires a deep knowledge of the system, gained by using12\nan interdisciplinary team of specialists (for large programmes), or by undertaking series of in-depth13\ndiscussions (for small projects) (LSHTM 2009b). The holistic approach presented in this paper may be a14\nvery relevant tool in these contexts.15\n4.3. Needs for improvements16\nThe conceptual maps developed in this research suffer several limitations, which represent as many17\nopportunities for improvement. First of all, concept-boxes are probably too numerous particularly when18\nconsidering the lack of significant perceptual patterns structuring the space, such as clusters, vertical or19\nhorizontal structures. As a result, firsthand reading is often uneasy and the use of sub-maps only partly20\nsettles this problem. Additionally, in the absence of an order of magnitude assigned to each factor, the21\nmaps lack relief. Hints are missing for the reader to spot the zones of particular importance. In this22\nrespect, the often pervasive influences of macro-factors (e.g. corruption, machismo, lack of political23\ncontinuity, urbanization, and paternalism) require more consideration than what their limited graphical24\nimpact on the maps suggests. Thicker lines could be drawn between important concepts (Radzicki and25\nTaylor 1997). Ranking factors is a complicated and excessively reductionist solution (i.e. grading on the26\nsame scale factors addressing different dimensions) subject too much bias. Besides, the magnitude of a27\nfactor might not necessarily determine its strategic relevance. Very significant systemic factors such as28\npoverty and corruption may be overly difficult to address in a local sanitation development project. They29\nmay not be actually \u2018killer issues\u2019, and strategies summoning local human resources may allow them to30\n23\nbe overcome. At the opposite, seemingly secondary factors, such as gender issues (e.g. machismo) and1\ncommunity leadership, may prove very strategic targets. The map can then serve as a common basis for2\nan interdisciplinary team of practitioners. Its strategic worth is associated with the in-depth study of all its3\ncomponents. It depends on the experience and capacity to interact of its users, who will be able to add4\nrelief to the map and identify opportunity areas.5\nThe maps amalgamate factors addressing very distinct realities. For instance, some concept-boxes6\ndescribe the influence of inter-subjective realities (e.g. \u2018mistrust prevails in the community\u2019), while others7\ndescribe tangible physical realities (e.g. \u2018there is no piped water supply at school\u2019), social structures,8\npeople\u2019s individual or collective behaviours (e.g. \u2018the head of the parents\u2019 committee did not finish9\nbuilding the cistern toilets\u2019, \u2018Parents have stopped paying for the daily maintenance of the latrines\u2019). A10\nbetter structuring of these diverse dimensions would certainly improve the comprehensibility of such11\ncomplex systems. Lack of clear demarcations between spatial scales is another limitation: factors12\naddressing local, regional and national phenomena are all mixed. The preferential arrangement of macro13\nlevel factors at the periphery of the map is an insufficient hint. In an increasingly global world, more14\ndiscernment on this spatial dimension is required. Scale is actually regarded as a critical dimension in the15\nHCES (Household Centred Environmental Sanitation) approach, which insists that problem need to be16\nsolved as near to the point where they occur as possible. HCES thus establishes a series of zones within17\nan area: the household, the neighborhood, the community, a city ward, the city itself, and ultimately the18\nwider environment, such as a river basin (EWAG 2005). This zoning principle may be integrated in the19\nmaps. Another observation can be made regarding the consideration of macro factors: in addition to20\nexamining the influence of these macro demographic, economic, political and cultural patterns on local21\ndynamics, as undertaken in this research, there is a need to assess how the community relates to the22\nexisting federal, state and municipal programs for sanitation development. Although the research process23\ndid not systematically open avenues of inquiry in this direction, understanding the details of Mexican24\nprograms, such as PROSANEAR (Federal program for wastewater sanitation) and PROSSAPYS25\n(Program for the construction and rehabilitation of drinking water supply systems and sanitation in rural26\nzones), and particularly the factors governing the eligibility of a municipality and a community, must be27\npart of a strategic assessment.28\n29\n30\n24\n5. Conclusion1\nThe holistic approach presented in this paper fosters an interdisciplinary understanding of rural and peri-2\nurban sanitation development. Its implementation in Mexico demonstrated its effectiveness in achieving a3\ncomprehensive assessment of the problem locally while at the same time establishing the key influence of4\nmacro political, economical, cultural, and demographic factors. The conceptual maps successfully5\nhighlight the interconnectedness of all micro and macro factors affecting sanitation development. They6\nrepresent useful frames of reference, which allow the in-depth exploration of the different aspects of the7\nsystem through more analytical means, without losing sight of how they fit within the big picture. These8\nmaps provide to a large audience the opportunity to quickly seize how objective structures (e.g.9\nbiophysical, social) and less tangible cultural realities influence sanitation development. These didactic10\ntools are appropriate for training activities promoting integrated watsan development. Notably,11\nconsidering the current transition in the sector from a fundamentally \u2018technologist\u2019 perspective of the12\nproblem to a more complex understanding of it, the approach presented in this paper can be helpful for13\nwatsan engineers, who have sometimes been criticised for showing resistance to embracing the concept of14\na multidisciplinary approach (Schouten and Moriarty 2003, Boss, 2001). It can be productively used by15\nthe interdisciplinary teams increasingly deployed in watsan development programs to undertake16\ncomprehensive assessments, and particularly in programs built upon integrated strategies such as17\nCommunity Led Total Sanitation or Sanitation Marketing. Avenues for improvement include situating18\neach community in the context of the federal, state and municipal programs for sanitation development.19\nThe means of representation can be improved. Structuring the visual space around two key variables:20\nscale (dwelling, community, district, state, country, global levels) and \u2018factor dimension\u2019 (objective:21\nbiophysical, behavioural, social; subjective and inter-subjective\/cultural) seems very relevant.22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n25\nReferences1\nAdler, A.
