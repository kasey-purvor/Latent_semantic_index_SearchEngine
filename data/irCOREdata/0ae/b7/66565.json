Patterns and associations of wealth and poverty have become \nmore diffuse and diverse as non-farm opportunities have expanded and heightened levels of \nmobility have led to the delocalisation of livelihoods. This, in turn, has had ramifications for the \nproduction and reproduction of poverty in the countryside, which is becoming progressively \nde-linked from agricultural resources. This requires a reconsideration of some old questions \nregarding how best to achieve pro-poor development in the Rural South.  \n \nKeywords \nRural South, Asia, agrarian change, poverty, rural livelihoods \n 3 \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper has benefited from the considered and constructive comments of two referees. It \nalso draws on continuing discussions in connection with a Social Sciences and Humanities \nResearch Council of Canada (SSHRC) funded research project \u201eThe challenges of the \nagrarian transition in Southeast Asia\u201f (SSHRC 412-2004-1008) led by Professor Rodolphe de \nKoninck of the University of Montreal. \n \n \n \n 4 \n1. FEET OF CLAY: OUTLINING THE ISSUES (SIMPLY) \nFor most scholars and development practitioners, the poor world is largely a rural world and, \nin terms of livelihoods, this rural world is an agricultural one where farming predominates and \nwhere land is the critical resource. The assumption, sometimes explicitly stated but more \noften implicit, is that the solution to global poverty lies in the invigoration of farming and the \nredistribution of land. It is, in short, at the nexus between land and agricultural productivity \nthat a resolution to rural poverty in the Global South \u2013 and therefore to global poverty \u2013 is to \nbe found. For the UK\u201fs Department for International Development, \u201c\u2026land is a fundamental \nlivelihood asset [and] secure, safe and affordable land is a necessary, but not always \nsufficient condition for reducing poverty (page 1)\u201d (DFID, 2002a and see DFID, 2002b). \nWriting of rural Asia, Ali and Pernia state that \u201e\u201ctypically, the incidence of rural poverty is \ninversely related to the size of landholdings, decreasing from landless to submarginal, \nmarginal to small, then to large farmers\u201d (Ali & Pernia, 2003: 3). \nIn light of views such as these, it is no surprise that development interventions tend to \nfocus on the redistribution of rural resources and\/or on a (re-)invigoration of agricultural \nproduction. While the ideological inclination of those recommending fundamental land reform \non the one hand, or the dissemination of new agricultural technologies (such as those of the \nGreen Revolution) on the other may be different, they nonetheless identify the solution to rural \npoverty and underproduction lying in the countryside and, more particularly, in agricultural \nproduction. Not only do they see land\/farming as a core ingredient in the essential recipe for \nrural development, but this is invariably framed in terms of small holder production. In these \nways at least, they share the same ground and a common vision. \nThis paper seeks to challenge this farming- and land-focused vision on the basis that \nit overlooks the direction and trajectory of change in the Rural South and, therefore, also \noverlooks the emerging spaces for development intervention. It is in assuming that we should \nlook to farming and the distribution and availability of resources in the countryside to address \nrural poverty that, it is argued, the difficulties and inconsistencies arise. In making this case, \nwhich I recognise will be contentious at times and problematic in places, I wish to link different \nbodies of work on agrarian change, namely: work on the structural transformations driving \ndeagrarianization; on the production and reproduction of poverty in the countryside; on \nlivelihoods; and on cultures of modernity. To do this, the paper will draw on evidence from \nacross the Rural South and will attempt to make a generalised case that has resonance and \nrelevance at a global level. In places, however, it will be necessary to flesh out and \nsubstantiate the broader assertions with detailed evidence and case studies, requiring a \ndegree of elaboration at the local level. This more detailed material will be drawn, to a large \nextent, from the Southeast Asian region.\ni\n  It is accepted that there are dangers in drawing \nassociational links between \u201echerry picked\u201f case studies and the general experience of rural \ndevelopment. Nonetheless the paper intentionally attempts to get beyond the particular to \nreflect on the broader canvas of change. \n \n(a) The role of land and farming: the Rural South and the Rural North \nLivelihoods in the Rural South do, in many places and for many households \u2013 perhaps even \nin most places and for most households \u2013 continue to depend on small holder agricultural \nproduction. The large majority of people in the Global South live in the countryside and the \nlivelihoods of most, it would seem, are dependent on farming (Table 1). But, and even putting \naside data deficiencies which would indicate that the figures in Table 1 overstate the role of \nfarming and the size of the rural population and understate the level of out-migration from \nrural areas (see Deshingkar, 2005: 14-15), there is the important issue of whether the present \nstate of affairs in the Rural South will have any historical resilience. In other words, do the \npresent and the past offer a reasonable guide to the future? Writing of Africa \u2013 the world\u201fs \nmost agrarian continent \u2013 Bryceson challenges \u201cthe unwarranted assumption that the African \ncontinent\u201fs destiny is necessarily rooted in peasant agriculture\u201d (1997a: 3 [emphasis in \noriginal]).  \n[Table 1 about here] \nScholars and development agencies do acknowledge the growing role of non-farm \nactivities (local and extra-local) in rural economies and livelihoods. But the abiding sense is \nthat these activities are still regarded as add-ons to the main business of farming. In the case \nof rural-urban migration such is the level of official disquiet that it is not uncommon for policy-\nmakers and some scholars to propose controlling the process. The argument pursued in this \npaper is that not only are non-farm activities becoming central to rural livelihoods but also that \n 5 \nan increasing number of rural households have no commitment to farming whatsoever. It is \nnot, therefore, just a question of weighting and balance, but of a more profound transition \nfrom one way of making a living, to another. \nAs a way into the discussion that follows, it is worth briefly reflecting on the recent \nhistorical experiences of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea where rural landscapes have been \nprofoundly transformed over the last 30 or 40 years. The agrarian transitions of those \ncountries have been collapsed into just two decades. No longer is access to land a necessary \ncondition for reducing poverty, and farming is just one activity among many in the countryside. \nIndeed, \u201conce the major source of income and employment, the agricultural sectors of Japan, \nKorea and Taiwan gave up resources to the growing non-agricultural sector until, after \nremarkably short periods of time by international standards, protection and subsidisation \nbecame essential to their survival\u201d (Francks et al., 1999: 215). While the pace of change in \nEast Asia has been truly remarkable, the experience of the region does show how livelihoods \nand production in the countryside can be reworked in less than a generation, even while \nhouseholds retain their rural base. More recently, countries like Malaysia have experienced a \nsimilarly rapid and deep agrarian transformation.  \nGiven the rate of rural transformations in some countries, it becomes all the more \nsurprising how wedded scholars and development practitioners are to the rural\/land\/farming \nparadigm summarised above. One of the key lessons of longitudinal village studies is how \nscholars characteristically misinterpret the trajectory of change in \u201etheir\u201f communities.\nii\n When \nMichael Moerman returned to Ban Ping in Chiang Rai province in the Northern region of \nThailand after an absence of just four years he found that farmers\u201f actions had confounded \nhis expectations: \u201cIt would be false to say that I had predicted this change, and dishonest not \nto confess that it surprised me\u201d (1968: 185).\niii\n Eder, in his study (1999) of San Jose on \nPalawan in the Philippines gives an even more vivid impression of a scholar struggling to \nkeep up with the pace of village change, leaving him with \u201cthe nagging feeling that I was \nsomehow missing a vital larger picture\u201d by using an original methodology that had \u201cfailed to \ncapture change over time in the economic strategies of\u2026households [and] other significant \ndeterminants of\u2026household economic behaviour, particularly changing cultural values and \nideologies\u201d (Eder, 1999: xi).\niv\n  \nOne of the most illuminating examples of longitudinal research \u2013 and learning \u2013 is \nprovided by the work of Piers Blaikie and his colleagues in Nepal. In the mid-1970s Blaikie et \nal. (1980, 2002) believed that road-induced and market-led integration in west-central Nepal \nwould \u201cnot deliver the benefits of increased agricultural production, increased \ncommercialisation, and trade as forecast in the economic appraisal documents\u201d (2002: 1256). \nThe outcome, they reasoned, would be a deepening dependency and growing \nunderdevelopment. The non-agricultural sources of employment and income that did exist at \nthat time (such as employment in foreign armies) would not, in their view, postpone the \n\u201egeneral crisis in the hills\u201f for very much longer (Blaikie et al., 1980: 284). In a follow-up study \nin 1998 the same authors note that their pessimistic outlook did not materialise and admit that \nthe essence of some of their original conclusions was wrong. Dependency may have \ndeepened, but in a broadly positive manner, delivering higher incomes, more resilient \nlivelihoods and higher standards of living (2002: 1268 and see Blaikie et al., 2001). The \nauthors conclude: \u201cThe original model underestimated the capacity of the global labour \nmarket to provide work and remittances to sustain rural life and to stave off a more \ngeneralized crisis\u2026\u201d (2002: 1268\u20139). \nIt may be that sheer familiarity with their subjects makes it difficult for scholars \nworking at the village level to see the wood for the trees \u2013 I, certainly, have fallen into this trap \n\u2013 and to place their communities in the larger national and international contexts. The \npopularity of farmer-first approaches to both research and development may have also, \nunwittingly, contributed to forging generally narrow and often static interpretations of village \nconditions. Villager responses, based on bounded, indigenous knowledges, will tend to \nreinforce the status quo and legitimate existing conditions (see Mosse, 2001; Rigg, 1995). \nResearchers often take these at face value. Rhetorically, how can villagers who have culture \nin their blood, soil under their finger nails, and bodies stretched by their labor on the land \npossibly not know the direction they are headed far better than any academic cosseted in her \nor his university, not to mention government officials cocooned in capital cities and provincial \ncentres? Even the international banks have been accused of narrowness of vision when it \ncomes to the countryside. \u201cThe policy recommendations emanating from the World Bank and \nother international and national agencies over the past decade\u201d Bryceson states, \u201chave been \n 6 \nrooted in the stale assumption dating back to the colonial period that Africa is fundamentally \nan agrarian continent whose interface with the world market now and for the foreseeable \nfuture is in agricultural commodity exchange\u201d (Bryceson, 1997a: 11). \n \n2. TRAJECTORIES OF CHANGE IN THE RURAL SOUTH \nIn this section of the paper, the wider context will be outlined. Inevitably, in cavalierly \nsqueezing the whole experience of change in the Rural South into a handful of paragraphs \nthere will be gaps, oversights and grand generalisations. The purpose, however, is not to \nprovide a balanced overview of the current situation in the Rural South but, instead, to identify \nand highlight those features of change that are seen to be likely to become more pronounced \nover time. In other words, what are the points of transformation and the broad direction of \nchange? To summarise, the following processes and trends are occurring over a broad front: \n \n Occupations and livelihoods in the countryside are diversifying \n Occupational multiplicity is becoming more common and more pronounced \n The balance of household income is shifting from farm to non-farm \n Livelihoods and poverty are becoming de-linked from land (and from farming) \n Lives are becoming more mobile and livelihoods correspondingly delocalised \n Remittances are playing a growing role in rural household incomes \n The average age of farmers is rising \n Cultural and social changes are being implicated in livelihood modifications, and in \nnew ways  \n \nThe village of East Laguna in the Philippines has been studied continuously since Hayami set \nout from the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba\u00f1os in September 1974 to find a \n\u201etypical rice village\u201f (Hayami & Kikuchi, 2000).\nv\n By the end of the 1990s, around a quarter of a \ncentury on from this initial foray, the region of east Laguna remained rural and the village was \nsurrounded by rice fields.\nvi\n While the village appears to be \u201cas dormant [today]\u2026as it was \nwhen we first visited it in the 1970s\u201d, the reality is that East Laguna Village had become, by \nthen, a very different place from the village selected some 30 years earlier. The closure of the \nland frontier, rapid population growth, new rice technologies, the infiltration of urban mores, \npublic investment in infrastructure such as roads and schools, rising levels of landlessness, \nand the introduction of manufacturing activities in the village were just some of the changes to \nhave buffeted the community and the wider region. East Laguna Village shows, in microcosm, \nthe ways in which rural communities and agrarian economies across many parts of the \nSoutheast Asian region are changing. In summary, over two decades the contribution of \nfarming to household income declined from close to 90% to 36%, while the share of non-farm \nincome rose from 13% to 64% (Figure 1). \n[Figure 1 about here] \nA similar picture of rural economic diversification and a progressive shift from farm to \nnon-farm livelihoods is evident in the DORAS field survey of 45 sites in the Central Plains of \nThailand undertaken in 1994-5, and in the same study\u201fs more detailed examination of three \nvillages in 1998-2000. The team found that 57% of farm households surveyed had multiple \noccupations that included one outside agriculture, and that farming was rapidly becoming a \nsubsidiary activity for many rural households in the region, the so-styled \u201erice basket\u201f of \nThailand (DORAS, 1996: 160; Molle et al., 2001). Coupled with these structural and \noccupational shifts were demographic transformations in the make up of farming families. In \nthe six core provinces of the Central Plains region the number of landholders aged 35 years \nor under declined from 24% in 1963 to 17% in 1978 and by 1993 had reached just 12%.\nvii\n The \nnumber of landholders aged over 55 years old, meanwhile, increased over the same period \nfrom 28% to 37% (Molle & Thippawal Srijantr, 1999: 25). \nWhile in Central Thailand occupational multiplicity may be highlighted as the \nemerging norm, Eder\u201fs study of San Jose noted above identifies a significant increase in \nhouseholds who have no engagement with farming whatsoever (Figure 2). While those \nengaged only in farming remained relatively unchanged between 1971 and 1988, pluriactive \nhouseholds spanning the farm\/non-farm divide declined from 58% to 32%, while those \ndisengaged from farming more than doubled from 20% to 45% (Eder, 1999). This shift has an \nimportant generational angle: \u201ecore\u201f households (i.e. those that were present in 1971) show a \npreponderance of families with livelihoods based on farm activities or farm plus non-farm \n 7 \nactivities; for \u201eoff-spring\u201f households (those established since 1971), however, non-farm-\nbased livelihoods are the most important category (Figure 3).\nviii\n  \n[Figures 2 and 3 about here] \nIn India, the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has been \nundertaking a continuing survey of rural households in 240 villages across 16 states since \n1968. This rich data source shows that between 1971 and 1999 the share of non-farm \nincomes in total rural incomes rose from 19% to 48% (Foster & Rosenzweig, 2004: 517-8). \nAnother large scale study is the Deagrarianistion and Rural Employment (DARE) research \nprogramme undertaken in six African countries (Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Malawi, \nZimbabwe and South Africa) between 1996 and 1998. This provides the fullest and most up-\nto-date picture of what is happening to livelihoods and activity in rural Africa (see Bryceson, \n2002). The headline figure is that the DARE programme found non-agricultural (non-farm) \nactivities contributing a \u201eremarkable\u201f 60%-80% of rural household income (Bryceson, 2002: \n730), significantly higher than the usually quoted figure of around 40%.\nix\n The study also \nrevealed a \u201eyouthful wave\u201f (page 733) of workers in non-farm activities.  \nThis latter point \u2013 that there is a generational angle to deagrarianization where \nfarming becomes, increasingly, a preserve of the old(er) \u2013 is most pronounced in East Asia. \nAt the extreme, in Japan, by the early 1990s, one third of the agricultural labor force was \nalready more than 65 years in age and the proportion in 2000 was over one half (Francks et \nal., 1999: 82 and Economist 2005: 74).\nx\n In some more remote upland areas of Japan the farm \nhousehold has simply been unable to reproduce itself and land lies abandoned.\nxi\n The figures \nfor South Korea are no less dramatic: by 1990, 55% of the labor force in agriculture was over \n50 years of age. Twenty years earlier, in 1970, it was just 20% (Francks et al., 1999: 157). \n\u201eNorth Subang\u201f in West Java, like East Laguna in the Philippines and the villages in \nthe Central Plains of Thailand, \u201cappears to the visitor as the prototype of [an] agrarian \nsettlement\u201d and is situated in the heart of the \u201erice basket\u201f of the island (Breman & Wiradi, \n2002: 42).\nxii\n Nonetheless, between 1990 and 1998 the share of the working population in \nNorth Subang engaged in agricultural pursuits fell from 75% to 58% (Figure 4). By 1998, two-\nthirds of households had at least one member working fully or largely outside agriculture, up \nfrom one-third in 1990. Had krismon (the Indonesian economic crisis) not occurred this trend \nwould have been yet more pronounced, but even so the authors suggest that \u201cNorth Subang \nis becoming less and less a rural settlement dominated by agriculture\u201d (Breman & Wiradi, \n2002: 101). Importantly, almost all the growth in non-farm employment between 1990 and \n1998 was extra-local; non-farm employment in the village itself had stagnated. But while \nextra-local employment may have blossomed, the livelihood implications cannot simply be \n\u201eread-off\u201f from this fact. Of the 82 villagers working outside the village (up from 40 in 1990) \nonly nine were in well paid employment requiring a high level of skill. The remainder were \ndivided between those who were self-employed (19, mostly petty traders in Jakarta), and \nthose engaged in casual work (45, mostly earth movers). It would be tempting in this instance \nto assume that casual work of this kind is poverty-perpetuating because it does not deliver \nsignificantly higher incomes than farm work (on a daily basis). What it may do, however, is \nfree villagers from the employment constraints of the agricultural seasons, allowing people to \nwork through the year, so providing more regular work and income while also permitting \nscope for the creative combination of farming and non-farm activities. \n[Figure 4 about here] \nThe final example comes from one of the world\u201fs poorest and most agrarian \ncountries, the Lao People\u201fs Democratic Republic where, it is said, two-thirds of the rural \npopulation (which comprise 80% of the total) are subsistence cultivators (Lao PDR, 2003: 5). \nBut even here, the effects of economic reform, marketisation and the integration of the \ncountry into the wider Greater Mekong Sub-region are rapidly transforming peasants in some \nareas into post-peasants. The evidence is patchy but, nonetheless, significant (see Rigg, \n2005b). In late 2000 the ILO undertook a survey of illegal migrant workers to Thailand from 13 \nvillages in seven districts in the three Lao border provinces of Khammouan, Savannakhet and \nChampassak (Inthasone Phetsiriseng, 2001). The survey covered 1,614 families. This is, so \nfar, the most complete picture we have of levels of mobility and some of the underlying \nconditions and forces which are driving the process. On the basis of this survey, it would \nseem that the level of human mobility has escalated dramatically in the years since the mid- \nto late-1990s so that by 2000 between three and 13% of the populations of the study \ncommunities were working in Thailand (Figure 5). Lao illegal migrants, mainly young, are \nbeing channelled into low wage employment in textiles, construction, \u201eentertainment\u201f, food \n 8 \nprocessing and domestic work, as well as into farm-based wage labor. In some of the study \nvillages, migration to Thailand has become so pronounced that it has begun to influence the \navailability of labor for agriculture and a clear \u201egap\u201f has emerged in the labor force of those \naged 15\u201318 years old. \n[Figure 5 about here] \nHow households and villages in circumstances of labor deficit respond would seem to \ndepend on the level of remittances, labor costs in rural areas, and the willingness of other \nworkers to fill the labor void. In Cavite in the Philippines labor gangs have been enticed in \nfrom neighbouring provinces to take advantage of the relatively high agricultural wages, \nthemselves a product of the availability of non-farm work in the local export processing zone \n(Kelly, 1999). In Bangladesh it seems that heightened levels of rural-urban migration, \nassociated labor shortages and the remittances that flow from the process have invigorated \nthe land tenancy market, increased agricultural productivity by promoting mechanisation while \nalso raising rural wages (Afsar, 2003: 14-15). In Peninsular Malaysia, and even with \nsignificant in-flows of laborers from Indonesia, Thailand and Bangladesh, large areas of \nagricultural land are simply left idle (Kato, 1994).  \nStudies from Bangladesh (Afsar, 2003), China (de Brauw et al., 2001), and Asia more \nwidely (Deshingkar, 2005) identify important structural changes in the composition and \nsources of rural household incomes. These include a declining share from agriculture, \ngrowing levels of mobility and associated remittance flows, a diversification of household and \nrural economies, and an increase in income for those \u201eleft behind\u201f. As one would expect, there \nare no neat, blanket generalisations that can be made about the effects of these changes in \nthe Rural South except to note that they are having important \u2013 though variable \u2013 impacts on \npoverty, production and productivity, patterns of consumption, economic growth, investment, \ngender relations and inequality in the countryside. While the identification of general effects \nmay be problematic, it is possible to identify some common forces propelling these wide scale \nchanges in the composition and trajectory of economic activity and livelihoods in the Rural \nSouth. Individual cases will, necessarily, be individual but five propelling forces would seem to \nhave some degree of common currency across the Rural South even if their relative \nimportance varies between sites, countries and continents. These are: \n \n The erosion of the profitability and returns to small holder agricultural production \n The emergence of new opportunities in the non-farm sector, both local and non-local \n Environmental degradation \n Increasing land shortages \n Cultural and social change \n \nIn Table 2 these forces \u2013 which are termed \u201efirst level propelling forces\u201f \u2013 are underpinned by \na raft of \u201esecond-level propelling forces\u201f, not all of which will be found in individual countries or \ncases. The broad outcome though, will be similar \u2013 to squeeze farming and agriculture in a \nvariety of ways. As ever, the devil is in the detail but it is nonetheless valuable to take a step \nback from the minutiae of individual cases in this way to see whether the larger picture has \nany coherence and any common features. \n[Table 2 about here] \n (a) The role of culture and society: factors and positions \nOf the first level propelling factors identified above it is the last \u2013 cultural and social change \u2013 \nwhich has received the least attention, perhaps because it is the most nebulous and difficult \nto pin down. Maybe it is also because the analysis of agricultural and employment change \nhas tended to be concentrated, in the social sciences, in economics and associated \ndisciplines. Land shortages, environmental degradation, structural changes in the economy \nand in employment are generally well documented, even if some key implications (as \nsuggested here) are overlooked. Cultural and social factors and, less obviously, social and \ncultural positions, are also deeply implicated in the economic changes outlined above and in \npeople\u201fs views of these changes. \nTo begin with the positions that people take, it is not unusual for government officials, \ndevelopment practitioners as well as researchers to express a strong moral preference \n(Bryceson, 1997a: 9) for village life and rural pursuits. There is a normative position that rural \npeople should remain in the countryside and in farming. Villages are viewed as units of \nculture and social organisation and are seen to have a certain moral validity which can be \ntraced back through history and which is firmly embedded in local cultural norms and social \n 9 \npractices and structures.\nxiii\n It is when villages are fragmented by modernity, when village \nproduction is undermined by industrialisation, and when villagers are extracted from their \nnatal homes that things are perceived to go wrong. Farrington et al. term this the \u201eyeoman \nfarmer fallacy\u201f (Farrington et al., 2002: 15). \nThis positioning of farming, villages and the countryside sometimes begins with an \nattempt to place farming at the centre of national identity. Falvey, on Thai agriculture, writes: \n\u201cAgriculture has created Thailand and continues to shape Thai identity, support Thai lifestyles, \nand portray the Kingdom to the world\u201d (2000: 17; see also Rigg & Ritchie, 2002). In Malaysia, \nthe soul of the Malay, and therefore the soul of Malaysia, is still widely felt to be centred on a \nkampong (village) life and a rice-based livelihood. There often emerges a disjuncture between \nhow some elites view farming and agriculture (often from afar), and how rural people view the \noccupation. In the east coast state of Kelantan the great bulk of the population are Malay and \nthe primary economic activity is still small holder agriculture. Yet the \u201cfabric of rural life in \nKelantan has been transformed over the past two decades by the outmigration of young \nKelantanese women to factory jobs in Penang\u201d (Kusago & Barham, 2001: 1239). The \nassociation of Malay identity with farming continues, even while Malays themselves are \nmigrating in ever-growing numbers out of farming and away from the kampong. \nThat migration and mobility are playing a growing role in livelihoods in the Rural \nSouth is generally acknowledged and there is a rich literature on the topic. Surprisingly, \nthough \u2013 partly, perhaps, for the reasons outlined above combined with the general \nunderestimation of the scale of migration noted earlier in the paper \u2013 government agencies \nhave continued to overlook this progressive disembedding of rural livelihoods from rural \nspaces. Writing of seasonal labour migration in rural Nepal, Gill concludes that it is \u201ctoo \nimportant a topic for policy makers to continue to overlook\u201d (2003: 28). For India, it has been \nstated that \u201cofficial awareness of the magnitude of seasonal migration or the importance of it \nin the lives of the [rural] poor is abysmally low\u201d (Deshingkar & Start, 2003: 1; see also Dang \n2003). In South Asia, as in Southeast Asia and many parts of Africa there is, it seems, a \nparadigmatic blind spot on the part of officials when it comes to understanding rural \nlivelihoods in terms of non-local activities. In those instances where farming is not seen as \ncentral to national identity, there is often still the widespread belief that rural people are \nsomehow \u201eattached\u201f to the land in a primordial sense and that if migration is occurring it \nshould be controlled (Deshingkar 2005: 27-8). Hamilton and Fischer, writing of the Maya \nfarmers of Guatemala state that \u201cethnographers have long noted Maya peoples\u201f attachment \nto the land\u201d and add that this is \u201ca trait broadly shared among farming and peasant peoples \nthe world over\u201d (2003: 90). Such axioms are erected partly so that they can be challenged \nand the assumption of peasant attachment to the land is one such. \nFrom the perspective of villagers themselves, a rather different view often presents \nitself. Education, newspapers, radio and television, and consumerism more generally have \nprofoundly altered the way that rural people think about work, farming and their \u2013 and more \nparticularly, their children\u201fs \u2013 futures. Rural existences are becoming almost as monetised in \ncountries like Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia as are urban lives.\nxiv\n Farming has become, \noften in little more than a decade, a low status occupation to be avoided. This view has a \nmarked generational component: it is younger people who most urgently and fervently wish to \nbuild futures that avoid farming (Table 3). Not surprisingly, those who express some concern \nat the pace and direction of change tend to be the older generations. There is a \nmethodological challenge in seeing this shift in generational terms, namely: how far does it \nreflect life cycle changes \u2013 implying that these young people will, in time, see the attractions \nof agriculture and return to farming \u2013 and how far is it part of a more profound and permanent \nprocess of cultural change which will feed through into later life? Both are, self-evidently, at \nwork: there are behaviours, views and outlooks that can be associated with particular stages \nin the life course; there are also those that reflect the era in which people are living (see Monk \n& Katz, 1993). But, just as economic remittances fuelled by migration can transform income, \ninvestment and consumption patterns, so \u201esocial remittances\u201f can transform production and \nconsumption practices (see Goldring, 2004). There is a need, therefore, to tie economic and \nlivelihood changes (with which this paper is primarily concerned) into wider social and cultural \nmodifications. \n[Table 3 about here] \n3. POVERTY TRANSITIONS IN THE NEW RURAL SOUTH \nThe paper now reaches its last substantive section in which I want to reflect on the production \nand reproduction of poverty in the Rural South in the light of the changes outlined above. The \n 10 \nquestion that underpins this next section is straight forward, at least in the asking: how have \nthese evolving changes to livelihoods influenced the production and reproduction of poverty in \nthe countryside? \n \n(a) \u2018Old\u2019 poverty and \u2018new\u2019 poverty \nFor many in the mainstream of development work, poverty is an inheritance of the past.  \nIndividuals living simple and meagre lives are, almost necessarily, poor. The drive for market \nintegration is founded on the assumption that it is because people are physically and mentally \nseparated from the mainstream (i.e. from the market and from the state) that they are poor. In \nthe case of Laos, the concentration of scarce resources on the construction of roads is \nfounded on just such a belief and literature on the country is replete with references to the \nneed to intensify market relations if poverty is to be reduced. The World Bank, for example, \noffers the view that \u201c\u2026remoteness is an important cause of rural poverty [in Laos]\u2026\u201d (World \nBank, 1999: 7) while the UNDP argues that \u201clack of access causes poverty\u201d in the country \n(UNDP, 1996: 3; see also Rigg 2005b). This conceptualisation of poverty is termed here \u201eold \npoverty\u201f. \nThere is also a thread of literature on Laos, and on other countries, that sees poverty \nas in large part created by the development process: \u201cIt is perhaps warranted to assume that \nin the majority of cases [in Laos], those groups who are living more of less traditional \nexistences based on subsistence agriculture have ample nourishment and lead normal lives \nby their own standards. \u2026 It may likewise be assumed that those who are diagnosed as \nextremely poor or starving have been victims of man-made social or environmental upheaval, \nnot infrequently in the name of rural development\u201d (ILO, 2000: 9). It has been the engagement \nof people with the market and the Lao state that has made them poor (ADB, 2001). It is in this \nway that poverty in Laos (and elsewhere) is conceptualised as \u201enew\u201f. \nIt is all too easy to see \u201eold\u201f poverty being the standard view of the mainstream, \nincluding governments and multilateral agencies, and \u201enew\u201f poverty being embraced by \nradical scholars and many development workers linked to NGOs. More important than \ndeciding which one of these views is \u201eright\u201f \u2013 and in a sense they both are \u2013 is to consider \ntheir implications for our understanding of the production and reproduction of poverty and in \nterms of the earlier discussion.  \n \n(i) The production and reproduction of poverty I \nIn a rural context where livelihoods are fundamentally founded on agriculture, poverty is a \nproduct of resource failures and inequalities, and central to this are the distribution and \nproductivity of land. We can, in such a context, conceptualise poverty being reproduced over \ntime through inequalities in access to resources (especially land) being passed from one \ngeneration to the next. Poverty, in this sense, is inherited as, of course, is wealth. The cry of \n\u201eland to the tiller\u201f and the impetus for land reform in many countries are propelled by a wish to \nbreak this cycle and the generalised failure to grasp the nettle of reform led many to predict, \nin the 1970s and 1980s, an impending agrarian crisis in a range of countries.\nxv\n That these \ncrises have not, in the main, materialised has been due to a range of factors, but two stand \nout. First, productivity increases in some areas of farming have been greater than anticipated \nand have permitted rural households to maintain their existing standards of living on declining \nareas of farmland and, at least, staved off a progressive process of immiseration in the \ncountryside. Second and more important, however, has been the rapid diversification of rural \nlivelihoods, a marked increase in mobility, and a proliferation in opportunities outside farming. \nIt is this second tranche of changes that require a reconsideration of how poverty is produced \nand reproduced in the new Rural South. To illustrate this, consider the experience of Mrs \nChandaeng. \nMrs Chandaeng lives in Ban Sawai in Sang Thong district around 60 km from \nVientiane, the capital of Laos. We interviewed her at the end of 2001. She was born and \nraised in Xieng Khouang province. Here she met and married her husband. They left the war-\nshattered province to settle in her husband\u201fs natal village and lived there until he died in 1988 \nwhen Mrs Chandaeng was 37 years old and her youngest daughter just two. A dispute with \nher husband\u201fs brother forced Mrs Chandaeng to move once again and she settled in Ban \nSawai with her young family in 1991. Unable to secure any land beyond her house plot she \nstruggled to raise her six children. Her ability to survive \u2013 and indeed, finally to prosper \u2013 as a \nlandless, widowed mother of six was linked, ultimately, to the fact that four of her children \nmanaged to secure work in neighbouring Thailand. At the time we interviewed Mrs \n 11 \nChandaeng, her children were remitting around US$25\u201350 a month. At that time her son was \nworking as a laborer on a shrimp farm while her three daughters, Wan (19 years old), Lot \n(17), and Daeng (15) were employed as housekeepers in Bangkok. With these funds Mrs \nChandaeng was financing the construction of a new house. She may have explained her \nchildren\u201fs sojourns in Thailand in terms of \u201ewhen you are poor, you have to go\u201f, but the \noutcome was a degree of economic prosperity, at least in village terms. \nIn Laos \u2013 one of Asia\u201fs most \u201erural\u201f countries \u2013 Mrs Chandaeng may still be the \nexception to the rule, but this is not true everywhere in Laos (see Figure 5 and the discussion \nin connection with this figure), and even less so in most other countries in the region. The key \npoint is that the production and therefore the reproduction of poverty are becoming de-linked \nfrom land and from agricultural resources more widely. It is becoming increasingly difficult, \noften impossible, to \u201eread off\u201f poverty on the basis of the usual markers. Sen addresses a \nsimilar set of processes and issues in Bangladesh where he writes that a \u201erice-centric\u201f \ninterpretation of rural development is \u201cfast approaching its limit\u201d (Sen, 2003: 516). In his study, \nthe key factor distinguishing \u201eascending\u201f from \u201edescending\u201f households is the degree to which \nthe former have managed to display \u201cstrong non-agricultural orientations\u201d (2003: 521). \nIn Hayami and Kikuchi\u201fs (2000) study of East Laguna a similarly sharp de-linking of \nland from livelihoods, and therefore of land from poverty, is evident. Importantly, this has \noccurred in the context of significant agricultural progress. The 1950s saw the extension of \nirrigation to the village and the introduction of double cropping (an \u201eepochal change\u201f [page \n27]), permitting output to rise and keep pace with population growth even with the closure of \nthe land frontier and growing land scarcity. This was followed, from the mid-1960s, by the \nrapid diffusion of the bio-chemical innovations linked to the new rice technology \u2013 high \nyielding seeds, and the application of increasing quantities of chemical fertilisers, pesticides \nand herbicides \u2013 leading, in the authors\u201f terms, to a \u201ebonanza\u201f (page 33) for rice farmers. A \nfurther wave of agricultural innovations can be dated from the early 1980s when labor-saving \ntechnologies were introduced. Finally, from the beginning of the 1990s, with the stuttering \nrecovery of the Philippine economy, so non-farm opportunities proliferated. This included both \na dramatic expansion of in situ manufacturing (focused on village-based \u201ecottage industries\u201f) \nas well as a burgeoning of opportunities beyond the village. Farming households rapidly \nbecame pluriactive units of production where agriculture was one activity among several. \nThe significance of these changes for building an understanding of village livelihoods \nand patterns of poverty over time is clear in Figures 6 and 7. Figure 7 shows that over the \nperiod from 1975 land ownership in East Laguna became increasingly concentrated so that \nby the mid-1990s 20% of the population owned 99% of land.\nxvi\n Over the same period, \nhowever, the distribution of incomes remained largely unchanged with the richest 20% \nmaintaining their share at 56% (Figure 6). Clearly incomes remained skewed and village \npoverty, though it declined from close to 70% to around 56%, stubbornly high. But an agrarian \ncrisis did not materialise and to appreciate why necessitates a view of rural livelihoods in East \nLaguna that not only shifts the focus from land and agriculture to non-farm activities, but also \nfrom the village as a spatial unit to the wider geographical context. \n[Figures 6 and 7 about here] \nSo, to return to the key point of this section: how is poverty \u2013 and, by association, \nwealth \u2013 being produced and reproduced in the new Rural South exemplified by Mrs \nChandaeng, the village of East Laguna, and elsewhere? Parents are intent on providing their \nchildren with the skills and education to engage with work outside farming and beyond the \nvillage (see Rigg & Sakunee Nattapoolwat, 2001). Rather than bestowing on their children the \ninherited benefits of land parents are willing, in more than a few cases, actually to mortgage \ntheir land to find the funds so that their children can escape from farming (see Hayami & \nKikuchi, 2000: 69-70). \nHow does this, in turn, link with the discussion at the outset over \u201eold\u201f and \u201enew\u201f \npoverty? Essentially the argument offered here is that the processes that underpin the \nproduction of \u201enew\u201f poverty (broadly, the incorporation of rural communities and households \ninto the economic mainstream through market integration) offer the means by which \nindividuals and households can escape from \u201eold\u201f poverty (that arises from dependence on \ntraditional technologies, limited income, and remoteness\/dislocation from the resources of the \nstate and the market). The two are not competing conceptualisations of poverty but rather \nreflect the different ways in which poverty can be produced. Moreover it is likely that in \nindividual villages both types of poverty will co-exist. In the context of Laos I have argued that \nthere are households who are poor because of their separation from the market and the \n 12 \nfacilities of the state (old poverty), and households who are poor because they have been \ndrawn into the modernisation process on highly unfavourable terms: \u201cIn the new rural world \nbeginning to emerge in Laos some of the land poor and landless have managed to escape \npoverty through creative engagement with non-farm activities\u201d (Rigg, 2005b). Land has lost its \nstrategic role for these households and instead it is other factors and capabilities which come \ninto play: education, skills and networks, for example. \n \n(ii) The production and reproduction of poverty II \nThe discussion above glides over a question which must lie at the heart of understanding pro-\npoor (and anti-poor) growth in the countryside: How far do these new opportunities reinforce \nand accentuate old patterns of social differentiation? It may be, in other words, that rather \nthan helping to rework patterns of poverty, these new opportunities, and particularly those that \nare the most remunerative, are inaccessible to the rural poor. It is also possible, of course, \nthat these new activities may break the class envelope that formerly consigned the rural poor, \nand their descendants, to poverty (see below). \nThere is little doubt that activities with the highest potential for income generation are \nalso those with the highest barriers to entry and they, therefore, are concentrated among \nmiddle and rich rural households. At the same time, distress diversification by the rural poor \noften generates little surplus that can lift households out of their pre-ordained, inherited \nposition in the village. In this line of thinking, rather than representing a \u201ebreak\u201f with the \nestablished patterns of poverty production, the diversification of rural livelihoods has merely \nserved to widen the divide between the rural rich and the rural poor. \nIn their study of North Subang in Java, Breman and Wiradi argue that access to land \nis closely linked to access to capital; and access to capital determines the types of non-farm \nactivities that households can become involved in, and therefore the likely returns. Social \nmobility in such a context is limited (Breman & Wiradi, 2002: 51-3).\nxvii\n While geographical \nmobility increased enormously over the last two decades of the 20\nth\n century, in employment \nterms it has been quite sharply structured and has not led to a concomitant degree of social \nmobility. We have, in North Subang, diversifying and delocalising rural livelihoods but not \nones, it would seem, that have restructured patterns of poverty and prosperity. This sort of \ndevelopment has not been pro-poor and may even have been anti-poor to the degree that it \nhas widened the gulf between the poor and the non-poor.  \nThat said, even this apparently pessimistic vision of the scope for such structural \nchanges to challenge social inequalities, offers some reason for optimism. To begin with, \nwithout the growing availability of low-paying non-farm work it is hard to imagine how poor \nrural households, landless or with sub-livelihood holdings, would have managed to maintain \ntheir rural presence at all. As Deshingkar writes with reference to migration from rural areas, \n\u201cpessimistic migration analyses\u2026fail to pose the converse question of what these households \nwould have done in the absence of the opportunity to migrate\u201d (2005: 2). This point is also \npertinent to the diversification of rural livelihoods more generally. Even when livelihood \ndiversification has been based on distress diversification it has delivered an income of sorts \nand while non-farm work may not provide wages much higher than farm work (but rarely \nlower), such employment has increased the amount of work available to a poor household as \nthey creatively combine farm and non-farm. Second, there is evidence of a degree of porosity \nin the associations noted above. Poor households do, sometimes, access work which permits \na degree of wealth accumulation. The trick, in policy terms, is to ensure that this process is \nencouraged and supported. As is explained in greater detail in the conclusion, the fact that \nricher households access the better paying non-farm employment opportunities is not a \nreason to control the process as a whole, but to provide the poor with the skills and \nopportunities to lever themselves into those niches where work offers better returns. The \nexperience of countries like Malaysia demonstrates that this is possible. \nThose households being squeezed in agriculture, and experiencing what was \ndescribed as \u201eold poverty\u201f above, are provided by such diversification with the opportunity to \nsurvive in the village, if increasingly not on the land and the possibility, it is suggested here, to \nbuild new lives with higher standards of living. This is rarely neat and often uneven over time. \nBegum and Sen writing of the \u201eunsustainable\u201f livelihoods of rickshaw pullers in Dhaka, from \nthe very poorest segments of rural society, note that while this work may initially offer a route \nout of poverty and a means towards a modest degree of upward mobility, such is pullers\u201f \nvulnerability to health shocks that it is not sustainable in the long-run (Begum and Sen, 2004). \nAt the same time, remaining in farming may also lead to a stagnation or decline in livelihoods. \n 13 \nWriting of reform in China, Hy Van Luong and Unger argue that \u201cfor those families in China \nwho remained largely in agriculture, however \u2026 [their] living standards began to stagnate and \nin a great many cases declined. \u2026 Those families who were stuck entirely in farming were \nvery noticeably hurt\u201d (Hy Van Luong & Unger, 1998: 67-68).  \nAll of this assumes, of course, that maintaining some sort of presence on the land \n(and in the village), when this is combined with various non-farm pursuits, is the best way \nforward. There is reason to argue, however, that this only consigns the rural poor to \ncontinuing penury. As the concluding section of this paper briefly outlines, it may be that \npolicies should be aimed at oiling and assisting the process of transformation of farmers into \nnon-farmers, and rural people into urbanites, rather than shoring up the livelihoods of small \nholders through agricultural subsidies, land reforms and piecemeal employment creation \nschemes. This, though, is only likely to operate in a developmentally positive fashion in \ncircumstances where there is a vibrant industrial (non-farm) sector able to absorb rural \nworkers. Without such a sector, people displaced from the countryside will simply undergo a \ngeographical shift from rural to urban, while their standard of living will either remain the same \nor, possibly, decline still further. \n \n4. CONCLUSIONS: OLD QUESTIONS, NEW ANSWERS \nThe changes outlined above have, in places, fundamentally changed patterns and \nassociations regarding wealth and poverty that we have become accustomed to, and \ncomfortable with. No longer are the land rich necessarily also the prosperous in rural areas. \nNo longer can we assume that small farmers are better off than landless laborers (see L\u00f3pez \n& Vald\u00e9s, 2000 on Latin Ameirca). No longer can we state, with surety, that tenants are in a \nbetter position than owner occupiers (see Molle & Thippawal Srijantr, 1999 on Thailand). No \nlonger are agriculture and farming the desired, default position of rural households. No longer \ndo parents desire a settled, farming life for their children. And no longer should we assume \nthat agricultural development is best way to promote rural development, and rural \ndevelopment the best means of raising rural incomes and improving livelihoods (see \nDeshingkar, 2005). \nAssessing development in four villages, two in the north and two in the south of \nVietnam, Kabeer and Tran Thi Van Anh conclude: \u201c\u2026it is clear that the ability of household \nmembers, whether male or female, to diversify out of farming is a key factor in determining \nthe levels of household income and well-being\u201d and therefore, they add later \u201cto the \nachievement of economic growth, poverty reduction and social development in rural areas of \nViet Nam\u201d (2000: 30 & 35). The opening section of the paper noted the centrality of land and \nland policy in many visions of rural\/agricultural development. Griffin et al. (2002) have recently \nmade a renewed call for redistributive land reform as a means of tackling rural poverty \narguing that such reform will raise yields and agricultural output, lead to higher total factor \nproductivity, raise average incomes, narrow inequalities and, therefore, reduce poverty (see \nalso Akram-Lodhi, 2005 and Byres, 2004). In contrast to the position adopted by Griffin et al. \n(2002), this paper argues that redistributive land reform does not, in the main, offer a solution \nto rural poverty, for two reasons. First, because the nature and direction of growth is \nprogressively eroding the central role of land in rural livelihoods, as outlined above.\nxviii\n And \nsecond, because for land redistribution to have any marked effect it would have to be \nsufficiently deep to give landless rural dwellers a plot of sufficient size to sustain livelihoods at \nan acceptable level \u2013 rather than just consigning them to rural poverty, but on the land. \nFurthermore, even deep land reform may satisfy rural needs for just a generation before the \nreproduction of the household and rural population growth causes the same issues of land \nshortages and livelihood deficiencies to resurface. The politics of agrarian reform can not, in \nthe final analysis, stem the logic of economic and demographic change. This is a point that \nL\u00f3pez and Vald\u00e9s (2000: 205-6) make in their review of six Latin American countries (Chile, \nColombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Paraguay and Peru). Where such reform and resettlement \nhas been undertaken, for example in Zimbabwe, incomes on farms have stagnated and, it \nseems, \u201cmany of the opportunities opened up by Zimbabwe\u201fs first experiment with \nresettlement appear to have been exhausted\u201d (Kinsey, 2002). Even here, and dramatically so \naway from Zimbabwe\u201fs resettlement areas in the communal lands, livelihood diversification is \nmeeting a widening livelihood gap. \nThe best means of promoting pro-poor growth in the countryside may have less to do \nwith supporting small-holder farming, whether through land redistribution or policies of \nagricultural development, and more to do with endowing poor people with the skills so that \n 14 \nthey can escape from farming and, perhaps, escape from the countryside.\nxix\n Investing in \nfarming and agriculture may, indeed, preferentially support the non-poor and thereby widen \ninequalities in the countryside. This is an argument that Adams pursues in his study of Egypt \nwhere, he suggests, investing in agricultural activities will be inequality increasing because of \nthe concentration of agricultural resources (in particular, land) among a small and wealthy \nsub-set of the rural population (Adams, 2002). One can imagine a similar trajectory and \noutcome in East Laguna where agricultural investments and initiatives will benefit the minority \nof the population who have access to land (see Figure 7). \nWhere agrarian reform does lead to a redistribution of land, it may not lead to a \nconcomitant redistribution of wealth. Land owners may find it attractive to give up their land, \nparticularly when it is transferred at market value (as with market-led agrarian reform, see \nBorras 2005) and in a context where farming is losing its attractiveness, where alternative \noccupations are multiplying, and where non-farm investments yield a higher return than farm \ninvestments. In East Cirebon land sales were not always an indication of desperation but of \nrelatively wealthy households freeing up capital to invest in other activities (in this instance, in \nbrickworks) (Breman & Wiradi, 2002: 232). \nThere is, though, another way of looking at the issue, which is to re-focus the \nquestion on rural spaces, rather than on rural populations. What is the best means of \nsupporting the emergence of productive and sustainable rural spaces and rural economies? \nThis requires governments to think of farmers not as peasants, but as agrarian entrepreneurs. \nThe challenge is to ensure that those (relatively) few households who remain on the land can \nmake the transition from being peasant farmers who produce largely to meet subsistence \nneeds, to becoming commercially aware producers geared to the demands of the market. \nThis, of course, assumes out of the equation a large proportion of the current rural population \nwho could never become rural entrepreneurs because they lack the (land) resources to do so; \ntheir interests are best served by seeing rural futures as differentiated and complex with \nmultiple avenues towards achieving sustainable livelihoods that are increasingly likely to be \ndivorced, spatially and occupationally, from the land. \nTable 4 sets out three questions that lie at the heart of rural development policy in the \nRural South: \n \n Who are the rural rich and who are the rural poor? \n What is the most effective way to assist and support the livelihoods of the rural poor? \n How do we build sustainable futures in the Rural South? \n \n[Table 4 about here] \nThe table also provides the \u201eold\u201f or \u201eestablished\u201f answers to these questions and, as a way of \nconclusion, a set of \u201enew\u201f or \u201erevisionist\u201f answers. These are framed in such a way so as to \nmake clear the essence of the paper\u201fs argument. It is accepted that in reality a partial and \ngeographically fragmented process of change is underway where clear transitions from one \nset of \u201eanswers\u201f to another are unlikely. As the paper has tried to make clear, the reason why \nthese questions in certain contexts and circumstances are raising different answers is \nbecause a number of associations or links have become frayed and, in some cases, broken. \nLivelihoods have become de-linked from farming; poverty and inequality from land ownership; \nand poverty and inequality from occupation and activity. In Europe it may have taken half a \ncentury to grasp the nettle of rural development and see farming as just one of many activities \nin rural spaces. In the Rural South the luxury of such a desultory approach may not be \npossible. \n \n5. REFERENCES \nAdams, R.H. Jr. (2002). Nonfarm income, inequality, and land in rural Egypt.

This paper is an attempt to bring these ideas together in a \nrather wider consideration of the links between farming, rural development, employment diversification, \npatterns of poverty, and development interventions. \n \nii\n See, for example: Moerman 1968 and Rigg, 1995 on Thailand; Eder 1999 on the Philippines; and  \nBlaikie et al. (1980, 2001, 2002) on Nepal. \n \niii\n His study was based on an initial period of work in 1959-1960, with a follow-up visit in 1965. \n \niv\n Eder began his work in San Jose in 1970-72. Since then he has visited San Jose on six further \noccasions, in 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994-5 (see Eder 1993 and 1999). \n \nv\n Between 1966 and 1997 eleven surveys were conducted in East Laguna Village. \n \nvi\n The authors continue to depict East Laguna Village and the surrounding area as rural. \n \nvii\n These provinces being Ayutthaya, Ang Thong, Pathum Thani, Singburi, Suphanburi and Nakhon \nPathom. \n \nviii\n The number of households in the \u201eagriculture only\u201f category is the same for core and off-spring \nhouseholds (n=25). As a proportion of the total number of households in each group, however, the \nfigures are rather different: 26% for off-spring households and 40% for core households. \n \nix\n This difference may be partly due to methodological differences in the measurement of farm and non-\nfarm income but much more important is likely to be that most of the studies quoting the 40% figure are \nbased on research undertaken in the 1980s or early 1990s (Bryceson 2002: 730). \n \n 31 \n                                                                                                                                            \nx\n In 1975, in a farming population of close to 8 million, fewer than 2 million Japanese farmers were aged \nover 65 years. In 2000 the farming population has shrunk to under 4 million and those aged more than \n65 had risen to more than 2 million (Economist 2005). \n \nxi\n A topic of popular debate and concern is the difficulty male Japanese farmers have in finding a spouse \nwhen young women (particularly) are disinclined to marry a farmer. Mail order brides have been one \nway around the impasse. \n \nxii\n North Subang has been extensively studied: by Hayami and Kikuchi (1981) in the 1970s; by White \nand Wiradi (1989) in 1981; by Breman in 1990 (Breman 1995); by Pincus (1995) in 1990-91; and by \nBreman again in 1998-1999. \n \nxiii\n The best example of this in academia is the notion of the \u201emoral\u201f economy of the peasant (Scott \n1976). \n \nxiv\n This is a point that Breman and Wiradi make in the context of Java (2002: 257) as do Rigg and \nSakunee Nattapoolwat (2001) for Northern Thailand. \n \nxv\n See, for example, Blaikie et al. (1980, 2002) on Nepal; Cederroth and Gerdin (1986) and Cederroth \n(1995) on Indonesia; Molle and Thippawal Srijantr (1999) and Molle et al. (2002) on Thailand; and \nHayami and Kikuchi (2000) on the Philippines. \n \nxvi\n Ironically, this was accentuated by the land reform programme which may have helped to equalise \nland ownership among landowners but, by undermining the land rental market, made it impossible for \nthe landless to rent land and, therefore, widened inequalities (in terms of land use) within the community \nas a whole.  \n \nxvii\n Breman sharply criticises an earlier study of the same village by Hayami and Kikuchi (1981) for \nperpetuating the \u201emyth\u201f of the autonomous village as closed and inward-looking and failing to appreciate \nthe degree to which the village economy was implicated in wider networks of production and exchange. \n \nxviii\n Griffin et al. do write, in the appendix to their long paper: \u201c\u2026it should be recognised that land is not \nan equally important determinant of rural incomes in all agrarian societies. Non-farm rural activities are \n 32 \n                                                                                                                                            \nmuch more significant in some countries than in others and where this is the case, the distribution of the \nownership of land is relatively less important in determining the distribution of rural incomes\u201d (2002: \n324). A key argument of this paper is that non-farm rural activities are becoming increasingly important \ncomponents of rural incomes and livelihoods in many countries and should no longer be regarded as the \nexception to the rule.  \n \nxix\n \u201cThe realization is gradually gaining ground that to satisfy aspirations of upward mobility outside the \nvillage [of North Subang in Java] and outside agriculture requires more and different knowledge and \ntraining than can be acquired purely through experience\u201d (Breman and Wiradi 2002: 143). \n"}
