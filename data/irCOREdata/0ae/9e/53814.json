In an inclusion task, subjects attempted to complete three-letter \nword stems using previously studied words, in an exclusion task they aimed to avoid \nusing studied words to complete stems.  Patients with left TLE produced less target \ncompletions under inclusion conditions.  Completion rates were not significantly \ndifferent under exclusion conditions.  Estimates derived from process dissociation \ncalculations, confirmed that the cued recall deficit in left TLE patients arose entirely from \nimpairment in controlled memory processes.  There were no group differences in the \nestimates of automatic processes.  Recognition judgements of stems corresponding to \nstudied words did not differ between the groups.  Overall the results support the view that \ncontrolled and automatic memory processes are mediated by separable neural systems.  \nHippocampal and related structures within the left medial temporal lobe are more \nimportant than corresponding right hemisphere structures for the controlled retrieval of \nverbal material.  In contrast, the findings from this study do not suggest that the left and \nright temporal lobes make a differential contribution to automatic memory processing. \nThe theoretical and clinical relevance of these findings are discussed. \nControlled recall in TLE 3\nSince the case of H.M (Scoville & Milner, 1957), studies of patients with medial \ntemporal lobe lesions (MTL) have continued to make a significant contribution in helping \nto elucidate the neurological and cognitive bases for indirect (automatic\/implicit) and \ndirect (controlled\/explicit) forms of retrieval from long term memory (see Kopelman, \n2002 for a review).  Direct retrieval refers to a deliberate, controlled effort to recollect a \nprior event.  In contrast, indirect retrieval is revealed when prior exposure to an event \ninfluences subsequent behaviour automatically.  One of the most intriguing findings to \nemerge from these studies is that MTL patients who demonstrate impaired performance \non direct memory tasks (e.g. cued-recall), often perform within normal limits on indirect \ntasks (e.g. word stem completion), which suggests that controlled but not automatic \nretrieval is dependent upon the integrity of MTL structures. \nNumerous imaging studies have shown that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy \n(TLE) commonly present with atrophy to the hippocampus and related structures within \nthe MTL (Marsh et al., 1997), and consistent with cerebral dominance it is well \ndocumented that patients with left TLE are commonly impaired on direct verbal memory \ntasks (Naugle et al., 1993).  Although the magnitude of this impairment is modulated by a \nnumber of seizure-related factors (Hendriks et al., 2004), left TLE patients generally \nexhibit poorer direct verbal memory performance compared to neurotypical controls and \npatients with right TLE.  Because direct tests measure retrieval that is purportedly \ndeliberate and controlled, one interpretation of the verbal memory deficit in patients with \nleft TLE is that it reflects impairment in controlled uses of memory.  One problem with \nthis interpretation is that it is based on the task dissociation premise that performance \nconstitutes a process pure measure.  That is, direct tests exclusively involve controlled \nControlled recall in TLE 4\nuses of memory, whereas indirect tests exclusively involve automatic uses of memory.  \nHowever, this assumption has been vigorously contested within the context of indirect \nmemory where a number of studies have shown that contamination from controlled uses \nof memory can inflate indirect measures (Toth et al., 1994).  Contamination from \nautomatic influences on direct tests of retrieval has received much less attention (but see \nJacoby et al., 1993), although it would seem feasible that automatic facilitation is \ninstrumental in studies where memory impaired groups perform at normal or near to \nnormal level on direct tests designed to measure intentional uses of memory (Graf et al., \n1984).  Contamination confounds a clear interpretation of the direct verbal memory \ndeficit in left TLE.  Relative to right TLE, patients with left TLE may be impaired in \neither automatic or controlled memory processes, or both automatic and controlled \nmemory processing.  To date, these hypotheses remain untested, because conventional \ntask dissociation approaches to memory preclude distinguishing between controlled and \nautomatic processes since both forms of retrieval are facilitative. \nThe process-dissociation procedure is an oppositional method developed to \novercome the problem of contamination (Jacoby, 1991).  The procedure contrasts \nperformances under inclusion and exclusion conditions to derive estimates of controlled \nand automatic memory processes within the same task1.  Recently Del Vecchio et al. \n(2004) deployed the procedure to examine the contribution of controlled and automatic \nmemory processes to a cued-recall task in patients with left TLE.  In the study phase of \nthis experiment, subjects read aloud and were instructed to remember a list of target \nwords.  In the test phase three-letter word stems were completed under inclusion and then \nexclusion conditions.  For inclusion conditions the aim was to use a studied word to \nControlled recall in TLE 5\ncomplete the stem \u2013 under these instructions the probability of completing a stem with a \ntarget word is the additive probabilities of controlled (C) and automatic (A) influences of \nmemory  when recollection fails:  C + A(1 \u2013 C).  For exclusion conditions the aim was to \navoid using a studied word \u2013 under these instructions the probability of producing a target \ncompletion depends on automatic processes and the failure of controlled processes:  A(1 \n\u2013 C).   The estimates derived from the process-dissociation calculations revealed that \ncontrolled memory processing [inclusion \u2013 exclusion] was significantly greater for the \nneurotypical than for the left TLE group, whereas automatic memory processes \n[exclusion\/(1 \u2013 C)] were invariant between the two groups.   \nAlthough the process-dissociation procedure has been widely deployed to \nexamine memory processing in a number of neuropsychological groups, the method has \nattracted some debate.  A particularly pertinent issue relates to the complexity of the \ninstructions that participants are required to follow; this is argued to be particularly \nproblematic under exclusion conditions, to the extent that concerns have been raised over \nthe validity of the memory processing estimates that are derived (Graf & Komatsu, \n1994).  The present study further examines the contribution of automatic and controlled \nuses of memory to the retrieval of verbal material in left TLE.  It is a partial replication of \nDel Vecchio et al. (2004) but with two principle exceptions.  First, a guided version of \nthe process-dissociation method described by Stern et al. (2003) is used.  This procedure \nis preferred because it clearly instructs subjects how to respond according to inclusion \nand exclusion conditions through a sequence of prompts, thus eliminating the constraint \nof participants having to understand and remember a complex set of instructions2.  \nSecond, in this study left TLE patients are compared to neurotypical controls and a group \nControlled recall in TLE 6\nof TLE patients with a right seizure focus.  In contrast to neurotypical controls, left and \nright TLE patients share clinical (e.g. mood and cognitive dysfunction) and seizure-\nrelated factors (e.g. seizure type, frequency, duration, effects of medication) that are \nknown to adversely effect memory performance (Hendriks et al., 2004), therefore this \ncomparison is important in order to be confident of ascribing any observed differences in \nmemory processing to lateralization per se.     \n \nMethod \nSubjects:  Twenty four TLE patients referred by Hull and East Yorkshire Hospital \nNHS Trust to the researchers for neuropsychological assessment participated in this \nstudy.  Twelve patients had a left-sided focus and 12 had a right sided focus. Five patients \n(2 left and 3 right) had undergone an anterior temporal lobectomy, which included the \ntemporal pole, the amygdala and hippocampal structures.  The inclusion criteria for the \npatients consisted of unilateral temporal lobe seizure onset verified by MRI and EEG \nevidence of epileptiform discharges.  No patients had a history of: head trauma or \ncondition (other than relating to epilepsy) known to impair the central nervous system \nand\/or cognitive function; psychiatric diagnosis or mental illness resulting in \nhospitalization; alcohol or drug abuse.  There was no significant difference between the \nleft and right groups for age, emotional status (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, \nZigmond & Snaith, 1987) general intellect (WAIS-R, Wechsler, 1981), sustained \nattention (Information Processing Tasks A and B from the AMIPB, Coughlan & Hollows, \n1985), executive functions (Letter Fluency, Miller, 1984; Trail Making A and B, \nArmitage, 1946; Elevator Counting with Distraction from the Test of Everyday Attention, \nControlled recall in TLE 7\nRobertson et al., 1994) short-term verbal (Digit Span) and visual memory (Corsi Block \nTapping, Milner, 1971), long-term visual (Design Learning and Complex Figure from the \nAMIPB, Coughlan & Hollows, 1985) or verbal memory (RAVLT, Rey, 1964).  Ninety-\nfive percent of tests in the neuropsychological battery were completed.  A neurotypical \ncontrol group consisting of 12 people (mean age = 34, SD = 9.5; 7 female and 4 male) \nwere recruited through opportunity sampling.  All subjects participating in the study had \nnormal or corrected to normal vision and gave informed consent prior to participating in \nthe study.   \n \n[INSERT TABLE I ABOUT HERE] \n   \nStimuli:  The critical stimulus set (see Appendix A) consisted of 64 five-letter \nwords taken from Jacoby (1998); the three-letter word stem of each word was unique \nwithin the set and formed the beginning of several English words.  The number of five-\nletter word completions for the stems that have actually been given by participants in \nJacoby\u2019s studies (set size) ranged from four to nine (mean = 5.67).  This set was divided \ninto four blocks.  For any one subject, two blocks were used for each test condition.  Of \nthese, one block was studied; the other block was unstudied and was used as an index for \nbase rate completions.  The blocks were rotated to allow each word to appear in each \ncondition equally.  Each study list started and concluded with two buffer words. \n \nProcedure:  Participants were tested individually in a quiet room.  All stimuli were \nin black lowercase font, presented horizontally in the centre of a computer screen.  \nControlled recall in TLE 8\nDuring the study phase each subject was presented with 36 words (32 critical items and 4 \nbuffer words) and asked to read aloud and remember each word.  The study phase was \nuntimed but the experimenter encouraged prompt responses, as soon as a word was read \nthe Enter key was used to advance the next trial.  Each word was presented for \napproximately 2-3 seconds.  The study phase was immediately followed by the test \nphase.  In the test phase, the patients participated first under inclusion conditions; \nsecondly, under exclusion conditions.  For both inclusion and exclusion test conditions, a \nthree-letter word stem appeared on the screen immediately beneath the question, \u201cDo you \nremember seeing a word that begins like this?\u201d subjects were directed to press 1 to \nindicate \u201cYes\u201d and 2 to indicate \u201cNo\u201d.  Under both conditions, if a \u201cNo\u201d response was \ngiven the instructions, \u201cWhat word begins like this?\u201d appeared on the screen and subjects \nwere prompted to type two letters to form the first word that came to mind.  If a \u201cYes\u201d \nresponse was entered, in inclusion conditions they were asked, \u201cWhat was the word?\u201d in \nexclusion conditions they were instructed to \u201cForm a word that you haven\u2019t seen earlier\u201d.  \nThe presentation order of word stems corresponding to studied and new words was \nrandom.  The test phase was self-paced and the whole experiment took around 30 \nminutes to complete. \n \nResults \nThe proportion of target word completions was calculated for each participant \n(see Table II) and entered into separate one-way ANOVA\u2019s.  Four subjects (2 right TLE, \n1 left TLE and 1 neurotypical) who were tested obtained zero scores in the exclusion task \nand their data were not included in the analyses.  Zero scores under exclusion instructions \nControlled recall in TLE 9\nmay be indicative that subjects have used a generate-recognise retrieval strategy and \ntherefore target completions that have been automatically generated may be witheld.  If a \ngenerate-recognise strategy is adopted the process-dissociation calculations will yield \nartificially low estimates of automatic memory processes, therefore zero scores under \nexclusion conditions are commonly discarded for purposes of analyses (Jacoby, 1998).  \nThe demographic and neuropsychological characteristics of the final TLE sample can be \nfound in Table 1.  Under inclusion conditions, the performance of healthy controls and \npatients with right TLE did not significantly differ, and both groups produced a greater \nproportion of target completions than patients with left TLE [F (2, 29) = 5.696, p < .008].  \nThere were no significant differences between the groups neither for target completions \nproduced under exclusion conditions [F (2, 29) = .623, p > .543] nor for the proportion of \nbase rate completions [F (2, 29) = .177, p > .838].  Analyses of the completion rates \nacross the stimulus blocks showed no significant effect of word list neither for inclusion \n[F (3, 28) = .119, p > .948] nor exclusion conditions [F (3, 28) = 1.234, p > .316]. \nUsing the process-dissociation calculations, estimates of controlled and automatic \nprocesses were derived for each group.  Analyses of these values indicated that relative to \nhealthy controls and right TLE patients who did not significantly differ, patients with left \nTLE were impaired in deploying controlled uses of memory [F (2, 29) = 4.427, p < .02].  \nIn contrast there were no group differences for automatic influences of memory [F (2, 29) \n= .249, p > .780].  Estimates of automatic memory processes were significantly above \nbase rate [t (31) = 2.932, p < .003].  The guided procedure has the advantage of obtaining \nrecognition responses to stems prior to completion.  To examine whether the deficit in \ncued retrieval in left TLE relative to right TLE and healthy controls originated from \nControlled recall in TLE 10\nimpaired stem recognition, the proportion of hits and false alarm response were converted \ninto d\u2019 values using Macmillan and Creelman\u2019s (1991) formula.  Analysis of the d\u2019 prime \ndata failed to reveal a significant difference between the three groups. \n \n[INSERT TABLE II ABOUT HERE] \n \nDiscussion \nThis study utilised a guided process-dissociation procedure to examine the \ncontribution of controlled and automatic memory processes to a cued recall task in \npatients with TLE.  Under inclusion conditions, both healthy controls and patients with \nright TLE completed a greater proportion of stems with target words than patients with \nleft TLE.  Moreover, as indicated by the WAIS-R VIQ scores the verbal memory \nimpairment in left TLE did not arise from a deficit in verbal ability.  The estimates \nderived from the process-dissociation calculations confirmed that patients with left TLE \nwere markedly compromised in the ability to deploy controlled memory processes, \nwhereas there was no significant difference between patients with right TLE and the \ncontrol group. These findings support those of Del Vecchio et al., (2004) who reported \nthe same pattern of results in left TLE patients relative to neurotypical individuals on a \nsimilar process-dissociation task.  However, by including right TLE patients this is the \nfirst study to demonstrate that the impairment in controlled memory processing is \nspecifically related to lateralisation and not attributable to non-specific epilepsy-related \nfactors, such as an increased incidence of anxiety and depression, or the adverse effects \nof anti-epileptic medication.  Importantly, our patient groups were well matched on a \nControlled recall in TLE 11\nrange of neuropsychological measures, including; IQ, verbal fluency, attention and \nexecutive functioning.  Therefore the verbal memory deficit in left TLE patients observed \nhere is not likely to be an artefact of extraneous neurocognitive factors.  Moreover, no \nsignificant group differences were found for the proportion of correct recognition \njudgements given to stems during the test stages, which shows that the deficit in \ncontrolled uses of memory in left TLE arose from impaired retrieval per se and not from \nimpaired stem recognition.   \nStem completion under exclusion conditions is dependent upon automatic \nprocessing when recollection fails.  On this task performance was invariant between the \ncontrol and patient groups.  Irrespective of seizure focus, TLE did not reduce the ability \nto deploy automatic memory processes.  Thus, the results from the present study support \nthe view that controlled and automatic memory processes are mediated by dissociable \nneurological structures.  The integrity of hippocampal and related neural structures within \nthe left medial temporal lobe have shown to be more critical than corresponding right \nhemisphere structures for subserving controlled recollection of verbal material.  In \ncontrast, the left and right temporal lobes do not appear to differentially contribute to \nautomatic memory processing.  This view is consistent with other research (Billingsley et \nal., 2002; Zaidel et al., 1994); but these studies have deployed task dissociation \nmethodologies that can be vulnerable to contamination and therefore preclude associating \nmemory processes with subserving neural structures. \nIt should however be noted that the process-dissociation estimates can be \nsensitive to exceptionally high levels of performance and ceiling effects may lead to \naberrant conclusions.  As controlled influences of memory increase, exclusion scores \nControlled recall in TLE 12\ndecrease and if exclusion scores are equal to zero there is a danger that the contribution of \nautomatic memory processes will be underestimated.  In order to counter this potential \nconfound, we adopted procedures advocated by Jacoby (1998).  First, we selected stimuli \nthat had previously been shown to produce sufficiently high base rate completions to help \navoid zero scores in exclusion conditions.  Second, similar to other studies (e.g. \nSchmitter-Edgecombe, 1999) we excluded data from participants who nevertheless \nachieved zero scores under exclusion conditions prior to calculating the parameter \nestimates of controlled and automatic memory processing.  With these procedures, \nestimates of automatic influences of memory were found to be significantly above base \nrate.  Moreover, further support for the authenticity of our automatic memory estimates \ncan be derived from a recent review of studies that have used the process-dissociation \nprocedure (Yonelinas, 2002).  In this analysis only experiments with estimates of \ncontrolled memory processing that exceeded .60 were associated with aberrantly low \nindices of automatic influences of memory.  In the present study, each group \ndemonstrated levels of controlled memory processes below that datum.  Therefore based \non previous process-dissociation studies, our measure of automatic possessing would \nappear to be valid.        \nOne possible caveat of the experiment conducted here concerns the study phase \nprocedures.  To ensure stimulus encoding whilst allowing for possible inter-individual \nvariations in cognitive slowing arising from non-specific epilepsy-related factors we \nelected to use a presentation format that was untimed. However to ensure that the \nobserved differences in controlled memory processing are not confounded by variations \nin exposure duration, future studies may opt to control word exposure time during the \nControlled recall in TLE 13\nstudy phase.  Moreover, it has been posited that the critical factor that distinguishes \nbetween impaired and intact memory performance in TLE is the type of processing that \nthe task involves, and not whether retrieval involves controlled or automatic uses of \nmemory.  For example, Blaxton (1992) found left TLE patients showed deficits in \nconceptual processing on direct and indirect memory tests, but were unimpaired on both \ntypes of test when performance involved perceptual processing.  Whereas in contrast, \nBillingsley et al. (2002) found irrespective of processing requirements, TLE only \nproduced impairments on measures of direct memory retrieval.  Although the stem \ncompletion task used in this study involved perceptual processes, our study phase did \nafford more elaborate processing.  To speak to the processing versus systems debate more \ndirectly, it may be worthwhile for future process-dissociation studies of TLE to contrast \nthese perspectives by manipulating perceptual versus conceptual encoding at study.   \nWith the process-dissociation procedure it is possible to examine memory \nprocessing without assuming task performance represents a process pure measure, or that \npopulations with different neuropsychological profiles perform memory tasks using \nidentical forms of processing.  The standard procedure however, has been criticised \nbecause of the complexity of the instructions required and it is thought that these may be \nparticularly problematic for cognitively impaired individuals (Graf & Komatsu, 1994).  \nAlthough this confound is an obvious constraint on the clinical utility of the process-\ndissociation approach, Stern et al\u2019s (2003) guided procedure deployed in this study used a \nseries of prompts which were designed to circumvent task complexity, and we found that \nall participants were able to engage with the test procedures comprehensively.  \nNeuropsychological assessment plays a vital role in the clinical management of TLE in \nControlled recall in TLE 14\nmany areas; these include: a) aiding diagnosis (Jones-Gotman, 1992), b) the localisation \nand lateralisation of cognitive dysfunction (Jones-Gotman et al., 1993), c) evaluating the \nside effects of anti-epileptic medications (Thompson & Trimble, 1996), d) monitoring \ncognitive change (Strauss et al., 1995) and d) assessing the suitability of patients for \nepilepsy surgery and predicting post-operative outcomes (Chelune, 1995). If obtaining \nuncontaminated estimates of memory processing is considered important then the guided \nprocess-procedure may prove to be a valuable assessment tool.   \nControlled recall in TLE 15\nFOOTNOTES \n1\n The validity of the process-dissociation estimates depends on the assumption that \ncontrolled and automatic memory processes are independent.  This assumption and other \nissues of contention relating to the procedure have been debated elsewhere and will not \nbe discussed in detail here (see Reingold and Toth, 1996; Richardson-Klavehn et al., \n1996).  \n \n2 The guided procedure also encourages participants to adopt a direct retrieval strategy \nwhich is considered important for a number of key assumptions underlying the process-\ndissociation procedure to be met (see Stern et al., 2003).\nControlled recall in TLE 16\n \nTABLE I \nDemographic and neuropsychological data for patients with left or right temporal lobe \nepilepsy (omitting patients with zero exclusion scores) \nParticipant variables Left temporal lobe \n(n = 11) \nRight temporal lobe \n(n = 10) \nP < \nSex (male\/female) 5\/6 7\/3            \nHand preference \nRight\/left\/ambidextral \n \n8\/0\/3 \n \n8\/0\/2 \n \nAge 38.8 (5.4) 37.6 (9.6) 0.88 \nGeneral intellect \n  WAIS-R VIQ \n  WAIS-R PIQ \n  WAIS-R FSIQ \n \n89.0 (11.5) \n93.1 (10.8) \n89.4 (10.8) \n \n89.7 (13.1) \n87.5 (14.8) \n87.7 (13.0) \n \n0.90 \n0.34 \n0.75 \nSustained attention \n  AMIPB-Info.
