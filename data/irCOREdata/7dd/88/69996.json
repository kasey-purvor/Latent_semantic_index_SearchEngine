INTRODUCTION\nThe stationary distribution of interacting waves in an incompressible\nliquid was first described theoretically more than sixty years ago1. During\nthe last few decades nonlinear wave dynamics and wave turbulence have be-\ncame topics of intensive theoretical investigation under a variety of different\nconditions2\u20135. Theoretical models have been developed to describe diverse\nmanifestations of wave turbulence in physics, including waves on the sur-\nfaces of conventional and quantum liquids2,6,7, nonlinear waves in superfluid\nhelium8, phonon turbulence in perfect crystals9, turbulence in plasmas10,\nand turbulence in helium gas flow at high Reynolds numbers11.\nIn this paper we present and discuss some preliminary results of our on-\nPublished in J. Low Temp. Phys. 148, 251-255 (2007).\nV.B. Efimov, et. al\ngoing investigations of acoustic turbulence in a system of nonlinear second\nsound waves in a high-quality resonator filled with superfluid 4He. Important\nfeatures of this system are its linear dispersion law for the wave spectrum\n\u03c9k = u20 k, the large nonlinear coefficient\n12 of the second sound velocity\nu2(\u03b4T ) = u20+\u03b12\u00d7\u03b4T as a function of its temperature excursions \u03b4T , and the\nlow dissipation in the second sound waves. The nonlinearity coefficient \u03b12 of\nroton second sound changes from \u2212\u221e at T\u03bb to a large positive value (\u03b12 \u2248 2\nK\u22121 at T = 1.5 K) within the experimentally convenient temperature range\n1.5 < T < 2.17 K. Furthermore, \u03b12 passes through zero at T\u03b1 = 1.88 K,\nallowing us to identify unambiguously the effects of the nonlinearity. Thus,\nat temperatures T 6= T\u03b1, a propagating second sound pulse with \u03b4T \u223c 1 mK\ntransforms to a triangle with a shock (temperature discontinuity) formed at\nthe front of the pulse if T < T\u03b1, or at the trailing edge of the pulse if T > T\u03b1\nat a distance \u223c 1 cm from the second sound generator13 e.g. a thin-film\nheater).\nFor second sound waves in a high-Q resonator the amplitude of a stand-\ning wave should be Q times higher than the amplitude of the initial wave\ngenerated by a heater, due to resonant amplification. Except at very small\ndriving amplitudes, therefore, we may expect a large Q to be associated with\nthe distortion of initially harmonic waves, and in the appearance of multiple\nharmonics due to nonlinearity. At sufficiently high \u03b12, this will occur even\nfor relatively small generator powers. We show below that this leads to the\nformation of a Kolmogorov-like cascade of second sound standing waves over\nthe frequency range 1\u2013100 kHz.\n2. EXPERIMENTS\nThe resonator8,14 was formed from a cylindrical quartz tube length\nL = 7 cm, diameter D = 1.5 cm, capped by a pair of parallel flat glass\nplates that carried the bolometer and heater. The sensitivity of the Sn-Cu\nbolometer15 lay in the range 1.2\u20132.6 V\/K for temperatures T = 1.79\u22122.08 K,\nand could be shifted to its optimal sensitivity by an external magnetic field.\nThe bolometer signal was amplified, digitized by an analog-to-digital con-\nverter, and subsequently analyzed. The second sound waves were generated\nby a heater connected to a sinewave generator. The frequency fd of the tem-\nperature waves from the heater (at twice the generator frequency fg) could\nbe varied within the range 50 Hz\u201350 kHz. The ac heat flux radiated by the\nheater lay in the range 1 < W < 50 mW\/cm2.\nIn a linear approximation the resonant frequency for longitudinal modes\nin a resonator can be written as f(p) = 1\/2\u00d7 c20 \u00d7 p\/L, where p \u2265 1 is the\nNonlinear Second Sound Waves\n0 1 2 3\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n0 1 2 3\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nUg , V \nA\nB\n, a\nrb\n.v\nal\n.\nUg , V \nT=1.767 K, 11 Resonance,  fd~1478 Hz\na)\nW~6 mW\/cm2\n A\nB\n1\/\n2\nb)\nFig. 1.

The Q-factor of the resonator for resonant\nmodes p \u2265 9 lies in the range 1000 < Q < 7000. At sufficiently small W the\namplitude AB \u221d \u03b4T of the standing wave should be given by\nAB \u221dW \u221d U2g\nwhere Ug is the voltage of the sinusoidal wave applied to the heater.\nThis relationship was indeed observed for small enough applied signals\n(W < 5 mW\/cm2), as shown in Fig. 1b. Increase of the excitation above\n\u223c 5 mW\/cm2 led to deviations from the line \u221aAB \u221d Ug, and the results are\nthen better described by AB \u221d Ug (Fig. 1a). Attenuation of second sound\nwaves by quantized vortexes created by the second sound heat flux can be\nshown to be small under the conditions of our measurements (heat flux den-\nsity W < 50 mW\/cm2). Thus nonlinearity and viscous attenuation of sound\nplay central roles in the dynamics of waves in the high-Q resonator. The\nleak of energy away from the driving frequency is accompanied by visible\ndeformation of the initially sinusoidal temperature wave, due to the non-\nlinearity. It is this steepening of the harmonic wave that accounts for the\nmultiple harmonics formed in its spectrum (Fig. 2) and for the transforma-\ntion of energy from fd to higher f . For larger W > Wc, the observed strong\nV.B. Efimov, et. al\nFig. 2.

The full line corresponds to a power-\nlaw dependence of the peak height Af \u221d f\u2212m, where m = 1.6. It follows\nfrom theoretical analysis4 and numerical estimation16 that the exponent m\nfor developed acoustic turbulence (with a Kolmogorov-like cascade) should\nbe close to unity. Our experimental data for the fully developed cascade,\nobtained at different temperatures and driving frequencies, yields a power-\nlaw dependence with m = 1.5\u00b1 0.3.\nIn measurements at higher resonant modes we were able to observe the\neffect of the high frequency edge of Kolmogorov\u2019s spectrum as an abrupt\nNonlinear Second Sound Waves\n0 20000 40000 60000 80000\n1E-5\n1E-4\n1E-3\n0.01\n1000 10000 100000\n1E-5\n1E-4\n1E-3\n0.01\nfc ~ 20 kHz\nA~exp(-0.2*N)\nFrequency, Hz\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\nA~f -3.5\nA~f -1.6\n \n \nFig. 3.

CONCLUSIONS\nBy investigation of large-amplitude second sound in a high-Q resonator\nwe have shown that the standing wave system exhibits a nonequlibrium\nV.B.

We infer\nthat, for T 6= T\u03b1, fully-developed acoustic turbulence (a Kolmogorov-like\ncascade) can be formed, with energy flowing continuously from the lower\n(driving) frequency domain to the high frequency (damping) domain.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe investigations were supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic\nResearch, projects Nos. 05-02-17849 and 06-02-17253, by the Presidium of\nthe Russian Academy of Sciences within the programs \u201cQuantum Macro-\nphysics\u201d and \u201cMathematical Methods in Nonlinear Dynamics\u201d, and by the\nEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (UK).\nREFERENCES\n1.
