This may\nstem from the abstract and complex nature of many learning models. In order to address this problem,\nthere is a need for simplified models of learning which include guidelines indicating how such models\ncan be implemented in courseware design. This paper identifies such a model, and presents a series of\nguidelines intended to enable courseware designers to apply educational theory to the practical design\nof quality computer-based learning materials.\nThe 'spreading ripples' model of learning\nThe model of learning adopted within this paper is the 'spreading ripples' (SR) model\nproposed by Race (1994). This model was chosen for two important reasons. First, it\nmakes use of accessible ideas and language, .and is therefore simple. Second, .Race\nsuggests that the model can be used in the design, of educational and training programmes\n(and can thereby be applied to the design of computer-based learning materials).\nThere are four key terms central to the SR model: Wanting, Doing, Feedback and Digesting.\nWanting. Race uses the term wanting in place of the term motivation which is more, often\nused by psychologists. He argues that wanting implies much more than motivation since it\nlies at the centre of 'human urges'. When individuals attempt to learn, and are also highly\nmotivated, excellent results are often possible. However, when wanting is lacking it is\nunlikely that efficient learning will take place.\nDoing. When individuals are asked how they learn, very few refer to being taught or\ntrained. Most refer insteadto the process of 'doing' in some form or other. Race sums up\nthese responses into four statements of active learning: practice, doing, trial and error and\nlearning from mistakes. Here the emphasis is firmly on the activity of the learner.\nFeedback. An important issue in all human behaviour, including learning, relates to\n17\nStephen Richards Educational software design: applying models of learning\nfeelings (Mueller, 1975). When individuals have positive feelings, they are likely to be\ncapable of more effective learning- an issue often overlooked by learning theorists (Race,\n1994). It is therefore important to understand how people most frequently obtain positive\nfeelings about their behaviour so that attempts can be made to produce the same positive\nfeelings when they are involved in learning behaviours. When individuals are asked about\nwhere they obtain positive feelings from, a typical pattern of responses emerges. Few\nclaim that the feelings come from within; most obtain their positive feelings from the\ncomments made about their behaviour by others. In other words, people need feedback\nabout their behaviour in order to feel good about it. Feedback is therefore an important\nmechanism by which positive feelings towards learning processes can be engendered.\nDigesting. When discussing the processes that learners undergo in order to make sense of\nnew information, educational psychologists often use terms such as reflection and\nreflective observation (Kolb, 1984). The term digesting is used by Race as an everyday\nalternative to these terms. For effective learning to take place, the learner must not only\ntake in new information, but must also sort out what the important points were and\nextract or formulate any underlying principles that may exist. It is only by actively\nprocessing information in the context of previous knowledge that the new information\ncan be effectively assimilated.\nGuidelines for designers\nFrom all this, eight guidelines can be produced, two for each of the learning processes\nidentified by the model.\nWanting guidelines \/\n1. Wanting must be consciously programmed into courseware.\nAn assumption often made in higher education is that students already possess the\nwanting, and that this is evident simply by virtue of the fact that they are undertaking\nadvanced education as a matter of choice. In reality, wanting is often lacking for some\nstudents. If motivational issues are not addressed directly, some will fail to make\nadequate use of the learning materials provided.\n2. Two basic ways exist for embedding wanting: increased value and increased enjoyment.\nWithin all areas of learning, there are aspects of the subject matter that students will find\nuninteresting, and others that they will find enthralling. Unfortunately, although trends\ncan be identified, the areas in which students are intrinsically motivated vary from one\nstudent to another. For this reason, it is important to provide embedded motivation.\nIncreased value can provide that motivation by showing students the purpose of studying\neach aspect of a course, and also a schema of how the various aspects of the course link\ntogether. In this way, topics are no longer seen as isolated items, and the value placed on\neach topic by students can be increased. Motivation can also be increased by trying to\npresent the learning in a more enjoyable format. This can be achieved in a number of\nways, including the use of multimedia and the use of game-playing strategies. Extreme\ncare must be taken, however, not unnecessarily to embed expensive multimedia resources\nonto trivialize the learning experience by an inappropriate use of the game approach.\n18\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 3\nDoing guidelines\n1. Avoid passive interaction.\nA problem found in many computer-based learning applications is a reliance on the\nrelatively passive interaction involved in page turning. Here the user is not interacting\nwith the information in any meaningful sense. Instead, the user's primary task becomes\nthe monotonous and repeated selection of a 'next-page' icon. Interestingly, it seems to be\na particular problem in those applications which use digital video as an information-\npresentation medium. It seems that the inclusion of high-cost video resources, which\nimprove the aesthetic appearance of learning products, has led to a de-emphasis of the\nlearning design. A return to more meaningful interactions that stimulate active thinking\nprocesses is required (for example, investigating interrelationships between concepts, and\ncontrolling simulations).\nl.^Support practice and\/or trial-and-error learning.\nWhen people are asked how they learned to do something which they are good at, their\nmost common responses centre on the terms practice and trial and error.People seem to\nlearn most effectively by doing something over and over again. Each time they make a\nmistake, the error is recorded and attempts are made to avoid making the same error\nagain. In order to produce effective computer-based learning products, this capacity to\nprovide students with the opportunities to practice new skills or knowledge, to make\nmistakes and correct their errors, is crucial.\nFeedback guidelines\n1. Provide students with a sense of progression.\nIn order for students to improve their skills or knowledge, they must have some sense of\ntheir progression. They must be able to see the improvements that are being achieved and\ncompare those achievements with their own progression up a particular learning step. In\nterms of computer-based education, this means that the scope of the learning target\nshould always be readily available. A problem encountered in many hypermedia learning\njjroduclsis^hat the scope of the learning is never clearly available to students. This means\nthat-they-are- often-unable to see how they are progressing with regard to the learning\ngoals, and may rapidly lose interest because there is no way of assessing their direction or\nachievement. This can be remedied by providing students with a clear idea of the scope of\nthe learning objectives. Students should also be provided with the means to assess their\nown progress through appropriate feedback.\n2. Encourage use within a social context.\nThe impact of both teacher and peer feedback is often much more powerful than that\nautomatically generated by the computer. As a result, it is important that learning\nsoftware is designed so that advantage can be taken of use within a social context (for\nexample, with friends, in a classroom, or even in a remote or virtual class). In such social\ncontexts, students are able to obtain personal feedback with respect to their progress.\nSuch feedback als\\j has the advantage that it can be targeted specifically at individuals,\ntaking into consideration individual personalities, abilities and expectations.\n19\nStephen Richards Educational software design: applying models of learning\nDigesting guidelines\n1. Embed computer-based student evaluation.\nIn order to assimilate new information, students must undergo a process of making sense\nof new material in relation to their existing knowledge. This is a process that can be\nencouraged by providing an environment in which students are required to think about\nthe materials they are learning. Perhaps the simplest way of achieving this in computer-\nbased learning applications is through the embedding of appropriate evaluation\ntechniques. Such evaluations must be designed to cause students to analyse the concepts\nor information delivered, and then link the material together in new ways. This process\ncauses the student actively to digest what has been learned, rather than simply trying to\nreproduce the delivered information without considering meaning.\n2. Encourage reflection away from the computer environment.\nAs already mentioned, learning tends to take place most effectively within a social (rather\nthan a purely computer-based) environment. Just as feedback can be obtained through\nmechanisms outside the computer environment, so too can digesting take place away from\nthe machine. There are several ways in which this can be achieved. The most obvious way is\nto encourage students to undertake tasks away from the computer which involve them in\ntrying to apply the concepts or information they have been exposed to in the computer-\nbased environment. Such tasks can also encourage the use of team work or discussion\ngroups which provide the social context in which digesting can take place most effectively.\nConclusion\nThe guidelines outlined in this paper are intended to be used by designers in the practical\ndevelopment of courseware. Such work has already been undertaken in one project which\nis targeted at teaching undergraduate psychology (Richards, 1996). Preliminary findings\nhave shown that the guidelines are useful (from the developer's perspective), and that they\nlead to the production of effective learning materials (from the student's perspective). The\nwider practical application of Race's model should lead courseware engineers to\nreconsider the importance of educational theory in the design of effective computer-based\nlearning packages.\nReferences\nKolb, D.
