Local \ngovernment research has mostly focussed on political and institutional changes at the local level. \nThe aim of this article is to set out a future research agenda on central-local relations which \nrecognises how the spread of new \u201egovernance\u201f arrangements has changed those relations and how \ninsights from the governance literature can shed light on those relations. The article stresses the need \n(1) to understand local policy processes and outcomes within the context of a wide range of non-\nlocal factors and actors, and (2) how those processes and outcomes have changed as governance \narrangements have grown in significance. The contemporary politics of the welfare state involve \nboth a greater central reliance on governance arrangements but also a rejection of the formerly \nhighly institutionalised national local government system, dominated by service-based policy \ncommunities. Instead, the national-level policy processes now involve more diverse types of actors \nand, in many cases, cut across service-based boundaries. The key question is the extent to which \nthese changes have modified the policy systems within which local government is embedded and \nwhether they are more pluralistic or open than the old policy communities which once dominated \nlocal government policy-making at the centre.  \n \nIntroduction \n \nOver recent years central-local relations has been a neglected topic for research in England. Local \ngovernment research has mostly focussed on political and institutional changes at the local level. A \ngreat deal is now known about the impact locally of the present Labour government\u201fs reforms with \nextensive research findings covering reforms such as the promotion of a mixed economy of service \ndelivery, Best Value and subsequent performance management frameworks, the working of \npartnerships and the modernisation of local government policy-making processes. These research \nfindings incidentally provide many insights into central-local relations. But many pressing questions \nremain unanswered \u2013 how are local interests represented at the national level? what are the origins of \ncentral policies behind local policy outcomes? how do actors at the various levels of government, \nand in political party and policy networks, make the system work for them? The aim of this article is \nto place these and related questions at the heart of a new central-local relations research agenda. \n \n\u201eCentral-local relations\u201f is defined here broadly to include not just the direct governmental relations \nbetween central departments and local authorities, but also those interactions involving non-\ngovernmental actors from both the central and local levels as well as the national-level world of local \ngovernance. This article, then, is based on two assumptions. Firstly, local policy outcomes and \nprocesses have to be understood not just in terms of local factors but also as conditioned by national \npolicy settings. Secondly, any contemporary analysis of central-local relations must reflect the move \nfrom an era of \u201egovernment\u201f to one of \u201egovernance\u201f (Richards and Smith 2002: 15). \u201eGovernance\u201f is \nan overused term with a wide range of meanings (Rhodes 2000, Stoker 1998; Kjaer 2004), however \nno obvious word quite captures the changes stressed in this article. \u201eGovernance\u201f then refers here to \ntwo main changes in the service delivery structures relating to government. (1) The structures of \npublic policy making and delivery have become more complex and multi-organisational \u2013 as \n 2 \nopposed to the structures which delivered the post-war welfare state, particularly in Britain, which \nwere a series of large bureaucracies; As Richards and Smith (2002: 279) note \u201eit is not what the state \ndoes that is different, it is how it does it\u201f. (2) non-governmental actors are playing a significant role \nin, at least, the delivery of policy and possibly in the formation of that policy. These non-\ngovernmental actors refer to those from appointed bodies, partnerships and alternative service \ndelivers in the voluntary and private sectors. These changed structures and the involvement of non-\ngovernmental actors have three crucial implications.  \n \n(1) Those in formal policy-making roles, insofar as their policy objectives require the compliance of \ndisparate actors, have to develop new strategies to manage and coordinate policy with actors who are \nnow outside the usual governmental chains of command. What strategies do the formal policy-\nmakers adopt to manage under these changed circumstances? Do central policy-makers, in central \nagencies and departments, have the capacity and competencies to manage more complex and \ndisaggregated public service delivery structures? In what ways, do locally-based governmental \nactors respond to these efforts by central management? Do governance structures offer them new \nopportunities to defend their discretion or work to influence policy at the centre?  \n \n(2) Non-governmental actors have their own objectives which may not be consonant with those of \nthe governmental actors \u2013 how do they accommodate themselves to working for government? do \nthey seek ways of influencing policy at the local or central levels?  \n \n(3) The increasingly complex relationships within policy delivery structures, and the involvement of \nnon-governmental actors, raise questions of democratic accountability and legitimacy. These \ncomplex relationships and diverse actors complicate the identification of who does what and, thus, \nwho should be held accountable? how are non-governmental actors held accountable outside the \ntraditional lines of democratic accountability? and on what authority do these actors take, or \nparticipate, in decisions relating to their fellow citizens? \n \nCentral-local relations, as defined here, offers a major arena within which these questions can be \ninvestigated and hypotheses arising from the debate over governance can be tested out and refined. \nThat debate is plagued by definitional wrangles and many compelling, if sometimes poorly-based, \ngeneralisations about the direction of change. Thus a pressing need exists for more research to chart \nhow far governance arrangements have displaced direct government, under what circumstances and \nwith what consequences for our understanding of contemporary policy structures and their \nimplications for democratic accountability. Not least a historical perspective is necessary if \ngovernance trends are to be properly understood. Any analysis of central-local relations in the new \nworld of governance has to start from the identification of two views or interpretations of the \nconsequences of governance in Britain \u2013 the weak centre versus the strong centre view. Rhodes \n(1996: 667) is the main advocate for the weak centre or \u201ehollow government\u201f thesis in the UK. He \nproposes that the state is becoming \u201ea collection of inter-organisational networks made up of \ngovernmental and societal actors with no sovereign actor being able to steer or regulate\u201f. Thus \ncentral government has lost control to a range of \u201epolicy networks\u201f which have acquired \u201eself-\norganising\u201f capacities and resist central direction. In other words, \u201einstitutional differentiation and \npluralisation in British government \u2026 erodes the capacity of the core executive to steer\u201f. The \nproponents of a strong centre contest this thesis. They argue that central government remains pre-\neminent with the very process of institutional differentiation actually enhancing the power of the \ncentre. Thus central actors can retain a monopoly over the overall governmental direction precisely \nthrough a divide-and-rule strategy made possible by the disaggregated nature of contemporary \nBritish government. \u201eThe state may be relinquishing direct control, but in doing so, it is attempting \nto purchase wider effective control. In short,  it is attempting to buy new governing capacity in the \n 3 \nlocality\u201f (Davies, 2002: 315; see also Saward 1997; Taylor 2000; Bache 2003). Marsh et al.\u201fs (2001, \n2003) research, too, on central departments has led them to propose an \u201easymmetric power\u201f model \nwhich stresses the continued pre-eminence of central departments. \n \nThe notion of multi-level governance introduces another dimension to the governance debate. Multi-\nlevel governance is a \u201esystem of continuous negotiation among nested governments at several \nterritorial tiers\u201f (Marks 1993: 392 quoted in Bache and Flinders 2004: 3). Marks introduced the term \nto capture the European dimension to national and local government in the administration of \nEuropean Union (EU) structural funds. It encompasses claims about the increased interdependence \nof governments at the various territorial levels in Europe and between governments and non-\ngovernmental actors at those levels (Bache and Flinders 2004: 3). Not least, multi-level governance \nimplies a decline in the autonomy of nation-state governments, while the European and subnational \nlevels have gained increased responsibilities. However, as Bache (2004) concludes, the evidence for \nsuch a decline in England is limited even in the area of EU regional policy \u2013 central government \nretains a tight control over EU funding flows to the regional and local levels, while English local \nauthorities have seen their discretion curtailed not enhanced. Nevertheless, the multi-level \ngovernance perspective underlines the point that central-local relations can be understood as an \narena in which many actors behave strategically within a system which offers a range of possible \nlocations to pursue their objectives.  \n \nThe next section examines how and why a era of governance has emerged in Britain through a \ncompressed history of the last sixty years. It argues that central-local relations must be understood \nwithin the changing politics of the welfare state, in particular the changing context of public \nspending expansions and contractions.  \n \nThe Changing Role of Local Government in the Welfare State  \n \nBritish local authorities deliver major welfare state services in education and social services, and are \nresponsible for about a quarter of all public spending. Inevitably, then, central policy makers take a \nstrong interest in local government expenditure and have always sought to manage the politics and \npolicy of the locality. The crucial point is that they have done so in different ways at different times. \nThus central-local relations is more than a simple story of central encroachment on local autonomy \nand must be understood as shaped by changing approaches towards the management and control of \nthe devolved welfare state. Those relations, and the variations in local government powers and \nresponsibilities across time, have to be understood within the context of the changing politics of the \nwelfare state. In Britain those changing politics can be very roughly identified as three periods in the \ndevelopment of the post-war welfare state: (1) the immediate post-war welfare state expansion until \nthe late 1970s; (2) retrenchment or austerity until 1997; and (3) the second post-war period of \nexpansion or welfare state renewal after 1997.  \n \nThe first period, a \u201egolden age\u201f of public service expansion, was one of broad inter-party and inter-\ngovernmental consensus on welfare state expansion. The growth of the welfare state, and the \nexpansion of local government to deliver major high spending public services (education, social \nservices, housing etc.), inevitably drew the national political parties into strengthening their presence \nin local authorities. National and local politicians defined their role as overseeing the expansion of \nthe local welfare state and claiming the credit for its achievements, while the public service \nprofessions acquired a key role in a high-discretion welfare state which allowed them considerable \ninfluence in policy formulation (Goldsmith and Page 1987). Central government set the overall \ndirection of the welfare state but with the public service professionals largely entrusted with the \nmore detailed development and expansion of public services. The assumption was that those services \n 4 \nwere best delivered through professionalized bureaucracies. For the professions had long seen by \nreformers at the centre, since the mid nineteenth century, as a countervailing force to the undesirable \npull of local interests and politics (Laffin 1986). The professions came to be a major source of policy \ninitiatives and exercised considerable influence over the formation of policy, both nationally and \nlocally, and thus were an important part of the explanation of the policy similarities across the \ncountry (Dunleavy 1980; Laffin 1986). Thus both \u201epartisanisation\u201f (i.e. electors voting locally on \nnational issues, councillors implementing national party programmes locally) and professionalisation \nled to a nationalisation of local policy across local authorities.  \n \nA \u201enational community of local government\u201f (Rhodes 1986), then, developed as a stable, highly \ninstitutionalised, set of relationships between central departments and the national-level local \nauthority associations, and those departments and the profession-dominated policy communities. \nSimilarly, Dunleavy (1981: 123) identified a \u201enational local government system\u201f as \u201ethe complex \nweb of inter-authority and supra-authority relations which can exert a strong influence\u201f on policies \npursued by individual councils. This national local government system largely set \u201ethe parameters \nwithin which local authorities operate\u201f. The then \u201epolicy-making map\u201f was a \u201eseries of vertical \ncompartments inhabited by a different set of organised groups and generally impenetrable by \n\u201cunrecognised groups\u201d or by the general public\u201f (Richardson and Jordan 1979: 74). Despite the \nexistence of three main local authority associations, in practice the agendas for the major public \nservices were largely set by professionalised policy communities (Laffin 1986; Rhodes 1986), \nalthough even then housing management proved an exceptional case (Laffin 1986). The public \nservice professions exercised considerable influence through the \u201epolicy communities\u201f \u2013 defined \nhere as closed networks, with a high degree of internal consensus and including central and local \ngovernment professionals (Richardson and Jordan 1979; Laffin 1986). Meanwhile, these policy \ncommunities enjoyed considerable influence within the central departments. Notably, in the late \n1970s the then Labour government sought to re-assert its control over these service-based \ncommunities to dampen down their upward influence on public expenditure by encouraging the \ncountervailing, \u201etopocratic\u201f or place-based power of treasurers and chief executives (Rhodes 1986: \n376).  \n \nThe second period, from the late 1970s, was characterised by a search for welfare state retrenchment. \nRetrenchment poses qualitatively different problems of political and bureaucratic management \ncompared with those of welfare state expansion (Pierson, 1996). Austerity proved difficult in \npolitical terms \u2013 avoiding the blame for cuts, both apparent and real, and the consequent electoral \nfall-out \u2013 and in practical policy terms \u2013 how to cut back in an orderly fashion without creating \nmajor service delivery failures. The politics of austerity, which began under Labour in the late 1970s \nand intensified under the Conservatives during the 1980s, involved tighter financial and other \ncontrols plus a rejection of the service profession-driven local government model. Labour local \ngovernment resisted central cutbacks, especially the imposition of \u201erate-capping\u201f (direct control over \nthe ability of local authorities to raise local rates) and sought to act as a break on central \nretrenchment. Many local authorities, driven more by partisan than territorial loyalties, directly \nchallenged central government policy to a historically unprecedented degree (Lansley et al. 1989; \nGyford 1985). The polarised politics of the 1980s also encouraged the Conservative centre to seek \ngreater direct control over local government and use real or apparent abuses of power by certain \nLabour, \u201eloony-left\u201f local authorities to discredit Labour as an alternative government (Lansley et al. \n1989: 174; Entwistle and Laffin 2005). Conservative ministers ceased to rely on the more indirect \nsteering of local policy via the professions, associated with the period of expansion, and sought more \ndirect controls over authorities through a raft of initiatives like compulsory competitive tendering, \nperformance reviews, nationalised the business rate, rate-capping and (least successfully) the poll tax \n(Butler et al. 1994). The other key feature was the introduction of new inspectorates and the reform \n 5 \nof existing inspectorates to tighten control. In particular, the Audit Commission was formed in 1983 \nand Ofsted was created out of the HM Inspectorate of Schools in 1992 to reflect better Conservative \nvalues and drive change in schools (Lee and Fitz 1997). Conservatives ministers also sought to \nmanage local policy to ensure that their objectives were realised by working around local authorities \nthrough a wide range of new appointed bodies and self-governing agencies (Skelcher 1998: 50), thus \nlaying the foundations of \u201egovernance\u201f. Similarly, they began to involve non-governmental actors \nfrom within the voluntary sector more extensively to deliver services: \u201eThe voluntary sector \nprovided central government with the means to disempower local authorities in the housing field, \nand to broaden its own ambit of influence through the development of a tight regulatory regime\u201f \n(Kendall & Knapp, 1996: 160) (thus leading to the establishment of a vertical policy linkage separate \nfrom the central-local government relationship in housing).  \n \nThe third period, following Labour\u201fs election in 1997, saw a return to welfare state expansion or, \ngiven its more modest scale compared with the earlier period, welfare state renewal. Labour \nministers have not returned to the high-discretion welfare state model. Ministers are acutely aware of \nhow critical local government performance is to achieving public service reform (Stoker 2004). \nConsequently, the strategy has involved an elaboration of direct controls over local authorities \nthrough the various tools of contemporary performance management \u2013 targets, inspectorates and so \nforth. They have not reinstated the old style of consultative processes with profession-dominated \npolicy communities. The professions no longer enjoy easy access to central departments: \u201eIn the \ncurrent political environment the ability to reframe problems, draw on international lessons and \ndeliver change is more important than an expertise rooted in existing practice\u201f (Laffin & Entwistle, \n2000: 214). Labour ministers, as did their Conservative predecessors, look to more heterogeneous \nsources of advice and ideas beyond the civil service and the professions. Such sources include \nthinktanks, management consultants, voluntary organisations, interest groups and inspectorates for \nadvice and policy ideas. Tellingly, the changed ministerial expectations and a more competitive \npolicy environment have compelled the Local Government Association leadership to adopt a more \nflexible organisation form and employ policy generalists rather than the traditional professionals \n(Entwistle & Laffin, 2003). By the same token senior civil servants report that they do not enjoy a \nmonopoly on policy advice to ministers (Richards 2008). Indeed the Westminster Labour leadership \nhad already carefully crafted policies before 1997, drawing on expertise outside the traditional \nconsultative channels, intended to limit the influence of the unions in local authorities (Entwistle & \nLaffin 2005). These policies later evolved into a Labour modernisation strategy of imposing a \ntightly-controlled, target-driven model on the public services. This model has involved constraints \non local government discretion as well as on the power of the professions and unions. The view from \nthe Prime Minister\u201fs Office and Treasury is that any additional spending must be seen to deliver \nbetter public services if public services are to win sufficient electoral support to sustain them and the \nNew Labour project.  \n \nUnder Labour the disaggregration of the public services, into a wide range of appointed bodies and \npartnerships, has continued. Labour ministers have celebrated the potential of networks, partnerships \nand market-type relationships as mechanisms of coordination as opposed to the Old Labour \nmechanisms of big bureaucracy and centralised rules (Richards 2008: 47). They have also stressed \nthat contemporary social problems no longer correspond to neat professional or departmental \nboundaries but \u201ecross-cut\u201f these boundaries and thus require multi-agency rather than a single \nagency response. Even within local authorities themselves the old, profession-focussed departments \nare being transformed into multi-disciplinary and problem-focussed organisation in which traditional \nprofessional competences and commitments are losing their status \n \nThe Contemporary World of Central-Local Relations \n 6 \n \nThis sketchy history shows how the politics of party and of the welfare state have long over-ridden \nthe politics of the locality and, moreover, how the role of these politics has promoted the shift \ntowards a greater reliance on governance arrangements. Both Conservative and Labour ministers \nconcluded that their role was weakened, it might even be said to have been \u201ehollowed-out\u201f by the \nexistence of these powerful policy communities which they have, consequently, dislodged. Crucially \nthe party has been the source and instrument of change as Gyford (1986: 139) observes: \u201eIf the \nprofessional-bureaucratic complexes described here as policy communities are a source of \ninstitutional inertia, the parties are a source of change\u201f. Consequently, the pattern of profession-\ndominated policy communities occupying a distinct policy sector has largely passed into history. The \nspread of governance arrangements has created, or strengthened existing, non-governmental linkages \nbetween the centre and the locality outside the formal central-local government channels. A \ndistinction is made here between \u201elinkages\u201f which refer to the vertical channels of central-local \nrelations and \u201epolicy networks\u201f which refer to a collection of interest groups, officials and others \nwith an interest in a particular policy area acting at the national level; while a \u201epolicy community\u201f is \na closed policy network which is more difficult to join, whose members control the criteria for \nmembership and have considerable shared values and views. Linkages and networks, as defined \nhere, perform different functions but are likely to have some overlapping membership and, as \nstressed earlier, some actors use these structures strategically to pursue their own objectives. The \nproliferation of central-local linkages, characteristic of governance, is relevant to whether central \ngovernment is emerging as a strong centre or as a weak\/hollowed-out government. This question \nrelates to the extent of (1) central government\u201fs steering capacity over local authorities and the \ncentral-local linkages as well as over the national-level policy networks; (2) the influence of those \npolicy networks and communities over central government policy; and (3) locally-based actors\u201f \ncapacity to achieve their own objectives and defend their discretion.  \n \nCentral Government in the World of Central-Local Relations \n \nAny examination of central government\u201fs steering and control capacities have to recognise the \nchanged dynamics within central government. An historic shift has taken place towards the \u201ecore \nexecutive\u201f of No. 10, the Treasury and Cabinet Office and away from the Whitehall departments. In \nparticular, the policy initiative in many key areas has shifted to No. 10 and the Treasury. The \nCabinet Office has also acquired a strong policy and management monitoring, or even enforcement \nrole, in relation to the departments, reflecting the stress on improving service delivery (Fawcett and \nRhodes 2007: 84). Under Blair political appointees have driven many of the emblematic Blairite \npolicy ideas, for example Andrew Adonis (now Lord Adonis) has driven major aspects of school \nreforms. Labour ministers have added their own policy initiatives to the policy brew, leaving local \ngovernment members and officers, as well as people elsewhere in the public services, to respond to a \nwide range of new policy initiatives. Those ministers in the big service departments have added to \nlocal government controls by demanding that funding should be funnelled through specific funding \nstreams. Central government funding has moved towards the greater use of specific grants, specific \ncentral government grants increased from 15 to 26 per cent of total central grants between 1999-\n2000 and 2003-04 (Laffin 2007: 78), and this was before school funding was ring-fenced.   \n \nMeanwhile, the Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG) (and its three earlier \ndepartmental incarnations since 1997) has struggled to define and defend a role for itself in the face \nof powerful service departments \u2013 is it a coordinating department vis-\u00e0-vis the big Whitehall service \ndepartments or the local government sponsoring department? The CLG Permanent Secretary\u201fs \nresponse to the CLG Capability review proposing \u201edelivery agreements with key government \ndepartments within the next six months, which establish a shared view of the priority tasks we need \n 7 \nto deliver together\u201f (Cabinet Office 2006: 6). In other words, the CLG is attempting to promote a \nmore coherent approach towards local government across Whitehall departments. Ruth Kelly, the \nthen Minister for Communities and Local Government, acknowledges the issue and herself sets out \nthe key research question on the Department\u201fs future: \n \nYou are absolutely right to say that we work through influencing other departments to a large \nextent. We have a big challenge to think through how we deal with external stakeholders and \nother Whitehall departments and how we influence and motivate them towards our agenda. \nOne of the signs of success of the Department would be to get other departments to think not \njust about their own particular policy priorities but to think about how they are delivered in \nlocal places. If we manage to do that, I think that will be a sign of success. (Kelly 2006) \n \nFilling the gap? The Inspectorates \n \nThe rise of the inspectorates, as noted earlier, has been a notable development associated with the \nspread of new governance arrangements. Their key roles are enforcement, regulation, and feedback \nand advice provision for the centre. Particularly in the latter role, they fill the gap left by the \nmarginalisation of the no longer trusted professions. The Audit Commission has acquired a  \nparticularly key role in implementing the government\u201fs public services modernisation agenda. It acts \n\u201eon the government\u201fs behalf to regulate elected local authorities\u201f and advances a particular view of \nwhat is good practice largely reflecting central government\u201fs priorities (Kelly, 2007: 603). Its role \nhas extended beyond that of simple \u201eauditing\u201f to play an enforcement role in ensuring that local \nauthorities modernise in line with central government policy. Arguably, too, this encompasses a \npolitical role in disciplining dissident authorities less enthusiastic than the government over the \nmodernisation agenda. Notably, the Comprehensive Performance Assessment, the latest in the \nvarious performance management regimes imposed on local government, worked because the CPA \nhas acquired the crucial support of local allies, mainly chief executives and other senior officers \nrather than among the elected members, essentially because the formers\u201f career prospects and even \nsurvival have come to hinge on the CPA results. CPA has also worked because it was backed by the \nAudit Commission which acted as an enforcement system capable of detailed monitoring and able to \npenalise errant authorities with its powers of \u201enaming-and-shaming\u201f. Thus, it could be argued \u201ethat \nthe capacity of the centre to implement policies require, as necessary and sufficient conditions, the \nsupport of local allies plus an enforcement mechanism\u201f (Laffin 2008: 116)  \n \nSuch inspectorates also have important feedback or learning functions for central policymakers. \nThus policy makers can reduce their dependence on, for them, less reliable sources of ideas and \ninformation by looking to the inspectorates. For instance, the reform of Ofsted (now the Office for \nStandards in Education, Children's Services and Skills) has led to it becoming a major source of \ninformation to steer the educational system (Lee and Fitz 1997). Thus inspectorates have acquired, in \npart, the professions\u201f role in promoting policy change and defining, identifying and diffusing \u201egood \npractice\u201f, now the professions are limited to mostly just narrowly technical issues (Laffin and \nEntwistle 2000). Similarly, Brooks (2000) argues that New Labour has mobilised a broad policy \ncommunity, through the Audit Commission, in favour of democratic renewal, involving leading \nlocal authorities, academics and researchers, consultants and bodies such as the Improvement and \nDevelopment Agency (IdeA) (sponsored by the LGA and, therefore, related to local government but \noften identified by local authorities with the central government modernisation agenda). Again, apart \nfrom Kelly\u201fs (2007) work on the Audit Commission, considerable scope exists for research on the \nrole of inspectorates as policy actors. \n \nFilling the Gap: Regional Government Offices  \n 8 \n \nThe government has strengthened the regional level of government within England in particular, the \nrole of regional government offices (GOs), although it has abandoned the idea of elected regional \nassemblies following the rejection of such an assembly in the North-East Referendum. Originally \nestablished in 1994, they were largely seen as enabling Whitehall departments to more effectively \ncontrol regional developments (Bache 2000) and to improve coordination across departments at that \nlevel (Pearce et al. 2008: 446). In 2006 the Government announced its intention \u201eto move the GOs \nfrom being mainly administrative, programme-focused organisations to strategic and \ntransformational offices that add real value in supporting the delivery of key local and regional \noutcomes\u201f (para. 4.8) but with a reduction of a third in staff (HM Treasury 2006). This expansion in \ntheir role could mean that they will overlap and perhaps compete with established central-local \nservice delivery linkages (Pearce et al., 2008: 458). The new expectation that GOs should be \n\u201estrategic\u201f and \u201etransformational\u201f also seems to contrast sharply with their capacity and limited size. \nThus local government chief officers and leading local councillors can find themselves dealing with \nlower middle level officials, whom they often perceive as having a less certain grasp of \u201ehow things \nwork\u201f than themselves. This anecdotal evidence suggests that GOs have some way to go if they are \nto fulfil the role identified by Treasury. That role would also suggest that GOs would need greater \ndiscretion than they presently enjoy if they are to play a more active role. Yet the more discretion \nthey enjoy, the less legitimacy they will have in the absence of any oversight from a regionally-\nelected level of government. Again there is a possible research agenda here to track how far GOs fill \nthe apparent gap in regional-level connections within central-local relations and whether they are \nindeed acquiring an enhanced, \u201etransformational\u201f role. \n \nThe Proliferation of Non-Governmental and Non-Local-Government Linkages \n \nOne consequence of increased governance arrangements has been the emergence of new central-\nlocal linkages, involving non-governmental and non-local-government actors, outside the traditional \ncentral-local government channels. \u201eNon-local government\u201f actors refer here to governmental \nbodies, like those within the health service and law-and-order system, to quangos or non-\ndepartmental governmental bodies (like the Housing Corporation, soon to be Communities \nEngland), voluntary organisations and private sector organisations. All of these actors are located \nwithin distinct central-local linkages, separate from the central-local government relationship \nalthough sometimes overlapping with that relationship. Housing policy provides a good example. In \nhousing a distinct central-local linkage has emerged between the Housing Corporation and housing \nassociations. The Housing Corporation regulates housing associations (although this role is about to \nbe placed with a separate Tenant Services Authority), which are the major providers of low-cost \nsocial housing following the reduced role of authorities as direct providers of housing (a process \ndating back to the earlier period of austerity). Thus the Housing Corporation-housing association \nlinkage has come to be of vital significance for local policy outcomes. However, the Housing \nCorporation operates in a \u201enational\u201f not a \u201elocal\u201f policy context. That means that, in particular, it has \nfaced pressures from Treasury to pursue a policy of promoting amalgamations among housing \nassociations largely on the basis that larger associations are assumed to be more efficient (Murie \n2004: 142). Creating large housing associations, which may have a regional or even a national \npresence, is unlikely to be \u201ea recipe for greater community responsiveness or local control (Murie \n2004: 148) and would also seem to be powerful actors vis-\u00e0-vis individual local authorities (which, \nof course, may be the government\u201fs intention). Again we need to know more about how national \npolicies shape housing associations and, in turn, how they influence local policy and how the \nnational bodies in this area, such as the Housing Corporation (soon to become Communities \nEngland) and National Federation of Housing Associations, influence national policy and thereby \npolicies locally. And, not least, compete with local government representative organisations for \n 9 \ninfluence at the centre. A possible initial hypothesis could be that these alternative policy linkages \ntend to centralise local policy and to weaken local participation. \n \nLabour ministers have continued to reinforce the role of voluntary organisations as alternative ways \nof delivering public services. Under Labour their turnover has increased from around \u00a316 billion to \nover \u00a327 billion between 1997-98 and 2004-05, while their workforce has increased by around a \nfifth (H.M. Treasury 2007: 10). Notably that growth has taken place predominantly in large charities \nwhile the income of many small and medium-sized charities has declined (NCVO 2007 quoted in H. \nM. Treasury 2007: 10). This increase largely reflects increased government funding, both at the local \nand central government levels. Government policy makers have turned to the voluntary sector from a \nmix of ideological, idealistic and instrumental\/cost-saving reasons (Kendal and Knapp 1996: 133-\n164). The Conservatives largely resorted to the voluntary sector to reduce costs (Kendal & Knapp \n1996: 216), but Labour has, at least explicitly, sought a \u201epartnership\u201f with the voluntary sector and \nearly on signed a Compact with the sector. An Office of the Third Sector has been created in the \nCabinet Office (with a spend of \u00a3515m to improve the capacity of that sector). However, Lewis \n(2005: 22) notes (impressionistically) that \u201ein the 2000s, and particularly since 2002, there has been \nmore evidence of large and umbrella voluntary organisations (such as the National Council for \nVoluntary Organisations (NCVO)) playing an active role in shaping the implementation of major \ngovernment initiatives\u201f. Although she believes that central government remains dominant in shaping \nthe overall agenda relating to the voluntary sector. Indeed many of those within charities express \nconcerns over the dangers of being coopted by central or local government: their original and \ncherished mission, particularly where it involves advocacy on behalf of deprived groups, becoming \nlost once they become dependent on government (Osborne and McLaughlin 2004: 579; Charity \nCommission Conference 2006). Clearly there is a need for more studies of the mega-charities and of \nthe voluntary sector umbrella organisations within the context of central-local relations and, as \nLewis suggests, as potentially influential actors within national policy processes.  \n \nPrivate sector organisations have also grown in significance as alternative means of service delivery \nand as sources of advice for government. One group are management consultants which have been \nincreasingly used by Labour in government. The use of consultants by ministers spiralled under the \nThatcher government in the 1980s (Marsh et al., 2001: 178-179).  Labour, too, has used not only \nconsultants on a large scale but also a myriad of policy task forces and advisory groups which may \nbe becoming new, if transient, power centres (Hay and Richards 2000; Barker et al., 1999). A \n\u201erevolving door\u201f phenomenon has also emerged as ministers, special advisers and senior civil \nservants have passed across between consulting companies, and other private sector organisations, \nand the public sector. The extent of this phenomenon remains anecdotal and systematic research \nremains to be done. Another possibly influential type of commercial organisation are service \ncompanies, like SERCO and CAPITA, which have come to play an enhance role in service delivery, \ninitially in the more routine functions but increasingly in managing more complex tasks, such as \ntaking over the running of school education in some places, which arguably means exercising a \ndiscretion in service management once considered a monopoly of directly employed local \ngovernment officers. Thus their role does raise issues of accountability and legitimacy. Yet very \nlittle is known about their policy impact, either at the national or local level. Similarly, Public \nFinance Initiative (PFI) projects and other public-private partnerships mean that financial institutions \nand construction companies, like Jarvis, are also playing a role. Yet again we know little about how \nthey influence policy despite the significant literature examining the financial case for and against \nPFI. Under-researched questions arise over the local and national level consequences of the \nincreased involvement of private sector firms in the provision of services - do they constitute a \u201enew\u201f \nproducerist interest? especially where those involved act strategically in seeking influence at \nwhichever level of government promises them the most opportunity. Certainly, in the past such \n 10 \nrelationships have been significant. Most notably Dunleavy (1981: 129-133) shows how pressure \nfrom construction companies during the 1970s was a major factor in local authorities adopting \nindustrialised high-rise housing contracts, a form of housing now widely seen as contributing to \nserious social problems. Yet no comparable research has been conducted in recent years despite the \ngreatly increased involvement of the private sector in service delivery.  \n \nThe Rise of Party-Centric Networks \n \nThe growth of think tanks has been a notable change in the policy landscape over the last 30 years \n(Stone 1996, Denham and Stone 2004). They, like the inspectorates, could be seen as filling in the \ngap left by the marginalisation of the professions as a key source of policy ideas \u2013 although the \nextent of their influence remains contentious. Under Labour think tanks \u2013 such as the Institute of \nPublic Policy Research (IPPR), Demos and the New Local Government Network (NLGN) \u2013 have \nbeen credited with significant influence. For instance Travers (2007) credits the New Local \nGovernment Network (NLGN) as having had a key influence on government thinking on issues like \nlocal 'Partnership Contracts' which appear to prefigure introduction of the Comprehensive Area \nAssessment. Certainly, anecdotally the NLGN appears to have had more influence in the earlier \nyears of the present Labour government when relations between the NLGN and ministers then in the \nrelevant departments were close. Key figures in left-ward leaning think tanks have been recruited \ninto key roles especially within the Cabinet Office \u2013 most notably Matthew Taylor, formerly \nDirector of the Institute for Public Policy Research, and Geoff Mulgan, formerly Director of Demos. \nHowever Denham and Garnett (2004) argue that under Labour policy makers at the centre have \neffectively re-asserted their control, curtailing think tank influence through the absorption of \n\u201eoutsiders\u201f like Taylor and Mulgan, establishing internal government think tanks (such as the \nCabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit and Social Exclusion Unit) and using external \nthink tanks for certain types of arms\u201f length work which can later be repudiated if it proves \npolitically awkward (Denham & Garnett, 2002: 245).  \n \nIt is notoriously difficult to assess the influence of particular individuals and organisations within the \npolicy process as recent international studies of think tanks recognise, especially given the \nincreasingly crowded policy systems across the world (Abelson 2002). Ministers have continued to \nengage with think tanks (giving speeches, \u201eauthoring\u201f reports and publicly responding to think tank \nreports) and think tanks continue to grow and private sector companies to donate to them. Denham \nand Garnett overlook how many ministers see think tanks as alternative sources of advice to what \nmight otherwise be a civil service monopoly. It is also important to acknowledge that the \nrelationships between government ministers and the think tanks are largely intra-party, so that party \nsolidarity is an important element, although they have been critical of government. Given this \npolitical context, they may be primarily significant as platforms for ideas, arenas for policy debate \noutside official and public arenas, locations for \u201eresting\u201f politicians and as links into government for \n\u201epolicy entrepreneurs\u201f. Their greatest resource is access and potential influence. Thus it may that \ntheir significance is as \u201epolicy impresarios\u201f, bringing together or mediating between policy \nentrepreneurs and their audience of policy-makers. Think tanks, too, are vulnerable to having their \nresearch priorities influenced by commercial interests which may use their sponsorship to support \nparticular types of study. Again limited systematic research has been completed on how think tanks \nwork in general and very little in the specific context of central-local relations.  \n \nConclusion \n \nThis article has sought to stress (1) the vital importance of a central-local relations perspective if \nlocal policy processes and outcomes are to be fully understood and (2) the changed nature of those \n 11 \nrelations in an era of governance. Firstly, central-local relations must be understood within the post-\nwar historical context of the party politics of the welfare state and not as a simple story of central \nencroachment on local autonomy. Successive periods in the development of the welfare state have \nhad different implications for local government and the ways in which central government has \nsought to control local authorities. Meanwhile, the demise of central government has been much \nexaggerated. It remains the dominant force within central-local relations, although the means of that \ndomination have changed over time and inevitably those means appear more oppressive in periods of \nausterity and renewal than in periods of expansion. Secondly, the changing politics of the welfare \nstate has not just driven the shift towards the greater central reliance on governance arrangements \nbut also the parallel shift away from a once highly institutionalised national local government \nsystem, dominated by service-based policy communities, towards more fluid national-level policy \nprocesses involving more diverse types of actors and in which service-based boundaries have \ndeclined in significance. Nevertheless, the key question remains whether these changes involve the \ndisplacement of one type of policy community for another, the party-centric replacing the \nprofession-centric, or whether they represent a move towards greater pluralism with an opening up \nof access to non-conventional policy actors.   \n \nReferences \n \nAbelson, D (2002) Do Think Tanks Matter?
