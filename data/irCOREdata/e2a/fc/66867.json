What is the cost of living in the Papua New Guinea highlands? An\nanswer is sought using a time and energy accounting approach. The\nsubsistence regime of Wola-speaking highlanders, the subjects of this inves-\ntigation, comprises three components. The principal one is horticulture:\npeople clearing gardens from forest and grassland, with tuberous crops\npredominating, notably sweet potato. The second component comprises\nanimal rearing, notably of domestic pigs. The third, and least important, is\nhunting and gathering for food in the forest. The calculated returns on\ninvestments in these subsistence domains vary considerably. Gardens return\nin their crops between ten and fifteen times the energy expended in\ncultivation. Pigs may also give a good return, of four to five times the energy\ninvested in rearing them, if slaughtered when adult, but people regularly keep\nanimals for years and may incur negative energy returns on their labour\ninvestments. This relates to the high cultural premium put on pigs. Foraging\nfor food is also energetically costly, the Wola expending four times more\nenergy on these activities than they gain in return from the food they secure.\nThis analysis of energy gains and losses challenges the relative notion of\naffluence as applied to foragers, by reviewing it in the comparative context\nof subsistence horticulture.\nIntroduction\nA review of data on hunter\u2013gatherer subsistence activities discussed in the 1960s at\na conference entitled \u2018Man the Hunter\u2019 prompted apparently outrageous claims of\naffluence. An on-going debate has ensued into the costs and benefits of hunter\u2013\ngatherer life (Lee & Devore, 1968; Sahlins, 1972; Altman, 1984; Bird-David, 1992;\nKaplan, 2000; Rowley-Conwy, 2001). The argument is that the hunter\u2013gatherer way\nof life is not the hard travail once thought. According to Lee (1968) the !Kung\nBushmen can supply their subsistence needs working one day in every four or five. An\nArnhem Land Aborigine (Altman, 1984) spends 2\u00b79 h a day hunting with an average\n433\nreturn of 4773 kcal, suggesting that today (using firearms) he can supply his daily\nenergy requirements in about 1\u00b75 h. Data from a range of foraging societies (South\nAmerican, African, South-east Asian and Australian; Kelly 1995; Tables 3\u20137) support\nthese statistics with overall average daily hunting returns being enough to supply a\nhunter for 9 days. The affluence argument implies a reversal of Victorian-derived\nevolutionary assumptions, suggesting that life becomes less affluent as we move from\nhunting and gathering to a farming existence. This paper supplies comparative data\nwith which to assess this proposition. It aims to assess the costs of living under a\npredominantly farming subsistence regime in the highlands of Papua New Guinea,\nwhere people engage infrequently in hunting and gathering.\nThe Wola of highland New Guinea traditionally subsist by cultivating gardens,\nkeeping pigs and occasionally hunting and gathering wild resources, and the majority\nof the population continue to do so. Data on these subsistence activities, documenting\ninputs and outputs, have been collected over several years. They invite an investigation\nof rate of return for effort. One currency for assessing the cost of living under such a\nsubsistence regime is energy. The energetics approach comprises a significant strand in\nthe study of human ecology as it has developed since the 1960s (Lee, 1969; Moran,\n1982; Ellen, 1982, 1996; Dwyer, 1983). It is conceptually straightforward, drawing on\nthe ecosystem concept and seeking to equate energy expended with energy earned (as\nin the equation: energy balance=energy in \u2013 energy out) but methodologically difficult.\nAnother question related to the affluence hypothesis concerns the extent to which\ndifferent subsistence strategies change the balance of work and rewards between\nwomen and men. Some writers prefer to reverse the customary hunter\u2013gatherer label to\ngatherer\u2013hunter to underline the importance of women\u2019s plant and small game\nforaging contribution to this livelihood regime (Meehan, 1974). Others question the\nassumption that women are responsible for a disproportionate share of the work. The\nArnhem Land data (Altman, 1984) demonstrate that today men contribute overwhelm-\ningly more bush food to the diet than women and they suggest that previously both\nmay have contributed equally. In addition, data from several foraging societies (Kelly,\n1995, p. 21) indicate that men engage 4\u00b73 h a day to women\u2019s 3\u00b73 h in food-getting\nactivities (such a generalization is of academic interest only given the wide variety of\nsubsistence regimes characterizing foraging societies). The highlanders of New Guinea\nare well known for their discrimination of men\u2019s activities from women\u2019s, distinctions\nunderscored by men\u2019s fears of women\u2019s abilities to harm them (Strathern, 1972;\nSillitoe, 1979a; Josephides, 1985; Lederman, 1986). The data analysed here quantify\ndifferences between women\u2019s and men\u2019s contributions to subsistence activities. The\ndifference is considerable, although interpreting its significance is subject to dispute.\nIndeed, interpreting the entire subsistence regime is problematic, as in energetic terms\nit seems in some respects wasteful, if not profligate. Whether this is evidence of\naffluence is debatable but it does underline the importance of seeing subsistence\nactivities in wider cultural context and not merely biologically in adaptive terms.\nThe Wola\nThe Wola speakers occupy five valleys in the Southern Highlands of Papua New\nGuinea, between 6 \u0002 0\u0003\/15\u0003 latitude south and 143 \u0002 15\u0003\/45\u0003 longitude east. They live at\n434 P. Sillitoe\n1600\u20132000 m above sea level, between the Ak river in the west and the Mendi in the\neast. The data discussed here come from the Nipa Basin Census Division, notably the\nWas valley in the west. A recently folded mountainous region, it supports lower\nmontane rainforest (CSIRO, 1965). People live along the valley sides, leaving the\nintervening forested watersheds largely unoccupied. In the valleys, where they have\ncultivated extensively, there are areas of dense cane grassland. Cash crops are few.\nThe region\u2019s climate is of the \u2018Lower Montane Humid\u2019 type (according to McAlpine\net al.\u2019s scheme (1983), p. 160), characterized by high rainfall and cool temperatures.\nA prominent feature of Wola social life is the exchange of wealth between defined\ncategories of kin on specified social occasions, such as at a marriage or following a\ndeath, sometimes bringing together large numbers of people (Sillitoe, 1979b). These\ntransactions remain today a significant force for order in their fiercely egalitarian\nacephalous society with weak central government authority. Lawless \u2018rascal\u2019 activity\nis prevalent throughout the region. Men who excel at exchange achieve locally\npositions of renown and influence, earning the appellative ol howma, approximating\nto \u2018bigmen\u2019 elsewhere. But \u2018bigmanship\u2019 does not extend to authority to direct the\nactions of others. People live in homesteads comprising nuclear or extended families,\nindistinctly grouped together on territories, resulting in loosely constituted patrifilially\nbiased bilateral kin corporations. Wolaland is divided up into a large number of\nterritories to which these kin-composed groups, called sem \u2018families\u2019, claim rights\ncollectively, structuring access to land (Sillitoe, 1999a). Supernatural beliefs are\ncentred on ancestors\u2019 spirits causing sickness and death by \u2018eating\u2019 vital organs,\nothers\u2019 powers of sorcery and \u2018poison\u2019, and malevolent forest spirits. Today many\npeople profess to be Christians and attend mission services.\nThe region is described as peripheral in development terms, although the\nHighlands Highway runs through Wola territory. But with gas and oil finds the\nposition may change, with exploitation of these in the near future. The government\nstation at Nipa in the Nembi valley has some administrative offices, including\nnominally a police station, a high school and health centre, and several trade stores.\nWhile the population continues to depend on local food production to meet most of\nits needs, it has some access to imported processed foodstuffs, which can have a\nsignificant impact on nutritional status, as demonstrated for the neighbouring Huli\nwho have access to Tari town (Umezaki, Yamauchi & Ohtsuka, 1999; Kuchikura,\n1999).\nThe livelihood regime\nHorticulture\nThe Wola are skilful horticulturalists. Sweet potato is the staple, typically\ncultivated in composted mounds. Other crops include bananas, taro, various cucurbits\nand greens. The farming regime spans a range of management practices from classic\nshifting cultivation (sites cultivated once before abandonment to natural fallow for\nmany years) through to semi-permanent farming (fertility managed through compost-\ning and the occasional brief fallow under grass) (Bourke et al., 1995, p. 61; Sillitoe,\n1996). About one-third of land currently under gardens is cultivated for the first time\nCost of living in the Papua New Guinea highlands 435\nand the remainder are recultivations. These agricultural practices result in two broad\nclasses of garden: those cleared and planted once with a wide variety of crops, and\nthose cultivated repeatedly, sometimes over decades, with brief fallows, which support\na narrower range of crops, largely sweet potato. The cultivation of a new garden\nproceeds in a series of stages, according to which the forthcoming analysis of work\nis structured (after Conklin, 1961): clear natural vegetation; enclose area with fences\nand ditches where necessary; pull up roots and pollard trees; burn dead and dry\nvegetation; till soil and plant crops. Up to the burning-off stage men do the work,\nwomen joining them to incinerate small refuse and plant the garden with crops,\nsubsequently tending and harvesting the majority. The stages are fewer when\nrecultivating an established garden: up-root weedy regrowth and any remaining\ncrops; sun-dry pulled-up vegetation and use as compost; till soil, heap into mounds,\nand plant.\nPigs\nBoth humans and pigs depend on garden produce, pigs being fed largely sweet\npotato. The animals are also transacted in socio-political exchanges. The work\ninvolved in herding pigs appears considerable at first. It follows the common\nhighlands pattern (Pospisil, 1963; Feacham, 1973; Rappaport, 1968; Hide, 1981;\nBoyd, 1984). Women are largely responsible for the animals. The daily routine is to\nrelease them in the early morning to forage for the day in neighbouring fallow\ngrassland and forest. Troublesome pigs, however, may be kept penned up or tethered\non a rope. (This free-ranging arrangement differs from that found in some densely\npopulated highland regions such as Chimbu, where people more often tether or pen\nanimals during the day (Hide, 1981, p. 328), or some Enga who use river flats\nenclosed by steep banks (Feacham, 1973, p. 27).) Sometimes people put animals in\nharvested gardens to feed on any remaining tubers and other crops. The Wola say\nthat pigs forage for earthworms mainly, producing layers of fat. In the late afternoon\npigs are conditioned to return to the homestead. When they arrive they are fed a\ntuber ration. They spend the night in stalls, traditionally built at the rear of women\u2019s\nhouses, although today many are housed in adjacent lean-to shelters in response to\nadmonitions from mission and government health workers that living with pigs is\ndirty and unhealthy. Some women regularly manage more pigs than others and are\nadmired for their ability, earning the appellative of ten howma as a mark of their\nwidely respected competence; as with men this title carries no authority.\nHunting\nThe forest supports a varied animal population of marsupials, rodents and birds\n(Menzies, 1991; Flannery, 1990). In cane regrowth it is relatively meagre, comprising\nsmall rodents and birds. The Wola identify by name several hundred animals. These\ninclude mammals such as cuscuses, ringtails, bandicoots, echidnas and possums, and\nbirds, some of them distinctive, such as the flightless cassowary and colourful birds\nof paradise. Other game includes frogs and fish and the occasional large reptile,\nnotably pythons. The most prized are large marsupials, rodents and birds, all pursued\n436 P. Sillitoe\nby men, with small mammals, frogs and insects being less significant and more often\ncollected by women and children. The Wola employ six of the seven hunting strategies\nBulmer (1968, pp. 308\u2013313) identifies for New Guinea: stalking, ambushing, luring,\nbesetting, chasing and trapping animals. Persons can only hunt legitimately on sem\n\u2018family\u2019 territories where they reside or where residents recognize them as rightful kin.\nThey may be accused of poaching if they hunt elsewhere. One of a hunter\u2019s most\nvaluable assets is his intimate knowledge of his home territory. He will roam widely\nacross it when hunting, visiting both distant forest and nearby secondary regrowth,\nthe latter supporting fruiting vegetation attractive to game.\nMethods\nWhile conceptually straightforward, energy accounting is fraught with methodological\nproblems, particularly in Papua New Guinea for which there are limited data.\nAlthough the methods used have advanced considerably since the approach was\npioneered, collecting accurate data to match the simple elegance of energy-flow\nmodels remains a problem (Pelto, Pelto & Messer, 1989; Ulijaszek 1992, 1995). Its\nchequered course is due in part to inflated claims relative to available data and\nresearch techniques (for example, in the New Guinea highlands, Rappaport\u2019s 1968\ncybernetic reduction of Maring ritual to an energy management regime: Rappaport,\n1977, 1984; Kelly & Rappaport, 1975; McArthur, 1974, 1977; Friedman, 1974, 1979;\nBergmann, 1975; Wagner, 1977; Hide, 1981, pp. 549\u2013562). The problems that attend\nenergy accounting have recently prompted a move to using ratios such as the \u2018physical\nactivity level\u2019 (PAL), the ratio of energy expenditure to basal metabolic rate, but data\ndifficulties remain (FAO\/WHO\/UNU, 1985; James, 1988; James & Schofield, 1990).\nThis paper, depending on secondary sources for physiological data, uses the\naccounting approach. Some criticize the idea that energy can be used as a common\ncurrency to evaluate subsistence activities (Smith, 1979; Foley, 1985, pp. 228\u2013229;\nKelly, 1995, pp. 101\u2013108), and we could legitimately use other dietary measures such\nas protein returns. The energy approach singles out calorific outlays and returns from\nother nutritional data for comparative purposes because they are human physiological\nuniversals readily amenable to quantification (Ulijaszek, 1995). The analysis of energy\nflows is not intended to suggest that highlanders frame their activities in this way, and\ncertainly not that we can \u2018assign any absolute values to what one might call a\n\u2018\u2018coefficient of disinclination\u2019\u2019 \u2019, (Healey, 1990a, b, p. 95).\nThe energy output side of the equation quantifies the work expended in various\nproductive activities. This can be close observation of particular tasks, as in this\nstudy\u2019s time-and-motion analysis of swidden cultivation, or wider surveys of people\u2019s\ndaily activities, which may feature direct observation or random spot checks, as for\nthe pig-herding data, or depend on recall questionnaires or the keeping of diaries, as\nin the hunting survey reported here (Nydon & Thomas, 1989; Ulijaszek, 1992). The\nenergy expended can be measured in several ways, either in the field or under\nstandardized conditions, using for example indirect calorimetry (measuring rates of\noxygen consumption), heart rate monitoring (correlating heart beats with different\nactivities), and doubly-labelled water (using stable isotopes to trace gross daily energy\nexpenditure). The direct measurement of energy expenditure while individuals are\nCost of living in the Papua New Guinea highlands 437\nactually engaged in various daily tasks, which is the surest method, is intrusive and\nlikely to interfere with normal activity patterns and distort the results: they effectively\nperform for the researchers. The extent of the sample problem may remain unknown,\nindividuals varying considerably in their energy expenditures, making the extrapol-\nation of results up to the population level problematic, without several time-\nconsuming replicate studies of, for example, swidden cultivation by different\nhouseholds. Such time-consuming direct physiological measurements are expensive\nand many studies, such as this one, resort to indirect methods and refer to\ncomparable published data on energy expenditure. While every effort is made to use\ndata from populations as near as possible biologically and culturally to the one\nstudied, there is unavoidably a degree of probable error. The data used here come\nfrom the Lufa population of the Eastern Highlands, the energy they expended on\ndifferent tasks being measured by indirect calorimetry using a Max\u2013Planck respirom-\neter (Norgan, Ferro-Luzzi & Durnin, 1974). (Energetics data reported for the Huli,\nwestern neighbours of the Wola in the Southern Highlands, are of the same order as\nthe Lufa data. These data are calculated estimates of energy expenditure based on\nheart rate monitoring, not direct calorimetric measurements, and they are presented\nas aggregate means for categories of work such as gardening or pig keeping, not\naccording to specific activities, such as clearing or fencing tasks (Yamauchi, Umezaki\n& Ohtsuka, 2000, n.d.).) The energy expended by the Wola on various subsistence\ntasks is estimated by the factorial method, multiplying the time people spent on\nvarious work by the energy cost per minute.\nThe energy input side of the equation quantifies the food obtained and consumed\nfrom various productive activities. These food inputs are converted to energy and\nnutritional values either directly by sampling food and undertaking chemical analysis,\nsuch as bomb calorimetry, or indirectly, as in this study, by reference to published\ndata on food composition (Ulijaszek & Strickland, 1993). While every effort is again\nmade to use food values reported from the Papua New Guinea highlands region (e.g.\nBradbury & Holloway, 1988; Hipsley & Kirk, 1965; Wills et al., 1983; Norgan,\nDurnin & Ferro-Luzzi, 1979; Hongo & Ohtsuka, 1993), there is an unknown level of\nprobable error regarding the western Wola region. Even where projects can meet the\nconsiderable expense of the necessary laboratory work, sizeable margins of error\nremain, and specimens of the same food from a region can vary widely in\ncomposition. Method of preparation can also have a notable impact on energy\ncontent, as work on sweet potato shows: tuber energy values in Norgan et al. (1979),\nfor example, range from 380 to 669 kJ (100 g)\u00041 (see also Hongo & Ohtsuka, 1993).\nIf the higher of these values were used in the calculations made here, it would increase\nby 50% the energy intake. Again, diet surveys are intrusive and may upset people\u2019s\nnormal consumption patterns, and the extent of the sample problem may remain\nunknown, individuals varying considerably in their food intake.\nHorticulture\nThe horticultural data come from close observation of the establishment of a new\nswidden at a location called Ganonkiyba in the Was valley. The area cleared was\n2335 m2, comprising both forest and cane grass, the two principal vegetation\n438 P. Sillitoe\ncommunities (just over one-third of the site (892 m2) was under Miscanthus cane). The\nforest was of the disturbed variety (although never cleared for a garden in living\nmemory, it was near a settlement and people had collected firewood and raw\nmaterials there over many years). The area finally enclosed was 1577 m2. Five men,\nrelated members of the same sem community, cleared and enclosed the site, assisted\nsubsequently in burning and planting by female relatives. The men\u2019s ages differed, in\nan attempt to approximate some average male physical working capacity. The area to\nbe cleared was demarcated by cutting a swathe about 2 m wide around its perimeter.\nOtherwise people worked with no direction or supervision, doing the job as they\nthought best, resting when they chose. The recultivation data were collected in the\nsame manner, observing the pulling up of vegetation from 117 m2, the tilling of soil\non 164 m2, and heaping up of sweet potato mounds on 108 m2. Atypically people\nworked under constant observation, with the timing of all tasks and other\nmeasurements as applicable. A large clock with a second hand was used for the\ntiming, and an attempt was made to note the times of activities to the nearest five\nseconds. This method was less accurate than using a stop-watch, but that would have\nnecessitated stop\u2013go interference in the work (which was scrupulously avoided), or,\nimpractically, several assistants armed with stop-watches. The probable error in the\ntimings was plus or minus five seconds (see Clarke, 1971, p. 173, for comparative\ndata). The method did not constrain people to single activities. The gardeners\nfrequently hopped from one task to another in a free flow. While this allowed the\nnatural rhythm of work to proceed, it placed a strain on the investigator who, having\nno control over the proceedings, had to make, and abide by, snap decisions.\nAll crops harvested from the new swidden were weighed using a spring balance\n(Table 7); those co-operating in the study brought all crops for weighing before any\nculinary preparation. These data were supplemented with measurements of house-\nholds\u2019 daily food intake, which involved weighing of food brought back from other\ngardens (for further data and discussion of food consumed, see Sillitoe, 1983,\npp. 217\u2013246). The yields of sweet potato tubers from a sample of long-established\ngardens were also measured, using the clear harvesting technique (for details see\nSillitoe, 1996, p. 44).\nPigs\nThe pig-herding data come from a survey of people\u2019s daily time budgets. The\ninformation was collected over 72 days during which thirteen women and twelve men\nreported daily on their activities over the previous twenty-four hours. The times were\nestimates. A range of estimating methods were used, including the sun\u2019s position\nin the sky, the start or end of rainfalls or other events known in common to\nthe participants. Also, those involved in the survey were instructed to shout out to\nthe author if they passed his house or if they saw him elsewhere during the day. The\ninvestigator could sometimes triangulate between these precisely timed events, and the\nperson subsequently meeting others participating in the survey. On a few occasions\nthe author accompanied the participants during the day and was able to time their\nactivities, these data serving to check the plausibility of the estimated times. During\nthe survey period the thirteen women in the sample herded 26 large pigs for\nCost of living in the Papua New Guinea highlands 439\nT\nab\nle\n1.\nF\noo\nd\nva\nlu\nes\nfo\nr\npo\nrk\n,\nga\nm\ne\nan\nd\ned\nib\nle\nw\nild\npl\nan\nts\nF\noo\nd\nSo\nur\nce\na\nE\ndi\nbl\ne\npo\nrt\nio\nnb\nE\nne\nrg\ny\n(k\nJ\n(1\n00\ng)\n\u0004\n1\n)\nP\nro\nte\nin\n(g\n(1\n00\ng)\n\u0004\n1\n)\nF\nat\n(g\n(1\n00\ng)\n\u0004\n1\n)\nW\nat\ner\n(%\n)\nC\nc\nU\nC\nc\nC\nU\nC\nC\nU\nC\nC\nU\nC\nP\nig\ns P\nor\nk\nm\nea\nt\n1\n69\n4\n30\n\u00b71\n4\u00b7\n1\n64\n\u00b71\n1\n67\n3\n19\n\u00b75\n6\u00b7\n5\n68\n\u00b75\n1\n71\n9\n27\n\u00b70\n5\u00b7\n4\n64\n\u00b75\n2\n37\n6\u00b7\n6\n20\n\u00b75\n0\u00b7\n7\n77\n\u00b70\n2\n38\n4\u00b7\n9\n19\n\u00b76\n0\u00b7\n7\n76\n\u00b75\nP\nig\n\u2019s\nliv\ner\n2\n57\n7\u00b7\n4\n22\n\u00b70\n3\u00b7\n8\n68\n\u00b75\nA\nve\nra\nge\nva\nlu\ned\n57\n0\u00b7\n8\n23\n\u00b71\n3\u00b7\n5\n69\n\u00b79\nP\nor\nk\nfa\nt\n1\n27\n00\n4\u00b7\n0\n68\n\u00b73\n26\n\u00b75\n3\n18\n82\n10\n\u00b70\n45\n\u00b70\nA\nve\nra\nge\nva\nlu\ned\n22\n91\n7\u00b7\n0\n56\n\u00b77\n26\n\u00b75\nG\nam\ne\nC\nus\ncu\ns\nP\nha\nla\nng\ner\nsp\n.\n1\n0\u00b7\n60\ne\n84\n4\u00b7\n0\n65\n6\u00b7\n0\n21\n\u00b77\n16\n\u00b78\n11\n\u00b73\n8\u00b7\n8\n64\n\u00b71\n73\n\u00b70\nF\nly\nin\ng\nfo\nx\nD\nob\nso\nni\na\n1\n0\u00b7\n85\n84\n0\u00b7\n0\n60\n6\u00b7\n0\n20\n\u00b75\n14\n\u00b78\n9\u00b7\n3\n6\u00b7\n7\n61\n\u00b75\n73\n\u00b70\nB\nan\ndi\nco\not\nE\nch\nym\nip\ner\na\nsp\n.\n2\n0\u00b7\n80\n40\n1\u00b7\n7\n30\n1\u00b7\n3\n21\n\u00b74\n16\n\u00b71\n1\u00b7\n1\n0\u00b7\n8\n76\n\u00b70\nB\nir\nds\nf\nSe\ne\nno\nte\n2\n0\u00b7\n85\n45\n0\u00b7\n5\n33\n7\u00b7\n9\n19\n\u00b74\n14\n\u00b76\n2\u00b7\n2\n1\u00b7\n7\n74\n\u00b76\nL\nar\nva\ne\nC\ner\nam\nby\nci\nda\ne\n2\n1\u00b7\n00\n11\n12\n\u00b79\n83\n4\u00b7\n7\n20\n\u00b72\n15\n\u00b72\n19\n\u00b76\n14\n\u00b77\n55\n\u00b79\nL\niz\nar\ndg\nV\nar\nan\nus\nsp\n.\n2\n0\u00b7\n95\n42\n2\u00b7\n6\n31\n7\u00b7\n0\n23\n\u00b78\n17\n\u00b79\n0\u00b7\n6\n0\u00b7\n5\n73\n\u00b70\nE\ngg\nG\nal\nlu\ns\nsp\n.\n4\n0\u00b7\n85\n68\n2\u00b7\n0\n12\n\u00b70\n12\n\u00b74\nW\nild\npl\nan\nts\nF\nun\ngi\nA\nga\nri\ncu\ns\nsp\n.\n5\n1\u00b7\n0\n96\n\u00b76\n1\u00b7\n2\n0\u00b7\n3\nP\nan\nda\nn\nnu\nts\nP\nan\nda\nnu\ns\nsp\np.\n6\n0\u00b7\n4\n27\n00\n11\n\u00b79\n66\n\u00b70\nT\nre\ne\nfe\nrn\nfr\non\nds\nA\nls\nop\nhi\nla\nsp\np.\n7\n0\u00b7\n9\n18\n0\u00b7\n6\n5\u00b7\n5\nW\nat\ner\ndr\nop\nw\nor\nt\nO\nen\nan\nth\ne\nja\nva\nni\nca\n8\n1\u00b7\n0\n11\n7\u00b7\n6\n1\u00b7\n8\n0\u00b7\n3\nP\nal\nm\nfr\nui\nts\nA\nre\nca\nm\nac\nro\nca\nly\nx\nC\nhe\nw\ned\nas\nna\nrc\not\nic\nF\noo\ntn\not\nes\nto\nta\nbl\ne\non\nfa\nci\nng\npa\nge\n.\n440 P.

The participants made a total of 329 documented trips.\nThe procedure was that men informed the author as they left to hunt and the time\nwas noted, and they came straight to the author on their return so that it could be\nnoted again. The author accompanied them on a few trips. Sometimes they stayed\novernight in a bush house, especially if they had visited a remote locale, and the time\nthey finished hunting and resumed again the next day had to be estimated. This was\ndone again according to the sun\u2019s position and other natural time markers, such as\nwhen the cicadas started to sing, the early morning cloud lifted from valleys and so\non. The total time spent hunting on these diary trips was 2374 h (excluding estimated\ntimes it was 1252\u00b795 h). Immediately on the hunter\u2019s return, an account of his\nactivities was recorded as a diary entry. If the hunters caught anything, the whole\nanimal was weighed (using a spring balance); these data are used in the calculations\nof energy returns, again using food values from published sources (Table 1).\nResults\nEnergy expenditure\nHorticulture. The data on swidden cultivation suggest that the Wola expend in the\nregion of 4680 MJ ha\u00041 clearing gardens through to harvesting crops (Table 2). The\nmost demanding task overall is harvesting, followed by burning off, which is perhaps\napposite given the importance attached to firing in this farming regime.

After this come various\ncrop-planting tasks.\nThe re-cultivation of gardens is not, as one might first assume, more energy\nefficient overall. At some 4410 MJ ha\u00041 it is similar to clearing and cultivating new\nswiddens (Table 3). The tasks of tilling the soil, heaping up mounds and planting\nsweet potato vines are responsible for nearly one-half of this energy outlay, and\nharvesting again makes a heavy demand. A significant difference is that more of this\nwork falls to women than men, who are responsible for tilling and planting both new\nand reworked plots. While they expend less energy per unit time than men on any\ntask, women contribute 63% (2954\u00b752 MJ ha\u00041) of the total energy invested in\ncultivating a new swidden and 92% (4074\u00b715 MJ ha\u00041) in recultivating an established\ngarden. The gender-adjusted energy implications are considerable. Women contribute\noverall 82% of the energy invested in agricultural production, calculated as a ratio of\ntwo established gardens reworked for every new swidden cleared. This statistic reflects\ndaily observation, where one more often sees women engaged in farming than men.\nPigs. The data indicate that pig herding is not energetically demanding on average.\nHerd size is clearly a consideration, and while this can vary considerably, most\nwomen herd between two and six animals at any time. The survey data indicate that\nwomen spend on average 28 min a day herding pigs or 29 min including cassowaries\n(Table 4). These mean times apply to a herd averaging about five pigs and 0\u00b725\ncassowaries in size. The principal work involves foddering animals, and stalling and\nreleasing them, women spending about 50% of their time on these tasks, which are\nnot onerous. The survey data reveal that men, while acknowledging that female\nrelatives are responsible for pigs, contribute about 20% of the total time invested in\npig herding, working an average of 7 min a day. (The Enga spend even less time\nherding pigs, both women and men devoting only about 6 min daily to it; Waddell\n(1972), p. 101.)

According to these calculations, a woman expends\n388\u00b74 kJ a day and a man 107\u00b76 kJ attending to pigs (Table 5).\nThese calculations omit the energy expended in supplying pigs with food, for\nwhich women are largely responsible. The Wola feed a substantial 49\u00b78% of their\nsweet potato harvest to pigs; the average ration fed to a large animal is 2\u00b779 kg daily\n(Sillitoe, 1983, p. 238).

But\nit is questionable whether this work should be assigned to pig keeping, as if people\nundertake it specifically to feed pigs. They feed small, stringy and soft tubers to pigs,\nTable 4.

They do not clear gardens to feed pigs, rather they feed them rejected\nproduce. (This is even more evident with other foodstuffs, which are direct waste from\nhuman consumption, such as Setaria palmifolia shuckings.) People would undertake\nmore or less the same garden work to feed themselves whether or not they had to\nfodder pigs, and so the time and energy expended in gardening is not strictly speaking\ndirected towards pig production. Others have noted similar arrangements elsewhere\n(e.g. Boyd, 1984, p. 35), and tried to estimate the proportion of small tubers people\nconsider unfit to eat. Among the Chimbu, upwards of 25% of tubers are pig food\n(Brookfield & Brown, 1963, p. 58). Among the Maring, Rappaport (1968, p. 260)\nmaintains that 30\u201350% of the sweet potato harvest comprises sub-standard tubers.\nFor the Sinasina, Hide (1981, p. 377) has tried to estimate the number of pigs that\na garden can support on sub-standard tubers alone and concludes 0\u00b722 \u2018pig units\u2019 for\nevery \u2018reference\u2019 human-being supported on the produce.\nIf the labour put into cultivating gardens is discounted, this leaves that put into\nharvesting and transporting the pigs\u2019 share of tubers. Data on harvesting, from the\ntime survey, suggest that women spend on average 1 h 29 min a day harvesting tubers.\nThe proportion they spend harvesting pig tubers is 42 min (by weight). The average\nenergy expended daily is 474\u00b76 kJ, using Norgan et al.\u2019s (1974, p. 343) figure of\n11\u00b73 kJ min\u00041 digging tubers. Again it is arguable that women would excavate\ninferior tubers anyway, as they search for those suitable for human consumption, and\nso they would use this energy whether or not they had pigs to fodder. Estimating the\nenergy women expend in transporting tubers back to their homesteads is trickier, this\ninvolving journeys of less than 1 min to over 1 h (Sillitoe, 1999b). An informed\nestimation can be made by calculating the distance to the median garden in a sample\n(calculated both according to number of gardens and their areas; the sample includes\n577 gardens with a combined total area of 567,366 m2). Such a median garden will\nfall between 5 and 15 min walk from the homestead. If this is taken to represent\nthe mean distance that women travel to their gardens, it can be assumed that the\naverage one-way journey to a garden is 10 min. According to Norgan et al. (1974,\np. 341), a woman carrying a load expends 23\u00b70 kJ min\u00041 of energy walking uphill and\nTable 5.

It can be assumed that on a round-trip journey she will spend the same\namount of time walking uphill as downhill. On a 20 min return journey a hypothetical\naverage woman, unburdened on her outward journey and heavily laden on her return,\nwill expend a total of 366 kJ of energy.\nAccording to these calculations, and omitting the work put into cultivating\ngardens, women expend on average 1229 kJ a day in herding pigs, including digging\ntheir tuber ration and carrying it back to the homestead. This is an overestimate. If\nthe energy spent digging tubers is halved, on the grounds that the harvest of pig\ntubers is in part a by-product of digging for human food, and discount the energy\nexpended on the outward journey and reduce by seven-eights that expended on the\nreturn (on the grounds again that a woman would expend this energy anyway going\nto harvest food for human consumption and transporting it back home), a total\naverage daily energy expenditure keeping pigs of 829 kJ is arrived at, which is\nprobably a truer reflection of the cost of pig herding to women. This represents\nsomewhere in the region of 8% of a woman\u2019s daily energy expenditure, whereas men\nonly expend about 1% of theirs directly on pig-herding tasks.\nHunting. The calculation of energy expended by hunters is again tricky. Problems\nare encountered with an activity such as hunting, in which effort varies irregularly,\ncompared with a regular one such as digging a trench, where all that has to be\nallowed for are differences in work rates and energy consumption between individuals\n(according to age, physique, etc.). A hunter may go from walking slowly as he stalks\nthrough the forest to running full stretch in pursuit of an animal, or from sitting\nsilently in ambush to climbing a large tree. The problems are compounded by men\nengaging in non-hunting activities during trips, such as collecting firewood, resting,\ncooking food, and so on. The hunting diary data are too gross to distinguish between\ntime expended on different activities, hunting or non-hunting. So too are the available\npublished physiological data on energy outlays.\nAccording to the Lufa data (Norgan et al., 1974), a man hunting birds uses\n15\u00b71 kJ min\u00041 of energy, which falls between that expended walking across level\nterrain slowly, at 13\u00b70 kJ, and walking normally, at 17\u00b76 kJ min\u00041. This energy outlay\nis what the authors anticipate for hunting as \u2018essentially moderate exercise consisting\nmostly of rather slow walking through the bush,\u2019 (Norgan et al., 1974, p. 342). People\nexpend more energy in hilly terrain, using 25\u00b71 kJ min\u00041 (range 20\u00b79\u201333\u00b71 kJ min\u00041)\nwhen walking uphill and 13\u00b78 kJ min\u00041 (range 12\u00b76\u201315\u00b79 kJ min\u00041) when walking\ndownhill. The Wola spend the greater part of their time hunting across mountainous\nterrain: they occupy considerably more precipitous country than the Lufa, which\npossibly adds to their hunting costs. They also engage in some very strenuous activity,\nsuch as felling trees to dislodge animals. The energy expended in felling trees is\npredictably large at 24\u00b73 kJ min\u00041, while that demanded in activities analogous to\nsetting traps is less, at 17\u00b76 kJ min\u00041 to collect vine and 13\u00b78 kJ min\u00041 to lash fence\nstakes. After reviewing this evidence, Dwyer (1983, p. 151) concludes that the energy\nexpended on average by the Etolo while hunting in all activities combined falls\nbetween 16\u00b765 and 19\u00b742 kJ min\u00041. This seems a reasonable assumption and this\nstudy takes the mean of these two values \u2013 18\u00b704 kJ min\u00041 \u2013 to calculate energy\nCost of living in the Papua New Guinea highlands 447\nexpended by Wola hunters. This value is higher than the 13\u00b79 kJ min\u00041 estimate\nmade by Yamauchi et al. (n.d.), who only consider less-strenuous gathering activities\nand not hunting for Huli men. According to these data men expended a total\nof 2569 MJ hunting for 2374 h during the diary survey, about 1 MJ every hour\n(Table 6; the table indicates the proportion of trips involving an overnight stay\nelsewhere, when times were estimated).\nEnergy returns\nHorticulture. The yields from new gardens, according to the Ganonkiyba data\n(Table 7), total 7360 kg ha\u00041 of mixed crops, comprising 5506 kg ha\u00041 tubers\n(overwhelmingly sweet potato, at 5410 kg ha\u00041), 639 kg ha\u00041 green-leafed crops,\n77 kg ha\u00041 cucurbit pepos and 1138 kg ha\u00041 other crops (shoots, pulses, etc.). These\nyields are low and give a false idea of the returns on new swiddens for the labour\ninvested in cultivating them. They are depressed for several reasons. Firstly, the\nGanonkiyba soil proved to be taebowgiy (poor), that is hard and cloddy, the topsoil\nthin across the site, with compact clayey subsoil near the surface, in the rooting zone\nof crops. Secondly, the site suffered from a plague of rats, which attacked some crops,\nnotably those propagated from seed. Thirdly, the garden, located near to homesteads,\nwas \u2018discovered\u2019 by some pigs that broke into it several times, rooting it over in\nplaces. Fourthly, the garden suffered some erosion damage following a heavy\nrainstorm soon after it was planted, while the soil was exposed. (The areas denuded\nof crops by these events are omitted from the yield calculations.) Other data suggest\nthat average yields from newly cleared swiddens may be some three times higher than\nTable 6.

If the mean yield for new\nswiddens is taken, with an average sweet potato energy return of 57,649\u00b791 MJ ha\u00041,\nand it is assumed that the returns on other crops are depressed by a similar factor,\nthere is an overall energy return of 63,165 MJ ha\u00041. Furthermore, the Ganonkiyba\nyields omit the returns from longer term crops such as bananas, sugar cane and\npandans, and also some (albeit small) returns on a few others harvested after the\nyield survey. It can be assumed that the mean energy returns on a newly cultivated\nswidden are three times or more those calculated for the Ganonkiyba garden. This\ngives a more healthy rate of return of fifteen times the energy invested in\nestablishing, cultivating and harvesting a new swidden, which is within the range\nreported for other Melanesian populations, such as the Maring and Enga of\nthe Papua New Guinea highlands (Rappaport, 1972; Waddell, 1972), the\nOk-speaking Miyanmin (Morren, 1977), and on Ontong Java in the Solomon Islands\n(Bayliss-Smith, 1977).\nThe energy returns from established gardens are of the same order as new ones,\nthe Wola asserting that long-established gardens have sweet potato yields similar to,\nand sometimes better than, new ones. The mean yield data of 45,860 MJ ha\u00041 from\nsuch gardens suggest a fall overall, attributable in part to the reduced variety of\ncrops grown and in part to a decline in staple yield, as some gardens near the end\nof their productive lives (Table 7). The rate of return on energy is some ten times\nthat invested, according to these data (see Clarke, 1971, pp. 177\u2013179, for\ncomparative data). The nutritional returns from these crops (Sillitoe, 1983, 240\u2013246)\nare sufficient to maintain a vigorous and expanding population, whatever the\napparent nutritional shortcomings of the diet according to certain authorities,\nnotably deficiencies in protein and calcium intakes (Ferro-Luzzi, Norgan & Paci,\n1981; Koishi, 1990). They suggest greater \u2018affluence\u2019 compared with hunter\u2013gatherer\nfood returns. These calculations assume that the crops grown go to feed the human\npopulation, repaying its energy outlays, supplying it with energy to pursue other\nactivities and sustaining its young members, whereas, as has been seen, people feed\na considerable proportion of their harvest to pigs. They consume somewhere in the\nregion of 47% of the total energy available in harvested crops. The reductions in\nenergy returns to human beings are considerable, more or less halving the energy\ninput to output ratios. But crops fed to pigs are a further food investment, albeit\ninefficient in trophic terms.\nPigs. The calculation of energy returns from pork is not straightforward. Unlike\nthe regular daily labour they put into pig keeping, the Wola eat meat irregularly. They\nmay consume little pork for months at a time and then feast briefly on a glut\nfollowing a large pig-kill festival. On only 7% of days during the household food\nconsumption survey did people eat any pork, at a time when no pig-kills occurred in\ntheir vicinity (Sillitoe, 1983, p. 239). These data may be taken to represent everyday\npork consumption between infrequent pig-kills. The total weight of cooked meat eaten\nwas 89\u00b77 kg. If it is assumed that men and women ate the same amounts of meat, and\nfor calculation purposes that children ate one-half the adults\u2019 share, average adult\n450 P. Sillitoe\npork consumption for this sample was 22\u00b75 g a day. These findings agree with Hide\u2019s\n(1981, p. 507) for the Sinasina: \u2018households consumed pork, on average, once a\nfortnight . . . approximately 1 kg of pork per fortnight\u2019. In the Mendi valley families\nconsume pork more often, i.e. five times a month (Lederman, 1986, p. 256). See also\nTable 1 in Malynicz (1970, p. 203), which gives a range of 0\u00b76\u201319 g of pork consumed\ndaily per head among the Chimbu.\nIf it is assumed that the meat comprises one-half fat and one-half lean pork, which\nis reasonable with the high fat content of Wola pigs, nutritional returns can be\ncalculated using published food values (Table 1). According to these calculations,\nsuch a \u2018daily intake\u2019 of pig meat and fat supplies 3\u00b74 g of protein and has an energy\nvalue of 322 kJ. These figures may serve for purposes of academic comparison, taken\nto represent some average level of household pork consumption, but it is necessary\nto be aware of their hypothetical status. On many days households consumed no\npork. Furthermore the amounts of pork eaten during the survey period varied\nconsiderably between households, from 29 kg in one homestead to a mere 0\u00b72 kg in\nanother (Sillitoe, 1983, p. 234). The differences increase by another order of\nmagnitude in the few days immediately after a large pig-kill. At this time individuals\nmay eat several kilograms of meat and fat, putting their protein and energy intakes\nabove 150 g and 15,000 kJ a day, with concomitant increased body fat storage and\nsome excretion of excess amino groups (Pellett & Young, 1991; S. J. Ulijaszek,\npersonal communication). This glut pattern of meat consumption has long intrigued\nethnographers, among other observers, as a puzzling nutritional practice (e.g. Vayda,\nLeeds & Smith, 1961).\nAnother intriguing aspect of the pig-herding regime is that people keep some adult\npigs alive for years after they reach maturity. The energetic costs are considerable. If,\nfor the sake of argument, it is assumed that the energy expended in herding pigs by\nwomen and men is spread equally between all the animals they herd, a single animal\ndemands 187 kJ a day. (This figure is considerably less than Rappaport\u2019s (1968,\np. 157) estimate of 525 kJ for the Maring.) While pigs are slow to grow, they reach\na reasonable size within 2 years, by which time they will have demanded an energy\ninvestment of 137 MJ. If kept until they reach their maximum adult size, which takes\n5\u20136 years, the investment increases to about 400 MJ. And if people keep animals\nbeyond this time, which they often do, sometimes for 10 years or more, they have to\nexpend 68 MJ for every additional year with little, if any, increase in returns. This\nrepresents a dramatic increase in trophic energy losses. If it is assumed that an\n\u2018average adult beast\u2019 weighs 90 kg at slaughter and that 72% of its carcass yields\nedible products, 50% pork and 50% fat (\u2018killing out\u2019 percentages after Devendra &\nFuller, 1979, p. 127), it will yield 8\u00b71 kg of protein and 612 MJ of energy. (Both\nprotein and energy adjusted to estimated uncooked values, assuming a 4:3 difference\nbetween cooked:uncooked.) After herding a pig for 9 years or so, people enter into\nan energy deficit relationship with the animal, putting in more energy herding it than\nthey will obtain in return when they slaughter and consume it. Keeping adult animals\nis folly from the perspective of production and nutrition. But the Wola keep their pigs\nfor other important culturally determined reasons, exchanging them in socio-political\ntransactions. That they can afford such energetically costly practices is a further\nindication of relative affluence.\nCost of living in the Papua New Guinea highlands 451\nHunting. Energy returns on hunting are equally inefficient. According to the diary\ndata, men who made 329 hunting trips of 7\u00b722 h average duration were successful on\n23% of them, returning with a total of 122 animals (excluding eggs and larvae). The\naverage returns for a trip were 91 g of meat. Many of the animals were small (birds\nlargely), and on only 8% of trips did hunters return with >200 g of game (Table 8).\nExpressed in time, men returned with 252 g of meat for about every 20 h hunting.\nThere are relatively few published nutritional values for any New Guinean animals,\nand none for many in the highlands. This paper uses food values from analyses on\na few animals caught elsewhere, and extends those for one species to several others\nTable 8.

Sillitoe\n(see Table 1). (Table 1 also gives the proportion of the animals eaten, allowing for\nbone, fur, feather, claw and other waste (see Dwyer, 1980, 1985a, b).) This information\nis used to convert the bag weight to that eaten. Furthermore the published food\nvalues are for cooked meat and the table converts these to nominal raw meat values\nas weighed in the survey, allowing for cooking losses (these estimate calculations\nreduce the values, to compensate for the loss of nutrients in cooking, the reduction\nin water content and the concentration of nutrients.) The published values are\nprobably for flesh, not composites of all edible parts, when different organs such as\nheart, lights and liver will vary in nutrient content. Values will also vary between\nspecies, and even for the same species with the seasons as, according to the Wola, the\nfat they carry changes. They may also vary for animals caught in different locales,\nfeeding on different diets. The dubiety of the values notwithstanding, the calculation\nof nutritional returns is straightforward (Table 8).\nA comparison of energy returned for that expended (Tables 6 and 8) reveals a\nlarge energy loss: for every unit of energy men expend hunting, they secure in return\nmerely one-twenty-fifth. This ratio does not represent the personal energy returns to\nhunters, for they do not consume all they catch, but more usually share it with\nrelatives or give it away entirely to others, social interaction and responsibilities\nfeaturing prominently in the consumption of game (Dwyer, 1985c). The portion\nconsumed by hunters might make up one-hundredth or less of their energy outlay.\nThe Wola are not alone in their low energy returns, although they have the dubious\nhonour of scoring the lowest benefit-to-cost energy ratio for hunting of any\npopulation so far reported in New Guinea. The Siane of the eastern highlands and\nthe Maring of the Jimi Valley evidence similar negative energy balances, albeit they\nare respectively five and sixteen times more efficient than the Wola (Dwyer, 1974,\n1983; Healey, 1990a, b). The difference between these groups may be attributable in\npart, firstly, to the different energy costs ascribed to their activities (Dwyer, 1983,\np. 164, uses an energy cost value one-half of that employed here for the Wola,\npresumably on the grounds that the nocturnal hunting favoured by the Siane is not\nvery strenuous), and secondly, to the inclusion of different activities in the hunting\ntime budgets (the consideration of \u2018non-hunting\u2019 activities for the Wola, such as\nnon-stalking travel through the forest, taking rests, and so on).\nIt is possible that wild plant foods could make up the energy deficit incurred in\nhunting animals. A record was kept of the uncultivated foods collected by men during\nthe hunting trips, and estimates made of those consumed while away in the forest.\nThe principal ones were pandan nuts and fungi, with some tree fern fronds and\nparsley (Table 1 includes some food values for these forest products). They offset the\nhunting losses to some extent (Table 9; this omits what was eaten in the forest) but\na significant deficit remains. These gathered plant foods add about 710 MJ to the\nincome side of the equation, increasing the energy returns\/expenditure ratio to 0\u00b728.\nThis considerable increase in energy returns depends largely on nutritionally rich\npandan nuts, which contribute 98% of this added energy. Wild plant foods would be\nof insignificant nutritional value but for these nuts. These foods help close the\nyawning energy gap between hunting expenditure and returns, but their nutritional\ncontributions are generally low and unpredictable, with occasional high points when\nseasonal pandans yield large numbers of nuts.\nCost of living in the Papua New Guinea highlands 453\nConclusions\nIn the spirit of responding to the sharp student, who after sitting through a lecture\non subsistence energy budgets, asked what had been achieved other than to show that\npeople won enough energy to stay alive, it is worth reviewing what such an energy\naccounting exercise reveals. The evidence confirms the widely held assumption that\nfarming produces more than hunting and gathering for each unit of labour invested,\nmeasured in time or energy. The returns-to-expenditure ratio of 4\u00b73 for the !Kung, for\nexample, is only one-third that of the Wola (Lee, 1968). The implication is greater\naffluence.\nTable 9.

Sillitoe\nThe evidence suggests that the costs of this increased affluence are not borne\nequally by women and men. The highland New Guinea farming system demands\nproportionately more of women\u2019s labour than many hunter\u2013gatherer subsistence\nregimes (Meehan, 1974; Altman, 1984; Kelly, 1995). The energy budget data quantify\nstarkly the gender differences (see also Yamauchi et al., 2000). Women engage almost\ndaily in horticultural activities in highland society, as any visitor to the region soon\nobserves. If the returns on energy investments in cultivating a new garden are\nexpressed according to a 50%\/50% gender division, women see a 7:1 return and men\na 32:1 return on their energy outlays. When the re-cultivation of gardens is considered\nit is seen that women are responsible for some four-fifths of agricultural work\nmeasured according to energy outlay. They are also largely responsible for pig\nmanagement. When labour is compared with pork consumption, women invest some\ntwo and one-half times more energy in pig keeping that they receive back, whereas\nfor men the reverse holds and they receive back three times their energy expenditure.\nOn top of these subsistence demands women bear the burden of reproduction,\nsupporting suckling children for long periods. The energetics approach has been\nemployed to monitor the added demands put on women by pregnancy and lactation,\nand assess reproductive ecology, physiological adaptation, seasonal stress and health\nstatus more generally (e.g. Spencer & Heywood, 1983; Panter-Brick, 1989, 1992;\nUlijaszek, 1995). The cost of living falls inordinately on women. One\u2019s reaction to this\nwill vary depending on ideological viewpoint. Some see it as yet another example,\nfrom the Western feminist perspective, of the unfair exploitation of women by men\n(Josephides, 1985; Modjeska, 1982, 1995), others as an aspect of the Melanesian\nconstruction of the person (Lederman, 1986; Strathern, 1988), or as an integral aspect\nof the society\u2019s acephalous constitution which, rather than reflecting exploitation,\nobviates it (Sillitoe, 1985).\nHorticultural production allows people to invest surplus or waste produce in\nraising valuable domestic animals, which they may manage in ergonomically\ninefficient ways, although culturally highly esteemed ones. These activities indicate a\ncertain affluence. The energy calculations underline the singularity of pig production\nin the New Guinea highlands. It is not necessarily energetically negative, people\nkilling many pigs before they incur an energy deficit, harvesting an investment. The\ndata quantify the value put on pigs, their nutritionally rich meat making them apt\nstores of wealth, converters of poor quality small and stringy tubers unfit for human\nconsumption into high value food. Pig-keeping arrangements alert us to handle the\nnotion of production with care because, from a capitalist economic perspective, Wola\nbehaviour seems illogical. Large pigs are at a premium. They comprise the most\nvaluable wealth that people transact in the socio-political exchanges that occupy a\ncentral place in their lives (Sillitoe, 1979b). The energy invested in them contributes\nto this value. They are not merely stores of protein-rich food but symbols of\nsocio-political success. Pig-kill festivals are the apotheosis of socio-political exchange.\nThe logic driving them is not so much nutritional as transactional. While people are\nreluctant to dispose of highly valued pigs piecemeal in everyday family consumption,\nthey willingly slaughter large numbers at occasional events attended by hundreds of\npeople. These are truly grand occasions, celebrations of the exchange ethic, at which\nthousands of pork pieces change hands, men sometimes bedecking themselves festively\nCost of living in the Papua New Guinea highlands 455\nin their finest feather head-dresses and other decorations. They are the realization of\nlarge energy investments within grand social contexts central to the tribal polity.\nKeeping large mature porkers is attractive under this regime, whatever the energy\nbalance implications. Furthermore men describe organizing and participating in time-\nconsuming exchange events as \u2018work\u2019, giving another perspective on gender differences.\nWork is a relative concept, as is affluence (Kaplan, 2000). Working to produce\nsocio-political order is equivalent to working to produce for subsistence needs. It is a\nfurther indication of affluence that society can afford for men to spend so much time\nengaged in such socio-political activities. It is also a function of population density.\nThe hunting data further underline the need for circumspection in drawing upon\ncapitalist concepts of production. They indicate that the Wola population could not\ndepend on hunting for subsistence to any extent and exist. If the question asked by\nUlijaszek & Poraituk (1993) regarding New Guinea sago production, \u2018is it worth the\neffort\u2019, is posed, the answer is \u2018no\u2019. The energy deficit makes it inappropriate to think\nof hunting as a productive activity. The cost\u2013benefit ratio renders the ideas of optimal\nforaging theory that were prominent in hunter\u2013gatherer studies a decade or so ago\nirrelevant (Winterhalder, 1981; Smith, 1983; Dwyer, 1985c). The capitalist-informed\nnotion of optimality suggests that they should stop hunting altogether. An entirely\ndifferent cultural logic again informs behaviour. It is more akin to a pastime, as\nBulmer concluded some time ago: \u2018Hunting is a sport, a game, in which man pits\nhimself against animate, if non-human, adversaries,\u2019 (1968, p. 302). Undertaken by\nmen largely, it scarcely qualifies as a subsistence activity, compared with women\u2019s\nproductive endeavours. Again it is arguable that the practice of hunting is a sign of\naffluence in the wildlife-poor mountain forests of New Guinea, the subsistence regime\nallowing people to engage in such an energetically costly productive activity. The\nimplications of the energy data discussed are not necessarily that the ancestors of New\nGuinea highlanders discovered a more efficient subsistence regime in horticulture,\nevolving from hunter\u2013gatherers to farmers. The hunting and gathering returns are so\nlow as to question the viability of a foraging lifestyle in this region. Whether one\nsubscribes to the affluent hunter\u2013gatherer image or not, it may never have been an\noption for those inhabiting the mountain forests of New Guinea.\nThese energy calculations underscore the need to set subsistence arrangements in\nwider sociocultural context. This is to approach energetics from a non-biological\nperspective. Studies of human ecology, with their widespread focus on adaptation,\nhave been labelled neofunctionalist. They have been the target of criticisms long\nlevelled at functionalism, of thinking too narrowly about human behaviour, if not\nappearing to reduce it to satisfying biological needs for food, shelter, reproduction and\nso on (in the manner, for example, of the renowned ethnographer Malinowski\u2019s 1944\nastonishingly deterministic functional theory). It is widely agreed that many aspects of\nhuman culture and behaviour have no ready connection with adaptation (Burnham,\n1982; Morphy, 1993). Human energy acquisition and expenditure relate to far more\nthan material issues centring on environmental relations, subsistence activities and\nhealth status. Energy accounting can usefully throw anomalies into quantitative relief,\nstressing the need to understand subsistence arrangements, such as swidden agricul-\nture, pig herding and hunting practices, in relation to other logics of production, and\nto approach with caution associated contestable concepts such as affluence.\n456 P.
