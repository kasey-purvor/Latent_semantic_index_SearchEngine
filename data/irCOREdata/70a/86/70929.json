INTRODUCTION\nTime-dependent Hamiltonian systems have received\nmuch attention in recent years,1,2 leading to significant ad-\nvances toward a qualitative and quantitative understanding of\ntheir behavior over long times. In particular, the character-\nization of time evolution for an ensemble of slightly different\ninitial conditions allows one to observe the phenomenon of\nsensitivity to initial conditions, sometimes known as\nunpredictability.3 If the time evolution of the system be-\ncomes radically different as the result of slightly changed\ninitial condition, it is an indication that the system has cha-\notic components. In many cases, such problems may be de-\nscribed in terms of area-preserving maps. The phase space\nmay then include invariant spanning curves and KAM is-\nlands surrounded by a chaotic sea that may be characterized\nvia Lyapunov exponents.4 Behavior of this kind \u0001with a\nmixed phase space structure\u0002 is indeed generic for nondegen-\nerate Hamiltonian systems and has been observed for prob-\nlems with time-dependent potentials,5,6 mesoscopic\nsystems,7,8 waveguides,9 and for a wide class of billiards\nwith a variety of boundaries.10\u201313 For the billiards problems,\nit is assumed that the particle moves freely inside a fixed\nboundary with which it collides elastically. In the formalism\nof Hamiltonian systems, the boundary is assumed to be a\nbarrier of infinite height. If the boundary were time-\ndependent, however, the scenario observed could become\nvery different. In special cases, the particle experiences the\nphenomenon of Fermi acceleration and exhibits unlimited\nenergy growth. See Ref. 14 for specific examples.\nParticular effort has been devoted to understanding the\nproblem of a particle interacting with potentials of different\nkinds. The special interest in studying these systems arises\nbecause they are accessible to a variety of formalisms and\napproaches. Moreover, not only the classical but also the\ncorresponding quantum versions of each system can be\ntreated. Thus, both theoretical and experimental results have\nbeen obtained for a quantum particle interacting with a\npotential-like barrier. These include the frequency depen-\ndence of the tunneling time,15 the transmission probability\nspectrum in a driven triple diode in the presence of a periodic\nexternal field,16 photon-assisted tunneling through a\nGaAs\/AlxGa1\u2212xAs quantum dot induced by an external mi-\ncrowave field,17 sequential tunneling in a superlattice in-\nduced by an intense electric field,18 electron transmission\nresonance above a quantum well due to dissipation,19 and the\nprobability of dissipative tunneling in Josephson junction\ncircuits.20 For the classical case, in particular for systems in\nwhich a classical particle interacts with a time-dependent po-\ntential, different formalisms were developed, including treat-\nments of the problem of a time-modulated barrier5,21,22 and\nof a classical particle in a time-dependent oscillating\nwell.23,24 Consideration of the dynamics of these problems in\nthe presence of noise has recently led to exact descriptions of\ndiffusion within static single and double-square well\npotentials,25,26 the introduction of an external field for two-\nlevel systems in a classical potential,27 a general solution of\nthe problem of activated escape in periodically driven\nsystems,28 analytic solutions for the problem of a piecewise\nbistable potential in the limit of weak external perturbation,29\ncalculation of the escape flux from a multiwell metastable\npotential at times preceding the formation of\nquasiequilibrium,30 activation over a randomly fluctuatinga\u0002Electronic mail: e.leonel@lancaster.ac.uk\nCHAOS 15, 033701 \u00012005\u0002\n1054-1500\/2005\/15\u00023\u0001\/033701\/7\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics15, 033701-1\nbarrier,31,32 and diffusion across a randomly fluctuating\nbarrier.33\nIn this paper we revisit the problem of a classical particle\ninteracting with an infinitely deep potential well containing a\nperiodically oscillating square well, with the aim of describ-\ning some of its scaling properties. We will concentrate on the\nchaotic low energy region, describing the variance of the\naverage energy by use of a scaling function. The particular\nformalism we use was motivated by results obtained from\nsurface science,34 and it is one that has already proved valu-\nable in the characterization of chaotic systems.35 It could also\nbe useful in application to billiards problems. Using the\nroughening concept, we obtain a scaling function as well as\ncritical exponents for chaotic low energy time series. The\nscaling function is confirmed by a convincing collapse of\nroughness data for a large range of different control param-\neters onto a single universal curve, as we shall see.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe\nhow the map is constructed. The numerical results and scal-\ning properties are discussed in Sec. III while Sec. IV sum-\nmarizes our results and presents concluding remarks.\nII. THE MODEL AND MAP DERIVATION\nWe consider a particle moving inside an infinite potential\nbox that contains a periodically oscillating square well. The\nsystem is described by the Hamiltonian H\u0001x , p , t\u0002= p2 \/2m\n+V\u0001x , t\u0002, where V\u0001x , t\u0002 is the potential within which the par-\nticle remains confined. It is written as\nV\u0001x,t\u0002\n=\u0005\n\u0001 if x\u0002 0 or x\u0003 a + b\nV0 if 0\u0004 x\u0004\nb\n2\nor \u0006a + b2\u0007\u0004 x\u0004 \u0001a + b\u0002\nD cos\u0001wt\u0002 if\nb\n2\n\u0004 x\u0004 \u0006a + b2\u0007 , \b\nwhere V0, a, b, D, and w are constants. In what follows,\nallusions to \u201cthe well\u201d refer to the central oscillating part of\nthe potential V\u0001x , t\u0002, which is sketched in Fig. 1. Note that\nthis particular geometry for the potential V\u0001x , t\u0002 makes it\nequivalent to the problem of an infinite chain of oscillating\nsquare wells,24 and similar to the problem of a single oscil-\nlating square well with periodic boundary conditions. This\nkind of potential can be related directly to mesoscopic\nsystems16 with time-dependent potentials16,19 with the square\nwell representing, e.g., the conduction band for a\nGaAs\/AlxGa1\u2212xAs heterostructure with the time-dependent\npotential representing the electron-phonon interaction.36 Fur-\nthermore, as indicated earlier, the formalism used to derive\nthe scaling relation for the chaotic low energy region in this\nproblem is directly applicable to billiards problems. The\nsame formalism was recently used for investigation of the\nchaotic sea in the Fermi\u2013Ulam accelerator model.35\nWe now construct the map describing the dynamics of\nthis system. We follow basically the same general\nprocedures22 recently applied5 to investigate classical dy-\nnamics within a time-modulated barrier. See also Ref. 23 for\nthe problem of an oscillating single well, and Ref. 6 for the\nproblem of an oscillating double square well. Note that the\npresent system only differs from that discussed in Ref. 5 by\nvirtue of the fact that here the central part of the potential is\na well, whereas in Ref. 5 it was a barrier. However, this\napparently minor difference in the potential may be expected\nto produce profound differences in the dynamics of the par-\nticle. In Ref. 5 the particle needed to surmount a central\n\u0001oscillating\u0002 barrier in the potential, and thus spent signifi-\ncant time with its motion effectively restricted to either one\nor other side of the barrier; in the present case, there is no\nbarrier, but a narrower and deeper \u0001oscillating\u0002 central por-\ntion of the potential where the particle may sometimes be\nconfined. Despite the apparent similarity of the two poten-\ntials, therefore, there is no a priori reason to expect any\nparticular similarity in the dynamics. Nonetheless, as we will\ndemonstrate in the following there are a number of striking\nsimilarities, and we will argue that they point to universality\nin the behavior of these kinds of systems. We will use critical\nexponents obtained for the scaling function describing the\nroughness for these two systems, and results for the traversal\ntime and successive reflection numbers and times, to support\nthe universality hypothesis.\nWe will consider as dynamical variables both the total\nenergy of the particle E and the time t measured from when\nthe particle enters the well. Suppose that, at a time t= tn, the\nparticle is at the entrance of the well with total energy E\n=En. The formalism described here is applicable to entrance\nfrom either side of the well. When the particle enters the\nwell, it suffers an abrupt change in its kinetic energy, which\ncan be written as Kn\u0001=En\u2212D cos\u0001wtn\u0002. Once it is inside the\nwell, the particle experiences no forces, and it moves freely\nwith a constant velocity of modulus \tvn\u0001\t=\n2Kn\u0001 \/m. After\ntraveling a distance a in a time tn\u0001=a \/ \tvn\u0001\t, the particle reaches\nthe other side of the well. The total energy of the particle is\nthen En\u0001=Kn\u0001+D cos\u0003w\u0001tn+ tn\u0001\u0002\u0004. At this point, two different\nthings may occur: \u0001a\u0002 if the particle has insufficient energy to\nescape from the well, it will be reflected back with same\nkinetic energy. In this case, En\u0001\u0004V0. \u0001b\u0002 The particle escapes\nfrom the well, i.e., En\u0001\u0005V0. Let us first discuss case \u0001a\u0002. If the\nparticle is reflected it will eventually reach the other side of\nthe well. At this time, its total energy is En\u0001=Kn\u0001\n+D cos\u0003w\u0001tn+2tn\u0001\u0002\u0004. But if En\u0001\u0004V0, the particle is reflected\nFIG. 1. Sketch of the potential V\u0001x , t\u0002 under consideration.\n033701-2 E. D. Leonel and P. V. E. McClintock Chaos 15, 033701 \u00022005\u0001\nback again, and so on until the following condition is satis-\nfied:\nEn\u0001 = Kn\u0001 + D cos\u0003w\u0001tn + itn\u0001\u0002\u0004\u0005 V0. \u00011\u0002\nHere, i is the smaller integer for which Eq. \u00011\u0002 is true. Exit-\ning the well, case \u0001b\u0002 then applies. The particle again suffers\nan abrupt change in its kinetic energy so that the new relation\nis Kn\u0002=En\u0001\u2212V0. In this case, the corresponding velocity is\ngiven by \tvn\u0002\t=\n2Kn\u0002 \/m. The particle thus travels a distance\nb \/2 until it suffers an elastic collision with the infinite po-\ntential wall, from which it is reflected back with same kinetic\nenergy Kn\u0002. As it returns, it travels the distance b \/2 until it\nagain enters the well. The time spent in this part of its tra-\njectory is tn\u0002=b \/ \tvn\u0002\t. The map is therefore given by\nT:\u000bEn+1 = En + D\u0003cos\u0001w\u0001tn + itn\u0001\u0002\u0002 \u2212 cos\u0001wtn\u0002\u0004\ntn+1 = tn + itn\u0001 + tn\u0002,\n\f\nwhere i is obtained as the smallest integer for which Eq. \u00011\u0002\nis true \u0001see above\u0002.\nThis form of the map involves an excessive number of\ncontrol parameters. There are five in total, namely a, b, D,\nV0, and w. So it is advantageous to transform to dimension-\nless and more convenient variables. We will define en\n=En \/V0, \u0006=D \/V0, and r=b \/a. In practice it is convenient to\nmeasure time in terms of the period of oscillation of the\nmoving well, so \u0007n=wtn. We can also define a parameter Nc\ngiven by\nNc =\nwa\n2\b\n\n m\n2V0\n. \u00012\u0002\nThe parameter Nc deserves a more detailed discussion. The\nterm a \/\n2V0 \/m=\tc can be interpreted as being the time a\nparticle spends in traveling a distance a with kinetic energy\nK=V0. Related to this time, we can define a characteristic\nfrequency \nc=2\b \/\tc and then rewrite Eq. \u00012\u0002 as Nc=w \/\nc.\nThese considerations tell us that the parameter Nc represents\nthe number of oscillations that the square well completes in a\ntime t=\tc. With these parameters, the map becomes\nT:\u000ben+1 = en + \u0006\u0003cos\u0001\u0007n + i\u000b\u0007a\u0002 \u2212 cos\u0001\u0007n\u0002\u0004\n\u0007n+1 = \u0007n + i\u000b\u0007a + \u000b\u0007bmod 2\b ,\n\f \u00013\u0002\nwhere the auxiliary variables are given by\n\u000b\u0007a =\n2\bNc\n\nen \u2212 \u0006 cos\u0001\u0007n\u0002\n,\n\u000b\u0007b =\n2\bNcr\n\nen + \u0006\u0003cos\u0001\u0007n + i\u000b\u0007a\u0002 \u2212 cos\u0001\u0007n\u0002\u0004 \u2212 1\n,\nand i is the smallest integer number that makes the following\nequation true:\nen + \u0006\u0003cos\u0001\u0007n + i\u000b\u0007a\u0002 \u2212 cos\u0001\u0007n\u0002\u0004\u0005 1. \u00014\u0002\nThe map T \u0003see Eq. \u00013\u0002\u0004 is area preserving because Det J\n=1 where J is the Jacobian matrix.\nThe phase space for this problem is shown to have a\nhierarchy of behaviors, including: \u0001a\u0002 a chaotic sea at low\nenergy; \u0001b\u0002 KAM islands; and \u0001c\u0002 invariant spanning curves.\nSee, for example, Refs. 23 and 24.\nWe will concentrate on the scaling behavior present in\nthe chaotic sea at low energy. We use an extension of the\nformalism derived from surface science34 to investigate the\nbehavior of the variance of the average energy which we will\nthen refer to as the roughness, \n. Application of this ap-\nproach to the analysis of the time evolution of chaotic\ntime-series35 has already led to a number of interesting re-\nsults. We thus discuss in this paper the results of the rough-\nness as function of the control parameter Nc \u0001see the above-\ngiven definition\u0002 and the connections with the previous\nresults in the literature for a sort of system. Therefore, the\nresults obtained as function of the control parameter \u0006 allow\nus to characterize a special transition in this system.\nFigure 2 shows the time series for a particular initial\ncondition in the chaotic sea. It is immediately apparent that\nthe time series looks rather similar, regardless of how the\nabscissa is expanded, suggesting scaling behavior. Figure 2\nwas constructed using the parameters \u0006=0.5, r=1, and Nc\n=33.18. Before formally defining the roughness, we first dis-\ncuss the control parameters. The phase space must depend on\n\u0006, Nc, and r because the map T is explicitly dependent on all\nthree parameters. However, we will consider in this paper the\ncase of a symmetrical potential, i.e., the case in which a=b,\nequivalent to taking r=1. Results for the case r\u00031 will be\npublished elsewhere.\nIn order to study the roughness, we first evaluate the\nenergy \u0001in the chaotic sea at low energy domain\u0002 averaged\nover the orbit generated from one initial condition as\nFIG. 2. Time evolution of the energy e from one initial condition in the\nchaotic sea with the control parameters \u0006=0.5, r=1, and Nc=33.18. Note the\nwidely differing abscissa scale expansions and that e\u0001n\u0002 appears\nscale-independent.\n033701-3 Scaling properties for a classical Chaos 15, 033701 \u00022005\u0001\ne\u00af\u0001n,\u0006,Nc\u0002 =\n1\nn\n\r\ni=1\nn\nei, \u00015\u0002\nand then evaluate the interface width around this averaged\nenergy. The roughness is then defined as\n\n\u0001n,\u0006,Nc\u0002 \u000e\n1\nM\rj=1\nM\n\ne2j\u0001n,\u0006,Nc\u0002 \u2212 e\u00afj2\u0001n,\u0006,Nc\u0002 , \u00016\u0002\nwhere we have considered an ensemble of M different initial\nconditions on the chaotic sea. The scaling for the roughness\nwill be discussed in Sec. III.\nIII. SCALING PROPERTIES\nWe will discuss the results obtained for the scaling in the\nchaotic sea as functions of each of the parameters \u0006 and Nc.\nWe start by considering the dependence on Nc.\nA. Scaling as function of Nc\nA scaling analysis for the roughness as a function of Nc\nhas been completed. It was carried out in a very similar way\nto that already presented in Ref. 5 so we discuss only the\nmain points here, rather than providing the detailed argu-\nments and demonstrating all the intermediate steps. As in\nRef. 5, the roughness can be described formally in terms of a\nscaling function given by\n\n\u0001n,Nc\u0002 = l\n\u0001la1n,lb1Nc\u0002 , \u00017\u0002\nwhere l is the scaling factor and a1 and b1 are the scaling\ndimensions. The exponents a1 and b1 should be related to the\ncharacteristic exponents \f1 \u0001roughening exponent\u0002, \r1\n\u0001growth exponent\u0002, and z1 \u0001dynamical exponent\u0002. Indeed,\ntheir relations are \u22121\/a1=\r1, \u22121\/b1=\f1. We also obtain that\nthe critical exponents are related by\nz1 =\na1\nb1\n=\n\f1\n\r1\n. \u00018\u0002\nFollowing the procedures already described,5 we obtain\n\f1=0.667\u00012\u0002, \r1=0.50\u00011\u0002 \u0001averaged over many roughness\ncurves in a large window of Nc\u0002, and z1=1.318\u00019\u0002. We can\nalso compare the numerical result obtained for z1 with the\nresult from Eq. \u00018\u0002. Evaluating Eq. \u00018\u0002 using both the previ-\nous results for the exponents \f1 and \r1, we obtain z1\n=1.33\u00012\u0002, which compares well with the above-presented nu-\nmerical result.\nAs a final check on the validity of the scaling function\nand critical exponents, we collapse different roughness\ncurves onto a single and universal roughness plot, as shown\nin Fig. 3 for different control parameters.\nBefore moving to the next section, we discuss the appli-\ncability of these exponents \u0001\f1 ,\r1 ,z1\u0002 to other systems. It is\ninteresting to note that the results discussed here and those\npresented in Refs. 5 and 6 were all, in a sense, obtained as\nfunctions of the oscillation frequency. An increase of the\nfrequency is quite equivalent to an increase in the \u201cstochas-\nticity\u201d of these systems. Consequently, many of their observ-\nables require far more iteration to approach asymptotic val-\nues as compared to results obtained for lower oscillation\nfrequencies. The rise in the lowest energy invariant spanning\ncurve also implies an increase of the roughness saturation\nvalue. We can however observe that the roughness exponent\n\r1 seems to be independent of frequency and assumes the\nsame value in different systems \u0001cf. results for Refs. 5 and 6\u0002.\nIn the case of the Fermi accelerator model, we have already\ndemonstrated the existence of a situation35 in which the ex-\nponent \r does indeed depend on the initial velocity. We can\neven conclude that, within a range of uncertainty, the expo-\nnents \f1 and z1 obtained in this section are identical to those\nobtained in Refs. 5 and 6. The implication is that such expo-\nnents may be valuable in that they can be used to classify\nsystems as falling within the same universality class. Other\nobservables also contribute to and further support this idea,\nas follows. One can note that, in the problem of a time-\nmodulated barrier,21,22 the traversal time, i.e. the length of\ntime taken by the particle to traverse the oscillating barrier,\nobeys a power law distribution of exponent \u22123. The same\nexponent has also been obtained for the distribution of suc-\ncessive reflection numbers and times for different periodic\nsystems, including an oscillating single square well,23 a time-\nmodulated barrier,5 and a double-square well potential.6 The\nauthors of Ref. 23 also introduced an analytic approach to\njustify the exponent \u22123 for the case of a single square well\nmoving randomly. These results, together with those ob-\ntained for the roughness and in relation to the exponents \f1\nand z1, lend support to our hypothesis that such systems \u0001i.e.,\nat least those discussed in Refs. 5, 6, and 21\u201323 and even\nRef. 24 for the case of infinite oscillating square wells\u0002 all\nbelong to the same class of universality.\nIn the next section, we investigate for the first time how\nthe roughness varies as a function of the depth of the oscil-\nlating potential.\nFIG. 3. \u0001a\u0002 Roughness \n as a function of n for different values of Nc. \u0001b\u0002\nTheir collapse onto both the same saturation value and same crossover it-\neration number. For details, see Ref. 5.\n033701-4 E. D. Leonel and P. V. E. McClintock Chaos 15, 033701 \u00022005\u0001\nB. Scaling as function of \u0001\nWe now consider the behavior of the roughness as a\nfunction of the control parameter \u0006. Evaluation of Eq. \u00016\u0002 for\ndifferent values of \u0006 is shown in Fig. 4, where we have taken\na fixed value of the parameter Nc=795.77. Note however that\ndifferent values of \u0006 generates different roughness curves for\nsmall n, as can be seen in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002. Such behavior indicates\nthat n is not a scaling variable. However, we can apply the\ntransformation n\u2192n\u00062 and thus observe that it coalesces\nboth the curves for small n. This procedure is illustrated in\nFig. 4\u0001b\u0002. Figure 4 was obtained by averaging 104 different\ninitial phases and the same initial energy e0=1.001, all of\nthem leading to chaotic behavior.\nAs discussed in Ref. 5, it is easy to see in Fig. 4 that the\nroughness grows for small n, and then tends toward the satu-\nration value as the iteration number becomes large enough.\nThe change in growth rate marking the approach to satura-\ntion is characterized by a crossover iteration number. This\ndiscussion allows us to characterize the roughness as a func-\ntion of the control parameter \u0006, in a similar way to that used\nfor Nc in Sec. III A. We therefore suppose the following.\n\u00011\u0002 After a brief initial transient and considering short\niterations, the roughness is described as\n\n\u0001n\u00062,\u0006\u0002 \u000e \u0003n\u00062\u0004\r2, \u00019\u0002\nwhere \r2 is the growth exponent. Equation \u00019\u0002 is valid for\nn\u000fnx.\n\u00012\u0002 Considering large enough iteration number, the satu-\nration of roughness is given by\n\nsat\u0001n\u00062,\u0006\u0002 \u000e \u0006\f2, \u000110\u0002\nwhere \f2 is the roughening exponent and Eq. \u000110\u0002 is valid for\nn\u0010nx.\n\u00013\u0002 The crossover iteration number nx characterizing the\nchange of growing and marking the approach to the satura-\ntion regime is given by\nnx\u0001\u0006\u0002 \u000e \u0006z2, \u000111\u0002\nwhere z2 is the dynamical exponent.\nIn light of these three initial suppositions, the scaling\nfunction describing the roughness can be written as\n\n\u0001n\u00062,\u0006\u0002 = l\n\u0001la2n\u00062,lb2\u0006\u0002 , \u000112\u0002\nwhere a2 and b2 are the scaling dimensions and l is the\nscaling factor. As discussed earlier, the exponents a2 and b2\ncan be related to the characteristic exponents \f2, \r2, and z2.\nTo do so, we first write the scaling factor as l= \u0003n\u00062\u0004\u0001\u22121\/a2\u0002.\nWith this choice, we can rewrite Eq. \u000112\u0002 as\n\n\u0001n\u00062,\u0006\u0002 = \u0003n\u00062\u0004\u0001\u22121\/a2\u0002\n1\u0001\u0003n\u00062\u0004\u0001b2\/a2\u0002\u0006\u0002 . \u000113\u0002\nWe define the function \n1=\n\u00011, \u0003n\u00062\u0004\u0001b2\/a2\u0002\u0006\u0002 and suppose it\nto be constant for n\u000fnx. Comparing Eqs. \u00019\u0002 and \u000113\u0002 we\nfind that \u22121\/a2=\r2. We now choose the scaling factor to be\nl=\u0006\u0001\u22121\/b2\u0002. This allows us to rewrite Eq. \u000112\u0002 as\n\n\u0001n\u00062,\u0006\u0002 = \u0006\u0001\u22121\/b2\u0002\n2\u0001\u0006\u0001a2\/b2\u0002n\u00062\u0002 . \u000114\u0002\nThe function \n2=\n\u0001\u0006\u0001a2\/b2\u0002n\u00062 ,1\u0002 and it is supposed constant\nfor n\u0010nx. A direct comparison of Eqs. \u000110\u0002 and \u000114\u0002 shows\nthat \u22121\/b2=\f2. To obtain the relationship between the criti-\ncal exponents, we must consider the two different previous\nexpressions for the scaling factor l. We can thus write\nn = \u0006\u0001a2\/b2\u0002\u22122. \u000115\u0002\nFinally, comparing Eqs. \u000111\u0002 and \u000115\u0002, we obtain\nz2 =\na2\nb2\n\u2212 2 =\n\f2\n\r2\n\u2212 2. \u000116\u0002\nFigure 5 shows the behavior of the saturated roughness \nsat\nFIG. 4. Behavior of the roughness \n for an ensemble of 104 initial condi-\ntions. The control parameters used were Nc=795.77 and two different values\nof \u0006, namely \u0006=0.005 and \u0006=0.05. In \u0001a\u0002, the roughness is plotted against\nthe iteration number n while \u0001b\u0002 plots the roughness as a function of n\u00062.\nFIG. 5. \u0001a\u0002 Plot of the saturation roughness \nsat against the control param-\neter \u0006. \u0001b\u0002 The crossover iteration number as a function of \u0006. In each case,\nwe consider three different fixed values of the control parameter Nc, as\nindicated in \u0001a\u0002.\n033701-5 Scaling properties for a classical Chaos 15, 033701 \u00022005\u0001\nand the corresponding crossover iteration number nx as func-\ntions of the parameter \u0006 for three different values of the\ncontrol parameter Nc, as indicated in the figure. We can see\nhowever that the curves for both \nsat and nx undergo a\nmarked change in behavior near the value \u0006\u000f0.2. For curves\nshowing such a transition, we can still obtain numerically\nsets of the exponents \f2, \r2, and z2 separately for each of the\ntwo distinct regions. It is easy to see in Fig. 5 that the slope\nfor each curve is quite different before and after the transi-\ntion. The corresponding critical exponents \f2 and z2 are\nshown in Table I. After averaging over all the time series, we\nfind that the exponent \r2=0.498\u00013\u0002. Note that this result al-\nlows us to conclude that both the growth exponents are the\nsame, i.e., \r1=\r2=1\/2 for those sets of initial conditions\ndiscussed in the beginning of this section. It also assumes the\nsame value in Refs. 5 and 6 and for the case where the initial\nvelocities are very low in the Fermi accelerator model.35\nWe now compare the numerical results obtained for the\ncritical exponents with the analytic relation Eq. \u000116\u0002. Before\ndoing so, we first compute the average values of critical ex-\nponents obtained for the three different values of Nc before\nand after the transition. Considering the roughness exponent\nbefore the transition, we find that its average value is \f\u00af2b\n=0.732\u00018\u0002 and the dynamical exponent is z\u00af2b=\u22120.57\u00012\u0002. After\nthe transition, the exponents are given by \f\u00af2a=0.366\u00012\u0002 and\nz\u00af2\na\n=\u22121.28\u00014\u0002.\nEvaluating Eq. \u000116\u0002, and taking into account the average\nvalues for \f2 and \r2, we find: \u0001i\u0002 that before the transition\nz2=\u22120.531\u00017\u0002 and \u0001ii\u0002 that after the transition z2=\u22121.265\u00011\u0002.\nOur results show relatively good agreement for the expo-\nnents obtained both before and after the transition.\nAs a final check on the validity of this discussion, we try\nto collapse the roughness curves for different control param-\neters, considering the two different values obtained for the\ncorresponding exponents \f2 and z2, as shown in Fig. 6. Fig-\nures 6\u0001a\u0002 and 6\u0001b\u0002 show results for the dynamics before the\ntransition, while Figs. 6\u0001c\u0002 and 6\u0001d\u0002 shows the results after\nthe transition. The collapses obtained in these figures confirm\nthat the critical exponents give good results both before and\nafter the transition.\nLet us now discuss the transition observed near to \u0006\n\u000f0.2. It was shown earlier23 that the spectrum of Lyapunov\nexponents undergoes an abrupt transition as a function of the\ncontrol parameters \u0001see also Ref. 5 for the comparably abrupt\ntransition of the Lyapunov exponent for a classical particle\ninteracting with a time-modulated barrier\u0002. This abrupt tran-\nsition was explained as rising from the destruction of the\nlowest invariant spanning curve and consequently the merg-\ning of two large but different chaotic regions. As we shall\nsee, it is this transition that is responsible for the change in\nthe behavior of the critical exponents. Figure 7\u0001a\u0002, obtained\nfor the control parameters \u0006=0.165 and Nc=159.154, shows\nthe two different large chaotic regions separated by an invari-\nant spanning curve. After a tiny change of the parameter to\n\u0006=0.168, Fig. 7\u0001b\u0002 clearly possesses just a single large cha-\notic region.\nTABLE I.

With the merging of the two dif-\nferent chaotic regions, the particles experience a transient in\nthe previously chaotic region, behavior that affects directly\nthe shape of the roughness curve, as can be seen in Fig. 8 for\nthe control parameter \u0006=0.2. It is easy to see however that,\nimmediately after the transition, where the transient effects\nare stronger, the crossover iteration number is no longer easy\nto obtain and, as the roughness curve presents an extra bend,\nthe collapse for different control parameters cannot occur.\nFigure 8 was obtained using three different values of \u0006 \u0001as\nillustrated in the figure\u0002 and the same Nc=159.154. Figure\n8\u0001a\u0002 shows the three different roughness curves while Fig.\n8\u0001b\u0002 shows the same three curves but, after a brief initial\ntransient and applying the transformation n\u2192n\u00062, that all the\ncurves coalesce together for short iterations. We emphasize\nthat, even where the system undergoes sudden destruction of\ninvariant spanning curves through the merging of at least two\nlarge chaotic regions, resulting in critical exponents that are\ndifferent before and after the transition and when transient\neffects are not observed, the scaling laws given by Eqs. \u00017\u0002\nand \u000112\u0002 still seem to be valid.\nIV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have studied the problem of a classical particle in-\nteracting with an infinitely deep potential well containing a\nsymmetric oscillating square well. The dynamics of the prob-\nlem was described via a two-dimensional nonlinear area-\npreserving map. The chaotic low energy region was charac-\nterized via the formalism of a scaling function for the\nvariance of the average energy \u0001roughness\u0002. We have derived\nanalytic relations for the critical exponents and shown that\nthe expressions depend on which control parameter is being\nconsidered. The connections of the results presented in this\npaper with those previously reported in the literature have\nalso been considered \u0001see the end of Sec. III A\u0002 and their\nwider implications discussed.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was supported by a grant from Conselho\nNacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico\u2014\nCNPq, Brazilian agency.
