Assessing the Use of Prison from an  \nEconomic Perspective  \nKEVIN MARSH, CHRIS FOX and CAROL HEDDERMAN  \nAbstract:  This  article  assesses  the  relative  economic  costs  and  benefits  of  \nalternative sentences.  A  conceptual  economic  model  is  developed  in  which  the  \nbenefits  are  the rehabilitation, incapacitation, deterrence and retribution effects of \nprison. A review of the literature  was  undertaken  to  identify  economic  studies  \nthat  measure  these  effects.  The evidence  available  tends  to  focus  on  costs  \nand  the  rehabilitation  and  incapacitation effects.  The  evidence  on  the  \ndeterrence  effect  takes  two  forms  -  theoretical  models  and empirical  analysis.  \nLittle economic  evidence  on  the  retribution  effect  of  prison  was identified. In \nconclusion, whatever the other reasons put forward for or against the use of prison, it \nis reasonable to conclude that using it for anyone but those convicted of serious \noffences is a waste of public resources.  \nKeywords:  prison; economic; cost-benefit  analysis;  rehabilitation;  incapacitation; \ndeterrence; retribution  \n \nIntroduction \nOver the last 15 years the prison population has risen from 44,000 to over 83,000  -  \na  rise  of  88%.  The  operating  costs  associated  with  managing  a prison  \npopulation  of  this  size  are  around  \u00a32  billion  and  the  government has   recently   \nannounced   plans   to   spend  an   additional   \u00a33.8   billion   on providing a further \n20,000 spaces by 2014. Anyone who argues that this is not  money  well  spent  \nrisks  being  accused  of  being  soft  on  crime  and  uninterested  in  the  \nconsequences  for  victims  (Hedderman  2008).  But  an economic analysis can not \nonly take the actual victim costs of offences into  account,  but  consider  the  \nsavings  to  victims  which  might  accrue  from  favouring  one  sentence  over  \nanother.  It  is,  therefore,  a  good  time  to  ask whether  sending  people  to  prison  \nis  worth  the  cost;  and  how  far  the alternatives offer better or worse value for \nmoney.  \nJustifications for sentencing take two main forms. Retributive justifications   look   \nback   at   the   offence   and   express   disapproval   for what  has happened in the \nform of punishment. The penalty is usually expected to be proportionate  to  the  \noffence  and  the  offender's  degree  of  culpability. Utilitarian  justifications  focus  \non  the  expected  impact  of  a  sentence  to reduce  the  chances  of  such  an  act  \nbeing  committed  again  by  the  same offender,  other  offenders  or  both  \n(Hedderman  2007).  Any  individual sentence  can,  of  course,  be  imposed  with  \n2 \n \nboth  punishment  and  crime reduction  in  mind.  In  the  case  of  imprisonment  \nDiIulio  (1996)  suggests that its use:  \n \n. . . offers at least four types of social benefits. The first is retribution: \nimprisoning Peter   punishes   him   and   expresses   society's   desire   to   \ndo   justice.   Second,   is deterrence:   imprisoning   Peter   may   deter   \neither   him   or   Paul   or   both   from committing crimes in the future. Third is \nrehabilitation: while behind bars, Peter may participate in drug treatment or \nother programs that reduce the chances that he will return to crime when free. \nFourth is incapacitation: from his cell, Peter can't commit crimes against \nanyone save other prisoners, staff or visitors. (p.18)  \nThe Criminal Justice Act 2003 sets out the purposes of sentencing (Section 142(1))  \nand  makes  clear  reference  to  both  reductivist  and  retributivist  rationales. Prior \nto the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the extent to which one or more of these principles \nwas reflected in an individual sentence varied; and  might  be  no  more  than  the  \nimplicit  or  explicit  aspirations  of  the sentencer, which might or might not be \nshared by the offender, the victim, the supervising service or the wider public. The \nlack of a direct or simple connection between the purpose of sentencing and \noutcome may be one of the reasons that research into the impact of sentencing has \nbeen relatively rare. Another reason is that some of these aims are very hard to \nmeasure. For   example,   despite   the   considerable   conceptual   differences   in   \nhow incapacitation   and   deterrence   are   expected   to   operate,   the   lack   of \nadequate  or  agreed  measures  for  either  aim  means  that  reviews  tend  to \nconclude that their effects are not distinguishable from one another (Nagin 1998;  \nVon  Hirsch  et  al.  1999; Carter  2003;  Bottoms  2004).  In both cases reconviction \nrates are used to assess change because it is 'the only readily accessible measure \nof reoffending' (Friendship et al. 2004, p.10).  \nTwo recent developments mean that it is both timely and possible to take a fresh \nlook at sentencing effectiveness. The first is that, in putting the aims of  sentencing  \non  a  statutory  footing,  the  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003  also redefined those aims \nas being the:  \n punishment of offenders;  \n reduction of crime (including its reduction by deterrence);  \n reform and rehabilitation of offenders;  \n protection of the public; and  \n making of reparation by offenders to persons affected by their offence.  \n \nThis redefinition is important in two respects. First, it introduced a specific \nacknowledgement   of   the   victim's   perspective   by   according   reparation \n3 \n \nequivalent status  to  other  sentencing  aims.  Second, the legislation drew attention \nto the potential impact sentencing might have in terms of crime reduction and public \nprotection (Hedderman 2007).  \nThe second development is that economic evaluations of criminal justice \ninterventions, which have historically focused on a fairly narrow range of issues  \nsuch  as  the  cost-benefit  of  early  interventions  (for  example,  Parks 2000),   are   \nnow   being   conducted   in   relation   to   issues   such   as   target hardening crime \nprevention measures (for example, Bowers, Johnson and Hirschfield 2004). Recent \nwork, particularly by Aos et al. (2001) in the US and  Marsh  and  Fox  (2008)  in  the  \nUK,  has  further  expanded  the  field  to cover cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) of \ncriminal sanctions. This recent work also uses more rigorous and sophisticated \nanalytic techniques than did the earlier   work,   for   assessing   both   the   costs   \nand   benefits   of   different sentences, and interventions within a sentence. This \ndevelopment perhaps reflects  the   fact   that   the   earlier   work   was   generally   \nconducted   by criminologists  with  a  little  economic  knowledge  or  advice  rather  \nthan  by economists with some criminological knowledge and advice.  \nIn  this  article  we  review  economic  studies  to  ask  whether,  from  an economic  \nperspective,  prison  is  effective?  We  start  by  reviewing  recent CBA of the \neffectiveness of prison. While the CBAs undertaken vary in the types  of  the  \nbenefits  of  prison  they  capture,  at  best  they  only  capture incapacitation,  \nrehabilitation  and specific  deterrence effects.  The remaining sections turn to \neconomic evidence on the other effects of prison. We review both the economic \ntheory and the studies that attempt to describe and measure general deterrence \neffects. We also include a brief discussion of economic perspectives on retribution. \nFinally we draw conclusions about whether prison represents an efficient use of \npublic resources and suggest areas on which future economic enquiry should focus.  \nCost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)  \nWhat Does a CBA Add to the Debate about the Use of Prisons?  \nCBA is concerned with both measuring the effectiveness of an intervention and   \nwhether   an   intervention   is   efficient   in   that   the   benefits   of   the intervention  \nare  greater  than  the  costs  (Barnett  and  Escobar  1987;  Dhiri and  Brand  1999;  \nCohen  2000;  Welsh  and  Farrington  2000;  Roman  and Butts  2005;  Swaray,  \nBowles  and  Pradiptyo  2005).  In  a  CBA,  the  effects  - the  outcomes  of  an  \nintervention  -  are  valued  in  standardised  monetary units, such as the dollar or the \npound, and compared with the costs of the intervention's inputs. This approach \nallows for a direct comparison of two or more interventions, even if  those  \ninterventions vary  in their goals  and objectives and target heterogeneous \npopulations and outcomes.  \nEconomists put forward a number of arguments in favour of analysing the costs and \nbenefits of criminal justice interventions. First, even though an intervention may yield \n4 \n \npositive outcomes (such as desistance from crime and increases in pro-social \nbehaviour such as getting a job) the cost of the intervention may outweigh the \nintervention's benefits; and an  alternative intervention  may  achieve  the  same  \noutcomes  for  a  lower  cost.  Second, whereas observational studies examine \noutcomes one at a time, CBA considers all outcomes jointly, using the standardised \n(monetised) estimates of costs and benefits as weights that generate a single \nmeasure of intervention effectiveness.   Third,   CBA   allows   for   the   valuation   of   \nhard-to-observe outcomes, such as fear, pain and suffering. Fourth, CBA has the \npotential to account for externalities - outcomes for individuals not directly involved in \nthe  intervention,  but  who  are  nevertheless  affected  by  its  results.  Finally, since  \npublic  resources  are  scarce,  it  is  incumbent  upon  policy  makers  to choose the \nmost efficient intervention, that is, the scheme where costs are minimised and \nbenefits are maximised (Cohen 2000).  \nMarsh,  Chalfin  and  Roman  (2008)  have  illustrated  the  importance  of CBA  to  \ndecision  making  in  criminal  justice.  They  demonstrate  that  the effect of a \ncriminal justice intervention at reducing offending is only weakly related to net \nbenefits  in terms of savings  to the Exchequer and\/or wider society and that in about \none-quarter of cases, considering both costs and benefits would produce a different \npolicy recommendation as opposed to just analysing changes in offending rates.  \nDespite the advantages of CBA, to date there have been few economic evaluations  \nof  criminal  justice  interventions  (DiIulio  1996;  Cohen  2000; Brown 2004; \nBushway and Reuter 2005). This dearth of economic analysis is  illustrated  by  \nMcDougall  et  al.'s  (2003)  review  of  economic  analysis  of sentencing options, \nwhich identified just nine CBAs.  \nThis  lack  of  economic  analysis  in  criminal  justice  is  in  contrast  to  a number of \nother policy areas, in particular health care. In the UK, all new health  technologies  \nhave  to  be  approved  by  the  National  Institute  for Health and Clinical Excellence \n(NICE). As part of the appraisal undertaken by   NICE   to   inform   their   \nrecommendations,   an   economic   analysis   is undertaken   to   determine   both   \nthe   costs   and   benefits   of   the   new interventions.  NICE  employ  a  cost-\neffectiveness  threshold  to  ensure  that NHS  resources  are  spent  only  on  health  \ntechnologies  that  increase  the overall health-related quality of life of patients (see \nNICE 2007).  \nWhat do CBAs of Imprisonment Tell Us?  \nThe economics literature includes two approaches to measuring the costs and \nbenefits of sentencing options. Primary studies of the type reviewed in McDougall  et  \nal.  (2003)  are  based  on  the  collection  of  primary  data.  A second   approach   is   \nto   review   existing   effects   studies   and   then   build economic models based in \npart on data from such a review. \n5 \n \n McDougall   et   al.   (2003) reviewed studies of the cost-benefits of sentencing \noptions. They carried out structured searches of studies carried out  between  1980  \nand  2001  using  nine  electronic  databases,  as  well  as consulting  experts  in  the  \nfield.  The search identified  only  two  CBAs  of imprisonment, both undertaken in \nthe USA. In the first of these, Gray and Olson (1989) assessed the cost-benefit of \nprison for burglars, and included the rehabilitation  and  specific  deterrence  effect  \nof  prison  in  the  analysis. The  study  found  that  every  one  dollar  spent  on  \nprison  produced  only $0.24  of  avoided  offending.  In  contrast,  for  burglars  \ngiven  a  probation sentence,  every  dollar  spent  on  the  sentence  produced  \n$1.70  of  avoided offending. While this result would suggest that probation is \npreferable to prison   as   a   sentence   for   burglars,   there   are   caveats   to   \ndrawing   this conclusion.   First,   a   before\/after   study   was   employed   to   \nmeasure   the changes  in  offending  resulting  from  the  sentences,  meaning  that  \nany variation  in  effect  may  be  due  to  differences  in  the  characteristics  of  the \noffenders   receiving   the   interventions.   Second,   the   economic   analysis \nundertaken   was   judged   by   McDougall   and   colleagues   to   have   been \nincomplete,  as  it  did  not  attempt  to  capture  the  intangible  victim  costs  of pain \nand suffering.  \nThe  second  CBA  study  identified  by  McDougall  et  al.,  conducted  by Piehl  and  \nDiIulio  (1995),  assessed  the  cost-benefit  of  prison  for  different types of \noffenders compared with doing nothing, but considered only the incapacitation   \neffect   of   prison.   They   found   that,   for   offenders   who committed twelve \ncrimes or more a year, every one dollar spent on prison produced  $2.80  of  avoided  \noffending.  However, for  all  offenders  the benefit  reduced  to  $0.36.  This  would  \nsuggest  that  prison  is  an  efficient sentencing  option  for  only  the  more  serious  \noffenders.  Piehl  and  Dilulio concluded  that  prison  pays  for  most  state  prisoners  \nwho  comprise  either violent  or   repeat  offenders  and\/or  who  present  a  real  \ndanger  to  the physical  safety  or  property  of  their  community.  However, for \noffenders committing auto thefts at a rate of three a year, burglaries at a rate of six a \nyear,   and   petty   thefts   at   a   rate   of   24   a   year,   costs   of   imprisonment \noutweighed the social benefits of imprisonment. This was particularly true of those \nconvicted of drug offences. Once again, this conclusion is subject to caveats. While \nthe economic analysis was judged by McDougall et al. (2003) to  have  been  \ncomplete,  and  the  authors  did  attempt  to  measure  the intangible   costs    of   \npain   and   suffering,    the   analysis    captured   only incapacitation  effects.  \nFurthermore,  changes  in  offending  were  assessed by  assuming  that  pre-\nrelease  rates  of  self-reported  offending  would  have been maintained had the \noffender not been incarcerated. This approach is not   generally   considered   \nreliable   as   it   relies   on   the   assumption   that offenders  would  continue  to  \noffend  at  the  same  rate  if  they  were  not incarcerated.  This ignores 'maturation, \nspontaneous remission or  regression to the mean'  1 (Hedderman and Hough 2005, \np.60).  \n6 \n \nA key limitation with  the CBAs identified by McDougall et  al. (2003)  is that the \nfollow-up periods for measuring recidivism were relatively short. In response to these \nlimitations and others, two recent studies have used a different approach to estimate \nthe efficiency of prisons - building economic models onto reviews of effect studies.  \nAos et al. (2001) and Aos, Miller and Drake (2006) were  commissioned by the \nWashington State  Legislature to investigate  the  cost-effectiveness  of  different  \nsentencing  options.  They conducted a review of research to identify what works to \nreduce crime. The estimates of short-term changes in offending rates identified in \nthis review were then extrapolated over time using data on the relationship between \nage and crime. These long-term changes in offending were then valued, taking  \naccount  of  both  the  cost  to  the  public  sector  and  to  victims.  These estimates  \nof  the  value  of  sentencing  options  were  then  compared  to  the costs  of  the  \nsentencing  options  to  determine  whether  they  represented efficient use of public \nmoney.  \nOne of the interventions considered by Aos et al. (2001) and Aos, Miller and Drake \n(2006) is prison. Evidence from six methodologically rigorous effectiveness studies \nsuggested that, following intensive probation, juvenile offenders commit as many \ncrimes as if they had received a custodial sentence. However, as intensive probation \ncosts on average $18,854 less than incarceration, it was concluded the probation \nwas a more efficient use of public resources.  Similarly, evidence from  three well-\ndesigned and conducted studies of effectiveness for adult offenders found that adults \ncommit as many crimes after intensive supervision as they would after receiving a \ncustodial sentence. However, as intensive supervision costs on average $5,925 less \nthan incarceration, it was concluded that supervision is a more efficient use of public \nresources. A similar method was adopted by Marsh and Fox (2008), but to estimate \nthe  costs  and  benefits  of  prison  in  England  and  Wales.  The model estimated \nthe net benefit of non-custodial sentences for adult and juvenile offenders when \ncompared with custodial sentences, and captured the incapacitation, rehabilitation, \nand specific deterrence effects. For those sentences for which statistically significant \ndifferences in post-sentence offending were identified, non-custodial sentences were \nfound to produce a net  benefit  when  compared  with  custodial  sentences.  \nSpecifically, residential drug treatment, surveillance (for example, electronic \nmonitoring), and surveillance combined with drug treatment were found to both cost \nless and to reduce offending when compared with prison.  \nMarsh and Fox (2008) identified some caveats that must be borne in mind when \napplying their results to inform policy making. First, while the study attempted to \nfocus on UK-based data, the majority of evidence of effect came from studies \nundertaken in the USA, calling into question the transferability of the results to the \nUK. Second, there was a limited number of studies that assessed the relative \neffectiveness of custodial and noncustodial sentences and that met the tight \nmethodological criteria used during the literature review. Third, there was \nheterogeneity in the effects identified in these studies.  \n7 \n \n \nTo summarise, the existing CBAs suggest that prison is an inefficient sentencing \noption. However, where the analysis differentiates between offender types, it \nsuggests that prison may be efficient for more serious offenders.  \nDeterrence  \nOne of the gaps in the CBA summarised in the previous section is that it does not \ncapture the general deterrent effect of imprisonment. Economists consider \ndeterrence using both theoretical models and empirical (mainly econometric) \nevidence.  \nEconomic Models of Deterrence  \nWhy do people commit crime? Why do they commit particular crimes? Can we \nexplain the amount of crime that is committed? Traditionally the domain of \ncriminologists, these questions have increasingly caught the attention of economists. \nIn 1968, as part of a larger model designed to explore optimal  criminal  justice  \npolicy,  Becker  (1968)  developed  the 'supply of offense' function. He argued that \nthose who offend, just like anyone else, are rational agents trying to maximise their \nexpected utility. That is, an individual will commit an offence if the expected utility of \ndoing so is positive, and will not if it is negative. Whether the utility of doing so is \npositive or negative depends on the relative size of the benefits of committing a \ncrime (the expected income it generates) and the cost of committing a crime (the \nexpected punishment). \n Eide (1999) outlines the development of this basic model since it was first proposed \nby Becker and the implications of these developments for our understanding of the \nmagnitude of the deterrence effect. The simplest version of the model identified by \nEide views the choice to undertake legal or illegal activities from the perspective of \n'portfolio choice' models. Here individuals are seen as choosing to invest their time \nbetween activities with different risks and rewards. Illegal activities are considered \nrisky because of the uncertainty about sanctions. Within this model, the direction and \nmagnitude of the deterrence effect depends on the attitude of individuals towards \nrisk. If individuals are risk averse, then increases in either the probability or severity \nof punishment will deter crime.  However, if individuals are risk-loving, then the effect \nof an increase in the severity of a sanction is uncertain. An increase in severity will \nreduce the expected gains from crime, which will produce two effects: a substitution \naway from crime to legal activities that are now relatively more lucrative; and an \nincrease in criminal activity to maintain 'income' levels now that returns are lower. \nThe overall effect on crime is indeterminate.  \nA different type of model perceives the choice to commit a crime as the allocation of \ntime, rather than money or wealth, between legal and illegal activities. Within these \nmodels individuals choose to either specialise in legal or illegal activities or \n8 \n \nundertake a mix of the two. The allocation of time between activity types will depend \non the monetary and monetised benefits and costs of activities, and an increase in \nthe probability or severity of sanctions will affect the optimal mix of activities. The \neffect of increases in the probability or severity of punishment depends on whether \nleisure time is assumed to be fixed or not fixed. Assuming that leisure time is not \nfixed, the same results as for the portfolio choice model are obtained. However, \nassuming that leisure time is fixed causes the effect of changes in the severity of \nsanctions to become inconclusive.   \nUnderlying all of these models is a variation of rational choice theory.2 One  critique  \nof  the rational  choice  model  is  that  it is  an  inadequate explanation of behaviour \nas people have insufficient information about the environment and the outcomes of \nactions to make genuinely rational decisions. This criticism has caused economists \nto suggest that the theory of bounded rationality may be a better representation of \noffenders' behaviour than the rational choice theory (see Nagin and Paternoster \n1993).  \nOther critiques of rational choice theory range from outright rejection in favour of \nnormative explanations of behaviour  to suggestions that rational  choice  theory  is  \ninadequate  because  people's  behaviour  is determined  by  procedural  rationality  \n-  where  people  follow  rules established by history or social relations - or by \nexpressive rationality - where people demonstrate their self-conception and worth by \nparticipating in symbolic acts (Eide 1999). So, for example, it has been argued that \nrational  choice  theory  is  better  at  explaining  offences  which  can  be monetised \nthan expressive offences such as domestic violence (Trasler 1993).  Some  \nvariations  of  the  model  have  relaxed  the  monetising assumption.  However, \nthese models  produce  more  ambiguous  results regarding the impact of \npunishment on criminal activity.  \n \nThis is not the place to resolve this debate. However, it is important to elaborate \nwhat is entailed by applying the theory of rational choice to criminal behaviour. As \nBecker (1968) himself put it:  \n. . . a useful theory of criminal behavior can dispense with special theories of \nanomie, psychological inadequacies, or inheritance of special traits and \nsimply extend the economist's usual analysis of choice. (p.170)  \nIt is perhaps this dismissal of the importance of social norms and hence political and \nmoral dimensions that characterises the distinction between economic and \ncriminological theories. Eide (1999) describes economic theories  as  assuming  \npreferences  to  be  constant,  and  individuals  as choosing between courses of \naction to best satisfy these preferences, given the incentives offered by the \nenvironment. Within these theories, there is no discussion of the role of norms in \ndecision making. In criminological theories, in contrast, the normative environment is \n9 \n \none of the factors which shapes people's preferences. Thus, while economic theory \nconceives of the deterrence effect in a narrow sense - the effect of law enforcement \non the outcomes of actions - the deterrence effect can be seen from a broader \nperspective as comprising any factors which exert a preventative force against \ncrime, either by influencing the gains associated with crime or by influencing norms.  \nIn summary, the impact of an increase in the probability of a sanction on the supply \nof crime is dependent upon the assumptions employed by the models, though \nreasonable assumptions suggest that an increase in the probability of a sanction will \nreduce the supply of crime. However, the impact of increases in the severity of \nsanctions on the supply of crime is less clear-cut. Depending on individuals' attitude \ntowards risk, and whether the model employed allows all the costs and benefits of \nlegal and illegal activities to be monetised, an increase in the severity of a sanction \ncould produce either an increase or a decrease in the supply of crime.  \nThe implication of the theoretical models developed by economists is that accepting \nor rejecting the hypothesis that the prospect of imprisonment has a deterrent effect \ndepends on assumptions about the nature of individuals' attitude towards risk. If it is \naccepted that individuals are risk averse and also that all social and psychological \neffects can be monetised, then crime is deterred by increases in the probability and \n(less certainly) by the severity of punishment. However, if either of these starting \npoints is rejected, then the deterrence effect of prison or any other sanction is \nindeterminate.  \nEmpirical Studies of Deterrence  \nIn their examination of deterrence, economists have not relied entirely on theoretical \nmodels. Attempts to empirically estimate the deterrent effect of  the  probability  and  \nseverity  of  punishment  tend  to  support  the conclusions  of  the  theoretical  \nmodels  outlined  above.  While most economists and criminologists would probably \nagree that the empirical evidence supports the conclusion that an increase in the \nprobability of sanction will lead to a decrease in crime, the evidence on sentence \nseverity is more equivocal.  \nFor example, Von Hirsch et al.'s (1999) survey of the literature on 'marginal \ndeterrence' is equivocal about the deterrence effect of increasing the severity of \npunishment. Marginal deterrence is the effect of making changes to the certainty or \nseverity of punishment. The evidence suggests that,  while  there  may  be  some  \nadditional  incapacitative  or  marginal deterrence effect from increasing the use of \nimprisonment, increasing the actual and perceived risk of being caught is a more \neffective, and more cost-effective, way of securing crime reduction (Von Hirsch et al. \n1999). They conclude that 'the studies reviewed do not provide a basis for inferring \nthat increasing the severity of sentences generally is capable of enhancing deterrent \neffects' (p.1).  \n10 \n \nEide (1999) interprets the empirical literature as corresponding with the theoretical \nliterature outlined in the previous section. That is, the variation in the relationship \nbetween severity of punishment and offending identified in the empirical literature \ncan be explained by variations in the proportion of risk-lovers in the population. Eide \n(1999) summarises the empirical literature and concludes that: 'in some studies the \neffect of an increase in the severity of punishment is not statistically different from \nzero, and a statistically significant positive effect has also occasionally been \nobtained' (p.360).  \nHowever, a counter view on the divergence in findings is that they are the result of a \nfailure in research design in that the theoretical model being tested is not always \nproperly operationalised. Mendes and MacDonald (2001) challenge Von Hirsch et \nal.'s findings and argue that they are 'a consequence of theoretical slippage when \nmoving from a verbal theoretical statement to the statistical representation of that \nstatement' (p.589). In essence they argue that deterrence is a theory in which the \ncomponent parts (certainty of punishment and severity of punishment) are inter-\nrelated and inter-dependent. They contend that this is how the theory of deterrence \nwas conceptualised by Becker (1968) but not all subsequent research has followed \nthis approach.  \nMendes's and MacDonald's (2001) review of existing empirical studies of deterrence \nconcluded that: 'published empirical studies that fail to find a significant impact of the \nseverity of punishment do not effectively translate the theory' (p.606). Further, when \nthe theory is effectively translated as a 'package' composed of three elements: \narrest, conviction and punishment, then the severity of punishment does represent \nan important role in implementing that package.  \nEven if we accept Mendes's and MacDonald's (2001) argument that a lot of empirical \nanalysis of deterrence effects have used mis-specified models there remains some \nambiguity about the relationship between sentence severity and crime rates. In their \nreview Mendes and MacDonald found 16 studies that identified an effect of severity \nof punishment on offending and seven studies that did not.  \nIn summary, the findings of the empirical literature on the deterrence effect mirrors \nthat of the theoretical literature in that it supports the existence of a relationship \nbetween the probability of punishment and offending rates, but suggests an \nambiguity about the impact of sentence severity on crime.  \nRetribution?  \nOf the different effects of prison outlined in the introductory section, CBA measures \nthe incapacitation, rehabilitation, and specific deterrence effects, and economic \ntheory and econometric analytical techniques have been applied to understand the \ngeneral deterrence effect. There is very limited economic evidence on the remaining \neffect, retribution. The authors are aware of only one economic study that addresses \nthis question. This study, by Nagin et al. (2006), elicited people's willingness to pay \n11 \n \nfor two alternative policy  interventions  for  drug-using  offenders:  adding  a  \nrehabilitative component (drug treatment) to a one-year prison sentence; and \nincreasing the period of incarceration from one year to two years.  \nRespondents in Pennsylvania were randomly assigned to give their willingness to \npay for one of the interventions. Other than the differences in the length of sentence \nand the availability of treatment, the description of the interventions was identical.  \nFor instance, in each case it was explained to respondents that the effect of the \nintervention would be to reduce youth crime by 30% and that youths in the \nprogrammes are also more likely to graduate from school and get jobs.  \nBased on approximately 4.8 million Pennsylvanian households, the authors \nestimated total willingness to pay to be between $387 million and $468 million for a \n30% reduction in youth crime. Although Nagin and his colleagues did not translate \nthe public's willingness to pay into a cost per crime, Cohen (forthcoming) \nsubsequently attempted this calculation. He estimated a willingness-to-pay value for \none avoided serious crime of $100,000 in the case of the extended period of \nincarceration and $125,000 in the case of the rehabilitative intervention.  \nGiven that the interventions were presented as having the same crime-control \nbenefit (that is, the interventions have the same incapacitation, rehabilitation, and \ndeterrence effect), this experiment might be interpreted as estimating the value that \nthe public (at least in Pennsylvania) places on the retributive effect of incarceration. \nMore precisely, the fact that respondents were willing to pay more for the less \nretributive intervention would suggest that retribution is not valued as highly when set \nagainst the other aims of sentencing.  \nHowever, Cohen (forthcoming) points to a number of caveats to drawing this \nconclusion. For instance, while the two interventions were presented as being the \nsame in their crime-control benefits and their impacts on future educational \nattainment and employment rates, it might be  possible  that  the  responses  elicited  \nare  still  picking  up  people's expectations  that  rehabilitative  interventions  \nproduce better  outcomes than incarceration. It is also important to recognise that \nthere are various biases inherent in willingness-to-pay studies that may undermine \nthis result. In particular, participants may respond differently to the hypothetical \nscenarios proposed in the studies from how they would respond if faced with the \nsame problem in real life. Further detail of the challenges associated with such \nstudies is available in Carson (2007).  \n \nDiscussion  \nRecent increases in the prison population in the UK and the resulting prison  \novercrowding  has  given  renewed  vigour  to  the  debate  about whether \nincarceration is an appropriate response to offending. An important part of this \n12 \n \ndebate is whether prison represents an efficient use of public resources. In order to \nanswer this question, the article summarises the economic evidence on the costs \nand benefits of prison.  \nSeveral examples of the CBA of prison are identified in the literature. These suggest \nthat prison is an inefficient sentencing option, but where the analysis differentiates \nbetween offender types it suggests that prison may be efficient for more serious \noffenders. However, a key limitation to this analysis is that it is able to capture only \ncertain of the effects of prison. Specifically,  it  captures  the  incapacitation,  \nrehabilitation  and  specific deterrence  effects  of  prison,  but  is  unable  to  capture  \nthe  general deterrence and retribution effects. Given that this analysis suggests that \nprison is generally an inefficient use of resources when these effects are not \nconsidered  the question  becomes  whether  there  is  evidence  for  the general \ndeterrence and retribution effects of prison, and, if so, whether these effects are \nlarge enough that the use of prison becomes an efficient use of resources. \n Economists have built theoretical models and undertaken econometric analysis to \ndetermine whether the probability and severity of punishment impacts on the \nlikelihood of offending. Both of these bodies of work suggest that an increase in the \nprobability of punishment has a reductive effect on offending rates, but that there is \nan ambiguous relationship between the severity of punishment and offending. The \ntheoretical models developed by economists suggest that whether severity of \npunishment impacts on offending is dependent upon the individuals' attitudes \ntowards risk. If it is accepted that individuals are risk averse and also that all social \nand psychological effects can be monetised, then crime is deterred by increases in \nthe probability and severity of punishment. However, if either of these starting points \nis rejected, then the deterrence effect of the severity of sanction  is  indeterminate.  \nGiven  that  the  decision  to  incarcerate offenders is related to the severity of \npunishment, the literature would suggest that the deterrence effect of prison is \nequivocal and depends on the degree to which the relevant population is risk averse.  \nThe review identified only one economic study that relates to the final effect of \nprison: retribution. While this suggests that the public does not place much value on \nthe retributive effect of incarcerating offenders, there were limits to the conclusions \nthat could be drawn about the existence or magnitude of the retributive effect.  \nThis article also points to some important gaps in the economic evidence that need \nfilling to appropriately inform decisions on sentencing policy. First, more CBA is \nrequired to determine the relative efficiency of types and  lengths  of  sentence  for  \ndifferent  offenders  in  the  UK.  Second, econometric analysis is required to \ndetermine whether prison is likely to have a general deterrent effect in the UK. Third, \nvery little is known about the retributive effect of prison. Despite these reservations \nabout the state of the evidence, it is reasonable to conclude from the existing cost-\nbenefit evidence that while prison may be an efficient sentencing option for more \nserious offenders, for non-serious offenders the cost outweighs the benefit of the \n13 \n \nincapacitation, rehabilitation and specific deterrence effects. While the evidence on \ngeneral deterrent and retributive effects is limited, the evidence that is available \nconcurs with this assessment. Whatever the other reasons put forward for or against \nthe use of prison, it is reasonable to conclude that using it for anyone but those \nconvicted of serious offences is a waste of public resources.  \n \nNotes  \n \n1 Hedderman and Hough (2005) explain, regression to the mean involves extreme \nscores in the first observation shifting towards the mean on subsequent \nobservations.  \n2 See, for example, Hopkins Burke (2005) for an overview of the history of rational \nchoice theory within criminology.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \nReferences  \n \nAos, S., Phipps, P., Barnoski, R. and Lieb, R.
