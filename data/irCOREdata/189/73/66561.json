Introduction\n[2] It has been understood for over a century that the\nbasic flow structure in a river bend is a helix. Faster near-\nsurface flow moves toward the outer bank because the\ncentrifugal acceleration acting on it exceeds the centripetal\nacceleration due to superelevation. The opposite is true for\nthe slower-moving near-bed flow which therefore moves\ntoward the inner bank. In laboratory bends of moderate\ncurvature and symmetric cross section the helix occupies\nthe full width. In natural bends it may be restricted to the\nouter part of the channel if a shallowly submerged point bar\nsteers the inner-bank flow entirely outward [e.g., Dietrich\nand Smith, 1983; Van Alphen et al., 1984; Thorne and Rais,\n1985].\n[3] In sharply curved bends another major flow structure\nis often present: a recirculation eddy generated by flow\nseparation at the inner or outer bank. In this paper we\ninvestigate recirculation generated by high curvature of the\ninner bank, producing a \u2018\u2018dead zone\u2019\u2019 of weak reverse flow\nimmediately past the apex [e.g., Rozovskii, 1957; Leopold et\nal., 1960]. Small recirculation eddies at the inner bank may\nalso exist in the lee of emergent or shallowly submerged\npoint bars [e.g., Frothingham and Rhoads, 2003]; they\nprobably share some of the same features but are not the\nfocus of this paper. However it is generated, flow separation\nalters the locations of strongest and weakest flow and thus\nhas important implications for sedimentation and meander\nmigration. The existence of a recirculation eddy or \u2018\u2018dead\nzone\u2019\u2019 also creates a distinctive ecological niche and is\nlikely to reduce flow mixing and pollutant dispersal. Yet\nvery little is known about the detailed flow structure in bend\nrecirculation eddies, how it links with the main downstream\nflow, or to what extent the latter retains the normal helical\nmotion. Hodskinson and Ferguson [1998] simulated a field\nexample fairly successfully using a three-dimensional (3-D)\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, but neither they\nnor previous researchers described the flow structure in any\ndetail.\n[4] We have investigated flow separation along the inner\nbanks of two sharp meander bends using a combination of\nfieldwork and modeling. Field measurements of velocity\nand turbulence were used to set up and test 3-D CFD\nsimulations. Flow structures were then identified and\ndescribed using the model output which, to the extent it is\ncredible, is spatially much richer than field measurements\ncan hope to be. In this paper we discuss technical issues in\nsetting up CFD models of natural river bends with recircu-\nlation, validate the model on field measurements in one\nbend with a small recirculation eddy, then use it to inves-\ntigate the detailed flow structure in this bend and another\nwith a much bigger recirculation. The specific questions we\nseek to answer are: Can generic flow structures be identified\nin the two bends? Are there differences between the two\nbends, and if so what local factors appear responsible for\nthem? What are the main differences between bends with\nand without separation? And how is the flow in an inner-\n1Now at Department of Earth Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.\nCopyright 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0043-1397\/03\/2003WR001965$09.00\nESG 2 - 1\nWATER RESOURCES RESEARCH, VOL. 39, NO. 11, 1322, doi:10.1029\/2003WR001965, 2003\nbank recirculation zone linked with the downstream flow\nalong the outer bank? The flow structure in a bend with\nrecirculation at the outer bank will be addressed elsewhere,\nas will the dependence of recirculation in bends on dis-\ncharge level.\n2. Study Site and Field Measurements\n2.1. Study Site\n[5] The bends studied in this paper are close together on\nthe River Dean, which flows across the glacial sediments of\nthe Cheshire Plain just south of Manchester in northern\nEngland (Figure 1). The Dean is actively meandering with\nwell-developed pool-riffle morphology. Its bed and banks\nconsist mainly of gravel but with sand on sheltered parts of\npoint bars and in recirculation zones, and a drape of silty\nsand on the bank tops. It has an active floodplain that is\nslightly incised into the main glacial plain, so that the\nchannel is locally confined by low (1\u20133 m) terraces that\nrestrict an otherwise freely meandering habit. The selected\nbends are not affected by tree roots or large woody debris,\nthough others are. The hydrological regime is fairly flashy\nwith flood events generated mainly by autumn and winter\nfrontal rainfall but also summer convective storms. Bank-\nfull discharge in the study reach is 2\u20133 m3s\u00011; bank-full\nwidth is typically 4\u20135 m but varies between 3 and 10 m.\n[6] In order to assess the frequency of flow separation,\nthe second author inspected all bends in accessible reaches\nof the stream from where it leaves the hills to where it\njoins the larger River Bollin. Flow separation at one or\nboth banks was observed in nearly half of the 411 bends\nidentified, with inner-bank recirculation extending at least\na quarter of the way across the channel in 9% of all bends\nand halfway across the channel in 2% [Parsons, 2003].\nInspection of larger streams in the area showed a similarly\nhigh frequency, and we understand separation is\nalso common in lowland streams in the United States\n[Frothingham and Rhoads, 2003; B. Rhoads, personal\ncommunication, August 2001]. Two representative bends\nwith inner-bank separation were selected for modeling.\nBend 17 has a small recirculation eddy. Bend 37, previously\nstudied by Hodskinson and Ferguson [1998], has an\nunusually large recirculation eddy extending most of the\nway to the outer bank. The positions of the bends within the\nmeander train are shown in Figure 1.\n2.2. Topographic and Flow Measurements\n[7] Measurements in bend 37 were made in August 1995\nat a time of fairly low and almost steady discharge. The field\nmethods are described by Hodskinson and Ferguson [1998].\nIn brief, the topography was quantified by surveying 12 cross\nsections, more closely spaced in the sharpest part of the bend.\nStreamwise and lateral velocity components were measured\nat the inflow and selected other sections using an electro-\nmagnetic current meter, and a bed-surface grain size distri-\nbution was measured by pebble count near the inflow. The\ntopographic, roughness, and inflow data are used below to set\nup a new CFD model. The within-bend velocity measure-\nments are used to delimit the recirculation as a test of the\nmodel, but no further validation is attempted because these\nvelocity data are only 2-D and of coarser spatial and temporal\nresolution than we subsequently obtained in bend 17.\n[8] Bend 17 was investigated in July 2000, again at fairly\nlow and almost steady discharge. Its topography was\nsurveyed by total station using breaks of slope to define\nprimary features and spot heights to add detail (404 points\nin all). These data were used to construct a digital elevation\nmodel (DEM). The water surface elevation at many points\nwithin the submerged area was obtained by recording the\nvertical angle to the intersection of the reflector rod with the\nwater surface. The surface extent of the recirculation eddy\nwas also mapped. Size counts of 100 surface pebbles\nwere made in 1-m2 quadrats at several locations in the bend\nto help specify bed roughness. Velocity measurements were\nmade to obtain inflow boundary conditions and spatially\ndistributed validation data. The measurements were made\nusing a SontekTM acoustic Doppler velocity meter (ADV)\nmounted on a specially made wading rod. This had an\nattached spirit bubble to ensure the rod was vertical, and a\npair of reflectors on a crossbar which were surveyed from\nthe total station to fix the location and orientation of the\nADV probe in the same coordinate system as the DEM and\nCFD model (see Lane et al. [1998] for details). The ADV\nmeasures three orthogonal components of velocity at 25 Hz\nin a sensing volume of <1 cm3 about 5 cm below the probe.\nInflow measurements were made for 120 s at each of several\nheights every 0.25 m across the channel. These data were\nused to calculate stream discharge and interpolate the inflow\nvelocity distribution as a boundary condition for the CFD\nmodel. Test data were collected by fixing the ADV at one\nheight and recording for 60 s at each of a number of\nlocations 1\u20132 m apart throughout the bend, then doing\nthe same with the ADV set at a second height. This\nprocedure does not generate vertical or lateral velocity\nprofiles of the kind commonly used to test simulations of\nlaboratory flows, but for our field sites and equipment it was\nquicker than profiling and thus allowed the collection of\nmore data before there was a significant change in water\nstage (which fell by only 4 mm during the flow measure-\nment period). It also meant that test data were obtained\nFigure 1. Location of study reach and of modeled bends\nwithin it.\nESG 2 - 2 FERGUSON ET AL.: INNER-BANK RECIRCULATION IN MEANDERS\nthroughout the bend, and at a range of relative heights\nwithin the flow, rather than being concentrated in certain\nlocations. The signal-to-noise ratio and correlation coeffi-\ncient were used to check the quality of the velocity measure-\nments. Mean velocities were computed and the series were\nsubject to a low-pass Gaussian filter [Lane et al., 1998]\nbefore turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) was calculated.\n2.3. Bend Morphology\n[9] Bend 17 (Figure 2a) is a fairly sharp bend which turns\n80\u0001 to the right over a centerline distance of 10 m. The\nchannel has a bank-full width of 5\u20136 m so the mean ratio of\nradius of curvature (R) to width (W ) is about 1.4. Total relief\nfrom the left-bank floodplain to the deepest part of the pool\n(near the centerline and past the apex) is 1.4 m. The left,\nouter bank is 0.9 m high and eroding over its full length. The\nright, inner bank is less steep and is vegetated down to the\nlow-flow waterline. Neither bank is uniformly curved in\nplan. The inner bank follows the common pattern of being\nsharpest at the apex, and the outer bank has a slight reverse\ncurve opposite the apex separating two zones of fairly high\ncurvature. This irregularity in outer-bank curvature does not\nappear to be due to any variation in bank materials, so\nprobably reflects the location and size of cantilever failures\nof the more cohesive upper bank as the basal gravel is eroded\nduring floods. Remains of collapsed blocks are responsible\nfor local irregularities in the bed topography near the left\nbank downstream from the pool. Flow enters over a gravel\nriffle. This is highest in midstream so there are two talwegs,\nthat on the left being deeper. The mean flow depth varied\nconsiderably around the bend, from a maximum of 0.34 m at\nthe inflow to 0.76 m in the pool and 0.51 m at outflow from\nthe bend. The central and outer parts of the bed are gravel\nthroughout, with D84 ranging from 69 mm on the riffle to\n54 mm in the pool, but most of the small point bar at and\nbeyond the apex of the inner bank is sand.\n[10] Bend 37 is a sharp right-hand bend with a deep pool\ntoward the outer bank and a small submerged point bar\n(Figure 2b). It follows a long, almost straight, riffle and\nleads immediately into a left-hand bend. The pool and its\neroding outer bank consist of gravel but the point bar is\nsand-covered. The inner bank is grassed down to the normal\nwaterline. The outer bank is capped by overbank fines with\na grass root layer. When surveyed in 1995 bend 37 turned\n130\u0001 to the right over a distance of 15 m along the outer\nbank and 7 m along the inner bank. These figures together\nwith the mean channel width of 5.5 m give mean R\/W ratios\nof 1.2 and 0.6 at the outer and inner banks. At the time the\nfieldwork was done the high curvature led to inner-bank\nseparation which extended most of the way to the outer\nbank. By 2001 the outer bank had retreated substantially,\nincreasing the radius of curvature, and the separation zone\nwas less extensive. The upstream riffle and outer parts of the\nbed are gravel throughout, with a D84 of 66 mm, but most of\nthe bed within the separation zone is sand.\n3. Flow Modeling and Validation\n[11] The CFD modeling was based on version 3.4 of the\nPHOENICSTM code, which solves the full 3-D Navier-\nStokes equations discretized over a finite-volume grid.\nFollowing Lane et al. [1999], we used a hybrid-upwind\nnumerical interpolation scheme which takes central differ-\nences between cells where diffusion dominates but upwind\ndifferences where convection is high (Peclet number >2).\nThis is strictly only first-order accurate, but it is more stable\nthan higher-order schemes which can introduce spurious\noscillations into solutions. The hybrid scheme should give\nbetter interpolation within recirculations and dead zones\nwhile retaining second-order accuracy and low numerical\ndiffusivity in the parts of the domain with fast downstream\nflow. Our spatially distributed validation data allow us to\ncheck the accuracy of the scheme in both situations. As\nsolution accuracy controls sensitivity to grid design, we\nFigure 2. Topography of the two study bends as\ndetermined by field survey and kriging, and cross sections\nused to interpolate boundary-fitted CFD grids. Cartesian\ncoordinate system for Figure 3 and Tables 1 and 2 has x\npositive rightward along first cross section.\nFERGUSON ET AL.: INNER-BANK RECIRCULATION IN MEANDERS ESG 2 - 3\nundertook a rigorous grid independence test (see below).\nThe pressure and momentum equations are coupled though\nthe SIMPLEST algorithm [Pantankar and Spalding, 1972].\nThe solution was deemed to have converged when mass and\nmomentum flux residuals were less than 0.1% of the inlet\nflux and spot values in a critical part of the domain were\nchanging by less than 0.01%.\n[12] Direct solution of the Reynolds stress terms in the\nNavier-Stokes equations cannot be accomplished for natural\nchannel flows with currently available computer power.\nHere we use Reynolds averaging, and specifically the\ntwo-equation k-e model modified by renormalization group\ntheory [Yakhot and Orszag, 1986]. This allows greater\ndissipation in areas of high strain (as found in shear layers\nand separation zones), and tends to predict reattachment\npoints better [Yakhot et al., 1992; Lien and Leschziner,\n1994]. It was independently chosen for all three of the\npioneering applications of 3-D CFD to natural channels\nwith complex geometry [Hodskinson and Ferguson, 1998;\nLane et al., 1999; Nicholas and Smith, 1999].\n3.1. Computational Grid\n[13] A boundary-fitted curvilinear computational grid\nwas fitted to the irregular bend topography by specifying\na series of cross-section planes, then interpolating more\nplanes to define a grid with specified numbers of cells in the\nstreamwise, transverse and vertical directions. The surveyed\ncross sections were used for bend 37. For bend 17 we\nextracted a series of 17 cross sections from the DEM,\nwhich gave greater freedom in the position of each cross\nsection. The sections used for grid construction are shown in\nFigure 2a. Rapid changes in cell aspect ratio or orientation\nwere avoided in the interests of numerical stability.\n[14] The bend 17 model had 96 cells longitudinally,\n42 across, and 10 vertically. Cells in the vertical were set\nso as to satisfy the dimensionless wall height (z+) criterion:\n30 < z\u00fe < 300 \u00f01\u00de\nwhere\nz\u00fe \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ntb=r\np\nu\nzb \u00f02\u00de\nand tb is the bed shear stress, u the kinematic viscosity, and\nzb the distance between the center of the grid cell next to the\nwall and the wall itself. With this criterion, and the domain\nextent, this implies average cell dimensions of about 12 \u0006\n12 \u0006 6 cm at the outer bank. Mean cell length decreases\nacross the channel to \u00076 cm at the inner bank, and cell\nheight varies between \u00071 and \u00079 cm according to local\nflow depth. From (2), reducing the thickness of the near\nwall cell further, by increasing the number of cells in the\nvertical, increases the possibility that the dimensionless wall\nheight criterion is not met in areas of shallower flow. This\nlimits the number of cells in the vertical. Two slight changes\nto the geometry of the inner bank had to be made before\nconverged solutions could be obtained: rounding off the\napex by 10 cm to avoid excessive change in direction at the\napex section, and making the sloping grassy bank beyond\nthe apex vertical for at least 5 cm at the waterline to avoid\nvanishing cell heights.\n[15] The bend 37 model had 80 \u0006 30 \u0006 10 cells, with\nmean dimensions of \u000728 \u0006 18 \u0006 5 cm at the outer bank.\n3.2. Boundary Conditions\n[16] The necessary boundary conditions relate to inflow,\noutflow, wall treatment, and water surface. Distributions of\nvelocity across the inflow plane were interpolated from the\nfield measurements described above, using linear interpola-\ntion laterally and the law of the wall vertically. Bend 17\nimmediately follows another bend, so the model domain\nbegins at the start of the bend and TKE at the inlet had to be\nmeasured. Bend 37 is preceded by a straight reach, so we\ncould define an inlet well upstream of the sharp part of the\nbend, set inflow TKE to a nominal value, and allow the\ncomputed flow to evolve before the bend. A hydrostatic\npressure distribution was applied to cells at the outlet plane.\nPressure values within the domain are calculated relative to\nthis, so the outlet planes need to be clear of the effects of\nnegative dynamic pressure in areas of reverse flow. This\nwas easy to achieve in bend 17 which is followed by an\nalmost straight reach, but harder in bend 37 which leads\ndirectly into a reverse bend. Bed and bank roughness was\nparameterized using Launder and Spalding\u2019s [1974] non-\nequilibrium version of the law of the wall in the layers of\ncells touching the rough boundaries. Shear further from the\nboundaries is modeled explicitly. A uniform roughness\nheight was adopted, estimated from the riffle bed grain size\ndistribution using ks = 3.5D84. This exaggerates the skin\nroughness of the sandy parts of the bed, but the sand was\nrippled which adds some form resistance that is not repre-\nsented in the model grid geometry. Use of a gravel rough-\nness is appropriate for the cut banks that are gravelly\nthroughout, and is probably reasonable for those banks that\nwere not eroding since they were all vegetated.\n[17] The treatment of the free surface follows Bradbrook\net al. [2000a]. Until recently most numerical models of open\nchannel flow, including Hodskinson and Ferguson\u2019s [1998]\nsimulation of bend 37 using a different CFD code, specified\na rigid lid at the free surface, across which all normal\nresolutes are set to zero. In practice, water surface elevations\nwill deviate from this, especially where there is streamline\ncurvature. The rigid lid treatment deals with the effects of\nthis upon the momentum equations explicitly by introduc-\ning a nonzero pressure term at the surface [e.g., Leschziner\nand Rodi, 1979] to represent the effects of any supereleva-\ntion or depression. It is also necessary to correct the mass\ncontinuity equation to recognize that the vertical extent of\nthe flow domain also varies in the presence of deviation\nfrom the horizontal lid. If this is not done, velocity will be\noverestimated in zones of superelevation and underesti-\nmated in zones of depression. Thus we modified the code\nto correct for mass continuity effects by allowing variable\nporosities in the surface layer of cells (in effect, allowing the\ncell height to vary) so that mass continuity is maintained\nwithout distorting the streamwise velocity.\n3.3. Solution Error, Grid Independence, and Validation\n[18] The uncertainty in simulated flow properties in each\nbend can be estimated using the grid-convergence-index\n(GCI) method based on Richardson extrapolation [Roache,\n1997; Hardy et al., 2003]. We reran both models with the\nnumber of cells in each direction doubled and then halved.\nTable 1 shows the root-mean square differences between\nESG 2 - 4 FERGUSON ET AL.: INNER-BANK RECIRCULATION IN MEANDERS\nsimulated flow properties at common points of the three\ngrids. With one exception (w in bend 17) all velocity\ncomponents in both bends show little difference between\nmedium and fine resolution predictions. This suggests the\noriginal medium-resolution velocity predictions were effec-\ntively grid-independent, and we therefore use them below to\ndescribe and illustrate the flow. However, TKE predictions\n(and those of w in bend 17) differ substantially between\neach grid which suggests the medium-resolution results are\nnot grid-independent for these variables. Approximate 95%\nconfidence intervals for flow properties on the medium grid,\ncalculated by Roache\u2019s method, are mostly around \u00b110%\n(and narrower for u in bend 37), but considerably wider for\nw and k in bend 17.\n[19] To confirm that the medium-resolution models\nreproduce measured flow properties to an acceptable\naccuracy we compared the bend-17 simulations with the\n3-D ADV field measurements described above. The 2-D\nmeasurements in bend 37 were regarded as less reliable for\nthis purpose, though Hodskinson and Ferguson [1998]\nfound reasonable agreement with their fixed-lid CFD\nsimulation of that bend. Recent open-channel applications\nof CFD have mostly relied upon qualitative comparison of\nmodel predictions with field measurements, often in the\nform of observed and predicted velocity profiles [e.g.,\nCzernuszenko and Rylov, 2000; Meselhe and Sotiropolous,\n2000; Sofialidis and Prinos, 2000]. However, Lane\nand Richards [2001] argue that this is not a sufficient test\nof a model as velocity measurements represent a sample of\na much richer flow field and so formal inferential statistical\ntesting of the agreement between predictions and measure-\nments is required. We tested the present models using the\ntime-averaged velocity magnitude at each of the 62 ADV\nmeasurement points in bend 17, and its Cartesian compo-\nnents u, v and w parallel to the survey axes. TKE was also\ncompared, even though this paper is restricted to time-\naveraged flow properties, because its successful prediction\nwould support the choice of turbulence model and because\nof its effects on mean flow estimates in areas of strong\nshear.\n[20] Similar tests in the recent literature on CFD appli-\ncations to open channels have reported r2, the squared\ncorrelation between simulated and measured values of a\nflow property. In applications to smooth-walled flumes r2\nvalues of up to 0.95 for u and 0.75 for w have been achieved\n[Bradbrook et al., 1998], but results for natural rivers show\nweaker agreement between model and measurement: r2\nvalues of 0.50\u20130.89 for velocity magnitude and its hori-\nzontal components, and 0.01\u20130.50 for w [Hodskinson and\nFerguson, 1998; Lane et al., 1999; Nicholas and Smith,\n1999; Bradbrook et al., 2000a; Booker et al., 2001]. We\nobtain stronger agreement (as measured by r2; Table 2) than\nin most of these previous studies, which gives some\nconfidence in the use of the CFD results (rather than direct\nmeasurements) to identify and describe flow structures.\n[21] A high correlation indicates small scatter rather than\nlack of bias, and this must also be checked [e.g., Lane et al.,\n1999]. Thus we also inspected scatterplots of observed\nagainst simulated flow properties (Figure 3) and checked\nwhether regression intercepts and slopes differed signifi-\ncantly from 0 and 1 respectively (Table 2). This test of bias\nis more sensitive for the relationships with high r2 [Lane\nand Richards, 2001]. Error is possible in field measure-\nments as well as CFD predictions so, unlike previous\napplications [e.g., Lane et al., 1999] we fitted both forward\nand backward least squares regressions. The forward regres-\nsions (\u2018\u2018CFD on ADV\u2019\u2019 in Table 2) are represented by the\nflatter of the two trend lines in each part of Figure 3. They\nare appropriate if error is assumed to exist only in the CFD\npredictions. The steeper ADV-on-CFD regressions are\nappropriate if error is entirely in the measurements, so these\nlines provide a limit to the range of possible fits. The results\nshow no statistically significant bias in regression intercepts\n(and by implication no systematic error in mean values of\nsimulated flow properties), nor in the slopes of backward\nregressions. However, the forward regression slopes\nare slightly (but significantly) lower than 1 for velocity\nmagnitude and its horizontal components, and much lower\nfor w and k. This means the CFD model tends to predict\nless spatial variability in flow properties than is present in the\nmeasurements. This is most obvious in thew plot (Figure 3d),\nwhere measurements range \u000750% wider than predictions\neven though the latter have the right sign (i.e., whether\nflow is upwelling or downwelling) at all but a few points.\n[22] Detailed inspection revealed that the main discrep-\nancies in u and v are near the margins of the recirculation\neddy. Figure 4 shows the mapped and simulated surface\nlimits of recirculation in both bends. This reveals that the\nsimulation of bend 17 underestimates the width of the\nproximal part of the recirculation by one cell and its\nupstream extent by two grid cells. None of the velocity\nmeasurements in this bend shows reverse flow (negative\nstreamwise velocity relative to curved grid) where the\nsimulation does not, or vice versa, but the imperfect\nprediction of the extent of recirculation evidently leads to\nerrors in velocity magnitude and direction further out into\nthe channel. The discrepancy is probably due to the need to\nTable 1.

Underes-\ntimation of dead-zone width implies overestimation of the\nwidth over which flow is downstream, and thus a tendency\nto underestimate positive velocities in that part of bend 17.\nThis may explain the small bias apparent in Figures 3a\nand 3b.\n[23] The surface extent of the much bigger recirculation\neddy in bend 37 is predicted extremely well (Figure 4), with\na maximum error of one grid cell. In this bend, 21 velocity\nmeasurements revealed reverse flow and 20 of them are\nwithin the simulated recirculation; two measurements\nwithin the simulated recirculation showed small positive\nstreamwise velocities. This shows excellent agreement in\nFigure 4. Observed and simulated limits of surface\nrecirculation in the two bends.\nFigure 3. (opposite) Validation plots for bend 17.

Small measurement\nerrors in w are possible because of the difficulty of holding\nthe ADV wading rod exactly vertical, but measured values\ngreater than \u00b10.02 m s\u00011 are too big to be explained in this\nway. Errors near the edge of the dead zone could relate to\nmacroturbulent structures in the shear layer, especially in\nview of the short duration (60 s) of each measurement. The\nouter-bank errors are probably due to bed irregularities not\nincluded in the model geometry: large protruding clasts\nwhich had presumably fallen in from the eroding bank, and\nmust have deflected the flow to some extent. The main\ndiscrepancies in the TKE plot relate to drastic under-\nprediction at a handful of points. These could also relate\nto macroturbulence near the shear layer or in the wake of\nlarge clasts on the bed.\n[25] Although the CFD predictions do not always match\nperfectly with the measured velocity and turbulence values\nthe agreement is generally good, and comparable to what\nhas been regarded as acceptable by researchers modeling\nflume data [Bradbrook et al., 1998; Huang et al., 2002]. In\nview of the additional uncertainties of field data collection\nwe therefore regard the model as adequately validated for\nuse in discussing the large-scale flow structures present in\nthe two bends.\n4. Large-Scale Flow Structures\n[26] Previous discussions of flow structures in meander\nbends, and in other channel features such as confluences\nand braids, have mostly been based on detailed field\nmeasurements at a number of cross sections [e.g., Dietrich\nand Smith, 1983; Ashmore et al., 1992; Rhoads and\nKenworthy, 1995]. Patterns of secondary circulation have\ngenerally been inferred from plots of cross-stream velocity,\nthough not without controversy since such patterns can\nappear very different according to the orientation chosen\nto define the local streamwise direction [Lane et al., 2000;\nRhoads and Kenworthy, 1999]. Only very recently have\n3-D velocity measurements been used [e.g., Rhoads and\nSukhodolov, 2001; Frothingham and Rhoads, 2003]. Some\nauthors have also [Ashmore et al., 1992], or instead [Van\nAlphen et al., 1984], mapped the difference in flow direc-\ntion between surface and bed.\n[27] By basing our discussion of flow structures on 3-D\nCFD simulations, validated against field measurements,\nwe have spatially much richer information. Velocities are\nevaluated at >104 points in each bend, instead of \u0007102 in\nstudies based entirely on field or flume measurements. The\nsimulated values are of course liable to quasi-random error\nof the magnitude indicated in the last subsection, and may\nbe systematically biased in certain localities (e.g., where the\nedge of the recirculation is mispredicted by one or two\ncells). Nevertheless, the broad patterns of flow are expected\nto be correct. The spatial richness of the simulations relates\nnot just to the number of points resolved but also their near-\nuniform distribution in three dimensions throughout the\nbend. In contrast, cross-section-based field measurements\nare denser vertically than laterally and even sparser longi-\ntudinally. The high spatial resolution of the CFD models\npermits a wider choice of ways to visualize the results in\norder to identify, then describe and illustrate, flow struc-\ntures. We inspected near-surface and near-bed vector and\nstreamline maps; cross-section vector plots; contour maps of\nthe streamwise (u), lateral (v), and vertical (w) components\nof velocity (defined hereafter relative to the boundary-fitted\ngrid, not the DEM); maps of TKE and deviation from\nhydrostatic pressure; and vorticity plots. For illustrative\npurposes we use uv vector maps to show the spatial patterns\nof velocity magnitude and orientation, and vw vector plots\nto show secondary circulation in the plane of selected\nsections. The uv vector maps differ from the usual scaled-\narrow plot in that we use unit arrows with velocity magni-\ntude indicated by background isovels. This makes it easier\nto see flow directions in the extensive areas of very low\nvelocity.\n4.1. Horizontal Components of Velocity\n[28] The simulated near-surface and near-bed flow pat-\nterns in both bends are shown in Figure 5, along with the\nlocations of the sections used below to examine secondary\ncirculation and for reference purposes in describing flow\nstructures. Section A in each bend is on the face of the riffle\njust upstream of the sharp part of the bend. This is close to\nthe inflow to the bend-37 model, but well downstream of\nthe inflow to the bend-17 model. Sections C and D in each\nbend are near the apex and run through the inner-bank\nrecirculation eddies and the deepest parts of the pools.\nSection F in each case is just downstream of the reattach-\nment point. In bend 17 a final section (G) is marked in the\nnear-straight exit region of the bend.\n[29] The locally irregular geometry of these natural bends\ninevitably leads to a more complicated flow structure than\nin a laboratory channel or a CFD simulation of an idealized\nbend, but several large-scale features can be identified in\neach bend. Most are common to both bends, but there are\nsome differences. We identify eight features in the results.\n[30] 1. Although both bends have extensive areas of\nvery slow flow, extending from the inner bank to well past\nthe centerline, reverse flow is much more localized in bend\n17 than in bend 37. The center of rotation of the recircu-\nlation eddy in bend 37 is more than halfway across the\nchannel, whereas that in bend 17 is close to the inner bank.\nThe fine detail of the recirculating flow structure is therefore\nmore evident in bend 37 where it occupies far more of the\nbend. The reverse flow is strongest (>0.2 m s\u00011) near the\napex of the inner bank. The center of rotation is slightly\nfurther upstream and leftward at the surface than the bed,\nindicating that the axis of the recirculation vortex is not\nvertical. Likewise, reverse velocities extend further across\nthe channel at the surface than the bed, indicating a non-\nvertical separation plane. There are hints of the same\ncomplexity in bend 17 but its recirculation eddy is too\nsmall to be resolved in comparable detail.\n[31] 2. The velocity distribution entering bend 37 is\nalmost symmetric, with maximum velocity in midchannel,\nbut that entering bend 17 is asymmetric with the highest\nvelocity near the left bank and a secondary maximum near\nthe right bank. The existence of two filaments of high\nvelocity is a site-specific feature which can be expected to\ncomplicate the flow structure in the rest of bend 17.\n[32] 3. Despite the difference in extent of the recircula-\ntion eddies, flow separation and reattachment occur in about\nFERGUSON ET AL.: INNER-BANK RECIRCULATION IN MEANDERS ESG 2 - 7\nFigure 5.

See\ncolor version of this figure in the HTML.\nESG 2 - 8 FERGUSON ET AL.: INNER-BANK RECIRCULATION IN MEANDERS\nthe same locations in each bend. Flow at both surface and\nbed separates from the inner bank at or just upstream from\nwhere it starts to turn sharply (near A in bend 37, between B\nand C in bend 17), then reattaches about midway from the\napex to the end of the bend (between D and E in bend 17, E\nand F in bend 37). Flow near the separation and reattach-\nment points is very slow, with velocity magnitude below\n0.1 m s\u00011, and pressure at mid-height in the water column is\nbelow hydrostatic at these locations.\n[33] 4. The zone of reverse velocity is just the core of a\nmore extensive \u2018\u2018dead zone\u2019\u2019 of slow-flowing water. Taking\nthe 0.2 m s\u00011 isovels in Figure 5 as arbitrary limits, both\ndead zones have maximum surface width rather past the\napex (near section D in each bend). The pattern at the bed is\nFigure 6. Simulated secondary circulation at selected cross sections of the two bends. Section locations\nare shown in Figure 5. Contours show streamwise velocity relative to CFD grid, and vectors show\nresultant lateral and vertical components. See color version of this figure in the HTML.\nFERGUSON ET AL.: INNER-BANK RECIRCULATION IN MEANDERS ESG 2 - 9\ndifferent: low velocities extend less far across at the apex,\nbut occur further up and downstream, and extend furthest\nleft proximally (near section A in bend 17, B in bend 37)\nwhere there is a big vertical velocity gradient in midstream.\n[34] 5. There is substantial lateral asymmetry in the flow\ntoward and around the apex of each bend, with the full-\nwidth inflow converging asymmetrically into an outer-bank\nfree stream of considerably reduced width. This free stream\nmust have a rather greater downstream water discharge than\nthe stream as a whole, since it has to balance the upstream\ndischarge near the inner bank. Velocities toward the outer\nbank are higher than those near the inner bank by a factor of\n3 to 4, and along the proximal part of the outer bank the\ncomputed pressure at mid-height in the water column\nexceeds hydrostatic.\n[35] 6. Despite the constriction of downstream flow into\nthis relatively narrow free stream, there is a general decel-\neration of flow along the outer bank. This is due to the big\nincrease in depth from the shallow inflow to the deep pool\nnear the apex. Surface velocity near the outer bank falls by\naround 50% from inflow to apex in each bend, then increases\nslowly toward the shallower outlet. Bed velocity is more\nconstant; in bend 17 it decreases a little, whereas in bend 37\nit increases from <0.3 m s\u00011 at A and B to >0.4 m s\u00011 at C-E,\nthen decreases toward the outlet.\n[36] 7. Vector directions near the outer bank indicate\noutward flow at the surface, but inward flow near the bed,\nas far as the apex. The difference in direction is as much as\n45\u0001 in places, and lateral velocities are high but of opposite\nsign at the surface and bed. This is indicative of a helical\nmotion, as found in bends generally, but restricted here to\nthe outer bank before the apex.\n[37] 8. Beyond the apex, where the flow as a whole\nexpands asymmetrically to reoccupy the full channel width\nbeyond the dead zone, there is far less difference between\nsurface and bed flow directions. This suggests rapid decay\nof the helix. Lateral velocities reach 0.2 m s\u00011 to the right\nbetween E and F in bend 37, but hardly any secondary flow\nremains at the final cross sections.\n4.2. Vertical Velocity and Secondary Circulation\n[38] Figure 6 shows secondary-circulation (vw) vectors\nand isovels of streamwise velocity (u) in the cross sections\nlabeled in Figure 5. The plotted v components are relative to\nthe orientations of the sections, which in turn are those of\nthe boundary-fitted computational grid. These orientations\ndo not necessarily yield zero cross-stream discharge in a\nsection, let alone at a vertical, so helical motion (if present)\nmight not be revealed by closed loops of vw vectors in the\nway that is inevitable when field measurements are reori-\nented to give zero cross-stream discharge at a vertical.\nHowever, it would still be revealed by differences in the\nsign of v at surface and bed, or differences in the magnitude\nof v at surface and bed combined with opposite signs of w on\nleft and right.\n[39] The plots confirm point 7 above: the existence of a\nstrong outer-bank helix in the first half of each bend\n(sections A\u2013C), with plunging at the bank and upwelling\nin midstream. As noted in points 5 and 6, its strength is\nenhanced by vortex stretching as the free stream narrows\npast the recirculation zone. This effect is, however, reduced\nby the increase in depth from riffle to pool. The cross-\nsection isovels show that the fastest current becomes\ndepressed below the surface, to the extent that the vertical\nvelocity gradient is reversed in much of the outer part of\nbend 37. The axis of the vortex is well to the left of center\nthroughout, so the plunging near the outer bank is much\nstronger than the upwelling on the midstream side of the\nvortex.\n[40] As noted in point 8, patterns of upwelling and\ndownwelling weaken considerably beyond the apex of each\nbend. A decay in vorticity is to be expected as the cross-\nsection area of the free stream increases past the recircula-\ntion. By section D in each bend the remains of the vortex\ncan be discerned around the high-velocity core near the base\nof the bank, but the upwelling water nearer the surface no\nlonger moves leftward toward the bank, and is shown as\nmoving rightward at E and F. The impression of rightward\nFigure 7. (top) Planimetric and (bottom) oblique views of\nselected streamlines in the simulation of bend 37 to show\nconnections between free stream and recirculation eddy.\nTop map shows surface streamlines. Bottom view is looking\nupstream and downward, with the inner-bank apex on the\nleft and the outer bank on the right.\nESG 2 - 10 FERGUSON ET AL.: INNER-BANK RECIRCULATION IN MEANDERS\nsurface flow at E is entirely due to the nonorthogonality of\nthis section to the outer bank of bend 17 (see the vectors in\nFigure 5), and is exaggerated in bend 37 for the same\nreason, but this is not a factor in either the lack of leftward\nflow at D or the presence of rightward flow at F.\n[41] Visualization of streamlines from carefully chosen\nstarting points in both bends revealed some interchange of\nfluid between the outer-bank helix and the inner-bank\nrecirculation eddy. Figure 7 illustrates this for bend 37.\nThe recirculation in bend 17 is impossible to show clearly\nbecause of its small size but shares some of the same\nfeatures. The planimetric representation of surface stream-\nlines in Figure 7 (top) confirms the separation and reat-\ntachment points inferred from the vector map in Figure 5.\nThe three-dimensional view of selected streamlines in\nFigure 7 (bottom) reveals further detail, and two features\nin particular.\n[42] 1. As the outer-bank helix decays past the apex of\neach bend, upwelling water on its right-hand side starts to\nescape rightward instead of spiraling leftward across the\nsurface to the outer bank. This is suggested by the orienta-\ntions of uv vectors in Figure 5 (between D and E in bend 17,\nbetween E and F in bend 37) and vw vectors in Figure 6\n(sections D and E of each bend), and confirmed by some of\nthe streamlines halfway across the foreground of Figure 7.\nThese streamlines follow a hairpin path into the dead zone,\nstarting with u > 0, v \u0007 0, w > 0 but moving through u \u0007 0,\nv > 0, w \u0007 0 to u < 0, v \u0007 0, w < 0. In bend 17, escape is not\ndirectly to the recirculation eddy but to the extensive dead\nzone of low positive u, within which there is another\ncounterclockwise helix.\n[43] 2. Streamlines within the extensive recirculation\neddy in bend 37 show complex paths involving upward\nand downward movement as well as circulation in plan\nview. Flow is generally inward and downward distally\n(sections D and E in Figures 5 and 6) but outward and\nupward proximally (section C) where streamlines starting in\nthe reverse flow near the inner bank are reentrained into the\nfree stream, making an upstream-to-downstream hairpin\nturn (toward top left of Figure 7). This is hinted at in Figure 6\nin the way the secondary vectors near the point-bar slope\nmerge into the outer-bank helix. The same can be seen\nnearer the inner bank of section C in bend 17.\n5. Discussion\n[44] The spatial structure of time-averaged flow in real\nriver bends is inevitably more complicated than that in\nidealized laboratory experiments or CFD simulations. Both\nthe channel geometry and the inflow velocity distribution\nare less regular in the field than in the laboratory, so\nquestions arise as to which flow features are generic to a\nclass of bends and which are specific to a particular\nconfiguration. Some insight can be gained by looking at\nthe similarities and differences between the two bends we\nhave modeled, and the differences between their common\nfeatures and those of the flow in \u2018\u2018classical\u2019\u2019 bends without\nseparation and recirculation.\n[45] The defining feature of the flow structure in this class\nof bends is separation and reverse flow at the inner bank.\nFlow separates near the most sharply curved point on the\ninner bank, and the expansion zone past the apex contains a\nrecirculation eddy (RE below) with a near-vertical axis of\nrotation. The REs in the two right-hand bends studied here\nrotate clockwise when looking downward, but the circula-\ntion would be counterclockwise in a left-hand bend. Down-\nstream flow reattaches to the inner bank within about one\nchannel width, but a dead zone of small downstream\nvelocity extends further upstream and downstream at the\nbed. Both bends have very low radius of curvature relative\nto channel width, and the primary cause of separation\nappears to be the abruptness with which the inner bank\nchanges direction. The momentum of the near-bank flow\ncauses it to continue in a fairly straight path, leaving a zone\nof low velocity in what is effectively a sudden lateral\nexpansion. A second aspect of the morphology of both\nbends is a pronounced deepening of the channel from the\ninflow riffle to the apex pool. This might promote separa-\ntion by reducing mean velocity and momentum toward the\napex and providing more room vertically for secondary\ncirculation. This speculation could be tested by further CFD\nsimulations with the same planforms but different long\nprofiles.\n[46] The other dominant feature in both bends is a free\nstream which runs along the outer bank, outside the RE, and\nexhibits helical motion. The outer-bank helix (OBH below)\nis counterclockwise looking downstream, so that surface\nflow is toward the bank and near-bed flow away from the\nbank. The OBH has the same curvature-induced origin as in\nmeander bends without recirculation: fast surface water\nimpinges on the bank to create superelevation which drives\nan inward near-bed flow. However, there are three distinc-\ntive (though not unique) features about the free stream and\nits helicity.\n[47] First, the helical motion is restricted to the outer part\nof the channel. This can also happen through topographic\nsteering over a point bar [as first described by Dietrich and\nSmith, 1983], but seldom if ever to the extent that helicity is\nrestricted to only a quarter of the width as at the apex of\nbend 37.\n[48] Second, the plunging at the outer bank before the\napex is so strong that the highest velocities are depressed\nprogressively nearer the bed. Submergence of the high-\nvelocity core is not unknown in meander bends [Bathurst et\nal., 1979; Frothingham and Rhoads, 2003], and is also\ncharacteristic of confluences with flow separation [Rhoads\nand Kenworthy, 1995], but it is unusually pronounced in\nbend 37 where the fastest flow is below mid-height at D and\nnear the talweg at E, giving a reversed vertical velocity\ngradient.\n[49] Third, the OBH is strongest proximally, where the\nbulk of the incoming flow converges on the outer bank not\njust passively as the bank starts to turn but also through the\ndeflecting effect of the inner bank RE. At the apex the helix\nis restricted to a relatively narrow strip along the outer bank,\nwhere there is strong downwelling, but beyond the apex the\nhelix first weakens and then disappears. This is different\nfrom the usual situation in less sharply curved bends, where\nthe helix in one bend is generally regarded as surviving into\nthe next before being replaced by one rotating in the\nopposite direction [e.g., Thorne and Hey, 1979]. It also\ncontrasts with Leeder and Bridge\u2019s [1975] discussion of\ninner-bank separation in bends of intertidal creeks: they\nspeculated that maximum velocity and bank erosion\nFERGUSON ET AL.: INNER-BANK RECIRCULATION IN MEANDERS ESG 2 - 11\noccurred in the distal half of a bend where the effective flow\nwidth is reduced past the recirculation eddy, whereas we\nfind it further upstream because the reduction in effective\nwidth is more than offset by the increase in depth from riffle\nto pool. The rapid weakening of the OBH in our study\nbends is enhanced by vortex stretching as the free stream\ndiverges asymmetrically to reoccupy the whole width of the\nchannel past the distal end of the RE. This suppresses the\nsecondary circulation, so that the flow at the bend exit is\nessentially parallel. Frothingham and Rhoads [2003] simi-\nlarly found that helicity generated in the first sharply curved\npart of a compound bend decayed completely as the free\nstream expanded toward the inner bank past a point bar.\n[50] The conjunction of the two main vortices (RE and\nOBH) gives pronounced lateral asymmetry in streamwise\nvelocity toward and past the apex of each bend. Thus there\nis strong shear between relatively fast downstream flow near\nthe outer bank and slow downstream or reverse flow nearer\nthe inner bank. In the time-averaged CFD simulations\ndescribed here, connections between the OBH and RE are\nto be found up and downstream of the latter. At its distal\nend, upwelling fluid on the midchannel side of the OBH\nescapes into the low-velocity, low-pressure zone toward the\nreattachment point inner bank and is turned upstream; then\non approaching the separation point upstream of the apex,\nfluid is entrained back into the upwelling side of the\ndeveloping OBH to complete a double-hairpin loop of\nrecirculation. However, our field observations suggest there\nis also direct mixing across the essentially longitudinal shear\nzone between the OBH and RE, with frequent shedding of\nsmall Kelvin-Helmholz vortices. Such vortices have been\nreported from sharp bends in intertidal creeks [Leeder and\nBridges, 1975] and from shear zones at confluences [e.g.,\nBiron et al., 1993; Bradbrook et al., 2000b; Sukhodolov and\nRhoads, 2001]. Strong turbulent diffusion in this manner\nmay also be a further factor in the rapid weakening of the\nOBH past the apex of each bend.\n[51] The main difference between the two bends is the\nmuch smaller extent of the recirculation eddy in bend 17.\nThis probably relates mainly to the lower angle of turn and\nless extreme R\/W ratio of this bend compared to bend 37.\nNevertheless bend 17 still has an extensive dead zone,\nbecause although the RE is small it is separated from the\nOBH by a wide midchannel area of low downstream\nvelocity. Thus there are two shear layers in this bend: a\nmain one at the mid-channel side of the outer-bank free\nstream, and a milder one between the slow flow in the\ncenter of the channel and the reverse flow close to the inner\nbank. As noted in paragraph 42 and seen in Figure 6,\nparticularly at D, the zone of slow downstream flow\ncontains an counterclockwise secondary circulation. This\nprobably reflects the asymmetric inflow to this bend, fastest\nnear the left bank, slowest in midstream, and of intermediate\nvelocity near the right bank. The left-bank jet leads into the\nOBH but the inner-bank separation and RE is created by the\ntendency of the right-bank inflow to continue straight on,\ndiagonally across the channel through the low-velocity zone\nin midstream, through a combination of high inner-bank\ncurvature and topographic steering by the small point bar\nthat is present at the apex. This right-bank jet is eventually\ndeflected rightward as it converges on the OBH. Since this\nhappens further downstream at the surface than at the bed\n(because of the difference in orientation between near-bed\nand near-surface flow in the OBH), an overturning motion\n(counterclockwise vw vorticity) is imparted to the jet. We\nthink this more complex pattern is a site-specific outcome of\nthe unusual inflow to bend 17, and that the simpler flow\nstructure in bend 37 is more generic.\n[52] The intensity of recirculation in the latter bend is\nsuch that the RE extends into the path of the incoming flow,\nthereby deflecting it. This is an important difference\nbetween the two bends, and shows how separation can\ngenerate hydrodynamic phenomena of sufficient strength\nnot only to maintain their spatial structure in the face of\nstrong free stream flow, but also to influence the geometry\nof the free stream flow (as seen particularly in the deflection\nof surface flow vectors in Figure 5).\n6. Conclusions\n[53] The flow structures in these two bends share many\ngeneric features but exhibit some contingent differences.\nThe generic features are a recirculation eddy at the inner\nbank and a free stream at the outer bank within which\nhelicity first increases, then decays through vortex stretch-\ning. The controlling factors for the development of these\nphenomena seem to be high channel curvature, inflow\ndistribution to the bend, and bed topography. We regard\nhigh planform curvature as a generic factor, necessary for\nseparation to occur. The inflow distribution is a modifying\nfactor giving site-specific differences between bends,\nenhancing or diminishing the pressure gradients induced\nby curvature according to the angle at which flow impinges\non the outer bank and the speed of the flow past the inner-\nbank apex. The pronounced riffle-pool bed topography of\nthe River Dean is a contributory factor to some of the\ncommon features of the study bends, and is probably a\nfactor in the extent of the recirculation eddy in bend 37, but\nit is not a necessary condition for recirculation (which has\nbeen observed in laboratory channels without pools and\nriffles). Once recirculation has developed, the dead zone\nacts as a fourth factor, modifying the flow structure through\nthe interaction and shear between the region of much slower\nor reverse flow close to the inner bank and the free stream\nnear the outer bank.\n[54] The presence and nature of recirculation may alter\nwith flow stage as the relative influence of these controlling\nfactors varies. For example, the influence of the upstream\nriffle bed topography is likely to reduce as discharge\nincreases. Our field observations suggest that large recircu-\nlation eddies exist even in high flows, and in ongoing\nresearch we are investigating this by running validated\nCFD models at higher discharges.\n[55] The existence of large areas of slow downstream or\nreverse flow in bends like these has important implications.\nThe velocity patterns discussed above imply maximum\nboundary shear stress near the outer bank, as in the classical\nmodel, but upstream of the apex rather than downstream of\nit. This has implications for bank erosion and meander\nmigration, and may also be a precursor to the development\nof outer bank flow separation. The inner-bank zones of slow\nflow also severely affect the sediment dynamics of the\nsystem and act to accumulate patches of fine sediment.\nOur results show that CFD models can be fitted successfully\nESG 2 - 12 FERGUSON ET AL.: INNER-BANK RECIRCULATION IN MEANDERS\nto bend flow with separation, so they offer a valuable new\ntool for investigating the implications of separation.\n[56] Acknowledgments.
