The time evolution\nof the distribution function is governed by a continuity equation,\nknown as the Vlasov or collisionless Boltzmann equation,\ndt F = \u2202t F + v \u00b7 \u2202x F \u2212 \u2202x\u0004 \u00b7 \u2202vF = 0, (1)\nwhere \u0004(x) denotes the gravitational potential, which for a self-\ngravitating stellar system is given by the Poisson integral\n\u0004(x, t) = \u2212G\n\u222b\nF(x\u2032,v, t)\n|x \u2212 x\u2032| d\n3x\u2032 d3v. (2)\nThe main objective of galactic dynamics is to solve this system of\nequations. This is a difficult task and most analytic work is restricted\nto stationary or near-stationary solutions. For these a number of\ntheoretical concepts have been developed, such as Jeans\u2019 theorem\nand perturbation theory. Galactic dynamics far from equilibrium on\nthe other hand, such as in a galaxy merger or collapse, are almost\nentirely treated with N-body simulations, i.e. numerical solutions\nof equations (1) and (2).\nAs emphasized already by He\u00b4non (1964) and Lynden-Bell\n(1967), the constancy of F(x, v, t) ensured by the collisionless\nBoltzmann equation (1) is of little practical use in non-equilibrium\nsituations, because of mixing. Phase-space elements of high density\n\u0001E-mail: wd11@astro.le.ac.uk\nare stretched out and folded with elements of low density, very much\nas cream is stirred into coffee. As for this example, the elements\nbecome ever thinner until any measurement of F(x, v, t) becomes\nimpossible. In other words, the finite resolution of the system breaks\nthe validity of the continuum limit. In such a case, the system is bet-\nter described by a local average of F, known as the coarse-grained\ndistribution function \u00afF(x,v, t). In fact, any measurement can only\n(hope to) recover this local average.\nThere are important differences between mixing in a collision-\nless system such as a galaxy and a collisional system such as a\ngas, where mixing is driven by short-range interactions. In galaxies,\nstrong forms of mixing are caused by non-local large-scale dynam-\nics and occur only away from equilibrium but generally promote\nequilibrium. Hence, mixing is never complete in the sense of con-\nvergence to a maximum-entropy state \u2013 in fact, it can be shown that\nsuch a state does not exist (Tremaine, Henon & Lynden-Bell 1986).\nA mild version of mixing is phase-mixing or similar \u2018weak mixing\u2019\nprocesses, caused by secular evolution of stellar systems [for in-\nstance, the merging of regular orbits into a sea of chaos mixes their\nphase-space densities (Merritt & Valluri 1996)]. Stronger forms of\nmixing are \u2018chaotic mixing\u2019 or \u2018violent relaxation\u2019, which is driven\nby large-scale fluctuations of the gravitational potential.\nA simple example of mixing is presented in Fig. 1: volumes of\nF = 1 (black) get stretched out (e.g. at t = 100) and folded together\nwith volumes of F = 0 (white) until any distinction is barred by the\nfinite resolution of any observation. So, while at t \u0001 1000 in this\nexample the fine-grained distribution function F(x, v, t) displays a\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPhase-space mixing and merging of cusps 893\nFigure 1. Demonstration of phase mixing. The evolution of a bunch of \u223c105 phase-space points in the 1D Hamiltonian H = p2\/2 + |q| of a point mass in\n1D gravity is shown. The fine-grained distribution function is either equal to one (black) or zero (white), but at late times, a smooth distribution appears.\nvery complex pattern, equilibrium is reached in the coarse-grained\nsense, since \u2202t \u00afF = 0.\nUnfortunately, \u00afF does not obey a simple continuity equation,\nsuch as (1), and hence describing its evolution is a considerable\nproblem. Lynden-Bell (1967) derived a distribution function for the\nend-state of violent relaxation assuming the conservation of phase-\nspace volumes of given density according to equation (1). However,\nmixing does not conserve volumes of fixed density in the coarse-\ngrained sense (e.g. Mathur 1988) and, not surprisingly, the resulting\ntheory is inconsistent (Arad & Lynden-Bell 2005). A similar attempt\nby Nakamura (2000) suffers from the same deficiency (Arad &\nLynden-Bell 2005). Another approach to the dynamics of violent\nrelaxation was taken by Chavanis (1998) in deriving a time evolution\nequation for \u00afF . While this is a promising attempt, its practicality is\nlimited and unlikely to surpass that of N-body simulations.\nAn obvious constraint on the evolution of \u00afF(x,v, t) is that its\nmaximum value \u00afFmax cannot increase. While this is applicable\nonly if \u00afF(x,v) is initially bounded, a much stronger constraint on\n\u00afF(x,v, t) is provided by a mixing theorem, a relation between the\nproperties of \u00afF(x,v) before and after a mixing process. Tremaine\net al. (1986) considered H-functionals of \u00afF(x,v, t), which are de-\nfined as1\nH [ \u00afF] = \u2212\n\u222b\nC\n(\n\u00afF(x,v)\n)\nd3x d3v, (3)\n1 The traditional definition in statistical mechanics differs by a sign.\nwhere C is a convex function with C(0) = 0. Tremaine et al. (see\nalso Tolman 1938) showed that coarse-graining always increases\nH-functionals and concluded that mixing generally results in an\nincrease of H [ \u00afF], a result known as the \u2018H theorem\u2019.2\nAccording to Tremaine et al. (1986), a function \u00afF2 is called more\nmixed than \u00afF1, if for all H-functionals H [ \u00afF2] \u0002 H [ \u00afF1]. In partic-\nular, if \u00afF2 originates from \u00afF1 by mixing, \u00afF2 is more mixed than\n\u00afF1. The H-functional for C( f ) = f ln f is equal to (k B times) the\nentropy and even increases for collisional systems. Tremaine et al.\nprove a mixing theorem stating that \u00afF2 is more mixed than \u00afF1 if\nand only if M2(V ) \u0003M1(V ) for all V , where the function M(V )\nis defined in terms of the cumulative volume and mass\nV ( f ) \u2261\n\u222b\n\u00afF(x,v)> f\nd3x d3v (4)\nM( f ) \u2261\n\u222b\n\u00afF(x,v)> f\n\u00afF(x,v) d3x d3v (5)\n2 This latter step, however, has been shown to be conceptually incorrect if\none allows for arbitrary methods of coarse-graining (Soker 1996). Indeed,\ncounter-examples to the mixing theorem can easily be constructed by tuning\nthe coarse-graining (Kandrup 1987; Sridhar 1987). It seems that the problem\narises from problems with the very concept of coarse-graining, which is\nlacking precise pre-conditions or even a precise definition. However, this\ndoes not imply that a statement like the H theorem cannot generally be\nmade or even that mixing was unimportant for stellar dynamics. I postpone\na more detailed discussion of these issues to Section 3.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 360, 892\u2013900\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n894 W. Dehnen\nviaM(V ( f )) \u2261 M( f ). This is a stronger statement than that of in-\ncreasing entropy, since it holds for all values of V . Unfortunately, the\nusability of this theorem is restricted by the complicated definition\nof M(V ), which evades a simple interpretation and manipulation.\nFor instance, M(V ) is not additive and, if V(f ) is not invertible, it\nis not well defined, as is the case for the initial state of the example\nin Fig. 1, where V = 1 for f \u0003 1 and V = 0 for f > 1 (known as\nthe \u2018water-bag model\u2019).\nThe purpose of this paper is to present (see Section 2) a novel\napproach to mixing which is conceptually different from that of\nTremaine et al. and avoids their conceptual problems. This leads\nto a novel form of the mixing theorem in terms of a new concept,\nthe excess-mass function, which is simple to apply and easy to\ninterpret. I discuss the relation to Tremaine et al.\u2019s work and the\ncontroversy about it in Section 3. In Section 4, simple examples are\ngiven and the asymptotic behaviour at small and large values of \u00afF\ncorresponding, respectively, to large and small radii are considered.\nThese are applied in Section 5 to the merging of cusped galaxies.\nFinally, Section 6 discusses the applicability to N-body simulations\nand Section 7 concludes.\n2 M I X I N G\nIn order to simplify the following discussion, it is worth introducing\nthe \u2018volume distribution function\u2019 (e.g. Tremaine et al. 1986)\nv( f ) =\n\u222b\n\u03b4\n(\n\u00afF(x,v) \u2212 f ) d3x d3v, (6)\nwhich refers to the phase-space volume at which \u00afF(x,v) = f .\nUsing v(f ), we can re-write the cumulative mass and volume and\nany H-functional as\nV ( f ) =\n\u222b \u221e\nf\nv(\u03c6) d\u03c6, (7)\nM( f ) =\n\u222b \u221e\nf\n\u03c6v(\u03c6) d\u03c6, (8)\nH [ \u00afF] = \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nv(\u03c6) C(\u03c6) d\u03c6. (9)\nNote that v( f ), V ( f ), M( f ) and M(V ) are functionals of \u00afF(x,v)\nas well as functions of their parameter f or V . We can now model\nmixing directly as an operation on phase-space volumes.\n2.1 Infinitesimal mixing events\nThe process of mixing and subsequent coarse-graining of the dis-\ntribution function can be described as a sequence of infinitesimal\nmixing events in which a phase-space element with infinitesimal\nvolume dV l and density f l mixes completely with another volume\ndV h having density f h \u0002 f l. Because of conservation of mass and\nof phase-space volume, the resulting element has volume dV l +\ndV h and density\nfm = dVl fl + dVh fhdVl + dVh (10)\n(Mathur 1988). The change in the volume distribution function due\nto such an event is\ndv( f ) = (dVl + dVh) \u03b4( f \u2212 fm) \u2212 dVl \u03b4( f \u2212 fl) \u2212 dVh \u03b4( f \u2212 fh).\n(11)\nMixing events with f l = f h do not affect v(f ) and hence may be\ncalled \u2018adiabatic\u2019.\nFigure 2. In a plot of cumulative volume V (\u03c6) versus phase-space density\n\u03c6, the excess-mass D(f ) is given by the horizontally shaded region (equa-\ntion 14), which equals M( f ) (total shaded region) minus f V ( f ) (vertically\nshaded; equation 15).\n2.2 A lemma on mixing\nConsider the following function\nD( f ) \u2261\n\u222b\n\u00afF(x,v)> f\n[ \u00afF(x,v) \u2212 f ] d3x d3v, (12)\nwhich may be re-written as\nD( f ) =\n\u222b \u221e\nf\n(\u03c6 \u2212 f ) v(\u03c6) d\u03c6 (13)\n=\n\u222b \u221e\nf\nV (\u03c6) d\u03c6, (14)\n= M( f ) \u2212 f V ( f ). (15)\nAs is obvious from these relations, the excess-mass function D(f )\nrefers to the excess mass due to values of \u00afF > f (see also Fig. 2).\nMixing lemma. Mixing of phase-space volumes where \u00afF(x,v) <\nf with volumes where \u00afF(x,v) > f decreases D(f ); other mixing\nprocesses leave D(f ) unchanged.\nProof . First, consider an infinitesimal mixing event. The changes\nit imposes on D(f ) are easily found from equations (11) and (13):\ndD( f ) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n0 for f < fl,\n\u2212( f \u2212 fl) dVl for fl < f < fm,\n\u2212( fh \u2212 f ) dVh for fm \u0003 f < fh,\n0 for fh < f .\n(16)\nThus, dD( f ) < 0 for f l < f < f h and 0 otherwise. Since the\nwhole mixing process is a sequence of infinitesimal mixing events,\nthe change in D(f ) is the integral over many infinitesimal changes\ndD( f ) and the lemma follows. \u0004\nThe largest change of D(f ) due to an infinitesimal mixing event\noccurs at f = f m and is dD( f m) = \u2212 | f h \u2212 f l| dV ldV h\/(dV l +\ndV h).\n2.3 Further properties of the excess-mass function\nApart from the relations (13)\u2013(15), the function D(f ) has the fol-\nlowing properties. First,\nD\u2032( f ) = \u2212V ( f ), (17)\nD\u2032\u2032( f ) = v( f ). (18)\nSince both v(f ) and V(f ) are non-negative, this implies that D(f )\nis non-negative and monotonically declining with everywhere non-\nnegative curvature.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 360, 892\u2013900\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nPhase-space mixing and merging of cusps 895\nSecondly, since in order for M( f \u2192 \u221e) not to diverge f 2v( f )\n\u2192 0 as f \u2192 \u221e, and because of equation (18),\nlim\nf \u2192\u221e\nD( f ) = 0. (19)\nThirdly, for a system with finite mass,\nD(0) = Mtotal. (20)\nFourthly, changes in D(f ) are related to a change of the entropy\nS via\n\u0007S = \u2212kB\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u0007D( f )\nf d f , (21)\nwhich becomes obvious at the end of the next section.\nFinally, the combined excess-mass function of several disjoint\nsystems (the distribution functions of which do not overlap) is sim-\nply given by the sum of the individual excess-mass functions. In gen-\neral, i.e. for partially overlapping systems, the excess-mass function\nis super-additive:\nD1+2( f ) \u0002 D1( f ) + D2( f ). (22)\nThis is directly related to the subadditivity of the entropy (e.g. Wehrl\n1978) and follows from the definition (12) of D(f ) and the fact that\n\u00afF1+2 = \u00afF1 + \u00afF2.\n2.4 A mixing theorem\nThe above lemma is closely related to a statement made by Mathur\n(1988). In fact, his function P(f ), for which he only gives the second\nderivative, is identical to the change in D(f ) induced by mixing and\nhis equation (7) is equivalent to my (16).\nThe relation to the theorem given by Tremaine et al. (1986) and\noutlined in the beginning of this section is more subtle. In the proof\nof their theorem, Tremaine et al. construct the function D(f ), be-\ncause it actually is (the negative of) an H-functional of \u00afF . In fact,\nas pointed out by Mathur (1988), D(f ) and M(V ) are related by\na Legendre transformation,3 as is obvious from equation (15). In\nparticular, M\u2032(V ) = f ,M\u2032\u2032(V ) = 1\/v( f ) and D\u2032 (equation 17)\nis the (negative of the) inverse of M\u2032, by definition of a Legendre\ntransform. This is directly related to the fact that(\n\u2202D\n\u2202\u03c4\n)\nf\n=\n(\n\u2202M\n\u2202\u03c4\n)\nV\n, (23)\nwhere \u03c4 is a time-like variable describing the evolution due to\nmixing. Equation (23) in conjunction with the theorem given by\nTremaine et al. (1986) implies the following alternative form of the\nmixing theorem.\nMixing theorem. The distribution function \u00afF2(x,v) is more mixed\nthan \u00afF1(x,v) if and only if D2( f ) \u0003 D1( f ) for all f .\nProof . Suppose \u00afF2 is more mixed than \u00afF1. Then D2( f )\u0003 D1( f ),\nsince D(f ) is the negative of an H-functional of \u00afF(x,v) with the\nconvex function\nC( \u00afF) =\n{\n0 for \u00afF \u0003 f ,\n\u00afF \u2212 f for \u00afF > f . (24)\nConversely, suppose D2( f )\u0003 D1( f ) for all f . From equation (9),\nH2 \u2212 H1 = \u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n(v2 \u2212 v1)C d f . (25)\n3 Mathur failed to derive D(f ) itself, but based his statement on equation\n(18), which he used as a definition; also strangely he considered negative\nvalues for f .\nIntegrating by parts and using V \u2032 = \u2212v yields\nH2 \u2212 H1 = (V2 \u2212 V1)C\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u221e\n0\n\u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n(V2 \u2212 V1)C \u2032 d f . (26)\nThe first term on the right-hand side vanishes, and integrating the\nsecond term by parts using (17) gives\nH2 \u2212 H1 = (D2 \u2212 D1)C \u2032\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u221e\n0\n\u2212\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n(D2 \u2212 D1)C \u2032\u2032 d f . (27)\nAgain the first term on the right-hand side vanishes; the second\nterm is non-negative, since D2 \u0003 D1 by assumption and C \u2032\u2032 \u0002 0\nby definition of convexity. Hence H 2 \u0002 H 1, which completes the\nproof. \u0004\nTogether with the above lemma, this theorem is another proof of\nthe H theorem (mixing increases or preserves but never decreases\nany H-functional).\nSince the entropy S is the H-functional with C( f ) = f ln f , the\nrelation (21) between changes in entropy and D(f ) follows directly\nfrom equation (27).\n2.5 Diluting phase-space density\nThe theorem above is more useful than the equivalent theorem by\nTremaine et al. (1986) because the function D(f ) is easier to com-\nprehend and manipulate than M(V ). In particular, the additivity\nof D(f ) is of great value. However, the lemma of Section 2.2 is of\neven larger practical significance, because it allows us to relate the\nchange in D(f ) directly to mixing events \u2018across\u2019 \u00afF = f .\nThe total change of D(f ) in a mixing process may be obtained\nby integrating the infinitesimal change (16) over a function which\nspecifies for each pair ( f l, f h) how much phase space at f l mixes\nwith how much phase space at f h (Mathur 1988). However, it is\nnot clear how such a function may be obtained; moreover, in the\nend the information contained in this function is reduced to the one-\ndimensional change in D(f ). One may instead assume a simple form\nfor this function, resulting in simple mixing models.\nFor instance, one may assume that all of v(f ) gets mixed with an\nempty volume of size \u03b1( f )v( f ). This complete \u2018mixing with air\u2019\nsimply dilutes the phase-space density \u00afF \u2192 \u00afF\/[1 + \u03b1( \u00afF)] and\ngives\nDfinal( f ) = Dinitial([1 + \u03b1( f )] f ). (28)\nThe dilution function \u03b1( f ) is always well defined and can be mea-\nsured directly from N-body experiments, by estimating D(f ) be-\nfore and after a violent mixing process. Essentially \u03b1( f ) gives the\nequivalent amount of mixing with air necessary to generate a certain\nevolution of D(f ).\n3 C OA R S E - G R A I N I N G\n3.1 Conceptual problems\nAs mentioned in footnote 2 above, the H theorem of Tremaine et al.\n(1986) has met immediate rejection (Dejonghe 1987; Kandrup 1987;\nSridhar 1987). These authors provided simple counter-examples of\nnon-mixing systems, the H-functionals of which are not conserved\nor even decreasing and pointed to the following conceptual prob-\nlem in the argument. Tremaine et al. have actually only proven\nthat H-functionals increase as a consequence of coarse-graining:\nH [ \u00afF(x,v)] \u0002 H [F(x,v)] independent of the actual dynamics or\nindeed mixing. From that, they argued that initially \u00afF = F (which\ncan be guaranteed by definition of the arrow of time; Tremaine,\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 360, 892\u2013900\n at :: on N\novem\nber 23, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n896 W. Dehnen\nprivate communication), but \u00afF \b= F at a later time t, and hence\nH [ \u00afF(0)] \u0003 H [ \u00afF(t)]. However, this argument does not guarantee\nthat H [ \u00afF(0)] \u0003 H [ \u00afF(t1)] \u0003 H [ \u00afF(t)] at intermediate times t1.\nUnfortunately, this controversy undermined the whole subject of\nmixing in stellar dynamics. Some sceptics argue that the fine-grained\ndistribution function never suffers information loss and hence that\nthe H theorem is a pure artefact of coarse-graining (implying that\nthe entropy of a collisionless stellar system is constant). This argu-\nment, however, relies on the infinite resolution of the fine-grained\ndistribution function and ignores the fact that no stellar system can\nsupport infinite resolution. The fine-grained distribution function\nand the collisionless Boltzmann equation only give an approximate\ndescription of collisionless stellar dynamics (e.g. Dejonghe 1987).\nIn the presence of mixing, the continuum limit, on which this approx-\nimation rests, becomes invalid. Mixing is an irreversible process as\ninformation concerning the state prior to mixing is lost, represent-\ning a true entropy increase in the sense understood by Boltzmann\n(Merritt 1999).\nThe conceptual problems related to the H theorem originate from\nthe fact that the details of and requirements for the coarse-graining\noperation are not specified and hence are usually considered unim-\nportant. Many authors consider a static coarse-graining operation,\nsuch as averaging over time-independent macro cells or convolu-\ntion with a window function. For such methods of coarse-graining\nSoker (1996) showed that H [ \u00afF] does not obey an H theorem.4 The\nreason is easily understood when considering a non-mixing non-\nequilibrium (e.g. periodic) system. Since the system evolves, the\neffectively resolved mass per fixed macro cell evolves too, so that\nH [ \u00afF] is not necessarily conserved.\n3.2 A novel interpretation of coarse-graining\nIn this situation, it is instructive to consider the proof of the H theo-\nrem from the previous section. Unlike Tremaine et al.\u2019s proof, it does\nnot employ coarse-graining with finite macro cells. Rather mixing is\ndescribed directly as averaging of (i.e. an integral over) infinitesimal\nphase-space volumes. In this description, the astrophysical process\nof mixing (and the resulting loss of information) is accounted for,\nin our description of the system, by a local averaging, the coarse-\ngraining. Thus, mixing and coarse-graining are intimately related\nand the latter must not be considered arbitrary.\nThis is directly related to the interpretation of the coarse-grained\ndistribution function \u00afF . Traditionally, \u00afF is introduced, because its\nfine-grained pendant F does not tend to equilibrium, but under-\ngoes ever stronger small-scale fluctuations (e.g. Chavanis 1998). In\nthis picture, \u00afF gives an otherwise unspecified, finite-resolution rep-\nresentation of the system. As already mentioned, the fine-grained\nfluctuations of F will eventually break the validity of the continuum\napproximation, i.e. below some level, these fluctuations are artificial\nand not representative of the actual stellar system.\nThese arguments suggest the interpretation of \u00afF as our best pos-\nsible description of the stellar system, avoiding the artefacts of its\nfine-grained counterpart. In this interpretation, coarse-graining must\nmeet the following conditions.\n(1) In the limit of a system with infinite resolution: \u00afF \u2192 F .\n(2) \u00afF must be a faithful representation of the system.\n(3) In the absence of mixing: dt \u00afF = 0.\n4 As a simple example consider F to be the sum of two \u03b4-functions. If the\ntwo points are close enough to be within one macro cell, \u00afFmax is twice as\nlarge as otherwise.\nThe first two conditions imply that coarse-graining must be local.\nThe second condition ensures that coarse-graining only deletes in-\nformation in F but not in our description of the stellar system, in\nparticular \u00af\u00afF = \u00afF . This means that coarse-graining is performed on\nthe local resolution scale of the system itself, which seems the most\nnatural scale to use, but excludes static coarse-graining. In particular,\nany moment of the stellar system must agree (within its statistical\nuncertainty) with the corresponding moment of \u00afF . Finally, the last\ncondition guarantees that \u00afF is altered by mixing only, i.e. under\nordinary non-mixing circumstances all information concerning the\nsystem is preserved in \u00afF . This immediately warrants the H theorem.\nIt is not clear, whether and how these conditions can be met in a\npractical implementation. However, even if we could only generate\nan approximation to this ideal, the above conditions and the under-\npinning interpretation were still valuable. For instance, we would\nallow for an approximation error \u02c6\u00afF \u2212 \u00afF (with \u00b7\u02c6 denoting approx-\nimation), which in turn might result in spurious but accountable\nviolations of the H theorem. Clearly, a more detailed investigation\nof these issues is beyond the scope of this paper.\nWe should stress that the idea of \u00afF(x,v, t) being the best possible\ndescription of the stellar system is not necessarily consistent with\nother approaches. For instance, Chavanis (1998, see also Chavanis &\nBouchet 2005) consider \u00afF to contain truly reduced information and,\nhence, the fluctuations of F to be (at least partially) real rather than\nentirely artificial. It may be possible to reconcile this with our ideas\nby altering the above conditions to allow for an arbitrary resolution\n(in terms of the mass or number of stars per resolution element)\nwithout spoiling the H theorem \u2013 however, then dt \u00afF \b= 0 because\nof the forces generated by the fluctuations (Chavanis 1998).\n4 E X A M P L E S\n4.1 Asymptotics at large f\n4.1.1 Density cores: limited phase-space densities\nLet us consider the (non-singular) isothermal sphere (e.g. Binney &\nTremaine 1987). I have obtained numerically the potential \u0004(r ) as\nwell as the phase-space volume g(E) at constant energy. The volume\ndistribution function is then given by g(E)\/|dF\/dE | and D(f ) can\nbe computed using equation (13). The result is plotted in Fig. 3. The\nmass of the isothermal sphere is infinite and hence D \u2192 \u221e as f \u2192\n0. The maximum phase-space density is f max = 2\u03c1 0\/[9(2\u03c0\u03c3 )3\/2],\nwhere \u03c3 and \u03c1 0 denote the velocity dispersion and central density,\nrespectively. At f \u2248 f max, the excess-mass function decays as D \u221d\n( f max \u2212 f )4.\nFigure 3.

The dimensionless and continuous\nfunction \u000b(x\u02c6) determines the shape of surfaces of equal density. I\nproceed by assuming that the distribution function is of the form\n\u00afF = \u03c10v\u221230 h(X) \u02dcf (E) (30)\nwith the constant v0 being as given in equation (A2). Here E =\nv2\/2 + \u0004(x) is the energy, while X = X(x, v) denotes a set of\nscale-invariant integrals of motion. Scale invariance in this case\nmeans that\nX(x,v) = X(ax, a1\u2212\u03b3 \/2v) (31)\nfor any dimensionless scalefactor a. Examples for scale-invariant\nproperties of stellar orbits are the eccentricity and ratios between or-\nbital frequencies or actions. After some algebra (see the Appendix),\nthe excess-mass function is found to be\nD( f ) = D\u03b3 h r 3u \u03c10\n( f 2 G3\u03c10r 6u )\u2212 3\u2212\u03b36\u2212\u03b3 , (32)\nwhere D\u03b3 h is a dimensionless constant given in equation (A13),\nwhich for the spherical (\u000b \u2261 1) and isotropic (h \u2261 1) case reduces\nto a simple expression (see the Appendix).\nThe exponent in D \u221d f \u22122(3\u2212\u03b3 )\/(6\u2212\u03b3 ) varies only between 1 for\n\u03b3 \u2192 0 and 0 for \u03b3 \u2192 3 and decreases with increasing \u03b3 , i.e.\na steeper cusp is less mixed than a shallower one. Moreover, this\nasymptotic behaviour of D(f ) depends only on the cusp strength and\nnot on the details of the density contours or the distribution function,\nas long as it is scale-invariant.\nFor a non-self-gravitating system with density \u221d r\u2212\u03b3 immersed\nin a gravitational field generated by an overall mass density \u03c1 \u221d r\u2212\u03b2\nwith \u03b2 \u0002 \u03b3 , one finds by a similar analysis\nD \u221d f \u22122(3\u2212\u03b3 )\/(6+2\u03b3\u22123\u03b2). (33)\n4.1.3 Stellar systems dominated by a supermassive black hole\nThe case of a stellar system where the dynamics is dominated by a\nsupermassive black hole corresponds to \u03b2 = 3 in equation (33), i.e.\ngives D \u221d f \u22122(3\u2212\u03b3 )\/(2\u03b3\u22123). Note that the phase-space density of such\na system is unlimited only for \u03b3 > 32 . The exponents in this relation\nvary between \u221e for \u03b3 \u2192 32 and 0 for \u03b3 \u2192 3. Thus, again steeper\ncusps are less mixed, but the differences are much more emphasized\nthan for self-consistent cusps.\n4.2 Asymptotics at small f\nNext, consider a stellar system of finite mass. For simplicity, I con-\nsider the case of spherical density only. The potential in the outer\nparts is dominated by the monopole, i.e. \u0004 = \u2212GM\/r , while the\ndensity is assumed to be of the form \u03c1 = \u03c1 0(r\/r u)\u2212\u03b7 with \u03b7 > 3\n5 For any real system, the resolution is of course finite and hence, density\nlimited. However, we assume here that the resolution is high enough for the\nasymptotic limit to be useful over a range of densities.\nfor the mass not to diverge at r \u2192 \u221e. A distribution function of the\nform \u00afF \u221d L\u22122\u03b2 \u02dcf (E) always generates a constant Binney anisotropy\n\u03b2 \u2261 1 \u2212 \u03c3 2\u03b8 \/\u03c3 2r (Cuddeford 1991). For the case considered here,\nthis gives\n\u00afF = \u03c10 (G M\/ru)\u22123\/2 f\u03b7\u03b2 X\u2212\u03b2E\u03b7\u22123\/2, (34)\nwhere E = \u2212ru E\/G M, X \u2261 L2\/L2circ(E) = 1 \u2212 \u000f2 (orbital cir-\ncularity) and f \u22121\u03b7\u03b2 = 23\/2\u03c0B( 12 , 1 \u2212 \u03b2)B( 32 \u2212 \u03b2, \u03b7 \u2212 12 \u2212 \u03b2). The\nphase-space volume at fixed (E , X )\ng(E, X ) =\n\u221a\n2G Mr 5u \u03c03E\u22125\/2 (35)\nis independent of X. From these, one can obtain v(f ) and\nD( f ) = MD \u2212 \u03c10r 3u D\u03b7\u03b2\n( f 2G3 M3\nr 3u \u03c1\n2\n0\n)(\u03b7\u22123)\/(2\u03b7\u22123)\n(36)\nwhere M D \u0003 M is the total mass of the density component consid-\nered and\nD\u03b7\u03b2 = 2\n1\/2 \u03c03(2\u03b7 \u2212 3)2\n3(\u03b7 \u2212 3)(2\u03b7 \u2212 3 \u2212 3\u03b2) f\n3\/(2\u03b7\u22123)\n\u03b7\u03b2 . (37)\nHence, again the asymptotic is independent of details such as the\norbital anisotropy.\n4.3 Excess-mass functions of the \u03b3 models\nFig. 4 shows the excess-mass function of the spherical \u03b3 -models\n(Dehnen 1993; Tremaine et al. 1994, with M and a denoting the\ntotal mass and the scale radius)\n\u03c1 = 3 \u2212 \u03b3\n2\u03c0\nMa\nr \u03b3 (r + a)4\u2212\u03b3 (38)\nFigure 4.

The line\nshows the asymptotic slope predicted by equation (36).\n5 A P P L I C AT I O N : M E R G I N G C U S P S\nAs an application, consider the merging of several cusped galaxies\nor dark matter haloes. Because of its additivity the combined D(f )\nprior to the merger is equal to the sum of those of the progenitors.\nWhen equilibrium has been re-established after the merger, D r( f )\nof the merger remnant must satisfy\nDr( f ) \u0003 D\u0010( f ) \u2261\n\u2211\ni\nDi ( f ). (39)\n5.1 Constraints on the cusp strength\nLet us first consider the combined excess-mass function of the pro-\ngenitors on the right-hand side of (39). Each Di( f ) is of the form\n(32): Di \u221d f \u22122(3\u2212\u03b3i )\/(6\u2212\u03b3i ). Thus, at sufficiently large phase-space\ndensities D\u0010 will be dominated by the steepest progenitor cusp.\nNext, suppose the remnant also forms a scale-free cusp, such that\nits excess-mass function Dr \u221d f \u22122(3\u2212\u03b3r)\/(6\u2212\u03b3r). Then for condition\n(39) to be satisfied \u03b3 r \u0003 maxi{\u03b3 i}. Thus, the remnant cusp cannot\nbe steeper than any of the progenitor cusps.\nIn other words, steeper cusps are less mixed than shallower cusps\n(in the limit f \u2192 \u221e) regardless of details such as the shape of\nthe density contours or the distribution of orbital shapes (orbital\nanisotropy), as long as these are the same for all radii and\/or en-\nergies (scale freedom). This implies that by virtue of the mixing\ntheorem mergers cannot produce cusps steeper than those already\npresent in their progenitors. Conversely, a remnant cusp shallower\nthan the steepest of its progenitors would require an arbitrarily large\ndilution \u03b1 of the distribution function as f \u2192 \u221e. This, while not\nimpossible, seems highly implausible, which strongly suggests that\nthe remnant cusp should not be shallower than the steepest of its\nprogenitors. Together with the above mixing constraint, this means\nthat the maximum cusp strength is conserved when merging colli-\nsionless stellar systems.\n5.2 Constraints on the cusp mass\nLet me exemplify the merging of two equal and cusped galaxies a\nlittle more. I assume that the remnant has the same scale-invariant\nstructure and cusp strength \u03b3 as its progenitors, but a different den-\nsity normalization, \u03c1 0r \b= \u03c1 0p. Under these circumstances, the dilu-\ntion function \u03b1( f ) of equation (28) is constant (in the asymptotic\nlimit considered). Together with equation (32) and the additivity,\nthis yields\n\u03c10r = \u03c10p 2\u2212(6\u2212\u03b3 )\/3 (1 + \u03b1)\u22123\/[2(3\u2212\u03b3 )]. (40)\nThus, for \u03c1 0r = 2\u03c1 0p (i.e. the remnant cusp containing the sum of\nthe progenitor-cusp masses), the dilution fraction has to be \u03b1 =\u221a\n2 \u2212 1 \u2248 41 per cent independent of \u03b3 . For the remnant cusp to\nbe equally massive as either of its progenitors, \u03b1 = 2(6\u2212\u03b3 )\/2(3\u2212\u03b3 ) \u2212\n1, which evaluates to 1 for \u03b3 = 0, to \u2248138 per cent for \u03b3 = 1,\nto \u2248183 per cent for \u03b3 = 1.5 and 3 for \u03b3 = 2. Thus, if \u03b1 is not\nstrongly dependent on \u03b3 , relation (40) suggests that remnants of\nsteep-cusp mergers have more massive cusps, compared with their\nprogenitors, than remnants of shallow-cusp mergers. However, since\nsteeper cusps generate stronger tides, one would indeed expect \u03b1 to\ndepend on \u03b3 in a sense opposing the above trend.\n6 A P P L I C AT I O N TO N - B O DY S I M U L AT I O N S\nOne of the motivations of this study was the hope to use the excess-\nmass function as a diagnostic tool in the interpretation and validation\nof N-body experiments.

Arad, Dekel & Klypin (2004) and\nAscasibar & Binney (2005) have demonstrated in two pioneering\nstudies that this can be done in principle, even though it is a difficult\ntask, because of (i) the vastness of 6D phase space and (ii) the lack\nof a metric.\nOnce estimates \u02c6\u00afFi for \u00afF at the phase-space positions of the bodies\nhave been obtained, the excess-mass function may be estimated as\n\u02c6D( f ) =\n\u2211\n\u02c6\u00afFi > f\nmi \u2212 f\n\u2211\n\u02c6\u00afFi > f\nmi\n\u02c6\u00afFi\n, (41)\nwhere mi denotes the mass of the ith body. A serious problem in\nthis game is that the coarse-graining scale used in the estimation of\n\u00afF may well be larger than the scales still resolved by the system.\nAs discussed in Section 3, this approximation error may result in\nunwanted surprises (such as \u02c6D increasing with time).\nFig. 5 demonstrates these problems when applying the phase-\nspace density estimator FIESTAS of Ascasibar & Binney (2005) to\n106 points drawn from a Hernquist (1990) sphere. The top two pan-\nels show that the estimated density can be incorrect by up to two\norders of magnitude and is systematically too large for f \u0005 0.01,\nwhile high densities are truncated, in particular when smoothing is\nFigure 5.

Middle: the same, but using\nFIESTAS without smoothing.

The bottom panel shows the estimate \u02c6D( f ) ob-\ntained from equation (41) and the FIESTAS estimated densities with\n(short-dashed) and without (long-dashed) smoothing. A compari-\nson with the true D(f ) (solid) shows that the estimated D(f ) is only\nslightly too large at intermediate f , but is seriously in error at large f\n(and also at very small f ), in particular when smoothing was used.\nThese errors are obviously related to the underestimation of large\nphase-space densities. This underestimation occurs at values for \u00afF\nbelow those expected from the finite resolution with N = 106, since\nM( f )\/M tot = 10\u22126 at f \u2248 104.7 and 10\u22125 at f \u2248 103.5.\nAlso plotted are the estimates from equation (41) using the true\nfine-grained phase-space densities of 106 bodies (dotted). These can\nhardly be distinguished from the true D(f ), indicating that equation\n(41) gives a fairly good estimator provided the estimates \u02c6\u00afFi are\ngood.\nThese results suggest that, in order to resolve the asymptotic be-\nhaviour of D(f ) at f \u2192 \u221e, at least \u223c107 points are required with\nthis technique. Clearly, there must be ways to improve the situation.\nApart from improvements in the existing technique, one may exploit\nthe fact that dt \u00afF = 0 (assuming no mixing is going on) in order to\nconstrain the possible values for \u02c6\u00afFi .\n7 S U M M A RY A N D C O N C L U S I O N\nA stellar system out of equilibrium is driven towards equilibrium by\nway of mixing its phase-space densities in a process of violent re-\nlaxation. Consequently, the concept of the fine-grained distribution\nfunction F(x, v) is ill-suited to understanding non-equilibrium stel-\nlar dynamics. Instead, the system is better described in terms of its\ncoarse-grained distribution function \u00afF(x,v). Mixing of phase-space\nelements changes \u00afF in such a way that the excess-mass function\nD( f ) \u2261\n\u222b\n\u00afF(x,v)> f\n[ \u00afF(x,v) \u2212 f ] d3x d3v\ndecreases (mixing lemma, Section 2.2), equivalent to a statement by\nMathur (1988). In fact, only events which mix densities > f with\ndensities < f decrease D(f ). This lemma may be considered an ex-\ntension of the well-known maximum phase-space density argument\nto all density values. D(f ) measures the excess mass due to phase-\nspace densities higher than f and its decrease is directly related to\nentropy increase, see equation (21). A useful property of D(f ) is its\nadditivity: the excess-mass function of the combination of disjoint\nstellar systems (which do not overlap in phase space) is simply the\nsum of the individual D(f ).\nIn Section 2.4, I prove a novel form of the mixing theorem\n(Tremaine et al. 1986), stating that D(f ) decreases if and only if\nany H-functional of the distribution function increases. My lemma\ntogether with this theorem is an alternative proof of the H theorem\n(increasing H-functionals due to mixing), avoiding some conceptual\nproblems associated with allowing arbitrary coarse-graining.\nIn Section 3, the importance of details of the coarse-graining op-\nerator for the validity of the H theorem are discussed. It is argued\nthat the conceptual problems of Tremaine et al.\u2019s proof of this the-\norem can be avoided by requiring appropriate coarse-graining. In\nparticular, I propose an interpretation of the coarse-grained distribu-\ntion function \u00afF as the best possible description of the stellar system.\nIn this interpretation, the astrophysical process of mixing is directly\ndescribed by coarse-graining and in the absence of mixing dt \u00afF = 0,\nsuch that the H theorem is guaranteed.\nIn Section 4, D(f ) for some simple spherical equilibria is given\nand its asymptotic behaviour at small and large f considered. For\nequilibria with a self-gravitating scale-invariant density cusp (\u03c1 \u221d\nr\u2212\u03b3 ), the asymptotic behaviour at f \u2192 \u221e is D \u221d f \u22122(3\u2212\u03b3 )\/(6\u2212\u03b3 )\nindependent of the shape of the density contours and details of the\ndistribution function. This remarkable property together with the\nadditivity and the mixing theorem allowed me in Section 5 to prove\nthat a merger remnant cannot have a density cusp steeper than any\nof its progenitors. Assuming that mixing during the merger does\nnot become ever stronger at higher values of \u00afF (which cannot be\nstrictly excluded, but appears highly implausible), one can show that\nthe maximum cusp strength is conserved, i.e. the remnant cusp has\nstrength \u03b3 equal to the maximum of its progenitors.\nClearly, the decreasing nature of the excess-mass function is not\nrestricted to galactic dynamics, but applicable to any collisionless\nsystem undergoing mixing. For instance, the inequality constraint\nused by Yu & Tremaine (2002, equation 33) to describe the evo-\nlution of the population of supermassive black holes is essentially\nequivalent to the mixing lemma. In this case, merging of supermas-\nsive black holes mixes the distribution of their properties.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nTheoretical Astrophysics at Leicester is supported by a PPARC\nrolling grant.
