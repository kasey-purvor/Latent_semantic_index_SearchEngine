Does this hold true for food aid as well? This article \nanalyses the allocation of food aid in the 1990s by the world\u2019s three biggest donors as \nwell as non-governmental organisations (NGOs). It finds some evidence for donor \ninterest bias, particularly in the form of preferential treatment of geographically close \ncountries. However, neither military-strategic nor export interests seem to matter. \nFormer Western colonies are also not treated differently. Instead, particularly \nEuropean Union, multilateral and NGO food aid allocation appears quite sensitive \ntowards recipient countries\u2019 needs. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nThere is by now a long list of studies examining the allocation of general aid (see \nNeumayer [2003a] for an overview). In comparison, the allocation of food aid has been \nsomewhat neglected. Partly this might be due to the fact that it represents only a small \nshare of overall official development assistance (ODA), namely around 3 per cent in \n1998, down from 22 per cent in 1965 [Webb, 2000]. The peculiarities of food aid make \nan analysis of its allocation across countries worth while, however. \nThe literature analysing the allocation of general aid across recipient countries in \nthe wake of McKinlay and Little [1977] distinguishes between two main groups of \ndeterminants: donor interest and recipient need. Food aid is likely to be seen by the \ngeneral public as more humanitarian in nature and more oriented towards recipient need \nthan general ODA. We want to test whether donor interest impacts upon the allocation \nof food aid across countries and therefore distorts an allocation based on recipient need \nonly. \n2 \nThe Food Aid Convention (FAC), which provides guidance for international food \naid allocation, stresses that donors should give priority to recipient need (Art. I (b), Art. \nVII (c) and Art. VIII (b) of the FAC in its form of 1999). The perception of a \nhumanitarian nature of food aid is particularly true for emergency food aid deliveries. \nTelevision pictures of donors handing out food aid to undernourished suffering men, \nwomen and children in developing countries dominate the public perception. For this \nreason, one might expect emergency food aid to be particularly strongly determined by \nrecipient need. On the other hand, some observes such as Clay [2002: 204] believe that \nemergency aid is \u2018intrinsically political\u2019, which would imply that, instead, it might be \nparticularly subject to donor interest. We therefore want to test whether the allocation of \ntotal food aid and emergency food aid in particular is free from donor interest bias. The \nshare of emergency food among total food aid rose in the 1990s to a peak of 40 per cent \nin 1997 [Webb, 2000]. This development came mainly at the expense of a reduced share \nof programme food aid [Clay and Stokke, 2000]. Emergency aid consists of food to \nvictims of natural and man-made disasters such as earthquakes, floods, famines, \nmilitary conflict and the like. Programme aid is often provided to the recipient \ngovernment or its agents where the food is sold on local markets. Yet another category, \nproject aid, is provided to targeted groups for the support of specific development \nprojects. \nDonors differ in the emphasis they put on donor interest versus recipient need, at \nleast in their official proclamations. Historically, justification for United States (US) \nfood aid has officially embraced US domestic agricultural and foreign policy interests. \nFor example, the 1954 legislation establishing US food aid listed the development of \nexport markets, the containment of communism and the reward to loyal allies as \nobjectives of food aid in addition to humanitarian concerns [Diven, 2001: 456]. \n3 \nHowever, later legislation in 1974 tried to strengthen recipient need as the major \ncriterion for US food aid allocation [Zahariadis et al., 2000: 667]. In comparison, \nrecipient need has been stressed as the main priority by the European Union (EU) for its \nfood aid from the start [Cathie, 1997]. Art. 2 of the 1986 regulation as well as Art. 1 of \nthe 1996 regulation on Food-aid Policy and Food-aid Management state as objectives of \nEU food aid the promotion of food security, raising the standard of nutrition, help in \nemergencies and the support of self-sufficiency in food production (OJ L 370\/1 1986; \nOJ L 166 1996). Art. 2 of both regulations also stress that \u2018food aid shall primarily be \nallocated on the basis of an objective evaluation of the real needs\u2019 of recipient countries. \nIn our test of whether donor interest biases the allocation of food aid across \ncountries, we will focus on the 1990s as one would expect that the end of the Cold War \nopened the way for providing food aid to those really in need instead of those in which \ndonors have economic, political and military-strategic interests. We will concentrate \nhere on aid from the US, EU food aid allocated by the European Commission (EC), the \nUnited Nations\u2019 World Food Programme (WFP) and non-governmental organisations \n(NGOs).1 Table 1 shows that the first three are the world\u2019s largest food aid donors. \nNGO food aid represents a relatively small share of world food aid, but it has not been \nanalysed before and we want to see whether it is free from any donor interest bias as \none might expect given the humanitarian mission of practically all NGOs. \n \n< Insert Table 1 about here > \n \nWe are not addressing the issue of what determines the overall supply of food aid \nby donors. Minimum annual obligations are set by the regularly revised FAC, but \nanything going beyond that is subject to the discretion of the donor. Many studies show \n4 \nthat the overall supply is heavily influenced by domestic agricultural surpluses in donor \ncountries and world prices for cereals [Gilbert, 1996; Barrett, 1998; Webb, 2000; Diven, \n2001]. We are merely interested in the allocation of aid across countries and control for \ntemporary changes in the total supply of food by year-specific time dummy variables. \nThe effectiveness of food aid in terms of agricultural development is also highly \ncontested [Ruttan, 1993; Barrett, 1998]. This is in accordance with recent analyses \ndoubting the effectiveness of general ODA, unless it is targeted to countries with good \ngovernance [World Bank, 1998]. A separate, but related, debate is on whether aid for \naddressing food shortages should be delivered in the form of actual food or should \nconsist of financial aid for the alleviation of hunger and poverty [Reutlinger, 1999]. We \nwill not engage with these discussions. Again, we are merely interested in the \ndeterminants of food aid allocation here, not in its effectiveness or best way of delivery. \n \nII. REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES \nMost empirical studies have focused on US food aid allocation. Eggleston [1987] finds \nthat food aid allocation over the period 1955 to 1979 is influenced by both recipient \nneed and US political and military interests. Shapouri and Missiaen [1990] similarly \nfind for the years 1975 and 1985 that both recipient need, friendly political ideology and \neconomic export interests impact upon US food aid allocation. Other than that, they find \nno major change between the two time periods. Ball and Johnson [1996] disentangle \nfood aid and examine whether the allocation of different components of US food aid \nacross African recipient countries have been driven by different determinants. In \nparticular, they look at Title I aid, which is most explicitly tied to donor interest in the \nunderlying legislation and which provides concessional credit to developing countries \nfor the purchase of food, and Title II aid, which is more explicitly humanitarian and \n5 \noften provided through the WFP. In addition, they also examine whether the \ndeterminants changed over time from the 1970s to the 1980s. Over the period as a \nwhole and for all US food aid taken together as well as Title I aid, donor interest in the \nform of arms exports and voting similarity at the United Nations is found to be the most \nimportant determinant. For Title II aid, however, the donor interest variables are \nstatistically insignificant and recipient need is more important than for total food aid. \nLooked at over time, Ball and Johnson [1996] find that donor interest has become less \nimportant in the 1980s compared to the 1970s, whereas the opposite is the case for \nrecipient need. They explain this with \u2018the waning influence of the Cold War\u2019 [Ball and \nJohnson, 1996: 530], which they argue took effect from the mid-1980s onwards, that is \nlong before the fall of the Berlin Wall. \nZahariadis et al. [2000] are the first to distinguish between two stages of US food \naid allocation in their analysis of Title I and Title II food aid to Sub-Saharan African \ncountries over the period 1978 to 1990. The general aid allocation literature had made \nthis distinction much earlier already [Dudley and Montmarquette, 1976; Cingranelli and \nPasquarello, 1985]. In the first stage, sometimes called gate-keeping stage, countries are \nselected as eligible or not for aid. In the second or level stage, it is determined how \nmuch aid goes to eligible countries. Zahariadis et al. [2000] find that donor interest in \nthe form of US security concerns and trade interests plays a role in the selection of \ncountries as eligible for Title I aid in addition to recipient need. In contrast, donor \ninterest plays no role for the amount of Title II food aid allocated to eligible countries.2  \nWith respect to donors other than the US, Shapouri and Missiaen [1990] find that \ndonor interest, particularly in the form of trade interests, is also a statistically significant \ndeterminant of Canadian and EU food aid allocation besides recipient need. Herrmann \net al. [1992] confirm the importance of recipient need for EU food aid allocation over \n6 \nthe years 1983 to 1985. This result needs to be treated with care, however, since they do \nnot control for donor interest. The same is true for a background paper to a Joint \nEvaluation of European Union Programme Food Aid undertaken by the Overseas \nDevelopment Institute. Contrary to Herrmann et al. [1992], it found less evidence for \nthe impact of recipient need on EU food aid allocation as there is \u2018only a weak \nrelationship between actual food aid allocations and variables approximating closely to \nindicators stated by donors as influencing their allocations. Allocations do not reflect \ndirect and simple targeting according to indicators such as per capita income or balance-\nof-payments problems and food availability in recipient countries\u2019 [ODI 1996, para. \n2.5.2]. Note, however, that the latter study only examined programme food aid, whereas \nHerrmann et al. [1992] look at total food aid. \nAt the aggregate level, the general aid allocation literature usually finds multilateral \naid to be more sensitive to recipient need and less sensitive to donor interest than \nbilateral aid [Neumayer, 2003a, 2003b]. For food aid as well, there is \u2018a widespread \nbelief that multilateral assistance is more effective in reaching intended beneficiaries \n(\u2026) because it is allocated more according to recipients\u2019 needs than donors\u2019 needs\u2019 \n[Barrett and Heisey, 2002: 479]. Note that unlike general ODA, where there is a \nmultitude of multilateral donors, almost all multilateral food aid is channelled through \nthe WFP. The mission statement of the WFP postulates that it \u2018will concentrate its \nefforts and resources on the neediest people and countries\u2019 [WFP, 2003]. Surprisingly, \nhowever, there is only weak and somewhat ambiguous evidence that multilateral food \naid allocation is actually more sensitive to recipient need. \nShapouri and Missiaen [1990] find multilateral aid to be more responsive to \nrecipient need in 1985 than in 1975. This result needs to be treated with care, however, \nas it derives from a model, in which recipient need variables are the only explanatory \n7 \nvariables included and donor interest is missing. A couple of other studies suffer from \nthe same problem. Barrett [2001] does not directly analyse the determinants of food aid \nallocation, but he examines whether US food aid over the period 1961 to 1995 goes to \ncountries with lower food availability (progressivity) and whether it stabilises short-falls \nin trend line food production over time (stabilisation). He finds neither to be the case, \nindependently of whether total food aid or the components of it are looked at. Barrett \nand Heisey [2002] repeat the analysis for WFP aid over the period 1975 to 1998, \nfinding evidence for both progressivity and stabilisation.3 This result is somewhat at \nodds with a study undertaken by Gabbert and Weikard [2000]. They use a complex \nformula for measuring under-nourishment as an indicator of recipient need, which is \ncriticised by Barrett and Heisey [2002: 489] as being based on \u2018inherently arbitrary \nassumptions about intranational food distribution\u2019. Gabbert and Weikard [2000] find \nthat Canadian and EU food aid over the period 1990 to 1996 is more targeted at \nrecipient need than US or WFP aid. Japan is somewhat ambiguous as its project aid is \nstrongly targeted at recipient need, whereas the opposite is true for its emergency aid. \nEmergency food aid is more targeted at recipient need than programme or project aid \nwith the exception of Japan. Interesting though these results are, the failure to include \ndonor interest variables means that nothing can be inferred about these and, more \nimportantly, that the results could suffer from omitted variable bias if the examined \nrecipient need variables are correlated with the omitted donor interest variables. A \nrecent study by McGillivray [2003] stresses the importance of including both recipient \nneed and donor interest variables in aid allocation models and highlights the bias in \nregression results following from a failure to do so for the case of US general ODA \nallocation. \n8 \nBarrett and Heisey [2002: 489] explain their result that WFP food aid is both \nprogressive and stabilising by saying that it \u2018reflects the fact that where bilateral donors \ndistribute food aid for multiple motives related to export promotion, farm surplus \ndisposal, and geopolitical interests, with food security in recipient countries a decidedly \nless prominent concern, the WFP is designed to focus on the latter concern as much as \npossible\u2019. However, one would want to test for the irrelevance of donor interest in WFP \naid allocation as opposed to bilateral allocation, rather than assume it. Such a test is \nundertaken here. This is the first study to analyse comprehensively food aid flows in the \n1990s from the major donors explicitly testing whether the allocation of food aid is free \nfrom donor interest bias. \n \nIII. RESEARCH DESIGN \nDependent variables \nThe correct accounting of what amounts to food aid is not without problems [Clay and \nStokke 2000: 21]. Food aid can consist of food being delivered or of financial assistance \nprovided that is tied to the purchase of food by the recipient (\u2018aid for food\u2019). In this \nanalysis, food aid means the delivery of food and is measured in tons of wheat \nequivalent. This is the only definition of food aid that can be analysed as no \ncomprehensive data exist on financial aid flows for the purpose of food purchasing (\u2018aid \nfor food\u2019). We look at total food aid as well as one of its sub-categories, namely \nemergency aid. As mentioned above, there are arguments why emergency aid might be \nmore or less biased towards donor interest than total food aid. The data come from the \nso-called INTERFAIS database and have been provided courtesy of the WFP. Note that \nin our analysis that part of US food aid, which comes under Title II of Public Law 480 \nand is channelled to recipient countries via the WFP, is counted as WFP rather than US \n9 \nfood aid as it is the ultimate responsibility of the WFP to allocate these resources. Food \naid under Title I and Title III is counted as US food aid as it is not channelled to \nrecipient countries via the WFP. \nThe general aid allocation literature disagrees on whether total ODA should be the \ndependent variable or ODA per capita. The latter elegantly controls for the fact that \nrecipient countries differ tremendously in their population sizes. If total ODA is taken to \nbe the dependent variable, then at the least population size must be one of the \nexplanatory variables to account for the fact that, all other things equal, very populous \ncountries are likely to receive more aid than very small ones. Which variable to choose \nshould be the result of a careful consideration of the way donors are likely to allocate \naid and should approximate their actual decision-making behaviour best. In most cases, \nit seems reasonable to presume that there is an overall fixed amount of (food) aid to be \nallocated. Given this overall constraint, McGillivray and Oczkowski [1992: 1314] are \ncorrect in arguing that \u2018distributing aid in per capita terms in this context is both a \ndifficult and cumbersome task\u2019 as care needs to be taken neither to overshoot nor \nundershoot the fixed overall amount of money available. It is much easier for donors to \nallocate a share of the total amount of aid available to each recipient country. As \nMcGillivray and Oczkowski [ibid.] point out, in this process of dividing the cake \u2018aid \ndecision makers may well be aware of the corresponding per capita amounts, and may \nwell adjust absolute amounts on this basis, but this is taken to represent a response to \ncountry size. In this context, per capita aid allocations are viewed as the outcome of this \nprocess rather than the prime consideration.\u2019 We therefore take the amount of food aid \nprovided to a recipient country to be the dependent variable and include population size \nas a control variable (data from World Bank [2001]]. We believe that this variable \napproximates best the way donors undertake their aid allocation decisions. \n10 \n \nIndependent variables \nThe single most common and frequently only variable of recipient need included in \nstudies of general aid allocation is a country\u2019s level of income. GDP per capita data in \npurchasing power parity were generally taken from World Bank [2001] and \ncomplemented by WHO [2000]. They were converted into constant US$ of 1997 with \nthe help of the US GDP deflator. In addition, we include a number of variables \ncapturing more specifically food aid need. The average daily per capita calorie supply in \nthousand calories is taken from UN [1997] and supplemented by FAO [2003]. An index \nof self-sufficiency is constructed from data in FAO [2003] and is defined as domestic \ncereal production divided by the sum of domestic cereal production, commercial \nimports and stock changes. Particularly for emergency aid, natural and man-made \ndisasters and complex emergencies trigger a need in affected countries for food \nassistance. As one measure we include the total number of refugees in tens of thousands \nbeing hosted by a country with data taken from UNHCR [2002]. \nWe will use a whole range of variables commonly used in the general aid \nallocation literature that cover different aspects of donor interest. First, we use a \nvariable measuring the number of years a recipient country has been a colony of the \ndonor between 1900 and 1960 (data from Alesina and Dollar [2000]). Former colonial \npowers usually have remaining political, economic, cultural and other interests in their \nformer colonies. This variable was not included in the case of US aid allocation as the \nPhilippines are the only former US colony in the sample. For aid allocation by the EU \nthe variable refers to being a former colony of any EU member country. In the case of \nWFP and NGO aid, the variable counts the number of years a country has been the \ncolony of any Western country. The second variable is the geographical distance \n11 \nbetween the donor and the recipient country\u2019s capital [Haveman, 2000]. Donors often \ntend to give more aid to geographically close countries in order to maintain a regional \nsphere of influence. In the case of EU aid allocation, this variable measures the distance \nto Brussels. For WFP and NGO aid, it measures the distance to either Washington D.C. \nor Brussels, whichever is smaller. Third, to see whether donors give preference to \ncountries, in which they have a military-strategic interest, we include a variable \nmeasuring the share of United States military grants to this country (data from USAID \n[2002]). The idea behind using this variable is that countries that receive high United \nStates military grants can be regarded as allied to Western donors and strategically \nimportant countries. Ideally, we would have liked to include similar information from \nother Western countries as well, but no sufficient data exist. Fourth, we use a variable \nmeasuring the amount of food exported from the donor to the recipient country as a \nshare of total donor food exports (data from OECD [2002]). This variable functions as a \nproxy for the commercial food or trade interest of donors. Fifth, since we expect that it \nis in donors\u2019 interest to give aid to \u201cfriendly\u201d and \u201cclose\u201d countries, we employ two \nvariables trying to approximate this interest. As a proxy for converging political \nviewpoints we use a political similarity variable that draws from voting behaviour in the \nUN General Assembly (data from Gartzke, Jo and Tucker [1999]). With respect to the \nlast two variables, for WFP and NGO aid we use a weighted average between the US \nand the European value. The weighting is two thirds for the US and one third for the \nEuropean value, which approximately reflects the relative size of commitment of the US \nand the EU countries according to the Food Aid Convention. Lastly, as a proxy for \ncultural similarity we use the percentage of Protestant and Catholic people living in a \nrecipient country (data from Parker [1997]). \n12 \nAs a simple test for potential problems with multicollinearity among the \nexplanatory variables, variance inflation factors were computed, which are well below \nthree for all variables suggesting that there is no reason to be concerned about \nmulticollinearity [Kennedy, 1992]. \n \nEstimation strategy \nLike Zahariadis et al. [2000] and much of the general aid allocation literature, we \ndistinguish between two stages, a first eligibility or gate-keeping stage and a second \nstage, in which the amount of aid going to eligible countries is determined. There are \nbasically two ways to estimate such a model. One is to follow the lead of Dudley and \nMontmarquette [1976] and many others and to treat the two stages as independent (so-\ncalled two-part model). One of the problems with this two-part model is that it assumes \nthat the errors in both stages are uncorrelated. In other words, it assumes that decisions \nat the gate-keeping stage are taken independently from the decisions at the level stage, \nwhich might be unrealistic. \nThe second method is Heckman\u2019s [1979] two-step estimator, which explicitly \nallows the error terms from both stages of aid allocation to be correlated. It has been \nused by, for example, McGillivray and Oczkowski [1992] in the aid allocation \nliterature. One of the disadvantage of the two-step estimator is that it requires an \nexclusionary variable that has a significant impact upon the first step (gate-keeping \nstage), but not upon the second step (level stage).4 Such a variable is commonly difficult \nto find. For this reason we use the two-part model for our estimations. In non-reported \nsensitivity analysis employing Heckman\u2019s two-step estimator without an exclusionary \nvariable we found very little difference to the results reported here. We estimate the first \nstage with probit and standard errors that are robust towards arbitrary heteroscedasticity \n13 \nand serial correlation. The second stage is estimated with a generalised estimating \nequations (GEE) random effects estimator with standard errors that in addition to \nrobustness towards heteroscedasticity and serial correlation also allow observations to \nbe independent across, but not necessarily within, countries (clustering). In both stages \nwe also included year-specific time dummies to account for temporal changes in the \noverall amount of food aid provided. \nThe explanatory variables enter the regressions with a one year lag to mimic the \nstate of information that allocators of food aid have at the time of decision-making. \nLagging these variables also fulfils the purpose of mitigating any potential simultaneity \nbias given that the amount of food aid impacts upon the calorie supply and the food \nself-sufficiency of a country. With respect to the variables measuring need for food aid, \none could argue that due to the existence of the Global Information and Early Warning \nSystem on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS), established in 1975 at the request of the \n1974 World Food Conference, decision makers have access to more current data. The \nsame is true for national alert systems such as the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment\u2019s Famine Early Warning System (FEWS). However, in non-reported \nsensitivity analysis we found very little difference to the results reported below if we let \nthe food recipient need variables enter the regressions without a lag. \nThe sample covers the period 1990 to 1999 and in principle contains all developing \ncountries and countries in transition for which data on the explanatory variables are \navailable (141 in total). The dependent variable is logged in order to make its \ndistribution less skewed. This also improved the model fit substantially. The population \nsize, income and geographical distance explanatory variables are logged for the same \nreason. Note, however, that the results reported below are little affected if, instead, these \nvariables were not logged. \n14 \n \nIV. RESULTS \nWe start with the US, the biggest food aid donor, for which estimation results are shown \nin table 2. At the gate-keeping stage, more populous countries as well as those with a \nlower per capita calorie supply are more likely to receive either total or emergency food \naid. Poorer countries also have a higher chance of being eligible for total food aid. \nContrary to expectation, countries hosting a greater number of refugees are less likely to \nreceive total food aid. For both categories of aid, geographical proximity renders \ncountries more likely to be eligible for aid. Countries with voting similarity in the UN \ngeneral assembly are more likely to receive total food aid. Other biases towards donor \ninterests are not apparent. With respect to the level stage, more populous, more food \nimport dependent and geographically closer eligible countries receive a higher amount \nof total food aid. Neither population size, nor any of the recipient need or donor interest \nvariables test statistically significantly for emergency food aid, however. \n \n< Insert Table 2 about here > \n \nEstimation results for the EU are presented in table 3. More populous, poorer, more \nfood import dependent countries as well as those with a lower per capita calorie supply \nare more likely to receive both total and emergency food aid. Countries hosting a higher \nnumber of refugees are more likely to receive emergency food aid, but not total food \naid. Geographical proximity renders countries more likely to receive either total or \nemergency food aid, countries with a higher share of Protestants and Catholics are also \nmore likely to receive total food aid. No other donor interest bias is apparent at the gate-\nkeeping stage. At the level stage, more populous and more food import dependent \n15 \ncountries as well as those with a lower per capita calorie supply receive more total and \nemergency aid. The same is true for geographically closer countries. In addition, \ncountries with voting similarity in the UN general assembly receive more emergency, \nbut not more total food aid. No other donor interest bias is suggested by the estimation \nresults. \n \n< Insert Table 3 about here > \n \nThe WFP\u2019s food aid allocation is the dependent variable in the estimation results of \ntable 4. More populous and poorer countries as well as those with a lower per capita \ncalorie supply and those hosting more refugees are more likely to be eligible for total \nand emergency food aid. In addition, more food import dependent countries are more \nlikely to receive total food aid. Donor interest does not bias the aid eligibility selection \nof emergency aid, but perhaps surprisingly countries with a higher share of Protestants \nand Catholics as well as those geographically closer to the US or Western Europe are \nmore likely to receive total food aid. At the level stage, WFP total food aid is entirely \nfree of donor interest bias. The same is true for emergency aid with the exception of \nvoting similarity with Western countries. More populous and more food import \ndependent countries as well as those, which host a higher number of refugees, receive \nmore total and emergency food aid. Poorer countries also receive more total food aid. \n \n< Insert Table 4 about here > \n \nLastly, NGO donors\u2019 food aid allocation is examined in table 5. More populous \ncountries and those, which host a higher number of refugees and have a lower per capita \n16 \nsupply of calories, are more likely to receive both total and emergency food aid. A \npreference towards countries geographically closer to the US or Western Europe is \napparent at the aid eligibility stage for both total and emergency aid. In addition, \ncountries with voting patterns in the UN general assembly similar to Western countries \nare more likely to receive total food aid. At the level stage, with respect to recipient \nneed it is only countries hosting more refugees that receive statistically significantly \nmore aid than others. Perhaps surprisingly, countries, which receive a higher share of \nUS military aid receive more food aid from NGOs. No other donor interest bias is \napparent. These results hold for both total and emergency aid. \n \n< Insert Table 5 about here > \n \nIt is possible to argue that for WFP and NGO food aid no influence of donor \ninterest is to be expected and that the inclusion of such variables might lead to biased \nestimates for the recipient need variables due to model specification error. In non-\nreported sensitivity analysis we have therefore estimated the allocation of food aid by \nthese two donors again with the donor interest variables excluded. The results for the \nremaining recipient need variables are very similar to the ones reported above, \nsuggesting that potential specification error does not represent a major concern here. \n \nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS \nIs food aid allocation free from donor interest? Not quite so, as the results of the \nanalysis here have shown. In particular, almost all donors give preference to countries \nthat are geographically close to the donor or to the US or Western Europe in case of \nWFP and NGO aid. The geographical proximity bias need not be interpreted strictly in \n17 \nterms of donor interest as the attempt to maintain a regional sphere of influence. The \nplight of geographically closer countries is also more salient in the public perception \nand those of policy makers. In addition, in the case of the US and the EU the \ngeographical bias could also imply that these donors are willing to assume \nresponsibility for their respective regions. Food aid seems to be used sometimes to \nreward political allies as measured by similar UN general assembly voting patters. \nPerhaps more importantly, however, and contrary to general ODA, food aid is not used \nto reward countries in which donors have economic export interests. In non-reported \nsensitivity analysis we checked that this holds true not only for food, but for exports of \nall other goods and services as well. Neither do donors pursue military-strategic \ninterests in food aid allocation. The only exception to this is NGO aid at the level stage, \nwhere major recipients of US military aid also receive more NGO food aid. This result \ncould be down to chance of course. Equally, no bias towards former Western colonies is \napparent. This represents quite an important result that stands in striking contrast to the \nallocation of general ODA. Interestingly, there is no difference apparent between the US \non the one hand and the multilateral donors WFP and EU as well as NGOs on the other \nhand. This also stands in contrast to the allocation of general ODA, for which the US \ntogether with France is often found to promote vigorously its own interest [Neumayer, \n2003a, 2003c]. \nOne or the other aspect of recipient need impacts upon the food aid allocation of \nalmost all donors at both stages and with respect to both emergency and total food aid. \nNot surprisingly, given the prominent humanitarian role of the WFP and NGOs in \nrelieving food aid needs in disaster situations, we find that the number of refugees \nhosted has a statistically significant impact at both levels and for both emergency and \ntotal food aid of these donors. On the whole, EU food aid allocation seems to take \n18 \nrecipient need most comprehensively into account, whereas the opposite is the case for \nUS food aid allocation. Even in the case of US food aid, however, it is only at the level \nstage of emergency aid that one or the other variable of recipient need does not test \nsignificantly. \nSome have suggested that WFP food aid is not well allocated with respect to \nrecipient need and have explained this with the fact that the WFP gives aid to a great \nmany countries. \u2018The WFP has always followed a policy, as a UN agency, of the widest \ncoverage with its multilateral donations of the maximum number of countries eligible to \nreceive food aid, rather than concentrating its food resources in larger projects and \nprogrammes\u2019 [Cathie 1997: 104]. Gabbert and Weikard [2000: 213] similarly argue that \nthe widespread WFP delivery of food aid \u2018is less effective, because it means that a large \nfraction of the aid goes to countries not having the most urgent needs\u2019. However, our \nestimation results do not back this claim and instead support the opposite findings of \nBarrett and Heisey [2002] as WFP food aid allocation in the 1990s appears quite \nsensitive to recipient need throughout and at both stages. \nPopulation size has a positive impact upon food aid allocation almost throughout. \nAt the level stage, we are not surprised to find that more populous countries receive \nmore food. Given that both the dependent and the population size variables are in \nnatural logs, one can interpret the estimated coefficients as elasticities. With estimated \nelasticities of below one in all cases we find evidence that the well-known population \nbias of general ODA [Isenman, 1976] towards less populous countries in terms of per \ncapita aid allocated carries over to food aid as well. The positive effect of population \nsize at the food aid eligibility stage almost throughout is more puzzling, however. The \nbias is probably due to the higher saliency of more populous countries in the public \nmind and that of policy makers alike. It also represents some cause for concern, \n19 \nhowever, as there is no reason to presume that less populous countries are any less in \nneed of food aid than more populous ones. \nAll in all, the fact that food aid appears to be less biased towards donors\u2019 interests \nis to be welcomed from a normative point of view. Aid should be allocated on the basis \nof recipient need, not of donor interest. The allocation of food aid in the 1990s seems to \ncomply with this requirement to a greater extent than general ODA. In particular, the \n\u201chard\u201d economic export and military-strategic interests that impact upon much of the \nallocation of general ODA has no impact on the allocation of food aid. \nIn future research, it might be interesting to do a similar analysis for the period \nbefore 1990 to compare the results from before and after the end of the cold war more \ndirectly. Another direction worth taking would be to simulate what the allocation \npattern of food aid would look like if it was entirely free from donor interest bias and to \ncompare the results either with actual food allocations or the ones predicted by our \nestimated models. Such an analysis would shed even more light on how important the \nimpact of donor bias on food aid allocation actually is. \n20 \n                                                 \n1\n European food aid is actually a mixture of aid channelled to recipient countries via the European \nCommission and national programmes. We look here at aid allocated by the Commission. Contrary to \ngeneral ODA where the national programmes are larger than the common one, Commission food aid is \nmuch larger than national European food aid programmes. \n2\n They do not estimate a stage two model for Title I aid as there are too few eligible countries and do not \nestimate a stage one model for Title II aid as almost all countries receive some Title II aid. This is a \nconsequence of their decision to restrict the sample to Sub-Saharan African countries. \n3\n Progressivity only holds if no region-specific dummy variables are included in the estimations. \n4\n Strictly speaking, no exclusionary variable is required, but in its absence the validity of estimations \ndepends on restrictive distributional assumptions only [Breen, 1996]. \n21 \nREFERENCES \nAlesina, Alesina and David Dollar, 2000, \u2018Who Gives Foreign Aid to Whom and \nWhy?\u2019, Journal of Economic Growth, Vol. 5, No. 1, pp.33\u201363. \nBall, Richard and Christopher Johnson, 1996, \u2018Political, Economic, and Humanitarian \nMotivations for PL 480 Food Aid: Evidence from Africa\u2019, Economic Development \nand Cultural Change, Vol. 44, No. 2, pp.515-37. \nBarrett, Christopher B. and K.C.
