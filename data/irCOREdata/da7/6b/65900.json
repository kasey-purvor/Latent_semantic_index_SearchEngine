A signature of classical chaos is the\nergodic filling of regions in phase space. Applying this\ncriterion in the search for chaos in wave mechanical sys-\ntems, e.g., the linear Schro\u00a8dinger equation in quantum\nmechanics, the uncertainty relations dictate that trajecto-\nries are smeared out. Chaos is impossible to observe when\ndispersion dominates over the exponential divergence of\nneighboring trajectories. Nondispersive waves such as soli-\ntary waves or solitons are therefore of particular interest in\nthe study of chaotic dynamics. In this case, particle-like\nchaotic behavior may be well-defined in wave mechanical\nsystems.\nSolitary waves may be found in solutions to nonlinear\nwave equations where the nonlinearity counteracts the\ndispersion of a wave packet such that it retains its form\nas it propagates. An example is the nonlinear Schro\u00a8dinger\nequation (NLSE), employed to describe diverse physical\nsystems, e.g., light propagating in fibre-optics [2], and as\nan approximation to the dynamics of dilute atomic Bose-\nEinstein condensates (BEC) [3], where it is called the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). Solitons are solitary\nwaves that emerge unscathed from collisions, up to shifts\nin position and phase [4]; this is reminiscent of particle\nbehavior, motivating the particle-like name soliton. The\nhomogeneous 1D NLSE with attractive nonlinearity sup-\nports bright soliton solutions [4], so-called because they\nrepresent a peak (rather than a trough) in intensity in a\nnonlinear-optical setting, or in particle density in BEC.\nMacroscopic quantum states of multiple bright solitary\nmatter-waves present an interesting testing ground for\nwave chaos. In general all wave packet evolution predicted\nby the Schro\u00a8dinger equation is periodic or quasiperiodic,\ndue to its linearity. The nonlinearity in the 1D GPE and\nassociated solitary wave solutions may break all periodic-\nity, leading to the realization of ergodic behavior, i.e.,\nrecognizably chaotic dynamics.\nBright solitary waves have been the subject of substan-\ntial experimental and theoretical investigation in nonlinear\noptics [2,5,6], and BEC [7\u201311]. Notably, chaotic and regu-\nlar soliton behavior have been observed theoretically in a\nNLSE with a \u0001-kicked rotor potential [12]. In BEC experi-\nments, the magnetic or optical trap employed to confine\nthe constituent atoms introduces a position-dependent\npotential. In this Letter, we investigate to what extent\nsolitary wave collisions in a harmonic potential provide a\nparadigm for particle-like chaotic behavior in a wave\nmechanical system. Because of this potential, bright\nsolitary waves in a harmonically trapped system are not\ntrue solitons; however, it will be shown that the particle\nnature of the solitary waves is very pronounced, so the\nbright solitary waves in this system will from now on be\ncalled solitons. To test the extent of the soliton behavior,\nwe introduce a particle model, adapted from a nonlinear\noptics context for a NLSE with a sinusoidal external\npotential [5]. In this model, constructed for the regime\nwhere the solitary waves are well-separated before and\nafter collisions, the waves are modeled as interacting clas-\nsical particles. Within this model, we show that the\ntwo-soliton case is integrable, but for three (or more)\nsolitons, one can expect chaotic dynamics. The results\nare compared to numerical solutions of the GPE, and\nprovide a probe of the coexisting particle and wave prop-\nerties of bright solitary waves. The most surprising result is\nthat the particle-like behavior is preserved even in the\nchaotic regime. In contrast to the linear Schro\u00a8dinger equa-\ntion, where the evolution of localized wave packets is\nrapidly disrupted in regimes supporting classically chaotic\ndynamics [1], the soliton solutions appear to be remarkably\nrobust. At temperatures encountered in atomic BEC ex-\nperiments (nK or lower), the atom-atom interaction poten-\ntial may generally be replaced by an effective contact\ninteraction, quantified by the s-wave scattering length, a.\nDepending on species, this may be positive or negative,\nand may also be tuned using an external magnetic field\n[13]. In the case of a trapped, almost fully Bose-condensed\ndilute atomic gas, the dynamics are largely governed by the\nfollowing GPE:\nPRL 98, 020402 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending12 JANUARY 2007\n0031-9007=07=98(2)=020402(4) 020402-1 \u00a9 2007 The American Physical Society\n i@\n@\n@t\n\u0001\u0002r; t\u0003 \u0004\n\u0001\n\u0001 @\n2r2\n2m\n\u0005 Vext\u0002r\u0003\n\u0005 g3DNj\u0001\u0002r; t\u0003j2\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0002r; t\u0003; (1)\nwhere N is the total number of atoms, m the atomic mass,\nand \u0001\u0002r; t\u0003 the condensate mode-function, normalized to\none. The atom-atom interactions are quantified by g3D \u0004\n4\u0002@2a=m, where, in this Letter, a is negative. The propor-\ntion of noncondensate atoms is thus assumed to be negli-\ngible. However, linear instabilities in the GPE directly\nimply [14,15] that the population of the noncondensate\ncomponent may rapidly become significant. Regimes\nwhere soliton collision dynamics have a chaotic character\nare thus of additional interest, as they may coincide with a\ngreater tendency for linear instability, and hence implicitly\nwith condensate depletion [16].\nThe regime of interest for the study of solitons is the\nquasi-1D case, where the atoms are trapped in a radially\ntight harmonic trap with loose harmonic axial confinement.\nWe may assume a harmonic ground state (Gaussian) ansatz\nin the radial direction, since the harmonic potential energy\ndominates. The GPE then takes the form\n i\n@\n@t\n \u0002x\u0003 \u0004\n\u0003\n\u0001 1\n2\n@2\n@x2\n\u0005!\n2x2\n2\n \u0002x\u0003 \u0001 j \u0002x\u0003j2\n\u0004\n \u0002x\u0003; (2)\nwhere x is now measured in units of @2=mjg1DjN and t in\nunits of @3=mjg1Dj2N2 with g1D \u0004 2@!ra, !r is the radial\ntrapping frequency and! is the axial frequency in our units\nof inverse time. In the case of zero axial potential, an exact\nsolution exists [4], comprising an arbitrary number of well-\nseparated solitons taking the form\n \u0002i\u0002x; t\u0003 \u0004 2\u0003isech\u00062\u0003i\u0002x\u0001 qi\u0003\u0007eivi\u0002x\u0001qi\u0003ei\u00022\u00032i\u0005v2i =2\u0003tei\u00040i ;\n(3)\nwhere qi \u0004 vit\u0005 x0i is the position of the peak of the ith\nsoliton; x0i is the peak position at t \u0004 0; \u00040i \u0001 vix0i is the\nphase at x \u0004 0, t \u0004 0; and vi are the soliton velocities. Our\nnormalization condition implies that\nPNs\ni 4\u0003i \u0004 1, where\nNs is the number of solitons present. When these solitons\nemerge from collisions, they suffer position shifts depen-\ndent on vi (initial speeds), and \u0003i (effective masses) only.\nThe outgoing soliton motion is independent of the relative\nphase [4] (see Fig. 1).\nThe particle model follows the approach of Scharf and\nBishop [5], which reproduces the position shifts following\ncollisions, and also reproduces the motion due to the trap-\nping potential, while neglecting the phase behavior. This\napproach is appropriate when the solitons are well sepa-\nrated between collisions. It is not appropriate for soliton\ntrains, as observed by Strecker et al. [8], and modeled by\nGordon [17], and by Gerdjikov et al. [18], where the\nsolitons are never well separated, and the phase difference\nhas an important effect. Parker et al. have modeled bright\nmatter-wave soliton collisions [11] using the 3D GPE at or\nnear the quasi-1D regime. Taking the full 3D GPE dynam-\nics into account highlights some important deviations from\nthe 1D dynamics: in particular, collapse may occur during\ncollisions of solitons having slow approach speeds, with\nsensitivity to the relative phase of the solitons. Above a\nparticular threshold velocity, the quasi-1D model can be\nexpected to hold, including the observed phase-\ninsensitivity of the collision dynamics.\nFollowing reference [5], the effect of the external po-\ntential is deduced by using the one soliton solution of the\nhomogeneous case as an ansatz for the system with a\nharmonic potential, and evaluating the constant norm and\nenergy functionals. This gives equations of motion for the\nsolitons in the external potential. We add an interparticle\npotential which reproduces the position shifts of the sol-\nitons on emerging from collisions with each other, inferred\nfrom the exact solution to the homogeneous NLSE, which\nare assumed not to change upon the addition of the\nposition-dependent external potential.

The Hamiltonian separates\ninto the center-of-mass energy E (dependent on P and Q\nonly), and the \u2018\u2018relative energy\u2019\u2019 \u0007 (dependent on p and q\nonly). The two independent constants of the motion, E and\n\u0007, as many as there are degrees of freedom, imply the\nparticle model for two solitons is integrable and the dy-\nnamics must be completely regular. The same argument\nholds for nonidentical masses.\nIn the case of three solitons (Ns \u0004 3), the situation is\ndifferent. When the masses are identical, a coordinate\nchange may be made to QT=\u0003 :\u0004 \u0002q1 \u0005 q2 \u0005 q3\u0003=3, the\ncenter-of-mass position, and qc=\u0003 :\u0004 \u0002q1 \u0001 q3\u0003=2 (corre-\nsponding to the \u2018\u2018stretch\u2019\u2019 mode) and qr=\u0003 :\u0004 \u0002q1 \u0005 q3 \u0001\n2q2\u0003 (corresponding to the \u2018\u2018asymmetric stretch\u2019\u2019 mode),\nthe normal coordinates of the system for small displace-\nments from the origin. These modes are similar to the\nvibrational modes in a triatomic molecule [19]; as the\nsystem is constrained to 1D, however, there is no analogue\nof the molecular bending mode. Rescaling time ~t \u0004 \u00032t,\nand introducing the momenta pc \u0004 2 _qc and pr \u0004 _qr=6, we\nmay remove the center-of-mass behavior from the prob-\nlem.

The form of ~H [Eq. (5)] is\nsuch that without the interaction, the system is integrable,\nas it becomes a decoupled pair of harmonic oscillators.\nWhen ~H is large and positive, the interaction part (which is\nalways negative) gives a small contribution, compared to\nthe integrable part of ~H (which is always positive). When\n~H is reduced, chaos is emergent, illustrated by ergodic\nmixing of the trajectories in phase space. The Poincare\u00b4\nsection plotted is of an intermediate regime with both\nergodic regions and regular tori.\nFigure 3 shows a comparison of trajectories in the\nparticle model with results from integrations of the 1D\nGPE [Eq. (2)]. The comparisons illustrate the good agree-\nment in the regimes in which the particle model is valid,\ni.e., when solitons are well-separated between collisions\n[Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)], even when the motion is chaotic\n[Fig. 3(b)]. When two of the solitons are not well separated\n[Fig. 3(c)], the 1D GPE simulation shows that a \u2018\u2018bound\nstate\u2019\u2019 is formed, which looks like a single \u2018\u2018higher-order\u2019\u2019\nsoliton with an excited breathing mode [20]. The particle\nmodel does not predict well the behavior within the\n\u2018\u2018bound state,\u2019\u2019 but does give a good prediction of the\ncenter-of-mass motion of the \u2018\u2018bound state\u2019\u2019 and its inter-\nactions with the other soliton; it is likely that the behavior\nof the density of the \u2018\u2018bound state\u2019\u2019 is strongly coupled to\nthe phase behavior within the \u2018\u2018bound state.\u2019\u2019\nHarmonically trapped solitons thus have strong particle\ncharacteristics. Even in chaotic regimes, where the expo-\nnential growth of linear instabilities is most prevalent, the\nsoliton solution is remarkably robust. An echo of the wave-\nequation origin of the particle model is that, consistent with\nthe attractive interaction potential, the particles pass\nthrough each other subsequent to collisions. The particle\nmodel is much quicker to solve than the 1D GPE (involv-\ning four real variables, rather than a continuous complex-\nvalued function); thus Poincare\u00b4 sections (see Fig. 2) can\nrapidly build up a qualitative idea of the many-soliton\nbehavior.\nExperimental demonstration of such chaotic dynamics\nin a wave mechanical system requires a relatively straight-\nforward adaption of recent experiments [8\u201310]. For ex-\nample, a system of 3 solitons can be created reproducibly\nby careful choice of the initial conditions [10].\nManipulation of the optical trapping potential during\nthe solitons\u2019 creation will allow the solitons\u2019 initial veloc-\nities to be chosen. Chaotic regions of phase space may\nbe probed by measuring the sensitivity of the subsequent\nevolution of the density distribution to the initial\ncondition.\n \nFIG. 2 (color online).

The figure corresponds to the regime where the\nsolitons have equal effective masses, the axial trapping fre-\nquency is 10 Hz, and the other parameters (radial trap frequency\nof 800 Hz, mass and scattering length of 7Li, and 5000 particles\nper soliton) correspond to recent experiment [8].\nPRL 98, 020402 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending12 JANUARY 2007\n020402-3\nAn effective classical particle model has been derived\nfor many solitons in the NLSE with a harmonic potential.\nThis applies to a dilute BEC of attractive atoms in the\nquasi-1D limit of a cigar-shaped trap. Within this model\ntwo-soliton dynamics are fully integrable and regular, but\nthree solitons may display chaotic dynamics when atom-\natom interactions are significant. The particle model ex-\nhibits good agreement with the 1D GPE in the regime of\nlarge separation of the solitons before and after collisions,\neven when the particle motion is chaotic. This confirms the\nsurprising robustness of bright matter-wave solitons, as\nobserved experimentally [8\u201310]. There is a good degree\nof agreement even when \u2018\u2018bound states\u2019\u2019 are modeled\n(states not in a regime of large separation). Chaotic regions\nmay also be a useful predictor of regimes of condensate\ninstability, which can be explored with a fuller treatment of\nthe condensate and noncondensate atoms [15].\nWe thank J.

Trajectories in the particle model (lines)\nplotted over density distributions predicted by 1D GPE dynam-\nics, corresponding to (a) a regular orbit, (b) a chaotic orbit, and\n(c) a bound state, as shown in Fig. 2. In the center of the bound\nstate, the density increases to \t0:5 normalized units, but our\nscale is pinned at 0.14 units in order to resolve the low density\nregions better. Here ~H \u0004 10, the solitons have equal effective\nmasses, the axial trapping frequency is 10 Hz, and other pa-\nrameters (radial trap frequency of 800 Hz, atomic mass and\nscattering length of 7Li, and 5000 particles per soliton) corre-\nspond to recent experiment [8]. The unit of x is then \u0004 2:4 \u0006m,\nand a unit of t \u0004 0:6 ms.\nPRL 98, 020402 (2007) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending12 JANUARY 2007\n020402-4\n"}
