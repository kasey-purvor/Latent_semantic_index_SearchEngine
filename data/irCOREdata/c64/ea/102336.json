INTRODUCTION\nWe have used the Dutch free-electron laser ~entitled FE-\nLIX, free-electron laser for infrared experiments! to measure\nspin lifetimes in the long-wavelength narrow-gap semicon-\nductors ~NGS\u2019s! Hg12xCdxTe and InSb at wavelengths be-\ntween 4 and 10 mm and from 4 to 300 K. In particular, we\nmeasure remarkably long spin lifetimes even at 300 K in\ndegenerate n-InSb. We note that apart from one report of\nspin relaxation in InAs ~Ref. 1! at 300 K, these are the first\nmeasurements of spin lifetime to be made in NGS\u2019s at tem-\nperatures above nitrogen temperature. These first results are\nbeing extended to a range of compositions, mobilities, and\ntemperatures, both to explore the physics determining spin\nrelaxation in NGS\u2019s and to establish conditions required to\noptimize the spin lifetime.\nIn bulk semiconductors three main spin relaxation pro-\ncesses have been found to be important in optical orientation\nexperiments: the Elliott-Yafet2 ~EY!, D\u2019yakonov-Perel3\n~DP!, and the Bir-Aronov-Pikus4 ~BAP! mechanisms. The\nBAP mechanism is thought to be particularly important in\np-type wide-gap materials and is based on the electron-hole\nexchange interaction. By contrast with the other two pro-\ncesses, it depends directly on the concentration of holes and\nis not thought to be important in n-type narrow-gap semicon-\nductors.\nThe EY mechanism results from the fact that in real crys-\ntals Bloch states are not spin eigenstates because of the\nstrong spin-orbit coupling induced by the lattice ions. In the0163-1829\/2003\/67~23!\/235202~5!\/$20.00 67 2352presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, the valence-band\nstates have mixed spin character. In NGS\u2019s the conduction-\nelectron states, in turn, are strongly mixed with the valence\nstates through the k\u0095p interaction across a narrow energy\ngap. In this case spin-independent interactions with impuri-\nties, boundaries, phonons, etc., can connect spin-up and\n-down electrons, leading to a relaxation whose rate 1\/ts is\nproportional to 1\/tp where tp is the orbital momentum ~mo-\nbility! scattering time. This process is thought to be impor-\ntant in NGS\u2019s.5,6\nThe DP mechanism is expected to dominate in large-gap\nn-type semiconductors that lack inversion symmetry so that\nthe k-dependent spin-orbit interaction lifts the spin degen-\neracy even in the absence of a magnetic field.3 Somewhat\ncounterintuitively and in contrast with EY, the spin relax-\nation rate 1\/ts is subject to motional narrowing and is there-\nfore directly proportional to the orbital ~mobility! scattering\ntime tp . In NGS\u2019s both the EY and DP mechanisms may be\nimportant, as shown by reports of spin relaxation in InSb at\nhelium temperature5\u20137 and InAs at room temperature1\u2014the\nformer being interpreted in terms of EY and the latter of DP.\nTypically spin lifetimes in the range 1\u201310 ns were obtained\nfrom spin resonance in InSb at helium temperatures, whereas\na spin lifetime of 20 ps was reported for InAs at 300 K. It\ntherefore has been unclear whether enhancement of the spin\nlifetime may be achieved with higher or lower mobility\nsamples, which is affected by, e.g., layer thickness through\ninterface scattering, as well as by sample temperature. Addi-\ntional factors influence the spin relaxation, and we report its\u00a92003 The American Physical Society02-1\nP. MURZYN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 67, 235202 ~2003!measurement as a function of doping, mobility, and tempera-\nture in order to investigate systematically the dominant\nmechanisms.\nWe find, in accordance with the earlier work,5,6 that at\nleast for small-band-gap HgCdTe and InSb it is indeed the\nEY mechanism that dominates, giving good agreement with\nboth the magnitude and temperature dependence of ts up to\n300 K ~see below!.\nA key step in controlling spin relaxation has been the\nobservation of a large enhancement of the spin memory of\nelectrons by n-type doping in both bulk ~GaAs! semiconduc-\ntor and quantum wells ~ZnCdSe!: ts is found to increase by\nseveral orders of magnitude over corresponding intrinsic\nmaterial.8,9 We have found a similar effect in n-HgCdTe and\nn-InSb, where we obtain more than an order of magnitude\nenhancement of ts between intrinsic and n-type material.\nThe present tentative explanation for this is that in intrinsic\nsamples, photoexcited spin-polarized holes ~of concentration\n.131016 cm23 in our case! efficiently scatter electron\nspins,4,8\u201311 leading to a short spin relaxation time, which\ndominates the measured value. In the presence of a degener-\nate Fermi sea, the effect of the photoexcited holes is removed\nby screening, and a longer electron spin relaxation time is\nmeasured. It is also true that by going to a degenerate distri-\nbution one replaces kT by the Fermi level EF in the theoret-\nical expression for ts , thereby removing some of the strong\ntemperature dependence of ts.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nWe have developed a setup at FELIX to utilize both the\npolarization pump-probe method1,12,13 and the Faraday rota-\ntion method9,11,13 in the 5\u201310 mm region in order to examine\nthe spin relaxation times of bulk epilayers of long-\nwavelength Hg12xCdxTe and InSb as a function of tempera-\nture, doping, and mobility. The principal modification we\nhave to make is that we are using FELIX to generate the\nlong-wavelength ~ps! pump-probe radiation, with corre-\nsponding long-wavelength plane and circular polarizers. We\nuse the three-beam balanced pump-probe setup described\nelsewhere.14 The only difference here is that we have a cir-\ncular polarizer in the pump beam consisting of a variable\nquarter-wave plate and utilizing the plane polarization of FE-\nLIX. The probe beam was either circularly polarized for the\npolarization pump-probe technique or plane polarized for the\nFaraday rotation technique. The short-wave limit of our mea-\nsurements (;4 mm) and the pulse duration (;1 \u2013 5 ps) are\ndetermined by FELIX. A varitemp cryostat enables measure-\nments in the range 4\u2013300 K.\nBoth methods rely on the fact that because of the different\ntransition strengths associated with heavy hole and light hole\nto conduction-band transitions from a complex ~spin-orbit\nmixed! valence band, a partially spin-polarized distribution\nwill be created by pumping with circularly polarized radia-\ntion. We note that the spin relaxation will be dominated by\nelectrons, as the fourfold degeneracy of the valence band at\nk50 and the large spin-orbit coupling are expected to result\nin extremely rapid decay of the hole spin polarization.\nIf we take the case of ~e.g.! a left circularly polarized23520pump pulse ~s!, the relative concentration of optically gen-\nerated spin-up to spin-down electrons is 3:1, leading to a\nmaximum spin polarization of Ps50.5 where1,12,13\nPs5~n\u21912n\u2193 !\/~n\u21911n\u2193 !. ~1!\nIn the circularly polarized pump-probe method one deter-\nmines the difference between probe transmission for the\nsame circularly polarized pump and probe ~SCP! and oppo-\nsite circularly polarized pump and probe ~OCP!. The actually\nmeasured probe transmission is proportional to the absorp-\ntion change Da. A s2 probe will experience Da2}3nopt\u2191\n1nopt\u2193 , while a s1 probe will experience Da1}3nopt\u2193\n1nopt\u2191 . Thus the optical polarization signal becomes\nPopt5~SCP2OCP!\/~SCP1OCP!\n5~Da22Da1!\/~Da21Da1!50.5Ps , ~2!\nwhich has maximum value 0.25.\nIf there is a background concentration of unpolarized\nelectrons, nb , then this will be correspondingly reduced,1\nP50.25\/~11nb \/nopt!. ~3!\nIn the Faraday rotation method, the probe is plane polar-\nized. Then, the excess population of n\u2191 over n\u2193 electrons\nproduced by s pumping gives a differential dispersion be-\ntween the left and right circularly polarized components of\nthe plane polarized probe, and hence a Faraday rotation. We\nmeasure this by setting an analyzer at 1 or 245\u00b0 to the\npolarizer and determining the difference in transmitted signal\nintensity I145 and I245 , respectively. Then for small angles\nwe have for the Faraday rotation, u,\n2u\u2019~I1452I245!\/~I1451I245!. ~4!\nAt the present time it has not been possible to set up the\ndifferential optical bridge method of measurement8\u201311 owing\nto the difficulty of obtaining a fast matched detector system\nat these long wavelengths. Our signals are sufficiently large\nto overcome this, but obviously the method would have a\ngreat advantage from the point of view of data retrieval\nspeed and consistency. In the absence of the optical bridge, it\nis more convenient for us to use the polarization pump-probe\nmethod where possible, because we do not have any wave-\nlength restrictions resulting from imperfect plane polarizers.\nWe utilize the plane polarized beam from FELIX in conjunc-\ntion with a variable quarter-wave plate ~optimized for each\nwavelength by simply adjusting the plate tilt angle!, so that\nwe are not restricted to any particular wavelength range.\nWe have measured the set of InSb and Hg12xCdxTe\nsamples shown in Table I, produced ~either from the in-house\nstock or purpose grown! by QinetiQ and BAE Systems, spe-\ncifically to study the effect of carrier type and concentration,\nand carrier ~Hall! mobility on electron spin lifetimes of\nNGS\u2019s.2-2\nELECTRON SPIN LIFETIMES IN LONG-WAVELENGTH . . .

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nA. InSb\nChronologically, our first experiments were on lightly\ndoped n-InSb (nd;131015 cm23 at 77 K!, ME1654 and\nME1655. Results are shown for sample ME1655 in Fig. 1. A\nsurprisingly short spin lifetime was obtained ~measured de-\ncay time ts;16 ps between 77 and 300 K!. However, the\nfact that the initial degree of polarization was P;0.2, which\nis close to the theoretical limit of Eq. ~2!, gives confidence to\nthe measurement ~given imperfect circular polarization at\nthese long wavelengths!. In order to test whether these mea-\nsurements were being dominated by photoinduced holes un-\nder FELIX excitation (nopt;131016 cm23 at the intensities\nused!, we repeated the measurements for more heavily doped\nn-type material ~sample ME1629, nd5231017 cm23). A\nsubstantially longer spin lifetime was obtained (t;300 ps at\n300 K!, in broad agreement also with the prediction ~200 ps,\nfor a smaller carrier concentration! in Ref. 15. This sample\nwas difficult to measure using this technique because the size\nof the polarization achieved was reduced in the presence of a\nFIG. 1.

There was a significant Burstein-Moss shift mea-\nsured in the doped sample, necessitating pumping further\nabove the band edge, with correspondingly higher absorption\ncoefficient and resultant nopt than for ME1655.! In order to\ncheck that this result was not some artifact of the experimen-\ntal method used, we repeated it using the Faraday rotation\nmethod and obtained consistent results, Fig. 2. We also mea-\nsured the temperature dependence for the n-type material\n~both ME1629 and ME1722! where we obtained an approxi-\nmately constant value for ts . N.B. In this case the mobility\nwas more or less constant between 77 and 300 K ~47 700 and\n41 500 cm2 V-1 s21, respectively\u2014the ionized impurity and\nlattice scattering processes approximately cancel in this\nrange!, and degenerate statistics apply.\nA feature which becomes apparent on inspection of Figs.\n1 and 2 is that with increasing nopt , the decay of population\nas a whole by Auger recombination becomes more pro-\nFIG. 2.

HgCdTe\nIn parallel with the above we have been investigating\nHg12xCdxTe ~of composition x50.2\u2013 0.3) with a band gap\ncomparable to that of InSb. N.B. The band gap of InSb in-\ncreases as the temperature is lowered, whereas that of\nHg12xCdxTe has the opposite temperature dependence, so\nthat it is not possible to get a perfect match. Our first results\nfor moderately doped p-type Hg12xCdxTe ~GVG763! gave\nshort lifetimes t;20 ps, consistent with the results for\nlightly doped InSb. Furthermore, when we repeated the mea-\nsurements for heavily doped p-Hg12xCdxTe ~GVG775, p\n;131017 cm23) we obtained an even shorter lifetime,\nprobably limited by the resolution of our method (;5 ps).\nHowever, when we then moved to the moderately n-type\nsample ~G256, n;331016 cm23) we obtained a substan-\ntially longer lifetime, Fig. 3, in accordance with the InSb\nresults. Finally, we again measured the temperature depen-\ndence of the lifetime, Fig. 4, where we expect a pronounced\neffect since lattice scattering is dominant for HgCdTe and we\nhave a nondegenerate distribution. We found that the spin\nlifetime scaled approximately as T27\/2 as expected for the\nEY model for a nondegenerate distribution with lattice scat-\ntering dominant, as described in the next section.\nIV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\nAs already pointed out the scattering models that can con-\ntribute to spin relaxation in NGS\u2019s are the EY and DP models\nas follows.\nElliott-Yafet2,5,6 (EY ). The conduction\u2013valence-band in-\nteraction through k\u0095p terms, in the presence of nonparabo-\nlicity and strong spin-orbit coupling, leads to the following\nFIG. 3.
