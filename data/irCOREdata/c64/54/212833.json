Health-check interventions are one such strategy, and have been demonstrated to effect health gains over the following 12-month period. However, little is known about their effects on service use and costs, and hence how affordable such interventions are. Methods: We examined service use patterns and costs over a 12-month period for 50 adult participants with intellectual disabilities who received a health-check intervention and 50 individually matched control participants who received standard care only. Results: The health-check intervention was cheap, and it did not have associated higher costs in terms of service usage. Indeed, mean cost of care for the adults who received standard care only was greater than for the adults who received the health-check intervention. The higher costs were due to differences in unpaid carer support costs. Conclusion: This is the first study to report the associated service use, and costs of a health-check intervention to improve the health of adults with intellectual disabilities and reduce health inequalities.
