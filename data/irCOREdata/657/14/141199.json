Introduction1\nThis study models human exposures to the air pollution control (APC) residues from2\nmunicipal waste incinerators in England following their disposal to landfill. The research3\nwas initiated to help ensure the safe and effective management of these hazardous wastes at4\nreceiving landfill sites (Environment Agency, 2002). There are 11 municipal waste5\nincinerators in England (Environment Agency, 2002). Most are located in and around major6\nconurbations where landfills are more distant; with ca. two-thirds of the incineration capacity7\nin England in London and the west Midlands (38.5% w\/w and 30% w\/w respectively). Each of8\nthe 11 facilities has been either recently (since 1996) commissioned or significantly modified9\nto meet the requirements of the Waste Incineration Directive (2000\/76\/EC; European10\nParliament and Council of the European Union, 2000). The incinerators are employed at11\ntheir design capacity, burning a total of ca. 2.65 MTpa (2002) of municipal solid waste12\n(MSW). Between them, they recover heat to raise steam and generate a total of 197 MWe of13\nelectricity for the national grid. In 2002, MSW accounted for ca. 90%w\/w of the waste14\nburned by municipal waste incinerators, the rest being non-hazardous commercial and15\nindustrial waste, the greatest quantities of which were burned at the Edmonton and Lewisham16\nsites in London (Environment Agency, 2002).17\nThe potential public health risks from incinerators have been extensively reviewed18\n(Rabl and Spadaro, 2002). Combustion gases from MSW incineration are acidic because19\nmaterials in MSW contain chlorine and sulphur. The gases contain dioxins and furans20\n(PCDDs\/PCDFs) and high concentrations of fine particles (Basham and Whitwell, 1999;21\nWeber et al., 1999; Ma, 2002). Adding lime to neutralise excess acid cleans the exhaust22\ngases and finely divided carbon is employed to remove dioxins and metals (Brna and Kilgroe,23\n1992). The fine ash particles, carbon and lime are removed by high efficiency bag filters.24\nThe carbon and fly ash contain most of the dioxins produced. The solid residues from25\n3municipal waste incinerators, (i) bottom ash; and (ii) APC residues (the subject of this paper)1\nare controlled wastes and regulated by the Environment Agency under the Environmental2\nProtection Act, 1990. Methods for the safe disposal of these wastes have been summarised3\nby Hjelmar (1996). Operators of landfills and treatment plant accepting bottom ash or APC4\nresidues require a permit from the Agency and are under a specific duty to ensure their5\nactivities do not harm the environment or human health.6\n7\n1.1 Problem formulation and study rationale8\nThis study was initiated before recent changes to hazardous waste legislation that9\nhave reduced the number of available outlets for APC residues. In 2002 within England and10\nWales, bottom ash was either landfilled, processed to produce an aggregate substitute or used11\nin treatment plants. APC residues were either landfilled or used in licensed waste treatment12\nplant to neutralise and\/or solidify other hazardous wastes. In 2002, 88% w\/w of APC residues13\nwent directly to landfill (Environment Agency, 2002). The study reported here was initiated14\nto assess the significance of the off-site risks associated with the landfill disposal of APC15\nresidues at the principal sites of bulk disposal. Off-site exposure may occur through APC16\nresidues becoming airborne with onward inhalation or through indirect exposure at some17\npoint distant from the site of disposal (Kosson et al., 1996). On-site occupational risks were18\nnot the subject of this study.19\nTo identify the disposal locations for APC residues, incinerators and energy-from-20\nwaste (EfW) plants in England and Wales were contacted and the relative amounts of APC21\nresidues disposed to a number of licensed landfills estimated. The Environment Agency22\n(2002) identified 18 destinations for the disposal of APC residues - 12 landfill sites and 623\nwaste treatment plants. Of the 12 landfills, 6 received APC residues directly and 6 received24\ntreated wastes incorporating APC residues. The principal sites accepting APC residues (as of25\n4September 2001; Table 1) were selected on the basis of available information on the relative1\namounts of APC residues disposed of in the year 2000-2001. Between them, the sites2\nidentified received 75 % w\/w of the total weight of APC residues (England and Wales)3\ndisposed of.4\nHaving identified the principal locations, the study applied Government guidelines on5\nenvironmental risk assessment and management (DETR et al., 2000; Figure 1) and, in the6\nlatter stages, focused on the site-specific assessment of potential exposures at key sites of7\nconcern using the best available data and a defensible, albeit conservative, modeling8\napproach. The aim of the study was to assess the significance of these potential exposures9\nadopting a modeling approach.10\n11\n2. Methodology12\n2.1 Risk screening13\nA tiered risk assessment approach to the study was adopted consistent with current14\nguidance in England and Wales (DETR et al., 2000; Figure 1). Relevant baseline15\ninformation, e.g. volumes of APC disposed of, chemical characteristics, potential human16\nexposure pathways and the proximity of potential receptors was collated from the published17\nliterature (Greenberg et al., 1978; Kosson et al., 1996), interviews with operational and18\ntechnical staff and site visits. Summary information (Tables 2 and 3) was used to assemble a19\ngeneralised conceptual model of exposure and to inform a qualitative risk-screening in which20\nkey exposure pathways, comprising source-pathway-receptor relationships of relevance, were21\nidentified. Environment Agency staff with regulatory responsibilities for these sites22\nconsidered the applicability of the conceptual model to the APC landfill for which they had23\nresponsibility and confirmed, or otherwise, the likely existence of pollutant linkages at the24\nsites. A sub-set of feasible pollutant linkages with a \u2018medium\u2019 or \u2018high\u2019 interim risk25\n5characterisation (Table 4) was examined in more detail. Air dispersion modelling was1\nemployed to estimate air quality impacts and screen for the significance of exposures through2\ndirect inhalation. Indirect exposures were then assessed using a generic soil exposure3\nassessment model.4\n5\n2.2 Generic quantitative risk assessment \u2013inhalation of airborne dusts6\nFor inhalation exposures, two complementary air modelling approaches were adopted to7\nprovide a range of estimated dust emission factors from all of the potential dust release8\nactivities that might occur on landfill sites:9\n(i) a simple dust blow model incorporating deposition and dispersion components based on10\nthe USEPA\u2019s fugitive dust model (FDM), used widely to assess the influence of fugitive dust11\nemissions from landfills and similar industrial activities (Fisher and Macqueen, 1981;12\nCowherd et al., 1988) and13\n(ii) the application of AERMOD (Cimorelli et al., 1998), a USEPA air dispersion model14\ndesigned to predict pollutant concentrations from continuous point, area and open pit sources.15\nThis enables the concentrations of windblown APC dusts and contaminant concentrations at16\nnearby human receptors to be estimated. Application of the two approaches is described17\nbelow.18\n19\n2.2.1 Simple dust blow model (SDBM)20\nDefensible source term data are essential for risk assessment but difficult to obtain on21\naccount of the complexities of site topography, waste characteristics and local meteorological22\nconditions. The generation of windblown dust is an important release mechanism for23\ninhalation exposures and has historically been characterised by an analytical model24\ndescribing the dispersion and settling of dust particles (Fisher and Macqueen, 1981). The25\n6relationship is described by a single formula (Ermak, 1977) and the sensitivity of results to1\nassumptions regarding the dispersion and deposition of particles can be tested with ease. The2\nformula (Ermak, 1977) provides the theoretical basis of the USEPA fugitive dust model3\n(FDM), a computerised Gaussian plume dispersion model developed by the USEPA for4\nestimating airborne particulate concentrations (USEPA, 1995). The FDM employs an5\nadvanced gradient transfer particle deposition algorithm (Horst, 1977; Hanna et al., 1982) but6\nno explicit expression of the dust source term - this has to be supplied by the user.7\nHere, the analytical formulae in the dustblow model were setup in an EXCEL\uf0d48\nspreadsheet. Site operations that lead to the generation and emission of dust include (i)9\nvehicle movements over previously deposited waste; (ii) wind erosion from recently10\ndeposited friable waste (before natural crusting of the surface binds material together); and11\n(iii) release when the waste is deposited on the landfill (DoE, 1994; Table 2). Estimates of12\nthe potential dust emission factors from wind erosion of deposited APC residues were made13\nusing USEPA (1995) and DoE (1994) for both storage piles and exposed surfaces. It was14\nassumed that daily disturbance of deposited piles would allow the surface to dry sufficiently15\nfor erosion to occur. The simple dust blow model calculates the wind shear stress at the16\nsurface and the threshold velocity above which erosion and dust release takes place. The17\nsimple dust blow model uses the AP-42 emission factors (USEPA, 1995) for dustblow18\nincluding the particle size relationship (Table 5). The relationship (USEPA, 1995) was used19\nto estimate the emissions (Table 6) of PM10 and PM30 particles, taking no account of dust20\nsuppression or rainfall. Generally, significant emissions of dust were associated with wind21\nerosion from APC residues when wind speeds were greater than 6m\/s and where recently22\ndeposited waste piles were spread to form an even layer. The amounts of APC residues23\nreleased per disturbance event were expressed as an emission rate per day (Table 6) in order24\n7to generate downwind concentrations of respirable dust and contaminants, and to allow1\ncomparisons with air quality standards for airborne dust (Table 7).2\n3\n2.2.2 Limitations in the estimation of source terms4\nSignificant approximations are entertained when applying these modelling techniques5\nto episodic source terms to generate estimates of the impact on air quality (Sax and Isakov,6\n2003). Generalised assumptions included in the empirical relationship of dust generation7\ninclude the silt and moisture content of the surface material and the mean vehicle weight.8\nThe resulting source term estimate is presented as a mass of APC residue emitted per vehicle-9\nkilometre. Uncertainties in the source term model and in approximating the operating area of10\nthe landfill propagate further once air dispersion modelling is undertaken using a simple dust11\nblow model (SDBM). Further, the particle size determines the likely distance that particles12\nwill travel. Large particles greater than about 100 \u03bcm diameter are likely to be deposited13\nwithin a few tens of metres of their point of release. Given the necessities of approximation,14\nverification of the model was attempted through comparison with a risk assessment already15\nundertaken for the Wigmoor Farm Landfill, Bishops Cleeve and available site monitoring16\ndata (Applied Environmental Research Centre, 2001). These simplifications also mask an17\nimportant reality that source term generation at operational waste management facilities is18\nmostly episodic and short-term, consistent with operational cycles. Thus, comparing19\naveraged concentrations to long term air quality standards, therefore, must be undertaken20\nwith caution.21\n22\n2.2.3 Estimating dust emissions using AERMOD23\nAERMOD, the American Meteorology Society-Environmental Protection Agency24\nRegulatory Model, is a stationary new generation dispersion model designed to predict25\n8pollutant concentrations from continuous point, flare, area, line, and volume sources.1\nTerrain effect was modelled and dust deposition was predicted at selected receptor locations2\ndownwind of the landfill site (Table 7). Concentrations were compared, where available, to3\nthe statutory UK air quality objectives (Table 7) and, for PM10, to background concentrations4\nat the nearest automatic monitoring network location (Table 8).5\nAmenity impacts from waste management activities are of increasing interest. The6\nlower nuisance threshold for dust deposition is often taken to be 200-350 mg\/m2\/d averaged7\nover a month (Anon, 1986; Bate and Coppin, 1990; North Ayrshire Council, 2000), with a8\n\u2018likely nuisance\u2019 level of 650 mg\/m2\/d. Here, the lower threshold was used as a criterion for9\nassessing the nuisance potential of APC deposition rates (Table 9).10\n11\n2.3 Generic risk assessment - indirect exposures through ingestion and consumption12\nWhilst inhalation offers a direct route of exposure for airborne dust, indirect13\nexposures may also occur through the deposition and subsequent uptake of contaminants14\nfrom the soil (Harrop and Pollard, 1998). Here, the Contaminated Land Exposure15\nAssessment (CLEA) (Environment Agency and Defra, 2002) model was used to estimate16\nindirect exposures to key contaminants in APC residues deposited at receptor locations17\ndownwind of disposal sites. CLEA has been developed to generate generic soils guideline18\nvalues for contaminated land in the UK. Information can, however, be incorporated into the19\nmodel to inform estimates of exposure from more specific circumstances; for example, the20\nconsumption of allotment grown vegetables. CLEA was employed to estimate daily intakes21\nfor receptors of concern (e.g. a local child) and exposure estimates for evaluating the22\nsignificance of potential risks to human health.23\nThe CLEA model consists of a number of generic fate and transport algorithms that24\nare normally reviewed and adapted, where necessary, to the requirements of a specific25\n9compound before the soil guideline value is produced. Whilst this process has been carried1\nout for the metals (lead, cadmium, chromium and arsenic), this is not the case for dioxins and2\nfurans. Hence, the model has not been properly validated for dioxins and the results should3\ntherefore be treated with caution. CLEA does not allow consideration of a source term4\nincreasing over time (such as annual deposition for a number of years) nor take account of5\nchanging fluxes in the source term. Further, at present, a critical pathway, the deposition of6\nparticulates on the leaves of fruit and vegetables, was not modelled in this screening assessment.7\nA number of critical adaptations and assumptions were therefore required:8\n(i) it was assumed that deposition occurs at a constant annual rate and that deposited9\ndust is mixed evenly into the top 0.1m of the soil;10\n(ii) a 6-year deposition period was assumed with the concentration at the end of the sixth11\nyear being assumed to have been present from the start. This is a conservative12\nassumption and consistent with the exposure duration used in CLEA to assess risks13\nto children from exposure to soil contamination;14\n(iii) local onward mobilisation of contaminated dusts was assumed to be negligible15\ncompared to the primary flux to the site and the relative contribution from other16\nexposure pathways such as ingestion;17\n(iv) the most sensitive receptor and standard land-use was considered to be a female18\nchild aged 0-6 in a residential setting where the family consumes its own19\nhomegrown produce.20\n21\n3. Results and discussion22\n3.1 Generic risk screening23\nFrom 31 potential pollutant linkages identified from the prior literature, reports and24\nthrough initial interviews with Agency staff in the risk screening stage, seven were assessed25\n10\nas key, with risk rankings of medium or high (Table 4). These were used as the basis for1\nundertaking the site \u2013specific assessment.2\n3\n3.2 Generic risk assessment \u2013 inhalation of dusts4\nApplication of the key generic linkages (Table 4) within a site-specific context by5\nregulatory staff resulted in only four of the six sites being considered for site-specific6\nassessment (Table 7). Two sites, Meece and Himleywood, had APC residues delivered and7\ndisposed of in sealed nylon bags with the reasonable presumption that a negligible probability8\nof exposure to nearby human receptors existed.9\n10\n3.2.1 Simple dust blow model11\nThe emission rates in Table 6 were associated with wind erosion from APC residues12\nin the case where recently deposited waste piles were periodically spread to form an even13\nlayer. These were in agreement with previously reported studies on the transport of APC14\nresidues from landfill sites (AERC, 2001). Through sensitivity testing with the SDBM (not15\npresented here for brevity), it was established that:16\n(i) the particle sizes of the APC residues released from the landfill sites determine, in17\npart, the distance the particles will travel;18\n(ii) moisture contents less than 20%w\/w result in increased dust release;19\n(iii) wind speeds greater than 6m\/s are needed for significant erosion of dusts from20\nactive landfill cells; and21\n(iv) vehicle movements across bare APC residue leads to increased dust release.22\nThe main uncertainties in the model are the source terms describing the amount of material23\nbecoming airborne and the size distribution of these particles. The source terms used were24\nconservative and did not allow for rainfall that would contribute to dust suppression.25\n11\n1\n2\n12\n3.2.2 AERMOD dispersion of APC residues1\nData from the AERMOD air dispersion modelling are presented in Table 7. The air2\nquality standards or objective were not exceeded at any human receptor for any of the landfill3\nsites studied (using 1997 meteorological data) based on the site-specific emissions rates.4\nAdditional analysis using meteorological data from 1995, 1996 and 1997 indicated pollutant5\nconcentrations typically <10% of the air quality strategy objectives at the 90th percentile.6\nUsing a reasonable worst case scenario of two source areas of 14 560 m2 (88m x 145m and7\n40m x 45m) emitting 1000 mg APC residue\/m2\/d, the PM10 air quality objective was not8\nexceeded. Predicted PM10 concentrations in Table 7 were, at maximum, ca.10% of the9\nmeasured annual mean background PM10 concentrations close to these sites (Table 8).10\n11\n3.3 Generic risk assessment \u2013 indirect exposures12\nDeposition data for APC residues in soils are presented in Table 9. For Pb, Cd, As and13\nCrVI, volume averaged soil concentrations are very low. Assuming a uniform mixing of APC14\nresidues in the top 0.1 m of soil for six years resulted in concentrations for most contaminants of15\n< 1 mg\/kg, and in many cases, < 100 \uf06dg\/kg. The estimated soil concentrations for the site with16\nthe highest predicted deposition rates are presented in Table 10. The highest soil concentration17\nis for Pb at ca. 15 mg\/kg and this can be compared with typical soil lead concentration of18\nbetween 10\u201330 mg\/kg in many areas of the UK (Davis, 1995).19\nComparison of these modelled metals concentrations to UK soil guideline values20\nindicate that these concentrations would not present regulatory concern with respect to risks to21\nhuman health. For the highest deposition rates, in excess of 100 years\u2019 deposition would be22\nrequired for Pb and Cd and more than 1000 years for As and CrVI for concentrations to meet the23\nsoil guideline values. This said, two issues warrant further consideration. The calculations24\nabove, for a hypothetical site, assume that the soil is not already contaminated with metals found25\n13\nin the APC residues. It might be the case that background or point-source contamination of the1\nsoil could be close to, or above the levels indicated by the soil guideline values, in which case2\nfurther deposition of dust may be more significant. In addition, both As and Pb are considered3\nto be non-threshold substances by the UK Department of Health under which concentrations in4\nsoil are subject to ALARP risk management principles where even small additions to the soil5\nmust be considered by reference to the cost and benefits of control.6\nIn the case of dioxins (expressed in terms of 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxic equivalents;7\nTEQs), CLEA was used to assess exposure at Glebe Farm (Table 10). The CLEA model has8\nnot been externally validated for dioxins. The results are tentative and demand qualification.9\nThe estimated soil concentration for the highest deposition rate was 8 ng TEQ\/kg of soil. This10\nis within the typical mean soil concentration of 3 to 23 ng TEQ\/kg reported in the UK and11\nelsewhere for PCDD\/PCDFs in rural and urban soils (Duarte-Davidson et al., 1997). The12\naverage daily human exposure (ADE) to the critical receptor was estimated to be 0.8 pg13\nTEQ\/kg bw\/day, which is twice the health criteria value derived for dioxins (0.4 pg TEQ\/kg14\nbw day; Defra and Environment Agency, 2003). Based on this initial assessment, it would be15\nuseful to explore this exposure assessment further using more realistic parameters and to16\nrefine the CLEA model to allow for the derivation of soil guideline values for PCDD\/PCDFs17\nand this is currently under consideration.18\n19\n3.4 Key limitations and uncertainties20\nAn exposure assessment was undertaken for a representative number of sites using a21\nlimited data set. There are a number of uncertainties that affect the results of any such22\nassessment and these could lead to a larger or smaller risk of exposure. The results presented23\nhere can only be described as an indication of the likely risks posed by the contamination.24\nFurther sampling, analysis, and a more detailed risk assessment would increase the25\n14\nconfidence in these results. However, the assumptions underlying exposure assessment were1\ncarefully selected, making it necessarily conservative at this stage. A number of important2\nuncertainties that need to be considered when considering the outcome of this study:3\n(i) Source term considerations \u2013 estimating the mass of APC residue likely to be lost4\nfrom the site has large levels of uncertainty associated with it. The main5\ncontributors to the source term are included and are hypothetically large and6\ndesigned to incorporate smaller non-quantifiable sources.7\n(ii) Dispersion and indirect exposure modelling \u2013 modelling is reliant on the quality8\nand quantity of the data supplied. Key parameters have been estimated and would9\nneed to be refined to reduce uncertainties associated with the estimates. A10\nconservative approach was taken to counter these uncertainties.11\n(iii) Contaminants assessed \u2013 only a few selected contaminants were assessed. These12\nwere selected on the basis of concentrations reported in APC residues and the13\nhealth effects that might result from exposure to these contaminants. The reported14\nTEQ levels, for example, only account for dioxins and furans. The contribution of15\ndioxin-like PCBs was not considered. If incorporated, this would lead to a higher16\nTEQ daily intake than that estimated here. Similarly only those metals deemed17\nhazardous to human health were assessed.18\n(iv) Exposure dynamics - the CLEA model does not allow any consideration of a soil19\nsource term that is increasing over time (such as continuation of annual deposition20\nfor a number of years) nor does it take account of changing fluxes in this source21\nterm. CLEA is designed to deal with the risk posed by historical soil22\ncontamination.23\n24\n25\n15\n4. Conclusions1\nA generic risk-screening approach was developed for the potential pollutant linkages2\nthat exist at landfill sites accepting APC residues. Potential exposures were modelled using3\ndata from the literature, not site monitoring data. The results provide an indication of the4\nrelative magnitude of the risks posed. They are generic, and do not reflect all exposure5\ncircumstances at all locations. The following conclusions demand qualification given the6\nassumptions adopted.7\n1. Seven important pollutant linkages were identified with medium and high risk to8\nhuman health. These considered the atmospheric transport and subsequent direct and9\nindirect exposure to nearby workers and residents. The key pollutant linkages were10\npotentially present at 4 of the 6 landfill sites studied.11\n2. Direct exposure through ingestion and inhalation are the critical exposure pathways.12\n3. Dust does not appear to be of major concern give the deposition rates modelled.13\nHowever, it would be prudent to control dust release through the enforcement of14\ncontrol measures in the permit conditions and working plans.15\n4. The main APC landfill site (> 40% of the total APC residues disposed in 2000-1) was16\nfound not to cause significant release of APC residues that reached the nearby17\nreceptors. The predicted annual mean of PM10 at the nearest sensitive human receptor18\nwas 1.8 \u00b5g\/m3, significantly lower than the air quality strategy objective of 40 \u00b5g\/m3.19\n5. The long term accumulation of dioxins from deposited dust are tentative and warrant20\nfurther study. Indications in this work are that indirect exposures require more21\ndetailed investigation.22\n6. On the basis of this preliminary analysis, the disposal of APC residues at landfill sites23\ndoes not appear to pose significant harm to nearby human receptors. However, this24\n16\nassessment was made using a restricted data set and more information is required to1\nfully understand the nature of the hazard.2\n7. Future work will have the opportunity to utilise updated research on APC residues3\nand their characteristics (WRc, 2004).4\n5\nAcknowledgements6\nThe authors are grateful to the Environment Agency for permission to publish.

Information on generic APC disposal practice pertinent to qualitative risk1\nassessment including that summarised in Environment Agency (2002)2\n3\nA. Source of hazard\nAPC residues are transferred from incinerators to treatment sites and treated before final disposal at\nlicensed landfill sites, the treatment site may or may not be in the same location as the landfill site.\nTreatment of APC residues varies with location. Treatment involves the controlled mixing of the APC\nresidues with a variety of waste liquids, including landfill leachates and industrial waste fluids.\nTo reduce the source of the hazard \u2018ordinary control procedures\u2019 are required, for example use of daily and\nintermediate cover.\nAssessment of the source needs to include all potential dust releasing operations and scenarios where\nemissions can take place, for example, disposal of APC residue to a raised void will increase potential for\nwind erosion of material.\nB. Hazard\nAPC residues are potentially hazardous due to their: high pH (pH 11-12.5); high levels of PCDD\/F 2500 ng\nI-TEQ \/ kg; Pb 5000 mg\/kg; Cd 250 mg\/kg; As 200 mg\/kg; and Cr (vi) 116 mg\/kg) (maximum\nconcentrations taken from analysis).\nAPC residues are \u2018dust like\u2019 due to their particulate nature with small diameters (<100 \u00b5m), with the\npotential for atmospheric transport under energetic conditions. Data from one analysis indicates that 100%\nof APC residues were smaller than 63\u00b5m, with 50% smaller than 12\u00b5m.\nWaste Management Licence may have protocols for sampling APC residues and determining their chemical\ncontent, this should be carried out by the producer of the waste disposal site.\nC. Transport mechanisms\nPotential sources for atmospheric APC residue release, include: accidental release from APC residue\ndelivery vehicles; waste transfer stations; loading waste treatment silos; loading open dumper trucks;\ntransfer to active landfill cells; and activities at active landfill cell.\nAvailable evidence suggests that dioxins have low volatility [some dioxins, i.e. the lower chlorinated ones\nare semi-volatile] to undergo appreciable evaporation from ash disposal sites.\nThe potential and extent of any dust release is based on the amount of APC residues being disposed and the\nmethod of disposal.\nDepending on whether the APC residues are mono- or co-disposed influences the potential for the transport\nof APC residues off site. Co-disposed APC residues tend to be covered daily. Mono-disposal sites may not\nuse daily cover.\nD. Pathways\nAtmospheric transport of dusts is the main potential pathway for identified hazards reaching a nearby\nhuman receptor.\nAppreciable exposure only likely to occur when a young child is present on the site, perimeter fences\nshould mitigate against this.\nLeachates recirculated or collected for off-site disposal.\nAll potential exposure pathways need to be included in risk assessments.\nE. Targets \/ receptors and exposure\nRisk assessments and licence conditions need to include fundamental aspects of current operations and\nmonitoring programme e.g. they need to include dust sources other than active cell and minimum moisture\ncontent of 20%.\nPredicted APC deposition rates are well below nuisance threshold quotes for all receptors at Wingmoor\nFarm landfill site.\nUse of \u2018more realistic\u2019 scenarios in applicants risk assessment, may not be conservative enough. Evidence\nis needed that these accurately represent the operations of the site.\nDispersion modelling based on a Gaussian decay curve indicate an approximately 100-fold reduction in\ndust levels over the minimum distances between the tipping face and the perimeter of the site.\n4\n5\n23\nTable 3.

Assumes child as most\nsensitive human receptor.\nSevere: there is sufficient evidence that short- or long-term exposure to chemical may result in serious damage to health (e.g. death, clear functional disturbance or morphological changes which are\ntoxicologically significant). Latency of effect and irreversibility (during or following exposure) should be considered here; moderate: there is sufficient evidence that exposure to chemical may result in\nhealth effects that are not severe in nature and are reversible once exposure ceases (e.g. irritant); mild: health effect not apparent though chemical exerts reversible physiological and\/or pathological changes\n(e.g. biochemical, haematological changes or enzyme induction but no other apparent effect); negligible: no evidence of adverse health effects and\/or physiological and pathological effects following\nexposure to chemical.\n3 Qualitative evaluation of the significance of the risk\nDetermined by combining the probability of the consequences (i.e. probability of (a) the hazard occurring; (b) the receptor being exposed to the hazard and (c) harm resulting from that hazard) and the\nmagnitude of the consequences.\nTable 5.
