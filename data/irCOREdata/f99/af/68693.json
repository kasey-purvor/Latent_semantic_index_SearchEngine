Introduction\n[2] Pulsations in the precipitation of energetic electrons\n(>30 keV) have long been observed in cosmic noise absorp-\ntion (CNA). These pulsations often appear in the measure-\nments of relative ionospheric opacity meters (riometers)\nand are generally linked to the occurrence of standing mag-\nnetospheric Alfv\u00e9n waves, known as field line resonances\n(FLR) [e.g., Spanswick et al., 2005]. This is not the sole\nsource of these pulsations; Senior and Honary [2003] iden-\ntified a westward propagating wave in the Imaging Riometer\nfor Ionospheric Studies (IRIS), which they attributed to\nmodulation via a drift or drift\u2010bounce resonant wave.\n[3] The variations in D region electron densities caused by\nprecipitating electron pulsations have also been observed\nwith ionospheric radar. Yeoman and Wright [2000] con-\nducted a detailed case study of an event on 18 October\n1999, with the CUTLASS HF radars. Three distinct waves\nwere identified. The first had a large\u2010scale nature, suggest-\ning a driving source external to the magnetosphere, whereas\nthe second and third had smaller azimuthal scale lengths,\nsuggestive of an internal driving mechanism.\n[4] Occurring almost exclusively during the morning and\nearly afternoon, eastward propagating waves with high azi-\nmuthal wave numbers are an interesting, yet common, sub-\nset of CNA pulsation.\n[5] Kikuchi [1988] used a scanning beam riometer to mea-\nsure the period and velocity of 19 such waves. He reported\nthat this newly discovered type of pulsation occurred\nbetween 5 and 10 magnetic local time (MLT) and had a\nshort azimuthal wavelength, corresponding to an m number\nof 20\u2013180. The eastward direction led him to conclude\n\u201cthe primary source must be located in the nightside\nmagnetosphere.\u201d\n[6] It is possible to classify magnetospheric ULF waves\naccording to their mode of propagation. Shear Alfv\u00e9n waves\npropagate along field lines, reflected by the high conductivity\nionosphere in the northern and southern hemispheres,\nwhereas compressional fast mode waves propagate perpen-\ndicular to the magnetic field, reflected by the low latitude\nionosphere and an outer boundary, usually taken to be the\nmagnetopause.\n[7] Standing waves of each type resonate at eigenfrequen-\ncies dependent on the wave speed and the length of the field\nline or size of the cavity. The theory of standing Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves, or field line resonance, is well known and has been\nused extensively to explain geomagnetic pulsation observa-\ntions and to infer plasma density along field lines.\n[8] It is accepted that cavity modes excite toroidal Alfv\u00e9n\nwaves, with particularly strong coupling where the compres-\nsional wave frequency matches the natural resonance of the\nfield line. This is an important process in the generation\nmechanism we propose for high m number waves, and in\nsection 3.2 we employ a simple box model of the dayside\nmagnetosphere to help qualitatively describe the coupling.\nToroidal Alfv\u00e9n modes are capable of energy exchange with\nthe magnetospheric charged particle population, through\nLandau and inverse\u2010Landau damping of particles close to\ndrift\u2010bounce resonance.\n[9] The Advanced Rio\u2010Imaging Experiment in Scandina-\nvia (ARIES) is a new type of imaging riometer with a spatial\nresolution of less than 10 km at zenith and over 500 individ-\nual beams. It has provided the greatest imaging resolution of\nany riometer to date and facilitated the identification of a\nlarge number of high m number waves within a single\n6\u2010month period.\n[10] For the first time, a complete generating mechanism\nfor these waves is described, beginning with a source exter-\nnal to the magnetosphere and ultimately resulting in the\nobserved structured cosmic noise absorption.

Instruments\n2.1. ARIES\n[11] ARIES [Grill et al., 2003] was the first of its kind, a\nrelative ionospheric opacity meter (riometer) based around\na Mills Cross antenna array. This configuration achieves a\nfourfold increase in spacial resolution when compared with\nother imaging riometers with the same number of antennas.\nARIES receives at 38.2 MHz and uses a Field Programma-\nble Gate Array (FPGA) to conduct beam forming entirely in\nthe digital domain. The angular resolution reaches a maxi-\nmum of 4.75\u00b0 at zenith. It is located near Ramfjordmoen,\nNorway (69.63\u00b0N, 19.52\u00b0E).\n2.2. CAMMICE (POLAR)\n[12] The Charge And Mass Magnetospheric Ion Composi-\ntion Experiment (CAMMICE), aboard the Polar spacecraft\n[Acu\u00f1a et al., 1995], provided energetic particle composi-\ntion data from two instruments. The data set utilized in this\nstudy is from the Double Coincidence Rate (DCR) channel\nof the Magnetospheric Ion Composition Sensor (MICS)\n[Wilken et al., 1992]. The DCR channel responded mainly\nto the dominant proton species, with energy bins spaced log-\narithmically between 1 and 328 keV and a spin averaged\ntemporal resolution of 192 s. Prior to its end of life in\n2008, Polar was in a 1.8 \u00d7 9 RE polar orbit, with an \u224886\u00b0\ninclination to the equator. Its spin was stabilized perpendic-\nular to the orbital plane, with a period of 6 s.\n3. Theory\n3.1. Generation Mechanism Overview\n[13] We propose a generation mechanism of high azi-\nmuthal wave number waves, which can be broken down into\nfive steps as shown in Figure 1.\n[14] Solar wind pressure pulses on the dayside magneto-\npause excite quantized standing waves in the magnetospheric\ncavity. These compressional modes couple to toroidal Alfv\u00e9n\nfield line oscillations, which share the low azimuthal wave\nnumbers of the cavity modes.\n[15] Drift\u2010bouncing magnetospheric protons are accelerat-\ned by the toroidal waves though Landau damping, causing a\nbump to appear on the tail of the proton energy distribution.\nFollowing a reduction of the initial driving wave, this free\nenergy becomes unstable to inverse\u2010Landau damping, and\na secondary toroidal wave is generated.\n[16] The energy of a proton in resonance with a wave is\ndetermined by both the frequency and the azimuthal wave\nnumber of the wave. As a consequence, secondary waves\ntake a range of frequencies and azimuthal wave numbers,\nwhile obeying a dispersion relation determined by the pro-\nton energy. Distinctive, high azimuthal wave numbers are\noften observed.\n[17] By modulating the growth of whistler mode waves\nand, subsequently, the pitch angle scattering of electrons\ninto the loss cone [Coroniti and Kennel, 1970], images\nof these ULF waves appear in the cosmic noise absorption\nmeasured by riometers.\n3.2. Magnetospheric Cavity Modes\n[18] To describe the magnetospheric cavity modes and\ncoupled field line resonances, we follow the method of\nCheng et al. [1998] by solving the linearized ideal MHD\nwave equation in simple Cartesian coordinates. X represents\nthe radial distance and Y the azimuthal distance, with posi-\ntive Y toward dusk. The Z direction follows the magnetic\nfield, from the South to the North Pole:\nd2E1\ndt2\n\u00bc 1\n\u00010\u00030\n\u0002 r\u0003 r\u0003 E1\u00f0 \u00de\u0003 B0\u0003 B0 \u00fe r\u0003 B0\u00f0 \u00de\u0003 r\u0003 E1\u00f0 \u00de\u0003 B0\u00bd \u0004;\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere B0 is the ambient magnetic field, r0 the ambient plas-\nma density, and E1 the electric field perturbation.\n[19] In ideal MHD there is no electric field component\nalong the magnetic field. E1 may therefore be described by\nE1 \u00bc E1X X\u00f0 \u00de;E1Y X\u00f0 \u00de; 0\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 exp i kY Y \u00fe kZZ \u0005 !t\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u0004; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere kY and kZ are the wave numbers in the Y and Z direc-\ntions, respectively.\n[20] In order to explore standing wave modes, equation (1)\nis decomposed into two steady state differential equations:\nthe first to be solved for E1Y and the second giving E1X:\nd2E1Y\ndX 2\n\u00fe 2k\n2\nY!\n2 dvA\ndX\n\u0001 \u0003\n!2\nv2A\n\u0005 k2Z\n\u0004 \u0005\n!2\nv2A\n\u0005 k2Z \u0005 k2Y\n\u0004 \u0005\nv3A\n\u00fe 1\nB0\ndB0\ndX\n8<\n:\n9=\n; dE1YdX\n\u00fe !\n2\nv2A\n\u0005 k2Z \u0005 k2Y\n\u0006 \u0007\nE1Y \u00bc 0;\n\u00f03\u00de\nE1X \u00bc\nikY\ndE1Y\ndX\n!2\nv2A\n\u0005 k2Z \u0005 k2Y\n\u0004 \u0005 ; \u00f04\u00de\nFigure 1. An overview of the proposed generationmechanism.\nBEHARRELL ET AL.: ORIGIN OF HIGH m WAVES A02201A02201\n2 of 12\nwhere vA = B0\/(RE\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\u00010\u00030\np\n) is the Alfv\u00e9n speed in Earth radii\nper second. In Cartesian coordinates, kY is equivalent to the\nazimuthal m number. All distances are in Earth radii (RE),\nwave numbers are in radiansRE\n\u22121, and speeds are in RE s\n\u22121.\nIn order to avoid a problematic singularity in (3) and (4)\nat w2\/vA\n2 \u2212 kZ2 \u2212 kY2 = 0, the angular wave frequency w is given\nan imaginary component. The negative damping factor g =\n=(w)\/<(w) represents an irreversible loss of energy to the\ncoupled field line resonances. The effect of this damping\nis to broaden a field line resonance without altering its loca-\ntion. The value of kZ is taken to be n \u00b7 p\/5, where n = 1, 2, 3,\n\u2026 and 5 is the normalized length of the field lines, follow-\ning Cheng et al. [1998].\n[21] After solving equations (3) and (4), the magnetic field\nperturbation is found using the Maxwell\u2010Faraday equation:\nr\u0003 E1 \u00bc \u0005 @B1\n@t\n: \u00f05\u00de\n[22] Thus, the magnetic field perturbation in the X direc-\ntion is proportional to the electric field perturbation in the\nY direction and vice versa.\n[23] A numerical solution is presented in Figure 2, for\nmagnetic field corresponding to the equatorial plane of a\ndipole (B0 \/ 1\/X3), with the adjustable Alfv\u00e9n speed profile\nutilized by Cheng et al. [1998], shown in Figure 3. The\nparameter values used in this solution are P = 4.7, Q =\n4.7, R = 7.37, vA0 = 0.0387, with w = 16 \u00d7 10\n\u22123 \u00b7 2p, g =\n\u22120.0022, kZ = 2 \u00b7 p\/5, and kY = 0.5. The Alfv\u00e9n speed at the\nplasmapause, vA0, and the parameter R, have been chosen\nsuch that an 8 mHz field line resonance will occur at\n6.18 RE, in accordance with observations of phase reversal\nin magnetometer data [Menk et al., 2001].\n[24] Without azimuthal boundaries the choice of kY seems\narbitrary and, in reality, would be determined by the propa-\ngation of a solar wind pressure front along the magneto-\npause. Here we have chosen a value of 0.5 radians RE\n\u22121,\nequivalent to an m number of 3.5 at X = 7 RE, which is\nnot unreasonable.\n[25] At the magnetopause the boundary conditions require\nthat the electric field, and therefore the magnetic field per-\nturbations in the X and Y directions, are zero. However,\nB1Z, representing equatorially symmetric compressions and\nrarefactions of the magnetic field, is not zero. This is the\nmeans of energy transfer from solar wind pressure variations\nto the cavity mode waves.\n[26] In the WKB approximation, (w2\/vA\n2 \u2212 kZ2 \u2212 kY2)1\/2 can\nbe thought of as the variable wave number kX(X). A turning\npoint, XT, is found in B1X, where kX(X) = 0. In our solution\nXT = 6.65. Earthward of this point the cavity mode decays\nbefore resonance with field line oscillations occur at XR.\nAcross the field line resonance, which is centered on kZ =\nw\/vA, there is a phase reversal in the toroidal component,\nB1Y.\n[27] Beyond XR the cavity mode continues to decay until a\nsecond turning point is met. For an Alfv\u00e9n speed profile\nproportional to 1\/X, the second turning point is located at\nXT\/\nffiffiffi\n2, where kX(X) = iw\/vA. In the absence of a plasma-\npause all three components have local minimum at the second\nturning point, where B1Y and B1Z are zero, but B1X is non\u2010zero\nand finite. Here, the magnetospheric cavity mode can effi-\nciently couple to that of the plasmaspheric cavity, at the plas-\nmapause, XPP. The solution within the plasmaspheric cavity\nhas an antinode in B1X and nodes in B1Y and B1Z at the plas-\nmapause, where neglecting damping kX(X) is once again real\ndue to the lower Alfv\u00e9n speed.\n[28] The distance from, for example, the turning point XT\nto the closest possible position of the magnetopause XMP\nmay be estimated using the phase integral equation:\n\u0004n \u00bc\nZ XMP\nXT\nkX X\u00f0 \u00de dX \u0005 l \u0005 1=4\u00f0 \u00de\u0005 \u00bc 0; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere l is an integer.\n[29] When the azimuthal wave number is not exactly zero,\ntime independent solutions are available only for a plasma-\npause of zero thickness, indicating that a thin plasmapause is\nimportant for standing wave longevity in the combined plas-\nmaspheric and magnetospheric cavity. Satellite observations\n[e.g., Chappell et al., 1970] have shown that, during high ap\nindex, the plasmapause is characterized by a fall in ion den-\nsity of approximately three orders of magnitude in as little as\n0.2 RE. At low ap index the same ion density change typi-\ncally occurs over a radial distance exceeding 1 RE. Thus,\nwe may expect that events are more likely at times of high\nap index.\n[30] The plasma density and the azimuthal wave number\nkY combine to determine a location of the second turning\nFigure 2. A time independent solution of the ideal MHD\nwave equation, for a frequency of 16 mHz, with n = 2.\nMagnetic field perturbations are shown in the X (solid)\nand Z (dashed) directions.\nFigure 3. The adjustable Alfv\u00e9n speed profile. Shown with\nR = 9, P = 5, and Q = 6. P and Q define the plasmapause,\nwhile vA0 is the Alfv\u00e9n speed at P.\nBEHARRELL ET AL.: ORIGIN OF HIGH m WAVES A02201A02201\n3 of 12\npoint in the magnetosphere that matches the location of the\nplasmapause. The magnetospheric plasma density, azimuthal\nwave number and plasmapause location have unique relation-\nships with activity and local time. It is therefore expected that\nthere will be a geomagnetic\/solar activity dependence on the\nMLT of high m number observations. However, in order to\nestablish relationships between such variables it would be\nnecessary to abandon the Cartesian model, and fixed wave\nnumbers, in favor of a more realistic geometry, which is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n[31] In summary, the simple box model provides estimates\nof the L\u2010shell of phase\u2010reversal for each cavity mode har-\nmonic (utilized in section 4.2), predicts enhanced occurrence\nrates for a thin plasmapause, indicated by a high ap index,\nand predicts that there is likely to be an activity dependence\non the MLT of events (explored in section 4.3).\n3.3. Particle\u2010Wave Resonance\n[32] A charged particle drift\u2010bouncing in the magneto-\nsphere is able to resonate with a toroidal MHD wave when\nthe resonance condition is met:\n!\u0005 m!d \u00bc N!b \u00f07\u00de\n[Southwood et al., 1969], where m is the azimuthal wave\nnumber, w is the angular frequency of the wave, and wd\nand wb are the drift and bounce angular frequencies of the\nparticle, respectively. N is the resonance order, an integer\nthat may be positive, negative, or zero. A graphical repre-\nsentation of the resonance condition is given in Figure 4.\nFigures 4a, 4b, and 4c show the trajectories of an ion in res-\nonance with the N = 0, 1, and 2 modes, respectively, in the\nrest frame of the wave.\n[33] In a process known as Landau damping, drift\u2010bouncing\ncharged particles with slightly less energy than required for\nresonance will take energy from the wave, regardless of the\ndirection of their motion around Earth. Conversely, in in-\nverse\u2010Landau damping, particles with slightly more energy\nthan required for resonance will transfer energy to the\nwave.\n[34] Theprotondrift [Chisham, 1996] andbounce [Glassmeier\net al., 1999] angular frequencies, in the Earth\u2019s rotating\nreference frame, are\n!d \u00bc EL\n2\nBsRE\n\u0005 6WL 0:35\u00fe 0:15 sin \u0006\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\nBsR2E\n; \u00f08\u00de\n!b \u00bc \u0005\nffiffiffiffiffi\nW\npffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2mp\np\nLRE 1:3\u0005 0:56 sin \u0006\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\n; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere L is the L\u2010shell of the proton and W is its energy\nin eV, BS is the equatorial magnetic field strength at the\nsurface of Earth, a is the equatorial pitch angle of the\nproton, E is the magnetospheric electric field and mp is\nthe proton mass.\n[35] We are concerned with resonance at the L value of the\nARIES riometer, near geosynchronous orbit. Here, following\nBaddeley et al. [2002], equations (8) and (9) reduce to\n!d \u0006 C1 \u00fe C2W ; \u00f010\u00de\n!b \u0006\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nC3W\np\n; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere C1 = 7.7 \u00d7 10\n\u22126, C2 = \u22121.44 \u00d7 10\u22128, and C3 =\n2.89 \u00d7 10\u22127.\n3.4. Combining Landau and Inverse\u2010Landau Damping\n[36] Protons accelerated by Landau damping will form a\nbump on the tail of their energy distribution functions.\nWhen the driving wave ceases, the bump\u2010on\u2010tail energy\nFigure 4.

Combining\nequations (7)\u2013(9), we find that a secondary wave has one of\ntwo degrees of freedom determined by the energy of the\nbump\u2010on\u2010tail particles; that is, the wave frequency and m\nnumber of a secondary wave are not fixed, but are dependent.\n[37] For any particular frequency and m number of a driv-\ning wave, there will be a linear relationship between fre-\nquency and m number of all possible secondary waves.\nConsidering equation (7), for both a driving and secondary\nwave in resonance with a common ion energy, we obtain the\ngeneral linear relation\n!S \u00bc mS !d \u00fe NSND !D \u0005 mD !d\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere the D and S subscripts refer to the driving and sec-\nondary waves, respectively. If the properties of the driving\nwave are known, the proton angular drift frequency, wd,\nmay be determined using equations (7)\u2013(9) and substituted\ninto equation (12) to reveal the possible parameters of a\nsecondary wave. Thus, at geosynchronous orbit,\n!S \u00bc mSmD !D \u00fe\nmS\nmD\nND \u0005 NS\n\u0006 \u0007\n\u0003 NDC3\n2mDC2\n\u0005\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nNDC3\n2mDC2\n\u0006 \u00072\n\u0005C3\nC2\nC1 \u0005 !DmD\n\u0006 \u0007s24\n3\n5: \u00f013\u00de\n[38] On the basis of our hypothesis that many of the\nobserved high m number waves are a product of resonances,\ndriven by cavity\u2010like wave modes, we look at the case of a\nlarge scale, i.e., small m number, driving wave.

Resonance Orders\n[39] The resonance orders ND and NS are integers, includ-\ning negative values and zero. Since w and wb are by defini-\ntion positive, some values of N are not always possible,\ndepending on the azimuthal direction of the wave (positive\nor negative m) and the azimuthal drift direction of the\ncharged particle (positive or negative wd). Generally, smaller\nvalues of N produce more strongly coupled resonances, with\nN = 0 being the Cerenkov resonance. N must be nonzero and\npositive for eastward propagating MHD waves in resonance\nwith protons. This is also the case with cavity mode\u2010like\nwaves, where the low azimuthal wave numbers would\nrequire unrealistically high particle energies for N = 0.\nHowever, westward traveling waves may resonate with\nNS = \u2026, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, \u2026 and would therefore present a\nmore complicated picture.\n[40] It can be seen from Figure 4 that the shear Alfv\u00e9n\nharmonic n is related to the resonance order by n = N + 1.\nSince N = 1 is expected to be the strongest resonance for\ncavity mode waves, n = 2 is used in our model solution\n(section 3.2).\n3.6. Modulation of Precipitation\n[41] The capability of magnetospheric ULF waves to\nmodulate electron precipitation has been well established\nvia observation [e.g., Spanswick et al., 2005]. Coroniti\nand Kennel [1970] (see also Haugstad [1975]) suggested\nthat the magnetic pulsation modulates the growth rate of\nwhistler mode wave turbulence. Since these waves drive\npitch angle diffusion via Doppler\u2010shifter cyclotron reso-\nnance, the electron precipitation is modulated. Nos\u00e9 et al.\n[1998] offered an alternative mechanism whereby electrons\nare accelerated due to the parallel electric field of a kinetic\nAlfv\u00e9n wave. For this study the actual mechanism that oper-\nates is unimportant; it is enough that the modulation of elec-\ntron precipitation is occurring.\n4. ARIES Results\n[42] The times of all of the detected high m number wave\nevents are displayed in Figure 5. There is clearly a relation-\nship between solar wind activity and observations of high\nm number waves. Since they require a source of protons\nfor drift\u2010bounce resonance and electrons for precipitation,\nit is not unexpected that observations tend to occur follow-\ning substorm activity, when charged particles are drifting\ntoward the dayside magnetosphere. If high m waves are\nnot observed, it could be due to a lack of particles rather\nthan an indication that magnetic pulsations are absent.\n[43] In analyzing data from ARIES, cross\u2010power, the\nFourier transform of the cross\u2010correlation function, and\ncross\u2010phase, the frequency dependent phase difference,\nare calculated for pairs of equilatitudinal beams. The defini-\ntion of cross\u2010power is identical to the product of the two\nFourier transforms, where one of them has been complex\nconjugated. Forty\u2010two beam pairs located close to the zenith\nare employed.\n[44] Azimuthal wave numbers are determined from the\ncross\u2010phase and the known ARIES beam spacing, with an\nassumption that peak absorption is at an altitude of 90 km.\nResults from beam\u2010pairs are averaged to reduce error and\nsearched for wave\u2010like structures with frequencies between\n0.3 and 17 mHz. Neighboring beams are paired when ana-\nlyzing large m number events, whereas to improve accuracy\nneighbor\u2010but\u2010one beam pairs are chosen for m numbers\nbelow 250. ARIES is aligned geographically; although it is\nnot feasible to pair beams of the same geomagnetic latitude\nwithout severe aliasing due to a wide beam separation, the\neffect of this rotation is expected to be, at most, a few per-\ncent in the calculated m numbers.\n[45] Phase maps of two frequencies present during a typ-\nical event on 17 January 2007 are shown in Figure 6. These\nillustrate the relative phase of each beam, in radians, filtered\nat a specific frequency. The zero point is arbitrary. For the\nsame event, unfiltered data from five neighboring ARIES\nbeams and the X (north) components of two nearby magnet-\nometers are given in Figure 7. Clear phase differences are\nvisible across the ARIES beams. The magnetometers at\nTroms\u00f8 (69.66\u00b0N, 18.94\u00b0E) and Andenes (69.30\u00b0N, 16.03\u00b0E)\nare not capable of detecting waves with small spatial scales,\nas they effectively integrate over a wide area of sky; instead\nthey respond to a concurrent 7\u20138 mHz large\u2010scale wave,\nwhich is observed between 05:15 UT and 06:00 UT and\nthought to be the driver of the event. A similar integration\nBEHARRELL ET AL.: ORIGIN OF HIGH m WAVES A02201A02201\n5 of 12\neffect is seen in the westernmost riometer beam, where the\ndip in received power at 05:24 UT is smoothed due to the\nlarger beam size.\n4.1. Dispersion Relation of High m Number Waves\n[46] The dispersion relations of high m number waves\nobserved by ARIES between 7.5 and 14 MLT (Figure 8)\nhave distinct features consistent with secondary waves driven\nby large\u2010scale MHD waves through Landau followed by\ninverse\u2010Landau damping of the magnetospheric proton\npopulation, as described in section 3.4. All have ionospheric\nvelocities of less than 1 km s\u22121.\n[47] The frequency values of driving waves used in\nequation (14) for the calculation of the fitted lines are\nfD\/ND = 0.8, 8, 11.5, 16, 23, 30.5, 38.5 mHz. It is not possible\nto differentiate between resonance orders ND since it is the\nvalue of fD\/ND that determines the energy of the resonant\nprotons, and the dispersion relation of the secondary waves.\nThe same is not generally true of NS, for which there are\nevents of NS = 1 and NS = 2. Consequently, events asso-\nciated with fD\/ND = 8 and 11.5 mHz, for example, could be\n16 and 23 mHz cavity modes, respectively, with ND = 2.\n[48] Lower frequencies fD and higher resonance orders ND\nand NS are capable of producing higher m number secondary\nwaves. For an fD = 16 mHz driving wave, the ND 1 NS\n1 case may generate up to m \u223c 200 waves, whereas the ND\n2 NS 1 and ND 1 NS 2 cases are capable of producing waves\nof up to m \u223c 400. The highest m number observed (380) is\nattributed to ND 1 NS 2.\n[49] An m number of 380 corresponds to an azimuthal\nwavelength (lAz) of 697 km at geostationary orbit and\n37.4 km in the ionosphere above ARIES. Given the invari-\nance of v?\n2 \/B over the bounce period of a charged particle in\na dipole field, it can be shown that the ratio of the azimuthal\nwavelength to the Larmor radius (lAz\/r) is smallest in the\nequatorial plane. Drift\u2010bounce resonance, with N \u2260 0,\nstrongly favors particles of small equatorial pitch angle\n[Southwood and Kivelson, 1982; Baddeley et al., 2002].\nAssuming a pitch angle of 10\u00b0, for a resonant proton in\nthe m = 380 event, provides a ratio of lAz\/r \u224815, in the\nequatorial plane.\n[50] Three data points below 1 mHz do not appear to\nmatch the linear relations for cavity mode frequencies. It\ncould be that the same (Landau followed by inverse\u2010Landau\ndamping) mechanism is acting on a lower frequency group\nof magnetospheric waves, for example, the slow magnetoso-\nnic (SMS) oscillations described by Leonovich et al. [2006].\nThe SMS waves resonate with fundamental frequencies be-\ntween 0.1 and 1 mHz, and have amplitudes that fall rapidly\nupon approaching the ionosphere. This implies that the ion-\nosphere cannot absorb a significant amount of the wave\nenergy and led Leonovich et al. [2006] to conclude: \u201cSMS\nFigure 5. Occurrences of high azimuthal wave number (\u2223m\u2223 \u2265 60) events in ARIES, during the first\n6 months of 2007.\nBEHARRELL ET AL.: ORIGIN OF HIGH m WAVES A02201A02201\n6 of 12\nwave damping in the magnetosphere must be caused by other\nmechanisms, probably by their resonant interaction with the\nbackground plasma particles.\u201d Figure 8 includes a linear sec-\nondary wave function calculated for a 0.8 mHz large\u2010scale\ndriving wave. However, it should be noted that the fit of\nfew data points is improved following this inclusion.\n[51] Eastward high m wave events are observed in\nreduced numbers as early as 2.5 MLT, but those occurring\nbefore 7.5 MLT do not to fit the dispersion relation func-\ntions of the dayside events, and are excluded from Figure 8.\nThis is to be expected, due to the MLT variation in the size\nof the magnetospheric cavity away from the dayside, which\nalters the frequencies of cavity modes and, subsequently,\nthe dispersion relation functions. Additionally, pulsations\nin the flanks of the magnetosphere driven by the Kelvin\u2010\nHelmholtz instability are predicted to have similar frequen-\ncies (5\u201310 mHz), with varying m numbers (typically m \u223c 15)\n[Claudepierre et al., 2008]. If such waves are driving\nsources in the generation of high m waves, either by the\nmechanism under consideration or otherwise [e.g., Allan et\nal., 1997], evidence in the dispersion relations of any sec-\nondary waves will be difficult to find. Analysis is restricted\nto eastward waves observed around local noon, a stagnation\npoint for the solar wind, where velocity shear is minimized,\nand clear patterns in the dispersion relations are found. It\nshould be noted that although the waves have velocities in\nthe eastward direction, the events themselves do not propa-\nFigure 6. Phase maps of 17 January 2007 05:30 UT. (top) 3.2 mHz, m = 120.

The wave is generated and decays within a fixed MLT,\nevidenced by observations on successive days.\n4.2. Phase Reversal at Field Line Resonance\n[52] An event on 18 May 2007 (Figure 9) displays an ap-\nparent phase reversal between the northern and southern\nhalves of the ARIES field of view. This is especially clear\nin the east, where an imagined straight line following a\nnorthern crest would continue along a southern trough,\nand vice versa. Such a phase reversal is expected at\nthe L value of a field line resonance, theoretically (see\nsection 3.2), and as a well\u2010known feature of magnetometer\nFLR observations. Physically, it is interpreted as a reversal\nin the bouncing phase of resonant ions, spread over a finite\nradial distance due to damping and a finite electric field\nperturbation.\n[53] The frequency and azimuthal wave number of this\nevent suggest a cavity mode driving wave of fD\/ND =\n11.5 mHz, for which the box model calculation, calibrated\nby magnetometer FLR observation, predicts a phase reversal\ncentered at X = 6.44 RE. Using the Tsyganenko T01 model\n[Tsyganenko, 2002a, 2002b], with suitable inputs for the\ntime of the event, agreement is found in tracing the magnetic\nfield from the ionosphere directly above ARIES to an equa-\ntorial distance of 6.52 RE.\n4.3. Location of High m Number Waves\n[54] It was discussed in section 3.2 that cavity mode\nwaves depend on various magnetospheric parameters. Of\nparticular importance are likely to be the Alfv\u00e9n speed pro-\nfile, and the location and thickness of the plasmapause. In\nFigure 5, a correlation is found between times of enhanced\nap index and solar wind speed, and the observations of high\nm number events. Although this could be due to an increase\nin particle flux following substorm activity, a heightened ap\nindex is indicative of a thin plasmapause, conducive to the\nexistence of cavity modes. Furthermore, the events occur\nexclusively with ap \u2265 5, while between 1 January 2007\nand 30 June 2007, the period from which the data set is tak-\nen, 48.5% of ap values are below 5. This could be sugges-\ntive of a limit in plasmapause thickness, above which the\nmechanism cannot operate.\n[55] Following Chappell et al. [1970], a basic estimate for\nthe plasmapause location may be obtained from the maxi-\nmum ap index of the preceding 12 h. In Figure 10, the dis-\ntribution of the events in MLT is plotted against this\nestimated plasmapause location, for which a correlation is\nfound.\n[56] It is probable that the coherence of dayside cavity\nmode waves over a range of MLT is key in the formation\nof a significant bump on the tail of the proton energy distri-\nbution. High m number CNA pulsations with approximately\nidentical properties are often observed on consecutive days\nat the same MLT, indicating a long\u2010lived nature. In conjunc-\nFigure 7.

We can further speculate that\nbeyond the location of this threshold, the loss rate of\nbump\u2010on\u2010tail energy from the westward drifting proton dis-\ntribution to the modulated electron precipitation may deter-\nmine the local time extent of the pulsations.\n[57] In Figure 11a, the normalized power of detected\nwaves is given as a function of MLT, and in Figure 11b\nas a function of X, the radial distance in RE, traced for each\nevent along the magnetic field, using the Tsyganenko mag-\nnetic field model [Tsyganenko, 2002a, 2002b].

CAMMICE (MICS) Results\n[58] The proposed mechanism makes a testable prediction\nof the proton energy distribution in the dayside magneto-\nsphere. Positive gradient regions should commonly exist at\ndiscrete energy values corresponding to Landau damping\nof the magnetospheric cavity modes. These energy values\nare given in Table 1.\n[59] Previously, Baddeley et al. [2002] conducted a sur-\nvey of bumps\u2010on\u2010the\u2010tails of proton energy distributions\nnear geosynchronous orbit, using Polar CAMMICE data\nfrom 1996 through 2001. Positive gradient regions were\nfound to exist predominantly between 05 and 14 MLT, with\noccurrence rates peaking above 40%. The explanation of\nthis MLT distribution is quite straightforward: protons drift\nwestward from the nightside injection region; on reaching\nthe dayside magnetosphere, those near resonance are accel-\nerated by Landau damping of cavity mode waves. They con-\ntinue to drift westward into the morning sector, until the free\nenergy in the distribution is lost to the inverse\u2010Landau\ndamping of secondary MHD waves.\n[60] Figure 12 shows the occurrence rate of detected\nenhancements in the proton distribution function as a\nfunction of energy. The data are restricted to times when\nthe Polar spacecraft is located within L values of 5\u20139\nand MLT of 05\u201314.\n[61] The authors suspect that enhancements occupying\nsingle energy channels are being flagged as bad data during\nthe processing of CAMMICE data. Bad data values, for\nexample following a loss of synchronization, should be\nindependent of the ESA stepping pattern and therefore inde-\npendent of energy channel. However, cases in which single\nchannels are flagged are found to strongly favor those chan-\nnels closest to the expected energies of the fD\/ND = 11.5, 16\nand 23 mHz resonances. At lower energies, corresponding\nto fD\/ND = 8 mHz, enhancements occupy more than one\nof the logarithmically spaced energy channels and are more\nproperly detected as bumps in the energy distribution func-\ntion, seemingly unaffected by the CAMMICE quality con-\ntrol processing.\n[62] For this reason, flagged data are included as positive\ndetections of enhancements if the values in neighboring\nenergy channels are valid.\n[63] At energies above 70 keV, the widths of the energy\nchannels are significantly greater than their spacing, and\nthe detection of enhancements in the distribution becomes\nproblematic.\n6. Discussion and Conclusion\n[64] The primary result of this study is in the dispersion\nrelations of dayside, high m number, eastward propagating\nwaves (Figure 8). These show clear structure, matching well\nwith functions expected from cavity mode (i.e., large\u2010scale)\nsources, with frequencies of 8, 11.5, 16, 23, 30.5, and\n38.5 mHz. Several of these frequencies appear in previous\nstudies. Yumoto et al. [1994] reported global magnetometer\nobservations of cavity\u2010like oscillations at 15.5, 25, and\n31 mHz, following interplanetary impulses. Sibeck et al.\n[1989] observed ringing at a period of 2 min (8.3 mHz) in\nthe outer magnetospheric magnetic field, following a step\nfunction increase in solar wind pressure. Furthermore, quasi\u2010\nmonochromatic 2 min oscillations in the magnetic field, ion\nnumber density, temperature and velocity in the dawnside\nmagnetosphere have been encountered by the Equator\u2010S\nspacecraft [Rae et al., 2007].\n[65] Spectral analysis of ringing within a model magneto-\nsphere, following a solar wind pressure pulse [Lee et al.,\n2004], provided similar frequencies: 8, 16\u201323, 30, 40 mHz,\nand so on. Claudepierre et al. [2009] conducted global solar\nwind\u2010magnetosphere 3\u2010D MHD simulations and reported a\nfundamental cavity mode frequency close to 10 mHz,\nwhereas Fujita and Itonaga [2003] calculate an eigenmode\nfrequency of 14 mHz at dawn and 18 mHz at dusk, for\nresonance within the plasmaspheric cavity.\n[66] It becomes increasingly clear that the cavity mode\nfrequencies inferred herein are commonplace in the dayside\nmagnetosphere, with the probable exception of 11.5 mHz,\nwhich is taken to be the 23 mHz cavity mode, resonating\nwith ND = 2.\nTable 1.

There is a growing opinion that such fre-\nquencies are too small to be dayside magnetospheric cavity\nmodes, and may be forced oscillations at frequencies present\nin the solar wind [Leonovich and Mazur, 2001; Eriksson et\nal., 2006, and references therein]. Simulations of less than\n5 mHz fluctuations in the solar wind dynamic pressure have\nbeen found not to excite cavity modes, but undergo evanes-\ncent decay earthward of the magnetopause [Claudepierre et\nal., 2009]. If waves of these frequencies exist with the\ncapacity to generate significant bumps on the tail of the\nproton distributions, secondary waves could be generated\nwith m numbers beyond the observable limit of ARIES.\nAt fD\/ND < 2 mHz, mS is not constrained, and finite Larmor\nradius effects should be considered. In such cases it could be\nthat destabilized Alfv\u00e9n modes with azimuthal wavelengths\nof double the Larmor radius are favored [see Dettrick et al.,\n2003].\n[68] In a detailed case study of a single dayside event\nusing the CUTLASS HF radars, Yeoman and Wright\n[2000] split the event duration into three intervals. During\nthe first interval, Fourier components of 5.7 and 16 mHz\nwere observed, with low azimuthal wave numbers of m =\n6 \u00b1 3. The second interval contained a dominant 3.8 mHz\ncomponent, with m = \u201035 \u00b1 6, and the final interval was\ndominated by a 14.3 mHz wave, also with m = \u221235 \u00b1 6.\nOur study has neglected westward (negative m number)\nwaves, because the numerous and varied modes of reso-\nnance would not be expected to show clear dispersion rela-\ntion patterns. However, Yeoman and Wright [2000] inferred\nthe proton energies that would be required to drive the\nobserved westward waves through drift\u2010bounce resonance\ninteractions. These were 47 \u00b1 10 keV for the second interval\nand 34 \u00b1 10 keV for the third. Agreement is found with the\n35 keV proton energy derived in this paper for a 16 mHz\ncavity mode (low m number) wave, which may have been\ndirectly observed during the first interval of the event.\n[69] A possible reason why this mechanism has been pre-\nviously overlooked can be found in the early theory of drift\u2010\nmirror instability [Hasegawa, 1969], in which Landau\ndamping is assumed to be prevented by the lack of parallel\nelectric fields. Clearly, this is not the case where drift\u2010bounce\nresonance exists between waves and a particle population.\nThis is not to say however that other mechanisms, such as\npressure anisotropy, do not play a role in the acceleration\nof particles and subsequent generation of MHD waves.\n[70] Further work needs to be done with regard to the data\nfrom CAMMICE (Polar), before it can be claimed that\nenhancements in the magnetospheric proton distribution\nfunction occur at energies corresponding to the cavity mode\nfrequencies, but the early results appear promising.\n[71] The sum of evidence suggests that the high m number\nwaves observed in the morning sector cosmic noise absorp-\ntion are caused by electron precipitation modulation by\ndrift\u2010bounce resonant toroidal MHD waves, which are gen-\nerated by cavity mode waves through a process of Landau\ndamping followed by inverse\u2010Landau damping with the\nmagnetospheric proton population.\n[72] Acknowledgments.
