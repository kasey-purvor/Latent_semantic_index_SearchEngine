Reed\nAbstract\u2014This paper reports the simulation of the direct\ncurrent (dc), transient, and optical characteristics of low-loss\nsingle-mode optical phase modulators based on silicon-on-insu-\nlator (SOI) material. The devices operate by injecting free carriers\nto change the refractive index in the guiding region and have\nbeen modeled using the two-dimensional (2-D) device simulation\npackage SILVACO and the optical simulator BeamPROP to\ndetermine their electrical and optical performance, respectively.\nThese simulators have been employed to optimize the overlap\nbetween the injected free carriers in the intrinsic region and the\npropagating optical mode. Attention has been paid to both the\nsteady state and transient properties of the device. In order to\nproduce quantitative results, a particular p-i-n device geometry\nhas been employed in the study, but the trends in the results are\nsufficiently general to be of help in the design of many modulator\ngeometries. The specific example devices used are designed to sup-\nport a single optical guided mode and are of approximately 1 m\nin cross-sectional dimensions. The modeling results predict that\nthe transient performance of the device is affected significantly\nby the contact width and the rib doping depth. Results presented\nencompass Gaussian and constant doping profiles in the n+\nregions. The doping profile of the contacts has a tremendous effect\non both the dc and transient performances. Phase modulators\nwith drive currents as low as 0.5 mA and transient rise times of\n0.3 ns and fall times of 0.12 ns are predicted. Following from these\nresults, a realistic doping profile is proposed that surpasses the\nelectrical results of the Gaussian and most of the constant doping\nprofiles. The improvements in electrical device characteristics\nare at the expense of a slightly increased optical absorption loss.\nAn alternative switching technique is also presented that could\nfurther improve the device speed.\nIndex Terms\u2014Carrier injection, optical phase modulator,\nplasma dispersion effect, rib waveguides, silicon-on-insulator\n(SOI), silicon photonics.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOPTICAL switches and modulators are essential com-ponents for some integrated optics applications. In\nthis paper, we report the design of variants of a high-speed,\nsmall-geometry (0.98 m) optical phase modulator based on\nthe plasma dispersion effect, through analyzing a particular\ngeometry of the modulator using the two-dimensional (2-D)\nsemiconductor simulation package SILVACO [1].

While the\nresults are specific to the chosen device geometry, some of the\nresults are sufficiently general to enable improvement in the\nperformance of many other device geometries. A number of\ndesign parameters of the modulators are discussed, including\nthe optimum configuration of a three terminal p-i-n diode\naround a rib waveguide, and the optimization of both the power\nefficiency and the operating speed of the device, for various\ndoping profiles in the regions.\nIn recent years, there has been a significant interest in the de-\nvelopment of optical waveguide modulators and switches using\nsilicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates, motivated by the potential\nto provide a reliable low-cost alternative to other materials for\nfiber-based local access systems as well as a number of other ap-\nplications (e.g., [2]\u2013[4]). The main reasons why SOI has proven\nsuccessful for integrated optics are that the material and the pro-\ncessing are relatively low cost with resulting waveguides having\na loss as low as 0.15 dB\/cm (e.g., [5] and [6]). The SOI structure\nis strongly confining. A rib structure leads to vertical confine-\nment of the optical mode as a result of the high-refractive-index\ndifference between the air\/silicon\/SiO and horizontal confine-\nment results from the etched rib, enabling bends and intercon-\nnections to be produced much more easily than in structures that\nconfine the optical mode less well.\nUntil recently, the majority of researchers concentrated on\ndevices with silicon surface-layer thicknesses of the order of\nseveral microns, hence resulting in low-loss waveguides and\neasy coupling to and from the outside world. However, optical\nphase modulators based on overlayer thicknesses of several mi-\ncrons are limited to modest modulation bandwidths of the order\nof 10\u201320 MHz (e.g., [7] and [8]).\nIn order to increase the speed of these devices, it is desir-\nable to reduce the dimensions of the waveguides upon which the\nmodulators are based and, hence, the silicon overlayer thickness\nof the SOI wafer [9].\nII. MODULATION MECHANISM\nSoref and Bennet produced the following extremely useful\nexpressions relating the refractive index and absorption coeffi-\ncients changes in silicon [10] due to injection or depletion of\ncarriers in silicon [11], which are now widely used:\n1.55 m\n(1)\n0733-8724\/04$20.00 \u00a9 2004 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Furthermore, from\n(1) and (2), notice that a finite change in the silicon refractive\nindex must also result in a finite change in the absorption of\nthe silicon, and further, the absorption loss due to electrons is\ngreater than that for holes. A change in the carrier density can\nbe achieved by forward biasing a silicon p-i-n diode fabricated\naround the rib waveguide (Fig. 1).\nIII. DEVICE STRUCTURE\nFig. 1 shows the generic device structure to be considered in\nthis paper. It is a lateral optical phase modulator integrated into a\nlow-loss SOI rib waveguide. The device shown in Fig. 1 will be\nreferred to as the reference model (RM), such that any variations\nin the geometry of the device or doping profiles\/concentrations\nare implicitly to be compared with the reference modulator in\norder to demonstrate an improvement or a degradation in a de-\nvice performance. The RM in Fig. 1 represents the geometry\nused in all simulations unless otherwise stated.\nThe device has a symmetrical p-i-n structure where two\nregions are joined as a common cathode. In the reference\ndevice, both and regions were modeled as highly doped\nregions with constant doping concentrations of cm .\nThese devices were based around an overall silicon thickness\nof 0.98 m, etched rib waveguides 0.5 m wide with an etch\ndepth of 0.48 m in order to satisfy the single-mode condition\n[12]. The oxide thickness was modeled to be 0.4 m to ensure\nsufficiently good optical confinement.\nIV. ELECTRICAL AND OPTICAL ANALYSIS\nThe ATLAS device simulation package from SILVACO [1]\nhas been used to predict the electrical characteristics of the mod-\nulator. These include dc and transient characteristics. This 2-D\nsimulator is physically based and predicts the device electrical\ncharacteristics by solving semiconductor physics equations re-\nlated to the device physical structure, such as Poisson\u2019s equa-\ntion, and the charge continuity equations for holes and electrons.\nThe simulator has been used to predict the injected free-carrier\nconcentrations in the intrinsic region of the devices for both dc\nand transient biasing conditions. The change in concentration of\nfree carriers is then converted to refractive index change in the\ndevice by using (1) determined by Soref and Bennett [10]. Such\na simulator allows predictions of internal physical mechanisms,\nwhich are difficult to determine experimentally. This simulator\nis utilized here to enable a prediction of the injected free-carrier\ndensity under a range of different working conditions and de-\nvice geometries.\nThis approach has been validated in the past by experimental\nverification of predicted device performance (e.g., [8] and [13]).\nA change in refractive index of the silicon guiding layer re-\nsults from an injection of free carriers into the guiding region.\nIn order to maximize this change, we must optimize the inter-\naction between the injected free carriers and the propagating\noptical mode.\nThe simulator does not provide a prediction of the overlap in-\ntegral between the electrical carriers and the optical field. How-\never, it will be shown that there exists a high degree of unifor-\nmity in the predicted injected carrier concentration at the levels\nof interests throughout the central guiding region of the device.\nThis will clearly result in a uniform refractive index change\nacross the waveguiding region. Therefore, we can obtain from\nSILVACO the mean value of the injected carrier concentration\nin the guiding region and apply the results to (1) and (2) to ob-\ntain the resulting changes in refractive index and absorption for\nthe device under investigation, at a wavelength of 1.55 m.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The change in refractive index\nresults in a phase shift in the optical mode given approxi-\nmately by\n(3)\nwhere is the active length of the modulator in the -direction\nand is the change in refractive index due to injected carriers.\nThus, we can estimate the length required to produce a -phase\nshift as\n(4)\nAlternatively, we can rearrange (4) for and determine the\nrequired refractive-index change and, hence, the required carrier\ndensity to achieve a -phase shift for a fixed device length.\nV. SIMULATION RESULTS\nThe optical wavelength and the interaction length in the\ndirection in all the simulations were assumed to be 1.55 and\n500 m, respectively.\nA. Reference Modulator\n1) Modeling Characteristics: The device was modeled as-\nsuming ohmic contacts with no additional contact resistance\nor capacitance. The Shockley\u2013Reed\u2013Hall recombination carrier\nlifetime in the intrinsic region are 700 ns, 300 ns,\nwhere and are the electron and hole lifetimes, respectively.\nThe values of and correspond to a realistic intrinsic epi-\nlayer doping concentration of cm ; under forward bias,\nSILVACO adjusts the lifetime according to carrier concentra-\ntions [15]. It is expected that a device with shorter intrinsic\ncarrier lifetimes than that stated previously will have superior\nswitching capabilities, but this is at the expense of greater elec-\ntrical current. Conversely, a device with longer intrinsic car-\nrier lifetimes will have lower power consumption but slower\nswitching capabilities. One method of reducing the carrier life-\ntime of the intrinsic region is to include a lifetime killer, such as\ngold, but at the risk of CMOS incompatibility.\n2) Phase Modulation and Absorption: Fig. 2 shows the dc\nchange in refractive index plotted against drive current for the\nreference device in Fig. 1, with a radian drive current,\n1.48 mA and a corresponding current density of 592 A\/cm .\nis a typical measure of the quality of such devices. This pre-\ndicted current is an improvement in the experimental dc perfor-\nmance of over 370% over that of Tang et al., where their devices\noperated in the order of 7 mA [8].\nFrom Fig. 2, we can see that the change in refractive index\nvaries nonlinearly with applied current. One factor that con-\ntributes to the nonlinearity of the change in refractive index\nversus current density relation is the sublinear dependence of\nthe change in free holes, with the change in refractive\nindex, as shown in (1). In addition, as we drive the modulator\nFig. 2. Change in refractive index against drive current in the RM.\nharder, we inject more free carriers into the intrinsic region of\nthe device. This increase in the concentration of the previously\nintrinsic region results in an increase in the Auger recombina-\ntion rate (at injected carrier concentrations much greater than\ncm , the Auger recombination becomes the dominant\nrecombination process, e.g., [13]). This results in a reduced life-\ntime in this region and, hence, we have to drive the modulator\nharder to achieve an equivalent refractive-index change than at\nlower drive powers. Of course, an increase in the recombination\nrate will result in a faster switching device, i.e., reduction in the\nrise and fall times of the modulator.\n3) Switching Characteristics: The switching characteristics\nof the reference model in Fig. 1 were evaluated using a transient\nmodeling solution. For the transient solutions, both anode and\ncathode were first zero biased for 10 ns, followed by a step in-\ncrease to for 200 ns and a subsequent step decrease to 0 V.\nis the voltage corresponding to 180 phase shift. The rise time\nis defined as the time required for the induced phase shift\nto change from 10% to 90% of the maximum value. Likewise,\nthe fall time is defined as the time required for the induced\nphase shift to change from 90% to 10% of the maximum value.\nUnless otherwise stated, all subsequent transient solutions will\nbe subjected to this square waveform. For the reference model,\nthe rise and fall times were determined to be 0.51 ns and\n0.14 ns, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the rise and fall times,\nand it is clear that the rise time is the slower of the two and,\nhence, the limiting transition. In order to illustrate clearly both\nthe rise and fall times, a \u201cbreak\u201d in the horizontal time axis was\nmade so that the rising and falling edge of the transient wave-\nform could be highlighted.\n4) Injected Free Carriers in the Intrinsic Region: Fig. 4\nshows predictions of the injected electron and hole concentra-\ntions along a vertical section through the centre of the rib of\nthe reference model. The applied voltage is at 1.00, 0.92, and\n0.84 V for the upper, middle, and lower plots, respectively.\nThe injected plasma shows good uniformity in the intrinsic\nregion for the applied forward biases of interest. The maximum\nvariation in the concentration of the injected carriers through\nthe center of the waveguiding region is seen to be less than\n1%.

Injected free carriers along a vertical section (x = 12.3 \u0016m) for the\nreference model.\ndirection, which also predicts good carrier density uniformity.\nTherefore, it is justifiable to make the assumption of a constant\nprofile of injected carriers in the intrinsic region for the range\nof voltage biases of interest. From Fig. 4, we can see that it\nshould be relatively easy to produce injection density levels\n(electrons and holes) of cm and, in turn, we can\ncalculate the length needed to achieve a phase.\nUsing (4), we can approximate the length of the designed\nreference modulator needed to produce a -phase shift at this\nlevel of injection to be 465 m. Obviously, if the injection level\nis higher, can be reduced.\nB. Device Characteristics for the Modulator With Rounded\nEdges\nThis section considers the effect of rounded edges at the base\nof the rib, which may occur during fabrication of a real device.\nThe curvature occurs at points in Fig. 1 with radius of cur-\nvature . Values of used are 25 and 50 nm, as depicted in\nFig. 6. The results indicate a slight improvement in device per-\nformance, which appears to be greatest for a radius of curvature\n25 nm. For example, the RM requires a current of 1.48 mA\nFig. 5. Injected free carriers along a horizontal section (y = 0.6 \u0016m) for the\nreference model.\nto achieve a -phase shift, whereas for the rounded wall modu-\nlator with 25 nm, a forward current of 1.44 mA is required\nto achieve a -phase shift, a slight improvement of 2.7%. Intu-\nitively less crowding of carriers would be expected at a curved\ncorner than at an abrupt corner. This suggests that perhaps more\ncarriers will occupy areas of the waveguide in which the optical\nmode propagates, although this is likely to be a small effect. The\ndrive current required when 50 nm is similar to the device\nwith 25 nm.\nThere is an improvement of 17% in the rise time for the\nrounded wall modulator with 25 nm when compared with\nthe reference modulator (0.43 versus 0.51 ns), whereas the fall\ntime does not exhibit significant change (0.15 versus 0.14 ns).\nThe rise and fall times when 50 nm are 0.45 and 0.16 ns.\nOverall, the results indicate that both the dc and transient perfor-\nmance of the modulator can be influenced slightly by the small\nchange from a straight rib wall to one that has a small radius of\ncurvature at the rib base.\nC. Doping Distribution\nAs the optical phase modulators reported here utilize the free-\ncarrier plasma dispersion effect, the doping distributions have a\ntremendous influence on device performance parameters, such\nas drive current and operating speed. Aspects investigated in-\nclude the doping concentrations, doping depths, and doping pro-\nfiles of the and regions.\n1) Effect of Side (n) Dopant Depth: The depth of the con-\ntact doping has a significant impact on the modulator perfor-\nmance. In Fig. 1, the RM has a side contact depth of 0.4 m\nheavily doped with donors at cm . The RM requires a\nforward drive current of 1.48 mA to achieve a -phase shift\n, whereas the modulator with the shallower doping depth\nof 0.2 m requires 2.4 mA. Hence, there is an increase in\nthe current consumption of 60% when the side contact depth is\nshallower. Conversely, is reduced by 200% when the contact\ndepth is even deeper than in the RM (0.5 m). Fig. 7 displays\nthese results graphically.\nThe transient response also yields improvements in the rise\nand fall times of the modulators with deeper doping. The rise\nand fall times were 1.5 and 0.34 ns, respectively, for the mod-\nulator with the shallower doping depth (0.2 m), whereas the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Fig. 8 shows\nthe rise times.\nThe increase in both the dc and transient performance with in-\ncreasing doping depth is partly due to the increase in the number\nof free electrons and holes, which are available for injection in\nto the guiding region, because increasing the dopant depth in-\ncreases the area of the injection contact adjacent to the wave-\nguiding region. A shallow doping depth also tends to result in a\nlarger proportion of the injected carriers residing in the area di-\nrectly below the doping regions, where little of the optical mode\nexists.\nThese calculations were made for constant concentration pro-\nfiles. In a real device, the concentration profiles will vary, but\nthe trends regarding the depth of doping will still be applicable,\nsuggesting that the deepest doping possible is desirable. How-\never, the disadvantage in a deep doping region is an increase in\nthe complexity and time of the fabrication process.\n2) Effect of Top-Rib Doping Depth: Varying the top-rib\ndoping depth while keeping the remainder of the parameters\nunchanged showed that the rib doping depth has a very sig-\nFig. 8. Phase modulation versus transient time for various side-doping contact\ndepths.\nnificant impact on the modulation speed [14]. For example,\nwhen the doping depth is decreased from 0.3 to 0.1 m, the\nrise time increased from 0.51 to 0.99 ns, respectively. This, in\nturn, implies that the modulation speed decreased from 980 to\n500 MHz. The fall time also increased from 0.14 to 0.36 ns,\nwith a reduction in top-rib dopant depth. The drive current\nremains at approximately 1.5 mA for both doping depths.\nHowever, the optical attenuation increases if the doping depth\nextends too deeply into the rib.\n3) The Effect of Doping Concentration: The concentration\nof the doping regions also affects the dc and transient perfor-\nmance of the modulator. The doping concentrations of the refer-\nence model were constant and, hence, there may be some degra-\ndation in real devices due to the difficulty in fabricating such a\ndoping profile.\nFor a range of different combinations of concentrations\nranging from to cm in the contact windows,\nit is observed that there is an increase in the modulator\u2019s dc\nperformance for higher doping concentration. For example, the\nreference model has doping concentrations of cm in\nboth the and contact windows. To achieve a -phase\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

For a similar device with\ndoping concentrations that are an order of magnitude lower\n(i.e., cm ), a forward current of 10.5 mA is required to\nachieve a -phase shift for a modulator of 500- m interaction\nlength. Consequently, there is an increase in the current re-\nquired for a -phase shift by a factor of seven for the modulator\nwith lower doping concentration. Fig. 9 shows these dc results\ngraphically.\nInterestingly, reducing the doping concentration results in a\nslight decrease in the rise time of the modulator, while the fall\ntime remains almost unchanged. For the two devices compared\npreviously, was 0.51 ns for the reference model, which has a\nhigher doping concentration, and 0.44 ns for the lower doping\nconcentration device, while the fall times are 0.14 and\n0.15 ns, respectively. Fig. 10 shows the transient results, and all\nthe doping concentration results are summarized in Table I.\nAn increase in the doping concentration of the and re-\ngions will increase the static absorption of the optical mode that\nimpinges on the and regions. In addition, the increase in\nthe doping concentration of the and regions will result in\na small increase in the refractive-index difference between the\nintrinsic region and the and , resulting in slightly stronger\nconfinement of the propagating optical mode in the intrinsic re-\ngion; therefore, a smaller portion of the optical mode will prop-\nagate in the highly doped and regions. The static absorp-\ntion loss is defined as the zero-bias optical propagation loss of\nthe device due to free-carrier absorption of parts of the optical\nmode profiles that extend into the doped contacts, together with\nFig. 10. Phase modulation versus transient time for various doping\nconcentration levels.\nabsorption loss due to the low density of carriers in the wave-\nguide core.\nThe dynamic optical absorption is defined as the optical prop-\nagation loss of the device when biased such that a radian phase\nshift is induced and is due to the additional absorption loss due to\ninjected electrons and holes. Assuming the number of injected\ncarriers in the waveguiding region is cm , from (4) the\nabsorption coefficient for the reference model is 7.25 cm\n(i.e., 31.5 dB\/cm). This would result in a dynamic optical ab-\nsorption of approximately 1.6 dB if the active device length is\n500 m.\nD. Effects Due to the Displacement of the Side-Doping\nContacts From the Rib Edges\nAn evaluation of the modulator performance was made\nin terms of the displacement of the doping contact windows\nfrom the base of the rib. This is represented by the variable\n\u201c \u201d in Fig. 1, which was investigated in terms of the device\nperformance.\n1) DC Characteristics: The dc results are shown in Fig. 11\nand predict that there is an increased performance in terms of in-\nduced phase modulation against current if the doping windows\nare placed close to the center of the waveguide. This is a con-\nsequence of the reduction in the distance between the and\nregions. However, with decreasing separation of the and\nregions, the doping in the region where the majority of the\noptical mode propagates is increased, which will result in an in-\ncrease in the absorption of the device.

For applications where low optical\nattenuation takes precedence over device operating speed, \u201c \u201d\ncan be increased as the drive current would not increase signif-\nicantly while reducing optical absorption. However, the device\noperating speed would reduce with the increase in \u201c \u201d as dis-\ncussed in the next section.\n2) Switching Characteristics: Fig. 12 shows the phase mod-\nulation against time for the modulator with varying values of\n\u201c \u201d. The applied square-wave input is similar to that described\npreviously. The results indicate that the spacing distance be-\ntween the doped regions and the rib edge affects the switching\ncharacteristics of the modulator more than any other param-\neter studied in this paper. For example, the device operating\nspeed decreases by over 70% when \u201c \u201d is increased from 50\nto 750 nm. Fig. 12 has a \u201cbreak\u201d in the horizontal axis in order\nto display more clearly the rise and fall times. The switching\ntimes are summarized in Table II.\nClearly, there is an associated improvement in the lateral con-\nfinement of the optical mode when the regions are translated\ntoward the center of the rib (smaller \u201c \u201d). Hence, this results in\nreduced switching times due to the reduction in the time taken to\nfill or deplete the area where the optical mode now propagates.\nThe constant doping profile of the contacts shown in Fig. 1\nis difficult to fabricate. A more realistic profile would be some\nFig. 12. Phase modulation versus transient time for various dimensions of the\nvariable \u201cA\u201d\u2014the distance between the side contact doping and the rib edge.\nsort of graded profile such as a Gaussian doping profile. How-\never, the electrical performance for a device with Gaussian pro-\nfiles at the side yields inferior characteristics compared with that\nof the RM, which has a constant side-doping profile. For ex-\nample, when the side dopant profile is changed from constant to\na Gaussian type, increases from 1.48 to 3.72 mA. Likewise,\nthe rise time increases from 0.51 to 1.08 ns, while the fall time\nstays unchanged at 0.14 ns. In response to this, an achievable\nside dopant profile that surpasses the performance of the device\nwith the Gaussian doping profile and most of the variants of de-\nvices with constant doping profile was also developed. We have\ncalled this the optimum profile, a term that requires some expla-\nnation, because the term optimum profile could be interpreted\nto mean that this profile should provide the best performance.\nHowever, it has been shown that a particular constant profile\n[Section V-C-1] can outperform the optimum profile in terms\nof both device current and speed. However, the optimum profile\nprovides the best compromise between device performance and\na realistic profile that is manufacturable without prohibitively\ndifficult or unrealistic fabrication requirements. This optimum\ndoping profile in the side regions is achieved through a series\nof different implantation steps such that the peak concentration\nat the surface of the contact is approximately cm\nand decreases to approximately cm at the interface be-\ntween the silicon and the buried oxide. The determination of this\nprofile was achieved through the process simulation package\nATHENA from SILVACO [1]. The optimum profile predicts an\nof 0.7 mA, rise and fall times of 0.38 and 0.13 ns. The dc and\ntransient results for all three different profiles are illustrated in\nFigs. 13 and 14, respectively.\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Predicted transient performance for the RM with various doping\nprofiles.\nIn this type of silicon-based modulator, phase modulation is\nalways accompanied by some unwanted absorption in the active\nmode, as described by (2). For example, the unwanted attenua-\ntion for a 500- m-long device with optimized side-doping pro-\nfile is approximately 1.45 dB ( 28.97 dB\/cm) when sufficient\ncarriers are injected to achieve a radian phase shift.\nE. Optical Simulation of the RM\nIn this section, the effect of polarization and the effects\nof the side dopant spacing on optical power loss is predicted\nusing BeamPROP, commercially available optical simulation\nsoftware [16]. The simulations were calculated based on the\nsemi-vectorial beam propagation method (BPM) operating\nat a wavelength of 1.55 m. The modeling of the SOI rib\nwaveguide is based on the RM of Fig. 1 with a SiO buried\noxide (BOX) layer thickness of 400 nm. The refractive index\nof the silicon guiding layer is , and the BOX layer\nand cladding are and , respectively. The\nFig. 15. Optical output power with varying distance between the side-doping\nregions and the base of the rib.\nthree-dimensional (3-D) mesh grid spacing used for the BPM\nsimulation are 0.005 m, 0.01 m, and 0.04 m.\nThe inherent high-refractive-index contrast in SOI material\nenables the realization of submicrometer waveguide without\nsacrificing the mode confinement and single-mode operation.\nWhen the rib waveguide dimensions are reduced to sub-\nmicrometer levels, high scattering loss is dominated by the\nwaveguide sidewall roughness and must be addressed. The rela-\ntionship between waveguide losses, and waveguide dimensions\nhad been studied extensively to enable the design and fabri-\ncation of waveguide in SOI with minimal loss (e.g., [17] and\n[18]), where 0.1-dB\/cm transmission loss was demonstrated\nfor a device that is 200 nm in Si height [18]. This reaffirms that\nthe RM, which is 980 nm in Si height, is feasible.\n1) The Optical Effect of the Side Dopant Window Position:\nIn Section V-D-2), the spacing parameter \u201c \u201d between the side\ndopant window and the rib edge was shown to have a tremen-\ndous effect on the modulator operating bandwidth. When \u201c \u201d\nhas a value of 50 nm (RM), the optical modulator has superior\nswitching characteristics when compared with devices having\na larger value of \u201c \u201d. However, the device also suffers exces-\nsive optical absorption of the propagating optical mode. Fig. 15\nshows the relationship between the optical power and the side\ndopant spacing for the optical modulator in Fig. 1. As can be\nseen from Fig. 15, the RM introduces a high attenuation to the\noptical signal because the contact spacing is small.\nFrom Fig. 15, the optical attenuation introduced to the mod-\nulator reaches a plateau when \u201c \u201d is approximately 1.5 m.\nThis implies that at values of \u201c \u201d 1.5 m, the modulator ex-\nperiences minimal optical attenuation due to the contacts.\nHence, by choosing \u201c \u201d to be 1.5 m and performing a similar\nstudy for the dopant depth at the top of the rib, an optical\nmodulator that has minimal optical loss can be selected. Fig. 16\nshows the relationship between the optical output power and the\ntop-rib doping depth.\nAn alternative device with side-doping contacts 1.5 m from\nthe rib edge (i.e., \u201c \u201d 1.5 m) and a rib doping depth of\n0.1 m introduces approximately 0.43 dB of passive loss for\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

This \u201cnew\u201d device is expected to op-\nerate in the region of approximately 95 MHz with a drive cur-\nrent requirement of the order of approximately 15 mA. This is a\nclear demonstration of a tradeoff between the power consump-\ntion and the device operating speed with respect to the spacing\nbetween the side dopant window and the rib edge. An alterna-\ntive electrical injection method is introduced in the next section\nto significantly improve the electrical operating characteristics\nof such a device. This \u201cnew\u201d device is termed Device (a).\nVI. ALTERNATIVE ELECTRICAL SWITCHING\nDevice (a) is predicted to operate in the range of approxi-\nmately 95 MHz 5.25 ns , and although this speed is\nmore than seven-fold faster than current silicon-based optical\nphase modulators reported as typically 13 MHz (e.g., [7]), it is\nstill low compared to the operating speed of compound mate-\nrials which operate in multi-gigahertz regime (e.g., [19]). Con-\nsequently, further work has been carried out to try to improve\nthis situation. This section discusses an alternative electronic\ndrive waveform to enhance device speed.\nA. Determination of Switching Waveform\nIn all the previous transient analysis, a rectangular pulse is\napplied to the device, and the limiting switching parameter is the\nrise time . We can improve the response time of the modulator\nusing an alternative driving waveform.\nDetermination of this waveform was made as follows: in\norder to decrease , an extremely short pulse (of the order\nof picoseconds) was applied to the anode to switch from 0 V\nto a voltage approximately five times . Doing so results in\na faster injection of the electrons and holes into the intrinsic\nregion via the larger applied field, thus reducing the rise time.\nSimilarly, to improve the fall time, the same principle was\napplied to the falling edge of the waveform, and it is concluded\nthat the optimum fall time would result when a negative voltage\nof approximately ten times the -phase shift voltage is\napplied. Fig. 17 depicts this waveform. Using this switching\nwaveform allows us to obtain a switching speed of more than\n5.8 GHz 85 ps compared with the typical switching\nFig. 17. Alternative switching waveform applied to Device (a). The magnitude\nof the waveform at the rise and fall times was derived after determining the\noptimum voltage necessary for the lowest switching times.\nfrequency of Device (a), which is of the order of 95 MHz.\nClearly, there are some difficulties in generating the waveform\nof Fig. 17, but the increased device speed is very significant.\nB. Ramifications of the Fast Switching Waveform\nThe switching result generated by the waveform is extremely\npromising as it offers the possibility of active silicon optical\nphase modulators starting to compete with costly compound\nmaterials used traditionally in high-speed modulation devices.\nHowever, there are a number of points that must be noted in con-\nnection with this proposed switching.\nThe first is the amount of charge switched within the device\nduring the rise and fall sections of the waveform. The peak\ncurrent corresponding to the rise time for a conventional square\nwave drive is approximately 24 mA m compared with\napproximately 500 mA m for the fast switching waveform.\nSuch high levels of current are clearly problematic.\nThe second point concerns the drive circuitry. In order to\nachieve rise times of the order of tens of picoseconds and at such\nhigh voltage levels, the design of the drive circuitry is complex\nand must be capable of switching such high currents in very\nshort times.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThe plasma dispersion effect offers a means for electrically\ncontrolled optical modulation in a silicon waveguide. It has been\nshown that efficient phase modulation can be achieved in silicon\nby use of a p-i-n diode structure to inject charge carriers into an\nSOI waveguide. We have predicted that by using small geometry\noptical modulators, gigahertz modulation bandwidth could be\nachieved for a driving current of 1.5 mA.\nThis paper analyzed the device characteristics using a 2-D\nsemiconductor simulation package SILVACO to investigate the\ndc and transient behavior of the active region of the modulator.\nThe paper also studied the effects of rounded rib edges,\ndoping profiles and concentrations, diffusion depths, and\nalignment of the doped regions, on both the static and dynamic\nbehavior of the phase modulator. The results indicate that\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on June 12, 2009 at 11:56 from IEEE Xplore.

While\nthis paper discusses the results of a specific phase modulator\ndesign, the results suggest that deep contacts and close lateral\nseparation of the contacts would also enhance the performance\nof other p-i-n phase modulator geometries, although there\nwould clearly need to be a specific evaluation of any given\ndesign.\nThe optical characteristics of the phase modulator was also\nanalyzed with specific attention to its side dopant placement\nfrom the rib base, and it was concluded that the position of the\nside contact is a compromise between device speed and loss.\nWe have proposed a switching waveform that is predicted to\nincrease the device speed of one specific design from 95 MHz\nto more than 5 GHz.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nC.
