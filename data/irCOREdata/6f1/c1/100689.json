INTRODUCTION\nSingle-nucleon knockout reactions induced by rare inter-\nmediate energy secondary beams are currently the object of\nconsiderable interest from both a theoretical and experimental\npoint of view [1\u20134]. They permit the identification of nucleon\nlevel orderings and their associated spectroscopic strengths\nwhich can be compared with the predictions of modern\nstructure theories. The utility of such reactions for the\nsingle-particle spectroscopy of exotic nuclei have been dis-\ncussed extensively elsewhere, e.g. [5\u20137].\nSeveral reaction models have now been developed with\nthe aim of making detailed quantitative comparisons with the\nresults of experiments. In this work we consider what has\nbecome known as the transfer-to-the-continuum (TC) model,\nas developed by Bonaccorso and Brink [8]. The model has\nits basis in the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA)\ntreatment of nucleon transfer reactions between heavy nuclear\ncores [9\u201312], supplemented by a semiclassical treatment of the\nentrance and exit channel distorted waves [13]. Because of the\nway that the coordinates of the heavy projectile core are treated\nthe theory is not strictly DWBA, but is an approximation to\nDWBA.\nSeveral TC model variants, each involving further simpli-\nfications in the evaluation of the TC approximation to the\nDWBA transfer amplitude, have been published. These have\nbeen motivated, in large part, by a wish to maintain near-\nanalytical forms for the reaction observables\u2014specifically the\nnucleon removal cross section and the momentum distribution\nof the heavy projectile remnant. In the present paper we will\n\u2217Electronic address: camacho@df.unipi.it; Present address:\nInstituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Pisa, I-56100 Pisa,\nItaly.\nlook critically at these different approximation schemes by\nperforming calculations of the TC amplitude in its more exact\nform. This necessitates a greater numerical effort. In this way\nwe will check the accuracy of these often-used approximations.\nWe will restrict discussion here to entrance and exit channel\ninteractions with the target that are spin independent. An\nanalysis of the effects of spin-dependent interactions with\nthe target on the TC model predictions of cross sections,\nresidue magnetic substate populations and excited residue\ndecay-photon angular distributions will be reported elsewhere.\nThe main theoretical ingredients of the TC model are\npresented in Sec. II and the different approximation schemes\nare developed in Sec. III. In Sec. IV the choice of physical\nparameters and model interactions that enter the calculations\nare discussed. Sec. V then presents applications to specific\nsingle-neutron knockout reactions and clarifies the outcomes\nand the accuracy of the different approximation schemes of\nSec. III, all calculated using a common set of physical model\nparameters.\nII. THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE MODEL\nThe starting point for the transfer-to-the-continuum model\nof the breakup reaction is the one-step DWBA transition\namplitude for the transfer of a light particle between discrete\nbound states in heavy nuclei [8]. The projectile nucleus is\ntreated as the bound state of a heavy core nucleus and the\ntransferred particle, which together with the heavy target\nconstitute an effective three-body problem. The TC model [8]\nthen considers the projectile breakup mechanism as a gener-\nalized particle transfer in which the final states are now the\nunbound continuum states of the transferred particle-target\nspectrum. The key steps of this development are summarized\n0556-2813\/2005\/71(4)\/044606(9)\/$23.00 044606-1 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society\nA. GARC\u00b4IA-CAMACHO, R. C. JOHNSON, AND J. A. TOSTEVIN PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 044606 (2005)\nbelow. Throughout the present paper, the transferred particle\nis assumed to be a neutron.\nA. Semiclassical approach to particle transfer\nWithin the one-step DWBA approach, the neutron transfer\nreaction differential cross section can be written [10,13]\nd\u03c3\nd\u0002\n= 1(2l1 + 1)\n\u03c0\nK2\n\u00b5i\n\u00b5f\n\u2211\nm1m2\n\u2223\u2223Tl1m1l2m2 \u2223\u22232. (1)\nHere l1,m1 and l2,m2 are the orbital angular momentum\nquantum numbers of the transferred neutron in the initial\nand final bound states, \u00b5i and \u00b5f are the neutron-core and\nneutron-target reduced masses, and K is the wave number of\nthe projectile-target relative motion. Spin degrees of freedom\nhave been suppressed. The transfer amplitude Tl1m1l2m2 , upon\napplying the WKB approximation and the semiclassical orbit\nconcept to the entrance and exit channel distorted waves [13],\ncan be written, with \u02c6L = \u221a2L + 1, as\nTl1m1l2m2 (\u0002\u0302) = im1\u2212m2\n\u2211\nL\n\u02c6L exp(2i\u03b4L)\n\u00d7A(L, l1m1l2m2)YLm1\u2212m2 (\u0002\u0302). (2)\nHere \u0002\u0302 denotes the scattering angles of the deflected core,\nL is the relative angular momentum between the core and the\ntarget and \u03b4L the associated phase shift, the sum of nuclear and\nCoulomb scattering phase shifts. Finally, A is a semiclassical\ntransfer amplitude in which the core degrees of freedom\nenter only through the quantum number L, but not through\nany angular or other dependence. Calculation of the transfer\nprocess thus involves only the transferred neutron degrees of\nfreedom. The explicit expression for A is [10]\nA(L, l1m1l2m2) = 1\nih\u00af\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndt\u3008\u0005f |Vcn|\u0005i\u3009, (3)\nwhere \u0005i is the wave function of the neutron in the initial state,\ni.e., the bound-state solution of the Schro\u00a8dinger equation for\nthe neutron and core in potential Vcn. Similarly, \u0005f is the\nneutron-target relative motion wave function in the final state\nwith potential Vtn.\nAn explicit expression for this semiclassical transfer ampli-\ntude can be obtained upon making assumptions for the motion\nof the core. Near the distance of closest approach, the problem\nis simplified in the following ways. (i) The masses of the\ncore and the target nuclei are assumed to be much larger than\nthat of the transferred particle. (ii) The core is assumed to\nfollow a straight-line trajectory \u0006R(t), with impact parameter\nb = (L + 1\/2)\/K , and with a constant velocity. In this way\nthe transfer between the core and target nuclei is transformed\ninto a problem in which the neutron feels the effect of two\npotential fields in motion with respect to one another [14]. We\ndescribe this process using a target-centered reference frame\nwith z axis chosen in the incident beam direction and the x axis\nin the plane of the core-target relative motion. The neutron\nposition coordinate in this frame is \u0006r and hence Vcn in Eq. (3)\nhas argument \u0006r \u2212 \u0006R(t), Fig. 1. The neutron transfer will take\nplace in a localized region of the core straight-line trajectory,\nnear the core-target distance of closest approach. In practice,\nn\nr\n)(tR\nb\nz\n\u03a3\n0x\nFIG. 1. Schematic of the core, target, and neutron three-body\nproblem, showing the coordinate system used, the straight line core\ntrajectory and the intervening \u0006 surface in the external region of the\nneutron wave functions.\nfor the beam energies discussed here, the distance of closest\napproach is identified with the core-target impact parameter b,\nthe Coulomb interaction being assumed not to modify the core\ntrajectory [9].\nSince our choice of reference frame is fixed at the target,\na Galilean transformation is required to boost the initial state\nwave function. This is given by [15]\n\u0005i(\u0006r, t) = \u03c6l1m1 [\u0006r \u2212 \u0006R(t)] exp[i(m\u0006v \u00b7 \u0006r \u2212 \bi t \u2212 mv2t\/2)\/h\u00af],\n(4)\nwhich includes the time dependence of the core coordinate.\nHere \u03c6l1m1 is the bound state wave function of the neutron-core\nsystem in its rest frame. The final state does not require a\nGalilean boost, and hence\n\u0005f (\u0006r, t) = \u03c6l2m2 (\u0006r) exp[\u2212i\bf t\/h\u00af]. (5)\nIt is now further assumed that the reaction is sufficiently\nperipheral that one can insert a planar surface \u0006 between the\ncore and target nuclei, that lies entirely in a region where\nthe neutron potentials with the core and target, Vcn and Vtn,\nare negligible, Fig. 1. In this case the transfer amplitude can\nbe written [9,10] with reference only to wave function values\non \u0006 as\nA(b, l1m1l2m2) = h\u00af2mi\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\ndt\n\u222b\n\u0006\nd \u0006S \u00b7 (\u0005\u2217f \u2207\u0006r\u0005i \u2212 \u0005i\u2207\u0006r\u0005\u2217f ).\n(6)\nSince the \u0006 surface defines a region external to the neutron\ninteractions, only the external, preasymptotic, analytic expres-\nsions for the initial and final state neutron wave functions are\nthen required.\nAs stated earlier, this model was originally created for\ntransfer reactions and then extended to breakup. At this point\nit can be seen that such a distinction enters through the form\nassumed for \u0005f . In the transfer case a bound state wave\nfunction is used, whereas in breakup a scattering state is used\nto describe the unbound continuum state. For transfer reactions\nboth of the \u03c6 correspond to bound states. Their external forms\nare [9]\n\u03c6lm(\u0006r) = Cl\u03b3 il+1h+l (i\u03b3 r)Ylm( r\u0302 ), (7)\nwhere \u03b3 = \u221a2m|\b|\/h\u00af is determined by the separation energy\n|\b| and r\u0302 denotes the angular dependence of the vector \u0006r .\nWe use h+ = ih(1), where the h(1) are the spherical Bessel\n044606-2\nIMPROVED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRANSFER-TO- . . .

[9,10], k1 (k2) can be interpreted as\nthe z- component of the momentum of the transferred particle\nin the projectile (target) rest frame, while \u03be as the magnitude\nof its transverse momentum.\nWhen the wave functions assume their external forms then\nthese flm can be evaluated analytically and\nfl1m1 (b \u2212 x0, ky, kz) =\n2\u03c0\n\u03b3i,x\nCl1 exp[\u2212\u03b3i,x(b \u2212 x0)]Yl1m1 (K\u0302i),\nfl2m2 (x0, ky, kz) =\n2\u03c0\n\u03b3f,x\nCl2 exp[\u2212\u03b3f,xx0]Yl2m2 (K\u0302f ). (12)\nHere we have introduced the (complex) vectors \u0006Ki and \u0006Kf\nwith components\n\u0006Ki = (i\u03b3i,x, ky, kz), \u0006Kf = (i\u03b3f,x, ky, kz), (13)\nwhere\n\u03b3 2i,x = k2z + k2y + \u03b3 2i , \u03b3 2f,x = k2z + k2y + \u03b3 2f , (14)\nand the spherical harmonics of complex argument are un-\nderstood in terms of the (homogeneous) solid harmonic\npolynomials\n(i\u03b3f )lYlm(K\u0302f ) = Ylm(i\u03b3f,x, ky, kz).

Breakup cross section\nIn the breakup case the final state external wave function\nis no longer defined by Eq.

The\nsame procedure as in the transfer case can be carried out for\nbreakup, i.e., to express amplitude Eq. (18) as the flux through\nthe intermediate \u0006 surface on which the wave functions take\ntheir external forms [13].

Thus,\neven if the initial bound state total angular momentum j1\ndoes not appear explicitly in Eq. (23), there is an implied\nj1 dependence through the bound state ANC Cl1 . Herein, we\nrefer to Eq. (23) as the full, or exact, Bessel function form of\nthe cross section.\nIn Ref. [8] it was also shown that an approximate treatment\nof the cross section for inelastic breakup, also referred to as\nthe stripping mechanism, and taking account of all inelastic\nexcitations of the target, can be included by redefining\u2223\u2223Jl2 \u2223\u22232 = [{1 \u2212 \u2223\u2223Sl2 \u2223\u22232}+ \u2223\u22231 \u2212 Sl2 \u2223\u22232]\/4.

TOSTEVIN PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 044606 (2005)\nIII. APPROXIMATIONS TO THE TC AMPLITUDES\nWith the purpose of carrying these analytical expressions\nas far as possible, and being assisted by the large typical\n\u03beb (or \u03b7b) values implied by transfer between heavy nuclear\ncores, further simplifications of Eq. (23) have been carried out\nin the literature. These approximations are summarized in this\nsection.\nA. Truncated Bessel function expansion approximation\nAs discussed above, the TC model was originally developed\nfrom consideration of reactions involving particle transfer\nbetween heavy ion cores [19,20]. A characteristic of such\nheavy (large) nuclear systems is that Pel(b) is significantly\ndifferent from zero only for such large values of b that \u03b7b is\nlarge. In these cases the Km1\u2212m2 (\u03b7b) Bessel function can be\napproximated by its asymptotic expansion [16]\nKm1\u2212m2 (\u03b7b) \b\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n2\u03b7b\nexp(\u2212\u03b7b)\n\u00d7\n(\n1 + \u00b5 \u2212 1\n8\u03b7b\n+ (\u00b5 \u2212 1)(\u00b5 \u2212 9)\n2(8\u03b7b)2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n)\n,\n(25)\nwhere \u00b5 = 4(m1 \u2212 m2)2. If only the leading (zeroth-order)\nterm is retained [21] then its dependence on m1 \u2212 m2 disap-\npears, and the sums over m1 and m2 in Eq. (23) can be carried\nout using the identity\u2211\nm\n|Ylm(\u03b8, \u03c6)|2 = (2l + 1)4\u03c0 Pl(cos \u03b8 ), (26)\nwhere Pl is the Legendre Polynomial of order l. Eq.

[9,22]. We refer to this as the\nzeroth-order TC approximation.\nB. M-function approximation\nIn an attempt to extend the applications of the formalism to\nlighter nuclei, but retaining the analytical clarity, in Ref. [11]\nthe following M-function approximation was developed for\ntransfer and later applied to breakup studies. Eq.

CHOICE OF MODEL PARAMETERS\nWe now apply the theoretical formalisms developed in\nSecs. II and III to three specific knockout reaction transi-\ntions. All examples were the subject of recent experiments\ncarried out at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab-\noratory at Michigan State University [5,7]. These are the\n9Be(34Si,33Si+\u03b3 )X reaction at a beam energy of 73 MeV\nper nucleon [5], for which the ground state to ground\nstate one-neutron separation energy is 7.36 MeV, and the\n9Be(15C,14C+\u03b3 )X reaction at 54 MeV per nucleon [7] with\nground state separation energy of only 1.218 MeV. We consider\nalso the 15C \u2192 14C(1\u2212, 6.09 MeV) transition with separation\nenergy 7.37 MeV. The ground state transitions are 0+ \u2192 3\/2+\nand 1\/2+ \u2192 0+, respectively. Our examples have been chosen\nto examine the sensitivity of approximations in the TC model\ncalculations to both the nucleon orbital angular momentum\nand the separation energy.\nAs was discussed earlier, the TC model uses a description\nof the initial and final state wave functions of the transferred\n044606-4\nIMPROVED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRANSFER-TO- . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 71, 044606 (2005)\nnucleon which are valid only in the external region. The\nseparation energy is seen to enter the model through the\nreaction kinematics, the wave function matching conditions,\nEq. (21), and the assumed external form of the single-particle\noverlap function (the spherical Hankel function) and its ANC,\nCl . These Cl are computed, using Eq. (7), by matching a\nHankel function to the tails of the entrance channel bound state\nradial wave functions \u03c7jl(r) calculated in Woods-Saxon po-\ntentials with a fixed geometry (r0 = 1.25 fm and a = 0.7 fm),\na spin-orbit potential of strength 6.0 MeV and with the\ncentral potential depths adjusted to reproduce the required\nneutron separation energies. For the 33Si(g.s.) transition, as-\nsuming a 0d3\/2 neutron configuration, then C2 = 2.92 fm\u22121\/2.\nFor the 1s1\/2,14C(g.s.) transition we obtain C0 = 1.47 fm\u22121\/2\nwhile for the excited, 0p3\/2 14C(1\u2212, 6.09 MeV) neutron tran-\nsition, C1 = 3.11 fm\u22121\/2. For the given parameters the depths\nof the potential wells are 46.48 MeV for 34Si and 49.32 MeV\nand 45.27 MeV for the g.s. and 1\u2212 transitions from 15C.\nA. Core-target interaction\nIn the TC formalism, the interaction Vct of the heavy\nprojectile core, or residue, with the target nucleus does not\naffect the dynamics of the core motion during the reaction.\nThe core is assumed to travel a straight line path at constant\nvelocity. Rather, the effects of Vct enter the formalism\n(semiclassically) through the associated probability of the\npassage of the core, in the elastic channel, past the target\nat an impact parameter b. This is the factor Pel(b) in Eq. (23).\nThis is of course the square modulus of the core-target\nelastic S matrix, |exp(2i\u03b4L)|2, entering through Eq. (2), but\nexpressed as a function of the core impact parameter, b =\n(L + 1\/2)\/K . Since, theoretically, the peripheral nature of the\nreaction is dictated entirely by the absorptive content of\nthis factor at small impact parameters, its spatial form is of\nsome importance and must accurately reflect the empirical\nresidue-target reaction cross section. Since the TC model\nassumes not only peripherality of the reaction, but that we\nare fully external in the wave functions of the transferred\nparticle in the initial and final states, Pel(b) is instrumental\nin determining the actual active regions of radial overlap of\nthese wave functions and hence the resulting cross sections.\nTo take proper account of the geometrical sizes of the core\nand target and their associated strong absorption radius, we\nconstruct Vct by the double-folding of their matter densities\nwith an effective nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction. The\nsimple Gaussian effective NN interaction used was chosen\nto reproduce measured heavy-ion cross section systematics in\nthis energy and mass region within such double-folding model\ncalculations [23,24]. The Pel(b) = |Sct(b)|2 were calculated\nfrom the complex double folding model Vct using the eikonal\napproximation to the S matrix, Sct(b), e.g., [2].\nThe 14C and 33Si core matter densities were assumed to\nhave Gaussian form factors with range parameters chosen to\nreproduce the empirically deduced root mean squared matter\nradii. These were 2.30 fm [25] and 3.16 fm, respectively. The\nlatter value was based on an assumed charge radius of 3.27 fm,\nestimated from comparisons with the stable S and Si isotopes\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nELab (MeV)\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\nCr\nos\ns \nse\nct\nio\nn \n(m\nb)\n\u03c3Reac(p+\n9Be)\n\u03c3Total(n+\n9Be)\nFIG. 2. The p+9Be reaction cross section and n+9Be total cross\nsection predictions using the JLM folding model optical potential.\nThe data are from Refs. [32] and [33], respectively.\n[26]. The density used for the 9Be target is detailed in the\nfollowing subsection.\nB. Neutron-target interaction\nWe described the neutron-target system using the nuclear\nmatter effective NN interaction of Jeukenne, Lejeune, and\nMahaux (JLM) [27], based on the Reid hard-core free NN\ninteraction [28]. The resulting energy- and density-dependent\neffective interaction is used to calculate the nucleon optical\npotential on the finite target by single folding with its\nassumed one-body density, using the midpoint local density\nprescription [29]. This potential included the required effective\nmass correction to the imaginary part (Eq. (29) of Ref. [27])\ndiscussed in Refs. [30,31]. We use the conventional scale\nfactors for the computed real and imaginary parts of the optical\npotential, \u03bbV = 1.0 and \u03bbW = 0.8, required by an extended\nanalysis of data on light and medium mass targets [29]. We\ntake the 9Be matter density \u03c1(r) from Ref. [26], which is of\nthe harmonic oscillator form\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c10[1 + \u03b1x2] exp(\u2212x2), (33)\nwith x = r\/a. Given the values a = 1.77 fm and \u03b1 =\n0.631 [26] then \u03c10 = 0.1497 fm\u22123. We assume that the neutron\ndensity is \u03c1n(r) = N\u03c1(r)\/A, and similarly for \u03c1p(r).\nThe predictions of the JLM model for the p+9Be reaction\n[32] and n+9Be [33] total cross sections are compared with\navailable data in Fig. 2. The agreement is very reasonable in\nthe energy range of the data, and that of importance to the\nbeam energies of the reactions of interest. Since, at energies\nabove 20 MeV, the Coulomb interaction is unimportant for\nour light 9Be target, the p+9Be data provide support for the\napplicability of the JLM neutron-target optical potential and\nfor the 9Be density used.\n044606-5\nA.

Also shown are the\nresults including terms up to first (labeled 1) and second order\n(labeled 2) in the Bessel function expansion.\nV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nPublished elastic breakup and nucleon knockout cross\nsections from the TC model have usually been calculated\n[8,22] within the M-function approximation, Eq. (30), of\nSec. III B. We were able to reproduce in detail the calculations\npresented in Ref. [5,22] with the parameters stated there. The\nmore approximate approach, of retaining only the leading\n(zeroth-order) term of the asymptotic expansion of the Bessel\nfunction, Eq. (27), discussed in Sec. III A, was also used in\nsome early papers, e.g. [8]. We are now in a position to compare\nthe accuracy of these schemes using calculations that retain\nthe full Bessel function, through Eq. (23). All the subsequent\ncalculations are carried out using the common set of physical\nmodel parameters detailed in the previous section.\nIn Fig. 3 we present the zeroth-order, Eq. (27), M function,\nEq. (30), and full Bessel function, Eq. (23), approximations to\nd\u03c3\/dk1 for the 9Be[34Si,33Si(g.s.)]X reaction at 73 MeV per\nnucleon. The corresponding integrated partial cross sections\nare presented in Table I. Figure 3 also shows the results\nof calculations including terms up to first and second order\nin the Bessel function expansion. So as not to needlessly\ncomplicate the figure, the third-order calculation is not shown.\nHowever, it essentially coincides with the M-function curve\nfor small k1 and with the full Bessel function result (the\nupper solid curve) in the large k1 tail of this momentum\ndistribution.\nWe comment also that the convergence of the l2 (final-\nstate) partial wave sum in Eq. (23) is nontrivial and is very\nsensitive to the neutron-target interaction assumed. The rate\nof approach of Sl2 to unity and |Jl2 |2 to zero with increasing\nl2 in the summand is countered by rapidly increasing factors\nfrom the Bessel function and spherical harmonics. We found\nthat the sum converges when using Vtn models consistent with\nneutron-target data, such as the JLM optical model. Using\noptical model sets fitted to limited, low-energy data sets, such\nas from Ref. [34], the series was found to be divergent.\nThe M-function scheme is clearly a very significant\nimprovement on the zeroth-order Bessel function approach.\nIt is also clear that the different calculations are most sensitive\nto the different orders of approximation for k1 \u2248 0. This is to\nbe expected since the two approximate schemes are both large\n\u03b7 approximations and, for k1 = 0, \u03b7 is a minimum, Eq. (10).\nAs k1 grows, all the Bessel function approximations are seen\nto come together.\nSimilarly, since \u03b7 also increases with increasing sepa-\nration energy, Eq. (21), one might naively expect that the\napproximate TC models would agree better with the full\nBessel function calculation for more tightly bound sys-\ntems. However, the relevant expansion parameter is \u03b7b and\nwhich values of b contribute is determined by the product\nPel(b)|Km1\u2212m2 (\u03b7b)Yl1m1 (\u03b21, \u03c0 )|2. As is evident from Fig. 1,\nin the large |\bi |, tight binding limit only those b values\nfrom near-grazing core-target collisions will contribute. The\nunderlying TC requirement of an intermediate, external \u0006\nsurface then suggests that all calculations are less valid in this\nregime. In contrast, smaller |\bi | and greater spatial extension of\nthe exterior wave function favors contributions from larger b.\nThis sensitivity of the different (external) TC model ap-\nproximations to the neutron separation energy is illustrated\nby carrying out a second (model) calculation in which the\n33Si-neutron separation energy is arbitrarily reduced to just\n0.5 MeV, from 7.36 MeV. We note that in this case, Fig. 4,\nthe M-function approximation is actually further from the\nconverged Bessel function calculation than the second-order\nTABLE I.

The calculations for both \bi show that the zeroth-order\napproximation misses most of the cross section strength. This\ndependence of the accuracy of the M-function approximation\non the separation energy may have spectroscopic implications\nwhen comparisons are made with experimental data.\nAs can also be seen from Eq. (11), and is evident in our\nFig. 3, all of the TC models have a low k1 cutoff. This negative\nk1 bound is imposed by the \bf \u2192 0 limit in the numerator of\nthe expression\nk1 = [\bf + |\bi | \u2212 mv2\/2]\/h\u00afv, (34)\nand is seen to intrude within the physical region of the\npredicted and measured momentum distributions in cases\nwhere the d\u03c3\/dk1 distribution is broad, i.e., those cases with\ntight binding and\/or non-s-state transitions. This cutoff is\nan artifact of the model and results from its use of both\nsemiclassical dynamics and of external wave functions, which\nhave increased high momentum components compared with\nrealistic wave functions.\nAnother noticeable feature of the results in Figs. 3 and 4,\nwhich will be also evident for the 14C(1\u2212) transition, Fig. 6,\nis that the M-function scheme yields an enhanced tail to the\ncross section at the larger k1. To understand this feature the\nnature of the M-function scheme must be considered. As was\ndiscussed in Ref. [11], the M function arises from expanding\n(in \u03b7) only some of the terms that arise from the square of\nthe integral form of the Bessel function. Whether this scheme\nwill then yield bigger or smaller results than from the different\norders of the asymptotic expansion will depend on \u03b7. Figures 3\nand 4 show that with increasing k1 the M function d\u03c3\/dk1 is\nlargest. The M-function approximation thus exaggerates the\nhigh-k1 tail of d\u03c3\/dk1, that is, the low-momentum region of\nthe predicted core momentum distribution d\u03c3\/dp\u2016, Fig. 5. The\ncore parallel momentum (pc) dependence in the projectile rest\nframe is obtained from d\u03c3\/dk1, assuming pc = \u2212k1, and is\nthen boosted into the laboratory frame to give d\u03c3\/dp\u2016.\n11.8 11.9 12 12.1 12.2 12.3 12.4 12.5\np|| (GeV\/c)\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.25\n0.2\nd\u03c3\n\/d\np ||\n \n(ar\nbit\nrar\ny u\nnit\ns)\nExact\nM-function\nZeroth order\nFIG. 5.

In the 14C cases, the asymmetry in the g.s.\ntransition data is not reproduced, while for the 1\u2212 transition\nthe asymmetry in the TC calculation is not evident in the\ndata.

Those calculations\nused the all-order, non-DWBA, eikonal theory, supplemented\nfor the ground state transition by a fully-dynamical coupled\nchannels calculation of the diffractive component, and used\nthe same physical model inputs as were discussed in Sec. IV.\nThere, the calculated 14C single-particle partial cross sections\nwere \u03c3sp (g.s.) = 119 mb and \u03c3sp(1\u2212) = 28 mb, with deduced\nspectroscopic factors close to unity and close to the shell model\nvalues.\nSimilarly, for the 34Si transition, Fig. 5, the TC yields \u03c3sp =\n28 mb, almost a factor of 2 bigger than the (15 mb) value\nobtained using eikonal theory [5]. The momentum distribution\nreproduces the data only in the immediate vicinity of the peak,\nand some asymmetry can be seen. However, the agreement\nbetween experiment and calculation quickly disappears for\nmomenta away from those of the beam velocity, where the\nmomentum distribution predicted by Eq. (23) falls far more\nquickly than the experimental data.\nVI. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe transfer-to-the-continuum direct reaction model pro-\nvides an approximation to the DWBA description of elastic\nbreakup of a projectile, based on a [nucleon+core]+target\nthree-body model. The TC model has been shown to allow\napproximate calculations of both the elastic breakup and\none-nucleon stripping cross sections, of relevance to recent\nknockout reaction studies. Previously, additional simplifying\napproximations have been used, allowing essentially analytical\nforms for these cross sections. In the present work we have\ncalculated the TC amplitude more accurately, necessitating a\nnumerical approach, but avoiding the need for the usually-\nassumed simplifications.\nIn an attempt to clarify the accuracy of these TC model\nvariants we have compared the theoretical predictions with and\nwithout the often-made large \u03b7 simplifications. In particular\nwe have presented theoretical comparisons for three reactions\nwith different l and neutron separation energies. For all\ncalculations the two-body interactions have been chosen to be\nconsistent with the nucleon-target and core-target cross section\nsystematics, as were used in recent eikonal model analyses.\nOur results show that the predictions of the approximate\nversions of the TC theory are similar only for neutron removal\nfrom the l = 0,15C neutron halo system, with small neutron\nseparation energy. The M-function approximation is found\nto reliably reproduce the integrated partial cross sections of\nthe more accurate exact Bessel function calculations, but to\ndistort the momentum distribution, by moving strength to\nlower p\u2016. For all the transitions studied, the integrated partial\ncross sections are significantly larger than those calculated\nusing the all-order eikonal theory. In the present calculations\nspin-dependent distortions were excluded. Their effects on TC\ncalculations of both cross sections and spin observables will\nbe the subject of a subsequent paper.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the United Kingdom Engineer-\ning and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) through\nGrant No. GR\/M82141.\n[1] P.
