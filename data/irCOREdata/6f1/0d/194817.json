The missing XRB component\nhas a spectral shape that is consistent with a population of highly obscured active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) at redshifts \u223c0.5\u20131.5 and with absorption column densities of \u223c1023\u20131024 cm\u22122.\nKey words: surveys \u2013 galaxies: active \u2013 diffuse radiation \u2013 X-rays: diffuse background \u2013\nX-rays: galaxies.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe nature of the X-ray background (XRB) has been a subject of\ncontention since its discovery 40 years ago (Giacconi et al. 1962).\nIt is now clear that that at energies above \u223c1 keV the background\nis made up of the summed emission from point sources, princi-\npally active galactic nuclei (AGN). The spectrum measured by the\nHEAO satellite (Marshall et al. 1980) is similar in shape to 40 keV\nbremsstrahlung and is well described by a \u0002 = 1.4 power law from\n\u223c1 up to \u223c15 keV, where it starts to flatten off before peaking in\n\u03bdI \u03bd at \u223c30 keV. Below \u223c1 keV the background is dominated by\ndiffuse Galactic and local bubble emission; the purely extragalactic\ncomponent has not been well determined.\nResolving the XRB into discrete sources is crucial to understand-\ning the nature of the AGN and galaxy populations in the Universe.\nIt also allows us to place limits on the residual XRB emission\nwhich can be attributed to other processes, including that from\ntruly diffuse extragalactic emission. A significant amount (\u223c70\u2013\n80 per cent) of the 0.5\u20132 keV XRB was resolved into point sources\nby ROSAT (Hasinger et al. 1998), but progress at harder energies\nhas required the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution of the\nChandra and XMM\u2013Newton observatories. XMM\u2013Newton was able\n\u0001E-mail: maw@ast.cam.ac.uk\nto resolve some \u223c60 per cent of the 5\u201310 keV background in a\ndeep survey of the Lockman Hole, reaching a limiting flux of \u223c3 \u00d7\n10\u221215 erg cm\u22122s\u22121 in this band (Hasinger et al. 2001). The Chandra\nDeep Field North (CDF-N) and Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S)\nprobe down to \u223c1.4\u20132.8 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122s\u22121 (over 2\u20138 keV) and\nresolve \u223c70\u201390 per cent of the background in this broad, hard band\n(Giacconi et al. 2002; Moretti et al. 2002; Alexander et al. 2003;\nand references therein).\nThe large resolved fractions found in the deep surveys appear\nto solve the problem of the origin of the XRB in terms of known\nsources; an extrapolation of the 0.5\u20132 keV band log N\u2013log S dis-\ntribution points to an integrated flux consistent with the full XRB\nlevel. The substantial resolved fraction in the broad 2\u201310 keV band\nis not entirely consistent with this picture; a similar extrapolation\nof the 2\u201310 keV log N\u2013log S distribution is, at most, only able to ac-\ncount for some 93 per cent of the total XRB and is only marginally\nconsistent with complete resolution (Moretti et al. 2003). The most\nrecent XRB intensity measurement by De Luca & Molendi (2004)\nwould make the fraction only \u223c80 per cent.\nTo investigate in detail the resolved XRB fraction as a function of\nenergy, Worsley et al. (2004) carried out a source-stacking analysis\nof \u223c700 ks of accumulated XMM\u2013Newton exposure in the Lock-\nman Hole. Source photometry was used to determine the resolved\nfraction in a number of narrow energy bands from 0.2 to 12 keV.\nThe authors found the resolved fraction to be \u000280 per cent below\n2 keV, but that this decreased significantly at higher energies, falling\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1282 M. A. Worsley et al.\nto only \u223c50 per cent above \u223c8 keV. The failure to account for XRB\nin the harder bands, along with recent indications of steepening of\nX-ray source number counts at low fluxes, suggest that there may\nbe an as yet undetected population of highly obscured sources, such\nas the heavily absorbed AGN predicted in recent synthesis models\n(e.g. Gilli, Salvati & Hasinger 2001; Franceschini, Braito & Fadda\n2002; Gandhi & Fabian 2003; Ueda et al. 2003; Comastri 2004).\nAlthough Chandra has low effective area at energies exceeding\n7 keV, the Chandra Deep Fields (CDFs) probe to fainter flux lim-\nits than the XMM\u2013Newton Lockman Hole observation. We use the\nCDFs to assess whether the contribution of the fainter sources found\nby Chandra is able to resolve the discrepancy and account for the\nmissing background fraction. Using a similar photometric analysis,\nwe sum the flux from resolved CDF sources in a number of narrow\nenergy bands to determine the resolved fraction of the XRB. We\nalso present a re-analysis of the XMM\u2013Newton Lockman Hole ob-\nservation (Worsley et al. 2004), carried out in identical energy bands\nfor direct comparison with the CDFs. In both cases, we attempt to\nquantify and correct for field-to-field variations and the missing flux,\nwhich would arise from the very bright sources that are not sampled\nin these deep, pencil-beam surveys.\n2 S O U R C E D E T E C T I O N A N D P H OTO M E T RY\n2.1 Chandra deep field observations\nChandra has performed the two deepest ever surveys of the X-\nray Universe: the 2-Ms CDF-N (Alexander et al. 2003) and the\n1-Ms CDF-S (Giacconi et al. 2002). The CDF-N probes down to\n\u223c2.5 \u00d7 10\u221217 and \u223c1.4 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122s\u22121 in the 0.5\u20132 and 2\u2013\n8 keV bands, respectively. Although the CDF-S only reaches down\nto equivalent limits [at signal-to-noise ratio (S\/N ) = 3] of \u223c5.2 \u00d7\n10\u221217 and \u223c2.8 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122s\u22121, these are both well beyond\nthe 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122s\u22121 break in the log N \u2013 log S distribution (see\ne.g. Hasinger et al. 1998; Campana et al. 2001).\nFor both the CDF-N and CDF-S, we use the source catalogues\nand photometry from Alexander et al. (2003), who describe their\napproach thoroughly; we include a brief summary here for com-\npleteness. The 2-Ms CDF-N main point-source catalogue contains\na total of 503 sources and covers a total solid angle of 447.8 arcmin2.\nConservative estimates place the number of falsely detected sources\nto be as high as 20\u201330, but the true number is probably considerably\nlower (see section 2.3 in Alexander et al. 2003). The CDF-S has 326\nsources from a total field of 391.3 arcmin2.\nThe local background estimate for each source was determined\nin an annulus surrounding the source-extraction region. The mean\nnumber of background counts was computed assuming a Poisson\ndistribution, as n1\/n0; where n1 is the number of pixels contain-\ning a single count and n0 is the number containing no counts. For\nsources with less than 103 counts in the full 0.5\u20138 keV band, source-\nextraction apertures containing 90\u201395 per cent of the encircled\nenergy fraction (EEF) were chosen (with the extracted counts cor-\nrected up to 100 per cent). For sources brighter than 103 counts,\nextraction apertures of twice this size were chosen; the EEF in these\ncases is close to 100 per cent. The EEF corrections used to cor-\nrect from aperture counts to total counts were calculated from the\nChandra point spread function (PSF) determined using the Chandra\nX-ray Center MKPSF software (refer to Alexander et al. 2003).\nFor all sources with a sufficient number of counts, the ratio of\ncounts between the 2\u20138 keV and 0.5\u20132 keV bands was used to de-\ntermine an effective spectral index for a power-law model, allowing\nfor Galactic absorption of (1.3 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 1020 and (8.8 \u00b1 4.0) \u00d7\n1019 cm\u22122 for the CDF-N and CDF-S, respectively (Lockman 2003;\nStark et al. 1992). For sources with an insufficient number of counts,\nthe photon index is fixed at \u0002 = 1.4 (the approximate average for all\nthe sources and the slope of the XRB). The flux for each source was\ncalculated in a number of photometric bands, regardless of whether\nor not the source is actually detected in each of the bands. In each\ncase, the counts-to-flux conversion is appropriate to the spectral in-\ndex of the source. The photometric bands used were 0.5\u20131, 1\u20132,\n2\u20134, 4\u20136 and 6\u20138 keV.\nPrior to our stacking analysis (described in Section 3.1), we\napplied the systematic flux correction determined by Bauer et al.\n(2004) for both the CDFs (see section 3 and fig. 2 of their paper).\nThese take into account Eddington bias as well as some further\naperture\/photometry effects that were not considered originally. The\ncorrection is negligible except in the harder (>2 keV) bands, which\neach see an increase in total resolved flux of \u223c2\u20135 per cent.\n2.2 XMM\u2013Newton Lockman Hole observations\nXMM\u2013Newton, whilst unable to match the X-ray resolution and\nultimate sensitivity of Chandra, has the critical advantage of sensi-\ntivity in the 8\u201312 keV regime. It was this capability, put into effect\nwith \u223c700 ks of deep observations in the Lockman Hole (XMM-\nLockman Hole, XMM-LH), that prompted Worsley et al. (2004) to\ninvestigate the resolved fraction of the XRB with energy.\nThe 17 different individual observations that comprise the XMM-\nLH were combined and source detection carried out using sliding-\nbox detection followed by maximum-likelihood PSF fitting. Vi-\nsual inspection of the source candidates was used to exclude\nspurious detections. The analysis was restricted to the central\n314.2-arcmin2 region of the field with the highest exposure time\nand lowest background level.\nIn a similar approach to that taken in the CDFs, simple aperture\nphotometry was performed on the exposure-corrected images in a\nnumber of narrow energy bands. A more detailed description of the\nfollowing is given by Worsley et al. (2004). For each source, the total\ncount rates were extracted in both a circular aperture and a surround-\ning annulus. These were then used to calculate the background-\ncorrected source count rate, taking into account corrections for the\nEEF. These corrections were calculated by integrating an analytical\nmodel of the XMM\u2013Newton PSF given in XMM\u2013Newton Science\nOperations Centre calibration documents (refer to Worsley et al.\n2004). Count-rate extraction apertures\/annuli were chosen to the\nmaximize the signal-to-noise ratio.\nCount-rate\u2013to\u2013flux conversion factors were computed assuming\na fixed spectral slope of \u0002 = 1.4 and Galactic absorption with a\ncolumn density of 5 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 (Lockman, Jahoda & McCammon\n1986). This is not as rigorous as the approach taken in the CDFs\nwhere counts-to-flux energy conversion factors (ECFs) appropriate\nto the spectral slope of the source were used, but the larger count-rate\nerrors for the XMM\u2013Newton sources prohibit this and the assumption\nof a fixed \u0002 = 1.4 is more reliable. Furthermore, the dependence of\nthe ECFs on the spectral shape of a source is only weak because of\nthe use of narrow energy bands.

Additionally, rather than\nuse the original source list (from Worsley et al. 2004), of 126 ob-\njects, we took advantage of the complete (and more rigorously com-\npiled) Lockman Hole source catalogue of Mateos et al. (in prepara-\ntion), which contains 156 sources in the same 314.2-arcmin2 region.\nTable 1 gives the values of various important parameters used in the\nre-processing of the data.\n3 R E S U LT S\n3.1 Resolving the X-ray background\nThe total resolved flux in each energy band was calculated by sum-\nming the measured flux for each source. Every source is included\nregardless of whether or not it is detected in the band. This was\ndone for the CDF-N, CDF-S and each of the three XMM\u2013Newton\ninstruments in the XMM-LH. Appropriate corrections for Galactic\nabsorption were made. These correction factors are: 15 per cent\nin the XMM-LH 0.2\u20130.5 keV band; 2.6, 7.2 and 4.8 per cent in the\n0.5\u20131 keV band for the XMM-LH, CDF-N and CDF-S, respectively;\nand \u00011 per cent for all of the harder bands.\nIn order to calculate the resolved intensity, the flux from each\nsource must be divided by a solid angle on the sky. In the case of the\nXMM-LH, the sensitivity is approximately constant over the region\nconsidered here and we simply take the solid angle to be a constant\n314.2 arcmin2. The CDFs, however, show a substantial increase in\nsensitivity towards the centre of the fields. The total solid angles of\n447.8 and 391.3 arcmin2 are only applicable to the brightest sources,\nwhereas fainter sources are only detectable over a fraction of the field\nand the actual solid angles are smaller. Fig. 19 in Alexander et al.\n(2003) shows the solid angle as a function of 0.5-8 keV source flux in\nthe CDF-N. We use this function (and its equivalent for the CDF-S)\nto provide the appropriate solid angle when converting each source\nflux to an intensity. We impose a minimum effective area of 10 per\ncent of the total to avoid catastrophically magnifying the errors in\nthe fluxes from the faintest sources.\nFig. 1(a) shows the resolved XRB fraction obtained in each energy\nband. The fractions are calculated using the most recent estimates\nof the total extragalactic XRB spectrum. For the 1\u20138 keV band,\nthis is the power-law model of De Luca & Molendi (2004), with a\nspectral slope of \u0002 = 1.41 and 1 keV normalization of 11.6 keV\ncm\u22122s\u22121sr\u22121keV\u22121. Above 8 keV, the background spectrum starts\nto turn over slightly and so here we use the analytical model of\nGruber et al. (1999), which takes the downturn into account, but\nFigure 1.

A. Worsley et al.\nrenormalized to the same 2\u20138 keV XRB flux as found by De Luca\n& Molendi (2004). The spectrum of the purely extragalactic back-\nground is not well constrained below 1 keV because it is difficult to\nseparate from the bright, diffuse, Galactic component. There is evi-\ndence to suggest that the spectrum of the background steepens below\n\u223c1 keV; Roberts & Warwick (2001) have combined the results of\nseveral X-ray shadowing measurements and report a background\nintensity of 26.6 \u00b1 4.8 keV cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121keV\u22121 at 0.25 keV. A\npower-law fit between this value and the De Luca & Molendi (2004)\nintensity at 1 keV gives a spectral slope of \u0002 \u223c 1.5\u20131.7, and we use\nthis to estimate the background levels in the 0.2\u20130.5 and 0.5\u20131 keV\nbands.\nThe stacking of source fluxes reveals a decline in the resolved\nXRB fraction as a function of energy. Below \u223c2 keV, the data di-\nverge somewhat, presumably as a result of field-to-field variations.\nSuch variations arise through the cosmic variance in the actual XRB\nnormalization in different regions of the sky, along with the statisti-\ncal noise, which is a consequence of sampling a discrete population\nof sources in a small solid angle. Fig. 1(b) shows the result of ex-\ncluding sources with a 0.5\u20138 keV band flux >5 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122\ns\u22121 from the sum. While only a small number of sources have been\nremoved (from 3\u20137 out of 156\u2013503), the variation at the softest en-\nergies has been reduced considerably. This demonstrates that a large\namount of the variation <2 keV is the result of soft, bright sources.\nThe XMM-LH data now show a slight decline in the resolved frac-\ntion whilst the CDFs show a slight rise, although both CDFs show\nsignificant drops in the 6\u20138 keV band. This difference between the\nXMM\u2013Newton and Chandra fractions in the 4\u20136 keV band is the re-\nsult of sensitivity: the CDFs probe down to fainter fluxes where the\ntypical source spectrum is harder than \u0002 = 1.4 (see e.g. Alexander\net al. 2003; Streblyanska et al. 2004). If the source lists are further\nrestricted to remove the faint sources seen only by Chandra, with a\nminimum flux requirement of 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, then the spectral\nshapes of the sources are similar for both XMM-LH and CDF, see\nFig. 1(c). Of course, there will always remain differences between\ndata sets: Barcons, Mateos & Ceballos (2000) estimate the cosmic\nvariation in XRB normalization to be of order \u223c10 per cent for fields\nof \u00011 deg2.\n3.2 Correcting for the bright-end population\nThe brightest sources in the catalogues have 0.5\u20138 keV fluxes up to\n\u223c(1\u20133) \u00d7 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. There is a non-negligible contribution\nto the whole-sky background by sources brighter than this; in fact,\naround 15\u201320 per cent of the total XRB is the result of bright, rare\nsources that are not sampled in pencil-beam surveys. A bright-end\ncorrection is necessary to recover this missing intensity.\nIn order to remove some of the bright-end variation, we truncate\nthe source lists above 5 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121(0.5\u20138 keV band).\nThis is the same truncation as used in Fig. 1(b) and corresponds to\nremoving sources that only occur with densities of \u223c a few in the\n\u223c0.1-deg2 CDF and XMM-LH fields. With the bright-end sources\nremoved, the expected missing flux can be estimated by integrating\nknown log N\u2013log S distributions. These are available in the broad\n0.5\u20132 and 2\u201310 keV bands but not in the narrow bands used in this\nwork. In order to calculate the contribution in a narrow band, it is\nnecessary to assume the spectral shape of the sources. Here, we\nassume a power-law spectrum but the typical spectral slope of such\na power-law can be a strong function of source flux.\nA number of studies point to significant evolution of the spectral\nshape with flux (Ueda et al. 1999; Alexander et al. 2003; Fiore\net al. 2003; Streblyanska et al. 2004), with sources brighter than\n\u223c10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 having typical spectral slopes much softer\nthan the \u0002 = 1.4 of the total background. Shallow surveys (see\ne.g. Ueda et al. 1999) find that the brightest sources, with X-ray\nfluxes \u000210\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, have spectral slopes of \u0002 \u223c 1.8\u20132.2.\nStreblyanska et al. (2004) fitted a power-law spectrum to the stacked\nspectra of sources of a 500-ks XMM\u2013Newton observation in the\nCDF-S. Fitting the hard band (1\u20138 keV) with a power law reveals\na strong correlation between spectral slope and flux, with \u0002 \u223c 1.8\nfor \u223c10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (2\u201310 keV flux) decreasing to \u0002 \u223c 1.5 at\n\u223c10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and \u0002 \u223c 1.2 at \u223c10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121. Alexander\net al. (2003) see sources with \u0002 \u223c 1 at fluxes \u000110\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\nin the CDF-N.\nWe haven taken a linear fit to the evolution of spectral index with\nflux based on the relationship as observed by Streblyanska et al.\n(2004), although we conservatively impose a maximum value of\n\u0002 = 2. Such a model is only an approximation to the actual depen-\ndence of spectral shape on flux. It does, however, follow the trends\nobserved by Streblyanska et al. (2004) in the CDF-S (using both\nXMM\u2013Newton and Chandra observations) and Ueda et al. (1999)\nusing the ASCA Medium-Sensitivity Survey and, whilst crude, it is\nimportant to take into account the fact that the bright-end correction\nis the result of sources that are significantly softer than those that\nwe have already stacked. Given our model, the bright-source con-\ntribution in each of the 2\u20134, 4\u20136, 6\u20138 and 8\u201312 keV narrow bands\ncan then be calculated, using an appropriate spectral index at each\nsource flux, from the 2\u201310 keV flux contribution obtained by inte-\ngrating the Moretti et al. (2003) hard band log N\u2013log S distribution\n(the most complete published to date).\nCorrecting the soft bands (0.2\u20130.5, 0.5\u20131 and 1\u20132 keV) is more\ncomplex, because the shape of the background is not well con-\nstrained. The source stacking approach of Streblyanska et al. (2004)\nin the 0.4\u20138 keV range revealed a systematically softer spectrum\nthan that seen for 1\u20138 keV (an increase in \u0002 of \u223c0.1). No stud-\nies cover the 0.5\u20132 keV range ideally required for the soft band\nbright-end correction so we take the same linear fit to the evolu-\ntion of spectral index as used in the hard band, but with an increase\nin \u0002 by 0.1. We use the Moretti et al. (2003) 0.5\u20132 keV soft band\nlog N \u2013 log S distribution. There is now some evidence to suggest\nthat the Moretti et al. (2003) log N \u2013 log S slope is too steep at\nthe bright end compared with results from the RIXOS,1 RBS2 and\nNEPS3 surveys (Mason et al. 2000; Schwope et al. 2000; Gioia\net al. 2003); thus, our bright-end correction in the soft band could\npotentially be an underestimate.\nFig. 2 shows the bright-end corrected resolved background frac-\ntions. The XMM-LH, CDF-S and CDF-N are all consistent with a\nsimilar resolved fraction of \u223c70\u201390 per cent up to \u223c4 keV. The dif-\nferences are of order \u223c10 per cent, which is not inconsistent with\nwhat would be expected from cosmic variance between the fields\n(see Barcons et al. 2000). XMM\u2013Newton sees a drop in the resolved\nfraction in the 4\u20136 keV band, whereas the CDFs are still consistent\nwith a high resolved fraction of \u223c80\u201390 per cent. This difference\nis a result of the faint, hard sources, which are not detected in the\nXMM-LH; if these sources are removed from the Chandra data then\nall three data sets show agreement in the 4\u20136 keV fraction. Most\nimportantly, the picture is different at high energies; XMM\u2013Newton\nand both CDFs only resolve \u223c50\u201370 per cent of the background\nin the 6\u20138 keV band, much less than the fraction at lower energies.\nThe 8\u201312 keV band, as probed by XMM\u2013Newton, is only \u223c40\u2013\n60 per cent resolved.\n1 ROSAT International X-Ray\/Optical Survey.\n2 ROSAT Bright Survey.\n3 ROSAT North Elliptical Pole Survey.\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 357, 1281\u20131287\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nThe unresolved hard X-ray background 1285\nFigure 2.

Such high fractions are often used to claim\nthat the XRB is almost completely resolved into discrete sources\neven in the broad 2\u201310 keV band. Our results suggest that stating a\nresolved fraction in this manner is misleading, because it is the high\nresolved fractions in the 2\u20136 keV range that are dominating the total,\nwhilst the resolved fraction beyond 6 keV is significantly lower.\n4 D I S C U S S I O N\nThree independent observations now point to a significant reduction\nin the resolved fraction of the XRB at the hardest energies.

The grey contours indicate the maxi-\nmum, unobscured, rest-frame 2\u201310 keV luminosity (erg s\u22121) of the source\npopulation required such that the sources remain below the sensitivity limit\n(estimated at \u223c1.5 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in a 4\u20138 keV band).\nNewton starts to see a downturn above \u223c4 keV, whilst Chandra is\nsensitive to the fainter, harder sources, which fill in some of the\nmissing fraction and push the downturn to energies \u00026 keV. The\nmissing fraction has the spectral signature of highly obscured AGN\nand could be evidence of the large population of heavily absorbed\nobjects that are thought to account for the 30 keV peak of XRB\nintensity (see e.g. Maiolino et al. 1998, 2003).\nTo quantify the possible nature of an undetected population, we\nmodelled the spectral shape of the unresolved background as a func-\ntion of redshift and intrinsic absorption column density. A grid of\nspectra was built in the range z = 0.1\u20133 and N H = 1022\u20131025 cm\u22122.\nXSPEC V11.3.1 was used to generate the spectra using a PEXRAV model\n(Magdziarz & Zdziarski 1995), with a \u0002 = 2 power law and an\nR = 1 reflection component (see e.g. Malizia et al. 2003), multiplied\nby ZWABS (Morrison & McCammon 1983) photoelectric absorption\nat the source redshift.\nWe computed the goodness-of-fit between each model spectrum\nand the residual XRB spectrum (i.e. the difference between the re-\nsolved and total backgrounds). Fig. 3 shows the confidence contours\nin the redshift and absorption column density required to account for\nthe shape of the missing AGN population for the XMM-LH. This is\na rather simplistic approximation to the spectra of highly obscured\nsources; specifically, we neglect the effects of iron K emission and\nscattered-flux components, as well as assuming that the missing\nsources occur at a fixed redshift and with a fixed absorption col-\numn density. Nevertheless, some generalized conclusions about the\nnature of the unresolved population can be drawn.\nThe XMM-LH, CDF-N and CDF-S all show similar contour dia-\ngrams for the characteristics of the missing source population. The\nXMM-LH data, which extends to the 8\u201312 keV band, shows the most\nconstrained set of contours although the degeneracy between low\nz\/low NH and high z\/high NH is clear. The best-fitting point is at\nz \u223c 0.8 and N H \u223c 4.5 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122.

The intensity resolved into sources in the CDF-N,\nCDF-S and XMM-LH are shown as black crosses, grey crosses and black\ndiamonds, respectively. The lower curve shows the spectrum of the best-\nfitting model for the missing AGN population with z = 0.8 and N H = 4.5 \u00d7\n1023 cm\u22122. Sharp features (such as that due to iron at 4 keV), is a consequence\nof our assumption that the missing population is composed entirely of AGN\nwith this spectrum. In reality the missing population will be mixture of\nsources at different redshifts and with different levels of absorption; any\nsharp features will be smeared out.\nWe conclude that whilst the data are unable to constrain tightly\nthe spectral shape of the missing XRB sources, the most plausible\npopulation would seem to be of objects at redshifts of \u223c0.5\u20131.5, with\nunabsorbed luminosities of\u0001 5 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121, but heavily obscured\nby column densities of \u223c1023\u20131024 cm\u22122. The CDFs probe deeper\nthan the XMM-LH but still fail to detect the missing sources in the\n2\u20134 keV band, or our stacking analysis would have revealed the\nhigher energy emission. Any soft starburst or scattered emission in\nthese objects must be small and this may suggest a high covering\nfraction for the absorption.\nIn order to provide the missing fraction of the hard XRB, these\nsources must have a density on the sky of\u00022800 deg\u22122. This would\ncorrespond to a lower limit of around 350 undetected AGN in the\nCDF-N. There must therefore be >3 times more undetected, ob-\nscured sources than detected, unobscured ones, in the 4\u20138 keV band.\nThis requires that the sources in the new population have a high cov-\nering fraction of obscuring matter.\nFrom the absorption-corrected flux, we can estimate the black\nhole mass density of this obscured population to be (6\u20139 \u00d7 104)\n\u0004\u22121\u22121\u03ba\u22121 M\u0003 Mpc\u22123; where \u0004\u22121 is the accretion efficiency in units\nof 0.1 and \u03ba\u22121 is a bolometric correction in units of 0.1. We have used\na similar calculation to Fabian & Iwasawa (1999) although note that\nthe bolometric correction is \u223c10\u201315 for our lower luminosity ob-\njects (Fabian 2004). The missing population thus accounts for \u223c10\u2013\n20 per cent of the local black hole mass density of 4\u20135 \u00d7 105 M\u0003\nMpc\u22123 (see e.g. Shankar et al. 2004), the rest of which is the re-\nsult of bright AGN and, in particular, quasars, where the bolometric\ncorrection is \u223c30 or more and where a typical redshift of z \u223c 2 is\nmore appropriate (refer to Fabian & Iwasawa 1999 and references\ntherein).\nThe steepness of the 5\u201310 keV source number counts, with no\nevidence for a break to a flatter slope at the faint end, also indicates\nthat there remains a substantial number of objects that have yet\nto be found in this band (Hasinger et al. 2001; Baldi et al. 2002;\nRosati et al. 2002). Recent optical and infrared data from the HST\nand Spitzer telescopes, acquired as part of the Great Observatories\nOrigins Deep Survey (GOODS) project, are also providing evidence\nfor large numbers of obscured AGN at z > 1 (e.g. Treister et al.\n2004). Deep, multiwavelength efforts such as GOODS may well\nbe the best way to identify the missing population; confirmation\nof Compton-thick objects will ultimately require X-ray missions\nwith high sensitivities beyond 10 keV, such as the next generation\nof focusing hard X-ray telescopes.\n5 C O N C L U S I O N S\n(i) Whilst the XRB is \u223c85 and \u223c80 per cent resolved in the broad\n0.5\u20132 and 2\u201310 keV bands respectively (depending on XRB normal-\nization), it is only \u223c60 per cent resolved above \u223c6 keV and \u223c50\nper cent resolved above \u223c8 keV. This decrease in resolved fraction\nis seen in both the CDFs and the XMM-LH.\n(ii) The decrease in resolved fraction as seen in XMM-LH occurs\nat energies \u00024 keV, whilst in the CDFs the drop occurs at \u00026 keV.\nThis difference is the result of faint, hard sources, which are de-\ntected in CDFs but not the XMM-LH. All three surveys are unable\nto account for almost half of the XRB above \u223c6 keV.\n(iii) The missing fraction has a spectral shape that is consistent\nwith that which would be expected from a population of faint, heav-\nily obscured AGN located at a redshift of \u223c0.5\u20131.5 and with intrinsic\nabsorption columns of \u223c1023\u20131024 cm\u22122.\n(iv) The deep CDF data show that any such obscured population\nis not detected in the 2\u20134 keV band, or our stacking analysis would\nhave revealed the higher energy emission; consequently, any soft\nscattered or starburst emission from these objects must be small.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nBased on observations with XMM\u2013Newton, an ESA science mission\nwith instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member\nStates and the USA (NASA).
