We incorporate this\nmechanism in a two-channel eikonal model to make an essentially parameter-free estimate\nof diffractive dijet production at the Tevatron, given the diffractive structure functions\nmeasured at HERA. The estimates are in surprising agreement with the measurements\nof the CDF collaboration. We briefly discuss the application of the model to other hard\nprocesses with rapidity gaps.\n1 Introduction\nThere has been much interest in the probability of rapidity gaps in high energy interactions to\nsurvive, since they may be populated by secondary particles generated by rescattering processes,\nsee, for example, [1]\u2013[8]. The effect can be described in terms of screening or absorptive\ncorrections. To the best of our knowledge, the term survival probability was introduced by\nBjorken [2] who estimated the probability using\nS2 =\n\u222b |M(s, b)|2 e\u2212\u2126(b) d2b\u222b |M(s, b)|2 d2b , (1)\nwhere M is the amplitude (in impact parameter b space) of the particular process of interest\nat centre-of-mass energy\n\u221a\ns. \u2126 is the opacity (or optical density) of the interaction of the\nincoming hadrons1.\nIt is perhaps more accurate to use the term \u201csuppression factor\u201d of a hard process ac-\ncompanied by a rapidity gap, rather than \u201csurvival probability\u201d. It depends not only on the\nprobability of the initial state to survive, but is sensitive to the spatial distribution of par-\ntons inside the incoming hadrons, and thus on the dynamics of the whole diffractive part of\nthe scattering matrix. It is important to note that the suppression factor S2 is not universal,\nbut depends on the particular hard subprocess, as well as the kinematical configurations. In\nparticular, S2 depends on the nature of the colour-singlet (Pomeron or W\/Z boson or photon)\nexchange which generates the gap as well as on the distributions of partons inside the proton\nin impact parameter space [9, 10, 11, 12]. In this paper we emphasize the importance of the\ndependence on the characteristic momentum fractions carried by the active partons in the col-\nliding hadrons. This leads to a much richer structure of the probability of rapidity gaps in\nprocesses mediated by colour-singlet t-channel exchange. The framework was introduced long\nago2 [15, 16], but only with the advent of rapidity gap events being observed in hard processes\nat the Tevatron and at HERA, is this rich physics now revealing itself.\nIn Section 2 we briefly review the general framework, and, in particular, discuss a two-\nchannel partonic model of diffraction. Measurements of diffractive dijet production with a\nleading antiproton have been made recently by the CDF collaboration [17] at the Tevatron.\nThis is an ideal process with which to compare the specific predictions of the models for high\nenergy diffraction. In Section 3 we specify the partonic structure of the diffractive two-channel\neigenstates. To set the scene for our main study we first, in Section 4, discuss diffractive dijet\nproduction assuming, for the moment, that rescattering corrections may be neglected. As was\nemphasised in Ref. [17], the calculation of the cross section, based on factorization in terms of\ndiffractive structure functions obtained from HERA data, indicates a large discrepancy with the\nCDF measurements \u2014 both in the normalisation and in the shape of the observed distribution.\n1That is i[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u2126\/2)] is the usual elastic scattering amplitude in impact parameter space. \u2126\/2 is\nfrequently called the eikonal.\n2Reviews can be found, for example, in Refs. [13, 14].\n1\nThe calculation lies about a factor of 10 above the data; the precise discrepancy depends on\nthe kinematic domain. In Section 5 we include rescattering corrections. Clearly these will\ndecrease the predictions, since now the rapidity gaps may be populated by secondary particles.\nTo allow for rescattering we use the two-channel eikonal model, reviewed in Sections 2 and\n3, with parameters previously determined in a global description of the total, elastic and soft\ndiffractive data available in the ISR to Tevatron energy range [9]. In this way we are able to\nmake an essentially parameter-free prediction of both the normalisation and the shape of the\nCDF diffractive dijet data. In Section 6 we discuss the application of the model to other hard\nprocesses with rapidity gaps, but on a less quantitative level than for dijet production. In all\ncases the specific rescattering corrections are in the direction to improve the description of the\ndata. Finally, in Section 7, we present our conclusions.\n2 Inelastic diffraction and diffractive eigenstates\nIn order to deduce the behaviour of inelastic diffraction, we start with the s-channel unitarity\nrelation, which interrelates the proton-proton total cross section, elastic and inelastic scattering.\nThe unitarity relation is, in fact, valid at each value of the impact parameter separately, that\nis\n2Im Tfi =\n\u2211\nn\nT \u2217nf Tni, (2)\nwhere Tfi(s, b) is the transition amplitude to go from state i to state f .\nWe follow a presentation by Pumplin [14], after the original interpretation of Good and\nWalker [15]. First we introduce states \u03c6k which diagonalize the diffractive part of the T matrix.\nSuch eigenstates of diffraction only undergo elastic scattering. Let us denote the orthogonal\nmatrix which diagonalizes Im T by C, so that\nIm T = CFCT with \u3008\u03c6k|F |\u03c6j\u3009 = Fj \u03b4jk. (3)\nNow consider the diffractive dissociation of an arbitrary incoming state\n|i\u3009 = \u2211\nk\nCik |\u03c6k\u3009. (4)\nThe elastic scattering amplitude for this state satisfies\n\u3008i|Im T |i\u3009 = \u2211\nk\n|Cik|2 Fk = \u3008F \u3009, (5)\nwhere Fk \u2261 \u3008\u03c6k|F |\u03c6k\u3009 and where the brackets of \u3008F \u3009 mean the average of F over the initial\nprobability distribution of diffractive eigenstates. After the diffractive scattering described by\nTfi, the final state |f\u3009 will, in general, be a different superposition of eigenstates than those of\n2\n|i\u3009 shown in (4). Suppose for simplicity, we neglect the real parts of the diffractive amplitudes,\nthen\nd\u03c3tot\nd2b\n= 2 Im\u3008i|T |i\u3009 = 2 \u2211\nk\n|Cik|2 Fk = 2\u3008F \u3009\nd\u03c3el\nd2b\n= |\u3008i|T |i\u3009|2 =\n(\u2211\nk\n|Cik|2 Fk\n)2\n= \u3008F \u30092 (6)\nd\u03c3el + SD\nd2b\n=\n\u2211\nk\n|\u3008\u03c6k|T |i\u3009|2 =\n\u2211\nk\n|Cik|2 F 2k = \u3008F 2\u3009.\nIt follows that the cross section for the single diffractive dissociation of a proton,\nd\u03c3SD\nd2b\n= \u3008F 2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008F \u30092, (7)\nis given by the statistical dispersion in the absorption probabilities of the diffractive eigenstates.\nNote that if all the components \u03c6k of the incoming diffractive state |i\u3009 were absorbed\nequally then the diffracted superposition would be proportional to the incident one and again\nthe inelastic diffraction would be zero. Thus if, at very high energies, the amplitudes Fk at\nsmall impact parameters are equal to the black disk limit, Fk = 1, then diffractive production\nwill be equal to zero in this impact parameter domain and so will only occur in the peripheral\nb region. This behaviour has already occurred in pp (and pp\u00af) interactions at Tevatron energies.\nOn the other hand, if there are, say, two diffractive channels with different eigenvalues, then\nthe amount of inelastic diffraction increases with the spacing of the two eigenvalues.\nFor instance, consider just two diffractive channels [18, 12, 9] (say, p,N\u2217), and assume, for\nsimplicity, that the elastic scattering amplitudes for the two channels are equal. Then the T\nmatrix has the form\nIm T = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u2126\/2, (8)\nwhere the eikonal matrix \u2126 has elements\n\u2126fif \u2032i\u2032 = \u21260 \u03c9\nfi \u03c9f \u2032i\u2032 . (9)\nThe individual \u03c9 matrices, which correspond to transitions from the two incoming hadrons,\neach have the form\n\u03c9 =\n(\n1 \u03b3\n\u03b3 1\n)\n. (10)\nThe parameter \u03b3(s, b) determines the ratio of the inelastic to elastic transitions. The overall\ncoupling \u21260 is also a function of the energy\n\u221a\ns and the impact parameter b.\nWith the above form of \u03c9, the diffractive eigenstates are\n|\u03c61\u3009 = 1\u221a\n2\n(|p\u3009+ |N\u2217\u3009) , |\u03c62\u3009 = 1\u221a\n2\n(|p\u3009 \u2212 |N\u2217\u3009) . (11)\n3\nIn this basis, the eikonal has the diagonal form\n\u2126mnm\u2032n\u2032 = \u21260 r\nmn rm\u2032n\u2032 , (12)\nwhere m,n = \u03c61, \u03c62 and\nr =\n(\n1 + \u03b3 0\n0 1\u2212 \u03b3\n)\n. (13)\nIn the case where \u03b3 is close to unity, \u03b3 = 1\u2212 \u03b5, one of the eigenvalues is small.\n3 Parton configurations of the diffractive eigenstates\nThe simple two-channel model of Section 2 allows the prominent features of hard diffractive\nprocesses to be explained, which are beyond the scope of the single channel eikonal. First we\nnote that the parameter \u03b3, which determines the ratio of inelastic to elastic transitions, needs\nto be in the range 0.4\u20130.6 to be in accord with the experimental data on diffractive dissociation\nat moderate energies. Thus we know that there will be a big difference (1\u00b1\u03b3) in the absorptive\ncross sections for scattering in the two diffractive eigenstates. To be specific, in this work we\nuse the results of the detailed analysis of the elastic and soft diffractive data that was presented\nin Refs. [9, 10]. There \u03b3 was taken to be 0.4.\nIn QCD the diagonal states correspond to quark and gluon configurations with different\ntransverse coordinates3. For small transverse size r such (colourless) configurations interact as\nsmall colour dipoles with total interaction cross sections \u223c r2. Thus, to a rough approximation,\nwe can separate all the parton configurations of the colliding hadrons into those with small size\nand those with large size. In our two-channel example above these would correspond to the\nstates |\u03c62\u3009 and |\u03c61\u3009 respectively.\nIt is informative to discuss the phenomenon in terms of the usual Reggeon diagrams. Assume\nthat some \u201chard\u201d diffractively produced state4 \u201ch\u201d is strongly coupled to state |\u03c62\u3009 and weakly\nto |\u03c61\u3009. It follows from (11) that the Pomeron couplings of h to p and N\u2217 satisfy\ngIPph = \u2212gIPN\u2217h, (14)\nand that the p and N\u2217 intermediate states for double-Pomeron exchange contribution (Fig. 1)\ninterfere destructively, since\ngIPpp g\nIP\nph + g\nIP\npN\u2217 g\nIP\nN\u2217h = g\nIP\npp g\nIP\nph(1\u2212 \u03b3). (15)\nThe cancellation which occurs for \u03b3 \u2248 1, happens, in this simple model, for all multiple-Pomeron\nexchanges. This phenomenon of \u201ccolour transparency\u201d for small-size configurations has been\nknown for a long time [21].\n3Partonic models of diffraction were originally introduced in Refs. [19, 20].\n4The state h should really be regarded as a third diffractive channel, but such a new state with a small\nproduction cross section gives a negligible contribution to \u2126.\n4\np p\nh\n+\np N*\nh\nFigure 1: The double-Pomeron exchange contribution to diffractive h production in the simple\ntwo-channel model of (13).\nIn order to specify the diffractive eigenstates |\u03c61\u3009 and |\u03c62\u3009 we shall consider two simple\nmodels (A and B). It is natural to identify the component with the smaller absorptive cross\nsection (that is |\u03c62\u3009) with the state which contains less partons and which has a large typical\nmomentum fraction x for each parton. From the QCD viewpoint, the small size component\nof the proton (where all the valence quarks are close together) has the smallest absorptive\ncross section, due to colour transparency. From the Regge viewpoint, the component with the\nlargest absorptive cross section corresponds to the eigenstate (|\u03c61\u3009) with a larger number of\npartons in the small x region. Thus from both viewpoints we expect the component with the\nsmaller cross section (smaller transverse size) to have a larger average x of each parton. At the\nmoment, it is impossible to be more specific, and so to make numerical estimates we consider\ntwo alternatives.\nFirst, in model A, we identify the valence quarks with |\u03c62\u3009 with the smaller absorption,\nand the gluons and sea quarks with |\u03c61\u3009. Of course the model is oversimplified. It is clear\nthat there is a part of the valence component with large size, while on the other hand the\ngluons and sea quarks contribute to the small size component. In general, one can write each\npartonic distribution fi(x,Q\n2) (i = valence, sea, glue) as the sum of a small (S) and large (L)\nsize component\nfi(x,Q\n2) = fSi (x,Q\n2) + fLi (x,Q\n2). (16)\nIn a model, where the probabilities of the S and L components in the proton are equal, as in\nSection 2, these components should satisfy the following sum rules,\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx fSV (x,Q\n2) =\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx fLV (x,Q\n2) =\n3\n2\n(17)\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx x\n\u2211\ni\nfSi (x,Q\n2) =\n\u222b 1\n0\ndx x\n\u2211\ni\nfLi (x,Q\n2) =\n1\n2\n, (18)\nwhich follow from the conservation of valence quark number and energy respectively.\nWe can therefore introduce an alternative model in terms of modified parton distributions\nfS,Li (x,Q\n2) = P S,Li (x,Q\n2) fi(x,Q\n2), (19)\n5\nwhere the projection operators have the simple forms\nPLi = (1\u2212 x)ni(Q\n2), P Si = 1 \u2212 PLi . (20)\nWe determine the values of ni in order to satisfy the sum rules of (17) and (18). We call this\nmodel B. It turns out that both models A and B give rather similar predictions. We study the\nimplications of the models in Section 5.\n4 Diffractive dijet production \u2014 a first look\nRecently CDF have measured diffractive dijet production for events with a leading antiproton\nat the Tevatron [17]. These observations, coupled with the diffractive measurements by H1\n[22] and ZEUS [23] at HERA, offer the opportunity to explore the diffractive framework in\nsome detail. The processes are shown schematically in Fig. 2, in the absence of rescattering\ncorrections. The lower parts of the diagrams, shown as Pomeron exchange, are to be understood\nas including multiple Pomeron contributions.\nM2\nj\nj\np\np\np\n\u03b2\nx1\nPI\n(a)\nTEVATRON HERA\n\u03b3\np\np\n\u03b2\nQ2\nPI\n(b)\nFigure 2: Schematic diagrams for diffractive dijet production at the Tevatron and for diffractive\ndeep inelastic scattering at HERA. The rescattering corrections are omitted in these diagrams.\nIf we ignore rescattering corrections, for the moment, then the cross section for diffractive\ndijet production of Fig. 2(a), integrated over t, may be written as\n\u03c3 =\n\u2211\ni,k\n\u222b\nFIP (\u03be) f\nIP\ni (\u03b2,E\n2\nT ) f\np\nk (x1, E\n2\nT ) \u03c3\u02c6 d\u03b2dx1d\u03be, (21)\nwhere \u03c3\u02c6 is the cross section to produce dijets from partons carrying longitudinal momentum\nfractions x1 and \u03b2 of the proton and Pomeron respectively. This would correspond to the\n6\nIngelman-Schlein conjecture [24]. Information on the diffractive structure functions f IPi (\u03b2,Q\n2)\nis obtained from measurements of the process of Fig. 2(b) at HERA [22, 23].

In Regge theory, the coupling\nsatisfies CIP = (g\nIP\npp)\n2\/16pi, such that the total pp\u00af cross section is given by\n\u03c3tot(pp\u00af) = (g\nIP\npp)\n2 (s\/s0)\n\u2206, (23)\nwhere s0 \u2261 1 GeV2 and \u2206 = \u03b1IP (0)\u2212 1.

The structure functions f IPi (\u03b2,Q\n2)\nare evaluated at Q2 = 75 GeV2, which approximately corresponds to the average E2T of the\nCDF data.\nThe prediction labelled by H1 is obtained from the H1 diffractive data, and corresponds\nto fit 2 of the H1 collaboration [22]. The curve labelled by ZEUS(Pom) corresponds to the\nprediction obtained from ZEUS data in Ref. [23]6. It does not include the contribution of\nsecondary Reggeons. Note that the ZEUS data are in the region of very small \u03be and thus are\npractically insensitive to these contributions. The curve labelled ZEUS\u2032 includes the secondary\nReggeon contribution as determined by H1 collaboration7. A comparison of the two latter\ncurves shows that the non-Pomeron \u201cbackground\u201d is rather important in the \u03be region covered\nby CDF (about 50% of the total contribution). These three predictions are representative of\n5Here we define the Pomeron flux slightly differently to Ref. [17] by including CIP in (22).\n6Note that the curve in Fig. 3 for the ZEUS structure function differs from that calculated in [25].\n7This procedure may not be completely consistent as values of the Pomeron intercept are different in the\nanalyses of the H1 and ZEUS data (see Refs. [22, 23]). This can lead to a modification of the secondary Reggeon\ncontribution for the ZEUS parametrization.\n7\nthose obtained from the various sets of diffractive structure functions that are available [26].\nThey illustrate the large uncertainties in the predictions of the shape of F\u02dcDjj at large \u03b2, and in the\noverall normalisation. On the other hand, the shape predicted for \u03b2 <\u223c 0.15 is well determined\nto be \u03b2\u2212\u03b4 with \u03b4 = 0.4\u2212 0.5, and differs markedly from the measured \u03b4 \u2243 1 behaviour of the\nCDF data.\n\u03b2\nFjj(\u03b2)\nH1\nZEUS(Pom) ZEUS\nI\nII \/\nD\nFigure 3: A comparison of the measured CDF dijet diffractive distribution as a function of\n\u03b2, with different predictions obtained from analyses of HERA diffractive data assuming Regge\nfactorization and that rescattering corrections are neglected. The shaded region on the CDF\ndata shows the band of uncertainty shown in Ref. [17].\nThe diffractive gluon distribution is the main contributor to the predictions of F\u02dcDjj . Although\nthe diffractive quark distributions are well-measured at HERA (since the photon couples directly\nto the quark), the gluon distribution is determined from the detailed Q2 behaviour of the\nexperimental data using QCD evolution. Moreover, the uncertainties in the diffractive structure\nfunctions f IPi (\u03b2,Q\n2) are amplified by sizeable differences between H1 and ZEUS diffractive\n8\ndata in certain \u03b2,Q2 domains. These uncertainties mainly affect the gluon distribution and are\nresponsible for the ambiguity in the predictions for the shape of F\u02dcDjj at large \u03b2, and in the overall\nnormalisation. All the predictions give similar shapes for \u03b2 <\u223c 0.15, because they are determined\nmainly by the QCD evolution. We will therefore study this evident difference between the CDF\nand HERA shape of F\u02dcD at small \u03b2, as well as the difference in overall normalisation8, which\nare clearly not reproduced in the naive model based on Fig. 2.\nAlthough we see from the curves shown in Fig. 3 that, at present, there are large uncer-\ntainties in the Pomeron structure function measured at HERA, curves I and II should provide\na realistic illustration of the range of acceptable values, for the reasons given above. These\ntwo alternative curves are used in the analysis of the CDF data presented below. The curve\nI corresponds to the function 4.6(1 \u2212 \u03b2)1.1\u03b2\u22120.45, and is very close to the parametrization of\nCapella et al. [28] (with secondary reggeons taken from [22]), while the curve II corresponds\nto the parametrization 2.5(1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03b2\u22120.58, which we choose to account for possible variations\ndue to the uncertainty in the secondary Reggeon contribution. Recall both parametrizations\ncorresponding to Q2 = 75 GeV2.\nThe discrepancies between the Tevatron and HERA data were discussed in [29], where it\nwas emphasized that the survival probability of the gap is (i) small, and (ii) dependent on\nthe value of \u03b2. Physical arguments were presented which qualitatively reproduce the scale of\nnormalisation and some trends in the \u03b2 dependence at large \u03b2. Note that the effects causing the\nobserved \u03b2-dependence of the diffractive structure function considered in [29] and in this paper\nconcern different regions in \u03b2 and are of different dynamical origin. While the fall-off at \u03b2 \u2192 1\nis attributed in [29] dominantly to Sudakov suppression effects, in this paper the variation of\nthe shape of the \u03b2-distribution is explained mainly by the competition between the different\nparton configurations. In this way, we present below a two-channel model prediction, based on\n[9], which turns out to be in surprising agreement with both the normalisation difference and\nin the shape of the distributions at low \u03b2.\n5 Diffractive dijet production including rescattering\neffects\nTo explain the main features of the CDF diffractive dijet data it is sufficient to consider the two-\ncomponent diffractive models introduced in Section 3. In model A we assume that the sea quarks\nand gluons mainly occur in large-size configurations of the incident proton, while the valence\nquarks occupy predominantly small-size configurations. This is, of course, an oversimplification\nof the real situation, but we find even this simple physical model is able to account for the\nbehaviour of the data.\n8Note that earlier CDF results [27] on diffractive W boson, dijet, b-quark and J\/\u03c8 production rates, using\nforward rapidity gap tagging, have already provided evidence against approaches which do not account for\nrescattering effects.\n9\nThe two-channel generalisation of (1) gives, using model9 A of Section 3, the survival prob-\nability of the gaps10\n|S|2 =\n\u222b\nd2b\n(\n|Mv|2 e\u2212\u2126v(s,b) + |Msea|2 e\u2212\u2126sea(s,b)\n)\n\u222b\nd2b (|Mv|2 + |Msea|2) , (25)\nwhereMv,sea are the probability amplitudes (in impact parameter space) of the hard diffractive\nprocess corresponding to the valence quark and to the sea quarks and gluons respectively. The\nfunctions \u2126i can be parametrized in the form\n11\n\u2126i = Ki\n(gIPpp)\n2 (s\/s0)\n\u2206\n4piB\ne\u2212b\n2\/4B, (26)\nwith i = v, sea, and where the slope of the Pomeron amplitude is\nB = 1\n2\nB0 + \u03b1\n\u2032 ln(s\/s0), (27)\nwith s0 = 1 GeV\n2. We take Kv = 1\u2212 \u03b3 and Ksea = 1 + \u03b3, consistent with the simple physical\nmodel introduced above. The values of the other parameters were determined in a two-channel\nglobal description of the total, differential elastic and soft diffraction cross sections [9], in which\nthe parameter \u03b3 was fixed to be 0.4.\nFirst we indicate why the soft rescattering effects (\u2126i 6= 0) of the model based on (25) modify\nthe \u03b2 distribution of the dijet process in a characteristic way. Note that the CDF measurements\ncover a narrow \u03be interval, 0.035 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 0.095, and hence that the invariant mass squared of the\ndiffractively produced state, M2 = \u03bes, remains close to the average value 2\u00d7 105 GeV2. Also\nthe mass squared of the produced dijet system,\nM2jj = x1\u03b2M\n2, (28)\nsee Fig. 2, does not change much compared to its average value of about 1\u00d7103 GeV2 calculated\nfor the CDF kinematical range. Thus x1\u03b2 \u2243 0.005 and so for \u03b2 >\u223c 0.25 we have x1 <\u223c 0.02,\nwhereas for \u03b2 \u223c 0.025 we have x1 \u223c 0.2. Therefore for large \u03b2 (small x1) sea quarks and gluons\nwill give the dominant contribution, while for small \u03b2 the valence quarks play an important\nrole. Hence the survival probability should increase as x1 increases and \u03b2 decreases.\n9In model B the subscripts \u2018v\u2019 and \u2018sea\u2019 correspond to the components with the smaller and larger absorption\ncross sections respectively.\n10In fact in the calculations a more accurate formula is used which takes into account the inelastic rescatterings\nof both of the colliding protons, see Appendix B of Ref. [9].\n11We show formula (26) in order to again simplify the discussion. In this simplified form the values of the\nparameters would be about (gIPpp)\n2 = 25 mb, B0 = 8 GeV\n\u22122, \u2206 = 0.1 and \u03b1\u2032 = 0.15 GeV\u22122. However, in\npractice we use the more realistic \u2126i(i = v, sea) that were determined in the global description of total, elastic\nand soft diffractive data in the ISR to Tevatron energy range [9]. In addition the pion-loop contribution in the\nPomeron was included (that is the nearest t-channel singularity), as well as the contribution coming from large\nmass single- and double-diffractive dissociation. These refinements are not crucial for the effects that we discuss\nhere.\n10\nPS \/ PLB\nA quark \/ gluon\nFjj(\u03b2)\n\u03b2\nD\nI\nII\nI\nII(Small \/ Large \u03c3abs)\nFigure 4: The predictions for diffractive dijet production at the Tevatron, obtained from two\nalternative sets of \u2018HERA\u2019 diffractive parton distributions I and II (of Fig. 3), compared with\nthe CDF data [17]. The upper two curves correspond to the neglect of rescattering corrections,\nwhereas the lower four curves show the effect of including these corrections using model A (con-\ntinuous curves) and model B (dashed curves) for the diffractive eigenstates (|\u03c6i\u3009 of Sections 2\nand 3).\nThe calculation of the diffraction dijet rate, incorporating the rescattering effects of (25),\nconfirms these expectations, as shown by the lower pair of continuous curves (I and II) in\nFig. 4. These curves are parameter-free predictions of the diffractive dijet rate based on the\ntwo-channel eikonal model of Ref. [9] and on the diffractive distributions obtained from HERA\ndata. The two models (A and B of Section 3) for the diffractive eigenstates (|\u03c61\u3009 and |\u03c62\u3009)\ngive similar predictions to each other, as shown respectively by the continuous and dashed\ncurves in the lower part of Fig. 3. We see that the pair of curves II satisfactorily reproduce\nthe normalisation and the experimentally observed shape of the \u03b2 distribution. Curves I also\n11\ngive a satisfactory description at low \u03b2; the difference at larger \u03b2 just reflects the uncertainty\nin the \u2018HERA\u2019 diffractive distributions. Recall that the predicted shapes show an anomalously\nstrong increase12, 1\/\u03b2\u03b4 with \u03b4 \u2248 0.8 \u2212 0.9, for small \u03b2, as compared with the \u03b4 \u2248 0.4 \u2212 0.5\nbehaviour given by the partonic distributions of the Pomeron. A possible change of ET (jet),\ndue to a variation \u2206ET of the transverse energy of the underlying event with \u03b2, was taken into\naccount in our calculations. We took \u2206ET = C(1 \u2212 \u03b2)2 with C = 0.76 GeV chosen so as to\nsatisfy the observed \u3008\u2206ET \u3009 = 0.54 GeV [17]. The origin of such \u03b2-behaviour can be traced\nto the fragmentation of the gluon jet. It leads to a small \u223c 10% decrease of the theoretical\npredictions for \u03b2 >\u223c 0.2.\nThe overall normalisation of the prediction for the CDF dijet data, which is reproduced\nby the average value of the survival probability (25), is sensitive to the impact parameter dis-\ntributions, Mi(s, b), of the hard diffractive process. Such a comparison can therefore provide\ninformation on these distributions which, in turn, reveal the spatial structure of the hard pro-\ncess. Our curves are obtained under the same assumptions for the single diffractive production\nof a massive hadronic state as were used in Ref. [9]. That is, as for the minimum bias single\ndiffractive process, but without the term \u03b1\u2032 ln(M2\/s0), since \u03b1\n\u2032 \u2192 0 in (LO) DGLAP evolution\nto the scale \u00b52 \u223c 75 GeV2 of the hard subprocess.\nOur calculation of diffractive dijet production illustrates a crucial ingredient necessary in\nthe description of rapidity gap processes. Namely that the survival probability of a gap can\ndepend on x1 of the partons in the proton (see Fig. 2(a)). This leads to many experimental\nconsequences for processes with rapidity gaps. For instance, if diffractive dijet production were\nmeasured at higher (LHC) energies with the same jet threshold (EjT ), then the values of x1 of\nthe partons from the proton will be much smaller throughout the same interval of \u03b2. Thus the\nvariation of |S|2 with \u03b2 will disappear, and the shape of the \u03b2 distribution in this interval will\nbe close to that measured at HERA. The effect that is observed at the Tevatron is predicted\nto occur at the LHC, but at much smaller values of \u03b2, see (28).\n5.1 Other \u03b2 dependent effects\nWe also estimated other possible mechanisms that may influence the predictions of the dijet\n\u03b2 distribution shown in Fig. 4. We discuss these mechanisms in turn below. None of them\nis expected to be significant, and anyway influences mainly the region of \u03b2 \u223c 1. Most of the\neffects tend to make the \u03b2 distributions steeper and to improve the agreement with experi-\nment. However we have not included them in our predictions so as not to obscure the main\nphenomenon discussed in our paper.\n(a) The mechanism shown by the diagram of Fig. 5(a) describes the situation where the\nPomeron couples to the \u2018ladder\u2019 in the upper part of the diagram, rather than to the\n12This increase is still somewhat weaker than that seen in the data (\u03b4 \u2248 1) [17]. However the CDF data\ninclude up to 4 jets, while the theoretical predictions are given for 2 jet production. If the data are restricted\nto two jet production then the increase is less steep (and given by the lower part of the shaded band) [17], and,\nin fact, in agreement with our \u03b2 dependence.\n12\npIP\np\ng\ng\nIP\nj\nj\np\n(a)\np p\ny1\nPI\ny2\ng\ng\nj\nj\nj\nj\ng\ng\np p\n(b)\nFigure 5: (a) Another possible contribution relevant to the calculation of the survival prob-\nability of the rapidity gap in diffractive dijet production, where the \u2018rescattering\u2019 Pomeron\ncouples to the upper \u2018ladder\u2019, rather than to the incoming proton. (b) The contribution to\nthe diffractive dijet cross section coming from the interference of diagram (a) with the Born\ndiagram of Fig. 2(a).\nproton as we have considered so far. It may influence the value of the survival probability\nat very small x1. The interference of Fig. 5(a) with the Born diagram of Fig. 2(a) leads\nto a contribution to the cross section shown in Fig. 5(b). It contributes when the rapidity\nintervals yi (shown in Fig. 5(b)) are large; note that y1+y2 = ln 1\/x1. This effect is small\nat the Tevatron because of the lack of phase space (y1 + y2 <\u223c 5), but it should be taken\ninto account at the LHC.\n(b) Another possible non-factorizable contribution is where a soft gluon from the Pomeron\ncouples to the upper partons or spectator quarks of the proton [30, 29]. Their dominant\ncontribution may be summed and absorbed in the reggeization of the gluon, that is BFKL\neffects in parton evolution. The remaining contribution is strongly suppressed since, when\nthe soft t-channel gluon crosses an s-channel parton, it changes the colour structure of\nthe corresponding splitting kernel. For the singlet (gluon ladder) NC is replaced by NC\/2,\nwhereas for the non-singlet (quark ladder) CF = (N\n2\nC \u2212 1)\/2NC is replaced by \u22121\/2NC .\nUsing the double log approximation we estimate this effect increases the prediction by\nless than 10% for small \u03b2, and less than 4% for \u03b2 > 0.3.\n13\n(c) For large \u03b2 there is an additional Sudakov-like suppression due to QCD radiation from\nhigh ET jets [29]. Again the dominant contribution is already included in the effective\nstructure of the Pomeron measured in DIS at HERA. However conventional DGLAP\nevolution does not account for double logs of the type (\u03b1S\/4pi) ln\n2(1\u2212 \u03b2), which sum up\nto exp(\u2212(\u03b1S\/4pi)C ln2(1\u2212\u03b2)). The effect may be important when \u03b2 \u2192 1, but is negligible\nin the \u03b2 < 0.5 domain of present interest.\n(d) Hadronization may change the longitudinal momentum of the high ET jet [34]. The\ngeneral effect is to shift the hadronic jet towards the centre-of-mass of the hadronic state,\nM2 in Fig. 2(a), and to reduce the effective value of \u03b2. A conservative estimate is that\nthe prediction for F\u02dcDjj is changed by less than 10% for \u03b2 < 0.3, although it works in the\ndesired direction to steepen the \u03b2 dependence.\n(e) The predictions depend on the spatial size of the triple-Pomeron vertex. The correspond-\ning slope bp is small, but not well known. We use the same slope bp = 1 GeV\n\u22122 as in\n[9], but bp = 0 or 2 GeV\n\u22122 are not excluded. Moreover we may expect bp to be smaller\nfor larger \u03b2 \u2192 1, when the Pomeron couples just to the hard sub-process. If we take\nbp = (1\u2212 \u03b2) GeV\u22122 then the prediction is unchanged in the small \u03b2 region, although it\ndecreases by about 10% at \u03b2 = 1\/3. The sensitivity to the radius of the triple-Pomeron\nvertex indicates the importance of the experimental study of diffractive dissociation pro-\ncesses to better determine bp.\n6 Predictions for other hard diffractive processes\nThe observation that the suppression factors can depend on the values of the momentum\nfractions xi, carried by the partons in the colliding hadrons, has implications for hard diffractive-\nlike processes in general. For example, diffractiveW -production at the Tevatron [31] is mediated\ndominantly by valence quarks in the proton, and hence the survival probability for such a process\nis comparatively large, S2 \u2243 0.2 \u2212 0.3. On the other hand, for diffractive processes mediated\nby the gluonic components of the colliding hadrons (such as bb\u00af, J\/\u03c8, \u03c8\u2032 or \u03a5 production) the\nsurvival probabilities should be smaller S2 \u2243 0.06\u2212 0.1.\nAn interesting application is to the production of two high pT jets (p1T \u2243 \u2212p2T ) separated\nby a large rapidity gap, as measured by both the D0 [32] and CDF [33] collaborations at the\nTevatron at two energies,\n\u221a\ns = 630 and 1800 GeV. Both the quark and gluon components of\nthe proton contribute in this case. However, in our approach the suppression factor depends\nstrongly on the type of parton (model A) or on the x value of the parton (model B). For a\nfixed energy\n\u221a\ns, the ratio of the quark to the gluon component increases as ET of the jets\nincreases, and as the rapidity interval \u2206\u03b7 between the jets increases. The relative importance\nof the quark component also increases as the energy\n\u221a\ns decreases, simply due to kinematics.\nThese features of the simple two-channel model give effects which move in the right direction to\n14\nexplain outstanding puzzles in the interpretation of the D0 and CDF data for jets separated by\na rapidity gap [32, 33]. In particular, they help to understand the\n\u221a\ns, ET and \u2206\u03b7 dependences\nof the colour-singlet (rapidity gap) fraction measured at the Tevatron [32, 33]. Our model gives\na natural explanation of the observation by the D0 collaboration, that the suppression factor\ndepends mainly on the x of the partons and increases strongly with x, see Fig. 4(d) of [32].\nAll of the effects discussed above can be studied in hard diffractive processes in p-nucleus\ncollisions at RHIC and LHC. Investigation of the A-dependence can provide new information on\nthe strength of shadowing effects. Indeed for weak shadowing, the cross sections for coherent\ndiffraction dissociation of a proton on nuclei behave as \u223c A4\/3, while incoherent diffraction\ncross sections behave as \u223c A. In the opposite limit of very strong shadowing both cross\nsections have much weaker dependence on A, of the form \u223c A1\/3. Thus there is a strong change\nin A-dependence of diffractive production on nuclei depending on the strength of the shadowing\neffects.\nWe also note that the survival probability for central Higgs production by WW fusion, with\nlarge rapidity gaps on either side, is enhanced in the two-channel model in comparison with\nprevious estimates [9, 11], which also included allowance for the survival probability. Thus\nin Ref. [9] for WW \u2192 H process at the LHC S2 was found to be 0.15, while the approach\nof this paper gives S2 = 0.24. This is an important process because it appears that large qT\nHiggs configurations can be chosen such as to identify the Higgs over the possible background\nprocesses at the LHC [36, 35]. The same survival probability is applicable to central Z boson\nproduction with a rapidity gap on either side, originating from t-channel gauge boson exchange.\nTherefore Z production at the LHC can be used to directly measure the survival probability\nof rapidity gaps relevant to Higgs production by WW fusion [3].\n7 Conclusions\nFor hard processes with large rapidity gaps, we have demonstrated that the survival probability\nof the gaps has a much richer structure than is given by the simple one-channel eikonal approx-\nimation of (1). We introduced two-channel eikonal models in which either the valence quark\nand the sea quark (+ gluon) components of the proton have substantially different total cross\nsections of absorption \u03c3toti (s), which we called model A, or alternatively, model B, in which the\nsmall and large size diffractive components are specified according to sum rules (17) and (18).\nThe two models give similar results, and predict that the survival probability of the rapidity\ngap has a characteristic dependence on the kinematics of the process. Data for diffractive dijet\nproduction at the Tevatron [17] enabled this kinematic dependence to be checked. Taking the\nparameters of the two-channel models which were previously constrained in a global description\n[9] of total, elastic and soft diffraction data, we calculated the \u03b2 distribution of diffractive dijet\nproduction. The results are shown by the lower four curves in Fig. 4. We see that there is gen-\neral agreement between the predictions and the CDF measurements [17], both in normalisation\n15\nand shape. In fact, the use of Pomeron structure function II quantitatively reproduces the CDF\ndata [17]. We emphasize that if the Pomeron structure function were known unambiguously\nthen we would have an essentially unique prediction for the Tevatron data, demonstrated by\nthe small difference between the predictions of models A and B.\nUnfortunately, the agreement between the CDF diffractive dijet data and our calculations\ncan be taken as a strong support for the low value of the survival probability S2, which leads to\nthe rather pessimistic expectations for the missing-mass Higgs search at the Tevatron [6, 37].\nAs precise data for other hard processes with rapidity gaps become available, it will be\npossible to refine the model and to identify the parton content of the diffractive eigenchannels.\nWe already showed that the simple two-channel model gave rescattering corrections which\nmoved in the right direction to resolve discrepancies between the predictions and the data for\nprocesses which have so far been measured. In this way, as precise data become available, it\nwill be possible to perform a quantitative study to (i) determine the partonic content of the\nPomeron, (ii) check the QCD evolution of the Pomeron structure functions, (iii) confirm the\nuniversality of the partonic decomposition, (iv) determine \u03c3toti (s) for the different diffractive\neigenchannels, and (v) measure the impact parameter distributions of the \u2018Born\u2019 amplitudes of\nthe hard processes with rapidity gaps.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Dino Goulianos and Ken-ichi Hatakeyama for useful discussions.
