Forests are\nalso affected directly by the impact of increased CO2 levels and temperatures on\necosystem processes, and indirectly by human responses seeking to mitigate the net\nemissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) or adapting to new climates. This paper\nassesses the significance of these different aspects in the context of poverty\nreduction. It provides a brief assessment of the global effect of deforestation on net\nglobal GHG emissions; assesses the positive and negative direct effects of climate\nchange on forest productivity, forest disturbance, carbon sequestration, water and\nair quality, biodiversity and cultural services; and discusses the indirect effects on\nforestry of human responses to minimize net GHG emissions through new markets,\nother land use change and global, national and local initiatives.\nKeywords: forests; climate change; land use change; ecosystem services; biomass;\ncarbon\nPaul J.

In the\ncontext of the United Nations Millennium Development\nGoal of halving extreme poverty by 2015, it is estimated\nthat forest resources contribute directly to the livelihoods\nof 90% of the 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty \u2013\nthat is, living on less than US$1 per day (World Bank,\n2004). Forest products are vital to the poor. Wood fuel, for\nexample, is the primary energy source for heating and\ncooking for some 2.6 billion people (Sampson et al, 2005).\nWhen adequate wood fuel is unavailable, the consump-\ntion of cooked food can decline, with adverse effects on\nhealth and nutrition (Sampson et al, 2005).\nSo how will climate change impact on forests and on\nthe poor who depend upon them? We first examine the\ncontribution of deforestation to global greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions and then how increased carbon dioxide\nconcentration and climate change impact on forest\nprocesses, goods and services. Finally, we explore how\nsociety may respond to the predicted and actual effects of\nclimate change, such as by creating new markets, new\nland use, new global agreements, plus national and local\ninitiatives to promote adaptive forest management.\nDeforestation and greenhouse gas emissions\nGlobally, forests occupy 3,900 million ha, or about 30% of\nthe world\u2019s land area (Table 1). It is estimated that about\n1,340 million ha (34%) of this is primary forest.

Trees and other plants take up atmospheric\ncarbon dioxide through photosynthesis and store\nconsiderable amounts of carbon as woody tissue, leaves\nand roots. Because forest soils are typically uncultivated,\nsubstantial carbon reserves also accumulate from leaf\nlitter and decayed roots. Reducing deforestation and\nincreasing afforestation therefore constitute a key\nmechanism for constraining atmospheric GHG emissions.\nAlthough globally the annual net loss of the forest area\nhas decreased in recent years (Table 2), the net loss was\nstill about 7.3 million ha per year in 2000 (Table 1). This\nvalue was derived from a gross loss of 13 million ha of\nestablished forests and a gross gain of 5.7 million ha of\nnew forests. For example, in Asia (Table 2), there are high\nrates of deforestation in Indonesia (South and South-east\nAsia), but high rates of afforestation in China (in East\nAsia; see Table 3). More recent figures, to be published by\nFAO in December 2010, suggest that the net annual loss in\nforest area between 2000 and 2010 was 5.2 million hectares\n(FAO, 2010).\nOne global annual estimate of the level of GHG\nemissions attributed to net deforestation (including losses\nfrom peat) is 8,530 Mt CO2 equivalent (Barker et al, 2007).\nAssuming a global emission of 49,000 Mt CO2 equivalent\n(IPCC, 2007b), this approximates to 17.4%. However, the\nuncertainty associated with this value is the \u2018largest in the\nglobal carbon budget\u2019 (IPCC, 2007a). For example, the\nIPCC (2007a) estimated an annual net GHG emission due\nto land use change (primarily conversion from forestry) of\n5,800 Mt CO2 equivalent in the 1990s. In some countries,\nhowever, the proportion of GHG emissions attributed to\ndeforestation is disproportionately large \u2013 land use\nchange in Indonesia and Brazil, for example, is estimated\nto be responsible for 84% and 59% respectively of the\nnational emissions (Figure 1). However, the overall effect\nof deforestation on climate change is also complicated by\nchanges in albedo (surface reflectivity) and heat fluxes.\nFor example, a dark forested landscape generally reflects\nonly 10\u201320% of solar radiation, compared with 40\u201350% for\ngrassland and croplands (Eliasch Review, 2008). This\ncould reduce the net effect of changes in forest cover on\ntemperatures.\nDirect impacts of climate change on forests\nIncreased temperature and carbon dioxide levels, as well\nas the human response to them, affect numerous forest\nprocesses that determine the capacity of forests to provide\nthe goods and services that society values. Key processes\ninclude timber and wood-fuel production, carbon\nsequestration, water and air quality regulation and the\nmaintenance of biodiversity and cultural services.\nForest productivity\nExperiments suggest that the increasing concentrations of\nCO2 from the current level of about 380 ppm to about\n550 ppm will increase the above-ground growth rate of\nyoung trees by about 30% (Easterling et al, 2007), with\n265Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 39, No 4\nClimate change causes, risks and opportunities in forestry\nFigure 1. Total GHG emissions in 2000 for top 11 countries (or\ncountry groupings), highlighting the negative effects of land use\nchange in Indonesia, Brazil and Malaysia, and the positive effects\nin the USA, EU27, China and India.\nSource: WRI, 2009.\nlower gains shown by mature trees. At present, the global\nannual wood harvest is about 3 billion m3, about 0.7% of\nthe living forest stock (FAO, 2006), and between 40 and\n55% of this is used as fuel (Sampson et al, 2005). In the\nboreal regions, higher CO2 levels, combined with higher\ntemperatures, are likely to result in a net increase in global\nwood supply (Easterling et al, 2007). However, in other\nregions, such gains will not be achieved as temperature,\nwater or nitrogen become limiting. For example, droughts\nare predicted to become more frequent and intense in the\nsubtropical and Mediterranean-type forests in the western\nUSA, northern China, southern Europe and Australia.\nForest disturbance\nForests are perennial systems that are vulnerable to pests,\ndiseases, fire and other disturbances such as wind, snow,\nice and floods (Dale et al, 2001). About 100 million ha of\nforests are damaged each year \u2013 by pests (37 million ha),\ndiseases (31 million ha), fire (25 million ha) and other\ndisturbance (8 million ha) (FAO, 2006). Under a warmer\nclimate, the ranges of many forest pests are expected to\nexpand and the frequency and intensity of outbreaks are\nexpected to increase (Galik and Jackson, 2009). Higher\ntemperatures in both boreal and tropical regions are\npredicted to increase fire frequency (Nabuurs et al, 2007).\nHowever, the effects can be complex. Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al (2009)\nreport that forest fires in southern Africa decreased as\nrainfall decreased (because of less grass fuel) and human\npopulation increased. Higher sea surface temperatures\nhave been linked with greater hurricane activity.\nHurricane Katrina in 2005 converted 50\u2013140% of the\naverage annual US forest carbon storage rate into wind-\nblown or dead biomass (Chambers et al, 2007). By\ncontrast, increased temperatures may reduce the\nfrequency of ice storms, which are the primary source of\ntree mortality in some areas (Galik and Jackson, 2009). In\nother cases, severe disturbances can cause amplifying\nfeedback loops, whereby deforestation leads to increased\ndroughts, which result in further deforestation (Laurance\nand Williamson, 2001).\nCarbon sequestration\nGrowing forests absorb more CO2 than they emit and\nhence they can reduce annual net global GHG emissions.\nThe IPCC (2007a) estimated that during the 1990s, exclud-\ning the negative effects of land use change, land\n(including agriculture and forestry) acted as a net sink of\nabout 9,500 Mt CO2 per year. Although the standard\ndeviation on this value is large (\u00b1 6,200 Mt CO2 per year),\nthe mean value is equivalent to about 20% of the warming\npotential of gross global GHG emissions in 2004 (IPCC,\n2007b). Whilst predicted increases in carbon dioxide\nconcentration and temperature will lead to greater carbon\nsequestration where low temperatures are limiting,\nincreased temperatures will also increase CO2 losses from\nsoil respiration (Rustad et al, 2001), and some forests may\nbecome net emitters rather than absorbers of CO2 (Scholze\net al, 2006).\nWater and air quality\nForests regulate 57% of total water run-off globally\n(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) and may\nbecome increasingly important as increased temperatures\nusually lead to more intense rainfall events. Coastal\nmangroves are also important nurseries for fish species\nand for protecting coastal areas from flood and storm\nsurges. The projected increase in forest fires will have\nnegative effects on air quality and human health. Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4\net al (2009) cite World Health Organization data stating\nthat 200 million people were affected by the 1997\u201398 forest\nfires in East Kalimantan in Indonesia.\nBiodiversity\nIt is estimated that at least 80% of terrestrial biodiversity\nis found in the world\u2019s forests (World Bank, 2004).\nThomas et al (2004) estimated that, from the current total,\nspecies extinctions from climate change in forested\nsystems could range from about 1% in boreal forests and\n4% in tropical forests, to 24% in temperate deciduous\nforests. The areas at greatest risk are those where current\nforest ranges are separated from potential future ranges.\nRare montane habitats and Australian tropical forest are\nexamples of this (Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al, 2009).\nCultural services\nIn developed countries such as the UK, the recreational\nand landscape value of forests can be greater than their\nvalue for wood production (Willis et al, 2003; CogentSi\nand PACEC, 2004). Tourism can also be dependent on\nforest habitats in less developed countries. However, few\nstudies have investigated the likely effect of climate\nchange on the provision of such services.\nPeople\u2019s responses to climate change\nWhilst adjustments within natural systems will only occur\nin response to actual physical changes, changes in\nmanaged systems can also result from responses to\npredicted effects. The greatest adverse effect of climate\nchange on forests will tend to occur in tropical and\nsubtropical areas where the greatest poverty already\nexists. Although developed countries will generally be\nless directly affected, they remain responsible for the\nlargest amount of GHG emissions and therefore have a\nmoral obligation to reduce emissions and to help those in\npoverty to adapt to the negative effects.

Whilst some of these responses\naim to moderate harm, there are also beneficial\nopportunities.\nNew markets\nA major current thrust of society\u2019s response to reduce CO2\nconcentrations has been the promotion of renewable fuels\nbased on biomass. There has also been a focus on\nreducing the carbon emissions associated with building\nconstruction to favour the use of timber rather than, say,\nconcrete. Some of these market signals can unfortunately\nboth create incentives for people to invest in establishing\nand managing forests and to clear existing forests for\nenterprises such as palm oil plantations. Whilst palm oil is\na competitively priced renewable fuel, the loss of soil\ncarbon in the process can create fuel with a larger carbon\nfootprint than the fossil fuel it replaces. Sampson et al\n(2005) also report that unregulated and increased use of\nwood fuel may have significant health effects, as it is\nestimated that 1.6 million deaths per year are attributable\nto indoor smoke pollution. Such examples show that\ngovernments must ensure that market signals and\nregulation do not create perverse outcomes.\nChanges in non-forest land use\nIn addition to growing bio-energy crops to reduce fossil\nfuel consumption, people are likely to adapt their land\nuse in response to the different CO2 levels, temperatures\nand water availability in future climates. In Africa, crop\nyields are likely to fall as a result of warmer\ntemperatures and increased frequency of droughts\n(IPCC, 2007a). To meet future demand for food, this may\nwell mean that agricultural production in affected\ncountries can only be maintained through increasing the\ncultivated area. While some of this may come from\nmarginal land, it is also likely to increase pressure to clear\nforests for agriculture.\nEmerging global agreements\nRedressing deforestation and using forests to deliver a\nwide range of goods and services (including carbon\nsequestration) is the subject of a wide range of global\ninitiatives. For example, the \u2018Global Partnership on Forest\nLandscape Restoration\u2019 is a network that seeks to unite\ngovernments, organizations and communities with the\ncommon global goal of promoting an increase in\nsustainable forests.\nIn order to mitigate the effects of climate change, the\nEliasch Review (2008) recommends that a cap-and-trade\nsystem is the most effective, efficient and equitable\nmethod of achieving long-term reductions in GHG\nemissions from the forest sector. Although the Kyoto\nProtocol (ending in 2012) allowed afforestation and\nreforestation to contribute to national targets, reducing\nemissions from deforestation and forest degradation\n(REDD) were not eligible, for a variety of reasons. It is\nanticipated that the global post-2012 climate regime will\ninclude mechanisms for allowing the GHG emissions from\nreductions in deforestation and degradation to contribute\nto national targets (Table 4). This would also support\nthose seeking a global agreement to reduce tropical\nTable 4. Possible scope of creditable activities related to forests in\na post-2012 climate regime.\nChanges in: Reduced negative Enhanced positive\nchange change\nForest area (ha) Avoided deforestation Afforestation and\nreforestation (A\/R)\nCarbon density Avoided degradation Forest restoration\n(carbon\/ha) and rehabilitation\n(carbon stock\nenhancement)\nSource: after Angelsen, 2008.\ndeforestation by at least 50% by 2020 and to halt global\nforest cover loss by 2030 at the latest (DECC, 2009).\nHowever, there are several challenges that need to be\naddressed for the development of an agreeable global\nprotocol. Climate change will cause the forest area in\nsome regions to increase, whilst it will decline in others. A\nworkable system will need to have politically acceptable\ntargets related to baseline data (Myers, 2007). It will also\nbe necessary to ensure that changes in forest area, and\nperhaps carbon storage per area, can be monitored,\nreported and verified (MRV). Moreover, there should be\nsafeguards to ensure that the changes are additional and\ndo not lead to deforestation elsewhere (leakage) or in the\nfuture (permanence). In Vietnam, research has shown that\nsome of the increase in forested area was offset by an\nincrease in timber imports, some of which were illegal\n(Meyfroidt and Lambin, 2010). In the medium to long\nterm, carbon markets may well generate significant\nfinance, but in the short term, international investment\nwill be needed to develop the governance and\nmechanisms to administer the MRV systems. The annual\nfinance needed to halve deforestation has been estimated\nat US$17\u201333 billion (Eliasch Review, 2008).\nFor the development sector, a key aspect of any climate\nchange agreement is that the benefits of REDD are\ndistributed equitably, ideally delivering co-benefits in\nterms of poverty reduction and human rights protection,\nor at the very least not disadvantaging already vulnerable\npeople. Such an agreement is referred to as REDD+, in\nwhich reduced deforestation and degradation are\nintegrated with sustainable forest management and\nconservation. There are also arguments that future\nagreements need to take a whole-landscape approach and\ncomprehensively cover agriculture, forestry and other\nland uses (AFOLU) to avoid systematic double counting\nand leakage to other sectors.\nNational initiatives and land tenure\nAlthough progress will be greatest where international\nand national initiatives are aligned, national and regional\ngovernments still have the right and responsibility to\ndevelop their own programmes to reduce the effect of\nforest management on GHG emissions and to adapt to the\neffects of climate change. It is estimated that about 80% of\nthe world\u2019s forests are publicly owned (FAO, 2010), and\nonly 6% of the forests in developing countries are covered\nby a formal, nationally approved management plan that\nexceeds five years (Nabuurs et al, 2007). Although national\n267Outlook on AGRICULTURE Vol 39, No 4\nClimate change causes, risks and opportunities in forestry\npolicies need to appreciate the innate conservatism of the\nforest sector in general, appropriate policies based on\nregulation, incentives and guidance can encourage\nadaptation. In many cases, this will require a more\nsocially inclusive form of forest governance than has\ncustomarily been the case (Read et al, 2009). Moreover, in\nmany countries, clarifying and securing land tenure rights\nfor forest land alongside the development of national\nforest management plans is seen as essential for\nsustainable forest management (Eliasch Review, 2008;\nNabuurs et al, 2007).\nAdaptive forest management\nSustainable forest management recognizes that\nmanagement evolves to ensure that forests provide an\nappropriate mix of ecosystem services. This may be\nwithin a single forest, or different forests areas may have\nspecific roles. Globally, the area of forests designated for\nbiodiversity conservation is increasing (Table 3). The area\nof plantation forests is also increasing, and although only\ncomprising 3.8% of global forest cover in 2005, they\nsupply about 35% of the global roundwood harvest (FAO,\n2006). Sohngen et al (2001) suggest that by 2050, 75% of\nindustrial wood will be harvested from plantations. Other\nforests may be managed principally to control soil erosion\nor water flows.\nClimate change will undoubtedly challenge views on\nthe balance of ecosystem services that it is most\nappropriate to derive from specific forests, and the forest\nsector needs to develop frameworks within which sound\ndecision making can be adapted. Some current\nmanagement options will become inappropriate. Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4\net al (2009, p 136) use the term \u2018adaptive co-management\u2019\nto indicate that forest management should be based on\nmonitoring and learning \u2013 that is, mistakes will be made,\nbut lessons need to be learnt from them. Different\nclimates, species and management objectives mean that no\nmanagement regime will be universally appropriate for all\nforests. Instead managers will need flexibility. There may\nbe a need to plant new species or cultivars with improved\ninsect and disease resistance. The optimal rotation length\nmay increase if the value of carbon storage increases, even\nto the extent that harvesting becomes uneconomic (van\nKooten et al, 1995). Wider tree spacings and use of stands\nof mixed species and ages may be introduced to reduce\nthe susceptibility of the forest system to wind damage,\ndrought stress or pest damage (Galik and Jackson, 2009).\nFinally, the term \u2018adaptive co-management\u2019 recognizes the\nwider impact of forest management on a range of\nstakeholders. For this reason, it is important that forest\nmanagers should engage key local stakeholders in the\ndevelopment of forest management plans.\nReferences\nAngelsen, A., ed (2008), Moving Ahead with REDD: Issues, Options\nand Implications, CIFOR, Bogor, Indonesia.\nBarker, T., et al (2007), \u2018Technical summary\u2019, in Metz, B.,\nDavidson, O.
