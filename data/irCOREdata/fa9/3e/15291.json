The German results \nindicate that relationship tenure is not related to LMX. However, span of supervision is \nshown to be relevant in the followers\u201f evaluation of LMX. With respect to the \nconsequences of LMX, results indicate that delegation as well as commitment and \noccupational self-efficacy are positively related to LMX. Some of the results differ from \nUS results, namely, antecedents are related to LM X to a lower degree in Germany and \nconsequences to a higher degree. Based on these results, future research should take into \naccount the country in which the LMX data is collected in order to be able to make \nmore precise statements about the respective relationships. \n \nKeywords: Leadership, LMX, Commitment, Self-efficacy \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 3 \nComparing Antecedents and Consequences of Leader-Member Exchange in a German \nWorking Context to Findings in the US \nDansereau, Graen, and Haga (1975) first introduced Leader-Member Exchange (LMX). \nIt is based on the Vertical Dyad Linkage (VDL) approach and refers to the idea that \nleadership is built on the dyadic relationships between a leader and each of his \/ her \nfollowers. Graen and colleagues went beyond prior approaches, which had put leaders\u201f \nbehaviour or traits in the foreground, and argued that the variance often found in the \nperception of leadership is due to the fact that leadership is dyad-based rather than team-\nbased. This means that there might well be as many leadership styles as there are leader-\nmember dyads. The Leader-Member Exchange approach is a further development of \nthis idea and focuses on the quality of the relationship between one leader and one \nsubordinate (for a differentiation between VDL and LMX, see Dansereau, Yammarino, \n& Markham, 1995).  \nWhile quite popular in the USA, Leader-Member Exchange has only recently \nbeen introduced to German-speaking countries through Schyns\u201f (2002) translation of \nthe LMX 7 instrument (original by Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). A more recent work by \nSchyns (2004b) outlines that most other work on LMX in Germany is either still in \nprogress or focuses on theoretical aspects (e.g., Schyns, 2004a; Weibler, 1994). The aim \nof this paper is, therefore, twofold. First, it gives a summary of results of a German \nresearch project on antecedents and consequences of LMX. Second, it compares these \nresults to results found in prior US studies. The question arises as to whether US \nfindings on LMX can be transferred to the German context or whether we can expect to \nfind differences between German and American results. In order to answer these \nquestions, it is useful to approach the issue from a broad cultural perspective. We will \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 4 \ndo so after reviewing the constructs assessed in this study and their relationship to \nLMX. \nFigure 1 displays the antecedents and consequences of LMX which were \nincluded. Naturally, we could not include all possible antecedents and consequences in \nour study but had to make some reasonable choices. An obvious first criterion for the \nselection, based on the purposes of our study, was that research on LMX and the \nrespective other variable had to exist in the USA. As for the antecedents, not much \nresearch exists in the field of LMX. The research available focuses on work-related \nbiographical variables. As LMX is relationship-oriented, we chose criteria that have an \nimpact on that relationship - namely, relationship tenure (the duration of leader and \nfollower working together) and span of leadership (the number of followers per leader).  \nThe decision for consequences was more difficult, as a lot of research exists in \nthe field of consequences of LMX. We chose to take the following approach: First, we \nconsidered what kinds of consequences leadership has in general and then, second, took \none prominent example. For \u201eleaders\u201f behaviours\u201f, we selected \u201edelegation\u201f; for the \ngeneral leadership consequence \u201efollowers\u201f attitudes\u201f, we selected \u201eaffective \ncommitment\u201f; and for \u201eempowering of followers\u201f, we selected \u201eoccupational self-\nefficacy\u201f. Let us elaborate briefly on the examples we chose. \n---- Insert Figure 1 about here ---- \nDelegation can be seen as a pivotal variable in understanding the interaction \nbetween member and leader (Bauer & Green, 1996). A leader\u201fs duties include the \nassignment of tasks to his\/her followers. There is a certain degree of freedom to \ndelegation, that is, leaders can assign more or less challenging tasks to their followers. \nThe assignment of challenging tasks to a follower can be regarded as a sign of trust in \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 5 \nthis follower (that he\/she will fulfil this task to the supervisor\u201fs satisfaction) and also as \na sign of support (as challenging tasks involve learning opportunities). Delegation of \ndifficult and challenging tasks seems to be more frequent in high-quality LMX \nrelationships than in low-quality LMX relationships. In the latter case, supervisors \nassign daily and routine tasks to their subordinates. \nCommitment is a psychological state that characterizes the relationship which an \nemployee has to his \/ her organization and which influences whether or not an employee \nstays in the organization (Meyer & Allen, 1991). Meyer and Allen (1991) describe three \ncomponents of commitment \u2013 affective, continuance, and normative. Affective \ncommitment refers to the emotional bonding with the organisation, whereas continuance \ncommitment is related to a perceived lack of other job opportunities. Normatively \ncommitted employees feel obliged to stay in their organisation because changing a job \nis just \u201cnot done\u201d. As leaders represent the organisation vis-\u00e0-vis their followers, we \nassume that relationship quality has an influence on affective commitment. \nOccupational self-efficacy can be defined as \u201cone\u201fs belief in one\u201fs own ability \nand competence to perform successfully and effectively in situations and across \ndifferent tasks in a job\u201d (Schyns & von Collani, 2002). Different kinds of experiences \ncan enhance the occupational self-efficacy of employees. In the context of leadership, \nmastery experience and verbal persuasion are of relevance. As detailed in Schyns \n(2001), supervisors can provide opportunities for their subordinates to perform new \ntasks and thus offer opportunities for mastery experience. In addition, leaders can \nsupport their subordinates\u201f self-efficacy by verbal persuasion in the sense of praising \ntheir efforts or focusing on good results (see also Schyns, 2004, for a theoretical \nexplanation of the relationship between leadership and self-efficacy). \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 6 \nWe did not include \u201eperformance\u201f for practical reasons: Our samples are \nheterogeneous with respect to professions and tasks, so general performance criteria \nwould be hard to find. However, this is certainly a task for future research. In the next \nsection, results of relevant US studies are reported along with each antecedent or \nconsequence. We will then  review cultural differences between Germany and the US in \norder to derive possible assumptions regarding cultural differences in the relationships \nbetween antecedents\/consequences and LMX. \nAntecedents of LMX \nIn the following section, relationship tenure and span of leadership are considered as \nantecedents of Leader-Member Exchange.  \nRelationship tenure \nHow is the amount of time which leader and member have worked together related to \nthe quality of their relationship? In organizations, leaders and followers often work \ntogether for longer periods of time. Nevertheless, particular work groups are not stable, \nas members leave and new members join the group. Thus, work groups are composed of \nfollowers who have spent different amounts of time with their supervisor. As a \nconsequence, especially in the context of LMX where dyads are the focus of attention, it \nis interesting to examine the extent to which relationship tenure is related to LMX \nquality. Although some researchers found that the LMX-relationship develops early in \nsupervisor-subordinate dyads (within the first two weeks; see Liden, Wayne, & Stilwell, \n1993), it can be assumed that LMX quality continues to improve over the span of time \nin which leaders and followers get to know each other better. In addition, followers who \nexperience low LMX will tend to leave their positions in order to work for a new leader \n(in or out of the company; Graen, Liden, & Hoel, 1982; Kacmar, Carlson, & Brymer, \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 7 \n1999; Maslyn & Fedor, 1998). Maslyn and Uhl-Bien (2001) report a positive \nrelationship between LMX and relationship tenure for different assessments of LMX, as \nwell as for supervisors\u201f and subordinates\u201f ratings of LMX. Consequently, we expect \nLMX to be higher in long-term relationships.  \nH 1: Relationship tenure is positively related to LMX. \nSpan of leadership \nLeaders lead groups of different sizes. Whereas some leaders may have to supervise \nonly a few subordinates, others have to lead larger groups. As LMX is based on \ninterpersonal exchange (see Liden, Sparrowe, & Wayne, 1997), the question arises as to \nthe extent that leaders with large groups of followers are still able to establish a positive \nrelationship quality with all followers. Dansereau, Graen, and Haga had mentioned as \nearly as 1975 that leaders\u201f limited resources in time and energy also limit the number of \nhigh-quality relationships possible. Time as well as energy might not be sufficient to \nuphold a large number of high-quality relationships (see Dansereau et al., 1975). \nEmpirical findings support this assumption (Schriesheim, Castro, & Yammarino, 2000, \nGreen, Anderson, & Shivers, 1996). Therefore, we will consider a high span of \nleadership as a negative antecedent of LMX. \nH 2: Span of leadership is negatively related to LMX.  \nConsequences of LMX  \nThe relationship between LMX and performance has been shown to be positive in \nseveral studies (e.g. Dunegan, Duchon, & Uhl-Bien, 1992; Graen, Novak, & \nSommerkamp, 1982) as well as in a meta-analysis by Gerstner and Day (1997). In the \nfollowing section, we will take a closer look at different consequences of LMX and the \nrespective results from US studies.  \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 8 \nDelegation \nAs reasoned above, leaders\u201f behaviour in terms of delegation should be positively \nrelated to LMX. This assumption finds support in prior research. Yukl and Fu (1999) \nfound that leaders tend to delegate challenging tasks to those followers to whom they \nhave a positive (LMX) relationship (see also Schriesheim, Neider, & Scandura, 1998; \nSchriesheim, Neider; Scandura, & Tepper, 1992). Therefore, delegation of challenging \ntasks (in particular) can be regarded as a result of a good relationship quality in the \nsense of LMX.  \nH 3: LMX is positively related to delegation.  \nAffective Commitment \nWe argued above that the leader represents the organization for the follower, so we can \nexpect LMX to be positively related to affective commitment. Empirical results support \nthis notion: Schriesheim, Neider, Scandura, and Tepper (1992) found a positive \nrelationship between LMX and commitment (see also Sherony & Green, 2002). We \nconclude: \nH 4: LMX is positively related to affective commitment. \nOccupational self-efficacy \nAs the leader is thought to be able to influence followers\u201f occupational self-efficacy, \nand is thought to do so in positive LMX relationships, we assume that LMX and \noccupational self-efficacy are positively related. In an empirical study, Murphy and \nEnsher (1999) did in fact find that leading in an LMX-way enhances followers\u201f self-\nefficacy (for an overview of the correlations found in the US for LMX and the concepts \nregarded here, see Table 1). \nH 5: LMX is positively related to occupational self-efficacy. \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 9 \n--- Insert Table 1 about here --- \nCultural differences between Germany and the US \nHofstede (1996) referred to cultural differences between Germany and the US with \nrespect to five cultural dimensions (power distance, individualism, masculinity, \nuncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation). He found that German and US-\nemployees differ only with respect to the latter two dimensions (uncertainty avoidance \nand long term orientation) but not with respect to the former dimensions. While the US \nemployees are low in uncertainty avoidance and in long-term orientation, German \nemployees are on an intermediate level in these categories compared to other countries. \nConsequently, Germans prefer structured over unstructured situations to a higher degree \nthan US-Americans, as the difference in uncertainty avoidance suggests. Being higher \nin long-term orientation means that Germans tend to be more oriented towards the past \nin comparison to US-Americans. In addition, Hofstede, van Deusen, Mueller, Charles, \nand The Business Network (2002) found that the goals of US- and German managers \ndiffer. German managers seem to put more emphasis on the relationship they have with \ntheir employees (or rather, they indicate that they attach more importance to a sense of \nresponsibility for their employees) than US-managers do. We can expect that this has an \nimpact on LMX in a way that managers try to uphold a good relationship with their \nemployees to a higher degree in Germany than in the US.  \nA similar dimension is addressed in the GLOBE (Global Leadership and \nOrganizational Behaviour Effectiveness) study (e.g., House, Javidan, & Dorfman, \n2001). Reviewing the Germanic cluster of the GLOBE study, Szabo, Brodbeck, Den \nHartog, Reber, Weibler, and Wunderer (2002) outlined results on participation. They \nused a type of necessity rating, asking middle managers to rate items on a scale ranging \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 10 \nfrom \u201cThis behaviour or characteristic greatly inhibits a person from being an \noutstanding leader\u201d to \u201cThis behaviour or characteristic greatly contributes to a person \nbeing an outstanding leader\u201d. German- and Dutch-speaking countries attach a higher \nimportance to participation compared to other countries. This may be due to the German \ntradition of union participation in important management decisions. One could argue \nthat, due to this existing means of employee participation, German managers are \naccustomed to taking their employees\u201f opinions into account. However, Hunt (2002) \nreports a somewhat contradictory result: namely, that German managers rate the \nnecessity of competencies related to leadership and team building significantly lower \nthan US managers. Examples of such competencies are: \u201cCoaching and developing \nothers\u201d and \u201cproviding individualized consideration to subordinates\u201d. Precisely these \nkinds of competencies are reflected in the concept of LMX. \nA review of the latest results obtained by the GLOBE research group (House, \nHanges, Javidan, Dorfman, Gupta and GLOBE associates, 2004) offers support for \nHunt\u201fs results rather than for the conclusion we draw from Hofstede\u201fs research: The \nresults with respect to two dimensions in particular, namely, \u201chumane orientation\u201d \n(organizational or societal encouragement of and the giving of rewards to individuals \nwho are fair, altruistic, friendly, generous, caring, and kind towards others) and \u201cteam \noriented leadership\u201d (the emphasis on effective team building and implementation of a \ncommon purpose or goal among team members) show a less positive picture of \nGermany, in comparison to the US, than our interpretation of Hofstede\u201fs results \nsuggests. In both cases Germany scores lower than the US (Dorfman, Hanges, \nBrodbeck, & Project GLOBE associates, 2004; see also Ashkanasy, Trevor-Roberts, & \nEarnshaw, 2002, for results on the Anglo cluster). Dorfman et al. (2004) even report \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 11 \nslightly higher values for \u201cparticipation\u201d in the USA than in Germany when regarding \nthe country level rather than the country cluster level, as Szabo et al. (2002) do.  \nBased on the theory and research discussed above, what can we expect when \ncomparing LMX research results in Germany to results in the US? On the one hand, if \nwe focus on the research that indicates that German managers rate relationship-related \ncompetencies as less important (Hunt, 2002), that they execute less team-orientated \nleadership and are less rewarded for their \u201chumane orientation\u201d (Dorfman et al., 2004), \nwe may expect that they show less LMX-related behaviour. On the other hand, results \nreported by Hofstede et al. (2002) would allow us to assume that German managers \nengage in higher LMX-relationships (that is, they place more emphasis on a high quality \nrelationship with their subordinates) than US-managers. Although the results obtained \nby the GLOBE research group are more recent and more specific than those obtained by \nHofstede, they are still somewhat contradictory in themselves, with Szabo et al. \nemphasizing the participation aspect of the Germanic work culture and Dorfman et al. \nfinding lower values for \u201chumane orientation\u201d, \u201cteam-oriented leadership\u201d and even \n\u201cparticipation\u201d in German samples than in US samples (country-level). The latter results \nare of course more directly connected to leadership style and, consequently, more \nrelevant for assumptions about LMX in both countries. In any case, in light of the \ndiffering findings between the GLOBE findings and Hofstede\u201fs et al. (2002) results, it \ndoes not seem possible to derive clear-cut hypotheses with respect to differences in the \nrelationship between antecedents\/outcomes and LMX in both countries. We will \ntherefore frame this study as an exploratory study. In this sense, we will examine the \nrelationships between antecedents\/outcomes and LMX in Germany and attempt to \nvalidate the generalizability of the original US-based approach to LMX. \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 12 \nMethod \nParticipants and procedure: General  \nAll samples reported here come from larger studies on leadership. We chose the \nrespective samples for our study as they all included LMX and one or more antecedent \nand \/ or consequence. All samples involve employees from different professions and \npositions. Although one sample consists mainly of employees in lower levels of \nhierarchy, in general, the participants worked on different levels of hierarchy. None of \nthe participants were self-employed. Wherever possible, the samples were combined for \nthe analyses in order to achieve higher power for the hypotheses tests. Only data \nrelevant to our research question are reported here.  \nSample 1\ni\n \nDescription: The first sample consisted of 326 subordinates: 196 of them were male, \n124 female (6 missing). Of the subordinates, 257 worked for a male leader, 69 were \nsubordinate to a female leader. The mean indicated age of the participants was 39 years \n(SD = 9.6). On average, they reported having worked in their company for 13.8 years \n(SD = 10.3). Nearly the whole sample reported having a lower level of education, with \nonly 9.8% of the participants having graduated from (German) high school. Participants \nworked in different professions and organizations on lower levels of hierarchy. \nProcedure: Participants were selected on the condition that they were presently \nworking in a hierarchically low position. Questioning took place in a group setting. \nMost participants filled out the questionnaire during working hours (N = 255). The \nquestionnaires were recollected directly after being filled out. Participants were \ninformed that the questionnaires would only be used for scientific purposes and \nanonymity was guaranteed. \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 13 \nSample 2\nii\n \nDescription: The second sample consisted of 252 subordinates: Most of the respondents \nwere female (109 male and 141 female, 2 missing). Of the employees, 182 worked for a \nmale supervisor, 67 for a female supervisor (3 missing). The average indicated age of \nparticipants was 34.4 years (SD = 11.56 years; 43 persons did not indicate their age). \nOn average, the employees reported having worked in their company for 4.8 years (SD \n= 4 years). Nearly half (45.6%) of the participants reported having graduated from \n(German) high school.  \nProcedure: Questionnaires were distributed personally within the organizations. \nIn part, employees were asked to distribute questionnaires among their acquaintances, \nobserving strictly that these persons were not the immediate superiors of respondents. \nMost of the participating employees completed the questionnaire in a private setting. \nOne part of the completed questionnaires was recollected by one of the authors, another \npart was returned in envelopes provided by the university. Confidentiality of data \ntreatment was assured. \nSample 3\niii\n \nDescription: The third sample consisted of 76 subordinates. Most of the respondents \nwere female (31 male and 45 female). Of the employees, 48 worked for a male \nsupervisor, 27 for a female supervisor (1 missing). The average indicated age of \nparticipants was 34.8 years (SD = 11.7 years). On average, the employees reported \nhaving worked in their company for 5.3 years (SD = 6.2). Half of the participants \nreported having successfully passed (German) high school examinations. Participants \nworked in different professions and organizations.  \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 14 \nProcedure: Participants were selected on the condition that they were presently \nworking and that they have a direct supervisor. The questionnaires were distributed \namongst the acquaintances of the authors and of students taking part in an advanced \ncourse on research methods. The participants could choose when and where to fill in the \nquestionnaire. Students and the authors re-collected the questionnaires. Participants \nwere guaranteed anonymity. \nSample 4\niv\n \nDescription: The fourth sample consisted of 141 subordinates. Again, most of the \nrespondents were female (61 male and 80 female). Of the employees, 89 worked for a \nmale supervisor, 52 for a female supervisor. The average indicated age of participants \nwas 37.4 years (SD = 12.9 years). On average, the employees indicated having worked \nin their company for 7.3 years (SD = 8.7). More than a third (39.1%) of the participants \nreported having passed (German) high school exams. Participants worked in different \nprofessions and organizations on different levels of hierarchy.  \nProcedure: The procedure of data collection was identical to that in Sample 3. \nInstruments \nLeader-Member Exchange was assessed in all samples with the 7-item instrument \nrecommended by Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995, German translation: Schyns, 2002). An \nexample item is: \u201dHow well does your leader understand your problems and needs?\u201d \nThe Likert-scale ranges from 1 to 5 with different verbal anchors. Based on 908 \nparticipants from all samples, the internal consistency (Cronbach\u201fs Alpha) was .88. For \nthe internal consistencies of the individual samples, see Table 2. \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 15 \nRelationship tenure was assessed in the samples 1 to 4. Participants were asked \nto indicate how long they had worked with their respective supervisor. On average, the \nparticipants had worked with their supervisor for 3.2 years (SD = 3.29). \nSpan of leadership was only assessed in Sample 2. Participants were asked how \nmany followers the direct supervisor has authority over.  \nDelegation was assessed in Sample 2. The delegation scale was adapted from \nthe Managerial Practices Survey (MPS, see Yukl, Wall & Lepsinger, 1990; Yukl & Fu, \n1999). Participants filled in the subscale \u201cdelegation\u201d consisting of 7 items. The Likert-\nscale ranges from 1 (never) to 5 (always). One example item is: \u201cMy boss delegates the \nauthority to me to make important decisions and to implement these without his\/her \nprior approval\u201d. The reliability for the sample (N = 252) was \u03b1 = .83 for six items \n(Cronbach\u201fs Alpha, one item deleted).  \nCommitment was assessed in Sample 2 and Sample 4 using different \ninstruments. In Sample 3, the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire developed by \nMowday, Steers, and Porter (1979) was used. The scale consists of 15 items with a 5-\npoint Likert-scale (1 = strongly agree to 5 = strongly disagree). One example item is: \u201cI \nam proud to tell others that I am part of this organization.\u201d The instrument had an \ninternal consistency (Cronbach\u201fs Alpha) of \u03b1 = .92 in this sample. \nIn Sample 4, it was necessary to employ a shorter instrument for assessing \ncommitment, due to the length of the entire questionnaire. We therefore used a subscale \nof the commitment instrument by Allen and Meyer (1990) assessing affective \ncommitment. It consists of 8 items and can be answered on a 7-point-Likert scale (1 = \ndo not agree at all to 7 = agree completely). An example-item is: \u201cI would be very \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 16 \nhappy to spend the rest of my career in this organization.\u201d The instrument had an \ninternal consistency (Cronbach\u201fs alpha) of \u03b1 = .77. \nOccupational self-efficacy was assessed in Samples 1, 3, and 4 using Schyns and \nvon Collani\u201fs (2002) OCCSEFF scale. The scale consists of 20 items. The reliability for \nthe three samples (N = 543) was .86. A sample item is: \u201cNo matter what comes my way \nin my job, I\u201fm usually able to handle it \u201c. The scale ranges from 1 = completely true to \n6= not at all true. For the internal consistencies of the individual samples, see Table 2. \n--- Insert Table 2 about here --- \nResults \nAntecedents of LMX \nIn order to test H1, a correlation was conducted between relationship tenure and LMX \n(Samples 1 to 4). No significant correlation (r = .00) emerged between the two \nconstructs. For more analytic purposes, a t-test with the groups with the lowest and \nhighest values of relationship tenure (tertile split, that is, creating three groups with \nrespect to their values in relationship tenure, leaving out the middle values group for the \ncalculations) was executed. No significant differences on LMX emerged between the \ngroups. Therefore, H1 has to be rejected. \nH2 was supported, as a significant correlation emerged between span of \nleadership and LMX (sample 2; r = - .14; p <.05), indicating that the more followers a \nleader has, the lower these rate the quality of the relationship with their leader. \nConsequences of LMX \nThe correlation between LMX and delegation was positive and significant (Sample 2; r \n= .58; p <.001), indicating more delegation in high LMX relationships. Thus, H3 is \nsupported.  \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 17 \nUsing the Organization Commitment Questionnaire (Mowday et al., 1979) to \nassess commitment, a positive correlation emerged for LMX and commitment (Sample \n3; r = .63; p <.001). For the affective commitment instrument (Meyer et al., 1991) and \nLMX, the correlation was r = .44 (p <.001) (Sample 5). Therefore, H4 was supported. \nLeader-Member Exchange and occupational self-efficacy were correlated \nsignificantly and positively (Samples 1, 3, 4; r = .19; p <.001). Thus, H5 was supported. \nComparison between German and US findings \nGiven that the present findings are the first ones obtained in a German context, and most \nof the existing research on antecedents and consequences of LMX was conducted in the \nUSA, it is of interest to see whether or not there are any deviations between these two \nresearch bodies. The most systematic way to approach this task is to conduct several \nsmall meta-analyses of the correlations found between LMX and its antecedents and \nconsequences. In order to do so, we compared the results found in our samples to those \nfound in the relevant prior studies in the US (i.e., those featured in Table 1), using \nnational context (US versus Germany) as a moderator variable. We are well aware of \nthe fact that the number of studies included in each of these meta-analyses is quite \nsmall, and therefore only limited conclusions can be drawn from them. Still, it seems \nclear that a quantitative analysis yields more precise insights than a purely narrative \nreview.  \nFollowing the meta-analytic approach and procedures suggested by Hedges and \nOlkin (1985) and Cooper and Hedges (1994), we included all of the US and German \nstudies pertaining to a certain correlation (e.g., between LMX and relationship tenure; \nsee Table 1 for the studies included with respect to each LMX correlate). Thereby, the \ndifferent German sub-samples reported here were treated as separate studies. We then \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 18 \nconducted a moderator analysis to see whether the national context (US versus \nGermany) was significantly related to the variance in the observed effect sizes (here, the \ncorrelation coefficients r). This analysis subdivides the overall between-study variance \nin effect sizes into variance between classes of studies (i.e., US and German studies) \nand remaining variance within these classes. Ideally, if there is substantial between-\nclass but negligible (i.e., not exceeding chance) within-class variance, we can say that \nthe variance in effect sizes is explained by the moderator variable.  \nThe results of these analyses with respect to various antecedents and \nconsequences of LMX are shown in Table 3. The second column gives the between-\nclass test statistics Qb for four LMX correlates. As it turned out, the only clear-cut \ndifference between US and German studies was obtained with respect to the correlation \nbetween LMX and delegation. As the estimated class-level effects (given in the fourth \ncolumn) show, the relationship between these variables is much stronger in the German \nstudy (r = .58) than in the US studies (estimated class-level r = .36). This finding is \nqualified, however, by the significant homogeneity statistic Qw (given in the last \ncolumn), indicating that larger-than-chance variability remains within the US studies, \nwhich is still unaccounted for. The only other moderating effect of national context that \napproaches significance is found for the correlation between LMX and relationship \ntenure, which appears to be somewhat stronger in the US study (r = .15) than in the \nGerman studies (estimated class-level r = .02), although on a very low overall level. In \nthis case, Qw within the German studies is not significant, indicating that the effect sizes \nare homogenous. No moderating effects of the national context are found for the \nrelationships between LMX and span of supervision, or for LMX and self-efficacy.  \n--- Insert Table 3 about here --- \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 19 \nIn addition to the four LMX correlates considered in the above moderator \nanalyses, a fifth correlate of LMX featured in Table 1, \u201ecommitment\u201f, was also \nconsidered. Because the reported US correlation between LMX and this variable was \nalready the outcome of a meta-analysis (Gerstner & Day, 1997), a different approach \nwas chosen here to assess possible differences in effect sizes relating to national \ncontext. Since it is possible to calculate confidence intervals for meta-analytically \nestimated effect sizes (here again, correlations), and the 95 per cent confidence interval \nfor the LMX-commitment correlation can be deduced from the Gerstner and Day data \n(see Table 2 on p. 833), we can do the same for the two relevant German studies and see \nhow much the US and German confidence intervals overlap. As it turned out, the two \nintervals for r did not overlap at all (US studies: .33 - .37; German studies: .52 - .65). \nThis means that we can be quite confident that national context plays a role in the LMX-\ncommitment relationship. The latter is far stronger in the German than in the US studies. \nHowever, it should be mentioned that sufficient heterogeneity remains within the \nGerman studies, as indicated by Qw = 5.82, p < .05. The same was true for the US \nstudies analysed by Gerstner and Day (1997; see the Q statistic reported in Table 5 on p. \n835). This suggests that other variables than national context may also moderate the \nLMX-commitment relationship. To summarize, relationship tenure correlates lower \nwith LMX in Germany than in the US and the correlation between LMX and \nconsequences (delegation and commitment) is higher in Germany than in the US. \nSummary and discussion \nWe provided an overview of the results of some studies on LMX in Germany. The \nresults obtained were compared to results from prior studies in the US. Relationship \ntenure and span of leadership were considered as antecedents of Leader-Member \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 20 \nExchange. Delegation, commitment, and self-efficacy were regarded as consequences of \nLMX. Summarizing the German findings, we found that of the antecedents only span of \nleadership turned out to have a significant, negative impact on the relationship quality \nbetween leader and member (as rated by the member). All consequences were found to \nbe positively related to LMX. \nWe will now have a closer look at the results concerning the antecedents of \nLMX. Contrary to our assumptions and to results reported by Maslyn and Uhl-Bien \n(2001), no relationship emerged between LMX and relationship tenure. Possibly, this \nresult is related to special features of our sample. Most of our participants came from \nareas with high unemployment and high job insecurity because of downsizing and \nbankruptcies. Therefore, deliberate turnover is difficult due to the economic background \nin the respective regions. This may lead to lower fluctuation within the organization as \nwell as between organizations. Even within-organizational change is less probable in \ntimes of downsizing, as fewer vacancies are available. Generally, opportunities to leave \nthe dyad are rare for employees, independent of the relationship towards their \nsupervisors. We could therefore expect that followers cope with their working \nconditions (of which supervisors are a part) by lowering their expectations, and, as a \nresult, report higher values of LMX. This might result in a ceiling effect and, \nconsequently; lower the correlation between LMX and other variables. The lowering of \nexpectations is comparable to the effect of resignative job satisfaction, where \nsatisfaction is not based on met expectations but on lowered expectations (Bruggemann, \n1976). In a work environment where employees cannot leave the dyad, a supervisor will \nhave to cope with good and bad relationships towards different followers over a longer \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 21 \nperiod of time. It would be interesting to investigate how this affects the performance of \nthe team as a whole.  \nWe found that the more followers a leader has, the less LMX these followers \nreport (span of leadership). This is equally true for German and US-data. Thus, we can \nassume this to be a fairly general relationship. It would be interesting to see whether \nthere is a \u201ccut-off-point\u201d beyond which high quality LMX-relationships are no longer \npossible. It can be assumed that this cut-off-point is not independent of a leader\u201fs \ncharacteristics. A more extraverted supervisor might be more capable of establishing \nquite a few positive relationships in comparison to a less extraverted one. In addition, \nthe possible number of positive relationships may also be dependent upon the leader\u201fs \ntask. For example, one could imagine that an emotionally exhausting task leaves less \nenergy to establish good LMX-relationships with followers. On the followers\u201f side, if \ntheir task is routine and isolated, it may leave less necessity and opportunity for \npersonal interaction with the leader or for supportive leader behaviour. A low rate of \nmutual contact should, therefore, reduce the opportunity to build a high-quality \nrelationship. \nRegarding consequences of LMX, both in the US (Yukl & Fu, 1999) and in \nGermany, subordinates\u201f evaluation of the relationship to their leader is positively related \nto delegation. One might speculate that subordinates with a good relationship towards \ntheir leaders feel supported by them (see Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995) and, therefore, tend \nto ask for more challenging tasks themselves. We can assume that a good relationship \nbetween supervisor and follower enhances opportunities for learning (as given by the \nleader). Notwithstanding these general and positive, culturally-independent influences, \nthe relationship between LMX and delegation seems to be higher in Germany than in \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 22 \nthe US, although more research is needed to confirm our results. The differences found \ncan be interpreted in terms of the cultural differences found in Hofstede\u201fs work. \nHofstede\u201fs data revealed that Germans show more uncertainty avoidance than US-\nAmericans. This may have an effect on delegation in so far as German managers may \ntend to delegate to the \u201csafe\u201d candidate, that is, to the one with whom they have the best \nLMX relationship, which would explain the high positive correlation. However, it could \nalso mean that the relationship quality increases with delegation, meaning that German \nworkers like their supervisors more if the supervisors delegate more challenging tasks to \nthem (in particular, when they consider these tasks to lie within their abilities and to \nimply the leader\u201fs trust in them). Furthermore, it should be taken into account that the \nmeasurement of delegation was different in all samples, which could also account for \nthe differences found between the studies. \nOur hypothesis concerning commitment was supported as well, even when \nmeasured with different instruments and across different samples. This result is in line \nwith US (Schriesheim, Neider, Scandura, & Tepper, 1992) as well as Dutch findings \n(van Breukelen, Konst, & van der Vlist, 2002). Consequently, leader-member \nrelationships are important with respect to followers\u201f feelings of attachment to the \norganization. In addition, these relationships are more important for commitment in \nGermany than in the US. We have to keep the different operationalizations in Germany \nand the US in mind as one possible explanation of this result: Whereas we focused on \naffective commitment, Gerstner and Day (1997) used a broader definition. The \nrelationship quality between leader and member, however, is more important for \naffective commitment than for general commitment, which may account for the higher \nrelationships in the German studies.  \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 23 \nIn any case, the emotional attachment becomes a very important resource, \nespecially in times of flexibility and loss of conventional employer-employee \nrelationships, as is discussed in the understanding of \u201epsychological contracts\u201f (Schalk \n& Rousseau, 2001). The required flexibility could reduce emotional commitment to the \norganization, which could then have a negative influence on factors such as obligation \nand performance. \u201cHidden costs\u201d, for example, motivational deficits and decreased \nperformance caused by restructuring and downsizing, must be compensated. The \nbuilding of high-quality relationships to employees seems to be an effective way for \nsupervisors to do so, especially for German managers.  \nAnother major resource in companies is occupational self-efficacy. As \nhypothesized, LMX and occupational self-efficacy are positively related. This result is \nsimilar to results of US studies (e.g., Murphy & Ensher, 1999). Graen (2003) even \nindicates that self-efficacy may be considered a dimension of LMX. Because self-\nefficacy and work-related performance are positively related, as Stajkovic and Luthan \n(1998) found in their meta-analysis, enhancing self-efficacy through LMX may be a \nway to indirectly improve followers\u201f performance.  \nThe last two results indicate the importance of relationships between leaders and \nfollowers in companies. For companies, these results may indicate not only that they \nshould focus on leaders or leaders\u201f behaviour (as is often done in the case of training) \nbut also on the relationship quality between member and leader, as well as within \ngroups (see solidarity behaviour, Koster, Sanders, & van Emmerik, 2002, or Team \nMember Exchange, Seers, Petty, & Cashman, 1995). \nLimitations and future research \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 24 \nIn all reported samples, it was only possible to use self-report data. As is quite common \nin LMX research in the US, we only assessed the quality of relationship from the \nperspective of the followers. Although the original approach of LMX included the idea \nof assessing LMX from both the members\u201f and the leaders\u201f perspectives, research \nshowed lower reliabilities for the leaders\u201f than for followers\u201f assessments (\u03b1= .78 for \nleaders and \u03b1 = .89 followers in a meta-analysis by Gerstner & Day, 1997) and a low \ncorrelation between the two perspectives (r = .30 according to Gerstner & Day, 1997). \nTherefore, it can be judged as acceptable to use only the followers\u201f perspective in this \nstudy. However, we have to keep the fact in mind that, when using this kind of \nassessment, we are only assessing the followers\u201f perception and not how others (leaders, \npeers) may view the LMX-relationship. Nevertheless, including only the level of \nmembers may be sufficient, because the relationship perceived by members is relevant \nto explaining effects caused in the members.  \nFuture research should take into account the group composition in which the \ndyads perform. From research on tokens, we know that, in work groups, minorities in \nparticular are subjected to different standards (see Pazy & Oron, 2001, on women in an \nIsraeli military context). This may make a difference with respect to the individual \nrelationships within the groups (see Sparrowe & Liden, 1997). Organizational culture \nmay matter for the individual dyads, as embedded intergroup relations theory suggests \n(Alderfer & Smith, 1982; see also argumentation by Nkomo & Cox, 1996). We can \nassume that employees belonging to a minority do not feel equally integrated in groups \nand, as a consequence, experience less LMX.  \nAs for the antecedents of LMX, other constructs than the ones tested here may \nbe of importance: As cited above, the composition of the group may be relevant to the \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 25 \nrelationship quality, as research on diversity suggests (see Scandura and Lankau, 1996). \nThe task may play a role in so far as it may or may not leave room for relationships to \ndevelop. The relationship quality may differ depending on how often leader and \nmembers have contact while working. These two points should be addressed by future \nresearch. \nAnother limitation is that we could not include more than the above-mentioned \nconsequences of LMX. Future research should address this topic by examining other \nconsequences of LMX in the German work context. Especially interesting could be a \ncomparison between effects of LMX on employees\u201f attitudes and effects on their actual \nperformance. \nConclusion \nUsing different samples and \u2013 at least for some of the analyses \u2013 large sample sizes, we \nhave shown that LMX is related to outcomes in the German working context. While this \nis in line with results reported by US studies, fewer antecedents were detected. \nNevertheless, knowing about the consequences of LMX is helpful in organisational \ncontexts. As Schyns (2004) argues, LMX is also positively related to preparedness for \nchange \u2013 prior to, during, and after change is introduced. Therefore, considering the \npresent economic situation, which requires employee flexibility (see van Dam, 2003), \nsupervisor support as indicated by LMX is an important resource in companies. In \ngeneral, it seems that we know more about what results from a good quality relationship \nwith the leader than about what enhances this quality. It is obviously important for \ncompanies to emphasize the relationship quality within their work groups in order to \nattain desired outcomes. As we do not know much about how the mechanism of the \ndevelopment of LMX works at this moment (at least in Germany), apart from \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 26 \ntheoretical assumptions, we can only recommend enhancing relationship quality by \ntaking into account the size of the group and perhaps by training leaders and followers \nor giving them space to develop their relationship. Even in times of lean management, it \nremains particularly important for supervisors to have a \u201cmanageable\u201d work group size \nin order to establish positive relationships to followers. Regarding antecedents of LMX, \nit appears to be useful to take the culture in which the relationships are grounded into \naccount, as the results reveal at least some differences between Germany and the US. \nAntecedents and consequences of LMX \n \nPage 27 \nReferences \nAlderfer, C.
